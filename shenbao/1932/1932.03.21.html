<h3 id="c1">讀中國銀行二十年度報告（二）彬· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>吾人於把握資本主義轉入第三時期。其恐慌與動搖較諸戰後爲異其性質而成爲無可挽救之痼疾一前提而後。則可知中行報告中「民國二十年度全世界·經濟狀况·去年衰敗之後·不獨毫無轉機抑且更趨惡化」之指陳自爲必然之現象。豈僅二十年度。或且永無繁榮復興之一日。　　資本主義一方面。竭力以在市塲尋覓利潤。另一方面又要求大衆之購買力。日益增高。然而事實上一般人民。盡困頓於極端貧困悲境之日亦即其購買力低减至最低限度之時。故雖資本主義之倉庫中滿儲一切工業上之產品。膨脹至不可耐。而飢寒之人民。仍無力一顧。故由於農業之凋敝農村之購買力。日益减低。都市中小有產者。日益加速其崩潰之過程都市亦日益衰敗於是而形成爲市塲萎縮。貿易激减。資本主義挾其豐盈之資本鉅量之產品捨「失業」而外。竟無處可以投擲。資本失業。生產過剩於是而减縮工資裁减工人。小企業倒閉。大企業緊縮。於是而失業之工人乃日益激增要求麵包之喊聲。日益響喨。而資本主義之命運。乃日即於黯淡</p>
<p>在一九三一年恐慌之黑潮中。資本主義之台柱如胡佛固亦曾竭力以求挽救其不可挽救之浩刦。其連環緩付戰債計劃之提出。即爲其掙扎撑持之一端。然而戰債緩付之結果。不僅未能挽回已逝之繁榮。反之。且不啻恰爲資本主義之一道催命符。在深刻化之恐慌狂潮中。英國瑞曲挪威相率而停止金本位。日本亦因而實行金再禁。抑且由於經濟上之恐慌。進而激成政治上之動盪。德國國粹黨之抬頭。英國混合内閣之組織。日本政友會之重新登台。皆爲十分顯明之事實。一方蔽之。窮促之環境。已迫使資本主義。陷於崩潰之途程上。而不得不發出無可奈何之呼聲。同時遂使中行報告書中不得不有「市面銷沉·生產過剩·失業激增·金融恐慌·如大火燃燒愈救愈烈」之結論。　　資本主義爲掙扎其最後之殘喘其唯一方法。即爲市塲再分割。與加重殖民地次殖民地之榨壓。當資本主義國家感覺其所處之天地過於狹隘之際。中國尙有未顯明瓜分之廣大市塲與處女地。自爲列强共同注目。中國即迅速成爲各種予盾之擁抱者。而同時由於中國民族資本主義經濟受桎梏於列强而不得發展。故亦無由形成一强有力之政治中樞。列强各以其利害開係。在中國尋覓其利用之工具。并相互明爭暗鬥。而同時中國之軍閥政客。亦各以其利害關係。而尋	覓依以生存靠山以互相爭逐。此爲中國之所以長此分崩離析。政治之所以長此混亂。工商業之所以長此凋敝。以至凡百事業之所以不振之根因。而此種因果關係。在今年則尤爲顯明。</p>

        <h1>1932.03.21</h1>
<h3 id="e1">Reading the China Bank's 20th Annual Report (Part 2) by Bin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>After we grasp the premise that capitalism is entering its third phase, with its panic and turmoil differing from the post-war period in nature and becoming an incurable chronic disease, we can understand that the China Bank's report's assertion that "In the 20th year of the Republic, the global economic situation, after last year's decline, has not only shown no signs of recovery but has instead deteriorated further" is a natural phenomenon. It is not just the 20th year; perhaps there will never be a day of prosperity and revival.</p>
<p>On one hand, capitalism is striving to seek profits in the market; on the other hand, it demands that the purchasing power of the masses increase daily. However, the fact is that when the general population is trapped in extreme poverty and misery, their purchasing power decreases to the lowest limit. Therefore, although the warehouses of capitalism are filled with all kinds of industrial products, inflated to an unbearable extent, the starving and freezing people still have no ability to even take a look. Thus, due to the decline of agriculture, the purchasing power of rural areas is decreasing daily. Small property owners in cities are accelerating their collapse, and cities are also declining daily, thus forming a shrinking market and drastically reduced trade. Capitalism, with its abundant capital and massive products, has nowhere to throw them except "unemployment." Capital is unemployed, and production is surplus, leading to reduced wages and layoffs. Small businesses go bankrupt, and large enterprises shrink. Thus, the number of unemployed workers is increasing daily, and the cries for bread are growing louder. The fate of capitalism is approaching darkness.</p>
<p>In the black tide of the 1931 panic, pillars of capitalism like Hoover also tried their best to salvage the unsalvageable catastrophe. The proposal of his debt moratorium plan was one aspect of his struggle to hold on. However, the result of the debt moratorium not only failed to restore the lost prosperity but, on the contrary, was like a death warrant for capitalism. In the deepening panic, Britain, Sweden, and Norway successively suspended the gold standard, and Japan also implemented a gold embargo. Moreover, due to economic panic, it further triggered political unrest. The rise of the German National Socialist Party, the organization of the British coalition cabinet, and the re-emergence of the Japanese Seiyukai party are all very obvious facts. On the one hand, the impoverished environment has forced capitalism to embark on the path of collapse and has had to issue a helpless cry. At the same time, the China Bank's report had to conclude: "Market depression, overproduction, increased unemployment, and financial panic are like a raging fire, becoming more intense the more one tries to extinguish it."</p>
<p>The only way for capitalism to struggle for its last breath is to re-divide the market and intensify the exploitation of colonies and semi-colonies. When capitalist countries feel that the world they are in is too narrow, China still has a vast market and virgin land that have not been clearly divided, which naturally attracts the common attention of the powers. China quickly became the embracer of various contradictions. At the same time, because China's national capitalist economy is shackled by the powers and cannot develop, it also has no way to form a strong political center. The powers each seek tools for their use in China based on their own interests and engage in overt and covert struggles with each other. At the same time, China's warlords and politicians also seek mountains to rely on for their survival based on their own interests and compete with each other. This is the root cause of China's long-term division and disintegration, the long-term chaos in politics, the long-term decline in industry and commerce, and the lack of vitality in all undertakings. This causal relationship is even more obvious this year.</p>

Our journalists who requested to participate were also rejected.</p>

<h3 id="e9">The United Association of National Salvation Organizations Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Liu Liumin Reports on Meeting with Guo Taiqi</p>
<p>Resolved to Telegraph Opposition to the Treaty of National Humiliation</p>
<p>According to the Riri News, the United Association of National Salvation Organizations of various Shanghai groups convened an emergency board meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss how to deal with the Shanghai diplomatic issue, given the recent tense diplomatic situation. More than 50 representatives from various groups attended. After Chairman Chu Fucheng opened the meeting, representative Liu Liumin first reported on his meeting with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi yesterday morning to inquire about the inside story of the diplomacy and present the advantages and disadvantages. He said that he and Ding Jin, Zhou Xuechao, Wang Hanliang, Cao Yucai, Shen Junru, and other six representatives visited Guo Taiqi twice the day before, but were unable to meet him. At 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the six representatives rushed to Guo's residence and were received. The three immediately asked about the ceasefire and troop withdrawal issues, asking and answering as follows: (Question) Does yesterday's peace conference violate the statement made by our country's representative Yan in Geneva that no negotiations will begin before the Japanese troops withdraw from Chinese territory? (Answer) This peace conference does not contain political nature and does not violate the statement of Representative Yan, because the so-called any negotiations by Representative Yan refers to negotiations with political nature. (Question) Mr. Guo has repeatedly represented the National Government and declared to China and foreign countries, firmly advocating unconditional troop withdrawal. Since he advocated unconditional, why hold a meeting? (Answer) Conditions refer to those with political nature. Yesterday's meeting was to resolve the issue of troop withdrawal. (Question) Is the method of ceasefire and troop withdrawal published in today's Shen Bao true? (Answer) Yes. (Question) The first point of the ceasefire and troop withdrawal method states that the Chinese troops will be stationed in their current positions pending future resolution. Does the so-called future resolution mean resolution by the Sino-Japanese conference? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Then how will the politics of the area where the Japanese army withdraws be maintained now? (Answer) By the Chinese police. (Question) Is the command and supervision of the Chinese police exercised by China? (Answer) It is exercised by China. China originally requested to use a security team, but Japan was very afraid. (Question) There is a neutral zone set up outside, and the public security is maintained by the Chinese police, but the actual police power is controlled by foreigners, is that true? (Answer) Believe the rumors if you want to believe the rumors. (Question) According to the Boxer Protocol, Chinese troops are not allowed to be stationed within twenty hours of Tianjin's urban area, and the Chinese security team maintains order. May I ask Mr. Guo, is this kind of treaty of course a treaty of political nature? (Tacitly admitted) (Question) Now the area where the Japanese army withdraws is not allowed to enter until the so-called political conference is held between China and Japan. This is obviously restricting China's sovereignty and is no different from the point in the Boxer Protocol that no troops are allowed to be stationed within twenty miles of Tianjin. Why does Mr. Guo say that yesterday's troop withdrawal conference has no political nature? (Answer) This is temporary. (Question) Even if it is temporary, is it temporary with political nature? Mr. Guo did not answer, and finally could not get the point. Finally, he declared that the association insisted that Vice Minister Guo pay attention to two points: (1) No negotiations will be held after the Japanese army withdraws from Chinese territory. (2) Shanghai and the Northeast are one issue and cannot be resolved locally.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Matters Resolved <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>After the report was completed, the representatives discussed how to deal with the diplomatic issues and resolved the following important cases: (1) Place advertisements opposing the humiliating conditions. (2) Telegraph the whole country, advocating opposition to starting any negotiations before the Japanese troops withdraw. (Original telegram recorded on the right) (3) Telegraph the League of Nations, the United States, and the investigation team, absolutely not recognizing the signing of the humiliating treaty. (4) Warn the diplomatic authorities. (5) Request various groups to strike, boycott, and march to show opposition. (6) Request the media to unanimously advocate</p>
<h3 id="e11">Telegraph to the Whole Country <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the so-called peace talks, this association has stipulated three principles by the general assembly on March 19 and announced them on file. The method of ceasefire and troop withdrawal agreed this time, to its lowest limit, should be in accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations' repeated resolutions and the attitude of our government's repeated declarations that Japan will not withdraw its troops and will not negotiate. However, recently our Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi, surrounded by strong enemies, has already begun negotiations with the Japanese side. The content includes restricting the location of our military's defense, the Japanese army is still allowed to be stationed in the contiguous section outside the concession, and a joint Sino-Japanese committee will be formed, together with representatives from neutral countries to monitor the withdrawal of troops and maintain security in the troop withdrawal area. The area where the Japanese troops are withdrawing has virtually lost its sovereignty. What Japan could not obtain from the League of Nations has now been obtained from the Shanghai troop withdrawal conference. This kind of humiliating diplomacy will not be recognized by this association. If the government is willing to sign this condition, all groups in this association will take effective measures to show the determination of the people. May our compatriots all over the country rise up and plan for it together.</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Japanese Side's Attitude is Tough on the Ceasefire Agreement <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Decision of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Record of the Mainichi Shimbun</p>
<p>Tokyo Electric News of the Japanese Union Agency on the 20th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received the report from Minister Shigemitsu on the ceasefire conference in Shanghai and the request for instructions on the agreement case last night. Foreign Minister Yoshizawa summoned Vice Minister Nagai, Asia Bureau Director Tani, Information Minister Shirani, etc. today to discuss the results and decided to approve all except the second item. The second item did not have the phrase "Japanese army withdraws to the Shanghai-Wusong line" advocated by Japan, but only stipulated "withdraws to the concession and the area near the concession," and stipulated that "the withdrawal location shall be specified by the Japanese army, but in case of any questions, foreign military officers shall assist in mediation." This kind of regulation is indeed to recognize the participation of third countries in the negotiations, and the Japanese side resolutely refuses. This decision firmly adheres to the original Japanese plan. Yoshizawa's reply will be sent to Shigemitsu tonight or tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>The Japanese Mainichi Shimbun stated that according to the results of the third meeting between Minister Shigemitsu and Guo Taiqi at 4:00 PM on the 19th to negotiate the ceasefire, the Japanese side believed that the unconditional withdrawal of Japanese troops proposed by the Chinese side was too ambiguous and could not be recognized. Later, with the mediation of British Minister Lampson, it was decided that the general outline of the ceasefire agreement was as follows: (1) The Chinese army is stationed in its current position, and the Japanese army retreats into the public concession, Hongkou, and the roads outside the concession in the Hongkou area. (2) However, the Japanese army needs to build barracks in Wusong. (3) Organize a joint commission of neutral countries to monitor the withdrawal of troops. (4) The Chinese side will automatically ease the anti-Japanese issue and recognize Mayor Wu's reply to Consul Murai on January 28. Agreement will be held based on the above outline as its foundation, a mixed commission will be organized, and then the details will be discussed. The preliminary meeting has now been concluded, and both sides are asking the government to approve the above outline.</p>
<h3 id="e13">A Large Number of Japanese Troops Arrived Again Yesterday <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>More than 4,000 Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>Fifty Military Vehicles</p>
<p>The Japanese army is using the opportunity of the ceasefire to promote an atmosphere of peace on the one hand, and actively deploy military affairs on the other. It is estimated that from the 8th of this month to yesterday, within these two weeks, more than 30 Japanese army transport merchant ships and warships carrying soldiers have arrived in Wusong and Shanghai one after another. The number of Japanese troops transported has been around two divisions. There were continued arrivals yesterday, as detailed below:</p>
<p>Army: At 9:00 AM yesterday, a Japanese military transport ship named Urajia Mlaru, carrying the army, arrived in Shanghai from Japan. At 1:30 PM, another troop transport ship named Taishan Maru also arrived in Shanghai from Japan. The two ships carried more than 4,000 soldiers and a large amount of ammunition. Therefore, the 13th and 15th destroyer squadrons were sent to escort them along the way. After entering the port, they landed in the Wusong area and were reportedly sent to various places in the front.</p>
<p>Military Vehicles: Because the battle line has moved to the west of Shanghai, the transportation of troops, food, ammunition, etc. by the Japanese Ministry of the Army is more difficult. Therefore, 50 military trucks were specially shipped from Japan to Shanghai. They have been loaded and landed at the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu and have been sent to the front for application.</p>
<p>Military Food: The food required by the Japanese army is purchased and transported from places such as Dalian and the Yangtze River. Rice is purchased in Shanghai. The food applied by soldiers stationed in Liuhuo and other places is transported by Changyang No. 9 and sent to the mouth of the Yangtze River to load rice purchased from various places on the Yangtze River to supply the troops stationed in various places.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Collection of Frontline Intelligence <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Special telegram from Changshu on the 20th: The enemy has placed more than ten field guns in Xijing and five or six in Xintang City, all with their muzzles pointed towards Taicang.</p>
<p>They are also setting up straw men in the Xijing area to lure us. There were no battles before the 20th. At the moment, a Japanese plane is scouting in the urban area. Chang'an, Suxi, and other ships have newly opened shifts. Japanese warships have withdrawn from the mouths of Liuhuo and Xijing, and the marines have not yet moved.</p>
<p>Special telegram from Suzhou on the 20th: A Japanese plane scouted the Suzhou-Chang area. There were no battles in Liuhuo on the 20th, but more than 500 enemy troops set up straw men between Liuhuo and Xijing, which was discovered by our army. There were five or six mountain howitzers in Xintang City, with their muzzles pointed towards Taicang. The enemy has set up a gun array south of Xijing. Gong Youshan, an enemy spy, was captured at Suzhou Station on the 20th, hiding three dice without spots. American Counselor Weimen visited Suzhou on the 12th and has been observing the front every day, gaining the most detailed information. On the 20th, he saw a newspaper report that artillery fire was heard in Taicang on the 19th, so he went to the front for investigation again. On the way, he replied to reporters that he must continue the investigation because he did not receive an order from the minister to leave Suzhou. Six traitors were executed in Kunshan on the 20th.</p>
<p>Suzhou Electric News on the 20th from the New Voice: (1) On the 18th and 19th, about 1,000 reinforcements arrived at the Japanese front line around Zhujiaqiao and Hongqiao. They are now constructing defensive works, working day and night, and actively preparing for war. A large number of military equipment and food have been transported from Shanghai. Many cannons are placed behind the infantry line, and the gun covers have been removed. The situation is quite tense. (2) At 8:05 AM on the 19th, a Japanese plane came to scout Suzhou, flying quite low, and did not fly to Kunshan until half an hour later.</p>
<p>Suzhou Electric News on the 20th from the New Voice: The Japanese army is doing its best to rush to build fortifications in the Liutang and Liuliqiao areas. It was reported on the 20th that the Japanese army in Liutang had increased by 500. Thirty Japanese aircraft in the front line transported them to Zhenru, and more than 20 tanks were dispatched to the front. The Japanese army is busy transferring and replenishing, and is actively preparing for war.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Japanese Planes Soaring Overhead Yesterday <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM yesterday, a white Japanese plane was soaring over the British Concession, Xinzha Road, Avenue Edward VII, Guling Road, Meibai Road, Xin Bridge, Xinzha Bridge, Niaozhen Road Bridge, Xin Garbage Bridge, and Beini Bridge. It did not leave until around 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>At 12:00 PM yesterday, a Japanese plane took off from the north and flew along the Huangpu River to Nanshi. It flew very high and circled the city walls once before heading west. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, two Japanese planes flew and scouted from the Gaochang Temple area, then flew along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road towards Xinzhuang.</p>

<p>Claiming They Won't Drop Bombs if China Doesn't Shoot</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, Japanese planes have been going to scout in recent days. After our authorities repeatedly protested, the Japanese consul reportedly replied, roughly saying that during the peace conference, before the Japanese troops withdraw, it is still necessary to observe the military work. If your army does not shoot with anti-aircraft guns, we will never drop bombs. Therefore, the Zhejiang Provincial authorities issued a notice to the people, urging them not to frighten themselves and gather crowds to watch, causing rumors and panic among the people, and asking them to live and work in peace.</p>

<p>Defending the Speech of McKean</p>
<p>Because the Shanghai Harmony Chamber of Commerce held its 84th annual meeting on the 15th of this month, the new chairman McKean said in his speech that the Chinese authorities failed to curb the anti-Japanese activities, and the current Sino-Japanese dispute was caused by this. Obscuring the truth and confusing international audiences, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Harmony Chamber of Commerce yesterday, based on the facts, defending the inappropriateness of what the chairman said in order to clarify right and wrong.</p>

<p>Requesting Protest</p>
<p>The Commercial Press, the only cultural institution in our country, was bombed and destroyed by the Japanese army. The Book Industry Association has reported it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting to lodge a protest with Japan and reserve the request for compensation for losses. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Representative Yan to inform the League of Nations. Now, the association has received the list of losses sent by the Commercial Press and has submitted it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again. The report states that the Commercial Press, a member of the association, was bombed and destroyed by the Japanese army. The total loss is more than 16 million yuan. The buildings and machinery are listed at the original purchase value. The construction costs and international exchange rates are now twice as high. Now, to revive it, more than 16 million yuan is not enough. Rare books and other items cannot be obtained with money. The cultural loss is lamentable. Therefore, the list of losses of the Commercial Press is recorded and submitted, requesting a serious protest to Japan and declaring that the request for compensation for losses is reserved.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places have become war zones. Residents of the city and Pudong have also moved to avoid the war. Various shops in the Public Concession, the French Concession, etc. have boycotted the market to resist aggression, and all industries have been suspended. More than 60 groups, including the Shanghai Citizens' United Association, have resolved to organize a rent reduction and exemption movement committee after a representative meeting regarding the rent issue after the war. It is heard that the Real Estate Association will discuss the rent collection methods in the war zone and its vicinity at 2:00 PM on March 28.</p>

<p>Various shops in Nanshi, such as the ginseng and medicine industry, the cured meat industry, the fruit and ground goods industry, the clothing industry, and the tobacco industry, have suspended business since the war broke out in Zhabei on January 28, affecting the city and suburbs of Nanshi. It has been nearly two months since then, and the losses have been quite large. The situation has eased slightly in recent days. Yesterday, the industry associations of various industries initiated a large rent reduction movement. After some negotiations, they all unanimously agreed that the goal of rent reduction is to pay no more than half of the rent. The Nanshi Tenants' Union Office has been established in the dry tobacco association in Dong Yaojia Lane in the city. Yesterday, 2,600 households have been distributed to various shops to stamp their seals. After the collection is completed, a representative meeting will be convened to discuss the implementation plan and submit it to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and other agencies for assistance. In addition, the Shanghai Road Business Association and the Gan District Branch of the Citizens' United Association believe that the shops have difficulty bearing the rent during the boycott period. Yesterday, they drafted opinions: (1) During the boycott period, shops that are completely closed should be completely exempt from rent. (2) During the boycott period, shops that are still able to make a living should have their rent reduced by half. (3) Once the market recovers, the original amount will still be paid.</p>

<p>Pastor Jiang and His Family Missing</p>
<h3 id="e24">No News Yet <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that Pastor Jiang of the Jesus Church at 17 Binle'an Road, along with his family and servants, a total of seven people, disappeared on January 29th. Although Fei Wusheng of the YMCA and other relatives and friends tried their best to find them, no trace has been found so far. It is said that Pastor Jiang and others were arrested by the Japanese naval landing force when they went to search for plainclothes teams. Therefore, his friends have repeatedly corresponded with the Japanese authorities, but the Japanese authorities admitted that the landing force had entered the church and the pastor's residence to search for plainclothes teams, but denied arresting the entire Jiang family. On February 13th, four members of the church's management committee jointly sent a public letter to Japanese Navy Commander-in-Chief Nomura, reporting the matter and requesting an investigation and release (the details have been recorded in previous reports). Later, on February 19th, a reply letter was received from the Japanese Consul-General's Office, but only admitted that landing force soldiers entered the church to search for plainclothes teams, and denied all other details of the assault and arrest. Fei Wusheng wrote to Japanese Consul-General Murai twice on February 2nd and 24th, requesting him to find a way to release them as soon as possible. Fei's letter stated a fact, saying that the elementary school run downstairs in the church had ordered students to sing anti-Japanese songs, but Pastor Jiang protested to the school authorities because it was inconsistent with Christian doctrine. Because the school and the church were independent of each other and not subordinate to each other, it was ineffective. Later, Consul-General Murai replied on the 29th, also admitting that 20 landing force soldiers led by an officer entered the pastor's residence. Now there is a church member named Mao Wenlin (transliteration) who has made a certificate stating that he witnessed about 50 landing force soldiers enter the church to search. Because the door was opened late, they moved _ the pastor, assaulted him, and arrested his entire family. Only one girl was not arrested because she was not in the pastor's residence.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Difficulty in Collecting Two Months' Rent <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, due to the provincial treasury's shortage, levied two months' rent from the entire province to meet urgent needs. The Shanghai County Government has received the provincial order to comply. However, local people in the county, upon hearing this news, all believe that since the Sino-Japanese war has broken out, although the county has not been _ damaged, the impact is very significant. Many civilians in the countryside are in danger of running out of food. Moreover, the county's jurisdiction is mostly poor, and most of the houses are dilapidated and flat. Even if collected, the amount is very small. People are waiting for rescue and have no spare capacity to pay. Therefore, they have requested the county government to forward the request for exemption to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>

Later, _ will clear the salary to show preferential treatment. It is said that this regulation treats all officers and soldiers equally, so all wounded soldiers are very gratified.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Wusong Town Turned into a Rubble Field <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Only one out of a hundred houses in the entire town remain</p>
<p>Cavalry gallops, residents scattered</p>
<p>The Far Eastern News Agency reported that Wusong Town, adjacent to the fort and at the mouth of the sea, is strategically important. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, our 19th Route Army sent elite troops to defend along the river. From February 25th to the 3rd of this month, the enemy concentrated the strength of its naval, land, and air forces to fiercely bomb and attack _ for eight days, destroying all the houses in the town. Although the war has ended, the true situation of the area is still unclear. The reporter of the Liaodong News Agency, specially ventured to go there yesterday (20th) to record the actual observations, divided as follows:</p>
<p>The reporter can reach Songjiang by both land and water, but the land road is full of Japanese soldiers, and there are many obstacles. He decided to follow the waterway and went to the Bund in the early morning to board a small steamer and headed straight for Wusong. At that time, the red sun was rising, and the gentle breeze was blowing. Walking on the side of the boat, he still felt the chill of spring. The boat passed the Waibaidu Bridge and saw the "Izumo" warship still docked in front of the Japanese Consulate, densely covered with electric nets, and the defense seemed very strict. There were two transport ships, "Aso Maru" and others, at the Huishan Wharf, and military supplies were piled up on the shore. Japanese soldiers were busy carrying them. The 9th Division's brigade was stationed on the open space east of the Zhanghuabang Dredging Bureau. Japanese military camps stood tall, and soldiers were lying on the ground, basking in the sun. After an hour and ten minutes of sailing, the boat arrived at Songjiang Town. The small steamer berthed at the _ dock. Two Japanese military police were stationed on the shore. When the reporter landed, they blocked the road and searched him all over. Fortunately, the language _ was different, and they looked at each other inarticulate, and were released. Fortunately, they were not detained for too long.</p>
<p>Before the reporter arrived in Songjiang, he thought that at most 70% or 80% of the houses in Songjiang Town were burned and completely destroyed. Unexpectedly, it was far from the truth. Not even one out of a hundred shops and residences in the entire town were intact. Looking around, all that could be seen were collapsed walls and broken bricks, which had become a field of rubble. Along the riverside Waima Road, dangerous walls and broken pillars stood tall. From east to west, more than a thousand houses were completely destroyed. Even the embankment was covered with bullet marks and mostly collapsed. Among them, such as the 7th District Public Security Bureau, Fire Brigade, Public Works Bureau, and Shipping Office, none were spared. Only the Lifesaving Bureau was relatively low in position, and the roof was hit by shells in four or five places. The bricks and tiles were messy, but it still stood tall. Behind the house, a small courtyard had been bombed by a plane into a huge pond about ten feet deep and four or five feet wide, with green water gurgling, no less than a small pool.</p>
<p>Iron cavalry galloped on Waima Road, back and forth, and the baggage trains were endless. Every ten minutes, a large team of Japanese soldiers would pass in formation, coming and going, extremely busy. Many Japanese expatriate students also took trucks to the town, talking and gesturing, full of vigor. There were also quite a few foreigners who came here, but the Japanese soldiers were very strict in the search, and if they could not communicate, they would be stopped. The reporter witnessed two Westerners bringing two women, negotiating for half an hour, but they were not allowed to enter and returned on the original boat. Songxing Road was the essence of the town, with prosperous shops. Larger shops were opened here. The entire road was completely destroyed from west to east. The reporter traveled all over the road and only saw five houses, such as Dachang Silk Shop, Yukangzhuang, Shengshengtang Pharmacy, St. John's Church, Yue Ruo Saint Church Elementary School, and the Post Office, that had not collapsed. However, the interior had been looted, and the four walls were empty, with nothing left. The streets were full of rubble, and it was difficult to walk. Occasionally, two or three poor people were searching for scraps in the rubble. They had white cloth wrapped around their arms, with a small red circle in the middle, or replaced with small flowers.</p>
<p>The walls in the streets were covered with red and green Japanese military notices, without a title, only the three words "Japanese Army" were written below. There were three or four kinds of such notices, and they were everywhere in the streets and alleys. The slogans written on the walls by the Weng Brigade of the 19th Route Army before the retreat were also interesting.</p>
<p>At the twenty-first place in the western part of Songjiang Road, there was a thin coffin lying in the middle of the road. The person in the coffin was Zhou Xiuzhen, a local civilian patrolman, and her two sons. During the fierce battle, her house was suddenly hit by a shell, and the _ collapsed, and the woman and her two sons were crushed to death at the same time. The bodies had been lying there for more than ten days. The woman's youngest son was still _ for a long time, and his hands and arms were full of dog's bellies. Neighbors couldn't bear it, and yesterday they put the two bodies and the baby's two feet into a coffin together. Mother and son died together, which is also regrettable.</p>
<p>The houses on Dongsheng Road have also completely collapsed. Pedestrians walked over the roofs, passing through the rooms, as if there was no one there. At the open space at No. 35, a shell hit and bombed a small pool. There was still a dead body next to the pool, the skin color had changed, and no one had coffined it.</p>
<p>There was a pawnshop in Zhongxin Road, with dangerous walls standing around. The exterior seemed intact, but the roof inside was gone, and there were no objects, only an empty shell. The Hongyuan Road Supervisory Council Church has also collapsed into the rubble, and there is still a corpse of our soldier. The bullet hit his chest, causing his death, and the blood stains his eyes.</p>
<p>At No. 27 Nanchang Road, there was a large cannonball about four feet long that penetrated the house and had not exploded. A hand grenade on a table in a certain surname's house, and small cannonballs all over the doorway, which could be picked up easily. According to residents, there were more bullets and corpses near the fort. Unfortunately, the Japanese army did not allow pedestrians to pass around the fort, so they could not go there.</p>
<p>The Songjiang Railway Station is farther away from the river, and the front is shaded by tall trees, so it has not been shelled. The medical college of the Central University opposite has many bullet holes, as dense as a honeycomb. The stars are even more numerous. The Chinese Public School has been completely destroyed. The school buildings of Tongji University are better preserved. The German flag is hung on the roof. It is said that German teachers have returned to the school and are supervising the work.</p>
<p>The Beishi River Road area was less affected by the disaster. The rear part of the second and third houses in Guihua Lane was not destroyed. Seven or eight houses built by the Zhang family in Tongchun Road were still intact because they were more remote. These are the only survivors in the city. The rest have all become ruins, the smoke has been cut off for a long time, and there are no pedestrians on the road. Being in it is extremely sad.</p>
<p>The biggest losses in the entire town's shops were the Wusong Noodle Factory behind Zhongxin Road _ and the Wansheng Sauce _ on Songxing Road. Wansheng has many branches and hundreds of jars of stored sauce _. So far, there is no residue, and the loss is more than tens of thousands.</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of Japanese soldiers in Wusong Town, using the public sports field as a base. Others go back and forth between Yangshupu and Yangxing. There are thousands of Japanese halo not far from the town in places such as Sixty _ and Lijiazhai. According to residents who fled from Yangxing, the residents of Yangxing Town fled because of unbearable harassment, leaving only the old men and old women.</p>
<p>Touring the entire town for a week took more than two hours. Because the reporter was wearing a suit, he was noticed by the Japanese soldiers, who glared at him and looked ferocious. Knowing that it was difficult to stay any longer, he hurried to the shortcut and returned to the boat. When the reporter returned to Shanghai, there was a Japanese warship No. 26 exiting from the mouth of the Huangpu River. In less than five minutes, there was another cruiser No. 13 entering the port. The soldiers on the warship and the _ cavalry patrol on the shore waved their towels and cheered, with an arrogant demeanor. It was already 2:30 in the afternoon when they set sail back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Comfort and Relief</p>
<h3 id="e28">Donating Money and Clothes is Still Unremitting <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Shandong Overseas Chinese _ Temporary Association for Donating Money to Save the Country donated 402 yuan, which was handed over to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for transfer, to provide comfort. Ms. Zhou Shen Baode donated 100 sets of shirts and pants.</p>

<p>Remember to send fruits, milk, eggs, biscuits, cigarettes, etc., to No. 4, Yidingpan Road. Benevolent people from all walks of life who can donate are requested to send them directly to the hospital. The wounded soldiers will be very grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Huangjiu Industry's Thrifty Meal Donation <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The China Jiji _ Life Association in this port recently received a letter from Zhu Gong Jinkang, a pioneer in the Huangjiu industry, to commemorate the old Daqing Yong and Zhenkang Zhuang's commemorative year, stating that Zhu Gong Jinkang, a pioneer in the Huangjiu industry, was enthusiastic about serving the public welfare of the industry during his lifetime. After his death, fellow traders held a commemorative dinner at the Wine Industry Association every year on March 24. Now that the country is in trouble, thinking of the displaced victims in the war zone is truly pitiful. In addition to still offering incense at the Public Assembly Hall at that time as a memorial, all the expenses for the Qingyin dinner, etc., totaling 100 yuan, are donated to the Jiji Life Association to supplement the war zone refugee reception fees. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is a fellow countryman's obligation. In addition to sending a letter of thanks from the association and allocating this amount to the refugee reception center run by the association for relief, the Huangjiu fellow traders are considerate of the victims and generously donate the money for the commemorative meal of the pioneer Zhu Gong Jinkang to relief, and their enthusiasm for charity is extremely commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Delong Tobacco Factory's Enthusiastic Burial <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Wang Weiguan, manager of Delong Tobacco Company, initiated and organized a burial team, recognizing thousands of coffins, purchasing two trucks, and entrusting the Jiangwan Chongshan Hall Charity Association with the War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association to handle the burial work. Since March 8, 439 soldiers' and civilians' bodies have been collected so far. Hundreds of other bodies are scattered everywhere, and the work is extremely difficult. Starting on the 20th, Delong Tobacco Company will also borrow No. 18 Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, as a temporary office for Chongshan Hall.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Red Cross Refugee Reception Center Letter <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage, witnessed the tragic situation of displaced refugees and established the Second Refugee Reception Center of the Chinese Red Cross Tianchan Stage to receive refugees from Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong. In addition to successively hiring ferries to send five or six thousand people back to their hometowns in Jiangbei, there are still two thousand seven or eight hundred refugees in the theater. They are provided with two meals of rice porridge and five steamed buns a day. For the sake of the health of the refugees, a monthly hygiene unit is set up to hire Chinese and Western doctors to treat the refugees. All expenses of the center are borne by Mr. Gu alone. It is now heard that refugees from various places are still crowding in to request reception, and most of them are unwilling to be sent away from Shanghai due to livelihood problems. I am afraid that it will be difficult to continue for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Baolong Hospital Received Donations <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Baolong Hospital on Baker Road in this port has been very enthusiastic about rescuing wounded soldiers and injured refugees this time. However, it is heard that the hospital's funds are not sufficient, so it is very hopeful that all sectors will provide financial and material assistance. The hospital has received donations from Chinese and Western sectors, which have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the hospital has recently received unsolicited donations from various parties as follows: Women's Assistance to Wounded Soldiers, 100 yuan; Mrs. Liang Wangqiu, 200 yuan; Aunt Luo, 50 yuan and 10 yuan; Aunt Chen, 5 yuan; Mrs. Liang Chen, 50 yuan; Mrs. Li, 20 yuan; Mr. K.C.

<p>The Fujian Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, at the intersection of Simalu and Yunnan Road, is providing relief to fellow townsmen in Shanghai who are struggling. Anyone who is homeless and unemployed in Shanghai and urgently wants to return to their hometown, after being certified by fellow townsmen as being from Fujian, can go to the association to register. The association will issue free boat tickets within three days, provide a small amount of travel rations, and send them back to their province.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Guangdong Refugees Have Safely Arrived in Their Hometowns <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Guangdong Fellow Townsmen Relief Association specially hired the Hua Wu steamship to send the affected fellow townsmen back to Guangdong, loaded with more than six thousand people, which departed at 1:00 PM on the 24th of last month. When leaving the mouth of Wusong, the Japanese warships took this opportunity to continuously fire cannons and machine guns at our Wusong fort. Fortunately, the defending soldiers of our fort deeply understood righteousness and protected their compatriots and did not fight back, so they could safely exit the port. When it arrived at the mouth of Fuzhou on the 27th, a hurricane suddenly struck for more than 30 hours, causing a ship car leaf to be destroyed and drifted more than a hundred miles with the wind, almost in distress. On the 1st of this month, it arrived at Huangpu at noon. A total of more than 300 people sought medical treatment during the journey due to illness, such as coughs. When they arrived in Guangzhou, no adults died, and four children died due to _ measles. Four babies were also born, and the number of deaths and births was equal, which can be said to be strange. When the ship arrived at Huangpu, dozens of people, including directors of the Fangbian Hospital and colleagues from the Daxin Company, were on site to take care of them. At that time, there were many people and a lot of luggage, and it was quite difficult to cope with. Fortunately, the Fangbian Hospital had borrowed dozens of small fireboats and large rural ferry willow boats in advance to tow and barge the refugees across the river. These boats were all enthusiastically dedicated by the boat owners. Huangpu is quite far from the Tianzi Wharf, and the refugees were tired after many days, and it was very inconvenient to walk with the elderly and children. Fortunately, various long-distance bus companies dedicated buses, and the Daxin Company dedicated private cars and trucks to transport the refugees. In addition to those who went to the countryside after landing, more than two thousand people stayed in the Fangbian Hospital. The refugees who returned to Heilongjiang were approved by the Fangbian Hospital to be granted free travel by the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Yuehan Railways, the Municipal Merchant Shipping Association, the Provincial-Hong Kong Tong'an Steamship Company, the Provincial-Macau Tong'an Steamship Company, the Macau Government _, and long-distance bus companies, regardless of whether they took a bus, boat, or ferry. The Public Security Bureau dispatched security team members _ and detectives to maintain order. The Social Bureau sent personnel to guide. The Navy Department sent boats to transport the Second Army, and the Huangpu Military Academy sent personnel to take care of and deliver porridge. The enthusiasm of the various other agencies, social organizations, and business circles, who either supplied boats and cars, or sent people to take care of them, or donated cash, _ and delivered food, was truly admirable. According to statistics, the association has sent a total of more than ten thousand people in several shipments, all of whom landed safely, without losing people or luggage. The refugees were all very happy.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Mr. Xu Jingren spoke to the reporter, "Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Executive Yuan had requested to commend me for handling the relief of refugees. I have not heard of it. This Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association was jointly initiated and organized by people from various charitable and public welfare organizations in this port. I am only one of the participants, following their lead and assisting in the handling. I believe that handling relief work is only to do what is right in one's heart, and I am seeking to avoid mistakes. How dare I ask for commendation?"</p>
<h3 id="e39">Wu Lien-teh Discusses Wartime Hygiene and Disease Prevention <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>During the fierce thirty-four-day battle in Shanghai between our country's 19th Route Army and the Japanese naval, land, and air forces, there were indeed areas for improvement in the hygiene of military police and troops, to prepare for future wartime use. We feel that there is unlimited awareness of this and that it is a matter of urgency. Wartime hygiene cannot be fully discussed in a short piece of writing. This is merely a brief description of the key points, based on the experience gained from this short, fierce battle. Looking at advanced countries, although military doctors are part of the military, their main work is parallel to that of the regular army. The duty of military medical officers is to protect the lives of the entire army, preventing disease before it occurs and providing emergency treatment. This can both increase the combat capability of the army and reduce the difficulty of transporting the sick and wounded to the rear. Because wartime hygiene is so important, the duties of military medical officers are not limited to treating the sick and wounded. The hygiene and disease prevention in the camps, and the daily life, diet, and drinking water of the soldiers, should all be fundamentally researched in advance to avoid digging a well only when thirsty. The prevention of various acute and chronic infectious diseases such as malaria, dysentery, and typhoid is also important. For the sake of brevity, only a few essential points are listed below for those concerned to consider: (1) Military Food and Clothing. According to years of research and experience, the main foods for the army should be rich in protein, fat, carbohydrates, and salts. The consideration of calories and vitamins should not be neglected. As for clothing, attention should be paid to wearing appropriate clothing. Boots and shoes should allow for free movement and prevent accidental injuries. Protection from rain, snow, and the hot sun is also essential. During the recent Shanghai battle, very few of our country's troops wore leather boots, most wore cloth shoes, and used Guangdong oil paper bamboo woven hats instead of raincoats. Fortunately, it was early spring, and the weather was dry and cold, so there was no major harm. However, many soldiers suffered foot injuries from wading through icy rivers, requiring amputation to save their lives. (2) Drinking Water Supply. In new battle strategies, many extended trenches are built to defend against enemy invasions. The trenches built in this Shanghai battle were about twenty miles long. It is difficult for troops living there for long periods to obtain pure drinking water. If necessary, wells should be drilled to a depth of one hundred to two hundred feet. However, this is often impossible due to the constant advance and retreat of the troops and unexpected circumstances. If the river water is too dirty and is not thoroughly boiled or chemically purified, drinking it will cause intestinal infections such as typhoid and dysentery, and even trigger epidemics of cholera and other diseases. In 1921, the 19th Route Army suffered many deaths from gastrointestinal infections, which is a pity. If preventive measures had been taken and scientific attention paid to drinking water to improve its quality, or if quinine had been taken internally as a preventive measure, this would not have happened. There are two simple ways to prevent gastrointestinal diseases: (A) All drinking water should be disinfected with bleaching powder or chloramine-T to kill water toxins. These powerful and inexpensive drugs can release free chlorine. One part of this gas per million parts of water can completely disinfect the water and make it safe to drink. However, it should be noted that the water quality in Jiangsu Province is too poor, so more chlorine may be needed. Generally, four watts of chloramine-T should be mixed with 100 cc of pure water as a disinfectant. Two drops of this solution should be used for every 1000 cc of dirty water, which is equivalent to four watts of powder being equal to one watt of chlorine gas, enough to disinfect dirty water. When disinfecting dirty water, it is best to have a fixed amount of water cans, calculate the amount of bleaching powder needed, add it, shake it, and transport it to the front line after two or three hours as safe drinking water. In addition to disinfecting drinking water, each soldier should be injected with a typhoid fever vaccine to prevent this disease. This prevention method has been proven to be an unparalleled method after years of battle research. Our country's army should immediately follow this example. Typhoid fever is the most easily transmitted and epidemic disease during wartime. Preventing it in advance can ensure safety. It only requires the officials in charge to understand its benefits and implement it, which is as easy as turning one's hand. Moreover, the Shanghai health authorities have widely used mixed vaccines against typhoid, paratyphoid, and cholera every summer in recent years, which can prevent three kinds of malignant infections at the same time. Although our country is accustomed to drinking boiled water or tea, it is difficult to obtain this convenience during marching, so scientific methods must be used instead. (3) Methods for Preventing Flies, Mosquitoes, and Insects. We all know that flies are vectors for dysentery, typhoid, cholera, and digestive diseases. To eliminate them, the first step is to find ways to destroy fly eggs and pupae to prevent their reproduction. Horse manure and other filth must be removed and burned. Other scattered and wet excrement should be placed in appropriate boxes and burned, or killed with lime or refined sodium and other insecticides. Anopheles mosquitoes, which belong to the genus Anopheles, are vectors of malaria and can transmit malaria to humans. In Jiangxi Province in 1926, countless soldiers were infected with malaria by this type of mosquito. Professional hygienists have good methods for killing mosquito eggs and pupae to stop their reproduction. When troops pass through areas where malaria is prevalent, it is best to give them 5 li of quinine internally every day as a preventive agent. Lice and head lice are often vectors for typhus, which should not be neglected, especially in winter. I once read stories of the suffering caused by this in Russia and Poland during the European war, which are chilling to hear. (4) Methods for Preventing External Injuries. External injuries are vital to the entire army during wartime. Therefore, armies around the world must carry small first-aid kits containing iodine and other emergency medicines in their backpacks. In addition, medicated bandages should be sewn into military uniforms to prevent unexpected needs. Even if an external injury occurs and help is not available, iodine can be applied to the wound, and then bandaged with medicated bandages. Iodine has the function of disinfecting and stopping bleeding, preventing subsequent blood infections. Once the wound is properly bandaged, a stretcher rescue team will come when the front line is relatively relaxed and transport it to the rear or field hospital for radical treatment. During the recent Shanghai battle, countless wounded soldiers were transported to the rear for treatment, and most of the hospitals were in the concessions. The first-aid methods on the front line were not fully implemented. The Red Cross, Red Swastika, and various charitable organizations were dedicated to rescuing wounded soldiers on the front line and transferring them to temporary hospitals for wounded soldiers in the rear. There were various degrees of injuries, but fortunately, there were many talented people and good equipment in the rear. Although there were occasional cases of gas gangrene, tetanus, and blood infections due to prolonged exposure in the fields, most of them were treated effectively. For example, there were cases of purulent infections after head injuries with convulsions, which were eventually completely cured by surgical procedures. It is rare for wounded soldiers to have such resistance to treatment. Fortunately, the Central Epidemic Prevention Department of Beiping had prepared 80 liters (1000 cc per liter) of tetanus antitoxin serum for treatment and prevention of the disease. St. John's University also prepared an immeasurable amount of Dakin's solution (a strong antiseptic solution containing chlorine and salts) to supply wound treatment. All wounded soldiers returning to the hospital are now supplied with a sufficient amount by this university.</p>
<p>Now the Shanghai battle has temporarily stopped, and the loyal and brave soldiers of the 19th Route Army have won praise from the world. Our government should adopt good methods and prepare in advance so that soldiers have such knowledge, and then going to the front line can reduce unexpected sacrifices.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway still ran four express and slow passenger trains each way between Hangzhou and Shanghai yesterday. The number of passengers arriving in Shanghai was still crowded, averaging more than 3,000 people per day. Some of them arrived in Suzhou from the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, then transferred to Jiaxing by steamship, and took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Shanghai. Therefore, the Railway Bureau added a shuttle passenger train each way from Jiaxing to Shanghai to avoid the lack of capacity on the Shanghai-Hangzhou passenger trains. Since the addition of the Shanghai-Jiashan shuttle train, it has been very convenient for passengers traveling short distances, and the Railway Bureau's business has also increased slightly.</p>

<p>Fang Congfu wrote a letter to Mayor Wu Tiecheng, saying: "Respectfully, Mayor Tiecheng, I am writing to you to inform you that I, the victim, have lived at 5 Fengyuan Lane, Xizang Road, Zhabei, for many years. Since the sudden outbreak of the January 28th Incident, I fled in a hurry, without taking any belongings. When I returned home on the 12th of this month, although the house was not destroyed, the boxes, cabinets, clothes chests, wooden furniture, and other furniture were all stolen. The most heartbreaking thing is the two large leather boxes of Song, Yuan, and Ming editions of books. Each book has the seal of 'Qin Shi Caotang.' Also, there is a portrait of my late ancestor, Wan Qiao, and a hanging genealogy, all of which are ancestral legacies and family treasures that I have guarded carefully and dared not lose for half my life, but they have also disappeared. Now, I am presenting a book of posthumous poems, printed with the hall name and the portrait of my late ancestor, to serve as proof. I beg you to order your subordinates to investigate and find the stolen goods from all sources, so that the items can be returned to their original owner and preserved forever. I will be grateful for your great kindness. I respectfully ask for a reply. Sincerely, Fang Congfu, a displaced person from Jiangxi living in Shanghai, March 20th, residing at 3 Yongan Lane, Yongan Street, French Concession."</p>

<h3 id="e48">Summary of Housing Dispute <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The United Business Association of Aivin Road, Daoda and Baoshu Lanes, recently received a petition from more than twenty shops and residents of the Daoda and Baoshu Lanes, including Xiesheng Pawnshop, Rixin Taihao, Laobaohua Silver Shop, Baochi Hospital, Zhenchang Garden, Chenxingji Construction Factory, Ding Zhiguang Branch, Xieshenghe Rice Shop, Jinyuan Mirror Shop, Xinyi Money Shop, Xichangxiang Shop, Yongxingxiang Bamboo Shop, Xiehexing Coal Shop, Hengfengxiang Winery, Dachangrong, Xinruchun Noodle Restaurant, and Guxiangzhai Mounting Shop, stating that they had received notices from the landlord saying that the houses would be demolished soon and they were required to move out immediately. The tenants of the two lanes felt that the situation was not stable and it was difficult to comply, so they went to the landlord, Xie Bingru, to request an extension of the lease term and a temporary postponement of the demolition. However, all requests were rejected. The shopkeepers and residents of the lanes sent a letter to the Business Association of the road, requesting assistance. After learning about the situation, the association sent personnel to investigate the lane and found that the houses were still strong and had not been built for many years. In principle, there was no need to demolish them. At this critical time, the safer areas in the concession have become shelters, and there is a problem of too many people and too few houses. There are about eighty or ninety households in the lane, and hundreds of refugees are living there. If the houses are demolished suddenly, it will not only affect the housing problem but also create social unrest. It is reported that the association has sent a letter to the landlord of the lane, advising him to extend the lease term during this time of national crisis. It is also reported that the person in charge of the association said that he hopes that all parties will uphold justice and provide sympathetic assistance. The Ju'an Shop sent a letter to the Chaozhou Association, saying: "Respectfully, our shop leased land from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at Xiaodongmen, French Concession, Yangxing Street, in 1929 and built a building. Our shop invested heavily in the repairs. The building's official address is 34 Yangxing Street. The number was connected later to a flat warehouse, number four. Our shop invested in the construction of a warehouse on top of the flat area. Both parties signed a seven-year lease agreement. For years, the rent has been collected by the China Business Company on behalf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. On January 2, this year, the China Business Company sent a letter on behalf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting the rent for January, February, and March. On January 5, we paid the rent of 470 taels in full and received a receipt. After the rent was paid, on March 6, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company suddenly surrounded the rented building at number 34 with bamboo fences (on a Sunday) and demolished the roof of the warehouse that we had invested in building. They claimed that the land had been returned to the Sandetang and tried to shirk their responsibility and break the contract. On February 16, we applied to the First Special District Court for an injunction to stop the demolition, which was approved. However, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company knew that we had filed a lawsuit first and could not wait. They used foreigners to forcibly demolish the building. We ask, the warehouse was built with our investment, and there was a contract between both parties. Also, the rent for January, February, and March of this year had been collected, and the Second Special District Court had approved an injunction. Under any circumstances, the houses could not be demolished. However, they are now relying on foreign forces to forcibly demolish the building without hindrance. Shanghai is a civilized area both Chinese and foreign. It is a place where laws are well-defined, but there has suddenly been a dark act in which there is no sun. This cannot be explained. We should report the situation, including the contract, a film of it, and a copy of the rent receipt, and ask you to forward it to the Shanghai Housing Association and the Tenants' Association and the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association to stop the tyranny and to maintain the law and protect the constitution. We beg for your approval and are extremely grateful. With respect, the Chaozhou Association in Shanghai, by Ju'an Shop."</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:22, a fire broke out accidentally in the warehouse of the Guohua Rock Sugar Factory at 597 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession. The flames immediately lit up the sky, and the fire spread rapidly. Moreover, most of the factory's raw materials were liquid, so it was difficult to extinguish the fire once it spread and overflowed onto the ground. Although the firefighters tried their best to put out the fire, they had little effect. It was not until 6:43 in the evening that the fire was extinguished. All the factory's buildings and goods were destroyed, and the estimated loss is worth tens of thousands of yuan. It is reported that there was fire insurance.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Kidnapping Case in the Refugee Camp <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>An Old Woman from Nanxiang with Malicious Intentions</p>
<p>Kidnapping a Girl and Selling Her Next Door</p>
<p>Wang Ganshi, an old woman from Nanxiang in her sixties, fled when our army retreated to the second line of defense and the enemy occupied Nanxiang. On the way, she kidnapped a five-year-old girl, Wu Yaxian, who spoke with a Chongming accent, and claimed that she was her granddaughter, leading her to escape. They were rescued by the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association and brought to Shanghai. They first stayed at the Great World Refugee Camp and then moved to the Third Refugee Camp of the association at 751 Avenue Albert. On the afternoon of the 16th, the old woman tried to sell the girl to Zhou Lishi, a refugee from Jiangwan, asking for four yuan. The manager found out and stopped them, but still thought she was her granddaughter and did not investigate. However, the old woman did not repent and again negotiated the sale of the girl to Sun Yangshi (from Nanjing, living at 9 Xipushi Road) through the bamboo fence in the garden of the camp at 2 or 3 o'clock the next afternoon, asking for eleven yuan. The manager, Wang Hengyun, saw this and reported it to the director of the camp, Huang E, who detained the old woman and the girl and questioned Zhou Lishi and Sun Yangshi about the sale of the girl. It was then discovered that the girl had been kidnapped by the old woman. After Director Huang reported the matter to the General Association for instructions, the chairman, Zhu Ziqiao, and others learned that the old woman dared to take advantage of the war to kidnap and sell children, separating families, which was a heinous crime that could not be forgiven. They immediately ordered the old woman and the child to be sent to the French police station for investigation. After accepting the case, the police sent detective Ding Wensheng to investigate and sent them to the Second Special District Court for prosecution on the 257th article of the criminal law. Judge Luo Renji opened the court and heard the case. First, the lawyer of the police station, Gu Shouxi, explained the case, and Yuan Qingping, the representative of the relief association, Huang E, the director of the refugee camp, Wang Hengyun, and Zhou Lishi and Sun Yangshi testified that the defendant took advantage of the disaster to kidnap the child and sold her in the camp. When questioned, Wang Ganshi tried to deny it and avoid punishment. Judge Luo checked the confession and, finding that the case was clear, announced the end of the trial and scheduled the sentencing for the 26th. The girl was temporarily handed over to the refugee camp to be cared for and claimed. The association is now taking photos and posting them in the newspaper to find the family and claim her.</p>

<p>Because Some Japanese People Going to Manchuria Have Illegal Behaviors</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army occupied Manchuria, the Japanese government has spared no effort in advocating immigration and publicizing benefits. As a result, the number of Japanese people going to Manchuria has increased daily like a river of carps. The entire territory of the three northeastern provinces has suddenly increased by dozens of times the number of Japanese expatriates. However, most of the Japanese people going to Manchuria are unemployed vagrants. They often engage in improper behavior due to economic oppression, and they are also confused by the propaganda of "Manchuria and Mongolia being a land of gold," and they all have the idea of getting rich. When they arrive in Manchuria, not only do they have no job to seek, but they are all destitute. According to the Yokohama Trade News, the Kwantung Government Police Bureau has issued a warning prohibiting Japanese expatriates from going to Manchuria without authorization. The article stated that the situation in Manchuria and Mongolia has come to an end due to military actions. Recently, the number of people going to Manchuria from the interior has suddenly increased. It has been found that those who go to Manchuria to find jobs, centered on Fengtian, gather in groups in various cities along the South Manchuria Railway. As a result, it is impossible to accommodate them. Moreover, these compatriots are confused by the propaganda and believe that they can make a fortune as soon as they arrive in Manchuria today. When they leave the country, they only prepare travel expenses. After arriving in Manchuria, they are penniless and rely on their fellow villagers to make ends meet, or seek protection from the police station, or even engage in various illegal activities, disrupting public order and tarnishing the image of the Japanese people. Therefore, they warn their compatriots in the preparation era not to go to Manchuria rashly.</p>

Taishan County has set a time limit of one month to raise 300,000 yuan, which can purchase about four airplanes. Zhongshan County has also established an Aviation National Salvation Association. On the 3rd of this month, the entire county's populace held a civic assembly and resolved to ask County Magistrate Tang Shaoyi to allocate the 620,000 yuan in savings of the Populace Industrial Company to purchase airplanes. County Magistrate Tang has already agreed to transfer the 300,000 yuan that the county government owes the company as a loan, which can be implemented after the Finance Department approves it. As for the nine subordinate counties of Nanlu Gaozhou Leizhou, it has also been resolved that within the nine subordinate counties, small counties will donate to purchase one airplane, and large counties will donate to purchase three airplanes, and form a Gao Leizhou nine subordinate counties national salvation air force. In the Chao-Mei area, Shantou City recently collected rent donations from the Shantou Chamber of Commerce, which can obtain about 240,000 yuan. A fighter plane has been purchased at the beginning of the month. Currently, the Air Force Headquarters has sent special personnel to Shantou, Chaoan, and Puning to build airfields. Chaoan County convened a conference of all circles by the Self-Government Preparatory Committee last month and resolved to raise 65,000 yuan to purchase airplanes. The fundraising method is to allocate funds according to the previous military needs treasury bond allocation plan by each autonomous region, and to organize the Chaoan All Circles Aircraft Purchase Committee by the five organizations and groups of the County Party Department, the County Government, the Trade Union Branch, the County Chamber of Commerce, and the Self-Government Preparatory Committee to be responsible for handling it. Puning County resolved to raise 40,000 yuan to purchase one airplane at the second conference of all circles, which was planned by the County National Crisis Relief Association and set a time limit of one month to raise enough to order. The populace of Meixian County also decided to raise 100,000 yuan for the purchase of airplanes. As for the overseas aspect, the Guangdong expatriates in the United States have established an aviation school, which can train 3,000 aviation talents in the short term, and is raising money to purchase airplanes in the United States, which can obtain more than 50 airplanes. In addition, the Guangdong expatriates in Little Luzon Port have recently been actively carrying out aviation donations. Li Qingquan, a Guangdong businessman in the port, personally donated 10,000 yuan as an advocate, and the other businesses have enthusiastically contributed. It is estimated that 1 million yuan can be raised in the port. This shows the enthusiasm of the populace to resist Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Bandits on the Fujian Border Retreat in Different Directions <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The bandits on the border between Fujian and Jiangxi took advantage of the tense situation in Shanghai before and engaged in large-scale activities. One group attacked and captured Wuping Shanghang from Huichang, another group attacked and captured Liancheng Ninghua from Changting, and another group invaded Pucheng Guangze from Chongan. The situation in western and northern Fujian suddenly became tense. Now the two units of Yu Hanmou and Li Yangjing from the Guangdong army have decided to go to Jiangxi and Fujian to encircle and suppress them on a large scale. The bandit side is quite panicked and has abandoned unnecessary areas to shorten the battle line. Zou Qi's troops have retreated from Pucheng Guangze to defend Chongan. The 56th Division Liu Shangzhi Brigade sent the Gantang regiment to enter Chongan from Jianou to pursue. They defeated the bandit masses in Tanshis, advanced to the vicinity of the Da'an bandit nest before returning. Zhang Dingcheng's troops also withdrew from Wuping Shanghang and still guarded Huichang. As for the Zhong Shaokui brigade, which retreated to Fengshi on the border between Fujian and Guangdong, they are reorganizing their troops and preparing to cooperate with the Guangdong army to open into Hangwu. Liancheng was also recovered by the Huang Yuebo unit of the county's civil regiment. Ninghua was attacked by the Zhou Zhiqin brigade from Jianning. The bandits in the county belong to Luo Binghui's troops and are small in number, so it should not be difficult to recover. Currently, the vanguard of the Guangdong army units entering Fujian have arrived at Yanqian Songyuan in Wuping from Jiaoling, and Fengshi in Yongding, and will advance to Changting. However, the newly formed Second Division Sixth Brigade, the two regiments of Yi Qiji and Ma Hongxing, which are currently stationed at the junction of Yong'an Qingliu, suddenly mutinied due to demanding military pay and kidnapped Brigade Commander Lu Xinming to the junction of Qingliu Guihua to leave. It has been found that the three counties are located in the center of northern and western Fujian, and the situation in that area is bound to change again. (March 15)</p>
