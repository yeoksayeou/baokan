<h3>韓劉内戰將如何制止　翰</h3>
<p>如此嚴重之國難。不足以制止内戰。中央政府之命令。不足以制止内。戰人民團體之呼籲。不足以制止内戰。然則其他將更有何種力量。足以制止此内戰。夫以此三者重大之壓迫。而尙不足以遏止内戰。必其内戰之理由。更重要於此三者而後可。今試問韓劉之内戰。究有若何重要之理由乎。一方曰阻撓剿匪也。搜括民財也。截留國税也。而一方則曰相逼太甚。不得已而出於自衛也。此種内戰理由。亦僅爲以前内戰普通習用之口號。在此敵騎縱橫國危如卵之情勢下。獨不能稍忍須臾。以待政府之處置。與公理之判斷乎。外侮之來。國人無論如何哀呼軍隊。奮起以抗强敵。而軍隊置之不聞。内戰之起。國人無論如何哀呼軍隊。抑忿以顧大局。而軍隊又置之不聞。此我國人之所痛心者也。</p>
<p>數年以來。内戰之成績。無非糜財耗械擾民害生。增加工商業之苦痛。予匪以騒動之機會。馴至外侮之來。而無暇以自救。此種現象昭昭。凡爲軍人者。宜已早有所覺悟。縱不能如劉珍年之通電。共赴邊徼。禦彼强敵亦應稍抑權利之慾念。化除猜忌之成見整飭軍備。枕戈以待時機。乃不謂一聲内戰。起於東魯。使我國民聞之。瞠目撟舌而不知所措。敵人聞之。更增其宣傳我弱點之口</p>
<p>實。結果直將影響於國聯國難之來。正無法以謀自救。今乃非特不謀自救。而反以加重救國之困難。此又我國人之所痛心者也。</p>
<p>非戰大同盟莊嚴偉大之盛會。成立尙未及一月。該會章程。於政治糾紛初起時。先向兩方勸告。不聽則進面拒絕合作。採取和平適宜之方法以制裁之。夫以我無實力之國民。其所持以與有槍階級抗者。自惟以拒絕合作而止。此外固無更有力之方法。但其實我拒絕合作。而彼並不需要與我合作。則我將奈何。或我拒絕合作。而彼偏要與我合作。不許我拒絕。我又將奈何。總之此莊嚴偉大之非戰大會。實際上不過以空言表示我民意而已。彼軍人旣置民意於不顧。則空言又安有效力。今韓劉事起。非戰會已發電向兩方勸告之矣。果仍不聽。是否將進而拒絕合作。果拒絕合作。又將用何法以實行拒絕。此誠足爲非戰會有無能力之第一次試騐。然我敢謂其希望亦微矣。</p>
<p>在此險惡萬分之環境下。尙敢悍然不顧一切。掀起此害國禍民之内戰。更不慮其牽動擴大而影響及於全局。則非其他種種力量所能制止可知。今日我人所希冀者。仍惟在其良心尙未盡滅。於其最後能一動之耳。其他又何望哉。</p>

<h3>惲蕙芳案三律師之辯詞</h3>
<p>▲汪首席檢察官之論告</p>
<p>惲蕙芳案前日審理判决各情、已誌昨報、茲再將被告律師趙琛·沈鈞懦·李祖虞等是日之辯論及首席檢察官汪祖澤之論告續紀於次、</p>
<p>趙律師首先發言、謂捕房訴被告有三罪但何者須被告負責、何者不應被告負責、殊有研究價值、查捕房所訴第一罪爲刑法三百十八條妨害自由捕房律師以販日貨爲個人之自由權利、爲約法三十七條所許、但該條文尙有（妨害公共利益者、國家得以法律禁止）等語、所謂自由權利、須在法律範圍、故約法十七條規定、在不妨害公共利益内、應受法律保障、反之卽不應受法律保障、自九一八一二八事變以來、我同胞所爲愛國運動、咸一致站在民族立場、乃奸商則不顧一切、販賣日貨、此卽所謂妨害公共利益之行動、法律不獨不當予以保障、且實觸犯刑法一百十條之外患罪、敵人之飛機大砲、每日仍在恐嚇、熱河平津形勢危急、雖未實行開戰、然似近戰爭之局勢、錢庭長聆至此、諭知該律師就法律内辯護、趙遂續稱、販賣日貨、實係非法營業、政府已一再頒佈長期抵抗命令、總理三民主義之民族主義第五講、闡明抵抗意義、甚爲透澈、謂抵抗方法有兩種、一積極一消極、消極卽不合作之謂、是故抵制運動、係遵奉總理遺囑政府命令、彼奸商破壞此項運動、自應予以警告、殊不能自爲犯罪、况商會等團體、亦早經通告、一致抵制仇貨、卽國聯猶有經濟絕交之規定、不先抵抗、焉能期他人贊助、由是而論、足見所控妨害自由權利部份實不成立、第二罪爲刑法二百八十二條殺人未遂、此案主體、實屬錯誤、捕房以爲法租界炸彈案、旣係被告所爲、則英租界炸彈案、自亦被告所爲、須知該團體已經被告供明由兩人組織、而永昌煤號被投炸彈、業有證人到庭證明、並非惲蕙芳所投、何能代人受過、被告在捕房所供、乃轉述蔡耀祖之言此項供詞、僅可參考而已、當以直接審理所得者爲可信、况永昌一彈、雖曾傷人、傷究輕微、捕房何不以傷害罪起訴、而必以殺人控告被告絕不能負此罪責、第三罪爲刑法二百條持有炸裂物、但搜出一彈係蔡所有、被告雖亦有兩彈、然俱用罄、此彈被告亦不能負責、總之第一罪無處罰之必要、第二罪主體並非被告、第三罪被告更不應負責、依照最高法院歷年判例、極言之被告不過爲連續犯、應請依法諭知免訴、繼由沈律師辯論、捕房所訴殺人未遂罪、在捕房則以被告係共同犯、然據事實所證明、被告確未同謀、炸彈亦非被告所有、且被告一再自白、不欲傷人、觀其對付棉布公所及茂昌兩案、則其言自足可信、當蔡投彈時被告猶未到塲、顯非共同實施、故所訴事實、殊屬錯誤至搜出一彈、旣係蔡者、自不能歸被告負責、所可討論者、僅棉布公所一案、但其目的爲警告奸商、旣非個人侵害個人、亦非公衆侵害個人、彷彿代表公衆侵害個人、此種情形、確爲特别、似未可就普通行爲而論、深合刑法第七十六條之規定、應請格外注意、繼由李律師辯稱、關於妨害自由部份、實係連續犯、應予免訴、至殺人未遂部份、捕房亦認炸彈由蔡所投、惟稱被告同去、然被告今則否認、自以直接訊問所得爲眞實、顧蔡原亦無殺人意實以當時所處地位、頗難暸然於店内事物、致有傷人之誤沈律師因復補充意見、謂犯罪原因不在被告而在於販賣日貨之奸商、捕房以爲欲消滅此種事件、須將被告嚴懲、竊恐適得其反耳而雙方律師對於連續犯問題、仍互相辯論、良久始已汪首席檢察官乃起而論告、謂本案犯罪事實、一般觀念、咸認爲愛國心所激動、但犯法自犯法、愛國行動自愛國行動、</p>
<p>不能相提併論、故本案應就法律事實方面求解决、不必遷就情感、查所訴三罪、就妨害自由部份言被告有二個行爲、一在法租界、一卽山西路、此二個行爲、是否連續應否以一罪論、根據最高法院判例、雖時間地點俱不同、然用意則一、自應照刑法七十五條連續犯論、允予免訴、持有爆裂物部份、此項爆裂物、係預備犯妨害自由等罪需用、故應從一處斷、殺人未遂部份、雖被害人未到庭、不能指被告在場、但據被告自白、事前與蔡相商、臨時且同去、目擊蔡投彈、雖今日當庭則稱蔡先去、彼後去、然共同犯罪嫌疑、實難推諉、自應負共同責任、被告縱言無殺人之意、此實無從證明、惟爆裂物施用之結果其危險則盡人所能預期、故應以刑法二百九十四條處斷、並依同法三十條及七十七條、分别量予酌减刑期云云、錢庭長遂依據二九四條傷害罪處斷、於應科刑期内爲减輕兩個二分之、一而判徒刑三月、當由原保將惲保出、是否上訴、刻猶未聞也、</p>

<p>▲警察趕到肉票當塲截回</p>

<p>遂將蘭生綁架　扶上汽車時、該匪等祗顧肉票、徐中堂即乘間逃出、奔赴警局報告、該派出所巡官田良聞報、立即率同長警、飛奔至出事地點、見有汽車一輛、肉票猶被各匪監視、坐於車中、田巡官等遂上前兜捕、各匪分頭逃竄、該警等遂得</p>
<p>當塲截回肉票　迨警察將肉票救出時、汽車遂乘間開駛馳逃、其時該處保衛團亦聞訊前來、帮同兜拿、田巡官等又跟踪追捕、直至五區五所轄境西唐家橋四號綁匪葛友生家見該四匪正在吃飯、一見警察、遂四散逃竄、田巡官等上前</p>

<p>匪婦沈陳氏等　及彈売一枚、一併解送吳淞七區第一所、經楊所長親自訊問、據該匪等供稱、名陸江生、住陸家港、廿八歲、今日係葛友生·沈杏林·二人邀我帮忙、同往借錢、手槍是我的、又據張毛富供稱、住五區五轄境張家宅、三十六歲、餘語與陸相同、又據沈陳氏供稱、伊夫今日請張毛富等同往徐中堂家借錢、並非搶刦等語、楊所長以肉票當塲截回、證據確鑿、豈容狡賴、且查得張陸二人、係</p>
<p>當地著名流氓　平素行爲惡劣、此次被拿、尙敢堅不吐實、是屬藐視法令、若不從嚴法辦、不足以儆匪胆、除飭令長警嚴緝逸匪外、一面備文於日派警將獲匪陸江生·張毛富·沈陳氏·三名口、一并解送公安總局、按律懲辦、据稱徐中堂之次子全生、於去年八月間曾被該匪等綁去、嗣經請人向匪接洽後贖回、此次長子被綁、已爲第二次、</p>

<p>自由談	九三老人馬相伯語錄五六十年前的世界　　凌博士代申報館敦請相老人撰一紀念論文，述六十年來的世界學風。商量結果，我先在徐匯藏書樓中，做番搜集史料工夫，寫成了一張大事年表，呈相老人閲後，便暢談了片刻。　　一八八一年（即光緒七年）相老人自述在高麗，和日本竹添進一郎周旋。那一年，高麗亂，中國用兵一年多，得無事一年，又復亂起來。相老人因此赴美國，自已叙過一件事蹟：｜　　光緒十一年間，斐拉代爾省，爲紀念華盛頓，開百年大會，童子軍有砲隊馬隊等等，而軍官皆童子。時駐美法使顧謂老人曰：（此其國，誰敢與較！一）（引民國民照心鏡）後游英國，觀光牛津劍橋等著名大學。相老人説，有許多名人肄業該校時的座位，依舊保留，作爲勝蹟。隨後又到巴黎，當時歐陸大學尙很重視古文，拉丁文，希臘文，都是必修科。　　又述一件歷史的事件説道：意大利初統一時奪羅馬敎宗的領土，大軍圍攻，敎宗當時，德讓爲懹，下令四方來衛聖京的義勇軍，勿得應戰。竟有一位養勇軍人，看破世俗，進修道院，跋涉重洋來華傳敎；相老人還親自見過他呢！這問題直到最近才解决，意大利仍奉天主敎爲國敎，可見以德服人勝以力服人！　　談到日本，楊守敬乘他們賤漢學時，訪得大批古書購回：不過賤漢學還尊漢人：現在世界大不同了，言下有滄海桑田的感歎！廣州拾零  阿彦　　|觀察的一般|　　在廣州的酒菜茶館裏，茶房們的面孔永遠是互板板的。他們不呌你（先生），也不殷勤的招待你，無論顧客們的身分怎樣，他們都是一律看待。表　　面上似乎很冷淡，但分内的事情都是很能盡責的。　　敎育特别發達，普通人家都給兒女受相當的敎育，所以文盲日漸减少。每天早晚兩中午，馬路上熙來攘往的幾乎盡是男女學生。女學生服白衣黑裙，裙子之高，幾乎連屁股都可以看見。　　女人大都是早熟的，十三四歲的已高聳胸部，所以有人説十六歲以上的女子非處女的多。她們看男性與上海女人有些不同。上海女人必得在你不看她的時候才看你，她們在遇見滿意的男性時，往往要看個滿足，弄得對方面無法應付。　　黃包車夫的忠實，出於我們意料之外的。討價最多不會超過十仙以上。到目的地後也不要你加他錢，即使拿角子給他找，他也照市價計算，從不扣你一仙或二仙，這足以表現硬綳綳的廣東民族性的一般。　　廣州的租界，即沙面，與廣州僅一河之隔，但因爲廣州本市的建設很好，所以市民們到租界去的很少，我個人在那裏半年，沒有去過租界一次。絲絲皆辛苦  鵑　　日者踐吾友江紅蕉兄之約，參觀美亞織綢廠、由該廠總恊理蔡聲白高事恒二君殷殷招待，説明一切、自經緯廠以迄印煉成品等廠，無不遍歷。千餘男女工人，孜孜力作，秩序井然，蓋得力於科學管理法者。所製印花雙縐與喬其紗，柔美絕倫，視舶來品有過之無不及，顧其工作之過程，至爲繁重。昔人進盤餐，念及農人耕作之劬勞，因有粒粒皆辛苦之嘆。茲見機上織錦女，十指摻摻，歷碌不輟，亦復絲絲皆辛苦也。寄語羅綺叢中人，其念之哉！其念之哉！小的當道  鳳　　|越小越妙|　　現在這年頭兒隨便甚麽都是（小）的當道。凡是一種名詞，加上了一個形容字（小），那麽，這個名詞所代表的東西，便能大大的受人歡迎。現在試舉幾個例子。　　妻子的代名詞是老婆。老婆上面加個（小）字，便比了沒有（小）字的受丈夫的寵愛了。住宅的代名詞是公館。公館上面加個（小）字便比了大公館闊綽了，先生是妓女的代名詞。先生上加個（小）字，便益發賣得起錢。白臉已很討人歡喜。白臉上加個（小）字，便益發惹人憐愛了。香烟這樣東西，從前是盛行大枝的，現在也縮小範圍，小枝的大盛特盛。中秋的月餅，從前大家拚命的做得大，現在却拚命的做得小，呌做小月餅了。奥斯丁汽車，本來是很有名的，現在時髦人偏偏愛坐裴裴（按即（小））奥斯丁。甚而至於遊民的代名詞（抖亂）之上加一個（小）字，癟三之上，加一個（小）字，似乎比了沒有（小）字銜的來得吃香些。看報的人，看得沉悶，於是乎應運而生了許多（小）報。　　不錯，現在要出風頭，就少不了（小）字。你嘆，不要説社會上甚麽都愛（小），就以國家而論，也是（小的）沾光。我們的東鄰，論人，比我們矮小，論國土，比了我們更小，但是我們這泱泱大國，却沒一處比了我們的東鄰來得風頭健。但不知領土縮小之後，是否也能沾上一些這個（小字）的光？鉛角子  閻重樓　　|社會病態的一種|　　也許現在的社會，就是這樣一個眞僞的兩面社會吧！本來已經很雜亂的中國幣制，從這些鈔票·現洋·大洋·小洋······的裏面，又發現一種鉛角子，據説專有一般奸人，以鉛質仿鑄銀幣，混用貽害社會。　　在上海，可説是每個人，都和這鉛角子發生過關係，都受過這鉛角子的流毒，然而直到現在，鉛角子總是愈出愈多，暢行無阻，未聞當局有取締的辦法。　　我曾經看見過一個黃包車夫，他手裏拿着一個鉛角子，哭喪着臉，他説他跑了很多的路，所得酬報就是這樣的一個怪幣，我想鉛角子所造成的悲劇，當不止如上述的一端吧？　　有位友人告訴我，他的錢袋，從未剩下鉛幣，因爲他如果有一個被拒用的鉛角子，他總是在第二次或者第三次用去了。但我不是這樣，我如果不幸而得來一個鉛角子，我就把它實行監禁，所以我現在已經積存此物不少了。　　據説有一般兑換店，專以賤價收買這種僞幣，而當眞的掉換給人，這種店家當然沒有想到使用僞幣所造成的罪惡，不然，難道他們眞是别具心肝嗎？　　收授角子，都要反覆的察視着授的人恐怕把鉛角子給了人，收的人恐怕得到了鉛角子，這樣已足减少人們的信仰心，何况專做這事情來貽害社會呢！　　我想這事雖小，也該喚起財政當局的注意吧？説部扶輪會　銀絲（二十三）  江紅蕉　　（十二）　　諸綺蘭自已要演説，但是並沒有人請伊，便去招呼伊的父親，敎他想個法子。諸伯方心裏很願意女兒在大庭廣衆之間，出一次風頭，但是袁團長都演説過，其勢，只有舉行揭幕典禮，况且時間已不早，天色漸漸地在暗，還要拍照，决不能再有人演説了，所以他只假意的問道：還有那一位演説？或者女賓還有那一位演説？　　諸綺蘭正咽了一口吐液，打掃喉嚨，想站到台中央去代表女賓演説的時候，縣長突然地説（時間不早我們舉行揭幕禮了，諸先生！請招呼奏樂吧！）諸綺蘭紅着臉只得退後，十分恨着縣長，但是也無可如何。　　紀念碑是用金山石砌造二丈多高，三角柱而兼有塔的式樣很簡單，碑上四個大金字，是（置鎭安寗），和幾行小字是（袁團人楷，守土於斯抗敵一月，勞苦功高，本鎭未入敵手，居民感之，用建此碑，永資紀念。市政委員諸伯方等立）　　碑座的四周，放滿了鮮花，用黨國旗圍在上面，旗幟用兩條紅緞帶縛着，只要遠遠地把長緞帶的活結一抽動，旗便可以脱落而下。　　軍樂已吹動，諸綺蘭神氣十足地手抱鮮花一大束，先走到台前站定，臉上裝滿了笑意，把緞帶一抽，黨國旗把然往下徐徐而下，台上台下，一陣子拍手，誰知旗子只落了一半，似乎被什麽掛住了。　　　緞帶已拽斷，鮮花一束也掉在地上，諸綺蘭的臉，是漲得緋紅。（誰辦這事的？）縣長有些發怒了，諸伯方臉色急得像白紙；但是袁團長瞧着，反因此而笑了。　　（去找一個梯子，走上去把他揭下得了。）袁團長從容地這樣説。　　　軍樂隊倒霉，還汪汪地吹，要多吹十幾分鐘。　　（這紀念碑的地位，眞不好，他是靠着一個大照壁而造，並不四面脱空，而照壁又是矮得可憐，相形之下，已很難相稱；假使把兩面旗子揭去，紀念碑的形式，更是難看無疑）公安局長自已在肚子裏想，於是注意到照壁。　　（咦！照壁後面大槪有個梯子靠着吧？照壁上不是露出一個梯子的頭麽？）公安局長喊了起來。　　諸伯方聽着，爲將功贖罪起見，親自趕下台去，跑到照壁後面，把梯子掮了出來，靠在照壁上，又親自爬上去，把旗子去下。誰知紀念碑的塔形屋簷上蹲着一個人。　　（啊！···啊！···袁瘋子···）會塲上頓時秩序大亂。</p>

<p>言</p>
<h3>從陸根榮黃慧如談到瑞典王太子之次子</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>自從陸根榮黃慧如主僕變愛案發生後，報紙上拼命宣傳，社會上亦十分注意，我眞是莫名其土地堂，江北小山子與李秀英，雙雙潛逃，趙阿狗和王巧雲，在某旅館奸宿，象這樣的新聞，每天在滬上的花花世界中，不知要發生多少，但並不引人注意，而獨於主僕變愛的陸黃一案，視若千古奇聞，這種頭腦不免有些冬烘了，</p>
<p>凡是中華民國的人民，一律站在平等地位，這好象是約法條文中的話，所以主僕二字的名稱，早已不成問題，婚姻自由，又爲中華民國現行法律所規定，是陸根榮與黃慧如的變愛自由，原是天公地道的事，不過陸根榮所差一點，家中已有老婆，似不免犯了重婚嫌疑，其實亦只是手續上的差誤，陸根榮應該先將老婆宣告脱離，再與黃慧如如此這般，那更是理直氣壯名正言順了，</p>
<p>黃陸主僕變愛一案，昨見報載，經高等法院更審，宣告無罪，當因原審檢察官金鶴年，不服判决，向最高法院提起上訴，業經最高法院審核判决，對於檢察官之上訴駁回，現在陸根榮與黃慧如，猶如奉旨完姻，當堂擇配，一對青年夫婦，從此可以雙宿雙飛，完全自由了，故原檢察官金鶴年，定欲煑鶴焚琴，（拆鴛鴦分兩下裏，）未免罪過，而最高法院，能替天行道，將上訴駁回，眞是勝造浮圖工級，</p>
<p>或曰，最高法院雖將上訴駁回，僅僅認陸根榮竊盜罪不成立，並不認陸黃有夫妻身分，可以自由同居，但這篇賬現在還有那個來算呢，或説陸根榮還有黃臉老婆在，河東不免獅吼，其實不然，陸根榮之妻，完全是一村婦，她看見男人領了一位千嬌百媚的閨閣千金回來，十分榮幸，當然自願退避三舍，那裏還敢與千金小姐去吃乾醋呢，</p>
<p>我國人的頭腦，如此冬烘，而外國人的頭腦，更要冬烘得厲害，昨見報載，瑞典王太子之次子倫拉德，本年三月，與商人之女在倫敦結婚，致因此喪失王族權利，外國人頭腦之冬烘，於此可想，現在倫拉德擬在瑞京開一劇塲，自行管理，自任劇中主角，倫拉德情願剥奪王族權利，而甘與商女結婚，本來（易覓無價寳，難遇有情人，）我原是深深地拜服倫拉德的勇氣，不知幾位閲報的先生們，倘然遇着這樣勢不兩全的事件，不知情願做倫拉德呢，還是情願做王太子之次子，敢問，</p>

<h3>蝕印術　（續）</h3>
<p>— 愼水</p>
<p>二，絲織物蝕印法</p>
<p>絲織物的蝕印法，大槪和毛織品的相同，並且所要用的蝕印劑亦相彷彿，其中以氫氧化亞硫酸鹽最爲普通而重要，不過在彩色蝕劑中，就多用錫鹽蝕印劑，因爲錫鹽能使色彩活潑光輝，因此多用之，他們的配合成分各舉例：</p>
<p>（甲）氫氧化亞硫酸鹽蝕印劑</p>
<p>氫氧化亞硫酸鹽|一七五克，不列顚樹膠|三五○克，水|六○○克，</p>
<p>印好後，祇須蒸浴五分鐘就可以取出洗凈，</p>
<p>（乙）錫鹽彩色蝕印劑</p>
<p>染料|二○克，酸醋|一二○克</p>
<p>，樹膠水|七○○克，錫鹽|一○○克，硫精化錏|三○克，檸檬酸|二○克，</p>
<p>印完畢必須蒸浴半小時，才能取出洗凈，</p>
<p>三，棉織物蝕印術</p>
<p>棉織物品對於普通應用最廣，却也不能不盡力使牠美麗，而其染法亦較容易，所以有多種染料都可染上，如鹽基性染料，硫化染料等，因此對於再加的蝕印劑所起的化學作用也就兩樣，不得不有各異的蝕印劑才能應付，種類繁多，現在祇能把這兩種説一説：</p>
<p>（一）對於鹽基性染料的蝕印術</p>
<p>氫氧化亞硫酸對於多種鹽基性染料，不能發生蝕去的作用，所以要用一種氯酸鹽，牠對於鹽基性的染料非常容易蝕去，可是應用一不得法，也就容易損害織品，現在有一種亞硫酸鉀才不致損害織品的纖維，今且把配合的分量寫在下面：</p>
<p>亞硫酸鉀|六○○克，不列顚樹膠|三○○克，水|六○克，濃苛性鈉液|六○克，醋酸鈉|二○克，</p>
<p>蝕印好，蒸發五分鐘，洗凈就好，唯一的缺點就是應用不很廣，對於鹽基性染料能被蝕去的，也祇有品紅，藍，及孔雀綠等幾種顔色，</p>
<p>（二）對於硫化染料的蝕印術</p>
<p>應用硫化染料染布疋的很多，因此他的用法簡便，而很有耐性，若用氫氧化亞硫酸鹽及錫鹽蝕印術去蝕印，在洗濯時，又要起氧化作用，恢復其本有的色彩，所以多用氯酸礬土之蝕印劑，其配合如下：</p>
<p>一列顚樹膠|二五○克，氯酸礬土溶解液六○○克，氯酸鈉|一七○克，黃血鹽|一七五克，</p>
<p>如要彩色蝕印，那末所用的顔料必須用撫機顔料如鉻黃，鉻橙，銀朱等都能適用除此均不合宜，（完）</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3>復廉君之星期可廢除乎</h3>
<p>— 振止</p>
<p>鄙人前在本欄内發表過一篇廢除學校星期休假之建議，其題意特將學校標</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>出，正因有别於其他職業，蓋其他職業，星期之休假不廢除，固亦爲社會之害，但尙爲末而非爲本，廉君昨在本欄發表星期可廢除乎一文中，亦能明悉此衷，將鄙意加以闡釋，曰原振止君之意，我國不能强盛，實由於科學之不昌明，科學之不昌明，由於人民智識程度之低弱，民智之低弱，由於人民對於學問欠下工夫，欲人民多下工夫，則休假之宜廢除尙矣，不意其下文，則又反乎（改絃易轍急行救濟）之道，而反對星期之廢除，且其題意，則僅（星期可廢除乎），與其所引證之俄報，似皆與學校無關，</p>
<p>各國之行星期休假制者，其人才輩出，我國古時不行星期休假制，又何嘗不出人才，敎員若無星期休假，則生活甚感乏味，不知孔子誨人不倦，其時亦有星期乎，若要敎員之不乏味，不求學子之進步，則休假日儘可增多，又何必效法歐美，我國之國恥日，年有增加，遇之每必休假誌哀，其亦應感覺乏味之需求乎，廉君又謂證之振止君所謂宗敎色彩最濃厚之某帝國主義，尤爲明顯，此語振止固未嘗説，不敢掠美，科學不昌明，不曰星期休假之害，而曰實由一般對於星期之處置不得其當，此處置二字，余學淺不知作何解，姑以臆斷作安放解，則廉君其一新曆之實行家耶，再以臆斷作用字解，余固因國人之不善用，不能用，而曲突徙薪，倡廢除之議，並非因噎而廢食，歐美各國其先以星期休假作宗敎制度，於科學之物質文明，膜不相關，其後科學昌明，星期休假，適足輔科學之發展，反觀我國建設云何，科學云何，若不於此時增加時日，求知及求生産之激增，而行星期休假制，是並行相悖矣，</p>
<p>至云廢除之於學生有害，其理由謂低能之學生，能利用休假之暇，多下工夫於工課，以追及聰慧者，此種無師能自通，則敎員又何必要，學校又何必要，因爲星期休假，有害於職業學業，不然蘇俄何以要改爲不斷工作週耶，所引蘇俄各報作證，其中之意，偏於夫婦唱隨，菽水承歡之見，應知此等，事隨時隨地，可以行之，未可謂反對之理由，不啻自暴其短，</p>
<p>雖然，旣謂討論會則建議之意見，自應有反復之駁質，乃愈見討論會之健全，與建議意見之價值，廉君之意，未可厚非，民知淺陋，恐因廉君一語而增其成見也，</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>一齣家庭全武行</h3>
<p>— 警愚</p>
<p>鄰居黃先生家，前天午後，閻家老幼，玩了一齣全武行，鬧得家宅亂，左右人家，都不得安寗。</p>
<p>黃先生是家道小康，有妻有妾，而且上有老母，下有子女，在普通的一般人中，可算是有福氣的！</p>
<p>它的老婆，也娶自富家，過門之後，連生了幾個女兒，她望子情殷，就慫恿夫婿，把她娘家的婢女阿英，討了回來，納爲簉室。</p>
<p>她旣替男人娶了小星，同時，自已也懷起姙來，十月滿足，居然一舉得男·（有子萬事足），心中的欣慰，可想而知。</p>
<p>她從此驕氣逼人，常將阿英凌辱，老太太頗不直其所爲，對於阿英，特加鍾愛，以是妻妾姑媳之間，時起衝突，黃先生乃調停其中，挈領妻兒，出居别業，俾阿英與老太太同住故宅，而便朝夕侍奉。</p>
<p>黃先生的大女兒咸小姐，在Ｘ中學校念書，前天請假歸來，特到祖母那裏叩問起居，老太太留她午膳，大家同桌而食，阿英吃了一碗，起向旁桌添飯，咸小姐潛將她坐的凳子，用足趾勾到桌下，阿英添飯回來，略不留神，坐一個空，跌了一交，把飯碗打得粉碎，急得她滿面羞慚，哭笑不得，不禁破口大駡道：</p>
<p>（嫖那娘的，那個把我凳子撤開）其實她也知道是咸小姐的搗蛋，不過不好當面揭穿，可是咸小姐也不甘示弱於人，亦即正言厲色的詰問她道：</p>
<p>（你要嫖我的娘？我娘在那邊，我拖你嫖去），嘴裏説着，動手就拖，并且搧了一記耳光，阿英怎肯罷休，亦以巴掌還敬，於是你拖我扯，扭作一團。</p>
<p>咸小姐的母親，得了這個消息，馬上趕來，帮同女兒，參加作戰，老太太睇見阿英雙拳難敵四手，恐怕吃虧，亦即陽爲勸阻，陰掣母女之肘，而援助阿英，此時一家四口，攪做一堆，打得落</p>
<p>花流水，桌上的碗盞，也都碎成雪片。　　後來還是黃先生看見鬧得厲害，傳播開去，不像樣子，只好長人做短，左右調停，力向母妻之前，代賠不是，她們也就付諸一嚷，閉口無言，這塲翻江倒海的風波，才告平息！</p>
<p>社會一角</p>
<h3>熱心人招攬是非多</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>張李兩生，向在學校裏，是最稱莫逆，不論怎麽事情，大家都互通聲氣，互相護助，所以交誼上，可説是和親弟兄一般無二！</p>
<p>在去年下季，兩人都由Ｘ中學畢業出來，因爲都是寒家子弟，所以無力去升學，忙着鑽謀職業，解决麫包問題，不久，張生招到了一個商界位置，李生碰不到機會，祗得賦閑家中，他們兩人的家庭，相距甚邇，所以張生拼擋就道時，就鄭重地請求李生，代他把家庭照顧照顧，李生也就一口承諾，於是張生出了門，李生就常常到張家去走走，看看他家中平安與否，回來就把一切情形，寫信報告張生知道，使他客中安心，也可表示自已不負知已的一番囑託呢！　　一天，李生到張家去，發現張生的妻子，有不規正的行動，並且外面的流言，也甚囂塵上，他想張臨走，再三囑託，不論怎麽大小事情，都要請自已留意着，報告他知道，現在旣然發現這種攸關他本人名譽的不幸事件，是得速即寫信給他，况且聞得那個奸夫，是當地一個著名流氓，倒要呌他戒備戒備，免得發姓怎麽亂子，於是他就寫了一封快信，把一切情形，詳細的報告他，並且勸他達觀一點，不要悲憤，還希望他速謀對付方法，來制裁這件不幸的事情哩！</p>
<p>張生接着了這個賽過晴天霹靂的驚人報告，不由妒火中燒，馬上兼程回來，到了家裏，就向她盤詰了一番，當然她是矢口不認的，並且還追究他這個消息的來源！</p>
<p>他在家裏住了幾天，他的妻子，手段玄妙，甜言蜜語的，在枕上刺探他這個消息，究是何來，他經她一陣花言巧語，就老老實實地，把李生報告的話，説了出來，她聽了是李生的報告，就心中把李生恨得切齒似的，就想出了一個移禍江東的妙計，向他説道：（虧你信老李的鬼話，他自已不懷好意，常常來調戲我，被我辱駡了幾次，所以用這種毒辣的手段，來報復啊，你昏了，中他的鬼計呢！）他聽了這一席話，就信以爲眞，把懷恨她的心，馬上轉移到李生的身上去了！</p>
<p>不上幾天，他竟受她的慫恿，而向法院控訴李生，强姦不遂，破壞名譽，且把李生給他的信，作爲證據，李生得知了這個消息，氣得（啞嘴吃黃連，有苦難説，）深悔自已熱心，以致招攬是非，這件事，至今還沒有了結，我想現在的世界，祗有（各人自掃門前雪，不管他家瓦上霜，）方不致惹禍招災，上面李生的事，也是一個明證呢！因爲這件事，足爲青年辦事不愼的殷鑑，故而記之，</p>
<p>如此家庭</p>
<h3>犧牲</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>李老爺死後，李家的家政便完全操縱在大少爺的掌握中了。當然，弟妹們在（長兄當父）的信條之下得服從他，就是李老太太也很依據（夫死從子）的古訓而順從他。那末這李大少爺事實上便已成爲一家之主了。</p>
<p>李大少爺很懂得怎樣來運用自已的權威，這是他最聰明而且最得意的地方。譬如關於自已二妹的婚事他居然敢向母親堅持自已的意見：</p>
<p>（無論如何，二妹總得嫁人的，那末羅先生雖然是年紀大一點，可是終身有靠，不愁吃，不愁住，這還不可以嗎？）</p>
<p>於是母親只得温柔的説：</p>
<p>（不過你要知道，你妹妹到底是不願意的啊！）</p>
<p>（可是我已經答應他了，因爲他是我最好的朋友。）</p>
<p>太少爺氣忿忿地走了出去，讓老母親望着他的背影流淚。她想：</p>
<p>（我的女兒怎麽好嫁給一個三十幾歲而且有了幾個兒女的商人呢？難道我的姑娘就沒有人要了嗎？）</p>
<p>於是母親望着女兒流淚，而二小姐伏在李老太太的懷裏痛哭。好容易母親忍着眼淚説：</p>
<p>（孩子！羅先生的家資雖然比我們好過幾倍，但是年紀太老了，而且是結過婚的，當然，我也不願意你嫁給他，可是你大哥已允許了他，······我又怎好説話呢，假如你爸爸在世，也就不至於如此呀！）</p>
<p>説着説着，又是淚如雨注。以後又嗚咽的説：</p>
<p>（這只是你命該如此，做媽媽的又有什麽辦法可想呢？）</p>
<p>可憐二小姐只是哭，只是糾纒着母親哭。</p>
<p>最後母女們始終是屈服（家長的壓迫之下。</p>

<h3>How to Stop the Internal Conflict Between Han and Liu</h3>
<p>By Han</p>
<p>Such a serious national crisis is not enough to stop internal conflict. The orders of the central government are not enough to stop internal conflict. The appeals of people's organizations are not enough to stop internal conflict. Then, what other forces will be sufficient to stop this internal conflict? If these three major pressures are still insufficient to curb internal conflict, then the reason for the internal conflict must be more important than these three. Now, let us ask what important reason lies behind the internal conflict between Han and Liu. One side says it's to obstruct the suppression of bandits, to extort the people's wealth, and to intercept national taxes. The other side says they were forced to act in self-defense due to excessive coercion. These reasons for internal conflict are merely the usual slogans commonly used in previous internal conflicts. In the current situation where enemies are running rampant and the country is in dire straits, can't they endure even for a moment to await the government's handling and the judgment of justice? When foreign aggression comes, no matter how the people cry out for the military to rise up and resist the strong enemy, the military turns a deaf ear. When internal conflict arises, no matter how the people cry out for the military to restrain themselves and consider the overall situation, the military again turns a deaf ear. This is what pains our people.</p>
<p>For several years, the results of internal conflict have been nothing but the squandering of wealth, the consumption of equipment, the disturbance of the people, the harming of livelihoods, the increase in the suffering of industry and commerce, and the giving of opportunities for bandits to stir up trouble, eventually leading to foreign aggression and no time to save ourselves. These phenomena are obvious. All military personnel should have long been aware of this. Even if they cannot be like Liu Zhennian's telegram, rushing to the border to resist the strong enemy, they should at least slightly suppress their desire for power, eliminate the prejudice of suspicion, and rectify their military preparations, lying in wait for the opportunity. Yet, unexpectedly, a sound of internal conflict arises in Eastern Lu, causing our people to stare wide-eyed and be at a loss. The enemy hears of it and further increases its propaganda about our weakness.</p>
<p>The result will directly affect the League of Nations. When national disasters come, there is no way to seek self-salvation. Now, not only are we not seeking self-salvation, but we are also adding to the difficulty of saving the country. This is another thing that pains our people.</p>
<p>The solemn and grand meeting of the Anti-War Pact has been established for less than a month. The charter of the association states that when political disputes first arise, both parties should be advised first. If they do not listen, then refuse to cooperate and adopt peaceful and appropriate methods to sanction them. As a people without real power, what we can use to resist the armed class is only to refuse to cooperate. There is no more effective method than this. But in reality, if I refuse to cooperate and they do not need to cooperate with me, then what can I do? Or if I refuse to cooperate and they insist on cooperating with me, not allowing me to refuse, then what can I do? In short, this solemn and grand Anti-War Conference is actually just expressing the will of our people with empty words. If the military personnel have already disregarded the will of the people, then how can empty words have any effect? Now that the Han-Liu incident has arisen, the Anti-War Association has already sent telegrams to advise both parties. If they still do not listen, will they then refuse to cooperate? If they refuse to cooperate, what methods will they use to implement the refusal? This is truly the first test of whether the Anti-War Association has the ability. But I dare say that the hope is slim.</p>
<p>In this extremely dangerous environment, they still dare to disregard everything and stir up this internal conflict that harms the country and the people, without considering that it will drag on, expand, and affect the overall situation. It is clear that this cannot be stopped by other forces. What we people hope for today is still only that their conscience has not been completely extinguished and that it can move them one last time. What else can we hope for?</p>
<p>Urgent Telegrams</p>
<h3>Liu's Troops Withdraw from Yantai and Longkou</h3>
<p>The Main Battle on the Jiaodong Front Has Begun</p>
<p>Naval Landing Forces Landed at Longkou</p>
<p>Jiang Bocheng Arrives at Shahe to Meet Han Fuqu</p>
<p>Han Fuqu Telegrams the Executive Yuan, Obeying Orders and Awaiting Central Government's Handling</p>
<p>(Qingdao) On the night of the 22nd, Liu Zhennian's troops changed to an offensive posture, engaging in fierce fighting with Han's troops led by Cao Fulin in the Xize and Jingshan area. The central force of Han's troops was forced back at Dahanjia Bigou. The right wing occupied Gucheng, and the left wing occupied Banmazhuang. Liu's troops took Zhaoyuan and Laiyang as the first line, and Qilu as the last line of defense. The reserve forces in Wendeng and Muping have been fully mobilized. The main battle between the two sides began on the morning of the 23rd. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shih Shih News Agency Yantai Telegram, receiving a telegram from the front on the 23rd, reporting that one battalion of Han's special forces encountered a regiment of Liu's ambush troops in the Jiguan Mountain, Ma'anshan, and Guojiadian area bordering Ye and Lai. A fierce battle ensued, lasting two hours. The special forces suffered considerable casualties. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This area received very reliable news from Yantai stating that Liu Zhennian's troops have suffered a disastrous defeat. Upon hearing the news, Liu's officers and soldiers withdrew this evening. The police chief also left Yantai. At 4:00 AM on Saturday morning, Chinese warships will dispatch 500 soldiers to land and maintain order. This matter has been negotiated and agreed upon. (Reuters Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) A front-line telegram reports that Han received a telegram from the Executive Yuan ordering the cessation of military action, and has ordered all troops to comply. However, yesterday, Zhang Luanji, the commander of the independent brigade guarding Ye under Liu's command, suddenly led two regiments of infantry from the southeast of the city to attack Han's troops. They were met head-on by Li Hanzhang's brigade, resulting in more than ten deaths and the capture of several, including one logistics chief. Liu's troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated eastward, abandoning a large amount of military supplies. Liu's troops also used mortars to bombard the Huoshen Temple in the south gate of Ye. Han ordered his troops not to retaliate. Han inspected the front line on the afternoon of the 22nd, arriving one li outside the west gate. Liu's troops were entrenched along the moat, holding their positions. There were minor conflicts. Han returned to Shahe after the inspection. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Jiang Bocheng Meets Han in Shahe</h3>
<p>(Jinan) At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, Jiang Bocheng, Zhang Weicun, Zhang Yue, and others traveled from Wei in two cars to Shahe, arriving at noon. Han had just gone to inspect Xiaogushan, southwest of Yecheng, in the front line. Han returned at 3:00 PM and met them at Hongshengchang, Han's headquarters. Han described the unavoidable predicament, and Jiang stated that he was ordered to mediate. Chairman Jiang of the Central Committee, Minister He, and Director Zhang all hoped to first cease military action. Han said that this time was unavoidable, and he would obey Chairman Jiang's order, immediately cease military action on the spot, and issue a telegram. Jiang and his party left Shahe at 5:00 PM and returned at 7:30 PM. Jiang immediately telegraphed Chairman Jiang of the Central Committee, Minister He, and Director Zhang, reporting the details of the meeting. At 12:00 AM, they boarded the original car and returned to Ji. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Zhang Shaotang returned to Ji from Wei this morning. The road between Weixian and Shahe was muddy after the rain, and cars could not pass. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) He Yingqin telegraphed Han, sending Xiong Zhemin to Lu to investigate the truth of the incident. Han telegraphed back welcoming him. It is reported that Cheng Lie and Zhang Shaotang are in Wei, and have not yet paid a visit to Han in Shahe because the road is difficult to travel after the rain. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Jiang Bocheng went to Wei by special train with Zhang Yue of the Provincial Committee at 12:00 PM on the 22nd, arriving at 7:00 AM this morning. The county magistrate, party headquarters, and all sectors welcomed him, but Jiang did not get off the train. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Xizhong went to Jin this morning and is scheduled to return to Ji tonight. His trip was very secretive. A certain important person received a telegram from Han from Shahe at 2:00 AM this morning, stating that he had left Shahe and returned to Weixian to meet Jiang Bocheng and others. There is a regiment of Liu's troops firmly guarding Yexian city. There have only been minor conflicts at the front. It is reported that after Jiang Bocheng meets with Han, they will discuss transferring Liu's troops to Anhui to suppress bandits. As soon as a definite solution is reached, it will be presented to Jiang. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu's Talk to Reporters</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu told reporters, "I have always done things without leaving the country and the people. This action was entirely for the people of Eastern Lu. Because I am the chairman, my responsibility is extremely heavy. The whole province is peaceful, but only Eastern Lu is suffering, and I really can't bear it. Jiaodong is part of Shandong's territory, not an independent region, and I cannot ignore it. Liu requested 150,000 yuan in military pay, and only allowing a reduction of 1,000 or 800 is simply a joke. Furthermore, there have been 19 years of war. Liu once plotted to attack the rear of our army, so I had this motivation to attack Liu this time." "In the No. 9 Middle School in Yexian city, the 123rd regiment of the first brigade and the 789th regiment of the third brigade, guarding Ye, attacked this morning, and we retreated after retaliating. There are trench works built outside Yecheng, forcibly seizing people's food. The training corps stationed in Qixia, where the self-defense army has risen up in that area to drive Liu away. Liu's troops withdrew from Longkou, and the Qingdao naval landing force landed." Han also said, "The settlement must involve transferring Liu's troops away. I obey Chairman Jiang, who is very responsible for the public and has been very kind to me privately." Zhang Weicun said, "Han's use of troops was unavoidable. Even though Buddha is benevolent, demons must also be killed." (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Landing Force Landed in Longkou</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Local officials received telegrams claiming that Shen Honglie has dispatched landing forces to Longkou, and Liu's troops have already withdrawn. Two warships are currently docked at Longkou, and the naval authorities are responsible for maintaining order and protecting Chinese and foreign people. Although the naval authorities have declared neutrality in the Han-Liu conflict, they are preparing to land sailors in Yantai when necessary. It is noted that the ports of Yantai and Longkou have been under Liu Zhennian's control for many years. If the navy takes over these two places, Liu's position will be even weaker. (Reuters Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Military Council Formulates a Handling Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) It is heard that the Military Council has formulated a concrete handling plan for the Han-Liu conflict, and will strictly order both parties to comply. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At today's Executive Yuan meeting, regarding the Han-Liu conflict, in addition to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan presenting Han's telegram for report, He Yingqin also reported on the recent military situation of the Han and Liu troops, and Han's reply stating that Liu attacked first, so he had to retaliate, and that he was willing to obey the Central Government's orders. It is heard that the ministers believed that the Han-Liu conflict could not be stopped by a single order from the Executive Yuan, and decided to hand this matter over to the Military Council for handling, and requested Jiang to quickly stop it with force. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Han's Troops Advance Fiercely on Three Routes</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Han-Liu conflict, according to telegrams from Zhifu, Han's vanguard troops arrived in Ye on the 22nd, and launched an attack on Yecheng in the afternoon, but the situation was not very intense. Han's troops plan to take an encirclement posture, advancing fiercely on three routes. The southern route goes straight from Jinkou and Wulongkou to Pingdu and Laiyang. The central route goes from Weixian along the Yanwei Road through Changyi straight to Shahe and Yexian. The northern route flanks Yexian from Yangjiaogou and Hutouya. The troops and reserves of each route have been deployed to the front for a general offensive. Liu's troops are concentrated in Longkou and Laizhou, and have built strong positions in Qixia and Laiyang. Han's plainclothes troops are very active in the villages of Yexian. There are small contacts at the front. The Xiagezhuang, Guyan, Gaowangshan, Jiudian, Dazeshan, Xiaqiu, and other places in the territory of Lai, Ye, and Pingdu have suffered heavy losses. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Yantai) The Han-Liu conflict is rapidly developing to an alarming extent. The issue of reconciliation has become a deadlock. There is talk of war in both Laizhou and Laiyang. The departure of foreign teachers seems to support this. Liu's troops on the southern Laiyang front are currently stationed at the Wulong River, and it is heard that Han's troops are advancing in this direction. It is reported that the two sides are fighting in the Jimo area. Han's aim is clearly to maintain his left flank from Laiyang to the coast, while planning to encircle Liu's troops with the right flank army in the Pingdu area. (Reuters Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Han Sent Two Telegrams to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 22nd, Han Fuqu sent two telegrams to the Executive Yuan, obeying orders and awaiting central government's handling. The original telegrams are as follows: (1) Top Urgent to the Military Council of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, Confidential: I previously received the Executive Yuan's order (dated the 20th) to cease military action and await central government's investigation and handling. I immediately ordered my troops to stop advancing and quietly await investigation and handling. On the night of the 21st, Liu Zhennian sent Zhang Luanji's brigade of infantry and a regiment of cavalry, suddenly attacking my troops' defense line. Fortunately, Li Hanzhang's brigade was well prepared, the officers were calm, and they received the assistance of the people. Liu's cunning plan fortunately did not succeed. I respectfully report this by telegram, Han Fuqu Kouchangwu Shenyin. (2) Top Urgent to the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, Hao Telegram Acknowledged: Liu Zhennian is heavily taxing and plundering the people, and trampling on the people's livelihood. Fuqu bears the responsibility of the local area and is raising troops at the request of the people. There is indeed an unavoidable predicament, as long as the people can get through this, Fuqu will comply with everything. I respectfully reply by telegram, begging for your consideration, Han Fuqu Kouchangshen Shenyin (Central News Agency Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Yue of the Lu Provincial Committee telegraphed to Beijing stating that he accompanied Jiang Bocheng to Wei on the evening of the 22nd to visit Han Fuqu. After the Lu incident occurred, there was only one conflict between the militia and Liu Zhennian's troops. There is no war now. Han is seeking compromise and has complied with the Central Government's order to cease military action. However, Liu Zhennian's troops are publicly announcing their retreat, but are still actively preparing for war. It is hoped that the Central Government will quickly determine a solution to quell the war. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Will Send Personnel to Beijing</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuqu's representative in Ping said that the Jiaodong war will not expand and will be resolved in the short term. Han will send Zhang Yue to Beijing to report the truth and process of attacking Liu. After that, he will go to Han to visit Jiang. Han's troops have deployed more than 50,000 troops, taking a grand encirclement plan against Jiaodong. (Special Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Han's Troops Have Advanced to Pinglidian</h3>
<p>(Yantai) According to recent reliable news, Han's troops have advanced to Pinglidian between Laizhou and Longkou. Liu Zhennian's whereabouts are unknown, and it is heard that he is still on the Laizhou-Laiyang front without any changes. Han's troops are gradually approaching Liu's troops' positions. It is heard that there was a fierce battle at Hutou yesterday, but the number of casualties on both sides is currently unknown. The local authorities here recently dispatched three motorized boats full of munitions to Longkou, but for some reason, they were ordered to return. The three ships arrived in Yantai this morning. The Chinese gunboat Jiangli entered the port this morning and docked not far from the pier. The cruiser Zhaoyao has moved closer to it. It is expected that there will be developments here, but they are likely to be of a peaceful nature. (Reuters Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Han Dong Flies to Xun to Visit Jiang for Instructions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian's representative Han Dong flew from Jing to Xun on the 23rd to visit Chairman Jiang, report the situation in Lu, and ask for instructions. After Han visits Jiang, he may go to Han for a trip and return to Jing in two or three days before returning to Yantai. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong Mediates Between Han and Liu</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong told reporters at 4:00 PM on the 23rd that it was unfortunate that Han and Liu had a conflict during this serious national crisis. Yu had received two telegrams from Liu expressing his obedience to the Central Government and his concession to Han. Given his relationship with Yu, he was reluctant to express his opinions on the matter, but privately hoped for a speedy resolution to avoid the suffering of the people. He had telegraphed Han in his private capacity, informing him that Liu was willing to retreat and requesting him to also cease military action and resolve the matter peacefully. He had not yet received Han's reply telegram and probably had not adopted his opinion. Yu is a native of Lu, and his original home and houses were all burned down by Liu's troops during the suppression of the Red Spear Society. Speaking impartially, Liu had excessively gathered and taxed the people for the two or three years before he went to Jiaodong, and the people's burden was too heavy, which is why he was able to train 40,000 to 50,000 soldiers. However, at the same time, he was able to do his best to suppress bandits and ban opium. In the past two years, he has reduced the people's burden. The roads are now accessible in all directions. The administrative power of each county has mostly been returned to the provincial government. The interception of taxes to fill the military coffers is probably the truth.

<h3>Interpretation of Policy Towards Japan by the Central Executive Committee</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee telegraphed Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Shanghai on the 23rd to reply to the Central Committee members in various locations, interpret the Central Government's policy towards Japan, and hoped that they would come to Nanjing together.

These resolutions have clearly defined a consistent and comprehensive policy from beginning to end. As for countermeasures, we are not only protesting, but also striving for practical preparations. Your instructions are not only in agreement with our intentions, but also aimed at being effective. We cannot guarantee success, but we share the same expectations and demands as the comrades and the entire nation. If the appropriate time comes, the facts will be revealed. However, at this critical juncture, we can only succeed by concentrating the power of our party and strengthening the Central Committee of our party. We earnestly hope that you will come to Nanjing together, so that we can consult with each other day and night, make decisions promptly, avoid delays caused by mail and telegraph, and respond to the cunning schemes that arise. We respectfully reply to you and await your arrival. Central Executive Committee, stamped. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Kidnapping of Two British Nationals in Niuzhuang</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) The location of Mrs. Bowler and Mr. Kirkland has been learned today. A farmer in a certain village saw them. It is said that the two are currently living in a thatched cottage in a certain village 30 miles east of Panshan, away from Niuzhuang, guarded by a number of bandits. They are treated well. The farmer spoke with the bandit leader, who said that the bandits would not harm the two, but they are currently short of food. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Niuzhuang A horseman surnamed Wang, who is an intermediary in contact with the bandits, claimed today that he, Mrs. Bowler, and Mr. Kirkland were kidnapped together, but detained separately. On September 21, the bandits blindfolded him, and after passing through tall sorghum stalks for a long distance, they released him to return, to prevent him from recognizing the direction. The bandits number about 300 and are gathered near Baiguoshu, ten miles north of Yingkou. They ordered him to tell the relatives of the kidnapped to send the ransom quickly. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Niuzhuang It was learned today that when Mrs. Bowler was kidnapped, her two dogs were also not spared. One dog was an Alsatian and the other an Irish setter. Yesterday, the large Alsatian dog suddenly escaped from the bandit den and found its way back to Niuzhuang. When it arrived in front of Doctor Philip's residence, it barked wildly, seemingly indicating that its mistress was still alive not far from Niuzhuang. The two dogs seemed to have agreed that one would bring news back while the other stayed with the mistress. According to a Chinese servant who returned to Niuzhuang today, the small Irish setter never leaves its mistress, sleeping by her side at night and eating the leftovers in her bowl. Although the bandits repeatedly chased it away, it would not leave her side. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The parents of Mr. Kirkland, the British national kidnapped in Niuzhuang, received a recent Reuters telegram from Shenyang, learned of their son's location, and that the bandits are treating him very well, which greatly relieved them. Mrs. Kirkland believes that this news is definitely optimistic, and said that she met a person who was kidnapped by Chinese bandits for three weeks, and was later released because the bandits became tired of him. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Niuzhuang The bandit leader is currently demanding 600,000 yuan in cash, two machine guns, and 500,000 rounds of ammunition as ransom for Mr. Kirkland. As for Mrs. Bowler, a huge amount of cash is required. The horseman was not tied after being kidnapped and had many opportunities to escape, but because he has known Mrs. Bowler since childhood, he could not bear to leave her. The rumor that Mrs. Bowler rode a donkey through the village is not true. She was forced to walk everywhere. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Niuzhuang Doctor Philip's Chinese servant brought a new letter from the bandits, so there is more hope of rescuing the two. The bandit letter reiterates the previous demands, states that they are both safe and healthy, and are being treated well. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>Free State Executive President Fan Lela Presides</p>
<p>Passes China's Education Investigation Report</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Dispute May Not Be Brought Up for Discussion</p>
<p>Tune in to Wireless Broadcasts Every Week Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 23rd: The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed meeting at 11:10 AM today, lasting about half an hour. This was followed by a public meeting. During the closed meeting, Yan Huiqing, the Chief Representative of China, inquired why China's petition to the League of Nations regarding Japanese aggression was listed as the final item on the agenda. Yan also emphatically stated that this matter should be discussed urgently. The Chairman informed Yan that the Lytton Commission's report was not yet complete and that Japan had requested a six-week delay in the discussion after the report was published. This matter will be considered by the Administrative Council.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin Agency, Geneva, 23rd: The League of Nations Council convened this morning at 11:00 AM, presided over by Fan Lela, Executive President of the Irish Free State. It is currently believed here that while the Sino-Japanese dispute is listed at the end of the agenda, it may not be discussed at this session of the Council. Japan seems to have no intention of engaging in a verbal battle within the Council regarding the League of Nations investigation report but is preparing to respond in the League of Nations General Assembly. It is now expected that the investigation team's report will first be discussed by the new Council after the election and then handed over to the special session of the League of Nations General Assembly to be convened in November.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 23rd: The Huimin Pao's Geneva correspondent reports that the (Manchukuo)'s document to the League of Nations cannot be distributed to the members of the League of Nations because in the eyes of the League of Nations, (Manchukuo) is not a real country. The correspondent suggests that (Manchukuo), under Japanese guidance, should apply to join the League of Nations. Furthermore, the League of Nations' response will undoubtedly be the final and absolute touchstone for (Manchukuo)'s demand for independent sovereignty.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 23rd: The Administrative Council today formed a committee with three members to find a solution to the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 23rd: A report to the Administrative Council mentioned the work of the League of Nations Educational Investigation Team in China. The report was passed unanimously. Dr. Yan Huiqing stated that the Chinese government was extremely satisfied with the work accomplished by the investigation team under very difficult circumstances. Although he could not fully agree with all the points made by the team, the members of the investigation team were truly worthy of the highest praise. He believed that the fusion of Eastern and Western educational ideas would surely achieve excellent results.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 23rd: At today's meeting of the Administrative Council, Norwegian representative Han Bailuo stated that many member states have not paid their dues and that if this is not remedied promptly, there is concern that the League will face financial difficulties next year.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin Agency, Geneva, 22nd: Starting from the 25th, every Sunday morning, the League of Nations' two radio stations will broadcast in English, French, and Spanish between 11:00 and 11:45 (Shanghai time 6:20 to 7:05 AM) on the work of the League of Nations.

<h3>British League of Nations Association Studies Stance on Japan</h3>
<p>Better to Withdraw Than Have No Determination to Abide by Covenants</p>
<p>Territorial Changes Not to be Recognized if There is Opposition</p>
<p>▲ Havas, London, 23rd: The Executive Committee of the British League of Nations Association, chaired by Lord Cecil, has conducted a lengthy study of the stance on Japan. The conclusion reached is that it is better for member states of the League of Nations to withdraw from the League than to have no determination to abide by the obligations of the covenant. This conclusion is based on the speeches of Briand and Simon, who stated that any country that is infringed upon and seeks redress can only use peaceful methods and has no right to use other means. The Executive Committee's conclusion also cited moral principles, stating that if a country invades another country and changes its territory, this change should not be recognized if there is opposition from one party.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Minister Araki Sadao Observes the Situation</h3>
<p>Says Japan Will Never Withdraw From the League of Nations</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 23rd: Army Minister Araki met with German journalist Zihilin and Dutch journalist Linde at his official residence yesterday afternoon and replied to the two journalists' questions about the rumors of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, saying that Japan, which considers world peace, would never leave the League of Nations. Since the establishment of the League of Nations, Japan has faithfully worked for the League of Nations, but the League of Nations' response to Japan has been 13 to 1, which is inevitably too harsh. Therefore, if the League of Nations does not understand Japan's position, forcing Japan to withdraw, or hoping that Japan will withdraw, that is another matter.</p>
<h3>Creating Atmosphere in the United States Has Another Purpose</h3>
<p>▲ Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently secretly ordered Saito Hiroshi, the acting ambassador to the United States, to create an atmosphere of withdrawal from the League of Nations in the United States. It is reported that Acting Ambassador Saito hosted a group of news reporters in Washington yesterday and said that if the report is unfavorable to Japan, Japan will undoubtedly take the decision to withdraw from the League of Nations. Regarding Saito's remarks, according to investigations, he has secretly contacted presidential candidate Roosevelt to create a threatening atmosphere with an attitude that disregards everything, attempting to restrain Hoover and instigate American pacifists to oppose Stimson.</p>
<h3>International Situation Changes</h3>
<p>Russo-Japanese Amity and Franco-American Cooperation</p>
<p>Have Become the Focus of Discussion in Parisian Political Circles</p>
<p>▲ Guomin Agency, Paris, 22nd: The theory of Russo-Japanese amity has become the focus of discussion in political circles here. According to the Morning Post's Washington correspondent, Russia and Japan are currently conducting negotiations, with Japan intending to purchase Russian oil and no longer rely on American supply. Japanese businessman Matsuoka is stationed in Moscow to handle these negotiations. Since the United States decided to concentrate the majority of its fleet in Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands, Japan has become increasingly wary and is therefore eager for the success of the negotiations. The success or failure of the Russo-Japanese oil agreement depends on two conditions: (1) improving the convenience of oil transportation, and (2) a compromise between the two governments regarding (Manchukuo). The correspondent also stated that Japan is prepared to allow Soviet Russian goods to be transported into Manchuria with preferential tariff rights in exchange for its recognition of (Manchukuo) and is willing to guarantee the Soviet Russian interests in the China Eastern Railway. At the same time, political circles here are also eagerly discussing the British newspaper reports that France has changed its Far Eastern policy and is seeking friendship with the United States. According to this news, US Senator Reed had lengthy talks with French Prime Minister Herriot and other politicians, suggesting that if France could support the United States' Far Eastern policy, the United States would be willing to help France deal with Germany's demands for military equality. French newspapers have remained silent on this news to date, but diplomatic circles generally believe it to be true, although these negotiations cannot yet be said to have concluded.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin Agency, Moscow, 23rd: The Associated Press has learned from usually reliable sources that Soviet Russia has agreed to accept consuls and attendants sent by the Manchukuo puppet organization, allowing them to reside in Blagoveshchensk, Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, and other Far Eastern ports. Passports for the puppet consul in Blagoveshchensk have already been signed.</p>
<h3>British Conservative Party Inclines Toward Friendliness with Japan</h3>
<p>But Autonomous Regions Unanimously Advocate Alliance with the United States</p>
<p>▲ Guomin Agency, Washington, 22nd: The previous report that US Senator Reed went to Europe under the orders of the State Department to explore the Far Eastern policies of Britain and France has been confirmed today. Reed is scheduled to return to Washington before the release of the League of Nations investigation report. It is reported that the British autonomous regions are advising London to support the League of Nations and support the United States, but a powerful group of conservatives within Britain opposes taking any path that could jeopardize British-Japanese relations. France's attitude is that it is prepared to support the League of Nations because if the League of Nations cannot handle the Northeast crisis, its influence in Europe will be greatly diminished, which is of extreme concern to France.</p>
<h3>US Army Chief of Staff's Tour of Europe Has Significant Meaning</h3>
<p>Purpose Is to Investigate the Military Preparations of Russia's Neighbors</p>
<p>To Make Preparations for Future Far Eastern Warfare</p>
<p>▲ Guomin Agency, Vienna, 23rd: US Army Chief of Staff General MacWalter is currently touring Europe and has arrived in Romania as a guest of the Romanian King. The capitals of Eastern European countries are still commenting on the General's tour of Europe. Political circles here now believe that the General has a mission to investigate the military preparations of the countries bordering the Soviet Union. This is not only related to the Geneva Disarmament Conference, but it is also said to be for the sake of an eventual war between Russia and Japan. US Senator Reed's tour of London and Paris has also aroused various rumors. Although Washington has denied it, this</p>
<p>place and the capitals of Eastern Europe still believe that it is related to the United States' plan to recognize the Soviet Russian government in the near future and to send a delegation to Russia. This does not completely contradict Washington's claim that Reed's trip to Europe was to inquire about the positions of the British and French governments on the Manchurian issue.</p>
<h3>Japan's Adachi Kenzo Assumes the Role of Hitler</h3>
<p>Promoting Fascism</p>
<p>▲ Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: Adachi Kenzo of the National League, under the control of the Japanese military, regards himself as the Japanese Hitler. This morning at 9:20, he led a number of party members to Yamagata Prefecture and other parts of northeastern Japan to travel around and vigorously promote Japanese nationalism, with the annexation of Manchuria and Mongolia as its basic policy. He is scheduled to return to Beijing on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Traitor Bao Surrenders and Is Sent as Envoy to Japan</h3>
<p>▲ Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: Traitor Bao Guancheng, the former puppet mayor of Harbin, has performed meritorious service for the Japanese military and is greatly favored by the Japanese warlords. This time, he has actually been appointed as the puppet envoy to Japan and departed from Changchun at 8:30 this morning via Dalian for Japan. It is reported that before his departure, he talked to Japanese reporters about many ugly words of gratitude to his masters and his willingness to serve Japan faithfully in the future.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee of the International Labor Bureau Passes Italian Proposal</h3>
<p>Advocating a 40-Hour Work Week</p>
<p>▲ Guomin Agency, Geneva, 22nd: The Executive Committee of the International Labor Bureau today approved the Italian motion to implement a 40-hour work week. According to this resolution, a special meeting must be convened to investigate all aspects of the issue and then the issue will be formally placed on the agenda of next year's International Labor Conference. The British delegation and the employers' representatives opposed the motion, but it was ultimately passed by a vote of 16 to 6. Tenant farmers and sailors will be excluded.</p>

<h3>US-Japan Economic Relations</h3>
<p>Japan's Debt to the United States Exceeds 1.8 Billion Yuan</p>
<p>US Trade with the Three Eastern Provinces Decreases by One-Fifth</p>
<p>▲ Hualian News Agency Tokyo Communication: Since the September 18th Incident, the conflict between the United States and Japan in the Pacific has become increasingly acute and is on the verge of erupting. Especially after Japan brazenly recognized the puppet organization, the atmosphere between the United States and Japan has also deepened. According to recent investigations, the economic conditions between the United States and Japan are as follows: Traditionally, the main American investments in Japan have been concentrated in Tokyo, Yokohama, and other places, and the amount has recently reached more than 900 million yuan, including 16,000 (thousands of yuan) in commercial and charitable undertakings, 122,900 in capital directly operated by Americans, 323,870 in Japanese government bonds, 70,818 in Japanese government-guaranteed bonds, 86,280 in municipal bonds, and 286,430 in bonds borrowed by merchants and companies, totaling 905,898. The above numbers are calculated in gold standard, and if calculated according to the current Japanese-US exchange rate, the huge amount is 1.8 billion yuan. As for US-Japan trade, since the September 18th Incident, although Japan has been touting open doors and welcoming investment to the United States, the fact is that US trade with the Three Eastern Provinces has not only failed to increase, but has also decreased to one-fifth compared to the previous year.</p>
<h3>United States Actively Prepares for Military in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Hawaii Rushes to Build Ship Berthing Facilities</p>
<p>▲ World News Agency Honolulu News: Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Hawaii is one of the important bases for the United States in Pacific operations. At a time when US-Japan relations are tense, the United States is striving to enrich the various military facilities in the port. Three weeks ago, there was an order from Washington urging the military authorities of the port to expedite the construction of ship berthing facilities, with an expenditure of 1.25 million yuan. Currently, there are survey steamships cruising everywhere in the port, preparing for the ship berthing facilities.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin Agency, Atlantic City (New York State), 22nd: US Army Air Corps Commander Colonel Zomer spoke here today, claiming that Japan's diplomatic policy is to turn the Pacific Ocean into a Japanese lake.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Conference Faces Many Hidden Reefs</h3>
<p>Russian Representative Demands Political Discussions Be Held Earlier</p>
<p>Britain and France Oppose, Causing Tense Atmosphere at the Conference</p>
<p>Steering Committee Adjourns Until Next Tuesday</p>
<p>Germany Does Not Participate in Extraneous Consultations on the Issue</p>
<p>▲ Guomin Agency, Geneva, 22nd: The tense atmosphere within the Disarmament Conference Steering Committee erupted this afternoon, and considering the future, the disturbances will not end. This was because the Russian representative Litvinov ignited the fuse, almost causing the committee to openly break down, and finally adjourned until next Tuesday to save the situation. When they gathered this morning, Litvinov ridiculed the proposal to discuss the organization and management of the Arms Committee in extremely frank and profound terms while the disarmament process had not yet been determined. When the meeting continued in the afternoon, Litvinov continued to attack, demanding that the conference discuss from a political point of view again, insisting that it would be useless to discuss the second step before the first step problem had been agreed upon. British Foreign Minister Simon, with the support of French Minister Longchamp, strongly debated, claiming that the committee must abide by the agenda. Finally, Chairman Henderson expressed his opinion, declaring that the Steering Committee should only abide by the rules of the meeting and not restrict the scope of debate. However, it is advisable to first contact privately on the German issue. Judging from the final development of the meeting, it increasingly gives the impression that the Disarmament Conference has encountered reefs and must make great efforts to get out of the reefs. That is to say, the adjournment of the Steering Committee this time, although opposed by the French, already has the appearance of an indefinite extension. As for the German delegation, it has repeatedly stated that Germany is determined not to join the discussion until its demands for equality are recognized, and indicated that the German Foreign Minister intends not to reply to Henderson's letter for the time being, but wants to contact Henderson privately. The time of their meeting may be before or after the meeting between Nereis and Simon tonight.</p>
<h3>British Leasehold Issue</h3>
<p>Britain Raises Friendly Negotiations with Japan</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 23rd: British Ambassador to Japan Sir Lindley visited Foreign Minister Uchida yesterday afternoon and presented a fundamental solution private plan regarding the Yokohama and Kobe trading port area permanent leasehold issue, which has been unresolved for many years since the Meiji era, hoping to start formal negotiations based on this. Foreign Minister Uchida agreed to Ambassador Lindley's proposal, acknowledging the start of negotiations. The private plan proposed was: (1) British people will now give up all permanent leasehold rights in the former settlements in Yokohama and Kobe, provided that the Japanese government confirms their future ownership rights. (2) British people should pay taxes to the Japanese government for their owned land and buildings, which is a friendly proposal that acknowledges Japan's reputation as a fully legal country.</p>
<h3>Gandhi on the Third Day of Fasting for the Right of the Untouchables to Participate in Politics</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Pune, 23rd: More Indians have begun to fast to express sympathy with Gandhi and his political views. Gandhi issued a message, asking Indians not to imitate his fast, but to strive to eliminate the class of untouchables. Gandhi is now on the third day of his fast, and there is now a glimmer of hope, as Malaviya declared after visiting Gandhi this morning that the issue of the right of the untouchables to participate in politics is expected to be resolved today.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Huangchuan: All newspaper offices are hereby informed that bandits have been disturbing southern Henan for several years, occupying the areas of Shangcheng, Guangshan, Gushi, Luoshan, and the fifth and sixth districts of Huangchuan for the longest time. As I, Zhang Fang, have personally experienced many places and have more detailed knowledge, the bandit areas have been completely emptied of people, livestock, and belongings. Fields and ditches have been almost completely destroyed. For hundreds of miles, smoke from cooking fires has ceased and no chickens or dogs remain. A scene of desolation is unbearable to witness. Even the remaining ears of grain are scattered. Now that the bandit gangs have fled far away, the area has been restored, and news of the victory has spread, the people have all come here. However, the houses are ruined, and the fields are barren. Eradicating the weeds and repairing the damage is urgent. However, there are no tools or draft cattle, and there is nothing to trade to purchase them. Therefore, those who linger in the wide market, weeping at the doors, are everywhere. At dusk, when their paths are exhausted, sadness comes from within. Some say they must die, and some say it is difficult to live. The old and weak cry and plead, which is heartbreaking to hear. I have investigated the areas of Shangcheng, Guangshan, Gushi, Luoshan, and the fifth and sixth districts of Huangchuan, which are mountainous and picturesque, and used to be rich and fertile areas. Now, the dilapidated walls and ruins have become dens for foxes and rabbits. At this time when the old crops are exhausted and the new crops have not yet come in, it is not possible to appease and gather the people and recruit and appease the refugees unless the government, philanthropists, or charitable organizations provide assistance and give them the means to maintain the current situation and gradually seek the future, so as to avoid the good fields from turning into dense grass and millions of lives from being filled in ditches. The Mid-Autumn Festival has passed, and it is time to sow seeds. Next year, there is still hope for a wheat harvest. Otherwise, once the farming season is over, recovery will be even more difficult. What I have investigated, I respectfully ask on behalf of millions of helpless people, I beseech you to provide relief, and earnestly request you to quickly grant your full support, allocate grain and funds, and distribute them, bestowing blessings on the people. The merit and virtue of this will be immeasurable. The telegram is urgent, and I cannot express my prayers enough. Zhang Fang kowtows and begs for consideration.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Military's Manchurian Construction Fantasies</h3>
<p>▲ Development Plans Published in Japanese Newspapers Mostly Written by Military Personnel</p>
<p>▲ Plans for Colonization, Transportation, and Military Affairs Are Extremely Ruthless</p>
<p>▲ Foreigners Wonder Whether Such Imaginations Exceed Fantasy</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News*'s September 17th Tokyo dispatch states: "Japan has now formally recognized 'Manchukuo.' Newspapers and magazines are filled with articles on the colony's exploitation and development plans, and many are penned by military personnel. While these cannot be regarded as representing the government's will, it must be understood that today's Japanese military can control everything, especially regarding measures concerning 'Manchukuo' and China. Therefore, the opinions expressed in these articles should not be taken lightly. Moreover, the structure and tone of these articles are largely the same; discerning observers know they originate from a single source. Each article begins by stating that Japan's 'great' mission in the Asian continent is partially completed. From now on, the Japanese should focus on developing and securing the fruits obtained by 'our country's warriors sacrificing their lives.' As for the administration of 'Manchukuo,' the articles advocate that the new government, for the sake of convenience, might as well be a Chinese government—that is, composed of Manchus and Chinese. However, one crucial point is that the new government's administrative power and financial integrity must not be impaired in the slightest. In other words, their intention is to imply that the government established by the Japanese military when thirty million 'Manchurians' declared independence, yearning for self-determination, is ultimately untrustworthy. The articles state that Japan, to ensure the government's power and financial integrity, has constructed a 'steel system' managed by Japanese, and has established an internal government overseen by Japanese officials within the 'Manchukuo' government to control its policies. This is merely a small wheel within a larger wheel of ostensible 'autonomy.' Japan is now striving to make the 'Manchukuo' government consistently pro-Japanese. The articles claim that if 'Manchukuo' is not pro-Japanese, if old conspirators and resistors show signs of raising their heads, and if things quickly revert to the old ways, then annexation would be unavoidable. As for colonization, the articles state that the living standards of Japanese farmers and workers are certainly higher than those of Chinese, Manchus, and Koreans. However, farmers in northern and northeastern Japan are now in dire straits, nearly starving. Their current situation is far inferior to opening up the lands in 'Manchukuo.' Therefore, the major obstacle to relocating farmers from Hokkaido to 'Manchukuo' has been largely eliminated. Furthermore, a special zone twelve miles wide will be designated on both sides of the main railways for Japanese immigrants to reside in. Within these zones, doctors, teachers, ironworkers, carpenters, priests, etc., will be stationed. High walls with loopholes for rifles and machine guns will be built around each village. Every household will be given weapons, and all men will be required to undergo regular military training. Residents will swear to serve in the military in times of emergency. The cost of weaponry and the construction of fortresses around each village will be allocated by the central government. The properties of former administrators and their followers will be confiscated, but not distributed to the 'Manchukuo' residents, but to Japanese immigrants. Restrictions will be placed on Chinese immigrants. These model new villages will initially be populated by Koreans, with Japanese village chiefs and mayors appointed. In addition, railway construction can provide employment for Japanese workers and greatly benefit the Japanese steel industry. The northern section of the Huai-Tun Railway is particularly important. It can directly transport products from northern Manchuria to the ice-free ports of the Korean coast and provide an essential transportation route for troops in the event of war with Russia. The Japanese often say that Japan should regard the Hinggan Mountains as its first line of defense on the mainland. Now that this new road is nearing completion, Japan can have a completely self-managed new road directly connecting to northern Manchuria, which is essential for troop movements. Anyone studying the structure of the new 'Manchukuo' government should note the conspicuous absence of a Ministry of Education. It is said that the new country does not want 'black-shirted' youths. The articles also state that the western border of 'Manchukuo' (i.e., bordering mainland China) has not yet been defined. It is hoped that 'Manchukuo' can enable its residents to live and work in peace and become a paradise, so that provinces of mainland China, such as Hebei and Shanxi, will voluntarily return. The articles do not mention Rehe, implying that the Rehe province will sooner or later be annexed into 'Manchukuo.' The articles also mention that 'Manchukuo' will not be able to defend itself against China or Soviet Russia in the future, so Japan should assume the responsibility of protecting 'Manchukuo.' Japan also plans to organize security forces composed of Manchus, Han Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Mongols within 'Manchukuo' to protect internal security. The training officers will be Japanese, which will be the prototype of the 'Manchukuo' army in the future, with plans to train 80,000 people in the first step. According to all the above, these are all plans for Japan to develop and exploit 'Manchukuo.' Many readers are surprised, wondering if such imaginations exceed fantasy. They contain great difficulties and will hinder Japan's internal politics and social organization and its external relations. However, the military will never lightly stop what they have already started. Their attitude is just as the New Testament says: "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."</p>
<h3>The Masses in Jiaodong Rise Up Against Liu</h3>
<p>▲ Liu's Troops Suffer Repeated Defeats and Retreat to Huang County to Defend</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: After the armies of Han and Liu made contact, Liu's troops, to preserve their strength, did not resist Han's troops with all their might and retreated. Therefore, Han's troops made steady progress and occupied Pingdu and Yexian one after another in just two days. However, in the battle of Shentangzhen on the 19th, fierce fighting occurred between the two sides, and both armies suffered some casualties. Liu's troops then retreated to defend Yexian. Later, because Han's plainclothes soldiers had long been lying in ambush in the city, when Han's troops arrived, the plainclothes soldiers responded from within. Liu's troops abandoned the city and concentrated in Zhuqiaozhen to await reinforcements. The vanguard of Han's troops arrived yesterday morning (the 20th) at a place twenty miles from Zhuqiao and began to deploy for the attack and immediately launched an offensive. It is reported that Liu's troops have been shaken by repeated defeats, and Zhuqiao has no natural defenses to defend, so they plan to abandon Zhuqiao and retreat to Huang County to defend. Currently, from Longkou in the north to Beimazhaoyuantou in the south, trenches have been dug everywhere in preparation for resistance. Liu's reinforcements have been transported to the front line as much as possible, so a large army has gathered in the Longkou area, and the people's grain has been requisitioned, causing panic among the residents. A major battle is imminent. Liu's troops have also levied huge sums from various counties in the name of raising military funds. The two small counties of Wendeng and Rongcheng have been allocated as much as 250,000 yuan each. It can be inferred from this the amount levied on other counties. The militia and civil defense forces in various counties, unable to bear the harassment, have united and risen up against Liu, and have also sent telegrams to various parties requesting assistance. The text of the telegram is as follows: I, Liu Zhennian, the commander of the 21st Division of the Army, was originally the chief of staff of Fang Yongchang's army under the former Zhili-Shandong Allied Army. With the heart of a jackal and an unbridled nature, when Zhang Zongchang failed, he took advantage of the opportunity to instigate the troops to turn against Fang Yongchang and defected to the Revolutionary Army, still stationed in the Yantai and Penglai areas of Jiaodong, expanding his power and usurping political power. In the past, the Central Government repeatedly dispatched the division to set out for battle, but the commander of the division made many excuses and did not leave the defense area. His intention was to monopolize Jiaodong and permanently maintain his position. Therefore, the heads of the various counties and other officials within the division's defense zone are all appointed by the division commander, and the provincial government cannot intervene. All grain taxes and other funds in the various counties are levied and extorted by the division commander, not collected in accordance with the regulations of the Central Government, and each county is additionally levied a monthly military supply fee of 80,000 to 120,000 yuan. It is estimated that each county collects at least 2 million yuan per year. The division occupies more than a dozen counties, and a total of more than 24 million yuan of military expenses are collected each year, which is truly shocking. Although there are occasional cases where the people of the various counties, unable to bear the extortion, rise up to resist, the commander of the division adds the crime of counter-revolution or the crime of plotting against the Red Spear Society, and arbitrarily slaughters them. Therefore, the people dare not disobey any longer. The division commander covers the sky with one hand, forcing the people's organizations to distribute telegrams of praise and virtue, and establishing newspapers to publicize his merits. Therefore, the weak people under the slaughter submit and obey, listening to his arbitrary exploitation. Jiaodong is a rich and abundant area of Shandong Province, with grain reserves in every family and savings in every household. After being exploited by Liu Zhennian for five years, the fat has been exhausted and the blood has been drained. Many middle and lower-class households have abandoned their properties and fled, and even the upper-class households have been forced to abandon their homes and seek refuge. They have repeatedly pleaded with the Central Government and the provincial government for rescue, but they have been ignored. Millions of people cannot ask for death and cannot survive. The rich area has become a desolate market, and the prosperous merchants and farmers have become fish in a dried-up ditch. It is truly a strange calamity unprecedented in ancient times. The people have no way to call for help, and their wealth is exhausted. They have no choice but to unite and hand their heads over to the vicious and evil Liu Zhennian, preferring to be ghosts who die by bullets rather than souls who starve to death. Seeking life in death, there may be a glimmer of hope. In addition to risking our lives with Liu Zhennian, we respectfully submit a tearful appeal, begging for assistance. This is our utmost hope. In tears, the representatives of millions of refugees in the thirteen counties of Jiaodong, Li Lizhou and others, kowtow together. (21st)</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the September 18th Incident in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>▲ The 19th Route Army Pastes Anti-Japanese Slogans Everywhere</p>
<p>▲ Taiwanese Cigarette Seller Fang Shengtau Actually Yields</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: For the first anniversary of the September 18th National Humiliation Day, the Fujian Provincial Party Headquarters and the 19th Route Army originally planned to hold a mass rally at the public stadium and organize propaganda teams to go to the countryside to give speeches, in order to arouse the people's spirit. However, because the provincial government did not agree due to the serious diplomatic situation, the provincial party headquarters temporarily changed the meeting to a representative assembly of all circles in the headquarters auditorium. The 19th Route Army still convened its officers and soldiers from the First Supplementary Brigade to hold a meeting at the public stadium on its own. The public who wanted to participate were also welcome. At the same time, the various regiments and battalions of the brigade posted slogans throughout the city, such as "Swear to Avenge the National Humiliation," "Recover the Lost Territories," and "Implement Economic Boycott." For more than eight months, no anti-Japanese slogans had been seen in Fuzhou society (the anti-Japanese slogans posted previously were washed away by the provincial government in early January of this year due to protests from the Japanese consulate). Suddenly seeing them again, the atmosphere became tense. On the morning of the 17th, the masses in the Xiadu area, because a certain Mr. Jia, a native of Fuqing County, rented a foreign license from a Taiwanese to open a smoking den, with lights on inside and people gathering to smoke, and selling Haelian fish, banana fruit and Lu outside, with smokers coming and going all night long, and fighting and disturbing the neighborhood late at night, negotiated with him, but the Fuqing man held the power of the foreign license and was unreasonable, arousing public anger. The masses only poured the Haelian fish, banana fruit, and Lu arranged in front of the store into the center of the street. The Fuqing man went to report to the Taiwanese, who reported to the Japanese consulate. The Japanese consul, Mr. Moriya, immediately protested to the provincial government, saying that the Chinese had gathered to destroy a Japanese merchant's foreign firm in memory of September 18, causing losses of more than 7,000 yuan. If the Chinese government had no solution, he would send marines ashore to stand guard and protect the area around Cangqianshan Fanchuanpu. His words were extremely stern. Residents around Qiaonan were greatly alarmed upon hearing the news. Tan Qixiu, the brigade commander of the Supplementary Brigade of the 19th Route Army, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched armed troops in the afternoon to set up posts around Cangqianshan Fanchuanpu to protect the area and announced martial law. Fang Shengtau, the acting chairman of the provincial government, upon hearing that the 19th Route Army had gone to Qiaonan, fearing a conflict with the Japanese marines, immediately acknowledged the Japanese consul's request, compensated 7,000 yuan, and asked the Japanese marines not to land. On the evening of the 17th, another report was received, saying that the Japanese would gather more than 200 Japanese and Taiwanese ruffians to provoke trouble when the Chinese held meetings and parades. On the morning of the 18th, Brigade Commander Tan again sent troops to set up posts in various important places, and the Public Security Bureau also ordered the entire security team to go out on patrol. At 11:00, the National Humiliation Day Commemoration Meeting opened at the stadium, with more than 2,000 soldiers and more than 1,000 civilians attending. Tan Qixiu served as chairman, and his speech was extremely impassioned. After the meeting, at about 1:00 in the afternoon, a parade set out. The civilians were in the center, and the soldiers were on both sides. The soldiers and civilians shouted slogans along the way, circling the city for a week before returning to the stadium to dismiss the team. The troops did not withdraw their sentries and lift martial law until the evening. (September 19)</p>
<h3>The Aftermath of the Bandit Areas in Western Anhui Is Underway</h3>
<p>▲ Jinjiazhai Is Being Changed to a County Seat and Will Be Implemented</p>
<p>▲ The Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Accompany Various Armies in Handling the Aftermath</p>
<p>▲ The Department of Finance Formulates Measures to Reduce and Exempt Land Taxes</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The bandit atmosphere in Anhui Province has recently gradually subsided. Jinjiazhai, which belongs to Liu'an County, has long been occupied by bandits as a nest. Now, according to a telegram from Hankou, the provincial government has learned that Wei Lihuang's troops recovered Jinjiazhai on the 20th and captured countless bandits. The 33rd Brigade was ordered to pay attention to blocking and attacking the scattered bandits, and the chief magistrate of Liu'an and the committee members accompanying the army to handle the aftermath were ordered to properly prepare for the local aftermath. The change of Jinjiazhai to a county seat has been rumored for a long time. Recently, Commander-in-Chief Chiang also plans to establish a county in the area, naming it Xinning, under the jurisdiction of Anhui. Now that it has been recovered, its realization should not be far away. In addition, Yingshan in Anhui has suffered from bandit disasters for a long time. Recently, it was ordered by Chiang via telegram to be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Third Administrative Region of Hubei. The provincial government has submitted this to the previous Standing Committee for resolution and compliance, and</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>has consulted with the Hubei Provincial Government to determine the date of transfer. These are all important measures for the aftermath in western Anhui. However, the provincial government previously appointed Tang Qiyao as the special commissioner for the aftermath of the seven counties of western Anhui, namely Liu'an, Yingshan, Huoshan, Huoqiu, Shouxian, Shucheng, and Hefei, which had been repeatedly ravaged by bandits. Recently, Tang resigned due to illness, and the provincial government changed the appointment to Wang Zhuren, the chief magistrate of Hefei, to concurrently serve as the acting commissioner. All facilities in the bandit areas can be gradually implemented, and Provincial Councilor Zhang Haizhou was sent to Wang Jun's troops, Provincial Councilor Jiang Yi was sent to Xu Tingyao's troops, and Provincial Councilor Tang Guangji was sent to Liang Guanying's troops to serve as committee members accompanying the army to handle the aftermath. They have already departed separately. In addition, the provincial government, in accordance with the telegram order from the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Bandit Suppression Headquarters to investigate and verify the regular and additional taxes in the bandit-stricken areas and exempt them separately, forwarded the order to the Department of Finance for compliance. The Department of Finance has now formulated measures to reduce and exempt regular and additional taxes, dividing them into four categories: full exemption, reduction and exemption, discretionary levy, and deferred levy. The Liu'an Chief County Government was first ordered to conduct a detailed investigation in the villages and fortresses of Yingshan, Huoshan, and other counties, report the results for verification, and then submit a report to the provincial government for forwarding to the headquarters.

<h3>The Ministry of Interior Announces Measures to Prohibit Slavery and the Keeping of Maids</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Interior previously considered that slavery and the keeping of maids were inhumane and drafted measures to prohibit them, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. The case has now been approved by the Executive Yuan's directive, and the Ministry yesterday specifically announced it with a ministry order, the full text of which is as follows: (1) All slaves and maids who are not in an employment relationship, regardless of whether they are kept through buying, selling, gifting, or charitable relations, are prohibited in accordance with these measures. (2) The steps to prohibit slavery and the keeping of maids are as follows: 1. Persuasion; 2. Liberation; 3. Relief; 4. Punishment. The preceding steps shall be handled separately in accordance with the following articles. (3) Each directly subordinate municipal government and each city and county government subordinate to the province shall supervise the police organs to conduct thorough investigations. If any slavery or maid-keeping is discovered, the relevant city and county government must be immediately reported and persuasion implemented. In the capital or public security bureaus directly subordinate to the province, it may be directly executed by the respective police organs. (4) Those who keep slaves and maids must, after being persuaded, liberate their keeping relationship within a certain period. If they wish to continue using them, they should all be changed to employment, and wages should be given appropriately. The employed and the employer both have the freedom to terminate the employment relationship at any time. (5) If each city and county liberates a large number of slaves and maids at the same time, and the employment relationship cannot be established for a while, the following methods shall be used for relief: (1) Unmarried slaves and maids who have a home</p>
<p>to return to should be sent home. If there is no home to return to, or if the family is unable to support them and is unwilling to take them in, they should be sent to the local relief center for adoption. If there is no relief center, the local government shall find ways to send them to charitable organizations for nurturing. (2) Slaves and maids who have reached adulthood, regardless of gender, must be allowed to choose their own spouses and find other jobs. If there is no suitable spouse for a while and there is a danger of unemployment and starvation, the local government may appropriately send them to a relief center or charitable organization for placement. (6) Those who keep slaves and maids, after being persuaded and given a deadline to liberate them, still fail to comply, or newly keep them after the announcement of these measures, the city and county governments shall, in addition to sending them to the judicial organs for handling in accordance with Article 313 of the Criminal Law for the crime of enslaving people, and immediately forcibly liberating the slaves and maids they are keeping.</p>
<p>, and may also impose a fine of up to 300 yuan, which shall be used by the local relief center or other charitable organization to relieve unemployed slaves and maids. (7) The city and county governments subordinate to each provincial government and the directly subordinate public security bureaus shall, within three months of receiving these measures, submit the handling situation to the provincial government for forwarding to the Ministry of Interior for verification. The handling situation of the directly subordinate municipal governments and the capital police department shall be directly reported to the Ministry of Interior for verification. (8) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval and promulgation.</p>
<h3>Journey to the West (20) (IV)</h3>
<p>Extending Amidst Eight Scenic Spots</p>
<p>On August 1st, in addition to inspecting the oil factory, we also investigated various local conditions. We learned that the entire county of Yanchang has a population of 21,000 people, with more than 3,600 households, and an area of approximately 4,500 acres. The city walls were built on high mountains, seemingly paying considerable attention to the defense against bandits. The only street with a market is a main road. Commerce is bleak, and the scene is desolate. Residents all express that taxes are too heavy and that it is almost impossible to make a living. Almost the entire county is mountainous, with very little flat land. The flat land along both sides of the Yan River and at the top of the mountains is slightly fertile and can be used to grow cotton and wheat. The flat land at the top of the mountains can yield two dou of wheat per mu (each dou is 50 catties), and the hillside land can yield one dou. In terms of the entire county, the land planted with cotton accounts for about one-tenth, cultivated land accounts for seven-tenths, and wasteland accounts for three-tenths. The annual land tax is about 6,000 yuan. In addition, there are miscellaneous taxes or surcharges. On average, each person can cultivate about 30 mu of land.</p>
<p>In terms of scenery, there is Phoenix Ridge 30 li west of the city, and Yongyi Bridge near the south of the city, which is said to be a naturally formed bridge. Originally, there were six arches, but now there are only two. Near the east of the city is Suyu Spring, where the water is fragrant and drinking it can refresh the lungs. The Yan River (also known as Zhai River) meanders along the side, resembling a divine dragon winding through the green mountains. When I walked to Yan, I washed my hands and feet in it several times. Although the water is deep, it still makes people want to linger. Other scenic spots include Huadong West Cliff 3 li west of the city, Zhongping South Barrier 1 li south of the city, Douji Xiaoyue 40 li west of the city, Phoenix Ridge Qinglan east of the city gate, Jiuquan Tianniang behind the Confucian temple, Oil Well Boyong outside the west gate city railing, Suyuyu Waterfall 1 li east of the city, and Jiu Lian Chuanzhu 15 li west of the city. Eight beautiful landscapes surround Yanchang. Although Yan is small, it is enough to be proud of. Residents outside the city mostly live in kilns. Those living in the plains mostly live in stone kilns, and those living on the mountain tops mostly live in earth kilns. About one-third of the clothes are made of local cloth, and one-third are made of cloth from Shanxi. Most of the drinking water is spring water, and residents on the mountain tops mostly store water in kilns for emergencies. The Yan River still has no strange taste, and residents mostly use it for washing. About 50 li west of the city is Black Drum Heap (an earth mountain) with a grove of cypress trees, covering about 10 mu. About 2 li west of the city along the Yan River is Silin Ping, which can irrigate about 300 to 400 mu, greatly benefiting the farmers.</p>
<p>The entire county has three senior elementary schools (including one girls' school), with a total of 120 students, of which only 10 are girls. There are 22 junior elementary schools, with a total of about 300 students, of which 30 to 40 are girls. There is one people's school with about 10 students. Teachers' monthly salaries are about 10 yuan or more. The annual education expenses for junior elementary schools are about 3,000 yuan, which are raised by the Education Bureau. Senior elementary schools have a fund of 4,000 yuan, with an annual interest of 800 to 900 yuan. In addition to temporary solutions, the annual cost of people's education is about 1,400 yuan, and the annual education administrative expenses are about 800 yuan. In addition, 450 yuan of the annual interest of 1,500 yuan is used as an annual subsidy for further education. Those sent to Peking for study are about three people, those studying in Shanxi are three people (female students),</p>
<p>one is at the Central Military Academy. In addition, some people are sent to Yulin, Xi'an, and other places to study higher knowledge.</p>
<p>Coal from the kiln costs about 3 jiao per 100 catties, and the market price is about 7 jiao per 100 catties. Oil</p>
<p>costs about 2 jiao 5 fen per catty. The atmosphere seems more open-minded than in other places. A considerable number of young girls have cut their hair and do not bind their feet.</p>
<p>One evening, all circles in Yanchang held a welcome meeting at the County First Senior Elementary School. I did not attend due to a cold. Many members of the delegation have been suffering from minor ailments recently, so we planned to rest for another day on the 2nd. On the morning of the 3rd, we started to turn south and head towards Yichuan. (Sent from Yanchang on September 2nd)</p>
<h3>▲ Mood Swings Again</h3>
<p>On our second day in Yanchang, September 2nd, although the morning sun still sang brightly to the distant guests, the crimson sunlight still shone all over the earth, and the donkeys and horses tied to the wasteland still moaned mournfully, the mountains were still green, and the water still flowed, this day of leisure aroused our infinite homesickness. Although all of our environment was the same, most of us naturally felt a burning desire to return home. Everything in front of us seemed to have changed rapidly. Although some of us had wireless radios, we could not receive any news due to the high mountains separating us. So, troubles came, depression arose, and the peaceful minds that had been like ancient wells were now having mood swings again.</p>
<p>Because the exploration of Yanchang's oil had been completed on the first day, we felt that we had nothing to do on the second day. In the morning, flies were flying around the room, which was very rampant. They disturbed us so that we could not eat or sleep peacefully. So, we found three or four fly swatters and launched a war against them. As a result, of course, the people were victorious. About a thousand flies died, their corpses littered the ground, and their ability to harass was temporarily suppressed. In the afternoon, we went to the Yan River outside the city to bathe in the torrent. The water was clear and cool, and we felt very happy after bathing. In the evening, everyone wanted to hold a pastime meeting, but it was unsuccessful. In about eighteen days after we set off, this day was the most boring and the most incredible.</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence Songjiang</h3>
<p>▲ Telegrams Contend for Honest Collection of Land Survey Fees This county previously received a provincial order to levy land survey funds at 1 jiao per mu, with less than 1 mu calculated as 1 mu. It was requested at the administrative meeting that it be reduced to 5 fen to meet the 1% limit, but it was not approved. An order was issued to issue separate receipts for collection. However, the local people believe that charging for less than 1 mu as 1 mu increases the burden and have requested the provincial department to collect honestly in accordance with the land price tax collection regulations. The following is a telegram from citizen Wu Weihe and others to the provincial government, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Construction: (Having been ordered to collect land survey fees at 1 jiao per mu, with less than 1 mu counted as 1 mu, and earnestly instructed that if there is extra collection, they will be allowed to sue at any time, etc., which is inexplicably frightening. Checking the land price tax collection of mu donations, all are collected honestly according to the number of mu completed, and there has never been an example of rounding up and adding a burden to the people. Moreover, the amount of the printed strings is mostly odd numbers. If they are all rounded up, it will inevitably be like draining the pond to catch the fish and lose the principle of equal tax burden. As for the entire county of Song, the amount of tax strings reaches more than 200,000 per period. How many are odd numbers and how many are integers? It is difficult to collect if you do not collect statistics, and it is easy to open up the gradual trend of bribery among tax collectors. And knowing Qingyi's method, 9 jiao and 1 fen of land survey fees are collected for every two taels of silver, which are also collected honestly according to the number of mu, which is very clear. Rounding up in Songyi seems to lose equality and violates the purpose of not allowing extra collection. We respectfully ask your seat to think about the people's suffering and still follow the established case of collection and collect honestly according to the number of mu completed for each string, so as to prevent all malpractices, etc.) Now there are many who continue to request. I think the provincial department will be able to comply with the people's wishes.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>▲A Woman Gives Birth to Triplets. Mrs. Zhu Lu, residing at No. 18 Xihui outside Qimen, is 27 years old this year. Her husband works as a clerk in a pawnshop. Recently, she became pregnant and had not given birth for a long time, and her abdomen was unusually large. She went to the Tianci Zhuang Boxi Hospital to await delivery. At 10 a.m. yesterday (the 22nd), she suddenly gave birth to triplets. Both mother and children are currently safe.</p>
<p>▲Lü Ziwen's Three Suicide Notes. Lü Ziwen, the 21-year-old daughter of Shanghai merchant Lü Shenfu, married Yuan Junli, a wealthy man at No. 38 Daxin Bridge outside Panmen, Suzhou, last September. Because Yuan's family affairs were managed by the late husband's widowed daughter-in-law, Tong Baozhen, Ms. Lü was forced to commit suicide. Yesterday (the 23rd), the deceased's family discovered wounds on her arm and requested the court to conduct a re-examination, hoping to punish the ungrateful husband and stepmother according to the law to redress this strange injustice. Ms. Lü left many suicide notes and diaries, excerpts of which are as follows: (1) To her parents: "Yesterday (the 19th), Junli forced me to write a note, and Baozhen forced me to say certain things. In the evening, they wanted me to write another note, but I refused, so they beat my hands and legs. My heart is so pained. Junli said he wouldn't stop until I wrote it, otherwise he would beat me every day until I couldn't live in peace. As for the previous time I wanted to have a medical examination, Junli said if you go for an examination, I will first publish a divorce notice. Alas, my parents, your daughter really cannot continue to be wrong. Farewell, please take care." (2) To her husband, Yuan Junli: "You said I have lost my virginity, but I have not. I said I would go with you for an examination, but you refused. You forced me to write a note, or you would divorce me. Because I cannot explain clearly, I can only die, awaiting official examination." (3) To all circles: "My husband said I am unchaste, hence my suicide. Please kind-hearted gentlemen, retrieve my body and ask the officials for an examination," etc. As for her diary, it describes the family situation, mostly about how her husband Junli and stepmother conspired to abuse her, and Junli's indifference towards her.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲The Construction Bureau Hastens the Construction of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway. Among the roads in Jiangsu Province and its counties that have been built, in addition to the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, there are the Beijing-Zhenjiang-Wuxi-Changzhou Provincial Highway, and the Wuxi-Chengjiang, Wuxi-Yi, Wuxi-Yi county roads. The local county's highway, starting from the starting point of the Wuxi-Changzhou Provincial Highway, can now directly reach the capital and connect with the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. However, the Shanghai-Wuxi Provincial Highway from Wuxi to Shanghai has not yet been realized due to limited funding. Recently, the Military Affairs Commission believes that the construction of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway is urgently needed, so it has specifically instructed the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Bureau to start construction immediately and complete it within the shortest possible time, so that the Wuxi-Changzhou Provincial Highway can directly reach the capital. Director Dong Xiu-jia, after receiving the order, has now made proper plans and specially dispatched Zhang Jingming, a technical officer of the bureau, to lead surveyors to begin surveying. Mr. Zhang, upon receiving the order, departed for Wuxi to investigate the starting point of the highway. It is stipulated that the section from Wuxi to Suzhou will follow the original road along the embankment and widen it, while the section from Suzhou to Shanghai will need to open up a new road along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. It is said that the survey period will take about one month before it can be completed, and then bidding for construction will be invited.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>▲Capture of Robbers in the Central Bank Robbery Case. The Investigation Department of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, having learned that the Central Bank robbers had fled to Dagang Town, secretly dispatched several officers and two squads of soldiers to Dagang Town, where they captured the four main criminals in their den. They were then strictly escorted to Zhenjiang to rest in the Wuzhou Hotel and were taken to the capital for interrogation by the 9 p.m. train.</p>
<p>▲Implementation of Factory Registration. In March of this year, the Ministry of Industry promulgated factory registration rules. The Department of Industry immediately issued a notice to all counties, instructing all factories to comply. Now, factories in various counties are submitting factory registrations in accordance with the rules, including: Wu County Dachina Match Co., Ltd., Suzhou Hongsheng Factory, Nanhui County Dachina Match Co., Ltd., Zhoupu Zhonghua Factory, Haimen County Dasheng No. 3 Textile Company, Jurong County China Cement Co., Ltd., Baoying County Civilian Arts and Crafts Factory, Ganqiang County Ganxing Match Factory, etc. The remaining counties are being urged to register separately.</p>

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>▲Water Police Ordered to Monitor Fishing Protection Team. The Fisheries Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industry previously established an office in Nantong, ordering fishermen to register and collect license fees, and also dispatched a fishing protection team and the Qing'an warship to be stationed in Yaogang. Currently, the Fourth District Department of the Water Police, upon the order of the Civil Affairs Department, believes that Nantong City is not a fishing area, and there is no need to set up an office. Furthermore, it is rumored that the Qing'an warship has engaged in improper behavior on the harbor surface. District Chief Zhang is ordered to send a team to monitor the actions of the fishing protection team. The department also dispatched the Junhe warship to Nantong to assist in handling the matter. The Junhe warship arrived in Yaogang on the 22nd. District Chief Zhang of the Water Police immediately sent personnel to the Fisheries Administration Bureau office at noon on the 22nd, requesting them to comply with the department's order to withdraw. At the same time, a team was sent to Yaogang to jointly monitor the actions of the Qing'an warship with the Junhe warship and ordered it to return to Nanjing immediately.</p>
<p>▲Fourth Prison to Expand Housing. Sun, the warden of the Nantong Fourth Prison, believes that due to the increasing number of prisoners, expansion is necessary. He previously formulated a plan requiring 20,000 yuan and submitted it to the Higher Court for review. Warden Sun also personally went to the Zhenjiang Finance Department and the Suzhou Higher Court a few days ago to discuss the matter. The results were quite satisfactory. The Higher Court agreed to allocate half of the expansion funds, and the remaining 10,000 yuan will be raised locally through donations. As for the prisoner rations after the expansion, Director Shu of the Finance Department also agreed to increase the number from 300 to 400. Warden Sun returned to Nantong on the 22nd and is currently planning to raise donations and invite bids for construction.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>▲Middle and Primary School Principals Petition the County Government. Due to tax revenue shortages, the education funds in Jiaxing are insufficient to cover expenditures. Qiu Shouchi, the Director of the Finance Bureau, is also unable to assume the responsibility of raising funds. Therefore, salaries have been in arrears for many months. On the 22nd, the principals, together with the district education officers, petitioned the County Magistrate and the Director of the Finance Bureau. County Magistrate Jiang promised to discuss the matter further at the county government meeting. All the principals stated that if there is no solution, they will jointly submit their resignations.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>▲Murder of Husband Case Returned to Original County for Execution. In June, Cao Cai of Shicun outside the South Gate of Xiaoshan, a merchant, was murdered by his wife, Cao Cai, who colluded with her lover, Xu Arong, to cut off Cao Caisheng's genitals. After the criminal was apprehended, the Xiaoshan County Court sentenced her to death. Cao Cai was not satisfied and appealed. Now, the third trial has concluded, and the death sentence has been upheld. After the Higher Court presented the case to the provincial government for approval, the criminal was returned to her place of origin to be executed by hanging and shooting soon.</p>
<p>▲Tragic News of Two Children Burned to Death in a Fire in Xixiang. The home of Sun Youxing, a resident of Zhengjiahu in Xixiang, Xiaoshan, caught fire at night on the 20th due to carelessness with fire in the kitchen. The fire quickly spread to three two-story buildings, five thatched houses, and two single-story buildings, and tragically burned to death a three-year-old boy and a five-year-old girl. Other losses of miscellaneous items, rice, etc., are estimated to be worth over 5,000 yuan.</p>

Despite strenuous rescue efforts, three people are still missing and presumed drowned. On the same day, a general merchandise boat near Xixing shore was also hit by the tide and sank. All the cloth and paper goods, worth about 8,000 to 9,000 yuan, sank to the bottom of the river. Four boatmen fell into the water, and one drowned.</p>

<h3>Teachers from Chinese Schools in British Malaya Expelled and Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In recent years, the British Malaya has severely suppressed overseas Chinese education. Various social, historical, and geographical textbooks related to criticizing foreigners in primary and secondary schools have been banned. Teachers often fear walking on thin ice. Recently, Dong Lianduo and Shen Shifang, teachers at the Pengting Guandan Overseas Chinese School, were expelled again. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Hong Kong by ship. According to them, on April 24, the Director of Studies went to the school to search and found only one paper in a student's drawer: a notice of the previous year's flood in China, in which families and students were urged to save on sweets and donate to the disaster relief fund. There was also a paper advising families to boycott Japanese goods after the September 18th Incident, an entry in a student's diary commemorating the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, and several news items about the Northeast Army's Ma Zhanshan's battles. Three songs, including the memorial song for the Premier, the Chinese Kuomintang party song, and the May 9th National Humiliation Day song, were found in a song copybook. The local government considered these to have political implications and ordered their arrest and imprisonment on May 21, forbidding bail and visits from outsiders. Photos and fingerprints were taken, and the situation was very serious. They were detained for more than ten days, handcuffed, and escorted to the prison in Lipi, the capital of Pengheng Province. They were tried in prison by the San Si Council of the Overseas Chinese Education Administration, without allowing witnesses to be heard or anyone to observe, which was even stricter than the treatment of murderers and robbers. After the trial, the charges and reasons were not announced. Later, through the rescue of the school board and the intercession of the consul stationed in Singapore with the chief of the San Si Council, they were allowed to be deported on bail. On August 18, they left on the Dejiada mail ship, with tickets directly to Shanghai. On the 23rd, when the ship arrived in Hong Kong, the police came on board and arrested them, claiming that they had committed a crime in Hong Kong. They were re-imprisoned. On the 23rd, the Hong Kong government deported them again. The case was handled by two governments, and they spent four months in prison. It was indeed tragic. All our compatriots cannot help but shed tears of sympathy for them. If we do not rise up and resist, overseas Chinese education will be in danger! (Xinsheng News Agency)</p>

<h3>Two Football Matches Today</h3>
<p>▲Lingnan vs. British Ship MANTIS</p>
<p>▲Youyou vs. Yiling Vila</p>
<p>The autumn weather is refreshing, and football is on the market. Each team is preparing their troops, hoping to show their skills in the Chinese and Western League. Therefore, after the Summer League has come to an end today, there are two friendly matches on the baseball field, with the benefit of mutual observation, as a prelude to the league.</p>
<p>Teams Time Referee</p>
<p>(1) Lingnan vs. British Ship 2:30 PM Shen Huichun</p>
<p>(2) Youyou vs. Yiling 4:00 PM He Chunhui</p>
<p>Youyou (formerly Sanyu)'s football history certainly has a long and successful record. Since Sanyu, it has participated in Chinese and Western competitions every year and has achieved considerable results. Recalling when the Chinese team joined the Western Football Association, the association president Cheng Yize negotiated with the Western association, which took a lot of effort. The Western association then allowed the Chinese team to participate in the competition, and Sanyu was the first team. This year, the team joined the Western Association's A League. People think that Youyou is old, but they do not know that this old age is a matter of history. As for the players, except for Rao Huisheng, who is over forty years old, the rest are young and strong, with a bright future. It is really immeasurable. Today's Youyou lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Lu Shifang Zhu Shengfa Rao Huisheng Sun Huipei</p>

<h3>Austrian Olympic Committee Member Departs Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>▲Committee Visited War Relics Yesterday Morning | Gave Public Speech in the Afternoon</p>
<p>▲Mayor Wu Hosted a Banquet in the Evening | Departs for Europe This Morning</p>
<p>Mr. Schmidt, an Austrian member of the World Olympic Congress, Mr. Massoli, a Swiss member, and Dr. Li Mi, a Swiss physical education professor, arrived in China for a tour. Yesterday was their second day in Shanghai. In the morning, the city government sent escorts to accompany them to visit the war relics in Zhabei and Wusong. In the afternoon, they attended a public lecture organized by the city government at the YMCA. In the evening, Mayor Wu hosted a banquet at the Xing Hua Lou restaurant and watched a performance at the Tianchan Theater. The three committee members will take the French postal ship "Athos" this morning to return to Europe by sea. The following is a record of their travels yesterday:</p>
<p>▲Visiting the War Relics of Shanghai-Songhu</p>
<p>At around 9:00 a.m., the city government sent Chen Yuze, Tian Heqing, and others to accompany the three committee members to visit Zhabei and Wusong. Austrian member Schmidt was unable to attend due to other matters, so only the two Swiss members went. They expressed unlimited sympathy to our country regarding the Japanese army's atrocities.</p>
<p>▲Public Lecture at the YMCA</p>
<p>At 1:00 p.m., the city government hosted a public lecture at the auditorium of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge. The audience was full, with over six hundred young men and women. Shen Siliang first introduced the two Austrian and Swiss members, who then delivered brief speeches as follows:</p>
<p>▲Schmidt Speaks on Austrian Sports - President of the Austrian National Amateur Sports Association, member of the World Olympic Committee, and Austrian business representative to the Geneva League of Nations, Schmidt, began by saying that his speech would be divided into three parts: (1) the state of Austrian sports, (2) Austria and the Olympics, and (3) China and the Olympics. He said that after the European War, Austria was divided, and the vast territory is now only the area between the Alps and the Danube River, with a population of six million, two million of whom live in Vienna. This small population can be considered quite large in Europe. There are a total of 23 sports associations nationwide, with 94,000 members. In Vienna, there is the Austrian National Sports Association. In general, due to geographical factors, the main types of sports can be divided into four: (1) ice skating, (2) weightlifting, (3) boxing, and (4) fencing. Other sports are also practiced. This time, they participated in the Olympics in the United States despite the country's extreme economic difficulties. The government did not donate a single penny, and all funds came from private donations, so they only sent nine athletes and three staff members. Fortunately, they did not disgrace their mission and won a women's fencing championship, a second place in weightlifting, and three third places. As for the important significance of the Olympics, it can be divided into three points: first, absolute equality on the sports field; second, separation from all political relations; and third, the noble amateur principle, not for money, but for the honor of the group they represent. Therefore, this year, in 1932, they were able to see the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun in Los Angeles, and they were all welcomed with applause. Everything is difficult at the beginning, and we deeply know the current internal and external difficulties of China, but the small number of representatives of China have done their best in Los Angeles. What is especially worth mentioning is the effort of Mr. Shen Siliang of the delegation. It is hoped that a larger delegation from China will be seen at the next Berlin Olympics. The Austrian sports community is very willing to cooperate with China and is preparing at all times to meet China's needs. Austria is a relatively advanced country in sports. If China needs talents to guide new methods in weightlifting, boxing, and fencing, Austria is very willing to contribute, and so on.</p>
<p>▲Massoli Talks About Swiss Sports - Next, Swiss Olympic Committee member Massoli spoke in French about Swiss sports, saying that Switzerland is the oldest democracy in the world, but also the smallest. The country has a population of four million, with about 25,000 sports association members. In the 13th century, due to the oppression of foreign enemies, the youth of the whole country actively promoted sports to strengthen their physique. After 200 years of training, the foundation is still deep. In terms of national relations, Switzerland and Austria had many conflicts in the past, but on the sports field, they still work hand in hand. This time, due to economic and distance reasons, very few athletes were sent to the Olympics, and nothing was gained. However, in 1928, three silver shields were won. Committee member Ma also mentioned Switzerland's contribution to culture and the motivation of the Olympics, the past sessions, and seeing China participate in this tenth session. He hoped that China could send more athletes to the next session in Berlin, and so on.</p>
<p>▲City First Stadium Performs National Arts - The Swiss Consul in Shanghai, Wu Kemoluo, also stood up to extend his warm hospitality. Finally, the City First Stadium performed various national arts, which were greatly appreciated by the committee members.</p>
<p>▲Mayor Wu Hosted a Banquet Last Night</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet at the Xing Hua Lou Restaurant at 8:00 p.m. last night to welcome the Austrian and Swiss committee members. The consuls of Austria and Switzerland in Shanghai, as well as Zhao Jinqing, Shen Siliang, Ling Xichu, and others from the sports community, attended, accompanied by Secretary Yu Hongjun of the city government and the heads of various bureaus. The banquet ended at almost 11:00 p.m., and then Mayor Wu accompanied them to the Tianchan Theater to watch a play, as the committee members greatly appreciated Chinese martial arts, saying that they have a very important place in sports. The following is a record of the speeches given during the banquet:</p>
<p>▲Mayor Wu's Speech - I welcome you all in my capacity as the Mayor of Shanghai, and I am deeply honored. Today, the politicians and diplomats of the world are thinking about and seeking to solve the question of why the world is fighting and restless. The nations of the world are fighting every day, and thus a narrow nationalism is gradually formed. The struggles of the world are becoming more intense, and the unrest in the world is becoming more serious. However, stabilizing the world is a mutual responsibility of mankind. Although what we seek may not be an ideal utopia, the World Games is one of the effective ways to connect the world, unite the world, and stabilize the world. This time in the United States, our country sent very few representatives. I sincerely hope to send a larger delegation to the next session, so as to do our best to connect the world, unite the world, and seek world peace. And what I hope more from the two committee members is to tell the people of your countries about the good impressions in China. China is a nation that loves peace. The ancient sages taught that all within the four seas are brothers. I would like to use this wine to wish you all a safe journey.</p>
<p>▲Schmidt's Reply - Austrian Committee member Schmidt stood up and gave a reply, saying that he was very grateful for the Mayor's hospitality. It is even more gratifying that the Mayor can pay attention to the relationship between the Olympic Games and world peace. However, to achieve this goal, we still need to work hard. This time, we deeply know the difficulties that China is currently experiencing. The number of representatives does not matter. I hope that more representatives can be sent to participate in the next session. As for the development of sports, it is also deeply related to the social aspect. What we sincerely hope from the Mayor is to be a good friend of our sports community.</p>
<p>The Swiss committee member also gave a brief speech, and the Swiss Consul stood up again to express his thanks. The banquet ended in a joyful atmosphere.</p>

<h3>The Association for the Advancement of Physical Culture Agrees to Raise Funds to Aid the Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association previously sent a letter to the Chinese National Association for the Advancement of Physical Culture, requesting to raise funds by collecting team games to expand the Volunteer Army's military expenditures. Yesterday, the Association for the Advancement of Physical Culture approved the letter and replied, saying, "We have received your letter, proposing to collect team games to raise funds to expand the Volunteer Army's military expenditures, so as to meet the needs of killing the enemy and serving the country. After checking this matter, since the Japanese pirates invaded our Eastern Provinces, fortunately, the Volunteer Army fought bravely and was able to resist the strong, your army feels the isolated support of the Volunteer Army and makes practical relief efforts, hoping for a long-term struggle, urgently serving the public and defending the country, which is admirable. As for your request, once a suitable method is considered, with the best of our ability, we will immediately raise funds and donate them to the Northeast Volunteer Army to meet urgent needs.

<h3>Ping Pong Championship Tournament to Donate to Volunteer Army</h3>

The income from the tickets will be entirely donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army to show a little effort. Recently, ticket purchases have been very enthusiastic, which shows that people's hearts are not dead and revenge is expected. I hope that our other sports will also take the opportunity to rise up and provide assistance, so that it will not be difficult to gather strength. The teams that have already registered to participate in the competition include Hongle, Chenzhong, Lele, Huqing, Hongzhang, Taole, and Daxia.</p>

<h3>Northeast Customs Relocates Tax Collection</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Song Issues Declaration and Speaks Yesterday</p>
<p>Unable to Collect Due to Rebel Seizure</p>
<p>Detailed Measures to be Announced Today</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Regarding the issue of blockading the Northeast customs, the 66th meeting of the Executive Yuan yesterday approved the relocation of tax collection. The detailed measures will be announced today by the Customs Commissioners of various customs. Finance Minister Song Ziwen summoned General Customs Commissioner Merleau and Jianghai Customs Supervisor Tang Haian at his residence in Shanghai yesterday morning and gave instructions on this issue. Minister Song also issued a declaration and a formal speech, which are specially recorded on the left:</p>
<p>▲Declaration The so-called "Foreign Minister of Manchuria" Xie Jieshi declared on September 15 that "Manchuria" will completely regard China as a foreign country in terms of customs, commerce, shipping, and even all other matters, and claimed that from September 25, all goods coming and going between China and "Manchuria" will begin to be levied import and export taxes. Therefore, the National Government instructed the Ministry of Finance that since the Chinese Customs is currently unable to collect legal customs duties at various ports in the three eastern provinces, it should close the Northeast customs for future orders. All customs duties to be levied should be temporarily levied at the customs south of the Great Wall to the extent possible. The detailed announcements are being issued separately by the Customs Commissioners of various ports.</p>
<p>▲Speech - The Japanese, under the guise of the "Manchurian authorities," began to seize the Northeast customs this spring, and in June, they forcibly occupied the Dalian customs. During this period, the National Government always expressed extreme tolerance and did not change the usual practice of transporting domestic products between the Northeast and other parts of China. At the same time, for foreign goods shipped from the three eastern provinces to other ports in China that had already been taxed, no additional taxes were levied. Because the three eastern provinces are Chinese territory, and 96% of its residents are Chinese people, if the government takes hostile actions against the Northeast, the result will only make the local Chinese residents suffer. Therefore, although the government was strongly urged by public opinion, it did not take any retaliatory measures, preferring to endure temporary tax revenue shortages rather than automatically starting to divide the three eastern provinces from other parts of China. In addition, the National Government, because the League of Nations Investigation Team was conducting an investigation, and at the same time, for the League of Nations' resolution to urge China and Japan to avoid any actions that would increase the severity of the situation, still paid attention to force under many provocative actions by Japan. This is also one of the reasons why the government had to take a tolerant policy. Now Japan, with the so-called "Foreign Minister of Manchuria" as its spokesperson, declares that it will disregard all international treaties, all international conventions, and all economic laws, and create a customs barrier between the three eastern provinces and other ports in China, so that the three eastern provinces will be isolated from other parts of China not only politically but also economically. This move by Japan is tantamount to forcing the 30 million Chinese people outside the customs to be permanently separated from their 370 million compatriots inside the customs. Not only that, but the so-called "Vice Foreign Minister of Manchuria" Japanese Ohashi Chuichi stated on September 16 that "Manchuria" will not allow inland opening except for the nationals of countries that recognize "Manchuria" and at the same time allow them to abandon consular jurisdiction, and will give them various benefits of residence, investment, or lease. Ohashi's remarks are tantamount to saying that the opening of the door to the three eastern provinces will change from opening to all powers and even to China itself to closing the door, and the only country that can enjoy the benefits of opening is Japan. However, although this kind of provocative behavior by Japan is unprecedented in history, the National Government will still not take retaliatory measures at present. What is being taken now is only a simple method to collect the customs duties that should have been collected at the Northeast customs at the customs outside the Northeast to the extent possible. Because China's interests in the three eastern provinces are far greater than Japan's interests in the three eastern provinces due to population and investment. If the government takes any action at this time to increase the difficulty of economic relations between the three eastern provinces and other parts of China, it would be something that the Japanese have been eagerly hoping for.</p>
<p>▲Measures - Yesterday, the General Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs in Shanghai received an order from the government to close the customs of Harbin, Niuzhuang, Andong, and Longjingcun on September 25, and recorded the measures for the import and export of goods to the above ports after the closure. (Our government, due to the Japanese occupation of our three eastern provinces, the National Government cannot temporarily collect legal customs duties at the ports of the three eastern provinces, and has ordered the customs of Harbin, Niuzhuang, Andong, and Longjingcun to be closed on September 25. All legal customs duties to be levied at the above-mentioned customs will be temporarily levied at other ports in the Republic of China. The tax collection measures for goods shipped to the above-mentioned ports in the three eastern provinces are as follows: (Domestic goods) (including factory-made goods) as before; (Foreign goods) those who have been given a license to exempt from re-levying and have stated that the import tax has been paid (as before), those who have always stated that the word "to be levied" should be paid at the port of shipment, and those who have always paid the transit goods at the port of arrival (pay the import tax at the port of transfer); (goods withdrawn from the customs warehouse,) pay the import tax at the port of shipment. The tax collection measures for goods shipped from the above-mentioned ports in the three eastern provinces are as follows: (Domestic goods) pay the transit tax and the transit tax surcharge; (Factory-made goods) the factory-made goods tax and surcharge usually levied at the ports of the three eastern provinces are all levied at the port of import; (Foreign goods) the import tax is levied. In the Dalian leased territory, because the Japanese authorities violated the agreement and refused to allow the Chinese Customs to exercise its functions in accordance with the Dalian Agreement, the customs cannot determine the source and destination of goods entering and leaving Dalian. Therefore, the tax collection measures are as follows: Goods shipped to Dalian, (Local goods) levy export tax (Factory goods) levy factory goods tax regardless of their final destination, (Foreign goods) the tax collection measures are the same as those for shipping to other ports in the three eastern provinces (see above). (Goods shipped from Dalian) All goods are subject to import tax, customs surcharges, and flood relief surcharges. All customs documents for goods shipped to the above-mentioned ports should be directly handed over to the shipper for collection. From September 25 of this year, all kinds of documents issued by the above-mentioned ports will be invalid. All transit foreign goods directly shipped from overseas to the ports of the three eastern provinces that do not leave the original ship in transit do not need to be taxed, or all transit domestic goods directly shipped from the ports of the three eastern provinces to overseas that do not leave the original ship in transit are also not taxed. From September 25 of this year, the tonnage certificates issued by the above-mentioned ports in the three eastern provinces will also be invalid.</p>

<h3>Dockworkers Refused to Organize Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Union Organizer Suddenly Attacked with a Blade</p>
<p>▲ Seven Arrested and Sent to Bureau for Interrogation</p>
<p>Dagong News reports: Since the Municipal Party Headquarters withdrew the former dockworker reorganization committee members and appointed new members to be responsible for reorganization, a small number of dockworkers deliberately obstructed the handover yesterday, resulting in a riot. The new organizers, Liu Defu and Xu Jianye, were attacked with axes and injured. They also created a disturbance at the Municipal Party Headquarters. The Public Security Bureau sent police to suppress the riot, resulting in the arrest of seven people. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Reason for Committee Removal: The former dockworkers' union reorganization committee was removed because the committee members were scattered and no one was in charge, resulting in the virtual suspension of union affairs. Disputes among workers arose from time to time. The Municipal Party Headquarters, in view of this, ordered a reorganization, withdrawing the old reorganization committee and appointing Liu Defu and eleven others as reorganization committee members to begin the reorganization.</p>
<p>▲ Handover Process: Since the Municipal Party Headquarters appointed new committee members to be responsible for the reorganization, the two sides agreed that the handover of documents and seals would take place at the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday, the 23rd. Therefore, the committee members from both sides met in the conference room of the Municipal Party Headquarters at 2 p.m. yesterday to hand over the documents and seals. The former standing committee members of the dockworker reorganization committee, Shen Wenyuan and Wu Jiazhe, paid off all outstanding wages and expenses owed to the former members of the dockworker reorganization committee.</p>
<p>▲ Former Committee Members' Withdrawal: After the former reorganization committee members Shen Wenyuan, Wu Jiazhe, Gan Xinmin, and others handed over all documents and seals, they declared their willingness to withdraw from the dockworker reorganization committee and published a statement to clear their procedures. The statement is recorded as follows: (Shen Wenyuan's statement) To whom it may concern: I was previously appointed by the Municipal Party Headquarters as a standing committee member and general affairs officer of the Shanghai Dockworkers' Union Reorganization Committee. Due to the January 28th Incident, the monthly fees from Japanese-owned docks were suspended, resulting in a large accumulation of arrears in salaries for union staff and all expenses. Now, the Municipal Party Headquarters has ordered me to find a solution. I have recently raised funds from various docks and have paid off all staff and debtors in full on September 23rd at the Municipal Party Headquarters. At the same time, I have submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters to resign from all positions. I will not be responsible for any matters related to the union after this. I am publishing this statement to clarify the situation. (Wu Jiazhe and others' statement) To whom it may concern: We were previously members of the dockworkers' union reorganization committee. The committee members have now been re-appointed by the Municipal Party Headquarters. All union affairs documents and assets of the former dockworkers' union committee have been handed over clearly on September 22nd. All accounts during our tenure have been cleared and are not related to the new committee members. Outstanding salaries for staff have also been paid off. We are withdrawing from the dockworker reorganization committee from the date of this announcement. We will not be responsible for any matters related to the union after this. Former standing committee member of the dockworker reorganization committee, Wu Jiazhe; reorganization committee members Gan Xinmin, Liu Defu, Huang Xianggu, Huang Zaoxiong, Zhang Sheng.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives Attacked: Yesterday, while the committee members from both sides were handing over documents and seals at the Municipal Party Headquarters, new committee members Liu Defu and Xu Jianye, accompanied by Municipal Party Headquarters supervisors Zhong Quan and Zhang Sheng, went to the former dockworker reorganization committee in Xiaojiuhua, Nanshi, to take over equipment. Unexpectedly, dozens of workers had been lying in wait inside the building. When they saw Liu and the others arrive, they closed the door and attacked Liu and the others with prepared iron rods and axes. Liu and Xu were immediately knocked to the ground, bleeding profusely. The representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters were also slightly injured and rushed out of the door in a hurry. They reported to the Municipal Party Headquarters by telephone through the Social Affairs Bureau. The injured Liu Defu and Xu Jianye were ordered by the Xiaojiuhua police station of the first district and third precinct to be sent to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the two men suffered axe wounds to their heads and hands and were seriously injured.</p>
<p>▲ Petition Riot: After attacking the takeover representatives, the workers took four workers who were injured in the infighting during the attack to the Municipal Party Headquarters by car and held a collective petition. Unexpectedly, after arriving at the Municipal Party Headquarters, the workers closed the gate without asking for any explanation and rushed into the office, attacking anyone they saw. Zhong Quan, Li Weitai, Zhang Sheng, and other staff members of the department were injured. At that time, the gatekeeper stationed at the Municipal Party Headquarters, seeing the workers rioting, went to dissuade them. Unexpectedly, the leading workers Wu Mingfu, Zhou Hanqing, and others suddenly seized the pistol carried by the police officer. Because the police officer's strength was stronger, they failed to snatch it away. The workers then moved the trigger with their fingers, and two shots were fired immediately. Fortunately, the muzzle was pointing downwards, so no one was injured. In the midst of the chaos, Jin Tian, the director of the second district public security bureau, received the report and immediately led a large number of armed police officers to suppress the riot. At the same time, the police brigade of the Public Security Bureau also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. Director Wen and the inspector also personally arrived at the scene to investigate and immediately announced a temporary curfew, prohibiting vehicles and pedestrians from passing through. Wu Mingfu, Zhou Hanqing, Wu Desun, Chen Baodi, Feng Binghong, Pu Linqing, Wang Guangcai, and seven others were arrested on the spot. The remaining workers fled in all directions. The suspects were sent to the second district office for detention. Traffic was restored at about 5 p.m. The four injured workers sent by the workers were sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Headquarters Investigation: Afterwards, according to the person in charge of the Municipal Party Headquarters, the sudden refusal of the dockworkers to organize and the riot were actually instigated by someone. Therefore, the Municipal Party Headquarters advocated a thorough investigation and insisted on arresting the instigator for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Women Workers at Silk Factories in Hongkou District Suddenly Went on Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Yuncheng, Yichang, Yuanfeng, Tongwei and Other Factories Vandalized</p>
<p>▲ Workers Surrounded the Union and Made Three Demands</p>
<p>▲ Union Held an Emergency Meeting and Refused to Accept</p>
<p>More than 5,000 women workers from twelve silk factories in Hongkou District, including Xiangcheng, went on strike one after another yesterday morning, causing disturbances and vandalizing factories. The situation was serious. The Public Security Bureau temporarily imposed a strict curfew, and the government authorities immediately sent personnel to investigate. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Cause of the Strike: At about 5 a.m. yesterday morning, when the silk factories were starting work, several people resembling female workers at the gates of Xiangcheng Factory on Tiantong Road, Yichang Factory on Wuzhou Road, and others, were propagating the demand for increased wages to the female workers going to work and preventing them from entering the factories. Therefore, only seven-tenths of the female workers at Xiangcheng Factory went to work. Most of the other female workers stood outside the factory gate and watched. The factory, seeing the situation was not good, immediately released the female workers in the factory and announced a shutdown.</p>
<p>▲ Vandalism: After Xiangcheng Factory released the female workers, the entire group of female workers flocked to Yuncheng Factory, dismantled the bamboo fences of the factory, and vandalized glass windows, cooked cocoons, and other items in the workshop. They then went to Yuanfeng, Renji, Tongwei, Yujing, Yichang, and other factories and vandalized them in the same way. Other factories, upon hearing the news, closed down one after another. Therefore, after 8 a.m. yesterday morning, all the women workers from twelve silk factories in the Hongkou area joined the strike.</p>
<p>▲ Police Arrested and Suppressed: After the women workers throughout the district went on strike, more and more female workers gathered in the Tiantong Road area. Li, the director of the fifth district and third precinct of the Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, personally led inspector Ren Huaipu and a large number of police officers to the scene to suppress the riot. However, the women workers were numerous and spoke in a disorderly manner, making it impossible to disperse them for a while. After the police officers persuaded them with kind words, fortunately, no unexpected incidents occurred. At the same time, the concession authorities also sent detectives to protect Tongwei, Yujing, Yichang, and other three factories.</p>
<p>▲ Factory Losses: Afterwards, the Dagong News reporter visited Yuncheng and other silk factories and saw that the bamboo fences at the back door of Yuncheng and the cooked cocoons and other items in the workshop had been vandalized. According to the person in charge of the factory, the estimated loss was more than 2 million. The iron gates and glass windows in the workshops of Yuanfeng and Renji factories were destroyed, with losses estimated at about 1,000 taels. The short wall at the gate of Yichang Factory was also demolished, and cooked cocoons and broken glass were scattered all over the workshop, with losses estimated at about 500 taels. Tongwei and Yujing were also vandalized, but the losses were relatively light. Other factories such as Yongji, Houfu, Weiyu, and others were not affected.</p>
<p>▲ Surrounded the Union: After the strike occurred, a large number of women workers, estimated at four or five hundred, gathered at the fourth district silk industry union, surrounded the union, and demanded that the union negotiate with the capitalists to increase wages and reduce working hours. Their attitude was very strong. Police officers, upon hearing the news, went to the union to maintain order. The union directors Le Shaorong and Dong Xingen repeatedly explained and persuaded the women workers. The women workers then proposed three conditions: (1) Wages of six jiao per day, (2) restoration of the weekly fee (i.e., Shen labor), (3) working hours not to exceed eleven hours. The directors agreed to submit the conditions to an emergency meeting for discussion and then negotiate with the factory. The women workers were satisfied and withdrew from the union. However, there were still hundreds of women workers scattered in the Tiantong Road area, waiting and watching until 11:30 a.m., when they gradually dispersed.</p>
<p>▲ Union Meeting: After the women workers proposed the conditions, the union immediately convened an emergency meeting. Those present included Le Xiaorong, Dong Xingen, Gu Xiaomei, Shen Xiufeng, and more than a dozen others. The meeting was chaired by Le Xiaorong, and the following resolutions were made: (1) The workers should be persuaded to resume work first. (Resolution) (A) Persuade the workers to resume work first, (B) inform the factory to resume work as usual tomorrow, (2) How should the workers' demands for the factory to reduce working hours and restore the original wage amount be handled? (Resolution) First restore personnel and then negotiate with the capitalists, and request the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to send personnel to mediate immediately, and appoint Le Xiaorong and Dong Xingen to personally request.</p>
<p>▲ Petition to the Party and Government: After the union meeting, Le Xiaorong, Dong Xingen, and six other representatives went to Zhang Peisi, the standing committee member of the silk factory guild, and presented their demands. Zhang declined, saying that the case was of great importance. The representatives returned to the union without success. Then, Le Xiaorong and Dong Xingen, two representatives, carried a petition and appealed to the party and government organs. The original petition is recorded as follows: A petition requesting immediate mediation. It is because the factory unilaterally increased working hours for no reason, which aroused the anger of all workers. Now, they have automatically held a strike and come to the union to demand that the factory negotiate, not increase working hours, and demand increased wages and restoration of the weekly fee (Shen labor). The union has negotiated with the factory without results. We specially appoint directors Le Xiaorong and Dong Xingen to humbly request that your association (bureau) immediately send personnel to mediate, so as to avoid the expansion of the labor unrest. It is truly convenient. Respectfully presented to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>▲ Capitalists' Meeting: After the labor unrest occurred, the silk factory guild convened an emergency meeting at 4 p.m. Those present included Zhang Peisi of Xiangcheng Factory, Huang Fulin of Yichang Factory, Wei Kunjiang of Yifengren Factory, Xu Bingyuan of Yongji Factory, Xu Chunqiao of Xinglun Factory, Zhu Liansheng of Houfu Weisi Factory, Wang Zhaxuan of Tongwei Yujing Factory, and more than a dozen others. The meeting was chaired by Shen Huachen. The meeting unanimously decided to refuse to accept the conditions proposed by the women workers. If the workers can understand everything, the factory will open immediately. Otherwise, they are willing to shut down. According to Shen Huachen, the chairman of the guild, to the Dagong News reporter, this labor unrest is very unfortunate and is quite pessimistic about the future of the silk factory. Since recent years, the silk factory's foreign trade has failed, and the economic bankruptcy is well known to all sectors of society. In the current state, it is difficult to maintain if you want to add more burdens. In my opinion, this labor unrest may not be due to the automatic action of the women workers, but rather that there are villains who are inciting it. Therefore, in this labor unrest, the factory will only wait for the fair resolution of the party and government. In short, if the factory is not burdened further, it will be able to open the factory immediately. Otherwise, it will only be able to close down.</p>
<p>▲ Authorities' Investigation: After the Social Affairs Bureau received the union's petition, it immediately sent Tan Peiyan to investigate the truth. The officer immediately rushed to both the union and the guild to investigate. Because the situation has expanded, there is no appropriate solution yet. It has been decided to conduct another investigation with the Municipal Party Headquarters today in order to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Silver Dollars Being Transported</h3>
<p>Since the Northeast was forcibly occupied by Japanese invaders, the Japanese have been secretly entrusting treacherous merchants to absorb silver dollars. In November and December of last year, nearly ten million silver dollars were transported from Shanghai to Dalian, Niuzhuang, and other places, which had an immediate impact on the market. After being discovered by the authorities, the customs was ordered to prohibit it. It has been absent for several months, but recently someone has been active again. Yesterday, a certain number of Tianjin-affiliated firms in this port received twenty-four boxes of silver dollars, and another number also had eight boxes of silver dollars, totaling 160,000 yuan, and handed it over to a British merchant ship to be transported to Da Yun Yichang and Tongli to collect. The huge sum of money was initially entrusted to Litai Chang and Yitaixing Customs Brokerage to declare the transport. The two customs brokerages refused to declare the transport because it violated the patriotic movement, so it was declared and loaded by Dong Shunji, and scheduled to be transported to Dalian this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Abolish War Association Convened Yesterday to Issue Public Statement</h3>
<p>▲ Describing the Process and Encouraging Local Participation</p>
<p>▲ And Planned the Second and Third Steps</p>
<p>The General Association of the Great Alliance to Abolish Civil War held its fourth daily standing committee conversation meeting at the association at 2 p.m. yesterday. Wu Daquan, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai (representing Xu Ji), Yan Esheng, Wang Yansong, Li Kuian, Lu Zhangyuan, and others were present. Wu Daquan was publicly elected as chairman. The secretary-general first reported on the handling process and correspondence after the Lu incident occurred. After detailed discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) Reply to Mayor Shen Honglie, still adhering to his original intention, to assist the association's representative Zhang Boling in carrying out peace, (2) publish the association's public statement, describing the handling situation and encouraging local participation quickly, so as to thicken the strength and increase efficiency, (3) formulate the second and third steps, and proceed at any time depending on the opportunity. The published documents are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Shen Honglie's Telegram: To the Public Appraisal of the General Association to Abolish Civil War, Ma telegram received with respect, At this time of national crisis, it is right to unite and resist insults, The former noble association initiated the alliance to abolish civil war, benevolent words and great benefits, In line with the original intention of the martyr, Extremely deep harmony, Admiring and inexplicable, The military occurrence of Jiaodong this time, The two sides have been repeatedly telegraphed, Sincere appeal, Hope to solve the dispute by peaceful means, Chairman Han said there are no prejudices, Even Division Commander Liu also said he wants to avoid war, However, concrete measures, There is still no clue, The best is for the central government to quickly plan a proper way, Can eliminate everything, Wen Liangjun is currently confronting in Yexian, Each with considerable military strength, Laiyang Qixia, There is also preparation for war, Martyr Shen has deep shame and thinness, Nothing can help the difficult times, If you can turn evil into good, Will do its best, Although touching the top and letting go of the heels, All without reluctance, The Venerable has already telegraphed both Han and Liu, Painstaking mediation, I think you can respect the intention, Try to turn things around, The distant lotus is hanging down, The telegram is respectfully replied, I hope you will appreciate it, Shen Honglie kowtows and cultivates the seal,</p>
<p>▲ Reply to Shen Honglie's Telegram: Qingdao Mayor Shen, To the great Jian, Raising the telegram with respect, Sincere gratitude, Our association now promotes Standing Committee Member Zhang Boling, Full-power representative, Coming to Shandong on a rippling day, Personally visit the authorities, Trying to persuade and resolve, Dare to still stick to the original intention, Assist in the process, Hoping to achieve the purpose of eliminating, How can we win the expectations, General Assembly to Abolish Civil War, kowtows,</p>
<p>▲ Publish a Public Statement: When our association was preparing, the Guangqiong dispute occurred, and a representative was sent to Guangdong to explain peace. Fortunately, all parties understood. Now that our association has been formally established for less than a month, all progress is waiting to be planned. However, the storm in Jiaodong is once again tightly grasped. Most of the daily standing committee members went to Hangzhou for business, and upon hearing the news, they immediately gathered in Hangzhou to discuss measures, rushed back to Shanghai, telegraphed to stop the war, and asked Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie to mediate. On the one hand, Standing Committee Member Zhang Boling was publicly elected as the full-power representative of the association, and he went to Shandong from Tianjin on the 22nd to personally visit the authorities and explain everything. No matter what, we must find a way to resolve the situation and avoid force. Mr. Zhang has a long-standing reputation and is enthusiastic, and he will surely turn danger into safety and achieve the goal. At the same time, the second and third steps of the plan will be considered at any time depending on the situation and worked hard to proceed. The outside world places extremely high expectations on our association, and the people of our association are quick to act and are willing to do their best to fulfill their duties. However, after investigating the membership roster of our association, in Shandong Province, the members who have joined the association, in terms of organizations, only Jinan City Chamber of Commerce, Silver and Money Association, Qingdao City Chamber of Commerce Bank Association Sifang District Textile Industry Union, Wucheng Jimo Jinkou Chengyang Huailai Qihe Huangxian and other chambers of commerce, totaling twelve organizations, and in terms of individuals, only twenty-six people. That is, in Yantai, Yexian, Longkou, Laiyang, and other places where the war occurred this time, no members have joined, so contact is impossible and efficiency is slow. The strength of our association, which is used to deal with the situation, is only the unanimous effort of numerous members. Therefore, it is intended to hope that those who supervise our association will participate in our association and fight together, so as to change their attitude and position of onlookers and become directly responsible members. As for local organizations, it is especially hoped that they will actively join our association, so that when an incident occurs, the operation will be flexible, the strength will be strong, and the effect will be faster.</p>

<p>Also telegram September 18th, our three brave army detachments contacted the enemy in Shenyang South Hunhe Wave, capturing more than 20 enemies, including a captain Shitian, and obtaining 18 Type 38 rifles. On the 19th, the cavalry commander Bian Zhongming's troops of the First Military Region killed more than 10 enemies and wounded more than 10 enemies in Chaoyang.

However, the name of the appointed county magistrate needs to be resolved urgently. Moreover, most of the puppet troops hope that the national army will be dispatched to revolt. Unless there are other instructions, I hereby inform you and hope that you will inform all parties to study and recover the methods. According to Deng Tiemei, representative Wang Xiange reported that Liu Jingwen, the county magistrate of Xiuyan County, was willing to be a puppet of the Japanese invaders, harming his compatriots and intending to sell the country. The department has forced Xiuyan to be recovered immediately. Eleven Japanese officers who commanded the troops in Xiuyan were captured. Liu Jingwen escaped beforehand. Such vacant county magistrate positions should also stipulate appointment methods, and it is hoped that they will be discussed with all parties and shown quickly, so as to avoid doubts and condemnations from the authorities.

The miners in the east and west Dajing mines all fled one after another. The Japanese main street was set on fire and hundreds of homes were burned. Approximately one thousand Japanese residents were killed. The righteous army has now withdrawn from the city and is under special curfew.

<h3>Liu Zongyao Reports on the Anti-Japanese Process</h3>
<p>National News Agency said, Liu Zongyao, commander of the 4th detachment of the 26th route of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army,奉總司令張鳴五命 left the Lushan defense area in the Northeast on August 17 and went to Beiping to report to the authorities on the anti-Japanese process of the road and requested supplies of ammunition to facilitate the killing of the enemy. Mr. Liu has completed his duties in Beiping and arrived in Shanghai yesterday (23rd) with his guard company commander and entourage, staying at the Aldo Hotel. According to Mr. Liu to reporters, the road was on July 28, in the Jinzhou Yixian area, and the enemy Japanese 9th regiment engaged in several battles, and finally due to lack of ammunition, failed to wipe out the enemy, otherwise Jinzhou would have been captured by our army as soon as possible. After a short rest, Mr. Liu reported to the Volunteer Army Support Association and various groups on the anti-Japanese process of the road and requested their utmost assistance.</p>
<h3>Yang Yijie Reports on the War Situation</h3>
<p>▲ Please Provide Spiritual and Material Assistance</p>
<p>After Yang Yijie, representative of the Fourth Route Army of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, arrived in Shanghai, he went to the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association yesterday with a letter to meet with Mr. Yang Youxiang. Mr. Yang Yijie first reported on the war situation in the Northeast, stating that there was a severe lack of funds, weapons, winter clothing, and medicine, and requested assistance. He also mentioned that the army has an office in Peiping at No. 53 Jiang Yangfang Hutong, and hoped that the association would send someone to contact the office directly. Mr. Yang Youxiang promised to bring the matter up for discussion. The letter from the Fourth Route Army Headquarters is as follows:</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Ever since the invasion of the brutal Japanese, all Chinese people with blood in their veins have shared a common hatred for the enemy, vowing not to live under the same sky as the Japanese bandits. Since the September 18th Incident, we, along with our comrades, have taken it upon ourselves to resist Japan and save the country, to recover lost territory. We have been fighting bloody battles for over a year. Although we have not been able to drive the bandits out of our territory, we have at least exhausted the Japanese. All our battle achievements have a basis in fact and are well known to our compatriots in the rear. However, due to the lack of sophisticated equipment and the uncertainty of ammunition and food supplies, and the complete absence of support, we have been repeatedly gaining and losing cities, which has only emboldened the enemy. This makes us want to cry but no tears come.</p>
<p>Now, the brutal Japanese are even more reckless and have brazenly made a statement at the League of Nations, which is a preemptive scheme to openly recognize the puppet organizations they created. This is intolerable. However, empty words alone will not help, and may only invite ridicule. We and our comrades vow to shed the last drop of blood and fight the bandits to the end, preferring to be heroic ghosts who died in battle than cowardly slaves of a fallen nation. Although we want to turn the tide, we lack the strength to do so. Long-term support for our struggle depends on the generosity of our compatriots in the rear. We know that you in the association are all patriotic and enthusiastic, and that there is no shortage of righteous deeds. Therefore, we are sending this letter to ask for help, hoping to receive spiritual and material assistance to boost our morale and intimidate the enemy. The future of saving the country depends on it. We await your instructions on what to do and hope for a reply soon.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Organizations Discuss Ways to Support the Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>▲ We Cannot Bathe in the Bloody Battlefield</p>
<p>▲ We Should Do Our Best in Our Rear Positions</p>
<p>The joint office of the Hongkou District branches of the Citizens' Federation and the commercial associations of Air Liqin Road, East and West Huade Road, East and West Broadway Road, Yangshupu Road, Yinxing Road, Jiaxing Road, Hanshengli Road, Suzhou Road, Haining Road, North Xizang Road, North Jiangxi Road and other organizations believe that the recovery of the Northeast territory depends on armed resistance to the death. Moreover, the Volunteer Army has been fighting hard for a year, and military supplies and provisions must be supported by the rear in order to achieve long-term resistance. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, an emergency joint meeting was convened to discuss ways to donate money to support the Volunteer Army. Zhang Xianfang, Qiu Jialiang, Xing Guxiang, Zhou Fuzhang, Zheng Dongshan, Zhang Yumen, Zhu Zhichun, Zhu Baoluo and others attended. Qiu Jialiang chaired the meeting and Zheng Dongshan took notes. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, the discussion on ways to support the Northeast Volunteer Army resulted in the following resolutions: (1) Issue a declaration; (2) Solicit donations from shops in the Hongkou District to support the Volunteer Army as much as possible; (3) Distribute volunteer forms for reference; (4) Shops hold large sales and contribute a percentage or appropriate funds for donation; (5) Request shops to donate according to their ability; (6) Send a letter to the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association to request the establishment of donation boxes in each district for widespread fundraising; (6) Notify all shops that donations should be sent directly to the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association (donation collection points: Shanghai newspapers), which the association will not handle in order to show solemnity.</p>
<p>The declaration is as follows: Since Japan monopolized Shenyang on September 18 of last year, and dared to ignore the world and recognize its puppet organization on September 15 of this year, Japan has violated the basic principles of international law and destroyed the integrity of China's territory, usurped China's political power and administrative power, and implemented a policy of aggression. This is obvious. Our country has acceded to the covenant of the League of Nations, and the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, except for China, have mutually agreed to respect China's sovereignty and independence, as well as the integrity of its territory and administration. However, we have calmly relied on the League of Nations to administer justice for a year now. In this past year, Japan has been militaristic and exhausted its troops, using cruelty to the fullest extent. It has not only occupied the Northeast, but also disturbed Tianjin and Shanghai, killing and injuring countless Chinese people, and destroying Chinese public and private property, the extent of which is still difficult to calculate. Although the League of Nations has resolved to unconditionally withdraw Japanese troops, Japan has ignored it. The disastrous and deteriorating consequences are not limited to China, but also greatly threaten world peace. Our country does not want to abandon its policy of relying on the League of Nations, but in order to survive, we must also seek other ways. For the sake of defending the integrity of our territory, it is better to work hard to resist, which is the only way out.</p>
<p>Today, the Northeast Volunteer Army has the grand ambition of recovering lost territory and the spirit of fighting for China's survival. After years of fighting, we will see their loyal and devoted hearts, loyalty to the party and the country, which are worthy of praise. At this time of national survival, every citizen has a responsibility. Although we cannot bathe in the bloody battlefield, we should arouse our conscience and do our best in our rear positions, such as providing military supplies and other needs. Since the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association was launched, many people have donated money. The reported donations are mostly only a few yuan. These donations are truly sincere from the common people who have tightened their belts and saved money. It is commendable. Shanghai is a large and wealthy commercial port in China, a haven for wealthy merchants and tycoons. If they can save on consumption and allocate funds to support the army, the amount will be considerable. If shops and residents all donate, it can reach millions. We deeply hope that our compatriots will uphold the spirit of helping each other in the same boat, and take the risk of the sinking of China. Unite and prosper together, so that military supplies can be sufficient and military morale can be boosted, then driving out the Japanese pirates, eliminating the rebels, and recovering the three northeastern provinces can be achieved in no time. If we remain lost in delusion and the country is destroyed and our families are ruined, it will be too late to regret. The lesson of Korea is not far away. We urge our compatriots to rise up and plan for it. This is the declaration.</p>
<h3>Duan Na to Leave Shanghai for Peiping on a Scheduled Date</h3>
<p>Mr. Duan Na, advisor to Zhang Xueliang, visited Mayor Wu yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM and left after talking for about half an hour. The reporter met Duan Na at the City Hall. According to his statement, he and President Song from the Song Dynasty went to Moganshan this time, and did not visit Mr. Wang Jingwei. He used to be a newspaper reporter and would never lie to reporters. Regarding Japan's invasion and occupation of the Northeast, he deeply believes that what Mr. Lytton (wanting to place 30 million Chinese people under the control of 200,000 Japanese people is a very difficult task) said is not wrong. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Peiping on Monday (the 26th).</p>
<h3>Associations from All Circles Support Aviation Construction</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the China Aviation Construction Association has been active and effective in various tasks and has been deeply praised by all circles. Recently, in order to commemorate the national crisis, it has sent telegrams to the whole country and held aviation exhibitions and lectures, advocating the construction of aviation to relieve the national crisis. The whole country has responded and supported the association's proposals. The following have taken effect daily: (1) Tianjin Dagong Daily; (2) National Government Staff Headquarters, Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission, and Henan Provincial Government; (3) Nanhui County Government.</p>

<h3>Arguments of the Three Lawyers in the Yun Huifang Case</h3>
<p>▲ Chief Prosecutor Wang Zuzhe's Argument</p>
<p>The circumstances of the trial and verdict in the Yun Huifang case the day before yesterday were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the arguments of the defendant's lawyers Zhao Chen, Shen Junru, Li Zuyu, etc., and the argument of Chief Prosecutor Wang Zuzhe are recorded below.</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhao spoke first, stating that the police accused the defendant of three crimes, but it is valuable to consider which of these the defendant should be responsible for and which the defendant should not be responsible for. The first crime alleged by the police is obstruction of freedom under Article 318 of the Criminal Code. The police lawyer argues that the sale of Japanese goods is an individual's freedom, which is permitted under Article 37 of the Provisional Constitution. However, that article also states (the state may prohibit those that harm the public interest by law). The so-called freedom must be within the scope of the law, so Article 17 of the Provisional Constitution stipulates that it should be protected by law as long as it does not harm the public interest; otherwise, it should not be protected by law. Since the September 18th and January 28th Incidents, the patriotic movements of our compatriots have been unanimously based on the national position, but unscrupulous merchants disregard everything and sell Japanese goods. This is the so-called action that harms the public interest. The law should not only not protect it, but it actually violates the crime of foreign aggression under Article 110 of the Criminal Code. The enemy's airplanes and artillery are still intimidating us every day, and the situation in Rehe and Tianjin is critical. Although war has not actually broken out, it seems close to war. After hearing this, Judge Qian instructed the lawyer to defend within the law. Zhao then continued, stating that selling Japanese goods is actually an illegal business. The government has repeatedly issued orders for long-term resistance. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of Nationalism clearly explains the meaning of resistance in the fifth lecture, stating that there are two methods of resistance: one is active and the other is passive. Passive means non-cooperation. Therefore, the boycott movement is in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will and the government's orders. The unscrupulous merchants are undermining this movement and should be warned. They cannot be allowed to commit crimes themselves. Moreover, chambers of commerce and other organizations have long issued notices to boycott enemy goods. Even the League of Nations has provisions for economic sanctions. Without resisting first, how can we expect others to support us? Therefore, it is clear that the part of the accusation regarding obstruction of freedom is not valid.</p>
<p>The second crime is attempted murder under Article 282 of the Criminal Code. The subject of this case is actually wrong. The police believe that since the defendant committed the bombing in the French Concession, the bombing in the British Concession was also committed by the defendant. It should be known that the defendant has already confessed that the group was organized by two people. There are witnesses who have come to court to testify that the bombing of Yongchang Coal Store was not committed by Yun Huifang. How can he be held responsible for someone else's actions? The defendant's confession to the police was only a retelling of what Cai Yaozu said. This confession can only be used as a reference, and the evidence obtained through direct trial should be considered credible. Moreover, although the bombing of Yongchang injured someone, the injuries were minor. Why didn't the police prosecute him for the crime of injury, but insisted on accusing the defendant of murder? The defendant cannot be held responsible for this crime.</p>
<p>The third crime is possession of explosives under Article 200 of the Criminal Code. However, one bomb was found to belong to Cai. Although the defendant also had two bombs, they were all used up. The defendant cannot be responsible for this bomb either. In short, the first crime does not require punishment, the subject of the second crime is not the defendant, and the defendant should not be responsible for the third crime. According to the precedents of the Supreme Court over the years, the defendant is at most a continuous offender and should be acquitted according to the law. Lawyer Shen then argued that the crime of attempted murder alleged by the police is based on the defendant being a joint offender. However, according to the facts, the defendant did not conspire and the bombs did not belong to the defendant. Moreover, the defendant repeatedly confessed that he did not want to hurt anyone. Looking at the cases of the Cotton Cloth Guild and Maochang, his words are credible. When Cai threw the bomb, the defendant had not yet arrived at the scene, so he was clearly not a joint perpetrator. Therefore, the facts alleged are wrong. As for the bomb found, since it belonged to Cai, the defendant cannot be held responsible. What can be discussed is only the case of the Cotton Cloth Guild, but its purpose was to warn unscrupulous merchants. It was neither a personal infringement on an individual, nor a public infringement on an individual. It was as if it represented the public infringing on an individual. This situation is indeed special and should not be judged based on ordinary behavior. It is deeply in line with the provisions of Article 76 of the Criminal Code and should be given extra attention. Lawyer Li then argued that the obstruction of freedom is actually a continuous offense and should be acquitted. As for the attempted murder, the police also admitted that the bomb was thrown by Cai, but claimed that the defendant went with him. However, the defendant now denies it. The truth should be based on what was obtained through direct interrogation. Gu Cai had no intention of killing people, but because of the situation at the time, it was difficult to understand the things in the store, resulting in the error of injuring people. Lawyer Shen then supplemented his opinion, stating that the cause of the crime was not the defendant, but the unscrupulous merchants who sold Japanese goods. The police believe that in order to eliminate such incidents, the defendant must be severely punished. He is afraid that this will be counterproductive. The lawyers on both sides continued to debate the issue of continuous offenses for a long time before stopping.</p>
<p>Chief Prosecutor Wang Zuzhe then stood up and argued that the facts of the crime in this case are generally considered to be motivated by patriotism. However, violating the law is violating the law, and patriotic actions are patriotic actions. They cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Therefore, this case should be resolved based on the legal facts, without accommodating emotions. Looking at the three crimes alleged, in terms of obstructing freedom, the defendant has two actions, one in the French Concession and the other on Shanxi Road. Should these two actions be considered continuous and should they be considered as one crime? According to the Supreme Court's precedents, although the time and place are different, the intention is the same. It should be judged as a continuous offense according to Article 75 of the Criminal Code and should be acquitted. In terms of possession of explosives, these explosives were prepared for crimes such as obstructing freedom, so they should be punished as one crime. In terms of attempted murder, although the victim did not appear in court, the defendant cannot be accused of being present. However, according to the defendant's confession, he discussed it with Cai beforehand and went together at the time. He witnessed Cai throwing the bomb. Although he now claims in court that Cai went first and he went later, the suspicion of joint crime is difficult to deny. He should bear joint responsibility. Even if the defendant said he had no intention to kill, this is impossible to prove. However, the danger of the result of using explosives is foreseeable by everyone. Therefore, he should be punished under Article 294 of the Criminal Code and the term of imprisonment should be appropriately reduced according to Articles 30 and 77 of the same law.</p>
<p>Judge Qian then based his decision on Article 294 of the crime of injury and reduced the sentence by two-fifths within the applicable term of imprisonment and sentenced him to three months of imprisonment. Yun was released on bail by his original guarantor. It is still unknown whether he will appeal.</p>
<h3>Wusong Yinxing Town Intercepts Two Kidnappers</h3>
<p>▲ Four Bandits Suddenly Arrived at the Home of Xu Zhongtang</p>
<p>▲ Opened Fire Twice as a Warning, Robbing and Kidnapping First</p>
<p>▲ Police Arrived and Rescued the Hostage on the Spot</p>
<p>A major robbery and kidnapping case occurred yesterday at the home of Xu Zhongtang, a villager in Nanshao Lane, Yinxing Town, 7th District, Wusong Public Security Bureau. After the police received the news, they intercepted the hostage and captured two kidnappers. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Robbery at Xu Zhongtang's House: Xu Zhongtang, a 65-year-old villager in Nanshao Lane, three miles south of Yinxing, has two sons. The eldest son, Lansheng, is 17 years old, and the youngest son, Quansheng, is 5 years old. He has some farmland. Recently, 9 mu of his farmland was taken for use in the central urban area, and he received 200 yuan per mu for the land price, which aroused the coveting of bandits. Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, a car suddenly arrived with four bandits who spoke with a local accent. They held two pistols and arrived at the entrance of Xu's house, firing two shots as a warning first. They then rushed into the inner room and robbed 104 yuan in cash. Just as they were about to leave, they were still not satisfied. They happened to see Xu's eldest son, Lansheng, at the entrance,</p>
<p>So They Kidnapped Lansheng: When they were putting him in the car, the bandits only cared about the hostage. Xu Zhongtang took the opportunity to escape and rushed to the police station to report. Patrol Officer Tian Liang of the police station immediately led the police officers to the scene. They saw a car with the hostage still being watched by the bandits, sitting in the car. Patrol Officer Tian and others went forward to surround and arrest them. The bandits fled in different directions, and the police were able to</p>
<p>Rescue the Hostage on the Spot: When the police rescued the hostage, the car took the opportunity to drive away. At that time, the local defense team also came to help surround and capture the bandits. Patrol Officer Tian and others also tracked down the bandits. They found the four bandits eating at the home of kidnapper Ge Yousheng at No. 4 Xitangjia Bridge, 5th District, 5th Precinct. When they saw the police, they scattered and fled. Patrol Officer Tian and others went forward and</p>
<p>Arrested Kidnapper Lu Jiangsheng: One of them. A pistol was found on Lu's body. Unexpectedly, when the other three bandits escaped, they encountered Defense Platoon Leader Zhu Wenxiang and others who had arrived. Platoon Leader Zhu captured kidnapper Zhang Maofu. The other two bandits had already escaped. Patrol Officer Tian and others went to the home of the escaped kidnapper Shen Xinglin at No. 5 Zhoujiawan. Because Shen was not there, they arrested his wife, Shen Chen. A bullet casing was also found at Xu Zhongtang's house. The bandits Lu Jiangsheng and Zhang Maofu,</p>
<p>The Bandit Woman Shen Chen, etc.: And the bullet casing were all sent to the 1st Precinct of the 7th District of Wusong. After personally interrogating them, Director Yang learned that the bandits claimed that Lu Jiangsheng lived in Lujiagang, was 28 years old, and was invited by Ge Yousheng and Shen Xinglin to help them borrow money. The pistol was his. Zhang Maofu claimed that he lived in Zhangjiazha, 5th Precinct, 5th District, was 36 years old, and the rest of his statement was the same as Lu's. Shen Chen claimed that her husband invited Zhang Maofu and others to Xu Zhongtang's house to borrow money and did not rob them. Director Yang said that the hostage was rescued on the spot, and the evidence was conclusive. How could they be allowed to quibble? Moreover, it was found that Zhang and Lu were</p>
<p>Well-Known Local Thugs: Their usual behavior was terrible. Now that they have been arrested, they still dare not tell the truth. This is contempt for the law. If they are not severely punished according to the law, it will not be enough to warn the bandits. In addition to ordering the police to strictly pursue the escaped bandits, he also prepared a document to send the arrested bandits Lu Jiangsheng, Zhang Maofu, and Shen Chen to the Public Security Bureau for punishment according to the law. It is said that Xu Zhongtang's youngest son, Quansheng, was kidnapped by these bandits in August of last year. After asking someone to contact the bandits, he was redeemed. This is the second time that his eldest son has been kidnapped.</p>
<h3>Niece Falsely Accuses Uncle of Kidnapping</h3>
<p>▲ Holding a Grudge for Not Getting Money</p>
<p>▲ Many Receipts in the Handbag</p>
<p>At 10:00 PM the night before last, a woman dressed in a cheongsam and leather shoes, resembling a female student, accompanied by a man named Hu Yiping, went to the Third District of the Pudong Public Security Bureau to report that her husband, Xu Baolin, had been kidnapped by bandits and was being held in a house at No. 348 Yangjiazhai, demanding a large ransom, and requesting rescue. Director Zhang, believing that the case was of great importance, immediately ordered a patrol officer to lead the police to search the address. Unexpectedly, when they entered the house, the person whom Ms. Zhang pointed out as the kidnapper was not surprised or fled. Xu Baolin himself was also sitting in the house. The police took the man and Xu to the district, where Director Zhang immediately conducted a preliminary interrogation. Xu Zhang, 26 years old, from Zhejiang, residing at No. 24 Beller Road in the French Concession, stated that the defendant kidnapped her husband a few days ago and demanded a ransom, etc. Hu Yiping, 26 years old, from Anhui, stated that he saw her crying at the Nanjing Road Pier today. When he asked her why, she said that her husband had been kidnapped by bandits in Pudong and there was no way to rescue him. He felt sorry for her, so he asked the police for assistance. The police said that the matter was in the Chinese area and had nothing to do with them, so he accompanied her to the district. He did not know anything else.</p>
<p>The defendant, Tong Baorong, 44 years old, from Zhejiang, residing at No. 348 Yangjiazhai, stated that the plaintiff's accusation was completely false. He is the plaintiff's uncle. The plaintiff's son was sick and died a few days ago. Xu Baolin brought the dead child to his house. He had no choice but to take out three yuan to buy a small coffin to collect and bury the body. Because she had no money, she kept asking him for money. Because she did not get it, she held a grudge and falsely accused him of being a bandit. She also has an older brother named Zhang Zihua who runs the Baoshuntang Pharmacy at No. 108 Yangjiadu, etc.</p>
<p>The witness, Zhang Zufang, also reported that the plaintiff and defendant were uncle and niece. Director Zhang was greatly surprised by the confession. He immediately ordered Zhang Zihua to be summoned to the case. Zhang stated that the plaintiff and he were half-siblings. Their father passed away in 1926. The following year, his younger sister was introduced by a friend and married Wang Gongxia. Wang worked at the Capital Garrison Headquarters, and she went to Beijing with Wang. In 1928, she filed a complaint with the Nanjing Women's Association, accusing her husband of abuse and requesting relief. After mediation, they reconciled. Not long after, Wang went to Qingdao with Wu Siyu. She changed her mind and filed for divorce from Wang in the Suzhou court. At that time, she was having an affair with Xu Baolin, so she moved to Shanghai. Now, because her child had died, she wanted to move into his house. The neighbors advised her not to listen. After mediation by the neighbors, she was given some silver dollars to settle the matter. Unexpectedly, she fabricated the accusation that her uncle was a bandit, suspecting that she was mentally ill, etc.</p>
<p>Xu Baolin confessed that he had been having an affair with Zhang for many days and was not a legally married couple. Director Zhang, after hearing the confessions, realized that the case was clear. However, it was necessary to investigate why Ms. Zhang had used the trick of falsely reporting a kidnapping. He checked the handbag she was carrying and found many receipts. The content was roughly: After I met you, I have always loved you. We will grow old together. If I abandon you halfway, I will give you alimony, etc. There were also seven or eight notes saying, Please pay the bearer ○○ yuan in cash (one for 50 million, one for 100 million, and four or five for smaller amounts). Director Zhang asked Ms. Zhang about these receipts. She claimed that they were written by several of her former lovers. Director Zhang said that there were too many such slippery notes, indicating that she had been fooled by others several times. However, judging from her tone and demeanor, she did not seem to be mentally ill. Therefore, the case was very bizarre, but accusing her uncle of being a kidnapper without cause constituted the crime of false accusation. He ordered the witnesses in the case to be sent to the local court for questioning in the afternoon yesterday.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Discovers Counterfeit Certificates of Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>▲Letter to the Cotton Weaving Trade Association for Investigation</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently discovered that Guangxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory had privately manufactured the Chamber's certificate of domestic goods. A letter was sent to the Silk and Cotton Weaving Trade Association, asking for details of the certificate's origin for further investigation. The original letter stated: Respectfully, This Chamber has recently discovered a copy of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's certificate of domestic goods produced by Guangxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory. Upon checking the certificate stub of this Chamber, the factory has never issued a certificate from this Chamber. Based on the circumstances, it should be privately manufactured. Your association is requested to send personnel to inquire about the origin of the certificate in detail for further investigation. If the factory intends to deceive, this Chamber will send a circular to various places to detain the factory's products as a warning to those who intend to deceive. Furthermore, it is necessary to prevent similar incidents in other dyeing and weaving factories. Therefore, a separate list of the number of dyeing and weaving factory certificates already issued by this Chamber is attached for your association to check each factory to distinguish between truth and falsehood. This is of utmost importance. Sincerely, Shanghai Silk and Cotton Weaving Trade Association.</p>
<h3>Labor Strike at Xiangsheng Iron Factory - Hefeng Went on Strike Yesterday in Support</h3>
<p>▲The Dispute is Intensifying</p>
<p>▲The Labor Side's Attitude is Firm</p>
<p>Dagongshe reports that a major labor dispute occurred at the Xiangsheng Iron Factory due to the dismissal of workers. After three mediation attempts by party and government agencies, no agreement has been reached. The foreign manager of Xiangsheng insists on dismissing 106 workers before allowing the factory to reopen. After many days of stalemate, there is no solution, and the labor unrest is escalating. Workers at the Yangjingdong Hefeng Weaving Factory went on strike yesterday morning to support the reinstatement of the Xiangsheng workers and to prompt the capitalists to realize the situation. In addition to organizing a picket line to maintain order, the workers of both factories are extremely firm in their attitude and have resolved not to resume work until the capitalists agree to cancel the harsh conditions and not dismiss a single person. After the factory strike, the union has sent Director Zhang Linhua to report to the party and government agencies, requesting mediation. According to the labor side, if external forces intrude to disrupt the labor movement, they will seek a united response.</p>
<h3>Postal Employees Will Have Delayed Promotions</h3>
<p>▲The Union Issued a Warning Yesterday</p>
<p>According to a conversation with a committee member of the Postal Workers' Union, it was recently heard that a specialist member of the Postal Economic System Research Committee has suggested to the Directorate General of Posts to postpone the promotion schedule of employees in order to break the current difficult situation of the postal economy. The Directorate General of Posts also has plans to implement this. This move has caused considerable dissatisfaction among employees, because the current postal economic difficulties were caused by the separation of the Savings and Remittance Bureau. If the Savings and Remittance Bureau is not thoroughly recovered and this attempt to address the symptoms rather than the root cause is pursued, it will be difficult to break the current postal economic difficulties. A letter has been sent to warn them to abandon this plan to avoid public anger.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau Emphasizes Fisheries Protection</h3>

<h3>Water Was Cut Off at Mingyuanfang Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲There Is Also a Dispute at Fen'anfang</p>
<p>Guowenshe reports that the water company wants to force the installation of water meters, and citizens have been protesting in recent days. However, the company has successively cut off the water supply. Yesterday, the water supply was suddenly cut off at Mingyuanfang, Huade Road, causing panic among all the tenants in the neighborhood. In addition to severe negotiations with the company, members were specially dispatched to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Taxpaying Chinese Association, and other groups to appeal for relief. At the same time, the branch company also plans to cut off the water supply to Fen'anfang on East and West Huade Roads. The correspondence is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Letter from the Taxpaying Chinese Association to the Shanghai Settlement Taxpaying Chinese Association: Respectfully, according to a letter from the mutual aid association of residents of Mingyuanfang, Huade Road in the settlement, a letter was recently received from the British-owned water company stating that the owner did not pay the water bill and decided to cut off the supply, and at 10:45 a.m. today, when the residents were preparing meals, the water gate was closed and the water supply was stopped. Water is one of the essential elements of life, and once it is cut off, the business lives of taxpayers in 184 buildings will suffer losses. For this reason, the members of our association, Zhou Yuantian and Zhang Shengyou, were dispatched to meet with your association to request assistance and to seek an interview. Immediately send a letter to the Municipal Council and immediately order the fire brigade to first open the public taps along the road for temporary relief to alleviate the immediate crisis. Notify the water company to open the water supply as soon as possible and handle it in accordance with the law. The association believes that such a situation can easily lead to serious consequences, and the Council is requested to quickly order the water company to open the water source and handle it in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>▲Fen'an Company Letter to the Officer of the British-Owned Shanghai Water Company: Regarding the letter sent on the 12th of this month regarding the water bill for Fen'anfang, Dongxi Huade Road, we have not received a reply regarding the reason for the exemption from rent and water bill based on the Municipal Council General Donation as the standard. Up to Friday of this week, our company sent personnel to your company to inquire about the above matters and explained the reasons. However, your staff insisted that the landlord was afraid of the tenants and waived the rent. Does this mean that the Municipal Council is also afraid of the tenants and exempts the municipal general donation for two months? It is necessary to cut off the water supply to blackmail the lives. The tenants are the ones who use the water, and the water bill should be collected directly from them by your company. There is no relationship with the landlord, and the payment of water bills by successive agents is an obligation, not a right. Our company has not received rent for February and March, but it is unreasonable to compensate your company for the water bill. Chinese and foreigners have the same feelings, and there is no such evil precedent in the world. Power is temporary, but reason is permanent. Please think twice. Please reply as soon as possible. If your company insists on using intimidation and oppression, then water is a necessity for life. For the sake of humanitarianism and caring for the lives of tenants, our company will store money and wait while protesting, and only pay the water bill first. Special letter.</p>
<p>▲Water Company Reply: Respectfully replying to your letter of the 16th of this month regarding the houses in Fen'anfang, Dongxi Huade Road, our company should still collect the water fee for the water supplied when the houses are still occupied. Your office must know this. If the tenant's rent has been resolved and rent is waived, or the Public Settlement Municipal Council temporarily waives the municipal donation, your office has no reason to request a uniform exemption from the water bill for two months. Furthermore, this matter has been investigated clearly by our company in March. The water bill calculated for the property is only calculated according to the number of occupied houses at that time. Based on this, it can be seen that our company has been extremely lenient. The payment deadline for the amount due by your office, which was explained to your representative the day before yesterday, will expire tomorrow. I am writing this letter specifically to remind you of this. If your office does not settle it, the supply will be stopped at that time. Special letter. To Fenxing Real Estate Company, British-Owned Shanghai Water Company, agent secretary, Luo Keqi.</p>
<h3>Muslims Held a General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Discussing How to Deal with Insulting Words in Nanhua</p>
<p>Local Muslims held a general meeting at the Nanshi Qingzhen North Temple at 5 p.m. yesterday. Mingshi Ha Shaofu was elected as the temporary chairman. First, Wang Yijun reported the discovery of insulting words (Why Don't Muslims Eat Pork?) in the 14th issue of the first volume of Nanhua Literary and Artistic Bimonthly and proposed methods of handling it. Next, Ma Tianying spoke, saying that the relationship between Muslims and Han Chinese in our country has been harmonious for a long time, and since the republic, the cooperation has been even closer. Moreover, there are 50 million Muslims in our country, and most of them are Han Chinese who believe in Islam. They are not uncivilized people. However, Shanghai, which claims to be the center of culture, has such extremely insulting words. There are many people in our religion who understand justice deeply. Even if they can temporarily suppress and wait for a legal solution, the company is willing to take the risk during this period of national crisis and wants to provoke the aversion between ethnic groups in the country. If it causes a civil war, the cause of the trouble starts with them. Although it is not appropriate to say that it is a crime of endangering the Republic of China, as evidenced by the fact that the British government in 1857 mistakenly added lard to the oil for wiping the guns of Indian soldiers, which caused a mutiny and a tragic bloodbath, because there are many Muslims in India who thought it was intended to insult them. From this example, it can be seen. After finishing his speech, Ha Decheng Ahun spoke, adding to the handling methods proposed by Wang Yijun: (1) The company should formally apologize to Muslims in the journal; (2) The Muslim General Assembly should write an article and order the company to publish it; (3) Ensure that there will be no more such defamatory words in the future; (4) The current issue of the journal should be burned publicly. The above methods were discussed and unanimously approved by the entire meeting. Then, the Muslim Association sent Ha Shaofu, Fu Jingzhi, and Wang Yisan to negotiate with the journal. It is heard that all four items have been fully accepted by the journal and will be published in the 15th issue.</p>
<h3>Younger Sister Sues Her Brother to Award Her a Portion of the Inheritance</h3>
<p>Wu Miaofu, the head of Chedaigjiao, Shanghai West, had five children during his lifetime. His estate was quite large. His son, Changsheng, was married, and his three daughters were married. However, his third daughter, Mituo, had not yet been married. After Miaofu's death, Changsheng inherited his father's legacy and frequently abused his younger sister. On New Year's Eve of the sixteenth year, he even drove Mituo away, causing her to work as a worker for many years to make a living. She repeatedly asked Changsheng to award her a portion of the inheritance, but Changsheng stubbornly refused. Mituo then hired lawyers Feng Xizui and Wu Zhengjiao to ask the First Special District Court to order Changsheng to award her a portion of the inheritance to support her life. Yesterday, Judge Yang Peng came to the Civil Court No. 10 for questioning. Mituo, dressed in rags and tears, accompanied lawyers Feng and Wu, as well as the defendant and the lawyers Zhang Zhengxue and Fang Jiahe hired by the defendant, all arrived at the court one after another. First, the plaintiff and defendant stated the facts, and then Judge Yang told Changsheng that no matter what the law is, the law is based on human feelings. The living conditions of you and your sister are very different today. If your sister is forced by hunger and cold and dies of starvation, how can a brother bear it? It is hoped that the lawyers on both sides will persuade the two parties to make every effort to reconcile in order to maintain friendship. Then, he adjourned the hearing to a later date and left.</p>
<h3>Zhang Aweng, Impoverished and Ill, Cuts Off His Throat</h3>
<p>▲Serious Injury and Life-Threatening</p>
<p>Zhang Aweng from Wuxi, 41 years old, lived at No. 30 Wenxingfang, Baikaier Road, Hongkou. He used to work at the Shenxin Yarn Factory. His wife, Shen, is 39 years old. Recently, Zhang has been ill for two months, and life has been difficult and economically distressed. After thinking about it over and over again, he wondered how to make a living. At about 8 p.m. last night, he suddenly had the thought of ending his life, so he grabbed a vegetable knife and cut off his throat, and his breath was dying. Later, his family sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment by car. It is said that Zhang's injuries are serious and may be life-threatening.</p>
<h3>A Truck Killed a Woman While Transporting Goods</h3>
<p>Jin Zhao, a vegetable seller, went to the South Shanghai vegetable market yesterday morning to sell vegetables. Unexpectedly, a truck driven by Peng Fentai came and accidentally hit the woman, injuring her vital organs. The police officer on duty took Peng into custody at the Second District Police Station and sent the woman to Shanghai Hospital, but she died before she could be treated. Peng was sent to the local court for interrogation, and the head of the local neighborhood was ordered to report the autopsy to the local court.</p>

<p>The Miraculous Effect of Yanling's Plaster</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Zijia recently suffered from rheumatism. After drinking alcohol, blisters would appear on his palms, which, although not harmful to his health, caused unbearable itching and inconvenience. A friend repeatedly gave Mr. Qiu, who works at Yiji Hang, a good domestic medicine called Yanling's Plaster for trial use. The effect was surprisingly miraculous, and he was cured with just one box. Mr. Qiu praised it greatly. Dr. Wang Zhenchuan of the Red Cross also praised it as a truly effective domestic medicine for rheumatism, capable of defeating imported products. It is said that each box is sold for only twenty cents in small coins, and it is mainly used to treat water sores, festering feet, infantile eczema, and all kinds of skin diseases. The Social Daily Newspaper provides coupon giveaways. Samples will be sent upon request.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor: According to our client, the Zhongfa Real Estate Trust Company, we have read a news item in your newspaper's local news section titled "Tenants of Laotianyu Alley Oppose Demolition and File Lawsuit," which is inconsistent with the facts. The demolition and construction of houses in Laotianyu Alley has been repeatedly notified to all tenants, and they have been asked to move out. The tenants have repeatedly requested extensions, and the deadline has long passed. Most of the tenants have already moved out, and only a small number of tenants remain, occupying the premises and refusing to move, which inevitably hinders the progress of our company's work. Our company has not received small rents of 500 yuan or 300 yuan from the tenants, nor has it stated that the leases can be extended for more than five years. If the tenants privately transfer the houses among themselves and there are transfer fees, it has nothing to do with our company. We should not use sensational language to harm our company's reputation. We are deeply concerned that false rumors will easily lead to misunderstandings. We have entrusted you to write a letter of correction. We hope you will investigate and promptly publish a correction in the letter column. Sincerely, Lawyer Xu Yannian, September 23rd.</p>

<h3>Random Quotes from 93-Year-Old Ma Xiangbo About the World Fifty or Sixty Years Ago</h3>
<p>Dr. Ling, on behalf of the Shen Bao newspaper, invited Elder Xiang to write a commemorative essay describing the academic atmosphere of the world over the past sixty years. After some discussion, I first searched for historical materials in the Xuhui Library and compiled a table of major events. After Elder Xiang read it, we had a brief chat.</p>
<p>In 1881 (the seventh year of the Guangxu Emperor), Elder Xiang recounted his interactions with Takezoe Shin'ichiro in Korea. That year, Korea was in turmoil, and China sent troops for more than a year, which brought a year of peace before the chaos resumed. Elder Xiang then went to the United States and recounted an event:</p>
<p>During the Guangxu eleventh year, the state of Philadelphia held a centennial celebration in memory of Washington. There were cadet corps, cavalry, etc., with the officers all being cadets. At that time, the French envoy to the United States, Gu, said to the elder: (Who dares to compete with this country!) (Quoting from the "Mirror to Reflect the People's Hearts"). Later, he traveled to England and visited famous universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. Elder Xiang said that many of the seats of famous people who had studied at these schools were still preserved as historical sites. He then went to Paris, where European universities still valued classical literature, with Latin and Greek being compulsory subjects.</p>
<p>He also recounted a historical event: When Italy was first unified, it seized the territory of the Roman Pope. When the army surrounded the city, the Pope, with benevolence in mind, ordered the volunteers from all directions who had come to defend the holy city not to fight. One volunteer, seeing through the world, entered a monastery and traveled across the ocean to China to preach. Elder Xiang even met him personally! This problem was only recently resolved. Italy still regards Catholicism as the state religion, which shows that governing with virtue is better than governing with force!</p>
<p>Speaking of Japan, Yang Shoujing took advantage of their disregard for Chinese studies to acquire a large number of ancient books and bring them back. However, although they disregarded Chinese studies, they still respected Chinese people. The world is very different now, and there is a sense of the vicissitudes of life in his words!</p>
<p>Guangzhou Miscellany</p>
<p>A Yan</p>
<p>|General Observations|</p>
<p>In the restaurants and teahouses of Guangzhou, the faces of the waiters are always expressionless. They do not call you "sir" or greet you warmly. Regardless of the status of the customers, they treat everyone the same. On the surface, they seem very indifferent, but they are very responsible in their duties.</p>
<p>Education is particularly developed. Ordinary families give their children a considerable education, so illiteracy is gradually decreasing. Almost all the people thronging the streets every morning, evening, and noon are male and female students. The female students wear white tops and black skirts, and the skirts are so high that almost their buttocks can be seen.</p>
<p>Women mostly mature early. At the age of thirteen or fourteen, their breasts are already high, so some people say that many girls over sixteen are not virgins. Their way of looking at men is somewhat different from Shanghai women. Shanghai women only look at you when you are not looking at them. When they meet a man they like, they often stare to their heart's content, making it impossible for the other person to cope.</p>
<p>The honesty of the rickshaw pullers is beyond our expectations. Bargaining will not exceed ten cents. They do not ask you to add money after reaching your destination. Even if you give them a coin to find change, they calculate according to the market price and never deduct one or two cents from you. This is enough to show the general nature of the staunch Cantonese people.</p>
<p>The concession in Guangzhou, Shamian, is separated from Guangzhou by only one river, but because the construction of Guangzhou city is very good, few citizens go to the concession. I personally did not go to the concession once during the half year I was there.</p>

<p>I recently accepted my friend Jiang Hongjiao's invitation to visit the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory. I was warmly received by Cai Shengbai and Gao Shiheng, the factory's general managers, who explained everything to me. I visited everything from the weaving factory to the printing and finishing factories. More than a thousand male and female workers were diligently working in an orderly manner, which is attributed to the application of scientific management methods. The printed crepe de chine and georgette produced are extremely soft and beautiful, surpassing imported products. However, the production process is very arduous. In the past, when people enjoyed a meal, they thought of the hard work of the farmers and sighed that every grain was hard-earned. Now, seeing the women weaving brocade on the loom, their ten fingers moving incessantly, I also sigh that every thread is hard-earned. I send a message to those who wear silk and satin: Remember this! Remember this!</p>
<p>Small is the Way to Go</p>
<p>Feng</p>
<p>|The Smaller the Better|</p>
<p>Nowadays, everything is about "small." Whenever a word is preceded by the adjective "small," the thing represented by that word becomes very popular. Here are a few examples.</p>
<p>The synonym for wife is "laopo." Adding the word "small" before "laopo" makes the wife more loved by her husband than without the word "small." The synonym for residence is "gongguan." Adding the word "small" before "gongguan" makes the residence more luxurious than a large "gongguan." "Xiansheng" is a synonym for prostitute. Adding the word "small" before "xiansheng" makes her even more marketable. A fair face is already pleasing. Adding the word "small" before "fair face" makes her even more lovable. Cigarettes used to be popular in large sizes, but now they have been scaled down, and small cigarettes are very popular. Mooncakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival used to be made as large as possible, but now they are made as small as possible and called "small mooncakes." The Austin car was originally very famous, but now fashionable people prefer to ride in a "Pei Pei" (i.e., "small") Austin. Even adding the word "small" to the synonym for vagrant, "dou luan," or to "bie san" seems to make them more popular than those without the "small" prefix. People get bored reading newspapers, so many "small" newspapers have sprung up to meet the demand.</p>
<p>Indeed, to be in the limelight these days, you need the word "small." You complain that society loves "small" in everything. Even in terms of countries, "small" ones benefit. Our eastern neighbor is shorter than us in terms of people, and smaller than us in terms of land, but this great country of ours is not as much in the limelight as our eastern neighbor. I wonder if shrinking the territory will also bring some of the benefits of the "small" prefix?</p>
<p>Lead Coins</p>
<p>Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>|A Kind of Social Pathology|</p>
<p>Perhaps the current society is a two-faced society of truth and falsehood! The already chaotic Chinese currency system, with its banknotes, silver dollars, large coins, small coins, etc., has now seen the emergence of lead coins. It is said that some unscrupulous people are casting silver coins with lead and passing them off as genuine, harming society.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, almost everyone has come into contact with these lead coins and suffered from their toxicity. However, lead coins are still being produced in increasing numbers and circulating freely. I have not heard of any measures taken by the authorities to crack down on them.</p>
<p>I once saw a rickshaw puller holding a lead coin, looking mournful. He said that he had run for many miles, and this strange coin was his reward. I think the tragedy caused by lead coins is not limited to the above-mentioned case.</p>
<p>A friend told me that he never has lead coins left in his purse because if he gets a lead coin that is rejected, he always spends it the second or third time. But I am not like that. If I unfortunately get a lead coin, I put it under house arrest. So I have accumulated quite a few of these coins.</p>
<p>It is said that some exchange shops specialize in buying these counterfeit coins at low prices and exchanging them for genuine coins to other people. These shop owners have obviously not thought about the crimes caused by using counterfeit coins. Otherwise, are they really heartless?</p>
<p>When receiving coins, people have to repeatedly check them. The person giving the coin is afraid of giving a lead coin, and the person receiving the coin is afraid of getting a lead coin. This is enough to reduce people's trust, let alone doing this on purpose to harm society!</p>
<p>I think this matter, though small, should also attract the attention of the financial authorities.</p>
<p>Shuobu Rotary Club</p>
<p>Silver Thread (23)</p>
<p>Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>(12)</p>
<p>Zhu Qilan wanted to give a speech herself, but since no one invited her, she went to her father and asked him to think of a way. Zhu Bofang was very willing for his daughter to be in the limelight in public, but since Director Yuan had already given a speech, the only thing left was to hold the unveiling ceremony. Moreover, it was getting late, the sky was gradually darkening, and they still had to take photos. It was impossible for anyone else to give a speech, so he just feigned asking: "Is there anyone else who wants to speak? Or is there any female guest who wants to speak?"</p>
<p>Zhu Qilan swallowed, cleared her throat, and was about to stand in the center of the stage to represent the female guests to give a speech when the county magistrate suddenly said, "It's getting late. Let's hold the unveiling ceremony, Mr. Zhu! Please tell the musicians to play!" Zhu Qilan, blushing, had to step back, hating the county magistrate very much, but there was nothing she could do.</p>
<p>The monument was built of Jinshan stone and was more than two zhang (about 20 feet) high. It was a simple triangular prism with a pagoda-like shape. The four large golden characters on the monument were "Zhi Zhen An Ning" (Stabilize the Town and Pacify the People), and a few lines of smaller characters read: "Yuan Tuantuan Kai, defended this land and resisted the enemy for a month, his hard work was meritorious, the residents of this town are grateful, and erected this monument to commemorate him forever. Municipal Committee Member Zhu Bofang, et al."</p>
<p>The base of the monument was filled with flowers and surrounded by the Party and National Flag, which was tied with two red ribbons. By simply pulling the slipknot of the long ribbon from afar, the flag could be detached and lowered.</p>
<p>The military music had already started. Zhu Qilan, full of spirit, held a large bouquet of flowers in her hand, first walked to the front of the stage and stood still, her face full of smiles. She pulled the ribbon, and the Party and National Flag slowly descended. There was a burst of applause from the stage and below. Who knew that the flag only fell halfway, as if it was caught on something.</p>
<p>The ribbon was broken, and the bouquet of flowers also fell to the ground. Zhu Qilan's face was flushed red. "Who did this?" The county magistrate was a little angry, and Zhu Bofang's face turned as white as paper. But Director Yuan looked at it and laughed because of it.</p>
<p>"Get a ladder and go up and take it down." Director Yuan said calmly.</p>
<p>The military band was out of luck and had to keep playing, blowing for more than ten minutes.</p>
<p>"The location of this monument is really not good. It is built against a large screen wall, and it is not surrounded by open space. And the screen wall is pitifully short, making it very difficult to match. If the two flags are removed, the form of the monument will be even more unsightly." The chief of the Public Security Bureau thought to himself, and thus noticed the screen wall.</p>
<p>"Hey! There's probably a ladder leaning against the back of the screen wall, isn't there? Isn't the top of a ladder showing on the screen wall?" the chief of the Public Security Bureau shouted.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Zhu Bofang, in order to redeem himself, personally went down the stage, ran to the back of the screen wall, carried the ladder out, leaned it against the screen wall, and personally climbed up to take down the flag. Who knew that there was a person squatting on the pagoda-shaped eaves of the monument.</p>
<p>"Ah! ... Ah! ... Yuan the Madman..." The scene was suddenly in chaos.</p>

<p>Gold Bullion Market Entering a Better Phase</p>
<p>People's Expectations are Rising... Rebound of 9.4 Taels</p>
<p>▲ Central Bank's Cash Absorption is Aggressive</p>

Due to various optimistic reasons, although the silver market rose, forward contracts moved in the opposite direction, falling instead.

The market is expected to contract further, and the internal situation is improving. It is also heard that the Central Bank is absorbing physical gold, which is being handled by Dadecheng. Therefore, the buying sentiment on the surface is very strong, and prices have risen sharply by five taels. The situation is unusually aggressive, and the market finally retreated slightly, trading between 726 taels.

The British, Indian, and German currencies remained unchanged. At 3:00 PM, the exchange rate suddenly decreased by half a grade, with the British gold decreasing by 125 and the US dollar decreasing by 25.

As a result, the British gold decreased by 25 and the US dollar decreased by 4375 compared to the previous evening. The gold market rebounded, rising to 727 to 728 taels.

<p>Silver Demand is Still Weak and Foreign Exchange Transactions Will be Smooth</p>
<p>According to the financial market atmosphere, this time of year in the past was the peak season, and the use of silver dollars should have been smooth. However, this year, due to various factors, the import of goods into this port has been greatly reduced, and the demand for silver dollars is needless to say. The good period has been missed. The reluctance of silver and money businesses to provide loans as much as possible is also a major cause of market stagnation. As far as yesterday's situation is concerned, the use of silver is unlikely to be obvious, but the prospects for foreign exchange will gradually have the opportunity to be smooth.</p>

Guangdong small foreign coins opened slightly higher in the morning by 2 hao and a half, at 5 cents 8 minutes 6 li 7 hao and a half. The noon market suddenly improved by 1 li 2 hao and a half, to 5 cents 8 minutes 8 li. Transactions were 140,000 horns in the morning market and 90,000 horns in the noon market.

The forward market was also lighter than the previous day. The market sentiment of buyers and sellers was quite idle. The total turnover in the morning and afternoon was 2,385,000 yuan. The bond market environment was as dull as before, and the sentiment was very cold. New transactions in the market were very rare, and only scattered inflows and outflows and swap transactions were the majority. As a result, the trend was sluggish, and there were only one or two jiao fluctuations in the front and back markets. Observing the trend of the bond market, it is temporarily difficult to expect development, or it will become more calm.</p>

<h3>The Truth Behind the Tragic Death of Driver Jiang Haitao of the Special Court</h3>
<p>▲ Another Driver Dismissed by the Court</p>
<p>▲ Suspected that Jiang Provoked Resentment</p>
<p>▲ Paid 200 Yuan to Hire a Murderer</p>
<p>▲ Trial Concluded Yesterday, Debate Ended</p>
<p>Jiang Haitao, who worked as a driver in the First Special District Court and resided at No. 130 Shanjia Garden, Guling Road, left home at 8:30 a.m. on the 15th of this month to go to work at the court. However, after walking only a few steps, Zhang Zimei from Tongzhou suddenly followed behind him and made suspicious movements. Jiang noticed this and ran forward. Zhang pursued relentlessly. Jiang tripped and fell. Zhang caught up, pulled out a sharp bayonet, and stabbed Jiang seven times, causing critical injuries. Blood gushed out, and Jiang collapsed to the ground, dying shortly after. Seeing his goal achieved, Zhang turned and fled. Pedestrian Dai Shengrong and watchman No. 277 happened to witness the incident and helped to apprehend Zhang. A knife sheath was found near him, but the murder weapon was discarded halfway by Zhang and recovered by someone, who handed it to the police. The knife was stained with blood. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Zhu Mengwei and Western Detective Pei Naiduo arrived and took Zhang and the knife to the Xinzha Police Station. The deceased's body was taken to the morgue for examination. After confirming the body, the widow, Jiang Zhu, was instructed to arrange for the coffin and burial. The arrest and investigation of the murderer have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zimei was escorted by the police station to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, rose to present the case, stating that Zhang was being prosecuted under Article 284, Section 1 of the Criminal Law for premeditated murder. The case occurred at 8:30 a.m. on the 15th of this month. Witness Dai Shengrong was walking on Guling Road when he suddenly heard the sound of two people chasing each other behind him. Soon, they passed Dai. The person behind (the defendant) shouted, "Catch the thief!" and the person in front (the deceased) suddenly fell. The defendant caught up, pulled out a bayonet, and stabbed him seven times before fleeing. Dai was shocked and immediately chased after him. At the intersection of Xizang Road and Guling Road, he saw the defendant discard the murder weapon on the ground, which was picked up by a pedestrian and handed to the police. At that time, watchman No. 277 also helped chase the defendant and apprehended him at the intersection of Beijing Road and Xizang Road. However, the defendant still resisted, causing a knife sheath to fall from his waistband, which matched the bayonet handed over by the police. He was then taken to the police station. The defendant's clothes were also stained with blood, which was presented as evidence along with the murder weapon. Furthermore, the police station's investigation revealed that the defendant was instigated by Lu Baosheng to murder Jiang Haitao. Lu and Jiang were colleagues, both working as drivers in the First Special Court. Lu was suddenly dismissed by the court, and he suspected that Jiang had provoked this, causing him to harbor resentment. He instructed the defendant to murder Jiang, promising a reward of 200 yuan. Lu also provided the bayonet to the defendant. After the incident, the police went to Lu's home in Garden Square, Jin Shenfu Road, but could not find him. It was later learned that Lu, after being dismissed by the court, was working as a driver in the Second Special Court. They went to the Second Special Court to investigate. It was reported that Lu was indeed a driver, but he had taken sick leave two weeks prior and had not returned, making it impossible to arrest him. The widow, Jiang Zhu, also complained that her husband had died tragically and requested justice. Witnesses Dai Shengrong, Jin Kuitang, and Xie Huilian testified that they witnessed the situation at the time. Watchman No. 277 also testified that when apprehending the defendant, he punched the defendant in the back, and the knife sheath fell from his belt at that time. When questioned, the defendant denied killing Jiang Haitao, claiming that he was passing by the area that day and collided with Dai, resulting in four or five people beating him and handing him over to the police. The court appointed lawyer Wu Linkun to provide free legal defense for the defendant, arguing that according to the testimonies and records, the defendant did not have premeditated murder, and he should be sentenced for manslaughter. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, argued that the defendant had confessed in the police station, which was consistent with the facts, and the evidence was sufficient, requesting a death sentence according to the law.

<h3>Two Boys Run Over and Killed by Cars</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday at 3:50 PM, a Chinese area Concession No. 3743/International Settlement Concession No. 17146 automobile, traveling on Hengfeng Road and approaching the Qingzhao Road intersection, suddenly encountered a child running across the road. The driver, Wu Qiusheng, was unable to avoid the child due to excessive speed, resulting in the child being knocked down. The wheels ran over the child's head, and the child, wearing , died instantly. Police officer Wang Hanlin, who was on duty nearby, witnessed the incident and immediately stopped the vehicle and detained the driver, taking them to the Second Precinct of the Fourth District. After interrogation, a written report was submitted, and the deceased's family member, Dai Zhang, was summoned. She stated that the deceased was her son, named Shuangxi, sixteen years old.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday around 3:00 PM, in front of the Shanghai Electric Tramways Company on Yangshupu Road, a child, approximately ten years old, wearing a dark blue serge short shirt, white cloth pants, and satin shoes, resembling a child from a wealthy family, was wandering in the road. A cargo truck sped by and struck the child, running over his head, resulting in instant death. Western police officer No. 286 arrived on patrol, recorded the vehicle number, and sent the deceased child to the Tongren Hospital, before transferring him to the morgue to await examination by the court.</p>
<h3>Police Informant Killed</h3>
<p>▲ A Thief Apprehended in Xiaobangnei</p>
<p>The day before yesterday at approximately 3:00 PM, Wang Tianxiong, a patrol officer from the Second Precinct of the Fourth District of Zhabei, received a report from informant Dai Fushou that a notorious bandit was hiding in a straw shed behind the Chongxin Yarn Factory in Xiaobangnei, Laobasheng Road. Patrol Officer Wang immediately led the informant and Jiang Haifeng and others to the location. As soon as they approached the straw shed, they were spotted by the bandit, who immediately opened fire to resist arrest. The loud shot struck informant Dai Fushou in a vital area, causing him to fall to the ground and die instantly. Patrol Officer Wang and others immediately pursued the bandit to Xiaobangnei, where they apprehended a notorious bandit named Jin Dasanzi. As the location was in the Sixth District, they reported the incident to the Sixth District and then took the bandit back to the station. They immediately ordered the local land guard to report to the local court for an inquest. Yesterday, the court dispatched Prosecutor Yang with the coroner and others to the scene. The examination revealed that the deceased had two gunshot wounds in the chest, confirming that he had been shot to death. The family was instructed to claim the body for coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Woman Commits Suicide Due to Anger and Frustration</h3>
<p>Cui Qianji, from Hubei, 38 years old, operated a cigarette paper and money exchange stall at No. 107 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, at the Guangtailai Inn. His wife, Wei, also 38 and from the same hometown, lived with him and their three children (one daughter and two sons) in Room 87 on the third floor of Guangtailai. Wei, feeling emotionally distressed, secretly ingested raw opium the day before yesterday. The poison took effect at 8:00 PM that night, and her husband discovered her. She was sent to Renji Hospital, but due to the severity of the poisoning, treatment was ineffective. She died at 2:30 AM yesterday. The hospital notified the police, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for an autopsy. According to her husband, Cui Qianji, his wife's suicide was caused by Zhang Yuehua (from Guangdong), the wife of Wang Ziyuan (from Yunnan), who lived in Room 90. Wang held a position in the government and had gone to Yantai to seek employment, leaving his wife, Zhang, alone in Shanghai. Wei became familiar with Zhang due to their proximity. Seeing that Zhang was cooking her own meals, which was inconvenient, Wei kindly invited her to share meals with their family. However, a malicious person spread rumors, telling Zhang that Wei was saying that Zhang was stingy and not paying for her meals. Zhang, misled by these false words, did not investigate the truth and repeatedly insulted and scolded Wei. Wei, an honest person, felt unjustly accused and unable to vent her anger, leading her to suicidal thoughts. On the 17th, she went to the Bund on Fourth Avenue to throw herself into the Huangpu River, but a police officer spotted her, stopped her, and took her to the police station, who sent her home. After repeated persuasion, she remained unable to overcome her grief and did not abandon her suicidal intentions. The day before yesterday, she ingested poison and committed suicide. Yesterday, the police reported the incident to the Second Special Court, who dispatched Prosecutor Deng Baosun to the mortuary. After examining the body and hearing the husband's account of the deceased's unjust suicide, Deng ruled that Cui Wei had indeed died from ingesting poison. The body was claimed by her husband, Cui Qianji, for burial. It is reported that Zhang Yuehua, realizing her mistake, has asked someone to mediate a settlement with the deceased's family.</p>
<h3>Dong Kang Investigates Impersonation for Soliciting Donations</h3>
<p>A letter from Dong Kang to the Garrison Headquarters to investigate impersonation for soliciting donations: Respectfully to the Garrison Headquarters, I was recently shown a letter by Secretary Xu of your headquarters, inquiring about someone soliciting factory donations in my name. I was extremely surprised to hear this. Since my lawyer, Xie Zheng, settled in Shanghai, he has been engaged in editing and teaching and does not participate in any political or public welfare activities. There are many strange cases of fraud and deception in Shanghai. I urge your headquarters to conduct a thorough investigation and send the culprit to court for legal action. Furthermore, my residence's telephone number is 32371. If similar incidents occur again, please instruct the driver to inquire about the accurate number, and the truth will come to light. Respectfully, Lawyer Dong Kang of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, September 22nd.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Den Cracked on Jiangxi Road</h3>
<p>Chief Detective Lu Dagong of the General Police Station learned that someone was privately operating an opium den for people to smoke red pills at No. 250 Mingchang Lane, Jiangxi Road. He reported this to the First Special Court, which issued a search warrant. The day before yesterday, he, along with Western Detective Glover, secretly went to the location with Chinese and Western police officers and apprehended Chen Qingzeng (from Shanghai), who was operating the opium den, and a woman named Gu Zhou. Two respectable businessmen were caught in the act of smoking opium. One was Chen Yuanjin, from Ningbo, residing at No. 63 Huade Road, currently working as a clerk at the Welfare Company, and the other was Ni Zhiyao, also from Ningbo, residing at No. 57 Yipin Lane, Xindagu Road, currently working as a clerk at the British Tahe Foreign Firm, and the beloved son-in-law of Sun Yunqing, the famous Qinglian Pavilion Master in Shanghai. Another man named Ding Jinfa, also from Ningbo, was of unknown occupation. Two opium pipes, two opium lamps, and a large quantity of red pills were confiscated. The five opium offenders (male and female) were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Station Lawyer Qian Xunji presented the case, accusing Gu Zhou and Chen Qingzeng of violating Article 10 of the Prohibition of Opium Law, and Chen Yuanjin, Ni Zhiyao, and Ding Jinfa of violating Article 11 of the same law, requesting that they be punished according to the law. Presiding Judge Feng briefly questioned the defendants and sentenced Chen Qingzeng and Gu Zhou to eight months imprisonment each, with a fine of 80 yuan. Chen Yuanjin, Ni Zhiyao, and Ding Jinfa were each sentenced to one month imprisonment, with a fine of 40 yuan. The opium paraphernalia was confiscated.

<h3>Robbery at Ma Run Ji Fur Shop, Thieves Apprehended</h3>
<p>Ma Run Ji Fur Shop at No. 523 Guangdong Road was broken into by multiple robbers late at night on November 11, 1929 (Republic of China Year 18). Armed with handguns, they stole furs worth over 2,300 yuan and fled. The shop reported the incident with reports No. 1313 and No. 1473 to the Chinese police. Chinese police officers No. 1313 and No. 1473 were guarding outside, so when the thieves exited, they encountered the police. The thieves immediately opened fire, injuring a Chinese officer from No. 173 in the hand. The thieves scattered and escaped without being apprehended. Liu Junqing and Chen Yonggui, Chinese detectives from the Laozha Police Station, learned that a Shandong man named Chen Yuanzhen (also known as Chen Ganting) was the leader of the robbery and was hiding at No. 351 Qinghe Lane, Guangdong Road. They secretly went there at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday and apprehended Chen. They confiscated a fur coat lining and 352 yuan in cash, which were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Station Lawyer Qian Xunji prosecuted Chen according to Article 348 of the Criminal Code, stating that the police station had not yet fully investigated the case and requested an extension of one week. The plaintiff, Ma Shaoqing, testified that the defendant was the leader who directed the robbery. Criminal Court Judge Feng Shide briefly questioned the defendant and ordered him remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<h3>Suxin Crepe is Selling Well</h3>
<p>Among the new silk products for autumn, the Suxin crepe from Yuechang Wen Weaving Silk Factory is the most popular. Its unique advantages include its original design and its wrinkle-resistant quality, making it highly sought after by women.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>White Tung Oil Prices Have Stabilized</p>
<p>The market for white tung oil has long been weak and short-lived since the gradual decline in foreign sales from Hankou. There have been no significant improvements this year. Prices have hovered around 17-18 taels for foreign sales and 14-15 taels domestically. Compared to the price fluctuations of 7-8 taels or even 10 taels four or five years ago, the difference is like the sky and the earth. The rapid change in the market is truly immeasurable. It was recently reported that foreign firms sold some at 17 taels and 7 qian, but only in quantities of dozens or hundreds of tons. It is rumored that foreign firms still have some small appetite, but Chinese firms want to increase the price slightly, which foreign firms are unwilling to do. The increase would only be a few qian. This shows how small the price fluctuations are. Domestic sales fell to 14 taels and 4.6 qian, and sales were also low, making it difficult to determine prosperity or decline. However, prices are already low, and customers hope for improvement, so even if the price increases, it will be slight. Therefore, based on the current market, it is still difficult to turn things around. However, new goods will enter the market in the coming year when provinces report their quantities, which should bring changes. There is still more than a month before the new products are released. Because domestic sales have fallen, local firms in Shanghai are not paying attention to imports. Transactions in the market are even quieter than before. It is reported that 4,000 dan of Xiangtong oil have recently arrived in Hankou, with an opening price of 14 taels and 2 qian. The oil from this route is older and is intended for other destinations, not the Shanghai market, so there has been no procurement. However, the festival season has passed, and even if some supplies are desired, they must be selected from Hankou and Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Domestic Woolens Selling Well</p>
<p>Domestic woolens have been increasing in production recently, and sales have also been expanding. Woolens are currently selling particularly well. The wide and narrow striped camel woolens from Shanghai manufacturers such as Weilun, Tianxiang, Xianda, Shengda, Weiyi, Hongfa, Maoye, Dada, Tongyi, Tianyi, Pengchang, Dadong, Danan, Huadong, and Da Zhongguo, as well as the Guohua woolens from Tianjin Fuyuan and the Jin Fuyuan-brand otter woolens and rabbit woolens, are all selling extremely well in Shanghai, with both retail and wholesale transactions being very brisk. Prices range from 1 tael and 3 qian to 3 taels and 7 qian and a half. The first-grade domestic striped camel woolens from various brands are selling for 1 tael and 8 jian, the second grade for 1 tael and 6 qian and a half, the third grade for 1 tael and 5 qian, and the next grade for 1 tael and 1.2 qian. In recent days, various stores have been greatly reducing prices, selling for only 3 jiao and 5 fen per yard.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Tinplate Sales in Tianjin Reach 2,000 Boxes</p>
<p>▲ Tianjin Dealers Actively Trade Tinplate: Yesterday, the tinplate business in Tianjin was quite vibrant, with over 2,000 boxes traded. Due to the large volume of transactions, prices were relatively low, quoted at ten taels. However, retail sales still fetched ten taels and three or four qian. The inventory of bottom goods is already low, and people are optimistic. The stock market standard has a good chance of rising again.</p>
<p>▲ Green Lead Export Business Remains Strong: Export dealers still have a strong interest, and the situation remains solid, quoted at twelve taels and three qian. It is said that 600-700 bars were opened.</p>
<p>▲ New Foreign Silver Dollar Trading Weakens: Yesterday, various dealers in the Yangtze River, inland waterways, and Tianjin all had transactions, with a total of 700-800 dan opened. However, the market remains sluggish due to the abundance of goods.</p>
<p>▲ New Angle Iron Arrives Again: More than 1,000 dan of new goods arrived yesterday, making the market supply even more abundant. Although the iron bed dealers are still adding to their stock, the business from other customers is quite slow.</p>

<p>Discourse</p>
<h3>From Lu Genrong and Huang Huiru to the Second Son of the Swedish Crown Prince</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Since the Lu Genrong and Huang Huiru master-servant love affair occurred, newspapers have been vigorously publicizing it, and society is also paying close attention. I am truly puzzled. Jiangbei Xiaoshanzi and Li Xiuying, eloped together; Zhao Agou and Wang Qiaoyun, committed adultery in a certain hotel. Such news happens countless times every day in Shanghai's dazzling world, but it does not attract attention. Yet, the Lu-Huang case of master-servant love is regarded as a monumental event. This kind of thinking is inevitably somewhat old-fashioned.</p>
<p>All citizens of the Republic of China stand on an equal footing. This seems to be a statement in the Provisional Constitution. Therefore, the terms "master" and "servant" are no longer relevant. Freedom of marriage is also stipulated by the current laws of the Republic of China. Lu Genrong and Huang Huiru's freedom to love was originally a matter of course. However, Lu Genrong is slightly at fault, as he already has a wife at home, which seems to constitute bigamy. In fact, it is only a procedural error. Lu Genrong should have first declared his divorce from his wife and then engaged in this with Huang Huiru, which would have been more justified and legitimate.</p>
<p>The Lu-Huang master-servant love case, as reported in yesterday's newspaper, was declared innocent after a retrial by the Higher Court. This was because the original prosecutor, Jin Henian, disagreed with the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reviewed and ruled to reject the prosecutor's appeal. Now, Lu Genrong and Huang Huiru are like being granted imperial permission to marry, choosing a partner in court. A young couple can now live together freely, completely free. Therefore, the original prosecutor, Jin Henian, who wanted to cook the crane and burn the zither (separate the lovebirds), was guilty. The Supreme Court, by acting on behalf of heaven and rejecting the appeal, truly accumulated merit like building a pagoda.</p>
<p>Some say that although the Supreme Court rejected the appeal, it only recognized that Lu Genrong was not guilty of theft and did not recognize that Lu and Huang had the status of husband and wife and could cohabitate freely. But who is going to settle this account now? Others say that Lu Genrong still has a plain-looking wife at home, and the wife might become furious. In fact, Lu Genrong's wife is completely a village woman. She sees that her husband has brought back a charming and beautiful lady, and she feels very honored. Of course, she will voluntarily retreat, and she wouldn't dare to be jealous of the young lady.</p>
<p>The minds of our countrymen are so old-fashioned, and the minds of foreigners are even more severely old-fashioned. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the second son of the Swedish Crown Prince, Lennart, married the daughter of a businessman in London in March of this year, thereby losing his royal rights. The old-fashioned thinking of foreigners is evident here. Now, Lennart plans to open a theater in Stockholm, manage it himself, and serve as the protagonist in the plays. Lennart is willing to be deprived of his royal rights and marry a businesswoman. Originally, (it is easy to find priceless treasures, but difficult to find a true lover). I deeply admire Lennart's courage. I wonder if several gentlemen who read the newspaper, if they encountered such an either/or event, would be willing to be Lennart or willing to be the second son of the Crown Prince. I dare to ask.</p>

<h3>Etching (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shen Shui</p>
<p>Two, Silk Fabric Etching Method</p>
<p>The etching method for silk fabrics is roughly the same as for wool fabrics, and the etching agents used are also similar. Among them, hydrosulfite is the most common and important. However, tin salt etching agents are often used in color etching agents because tin salts can make colors lively and bright, so they are often used. Examples of their formulations are given below:</p>
<p>(A) Hydrosulfite Etching Agent</p>
<p>Hydrosulfite | 175 grams, British gum | 350 grams, water | 600 grams,</p>
<p>After printing, it only needs to be steam-bathed for five minutes to be taken out and washed clean.</p>
<p>(B) Tin Salt Color Etching Agent</p>
<p>Dye | 20 grams, vinegar | 120 grams</p>
<p>, gum water | 700 grams, tin salt | 100 grams, ammonia sulfate | 30 grams, citric acid | 20 grams,</p>
<p>After printing, it must be steam-bathed for half an hour before it can be taken out and washed clean.</p>
<p>Three, Cotton Fabric Etching</p>
<p>Cotton fabrics are most widely used, but we must also try our best to make them beautiful. Their dyeing method is also easier, so many dyes can be dyed on them, such as basic dyes, sulfide dyes, etc. Therefore, the chemical action of the added etching agent is also different, and different etching agents must be used to cope with them. There are many kinds, and now I can only talk about these two:</p>
<p>(1) Etching of Basic Dyes</p>
<p>Hydrosulfite cannot etch many basic dyes, so a chlorate must be used, which is very easy to etch basic dyes. However, if it is not used properly, it can easily damage the fabric. Now there is a kind of potassium sulfite that will not damage the fibers of the fabric. Now let's write the proportion of the ingredients below:</p>
<p>Potassium sulfite | 600 grams, British gum | 300 grams, water | 60 grams, concentrated caustic soda solution | 60 grams, sodium acetate | 20 grams,</p>
<p>Etch well, evaporate for five minutes, and it's good to wash it clean. The only disadvantage is that the application is not very wide. Among the basic dyes that can be etched, there are only magenta, blue, and peacock green and other colors.</p>
<p>(2) Etching of Sulfide Dyes</p>
<p>Many cloths are dyed with sulfide dyes, so its usage is simple and very durable. If you use hydrosulfite and tin salt etching to etch, it will oxidize again during washing, restoring its original color, so more chlorate alum etching agent is used. The formula is as follows:</p>
<p>British gum | 250 grams, chlorate alum solution 600 grams, sodium chlorate | 170 grams, potassium ferrocyanide | 175 grams,</p>
<p>If you want color etching, then the pigments used must be Fuji pigments such as chrome yellow, chrome orange, cinnabar, etc. can all be applied, except for these, they are not suitable. (End)</p>
<p>Improvement Society Discussion</p>
<h3>Should Lian Jun's Sunday Holiday Be Abolished?</h3>
<p>— Zhen Zhi</p>
<p>I previously published a suggestion in this column to abolish school Sunday holidays. The topic specifically marks the school</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>out, precisely because it is different from other occupations. For other occupations, the abolition of Sunday holidays is also harmful to society, but it is a secondary issue rather than a fundamental one. Lian Jun also clearly understood this sentiment in his article "Should Sunday Be Abolished?" published in this column yesterday, and explained my intention, saying that Zhen Zhi's intention is that our country cannot be strong because science is not prosperous. The reason science is not prosperous is that the people's level of knowledge is low. The reason the people's level of knowledge is low is that the people lack effort in learning. If you want the people to put in more effort, then the abolition of holidays is appropriate. Unexpectedly, the following text reverses the direction of "changing the strings and swiftly providing relief" and opposes the abolition of Sunday, and the topic only mentions "Should Sunday Be Abolished?", which, like the cited Russian newspaper, seems to have nothing to do with schools.</p>
<p>Countries that implement the Sunday holiday system produce talents in large numbers. In ancient times, our country did not implement the Sunday holiday system, but it also produced talents. If teachers do not have Sunday holidays, their lives will be very dull. I don't know if Confucius taught people tirelessly, but was there Sunday at that time? If you want teachers not to be dull and do not seek the progress of students, then holidays can be increased, so why bother to imitate Europe and the United States? Our country's national humiliation days are increasing every year. When we encounter them, we must take a holiday to express our condolences, which should also feel the need for dullness. Lian Jun also said that it is particularly obvious in a certain imperialist country with the most religious overtones, as mentioned by Zhen Zhi. Zhen Zhi has never said this, and I dare not take credit for it. Science is not prosperous, not because of the harm of Sunday holidays, but because of the improper handling of Sunday by the general public. I am not very knowledgeable about what the word "handling" means here. I will tentatively interpret it as "placement." Then Lian Jun is a practitioner of the new calendar. Furthermore, tentatively interpret it as the word "action." I originally advocated the abolition because the people of the country do not use it well and cannot use it well. It is not because of choking and abolishing food. In European and American countries, they first used Sunday holidays as a religious system, which has nothing to do with the material civilization of science. Later, science became prosperous, and Sunday holidays were sufficient to assist the development of science. Looking back at our country, how is the construction? How is science? If we do not increase the time to seek knowledge and increase production at this time, and implement the Sunday holiday system, then we are running counter to each other.</p>
<p>As for saying that the abolition is harmful to students, the reason is that low-ability students can use their holiday time to put more effort into their homework in order to catch up with the smart ones. If this kind of self-taught without a teacher is possible, then why do teachers need to exist, and why do schools need to exist? Because Sunday holidays are harmful to vocational studies, otherwise, why would Soviet Russia change to a continuous work week? The cited Soviet Russian newspapers testify that the meaning in it is biased towards the views of couples following each other and filial piety towards parents. It should be known that these things can be done anytime and anywhere and cannot be said to be a reason for opposition, which is tantamount to exposing one's own shortcomings.</p>
<p>However, since it is a discussion society, there should be repeated refutations of the proposed opinions, which further demonstrates the soundness of the discussion society and the value of the proposed opinions. Lian Jun's intention is not too critical. I am afraid that the people's knowledge is shallow and their prejudice will be increased by Lian Jun's words.</p>

<h3>A Domestic All-Out Brawl</h3>
<p>— Jing Yu</p>
<p>The neighbor Mr. Huang's family, the day before yesterday afternoon, the Yan family, young and old, played an all-out brawl, causing chaos in the house, and the surrounding people could not rest.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang is from a well-off family, with a wife and a concubine, and above him is an old mother, and below him are children. Among ordinary people, he can be considered blessed!</p>
<p>His wife was also married from a wealthy family. After entering the house, she gave birth to several daughters. She was eager for a son, so she encouraged her husband to bring back her family's maid, A Ying, and take her as a concubine.</p>
<p>She helped her husband marry a mistress, and at the same time, she became pregnant herself. After ten months of pregnancy, she actually gave birth to a son in one fell swoop. (Having a son is the most satisfying thing) The joy in her heart can be imagined.</p>
<p>From then on, she became arrogant and often humiliated A Ying. The old lady did not approve of her behavior and loved A Ying especially. Therefore, conflicts often arose between the wife, concubine, and daughter-in-law. Mr. Huang mediated among them and took his wife and children to live in another residence, so that A Ying could live with the old lady in the old house and serve her day and night.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang's eldest daughter, Miss Xian, was studying at XX middle school. The day before yesterday, she asked for leave to return home and went to her grandmother's place to ask about her well-being. The old lady asked her to have lunch, and everyone ate at the same table. A Ying ate a bowl and got up to add rice at the side table. Miss Xian secretly used her toes to hook the stool she was sitting on under the table. A Ying came back with rice and, without paying attention, sat on empty air, fell, and broke the rice bowl into pieces. She was so ashamed that she didn't know whether to cry or laugh. She couldn't help but curse:</p>
<p>(Pimping my mother, who moved my stool?) In fact, she also knew that it was Miss Xian's mischief, but she didn't want to expose it in person. However, Miss Xian was not willing to show weakness and immediately questioned her sternly:</p>
<p>(You want to pimp my mother? My mother is over there, I'll drag you to pimp her!) While saying this, she started to drag her and slapped her. How could A Ying give up? She also returned the slap. So you dragged me, and I pulled you, twisting into a ball.</p>
<p>Miss Xian's mother got the news and rushed over immediately to help her daughter participate in the battle. The old lady saw that A Ying's two fists could not defeat four hands and was afraid that she would suffer. She pretended to dissuade them, but secretly pulled the mother and daughter's elbows and helped A Ying. At this time, the family of four got into a pile and fought so hard that flowers and water fell, and the bowls on the table were also broken into snowflakes. Later, Mr. Huang saw that the noise was too much and it spread out, which was not decent. He had no choice but to act as an intermediary and mediate between the two sides. He apologized to his mother and wife on behalf of the other. They simply shouted a few times and remained silent. This storm of overturning rivers and seas finally subsided!</p>
<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic People Attract Too Much Trouble</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>Zhang and Li were the closest friends in school. No matter what happened, everyone exchanged information and helped each other, so their friendship could be said to be as close as brothers!</p>
<p>In the last quarter of last year, both of them graduated from XX middle school. Because they were both from poor families, they could not afford to go to school and were busy looking for jobs to solve the bread problem. Soon, Zhang found a position in the business world. Li did not find an opportunity and had to stay at home. Their families were close to each other, so when Zhang set out, he solemnly asked Li to take care of his family. Li also readily agreed, so Zhang went out, and Li often went to Zhang's house to see if his family was safe and sound. He would write a letter to Zhang to report everything he knew, so that he could feel at ease in a foreign land and also show that he had not failed his confidant's entrustment! One day, Li went to Zhang's house and found that Zhang's wife had improper behavior, and the rumors outside were also rampant. He thought that Zhang had repeatedly asked him to pay attention to everything, no matter how big or small, and report it to him. Now that he had discovered this unfortunate event concerning his own reputation, he had to write to him immediately, and he also heard that the adulterer was a famous local hooligan, so he should warn him to be prepared, lest something go wrong. So he wrote a quick letter, reporting everything in detail, and also persuaded him to be optimistic, not to be sad, and hoped that he would quickly find a way to deal with this unfortunate matter!</p>
<p>Zhang received this shocking report like a bolt from the blue. He was filled with jealousy and immediately returned home as fast as he could. When he got home, he questioned her. Of course, she denied it outright and also inquired about the source of his information!</p>
<p>He stayed at home for a few days. His wife had mysterious methods and sweet words, and she probed him for this information on the pillow. After a burst of sweet talk, he honestly told her what Li had reported. When she heard that it was Li's report, she hated Li to the core and came up with a brilliant plan to shift the blame to others. She said to him: (How can you believe Lao Li's nonsense? He has bad intentions himself and often comes to flirt with me. I scolded him several times, so he used this vicious method to retaliate. You are confused and fell for his trick!) When he heard this, he believed it to be true and immediately transferred his hatred for her to Li!</p>
<p>In a few days, he was actually instigated by her and sued Li in court for attempted rape and defamation, and used the letter Li gave him as evidence. When Li learned of this news, he was so angry (that he ate coptis with a mute, unable to express his suffering). He deeply regretted being enthusiastic, which led to attracting trouble. This matter has not been resolved yet. I think in today's world, only (everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door and does not care about the frost on other people's roofs) can avoid causing trouble. The above matter of Li is also a clear proof! Because this matter can serve as a warning to young people who are not careful in handling affairs, so I record it.</p>
<p>Such a Family</p>
<h3>Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>After Mr. Li died, the Li family's household affairs were completely controlled by the eldest son. Of course, the younger siblings had to obey him under the creed of (the eldest brother is like a father), and even the old Mrs. Li obeyed him in accordance with the ancient teachings of (a wife follows her son after her husband dies). Then this eldest son of the Li family had in fact become the head of the family.</p>
<p>The eldest son of the Li family knew very well how to use his authority. This was the most intelligent and proud thing about him. For example, regarding the marriage of his second sister, he dared to insist on his own opinion to his mother:</p>
<p>(In any case, the second sister has to get married, so Mr. Luo, although he is a little older, has a lifelong support, and he doesn't have to worry about eating or living. Isn't that okay?)</p>
<p>So the mother had to say gently:</p>
<p>(But you have to know that your sister is not willing after all!)</p>
<p>(But I have already promised him, because he is my best friend.)</p>
<p>The young master walked out angrily, leaving the old mother to shed tears as she watched his back. She thought:</p>
<p>(How can my daughter marry a businessman in his thirties who already has several children? Is it possible that no one wants my girl?)</p>
<p>So the mother watched her daughter shed tears, and the second young lady cried bitterly in the arms of old Mrs. Li. It was hard for the mother to hold back her tears and say:</p>
<p>(Child! Although Mr. Luo's family wealth is several times better than ours, he is too old and has been married before. Of course, I don't want you to marry him either, but your eldest brother has already allowed him... How can I say anything? If your father were still alive, it wouldn't be like this!)</p>
<p>As she spoke, tears poured down like rain again. Afterwards, she sobbed again and said:</p>
<p>(This is just your fate, what can a mother do?)</p>
<p>Poor second young lady just cried and entangled her mother as she cried.</p>
<p>In the end, the mother and daughter succumbed (under the pressure of the head of the family).</p>
