<p>時評</p>
<h3>法國選舉與代議政治翰</h3>
<p>法國衆議院之選舉。經五月一日與八日兩次投票之結果。我人所可略知者。爲左傾勢力之抬頭。右傾勢力之降落。中間雖經總統之慘變。然於選舉。毫不受其影響。蓋環境所趨。勢使然也。　　自歐戰以還。法國朝野所致力者。厥惟兩端。曰如何恢復法國之元氣。曰如何造成法國之繁榮。舉凡黨派之興落。政府之更迭。莫不以斯爲轉移。自一九二四年左派組閣失敗後。政權就落於右派之手。而幕前幕後。皆有普恩加賚之發縱指使。一九二六年以後。普氏更以（神聖聨合）（國民内閣）爲號召。至一九二八年。始克完成法郎平準之大業。惟以法國黨派紛岐。雖有普氏之鐵腕。經過無數阻折。亦終難造成集中悠久之勢力。故國民内閣之運命。屢遭摧殘。至一九二九年十月。即已告終。從此以後。法國又重復朝野相爭之局面。　　自一九二八年法郎價格平準以後。法國産業漸興。國民日富。至於最近。儼然稱多金之國。幾與金圓之美國。並駕齊驅。但賠償問題。戰債問題。仍未得切實之解决。此爲法國最可憂慮之事。自一九三○年世界經濟恐慌開始以後。德國經濟。愈益紊亂。賠償與戰債問題。遂益荆棘横生。而法國一刹那之繁榮亦岌岌不可終日。從此泰狄歐所領袖之右傾諸派。自鳴得意之種種功業。亦日趨於幻滅。且國庫空虚。財政支絀。捐税减削之預允。已成空頭支票。額外支出之增加。更溢出乎預算。操切之農業政策。幾將引起城市對農村之反抗。而積極之關税政策。更將加重消費人之負擔。凡此諸端。皆足以引起法國國内政治之不安。至其對於國際政策。近一年來。亦抱持歐陸盟主之雄心。以致國際環境。亦不能如前順利。而軍縮問題之日趨黯淡。多腦河經濟問題之一度破裂賠償與戰債問題之迄未解决。凡此種種。皆足以顯示法國國際政策前途之困難也因國内外政治之不安。致右派之信用日墮而左傾勢力。遂得以乘機抬頭矣。　　法國爲議會政治。故此次元首之更迭。與政治之晦明。無甚關係。至議會則爲多黨所造成。政治集團。林林總總。鮮有集中强固之勢力。而閣潮起伏。政治靡常。尤爲代議政治摇動之根因。即自一九二八年以來。内閣更迭。已有十次之多。而歷届内閣。從無單獨主持之組織。莫不就一時臭味之相投。作苟且勉强之結合。今泰狄歐所領袖之右傾勢力。旣遭受本届選舉之打擊。自無戀棧之希望。新總統就任後。泰氏勢必提出辭職。則赫里歐之東山再起。亦意中事耳。惟赫氏主持之激進社會黨與純社會黨。在行動之策略上。亦殊有出入。社會黨素以不妥協著。抱（不得絶對多數决不組閣）之旨。儼然欲在小黨林立之中。崛起而成一政綱顯明的大黨。故是否肯抛棄主張。與激進社會黨聨合組閣。亦尚難言。則赫氏或將轉送秋波於中派。與泰狄歐聨手而成非左非右之混合政府。亦未可知也。　　總之法國政治進展之迂緩。原因甚多。决難因本届選舉而告一段落。其最重要者。即小黨林立之弊不去。則中堅之力量不生。中堅之力量不生。則政治平衡之局面終不可得。而代議政治之危機。亦將愈益擴大。此種結論。實爲法國政治經騐所賜給我人者也。</p>

<h3>上週美棉低後回漲</h3>
<p>五月六日紐約電告一週棉市狀况云、本週棉市初覺疲弱、後稍回漲、因農務局已宣佈關於出售其存棉之政策、一般人認爲有建設性質也、但棉市仍因國會有數種議案、尚未决定、故終未穏定、但買風息時、略有售出、市價即形鬆動、本週初之積極售出、其中有掩護紗廠存棉或存貨之套賣交易蓋其時有棉貨需求依然不振、國内棉廠將再减産之説也舊多頭亦了結不少、而南方有現貨者或亦套出若干、惟南方基礎價格、已由穏而堅傳説日商在西南收買、温度不高、固妨礙發芽及棉子發育、但近來雨量已改善表示之狀况絲茶</p>

<h3>湖州毛茶大批到滬</h3>
<p>昨日義同興·同益豐等茶棧、由湖州運來毛茶二百餘包、來路山價、扯盤均須九十四五元、成本至爲鉅大、現各茶棧已積極僱工趕製、以應市銷云、</p>
<h3>婺源茶産蝕收</h3>
<p>世界最歡迎之婺源高莊綠茶、近日已開始採製、兼之兩日來天怱暴熱異常、昨（三日）午又降雨雹、茶芽發育極速、前之爲寒撳歛之嫩尖、今亦猛茁抽長、山户深慮茶出齊頭、採製不及、紛紛僱工帮　、今日（四日）起各鄉已齊帮開圍、但據山户估算生産數量、　較往年收成折欠、且本年茶米工資物價俱昻、號方又無欵貨濟、山户受經濟緊迫、莫不呌苦、預料將來山價、非但不能較舊减少、或須提高亦未可知、</p>
<h3>洋莊絲市日呈暗淡</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、續呈暗淡、緣歐美生絲市塲幾致日絲侵銷殆盡、廠經等開價奇小、而現銷不動、滬埠歐美祗連納進鐵機頂頭號十三至十五條份川黄廠經十四包、價扯六百四十五兩、克昌進蔚義長牌頭號過盆黄粗絲五包、價三百四十兩、聞均補空交易云、糧食</p>

<h3>洋米激漲後之反動</h3>
<p>▲小絞回小一角　　昨日洋米市况、因前二天行情激漲三四角後、本客嫌其價大、均爲觀望不辦、漢口一路、去胃尚殷、但自本週起增加水脚後、均停手觀望、因此晨間市形甚疲、各米均疲小一角左右、午刻有崇明及内地各路與本街等趁小搜買、行情始得轉站、計開出小絞二千包、價十元零六角三分至十元零四角、陳小絞十元零一角七分、敏黨五百包、價十元零八角半至十元零七角半、小絞糙五百包、價九元六角、回籠期小絞成交二百噸、五月份五兩零八分、比前日亦帶小二三分云、</p>

<h3>扶桑雜記（下）</h3>
<p>— 歐圻</p>
<p>東京近建一軍神廟。規模宏大。係紀念滬戰陣亡之某大將。一日詢諸某日友曰。貴國之軍神。係指何人。日友曰。即陸相派赴上海之菱刈隆也。因其勇敢善戰。日俄之役。頗著勞績。故國人（指日本）皆稱之爲軍神。又稱國寳。由此可見菱刈已在滬戰陣亡。憶三月一日我軍撤退時。上海盛傳白川在瀏河陣亡。殆即菱刈之誤也。　　日本内部軍閥專權。時起糾紛。犬養内閣。不啻爲一傀儡。滬戰旣予日軍一重創。犬養即痛斥荒木等之窮兵黷武。某日往見荒木。力勸對華和好。且曰幣原前謂侵華如自吞炸彈。汝今可以知矣。荒木大窘。怒曰。汝何人也。我皇軍屬於天皇。屬於陸相。汝内閣何得過問。因披其頰。並拔槍對之。犬養無法。悻悻而去。　　至於我華人之旅日者。自滬戰起後。備受殘害。每行至路中。輒被日浪人毆擊或唾駡。樓窗内亦常擲下泥石果皮或污水。種種侮辱。不一而足。甚至有被殺害者。警察亦不之顧。本年二月間。敝店夥友劉君。因與日浪人口角。次日劉君出外購菜。即被日浪人扭去。音息杳然。當即報告警局。亦無所獲。半月後忽在附近浜内發見劉君頭顱。復投報警局。警局即佯稱兇手已緝獲法辦。不料此訊爲浪人得息。遂於當夜集衆持械破門而入。搗毁器具。毆傷店夥。貨物被刦一空。本人因越牆奔逃。得免於難。及至巡捕到來。若輩已呼嘯而去。嗚呼。吾國未亡而我僑胞已深受亡國切膚之痛矣。</p>
<h3>綠俄與不祥之數</h3>
<p>— 開煦</p>
<p>此次法國總統杜美爾氏被剌。全球震悼。其對於兇手之種種。當然亦爲舉世所屬目。查兇手戈古洛夫爲俄人。惟據其妻所供。戈氏旣非赤俄。亦非白俄。而爲綠俄。蓋彼雖對於共産制度。深惡而痛恨。然亦不主張恢復昔日俄皇之專制。於是乃有綠俄黨之名稱。此種綠俄。向無政治之主張。彼等之所求者。不過欲安居樂業。不受政治之牽制。現俄籍人氏之被逐出國。僑居四方者。多屬此種人。名之曰綠俄。然亦不必有所組織也。夫綠色表示慘淡悲苦。亦表示妬忌懷恨。蓋亦今世禍亂相承。怨毒之氣磅礴於大地。偶爲所中即足以掀起軒然大波。法總統亦不過偶觸之。竟因此喪生。吾爲杜氏悲。亦爲世界前途懼。　　法總統杜美爾爲法國第十三任元首。其當選之日。爲去歲五月十三日。而其被剌之日。適爲星期五。夫十三爲西方不吉之數。昔耶穌末次聚讌。同席十三人。嗣後歷代相傳。均以十三爲不吉。今醫院中不設十三號病房者。即此意也。再則五數。亦屬不祥。故五月及星期五。均認爲含有不吉之意味者。今杜美爾以五月十三日當選總統。復以翌年五月中之星期五。被狂人所狙擊。豈迷信之事有可徴耶。抑亦偶然數奇之相循耶。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>政政府簽訂的所謂（停戰協定），雖經全國否認，事實上，不過表現民意而已！但從此可以證明政府對日交涉，始終是退讓，是屈服，没有抵抗的决心，只有簽訂賣國條約的準備！我們痛恨袁世凱簽訂二十一條，其實黨治之下，比袁氏專政時代，相去幾何？唉！政府與民衆背道而馳，（共赴國難），簡直是夢話！　　有人説：（日本海陸空軍得意洋洋的凱旋了！）其實他們何嘗是歸國？是開赴我們的東北，繼續侵略，對義勇軍施以更有力的壓迫罷了。簽訂了（停戰協定），日軍纔有更進一步的計劃，這豈不是政府自惹其禍？上海和緩，東北吃緊。，榆關形勢險惡，山海關朝夕不保，不知政府對此又作何態度？</p>
<h3>施肇䕫之楊花詩</h3>
<p>— 浮名</p>
<p>現隨顧維鈞出關之中國代表秘書施肇䕫氏。不知者每以其姓名之同。疑爲與（施肇基）一家。其實非也。施肇䕫爲維揚人。别字德潛。蚤歲游美。因與顧氏結識。頗爲顧所器重。在北京政府時代。顧任閣揆。曾簡施爲國務院秘書廳帮辦。去歲顧任外交部長。施膺總務司長兼典職科長之職。雖爲時不久。而顧之應酬筆墨。多出於施手。施中英文均擅長。人亦頗風雅。憶其早年所吟楊花詩一律。堪稱絶唱。曾刊於錦囊詩集中。茲特轉錄於下。　　任有千絲不繫身。滿天飛散綠初匀。浮生未定去來跡。倩影猶欺離别人。到處飄零等遊子。了無情緒送殘春。江南狼藉風流種。半作青萍半作塵。　　按此詩頗有感慨。其項腹兩聨。正不啻爲今日出關情形寫照。如施氏在此風塵僕僕中。見而誦之。吾料其必增今昔之感也</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（四八）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第六回可憐同夢夜迫爲床下盟猶憶初戀時負卻窗約</p>
<p>的一聲鐵門打開了來。軍警們如狼似虎的自内衝出。有的開槍。有的揮棍。有的舞刀。有的捉人。便把學生們衝得七零八落。雞飛鴨走。打死了幾個。打傷的更多。被捉的也不少。此外還有旗幟傳單棍子手杖帽子圍巾手磁靴鞋那一類的雜件兒。遺棄得徧地都是。祗造成功一個永遠要作紀念的四二七慘案。在這當兒。李問霞照例擔任着女校代表。身臨前線。别人都正在向後轉跑了。伊却還是氣冲冲地高喊上前。呌大家不要怕死。忽地有一個兵追了來。一剌刀將伊身旁一位女同學剌倒。噴出幾股鮮紅的血伊奮不顧身的拚作犧牲。反撲向那野獸般的兵士面前去。想搶奪那支槍桿。却不料那剌刀尖早已迫近了伊的眉睫。説時遲。那時快。安玉田這天也在行列中參加。一眼瞥見伊岌岌可危。搶前解救。猛一箭步　來。倒眞個把那槍桿攔腰抓牢。就祇任那剌刀尖兒在李問霞左肩窩下劃破一條兩寸來寛的口子。并没曾洞穿伊的胸脯。却没防到身旁另有個警士。高舉起槍桿上木托在他頭上猛敲了個正著。登時也頭破血流掛上了彩。幸虧他體質堅强。捱了這下打繫。居然還没暈倒。略定了定神。使出平日在家鄉所練過的武技來應付。突然把雙手一鬆。就地又一蹲身形甩了個掃蹚腿。竟把那一兵一警都猝不及防的雙雙踤跌在地。他不敢戀戰。趁此扶了李問霞拔脚便跑找。到一家醫院去療治創傷。在醫院裏將養了十來天。他倆同病相憐交互慰藉。晨昏把晤。耳鬢厮磨。遂因患難之交。更結纏綿之愛。安玉田那時還是破題兒嘗著這初戀滋味。熱情自是火熾。李問霞也因身世凄凉。亟想得有依托。就在一個月明如水的幽夜裏。同倚在醫院樓上一處玻窗前頭。指著天畔銀河。悄悄的於口頭上訂下個同心的婚約。但安玉田附帶另有個叮囑。須等待幾時回家去禀明堂上得著允許以後。才能對外宣布。祗是後來爲了家鄉鬧匪回去有一段早道很難走。安玉田總淹留在北京。就一向保住了這段秘密。</p>

<p>講到水門汀的用途，這是誰都知道的，他於近代的建築工程上，算是一件不可缺的原料，所以要知道一國物質文明的進展程度怎樣？看他每年消費的水門汀量就得了，　　吾國始有水門汀廠，遠在光緒末年，第一家爲華商啓新公司，到現在共有啓新·華記·士敏土·華商·中國·致敬等六家，每年出産量約爲三百二十六萬桶，但是吾國因物質文明漸漸進步、需要上還不止此數，所以每年仰給於舶來品的，爲數還達三百餘兩（關銀兩）之多，　　中國謂之水門汀，即英文中Cement之譯音，又名水泥，種類分天然産NaturalCemet撲脱蘭PdrotlanCement火山灰Puzzolanea等三類，美法天然産頗多，意大利火山灰亦豐，唯世界所産的水門汀，大都屬撲脱蘭類也，　　水泥製造的原料，爲石膏，石灰，黏土等三物，製造的方法，分濕法和乾法兩種，　　濕法的製造，較乾法爲便易，第一步先將原料搗成粉末，配成適當成分之粘泥後，乃用吹氣力送入旋轉爐内製煉，煉出这塊粒，用機依次打成細末即成，　　至於乾的製法，似較濕法爲麻繁，因爲須先將原料烘乾成細末，製成適當的磚塊後，再至各式的煉爐（如Schnneider式Hoffmann式是）内燒煉，經過燒煉的磚塊，又再行搗成細末後方成，兩者的製法，亦各有其利弊所在，唯若用較濕的原料，則以乾法製較佳，若用較乾的原料，那以濕法製較爲便易而經濟了，　　至於各國的産量，按照各國户口平均支配起來，那美國每人出産水泥一，四六桶，比國每人二桶，丹麥每人一桶，那威每人○·八桶，德國每人○·七桶，日本每人一三一·六磅·而吾國每人僅有三磅（按每桶之容量通常爲一三一·六磅）相形之下，吾國産業之落後，從可見矣，！　　臨了！水門汀事業，確爲國家的基本工業，和三酸工業之重要，實無軒輊，先總理在建國大綱上，也討論及此，其重要可想，</p>

<p>這是初夏酷熱的午晝。都市的空氣，十分不夠人呼吸。小菜塲的周圍充溢着熱蒸蒸的疲倦不死的暑氣。　　一個四十幾歲的婦人，帶着她被汗點流成斑點的憂愁的面孔以及藏著破布和針線的籃子，在貼緊牆壁坐着而守候着爲别人補綴衣襪。　　（替我補一補這個袋袋，多少錢？）一個小商人在向她示著自己的破衣服，這是她現在所切誠希望的機會了。　　（隨便你拿罷，先生！）他馬上在頭上取下針線了，找出了合式的布片，小心的，一針復一針。　　（你一天她做多少錢生活？）主僱在似乎懇切的發問。　　（啊！没有生意啊！）顫抖的聲音在她喉頭吐出。　　（那末可夠吃飯呢？）　　（不過是五六個大餅罷了。····同時家裏還有小孩。）　　（啊？眞是可憐哩！）　　一抹同情落在她的心頭，這使她感激得幾站流出涙來。於是她更仔細的爲他補綴，而且是非常牢固，不久，衣服補綴好了，她接上深深地呼了一口氣·隨後她伸手接受了所應得的工資。　　（三個銅板？先生！）這使她大大地失望了。　　（你要多少？三個銅板還不夠嗎？）他立刻換上鬼臉了。　　這是無論如何不依的，雖然他已在走她還得跟著他喊，其後她總算多得著了一個。他想··　　（啊！要想他們會可憐我，眞是不會有的事哩！）</p>

<p>▲慰問傷兵　　將暗未暗的病房中，大家（病人）多隨便躺着，只一個身體較好的坐着在室中的籐椅上，他戴着一個奇怪的帽子，｜這時，天是晚了，晚飯已吃過，　　在這當兒，外邊走進三個摩登女士，大家一望而知是來慰問傷兵的，｜因爲大家認得出已是來過幾趟了，　　其中一個，帶着高興的神氣，指着坐在籐椅上的病人，對同來的説，　　（看！他不是被打壞了腦子的嗎？那個坐着，戴帽子的，）　　那個病人聽了，從椅上直跳起來駡道，　　（好！放你什麽狐狸屁，腦子打壞了還能坐在這裏嗎？你的眼睛難道瞎了嗎？你不是害了神經病嗎？你們這些無恥的狐狸精説什麽慰問傷兵，其實還不是來看熱鬧的嗎，又駡道··　　靠着有錢，飽食無事，還不算數，面上塗滿了胭脂，脚下穿了高跟皮鞋，出來東游西蕩的獻醜，上海之所以成爲惡濁世界，正是你們這般東西造成的，你們這些狐狸精呀！眞是誤人不淺，　　並且這是什麽時候了，你們還到這裏來，想趕什麽？醫院裏的規矩，你們還不知道嗎？二點到四點鐘會客，現在是什麽時候了！　　小姐（指看護）！現在是什麽時候了？這些狐狸精，怎的放她們進來，還不快趕出去，不是要了我們的命嗎？　　他越是駡得起勁，她們越是低下頭去，羞慚得無地自容，更不知怎樣是好，　　幸虧看護小姐聽得駡聲，連忙走來，把她們引了出去，作爲收塲，　　至於這邊的大衆呢，只是捧腹大笑，　　｜在Ｘ醫院記，｜｜上海的禮贊老湯某夏夜××酒排間中底一隅。</p>
<p>醉生夢死</p>
<h3>上海的禮贊</h3>
<p>— 老湯</p>
<p>這裏有三個人··一個律師，一個地産商，一個舞塲中的舞女。他們在這音樂的波浪中，在酒氣的熏陶中，在雪花膏司丹康的香氣中，各自斟滿了自己的杯，各自歌頌這不夜之城的上海。　　一縷柔美得令人盪魂的聲音，從那舞星的珠喉櫻唇中散出來··（美麗啊，上海！這裏有人影的憬憧，肉　　體的顫動，和那樂聲的琤琮。來吧！震起我們的脚踵，我們緊貼着胸，磨擦着乳峯！看啊！燈光朦朦。腰兒玲瓏。我們要做那二十世紀的嬌兒，做這不夜之城的上海底主人翁！）　　（看啊！這地圖就是不夜之城的上海）。地産商攤開了手中的上海地圖後這樣説··（這條是南京路，那邊是黄浦灘，數十年前這裏還是一堆堆的墳坵山，這是未來的市中心區江灣，不久的將來，現在值一千元的要漲到幾萬萬！這是多麽值得啊，投資地産！）　　最後，那律師撥開了（話匣子）的機關，像出庭辯論似的得意地呼喊··　　（且慢！上海的偉大何嘗似你們所説的一班？快！翻開你們的報紙來！這是離婚，這是强姦，黑沉沉地排滿了這一版。在上海，若没有請常年法律顧問的，便欲做胯下的弱者！有這特色的才是不夜之城的上海。）</p>
<p>麵色問題</p>
<h3>一個小學教師</h3>
<p>— 冰</p>
<p>昨天，接到我家裏的一封信，向我要二十塊錢，來維持生活，並且要即刻的寄回去，　　本來，我的家裏，每月我祇少總得要寄回去十幾塊錢，否則，他們簡直不能活命，　　我，是一個坐冷板凳，吃粉筆屑的號稱神聖的小學教師，每月的薪金，本來有二十幾塊錢，除了六七元的膳費和三四元的零用外，一月還可有十幾塊錢好多，　　可是現在，却不行了，自暴日侵滬後，一切的一切，都抱了緊縮政策，吃教育飯的人，當然也不能例外，每月祇發些維持費，名其實爲維持費，而還不能維持一個人的生活，（依現在的生活程度）那裏還有錢能寄回去呢？雖是到校將近三月，可是家裏的討錢信，接二連三的來了，而且是寫得萬分的急切，我有什麽法子呢？向校長説吧，校長也説没有辦法，向朋友去借吧，朋友是和我同病，完了！還有什麽法子呢？　　啊！一個吃開口飯神聖小學教師的我，將怎樣呢？在接到我的家裏的要錢信之後！　　一陣的雷聲，頓時落下了傾盆的大雨，眼前愈覺得黑暗，</p>

<h3>上海法租界</h3>
<h3>最近汽車統計</h3>

<h3>汽車之安全問題黄影呆</h3>
<p>汽車一物。雖爲交通利器。而肇禍之易。殺人之多。亦爲任何交通器具所不及。是故駕車之人。莫不以安全問題。爲駕車時主要之事項。然一經實地試騐。則行車而欲保安全。則又爲困難之事矣。駛車外出。倘隨處能注意安全問題。則我人固無所指謪矣。蓋駕車而不注意安全。一經肇事。當局即可以犯罪判之。近來各汽車廠。對於安全問題。莫不竭力注意。如車行於鬧市之中。則制輪有力。車燈明亮。以及其他安全器物之供應。其目的皆在减少肇禍事件。而事實上則汽車之殺人肇禍。仍日見增多也。　　欲求避除汽車之肇禍。此中有一極便之方法。駕車之人。固任何人可行之也。其法爲何。即駕車之時。隨時隨地能注意安全問題是也。苟人人而能在駛車之時。注意前進之方向。則種種禍患。立可消滅。以至於最小之限度。此外另有一事。即行路者也。蓋汽車之殺人肇禍。未必皆因駕車人之不愼而釀成。其中亦不免有行路之人。不知注意而被汽車輾傷者。故欲求汽車之避免禍患。其責任雖一半應由駕車人負擔。而一半則在行路者身上也。苟行路之人。能注意車輛之來往。不入行車軌内。則各種禍患。必因而减少矣。　　汽車之禍患。所以釀成者。其中重要原因。即在駕駛之疎忽。速力之過快。駕駛人技術之不熟。標燈及符號之生疎。在高原道路之上。雖寛闊而較爲便利。而製造汽車之廠家。近復利用最高之速率。然過快之速率。可免則免。不可任意加速也。是故謹愼從事之人。駕車之時。必不願速率過快。蓋過快之速率。即可産生種種禍患。駕車而任意加速。不啻幸災樂禍耳。　　駕車之時。欲求免於肇禍。方法之多。固非筆墨所能盡述。當行車於途中也。駕駛之時。隨時應注意車内各種機件。是否可靠。此爲主要之事。然後運用其靈敏之手術。使速率能在中庸之處。並隨時提防禍患之發生。如駕車之人。行車前進。關於四周或路角之處。不能細察物件。則應鳴以喇叭。或暫行停車。交叉之點。尤應注意。而轉灣之時。更應减慢速率也。此外避禍之方法甚多。不能爲讀者盡述。在駕車人之隨機應變耳。消息</p>

<h3>French Elections and the Epitome of Representative Politics</h3>
<p>The French Chamber of Deputies elections, after the two rounds of voting on May 1st and 8th, have revealed what we can roughly perceive as the rise of left-leaning forces and the decline of right-leaning forces. Although the President's tragic change occurred in the middle, it did not affect the election in the slightest. This is because the trend of the environment is compelling.  Since the end of the European War, what the French government and public have been striving for are only two goals: how to restore France's vitality and how to create France's prosperity. All the rise and fall of parties and the change of governments are based on this. After the failure of the left-wing cabinet in 1924, the power fell into the hands of the right-wing, and behind the scenes, there was always Poincaré’s direction. After 1926, Mr. Poincaré even used the "Sacred Union" and "National Cabinet" as slogans. It was not until 1928 that he completed the great task of stabilizing the franc. However, due to the division of French parties, even with Mr. Poincaré's iron fist, after countless obstacles, it was still difficult to create a concentrated and lasting force. Therefore, the fate of the National Cabinet was repeatedly destroyed, and it ended in October 1929. Since then, France has returned to the situation of government and public strife.  Since the stabilization of the franc in 1928, French industry has gradually prospered, and the people have become richer day by day. Recently, it has been called a country of wealth, almost on par with the United States, which has the gold standard. However, the reparations issue and the war debt issue have not yet been effectively resolved. This is France's most worrying thing. Since the beginning of the world economic panic in 1930, the German economy has become more and more chaotic. The issue of reparations and war debts has become more thorny, and France's momentary prosperity is also in jeopardy. Since then, the various achievements of the right-wing parties led by Tardieu have gradually become illusory. Moreover, the national treasury is empty, the finances are stretched, and the previously promised tax cuts have become empty checks. The increase in extra expenses has exceeded the budget. The hasty agricultural policy is about to provoke resistance from the cities against the countryside, and the aggressive tariff policy will further increase the burden on consumers. All these factors are enough to cause political unrest in France. As for its international policy, in the past year, it has also held the ambition of being the leader of Europe, so that the international environment cannot be as smooth as before. The increasingly dim issue of disarmament, the temporary breakdown of the Danube economic issue, and the unresolved issue of reparations and war debts all show the difficulty of France's international policy in the future. Due to the political unrest at home and abroad, the credit of the right-wing has declined day by day, and the left-leaning forces have been able to take the opportunity to rise.  France is a parliamentary democracy, so the change of head of state and the obscurity of politics have little relationship. However, the parliament is formed by many parties. There are many political groups, and there is little concentrated and strong force. The rise and fall of cabinets and the instability of politics are the root causes of the instability of representative politics. Since 1928, the cabinet has changed more than ten times. All previous cabinets have never had an independent organization. They are all temporary combinations based on momentary harmony. Now that the right-wing forces led by Tardieu have been hit by this election, there is no hope of clinging to power. After the new president takes office, Tardieu will inevitably resign. It is expected that Herriot will make a comeback. However, the Radical Socialist Party and the Pure Socialist Party led by Herriot also have different strategies in their actions. The Socialist Party has always been known for its uncompromising attitude and holds the principle of "no cabinet formation without an absolute majority." It seems to want to rise from among the small parties and become a large party with a clear political platform. Therefore, it is still difficult to say whether it is willing to abandon its principles and form a cabinet with the Radical Socialist Party. Then, it is possible that Herriot will turn his attention to the middle parties and join hands with Tardieu to form a mixed government that is neither left nor right.  In short, there are many reasons for the slow progress of French politics, and it is difficult to end it with this election. The most important thing is that if the problem of many small parties is not eliminated, the central force will not be born. If the central force is not born, the situation of political balance will never be achieved, and the crisis of representative politics will expand. This conclusion is what French political experience has given us.</p>
<h3>The Magistrate of Baoshan County Received Luodian Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Joint Committee Inspects the Received Area The Railway and Postal Bureaus Carry Out Restoration Matters The Japanese army's first step in the withdrawal was that the three locations of Nanxiang, Liuhe, and Jiading were completely evacuated before 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. The Luodian garrison, which was scheduled to be the last to withdraw yesterday, also withdrew as agreed before 12:30 PM yesterday. Therefore, at 1:00 PM yesterday, there were no Japanese troops west of the line extending from Shizilin, Yangxing, Dachang, and Zhenru. The first step in the takeover work by our takeover committee has been completed. At the same time, the railway and postal bureaus started rushing to repair the tracks yesterday morning, and decided to send personnel to rush to repair the Qingyanggang Bridge today, in order to restore traffic as soon as possible. The details of each situation are recorded as follows: The initial takeover work has been completed.</p>
<h3>The Process of Taking Over Jiading A Visit to Jiading on the 9th</h3>
<p>A letter states that after hearing that the majority of Japanese troops had withdrawn from Jiading and Nanxiang, Pan Zhongjia, the Jiading County Magistrate, Shen Jinghua, the Director of Public Security, and other members of the war zone takeover committee, rushed to Qingpu from Shanghai on the 8th with an introductory letter from the Japanese headquarters. Pan led a Jiading police team and more than 50 public security police officers, and took a boat overnight to Anting to prepare for the takeover of Jiading. On the morning of the 9th, 500 provincial police officers sent by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, led by Inspector Xu, also drove from Kunshan to Anting to listen to Pan's command. Pan ordered 200 to go to Nanxiang, and 300 to stay in An to await dispatch. At 9:00 AM, Pan left for Waigang. It was reported that the Japanese troops who had withdrawn from Loudong in the city were causing a lot of harassment. Residents were warning each other not to enter the city. On the 8th, a certain commander of the Japanese 14th Detachment came to Jiading and imposed a special curfew for three hours from 11:00 AM. Not only were the city gates tightly closed, but all households, shops, and local maintenance associations were not allowed to open their doors. Sentries were placed at all alley entrances. At 2:00 PM, the commander of the 14th Detachment returned to Shanghai, and about 300 Japanese troops were withdrawn. This morning (the 9th), the city gates were closed again at 8:00 AM. They were transporting items onto trucks, seemingly preparing to withdraw completely. Pan, the takeover commissioner, immediately wrote a letter to the Japanese headquarters and ordered someone to deliver it for negotiation. Later, it was reported that the letter could not be delivered because the city gates were closed. At 1:00 PM, all the more than 200 Japanese troops and equipment were loaded onto 26 trucks and drove towards Shanghai on the Jiabao County Road outside the East Gate. At that time, the plainclothes police in the city, seeing that all the Japanese troops had withdrawn, feared that bandits would take the opportunity to cause trouble, so they closed the city gates and reported to Pan, the takeover commissioner, in Waigang. Pan, upon receiving the report, immediately led the police to set off and entered the city at 2:00 PM. The Japanese troops stationed at the county government office had already left on the 6th. The second gate was sealed by the maintenance association. Pan unsealed it and entered the office, immediately issuing a notice to reassure the people, and dispatched police to station in the streets. Refugees returning to the county from Shanghai entered the city one after another. Residents tore down the anti-propaganda slogans and Rising Sun flags posted by the Japanese troops on the walls. The heads of the education bureau, public security bureau, and district offices, as well as their staff, also returned to the city with County Magistrate Pan. The area suddenly became peaceful. As for Nanxiang, Takeover Commissioner Shen led the police from Qingpu. After negotiating with the Japanese military leader at the Nanxiang Chamber of Commerce, the Japanese troops immediately withdrew and retreated to Shanghai. In the afternoon, the provincial police arrived from Anting, and order gradually returned. Takeover Commissioner Pan ordered the 300 provincial police temporarily stationed in Anting to drive to the city that night and station at Qiliang School, deciding to leave half in Jiading and distribute them to various townships and towns. Tomorrow, the Magistrate of Baoshan County will come to Jiading from Qingpu and lead them to Luodian to take over.  ▲Report on the Takeover of Luodian The Japanese troops in Luodian withdrew yesterday. The takeover committee received a report from Sun Xiweng, the Magistrate of Baoshan County and takeover commissioner, the day before yesterday, which stated, "At 11:00 AM on the 9th, I departed from Shanghai with interpreter Huo Shi and went to Luodian. After arriving in the town, I negotiated with the commander of the Japanese garrison team there, Zuopan, about the handover matters. The Japanese army agreed to withdraw to Liuhang at 12:00 PM tomorrow (the 10th) and transfer to Yangxing for temporary stationing. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, I went to Jiading for inspection. The Japanese troops there had completely withdrawn at 2:00 PM that day." However, according to the municipal government's news yesterday, the Japanese troops in Luodian withdrew quite early yesterday, and completely withdrew before 12:30 PM at noon. Before 1:00 PM in the afternoon, our takeover commissioners had taken over the situation.  ▲Joint Committee Inspection In order to conduct an on-site inspection of the Japanese army's withdrawal, the joint committee organized by the Chinese and Japanese sides and neutral countries specially convened military attaches from various countries at the American consulate at 9:30 AM yesterday. The committee members from our side included Wen Yingxing, from the Japanese side Harada Yūkichi, from the UK Sanghayar, from the US Dreda, from Italy Fatini, and from France Bonner Vitai, accompanied by the committee secretary Ai Lang, set off for the front line at 9:45 AM and returned to Shanghai at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. According to a report from our committee member Wen, he accompanied military attaches from various countries to Luodian this morning for inspection. The Japanese troops there withdrew at 12:30 PM in the afternoon, and our police arrived at 1:00 PM to take over. The local situation was quite bleak.  ▲Li Mingyang's Inspection Mr. Li Mingyang, Director of the Security Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, who is assisting in the takeover matters of the provincial area this time, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday morning at 5:10 AM, Mr. Li departed from Shanghai by car to personally inspect the takeover situation. He arrived in Zhenru at around 6:00 AM. However, due to the muddy roads, he was unable to drive to Nanxiang and instead went to Jiading, arriving in Jiading at 7:20 AM. He then went to Liuhe for inspection at 10:00 AM and returned to Shanghai at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. In addition, Zhu Xibai, a member of the takeover committee, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and reported to the meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday.  ▲Report on the Takeover of Nanxiang The Japanese troops in Nanxiang withdrew the day before yesterday. However, the takeover committee did not receive a report from Shen Ziyun, the takeover commissioner there, until 10:00 AM yesterday, stating that he took over Nanxiang on the afternoon of the 9th. Fearing misunderstandings with the Japanese side, he first left the police team at Jiwang Temple and went alone to negotiate with the Japanese military police commander, Gongcun, before taking over. He also stated that Pan Zhongjia, the magistrate of Jiading County, had arrived in the county the day before yesterday to take office.  ▲Investigation of Police Force at the Front Line Because the Pingshi police were unable to arrive as scheduled in the first takeover area, 300 security team members were specially sent from Nanjing, and 500 security team members were also sent from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to the front line to handle the takeover matters. It is now known that the first batch of 500 police officers from Beiping, led by Team Leader Lu, arrived in Pukou last night and are expected to arrive at the front line this morning. It is estimated that there are currently 1,300 police officers in the front line.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Carefully Plans for Post-War Relief in the War Zone</h3>
<p>▲Meeting to Plan for Post-War Relief in the War Zone Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement in this city, all the areas where the Japanese army has withdrawn, such as Zhabei, Jiangwan, Yinxiang, the city center, and Wusong, have been taken over in order. However, the organization work after the takeover is extremely heavy. It is now known that the municipal government has ordered various bureaus to actively prepare. It is heard that the first step of the work in terms of public works is roughly divided into the following three items: (1) Clearing broken bricks and tiles from the roads, dismantling defenses, and filling trenches; (2) Repairing ditches and bridges; (3) Demolishing dangerous walls and broken houses. The above tasks must be carried out immediately after the takeover, so that traffic can be restored as soon as possible.  ▲First Restore Police Power in Zhabei Zhabei can be taken over in the next few days. The municipal government has already decided on the measures to be taken after the takeover. The first step is to restore police power. All the four districts and various branch offices and police stations of the Public Security Bureau are planned to remain in their original system without any changes. Those whose bureau sites are intact will remain at their original sites. Those that have been destroyed will rent houses near the original sites for office work. The positions will also be handled according to the previous methods. However, in addition to each station police officer, two security team members will be added, and more patrol shifts will be added to patrol within the boundary. However, because most of the houses in Zhabei have been destroyed, the organization work is planned to start with compiling temporary house numbers and investigating household registration and arresting bandits. Once the takeover is completed, it will begin to proceed.  ▲Winter Tax Issue in the War Zone The municipal authorities postponed the winter tax of the 20th year again and again out of consideration for the people due to the outbreak of the war. Now that the agreement has been signed and the Japanese army is gradually withdrawing, Jin Liren, Director of the Municipal Land Bureau, specially published a notice yesterday, stating that in the case of the announcement of the 20th year of the Bureau's winter tax, reed tax, Jinshan gang transport, and garrison rent, etc., when the collection period expired on February 15 this year, it coincided with the outbreak of the war, and the roads were blocked, so the payment was not enthusiastic. In order to take care of the people, the Bureau repeatedly requested an extension until May 15. Now that the war has stopped and the original state is gradually restored, the extension period has expired again. This winter tax and grain silver needs to be collected and solved urgently. All the people are hereby notified that all the outstanding grain taxes of the 20th year in this city should be paid to the treasury within the time limit. Overdue payments will be subject to late fees and will not be extended again. The old debts of previous years should also be cleared up quickly. Do not wait and see. This notice is very important. Jin Liren, Director of the Bureau, May 9, 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers in the War Zone Will Return to the Bureau Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>The post offices in Nanxiang, Jiading, Luodian, etc. were occupied by the Japanese army after our army retreated to the second line of defense in early March of the lunar calendar. As a result, traffic was cut off and order was disrupted. The postal workers of each bureau were unable to exercise their powers. They were immediately ordered to relocate to Shanghai to work, and a temporary office was temporarily set up on the third floor of the Postal Headquarters on North Sichuan Road to deliver ordinary mail within the possible scope. According to reliable information, the Shanghai Postal Administration, in view of the fact that the Japanese army on the front line has gradually withdrawn, restoring the post offices in the war zone is the top priority. Therefore, yesterday morning, it ordered Shu Wending, the director of the Nanxiang Bureau, Duan Changgen, the director of the Jiading Bureau, and Kan Junheng, the director of the Luodian Bureau, who were in Shanghai, to quickly pack their bags and return to their original bureaus to prepare for the restoration of work. It is also heard that after receiving the order, the directors of each bureau have decided to gather at the Postal Headquarters at 8:00 AM tomorrow (the 12th) with their families and employees, hire a car to transport the personnel to Zhongshan Bridge on Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai, transfer to a small car, and go to their original bureaus to serve. If all the roads along the way are unimpeded, then from the 13th, the above bureaus will be able to resume postal services.</p>
<h3>The Railway Bureau is Preparing to Repair Bridge Work</h3>
<p>After the Japanese army began to withdraw, in order to restore traffic, the Railway Bureau has been summoning Chen Xinghan, the director of the bureau, Zheng Baozhao, the director of the Transportation Department, and important personnel from various departments and sections for days to discuss and prepare for traffic. Now the preparations have been completed in order, and the repair work has begun. If there are no obstacles, the passenger cars can be fully restored around the 20th of this month. The recent situation of the road is recorded below.  ▲Two Stations Were Burned and Looted The Huangdu Station was suddenly burned down the day before yesterday. All the items in the station were burned. The cause of the burning is still unknown. Also, the Nanxiang Station was looted by traitors after the Japanese army withdrew the day before yesterday. Most of the items at the station were lost. Even the electrical road signs and various machines used by the station were dismantled. Now that traffic is imminent, they must be replaced before they can be used. (East China News Agency)  ▲Ministry of Railways Sends Personnel to Negotiate Nanjing, 10th Telegram, The Ministry of Railways sent Yang Xianfen and Chen Guan to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to meet with the Transportation Department of the Railway Bureau to negotiate and prepare for traffic. Now Yang and Chen have gone to the area east of Suzhou to inspect everything. According to the Ministry of Railways, traffic between Nanjing and Shanghai is expected to be realized in about ten days.  ▲Rescue Train Departs for the Front Line The Japanese army began to withdraw. According to the plan, the Railway Bureau sent Chen Yin, an engineer from the Shanghai-Zhenjiang Section, and Zhang, Su, and Kun, engineers from the Kunshan Section, to lead more than 70 road repair workers, riding on a rescue train, with one flower car and all the rescue cars, equipped with application tools and a large amount of materials, departed from Zhenjiang on the morning of the 8th, passed through Su that evening, and drove directly to Kunshan.</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>▲Start Repairing Bridge Work After the rescue train arrived in Kunshan on the evening of the 8th, the Railway Bureau sent personnel to negotiate with the headquarters of the 19th Route Army, and it was agreed to start repairing the bridge on the 11th. However, the authorities of the 19th Route Army, seeing that the obstacles at both ends of the Qingyanggang Bridge have now been removed, specially asked the engineers of the Railway Bureau to rush to repair it. Now the engineers have driven the rescue train near the Qingyanggang Bridge to stop, so as to carry out the repair work.  ▲Test Run Next Monday The road has been actively rushed to repair and is expected to be fully restored within a week. After the section from Kunshan to Shanghai is repaired, a test run will be carried out first. However, all the locomotives and vehicles of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway are west of Kunshan. When the test run is carried out in the future, it is planned to borrow vehicles from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. It is expected to be implemented next Monday. At that time, Mr. Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Transportation Department, will personally take the vehicle to inspect the damaged situation along the way.  ▲Inspect North Station Yesterday Mr. Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Transportation Department, and Ma Zhishan, an electrical inspector, took a car to Jielu at around 4:00 PM yesterday, got off the car, crossed the barbed wire and went to the original site of the North Station to inspect, and went to the original ticket office of the Songhu Railway Station and the bungalows on the east side to check this house for a week, and decided to use this house as the temporary office location of the Transportation Department. At that time, there were four third-class cars and five fourth-class cars on the third Nanjing-Shanghai Railway track. At the front of the inspection, there were two Japanese naval soldiers in blue military uniforms, standing with guns, but did not stop or check. The barbed wire at the intersection of North Henan Road, Jielu, and Baoshan Road was incomplete. There were several Chinese police and one Western police officer at Jielu. At 5:00 PM, Mr. Zheng and others crossed the barbed wire and returned to Jielu. According to Mr. Zheng, all the personnel of the Transportation Department are now ready. Once the Machinery and Engineering Departments notify that the damaged areas have been repaired, they can immediately go to the original stations to work.  ▲Shanghai West Road Track Repaired Luo Shenghao, Director of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Engineering Office, sent many workers to repair the branch track of the Xinlonghua East Outer Yangqi Tongbei Station and the steel rail of the Nianwu Bridge between Xujiahui and Fanwangdu at 7:00 AM yesterday, and completed it at 6:00 PM that evening. Traffic has been restored.  ▲Shanghai-Hangzhou Express Restored Since the outbreak of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road War, all special express trains going up and down have been suspended. Although there are now three round trips between Shanghai and Hangzhou, and one between Shanghai, He, and Hangzhou, there are still not enough seats due to the large number of passengers. In view of this, the Transportation Department specially planned to restore the original express trains on the road at the same time when the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway was restored. It is roughly ready now, but due to insufficient vehicles, it is being allocated. It is scheduled to be implemented next Tuesday. The current departure times of each train will also be slightly changed. Copy of the Ceasefire Agreement</p>
<h3>The Signature Date is Still Uncertain</h3>
<p>▲The Japanese Side Claims That There Are Problems With Both the Chinese and Japanese Translations The Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement was not signed yesterday because the two sides had not contacted each other. The two sides are still requesting instructions on the disputed wording. According to Okazaki, the secretary in charge of this matter on the Japanese side, the remaining wording in the agreement is not only on the Chinese side, but both sides have problems. The two sides are still exchanging views. If this problem can be resolved tomorrow (i.e., today), then it can be signed on Thursday. However, it cannot be determined whether it can be signed on Thursday. He hopes to sign it on that day. Okazaki also repeatedly stated that the word "Hostilities" has been resolved, but he refused to clearly state the disputed wording, only saying that this word is very important. Wang Jingwei</p>
<h3>Telegrammed the Content of the Agreement</h3>
<p>▲Reply to Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Jiadian  ▲Saying There Are No Other Secret Documents Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Telegram, Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, telegraphed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on the 10th, "The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has been notified. The Shanghai ceasefire and troop withdrawal agreement, in addition to the five publicly announced articles and three annexes, and the Chinese government's automatic declaration on the takeover of the special police force, has no other secret documents or accepts any secret conditions. The government's handling of diplomacy has always been open. Please do not worry." Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan, steamed, National Salvation Association</p>
<h3>Letter to Guo Taiqi</h3>
<p>▲Inconsistent Words and Deeds  ▲Actually Signed Humiliating National Articles The Shanghai Federation of National Salvation Groups sent a letter to Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi yesterday, stating, "Dear Sir, our association has sternly rejected the unreasonable demands of the Japanese representative (no troops stationed in Pudong South City) at the Shanghai ceasefire conference, and has made a responsible statement to the people (the head can be broken, but humiliating national articles cannot be accepted). Therefore, we express our deep trust, hoping that you will be able to fulfill your previous words and negotiate. We do not dare to have any personal intentions. Now, after reading the full text of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement, which has been announced, we acknowledge that the Japanese troops who fought can permanently reside in the public concessions and road construction beyond the borders. Their withdrawal from the front line to designated locations such as Wusong and Jiangwan, and then to the concessions, is not stipulated to be time-limited. Our troops are limited to temporarily stationed at the original defense. All the areas where the Japanese army withdrew, Jiading, Baoshan, and the territory of Shanghai, with an area of more than 3,000 square miles, will not allow our army to enter one step until the scope involved in the agreement has returned to normal and the measures have been decided. The administrative status of the withdrawal area, such as the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh District Public Security Bureaus, and the original police and administrative personnel, cannot restore their old appearance. The so-called special police take over, and the special police use so-called foreign experts as officials and instructors. Our army is also not allowed to enter Pudong South City. The names of (unarmed zone) and (free city) required by Japan have been embodied in the agreement, which is obviously destroying territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity. Our association's previous trust was indeed deceived. In addition to issuing declarations and publishing notices to declare denial of the agreement that destroys territorial sovereignty, we hereby inform you. I hope you will check it out. Yours sincerely, Vice Minister Guo."</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Visits Sun Ke</h3>
<p>▲ Relaying the intentions of Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek ▲ Hoping to meet and discuss matters soon ▲ Talk of a Hangzhou meeting is now in the past</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu, former Minister of Transportation, recently came to Shanghai under orders from the Central Government to visit Sun Ke and convey the intentions of Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek.  An initial meeting was scheduled for 5 PM the day before yesterday, but it did not occur. Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, Chen, accompanied by Huang Jusu, former magistrate of Zhongshan County, visited Sun at Molier Road.  The discussion lasted for an hour and a half before Chen took his leave. According to investigations by this newspaper's reporter, the content of yesterday's Sun-Chen meeting began with Chen Mingshu relating the circumstances of the Central Government's order for him to come to Shanghai, and the opinions of Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek regarding the program for resisting Japan and saving the nation proposed by Sun Ke.  This was followed by a brief discussion of the Guangdong issue. Finally, Chen requested that Sun choose a date to meet with Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek in person to discuss everything. Sun also expressed his extreme sincerity. The outcome of the meeting was quite positive.  It is said that Sun and Chen need to meet several more times in Shanghai before a final decision can be reached.  Then Chen will return to Nanjing to report, determining the location and date of the Wang-Chiang-Sun meeting. As for the talk of a Hangzhou meeting, this matter occurred in mid-May. At that time, Wang Jingwei in Nanjing telegraphed Sun proposing it, but it is now a thing of the past. Where the meeting will be held in the future, whether in Shanghai, Nanjing, or another location, is still undecided.  Furthermore, rumors that Chen is about to go to Guangdong as a mediator have already been denied by Chen.</p>

<h3>Explaining Reasons for Resignation</h3>
<p>▲ Reply to telegram from Shanghai patriotic groups</p>
<p>The local maintenance committee and the national salvation association of this city and other groups received a reply telegram yesterday from Commander Jiang Guangnai and General Cai Tingkai of the 19th Route Army, which stated:</p>
<p>"To the local maintenance committee and national salvation association, greetings.  We received and understood your telegram.  According to the organization of the National Army, the师(shi) (division) is the unit.  The titles of Commander and General are temporary military posts established for combat.  Therefore, when our army was transferred from Jiangxi to the Shanghai-Nanjing area last winter, we requested the government to relieve us of our military posts, but this was not permitted.  In our hesitation, the bandits became an immediate threat.  As the difficulties in Shanghai arose, Guangnai and others did not hesitate to endure our illness and fatigue, and reluctantly took the lead, compelled by our conscience and eager to die for the cause.  However, our energy was insufficient, and we have accumulated many faults.  Since retreating, although the government has been tolerant and has not imposed punishment, and the people have been understanding and have offered encouragement, we cannot help but feel ashamed when we ask ourselves in the middle of the night.  Now that the war has come to an end, and the government has a well-thought-out strategy for dealing with the aftermath, these temporary military posts should naturally be relinquished.  What we hope for is to be in line with the organization of the National Army, which is precisely our private desire to reduce our faults.  If there is anything we can do to defend the nation from disaster, we will not hesitate to exert ourselves at any time.  We are honored to receive your inquiry and respectfully express our feelings.  We hope you will understand.</p>
<p>Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai bow respectfully, Yu"</p>

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council</h3>
<h3>Accepts Preliminary Report</h3>
<p>To be left for discussion at the League of Nations General Assembly</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations Council accepted the preliminary report of the Liaoning Incident investigation team. The Council convened at 10:40 AM, chaired by Ambassador Matos of Guatemala. The agenda included eleven items. After resolving several trivial matters, Matos introduced the preliminary report of the investigation team, saying that he believed the council members were prepared to accept the report without much discussion. The Japanese representative then rose and said that Japan agreed with the chairman's proposal but did not abandon the reservations previously stated. The Chinese representative, Hu Shize, also stated that the Chinese government accepted the report without much comment. The case was thus passed. However, after the meeting, Matos told a reporter from the American News Agency that the Council's acceptance of the report without discussion should not be seen as the League of Nations General Assembly accepting the report without further debate. Because after the Council's acceptance, the report would be automatically transferred to the League of Nations General Assembly. At today's Council meeting, there were also five proposals concerning the Free City of Danzig, which were all discussed and concluded in a short time. The meeting was adjourned at 12:20 PM (10th Kuomintang News Agency dispatch).</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council met today, chaired by Matos. Mr. Matos stated that he had received the preliminary report from the Lytton Investigation Team, and added that the investigation team was only reporting facts for now. Therefore, the Administrative Council did not want to discuss it, as it had been decided to submit the matter to the League of Nations General Assembly meeting in September. The Japanese representative, Mr. Nagaoka, accepted Mr. Matos's statement, but maintained Japan's position on Manchuria. The Chinese representative, Mr. Hu, also accepted it without any reservations (10th Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Decides on Fundamental Countermeasures Toward the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The interim report of the League of Nations investigation team will be submitted to the League of Nations Council today. If the Council forwards it to the League of Nations General Assembly, turning the Manchurian issue over to the League of Nations General Assembly for resolution, then a direct confrontation between the Japanese government and the League of Nations will be difficult to avoid. Therefore, the Japanese government attaches great importance to this matter. It is reported that the Japanese government's policy is as follows: (1) The international investigation team was formed based on a resolution of the Council, so its report should also be reviewed by the Council. (2) The Japanese government absolutely opposes the League of Nations General Assembly applying Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant to review the Manchurian issue, regardless of the circumstances. This is a fundamental policy that has already been decided. The Japanese representative in Geneva has been instructed that even if the Council only submits this report to the League of Nations General Assembly as a reference material, he should avoid a proactive attitude during the review. In short, depending on the Council's attitude, the problem could become more serious (10th Domei News Agency dispatch).</p>

Wu first sent Li Xianken back to Guangdong with a personal letter, which was reported at the memorial week on the 9th.

<h3>Xiao Focheng and Others Issue a Circular Telegram</h3>
<h3>Opposing the Ceasefire Agreement</h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu and Jiang Guangnai telegraph Guangdong to explain</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangdong Central Committee members Xiao Focheng, Tang Shaoyi, Deng Zeru, Zou Lu, Chen Jiantang, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Yu Hanmou, Xiang Hanping, and Li Yangjing issued a circular telegram on the 9th opposing the ceasefire agreement, saying, "We respectfully received two telegrams. The Central Government believes that the Shanghai Incident should be resolved at the same time as the Dongbei (Manchuria) Incident. However, this ceasefire conference only addressed the Shanghai Incident, ignoring the Dongbei issue, which is a great miscalculation. Regarding the agreement, if Japan uses the excuse that normalcy has not been restored to resume hostilities, then we will never have the freedom to station troops in the area listed in the first annex. Article 4 stipulates the withdrawal of both sides, treating the aggressor and the victim of aggression as equals. Moreover, why should our army withdraw within our own territory? The same article stipulates that Japanese troops will withdraw and be replaced by Chinese police. The statement attached by our country further states that a special police force will be formed to maintain order, meaning that we can only defend the area with police, but without the right to station troops, which is no different from the stipulation that no troops can be stationed near Tianjin in the Boxer Protocol. The government has consistently refused to allow the people to inquire about this treaty, and the Shanghai organizations have repeatedly called for its declaration, but it has been kept secret. The legislative body has also refused to allow time for consideration. If it were not a matter of losing rights and humiliating the country, why would there be absolute secrecy and a hasty signing? In the past, Yuan Shikai signed the Twenty-One Demands, which the people still hate today. How can our revolutionary government follow in his footsteps?" (10th dispatch).</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Political Council received a telegram from Li Bai on the 7th, saying that the signing of the traitorous agreement has deeply angered all citizens, and that if the rumors are true, they should be attacked immediately (10th dispatch).</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Mingshu and Jiang Guangnai telegraphed the Guangdong Central Committee and Chen Jiantang, Zhang Huichang, Chen Ce, etc., saying that the ceasefire agreement does indeed contain unspeakable humiliations, but after observing the situation at home and abroad and weighing the relative importance, it is still better than the alternative. If this can inspire the conscience of the authorities across the country, invigorate the dying people, and resolutely resist aggression, protect the integrity of our mountains and rivers, and maintain the survival of our nation, exhausting our efforts to plan for livelihoods and education, then things can still be done, and the price of this loss and humiliation can eventually be recovered. Now that the foreign threat has not been quelled, a dispute has arisen in Guangdong over the reorganization of the naval and air forces, with each side going to extremes and trying to outdo the other within their own spheres of influence. Continuing this stalemate will not benefit the country. Internal strife, even if taking a step forward is not honorable enough, and taking a step back is not humiliating enough, you are all members of the Central Committee, and you have talents that can be used. I hope you will abandon your prejudices and not engage in a tit-for-tat struggle, but work together to devise a national strategy. Otherwise, internal strife will be endless, and foreign troubles will not be resolved. The national humiliation memorial days on the calendar will increase year by year (10th dispatch).</p>

<h3>Lebrun Elected as New French President</h3>
<p>Doumer's Automatic Withdrawal from the Election; Voting Held in the Palace of Versailles ▲ Guomin News Agency, Versailles, 10th. Members of the French Senate and former members of the House of Representatives met at the Palace of Versailles this afternoon at 2 PM to elect a new president, still chaired by Lebrun. As a result of the votes in both houses of the Senate, Lebrun was elected President of France. After the announcement, Lebrun immediately drove back to Paris to take office. ▲ Havas, Paris, 10th. After President Doumer was assassinated, the hastily convened joint conference of the Senate and the House of Representatives held the presidential election in the old Palace of Versailles today. The results are as follows: Albert Lebrun received 639 votes, Paul Faure received 114 votes, and Cachin received 9 votes. The presidential election conference has a total of 932 eligible voters. Therefore, Lebrun has obtained an absolute majority and was elected as the new president. ▲ Lebrun's Brief Biography Lebrun's name is Albert, born on August 29, 1871, in the town of Meuse and Moselle in the province of Eus-et-Moselle. He is 61 years old. His father was a farmer, and his family was poor. However, Lebrun was an exceptionally intelligent child. In 1892, he graduated from the École Polytechnique, ranking first. Three years later, he graduated from the École des Mines, and then engaged in mining metallurgy. However, he soon entered politics. In 1900, he first entered the House of Representatives, and then served as secretary of the House of Representatives for two years in 1906 and 1907. In 1915, he was elected Vice-President of the House. In 1902, he changed to the Senate and immediately became a strong member of the House. He has served on the Colonial Committee and the Military Committee successively, and served as Vice-Chairman of the Colonial Committee. In 1921, he served as the French member of the International League of Nations Armaments Mixed Committee. Two years later, he represented France to attend the committee, which was the beginning of Lebrun's international political prominence. Later, he was elected Chairman of the Senate. In his life, he has written extensively on industry, mining and metallurgy, and politics. In 1912, he joined the Poincaré cabinet. In 1913 and 1916, he joined the Doumergue cabinet successively. In 1917 and 1919, he joined the Clemenceau cabinet twice, but only for a short time. His political views belong to the Republican Union in the Senate. ▲ Reuters, Paris, 10th. This afternoon, the parliament met at the Palace of Versailles to elect a successor to the presidency. If there are no unexpected changes, Senate President Lebrun can be assured of being elected. Although Doumer has withdrawn from the election, there may still be two others joining the candidates, one is Socialist Party Secretary-General Faure, and the other is Communist Party veteran Cachin. Both of them failed in the first round of voting in the general election on May 1. However, the participation of the two is only to stir up attention and is not necessarily intended to win this seat. Parliament will meet at 2:00 PM this afternoon, chaired by Lebrun. The voting may be completed at about 5:00 PM. The results will likely be announced by the Vice-President of the Senate. As usual, the new president will drive from the Palace of Versailles to the Presidential Palace. Now, during the national mourning period, he will drive back to his private residence. ▲ Reuters, Paris, 9th. Former French Prime Minister Doumer has been listed as a presidential candidate, but has now withdrawn to show that he is not competing with Senate President Lebrun for this seat. The Radical Party, the largest party in the Senate, has expressed to Doumer and Lebrun that they should not compete. Doumer saw that the Radicals favored Lebrun, so he automatically withdrew his name. ▲ Havas, Paris, 9th. The presidential election conference convened tomorrow at the Palace of Versailles includes members of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives is still the one elected in 1928 because its term of office will only expire on May 31. The presidential election conference should have had 899 members, but some former members of the House of Representatives failed to be re-elected this time or did not attend. During the presidential election, candidates must obtain an absolute majority to be elected, even in the second round of voting. The so-called absolute majority is 450 votes. According to the current constitution, the presidential powers are temporarily exercised by the Council of State. Therefore, after the new president is elected, Premier Tardieu will transfer his powers in the Palace of Versailles, and the Minister of Personnel will immediately send the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor to the new president to wear. The presidential election conference is chaired by the President of the Senate according to law. However, the current President of the Senate, Lebrun, is also a presidential candidate. Therefore, he will only supervise the election as usual. The reading of the voting results will be conducted by the First Vice-President of the Senate.</p>
<h3>▲ New Divisions of Various Parties in the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Paris, 9th.

<h3>▲ Herriot Goes to Paris to Discuss Forming a Cabinet</h3>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Lyon, 9th. Herriot set off for Paris today to attend the National Assembly convened in the Palace of Versailles tomorrow and to discuss the formation of a new cabinet. Herriot has been stranded in Lyon due to a major landslide disaster outside Lyon. He was finally able to go to the capital. The number of people who died in the disaster here is now believed to be around 60. Therefore, Herriot frequently told people before he left that although the Radical Socialist Party won a great victory after the President was assassinated, Lyon suffered this major disaster, making him sad and unhappy. ▲ Guomin News Agency, Paris, 10th. According to reliable sources, although Tardieu will submit the cabinet's resignation to the new president tonight, he is still willing to stay in office until June, after the new parliament has convened its inaugural meeting, and then resign. However, during this period, he will only handle daily affairs and is unwilling to assume new responsibilities of a political nature. Therefore, the Echo de Paris speculates that Tardieu may not go to Geneva again in the future to continue the talks of the five major powers.</p>
<h3>Doumer's Remains to be Buried Tomorrow</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 9th. President Doumer's remains will be buried at the Panthéon, but the burial site will be in the Doumer family's private cemetery at the request of Mrs. Doumer.

<h3>The Assassin of Doumer</h3>
<p>French Authorities Point to Him as a Red Party Member; Soviet Russia Lodges a Serious Protest ▲ Guomin News Agency, Moscow, 9th. The Soviet Russian government has instructed its ambassador to France to protest seriously to the French Foreign Office against Tardieu's claim that the assassin of the French President, Gogulov, was a member of the Communist Party's terrorist group. There is great indignation here at the French Prime Minister's remarks, claiming that Tardieu's kind of argument will affect French-Russian relations.</p>
<h3>Upholding Parliamentary Politics</h3>
<p>Rejection of Nationalism ▲ Electric Communication, Tokyo, 10th. The Minseito Party held a general affairs meeting at its headquarters this afternoon to discuss parliamentary strategies and plans to issue a statement asserting that the ills of party politics should be rectified by the parties themselves.

<h3>Investigation Team Coming North</h3>
<h3>Patriotic Volunteers Rise Up</h3>
<p>▲ Commander Gong Changhai's Brigade Recovers Fenzheng and Binxian Counties ▲ Feng Zhanhai Blocks Japanese Troops at Nantianmen ▲ Japanese Troops on the Harbin-Suifenhe Line Intercepted into Several Sections Harbin Correspondence: Since the advance of Cai Hongyou's Brigade of Ma Zhanshan's forces to the Hu-Hai railway line, patriotic volunteer armies and national salvation armies in northern Manchuria have gathered in Harbin from all directions, united by their determination to save the country. With the arrival of the League of Nations investigation team in northern Manchuria imminent, these armies have coordinated their efforts to recover Harbin. Ma Zhanshan also intends to board the train carrying Lord Lytton and others at a suitable location on the Harbin-Changchun line to meet with them. All of this is intended to express the genuine patriotism of our military and civilians to the international community. Fearing the exposure of their deceitful schemes, the Japanese have deployed heavy forces in various key locations to prevent this. The following is a summary of the recent activities of the various volunteer armies: ▲ Black Army Concentrates on the Hu-Hai Line Cai Hongyou's Black Army brigade has concentrated its forces at Xujia Station on the Hu-Hai Line for the past two days. In the Suihua and Sifangtai areas, newly formed local militias serve as reserves. The Harbin-Hailun railway bridge over the Hulan River was blown up on the morning of the 3rd, completely cutting off traffic between Songpǔ City and Hulan. Yesterday, two Japanese military trains carrying 500 soldiers and countless supplies arrived from Wujimi on the eastern line and transferred to Songpǔ Station on the Hu-Hai Line. As a result, approximately 2,000 Japanese soldiers are now concentrated in that area, digging two trenches more than ten li long, adopting a purely defensive posture. According to an announcement by the Japanese military headquarters, they plan to dispatch the newly formed troops of the Eighth Division by the end of this month or the middle of next month, using a division's strength to attack along the Hu-Hai line. At the same time, the Amano Brigade stationed in Heihe will advance from the Qiqihar-Koshi line, intending to encircle the volunteers. Therefore, a major battle in eastern Heilongjiang is not imminent. Currently, the Japanese have dispatched Dou Qingshan, the Director of the General Affairs Office of the railway bureau, to act as the bureau chief. He is gathering some former employees in Songpǔ City and dispatching 20 workers from the South Manchuria Railway to repair damaged vehicles to maintain military transport. However, due to the lack of vehicles, there are rumors that they are repurposing vehicles from the Chinese Eastern Railway. For days, Japanese aircraft have been continuously scouting along the Hu-Hai line. At noon on the 3rd, a Japanese aircraft flew to Suihua and was shot at by the garrison, forcing it to turn back. ▲ Self-Defense Army Recovers Binxian County Gong Changhai's brigade of the Self-Defense Army, in coordination with the Yao Zhangsun detachments, took advantage of the weak forces of Xi Qia's troops stationed in Fangzheng County on the night of April 28th, launching a surprise attack with gagged mouths, achieving success. They seized the equipment of a regiment of Xi's troops and captured more than 500 soldiers. The remnants of Xi's forces scattered and fled. On the morning of the 29th, Gong's brigade took advantage of the victory to pursue them fiercely. At noon that day, they encountered Yu Shencheng's bandit army of 3,000 men in Tǒngzigōu, engaging in a fierce battle for three hours, defeating Yu's army and seizing four mountain and mortar guns and more than 800 rifles. Yu's army retreated towards Binxian County, and Gong's brigade pursued them relentlessly. They passed Jiabanzhan on the evening of the 30th, and on the morning of May 1st, the main force attacked Binxian County from the front, while a separate detachment threatened Xi's troops in Beiketú of Heilongshan and Húnníwā to the left of Binxian County. Xi's troops telegraphed the Japanese in Harbin for assistance while digging trenches for defense. However, many soldiers refused to fight, abandoning their weapons and fleeing, or changing their yellow armbands to red ones and defecting to the Self-Defense Army. Many were killed. Consequently, Binxian County was captured by Gong's brigade from the north and east gates on the night of the 2nd. Xi's troops retreated completely to Feiketú to await reinforcements. At 11 AM on the 3rd, the Japanese, upon hearing the news, dispatched two aircraft from the 3rd Independent Flying Squadron to scout over Binxian County. They circled over the city for a long time, dropping more than ten bombs near the east gate, destroying three shops and killing three civilians, injuring one. A large fire broke out at the time. Gong's brigade fought the fire while shooting at the aircraft, which then flew back. Currently, the Japanese, due to their dispersed forces, have no time to send troops to defend. Instead, Xi Qia's troops are deploying along the line from Feiketú and Huangshanzuizi to Harbin, attempting to prevent Gong's brigade from attacking Harbin. However, Gong's brigade is advancing rapidly and is reportedly heading towards Harbin today. ▲ Two Armies Clash at Nantianmen The Japanese army, planning to attack Yilan downstream, sent its first batch of dozens of ships, which arrived at Nantianmen, south of Fangzheng, on April 30th. The area is one of the most dangerous on the river. The Japanese troops immediately landed, simultaneously dividing their forces to occupy the counties of Tonghe and Mulan on the north bank of the river in Heilongjiang Province, stationing troops there as a remote response. However, on the morning of May 1st, Feng Zhanhai's volunteer army of 3,000 men, in coordination with a part of Li Du and Ding Chao's army, suddenly arrived from Fangzheng and opened fire on the Japanese army across the river. After three hours of fierce fighting, three Japanese troop carriers were sunk and five were damaged. Because many Japanese troops had landed, casualties were relatively low, but much of their supplies were not recovered, resulting in significant losses of military equipment. The Japanese army, unable to advance due to the obstruction, urgently dispatched a second batch of 2,000 troops for reinforcement, which arrived on the 2nd to assist in the attack, but they were still unable to advance. The two sides have now reached a stalemate. Feng Zhanhai's army, based on the Nantianmen mountain pass, controlled the waterway from a high position. The Japanese dispatched several aircraft to bomb the area for days, but due to the dense forests, they were unsuccessful. At 10 AM on the 3rd, 1,000 of Xi Qia's troops and 1,000 Japanese heavy artillery troops traveled on the third batch of river ships. That night, while passing Xindian, they were intercepted across the river by Gong Changhai's army, which had come north from Binxian County. One Japanese warship was sunk, drowning more than 200 soldiers, with the rest escaping. It is clear that the Japanese army's attempt to attack Yilan was obstructed midway and could not advance, and the ends were also lost. Their arrogance should be diminished. ▲ National Salvation Army Reaches Maoershan Since April 20th, the National Salvation Army on the Harbin-Suifenhe line has been luring the Japanese Murai Brigade away from the front of Yimianpo. Liu Wankui's force has been responsible for advancing. When the Japanese army advances, Liu's army retreats; when the Japanese army does not advance, Liu's army advances. This has been repeated several times. Until the evening of the 30th, Yimianpo was seized by Zhang Dacheng's branch of the National Salvation Army, who once attacked the eastern highlands of the railway, destroying Japanese power grids, trenches, and wooden stakes. Later, the Japanese Yoda Brigade advanced from Harbin, and the National Salvation Army retreated slightly. However, the Murai Brigade advanced to Hengdaohezi and dared not go deep, only exchanging defenses with the Yoda unit before returning to Harbin. Unexpectedly, after the troop train passed Yimianpo, the railway bridge between Xiao Jiuzhan was blown up by the National Salvation Army. At the same time, the wooden bridges and tracks at Wujimi and Xiao Jiuzhan were destroyed in six places, preventing the Japanese troop trains from returning. The Yoda Brigade advanced to Hailin Station, but the remaining railways were also destroyed, making it impossible to advance or retreat. Liu Wankui's force, in coordination with Li Xiangshan's force of about 4,000 men, gathered at Mudanjiang and returned to attack. Firing was heard on the afternoon of the 3rd. Today's eastbound passenger trains were not able to depart (eastbound trains have only been running to Maoershan for days). It is reported that the National Salvation Army cavalry has bypassed Maoershan and advanced to Ashihe, making the situation extremely serious. The Japanese army stationed in Harbin, along with several hundred of Xi Qia's troops, have all been dispatched to Ashihe to block the advance. However, it is reported that the National Salvation Army is planning to join forces with Gong Changhai's unit in Harbin. In addition to the four aforementioned army routes, Li Qingshan's National Salvation Volunteer Army has been successfully reorganized and is mostly advancing towards Taolaizhao and Sanchahe on the Harbin-Changchun line. Xi's army stationed in Sanchahe is under tight security, with reports of unrest. Another branch, under the command of Ma Zhanshan, is coordinating with the Black Army Zhu Fengyang regiment stationed in Zhaodong, the Li regiment stationed in Dalai, and the Sun regiment stationed in Andada Station to operate on the Tao'ang railway line, and to coordinate with Cheng Zhiyuan's army stationed in Heihe to recover the provincial capital. Therefore, the Japanese Suzuki Brigade stationed in Fulaerji near Harbin on the Manchurian line dispatched two contingents early on the 3rd to defend the Daxingzhen on the Tao'ang line.

<h3>Concentrated in the Pacific</h3>
<p>▲ Ready to Defend the East Coast in Case of Emergency According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, the U.S. Navy Department plans to permanently concentrate all fleets on the Pacific coast. Currently, the opinions of naval giants are unanimously in favor. Meanwhile, the 50 scout ships of the Atlantic fleet will also move to the west coast. Although this is the original naval policy of the United States, the U.S. government's assessment of the changing situation in the Far East carries deep implications. Currently, only two old battleships and eight destroyers of the training fleet and several submarines remain on the Atlantic coast. Naval authorities say they can defend the east coast in case of emergency. In addition, on the 3rd of this month, Hall, the chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, proposed that the U.S. naval power should be increased within the limits stipulated by the London Treaty. He said that naval expansionists should take advantage of the situation in the Far East to realize the naval expansion plan in one fell swoop. However, President Hoover is preventing the naval expansion movement caused by international terrorism and is advocating for reducing national expenditures. Russian representative to Geneva presents</p>
<h3>Memorandum Attacking Japan</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reports that the Russian representative recently presented a memorandum to the Disarmament Conference, the content of which criticizes Japan's actions in Manchuria. The text reads: (The Russian government recognizes the resolution of the General Commission on Disarmament of April 20, namely, that the armaments of a country, taking into account the geographical position of the country and all sorts of things, and the safety of the country, should be reduced to a minimum. However, neighboring countries that violate international obligations to maintain peace will be considered. This is because they wage war without declaring it, and transport land and sea forces to foreign territories under the pretext of protecting their residents and rights, engaging in hostile acts. Therefore, Russia proposes that the oath to reduce armaments in the aforementioned resolution should not be considered for countries without sufficient guarantees.) It also describes the crisis in Manchuria.</p>
<h3>May Ninth Memorial Meeting</h3>
<p>Luoyang News: At 9 AM on the 9th, the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held an enlarged memorial week and the May 9th National Humiliation Memorial Meeting at the Luoyang Heluo Middle School Auditorium. Lin Sen, Ju Zheng, Liu Shouchong, Zhang Ji, and officials from the Party Headquarters and the National Government, as well as representatives from various military and political institutions, schools, and civil groups in Luoyang, attended. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting and made a report after the ceremony. Lin Sen then gave a speech. ▲ Ju Zheng's Report Briefly Stated: Today in the fourth year of the Republic of China was the day Yuan Shikai secretly signed the treaty that would have led to the country's demise. Although it was denied by the entire nation, this treaty has had a lasting detrimental effect to this day. We should never forget this and vow to wash away this humiliation. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, the European War was in full swing, and Yuan Shikai was eager to become emperor. Japan saw this as an excellent opportunity to invade China and made 21 demands for the demise of the country to the Yuan government, forcing Yuan to accept them. Yuan finally succumbed, recognizing his demands on May 9th, reaching the extreme of losing power and humiliating the country. After the end of the European War, our country submitted the 21 Articles to the Washington Conference. Although some considered it invalid or abandoned, Japan still used this evil example to wantonly harass China. The balance of power among the powers in China and the open door were destroyed by it. Since then, Japan's oppression of us has continued to emerge, such as the May 30th Shanghai Massacre, the May 3rd Jinan Massacre, and the Korean incident last year, and the September 18th attack on Shenyang and the disturbance in Shanghai this spring, all of which are strange humiliations and deep hatreds for our country. Our people must work together, be of one mind and one heart, and strive for revenge and wash away this humiliation. Our party is the vanguard of the people and has a heavy responsibility. In particular, we should all be sincere, eliminate prejudices, consolidate the center, concentrate our strength, and gradually prepare for revenge. Like Goujian, King of Yue, enduring humiliation, sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, we must plan to eliminate Wu before we can stop. As for the government, it should follow our party's platform, seriously encourage self-responsibility, start anew with the people, rescue disasters and defend against diseases, so as to appease the people, increase production, rectify discipline, concentrate talents, and not make laws and orders complicated, and strive to achieve common norms, and always examine and implement them in practice, so as to give the Chinese people a common view. The Chinese nation will surely leap to a position of freedom and equality, then shame can be washed away, hatred can be avenged, and it is said that the people will gather and aim at our party and complain about the government, which we do not believe. ▲ Lin Sen's speech briefly stated: The ancients said, knowing shame is akin to courage, so we must clearly understand the two words national shame before we can have the possibility of washing it away. The May 9th National Humiliation was the greatest oppression Japan imposed on China, but we must examine ourselves, why did Japan oppress us? The reason is that Yuan Shikai betrayed the Republic of China and wanted to restore the imperial system, so he signed the 21 Articles of power and national humiliation regardless of everything, and the big mistake was made from then on. But our country has already opposed this secret treaty in its entirety, and it has been denied by the parliament that had been approved to conclude treaties with foreign countries at that time, and it has completely lost the basis of its treaty. Later, it was opposed by various countries at the Washington Conference, who considered it to violate public reason, and it is needless to say that it lost its treaty effect. However, Japan actually wants to use this to destroy our country, which is really hateful. If we commemorate the national humiliation by only holding meetings and giving speeches every year, what is the significance? From today onwards, we must be determined to wash away the humiliation. The ancients said that those who have ambition will succeed. If everyone is determined to wash away the humiliation, the national humiliation will definitely be washed away. We must unite from now on and concentrate our strength to wash away the humiliation. However, to seek great unity, we should start from self-cultivation and diligence, and the elements must be healthy to be united, so that they can be firm, and then we can unite the forces to deal with the outside world. I hope everyone will be inspired, encourage each other, and implement them in practice, so that we can achieve the day of revenge and washing away the humiliation.</p>
<h3>Lu Bandit Wang Shiqi's Force Resolved</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Wang Shiqi's bandit gang in northern Shandong was previously ordered by the Shandong Provincial Government to be incorporated by Liu Guitang, the Deputy Commander of the Garrison Army stationed in Gaotang, and placed under Liu's command. However, Wang's troops did not change their bandit nature and continued to secretly engage in kidnapping and disrupt local order. Han Fuqu, the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, secretly ordered Liu Guitang to resolve Wang's forces to eliminate the harm to the local area. He also sent Xia Ziming, a counselor from the Provincial Government, to Gaotang on the 4th with the order to plan the resolution of Wang's forces with Liu. Wang's forces were originally stationed in the south gate of Gaotang. Liu then immediately ordered Liu Huaizhi's 1st Regiment to leave the east gate of Gaotang and surround the southeast, Wu Lianjie's 4th Regiment to leave the west gate and surround the southwest, and Zhang Fuwen's guard battalion to go straight out of the south gate. Yin Shijia's regiment also joined the assistance. At this time, although Wang Shiqi had noticed, he was unable to escape because he was surrounded on all sides, so he gathered his troops in the two civilian houses on the east and west sides of the street and opened fire to resist. Liu's troops also opened fire to coerce the surrender of weapons. At 4 PM, the civilian houses occupied by Wang's forces on the west side of the street were set on fire. Wang's forces then completely gathered in the houses on the east side of the street. After a fierce battle until 10 PM, Wang's forces were unable to support due to excessive casualties and attempted to break through in dense formations. Liu's troops met them head-on with a fierce attack. At this time, the gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls, and the sound shook for several miles. The remaining 60-70 members of Wang's forces left the south gate and first moved southwest, then turned northwest towards Xiajin. Liu's troops also tracked and pursued them. Wang's forces originally had 270-280 men, 220 rifles, and 80 horses. In this battle, 60-70 were killed, more than 100 were captured, more than 100 rifles were obtained, and all the horses were intercepted. Thus, they were no longer able to cause trouble in northern Shandong. More than 100 captured bandits are scheduled to be beheaded and displayed to the public in Gaotang today (6th). Liu will report to Han Fuqu by telegram, and Xia Ziming will also come to Jinan from Gaotang on the 6th to meet with Han and report the details of the resolution of Wang's forces. One platoon leader each from Liu's guard battalion and Wu Lianjie's regiment were killed in action. Zhang Fuwen, the battalion commander of the guard battalion, Yu Xinghuai, the fourth company commander, and Nie Hongxi, the messenger of the transmission team, were all injured. About ten soldiers were injured and were transported to Jinan for treatment. Also, one company commander of Wang's forces was captured and one was killed. As for the burned civilian houses, Liu has sent a letter to the county government to investigate and provide compensation. It is reported that Wang Shiqi was also shot and killed. (6th)</p>
<h3>Severe Disaster in Cangtai, Hubei</h3>
<p>▲ Mr. Ma Boyuan's Letter Respected Sir, On March 1st of this year, I returned to Zaoyang, Hubei, and immediately heard that the disaster situation in Cangtai was extremely severe, almost to the point of cannibalism. The area is located at the junction of Hubei and Henan, and the local officials shirk their responsibilities and ignore it. I was unable to go there immediately due to my busy schedule. Until the 20th, I saw countless people dismantling their houses to exchange for rice to prolong their remaining lives. I immediately sent a letter to Mr. Zhu Qinglan, the chairman of the Flood Relief Committee, asking him to find a way to provide relief. Later, I heard that Mr. Dong Xianzhang, a committee member, was sent to inspect the disaster area. At that time, I was away on business and was unable to meet with him. Now, on April 24th, Dagong Bao published a letter from Committee Member Dong Xianzhang, earnestly requesting donations from all sectors of society. I have reprinted it here and sent it to you for your perusal. I sincerely implore you to show great kindness and save these people whose lives are hanging by a thread. Do not think that a drop in the bucket is of no use. You must know that by gathering together, you can make a robe. If we give one more penny, the victims will receive one more penny of benefit. If you are willing to help, how can I alone express my gratitude? I also hope that you will widely publicize it to achieve the effect of lifting a weight together. I am in Yingchuan, making a plea on behalf of others, with utmost urgency. Ma Boyuan sincerely bows, ▲ Appendix Mr. Dong Xianzhang's Letter I, Xianzhang, arrived at Lutouzhen (under the jurisdiction of Zaoyang County) on April 7th and, in coordination with Jiang Dasan, Chen Daowu, and others, went to inspect the disaster area. On the 11th, I arrived at the central point, Cangtai Town, and saw desolate fields everywhere, with no end in sight. The stalks of sorghum, cotton, wheat, and other crops left over from last year were everywhere. About 80-90% of the houses and buildings in various villages were either burned by bandits, flooded, or dismantled and sold to maintain their lives. Villages such as Songwanzhai, XiaoguanTangzhai, Zhuyuanliuzhai, Daniejizhai, and Xugangzhai were attacked by bandits, and about 2,800 people died. Excluding these five villages, a total of 109 villages, about one mile long from north to south and about 35 miles wide from east to west, are in the disaster area. Within the disaster area, excluding those who drowned, were killed by bandits, died of illness or starvation, or fled, there are still 20,483 old, young, weak, and hungry people waiting to be fed. The young area was occupied by the bandits of the King Tai, a total of more than 10,000, in the border area of the four counties for more than two months, looting, extorting, and destroying all kinds of grains. In the 19th year, Cui Ergeng led more than 7,000 troops and occupied it for 73 days, burning, killing, raping, and wiping out pigs, sheep, cattle, and horses. In April of the 20th year, Wei Guozhu, Li Changyou, and others fraudulently claimed to be more than 10,000 troops of the Sixth Brigade and occupied it for more than three months. Less than 10% of the wheat was harvested. Seven major floods followed one after another, and those who were washed away without a trace have become withered mud. The water level on both sides of the Tang River rose by tens of feet. Countless houses collapsed. By the time the bandits left and the water receded, it was already past the autumn harvest season. Corpses were left unburied in villages and fields, and the stench filled the air, rushing into the brain and causing a widespread epidemic. No family or person was spared. In addition, there was no food or clothing, and no medicine for treatment, so many people died. The three major disasters in the three years have resulted in an extremely desolate and tragic situation. Within the disaster area, piles of corpses and white bones are everywhere. People eat tender grass, wild vegetables, and tree bark for a living. According to the survey, about 20 people die of starvation or suicide every day. There are no crops in the fields, and people have no vitality. Even if you look at the wheat fields, they have not been sown everywhere. Those who sell their sons and daughters do not get even a liter of chestnuts for one year. No one asks for the price of those who are too big or too small. Even after selling their children, they still have no money to escape the disaster. We inspected the area and couldn't help but shed tears all day long and sigh repeatedly. The disaster victims live in desolation during the day and accompany white bones at night. The cries of hunger and cold are endless. Children lose their fathers, wives mourn their husbands, and those who mourn their relatives and miss their children are endless. There are even cases where people are not yet dead and are eaten by dogs, which is unprecedented and a rare disaster in the world. Alas, heaven! The most painful thing for the people is nothing more than this. Although the Flood Relief Committee has sent a commissioner to inspect, I am afraid that the relief funds are too large and it will be difficult to achieve quick results. Moreover, it is located at the border of four counties, all of which are more than one hundred, eighty, or ninety miles away. At a time when the political situation is complicated, it is easy to shirk responsibility for troublesome procedures. I earnestly implore all Chinese and foreign kind people, gentlemen, fathers, brothers, sisters, and aunts to have great compassion, perform meritorious deeds that will never be met in ten thousand years, practice benevolence and charity, and have the enthusiasm to save people from suffering. Wealthy men and women who enjoy a superior life, reduce one dish of small dishes every day, elegant scholars who like to drink wine, reduce one cup of wine money per meal, righteous men who are used to playing money, can donate a lottery ticket, and gentle gentlemen, prepare some money for buying laughter, just like pulling hair from a felt, which will not cause any loss. Gather together to make a robe, and the refugees will benefit. If you are willing to donate generously, even a small amount will bring immeasurable blessings. If you are willing to give, please specify the Cangtai disaster area and send it to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, No. 1 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai, who will collect it on your behalf and remit it to the disaster area. I will also express my gratitude on your behalf. Dong Xianzhang, inspection commissioner of the Flood Relief Committee, respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>Administrative Yuan Relief for Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry</h3>
<p>▲Approval of Principles and Measures The Executive Yuan, at its meeting on the 10th, approved the principles and measures for relieving the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The principles are: (1) Cessation of export duties and special levies on raw silk; (2) Government subsidy of one hundred taels (silver) per shi (unit of volume) for factory silk and silk reeled from dried cocoons currently existing in Jiangsu and Zhejiang when exported. This subsidy should be paid in installments, temporarily advanced by banks, and offset by the central government's subsidy to abolish likin (internal transit taxes) agreements; (3) Responsible departments should liaise with banks regarding procedures such as purchasing new cocoons for reeling this year, and carefully plan measures to achieve practical results. The measures are: (1) Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will issue treasury bonds worth 2.2 million taels with an annual interest rate of six percent, to be repaid in four years. The aforementioned subsidy will be paid with these treasury bonds; (2) The financial circles of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will open up 3 million yuan for cocoon purchasing pledges; (3) The financial circles of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will do their utmost to accommodate manufacturers, following customary practices, and strive to open up silk cocoon pledges up to 4 million taels; (4) The two provincial governments will notify local chambers of commerce to encourage joint cooperation between silver houses and silk cocoon merchants; (5) The originally planned Cocoon Storage Consolidation Committee and Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Promotion Committee will be led by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to ensure practical progress. It is reported that the Executive Yuan has instructed the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce to comply and ordered the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to follow accordingly, with local communications.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>▲National Government Dispatches Commissioners to Survey the Shanghai-Hangzhou Provincial Highway The Shanghai-Hangzhou Provincial Highway is now being surveyed by Peng Liqi, a staff member of the Accounting Department of the Ministry of Finance and concurrent Director of the National Economic Council, and Hu Hanwen, Technical Director of the National Economic Council, dispatched by the National Government. They, along with two road experts, Mr. Poudril and Mr. Aukinji, sent by the League of Nations to China for inspection, arrived in Fengxian the day before yesterday (the 8th). County Magistrate Shen Qingchen welcomed and received them at the Shen Family Lotus Garden in Nanqiao. In the afternoon, they hired sedan chairs and proceeded to Tuolin for an on-site inspection. Simultaneously, Zhou Jiuxu, Director of the Construction Bureau, submitted the road construction plan for review. After discussion, it was decided that the section from Tuolin to Zhapu, connecting to Hangzhou, would utilize the original route of the Qin Gong coastal embankment to achieve twice the result with half the effort, with an estimated completion time of three months. On the other hand, a massive dock will be built between the Oriental Grand Port and Zhapu to facilitate development. The section from Tuolin to Nanqiao will be delayed until after August due to agricultural considerations. The original county road from Nanqiao through Pu (it is proposed to use a mechanized, movable wheel ferry) via Minhang to Shanghai is relatively narrow, and it is planned to widen it by two zhang (approximately 20 feet) to facilitate connection. As for the required funds, in addition to using the construction mu tax (tax levied per unit of land) from Fengxian, Jinshan, and Songjiang counties as a loan, the central government will provide a discretionary subsidy for the shortfall.</p>

When his mother refused, he beat her with a stick and stabbed her with a knife, assaulting her with fists and feet, causing her to bleed profusely, be covered in wounds, and collapse on the ground. Relatives intervened and sent the unfilial son to the county for legal action, but his mother died from her severe injuries. (Corrections) In yesterday's Fuzhou dispatch ("Bandits in Southern Fujian Mass in Nanjing"), in the seventh line, after "to Li Yangjing," it should connect to the tenth line of the Hankou dispatch ("Wuhan Planning Flood Prevention"), from "initiated begging for troops" to the twenty-second line, "ordered to assist Fujian," and then return to the eighth line from "Yudu arrived at the border of Ruijin and Changting at Baiyun Mountain."

<h3>Real Estate Association to Hold General Meeting</h3>
<p>▲Elect Committee Members for Property Rent Assessment Committee ▲Discuss Rent Collection and Water Meter Installation The Shanghai Real Estate Association has decided to hold a general meeting of all members at 3:00 PM on the 14th of this month at No. 96 Beijing Road to discuss important issues such as rent collection in and near the war zone and the installation of water meters by the Shanghai Waterworks Company. It will also elect one Chinese committee member to attend the Municipal Council's Property Rent Assessment Committee this term. All members have been notified yesterday. The issue of water meter installation is of particular concern to all sectors. Ma Haiyang Firm submitted a proposed solution to the Real Estate Association yesterday, stating that the Shanghai Waterworks Company will implement the area-based water meter installation on January 1st. Commentators said that high rents are beneficial to landlords, while low rents are detrimental to landlords. Regardless of whether the landlord has received rent, the landlord must pay the water bill to the Shanghai Waterworks Company on time. Currently, the calculation is approximately 75% of the rent or by water meter. Comparing the two, it accounts for five-tenths of the rental income. If the water bill after installation is higher than the previous calculation of 75% of the rent, then the excess should be divided equally among the tenants by the landlord. But this is difficult to implement in practice. Shanghai Electric Power Company, Shanghai Waterworks Company, and Real Estate Company all have business natures. Shanghai Electric Power Company and Shanghai Waterworks Company contract for fees. Fire meter deposits and cabinets are all handled directly with the users. Why is Shanghai Waterworks different? Moreover, tap water has nothing to do with landlords. Water meter deposits and cabinets should be collected directly by the Shanghai Waterworks Company from the tenants, and meters should be installed according to the Municipal Council's house number and by household. In this way, all three parties can be treated equally.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Rescue Team Concludes Mission and Returns to Shanghai</h3>

But they only had outpatient clinics, and the rescue work was not very active due to the subsiding of the war.</p>
<h3>Petitioning Process of the Postal Workers' Unions</h3>
<p>▲Chen Fumu Not Afraid of Guns and Bombs ▲Representatives Sincerely Explain Misunderstanding The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Staff Union have submitted a concrete plan to consolidate the postal system, details of which have been published in this newspaper. The four representatives sent by the unions to Beijing on the 3rd have returned to Shanghai on the 8th. According to reports, they met with Vice Minister Chen Fumu of the Ministry of Communications. Regarding the consolidation of the postal system, Vice Minister Chen stated that consolidating the postal service is the duty of the Ministry of Communications, and the opinions of the unions are extremely hateful. This Vice Minister will not tolerate such disruptive elements in the post office for a single day while he is in office. He vowed to eliminate them by deception. This Vice Minister believes that legitimate and feasible matters are not afraid of any opposition, guns, or bombs. The representatives then sincerely explained the misunderstanding and requested understanding. Finally, they agreed to accept consideration. Based on the above report, the members of the two unions feel that Vice Minister Chen does not seem to be inclined to adopt the plan proposed by the two unions. It is heard that the two unions will continue to strive to uphold their original intention of maintaining national industry and consolidating public interests.</p>

Hundreds of workers were blocked by the military police, and only representatives Feng Jifang, Chen Dongwu, Hu Kun, and five others were allowed to enter, requesting to meet with Mayor Wu, asking him to retract the order and instruct the employer to withdraw the layoff and salary notice. They were first received by Section Chief Xu of the Second Section, who only agreed to convey their intentions. The representatives repeatedly requested a meeting with the mayor. Section Chief Xu then telegraphed Secretary-General Yu, who was also busy with the takeover of Zhabei and did not return. It was delayed until 5:30 PM, when the public sentiment was very agitated, saying that if Mayor Wu did not meet with them, they would all refuse to return. Later, Section Chief Xu repeatedly explained and persuaded them to go back, and they returned in formation. Furthermore, the Relief Committee for Employees in Distress at the press presented a document to the Municipal Social Bureau yesterday, expressing their dissent, and sent a letter to the University Faculty Union, requesting assistance. The document to the Municipal Social Bureau stated, concerning the declaration of dissent and the request to notify the employer, that the association, on the 7th of this month, received Designation No. 1829 from your Bureau, which reads (omitted). Based on this, the Commercial Press previously requested mediation from your Bureau because the association borrowed 20 yuan per person from its members. During the mediation period, they suddenly applied for layoffs, which violates the provision of the Labor Dispute Resolution Law that layoffs are not allowed during the mediation period. However, your Bureau did not reject it according to the law but accepted it and issued two summonses to the association for mediation. Since the members of the association are scattered in all directions and opinions need to be solicited, they immediately declared the difficulty and requested that the employer's request be rejected. Later, they received a third mediation summons and appeared in court as scheduled, but the employer evaded and did not appear. The association believed that your Bureau should issue another summons on a fixed date, but unexpectedly, the case was directly presented to the municipal government. After only receiving two rounds of questioning, a decision was made based on that. However, after carefully examining the full text of the ruling, the association felt that it did not conform to the association's goal of requesting resumption of work, and the legal benefits of the labor agreement on which the association was based were completely overturned. Therefore, they are filing a dissent and will appeal to higher administrative authorities or the courts. They request your review and notification of the employer for the sake of public convenience. Respectfully presented to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau. The letter to the University Faculty Union stated, with respect, that the association members have suffered national disaster, their homes have been destroyed, their jobs have been suspended, and they have been displaced for three months. The authorities of the press not only did not provide any relief but seized the opportunity to add insult to injury. Recently, they submitted a request to the municipal government for approval of layoffs, intending to put thousands of cultural workers, who survived the disaster, on the brink of despair, which is contrary to law and reason, and truly heartbreaking. The association, in this situation, has no way to appeal and earnestly implores your union to uphold justice, provide righteous assistance, and speak out to uphold what is right. The letter is filled with urgent anticipation.</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest at Seeking New Factory Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>A labor dispute occurred among the workers at the Seeking New Shipyard, and the strike has lasted for several days. During the mediation period, the factory side created obstacles. Although the Social Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the General Labor Union, together with the representatives of the factory's labor union, have made every effort to negotiate, the factory side acknowledged yesterday morning that it would compensate for the deducted overtime wages with wages for the Huanghuagang Memorial Day holiday and recognize a general wage increase of five cents for all factory workers. The factory also agreed to pay wages for the two days of the strike. Four workers in the small wheel department were given a demerit once, and four workers were given a demerit twice. The labor side, in view of the national crisis, expressed its willingness to compromise, accepted the mediation of the higher authorities, and agreed to sign the agreement at 4:00 PM. However, the factory side suddenly reneged and refused to sign the agreement when it was time to sign, and instead proposed seven harsh conditions to the labor union representatives and dismissed four workers, causing great resentment among all the workers, who believed that the factory side was oppressing the workers too much and disregarding the mediation of the higher authorities. Therefore, they decided to fight to the end with all their strength. Furthermore, it is reported that labor unions such as the toothbrush and mercerized thread unions went to express their condolences yesterday and are willing to provide support.</p>

Traitors</p>
<h3>Cannot Live Peacefully in Zhabei</h3>
<p>▲ The Riverside Shanties of Jiangbei are Empty ▲ Regret Now What They Did Not Regret Before. When the Japanese army attacked Zhabei, a group of ignorant Jiangbei compatriots were bought by the Japanese to perform various tasks for them, such as scouting military intelligence and troop locations of our 19th Route Army and reporting them to the Japanese army, which used airplanes, bombs, and artillery to bombard our troop organs, such as the Huiwen Road Huzhou Guild Hall, the Taiyang Temple Road Jiajun Guild Hall, the Qianjiang Guild Hall, and the Tianxia Guild Hall (i.e., Yanshu Villa), which were all destroyed by Japanese artillery and airplanes. Countless nearby civilian houses were also affected. Since then, the term "Jiangbei traitor" has become a common term. Recently, the ceasefire agreement was signed, and the front-line Japanese soldiers have been withdrawing one after another. This type of traitor is no longer useful to the Japanese army and has been completely expelled. Despite repeated pleas, they have not received any attention from the Japanese army. It is also heard that the Japanese soldiers in Zhabei will also withdraw, and our Public Security Bureau will soon take over. These traitors are deeply afraid that if they stay in Zhabei, they will be reported and punished for treason in the future, and it will be difficult to escape the law. A wave of panic suddenly arose, and they moved away with their families. Yesterday, the shanties west of the intersection of Zhonghua New Road and Huta Road to the Pingjiang Bridge were completely empty. Many of the Jiangbei shanties on both sides of Pushan Road, Datong Road, Gonghe New Road North, Dayang Bridge, and Tanzhi Bay have also fled. However, there are still many traitors in Jiading, Nanxiang, Liuhe, and Luodian, who have returned to the Japanese army and are working for the Japanese soldiers digging trenches and building fortresses, or setting fires and spying on military intelligence behind our army. If they still do not know that the end is near, then such acts of treason, even if not punished by national law, will certainly not be tolerated by society.</p>
<h3>Large Number of White Russians Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Three hundred and ninety-six White Russians from Harbin and various places in the Ussuri region arrived in Shanghai via Dalian Bay on Japanese ships. They have already arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Second Major Robbery on Inland River Steamer</h3>
<p>▲ Losses Exceed 300,000 Yuan. In the past three months, inland river steamer business in Shanghai has been very prosperous. Because the Shen-Su route has been plagued by bandits along the way, there have been frequent robberies. Therefore, the early morning steamers were changed, departing Shanghai at 6:00 AM and arriving in Suzhou at 6:00 PM, to avoid danger along the way. Several companies have even chartered boats, and since then, there have been fewer robberies. However, recently, a major robbery occurred on an early morning steamer, with losses exceeding 300,000 yuan. After the incident, the parties involved kept it a secret. After detailed inquiries from various sources, the reporter learned the general situation as follows. Readers should not regard this as yesterday's news. A wealthy merchant named Jia from Suzhou fled to Shanghai due to the unstable situation in Suzhou. Recently, in view of the signing of the ceasefire agreement, he decided to move back to his hometown of Suzhou. Therefore, he booked many cabins from a steamer company in Shanghai a few days ago and packed all the belongings, money, jewelry, ornaments, and clothing he had brought with him into more than ten boxes and took the early morning boat back to Suzhou, thinking it was very safe. However, when boarding the ship, he was spotted by bandits, who planned to rob him. They followed him. It is said that two bandits disguised as passengers also mixed into the ship along with Merchant Jia. At the same time, a large gang of bandits was arranged to lie in ambush on sampans in the Xiehe Tang area, which the steamer had to pass through. Merchant Jia was still unaware. After the steamer set sail, around 10:00 AM, when it reached the Xiehe Tang river, the bandits in the ship sneaked out of the cabin and fired two warning shots with their pistols. The bandit boats, a total of more than ten, lying in ambush in the area, numbering about eighty or ninety bandits, all emerged upon hearing the sound and surrounded the ship. The bandits, indulging in robbery, first guarded the drivers, then entered the cabin to search and rob. Under the coercion of the bandits, Merchant Jia had no choice but to hand over all the belongings and boxes he had brought with him. The most important box, containing jewelry, diamonds, emeralds, gold ornaments, cash, etc., worth about 200,000 yuan, was also forced to be handed over by the bandits. At this point, Merchant Jia had no choice but to obey. All the boxes were carried onto the small boats by the bandits and taken away. During the robbery, an accountant on the steamer tried to escape. Just as he exited the cabin, he was shot by a bandit and hit in the foot. The accountant, after being injured, fell into the river. Fortunately, he knew how to swim and crossed the river to the shore, collapsing in a field. The bandits then proceeded to search and rob the passengers on the same ship, even stripping off better clothes and searching out hidden money. One passenger had 50 silver dollars hidden in his socks. 25 dollars in his right sock was taken away, while the 25 dollars in his left sock was not found and was preserved. The remaining passengers, even if they had only one or two dollars, were robbed. The eighty or ninety bandits, dressed in various clothes, some wearing uniforms and posing as soldiers, each carrying pistols and weapons, took about an hour to complete the search and robbery. Before leaving, they fired more than ten shots and then fled. The robbed steamer ran aground. Afterwards, another steamer came to tow it out of the shallows, and it continued to Suzhou. It was three or four hours late when it arrived in Suzhou. The shot accountant was rescued by the original boat and taken to a Suzhou hospital for treatment. After this incident occurred, the parties involved insisted on keeping it a secret, warning those involved not to publicize it. The steamer company also did not want to publicize it, fearing it would harm business. Therefore, few outsiders know about it. In this case, the loss was only for Merchant Jia, who was robbed of more than 300,000 yuan. Passengers also lost more than 3,000 gold. This major robbery case and the previous case of Sun Zhenqiu being robbed on his way from Wuxi to Shanghai can be said to be unparalleled. Sand Boats and Civilian Boats</p>
<h3>Must Move to Anchorage South of Dongjiadu Pujiang Riverfront</h3>
<p>▲ Public Announcement Issued Jointly by Public Security Bureau and Public Works Bureau. Public Announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and Public Works Bureau: Regarding the issuance of a joint public announcement, it has been found that the section of the Pujiang riverfront from the 16th Pier to Dongjiadu in the South Shanghai District has long been designated by the Municipal Government as a wharf area for steamers. The mooring of sand boats and civilian boats in this section of the riverfront not only hinders the berthing and departure of steamers but also slows down the tidal flow, making it easier for silt to accumulate. In order to rectify the traffic on the Pujiang River, our bureaus have previously ordered that all such sand boats and civilian boats must be moved to anchor south of Dongjiadu. It has recently been found that the aforementioned boats have gradually returned to their original locations, which truly obstructs traffic. In addition to the strict enforcement of regulations by the Wharf and Warehouse Management Office of the Public Works Bureau in conjunction with the Water Patrol Division of the Public Security Bureau, a public announcement is hereby urgently issued, ordering all sand boat owners and civilian boat owners to comply and move to anchor south of Dongjiadu. This is announced on May 6, the 21st year of the Republic of China. Wen Yingxing, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Public Works Bureau.</p>
<h3>Rape and Coercion Case</h3>
<p>▲ Shi A'gen's True Colors: A Lewd Daredevil ▲ A Pitiful Female Worker Stripped Naked ▲ Should Be Severely Punished in the Prostitution Prevention Center. Shi A'gen, from Jiangyin, 24 years old, lives at 188 Hejian Road and works in the furnace room of the Shenxin Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road. He is known for his lecherousness, spending lavishly on prostitutes, leaving his own marriage unfulfilled. Ge A'da, a 23-year-old woman from Changzhou, works as a female worker at the Shanghai No. 5 Yarn Factory on the same road. Although she is over 20 years old, she is still a virgin. Shi, being a lecherous man, coveted Ge and wanted to defile her, but had no opportunity. Hu Liu'mei, who also works in the factory, happens to be Shi's relative and lives with Shi. He told her his desires, and around 7 PM on February 12th, they conspired together and tricked Ge into going to their house. They used threatening tactics to pull her into the bedroom, press her onto the bed, and strip her completely naked. They threw her clothes and pants out the door and had Hu Liu'mei take them away to hide them. He told her that now that she was here, she couldn't escape, and if she resisted, she would be in danger. The woman dared not resist and let Shi do as he pleased, confining her for three nights. Later, the woman fasted and begged to be released, and was finally given clothes and released. The woman went outside and returned to the dormitory of the yarn factory on Pingliang Road, arranged her clothes and belongings, and returned to her hometown by boat, not daring to make a sound. Because she was already betrothed to a certain man from the same hometown, she heard that the yarn factory she had been working at was about to reopen, so she came to Shanghai. When she passed by Yangpu Road, she happened to meet Shi A'gen. The woman lowered her head and ignored him. Shi shouted loudly at the woman, "Do you recognize me?" The woman said she didn't know him, and they started arguing. Someone reported to Chinese Detective Shen Yuzhou, who arrived and inquired about the situation, and then arrested Shi and took him to the Yangshupu Police Station. The captain ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court, High Division One. According to the statement of the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, the case involves the fact that the doctor examined the woman Ge A'da and confirmed that she was a virgin recently deflowered, with a white discharge in the middle of her lower part. The defendant, being a frequent visitor to brothels, had previously contracted lymphogranuloma venereum and gonorrhea, and Ge was also infected. The defendant admitted in the police station that he had had intercourse with Ge eight times. Please examine the medical certificate. Then Ge A'da explained the previous situation and requested that the defendant be punished. When questioned, Shi A'gen stammered in his statement, saying that the woman now had another lover and ignored him. At that time, she said that the unmarried couple in her hometown were ugly and came to Shanghai to marry another husband, and asked his relative Hu Liu'mei to act as a pimp for him. Judge Shen Bingrong verified the statement and ordered him to be remanded in custody pending a scheduled hearing. The Japanese Army Occupation Period's</p>
<h3>Zhabei Robbery Case</h3>
<p>▲ Residents Unwilling to Report to the Japanese Military Police. A certain egg factory in Zhabei, Hujia Wooden Bridge (i.e., Linping Road), was known by bandits to be distributing wages a few days ago. They gathered their accomplices and went to rob the factory, stealing about 10,000 yuan. The Japanese military police stationed in the area learned of this and immediately dispatched a large team of military police to search everywhere, but they were nowhere to be found. Yesterday, it was heard that the Japanese military police notified the various factories and large stores, ordering them to install alarm bells and saying that if wages were to be distributed in the future, they could notify the military police in advance to send troops to protect them. It is said that the various manufacturers, believing that the Japanese soldiers will soon withdraw and the police power will be restored soon, would rather endure a few more days than take such a shameful action.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldier's Vehicle Kills Pedestrian</h3>
<p>▲ Witness Testifies that Vehicle Took Wrong Route ▲ Western Detective States Japanese Side Made No Report. Around 7:00 AM on the 8th of this month, at the corner of Taopeng Road and Yangshupu Road, Zhang Xiaoping, a man resembling a worker, about 31 or 32 years old, was walking on the south side of the road when he was suddenly knocked down by a Japanese military truck No. 32 coming from the west (according to regulations, the vehicle should have been driving on the north side of the road). He was seriously injured, and the vehicle continued to speed forward. The Chinese officer No. 1083 on duty at the post saw this and rushed to report it to the Yangshupu Police Station, which ordered a detective to investigate and sent an ambulance to take the injured man to the hospital. He died shortly after treatment proved ineffective. The body was taken to the autopsy center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei of the First Special District Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Wei Ligong, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the center and took their official positions. According to the witness Yan Yongxiang, 27 years old, from Ningbo, who works at the Ewo Yarn Factory, he did not know the deceased. When he was on his way to work that day, he saw the man walking west on the road four feet away from the cement road when he was knocked down by a Japanese military truck. The vehicle was driving very fast at the time and definitely took the wrong route. According to the Western captain of the police station, the police station has already written a report on the case and sent it to the Japanese Command, but there has been no response to date. Prosecutor Guo, having obtained the statement, then ordered that the deceased Zhang Xiaoping was indeed injured and killed by Japanese military truck No. 32. The body was handed over to the Pushan Funeral Home for burial. Lack of Freedom in Marriage</p>
<h3>Xie Jiwu Shoots Himself</h3>
<p>▲ Life in Grave Danger Xie Jiwu, a 34-year-old man from Ningbo, a wealthy man residing at No. 31, Lane 282, Jing'an Temple Road, was formerly a comprador for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Guangji steamship. Having just returned from Hong Kong three days ago, around 6:00 PM yesterday, he drank five or six glasses of Ska wine alone. After drinking, he was slightly intoxicated and walked into the room, closing the door. He then used a pistol he had brought with him to shoot himself. With a loud bang, the bullet pierced his right temple, and he fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. A maid happened to be going upstairs to fetch something and suddenly heard a gunshot coming from the room. Realizing that something was wrong, she quickly reported it to his mistress, who tried to pry open the door. They saw that Xie was already barely breathing and lying next to the bed. They quickly summoned a doctor from the nearby Sino-German Hospital, who performed surgery and transferred him to the Baolong Hospital, where he was placed in room 302. It is said that the injury was critical and his life was in grave danger. It is said that Xie's parents are both alive and well, and he is an only son. His suicide this time was due to a lack of freedom in marriage.</p>
<h3>Suspecting Wife of Infidelity, Opens Fire on Friend</h3>
<p>▲ Wife Not Like Modern Woman ▲ Friend Suffers Gunshot Wound, Not Fully Recovered. Sha Zhaoping, a Shandong native, and Bai Yufu both work as drivers for the public bus company. Sha lives at No. 638 Gordon Road in Western Shanghai. His wife, Ms. Chen, is only 19 years old and of average appearance. Because Bai often visits Sha's home, they do not avoid suspicion, and after a long time, there is much gossip, which Sha hears. Suspecting his wife of infidelity and resenting his friend's lack of etiquette, he sent his nephew Sha Youdu to invite Bai to a bar to get drunk on the night of the 23rd of last month. On the way back, they passed through Jiangjia Lane. At that time, everything was silent, and the place was remote and sparsely populated. Bai walked in front of Sha, following closely. Sha Zhaoping took advantage of Bai's unpreparedness and pulled out a Browning pistol, aiming it at the back of Bai's head. With a loud bang, the bullet hit the back of his neck, and Bai fell to the ground. Sha's uncle and nephew then fled together. The police station in charge of the area learned of this and ordered the arrest of the injured man to be sent to the hospital for treatment, and at the same time tracked down the murderer. It was not until 1:30 AM yesterday morning that Chinese Detective Shen Chongli learned that Sha Zhaoping and Sha Youqing were hiding in room 16 of the Anle Hotel in the Taiyuan Fang on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. He immediately contacted the French police station and dispatched additional detectives to go with them to arrest the two Sha's together and bring them back to the police station. At 9:00 AM, the injured man Bai Yufu and Sha's wife Chen were summoned and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. Bai's wound was not fully healed, and his head was still wrapped in a white bandage, while Sha's wife Chen wore a purple jacket and had her braids hanging down, looking nothing like a modern woman. First, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case for the prosecution. Judge Wu then questioned the two sides one by one about the circumstances of the incident and ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Northern Salted Fish Arrives in Songjiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the end of last month, fourteen or fifteen northern yellow croaker boats have arrived in Wusong. Up to now, no fish boats have arrived in Songjiang for two seasons. In the Hupu area, more than 100 yellow croaker boats have arrived for two seasons in the past few days. The Wusong Baofeng, Cuisheng, and Shentai three fish companies were looking forward to it. Yesterday morning, two northern salted fish boats, named Mafaxing and Hanzhishun, arrived suddenly. The Baofeng Fish Company was selling them at 18.6 yuan per dan. Because the fish were brightly colored and clean, with large strips, the market was very active. According to the fishermen, there are quite a lot of salted fish and dried fish. It is estimated that a large number will be imported in the next few days. Shelter Employee</p>
<h3>Abducts Refugee's Wife</h3>
<p>▲ Intercepted by Boy Scouts at the Dock Ding Weiyi, from Yancheng, lost his house in Zhabei due to the fires of war and took his wife, Ding Liu, 24 years old, to the No. 11 Shelter on Xinzha Road. His wife was of good looks. Zheng Weixi, an employee in the shelter who distributed food to the refugees every day, saw that she was beautiful and took great care of her. Ding, greedy for the convenience, became enamored. On the 4th of this month, he hid Ding and secretly obtained a boat ticket from the shelter, planning to escape to Baoying by boat the next day. Ding Weiyi suddenly found his wife missing but did not know who had abducted her. Later, a refugee said that he often saw Ding and Zheng talking and laughing under the escalator. Ding reported this to the shelter, which realized that Zheng was planning to escape, so it sent five boy scouts to guard the dock. Zheng and Ding indeed arrived together and were arrested and brought to the First District Police Station. They were sent to court yesterday for investigation. Guanghua Cinema Company's</p>
<h3>Verdict in Accountant Robbery Case</h3>
<p>▲ Shi Yinbao Sentenced to 15 Years. Wu Jian'guang, an accountant at the Guanghua Cinema on Avenue Edward VII, was carrying 585 yuan in cash to the Lianhua Film Company on Hong Kong Road at 10:30 AM on the 2nd of this month when he was robbed by bandits Shi Yinbao, Yang A'er, and three others. Shi fired a shot and fled. Deputy Detective Tang Jian and others from the Xinzha Police Station pursued and captured Shi and Yang and recovered the stolen goods, while the pistol held by Shi was taken away by his accomplices. The next morning, the police station sent the two bandits to the First Special District Court. The circumstances of the trial have been reported previously. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi proposed a continued hearing on the case. The two bandits admitted to the armed robbery without denial. However, Shi said that he did not intend to shoot, but shot only because the victim was chasing him from behind, intending to scare the victim away, without any intention of killing him. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang and the lawyer appointed by the court to defend the defendant mutually argued. Judge Wu immediately announced the verdict: Shi Yin, found guilty of armed robbery, was sentenced to eight years imprisonment; for the crime of attempted murder, reduced to twelve years imprisonment; to be executed with fifteen years imprisonment. Yang A'er, found guilty of armed robbery, was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. The number of days detained before the judgment was determined shall be deducted at two days for each day. A bicycle was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Change of Judges</h3>
<p>Zhang Chaozuo, a judge of the Second Special District Court of Jiangsu, was previously transferred to the High Third Branch Court to serve as a judge in the Criminal Division. Now, he has been ordered to return to the original court to serve as a judge in the Criminal Division, to hear criminal preliminary public prosecution cases from the police station on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday court sessions. Judge Zhang arrived at the court yesterday to oversee and hear cases. Also, Xiong Huihua, a judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, received a letter from home at the beginning of last month, learning that his mother was ill. He requested leave to return to his native Anhui province to visit his relatives. His mother, due to her advanced age and physical decline, did not respond to medical treatment and passed away on the 28th of last month. After completing the funeral arrangements, Judge Xiong immediately set out to return to Shanghai, arriving the night before last. He reported to the court yesterday to cancel his leave and resumed his duties as usual.</p>
<h3>Zhang Mingqin, District Chief of the Third District, Departure</h3>
<p>▲ The newly appointed Yu Baozhen took over yesterday. Ren Liping, the former District Chief of the Sixth District of the Public Security Bureau, passed away suddenly due to illness. The vacancy was filled by Wen, the Bureau Chief, who transferred Zhang Mingqin, the District Chief of the Third District of Pudong, to take over. The vacancy left by the District Chief of the Third District was filled by Yu Baozhen, an assistant in the Second Section of the General Bureau. This was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the leaders of various public organizations and prominent businessmen in Pudong, considering that District Chief Zhang has been in office for three years and has spared no effort in maintaining local security. After the January 28th Incident, he was even more diligent in planning defenses day and night, responding appropriately. The locality relied on him for peace and tranquility, truly a rare and commendable official among police officers. They decided to jointly sign and stamp a petition to Bureau Chief Wen, requesting him to withdraw the order and refrain from transferring him, to retain an experienced hand. However, the petition had just been submitted yesterday morning when the newly appointed District Chief Yu arrived at the district office at ten o'clock to take over. The representatives were greatly disappointed and hired a military band and a photographer to take a group photo with Zhang, and publicly presented him with a silver shield as a memento. Those who participated that day included members of the security team, the fire brigade, all members, and Boy Scouts from various schools, totaling no less than a thousand people. Subsequently, they escorted him along the way with cheers and continuous firecrackers, until they reached the Lujiazui Wharf where the well-wishers shook hands with District Chief Zhang and bid him farewell.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Murder in Wusong</h3>
<p>▲ The Danger of Anarchy: Since the outbreak of the war in Wusong, the security teams and police have all fled, and the area is now in a state of anarchy. The people have no one to protect them. Last night, the home of Xu Aisheng, a farmer in the Xu Jiaxiang Village south of Yuncao Creek, was suddenly attacked by more than 20 robbers speaking in a Hakka accent, armed with sharp knives and broadswords. They broke into the house, and when Xu Aisheng saw them, he shouted loudly to catch the thieves. As a result, he was stabbed in the abdomen with a sharp knife and immediately collapsed and died. The robbers then searched the house for gold jewelry and cash, making off with their loot in a loud uproar. Xu Aisheng was 59 years old and from a well-to-do family. His son has already placed him in a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Increased Sentence After Appeal for Robbers</h3>
<p>▲ Twelve Years Changed to Fourteen Years: The robber Huang Quanlin, in the past month, gathered a gang and held weapons to commit robbery in the French Concession and took loot. On the way, they happened to meet a detective inspecting pedestrians, leading to their arrest. Handguns and bullets were seized, and they were sent to the Second Special Court. After a clear investigation, they were sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. However, Huang was dissatisfied and hired a lawyer to write a petition and appeal to the High Third Branch Court. The Criminal Division Chief Lu Yimei, along with judges Guo and Zhao, and prosecutor Zhang, opened a court to hear the case and declared the debate closed. Yesterday, when the judgment period arrived, at three o'clock in the afternoon, Chief Judge Lu and others went to the Second Criminal Court and ordered the appellant to be brought to the court. The original judgment was revoked. Huang Quanlin, carrying a weapon for armed robbery, was sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment.</p>

The Ministry of Justice stated in its proposal that execution is closely related to judgment, so all law schools previously had prison studies courses, which was a good intention.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Bidding</h3>
<h3>In Strong Progress</h3>
<p>▲Improved Environment...Active Spot Sales: The Cotton Yarn Market Is Very Firm, and the Rising Trend Is Sharp, Really Because Various Parties Have Been Stagnant for a Long Time. Now, They See the Environment as Good, and the Yarn Price Has Fallen Significantly Compared to Its Peak. The Japanese Army Is Systematically Withdrawing, and Inland Cloth Factories Are Preparing to Resume Operations. Therefore, They Are Actively Purchasing, and People's Hearts Are Excited, Making the Market Very Lively. However, According to the Global Situation, the Cotton Industry Is Unlikely to Have an Active Rising Trend. Japanese Factories Are Working Very Hard, the U.S. Cotton Market Is Still Depressed, and There Are War Clouds Looming in the Northeast. Tianjin and Other Places Have a Problem of Japanese Yarn Overflowing. Therefore, Chinese Factories Are Taking This Opportunity to Sell, and There Is No Concern About Increasing the Bottom Stock. ▲Bidding Rises Sharply by Three Tael and Six Qian: In the Pre-Market Bidding, Because the Market Was Closed the Previous Day, Yarn Sales Were Already Strong, Causing People's Hearts to Be Very Tight. Today, It Is Heard That Sales to Customers Are Still Good, and There Is a Lack of Sellers and Retailers in the Market to Make Up for the Situation, So the Market Is Even Tighter. Each Month Rises by 1 Tael and 6 Qian to 2 Tael. In the Afternoon Market, The Market Is Still Strong, and There Is a Lack of Sellers. Each Month Rises by Another 1 Tael and 3 Qian to 2 Tael.

<h3>The Cotton Market Is in a Stable State</h3>
<p>▲The Spot Market Seems to Have a Long Quiet Desire to Move: The Cotton Market Is Calm, But the Indian and U.S. Cotton Markets Are Still Falling. According to the Situation, It Is Very Dull. However, Domestic Cotton Still Has Tight Hearts Due to a Lack of Inventory. In This Old Cotton Era, There Is a Lack of Certainty, So Transactions Are Still Clear. However, the Han Group Has a Firm Attitude and Is Still in a Long Position. Shenxin and Chongxin Factories Occasionally Trade in This Local Cotton. The Future of the Cotton Market Is Difficult to Predict. ▲Zheng Bidding Is Stable: The Zheng Bidding Pre-Market Opening Showed the U.S. and Indian Cotton Markets Falling Again, and People's Hearts Softening.

<h3>U.S. Cotton Rose Back After Falling Last Week</h3>
<p>The New York Telegram on May 6 Reported the Cotton Market Conditions for a Week. The Cotton Market Initially Felt Weak This Week, But Then Slightly Rose Back, Because the Agricultural Bureau Had Announced the Policy on Selling Its Stored Cotton, Which Was Generally Considered to Be of a Constructive Nature. However, the Cotton Market Was Still Not Stable Because Several Bills in Congress Had Not Been Decided. However, When the Buying Trend Stopped, There Were Slight Sales, and the Market Price Loosened. The Active Sales at the Beginning of This Week Included Hedging Sales Transactions That Covered Yarn Factory Stored Cotton or Inventory, and There Was Still No Demand for Cotton Goods at That Time. It Is Also Said That Domestic Cotton Factories Will Reduce Production Again. Old Bulls Also Closed Out a Lot, And Some With Spot in the South Also Sold Out a Certain Amount. However, the Base Price in the South Had Steadily Strengthened. It Is Rumored That Japanese Merchants Were Buying in the Southwest. The Temperature Was Not High, Which Hindered Germination and Cotton Seed Development, But the Recent Rainfall Has Improved. Expressing the Condition of Silk and Tea.</p>
<h3>Road Village Suian Fine Eyebrow Opening</h3>
<p>▲Opening an unprecedented high price　　The Road Village Suian Fine Eyebrow Green Tea arrived yesterday, with the first batch of over one hundred and thirty boxes of new goods being transported by tea firms such as Yuan Fengrun, Yong Xinglong, and Gong Sheng Yong. All were exclusively purchased by Jinlong Foreign Firm. Among them, one hundred and eight boxes were of the ordinary grade, priced at one hundred and seventy taels; over thirty boxes were of the heart-extracted grade, priced at one hundred and ninety taels, which is forty to fifty taels higher than last year, opening an unprecedented high price in history. Currently, the firm is actively packaging and transporting the purchased Fine Eyebrow tea to Morocco in order to take advantage of the new season. Regarding the Earth Village Fine Eyebrow tea, over three hundred boxes of new samples were released yesterday. Firms such as Xiehe and Yihe purchased over one hundred boxes yesterday. However, due to the Chinese side's exorbitant asking price, negotiations have mostly failed to reach an agreement, and the future market is not expected to be very brisk.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Huzhou Rough Tea Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, tea firms such as Yitongxing and Tongyifeng transported over two hundred packages of rough tea from Huzhou. The mountain price for the incoming goods is ninety-four to ninety-five yuan per share, resulting in extremely high costs. Currently, various tea firms are actively employing workers to rush production in order to meet market demand.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Tea Production Suffers Damage</h3>
<p>The world's most popular Wuyuan Gao Zhuang green tea has recently begun to be harvested and processed. Coupled with the unusually hot weather in the past two days, and the hailstorm yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon, the tea buds are developing extremely rapidly. The tender tips that were previously suppressed by the cold are now vigorously sprouting and growing long. Mountain households are deeply concerned that the tea will emerge all at once, making it impossible to harvest and process in time. They are all hiring workers to help. Starting today (the 4th), all villages have begun a coordinated harvesting effort. However, according to the estimates of mountain households, the production quantity is lower than the harvest in previous years. Moreover, this year's tea rice, wages, and commodity prices are all rising, and the firm does not have funds to provide assistance. Mountain households are suffering from economic hardship and are all complaining bitterly. It is expected that the future mountain price will not only not decrease compared to the past, but may even have to increase.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms' Silk Market Increasingly Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firms' silk market continued to be dull. This is because the European and American raw silk markets are almost entirely dominated by Japanese silk sales. Factory owners and others are quoting extremely low prices, but sales are stagnant. Shanghai's European and American firms only accepted fourteen bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk of top grade thirteen to fifteen thread count from Lianna Jin Tieji, priced at six hundred and forty-five taels; and five bales of top grade over-basin yellow coarse silk with Yi Chang brand head from Kechang Jin Wei, priced at three hundred and forty taels. It is said that these were all fill-in transactions.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Situation Stable</h3>
<p>▲Yesterday, fewer than twenty rice boats from various districts in South Shanghai arrived. The port inventory is weak, and the demand from urban and rural shops is limited. The market initially remained stable. The market for Changshu Jiging top grade, inferior grade, and Tongli Bei's rice was slightly firmer by several points. Only scattered thin rice arrived, and the Ningbo demand was still weak. Guest firms and local dealers made slight accommodations. The opening price increased, but the selling price decreased. The price of Lu Bu's sharp rice and foreign sharp rice was slightly affected by foreign rice, with a slight decrease of a few corners.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, twenty to thirty sources of rice from the Inner Road in North Shanghai arrived. The local trade was initially active but later became stagnant. Coupled with the weather turning sunny, the incoming goods increased. Rice mills still have a small amount of inventory. Rural sales are very brisk, and the situation is promising. The trade in Suzhou Chang top grade rice and early thin rice was flat. The opening price decreased by five cents to one corner. Not much glutinous rice arrived, and the market situation did not change much. Foreign Du sharp rice was sold as soon as it arrived, and the price did not fluctuate. The port's sharp rice was out of stock and without a market.</p>
<h3>Reaction After the Surge in Foreign Rice Prices</h3>
<p>▲Small mixed rice declines by a small corner.　　Yesterday's foreign rice market situation was due to the sharp increase in prices by three or four corners in the previous two days. Local merchants felt the price was too high and were all observing and not making any purchases. The Hankou route still had a strong demand, but after increasing the water transport fee from this week, they all stopped and observed. Therefore, the market situation in the morning was very weak, and the price of all rice decreased by about one corner. At noon, merchants from Chongming and other inland routes, as well as local merchants, took advantage of the small price and searched for purchases, and the market situation began to stabilize. It is estimated that two thousand packages of small mixed rice were sold, priced at ten yuan, six corners, and three cents to ten yuan and four cents. Old small mixed rice was priced at ten yuan, one corner, and seven cents. Min Dang rice was sold at five hundred packages, priced at ten yuan, eight corners, and five cents to ten yuan, seven corners, and five cents. Small mixed brown rice was sold at five hundred packages, priced at nine yuan and six corners. The rollover period small mixed rice成交 was two hundred tons, with the May contract at five liang and eight fen, which was also slightly higher by two to three fen compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Initially Rises and Then Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market initially rose and then weakened. Foreign wheat did not fluctuate much, with only four or five cents difference. The current flour sales are flat. Both northern and southern merchants do not have a large demand, and only make slight accommodations when the price is low. The futures price for the May contract for the troop transport ship initially opened at two liang, four fen, and a half. The May contract for the old vehicle opened at two liang, four fen, and two and a half cents. Due to the return of bullish investors, the troop transport ship decreased to two liang, two fen, and two and a half cents. After the market price decreased, there was a conflict between some employees and customers, and the market became chaotic. In the end, it recovered to two liang and three cents. The old vehicle brand also reached two liang and three cents.</p>
<h3>Green Lead Sales Rebound</h3>
<p>After the tea merchants stopped purchasing green lead, the market trend weakened, and the standard price fell. It was estimated that the opening price was thirteen taels and five or six qian per dan. In recent days, export merchants from Tianjin, the Yangtze River, Fujian, and other districts have jointly made purchases, causing the market to expand and the standard price to rise again. The opening price has reached thirteen taels and eight qian per dan. It was found that five to six hundred bars were sold yesterday. However, those who intend to make additional purchases are still very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Random Notes on Japan (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Ou Qi</p>
<p>A military shrine was recently built in Tokyo. It is of grand scale and commemorates a certain general who died in the Shanghai battle. One day, I asked a Japanese friend, "Who does your country's military god refer to?" The Japanese friend said, "It is Ricarite Takashi, the army minister who was sent to Shanghai. Because of his bravery and skill in battle, he made significant contributions during the Russo-Japanese War. Therefore, the people of our country (referring to Japan) all call him a military god and a national treasure." From this, it can be seen that Ricarite had already died in the Shanghai battle. I remember when our army retreated on March 1st, it was widely rumored in Shanghai that Shirakawa had died in Liuhe. It was probably a mistake for Ricarite. The military cliques within Japan monopolize power, and disputes arise from time to time. The Inukai Cabinet is nothing more than a puppet. The Shanghai battle inflicted a heavy blow on the Japanese army. Inukai severely criticized Araki and others for their aggressive militarism. One day, he went to see Araki and strongly advised him to make peace with China. He also said, "Bihira once said that invading China is like swallowing a bomb. Now you can understand it." Araki was greatly embarrassed and angrily said, "Who are you? Our imperial army belongs to the emperor and the army minister. How can your cabinet interfere?" He slapped his face and drew his gun at him. Inukai had no choice but to leave dejectedly. As for the Chinese who travel to Japan, they have been subjected to great harm since the Shanghai battle. Whenever they walk in the street, they are often beaten or spat on by Japanese rogues. Mud, stones, fruit peels, or sewage are often thrown from the windows. All kinds of insults are endless. Some have even been killed. The police do not care about it. In February of this year, my shop's partner, Mr. Liu, had a quarrel with a Japanese rogue. The next day, Mr. Liu went out to buy vegetables and was taken away by the Japanese rogue. There was no news. I immediately reported it to the police station, but there was no result. Half a month later, Mr. Liu's head was suddenly found in a nearby bay. I reported it to the police station again. The police station pretended that the murderer had been arrested and dealt with according to the law. Unexpectedly, this news was learned by the rogues, who gathered a crowd with weapons that night and broke into the house, destroying the equipment, beating the shop partners, and looting the goods. I was able to escape by jumping over the wall. When the patrolmen arrived, they had already left with a roar. Alas, our country has not yet perished, but our overseas compatriots have already deeply felt the pain of national subjugation.</p>
<h3>Green Russia and the Unlucky Number</h3>
<p>— Kai Xu</p>
<p>The assassination of French President Doumer this time shocked the world. His various circumstances regarding the murderer are naturally also the focus of attention of the world. It is found that the murderer Goglloff is Russian. However, according to his wife, Goglloff is neither Red Russian nor White Russian, but Green Russian. Although he deeply hates the communist system, he does not advocate restoring the autocracy of the former Russian Emperor. Therefore, there is the name of the Green Russian Party. This kind of Green Russian has no political propositions. What they seek is nothing more than to live and work in peace and not be subject to political constraints. Most of the Russians who have been expelled from the country and live in all directions belong to this kind of people. They are called Green Russians, but there is no need to organize them. Green represents bleakness and sadness, and also represents jealousy and hatred. It is also the case that in today's world, disasters are inherited from each other, and the resentment and poison are surging on the earth. Occasionally being hit is enough to stir up a huge wave. The French President was only touched occasionally and lost his life as a result. I am sad for Doumer and also afraid for the future of the world. French President Doumer was the thirteenth president of France. The day he was elected was May 13th of last year. And the day he was assassinated happened to be Friday. Thirteen is an unlucky number in the West. In the last gathering of Jesus, there were thirteen people in the same seat. Since then, throughout the ages, thirteen has been considered unlucky. The reason why hospitals do not have room number thirteen is this meaning. Furthermore, the number five is also unlucky. Therefore, May and Friday are both considered to contain unlucky meanings. Now Doumer was elected president on May 13th and was shot by a madman on a Friday in May of the following year. Is there any evidence for superstitious matters? Or is it just a coincidence of unlucky numbers?</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The so-called (Ceasefire Agreement) signed by the political government has been denied by the whole country, but in fact, it only expresses public opinion! But from this, it can be proved that the government's negotiations with Japan have always been concessionary and submissive. There is no determination to resist, only the preparation to sign a treaty of national betrayal! We hate Yuan Shikai for signing the Twenty-One Demands. In fact, under the rule of the Party, how much different is it from Yuan Shikai's dictatorship? Alas! The government and the people are running in opposite directions. (Going to the national crisis together) is simply a dream! Some people say: (The Japanese army, navy, and air force triumphantly returned home!) In fact, how have they ever returned home? They are going to our Northeast to continue their aggression and to exert more forceful oppression on the volunteer army. With the signing of the (Ceasefire Agreement), the Japanese army has a more advanced plan. Isn't this the government inviting disaster? Shanghai is easing, the Northeast is strained. The situation at Yuguan is dangerous, and Shanhaiguan is in danger of being lost at any moment. I don't know what attitude the government will take towards this?</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaokui's Willow Catkin Poem</h3>
<p>— Floating Name</p>
<p>Shi Zhaokui, the secretary of the Chinese delegation currently following Gu Weijun out of the pass, is often mistaken by those who do not know him for being from the same family as (Shi Zhaoji) because of the similarity of their names. In fact, they are not. Shi Zhaokui is from Weiyang, with the alias Deqian. He traveled to the United States early in his life and became acquainted with Gu, who valued him highly. During the Beijing government era, when Gu served as prime minister, he appointed Shi as an assistant in the Secretariat of the State Council. Last year, when Gu served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shi held the position of Director of the General Affairs Department and concurrently served as the Chief of the Ceremonial Affairs Section. Although it was not for long, Gu's social correspondence was mostly written by Shi. Shi is proficient in both Chinese and English and is quite refined. I remember that the willow catkin poem he composed in his early years can be called a masterpiece. It was once published in the Brocade Bag Poem Collection. It is now specially transcribed below. Let every thread be unbound, Scattering across the sky as verdant beginnings spread. Floating life remains unsettled in its journey, Shimmering reflections deceive parting individuals. Drifting everywhere like wandering souls, With no desire to bid farewell to fading spring. A reckless profusion of romantic seeds in Jiangnan, Half become duckweed, half become dust. In my opinion, this poem is full of emotions. Its neck and belly couplets are nothing more than a portrayal of the current situation of leaving the pass. If Shi were to see and recite it in this dusty and weary state, I expect that he would surely increase his feelings of the past and present.</p>
<h3>Record of the Twin Towers in the Military (48)</h3>
<p>— Owner of the Quest for Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Episode Six Pitiful Dream Night Forced into an Alliance Under the Bed Still Remembering First Love Bearing the Window Appointment</p>
<p>With a crash, the iron door opened. The military police rushed out from inside like wolves and tigers. Some opened fire, some swung clubs, some wielded knives, and some arrested people. They scattered the students in disarray, like chickens and ducks flying everywhere. Several were killed, and many more were injured. Many were also arrested. In addition, there were flags, leaflets, clubs, walking sticks, hats, scarves, magnetic boots, shoes, and other miscellaneous items scattered all over the ground. They only created a permanent April 27th Massacre to be commemorated. At this moment, Li Wenxia, as usual, served as the representative of the girls' school and was at the forefront. While others were turning around and running, she was still shouting angrily, telling everyone not to be afraid of death. Suddenly, a soldier chased after her and stabbed a female classmate next to her, causing several streams of bright red blood to spray out. She fearlessly sacrificed herself, rushing towards the beast-like soldier, trying to snatch the gun. Unexpectedly, the tip of the bayonet was already close to her eyebrows. As soon as she spoke, it was too late. That day, An Yutian also participated in the ranks. He glanced at her in danger, rushed to her rescue, and with a sudden step, he actually grabbed the gun in the middle. He just let the tip of the bayonet cut a two-inch wide opening under Li Wenxia's left shoulder socket. It did not pierce her chest. However, he did not expect that there was another policeman beside him, who raised the wooden support on the gun and hit him hard on the head. Immediately, he also broke his head and bled. Fortunately, he was physically strong. He endured this blow. Surprisingly, he did not faint. He calmed down slightly and used the martial arts he had practiced at home to deal with it. Suddenly, he loosened his hands and squatted down, throwing a sweeping leg. He actually tripped both the soldier and the policeman, who were caught off guard, to the ground. He dared not fight. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he helped Li Wenxia up and ran to a hospital to treat their wounds. They recuperated in the hospital for more than ten days. They sympathized with each other and comforted each other in their shared suffering. They met in the morning and evening, and their ears and temples rubbed against each other. As a result of their friendship in adversity, they formed a closer love. At that time, An Yutian was still tasting the taste of first love for the first time, and his enthusiasm was naturally fiery. Li Wenxia also wanted to have a place to rely on because of her lonely life experience. On a clear and bright night, they leaned together in front of a glass window on the upper floor of the hospital, pointing to the Milky Way in the sky, and quietly made a heartfelt marriage contract on the lips. However, An Yutian added another warning. They had to wait until he returned home to inform his parents and obtain their permission before they could announce it to the outside world. It was just that later, because there were bandits in his hometown, it was difficult to travel back early. An Yutian always lingered in Beijing and always kept this secret.</p>

<h3>The Achievements of the Investigation Team</h3>
<p>— Dragon</p>
<p>I originally believed that the dispatch of investigators by the League of Nations to the Northeast to investigate was meaningless. (1) There are no significant traces of war in the Northeast, or if there are, they have already been obliterated. (2) The organization and planning of the puppet Manchuria has been going on for a long time. It was originally a plan by the Japanese to shed their skin. (3) Japan's ambition to invade the Northeast is not only known to everyone, but also admitted in the Tanaka Memorial. Therefore, the dispatch of the League of Nations investigation team was originally considered a delaying and perfunctory measure by the League of Nations. Now that the investigation team has arrived in the Northeast, I dare not know what its final report will be. According to the recent newspapers, the lessons it has learned are as follows: (1) The London Munster Guidance newspaper editorial stated that the only function performed by the Lytton Investigation Team so far is to act as a forwarding agency for the Manchurian Japanese military authorities. The preliminary report of the investigation team is entirely based on information provided by the Japanese side. It can be directly sent to the League of Nations by Commander Honjo. Why should the investigation team take on this task? (2) The newspaper reported that on the 7th, a telegram from Beiping stated that Lytton was walking in the open space in front of the Yamato Hotel in Shenyang one day and suddenly saw four scouts monitoring him. Lytton was very unhappy. When a Chinese representative went to a bookstore to buy books about the Northeast incident, he was forced not to buy them. (3) A telegram from the Dentsu President in Changchun on the 7th stated that Gu Weijun, in view of the surrounding circumstances, which were unfavorable to him, agreed to remove the words "puppet country," etc., and would declare the removal in a self-initiated manner within two or three days. Observing the above three facts, the benefits of the League of Nations dispatching an investigation team are not seen, and its disadvantages are too numerous to mention. What is known now is like this. Let's see what the results will be later.</p>

<h3>Climbing Mount Tai with Feng Huanzhang</h3>
<p>— Li Liejun</p>
<p>Hand in hand, we climb to the peak of Dai, Taking in the vastness of the world below. From ancient times, whether wise or foolish, People's minds are disrupted by profit and gain. Gazing into the distance at the mountains and forests, One can only cherish a heart as cold as winter. Where else can grand schemes be found? What can comfort the blue-clothed populace? The rising sun illuminates thousands of mountains, With layered peaks reaching into the sky. Darkness cannot obstruct, The heavens themselves open the way. People are drunk, but I alone am awake, Choosing to live in seclusion away from others. How easy can feelings change throughout history? I find solace in a famous mountain.</p>
<h3>Hearing of Feng Huanzhang's Refusal of a Gift</h3>
<p>Ashamed to eat the millet of the Zhou family, How can a righteous person be insulted? This is not Shouyang Mountain, We are happy to provide a place for the virtuous.</p>
<h3>Inscribing on Chen Shuren's Painting of Pine Trees for Feng Huanzhang</h3>
<p>The flowing water and towering mountains are connected in a single vein, Floating clouds obscure the sun, just as they did in ancient times. In the cold of winter, one always knows one's exceptional character, There should be fragrance shared from beginning to end.</p>

<h3>Cement</h3>
<p>— Crown</p>
<p>When it comes to the use of cement, everyone knows it. In modern construction engineering, it is considered an indispensable raw material. So, to know how a country's material civilization is progressing, one can look at the amount of cement it consumes each year. Our country's first cement factory was as far back as the late Guangxu period. The first one was the Chinese-owned Qixin Company. Now there are six companies in total: Qixin, Huaji, Shimentu, Huashang, Zhongguo, and Zhijing. The annual output is about 3.26 million barrels. However, because our country's material civilization is gradually progressing, the demand is still more than this number, so we still rely on imports every year, amounting to more than 300,000 taels (customs taels). The Chinese name for cement is "Shuimen ting", which is a transliteration of the English word "Cement", also known as "Shuini". There are three types: Natural Cement, Portland Cement, and Puzzolanea. Natural cement is abundant in the United States and France, and volcanic ash is also abundant in Italy. However, most of the cement produced in the world belongs to the Portland type. The raw materials for cement manufacturing are gypsum, lime, and clay. The manufacturing methods are divided into two types: wet method and dry method. The wet method of manufacturing is easier than the dry method. The first step is to grind the raw materials into powder, mix them into a clay with appropriate ingredients, and then send them into a rotary kiln using air pressure for refining. The grains that are refined are then sequentially ground into fine powder using a machine to form the final product. As for the dry method, it seems to be more cumbersome than the wet method, because the raw materials must first be dried into fine powder, made into appropriate bricks, and then burned in various types of kilns (such as the Schnneider type and the Hoffmann type). The bricks that have been burned are then ground into fine powder to form the final product. The two manufacturing methods each have their advantages and disadvantages. However, if wetter raw materials are used, the dry method is better. If drier raw materials are used, the wet method is easier and more economical. As for the output of various countries, based on the average distribution of each country's population, the United States produces 1.46 barrels of cement per person, Belgium produces 2 barrels per person, Denmark produces 1 barrel per person, Norway produces 0.8 barrels per person, Germany produces 0.7 barrels per person, and Japan produces 131.6 pounds per person. Our country only has 3 pounds per person (the capacity of each barrel is usually 131.6 pounds). In contrast, the backwardness of our country's industry can be seen! In the end! The cement industry is indeed a basic industry of the country and is as important as the three acid industry. The former Prime Minister also discussed this in the National Construction Outline, which shows its importance.</p>

<h3>What I Saw in the Toilet</h3>
<p>— Si Ren</p>
<p>The toilet is the place for urination and defecation, and everyone knows this. Since the function of the toilet is like this, then what is there to say? Indeed, there is nothing to criticize about ordinary toilets, but the toilet in a dignified school has great research value! Especially the toilets in schools above the junior high level. The day before yesterday, I had an urgent bowel movement and didn't have time to go to my own room to defecate, so I went to the student toilet nearby to spend the lunch food bill that I had taken in. Just after I sat down, I looked up and saw the four walls were covered with pencil writing. Some belonged to love, some belonged to politics, some belonged to school, some belonged to ... They were beautiful and too numerous to be beheld, wonderfully indescribable. I have copied them haphazardly for your research and hope that young students will no longer engage in such pointless actions and engage in practical work, then this article can be said to be true. Jia Mis × I want you to come. Why don't you pay attention to me, what kind of airs are you putting on ... Yi Old brother, don't be silly, she already has a lover! Bing Woman is the most hateful thing, you poor life don't even think about it ... (The above belongs to love) ××××× Overthrow the ×× government, support ××× Overthrow the national traitors who do not resist, everyone prepare to fight the enemy (Author's note, are you going to fight while sitting on the toilet?) Oppose the Shanghai Compromise Agreement (The above belongs to politics) ×××××× Promote co-ed tables, open the gate ban, Training Teacher ××× Don't be so fierce ... (The above belongs to school) ××××××× Mr. Zhongqing ××× Don't be embarrassed, old brother, with the national crisis at hand, you are still wearing foreign clothes and leather shoes, are you also going to be a national traitor? Eating and defecating, defecating and eating, alternating non-stop, extremely troublesome (The above belongs to other categories)</p>

<h3>Sketches of Shanghai Four</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>The Sympathizer of the Mending Woman</p>
<p>It was a hot early summer afternoon. The city air was not enough for people to breathe. The surroundings of the small vegetable market were filled with the hot, steaming, tired, and unceasing heat. A woman in her forties, carrying her sorrowful face dotted with sweat stains and a basket containing rags and needles, was sitting close to the wall, waiting to mend clothes and socks for others. (Mend this bag for me, how much does it cost?) A small businessman was showing her his torn clothes. This was the opportunity she was sincerely hoping for now. (Whatever you give, sir!) He immediately took the needle and thread from his head, found a suitable piece of cloth, and carefully, stitch after stitch, began to mend. (How much do you make a day?) The employer asked, seemingly sincerely. (Ah! There's no business!) A trembling voice came from her throat. (Then is it enough to eat?) (It's just five or six large cakes ... and there are still children at home.) (Ah? That's really pitiful!) A touch of sympathy fell on her heart, which made her so grateful that tears streamed down her face. So she mended more carefully for him, and it was very firm. Soon, the clothes were mended, and she took a deep breath. Then she reached out to receive the wages she deserved. (Three copper coins? Sir!) This greatly disappointed her. (How much do you want? Isn't three copper coins enough?) He immediately put on a grimace. This was not acceptable no matter what. Even though he was already walking, she still had to shout after him. After that, she finally got one more. He thought ... (Ah! It's really impossible to expect them to pity me!)</p>

<h3>A Page from a Hospital Diary</h3>
<p>— Rui Huan</p>
<p>▲ Visiting the Wounded</p>
<p>In the dimly lit ward, most of the patients were lying down casually, except for one who was in better health, sitting on a rattan chair in the room, wearing a strange hat.  It was evening, and dinner had already been eaten.  At that moment, three modern ladies walked in. Everyone knew at a glance that they were there to visit the wounded, because everyone recognized that they had been there several times before.  One of them, with a happy look, pointed to the patient sitting in the rattan chair and said to her companions, (Look! Isn't he the one whose brain was damaged? That one sitting there, wearing a hat.)  The patient, upon hearing this, jumped up from the chair and cursed, (Good! What nonsense are you spouting? If my brain was damaged, would I still be able to sit here? Are you blind? Aren't you the one suffering from a nervous breakdown? You shameless hussies, what do you mean by visiting the wounded? Aren't you just here to see the spectacle?) And he continued to curse... (Relying on being rich, having nothing better to do than gorge yourselves, and still that's not enough. Covering your faces with rouge, wearing high-heeled leather shoes, coming out to wander around and show off your ugliness. Shanghai has become such a corrupt world precisely because of people like you! You hussies! You are truly misleading people.  And what is this time? You still come here, what are you trying to do? Don't you know the rules of the hospital? Visiting hours are from 2 to 4 o'clock, what time is it now!  Miss (referring to the nurse)! What time is it now? How did you let these hussies in? Hurry up and kick them out, aren't you trying to kill us?)  The more vigorously he cursed, the more they lowered their heads, filled with shame and not knowing what to do.  Fortunately, the nurse heard the cursing and quickly came over to lead them out, bringing the scene to a close.  As for the rest of the crowd, they just burst into laughter.  | Recorded at X Hospital, || An ode to Shanghai, Old Tang, on a summer night, at a corner in the XX bar.</p>
<p>Drunkenly Dreaming of Death</p>
<h3>An Ode to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Old Tang</p>
<p>Here are three people...a lawyer, a real estate developer, and a dancer from a dance hall. In the waves of music, in the intoxication of alcohol, in the fragrance of snow cream and Stenco, each filled their own cup, each praising Shanghai, the city that never sleeps.  A strand of gentle, soul-stirring voice emanated from the dancer's pearly throat and cherry lips... (Beautiful, Shanghai! Here there are flickering shadows, quivering bodies, and the tinkling of music. Come! Shake our heels, we press close to each other, rubbing our breasts! Look! The lights are dim. The waists are exquisite. We want to be the darlings of the 20th century, the masters of Shanghai, the city that never sleeps!)  (Look! This map is Shanghai, the city that never sleeps.) The real estate developer opened the map of Shanghai in his hand and said this... (This is Nanjing Road, and over there is the Bund. Decades ago, this place was still piles of tombs and hills. This is Jiangwan, the future city center. In the near future, what is now worth a thousand yuan will rise to tens of thousands! How worthwhile it is, investing in real estate!)  Finally, the lawyer opened the (talking box) mechanism, and shouted triumphantly, as if arguing in court... (Wait! Is the greatness of Shanghai just what you people say? Quick! Open your newspapers! Here is divorce, here is rape, densely filling this page. In Shanghai, if you don't hire a permanent legal advisor, you'll become a weakling under someone's crotch! This kind of feature is what makes Shanghai the city that never sleeps.)</p>
<p>The Complexion Problem</p>
<h3>A Primary School Teacher</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from my home, asking me for twenty dollars to maintain their livelihood, and asking me to send it back immediately.  Originally, I had to send back at least ten dollars a month to my family, otherwise, they simply couldn't survive.  I am a primary school teacher, sitting on a cold bench, eating chalk dust, claiming to be sacred. My monthly salary was originally twenty-some dollars. Apart from six or seven dollars for food and three or four dollars for miscellaneous expenses, I could still have more than ten dollars a month.  But now, it's no longer possible. Since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, everything, everything has embraced a tight policy. Those who make a living in education, of course, cannot be an exception. They only give out some maintenance fees each month, nominally maintenance fees, but they can't even maintain one person's life (according to the current standard of living). How can I have money to send back? Although it's been almost three months since the school started, letters asking for money from home have come one after another, and they are written with great urgency. What can I do? If I talk to the principal, the principal will also say there is no way. If I go to borrow from friends, my friends are suffering the same illness as me. It's over! What else can I do?  Ah! What will I, a sacred primary school teacher who relies on teaching to eat, do? After receiving the letter asking for money from my home!  A burst of thunder, and then a torrential rain fell. Everything before my eyes felt even darker.</p>

<h3>Morris's Amazing Performance (Continued)</h3>
<p>Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>▲New Style Fenders The construction method of the fenders is also completely new. The raw material is pure steel. On the jumps, the concavity of the surface has been changed to several small clips for holding objects and miscellaneous tools. Coil ignition is used instead of a magneto, and all the tools are completely new. The coil is quite clean, similar to a magneto. Although the frame has been lowered, the center of the vehicle is still manufactured with great care to prevent accidental friction. One end is the exhaust pipe, like an electromagnet, protruding to the side. Due to the innovation of the frame, the front springs of the new car are tightly connected to the front end. It is a minor detail, but it is interesting and worth exploring. The new car's radiator is also quite large in form and is placed at the point of combustion. Passing through the connecting rod, the head of the radiator is unusually strong, and its position is quite appropriate, truly achieving perfection.</p>
<p>▲Overview of New 1932 Morris Minor and Major Cars The steering wheels of the 1932 Morris Minor and Major cars are all located in the center. The ignition switch, light switch, and horn are all in the center for easy operation. The most popular open cars come in five types. Two-seater vehicles also have seating for two in the driving area. A slanted coupe has a luggage rack. There are two doors. A fixed sedan has four doors and six lights. There is also a slanted-front sedan. The added colors</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>come in three types for customers to choose from. Blue imitation ivory with brown Bernhard attachments, brown imitation ivory with brown attachments. There is also a new type of car, an open touring car. The chassis of the Morris new car is mostly equipped with this type of vehicle. The novelty of its style is most noteworthy, and it is most satisfying for those who want to buy a beautiful car, as the added colors are quite beautiful. The touring coupe used for touring has a slanted front and two doors. Each door has two windows, not one, which can be operated independently. There are two glass windows on the roof to replace ventilators, so the air in the car can circulate even when the windows are closed tightly. The front seats are placed separately and can be moved. The rear has various attachments placed in it. The legroom in the car is quite spacious, and there is a luggage rack at the rear of the car for carrying passengers' luggage or miscellaneous items.</p>
<p>▲Large Six-Cylinder New Car The Morris six-cylinder car is the most economical, and the number of reforms is the most numerous. The reform of the engine is the most obvious. The horsepower is below 14, as specified by the British car tax. The engine horsepower of this type of vehicle is limited to 15. The new engine's cylinders are 61.25 x 102MM (1.803CC), while the 1931 model was 63.5 x 102MM (1938CC). Therefore, the new engine's horsepower is 13.9, and the annual tax is only 14 pounds. The frame has been completely renovated from top to bottom. The wheel track has been lengthened to 4 feet 4 inches in the arc-shaped axle, replacing the old 4 feet. The form of the new frame is also larger than the old one, so it is more solid. The body is also much wider, so the sedan can seat five people. The fuel tank is located at the rear and holds 5 gallons of gasoline. It is strictly protected to prevent accidents. In addition, there is a point of reform that is very noteworthy, namely the four-part transmission. The third gear row operates without sound, or on a three-part transmission, the upper gear row can be shifted simultaneously. Because of this transmission, sliding is quite convenient. The side of the gasoline tank has a small rod that can be immersed in the oil to probe the oil level. The radiator is completely new and has automatic louvers to work with it. There is also a centrifugal water pump and a huge fan to maintain the engine temperature. In terms of construction, there is also a significant advance, namely, the support for placing the engine crosses the frame, and the front bearings are placed on it. The bearings at the rear end have an additional bearing in an arc shape. This major reform is enough to give the new car special results and make it a successful product for 1932.</p>
<p>▲Style of Coupe The Morris factory produces five types of popular coupes on the market. One is a five-seater open car, one is a two-seater, four-light, slanted-front sedan, a two-purpose car with a luggage rack, one is a fixed-front sedan with four doors and six lights, one is a slanted-front sedan, and one is a touring car.</p>
<p>▲Large Six-Cylinder New Car Among the various new Morris cars in 1932, the most noteworthy is the large six-cylinder new car, which has a beautiful and smooth form and is fast and beautiful on the road. This new car is not only easy to drive, but also quite comfortable. As for the construction, there are countless improvements. The main point is that the transmission has been changed from three-part to four-part, and the top two gears can be used simultaneously. The third gear row operates without sound. The frame is also completely new, and because many transverse iron pipes have been added to the axle, it is very solid. Many iron pipes have also been added under the engine to connect it tightly to the frame. The rear engine bearings are also connected to each other. The new clutch is shaped like a single piece and is lubricated by injecting oil from the plug. The new car's reforms also imitated the Ises car. The front springs are completely the same. The front spring hooks are no different from other new cars and are located at the frontmost part, while the other side is at the rearmost part and is equipped with spring shock absorbers. In this case, the car can emit a shimmering light while driving and there is no danger of bumps. Among the new cars, the most popular coupe has three types. One is a four-door, six-light sedan with a slightly slanted head and a very comfortable driver's seat. The windows have glass vents. The rear seats have headrests and other innovations. The bumper uses double bars, and the radiator shutter, horn, light switch, etc. are all available. One is a two-door, four-light sports car. The windows and front of the car are slightly slanted. There is a luggage compartment at the rear, and the two-door slanted-head touring car of the six-cylinder Major car is particularly famous for a while, and the exquisite interior decoration of the specially equipped chassis is unmatched by other new cars.</p>
<p>▲Colors Painted on New Cars The colors painted on various new cars are mostly blue and black, and all accessories are brown, or wine red and black with brown accessories. As for touring cars, in addition to the above colors, there are also off-white and dove gray with blue accessories for the car owner to choose from. The largest new car is the Ises six-cylinder, which is known for its particularly smooth engine operation. The new frame is even lower, the gears are divided into four parts, the third gear row is silent, and the wheelbase is ten feet, replacing the old nine feet six inches. The front springs are the same as the Major car, connected to the frontmost end. The Ises car also has a huge oil tank that can hold 17 gallons of gasoline. The completely renovated car body includes a sedan and a touring car. The sedan is a four-door, six-light car for seven people with a slanted head and a new radiator. The wings have been improved, and the covers are completely new, so the beauty of the appearance is unmatched. As for the construction of the touring car, the situation is as described above, and it is also a worthy Ises new car. To save space, it will not be described separately. Discussion</p>
<h3>Automobile Safety Issues Huang Yingdai</h3>
<p>The automobile, although a convenient means of transportation, is more prone to accidents and kills more people than any other means of transportation. Therefore, every driver takes the issue of safety as the main priority when driving. However, after a practical test, it is difficult to ensure safety while driving. If one can pay attention to safety issues at any time when driving out, then there is nothing for us to criticize. If one drives without paying attention to safety and an accident occurs, the authorities can convict them of a crime. Recently, various automobile factories have been making every effort to pay attention to safety issues, such as powerful brakes, bright headlights, and the supply of other safety equipment when driving in crowded cities, all with the aim of reducing accident events. In fact, however, automobile accidents and deaths are still increasing day by day.</p>
<p>To avoid automobile accidents, there is an extremely convenient method that any driver can implement. What is that method? It is to pay attention to safety issues at any time and in any place when driving. If everyone can pay attention to the direction of travel while driving, all kinds of disasters can be eliminated to the smallest possible extent. In addition, there is another matter, which is pedestrians. Automobile accidents and deaths are not necessarily caused by the driver's negligence. Some pedestrians may not pay attention and be run over by cars. Therefore, to avoid automobile accidents, the responsibility should be shared equally by the driver and the pedestrian. If pedestrians can pay attention to the traffic and not enter the traffic lanes, various disasters will inevitably be reduced.</p>
<p>The important causes of automobile accidents are the driver's negligence, excessive speed, lack of driving skills, and unfamiliarity with traffic lights and signs. On plateau roads, although they are wide and relatively convenient, automobile manufacturers have recently been using the highest speeds. However, excessive speed should be avoided if possible, and should not be accelerated arbitrarily. Therefore, cautious people will not want to drive too fast while driving, as excessive speed can cause all kinds of disasters. Driving and accelerating arbitrarily is tantamount to rejoicing in misfortune.</p>
<p>To avoid accidents while driving, there are many methods that cannot be fully described in writing. When driving on the road, one should always pay attention to whether the various components of the car are reliable. This is the main thing, and then use one's skillful operations to keep the speed at a moderate level and be vigilant against the occurrence of disasters at all times. For example, when a driver is driving forward and cannot carefully observe objects around or at the corners of the road, they should sound the horn or stop temporarily. Special attention should be paid to intersections, and the speed should be reduced when turning. In addition, there are many methods of avoiding disasters that cannot be fully described to the reader. It depends on the driver's adaptability. News</p>

<h3>New Automobile Repair Machines Purchased</h3>
<p>The American-owned China Motors Corporation on Bubbling Well Road. The Chinese General Manager, Mr. Zhou Mengxian, in view of the intense competition among various automobile companies in Shanghai in recent years, specially cabled Mr. Feilimen, the foreign General Manager who was inspecting automobile businesses in Europe and America, to purchase new automobile repair machines locally. Such as spray painting machines, tire repair machines, automatic loading and unloading machines, automatic refueling machines, and generators, pressure machines, etc. All kinds of novel machines recently invented in Europe and America have been completely purchased. The original building will also be rebuilt to accommodate these machines. It is expected that when the project is completed in the future, the quality and speed of its products will be unparalleled. This is not only convenient for repairs, but also able to manufacture parts that cannot be purchased in Shanghai. A batch of these machines arrived in Shanghai last month, and the rest are being rushed to be installed day and night. Mr. Feilimen, the general manager of the company, will also accompany them to Shanghai in the near future.</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Actively Building Roads</h3>
<p>▲ Jin Shuren reports to the Road Association of the China National Road Construction Association. Previously, due to frequent foreign invasions, it was urgent to build roads to defend against the enemy and save the country. A special letter was sent to the provincial and municipal governments to quickly build roads to facilitate transportation. Replies were received one after another, and they are all under construction. Recently, another letter was received from Jin Shuren, Chairman of Xinjiang, reporting on the road conditions in the province, which require approximately 1 million yuan. In the future, the journey from Dihua to Suiyuan will only take 13 days, eliminating the rugged detour through Siberia. The original letters are recorded below to give a glimpse. Jin Shuren's letter to the Road Association stated: ((Above omitted) Xinjiang is isolated in the frontier and separated from the interior. It takes several months to travel from Lanzhou to the capital or other prosperous areas. In case of sudden changes, the deadline cannot be determined. Although it is faster to pass through Siberia, it takes more than a month to arrive, and the restrictions are extremely strict and there are many difficulties. It is impossible to take this long journey unless it is absolutely necessary. Shuren now plans to open a long-distance route from Dihua to Suiyuan. It is flat and straight, which is far better than the previous two routes. If it can be smooth, there will be great benefits in terms of transportation and economy. There is a definite certainty. However, the start-up cost requires approximately 1 million yuan in current silver dollars. We are now trying our best to raise funds in order to implement it quickly. (Below omitted)) The Road Association replied: ((Above omitted) Upon reading your special letter, we are delighted to learn that your province is opening a long-distance bus station from Dihua to Suiyuan, which can be reached in only 13 days. In the future, it will be unobstructed, and there will be great benefits in terms of transportation and economy. There is a definite certainty. The success is immediate, and the benefits will last for generations. Your Excellency's construction achievements are truly no less than those of Dayu. After listening to this, we are deeply pleased. Please send the various plan books, charts, photos, and descriptions of the entire road to this association at any time so that they can be published in the Road Monthly, so that people across the country can understand the real achievements of your province's road construction (Below omitted)) and so on.</p>
<h3>Xiang Sheng's Sixth Branch</h3>
<p>Opening News: Xiang Sheng Automobile Company specializes in the rental car business, providing attentive service and enjoying prosperous business.

<h3>Standard Automobiles Sell Well</h3>
<p>According to Standard Motor Company, Standard car sales in March of this year have already broken the company's all-time sales record. Progress is being made day by day and month by month. This is a clear testament to the company's prosperous business. As for the increasing number of Standard vehicles traveling on the road, it is even more evident that they are warmly welcomed by the world. At a time when all industries are declining and the world economy is in recession, it is rare and gratifying to achieve such results. What is particularly commendable is that the manufacturer has a unique vision and carefully manufactures vehicles that are well-suited to the needs and scope of the modern economic situation.</p>
<h3>Graham's New Station Launched</h3>
<p>The 1932 Graham eight-cylinder new car has now been released. Its structure and design are precisely adapted to the current economic situation. The wheelbase is 123 inches, but it looks longer and larger in form. All kinds of car bodies are extremely magnificent and moving. The eight-cylinder engine has 90 horsepower.
