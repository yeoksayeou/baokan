<p>時評</p>
<h3>德國之民族主義與反資本主義翰。</h3>
<p>我人於德國政情。已屢爲文論之。蓋德國政治爲解决歐洲政治謎之鑰匙。使我人不得不再三注意者也。自德國巴本内閣成立以來。希特勒之勢力。馳騁於國内。賴債之呼聲。磅薄於國外。物不平則鳴。此種新興勢力之崛起。必爲某種環境所釀成。予嘗閉目靜思猶未得其詳。今見德國佛郎福大學敎授亨利德孟近著［德國之新民族主義］講稿。分析至爲清楚。爰譯其義。以供留心世界問題者之參考。</p>
<p>自羅加諾條約簽訂以後。德加盟日内瓦史脱萊斯孟乘機周旋於諸强之間。不再以戰敗國自居。道威斯計劃。旣爲楊格計劃所代。萊因區域之駐軍。亦陸續徹退。在此種客觀條件之下。德民族主義之高潮。似宜退落。乃希特勒所領袖之民族運動。反繼長增高此何故耶</p>
<p>夫現代政黨。均有階級之基礎。欲明希特勒勢力之階級基礎爲何。當先知德國階級分化之内容。德國之反抗階級。大别之可分爲三。一部份工人受機器發達之影響。排擠傾軋。流於失業。形成無産階級之下層。爲共産黨作淵藪。此其一也。機器之發達。一方面排擠一部份之手藝工人。他方面亦能提高一部份工人之生活。形成無産階級之上層結爲社會民主黨之核心。此其二也都市中之小資産階級小市民。以及農村中之自耕農。或則受戰後經濟之打擊。産業合理化運動之驅策。或則受企業家之支配。過勞工不若之生活。或則受資本主義之操縱。農村利息之抬高。農村經濟。日益凋蔽。不期然而然。同集於反資本主義之旗幟下。形成希特勒勢力之組織。</p>
<p>共産黨社會民主黨以及希特勒所領袖之國社黨。斯三黨者。乃德國反資本主義之三種不同形式也。共産黨爲革命的反資本主義。社會民主黨爲改良的反資本主義。而希特勒所領袖之國社黨。則爲民族的反資本主義。同爲反資本主義。而民族的反資本主義之高潮竟能超出一切。此其故當求於外。　　德國之悲哀。爲近世所稀有。凡爾賽和約之不允修正。使德國始終蒙大戰戎首之惡名。楊格計劃之成立。絕不足以減輕德國向協約賠償之重累。而債務之清償。其期遠在一九八八年。德國人民之子若孫。以及於曾孫。均將分担此一筆重債。使德國人民皆感覺德國悲哀之根因。不僅在内。抑且在外。希特勒以内抗猶太外抗强權之口號。深鐫入於無産化的小資産階級。小市民與農民之心髓。使反資本主義與民族主義日益接近。而結成民族的反資本主義。其勢力之擴大。一日千里皆客觀環境有以致之也。</p>
<p>且也德之東鄰蘇聯。十年以還艱苦締造。脱離戰後歐洲關係之覊絆。一筆勾銷帝俄時代之債務。人方受經濟恐慌之厄運。而俄反高唱五年計劃之成功。此種特殊的奮鬥精神。實爲日在痛苦中之德人所嘖羡。民族的布爾雪維克運動。旣適合被壓迫人民胃口。則希特勒勢力之突起。亦時勢所造成者也。　　惟此種民族的反資本主義之運動。其意義不在反對資本主義之本身。而在反抗階級自身不甘於無産化之厄運。故運動之性質爲情感的。而非理智的。爲一種自然之衝動。而非文化之進程。爲神秘的而非科學的。爲象徵思想之顯露。而非邏輯觀念之演進。爲革命的。同時亦爲反革命的。其所掀起者將爲國際政治之絕大曲折。與世界文化之絕大波瀾。近方召集之洛桑會議。苟不能爲德國留一線生機。則德國之民族的反資本主義。必將鋌而走險。而歐洲局面之潰决。勢且波及世界。將與東亞方亟之風雲。如電流之激盪而接觸。則世界之前途。尙堪設想乎。</p>

<p>我們在酒席上所談的第二個問題便是招學生·宋老太問朱先生預備收多少人。朱先生說··［一個也可，一千也可。］宋老太說··［要上學的學生多着咧我只怕收不下朱先生連一千也能收那就不必我們煩心了］春生哥問··［幾歲的孩子就可以上學呢？］朱先生說··［一歲也可百歲可。］大家都笑了起來，說··［照這様講，我們都可以做學生了。那好。］李司務問··［有許多孩子想來而不得來又有什麽辦法？比如住在我隔壁的牛兒，靠守牛吃飯。他想進學堂簡直是如同害了相思病一樣。但是進學堂就没得飯吃，要吃飯就不能進學堂，先生看，像牛兒這樣的孩子是有許多，怎麽辦呢？比如我老李雖然是虛度了四十歲，也想認識幾個字，但總不能關了舖子去求學吧。因爲關了舖子就要餓了肚子，當了褲子，這决不是好玩的。（大家哄堂而笑）先生看，如何是好？］朱先生說··［有辦法。與其招學生進校不如送敎育上門。我們把敎育送上牛背，不是不可能。如果您不見棄，我們也可以拿點敎育的禮物來送送您。］李司務聽得高興極了，大家都說這法子好。</p>

<h3>花粉店老闆的頌聲</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>大槪在二十餘年前吧。這時候的女學校，恰才萌芽·，一做了女學生，便有一種質樸的青示；隨意挽一個風凉　兒，不須膏沐，不須插戴；衣服是屏去綺羅的；尤其是只重本色，不御鉛華。所以，當時的女學生，在那無知無識的時髦婦女眼光中看來，只說這是一隊小老太婆！</p>
<p>女學生趨重小老太婆化，便和花粉店老闆有了敵對行爲，重重的施以打擊！曾記得有一位花粉店老闆，向我皺着眉頭說··</p>
<p>丨女學校一天天的發達，我們吃化妝品飯的，一天天的受着影響！只怕十年以後，花粉店都要關門大吉；二十年以後，化妝品三字，要成爲歷史上的名詞了！</p>
<p>誰料，大謬不然！二十年以後，這们老闆先生，財運亨通，利市三倍；他所開的花粉店，大小共有三處；每處的營業，都是不惡。他向我堆着笑臉說··丨二十年來敎育進步，化妝品的營業，也隨同進步。不但，以化妝品爲生命的女學生，都成了敝業的老主顧；便是一般男學生，也比從前愛好的多了；史丹康和雪花粉，比着敎科書和敎育用品尤爲重要！所以，敝業便蒸蒸日上了！男女學生，都是敝業的衣食父母！敎育萬歲！男女學生萬歲！</p>
<p>我聽了，便起着一種疑問··</p>
<p>丨化妝品的營業，固然進步了，敎育究竟進步没有？花粉店老闆的衣食父母，快給我下一斷語來！</p>
<h3>戰後的復旦</h3>
<p>— 吳承達</p>
<p>戰後的曁大。有人說過了。我來一說我們的復旦吧。</p>
<p>復量大學前臨翔殷路。後沿葉市路。大厦很多。有［子彬院］［簡公堂］［仙舟圖書館］及男女宿舍數十幢。這次日軍佔得江灣。便據該校爲司令部。所以不曾遭砲火之刦。也是不幸中之大幸。</p>
<p>但是各室的零件。都被搗毁了。尤推該校辦公廳的子彬院。椅桌板壁。無一完好。仙舟圖書館的重要圖書。幸早携出。僅損窗沿。</p>
<p>此次學生損失最鉅。僅西裝及書籍兩項。已屬不貲。某粤生一人竟損失二千餘元。更爲驚人。良友及校内宿舍内。均無一物遺存。祇意敦宿舍因離校較遠。未遭罹刦。殆亦有幸有不幸歟。</p>
<p>東宮（女生宿舍）　無一人。雙扉緊閉。臥室幔簾。多已破舊以視昔日之富麗堂皇。大有［此一時也彼一時也］之慨。</p>
<p>前後大門。駐有警察。以資保護。出入頗嚴。</p>
<p>從跑馬廳到該校。原有固定價目（每次銅元十二枚）之黄包車百餘輛。現以交通未獲完全復原。車輛絕跡。往該校者多駕汽車云。</p>
<h3>談談店招</h3>
<p>— 徐本熙</p>
<p>店招。廣義點說；大約是這樣的·因爲開店的目標在牟利。而營業的動機又是發財·所以·店招的取義，便脫不了［利］［發］［盛］［順］······這麽幾個字的範圍·至於什麽［營業的眞實］和［待客的圓轉］，那末，只是有［男女］［貴賤］之别而分的，並不能一槪而論。　　在上海，也許民衆思想的達觀，和精神文明的普及，在現時代下已稍稍改變形式，而趨向於摩登化·所以我們能夠於馬路上稍加留意的話，大槪可以看到比較新奇有趣的店招，引人竚觀，而廣招徠。</p>
<p>小西門，最近開了一家點心店，取名［一二八］·據我看來，很藴含着深意·因爲［一二八］就根本成爲一個紀念日，而［一二八］所昭示的事實，又是刻不可忘的印像·這爿店是點心店，意義就是說··進裏面吃點心的人，都應［點］着［一二八］這日的［心］的活躍，而不能淡忘·可是有［一二八］，不免應有［九一八］，不知己開未？</p>
<p>西門也有小食店名［津津］，購咖哩牛肉湯極有名·［津津］這二字，不但玲瓏小巧，同時因着［津津］，不免進去嘗嘗［有味］的東西。</p>
<p>［四五六］，［清一色］，義近賭，未免落伍，以［摩登］爲店招的，却風起雲湧，而［桃花宮］，有位常去的朋友說，頗含詩意，姑妄聽之。</p>
<p>店招最短的是公館馬路一家鹹貨號，單名［興］，最長的我並未發現。</p>
<p>在大西路上，有一爿不知售什麽的小店，名其店曰［包關店］，聽說店主並不希望能發達，然而幾年來，也並没關。　　可供一粲的還很多，這僅僅是最小的一部份。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>東北淪亡了整足九個月，我人爲了［國難］而做［救國］的宣傳工作，到如今只喚起了一部分沉醉的民衆，而東省依然在日人盤據之下，長此因循，憑你怎麽枉費心思，也無濟於事；惟有［鐵血］主義，才是救國的眞詮。東北數址萬義勇軍，長期苦戰到現在，雖不曾把我們的生命線立刻規復，然而敵人已覺疲於奔命了。此際倘如全國一德一心的實行（一）政府準備精兵十萬，相機出關，外攻内應；（二）民衆繼續捐輸，集中物質與精神上的援助；敢斷定本年的九一八紀念，我們可以在瀋陽，長春，龍江等處，痛飲葡萄，高唱勝利之歌！</p>
<p>廬山數度會議，據說對東北已有收回的討劃，計劃内容是什麽？却仍是［一面外交，一面抵抗］的濫調。唉！外交是一籌莫展，抵抗是義軍自動的抵抗，政府不發一彈一卒，怎能說是抵抗？國聯九月大會，如其再存着［希望］，結果一定是［夢想］；總之［收復東北］，除了［武力］，别無可通的途徑！</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>▲英國赫特斯菲Huddersfield地方的公共汽車。在任何一國的公共汽車中首屈一指。車中用香料薫過。芬芳撲鼻。使一般奔波塵沙中的市民跨進車門之後。得到片刻的慰安。</p>
<p>▲自安全剃刀盛行以後。人人都可自己修面去髭。不必假手於理髮匠。致使理髮匠常有失業的危險。巨古斯拉夫Yugoslavia國的理髪匠有鑒於此。呈請國家取締私人所用的安全剃刀以及普通剃刀。凡有剃刀的人。必須領取執照。與自備槍械同。</p>
<p>▲英國近來也流行日光浴。海濱游樂塲已有三十五處之多。那邊特許男子們只穿襯衣襯褲。躺在海灘上作日光浴。内中九處還是今年新設立的。</p>
<p>▲英國斯太夫Ｓtaffs地方一家磁器廠中。在工作時間用留聲機奏爵士音樂。據說可使工人們得精神的安慰。而勤於工作。出品也因此遞加。</p>
<h3>談電器</h3>
<p>— 楓崖</p>
<p>文明愈進步。電氣事業愈發達。歐美各先進國。固不必論。彼新興之日本。近來蠶絲業亦日趨電氣化。故能絲質精良。且産量豐富。我國絲業之海外貿易。幾全爲攘奪。此固彼國人之苦心研究。但亦電氣之助其發展也。</p>
<p>我國電氣事業。年來已大見發達。一觀海關華洋貿易册。民國十五年。電氣材料及機器之進口總値。爲關平銀一千萬兩。以後年有增加。至十八年。則爲數已達一千六百三十一萬兩。再查德國實業考察團對於中國電氣事業之報告書。首稱。考查中國全國進口貨物總數。德國佔百分之三·九。其中百分之十一·五爲電料。日本佔百分之三十三。英·美兩國。不過佔百分之十六·或十七。云云。是我國電氣事業愈發達。即間接增高外國電器銷華之數量。誠堪浩歎。故製造電器。實爲當今之急務。</p>
<p>查國人自製電器之工廠。已有數家。如益中專製磁夾板·及方棚。永豐專製手電筒。復須專製電氣熨斗。亞浦耳·華生·克來生·等。或製燈泡。或製風扇。因限於篇幅。未能詳述。茲姑舉其中規模最大。出品最多之亞浦耳廠而述其梗槪。爲國人告。該廠初係德人名［亞浦耳］者所創辦。專製電燈泡。後由華人盤受。加以擴充。兼製電風扇·電火爐·及馬達等。總廠在虹口遼陽路。製造電燈泡·及燈泡所必需之玻璃物件。分廠在楊樹浦鄱陽路。製造電風扇·電火爐·及馬達等。總經理胡西園君。頭腦清新。富於毅力。故出品日精。遠銷國内各行省及南洋羣島。電燈泡·有長絲·可樂·氬氣·裏磨砂·半磨砂·顔色泡等。咸光亮耐久。電風扇·有十二寸·十四寸·十六寸·等搖頭檯扇。及三十六寸·五十六寸·四翼吊扇。電火爐·有方形·圓形二種。均式樣美觀。經久耐用。馬達·自四分之一匹·至二匹。馬力充足。應用自如。胡君復鑒於國人之需要電器者日繁。深虞出品有供不應求之勢。正計劃添置最新式之機器。使各種電器。産量增加。隨時可以供給鉅量之需要。將來亞浦耳廠對於國人之供獻。定未可限量也。</p>
<h3>故都見聞錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>▲炕</p>
<p>京西諸山煤礦豐衍。即以土法開掘。亦可獲利。北地苦寒。常以孟冬之朔。至仲春之晦。爲然爐之季。近年氣候益變。甚至陰曆九月中旬已非煴火不可。民國十九年重九日即已霏雪。苟非取煤尙易何堪設想也。土人取煤而屑之。和以黄土。暴乾爲丸。號曰煤球。以白泥作罏。然之於户外。俟其熾盛。移入室中。其上可以煮湯粥。煎茗藥。富家則飾以銅具。往時無西式火鑪大都用此。惟不善用者易觸煤毒爲可虞。至於内廷府邸。高堂大厦。非區區一鑪所能致暖。則有地炕。地炕者。穴地累磚。有似窟室。然煤其中。温氣自然四達。此爲古代遺制。水經注已語及之。平民之居。無此工程。僅於臥起之處爲　炕以取煖而已。北人居處多就南牖爲炕。冬日可以直射。富厚之家亦不設木榻。唯炕上多施氈　之屬。亦差能適體。日間衾褥卷而藏之。至夜方設。此蓋亦古風。古以施之地上爲不同耳。今日本人如此。正吾漢制也。炕旣寬大。常可並臥數人。以足抵牖。綽有餘裕。日間設矮几於上。即可觀書作字炕上置書。不似几案之狹小動輒礙肘也。清代帝皇召見臣工即御炕。乾清宮東西暖閣猶存其式。華茵隱囊。想見坐起之適。今舊屋經南人入而居之者多已廢炕。不知此物宜於北方。不可廢也。歐人旅居北都者。轉喜其式。常願保存之。獨炕中然火。南人初至北方。不宣輕試。恒有因臥炕而致得春温症者。蓋不堪其燥烈耳。北方貧户尤非此不可。彼旣無力製床榻。又環堵之室。即有床榻亦無所施。且嚴冬漫漫。無火亦不能度日。惟居炕則旣可省地。又可省煤。一家男婦老幼。縱列而臥。酣寢達旦男子旣出。婦人可從　中喚賣食物者買而食之。可竟日足不履地。若山西之俗。婦人好纒纖足。至不能自勝其軀。竞至終年不離炕。此種惡風。足以弱種。北都旗婦本不纒足。即漢婦近亦多解放。幸不至此也。炕字見契丹國志。其稱已古。特南方未嘗有耳。</p>

<p>只是方桌旁擺着一張藤織的大躺椅。有一位團頭大臉脂肪豐富的黑胖子。敞開了當胸一排軍衣鈕扣。翹起左腿上隻裝配着赤金馬剌輪的黄皮長統靴。正很擺格很納福的仰臥在那上面閉着睛眼養神。乍聽見毛德順那様一呌。只勉强睜着一雙紅絲纏繞的眼珠子。迷迷矇矇向來人望着。并不肯立時就紆尊降貴的站起來。失了他當上校處長的大身分。倒敎安玉田仍只好必恭必敬的在門邊演習立正的姿勢。且趁此偷眼再向室中細細瀏覽。又發見有一張床上睡着個仰面朝天張嘴打鼾形狀兒最可恐怖的人。正是昨天侮辱他的那位承啓官。這種人便是睡着了。也還不肯將好臉子給人看。後來還是毛德順哈着腰走近藤椅邊。亮出安玉田的名片請萬處長鼠目一觀。又特指着安玉田本人介紹道。安參議來向處長請安啦。萬金生方才如大夢初醒一般。視聽二器官回復了平常的效用。哦的一聲。辨不分明是呵欠還是歡呼。緊接着就抬起他那肥重的身體來。伸開手拍了安玉田一下肩膀。似鴟鳥般呷呷聲怪笑道。老弟。不是我這做大哥的初見面就敢說你。你實是太不對了。你旣是與八小姐同床共被那様恩愛親密的人。想當年我與頭兒跟車每到八小姐那地方去。頭兒在裏面擺酒請客。我同幾個弟兄和開車的在外邊賬房間推小牌九。每每輸亟了。向八小姐借個一百八十的。從没有個回駁。眞敎我如今還常念着伊的好處呢。昨天你小兄弟來了。幹嗎不先來找我反話說穿。以致我處裏的人不知道。多有怠慢。還是毛德顺剛才來報告我。我才清楚。可是事情已經弄糟啦。萬一八小姐不明白這裏面是有隔閡。疑惑我這個人就這樣不講面子。從前領伊那許多情。半點都没曾補報得。現在對你這個小兄弟。又還看做外人不肯照應。我這還夠朋友嗎。誰知我正爲聽得這信息十分難過。偏偏你和八小姐又還那般客氣。另呌毛德順送了兩張支票來。這就更糟得厲害。好像認準了我是個不講交情只重錢財的小人。敎我如何受得下去。</p>

<h3>上週紗市暴落</h3>
<p>▲人標跌四兩</p>
<p>▲現紗小二兩</p>
<p>棉紗市况、在上週間直趨下游、蓋以世界潮流險惡、物價一落千丈、兼之國内經濟破産、農村衰敗、人民生計日蹙、以致棉紗實銷停滯、需求凋疲、至於日商因原料廉宜、在四方侵銷、華北一路早已無望、本紗受其打擊、至重且大、故華紗有數廠囤貨、日漸增加、華紗銷路最大之南埠、亦以政潮不寗、金融奇緊、發展力殊薄祇有滇桂粤蜀等處時有十支粗紗交易、然胃量亦不大、其他帮口如長江被日商佔據、漢口各廠亦有存貨之說、閩贛共禍猖獗、鄂豫匪患、蔓延愈甚瞻顧四園情形、滿目凄凉、商業何能發展也、有此重大原因、標紗市况遂發現暴落、一時大有不可收拾之槪、但申地有一般棉紗商、以爲二十支標紗已屬低盤、購進心思較濃、然一視世界物價程度相差尙遠、已發現空前未有之低價矣、所以照大勢狀况測之、前途異常悲觀也、查客方在此週買去統計祇有三千六百十八包、内中同行進二百九十二包、比前週减四千包、行情跌二兩光景、標紗在此週間、步步而跌、各月份較前週跌四兩外、全週成交統計十六萬二千包、茲將各帮口買去之量、分誌如下、</p>

<p>▲婺源子茶已露嘴　婺邑子茶、因本年春産蝕收質育未盡茁發之茶樹、露嘴異常殷濃、兼之兩旬來天氣適宜、連朝降露、産質極稱良好、但號方以滬市始終不起、辦進春茶、已苦滯胃不化、對子産更難强食下咽、山户時茲市面、亦决抱定犧牲、任其老萎、免費辛勞、至春茶未活者、據最近調查、全邑不下二千餘擔、其中以北路沱川源爲最多、該處山户、迫於經濟之窘急、有貨不能換錢、困苦不堪言狀、春茶如此、子茶可知、　　▲屯溪茶市仍消沉　屯溪茶市、月來跟滬市不振之惡潮、奄無生氣、各茶行擁存四五千擔之積貨、迨竟罕人問津、客販日唯延頸企望滬棧轉機之電到來、乘時早脫、詎佳音未見、而警訊却頻傳、觸景傷懷、莫不切嘆茶業之終不可恃、市氣之消沉、於此可見、惟銷行國内店莊之茶末、價尙飛舞、每擔由十八元激漲至二十四五元、各茶店均移轉其對外目光視線以對内、紛紛派員馳往婺源等處、搜定再貨、以應需求、此亦洋莊茶市奇冷中、差可解嘲之插脚交易也、</p>
<p>▲祁子茶完全停輟　祁浮子茶出産、向稱豐厚、爲本邑第二筆收入大宗、曩年子茶市價、最高者常在五六十元、目下該邑各鄉子茶、雖芽長可摘、推號方限於滬同業制止採辦子茶之議决、及銀根枯澀關係、俱不敢添進增産、致碍銷塲、故本年祁浮子茶、已在完全停輟中、於本邑茶區農民經濟、大受影響、山户間有採製、係預銷國内店莊、價小辦微、簡直無市、</p>

<p>據近日息，上海方面，日本尙積極謀開圓桌會議，而東北方面，我國非但無收回失地的希望，聞日人尙有更酷辣更進一步的計劃，行將實現，假定我政府我民衆尙不覺悟，則亡國的慘幕，不久即欲揭開，</p>
<p>而顧我國内，土匪共黨之禍，幾到處皆是，廣東方面，二陳又互相火併，開演［全武行］的拿手好戲，而據中國國際貿易協會所發表之報告，謂日貨四月份與一月份比，激增達一倍以上，又今年一月至四月，進出口兩抵，入超總額，竟達一億七千數百萬海關兩，</p>

<h3>簡易製瓶詰法</h3>
<p>— 易民</p>
<p>十八日的本報，載着一段［自製罐頭法］，的確是利用廢物，有益貯藏的方法··不過中間說到另用洋鐵皮做蓋子一層，這却是難問題了，原來製罐頭用的洋鐵皮，是一種特製鍍錫量很多的洋鐵皮，在普通的商店裏不容易買到。（是美國貨，祇洋行裏有得出售，每箱要二十餘元）假使用餅乾空匣子，或是普通的洋鐵皮，那麽内容物一定要和牠起作用，而黑變，起銹以及種種的腐敗現象發生，現在我有一種簡易製瓶詰的方法··旣不要用洋鐵皮，又不要生爐子用封錫··並且很安全，很便當，反牠記在下面，讀者不難一目了然的。</p>
<p>一　製瓶詰的器具</p>
<p>甲，普能熱水玻璃杯一只，</p>
<p>乙，比玻璃杯口稍大一些的圓玻璃片一塊。可以畫了大小向五金店買··或是自己把窗上掉下來的破玻璃，先用墨筆在上面畫了所要的大小，再放在盛滿了冷水的大桶中，一手拿着玻璃，一手用舊剪刀輕輕的依着預先畫的紋路剪就得了，</p>
<p>丙，平面橡皮圈一枚，和玻璃杯口差不多大小，要有二分多闊，自己也可以把壞的籃球胆，足球胆，汽車裏胎做的。像皮圈的外緣，要有一塊凸出，橡蠶豆大小。</p>
<p>二　製瓶詰的方法</p>
<p>把要貯藏的食物，調理以後，放在玻璃杯内（不要放得太滿，離杯口至少要有半寸，）再把橡皮圈放在杯口上，用玻璃片壓牢，最好用較重的東西壓住，不過要使内部的氣體可以逸出。然後放在鍋子裏或是燉在飯鍋上，沸騰後二十分鐘，（視内容物之種類，時候有長短）取出，極力壓牢玻璃片，此時要使外界的空氣不侵入杯内，愈快愈壓得緊愈好。漸漸的放冷，到完全冷却之後，這玻璃片自然的會吸牢在玻璃杯上，至此全部工作即告成功。吃的時候祇要把橡皮圈上凸出的部份一拉，玻璃片自然會開的，玻璃片玻璃杯還可以留作第二次製造。</p>
<p>這種瓶詰如果大規模製造時，也可使用得，玻璃杯玻璃片可以向玻璃廠定做，橡皮圈可以向橡皮公司定做，（加熱時另有特種機械，以篇幅關係恕不多贅，如欲探詢詳情時，可函康腦脫路省立水産學校焦易民詢問。）這種瓶詰法最適宜用於菓蔬的貯藏，因爲鮮紅的菓子，碧綠的蔬菜，可以從玻璃中看見，引起買客不少的注意，至於保存的時期，據實騐所得菓蔬可以保存兩年左右；如果貯藏其他須要加高熱的食物時，因爲玻璃耐不起高熱，所以就不能有這樣的久遠了，又橡皮圈雖是不和内容物接觸的機會，不過是不妨事的。</p>
<p>家庭向問題</p>
<h3>鄭老太的話</h3>
<p>— 岩野</p>
<p>鄭太太養三個兒子，最小的也已二十五六歲，所以都已娶妻生子了，她帶着三子三媳和許多孫兒孫女，合居一宅，一門濟濟，人家都說好好福氣。</p>
<p>最近他們這個大家庭已分成三個小家庭了，有人問鄭老太說··你們一家團聚，多麽幸福，爲什麽現在無端把牠拆散掉呢？那知鄭老太還没回答他的話，却先長長的嘆了一聲，停了好久，她才滔滔地說道··人家說我三子都在社會上服務，賺錢回來養我，家中有三媳服侍，還有許多孫兒繞膝博我的歡笑，而羡我這種好福氣，其實我福未享着，而氣倒已受盡了當我的長媳娶歸後，他們夫妻倆待我百依百順，兄弟叔嫂間也很要好，此時我確覩着心歡，明年二媳進門了，我想多了一個媳婦，將更加享福了，那知二媳生成一副兇相，說話又尖刻非常，長媳本也是一個能幹人，她恃着先入門爲大的念頭，於是他們妯娌問便起了裂痕，二媳的兇言兇語，長媳聽了便指桑駡槐的說她，二媳自不相讓，加以反唇，親愛的家人，變成仇敵，雙方且各在枕畔向丈夫訴寃屈，兩子各聽了枕上語，就各帮着牀頭人，一個懷恨嫂氏，一個痛惡弟婦，終且兄弟亦成仇敵了，弄得我一個好好的家庭，充滿乖戾之氣，這樣過了兩年，三媳婦又進門了，誰知道好也是一個不怕硬的人，處處地方不肯吃人家一些虧，三兒也自然學兩兄之樣，帮着老婆，從此三對夫妻，便成了魏蜀吳三國，我聯絡你，你離間他，紛爭無已時，你也來告訴我，他也來告訴我，我雖秉着大公無私的態度下判斷，但他們終是說我偏心，帮了這個，帮了那個，後來我便不管他們，任他們去相爭相鬧。</p>
<p>家中的一切開支，本是三個兒子各拿出相等的錢來用的，自從三兄弟成爲仇敵後，便你也不願拿出，他也不肯即付，你說他賺得多，應多出些，他說你有子女，應多出些，今天長媳當灶買菜，二媳三媳說她菜不佳，揩了油去了，明天二媳當灶買菜，長媳三媳也這樣說，後天三媳當灶買菜，長次媳又這樣說，老實說，她們實在個個要揩油，的都把公吃的菜弄得簡陋不堪，而把揩油錢買了燻魚醬肉到房裏去吃，所苦的祗有我一個人。</p>
<p>三房都有子女，稚子懂得什麽，他們一會兒好好，一會駡駡，一會打打，眞是打了片刻又好了，好了不片刻又打了，而三個媳婦却每小題大做，爲了子女之事，幾天天要相駡，有一次，長房的六歲之子和二房的三歲之女在客堂中玩着，二房之女因爲他要想坐上一張矮凳上去，一不留神，便跌了過去，又很凑巧的把頭撞在另一凳角上，頓時他哭得透不過氣來，二媳在房中知道了，急急跑出抱起愛女，而把長房之子踼一脚，說他壞着良心推跌他女的，長房之子哭上高樓，告訴母親，他母親便在樓上向下大駡，下面的便向上駡，越駡越兇，一個說你敢下來，一個說你敢上樓，你不怕，我不怕，終於大家相遇於樓梯之下，打得落花流水，三媳在旁袖手冷笑，孫輩看見母親打架而大哭，我則氣得坐在房中不去理她們，讓她們羊咬殺狗也好，狗咬殺羊也好。</p>
<p>鄭老太說到這裏，好又深深地嘆口氣道，總之我們家中的不祥，一時也說不盡許多，你看我處在這個家庭中，是福呢？還是氣呢？我現在再也不能受這種氣了，再受下來，快要把我氣死了，所以我把他們分了家，任他們去各奔前程，我一個人住着，雇一小丫頭和我洗衣泡水燒飯，眞覺得清閒自在，現在眞個是享福了。</p>

<h3>Ｃhaperon的話</h3>
<p>— 綺懷</p>
<p>Ｃhaperon本來是一種帽子，中年婦人或是老處女帶了，用以爲表記的，到十九世紀，這個字却用來代表一般伴陪年輕女子，到公共處所的婦人，大槪當世男女社交尙未正式公開，凡是年輕女子與男子有所交談，女子的父母，有些兒不放心，總要呌Ｃhaperon隨同而去，這種風氣，據說現在還實行於英國的古式家庭内，假如你去拜望你的女朋友，或是請好一同出游，總有一個中年婦人，在你們的左右，</p>
<p>現在中國男女同學的大學裏，也有採取這種制度，這制度的良惡我不講，我祇談談曉得的一個大學裏，這種制度的實施，如其聯帶發生的故事，</p>
<p>某大學在某個秋間，實行男女同學了，但是牠設立地點，是在内地，男女社交，還不十分公開，所以那學校當局，將愼重起見，在招收女生的廣告上特别的聲明，關於女生一切特别有女學生舍監負責，在開學以後，更聲明採取了Ｃhaperon制度，就是，男女生的社交，只有一個星期六的下午，四時丨六時，如有特别事故，須到女生宿舍的，須要得着舍監的允許，再有，凡是女生參加任何公共游藝集會，像茶會，或旅行，且請了Ｃhaperon一同去，</p>
<p>這制度實行了，各方面都没有反對，女同學們，更靜悄無聞，好事的男同學們，也抱了［吹皺一池春水，千卿底事］的態度，只是空下來講，充作談天的資料罷了，</p>
<p>後來有一級旅行到附近的山上去，女同學是級内的一份子，當然要參加，但是Ｃhaperon，怎麽辦？鑒了上次，有一級出去野會，没有請Ｃhaperon，女同學轉來，受了女生舍監的一頓嚕囌，還到剥奪了月内出外的權利，所以這一次，更不能［明知故犯］了，於是級中就請女生舍監擔任這Ｃhaperon一職，這位女生舍監很老了，白白的頭髮，走路也似乎有些龍鍾，大致對於爬山，這玩意兒，總有些不高興接受罷，不料好却老當益壯，一口的應允下來，日期到了，他們男男女女一行人都興高采烈的，到了那郊外的青山，那位Ｃoaperon，眞是［克盡厥職］，［亦步亦趨］，的跟在女生後面，這一來，苦了一般等候機會，與女同學社交的男同學們，失掉了這種良好機會，另一方面，也苦了女生舍監的兩條腿，不知奔走了多少路程，</p>
<p>事情這模過着，種種的束縛，到底阻止不住青年男女好社交的天性，女生宿舍不能去，但是在Ｃha４eron的制度下，並没有規定女生夜間不許到圖書館去，所以在明燈初上，琳琅滿架的圖書館裏，總黑壓壓的坐滿了人，在那裏，正發生了不知多少韻事哩，</p>
<p>觸目驚心</p>
<h3>戰後的餘痛</h3>
<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>［啊！蓮姊好久没見了！你們搬在那兒？］我一見了表姊很徬徨恐懼的開始發問。</p>
<p>［愚園路×號！謝天謝地，不料我們還得相見！］他不自然地在她的喉管深處很輕柔而又帶有顫抖的流出了一聲。</p>
<p>［每聽得機聲軋軋，砲聲隆隆的時候，我的心兒也跟着它跳躍得非常厲害，尤其思念着您們一切的一切丨到底您是怎樣的脫險的呀？］</p>
<p>［我原料著我們的政府，一本愛好和平的精神，委屈求全，定能饜暴日的慾壑，安樂窠的上海，不至會有風吹草動的；誰知戰神···］此時她的聲調格外來得響亮，態度也很悲壯悱惻··［就是避難，也爲環境所限，無從而避，一家老幼，惟有面面相覷，夜以繼日的鏖著和戰神賭命！］</p>
<p>［婆婆和雄弟想都安好的吧？！］</p>
<p>［婆婆？死···了···雄弟病···倒在醫院裏啊！并且他如常閙得要見你表哥哥······］</p>
<p>［怎麽，怎麽？］我不待她話完便侷促不安的搶著追訊。</p>
<p>［那時我們的房屋附近地帶，形成了戰事的中心區域，當暴日的陸戰隊整天澈夜的機槍齊鳴，自然我們的房屋便成了垜靶，東邊才應著砲聲而倒，西邊又應著槍聲而塌，婆婆一時駭慌了，下氣接不著上氣，只見好從椅子上往下一梭，白眼烏珠往上一翻，便是死了！接著雄兒也嚇成神經病，這是醫生才證明的！］</p>
<p>［可憐！那末婆婆的屍骨怎樣辦呢？］</p>
<p>［唉！說起來眞是罪過！恰巧槍聲比較很疎同屋的林家嫂嫂說··［活命還難顧］硬嬲著我只覺得昏昏的只拖著雄兒逃了出來。直到停戰　去一看，但見一片瓦礫，還長著幾根青草，那裏還有房屋？更那裏還有波波的屍骨？］他的眼涙便𫃊𫃊地落了下來！</p>
<p>［刦後餘生的身體，擱不住再悲痛了，并且雄弟間接也會受到你的影響······］</p>
<p>［今日的閘北，飽受敵彈的荼毒，變成了一片焦土，和那破碎的瓦礫，焦黑的木屑，倒塌的墻壁，密如蜂窼的彈痕，觸目皆是······銀色般的涙珠，這時又由她眼窩裏一滴滴的涙點更不知淌了多少，襯上一付蒼白瘦俏的面頰，越發顯出她的悲哀苦楚，同時我也回想到戰區無數的被難同胞，不禁说凄然揮了幾滴同情之涙，雖然嘴裏還在喃喃勸她勿要哭！</p>
<p>［長期抵抗的政府，爲保持實權起見，忍痛妥協於帝國主義，日軍倒棄而來，滿載而歸的時候，我民間無量數的損失，不識政府曾爲一顧否？］</p>
<p>［唉！蓮姊，這樣的閒話怎樣好講，還是忍痛氣嘆的好！］</p>
<p>夕陽慢慢地渦没在地平線下，眉痕的新月已掛在那慘白的雲縫裏，這時我們便凄然作别了。</p>
<p>一九三二·六·一七，夜半作。</p>

<h3>German Nationalism and Anti-Capitalism</h3>
<p>We have repeatedly written about the political situation in Germany. German politics are the key to solving the puzzle of European politics, which compels us to pay close attention again and again. Since the establishment of the Papen cabinet in Germany, Hitler's power has surged domestically, and the clamor for debt relief has resonated internationally. When injustice occurs, voices arise in protest. The rise of this new force must be the result of a certain environment. I have pondered this with my eyes closed, yet still cannot grasp the details. Now, I have seen the recent lecture notes of Professor Henry de Man of the University of Frankfurt in Germany, titled [The New German Nationalism], which provide a very clear analysis. I am translating its meaning for the reference of those concerned with world affairs.</p>
<p>Since the signing of the Locarno Treaty, Germany joined the League of Nations, and Stresemann seized the opportunity to maneuver among the powers, no longer regarding Germany as a defeated nation. The Dawes Plan has been replaced by the Young Plan, and the troops stationed in the Rhineland have also been gradually withdrawn. Under these objective conditions, the high tide of German nationalism should have subsided. Yet, the national movement led by Hitler has continued to grow stronger. Why is this?</p>
<p>Modern political parties all have a class basis. To understand the class basis of Hitler's power, one must first understand the content of class differentiation in Germany. The anti-establishment classes in Germany can be broadly divided into three. One segment of workers, affected by the development of machinery, are squeezed out and jostled, falling into unemployment and forming the lower stratum of the proletariat, becoming a breeding ground for the Communist Party. This is one aspect. The development of machinery, on the one hand, squeezes out some artisan workers, and on the other hand, it can also improve the lives of some workers, forming the upper stratum of the proletariat, which becomes the core of the Social Democratic Party. This is the second aspect. The petty bourgeoisie and small citizens in the cities, as well as the independent farmers in the countryside, are either hit by the post-war economy, driven by the rationalization movement of industry, or controlled by entrepreneurs, living a life worse than that of laborers, or manipulated by capitalism, and the raising of interest rates in rural areas is causing the rural economy to decline day by day. Unwittingly, they gather under the banner of anti-capitalism, forming the organization of Hitler's forces.</p>
<p>The Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the National Socialist Party led by Hitler are three different forms of anti-capitalism in Germany. The Communist Party is revolutionary anti-capitalism, the Social Democratic Party is reformist anti-capitalism, and the National Socialist Party led by Hitler is nationalistic anti-capitalism. While all are anti-capitalist, the high tide of nationalistic anti-capitalism has surpassed everything else. The reason for this must be sought externally. Germany's sorrow is rare in modern times. The refusal to revise the Treaty of Versailles has made Germany bear the stigma of being the initiator of the Great War. The establishment of the Young Plan is far from sufficient to reduce Germany's heavy burden of reparations to the Allies. The repayment of debts is scheduled to extend to 1988. The sons, grandsons, and even great-grandsons of the German people will all share this heavy debt. This makes the German people feel that the root cause of Germany's sorrow lies not only within, but also without. Hitler's slogans of resisting Jews internally and resisting the powerful externally have deeply penetrated the hearts of the proletarianized petty bourgeoisie, small citizens, and farmers, bringing anti-capitalism and nationalism closer together, forming nationalistic anti-capitalism. Its expansion is rapid, all due to objective circumstances.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Germany's eastern neighbor, the Soviet Union, has been working hard to build up the country for the past ten years, breaking away from the shackles of post-war European relations and writing off the debts of the Tsarist era. While people are suffering from the economic panic, Russia is boasting of the success of the Five-Year Plan. This special spirit of struggle is indeed admired by the Germans who are suffering. The national Bolshevik movement suits the appetite of the oppressed people. Therefore, the sudden rise of Hitler's power is also a product of the times. However, the significance of this nationalistic anti-capitalist movement lies not in opposing capitalism itself, but in the anti-establishment class's unwillingness to accept the fate of being proletarianized. Therefore, the nature of the movement is emotional rather than rational, a natural impulse rather than a cultural progression, mystical rather than scientific, a manifestation of symbolic thought rather than the evolution of logical concepts, revolutionary but also counter-revolutionary. What it will stir up will be a huge twist in international politics and a huge wave in world culture. If the recently convened Lausanne Conference cannot leave a glimmer of hope for Germany, then Germany's nationalistic anti-capitalism will inevitably take risks, and the collapse of the European situation will likely spread to the world, and it will come into contact with the rapidly changing situation in East Asia like the shock of an electric current. Can the future of the world still be imagined?</p>

<h3>Wang and Others Invite Hu, Jiang, and Others to Talk</h3>

<p>(Beiping) Wang and Song visited the Temple of Heaven together at seven o'clock this morning. At noon, they invited Jiang Menglin, Hu Shi, and famous figures from the education sector to the Foreign Ministry Building to discuss solutions to the student unrest. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Hosts Banquets on Two Evenings</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang has scheduled to host banquets for Wang, Luo, Song, Gu, and others at his private residence at 7:00 PM on the 19th and 20th, and has invited various dignitaries to accompany them. The 19th is in Zhang Xueliang's personal capacity, and the 20th is in the name of the Pacification Headquarters. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Luo Discusses the Issue of Sino-Russian Resumption of Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Luo Wengan stated that he had many exchanges of opinions with the Investigation Team in this morning's meeting. The team's report will not be published until it reaches Geneva. The government's diplomatic policy requires the united efforts of the entire country to be effective. Regarding the issue of resuming diplomatic relations between China and Russia, we advocate first concluding a treaty of mutual non-aggression, and then resuming diplomatic relations. Russia advocates immediate resumption of diplomatic relations. The government is still deliberating. The League of Nations General Assembly has been postponed because it is feared that the report will not arrive on time. He will stay in Beiping for a few days and then return to Nanjing. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Mrs. Gu Has a Tea Party Tonight</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Mrs. Gu will host a tea party for the Investigation Team at her private residence tomorrow night. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Luo Receives the Swedish and Brazilian Ambassadors</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Luo Wengan is scheduled to invite Japanese reporters for a talk tomorrow afternoon. He will receive the Swedish and Brazilian ambassadors this afternoon and visit the diplomatic corps on the 20th for friendly reciprocation. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Wang Advocates Luo Continuing as Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Gu arrived in Nanjing. Luo was willing to yield the position of Foreign Minister, but Wang believed that no one in the country could do the job well. In the future, the focus of diplomacy will be in Geneva. He advocated that Luo continue. Gu's trip to France would benefit the country. Song agreed, and Jiang had no preconceived notions. The decision was made. With funds for embassies and consulates available, Luo is actively working. Xu Mo will serve as the political vice minister, and Liu Chongjie as the permanent vice minister. There will be increases and decreases in embassies and consulates, and personnel will also leave and stay. This will be realized soon. Luo has moved to the Foreign Ministry Building because the Beijing Hotel is noisy. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Wang Discusses the Limits of Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wang discussed the political situation and stated that there is a minimum limit to the diplomatic policy toward Japan. For example, the ultimatum given to us by Japan on February 20th would cause great losses to the country if it were accepted. He believed that it was below the minimum limit, so he decided to safeguard national sovereignty at the cost of everything. The Shanghai Truce Agreement established on May 15th resulted in the withdrawal of Japanese troops without any political attachments. This is above the minimum limit. It can be seen that the government is determined not to cede territory or humiliate the country in its diplomacy. (19th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>The Puppet State, at the Behest of the Japanese</p>
<h3>Seizes Northeast Customs Duties</h3>
<p>Xi Qia Issues an Important Statement</p>
<p>(Changchun) In order to establish the customs autonomy of the Manchurian state, Finance Minister Xi Qia issued the following important statement in his name at 3:00 PM yesterday:</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Manchurian state, it wanted to make customs independent through customs autonomy. For the sake of convenient handling, it officially proposed the following to the Nanjing government on March 21: (1) All customs houses in Dalian and the rest of Manchuria shall be under the jurisdiction of the Manchurian state. (1) Import taxes and their collection methods shall temporarily follow the current methods. (1) For those who repay foreign debts with customs duties as collateral, the Manchurian state shall prepare to separately share them in a reasonable manner from the customs revenue, but the remainder shall be retained and used by the Manchurian state. (1) The current customs personnel shall be used temporarily, but the appointment and removal of tax commissioners and cadres shall require the understanding of the Manchurian state. The Nanjing government not only did not agree to this proposal, but also urged the customs houses. Therefore, it issued a warning and first stopped remitting all customs revenue from Manchurian customs houses other than Dalian to the Nanjing government. However, the Nanjing government still did not reflect. However, we cannot delay the resolution of this issue and made a decisive decision to prepare to seize all the customs revenue of Dalian and other customs houses. On the 9th of this month, we notified Mr. Fukumoto, the Customs Commissioner of Dalian, of this intention and requested him to notify the Inspector General of Customs to allow the customs autonomy and customs independence of the Manchurian state. If the Inspector General of Customs and the Nanjing government continue to take a resistant attitude, the Manchurian state will take decisive measures and warn the Nanjing government that it shall bear full responsibility for the above.

<p>(Nanjing) The Dalai Lama's representative recently filed charges against the Panchen Lama. Yesterday, the Panchen Lama's representative, Kaosang Zangzan, filed charges against the Dalai Lama, requesting further punishment. Furthermore, Gesang Zeren sent a letter to the Central Government accusing Liu Wenhui of ten major crimes of wantonly harming the people with his troops. Liu Wenhui's representative, Leng, also petitioned the Central Government to investigate Gesang for raising troops in rebellion and seceding the Kang province. The government is consistent in its attitude toward the affairs of Kang and Tibet. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission is short of funds and unable to handle anything, so it can only allow things to drift naturally. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The National Government Re-emphasizes the Opium Ban</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) An order from the National Government on the 18th stated: Opium is a harmful substance that sickens the nation and harms the people. The government is determined to eradicate it and has repeatedly issued orders and decrees. Various opium prohibition laws and regulations have been promulgated successively, and special supervisory and guidance agencies have been established to supervise and promote their implementation. However, the country is vast and wide, and there may be areas that have not been thoroughly investigated. It is feared that remote provinces may become complacent over time, fail to implement the laws effectively, or shirk their responsibilities by citing special local circumstances, thus failing to completely eradicate opium and undermining previous efforts. Therefore, a special re-issuance of the prohibition order is made, with earnest admonitions. Hereafter, all local officials must strictly implement the current laws and regulations regarding opium prohibition, and must not pretend to comply while actually disobeying, treating them as mere formalities. If there are still instances of negligence, disregard for the prohibition orders, or harm to the local area, they will be investigated and punished according to the law. All officials must respectfully comply and not disobey. This order is issued. (19th)</p>

<h3>The Noulens Case is About to Open Trial</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Judicial authorities stated that the evidence in the Noulens case is very complex, involving the translation of various languages and the study of factual behavior, which takes a long time. According to the Criminal Procedure Law, the court must pronounce a verdict within four months after accepting the case, but this can be extended in special circumstances. The case has not yet exceeded the prescribed time limit. Recently, the lawyer issue has not been resolved. Foreign lawyers cannot appear in Chinese courts, just as Chinese lawyers cannot appear in foreign courts. The judiciary of one country cannot be undermined for the sake of one person. Chinese lawyers are not lacking in expertise in Chinese and foreign law. Even if Noulens does not hire a lawyer to appear in court, the court must appoint a pro bono lawyer to defend him. The case will be opened for trial in the near future. Because it is still within the period of investigation, there are many secrets.

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Military Reduction Representatives from Various Countries</h3>
<p>Conduct Private Talks</p>
<p>Seeking a Way to Break the Stalemate</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Geneva, 18th. It was expected that the representatives of various countries at the Disarmament Conference would use this week's holiday to conduct private talks. This was expected, and when Henderson proved that the countries, under the current circumstances, had no room for compromise on the report of the Disarmament Conference's Special Committee, it was expected that this would happen. Now, the chief representatives of various countries have decided to follow the advice of Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, and Bernas, Chairman of the General Reporting Committee, and hold private talks in order to get closer to each other. The representatives of various countries returned from Lausanne today. Simon has held talks with American representatives Gibson, Davis, Wilson, etc. There are also rumors that MacDonald will come to Geneva tomorrow for a few hours and will have lunch with the American representatives at the Canadian representative office. In addition, French representative Pongou will bring the final instructions of the French Council of State here tomorrow afternoon. Therefore, the British and American representatives can have fruitful discussions today. After the talks today, tomorrow, and Monday, the chief representatives may be able to find an appropriate solution. At that time, the leaders of the representative countries will order the experts to find in the reports of the various special committees what Herriot called in his cabinet declaration [the principle of partial solution].</p>
<p>France on the Reparations Issue</p>
<h3>Plans to Adopt Delaying Tactics</h3>
<p>German Chancellor Broadcasts a Speech</p>
<p>Urging the People to Unite Against Foreign Countries</p>
<p>Countries Signing the Oslo Agreement Request Tariff Reductions</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 18th. This afternoon at 5 o'clock, the ministers and vice-ministers of various departments held a cabinet meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Chairman Herriot reported on the diplomatic situation, paying special attention to the negotiations being conducted in Geneva and Lausanne. The cabinet unanimously agreed with the attitude adopted by the French delegation. After reviewing routine official business, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 18th. Today, prices on the Berlin Stock Exchange rose sharply during the first two hours of trading. However, after receiving a private telegram from Lausanne stating that France is now using delaying tactics and that the future of the reparations conference is uncertain, the gains were lost, and the market closed with uncertainty.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 18th. Herriot is scheduled to depart for Lausanne tomorrow night at 10 o'clock to attend the reparations conference.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 19th. Today, German Chancellor von Papen delivered a radio address in Lausanne, which was broadcast throughout the country via wired connection to the Berlin radio broadcasting station. He stated that the German delegation cannot achieve anything without the spiritual support of the entire nation. He asked the people to firmly believe that his representatives in Lausanne would not make any concessions on any important points and would spare no effort to achieve positive results. When criticizing the current cabinet and its measures, he urged the people to remember that he and his colleagues have gone to Lausanne to serve the country with all their efforts and deserve the support of the entire nation. He also asked everyone to rest assured that the cabinet, which he leads, will always consider the country as an indivisible whole and will not favor one class or party. However, at the same time, it is necessary to understand that in this critical period, any government that is determined to lead the country out of danger cannot ignore the broad nationalistic movement. When Papen mentioned the National Socialist Party at this point in his speech, he turned to the Lausanne Conference, emphasizing that the politicians gathered in Lausanne must understand that Germany is not only in an economic crisis at this time, but is also in a spiritual crisis. He hopes that these great politicians will keep this fact firmly in mind, so that they know that the Germans are not making sophistry as debtors trying to evade debts, but want to eliminate the tragic fact, not only so that Germany can benefit from it, but also so that the whole world can benefit from it. Finally, he asked the people to approach the upcoming parliamentary elections with a clear head, saying that in this time of diverse political views, there will naturally be even greater differences in the election campaign. However, everything has its limits, and election speeches should also strictly adhere to these limits.</p>
<p>Havas, Lausanne, 18th. In 1930, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Luxembourg signed the Oslo Convention, mutually agreeing to respect each other's interests within the scope of possibility and to take joint action to improve the general state of trade. On the 15th and 16th of this month, the foreign ministers of the six countries met here to discuss the current economic situation. They all believed that the increasing decline in the volume of international trade is extremely concerning, and the creation of new tariff barriers by various countries, as well as the adoption of other restrictive measures, are making the economic panic even more serious. It is necessary to put an end to this isolationist policy, otherwise the economic changes in various countries will run counter to the basic principles of a sound and rational division of labor between countries, and it will be too late to regret it. Therefore, the representatives of the six countries believed that it is essential to quickly reduce tariffs, rescue the monetary system from disorder, and reorganize international credit. The representatives of the six countries are confident that the decisions of the international conferences held at present and in the future will be in line with their hopes. They unanimously decided to request the Lausanne Conference to discuss the issue of tariff reduction.</p>
<p>Japanese Military to Issue a Statement to the Investigation Team</p>
<h3>Stating Attitude Toward Manchuria</h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 19th. The Japanese military plans to take the opportunity of the Investigation Team's return to Japan to request the government to declare Japan's attitude towards Manchuria. The specific plan was approved by the three chiefs of the army yesterday. If the government hesitates because of this, the military will decide to declare the following intentions separately: (1) Not to spare friendly assistance to the new country (2) Japan's foreign policy is limited to Manchuria. Because Manchuria has established a new country, as per the resolution of the League of Nations Council on September 30 of last year, the conditions are that the Japanese army withdraw to the South Manchuria Railway line, and China is responsible for protecting the lives and property of Japanese people. However, since then, due to the establishment of a new country, Chinese sovereignty no longer extends to Manchuria, and the national defense of Manchuria is consistent with Japan's national defense. Therefore, the League of Nations resolution prior to the establishment of the new country cannot be binding.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 19th. Because the League of Nations report of the investigation team has been postponed, an extraordinary general meeting will be held around the 22nd to discuss the postponement of the League of Nations general meeting. On the surface, the Japanese government does not seem to need to take an opposing attitude, but it reserves the right to tacitly acknowledge the final decision.</p>
<h3>Uchida Yasuya Visits Saionji</h3>

<h3>Japanese Proletarian Party Rejects Gu's Trip to Japan</h3>

<p>Korean Attempt to Bomb</p>
<h3>The Yalu River Railway Bridge Case</h3>
<p>Arrested Party Members to be Tried Tomorrow</p>
<p>▲ Japan Alliance News Agency, Ronan, 19th. Six Korean Communist Party members residing in Russian territory loaded powerful bombs onto small sailboats and sneaked from Vladivostok into Chongjin, Korea, to blow up the Yalu River Railway Bridge and major transportation facilities in Korea in order to disrupt the rear of the Japanese army in Manchuria. However, this great conspiracy was discovered by the Japanese authorities. The party members were reported on April 16, and on May 9, the Chongjin District Court attached to the public trial and scheduled a public trial on the 21st.</p>
<p>▲ Another telegram stated that the Chongjin Police Station in North Hamgyong Province, Korea, discovered a suspicious-looking Korean on April 16 and immediately sent him to the police station for questioning. According to his confession, he received a secret order from a certain party to blow up major railway bridges in Korea, hinder Japanese military actions, and disrupt the rear. He and five comrades carried many bombs from a certain place and arrived in Chongjin on the evening of the 14th, burying them in the sand by the sea, waiting for an opportunity. The authorities immediately sent personnel to the scene for investigation, and as a result, they found many bombs, handguns, etc., which were extremely shocking. All police officers were immediately convened, and as of the 19th, all the criminals had been arrested. They are all from Hongwon, North Hamgyong Province. Their names are as follows: Lee Woon-yak (48 years old), Cao Long-gyu (27 years old), Kim Myung-hwa (40 years old), all three are fishermen, Zhang Dai-feng (23 years old) is a pancake seller, He Nam (25 years old) is a teacher, and Park Chun-seop (39 years old) is a boatman. They received bombs, food, and 700 yen from a certain party and sailed from a certain port to Vladivostok and then to Chongjin. The bombs seized were tested by the authorities and found to be of three types: 400 grams, 220 grams, and 200 grams, all of which are highly powerful.</p>
<p>After the Private Army Ban</p>
<h3>All of Germany is Disturbed and Uneasy</h3>
<p>Anti-National Socialist Party Movement Underway</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 18th. Since the lifting of the ban on the National Socialist Party stormtroopers, the resistance of local governments in various states has been recorded in previous reports. Now disturbances have occurred in various places, such as Communist Party members and members of the Republican Reichsbanner Society rising up to clash with the National Socialist Party's brown-uniformed stormtroopers. The most incidents of this kind occurred in the west of Germany, especially in the Rhineland. In Hamburg, a conflict between the two sides was dispersed by the police, resulting in one protester and one police officer being injured and killed. The German cabinet, seeing this situation gradually expanding, decided after a report from Interior Minister Geer to convene an important meeting of the interior ministers of various states in Berlin in order to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 18th. A movement to jointly resist the National Socialist Party seems to be underway. The Communist Party has invited the Social Democratic Party, the Federation of Trade Unions, and the Republican Reichsbanner Society to join forces with the Communist Party to demand the abolition of the ban on open-air rallies and demonstrations, and it is planned that the four organizations will join forces to resist the common enemy, starting with street demonstrations. Representatives of the Social Democratic Party, the Federation of Trade Unions, and the Republican Reichsbanner Society replied that the Social Democratic Party, etc., have no objection to joint action, but they regret that the Communist Party is still engaged in slandering the leaders of the Social Democratic Party and the Federation of Trade Unions and that detailed discussions of cooperation can only be held after this kind of action is immediately terminated.</p>
<p>Chilean New Government</p>
<h3>Will Adopt a Dictatorial System</h3>
<p>Civil Officials are All Soldiers</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Argentinian Capital, 18th. According to news from Valparaiso, the entire territory of Chile is now occupied by soldiers, and civil officials have been replaced by soldiers. From now on, there will be a long and strict dictatorial system, which is almost certain. The general opinion is that Chile, after this coup, no longer has the danger of communism. The leader of the new government is the Ambassador to the United States, Davila. It is said that the current political system is indeed more suitable for Chile.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Chilean Capital, 18th. The Chilean Air Force, which played a major role in overthrowing President Montero two weeks ago, suddenly became active again today. Its soldiers appeared simultaneously at three airports, dispersed the personnel in charge of the airfield, and intercepted a destroyer ordered to transport the leader of the revolutionary army, Grove, to an island for imprisonment. According to the new government of the moderate faction, the first action was to order the arrest of Grove and exile him to a certain island.</p>

<p>Peak of the Harz Mountains in Germany</p>
<h3>Reenactment of Medieval Magic</h3>
<p>Attempt to Transform Ram into Handsome Youth Unsuccessful</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 18th. Yesterday at midnight in the Harz Mountains in Germany, a medieval magic (i.e., fairy magic) experiment was conducted. It was initiated by the British Society for Psychical Research, and the president of the society, Preece, acted as the main performer, with Professor Jule from London assisting. The location was the Brocken, the highest peak in the Harz Mountains, which is praised in German literature and songs as the place where all the gods and witches gather on their staffs. The purpose was to transform a male white lamb into a handsome young man and marry him to a beautiful virgin. Yesterday evening, the girl and the lamb led the way, followed by Preece and Jule, leading the crowd to ascend the peak. However, Preece had previously told reporters that he did not expect it to become a reality, but only wanted to prove that it was not necessarily possible to transform a lamb into a handsome young man. Later, the experiment was not successful, probably because Preece had this doubt in his heart and was not sincere. The location of the experiment was in a magic triangle, outside of which was a magic square, then outside of that was a magic circle, and the outermost layer was the assistant performer. The British people, each wearing evening dress, formed a large circle. All the arrangements followed what was recorded in the magic books of the Middle Ages. When the time came, the performance began. All the actors respectfully held the spells, chanting words in their mouths, and shouting loudly. Unexpectedly, the lamb was still a lamb, and the girl in white glared at the onlookers, eating and laughing secretly, unable to taste the sweetness of the new marriage. After thirty minutes, they decided to stop the performance. They are now planning to ask a real witch to perform the magic again tomorrow, as the people in charge are still afraid that the general amateur researchers of magic have not obtained the true transmission, so the magic is not working.</p>
<h3>Three Earthquakes in One Day in Mexico</h3>

The Chinese consul and his wife, Sir Ho Tung, and people from the London consulates of various countries came to congratulate them.</p>

<h3>The American Democratic Party Will Convene a Convention</h3>
<p>To Nominate a Presidential Candidate for the Next Term</p>
<p>Whether Roosevelt Can Win the Nomination Remains Questionable</p>
<p>▲From our National Press Agency, Chicago, 18th: The key figures of the Democratic National Convention have now gradually gathered in Chicago. As for the Democratic presidential candidate for the future, although there is talk of nominating New York Governor Roosevelt, opposition is brewing from all sides. The director of Roosevelt's presidential campaign has declared that he will certainly obtain the nomination in the first ballot, but the opposition party claims that the convention will have unexpected results. In short, the most active issue at this Democratic National Convention is not the prohibition issue, but the question of whether Roosevelt can obtain the presidential nomination. As for the prohibition issue, it is said that although the Democratic Party cannot directly advocate the direct abolition of the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution, its position is closer to relaxation than that of the Republican Party.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle Outside Harbin</h3>
<p>▲Gong Changhai's Lone Army Advances</p>
<p>▲Approaching Five Li Outside Harbin's Suburbs</p>
<p>▲Retreating After Japanese Reinforcements Arrive</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Among the anti-Japanese righteous armies currently active in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, besides General Ma Zhanshan's troops, the self-defense forces of Feng Zhanhai and Gong Changhai, and the National Salvation Army of Wang Delin are the most steadfast and resilient. After the retreat from Dingli, Feng Zhanhai and Gong Changhai personally led the right-wing army, gathering 30,000 troops, adopting guerrilla tactics, and operating in the area of Mao'ershan, Ashihe, and Shuangchengzi along the Harbin-Suifenhe Railway, with the aim of attacking Harbin, tying down a significant number of Japanese troops. One brigade and two detachments led by Gong Changhai are the backbone of the right-wing self-defense force. All of their troops are cavalry, fierce and brave, often engaging in desperate battles with the Japanese army, which the Japanese army suffers the most from. Gong himself comes from humble origins, is familiar with the local geography, and has a clear plan, so his advances and retreats are well-founded and he has never been defeated. This gentleman is truly an eccentric among the leaders of the righteous armies in northern Manchuria. However, his troops lack sophisticated weapons, especially artillery, so they are often unable to exert their full strength. Otherwise, his recent solo effort would have already approached the suburbs of Harbin, and recovery would be expected. However, although this battle failed due to the lack of artillery power, it inflicted extremely heavy casualties on the Japanese army. This time, Gong's army came to attack in three routes. One route was led by Gong himself, advancing from the southwest of Harbin, taking Tianjia Shaoguo, with the goal of the Japanese headquarters in Nangang. Another route, with about a thousand people, advanced along the railway from the Wujia Station on the southern line of Harbin, taking the front of Harbin, with the goal of the main station, in order to coordinate with the branch attacking Tianjia Shaoguo. Another cavalry unit of 800 men attacked from Huangshan Zuzi in Budong, with the goal of the Three Trees Bliss Temple, to take a pincer attack. At 3:00 p.m. on the 11th, the route attacking Huangshan Zuzi launched first, crossing the Lalin River, pressing on the puppet army of Xi Qia led by Li Wenbing. The puppet army collapsed at the sight of the self-defense force. By evening, the self-defense force had reached the Han family Wuzi and Yuan family Wopeng in Budong. Residents in the Budong area all fled into the city. For a time, order was greatly disrupted between the Three Trees and Taiping Bridge. Seeing that the puppet army was not effective, the Japanese army urgently dispatched a large force to resist, supervising the battle with artillery fire, forcing the puppet army to counterattack. Thereupon, the puppet army counterattacked desperately. The self-defense force was unable to withstand the fierce attack of the Japanese and puppet armies and retreated to the left bank of the Lalin River. The Japanese army immediately stationed troops across the river from the puppet army, sealing off all boats in the river to prevent the self-defense force from attacking again. This route was therefore unable to make progress and support the front. On the same day, fierce fighting broke out in the Ashihe area. The self-defense force, led by Yao Bingqian and Yang Zibin, cut off the telephone lines between Ashihe and Harbin, dismantled the tracks at Chenggaozi Station (23 kilometers from Harbin), and ambushed cavalry. A train of Japanese soldiers, hearing that Acheng was under alert, set out from Harbin to provide support. When it arrived at the damaged tracks, it was blocked. The self-defense force ambushed and surrounded the train, inflicting extremely heavy casualties on the Japanese army. Later, a relief team sent from Harbin assisted in the defense, and the self-defense force retreated. The train was repaired in the afternoon and arrived in Acheng. At that time, there were more than 400 refugees fleeing from Acheng at Chenggaozi Station, who were conveniently transported to Harbin. That night, the fighting in Acheng was still fierce. The artillery fire from both sides never ceased throughout the night. The Japanese army concentrated all its forces to deal with that front. Gong Changhai, at dawn on the 12th, first used a thousand cavalry and the Big Sword Society and Red Spear Society, to turn to Wujia Station on the Harbin-Changchun Railway (33 kilometers from Harbin), occupied the station, and advanced rapidly along the railway, passing Shenjia Wanggang and Kaoshan Village, encountering a large Japanese army. The two sides fought fiercely. The Big Sword Society charged into battle, and the sounds of killing shook the wilderness. Although the Japanese army had artillery fire, they could not deploy it, and retreated step by step. At the same time, the route led by Gong Changhai himself occupied Chenggaozi Station at 9:00 a.m., taking Changlinzi, Hadataun, and Sunjia Wopeng, only five li from the city. The puppet army's Fourth Brigade, led by Chen Decai, went to resist, and after being attacked by the Red Spear Society, was cut into several pieces and retreated all the way, already approaching Tianjia Shaoguo. At this time, the left and right routes of the self-defense force had formed a link, and the density of gunfire and artillery could be heard clearly in the city. The general traitors in Harbin were extremely panic-stricken, fearing that the righteous army would attack and rushing to hide in the Japanese institutions. The Japanese army urgently transferred the Hito Contingent that was attacking the Anda Station back to Harbin at 8:00 p.m. to resist in the suburbs, and used a large cavalry force to encircle and outflank Wujia Station, attacking the rear of the self-defense force. The self-defense force was still unaware and continued to advance fiercely. After 8:00 p.m., it rained heavily, and the entire army fought in the rain. However, the ammunition was mostly wet, and the sound of artillery gradually diminished. After 11:00 p.m., the self-defense force discovered that the Japanese army had appeared in the rear, and abandoned their previous achievements and retreated towards Acheng. By 2:00 a.m. on the 13th, the battle ceased. At noon, the Hito Contingent pursued to Wabenkuli and Zheng Huangqi Wutun, and was fiercely repelled by the self-defense force, safely returning to Acheng. The troops attacking Acheng also withdrew completely on the afternoon of the 13th, and the two armies joined forces and retreated to the Mao'ershan area. By 4:00 p.m. on the 13th, there was no more fighting between Ashihe and Harbin. Eastbound passenger and freight traffic was barely open to Ashihe. It is heard that the self-defense force and the National Salvation Army convened a meeting in Xiachengzi on the Harbin-Suifenhe Railway on the 11th for the sake of great unity and offensive strategy, with Ma Xianzhang as chairman, to decide on issues such as supplies, reorganization, and command. There are now daily battles between Yimianpo and Ashihe, and the tracks are broken in many places, and there is almost no hope of restoring traffic. The section between Hengdaohezi and Yimianpo is controlled by the Japanese army, and traffic can still run daily. The two brigades of Japanese troops, Itada and Murai, do not dare to move slightly, for if they move, they will be ambushed by the righteous armies. (13th)</p>
<h3>Newspaper Commentary</h3>
<p>The Attitude of the Investigating Committee</p>
<p>▲Only France Still Expresses Sympathy for Japan</p>
<p>Nagasaki Daily News says: Chairman of the League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen, Hymans, was originally scheduled to participate in the committee meeting next week. However, the report of the investigation team will not be delivered until mid-September, so the date of discussion will also be postponed. However, according to information transmitted from various European sources, the attitude of the members of the investigation team in the League of Nations is that the United States is consistently anti-Japanese, Italy is indecisive, Britain focuses on trivial issues, Germany is trying to develop its own trade, but the French member still expresses sympathy for Japan.</p>
<h3>India, Switzerland, and Egypt</h3>
<p>Boycott Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reports that recently, Japanese cotton silk cloth and other cotton fabrics have been imported into the Indian market in great quantities. The Indian government has decided to adopt methods to restrict the import of Japanese goods. The famous newspapers Langen Jia and De News there warned the government that the large-scale import of Japanese goods is enough to suppress Indian industry, and urged the government to quickly formulate strict countermeasures. The Bombay Visiting Association advocated imposing the highest tariffs on Japanese goods and discussed various means to prohibit the import of Japanese goods in order to restore Indian industry. It is also said that Switzerland had already followed the example of various countries and implemented means to prevent imports. This time, it further restricted the quantity of imports of silk fabrics, rayon products, and mixed fabrics from Japan, that is, according to the regulations of 1931, any Japanese goods exceeding the import quantity would be subject to a heavy tax of seven times the original amount (2,000 法郎) per day. It is also said that the tariff rate for rayon fabrics in Egypt was previously levied at 20% ad valorem. This time, it was suddenly changed to a specific duty, which is actually 60% higher than before. Therefore, the import of silk fabrics from Japan to that country, in April alone, has reached more than one million yuan, and will be greatly affected in the future.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Patriot in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Mr. Liang Wenzhou Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: On May 29, Li Haiqing's troops fought fiercely with the Japanese army in Zhaodong. Because their forces were no match, they retreated westward. Japanese aircraft took the opportunity to pursue and drop bombs. Mr. Liang Wenzhou, the chief of the political training department of the troops, took refuge in the forest and was killed by a bomb that pierced his waist and hips. According to records, Mr. Liang Wenzhou was a native of Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, and was 34 years old. He graduated from the agricultural department of Tokyo Imperial University. During his time at the university, he was involved in the revolution. After returning to China, the central government appointed him as a member of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Affairs Preparatory Committee. Later, he went to Ziyou County, Henan, and founded a coal mining company with several like-minded comrades. However, it failed due to insufficient capital. In 1931, Wu Huanzhang, a member of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Department, telegraphed him to return to Heilongjiang to organize a large-scale provincial farm, which was in the planning stage when the September 18th Incident broke out. He was extremely saddened and drank and sang madly with his friends Wu Huanzhang and Liu Yungong all day long, suffering from hematemesis. Recently, he returned to his native Hulan to encourage the patriotic spirit of young people. Hundreds of people volunteered to join, and he organized a militia, serving as the commander-in-chief himself, and led the team to sneak into the Songhua River defense fleet, intending to seize all the armaments of the ships to replenish the military strength. Unfortunately, it was detected by the puppet army, which launched a joint attack. The matter failed and collapsed. Seeing that the militia was defeated and could not form an army, Liang joined Li Haiqing's troops and served as the chief of the political training department, striving to encourage the patriotic ideology of the entire army. Li Haiqing's troops have been able to resolutely resist Japan and continue their efforts today, thanks to Liang's efforts. Now he has died under the bombs of Japanese aircraft, which is tragic.</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang</h3>
<p>Implements Military Action Against Hainan</p>
<p>▲The Training Regiment First Drives Away the Tangjiawan Naval Vessels</p>
<p>▲Eight Regiments Concentrated in Leizhou to Cross the Sea and Attack Hainan</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since Chen Jitang took over the navy, which led to a disturbance, a part of the naval fleet sailed to Qiongya, and a part concentrated in Tangjiawan, which belongs to Zhongshan County. Qiongzhou is far away in Hainan, and the army's forces are not easy to reach, while the Tangjiawan naval vessels are located in Zhongshan because Zhongshan is a model county and has no army stationed there, so it is used as a land supply port. Chen Ce's navy has been independent for more than a month, and after the mediation of Xiao Focheng and Hu Hanmin, it is rumored that there is hope for a reconciliation of the naval incident. In fact, since the army and navy broke up, their attitudes have become extreme. Their insincere consultations with third parties for peace are actually both sides wanting to take this opportunity to prepare for military action. Recently, the members of the Central Executive Committee stationed in Shanghai again sent Ma Chaojun and Zhong Tianxin to Guangdong to discuss a peaceful resolution of the naval affair with Chen Jitang. As a result, they gained nothing and quietly left Guangdong to return to Shanghai to report. After Ma and others left Guangdong, Chen Jitang issued an order to use troops against Qiongya, first sending the Second Regiment of the Training Division directly under the General Headquarters, led by Liang Gongfu, with all the soldiers and artillery and machine gun companies, to Shiqi (the old city of Zhongshan County) at full speed. Zhongshan has never had an army stationed there before. Liang's troops came suddenly, knowing that they were dealing with the navy in the Tangjiawan area. On the 14th, Liang's regiment indeed advanced from Shiqi to the areas of Tangjiawan, Pingyan, Maowan, Nanlang, and Xiazha in the direction of Qianshan, deploying and defending along the coastline, and threatening the offshore fleet of the navy docked in Tangjiawan. The warships, seeing that a large force was suddenly stationed on land, and being driven away by force, sailed to the waters of 𣒣jiao on the same day and temporarily anchored. The Jiangda warship also sailed to the waters near Macau on the same day and anchored. It is estimated that more than ten warships left Tangjiawan on the 14th, but it is not yet possible to predict whether the warships will launch a counterattack along the coast in the future. However, Tangjiawan and other places in Zhongshan, which are known as model counties, have recently entered a state of martial law. Chen Jitang's sending troops to drive away the Tangjiawan fleet this time is actually the first step in military action against Qiongya. The action to attack Qiong will be implemented within days. Currently, the troops attacking Qiong, who have gathered in the Leizhou and Xuwen areas, number about eight regiments. Chen Hanguang's Guard Brigade's First and Third Regiments are currently deployed in Haikang, and the Second Regiment is heading to Xuwen, where it will join forces with the Independent First Regiment led by Zhang Wentao in Xuwen to prepare to cross the sea as the vanguard. As for the Independent First Regiment led by Liang Gongwu, it has also arrived in Leizhou, and the Fourth Independent Regiment has also arrived from Gaozhou. On the 13th, Chen Jitang ordered the Aviation Department to send an air force squadron to assist in the battle. The Aviation Department has assigned the Fourth Air Force Squadron led by Tan Shou to prepare to mobilize. A telegram from Xuwen recently stated that the mechanics and technicians of the air force squadron arrived in Xuwen yesterday, and the Xuwen airport has been repaired, and the aircraft can land at any time. On the 13th, the General Headquarters also sent personnel to hire the Dongtai ship to transport military barbed wire and electrical defense equipment to the front for the purpose of deploying the Leizhou coast.

<h3>Fang Shengtao</h3>
<p>Resigns as Acting Chairman of Fujian Province</p>
<p>▲The People of Fujian Hope that the 19th Route Army Will Resolve the Problem of Bad Troops</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Yang Shuzhuang, the chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, resigned from the National Government due to illness last autumn, but it has not been approved. Only Fang Shengtao, the director of the Public Security Department, was appointed as acting chairman. Yang has not yet returned to Fujian, so the saying that the provincial government will be reorganized has been repeatedly rumored. Since the 19th Route Army entered Fujian, the clamor for the reorganization of the provincial government has risen again. The candidate for chairman was previously rumored to be Jiang Guangnai, but since Jiang was appointed as the Pacification Commissioner of Fuzhou, it is now rumored to be Chen Mingshu, saying that it will be announced after the entire 19th Route Army arrives in Fujian. According to the news from the provincial government, Yang Shuzhuang will return to his post as chairman after the 19th Route Army arrives in Fujian to implement the reorganization of Fujian. It is not known which is true, but the atmosphere of reorganization is becoming increasingly tense. Fang Shengtao's attitude is also very negative. He believes that after the establishment of the Pacification Headquarters in the future, all local troops will be under its control, and there is no need to establish the Public Security Department. Therefore, he first resigned from the provincial government the day before yesterday, requesting that Lin Zhiyuan, a member of the provincial government, be appointed as acting chairman, and recommended Chen Wei yuan, the chief of staff of the Public Security Department, as the brigade commander of the Third Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Force, and combined the troops of He Xianzhu, Liang Jichuan, and Chen Tong, which are currently stationed in Putian and Xianyou, into a brigade. He also incorporated the troops of Huang Bingwu, which are currently stationed in Minqing, into the troops of Qian Yuguang, the commander of the First Provisional Brigade of the Provincial Defense Force, and expanded it into the Fourth Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Force, so as to become an entire army, so as to avoid being disbanded in the future due to being fragmented. He also transferred Guo Yongrong, the director of the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau, to be the director of the Xiamen Public Security Bureau, and transferred Wu Shu, the director of the Water Public Security Bureau (Fang's brother-in-law), to be the director of the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau. Yan Hanmin, the section chief of the Public Security Department, was transferred to be the director of the Water Public Security Bureau. Guo Yongrong has already gone to Xiamen with Lin Zhiyuan to contact the garrison commander Lin Guogeng. Lin Zhiyuan also went to Zhangzhou to discuss the issue of the transfer of the 49th Division led by Zhang Zhen and the reorganization plan. Liu Heding, the commander of the 56th Division, previously led a regiment of troops from Yanping to the province to maintain the defense of the provincial capital and act as the chairman of the Provincial Defense Committee because Fang Shengtao went to the lower reaches to supervise the army. Now that Fang has returned to the province and the Pacification Headquarters is about to be established in the provincial capital, he has resigned from the post of chairman of the committee and is scheduled to lead the team back to Yanping on the 15th to preside over the defense of northern Fujian. The second batch of the 19th Route Army, the 60th Division led by Qu Shounian, will arrive in Quanzhou on the 14th. In recent days, various groups in Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen have sent telegrams one after another to welcome them, and they have said that the people of Fujian have suffered from the oppression of bad troops over the years, and their suffering from extortion, looting, and massacres is no less than that of the Red bandits, and they hope that after the army comes to Fujian, they will wipe out the Red bandits and thoroughly resolve the problem of bad troops, so as to reduce the local burden, liberate the people's oppression, and make the future of Fujian turn to light.

<h3>The Communist Bandit Disturbance in Guangji</h3>
<p>▲The County Seat is Looted Clean</p>
<p>▲Large Armies Gather in Wuxue</p>
<p>Wuxue Dispatch: Guangji is located in the eastern part of Hubei, a key area connecting Hubei and Henan, and bordering Ying and Huo in Anhui in the east, and Shang and Guang in Henan in the north. In recent years, the communist bandit disaster in eastern Hubei has become increasingly serious. Luo and Ma in the two prefectures have repeatedly been lost. The two counties of Huang and Guang have long been ravaged. The county seat of Guangji has been lost and recovered three times. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 a.m. on the 10th of this month, Guangji suddenly received a report that a group of hundreds of Communist bandits had suddenly arrived in the Baishi Mountain area several miles away from the city gate in the north. They were fully armed with guns. The 200-300 men of the county's standing training team went to resist. Before long, it was reported that the main force of the Red Army had five or six thousand men and came surging in. The team could not withstand the crowd and collapsed immediately. The Red Army immediately entered the city and robbed and killed everything. Merchants' slightly better goods were all confiscated. The sound of robbery and killing was unbearable to hear. Residents all supported the old and carried the young, fleeing to Wuxue. The Communist bandits' goal was originally Wuxue, but fortunately, it rained heavily in Wuxue all day long. The vanguard bandits, who were at Dajinpu, 30 miles away from Wuxue, could not advance due to the heavy rain. Several thousand refugees from Guangji arrived drenched. The shops in Wuxue also closed one after another. Regiment Commander Dong of the 34th Division stationed in Wuxue, seeing that the bandits were numerous and we were few, immediately declared martial law and sent a team to the north to stand by in a strict formation. For a time, the market was full of rumors and panic. The Chamber of Commerce repeatedly sent urgent telegrams to the General Headquarters in Hankou and the Pacification Headquarters, requesting that a large army be sent to the rescue day and night to relieve the suffering. At 8:00 p.m., it received a reply from the Pacification Headquarters saying that it would immediately send all of Shangguan Yunxiang's 47th Division to Wuxue at full speed, and on the morning of the 11th, it sent two bombers to Wuxue to investigate and bomb Guangji. A Shun Sheng warship also sailed on the river, patrolling up and down. However, at this critical juncture, the original 34th Division stationed in Wuxue only had two battalions, which were difficult to cope with. Just at that time, Zhang Xincheng, the regimental commander of the Second Regiment of the First Brigade of the 47th Division, was leading his troops on the Fuyang ship to concentrate in Hankou. When passing by Wuxue, Regiment Commander Dong of the 34th Division saw a warship passing by and personally went to the river bank with a life-saving flag to ask for help. Regiment Commander Zhang then ordered the ship to stop. Regiment Commander Dong and representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, the Party Department, and the Public Security Bureau boarded the Fuyang ship together to meet Regiment Commander Zhang and told him that Guangji was captured by bandits yesterday and Wuxue could not be defended in the morning and evening, and begged him to land and provide assistance quickly. Regiment Commander Zhang immediately sent a telegram to the General Headquarters to ask for instructions, and the reply ordered him to stand by on the slope. The next afternoon, Brigade Commander Du Shu of the First Brigade of the 47th Division also arrived with his troops. On the 12th, Deputy Division Commander Pei Huichang arrived with the division headquarters personnel, and the place was finally safe and the people's hearts were settled. It is heard that Division Commander Shangguan Yunxiang will also come to Wuxue from Hankou to sit down and wait for the entire division to arrive before launching an attack on Guangji. Multiple aircraft have been bombing Guangji for days, killing many bandits. Currently, trenches have been dug and strict defenses have been deployed in the Wuxue area. According to reports, the Communist bandits are the Fourth Army of Kuang Jixun's Red Army, and it is said that Ji Hongchang's mutinous soldiers are also among them. The bandits knew that a large army had gathered in Wuxue and that Guangji was in danger of being surrounded, so they began to retreat from the county seat on the 14th to the Qingshui River area 30 miles to the west, relying on the terrain to defend. The Wuxue Chamber of Commerce has been providing supplies for the soldiers day and night, and the expenses for the hospitality are quite large, but the market has become very depressed as a result.</p>
<h3>The Anhui Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Handles Post-Disaster Relief in the Bandit Area</p>
<p>▲Sends Tang Qizhuang as the Special Commissioner for the Seven Counties in Western Anhui</p>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: The counties in western Anhui have suffered from the communist bandit disturbances, and the people have been displaced and their houses have been destroyed. Recently, the bandit forces have become increasingly rampant, so the central government specially transferred the First Division led by Hu Zongnan and the Fourth Division led by Xu Tingyao to Anhui to launch a large-scale suppression. The bandit forces have been slightly suppressed as a result. On the 17th, the Anhui Provincial Government's Standing Committee decided to send Tang Qizhuang as the special commissioner for post-disaster relief in the seven counties in western Anhui to handle post-disaster relief matters. Wu Zhongxin, the chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, also telegraphed Wang Jun, Xu Tingyao, Hu Zongnan, and Chen Diaoyuan, asking them to instruct their troops to provide liaison. The telegram said in brief, "It has been found that the disaster situation in the bandit-affected areas of western Anhui is extremely serious, and the land is devastated. The threat of communist bandits lurking in secret is a crisis. It is deeply believed that military and civil affairs should complement each other. With regard to the major tasks of settling refugees, investigating households, and reorganizing the local security police, it is necessary to establish a post-disaster relief agency to assign responsibilities and provide guidance. After being submitted to the Anhui Provincial Government meeting, it was decided to designate Hefei, Huoqiu, Liu'an, Huoshan, Yingshan, Shucheng, and Shouxian as bandit-affected areas, and Tang Qizhuang was selected as the post-disaster relief special commissioner to go to his post on time. The official has a well-known reputation and is familiar with the situation. He will definitely be able to adapt to the situation and make proper arrangements. You have been leading the army for a long time and are concerned about the people's suffering. I hope you will provide assistance in many ways to save the country together and instruct your troops to make practical liaison in the area to provide convenience. The refugees who have suffered from the war will be extremely grateful. In addition to submitting a report to the central government for record and ordering the county heads to follow the order, I am sending this telegram for your information and hope you will reply."

<h3>Shandong Province Cancels the Title of Garrison Army</h3>
<p>▲Shandong Troops Have Forced Their Way into Puyang City</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Liu Guitang, Guo Mafeng, and other troops were previously incorporated by Han Fuju and given the title of Shandong Garrison Army, ordering them to be stationed in Gaotang and other areas in northern Shandong, intending to train them and reorganize them into elite troops. However, the bandit Liu's nature was difficult to change. In the Gaotang area, he continued to extort and levy taxes, and the residents could not bear it. Recently, he rebelled again and fled to southern Hebei, capturing Puyang. Han Fuju ordered Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 22nd Division, to supervise the three brigades of Zhang Shulin, Chen Dexin, and Li Hanzhang to advance rapidly and pursue the bandits, and telegraphed Liu Zhi in Henan and Zhang Xueliang in Beiping to send troops to assist in the suppression. Currently, the Shandong troops have approached Puyang City. Liu Zhi sent a division of troops, and Zhang Xueliang sent two brigades of troops to encircle the bandits. A general attack will be launched soon. The three-province bandit suppression army will be commanded by Sun Tongxuan. Sun has moved from Guancheng to Chaozhou. At the Shandong Provincial Government meeting on the morning of the 17th, it was decided to issue a circular canceling the title of Shandong Garrison Army for Liu's troops. The circular said, "Since Liu Guitang surrendered, he was reorganized into the Shandong Garrison Army and ordered to be stationed in Kangtang County, hoping to train him and make him an example so that he could be effective and contribute. However, the wolf's ambition is fickle and he has dared to rebel and drive out the county head and seize the local militia guns. His rebellious actions are obvious and outrageous. He was immediately dispatched to suppress him severely. The bandit is now fleeing on the border of Shandong and Hebei and is being pursued. All the former titles of Shandong Garrison Army have been canceled to avoid further disturbances under the guise of the title. In addition to sending a telegram to the neighboring provinces to intercept him, this circular is hereby issued for your information."</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲ The Chamber of Commerce's Stance on the Special Business Tax: The Special Business Tax implemented by Jiangsu Province has been explicitly ordered to be abolished by the Yuan and Ministry. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, facing financial deficits and accumulated losses over the years, has been pushed to the brink of collapse. Although the abolition was ordered by the Ministry and Yuan, it is impossible not to implement it in reality. Therefore, it continues to summon preparation personnel from various counties to gather in the province for deliberations, still scheduled to implement the tax collection on July 1. On the other hand, Chairman Gu and Director of Finance Shu have repeatedly consulted with the standing committee members of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation regarding the current financial situation of the provincial government. If new taxes are not implemented, the only option is to consult with various counties to borrow 2 million yuan to tide over this difficulty. The Chamber of Commerce Federation believes that 代籌借欵, not only does it not have this system, but also the silkworm harvest this year has been poor, and commerce is declining, facing an increasingly precarious situation. It is planning to request the government to find ways to provide relief, how can it open its mouth to merchants again? As for the special business tax that the provincial government is currently planning to implement, although the name stipulates six types, its detailed items list more than 360 items. Furthermore, setting up checkpoints for inspection at important ports makes it easier to initiate corruption and delays, which is contrary to the central government's repeated strict ban on levying disguised likin. It has already submitted a request to the provincial government to allow the suspension of the tax based on the facts. Moreover, Qian Sunqing, a standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce Federation, further put forward his opinions yesterday: (1) 代籌二百萬 is contrary to the system, and at this time of commercial depression, the Chamber of Commerce cannot represent the interests of merchants, it really has no face to speak to merchants; (2) The special business tax has been ordered to be abolished by the Ministry, and there is no way to recognize it at all. If the authorities insist on acting arbitrarily, then merchants are under violence and can only be slaughtered at will, of course, they dare not resist, but there will be a day of reckoning in the future; (3) Changing the business tax to a license can only be regarded as an improvement in the method of collection. It must still be under the principles of the general outline of the Ministry of Finance's collection of business tax and its supplementary measures passed by the Central Political Conference, and cannot be violated in the slightest, so as not to shake the foundation. As for the financial difficulties of Jiangsu Province, it is rumored that the provincial authorities have informally stated that it is an accumulation of deficits since the 16th year of the Republic, which is not a matter of one day, and has nothing to do with the current government. However, since the 16th year of the Republic, the provincial government has undergone repeated changes, and whether the handover of each term is clear, and the finances have never been made public, should be shared with the people of Jiangsu. When Zhang Shouyong, the former Director of Finance, handed over his duties, he issued a book to the people of Jiangsu, recounting the process of financial management. It has not been heard that anyone has been deficient. When Chairman Ye succeeded him, he first proposed a policy of austerity. If the current situation is followed, then what is real and what is false is deeply doubted. It is advocated to request the provincial authorities to remove the sentimentality, publicly investigate, and if any malfeasance is discovered, immediately follow the precedent of the provincial department's unclear handover to the county bureau, or malfeasance, detaining and pursuing, and confiscating property for compensation, and reporting to the central government. For the former provincial government authorities who have not handed over clearly, those with positions will be suspended, those without positions will be strictly arrested, and each term will be calculated in order to rectify the officialdom. If the finances of Jiangsu Province can be thoroughly disclosed to the people of Jiangsu in this way, and if there is still a shortfall, the people can understand each other, or other methods can be devised to make up for it. Otherwise, even if a few members of the Chamber of Commerce Federation are coerced into agreeing, the majority of the people of Jiangsu will never willingly submit, etc. The above opinions have been written down yesterday and submitted to the Chamber of Commerce Federation's regular meeting on the 21st for discussion, and to express to the provincial authorities in a practical manner.</p>

<h3>Labor University</h3>
<p>Declaration by the Teachers and Staff School Protection Committee</p>
<p>▲ Lists Six Reasons Why It Cannot Be Shut Down</p>
<p>▲ Asks for Sympathy and Assistance from All Sectors of Society</p>
<p>The Declaration of the Teachers and Staff School Protection Committee of the National Labor University states:</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese imperialists have invaded and occupied the Eastern Provinces. The Shanghai battlefields were stained with blood. Unfortunately, our school was located in the war zone and suffered greatly under the artillery fire. Since the government signed the truce agreement, the Japanese army withdrew from the war zone and the land saw the light of day again. We hoped to reorganize and rescue cultural institutions from now on, and diligently implement the plan of [ten years of recovery and ten years of education]. Unexpectedly, the only labor education system to realize this recovery and education is now being brutally destroyed by the government. On the 11th of this month, our school received Instruction No. 4177 from the Ministry of Education to handle the complete closure. How can we not be shocked? A month ago, our school, in view of the urgency of future recovery and education and the imperative to avenge our shame, convened a school affairs meeting and publicly resolved to submit a request to the Ministry of Education for permission to enroll students. Who knew that the Ministry of Education's rejection of the enrollment document would arrive at the school in a few days? It can be seen that the Ministry of Education does not want the people to seek their own recovery and education and avenge their shame. This did not start with the instruction to handle the closure this time. In recent years, the country has faced many difficulties and social disputes, and there is no environment for reading. It is difficult for educators to run schools with peace of mind and for students to study with peace of mind. The colleagues of our school, in view of the urgency of this situation, have been trying their best to reorganize and overcome the difficulties. Unexpectedly, the Labor University's budget was changed by the Ministry of Education and reduced by half. After it was reduced, it was withheld again. After it was withheld, the established funds were not distributed on a monthly basis. However, this is not the worst. For the past two years, our school has repeatedly submitted plans for reorganization, improvement, and expansion of labor education, but the Ministry of Education has not approved them. It is not a matter of one day that it has been deliberately destroying labor education. This did not start with the closure order this time, nor did it start with the prohibition of enrollment this year. The Ministry of Education's hatred for Labor University was originally caused by the Minister of Education's personal political enemies. Because of emotional reasons, it does not hesitate to arbitrarily destroy the only new education system in the process of national rejuvenation that enables compatriots to strive for survival. Is this tolerable? What is not tolerable? Not only will poor children have no university to attend in the future, but the educational policy of only avenging private grudges will make it impossible for all schools to stay away from political trends, and it will not be possible to plan for the great cause of cultivating talents for the nation. The Ministry of Education's instruction to completely close Labor University has only two reasons: one is [achievements are not significant] [equipment is simple], and the other is [losses from the Shanghai Incident, the number required for restoration is even greater, and it is even more impossible to do in reality]. However, these reasons cannot stand. Please sincerely explain them to the public as follows: In the past, when the anti-Japanese war started, the government repeatedly warned the people not to be too eager for success. Now, the government itself is being too eager for Labor University. Isn't this a contradiction? For a century-old plan, wanting to see results quickly in three or four years may be possible for outsiders. The Ministry of Education itself is in charge of education, but it does not know the principle of cultivating people for ten years. Isn't it taking education as a child's play? Moreover, revolutionary construction is not a matter of one morning and one evening. It is not possible to achieve great achievements in one fell swoop. In the past, imperialists and warlords of the Northern Warlords scolded the Chinese revolution for not succeeding. The government authorities replied that the revolution could not succeed in the short term. Now, for Labor University, which has not been established for long, it is blamed for its significant achievements. Isn't this a heavy responsibility for people? This is the first point. Labor University adheres to the purpose of labor education. Students work, in addition to labor, also use their bodies. Each week's coursework emphasizes reading, listening, and physical work. Students must read books on one hand and work in farms and factories on the other. They only use half of their energy to write exam papers. The Ministry of Education then judges the results based on this half of the work. The other half of the work was destroyed by the violent Japanese. The Ministry of Education does not recognize it and ignores the value of labor. There is no greater example of this. This is the second point. For school equipment to be perfect, there is one fundamental condition, that is, the funds must be sufficient. The Ministry of Education reduced the school's budget from 600,000 yuan per year to 360,000 yuan. The Ministry of Finance allocated funds to Labor University, but the Ministry of Education withheld as much as 7,500 yuan per month. Strangling its throat and resisting its back, how can it be expected that the person's body will develop? Isn't this a particularly absurd thing? Now, the Ministry of Education is stingy and misappropriates the funds of Labor University, and expects its equipment to be perfect. Isn't this asking a skilled woman to cook without rice? Those who hold power in the Ministry of Education are either ignorant of the educational world or nitpicking. The educational world after the war has this phenomenon, isn't it heartbreaking? This is the third point. The educational and cultural expenditures in the budgets of various countries are increasing with the progress of the times. Our national intelligence is already lagging behind, and the educational expenditures are repeatedly given sparingly by the government. According to the budget for the year of the Republic of China, the national educational expenditures only account for 3.39% of the total pure expenditures, while military expenditures account for 53.92% of the total pure expenditures. Emphasizing the military over education is like this, emphasizing the useless military like this, emphasizing the military that does not resist strong neighbors like this, belittling education like this, belittling the education of education, recovery, and avenging shame like this. Isn't this the government surrendering to imperialists before the people? This is the fourth point. The total revenue in the budget for the year of the Republic of China is 858,874,557 yuan, and the total expenditure is 893,335,073 yuan. The balance between revenue and expenditure is not enough for 34,460,516 yuan. However, since the Ministry of Finance's newly revised method for repaying the principal and interest of domestic debt was implemented, the domestic bonds payable this year have been greatly reduced to within 103,200,000 yuan, which is less than the 108,178,669 yuan for domestic bond principal and interest in Item 1 of Section 12 of the regular expenses within the budget, actually reducing the regular expenditures by 64,900,000 yuan. Using this number to offset the insufficient surplus of 34,400,000 yuan, there is still a surplus of 30,518,153 yuan. Who can believe that the government's expenses are tight, and it cannot even raise funds for the relief of education in the war zone? This is the fifth point. Granted that this year the violent Japanese invaded and military expenses increased, however, the expenses purely for regular military equipment within the budget are 268,000,000 yuan per year, with an average actual expenditure of 22,330,000 yuan per month. According to the latest financial austerity measures set by the government, military expenses are only stipulated to be 10 million yuan with change per month. There is obviously a surplus. During the bloody battle of Shanghai, special expenses were needed, but the budget already includes reserve funds available. Moreover, during this bloody battle, compatriots both at home and abroad generously donated and enthusiastically transported supplies. Colleagues in the poor and impoverished educational world still saved money and food and donated salaries to resist the enemy. Counting all the generous donations from the masses, the amount is huge. How much did the government actually bear? Can it use the excuse that the anti-Japanese military expenses were too large and there were no surplus funds to save the dying education? This is the sixth point. To sum up the six items above, whether from an educational standpoint or a financial standpoint, the government has no reason to order the closure of Labor University. By observing the times and examining the needs, after the bloody battle of Shanghai, in order to revitalize the nation, we must devote ourselves to labor education, which militarizes students and workers. Workers produce and soldiers defend the country. Military national defense requires physically strong citizens, and economic national defense requires workers who can manufacture by hand. Labor education provides students with military and industrial training. Using the spirit of this system to reach the people, we can usually develop the country's productive forces, so that the invisible tariff wars can be won. In wartime, we can replenish national defense, so that military wars can be triumphant. This is precisely the necessary</p>

<p>The second question we discussed at the banquet was about recruiting students. Old Madam Song asked Mr. Zhu how many people he planned to enroll. Mr. Zhu said, "[One is fine, a thousand is also fine.]" Old Madam Song said, "[There are plenty of students who want to study. I'm just afraid we won't be able to accommodate them all. If Mr. Zhu can even take in a thousand, then we don't have to worry.]" Brother Chun Sheng asked, "[At what age can children start school?]" Mr. Zhu said, "[One year old is fine, a hundred years old is fine.]" Everyone laughed and said, "[According to you, we can all be students. That's great.]" Secretary Li asked, "[There are many children who want to come but can't. What can be done about that? For example, Niu'er, who lives next door to me, relies on herding cattle for a living. His desire to enter school is like lovesickness. But if he goes to school, he won't have food to eat. If he wants to eat, he can't go to school. Teacher, there are many children like Niu'er. What can be done? For example, I, Old Li, although I've wasted forty years, also want to learn a few characters, but I can't close my shop to study, can I? Because if I close my shop, I'll go hungry and have to pawn my pants. That's definitely not fun. (Everyone burst into laughter.) Teacher, what's the best thing to do?]" Mr. Zhu said, "[There is a way. Instead of recruiting students to school, it's better to bring education to their door. It's not impossible for us to deliver education on the back of an ox. If you don't mind, we can also bring some educational gifts to you.]" Secretary Li was extremely happy to hear that, and everyone said that this method was good.</p>
<p>Amidst the laughter in the room, I couldn't help but be skeptical. Mr. Zhu's words were a bit beyond my expectations. I had to think. I couldn't just echo what everyone else was saying. Mr. Zhu came here alone. A thousand students? How easy is that? How can one person manage it all? That thousand people isn't the maximum limit. Tasting his tone, it seems that he could take in even more. As for one-year-old children, how difficult are they to raise! Mr. Zhu isn't a woman. If dozens of infants who need to be breastfed come, wouldn't this ancient temple become a living-in, dying-out orphanage? And he's still not satisfied! He still wants to deliver education on the back of an ox! He still wants to deliver education into the blacksmith's shop! He can't do it even if he has a hundred hands and a hundred legs. Is he exaggerating? Is he joking? Is he just casually placating the villagers? I can guarantee that he's definitely not that kind of person. My brain has become a battlefield of these conflicting opinions. I was stunned and lost in thought. I even thought about questioning Mr. Zhu on the spot, but I was afraid of saying the wrong thing. Until the end of the banquet, I was like a mute.</p>
<p>Following the path, its beginning is very small, but its use is extremely large. I deeply hope that people in society will look one step ahead and cooperate with us to save this labor education, which is a matter of life and death for national revival. Moreover, the Labor University is the only school to relieve the children of the poor and to prepare for solving people's livelihood problems. The only way to save China is to make every Chinese person not lazy, not parasitic, hardworking, and self-reliant. Thus, it depends on the support and promotion of labor education. Therefore, we not only passively demand that the Ministry of Education withdraw its order, but also actively demand that the Labor University's deposits in the Ministry of Education be allocated as the Labor University's fund. Now, unfortunately, it has been brutally destroyed and oppressed, and while a breath of life remains, we should issue a cry of injustice and seek sympathetic help. Those who recognize the needs of the times, those who stand in front of the times, those who love poor children, and those who support impoverished education, please rise up quickly and join us in a fierce movement to protect the school. 21.6.14</p>

<p>▲The Danish Team Actively Prepares</p>
<p>丨Includes the all-European cycling championship athletes丨</p>
<p>▲About 120 British Athletes</p>
<p>丨Appointed hurdle star Bob Tisdall as Captain丨</p>
<p>▲Japanese claim that they can beat the US in lacrosse</p>
<p>Copenhagen, Denmark - The president of the Danish Olympic Committee, Vice Admiral Carl Carstensen, is working hard to select a strong Danish team for the Los Angeles Games. He said that he would not leave any promising individuals in the country. As for travel expenses, Danes of American origin have agreed to help. The Danish government will be responsible for the journey from Denmark to New York, and Danes of American origin will be responsible for the journey from New York to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The Danish team will have six cyclists, including Henry Hansen, the all-European champion. Others such as Harding Thomsen and Anderson for the 1,500m and 5,000m are all hopefuls for track and marathon events. In field events, there is Möller in the javelin, Rasmussen in the jumps, Masgard in the shot put, and Olsen in the weightlifting. The rowing team is also very strong. The women's swimming team also has many strong athletes, such as Jacobsen, Carla, and Anderson for the short distances, and Larsen-Frumann for diving.</p>
<p>The British Olympic team, after a meeting in London, has appointed Bob Tisdall as captain. Bob has accepted. Bob is a world-renowned hurdler. The British team is estimated to have about 120 members.</p>
<p>According to news from the Japanese side, the United States only started lacrosse last year, and its history is very short. However, the United States is deeply afraid of stumbling, and in a short period of time, has recruited professional athletes to supplement its strength. In terms of the situation, Japan should be able to beat the United States, because Japan has fifty years of lacrosse history. As for India, which is in second place, if it can beat a few countries in Central Europe, then Japan will surely win the championship.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Continuous Rainy Weather</h3>
<p>▲The Huangpu River is Rising···Electrical Wires are Damaged</p>
<p>▲Low-lying Areas are Flooded···Cargo Ships are Sinking</p>
<p>Shanghai has experienced continuous rainy weather for the past two weeks, without a single day of respite. Until the day before yesterday (Saturday), there was a clear day, but at around 12:00 AM, it suddenly rained again. At first, it wasn't very heavy, but by dawn, it was pouring down. Yesterday, there were showers all day, causing the Huangpu River to rise and the low-lying areas of Zhabei to become almost like a swamp. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲The River Tides Surge Yesterday afternoon at around 1:00 PM, the reporter inspected the Suzhou River area for business and saw that the river tides were surging. The lowest-lying area from the New Bridge to the Dawangmiao Ferry Terminal was only a foot or so away from the shore. However, the rice industry docks on the east and west sides of the New Zhabei Bridge were newly built embankments and were relatively high. The depth of the section from the New Garbage Bridge to the Old Garbage Bridge, the Old Zhabei Bridge, and the Pentang Nong Bridge varied. The lowest point was only a foot or so away from the water surface.</p>
<p>▲Electrical Wires Damaged Starting yesterday morning, the telegraph lines set up between Jiaxing and Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway were slightly damaged by the continuous rain, causing communication to be disrupted. The branch telegraph lines from Shanghai South Station to North Station were also disrupted. Therefore, yesterday, direct telegrams from Shanghai to Hangzhou were not possible, only to Jiaxing. The Electrical Affairs Department of the Railway Bureau sent workers to investigate and repair the lines.</p>
<p>▲Flooding in Zhabei The low-lying areas of Zhabei, such as the mound behind the Yong'an Company warehouse on Zhongxing Road, both sides of the new roads of Gonghe Road and Zhonghua Road North, both the north and south sides of Pushan Road, the north section of Datong Road, and the area south of the railway near the Dayan Temple to the Meigen Road Station, were flooded due to heavy rain, which could not be drained in time, turning them all into swamps. At the intersection of Xinhua Lane on Jiaotong Road and various alleys of Puaifang, the water was more than a foot deep, and board doors were used to cross the water. The houses across from Zishou Lane and Yuanyuan Lane on Yongxing Road, which were bombed and burned by Japanese soldiers, were all submerged in water. The section from Mindong Road to Han Bridge had become a river. Other roads were also washed away, with water accumulating on both sides to form channels.</p>
<p>▲Cargo Ship Sinks Shipowner Guo Chunbao loaded 150 dan of broad beans from the interior to Shanghai, entrusting merchant Chen to sell them. Yesterday morning, when the ship sailed to the Huangpu River near Longhua Bay, the rain was very heavy, and the wind and waves were particularly strong. Moreover, the ship was heavily loaded. It was overturned by the wind and waves, causing Guo and his crew to fall into the water. Four people were rescued by other ships. There is still one crew member whose whereabouts are unknown. Guo hired a ship to salvage the beans, but after the broad beans were soaked in water, they swelled and burst the ship's hull, causing irreparable damage.</p>
<h3>Ma Chaojun Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Publishes Account of Mediation of Guangdong Affairs</p>
<p>▲Sun Zhesheng Will Continue Mediation</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that Mr. Ma Chaojun, a member of the Central Committee, went to Guangdong to visit relatives. When he arrived in Hong Kong, the Guangdong Incident suddenly broke out. He received telegrams from Mr. Sun Zhesheng, entrusting him to mediate between the two sides to avoid civil war. He returned to Shanghai on the Russian Empress ship on the 16th and arrived at the port yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM. The reporter of the Far East News Agency inquired about the progress of the mediation in Guangdong, and Mr. Ma received the reporter. According to Mr. Ma, he originally went to Guangdong to visit relatives. As for mediating the Guangdong incident, he received telegrams from Mr. Sun Zhesheng in Hong Kong, entrusting him to mediate the Guangdong incident to avoid civil war. He felt obliged to mediate. He advised both Chen Jitang and Chen Ce, from the standpoint of friendship, to resolve the matter peacefully, because during this time of national crisis, we should first stabilize the country and then resist foreign aggression. Both sides each presented their opinions and asked Mr. Ma to convey them. According to Chen Ce, (1) the Marine Corps should be transferred to the province and handed back to the government for reorganization; (2) Qiongyai should be handed back to the government for reorganization; (3) the name of the Fourth Fleet should be restored; and (4) the arrears of wages for April and May of this year should be cleared. As for the intentions of the Guangdong authorities, they were also conveyed to Chen Ce. (1) The navy has already been divided into river defense and sea defense, and has been resolved by the Political Committee, so it is not convenient to make any further changes; (2) If Chen Ce wishes to go abroad, the government can give him a suitable title. Chen Ce indicated that if the conditions he proposed could be accepted by the Guangdong authorities, he would agree to go abroad. Chen Jitang intended that Chen Ce must submit to his command before he could stop attacking Qiong. As a result of Mr. Ma's several mediations, Chen Ce decided to take into account the national fortune and the people's lives, and would not resist. If the Guangdong side insisted on attacking Qiong, he was willing to give way and would not fight for right or wrong, asking the people of the country to judge. Therefore, according to the current situation, although there is conflict between the two Chens, there is still hope for a peaceful solution. At this point, the reporter asked for his feelings about the Guangdong dispute. He said that our country is facing internal and external troubles one after another, the people are suffering, and the country is in danger. It is truly unbearable to have another civil war. Therefore, all parties should take the stand of seeking survival for the nation and happiness for the people, and jointly devise a plan to resist foreign aggression. We must not harbor selfish views, lest we delay the country's major plans. He himself was guided by this purpose in this mediation. Now that Chen Ce has made a gesture of concession, the crisis should have the possibility of turning around. Although this trip has been repeatedly busy, if we can truly avoid civil war, it can be said to be gratifying.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Ma took a car back to his private residence on Huanlong Road to rest for a while, and then rushed to Molly Road to visit Mr. Sun Ke to report on the mediation of the Guangdong affairs. Mr. Sun expressed his respect and appreciation for Mr. Ma's efforts in mediation, disregarding the hardship. After listening to Mr. Ma's report, Mr. Sun indicated that he would continue to persuade both sides, hoping for a peaceful solution to avoid war.</p>
<h3>Japanese Marines</h3>
<p>Organize Patrols Yesterday</p>
<p>▲At the request of Japanese residents</p>
<p>The Da Gong News Agency reports that the Japanese Residents' Assembly and various union associations, considering that the Japanese Marines have withdrawn separately after our side took over the various branches in the Fifth District, are using the excuse that the police force is weak and insufficient to protect the safety of Japanese residents in Shanghai. Therefore, yesterday morning, they sent many representatives to the Japanese Military Club to meet with Commander Sugisaka of the Special Marines, requesting that Japanese Marines be added to the positions of sentries on North Sichuan Road, Dixiewei Road, Baz Road, Wusong Road, Road, Schkotta Road, and Doralan Road in order to ensure the safety of Japanese residents. After considering this, Commander Sugi Ban thought that distributing sentry posts might cause misunderstandings, so it was not convenient to implement. However, as a precautionary measure, he agreed to organize 26 Japanese Marine patrol teams, each with 14 members, plus one captain to lead them, to patrol the various roads in shifts to maintain public order. Therefore, since yesterday, these Japanese military patrol teams have been found in the North Sichuan Road area.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Organizations</h3>
<p>Again Request the Suppression of Traitors</p>
<p>▲Acts of revenge and murder occur from time to time</p>
<p>▲If they are allowed to spread, there will be no peaceful days</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation, the Hongkou District Branches, and the joint office of more than 20 organizations such as Xizang Road, Yinxiang Huade Road, East and West Huade Road, Haining Road, Broadway Road, Suzhou Road, North Jiangxi Road, Hanbilly Road, Yangshupu Road, Yokohama Road, and Avenue Edward VII, for the frequent occurrence of traitors' vendettas on Dixiewei Road and Tiantong Road, have sent a letter to the Public Works Department Taxpayers' Association, requesting them to send detectives to suppress them. The letter is as follows:</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Public Works Department: Since the Shanghai Incident, our area has been reduced to a war zone, and massacres and killings are almost commonplace. Now that the war has ended and order has been restored, we were hoping for some relief and a chance to resume our livelihoods. However, since the takeover of Zhabei, the traitors who used to lurk in that area have regarded Hongkou as a special area, and they also believe that they have protection. They swarm here like bees and ants. Therefore, we have previously sent a letter requesting their suppression in order to stabilize the local area. Now, we have repeatedly received reports from shops on Dixiewei Road and Tiantong Road that the traitors are still rampant and that acts of revenge and murder occur from time to time, causing merchants and residents to tremble with fear. If they are not strictly expelled from the country and severely punished, they will spread and the residents will have no peaceful days. We are sending a letter to your department, requesting that you send more detectives to strictly investigate and arrest them in order to stabilize the local area and ensure commercial peace. We hope that you will investigate and deal with this matter quickly. With utmost respect, we send this letter to the Public Works Department. ▲Letter to the Taxpayers' Association: We have recently received reports from shops on Tiantong Road and Dixiewei Road that the area has been swarmed by traitors, and that cases of revenge and murder have followed one after another. If we continue to allow them to lurk in the area, the hidden dangers are unimaginable, and we tremble with fear at the thought of the future. We have previously sent a letter to the Public Works Department requesting that traitors in the Hongkou District be strictly suppressed, and we have also requested that your association unanimously advocate for this. We are now forwarding the previous reasons and hope that you will send another letter to the Public Works Department, requesting that they send more detectives to investigate and arrest them in order to stabilize the local area. With utmost gratitude, we send this letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association.</p>

<h3>Telegram Requesting Assistance for the Northeast Righteous Army</h3>
<p>The Joint Association of Various People's Organizations telegraphed: "To all newspaper offices, for the public's information: Since the diplomatic authorities signed the humiliating agreement, it is no different from inviting Japan to move its troops northward and concentrate its forces to massacre the people of Northeast China. The country is shattered, and the blame is theirs. Recently, international conspiracies have gradually been exposed, colluding with each other to convene a round table conference to achieve their goal of jointly managing Manchuria and establishing a free city in Shanghai, a scheme for joint aggression and partition of China. The signs of disaster are gradually emerging. If not for the passive indifference of the officials, how could it have come to this? In foreign affairs, they rely entirely on the League of Nations, acting weakly and incompetently. In domestic affairs, they chant the high-sounding slogan of long-term resistance, harming the country and endangering the people. Since the September 18th Incident, the anti-Japanese righteous army in the Northeast has been fighting bitterly for several months under the dual oppression of the violent bandits and Chinese traitors, but the authorities have never provided assistance. If this is allowed to continue, the Japanese will inevitably defeat them one by one. If our people do not rise up quickly to seek survival, the future will be fraught with crises, and the disaster will be more than just what we are experiencing now. Therefore, we hereby telegraph, hoping that the people of the whole country will not have the thought of living in a corner in peace, but should embrace the heart of shared destiny, rise up together, assist the anti-Japanese righteous army in the Northeast, and do their best to oppose the realization of the round table conference and the free city of Shanghai. We await your response with utmost anticipation. The Shanghai Joint Association of Various People's Organizations." Xiao.</p>
<h3>University Students' National Salvation Association Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Sends Police to Prevent It</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association originally scheduled to convene a meeting at the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Group at 1:00 PM yesterday (the 19th). The association had previously sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau requesting that police be dispatched to maintain order at the time. After receiving the letter, Director Wen believed that the association's meeting had not been approved by the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau beforehand, and there was no letter from the Municipal Education Bureau proving it. Therefore, he believed that the procedures were not in compliance and naturally prevented the assembly. It was found that the area was under the jurisdiction of the Second District and the Second Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The bureau was afraid that reactionary elements might be lurking there, disrupting local security. Therefore, in addition to ordering the captain of the detective team, Lu Ying, to send personnel to investigate and police officers of the police brigade to implement precautions at the location from 11:30 AM yesterday, he also instructed the precinct chief, Tang Jinghuan, to send police to jointly strictly prevent it. It was reported that only a dozen people went there at about 2:00 PM that afternoon, and no meeting was held.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</h3>
<p>Fourth-Class Passenger Cars Suspended Today</p>
<p>▲Allocated for Military Use</p>
<p>The 10th Division under the command of Jiang Dingwen, stationed in Jiaxing, and the Customs Police Group of the Ministry of Finance, were ordered to depart and needed four trains. After receiving the order, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau, having no cars to allocate, had to allocate the 39th and 40th third and fourth-class passenger cars on the up and down lines for military use. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the fourth-class cars arriving at the South Station from Hangzhou were emptied of passengers, and the empty cars were all transferred to Jiaxing at 8:00 PM that night. At the same time, a special empty train was also dispatched from the North Station and the Maigen Road Station to Jiaxing. Therefore, starting today, round-trip fourth-class passenger cars have been completely suspended and will be restored after military use, which is said to take about three or four days.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Freight Cars Also for Military Use</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has temporarily suspended all freight trains since the 12th of this month. This is because the 9th Division of the Army stationed on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line was ordered to be transferred to the Nanjing-Shanghai line and Bengbu, etc. The railway's vehicles have all been allocated for military use. At the same time, the First, Second, and Third Regiments and the Independent Brigade of the Customs Police Headquarters were also ordered to go to Haizhou. Therefore, the traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line has been extremely busy in recent days. Customs police transported from the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to Shanghai have continued to arrive at the Gaochangmiao riverside wharf and have been transferred to the Hexing and Xing Shi steamers to go to Haizhou. The Second Regiment of the Customs Police stationed in Jiaxing has been transferred to Songjiang in batches. The Independent Brigade of the Customs Police originally stationed in Songjiang and Xin Zhuang has been ordered to go to Haizhou and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, still taking the Xing Shi and other steamers from the Gaochangmiao riverside wharf to Haizhou. It is also reported that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway will dispatch four more trains from Jiaxing to Nanjing today, and five special troop trains are prepared at the Nanxingqiao Station in Hangzhou, with a total of</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>(Shen Bao Third Edition)</p>
<p>150 cars, scheduled to be dispatched in batches from the 21st of this month to Shanghai and then transferred to Nanjing. It is said that the troops are the 10th Division under the command of Army Commander Jiang Dingwen. Therefore, since the railway has stopped lending cars, it is still difficult to resume. At the Shanghai section, the waiting goods at the Hongkou Station and the two stations for export have been piled up like mountains and cannot be transported. The general forwarding industry is full of sorrow and sigh. In addition, it has been raining heavily for days, and all the goods piled up outdoors have suffered losses. Although the railway bureau has maintained commercial transportation every day and opened special freight trains, the goods are still coming in an endless stream and remain the same.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association</h3>
<p>Allocates Funds to Console Martyr Meng</p>
<p>Meng Fanqi, the attached company commander of the 7th company, 2nd battalion, 2nd regiment of the Tax Police Corps, was ordered to defend Miaohang in this Shanghai incident. After being injured, he was sent to the 34th Hospital, set up by the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, for treatment. He died of his serious injuries. The hospital allocated over one hundred yuan for funeral expenses and entrusted the 84 yuan left by the martyr to Chen Zhuyun, the medical director of the corps, to be handed over to his family for use. Zhang Minglian, the company commander of the company, informed the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association of the handling situation yesterday and requested condolences on his behalf. The association, considering that Martyr Meng sacrificed himself for the country and his family was impoverished, allocated 400 yuan for condolences.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Public Groups Telegraph to Request Halting of Production and Sales Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Public Association telegraphed: "To all Jiangxi public groups (fellow villagers) at home and abroad, as previously reported in Shen Bao, at the Jiangxi bandit suppression conference, someone proposed issuing a 3 million yuan post-disaster public bond. Our association believes that this matter concerns increasing the burden on the people and cannot be ignored. We have sent a telegram to the bandit suppression conference to request that this proposal be dropped and that all proposals regarding increasing the burden on the people should not be lightly proposed. We have also telegraphed to all public groups at home and abroad to request a unified position. We hope for your understanding. Later, we received a reply from the bandit suppression conference stating that our association held seven meetings and then closed, limited to reporting bandit information and discussing matters related to bandit suppression. There was no proposal to issue public bonds, and the report was untrue, etc. Our association is deeply gratified. Unexpectedly, the provincial government sent a proposal to establish a production and sales tax, which was rejected by the majority of votes. Later, the chairman re-proposed it and passed it by a counter-vote. The production and sales tax is a disguised likin. Establishing a production and sales tax is no different from restoring likin. Our province has suffered from banditry and natural disasters, and all industries are in decline. Even if the government cannot find ways to subsidize them, how can it arbitrarily collect taxes? It seems that ignoring the people's suffering and disregarding the law and proposing this case, even if it is formally passed, should not be implemented, let alone forced. Our association does not approve of this action. Your association cares about our hometown and has always been admired. What is your opinion on this matter? Please reply so that we can proceed together. We eagerly await your response. Jiangxi Public Association."</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grain Industry to Petition in Nanjing</h3>
<p>▲Abolish the Special Business Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai Oil Cake, Rice, Wheat, and Miscellaneous Grain Industries, due to Jiangsu Province's implementation of a special business tax, which changed the original business tax to a license tax, united with the six guilds to oppose it and submitted a petition to the municipal government to forward to the provincial government to immediately abolish it, and requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Executive Yuan to order its abolition. Yesterday, the guilds held a meeting at the Bean and Rice Industry Association. Chen Ziyi, the chairman, reported that the special business tax implemented by Jiangsu Province will be implemented on July 1st. It is now heard that checkpoints are being set up on land and water routes, and the deadline is approaching. Please come to the meeting to quickly find countermeasures. All the guilds believed that this kind of harsh tax and extortion was actually a disguised likin, which was difficult to bear. Now that the implementation date is only ten days away, please nominate representatives from various guilds to go to Nanjing to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to achieve the goal of abolishing it. After discussion, it was decided to invite each of the six guilds to nominate one or two representatives to go to Nanjing together to petition. Once the representatives of the various guilds are determined, they will set off immediately.</p>
<h3>Fifth District Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Yesterday Began to Investigate Households</p>
<p>▲Scheduled to End by the End of This Month</p>
<p>After our side took over the jurisdiction of each district in the Fifth District of Zhabei, the local order is still considered peaceful. However, due to the large number of residents and the mixed quality, it is deeply feared that bandits are hiding. Therefore, the Household Registration Investigation Office has begun strict investigations in separate groups and has decided to end them by the end of this month. All citizens living in the district, if there are any changes in the household population, must report and fill out a form before the deadline to exchange for an investigation certificate; otherwise, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Taicang Fellow Villagers Association</h3>
<p>Re-Requests the Establishment of Taicang as a Leading County</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province divides administrative regions, and old prefectural capitals are used to establish leading counties. Only Taicang, which should be established as a leading county, has been changed to Jiading. Therefore, the Taicang Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association on Hutai Road, Zhabei, believes that the measures are different and telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and prepared a memorandum, sending representatives to meet with Chairman Gu to request correction. Later, they received a provincial reply that it had been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record and could not be changed suddenly. Therefore, the association convened a meeting at about 4:00 PM yesterday and decided to submit it to the Executive Yuan again, earnestly requesting that it withdraw its order, re-designate Taicang as an administrative region, and establish a leading county. It is also known that various local agencies and organizations in the county are also sending telegrams to the provincial and executive courts to strive for the goal.</p>

<h3>Li Shijia of the Navy Departed for Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>▲Chen Jiliang Will Come to Shanghai and Enter Nanjing Soon</p>
<p>Li Shijia, the Permanent Vice Minister of the Navy Department, originally planned to take the Kinshaki Maru to Japan on the 18th to lead the Ninghai new warship back to China. Now, because the central government has not fully allocated the outstanding funds, Li also stopped going to Japan and had no need to stay in Shanghai. He took a special express train from the North Station to Nanjing at 11:00 PM last night to sort out departmental affairs. After the Ninghai debts are raised, he will go to Japan. In addition, Chen Jiliang, the Political Vice Minister, had previously requested to resign while suppressing bandits in Fujian, and the ministry ordered him to stay. However, Chen has not yet expressed his views on leaving or staying. Now, the Navy Department has important official business and telegraphed Chen to return to the ministry for consultation. After receiving the telegram, Chen has prepared to come to Shanghai from Xiamen and transfer to Nanjing and will arrive soon.</p>
<h3>Conversation with Members of the Rent Reduction Committee</h3>
<p>▲Correcting the Opinions of the Landlord Representatives</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reported that since the organization of the committee for the movement to reduce and exempt rent in this city began its work, it has aroused the deep attention of the citizens of the whole city. Even the government authorities also believe that it is reasonable. Therefore, it once summoned the representatives of landlords and owners to discuss specific measures at the city government meeting, as reported in the previous report. Yesterday, various newspapers published the opinion of the landlord representative, Pan Xulun, on reducing and exempting rent. In order to make all sectors understand the tenants' claims for reduction and exemption, the Dagong News Agency reporter specially visited Yu Hualong, a standing committee member of the Citizens' Rent Reduction and Exemption Movement Committee, yesterday and received his opinions. He said that the citizens' request for rent reduction and exemption is for the sake of the revival of the entire social economy and the market. For example, after the great earthquake in Japan, the Japanese government explicitly ordered the reduction and exemption of all land rents and taxes. Even recently, Beijing, Hangzhou, and other indirectly affected areas have also reduced and exempted rent for one month or half a month. Therefore, the citizens of this city, after suffering great losses directly, request rent reduction and exemption, which is a necessary action in accordance with law and reason. At the previous meeting of the city government to discuss with the representatives of tenants and landlords, the principle of rent exemption has been recognized, but the reduction of rent has not yet been mentioned. The opinion on rent reduction published in yesterday's newspaper by the landlord representative, Pan Xulun, believes that the reduction of rent is really not a problem, that is, rent reduction is an impossible thing. According to Pan's first point, in short, after the tenants move back, they have used the benefits and should not reduce the rent. It is found that the rent in each district is based on the prosperity and decline of the market. For example, the rent for the same city house varies by tens or hundreds of yuan due to the different areas. May I ask how much the commercial situation in Zhabei and other places has changed before and after the prosperity and decline? Therefore, although it has been used to benefit today, the market is depressed after the war, and business is deserted, and there may be no way to benefit. Therefore, how can the request for rent reduction be said to be impossible? Pan's second point, the tenants request rent reduction and exemption because of poor business or other war losses, thinking that relief is tantamount to adding the responsibility of the Japanese to the landlords, etc. If what Pan said is true, then the donations from all walks of life during the war amounted to tens of millions to relieve the refugees, wouldn't it be said that the responsibility for this Japanese incident lies in the hands of warm-hearted people from all walks of life and philanthropists? How laughable! In short, the citizens' request for rent reduction and exemption comes from a very abnormal state, and it is also to restore the prosperity of the market after the war, to adjust business and finance, not an unreasonable demand. I hope that the landlords will understand.</p>
<h3>Telephone Workers in the Concession</h3>
<p>Demand Company Reply Today</p>
<p>▲The Police Station Temporarily Implements Martial Law on Fujian Road</p>
<p>▲But the Latest News is that the Union Intends to Postpone</p>
<p>The telephone workers in the concession have been on strike for thirteen days. Although the automatic machine is barely communicating, the sound is low and turbid. All 3,000 workers were originally ordered to demonstrate to the company today. The Public Concession police station has also been ordered to temporarily implement martial law near Fujian Road. However, at 8:00 PM last night, the Strike Committee released news that the demonstration would be postponed. The various situations are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>▲Emergency Notice: After a meeting, the Strike Committee decided to request from all sectors: (1) That workers from all industries, students from all schools, and citizens from all over the city go to the Telephone Company on Fujian Road at 10:00 AM on the 20th to demand a reply to our demands from the company and oppose the increase in telephone prices; (2) That workers and students and citizens in Shanghai do their best to raise donations to help us, and issued an emergency notice saying, [For the announcement, it is scheduled for (tomorrow) Monday (at 10:00 AM) to go to the company on Fujian Road to demand a reply to the conditions. At that time, I hope that all our workers will be on time to assemble at the venue].</p>
<p>▲Police Martial Law: At 9:00 AM yesterday, the Strike Committee's presidium held a meeting to discuss all the preparations for the demonstration to the company on the 20th. Because the matter was important, it was decided to hold a general meeting of representatives at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. At that time, the meeting was aborted due to insufficient numbers. The Public Concession police authorities, fearing that thugs would mix in and cause trouble when the telephone workers demonstrated to the company, temporarily implemented martial law near Fujian Road this morning and increased the number of Chinese and Western detectives armed guards.</p>
<p>▲Workers' Attitude: A member of the Strike Committee told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday that after the telephone workers went on strike, the company had no sincerity to accept the conditions and colluded with the foremen to undermine our organization and refused our negotiations. All the workers were extremely angry. We have now decided on the following steps: (1) Expel those who violate discipline so that the group can deal with the outside world unanimously. If the capitalists do not accept our basic conditions, we will insist on a strike and at the same time ask all sectors for real help to make a long-term resistance; (2) All workers have decided to further work to promote the capitalists' awareness, and at the same time we hope that (1) all sectors will rise up to oppose the increase in telephone prices; (2) if workers can't bear it, and unfortunate actions occur and the Strike Committee cannot stop it, please forgive all sectors.</p>
<p>▲Disciplinary Meeting: The Disciplinary Team received a report that a part of the workers had been induced and planned to resume work today. At the same time, the company found that many telephone lines had been damaged due to the continuous rainy days and could not be repaired, and it would entrust the China Electric Company to work on its behalf. It held a joint meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday and resolved (1) If the workers of the China Electric Company replace the work, they will deal with it with severe measures; (2) Advise the workers not to be fooled.</p>
<p>▲Latest News: At 8:00 PM last night, the Strike Committee officially issued news that the demonstration would be postponed, saying, [The Telephone Strike Committee originally decided to send representatives to urge the capitalists to reply to the conditions and hold a demonstration movement today (Monday). Now that all sectors of Shanghai intend to unite with 3,000 telephone striking workers to take unified action and are making large-scale preparations, the Strike Committee decided to postpone the holding of the event today based on the steps taken by all sectors to assist the telephone strike].</p>
<h3>French Electric Workers' Demands</h3>
<p>Have Been Substantially Resolved</p>
<p>▲The Union Denies Rumors of a Strike</p>
<p>The entire workers of the mechanical department of the French Water and Electricity Company put forward three demands. After the council of the Second District Water and Electricity Industry Union sent Zou Dexin, Zhao Kunxiang, Lu Zhihong and others to negotiate with the new supervisor Gu Qiya at 5:00 PM on the 14th, it was heard that a substantial solution has now been obtained: (1) The company has accepted the case of requesting the company to restore the 200 yuan monthly allowance for union expenses; (2) Issue them on a monthly basis as usual; (3) As for the 21 workers who were suspended by the company due to the switch conflict on September 5 last year, the company agreed to consider ways to deal with it; (3) The case of Xu Amei, the former standing director of the union, is now under appeal, and it is expected that the sentence may be reduced, so the dispute can be resolved. The union has solemnly denied the various rumors circulating, such as the French electric workers brewing a strike and implementing a strike.</p>
<h3>British Consul General Dunlop Was Buried Yesterday</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News stated that Dunlop, the Deputy Consul of the British Consulate General, was injured in a car accident on the way to the theater with friends on the evening of the 8th of this month and died of his injuries, passing away at the Hong'en Hospital yesterday (the 18th) at the young age of 27. Dunlop came to China around 1927 and served at the British Consulate in Peiping for two years. In the spring of 1930, he was transferred to the Shanghai Consulate General, serving in the China Affairs Section. He was a handsome young man and had not yet married. Everyone who heard of this unfortunate disaster mourned him. This afternoon, he was buried in the Hongqiao Cemetery. It is said that our municipal government and consuls of various countries sent representatives to attend the funeral.</p>
<h3>Hongkou War-Era Liquor License Fees</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Agrees to Reduce Them</p>
<p>▲Taxpayers' Association Relays to Various Organizations in Hongkou</p>
<p>The Joint Office of Various Business and People's Organizations in the Hongkou District previously sent a letter to the Taxpayers' Association requesting the exemption of liquor license fees in the area during the war, requesting the Municipal Council to exempt them. Now, the Taxpayers' Association has replied, saying that it would be opened to the address and allowed to be handled at its discretion. According to the letter, the association forwarded it to the Joint Office of Various Organizations in Hongkou District, saying: "With respect, regarding the request to exempt liquor license fees in the Hongkou area during the war period, this association has repeatedly forwarded the letter to the Municipal Council for handling. Now, we have received a reply from the Municipal Council, translated as follows: 'Your letters of May 25 and June 2 were received, forwarding the request of various liquor merchants in Hongkou to exempt various license fees during the Shanghai war and protesting that the fee collectors were accompanied by patrol officers, which was considered intimidation. This bureau's implementation of the relief plan treats liquor merchants and other merchants equally. Now, because the liquor merchants seem to have some misunderstandings, the method of collecting license fees is explained as follows: For those who have not paid the license fees for the spring and summer seasons, the fee collectors will go to collect them first. If the fee payers cannot pay them at the time, the fee collectors shall not collect all of them, but only submit the case to the fee office for verification. The fee office shall reduce it according to the relief plan during the period when the fee payers stop operating. At present, the license fees of the liquor merchants have not been considered and reduced, which is still the first time that this bureau has received requests for relief from the industry. Now, please provide the addresses of the liquor merchants listed below, and we will handle them appropriately according to the individual circumstances. As for the matter of the fee collectors being accompanied by patrol officers, the patrol officers are part of the personnel for collecting license fees from peddlers and have nothing to do with the liquor stores. The personnel were assigned to collect liquor merchant license fees only a few days after the number of peddler license fees collected was slightly reduced. The patrol officers were only used to deal with peddlers who evaded fees. In order to avoid misunderstandings in the future, when the peddler fee collectors temporarily undertake other official duties, they will not be allowed to be accompanied by patrol officers. In response to the letter, please refer to it and send the detailed list of addresses and house numbers of the liquor merchants to the association for transfer and handling. Sincerely, '"</p>
<h3>Rise in European Sales of White Filature Silk</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, due to the previous effort to relieve the silk mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, organized a committee to sort out the outdated silk and cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The committee has been working separately, and the outdated silk and cocoons held by silk and cocoon merchants have all been registered in accordance with the regulations and are being inspected. It is understood that the committee has completed the inspection of the outdated cocoons. However, the inspection of the outdated silk is slightly more complicated because most silk merchants have mortgaged their stored silk to the financial sector. Currently, only about twenty to thirty percent have been inspected. It is expected that all inspections will be completed by the end of this month at the latest. Recently, however, there has been a turnaround in the European sales of white filature silk, and silk prices have risen. The effect of the government's reorganization efforts is now somewhat evident.</p>
<h3>First Special Court</h3>
<p>Strict Prohibition Against Court Runners Extorting Money</p>
<p>Zhou Xianjue, the president of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, issued a notice yesterday stating: "Regarding the matter of notifying, delivering, and sending litigation documents by this court, all fees that should be collected from the parties involved are marked with the amount on the documents and collected accordingly, with receipts issued as proof. No extra money is allowed to be taken. This has always been the rule, but it is feared that the court runners may become lax over time and lightly attempt to demand extra money from the parties involved. Strict prevention is necessary to reduce the burden of litigation. Therefore, this notice is issued. If any party encounters a court runner demanding extra money in the future, they are allowed to immediately report the matter to the court, and once verified, severe punishment will be imposed without leniency. Be informed accordingly."</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Association of Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) Members</h3>
<p>Opposing the Opium Monopoly</p>
<p>▲ Appeal to All Sectors</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of YMCA members in Shanghai sent a telegram to all sectors yesterday in response to the opium monopoly protest. The telegram stated: "[To the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association and all groups and compatriots across the country: Before the foreign invasion is quelled, internal strife suddenly arises. Alas, our people are in dire straits with no one to turn to. Yet the central government is not planning to make a fresh start with the people but frequently engages in oppressive measures such as seizing melons and holding onto stems. It callously intends to implement an opium monopoly, not just several times, but with hundreds of schemes and tricks. Recently, according to various sources, we know that the central government will achieve the opium monopoly at any cost. Although the responsible authorities have repeatedly stated to the outside world, hoping to cover it up, how can traces be completely hidden? The authorities have such intentions, how can the people have a chance to live? Unexpectedly, our people will not die from the floods and ferocious beasts of the communists, nor will they die from the brutal Japanese invaders, but will be led to death by the authorities' opium monopoly policy. Is this something our people expected? Thinking about it, we are terrified. Looking to the future, it is as dark as ink. Please, your association, lead the masses to fight to the death. If we delay, we will not be able to remedy it. Our association, knowing that it is too late to add fuel to the fire, what else can we say? We are willing to join the end of the line of all of you, and join the anti-drug sincerity. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of YMCA members bows and prints.]"</p>

<h3>Acting Chief Inspector</h3>
<p>Macdonald Applies for Leave and Leaves Shanghai</p>

<h3>The Joint Office of Postal Workers Is Sealed</h3>
<p>The Postal Workers' Union issued a message stating that since the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union resumed work last time, it was discovered that nine former members of the union, including Xing Rongzhao and Sun Hanliang, were induced and hired by a certain party, hoping to undermine the national postal protection movement. Subsequently, the fourth representative conference of the ninth session of the union resolved to expel them from the union forever. However, Xing and others did not know how to repent and recently induced two or three scoundrels to set up a so-called joint office in the name of the various branches and special groups of the union without authorization. The various branches and special groups of the union successively published statements in the newspapers and reported the matter to the union for investigation. However, Xing and others turned a deaf ear and even tried to deceive the party and government organs for the record. The Municipal Party Department found out that this deformed organization was not only legally unfounded but also violated the central government's circular. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Municipal Government ordering the Public Security Bureau to seal it off yesterday (the 18th) at 8:00 PM. It is said that before the pseudo-joint office was sealed, there was news of the seal, so when it was sealed, the main figures such as Xing Rongzhao, Tu Heyun, and Sun Hanliang, and more than ten others, all fled. A certain party official, Mr. Tang, who was specially dispatched to command, left Shanghai after the incident, and his whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shangyi</h3>
<p>Received Extortion Letters Last Year As Well</p>
<p>▲ More Than Ten Letters</p>
<p>▲ The Wording Was Very Strong</p>
<p>▲ This Year's Extortion Letter</p>
<p>▲ The Bandits Have Already Admitted It</p>
<p>Zhang Shangyi, the Chinese Inspector of the General Police Department, lives at No. 123 Chengdu Road. Recently, he received eight threatening letters from gangsters, intending to extort 5,000 yuan, and asked to meet on Rue Edouard. Zhang reported the matter to the police. Lu Liankui, the Chief Detective of the General Investigation Department, and detectives Wang Chengying and Wu Changkai disguised themselves and arrested the extortionist bandits Kan Wenda, Wang Shuping, and Wu Zhanlin. They were sent to the First Special District Court for detention, which was approved. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The police have now formally prosecuted the three criminals. The lawyer of the police department, Wang Yaotang, stated the case, saying that the police are prosecuting the three defendants for attempted extortion, but the articles may need to be changed in the future, because the victim is now in court, and it should be asked whether he has suffered any financial losses and mental pain. The police have ordered the first defendant, Kan Wenda, to write a confession in his own hand regarding the threatening letters received by the victim, but the confession is not to prove the defendant's crime, but to facilitate checking the handwriting on the threatening letters. It has now been identified by the appraiser that the handwriting on the first, third, fourth, and sixth threatening letters received by the plaintiff is the same as the handwriting left by the defendant at the police station. The seventh and eighth letters were identified as written by Wang Shuping. However, the plaintiff also received many anonymous letters in the previous year and last year, but did not report them to the police at the time. Therefore, he requested that the case be postponed so that the letters received before and after could be identified to see if they were written by the same person. Then, the plaintiff Zhang Shangyi testified that he is a local, 37 years old, and the Inspector of the General Investigation Department. From the 21st of last month to the 10th of this month, he successively received as many as eight threatening letters, signed by Li Jianhong, hoping to extort 5,000 yuan. When he received the second letter, he reported it to the police and started the investigation. It was not until recently that it was cracked. However, he did not lose any money. However, since receiving the threatening letters, he did not know whether the purpose of the bandits was only money or if they also wanted lives. Therefore, he stepped up his preparations. He also hired bodyguards for his son to study every day, and the gate was strictly guarded. The three defendants in this case are all strangers, and he does not know why they are threatening him. He also received more than ten anonymous letters last year, and the wording was more intense, but there was no contact location, so he did not report it to the police. When questioned, Kan Wenda admitted that he wrote the threatening letters, but he did not know how many letters Wang Shuping wrote. After verifying the confession, Judge Wu ordered the defendants to be detained for further interrogation in seven days, and ordered the appraiser Mei Tai to submit an appraisal report to the court for verification.</p>

<h3>Hollywood Photo Studio</h3>
<p>The Manager Commits Suicide by Poisoning</p>
<p>▲ Frequent Contact with a Girlfriend</p>
<p>▲ The Wife Found It Difficult to Understand</p>
<p>▲ An Argument the Night Before</p>
<p>▲ Took Poison This Morning and Died</p>
<p>A local man named Qu Shunqing, also known as Chengxiang, 31 years old, lived at No. 418 Qujia Lane, Beijing Road. He was wealthy and worked as a photographer and manager at the Hollywood Photo Studio at No. 1632 North Sichuan Road for more than a year. Qu went to the studio around 8:00 AM every morning and did not return home until 7:00 or 8:00 PM. He was used to it. Qu handled everything in the studio, big or small, so Hollywood's meager reputation was all due to Qu's efforts. Recently, Qu had a girlfriend who he frequently interacted with, and their relationship was very close. However, good things are often disturbed, and the secret was not kept. Qu's wife, Zhang, found out. Zhang and this woman were also close friends, and jealousy arose, causing a fierce quarrel. Yesterday afternoon, Zhang went to Sincere Company to shop alone. In a narrow encounter, she met the woman again on the way. Then, her jealousy flared up again, and she suspected that her husband Qu Shunqing was traveling with the woman. Upon seeing Zhang, she slipped away into the crowd. After finishing her shopping, she returned home leisurely and wept under the covers. When Qu returned home in the evening, she began to roar and interrogate Qu severely, scolding him at will. Qu was also stubborn and retorted, explaining that he had been working in the studio all day and had not gone anywhere else, but he still could not make her understand. A quarrel continued until dawn. Qu left the house at 7:30 and hired a car to the photo studio. After sitting for a while, he went out and bought a large bottle of calming medicine called Sommons at a nearby pharmacy. He returned to the studio and swallowed it secretly. Around 9:00 AM, the medicine took effect. Colleagues saw that his expression was depressed and his eyes were fixed. Knowing that he had taken poison, they sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, the treatment was ineffective, and he died miserably half an hour later. The studio immediately ordered someone to notify his family. When his wife arrived at the hospital, his soul had long since returned to the Great Luo Heaven. Later, the hospital transferred the body to the autopsy room for examination.</p>
<h3>Traitor Fight</h3>
<p>▲ All Sent to the High Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>Liu Asan and Liu Jinbiao, both from Jiangbei, were traitors during the Shanghai war. Recently, due to uneven distribution of spoils, Liu Asan went to the Second Precinct of the Fifth District to accuse Liu Jinbiao of being a Japanese spy during the war, wearing the armband of the sun flag, and seizing three boxes, ordering Liu Asan to send them to the concession by rickshaw. The precinct arrested Liu Jinbiao and, together with Liu Asan, sent them to the local court. Prosecutor Yang opened a preliminary hearing. Liu Jinbiao confessed that Liu Asan had the symbol of the Japanese headquarters, so he transported goods for the enemy in Zhabei, taking the opportunity to rob things. He also said that Liu Asan had taken a large piece of tin from him. The prosecutor believed that both of them were traitors and major criminals who subverted the Republic of China, so they were both detained and sent to the High Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Debt Collection Leads to Death</h3>
<p>▲ Wife Dies, Husband Injured... The Murderer Is on the Run</p>
<p>Ye Daxing, a native of Ningbo, 48 years old, worked as a chief steward for a Westerner at the Ewo Cotton Mill and rented a room at No. 88 Xinkang Lane, Yangshupu Road. He was a second landlord. His tenant, Chen Yongsheng, a native of Pudong, 35 years old, was in the sack business. Last year, Chen borrowed 40 yuan from Ye to buy sacks, promising to repay it within ten days. However, he has not repaid it to this day. At around 8:00 PM last night, Daxing's wife (42 years old), Zhang, demanded the arrears from Chen, and an argument broke out. Ye happened to be nearby trying to mediate. Who knew that Chen would become angry out of shame and rush into the kitchen to grab a kitchen knife and slash Zhang's left neck and left face with one knife, killing her on the spot. Ye's left neck was also slashed with a knife, leaving a wound about half an inch deep, and blood flowed all over the ground. The murderer, seeing the disaster he had caused, fled outside without a trace. Afterwards, the neighbors summoned a patrol officer, who used a fire truck to send the body and the injured person to Tongren Hospital. The injured person was hospitalized for treatment, and the body was immediately transferred to the autopsy room to await a report to the court for examination.</p>
<h3>Picking Up Old Goods and Finding a Bomb</h3>
<p>▲ A Ten-Year-Old Child Is Killed by the Explosion</p>
<p>▲ Three Other People Are Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Wu, a native of Jiangbei who lived in a bungalow at No. 505 Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai, made a living by selling old goods. He had two sons, the eldest named Binrui, 19 years old, and the youngest named Xingshou, 10 years old, who assisted his father in the family business at home. The day before yesterday (the 17th), Wu collected a large batch of old iron somewhere and transported it home by car. Yesterday morning after 7:00 AM, Wu had other business to do and went to negotiate in person. Before leaving, he still told his eldest son, Binrui, to sort out the goods received yesterday. Who knew that at 0:30 PM, a round object covered with iron was found in the old iron basket. Xingshou, being young and ignorant, held an iron hammer and knocked it randomly. There was a loud bang that shook the house. Xingshou's right hand was blown off on the spot, and his body was burned. His brother, Binrui, was injured in his hands, feet, and chest. Two neighboring children were also affected. Wang Xiaogouzi (11 years old) was injured in his right leg, and Chen Donghai (11 years old) was injured in his buttocks. Afterwards, Chinese patrol officer No. 283 from the Putuo Road police station arrived and sent the four children to Renji Hospital for treatment. Wu Xingshou died at 4:30 PM due to his severe injuries.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Fire Brigade</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Hold a Memorial Service for Seniors and a General Assembly</p>

<h3>Tax Collector Arrests Township Head</h3>
<p>▲ Causes Township Heads to Resign</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau has recently received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department to strictly urge the collection of accumulated land taxes from previous years. The bureau immediately ordered the tax collectors in each district to urge the collection by a deadline. Dai Xueting, the head of Huibei Township in the First District of Minhang County, also had arrears during the busy Cao period, which had not been paid off. Cheng Gentang, the tax collector of the district, demanded payment from him. Dai paid some first and said that he would pay the rest after receiving it from the flower households. However, Cheng said that the bureau was urging the payment urgently and that it must be paid off, which led to a dispute. Cheng arrested Dai and detained him at the County Public Security First Branch. When Wu Shifang, the district head, learned of this, he went to the Public Security Bureau to provide bail for his release. Unexpectedly, all the township heads in the district were very angry about this. They all believed that township heads were local autonomous civil servants and that the township head had high moral character. The tax collector arrested him without authorization, which showed that he intended to insult them. In the future, all township heads would be in danger. Therefore, they resigned to the district office one after another. Wu, the district head, repeatedly comforted the township heads and asked them to continue to work as usual. At the same time, he sent letters to the Finance Bureau and the County Government yesterday, requesting that the official Cheng Gentang be dismissed and punished to serve as a warning against illegal behavior.</p>
<h3>After Tongtai Yong Was Bombed</h3>
<p>Involved in a Lawsuit with the Insurance Company for Compensation</p>
<p>▲ The Insurance Company Is Represented by a German Merchant</p>
<p>Tongtai Yong Hardware and Liquor Store on Seward Road in Hongkou had previously insured against fire for 10,000 taels of silver with the German merchant Selehia Insurance Company through Hequn Business Company. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the store was bombed by the Japanese army on February 2nd. Afterwards, it negotiated with Hequn for compensation, but no solution was reached. Tongtai Yong then sued Hequn Business Company in the First Special District Local Court. During the court hearing, Hequn's lawyer, Shen Yuesheng, raised the issue of the subject of the lawsuit and was ordered to submit a detailed defense for review. As reported in previous newspapers, Shen has now listed the facts and reasons for the defense in a statement submitted to the court, which mainly states that the defendant, Hequn Company, is a representative agent, and it used the qualification of representative agent when underwriting the plaintiff's fire insurance, signing on behalf of Selehia Company. According to the rules listed on the insurance policy, the representative agent is not responsible for the company's litigation behavior or other investigation behaviors. Moreover, Selehia Company has sent Mr. Xuenate as its representative in Shanghai. The plaintiff can negotiate with the representative. Furthermore, according to the regulations in the insurance policy, if the insured property is damaged due to military action, the insurer is not responsible for any compensation. The insured house in this case has been certified by an official letter from the Japanese consulate, which proves that it was set on fire and destroyed due to the war between the Japanese army and the Chinese plainclothes troops. Since the plaintiff did not insure against war disasters, it cannot demand compensation for damages. Moreover, the plaintiff has not accurately proven the extent of the damage. In short, the plaintiff's lawsuit is completely based on the insurance contract and demands compensation, which of course cannot be separated from the contract itself, otherwise it will be unfounded. Now, if according to the contract, the defendant's subject is not qualified, the plaintiff cannot bear the burden of proof, and its damage compensation is even more without reason according to the contract. The plaintiff's far-fetched misunderstanding cannot force the insurer to bear the responsibility for risks outside the contract. Moreover, the defendant is not a party within the contract, so the plaintiff's request clearly has no right of litigation. It is requested that it be rejected. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao summoned both parties again, and the lawyers from both sides debated, but it was still not concluded and a continuation hearing is needed on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Amusement Tickets Discovered at Tianyun Building</h3>
<p>▲ No Difference from the Real Ones</p>
<p>▲ The Court Will Investigate in Detail</p>
<p>Zhang A'gen, a native of Wenzhou, was selling many amusement tickets for Tianyun Building of Wing On Company at the entrance of the building. Chang Renjun, the doorman of the building, discovered that the amusement tickets sold by Zhang were counterfeit, so he arrested him, confiscated 36 counterfeit tickets, and handed them over to Chinese Detective Zhu Shanghe, who took them to the Old Gate Police Station. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the case, saying that the paper and color of the amusement tickets held by the defendant were no different from the real ones, but the Chinese characters "Shanghai" on the seal on the back of the tickets were smaller on the counterfeit tickets than on the real tickets, so it could be distinguished. Then, Yu Ziming, a representative of Tianyun Building, filed a case, explaining the differences between the counterfeit amusement tickets and the real ones, and immediately presented a real ticket to the court. When questioned, the defendant Zhang A'gen confessed that the amusement tickets were purchased from Xiao Cai, a tea waiter in the building, and were not counterfeit. The presiding judge, Feng Shide, then reviewed the real ticket and the counterfeit tickets presented to the court and discovered that the Chinese characters "Shanghai" on the real ticket were completely the same as those on the counterfeit tickets, and there was no difference in the paper and color. It was really necessary to conduct a detailed investigation, so he ordered the case to be postponed, ordering the responsible personnel of Tianyun Building to come to the court to testify and bring the seal for verification to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Poor and Sick, Commits Suicide by Hanging</h3>
<p>▲ Yang Gengqing Is Pitiful</p>
<p>Yang Gengqing, a native of Chongming, 38 years old, worked as a tea and food steward at a tea and food shop at No. 113 Rue de la Mission in the French Concession. He suffered from malaria for a long time and repeatedly sought treatment from doctors, but it was rarely effective. He relapsed recently, but he was poor and unable to afford medical treatment. Unable to bear the torment of the disease, he suddenly had suicidal thoughts. The night before last, he hanged himself on the staircase outside his bedroom. It was not until 6:30 AM yesterday that his colleagues got up to work and discovered him. They untied him to rescue him, but his body was already cold and there was no way to bring him back to life. The shop reported the matter to the police station, which sent a detective to transfer the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch to await a report to the Second Special District Court for an autopsy. Meanwhile, someone was sent to notify the family of the deceased to come to Shanghai to collect the body.</p>
<h3>Wang Yasuo</h3>
<p>Settlement of the Case Against Ding Arong for Abandonment</p>
<p>A woman named Wang Yasuo, also known as A Da, residing at 868 Connaught Road, recently filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court through attorney Li Kui against Ding Arong, who opened the San Yi Rubber Company on Gordon Road, accusing him of abduction and abandonment. The grounds for the lawsuit were as follows: The plaintiff is a weak woman, without parents or siblings. The defendant, Ding Arong, is of a cunning nature. After the plaintiff's mother passed away, he conspired with Zhou Gengsheng to come to the residence of Wang Genquan, with whom the plaintiff was living, pretending to be friendly. Although the plaintiff was 31 years old and determined not to marry, he used sweet words and flattery to seduce her. He also used deceptive means, claiming he had no wife and wished to form a lifelong alliance. The plaintiff, being a woman, was weak-willed and was eventually lured to open a room. From then on, the door was open, and she became pregnant. The defendant frequently visited the plaintiff's home to cohabitate and borrowed over a thousand silver dollars' worth of jewelry. However, recently, as the plaintiff's savings were depleted, the defendant became distant and avoided meeting her. When urged to fulfill their promise of formal cohabitation, he, with malicious intent, continued to delay with lies until the day before she gave birth. In a critical situation, she had no choice but to have relatives take her to the defendant's residence, hoping for a safe delivery. Unexpectedly, instead of providing proper care, he incited his family and neighbors to beat her. Faced with this violence, the plaintiff had no choice but to go to the hospital to give birth and then file a lawsuit. As expected, the next day, she gave birth to a son and demanded living expenses, but he heartlessly refused. Such abduction and abandonment forced her to file a lawsuit, demanding the return of the thousand-plus silver dollars' worth of jewelry he had swindled and the payment of ten thousand dollars for the child's upbringing and education. Ding Arong also filed a counterclaim through his lawyer. The case was initially heard by the court the other day. However, since Ding Arong was willing to settle out of court, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant attended the hearing. It is reported that the settlement agreement was signed yesterday at attorney Li Kui's office, and both parties have withdrawn their lawsuits from the court.</p>
<h3>A Moment's Mistake, Eternal Regret</h3>
<p>▲ A Couple Quarreling, Attempting Suicide by Drowning, Rescued</p>
<p>▲ Seeking Relatives, Unable to Find Them, Forced into Sexual Assault</p>
<p>A young woman named Ma Wu, from Nanjing, is 25 years old. Her husband, Ma Xiejian, runs a shoe business in Xinximen, Zhenjiang. Recently, her husband took a concubine, which worsened their relationship. This escalated into abuse. Unable to bear the suffering, Wu attempted suicide by drowning before the Dragon Boat Festival. She was rescued by a life-saving boat and taken to a Buddhist nunnery to temporarily reside. A neighboring woman named Hao Yan (currently residing in the Longhua Town Cement Factory, running a pancake shop) returned from Shanghai to Nanjing. Being friends with Wu, she went to visit her and learned of the situation. Hao Yan repeatedly consoled her, stating that she was still young and should not take her own life. She suggested Wu go to Shanghai to work and earn a living, providing her Shanghai address. However, before Hao Yan returned to Shanghai, Wu had already arrived alone in Shanghai. She visited the address, but Hao Yan's husband, Hao Wenmao, unable to accommodate her since there were no women in the house, sent Wu to reside with Zhao Su at 18 Xiangjia Residence nearby. Zhao had a son named Zhao Chuanbi, 27 years old, working as a doorman somewhere, and unmarried. The other day, Chuanbi returned home, seeing Wu as young and vulnerable, he seduced her with sweet words, then brandished a knife, threatening her. Despite Wu's firm refusal, she was helpless and unable to resist and was sexually assaulted. Only the other day did she escape. Meeting a cement factory worker named Li Dongyang, Wu told him what happened, and temporarily left her clothes and shoes at Li's house. She then went to a sock factory in Shanghai to find her sister. Later, Zhao discovered that Ma Wu was hiding at Li's place and gathered a crowd to break down the door, ransacking the place. Li Dongyang reported this to the Longhua Sub-Bureau. The police took Zhao Su and Zhao Chuanbi to the station for questioning. Zhao Su also accused Li Dongyang of seducing Ma Wu and sending white pigeons, etc. While questioning, Ma Wu voluntarily turned herself in, confessing what happened. Director Liu, finding conflicting statements, sent the plaintiff Li Dongyang, the defendants Zhao Su and Zhao Chuanbi, the runaway Ma Wu, and the witnesses Hao Wenmao and Hao Yan to the bureau for further investigation.</p>

They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, pending further hearing. Li Wang confessed that Li Helin was an accomplice, and he was to be arrested. Yesterday, he was sent to the High Court First Division. Attorney Zhang Tianyin stated that the arrest of the defendant in this case was due to his turning himself in. Li had come to the police station claiming that his two children had been abducted and had not been found. He heard that the police station had rescued many kidnapped children and wanted to see if his two children were among them. The jail warden allowed him to inspect the children. Li claimed that his children were not among them. However, Li Wang identified him, stating that before the case was solved, he had brought two children to her. He was arrested and detained. He is now requested to be interrogated together with Wang Xi and others. Judge Shen briefly questioned Li and ordered him detained pending further interrogation.</p>

Four robbers, all wearing blue cloth short coats and speaking the Anhui dialect, each armed with a Browning pistol, knocked on the front door. They first used their guns to intimidate them, forbidding them from making a sound. Then, they tied up the family members one by one and placed them in a room, then began their search unhindered. They stole 32 paper dollars, 28 silver dollars, a gold bracelet, a gold ring, a gold ring with inlaid gemstones, a pair of gold earrings, a silk long gown of various sizes, and a raincoat.

However, recently, fishermen from outside have been netting fish in the newly opened river, causing the water flow to slow down and silt to accumulate. If this is not prohibited promptly, previous efforts will be wasted. In addition, some ignorant people are planting reeds or privately building docks in the river, encroaching on the riverbed and hindering water conservancy. They requested a strict prohibition. After receiving the report, the County Government approved the request and instructed the local public security bureaus along the river to strictly prohibit the aforementioned activities at all times to maintain water conservancy.</p>

<h3>Domestically Produced Rubber Cement</h3>

<h3>Expansion of Huazhang Electro-Engraving Company</h3>

<h3>A Preface to the Supplement to "Shuowen Gu Lin" by Jiang Zhulin</h3>
<p>The Zhou official "Baoshi" taught the sons of the nation the six scripts; Confucius established education and listed writing as one of the Six Arts. During the Han Dynasty, the imperial historian tested students, and those who could recite over 9,000 characters were qualified to be historians. The importance of knowing characters has been emphasized since ancient times. After Xu Shen authored the "Shuowen Jiezi" in fourteen chapters, compiling the great achievements of seal script and great seal script, character study gradually became a distinct field of learning. From the Two Jin Dynasties to the Sui and Tang Dynasties, there were authors in each era, all continuing the work of Xu Shen. Later, Xu's scholarship declined, and Xu Xuan and Xu Kai collated and corrected the "Shuowen." Their versions became popular, and Xu's scholarship revived. From the mid-Song Dynasty to the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, it declined again. During the Qianlong and Jiaqing reigns of the Qing Dynasty, scholars used phonology and exegesis to collate and correct the classics, and Xu's scholarship reached its peak for a time. Among those who studied the "Shuowen," Duan Yucai of Jintan was considered the most erudite. After Duan, there were hundreds of scholars who specialized in this study, but their writings were vast, like a sea of smoke. How could scholars easily read them all? My friend Ding Zhonghu (Zihou), aware of this, spent thirty years of his energy to collect the writings on Xu's scholarship and compiled the "Shuowen Jiezi Gu Lin" in one thousand and thirty-six volumes. After its publication, it became popular for a time. Its value has already been recognized by the world, and there is no need for me to add unnecessary words. Ding Zihou still felt it was not enough. In recent years, he has earnestly searched for more books and compiled a supplement to the "Gu Lin" in one hundred and seventy volumes, including: annotations on the older version of Xu's book and collations of characters and phrases; annotations on the newer version of Xu's book and collations of characters and phrases; studies and corrections of Duan's annotations; miscellaneous interpretations and separate accounts; citations of classics; explanations of certain characters or phrases; studies of inscriptions on bronze and stone, and oracle bone script; and a supplement of omitted characters. The book is about to be published, and he asked me to write a preface. I have observed that his supplement is not only comprehensive but also contains many rare books from within the country. For example, Zhu Shiduan's "Shuowen Jiaoding Ben" (Collated Version of the Shuowen), of which only two volumes were published in the "Chunyu Lou Congshu" (Spring Rain Tower Collection). Ding Zihou has now found the original manuscript of four volumes, adding two volumes to the already published two volumes, so that readers can fully see Zhu's work. Another example is the "Zhuanzhu" (derivative characters) among the six scripts. The interpretations of it have been varied and inconsistent throughout history. Only Xia Xin's "Liushu Zhuanzhu Shuo" (On Derivative Characters in the Six Scripts) in two volumes uniquely realized that Xu Shu-zhong's idea of "establishing categories with a head, receiving each other with the same meaning" refers to the division of the "Shuowen" into sections. Verified by Xu's preface and postscript, his theory is in accord with the facts. Thus, the meaning of "Zhuanzhu" is greatly clarified. Xia's book was published in the "Jingzi Tang Quanji" (Complete Works of Jingzi Hall), but it is now rarely circulated. Ding Zihou painstakingly sought and copied it, which is of great benefit to scholars. Furthermore, Wang Tingding's "Shuowen Yizi Jishuo" (Collected Explanations of Missing Characters in the Shuowen) in four volumes is also a rare book. In modern times, there are two types of "missing characters" in the "Shuowen": one is characters "derived from a certain sound," and the other is characters that are mentioned in the explanations but not found in the standard seal script. These are all considered "missing." Since Yan Kejun's "Shuowen Jiaoyi" (Collated Discussions on the Shuowen) and Wang Yun's "Shuowen Shili" (Examples of Explanations in the Shuowen) initiated this trend, later scholars have supplemented over 330 "missing characters," almost matching the number of variant characters. Wang Tingding alone had a unique insight, believing that Xu's book was originally based on small seal script, and that the radicals were often ancient seal scripts that had been abandoned, while the explanations were based on the popular clerical script of the Han Dynasty. The characters not found in the standard seal script were either ancient seal scripts or clerical script. The non-clerical script were vulgar characters that should not have been in the "Shuowen," so each character was briefly explained to prove that only a few characters were truly missing from Xu's book. The rest each had a corresponding character in small seal script and were not actually missing. His theory is very accurate and can serve as a guiding principle for later scholars. Other examples include He Shou Zhang's "Su Gan Shi Du Shuowen Xiaoshi" (Brief Notes on Reading the Shuowen in the Su Gan Studio) in one volume, Lin Changyi's "Yan Xiang Xulu Lun Shuowen" (Records of the Inkstone Box Discussing the Shuowen) in one volume, Wu Shanshu's "Shuowen Guangyi Jiaoding" (Collated and Corrected Shuowen Guangyi) in three volumes, Wu Chu's "Shuowen Ranzhi" (Touching the Shuowen) in two volumes, Xie Chanhua's "Shuowen Wenzai" (Records of Hearing about the Shuowen) in two volumes, and Zhang Xingfu's "Shuowen Fayu" (Doubts about the Shuowen), volume 7, all of which are rare books by Qing Dynasty scholars of Xu's scholarship. As for the ninth category, "explanations of certain characters or phrases," they were obtained by carefully combing through various complete works or collections, and the diligence is especially admirable. When I was sixteen or seventeen, I read Zeng Guofan's family letters and learned that the world had so-called studies of moral principles, textual criticism, and literary composition. I immediately rejected the imperial examinations and wanted to follow Zeng's theory, using the textual criticism of Jiang, Dai, Duan, and Wang as the writing style of Ban, Yang, Zuo, and Guo. Therefore, I briefly engaged in elementary school, aiming at literature, without fully understanding the original meaning of textual criticism. In middle age, I abandoned literature and emphasized moral principles, having no time for deep study. Now that I am getting old, my learning is barren. Reading Ding's book, I feel that the ancients' saying that reading should start with discussing characters is something I still regret not having done.

<p>Two or Three Things</p>
<h3>A Florist's Song of Praise</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>It was probably more than twenty years ago. At that time, girls' schools were just budding. Once a girl became a student, she had a kind of simple youthfulness. She would casually tie a cool knot in her hair, without using hair oil or ornaments. Her clothes were free of silk and embroidery, especially valuing naturalness and avoiding makeup. Therefore, in the eyes of ignorant and fashionable women at the time, girl students were just a group of little old women!</p>
<p>The trend of girl students towards becoming little old women created a hostile relationship with the florists, who suffered a heavy blow! I remember one florist frowning and saying to me:</p>
<p>"As girls' schools develop day by day, those of us who make a living from cosmetics are affected day by day! I'm afraid that in ten years, florists will have to close down, and in twenty years, the word 'cosmetics' will become a historical term!"</p>
<p>Who would have thought that he was so wrong! Twenty years later, this owner has had good fortune, with profits tripled. The florist he runs has a total of three locations, and the business in each is not bad. He said to me with a smiling face: "In the twenty years since, education has progressed, and the cosmetics business has also progressed along with it. Not only have the girl students who take cosmetics as their lives become loyal customers, but even male students like it much more than before. Stanley's Camphor Cream and Snow Powder are even more important than textbooks and educational supplies! Therefore, our business is booming! Male and female students are our bread and butter! Long live education! Long live male and female students!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, I had a question:</p>
<p>"While the cosmetics business has certainly progressed, has education really progressed? Florist's bread and butter, please give me a verdict!"</p>
<h3>Fudan After the War</h3>
<p>— Wu Chengda</p>
<p>Someone has already talked about Jinan University after the war. Let me talk about our Fudan.</p>
<p>Fudan University faces Xiangyin Road in front and Ye City Road in the back. There are many buildings, including [Zibin Yuan], [Jian Gong Tang], [Xianzhou Library], and dozens of dormitories for male and female students. This time, the Japanese army occupied Jiangwan and used the school as its headquarters, so it was not bombed. It was also fortunate in misfortune.</p>
<p>However, the parts in each room were destroyed, especially in the Zibin Yuan, the school's office building. Not a single chair, table, wall, or partition was intact. Fortunately, the important books in the Xianzhou Library were taken out early, and only the window sills were damaged.</p>
<p>The students suffered the greatest losses this time. Just the suits and books alone were a considerable loss. One Cantonese student even lost more than two thousand yuan, which is even more shocking. Nothing was left in the Liangyou and school dormitories. Only the Yidun dormitory, because it was farther from the school, was not affected by the robbery. It was both fortunate and unfortunate.</p>
<p>There was no one in the East Palace (female dormitory). The doors were tightly closed. The curtains in the bedrooms were mostly old and torn. Compared with the richness and splendor of the past, one can't help but feel the pang of [this is one time, that is another time].</p>
<p>There were police stationed at the front and back gates to provide protection. Access was quite strict.</p>
<p>From the racecourse to the school, there were more than a hundred rickshaws with fixed fares (twelve copper coins each time). Now, because transportation has not been fully restored, the rickshaws have disappeared. Those who go to the school mostly drive cars.</p>
<h3>Talking About Shop Signs</h3>
<p>— Xu Benxi</p>
<p>Shop signs, in a broad sense, are probably like this: because the goal of opening a shop is to make a profit, and the motivation for doing business is to get rich, the meaning of the shop sign cannot escape the scope of these few words: [profit], [wealth], [prosperity], [smoothness]... As for [the truth of business] and [the roundness of customer service], it can only be divided by [male and female] and [noble and lowly], and cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, perhaps due to the public's optimistic thinking and the popularization of spiritual civilization, the forms have changed slightly and are trending towards modernization in the current era. Therefore, if we pay a little attention on the road, we can probably see more novel and interesting shop signs, attracting people to stop and watch, and attracting customers widely.</p>
<p>Recently, a dim sum shop opened in Xiaoximen, named [January 28th]. In my opinion, it contains a profound meaning. Because [January 28th] has fundamentally become a memorial day, and the facts shown by [January 28th] are unforgettable impressions. This shop is a dim sum shop, and the meaning is to say that those who come in to eat dim sum should [light up] the activity of the [heart] on [January 28th] and not forget. However, since there is [January 28th], there should also be [September 18th]. I don't know if it has opened yet?</p>
<p>There is also a small restaurant in Ximen named [Jinjin], famous for buying curry beef soup. The two words [Jinjin] are not only exquisite and small, but also because of [Jinjin], people can't help but go in to taste something [delicious].</p>
<p>[Four Five Six] and [Pure One Color] are close to gambling and inevitably outdated. Those with [Modern] as the shop sign are springing up like mushrooms, and [Peach Blossom Palace], a friend who often goes there said, is quite poetic. I'll just listen to it for now.</p>
<p>The shortest shop sign is a salty goods store on Gongguan Road, simply named [Xing] (prosperity), and I have not found the longest one.</p>
<p>On Daxilu Road, there is a small shop that doesn't know what it sells, naming its shop [Bao Guan Dian] (Guaranteed Closure Shop). It is said that the owner does not hope to prosper, but it has not closed for several years.</p>
<p>There are many more that can be laughed at, and this is just the smallest part.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The Northeast has been lost for a full nine months. I have been doing [national salvation] propaganda work for the sake of [national crisis]. Until now, I have only awakened a part of the intoxicated people, and the Eastern Provinces are still under the control of the Japanese. If this continues, no matter how hard you waste your mind, it will be of no avail. Only the [iron and blood] doctrine is the true meaning of saving the country. Tens of thousands of volunteer troops in the Northeast have been fighting hard for a long time. Although they have not immediately restored our lifeline, the enemy has already felt exhausted. At this time, if the whole country truly implements (1) the government prepares 100,000 elite soldiers to go through the pass at the right time, with external attacks and internal responses; (2) the people continue to donate and concentrate material and spiritual assistance, I dare say that on the September 18th memorial this year, we can drink wine and sing victory songs in Shenyang, Changchun, Longjiang and other places!</p>
<p>The Lushan conference has reportedly already had a recovery plan for the Northeast. What is the content of the plan? It is still the cliché of [diplomacy on the one hand, and resistance on the other]. Alas! Diplomacy is at a loss, resistance is the automatic resistance of the volunteer army, and the government does not fire a single shot or send a single soldier, how can it be said to be resistance? If the League of Nations' September Congress still holds [hope], the result will definitely be a [dream]. In short, [recovering the Northeast], except for [military force], there is no other way!</p>
<h3>World Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>▲The public buses in Huddersfield, England, are second to none among the public buses in any country. The car is fumigated with spices, and the fragrance is fragrant, so that the citizens who are running around in the dust get a moment of comfort after stepping into the car door.</p>
<p>▲Since the prevalence of safety razors, everyone can shave their own beard and go without having to ask a barber to do it. This makes the barbers often have the danger of losing their jobs. The barbers in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia have taken this into consideration and petitioned the country to ban the safety razors and ordinary razors used by private individuals. Anyone with a razor must obtain a license, just like having a gun.</p>
<p>▲Sunbathing has also become popular in the United Kingdom recently. There are already thirty-five seaside amusement parks. Men are allowed to lie on the beach in only their shirts and undershorts for sunbathing. Nine of them were newly established this year.</p>
<p>▲A pottery factory in Staffs, England, plays jazz music on a gramophone during working hours. It is said that it can give the workers spiritual comfort and encourage them to work hard. The output has also increased as a result.</p>
<h3>Talking About Electricity</h3>
<p>— Fengya</p>
<p>The more advanced civilization is, the more developed the electrical business is. It is not necessary to discuss the advanced countries in Europe and America. In the newly emerging Japan, the silk industry has also become increasingly electrified recently. Therefore, the quality of silk is excellent and the output is abundant. Almost all of my country's silk trade overseas has been seized. This is indeed the result of the hard work of their people, but it is also the help of electricity in its development.</p>
<p>My country's electrical business has greatly developed in recent years. Looking at the customs' record of Chinese and foreign trade, in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the total value of imported electrical materials and machinery was 10 million taels of customs silver. It increased year by year thereafter. By the 18th year, the number had reached 16.31 million taels. Checking the report of the German Industrial Inspection Group on the Chinese electrical business, it first stated that the total number of imported goods in China was examined. Germany accounted for 3.9%, of which 11.5% was electrical material. Japan accounted for 33%. The United Kingdom and the United States accounted for only 16 or 17%, etc. The more developed my country's electrical business is, the more it indirectly increases the amount of foreign electrical appliances sold to China. It is truly sigh-worthy. Therefore, manufacturing electrical appliances is really an urgent task today.</p>
<p>Checking the factories of self-made electrical appliances in my country, there are already several. For example, Yizhong specializes in magnetic splints and square sheds, Yongfeng specializes in flashlights, and Fuxu specializes in electric irons. Ya Pu Er, Watson, Klein, etc., either make light bulbs or fans. Due to space limitations, I cannot describe them in detail. Now I will briefly introduce Ya Pu Er Factory, which is the largest in scale and produces the most products. The factory was originally founded by a German named [Ya Pu Er], specializing in the manufacture of light bulbs. Later, it was taken over by the Chinese and expanded, also manufacturing electric fans, electric stoves, and motors. The main factory is located on Liaoyang Road, Hongkou, manufacturing light bulbs and the glass objects necessary for light bulbs. The branch factory is located on Poyang Road, Yangshupu, manufacturing electric fans, electric stoves, and motors. The general manager, Mr. Hu Xiyuan, has a clear mind and is full of perseverance. Therefore, the products are becoming more and more refined and sold to various provinces in the country and the Nanyang Islands. Light bulbs have long filaments, Coca-Cola, argon, frosted, semi-frosted, colored bubbles, etc. They are all bright and durable. Electric fans have 12-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch oscillating table fans, and 36-inch and 56-inch four-blade ceiling fans. Electric stoves have square and round types, all with beautiful styles and durable. Motors range from one-quarter horsepower to two horsepower, with sufficient power and easy to use. Mr. Hu also saw that the number of people in the country who need electrical appliances is increasing day by day. He is deeply concerned that the production cannot meet the demand. He is planning to add the latest type of machine to increase the production of various electrical appliances so that a large amount of demand can be supplied at any time. In the future, Ya Pu Er Factory's contribution to the people of the country will definitely be immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Records of Sights and Sounds of the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhuan</p>
<p>▲ Kang (Heated Brick Bed)</p>
<p>The coal mines in the mountains west of Beijing are abundant. Even if they are mined by indigenous methods, they can still be profitable. The north is bitterly cold, and the season for burning stoves usually lasts from the beginning of the winter month to the end of the second spring month. In recent years, the climate has changed even more. Even in the middle of the ninth lunar month, fire is indispensable. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, it snowed as early as the Double Ninth Festival. If it were not easy to obtain coal, it would be unimaginable. The locals take the coal and grind it into powder. Mix it with yellow soil. Dry it in the sun to make balls, called coal balls. A stove is made of white mud and burned outside. Wait until it is hot. Move it into the room. You can cook soup and porridge on it. Decoctions can be fried. Wealthy families decorate it with copper utensils. In the past, without Western-style stoves, most people used this. However, those who do not know how to use it are prone to coal poisoning, which is worrying. As for the inner court mansions, high halls and large buildings, a mere stove cannot keep them warm. There is a ground kang. The ground kang is a hole in the ground with bricks piled up. It is similar to a cave. Coal is burned in it. The warm air naturally reaches everywhere. This is an ancient system. The Waterways Classic has already mentioned it. The homes of common people do not have this project. They only make a kang in the place where they sleep and get up to keep warm. The northern people mostly build kangs facing south windows. In winter, they can be directly exposed to the sun. Wealthy families also do not set up wooden beds. Only felt is used on the kang. It is also quite comfortable. During the day, the bedding is rolled up and stored away. It is set up at night. This is probably also an ancient style. In ancient times, it was applied to the ground. The Japanese do it now. It is the Han system. The kang is wide and large. Several people can often lie side by side with their feet against the window. There is plenty of room. A low table is set on it during the day. You can read books and write words. Putting books on the kang is not like the narrowness of a desk, which often obstructs your elbows. During the Qing Dynasty, the emperors summoned officials on the kang. The east and west warm pavilions of Qianqing Palace still retain its style. I can imagine the comfort of sitting and getting up with the Chinese cushions and hidden pillows. Today, old houses that have been entered and lived in by southerners have mostly abandoned the kang. I don't know that this thing is suitable for the north and should not be abandoned. Europeans who live in the north like its style. They often want to preserve it. The southerners who first arrive in the north should not try to burn fire in the kang lightly. There are often cases of getting spring fever because of lying on the kang. It is unbearable to them because it is too dry and intense. Poor families in the north cannot do without it. They have no ability to make beds. The room is so small that even if there is a bed, there is no place to put it. The long winter cannot be spent without fire. Living on the kang can save space and save coal. A family of men, women, old and young can lie in a row and sleep soundly until dawn. After the men go out, the women can buy food from those who sell it from the kang. You can spend the whole day without setting foot on the ground. According to the customs of Shanxi, women like to bind their feet to the point where they cannot support their bodies. They stay on the kang all year round. This kind of evil custom is enough to weaken the race. The bannermen women in the northern capital originally did not bind their feet. Even the Han women have mostly liberated themselves recently. Fortunately, it has not come to this point. The word "kang" can be found in the Khitan National History. Its name is already ancient. It is just that the south has never had it.</p>

<p>— The Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Episode Ten: Powerful Figures and the Law, Relying on the Comfort of Women; Shortcuts and Bribery Lead to the Appointing of a General and the Recruiting of Mountain Bandits</p>
<p>Only beside the square table, there was a large wicker reclining chair. There was a black, fat man with a big head and a lot of fat. He opened a row of military uniform buttons on his chest. He tilted his left leg with a yellow leather boot equipped with red gold spurs. He was lying on it very comfortably and peacefully, closing his eyes and resting his mind. Hearing Mao Deshun's shout, he only barely opened a pair of red-threaded eyeballs. He looked at the visitor dimly. He was not willing to stand up immediately and condescend to show his identity as the Chief of the Colonel's Office. On the contrary, An Yutian still had to practice the posture of standing at attention at the door respectfully. He took the opportunity to take a sneak peek at the room again. He also found a person sleeping on the bed with his face up and snoring. He was the most terrifying person. It was the official who insulted him yesterday. This kind of person is still unwilling to show a good face to others even when he is sleeping. Later, Mao Deshun still bent over and walked to the side of the wicker chair. He showed An Yutian's name card and asked Chief Wan to take a look at it. He also pointed to An Yutian himself and introduced him. Counselor An came to pay his respects to the chief. Wan Jinsheng woke up like a dream. The two sensory organs of hearing and vision restored their usual effect. He made an "oh" sound. It was not clear whether it was a yawn or a cheer. Immediately afterwards, he raised his fat body. He stretched out his hand and patted An Yutian on the shoulder. He laughed strangely like an owl, making a "gah gah" sound. Old brother, it's not that I, your elder brother, dare to say anything to you the first time we meet. You are really wrong. Since you are such an affectionate and intimate person with Miss Ba, you should know that back then, when I and the head of the team went to Miss Ba's place, the head of the team set up a banquet inside to entertain guests. I and several brothers and the driver were outside in the accounting room playing small Pai Gow. Whenever we lost too much, we borrowed a hundred and eighty from Miss Ba. There was never a rebuttal. I really still miss her kindness. Yesterday, your little brother came. Why didn't you come to me first to tell the truth? As a result, the people in my office didn't know. They were very negligent. Mao Deshun just came to report to me. Only then did I understand. But things have already been messed up. What if Miss Ba doesn't understand that there is a misunderstanding? She suspects that I am the kind of person who doesn't care about face. I took so much favor from her in the past, but I haven't repaid it at all. Now I treat your little brother as an outsider and refuse to take care of him. Am I still a friend? Who knew that I was very sad to hear this information. It just so happened that you and Miss Ba were so polite. You asked Mao Deshun to send two checks. This is even worse. It seems that I am a villain who doesn't care about friendship and only cares about money. How can I bear it?</p>

<h3>Slight Improvement in the Market Seems</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview Yesterday, the financial market was very calm. The reason for this was that banks had their regular Sunday holiday, and there was no news. In the case of money houses, the exchange rate has been tired for a long time, and there is naturally no major transaction. As a result, everyone watched with their arms folded, and there was no vigor. However, the demolition price of the division was slightly better. Among the auxiliary coins, Guangdong small pieces fell again.</p>
<p>▲ Demolition Price [Foreign Division] The early market was six cents, nine cents, three mils, and half. The afternoon market was six cents, nine cents, three mils, and seven halves. As a result, it was seven halves higher than the previous day. [Silver Division] The early and afternoon markets were both one cent, which was also two points better than the previous day's afternoon market.</p>
<p>▲ Auxiliary Coin Market The Jiangnan small silver gradually fell. The early market was five cents, nine cents, nine mils, and half. The afternoon market was five cents, nine cents, and nine mils. The early market traded 4,000 points, and the afternoon market traded 2,000 points. The Guangdong small silver changed lower by seven mils and a half in the early market. It was five cents, eight cents, and seven mils and half. The afternoon market rebounded by half a mil. It was five cents, eight cents, and eight mils. As a result, it was two halves less. The early market traded 115,000 points, and the afternoon market traded 20,000 points. Copper coins were still 418,000 texts, and more than 36,000 strings were traded.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Imports and Exports [Silver Money] The money house silver public alone received and released 2.01 million. Each road remitted 200,000 to 300,000. There are no records of various bank receipts and releases and silver ocean head payments. [Ocean Money] The early market for remittance tickets was 465,000, and the afternoon market was 105,000. There was no market for banknotes. The money house ocean public alone received and released more than 3.8 million, and small money houses traded more than 300,000.</p>
<h3>Weekly Report on Gold Bar Standard Price Before and After Swap</h3>
<p>Little Change</p>
<p>Continuing Upward Trend</p>
<p>10,000 Bars Still Unswapped</p>
<p>Last week, the trend of gold bar standard prices continued to rise, with a complex situation, but without excessive changes, seeming to be in a consolidating pattern. It initially showed slight weakness, followed by upward movement. The opening price for July was 724 taels. The next day, it was only 21 taels. Furthermore, with the Central Bank vigorously absorbing spot goods and the swap deadline approaching, short sellers were fearful, and long sellers aggressively bid up premiums, pushing prices up. It suddenly broke through the 730 tael mark. On Thursday (the 16th), the swap initially saw long sellers bidding up 8 taels, which later reached 12 taels (but the previous day had been pre-emptively calculated at 6 to 4 taels), resulting in a market price peak of 738 taels and 8 mace. Subsequently, the premium decreased slightly, calculated at slightly over 6 taels. The opening price on the first day of August was approximately 723 taels and a half. The following day, news of a large shipment of Japanese gold being transported to the United States caused air to leak out. It suddenly dropped to 19 taels and 2 mace. By the weekend, exchange rates plummeted, foreign exchange rates shifted, and the British pound strengthened while the US dollar weakened, reaching 35 taels. In summary, the total review for July was 17 taels and 8 mace, while August had a difference of 15 taels and 8 mace. Comparing to the previous week, July (increased by 10 taels and 7 mace), and August increased by 8 taels and 3 mace compared to the initial opening on the 16th. However, there were no special foreign news, except for the Lausanne Conference issue, which is still in dispute. As for the divergent trend in the silver market, the British pound rose while the US dollar fell, so the Shanghai market saw hard shillings and tight US dollars, and the domestic market was the same. This was due to the exchange rate approaching a small spread. It is estimated that the British pound weakened against the US dollar by 5.375 points, while the US dollar plummeted against the British pound by slightly over 6.25 points. Among gold traders, both British pound and US dollar arbitrage were common, with hedging being the majority. The initial settlement price for US dollars was pressed down to around 70 taels, but later rose to 80 taels, and finally settled at a level of 70 taels. Although current spot inventory is depleted, it seems to have increased slightly compared to the beginning of the week. As for the July contracts that have not yet been swapped, there are still over 10,000 bars. It is found that Qian Changxiang, Yi Fengyong, Heng Yu, and Zhi Fengyong are all long sellers, while Run Changyu, Da Decheng, and Tong Taichang are all short sellers. The Dalian group has mostly completed their swaps. The Guangdong group, such as Hengxing, has both long and short positions, but the numbers are not large, as this firm is acting on behalf of other firms.

<h3>Last Week's Bond Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>▲ Trading Volume 21.4 Million</p>
<p>The situation of the various bond markets of the Chinese Business Securities Exchange during the past week (from June 13th to 18th): spot transactions only opened for $149,000. Among them, $48,000 for the 20 Customs, $34,000 for the Salt Tax, $22,000 for Disbandment, and other transactions were very light, with only a few thousand dollars each. However, the 96 Disaster Relief Military Supplies and the 19th Year Customs Public Bonds, which have not had spot transactions for a long time, also opened. Although futures trading seemed to increase slightly compared to the previous week, judging from the market situation, it was quite quiet. The atmosphere of buyers and sellers in the market was still sparse. The daily trading volume during the past week, except for over 4.5 million on Thursday and approximately 4 million on Wednesday, was only around 3 million on the remaining days. However, in the past few weeks, futures trading has consistently been dominated by the current month, with very few transactions in the far months. However, the July futures for bonds within the past week have all opened, and the market has gradually become active. This is because the end of the month is approaching, and the current month's futures are getting closer to the delivery date. The total trading volume for the week was $21,430,000, an increase of over $3,800,000 compared to the previous week, of which the July period accounted for over $5,100,000. The breakdown includes $4,585,000 for Salt Tax, $3,955,000 for Consolidated Tax, $3,725,000 for 20 Customs, $2,220,000 for 20 Rolled, $2,020,000 for 19 Benevolent, $1,640,000 for 19 Customs, $1,385,000 for Disarmament, $1,310,000 for Disbandment, $275,000 for all of the Sixth Customs, and the 96 had only $60,000 in June futures traded. As for the changes, there were no new developments in the domestic situation or diplomatic situation, so the morale in the market was extremely dull. Large investors remained as cautious as before, and small investors were also very scattered. Moreover, the closer the deadline for the first half-year closing, the more difficult it was for the market to improve. Therefore, the trend of the bond market has remained in a stagnant state, with daily changes being uncertain and fluctuations being very slight. The price changes of each bond only fluctuate with the temporary supply and demand situation of the market, and there are no other major reasons to affect the market. Therefore, the overall price trend for the week was more stable than before, and the results were generally slightly weaker, with a difference of only 2 to 3 jiao to 8 to 9 jiao. Only the Disarmament July futures and the 19 Customs small coupon spot, which have not had transactions for a long time, saw a larger price drop. Observing the situation of the bond market, it is still difficult to expect a turnaround in the short term. The highs, lows, and fluctuations of the market prices of various bonds within the past week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Last Week's Yarn Market Plunged</h3>
<p>▲ Human Standard Fell by Four Taels</p>
<p>▲ Spot Yarn Down Two Taels</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market in the past week trended directly downward. This was due to the treacherous global trends, plummeting prices, coupled with domestic economic bankruptcy, rural decline, and the people's livelihood deteriorating daily, leading to stagnant cotton yarn sales and weakening demand. As for Japanese merchants, due to cheap raw materials, they were encroaching on sales in all directions. The North China route had long been hopeless. Local yarn suffered heavy blows and significant damage. Therefore, several domestic yarn factories saw their stockpiles gradually increase. The largest sales outlet for domestic yarn, the South Port, also suffered from unstable political tides and tight finances, resulting in a very weak development force. Only Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Sichuan occasionally had transactions of 10-count coarse yarn, but the volume was not large. Other ports, such as the Yangtze River, were occupied by Japanese merchants, and there were also reports of stockpiles in factories in Hankou. The joint disasters in Fujian and Jiangxi were rampant, and banditry in Hubei and Henan was spreading further. Looking at the situation in all directions, the view was bleak, and how could commerce develop? With these major reasons, the standard yarn market showed a sharp decline, and for a time there was a sense of being out of control. However, some cotton yarn merchants in Shanghai believed that 20-count standard yarn was already at a low level and had a stronger intention to purchase. However, the difference in price compared to the world's price level was still far, and unprecedented low prices had been discovered. Therefore, judging from the overall situation, the future is extremely pessimistic. It was found that customers only purchased a total of 3,618 bales this week, of which 292 bales were traded within the industry, a decrease of 4,000 bales compared to the previous week, and the market price fell by about two taels. The standard yarn in the past week fell step by step. Each month fell by four taels compared to the previous week. The total trading volume for the week was 162,000 bales. The amount purchased by each port is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>| Port | Bales | Port | Bales | Port | Bales |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Sichuan | 820 | Jiangxi | 65 | Zhenjiang | 9 |</p>
<p>| Wuhu | 18 | Qingdao | 10 | Xiamen | 10 |</p>
<p>| Luzhou | 75 | Ningbo | 80 | Inland | 445 |</p>
<p>| Haizhou | 11 | Shantou | 45 | Guangdong | 85 |</p>
<p>| Fuzhou | 5 | Within the Industry | 292 | Changsha | 190 |</p>
<p>| Northern Port | 10 | Yunnan | 770 | Total | 3,668 bales |</p>
<p>The high and low prices of 20-count human standard yarn for one week are listed below:</p>

<h3>Last Week's Cotton Market Had Three Changes</h3>
<p>Initial Fall Followed by Rise, Then Fall Again on the Weekend</p>
<p>In the early part of last week, the cotton market's downtrend continued to rage, and the situation was extremely frightening. The lowest price for standard cotton in July was 27 taels. Before long, U.S. cotton rebounded, because of excessive rainfall and reports of insect damage, rose by 20 points, which bolstered sentiment. More than 10,000 dan worth of chips were covered in the Ningbo Exchange. However, due to the fact that various factories had purchased as much foreign cotton as possible at a low price last year, and their storage was sufficient, there was a danger of being overstocked. There was no appetite for local cotton, and the inventory in the north was very high, with a large amount not exported. As for the Japanese merchants, due to the war, various factories were shut down for two or three months this year, and there was a surplus of raw materials, so there was a surplus, and there were even reports of resale. Also, according to the customs report, 120,000 pieces of American cotton and 20,000 pieces of Indian cotton were imported in May (each piece is 500 pounds). Judging from the overall situation of the world cotton market, the future will still inevitably have a drastic change. It was previously reported that the United States would sell 500,000 bales to our country on credit. According to reliable news, negotiations between the two sides are getting closer and closer. Also, according to a survey by Gao Erting, Shanghai has more than 151,000 pieces of American cotton in stock. In the process of this new and old cotton mixing, this huge amount of American cotton is indeed rare in history. The standard cotton began to fall, someone went long in the middle and rebounded, and the result was a price drop of five or six mace compared to the previous week. The total weekly cotton trading volume was 405,300 dan. American cotton rose by 15 points compared to the previous week. The amount of spot cotton purchased by each factory is listed as follows:</p>
<p>| Manufacturer Purchase | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Transaction Volume | Deadline |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Shanghai Flower | 27.00 | - | 1,500 Bales | Spot Delivery to Factory |</p>
<p>| Fine Velvet Flower | 29.50 | - | 2,000 Pieces | Also Also |</p>
<p>| Yuyao Flower | 26.50 | 25.50 | 3,000 Bales | Also Also |</p>
<p>The high and low prices of Zheng Standard Cotton for one week are listed below:</p>
<p>| Zheng Standard | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Weekend Price | Compared to Previous Week |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| July Futures | 28.90 | 27.00 | 28.40 | Down 5 |</p>

<p>| November Futures | 29.90 | 28.55 | 29.25 | Down 7 |</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Fell More Than It Rose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially weakened due to fewer buyers and good weather, but later rebounded due to some short covering, with futures down 2 to 3 points and spot down 5 points. British cotton futures fell 4 to 6 points, and spot rose 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose 5 points. Indian cotton market closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 18th).</p>

<p>Last Week American Cotton</p>
<h3>Stable Due to Excessive Rainfall</h3>
<p>Cotton crop progress, apart from worrying about insects, is going smoothly.</p>
<p>A New York dispatch on the 17th reported on the cotton market situation for the week, saying that the cotton market's position is actually more stable than before. The climate in the south is colder and more rainy than in previous years, which is conducive to the development of boll weevils. In addition, the overall trade situation is more optimistic, so industry buyers and short sellers covered their positions, and the market price rose slightly this week. Many people closed their positions only because prices rose, but other sales were still limited, as there were reports of boll weevil infestations in the eastern and central cotton belts. According to a report from the American Cotton Production News Agency, the initial spread of boll weevils in the southern half of the cotton belt is increasing in density. The future of the new cotton crop depends on whether the climate can control the insect infestation in the next sixty days. In other respects, the new cotton crop can be considered to be progressing smoothly. Some people still say that if the summer is hot and dry, the insect infestation can be avoided. It is too early to actively buy in anticipation of a possible insect infestation. The attached statistics are as follows (unit: thousand bales):</p>

<h3>Food Grains: Rice Market Situation Stable</h3>
<p>▲ South Shanghai: Yesterday, sources from various districts arrived at about a dozen businesses. There is still plenty of stock in the Puxi area. Due to the moldy and rainy weather, transactions in urban and rural areas are extremely rare. The goods that have been opened must be opened on a sunny day. The prices of thick japonica early and late rice are similar to the previous market.</p>
<p>▲ Xinzha: Yesterday, it rained continuously. The sources from the river included 14 or 15 businesses such as Wuxi, Changzhou, Danyang, Shipu, Jiaoli, and Beizha. There was no market in the morning due to the rain. By the afternoon, the river cargo foot price was about 500 shi. Fresh northern japonica was called tight, while the second color softly fell slightly. The thin rice arrived and sold evenly, and the market was stable.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Silk Market saw a Slight Rise in European Sales</h3>
<p>▲ Although the price was once quoted higher... I fear it will be difficult to sustain for long.</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Merchants Still Suffer Huge Losses... Transactions are Difficult to be Smooth for a While.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign firm silk market, European and American silk sales have plummeted in the recent one or two years, and silk prices have gradually fallen miserably. Shanghai white factory silk has fallen from over 1,000 taels to over 400 taels, and Zhili silk has fallen from over 900 taels to over 450 taels. The Chuanlu Yellow factory silk has fallen from over 800 or 900 taels to over 500 or 600 taels. The gray silk has also fallen from over 600 taels to over 300 taels. Guangdong silk has fallen from over 900 yuan to over 500 yuan (Hong Kong dollars). The accumulated stagnant inventory of silk has reached 50,000 to 60,000 bales. 80% to 90% of silk factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Shandong, Guangdong, and other provinces have closed down. Due to financial panic in the British, American, French, and Japanese raw silk markets, silk product sales are sluggish, artificial silk is encroaching on the market, and raw silk consumption has decreased significantly. Silk prices have repeatedly hit new lows that have never been seen since the silk market began. The Chinese silk industry has fallen into a place of no return. The national economy and people's livelihood are closely related. Now, our government has made overall plans for relief. The price of the British pound has jumped, and the United States and France have revised new tariffs to maintain their budget balance. Japan has 100,000 bales of silk in stock, and the Japanese government has purchased them all in order to protect silk prices. The silk sales in Lyon and other places have gradually turned around, and silk prices have rebounded sharply. However, it is heard that the Japanese government has secretly sold the 100,000 bales of purchased silk to American merchants at the lowest price. In this case, the rebound in overseas silk markets, I fear, will be difficult to sustain for long. Although the Shanghai British and French telegrams indicate that silk prices are high, Chinese silk merchants' silk costs are higher, and the discounts are still huge. It is difficult to expect transactions to be smooth for a while. Overseas Chinese silk prices have increased by 1 or 2 jiao in the US and 5 to 10 francs in France. The weekend prices of Chinese silk in New York and Lyon are listed below (New York price per pound, unit: gold dollar; Lyon price per kilo, unit: franc):</p>
<p>| Silk Type | New York | Lyon | Silk Type | New York | Lyon |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>

<h3>Morocco Prohibits Import of Blue Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>According to a Moroccan telegram, a large batch of Chinese green tea handled by British merchants was found to be blue by the local inspection authorities, who deemed it harmful to health and refused import. After receiving this news, British and French firms in Shanghai actively discussed remedial measures. It is found that, in the past, British firm Tianxiang and French firm Yongxing often used machines to transform the color of the tea they purchased for export (commonly known as Blue Phoenix Eyebrow). Although it has not been confirmed whether the green tea that was blocked this time was manufactured and transported by the above-mentioned firms, it has a significant impact on China's tea trade with France.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Oppose Anhui Province's Increased Tea Tax</h3>
<p>Anhui Province recently implemented a business special tax, which adds a huge tax of 1 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen per dan to exported boxed tea. According to the Tunxi newspaper, the Anhui Finance Department has set up a special bureau for the collection of business special tax in Zhujiacun, 50 miles from Tunxi. When boxed tea passes through its territory, it is forced to pay tax. Tea merchants believe that the business tax has already been paid at the place of origin, so why should there be this disguised likin tax, which is an extra levy of onerous taxes, not only increasing the burden on merchants, but also violating the central government's orders. Therefore, tea merchants unanimously and firmly oppose it.</p>
<h3>Tea News from the Sunset Industry Area</h3>
<p>▲婺yuan Seed Tea Already Showing Buds: Wuyuan's seed tea is showing buds unusually densely this year due to the tea trees, which were damaged by spring erosion and had not fully matured, sprouting. Furthermore, the weather has been suitable for the past two weeks, with morning dew falling every day, resulting in excellent quality. However, since the Shanghai market has remained sluggish, merchants are struggling to sell their spring tea. They find it difficult to force the sale of seed tea as well. Farmers in the mountains are determined to accept losses in the current market, letting the tea wither rather than waste their efforts. According to recent surveys, over 2,000 dan of spring tea have not been sold in the entire county, with the most in Tuochuan Yuan in the north. Farmers in that area are facing severe economic hardship, unable to exchange their goods for money, and their plight is indescribable. Given the state of spring tea, the situation for seed tea is self-evident.</p>
<p>▲Tunxi Tea Market Remains Depressed: The Tunxi tea market has been lifeless for the past month, following the downturn in the Shanghai market. Tea firms are holding stockpiles of 4,000 to 5,000 dan of tea, with few inquiries from buyers. Merchants are eagerly awaiting news from Shanghai, hoping for a turnaround to sell their goods quickly. However, instead of good news, alarming reports keep coming in, causing distress and leading many to lament the unreliability of the tea industry. The market's depression is evident. However, the price of tea powder sold to domestic shops is still rising, increasing from 18 yuan to 24 or 25 yuan per dan. Tea shops are shifting their focus from overseas to domestic sales, sending representatives to Wuyuan and other places to secure more goods to meet demand. This is a small transaction that can offer some relief amid the extremely cold overseas tea market.</p>
<p>▲Qimen Seed Tea Completely Suspended: The production of Qimen seed tea has always been abundant, making it the second-largest source of income for the county. In the past, the price of seed tea was often as high as 50 or 60 yuan. Currently, although the buds of seed tea in various townships of Qimen are ready for picking, merchants are refraining from increasing production due to the Shanghai industry's decision to prohibit the purchase of seed tea and the lack of funds. This is hindering sales. As a result, Qimen seed tea production has been completely suspended this year, greatly affecting the economic situation of tea farmers in the county. Some farmers are still harvesting and processing tea for pre-sale to domestic shops at low prices, but there is virtually no market.</p>

<h3>First Batch of New Yan'er Mushrooms Arrives</h3>
<p>The new mushroom season has arrived. It was heard yesterday that the first batch of new Yan'er mushrooms has arrived in Shanghai. The Fujian guild had attempted to buy them at a price of 72 taels. However, the price in Hankou is only 64 taels, and adding all the extra expenses makes it difficult to make a profit. It is expected that the market price will likely drop in the future.</p>

<h3>Plum Rains Affect Metal Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's continuous plum rains greatly reduced market transactions. Exports were particularly quiet due to the weekend. The market was quite sluggish, and there were no price changes for any items. Tinplate remained at around 10 taels, and black iron sheet was still priced at 9 taels. The outside market was asking 13 taels and 2.5 qian for lead, while the domestic market was slightly lower. The prices of bamboo steel, angle iron, and English steel plates remained the same. Few transactions were reported for French Western nails, galvanized iron sheets, corrugated iron, and new plate yuan, aside from inquiries.</p>

<p>Opinion</p>
<h3>That Which Cannot Be Spoken, Must Not Be Spoken</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>According to recent news, Japan is still actively seeking to convene a round table conference in Shanghai. In the Northeast, not only is there no hope of recovering lost territory, but it is also reported that the Japanese have even more cruel and far-reaching plans that are about to be implemented. Assuming that our government and people remain unaware, the tragic curtain of national subjugation will soon be unveiled.</p>
<p>Looking at our country, the scourge of bandits and communists is almost everywhere. In Guangdong, the two Chen factions are again engaged in infighting, staging a [full-scale martial arts] performance. According to a report released by the China International Trade Association, Japanese goods increased by more than double from January to April. Furthermore, from January to April this year, the total import surplus reached 177 million customs taels.</p>
<p>The September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident were witnessed and heard by all Chinese people. If these events still cannot awaken the national consciousness, it is truly a case of [not weeping until one sees the coffin]. Only by personally experiencing the pain of national subjugation will the Chinese people wake up from their delusion. Alas, what more can be said? Only one more word of warning:</p>
<p>If repentance comes only when the disaster is at hand, it may be too late.</p>

<h3>South of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>Spring has departed from the South of the Yangtze River, the willows are green,</p>
<p>Drinking wine and grasping branches, only tears fall.</p>
<p>Everyone says the mountains and rivers are not as they were,</p>
<p>Yet the scenery of the Xinting Pavilion is sadly new.</p>
<p>Thousand-fathom abandoned fortresses with traces of burning,</p>
<p>Ten miles of remnant flowers with the fragrance after battle.</p>
<p>Boundless feelings of home and country like Du Fu,</p>
<p>Unable to bear riding a horse out of the training grounds.</p>
<h3>Inspired by the Hongkou Park</h3>
<p>Three decades of war at sea,</p>
<p>The country was betrayed, and a treaty was signed under the city walls.</p>
<p>Abandoned fortresses are divided and the corpses of dogs and thieves remain,</p>
<p>The new capital has moved and the cockcrow is lost.</p>
<p>Even if Zhuge Liang comes from the south,</p>
<p>Who will be Jing Ke in the palace from the west?</p>
<p>Alas, the nine provinces have all made the same mistake,</p>
<p>When will the long whale be slain east of the sea?</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Simple Bottling Method</h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>The Shen Bao of the 18th published an article on [Homemade Canning Method], which is indeed a method of utilizing waste and benefiting storage. However, it mentions using tinplate to make a lid, which is a difficult problem. The tinplate used for canning is a special type with a high tin coating, not easily found in ordinary stores. (It is American-made and only available in foreign firms, costing over 20 yuan per box.) If you use empty biscuit boxes or ordinary tinplate, the contents will definitely react with it, causing blackening, rusting, and various forms of spoilage. I now have a simple bottling method that does not require tinplate or soldering, and is very safe and convenient. I will write it down below for readers to easily understand.</p>
<p>1.  Bottling Equipment</p>
<p>A. An ordinary heat-resistant glass cup.</p>
<p>B. A round piece of glass slightly larger than the mouth of the glass cup. You can draw the desired size and buy it at a hardware store, or you can use broken glass from a window. First, draw the desired size on it with ink, then place it in a large bucket filled with cold water. Hold the glass in one hand and gently cut along the drawn lines with old scissors.</p>
<p>C. A flat rubber band about the same size as the mouth of the glass cup, about two-thirds of an inch wide. You can make it yourself from broken basketball bladders, soccer bladders, or car inner tubes. The outer edge of the rubber band should have a protrusion the size of a broad bean.</p>
<p>2.  Bottling Method</p>
<p>After preparing the food to be stored, place it in the glass cup (do not fill it too full, leaving at least half an inch from the mouth). Then place the rubber band on the mouth of the cup and press it firmly with the glass. It is best to use something heavy to hold it down, but make sure the gas inside can escape. Then place it in a pot or steam it in a rice cooker. After boiling for 20 minutes (the time varies depending on the type of contents), take it out and press the glass firmly. At this time, prevent outside air from entering the cup as quickly and tightly as possible. Let it cool gradually. After it is completely cooled, the glass will naturally stick to the glass cup. At this point, the entire process is complete. When eating, simply pull the protruding part of the rubber band, and the glass will open naturally. The glass and glass cup can be reused for the second manufacturing.</p>
<p>This bottling method can also be used for large-scale manufacturing. Glass cups and glass can be ordered from glass factories, and rubber bands can be ordered from rubber companies. (There are special machines for heating, but I won't go into details due to space limitations. If you want to inquire about details, you can write to Jiao Yimin of the Kang Nao Tuo Road Provincial Fisheries School.) This bottling method is most suitable for storing fruits and vegetables, because the bright red fruits and green vegetables can be seen through the glass, attracting the attention of buyers. As for the storage period, according to actual experience, fruits and vegetables can be stored for about two years. If storing other foods that require high heat, because the glass cannot withstand high heat, it cannot be stored for so long. Also, although the rubber band does not have the opportunity to contact the contents, it does not matter.</p>
<p>Family Problems</p>
<h3>Words of Old Mrs. Zheng</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng has three sons, the youngest of whom is twenty-five or six years old, so they are all married and have children. She lives with her three sons, three daughters-in-law, and many grandchildren in one house. Everyone says she is very fortunate.</p>
<p>Recently, this large family has been divided into three small families. Someone asked Old Mrs. Zheng, "Your family was reunited and so happy. Why did you break it up for no reason?" Before Mrs. Zheng could answer, she let out a long sigh. After a long pause, she spoke eloquently, "People say that my three sons all work in society, earn money to support me, and have three daughters-in-law to serve me, and many grandchildren around my knees to make me laugh, and envy me this good fortune. In fact, I haven't enjoyed the fortune, but I have suffered the anger. When my eldest daughter-in-law married into the family, she and her husband treated me with great obedience, and the brothers and sisters-in-law were also very close. At this time, I was indeed very happy. Next year, the second daughter-in-law entered the door. I thought that with one more daughter-in-law, I would enjoy even more happiness. Who knew that the second daughter-in-law had a fierce appearance and spoke very sharply. The eldest daughter-in-law was also a capable person. She relied on the idea of being the first to enter the door as the elder, so the sisters-in-law began to crack. The second daughter-in-law's fierce words and sharp tongues were heard by the eldest daughter-in-law, who then pointed at the mulberry tree and scolded the locust tree. The second daughter-in-law would not give in and retorted. Dear family members became enemies. Both sides complained to their husbands on the pillow. The two sons listened to the words on the pillow and each helped his own wife. One resented his sister-in-law, and the other hated his sister-in-law. Eventually, the brothers also became enemies. My good family was filled with discord. After two years like this, the third daughter-in-law entered the door. Who knew she was also a person who was not afraid of being tough and refused to suffer any losses. The third son naturally learned from his two elder brothers and helped his wife. From then on, the three couples became the Three Kingdoms of Wei, Shu, and Wu. I contacted you, and you alienated him. The dispute never ended. You came to tell me, and he came to tell me. Although I made judgments with an attitude of impartiality, they still said that I was biased, helping this one and helping that one. Later, I stopped caring about them and let them fight and argue.</p>
<p>The family's expenses were originally paid equally by the three sons. Since the three brothers became enemies, you were unwilling to pay, and he was unwilling to pay immediately. You said he earned more and should pay more, and he said you had children and should pay more. Today, the eldest daughter-in-law was cooking and buying vegetables, and the second and third daughters-in-law said that her vegetables were not good and that she had skimmed the oil. Tomorrow, the second daughter-in-law was cooking and buying vegetables, and the eldest and third daughters-in-law said the same. The day after tomorrow, the third daughter-in-law was cooking and buying vegetables, and the eldest and second daughters-in-law said the same. To be honest, they really all wanted to skim the oil and made the public dishes simple and unappetizing, while buying smoked fish and braised meat to eat in their rooms with the skimmed oil money. The only one who suffered was me.</p>
<p>All three houses have children. What do children know? They are good one moment, scolding the next, and fighting the next. It is true that they are good for a moment and then fight again after a moment. But the three daughters-in-law made a big deal out of every small thing. Because of the children's affairs, they would scold each other almost every day. Once, the eldest house's six-year-old son and the second house's three-year-old daughter were playing in the living room. The second house's daughter wanted to sit on a short stool, and in an instant, she fell over. Coincidentally, she hit her head on the corner of another stool. Immediately, she cried so hard that she couldn't breathe. The second daughter-in-law knew about it in the room and rushed out to pick up her beloved daughter, kicking the eldest house's son and saying that he was wicked and pushed her daughter. The eldest house's son cried upstairs and told his mother. His mother scolded loudly from upstairs. The people downstairs scolded upwards. The more they scolded, the fiercer they became. One said, "Dare you come down?" and the other said, "Dare you come upstairs? You're not afraid, and I'm not afraid!" Finally, they met on the stairs and fought until the feathers flew. The third daughter-in-law stood by and sneered. The grandchildren cried when they saw their mothers fighting. I was so angry that I sat in the room and ignored them, letting them fight each other.</p>
<p>Speaking to this point, Old Mrs. Zheng sighed deeply again and said, "In short, the misfortunes in our family are too many to tell. Look at me in this family, is it a blessing or anger? I can't take this anger anymore. If I continue to take it, it will kill me. So I divided their families and let them go their own way. I live alone, hiring a little maid to do laundry, soak in water, and cook. I really feel relaxed and free. Now I am truly enjoying my fortune."</p>

<h3>Chaperon's Words</h3>
<p>— Qi Huai</p>
<p>A chaperon was originally a type of hat worn by middle-aged women or old maids as a symbol. In the 19th century, the word came to represent women who accompanied young women to public places. Generally speaking, social interactions between men and women were not yet formally open at the time. When young women were talking to men, their parents were somewhat worried and always asked a chaperon to accompany them. It is said that this custom is still practiced in old-fashioned families in England. If you go to visit your girlfriend or invite her out on a trip, there will always be a middle-aged woman by your side.</p>
<p>Now, some universities in China with co-education have also adopted this system. I will not discuss whether this system is good or bad. I will only talk about a story I know about the implementation of this system in a university and the related events that occurred.</p>
<p>A certain university implemented co-education in the autumn. However, because the university was located inland, social interactions between men and women were not very open. Therefore, the university authorities, out of caution, made a special statement in the advertisement for recruiting female students, stating that the female dorm supervisor would be responsible for all matters concerning female students. After the start of the semester, they further announced the adoption of the chaperon system. That is, social interactions between male and female students were only allowed on Saturday afternoons, from 4:00 to 6:00. If there were special circumstances that required them to go to the female dormitory, they had to obtain permission from the dorm supervisor. Furthermore, female students who participated in any public recreational gatherings, such as tea parties or trips, had to invite a chaperon to go with them.</p>
<p>This system was implemented and there were no objections from any parties. The female students were even more silent. The meddlesome male students adopted a "why bother stirring up the water in the pool of spring" attitude, only discussing it in their free time as material for conversation.</p>
<p>Later, a class took a trip to a nearby mountain. The female students were members of the class and naturally had to participate. But what about the chaperon? Learning from the last time, when a class went on a picnic without inviting a chaperon, the female students were lectured by the female dorm supervisor and even deprived of the right to go out for the month. So this time, they could not "knowingly violate the rules." Therefore, the class invited the female dorm supervisor to serve as the chaperon. This female dorm supervisor was very old, with white hair and a somewhat clumsy gait. Generally speaking, she was not very happy to accept this mountain climbing trip. But unexpectedly, she was still young and vigorous and agreed without hesitation. When the date arrived, the male and female students all happily arrived at the green mountains in the suburbs. That Coaperon was truly "fulfilling her duties" and following the female students "step by step." This made the male students who were waiting for an opportunity to socialize with the female students suffer, losing this good opportunity. On the other hand, it also made the female dorm supervisor's legs suffer, as she walked an unknown number of miles.</p>
<p>Things were passing like this. All sorts of restrictions ultimately could not stop the social nature of young men and women. The female dormitory was off-limits, but under the chaperon system, there was no rule that female students were not allowed to go to the library at night. Therefore, when the lights were first lit, the library with its dazzling array of books was always packed with people. In that library, an unknown number of romances were taking place.</p>
<p>Startling Sights</p>
<h3>Lingering Pain After the War</h3>
<p>— Hong Shui</p>
<p>"Ah! Sister Lian, I haven't seen you in so long! Where did you move to?" As soon as I saw my cousin, I began to ask anxiously and fearfully.</p>
<p>"Yu Yuan Road × Number! Thank God, I didn't expect we would meet again!" She said softly and tremblingly from deep within her throat.</p>
<p>"Every time I heard the whirring of the engines and the rumbling of the cannons, my heart would beat violently with it, especially when I thought of you all! How did you escape, anyway?"</p>
<p>"I originally thought that our government, with a spirit of loving peace, would compromise to satisfy the desires of the violent Japanese, so that the peaceful Shanghai would not be disturbed. Who knew the god of war..." At this point, her tone became particularly loud and her attitude was very tragic and sad. "...Even if we wanted to take refuge, we couldn't because of the environment. The whole family, old and young, could only face each other and gamble with the god of war day and night!"</p>
<p>"Are Grandma and Xiongdi both well?"</p>
<p>"Grandma? Died... Xiongdi is sick... in the hospital! And he keeps making a fuss about seeing your cousin..."</p>
<p>"What, what?" I interrupted her impatiently.</p>
<p>"At that time, the area near our house became the center of the war. The Japanese marines were firing machine guns all day and night, so our house naturally became a target. The east side collapsed in response to the sound of cannons, and the west side collapsed in response to the sound of gunfire. Grandma panicked for a moment, couldn't catch her breath, and just slid down from the chair, her white eyes turned upwards, and she died! Then Xiongdi was also frightened and became mentally ill, which is what the doctor confirmed!"</p>
<p>"How sad! So what happened to Grandma's body?"</p>
<p>"Ah! It's a sin to say it! Just as the gunfire was relatively sparse, Mrs. Lin next door said, 'It's hard enough to save our own lives!' She forced me to drag Xiongdi out. I only felt dizzy. When the ceasefire went to see, there was only a pile of rubble and a few green grass growing. Where was the house? Where was Grandma's body?" Her tears fell like rain!</p>
<p>"After surviving the disaster, my body can't stand any more grief, and Xiongdi will also be affected by you indirectly..."</p>
<p>"Today's Zhabei, ravaged by enemy bullets, has become a scorched earth. The broken tiles, charred wood, collapsed walls, and bullet holes as dense as beehives are all startling to see..." Silver tears flowed from her eyes again, dripping down and lining her pale and thin cheeks, making her sadness and suffering even more evident. At the same time, I also thought of the countless suffering compatriots in the war zone, and couldn't help but shed a few tears of sympathy, even though I was still muttering in my mouth not to cry!</p>
<p>"The government, which resisted for a long time, compromised with imperialism in order to maintain its power. When the Japanese army abandoned and returned full of loot, did the government ever consider the countless losses of our people?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Sister Lian, how can we talk about such idle talk? It's better to endure the pain and sigh!"</p>
<p>The setting sun slowly disappeared below the horizon, and a crescent moon hung in the pale clouds. At this time, we said goodbye sadly.</p>
<p>Written in the middle of the night on June 17, 1932.</p>
