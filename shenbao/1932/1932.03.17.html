<p>時評</p>
<h3>「滿家」是日本的生命綫嗎（一）彬</h3>
<p>丨謹貢獻於國聯調查團丨</p>
<p>日本自從去年九一八以武襲取我東後。即時世界發放反宣傳說。「滿蒙爲日本的生命綫。」「大和民族的要求爲最少限度的生存權。」「我大和民族如由滿家退却。即大和民族生存權被否認的時候。」（見松岡洋右近著東亞全局之動搖）軍閥政客這樣的呌着。所謂學者們也是這樣的附和着。此一宣傳很是以激起其國民的感情。復足以朦蔽國際人士的耳目。以掩飾其侵略的野心。所以我們有予以嚴正批駁的必要</p>
<p>「滿蒙」是日本的生命綫嗎。還是「滿蒙」自有其偉大的生命。我們要指出此一問題的正確。性第一先從「日本移民地之滿蒙」一點上去體認分析。</p>
<p>現在政友會内閣總理犬養毅氏說。「人口過乘的日本國民。或作爲平和的商人或作爲平和的工業者。或作爲勤勞的農民。不得不向四隣謀融合而移殖。此一事在我民族無寗視其爲最小限度的生存要求爲得當。」所以人口問題在日本人看來。當然爲將來生活的一大問題於是日本軍閥政客們狂呼着「日本人口問題應於「滿蒙」求解决」這種宣傳是何等的動聽。何等的含有誘惑性呵。大多數日本的國民。都被此一宣傳所麻醉了</p>
<p>現在我們得到一正確的答復了。可是並非歐美學者研究的結果。又不是中國人的偏見。乃是出之於日本人之口。還是日本言論界最有權威的學者室伏高信氏研究所得的正確理解。室伏高信氏在去年九一八以後。寫了一本滿蒙論。關於「日本人口問題應於「滿蒙」求解决」一點。駁得最有價値。他說「日本的所謂滿蒙積極政策。果以解决人口問題爲出發點嗎。這點當另作别論。現在先就滿蒙一地是否能解决日本人口問題一點。加以研究。我們先檢查過去的成績。從小村外相即提倡滿蒙移民政策此爲一般人所深知日本經營滿蒙對於此點的注力。當更明白換一句話說日本經營滿蒙的主眼。在增加滿蒙居留的日本人没有妨碍如東洋拓殖會社的設立。田中内閣時滿蒙大移民的設計都本着這意義其結果怎樣呢一九○六年日俄和約以來。曾得到什麽成績。大連爲日本人口增加最多的都市。大正元年日本人三萬四千零四十五人。中國人七萬九千九百七十七人。昭和四年日本人增到九萬零三人。中國人增到二十五萬零九十一人。所謂日本經營在滿洲的唯一都市大連。十八年間只增加了五萬。而中國人則增加了十七萬。可知人口增加。完全爲自然的增加一點。是値得注意的。大連以外的日本人如何分布呢。關東洲（大連除外）一萬五千餘人。滿鐵附屬地九萬三千餘人領事館區域四千餘人。僑居滿洲内地七千餘人。總計二十萬二千五百四十七人。（滿蒙年鑑昭和四年統計）再就在滿日本人口加以解剖我們又可獲得别笪重大的敎訓。官吏和其家族三萬三千餘人。滿鐵社員和其家族三萬四千餘人。滿鐵僱員和其家族四萬六千餘人。共計十一萬四千八百四十七人。（昭和三年大連經濟年史）據此。在滿日本人半數以上爲官吏與滿鐵公司有關係的。雖日本大聲疾呼。以國家力量提倡移民滿蒙。但其結果。日本人移住滿蒙和其自然的增加在二十五年間還不過未滿九萬人。日本人口每年增加八九十萬人從日俄和約以來。已有一千八百萬的增殖。這九萬的移民成績。於日本人口問題能有多大的解决功用呢。」</p>
<p>室伏高信氏把數目字來再估價「日本人口問題應於滿蒙求解决」的不正確。足以給日本軍閥政客們反宣傳以當頭捧喝。可是現在不僅如犬養毅氏所說日本人「向四隣謀融合而移殖。」竟想進而據爲已有稱霸東亞了。這是値得世界人士加以注意的。</p>

<h3>Is "Manchuria" Japan's Lifeline? (1) Bin</h3>
<p>| Dedicated to the League of Nations Investigation Commission |</p>
<p>Since Japan seized our Northeast by force last year on September 18th, the world has been flooded with propaganda saying, "Manchuria and Mongolia are Japan's lifeline." "The demands of the Yamato race are the minimum for survival." "If our Yamato race retreats from Manchuria, it will be tantamount to denying the survival rights of the Yamato race." (See Yosuke Matsuoka's recent book, "The Shaking of the Overall Situation in East Asia") Military leaders and politicians are shouting this. So-called scholars are also echoing it. This propaganda greatly stirs up the emotions of its people and obscures the eyes and ears of international figures to cover up its aggressive ambitions. Therefore, we must sternly refute it.</p>
<p>Are "Manchuria and Mongolia" Japan's lifeline? Or do "Manchuria and Mongolia" have their own great life? We must point out the correctness of this issue. First, we must recognize and analyze it from the perspective of "Manchuria and Mongolia as Japanese immigrant areas."</p>
<p>Currently, Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai of the Seiyukai Cabinet says, "The overpopulated Japanese people, whether as peaceful merchants, peaceful industrialists, or hardworking farmers, must seek integration with their neighbors and emigrate. Our people must not regard this as the minimum requirement for survival." So, in the eyes of the Japanese, the population problem is naturally a major issue for future life. Then, Japanese military leaders and politicians clamor, "The Japanese population problem should be solved in 'Manchuria and Mongolia'." How appealing is this propaganda! How tempting! Most Japanese people are anesthetized by this propaganda.</p>
<p>Now we have a correct answer. But it is not the result of research by European and American scholars, nor is it the prejudice of the Chinese. It comes from the mouth of a Japanese. It is the correct understanding obtained by Mr. Takashiro Murobuse, the most authoritative scholar in the Japanese journalistic circles. After September 18th last year, Mr. Takashiro Murobuse wrote a book on Manchuria and Mongolia. His rebuttal of the point that "the Japanese population problem should be solved in 'Manchuria and Mongolia'" is the most valuable. He said, "Is Japan's so-called positive policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia really based on solving the population problem? This point should be discussed separately. Now, let's first study whether Manchuria and Mongolia can solve the Japanese population problem. Let's first examine the past achievements. Since Foreign Minister Komura first advocated the policy of immigration to Manchuria and Mongolia, this is well known to the general public. Japan's focus on this point in managing Manchuria and Mongolia is even clearer. In other words, the main focus of Japan's management of Manchuria and Mongolia is to increase the number of Japanese residing in Manchuria and Mongolia without hindrance, such as the establishment of the Oriental Development Company. The grand design for large-scale immigration to Manchuria and Mongolia during the Tanaka Cabinet was based on this meaning. What was the result? What achievements have been made since the Russo-Japanese Peace Treaty of 1906? Dalian is the city with the largest increase in the Japanese population. In the first year of the Taisho era, there were 34,045 Japanese and 79,977 Chinese. In the fourth year of the Showa era, the number of Japanese increased to 90,003 and the number of Chinese increased to 250,091. The so-called only city in Manchuria managed by Japan, Dalian, has only increased by 50,000 Japanese in eighteen years, while the number of Chinese has increased by 170,000. It can be seen that the increase in population is entirely a natural increase, which is worth noting. How are the Japanese distributed outside of Dalian? In Kanto Prefecture (excluding Dalian), there are more than 15,000 people. In the Manchurian Railway Affiliated Area, there are more than 93,000 people. In the consulate area, there are more than 4,000 people. More than 7,000 Japanese live in the interior of Manchuria. The total is 202,547 people. (Statistics from the Manchuria and Mongolia Yearbook, Showa 4th year) Furthermore, by dissecting the Japanese population in Manchuria, we can obtain other major lessons. There are more than 33,000 officials and their families. There are more than 34,000 Manchurian Railway employees and their families. There are more than 46,000 Manchurian Railway employees and their families. The total is 114,847 people. (Dalian Economic Yearbook, Showa 3rd year) Based on this, more than half of the Japanese in Manchuria are officials and related to the Manchurian Railway Company. Although Japan loudly calls for and promotes immigration to Manchuria and Mongolia with national power, the result is that the Japanese who have immigrated to Manchuria and Mongolia and their natural increase have not exceeded 90,000 people in twenty-five years. The Japanese population increases by 800,000 to 900,000 people every year. Since the Russo-Japanese Peace Treaty, there has been an increase of 18 million people. How much can this immigration achievement of 90,000 people solve the Japanese population problem?"</p>
<p>Mr. Takashiro Murobuse's re-evaluation of the incorrectness of "the Japanese population problem should be solved in Manchuria and Mongolia" is enough to give the Japanese military leaders and politicians a head-on blow to their counter-propaganda. However, now, not only as Mr. Tsuyoshi Inukai said, the Japanese "seek integration with their neighbors and emigrate," but they even want to seize it as their own and dominate East Asia. This is worth the attention of people around the world.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team to Participate in Peace Talks</h3>
<p>Stay in Shanghai May Need to Be Extended by a Few Days</p>
<p>Joint Association of Universities Held a Grand Banquet Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Lord Lytton Delivered a Solemn Reply</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day after the League of Nations Investigation Team arrived in Shanghai and received a formal invitation from our country. At noon, representatives from various universities held a banquet at the Hua An Building. At 5 p.m., Mrs. Kong Xiangxi, Soong Ai-ling, and Mrs. Soong Tzu-wen, Chang Yueh-yi, welcomed them at a tea party at the Kong residence. At 8 p.m., the three ministers from England, America, and France, and the Italian chargé d'affaires, held a banquet at the Cathay Hotel. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Visiting Various National Authorities</h3>
<p>At 8 a.m. yesterday, the committee members of the League of Nations Investigation Team from England, America, France, Italy, and Germany visited the ministers, chargés d'affaires, and naval commanders of the five countries in Shanghai, and consulted on the facts of the Shanghai Incident. After returning to their residences at 10 a.m., they met with consuls from various countries and relevant parties to collect investigative materials. They were extremely busy.</p>
<h3>University Associations Luncheon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Association held a luncheon at the Hua An Hotel yesterday noon to welcome the League of Nations Investigation Team. The following were present: Lord Lytton, Chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Team; Mr. McCoy from the United States; Mr. Claude from France; Mr. Scotti from Italy; Mr. Schnee from Germany; Secretary-General Haas; Mr. Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University; Mr. Liu Zhanen, President of Soochow University; Mr. Li Denghui, President of Fudan University; Mr. Hu Shuhua, President of Tongji University; Mr. He Shizhen, President of Chi Chee University; Mr. Cao Huiqun, President of Datong University; Mr. Ou Yuanhuai, President of Daxia University; Mr. Wang Jingqi, President of Labor University; Mr. Yan Fuqing, President of Central Medical College; and Mr. Wu Jingxiong, Dean of Soochow Law School. Mr. Li Zhaohuan delivered a welcome speech, and Lord Lytton delivered a reply.</p>
<h3>Li Zhaohuan's Welcome Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Li Zhaohuan delivered a welcome speech, saying, "We, the representatives of the twenty universities in Shanghai, are deeply honored to be able to banquet our distinguished guests here. China, as a member of the League of Nations, is in an era of peace with other member states today. Unfortunately, it alone has suffered the tragedy of modern warfare. In recent years, we have repeatedly suffered natural and man-made disasters, and we have been working hard to prevent and rescue disasters. Unexpectedly, our neighbors have ulterior motives and have taken advantage of our difficulties to attack us. We are determined to survive, and the survival and economic integrity of our country are now in grave danger. If someone begs us for mercy, we are willing to provide relief, but sovereignty is what we cannot sacrifice. Under threats, aggression, and attacks, we can only resist. We trust the League of Nations because we believe that the poison of those who force me to invade me and the weakness of our defensive forces are not the only reasons. The acts of aggression and conspiracy are actually related to the serious problems of the world. Our appeals have so far had little effect, which makes us feel guilty. However, because we believe that justice is in the hearts of the people, our spirits are still cheerful. During this unprecedented trial, we still adhere to the rational stance on which our ancestors created culture, and we cannot abandon the truth on which the world's peaceful order depends. We firmly believe that you are here for humanity and truth, so even though our lives have suffered all kinds of wounds, we still feel that there is a glimmer of light ahead. Now, I would like to express our sincere welcome and offer a toast to the happiness, health, and success of your work during your stay in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Wang Jingqi's Speech</h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Jingqi, President of Labor University, said in his speech, "For months, peace-loving people all over the world have heard dangerous calls and have repeatedly tried to stop bloodshed. What is clear to us is that invading troops oppress from north to south, and numerous planes attack cities, causing innocent women and children to perish and cultural institutions to be destroyed. If you gentlemen experience the situation, you will understand the misery. However, there are still many friends of the League of Nations in the academic community who grieve and look west, firmly believing in the League of Nations. Since the European War, mankind has suffered greatly, and political, economic, and ideological trends have become increasingly different, and they are struggling every day. We, the academics, representing China today, and representing the youth of China tomorrow, bear a heavy responsibility and strive to guide them towards a just and peaceful path. However, we feel that the greatest difficulty lies in how we will tell our youth. Will we make them believe that military power is omnipotent and should be worshiped? Or should we tell our youth that there is justice in the world and that the world will rise up against acts that violate human morality? And that there is a League of Nations that considers the actions of warmongers to be contrary to good faith? The results of your visit to China and the subsequent fair investigation will surely make the important mission of the academic community easier. The time has come for the idea of international morality to be realized as a true and clear fact."</p>
<h3>Lord Lytton's Reply</h3>
<p>Lord Lytton, Chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Team, replied, "I am here on behalf of the entire delegation to thank you for your warm welcome. May I, as a representative of the university, say a word to you, the university? Recently, two of your universities have suffered great disasters along with innocent people. You speak generously now, but you still say that there is a glimmer of light ahead. Our country has a proverb that when things are at their worst, they turn for the better. Perhaps today is the time when things turn for the better. What I want to say to you today is that this light, as you call it, comes from Geneva. Therefore, I would like to tell you in what ways the League of Nations can help you and what conditions the League of Nations requires. I believe that the mission of the League of Nations is to protect member states from aggression and to uphold justice to dispel the psychological fears of member states. However, the League of Nations expects member states to maintain peace and sincerity. It is impossible for any country that hates another country and deliberately provokes it to hope that the League of Nations will come out to save it. The League of Nations expects all member states to feel that no country has the right to harm another country. At the same time, the League of Nations requires its member states to avoid all actions that harm other countries. The League of Nations will definitely help any country that has the right to make a request without sacrificing other countries. The League of Nations will also prevent those who make unreasonable demands and seek to seize them by force. The above-mentioned points may seem like empty talk, but the task of the League of Nations is to proceed based on this principle. You are all learned people, and I hope you will announce this meaning to the people. Today's teachers are tomorrow's warriors. I would like to offer a toast to your health."</p>
<h3>Tea Party of the Two Ladies</h3>
<p>At 5 p.m. yesterday, Mrs. Song Ai-ling, the wife of Kong Xiangxi, a member of the Central Committee, and Mrs. Chang Yueh-yi, the wife of Finance Minister Song Tzu-wen, hosted a tea party for the League of Nations Investigation Team at the Kong Residence on West Aihams Road. More than 200 Chinese and foreign guests attended, including Danish Minister Hochmann, Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano, Czech Minister Feitzer, naval attachés from various countries, and consuls from various countries. On our side, Gu Weijun, Guo Taiqi, Wu Tiecheng, Guo Chengen, Yu Qiaqing, Wu Jingxiong, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Boqi, Zhang Zhuping, Xu Shiying, Bei Songsun, Xu Xinliu, and others attended. On the women's side, there were Dr. Zheng Yuxiu, Mrs. Wang Zhengting, and dozens of socialites. At 5:30, the five committee members of the investigation team arrived one after another and were personally received by the Kong and Song ladies and Kong Xiangxi and Song Tzu-wen. The tea party was prepared with Cantonese dim sum, and Professor Zhu Ying of the National Conservatory of Music and the Yaotiao Orchestra performed silk and bamboo music to add to the atmosphere, playing three pieces in total: 1) Ensemble "Autumn Moon in the Han Palace" 2) Ensemble "Moonlit Night on the Xunyang River" 3) Pipa solo. Lord Lytton and other foreign guests listened attentively and were very happy, praising our country's music. The guests and hosts dispersed happily at about 7 p.m.</p>
<h3>Banquet by Various National Ministers</h3>
<p>British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, and French Minister Wild held a banquet at the Cathay Hotel at 8:30 last night to welcome the League of Nations Investigation Team. The following were present: Lord Lytton, Chairman of the Investigation Team; Mr. McCoy from the United States; Mr. Claude from France; Mr. Scotti from Italy; Mr. Schnee from Germany; Mr. Gu Weijun from China; Mr. Hirota from Japan; Secretary-General Haas of the Investigation Team; Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi; and consuls-general and naval attachés from various countries. They talked casually during the banquet and there were no important speeches. They dispersed at about 10 p.m.</p>
<h3>Staying in Shanghai for Several Days</h3>
<p>The purpose of this visit by the League of Nations Investigation Team is purely to promote peace in East Asia. If the Chinese and Japanese armies continue to take hostile actions after leaving Shanghai, wouldn't it violate the original intention? Therefore, it has been decided to stay for a few more days, hoping to do everything possible to mediate in the peace conference between the two countries so that they can see its success and the city can be restored before turning to Beijing and going north.</p>
<p>The University Association's Cao Gong Banquet for the League of Nations Investigation Team</p>
<p>Our reporter met with Dr. Schnee, the German member of the Investigation Team, yesterday. He said that the team has decided to stay in Shanghai for two or three more days due to environmental needs and is currently discussing it. Gu Weijun, the representative of the National Government, also said that the Investigation Team has decided to stay in Shanghai for several more days and plans to charter a merchant ship when it goes to Beijing in the future.</p>
<h3>Declining Invitations to Various Banquets</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team has declined all banquets due to the short time in Shanghai and the heavy workload. There have been many banquets recently, and there is no way to allocate time. Therefore, it specially requested Representative Gu Weijun to decline all banquets on its behalf so that it could concentrate on the investigation. After consultation with the reception office, it was decided to delete all luncheons from tomorrow onwards. The reception schedule has also been slightly changed. Today is still a luncheon for journalistic groups and a banquet for Representative Gu Weijun. The reception schedule for the 18th and subsequent days is as follows: 18th (Friday) Evening banquet by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, 19th (Saturday) Evening banquet by Vice Minister Song (8:30 p.m.) 20th (Sunday) Evening banquet by the Commander of the U.S. Far East Navy, 21st (Monday) Evening banquet by Minister Kong, 22nd (Tuesday) Evening banquet by the Pacific Society, 23rd (Wednesday) Evening banquet by the Bar Association.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Council Committee Holds First Meeting</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The 19-member League of Nations Council Committee, formed according to the League of Nations Council proposal of March 12, which specializes in handling the Sino-Japanese dispute, is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday (March 15, Reuters).</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 19-member committee elected by the League of Nations Council held its first meeting at 3:30 p.m. today. It was not open to the public. Chairman Simon announced that he had received a notification from Japanese representative Sato that a temporary agreement had been reached in Shanghai. The committee then decided to meet with Sato and Chinese representative Dr. Yan Huiquing tomorrow morning and hold a public meeting in the afternoon (March 16, Reuters).</p>
<p>London Foreign Secretary Sir Simon said in a speech in Norwalk last night that the public should not think that the League of Nations has not exerted valuable restraining power just because peace has not yet been restored. The knight also said that the results of the recent League of Nations Council meeting were largely due to the influence of Britain (March 16, Reuters).</p>
<h3>News from the Ceasefire Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>League of Nations Investigation Team Participation Issue</p>
<p>Chinese Chief Representative Sends Gu Weijun</p>
<p>The ministers of England, America, and France, and the Italian chargé d'affaires, exchanged views at the British Consulate General every day on the Shanghai ceasefire issue. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi visited American Minister Johnson at 11 a.m. yesterday. As for the British Minister Lampson, he only contacted him by telephone. According to news from the British Consulate General, the representatives of China and Japan and the countries concerned originally planned to hold the second talk at the British Consulate General yesterday afternoon, but it was cancelled. The reason is unknown. The League of Nations Investigation Team has now been invited to participate in the meeting. Because the team decided to stay in Shanghai to promote the ceasefire and arrange for the withdrawal of Japanese troops, the entry into Beijing has been postponed to the 26th of this month. However, Lord Lytton's assistants declared last night that the Investigation Team had previously stated that if the powers agreed, the Investigation Team was prepared to assist in the peace talks, but this matter had not been determined. The participation of the Investigation Team in the peace talks cannot be decided in Shanghai. In terms of procedures, an invitation must first be made to the League of Nations, and the League of Nations must seek the consent of the powers before it can instruct and decide. However, the Investigation Team believes that Shanghai can be restored to its original state (Reuters, Nanjing, 16th). The National Government has decided to appoint Gu Weijun as the chief representative of the Chinese side at the Shanghai Peace Conference.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported from Nanjing on the 16th that Vice Minister Guo Taiqi telegraphed the results of the Shanghai meeting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions on the 15th. The Ministry has replied by telegram. It is heard that the future of the meeting is that if the Japanese side can sincerely accept the good intentions of the friendly countries, there will not be any more twists and turns. It is heard that if the Chinese and Japanese representatives agree to hold a peace conference, the League of Nations Committee can still participate in the meeting before coming to Beijing.</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Shanghai on the 16th that a Reuters representative asked Dr. Gu Weijun whether he would serve as the Chinese chief representative in the Shanghai peace talks. Gu replied that he had to accompany the League of Nations Investigation Committee and could not take on this responsibility.</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Nanjing on the 16th that the Central News Agency reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had sent instructions to Vice Minister Guo regarding the Shanghai Peace Conference. According to the Chinese people from all walks of life here, if Japan is sincere, the peace talks can proceed smoothly. It is heard that if the Chinese and Japanese representatives agree to hold a peace conference, the League of Nations Committee can still participate in the meeting before coming to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Citizens Welcome League of Nations Investigation Team Posting Slogans</h3>
<p>Chinese and Western Police Interfere Arbitrarily</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Asks Public Works Bureau to Investigate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the General Office of the Public Works Bureau of the Shanghai Public Concession yesterday, saying, "We are writing to inform you that we have received a joint letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Citizens' Association on March 15, stating that Jiang Yunlong and Li Qiming, staff members of the Nanjing Road Chamber of Commerce, were dispatched to distribute slogans welcoming the League of Nations Investigation Team, but were arrested by Chinese police officers from the Laozha Gate Police Station. Also, Zhang Guangyu, a staff member of the Nanyang Socks Factory on Nanjing Road, was putting up slogans welcoming the League of Nations Investigation Team in front of the factory when he was chased into the store by a Western police officer No. 30, who beat him in the face until he bled, and then forcibly arrested him and took him to the Laozha Gate Police Station. After negotiations, he was released. Also, according to a letter from the Zhejiang Road Chamber of Commerce and the 27th District Citizens' Association, an apprentice from the Tianyuanxiang Silk and Satin Store on that road was putting up slogans welcoming the League of Nations Investigation Team at the entrance at 3 p.m. on the 13th when he was interfered with by Chinese police officer No. 1166. Not only did he tear up the slogans, but he also beat and intimidated the apprentice with fists and feet, and together with the Western police officer, copied the store's license plate. Also, Xu Chuanda and other staff members of the store were arrested on the road while distributing slogans to various members at 8 p.m. on the 13th, and were subsequently released. Unexpectedly, they were arrested twice again at 10:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. on the 14th, and two buckets of paste and brushes and two copies of the receipts of various shops were seized, and they requested negotiations, etc. The association has investigated that the League of Nations Investigation Team came to Shanghai this time to investigate the Japanese invasion of China. In order to show respect for international conventions and welcome the League of Nations Investigation Team, our shops and citizens in Shanghai have adopted a fair attitude and made faithful reports. On the day of the Investigation Team's arrival in Shanghai, bilingual slogans in Chinese and Western languages were issued, which were intended to uphold the spirit of international conventions and stop the violent acts of those who destroy the conventions, and to seek genuine peace guarantees for all mankind. It is an action for the common interests of mankind and does not violate public order, tranquility, or police regulations. Why does the Public Works Bureau want to interfere arbitrarily? Moreover, although the municipal administration of the Public Concession is entrusted to the Public Works Bureau due to international practice, the sovereignty of the landowning country has not been completely lost, and the Chinese residing in the Concession have not lost their nationality of the Republic of China. Why does the Public Works Bureau deprive the Chinese of their freedom to express their opinions in a peaceful appeal? It is incomprehensible. Even if we take a step back, most of the Chinese residing in the Concession have the obligation to pay taxes and should be legally protected. Now, the police officers of the Public Works Bureau arbitrarily insult and even enter shops and commit acts of violence without asking the reasons. They are obviously abusing their powers and violating laws and disciplines. Moreover, the Public Concession is a neutral area. Although it has been unfortunately destroyed by the Japanese's past acts of war in the Concession, we still hope that the Public Works Bureau will correct this malpractice. Now, unfortunately, the police officers of the Public Works Bureau who maintain public order have been found to be shielding the Japanese and bullying the Chinese, which is strange. The association is based on the position of Chinese taxpayers, and we hope that your association will forward a letter to the Public Works Bureau regarding the above-mentioned actions of the Public Works Bureau, raising serious protests and hoping to give a legal explanation and correction, and to ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future, and to order all police stations not to tear up this welcome slogan for the League of Nations Investigation Team again in order to maintain the goodwill of the Chinese and Western people and avoid causing other misfortunes. It is for the public good. Therefore, the League of Nations Investigation Team has arrived in Shanghai, and our country regards them as peace envoys and should welcome them legally. Your bureau has no right to interfere with our country's residents expressing their welcome. The Japanese used the Concession as a war zone and as a base for attacking our garrison, causing residents in the Hongkou area to be displaced, and their lives and property were lost. The Zhabei area was reduced to ashes, and the city's business was suspended, and Sino-Western trade plummeted. Your bureau did not interfere with it, but for some reason, it arbitrarily interfered with our people's peaceful expression of welcome to the peace envoys. In view of the foregoing, we hereby request that you investigate and handle it and reply, so as not to cause suspicion. To: The General Office of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau.</p>
<p>The Continental Newspaper reported that yesterday (15th), Mr. Zhu of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office also issued a public letter to all residents of Shanghai, explaining the feelings of the Chinese residents of Shanghai on this issue and criticizing the Public Works Bureau for failing to formulate regulations to allow the posting and distribution of such slogans and leaflets.</p>

<h3>Tea Party of the Two Madame Kungs and Madame Soong (Jointly Photographed by Li Zunyong and Li Ziyang)</h3>
<p>After the cessation of hostilities between the Chinese and Japanese armies in the Shanghai Incident, the frontline situation is reported to the League of Nations at any time for reference. The various ministers are currently working hard on the peace movement and have no time to leave Shanghai. Therefore, they have successively sent military attachés to Suzhou, who have then traveled to the west of Kunshan and the Taicang area to inspect our army's front line. The details of the visit are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>British Attaché Stewart: Mr. Stewart arrived in Suzhou on the 11th and has twice visited the Kunshan area, transferring to the front line to inspect the positions of our army on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line. Mr. Stewart has been in China for a long time and is very familiar with the situation in our country. When he went to the front line for inspection, our army provided him with all kinds of conveniences and was accompanied by senior military officers to various positions. It is said that on the 13th, he was personally accompanied by Commander Cai Tingkai to inspect the front line until returning to Suzhou in the evening. On the morning of the 14th, he took a boat to Changshu and transferred to the Taicang area for a front-line inspection. It was scheduled to return to Suzhou that evening, but as of 1:00 AM on the 15th, he had not yet returned. According to a phone call received locally at 11:00 PM on the 14th, all circles in Changshu County knew that the British attaché was going to Yu and specially hung flags to show their welcome, but he did not arrive at night, presumably because he took another route and did not pass through Changshu County.</p>
<p>U.S. Attaché Weyman: Mr. Weyman, the U.S. Army Attaché, and Mr. Raynoth, the Vice Consul stationed in Nanjing, came to Suzhou on the 12th and went to Kunshan on the 14th, transferring to the front line for a detailed inspection. After returning to Suzhou, they went to the airfield outside Fengmen to inspect the traces of damage and casualties caused by repeated bombings by Japanese planes. Huang You'e, the stationmaster of the station, accompanied them. After the inspection, Mr. Weyman and Mr. Raynoth took several photos for reference when preparing the report. At 12:55, they returned to Nanjing on a special car with Xu Kechang, the section chief sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to receive them.</p>
<p>French Attaché Hoberma: Mr. Hoberma, the French Naval and Military Attaché, accompanied by Li Gengkeng, a staff officer of the Shanghai-Nanjing Garrison Headquarters, and Wu Luxun, the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of the 78th Division, arrived in Suzhou by special car at 2:00 PM on the 14th. Mr. Hoberma has been in China for more than ten years, is very familiar with the situation in our country, and speaks Chinese quite fluently. This time, the French Minister gave him full authority to investigate the military situation in the Suzhou-Shanghai area. He is scheduled to go to Anting, Huangdu, and Taicang on the 15th for inspection, and expressed his advocacy for a fair resolution of the Sino-Japanese incident and respect for the League of Nations resolutions. That night, County Magistrate Zou, Foreign Affairs Secretary Huang Kejia, Police Chief Mao Naigong, Zhang Yuntuan of the Security Council, and Shi Junqing of the Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet for Attaché Hoberma at Liu's residence in Dingjia Lane. During the banquet, Attaché Hoberma also inquired about the situation of Japanese aircraft flying over Suzhou.</p>
<p>Italian Attaché: On the 14th, the Wuxian County Government received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the attaché of the Italian Embassy in China was scheduled to come to Suzhou on the 15th and transfer to the front line for inspection. After the inspection by the attachés of the four countries, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, they will report to the League of Nations based on their findings. The county government is preparing to receive them.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Gunfire at Miaohang</h3>
<p>It is Said to be a Japanese Military Exercise with Artillery</p>
<p>Yesterday at about 1:00 PM, refugees in the Wusong and Jiangwan area suddenly heard several loud booms of artillery fire. It was later reported by the Japanese side that the artillery fire was a Japanese army artillery exercise near Miaohang Town, and that a sound film was taken to be used for propaganda when returning to Japan.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Boasts of New Weapons and Equipment</h3>
<p>Claiming they were Used in the Manchurian and Shanghai Incidents</p>
<p>But in Reality, it is Just the Progress of Deadly Weapons</p>
<p>The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reported that the Japanese army held a grand celebration ceremony on the 10th anniversary. Since the establishment of the national army in the Meiji 6th year, the total number of various soldiers was 36,600, but now it has expanded to ○○. The progress of weapons is refined with the times. Compared with the weapons used in the Russo-Japanese War and the European War, the weapons used in today's Manchurian and Shanghai incidents are as different as heaven and earth. In the past, aircraft warfare was very immature, and armored machine guns had not yet been invented. Communication between units mostly relied on human messengers. Now, carrier pigeons, scout dogs, and wireless telegraphs are used for communication, so the offensive and defensive tactics have progressed by leaps and bounds. In the battle of Manchuria and Shanghai (note: Chinese troops did not resist in the Manchurian incident), the sophistication of our military equipment was superior to the enemy in every aspect. Now, the new weapons of our side that are enough to be shown off to the world are described as follows: 1. For infantry use, there are Type 38 pistols, semi-automatic pistols (capable of firing in bursts), light machine guns, heavy machine guns (capable of firing 500 to 1,000 rounds per minute), infantry guns, etc. (there are two types: direct-fire and curved-fire. Direct-fire guns are specifically used against enemy machine guns and tanks, etc., and curved-fire guns are used in enemy protective trenches.) 2. For cavalry use, there are cavalry guns and field guns. Cavalry guns are fast and light, and field guns can be used as mountain guns. 3. Attached to infantry and cavalry, there are armored vehicles, tanks (battle tanks). Armored vehicles are the vanguard of cavalry activities and are highly maneuverable, capable of traveling 30 miles per hour. Tanks have the power to defend against artillery shells, and their offensive power is even stronger. They are often used for assaults. 4. For artillery use, there are cannon (mountain guns and field guns), and flat-shooting shrapnel guns. The caliber is mainly 10 cm. As for the difference between field guns and heavy guns, one is a 10 mm cannon and the other is a 15 mm shrapnel gun. Shrapnel guns are used to destroy solid buildings. All the above guns can fire up to four miles. 5. Aircraft are divided into reconnaissance, combat, and bombing types. In the Shanghai operation, the effectiveness of bombers was the greatest. There are also anti-aircraft machine guns (for use at altitudes below 1,000 meters), machine guns (for use below 3,000 meters), anti-aircraft guns, etc. (capable of firing to distances of 4,000 to 12,000 meters). For the defense of aircraft, there are searchlights, airborne listening devices, and altimeters. 6. Although the use of poison gas is prohibited, all countries still secretly manufacture it. Due to the difference in their properties, there are types such as suffocating, tear-inducing, and blistering agents. 7. Defensive equipment includes three types: helmets, bulletproof gear, and gas masks. Helmets were not popular during the European War, but their recent use on the battlefield has been very effective. They are made of 1 mm thick steel with strong toughness. Bulletproof gear is used by lurking sentries and guards. Gas masks are divided into human and horse types.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Situation Along the River</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 16th, 8:00 PM Special Dispatch: Changshu Telegram, Qian</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>By the 16th, more than 600 houses of civilians in Jingpailou City, Xintang City, and along the river had been set on fire and destroyed by the Japanese army. More than 100 civilians were burned to death or shot. Along the river, every day at 6:00 PM, the Japanese army would land to stand guard and return to the ships the next morning. In Yanglinkou, many residents have been shot to death by the Japanese army in recent days for failing to meet their demands. Shops in Fuqiao Town are now open every day in the morning, and close after 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>News of Japanese Troop Redeployment</h3>
<p>▲11th Division to Leave Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>▲Japanese Soldiers Taking Over: The 11th Japanese Division has been ordered to return home, and the 14th Division and others have been dispatched from the front to take over. In recent days, a large number of troops have been shipped from Japan. From the 8th to the 14th, a total of 14 ships arrived, with about one division's worth of soldiers. They have been dispatched to Nanxiang, Jiading, and Liuhe. Two more ships arrived yesterday, carrying about 1,000 soldiers, as well as a large number of guns, cannons, and bullets. The Amomaru arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM, and the Fulangtemaru entered the port at 1:46 PM. Both landed on the Wusong side. Both ships remained in Zhanghuabang, preparing to load the 11th Division for its return home.</p>
<p>▲Troops Boarding Ships: A large number of infantry from the 11th Division were loaded onto 14 Japanese warships at Wusong, Liuhe, and other places. The cavalry artillery and baggage and equipment were transferred to commercial ships for export. Yesterday, three ships, including the Jiaozhimaru, transported a portion. The main force of soldiers and military equipment must set sail tomorrow. Tomorrow, the 11th Division will depart from Shanghai and return to Japan, using a total of 17 warships and transport ships.</p>
<p>▲Foreign Press Reports: The North China Daily News reported that in recent days, Japanese transport ships have loaded military supplies to Yunzaobang and often carried small teams of Japanese soldiers back home. However, there are still replacement troops arriving in Shanghai to replenish the strength of the units. Therefore, the total number of Japanese troops has not actually decreased much.</p>
<h3>Commander Yun's Speech on the Progress of the War</h3>
<p>Yun Yinglin, the commander of the First Regiment of the 78th Division of the 19th Route Army, led his officers and soldiers to participate in the battle in Jiangwan and other places, repeatedly defeating the enemy army and achieving remarkable results. He was also wounded in the leg and treated at Guangci Hospital. He has recovered slightly. Yesterday, he personally went to the Sixth Injured Soldiers Hospital on Meibaige Road to comfort the injured soldiers, instructing them to rest in peace, strictly observe discipline, and not fail the goodwill of the merchants and people who assisted them. Mr. Ding Mengxing, the founder of the hospital, hosted a banquet to express his respect, and invited Dean Yan Fuqing of the Red Cross General Hospital, Dr. Tan Yili, and Chen Dafang to accompany him. During the banquet, the host urged Commander Yun to report on the progress of the war. He briefly said that our army was then ordered to withdraw from Zhabei in order to quell the incident, but representatives of the people came to request that our army resist with strength no matter what. After a meeting, it was decided to serve the people's will and preserve the national territory as the goal. After the enemy replied to the peace conditions of the municipal government, they suddenly attacked us at midnight on January 28. After the start of the war, we received enthusiastic help and condolences from the people of Shanghai and telegrams from compatriots at home and abroad, which were highly praised. All officers and soldiers of our army had long embraced the determination to die, and at this point, they became even more courageous in killing the enemy. Therefore, no matter how powerful the enemy's weapons were, they rushed forward and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The encouragement of the people was indeed no small factor in being able to maintain for more than 30 days. Finally, the enemy increased to three times the number of our troops, and our army had to retreat to new positions and implement long-term resistance due to lack of reinforcements. However, when the officers and soldiers received the order to retreat, they could not help but cry bitterly, preferring to die. After the explanation of the superiors, they reluctantly retreated to the second line of defense. Commander Yun said to this point, expressing deep sorrow and wanting to weep, and some of the guests at the banquet had already shed tears. He continued, "The results of this battle show what our national character is, what the combat effectiveness of the army is, and people at home and abroad already know that it is unyielding. Even the enemy has experienced it. In the future, if our whole country can embrace determination and work together, the final victory will surely belong to us. This can be asserted. As for what the enemy's attitude towards us will be in the future, it should be known to everyone. The enemy has sent out many troops and sacrificed many lives and property, and has not gained much advantage. In any case, they are unwilling to withdraw their troops. We are willing to die rather than lose sovereignty. From this observation, we can understand the future trend. I hope that the people of the whole country will maintain the spirit of military-civilian cooperation and urgently carry out the second step of national salvation work." Finally, he represented thousands of wounded and expressed his gratitude. Then, a commemorative photo was taken at the hospital, and a commemorative medal with the words "People's Armed Forces" was presented.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Circled and Reconnoitered Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 8:45 AM yesterday, an enemy plane circled over Zhabei from the northeast for a moment, then circled towards the Public Concession, and then flew to Nanshi. At about 9:00 AM, another enemy plane flew from the north of the city to the south of Shanghai, and soon disappeared to the southwest. At 9:00 AM, people from Songjiang said that there were planes circling, presumably the ones that flew from here.</p>
<h3>Extradition of Li Mingzhong and Others</h3>
<p>▲Cao Weixian Released on Bail Pending Trial</p>
<p>▲Li and Others Plan to Appeal</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau requested the assistance of the Old Zhabei Police Station to arrest Li Mingzhong and 10 others in the Datong Hotel on Nanjing Road in the Public Concession for organizing the Southeast Self-Defense Army. Counterfeit official seals, letters of appointment, flags, documents, and various exhibits were seized. On Monday morning, they were escorted to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for investigation and clarification before further review. It has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Cao Weixian, one of the 11 people, has been granted bail by the court, but because no one provided bail, he is still detained with Li Mingzhong and others in the police station. The Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that the evidence in this case is sufficient and should be extradited and punished as soon as possible to curb the unrest. Therefore, when the Second Branch of the Higher Court continued to hold a hearing on the 15th, Jiang Shengtao, the captain of the First Detachment, and Wu Xiufen, an investigator, were still dispatched to the court in a Public Security Bureau prisoner transport vehicle to request the transfer. Subsequently, Yu Hua, the chief of the criminal court, together with Prosecutors Zhao and Guo, announced that the investigation of the case had been completed and the Public Security Bureau should be allowed to take the defendants back to the case for interrogation. Shen Yuesheng, the defense lawyer for the defendants, cited laws and facts to defend the defendants and opposed the transfer of the case to the Public Security Bureau for handling, but was ultimately not allowed by the judge. Therefore, Li Mingzhong, Li Xingwu, Li Zikuan (also known as Song Shizhang), Zhou Zishi, Zhou Hanchen, Yin Yuting, Wang Zhongren, Sun Yushu, Zhang Mingyuan, and Song Botao were escorted onto the Public Security Bureau's prisoner car and taken directly to Nanshi. Only Cao Weixian was temporarily detained by the police at the police station to allow him to seek bail. It is now heard that the defendants are very dissatisfied with the extradition ruling and plan to appeal.</p>
<h3>Relief Association Welcomes the League of Nations Investigation Team to Visit Refugees</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association has worked hard and rescued more than 100,000 refugees. It has set up 28 shelters. In recent days, the rescue of those in danger has been endless. It is heard that the association will lead the League of Nations Investigation Team, which is investigating the disaster in Shanghai, to visit various shelters, such as Tonghui School on Albert Road, Chengdu Road, and Jupplai Road, to provide the team with information on the real situation of the disaster and the suffering of the refugees.</p>
<h3>Wu Mai Escorted to Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲A Testament to His Family of Thousands of Words</p>
<p>Wu Mai, the propaganda director of the National Lawyers Association, was detained for going to the Public Security Bureau in the name of the legal advisor of the Secondary School Students Union and demanding the release of several detained middle school students, and having a conflict with Wu Zhiquan, the section chief of the Third Section. Last night, the central government secretly ordered the Public Security Bureau to escort Wu to Nanjing. The bureau sent police to take Wu from the detention center at 6:00 AM yesterday, put him on a ship, and sent him to Nanjing. After learning of the central government's secret order the night before, Wu drafted a family letter to his family, which was quite long, reaching thousands of words. It is heard that the National Salvation Joint Conference of various groups has sent representatives to rescue him from all sides.</p>
<h3>The Three Suicide Notes of Wu Deyao, Former Magistrate of Kunshan County</h3>
<p>Wu Deyao, the magistrate of Kunshan County, committed suicide by drowning in Jiaozhi, which was reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that his family in Shanghai has rushed to handle the matter and transported the coffin to Mudu, temporarily placing it in the Xin'an Guild Hall. At that time, Wu had three suicide notes, which are recorded as follows: 1. "Having been in Kunshan for more than a month, I have encountered national disasters and the local responsibility has become increasingly difficult. Recently, the army has gathered, and the Public Security and Construction Bureaus are not under my command, which makes me feel even more difficult. The hearts of the people and the world are unspeakable. I can only die to express my heart, Yao." 2. "There are letters in the small leather bag. Please ask Brother Weiting to entrust Director Xie and his colleagues to Fang Weilao and ask him to temporarily keep them and expedite their handling. Hasty writing, I can't express all my desires, Yao." 3. "The cost of clothing and coffins can be covered by selling my leather bag, watch, and bedding, or by notifying Brother Xingqu in Mudu by phone to send someone with money to handle it, and bring the coffin to Mudu and store it in the Xin'an Guild Hall."</p>
<h3>Record of the Annual Meeting of the Harmonee Business Association</h3>
<p>▲MacMickey's Accusations Against China</p>
<p>▲Editorial Correction by the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury</p>
<p>On Tuesday (the 15th), the Harmonee Business Association of Shanghai held its 84th annual meeting. MacMickey of Old Mow Hang was re-elected as chairman. In his speech, Mr. Mac said that the central government of China had again shown signs of division last year, and the Chinese authorities had failed to curb anti-Japanese activities, which had led to many of the current Sino-Japanese disputes. In view of these developments, consular jurisdiction cannot be abandoned, and a stricter plan should be adopted to protect the lives and property of foreigners and the state of trade in which foreigners are located. Mr. Mac then criticized the Shanghai Special District Court for its many delays in foreign litigation, for its too lenient sentencing of Municipal Council criminal cases, and for its frequent interference by Chinese civil and military officials, which has led to repeated injustices, which has also contributed to the Sino-Japanese dispute. He next criticized Chinese merchants for disregarding their obligations in placing orders, especially in recent weeks. He then mentioned tariffs, exchange rates, shipping, pilotage, bills of lading, the Chinese railways' discriminatory treatment of foreign goods, and the registration of foreign firms with the Chinese government. Finally, new directors were elected and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury published an editorial yesterday on the Harmonee Business Association meeting, stating that in his speech at the annual meeting, Mr. MacMickey, the chairman of the Harmonee Business Association, made many serious accusations against the Chinese authorities and the National Government in this port. These accusations were made on the first afternoon of the arrival in Shanghai of the League of Nations Investigation Team, which is working to determine the causes of the disturbance to peace in the Far East, and should be given special attention. Since there are no Chinese members on the board of directors of the association, the association cannot be involved in the Chinese side's arguments regarding the underlying causes of the Shanghai Incident. Mr. Mac's accusations against the Chinese authorities and the Special District Court are all involved in the Shanghai war, giving the impression that the Shanghai Harmonee Business Association and the Japanese authorities are on the same side. The chairman of the Harmonee Business Association is free to criticize the aspects he is dissatisfied with, but if he links them with the Japanese claim that these irregular actions justify Japan's use of force, and thus opens a precedent for future wars, then his words seem inappropriate. All problems can be found to have effective solutions, but the use of military force is not allowed. We only hope that Mr. Mac's accusations against China will not be seen as a complete endorsement of Japan's oppressive methods.</p>
<h3>Cosmetics Industry Cables for Relief Measures to Rescue Businesses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Trade Association sent a telegram to the National Government in Luoyang requesting relief for the industry's difficulties: To the Luoyang National Government, Ministry of Industry, Minister Chen Gongbo, and all members of the Central Committee: Since the outbreak of the 128 Incident, the Zhabei area has been the war zone. No less than 20 or so of our members' factories are within the Zhabei war zone. The devastation caused by the Japanese artillery fire and bombing has resulted in the loss of essence and the burning and killing is unspeakable. The direct losses suffered by our factories, in addition to the indirect losses, amount to more than 600,000 yuan in national currency, resulting in capitalists and more than 1,000 workers becoming unemployed refugees. If no relief measures are taken, not only will social security be threatened, but it will also have a great impact on the national foundation and people's livelihood. The people have the obligation to pay taxes, and the government has the responsibility to protect them. Now, our industry has suffered a terrible disaster, our property has been destroyed, we have been displaced from our jobs, and we have no way to survive. The association has witnessed the suffering and distress of our members, and therefore appeals and cables to beg for great compassion, so that the Suzhou merchants will be relieved and the industry will be maintained. The Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Trade Association bows.</p>

<h3>Rumors of a False Telegram on the Adams Steamer</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the staff of the Da Lai Company and the owners of the President Adams steamship are making every effort to deny that after the ship set sail from Kobe Port on Friday night, it received a wireless telegram from Shanghai falsely using the name of a certain person from the company stating that there was unrest in Shanghai and instructing the ship to delay its arrival in Shanghai for 12 hours, and that no such notice was posted on the ship. They also said that the ship was only ordered by the company to enter the port on the afternoon tide because the early tide was at 2:43 AM. The wireless telegram received by the ship only stated to berth at the Da Lai Pier and that the ship would enter the port on the Monday afternoon tide after arriving in the Shunlu Channel. However, passengers on the ship claimed yesterday that they personally saw a notice posted on the ship reporting that due to unrest in Shanghai, the ship's entry into the port was delayed, and a certain crew member also confirmed this, saying that he had read the notice and that he had been told by others that the notice was issued after receiving a wireless telegram from Shanghai.</p>

<p>▲The Number of Refugees from War Zones Arriving in Shanghai has Increased Sharply: After our army automatically retreated to the second line of defense, the Japanese army took the opportunity to occupy Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, Zhenru, Nanxiang, Huangdu, and Jiading County, and arbitrarily killed people and set fire to houses.

<h3>Partial Changes in Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>Inukai Concurrently Serves as Home Minister</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 16th: Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi decided today that after Home Minister Nakahashi resigns, he will concurrently serve as Home Minister. Yesterday, it was predicted that there would be major changes in the Cabinet. It was reported that Justice Minister Suzuki would be transferred to head the Home Ministry, and Finance Minister Qin Fengzhu would be transferred to head the Justice Ministry. As for the post of Finance Minister, it would be taken over by the former Governor-General of Taiwan, Kawamura. However, in the final stage, this plan was apparently changed due to disagreements among members of the Seiyukai party. Inukai will assume the post of Home Minister this afternoon. Since Inukai is concurrently holding this post, there may be no need to change other positions in the Cabinet.</p>
<p>▲Far East Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Japanese Home Minister Nakahashi resigned due to illness to avoid impeachment by the parliament for disrespectful behavior. The intended successor was initially Justice Minister Suzuki, but fearing opposition from the Tokonami faction, Inukai specifically visited Minister of Railways Tokonami Takeyuki to seek understanding. After Tokonami Takeyuki agreed, it was again opposed by Secretary-General Kuhara Fusanosuke of the Seiyukai party, so it could not be realized, and Inukai concurrently served as a transition, it is said.</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Singapore Port Construction Issue</h3>
<p>Should Hong Kong Build Fortifications?</p>
<p>Liberal Party Member Raises Questions</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 15th: Liberal Party member Mond raised the question in the House of Commons today whether Hong Kong should build fortifications. The member asked whether, if the Washington Convention and the Paris Convention were violated, the British government would be prepared to reconsider the treaty in which Britain undertook not to build fortifications in Hong Kong. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden replied that he could not state the government's policy on this matter. He felt that as far as members of the League of Nations were concerned, the Sino-Japanese issue was still under legal investigation. In tonight's debate, the issue of the Singapore naval base was raised when the naval budget was discussed. Navy official Wallace acknowledged that the situation in Singapore was not very satisfactory, and the Secretary of the Navy was giving it very close attention. He said that although the budget stipulated £7.75 million, the amount the British had agreed with contractor Jackson was £4,036,000. Even if the work contracted to Jackson was completed, the Singapore naval base could not be regarded as satisfactory. Jackson is currently carrying out his work and can complete it on schedule in 1935. However, the British government, due to financial difficulties, has not been able to build a completely and fully modern naval base in Singapore, which is why the Navy is anxious, he said.</p>

<h3>The Assassination Case in Japan is Gradually Expanding</h3>
<p>▲Confessions Involve Many Military Personnel</p>

On the 9th, Court President Miyagi and Justice Minister Suzuki secretly discussed and announced the assassins' motives, one of which was resentment of rural poverty and a desire to overthrow the established political parties and deny the existence of the wealthy. Most noteworthy is the confession that there are many military personnel participating in a group of over forty people, so how the judicial authorities will handle the case is a major issue. Also, the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reported that the creed of the Blood Pledge Assassination Corps includes that the group emphasizes chivalry, helping the poor, and challenging the capitalist class. Moreover, there are also famous figures behind it, such as Ito Shodo, Otsuki Yutaka, Kunii Michiyuki, and a certain party of famous sinologists, so the criminal department has begun searching for them due to the seriousness of the case. On the evening of the 8th, Police Superintendent-General Ono, in view of the terror and unease in the capital, ordered 10,000 police officers under his command to be on high alert. From the Superintendent-General down to the executives of the Metropolitan Police Department, they all set out together to patrol the streets, checking all passing cars and pedestrians, etc., the situation is very serious. On the one hand, it is pouring all its efforts into the extermination of left-wing and right-wing groups and a thorough search.</p>

According to his confession, he had visited Wakatsuki's private residence on the 8th, but because he did not meet him, he came to the headquarters. His speech was evasive, and he seemed to have the suspicion of assassinating Wakatsuki. The strange man suddenly attempted suicide on the spot, but failed. He is now being detained at the police station and strictly interrogated.</p>

Huang Shaoxiong, in addition to contacting the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi, was also ordered by the central government to return to Guizhou to organize a reserve army in preparation for heading north to assist. Huang first telegraphed Luoyang to take over the post of commander-in-chief of the reserve army, which read, "Supporting the telegram from President Wang Jiangkai on the date, the National Government ordered today, specially appointed Huang Shaoxiong as commander-in-chief of the reserve army, etc. Shaoxiong is humble and mediocre, at the time when the national crisis is in full swing, it is time to serve on the battlefield, the strength is actually unable to win, the righteousness is difficult to look back, the industry is scheduled to return to Guizhou within a few days to make a little fight, that is, the head is to Beijing, and accepts everything, Jingdian Feng Chen, I hope to see, Huang Shaoxiong Wei", Huang issued after the inauguration telegram, then at 4 pm on the 5th, accompanied by Secretary Zhong Shuren, came to Guangdong from Hong Kong, visited Li Zongren, and then went to Sanshui from Guangzhou on the 6th, took the wheel back to Guizhou, arrived in Wuzhou on the 8th, returned to Rong County first, and then went to Nanning to negotiate with Bai Chongdao on the establishment of a reserve team in Guizhou.
