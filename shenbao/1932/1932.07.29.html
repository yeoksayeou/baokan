<h3 id="c1">論華北形勢之危急　熙 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>熱河之局勢。邇日雖已暫告緩和。但關外日軍彎弓躍馬。劍拔弩張。其勃勃野心。固爲世人所共見最近華北方面。謡言頗熾。風聲鹤唳人心騷動。證之以日軍邇近之行動。如購買大批軍火。積極擴張軍備。如九洲大坂東京等處實行演習。如在鄉軍人組織移民義勇團携槍砲飛機向東北出發。如積極增調軍隊屯駐榆關。如駐津日軍黑夜演習巷戰凡此事實。殆無一不足以顯示日本軍閥之野心。正方興未艾。華北局勢日向嚴重之前途推移。殆無人可以否認。</p>
<p>就當前之情勢推測。日軍將來再度實力發動。勢必一面進逼榆關一面侵襲熱河。甚或繞道海州以大包圍之形勢。攻襲華北。吾人前已言之。平津而危則中原震動。故當前我民族實已臨到最後之難關。其嚴重其險惡。當更遠過於瀋變之時。</p>
<p>九一八之變。在彼負直接責任之軍事領袖。或尚可諉諸變起倉卒。其初不料禍機一發。而遂不可收拾。國人雖憂念國。難悲憤無地。但仍無時不準備出其死力。以爲抗敵將士之後盾雖然往者已矣。吾人但問當前之艱局究如何應付。未來之大難究有何準備。</p>
<p>就吾人之理性推斷。華北之軍事領袖。此時應亦已覺悟當前情勢與責任之嚴重。及其自身前途之出路。同時更悔恨其過去不抵抗之爲失策。假如能有此覺悟。有此悔恨。决爲中華民族效死。則眼前數十萬悲憤塡胸之健兒挾全國激昻慷慨之民氣。强隣要亦不敢正眼相看。而轉瞬暑退凉生。秋高馬肥。以數十萬義勇軍爲前鋒。進而討伐僞國收回失地雖成敗之數。未可定論。然而亦足以伸我正氣。耀我民族之光輝同時更以轉移國際之視聽。假使知而不行。覺悟而仍因循苟安。則其結果仍必至進一步之誤國。爲我民族永永之罪人。以故華北之軍事領袖。在此嚴重局勢之下。不僅應有最後之覺悟。而且應下最大之决心實際準備最後之抵抗</p>
<p>雖然。華北全國之華北也。華北負有直接責任之軍事領袖。固應下最後之决心。準備最後之抵抗。而中央則尤應統籌全局。禦侮衛國。準備萃我民族之全力作最後之搏戰</p>
<p>事急矣。舉國上下各盡其應盡之責。日來華北各將領齊集北平捐除私見。誠意共謀禦侮衛國此種覺悟。實爲我民族生命所利賴。吾人敢再四呼籲以促我舉國上下之急醒。</p>

<p>延吉通信知方</p>
<p>一會寗與圖們江</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>朝鮮北境有圖們江、隔岸可望我吉林省、沿岸有會寗、爲鮮北之大都、自會寗西走、達潼關鎭、有圖們西部線、｜即吉會線｜長可四十六哩、自會寗東走、達雄基、有圖們東部線長可八十六哩、此二線爲東滿與北鮮間之唯一交通大道、</p>
<p>西部線藉上三峰之國際鐵橋、相接於天圖鐵路、（自吉林之天寳山起、經老頭溝·</p>
<p>銅佛寺·龍井村·而達圖們江上之上三峯·）凡延吉一帶之木材榖物、悉由此線輸入會寗、再經朝鮮咸鏡線達淸津而輸出、固國境間之一大經濟綫也九一八以後、日人如醉如痴、紛紛自内地來滿、延吉一帶、木屐遍野、而此線之營業、遂更形發達、據調查所得、本年五月分此線之國境出入總乘客共計八萬三千餘名、較之昨年同月分乘客數之四萬千四百人、相差幾二倍强、</p>
<p>圖們江北岸、　我國原有東北邊防軍之國境守備隊員、駐紮其地由王德林統率之然事變以後、王德林率所部組自衛軍、出入於山林草莽之間、與敵相週旋、舊日岸旁兵舍、至今日已黃鹤樓空、而海關屯分所公安分駐所等地、已都爲叛逆所船踞矣「雕欄玉砌應猶在、只是朱顔改、」撫今憶昔、不禁暗然神傷、</p>
<p>二　局子街（延吉）</p>
<p>局子街爲日本所稱「間島」之中樞地、面臨布爾哈通河、距龍井村北端僅四里、局子街有居民一萬九千人、其中國人爲數最多鮮人次之、日人於本年三月以前爲數僅二百五十人而已、但據最近之調查、日人已由二百五十人驟增至八百人、其移民率速度之大、殊可驚人、故如我國不即速努力收復失地則不數年間、東北全土、將皆爲木屐兒所把持、造成其根深不拔之勢力、而陷我於欲復不能之境、該地於九一八事變以前、僅有日本料理屋一家、然最近已增至十二家、咖啡店已自一所增至四所、旅館自二家增至六家、雜貨商自二舖、增至五舖其經營之速、實令人咋舌不止、</p>
<p>據日方之調查、　謂局子街附近老溝頭之地價、原爲每坪（一坪合我國·○○五三八○五畝）一厘五毫、自日軍入境以後、每坪之價格、已自一厘五毫陡漲至四五圖不等云云、又聞局子街八道溝地方、已有金礦發見、而最近十數日前、咀呀河畔忽又發現極大煤礦、數日來局子街日本領事館、正在踏勘鑛脈、異日報告發表、日投資家必又將趨之若鶩、往昔我國置國富於不顧、致使今日坐視寳庫外溢、悲夫</p>
<p>三　龍井村與敦化</p>
<p>龍井村於宣統元年（日本明治四十二年）開闢爲商埠、當是時、該處僅有朝鮮人九十六户·國人五户之寒村、逮乎近日、已增至一萬八千餘人其中有鮮農一萬四千人國人三千五百人、日人一千四百人固一新興之都市也、</p>
<p>九一八事變以後、日本以守備隊與飛行隊屯駐該地、龍井領事館、并調徴朝鮮人爲自警團、用以與我自衛、軍相抗衡、</p>
<p>最近龍井村車站、（天圖鐵路）有「日軍來百姓朗樂」「日軍來了延邊甦生」「建設鐵路是成功樂土」等標語、張貼滿壁、辨其字蹟、察其文句、固極明顯的爲僞造東北民意者也、</p>
<p>龍井村之西北有敦化敦化爲高原地、該地居民、反日心理甚濃、故於去年六月以前、日僑僅九户（十八人）然至本年六月止、忽已增至二百二十二户、（九百八十二人）實較事變前澎漲四十二倍、再朝鮮人於事變前僅二十四户（百六名）最近已增至二十倍以上計五百三十户、（二千七百二十一名）、目前敦化之全人口、若合國人而共計之當已在三萬左右、敦化縣之全面積、爲三百七十五方里、已開墾者僅占全縣七分之一耳、且敦化附近、距牡丹江上游十四五里之地、有三大煤脈、此外尚有虎·豹·猿·兎·等出產、聞最近日人擬以「屯田兵式」開墾之、日本對於我東北、寢寐求之者已久、今一旦遂其大慾、無怪其狼吞虎嚥、而欲速下腹中也、</p>

<p>夥友俞瑞良受傷</p>
<p>有署名血魂除奸團者、前日以手溜彈置棉布業同業公會紗布交易所經紀人公會、予以警告、已見昨報、昨日池浜橋永昌煤號又發生爆炸事、</p>
<p>永昌舊事　新聲社云、新閘路七二九·七三一號永昌鴻記煤號、經理兼店主吳吉昌、規模在煤業稱中等開辦迄今、已有二十餘年、共雇店員十二名、工人四十名、係上海煤業同業公會會員、於本年一月十九日、全市煤業曾爲該煤號破壞愛國運動、串同英商麥賓洋行、妄報捕房、逮捕檢查　嚴斌、經大會議决罷業兩天、嚴斌經法院判决無罪釋放、始行復業、當將永昌煤號開除會籍、並驅逐市塲營業、</p>
<p>炸彈爆發　昨晨七時四十五分、該號已開門營業、忽見年約二十餘歲之靑年男子、身穿白短衫褲、手携一紙包、徘徊於該號門首、旋即將紙包拆開、用力擲入該號内、即行逃逸、轟然一聲、濃烟四起、店員俞瑞良、年二十七歲、浙江餘姚人、當塲股部被炸傷、流血不止、痛極倒地、全體工人店員、聞聲均驚惶異常、</p>
<p>捕房查察　經理吳吉昌、當日在樓上聞聲、下樓見狀、當即以電話報告新閘捕房、立即派中西武裝探捕六人、馳往查察、見七三一號西牆邊置煤球木板、炸成一洞、避太陽蓬布、查有三洞、脚踏車一輛炸燬、遺有尺餘彈繩一條、帶回捕房、以備澈究、並將受傷之店員俞瑞良、車送仁濟醫院救治、以傷勢尚輕、當即以紗布紥好出院、及至下午四時、股部流血不止、後由店主車送仁濟醫院醫治、</p>
<p>除奸團函　該號昨接有一函云、「永昌煤號吳吉昌知悉、今晨一個小小禮物、特爲你販賣日煤有功、此後你不妨繼續多多販賣、本團定有重賞、特此警告、上海血魂除奸團、七月廿八日、」又聞工部局亦接該團函云、逕啓者、敝團完全爲中國愛國志士所組織、紀律異常嚴明、惟一宗旨、在剷除販賣日貨奸商、對於本埠安寗、絶無妨礙、嗣後敝團行動、請勿干涉、到紉公誼、此致上海公共租界工部局、上海血魂除奸團謹啓、」又棉布公會曁紗布交易所聞亦接該團函云、「棉布公會常務委員會公鑒、昨上函及小小禮物、諒承鑒及、茲再鄭重警告、請於三日内、迅通告同業、並在本埠各大報封面、用大號廣告、表明不賣日貨决心否則本團認爲貴會無抵制仇貨誠意、决以嚴重手段對付、國難日亟、死生以之、上海血魂除奸團啓、」紗布交易所所接函略同、</p>
<p>賬房解釋　新聲社記者、昨晤該號賬房據云、一月間麥賓洋行逮捕檢查員案、實與該號毫無關係、至於同業公會開除會籍案、迄今尚未解决、此次確係外界誤會該號係奸商云云、</p>
<p>日貨跌價　紗布交易所經紀人公會、棉布業同業公會、先後接到炸彈警告後、昨日紗布交易所華紗價目驟漲、日紗價目忽跌、棉布市塲日本棉布竟大跌、幾無客顧問國、產棉布銷透轉旺、</p>

<h3 id="c98">日政府撥巨欵復興長江日輪 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>大批日貨昨日裝出</p>
<p>日淸江輪將開正班</p>
<p>國人對此作何感想</p>
<p>長江日本商輪、從一二八戰事起、即停班不開、僅有數船租給日海軍、作運輸軍實之用、日本退兵以後、長江日橋多往復業、惟日淸公司之江輪、迄未正式航行、日淸滬社社長米里紋吉、曾因此事赴日與總社及其政府磋商復興揚子江航業計劃、討論結果、第一須根本取消華人之抗日運動、第二則請政府撥欵贊助該社之復航、茲聞抗日問題、經上海日僑時局委員會、請駐滬領事、要求我市政當局、履行一二八議定之停止抗日條件、故於上海進口之日貨、昨日起、開始大批起裝出口、同時以政府之助欵允給該社之復興長江航業、亦得於八月一日起實現、並有跌價减費對同線之中外江輪競爭的辦法、亟將此事情形查誌如下</p>
<p>派班　日淸之長江班輪、本有二十餘艘、戰時全停、後將大福丸等租與海軍運輸、今該社已將租出各輪收回在長江一路内、暫時派定鳳陽丸·襄陽丸·南陽丸·等輪行駛滬漢正班而於宜昌重慶間、則派信陽丸開航、其停班已久之洛陽丸·岳陽丸·瑞陽丸·等船則俟長江日輪可以裝運中國貨客時、再定增加班次、目前先開數輪試航、而上江一帶、若漢口·九江·蕪湖·宜昌·等處各碼頭各分社之日本職員、在戰時撤退者今已照常派去復職、</p>
<p>裝貨　積存長江上游日本貨甚多、加以近日由東洋運來上海而轉往漢口等埠之日貨、亦載到不少、自二十七日起、日人不顧内地之抵制拒運、便將滬埠存儲之大批日本疋頭·與洋紙海帶雜貨等、開始公開的報運出口、統由日淸公司鳳陽丸裝去、一切報關等手續、由日本人自行辦理、第一批大宗東貨、往長江各埠、約共萬件、業於昨晨離滬、此爲戰後日貨運漢最多之第一批、其沿途起卸、則命海軍加以保護、</p>
<p>助費　日淸自二月一日停班以來、適足半年、營業上損失至巨據該社言、每月至少虧耗十五萬至二十萬、現時急謀復業、經日淸社長米里紋吉、向日本政府請求補助巨欵、爲長江日輪復興之資、茲得確訊、日本遞信省以長江航運、關係日貨消售、至爲巨大、已决定撥日金一百二十萬元、爲日淸復興揚子江航業之用、聞該欵已將發下、日淸即用以恢復江輪班次云、</p>
<p>跌價　長江日船復業、日人亦自知不易恢復戰前原狀、連日日商磋商恢復長江航業計劃步趨、聞已經擬定者、從八月一日起、航行長江之日輪、决計利用中國商民貪利之弱點、勾結奸商攬裝客貨、並將水脚照六公司定價秘密跌减、祇收半價、旅客乘船、更定减價辦法、例如上海往漢頭等價五十元者、日輪祗收二十五元、二三等票亦祇取半額、統艙客位、並爲有限制的免費乘坐、僅收些微票金、俟營業起色時、再行酌加、日人此舉、兼可使華商江輪受重大的打擊、聞復興期内之營業損失、日政府承認補助云、</p>

<p>據昨日徐家匯天文台報告稱、厦門汕頭間海濱一帶風狂浪猛天氣至爲惡劣、而颶風中心於昨晨六時許、方在距北緯二、十三度東涇一百十七度交點六十哩以内</p>

<p>工會呈報黨政請核辦</p>
<p>大公社云、本市香業工人四百餘人、因資方迭施壓迫、工人生活艱難、突於昨日開始罷工、工會已據情呈報黨政機關、茲誌各情如次、</p>
<p>工潮原因　香業工人工資、頗極輕微、工人平時度日、頗感艱難、工會方面、曾於去歲八月間、召集代表大會、推代表與資方接洽、要求改善待遇、資方屢加拒絶、旋滬戰發生、該項交涉、遂告停頓、迨停戰協定簽定、時局平靖、工方又推代表與資方接洽、未得要領、經由社會局二次召集勞資代表問話、僅到勞方代表、資方竟無人到局、致延未解决、最近各店資方、更陸續開除工人百餘名、南市閘北兩區工人、不得已乃於昨日起、一律自動罷工、工會方面聞悉後、當派員調查一切、並呈報黨政機關、以憑核辦、</p>
<p>要求條件　香業工人罷工後向資方提出要求條件四項、（一）資方不得無故開除工友、（二）要求資方月給工會事業費一百元、（三）資方不得藉口違背勞資契約、（四）工資及各種費用照原有一律增加四成、</p>

<p>聲明始終反對并未參加</p>
<p>請宣布購機合同及附件</p>
<p>交通部與美國馬凱公司訂報務合同事、交次陳孚木、因外間有人攻擊、曾在報端發表談話中、并涉及前交部電政司長李範一·及國際電信局長王崇植等、嗣李王先後辭職、王氏并有函致代交長黃紹雄、辭職後特致函陳孚木辯白、原函如下、孚木先生大鑒、敬啓者七月十七日在各報拜讀先生對於馬凱銀務合同之談話、旣多事實不符之點、又有侮辱他人之處、崇植以職務關係、守言不出位之誠故忍受之以待社會之公平判斷、乃二十一日申報又發表眞如先生致季寬先生一函、崇植不守紀律、應付懲戒聞悉之下、惶惑莫名、惟是非决不能爲威力所屈服、利害亦决不能用虚言以遮蔽、現崇植願以卸職之身、爲先生一陳之、</p>
<p>反對合同　（一）馬凱報務合同、崇植始終表示異議、最初於二月中卽電復先生、其文云、南京交通部陳次長鈞鑒、密眞電奉悉、查我國國際無線電通信借欵、糾紛甚多、計有中日之雙橋電台、中美之合衆合同、中英之西北三台等等各項合同、均許他人有獨占權、前年大部及建委會籌設國際大電台時、均以現欵購買機件完全自辦、爲避免引起外交問題之故又眞茹大電台正式通報時、日本以侵害雙橋電台利益爲言、曾提抗議、此其一、建委會大部前後與美德法菲等國訂立報務合同、今某美國公司自願投資、爲我國設台、其目的報務合同、此點與現行之中美報務合同、顯有衝突、此其二、國際大電台機件價格、尚不過昂而報費收入、獲行至巨、國内銀行及儲匯局、或亦願意投資、添購機件、此其三、職局存有得力風報二基羅瓦特兩架尚未裝置、王部長任内、曾擬加增電力至二十基羅瓦特、以供世界通訊、預算須洋三十萬元、可得大電台兩座、此其四、惟兹辜體大、以承鈞長垂詢、謹就管見所及、略陳一二、究竟如何辦理、仍乞鈞裁、職王崇植印、最後於六月二十八日、聞合同將簽訂復電達李司長表示反對其文云、急南京交通部李司長鈞鑒、密、聞馬凱報務合同有簽字說、此事日後付仲裁、我方必遭敗訴、旣喪國家體面、又損部長令名、中電人員、完全投機、何必上當、擬懇電達部長、請再加考慮、弟植叩、可見贊成簽訂者當另有其人、絶非崇植可以自信、</p>
<p>並未參加（二）當中美報務合同及購機合同簽字時、中國電氣公司恊理孫繩先生亦在座、迄兩合同簽字已畢、眞如先生始將中國電氣公司關於馬凱合同及無綫電話機之提議書一本、交與先生、同時孫先生復請部長切實批示、未言簽訂、當時部長詢李司長有何意見、李司長謂合組公司報務合同第十一條「兩造皆得自由與其他各國訂立無綫電報務合同、但不得違背本合同第二第三條之規定「其他各國、似指當事國以外之各國、今馬凱爲美國公司、若與再訂合同、恐有牴觸、應請法律專家審查、免蹈捷克司拉夫公斷敗訴之覆轍、致傷國家體面、關於話機、則謂技術問題、應交無綫電工程人員、詳細審查、部長謂然、此當時之實情也、先生所謂桌上、卽刊有上述四種合同之一節、以身歷其境之人、當知絶非事實、至馬凱公司補有負責担保函、謂崇榷亦稱極妥一節則國家行政、非一公司所能干涉、國家體面、亦非一公司所能担保、凡有常識者、皆應知之崇植雖愚、對於此種主張、從未有贊成之表示、</p>
<p>怱怱簽訂　（三）查馬凱報務合同及購買無綫電話機合同、據先生談話係於六月二十七日簽訂、查李司長於二十九日始行呈辭其病假期内代理者、則爲電政司第一科鄭科長、是則電政司始終非無負責之人、職權之行使、亦從未中斷、試問該兩合同之簽訂、事前未交付詳細審查、事後亦不交副署、而購機合同、亦不經國際電臺主管工程人員之審查、怱怱訂購、迄不宣佈、究係何故、（四）六月二十八日、陳秘書賀宗曾示崇植以馬凱報務合同之草案、（報務合同正本、僅於報端見之、至於購機合同、則始終未見）、雖有其事、但崇植當卽表示於合同根本不贊同、卽論文字、亦有不妥之處、經指出數處、當日並電李司長反對、初不料不經電政司卽行簽訂也、至先生謂該項合同、「卽由余帶部用印、除留部之兩份外、卽交與該公司收執」、則該項合同、交部方面、並無證人、何能交與該公司、且該項合同之用印、究在六月二十七日、抑在七月六日上午（李司長移交日期）、則傳聞異詞、苦無能詳、再問馬凱合同、（並有附件卽担保信）應請一律公佈、</p>
<p>僞國通報　（五）關於美國合組公司、與滿洲僞國通報事、曾經崇植迭次呈部、請示交涉辦法、同時交部亦曾電請原訂東北與美國通報合同之北平張主任、與該公司交涉、並咨由外部與美政府交涉、最近鄭科長曾面催外部歐美司劉司長速辦、則延緩之咎實非崇植所能獨負、且崇植於四月巧日六月巧日感日電部、請示交涉方針、未得一批先生時正代部、延緩之責、先生實負之、再美公司與僞滿洲國通報、我方認爲違背交部合同二三兩條之規定、美公司則認爲係繼續東北舊合同、並不背約、查合同第十條、凡對合同條文解釋有異義時、應付公斷、然因東北合同、早與交部現行合同衝突、而交部從未否認、而我國現亦與東三省通報、如提公斷、未必定能勝訴、故先從外交入手、此中複雜情形、先生個中人、豈能諉爲不知則停止通報云云、另訂馬凱合同云云、是否與原合同有所違背、是否故惹糾紛、</p>
<p>購機不公　（六）先生謂馬可尼機價、較諸中國電氣公司貴五萬美金不知有何根據、查訂購該項大電臺兩座機件、由西門子洋行法商長途電話公司美國合組公司中國電汽公司馬可尼公司五家公開開價、中國電氣公司爲十三萬八千美金、馬可尼公司爲四萬二千英鎊弱、（外加調幅機播音機眞空管三項約四千英鎊）約合美金十四萬八千元、約貴一萬美金之譜、但機件不同、比較不易、而先生談話謂報務合同贊同簽訂、購機則贊成公開標購、一似此爲不相關連之二事、豈先生於交部借英庚欵購機、及以中英報務合同之成否爲購機之條件、皆茫然不知者耶、實則稿經先生核定、案經行政院批准、固非空言所能轉移、至先生此次主張購買話機五架、價値三十餘萬美金、從未向各商行開價、與先生公開標買之主張似有未合、至該項話機在目下中國是否需要、交部有無財力、乃係實明顯之事實毋庸贅述、</p>

<p>輪舶交通、最要者莫如航行之標識、蓋交通首重安全、而標識即爲避免危險之要着、各國精研海事、無不悉心籌措計出萬全、我國沿海沿江亦早經陸續設置、而長江水道、猶時有變遷、故不能不益加愼重、我國關於航行標識、向由海關辦理、至光緒三十一年、海關又設巡江司、專任長江標識之事、其經過槪况、有足述者、本報特爲調查略誌於右、備世之致意航務者、知所考焉、</p>
<p>海關之兼理航行標識、其職掌蓋由於五口通商條約内有沿海設置燈塔、指示航路、由領事官與通商大臣商洽等語、維時我國則以海關本爲中國政府所設之機關、且科學技術、國人一時尚少精研致用者、故即委任海關辦理、初辦之際、用人甚少、蓋標識多寡、悉以水道之情形及航務之狀况爲標準、航務日繁、自加添設、三十年來、海關於此所用之人員、約略計之、長江上段、民國二年、洋員二人、華人燈塔信號人員三十四人、至民國二十年、洋員三人、華人内班辦事員三人、燈塔信號人員五十八人、長江下段、則光緒二十六年、小輪船員役十五人、燈塔管理員八十人、宣統二年、洋員專門技術者一人、普通船員一人、華人製圖一人、小輪員役三十一人、燈塔管理五十七人、民國九年、專門洋員五人、普通洋員三人、華人江務辦事員二人製圖二人管理水道舢板水手二十八人、小輪員役四十七人、燈塔管理二百零四人、民國十九年、專門洋員十五人、華人江務帮辦三人、辦事員六人、製圖六人、水道監查七人、修理雜務人員十五人、小輪員役一百二十五人、燈塔管理二百四十二人、水志表登記五人、迄於民國二十年、專員洋員十六人、（内四人告假）華人江務帮辦三人、辦事員六人、製圖六人監查八人、修理十五人、小輪員役一百二十七人、燈塔管理二百八十八人、燈塔管理之水手五十二人、登記員五人、其猛晉之程度可以見矣、</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語录</p>
<h3 id="c160">天生天聰 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>我們老百姓中了皇帝思想的毒可稱根深蒂固｜還記得咸豐年間有一位崇明的舉人去殿試複考。這複考的意義在查騐有没有作弊。考題是：「有心哉，擊磬乎」！考試的結果那舉人大得皇上之寵，咸豐下諭竟要以：「斯文永以爲法」</p>
<p>那時，吾聽得先生如此對吾說，吾心中非常納悶，吾就很大膽的問先生：</p>
<p>「咸豐自已難道也懂得八股麽他怎能知此文當永以爲法呢」？</p>
<p>吾的先生聽了，連連摇首，惶恐異常，對吾呼斥：「天子是天生天聰，你後生小子，那可以胡說亂道」足見當時對於皇帝，誰敢說一句壞話。皇帝的威風愈大，民族的怠惰也愈深。</p>
<p>如果根據「有德者有威」的原則，孔夫子早就應該做皇帝，然而孔夫子祇能做無冕帝王，後人祇稱他是「素王」，至於皇帝呢，他倒是天生天聰，是「天生孔子」。我們人民受了這種皇帝主義的毒，那裏會再有新思想，新智識百姓們個個惶恐人人在恐佈中度生活，誰再有創制的勇氣？所以中國人連造反也要假神託鬼，說是奉天行事。</p>
<p>其實中國歷代的皇帝都很幼稚，秦始皇可算是英明之主，並且有改革的思想，他居然能做到改封建爲郡縣的大政，然而他終於築了長城，想從拒絶匈奴於千里之外關起門來，高枕無憂！他也祇想做一個閉關的皇帝，而不想做一個拓殖的天下王。</p>
<h3 id="c161">淸凉散 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 錢台生</p>
<p>夏宜乎服一點淸凉的東西。然而。熱河又緊張了。却是一服極熱的興奮劑。</p>
<p>十九路軍抵抗的時候。恰巧是雨雪紛飛嚴寒冰凍。滴水成珠的時候。不必躱在戰壕裏喝冷風。從極低温度凍僵了四肢飢苦的戰土生活當中要拿起槍來。在雨雪中衝鋒。祗是躱在火燄熊的火爐旁邊。聽聽無線電中報告消息。雖在深冬。却一樣是温暖舒適。</p>
<p>但現在正熱到一百度以外的天氣。東北健兒在火熱的沙土裏。熱得能使人昏厥窒息的日光底下。在暴風一樣的彈雨裏。以自己生命的搏擊。去博得民族的光榮。雖然是炎光火熱的戰塲裏。能殺得多少敵人。便如服了一劑淸凉散</p>
<p>報載黑龍江敵軍三千多人。乘兵車一列經過高嶺子。被救國軍用貨車三節。預先放在山巓。兵車到時這三節貨車。由山坡上順勢滾下。頓時把十幾節的兵車當中。砸碎了七節。同時。車子裏的火藥爆發。死在這貨車火藥底下的。有四百多人。這一種殺敵方法。正如夏季服一服極度冰凉的淸凉散。但我們不能否認。上海人限能找舒服。摩登的時代底下。正不乏香凉可口的淸凉散。對日軍覬覦熱河的興奮劑。至少是像東北一樣。看它沉淪近年漸漸的視若無覩。呌人怎樣能夠相信我們能有翻身的一天呢。</p>
<p>遺佩環　六月二十三日晨醒不能成夢念明日素蕖生辰矣凄然賦此即題大千居士爲畫白荷丈幅上睡老鴛鴦不嫁人畫中錄天池句也　玉岑</p>
<p>客庭月落。又枕邊驚失。粉衣如玉。未冷秋河。不信星辰。比似淚珠難掬舊情欲逗遵簪訴。怕單舸輕離原錯。負亭亭江上開時。睡老鴛鴦人獨還憶留仙裙皺。早西風私警凌波心目靑　菱花。一夢輕塵。暗　華年如轂拗絲藕盡心蓮苦。贖刼後枯香都薄。付韋郎今日迴腸。未抵犖蛾雙蹙。</p>

<p>— 王羽</p>
<p>說者多謂年老者有暮氣。不足與言殺敵救國。實則亦不盡然。暮氣與朝氣之别。絶不可以年齡之大小爲標準。今之頽廢靑年。日惟浸淫於影戲跳舞之塲。以談情說愛作性的追求爲第二生命者。實即爲暮氣所籠罩。更不足與言殺敵救國也張仲仁之欲組老子軍。雄心勃勃。髣髴廉將軍猶能强飯。馬伏波再出據鞍。雖未能眞個成軍。要亦爲富有朝氣之表現。而愚所聞湖南人任福黎則尤視張爲更有朝氣。老年人誠不能一槪而論也。福黎。年七十矣遜淸翰林。曾爲御史。風骨遒勁。以敢言著。甲午之役。憤日本横暴。請纓赴前方。展轉於硝烟彈雨中者若干日。而淸師卒熸。回天無術。旋又以某事抗疏。大迕孝欽。遂罷歸田里。每以外侮頻來。國事日非爲恨。孰意日本愈逼愈緊。横暴尤甚於昔。竟無端以武力佔我東三省。福黎聞耗痛哭流涕曰不圖以就木之年。又睹河山破碎也又謂其子曰。我老矣。死不足憾。但不甘兒輩爲亡國奴。在異族手中討生活耳。分當與倭奴一拚。苟政府實行武力收回者。我必易戎裝赴敵。雖爲一小卒。亦所甘願。詎俟之久。政府絶無出兵意終日書空咄咄。幾廢寢食。遂自擬陳情書一通。力言非出兵不可。洋洋萬言。親自間關來京。呈於當道。其子竭力諫阻。並願代親呈遞。不聽也。嗚呼。若而人者。其能謂爲年老有暮氣耶。</p>

<p>— 黃人</p>
<p>亞　當天樂園的原址英國蘇塞克司Ｓussex府。雖然常被一般文學家著作家以文章讚美。詩歌詠歎。可是没有人敢說這風物幽美的府治。却是人類始祖亞當與夏娃Ａdam　and　Eve的天樂園Ｇarden　of　Eden的原址這是美國考據專家費了許多心思所考據出來而認爲確切不移的。據他說。凡是歷史以前的遺蹟。見於考古或科學的記載的。大半都不是眞的東西。惟有那人類的始祖第一個眞的男子亞當確確實實是住在蘇塞克司府。考他的年代。約在距今一百二十五萬年以前。那時的世界尚未開闢。當然到處是榛莽。到處是荆棘。而在這遍地的榛莽與荆棘之間横行著的。完全是猙獰可怖的猛獁。與牙齒加利刃一般的虎豹。亞當東躱西閃。要保全他的性命。大槪也煞費苦心。正與現代住在都會中間的我們。在街道上忙著躱逃汽車一樣呢。</p>
<p>英國鮮菓業之王　四十年前。英國有一個十一歲的窮小子。向他父親要了三個便士。不去買點心或糖果吃。却買了十二束的櫻草。當晚他就在街上賣掉了。每束賣一便士。一共賺進了九個便士。他歡喜得了不得。從此就在植物上如何掙錢著想。有一次得到了幾顆豌豆子。種在他家的小園子裏。一年多以後就得到了幾千顆的豌豆秧。一起都賣掉了。十四歲時。他便從事於鮮菓業。十七歲時。在愛佛歇Ｅversham城中開設了一爿很大的鮮菓店。居然做起大老鬮到十九歲那年。已做了一家大鮮菓公司的總經理了。他并且得了一個「醋栗王」的頭銜（按醋栗爲一種鮮菓之名英名。爲Ｇooseberry)因爲他每天可輸出醋栗一百十四噸。打破鮮菓業中的記錄。此人是誰。便是現任國家罐頭食品公司的董事長兼總經理史梅德來氏。Ｓ·Ｓmedley手下有職工三千人。聽他的指揮。</p>

<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>（一）（二）機製紙盒工廠</p>
<p>紙盒爲裝置商貨用品必需之物。上海機製紙合廠。多至千餘家。蓋資本小。銷路大易於籌設。規模大者。有三陽路之周同興。老北門之茂泰祥　寳興路之王聚興吳金興　興等虹口一帶。亦有大者往時鴨綠路等處。有日廠數家。自我國民衆抗日後。相繼收歇矣。</p>
<p>盒廠之興衰視乎攬得之主顧本身營業而定如攬得皂廠襪廠食品廠等。則該盒廠之發達可期矣。惟近時大工廠等。鑒於利權外溢。往往自行製造。若永和家庭等廠是也。其製盒連印刷者。現祇茂泰祥聯興二家耳。</p>
<p>製盒機器。有切紙車。掛線車二種。切紙車。視所切之紙式不同。故切刀亦不一式。掛線車。將黃板紙照線劃有刀痕。以便易於摺糊。切紙車。每部價洋三十餘元。掛線車。每部價洋一百二十元左右以上海七浦路合興機廠。製造最有名。</p>
<p>製盒原料。黃板紙卡紙縐紙等。黃板紙多國貨。如金熊牌鳳凰等。卡紙係西洋貨。縐紋紙向係日貨。近則大都改買美貨矣。惟價値較昂。</p>
<p>每機每日可出皂襪盒等。二千隻上下。盒之貴者。每隻有價洋一元餘者。賤者每千隻三元而已。</p>
<p>至製造捲烟盒則情形大不相同。如五十包裝。二十五包裝之紙糊大烟盒上項盒。廠可以製造。他若十支裝之小烟盒。不但所用之機器與工作手續不同。况非有一二萬金。不能設廠也。</p>
<p>古廟敲鐘錄（五八）</p>
<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>六十五</p>
<p>古　廟兒童一年計畫是古廟每個兒童的一年計畫，也可說是古廟全體兒童的一年計畫。計畫上所列的事是每個兒童所做的事，如果每個兒童都依照計畫去實行，那末個人成績的總和便成了全體的成績。</p>
<p>計畫裏所列的事是最少限度。本事大一點的孩子儘可多做幾件事或是每件事多做一些。萬一能力夠不上，就是這最低限度也做不了經過審查之後也該有通融辦法。</p>
<p>這個計畫是一個試行的草案。因爲第一次定這計畫，大家都没有充分的經騐，决不能定得十分正確。有的分量怕是定得太高，有的分量怕是定的太低。我們可以一面試行，一面將缺點紀錄下來，以爲修正本年計畫或重定來年計畫之參考。</p>
<p>計畫是爲人定的：人不是爲計畫生的。如果計畫行不通，或是勉强實行面於人生有害，我們儘可以提出修正。我們寗可爲小孩而犧牲計畫，决不爲計畫而犧牲小孩。不過計畫是大家共同所定的，修正也得由大家共同通過個人覺得計畫上有缺點時儘可向大衆提議討論，决不可任意行動。</p>
<p>日常生活中如吃飯睡覺不須天天提醒的，就没有列入計畫。日常生活中之須改善的如洗澡，喝荳腐漿之類在計畫中是大　而特　。大家對於喝荳腐漿是免不了懷疑吧？我告訴你：「乳白荳腐漿，勝過人參湯：喝到肚子裏，爽快而健康。」你若不信，試他一試吧這些新事等到由習慣而成自然的時候，我們又不必將們列入計畫了。</p>
<p>這次計畫中有一個特别重要之點就是合作。你看種菜，栽樹造路，滅害蟲，敎别人做學問，賺錢援助東北，都是運用衆人的力量造成公共的成績。一個人的成績雖少，若積　多自然大有　觀。</p>
<p>我們自從定了這個計畫之後，越發覺得學校與社會必須打成一片，纔能發生偉大的力量。我們討論的時候發見村莊裏有許許多多的事要做而小學生只能做到一部份。那一部份的事可以擱置起來嗎？如果擱置起來，連小孩的生活也不能健全。我不說别的只說一樣。古廟的人吃的是髒水而且連這髒水也不夠吃。我們若想每個小孩子長得豐潤洗得淸潔，百草千花與孩子們一樣的欣欣向榮那就非開幾口大井不可。開井是辦學的第一件大事，可是這開井的工作决非小孩們所能勝任像這類的事是有許多。我們已經下了决心不使個人逃出生活敎育之網。小孩子的力量旣夠不上做這種工作朱先生便想到靑年農人的頭上去。靑年的農人上將農村變成樂國將地獄變成天堂，你們是負有這個使命在小孩子的前面領導着。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>據昨日報載,有兩種消息,令人十分疑惑,兹特提出如下,</p>
<p>（一）據津訊,駐津日軍二十七晨,向北寗路素車四輛,裝藏袋十萬條,及電網無線電機軍用鴿等,赴榆關,又平電,近日日方沿僞奉山路,布置軍事,極爲嚴密。</p>
<p>（一）據路透社二十七日北平電，此間當局，否認瀋陽與上海所傳，張學良之軍隊，現由熱河推進並，屯集滿洲邊界之說，謂張軍並未移動，此項謡言，毫無根據。</p>
<p>現在日方預備侵略行爲，十分積極，而北平當局，尚拼命否認移動這是何等可憐而可悲的事呢，惟據友人言，張學良之態度，近日大爲一變，口口聲聲說誓死抵抗，旣如此，何以張軍向熱河推進等等消息尚，加否認呢？</p>
<p>大約小張的方針，眞是改變了，從前主張不抵抗主義，大爲世人吐駡，故現在摇身一變而爲抵抗主義，好在口頭儘管抵抗，儘管按兵不動，那不會再受世人吐駡了，但是世人又要責難，旣經主張抵抗，爲什麽按兵不動，他又可把自己的軍隊調動調動，或者去墾了幾條戰壕，總算是一種防禦工作，這也可算是抵抗了</p>
<p>所以抵抗有兩種，一種是口頭上與形式上之抵抗，一種是實力與精神上之抵抗，不知張的抵抗，到底是取那一種呢古德又言曰，始我於人也，聽其言而信其行，今我於人也，聽其言而觀其行，因爲現在滑頭麻子眞多，往往口是心非，大言欺人，他的說話，實靠不住，我到要揩揩眼睛，看他一個究竟哩！</p>

<p>公式Ｃr分子量５２</p>
<p>鉻是一種光亮晶體的金屬，它在平常温度，不感任何作用，而且在火燄Ｏayhydrogen　Flame裏，也不會溶解，但如遇到電弧光Ｅlectric　arc，它便化成了液體，這金屬也是非常難分析的一種，大約要加熱到三千度光景，纔起溶解，它在高温度的空氣中，就燦爛地燃着，它還有四個原子價，｜｜二三，六，和七，如其原子價爲二，那末它是鹽基的造成者baseFormer，如其原子價爲三，那末它是强的鹽基造成者，如其原子價爲六，那末它是酸基的造成者Ａdid　Former，如其原子價爲七，那末它是强的酸基造成者，雖强有　化的硝酸，和　也不發主變化及作用，不過硫酸和氣酸，確都能使之溶化，並放出　氣，留下含鉻的鹽質。</p>
<p>大概混合金屬·由富於動性的金屬組成者·而且非常不易受到感化的。多含鉻譬如鐵同鉻攙和便變爲其硬無比的一種鋼·百分之十二到十四的鉻·或者也呌爲不著色鋼Ｓtainless　Steel，用做刀之類·就非常地堅硬耐用，就是市面上有買的所謂不銹刀是。</p>
<p>和鑠Ｎickel用，做鋼盔，胄甲，戎衣，盾牌，可以抵禦槍彈，像一二八事件，我十九軍壯勇之士兵，因缺乏此種衛身物而犧牲者，爲數實衆，而日兵之因有該種鋼盔而得護其頭腦以不死者。也不在少數，可哀孰甚，我中國人之缺少科學常識，竟一至於此，噫，氣化鉻，用做油漆，有永不退色之妙，硫氣化鉻用以硝皮功效最好，古法須八月硝成一襲者，現只須四小時，而成績亦較佳數倍，所以在現代的工業界上，已佔了重要位置，並且也用做定色料，還有幾種酸基的鉻，也可用做顔料。至於鉻的製法計有三種：</p>
<p>一，國而區密脫法Ｇoldschmidt　Process｜｜使三氣化鉻和錩還元即得</p>
<p>二，放木炭及三氣化鉻入一石灰鍋使劇烈燃燒即得</p>
<p>三，用鋅Ｚinc還元即得。</p>
<p>鉻並不存在自然界，不過含在幾種。去年今夏不相同，短襪短衫大出風，一樣遮陽花樣變，衫長足赤露其中，（佛題）</p>

<p>— 宜興</p>

<p>再說平常人們的往來禮物吧，大都視人的榮辱，不顧交情的深厚，要是你是個紅人物，泛泛亦都爲重禮厚饋，冀得附炎爲榮，甚至地方土痞，鄉村圖保竟藉視爲營業者，常無緣無故做什麽陽壽哩，陰壽哩，歲無不舉，年無不行，藉此爲收一批禮物。｜銀錢與物品，｜更有聲望的，還可大大的敲竹槓，打秋風，進益許多，習俗至此，流弊無窮，欲言者已久，今趁本埠增刋有改良社會討論會之設，願以此問題貢獻商榷，我對於以後送禮的改良辦法，應該這樣：</p>
<p>（一）無論碰到什麽婚喪喜事，如送金錢的，最多不得超過二圓以上。</p>
<p>（二）要是送禮物的當以實用的，而不糜費多量的金錢爲限。</p>
<p>（三）如喪事人家，要是本人到過，親自致祭拜奠以後，本可以不必再送什麽東西，蓋親自祭奠，其情義之隆，實超於物質金錢什百倍。萬一懷念故人情猶未已，則可費數毫之貲，寫輓聯一付，懸之靈前其情亦至。</p>
<p>（四）做壽本可不必，惟爲紀念人生過程的一叚落起見，不防每十年或廿年，做一次紀念，聚親戚朋友於一堂，未始非人生快事，但就此藉此收受人家禮物，自屬不當，應該不送也可萬一交情深些，要留一些紀念，那末當以足可留以紀念，而無富貴化的東西爲是。</p>
<p>（五）其牠什麽陰壽哩，做功德哩，這些無謂的舉動，儘可不聞不問。</p>
<p>以上是我想像改良的辦法，致於根本最好的方法，就是能夠不以金錢爲送禮的要素，可是在積俗之下，驟改自然不能，所以先以此數則爲過渡中的改良辦法，得當與否，賢明者有以正之。</p>

<h3 id="c187">小弄巡禮 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 增庚</p>
<p>夏日的晚上，鴿籠式的屋子裏，實在受不住悶熱，可惡的蚊子，又是包圍了四周，嗡嗡的實行猛烈進攻，所以不得不脫離樊籠，向那街頭巷尾，得一些風伯之惠，舒暢舒暢悶熱的身子，</p>
<p>這是個狹狹的小弄，暗暗的幾盞電燈，發出無生氣慘淡的光芒，燈罩上已結滿了蛛網，燈泡更是變成了黃色，牆壁上的石灰，已一塊塊的剝了下來，靑苔是生滿了牆脚根，汚氣觸鼻的陰溝，通了這整個的小弄不過，所有的汚水，已停止流動，細細的孑孑，繞繞的在水中浮動，這一切，已夠這昏暗的小弄寫照，</p>
<p>地下一堆堆的躺着人，有的在閒談，有的在賭博，有的已沉沉的入夢了，「一馬離了西凉界……」一個工人如的朋友，躺在地上擺着脚唱他的對面，有一堆人蹲在蓆子上賭牌九，</p>
<p>「西裏花拉」，一陣理牌聲莊家就把脖子一抛，口中唱着，</p>
<p>「七觸，天門第一觸，莊家第三觸。」</p>
<p>喊過後，七手八脚，四五個人，都伸出他們粗大的手，各人抓了一付，</p>
<p>「哦，斷！斷！…唉，操那，勿爭氣！」在天門的那個漢子，把兩張竹牌</p>
<p>疊在一起，慢慢的抽了開來，嘆了一口氣，</p>
<p>「喂，阿五，啥物事；」在左邊的問，</p>
<p>「操那别十」天門的朋友說，一付牌結束，莊家吃了兩家，賠了一家，片刻又繼續他的賭博，「喂，和尚，啥物事？」阿五問着在右邊的那個，</p>
<p>「不好，人三和尚敲木魚，」和尚回答，</p>
<p>「呵呵，和尚碰着和尚，眞巧，」莊家笑着說，</p>
<p>「喂喂，三道頭和阿三來了！」一個小孩，從弄口跑了進來，很急促的說，於是賭博的一堆，一陣紊亂，趕忙把錢放在袋裏，把牌放在蓆子底下，一個個裝着很泰然的在閒談，弄口走來了一個外國巡捕和一個印度阿三，，慢慢的踱了過來，向弄裏兩旁的人看看</p>
<p>「加得里馬得里賭銅鈿到行裏去印度阿三微笑對這一堆人說，</p>
<p>「阿三，阿拉没有賭銅鈿，」和尚嬉皮笑臉對他說，</p>
<p>巡捕走後，他們仍拿出賭具，圍在一堆賭博了，别十，至尊，天槓，地槓的聲音很雜亂的在那小弄的一角響着，小弄的盡頭，兩個老婦在談話，</p>
<p>「三婆婆，今朝天氣柴熱拉！」一個老婦帶着寗波口音說，</p>
<p>「勿錯，張老太，天氣熱得來，」另一個操着蘇白說，</p>
<p>「三婆婆，儂福氣柴好東拉，三個兒（讀三音）子，個個會賺銅鈿，大媳婦又能幹，二媳婦又孝順，三媳婦又縹緻，眞是前生修得來的，」張老太很羡慕的說，</p>
<p>「喔唷，說得好，不過多幾個氣泡罷了，」</p>
<p>「拍！」張老太用手打了一下臂搏，駡道：「阿媽西劈，倒運蚊子，眞討厭！」駡後，仍和三婆婆在閒談，在靜靜的空氣中，只聽得她們輕輕的對話，什麽眞命天主，玉皇大帝，早抱孫子等的俗話，一句句刺入我的耳膜，時常還聽得張老太的拍蚊子聲，和「阿媽西劈」的駡聲，</p>

<h3 id="c188">可愛的上海？ <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>「啊！上海，可愛的上海！」</p>
<p>一艘汽艇像箭一般從水面上飛來，隠約是一羣都市男女，這曼妙的歌聲像</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>黃　一樣好聽飛進了我耳朶。</p>
<p>我立在大建築物下若有所感，上海是否可愛，祇要做過三個月的上海人，就知道牠是一個患著惡毒性病的妓女；雖然表面是妖迷動人，</p>
<p>據海關水巡捕房報告，上星期内，浦江中撈獲浮屍十餘具之多，而細究投浦的背景，不外</p>
<p>（一）經濟壓迫</p>
<p>（二）失戀自殺</p>
<p>其他僅少數而已</p>
<p>上海有高大的建築物，夜花園跳，舞塲……對於享樂的醉生夢死者，當然不失爲可愛的地方，但生產落後，敎育不普及的我們老大國，能一天忙到晚而不得温飽的，已是大幸，滬戰以後，更增添了不少的失業朋友，經濟壓迫就完成他們的投浦自殺，這不過消極的一種人，積極的初則藉賭博以圖僥倖；繼則墮落而爲强徒，於是上海變做出門就有生命危險的匪窟，</p>
<p>環境不良，可以改變人們的個性，女子是天生崇尚虚榮的（據生理學家說）於是戀愛問題在上海變做性的交易所，而當事人都像戴了著色眼鏡，不知处自拔，因爲他們所看見的上海是這樣的上海，更有許多影片無聊小說，明白的顯示戀愛不過支票而已，</p>
<p>「乏味的人生啊！」一般靑年高聲狂呼，終於他們做了幾首艶詩則黃浦裏去今日報載本埠新聞人犬性交一則，是一個被壓迫的十一歲幼女，這種慘無人道的行爲，竟在光天化日之下發見，可見上海已無地（？）格（和國格，人格同解）</p>
<p>出錢的大老官，享受過上海的一切，而没有瞧過這種新奇的把戲化六塊錢不在他們心上，殘害幼女的生命，更與他們痛癢無關，陳新齋化錢買了一個女子，當然相在上海人好奇的腐化思想中高價賣出去這一幕人犬性交的怪劇，不知唱「啊！上海，可愛的上海！」的密司心中作何感想？</p>
<p>啊！上海，可愛的上海？</p>
<p>天說地</p>
<h3 id="c189">女浪男藏 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 鴻綬</p>
<p>時代像幻形般的變化着，一切的一切都是刻不容緩地過去。以前認爲金科玉律的古訓，一樣一樣地反了過來。人們也受了時代的麻醉和浸溶，忘却其所以然，時過境遷，反覺今是而昨非。難怪幾位前輩老先生要深深嘆惜。</p>
<p>翻開閨門訓一看，簡直要把文明人的嘴都給笑歪。爲什麽呢，時代而已。但是什麽又是文明呢誰也不能說文明原是一件空泛的事？也許現在以爲是文明得了不得的事，到了幾千百年之後，也給那時更文明的人笑痛肚子呢。</p>
<p>從前有句老話呌做男要浪女要藏，什麽意思呢，就是說男子要向外，女子要躱在家裏，深居簡出，光拿衣服而論，以前的女子出門時裙幅要遮到脚尖，纎手也不輕容易給人看見。若是一個女子在街上亂跑，那簡直是笑話。時代不同了！女子赤手露臂，裸足袒胸，解放到了極點。一部分的女子整天在外亂跑謂之交際，男子却依舊長袍長褲，除了一顆頭必須呼吸和二只手必須做事之外，其餘完全裹在衣服裏，這件事現在倒是中外一律的。你看外人在平常或逢到宴會，男子總是穿得硬綳綳的（謂之挺）女子却是愈露愈妙，這是事實。</p>
<p>我眞不明白爲什麽男子這樣笨，不知道解放，張滄粟君在本報發表的改良男子服裝建議，我很贊成，我還希望更解放些，讓我們男子也來浪</p>

<h3 id="e1">On the Perilous Situation in North China　熙 <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Although the situation in Rehe has temporarily eased in recent days, the Japanese army outside the pass is poised and ready for action, their ambition obvious to the world. Recently, rumors have been rampant in North China, causing widespread panic. This is evidenced by the recent actions of the Japanese army, such as purchasing large quantities of munitions, actively expanding military preparations, conducting exercises in places like Kyushu, Osaka, and Tokyo, organizing volunteer immigration groups of veterans carrying firearms and airplanes departing for the Northeast, actively increasing troop deployment and stationing them in Yuguan, and the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin conducting night combat exercises in the streets. These facts are more than sufficient to demonstrate the burgeoning ambition of Japanese militarists. It is undeniable that the situation in North China is moving towards a more serious future.</p>
<p>Based on the current situation, it is reasonable to speculate that the Japanese army will launch another forceful action in the future, inevitably advancing towards Yuguan while simultaneously invading Rehe, or even detouring through Haizhou to encircle and attack North China. As we have stated before, if Tianjin and Beiping are in danger, the Central Plains will be shaken. Therefore, our nation is currently facing a final and critical juncture, more grave and perilous than the Mukden Incident.</p>
<p>In the September 18th Incident, the military leaders who bore direct responsibility could perhaps attribute it to the sudden outbreak and their initial miscalculation of the consequences. Although the people were concerned and filled with indignation, they were nonetheless constantly prepared to do their utmost to support the soldiers resisting the enemy. While the past is gone, we must ask how to deal with the current difficult situation and what preparations to make for the future calamity.</p>
<p>Based on our rational assessment, the military leaders in North China should now be aware of the gravity of the current situation and their responsibilities, as well as their own future prospects. At the same time, they should regret their past policy of non-resistance as a misjudgment. If they can have this awareness and remorse, and resolve to die for the Chinese nation, then the hundreds of thousands of brave men filled with grief and indignation, backed by the nation's fervent spirit, will make even the powerful neighbor不敢正眼相看不敢正眼相看不敢正眼相看think twice. Soon, the summer heat will subside, and autumn will bring tall horses and fat livestock. With hundreds of thousands of volunteer soldiers as the vanguard, advancing to conquer the puppet state and reclaim lost territory, the outcome may be uncertain, but it would be enough to uphold our righteousness and glorify our nation. At the same time, it would shift international attention. If they are aware but fail to act, if they are enlightened but continue to procrastinate and seek temporary comfort, the result will inevitably be further harm to the country, making them eternal sinners to our nation. Therefore, under this grave situation, the military leaders in North China should not only have a final awakening but also make the greatest determination to prepare practically for the final resistance.</p>
<p>However, North China belongs to the entire nation of China. The military leaders in North China, who bear direct responsibility, should make the final determination and prepare for the final resistance. The central government should especially coordinate the overall situation, defend against foreign aggression, and prepare to gather the full strength of our nation for a final struggle.</p>
<p>The situation is urgent! Let all levels of the country fulfill their respective responsibilities. Recently, the generals of North China gathered in Beiping, setting aside personal prejudices and sincerely plotting to defend the country. This awakening is truly beneficial to the life of our nation. We dare to repeatedly appeal to awaken our entire nation urgently.</p>

<p>(Beiping) On the evening of the 25th, the Volunteer Army outside Yuguan notified the Qianwei Railway Station, limiting them to three hours to surrender, otherwise they would take it by force. The puppet police at Qianwei Station refused and urgently telegraphed the Japanese garrison in Yuguan for assistance. After 7 o'clock, the Volunteer Army indeed occupied and burned down the Qianwei Station and took away Stationmaster Wu. Commander Wakakawa of the Japanese garrison stationed in Yuguan urgently dispatched a hundred or so soldiers and a locomotive to encircle and attack that night. On the 26th, the Volunteer Army retreated to the Huangdi Station, taking Stationmaster Wang with them. The puppet Fengshan Railway train that was supposed to arrive in Yuguan on the 27th was delayed by twenty-one hours. Passenger trains between Jinzhou and Yuguan have been suspended.

<p>(Beiping) A certain important person said that tonight the leaders from various provinces will hold a meeting of military and political research at Prince Shuncheng's Mansion.

The bandits in Sui have been largely suppressed. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Various circles of Chinese people are paying close attention to the discussions at tonight's meeting of military and political leaders held at Zhang Xueliang's residence. The situation is being kept strictly confidential, but it is widely believed that it concerns the plan for North China to defend against Japanese invasion. Tonight's meeting is actually more important than tomorrow morning's political affairs meeting, as it is expected that tomorrow morning's meeting will only be a formality. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying will arrive in Beiping tomorrow morning. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuju said, "I am a soldier and only know how to support the government, maintain local order, and do my best to defend against foreign aggression. Once all the matters discussed are completed, I will return to Jinan in about thirty days." (28th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Beiping Post Office Arranges Placement for Postal Workers from Outside the Pass <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Puppet Police Surround Post Office</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Movements Closely Monitored</p>
<p>(Beiping) Twelve postal workers from Northeast China have come to Beiping, and the Beiping Post Office is finding ways to place them. Postal workers in various counties in Northeast China, except for some who are being monitored by the Japanese, have all resigned and entered the pass. The postmaster of Hailong County is being monitored. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Shenyang Postal Administration was surrounded by puppet police on the 24th, announcing that all postal workers were not allowed to leave their posts without permission. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Shenyang News, the Northeast Volunteer Army and Self-Defense Army are extremely angry about Japan's encroachment on postal rights, and have issued orders to people that anyone holding counterfeit stamps or working in counterfeit postal agencies will be executed. Counterfeit mail can only pass through the railways, and in other areas where the Volunteer Army appears and disappears unpredictably, the lives of postmen are difficult to protect. It is also difficult for counterfeit post offices to recruit employees. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) The Liaoning Provincial Postal Administration was taken over and opened on the 26th by officials of the Communications Bureau of the Kwantung Office of the puppet state, selling counterfeit Manchurian state stamps. It is scheduled to take over the branch offices today and announce the recruitment of postal assistants. The puppet state requested that Balichi succeed in managing the Manchurian postal service, but Balichi politely declined. Balichi is an Italian and recently serves as the acting Italian consul in Shenyang, and cannot temporarily leave Shenyang to go east. Due to strict Japanese monitoring of postal workers' movements, they will not be able to enter the Pass enthusiastically, but there are still many people who risk leaving the country, traveling from Yingkou, Andong, Dalian, and Yuguan to serve in Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Qingdao, depending on the convenience of their route. Yesterday, employees of the Jinzhou Bureau were detained by the Japanese military police for leaving Jinzhou. The bureau opened today. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Another two groups of postal workers from outside the Pass arrived in Tianjin on the 28th, totaling thirty-four people, who were still accommodated and fed by the Tianjin Postal Workers' Union. (28th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After learning that Japan sealed off postal services in Northeast China, and that for counterfeit state mail sent to various countries, Japan is instead posting Japanese stamps. This is clearly an illegal act that damages the integrity of China's administrative sovereignty, and the Japanese military has recently been arresting postal workers retreating into the Pass midway. This is an insult to China's administrative affairs personnel. It is intended that a serious protest be lodged with Japan after formal confirmation is obtained, and at the same time, it will be brought to the League of Nations for sanctions under international law. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e13">Japan Sends Ambassador to Manchuria, Our Country Decides to Protest <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>

<p>(Nanjing) The draft conscription system has been reviewed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and sent to the Secretariat of the Central Political Committee. The content of the plan is based on the conscription systems of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Switzerland, and is divided into two items: national military service and regular military service. The method of national military service is to provide all draft-age men in the country, whether farmers, industrialists, businessmen, or students, with the prescribed military training during peacetime. In times of war, all citizens can be conscripted to join the army. The method of regular military service is that draft-age men across the country who volunteer to serve as regular soldiers, after passing the examination, can be enlisted and serve in the military, divided into three periods: active duty, reserve duty, and standby duty. In peacetime, they each focus on their respective occupations, and in wartime, they wait for conscription and dispatch. The existing army will be organized by region, with a division forming a division area and a regiment forming a regimental area, with no further subdivisions below that. (28th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Department of Construction received a telegram from the Southern Grand Canal Affairs Bureau on the 28th reporting that the river is flooding.

<p>Stimson Reiterates That the U.S. Far East Policy Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>(Guomin News Agency, Washington, 27th) Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, is passing through the United States on his way to take office. He is preparing to take a ship to Britain from New York tomorrow. Today, Guo continued to visit important figures in the American political world and old friends. He attended a luncheon hosted by U.S. Secretary of State Stimson yesterday. It is reported that Stimson personally assured Guo yesterday that the United States' position on the Far East issue firmly adheres to the principles stated in previous declarations and has not changed in the slightest. Guo told the American press here that if the Northeast issue cannot be resolved on the basis of international justice, China will continue to resist Japanese aggression by force. China's resistance to Japanese military aggression is not only for self-defense but also to maintain the dignity of the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. He also said that the current chaos in the three northeastern provinces is entirely due to Japan's invasion of Manchuria. It is gratifying that British and American people are increasingly understanding the situation in the Far East, and their influence on the Far East is also growing. He also stated that China is prepared to negotiate an honorable agreement using peaceful methods.</p>

<p>Consulates Arbitrarily Established in Jinzhou</p>
<p>(Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 28th) The Japanese government, without the consent of the Chinese government, arbitrarily established a consulate in Jinzhou, appointing Nakane as acting consul, and upgraded the Changchun consulate to a consulate general. All of these actions violate treaties between China and Japan. The Japanese government seems to view all international treaties as waste paper.</p>
<p>The Pseudo-State's "Emperor Emeritus" Flies to Tokyo</p>
<p>Disputes Arise Again Over the Successor</p>
<p>(Hualian News Agency, Changchun, 28th) The Director-General of the General Affairs Office of the Manchurian pseudo-state, Komai Tokuzo, took a plane from Changchun via Korea to return to Japan at 9:30 this morning. He is expected to arrive in Tokyo tomorrow. It is said that Komai will resign after arriving in Tokyo. According to Komai, this return to Japan is to request the government to recognize the pseudo-state as soon as possible and to discuss the liaison methods after the unification of the four-headed political system.</p>
<p>(Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 28th) After Director Komai of the Manchurian pseudo-state arrived in Tokyo, he expressed his resignation. The reason is that the views of the military and civil officials are diametrically opposed. Komai's view is that the autonomy of the 30 million Chinese in Manchuria should be respected, but the military opposes it. Komai had no choice but to resign, and this issue of succession has sparked a dispute between the military and the cabinet. Prime Minister Saito intends to appoint Marquis Maruyama Tsurukichi as Komai's successor as the pseudo-state's "Emperor Emeritus," but upon hearing this, the military insisted that it firmly opposed any politician who embraces liberalism and opposes the military's policy of annexing Manchuria and Mongolia. The cabinet has now yielded, and Maruyama will likely not get the position of the new pseudo-state's "Emperor Emeritus." The military's candidates for successor include Arita (the former political director of Korea, the brother of the current minister to China, Ariyoshi), Matsumoto (a doctor of law and former director of the South Manchuria Railway), and Shirasu (the former governor of Hokkaido), from among whom the selection will be made.</p>

<p>The Minseito Party Slanders the Adachi Faction</p>
<p>Money Used to Buy Off Assemblymen</p>
<p>Extremely Despicable Behavior</p>
<p>(Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 28th) The Japanese Minseito Party held an emergency leadership meeting today to discuss ways to deal with the Adachi faction's State Policy Club. As a result, Secretary-General Oyama issued a statement in his name, saying that the Adachi faction is organizing a new party under the pretext of purging the political world, but how can it explain its recent purchase of Diet members with gold and silver? It has offered 5,000 yen to a certain Diet member to buy his electoral territory and promised to guarantee his election expenses in the future. Such behavior can be described as a poisonous insect defiling the political world. The source of its gold and silver is also highly suspicious. But no matter where it comes from, its behavior is extremely despicable and must be rejected to the end, etc. As for the source of the money mentioned in the statement, a certain figure in the Japanese political world said that the Minseito Party is implicitly referring to the military's funding.</p>

The iron will be transported by Japanese ships within the next few days. It is said that this scrap iron will be used to build bridges in Japan.</p>

<p>Cooperation Sought With Britain</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 27th) The Japan Association hosted a banquet tonight for the Japanese military attache and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Honma, and the Japanese writer Yukio Ozaki. Honma gave a speech on the spot, advocating understanding and cooperation between Europe and Japan, saying that the spirit of the old Anglo-Japanese alliance still exists today and is even stronger than before. The most critical period in Japanese history will coincide with the presentation of the Lytton Commission report. Japan has always been confident in the righteousness of its cause. Britain was the first to understand the importance of the Northeast issue to Japan and to recognize the legitimacy of the self-defense actions of the Japanese army in China. During difficult times, when Japan encountered the world's misunderstandings and hatred, Britain's sympathetic mediation was extremely beneficial to Japan and gave Japan encouragement. The most urgent period in Japanese history is now about to arrive because of the Northeast issue. The Japanese urgently hope to obtain European cooperation and understanding in their national crisis. Former Ambassador to Japan, Tilley, raised his glass to Ozaki, calling Ozaki an international politician.</p>
<h3 id="e69">German Defense Minister's Remarks on Rebuilding Armaments <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Officialdom Denies Outside Interpretations</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 27th) German Defense Minister Schleicher made a broadcast speech yesterday, including remarks such as "If neighboring countries do not agree to reduce armaments to the level of Germany, then Germany will build up its armaments to the level of neighboring countries." The outside world interpreted this remark as implying that Germany intends to expand its army regardless of the provisions of the treaty. Officialdom is now firmly denying this interpretation, saying that Schleicher's remark meant that the government will reorganize its existing military forces and encourage the nation's youth to prepare to defend the country, but not to receive military training. Warlike nationalists initially heard Schleicher's remarks and believed that the restoration of the German army was in sight, but now they are greatly disappointed after hearing the remarks of a certain official in the Ministry of Defense. The official said that Germany would not take any action unless Germany's request for equality for all countries in Geneva could not be realized. Therefore, the Defense Minister is unwilling to publish the details of any of his plans until after the final word has been spoken in Geneva.</p>

<p>Ideology Extinguished, Life is Worse Than Death</p>
<p>The Defendant Smiled Upon Hearing the Sentence</p>
<p>(Guomin News Agency, Paris, 27th) After the Paris Criminal Court completed the trial of the Russian offender Gorguloff, who assassinated French President Doumer, the jurors deliberated briefly and declared that there was no reason to show leniency to Gorguloff for the murder of President Doumer. The judge then sentenced him to death and execution on the guillotine. After the sentence was pronounced, Gorguloff was taken back to Santé Prison to await execution. Now his defense lawyer plans to appeal to the French Court of Cassation. If the original verdict is upheld, he will then request the President to grant special clemency. If it is still difficult to approve, then Gorguloff will ascend the guillotine before the end of August.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 27th) The trial of the Russian Gorguloff for the assassination of French President Doumer has clarified that the Russian is indeed guilty of intentional homicide. After half an hour of deliberation, the jurors decided to impose the death penalty by hanging. When the death sentence was announced in court, the defendant's expression did not change, and he responded with a smile. When Gorguloff's lawyer was defending him, Gorguloff roared and repeatedly interjected, "I demand that the court sentence me to death, because my idealism has been extinguished by the French government. With my ideology extinguished, life is worse than death!" Gorguloff's lawyer argued that Gorguloff was mentally deranged when he committed the crime, so the jurors should make a determination on this point in the verdict. Gorguloff's wife also came to the court to testify, speaking with tears in her eyes, and her condition was miserable. Gorguloff, seeing his wife, reached out his hand and called out, "Anna, do you forgive me?" Gorguloff's wife said in a low voice, "He was always gentle and considerate, but his attitude changed drastically before the crime."</p>

<p>(Guomin News Agency, Paris, 27th) Soviet Russian Ambassador to France Dovgalevsky visited French Prime Minister Herriot today and had a long talk. The diplomatic world attaches great importance to this move, as it comes shortly after the signing of the Polish-Russian non-aggression treaty. It is expected to be a prelude to the early conclusion of a similar treaty between France and Russia, because Poland may not have been able to sign this treaty without the consent of Paris. This is sufficient to indicate that France is not without the intention of concluding a non-aggression treaty.</p>

<p>International Goodwill Cannot Be Relied Upon</p>
<p>Only Reliance on Own Strength</p>
<p>Hitler Delivers an Ardent Speech</p>
<p>(Guomin, Berlin, 28th) With only two days left until the general election, the election competition among all parties and factions in the country has reached its final struggle. The streets of Berlin are now almost completely covered with flyers and billboards, and the three parties that are most active, namely the National Socialist, Communist, and Social Democratic parties, are all engaged in a battle of wits and courage, competing with each other. The activities of the Catholic Center Party are concentrated in the areas where Catholics have a majority. The outcome of the competition among the parties cannot yet be predicted. Although each newspaper has its own insightful comments, they should not be completely trusted. The only thing that can be said with certainty is that the small parties have been greatly oppressed by the large parties and are gradually on the verge of extinction. Furthermore, the Catholic Center Party can be expected to add to the number of seats in the parliament. As for the competition between the National Socialist Party and the Communist and Social Democratic parties, it is still unknown who will win.</p>
<p>(Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 28th) National Socialist Party leader Hitler delivered a speech at a mass rally at the Olympic Stadium in the suburbs of Berlin today, which was warmly welcomed. The Brownshirts were well-commanded and orderly. The vast stadium was filled with people several hours before the meeting. This shows the National Socialist Party's organizational spirit. When Hitler spoke, hundreds of Brownshirts guarded the perimeter of the podium. Hitler's speech was as激烈 as usual, attacking the defects of the political system, saying that it had often placed Germans in shackles in the past thirteen years. He also said that others often criticize the National Socialists for not tolerating other parties. He can respond to this accusation by saying that the purpose of the National Socialist movement is to eliminate the thirty or so parties that have divided the country in the past and made it impossible to have a clear and strong policy. Finally, he said that the National Socialist Party does not believe in international goodwill and does not believe that relief can be obtained through goodwill. He believes that Germany must rely on its own strength to save itself.</p>

<p>(National News Agency, Berlin, 27th) Following the naval training ship's disaster, which resulted in the loss of over sixty young officers, all public institutions and countless private homes flew their flags at half-mast today in mourning. Radio broadcasts were suspended for entertainment programs and dance music. The training ship's commander was thrown into the sea when the ship capsized and was thus rescued. Initial investigations reveal no dereliction of duty on the part of the crew. A sudden violent storm broke the ship's masts, causing it to capsize at sea. It sank within minutes. All crew members were trapped inside, unable to escape. The ship now lies at a depth of twenty meters, and recovery is expected soon.</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Kiel, 27th) Authorities have officially released details regarding the training ship "Niobe" disaster. It is believed that most of the sixty-nine missing were listening to lectures below deck, and likely sank with the ship, unable to escape. According to witnesses, the ship lost steerage and sank within two to four minutes.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e76">From Huining to Dunhua <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>A Dispatch from Yanji</p>
<p>1.  Huining and the Tumen River</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The Tumen River lies along the northern border of Korea. Across the river, Jilin Province in China can be seen. Along the riverbank is Huining, a major city in northern Korea. Traveling west from Huining, one reaches Tongguan Town, the starting point of the Tumen Western Line (i.e., the Jilin-Huining Line), which is 46 miles long. Traveling east from Huining, one reaches Unggi, the starting point of the Tumen Eastern Line, which is 86 miles long. These two lines are the only transport arteries between eastern Manchuria and northern Korea.</p>
<p>The Western Line is connected to the Tiantu Railway (starting from Tianbaoshan in Jilin, passing through Laotou Gou, Tongfosi, Longjing Village, and reaching Shangsanfeng on the Tumen River) via the international railway bridge at Shangsanfeng. Timber and grain from the Yanji area are transported to Huining via this line, then to Chongjin via the Hamgyong Line in Korea for export. It is a major economic artery for cross-border trade. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese, as if intoxicated, have flocked from mainland Japan to Manchuria. The clatter of wooden clogs echoes across the fields of Yanji. The business on this line has flourished even more. According to investigations, in May of this year, the total number of passengers entering and leaving the country via this line was over 83,000, nearly twice the 41,400 passengers in the same month last year.</p>
<p>On the northern bank of the Tumen River, the original Northeast Border Defense Army's border garrison was stationed, led by Wang Delin. However, after the Incident, Wang Delin led his troops to form a volunteer army, moving in and out of the mountains and forests, fighting the enemy. The former barracks by the riverbank are now deserted. Customs outposts and public security police stations have all been occupied by rebels. "The carved rails and jade stairs should still be there, but the rosy faces have changed." Looking at the present and recalling the past, one cannot help but feel saddened.</p>
<p>2.  Juzijie (Yanji)</p>
<p>Juzijie is the central location of what the Japanese call "Kando". It faces the Buhar River and is only four li north of Longjing Village. Juzijie has a population of 19,000, with Chinese being the most numerous, followed by Koreans. Before March of this year, there were only 250 Japanese. However, according to recent investigations, the number of Japanese has suddenly increased from 250 to 800. The speed of this immigration rate is alarming. Therefore, if our country does not make an immediate effort to recover lost territories, within a few years, the entire Northeast will be controlled by those wearing wooden clogs, creating an deeply entrenched force, trapping us in a situation where we cannot recover. Before the September 18th Incident, there was only one Japanese restaurant in the area. Recently, the number has increased to twelve. Coffee shops have increased from one to four. Hotels have increased from two to six. Grocery stores have increased from two stores to five. The speed of this expansion is astonishing.</p>
<p>According to a Japanese survey, the land price in the Laogoutou area near Juzijie was originally 1.5 hao per ping (one ping equals approximately 0.0053805 mu in our system). Since the entry of the Japanese army, the price per ping has skyrocketed from 1.5 hao to 4-5 yuan. It is also rumored that gold mines have been discovered in the Badaogou area of Juzijie. Recently, a huge coal mine was discovered on the banks of the Juya River. Over the past few days, the Japanese Consulate in Juzijie has been surveying the mineral veins. Once the report is released, Japanese investors will flock there like ducks. In the past, our country neglected its national wealth, leading to the current situation where we watch helplessly as our treasure overflows. Alas!</p>
<p>3.  Longjing Village and Dunhua</p>
<p>Longjing Village was opened as a trading port in the first year of Xuantong (1909 in the Japanese Meiji 42nd year). At that time, there were only 96 Korean households and 5 Chinese households in the small village. Recently, the population has increased to over 18,000, including 14,000 Korean farmers, 3,500 Chinese, and 1,400 Japanese. It is a newly emerging city.</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese stationed a garrison and an air squadron in the area. The Longjing Consulate also recruited Koreans to form a self-defense force to counter our volunteer army.</p>
<p>Recently, at the Longjing Village train station (Tiantu Railway), slogans such as "The Japanese army is here, the people are happy," "The Japanese army has come, Yanbian is resurrected," and "Building railways is a successful paradise" are posted all over the walls. Judging by the handwriting and the wording, it is obviously an attempt to fabricate public opinion in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Northwest of Longjing Village lies Dunhua. Dunhua is a highland area where the residents have strong anti-Japanese sentiments. Therefore, before June of last year, there were only nine Japanese households (18 people). However, by June of this year, the number had suddenly increased to 222 households (982 people), a forty-two-fold increase compared to before the Incident. The number of Koreans has also increased more than twenty-fold from only 24 households (106 people) before the Incident to 530 households (2,721 people) recently. Currently, the total population of Dunhua, including Chinese, is estimated to be around 30,000. The total area of Dunhua County is 375 square li, with only one-seventh of the area cultivated. Furthermore, near Dunhua, 14 or 15 li from the upper reaches of the Mudan River, there are three major coal seams. There are also tigers, leopards, monkeys, rabbits, and other animals. It is rumored that the Japanese are planning to develop the area using a "military reclamation" system. The Japanese have long coveted our Northeast. Now that they have finally achieved their great desire, it is no wonder they are devouring it greedily, eager to swallow it whole.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese, using the pretext of Ishimoto's disappearance, have been encroaching on Rehe, it has once again attracted worldwide attention. Our country has long been aware of Japan's aggressive ambitions and is determined to defend with all its might. According to the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo (other newspapers also have similar reports), after the central government telegraphed Zhang Xueliang to lead his troops to resist the Japanese invasion, Zhang Xueliang actively prepared for military action. The following are the units of the Northeast Army that have recently moved towards the Rehe provincial border: (1) the 6th Artillery Brigade from NanKou and GubeiKou near Beiping, (2) the 4th Cavalry Brigade from Yutian, (3) the 7th Infantry Brigade from Shixia Town and Shunyi, (4) the 29th Infantry Brigade from Miyun, and (5) the 10th Infantry Brigade from Zunhua. Japanese newspapers have also published detailed surveys and maps of the Chinese troops stationed in Rehe Province, which shows the Japanese's intentions. A reproduced version is shown below.</p>

<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that the British military attaché in Beiping, Teidell, arrived in Jinzhou on the 21st and visited the Japanese military headquarters on the 22nd, where he met with Chief of Staff Kobayashi and raised four questions: (1) Will the Ishimoto case become the second Nakamura Incident? (2) Does the Japanese army intend to invade Rehe? (3) Zhang Xueliang has already prepared defenses in Rehe. What is the strength of the Japanese army in Jinzhou? (4) Where is the border of Manchuria? Kobayashi's answers are not detailed.</p>

<p>Painful words from an elderly former official after visiting Puyi</p>
<p>Puyi's tone was extremely unnatural during the meeting.</p>
<p>A correspondent from Hailar reports that a former elderly official was recently summoned by Puyi to Changchun to pay his respects to the so-called puppet state's head of state. Before his departure, he was overjoyed. However, upon his return yesterday, those who saw him found him constantly frowning and sighing. When asked about the reason, he sighed for a long time and spoke about the current situation of the puppet state of Changchun as follows (the following is the elderly former official's account): "I was a second-rank official in the late Qing Dynasty. After the revolution, I retired to business, valuing my reputation of indifference to fame and fortune. I settled in the Northeast, and have always been divorced from politics. During Zhang Zuolin's time, although he remembered his favor toward me, and repeatedly and firmly invited me to take on certain positions, I always refused. This time, with the creation of the Manchurian State, although I had no desire to pursue power, I was swayed by rumors. I had heard the Qing dynasty was being restored, so I repeatedly received letters from old friends in Changchun inviting me to build the country. I could not help but be moved. Recently, I received a handwritten edict from the Xuantong Emperor summoning me, so I decided to go and pay my respects, in order to view the reconstructed Manchurian homeland. After arriving in Changchun, what shocked me was that there were Japanese everywhere, and there was no government office without Japanese. Even at the gate of important government offices, there were Japanese and Koreans inside, interrogating visiting guests repeatedly, like customs officials checking for contraband. Furthermore, they showed no politeness. The guests stood while they sat, like prisoners being interrogated. The procedure to see the Xuantong Emperor was even more complicated. His residence was in the former Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office. Inside and outside the gate, besides the guards, there were plainclothes Japanese military police. Ordinary people are never allowed to see the head of state, and are instead seen by the Chief Secretary Komai. These were not orders issued by the head of state, but were completely deceived by the Japanese in order to control the emperor and command the feudal lords. Because I was summoned, I was spared Komai's substitute meeting. However, I first had to register at the Personnel Department, stating my resume and what I wanted to discuss. I filled it out clearly, and then the Personnel Department submitted it to the advisor, who signed and approved it. I was not allowed to see him that day, but was ordered to go the next morning at ten o'clock. I still went to the Personnel Department, and they led me to the head of state's office. At that time, the Xuantong Emperor was standing in the room, accompanied by two Japanese and two Japanese military officers. After I saluted, the Xuantong Emperor only said, 'It is good that you have come. The country is currently lacking people. You can go and meet Premier Zheng and Chief Secretary Komai, and submit your resume to the Personnel Department for review. If there are no problems, you can be appointed to a position.' When he spoke, his tone was extremely unnatural, and every time he said a word, he looked to the two Japanese on his left and right, as if he did not dare to fully express his thoughts. I said that I was currently engaged in business, and I was old and decaying, and I would not dare to take on heavy responsibilities again, and would not lead the country astray. Furthermore, the current agencies in various places are unable to handle affairs, and I am afraid that I would be difficult to manage. When I said this, the Xuantong Emperor's face changed suddenly, and he gestured with his eyes, not wanting me to say any more. At this point, the two Japanese companions seemed to resent me for not speaking correctly. They told Xuantong that the time was too long and asked him to dismiss me. Thus, without waiting for Xuantong to speak, they urged me to leave. When I left the room, I looked at the Emperor, my eyes filled with tears. I looked hesitant. At that moment, I felt a pang of sadness, and tears almost welled up in my eyes. I quickly bowed my head and hurried out. When I returned to the outer room and the Personnel Department, the Japanese head of the department came out to see me, and said with a stern face, 'The head of state summoned you to come because he intended to entrust you with relief work. Now, after an investigation by this department, it has been found that you embezzled funds when you were in charge of charity, so you cannot be appointed. How many days do you plan to stay here? If there is nothing to do, you can leave quickly.' I did not answer, but hurriedly left the room. That night, I packed my bags and returned in a hurry. I could not close my eyes on the car. Every time I closed my eyes, the Xuantong Emperor's sad face appeared before me. People say that the Manchurian State is a puppet government. I did not believe it at first, but after witnessing it once, I believed the rumors. I am afraid that the Xuantong Emperor is not even as good as a puppet, but just another Zhang Bangchang and Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong of Song! I also heard people say that Japan will unify the four-headed political system and send Mutō as a general to supervise the Northeast. Currently, Komai is ordering the head of state to write an encouragement to urge Mutō to come quickly. The Japanese officials in Changchun, even those in the lower positions of bureau and department heads, surpass the actual heads. Matters large and small are all handled by Komai, Ōhashi Tadashi (Deputy Foreign Minister), Sakatani (Deputy Finance Minister), Nakano (Director of the Internal Affairs Department), Katakura (Staff Colonel of the Military Administration Department), and others. Premier Zheng Xiaoxu is like a gourd tied but uneaten. The rest are even worse, and no one pays them any attention. Recently, there is a so-called advanced official training school in Changchun, with the head of state as the president. Officials above the section chief level from various government agencies are required to attend. Every day, Japanese and traitors give lectures on: (1) the politics of Wangdao (the Kingly Way), lectured by Zheng Xiaoxu; (2) general national policies, lectured by Director Komai; (3) finance, lectured by Deputy Director Sakatani; (4) law, lectured by Director Abiru; (5) diplomacy, lectured by Deputy Director Ōhashi; (6) internal administration, lectured by Director Nakano; (7) national defense, lectured by Staff Officer Nikura; (8) health, lectured by Professor Miura of the Medical University; (9) the cultural history of Manchuria, lectured by Eto, the director of the Fengtian Library. Although the Japanese use people without integrity as puppets, they cannot trust them for long. If there is any hidden complaint, they will think of using decisive means of punishment. Zhao Xinbo and Yuan Jinkai are both in Changchun. One is nominally the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, but where do the laws come from? They are all promulgated by the Japanese Kwantung Army, using his name to issue announcements. The other is a councilor, but he is not allowed to participate in any deliberations. These two have also lost their freedom. Recently, Yu Shencheng, who is in charge of military administration and suppressing bandits, and Bao Guancheng, the puppet mayor of Harbin, have been dismissed due to mutual accusations that made the Japanese suspicious. Those who become officials in the Manchurian State are gradually realizing the lesson that 'when the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked.' Therefore, they are all negative, thinking of ways to redeem themselves. Even Xi Qia and Yu Shencheng are the same. When these people turn against the Japanese, it depends on whether the central government gives them a chance to reform themselves. When I left Changchun, someone sent me to the station and firmly begged me to find a way to clear their name, so that they could be reborn. This shows the general mentality." (July 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Li Siguang Talks About Reorganizing National Central University <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing dispatch: Li Siguang told reporters, "My appointment to the Reorganization Committee of National Central University was forced upon me by the circumstances and was an unavoidable and temporary task. The outside world often mistakenly believes that I am the acting president, but this misunderstands the intention of the Executive Yuan's resolution. Although I have made this clear before, misunderstandings persist, so I must reiterate it. Since President Duan resigned, National Central University has been without a president, so the Reorganization Committee had to temporarily take over the president's responsibilities. However, the Reorganization Committee cannot reside in National Central University to handle school affairs, so the Executive Yuan appointed one member of the Reorganization Committee, after consulting with the committee, to act as president. This is an expedient measure and should not be prolonged. Professors are the ultimate masters of a university, and their fate should be in their own hands. Unfortunately, National Central University experienced an extraordinary accident. The masters were unable to resolve the crisis before it occurred. After it erupted, they were not allowed to participate in the aftermath, which is deeply regrettable. In the future, we should strive to remedy the situation, quickly conclude the reorganization work, and restore the school's regular organization to a healthy state, allowing it to resolve all its own problems. Everything at National Central University has come to a standstill, and there is much to be done. For a time, I felt overwhelmed. I now only hope that everyone will be patient and try to complete all pending matters within half a month. To get to the root of the problem requires the government's sincerity and the professors' determination. This time, the Reorganization Committee of National Central University has decided to allocate 50% of the funds for equipment. I strongly agree with this principle, but how to allocate the funds in detail requires further discussion. Monthly reports of actual income and expenses must be created as permanent records and discussion materials. Universities are institutions for exploring academic knowledge and should not be disturbed in the slightest, lest it disrupt thinking. In recent years, domestic and international political disputes have invisibly affected schools, or even originated in schools. Society only knows to condemn its evils, but does not understand its underlying causes. When politics is not on track, schools become unstable. When schools are in turmoil, it directly or indirectly makes it more difficult for politics to get on track. In my opinion, schools are not suitable places for actual political movements. Forcing it will ultimately lead to self-destruction. As for academic factionalism, it is entirely based on different academic viewpoints. If it is combined with superficial interests and affiliations, then it is not worth mentioning. I am not very familiar with the situation at National Central University, but I believe that the difficulties at National Central University may not lie here. If we consider all universities in the country, some are indeed suffering from this problem. The only solution is for everyone to devote all their efforts to academic pursuits. Then these disputes will resolve themselves. National Central University already has several kinds of research publications, which show this spirit. In the future, we should expand this to fill the entire school with academic air, so that those who occupy the name of the highest institution of learning in the central government, will truly be the highest institution of learning."

<h3 id="e80">Wind and Rain Cause Disaster in Boshan County, Shandong Province <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The light railway is mostly destroyed.</p>
<p>Many people drowned.</p>
<p>Jinan dispatch: Since the beginning of summer, there has been continuous rain in this province. The rain on the 25th was the heaviest. According to a telegram from Boshan County, there was a wild wind and heavy rain that night, and mountain floods broke out. The area near the train station became a swamp. The 12-li light railway from Boshan Station to the coal mine was mostly destroyed by the floodwaters. Many steel rails were also washed away. Countless houses collapsed, and electric poles fell to the ground. Because it was at night, residents who did not have time to escape were drowned. The river in Yuhang Street and the hygienic pool bathing pool outside the West Weimen gate, which is usually less than half a foot deep, is now a vast expanse of water. There are many floating corpses in the river. By the morning of the 26th, the water gradually receded, but the light railway was cut off, and coal transportation was completely blocked. Repairs will take time, and the losses are still being investigated. Last night, a large number of refugees from Boshan came to Jinan on the third Jiaoji train. They said that their fields and houses had all been washed away. The Liushan Street area, which is a recreation ground, was the site of a performance by the Qunying Society from Beiping. That night, just as the music was in full swing, the mountain flood suddenly came. The audience did not have time to escape and were mostly washed away by the water. The cries and wails shook the area for several li. It was unbearable to hear. The Jiaoji Railway's electric light room was fortunate to have a tall surrounding wall, otherwise it would also have been washed away. It is said that the mountain flood was caused by heavy rain in the Laiwu area, and the mountain flood flowed north along the river, causing this tragedy. (July 27th)</p>

<p>Request to Open Alleys to Facilitate Firefighting: Since the Da Feng store carelessly caused a fire at the beginning of the month, which spread to neighboring businesses, including Tang Sanju Shoe Store, Tang Zhimin, the owner of Tang Sanju store, recognizing that West Outer Street is a prosperous commercial area with narrow alleys, making it difficult for two people to pass while carrying water for firefighting, deemed it a shortcoming. At the second meeting of the County Chamber of Commerce, Tang Zhimin, as a member, submitted a written proposal, suggesting that in order to improve firefighting efficiency, the owner of Da Feng store should open a public alley during the reconstruction of the original building to facilitate firefighting. He also submitted a request to the County Government for approval. County Magistrate Shen has now submitted the case to the County Administration Meeting for discussion and resolution, instructing the County Chamber of Commerce to inform the owner of Da Feng store to comply. It remains to be seen whether the property owner will comply with the order to open an alley.</p>

<p>Agricultural School Student Drowns While Bathing: Lu Yilian, a second-year student at Taicang County Rural Normal School, went to bathe in the nearby river alone after submitting his exam papers the other day. Due to a moment of carelessness, he slipped and fell into the water. By the time people noticed and tried to find him, he had already drowned. The school authorities notified the student's family to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<p>Changzhou-Wuxi Gangs of Wheat Boats Brawls: The main agricultural product of this county in spring is wheat, and the annual export volume is very large. It is transported and sold to other ports by boatmen from Changzhou and Wuxi gangs. The other day, more than ten wheat boats from Changzhou and Wuxi gangs arrived at Zhintang Town under the county's jurisdiction to load goods and dock at the east and west ends of the town. For some unknown reason, the crew members of both sides had a quarrel, which escalated into a brawl with weapons. Many were injured in the melee. The villagers rushed to report to the Water Police Squad. Captain Yin Gengcai immediately led a team of police officers to suppress the violence, disarmed both sides, and arrested two ringleaders to be taken to the squad for interrogation.</p>

<p>Measures to Relieve Farmers: Wuxi has always been famous for its silk production, but in recent years, there have been consecutive crop failures. This year, it is even worse after last year's flood, causing the rural economy to collapse completely, with a significant impact on society. He Yushu, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Industry, recognizing this, has repeatedly come to Wuxi to invite local figures, together with County Magistrate Chen, to discuss countermeasures and jointly seek relief measures. He has also dispatched Inspector Hua Yinchun to be stationed in Wuxi permanently to liaise with all parties and discuss plans. Ding Songlin, Director of the Agricultural Improvement Station, has also drafted a complete plan to revitalize the rural economy using agricultural funds, starting with the current autumn silkworm season. Forty silkworm rearing guidance centers will be set up throughout the county. After careful consultation with Gu Shuzhi, Director of the Farmers Bank, it has been decided to proceed with the plan. Assistance has also been obtained from major silk factories such as Dingchang, Huaxin, and Ganshen, which will set up branches in various villages, and the progress is very smooth. Regarding the improvement of various agricultural aspects, Director He Yushu has also agreed that the funds will be set at 5,000 yuan. It is planned to use 2,514 yuan from the agricultural funds and 2,486 yuan from the remaining funds of 6,142 yuan for various agricultural expenses in Xiyi in the 20th year, making a total of 5,000 yuan. The plan has been submitted to the county government and forwarded to the department for record. In order to carry out the plan precisely, a silkworm rearing guidance discussion meeting was held yesterday at the County Girls' Middle School in Xiaolou Lane. Representatives from the Department of Industry Zhou Juesheng, silkworm experts Zou Jingheng and Zheng Haiquan, and Gu Shuzhi from the Farmers Bank jointly conducted detailed discussions.</p>
<p>Rogue Murders Someone: Liu Zhenhan, a local rogue from Panzhuang Village, Chongren Township, the 17th District (Fuan Township) of Wuxi, recently had a feud with Bao Sheng, the son of widow Liu Gong of the same village. On May 30th, he lured Bao Sheng to his home to stay overnight. He also sent three others, posing as members of the Zhouqiao Security Corps, armed with weapons, to surround Liu Zhenhan's house at night. They pretended that Bao Sheng was suspected of theft, arrested him, ordered a farm worker to tie his hands behind his back, dragged him to a deserted field outside the door, strangled him to death with a rope, and then hired a boat from a Zhu to transport the body to Dongshanzhu at the mouth of Taihu Lake and bury it, hoping to cover up the crime. However, since her son went missing, Liu Gong has been searching everywhere without any trace. Only recently did Liu Bingcheng, a citizen of the township, find out the truth. He came to the city with Gong the other day and secretly reported to the Public Security Bureau, requesting an arrest. Director Hua immediately dispatched Detective Dai Shouquan, leading the entire team of detectives, to the countryside overnight. They successively arrested the murderers Liu Zhenhan, Xie Yucen, Xie Qiaogen, and Xie Weiqing. Several others had already fled upon hearing the news. Detective Dai escorted the four criminals to the city and handed them over to the Public Security Bureau to await transfer to the court for investigation.</p>

<p>Measures to Punish Profiteers: The case of Cai Zhengxiang, a profiteer in Xiashi, privately selling Japanese yarn and inciting a crowd to rob goods has been reported in various newspapers in Shanghai and Hangzhou. It is now learned that the Provincial Party Headquarters, after receiving the report, considered the circumstances serious and specially dispatched Guan Xiaoxian to Xiashi to jointly investigate the truth with Zhan Yongquan and Yu Yunzhai, members of the Haiyan County Party Headquarters. After completing the investigation, they participated in the 20th standing committee meeting of the Xiashi Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. It was decided that the evidence of Cai Zhengxiang's private sale of Japanese yarn was confirmed and that, in accordance with Article 2 of the Zhejiang Province Temporary Rules for Punishing Profiteers Who Privately Transport and Sell Japanese Goods, the original goods should be confiscated and a fine of more than twice the value of the goods (totaling 2,000 yuan) should be imposed. For obstructing the inspection and gathering a crowd to disrupt the anti-Japanese national salvation work, it should be handled in accordance with Article 3. Both of the above items are limited to being presented to the meeting before July 28th to await punishment. If he fails to arrive within the time limit, a reward will be posted in the newspaper for his arrest and execution. After the resolution was made, Cai Zhengxiang was immediately notified, and a letter was sent to the Xiashi Public Security Bureau requesting assistance. Meanwhile, personnel were assigned to compile a special publication to fully disclose all aspects of the case, so that the public could understand the truth of the case and be warned.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Minister Song Arrives in Shanghai Again Yesterday <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Northeast Customs and Abolition of Tael and Adoption of Dollar Issues: According to the Central News Agency, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen was originally scheduled to fly from Nanjing to Wuhan yesterday morning to report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the progress of negotiations in Shanghai regarding the abolition of the tael and adoption of the dollar and other financial issues. However, due to the Northeast Customs blockade issue, which has been approved by the Central Political Conference and urgently needs to be implemented, Song flew from Nanjing to Shanghai at 6:00 AM yesterday morning on the Sikorsky aircraft, arriving in Shanghai at approximately 8:00 AM. He went directly to his private residence on Qiqi Road. Feeling slightly unwell, he immediately called upon British doctor McKinley for treatment.</p>
<p>Accompanying Personnel: The Sikorsky aircraft that Song used to come to Shanghai was piloted by two American aviation instructors. Those who came with Song included Yang Ge, Western advisor to the Ministry of Finance, Secretary Huang Chundao, and five others. Song took off from Nanjing at 6:00 AM yesterday morning and arrived at Longhua Airport at approximately 8:00 AM. Song's guards were waiting at the airport. Since Song's visit to Shanghai was not notified in advance, very few people outside knew about it.</p>
<p>Song Feels Slightly Unwell: Song felt slightly unwell due to catching a cold during the flight. At 3:30 PM, he invited British doctor McKinley from No. 41 Albert Road for treatment. According to Dr. McKinley, after examining Song's illness, he told the Central News Agency reporter that Song's illness was due to catching a cold during the journey and was not serious. He would recover within a day or two.</p>
<p>Refuses to See Guests: After returning to his residence, Song, feeling unwell, immediately informed his family to refuse to see guests. Therefore, Zhu Tingqi, Director of the Salt Affairs Administration, and others visited one after another but were not received. However, Tang Hai'an, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, was summoned by Song at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon and did not leave until 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>Mission in Shanghai: According to the Central News Agency reporter's investigation of Song's mission in Shanghai: (1) The Northeast Customs blockade issue has been approved by the Central Political Conference and urgently needs to be implemented. Therefore, he came to Shanghai to consult with various circles in Shanghai to discuss ways to implement the blockade. (2) Regarding the abolition of the tael and adoption of the dollar issue, the first meeting of the Abolition of Tael and Adoption of the Dollar Research Committee the other day had achieved considerable results. Therefore, Song also needs to consult with the financial circles in Shanghai again. Therefore, he temporarily suspended his trip to Wuhan and came to Shanghai. After completing his official duties in Shanghai, he will return to Nanjing and then go to Wuhan.</p>

<p>Official Announcement Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday issued Bureau Order No. 1606, stipulating the handling of mail from the three northeastern provinces: In order to inform you, regarding the suspension of all postal services in the three northeastern provinces, as notified in Bureau Order No. 1602, now, according to the telegram from the Postal Administration, the following measures should be taken for mail to and from the three northeastern provinces. It is hereby ordered that all of you should comply with this order. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Incoming Mail: (1) All incoming mail originating from the three northeastern provinces (except the South Manchurian Railway area) and transferred from Dalian or other places, bearing (a) counterfeit Manchurian postal stamps, (b) Japanese ordinary postal stamps, (c) Republic of China postal stamps canceled with the first year date stamp, will be regarded as not having paid postage. The mail will be collected with postage due. (2) All mail bearing uncanceled Republic of China postal stamps, or if the mail indeed originates from the Kwantung Leased Territory and bears Japanese postal stamps, will be regarded as having paid sufficient postage as usual. (3) All mail originating from the South Manchurian Railway area (except the Kwantung Leased Territory) bearing Japanese ordinary postal stamps will be regarded as having insufficient postage.

<h3 id="e93">Methods for Sending Mail to Europe <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Choose Ships Carefully: According to postal authorities, mail to European countries may be delivered via Canada, the United States, or the Suez Canal, unless further notice. The ships used for transport are carefully selected for their fastest sailing speed. The schedule for sealing and sending mail to European countries before August 8th is as follows:</p>
<p>Ship Name Sealing Date and Time Departure Date Estimated Arrival Date in London Number of Days Required</p>
<p>Empress of Canada July 31st, 11:00 PM August 1st August 28th 27 days</p>
<p>Conte Rosso August 5th, 8:00 AM August 5th August 30th 25 days</p>
<p>President Cleveland August 8th, 9:00 PM August 9th September 4th 26 days</p>
<p>Utilizing Aviation: According to local postal authorities, China Post has always been actively utilizing airmail services from southern China to Europe. Since the opening of the Saigon-Marseilles airmail route last year, China Post has entered into necessary arrangements with Indochina Post to utilize this newly opened air route for mail delivery. Mail to various landing places along the route can also be delivered at the same time. The place names are as follows: Bangkok (Siam), Yangon (Myanmar), Kolkata (British India), Karachi (British India), Dizak (Persia), Bhojak (Persia), Baghdad (Iraq), Beirut (Syria), Rhodes (Asia Minor), Athens (Greece), Naples (Italy), Marseilles (France).</p>
<p>The Saigon-Marseilles airmail route operates once a week, with landing points as mentioned above. All senders can use this route to send mail to these places. This is because these mails can be transferred from Hong Kong to Haiphong to connect with the special express train from Haiphong/Hanoi to Saigon. For transfer details and airmail rates, please inquire at all post offices and ask for forms for review.</p>
<p>In addition, whether the airmail route from Bandung (Java) to Amsterdam can be utilized and whether it can be transferred via Singapore is currently under negotiation.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Japanese Obstruct Postal Workers from Entering Customs <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Residents Sent Mail Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Japan is actively undermining China's postal rights. After we implemented the blockade of postal services in the three northeastern provinces, the settlement of affairs in the three provinces is entirely handled by Ba Lidi, the postal director of Liaoning Province. The deputy postal director, Liu Yaoting, has already entered the customs and arrived in Shanghai to report to the General Administration about the various experiences and current situation of being seized. The information that the reporter inquired about from various parties yesterday is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Obstruct Entry into Customs: The reporter inquired from the local postal authorities yesterday and learned that after the eastern provinces were ordered to be blockaded, all remaining affairs have been settled. All personnel, those who wished to leave left, and those who did not wish to enter customs also closed their doors and ceased operations, to show non-interaction. However, some personnel wishing to enter customs, feeling that transportation was difficult and blocked and aware of the dangers along the way, first asked Post Director Ba to issue passports to the Japanese consulate in advance to return to China via Dalian. However, the Japanese side initially agreed, but then, seeing that we had implemented the blockade, deliberately delayed the issuance of passports, causing some postal workers to be stranded in the eastern provinces, unable to leave. Although Post Director Ba of Liaoning Province tried to negotiate, the other party remained calm. It seems that this will create obstacles again. Yesterday, the post office received a telegram from Liaoning Province, also reporting the situation of being obstructed by passports.</p>
<p>Remarks by Zhu Menghou: The reporter met with Zhu Menghou, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Postal Administration. According to him, since the blockade of postal services in the eastern provinces, not only are letters not sent to the northeast, but also all post offices in the eastern provinces are closed. This is a step that we are forced to take. As for the takeover by the puppet state, this is what they obtained by force, and it is not that we asked them to take over because we suspended operations. All personnel, after the blockade order was issued, regardless of rank, from the postal director down to the postman, were free to enter customs if they wished, otherwise they were free to leave. Because we implemented the blockade, the puppet state sent personnel to seize the property by force on the 24th. Some personnel, because they are registered in various provinces inside the customs, wanted to enter the customs and return home, but due to passport issues, they are still staying in Shenyang. Therefore, Post Director Ba of Liaoning Province telegraphed today to report to the General Administration about this.</p>
<p>Lin Shi May Arrive This Morning: The rumor that Lin Shi, Director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications, has arrived in Shanghai is not accurate. The reporter visited his residence yesterday and was told that Lin must take the overnight express train from Nanjing to Shanghai tonight (i.e., yesterday) and will arrive in port tomorrow morning (i.e., today). Not only will he consult with the puppet state's postal service, but also Lin must attend the Postal Economic Committee meeting on Friday (today).</p>
<p>Japanese Establish Postal Services in Tianjin and Qingdao: According to the Central News Agency, recent reports indicate that the Japanese have established counterfeit post offices in Tianjin and Qingdao and are sending mail, undermining China's postal system. The General Administration of Posts specially telegraphed the post offices in Tianjin and Qingdao yesterday morning to inquire in detail. If the reports are true, they will report to the Ministry of Communications and consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for serious negotiations. In addition, the property of the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Postal Districts, including real estate, totaling more than 2.9 million yuan, was seized by the rebels. Regarding the issue of postal remittances and savings in that area, according to Zhu Menghou, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Postal Administration, the rebels are naturally responsible for it.</p>
<p>Japanese Mail Sent to the Northeast Yesterday: The Japanese temporary post office at the Japan Club shipped a total of 169 bags of mail collected yesterday bound for Harbin and Siberia in the Northeast on the Dalian Maru. The mail was unloaded in Dalian. The ship passed Qingdao, and the Japanese in that port also received mail and sent it to the Northeast.</p>

<p>According to the Far East News Agency, after the Northeast and Dalian Customs were seized by the Japanese-incited puppet state, all Chinese officials in the customs, feeling the unfavorable environment and Japanese threats, secretly packed their bags and left the customs. The first batch of over twenty people, including Ke Nahua, Chen Minglan, Chen Gengping, Huang Wenjie, and their families, arrived in Shanghai by ship from Dalian yesterday. It is reported that a second batch will arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>

<p>The Fourth Avenue Business Association, the Citizens' Union, and the 20th District Branch, concerned about the Japanese troops invading Rehe, specially telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, urging him to send troops to aid Rehe. The telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>To General Zhang Xueliang, Pacification Director of Beiping:</p>
<p>The Japanese troops are invading Rehe, and Chaoyang is in imminent danger. We are deeply indignant upon hearing this news. We still remember that the loss of our three northeastern provinces was the result of the non-resistance policy. Today, the enemy is gaining an inch and seeking a foot, which is their usual tactic of aggression. They are invading our Rehe again. If Rehe is lost, then the postal routes to Pingjin will be in danger. If this continues, the day of national demise will not be far away. We deeply hope that the General will put the country first and personally lead a large army to provide support, dedicating himself to the battlefield to bring glory to the country and fulfill the responsibility of a general. In this way, the Japanese bandits can be annihilated, Rehe can be protected, and there is also hope of recovering the lost territory of the three provinces. Please make a decisive decision immediately and resolutely act, and do not repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>

<h3 id="e97">The Blood Soul Eradication Corps Bombs the Yongchang Coal Company with a Hand Grenade <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Business Partner Yu Ruiliang Injured</p>
<p>A group identifying themselves as the Blood Soul Eradication Corps previously placed hand grenades at the Cotton Fabric Industry Guild and the Gauze Exchange Broker Guild as warnings, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, an explosion occurred at the Yongchang Coal Company near Chihang Bridge.</p>
<p>Yongchang's Past</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports: Wu Jichang, the manager and owner of the Yongchang Hongji Coal Company at 729-731 Xin Zha Road, is considered a mid-sized enterprise in the coal industry, having been in operation for over twenty years. It employs twelve shop assistants and forty workers, and is a member of the Shanghai Coal Industry Guild. On January 19th of this year, the entire coal industry boycotted the patriotic movement due to the coal company's actions, colluding with the British firm, Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co., to falsely report to the police, leading to the arrest and investigation of Yan Bin. After a general meeting, a two-day strike was decided. Yan Bin was found not guilty by the court and released, and the company resumed operations. The Yongchang Coal Company was expelled from the guild and banned from operating in the market.</p>
<p>Bomb Explosion</p>
<p>At 7:45 AM yesterday, the coal company had already opened for business when a young man, about twenty years old, wearing a white short shirt and pants, was seen loitering in front of the shop carrying a paper package. He immediately unwrapped the package and forcefully threw it inside, then fled. A loud explosion occurred, and thick smoke filled the air. Shop assistant Yu Ruiliang, 27 years old, from Yuyao, Zhejiang, was immediately injured in the buttocks by the blast. Bleeding profusely, he collapsed in extreme pain. All the workers and shop assistants were terrified upon hearing the explosion.</p>
<p>Police Investigation</p>
<p>Manager Wu Jichang, who was upstairs at the time, heard the explosion and came downstairs. Upon seeing the situation, he immediately reported it to the Xin Zha Police Station by telephone. Six Chinese and foreign armed detectives were dispatched to investigate. They found that coal balls and wooden boards placed against the west wall of No. 731 had been blown into a hole. Three holes were found in the sunshade canvas. A bicycle was destroyed. A piece of fuse rope, about a foot long, was found and taken back to the police station for thorough investigation. The injured shop assistant Yu Ruiliang was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. As the injuries were minor, he was bandaged up and discharged immediately. However, at 4:00 PM, the bleeding from his buttocks had not stopped, and he was taken back to Renji Hospital by the shop owner for further treatment.</p>
<p>Eradication Corps Letter</p>
<p>The coal company received a letter yesterday stating: "Wu Jichang of the Yongchang Coal Company, be informed that this morning's small gift was a special reward for your meritorious service in selling Japanese coal. You may continue to sell more in the future. Our group will give you a generous reward. This is a warning from the Shanghai Blood Soul Eradication Corps, July 28th." It is also reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council received a letter from the group stating: "To Whom It May Concern, Our group is entirely organized by Chinese patriotic volunteers with strict discipline. Our sole purpose is to eliminate treacherous merchants who sell Japanese goods. We will not cause any harm to the peace of this city. Please do not interfere with our future actions. With regards, The Shanghai Blood Soul Eradication Corps." It is also reported that the Cotton Fabric Guild and the Gauze Exchange also received a letter from the group stating: "To the Standing Committee of the Cotton Fabric Guild, We trust that you have received and understood our letter and small gift yesterday. We hereby issue a serious warning. Please immediately notify your members within three days and publish a large advertisement on the front page of major newspapers in this city, stating your determination not to sell Japanese goods. Otherwise, our group will consider that your guild has no sincerity in resisting enemy goods and will take serious action against you. With the country in dire straits, we are prepared to die for this cause. From the Shanghai Blood Soul Eradication Corps." The letter received by the Gauze Exchange was similar.</p>
<p>Accountant's Explanation</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with the accountant of the coal company yesterday, who stated that the case involving the arrest of an investigator from Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. in January had absolutely nothing to do with the coal company. As for the guild's expulsion of the company, the matter has not yet been resolved. This time, it was definitely a misunderstanding that the coal company was a traitor.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Plummet in Price</p>
<p>After the Gauze Exchange Broker Guild and the Cotton Fabric Industry Guild received bomb warnings, the price of Chinese gauze in the Shanghai Gauze Exchange soared yesterday, while the price of Japanese gauze suddenly plummeted. Japanese cotton cloth in the cotton fabric market fell sharply, with few customers inquiring about it. The sales of domestic cotton cloth turned buoyant.</p>
<p>Cotton Industry Announcement</p>
<p>After receiving a warning from the Blood Soul Eradication Corps, the Cotton Fabric Industry Guild issued a special announcement yesterday stating: "For the matter of announcement, it was found that today (July 27th) at 11:30 AM, a young man in a Western suit delivered a letter and a tin can of biscuits to the guild and handed it to the tea server. The young man then turned and left. Upon opening it, it was discovered that the can contained a hand grenade, and the letter warned members not to traffic in enemy goods. We have reported this matter to the police and had the letter and hand grenade removed. We are now urgently copying the original letter and announcing it to the market, hoping that all members will pay close attention to avoid endangering themselves. This is what we earnestly hope. This announcement."</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Japanese Government Allocates Huge Sums to Revive Japanese Ships on the Yangtze River <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Japanese Goods Shipped Out Yesterday</p>
<p>Nisshin Steamship Company to Resume Regular Service</p>
<p>What Are the Thoughts of the Chinese People on This?</p>
<p>Japanese merchant ships on the Yangtze River have been suspended since the January 28th Incident, with only a few ships being leased to the Japanese Navy for transporting military supplies. After the Japanese troops withdrew, many Japanese bridges on the Yangtze River resumed operations. However, the Nisshin Steamship Company's riverboats have not yet officially sailed. Mr. Yoneri Monji, the president of the Nisshin Shanghai branch, went to Japan to discuss the plan to revive Yangtze River shipping with the head office and the Japanese government. The conclusion of the discussion was that, firstly, the anti-Japanese movement among the Chinese people must be fundamentally eliminated, and secondly, the government should allocate funds to support the company's resumption of shipping. It is now heard that the anti-Japanese issue has been raised by the Shanghai Japanese Residents' Affairs Committee, which has requested the Consul General in Shanghai to implement the conditions of the January 28th Agreement to stop anti-Japanese activities. Therefore, Japanese goods imported into Shanghai have begun to be shipped out in large quantities from yesterday. At the same time, with the government's financial assistance, the company's resumption of Yangtze River shipping will also be realized from August 1st. There will also be a plan to lower prices and reduce fares to compete with Chinese and foreign ships on the same route. The details of this matter are recorded below:</p>
<p>Dispatching Ships</p>
<p>The Nisshin Steamship Company originally had more than twenty ships on the Yangtze River route. All of them were suspended during the war. Later, the Daifuku Maru and others were leased to the Navy for transportation. Now, the company has recovered all the leased ships and temporarily assigned the Fengyang Maru, Xiangyang Maru, Nanyang Maru, and other ships to operate the Shanghai-Hankou regular service. The Xinyang Maru will operate between Yichang and Chongqing. The Luoyang Maru, Yueyang Maru, Ruiyang Maru, and other ships that have been suspended for a long time will be used to increase services when Japanese ships on the Yangtze River can transport Chinese goods and passengers. Currently, a few ships will be used for trial voyages. Japanese staff at various docks and branches along the Yangtze River, such as Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, and Yichang, who were evacuated during the war, have now been reassigned to their positions.</p>
<p>Loading Cargo</p>
<p>A large amount of Japanese goods has been accumulated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. In addition, many Japanese goods have recently been transported from the East to Shanghai and then to Hankou and other ports. Starting on the 27th, the Japanese, disregarding the boycott and refusal to transport goods in the interior, openly declared and transported a large number of Japanese piece goods, foreign paper, kelp, groceries, etc., stored in Shanghai. The Fengyang Maru of the Nisshin Steamship Company was used for transportation. All customs declaration procedures were handled by the Japanese themselves. The first batch of a large amount of Eastern goods, about 10,000 pieces, was bound for various ports on the Yangtze River and left Shanghai yesterday morning. This is the largest first batch of Japanese goods transported to Hankou after the war. The Navy has been ordered to protect the loading and unloading of goods along the way.</p>
<p>Financial Assistance</p>
<p>The Nisshin Steamship Company has been suspended since February 1st, exactly half a year. The company has suffered huge losses in business. According to the company, the monthly loss is at least 150,000 to 200,000 yuan. Now, the company is urgently seeking to resume operations. Mr. Yoneri Monji, the president of Nisshin Steamship Company, requested a large subsidy from the Japanese government as funds for the revival of Japanese ships on the Yangtze River. It is now confirmed that the Japanese Ministry of Communications has decided to allocate 1.2 million Japanese yen for the revival of Yangtze River shipping, as the Yangtze River shipping is crucial to the sales of Japanese goods. It is said that the funds have been issued, and Nisshin will use them to restore riverboat services.</p>
<p>Price Cuts</p>
<p>The Japanese also know that it will not be easy to restore the Yangtze River shipping to its pre-war state. Japanese merchants have been discussing the plan to restore Yangtze River shipping in recent days. It is heard that they have decided to exploit the Chinese merchants' weakness of greed for profit, collude with treacherous merchants to solicit passengers and cargo, and secretly reduce the fares to half of the price set by the six companies. For passengers, a reduction plan will be set. For example, the first-class fare from Shanghai to Hankou is 50 yuan, but the Japanese ships will only charge 25 yuan. Second and third-class tickets will also only be half price. Steerage passengers will be allowed to ride for free with limited restrictions, only collecting a small ticket fee. The price will be increased when business improves. This move by the Japanese will also severely hit Chinese merchant ships. It is said that the Japanese government will subsidize the operating losses during the restoration period.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Incense Workers Strike Yesterday <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Request for Improved Treatment Rejected</p>
<p>Labor Union Reports to Party and Government for Investigation</p>
<p>The Da Gong News Agency reports that more than 400 incense workers in this city suddenly went on strike yesterday due to repeated oppression from employers and difficult living conditions. The labor union has reported the situation to the Party and government agencies. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Labor Dispute</p>
<p>The wages of incense workers are very low, and the workers have great difficulty making a living. The labor union convened a representative assembly in August last year, and representatives were sent to negotiate with the employers, requesting improved treatment. The employers repeatedly refused. Later, the Shanghai War broke out, and the negotiations were suspended. After the ceasefire agreement was signed and the situation stabilized, the labor union again sent representatives to negotiate with the employers, but to no avail. The Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management representatives for questioning twice, but only the labor representatives attended, and no management representatives attended, resulting in a prolonged lack of resolution. Recently, the employers of various stores have successively fired more than 100 workers. Workers in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts had no choice but to go on strike voluntarily yesterday. After hearing the news, the labor union sent personnel to investigate everything and reported it to the Party and government agencies for investigation.</p>
<p>Demands</p>
<p>After the incense workers went on strike, they made four demands to the employers: (1) Employers shall not dismiss workers without reason. (2) Employers are required to pay the labor union 100 yuan per month for operating expenses. (3) Employers shall not use breaches of labor-management contracts as excuses. (4) Wages and various expenses shall be increased by 40% across the board.</p>
<p>Impact on the Concessions</p>
<p>After the incense workers' strike occurred, only workers in the Chinese-controlled areas inside and outside the city and in Zhabei participated in the strike yesterday morning. After hearing the news, workers in the concessions also joined the strike in the afternoon, and the situation is quite serious.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Wang Chongzhi Defends the Mackay Communications Contract <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Declares That He Has Always Opposed It and Did Not Participate</p>
<p>Requests That the Machine Purchase Contract and Attachments Be Announced</p>
<p>Chen Fumu, the Acting Director of the Ministry of Transportation, was attacked by outsiders regarding the communications contract signed between the Ministry of Transportation and the American Mackay Company. In his statement published in the newspapers, he implicated Li Fanyi, the former Director of the Department of Electrical Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, and Wang Chongzhi, the Director of the International Telegraph Bureau. Subsequently, Li and Wang resigned. Wang also sent a letter to Huang Shaoxiong, the Acting Minister of Transportation, and sent a special letter to Chen Fumu after his resignation to defend himself. The original letter is as follows: Mr. Fumu, With respect, I read your statement on the Mackay Communications Contract in various newspapers on July 17th. There are many points that do not conform to the facts and insult others. Due to my official position, I have remained silent to await a fair judgment from society. However, the Shen Bao published a letter from Mr. Zhenru to Mr. Jikuan on the 21st, saying that Wang Chongzhi violated discipline and should be punished. I am extremely confused and horrified. However, right and wrong can never be subdued by power, and interests can never be concealed by false words. Now that I have resigned, I would like to state the following to you:</p>
<p>Opposing the Contract</p>
<p>(1) I have always expressed my opposition to the Mackay Communications Contract. I first telegraphed you in mid-February, saying: "To Chen, Acting Director of the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing, I have received your secret telegram. I have investigated that there are many disputes over China's international radio communication loans, including the Sino-Japanese Shuangqiao Radio Station, the Sino-American United Contract, the Sino-British Northwest Three Stations, etc. All these contracts allow others to have exclusive rights. When the Ministry of Transportation and the Construction Committee planned to set up a large international radio station, they all purchased equipment with cash and operated it independently to avoid causing diplomatic problems. When the Zhenru Grand Radio Station officially reported, Japan protested that it infringed the interests of the Shuangqiao Radio Station. This is one point. The Ministry of Transportation and the Construction Committee previously signed communications contracts with the United States, Germany, France, and the Philippines. Now a certain American company is willing to invest in setting up a station for China, which is for the purpose of communications contracts. This point conflicts with the current Sino-American communications contract. This is the second point. The equipment prices of the International Grand Radio Station are not too high, and the revenue from reporting fees is huge. Domestic banks and the Postal Savings Bureau may also be willing to invest in purchasing equipment. This is the third point. My bureau has two powerful Fenbao 2-kilowatt transmitters that have not yet been installed. During Minister Wang's term, it was planned to increase the power to 20 kilowatts for global communication, with a budget of 300,000 yuan, which could build two large radio stations. This is the fourth point. However, this matter is very important. I have briefly stated one or two points based on my limited understanding. I respectfully ask for your instructions. Signed, Wang Chongzhi." Finally, on June 28th, upon hearing that the contract was about to be signed, I telegraphed Director Li to express my opposition, saying: "Urgent, To Director Li of the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing, Secret, I heard that the Mackay Communications Contract is about to be signed. This matter will be subject to arbitration in the future, and our side will inevitably lose. It will not only damage the country's reputation but also harm the Minister's reputation. Chinese electrical personnel are completely speculative. Why be fooled? I intend to telegram the Minister to ask him to reconsider. Sincerely, Zhi." It can be seen that those who supported the signing were others, and it was definitely not me.</p>
<p>Did Not Participate</p>
<p>(2) When the Sino-American communications contract and the machine purchase contract were signed, Mr. Sun Sheng, the assistant manager of the China Electric Company, was also present. After the two contracts were signed, Mr. Zhenru gave the Minister a copy of the China Electric Company's proposal for the Mackay Contract and wireless telephone. At the same time, Mr. Sun requested the Minister to give specific instructions. He did not say anything about signing. At that time, the Minister asked Director Li what his opinion was. Director Li said that Article 11 of the Joint Venture Company Communications Contract states that "Both parties are free to sign wireless radio communication contracts with other countries, but they shall not violate the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of this contract." "Other countries" seem to refer to countries other than the parties involved. If Mackay, an American company, signs another contract, it may be contradictory. He suggested that legal experts should review it to avoid repeating the mistake of losing the Czechoslovakian arbitration and harming the country's reputation. Regarding the telephones, he said that technical issues should be handed over to wireless electrical engineers for detailed review. The Minister said yes. These were the facts at the time. The section of the above-mentioned four contracts that you mentioned on the table is definitely not true, as anyone who has experienced it knows. As for the section where the Mackay Company supplemented the responsible guarantee letter, saying that I also praised it as extremely appropriate, national administration cannot be interfered with by a company, and national reputation cannot be guaranteed by a company. Anyone with common sense should know this. Although I am foolish, I have never expressed support for this kind of proposition.</p>
<p>Signed Hastily</p>
<p>(3) According to your statement, the Mackay Communications Contract and the Wireless Telephone Machine Purchase Contract were signed on June 27th. However, Director Li did not submit his resignation until the 29th, and the acting person during his sick leave was Zheng, the section chief of the first section of the Department of Electrical Administration. Therefore, the Department of Electrical Administration was never without a responsible person, and the exercise of power was never interrupted. May I ask why the two contracts were signed hastily without being submitted for detailed review beforehand, and without being countersigned afterwards? Also, why was the machine purchase contract not reviewed by the engineers in charge of the International Radio Station? Why was it purchased hastily and not announced? (4) On June 28th, Chen Hezong, the secretary, showed me a draft of the Mackay Communications Contract. (I only saw the original Communications Contract in the newspaper, and I never saw the Machine Purchase Contract). Although this is true, I immediately stated that I fundamentally disagreed with the contract. Even in terms of wording, there were inappropriate places. I pointed out several places and telegraphed Director Li to oppose it on the same day. I did not expect that it would be signed without going through the Department of Electrical Administration. As for your statement that the contract was "brought to the Ministry for sealing, and other than the two copies left in the Ministry, it was handed over to the company for safekeeping," there were no witnesses on the Ministry's side, so how could it be handed over to the company? And whether the sealing of the contract was on June 27th or on the morning of July 6th (the date of Director Li's handover), the rumors are different, and there is no way to know the details. Furthermore, the Mackay Contract (and its attachments, i.e., the guarantee letter) should be announced in full.</p>
<p>Collaboration with the Puppet State</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the American joint venture company's communication with the puppet state of Manchuria, I have repeatedly reported to the Ministry to ask for instructions on how to deal with it. At the same time, the Ministry also telegraphed Director Zhang of the Beiping office, who originally signed the Northeast-American communication contract, to negotiate with the company, and consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the American government. Recently, Section Chief Zheng has repeatedly urged Director Liu of the European and American Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle it quickly. Therefore, I cannot be solely responsible for the delay. Furthermore, I telegraphed the Ministry on April and June to ask for instructions on the negotiation policy, but I did not receive a reply. You were acting as Minister at that time, so you are actually responsible for the delay. Furthermore, we believe that the American company's communication with the puppet state of Manchuria violates the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of the Ministry's contract. The American company believes that it is continuing the old Northeast contract and is not violating the contract. According to Article 10 of the contract, any disagreement in the interpretation of the contract clauses should be submitted to arbitration. However, because the Northeast contract conflicts with the Ministry's current contract, and the Ministry has never denied it, and our country is also communicating with the three northeastern provinces, we may not necessarily win if we submit it to arbitration. Therefore, we first started with diplomacy. As an insider, how can you deny that you are unaware of the complicated situation in this matter? Is the termination of communication and the signing of the Mackay Contract in violation of the original contract? Is it deliberately causing disputes?</p>
<p>Unfair Machine Purchase</p>
<p>(6) You said that the price of the Marconi machine is 50,000 US dollars more expensive than that of the China Electric Company. I don't know on what basis. I have investigated that the bidding for the two large radio station components was opened publicly by five companies: Siemens, the French Long-Distance Telephone Company, the American Joint Venture Company, the China Electric Company, and the Marconi Company. The China Electric Company quoted 138,000 US dollars, and the Marconi Company quoted 42,000 pounds (plus three items: amplitude modulator, broadcast machine, and vacuum tubes, about 4,000 pounds), which is about 148,000 US dollars, about 10,000 US dollars more expensive. But the components are different, and it is not easy to compare. You said that you agreed to sign the communications contract, but agreed to open bidding for the machine purchase, as if these were two unrelated matters. Are you completely unaware that the Ministry of Transportation borrowed British Boxer Indemnity funds to purchase machines, and that the success or failure of the Sino-British communications contract was a condition for the machine purchase? In fact, the draft has been approved by you, and the case has been approved by the Executive Yuan. It is not something that can be changed by empty words. As for your proposal to purchase five telephones worth more than 300,000 US dollars, which was never quoted to various businesses, it seems to be inconsistent with your proposal to purchase through open bidding. As for whether these telephones are needed in China at present and whether the Ministry of Transportation has the financial resources, these are obvious facts and do not need to be repeated.</p>
<p>Loss of Sovereignty</p>
<p>(7) Regarding my personal situation, one statement is that "Wang Chongzhi has a close relationship with the company (American joint venture company), so he deliberately delayed the negotiations." Another statement is that "It is heard that this statement was made by Wang Chongzhi at the instigation of the American joint venture company." May I ask what the meaning of "close relationship" is, and what is the evidence of "instigation"? Please make a clear statement. I am a self-respecting person. How can I be "suddenly slandered"? (8) Article 11 of the Mackay Communications Contract states that the company may use the designated route to solicit business for transmission. This matter was strongly contested by the Water Line Company during the Water Line negotiations in the past. We firmly rejected it on the grounds of sovereignty. Now we are lightly granting it to the Mackay Company. If the Water Line Company demands the same treatment in the future, who will be responsible for the loss of rights? Furthermore, the communications contract states that "Wireless radio direct communication circuits have been established between the United States and Cuba, Colombia, Peru, and Argentina, which can be connected to the Ministry's radio stations for commercial reporting." The intention seems to be to control our country's future communication rights with various South American countries. I cannot help but be extremely worried. (9) Regarding the fact that Chinese and foreign countries have recently published the Wan Guo Telegraph and Telephone Public Affairs Contract, you accused me of intentionally slandering. This is impossible. On the 8th of this month, because I saw that the news published in the Dalu News was not completely true, I published a statement, intending to correct the news. There was not a single word attacking you. The facts are all there. Can you show people the evidence of slandering you?</p>
<p>Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>(1) The Shishi Xinbao published a Reuters New York dispatch on July 24, saying: "Mackay Wireless Telegraph Company announced today that the Chinese National Government has granted the company the concession right to operate Chinese telephone and telegraph..." The significance of this dispatch is very great, and I think you are also deeply aware of it. If it is true, then your claims of breaking the monopoly and abolishing unequal treaties are just a sham. I hope you will announce all the contracts and documents as soon as possible to dispel public doubts. In short, I have always prioritized the cause of serving the country. I deeply hate the actions of foreigners who use huge profits to lure me to achieve their secret control of our country's communication sovereignty. This time, seeing the waste of national funds in wireless telephones and the introduction of wolves into the house and the Mackay contract causing disputes and being self-defeating, I forgot my own humble position and repeatedly expressed my humble opinions to fulfill my national duty. My views have always been inconsistent, and it is natural to attract jealousy. Right and wrong will be left to future generations. Because your statement repeatedly mentioned my name, I have now resigned from the position of Director of the International Telegraph Bureau, so I dare to briefly state one or two things and ask for your scrutiny.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Facilities for Navigation Administration on the Yangtze River <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Among wheel-powered vessel transportation, the most important thing is navigation markers. Transportation prioritizes safety, and markers are crucial for avoiding danger. All countries meticulously research maritime affairs, carefully planning for every contingency. China has also been progressively setting up such markers along its coast and rivers. However, the Yangtze River's course is ever-changing, requiring even greater caution. The administration of navigation markers in our country has long been handled by the Customs Service. In the 31st year of the Guangxu reign (1905), the Customs Service established the River Inspection Department, specifically responsible for Yangtze River markers. The overall situation of this endeavor is worth mentioning. Our newspaper has specially investigated and briefly recorded it below, so that those interested in navigation affairs may have a reference.</p>
<p>The Customs Service's involvement in navigation markers stemmed from the treaty ports agreement, which included provisions for setting up lighthouses along the coast to indicate navigation routes, with arrangements to be discussed by consular officials and trade ministers. At that time, China considered the Customs Service to be an agency established by the Chinese government. Furthermore, few Chinese people were proficient in applying scientific technology. Therefore, the task was entrusted to the Customs Service. Initially, the number of personnel was small, as the quantity of markers depended on the river's conditions and navigation traffic. As navigation increased, more markers were added. Over the past thirty years, the personnel employed by the Customs Service in this area are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Upper Yangtze:</p>
<p>In the 2nd year of the Republic (1913), there were 2 foreign staff and 34 Chinese lighthouse signal personnel. By the 20th year of the Republic (1931), there were 3 foreign staff, 3 Chinese office staff, and 58 lighthouse signal personnel.</p>
<p>Lower Yangtze:</p>
<p>In the 26th year of the Guangxu reign (1900), there were 15 small steamer crew members and 80 lighthouse keepers. In the 2nd year of the Xuantong reign (1910), there were 1 foreign technical specialist, 1 ordinary sailor, 1 Chinese draftsman, 31 small steamer crew members, and 57 lighthouse keepers. In the 9th year of the Republic (1920), there were 5 foreign specialists, 3 ordinary foreign staff, 2 Chinese river affairs clerks, 2 draftsmen, 28 waterway management sampan sailors, 47 small steamer crew members, and 204 lighthouse keepers. In the 19th year of the Republic (1930), there were 15 foreign specialists, 3 Chinese river affairs assistants, 6 clerks, 6 draftsmen, 7 waterway inspectors, 15 repair and miscellaneous staff, 125 small steamer crew members, 242 lighthouse keepers, and 5 water level table recorders. By the 20th year of the Republic (1931), there were 16 foreign specialists (4 on leave), 3 Chinese river affairs assistants, 6 clerks, 6 draftsmen, 8 inspectors, 15 repair staff, 127 small steamer crew members, 288 lighthouse keepers, 52 lighthouse keeper sailors, and 5 recorders. The extent of this rapid growth is evident.</p>
<p>The increase in markers installed over the past thirty years is as follows:</p>
<p>(Upper Yangtze) Xuantong 2nd year Republic 9th year Republic 19th year</p>
<p>Signal Stations 4 20 37</p>
<p>Sampans 1 4</p>
<p>Marker Ships None None 12</p>
<p>Piles 1 4</p>
<p>Water Levels 2 10 77</p>
<p>Shore Marker Flags None None 32</p>
<p>Water Marker Flags 13 13 14</p>
<p>(Middle Yangtze) Xuantong 2nd year Republic 9th year Republic 20th year</p>
<p>Piles 13 20 312</p>
<p>Lightships None 3 2</p>
<p>Marker Ships None None 10</p>
<p>Buoys 26 29 36</p>
<p>Bamboo Buoys Established as needed</p>
<p>Signal Stations None None 2</p>
<p>Survey Sampans 7 9 12</p>
<p>(Lower Yangtze) Guangxu 26th year Xuantong 2nd year Republic 9th year Republic 20th year</p>
<p>Piles 29 39 48 97</p>
<p>Lightships 11 26 44 43</p>
<p>Marker Ships None None 2 3</p>
<p>Buoys 5 3 2 7</p>
<p>Bamboo Buoys Established as needed</p>
<p>The advancement of navigation due to these markers is self-evident. In the middle and upper Yangtze, the draft limit before the 12th year of the Republic (1923) was a minimum of 5 feet and a maximum of 9 feet. Now, it is a minimum of 6.5 feet and a maximum of 22 feet. As a result, ships with a draft of 18 feet can now directly reach Shashi. The draft limit for downstream steamers has also increased. For example, the cargo weight in shallow water and normal times has increased from 180 tons to 1,500 tons. The number of steamship voyages on the upper Yangtze was only 10 in the 3rd year of the Republic (1914), with 100 voyages throughout the year. In the 19th year of the Republic (1930), there were 65 steamships, with 1,149 voyages throughout the year. This is due to the installation of markers, which allows navigation even during shallow water periods. With the increase in navigation frequency and cargo volume, national tax revenue has also increased accordingly. At various Yangtze River ports, the total tonnage of steamships in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign (1900) was 31,582,370 tons, while in the 19th year of the Republic (1930), it was 51,738,671 tons, an increase of 20,56,301 tons. The cargo value in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign (1900) was 190,602,138 taels of customs silver, while in the 19th year of the Republic (1930), it was 561,001,804 taels, an increase of 370,399,666 taels. Tax revenue in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign (1900) was 5,913,247 taels of customs silver, while in the 19th year of the Republic (1930), it was 15,621,710 taels, an increase of 9,708,463 taels. These are substantial figures, demonstrating the importance of markers.</p>
<p>Navigation is not limited to markers alone. Mapping is also essential. The Customs Service's River Inspection Department surveyed 27.5 miles from the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign (1906) to the 2nd year of the Xuantong reign (1910), 248.0 miles from the 1st year of the Republic (1912) to the 9th year of the Republic (1920), 5,386.9 miles from the 10th year of the Republic (1921) to the 19th year of the Republic (1930), and 569.3 miles in the 20th year of the Republic (1931). The mapping process is complex. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), there were 141 resurveys, covering a linear distance of 538 miles. Furthermore, there is the International Lighthouse and Buoy Unification Conference, held in Lisbon in the 19th year of the Republic (1930), which was attended by representatives from the Customs Administration to improve mapping. Besides markers, the piloting of ships themselves is also something that those involved in navigation administration should pay attention to. Yangtze River piloting is divided into three sections: from Shanghai to Hankou is the first section, from Hankou to Yichang is the second section, and from Yichang to Chongqing is the third section. The first section has a pilot association with 31 Chinese, 1 Westerner, and 1 Japanese pilot. There are only 10 Chinese pilots. The second section has no pilot organization; ships are free to hire pilots. The third section has 150 Chinese pilots, managed entirely by the Customs Service in accordance with pilot regulations.</p>
<p>Due to the various necessary facilities such as markers in navigation administration, there must be funding. Those who bear this cost, for the convenience of wheel-powered vessel transportation, collect it from ship cargo taxes, called "ship tax." The ship tax is taken from merchants and designated for specific use. The shortfall is subsidized by the Customs Service, which is also included in the Customs Service's budget. This is an agency that generates profit, aiming to facilitate commerce, eliminate danger, and increase tax revenue, rather than simply a tax-collecting agency that relies on ship tax for income.</p>
<p>China has been managing Yangtze River navigation administration for decades, with the Customs Service's River Inspection Department responsible. The achievements are as described above. It is our belief that the Yangtze River is the sole key to transportation in central China. Before the completion of roads such as the Sichuan-Hankou, Ningxia-Hunan, and Ningxia-Hankou routes, all passenger and cargo transport relied on it. It is hoped that government officials and merchants will pay special attention, allowing the Customs Service to continue its management, achieving greater and newer results from its experience. In the near term, this concerns the safety of navigation administration; in the long term, it concerns national tax revenue, all of which are of utmost importance and cannot be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Case of Intercourse Between Humans and Dogs <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>From March to June,</p>
<p>Performances almost everywhere in major hotels,</p>
<p>Four girls looked haggard,</p>
<p>Trial opened yesterday, spectators barred.</p>
<p>Based on a tip, police officers Tang Jian, a Chinese detective, and Bart, a Western detective, from the Xinzha Police Station raided No. 12, Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road, and uncovered a setup where humans and dogs engaged in intercourse. The main culprits, Chen Xinzhai and Liu Xinshan, and Chen's mistress, Ms. Lu, were arrested, along with a black dog and four girls: Chen Shuanglin, Chen Guilin, Caiyun, and Genling. They were all brought to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details of the human-dog intercourse have been reported in our newspaper. The police investigation revealed that Chen Xinzhai and his wife repeatedly took Shuanglin and the other three girls and the black dog to Rooms 119 and 115 of the Oriental Hotel on Zhejiang Road, Room 217 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Xizang Road, Room 205 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road, and Room 217 of the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road between March and June this year to perform these inhumane acts of human-dog sexual intercourse. Each performance required at least ten viewers, and each person had to pay five dollars. Therefore, they earned at least fifty dollars per performance. Liu Xinshan also assisted Mr. and Mrs. Chen in committing these criminal acts. The four girls were sent to Guangren Hospital, where it was confirmed that their lower bodies had been damaged. The black dog was also sent to a dog examination center. On the 26th and 27th of this month, Chinese and Western detectives took the four girls to the various hotels to reenact the performances, some on beds, some on sofas, etc. Yesterday morning, Magistrate Wu Tingqi continued the trial of the case in the Second Criminal Court. The black dog and the four girls were brought to the court, and more than a hundred people were in attendance, mostly women. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang requested that spectators be barred from the courtroom, citing the case's impact on public morals. The court granted the request. The spectators, who had come full of excitement, left disappointed. After the spectators left, police lawyer Wang rose and stated that the prosecution was in accordance with Articles 241 and 257 of the Criminal Code. He then detailed the detectives' reenactment of the performances at the hotels with the children. The defendants had rented Room 115 at the Oriental Hotel for a month, from April 11th to May 11th. They later rented Rooms 116 and 119 for a considerable period. Overall, the duration was extremely long. These performances also took place in Rooms 115 and 119, making it difficult for the hotel staff not to be aware of the situation, suggesting that they had assisted in the obscene acts. The court then examined the hotel registration book, confirmed its accuracy, and questioned the staff on duty. Subsequently, the four girls were brought before the court. Caiyun and Genling were only five years old and had just been weaned. Therefore, one was held in the arms of a Jiliang Institute worker, while the other sat on the lawyer's bench, allowing the magistrate to question them up close. The two girls looked particularly haggard. Shuanglin and Guilin stood before the lawyer's bench, with Shuanglin doing most of the answering, as the eleven-year-old was more mentally capable than the five-year-olds. After Shuanglin recounted the entire situation, Mr. and Mrs. Chen still tried to deny it. The court then ordered the black dog to be brought out. The dog, about a foot long and covered in black fur, immediately rushed toward the four girls, displaying various aggressive behaviors. Representatives from the four hotels then filed a report, stating that they were unaware of such events. Chen Shuanglin also submitted a petition detailing the training for human-dog intercourse, claiming that in addition to Mr. and Mrs. Chen, there was also a "Old Seven" (who is now on the run). Chen Xinzhai's face was full of smoke and his spirits were low, suggesting that he had been suffering from withdrawal for many days. However, his mistress, Chen Lu, was fat and had a well-fed appearance. Her responses were also quite fluent. Therefore, she firmly denied all accusations, claiming that they were framed by the mistress of "Old Seven," who had a grudge against them. They hired lawyer Gan Lin to defend them. Lawyer Gan asked the court to question the four girls about whether they had taken off their clothes during the performances. When Shuanglin was asked, she replied that they had not. The police lawyer then stated that the suspects often had the victims wear "split pants" during the performances, and that the victims could be asked again. When Shuanglin was asked again, she confirmed that they did wear "split pants," indicating that this aspect was irrelevant. Subsequently, Magistrate Wu adjourned the case for another hearing and ordered the four girls to be examined by a forensic doctor.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Roulette Gambling Den Uncovered on Route Ghisi <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Undercover detectives pose as gamblers,</p>
<p>A large quantity of gambling paraphernalia confiscated.</p>
<p>The French Concession police have recently been conducting strict investigations and crackdowns on prohibited activities such as opium and gambling within the concession. They learned that a Westerner had been running a large private roulette gambling den at No. 809, Route Ghisi, with tens of thousands of dollars changing hands, in violation of the prohibition order. At 10 PM the night before, Western Detective Chief Xia Cai'er, along with Western Detectives He Licai, Ge Lai'er, Da Ershang, Chinese Detective Inspector Shen Defu, Chief Detective He Tugeng, Deputy Detective Liu Kunbao, and undercover detectives Dai Rongji, Zhang Wenliang, Kong Qingtong, Bai Xiuhui, etc., traveled in separate cars, quietly and without raising suspicion, to conduct a raid. The location was spacious, with gardens and open spaces surrounding it, covering an area of over thirty mu. The gambling den was deep inside, with people stationed around to keep watch, making it difficult to raid. Therefore, the Western Detective Chief instructed the detectives to disguise themselves as gamblers and enter one by one. When the gamblers were in the midst of their excitement, the detectives gave a signal and surrounded the area, arresting on the spot Russian Bai Xigao Fu, Chinese Wang Mengwan, Zhao Jinhua, Li Fangsheng, Li Ayou, Chen Xiaoliang, Shen Jinzhang, Wang Fubao, Lu Dahai, Gao Zhenfu, Chen Jiande, Wang Baoren, Pan Dong, Xu Xuesheng, Shi Wencai, Luo Yupei, Zhu Quancai, Zhang Yutang, Liu Wenjin, Xu Xuehou, Jiang Shasi, Qiao Xiaomao, Wu Xingong, Yao Zhiliang, Yuan Chunfang, Wang Juhai, and a woman named Xia Wangshi, totaling twenty-seven men and women. Seven other gamblers were also arrested. Confiscated gambling paraphernalia included a roulette wheel, two table cloths, twenty-two boxes of chips (approximately three thousand pieces), three dice, as well as five sets of opium smoking paraphernalia, including attachments, opium sticks, opium boxes, and ledgers. All were taken to the police station. After interrogation, seven gamblers were released on bail of thirty dollars each, pending further instructions. The remaining suspects were detained. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court.

<h3 id="e107">Three Robbers Steal Mauser Pistol and Shoot Two Policemen <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>One policeman shot in the waist, life in danger.</p>
<p>At 9:40 PM last night, police officer Sun Jiming from the Liyuan Road sub-station of the Second District was patrolling the intersection of Xieqiao Liyuan Road and Xinjiao Road, carrying a Mauser pistol with the number 71326. Suddenly, three robbers appeared from the north. One was wearing a black silk shirt and pants with slippers, and the other two were wearing blue cloth shorts and shirts. One of the robbers, wearing a blue cloth shirt, grabbed patrolman Sun Jiming around the waist. The robber wearing the black silk shirt and pants fired a shot, hitting the officer in the left leg. The officer immediately fell to the ground, and the robbers snatched the Mauser pistol. The wounded officer, still conscious, blew his whistle to alert others. Police officer Zhang Hanchen, who was resting nearby, heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. He was also shot by the robbers in the waist. The officer endured the pain and rushed to the Liyuanhou sub-station to report the incident and request assistance. District Chief Zhang immediately dispatched Patrol Leader Zhang Cishan and four police officers, and also joined forces with Detective Team Leader Han Ruisheng and detectives Zeng Baolin, Yuan Mingcai, Shen Jinchu, and Chen Wentong to search the area. At the intersection of No. 190, they found an empty Mauser pistol case. It was reported that after the three robbers stole the Mauser pistol and shot two policemen, they fired another shot into the air to intimidate people and fled south toward Shenyi Road after seeing a crowd gathering on the street. The two wounded police officers were taken to Shanghai Hospital by the sub-station's vehicle for treatment. It was reported that the officer shot in the waist was in critical condition.</p>

<p>Letter to Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to various trade associations in the city stating that at the third executive committee meeting of this month, the proposals of Committee Members Zhu Wenqi and Luo Qinghua were discussed. The proposals suggested that the executive and supervisory committee members of the Chamber of Commerce and representatives of various trade associations should unanimously participate in the Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance. The letter stated: "Our country has been ravaged by years of continuous civil war, leading to economic devastation and national decline, which has emboldened powerful neighbors to engage in territorial encroachment and annexation. The Northeast has fallen into enemy hands due to the policy of non-resistance, and the Shanghai War failed due to lack of support. Those with a sense of responsibility, tracing the root causes, are deeply saddened by the national crisis caused by years of civil war. The third session of the Chamber of Commerce's members' representative conference passed a resolution stating that the Chamber of Commerce should work to abolish civil war and promote domestic goods. However, a mere declaration is not enough to alleviate the current difficulties. Action is needed to benefit the country. Recently, a Grand Alliance to Abolish Civil War has been organized in our country. The members of our Chamber of Commerce should uphold the resolutions of the representative conference and unanimously participate in the Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance with representatives from various trade associations, in order to pool our efforts to end the chaos and resist foreign aggression. We hope that you will consider this matter carefully and make a decision. We are confident that this matter concerns the national salvation plan and we have unanimously agreed to pass it. In addition to sending letters, we are also sending this notice to inform you and hope that you will investigate and unanimously participate in the Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance to advance our cause together. We hope that you will do so."</p>

<h3 id="e110">Report on Disaster Relief in Wuhu <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>A Tragic Story of Selling His Wife to Save His Family</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society at No. 12, Renji Road, is aware that the spring drought in Anhui Province is particularly severe. In addition to the counties of Xuancheng, Wuwei, and Nanling, which have already been allocated large sums of relief funds, the suffering of farmers in various villages in Wuhu is even more tragic. Yesterday, another 10,000 yuan was allocated and sent to the Wuhu branch for distribution. The following is an excerpt from the disaster relief diary reported by the special disaster relief commissioner of the branch, which reveals the plight of those who have been forced to sell their wives to save their daughters: "On July 2nd, when distributing relief in Huanjia Village, we met a man named Huan Zengyou. This man is over sixty years old and is known for his honesty and selflessness. He has four sons (the eldest son died early), four daughters-in-law, six grandsons, two granddaughters, and two granddaughters-in-law. It can be said that he is blessed with a large family. However, since the severe flooding last year, there has been no harvest, and the family's livelihood has been disrupted. By this spring, they could no longer sustain themselves. The third son, Shouzhong, who is educated and knows propriety, has always been filial and respectful. Seeing that there was no rice left in the house and no way to borrow money, he was willing to sacrifice the love and affection between husband and wife and sell his twenty-five-year-old wife to another man for ninety yuan to save the lives of his family of more than ten people. It is said that before Shouzhong sold his wife, the brothers had an important meeting and all proposed drawing lots to sell a wife to save the whole family. However, Shouzhong did not agree with this idea, saying that his eldest sister-in-law was a widow with four children, his second sister-in-law also had many children, and his fourth sister-in-law had not even been married for a year. If they drew lots and chose one of the eldest sister-in-law, the second sister-in-law, or the fourth sister-in-law, wouldn't that be a sin for my third brother? Regardless, they should not be sold. Furthermore, I cannot allow my brothers to sell their wives to support my useless couple. It is better to sell my wife, which is more appropriate. After Shouzhong said this, the brothers all shed tears and cried bitterly. As a result, it was decided to sell Shouzhong's wife. When Shouzhong's wife learned of this, she cried and begged her husband to go out and beg for food to support his father. Shouzhong told her that this would not save the whole family and tearfully tried to persuade her. His wife could not be persuaded and knelt down and cried. On the day before their separation, she could not eat and sobbed uncontrollably. The scene was unbearable. Later, it was said that his wife cried all day long at her new husband's home, thinking about Shouzhong. Shouzhong's actions are truly admirable and worthy of respect. His wife's sorrowful separation can be described as tragic. Seeing the situation, we felt pity and sought economic assistance from all parties, hoping to redeem Shouzhong's wife and reunite them, bringing happiness to the whole family. Upon hearing this story, all of you must feel sympathy and want to help restore this true love. Therefore, we have recorded it in detail after returning home."</p>

We have forwarded this instruction to our bureau to propose a date for the takeover for approval. According to the investigation, the contractor was established on March 21st of last year. It is now scheduled for recovery on August 20th. In addition to reporting this separately, we are sending this letter for your information." The Sales Bureau has complied with the people's wishes and accelerated the recovery. The people of Wenzhou and Chuzhou can soon escape from their suffering.</p>

<p>During the martial law period this year, the Russian division of the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps recruited additional personnel. After discussion by the Shanghai Municipal Council Preparedness Committee, it was deemed that these corps members had received training, and if financially feasible, a portion could be retained. Subsequently, the Board of Directors consulted the Finance Committee on the matter. After careful consideration, the committee recommended that the Board of Directors approve the retention of 73 of these Russian members for the remainder of the year. However, the financial situation should be reviewed again at the end of the year, and this should not be taken as a precedent for increasing the number of Russian members or increasing expenses after 1933. This recommendation was adopted by the Board of Directors this past Wednesday.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Orphanage Completes Reunion <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>You Sha Travels 5,000 Li to Find Daughter</p>
<p>Gu Youdao Celebrates Obtaining a Jewel</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tzu Er Jiao Yang Yuan (Orphanage), affiliated with the Chinese National Child Welfare Association, rescued a kidnapped maidservant named You Xialan in April of the 19th year of the Republic (1930). When the girl was kidnapped, she was only six years old. She only knew that her father's name was You Sha Wu and that he lived near Jing Tou in Yang Kou, Changshan, making tofu for a living. She knew nothing else. The Tzu Er Jiao Yang Yuan initially sent people to Changshan County, Zhejiang Province, to investigate. Then, after carefully examining the girl's accent, they found it was similar to that of Jiangxi. Upon checking postal routes, they discovered a place called Yang Kou in Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province. The orphanage immediately sent a letter to the county government requesting an investigation. Later, they received a letter from You Sha Wu claiming that Xialan was indeed his daughter and had been kidnapped three years earlier. Upon learning of the whereabouts, the orphanage sent a letter urging him to come and claim her. Coincidentally, Gu Youdao, a resident of Beixin Jing, had no children and wanted to adopt a daughter to ease his loneliness. He and his wife visited the orphanage, and they fell in love with Xialan at first sight. They immediately requested to adopt her. The orphanage declined the request because Xialan had a father. After a few days, You Sha Wu indeed traveled thousands of miles to Shanghai. Father and daughter met, their joy and sorrow indescribable. However, You Sha Wu's family was very poor. His intention this time was just to see her, not to take her home. Now that he learned that the Gu family loved this girl and that the girl also wanted to stay with them, he readily agreed to the arrangement. From then on, the two families would be relatives, and the poor girl would have found her place. The orphanage went to Changshan in Zhejiang and then to Guangfeng in Jiangxi to search for the girl's family. They finally found her biological father, allowing the family to reunite. Their meticulous efforts are commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Report on Cholera by the Seaport Quarantine Office <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Wu Liande, Director of the Seaport Quarantine Office and Director of the Central Cholera Prevention Bureau, released the ninth cholera report yesterday (the 27th), as follows: (1) Cholera in Shanghai has clearly reached its peak. As of the end of the week of July 23rd, a total of 411 new cases were discovered during the past week, with 36 deaths. A breakdown by area is listed below:</p>
<p>Area Cases Deaths</p>
<p>Shanghai City 82 9 (1 foreign national)</p>
<p>International Settlement 266 (8 foreign nationals) 24 (2 foreign nationals)</p>
<p>French Concession 31 (2 foreign nationals) 2</p>
<p>Unspecified Areas 32 1</p>
<p>Total Last Week 411 (11 foreign nationals) 36 (5 foreign nationals)</p>
<p>Total Previously 1655 (24 foreign nationals) 98 (8 foreign nationals)</p>
<p>Total as of Last Weekend 2066 (35 foreign nationals)</p>
<p>134 Deaths (11 foreign nationals). (2) According to the weekly report of the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the total number of cholera patients was 617, which is 206 more. However, the above numbers were not based on bacteriological examination. Subsequently, the authorities of the Health Examination Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Municipal Health Laboratory declared that approximately 30% of the stool samples examined were positive. The examination procedures included (a) culture, (b) indole reaction, and (c) serum agglutination reaction. (3) Of the above numbers, the number of foreign cholera patients last week was 11, which is higher than before. However, the mortality rate for this cholera outbreak in Shanghai is still the lowest, only 6.4%. (4) The current cholera outbreak seems to be related to the climate. The previous 8th report reported that the temperature had reached 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, with a humidity of 95 degrees. However, the highest temperature in the shade last week was 100.9 degrees, with an average of 90.6 degrees, and an average humidity of 80.2 degrees. (5) The cholera epidemic is widespread in the country this year, reaching Guangzhou in the south and Changchun in the north. Its ferocity is similar to that of tropical areas such as Siam and Annam. Until last year, it was almost an annual scourge. Also, the Calcutta area of India (population 1.5 million) reports approximately 150 cholera patients per week, with a mortality rate of 40% to 50%. Bombay, however, has not been affected. (6) The results of cholera prevention in various cholera-affected areas in the country this year are good. In my opinion, there are three main reasons: (a) Regarding the health authorities: 1. Careful preparation to supply safe drinking water; 2. Strict control of vegetable markets, restaurants, cold drink shops, and other public places; 3. Control of food vendors and others related to food shops; 4. Cholera vaccination for citizens; 5. Organization of bacteriological examination offices; 6. Strict implementation of seaport quarantine, isolation, and other epidemic prevention measures. (b) Regarding all sectors of society: 1. Assisting health organizations in implementing cholera prevention measures; 2. Urging health authorities to improve all necessary defenses; 3. Establishing charitable organizations and promoting high-level knowledge among the public; 4. Conducting joint research on good methods during non-epidemic periods to prevent the recurrence of epidemics. (c) Regarding individuals: 1. Each individual using new methods to protect the safety of their family; 2. Using health and hospitals to prevent and treat the disease; 3. Using the power of charity to help the poor and needy. (7) The Shandong ship departed from Shanghai for Shantou on July 19. Because a helmsman suddenly contracted cholera, it returned to the port on the evening of the same day. The quarantine officer went to the ship at 4 a.m. the next morning to quarantine it, vaccinated all crew members and passengers against cholera, and sent the patient to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road for treatment. His life could only be extended by three days. Although the dangerous symptoms disappeared, he eventually died of uremia. This was because the person had a smoking habit, which led to kidney failure. (8) Passengers traveling from Xiamen and Shantou to Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, and the Philippines must be vaccinated against cholera before leaving port. The same applies to those traveling from Shanghai to Qingdao, Java, and Luzon.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange's brokers' cotton yarn futures trading has always used Shenxin Factory's Zhong brand cotton yarn as the standard. Substitutes are also limited to those listed in the grade table. The exchange recently received reports of private spot trading occurring. It specifically posted the following notice in the market hall the other day:</p>
<p>The subject matter of trading in this exchange is specified separately in the exchange's cotton yarn and cotton grade table. Cotton yarn and cotton that are not listed in the grade table, regardless of the method adopted, may not be traded in the exchange's market. In addition, spot trading was originally within the scope of the exchange's business. Although the exchange currently only holds futures trading, it has not abandoned the franchise for spot trading and should be protected by law. Recently, it has been heard that some people are privately doing spot trading in the exchange's rest area. The type of subject matter is unknown. These messages have been reported by outsiders and do not seem to be completely unfounded. If this behavior does exist, it not only violates the Exchange Law and the exchange's operating rules but also infringes upon the exchange's franchise for spot trading and should be subject to legal sanctions. In addition to sending a separate letter to the Brokers Association for thorough investigation, the joint notice is hereby issued, hoping that all brokers will assist the exchange in unanimously banning this illegal behavior to respect the law and prevent malpractices. Your cooperation is highly anticipated.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Photographic Reproduction of the Song Dynasty Qisha Tripitaka <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The translation and publication of Buddhist scriptures in China initially only had handwritten copies. Later, there were stone carvings, and then wood carvings. With the advancement of printing, circulation became more convenient and widespread. This flourished during the Song Dynasty. The Shu version of the Northern Song Dynasty, the Eastern Chan Temple version of Fuzhou, the Kaiyuan Temple version of Fuzhou in the Southern Song Dynasty, the Wang Yong Cong version of Sixi, the Zifu Temple version of Sixi, and the Yansheng Temple version of Qisha were all renowned among versions. However, today, to see their relics, the Shu version is as rare as a phoenix, and even the five versions after the Eastern Chan version have only a few fragments or later supplementary versions that are not original prints in domestic and foreign collections. Now, the Qisha Tripitaka reproduced in Shanghai is complete and is the original print, which is extremely rare. The planning of the Qisha Tripitaka began during the Duanping era of Emperor Lizong of the Song Dynasty (1272 AD). Biqiu Zizhi Hong of the Yansheng Temple in Qisha, Pingjiang Prefecture, vowed to amputate his arm and raise funds to publish the complete collection of sutras, precepts, and treatises. It was completed during the reign of Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty. The original was in the form of a Sanskrit scroll. The collections of the Wolong and Kaiyuan Temples in Xi'an are now preserved by the Shaanxi Provincial Library. Zhu Qing Lan discovered them last year while distributing relief. Each block has five pages, each page has six lines, and each line has seventeen characters. There are Jiaxi (1273 AD) and Chunyou (1281 AD) era names. Ye Gong Chuo, Jiang Wei Qiao, Di Bao Xian, Xu Nai Chang, Ding Fu Bao, Wu Zhao Zeng, Li Jing Wei, and others all believe that the Dharma repository, which has been submerged for a long time, has encountered an opportunity to flourish. It will make many contributions to world culture and art. They discussed reproducing and distributing it. The Shanghai Song Edition Tripitaka Reproduction Association was organized to be responsible for the reproduction. All distribution matters were entrusted to the Buddhist Studies Bookstore. They were responsible for compiling and checking the scriptures, collecting missing chapters, ordering printing paper, and selecting and hiring teachers, preparing glass plates, and going to Shaanxi for photography. After experiencing various difficulties, they have achieved considerable success. It is estimated that 500 copies will be reproduced, each with more than 6,000 volumes, and books will be published in installments. It will take two years to complete the publication. Pre-orders are priced at 525 yuan. A notice will be published in the newspaper soon. The reporter has seen the original scriptures. The calligraphy is ancient and elegant, the engraving is exquisite, and there are very few errors or omissions. The Buddhist images carved at the beginning of the volumes are especially solemn and beautiful. The calligraphers and engravers of the time made vows and signed their names, which contained merit, which is different from other books that are done for profit and perfunctorily. To study, recite, and collate it, it is truly possible to clarify the obstacles of later editions. Libraries and academics will likely rush to order it.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Establishment of the City Center Land Owner Association <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>In order to solve the housing problem for citizens, the Shanghai Municipal Government announced the solicitation of land in the city center area of approximately 1,000 mu last year. At that time, there was a very enthusiastic response from the people claiming to own the land. The Municipal Government also actively carried out construction projects. Unfortunately, after the January 28 Incident, all projects could not be implemented. Now that the Japanese army has withdrawn, the Municipal Government is continuing to handle the matter according to the original plan. The landowners believe that the prosperity of the city center area is crucial to the livelihood of all citizens. They specifically elected Li Bohan, Li Yunchen, Yao Xian, Xia Ping Fang, and Dong Cheng Dao as preparatory committee members to organize the City Center Land Owner Association, hoping to cooperate with the Municipal Government to promote the construction of the urban area. It is heard that the draft articles of association have been drafted and the inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 30th of this month at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road to pass the articles of association and elect officers.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Embezzlement Case of Manager of Textiles Store <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Judge Reprimands Defendant's Base Behavior</p>
<p>Zhou Jinhua, a local man who was the manager of the Yu Feng Yuan Foreign Goods Textiles Store at 578 East Xihua De Road, was accused of embezzling more than 17,000 yuan of capital by forging deposit slips with fraudulent means between January and June of this year and fleeing. The general manager, Zhou Xiong Cai, reported the matter to the Huishan Police Department, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest Zhou Jinhua and escort him to the First Special District Court. It was found that the amount of the virtual deposits in the account books was quite inconsistent. The defendant was ordered to pay 20,000 yuan in substantial shop security, and an accountant was instructed to thoroughly check the accounts. This has already been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin continued the trial in the Fourth Criminal Court. According to the plaintiff's attorney, Lu Qi, during the adjournment, accountant Zhao found that the prices of the goods and pieces ordered by the defendant with various foreign firms were not stated, and there were many malpractices. The deposits of more than ten households, including the Chun Ji household, were completely fabricated. Subsequently, the plaintiff Zhou Xiong Cai testified that the funds handled by the defendant were all unreliable. Accountant Zhao Zuwei also provided a certificate. When questioned by Zhou Jinhua, his statements were evasive, saying that the prices of the goods ordered with various foreign firms were based on pounds and shillings, and all the depositors were not fabricated and that they all existed. The court announced that during the previous trial, the deposit of Yuchangxiang Foreign Goods Store was testified to be false by the store's manager, Zhou, who was a member of the same clan as you. Your behavior is clearly base. The court then ordered the case to be adjourned for further verification. The defendant was still released on the original bail.</p>

<p>Dock Workers: The Shanghai Dock Workers Promoting the Implementation of the 28 System Committee declared, "For the Reference of All Sectors of Society: We, the dock workers, rely on our flesh and blood year-round, braving the wind and dew, toiling under the scorching sun in the summer and wading through ice and snow in the winter. Our lives are lighter than chickens and dogs, and our labor exceeds that of cattle and horses, but the wages we receive are extremely low. Individual sustenance is insufficient, let alone family life. Therefore, the lives of our dock workers are the most miserable among the working masses. Moreover, there are labor contractors who exploit us, squeezing our lifeblood. Of the fixed wages, the workers only actually receive 20-30%, while the contractors take 70-80%. These contractors gain without labor, reaping huge profits, and are able to paint rafters and carve beams, with courtyards full of wives and concubines, wearing fine clothes and eating rich food, with horse-drawn carriages racing, treating our 70,000 workers as slaves, while they sit proudly as southern-facing kings. This kind of feudal contracting system, from the standpoint of the interests of our workers themselves and from the standpoint of humanitarian justice, has absolutely no reason to exist. Moreover, the abolition of the contracting system is clearly stated in the Party's program. Therefore, under the rule of the current National Government, this contracting system has no possibility of being preserved. Previously, the Central Government, taking into account the actual situation, did not decisively implement the abolition, but on December 24, 1928, convened three representatives each from labor and contracting parties and formulated six principles. Our workers have always supported the Central Government's intentions and accepted them all immediately. However, the contracting party has resisted implementing the third principle: 'The contracting system is still temporarily allowed to exist, but the amount of the contractor's deduction of contract money shall not exceed 20% of the total amount, and the worker shall receive 80%. The allocation of import and export surcharges shall be temporarily based on the 28 ratio. The Suzhou Creek surcharge shall still be based on its old customs.' For more than three years now, the contracting party has refused to fulfill this principle. In this age of material civilization, the cost of living increases year by year, and the price of everything in Shanghai is even higher than in other cities. The wages that our workers earn with blood and sweat are forcibly exploited, making it impossible for them to sustain themselves. The hardships of the past few years can no longer be tolerated. Therefore, last month, we submitted a petition to the central Party and government authorities, requesting the implementation of the previous case. Now, having understood the suffering of the workers, the central Party headquarters and the Ministry of Industry have each sent special commissioners to Shanghai and have consulted with the Party and government agencies in this city to assist in handling the matter. At present, all of our dock workers in the city are holding onto great hope, quietly waiting for the authorities to handle the matter. If the contracting party stubbornly clings to its private views and refuses to implement the 28 system, then all of our workers will take effective measures to negotiate with the contracting party, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal. We hope that all sectors of society will understand the suffering of the lives of our dock workers and provide strong assistance, for which we will be endlessly grateful. This is our declaration."</p>

<h3 id="e145">Faculty and Students of Jinan University Petition for the Abolition of Colleges <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Faculty and students of Jinan University in Shanghai, regarding the abolition of the College of Law and the College of Education, divided into four groups (current students, the Shanghai Alumni Association, the Overseas Chinese Student Union, and the Professors' Association), totaling about 20 representatives, have been in Beijing since the 25th, petitioning in various directions. On the morning of the 27th, Wang Wei, Ping Zuren, Wei Zhenhua, and others, representatives of the Alumni Association, went to the Ministry of Education to petition. Secretary Gao Tingzi received the representatives and stated the reasons for requesting the withdrawal of the order to abolish the colleges. The reasons were: (1) Jinan is the highest institution of higher learning for overseas Chinese, so education focuses on overseas Chinese. Jinan has a well-equipped law school that can train overseas Chinese diplomatic talents. (2) Jinan University is a whole national education institution. The College of Education studies the customs of overseas Chinese land temples, using the power of education to improve them, so that overseas Chinese can stand on an equal footing and develop the industry and commerce of Southeast Asia through the power of education. (3) Overseas Chinese have donated funds and made various contributions to the government. It seems inappropriate not to help expand the only overseas Chinese Jinan University in Shanghai, and to abolish it. Moreover, this matter was not discussed with the school authorities in advance, so the school has already hired many professors. It is difficult to reverse the contract with the professors due to the sudden abolition of the school, which is extremely difficult in practice. Secretary Gao said that the government has a whole plan for this matter, and the Ministry of Education cannot provide relief, only promising to convey the representatives' intentions to the vice ministers. Although the representatives still requested to see the vice ministers, they did not get what they wanted.</p>
<h3 id="e146">A Glimpse of the Measures of the Wuxian County Education Bureau <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>As the school year is about to begin, the Wuxian County Education Bureau is urgently proceeding with the transfer of principals and curators and all reforms, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Transferring Principals: Wei Yingsun (Huguan), Cheng Junchang (Taowu), Ding Bin (Chenglou), Chen Fuhai (Wanli), Pan Jufen (Gexiang), Yang Bingshu (Shuzhuang), Cao Zhangming (Longqiao), Wang Enyu (Huanglu), Cao Shicang (Hengtang), Shi Jian (Qizhuang), Hu Qinsun (Xiangshan), Tao Engan (Peiyu), Ding Jida (Zhangzhuang), Zhang Ruisheng (Yaoshe), Wang Zhihuai (Zhoushan), Zhu Tongshu (Changxiang), Wang Yuantai (Lianxi), Shen Heming (Xingcun), Wu Zengshao (Zhanshang), Zheng Huanrong (Huangqiao), Ma Chujiu (Yaocun), Li Zhuyi (Yanli Pilot).</p>
<p>Selecting Curators: The folk education area is divided into ten districts, which were previously announced. However, the folk education center in Bendu is too inconvenient for both Wangshan and Shanqiao. It has now been decided to divide Shanqiao into the eleventh folk education district and to establish a Shanqiao Agricultural Education Center. The candidate for the head of the agricultural education center is still being selected according to the new village plan in the 20th Autonomous Region. The other Dongshan Folk Education Center Curator is Wang Yueyun, and the Huguan Folk Education Center Curator is Chen Yifei.</p>
<p>Regulations on Fees: The Education Bureau has revised the provisional regulations for collecting various fees in primary schools. The second and third items stipulate that each primary school may collect fees for learning materials each semester. This refers to the maximum limit. If any school does not collect fees or collects less than this regulation, it should continue to do so.</p>

Therefore, the school not only has the restoration of its old appearance, but also has a promising expansion in the future. Recently, the beginning of enrollment preparation, in addition to recruiting first-year students, also to rescue first-year students who dropped out of school due to the war, a first-year second-semester class will be opened.

The school's articles of association have been printed and will be sent upon request.</p>

<p>In the Youyou Cup, Guo Qida was unable to make up for the game with Qian Yaobin yesterday due to illness, so it was rescheduled again. Qian then competed with Cheng Yize, and because it was dark, the third set was not played. Qian's victory over Cheng in two sets took a lot of effort. Yu Tianguang often lost the first set in the competition. This was because there was too little competition practice. Yesterday, Yu won over Tu only two to one. Wu Zhuren withdrew due to busy affairs. The results of the previous games with Wu were cancelled. Shen Baigui changed to compete with Mao Hongze.

<p>Drafted new records distributed to various regional advancement associations and major sports meets for verification</p>
<p>The National Sports Advancement Association, in order to review and determine the national track and field highest records for the 20th year, drafted several new records and distributed them on December 23rd of last year to various regional advancement associations and major sports meets for verification and confirmation, so that they could be formally reviewed and approved by the board of directors. However, due to the impact of the national crisis, no definite feedback has been received from the various associations to date, resulting in a standstill. It is now learned that the association has reprinted the draft records to urge the various regional sports associations to promptly verify the validity of the achievements in their respective regions, in the hope that they can be formally reviewed and announced by mid-September of this year. Attached is the association's letter to the various regional sports associations:</p>
<p>Respectfully, regarding the review and determination of the 20th year national men's and women's track and field records, we have specially sent you a copy of the draft new records for the 20th year men's and women's track and field events, requesting your association to review whether the records in your region are appropriate and provide formal certification. If there are other better achievements that have not been included, please supplement them so that this association can review and determine them accordingly. It has been more than half a year since this request was made, and we have not received a reply. We are now enclosing two more copies of the aforementioned draft records, and we hope that your association will comply with the previous letter and reply promptly by mid-September for formal review. This is our earnest hope. Sincerely, China National Sports Advancement Association, July 27th, 21st year.</p>

<p>Excerpts from Ninety-Three-Year-Old Ma Xiangbo</p>
<h3 id="e160">Innate Intelligence <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The poison of the emperor's ideology in our common people can be said to be deeply rooted. I still remember that during the Xianfeng era, there was a Chongming licentiate who went to the palace examination for re-examination. The meaning of this re-examination was to check whether there was any cheating. The examination question was: "With intention, striking the chime?"! As a result of the examination, the licentiate was greatly favored by the emperor, and Xianfeng issued an edict that "this writing shall be the eternal law."</p>
<p>At that time, I heard the teacher say this to me, and I was very puzzled in my heart. I boldly asked the teacher:</p>
<p>"Does Xianfeng himself understand the eight-legged essay? How can he know that this article should be the eternal law?"</p>
<p>My teacher, upon hearing this, repeatedly shook his head, extremely frightened, and rebuked me: "The Son of Heaven is born with innate intelligence, how can you, a young man, talk nonsense?" This shows that at that time, no one dared to say a bad word about the emperor. The greater the emperor's power, the deeper the nation's laziness.</p>
<p>If based on the principle of "those with virtue have authority," Confucius should have become the emperor long ago. However, Confucius could only be an uncrowned king, and later generations only called him the "plain king." As for the emperor, he was born with innate intelligence, a "naturally born Confucius." Our people, poisoned by this emperorism, would have no new ideas or new knowledge. The common people were all frightened, and everyone lived in terror. Who would have the courage to create? Therefore, even Chinese rebellions had to rely on gods and ghosts, saying that they were acting on heaven's behalf.</p>
<p>In fact, the emperors of China's past dynasties were very naive. Qin Shi Huang can be regarded as an enlightened ruler, and he had the idea of reform. He was even able to achieve the major policy of changing the feudal system to a system of prefectures and counties. However, he eventually built the Great Wall, wanting to shut out the Xiongnu from thousands of miles away and close the door to rest easy! He only wanted to be a closed-door emperor, and did not want to be a king of the world who expanded his territory.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Cooling Powder <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>Summer is suitable for taking something cooling. However, Rehe is tense again. It is an extremely hot stimulant.</p>
<p>When the Nineteenth Route Army resisted, it happened to be a time of flying rain and snow, severe cold and freezing. At a time when water dripped into beads, they did not need to hide in the trenches and drink the cold wind. From the extremely low temperature that froze their limbs and the starving soldiers' lives, they had to pick up their guns and charge in the rain and snow. Just hiding next to a raging fire, listening to the news reports on the radio, even in the depths of winter, it was still warm and comfortable.</p>
<p>But now, in weather that is heating up to over 100 degrees, the Northeast heroes are in the fiery sand, under the scorching sun that can make people faint and suffocate, and in the rain of bullets like a storm, using the battle of their lives to win the glory of the nation. Although it is a fiery battlefield, the more enemies they can kill, the more it is like taking a dose of cooling powder.</p>
<p>It is reported that more than 3,000 enemy troops from Heilongjiang were riding in a train passing through Gaolingzi, when the National Salvation Army used three freight cars, which were placed in advance on the top of the mountain. When the train arrived, these three freight cars rolled down the hillside, instantly smashing seven sections in the middle of the dozen or so train cars. At the same time, the gunpowder in the cars exploded, and more than 400 people died under these freight cars and gunpowder. This kind of method of killing the enemy is just like taking a dose of extremely cold cooling powder in the summer. But we cannot deny that the people of Shanghai are only able to seek comfort. Under the modern era, there is no shortage of fragrant and palatable cooling powders. Facing the Japanese army's stimulant for coveting Rehe, at least it is like the Northeast, seeing it sink into decline in recent years and gradually regarding it as nothing. How can people believe that we can have a day to turn things around?</p>
<p>Jade Pendant Ring: On the morning of June 23rd, I woke up unable to complete my dream, thinking of Su Qu's birthday tomorrow. I sadly composed this poem and inscribed it on a ten-foot-wide painting of white lotus painted by Great Thousand Layman, depicting sleeping old mandarin ducks who do not marry. I also recorded Tianchi's verse in the painting. – Yu Cen</p>
<p>The moon falls in the guest's courtyard, and I am startled awake at my pillow. The powder-white dress is like jade, not yet cold is the autumn river. I do not trust the stars, they seem like tears hard to gather. Old feelings want to tease, suing to the hairpin, fearing the single boat lightly leaving, originally wrong. Bearing the graceful opening on the river, sleeping old mandarin ducks, people alone still recall the pleated skirt of Liu Xian. Early west wind secretly warns, Lingbo's eyes are clear, the water chestnut blossoms. A dream, light dust, dim years are like a hub, stubborn silk lotus root, exhausted heart, lotus bitter. Redeeming the calamity, the withered fragrance is all thin. Giving Wei Lang today's heartfelt feelings, not worth the slightly furrowed brow of the moth.</p>

<p>— Wang Yu</p>
<p>Many say that old people have a sense of twilight and are not worth discussing with about killing enemies and saving the country. In fact, this is not always the case. The difference between twilight and vigor cannot be judged solely by age. Today's decadent youth, who spend their days indulging in the theaters and dance halls, pursuing love and making sexual pursuits their second life, are truly shrouded in twilight and are even less worthy of discussing killing enemies and saving the country with. Zhang Zhongren's desire to form an army of old men, full of ambition, is like General Lian still able to eat heartily and Ma Fubo going out to sit in the saddle again. Although he has not truly formed an army, it is still an expression of being full of vigor. And what I have heard of the Hunanese Ren Fuli even sees Zhang as being more vigorous. Old people cannot be generalized. Fuli is seventy years old, a former Hanlin scholar of the Qing Dynasty, who once served as a censor. He is strong in character and known for his outspokenness. During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, he was angered by Japan's brutality and requested to go to the front lines, spending several days amidst the smoke and bullets. However, the Qing army eventually collapsed, and there was no way to save the situation. Soon after, he submitted a memorial opposing something, greatly offending Empress Dowager Cixi, and was dismissed and returned to his hometown. He often lamented that foreign insults came frequently and that national affairs were deteriorating. Who would have thought that Japan would become more and more oppressive, even more brutal than before, and would even occupy our three northeastern provinces with force for no reason? Upon hearing this news, Fuli cried bitterly and said, "I never imagined that in my dying years, I would again witness the fragmentation of our land." He also said to his son, "I am old and my death is not regrettable, but I am unwilling for my children to be slaves of a conquered nation, eking out a living in the hands of foreigners. I should fight the Japanese devils with all my might. If the government implements the recovery of our land by force, I will definitely change into military uniform and go to fight the enemy, even as a common soldier, I would be willing." But waiting for a long time, the government had no intention of sending troops and spent his days writing in the air in frustration, almost abandoning food and sleep. He then drafted a petition, strongly arguing that it was necessary to send troops. It was a voluminous work of ten thousand words, and he personally traveled to Beijing to present it to the authorities. His son tried his best to dissuade him and offered to submit it on behalf of his father, but he would not listen. Alas, how can such a person be said to be old and have a sense of twilight?</p>

<p>— Huang Ren</p>
<p>The Original Site of Adam's Paradise – Sussex County, England. Although it is often praised in articles and sung in poems by general literary figures and writers, no one dares to say that this beautiful county with its beautiful scenery is the original site of the Garden of Eden for Adam and Eve, the ancestors of mankind. This is what American research experts have researched with a lot of thought and believe to be certain. According to him, most of the prehistoric relics found in archaeological or scientific records are not real. Only Adam, the first real man, the ancestor of mankind, actually lived in Sussex County. According to his research, it was about 1.25 million years ago. At that time, the world had not yet been developed, and of course, there were thickets and thorns everywhere. And roaming among these thickets and thorns were completely ferocious and terrifying mammoths and tigers and leopards with teeth like blades. Adam dodged east and west to save his life, and it probably took a lot of effort, just like us modern people living in the city, busy dodging cars on the streets.</p>
<p>The King of Fresh Fruit Industry in England – Forty years ago, there was an eleven-year-old poor boy in England who asked his father for three pennies, not to buy snacks or candy, but to buy twelve bunches of primroses. That night he sold them on the street for one penny each, earning a total of nine pennies. He was so happy that he thought about how to make money on plants from then on. Once, he got a few pea seeds and planted them in his small garden. More than a year later, he got thousands of pea seedlings, which he sold all together. At the age of fourteen, he engaged in the fresh fruit industry. At the age of seventeen, he opened a large fresh fruit store in Eversham and actually started doing big business. By the age of nineteen, he was the general manager of a large fresh fruit company. He also got the title of "King of Gooseberries" (because gooseberries are a kind of fresh fruit). He could export 114 tons of gooseberries every day, breaking the record in the fresh fruit industry. Who is this person? It is the current Chairman and General Manager of the National Canned Food Company, Mr. S. Smedley, who has 3,000 employees under his command.</p>
<h3 id="e164">National Products Factories Worth Introducing (13) <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>(1) (2) Machine-Made Paper Box Factory</p>
<p>Paper boxes are necessary for packaging commercial goods. In Shanghai, there are more than a thousand machine-made paper box factories, because they require little capital, have large sales, and are easy to set up. The larger ones include Zhou Tongxing on Sanyang Road, Mao Taixiang on Lao Beimen, Wang Juxing and Wu Jinxing on Baoxing Road, and others in the Hongkou area. There were also several large Japanese factories in the past in areas such as Yalv Road. After our people resisted Japan, they closed down one after another.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of box factories depends on the business operations of the customers they attract. If they attract soap factories, sock factories, food factories, etc., then the development of the box factory can be expected. However, in recent times, large factories, aware of the outflow of profits, often manufacture their own, such as the Yonghe Family and other factories. Only Mao Taixiang and Lianxing currently produce boxes with printing.</p>
<p>Box-making machines include two types: paper-cutting machines and stringing machines. Paper-cutting machines vary depending on the type of paper being cut, so the cutting knives are also different. Stringing machines mark yellow cardboard with knife marks along the lines, making it easier to fold and paste. Each paper-cutting machine costs more than 30 yuan, and each stringing machine costs around 120 yuan. The Hexing Machine Factory on Qipu Road in Shanghai is the most famous manufacturer.</p>
<p>Box-making raw materials include yellow cardboard, cardboard, crepe paper, etc. Yellow cardboard is mostly domestic, such as Golden Bear brand, Phoenix brand, etc. Cardboard is a Western product. Crepe paper used to be a Japanese product, but recently it has mostly been replaced by American products, but the price is more expensive.</p>
<p>Each machine can produce about 2,000 soap and sock boxes per day. The expensive boxes can cost more than one yuan each, while the cheap ones cost only three yuan per thousand.</p>
<p>The situation is very different when it comes to manufacturing cigarette boxes. The factory can manufacture large paper cigarette boxes with 50 or 25 packs. As for small cigarette boxes with 10 sticks, not only are the machines and work procedures different, but also it is impossible to set up a factory without 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Records of Knocking on the Bell in an Old Temple (58)</p>
<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhaifu</p>
<p>Sixty-Five</p>
<p>The Annual Plan for Children in the Old Temple is the annual plan for every child in the Old Temple, and it can also be said to be the annual plan for all the children in the Old Temple. The matters listed in the plan are the matters that every child does. If every child implements the plan accordingly, then the sum of individual achievements will become the overall achievement.</p>
<p>The matters listed in the plan are the minimum limits. Children with greater abilities can do more things or do each thing more. In case the ability is not enough, even the minimum limit cannot be done, there should be a flexible solution after review.</p>
<p>This plan is a trial draft. Because it is the first time to set this plan, everyone does not have sufficient experience and it cannot be set very correctly. Some amounts may be set too high, and some amounts may be set too low. We can try it out while recording the shortcomings to revise this year's plan or reset next year's plan as a reference.</p>
<p>The plan is set for people: people are not born for the plan. If the plan does not work, or if it is forced to implement it is harmful to life, we can propose amendments. We would rather sacrifice the plan for the sake of the child, and never sacrifice the child for the sake of the plan. However, the plan is set by everyone, and amendments must be passed by everyone. If an individual feels that there are shortcomings in the plan, they can propose it to the public for discussion, and they must not act arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Daily life such as eating and sleeping does not need to be reminded every day, so it is not included in the plan. Things that need to be improved in daily life such as bathing, drinking soy milk, etc. are emphasized in the plan. Everyone cannot help but doubt drinking soy milk, right? I will tell you: "Milky white soy milk is better than ginseng soup: drink it into your stomach, it is refreshing and healthy." If you don't believe it, try it. When these new things become natural habits, we don't have to include them in the plan anymore.</p>
<p>One particularly important point in this plan is cooperation. You see that growing vegetables, planting trees, building roads, exterminating pests, teaching others to learn, and earning money to support the Northeast all use the power of the public to create public achievements. Although the achievement of one person is small, if accumulated, it will naturally be spectacular.</p>
<p>Since we set this plan, we have increasingly felt that schools and society must be integrated to generate great power. When we discussed it, we found that there were many things to do in the village, but primary school students could only do a part. Can that part of the thing be put aside? If it is put aside, even the lives of children cannot be healthy. I won't say anything else, just say one thing. The people of the Old Temple drink dirty water, and even this dirty water is not enough to drink. If we want every child to grow plump and wash clean, and hundreds of herbs and thousands of flowers to flourish like children, then we have to dig several large wells. Digging wells is the first major event in running a school, but the work of digging wells is definitely beyond the capabilities of children. There are many such things. We have already made up our minds not to let individuals escape the net of life education. Since the children's strength is not enough to do this kind of work, Mr. Zhu thought of the young farmers. Young farmers are going to turn the countryside into paradise and turn hell into paradise. You are leading the way in front of the children with this mission.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Gold Standard Lowered from High <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Breaking Through the 750 Taels Barrier. Yesterday, the 28th, the gold standard rose and fell, showing a slight consolidation. There was a total difference of six taels throughout the day. In the end, it fell by three taels. As the silver market declined, and the exchange rate between British and American currencies continued to decrease slightly, it opened high. Afterwards, fluctuations were frequent, and the various treasuries had different responses. However, the Cantonese brokers showed strong selling pressure, and the exchange rate was unstable, coupled with oversupply from the industry. The price of gold tended to weaken because of this, and deteriorated, eventually breaking through 750 taels. The outlook was still flat, without much change. Trading in the market was still not active, eventually settling at around 748 taels. The daily situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Initially Opened High. From the opening in the early morning of September, it immediately rose by one tael and four qian, calculated at 752 taels and eight qian. Large silver bars fell again by one-sixteenth to one-eighth, and American silver fell by one-quarter. However, bank private telegrams only indicated a small decrease of one-sixteenth. Especially because Yifeng, Yongfeng, Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Zhaofengchang and others first sold off, the price immediately depreciated by three taels, to 49 taels and eight lines. Soon after, Tongchun, Hengyu, Hengchangyong, Yifengyong, Futaiheng, and Tongtaichang showed strong buying interest. Furthermore, Huabi bought $30 of October American dollars, and the American Silver Company telegraphed to purchase $75 of near-term American dollars, so the price rose by two taels, to 51 taels and seven qian at slightly after 9:10. Unfortunately, Yifeng continued to sell, and retreated to 50 taels and a half. The first order was posted at 9:30 as before, but American dollar was squeezed small, and the exchange rate was posted small by .125, at 51 taels and three qian. It was then reduced by seven or eight qian. After 9:45, the buying side began to gain momentum. Hengchangyong, Hengxingyuan, and Tongdachang were seen covering short positions. Also, Tongchun, Yuankangxiang, Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, and items came to compete for purchases. Especially Huabi and Maixing absorbed $30 of October American dollars, and $125 of November American dollars, so the price returned high by three taels. However, the consolidation was only a few qian. By 10:30, it was 53 taels and four qian.</p>
<p>Strong Selling Pressure Led to Sharp Declines. After entering, it was in a state of fatigue. Mitsui released 0.0625 of October, and American and Japanese banks all came out, 0.0625 of $30 in October. HSBC released 0.875 of September, and because Yifeng sold off again and again, Ruixing, Fuyu, Hengyu, Yifengyong, Yuantai, Zhifengyong, Hongkangyong, etc., all took this opportunity to sell. As a result, the price fell by four taels and several qian. From 10:30 to 11:00, there was a fluctuation of one tael, turning to 48 taels and seven qian. In a blink of an eye, it raised more than one tael. Hengxing came in with three or four hundred bars, and items also bought. Also, Maixing and HSBC absorbed $30 in October to 0.0625. Huabi traded 0.75 of August, to 11:45, at 50 taels and a half. Because Fuyu, Zhifengyong, Hengchangyong, Hengxingyuan, Hongkangyong, and Yifeng, etc., showed strong selling pressure, it dropped three taels. At noon, it ended up at 47 taels and a half. Hengxing continued to enter, so the noon close was 48 taels and six qian, then added three or four qian, and items traded largely by four qian.</p>
<p>Evening Close Falls by 3.2 Taels. The market opened at 48 taels and nine qian in the afternoon. Hengyu and others bought in, for 49 taels and four qian. However, Ruixing released again, resulting in 48 taels. Mackellar came out, 0.9375 of September American dollars, and HSBC released 0.8125 of August. After entering, Zhifengyong, Hongkangyong, Yuanmaoyong, and retail short positions slightly covered, causing the price to jump two taels, to 50 taels and two qian at 3:30. Because British and American tobacco companies had settlements, Huabi released 1.81875 of near-term British gold, and 1.83125 of September. Again, due to the activity of selling positions, people's hearts turned downward, losing two taels again, to 48 taels. By the 4:00 closing, it was 48 taels and two qian, a further drop of three taels and two qian compared to the noon. Afterwards, it traded to around eight taels before and after. Yifengyong bought in. According to the day's maximum of 53 taels and four qian, and minimum of 47 taels and five qian, the difference was five taels and nine qian. Bare bars still added nine taels.</p>
<p>Posted Price Squeezed Six Taels. The posted price was changed to 817 taels. Because American dollar was posted small by .125, the calculation squeezed 66 or 67 taels, then 64 taels, then 70 taels at noon, 68 taels in the afternoon, then 67 taels. The result was 69 taels, six taels more than the previous day. Booked at 52 taels to 49 taels. Added water at 48 taels, and 47 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Different Entries and Exits for Each Firm. Trading on the floor was quite active. According to statistics, Yuanmaoyong, Hengxingyuan, Yiyu, Hengxing, Futaiheng, Taifengcheng, Tongchun, Yuankangxiang, Yuanxingyong, and Yuhe all entered. Tongtaichang bought more than a thousand bars to cover short positions. Hengchangyong also resisted entering by seven or eight hundred bars. Zhifengyong and Dadecheng entered and exited. Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanheng, and Hengyu had varying entries and exits. Ruixing, Yongfeng, Yifengyong, Yifeng, Yuantai, Fuyu, Hongkangyong, and Zhaofengchang all exited. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, Hengxingyuan, Hengxing, Hengchangyong, and Hongkangyong all exited. Yuanmaoyong entered first and then exited. Ruixing, Fuchang, and retail all exited. On this day, it was found that the Dalian brokers only accounted for three or four hundred bars. Cantonese brokers, such as Hengxing, bought in more than 800 bars. Yifeng</p>
<p>On the contrary, dumped more than 2,000 bars, and has already flipped to short positions. The foreign firm George &amp; Co. also sold off a little, it is said.</p>
<p>Gold Exchange Closed Next Monday. Because August 1st falls on a bank's routine holiday, the gold exchange will be closed for two consecutive days on July 31st (a Sunday) and the 1st. The market will not open until next Tuesday (2nd). This is announced in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Exchange Market: Sterling Weak, Dollar Stable <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market returned to normal. The exchange rate continued to fall by one cent. The HSBC posting in this port did not change for British gold, and the American dollar shrank by .125, calculated at 29 yuan and .375. Also, the French franc decreased slightly by one yuan. The German mark decreased by .25. The rest remained the same. Internally, it was also sterling weak and dollar stable. However, there was a slight consolidation throughout the day. It was weak in the morning, firm afterwards, relaxed at noon, and flat in the afternoon. The result was that British gold increased by .125 compared to the previous noon. The Vatican gold only increased by .0625. The exchange rate was squeezed small, so the gold market went from high to low, eventually breaking through 50 taels and falling 3.0 taels. As for foreign exchange transactions, they were quite active. Tens of thousands of pounds of British gold were transacted. British and American tobacco companies had some settlements. However, the various gold firms had quiet treasuries. Six or seven hundred thousand yuan of American dollars were transacted, with more selling than settling. Citibank had purchased July and August. However, the treasuries of various banks were bustling, and the market was not slow to consolidate. The transactions before and after the market are recorded below:</p>
<p>British Exchange. The domestic market throughout the day was no more than a .0625 difference. The selling price in the morning was 1 shilling, 8 pence, .125 to .25.

<h3 id="e167">Silver Bullion Telephoned Back Long <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>国民社 Telegram from London on the 28th, silver bullion suddenly turned long again. Closing price for the near term at 17 pence .125, up one-sixteenth from the previous day; the far term at 17 pence .1875, up one-eighth from the previous day. The London-to-New York exchange rate opened at $3.51625.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Lizi Market Desperately Weak <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Falling Through the 9-Fen Barrier</p>
<p>The Market Outlook is Increasingly Sluggish. The market situation this month was originally a quiet period. The ups and downs in the middle were nothing more than embellishments to the market scene. Now, due to the need for foreign funds, stagnation persisted. Although the demand for silver has increased compared to the past, the social regulation has still not been widespread. The protracted centralization is not a good strategy. Looking at the various stores in Shanghai, which rely on the turnover of the financial community, there are countless that cannot raise funds today. If you don't want the market to develop, that's fine, but if you want it to prosper, you must start with unimpeded flow and ensure that all sectors are not in shortage. Therefore, the increasingly sluggish situation at present starts from this cause. Yesterday, the market climate of both markets was increasingly fatigued, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Foreign Lizi Suddenly Falls, Silver Discount Remains Static. The "Foreign Lizi" price in the early market fell compared to the early market of the previous day, and was .025 taels higher than the previous noon, at six qian, nine fen, zero seven hao and a half. The noon market actually fell through the 9-fen barrier, to six qian, eight fen, nine li and a half. The result was a decrease of a little over 1 li compared to the previous morning. The "Silver Discount" in the early market was still one qian and five fen. The noon market remained as before, calculated at one qian and five fen. The bank's posting was six fen, with the interest rate plus water at one qian and sixty-seven fen. The silver market climate seemed to be slightly better than before, but the situation ultimately failed to extend to the activities of all businesses.</p>
<p>Guangjiao Plummeted by 2.5 Li. Jiangnan Xiaoyang was six qian and two li in the early market, down .005 li from the previous day. The noon market remained the same, again at six qian and two li, and transactions were also rare. 5,500 jiao in the early market, and 2,000 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong Xiaoyang, due to the fall in foreign lizi, also followed the downstream, but the two markets fell a total of 2.5 li, calculated at five qian, eight fen, six li, two hao and a half in the early market, and five qian, eight fen, five li in the noon market. Transactions were 85,000 jiao in the early market, and 45,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were slightly short, 1,000 wen for 427,000 wen, and transactions also had more than 47,800 strings, calculated at a cost of 11,200 taels of silver.</p>
<p>Silver Payments, Clearances, and Transactions are All Lackluster. Yesterday's bank payment and clearance situation was quite quiet. Chinese merchants' payment and clearance tickets amounted to 1.8 to 1.9 million. Foreign merchants' payment and clearance tickets amounted to 1.5 to 1.6 million. Various goods exchange tax and miscellaneous payments and clearances totaled 6.5 to 6.6 million. Pledge transactions amounted to 5 to 600,000. Telegraphic transfers amounted to 500,000. Special payments amounted to more than 1 million. 700,000 entering the warehouse, and 400,000 exiting the warehouse. Money shop transfer ticket transactions totaled 5.3 to 5.4 million. New transactions and noon market transactions totaled more than 1 million. Silver public bills received totaled more than 30 million, the interest rate payment totaled more than 4.4 million. Payments and clearances from various routes totaled 4 to 500,000, paying cash 2 to 300,000.</p>
<p>Foreign Fund Trading Shows Slackness. Foreign fund transactions in the market, calculated with exchange ticket payments totaled 590,000 in the early market, and 460,000 in the noon market.</p>
<p>Banknotes totaled 50,000 in the early market, and 30,000 in the noon market. Off-market banknotes totaled 110,000 in the early market, and 60,000 in the noon market. Check transactions totaled 55,000 in the early market, and 40,000 in the noon market, increased by .25 taels based on market price. Bank trading, early market inter-bank trading 550,000, noon market inter-bank trading 400,000. Foreign account payments and clearances between various banks totaled more than 1.9 million. Banknote entries and exits totaled more than 2.1 million. Money shop foreign public bill payments and clearances totaled more than 7.1 million. Foreign interest rate payments and clearances totaled more than 2.2 million. Foreign fund borrowing entries and exits totaled more than 1.7 million. Foreign pledge transactions totaled 4 to 500,000. Small money shop transactions totaled more than 50,000.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Securities and Bond Market Utterly Collapsed <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Prices are Weaker, Market Condition Clear</p>
<p>Today's Settlement Closure</p>
<p>Yesterday (28th), the trading situation of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, spot opening was steady, although many, entries and exits were still scarce, only opening at 31,500 yuan, of which 19 accounted for 21,000 yuan, the rest were only several thousand yuan. Futures for September have already started trading, but only Salt Tax traded more than 5,000 yuan, with no other transactions. Entries and exits of August futures increased slightly, but the two rounds only had 2.545 million yuan. Transactions of various bonds were mostly around 2 to 300,000 yuan, while 96 Customs Integrity, Six Rehabilitation, etc., were only tens of thousands of yuan. To speak of the trend of the prices of various bonds, the environment is dangerous, financial difficulties, the market's sentiment is as cold as before, investment buyers are very rare, and the price is also in oversupply, lower than before, calculated to have fallen by about half a yuan or so. Spot goods such as Unified Salt Tax and Customs Tax 19 Customs, etc., have seen large declines due to the lack of market in recent days. Also, today's stock exchange will be closed for one day to handle the July settlement.</p>

<p>(Report by American Eastern Bank)</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the New York stock market saw increasingly strong buying interest, and the market prices rose uniformly, with some rising more than 4 points. Public bonds and wheat prices were also good. Several types of government bonds have opened at the highest price of the year. However, stock market prices are still far from the highest price of the year, but if they progress at the recent rate of advancement, it will not be difficult to reach it in the shortest possible time. A total of 1.7 million shares were traded that day, which proves the increase in public speculative interest. Also, on Wednesday, the demand for high-priced stocks in the market was very strong, which shows that there are more and more powerful figures joining in. This is a very good phenomenon. The production of steel industry is still maintained at the original rate of 16%, but it is believed that it will definitely increase soon. Looking at the reserve fund prepared by United States Steel Corporation to pay dividends to preferred stock shareholders, it can be confirmed that the authorities have a solid grasp of business in the near future. According to the telegram from Pia Co., the recovery of stock prices in the near future is still flourishing, according to Maiyun. The attached Dow Jones Index is as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market situation is trending upward, and the situation is quite strong. After the development of large-scale demand, the bottom stock of each factory is emptied, so the factory's mentality is strong. In addition, the trend of American cotton is calm, the buyer's courage is getting stronger, and the pulling force is even stronger. Rongxinghao still buys in and adds weight when it falls. In addition, the rejection of goods is even more intense. The inspection of inferior seconds in the inland is extremely strict. Shanghai also has further actions. As a result, people's hearts are shaken, and the number of general speculative buyers increases, like bees swarming in. Therefore, the market trend is upward, but the buyer's sales are relatively sluggish, and the idea of selling is not yet exhausted. However, the current environment is good, and it is temporarily difficult to fall. It is expected that the price of marked yarn will be close to 158 taels in the near future, and 535 taels in the far future, it is said.</p>
<p>The recent yarn rose by 2.5 taels. Before the auction, the market opened because American cotton trended upward by 15 pounds, and there were strict rejection messages for inferior yarn. Buyers in the market were enthusiastic, and each month rose from 1.4.8 qian to 2.5 qian. The transaction statistics were 42,200 bales. It was found that Gengfeng bought 1,400 bales, Shenji 1,500 bales, Daji 750 bales, Senkang 650 bales, Yiyu 700 bales, Dachang 550 bales, and Heshen 550 bales. Rongxing bought in 1,750 bales, Yuanfeng 850 bales, Changfeng 850 bales, Zhenda 600 bales, Dafeng 650 bales, Tongfu 550 bales, and Lichang 500 bales. The closing price of the personnel standard is listed below.</p>

<p>The Sales of Spot Yarn are Slightly Weak. Spot yarn sales are flat. It is found that after a large number of purchases, there should be a pause. The daily statistics of all gangs buying totaled 550 bales. The market was up 5.5 qian in the morning, and fatigued 2.5 qian in the afternoon. The amount of each gang's purchases is listed below.</p>

<p>The real demand for cotton market has become more and more smooth recently. All factories have purchases, because cotton yarn sells a lot, so they buy raw materials. Therefore, people's hearts are trending high, and the cotton bottom stock is weak. The price of fire engine cotton is sold at 30 taels, and the trend of American cotton is consolidating. According to a part, they are deeply afraid that it will be difficult to see small in the previous month, and there is news of rising prices. Therefore, popularity is even stronger. Some people are looking at 33 taels outside for the auction of flowers in August, but the sages believe that the domestic climate is good, and the progress of new cotton crops is smooth, so they are selling short for the far months. The future still depends on American cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Resists Selling Short, Rises by Half a Tael. Zheng Biao's pre-market opening was due to the rise in American cotton, and there was a lack of buyers in the market. The sales of spot cotton on the previous day improved, and the number of people making up for the scattered shorts increased daily. Each month rose from 3.5 qian to 5.5 qian. The transaction statistics were 91,900 dan. It was found that Dufeng sold 3,400 dan, Xincheng 3,300 dan, Xinheng 2,600 dan, Dafeng 1,100 dan, and Changfeng 1,100 dan.

<p>British Cotton is Also Steadily Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially fatigued due to the smooth harvest situation, but was later firm due to buying from the industry and short covering. Futures rose 13 to 16 points, and spot goods rose 15 points. British cotton futures rose 2-3 points, and spot goods rose 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose 10 points. The Indian cotton market was firm. Pingguo'er and Aomula were unchanged, and Bailuoxi fell 0.25 Robi. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 27th).</p>

<p>The Market Opens at 15 Yuan</p>
<p>Hunan Province Yesterday, 17 shi and 5 dou of new Pudong japonica were loaded and purchased by Xinchang Rice Mill. The market opened at 15 yuan, but there were more than a dozen boats of old goods, and the urban and rural stores sold about 5 to 600 shi. The market situation was depressed. Changxi Beigeng and Sutong gangs had no honor or disgrace. The early rice and early crops opened one corner lower. Yang Dujian was affected by the smooth sales of foreign rice, and the price gradually increased.</p>
<p>Xinzha Yesterday, the rice market was still stable. There were not too many people coming to the market in the early morning. The top goods of Changxi Beigeng shouted up once, the middle level was weak, and the price was tired by one corner. Early and late rice and Yang Dujian arrived and sold sparsely, and the market also followed. The total number of riverbed feet was about 1,670 shi, and there were about eight or nine boats from the mainland.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Foreign Rice Sales are Still Good <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the digestion of foreign rice in this street was very good. Although there were no customer gangs to buy, the market has been able to stand. Because the inventory in the market is gradually decreasing, post-ordering is not cost-effective, and the report that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Xianggan rice price is as low as 2 yuan and several corners sent a letter to the rice industry purchasing department is not entirely consistent with the facts. It is found that this price of 2-3 yuan is the lowest price in areas with inconvenient transportation and suppression of bandits. If it is the rice price in a commercial port, the local price still needs 6-7 yuan. Adding freight, taxes, and all expenses, it is quite difficult to make a profit. In the bandit suppression area with inconvenient transportation, it is impossible to transport. Moreover, the new rice in various provinces only has a small amount of early rice, and the late rice will not be available for another two to three months. Therefore, people's hearts are still hopeful, and the prices of various rice have not changed. The total market opened 3,300 bags of small twist, priced at 9 yuan and 4.5 corners to 9 yuan and 3.3 corners. 500 bags of Saigon mid-level rice were priced at 10 yuan and 1.2 corners. 200 bags of Annam japonica were priced at 11 yuan and 8 corners. Except for 800 bags of small twist purchased by inland townships, all are income from local filling, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Flour Market Slightly Declines After Rising <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Manufacturers Had Large-Scale Sales Before Closing</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, each month saw a sign of flourishing again, because the quotation of foreign wheat was 6-7 corners better, which made the market more expensive. In addition, more people outside the industry were willing, and the purchase was very strong. Also, after the continuous rise of foreign wheat, the soaring of the market was inevitable. At the time of opening, each month was 1-2 points higher than the previous day, but at that time, larger manufacturers would have large-scale sales, so after the fourth round, the market of each month gradually became weak, but the buying was still very smooth, so there was little rise or fall in the end. Looking at the future, if foreign wheat does not rise again, the rise will not be too fierce. As a result, this month was .025 points better than the previous day, August was unchanged, October was 0.7 points better, November was .025 points better, and December was .05 points lower, it is said.</p>
<p>Also, News from Tianjin, the spot flour has risen by 0.3 points, with daily sales of 7-80,000 bags. Sales are brisk, and the market is seen as stable, it is said.</p>

<p>Spot and Futures Prices Up Significantly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market experienced a surge across all months after the morning opening. This was driven by a rise of six to seven jiao in foreign wheat prices. Mainland traders and local speculators were greatly affected by this surge, leading to extreme anxiety. They rushed to cover their positions, and some manufacturers reportedly also made purchases, boosting market activity. With the continuous rise in foreign wheat prices, mainland traders inevitably speculated on price increases. Therefore, the outlook for the market remains positive. As a result, the August contract rose by six fen compared to the previous day, September by seven fen, October by five fen, November by six fen, and December by seven fen. The spot wheat market is particularly prosperous due to the high standards. Premium quality wheat is priced at seven to eight fen higher. Zhenjiang wheat opened at 3.17 taels per picul, Bianjiang wheat at 3.04 taels, Huangbo wheat at 3 taels, Anting wheat at 3.07 taels, and Penglai wheat at 3.1 taels, down to 3.05 taels. Wusong wheat was at 3.04 taels. A total of 1,500 bags were purchased by Fuxin and Huafeng.</p>

<p>Trades Opened at a Brisk Pace for One Thousand Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market at the Sugar Trade Association saw lively trading due to good market sentiment. However, supply was scarce, leading to a gradual rise in prices. Dutch No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar traded at 14.55 taels, while high-quality bagged white sugar fetched 14.6 taels, up five fen from the previous day. The market remained firm. Raw brown sugar was stable at 12.3 taels. Taikoo sugar was relatively stable, with B mark at 16.25 taels, CW mark rising to 15.85 taels, DY mark remaining at 15.45 taels, HM mark at 14.9 taels, and H mark at 12.55 taels. The market outlook was positive. At the official trading session, Huaxin Company sold one thousand bags of coarse granulated white sugar, with brisk interest from buyers, and the entire lot was quickly sold at 14.55 taels per bag.</p>

<p>Silk sales have become increasingly sluggish as silk weaving factories both domestically and abroad are undergoing reduced production and shutdowns for summer vacation. There have been no developments in overseas silk telegrams reaching Shanghai, European and American clients alike are hoping to buy inventory at low prices. However, the local silk merchants agree that this spring's raw material harvest was poor and thin, so silk costs cannot be low or cheap. Silk sales from the silk stores have also calmed down. Yesterday, only Yongxing purchased 13 to 15 small cartloads of Sichuan yellow silk, totaling five packages, for a price of 390 taels. Samsung purchased ten packages of Jinqili white spun silk, totaling ten packages, for a price of 450 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, British firms Jardine Matheson and Jinlong, among others, actively sought to purchase large quantities of Wuyuan superior green tea, resulting in improved sales. However, most transactions involved breaking up bulk lots, leading to a seven-to-eight tael price reduction compared to previous levels. The market for "Luzhuang" and "Tuzhuang" Zhen Mei teas was also quite lively. However, abundant inventories and wavering market confidence made it difficult for prices to rebound. In contrast, Russian trading houses have been hesitant to purchase Gongxi green tea, and Baitou Zhuang has also been lowering prices, resulting in a very sluggish market.</p>

<h3 id="e182">To Resist or Not to Resist? <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspapers contained two pieces of news that were quite confusing, and I would like to bring them up as follows:</p>
<p>(1) According to a report from Tianjin, on the morning of the 27th, the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin sent four freight cars loaded with 100,000 sandbags, electrical grids, wireless radio equipment, and military pigeons to Yuguan via the Beining Railway. Furthermore, according to a telegram, the Japanese have recently been deploying military forces along the (puppet) Fengshan Railway with extreme secrecy.</p>
<p>(2) According to a Reuter's dispatch from Peiping on the 27th, the authorities here deny the rumors circulating in Shenyang and Shanghai that Zhang Xueliang's troops are advancing from Jehol and gathering on the Manchurian border. They claim that Zhang's troops have not moved, and these rumors are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>Currently, the Japanese are making very active preparations for aggressive actions, yet the Peiping authorities are desperately denying any movement. How pathetic and deplorable is this? However, according to a friend, Zhang Xueliang's attitude has recently undergone a major change. He keeps proclaiming that he will resist to the death. If that is the case, then why are the reports about Zhang's troops advancing towards Jehol being denied?</p>
<p>It seems that Little Zhang's strategy has indeed changed. In the past, his advocacy of non-resistance was widely condemned by the world. So now, he has undergone a complete transformation into a proponent of resistance. Fortunately, he can continue to resist in words while remaining inactive, and he will no longer be criticized by the world. But the world will again criticize him for remaining inactive despite advocating resistance. He can then mobilize his troops a little, or dig a few trenches, which can be considered a defensive effort. This can also be considered resistance.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are two types of resistance: resistance in words and form, and resistance in strength and spirit. I wonder which type of resistance Zhang is adopting? As the saying goes, "At first, when I judge a person, I listen to their words and trust their actions. Now, when I judge a person, I listen to their words and observe their actions." Because there are so many slippery characters these days, who are often insincere and make empty promises. Their words are unreliable. I need to open my eyes wide and see what they are really up to!</p>

<p>The waning moon and crumbling walls reflect on the riverbank, willows caress the morning breeze, reminiscent of where boats once moored.

<p>Science</p>
<h3 id="e185">Chromium <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Hong</p>
<p>Formula: Cr Molecular Weight: 52</p>
<p>Chromium is a bright, crystalline metal that remains unaffected at ordinary temperatures. It does not dissolve even in an oxyhydrogen flame, but turns into a liquid when exposed to an electric arc. This metal is also very difficult to analyze, requiring heating to about 3,000 degrees before it starts to dissolve. In high-temperature air, it burns brilliantly. It also has four valences: II, III, VI, and VII. If its valence is II, then it is a base former. If its valence is III, then it is a strong base former. If its valence is VI, then it is an acid former. If its valence is VII, then it is a strong acid former. Even strong oxidizing nitric acid and aqua regia do not cause significant changes or reactions. However, sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid can dissolve it, releasing hydrogen gas and leaving behind a chromium-containing salt.</p>
<p>Generally, alloys composed of highly reactive metals and those that are very resistant to corrosion often contain chromium. For example, when iron is mixed with chromium, it becomes a type of incredibly hard steel. Twelve to fourteen percent chromium, also known as stainless steel, is very hard and durable for making knives. The so-called stainless knives sold in the market are made of this.</p>
<p>When combined with nickel, it can be used to make steel helmets, armor, military uniforms, and shields that can withstand bullets. During the January 28th Incident, many brave soldiers of my 19th Route Army sacrificed their lives due to the lack of such protective equipment, while many Japanese soldiers survived because their helmets protected their heads. How tragic! The lack of scientific knowledge among the Chinese has reached this point. Alas, chromic oxide is used in paints and never fades. Chromic sulfide is excellent for tanning leather. The ancient method required eight months to tan a hide, but now it only takes four hours, and the results are several times better. Therefore, it has become an important material in modern industry and is also used as a mordant. Several acidic chromium compounds can also be used as pigments. As for the method of making chromium, there are three types:</p>
<p>1. Goldschmidt Process: Reduction of chromic oxide with aluminum.</p>
<p>2. Burning a mixture of charcoal and chromic oxide in a lime pot.</p>
<p>3. Reduction with zinc.</p>
<p>Chromium does not exist in nature in a pure state, but is contained in several compounds, such as FeOCr2O3. Its main production areas are in California and other places.</p>
<p>In short, chromium has long attracted the attention of the world (except China) and is of great help in warfare and industry. I hope readers will pay special attention so that I won't have wasted my time and effort in writing this.</p>

<h3 id="e186">A Discussion on Improving Gift-Giving Customs <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Yixing</p>
<p>The principle of "reciprocity" in gift-giving is essentially an expression of human sentiments. As the saying goes, "Human feelings are like accounts to be settled." Therefore, simplicity and avoiding extravagance and novelty were the norm. The customs seemed to be fixed. However, in recent times, social morals have declined, and human relationships have become cold. Consequently, gift-giving has also changed significantly, often emphasizing hypocrisy, leading to people being burdened by the obligations of human relationships. This is especially prevalent in official circles, where the practice has become deeply ingrained. When superiors encounter weddings, funerals, or birthdays, their subordinates and colleagues engage in lavish displays of flattery, going to extremes. It's not uncommon for them to offer hundreds or thousands of gold coins for birthdays. Those with limited finances scrape together what they can. This results in monthly salaries being insufficient to cover the cost of gift-giving, leading to rampant corruption!</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider the ordinary exchange of gifts among people. They are often based on a person's status and reputation, regardless of the depth of their relationship. If you are a person of influence, even casual acquaintances will give generous gifts, hoping to curry favor. Even local bullies and village leaders exploit this, constantly inventing occasions like "yangshou" or "yinshou" every year, using them as pretexts to collect gifts, silver, and goods. Those with more prestige can even engage in outright extortion, making considerable gains. Customs have reached this point, and the abuses are endless. People have long wanted to speak out. Now that this local supplement has established a Society Improvement Discussion Group, I would like to contribute this issue for discussion. I believe that the following improvements should be made to gift-giving customs:</p>
<p>(1) Regardless of the wedding, funeral, or celebratory occasion, the maximum amount of money given as a gift should not exceed two yuan.</p>
<p>(2) When giving gifts, they should be practical items, limited in quantity and not extravagant.</p>
<p>(3) In the case of a funeral, if one has already attended the service and personally paid respects, there is no need to send anything else. Paying personal respects is a far greater expression of sentiment than any material gift. If one still wishes to honor the deceased, they can spend a few cents to write a eulogy and hang it before the spirit tablet, which is also a fitting gesture.</p>
<p>(4) Celebrating birthdays is not necessary. However, to commemorate a milestone in life, one can have a celebration every ten or twenty years, gathering relatives and friends for a joyous occasion. But it is inappropriate to use this as an opportunity to receive gifts from others. If one has close relationships and wants to keep some mementos, they should be things that are worthy of remembrance and not extravagant.</p>
<p>(5) Other activities like "yinshou" and performing good deeds are meaningless gestures that can be ignored.</p>
<p>These are the improvements I envision. However, the best fundamental solution is to eliminate the element of money from gift-giving. But due to deeply ingrained customs, a sudden change is impossible. Therefore, these are the transitional improvements. I welcome the wise to offer their corrections.</p>
<p>A Corner for the Society</p>
<h3 id="e187">A Stroll Down the Alley <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Geng</p>
<p>On summer nights, the cage-like houses are unbearably hot, and the pesky mosquitoes swarm around, buzzing and launching fierce attacks. So, one has no choice but to escape from the confines and head to the streets and alleys to enjoy a bit of the breeze and find relief from the sweltering heat.</p>
<p>This is a narrow alley, dimly lit by a few lifeless electric lights. Spiderwebs cover the lampshades, and the light bulbs have turned yellow. Patches of plaster have peeled off the walls, and green moss grows at the base. The foul-smelling gutters run the length of the alley. However, the stagnant wastewater is filled with tiny, wriggling mosquito larvae. All of this paints a vivid picture of this dim alley.</p>
<p>People are lying on the ground in clusters, some chatting, some gambling, and some already fast asleep. "A horse leaves the Western Liang border..." A friend, who is a laborer, lies on the ground, swinging his legs and singing. Across from him, a group of people crouch on a mat, gambling with dominoes.</p>
<p>"Xi Li Hua La!" With a shuffle of the tiles, the dealer throws back his neck and sings, "Seven pairs, Heaven's Gate first touch, Dealer's third touch."</p>
<p>After shouting this, four or five people reach out with their rough hands to grab their hands.</p>
<p>"Oh, broken! Broken!... Alas, damn it, no luck!" The man at Heaven's Gate stacks his two dominoes together, slowly opens them, and sighs.</p>
<p>"Hey, Ah Wu, what's up?" asks the person on the left.</p>
<p>"Damn it, Bie Shi!" says the Heaven's Gate player. One hand ends, and the dealer wins from two players and pays out to one. After a moment, the gambling continues. "Hey, Monk, what's up?" Ah Wu asks the person on the right.</p>
<p>"Not good, three-way Monk knocking on a wooden fish," the Monk replies.</p>
<p>"Haha, Monk meets Monk, what a coincidence," the dealer says, laughing.</p>
<p>"Hey, Hey, Three-Head and Ah San are coming!" A child runs in from the alley entrance, saying urgently. Immediately, the gambling group descends into chaos, hurriedly putting their money in their pockets and hiding their dominoes under the mat. One by one, they pretend to be calmly chatting. A foreign patrolman and an Indian policeman walk into the alley, slowly strolling and looking at the people on both sides.</p>
<p>"Jia deli ma deli gambling copper money, go inside!" the Indian policeman says to the group with a smile.</p>
<p>"Ah San, we aren't gambling copper money," the Monk says to him with a cheeky grin.</p>
<p>After the patrolman leaves, they take out their gambling tools again and huddle together to gamble. The sounds of Bie Shi, Zhi Zun, Tian Gang, and Di Gang fill the corner of the alley in a cacophony. At the end of the alley, two old women are talking.</p>
<p>"Granny San, the weather is very hot today!" one old woman says with a Ningbo accent.</p>
<p>"Not wrong, Zhang Old Lady, the weather is terribly hot," another says with a Suzhou dialect.</p>
<p>"Granny San, you are very lucky. You have three sons, all of whom can earn money. Your eldest daughter-in-law is capable, your second daughter-in-law is filial, and your third daughter-in-law is beautiful. You truly have it good, you've earned it in your past life," Zhang Old Lady says with envy.</p>
<p>"Oh my, you say that, but there are always troubles to be found."</p>
<p>"Smack!" Zhang Old Lady slaps her arm and curses, "Damn it, unlucky mosquitoes, so annoying!" After cursing, she continues chatting with Granny San. In the quiet air, I can only hear their soft conversations, common phrases like "True Emperor," "Jade Emperor," and "Early grandchild," piercing my eardrums. Occasionally, I also hear Zhang Old Lady's mosquito slapping sounds and her cursing, "Damn it!"</p>

<h3 id="e188">Lovable Shanghai? <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>"Ah! Shanghai, lovable Shanghai!"</p>
<p>A motorboat flies across the water like an arrow. Vaguely, a group of urban men and women sing this melodious song like a nightingale flying into my ears.</p>
<p>Standing beneath a tall building, I am deeply moved. Whether Shanghai is lovable can only be determined by those who have lived in Shanghai for at least three months. They will know that it is a prostitute suffering from a virulent sexually transmitted disease. Although it is alluring on the surface.</p>
<p>According to the Water Patrol Police Department, more than ten floating corpses were recovered from the Huangpu River last week. Upon closer examination, the reasons for these suicides were primarily</p>
<p>(1) Economic oppression</p>
<p>(2) Rejection in love</p>
<p>Other reasons were rare.</p>
<p>Shanghai has tall buildings, night gardens, dance halls... For those who indulge in pleasure and live in a drunken dream, it is, of course, a lovable place. However, in our large nation with its underdeveloped production and lack of widespread education, it is already a great fortune for people to be able to work from morning till night and still have enough to eat. Since the Shanghai Battle, many more friends have been unemployed. Economic oppression completes their suicide attempts in the Huangpu River. This is only a passive type of person. The more active initially try their luck through gambling; then they fall to become thugs. Thus, Shanghai has become a den of bandits where one's life is in danger when going out.</p>
<p>A bad environment can change people's personalities. Women are inherently prone to vanity (according to physiologists). Thus, love problems in Shanghai have become transactions of sex, and the parties involved are wearing tinted glasses, unaware of how to extricate themselves. Because the Shanghai they see is this kind of Shanghai. Furthermore, many frivolous films and novels clearly show that love is merely a check,</p>
<p>"A dull life!" Generally, young people shout loudly, finally they write a few sensual poems then go to the Huangpu River. Today, the newspapers reported a news item about bestiality in this city. It involved an oppressed eleven-year-old girl. This inhuman behavior was discovered in broad daylight, showing that Shanghai has no land(?), or national and personal standards.</p>
<p>Wealthy patrons who have enjoyed everything Shanghai has to offer have not seen this novel performance. Spending six yuan doesn't bother them. Harming the life of a young girl is even less of a concern to them. Chen Xinzhai spent money to buy a girl, of course, to sell her at a high price in the curious and corrupt minds of Shanghainese. How does the miss who sings "Ah! Shanghai, lovable Shanghai!" feel about this bizarre drama of bestiality?</p>
<p>Ah! Shanghai, lovable Shanghai?</p>

<h3 id="e189">Women "Out" and Men "In" <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Shou</p>
<p>The times are changing like an illusion, and everything is relentlessly passing. Ancient maxims once considered the gold standard are being overturned one by one. People are also being anesthetized and immersed by the times, forgetting the reasons why. As time passes, they feel that the present is right and the past is wrong. It's no wonder several senior gentlemen sigh deeply.</p>
<p>Opening the "Instructions for the Women's Quarters," one can't help but laugh. Why? It's the times. But what exactly is civilization? No one can say. Civilization is a vague thing? Perhaps what is considered a tremendous act of civilization now will be laughed at by more civilized people thousands of years from now.</p>
<p>In the past, there was an old saying, "Men should be out and women should be in." What does this mean? It means that men should be outward-looking, and women should stay at home, secluded and rarely venturing out. Just taking clothes as an example, women used to wear skirts that covered their toes when going out, and they didn't easily show their delicate hands to others. If a woman ran around in the streets, it was simply ridiculous. The times are different! Women bare their arms, legs, and chests, liberating themselves to the extreme. A portion of the women run around outside all day, calling it socializing, but men still wear long robes and pants. Except for the head that must breathe and the two hands that must work, the rest is completely wrapped in clothing. This phenomenon is now uniform both domestically and abroad. You see, foreigners always dress stiffly for ordinary days or banquets, while women show more and more skin. This is the reality.</p>
<p>I really don't understand why men are so stupid and don't know how to liberate themselves. I strongly agree with Mr. Zhang Cangsu's suggestion for improving men's clothing published in this newspaper. I hope it will be even more liberated, so that we men can also be "out."</p>
