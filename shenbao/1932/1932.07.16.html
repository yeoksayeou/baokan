<h3 id="c1">東北義勇軍毅庵 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>槍中一粒彈。必贯諸國仇。身上一滴血。必報諸祖國。是好男兒。是大丈夫。是游俠子。孰不當如是。然始終如是者。我不能不詠謌讚歎東北之義勇軍。</p>
<p>九一八事起。建牙擁　手綰兵符。平日食東北之利。挾東北爲重者。率其三十萬大兵。委而棄之若敝屣。誠足以羞志士之顏。而奪民族之氣。我東北已淪喪十閱月矣。今尚能使野心之日人。若坐針　。其軍警疲於奔命。死亡載道。是誰之力乎。稱王稱公沐猴而冠之僞組織。至今尚不敢自豪於　室之内。汲汲焉若不克自保其首領。是誰之力乎。使我東北亡而不亡。今日尚存一線生機。國人猶得牽挽維繫者又誰之力乎。非義勇軍苦鬥數月之力乎。嗚呼東北當局棄之。民衆保之。食其利者棄之。服其役者保之。負責任擁武力。者棄之臨時結合揭竿荷　者保之。我言東北。我不知涕之何從也。</p>
<p>勇莫勇於義勇。軍危亦莫危於義勇軍。拚萬死以桿國土。短槍快馬。神出鬼没。不惜以血肉之軀。與大砲坦克飛機鐵甲車敵。悲壯激烈。爲世罕見。優生學家潘光旦先生。謂中國民族。以東北爲最强。其言騐矣。然而内無接濟。外無援應。枵腹而作。裏瘡而鬥。軍食彈械醫藥物品等。作戰所需無　具。我中央及各省。曾無一成一旅之援。孤懸絶地。有血無鐵。數十萬健兒。舉其頭顱肝腦。爲祖國爭一息之命。碧血塗白山。丹心照黑水。忠義可以激士心。而不能果士腹。勇氣可以破敵胆。而不能抵敵彈。使全國社會人士。仍坐視而不爲之助。支持復支持。苦鬥又苦鬥。食盡兮彈絶。傷重兮力竭。行見此數十萬拚死捍國之英雄好漢。一一駢首陳屍於敵人之手。將來僅留亡國史上沉痛壯烈之一頁。「不見年年遼海上。文章何處哭秋風。」我書至此。我心碎。我手顫矣。</p>
<p>東北亡而全國將隨之亡。義勇軍盡。而我國民族將與俱盡。我地有限。敵慾無厭。不見夫錦州被佔。呑盡東北。而滬難遽作乎。不見夫東北義勇軍奮起抗敵。而敵師遽撤。滬難暫戢乎。不見夫義勇軍勢力稍絀。而平津又傳警訊乎。東北義勇軍。不徒使敵人不能安然唾手而攫東北。關内及沿海各地。晏然不爲敵擾者。何莫非拜義勇軍牽制敵人之賜。奈何我國人視義勇軍。若秦人視越人肥瘠。漠不爲意。而僅少數中之極少數。爲之呼號奔走。履霜堅冰。唇亡齒寒我國之存與亡。我民族之生與死。胥視國人之能援助東北義勇軍與否爲斷。</p>

<p>日本以僞國參加爲條件</p>
<p>以不可能事刁難各友邦</p>
<p>華聯社十五日大阪電　據今晚之朝日新聞所載消息、國聯調查團與荒木及内田會商結果、日方直言不諱、知其爲遼案引誘遠東戰爭、是日本所樂爲之事、所以向來研究之遼案、均受日本反對、而力倡召開國際會議解决中日之紛爭、而日本對此提案、附條件承認之、其所附之條件爲國際會議開會、滿洲僞國須爲參加國之一、此條件如得關係國承認、日本終不反對國際會議、而調查團若承認日本之要求、則自破九國公約、因此九國公約簽字國恐不贊成、如蔑視九國公約則國際會議參加國以何種原則、可以使各國贊成、此萬不可能之事、日本刁難之結果、自曝露其野心於全世界耳、</p>
<p>路透十五日倫敦電　日外相内田與國聯調查團最後一次談話中、曾有日本一旦承認「滿洲國、」即將拒絶與中國或國聯談判關於新國事件等語、今日大不列顚各報皆廣載之、且已引起一種討論、謂國際外交家大團體近在國聯大會會議中發抒偉見後、究竟已否移動與打敗日本之策略乎、倫敦政界現尚未有何評論、惟路透電社徵集各負責者之意見、一致以爲任何國在滿洲表明確已有永遠穩固之政府以前而承認「滿洲國、」則必受破壞九國公約之責難、故咸覺雖日本終必承認「滿洲國、」然必出以謹愼、未必甘冒天下之大不韙、而有引起不愉快之國際糾紛之危險云</p>
<p>荒木陸相斷言不撤駐滿軍</p>
<p>竟謂滿洲是日本第一道防綫</p>
<p>華聯社　據九日之大阪每日新聞所載、九日上午十時國聯調查團往訪荒木陸相時、提出質問三項、（一）滿洲與日本之國防有何種關係、（二）維持滿蒙治案之方針如何、（三）滿洲僞國之將來如何、日本軍部將採之政策如何、荒木答之如次、（一）自明治新政以來、經中日日俄之戰所結之因緣、滿洲爲日本國防之第一道防綫、（二）根據上條理由、維持滿洲之治安、於日本國防上自衛上有絶對需要日本爲此種義務、不惜任何之犠牲、今次之事變、亦爲中國在東三省之政府數年來採排日政策、侵害權益、於日本治安一有碍、日本遂以武力維持日本之主張、日本絶對不能由東三省撤退其軍隊、（三）滿洲國上三千萬民衆之總意所造成之國家、（日人一手朦蔽全世界之耳目、義軍到處蜂起、抗議其陰謀、日軍部依然無恥自不能省、反强說荒謬言論）、欲建設内外央民之樂土、此宣言與日本國防政策相符合、日本不惜傾全國之力、援助其發展、不承認滿洲國而由内外妨害滿洲國之發達、者日本政府欲以武力除之云云、</p>

<p>十九路軍抵閩後、尚待整個勦匪計劃决定、故暫未向閩西汀連推進、而粤軍第三軍長李揚敬、上月赴廣州至今日未防綫、故駐閩邊各師旅、亦停驂不前、因此共匪乃得從容進退、上杭永定兩縣、兵在附城、匪則紥鄕下山中、同處一隅亦殊可異、現粤軍黄任寰師駐武平蕉嶺、注重贛南方面、黄延禎黄質文兩師、亦在贛邊警戒、又第八師副師長歐陽新全團、七月一日進駐興寗縣城、未向閩贛進、又據贛邊消息、紅匪密集安遠潯鄔、羅塘至安遠爲匪第一防綫、筠門嶺爲匪第二防綫、瑞金附近爲第三防綫、築有新式壕壘、各砲台地穴有隧道相通、平時强迫人民做種種防禦工事、勸民衆掘地窖避飛機、又有無綫電臺、指揮五區軍事、作長據抗戰意、匪最注重粤方、認粤邊爲前方、廣信撫州爲後方、彼等並不重視南昌方面、故將來勦匪大戰、地點當在閩粤贛交界之處也、（六日）</p>

<h3 id="c127">馬寅初論廢兩改元问題 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>我國貨幣制度之不統一、早已成爲社會經濟一極大問題、改革之議、倡之已久、徒因銀本位制、尚紊亂而無統系、如内地商民、通行銀元、各大商埠、則以銀兩爲尚、旣非洋本位、又非銀兩本位、非驢非馬、深堪浩嘆、考一國法定貨幣、須經法律規定、而我國之銀兩、則不然、平色龐雜、就地劃分、滬用規元·津用行化·平用公　·就機關而言、則財政部用庫平·海關用關平·凡茲數、者皆爲銀兩、足舉爲國幣統一之障碍、而其最有力者、則爲規元、苟能一鼓而將規元殲滅、則其餘當無問題</p>
<p>此次改元之動機、事有凑巧、一方鑒於歷來幣之太紛亂、一方鑒於洋厘暴跌、最低時間六錢八分之新紀錄、洋厘所以暴跌这原因、不外以下六因（一）農村經濟崩潰、（二）都市資金集中、（三）金融季節失常（四）城市工商衰落、（五）現金鉅額貯藏、（六）内地匪禍頻仍、洋厘市價、旣一再跌落、於是握有成色較高之銀元者、不如溶之爲銀、似爲有益、因當作銀元計値、反不合算、所以近日爐房大忙特忙、每日有溶解銀元四十萬至五十萬之多、剩餘未溶者、多爲次等銀元、其成色反有劃一可能、大有造於銀元成色之統一、考銀元之種類繁多、其流通市面者、如墨西哥之　洋·大淸·江南·北洋·孫中山·袁世凱·尚有波斯洋·香港洋·等、其間之成色優劣不等、今如廢再改元、幣制統一、以前之銀幣、本當予以嚴格之規定、今能溶去其一部分雜色銀元、反可漸趨一致、現在所用之銀元、係製自杭廠、其出品成色、與法定符合、但於重量方面、每大洋十萬元、有四十元之差耳、將來廢兩爲元、辦法實行、新幣法價確定、則銀元預備在上海開鑄、因京廠廠址已燬、杭廠範圍較小、而滬廠機械能力、日可出大洋五十萬元、（年可出一萬八千餘萬元、）且有鑄造輔幣機器、如銀角銅元等、均可由滬廠一手經營、將來新幣成色、爲百分之八十九重庫平七錢二分、故每元純銀爲六錢四分另八毫、加上鑄費六厘、合庫平六錢四分六厘八毫、銀元之法定價格旣定、加以銀兩取消、將來不再有洋厘名目、人心可以安定、社會金融、得以穩固多多矣、</p>
<p>現此策之實行、惟一困難焦點、在乎有利害關係者之態度、反對者所持理由如、下（一）恐政府從中謀利、政府因握有鼓鑄銀元之權、並規定銀元法定價格、於是在開鑄銀元時、故意將成色减低、其與法定色所低之差、卽爲政府之利、（二）社會將受紙幣增多之患、一旦銀兩廢止、市上現洋籌碼、頓形不敷、於是可乘機濫發紙幣、於銀行大有陴益、否則籌碼則感簻乏、社會現象、顯見不佳、（三）軟硬幣統一之後、纔可廢止銀兩、今日</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>銀行大多數發行紙幣、以致市上紙幣數量紊亂、硬幣質量、旣已紊亂、軟幣又如此、故廢兩爲元、茲事體大、似尚　之過早、查上述三點、似是實非、政府如欲謀利、固不待廢兩改元後、在以　杭廠製造銀元時亦可、而政府在此時、　未　出此、故此點不攻自破、且銀元在出廠時、必須經公開化騐方可、况將來滬廠成立後、在商界實業界監督之下、開爐製造决無問題、亦方政治勢力、决不致波及也、故不如乘此洋厘下落、銀元價格下沉、多被溶化之際、奮力廢除銀兩、否則、固亦無法制止銀元之繼被溶化、如銀兩廢除、則社會上祇用洋、不再用銀、銀元化銀之目的消失、固不必取締、而自然停止矣、</p>
<p>反對者、不顧大局、惟恐將來利益問題、日趨减少、目視銀行前途、環境轉佳、心有不甘、爲私利所衝動、所以表示反對態度、以圖轉　、而我人以第三者地位觀察、此舉於銀行容或有利、但須知廢兩改元之惟一目的、非爲銀行、而爲大衆、故應以國家利益爲前提、似不應横加反對、</p>
<p>在錢莊方面論之、利益當然喪失、因上海各錢莊有現賬、而無洋賬、例如存户以洋元來存、彼照（市價减一二五（一毫二忽五）或二五折成銀兩、因洋元無利息、故存户亦願折合銀兩、以銀兩有拆息故也、）至提取時、則照市價提高合算、出入之間、卽得利益、若銀兩廢　、則錢莊不復能得此項利益、宜其反對也、但此尚非大故、今有更甚於此者、卽存放同業之制、勢將不行、蓋上海雖然銀行林立、類皆資本充足、信用素孚、但勢力不如錢莊遠甚、卽平日之收支各欵、如與錢莊有關係者、非委託錢莊代理不可、蓋錢莊有匯劃總會·以爲交換票之所、而銀行不得加入也、於是銀行之欵、存放於錢莊者、爲數多則千餘萬、少則五六百萬、因欲委託錢莊代理收付、非先存放不可、此謂之同業存放、如今實行　兩改元、則錢莊之惟一利器銀兩、頓被打倒、市上一律均用錢元銀元、爲銀行所富有、於是一切交易、銀行均可獨自任之、固不必受制於錢莊矣、錢莊之受銀行存欵當然取消、所以同業存放、無形中因廢兩改元問題、而壽終正寢、一旦銀兩廢去、則洋元之用途大廣、於是銀行收解欵項日繁、非籌設銀行票據交換所、不足以淸理一切、蓋票據交換所成立之後、銀行相互間之欠人與人欠兩項、可以　錢莊軋公單之方法、兩相抵冲現　之用途减少、搬運之麻煩可去、旣可省手續、又免擔風險、銀行從此可以致全力於營業矣、况在市面恐慌·或金融緊急之際、現金之需要驟增、銀拆飛漲、借貨停頓、苟有交換所以爲調劑、各行間可以改用公單、用現洋淸理其存欠也、因此錢莊之勢力更形减小、故歸納言之、此廢兩改元之後、錢莊受到三種影響、（一）一毫地忽半之利益無着、（二）同業存放取消、（三）銀行票據交換所成立、今年春間上海各銀行設立之銀行聯合準備庫、卽爲將來成立票據交換所之基礎、所發行之公單公庫證抵押證等、卽爲各銀行間謀便利而設、故日票據交換所之雛形已成、亦無不可、但錢莊之勢力、亦不致立卽完全消失、錢莊所出信用素著之莊票、固仍能行使於市上、因莊票有五天期七天期十天期者、商人有幾天之利息、當然樂用至於零星數目、則可用鈔票矣、但錢莊素所利用之匯劃銀與劃頭銀、則因廢兩改元問題實行、勢必取消、因銀兩二字、在廢兩後、根本不成立、考匯劃與錢莊有莫大之利、因匯劃銀卽須過一天付現、於是錢莊可從事取得一天之息、如數目大宗、以一年三百六十六天計之、卽等於一年之息、其利可觀、此無怪錢莊之極力爭執銀兩之存在也、至於錢莊反對理由中所云之銀兩、一旦廢除、則籌碼將感缺乏、如銀洋並用、則銀少洋代、洋少銀代、可以調劑、廢除銀兩後則不成、此語初聆之、似實有理、但仔細考察、毫無意識、蓋銀兩廢後、二者之力併而爲一、豈非一而二二而一、其效率固一、仍如舊也、　如有水兩小碗、甲碗水少、固可以乙碗之水補充之、反之乙碗水少時、可以甲碗之水補充之、此固言之成理、但吾人亦可將兩小碗之水併爲一大碗、水量絲毫不减、於應用上祇有便利毫無困難、至於紙幣、亦不致多發、因發行紙幣、現政府限制　嚴、須七成現金三成保證準備、始可易　十成鈔票發行額、且上海一埠、洋多銀少、上　現有大洋二　二千萬元、銀兩五千萬兩、旣然　洋、更不必多　鈔票、故銀兩廢止影響紙幣流通、並不甚　、錢莊又云、廢兩改元、須在軟幣統一之後、此語　不合邏輯、孰先孰後、誰能下此斷語、錢莊言此、似太無聊矣、蓋今日廢銀用元之目的、卽在統一硬幣、斷無銀兩不廢而硬幣能統一之理、</p>

<h3 id="c182">吳儂軟語的考證—抖怯縐 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>吳儂軟語，向來没有專書，有許多爛熟的話，說是人人會說的。寫的寫是人人不會寫的。爲什麽不會寫？只爲音的變遷。以訛傳訛。遂致失了眞義。</p>
<p>我很想把吳語整理一下子。雖有一部分的草創規模，但是距着成功，尚遠。我先提起三個字，是吳儂口中常常說的：（一）第一個字寫不出，只好寫個切音，便是「德矮」字。蘇州人口中，形容這個人大有媚意，便喚他一一聲「德矮」。</p>
<p>（二）第二個字寫不正，普通的蘇白書信，往往寫做邱字。身體不好，呌做身體邱，貨色不好，呌做貨色邱，脾氣不好的人，呌做邱人。</p>
<p>（三）第三個字，也是隨隨便便寫的，往往寫作鄒字。鄒字和邱字，意思差不多，但也有個分别：邱字代表不强健，鄒字代表不平直。</p>
<p>據我鄙，見以上的三個字，並不是難寫的字，從流溯源，大概是這麽三個字：</p>
<p>（一）「德矮」字，本來是個抖字。凡是說幾句媚人的話、聲浪愈抖、愈博人歡所；以取歡於人，吳語喚做抖字，一聽得聲浪顫動的昵語，便道：抖得來—抖得來！這個抖字，本是當口切，後來以訛傳訛，讀作矮切，又讀作德矮切；當德二字是雙聲；所以，把這個抖字，喚做「德矮」二字合音了。</p>
<p>（二）邱字，該寫做怯字；體質不强健，呌做身體怯；意志不强健，呌做脾氣怯。怯是「去劫切」，邱是「去鳩切」，怯和邱是雙聲，俗語的訛讀，都是雙聲的關係；所以，把這個怯字，又喚做邱字了。</p>
<p>（三）鄒字，該寫做縐字；縐是不平直的意思，皮膚不平直，呌做縐皮膚；脾氣不平直，呌做縐脾氣。縐定是仄聲，鄒字是平聲；蘇州人口中的四聲，本來隨隨便便的；把仄聲的縐字，讀作平聲的鄒字，這是無怪其然了。</p>

<p>— 汪精衛</p>
<p>樹人先生以畫集索序於余。余與樹人共事久。治事之暇。或論及於詩。且時時得觀樹人所爲畫。余不解　學。於詩所得亦至淺溥。余嘗自序其所爲詩曰。</p>
<p>詩云。民亦勞止。汔可小休。旨哉斯言。人生不能勞。勞不能無息。長勞而暫息。人行所宜然。亦人生之至樂也。而余詩卽成於此時。故余詩非能如禹鼎之象姦。溫犀之照怪。窮盡萬物之情。而無所遁也。特如樵夫負販。烈日行長道中。偶弛擔就樹下不憇。相與箕居歌吟笑呼。以忘痛苦於須臾耳。因卽以小休名吾集云。</p>
<p>夫余之於詩。固已治之二十餘年。而所得之淺薄尚如此。况於畫夙所不解。更何足以爲樹人序乎。顧樹人與余同致力於革命。者以勞苦爲生平。以犠牲爲究竟。誠非有所樂而爲之。特良心之督責有以使之不得不然。而所得之慰安。亦陮有良心之愉快。對於人間享樂。取之少過。不惟傷廉。直將陷於罪戻。微論物欲。卽所謂天然之美。似於人無所偏私。然頽　矮屋之下。炭坑遂道之内。則風日無私之說。亦　然有以其不然也。然吾人旣不能無勞。勞旣不能無息。則於長勞暫息之際。所得取以爲慰藉者。天然之美較爲無罪。天地萬物之現象崇尚而平易。深沉而坦白。純一而多變化。與吾人無垢之良心合而無間。范希文有言。不以物喜。然當此之際。已不知我之爲物物之爲我。天地萬物之間。有慈悲而無嗔厭。有良善而無罪惡。嬉戯自若。虞詐不生。此一刹那之慰藉。足以忘百年之勞苦而有餘。情動於中。發之而爲歌吟。形之而爲圖畫。有不期然而然者。蓋不欲此刹那之瞥然而逝。而謀有以流連嚮往於無窮也。質之樹人以爲何如。</p>

<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>戈公振氏新自東南旋。談及東北敎育。備極慘痛。茲記概要於次。戈氏謂佛敎認智識爲魔障。信夫。東北之智識階級。尤以敎育界爲最。其慘痛不勝言。苟世界果有地獄。則東北爲人間地獄矣。而敎育界人士。當在地獄中最下層者。彼輩日在死不得活不得中討生活。上天無路。入地無門。顚沛流離。精神上所受之刺戟。往往令人狂易。大學生不久義勇軍。即亡命出奔。無辜遭戮者相枕藉也。馮庸大學傳改滿州大學。確係事實。不久將見實行。中等學校現均停閉。蓋恐學生聚首一堂。易激風潮。瀋陽城外一工業中學。曾一度預備開學。孰知開學前一日。校内各室滿貼「打倒日本」「寗爲中國鬼不作僞國奴」等標語。各敎師睹此情狀。溫言勸令學生忍耐。毌因小不忍而亂大謀。開學上課之舉。因是中輟。中學方面之敎科書。以時間局促。不及另編。乃將舊日各敎科書改頭換面。遇有「中華民國」字樣者。僉改作滿州國。不利於日本之文字。當然一一删除。至小學方面。則大多開學。小學生年幼識淺。無抗日能力。日遂利用其可塑性。加意陶鑄。敎育部頒布之課程標準。全部推翻。所有功課。僅存五種。國文·修身·歷史·地理·數學是也。敎科書盡數新編。咸以建設滿洲國反抗中國爲主旨。敎師雖屬華人。而時有日人到校。監督干涉。各敎師以種種苦衷。含淚執敎。最近有「滿洲國建國運動。」强令小學生參加。唱滿州國國歌。向交叉之滿州國旗及日本國旗行禮。不服命之小學生。其家庭輒受蹂躪。今日東北敎育。由敎育部管理。部長即鄭孝胥。一承日本意旨。現日人聘用在朝鮮辦學有經騐之日本敎育當局。赴東北執掌敎育文化。彼等計劃擬以朝鮮之方法施諸東北。嗚呼。誰爲爲之。孰令致之。而至於此耶。</p>

<p>疇昔之午。兩客自金山來。一姓徐。奉賢人也。一姓潘。洙涇人也。係特來參觀禾豐農林塲者。徐君携有鳥籠一。籠中之鳥。八哥是也。方入　門。懸籠於葡萄架。少頃。八哥忽作鵲鳴鷄啼等聲。繼而又作人語曰。「八哥八哥·八哥吃肉。」音若幼童。淸潤動耳。徐君曰。是鳥畜已三年。能言者甚夥。更能呼抗日口號。片刻。八哥果　其細小之舌而作淸晰之人語曰。「打倒日本·打倒日木。」且呼且躍。若有無限之痛僨。亦似勇敢之形態。洵可嘉哉。八哥能言不爲奇。能作抗日之口號。則不多聞矣。</p>

<p>— 錢台生</p>
<p>新民族英雄馬占山將軍在嫩江一役。高揭義旗。最近在關外更大舉進攻僞國。使關外的無數鐵血健兒從此蜂起。但關内民衆已没有以前那樣的踴躍輸將。這是不得不使人痛心的。</p>
<p>一二八事起十九路軍及第五軍和義勇軍奮勇抵抗。民族的血液換得國際上的同情。戰區民衆忍受的痛苦。給外人一個更大的刺激。那時軍中需用何物。幾乎一呼千諾。内地各省由無線電中報告。連日連夜趕速運輸。軍民合作的精神。在這一點上。表現無遺。</p>
<p>我們還記得當民國十六年革命軍初抵江浙兩省的時候。民衆歡躍沸騰的精神。軍民合作的表現。决不比現在更差一些。如嚴州諸曁一帶。山中農民帮同革命軍用土砲攻擊那時孟昭月的軍隊。使人聯想到那時的民衆對革命軍的熱望了。</p>
<p>這種土包名字呌檀樹砲。用山中一種堅硬的檀樹。把樹心雕空了。剩一個殻子。外面再用鐵皮包裏。砲彈也是用土法製造的。用火藥和鄕人的釘鞋釘。放出去。每砲也有三里路。不過開了十砲以後便不能用了。</p>
<p>當時孟昭月的軍隊都說。革命軍的砲彈是有尾巴的。眞夢也想不到却是鄕人的釘鞋釘。</p>

<p>在這樣酷暑的天氣，级夠躱在鄕村裏看一點書，這是誰也以爲報福的，所以，吾能如願以償，也自覺足可强顏作笑，雖自我認識了人世，環境的苦悶便重重地壓將上來。</p>
<p>這是我的故鄕，不久以前，被敵人强佔着，使破了瓜的處女益發憔悴了·啊！這寒村，這破了瓜的處女般的寒村！幽　密箐，遮蔽了轟炸的殘痕，蛙鼓蟬琴，交奏着自然的響樂；這慘痛，這煩惱，永永的忘不了。</p>
<p>鄕村生活，固然恬靜而安閒，可是在時代的狂　裏，檏實的籠罩，也因風濤的推進而有顯著的動搖，最神聖，最靜趣的鄕村，將從此在内地改造，</p>
<p>晚霞一抹，流　婉　，小立池邊柳下，和陌上老農閒話，從純厚的談吐裏追尋人生，在這樣凈潔的環境裏，再也没有一絲市惡　之氣息存在。</p>
<p>鄕村經濟崩潰，並不是今天的象徵，它早已暗示這是必然的事，然而農夫們還努力地補救，戴了箬笠，在田裏奮鋤着，驕陽使他們肩背成了古銅色，這大無畏的精神，就是最偉大的人生勇士之特徵，和隨着鼓角聲前進掃除人類公敵的戰士同樣有崇拜的價値，勇士，大無畏的勇士，他們最無負於人世，人世却負了他們，</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>前兩日做了「自殺之眞相二文，意猶未盡，因爲有事到了蘇州去一趟，今天換一個題目，仍舊將前文未了的意義，更澈底地申說一下。</p>
<p>諸君（這個諸君是對講求戀愛的諸君，不是普通的諸君，）看了我前日的談言，主張晚婚，主張不談戀愛，恐諸君有些不高興，不配胃口，眞所謂以「不入耳之言來相勸勉」了，今天我來敎諸君一個弔膀子的法子，諸君阿要歡迎我言？</p>
<p>諸君欲去弔膀子麽？其惟的條件，就是去專心求學，專心求學與弔膀子，原是不相干的，爲什麽說是弔膀子的惟一條件呢，我來解釋給諸君聽，現在的女子，其虚榮心（這是普通性，不但女子，）十分厲害，假定你在學校中，有特别的藝能，卓絶的學識，一般異性，自在而然地會來崇拜你，親近你，仰攀你，調轉頭要弔膀子「拜倒你西裝脚下」。否則任你西裝十分挺刮，皮鞋十分光亮，頭髮上的「司丹康」一瓶一瓶倒上去，異性决不—决不—來歡迎你，就是歡迎，也是「下作」，什麽敎下作，就是下等的動作，全没有意義的，現在諸君弔膀子的手續，大都恐怕是弄差了。</p>
<p>諸君不信麽？你們學校裏，一定有兩種學生，一種很用功而有本領的學生，一種是專喜修飾而撒爛汚的學生，試問諸位「密司」們，對於以上兩種的學生，作如何的態度，對於何種學生態度比較親善，在這一點上，就可試騐得出，再去看政储裏有學問的要人，年紀一把，還有幾位年輕貌美摩登密司，肯來遷就，還要請他們來盡義務，（這義務二字原是蔣校長的妙語）這原是很希奇的事。</p>
<p>并且婚姻二字，不久的將來，要根本剷除了，俄國的共產黨，把婚姻制度，完全打消，一變而爲「朋友式」的夫妻制度，就東西各國，婚姻制度，雖未打消，然大都自由而不結婚，直要到生活安定之後，然後結婚，故聽說他們有結婚，所以非常之晚，至於我國要人，離了一個，再娶一個，把結婚的夫妻，看做朋友不如，這不是把一種夫妻制度根本破壞麽，尤其是生產落後的中國，一般平民，個人生活，尚難維持，若組家庭，負担更重，如何能担當得起，自殺數量，特别的多，或者就是這個緣故。</p>
<p>若諸君把這個道理，完全看穿，對於人生的觀念，用另一種眼光去觀察，對於不論何種事業，先要把此中利害，去澈底地考量一番，研究一番，然後下手去做，方爲妥當，否則「福爲禍門」，現在興高釆烈，後來要懊悔莫及了！</p>

<h3 id="c217">銀的雕刻法 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 櫻樓</p>
<p>不久以前我在本欄介紹關於銅和鐵的爛蝕雕刻法。這種富有藝術趣味的小工藝。確自很有價値的。在此我想再來介紹銀的雕刻法。銀的質地比較其他金屬似乎柔軟一些。所以有時候用刀來雕刻也能奏效。不過人工的方法。總不如化學作用的便利敏捷。而且饒有興趣。</p>
<p>銀的防爛的藥劑。大致和銅鐵相同。比較便利的方法。可以用蜜臘四分。牛脂一分。松脂五分。松根油十分配合起來。調成液體。便可以使用。</p>
<p>銀的爛蝕的藥劑。有好幾種配合方法。</p>
<p>（一）用强硝酸十分溶解在二十分之水内。就可以應用。（倘刻物較大。可多置强硝酸與倍量之水溶合即成）這是一種極簡單方法。而且牠的爛蝕作用也很强。</p>
<p>（二）用鹽酸鉀三十格蘭姆。溶合在三百分之沸水内。再用純鹽酸三十格蘭姆。溶化在三百分之水内。把以上兩種溶液調合在一起。即可使用。此劑之爛蝕力較第一法更爲强烈。</p>
<p>（三）純硝酸二百五十分。以太六十分。　酸四分。溶合在二百五十分之水内即成。此種藥劑其化學作用較緩。適合於精細的雕刻。</p>
<p>關於銀的爛蝕雕刻。有一個缺憾。就是因爲銀的價値較貴。銀器施以爛蝕作用以後。其爛去部份的碎銀。完全棄去。未免可惜。不過如用上述第一種爛蝕藥劑。却有補救的辦法。當强硝酸與水把銀器爛蝕雕刻後。液中便有一種硝酸銀存留着。我們可以在液中加以食鹽。硝酸銀經食鹽的緣化鈉的化合作用。即把銀質下沉。而成白色之鹽化銀。然後把牠濾過弄乾。再加與鹽化銀同量的炭酸鉀鈉。放在鉛製的鍋子裏。用煤火燒熱便回復原來的銀質沈在鍋底而凝結成塊。這樣一來便没有損失了。不過此法適用於耗銀過多的銀器雕刻。假如刻去部份不多。棄之並不可惜。那也不必再去麻煩了</p>

<p>ＸＸ學校的英文敎員Ｘ行生，雅善</p>
<p>修飾，喜穿西裝，惜乎面麻，是其缺憾，一日値它上課，方當點過了名，隨手抓起一支粉筆，剛想舉手揮寫時，瞧見黑板上留着字蹟數行，就無意地念了一遍，不禁勃然大怒「混賬」「放屁」頓時像聯珠般的倒了出來，你道爲何？原來寫的是</p>
<p>「翻轉石榴皮，泥印釘鞋底，兩般凹凸形，就是先生面」</p>
<p>這首五絶，明明爲它寫照，而尋他的開心，怪不得要氣憤塡膺，破口大駡呢，他駡了幾聲，馬上回過臉來，注意於各人的態度，要想察探到底是誰玩的把戲，這是闔校夙以搗亂著稱小李，正笑得前俯後仰，不亦樂乎，Ｘ先生因認爲一定又是它的搗亂就聲色俱厲的斥責起來，可是這個亂，子並非是它搗的，當然不甘忍受，立起反抗，說</p>
<p>「Ｘ先生，你不要胡亂駡人，那邊還有一張字條張着，你把牠核對一下，字蹟是否相同，而且是否我的字蹟，」說時用手向牆上一指，Ｘ先生隨它指處望去，果見貼着一張字紙把牠揭下一看，知道又是一首嘲笑自已的玩藝詩曰··「先生畢竟愛摩登，身上西裝簇嶄新，最是令人稱美化，雕成滿面百花紋」</p>
<p>它此時眞氣得發昏，轉將根究二字忘掉，連授課都没了心思，不待到點的鐘聲響動，就拿起書本，跑出課堂，明天起，即與校中脫離關係，</p>

<p>黑幕</p>
<h3 id="c219">敎訓了他 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 永年</p>
<p>不錯，這一件事，的確敎訓了他，使他明白了黑暗社會中的黑幕，更使他覺悟了旣往的一切皆非。</p>
<p>本來，他是個摩登式的少年，西裝革履，面貌又生得漂亮，而且又長於交際的口才，因之，對於異性的誘惑性，是很濃厚的。</p>
<p>前天，是星期日，正是Ｘ大劇塲表演轟動一時的Ｘ大戲劇，他當然照例的打扮得很漂亮的，光顧ＸＸ大劇塲，他進去之後，他第一個目的，自然是找求異性，兩隻銳利的鼠目，不着東西的溜來溜去，找尋他心目中所要求的異性，在樓上，他忽然找到了一個他心目中所應要的異性，那個異性，衣服旣是異常的美麗，而且面貌和身段，又是非常的摩登美，恰巧她的旁邊，空着一個座位，他一見之下，正是喜之不盡，老實不客氣的在她旁邊坐了下來。</p>
<p>戲劇表演了，他很平靜的瞧着臺上，但是他的腦中，正在忙着運轉著，怎樣開口和她搭訕的念頭。</p>
<p>約摸過了半個鐘點，他裝大他的膽，這樣說，「密司……你……可是……一個子……來……」他說後他的一顆心，跳得很厲害，</p>
<p>「……」她是没有說，可是她的身體，微微的移動了一下，對他微微的笑了笑。</p>
<p>他快活極了，他知她也有意於他，因之更膽大的用右臂在她的左臂上輕輕的撞了撞，再又說着「密司……多麽美麗啊」。</p>
<p>經過再三的引誘，她已被他誘惑了，兩人已慢慢地談得入情了，坐在旁邊的人，誰也猜不着他們倆是怎樣的，</p>
<p>他順便探聽她的身世，她一一都告知了他他才知，道她是Ｘ富紳的千金，他不由暗暗稱善他的艶福不淺。</p>
<p>一回兒，招待員領了一個人，到他們面前，他倆不由都吃了一驚，她一瞧，却是她家的女傭人，不由問道「你來做甚？」</p>
<p>「小姐，尋得我好苦，家裏老爺有要緊事要找你，呌你立刻回去，」女傭人氣喘着說。</p>
<p>「唔……眞討厭」她很不快的說，「我們明天會吧，再會」她又對他說，「不要忘記，明天仍在這裏等你，」她點點頭，領了女傭人，姗姗的去了。</p>
<p>她走了，他便覺没趣，所以也走了，回到家裏，坐想方才的事，不由懊悔起來，没有問她住在什麽地方，萬一她不來，好寫信去問她！忽然，他伸手到袋中時，他的面色，立時慘白起來，同時氣也急了，形色也忙亂了，原來他袋中所存的一隻皮夾，已不翼而飛了，内中藏有三百元鈔票，他不知道什麽時候失去的，他極力的想，但終想不起來，一瞬之間，他突然想起了她來，彷佛覺得和她談話時，她的手在他的袋上撞了撞，說不定這皮夾或者就是她竊去的他越想越像，不由痛恨起來，從此，他見了女人，終是惡恨恨地不敢逼視。</p>

<p>「喂，先生，黄包車要不要？」阿三看見有一個西裝少年站着不動所以忙拖了車子趨到少年旁邊問道，</p>
<p>「麗華公司幾錢？」西裝少年問道</p>
<p>「三角洋錢好吧？先生」阿三睜開大眼靜候那少年的答覆「三百錢，多一錢也不要」西裝少年很堅持的回答，</p>
<p>那時候旅客愈聚愈多，汽車馬車嘈雜聲，黄包車夫的　軋，使得旅客行路不便，車站上管理治安的警察，忙把他手裏拿的鞭子，向阿三身上猛擊，趕他走開，阿三恐怕照會被那警察撕去，忙把車子飛也似的拖開，一煞間那西裝少年也不見了，阿三没法，只得失望似的立着對那汽車馬車發怔，</p>

<p>— 士本</p>
<p>何老爺眞夠好福氣，年紀不曾滿五十歲，已有兩個兒子，兩個孫子，並且祖上遺下五十多萬的家產，在我們鄕裏，他要算首屈一指的丁財兩旺的福氣人了。</p>
<p>他終日抽抽大烟，打打麻雀，一切家務，都委大兒子主持，自已絲毫不去顧問，何等地消遙快樂，並且老夫妻倆，雖則年已不小，但是老愛情仍舊非常濃厚，加之兒子媳婦，都很孝敬他，所以在何老爺整個家庭中，天天充滿着融融樂樂的空氣，從來没有發生過一次齟齬爭吵的事情，人們見到他家這樣上和下睦，都羨慕着說，何老爺的家庭，正方興未艾哩。</p>
<p>靜極思動，飽暖思淫慾，這兩句話，不幸的在何老爺的胸中，誕生出來了，今年春間，何老爺家居氣悶，到上海去遊玩，在旅館裏結識了一位摩豋女子，被她灌足了迷湯，何老爺竟有相見恨晚之慨，千方百計的化了千外塊錢，把她討了回來。</p>
<p>自從這位姨太太討進了何家門口，融和的空氣，突然打破，因爲她是一個摩登女子，在上海度慣奢華的生活，吃的着的，都是名貴的東西，像何太太這種儉樸的人，眼簾中怎能擱入這種奢華的舉動，所以她進來不上一個月，何太太已和她吵閙起來了，原來何太太不但是完全爲了吝惜她的揮霍，醋的酸素，也佔着重要的成分，但是她也不是好來路，潑天潑地慣的，那肯示弱呢，所以何太太和她閙到後來，必定要演出全武行的把戲，結果，何太太年紀大了，脚小伶仃，豈是那粗粗脚的摩豋太太的敵手，吃了敗杖，哭喪着臉，跑去告訴自已的兒子，本來何老爺討這個花枝招展的後生姨太太進來，他的兒子，也早已大不爲然，背地裏暗埋怨，老子眞夠不應該，上了年紀，兒孫都有，還要討這個禍水來做怎麽，將來必要弄夠不了之局，心裏雖然這樣埋怨，然而總是（横撑船大人是，）也就默默不語，現在看見自已的母親，被她毆打侮辱，那也不能再事緘默，即忙跑去和她理論，結果也只有舌戰了一陣，自此以後，何太太怨丈夫做出這種亡恩負義的行爲，也就將昔日的情感，付之九霄，天天不是和她打架，就是和丈夫拌嘴，兩個兒子，也嫌老不正經，討這個敗家精來揮霍家產，也就和老子隔閡起來，事事留意戒嚴，有時帮了母親，也和老子及她爭吵爭吵，家裏一切舉動，也莫不分疆劃界，彼此各覇一方，不相統屬了。</p>
<p>唉！融融洽洽的家庭，一旦來了一根導火線，就此把整個美滿的狀態，打得四分五裂，夫婦不睦，父子不和，何老爺的家中，從此和我們貴國一樣，常常顯露着一種互相猜忌的敵對行爲。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Northeast Volunteer Army: Yi An <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>A bullet in the gun, it must pierce the national enemy. A drop of blood on the body, it must repay the motherland. This is a good man, this is a great man, this is a chivalrous hero. Who should not be like this? Yet, those who consistently are like this, I cannot help but sing and praise the Northeast Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, [they] erected flags, grasped military power. Those who usually benefited from the Northeast and considered the Northeast as important, abandoned their 300,000 troops as if they were worn-out shoes. This is enough to shame the faces of patriots and diminish the spirit of the nation. My Northeast has been lost for ten months. Yet, even now, they can make the ambitious Japanese sit on needles. Their military police are exhausted from rushing around, and deaths fill the roads. Whose power is this? The pseudo-organizations calling themselves kings and dukes, like monkeys wearing hats, dare not even boast within their own rooms, anxiously as if unable to protect their own leaders. Whose power is this? [They] make my Northeast lost but not lost, and a glimmer of hope remains today. The people of the nation can still pull and maintain [the situation]. Whose power is this? Isn't it the power of the Volunteer Army's hard fighting for several months? Alas, the authorities of the Northeast abandoned them, but the people protect them. Those who benefited from it abandoned it, but those who served in it protect it. Those responsible with armed forces abandoned it, but those who temporarily joined together, raising poles and carrying hoes, protect it. When I speak of the Northeast, I do not know where my tears should come from.</p>
<p>There is no braver bravery than the Volunteer Army's bravery. There is no more dangerous danger than the Volunteer Army's danger. Risking ten thousand deaths to defend the national territory, with short guns and fast horses, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, they do not hesitate to use their flesh and blood to fight against cannons, tanks, airplanes, and armored vehicles. This tragic and intense scene is rarely seen in the world. Eugenist Mr. Pan Guangdan said that the Chinese nation is strongest in the Northeast. His words are proven true. However, there is no internal supply, and no external support. [They] work on empty stomachs and fight with festering wounds. Military food, ammunition, medical supplies, and other necessities for combat are all lacking. Our central government and various provinces have not provided even one tenth of one unit's worth of aid. Suspended in a desperate situation, with blood but no iron, hundreds of thousands of brave men raise their heads and brains to fight for a breath of life for the motherland. Blue blood paints the White Mountains, and red hearts illuminate the Black River. Loyalty and righteousness can inspire the hearts of soldiers, but cannot fill their stomachs. Courage can break the enemy's courage, but cannot resist enemy bullets. Making people of the entire country still sit and watch without helping. Support after support, hard fight after hard fight. Food exhausted, ammunition depleted. Wounded heavily, strength exhausted. Soon, these hundreds of thousands of heroes and good men who risked their lives to defend the country will be lying side by side, corpses in the hands of the enemy. In the future, only a painful and tragic page will be left in the history of national subjugation. "Year after year, on the Liaohai Sea, where can one weep for the autumn wind in writing?" As I write this, my heart breaks, and my hand trembles.</p>
<p>If the Northeast falls, the whole country will follow. If the Volunteer Army is exhausted, then our nation will be exhausted with it. Our land is limited, but the enemy's desires are insatiable. Did we not see that Jinzhou was occupied, swallowing the entire Northeast, and then the Shanghai Incident quickly occurred? Did we not see that the Northeast Volunteer Army rose up to resist the enemy, and the enemy troops quickly withdrew, and the Shanghai Incident was temporarily stopped? Did we not see that the Volunteer Army's strength slightly diminished, and then warnings were transmitted again from Peiping and Tianjin? The Northeast Volunteer Army not only prevents the enemy from comfortably seizing the Northeast, but also allows the interior and coastal areas to remain undisturbed. How can it not be thanks to the Volunteer Army restraining the enemy? How can our countrymen regard the Volunteer Army as the people of Qin regarded the fat and thin of the people of Yue, indifferent? Only a very small minority among them calls for and runs around for them. Treading on frost, solid ice. When the lips are gone, the teeth are cold. The survival or destruction of our country, the life or death of our nation, all depend on whether the people of the country can help the Northeast Volunteer Army.</p>

<p>More than 10,000 Kuang bandits were completely defeated</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Shike, commander of the Independent 40th Brigade, telegraphed Nanjing on the 14th to report that his unit, together with the 4th Division, recaptured Huoqiu and entered the city on the morning of the 13th.

<p>(Nanjing) Government officials said that the report that Chiang sent an envoy to Japan with a mission for direct Sino-Japanese negotiations is absolutely not true. Considering that Uchida has recently repeatedly declared that discussing the Manchurian issue with China has become meaningless, and stated that "Manchuria can never be returned to China," Japan's complete lack of sincerity is obvious. This is sufficient evidence that the direct negotiation claim is inaccurate. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomats said that Japan's economic situation is gradually falling into difficulty, and it is also unable to deal with the Volunteer Army in the Northeast. The transportation of coal and food back to the country has led to unemployment in domestic coal mines and bankruptcy in rural areas. Although the military forcibly ordered the industrial sector to invest in the Northeast, they are also at a loss. The younger generation still has an arrogant attitude and wants to further expand the situation, but there are no good solutions. Conflicts between the Seiyukai and Minseito parties in the government are gradually rising, and the Prime Minister cannot mediate. Fascist elements in the opposition are eager to take over. From these various observations, if the Japanese political situation does not seek self-relief, it may inevitably undergo changes if it continues in this way. (15th dispatch)</p>

<p>—Implement a blockade policy—</p>
<p>The Inspector General of Customs first issued a warning</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance have developed a final response to the Northeast and Dalian customs issue. If the protest is ineffective, they can only implement a blockade policy, ordering customs in various ports of China to collect import duties for Northeast and Dalian customs when goods are shipped or pass through. When the Northeast customs collects double taxes, commerce will inevitably be greatly affected. The United Kingdom and the United States have always been enthusiastic in maintaining the integrity of China's customs system and should be able to understand this measure. The Inspector General of Customs will first issue a final warning, giving a period of hesitation, and will resolutely implement it when it is unavoidable. (15th dispatch)</p>

<p>Noulens' Wife's Life Is in Danger</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of Noulens being released from prison for medical treatment, the Ministry of Justice and Administration has limited it to treatment at the Central Hospital in Nanjing. The Gulou Hospital is also permissible, but Noulens insists on going to a foreign hospital in the Shanghai International Settlement for treatment, otherwise he will resolutely not leave prison, and his attitude remains very strong. Presiding Judge Li Mian will arrive in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 15th to decide on a solution. If the medical treatment issue cannot be resolved today, and the couple are in a dangerous period due to prolonged fasting, and have lost control of their bowels and bladder, with soiled clothing and swarms of flies, they will be temporarily moved to a larger room to live in to avoid hindering hygiene.

(15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of transferring jurisdiction over the Noulens case, Noulens' lawyer Chen Ying has submitted a petition to the Supreme Court requesting that it be transferred to the Second Branch of the Shanghai High Court for trial.

In addition, Xu Dongfan, a counselor from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also arrived at the detention center under orders to visit the Noulens couple. Noulens' relative, Feng Jiesi, came along. President Zhou, Prosecutor Lou, and Director Gong accompanied them to the detention center to persuade them to go to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible. Noulens replied that he did not want to go to a hospital in Nanjing, nor did he hope to be treated in separate rooms. If he is not allowed to move to Shanghai, he has the greatest determination to starve to death here. At 6:00 p.m., a doctor from Gulou Hospital also came to the detention center to visit. According to him, if they can regularly drink soda, their lives can be extended for a few more days. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Lawyers Association issued a declaration on the Noulens case on the 15th: (1) They hope that the court will fully exercise the spirit of judicial independence.

The judicial authorities also stated on the 13th that the Noulens were free to choose any hospital in Nanjing for medical treatment. When Dr. Pei visited Noulens at the detention center on the 14th, he informed them of this and persuaded Noulens to move to Gulou Hospital for treatment. Noulens agreed, but his wife resolutely opposed and vowed to fast to death. Pei was unable to do anything. Therefore, the Noulens couple were still in the detention center on the 14th. It is said that if the Noulens are still determined and do not wake up, their lives may be in danger within a few days. (15th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Japan Conditions Participation of Puppet State</p>
<p>Using Impossible Matters to Make Things Difficult for Friendly Nations</p>
<p>China United Press, Osaka, 15th - According to tonight's Asahi Shimbun, the League of Nations investigation team, as a result of consultations with Araki and Uchida, stated bluntly that the Mukden Incident induced the Far East War, which Japan was happy to do. Therefore, all previous studies of the Mukden Incident were opposed by Japan, which strongly advocated convening an international conference to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. Japan conditionally recognized this proposal, its condition being that the Manchurian puppet state must be one of the participating countries in the international conference. If this condition is recognized by the countries concerned, Japan will ultimately not oppose the international conference. However, if the investigation team recognizes Japan's demands, it will violate the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty are unlikely to agree. If the Nine-Power Treaty is disregarded, what principles can be used to make other countries agree to participate in the international conference? This is impossible. The result of Japan's difficulty exposes its ambitions to the whole world.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - It is widely reported in today's British newspapers that Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida, in his last conversation with the League of Nations investigation team, stated that once Japan recognized "Manchukuo," it would refuse to negotiate with China or the League of Nations regarding the new state's affairs. This has sparked a discussion on whether a large group of international diplomats, after expressing their great opinions at the League of Nations General Assembly, have ultimately moved or defeated Japan's strategy. There is currently no commentary from London political circles. However, Reuters has gathered opinions from various responsible persons, who unanimously believe that any country that recognizes "Manchukuo" before it clearly has a permanently stable government in Manchuria will be accused of violating the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, it is generally felt that although Japan will eventually recognize "Manchukuo," it will do so cautiously and will not risk the world's great disapproval and the danger of causing unpleasant international disputes.</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Araki Asserts No Withdrawal of Troops Stationed in Manchuria</p>
<p>Going So Far as to Say Manchuria is Japan's First Line of Defense</p>
<p>China United Press - According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun of the 9th, when the League of Nations investigation team visited Minister of the Army Araki at 10:00 AM on the 9th, they raised three questions: (1) What is the relationship between Manchuria and Japan's national defense? (2) What is the policy for maintaining the rule of Manchuria and Mongolia? (3) What is the future of the Manchurian puppet state? What policy will the Japanese military adopt? Araki answered as follows: (1) Since the Meiji Restoration, the relationship between Manchuria and Japan, forged through the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, makes Manchuria Japan's first line of defense. (2) Based on the above reason, maintaining the security of Manchuria is absolutely necessary for Japan's national defense and self-defense. Japan will not spare any sacrifice for this obligation. The current incident is also due to the anti-Japanese policies adopted by the Chinese government in the three northeastern provinces for many years, infringing on rights and interests and hindering Japan's security. Therefore, Japan used force to maintain Japan's position. Japan absolutely cannot withdraw its troops from the three northeastern provinces. (3) Manchukuo is a state created by the general will of 30 million people in Manchuria (Japanese people are unilaterally deceiving the world, the Volunteer Armies are rising everywhere, protesting their conspiracy, and the Japanese military is still shamelessly unable to reflect, but forcibly speaks absurd arguments), wishing to build a paradise where people can live and work in peace and contentment. This declaration is in line with Japan's national defense policy. Japan will spare no effort to assist its development. Those who do not recognize Manchukuo and hinder its development from within and without, the Japanese government will use force to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Japanese Citizens Enthusiastically Donate Funds to Manufacture Aircraft</p>
<p>Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 15th - Since the Manchurian Incident, more than 50 Patriotic Aircraft manufactured with national donations have been completed. Recently, the people of Manchuria and Japanese residents in Manchuria jointly donated 400,000 yen to manufacture a latest-style elite aircraft to be presented to the Ministry of the Army. The four Patriotic Aircraft donated by Koreans are also nearing completion. The Army authorities plan to form all the Patriotic Aircraft into an independent flight squadron in April next year, appointing a Major General as the commander, to complete the air defense positions of the capital and major areas. After this squadron is realized, in the event of an emergency, it can be dispatched within five or ten minutes.</p>

<p>Only Seeking to Solve European Problems</p>
<p>Unrelated to War Debts with the United States</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - The British government has formally denied French Prime Minister Herriot's statement that Britain cannot pay its war debts to the United States without first consulting France. An official statement was released to Reuters yesterday, stating that the British-French declaration of cooperation to solve European problems does not apply to Britain's debt to the United States. The phrase "European situation" used in the joint declaration clearly indicates that it does not involve issues of non-European countries. British Prime Minister MacDonald said on Tuesday in the House of Commons, explaining his views on this issue, that if any negotiation were to be made here or in the United States, thinking that Europe has jointly expressed a request to the United States in Lausanne similar to the American model, then this negotiation would have tragic consequences. I am aware of this, so I want the world to absolutely understand that Lausanne only seeks to solve internal European difficulties and agree on methods that the participating countries deem necessary and possible. Downing Street later issued a statement mentioning the misunderstanding of the British Minister of Finance Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on Sunday. Chamberlain did not say that the US representatives had openly or secretly agreed to the Lausanne proceedings, nor did he imply that the US representatives had agreed. The Lausanne process has always been based on the premise of only seeking to solve European reparations issues and not involving the United States in the discussion.</p>

<p>National Press, Brussels, 14th - Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans read the British-French declaration in the Lower House of Parliament today (i.e., the British-French mutual trust agreement, which some also translate as a credit agreement, because the French side calls it an agreement, while the British regard it as a document of consent).

<p>National Press, Paris, 14th - The French Foreign Office released the full text of the Gentlemen's Agreement this afternoon as follows: The Lausanne Convention will not take effect until it is ratified. As far as the governments of the creditor countries that have already signed the convention are concerned, unless satisfactory arrangements are made between those governments and the creditor countries themselves, the Lausanne Convention will not be ratified. Each government can fully freely explain its views to its parliament. However, within the Treaty of Versailles, this agreement is not used as concrete evidence. If its own debt is satisfactorily resolved in the future, the governments of the creditor countries concerned will proceed with the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles and take effect. If a satisfactory resolution cannot be obtained, the Treaty of Versailles will not be ratified. A new situation will arise at that time. What should be done will be discussed and understood by the governments concerned. At that time, the legal status of the governments concerned will be the same as during the Hoover moratorium. This agreement should be notified to the German government immediately. Signed in Lausanne on July 2, 1932.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 14th - President Hoover stated in a letter to Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that he was not fully aware whether the "Gentlemen's Agreement" established by European countries after the Lausanne Conference was a united front against the United States. However, if such an intention did exist, he believed the United States would not necessarily be forced to take any action. Regarding the Lausanne Agreement, European countries never sought the opinion of the United States, so the United States is absolutely not bound by it. The aforementioned "Gentlemen's Agreement" stipulates that European creditor nations signing the Lausanne Convention must obtain a satisfactory resolution with their creditor nations before ratifying the convention.</p>

<p>European Eight Small Nations' Disarmament Representatives Strongly Advocate</p>
<p>Abolishing Aerial Bombardment</p>
<p>Simon's Proposal Delayed for Discussion</p>
<p>Russian Representative Proposes Minimum Requirements</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 14th - Representatives of the eight small European nations met with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson today, strongly advocating the complete abolition of aerial bombardment. The representatives of the eight small nations intend to expand the scope of the resolution proposed by British Foreign Secretary Simon. Simon advocated that the Disarmament Conference should pass a motion before the adjournment, stating the points on which all countries have already agreed. Simon's proposal was originally scheduled to be discussed on Saturday, but has now been postponed and a new date has not yet been decided. The Disarmament Conference has been in session for five months and may not be able to conclude before the end of next week.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 14th - The Soviet Russian delegation to the Disarmament Conference released a statement this evening, stating that the draft resolution released on July 11th has been received by the Soviet Russian delegation. The delegation has now submitted the Soviet Russian's minimum requirements to Foreign Secretary Simon and Czech representative Benes. According to the Soviet Russian, any solution that does not adopt these minimum measures cannot be accepted by the Soviet Russian delegation. The main points of the Soviet Russian's requirements are summarized as follows: (1) All existing armaments must be reduced in quantity. The first step must be a reduction of at least one-third, but this does not apply to all small countries or countries that have disarmed under other international treaties. (2) All bombing aircraft must be completely abolished. (3) All types of fighting vehicles must be abolished. (4) The caliber of land-based heavy artillery must be limited, with a maximum caliber not exceeding 100 millimeters. The caliber of artillery used for coastal defense must also be limited. (5) Establish an office in the middle of the two sessions of the Disarmament Conference to draft practical proposals to implement the principle of reducing the total amount of naval armaments by one-third for all types of warships.</p>

<p>Discussing Resolving Anglo-Irish Disputes</p>
<p>Increased Taxes on Irish Goods Imported to Britain</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - After the Irish Free State stopped paying land taxes, the British government decided to impose special taxes on imports from the Free State to make up for the losses. Free State President de Valera also intends to increase tax rates to counter British goods, leading to increasingly intense Anglo-Irish disputes. However, there was a sudden turnaround yesterday. After midnight yesterday, the authorities announced that de Valera had accepted British Prime Minister MacDonald's invitation and would leave Dublin this morning to come here and discuss with the British Prime Minister. There was an important meeting at the British Prime Minister's residence last night. The attendees included Prime Minister MacDonald, Attorney General Sankey, and Lord Chancellor Inskip. The opposing side included Irish Labour Party leader Norton, British Labour Party leader Lansbury, and other important Labour Party members. After the meeting, the authorities claimed that MacDonald wanted to meet de Valera in London today to discuss the Anglo-Irish incident, hoping for a friendly resolution. Norton immediately conveyed this to de Valera by telephone, who agreed to accept. When Norton arrived here from Ireland before the meeting, he told Reuters reporters that he had brought a proposal to resolve the Anglo-Irish dispute. This proposal has been approved by the Irish government and hopes that the British government can accept it.</p>
<p>Reuters, Dublin, 14th - The Irish Free State Parliament today passed an emergency special tax bill by a vote of 66 to 51, canceling imperial preferential treatment and increasing tax rates on certain imports from Britain. Finance Minister MacEntee stated that this move was not for retaliation but for self-defense. The Irish government still hopes to maintain good relations with Britain, but it has no choice but to protect its rights due to unreasonable attacks. MacEntee criticized the measures taken by the British government, saying that they were not only not permitted by facts, but also did not help the matter. "What the British have taken away from our agricultural products can all be recovered through tariffs. The current Anglo-Irish dispute is not the first time the British have attempted to undermine Irish industry," he said.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - Exporters from the Free State rushed to load goods onto ships to transport them to Britain overnight to avoid the new taxes, as Britain has decided to implement special taxes on certain goods imported from the Free State starting tonight. Approximately 6,000 head of cattle, sheep, and pigs, as well as 200 tons of cream and eggs, were transported to Liverpool. Those arriving earlier could avoid the special taxes, but several ships arriving later could not avoid the taxes because the Liverpool customs office had already closed at 4:00 PM.</p>

<p>Havas, Romanian Capital, 14th - Official sources confirmed that Romanian representative Titulescu and Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov are continuing to negotiate a Russo-Romanian non-aggression treaty in Geneva, and are slightly optimistic about the future of the negotiations. It is widely believed that once this negotiation is completed, the Russo-Romanian treaty and the Polish-Russian treaty, which was drafted in February, can be signed simultaneously. However, if the Romanian negotiations with Soviet Russia fail, Poland will immediately sign the Polish-Russian treaty, but will reserve the right of parliamentary approval. Polish ratification procedures will be slightly delayed, so that if Romania and Soviet Russia intend to reopen negotiations, they can still proceed calmly.</p>

<p>Cai Tingkai Successfully Mediates Between Both Sides</p>
<p>Inland River Vessels Return to Guangdong, Seagoing Vessels Head to Xiamen</p>
<p>Marine Corps Reorganized by the 19th Route Army</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Chen Jitang's army attacked Qiongzhou, it is heard that the various fortresses in Qiongzhou have mostly been bombed by Chen's air force. It is also reported that the Flying Eagle warship and the Fu'an warship stationed in Qiongzhou have been bombed and sunk. According to a customs announcement, the sinking location of the Flying Eagle warship is between 20 degrees 6 minutes 54 seconds north latitude and 110 degrees 19 minutes 9 seconds east longitude, near Haikou, Qiongzhou. The mast of the warship can be seen regardless of whether the tide is high or low, which has aroused great attention from all parties. The Flying Eagle warship is a national defense weapon and is worth approximately three million yuan. If it is unfortunately sacrificed, it would be a great pity. Cai Tingkai has made great efforts to mediate the dispute between the two Chens. Chen Ce's side has agreed to accept the mediation. Chen Jitang's side was initially tough, but after Chen Zhangfu, the commander-in-chief of the attack on Qiongzhou, and Ding Jixu, the captain of the second air squadron, returned to the province by plane on the 8th to inquire about the war situation, they also expressed their support for reconciliation. Therefore, Chen Jitang had no choice but to agree to the mediation. On the 6th and 7th, Cai Tingkai repeatedly telegraphed Chen Jitang from his hotel in Hong Kong to discuss the resolution of the Qiongzhou matter. On the 6th, he also sent Fan Qiwu to the province to negotiate the terms of mediation with Chen. Chen Jitang then sent Xiang Hanping to Hong Kong to represent him in discussing everything with Chen Ce. All the agreed upon situations were telegraphed to Chen Jitang by Xiang, and Chen then replied agreeing. It is heard that the general solution for the Qiongzhou matter is that the seagoing warships will sail to Xiamen and be dispatched by the 19th Route Army, the inland river fleet will be incorporated into the First Group Army, and the Marine Corps stationed in Qiongzhou will be transferred to Fujian to assist the 19th Route Army in reorganizing and suppressing the communists. This is the principle that both sides have clearly acknowledged. Other ancillary conditions, such as the protection of the current naval personnel and the First Group Army's subsidy for the Marine Corps' military expenses in Fujian, are still under negotiation. As for the Marine Corps' departure expenses, it is heard that they will be raised by the mediators borrowing 100,000 yuan from Qiongzhou. Qiongzhou people in Hong Kong have been holding meetings for days to discuss the loan. As a result, the Qiongya Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong will bear 30,000 yuan, the Haikou Chamber of Commerce will bear 40,000 yuan, and the remaining 30,000 yuan will be borrowed and advanced by individual Qiongzhou merchants in Hong Kong, guaranteed by a certain bank, and repaid within three months. Regarding the Marine Corps' monthly military expenses, Chen Jitang has agreed to subsidize 100,000 yuan per month, but only for three months. Cai Tingkai is about to go to Fujian and cannot wait any longer. He has recently sent Tan Qixiu and Weng Guiqing to Qiongzhou during the day to lead the Marine Corps to Fujian. Chen Ce will leave Qiongzhou after the Marine Corps leaves and may go abroad for several months of inspection before returning to the country. (July 11)</p>
<h3 id="e93">New Situation in Guangdong and Fujian Suppressing Bandits <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Luo Binghui's Troops Attack Shizhong and Longyan</p>
<p>Bandit Troops Now Regard the Guangdong Border as the Forefront</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After the Zhanglong communist bandits fled back to southern Jiangxi, it was heard that Chiang Kai-shek was very anxious about the bandit suppression conference in Lushan and was also discussing response plans in Ruijin. After the bandits' meeting, they moved one after another, moving and draining the people's food and cash in the bandit-locked areas. It is heard that the main bandit forces are concentrated in five locations: (1) The central area is Ruijin, Shicheng, Guangchang, and Yudu; (2) The western area is Ningdu, Xingguo, Huichang, and Anyuan; (3) The southern area is Xunwu, Dingnan, Qiannan, Longnan, and Xinfeng; (4) The eastern area is Changting, Liancheng, Ninghua, Longyan, and Yong'an; (5) The northern area is the junction of eastern Jiangxi and northern Fujian. Since June 25th, Luo Binghui's troops from Changting have launched a full-scale attack on Shizhong, Longyan. Longyan has a security team reorganized from the Social Democratic Party, which is said to be led by Fu Bocui. When the communist bandits purged the party a few years ago, they killed thousands of Social Democrats, so Fu Bocui and Luo have an irreconcilable hatred. The Shizhong militia has fought bloody battles with the bandits many times and is very strong, so the Red bandits failed to capture Shizhong when they previously attacked Zhangzhou. However, the bandits have long regarded the Shizhong militia as a thorn in their side. For this reason, they went south from Yongding Jinxi, Daxiaochi, Kuzhu, and Kanshi to attack Shizhong, Longyan. The bandit crowd numbered more than 10,000, and Luo Binghui was in Liancheng and Changting to support the rear. Since the 25th, the Shizhong militia has held out against the bandits for five days. By the 30th, it was already on the verge of collapse and sent Xie Yangqi to Zhangzhou to request assistance from the garrison.</p>
<p>After the 19th Route Army arrived in Fujian, it was waiting for the entire bandit suppression plan to be decided, so it has not yet advanced to Tinglian in western Fujian. Li Yangjing, the commander of the 3rd Army of the Guangdong Army, went to Guangzhou last month and has not returned to the front line to this day, so the divisions and brigades stationed on the Fujian border have also stopped their carriages and are not moving forward. Therefore, the communist bandits were able to advance and retreat calmly. The troops in Shanghang and Yongding counties are in the city, while the bandits are stationed in the mountains in the countryside, and it is strange that they are in the same corner. Currently, Huang Renhuan's division of the Guangdong Army is stationed in Wuping Jiaoling, focusing on southern Jiangxi. Huang Yanzhen's and Huang Zhiwen's divisions are also guarding the Jiangxi border. Ouyang Xinquan's regiment, the deputy commander of the 8th Division, entered Xingning County on July 1, but did not advance to Fujian and Jiangxi. According to news from the Jiangxi border, the Red bandits are densely concentrated in Anyuan Xunwu. Luotang to Anyuan is the first line of defense for the bandits, Junmenling is the second line of defense for the bandits, and the area near Ruijin is the third line of defense. New-style trenches have been built, and tunnels connect the artillery positions. At ordinary times, they force the people to do various defensive works and advise the people to dig cellars to avoid airplanes. There is also a radio station to command military affairs in the five districts, with the intention of resisting the war for a long time. The bandits pay the most attention to the Guangdong side, regarding the Guangdong border as the front and Guangxin and Fuzhou as the rear. They do not value the Nanchang side, so the major battle for bandit suppression in the future should be at the junction of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. (June 6)</p>
<h3 id="e94">First Meeting of the Hubei Provincial Political Reorganization <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Chiang Communicates Three Matters to Instruct County Magistrates</p>
<p>And Issues Ten Questions to be Answered Within Three Days</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hubei Provincial Government held the first meeting of the local political reorganization at 8:00 a.m. on the 14th. The attendees included Chairman of the Provincial Government Xia Douyin, the directors of the various departments and committee members, and the county magistrates, the chief of the secretariat section of the Provincial Government, and other people, totaling over one hundred. First, Xia Douyin reported the decision to hold the meeting and introduced the members of the Party and Government Committee who were present, including Yang Yongtai, Zhang Nanxian, He Zhonghan, Qiu, Geng, Peng Jieshi, and other six people. Then, Yang Yongtai conveyed Chiang Commander-in-Chief's handwritten instructions and issued ten questions for the county magistrates to answer, and said that the Commander-in-Chief had great hopes for the county magistrates. Therefore, whether or not this bandit suppression and village cleansing can be successful depends entirely on how the political forces are promoted. We have already informed you all the day before yesterday. Now there are several instructions from the Commander-in-Chief, which I will convey to you all, please pay attention. In addition, the Commander-in-Chief is concerned about the local situation in the counties and has several questions. Please answer them in writing succinctly within three days. Within the major questions, there are several small questions, please answer them separately as well. Then, Zhang Nanxian gave a speech, stating that the Party and Government Committee has a close relationship with the counties. I am representing the committee to attend, and there are several things that you should pay attention to. Articles 7, 12, and 3 of the organizational regulations of the Party and Government Committee are very important. Therefore, during the vigorous bandit suppression and village cleansing, the Commander-in-Chief specially established the Party and Government Committee to assist in handling matters. You must not neglect Articles 123 in the slightest, and everyone should follow them unanimously. The country is currently in a time of crisis, and the responsibilities of the county governments are very important. That is to say, you have very important responsibilities. At this time of life and death, the county magistrates should not be complacent in Wuhan and perfunctorily deal with matters. You must absolutely not have the slightest idea of relaxation or complacency. We must have three conditions for governing: first, we must be honest and upright; second, we must have a plan; third, we must be courageous. To be a county magistrate today is absolutely not to be an official, you must have a spirit of sacrifice and move forward bravely. Then, He Zhonghan gave a speech, stating that to eliminate the communist bandits, we must use the power of organization. The rampant nature of the communist bandits is not because their armed forces are stronger than our party's armed forces, but because their organization is strict. I hope that the county magistrates will strictly organize themselves after returning to their counties, pool their wisdom and efforts, and work together to proceed. Then, Yang Yongtai gave a speech, stating that this bandit suppression by the Commander-in-Chief is different from formal warfare. The bandits are different from formal troops. When the troops come, the bandits go; when the troops leave, the bandits come. Therefore, we must rely on political forces to maintain the recovered bandit areas and prevent them from falling into the hands of the bandits again. Those who are responsible for administrative responsibility, although there are the National Government and the Provincial Government above, the direct implementing agency is the county government. Therefore, the position and responsibility of the county magistrate are very important. The Commander-in-Chief said in his speech the other day that the county magistrate is an "official who is close to the people," that is, what was previously called the parent of the people. What we hope from you is to make good use of political forces and work hard on bandit suppression. Now, from the central government to the local level, everyone must use their full spirit to deal with bandit suppression. You should pay attention to the various items in Article 9 of the organizational regulations of the Party and Government Committee, but the most important are three points: (1) To actively organize the masses; (2) To strengthen self-defense forces; (3) To complete the tools for bandit suppression. After the above three points are completed, not only will village cleansing and bandit suppression be easier to carry out, but it will also be easier to start post-war reconstruction. Then, Qiu gave a speech, saying that to reorganize the local militias, we must have a unified understanding, that is, the party headquarters and the government must also have a unified examination. He also said that the local militias must implement Baojia system and check household registrations as a basic work, so as to avoid complexity and be susceptible to the propaganda and enticement of the communist bandits. After the speech, the meeting was adjourned. They had lunch at the Provincial Government. At 2:00 p.m., the meeting continued. Except for the members of the Party and Government Committee who were on leave, the number of attendees was the same as before. Xia Douyin was still the chairman and designated the Director of the Construction Department, Li Shucheng, to report on the various items decided at the Lushan Conference, and the Construction Department formulated in detail the points that should be implemented based on the Lushan Conference. Then, all the county magistrates made four requests to the chairman for instructions, and Xia answered them one by one. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m., and it was decided that the second meeting would continue at 8:00 a.m. on the 15th, after which it would be closed.</p>
<p>The three items of Chiang's handwritten instructions to the county magistrates and the ten questions issued to the county magistrates for reply are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A. Three items of handwritten instructions to the county magistrates: (1) Articles 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14 of our party and government's domestic policy are all policies that are most easy to implement in the bandit areas of the counties. If we cannot vigorously implement this policy, then the communist bandits in Hubei will definitely bring disaster to the country and harm it endlessly. I hope that the county magistrates will implement these seven policies to the best of their ability and encourage themselves morning and evening to ensure that they are implemented. (2) To organize various local militias and manage Baojia, it is necessary to take household registration as the basic condition. If household registration cannot be checked clearly, then the various organizations and movements of village cleansing will be ineffective. Therefore, I hope that the county magistrates must personally supervise and check the household registration by rotation. If there are any false or unclear things, the person in charge must be severely punished. The punishment will be imprisonment for minor offenses and execution for major offenses. (3) During the bandit suppression period, everyone in the agencies, starting with the county magistrate, must be militarized. In terms of affairs, such as education and various professions, they must all be militarized. The people in the countryside must be militarized even more. The county magistrates should set a monthly plan for this. For example, within a month, how many villages can have a few thousand or a few hundred people who can be organized and trained for militarization, so that within half a year or a year, how many percent of the people in the whole county can be militarized. By carrying out this way according to schedule, personally supervising and testing, even if it is not as complete as the planned plan, there must be considerable results. Currently, the county magistrates who are handling affairs are suffering from the lack of plans, lack of schedules, and lack of numbers.</p>
<p>B. Questions issued to the county magistrates for reply: (1) Has the household registration of the county been compiled and checked? What month and year was it held? How many households are there? How many people are there? Is this compilation and check accurate, or is it still roughly estimated? What is the compilation and check method based on? Have there been any changes in household registration due to repeated bandit disturbances recently? What is the situation? (2) How many districts are there in the county according to past practice or the current system? Where is the center of the district? (That is, the location of the district office) What are the names of the important towns and villages under the jurisdiction of the district? Is the current district system in line with reality? Are the names of the district towns and villages all used, or are the names of the district forts, capitals, regiments, and armors still used? Below the district, for handling local self-defense or autonomous affairs, is there any existing organization? What is the level and method of its organization? Is this existing organization effective? What is the actual situation? How has the funding for local self-defense and autonomy in the county been obtained in the past? What is the actual situation? (The above questions should be answered separately in simple tables with diagrams) (3) Has the Baojia system been implemented in the county? Is it handled according to the current system or following the old practice? How should the Baojia system in the county be reorganized and implemented in the future? Are there any opinions? (4) Does the county have a local security team? (Or similar to a security team under a different name) Are there police? What is the organizational system? How is its funding obtained? How many people are there? How many firearms are there? And where is the current location? Are there any opinions on the reorganization and training of the county's security team or police? (5) Does the county have local group defenses, teams, and all organizations for people's self-defense? (Such as the Security Corps, the Strong Men Corps, or the Communist Eradication Volunteer Army, etc.) What is the method and actual situation of its organization? Are there any opinions on the planning and training of the people's self-defense organization in the county in the future? (6) What are the names of the officers of the local security team and group defense team, etc.? Are each of them effective? (7) Does the county have city walls? Are they complete and solid? Are there any fortresses, blockhouses, and all buildings for concentrated population equipment and defensive works in the county's towns and villages? How should the county build fortresses and blockhouses in the future, and how should they be implemented selectively by district? Are there any opinions? (8) Does the county have joint defense communication and all electric wire and telephone equipment? Are there any highways that can be used by cars? How should the county's highways be repaired and connected in the future? (That is, connected with the main roads passing through the county) Are there any opinions? (9) What is the past and present situation of the county's suffering from bandits and disturbances? What is the general economic situation of the county's rural areas? What is the county's financial situation? (10) How should the method of bandit suppression and village cleansing in each county be handled to be effective? Each should state practical and feasible opinions. (July 14)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Xu's Troops Recapture Huo Qiu <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Xu Tingyao Enters the City to Handle Post-War Affairs</p>
<p>The Remaining Bandits are Being Searched and Suppressed</p>
<p>A dispatch from Bengbu reports that Huo Qiu, located in a remote area of western Anhui bordering Henan, has been a bandit-ridden area in its southwestern regions for a long time. It has been occupied by bandits since May 15th, nearly two months ago. The bandit leader Kuang Jixun led the 21st and 25th puppet armies to ravage the local area, causing immense suffering. Xu Tingyao, commander of the First Column of the Right Route Army for Bandit Suppression, led the Fourth Division and the Independent 40th Brigade under Song Shike from Zhengyang to attack Huo Qiu last month, capturing key passes in succession. He then surrounded Huo Qiu. The bandits built defensive works in the city, relying on the terrain to resist stubbornly. According to intelligence from the front, the battle was extremely fierce at noon on the 12th. Although the bandits in the southern countryside of Huo Qiu repeatedly sent reinforcements, they were ultimately unable to succeed because their rear was cut off by the bandit suppression army. The First Aviation Team, stationed in Bengbu and Hefei, dispatched planes in shifts to fly over Huo Qiu city and drop 35-pound bombs on the bandits, killing countless Red bandits defending the city. By the afternoon, Xu's troops had broken through the main force of Kuang's bandits. At 6 p.m., they surrounded the remaining bandits, making it impossible for them to escape. They eventually killed 2,000 bandits, captured 3,000, and seized hundreds of machine guns and mortars, as well as countless rifles. It is said that Kuang was also injured and may be among the prisoners. It is also reported that a puppet Soviet chairman and several puppet regimental commanders were captured. The remaining bandits are currently being searched and suppressed. Xu Tingyao entered Huo Qiu city at 7 a.m. (the 13th). Important military organs here have received Xu's victory report. After Xu's troops recaptured Huo Qiu, they are now planning post-war affairs and are strictly preventing the Red bandits from making a comeback. The post-war measures include: (1) Issuing good citizen certificates to residents who surrender in areas under government control; (2) Issuing return-home certificates to disaster victims in bandit areas and ordering troops to protect them; (3) Providing substantial support to local self-defense militias; (4) Implementing strict blockade of bandit areas to cut off transportation; those who are evil people who have contact with bandits will be shot immediately; (5) Conducting census and implementing rural cleanup; (6) Building roads with engineering corps to facilitate transportation and benefit military operations.

<h3 id="e96">Second Tragedy for Bengbu Aircraft <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Fighter Plane Crashes into Barracks After Takeoff</p>
<p>Plane Crashes, Catches Fire, Bullets and Bombs Explode</p>
<p>Two Pilots Killed, Seventeen Soldiers Injured</p>
<p>A dispatch from Bengbu reports that during the Fourth Division Commander Xu Tingyao's attack on Huo Qiu, the First Aviation Team stationed in Bengbu and Hefei also dispatched planes to the bandit area to assist in reconnaissance and bombing, achieving remarkable success. On the morning of the 13th, aviation pilot Chen Guannan, believing that Huo Qiu had been recaptured but that most of the bandits were still between Hongjiaji, Yulinpu, and Sanliuji, dropped ten bombs on new fortifications of the bandits at Pokangkou. He then flew back to Bengbu and reported on the capture of Huo Qiu. At 3:40 p.m., he and Wang Baoting, a mechanic from his team, piloted a No. 103 Douglas aircraft, carrying two machine guns and six 35-pound bombs, intending to fly to Huo Qiu and Liu'an to deliver mailbags and drop bombs and shoot at Yulinpu. However, when taking off from the Xiaoshan South Airfield, there was a strong and turbulent southwest wind. The south side of the airfield also had troops drilling. The plane was pulled up off the ground too early, with insufficient speed, and encountered a strong wind blowing from the right wing, causing it to turn to the left and lose speed. The plane tilted and crashed violently into the west end of the Dongyi Barracks. As soon as it crashed, the plane caught fire, and the gasoline burned fiercely. The Dongyi Barracks was garrisoned by the Wang and Tan Regiments of the 25th Brigade of the Ninth Division. Tan's regiment had just finished drilling, and many guards and orderlies were still in the barracks. When the crowd saw the plane crash, they rushed to draw water and fight the fire, while others approached to watch. However, the bombs attached to the wings were ignited by the fire and suddenly four exploded, with a deafening sound. All 500 rounds of machine gun bullets exploded at the same time, instantly injuring seventeen soldiers of the Wang Regiment. Aviation pilot Chen and mechanic Wang were burned, then suffered a terrible explosion, their bodies blown to pieces and reduced to ashes along with the plane, a sight too horrible to bear. When the plane crashed, the continuous explosions of the bombs made the citizens unable to understand the situation, and they suspected a fire. The police bell on Bengbu Mountain also rang loudly. The entire fire brigade of the Public Security Bureau rushed to the rescue upon hearing the news. After the investigation, only the iron shell of the plane remained, and the cylinder was blown several feet away. Under the iron shell, there were still two unexploded bombs. The two machine guns on the plane had been destroyed. Yan Yucong, captain of the First Aviation Team, also came to inspect the scene, but did not dare to retrieve the unexploded bombs. He sent someone to photograph the plane shell for reporting. The names of the soldiers of the 50th Regiment who were injured by the explosion are listed below: Li Jianshu, injured in the left leg and right tibia; Fan Zhendong, injured in the right leg and left tibia; Huang Bin, injured in the back; Zhang Wenzhi, injured in the left tibia; Chen Debiao, injured in the face.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Huang Youxing, injured in the right cheek and back; Yang Ru Xue, injured in the right wrist; Wang Xi, injured in the right shoulder; Wu Jiaxiu, injured in the neck; Ren Zhi, injured in the abdomen and left breast; Xue Jianji, injured in the right arm; Huang Jinhuo, injured in the face; Zhang Jisheng, injured in the left tibia; Li Kongfu, injured in the left arm; Wang Zai, injured in the left tibia; Liu Peilin, injured in the head; Gu Huarong, injured in the leg. All seventeen were injured by fragments of bomb shells. However, Wang Zaichao, Wu Jiaxiu, and Ren Zhilan were more seriously injured and may be in danger of death. They have been sent to the Army Hospital for treatment, while the rest are being treated by the health team in this regiment. It is reported that earlier this month, an accident involving a plane from this team resulted in 50 to 60 casualties. This Douglas aircraft, which was burned and exploded, was purchased for 100,000 yuan and destroyed in an instant, so the loss was also very significant. (July 13th)</p>

A large dog suddenly ran out and barked at the officers. The dog's owner, Lu Guanshou, came out to chase the dog and verbally insulted the officers. The officers refused to accept this. At that time, Lu Gentu and Zhu Zhifan came out to mediate, but the officers still refused and severely beat the three men. At this time, more and more neighbors gathered in the village and made things difficult for the officers, even leading to a brawl. Seeing the large number of villagers, the officers returned to the team headquarters and, together with all the officers, went to the village armed and arrested more than ten people, including Lu Guanshou, and took them to the team headquarters. Lu Guanshou, Lu Gentu, and Zhu Zhifan were tied up and beaten with iron bars. Lu and Zhu each lost an eye, their leg bones were broken, and they suffered serious injuries to their waists.

<p>Scorching Weather and Rampant Tiger Cholera: The weather in Xiyi has suddenly become hot in the past three days, and tiger cholera is rampant in the city and countryside, spreading rapidly, which is alarming. It is most common among women and laborers. The day before yesterday, in Donghetou Lane in the city, a total of eleven men and women died of tiger cholera in one day. More than a hundred people a day come to various hospitals for treatment. If preventive measures are not taken soon, the epidemic may spread even more severely, which is frightening. By the evening, residents inside and outside the city were sleeping in the open air, and the streets were full of people. Prisoners in the prisons also died of heat stroke from time to time. County Chief Chen Chuande specially convened a disease prevention meeting of various organs and groups at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 15th) to discuss all preventive measures.</p>

<p>A Homicide Occurs During a Play in the Eighth District: A Qingmiao Opera was performed in Jiaxu, Puren Township, Eighth District of Wuyi the other day. Unexpectedly, a fight broke out among the villagers in the theater, injuring many spectators. Subsequently, Cheng Yuanliang and Yin Shenghuo went missing. After searching everywhere without success, a floating corpse was suddenly discovered near the Bian Dan River Car Road Bridge on the morning of the 12th. Yin's father, Bu Qing, went to identify it and confirmed that it was his son, Shenghuo, and that his body was covered with wounds and blood stains. It was assumed that he had been beaten to death and his body dumped into the river. He filed a report with the County Court on the 14th. Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongxi immediately led police officers and clerks to the countryside to investigate.</p>

<p>Large Amount of Gold and Silver Smuggled and Confiscated: Zhengtianchang Company of Huaining County, Anhui, previously entrusted Taikoo Anqing Shipping to transport 24 bars of red gold, weighing 200 taels, and 21 silver bars, weighing 207 taels, and 46 silver ingots, weighing 501 taels, to Dafeng Hengjin Company in Shanghai. When the ship arrived in Zhenjiang, it was discovered by Zhenjiang Customs, which suspected it was being smuggled out and confiscated it. After various parties proved that it was not being smuggled but that the export time was rushed and customs declaration had not been made, they requested that the Customs release it. It is now reported that the Customs will impose a discretionary penalty for the illegal smuggling of silver bars and silver ingots and allow their return. However, the smuggled gold bars will be detained in accordance with the regulations and, in accordance with the orders of the Ministry, will be awarded to the public as ordinary smuggled goods.</p>

<p>Central Bank Robbed in Broad Daylight: At 12:00 p.m. today (the 14th), five bandits wearing summer cloth and silk long gowns, speaking with a local accent, suddenly came to the Central Bank on Zuojie in this city. They entered the bank under the pretense of exchanging small bills. However, as they entered, two bandits drew pistols and restrained the bank's petitioning police Zhang Qingfang and Liu, threatening them to remain silent. The other three bandits reportedly entered the vault and robbed 20 yuan in silver and 56 yuan in banknotes. They then left and openly walked through the streets with their guns. The Public Security Bureau's First Precinct learned of the incident. Precinct Chief Liao personally led dozens of officers and, at the same time, telegraphed the County Government Public Security Bureau and various sub-stations, ordering the police force and detectives to pursue and arrest the bandits in separate groups and to strictly investigate hotels and bathhouses. A suspect was captured in Xiaojiajing. The other perpetrators have all escaped.</p>
<p>Chief Prosecutor of the Court Changes: Zhu Ronggui, Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangdu County Local Branch Court, was yesterday ordered by the High Court to be transferred to the position of Judge of the Shanghai Local Branch Court.

<p>Public Security Bureau Requests Levy of Passenger Tax: The Nantong County Public Security Bureau requested the levy of a passenger tax due to a shortage of funds.

<p>Daxi Wheel Hits a Reef and is Damaged: The Daxi Wheel, loaded with 24,000 packages of salt from Haizhou, was sailing to Yangzhou to unload and deliver them to the Gongji Salt Warehouse when it hit a reef near the Eleven Pier Port of Nantong and ran aground. The bottom of the front cabin was cracked for about three feet, and river water poured in, completely dissolving the salt it contained. Water also entered the middle cabin. In order to raise the ship's hull, some salt packages were also discarded. The salt carried by the ship must be taxed after reaching the Twelve Pier. Because of the accident, a report was submitted to the Lianghuai Salt Transport Envoy's Office and the Yangzhou Audit Branch Office for inspection. On the 14th, Commissioner Xie from Yangyu Warehouse and Commissioner Jian from Yangzhou Audit Branch Office, together with Zhou Jianfu, Chairman of the Nantong Salt Merchants Association, went to inspect. It was estimated that the front and middle cabins suffered a total loss of more than 6,000 packages of salt. Although the patching of the leak in the bottom of the Daxi Wheel's cabin was completed, it was stuck in the muddy beach and had to unload the salt packages before it could drive out of danger.</p>

<p>The Scramble for Rice Expands in Huzhou: Since the autumn floods of last year, farmers in various counties of Huzhou have been on the verge of starvation. Coupled with the famine in the spring and summer of this year, the villagers are even more impoverished. Therefore, there have been incidents of rice grabbing recently. Incidents have been occurring continuously in Wuhu, Shuanglin, Lianshi, and Wuzhen. Recently, it has spread to Luoshe in Deqing. Yesterday, a rice merchant from Shanshi transported more than a hundred piculs of white rice to Lianshi. Suddenly, halfway through, the rice was robbed completely. The town reported this to the county government by telephone. The county sent a police team and detectives to maintain order and also sent a team from the First Regiment of the Security Corps to suppress the incident. It is reported that seven rice robbers have been captured.</p>

<p>A Water Fight Ensues Over Seized Boats: The troops of Dai, the 36th Brigade of the Lu Army stationed in Pinghu, were ordered to defend the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. The brigade headquarters was relocated to Jiaxing, and the brigade headquarters entrusted the county Public Security Bureau to seize civilian boats for transportation. Unexpectedly, about dozens of boats anchored in Donghu suddenly cut their mooring ropes and fled together. The Public Security Bureau police learned of this and quickly drove boats to chase after them, shouting for them to stop. The boatmen openly resisted and used boat poles to beat the police. The police also used bamboo poles to fight back. As a result, in addition to recovering a few boats, the rest were escaped.</p>

<p>Victims of Economic Oppression: In recent years, due to economic hardship, suicides among people in the countryside have been occurring from time to time. On the 13th, a man from Ningbo hired a boat to Qianjiang and suddenly jumped into the Qianjiang River to commit suicide. His body has not yet been recovered. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 14th, a farmer surnamed Sha from Xixing also committed suicide by drowning because his family could not make a living. In Langyu, Xixing, there was a resident named Yu A Yuan who worked as a foreman in a hosiery factory in Hangzhou. He usually liked gambling and would not hesitate to spend a thousand gold pieces. Now, because he was dismissed as a foreman, he could not maintain his family's livelihood and suddenly had the idea of giving up on life. On the night of the 13th, he secretly consumed two bowls of salt in the kitchen and died. His wife, Chen, believing that there was no money for a coffin and burial after her husband's death, also hanged herself on the morning of the 14th.</p>

<p>Recent Distribution of Free Education in Various Counties of Jiangsu</p>
<p>The Sparsest is in the Huai Area, with One School for Every 200 Square Li</p>
<p>The Densest is in Qingpu, Chuansha, and Jiangyin, with One School for Every Eight or Nine Square Li</p>
<p>The Joint Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education in Various Counties of Jiangsu has always been praised by all parties for its accurate statistics and rapid timing in the investigation and statistics of compulsory education. Since the founding of the Republic, the office has prepared statistical tables of the implementation of free education in all counties, which have been distributed to the counties and reported to the Ministry of Education and the Department of Education for comparison and progress. The Ministry of Education also forwarded them to various provinces and cities for reference and imitation. Now that the 20th year has just ended, the office has completed the preparation of various statistics on compulsory education in various counties during that year. The following is a preliminary excerpt of the comparison of the area of each county occupied by primary schools (including the primary department of primary schools), which can be used to measure the density of compulsory education distribution.</p>

<p>(Explanation) (1) The number of schools in counties marked with "X" is calculated based on the statistics of the 19th year. (2) The area of each county is based on the latest investigation and records of the Department of Civil Affairs. (3) The area is in square li. Decimals less than one square li are not used. (4) The primary departments of complete primary schools are also included in the number of primary schools.</p>
<p>(Research) (1) From the above statistics, it can be seen that among the 61 counties in Jiangsu, the average area occupied by each primary school is less than 10 square li in 5 counties, less than 20 square li in 11 counties, less than 50 square li in 21 counties, less than 100 square li in 12 counties, and between 100 and 300 square li in 12 counties. (2) If 9 square li is the standard for a primary school district, then only two counties in the province have achieved universal primary education, three counties are close to universal primary education, and the remaining counties are mostly more than twice the 9-square-li standard, with the highest being more than 30 times (that is, taking 9 square li as the standard for establishing a primary school, two or more than 30 times as many primary schools still need to be added). (3) Under these circumstances, in order to seek the average development of compulsory education in all counties of the province, what kind of policies should the provincial and county educational administrations adopt, and what kind of efforts should be made to achieve success? This is a major issue that can be studied. (4) At present, the funding for compulsory education in various counties is difficult and tight, so it is difficult to expand step by step until there is an increase in funding. (5) Whether the method of distribution and the setting of school districts in the primary schools already established in various counties, regardless of their density, are all based on a thorough and overall plan for the entire county is closely related to the efficiency of primary schools in the promotion of compulsory education. This is also a major issue that can be studied.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Labor University Students Actively Protect the School <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Another Telegram Sent Nationwide Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the petition by Labor University students Gao Zong and others, although the Executive Yuan responded with a temporary closure and referred the restoration plan to the Ministry of Education for deliberation, as reported previously, the Ministry of Education has not responded to the students' submission and petition. The Executive Yuan's referral of the restoration plan to the ministry has also not yielded a response. The Labor University School Protection Committee believes that the Ministry of Education lacks sincerity and intends to sabotage the school. It has sent a telegram nationwide, stating that the students will continue to protect the school with their original determination and requesting assistance from all sectors. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>To newspaper offices, forwarded to the national public: Labor University is unfortunate, repeatedly subjected to violent destruction. Since the Ministry of Education ordered the school to stop enrollment in the 19th year, there has been the tragedy of forced dissolution. Recently, taking advantage of the destruction from the Japanese bombardment, the Ministry suddenly ordered the school to close. Although the Executive Yuan responded to the students, stating that it was a temporary closure and referred the "Outline for the Development of Labor Education and Reorganization of Labor University" to the Ministry of Education for deliberation, the Ministry ignores opposition from all sides and insists on implementing its plan to close Labor University since the 19th year. It has not shown any intention of adopting the founder's restoration plan or the students' petition. Our committee is determined to oppose this consistent policy of destroying labor education. Unless the government makes a clear statement that Labor University will continue to exist, our committee will continue the school protection movement with its original determination, and will not stop until our goal is achieved. We earnestly hope that the national public will rise up and assist us. National Labor University Student School Protection Committee, bowed. You.</p>

<p>The National Higher Education Problem Discussion Conference began yesterday at 9:00 AM at the meeting hall on the 9th floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Around six or seventy representatives from various regions registered. Representatives from Jiaotong University, Xiamen University, Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, and Wuchang China University were elected to the presidium. Lu Lin-Sun of Fudan University was the recorder. First, the chairman of the preparatory committee, Jiaotong University President Li Zhao-Huan, reported on the preparation process. Shanghai University President Liu Zhan-En delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the Shanghai Universities Federation. Xu Pei-Huang, Director of the Education Bureau, spoke on behalf of the Municipal Government. Hu Shu-Hua, President of Tongji University, reported on his participation in the National University President Conference in Beijing. Subsequently, Chen Shi of Wuchang China University, Sun Gui-Ding of Xiamen University, Huang Shi-Jin of Zhijiang College of Arts and Sciences, Yang Yong-Qing of Soochow University, and Ms. Wu Yi-Fang of Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences reported on the situations of their respective schools. A group photo was taken. The meeting continued at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Details of each item will be recorded below.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Continued Representatives: Yesterday, the following representatives continued to arrive: Zhang Yun of the Medical College of National Central University, Yan Fu (represented by Zhao Yun-Wen), Chen Xuan-Shan of Great China University, Tang Wei-Zhi of Wuxi National Studies College (represented by Qian Ji-Bo), Chu Fu-Cheng and Shen Jun-Ru of Shanghai Law College, Zhang Su-Min and Xu Pei-Kun of the School of Commerce of National Central University, Wang Jing-Qi, Wang Er, Hong Shao-Liu, Chen Zhen, and Wang Cheng-Yin of National Labor University, He Shi-Mei, He Shi-Mo, and Gu Ke-Jian of Chi Chih College, Ma Wen-Chuo of Yenching University, and others. Additionally, Li Shu-Tian is a representative of Jiaotong University (mistakenly reported as Tangshan College of Engineering yesterday).</p>
<p>Report on Preparations: Yun Li Zhao-Huan reported on the preparations, saying: "Today, the Higher Education Problem Discussion Conference opens. I would like to briefly report on the preparation process. After the September 18th Incident and the crisis in the Northeast, colleagues in the Shanghai education sector felt that the issue of education saving the nation was extremely important. This spring, the Songhu War suddenly broke out, making the relationship between education and the country and society even more urgent. Various issues must be discussed in detail in order to find appropriate solutions and effective measures. Therefore, we initiated the Higher Education Problem Discussion Conference, seeking opinions from presidents of universities, independent colleges, and vocational schools across the country, as well as education experts. The majority supported it, so we are holding a meeting in Shanghai this morning to discuss these issues together. This is a brief overview of the preparation process. I have three hopes for this conference: (1) How should the problems within universities themselves be improved? (2) How should we unite in the future to study the issues of China's survival and the work we should be doing? (3) I hope that the results of this conference can be adopted step by step. The conference will last for three days, which is short, but the issues discussed are very important. Please discuss them in detail, adopting the strengths and discarding the weaknesses, to truly benefit the country and society."</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Delivers Welcome Speech: Yun, Mr. Liu Zhan-En of Shanghai University delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Today, the Shanghai Universities Federation sincerely welcomes representatives from universities outside Shanghai. The weather is so hot, our hearts are even hotter. We are very sorry because we originally proposed to hold the conference last year, but it was not possible due to the September 18th and January 28th incidents and the national crisis. We must thoroughly reform higher education. Many universities are large but unlearned, and some are not large and unlearned. Now we are studying the current situation. What methods should we use to reform higher education? I would like to share my personal views with you: (1) The issue of students' career paths. What is the mission of universities? Currently, students are studying what they will not use and using what they did not study, or not studying or using at all. How should we solve this problem? (2) The issue of curriculum and teaching materials. Currently, there are very few practical textbooks in the country. How can we make teaching materials and textbooks more practical? (3) The issue of teaching methods, that is, the study of the current credit system and academic year system. (4) The issue of moral education. We must earnestly study this issue because many student movements are related to moral education. (5) The issue of funding. National universities are relatively well-funded, but private universities are not. My opinion is that as long as we stop the civil war, there will be a solution. Moreover, the cost of university students is supported by the countryside. How can the 18th-century rural economy support the 20th-century consumption of universities? (6) The issue of faculty. Currently, there are very few people who are truly educating for the sake of education. We must truly educate for the sake of education. I am raising so many questions that cannot be solved in just two or three days. We need long-term unity. We should look at this issue with both a microscope and a telescope, and then the problem will naturally be easily solved."</p>
<p>Xu Pei-Huang's Speech: Today, I am very honored to represent Mayor Wu at the Higher Education Problem Discussion Conference. Regarding the current state of higher education in our country, according to what I have heard, students often register at a certain school and then send a representative to attend classes. This bad system should be corrected. Furthermore, students should focus on practical knowledge and avoid arrogance, thinking that they can do anything after graduating from university. In reality, when they leave school and enter society to find work, they cannot meet the needs of society. If students have ambition and can focus on scientific research, they may become China's Edison or Ford in the future. You are gathered here today to study and discuss the reform of higher education problems, and I am sure that you will have good results and contributions.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Conference Resolutions: The meeting continued at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, chaired by Li Zhao-Huan and Chen Shi. The resolutions are recorded below: (1) Regarding the issue of promoting education (including moral education), (1) The proposal by Wuchang China University that university students should focus on moral education and self-cultivation was resolved to be changed to "Universities should focus on student life guidance," which will be drafted by the Organizing Committee and then submitted to the conference again. (2) The proposal by Jiaotong University to unify the courses taught by part-time faculty at various schools to focus on research areas and increase teaching effectiveness was withdrawn by the proposer.

<h3 id="e124">International Radio Station Sends Telegram to Minister of Communications <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Opposing the Secret Contract with Mackay Company</p>
<p>According to the Kuo Wen News Agency, the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications, in order to oppose the secret contract with the American Mackay Company, sent a telegram to Minister Huang, which read: "To Minister Huang Junjian of the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, it has been widely rumored among Chinese and foreign communications circles that your ministry secretly signed a Sino-American wireless telegraph service contract, a Sino-American wireless telephone contract, and a contract to purchase five telephone machines with the American Mackay Company at the end of last month. The motives and conditions are sufficient to endanger China's newly independent international communications business. Due to the complexity of the internal situation, the person in charge of handling the matter strictly kept it secret during the negotiation, and kept it even more secret after the signing. Not only did the colleagues in the national telecommunications industry have no knowledge of it, but even the Telecommunications Department, which is in charge of national telecommunications affairs, did not understand the inside story. If this news is true, it is greatly alarming. All of us have worked hard to participate in the movement to recover China's international communications autonomy in the past four years, and the pioneering construction of the International Radio Station has been completed. We share the hardships and are extremely concerned about it. With a sense of crisis in our hearts, it is difficult to remain silent. We hereby present the foreseeable drawbacks after the signing of the various contracts in detail to your Excellency: (A) Regarding the Sino-American telegraph service contract, (1) Deliberately creating international disputes and damaging China's foreign reputation. According to the matter of opening wireless telegraph services between China and the United States, the Chinese government and the American Wireless Radio Corporation signed a telegraph service contract in November of the 17th year of the Republic of China, with a term of ten years. Section 2 of the contract states, "The Corporation shall transmit all telegrams within its jurisdiction, whether sent to China or relayed by China, through the above-mentioned wireless circuits, unless the sender specifies the routing..." Section 3 states, "The Chinese government shall transmit all telegrams within its jurisdiction, whether sent to the United States or relayed by the United States, through the above-mentioned wireless circuits, unless the sender specifies the routing..."</p>
<p>Article 11 states, "Both parties shall be free to enter into wireless telegraph service contracts with other countries, but shall not violate the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of this contract." Section 10 states, "...If the two parties cannot reconcile or resolve disputes over this contract, the disputes shall be submitted to arbitration...Both parties shall be obliged to abide by the decision of the dispute if it is unanimously or overwhelmingly supported by the arbitrator...All arbitration costs shall be borne by the losing party..." It is now found that this contract has only been in effect for one year and seven months since it began to be implemented. However, our side suddenly violated the provisions of Article 11 of the contract and signed another contract with the Mackay Company. Using the means of burying bones like a fox to apply it to domestic laws and regulations is enough to invite the slander of an unorganized country. Now it deliberately disregards the constraints of international contracts, knowing that it will inevitably pay for arbitration in the future, and knowing that it will inevitably be in a losing position during arbitration, but it still does so recklessly. What is its deep intention? We don't need to ask, but where will it place our national personality and foreign reputation? Last year, Czechoslovakia was once fooled by the Mackay Company and violated the contract of the joint venture company and signed another telegraph service contract with it. Later, the joint venture company submitted it to arbitration, and the Czech Republic completely failed. The Mackay contract was revoked. The precedent is not far away. Why should our country repeat the same mistakes and bring trouble upon itself? Some say that the person in charge of signing this contract did not consider this. The Mackay Company has issued another statement, undertaking to bear all the responsibilities of losing the arbitration in the future. We sincerely hope that this rumor is not true, because the minds of those in power in our country are not so childish, and the Mackay Company will not use such improper means in the international community to try to expand its business. But if this news is true, then the business ethics of Mackay are another question. However, it regards the government authorities of our country as children, and regards our country's international contracts as child's play, which is inevitably a loss of face for our country. (2) Self-destruction of international telecommunications business and reduction of reporting efficiency. According to the Mackay Company, it originally belonged to the International Telegraph and Telephone Company (I·T·T) system. In China, the organization belonging to the system, the Pacific Water Line Company, the Shanghai Concession Telephone Company, and the Pacific Water Line have monopolized the telecommunications business between China and the United States for decades. It is the backbone organization that infringes upon China's foreign communications sovereignty. After the expiration of the final contract the year before last, our government negotiated to recover the landing rights, which caused a so-called water line negotiation for a while. The company finally relied on its cunning tricks to make the negotiation situation fully complicated, so that it is still a pending case. However, since the completion of the International Radio Station and the opening of the Sino-American wireless circuit, its arrogance has been slightly diminished. Now, if the Mackay contract is established, the two companies will no longer compete in business due to their relationship under the same system. Naturally, the Pacific Water Line will be given the opportunity to pick up the pieces, and the number of reports from the Sino-American wireless circuit will inevitably be drastically reduced or even disappear. Its policy is no different from suicide. When the Chinese government signed a telegraph service contract with the joint venture company in the 17th year of the Republic of China, it carefully studied and investigated it. It finally concluded that the joint venture company and Western Union Telegraph Company are the most prosperous lines in the Americas, and they can maintain the heavy telegrams and deliver them. The reporting efficiency is the best. Therefore, it granted them the right to sign the Sino-American telegraph service contract. As for the Mackay Company, although PostalTekeguaph is used to forward its reports in the Americas, it can hardly use telegraph methods to forward them except in major cities. The low reporting efficiency can be imagined. In addition, due to the simultaneous business competition within PoslalTeleguaph, the drastic reduction or even disappearance of the number of incoming reports between China and the United States is also expected. The business achievements of the International Radio Station, which were created by the hard work of the majority, will be destroyed at once. Let the ambitious destroy the complete international transportation organization established in our country and revive its declining water line business. Is there anything in the world more painful and regrettable than this? (B) Regarding the Sino-American wireless telephone contract, (1) Giving ambitious people the opportunity to monopolize and invade. According to the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, it has long had a precise plan for the invasion of international Pacific telephone communications. After acquiring the Shanghai Concession Telephone Company, its terrible and vicious aggressive ambitions and tactics have been fully demonstrated in the construction of roads across borders and the promotion of business within the complete territory of our country. Now it is signing a Sino-American wireless telephone contract with it, and the scope has been expanded to the whole country. Although both parties are clearly aware that there is no hope for the development of international telephone services between China and the United States in the near future, for our side, this may be an opportunity to purchase a large number of unnecessary machines, while for the other side, it is because of this that it can achieve its dream of monopolizing China's international telephone communications for many years and unveil the prelude to its entire invasion plan. (C) Regarding the contract for ordering telephone machines, (1) It is not needed in the near future. According to international wireless telephone, it is one of the latest telecommunications businesses in the world. It has only been a few years since it was tested and opened for commercial use. However, due to the huge cost and high call charges, it has not yet reached a developed state even in Europe and the United States. Our country should catch up with the emerging businesses in international transportation, but due to the immaturity of industry and commerce, the backwardness of the economy, and the difference in day and night time between China and the United States, this business should only be used for preliminary application tests. Opening for commercial use is not yet the right time. Your ministry, in view of this, purchased telephone equipment when it recently ordered machines from the British Marconi Company to expand the London line and installed them in Shanghai to prepare for the opening of international wireless telephone. In terms of application needs, it is sufficient to meet the needs. As for the wireless telephone sets in Shanghai that are transferred to inland cities, your ministry has also ordered the directly affiliated electrical machinery factory to plan to manufacture them itself. According to estimates, the cost is only more than 10,000 yuan per set. If your ministry believes that this telephone line must be fully equipped at present, it only needs to order the manufacturing factory to rush to manufacture a few branch machines and install them in major cities, which will cost less than 100,000 yuan. In fact, it is enough to meet the full application. Why spend a huge amount of 2 million to build a bed and frame a house, which is not an urgent practical need for machinery? (2) Wasting international reporting fees, making it impossible for the International Radio Station to maintain itself. It is heard that the telephone machines purchased from the Mackay Company this time include a switchboard, priced at 600,000 yuan, and four branch machines, priced at 1.4 million yuan. At a time when the telecommunications budget is exhausted, the operating income of the International Radio Station must of course be used as a guarantee. According to the current operating income of the International Radio Station, it is ordered to be handed over to the Postal Remittance Bureau on a daily basis, designated as a reserve fund for repaying the loan from the Jiaotong Bank and the machine price of the German Fenggen Marconi Company. It is already difficult to make ends meet. Now, it is ordered to bear the price of 2 million telephone machines, which will inevitably lead to the monthly recurring expenses of the International Radio Station, which will not be able to maintain itself, and there will be no way to purchase maintenance materials. The livelihoods of employees are all exhausted, and the radio station's business will be suspended. The above points are all drawbacks that we believe can be foreseen after the contract is signed. Because it harms the country and the power, and traps our country's telecommunications in suicide, we do not hesitate to be verbose and ask for your wise judgment. As for this negotiation and signing of the contract to purchase machinery, it was carried out secretly by the person in charge during Minister Chen's sick leave. It was never made public. It was not reviewed by the Telecommunications Department, which is in charge of national telecommunications affairs, nor was the International Telecommunications Bureau, which is in charge of the country, allowed to contribute opinions, and no telecommunications experts were allowed to conduct research. In addition, the Mackay Company's attempt to sign this contract did not start today. The public condition was that after the contract was signed, a wireless telephone switchboard worth 600,000 yuan would be donated to the Chinese government. This is a fact that all colleagues in the telecommunications industry in our country know. However, in this negotiation and signing of the contract, the company did not fulfill its promise, and the switchboard was still sold to China for 600,000 yuan. Inevitably, it will greatly damage the reputation of your ministry. We are humble and should abide by the warning of not going beyond our position. However, we have personally participated in the difficulty of recovering our country's international communications sovereignty, so our care is greater than that of ordinary people. Even during the Shanghai war, the radio station was threatened by artillery fire and airplanes every day. We still risked our lives to maintain our country's foreign communications and swore to each other that as long as we had a breath, we would coexist with the radio station. This is the natural duty of every citizen, but it cannot be said that it is not driven by the idea of ​​caring for everything. Now, because we have witnessed the devastation of our country's foreign telecommunications business, felt the thorough criticism of public opinion from the outside, and suffered the blame from our conscience from the inside, we, at the beginning of your Excellency's term of office, do not avoid the axe and iron, and plan to ask for your strict attention and present our opinions. We request your Excellency to quickly investigate the inside story thoroughly. If the contract has been signed but has not been approved and filed by the Executive Yuan, please cancel it immediately to maintain the telecommunications administration and force national power. We are extremely eager to await orders. Respectfully, the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Song, Cai, and Yang Submitted Bail Again Yesterday in the Niu Lan Case <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Lawyers Requested Transfer of Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Chen Ying Went to Beijing to Personally Submit the Petition</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, after Niu Lan and his wife went on a hunger strike, Song Qingling and Cai Yuanpei jointly submitted bail to allow them to seek medical treatment outside. Later, Luo Wengan and Zheng Tianxi resigned, so they both withdrew their bail. Until yesterday, Song Qingling and Cai Yuanpei suddenly prepared bail again in Shanghai, and Yang Xingfo was added as a joint signatory. Lawyers Chen Ying and Feisi also submitted a petition to the court again yesterday, requesting a transfer of jurisdiction. Chen and others took the 11 o'clock night express train to Beijing last night to personally submit the petition to the Beijing court. The bail of Song, Cai, and Yang was also handed over to lawyer Chen to take to the Beijing court. Therefore, the Niu Lan case has undergone another sudden and major change. The news obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Submitted Bail for the Second Time Song and Cai have recently arrived in Shanghai one after another. Yesterday afternoon, Song, Cai, and Yang discussed the Niu Lan case again. As a result, they believed that Luo's resignation was not for the bail issue. Therefore, for the sake of maintaining humanity, they decided to continue to guarantee Niu Lan and his wife, and immediately wrote a bail, which was submitted to the Nanjing court.</p>
<p>Chen Fei Went to Beijing Yesterday The reporter visited lawyer Chen Ying and his secretary Shao Yuexu and learned that Chen and foreign lawyer Feisi also prepared a petition on behalf of Niu Lan and his wife yesterday, requesting the Supreme Court to transfer the case to the Shanghai branch court for continued trial. Lawyer Chen and Mr. Feisi took the night express train to Beijing at 11 o'clock last night to submit the petition. The bail of Song Qingling and others was also handed over to Mr. Chen to take to Beijing. It is expected to arrive in Beijing this morning.</p>
<p>Original Text of the Petition The lawyers Chen Ying and Feisi petitioned on behalf of Niu Lan and his wife to transfer jurisdiction to Shanghai. The original text is recorded as follows: For the matter of petitioning to transfer jurisdiction to Shanghai, the petitioners were first accepted by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in Shanghai according to law for the case of being interrogated for endangering the Republic of China. Later, for other reasons, it was changed to be accepted by the Jiangsu High Court. After petitioning to transfer to the Shanghai branch court, it was rejected by the ruling on the 11th of this month. The reason is that Article 22 of the Criminal Interrogation Law states that the competent court refers to the direct superior court in Article 21 of the same law. Therefore, this petition should be made to the Supreme Court. Under the guidance of the court, the petitioners should again request your court to transfer jurisdiction and state the reasons as follows: (1) According to Article 1 of the Implementing Conditions of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, "Those who commit crimes under the various articles of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China shall be governed by the High Court or its branch court in the first instance, unless otherwise specifically stipulated in this law and other laws." Based on this, it can be seen that if there is a branch court in the crime area, the branch court should manage it in principle. Only when there is no branch court in the crime area should the High Court manage it. If the High Court tries all cases regardless of whether there is a branch court or not, then the four words "or its branch court" are not just for show. (2) According to Article 13 of the Criminal Trial Law, "The territorial jurisdiction of the court shall be determined according to the place of the crime or the domicile, residence, or location of the defendant." The suspected place of the crime and the domicile, residence, and location of the defendant in this case are all within the Shanghai Public Concession, which is under the jurisdiction of the Second Branch of the High Court. (3) According to Article 21 of the Criminal Trial Law, "If the court cannot exercise jurisdiction over the law or facts, or if there are special circumstances that may hinder public security or cause unfairness in the trial, the direct superior court shall transfer the case to another court of the same level as the original court within its jurisdiction." When this case was accepted by the First Branch of the High Court, there were none of the above-mentioned circumstances, and there was no question of transferring jurisdiction at all. The reason for the transfer of jurisdiction at that time was not due to the ruling of the superior court, but due to the request of the military authorities, which was obviously a special reason. Since the military authorities have recognized that they have no jurisdiction, they should immediately restore the original state and send it back to the original trial court for continued acceptance, which is legal. Now it is under the jurisdiction of the High Court, which is not only inconsistent with the principles of law, but also inconvenient for both the court and the defendant in fact, because Beijing and Shanghai are far apart and it takes time to travel back and forth, such as the summoning of witnesses, the investigation of evidence, and the various required procedures such as exercising appraisal and on-site inspection. According to Article 2 of the Criminal Trial Law, "Public officials who implement the criminal trial procedure shall pay attention to both the favorable and unfavorable circumstances of the defendant in the matters under their jurisdiction." It is necessary to transfer it to the Shanghai branch court for continued acceptance. Moreover, the Shanghai branch court does not mean that it has no legal right to accept it. However, due to the circumstances at the time, the defendant had to be handed over to the military authorities, and the trial procedure of this case was temporarily suspended. As for the detention in Beijing, it was originally because the Shanghai war broke out and the distance between Suzhou and Shanghai was close, and there was a risk, so the defendant was sent to Beijing for temporary detention, which was also one of the special circumstances. Now, the military authorities have recognized that they have no jurisdiction, and the Shanghai war has long stopped, and there is no dangerous situation. Then the special reasons that were considered at that time have all disappeared, and there is no need to be detained in Beijing and tried by the High Court. According to law and fact, it should be returned to the Shanghai branch court for continued trial. The petitioner is a literary scholar and his physique was not very strong. After being detained for more than a year, he has suffered infinite hardships physically and felt great stimulation mentally. After repeatedly making legitimate requests and being repeatedly rejected, he is mentally disturbed and unable to comfort himself. He has no choice but to make a final cry of sorrow by going on a hunger strike. The court should pity and understand this kind of foolish and pitiful suffering, and should not regard it as an unreasonable threat. The defendant is not rejecting the jurisdiction of the Chinese court, but is recognizing the right conferred by law to be tried by a legitimate court in order to obtain the protection of Chinese law. Therefore, for the sake of law and humanity, it is appropriate to give the defendant an opportunity to facilitate him to exhaust his ability to attack and defend, so that even if the judgment is guilty, he can be willing to submit without any regrets. According to the provisions of Article 22 of the Criminal Trial Law, we respectfully request your court to consider and approve the transfer of jurisdiction and continue the trial by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in Shanghai according to law, so as to comply with the statutory procedures. It is a great convenience. As for other various reasons, they have been detailed in the petition submitted to the High Court on June 29, and please call the volume for review and merge the statement. Furthermore, the petitioners have been on a hunger strike since the 2nd of this month, which has lasted for more than two weeks. They are extremely exhausted and difficult to support. Although the court has sent personnel and defenders to persuade them in vain, they are heartbroken. We especially urge you to make a ruling as soon as possible and do not delay. We are extremely frightened and await orders. Respectfully, the Supreme Court, July 14, 21st year of the Republic of China, Petitioner Niu Lan Wang Deli Zeng, Attorney Chen Ying·Feisi.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Ma Yinchu Discusses the Abolition of Taels and the Adoption of the Yuan Currency <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The lack of uniformity in China's monetary system has long been a major problem for the social economy. The idea of reform has been advocated for a long time. However, due to the silver standard system being chaotic and unsystematic, it is neither a foreign standard nor a silver tael standard. It is neither fish nor fowl, which is deeply regrettable. Considering that a country's legal currency must be stipulated by law, this is not the case with China's silver taels. The purity and color are complex, and the divisions are made locally. Shanghai uses the "gui yuan," Tianjin uses the "xing hua," and Ping uses the "gong gu". As for the institutions, the Ministry of Finance uses the "ku ping", and the Customs uses the "guan ping." All of these are silver taels, which are sufficient to be cited as obstacles to the unification of the national currency, and the most powerful of these is the "gui yuan." If the "gui yuan" can be wiped out in one fell swoop, then the rest should not be a problem.</p>
<p>The motivation for this currency reform is a coincidence. On the one hand, it is due to the excessive confusion of currencies in the past. On the other hand, it is due to the sharp drop in the value of silver dollars, with a new low of six mace and eight fen. The reasons for the sharp drop in the value of silver dollars are no more than the following six: (1) the collapse of the rural economy, (2) the concentration of funds in cities, (3) the seasonal disorder of finance, (4) the decline of urban industry and commerce, (5) the huge storage of cash, and (6) the frequent banditry in the interior. As the market price of silver dollars has repeatedly fallen, it is better for those who hold silver dollars with a higher purity to melt them into silver, as it seems more profitable. This is because calculating the value as silver dollars is not cost-effective. Therefore, the smelting houses have been extremely busy recently, melting as many as 400,000 to 500,000 silver dollars every day. The remaining unmelted silver dollars are mostly second-rate silver dollars, and their purity may be uniform, which is of great benefit to the unification of the purity of silver dollars. There are many kinds of silver dollars. Those circulating in the market include the Mexican Eagle, the Daqing, the Jiangnan, the Beiyang, the Sun Yat-sen, the Yuan Shikai, and there are also Persian silver dollars and Hong Kong silver dollars, etc. The purity of these dollars is uneven. Now, if we abolish taels and adopt the yuan currency, unifying the currency system, the previous silver coins should be strictly regulated. Now, if we can melt away some of the impure silver dollars, we can gradually move towards consistency. The silver dollars currently used are made in the Hangzhou factory. The purity of its products is in line with the statutory requirements, but in terms of weight, there is a difference of 40 yuan for every 100,000 yuan. In the future, when the method of abolishing taels and adopting the yuan is implemented and the legal price of the new currency is determined, the silver dollars will be prepared for minting in Shanghai. This is because the Beijing factory site has been destroyed and the Hangzhou factory has a smaller scale. The Shanghai factory has the mechanical capacity to produce 500,000 silver dollars per day (more than 180 million yuan per year), and it also has machines for minting subsidiary coins, such as silver dimes and copper coins, etc., all of which can be operated by the Shanghai factory. In the future, the purity of the new currency will be 89%, weighing 7 mace and 2 fen in "ku ping," so each yuan of pure silver will be 6 mace 4 fen and 8 hao, plus a minting fee of 6 li, totaling 6 mace 4 fen 6 li and 8 hao in "ku ping." With the statutory price of silver dollars fixed and the silver tael abolished, there will be no more names of silver dollars in the future. People's hearts can be stabilized, and social finance can be greatly stabilized.</p>
<p>The only difficulty in implementing this strategy lies in the attitude of those with vested interests. The reasons held by the opponents are as follows: (1) They fear that the government will seek profit from it. The government has the power to mint silver dollars and stipulate the legal price of silver dollars. Therefore, when minting silver dollars, it deliberately reduces the purity, and the difference between it and the statutory color is the government's profit. (2) Society will suffer from the increase in paper money. Once the silver tael is abolished, the existing silver dollar chips on the market will be insufficient. Then, the opportunity can be taken to issue paper money indiscriminately, which is of great benefit to banks. Otherwise, the chips will feel scarce, and the social phenomenon will be obviously bad. (3) Silver taels can only be abolished after the unification of hard and soft currencies. Today,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>most banks issue paper money, resulting in a chaotic amount of paper money on the market. The quality of hard currency is already chaotic, and soft currency is like this. Therefore, abolishing taels and adopting the yuan is a major event, and it seems too early to do so. It seems that the above three points are true but not really true. If the government wants to make a profit, it does not have to wait until after the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan. It can also do so when manufacturing silver dollars in the Hangzhou factory. But the government has not done this at this time, so this point is self-defeating. Moreover, the silver dollars must be publicly verified before leaving the factory. Moreover, after the Shanghai factory is established in the future, there will be no problem in starting the furnace for manufacturing under the supervision of the business community and the industrial community, and the political forces will definitely not be affected. Therefore, it is better to take advantage of the decline in silver dollars and the decline in the price of silver dollars, and when many silver dollars are being melted, strive to abolish silver taels. Otherwise, there is no way to prevent the continued melting of silver dollars. If silver taels are abolished, then society will only use silver dollars and no longer use silver. The purpose of converting silver dollars into silver disappears, so there is no need to ban it, and it will stop naturally.</p>
<p>The opponents do not take into account the overall situation. They are afraid that future profit problems will gradually decrease. They see that the future of the bank is getting better and feel unwilling, and are motivated by private interests, so they express their opposition in order to turn the tide. When we observe from a third-party position, this move may be beneficial to banks, but we must know that the only purpose of abolishing taels and adopting the yuan is not for banks, but for the public. Therefore, the interests of the country should be taken as the premise, and it seems that opposition should not be added horizontally.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the money shops, the benefits will of course be lost. Because Shanghai money shops have current accounts, but no foreign accounts. For example, if a depositor deposits with silver dollars, they will convert it into silver taels according to the market price minus 1.25 (one hao and two hu and five) or 2.5, because silver dollars have no interest, so the depositor is also willing to convert it into silver taels, because silver taels have borrowing interest. When withdrawing, it is cost-effective to increase the market price, and profits can be obtained between the inflow and outflow. If the silver tael is abolished, then the money shop will no longer be able to obtain this benefit, and it is appropriate to oppose it. But this is not a big deal. Now there is something even worse than this, that is, the system of depositing and lending to the same industry will not work. Although there are many banks in Shanghai, and all of them have sufficient capital and good credit, their power is far less than that of money shops. That is, daily receipts and payments, such as those related to money shops, must be entrusted to money shops to act as agents. Because money shops have a clearing house for exchanging notes, banks cannot join. Therefore, the amount of money deposited in money shops by banks is as high as 10 million or as low as 5 or 6 million. Because if you want to entrust the money shop to act as an agent for collection and payment, you must first deposit it. This is called interbank deposit. Now, if we implement the reform of abolishing taels and adopting the yuan, then the only weapon of the money shop, the silver tael, will be defeated. The market will uniformly use money dollars and silver dollars, which are rich in banks. Then, all transactions can be done by banks alone, so there is no need to be controlled by the money shop. The money shop's acceptance of bank deposits will of course be cancelled, so interbank deposit will come to an end due to the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan. Once silver taels are abolished, the use of silver dollars will be greatly expanded. Then, banks will receive and pay more frequently, and it is not enough to set up a bank clearing house to settle everything. After the establishment of the clearing house, the debts between banks can be offset by the method of money shop debit notes, which reduces the use of cash and eliminates the trouble of transportation. It can save procedures and avoid risks. From now on, banks can devote all their efforts to business. Moreover, in times of market panic or financial emergency, the need for cash increases sharply, the borrowing interest rate soars, and borrowing is suspended. If there is a clearing house for adjustment, banks can change to using debit notes to clear their deposits and debts. Therefore, the power of the money shop is further reduced. Therefore, to sum up, the money shop will be affected in three ways after the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan: (1) The profit of one hao and two hu and five will be lost. (2) Interbank deposit is cancelled. (3) The bank clearing house is established. The bank joint reserve established by Shanghai banks this spring is the foundation for the future establishment of a clearing house. The debit notes and public treasury certificates issued are set up for the convenience of banks. Therefore, the prototype of the clearing house has been formed, and it is not impossible. However, the power of the money shop will not immediately disappear completely. The money shop's credit notes, which have a good reputation, can still be used in the market. Because the money shop's notes have a term of five days, seven days, and ten days, merchants naturally enjoy using them because of the interest for a few days. As for the odd numbers, banknotes can be used. However, the clearing silver and clearing head silver used by the money shop will inevitably be cancelled due to the implementation of the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan. Because the words "silver tael" are not established at all after the abolition of taels. It is of great benefit to clearing and money shops, because clearing silver must be paid in cash one day later, so the money shop can engage in obtaining one day's interest. If the number is large, calculated on the basis of 366 days a year, it is equal to one year's interest, which is a considerable profit. It is no wonder that the money shop is doing its best to argue for the existence of silver taels. As for the silver taels mentioned in the money shop's reasons for opposition, once abolished, the chips will feel scarce. If silver dollars and foreign dollars are used together, silver can be replaced by foreign dollars, and foreign dollars can be replaced by silver. It can be adjusted. It will not work after the silver tael is abolished. At first, this statement seems reasonable, but after careful examination, it is meaningless. If the power of the two is combined into one after the silver tael is abolished, isn't it one into two and two into one? Its efficiency is fixed, and it is still the same as before. If there are two small bowls of water, if there is less water in bowl A, the water in bowl B can be used to replenish it. Conversely, when there is less water in bowl B, the water in bowl A can be used to replenish it. This is of course a reasonable statement, but we can also combine the water in two small bowls into one large bowl. The amount of water is not reduced at all, and there is only convenience and no difficulty in application. As for banknotes, they will not be issued too much, because the current government strictly limits the issuance of banknotes. 70% of the cash and 30% of the guarantee reserve must be exchanged for 100% of the banknote issuance amount. Moreover, in Shanghai, there are more foreign dollars and less silver. There are 22 million silver dollars and 50 million taels of silver in Shanghai. Since there are already foreign dollars, there is no need to issue more banknotes. Therefore, the abolition of silver taels does not have much impact on the circulation of banknotes. The money shop also said that the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan must be done after the unification of soft currency. This statement is illogical. Who comes first and who comes later, who can make this judgment? The money shop said this, it seems too boring. The purpose of abolishing silver and using the yuan today is to unify hard currency. There is absolutely no reason why hard currency can be unified without abolishing silver taels.</p>
<p>Now, the advantages of abolishing taels and adopting the yuan are briefly described as follows: (1) Fiscal benefits. The various currency problems in the past in finance are mostly due to the conversion of silver taels into foreign dollars, or the conversion of foreign dollars into silver taels. The currency is formed between the inflow and outflow. (2) It will be easier to start reforming the monetary system in the future. Because the silver currency has been unified, it is easy to handle whether to change to the gold standard in the future or gradually adopt the gold standard, which is not as chaotic as in the past, and there is no way to start. (3) Time saving and cost reduction. If silver taels are abolished, the use of silver dollars will be unified, and the procedures will be simplified. There is no need to record both foreign currency accounts and silver tael accounts as in the past. The cost is large and the procedures are complicated. (4) The bank clearing house can be expected to be established. Due to the needs of the times, the clearing house can of course be expected to be established. It is a strange phenomenon in the international community that there is no clearing house in the banking community in the world today. (5) The silver taels in various places can be abolished one after another. Because the exchange rates in other ports in China are based on the Shanghai gui yuan, the Shanghai gui yuan has been defeated, and the silver taels in various places have no place to stand. (6) The Shanghai Mint will definitely start work. After the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan, the demand for silver dollars is urgent, so the Shanghai factory will start work to help the circulation of currency, and the market prices will not be affected.</p>

<p>The China New Agriculture Society has been established for three years. The purpose is to develop the rich resources in the Northwest and improve agriculture in the interior, with the goal of increasing the rate of birth and achieving national prosperity and people's affluence. During these three years, Mr. Ma Shaoji, the founder, has been preaching and contacting in many ways, and has achieved considerable results. In the past year, many well-known people have sponsored its progress, such as Zheng Hongnian, Wei Zizhong, Zhang Peinian, Cha Liangzhao, Tao Zhixing, Wang Zhengyi, Chuan Zuoyi, Gao Guizi, Chen Xihan, Ji Zhizhen, and dozens of others. After the Shanghai War, Mr. Ma believed that the work of fundamental national salvation was even more urgent and imminent. He came to Shanghai to set up an office to discuss everything with the sponsors nearby. He had agreed with Mr. Zheng Zhaojue, the president of National Jinan University, a month ago, to establish a reclamation and animal husbandry school centered on production in Suiyuan as a pioneer in the development of the Northwest, and to hand over 1,000 acres of good land donated by overseas Chinese to Jinan University (in Jurong) to the society for operation as a new agricultural experimental zone for improving agriculture. Mr. Zheng returned to Shanghai a few days ago, and Mr. Ma asked Mr. Zheng to review the planned reclamation and animal husbandry school and discuss the steps to be taken. Yesterday, it was decided to first hold the Jurong experimental zone, which will be funded and carried out by Jinan University and President Zheng. As for the reclamation and animal husbandry school, it will also be started after investigating a suitable location. It is reported that Mr. Ma will take President Zheng's letter to Nanjing to contact him in the next few days, and will also accompany Mr. Zhang Zibin, a member of the Agricultural Art Design Committee of the society, to Jurong to conduct a detailed survey in order to draft a plan and start it as soon as possible. It is said that after Mr. Ma's next agricultural plan is realized, the precarious agricultural future of China will be brightened.</p>

<p>Mr. Ye Huijun, a Shanghai gentry, suddenly contracted an abdominal tumor on March 9 this year. He was treated for a long time, but it was ineffective. He died suddenly at 1:30 pm yesterday. Mr. Ye lived to be 70 years old and had two sons, seven grandsons and granddaughters. All sectors of society were deeply saddened by the news.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Portrait of Mr. Ye Huijun <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ye had revolutionary ideas. During the Jiawu and Gengzi Wars, the court was corrupt. He organized a gymnastics association and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to gather comrades and seek self-improvement. In the third year of Xuantong, he officially joined the Tongmenghui and secretly planned the revolution with Shen Manyun, Zhu Shaoqi, Chen Yingshi, Li Pingshu, etc., and organized the Patriotic Association and the National Chamber of Commerce Federation. During the battle on September 13 of that year, he personally supervised the members of the regiment and attacked the Gaochangmiao Manufacturing Bureau. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the sea was recovered. Later, the Shanghai Military Governor's Office was established, and Mr. Ye served as the temporary military and political commander. In the first year of the Republic of China, he followed the Premier to the capital and served as the police chief of the Presidential Palace. When Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, he once bought Mr. Ye for 5,000 gold. He fled to Fusang in the east and took the opportunity to investigate the industry and commerce of that country. After Yuan's defeat, he returned to Shanghai and engaged in local undertakings. He successively served as the director of the Commodity Exhibition Hall, the director of the County Chamber of Commerce, the president of the Miscellaneous Grain Association, the director of the Soybean and Rice Industry, the councilor of the Shanghai Special City Council, the member of the City Government Construction Discussion Committee, and the executive member of the General Chamber of Commerce. In short, throughout his life, he devoted himself to the country and the local area. His death is also a misfortune for the people of Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e133">The County Security Corps Special Training Class Started Yesterday <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Security Corps planned to set up a special training class. After the active preparation of Xu Yi, the teacher of the class, the opening ceremony was held in the auditorium of the county government yesterday. More than 100 people attended the meeting, including representatives of the county party department, directors of various bureaus in the county, directors and heads of districts, chiefs of various public security bureaus, representatives of various agencies, and all the students. The chairman, Yan, who is also the general head, reported on the preparation process and delivered a speech (recorded later). Then, Peng Liren, the representative of the county party department, Shi She, the director of the education bureau, and Wu Shifang, the director of the first district, successively gave speeches and took photos. Then, the representatives visited the classrooms and dormitories. The internal layout was clean and tidy, and they were praised. It is heard that the students admitted to the class were selected by the district regiments from the outstanding members of the current Jia Pai (甲牌) leader and deputy captain, so they were full of energy and the level was neat. The instructors, Lu Zhongyu, Fu Dianying, Ge Xiusheng, and Yan Jingtang, all have considerable experience in academic subjects. The training speech of Yan, the general head, is recorded as follows: Most of the security groups in various places adopt the employment system, which is inconsistent with the current security group law. The intention of the security group law is to have the people defend themselves, that is, the people defend themselves, not to have others defend us by employing mercenaries. It is still "defending others" rather than "self-defense." However, if the people are to defend themselves, they must have self-defense, organization and self-defense capabilities. To have an organization, it is necessary to focus on investigating the population and organizing the strong men. However, after the organization, if they are not given skill and knowledge training, they will still not be capable. This county followed the provincial order and completed the organization work in a practical manner before the deadline. The continued work is to start training. However, the number of members is large, and it is impossible to concentrate the training. There are not so many people in the government to teach them individually. Therefore, the Provincial Security Committee has stipulated the method of special training classes, drawing out a few outstanding members from each district and coming to the county for centralized training. You must exercise your responsibility, which is very important. You will not only be excellent and dedicated members in the future, but also go back to each district to train other members. In other words, you are the cadres of the security groups in each district. Whether the purpose of the people's self-defense can be achieved and whether there is real self-defense power depends on whether you can work hard during your studies and after you go out. Although the training and internship period is only six months, I have clearly instructed all the instructors to do it in a down-to-earth and serious manner. Since you are here to receive military training, you should strictly obey discipline and not relax at all. The weather is very hot now. You have to go to the drill field and to the lecture hall. There is almost no time to rest. Some people must think it is very hard, but we cannot make progress without hard work and patience. You all have jobs, and you have to take the time to receive a few months of training, and you must cherish these few months, so that you can live up to yourselves.</p>

<p>The China National Road Construction Association received a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, with an enclosed official letter from the German official, asking to send representatives to participate in the 7th International Road Conference held in Germany in April 1924, to report on the actual situation of Chinese roads, and to study important proposals such as traffic innovation. The association is a member of the International Road Conference, and after receiving the letter, it has decided to send personnel to participate according to the precedents of previous sessions to increase international glory.

<h3 id="e137">The Public Works Department Plans to Build a Prison in the Chinese Territory <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>A Request to the Consular Body to Handle</p>
<p>The Public Works Department Information Office announced yesterday that at a meeting of the Police Committee a few days ago, the Chief Patrol Officer submitted a report stating that the number of prisoners in the Western Prison on Huade Road has reached 7,046, and it is estimated that it will reach 7,500 by the end of the year. Not only is it crowded and worrying, but it is also feared that first-time offenders and minor offenders will be detained with serious criminals, which may lead to the contamination of bad habits. According to the current situation, if you want to detain prisoners according to the type of crime, it is impossible due to the situation. The only way to remedy the situation seems to be to designate the Western Prison on Huade Road to exclusively detain serious criminals with a sentence of more than two years, and build a new prison to detain minor criminals with a sentence of less than three years. It would be better if an agreement can be reached with the Chinese authorities to build a prison in the Chinese territory to detain minor criminals. In addition, the patrol room also manages prison administration, and the duties are too cumbersome. The Chief Patrol Officer is unable to take care of it. Whether it should be divided and a special office should be set up to be directly responsible to the Public Works Department should also be considered. After discussion by the members, the Public Works Department should be asked to consider it urgently. If it is difficult to add a new prison financially, the Consular Body should be asked to contact the Chinese authorities for the purpose of relief, and it is believed that if a new prison is built, it should be outside the concession. The Public Works Department should, in principle, agree that the number of prisoners detained in the Western Prison on Huade Road should not exceed 4,000. As for prison administration, it is agreed that the proposal of the Chief Patrol Officer will be followed. After Martin is back in Shanghai from his leave, he will be filled with the position of Extra Chief Patrol Officer, and Shanghai will be used as the warden of the prison. This case was submitted to the board's regular meeting on Wednesday for discussion. Because adding a new prison requires a lot of money, it was unanimously decided to ask the Consular Body to handle it as soon as possible according to the committee's recommendations.</p>

<p>The Pudong District Rent Reduction Movement Committee believes that the municipal government's promulgation of rent reduction measures has not been announced in Pudong District, which is unfair.

In addition, various labor unions in Pudong District held a joint meeting at the Fifth District Labor Union yesterday at 6 pm, resolving (1) that the rent reduction measures of the municipal government are unfair and requesting that the order be withdrawn, (2) requesting the Municipal Party Department to argue reasonably, (3) sending a letter to the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association to uphold justice and negotiate with landlords to voluntarily reduce rent, (4) issuing a declaration to Pudong tenants, and (5) providing financial assistance from various labor unions in Pudong.</p>

<p>A Reuters dispatch from Hong Kong on the 15th reported that Jardine Matheson's Jilong (transliteration) ship suddenly exploded in its second cabin this morning while loading several barrels of cars next to the Mobil Oil Company's oil pool. The company's fire brigade and two fire boats from the Hong Kong government used water and chemicals to extinguish the fire in the cabin for two hours before the fire was put out, but the hull had already tilted 25 degrees to the left. Four workers are missing, and three others were seriously injured. Many workers were in the second cabin at the time, but they managed to escape, which was considered a miracle by everyone. One of them had a leg broken. The cause of the explosion has not yet been determined. The ship weighs 1,984 tons.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Ministry of Communications Investigates the Shanghai-Shashi Shipping Scramble <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Dropping Prices to Compete is No Different From Suicide</p>
<p>Holding on to Monopoly Merchants Oppose</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Ping An, Yu He, Daxing, and other companies mutually opened Shanghai-Shashi regular ships, and the two sides brewed a big trend of shipping competition. Now, the Joint Shipping Bureau of the six companies has sent Bao Feng and Xin Renhe two ships to compete, and the fares have been greatly reduced, preparing to drop to free and then add gifts. Recently, the Bureau accused China Merchants of disrupting the situation to the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry ordered the Shanghai Maritime Administration to investigate. Today, China Merchants submitted the details of the matter to the Maritime Administration, stating briefly that the company is a part of the China Merchants Bureau, and the profit and loss of its leased ships are related to the state-owned shipping industry. Moreover, with the smooth flow of highways, business is sluggish and it is difficult to maintain. Most routes have suspended classes. In order to adjust shipping, the Shanghai-Chongming and Shanghai-Shashi classes were added to make up for it. However, Zhang Housheng, the person in charge of the line, was not good at management, so the company took it back to operate on its own. Now it is greatly reorganized and strives to innovate, which is deeply welcomed by the people of Shanghai and Shashi. It is investigated that Shanghai-Shashi business is a legal business. How can there be speculation and intrusion to disrupt the situation? I don't know what the Bureau is based on. It is said that the Shanghai-Shashi Joint Shipping Bureau raised fares and monopolized profits. In June of this year, the gentry and merchants of Haimen were angry that they raised ship prices and held the shipping routes. They raised funds to create new wheels to maintain transportation. The Bureau's only plan is to hold on to the patent, which is a loss of the duty to serve the society. Moreover, the shipping routes are open, and each operates its business and is at peace. The Bureau is jealous of the same industry and must beat Jingde to the end. This case has been submitted to the Ministry to thoroughly investigate and stop it. Now the company preemptively accuses it of speculating and disrupting the situation. I don't know that Jingde wheel started sailing in April, and the Bureau was established in June. It was Jingde that started sailing first, and the Bureau was established later. Moreover, the Jingde fare is the same as the Bureau, but because there is no wharf, it is more than a dozen copper coins less to subsidize passengers' fares. On July 1, the Bureau made a big advertisement and arbitrarily reduced the fare, charging only 50%. The company was forced to do so and had to reduce the price according to the passengers' request. I think that dropping prices to compete is close to suicide. It is a pity to waste useful money on meaningless land. However, the dispute was opened by them, and the company could not reduce the price even if it did not want to. The Bureau only reduced the fare arbitrarily on the day Jingde opened (every other day), and raised the ship price again on the day Jingde did not sail, using the name of dropping the price to beat down Jingde on the one hand and deceiving passengers on the other hand. It used false economic power to overwhelm China Merchants and used sensational words to report to the Ministry to disrupt the situation as a word of resistance. If only the Bureau is allowed to sail on the Shanghai-Shashi line, then any shipping route can be arbitrarily held in the future. Moreover, Jingde applied to the competent authorities for approval at that time, which is also equivalent to a virtual setting. If it hinders the Bureau's shipping industry, it will lose the heart of the world for the public. The Bureau has been planning to trap Jingde in desperation, then Jingde can transfer to other lines, and other shipping bureaus can also use this to block shipping. I think that the disaster of competition is originally suspended as a severe prohibition. In case a tragedy is caused by the Bureau's price competition, the responsibility will be borne by the Bureau. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e144">Russian Beggar's Nasal Bone Examined <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Three Doctors' Examination Procedures Not Completed</p>
<p>Trial Date Not Yet Determined</p>
<p>The suspicious death case of Russian beggar George Ladikiev in the Second Special District Court detention center has been prosecuted by the police department against the detention center director, medical officer, and guard. Two court hearings have been held, and the famous British and French doctors Smith and Virillo have been extended to join Dr. Wei Ligong, a forensic doctor of the court, and Sanderly, a forensic doctor extended by the police department, to dissect the body at the Tarasto Road Public Works Bureau Hospital autopsy room on the morning of the 13th. The results of the autopsy showed that there were no wounds on the body, and it was indeed a death from illness. However, due to the suspicion that the nasal cartilage had fallen off, the detached nasal bone was taken for expert research and examination to determine whether it was a new or old wound. It was originally scheduled that the three forensic doctors who came to the scene to examine the case that afternoon or the next day would issue an autopsy report and submit it to the court for approval. It has been repeatedly reported in the news. It is now learned that the forensic doctors have not completed the nasal bone examination procedures, so they have not discussed and decided, and the autopsy report has not been submitted to the court until yesterday morning. However, for the sake of caution, the court must wait for the autopsy report before it can set a trial date. It is heard that the brother of the deceased, Simon Wright, is still placing the coffin in the cold storage room of the autopsy room without burial.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Husband and Wife Accuse Each Other of an Embarrassing Photo <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Wife Accuses the Husband of Abandonment and Forcing to Sign a Note</p>
<p>The Husband Claims to Confirm the Divorce Contract</p>
<p>Gu Yuequan, a local who runs a furniture store at No. 38, Miaolong, English Concession, is 46 years old. In March of the 15th year of the Republic of China (lunar calendar), he married Zhou Huizhen (28 years old), a woman from this county, through a matchmaker. Since their marriage, the couple's feelings have been very strong for six years, and they have had three sons. Unexpectedly, they suddenly turned against each other. The husband accused his wife of adultery and had a divorce note. The wife accused her husband of doting on his concubine and bullying his wife, committing abuse, injuring her body, intending to abandon her, and forcing her to sign a note. They went to court and went to extremes. Gu hired lawyer Zhu Xiyi to sue his wife Zhou Huizhen in the civil court of the First Special District Court, requesting mediation to confirm the validity of the contract. The court hearing was held, but the mediation failed, so he officially filed a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The husband sues the wife. The plaintiff's wife, Zhou Huizhen, committed adultery with Shan Yonglin. On June 9, the plaintiff arrested them both in room 6 of the Datong Hotel on Six Ma Road. At that time, they were handed over to the patrol room and sent to the court for investigation. Later, the defendant asked Dong Xinhai to come to persuade them, saying that the defendant was aware of committing adultery and violating the morals of women, and was now willing to sign a divorce note for each party to use as evidence. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff recently entrusted lawyer Cai Xiaobai to publish a notice denying the divorce and falsely accusing the plaintiff of forcing the note. It is found that Shan and the defendant committed adultery, and there is full evidence. The publication of the denial is obviously intended to renege, so he specially filed a lawsuit, requesting that the divorce contract signed by the plaintiff and defendant on June 9 be confirmed as valid. The court president Zhou Han came to the seventh court to hear the case on the morning of the day before yesterday. The defendant Zhou Huizhen was not present. According to the plaintiff Gu Yuequan's confession, he ran into his wife and Shan walking together in the French Concession on June 9, so he followed them and witnessed them entering room 6 of the Datong Hotel and saw Zhou and Shan together in bed through the window outside the room. So he waited until the next morning before he went to arrest the adultery, and there was a photo taken at the time as evidence, so he submitted the case. The photo showed a man and a woman sitting on the bed. The man was only wearing a small shirt, and the woman was barefoot and only wearing a shirt and pants. The situation was very embarrassing. Later, court president Zhou said that the defendant could not be found, so he ordered the notice to be served and then verified. This is the situation of the husband suing the wife.</p>
<p>The wife sues the husband. However, Zhou Huizhen also hired lawyer Tao Wuzhi to file a lawsuit, accusing her husband Gu Yuequan, Shan Yonglin, Dong Xinhai, etc. of abuse, injury, and forced signing of a note in the criminal court of the Special Court. Yesterday morning, judge Ge Shixun came to the criminal court to gather information. Only the defendant Gu Yuequan and his lawyer were present. Shan and Dong were not present. Zhou Huizhen, the self-accuser, confessed that after marrying the defendant, she had three sons and the relationship was harmonious. Three years later, Gu gradually developed the idea of abandoning the old and liking the new, and took Zhang Lanbao as his concubine. At about 9 pm on April 16 this year, due to a trivial matter, the defendant immediately stabbed my left hand with a knife, causing serious injuries and bleeding profusely. Fortunately, she met a Chinese patrol on the way and sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment, and reported to the General Patrol Room. The patrol officer said that since it was a husband and wife relationship, it was inconvenient to interfere and told her to file a lawsuit in court. The defendant Gu Yuequan was deeply afraid that I would formally file a lawsuit, so he changed his methods to deal with me, pretending to reconcile with me, and secretly designing to frame me. On the evening of June 9 this year, he said that the weather was stuffy and borrowed a hotel to stay in for comfort. I believed it to be true and went to live in the Datong Hotel on Six Ma Road. The next morning at 9 o'clock, Gu made an excuse to go out to collect debts. At 11 o'clock, the bastard Shan Yonglin broke into the room. When I asked about his intentions, before I could finish a word, more than a dozen hooligans followed in, holding pistols, with a fierce momentum, claiming to arrest adultery as a reason, forcing me and Shan to be adulterers and adulteresses, and Shan did not argue about this point, and remained silent. At this time, even if I had a hundred mouths, it would be difficult to explain. While arguing, Gu Yuequan, a photographer, and a lawyer entered the room together, forced me to take a photo with Shan, and ordered Shan to take off his clothes. If there was any resistance, they would use fists and feet and aim the pistol to shoot. Under this circumstance, I completely lost my freedom. A man named Dong Xinhai, who claimed to be Lu Zhongda, acted as a mediator and pretended to persuade me. Then the lawyer drafted a single contract to break away from the husband and wife relationship and forced me to sign the contract. Shan and Dong actually acted as witnesses. I was unwilling to sign, and the hooligans pointed at me with pistols, saying that if I did not sign, I would be executed immediately. After signing, they took me to the pre-hired car to Lawyer Wu's office and copied several copies of the single contract, and then forced me to sign it before I could escape from the tiger's den. I now live in my mother's home in Longji Lane, North Zhejiang Road, so I specially came to file a lawsuit. Judge Ge verified the confession and learned that the plaintiff Zhou Huizhen and the defendant Gu Yuequan were formally married. According to Article 339 of the Criminal Procedure Law, formal spouses may not self-accuse and must be filed by the patrol room. He then explained this to the plaintiff's lawyer Tao Wuzhi and instructed him to convey it to the plaintiff. After the instructions were completed, he wrote on the case dismissal form that this case would not be accepted.</p>

<p>Throat Pierced with a Small Knife</p>
<p>A Tragedy of Life</p>
<p>Gu Zhou, a local woman who lived in a flat at No. 14, Fudeli, next to Zhilanli, Kaizi Er Road, French Concession, was 37 years old and earned a living by washing clothes. Her husband, Gu, was addicted to opium. Some days ago, he went out and bought two yuan of opium and brought it back. He was found by the investigator on the way and detained in the Second Special District Court for questioning. He was to be fined 30 yuan for possessing opium. He was unable to pay the fine and exchanged it for one day of imprisonment with two yuan. He is still in custody. Ms. Gu was ill. After learning that her husband had been detained, she was worried and anxious, and her illness worsened. Because she had no money for treatment, she suddenly had a short-sighted idea. At 5:30 pm on the 15th, she held a small foreign knife at home and stabbed her throat to commit suicide, falling to the ground in a pool of blood. When a cohabitant, Mr. Jia, returned home and saw her dying, he immediately reported it to the patrol room. The car sent her to Renji Hospital. Because of her serious injuries, she died at 10 pm that night after ineffective treatment. The hospital notified the patrol room and sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall autopsy room. Because no family members were present, the case was reported to Prosecutor Wu of the Second Special Court yesterday, who came to the hall to verify that the deceased had died from a knife wound. The body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for photographing and collection. The small knife was kept on file.</p>

<p>This newspaper Shanghai Daily reported that Mrs. Smith Maya, a Western woman, was walking past the front of No. 50 Minhang Road, Japanese merchant Kuwano Yoko's store, in December of last year when she was suddenly bitten by a dog kept by the store. Later, after mediation by the Public Works Bureau, Kuwano Yoko bore the medical expenses. Unexpectedly, after Mrs. Maya was examined at the Gongji Hospital, her hand bone was broken and required three months of treatment. Kuwano Yoko ignored it, saying that the matter was not intentional and there was no agreement to bear the medical expenses. Therefore, Mrs. Maya filed a civil lawsuit for damages with the Japanese Consulate General the day before yesterday because of Kuwano's rude attitude.</p>

<p>Winning Good Criticism from Chinese and Foreigners</p>
<p>Chen Shuren's solo painting exhibition opened yesterday at the World Society World Academy at No. 393 Foch Road. The venue is a purely modern building, magnificent and splendid, with ample light and meticulous layout. For a time, Shanghai's literati and artists gathered to appreciate it. It is estimated that those who attended the meeting that day included Mr. and Mrs. Li Shizeng, Mr. and Mrs. Liu Yazi, Zhang Jingjiang, Lin Fengmian, Chen Mengshi, Ye Gongchuo, Mrs. Gan Naiguang, Jiang Xiaojian, Liu Haisu, Wang Jiyuan, Chen Zhifo, Shao Xunmei, Hua Lin, Sun Fuxi, Ni Yide, Zhu Shaoping, Xie Gongzhan, etc. They were all amazed at the great success of Chen's art, but especially admired Chen's advocacy of art and his enthusiasm for the cause of art and culture. Because Chen, while working in politics and revolution, still strongly promoted art, such as the recent China-Germany Art Exhibition and the plan for the Second National Art Exhibition, Chen is one of the most diligent people. That is, this Chen Shuren solo painting exhibition was also held in the midst of great busyness. His concern for the cause of culture and his pursuit of permanent happiness for the people can be seen. It is also heard that the dynamic education expert Dr. Wei Zhong has written a long article commenting that it is the best work since China exhausted. Other Chinese and English newspapers have come to the meeting to photograph Chen's recent works and small images, which will be published in special editions every day, which is an unprecedented grand occasion in past solo exhibitions.</p>

<p>Liu Tongsheng, a buyer in the Western Medicine Department of Tianna Yoko and a native of Jiujiang, was kidnapped by bandits at the entrance of Yi's house at No. 218 Yuezhou Road at about 10 am on the 6th of this month. After being rescued, Huishan Patrol Room's Chinese detectives Lu Gengsheng and Jin Chenruhai successively arrested five bandits in the case: Qian Xuen, Ji Muhua, Jiang Jingui, Wang Alin (also known as Tang Hongfu and Tang Liancheng), and his mistress Lu Huang. They were escorted to the First Special District Court for questioning and details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin came to Criminal Court 4 to continue the hearing. The Patrol Room lawyer Zhang Tianyin said that during the rescheduling, it was detected that the leader of the case, Zhang Changgen, was hiding at No. 40 Huade Road. Chinese and Western detectives went to arrest him without success. The house had an iron box, containing clothes, two iron beds, a brown mat, a quilt, a sheet, a camp bed, a gasoline stove, and wooden long oranges. The Patrol Room brought everything to the case and asked for a ruling. The hostage Liu Tongsheng is being treated at the Bone Hospital in the French Concession. According to the doctor, it will take three months to fully recover. The facts of the case are very clear. Except for Lu Huang, all the defendants admitted to the charges without hesitation. He asked the court to end the case as soon as possible. The Patrol Room investigated and found that Lu Huang had no real relationship and asked for her release first. After questioning the four defendants Qian Xuen and others, their confessions were the same as before. Judge Fu asked Lu Huang briefly, and after the lawyer provided free defense to the defendants, he ordered them to be returned to custody to await sentencing on a scheduled date. Lu Huang was released first, and the seized items were stored in the warehouse to be claimed.</p>

<p>Zhang Wenming, the owner of Songmaoyuan Paper Store at Nos. 53-54 Shandong Road and a native of Wuxi, 45 years old, returned with his wife from a relative's house at 3 am yesterday morning. When they were walking in the Mantingfang Lane on Wuma Road, they suddenly encountered two thugs. Seeing that his wife was wearing a diamond ring and a gold ring each, and a gold cigarette holder, and carrying a white towel bag containing chestnuts, one of the thugs flew forward and pressed his bag to try to rob it. Zhang saw the situation and knew that they were not good people, so he told his wife to give him the cigarette holder and shouted "Robber" wildly. The robbers were afraid that the patrolmen would come, so they hurriedly pulled out a gun and fired a shot, hitting his left heel. Blood was pouring out. The robbers fled into the horizontal lane. After the patrolmen heard the police and rushed to the scene, the robbers had disappeared. They had to send the injured person to Renji Hospital for treatment.

<h3 id="e156">Verification of the Death of Two People Run Over by an American Military Vehicle <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, around 3 PM, Zhou Zhengfu (age 28) and Tian Laihai (age 36), two rickshaw pullers from Jiangbei, were resting by the roadside at the intersection of South Suzhou Road and Yuanmingyuan Road due to the hot weather. Unexpectedly, a military truck with license plate number 9814, carrying more than 20 Navy personnel from the American military camp at 50 Haifang Road, was speeding eastward from the park's shooting range towards the Moore Road barracks. The driver, an American soldier named Ker-Ai-Er Chi-Si (transliteration), struck Zhou and Tian, causing severe injuries. A Chinese patrolman from post number 39 witnessed the incident, immediately recorded the truck's license plate number, and transported the two injured men by car to Renji Hospital. They succumbed to their injuries and died shortly after. The incident was reported to the General Inspectorate, which ordered detectives to investigate. The bodies were then transported to the autopsy station on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Zhang Yaoguang, along with medical examiner Zhang Junrun, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, to the station to examine the bodies. Driver Ker-Ai-Er Chi-Si, age 26, American, stated that while driving through the intersection of South Suzhou Road and Yuanmingyuan Road, he saw a car of unknown license plate stopped in the middle of the road. He attempted to steer slightly south to avoid the car, but it suddenly moved. At that moment, there was a damaged vehicle and two rickshaws parked on the south side of the road. The two deceased were standing next to the rickshaws, causing his vehicle to collide with the damaged vehicle. The damaged vehicle was pushed by his car and then collided with the rickshaws, resulting in the injuries of the two men. He stated that his car did not directly hit them. Pan A'san and Shen Jiufu testified that they were pulling rickshaws with Zhou and Tian. At the time, they stopped to rest by the roadside because of the long distance and hot weather. There was a damaged vehicle parked in front of their two rickshaws. Zhou and Tian were securing the goods on their rickshaws when the military truck sped from the west, first colliding with the damaged vehicle, then violently colliding with their two rickshaws, causing them to overturn and injuring Zhou and Tian. Zhang Jun obtained the statements and ruled that the deceased, Zhou Zhengfu and Tian Laihai, died as a result of being run over by vehicle number 9814. The bodies were handed over to Pushan Villa for funeral arrangements.</p>

<p>Many Severely Injured</p>
<p>Huang Yaxiang, Cai Ruihua, Cai Guochu, and others, residents of Guohuo Road in the South City, are known to be troublemakers. A dispute arose between women over two roots of vegetables. They attempted to resolve the matter at a small teahouse at the entrance of Nandeshengli, but to no avail. Immediately, they engaged in a major armed fight on the street with iron rods, axes, single-edged swords, and handguns. As a result, Huang Yaxiang, Huang Hu, Li Donggui, Xiao Meichu, Chen Ziyun, Li Zhenyuan, Li Zhenfu, and others were severely injured. Some had head wounds with blood and brain matter flowing out, others had ruptured abdomens with intestines spilling out. All were in life-threatening condition. The police from the Chezhan Road Police Station arrived and took the injured to the Second District. They were immediately presented to the District Court, where the prosecutor examined them and sent them to Xin Puyu Hall for treatment. After the bloody battle concluded, three cars arrived at Guohuo Road at 6 PM, and over thirty people wearing white shirts and black pants jumped out. Each was armed with a handgun and searched Guohuo Road for the residents who had fought that morning. However, all of them had fled and hidden, so a major disaster was narrowly avoided. Residents of Guohuo Road, who were outside enjoying the evening breeze, saw the situation and rushed indoors, closing their doors to avoid trouble, suffering a scare.</p>

<p>Fearing the Concubine Would Report to Her Husband</p>
<p>They Defiled Her As Well</p>
<p>The Affair Was Exposed, and They Fled Together</p>
<p>Lu Yunsheng, a 37-year-old platoon leader in the Shanghai City Defense Corps from Zhenjiang, resided at 83 Jiaxing Road, Hongkou. The upstairs was his home, and the downstairs was Lu Yun Ji Paint Shop, which Lu owned. Lu had a wife and a concubine. The wife, Tang Zhenzhu, was 29 years old and had been married for 12 years. The concubine, Zhang Dongqin, was only 18 and had been married for just six months. They all lived together. Tang, while not beautiful, was extremely promiscuous and had an ongoing affair with Li Zhifa (age 23) from Pudong, who worked at the shop. They had been secretly meeting for some time. However, they were constrained by Lu's presence and could not fully indulge. Recently, Lu fell ill and resided alone in the attic, leaving his wife and concubine in the front building. On the night of the 9th of this month, Tang saw that Zhang was sound asleep and invited Li upstairs to meet again. As they were finishing, Zhang suddenly woke up. Tang and Li, realizing their affair was exposed and fearing that Zhang would report to Lu Yunsheng, decided to silence her. Tang covered Zhang's mouth, while Li straddled her and forcibly raped her. Their intention was to prevent Zhang from speaking out, believing that if she was defiled, she would be too ashamed to reveal the truth. However, after being defiled, Zhang immediately told her husband. Tang and Li, realizing their plan had failed and they could no longer stay at Lu's house, packed up over a thousand yuan worth of clothing and ornaments and fled together. Lu reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched detectives Bao Shuji, Bao Liu Decheng, and Mu Chunrong to investigate Lu's home. They found Li Zhifa's cigarette case under Tang's pillow and a bundle of soiled cloth and Li's clothing under the bed, which they took back to the police station. The evening before last, around 12 AM, Detective Bao and others learned that Tang and Li were hiding in room 45 of the Si Ming Xie Ji Hotel at 96 West Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession, using the names Wang Kechang and Wang Lushi. They coordinated with detectives from the French Police to raid the room, arresting the adulterers. They also recovered a suitcase containing the items Tang had taken. They were taken back to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Criminal Court of the First Special District, where Judge Huang Weihua opened the court for questioning. The police station's lawyer, Hu Jiabao, stated that due to the urgency of the case, the police station had not yet formally filed charges and requested permission for temporary detention. Detective Bao then gave a report on the circumstances of the case. Tang Zhenzhu denied the affair with Li, claiming that Zhang Dongqin had falsely accused her. Li Zhifa did not deny the affair with Tang. Judge Huang ordered the two defendants to be detained and adjourned the case for further investigation before submitting it for trial.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods has repeatedly received letters from domestic goods factories in this city and other cities producing silk, satin, cloth, and various cotton textiles, stating that they all use enemy goods from the small character brand for their required steel reeds. Since the September 18th Incident and the invasion of Northeast China, the people of the whole country have been angered and are enthusiastically boycotting enemy goods. Those with substitutes have stopped using them and are actively manufacturing domestic goods, striving to save the situation. However, the steel reed is an essential item for this industry. Shanghai is a concentrated area for the production of domestic goods. They are requesting the association to investigate whether domestic products are available for purchase, or to encourage their creation, in order to facilitate boycotts. The association believes that the demand for steel reeds is extremely high, with each industry losing over洋2 million. Promoting domestic goods and increasing production is a bulwark against enemy goods and a long-term tool for resistance. The association has a responsibility to investigate and cannot decline. The association assigned the investigation to the investigation section. It is now known that investigation section members Chen Binghui and Yang Yucheng have been working hard in the summer heat and have found the following four factories in Shanghai that manufacture and supply steel reeds: (1) China Steel Reed Factory, Gong character trademark, factory located at the Tianhou Palace Bridge approach; (2) Shanghai Steel Reed Factory, Xiang character trademark, factory located in Heng'an Lane, Nanyang Bridge; (3) Wulin Steel Reed Factory, Double Ten trademark, factory located in Huaxing Lane, Tangshan Road; (4) Qinyi Steel Reed Factory, Yi character trademark, factory located in Sanxing Lane, Baoding Road. The products are of good quality and are no less than enemy goods, and the prices are also lower. Moreover, the production volume is extremely high and sufficient for the application of domestic goods factories, making them a vital force in the production of domestic goods. The association has already sent letters and steel reed samples from each factory to those who requested it for trial use, and has also notified factories in various industries that require this product to promote cooperation.</p>

<p>During the recent Songhu Anti-Japanese War, the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association spared no effort in comforting soldiers and relieving refugees. They took great care in managing the treatment of wounded soldiers, running their own hospitals or partnering with other organizations to subsidize medical expenses, which was widely praised by all parties. A few days ago, Military Commander Cai specially donated a plaque, inscribed with "Friend of Our Army," with a postscript at the end stating, "During the January 28th Anti-Japanese War, wounded officers and soldiers were deeply indebted to Shanghai hospitals for their accommodation and treatment, achieving excellent results. I hereby record these words to commemorate this event." The Maintenance Association has long been disbanded. It is now reported that the Shanghai Municipal Local Association, initiated by members of the association, will receive and hang the plaque (1138 Jing'an Temple Road). The close relationship between the 19th Route Army and the citizens of Shanghai is evident from this.</p>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam, This is to inform you that we have received a letter from the Board of Directors of the Shanghai City Dongting Xishan Jinting Guild Hall stating that they were "astonished" to read the report "Reactions to the Jinting Guild Hall Forcibly Collecting Tips," which is inconsistent with the facts. The Board states that it was ordered to renovate the city rooms of the guild hall and did not sign contracts with the tenants. Therefore, it is not subject to any restrictions. It is now unreasonably accused of forcibly collecting tips and should bear the burden of proof. If the tenants cannot produce the receipt issued by the guild hall to Shan Yunsheng, causing the guild hall to suffer any direct or indirect losses, the tenants should bear the responsibility. We request that your lawyer represent us and request that Shen Bao promptly correct the information in the Letter to the Editor section of your newspaper. We would be very grateful for your help. Sincerely, Lawyer Ye Foukang, July 15th,</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Chief Editor of Shen Bao, Greetings, I am writing to you regarding the news article "Dispute over the Jie Fa Steamer Incident" in the June 25th issue of your newspaper. After reading it, I was greatly surprised. The details of the Jie Fa steamer incident differ from what was reported in your newspaper. The report is completely based on rumors and is inaccurate. It is clear that outsiders are unaware of the truth, leading to misinformation. The Jie Fa steamer ran aground near Sang Island in the Bohai Bay on the afternoon of April 13th. The chart indicated a submerged reef. The next day, the shipowner and an employee of the ship hull insurance company (i.e., the Shanghai Lianbao Company), Mr. Jiang Junzhe, hired the　島丸 from the Manchuria Railway Company to provide assistance. Due to the severe damage to the ship's hull, it was already in a semi-sunken state and in extreme danger. As a result, rescue efforts were abandoned, and only the lives of the 58 crew members were saved and returned to Dalian. At the request of the shipowner, the Datong Branch of the Longkou Agency sent personnel to Sang Island to cooperate with the island's security force in guarding the ship on land. On April 20th, the Lianbao Company again attempted rescue, requesting the shipowner's representative, Cai Lu, to provide assistance. On the same day, they hired the Song丸 from the Songpu Steamship Company together with Jiang Junzhe, and it was agreed to set sail from Dalian on the 22nd. For the sake of time and economy, the shipowner's representative, Cai Lu, was instructed to first take the Song丸 to the Datong Branch of the Longkou Agency to arrange for the necessary tugboats, sampans, and coolie tools for the rescue, so that the Song丸 could immediately take the tugboats and coolies to the rescue upon arrival in Longkou. On April 20th, Jiang Junzhe of the Lianbao Company, along with several others, sailed from Dalian on the Song丸. On the morning of the 23rd, they arrived at the site of the Jie Fa incident. Jiang Junzhe and others personally boarded the Jie Fa to inspect it. In the afternoon of the same day, they left the Jie Fa at Sang Island and arrived in Longkou around 4 PM. They had a cordial conversation with the shipowner's representative and the manager of the Datong Branch, stating that the hull and remaining cargo of the Jie Fa were in the same condition as when it ran aground, without any movement. They also praised the guards for their diligent watch. On the same day, due to the late hour, only the hired coolies and tools were sent to the Song丸, preparing to go to the rescue the next morning. Unexpectedly, on the 24th, a strong wind and rough waves prevented the tugboats from working and the Song丸 from proceeding. It was reluctantly postponed until 6:30 AM on the 25th, when Jiang Junzhe, along with several others, as well as Cai Lutong, the manager of the Datong Company, boarded the Song丸 for the rescue. On the way, they discovered the Jie Fa was on fire. By the time they arrived at the scene, the fire was too intense to approach. The Sang Island security force sent personnel to report to the Song丸. They said that the fire in the stern of the Jie Fa was discovered around midnight on the 24th. Although the cause of the fire was unknown, the land and sea of Sang Island were exceptionally peaceful, and there had never been any incidents of robbers or pirates. Furthermore, there were no ships approaching the Jie Fa before or after the fire. These are the facts of the incident. As the ship had been destroyed, there was no need for the guards to continue watching. They were all withdrawn to Longkou on the same day. The report in your newspaper that the shipowner sent six tugboats from Longkou and guards to the wrecked ship to salvage cargo, resulting in the death of Feng Lianrong and the payment of condolences, is completely false. As for the alleged control of the Lee Township head of San Island in Huang County, it is a riot due to infighting on the island, and is unrelated to the Jie Fa incident. I have provided a detailed account of the facts in order to clarify the truth and avoid misunderstandings. Shipowner Representative Cai Lu Proxy Longkou Datong Branch</p>

<h3 id="e181">Principles and Standards for Abolishing the Tael and Adopting the Yuan (Continued) by Xu Peikun <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>(C) The Origin of Monetary Disputes. The disputes arising from the coexistence of taels and yuans, as explained previously, are not as serious as commonly perceived. Therefore, using this point as the rationale for currency reform is inadequate. However, whether China's monetary disputes are limited to the relationship between taels and yuans or if other monetary disputes exist should be noted and analyzed by us. In my observation, the disputes between taels and yuans are relatively minor. The significant monetary disputes in China lie in the differences in silver scales across regions, the variations in various silver dollars, the inconsistencies in various small silver coins, and other subsidiary currencies, as well as the differences in various paper currencies across regions. These numerous disputes concerning hard and light currencies are well understood by both the silver and money circles. If they are not resolved and only the conversion from taels to yuans is addressed, today's plan to abolish the tael and adopt the yuan will be nothing more than a pipe dream. Lastly, international settlement involves many disputes in gold and silver conversions. The procedures for converting various silver dollars into various silver taels and then into various gold dollars are numerous, and the discrepancies are significant. The rise and fall of foreign exchange rates, even by a fraction of a cent, can result in substantial gains or losses beyond description. If the foreign exchange rate is fixed at 7.2 mace, the conversion calculation will be much more convenient, and extraneous gains or losses can be avoided. It is hoped that after the foreign exchange rate is fixed, a portion of the conversion disputes in gold and silver settlements can be resolved. However, many disputes still arise from the fluctuation of silver prices and the changing ratios between gold and silver. Today, we are vociferously advocating for the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan, but whether this dispute can be resolved and whether it will be practically beneficial are preliminary issues. As things stand, the gold-silver ratio may not be a problem, and abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan is indeed a good remedy for the problem. Previous advocates for a gold standard mostly based their arguments on the changing gold-silver ratio. However, the unsuitability of the gold standard for our national conditions has been conclusively proven by the facts of the past year and cannot be denied. Moreover, most countries have abandoned the gold standard, with only one or two countries struggling to maintain it, only to fail in the end. In the future, various countries may adopt a bimetallic standard or a special standard, which is currently being brewing. However, in any case, various countries will certainly add silver coins and carefully plan ways to stabilize the gold-silver ratio. Therefore, after China abolishes the tael and adopts the yuan, disputes in gold and silver settlements are expected to gradually decrease, and I firmly believe that China will be a beneficiary.</p>
<p>(D) Principles for Abolishing the Tael and Adopting the Yuan. Having understood the above points, we can begin to discuss the principles for abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan. If we want to abolish the tael and adopt the yuan, in addition to resolving the disputes between taels and yuans, we must also resolve the various monetary disputes mentioned above. This is part of the principle. However, the more profound meaning of currency reform lies in seeking to establish a stable and unified national currency system, so that national currency and prices do not fluctuate drastically. It is necessary to ensure that China's currency is indeed a perfect standard for measuring prices, and further, that China's currency can accurately represent the purchasing power of each individual. Furthermore, it should ensure that China's currency is a standard for both material and labor value, and that it can reliably represent the permanent wealth of groups or individuals. It should also ensure that China's currency is a standard that is easy to exchange and suitable for the standard of living. As mentioned above, only the silver yuan unit and a perfect subsidiary currency system can competently fulfill these requirements. Due to space limitations, this article cannot analyze each point in detail. However, generally speaking, the monetary units of various countries in the world are only gold, silver, and paper. The inapplicability of the gold standard to various countries in the world, and even more so to our country, has been discussed in detail over the past year. As for paper currency, it can only be hoped to circulate when the credit system is developed to the extreme. There is no possibility of adopting a paper standard within the next fifty or sixty years. Therefore, China only has the option of adopting the silver yuan unit system. Furthermore, by considering the situation, studying the reasons, and taking both into account, China's decisive adoption of the silver yuan unit system at this time is indeed an excellent opportunity to obtain a perfect monetary system. It is not clear whether those who currently advocate for the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan are advocating for the adoption of a silver standard or are merely using it to resolve local disputes between business taels and yuans. If the latter is the sole intention, it will not only fail to resolve monetary disputes but will also increase them. Treating the headache when the head aches and the foot when the foot aches is the usual trick of incompetent doctors to kill people. This is such a major issue, and it is hoped that the ruling officials will take it seriously and not imitate the actions of incompetent doctors and apply them to the people whose livelihoods are full of wounds. Having decided on the overall principles for abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan as before, implementing reform policies based on these principles will achieve the practical effects of abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan. Otherwise, it will only cause disputes and be of no benefit. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e182">Textual Research on the Soft Language of Wu: Dou, Qie, Zhou <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The soft language of Wu has never had a specialized book, and there are many well-known sayings that everyone is said to be able to speak. What is written is that everyone cannot write. Why can't they write? It's just because of the changes in sounds. Errors are passed on, resulting in the loss of the true meaning.</p>
<p>I really want to organize the Wu dialect a bit. Although there is a partial rudimentary framework, it is still far from success. I'll first bring up three words that are often said in the mouths of Wu people: (1) The first word cannot be written, so I have to write a fanqie, which is the word "De Ai." In the mouths of Suzhou people, to describe someone as very flattering, they call him "De Ai."</p>
<p>(2) The second word is written incorrectly. Ordinary Suzhou vernacular letters often write the word "Qiu." If the body is not well, it is called "body Qiu." If the goods are not good, it is called "goods Qiu." A person with a bad temper is called "Qiu person."</p>
<p>(3) The third word is also written casually, often written as the word "Zhou." The word "Zhou" and the word "Qiu" have similar meanings, but there is also a distinction: the word "Qiu" represents not strong, and the word "Zhou" represents not straight.</p>
<p>According to my humble opinion, the above three words are not difficult to write. Tracing back to the source, they are probably these three words:</p>
<p>(1) The word "De Ai" was originally the word "Dou." Whenever saying a few flattering words, the more the voice trembles, the more it pleases people; to please people, the Wu dialect calls it the word "Dou." Upon hearing a trembling, intimate voice, they say: Dou de lai—Dou de lai! This word "Dou" was originally a direct cut, but later, through errors, it was read as "Ai Qie," and then as "De Ai Qie"; the words "De" and "Ai" are alliterative; therefore, this word "Dou" is called the combined sound of the two words "De Ai."</p>
<p>(2) The word "Qiu" should be written as the word "Qie"; if the physique is not strong, it is called "body Qie"; if the will is not strong, it is called "temper Qie." Qie is "Qu Jie Qie," Qiu is "Qu Jiu Qie," Qie and Qiu are alliterative. The vulgar errors are all due to the alliteration relationship; therefore, this word "Qie" is also called the word "Qiu."</p>
<p>(3) The word "Zhou" should be written as the word "Zou"; Zou means uneven. Uneven skin is called "Zou skin"; an uneven temper is called "Zou temper." Zou is definitely an oblique tone, and the word "Zhou" is a level tone; the four tones in the mouths of Suzhou people are originally casual; it is no wonder that the oblique tone word "Zou" is read as the level tone word "Zhou."</p>
<h3 id="e183">Preface to Chen Shuren's Collection of Paintings <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>Mr. Shuren asked me to write a preface to his collection of paintings. I have worked with Mr. Shuren for a long time. During breaks from official duties, we would sometimes discuss poetry, and I often had the opportunity to view Mr. Shuren's paintings. I do not understand painting, and my understanding of poetry is also very shallow. I once wrote in the preface to my own collection of poems:</p>
<p>The Book of Poetry says, "The people are weary, let them have a little rest." How apt are these words. People cannot but labor, and labor cannot be without rest. To labor long and rest briefly is what people should do and also the greatest joy in life. My poems are thus composed at such times. Therefore, my poems cannot be like the images on the cauldrons of Yu, which expose evil, or the warm rhinoceros horn, which illuminates monsters, exhaustively capturing the essence of all things and leaving nothing hidden. They are merely like woodcutters and peddlers, walking a long road under the scorching sun, occasionally laying down their burdens and resting under a tree, sitting together in a circle, singing and laughing, to forget their suffering for a moment. Therefore, I named my collection "A Little Rest."</p>
<p>My understanding of poetry, after more than twenty years of study, is still so shallow. How much more so when it comes to painting, which I have never understood. How can I write a preface for Mr. Shuren? However, Mr. Shuren and I are both committed to the revolution, taking labor and hardship as our lives and sacrifice as our ultimate goal. We do not do it for any pleasure, but because our conscience dictates that we must. The comfort we receive also comes from the joy of a clear conscience. To take too much pleasure in worldly enjoyment is not only damaging to our integrity but will also lead us into sin. Not to mention material desires, even the so-called natural beauty seems impartial to people. However, under dilapidated huts and inside coal mine tunnels, the notion of impartial sunshine and wind naturally has its limitations. Since we cannot be without labor and labor cannot be without rest, then what we take for comfort during these brief rests is that natural beauty is relatively guilt-free. The phenomena of heaven, earth, and all things are noble yet accessible, profound yet candid, pure yet full of change, and they are in seamless harmony with our innocent conscience. Fan Zhongyan said, "Not to be pleased by external gains." At such moments, we no longer know whether we are things or things are us. Between heaven, earth, and all things, there is compassion and no resentment, there is goodness and no evil. We frolic freely, and deceit does not arise. This moment of comfort is more than enough to forget a hundred years of labor and hardship. When emotions stir within us, they are expressed in songs and manifested in paintings. This happens naturally because we do not want this fleeting moment to pass away but seek to prolong and yearn for it endlessly. I ask Mr. Shuren, what do you think?</p>

<h3 id="e185">Northeast Education <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>Mr. Ge Gongzhen recently returned from the Southeast and spoke about the education in the Northeast with extreme pain. The following is a summary. Mr. Ge said that Buddhism considers knowledge as a demon. That is true. The intellectual class in the Northeast, especially in the education sector, is the most miserable. It is impossible to express the pain. If there is indeed a hell in the world, then the Northeast is the hell on earth. And those in the education sector are in the lowest level of hell. They live in a state of not being able to die and not being able to live. There is no way up to heaven and no door down to earth. The mental stimuli they receive often drive people to madness. College students either join the volunteer army or flee for their lives. The innocent are slaughtered one after another. It is confirmed that Fengyong University has been changed to Manchuria University. It will be implemented soon. Secondary schools are currently closed, as they fear that students gathering together will easily incite unrest. A vocational high school outside Shenyang City once prepared to reopen. However, the day before the reopening, each room in the school was plastered with slogans such as "Down with Japan" and "Rather be a Chinese ghost than a puppet slave of a foreign country." When the teachers saw this situation, they gently advised the students to be patient and not to ruin the big plan with small impatience. The reopening and resumption of classes were thus interrupted. Due to the limited time, the textbooks for secondary schools could not be rewritten, so the old textbooks were revised. Whenever the words "Republic of China" appeared, they were all changed to Manchuria. Naturally, any text unfavorable to Japan was deleted. Most of the primary schools have reopened. Primary school students are young and have limited knowledge, so they have no ability to resist Japan. Therefore, Japan takes advantage of their malleability and carefully molds them. The curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education have been completely overturned. Of all the subjects, only five remain: Chinese, Ethics, History, Geography, and Mathematics. All textbooks have been rewritten, focusing on building Manchuria and resisting China. Although the teachers are Chinese, Japanese people often come to the school to supervise and interfere. The teachers, with various grievances, teach with tears in their eyes. Recently, there has been a "Manchuria Founding Movement," forcing primary school students to participate, singing the Manchuria national anthem, and saluting the crossed Manchuria and Japanese flags. The families of primary school students who disobey are often ravaged. Today, education in the Northeast is managed by the Ministry of Education, headed by Zheng Xiaoxu, who follows Japanese instructions. Currently, the Japanese are hiring Japanese education officials who have experience in running schools in Korea to go to the Northeast to take charge of education and culture. They plan to apply the methods of Korea to the Northeast. Alas, who is doing this? Who caused this? How did it come to this?</p>

<p>— Zhen Yue</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, two guests came from Jinshan. One was surnamed Xu, from Fengxian, and the other was surnamed Pan, from Zhujing. They came specifically to visit the Hefeng Agricultural and Forestry Farm. Mr. Xu carried a birdcage with a myna bird inside. As soon as they entered the gate, they hung the cage on the grape trellis. After a while, the myna bird suddenly made sounds like a magpie and a chicken. Then, it spoke in human language, saying, "Myna, myna, myna eats meat." The voice was like that of a child, clear and pleasing to the ear. Mr. Xu said that the bird had been raised for three years and could say many things. It could even shout anti-Japanese slogans. After a moment, the myna bird indeed wagged its small tongue and spoke clearly in human language, saying, "Down with Japan! Down with Japan!" It shouted and jumped as if in great pain and also with a brave posture. It was truly commendable. It is not strange that a myna bird can speak, but it is rare to hear it shout anti-Japanese slogans.</p>

<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>The new national hero General Ma Zhanshan raised the banner of righteousness in the Battle of Nenjiang. Recently, he launched a major offensive against the puppet state outside the passes, causing countless brave men of iron and blood to rise up. However, the people inside the passes are no longer as enthusiastically supporting the war as before. This is something that makes people feel deeply saddened.</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army and the Volunteer Army fought bravely. The blood of the nation earned international sympathy. The suffering endured by the people in the war zone gave foreigners an even greater stimulus. At that time, whatever the army needed, it was almost granted with a thousand promises. The provinces in the interior reported through radio, rushing to transport day and night. The spirit of cooperation between the army and the people was fully demonstrated in this regard.</p>
<p>We also remember the spirit of joy and excitement of the people when the revolutionary army first arrived in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the 16th year of the Republic of China. The expression of cooperation between the army and the people was definitely not worse than it is now. For example, in the Yanzhou Zhuji area, farmers in the mountains helped the revolutionary army attack Meng Zhaoyue's troops with earthen cannons, reminding people of the people's ardent hopes for the revolutionary army at that time.</p>
<p>This kind of earthen cannon is called a sandalwood cannon. It is made of a kind of hard sandalwood from the mountains. The heart of the tree is carved out, leaving a shell. The outside is wrapped in iron. The cannonballs are also made by local methods, using gunpowder and the hobnails of the villagers' shoes. They can be fired for about three miles with each shot. However, they cannot be used after firing ten shots.</p>
<p>At that time, Meng Zhaoyue's troops said that the revolutionary army's cannonballs had tails. It was truly unimaginable that they were actually the hobnails of the villagers' shoes.</p>

<p>— Shou Heng</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jiading, the commander of the Central Army Cavalry Training Corps and the 1st Cavalry Brigade, recently launched a military officer equestrian competition to arouse the interest of learners and promote the attention of the Chinese people. In advance, invitations were sent to various sectors at home and abroad to visit and observe. The following is a review of the grand occasion.</p>
<p>The competition venue was the brigade headquarters' horse field in Xiaoying. Nine types of obstacles were set up, including high bars, double bamboo bars, three-wood bars, wooden walls, and trenches. Everything was available. The highest was about one meter and the widest was about one meter and thirty centimeters. Each obstacle was marked with red, yellow, blue, and white flags. Judges were stationed in various locations. The layout was extremely intricate. Mr. Li reported that due to the limited ability of the horses, there could be no deep equestrian performance. However, what was arranged today was a small angle change of direction and various paces to overcome obstacles. Therefore, it is necessary to have a firm riding position and consistent support between man and horse in order to turn freely and fly over them. On this day, the weather was extremely hot, but the guests were still very enthusiastic. For a time, there was a constant flow of vehicles. Zhu Weizhen of the Military Affairs Commission, Yao Jiecheng, Chen Yi of the Ministry of Military Administration, Zhang Zhizhong, commander of the 5th Army, Foreign Advisor Fo Cai'er, Cavalry Supervisor Wang Haoji, and hundreds of principals, officers, and students of various military specialized schools were present. There were more than 2,000 guests. At about 4 o'clock, the sound of trumpets moved. All the more than 50 participants, led by the brigade chief of staff, arrived in formation. First, a military parade was held, with the brigade commander leading more than 20 representatives of various senior military organs to inspect the horse field. Then, a parade was held before the competition began. In general, the participants were all in high spirits. They soared up and leaped over obstacles, accompanied by melodious and exciting military music, making them even more brave. Applause thundered. The audience cheered wildly. It was truly a sight to behold.</p>

<p>— Huang Ren</p>
<p>The false eyelashes used by fashionable women in Europe and America are glued to the eyelids with a kind of harmless glue. Black and long ones are considered beautiful. These false eyelashes cost seven shillings and six pence to fifteen shillings per pair and can only be used for two weeks before they need to be replaced with a new pair.</p>
<p>In Victoria, Australia, rats are rampant. They run around day and night and are not afraid of cats. They often attack in groups. At night, people sleep in bed and rats often walk across their bodies.</p>
<p>It is said that playing cards originated in India. Seven hundred years ago, nomadic gypsies went to Europe and brought playing cards with them. From then on, they became popular all over the world and became a common gambling game.</p>
<p>Londoners love flowers. Almost every family uses flowers as decorations. Taking bottled flowers alone, more than 1,200 tons are transported every year. During the flowering season in spring, there are always twenty-five special trains transporting flowers into the city every day.</p>
<p>India has many long forests and abundant grass. Therefore, there are also many snakes. Although doctors have methods to treat snake venom, saving thousands of lives every year, in the past twelve months, more than 25,000 people have died from poisonous snake bites.</p>
<p>American rayon is made entirely from sugarcane residue. Each sugarcane factory must produce 500,000 tons of sugar residue every year for the manufacture of rayon.</p>
<p>There are several specialized doctors in western England. In order to maintain the secrecy of their medicines, they often do not write the names of the drugs on the prescriptions but use numbers instead, ordering patients to go to a designated pharmacy to fill the prescriptions. Only one pharmacist knows what the numbers represent. They have agreed in advance.</p>
<p>The popularity of precious jewelry in England often changes. Last year, rubies, which were ranked fifth, have suddenly become very popular this year. Fashionable women often wear scarlet ornaments, so they have risen from fifth place to first place. Next are beryl, diamonds, pearls, and sapphires.</p>

<p>— Xu Muxi</p>
<p>In such hot weather, being able to hide in the countryside and read a little book is considered a blessing by everyone. Therefore, I can get my wish, and I feel that I can force a smile, although since I recognized the human world, the distress of the environment has weighed heavily on me.</p>
<p>This is my hometown. Not long ago, it was forcibly occupied by the enemy, making the virgin who had just come of age even more haggard. Ah! This cold village, this cold village like a deflowered virgin! Secluded dense forests cover the traces of bombing, and the croaking of frogs and the chirping of cicadas interweave to create the symphony of nature; this pain, this annoyance, can never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Although rural life is calm and leisurely, in the madness of the times, the simplicity that shrouded it has also undergone significant changes due to the advancement of the storm. The most sacred and tranquil countryside will henceforth be transformed inland.</p>
<p>The afterglow of the setting sun is a flowing, graceful, gentle sight. Standing by the pond under the willows, chatting with the old farmers in the fields, pursuing life from the pure and honest conversations, in such a clean environment, there is no longer a trace of the atmosphere of urban vices.</p>
<p>The collapse of the rural economy is not a symbol of today. It has long indicated that this is inevitable. However, the farmers are still working hard to remedy the situation, wearing bamboo hats, plowing hard in the fields. The scorching sun has turned their shoulders and backs bronze. This spirit of great fearlessness is the characteristic of the greatest warriors in life, and they have the same value as worship as the soldiers who advance with the sound of drums and horns to eliminate the common enemies of mankind. Warriors, fearless warriors, they are the most worthy of this world, but this world has let them down.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Merchant Association's market trading still showed signs of sluggishness, with few transactions. However, the collective sale of No. 24 Dutch raw white sugar by an industry association is gradually taking shape. Market sentiment has slightly improved from stagnation, with transaction prices at 14 taels and 5 cents. The supply is scarce, and the trend remains firm. No. 84 Dutch red sugar is at 10 taels and 7 mace, and raw red sugar is at 12 taels. The market also appears stable. The trading of Taikoo sugar is very sluggish: B mark at 16 taels and 3 mace, CW mark at 15 taels and 8 mace, DY mark at 15 taels and 5.5 mace, and H mark at 12 taels and 5 mace. Although demand is quiet, inventory is low. The company's large volume remains quite firm, so the market situation is relatively stable.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Silk, Tea, Factory Silk Warp Sales Still Not Quiet <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm silk market, European and American firms remained inactive. However, silk merchants showed considerable interest in white factory silk warp. Unfortunately, prices tended to be weak. It is estimated that Meiya and other silk factories purchased ten packages of 20-22 thread white factory silk warp for 495 taels. Jinma brand also purchased ten packages of 20-22 thread white factory silk warp for 470 taels. Huangpodun brand purchased ten packages of 13-22 thread white factory silk warp for 490 taels.</p>

<p>Native silk factory sales are stagnant... Dry cocoons cannot be mortgaged</p>
<p>Chang'an in Zhejiang has now become the central area of silk production. In recent years, silk fabric sales have plummeted, and both the silk and weaving industries are on the verge of bankruptcy. After the spring cocoons were launched this year, few cocoon businesses opened their scales, and cocoon prices were surprisingly low. Farmers are heavily indebted and generally dry the cocoons themselves. However, the market has become increasingly sluggish, and no one inquires about silk or cocoons. Villagers who still have native silk are affected by the encroachment of artificial silk and Japanese silk. Silk factory sales are stagnant. Those who have dry cocoons and want to mortgage them for cash cannot find anyone to accept them. Farmers' economies are becoming increasingly panicked.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Low-Grade Zhenmei Tea Sells Well, Prices Rise <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British firms like Yingzhuang Xiehe Yihuo Yulong and others showed strong interest in low-grade Zhenmei green tea from Wenzhou Yushan native estates and other regions. The entire market was very active, and selling prices were 4 or 5 taels higher than before. High-grade Zhenmei teas from Wuyuan Tunxi and other regions had brisk sales of selected teas, while ordinary teas were slightly sluggish. However, inventories of Tunxi, Suian, and Xiuning teas are not abundant, so Chinese tea merchants remain firm in their attitude, and the market is expected to rise without falling.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Coal: Mark and Henan White Coal Market Uniquely Firm and Sought After <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the trading of various grades of white coal screenings has been quiet, and selling prices have frequently fallen. However, Mark white coal and Henan white coal are uniquely firm and sought after, refusing to decline easily. Their selling prices exceed those of Hongqi coal. Currently, Mark screenings sell for 19 taels and 5 mace per ton, and Henan screenings sell for 20 taels per ton. The reason is that the available goods are not abundant, and costs are high.</p>

<p>The sales of British tinplate in Shanghai are almost surpassing American goods. However, this year's goods are ten times more than in the past, which has caused the market to become weak. It is said that the main reason for this price decline is the impact of the Boxer Indemnity Committee ordering a large quantity of goods (estimated at over 50,000 boxes) from England for shipment to China. Recently, according to reliable sources, the British Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Boxer Indemnity Committee to maintain market stability, suggesting that the 28,000+ boxes of goods that have already arrived but not been sold be returned to England. If this happens, the Shanghai market may have hope for recovery.</p>

<p>— Fo</p>
<p>A few days ago, I wrote two articles on "The Truth About Suicide." I still have more to say. I traveled to Suzhou because of some business. Today, I'm changing the topic, but I'll still thoroughly explain the unfinished meaning of the previous articles.</p>
<p>Gentlemen (this "gentlemen" refers to those who pursue love, not ordinary gentlemen), after reading my previous discussions advocating late marriage and discouraging romance, you may be somewhat unhappy and find it unpalatable. It is truly "advising with words that do not please the ear." Today, I will teach you a method for picking up girls. Are you willing to welcome my words?</p>
<p>Do you want to pick up girls? The only condition is to focus on studying. Concentrating on studying and picking up girls are unrelated, so why do I say that it's the only condition? Let me explain. Modern women (this is a common characteristic, not just for women) have a very strong sense of vanity. If you have special talents or excellent knowledge in school, the opposite sex will naturally admire, approach, and look up to you, turning around to "kneel at your feet in your Western suit." Otherwise, no matter how crisp your suit is, how shiny your shoes are, or how much "Stancombe" hair oil you pour on your hair, the opposite sex will absolutely not welcome you. Even if they do, it's "low-class." What do I mean by low-class? Low-level actions that have no meaning. You are probably doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Don't you believe me? In your school, there must be two types of students: those who study hard and have abilities, and those who only like to dress up and act foolish. Ask the "Misses," what is your attitude towards these two types of students? Which type of student do you treat more kindly? You can test it out with this. Look at the important figures with knowledge in the government. Even at an advanced age, there are still several young and beautiful modern "Misses" willing to accommodate them and invite them to fulfill their obligations (this word "obligation" is Chiang Kai-shek's ingenious term). This is very strange.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the concept of marriage will soon be completely eradicated. The Communist Party of Russia has completely abolished the marriage system, transforming it into a "friend-like" spousal system. Even in Eastern and Western countries where the marriage system has not been abolished, many people choose to be free and not marry, waiting until their lives are stable before getting married. So, when you hear that they are getting married, it is very late. As for our country's important figures, they divorce one and marry another, treating married couples as less than friends. Isn't this fundamentally destroying the spousal system? Especially in China, where production is backward, the average commoner finds it difficult to maintain their own livelihood. If they form a family, the burden is even heavier. How can they bear it? The number of suicides is particularly high, perhaps for this reason.</p>
<p>If you completely see through this truth, observe the concept of life with a different perspective, and thoroughly consider the advantages and disadvantages of any undertaking before starting, then it will be appropriate. Otherwise, "blessings can be doors to misfortune." You may be excited now, but you will regret it later!</p>

<h3 id="e217">Silver Engraving Method <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Yinglou</p>
<p>Not long ago, I introduced the etching method of copper and iron in this column. This small craft with artistic interest is indeed very valuable. Here, I would like to introduce the silver engraving method. Silver seems to be a softer material compared to other metals. Therefore, sometimes carving with a knife can also be effective. However, the manual method is not as convenient and agile as the chemical method, and it is also more interesting.</p>
<p>The anti-etching agent for silver is generally the same as that for copper and iron. A more convenient method is to mix four parts of beeswax, one part of tallow, five parts of rosin, and ten parts of pine root oil to form a liquid for use.</p>
<p>There are several ways to prepare the etching agent for silver.</p>
<p>(1) Dissolve ten parts of strong nitric acid in twenty parts of water. (If the object to be engraved is larger, add more strong nitric acid and twice the amount of water.) This is a very simple method, and its etching effect is also very strong.</p>
<p>(2) Dissolve thirty grams of potassium chloride in three hundred parts of boiling water. Then dissolve thirty grams of pure hydrochloric acid in three hundred parts of water. Mix the above two solutions together for use. The etching power of this agent is stronger than the first method.</p>
<p>(3) Mix 250 parts of pure nitric acid, 60 parts of ether, 4 parts of acetic acid in 250 parts of water. This agent has a slower chemical reaction and is suitable for fine engraving.</p>
<p>Regarding silver etching engraving, there is a drawback, which is that silver is more expensive. After silver utensils are etched, the scrap silver from the etched parts is completely discarded, which is a pity. However, if you use the first type of etching agent mentioned above, there is a remedy. After strong nitric acid and water etch the silver utensils, there is a kind of silver nitrate left in the liquid. We can add table salt to the liquid. Silver nitrate is combined with the sodium salt of sodium chloride by the缘化反应, precipitating the silver quality and forming white silver chloride. Then filter and dry it. Add the same amount of potassium sodium carbonate as silver chloride, put it in a lead pot, heat it with coal fire, and the original silver quality will be restored, sinking to the bottom of the pot and solidifying into a block. In this way, there is no loss. However, this method is suitable for silver utensils that consume too much silver. If not much is etched away, it is not a pity to discard it, and there is no need to bother.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Teasing the Teacher <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>Mr. X, the English teacher at XX School, is good at</p>
<p>dressing up and likes to wear Western suits. Unfortunately, his face is pockmarked, which is his shortcoming. One day, when he was teaching, he had just finished taking attendance, picked up a piece of chalk, and was about to raise his hand to write when he saw a few lines of writing left on the blackboard. He inadvertently read it aloud and was furious: "Nonsense!" "Bullshit!" poured out like a string of beads. Why? Because what was written was:</p>
<p>"Flipped pomegranate skin, mud-printed sole, two kinds of concave-convex shapes, that is the teacher's face."</p>
<p>This five-character poem clearly portrayed him and was making fun of him, so no wonder he was filled with anger and burst into cursing. After cursing a few times, he immediately turned his face to pay attention to everyone's attitude, wanting to find out who was playing tricks. Little Li, who was known throughout the school for causing trouble, was laughing so hard that he bent over backwards and couldn't be happier. Mr. X believed that it must be his mischief again and reprimanded him sternly. But this trouble was not caused by him, so of course he was unwilling to endure it and stood up to resist, saying</p>
<p>"Mr. X, don't scold people indiscriminately. There is another note posted over there. Please check whether the handwriting is the same and whether it is my handwriting." As he spoke, he pointed to the wall with his hand. Mr. X looked in the direction he pointed and saw a piece of paper posted there. He tore it off and looked at it, knowing that it was another playful poem mocking himself, saying: "The teacher after all loves to be modern, the Western suit on his body is brand new, the most pleasing to the eye is the sculpture of hundreds of flowers on his face."</p>
<p>At this time, he was really so angry that he lost his mind, forgetting to investigate the matter. He didn't even have the mood to teach and picked up his book and ran out of the classroom before the bell rang. From tomorrow onwards, he will sever ties with the school.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Teaching Him a Lesson <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Yongnian</p>
<p>That's right, this incident really taught him a lesson, making him understand the dark side of society and making him realize that everything in the past was wrong.</p>
<p>Originally, he was a modern young man, dressed in a Western suit, handsome, and good at social conversation. Therefore, he was very attractive to the opposite sex.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was Sunday. The X Theater was performing the sensational X Drama. As usual, he dressed up beautifully and went to the X Theater. After entering, his first goal was naturally to find the opposite sex. His sharp rat eyes darted around restlessly, searching for the opposite sex that he wanted in his mind. Upstairs, he suddenly found a member of the opposite sex that he wanted. The clothes of this member of the opposite sex were exceptionally beautiful, and her face and figure were also very modern. Coincidentally, there was an empty seat next to her. He was overjoyed upon seeing this and unceremoniously sat down next to her.</p>
<p>The play was performed, and he watched the stage very calmly. However, his mind was busy figuring out how to start a conversation with her.</p>
<p>After about half an hour, he mustered his courage and said, "Miss... are you... here... alone..." After he said this, his heart was beating very fast.</p>
<p>"..." She didn't say anything, but her body moved slightly and she smiled slightly at him.</p>
<p>He was extremely happy. He knew that she was also interested in him, so he boldly bumped her left arm with his right arm and said again, "Miss... how beautiful."</p>
<p>After repeated temptations, she had been seduced by him. The two of them were slowly getting into a conversation. No one sitting next to them could guess what they were like.</p>
<p>He casually inquired about her background. She told him everything. He then realized that she was the daughter of a wealthy gentleman. He secretly praised his good fortune.</p>
<p>After a while, an usher led a person to them. They were both startled. She took a look and saw that it was her family's maid. She couldn't help asking, "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"Miss, I've been looking for you so hard. The master has something urgent to ask you to come back immediately," the maid said breathlessly.</p>
<p>"Ugh... how annoying," she said unhappily. "Let's meet tomorrow, goodbye," she said to him again, "Don't forget, I'll still be waiting for you here tomorrow." She nodded, led the maid, and left gracefully.</p>
<p>After she left, he felt bored, so he also left. When he returned home, he sat down and thought about what had happened. He couldn't help regretting not asking her where she lived, so he could write to her if she didn't come! Suddenly, when he reached into his pocket, his face immediately turned pale. At the same time, he was anxious and flustered. It turned out that his wallet, which contained three hundred yuan in banknotes, was missing. He didn't know when he had lost it. He tried hard to think, but he couldn't remember. In an instant, he suddenly thought of her. It seemed like when he was talking to her, her hand had bumped his pocket. Perhaps she had stolen the wallet. The more he thought about it, the more it seemed likely, and he couldn't help hating her. From then on, when he saw women, he was always hateful and dared not look at them.</p>
<p>Problem</p>
<h3 id="e220">Ah San <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 𢛓</p>
<p>The train from N Station had just arrived at S Station, and passengers were scrambling to get off. At that time, people outside the station were soliciting for hotel business, shouting, "Huizhong, Shenzhou, Dongya." Rickshaw drivers were shouting, "Yellow car, Feilong." There were also rickshaw pullers, carriage drivers, and small cart drivers shouting, "Rickshaw, carriage, small cart." The situation at that time was truly chaotic. Rickshaw puller Ah San had not found any business for a day. He waited at the entrance of S Station, hoping to find a customer with good luck.</p>
<p>"Hey, sir, do you need a rickshaw?" Ah San saw a young man in a Western suit standing still, so he hurried to pull his rickshaw next to the young man and asked.</p>
<p>"How much to Lihua Company?" the young man in the Western suit asked.</p>
<p>"Three jiao yuan, is that okay, sir?" Ah San opened his eyes wide and waited for the young man's reply. "Three hundred qian, not a single qian more," the young man in the Western suit replied firmly.</p>
<p>At that time, more and more passengers were gathering, and the noise of cars, carriages, and rickshaw pullers made it difficult for passengers to walk. The police managing security at the station hurriedly hit Ah San with the whip in his hand, driving him away. Ah San was afraid that his license would be torn up by the police, so he hurriedly pulled the rickshaw away as if flying. In an instant, the young man in the Western suit was also gone. Ah San had no choice but to stand there in disappointment, staring blankly at the cars and carriages.</p>
<p>Family Problems</p>
<h3 id="e221">Fuse <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Shiben</p>
<p>Master He is truly blessed. He is not yet fifty years old, but he already has two sons, two grandsons, and more than fifty thousand yuan of inherited family property. In our village, he is the most prosperous and fortunate person.</p>
<p>He spends his days smoking opium and playing mahjong, entrusting all family affairs to his eldest son. He does not care about anything himself, which is so leisurely and happy. Moreover, the old couple's love is still very strong, even though they are not young. In addition, his sons and daughters-in-law are very filial to him. Therefore, the entire He family is filled with an atmosphere of harmony and happiness every day. There has never been a disagreement or quarrel. People see his family getting along so well and envy them, saying that the He family is just beginning to prosper.</p>
<p>Stillness leads to restlessness, and satiety leads to lust. These two sentences were unfortunately born in Master He's heart. This spring, Master He was bored at home and went to Shanghai to play. In a hotel, he met a modern woman and was completely charmed by her. Master He regretted not meeting her sooner and spent thousands of yuan to bring her back.</p>
<p>Since this concubine entered the He family's door, the harmonious atmosphere was suddenly broken. Because she is a modern woman, accustomed to a luxurious life in Shanghai, she eats and wears expensive things. How can frugal people like Mrs. He tolerate this extravagant behavior? Therefore, less than a month after she came in, Mrs. He had already started quarreling with her. Originally, Mrs. He was not only stingy with her spending, but the jealousy of vinegar also occupied an important component. But she is not easy to deal with, used to being reckless and domineering, so she would not show weakness. Therefore, when Mrs. He quarreled with her later, she would definitely put on an all-out performance. As a result, Mrs. He was old and had bound feet, how could she be a match for that thick-footed modern madam? She lost and ran to tell her son with a crying face. Originally, Master He's son had long disapproved of bringing this flamboyant young concubine in. He secretly complained that his father should not have brought this troublemaker to squander the family property when he was already old and had children and grandchildren. He thought to himself that this would definitely lead to an uncontrollable situation. Although he complained in his heart, he always remained silent. Now seeing his mother being beaten and insulted by her, he could no longer remain silent. He hurried to reason with her, but in the end, he only had a verbal battle. From then on, Mrs. He resented her husband for doing such an ungrateful act, and she put her former feelings behind her. Every day, she either fought with her or quarreled with her husband. The two sons also disliked the old man for being indecent, bringing this spendthrift to squander the family property, and they became estranged from their father. They were careful in everything and sometimes helped their mother, also arguing with their father and her. All the actions in the family were divided and ruled, each occupying one side and not being subordinate to each other.</p>
<p>Alas! A harmonious family, once a fuse comes, it shatters the entire beautiful state. Husband and wife are not in harmony, father and son are not in harmony. Master He's family, from then on, like our country, often shows a kind of mutually suspicious hostile behavior.</p>
