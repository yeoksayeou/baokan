<p>時評</p>
<h3>論國聯與日本·元</h3>
<p>今日路透倫敦電稱。華盛頓許多人士意見。國聯之命運。今繫於國聯大會對李頓報告書之行動。又稱各專家大都預料。國聯將與日本分裂。夫國聯對於李頓報告書。能否以維護會。章尊嚴之精神。處理中日問題。誠爲國聯成敗之關頭。至預料國聯將與日本分裂。則吾人尙未敢信其爲正確也。</p>
<p>近來國際間要人。在壇玷上發言。無不堂皇冠冕。侃侃然誓本和平精神。堅守世界正義。然進而按之事實。則言動實不相符。即如昨日内瓦國聯行政院會議。主席凡勒拉。於提議考慮日本請求展期討論以前。先表示一番對於日本不待李頓報告書發表。而遽即承認滿洲之惋惜。且認此舉足以妨礙爭端之解决。但一面對於日本之請求。則又表示接受。雖經我代表顔博士盡力反對。而卒歸於無效。可知今日外交界要人之言論與行動。並不相符。表面上雖擁護國聯尊嚴而實際仍惟强權之命是聽。惟日本之意思是從。吾人觀此一事。即可知國聯與日本分裂。其機尙遠也。</p>
<p>日人自强估我東三省後。在外交上完全利用其延宕政策。以取得勝利。歷次國聯會議。其外交代表所採用之延宕手段。無論其爲正用或側用反用。無一不水到渠成。如願以去。即如調查團之遣派。爲日本最巧妙最得意收效又最宏大之延宕政策。利用此延宕之時間。一方在滿洲可以盡量進展。一方在外交可以從容布置。在此半年餘調查之時間。日本所加於滿洲之種種壓迫。所施於國際間之種種挑撥。國聯諸要人。當無不洞悉其底藴。乃今日猶能遷就其展期討論之請求。是非不知日本之請求爲延宕之又一計。直知其延宕之有利於日。而故予以便宜也。在此李登報告萬分嚴秘萬分緊要之時。乃曲從其無理由之請求。故予日本以施展手段之便宜。是果主持尊嚴之國聯所應許耶。</p>
<p>日來國際間每多作樂觀論調。或謂國聯仍與美一致主張公道。對於中日問題。必不有所偏袒。或謂法國已聲明擁護國聯。决不袒日。是殆即國聯與日本分裂之豫料所由來也。然我謂以今日情勢論。國聯縱欲維持其命運。敷衍國聯尊嚴之面具。至多恐亦不過遵從李登報告而止。决不能於李登報告外。再加我以何種助力。然據各方所述。李登報告之内容。僅予我以東三省宗主權之空名。夫我國人之所以極力與日抗者。豈爭此東三省之空名哉。美報論國聯。謂國聯如放棄反對日本佔據東三省之立場。及考慮外乎該地爲中國</p>
<p>整個部分之主張。則即表示國聯盟約第十條之無效。國聯今日。能毅然有此覺悟而堅决實行之乎。如其不能。則於我又有奚益。國人今尙未忘其依賴國聯。我恐國人聞此樂觀之論調。而益堅其依賴。怠我自救之心也。故再申言以警之。</p>

<p>項之政治的解决、故將報告書之審議延期、此説較爲樂觀、其悲觀論者則謂、美國將於十一月八日選舉大總統、待事畢後美國政情之安定、再取國聯與美國之共同動作、故而延期云、但上兩説皆難置信、日外務省方面則不問客觀的情勢若何、决於理事會與總會堅持旣定方針云、</p>

<h3>孫科昨日蒞滬</h3>
<p>▲張惠長傅秉常等同來</p>
<p>▲孫否認復長行政院説</p>
<p>▲謂暫不入京亦不北上</p>
<p>中委孫科夫婦·偕同張惠長·傅秉常·陳君璞·吳尙鷹·等、昨晨十時、乘加拿大皇后輪由港抵滬、孫氏否認復長行政院之説、並謂在滬休養、暫不入京、亦不北上、對内政不願有所表示、茲將孫氏抵滬情形、及其談話、分述如次、</p>
<p>▲歡迎人員　孫氏等所乘之昌興公司加拿大皇后輪、於昨晨六時三十分即抵吳淞、因潮汛關係、停泊淞口海面、並不進口、故該公司泊新關碼頭之渡輪、於昨晨五時、即開淞接客、楊虎·陳劍如·梁寒操·馬超俊·劉維熾·及市政府公安局代表等、均乘渡輪、直赴淞口迎迓、其餘如孫之戚友鄭洪年·陳炳謙·羅泮輝·陳興漢·等二十餘人、則在新關碼頭迎候、渡輪於七時許抵淞口、因檢疫醫生、到時較緩、故守候殊久、至八時許、始獲登大輪、晤及孫氏等、旋於十時十五分、乘原渡輪、抵新關碼頭、孫氏夫婦登陸後、逕返莫利愛路私寓休息、</p>
<p>▲孫氏談話　孫氏於昨午在莫利愛路寓邸、接見各報社記者、據談、最近在港曾晤及胡展堂先生、胡氏病已痊愈、現尙留港、無北來意、外傳粤方將召集三中全會、此事余無所聞、然事實上不致出此、本人此次來滬、係因内人患病初愈、故伴同來滬、遷地休養、昨傳余將重長行政院、實屬不確、余暫不入京、亦不北上云云、</p>
<h3>孫科氏夫婦在新關碼頭上車時攝影（新聲社攝）</h3>
<p>▲國際形勢　孫氏旋又談及國際形勢之轉變、及外交問題、據謂、近閲報得悉法國將變更其遠東政策、此誠國際形勢之一大轉變、實有利於我國、蓋以最近德國提出軍備平等之要求、態度强硬、並以不出席軍縮會議爲要挾、法國爲切身之利害計、乃不得不積極聯英、以壓德、致不惜變更其遠東政策、以爲交換條件、果爾、則日本在國際間、勢必陷於孤立、日本昔日之所以敢蔑視國聯、而驕恣跋扈者、全賴法國爲其後盾耳、若法果變更其袒日之遠東政策、則國聯之力量絕强、可使有效之壓迫於日本、予我國外交上以莫大之轉機、如我國此時能運用外交政策、在海洋方面、聯絡英美、在大陸方面、聯絡蘇俄、則日本將無所施其伎倆矣、然我國總須内部有辦法、否則祗賴他人、亦難望獲最後之勝利也云云、</p>
<p>▲張惠長談　記者昨在輪次訪晤張惠長氏、張談、此次來滬、完全爲私人行動、對於國内政局之不良、張氏頗致扼腕、謂當此國難時期、仍有人勇於私鬥、不特貽譏全世、且足使海外僑胞失望、張氏並舉淞滬戰爭時、僑胞捐金救國一事爲證、謂海外僑胞、前以滬戰失敗、在於缺乏空軍、乃發起募集飛機救國捐、每一僑胞、均須納相當資金、其總數達五百餘萬、當時航空署方面、並派員前往接洽、事將有成、而粤戰突起、僑胞一腔熱血之愛國心、乃歸泡影、此舉迄今、無形延擱、惟曾表示、祖國一旦而有對外戰爭、則仍可繼續前此偉舉也、僑胞熱烈愛國、於此可窺一斑也云云、</p>

<p>▲租界情形　租界區阿拉白司脱路隆源絲廠、昨晨照例鳴放汽笛、催促女工上工、但無一工人進廠、故該廠即將絲車停歇、其他各絲廠則多未放汽笛、罷工女工亦均靜守家中聽候解决、情形頗安、</p>
<p>閘北防範　自虹口租界兩區絲廠先後發生罷工後、閘北區因防範嚴密、幸未波及、昨晨各絲廠上工時由六區繅絲業工會全體理事、偕同職員等分赴各絲廠門首守候、勸導女工切勿輕舉妄動、致工潮愈形擴大、同時公安局亦派有警士保護、故上工時秩序甚佳午後上工、亦未發生其他舉動、</p>

<p>▲勞資意見　虹口租界區絲廠工人罷工後、絲廠業同業公會委員沈驊臣、前晚曾約第三區繅絲業工會理事楊叔梅交換意見、聞對於各廠延長工作時間、由同業公會負責、向各廠勸告、工作時間、不得超過十一小時其他各項、均詳加研究、結果尙稱滿意、故工潮或可不致擴大</p>

<h3>全滬矚目之高級單打網球複賽</h3>
<p>鄭兆佳可勝而失敗於德孚</p>
<p>▲勝勢轉爲敗局|千六百人同聲嘆惜</p>
<p>▲球藝全場稱賞|雖失三盤曾經劇戰</p>
<p>|邱飛海二比一勝林寳華尙待續賽|</p>
<p>昨日上海草地網球會之高級單打複賽、上海之四騎士相逢、鄭兆佳對德孚、林寳華對邱飛海、吸引觀者達一千六七百人、爲本屆網球賽初有之盛况、大戰結果、鄭兆佳不幸在可勝之形勢失敗於德孚、然鄭之表演、大受稱賞、毫無欵義、將來必爲冠軍、林寳華邱飛海之戰、則邱以二比一盤居林寳華之先、以天黑停賽續賽日期、明日公布、德孚將與邱或林决賽、奪今年之錦標、</p>
<h3>▲鄭兆佳雖敗猶榮</h3>
<p>▲上場之精彩　鼓掌聲中、一老將一少年豋塲作戰、鄭兆佳首先供球、連送四計、又失一局、然而不慌不忙、第三局亦以凈四回奉之、接連獲勝三局、三比二反而居上、鄭大施左右角之東西遠近抽擊、德孚疲於奔命、再戰而又成五比三之大優勝形勢、再勝一局、鄭卽可先聲奪人、棋可先下一着、</p>
<p>▲痛心之失敗　此决第一盤勝負之第九局、鄭果然又以主比一點佔先、再勝一點、卽告解决、出人意料、德孚竟成挽成三比三點於是經過二次之相等、鄭兆佳遂失去此最關緊要之一局、次局德孚發球、五比五打成平手、局面爲之大變、勝負亦成渺茫六比六、七比七、凡發球者比勝、八比八九比九、發球者、又皆失敗、鄭兆佳終以十比十二失此第一盤、</p>
<p>▲元氣遂大傷　此極有把握之第一盤、奪於手中而失去、一鼓勇氣、究受挫折、第二盤乃遜於第一盤、德孚旣過此難關、第二盤大爲得勢、突以五比二獲勝勢、鄭兆佳雖奮勇力進、奪得二盤、仍以四比六、再失第二盤、鄭之元氣、已受大傷、第三盤遂成不治之局一比一後、連失五盤、一比六、爲德孚連勝三盤、</p>
<p>▲鄭兆佳不錯　鄭兆佳雖以三盤失敗、而其間經過之劇戰、一目瞭然、鄭兆佳第一盤之表演、出神入化老將大有自嘆不如之槪、姿式之美、全滬獨一、東西左右遠近之各式置球、德孚接應不暇二次跳起半塲中之殺球、完全如吾人圖畫中所見之鮑羅屈拉、此種殺球、亦惟有德孚能回答之、東西邊線之削射、疾而準、亦曾獲分不少、各種擊法、完全已入門徑、再加工夫、使有把握、乃爐火純青、所需注意者、瞻力尙小、舉止尙遲、使可殺之球、失之交臂、殺之者、人能回答、球之速度、尙可大加、如此則十全十美、以此成績對台維斯杯名將、雖敗猶榮、前程無限、兆佳勉之、</p>
<p>▲德孚可佩服　德孚之最後二盤表演、已完全恢復其去年得錦標時之黃金時代、眞所謂棋逢敵手、不少鄭兆佳極難接之球、德孚無不救之、上綱殺、身高手長、一揮卽是、發球不下林寳華之急、力則過之、劈殺清脆、不愧名將、鄭兆佳曾求敎其下、對於鄭之猛晉、亦時露喜色不已、</p>
<h3>▲邱飛海佔居勝</h3>
<p>▲擊法完全不同　邱林繼鄭德之賽而起作戰、二人擊法完全與上組不同、口味爲之一換、鄭之攻德、完全用有方法之計劃極明清之攻擊、邱林二人、已深知你我、林乃於起首六局中、皆以斬球取敵、使邱不能用其底線猛抽、然效用甚微、各得其發球局、三比三後、邱突然擊破林之發球、遂繼續用其最擅長之角球抽射、間亦上網、用輕球攔殺、連勝二局、再以六比四勝第一盤、</p>
<p>▲苦戰在第三盤　林以四比六失第一盤、第二盤形勢更劣、大有不堪維持之勢、出球亦無把握、遂任邱控制一切、一連串下五局、林於此得一局、一比六未曾全軍覆沒、緊要關頭全在此第三盤、邱得之則勝、林得之尙可挽回、林以極頂聰明之上網、三比一、四比二、聲勢大振、然二人已精疲力竭矣、邱奮全力進取、攻成四比四、而以五比四追出、林之勝負、全决於此第十局、幸歸林供球、天已薄暮、秋風刺人、如懸鐘之搖蕩二人奪此最後數局、六六、七七、八八、九九、凡發球者皆勝卒以邱之不能支持、林乃以十一比九、奪回此第三盤、留得一線生機在焉、</p>
<p>▲勝負尙難逆料　天將昏黑、裁判員宣告停戰、續賽之期、尙待今日商議、明日公布、兩人勝負、尙不可説、恢復精力後、邱之機會雖多、林亦或能改變局面林之表演、已較去年進步、抽球亦大有可觀、惜由此取勝者不多、以斬球上攔克敵者屢屢、其發球邱已窺其秘、其最大弱點、逢至緊要關頭、不能抓緊而失去、邱飛海則不改故態、仍依其舊、安靜穩健以長抽制敵、間以施美妙之攔殺、誰勝誰負尙須待分解、</p>
<p>▲陳家球打開紀錄　下半時易門再戰、東華右翼曹秋亭退、由虞添代理斯職、陳洪光補入中鋒、形勢大爲轉機、約七八分鐘時、陳洪光接得後方之傳球、挑送右方、陳家球見球順勢反鈎、正對門角、西　守門欲仆地挽救、而球已越頭頂入門、東華遂開紀錄、四座歡呼之聲、震及遐邇、</p>
<p>▲陳洪光孤軍破關　東華勝球以後、勝勢益盛、又越二三分鐘、李義臣曾攻入一球、以越位作廢、迨二十餘分鐘、西捕正侵入東華内部、其内衛亦匀立於中線地點、不提防東華内衛將球送出、球過西捕内衛之身、陳洪光見機衝上、單槍匹馬、浩浩蕩蕩、殺奔西捕門前、彼内衛追逐不及、陳洪光進至門下、一踢入門、東華乃勝兩球、</p>
<p>▲陳家球遠身再中　斯時東華軍容威嚴、有不可一世之槪、西捕雖時圖反攻、冀收桑榆、無如李關二將、防禦周密、前衛亦控制得法、使西捕前鋒、不敢深入、往後東華雄兵再進、西捕内部、戰雲緊張、惟前車旣失、後軫宜戒、西捕不得不吃緊防衛、東華竟不易深入、憑陳家球遠射之猛急、攻入一球、結果遂成三比零、東華大勝、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>二一枝譚</p>
<h3>婦女截髮和愛國</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>想不到截髮以後的婦女，是這般奢靡妖豔勝過丁沒有截髮的婦女|伊們　成一次鬏曲髮的代價，數十塊錢是不足爲奇的；從前沒有截髮時，便是雇用着梳頭娘姨也用不了這許多錢。</p>
<p>歷史上的名譽截髮者，當然要推譽截髮留賓的陶母。</p>
<p>伊爲着鼓勵兒子的學問起見，把截髮賣米的錢，替兒了子留賢寳；伊的兒子便是陶侃，成爲一代重要人物：伊培成了兒子的學問去救國，伊的截髮便是愛國。</p>
<p>甲午年中日戰爭，日本孀婦氏家直子，提倡截髮救國，約齊了許多同志，把萬名婦女頭上剪下的長髮，製成軍艦的長纜，好鼓勵伊們丈夫或兒子的努力作戰，伊們的截髮便是愛國。</p>
<p>暹羅的截髮婦女，是全國一致的：據説：截髮的起因，是爲着昔年和緬甸交戰，犧牲了許多壯士：緬兵愈迫愈近，甚至把都城包圍的異常嚴密。全城婦女又悲又憤，便即一律截髮當兵·上城防守：到了後來，竟把緬兵打敗，解去重圍，婦女們相沿成俗，便永遠薙髮了：伊們的截髮也是愛國。</p>
<p>我要向摩登太太，摩登奶奶，摩登姑娘打一個問訊；</p>
<p>諸位女菩薩，截去烏雲髮，有什麽作用，而現身説法？</p>
<p>是培植令郎成就學業，以便努力救國麽？</p>
<p>是製成艦纜，供給海軍，以雪我九一八的奇恥麽？</p>
<p>是投身行伍，戮力守城，準備把敵軍打個落花流水麽？</p>
<h3>科學家的特性</h3>
<p>— 潛</p>
<p>|我的推想|</p>
<p>我小時熱慕着科學家！記得十年前我在小學裏讀書，有一本學生雜誌上印了許多科學家的照相，我左看右看的足足看了一個鐘頭，我又拿鏡子細細照我自已，末了，我問我姑母説：（我同這上頭有一個人像麽？）姑母説：（個個都像你，）（哈哈！）我大笑一陣，現在想起來，這一頁上盡是此美國極著名的工程師與科學家，像愛迪生，斯坦墨茲，萊特，······莫説我的像不像他們的萬分之一，恐怕連他們僕人的像也比不上呢。</p>
<p>不過據我現在的觀察與推想，科學家不僅有特殊的像貌而已，似乎還有其特殊的性情，什麽特殊的性情呢？大槪如下：</p>
<p>第一，科學家是樸實的他們辛辛苦苦的爲人類工作，自已却樸質的很，像斯坦墨茲，他只要有雪茄烟有小獸就夠了，我國科學界名人，亦大半穿着粗布衣服。</p>
<p>第二，科學家是忠實的他們沒有機詐的思想，他們的心和小孩一般的乾凈，機詐，欺騙，利用，狡滑，只有政治</p>
<p>家曉得。</p>
<p>第三，科學家是極耐勞苦的不然他們那能完成那偉大的科學工作呢，愛迪生能幾晝夜不睡覺，這是全世界聞名的。</p>
<p>第四，科學家是極沉靜的他們的工作，心須殫精竭慮，盡力赴之，因此他們的心地是異常的沉靜（泰山崩於前，而色不變；麋鹿興於左，而目不瞬。）科學家確有這種態度。讀者如不信，不妨請敎一位有名的學者，一定看得出他是如何的沉靜！</p>
<p>我們中國缺少的，不是洋博士，而是（貨眞價實）的（中國式）的（中國工程師與科學家）。中國的（國産）工程師與科學家要能和（政治家）一般多，中國早已坐世界第一把交椅了！</p>
<h3>俏皮話</h3>
<p>— ·梯·公</p>
<p>某官僚死後，在閻羅殿下，極口呼寃。閻王怪問其故。官僚道：（下官素來身體壯實，近日家居，每天還玩個十六圈麻雀，何以糊裏糊塗，忽加勾攝？）閻王冷笑道：（本來你陽壽未絕，大有可爲。誰呌你這孽障，一行作吏，便喝了小老婆的洗脚水，專一爭風吃醋摜紗帽，哭臥上吊裝假病。共總做了三年官，倒生了九十八場病，本殿額外施恩，有意成全了你，省得再在陽世殃民誤國。）</p>
<p>煤炭店的小開，問他父親道：（你在報上豋的什麽愛國之心，未敢後人，那末人家在東北打仇人，你老人家怎麽不去呢？）他父親笑道，（痴孩子，連這點都不懂。我説愛國之心，未敢厚人，便是愛家之心，未敢薄已。人家打人家的仗，愛他的國，我買我的黑貨，愛我的家我要愛國之心，比人家厚，不是太不客氣嗎？）小開恍然道：（怪不得天天在報上看見這八　字，原來是這麽一個解釋。）</p>
<h3>做官與求愛</h3>
<p>— ·蔣·潔·如</p>
<p>|兩件事是一般的性質|</p>
<p>做官與求愛，性質是相同的。第一相同之點是兩件事同樣需要（錢）。</p>
<p>第二相同之點是（身份）。</p>
<p>做官雖然靠鑽營　，然而離不掉身份；有了某種身份，才會去鑽營某種官。假如一個小小的錄事忽然想去運動當省政府主席，非但不可能，簡實是笑天下之大話！</p>
<p>歷史上雖有（平地一聲雷）的事情，然而這已是歷史上的事情了。</p>
<p>同樣，找戀愛也要顧身份。人力車夫决不會向一位女敎授（進攻）：倘然有一個烟兑店的學徒忽然做一個（和大學皇后結婚）的夢，那眞是心理上一種奇異現像，|這種奇異現像，可以供心理學家作研究（奇夢）的參考。</p>
<p>書本上雖有（變愛無階級）的話，然而這終究是書本上的話。</p>
<h3>女子美容的轉變</h3>

<p>|淡裝濃抹循環而已|</p>
<p>現在，愛美的摩登女郎，誰都歡喜把眉兒畫得烏黑而長長的，把嘴唇抹得殷紅如血的，把臉兒塗得雪白的，濃裝艷抹，如花如玉，可謂美到極點了！</p>
<p>我們回想到十餘年前，那時，繁華的都市裏，女學校裏的女學生跑出來，都是洗凈鉛華，丰韻天然，人家都嘖嘖的稱讚伊們的天然美。於是未進學校的奶奶小姐們，也都十分羨慕伊們，於是却嫌脂粉污顔色，而競作淡裝了。那時候，祇有一些半老徐娘，和操皮肉生涯的娼妓，還在塗着濃脂，抹着厚粉，畫着黑眉，我們見了，認爲奇怪的冶容，忍俊不住，會駡伊們是妖精哩。這時候，摩登女郎的美容，是崇尙天然美的淡裝啊！</p>
<p>呀！時尙轉變，眞匪夷所思，在最近的三四年來，愛美而善修容的摩登女郎們，又厭惡淡裝，而愛塗脂抹粉畫眉毛了，這是女子美容的又一轉變啦！</p>
<p>伊們對於美容，是在鈎心鬥巧，隨時變化而翻新，説不定在最近的將來，</p>
<p>又會厭棄濃艷而復歸淡素哩。哦，翻來翻去，或濃或淡，不外循環而已吧？</p>

<h3>説部扶輪會銀絲（二十四）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>（十二）</p>
<p>大家在鼓噪，諸伯方猛然地一驚，從梯子跌了下來，而袁瘋子却一陣怪笑，也從上面往人叢中縱身躍下。</p>
<p>縣長和公安局長都怒極了，立刻下命令，敎警察去把袁瘋子抓起來，預備重辦。</p>
<p>正在這時候，袁團長也驚得呆了，他仔細地瞧着，他已認出這是他以前所遺棄的妻子。他狠躊躇，不知道應該聽任羣衆們去處置，還是宣布給大衆知道，不許大衆駡伊打伊？但是在這一刹那之間，袁瘋子已跳下了地，跌得頭破血淋。羣衆非常憤怒伊破壞莊嚴典禮的秩序，正想圍攏來兇毆，</p>
<p>袁團長狠敏捷的在臺上高聲地喊道：（大家不要動蠻）|他一壁喊，一壁也跳下臺去，用了力氣，在人叢中擠了過去，把袁瘋子抱了起來，又高喊道：（不要難爲伊，誰也不許欺侮伊）！</p>
<p>縣長和公安局長在臺上弄得莫名其妙，只駡諸伯方辦事糊塗，怎麽不仔細地檢查，竟給那個瘋婦用梯子在照壁後面爬到紀念碑上去搗亂會場。</p>
<p>袁團長抱着他妻子，已走到臺上。諸綺蘭玉容失色地，顫着聲調向袁團長道：（這瘋婦太可惡極了，團長放着伊，讓警察抓去拘禁吧！）伊取出自已繡花綢帕，給團長拭着衣袖上染着的血跡，伊絲毫不注意自已父親跌下了梯子是怎樣。</p>
<p>會場上的秩序，完全沒有了，像潮湧地都擠到臺前去看，有的還在駡瘋子，主張把伊打死；有的在讚嘆團長的仁慈；有的在笑諸綺蘭趨奉團長，簡直是無恥；還有些人，竟在喊着：（諸綺蘭！你向團長磕三個頭，也得會抱你了）。警察已失了維持秩序的能力，縣長公安局長只在面面相覻，失了威嚴。</p>
<p>諸伯方雖然從梯子跌下來，還沒受大傷，一蹺一拐地依舊走到臺上，站在團長前面去鞠躬，不敢説一句話，面色白得像死人一樣。</p>
<p>（靜些！大家不要響！）袁團長喊着，比幾十個警察的威力還要大，會場的羣衆，果然立刻靜下來。</p>
<p>（這是我失散了十餘年的妻子，我正在尋覓不到，謝謝各位，給我造了紀念碑，　得到機會遇見，眞是僥倖得狠）。袁團長宣布給羣衆聽了，全體大鼓掌。</p>
<p>（從前我因爲秘密去投軍，所以抛棄了家庭去的，想不到我的妻子，爲了我而瘋了：但是伊還生存着，我得謝謝各位在鎭上照管伊·）袁團長興奮地繼續報告　，但是平時駡伊和要打伊的人，聽着十分不安，私自便溜之大吉。</p>
<p>（這裏可有好的醫生）？袁團長問大衆。</p>
<p>（張醫生呢？唐醫生呢）？羣都是找覓鎭上惟一的醫學博士。</p>

<p>一個人當橫行不法，爲非作惡的時候，他們的心理，完全緊張，情勢激越，若一到惡貫滿盈，難逃法網，這個時候，方知悔悟，自覺不該，然而呌煞（爺叔，）也是無用。</p>
<p>昨據報載，綁匪鹽城人陳惠慶，臨刑前據供，我受歹友之愚，作此不忠不孝不仁不義之事，我今日槍斃，甚爲慚愧，要求法官不必登報，陳惠慶在做綁匪之時，完全不曉得仁義，不懂得慚愧，他到臨刑之時，方始良心發現，所謂（氏鳥之將死，其鳴也哀，人之將死，其言也善，）在做綁匪之時，完全不要面子，及至臨刑之時，方始請求法官不必登報，眞是死要面子。</p>
<p>人性本善呢？本惡呢？有善有惡呢？可善可惡呢？這個問題經幾許學者的討論，至今還成懸案，若照陳惠慶看起來，人性還是善的多數，滬上種種的罪惡，比較任何地方爲多，可知完全爲環境所造成，並非天生作惡的坯子，從前</p>

<h3>冷氣裝置談·汀·若·可·培</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>日前本欄，刋有某君（最新式冷氣裝置）文章一篇；語短辭略，不易明瞭·茲抽閒爲之擇要補述如下：</p>
<p>查冷氣機，（一名收熱機：）即係藉機械之力，將一處之熱氣，移至他處，使人處室中，絲毫不感受到酷熱氣候之影響；洵爲夏令却暑之妙器焉。</p>
<p>冷氣裝置式樣有四：（一）壓榨。（二）吸收式，（三）冷空氣式，（四）眞空式，今歐美各國所裝置者，大都爲第一式，與第二式，即就滬地已裝有冷氣機諸家而言，若匯豐銀行，匯豐大厦，華懋飯店，南京大戲院等，亦均採用壓榨式，或吸收式，至第三式效率、低，惟輪船中偶用之，某君所引爲最新之眞空式，（即第四式，）因裝設費鉅，效率不高，多數冷氣工程家已厭棄不用矣。</p>
<p>無論何種流質，如值化氣時，必吸收大量之熱力，此種熱力稱之曰，（潛熱力）凡曾讀過初等物理學者，類皆知之，故若用某種易蒸化之液體，使其在欲收熱之處，繼續蒸化，則該處一帶，所有之熱力，俱被吸收；而同時温度，亦行降低，以氣化之體質，導入壓榨室而壓榨之，此時氣體因受着大壓力發生大熱；再導至凝氣器，用冷水吸收其熱力，温度降而又凝成液體；如此循環不息，恃少量之液質，使可用之無竭。</p>
<p>易蒸化之液體，種類頗多，可供實用者，有下列四種，（一）阿莫尼亞，（二）二養化炭，（三）二養化硫，（四）一綠甲烷，　大號收熱機，咸採用阿莫尼亞爲傳質；二養化炭用諸欲使温度極底之處頗宜：至第三及第四種，則合於小規模收熱裝置之用；蓋利其無須施加大壓力；使用上，亦較爲安一也。</p>
<p>吾人如欲裝置一完善之冷氣設備，務須注意三項要素，第一須减低空氣温度；次須空氣流動；又次須空氣中所含水分减低；如其中苟有任何一項，發生缺陷，則人處冷氣空中，便立刻可感覺身心不舒適也。（却酬）</p>

<h3>關於再娶與再嫁</h3>
<p>— 史娜</p>
<p>一萍君在本會提出再娶嫁的問題之後，我很想發表一些鄙見，因爲窮忙得很，隔了幾天，才能動筆。</p>
<p>再娶是沒有問題，只要他有幾個錢，一世娶十七八個也沒有人非難他，一般社會的心理，都會默認他的當然。只有再嫁成問題。假使有一個女子，先後嫁了十七八次，就成爲大大的笑話，一般社會的心理，都要鄙棄賤視也了。這是多麽矛盾的心理|男子可以再娶，女子當然可权再嫁，這是天經地義的道理，有什麽兩樣呢！</p>
<p>説到現在的寡婦，可分兩種：一種想再嫁而不得再嫁，一種不想再嫁而反迫成再嫁，想嫁不想再嫁，本來是各人的自由；換句話説，這是個個人應有的（人權）。伹中國女子，幾千年來，在三從四德的重重束縛之下，所有人權，早被禮敎先生所侵蝕。一旦有個寡婦，想再嫁的就再嫁，不想再嫁的就不嫁，已沒有這麽容易。而且，再嫁問題，是婦女問題之一，婦女問題整個的解决之後，則再嫁也就不成問題。而且，婦女問題是女子的自身問題，女子自身問題，應由女子自已起來解决，才能眞正的解决，才能澈底的解决。現在的女子，大多數不但不能起來解决，而且還是不知起來解决。所以我們現在當前的應做的重要工作，還在使女子自已知道起來解决。等到女子知道自已起來解决自已的切身問題時，她要再嫁，就再嫁，她要守寡，就守寡。而且她要嫁給張三，就嫁給張三，她要嫁給李四，就嫁給李四，誰也不能過問，誰也不配過問。</p>
<p>這種現象，我們自然希望最近的將來能夠實現。但我們現在可以做點救急的工作。比如有一個寡婦，也很想再嫁而不得，我們應該指引她，指引她到婦女協會裏去求助，指引她到婦女救濟會裏去設法；我們再要激勵她，促其覺悟，促其爲自已的正當幸福而奮鬥。</p>
<p>我的鄰居，如果有這種女子，我極願意這麽做。我想一萍君和高明的讀者，也是極願意盡這點義務的吧！</p>

<h3>連擋碼子</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>一别三月的上海，這回又來小住了雨宵，跑在馬路裏看看，大廉價的旗幟，到處飛舞，紅男綠女，又不住的脇下夾着七包八裏，在各種大商店裏，如潮般地，一羣一羣的出來，亮得使我見了張不開眼的摩托卡，車頭上點上兩盞帶着勢利的情緒的，像活老虎眼睛般的車電燈，如梭般地往來不絕，紅黃藍白黑的腦袋，（帽子的顔色）擠上擠下，像糞蛆般的望過去，沒有散開的一霎，唉|誰還看得出，這是在不久的以前，曾經遭過敵人的慘酷的摧殘的一個戰區？唉|誰還看得出，這般是身上背着泰山般重的國難的，亡國就在目前的人民，照這狀態看來，簡直是一個昇平世界，鼓腹乾坤。</p>
<p>吃了夜飯，因爲到上海來，所應做的任務，已經完了，坐在旅館裏，覺得氣悶，看戲，逛游戲塲，和ＸＸ，都非性之所好，所以祗得去蕩蕩馬路，看看兩旁商店玻璃裏，擺各花花陸陸，飽飽我兩隻眼福，詢之同伴尤君，也贊成逛這個免票的，經濟的，擴大游戲塲，於是兩人就跑出旅館，無目的地去東走走，西逛逛，</p>
<p>信步走來，不覺已走到了那條上海最富麗，也即全中國最繁華的南京路上，兩人在水門汀階上，照着商店玻璃窗外，一路看去，有時，看見了那價目牌上，標着數字多的昻貴東西，大家都伸了伸舌頭，搖了搖腦袋，窮措大的寒酸狀態，立刻充分地流露了出來，</p>
<p>（先生|請問ＸＸ路，　　樣走法？）一個商人模樣的男子，向着老尤打着問訊，（轉灣就是|）老尤把右手指着左面一條橫馬路，回答着説，</p>
<p>（謝謝你）男子得了方向，大踏步地走開了，</p>
<p>一霎時，老尤突然喊着，（啊唷唷窮禍了，皮夾逃走了），我聽了，馬上問他，幾時失掉的，他説，剛才踏上水門汀的时候，我還好端端用手，在長衫袋外面，揪着，祇有現在，因爲回答那人問路，指示他方向，才得把手一鬆，後來就覺着不見了，但是那人問訊的時候，站在我的面前，所以决不是他撬去的，不要寃枉他，</p>
<p>回到旅館，我想想，那個問訊的人，總究帶着重大嫌疑，後來被我想出了，一定是那問訊的人，和那個扒手，是連擋碼子，看見老尤長衫袋凸出，知道大拉司不少在裏面，但是他用五位看財童子，看守着，使他們難越雷池一步，於是用個調虎離山妙計，一個人假做來問訊，待你把手一鬆，後面一個，就好乘虚而入，只要研究他，ＸＸ路，就在目前，他怎會不知道，况且他要你舉右手，所以特地問你左面的路徑，這個豈不是他們一套連擋的把戲嗎，老尤聽了，不由的直跳起來，嘴裏連説。（對啊對啊），</p>

<h3>史先生的賭博</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>史先生近來幾乎天天打牌，這是他從前所沒有的行動。他想：（我爲什麽會這樣愛好打牌的？我從前不是絕對不打析嗎？哦|這賭博的引誘力眞是大啊！）他所得的結論如此而已。</p>
<p>但是最值得史先生氣忿的便是每次打牌老是輪，一次輪，二次輪，三次四次·····還是輪，於是結算起來，一個禮拜以來已經輪了二十幾元了。雖然這並不是一個如何大、的數目，可是在一個月只有五六十元收入的他，却是一個很大的數字了。即使到月底才結算，以後還有贏的希望，但是這種希望到底是沒有如何保障的呀。</p>
<p>到夜半當他睡在床上的時候，他默默地想：</p>
<p>（哎！今天又輪了五元多，手風眞是不好呀！不過那一副筒子清三翻確是打錯了；自己已經碰了四和下檯，大家都知道我在做筒子了，手裏還有三筒一坎，二筒一隻，可以和一四筒和二筒單吊，那末對門打三筒便不應該槓的，可是自已却爲了那槓上開花加一翻槓了下來，於是大家一張筒子也不打，接上自已便摸四筒······一個四翻始終沒有和下來。多麽可惜啊！否則，五百和滿貫，自已又是莊家，三五一十五，一下便是十五千······。哎·我打牌不行，太外行了，以後絕對不打，不打總無從輪去的。······可是不打又怎樣呢？難道就不要翻本嗎？難道就甘願孝敬他們這二十幾隻老洋嗎？······）</p>
<p>於是這使他十分難堪。紅中碰，發財槓，眼前所閃爍的完全是牌，萬子一色，大三元對對和三坎加翻，再兼東風兩翻，······假如能夠這樣照理想的和下來，還怕贏錢嗎？而且他只有那勉强夠用的幾塊錢，那裏有多餘的錢來還牌賬呢？</p>
<p>第二天他費了一個早晨的工夫，想着一個最妙的方法，那便是專做無么平和；這種兩翻比較容易，别人不會注意。四十和底的話，和下來有一百六十和，多麽容易呀！他認爲這簡直是（打牌哲學）。</p>
<p>這末一來，果然他翻本了不少，可是人總是貪心的，尤其是在資本主義的社會中；贏了還想贏，於是多打了幾次，他又是輪了，而且比以前輪得更多。於是他開始覺得毫無辦法了。</p>
<p>今天我遇着他頽喪的臉色，我下意識的問他，蒙他告訴我近日來的經過；於是我勸慰他説：</p>
<p>（朋友！打牌究竟是有錢的老爺太太們的玩意兒，他們有的是錢，輪贏不算一回事，像我們窮小子配打牌嗎？拿什麽錢來打呀？你一上塲便擔心輪，你愈擔心輪便愈是輪因爲那多少是以精神好壞爲歸依的。所以還是不打爲是。）</p>
<p>（是，是，······）</p>
<p>我看見他在不住的點頭。</p>

<h3>On the League of Nations and Japan - 1</h3>
<p>Today, Reuters London reported that many people in Washington believe the fate of the League of Nations now hinges on the League Assembly's action on the Lytton Report. It also stated that most experts predict the League of Nations will split with Japan. Whether the League of Nations can handle the Sino-Japanese problem with the spirit of upholding the dignity of its charter is indeed the key to the League's success or failure. As for the prediction that the League of Nations will split with Japan, we dare not believe it to be correct yet.</p>
<p>Recently, international dignitaries have made speeches in public, all sounding grand and eloquent, solemnly vowing to adhere to the spirit of peace and uphold world justice. However, upon closer examination of the facts, their words and actions are not consistent. For example, at yesterday's League of Nations Council meeting in Geneva, Chairman Varela, before proposing to consider Japan's request for an extension of the discussion period, first expressed regret that Japan had immediately recognized Manchuria without waiting for the release of the Lytton Report, and recognized that this action would hinder the resolution of the dispute. However, on the one hand, he expressed acceptance of Japan's request. Although our representative, Dr. Yan, did his best to object, it ultimately proved ineffective. It can be seen that the words and actions of today's diplomatic dignitaries do not match. On the surface, they support the dignity of the League of Nations, but in reality, they only listen to the dictates of power, following Japan's wishes. Observing this incident, we can see that the split between the League of Nations and Japan is still a long way off.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese seized our three eastern provinces, they have completely utilized their delaying tactics in diplomacy to achieve victory. In every League of Nations meeting, the delaying tactics adopted by their diplomatic representatives, whether used directly, indirectly, or inversely, have all been successful. For example, the dispatch of the investigation team was Japan's most ingenious, most successful, and most effective delaying tactic. Utilizing this delay, they could advance as much as possible in Manchuria and make arrangements calmly in diplomacy. During the half-year of the investigation, the various oppressions Japan imposed on Manchuria and the various provocations it instigated internationally were undoubtedly understood by all the dignitaries of the League of Nations. Yet today, they can still accommodate its request for an extension of the discussion period. Is it because they are unaware that Japan's request is another delaying tactic, or do they know that the delay is beneficial to Japan and deliberately give it an advantage? At this time when the Lytton Report is extremely confidential and extremely important, they actually comply with its unreasonable request, giving Japan the convenience to carry out its schemes. Is this what a League of Nations upholding dignity should allow?</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many optimistic views internationally, saying that the League of Nations still maintains fairness in concert with the United States, and will not be biased in the Sino-Japanese issue. Or saying that France has declared its support for the League of Nations and will definitely not side with Japan. This is probably the source of the prediction of a split between the League of Nations and Japan. However, I say that based on the current situation, even if the League of Nations wants to maintain its fate and put on the facade of the League's dignity, at most, it will probably only follow the Lytton Report. It will definitely not give us any further assistance beyond the Lytton Report. However, according to various reports, the content of the Lytton Report only gives us the empty name of sovereignty over the three eastern provinces. Is it this empty name of the three eastern provinces that our people are fighting so hard against Japan for? An American newspaper commented on the League of Nations, saying that if the League of Nations abandons its position of opposing Japan's occupation of the three eastern provinces and considers arguments other than that the area is an integral part of China, it would be tantamount to declaring Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant invalid. Can the League of Nations today have this firm realization and resolutely implement it? If it cannot, then what benefit will it be to us? Our people have not yet forgotten their reliance on the League of Nations. I fear that our people will hear these optimistic views and strengthen their reliance, neglecting our own efforts to save ourselves. Therefore, I repeat my warning to alert them.</p>
<p>Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>The Central Government Plans to Handle the Han-Liu Conflict</h3>
<p>Liu Zhennian to Reduce Defense Zone and Return Political Power</p>
<p>Supplementary Military Expenses for Liu's Division at 140,000 per Month</p>
<p>Nanjing - Regarding the Han-Liu conflict, the Central Government has repeatedly issued strict orders to stop it and has formulated peaceful measures to resolve it quickly. The content of the measures is said to include: (1) Liu Zhennian's defense zone in Jiaodong originally included more than ten counties. Now, the defense zone will be reduced, and several counties will be designated as Liu's garrison area. (2) The administrative and financial powers of all counties in Jiaodong will be handled by the provincial government without interference. (3) The abandoned defense areas will be filled by other troops. (4) Supplementary military expenses for Liu's division will be 140,000 per month to maintain operations. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing - One of the reasons for the Han-Liu conflict is the uneven distribution of military expenses. Chen Yi, the Minister of Military Affairs, replied to Liu Zhennian, stating that regarding the request for 140,000 yuan per month for your division, as per the previous telegram, the Ministry has already sent another letter to the Ministry of Finance requesting that 40,000 yuan be deducted monthly from the 600,000 yuan allocated to Han's division and added to your division. There has been no reply yet. We have sent another letter urging them. Once the reply is received, you will be notified separately. If the Ministry of Finance is unable to increase the allocation, the Ministry will find other ways to add 12,000 yuan per month from September onwards to reach 80% of the 140,000 yuan to maintain operations. (25th Dispatch)</p>

A severe warning has been sent to Commander Liu. We are telegraphed to inform you. We hope you will report the situation there at any time." Also, Liu Zhi replied to Han's telegram, saying, "Brother has ceased military action on the matter of Liu Zhennian and is awaiting handling by the Central Government, which proves that you value the nation and the people above all else, and are generous-minded, which is admirable."

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>The Fate of the League of Nations Depends on the Handling of the Sino-Japanese Case</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Spares No Effort to Accommodate Japan</p>
<p>Avoiding a Head-On Conflict with Japan</p>
<p>Japan Expresses Determination to Advance According to Its Established Policy</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th: According to a New York correspondent for the Observer, many people in Washington believe that the fate of the League of Nations now depends on the actions of the League of Nations General Assembly regarding the Lytton Report. American newspapers believe that if the League of Nations abandons its position against Japan's occupation of the three northeastern provinces and considers claims that are outside of that area as part of China as a whole, it will indicate the invalidity of Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant and be equivalent to members of the League of Nations disregarding previous commitments. Experts generally expect the League of Nations to split with Japan, but they do not want to make other speculations beyond this. (Note: Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant states that members of the League of Nations undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the existing territorial integrity and political dependence of all members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.)</p>
<p>Reuters Clarification: In the last night's telegram from Geneva on the 24th, the second line from the end ("The period of re-extension shall not exceed two weeks") should have read "one week" instead of "two weeks."</p>
<p>Dentus, Tokyo, 25th: The League of Nations Council decided to begin deliberations on the Lytton Report on November 14, while the Special General Assembly was postponed to late December. It is said that the reason for the League of Nations' caution regarding the report is that the League is trying to prevent Japan from withdrawing from the League of Nations and is seeking some kind of political solution in the interval between Japan's recognition of Manchukuo and the report. This is a more optimistic view. Pessimists say that the United States will hold presidential elections on November 8, and the League of Nations and the United States will take joint action after the American political situation stabilizes, so the meeting is postponed. However, both of these theories are difficult to believe. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will insist on its established policy at the Council and the General Assembly, regardless of the objective situation.</p>
<p>(1) Japan's established policy on the Manchurian issue will not change under any circumstances, and it will explain the facts to the League of Nations and other countries as much as possible to seek understanding. The Japanese representative will repeatedly explain Japan's attitude and policy at the Council. (2) As for the application of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, because of constant opposition, the Japanese representative will not officially attend the General Assembly under Article 15, but will only attend as an explanation committee to consistently implement Japan's claims at the Council. (3) If the General Assembly refers the report to the Committee of Nineteen, Japan will not participate in the committee because it absolutely opposes it.</p>
<p>Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 25th: The General Assembly of the League of Nations will convene on Sunday, which is the thirteenth regular General Assembly in the twelve years since the League of Nations was established. The agenda of this General Assembly has been largely decided as follows: After the formation of the General Assembly Presidium, the first task is to elect the President of the General Assembly, who will most likely be the Greek representative, Politis. Next, the General Assembly will discuss the work of the League of Nations for the years 1931 to 1932. This year, the majority of opinions hope to shorten the time for this discussion as much as possible, so the General Assembly may be able to begin the work of the five committees before the end of next week. These committees are divided into five categories according to past practice: law, economics, administration, and socio-politics, and they will discuss various topics on the agenda separately. The more important ones are: (1) revising the League of Nations Covenant to avoid conflict with the Paris Peace Pact; (2) the organization of the International Labour Office Secretariat; (3) the organization of the International Court of Justice. In addition, the issue of the organization of the League of Nations Secretariat is quite difficult due to the resignation of Secretary-General Drummond. At this General Assembly, the new country joining the League of Nations will be Iraq. Iraq was a mandated territory under British administration, and after the British administration was terminated and approved by the Council, it became a member state of the League of Nations. In addition, according to annual practice, three of the fourteen Council member states should be re-elected. The three member states whose terms are expiring are Poland, Yugoslavia, and Peru. According to the clear declaration of Polish representative Chalasinski, Poland has submitted its candidacy again. Because the General Assembly previously granted Poland the privilege of being re-elected consecutively, there seems to be no doubt that Poland will be re-elected this time. As for Yugoslavia's seat, the Little Entente countries have agreed that Czechoslovakia will continue to be elected this year, which is also not a problem. As for the seat of the South American republics, since Peru's term has expired, its successor seems to be Mexico, which has recently joined the League of Nations. It is generally predicted that the General Assembly will be in session for approximately two weeks this year.</p>
<h3>Japan's Propaganda to the United States</h3>
<p>The Japanese Embassy Issues a White Paper</p>
<p>Explaining its Position on the Liaoning Case</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 24th: Today, the Japanese Embassy here issued a white paper detailing Japan's position on the Manchurian case for propaganda purposes.</p>
<h3>Russo-Japanese Petroleum Contract Signed</h3>
<p>Russia Supplies 200,000 Tons of Oil to Japan</p>
<p>Russia Remains Observant on Recognizing the Puppet State</p>
<p>Tass, Moscow, 24th: Japanese merchant Matsuoka and Soviet petroleum export trust director Leba Volfov are negotiating a petroleum purchase deal here and have signed a contract. In the future, the Soviet Union will supply Japan with 200,000 tons of gasoline.</p>
<p>World Press, Kobe: Diplomatic circles and some newspapers in Japan have recently spread the rumor that Soviet Russia will soon follow in Japan's footsteps and recognize the so-called "Manchukuo." However, according to other sources, this is only Japanese propaganda. Soviet Russia's recognition will not be realized for the time being. On the one hand, the Russian government is still observing the attitude of the major powers, and on the other hand, it must obtain certain conditions from the Japanese government in exchange. As for the nature of these conditions, it is rumored to be a request to conclude a non-aggression pact with Japan. According to some reports, the Russian side did make this request, but it was rejected by the Japanese side. When Kenzaburo Arakawa returned to his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs in Moscow at the end of last year, Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov inquired about the conclusion of this treaty. Later, the Russian ambassador to Tokyo formally proposed it to Japan. After an exchange of views, the Japanese authorities have not yet officially replied to the Russian side, because the Japanese side believes that both Japan and Russia are signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and that there is no need to conclude a non-aggression pact. Moreover, concluding a treaty with Russia alone may arouse suspicion from other countries, which is harmful and unhelpful. Furthermore, it believes that recognizing Manchukuo and concluding a treaty are two separate matters and that there is no relationship between them. If the Russian government is concerned about disputes between it and Japan, it may establish a kind of understanding outside the issue of recognition. The Russian side is still observing the recognition of Manchukuo because its proposal has not been accepted.</p>
<h3>Another Diplomatic Strategy of Japan</h3>
<p>Intends to Use the Tibet Incident</p>
<p>To Divert the League of Nations' Attention</p>
<p>Dentus, Tokyo, 25th: The Japanese government is avoiding criticism of the issue of western Tibet. It is reported that the Chinese government is determined to seek a solution. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that although the issue of Manchurian independence and the issue of Tibet are different in nature, both are issues of the division of Chinese territory. However, the Chinese government will seek a solution on its own, and the League of Nations is indifferent to this, which is inconceivable. Especially in the Manchurian issue, the League of Nations is accommodating to an unnecessary extent, while in the Tibetan issue, it does not intervene. What is the reason for this?</p>
<h3>Poland Acknowledges the Puppet State Issue</h3>
<p>Will Consider France's Attitude Before Acting</p>
<p>▲ Warsaw, 24th Dispatch from Guomin News Agency: The Polish Chamber of Commerce in Harbin telegraphed the Polish government requesting recognition of the Manchurian puppet organization. The Polish government has shelved the matter. According to opinions from political circles here, the action of the Polish merchants in Harbin is merely an attempt to please the puppet organization in hopes of gaining material benefits, purely for personal gain. The Polish government will likely not take any action on this issue without first obtaining France's understanding. Although France has expressed friendliness towards Japan on the Manchurian issue, it seems that it has no intention of recognizing the puppet organization at this time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Plans to Strengthen Armaments</h3>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 25th Dispatch from Dentsu: The decided military reform has been postponed indefinitely due to the situation in Manchuria. However, the strengthening of armaments, which is a major part of the military reform, cannot be delayed any longer. The top leaders of the army have decided to plan for the strengthening of armaments from the next fiscal year. This is completely different from the original reform plan. The goals of improvement are: (1) to improve the machine guns, tanks, and infantry artillery of the infantry; (2) to strengthen the machine guns and armored vehicles of the cavalry; (3) to improve the light howitzers and anti-aircraft guns of the artillery; (4) to strengthen special forces and establish a new junior signal corps system; (5) to reorganize aviation units, update equipment, and establish a new junior aviation corps system; (6) to strengthen motor vehicles, both light and heavy; and (7) to mechanize each branch of the military and enrich educational materials. The greatest goal is to strengthen the most significant deficiency, mechanical power. The budget required to complete this strengthening plan is approximately 100 million several tens of million yen.</p>
<h3>Japanese Industrial Circles in Severe Decline</h3>
<p>Hundreds of Thousands of Workers Starving</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 25th Dispatch from Japan United Press: The Japanese silk reeling, iron manufacturing, and mining industries have been severely impacted by the economic downturn. According to an investigation by the authorities, from Showa 6 to April 1st of Showa 7, there were a total of 805 factories that had not paid workers' wages. The number of unpaid workers was over hundreds of thousands of people, and the amount owed was 2,908,500 yen. Because the matter is important, the Social Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs has decided to create a Labor Protection Law and submit it to the next session of the Diet.</p>
<h3>Osaka Academic Circles Oppose Militarism</h3>
<p>Refuse to Participate in September 18th Parade</p>
<p>Arousing the Anger of Military Authorities</p>
<p>▲ Osaka Dispatch from World News Agency: Osaka City held a large parade on September 18th to commemorate the anniversary of the Japanese army's occupation of Shenyang. At that time, almost all of the middle schools and normal schools in the prefecture did not participate. The authorities of the Fourth Division of Osaka were very displeased with this, and the matter is currently under investigation. The situation has the potential to escalate significantly. Military authorities believed beforehand that a parade of the entire city by the military alone could easily cause misunderstanding, with people assuming it was an endorsement of militarism. Therefore, they notified all sectors to participate uniformly, and the prefectural education department ordered all public and private schools in the city to participate in the parade. However, only eleven schools ultimately joined. Among the prefectural schools, all but two schools and a school managed by a French person did not participate. The Fourth Division authorities believe this is academic circles intentionally differing from the military authorities, and are greatly angered. An officer of the Fourth Division told someone that this matter is currently under investigation, and the attitude of the school authorities is truly unforgivable, especially on this great commemorative day for the nation. Our division has adopted a definite attitude towards this incident, he said.</p>
<h3>Poona Agreement Telegraphed to British Prime Minister for Consideration</h3>
<p>Gandhi's Fast Enters Fifth Day</p>
<p>Mentally Exhausted, Unable to Speak</p>
<p>Untouchable Class Already Benefited</p>
<p>▲ Poona, 24th Dispatch from Havas: Gandhi is now very exhausted and can barely speak, suffering from a chronic illness. Even drinking water is difficult. Gandhi's wife remains by his side. Gandhi lies quietly on a small iron bed in the shade of a mango tree near the prison wall. After examining him, doctors stated that Gandhi should no longer exert himself in political discussions. Indian representatives and representatives of the untouchable class negotiated for ten hours, and as a result, an agreement was reached. They immediately obtained Gandhi's consent, and the representatives decided to immediately telegraph MacDonald, requesting that he halt the government's decision regarding the conditions for Indian Hindus.</p>
<p>▲ Poona, 20th Dispatch from Havas: The agreement reached by Gandhi, the untouchable class, and Hindu leaders stipulates that 148 seats in the provincial legislative councils should be reserved for untouchables (i.e., the lowest caste). The same percentage of seats should also be reserved for untouchables in the central legislative council elected by general election. These seats must be reserved during the primary elections. In addition, the agreement stipulates that this method will be effective for ten years, and that untouchables should have equal representation among Indian civil servants. In their telegram to MacDonald, Hindu and untouchable leaders stated that the original text of the agreement would be recorded separately and submitted to the Bombay Provincial Government, which would then forward it to the Indian Government and the British Prime Minister. The telegram continued, "Gandhi's health is increasingly in danger. Preventing accidents is not only in Gandhi's personal interest but also in the interest of the entire nation. Therefore, please immediately withdraw the resolution on separate electorates so that Gandhi can end his fast. Further delays will endanger Gandhi's life and will have an adverse impact on public opinion. India is waiting for your command. Decide quickly."</p>
<p>▲ Poona, 24th Dispatch from Reuters: If British Prime Minister MacDonald agrees to the request from representatives of both the caste Hindus and the lower castes to change the method of political participation of the lower castes proposed by the British government, then Gandhi's fast will have achieved its goal of abolishing separate electorates for the lower castes. However, Gandhi's achievement of this goal has sacrificed many seats for the caste Hindus. The agreement is a mutual concession. The movement to improve the lower castes by caste Hindus is becoming more and more exciting. Many temples have already been opened, and other conveniences are also being provided generously. Whether this enthusiasm will last is still a question. Lower-caste leaders are extremely satisfied with this agreement. Although caste Hindus are not as happy, they are relieved that Gandhi's life has been saved as a result.</p>
<h3>Son of Swedish Bricklayer Leaps to Become Prime Minister</h3>
<p>▲ Stockholm, 24th Dispatch from Guomin News Agency: Today, the King of Sweden approved the new Hansson cabinet and officially appointed the ministers. In addition to Hansson as Prime Minister, more important appointments include Sandler as Foreign Minister, Vennerström as Defense Minister, and Wigforss as Finance Minister. Hansson is the son of a bricklayer, 47 years old, and is currently the chairman of the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<p>▲ Stockholm, 24th Dispatch from Havas: The new program of the Socialist government focuses on alleviating the economic panic, advocating (1) lowering tariff barriers, (2) creating public works to accommodate unemployed workers, (3) establishing a long-term unemployment insurance system, and (4) gradually reorganizing the national defense forces and limiting armaments to the greatest extent possible. The declaration mentions the Kruge case, the late match king, and proclaims that the government will manage national wealth publicly. Finally, in order to protect the direct interests of the people, special laws will be adopted to protect international credit and international cooperation.</p>
<h3>German Election Campaigns Not Very Active</h3>
<p>Papen Hails Policy Success</p>
<p>Another New Party Rises Unexpectedly</p>
<p>Hitler's Party Not Easy to Recover</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, 24th Dispatch from Guomin News Agency: The German government announced that the general election for the Reichstag is over a week away, but the various political parties have not shown any signs of very active campaigning. The reason for this is probably half due to the fact that individuals or newspapers inciting public opinion against the current government and those engaging in terrorist acts will be severely punished, causing the extremists to dare not act recklessly. In addition, the Centre Party has religious beliefs binding its members, and the Social Democratic Party also has trade unions restricting its members. The discipline of both parties is extremely strict, and their strength is unlikely to undergo major changes. The German National People's Party, under the leadership of Hugenberg, actually has close relationships with the members of the Papen cabinet, and it is certain to gain more seats this time. Because Hitler stubbornly demanded dictatorial power and refused to cooperate with President Hindenburg and Prime Minister Papen, it is expected that many voters who voted for the National Socialist Party on July 31st will change their votes to the German National People's Party. However, a new party has unexpectedly risen, and the strength of the German National People's Party is likely to be greatly affected. When this party was first announced, no one paid attention to it, and many regarded it as a game. Now it is known that it was founded by two young journalists. One of them recently received a huge inheritance and decided to use it all to start a party, with the goal of eliminating economic and political corruption and opening up a bright future. Although people in the government claim to have nothing to do with the new party, it is rumored that many people who have long since left the political arena are calling for saving the motherland and joining the party, so its strength cannot be underestimated. However, according to the current situation, except for the decline of Hitler's party, there is unlikely to be a major change in the political situation. Papen's cabinet wants to obtain a majority in the new parliament, but its hopes are extremely slim.</p>
<h3>Egyptians Are Brave in Private Fights</h3>
<p>▲ Cairo, 24th Dispatch from Reuters: People in the two towns of Akhmim and Sohag, Egypt, today resumed mutual killings, resulting in 13 people drowned, 100 injured, and 50 detained. First, 3,000 people from Akhmim sailed into Sohag, and then a fierce fight broke out.</p>
<h3>The Jiji Aircraft Flying Across the Pacific Has Disappeared</h3>
<p>Possibly Due to Radio Problems</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 25th Dispatch from Reuters: The Jiji Shimbun airplane, piloted by Nikkan Kiyoshi and others, took off from Rinndai at 5:35 yesterday morning, intending to fly across the Pacific Ocean via the northern route. Since 11:00 last night, there has been no news of it, and radio stations have been unable to communicate with it. According to the latest telegram, the plane was flying over Iturup Island in the Kuril Islands. According to weather reports, there are storms on the route that the plane must take, so people are quite worried about the plane.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 25th Dispatch from Denryoku News Agency: The Third Jiji Nichibei has been advancing continuously since departing from Rinndai at 5:35 yesterday morning. At 10:06 a.m., the Otchiishi Radio Station received a telegram from the plane stating that it had passed 20 nautical miles from Horomushiro, the sky was clear, and the flight was pleasant. The only concern was the low pressure in the Bering Sea, and it would change direction to avoid the unaffected sky. The airframe and engine were all in good condition, and the crew were all in high spirits. After that, the radio sensitivity gradually weakened until it disappeared completely at 11:00. It is deeply feared that there is a radio failure on the plane, so the Otchiishi Radio Station is now entrusting all parties to report the news.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Test Plane Explodes Mid-Air</h3>
<p>Two Pilots Reduced to Ashes</p>
<p>▲ Budapest, 24th Dispatch from Reuters: Two pilots today tested a newly invented automobile in the countryside. The car was equipped with a propulsion engine in the rear. When encountering obstacles in front, it could rise and stay in the air. When the two were conducting the final test, it suddenly exploded, reducing them to ashes. The car was also wrecked.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Manila: Shenbao transfer to all national salvation organizations and military, political, commercial, academic, and other circles across the country. The violent Japanese have recognized the puppet organization, intending to swallow us whole. All our countrymen should rise up in resistance. The overseas Chinese in the Philippines are resisting most fiercely. Anti-Japanese national salvation associations of overseas Chinese in various provinces and ports are ubiquitous. The All-Philippines National Salvation Federation has been established as a central organization, with Zeng Tingquan elected as the chairman. Progress is smooth, and all overseas Chinese support it, vowing to perish together with the violent Japanese. It has now remitted through the American branch of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese National Salvation Economic Committee, Li Denghui and Xu Jigong, to assist the Northeast Volunteer Army, 6,685 Shanghai currency. All-Philippines Overseas Chinese National Salvation Federation respectfully bows.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Manchurian Problem and the Attitude of the Powers</h3>
<p>▲ The Japanese Also Know They Are Not Tolerated by the World</p>
<p>▲ Harboring Suspicions Toward the League of Nations and the United States</p>
<p>The Tokyo Jiji Shimpo recently published an article by Hikosuke Kamikawa entitled "The Impact of Recognizing Manchuria on the World," detailing the future attitudes of the powers toward Japan and the policies adopted by the League of Nations General Assembly in discussing the Sino-Japanese problem. Excerpts are translated below.</p>
<p>(Today, our country (referring to Japan) has officially recognized (Manchukuo). This can be marked as a period in the diplomatic history of the Far East and is a major historical event. However, after our country recognized Manchuria, how will the countries of the world and the General Assembly of the League react? And what attitude will the United States take in the future? To what extent will the situation in the Far East change? These are the most noteworthy issues in international diplomacy. (omitted) Considering that Japan's policy may not be tolerated by all parties, the League of Nations and other related parties will inevitably cause various major disturbances. First, in relation to the League, the report of the League's investigation team has not yet been published. The world recognizes the importance of the report in relation to the Manchurian issue. However, according to external reports, the conclusion of the report is greatly inconsistent with Japan's policy. The conclusion is that, on the one hand, Manchuria cannot be restored to its pre-incident state, and on the other hand, although it can be placed under Japanese protection, Japan is not allowed to annex Manchuria. Manchuria will belong to Chinese sovereignty and become an autonomous state. The League General Assembly in December will base its final judgment on the Manchurian incident based on this report. The first step of the General Assembly will be to invoke Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the League Covenant, and based on the conclusions of the report, issue a certain resolution. At the same time, this resolution will be communicated to China and Japan, advising the two countries to reconcile. However, Japan has already recognized (Manchukuo) and will not obey any mediation plan proposed by the League. At this point, the League will invoke Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant and proceed to discuss the second step, which is that the General Assembly will prepare (a report describing the facts of the dispute and providing fair and appropriate advice) and publish it to the world. In this process, Japan's actions will inevitably be criticized. However, during the League's judgment of Japan's actions, major struggles will inevitably occur between large and small countries. Because the League of Nations is built on the authority of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, all small countries seeking guarantees for their own interests, independence, and security will rely on their majority and the power of the United States to develop pure theories and attack Japan's actions. They will still follow the resolution of the League General Assembly on March 11th, and these small countries will rise up in response to the Hoover Doctrine, striving to establish the Hoover Doctrine as the fundamental principle of international politics, mutually denouncing Japan as an aggressor and declaring Japan's guilt. At this time, the advanced imperialist countries such as Britain, France, and Italy may tolerate Japan's actions and handle them as special exceptions, allowing them to evolve naturally. However, if the United States and the small countries strongly insist on using the report to invoke the Covenant to pressure Japan, then Japan and the League will have a major head-on collision. On the other hand, due to the mediation of Britain, France, and other countries, negotiations between the parties will be eased, allowing the General Assembly to reach a resolution. How the General Assembly will ultimately resolve the issue depends on the pressure exerted by the United States. Regarding the future attitude of the United States, a statement was issued on January 7th (any means that violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, regardless of treaties, agreements, or circumstances, will not be recognized). Therefore, the resolution of the League General Assembly on March 11th was based on Stimson's speech. In the future, the United States will certainly adhere to its original position, deny the establishment of (Manchukuo), and awaken world opinion to pressure Japan. Moreover, if the United States fails to achieve its goal by impeaching Japan in the League General Assembly, the United States will convene an international conference to resolve the Manchurian issue. In this way, not only will relations between China and Japan become more dangerous, but a great turbulence in the Pacific Ocean will evolve into an unimaginable situation.)</p>
<h3>Shandong War Immediately Ceases</h3>
<p>▲ Result of Meeting Between Jiang Bocheng and Han Fuju</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After arriving in Jinan yesterday morning (22nd), Jiang Bocheng immediately took a special train to Weixian with Provincial Government Committee Member Zhang Yue and Provincial Government Restructuring Committee Member Zhang Weicun. I also went with the train. We arrived at 7:00 this morning. The county magistrate and county party committee members were all at the station to welcome us. Liu Shuxiang, the chief of staff of the Third Route Army stationed in Weixian, immediately called Shahe to ask Han whether he would come to Weixian to meet with Jiang or request a car to welcome Jiang to Weixian. Jiang and others then departed from Weixian by car at 9:15 a.m. Liu Shuxiang and others saw them off at the station. Jiang, Zhang Weicun, and Zhang Yue rode in one car, and I rode with the other people in another car. The roads inside and outside Weixian City were muddy, and the car had to be pushed and pulled. After leaving Weixian, the road was still bad. The Yanwei Highway sent many people to repair the road along the way, cutting the grass beside the road to pave it. The Yanwei Road is as straight as an arrow, with Qin trees lining both sides, and the mountain grass is three or four feet high, like a wall. Traveling in it is like being in a painting, but the yellow leaves are fluttering, and the autumn insects are chirping, giving people endless autumn thoughts. Along the way, in addition to the endless stream of supply vehicles, the peasants were working in the fields as usual, with no signs of war. At 11:00, we passed Changi, and hundreds of people, including Wu Huawen, the commander of the Second Regiment of the Handgun Brigade, the magistrate of Changi County, and representatives from all walks of life, greeted us at the station with flags and music. Jiang and others did not get off the train. At 11:15, we arrived at the Wei River. The car crossed the river by boat. The original bridge on the highway had been burned by Liu Zhennian's troops when they retreated, and now only ashes remain. It is said that the bridge was worth more than 100,000 yuan, which is also a gift from the war. At 1:00 p.m., we arrived at Xinhe Town. When Han went to the front line to inspect, he had not yet returned. The headquarters was in a shop, and the arrangement was extremely simple, with only a few guards at the door. In Xinhe Town, merchants and residents were buying and selling as usual, as peaceful as ever. Han did not return until 3:00. After meeting, they exchanged greetings one by one. Han first explained the unavoidable difficulties of this action, and Jiang also stated the mission to Shandong, saying that the central government and Chairman Chiang and Minister He and Director Zhang (Xueliang) all hoped to first stop military action and then discuss a good solution. Han immediately said that this action was truly unavoidable and that he would absolutely obey the orders of the central government and Chairman Chiang. He would immediately cease military action on the spot and drafted a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, Chairman Chiang, Zhang Xueliang, and He Yingqin. The main idea of the telegram was that he had received the order of the Executive Yuan and would cease military action immediately and await the resolution of the central government. Beginning today, he would cease military action on the spot, and so on. Jiang and others praised Han for his forthright actions. Han also said to me that he had always acted without leaving the country or the people. This action was entirely for the sake of saving the people of eastern Shandong. Each county in eastern Shandong is an administrative region of the Shandong Provincial Government, not an independent zone. As the chairman of Shandong, I have a heavy responsibility and cannot ignore it. All the counties in the province are safe, but the counties in eastern Shandong are in deep water and are even more unbearable. Recently, regarding the so-called military expenditure issue, Liu insisted on 150,000. In fact, more than 150,000 could also be agreed upon. Because Director Li (Shuchun) and Committee Member Zhang (Weicun) mediated, hoping to reduce it somewhat, but Liu only agreed to reduce 1,000 or 800, which is a joke. Furthermore, during the war in 1919, Liu's army also planned to attack the rear of my Third Route Army. I had a motive for conquest because of these various reasons. Now that Chief Counselor Jiang (Bocheng) is here to convey the orders of the central government and Chairman Chiang, ordering me to cease military action, I can only obey and wait for a good solution. I asked about the solution. Han said that Liu's army must be transferred away before the problem can be solved. Jiang and Han talked for a long time. In the evening at 5:00, Jiang bid farewell and left Shahe by the original car with Zhang Weicun, Zhang Yue, and others. They returned to Weixian at 7:30. Jiang Bocheng was pleased with the successful outcome of this trip and reported the details to Beijing, Hankou, and Ping Report. It is heard that he will return to Jinan tonight or tomorrow morning. According to information obtained in Shahe, Liu Zhennian is indeed staying in the Ninth Middle School in Yexian City. Inside the city are Liu's First Brigade, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments, and the Third Brigade, the 7th, 8th, and 9th Regiments, for a total of six regiments. Yesterday morning, they launched an offensive out of the city, but were repelled by Han's army. Outside the city, there are trenches and fortifications in Gaigou. The people's food has been sealed and withheld in order to plan a desperate defense. Liu's training regiment is stationed in Qixia. It is heard that Liu's army in Longkou has now withdrawn and is being defended by the Marine Corps (23rd).</p>
<h3>He Long Scurries and Disturbs Baokang</h3>
<p>▲ He Chengjun Orders Liu's Division to Pursue and Suppress</p>
<p>▲ The Honghu Bandit Nest Has Been Declared Completely Cleared</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Long's remnant bandits, formerly due to their old nest in Honghu being blockaded by government troops, were reported to have fled, passing through Jiangling, Jingmen, Nanzhang, and reaching Baokang, attempting to flee north. He Chengjun, Commander of the Left Route Army, had previously personally gone to Tianmen to plan the pursuit and suppression. He has already ordered Liu Maoen's troops to intercept them head-on, while Xiao Zhichu and Fan Shisheng's two divisions are tasked with following in pursuit. Fan's division, originally stationed in Zhongxiang, has been ordered to proceed to Xiangfan, and the defense of Zhongxiang left behind will be taken over by troops dispatched by Xiao's division. When necessary, He will personally go to Xiangyang to command. The bandits led by He Long are the remnants of the pseudo Eighth and Ninth Divisions, numbering about three thousand. They have been repeatedly ambushed en route, suffering heavy losses. With the encirclement and suppression by the large army, it should not be difficult to eliminate them completely. After He completed the arrangements, he returned to Hankou by plane on the 24th. According to his conversation, it should not be difficult to wipe out the remnant bandits in one fell swoop. As for the remnant bandits in Honghu, they have largely been declared completely suppressed. Currently, Zhang Zhenhan, Liu Peixu, Xu Jiwu, and other units are searching for scattered bandits. Xu Yuanquan, the Deputy Commander supervising the suppression in Xindi, believes that the bandit nest there has been completely destroyed, and the remaining small fry can definitely be completely eliminated before the scheduled date of the 25th. He has specifically scheduled to return to Hankou from Xindi with Zhu Huaibing, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, by boat on the 25th. As for the Central Route Army, after capturing Jinjiazhai, the remnant bandits dispersed and hid in the Nanxi, Banzhuyuan, Wangjiawan, Zhaojiahe, Huangnihao, Laomaodong, and Lijiaji areas southwest of Jinjiazhai, hoping to prolong their lives. After searching and suppressing by various armies, Nanxi and Lijiaji were occupied one after another on the 22nd. Zhang Fang's troops searched and suppressed scattered bandits northeast of Jinjiazhai, and on the 22nd, they divided their troops and advanced towards Zaozhuehe, Goujiling, and Qianjin, and immediately recovered those places, capturing and killing many bandits. They also rescued more than three thousand refugees in Zaozhuehe. At the same time, a small number of remnant bandits also fled and hid in Tengjiabao, Muzhihe north of Luotian, and Qin Yuhong and other places in Huang'an. Zhang Yinxiang's 30th Army and Wan Yaohuang's 13th Division divided their forces and encircled and suppressed them. Zhang's troops have successively recovered Muzhihe and Tengjiabao. The headquarters of the 31st Division has advanced into Muzidian, and Wan's division has also completely disarmed hundreds of Red Guards in Qin Yuhong. Eastern Hubei, Southern Henan, and Western Anhui have largely returned to peace. However, in places where the Red Bandits have entrenched themselves for a long time, the people are in deep distress. Liu Zhi, Chairman of Henan, telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to request disaster relief. Chiang Kai-shek has replied by telegram, promising to do his best. Recently, Zhang Fang, Commander-in-Chief of the 20th Route Army, supervised the army in Shangcheng and personally visited the disaster area. Witnessing the misery of the refugees, he was deeply saddened. He telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek and Liu Zhi from Shangcheng on the 24th, requesting them to allocate a large amount of grain and funds and send personnel to the disaster area for disaster relief. The telegram reads: Commanders Chiang Kai-shek and Deputy Commander Liu Jun of the Hankou Headquarters, Fang has supervised the army to Shangcheng, searching for roads through the grass and repairing bridges and rivers along the way. The villages and towns encountered are all scorched earth. There is no sound of chickens or dogs for hundreds of miles. Near Shangcheng, corpses are everywhere. Many of the people are sick and hungry, gasping for breath, crawling in the grass, having escaped from the bandits' fetters, not having eaten for several days, the sounds of crying and groaning intermingling. Unable to walk, they sit and lie down waiting to die, which is extremely pitiful. The harm done by the bandits has reached this extreme. In addition to feeling compassion, Fang is eager to provide relief. However, due to the lack of grain and rice during the journey, he can only help send people to the rear. Recently, the various units at the front line have been intercepting civilians who have been forced to join Liu's army, numbering thousands upon thousands, with few able-bodied men and many women. They are being escorted to Shangcheng in an endless stream. According to reports, when the Second and Sixth Columns occupied Tangjiahui, about 60,000 civilians fled north. Furthermore, according to a report from Brigade Commander Fan, tens of thousands of civilians are seeking help from the army. He has ordered Xilai to [do something], etc. Fang is trying to provide one meal a day for those who have arrived, but it is already difficult to sustain. Although he has ordered officials from Hanguang and other counties to bring cooked food and provide relief in their respective counties, it is like a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. Moreover, the counties have been devastated by the bandits, and the people have been coerced by them, leaving fields barren and houses burned. There are villages without houses and families without food. It is not easy to settle them now, and it will be even more difficult to sustain them in the future. He intends to earnestly request Your Excellencies to quickly allocate a large amount of grain and funds and send personnel to provide relief to save the people from the disaster. The merit will be immeasurable. Fang's duty is military affairs, and he should not be involved in civil affairs. However, having witnessed the tragic situation, he cannot bear to remain silent and must speak out. Moreover, Fang has spent half his life in the military, suppressing bandits many times, and has never seen such a tragic situation. The beautiful land is filled with weeping. Bullets fly across dangerous and dense forests. To learn from the past and avoid future mistakes, we should start by dispelling heresy, rectifying people's hearts, promoting morality, and reforming politics. We should order prominent figures from the three provinces to bring young students from schools to visit the military districts in batches, conduct on-the-spot investigations of the people's suffering, prove the Communists' lies, and use the people's accounts of the events to let people know that the Red Bandits are more cruel than Chuang and Xian. In this way, the blood of the dead can save the minds of young people, and the world and people's hearts can be transformed. Corrupt officials and wealthy people can take this as a warning, donate their extravagant expenses, and jointly save the dying people. Millions of lives can be saved. Good policies and laws should be implemented without any flaws, which may be of some help. Fang is personally experiencing this, his heart is torn apart, and the misery of the refugees is as if he were experiencing it himself. He sincerely reports this to you, hoping for your benevolent assistance. The telegram is urgent, and it is difficult to express the full extent of his grief. He respectfully hopes for your consideration and is filled with anticipation. Zhang Fang kowtows. (September 24th)</p>
<h3>The Process of Wang Jun's Troops Capturing Various Bandit Nests in Western Anhui</h3>
<p>▲ Kuang, the Bandit Leader, Killed in the Battle of Guojiadian</p>
<p>▲ Wang's Army Directly Approaches the Bandit Nest in Jinjiazhai</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The armies of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui are launching a large-scale suppression of bandits and have now recovered Jinjiazhai, the old nest of the Red Bandits on the border of Western Anhui. The bandits' base has completely disappeared. Recently, Weng Shuhe, a staff officer of the Third Army, returned to Xuzhou from the front lines. According to him, the situation of the bandit suppression in Western Anhui is as follows: (The bandit suppression army in Western Anhui, with Wang Jun as the Commander-in-Chief, led the Seventh and Twelfth Divisions of the Third Army as the main force. Initially, they penetrated deep into the interior and suffered some losses. Later, after reorganizing their troops in Liu'an and resting for two months, they received orders from Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek to reorganize the Western Anhui front. Xu Tingyao's troops were assigned to the right-wing column, Liang Guanying's troops were assigned to the left-wing column, and Wang Jun's troops were assigned to the central column. Wang's troops built a pontoon bridge on August 10th to cross the Pihe River and arrived at [Blank]jiabu. This area was originally a prosperous area, but after being ravaged by the Red Bandits, it is now desolate and uninhabited. Broken tiles and collapsed walls are covered in weeds. Stagnant water has become toxic. Anyone who drinks it dies immediately. Wang Jun immediately ordered the Seventh Division to attack Huoxingmiao, while the Twelfth Division crossed the river from Kongjiaying to occupy Qianjiaji. Kuang Jidong, the pseudo Commander-in-Chief of the Red Bandits' Eastern Expeditionary Army, heard the news and led three divisions of bandits to attack Qianjiaji, intending to launch a fierce attack on the Twelfth Division. At this time, the Seventh Division had already advanced from Huoxingmiao to occupy Guojiadian to support the Twelfth Division. Kuang then changed his strategy and personally led the entire army to launch a fierce attack on Guojiadian. The troops of the Seventh Division in Guojiadian, only the Thirty-seventh and Thirty-eighth Regiments of the Nineteenth Brigade, had not yet completed their deployment and immediately made contact with the bandits. The bandits did not fire a single shot at first. At noon on the 16th, they suddenly broke into our army's lines, shouting and killing. The two armies engaged in close combat, completely hand-to-hand. In the evening, the bandits increased their reinforcements and launched a decisive battle. Our army, in addition to fighting back with broadswords and bayonets, also used machine guns and mortars to bombard them. The bandits began to falter and retreated in the dark. It is estimated that our army killed more than two thousand bandits. Kuang was injured in this battle and died shortly after being carried to Xujiaji. Our army suffered five to six hundred casualties. Gao Qikun, the commander of the Thirty-eighth Regiment, was injured, and Gui Huafeng, the deputy commander of the regiment, was killed in action. This battle was the first major battle in the bandit suppression in Anhui Province. After the Red Bandits were defeated, they fled in two directions, one retreating to Dingjiaji and the other retreating to Huoxingmiao. Our army took advantage of the victory to continue its advance. After Kuang's death, Cai Shenxi took over as the pseudo commander-in-chief. They retreated from Xuji to Yangliudian. Our army followed and reoccupied Yangliudian. The bandits retreated again to Dongyuemiao. After a short rest, on the 27th, the Seventh Division launched another fierce attack. The bandits, already in a state of collapse, were easily defeated. The Seventh Division occupied Dongyuemiao, and the bandits retreated to Kangjiapu. This place is the gateway to Dushan and Mabao, and the bandits were unwilling to abandon it again. On the 29th, the Seventh Division launched another fierce attack on Zhongkangjiapu. At 11:00 AM, they made contact with the bandits. In a short time, the bandits were already faltering, and our army immediately broke in. While they were arranging their positions and cutting down trees, the Red Bandits launched a counterattack from Dushan and Mabao. Our army was caught off guard and suffered heavy casualties. Fortunately, Li Shilong, the commander of the Nineteenth Brigade, supervised the officers and soldiers to defend to the death and calmly fought back, and finally repelled the Red Bandits. At this time, Wang Jun had already advanced to Nanyuemiao to supervise the army and urgently ordered the Twelfth Division to occupy Shipodian to support our Kangjiapu line.</p>
<p>Seeing that they could not shake our forces, the bandits retreated back to their old nest in Dushan and Mabao. Wang Jun again ordered Li Wenbin, the commander of the Twenty-first Brigade, to lead his troops from Nanyuemiao to attack Dushan, with the Ninth Brigade assisting. The Twelfth Division also threatened from Shipodian, and another battle was fought with the bandits. Finally, on the 5th of this month, Dushan was captured. Five to six hundred Red Bandits were killed in action, and they completely retreated to Mabao. It was discovered that Mabao had two large mountains, extremely dangerous, called the East and West Incense Ridge. The Nineteenth and Twenty-first Brigades launched an offensive on the 7th at dawn. The Nineteenth Brigade attacked the West Incense Ridge from Shipodian, and the Twenty-first Brigade attacked the East Incense Ridge from Dushan. This battle was a critical moment for the survival of the Red Bandits, and the fighting was extremely fierce. From the morning of the 7th to the evening of the 9th, our army finally captured the East and West Ridges. At the same time, it was discovered that the Red Bandits were attempting to cut off our rear. Wang Jun immediately ordered the Twelfth Division to intercept them, advancing from Shipodian. On the 9th, they engaged the bandits in battle at Qipan Mountain. The Seventh Division also drew elite troops to encircle and attack from the mountains. The remnant bandits were attacked from both sides and completely collapsed. All of the tens of thousands of Red Bandits in Western Anhui at this time were reduced to only two thousand fleeing towards their old nest in Jinjiazhai in a state of disarray. This battle was the final major battle before the recovery of Jinjiazhai. At the same time, Wang Jun telegraphed Xu Tingyao's division stationed in Yejiaji to intercept them. Xu's division intercepted the remnant bandits in the area of Daxiaomadian and seized hundreds of rifles. Liang Guanying's troops also made detours to block and search for the remaining bandits. When the various armies advanced to Daxiaomadian, they received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, ordering them to temporarily halt their advance to wait for the armies of Eastern Hubei and Southern Henan to arrive at suitable locations and coordinate with each other. Therefore, Wang's troops rested briefly in Daxiaomadian. On the 20th, they received orders to advance again and joined forces with friendly armies to capture Jinjiazhai. This place was the location of the Soviet government of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and all of the bandits' military treasures were stored there, which were immediately captured. At this point, the bandit suppression was declared complete. It was discovered that the Red Bandits' strategy was initially to lure the enemy, then to attack whenever it rained, and third, to launch sudden attacks when the army arrived and did not have time to deploy. In addition to the Children's Army, the Red Guards, and the Independent Regiment, there was also a Grain-Grabbing Team, which specialized in robbing food. All of the women in the bandit areas were organized into groups to wash clothes, comfort, and promote propaganda. The expenses for one regiment were only 863 yuan, and the office expenses for the regimental headquarters were only 3 yuan. Land was divided for planting to win over the bandit army and poor peasants. In the Red areas, the people had a deep impression of communism and still need to be corrected over a period of time. The bandits also printed Soviet government banknotes, which circulated in the bandit areas. (September 24th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>▲ Escaped Murderer to Be Escorted by Police: The case of Zhang Dongfu's family of Xiuye Bridge East Bank in the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), where three people were murdered, only resulted in the arrest of accomplice Shen Aqin at the time. After interrogation, it was determined that the mastermind was Li Xingtings surnamed Xiaotaibao. After the incident, he escaped without a trace. Rewards were offered for his arrest, but he was never caught. Last month, Xiaotaibao sneaked back to Shanghai. Because his friends repeatedly borrowed money, he became angry and lured them to the Great World, taking the opportunity to stab them with a knife and escape. Later, the injured person was taken to the hospital for treatment and reported the address of the assailant. After investigation, Xiaotaibao was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court for trial and sentencing. The prosecutor's office of the Songjiang County Court heard about this and, because the suspect had committed a crime in Songjiang that had not been resolved, urgently needed to be brought to justice. Therefore, they prepared a document and dispatched police chief Wu Xuexian to Shanghai today (the 26th) to escort him back for trial.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲ Robbery of a Barge at Yacheng Bridge: Yacheng Bridge in Dongxiang is an important waterway between Changshu and Wuxi, with many ships passing through every day. However, after nightfall, no one dares to sail for fear of accidents. Unexpectedly, the area has become even more dangerous recently, with pirate ships blocking and robbing passing ships. The other day, Tu Yaoyuan, a native of Changshu, carrying 400 yuan in foreign currency, hired a barge from Yu to Xi, intending to buy rice in Luoyang. As evening approached, the boat reached Yacheng Bridge. Fearing the dangers of traveling at night, they moored to the west of the bridge. At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, a pirate ship suddenly approached the boat. Taking advantage of Tu and the others snoring, they cut the rope and slowly pushed the boat westward, blocking it in a desolate area. The pirates jumped on board and searched. In the ashes of the stove, they found 250 yuan in silver dollars and 100 yuan in foreign currency, then quietly sailed away. When Tu and the others woke up and saw the boat moored in the middle of the river, they realized what had happened. They quickly checked their silver dollars and found that they were gone.</p>
<p>▲ Water Police Chief Encircles and Suppresses Lake Bandits: Shen Gaoqing, the chief of the second and third districts of the Waterborne Public Security Bureau, believes that the lake areas have been rampant in recent months, with frequent robberies. A few days ago, a large gang of lake bandits robbed the town of Zhangjiaqiao on the border of Xi and Yu. After the robbery, they fled into Yangcheng Lake. Although he strictly ordered his subordinates to suppress them, the bandits' strength has not diminished. Recently, according to reports, a large group of lake bandits is hiding on Tiantai Mountain in Taihu Lake, plotting wrongdoing. Chief Shen Xun has learned about this.</p>
<p>On the day before yesterday, he came to Xi from Su to inspect the officers and soldiers of the various detachments. He also ordered Shi Yunlian, the chief of the Sixth Brigade, to immediately gather all of the brigade's ships and the Baosu and Zhaowu warships and concentrate them at Daxuankou in order to encircle and suppress the lake bandits. After receiving the order, Chief Shi immediately gathered his troops and sailed to Daxuankou overnight to await orders. After issuing the order, Chief Shen also rushed to Yixing to inspect the Ninth Brigade and scheduled to return to Xi today (the 25th) to personally lead the troops to Tiantai Mountain in Taihu Lake to encircle and suppress the bandits, hoping to wipe them out in one fell swoop.</p>

After entering, they immediately seized training officer Wu Guangxing and shot him dead. All of the corps headquarters' guns and documents were looted. The next night, the bandits went to the nearby Mujiazhuang and kidnapped Chen Changyi, the former patrol officer of the water patrol team, and Guo Wenlin, the platoon leader of the defense corps. They took them to the Sanlangmiao Defense Corps and also took Guo Wulin, the training officer of the corps, to Hengjinghe and shot him dead. They also robbed the corps of three Mauser pistols, one Ma Guai rifle, two Hook rifles, one 套桶 (tàotǒng) rifle, and two five-zi steel rifles. Also, farmers Liu Chuanzhi and Guo Zhengting from Nan Hanzhuang, who were staying at Sanlangmiao that night, were also shot and wounded by the bandits.

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Construction of Warehouses and Platforms on the Hangjiang Railway: The Hangjiang Railway's freight transport is increasing daily. Due to the limited number of freight cars, there are often accumulations at various stations. Allowing the goods to be scattered would make them difficult to care for, greatly affecting operations. It has been decided to build a freight warehouse each at Jiangbian, Suxi, Yiwu, Yiting, Jinhua, and Lanxi stations, and two warehouses at Linpu Station, each 20 feet wide and 84 feet long. One warehouse each will be built at Sushan, Anhua, Zhengwu, and Xiaoshun stations, each 24 feet wide and 60 feet long. All will use wooden frames and corrugated iron for the walls and tiled roofs to maintain freight transport. In addition, a 60-meter-long freight platform will be built at each station to facilitate loading and unloading. The design of this project has been completed, requiring a total of 58,775 yuan and 6 jiao. The project was submitted to the Construction Department for approval, and the approved budget was reduced to 54,753 yuan. Bids will be solicited for contractors. Furthermore, the railway will purchase 40 additional freight cars. The Construction Department has telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to forward the old case to the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Jianghai Customs to allow the import tax to be recorded on account. These vehicles are expected to be shipped to Hang in batches in October and November.</p>

<p>▲ Civilian Boat Sinks on the Haoba River: Cui Rendai Xing from Dujiang Bridge Village in Duxi purchased tobacco leaves in Sheng County on the 16th of this month and hired Shen Agou's civilian boat from Sheng on the 21st to go to Baiguan, intending to transfer to Yong by car from Baiguan. Unexpectedly, the boat began to leak that night when it reached the Haoba River, about ten miles from Baiku, and soon sank. All fifteen passengers on board were submerged. Fortunately, another boat passed by and made every effort to rescue them, saving only eleven people. Four of them were from Sheng and were swept away by the waves. Cui and the other three from Yong have returned to Yong from Baiguan yesterday.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Zhang Huichang, Fu Bingchang, and Others Arrive Together</p>
<p>▲ Sun Denies Returning as Premier of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Says He Will Not Enter Beijing for the Time Being and Will Not Go North</p>
<p>Sun Ke and his wife, along with Zhang Huichang, Fu Bingchang, Chen Junpu, Wu Shangying, and others, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:00 AM aboard the Empress of Canada from Hong Kong. Sun denied the rumor that he would return as Premier of the Executive Yuan, saying that he would be resting in Shanghai and would not enter Beijing or go north for the time being. He did not wish to express any opinions on domestic affairs. The details of Sun's arrival in Shanghai and his remarks are described below:</p>
<p>▲ Welcoming Personnel: The Changxing Company's Empress of Canada, on which Sun and his party were traveling, arrived at Wusong at 6:30 AM yesterday. Due to tidal conditions, it was anchored off the coast of Songkou and did not enter the port. Therefore, the company's ferry, which was docked at the Xinguang Wharf, set off at 5:00 AM yesterday to pick up passengers in Song. Yang Hu, Chen Jianru, Liang Hancao, Ma Chaojun, Liu Weizhi, and representatives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau all boarded the ferry and went directly to Songkou to welcome them. Others, such as Sun's relatives and friends Zheng Hongnian, Chen Bingqian, Luo Panhui, and Chen Xinghan, totaling more than twenty people, waited at the Xinguang Wharf. The ferry arrived at Songkou at around 7:00 AM. Due to the late arrival of the quarantine doctor, there was a long wait. It was not until about 8:00 AM that they were able to board the large ship and meet Sun and his party. They then took the original ferry back to the Xinguang Wharf at 10:15 AM. After Sun and his wife landed, they went directly to their private residence on Molier Road to rest.</p>
<p>▲ Sun's Remarks: Sun received reporters from various newspapers at his residence on Molier Road yesterday afternoon. According to him, he recently met Mr. Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong. Mr. Hu has recovered from his illness and is currently staying in Hong Kong and has no intention of coming north. He had not heard of rumors that Guangdong was planning to convene the Third Plenary Session. This was unlikely to happen. He had come to Shanghai this time because his wife had recently recovered from illness, so he had accompanied her to Shanghai to rest and recuperate. The rumors that he would return as Premier of the Executive Yuan were inaccurate. He would not be entering Beijing or going north for the time being.</p>

<p>▲ International Situation Mr. Sun also discussed the changes in the international situation and diplomatic issues, stating that he recently learned from the newspapers that France is about to change its Far Eastern policy. This is indeed a major change in the international situation, which is beneficial to our country. Because Germany recently put forward the demand for equality in armaments with a strong attitude, and threatened not to attend the disarmament conference, France, for its own interests, had to actively unite with Britain to put pressure on Germany, and did not hesitate to change its Far Eastern policy as a bargaining chip. If so, Japan will inevitably be isolated in the international community. The reason why Japan dared to despise the League of Nations and act arrogantly in the past was entirely because France was its backing. If France changes its pro-Japanese Far Eastern policy, the power of the League of Nations will be greatly strengthened and can effectively suppress Japan, giving our country a great turning point in diplomacy. If our country can use its diplomatic policies at this time to unite with Britain and the United States in the maritime field and with Soviet Russia in the continental field, Japan will have no way to use its tricks. However, our country must have internal solutions; otherwise, relying solely on others will make it difficult to win the final victory.</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Zhang Huichang's Talk Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Mr. Zhang Huichang on the rounds. Zhang said that this trip to Shanghai was entirely a private affair. Zhang expressed great regret about the poor domestic political situation, saying that during this time of national crisis, some people are still keen on private feuds, which not only makes the whole world ridicule us, but also disappoints overseas Chinese. Zhang cited the overseas Chinese donating money to save the country during the Songhu War as evidence, saying that overseas Chinese previously believed that the failure of the Shanghai war was due to a lack of air force, so they launched a donation drive to raise money for aircraft to save the country. Each overseas Chinese had to pay a considerable amount of money, totaling more than five million. At that time, the Aviation Administration also sent personnel to negotiate. The matter was about to succeed, but the Guangdong War suddenly broke out, and the patriotic heart of the overseas Chinese vanished. This matter has been delayed invisibly to this day, but they have expressed that once the motherland has a war with foreign countries, they can still continue this great undertaking. The patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Wu and Chen Inspected the War Site in Zhabei Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ And Visited Sun Ke Together</p>
<p>Central Committee members Wu Chaochu and Chen Ce took a car to Zhabei, Wusong and other places yesterday morning at 10:00 to inspect the remains of the Shanghai War and returned in the evening to meet and talk with Sun Ke at his new residence.</p>
<h3>The Jiangnan Seawall Works Association Invited People from All Walks of Life to Survey the Baoshan Section Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan seawall works, such as the Dongtang Section, Baoshan Section, and Taichang Section, have been completed successively. The Seawall Works Committee specially invited people from all walks of life the day before yesterday to visit the Dongtang. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The association yesterday also invited people from all walks of life to inspect the Baoshan Section. They departed from the Baoshanmen Seawall Works Bureau at 9:00 am and returned at 1:00 pm. More than 60 people participated. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Participants After 8:00 am yesterday, participants from all parties arrived one after another. Those present included Mu Ouchu, vice chairman of the Jiangnan Seawall Works Committee; committee members Jin Houcheng, Tang Chengzong, Xu Guansan, and Pan Mingding; Zhuang Sihou of the Provincial Government Construction Department; Sun Xiwu, the magistrate of Baoshan County; Ling Zhibin, the section chief of the county construction bureau; Gao Xitian, the section chief of the county public security bureau; Yuan Bingyi and Tao Yunming of the Seawall Protection Committee; Zhou Jintang of the county party headquarters; and Bao Tigan, Bao Shou Xian, and Gu Zhenyi, gentlemen of the county; as well as representatives from all walks of life and two or three reporters from various newspapers and news agencies. At 9:00 am, Wan Kaijia, the director of the Baoshan Section Works Office, led the participants to inspect the Baoshan Section, passing through Chenhua Beach, then Lion Forest, then Xuejia Beach, Niutoujing, Shidong Beiwang Temple, Wuyuedun, Dachuansha and other seawall works, and returned at 1:00 pm. The Seawall Works Bureau entertained the visitors with a fine banquet, and then everyone dispersed in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲ Brief Description of the Project The Baoshan Section seawall works are divided into post-disaster reconstruction projects and military projects. The post-disaster reconstruction projects are divided into two sections: Section 1 (1) Chenhua Beach is 122 English lengths long, with two-pile and two-stone engineering; (2) Lion Forest is 126 English lengths long, with the same engineering as above; and another 315 lengths are pile-row engineering. Section 2 (1) Xuejia Beach is 336 English lengths long, with a weir dam, which is a two-pile and two-stone project; (2) Niutoujing is 84 English lengths long, with the same engineering as above. Section 1 (1) Wuyuedun is 145 English lengths long, with the same engineering as above; (2) Shidong Beiwang Temple is 335.8 English lengths long; (3) Shidong is 5 English lengths long. These two places were slightly repaired based on the original project. Regarding the military post-reconstruction projects, the first group from Wu Mu Feng to Chenhua Beach, filled trenches, repaired the seawall surface, repaired the stone seawall, and threw rubble, a total length of 807 English lengths; the second group, Gu Longdun, buried trenches and repaired the seawall surface, a length of 586.7 English lengths; the third group, Lion Forest, built the northern end revetment, filled bomb craters, and threw rubble, a total length of 167.7 English lengths; the fourth group, Zhangjiazhai and Xuejia Beach, repaired the seawall surface, cleaned up the seawall, and filled trenches, a total length of 297.7 English feet; the fifth group, Shidong, Shidong Beiwang Temple, Wuyuedun to Dachuansha, filled trenches, repaired the seawall surface, and cleaned up the cement wall, a total length of more than a thousand English lengths. In total, the post-disaster reconstruction project is 1095.3 English lengths long, and the military post-reconstruction project is 4549.9 English lengths long, costing 260,000, of which the reconstruction project only accounts for 50,000.</p>
<p>▲ Mu Ouchu Discusses Seawall Works Mu Ouchu, the vice chairman of the Seawall Works Committee, gave a speech to the reporter of the New Sound Agency yesterday, saying that the fundamental solution for the entire seawall works requires 20 million, and the symptomatic solution requires 3 million. This time, we received 400,000 from the provincial government, 250,000 from the municipal government, 150,000 from the Railway Department, and 10,000 from the flood disaster donation, for a total of 810,000. The seawall works built are only the most important part of the symptomatic treatment. The other secondary places on the seawall discovered this year are allowed to be dilapidated due to limited funds, which is extremely dangerous. However, the projects currently under construction are very solid and should be unimpeded. What is worrying is that the old projects outside of the construction, I hope that all sectors of society will pay attention to this and make them built in sequence, so that the coastal residents can rest easy again.</p>
<h3>Yan Fenglou and Others in Baoyi Telegraph to Request Continued Urgent Repair of Seawall Works</h3>
<p>The Huiyuan Township Public Office of the Fifth District of Baoshan County telegraphed to the Provincial Government, saying: Chairman Gu Junjian of the Provincial Government, the Baoyi seawall is in imminent danger. Last autumn, the Seawall Protection Committee of this county telegraphed Junfu, requesting the allocation of funds for emergency repairs on file. After the signing of the ceasefire agreement in Songhu this time, Junfu ordered the Jiangnan Seawall Post-Disaster Reconstruction Committee to select a commissioner to estimate the project and complete the 150-length dangerous work of Wuyuedun within a time limit. Junfu's blessing to the locality is not insignificant. However, what is worrying is that the 125-length project at the north end of the Yanchi in Beishidong is in a more critical state than the dangerous work of Wuyuedun. Moreover, this place is connected to Beishidong and is located at an important location with rapid water flow. If it is not rushed to be done, the consequences will be unimaginable once it collapses. Fenglou and others are nearby and have witnessed this situation, and are extremely frightened. Therefore, they urgently telegraphed Junfu, asking him to consider the precariousness of the fields and people's lives, and immediately send personnel to survey and estimate the project, and quickly allocate funds for construction. This would be a living Buddha for ten thousand families, offering incense and prayers in order to seek it. As the telegram comes to an end, the anticipation is overwhelming. Yan Fenglou, the head of Huiyuan Township in the Fifth District of Baoshan County, the deputy head Li Fengming, and all the villagers of the township, kowtow.</p>
<h3>Chambers of Commerce in Various Places Telegraph to Join the League of Nations Covenant Support Association</h3>
<p>After the League of Nations Covenant Support Association was initiated by more than 70 trade associations in this city, it is actively proceeding. Currently, more and more people are joining, and there are already more than 130 trade associations in this city, and more than 10 groups from other places, such as the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, have joined. Yesterday, the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed to join. It is heard that the association is actively preparing to organize task forces in various industries in order to implement an economic blockade against Japan. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>▲ Implementation Plan The association's plan to implement an economic blockade against Japan was drafted by Mr. Ren Jinping, who was appointed by the first design committee meeting. The implementation outline is now nearing completion, and the second design committee will be convened soon. However, this matter is of great importance, and discussion should be as detailed as possible. The design committee members are all famous figures and scholars from all walks of life, so the details will be studied and decided by the design committee in groups.</p>
<p>▲ Organizing Task Forces According to the association's charter, all member organizations should have a task force organization. The task force is the one that implements the economic blockade. The organizational rules for the task force of each industry association were drafted by Secretary-General Yan Esheng, who was appointed by the association's last standing committee. It has been drafted and will be sent to member organizations this week to actively organize.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram from Hankou The Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed yesterday to join the attack. The original telegram reads: To the League of Nations Covenant Support Committee in Shanghai, Junjian, the Jiang telegram has been read. Since the end of the European War, the losers have been ashamed of losing power and humiliating the country, and even the victorious countries have felt that they have gained more than they have lost. This is why the League of Nations Covenant was agreed upon. To ensure permanent world peace, we must rely on this as sacred and jointly abide by it, and its effect will be magnified. However, our strong neighbor Japan has always blindly believed that militarism is omnipotent, and does not hesitate to use its force to destroy the integrity of our Chinese territory and sovereignty, treating the covenant as waste paper, acting blindly against humanity. The world is in turmoil, and the crisis is looming. The world is terrified, and human desires are rampant. Considering that the people of our country are suffering deeply, in order to fight for the personality of the country and for world peace, we can only support the League of Nations Covenant and vow to resist the country that betrays faith for a long time, preferring to be broken jade than surviving as a tile. We have no hesitation in defending ourselves and saving the country. Your association's gentlemen are in awe of this great righteousness, and they have come forward to meet the difficulties. The whole country follows the wind. Our association does not hesitate to follow, and is willing to join the organization and work together to turn the tide. We hope to wipe out the old shame and new hatred in one fell swoop. In addition to copying the telegram, we sent it to the industry associations in this city, asking them to join in unison, and specially telegraphed to reply, hoping to be considered fortunate.</p>

<p>Xiong Xiling, etc., yesterday suggested to the government that it strictly prohibit exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, advance collection of grain, and protect the people's freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication. The original telegram stated: "The country is established by the people, and the people are the foundation of the nation. When the foundation is solid, the country is stable. This is an unchangeable saying for those who plan for the country from ancient times to the present. There is no way that the country can be governed if the people are not at peace. Today, the way to pacify the people is to reduce taxes and levies to greatly benefit the people's livelihood, and to promote civil rights to stabilize people's hearts. This is what this association wanted to suggest to the government at the beginning of its establishment, that is, to strictly prohibit the inferior policies of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies and advance collection of grain, and to protect the people's freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication. In recent years, natural disasters have occurred frequently, wars have continued, all industries have declined, and the countryside has gone bankrupt. Alas, our people are in deep water and are suffering from exploitation. For example, the special business tax in Jiangsu, the special goods tax in Anhui, the production and sales tax in Jiangxi, the donations for the aftermath of bandits, as well as the secret donations and lazy donations in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, are particularly prominent. All of these are cleverly established names, nothing more than exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. Sometimes, due to people's resistance, they are abolished and then revived, causing harm to the government. It is difficult to completely eliminate corruption. When examining their reasons, they all claim that military expenditures are huge and treasury expenditures are insufficient. In fact, reducing the customs duty and increasing taxes is indeed a way to make up for the deficit. Even if there is a large discrepancy between the budget and the expenditure, the responsibility lies with the Minister of Agriculture. The provinces should not be allowed to act on their own, causing chaos in the laws and regulations. Moreover, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies only enrich the pockets of officials. How much can actually benefit the national treasury? The advance collection of grain and various surcharges is even more harmful to the people. The government should plan as a whole, balance surpluses and deficits, make finances transparent, and not allow imbalances. Then, strict prohibitions should be issued so that no province can freely collect any taxes. This is the first point. The freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication is enshrined in the provisional constitution, and the First Plenary Session of the Fourth National Congress also made a firm resolution to protect it. However, local party and government authorities are blocking speech, suppressing postal and telecommunications, which is worse than the era of warlord politics. Restrictions on assembly and association are even more severe. Even national salvation groups like this association have been accused of being reactionary and have been interfered with. Others can be imagined. At a time when foreign aggression is severely oppressing us, and the whole country is fighting together, how should we cooperate sincerely and support each other? Now, even these most basic rights of the people, such as the freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication, are still being withheld, and even reactionary labels are being attached to incriminate them, disregarding the law and breaking faith. Not only will this fail to demonstrate fairness to the world, but it will also fail to inspire patriotic people to work together to overcome the national crisis. The government should respect the provisional constitution, implement the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session, and issue an order to the whole country to effectively protect the people's freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication. This is the second point. All of the above is intended to greatly benefit the people's livelihood and stabilize people's hearts. We hereby report it by telegram, hoping that you will consider it and implement it. Respectfully, Xiong Xiling, Chu Fucheng, Li Cishan, Liu Shixiong, Wang Bosha, Niu Chuanshan, Chen Dingyuan, Wang Yiping, Ni Guanghe, Standing Directors of the United Federation of National Salvation Groups of the Republic of China."</p>

<p>Chinese Boai Association and other fourteen groups telegraphed the National Government yesterday, saying, Nanjing National Government Junjian, after the brutal Japan and the puppet state signed the so-called protocol, all our people were heartbroken and angered, wanting to destroy the enemy even before meals. The volunteer army outside the pass, with hand-to-hand combat and charges, shocked the mountains and rivers. Although the Japanese bandits were fierce, they were exhausted from running around. It is a pity that this only remaining success in the anti-Japanese war, which has won glory for the nation, will be exhausted of ammunition and reinforcements and will disappear with the green gauze tent. Our government only makes futile written protests, without seeing a single soldier or pawn fighting the enemy. If we continue to delay and make mistakes, the consequences will be unimaginable. Even yellow-haired children know that this misfortune cannot be resolved without force. Now, we once again ask you to quickly determine the great plan of anti-Japanese resistance, send troops out of the pass to suppress the rebels, save our people from the depths of misery, and drive the ugly invaders out of our territory. The boiling public sentiment will surely serve as the government's backing. Urgent words, the telegram is full of sadness and indignation. Chinese Boai Association, Chinese Women's Rights Movement League, Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, Chinese Social Improvement Association, Shanghai Citizens' Association, and other fourteen groups kowtow.</p>

<h3>Yin Kaisan Makes Flying Arrows in Ping</h3>
<p>▲ Please Assist the Shanghai Support Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter from Yin Kaisan, the inventor of the flying arrow, from Ping, saying: "Respectfully, the flying arrow experiment in Shanghai was greatly assisted and guided by your association. I am extremely grateful. However, due to the tense situation in North China, there is an urgent need for air defense equipment, so I rushed back to Ping. I regret that I was unable to manufacture them in Shanghai. I am now deeply considering and studying with comrades to improve the manufacturing process to ensure practicality. I have gathered workers to start work and believe that this arrow is light, dexterous, inexpensive, and requires little labor. If it can be manufactured in large quantities, it will not be difficult to quickly subdue enemy aircraft. However, due to insufficient funds, I am unable to manufacture them in large quantities, which is a pity. The patriotism of your association's gentlemen is admired by all. I implore you to provide great assistance to promote its success, so that air defense will be prepared and enemy aircraft will be nothing to fear."</p>

<h3>Northeast Volunteer Army Representatives Seek Aid</h3>
<p>▲ Overseas Chinese Willing to Go North to Fight the Enemy</p>
<p>▲ Patriotic Compatriots Urgently Need Support with Ammunition and Winter Clothing</p>
<p>The Kuomin News Agency reports that representatives of the Fourth and Twenty-sixth Route Armies of the Northeast Volunteer Army have come to Shanghai to seek aid from various parties. The efforts are reportedly progressing smoothly. Starting today (the 26th), these representatives will visit various organizations and important figures in the city to report on the situation and request guidance on aid strategies. Furthermore, Jiang Zihang and others, former members of the Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army who fought in the Shanghai Incident, visited the representatives at their lodgings in the past two days. They expressed their willingness to join the Northeast anti-Japanese war but lacked a means to do so. They specifically requested the representatives to provide letters of introduction so they could cross the border and join the volunteer army to fight the enemy. It is said that the representatives of both routes have already sent letters to Commanders Geng Jizhou and Zhang Mingwu, requesting appropriate assignment of work to fulfill their initial aspirations.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Twenty-sixth Route Army of the Northeast National Salvation Army, under Zhang Mingwu, is facing a shortage of ammunition and winter clothing. They have dispatched representatives to the South to seek assistance. Yesterday, the representative sent a letter to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association requesting aid. It reads: "Greetings. Since the September 18th Incident, our loyal and brave volunteer army has sacrificed everything, fought bloody battles for years, and engaged with the violent Japanese, determined to sacrifice their lives and forever hold the determination to sweep away the enemy's lair without any room for appeasement or compromise. The day the Japanese invaders disappear will be the time when our army sheathes its swords and disbands. Our army's work in western Liaoning and the battles we have fought, we believe, are well known to our compatriots across the country. However, we are facing a severe shortage of ammunition and receiving no support, resulting in the loss of previously gained territory. Any patriotic individual should feel heartbroken and urgently seek ways to provide assistance. This time, we were dispatched to the South by our Commander-in-Chief Zhang Mingwu, because our army is in dire need of ammunition, winter clothing, and medical supplies, which are now completely exhausted. Therefore, we are issuing an urgent appeal, relying on the generous support of patriotic compatriots in the rear to facilitate the fight against the enemy. Your esteemed association deeply understands righteousness and is sincerely dedicated to the country, which is highly admired by our army comrades. The front line is about to engage in battle, so please make every effort to provide assistance, which is truly a great act of public service. We hereby send this letter to your esteemed association and request your review and action. Sincerely yours, to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association."</p>

<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Haas Left Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>▲ Soong Zi-wen and Rajchman Personally Saw Them Off</p>
<p>▲ Report to Be Released Simultaneously on the First of Next Month</p>
<p>Mr. Haas, Secretary-General of the League of Nations Northeast Investigation Commission, has completed his work and left Shanghai last night with his wife and secretary, Mr.薛理, on the Empress of Canada steamship for Europe. Soong Zi-wen, Rajchman, and others personally saw them off at the Wusongkou port. Mr. Haas declined to make any statements regarding the report. However, Mr. Haas has left a representative to be stationed temporarily in Nanjing to take charge. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Soong and Others Said Farewell The Jianghai Customs specially prepared the Jinghui small steamer at the pier yesterday afternoon around 2 PM in anticipation of the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Haas. Mr. and Mrs. Haas, along with Soong Zi-wen and his wife, Ms. Zhang Leyi, arrived at the Xinguankou Pier from the Cathay Hotel at 2:20 PM to prepare for departure. After Secretary Xue Li arrived, they boarded the Jinghui small steamer and departed.

<p>▲ Haas Made No Statement Yesterday morning, many Chinese and foreign reporters went to the Cathay Hotel to visit Mr. Haas, but all were refused. When a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Mr. Haas yesterday, they only asked when the report would be sent to Nanjing. He also said he did not know. However, according to Secretary薛理, the report will be released simultaneously in Geneva on October 1st. The date when it will be sent to Nanjing is still undetermined, but it will likely be sent to the Chinese and Japanese governments simultaneously. The report has not yet been translated into Chinese and will likely be handed over to a responsible person on the day of release to begin translation in Peiping. The published version will only be in English. Another person told reporters that after Haas left, he entrusted Mr.奥肯锡凯 (O, kenciky) as his representative to be stationed temporarily in Nanjing, so that a copy of the report in English would be delivered to our government upon publication. The Japanese side also has a similar representative stationed in Tokyo to be responsible.</p>

<h3>Chen Shuren to Go to Hong Kong to Look for Son</h3>
<p>▲ Rumor of Execution of Communist</p>
<p>▲ Coincidentally Shares the Same Name as His Son</p>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that Central Committee member Chen Shuren, due to the long absence of news about his son Chen Jun, and recently hearing rumors that the Guangdong headquarters had executed a communist with the same name as his son, was deeply surprised and personally took the early express train to Shanghai yesterday morning to investigate. According to Chen, "My son has been cautious in his actions since returning from studying in Russia. Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Guangdong side had captured a communist with the same name as my son and executed him. I was quite alarmed because my son has been away for several months without any news. Therefore, I specifically came to Shanghai to transfer to Hong Kong to inquire and clarify the truth. If things in Shanghai are completed, I will take the Changxing Russian Empress ship tomorrow (i.e., today). If I don't hear anything, I will take the Dalian Company's Wilson ship to Guangdong at the latest on the first of next month to conduct an on-site inquiry."</p>

He believes that a considerable foundation has been laid in the city areas outside the concessions. He also consulted with the Weights and Measures Verification Institute and the Weights and Measures Manufacturing Industry Association on issues such as the supply of new instruments and rapid verification. Once the municipal government decides on the date for a major inspection of the concessions, citywide uniformity can be achieved ahead of schedule.</p>

<h3>Low-Salaried Radio Operators of the Ministry of Communications Request Pay Raise</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that there are over two hundred radio operators at the Shanghai Radio General Station on Min Guolu and the International Radio Station on Renjilu, all of whom are diligent in their service.

They also request sympathy and assistance from the High-Salary Radio Operators, Civil Servants, Clerical Staff, Common Welfare Association, and the Messengers Welfare Association.</p>
<h3>Serious Situation in Silk Factory Labor Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Shuang Gong Silk Factory Failed to Resume Work Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Police Authorities Strictly Prevented Worker Assemblies</p>
<p>After female workers in various silk factories in the Hongkou district suddenly launched a general strike demanding increased wages and reduced working hours, the concession area was also affected, and the situation became unusually serious. The situation yesterday is detailed below:</p>
<p>▲ Hongkou Side Yesterday, all single-gong silk factories in Hongkou remained completely shut down. Female workers at the Fulunheng Shuang Gong Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road were originally scheduled to resume work yesterday, but because the female supervisors (i.e., foremen) and staff spoke disrespectfully to the female workers, it aroused public discontent again, and all refused to resume work. Upon hearing the news, the Fourth District Silk Industry Union immediately dispatched two representatives, Dong Xingen and Lu Xusheng, to persuade them. The female workers then raised three demands: (1) Coarse silk strands of 40 to 60 must produce 90 before dismissal; cocoon sorting must exceed 50 jin of total sorting before dismissal; (2) The rules for fine silk strands are extrapolated from this; cocoon sorting must exceed 150 jin of total sorting before dismissal; (3) Coarse silk strands are rewarded from 32 liang upward, and fine silk strands are rewarded from 24 liang upward. After the representatives negotiated with the factory owner Sun Zubei, the result was satisfactory, and work may resume today.</p>
<p>▲ Concession Situation The Longyuan Silk Factory on Alabast Road in the concession area sounded its siren as usual yesterday morning, urging female workers to go to work, but no workers entered the factory. Therefore, the factory immediately stopped the silk looms. Most other silk factories did not sound the siren, and the striking female workers remained quietly at home awaiting a resolution. The situation was quite stable.</p>
<p>▲ Zhabei Prevention Since the silk factories in the Hongkou and concession areas successively launched strikes, Zhabei district, due to strict prevention, was fortunately not affected. Yesterday morning, when the silk factories started work, all the directors of the Sixth District Silk Industry Union, along with staff members, went to the factory gates to wait and persuade the female workers not to act rashly, lest the labor unrest escalate. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau also dispatched police officers to protect them, so the order was very good when work began. No other actions occurred when work began in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲ Party and Government Consultation The City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, in order to quickly seek a resolution to the escalating silk factory labor unrest, sent personnel to investigate the facts. The party and government held consultations yesterday on effective measures to mediate. The Fifth District Third Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau received instructions from the City Public Security Bureau yesterday morning, stating that workers would gather on Tianbao Road in Hongkou at 1 PM for a meeting and should be dissuaded, etc. After receiving the order, the sub-bureau chief Li, accompanied by Inspector Ren Huaipu, led police officers to Tianbao Road and other places for strict prevention. There were no actions until 4 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Mediation Today The City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau have consulted on methods to deal with the silk factory worker strike. Strict prevention measures will be taken in the Zhabei district to avoid being affected. It is reported that it has been decided to convene a silk industry union and trade association at the Social Affairs Bureau at 2 PM this afternoon to mediate in order to prevent the labor unrest from escalating and to seek an early resolution.</p>
<p>▲ Labor-Management Opinions After the silk factory workers in the Hongkou concession area went on strike, Shen Huachen, a committee member of the Silk Factory Industry Association, made an appointment with Yang Shumei, a director of the Third District Silk Industry Union, the night before last to exchange opinions. It is reported that the Silk Factory Industry Association will be responsible for advising various factories on extending working hours, and working hours should not exceed 11 hours. Other matters were studied in detail, and the results were satisfactory, so the labor unrest may not escalate.</p>
<h3>Dockworker Assault Case</h3>
<p>▲ Seven Workers to Be Sent to Court Today</p>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that Xu Jianye and Liu Defu, the newly appointed reorganization committee members of the dockworkers' union, were assaulted by members of the old union and their followers during the takeover the other day. They have been sent to the Nanyang Hospital in Xiaonanmen for treatment. Xu's injuries are more severe than Liu's. Although his fever increased slightly the night before last, it dropped to 37 degrees Celsius yesterday morning. Yesterday, Dr. Gu Nanzhong from the hospital continued to treat him. Liu's injuries have also improved slightly and are expected to heal in about two weeks. Xu is expected to be discharged in four weeks at the latest. Seven workers, Wu Mingfu, Zhou Zhangqing, Wu Desheng, Chen Baode, Feng Binghong, Pu Linqing, and Wang Guangcai, were arrested on the spot for the assault. They were still being held at the Public Security Bureau yesterday due to the holiday and will be transferred to the District Court today for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Robbery and Murder in Bao Long Li, Zhonghua Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 10 AM, a robbery and assault occurred at the home of Yu Rensheng, a resident of No. 2 Bao Long Li, next door to the telephone bureau on Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen, Nanshi. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Co-residing Households in Yu's Residence Yu Rensheng, a 47-year-old man from Wu County, is engaged in the pharmaceutical business. His wife, Ms. Qu, resides with him at No. 2 Bao Long Li, Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen, Nanshi. The house is a two-story Shikumen building with a front door on Bao Long Li and a back door facing Zhonghua Road. In addition to Yu's family, the remaining rooms are rented to Yu's brother-in-law, Qu Guanfu, and a local man, Gu Dianqing.</p>
<p>▲ Robbery Started with Gold Necklace Qu Guanfu is from Baoshan County and is engaged in the miscellaneous candy business. His aunt, Qu Xu, 59 years old, was preparing lunch in the kitchen with Yu's wife, Ms. Qu, around 10 AM yesterday. There were also two maids, one Ms. Jiang, who was stoking the fire under the stove, and one Ms. Wang, 41 years old, from Qingpu, who was cutting a piece of Ding Sheng cake on a table near the back door. Suddenly, two robbers, both dressed in short blue cloth shirts and pants, sneaked in through the back door and went straight into the kitchen. Without saying a word, they grabbed a gold necklace, weighing about one tael and valued at over one hundred yuan, from around Qu Xu's neck, pulling it out from inside her collar. Qu Xu realized she was being robbed and turned to look. She saw two burly robbers standing next to her. Knowing something was wrong, she and Ms. Yu Qu fled into the living room and quickly closed the screen door.</p>
<p>▲ Maid Jiang Suffered Harm The maid Ms. Jiang, who was under the stove, was stunned by the sight. The two robbers, fearing something was amiss due to the closed screen door, intended to return and escape through the back door with the stolen goods. The maid Ms. Wang, who was cutting cake on the table near the door, realized there was a robbery and ran out the back door, intending to call for help. Unexpectedly, just as she stepped out the doorframe, the robbers pulled out their pistols and fired at her. With a loud bang, Ms. Wang fell to the stone steps, shot in the buttocks. The bullet entered from the buttocks and exited from the lower abdomen. Blood flowed like a river, and she lost consciousness. She was immediately taken by car to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. However, the hospital refused to admit her because she was severely injured. She was then transferred to Shanghai Hospital, but due to excessive blood loss and the severity of the injury, she died. Upon learning the news, the Yu family immediately sent someone to Qingpu to notify her family to come to Shanghai to collect the body.</p>
<p>▲ Robbers Fled, Suspects Apprehended When the robbers saw that they had committed a bloody crime, they immediately left and fled. After Ms. Qu Xu and Ms. Yu Qu hid in the living room, they called the family. Only after the robbers left did they come out to investigate. At this time, the local First District Third Sub-bureau had heard the alarm, and the sub-bureau chief Jin personally led a large team of police officers to patrol and search everywhere. Two suspects were apprehended and taken back for interrogation.</p>
<p>(Lewd Hell) Novel</p>
<h3>Accusation of Insulting Performers</h3>
<p>▲ Saying Liu Han Chen Is Having an Affair with Concubine</p>
<p>▲ Jun Yu Clearly Refers to Zhao Jun Yu</p>
<p>▲ Mao Yun Ge Alludes to Mao Yun Ke</p>
<p>▲ Store Owner and Author Both Accused</p>
<p>The recently published novel (Lewd Hell) by Sha Buqi, published by Zha Luolan Bookstore on Fuzhou Road, contains many anecdotes involving the performing arts world. Such as "(Gao Sankui and Liu Hanchen, two actors, had an affair with Chu Yupu's concubine, pulling Jun Yu into it, so he was happy to eat tofu in the middle)", "(That Captain reached out and slapped Jun Yu twice on the mouth)", "(Mao Yunge relies on her daughter, the Chang Lao Ban)", "(That doctor's family is very wealthy, and he is very obsessed with his daughter, thinking it is an unsurpassed opportunity, so he instructed Jianmei to encourage him in his words to take out capital to jointly run a theater, and sure enough, the doctor took the bait)", "(Liu Hanchen is having an affair with Chu Yupu's Fifth Concubine, of course he paid a lot, so he wears a diamond ring on his finger and a gray coat on his body)", "(The Third Concubine, the Fifth Concubine, Gao Sankui, Liu Hanchen, all jumped into the car and went straight to the front of a hotel)", etc., are the most eye-catching in the book. The performers mentioned, except for Liu Hanchen, who was Liu Kunrong's younger brother and died years ago, such as Jun Yu, clearly referring to Zhao Junyu, and Mao Yunge alluding to Mao Yunke, are all known to those familiar with the opera scene. Therefore, Zhao Junyu, Mao Yunke, and Liu Kunrong all believe that the descriptions in the book are unfounded rumors that fabricate facts and damage their reputations. Therefore, they have jointly hired lawyers to file a criminal complaint against the author Sha Buqi and the manager of the publisher Zha Luolan Bookstore in the First Special District District Court, requesting legal action and attaching a civil lawsuit seeking compensation of one thousand yuan for each person's losses. All the words in the book involving each performer are included in the complaint, and the reasons why Mao Yunge is actually alluding to Mao Yunke are stated, saying that not only are the characters different but the sounds are the same, and Yunke's daughter is named Mao Jianpei, while the book calls Mao Yunge's daughter Mao Jianmei, which is also a different character but the same sound, but there is no Mao Yunge in the performing arts world. Furthermore Mao Jianmei entered the film industry, studied with Wang Yaoqing, and later committed suicide. Therefore it can be presumed that it refers to Yunke and her dead daughter Jianpei, without any doubt. The defendants did not dare to write their names directly, trying to deceive and insinuate, further proving that they knew the rumors were false but deliberately damaged the reputation of Yunke and others, intending to insult them. Therefore, they jointly filed a complaint, requesting that the defendants be punished in accordance with Article 325, Paragraph 2, Article 328, Article 329, Paragraph 2, Article 42, and Article 69 of the Criminal Law, combined with punishment, and requesting that the verdict be published in accordance with Article 332 of the Criminal Law, with the defendants bearing the costs. As for the attached civil lawsuit, (1) they requested a judgment prohibiting the sale of the Lewd Hell book; (2) they ordered the defendants to jointly compensate the plaintiffs for 1,000 yuan each for their reputational losses, etc. Upon receiving the complaint, the court immediately issued subpoenas to the defendants and scheduled a public hearing within days.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Third Factory Labor Dispute Settles</h3>
<p>▲ Factory Accepts All Worker Demands</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Far East News Agency reports that over four hundred male and female workers in the leaf department of the Anglo-American Tobacco Company's third branch factory on Yangshupu Ward Road, due to the factory firing two male workers, changing the piece-rate system, and increasing the weight per pound, went on strike at 2:00 PM on the twenty-third to demand that the factory reinstate the fired workers, continue the piece-rate system, and not increase the weight per pound. By 9:00 AM the day before yesterday (the twenty-fourth), the workers, seeing that the factory owner had not responded, immediately went on strike. The workers then went to the tin-packing department, the machining department, the box department, and the canning department, ordering the workers in each department to strike in solidarity. As a result, all the factory workers went on strike. The factory manager, Mr. Weissbrodt, seeing the unfavorable situation, immediately telegraphed the general factory manager, Mr. Haig, for instructions. After some consideration, Mr. Haig telegraphed Mr. Weissbrodt, ordering him to accept all the workers' demands. Mr. Weissbrodt immediately informed the workers, who were all satisfied and resumed work at 1:00 PM that afternoon, thus ending the dispute.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Organs to Mediate British Tramway Labor Dispute Today</h3>
<p>The Third District Water and Electricity Workers Union, organized by workers of the Shanghai Electric Tramways Company in the Public Concession, has been established under the guidance of party and government organs. After the company dismissed the three executive directors, He Zhaoming, Gong Hongfa, and Fang Xiuyan, without cause, the union immediately reported to the party and government organs, requesting mediation on (1) reinstating the dismissed workers and (2) paying wages for the dismissal period. The day before yesterday, the City Party Headquarters sent Zhou Lianze, an officer from the Civil Training Section, and the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhu Guilin, a mediator from the Third Section, to jointly investigate the truth of the matter with the company and the union. It is reported that the reason given by the company's management was that He Zhaoming and others, as those responsible for organizing the union, were deemed detrimental to the company. The City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau believe that He Zhaoming and others in the Third District Water and Electricity Workers Union are all executive directors of the union and that their work has been very good and without fault. They have now been dismissed by the company for organizing the union, and a solution will be sought. Yesterday, the union was notified to appoint two responsible representatives to attend the bureau at 2:00 PM on the twenty-sixth of this month to await questioning.</p>
<h3>Ministry Order to Pay Attention to Ramie Cloth Stagnation in Korea</h3>
<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, which stated: "To whom it may concern: We have received Instruction No. 13347 from the Ministry of Industry, which states, regarding instructions, 'We have received a dispatch from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the Consul-General in Keijo, Guo Fengfang, reported that the import of ramie cloth from our country to Korea has been decreasing since the 19th year of the Republic. Recently, the Incheon Customs has also announced an increase in the import tax on ramie cloth, and the Keijo Prefecture of Korea is actively promoting self-sufficiency in ramie, the plan for which should be noted. Please forward this to the Ministry of Industry for review.' Furthermore, the Consul in Gishu, Zhu Fu, reported that 'Recently, it has been found that the Governor-General of Korea also has a plan to block the import of ramie cloth from our country. Please forward this to the Ministry of Industry to instruct ramie cloth industrialists to ensure that the quality, size, color, and fiber thickness of ramie cloth for sale in various regions of Korea are suitable for Korean tastes in order to compete and save the last chance for ramie cloth exports from our country.' The translated report and other documents are attached. While we were reviewing the matter, we received a further report from the Consul-General in Keijo stating that regarding the Incheon Customs' increase in ramie cloth tax, the Incheon Office was instructed to negotiate reasonably. The Chief of the Inspection Section of Incheon Customs stated that there are some deficiencies in the procedures for collecting supplementary taxes, but if the merchants agree to handle the matter, the customs will be lenient with those that are slightly different from 19 inches in the future. We have instructed the merchants to write to the place of origin or agents that the width of Korean ramie cloth should not exceed 18.7 inches to maintain the rights and interests of the agreement and avoid being manipulated. We hereby submit a report on the handling process along with copies for your review, and we request that you forward this to the Ministry of Industry for review, ordering domestic ramie cloth weavers or sales managers to pay close attention to the width and the number of lines per 5 square millimeters of ramie cloth when weaving ramie cloth for Korea, in accordance with the items listed in Part B, Section 1 of the Sino-Japanese Agreement, so as to avoid wasting tax money and increasing burdens.' We have already responded to your ministry's Business Letter No. 5809, stating that we have instructed domestic hemp cloth merchants to be informed, as reported by the Consul in Gishu regarding the Korean Weaving Association's plan to resist the import of our hemp cloth in July of last year. Now, according to the reports submitted by the consulates one after another, the resistance is becoming more and more intensified. Regarding how our country's ramie cloth industry should strive for improvement, and regarding the width of the cloth, it should be in accordance with the Sino-Japanese Agreement, paying close attention to achieving benefits and preventing losses. We are copying the original reports and attached documents from each consulate for your ministry to review and handle." Also attached are copies of each document. According to this, after reviewing Item 2 of Attachment 1 to the Sino-Japanese Agreement, it was stated that the Japanese government would maintain the tax rates listed in Part B for three years, but Item 1 of Part B stated that those exceeding 48 cm were excluded. According to the conversion of weights and measures of various countries, each inch is equal to 2.53995 cm, so 19 inches is equal to 48.259 cm, and 48 cm is approximately equal to 18.7 inches. Also, after reviewing the current Japanese import tariff, Item 5, Category 29, Section C, Item 1, untwisted fabrics, (A), the weight per 100 square meters should not exceed 40 kg. The regulations for the density of warp and weft threads per 5 square millimeters are (1) not exceeding 10 threads, 12.00 per 100 catties; (2) not exceeding 20 threads, 22.00 per 100 catties; (3) not exceeding 30 threads, 40.00 per 100 catties; (4) not exceeding 40 threads, 60.00 per 100 catties; (5) others, 80.00 per 100 catties; (B) others, 15.00 per 100 catties; C, 2. others, add 12 yuan to the tariff rate of the untwisted fabrics. According to the above points, the number of threads per 5 square millimeters of ramie cloth has already been stipulated, and it is impossible to propose a separate tax rate of 35% for those exceeding 19 threads per 5 square millimeters. The Sino-Japanese Agreement has not yet expired, and taxes should not be increased. The width of Korean ramie cloth imported from our country is mostly around 19 inches, and only one or two types exceed this width, and the amount is limited. However, our country's ramie cloth is woven by hand, and its dimensions and number of threads are not uniform. In the future, domestic cloth merchants should ensure that the width of ramie cloth shipped to Korea does not exceed 18.7 inches to maintain the rights and interests of the agreement. Also, the number of threads per 5 square millimeters should be in accordance with the items listed in Part B, Section 1 of the Sino-Japanese Agreement, paying close attention to avoiding wasting tax money and increasing burdens. In addition to replying, the original attached documents are copied and issued to the Bureau for notification, and domestic ramie cloth manufacturers are informed to pay close attention to this. This is extremely important. This order, along with two original reports from the Consul-General in Keijo, one translated document, and four copies, and one original report from the Consul in Gishu, are being sent to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. It is hoped that you will review this and inform domestic ramie cloth manufacturers to pay close attention to maintain foreign trade. With utmost sincerity, this is addressed to the National General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Shareholders of Shenzhou Hotel Accuse Directors and Managers of Colluding in Fraud</h3>
<p>▲ Fictitious Real Estate Company</p>
<p>▲ Questionable Construction Accounts</p>
<p>Chen Changkun, Chen Heting, and Dong Zhenlong, the executive directors and manager of the Shenzhou Hotel, have recently been discovered by shareholders Zhang Xianmin, Yu Xiangrui, Xie Dechen, and others to be colluding in fraud, harming the interests of the shareholders. They have hired lawyers Yuan Hanyun, Wu Linkun, Wang Fushang, and Yuan Yang'an to file a lawsuit with the First Special District District Court, requesting legal prosecution. The lawsuit roughly states that the defendants initiated the opening of the hotel in the 17th year [of the Republic], claiming to be organizing a joint-stock company, but have not yet registered with the ministry. The location is on Fuzhou Road, and they planned to build a large five-story Western-style building there, boasting that the scale would be exceptionally large and the business would inevitably flourish. The plaintiffs and others pooled their shares, but the defendants had early intentions. In addition to purchasing land in the south to build their own houses, they rented land from Hongmao Company in the north to build houses. Chen Changkun, Chen Heting, and others established a fictitious Wuchang Company, which rented this land from Hongmao on April 1 of the 17th year [of the Republic] for a monthly rent of 1,800 taels of silver, with a term of 20 years. Then, Wuchang Company, in turn, rented this land to the Shenzhou Hotel for a monthly rent of 2,550 taels of silver, with a term of 15 years. Both were signed at the same time. Upon investigation, the representatives signing the lease between Wuchang and Hongmao were Chen Changkun and Chen Heting, while the representative signing the lease between Wuchang and the Shenzhou Hotel was Manager Dong Zhenlong, and the representative of Wuchang was again Chen Heting, a director of the hotel. In this transfer, the defendants could obtain an illegal profit of 750 taels of silver per month. Throughout this process, a shareholders' meeting was never held to report everything. Examining the establishment of the fictitious Wuchang Company, the illegal benefits that the defendants could obtain through collusion are (1) collecting 750 taels of silver more in rent from the Shenzhou Hotel each month, (2) the lease between Wuchang Company and the Shenzhou Hotel shortened the lease term by five years compared to the lease between Wuchang and Hongmao Company. The estimated illegal profit to be gained in these five years is over 100,000 taels, (3) according to the lease between Wuchang and Hongmao, there is a commission for the design of building the houses, which is not small, and was completely embezzled by the defendants and not turned over to the company. The illegal profits obtained by the defendants in violation of their duties in the above three items are already so large, but that's not all. (1) The construction of the Shenzhou Hotel was entirely contracted by Chen Changkun alone, amounting to over 170,000 taels of silver. There is no contracting agreement to verify, nor is there a clear accounting report. The magnitude of the malpractice is evident upon estimation. (2) The hotel buildings, whether in the south or north, were built with funds from Shenzhou, but Wuchang Company suddenly appointed a lawyer to publish an advertisement, falsely claiming to be owned by Wuchang Company. The illegal profits already obtained are not enough, and they want to embezzle the houses built with the shareholders' capital. It is beyond doubt that the defendants are jointly committing the crime of breach of trust under Article 366, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code and should be sentenced to the appropriate crime, and an incidental civil lawsuit should be filed according to law, requesting a judgment (1) that the illegal lease between Wuchang Company and the Shenzhou Hotel be canceled immediately, and that the lease between Wuchang Company and Hongmao Company be transferred to the Shenzhou Hotel (2) that the illegal rent obtained by the defendants, 750 taels of silver per month, from April of the 17th year [of the Republic] to February of this year, totaling 35,250 taels of silver, be returned to the Shenzhou Hotel to punish evil and protect the good." Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Cixun opened a court session to summon the defendants, but both Chens did not appear, and only Dong Zhenlong appeared in court. The plaintiff's lawyer, Yuan Hanyun, asked the judge to question the defendant about whether there were any other transactions other than the one with Shenzhou since the defendant's Wuchang Company, which claims to be in the real estate business, was established in the 17th year [of the Republic]. The court then turned to Dong Zhenlong, who claimed not to know. Lawyer Yuan then requested that the defendant Chen Heting be ordered to submit all leases and account books within five days for examination. Judge Ge also immediately instructed Chen's lawyer in court to instruct the defendant to comply. However, the case was adjourned for further questioning because the witnesses were not all present.</p>
<h3>Guan Zhangwen's Hardship Facing Deceased Friend</h3>
<p>▲ Embezzlement of Orphans' and Widows' Inheritance</p>
<p>▲ Guan Zitain Trusted the Wrong Person</p>
<p>Guan Zhangwen, manager of Guangfuhe Pharmacy on Jiujiang Road, was previously a close friend of Guan Zitian. In the 12th year of the Republic [1923], Zitian suffered from a severe illness and, knowing that he would not recover, invited Zhangwen to his bedside during his illness. He entrusted his wife and children to him, and instructed his wife, Ms. Feng, to take out all of his lifetime savings in various securities and hand them over to Zhangwen in person for safekeeping, to avoid them being coveted by others in the hands of the widow and orphans. Zhangwen accepted the order with caution, vowing not to fail the trust. Therefore, since Zitian's death, nearly ten years have passed, and Ms. Feng and her son Guichang have been able to live on the money. However, Zhangwen has recently changed his mind and has gradually mortgaged the securities and stocks under his custody for his own use. When Guan's family learned of this, they led their son Guichang to question him. Zhangwen knew that it would be difficult to hide, and admitted it directly, but there was no way to return the items. The mother and son then hired lawyer Lu Shaozong to file a lawsuit with the First Special District District Court, and listed the types of securities and stocks embezzled by Guan Zhangwen, including (1) consolidated financial public bonds with a face value of 26,470 yuan, (2) consolidated 6% public bonds with a face value of 168,120 yuan, (3) consolidated 7% public bonds with a face value of 33,500 yuan, (4) 7-year large-denomination public bonds with a face value of 21,717 yuan, (5) 386 shares of the Bank of Communications, (6) 130 shares of the Bank of Communications, (7) 283 shares of the Central Trust Company, (8) 8 shares of the Shanghai Telephone Company, etc., with a total value of a considerable amount. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge of the court opened a court session to summon the case, but the defendant Guan Zhangwen had already fled Shanghai and his whereabouts were unknown, so the case could not proceed. The judge ordered the suspension of the trial proceedings and will investigate further after the defendant is arrested.</p>

<h3>Hostage Rescued on Wuding Road</h3>
<p>▲ Qiao Xiaocun from Qingpu</p>
<p>Zhao Zhen, the captain of the Second Detachment of the First District of the Jiangsu Water Police, led detectives Chen Lianxiang, Xie Xianglian, and Chen Qichang, along with Chinese detectives Feng and Wang dispatched by the Public Concession Police, to rescue a hostage at No. 437 Wuding Road, upstairs in a pancake shop, and arrested five male and female kidnappers. The details are as follows: Qiao Guanxiang, 40 years old, resides in Datieqiao, Qingpu County, and is a carpenter. His family is very poor. He has a son named Qiao Xiaocun, who is only ten years old. On the afternoon of August 10th this year, six kidnappers suddenly broke into his house and kidnapped his son Xiaocun. After losing his son, Qiao wondered why his family, which was so poor, was coveted by bandits. While he was anxious, the bandits also realized that they had kidnapped the wrong person. On August 18th, they sent a letter to Qiao, demanding 200 yuan in foreign currency for ransom. Qiao, because he really did not have this money, ignored them. On September 22nd, they sent another letter, saying that if he did not come to redeem him, not only would they tear up the ticket, but they would also burn his house. Qiao had no choice but to secretly report to the second detachment captain, who ordered an investigation. Later, on the 23rd, they sent another letter, inviting Qiao to contact them at the China Hotel on Ermalu in the Public Concession. Therefore, Qiao reported to Captain Zhao, who brought detectives Chen and Xie to Shanghai yesterday at noon to meet with the police. They waited inside the hotel, while instructing Qiao to wait outside the door. After a while, three bandits came to contact Qiao, and the detectives rushed forward and captured them at the intersection of Ermalu and Shilu. They were immediately taken back to the police station. After interrogation by the police chief, the bandits confessed that one was Liang Guisheng from Hubei, one was Zhang Changlin from Ningbo, and one was Wu Mingchang from Ningbo. They also confessed that the hostage was hidden upstairs in a pancake shop at No. 437 Wuding Road. The bandits were all deserters from the former 78th Division, and all the guns were with Squad Leader Shi. The detectives then went to the pancake shop at the address and rescued the hostage Qiao Xiaocun. They also arrested a woman watching the hostage, Liang Yu, and a bandit woman, Hu Yan, at No. 1999 Dongyouheng Road. They were all taken back to the police station to await review and investigation by the court. Captain Zhao has prepared a document to transfer them to the detachment for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Progress of Railway Responsible Transportation Preparation</h3>
<p>▲ Report by Yu Yan, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, at the Commemoration Week</p>
<p>Fellow comrades, responsible transportation is a very common system in Eastern and Western countries, and it is not a novel concept in our country. As early as the Seventh Year of the Republic (1918), there was talk of responsible transportation during the transportation conference. In the Tenth Year of the Republic (1921), the Beijing Ministry of Communications promulgated the General Rules for Responsible Transportation, although the content was very imperfect. However, it was not until the recent promulgation of the new General Rules that it was officially abolished. However, due to the frequent wars in the country over the past ten years, even this imperfect General Rule could not be implemented. Only the Siping-Taonan Railway first implemented it, and then the railways in the Northeast gradually adopted it. This was the beginning of the implementation of responsible transportation on Chinese railways. As for the railways within Shanhaiguan, such as the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, in order to absorb the freight from the Northeast railways last year, they also implemented responsible transportation at key stations, with great success. In the summer of this year, I, the humble servant, took over the Business Department and realized that responsible transportation is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and is not just a matter for the railway itself. It was imperative that we could no longer delay. Under the instructions of the Minister and Vice-Minister, we resolutely proceeded. We were ordered to organize a Goods Responsible Transportation Committee, and Mr. Tan Yaozong from this department, based on his years of experience in establishing responsible transportation on the railways in the Northeast and the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, convened experts to meet daily. First, we formulated the procedures for implementing responsible transportation on each railway, and then drafted various rules and regulations. At that time, it was the height of summer, and all government agencies stopped working in the afternoon, but the committee met every day from morning to evening to discuss the rules and regulations without interruption. Sometimes, due to a problem that could not be resolved, the meeting was extended until late at night. Each day's work lasted for more than twelve hours. Thanks to the efforts of all members, ten kinds of rules and regulations and fifty-nine kinds of forms were completed in a short period of time: (1) General Rules for Responsible Transportation of Freight Cars (47 articles); (2) Detailed Rules for Responsible Transportation of Freight Cars (151 articles); (3) 47 kinds of various forms and registers; (4) Regulations on Bills of Lading (20 articles); (5) Notice to Merchants Attached to Bills of Lading (16 articles); (6) Detailed Rules for Handling Bills of Lading (19 articles); (7) 12 kinds of Bill of Lading formats; (8) Methods for Using Tarpaulins and Ropes; (9) Methods for Handling Less-than-Carload Freight; (10) Measures for Road Police Escorting Freight Cars. After the above-mentioned rules and regulations were formulated and promulgated, responsible transportation was able to be implemented on schedule on September 1st on the Jinpu, Beijing-Shanghai, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. The Responsible Transportation Committee continued to draft rules for freight handlers undertaking loading and unloading, service rules for hiring loaders and unloaders, methods for calculating freight charges, methods for distributing vehicles, and methods for supervising responsible transportation, in order to perfect the various rules and regulations. All of this belongs to the internal efforts and planning of the Ministry. As for the situation of the railways implementing responsible transportation, I will briefly describe it as follows. According to the implementation procedures for responsible transportation set by the Ministry, the first to implement it were the Jinpu, Beijing-Shanghai, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. The Ministry had ordered preparations in advance, and during the preparation period, the amount of freight at each station along the route and whether the warehouses could meet the needs were investigated in detail. It was decided that the Jinpu Railway would temporarily implement it at stations south of Xuzhou, while the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways would select eight stations, including Nanjing Jiangbian, Xiaguan, Maigen Road, Shanghai North Station, South Station, Xinlonghua, Zhabei, and Nanxingqiao, to implement it. After each station was selected, the respective railways selected freight personnel in charge to come to the Ministry. On August 19th, a training meeting on responsible transportation was held, and the committee members gave speeches on the procedures to be known when implementing responsible transportation, and the various rules and regulations were explained in detail to ensure that they were understood clearly. After the staff returned to their respective railways, they went separately to guide the staff at each station implementing responsible transportation so that there would be no obstacles during implementation. At the same time, this department held meetings in Beijing and Shanghai on August 26th and 27th, respectively, to entertain</p>
<p>various chambers of commerce, banking circles, and the press to explain the true meaning of responsible transportation. As a result, the society also expressed sympathy for this initiative. However, a small number of transshipment businesses and grain merchants who also engaged in transshipment opposed it in their own self-interest, with the priority and highest priority of responsible transportation prices and the issue of responsibility in the General Rules as the target of opposition. This department proved with various legitimate reasons that the above-mentioned items were based on legal principles, reason, and international practice, and pointed out that the opposition of the transshipment businesses was unreasonable and had other motives. The special party headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways also strongly refuted it. At the same time, the Ministry also printed many copies of the answers to the transshipment businesses and distributed them to various merchants in order to promote universal understanding, so the matter subsided. On September 1st, the Jinpu, Beijing-Shanghai, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways simultaneously implemented the new policy on schedule. At the beginning of the new policy, many merchants were not very clear about the rules and regulations, so the initial days were almost entirely spent on answering questions. After a few days, the merchants all understood the speed and reliability of responsible transportation, and that it was more economical than transshipment by transshipment companies before responsible transportation, so they reported for transportation one after another. Therefore, freight increased greatly after one or two days, and it has continued to increase to this day. The goods transported by each railway have not suffered any losses. Those who only advertised the benefits of responsible transportation in words and orally in the past have now had the facts to prove it. Now, let me give an example of the freight situation after the implementation of responsible transportation on the Jinpu, Beijing-Shanghai, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. According to the daily telegram tonnage of each railway, listed as follows: The order of freight increase after the Jinpu Railway implemented responsible transportation on September 1st: September 1st, 340 tons; September 4th, 490 tons; September 6th, 600 tons; September 9th, 800 tons; September 13th, 1,790 tons. As of September 15th, a total of more than 12,000 tons of responsible freight were transported. The order of freight increase after the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways implemented responsible transportation on September 1st: September 1st, 140 tons; September 2nd, 320 tons; September 6th, 836 tons; September 9th, 1,056 tons; September 13th, 1,613 tons. As of September 15th, a total of more than 15,000 tons of responsible freight were transported. The above-mentioned freight increase is sufficient to prove that responsible transportation is the only way to benefit merchants, railways, the country, and the people, and should be supported by the society. We also hope that colleagues in the Ministry will give guidance, encouragement, and supervision to promote it to all railways in the country. It is not only the luck of the railway, but the future of the national economy really relies on it.</p>

(12) Education funding has long been clearly stipulated to be independent, but the county governments in various places still do not comply with this order and misappropriate it without authorization. After the Education Bureau reported it to the provincial departments, they ordered it to be returned, but it was still ineffective. How should it be handled? Please make a public decision. Resolution: Enter the ninth proposal for handling. (13) How should the counties with uncleared arrears of grain taxes and uncleared handover by previous directors be thoroughly cleared? Resolution: Please ask the Department of Education to stipulate special measures for each county to clear the arrears of grain taxes and settle accounts, and order each county to strictly comply, or send a special commissioner to handle the clearing of arrears of grain taxes and handover matters in each county. (14) Please rectify the accumulated malpractices in the collection of education fees in Jiangsu. Resolution: Handed over to the second group of reviewers to formulate measures. (15) Study and rectify the measures for arrears of field taxes in each county to repay the arrears of teachers' salaries. Resolution: Incorporated into the thirteenth proposal for handling. (16) Due to the reduced collection of busy Cao, the surtaxes for education have become more and more numerous, and local education cannot be maintained. How should it be remedied? Resolution: Incorporated into the thirteenth proposal for handling. (17) Request the provincial government to issue a notice to all counties to clear and pay the land price tax on schedule. Resolution: Passed. (18) Please ask the Department of Education to suggest to the Provincial Government that when the Department of Finance sends personnel to each county to collect the regular tax or fill out various payment orders in the future, the surtax should be cleared. Resolution: Passed. (19) It has been found that the Provincial Government has sent committees to clear the old debts of each county and the local education surtax, which should of course also be included in the clearance. However, the provincial committees and the bureaus of each county only pay attention to the clearance of provincial taxes according to orders and ignore the education surtax. How should we proceed to enrich education fees? Resolution: Passed as is. (Measures) Please submit it to the Provincial Government meeting for discussion and approval by the Department of Education as soon as possible, and notify the provincial committees and the bureaus of each county that when clearing old debts, the local education surtax should also be responsible for clearing it together with the provincial tax. Whether it is advance payment or continued collection, it should be proposed separately at any time to clarify the boundaries. (20) Request the Provincial Government and the Department of Finance to collect all the local education surtaxes and mu tax collected by each county from the twelfth year of the Republic (1923) without being affected by the autumn survey reduction, and collect them in full to enrich local education funding. Resolution: Retained. (21) Local surtaxes should also be subject to overdue fines to avoid delays. Resolution: 1. Penalties will be imposed in two phases for exceeding the deadline. 2. Each phase will be subject to a fine of 5% of the overdue surtax. 3. Report to the Provincial Government for approval and implementation. (22) Please discuss the proposal to levy overdue fines for education mu tax to offset the original arrears added to the county. Resolution: Incorporated into the twenty-first proposal for handling. (23) Gradually increase the mu tax for universal education to implement social education for profit and righteousness. (24) The balance of each county's land price tax that is less than the 1/100 limit should be increased as much as possible for the mu tax for universal education. (The above two proposals were discussed together.) Resolution: Report to the Department of Education and forward it to the Provincial Government to order each county to increase the mu tax for universal education as much as possible in one year from this year for counties where the land price tax is less than the limit. (25) The salt field tax of each county should be taken over by the county government for management when the audit office also manages salt administration to facilitate the collection of education mu tax. (26) In coastal counties, the increase in the mu tax for universal education on salt land has been disapproved by the Lianghuai Salt Transport Envoy on the grounds that it hinders the regular tax. How should it be handled? (The above two proposals were discussed together.) Resolutions: 1. Report to the Department of Education and forward it to the Provincial Government to consult the Ministry of Finance and order the Salt Affairs Audit Office to transfer the matter of increasing donations from salt fields to the county government for management. 2. The Department of Education should request the Provincial Government to consult the Ministry of Finance and order the Lianghuai Transport Office to approve the increase in the mu tax for universal education at any time within the prescribed collection scope for the Education Bureaus of each county with salt land, such as the combined positive and negative taxes, and has not exceeded 1% of the land price to facilitate the process. (27) Overdue fines should be retained locally to promote compulsory education. (28) Local tax revenue overdue fines should still be allocated to local education funding to implement compulsory education experimental zones. (29) Proposed that 50% of the education fees under overdue fines should still maintain the original proposal and be exempted from being submitted to the province. (30) Please discuss whether it is feasible to deduct and request the restoration of overdue fines to be used as local education funding for relief. (31) Proposed that overdue fines should still be allocated half of the county's education expenses according to the approved plan. (32) Please retain half of the overdue fine for busy Cao to supplement local education funding or appropriately add a fine of 5% to offset it. (33) All overdue fines were submitted to the province, and it is proposed to present them separately to the Provincial Government and the Department of Finance to collect 30% of the education fees from the business tax items of each county to compensate for the deficit and maintain the original cause. (34) We were ordered to cancel the education retention of overdue fines and cut down on the collection of miscellaneous taxes at checkpoints, resulting in a huge deficit in education fees. We should find ways to raise funds to make up for it. (The above nine proposals were discussed together.) Resolution: The Department of Education should report to the Provincial Government and still allocate the overdue fines to each county to be used exclusively for compulsory education. (35) It is proposed to restore the county's education funding in the winter Cao with an additional two yuan or approve the addition of Cao according to the number to offset it. Resolution: Handle according to the above proposal.</p>

<h3>The First Act of the Culling Cup Tournament</h3>
<p>Donghua Defeats Western Police</p>
<p>▲ Result: Three to Zero</p>
<p>▲ Audience of Over Ten Thousand</p>
<p>The first act of the Culling Cup tournament between Donghua and Western Police was held at the China Baseball Field at 3 p.m. yesterday. The audience was as large as 12,000. The area around Father Rho Avenue was filled with cars, and the baseball field was surrounded by crowds. The scene was truly rare. As a result, Donghua defeated Western Police by a score of three to zero. The referee was Yue Xiurong. The lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Donghua</p>
<p>Tu Kaiyuan　Qian Jingyong</p>
<p>Li Ning　　　　　Chen Hongguang Down</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan　　Ma Yunyou　Li Yicheng</p>
<p>Guan Xunan　　　　Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Wu Youliang　Cao Qiuting Up</p>
<p>▲ Western Police</p>
<p>Xu Tu　　He Lei　　Bie Jieshi</p>
<p>Aide Men　　　　　　轧 Xu　　Tou Na</p>
<p>Stoke　　Jackson　　Falas</p>
<p>Jie Ke</p>
<p>Oakley</p>
<p>▲ First Half: No Score</p>
<p>The two sides clashed and the situation was even. Donghua had many scoring opportunities, but none were successful. The Western Police forwards aggressively invaded, but Donghua's defense was extremely solid and impeccable. Donghua's Li Yichen made a shot and the ball was very fast, rolling towards the corner of the goal. The Western Police goalkeeper dived to save it. Later, Chen Jiaqiu made a powerful shot, but it hit the crossbar and bounced back. Although the Donghua forwards were extremely brave, they lacked connection at critical moments and failed to achieve anything. Neither side scored in the first half.</p>
<h3>The Highly Anticipated Senior Singles Tennis Quarterfinals in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Could Have Won But Lost to De Fu</p>
<p>▲ Victory Turns into Defeat | 1,600 People Sigh in Unison</p>
<p>▲ Admired for His Skills | Though He Lost in Three Sets, He Fought Hard</p>
<p>| Qiu Feihai Leads Lin Baohua Two to One and Awaits Continuation |</p>
<p>Yesterday's senior singles quarterfinals at the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club, where the Four Knights of Shanghai met, with Zheng Zhaojia vs. De Fu and Lin Baohua vs. Qiu Feihai, attracted 1,600 to 1,700 spectators, a rare sight at this year's tennis tournament. As a result of the battle, Zheng Zhaojia unfortunately lost to De Fu in a winnable situation. However, Zheng's performance was greatly admired, without any doubt. He will definitely be a champion in the future. In the match between Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, Qiu led Lin Baohua by two sets to one. Due to darkness, the match was suspended and the date for the continuation will be announced tomorrow. De Fu will face Qiu or Lin in the final to win this year's championship.</p>
<h3>▲Zheng Zhaojia, Though Defeated, Still Honorable</h3>
<p>▲The Splendor of the Match: Amidst applause, an old general and a young man stepped onto the court to battle. Zheng Zhaojia served the ball first, delivering four consecutive successful serves, and then lost a game. However, without panic, he returned the favor with a clean sweep in the third game, winning three consecutive games and taking a 3-2 lead. Zheng unleashed powerful forehand and backhand shots, both long and short, forcing De Fu to run tirelessly. Continuing the battle, he established a dominant lead of 5-3. Winning just one more game, Zheng could have seized the initiative and gained a crucial advantage.</p>
<p>▲The Painful Defeat: This was the ninth game, decisive for the first set. Zheng indeed took the lead with one point, needing just one more point to secure the victory. Unexpectedly, De Fu managed to tie the score at 3-3. After two instances of equal scores, Zheng Zhaojia lost this most crucial game. In the next game, De Fu served and tied the score at 5-5, drastically changing the situation, making the outcome uncertain. 6-6, 7-7, each server won their serve. 8-8, 9-9, the servers failed again. Zheng Zhaojia ultimately lost the first set 10-12.</p>
<p>▲Vitality Greatly Impaired: This first set, which seemed firmly within his grasp, was lost, dampening his initial courage and causing a setback. The second set was inferior to the first. De Fu, having overcome this difficult hurdle, gained momentum in the second set and suddenly won with a score of 5-2. Although Zheng Zhaojia bravely fought back and won two games, he still lost the second set 4-6. Zheng's vitality was greatly impaired, leading to an irreversible situation in the third set. After 1-1, he lost five consecutive games, finishing 1-6, with De Fu winning three consecutive sets.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Zhaojia Is Good: Although Zheng Zhaojia lost in three sets, the intense battles in between were clear for all to see. Zheng Zhaojia's performance in the first set was superb, leaving the old general feeling inferior. His elegant posture was unique in Shanghai. De Fu struggled to respond to his diverse shots, both long and short, to the left and right. His two mid-court smashes were exactly as seen in pictures of Barlow/Brookes. Only De Fu could return this kind of smash. His slices along the sidelines were fast and accurate, earning him many points. His various strokes showed he had mastered the basics. With more practice and assurance, he would achieve perfection. Areas for improvement include greater foresight and quicker movements, as he missed some killable balls. His smashes, though returned, could be faster. With these improvements, he would be perfect. Given his performance against a Davis Cup player, his defeat is still honorable, and his future is limitless. Encouragement to Zhaojia!</p>
<p>▲De Fu Deserves Admiration: De Fu's performance in the final two sets fully restored his golden era from when he won the championship last year. Truly, it was a battle between worthy opponents. He saved many balls that were difficult for Zheng Zhaojia to return. His high volleys and long reach allowed him to smash the ball with ease. His serves were no less powerful than Lin Baohua's, and perhaps even more so. His crisp smashes were befitting of a renowned player. Zheng Zhaojia sought his advice after the match, and De Fu frequently expressed his delight at Zheng's rapid progress.</p>
<h3>▲Qiu Feihai Holds the Advantage</h3>
<p>▲Completely Different Strokes: Qiu and Lin followed Zheng and De in the battle, with completely different strokes from the previous group, providing a change of pace. Zheng and De's attacks were well-planned and clearly executed. Qiu and Lin knew each other well. Lin started the first six games using slice shots to counter Qiu's powerful baseline drives, but with little effect. Each won their serve, tying at 3-3. Qiu suddenly broke Lin's serve and continued using his favored angled drives, occasionally volleying and using soft drop shots, winning two consecutive games and taking the first set 6-4.</p>
<p>▲Tough Battle in the Third Set: Lin lost the first set 4-6, and his situation worsened in the second set, seeming unsustainable. His shots lacked assurance, allowing Qiu to control everything. Lin lost five consecutive games, managing to win only one, preventing a complete rout. The crucial moment was the third set. If Qiu won it, he would win the match. If Lin won it, he could still recover. Lin used his exceptional intelligence to volley aggressively, leading 3-1, 4-2, boosting his momentum. However, both players were exhausted. Qiu fought with all his might, tying the score at 4-4, then taking the lead 5-4. Lin's fate rested on this tenth game. Fortunately, it was Lin's serve. Dusk was approaching, and the autumn wind was biting. Like a pendulum swinging, they fought for the final few games. 6-6, 7-7, 8-8, 9-9, each server won their serve. Ultimately, Qiu's stamina gave way, and Lin won back the third set 11-9, securing a lifeline.</p>
<p>▲Outcome Still Uncertain: As darkness fell, the referee announced a suspension of the match. The resumption date would be discussed today and announced tomorrow. The outcome is still uncertain. After regaining strength, Qiu has more opportunities, but Lin might be able to change the situation. Lin's performance has improved since last year, with his drives being more impressive, though he rarely wins points with them. His slice shots and volleys are frequently effective. His biggest weakness is his inability to hold on to leads during crucial moments. Qiu Feihai remains unchanged, sticking to his old style of quiet, steady baseline play, occasionally using beautiful drop shots. Who will win remains to be seen.</p>
<p>▲Chen Jiaqiu Opens the Scoring: In the second half, the Easy Gate team reorganized. Cao Qiuting, the right winger of the East China team, was replaced by Yu Tian, and Chen Hongguang filled the center forward position, significantly changing the situation. About seven or eight minutes into the game, Chen Hongguang received a pass from the back and lofted it to the right. Chen Jiaqiu, seeing the ball, hooked it in the direction of momentum towards the corner of the goal. The West team goalkeeper tried to dive and save it, but the ball had already passed over his head into the goal. East China thus opened the scoring, and cheers echoed far and wide.</p>
<p>▲Chen Hongguang Breaks Through Alone: After East China scored, their momentum increased. Two or three minutes later, Li Yichen scored a goal, but it was disallowed due to offside. About twenty minutes in, the West team was pressing into East China's territory. Their inner defense was stationed at the center line. Unexpectedly, East China's inner defense passed the ball out, past the West team's inner defense. Chen Hongguang saw the opportunity and charged forward, alone, bravely advancing towards the West team's goal. Their inner defense was unable to catch up. Chen Hongguang reached the goal and kicked the ball in, giving East China a two-goal lead.</p>
<p>▲Chen Jiaqiu Scores Again from Afar: At this time, East China's team appeared majestic, seemingly invincible. Although the West team attempted counterattacks, hoping to salvage the situation, the defensive efforts of Li and Guan were solid, and the forwards effectively controlled the game, preventing the West team's forwards from penetrating deep. Later, East China's forces advanced again, and the West team's internal defense became tense. Remembering their earlier mistake, they tightened their defense, making it difficult for East China to penetrate. Chen Jiaqiu, with a powerful long shot, scored another goal, resulting in a 3-0 victory for East China.</p>
<h3>Fundraiser for Northeastern Volunteer Army Ping Pong Tournament</h3>
<p>▲Champion: Chen Zhensheng... Runner-up: Guo Yuxiong</p>
<p>The Hongzhang Ping Pong Team initiated a fundraiser for the Northeastern Volunteer Army through a West Shanghai Ping Pong Tournament. Over a hundred yuan in tickets were sold, and upon collection, a representative will be sent to the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association. A total of ten teams participated in this tournament, using a knockout system. From the preliminary rounds to the semi-finals, the matches between Chen Linsheng of Hongle (Group A) and Chen Zhensheng of Hongzhang were the most exciting. Linsheng lacked stamina and lost 1-3. In Group B, the skills of Xu Menghui of Hongle and Guo Yuxiong of Hongzhang were highly praised by the audience. Guo won 3-2. In the final match between Group A and B, Guo and Chen competed. Chen won the championship with a score of 3-1, with Guo taking runner-up. After the tournament, the Hongzhang team provided refreshments, and the engineer Wang from Hongzhang Textile Mill presented the awards.</p>

<h3>Nanxiang Sports Association Reorganizes</h3>
<p>The Nanxiang Sports Association has been established for over seven years and is a well-established sports organization in Jiading. It regularly invites Shanghai teams for matches in football and basketball, having repeatedly defeated strong opponents and achieving temporary dominance. Unfortunately, since the Northeast Incident last autumn, followed by the tragic January 28th Incident in Shanghai, Nanxiang, being in the war zone, resulted in the dispersal of team members, causing the association's activities to stall for a long time. Now that the football season is approaching, the association's president, Mr. Zhou Riyi, and secretary-general, Mr. Qian Yilian, are actively reorganizing and planning a revival. A general meeting will be held soon. It is heard that the association's football team, in order to improve its skills, has decided to join the Chinese Football Association this autumn. Team members such as Jin Shujun, Tang Kezhong, Chen Shuyu, Chen Zhao, and Jin Dianding are all veterans on the field. If so, the Chinese Association will have another member this year.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Gold Price Fluctuations and Swings Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, the gold price situation continued to show a slightly upward trend with complex movements, seeming to form a cyclical pattern with calm fluctuations. Daily highs and lows varied by no more than seven or eight taels. Starting at 728.3 taels at the beginning of the week, it immediately rose by 1.1 taels, due to the continued decline in the silver market. Later, it exceeded the 730 tael mark. Although silver prices rebounded, the Shanghai exchange rate market was soft and then strengthened. Major players and short sellers rushed to cover their positions, causing prices to surge, reaching a new high after the swap, reaching 734.4 taels. Later, due to differing conditions abroad, even though large firms reduced their positions, US stocks and cotton surged, causing confusion. The exchange rates of both the UK and the US softened. The Guangdong bank Yifeng, along with major long positions, tended to liquidate, suddenly causing a rebound, returning to 720 taels. On Thursday, a new price of 715 taels was seen. Afterwards, it hovered around 30 taels, fluctuating and swinging, making it difficult to act. Industry players were uncertain. Finally, news broke that Mexico planned to purchase cash and use the gold standard. Active buying from various firms made many optimistic, suddenly advancing and breaking out of the 30-tael mark again, ending at 30.08 taels. Compared with the previous weekend, it rose again by 3.6 taels, having risen for four consecutive weeks, a total of about 47-48 taels. The total high and low prices for the week were 19.4 taels (the difference between the opening and closing prices plus 2.5 taels). The near and distant futures of the overseas silver market and Shanghai exchange rates diverged slightly. British silver was even, US silver slightly decreased, and exchange rates continued to fall. The British exchange rate against the US decreased by 0.075, and the US exchange rate against the British decreased by 0.010625. The shilling and US dollar listing prices were increased by half a point, but the actual transaction prices were different from what's apparent, with a decrease of 0.00625. During this week's trading, Chinese merchant gold businesses sold more and closed less, with some hedging, mostly settling at the listed price, initially pressing above 70 taels, then around 60 taels, and then back to 70 taels. According to investigations, firms such as Dalian, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, and Yuanxingyong still held long positions, while the short positions of Guangdong's Hengxing were not large. Yifeng had previously switched to a long position and had already exited the market yesterday. Yuanmaoyong and others still held short positions. The swap from October to November was swapped over 8 taels at the beginning of the week, then only 6 taels. It is said that there are still 3,000 contracts that have not been properly swapped. The number of November contracts is less than before, about 24,000 contracts. The spot red contracts are priced at the gold price plus 15-16 taels. The central bank is still continuously absorbing the current gold price. The high and low prices of the British and American silver markets and exchange rates are listed below:</p>

<h3>Interbank Overnight Loans Expensive and Silver Loans Cheap</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to it being Sunday, banks were closed, so trading was quiet. Besides the money houses opening to conduct market price point, there was little new trading worthy of recording. The overnight loan rate was 6 qian 9 fen 5 li and a half hao at the early market and 6 qian 9 fen 5 li 8 hao and 7 hu and a half at the afternoon market. Although the final number was slightly lower than before, the afternoon market between the two markets rose by 0.375 points, making the transaction volume limited to exchange draft money. 260,000 in the early market and 221,000 in the afternoon market. Only 10,000 in the early market were banknotes. Due to excessive silver supplies, silver overnight loans were all free of charge in both markets. Money houses' foreign public notes received over 4.4 million. Silver public notes received over 23 million. Remittances from various routes were over 400,000. Small money house transactions were over 300,000. The auxiliary coin market saw Jiangnan small silver at 6 qian 0 li and 4 hao at the early market, and 6 qian 0 li 3 hao and 7 hu and a half at the afternoon market. Trading was 3,000 jiao in the early market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver was 5 qian 8 fen and 8 li at the early market, and 5 qian 8 fen and 9 li at the afternoon market.

Trading was over 49,000 strings, amounting to 11,200 taels of silver.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Rose by 70-80 Cents Last Week</h3>
<p>▲Trend Stable with Peaceful Fluctuations</p>
<p>▲Trading Reached 17.5 Million</p>
<p>During the week (from the 19th to the 24th), the situation in the local bond market saw extremely rare spot trading each day, totaling only 25,000 yuan for the whole week. However, the futures market far surpassed the previous week, with market sentiment generally active and the market showing slight signs of improvement. Examining the daily trading of various bonds, Tuesday was the quietest day, with only 1.9 million yuan traded. Monday and Friday each saw 2.34 million yuan traded, while the remaining days were better, each reaching 3.67 million yuan. The total trading volume for the week was 17.505 million yuan, exceeding the previous week by over 11.1 million yuan. Not only did this month's futures far exceed the previous, accounting for over 11.1 million yuan, but the October futures also reached 6.4 million yuan. Salt tax and demobilization bonds saw the most trading, with salt tax bonds accounting for 2.275 million yuan in September futures and 1.9 million yuan in October futures. Demobilization bonds accounted for 2.1 million yuan in September futures and 1.26 million yuan in October futures. Unified tax and the '20 Customs Bonds' followed.

The '96 Public Bonds' saw 20,000 yuan traded, and the Financial Bonds saw 5,000 yuan traded. Although the domestic situation and diplomatic relations were in a dull state, market sentiment was slightly better, with a calm environment. Small investors bought in, and many short sellers covered their positions. In addition, with the end of the month approaching and settlement around the corner, swap transactions were active, causing demand to exceed supply. Prices for various bonds generally rose, resulting in increases of 30-40 cents to 70-80 cents, except for the '6' bonds and the '19 Customs Bonds' spot and the '20 Customs Bonds' and '19 Customs Bonds' September futures, which each rose by about one yuan. Only '96 Financial Bonds' saw a slight decrease. The bond market's situation, though slightly better than before, is not expected to develop in the short term.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Surged Mid-Week</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market showed signs of wavering at the beginning of the week, as American cotton broke through the 7-cent mark and rumors circulated that large long positions were being liquidated. General short positions took advantage of this, aggressively selling, breaking through the 148-tael line. At this time, the atmosphere was negative, and sellers seemed dominant. Unexpectedly, on Thursday, American cotton suddenly surged by 50-60 points, like a bolt from the blue. Sellers were greatly disappointed, and general small investors showed panic, eagerly covering their positions, causing prices to surge by over three taels. This situation was entirely due to the underlying fundamentals and the depletion of local yarn inventory in Shanghai. With any positive news, short positions panicked, which is understandable given the large number of uncovered short positions. However, on Friday, American cotton fell again, and prices fell back within the 50-tael mark, calming the market. Actual sales among merchant groups still lacked significant development, so short sellers remained stable. The future depends on the development of actual sales. The total volume of spot yarn purchased by various parties during the week was 6,507 bales, similar to the previous week. The total trading volume of standard yarn during the week was 193,600 bales, with prices for each month rising by 1-2.5 qian compared to the previous week. The volume purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Group      Bale Volume  Group      Bale Volume</p>
<p>Inland    1,375          Ningbo    105</p>

<h3>Last Week's Cotton Market: Easy to Decline, Difficult to Rise</h3>
<p>In the past week, the cotton market reached a new low, approaching 31 taels. This was because American cotton broke the 7-cent barrier, and the domestic climate was favorable for the new cotton crop to enter the market. News of abundant supplies arriving from various sources spread, so a certain manufacturer actively sold off their holdings, increasing short positions. Their volume was estimated to be over 200,000 dan, making their position quite strong. For a time, they suppressed the market. It was found that the Yong'an factory alone bought 60,000 to 70,000 dan, while other buyers only bought 20,000 to 30,000 dan. The power of the buyers was insufficient to resist the downward trend, so it was easy to fall and difficult to rise. On Wednesday, there was talk that the market would cross the 31-tael mark, but unexpectedly, on Thursday, American cotton rose sharply by 50 to 60 points. Many small investors showed signs of anxiety and covered their short positions, causing the market to jump by more than one tael. Although American cotton rose, it should not have caused such panic. The real reason was that there were too many floating short positions, and once good news came, it was difficult to control the situation. On Friday, American cotton fell again, and the market also turned downward, falling back within the 32-tael range. The cotton market is currently in a period of new supply, and its impact will continue to be significant. The total transaction volume of standard cotton for the entire week was 597,900 dan. Prices for each month fell by 4, 5, and 6 qian compared to the previous week. The source of goods at the wharves included 12,684 bales of Yao cotton and 4,300 bales of Tong cotton. American cotton prices rose by 65 points compared to the previous week. The prices and bale amounts of raw cotton purchased by various manufacturers are listed below:</p>

<h3>American Cotton Recovers Slightly, English and Indian Cotton Continue to Weaken</h3>

<h3>Women Cutting Their Hair and Patriotism</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, women who have cut their hair are so extravagant and enchanting, even more so than women who have not cut their hair! The cost of a single curled hairstyle is not surprisingly dozens of dollars; before cutting their hair, even hiring a hair-dressing maid wouldn't cost that much.</p>
<p>The most famous hair-cutter in history is undoubtedly Tao Mu, who cut her hair to entertain guests.</p>
<p>To encourage her son's studies, she sold her hair to buy rice, using the money to support her son's scholarly pursuits; her son was Tao Kan, who became an important figure of his time. She cultivated her son's learning to save the country, and her cutting her hair was an act of patriotism.</p>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, a Japanese widow, Mrs. Ujiie Naoko, advocated cutting hair to save the country. She gathered many comrades and made naval ropes from the long hair cut from the heads of ten thousand women to encourage their husbands or sons to fight bravely. Their cutting their hair was an act of patriotism.</p>
<p>The women of Siam cut their hair in unison across the country: it is said that the reason for cutting their hair was that many soldiers had sacrificed their lives in the war with Burma in the past. The Burmese troops pressed closer and closer, even surrounding the capital very tightly. The women of the city were both sad and angry, and immediately cut their hair and became soldiers to defend the city. Later, they defeated the Burmese troops and lifted the siege. The women adopted this practice as a custom, and have shaved their heads ever since. Their cutting their hair was also an act of patriotism.</p>
<p>I want to ask the modern ladies, modern grandmothers, and modern girls:</p>
<p>What is the purpose of you female bodhisattvas cutting off your dark cloud hair, and what example are you setting?</p>
<p>Is it to cultivate your sons to achieve academic success so that they can work hard to save the country?</p>
<p>Is it to make naval ropes to supply the navy to wipe out the shame of the September 18th Incident?</p>
<p>Is it to join the army, work hard to defend the city, and prepare to defeat the enemy?</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Scientists</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>My Speculation</p>
<p>When I was little, I was very fond of scientists! I remember when I was in elementary school ten years ago, a student magazine printed many photographs of scientists. I looked at them carefully for a full hour, and then I looked at myself carefully in the mirror. Finally, I asked my aunt: (Do I look like anyone on this page?) My aunt said: (Everyone looks like you!) (Haha!) I laughed for a while. Thinking about it now, this page was full of extremely famous American engineers and scientists, like Edison, Steinmetz, Wright, etc. Not to mention whether I look like one ten-thousandth of them, I'm afraid even their servants don't look as good as them.</p>
<p>However, according to my current observations and speculations, scientists not only have special appearances, but also seem to have special temperaments. What special temperaments? Roughly as follows:</p>
<p>First, scientists are simple. They work hard for mankind, but they themselves are very simple. For example, Steinmetz only needed cigars and small animals. Famous figures in the Chinese scientific community also mostly wear coarse cloth clothes.</p>
<p>Second, scientists are honest. They have no cunning thoughts. Their hearts are as clean as children's. Cunning, deceit, exploitation, and slyness are only known to politicians.</p>
<p>Third, scientists are extremely hardworking. Otherwise, how could they complete those great scientific works? Edison could stay awake for several days and nights, which is world-famous.</p>
<p>Fourth, scientists are extremely calm. Their work requires them to exhaust their minds and devote themselves to it. Therefore, their hearts are exceptionally calm (Mount Tai collapses in front of them, but their expressions do not change; a moose appears on the left, but their eyes do not blink.) Scientists do have this attitude. If the reader does not believe it, they may ask a famous scholar, and they will definitely see how calm he is!</p>
<p>What China lacks is not foreign Ph.D.s, but (genuine) (Chinese-style) (Chinese engineers and scientists). If China's (domestic) engineers and scientists were as numerous as (politicians), China would have already been sitting in the top spot in the world!</p>
<h3>Witty Remarks</h3>
<p>— ·Ti· Gong</p>
<p>After a certain official died, he vehemently complained in the Yama Palace. Yama asked him the reason in surprise. The official said: (This official has always been physically strong. Recently, at home, I still played sixteen rounds of mahjong every day. Why was I so confused and suddenly arrested?) Yama sneered and said: (Originally, your lifespan in the world had not ended, and you had much to do. Who told you, you evil creature, as soon as you became an official, you drank your concubine's foot-washing water, specializing in fighting for favor and jealousy, throwing away your official hat in a fit of anger, crying and hanging yourself to feign illness. In total, you served as an official for three years, but you fell ill ninety-eight times. This palace has shown you extra grace, intending to fulfill you, to save you from continuing to harm the people and mislead the country in the mortal world.)</p>
<p>The young master of a coal shop asked his father: (What kind of patriotic heart did you post in the newspaper, daring not to lag behind others? So why don't you go to the Northeast to fight the enemy?) His father smiled and said, (Silly child, don't you even understand this? When I say "patriotic heart, daring not to lag behind others," it means "love for my family, daring not to treat myself poorly." They are fighting their battles, loving their country, and I am buying my black goods, loving my family. Wouldn't it be too impolite if my patriotic heart were thicker than theirs?) The young master suddenly realized: (No wonder I see these eight characters in the newspaper every day. So that's how it's explained.)</p>
<h3>Being an Official and Seeking Love</h3>
<p>— ·Jiang· Jie· Ru</p>
<p>The Two Matters are of a Similar Nature</p>
<p>Being an official and seeking love are similar in nature. The first point of similarity is that both require (money).</p>
<p>The second point of similarity is (status).</p>
<p>Although being an official relies on scheming, it cannot be separated from status. With a certain status, one can then scheme for a certain official position. If a small clerk suddenly wanted to run for the position of provincial governor, not only would it be impossible, it would simply be the laughingstock of the world!</p>
<p>Although there have been (meteoric rises) in history, this is already a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Similarly, looking for love also requires considering status. A rickshaw puller would never (attack) a female professor: if an apprentice in a opium shop suddenly had a dream of (marrying the queen of the university), that would truly be a strange phenomenon in psychology. This strange phenomenon can be used as a reference for psychologists to study (strange dreams).</p>

<p>— ·Qing· Ping</p>
<p>Light Makeup and Heavy Makeup Just Cycle</p>
<p>Now, modern girls who love beauty all like to draw their eyebrows dark and long, smear their lips blood-red, and paint their faces snow-white. Heavy makeup is so beautiful that it can be called the extreme!</p>
<p>We recall more than ten years ago, when female students from girls' schools in prosperous cities came out with their makeup washed off, full of natural charm. People praised their natural beauty. Therefore, grandmothers and young ladies who had not yet entered school also admired them very much. So they disliked the color of脂粉 and competed to wear light makeup. At that time, only some middle-aged women and prostitutes engaged in flesh and blood careers were still applying thick脂粉, smearing thick powder, and drawing black eyebrows. When we saw them, we thought they were strange and couldn't help but laugh at them as妖精. At this time, the beauty of modern girls was to admire the natural beauty of light makeup!</p>
<p>Ah! The transformation of fashion is really unthinkable. In the past three or four years, modern girls who love beauty and are good at dressing up have become tired of light makeup and love to apply脂粉, powder and draw eyebrows. This is another transformation of women's beauty!</p>
<p>They are racking their brains and changing and innovating at any time in terms of beauty. It is possible that in the near future,</p>
<p>They will abandon the heavy makeup and return to the light makeup. Oh, turning back and forth, whether it is heavy or light, it is nothing but a cycle?</p>

<h3>The Club of the Silver Threads (24)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>(12)</p>
<p>Everyone was clamoring, and Zhu Bofang was suddenly startled and fell from the ladder, while Yuan the Mad laughed strangely and jumped down from above into the crowd.</p>
<p>The county magistrate and the chief of public security were furious and immediately ordered the police to arrest Yuan the Mad and prepare to punish him severely.</p>
<p>At this moment, Regiment Commander Yuan was also stunned. He looked closely and recognized that this was his wife whom he had abandoned before. He hesitated whether to let the crowd deal with her or announce to the public that they were not allowed to scold or beat her? But in that instant, Yuan the Mad had jumped to the ground, falling and breaking her head and bleeding. The crowd was very angry that she had disrupted the order of the solemn ceremony. They wanted to surround her and beat her fiercely.</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Yuan shouted loudly from the stage very quickly: (Everyone, don't use violence!) While shouting, he also jumped off the stage and used his strength to squeeze through the crowd, picked up Yuan the Mad, and shouted: (Don't make things difficult for her. No one is allowed to bully her!)</p>
<p>The county magistrate and the chief of public security on the stage were confused. They only scolded Zhu Bofang for being muddleheaded in his work. How could he not check carefully and let that mad woman use the ladder to climb behind the screen wall to the monument to disrupt the venue?</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Yuan, holding his wife, had already walked to the stage. Zhu Qilan, her face pale, said to Regiment Commander Yuan in a trembling voice: (This mad woman is so hateful. Commander, let her go and let the police arrest her and detain her!) She took out her embroidered silk handkerchief and wiped the blood stains on the sleeves of the commander's clothes. She did not pay any attention to how her father fell from the ladder.</p>
<p>The order of the meeting place was completely gone. Like a tide, they all squeezed to the front of the stage to watch. Some were still scolding the mad woman, advocating that she be beaten to death; some were praising the commander's kindness; some were laughing at Zhu Qilan for fawning on the commander, simply shameless; and some people were shouting: (Zhu Qilan! If you kowtow to the commander three times, you will also be able to hold him). The police had lost the ability to maintain order. The county magistrate and the chief of public security only looked at each other, losing their dignity.</p>
<p>Although Zhu Bofang fell from the ladder, he was not badly injured. He still limped to the stage and stood in front of the commander to bow, not daring to say a word, his face as white as a dead person.</p>
<p>(Quiet! Everyone, don't make a sound!) Regiment Commander Yuan shouted, which was more powerful than dozens of policemen. The crowd at the venue immediately quieted down.</p>
<p>(This is my wife who has been separated for more than ten years. I have been looking for her but could not find her. Thank you all for building a monument for me, giving me the opportunity to meet her. I am really lucky). Regiment Commander Yuan announced to the crowd, and the whole body clapped loudly.</p>
<p>(In the past, I abandoned my family because I secretly went to join the army. I didn't expect my wife to go crazy for me: but she is still alive. I have to thank you all for taking care of her in the town.) Regiment Commander Yuan continued to report excitedly, but the people who usually scolded her and wanted to beat her felt very uneasy and secretly slipped away.</p>
<p>(Are there any good doctors here?) Regiment Commander Yuan asked the public.</p>
<p>(Where is Dr. Zhang? Where is Dr. Tang?) The group was looking for the only doctor of medicine in the town.</p>

<h3>Dying to Save Face</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>When a person is acting lawlessly and doing evil, their mind is completely tense and the situation is exciting. If they reach the point of being full of evil and cannot escape the law, then they will know repentance and feel that they should not have done it. However, calling out (Uncle) is useless.</p>
<p>According to reports yesterday, the kidnapper Chen Huiqing from Yancheng confessed before his execution, I was fooled by bad friends and committed this unfilial, unrighteous, unkind, and unjust thing. I am very ashamed to be shot today. I ask the judge not to publish it in the newspaper. Chen Huiqing did not know仁義 or understand shame when he was a kidnapper. When he was about to be executed, his conscience began to discover. As the saying goes, (When a bird is about to die, its cry is sad, and when a person is about to die, their words are kind.) When he was a kidnapper, he did not care about saving face at all. When he was about to be executed, he asked the judge not to publish it in the newspaper. It is really dying to save face.</p>
<p>Is human nature inherently good? Inherently evil? A mixture of good and evil? Or capable of both good and evil? This question has been discussed by many scholars, but it is still an unsolved case. If we look at Chen Huiqing, human nature is still mostly good. The various evils in Shanghai are more than in any other place. It can be seen that it is entirely caused by the environment and not by innate evil. In the past</p>
<p>They said (It is not easy to live in Chang'an) I now say (It is not easy to live in Shanghai) If you lose your foothold, you will inevitably</p>

<p>turn (One slip becomes an eternal regret).</p>
<p>Chen Huiqing also said, (Our country's national power is declining. I hope the Chinese people will love their country and fight hard), etc. Please think about it, a heinous kidnapper still knows how to love his country and still knows how to persuade people to fight hard. Now, in the current situation in our country, there are still many people who do not know how to love their country and do not know how to fight hard. Even if they say (love the country) (resist) but do things that are completely unpatriotic and unresisting, there are also many such people. Such people are not even as good as kidnappers.</p>

<p>I wake up from a dream in a solitary hostel at three o'clock in the morning, listening to the sad and desolate sounds with deep feeling. The four walls are filled with the faint chirping of insects in the fragrant grass, and a lamp chats idly in a bean flower shed. The clear sky is full of moonlight, like a painting. With unrestrained elegance, the insect flaps its wings and sings. Year after year, it lives under someone else's eaves, not fighting for fame or profit, but only fighting for sound.</p>

<h3>Talk About Air Conditioning Equipment · Ting · Ruo · Ke · Pei</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The other day, this column published an article by a certain gentleman (The Latest Air Conditioning Equipment); the words are short and the words are omitted, making it difficult to understand. Now, take some time to choose the essentials and supplement them as follows:</p>
<p>Check the air conditioner, (also known as the heat collector:) that is, by means of mechanical force, the heat from one place is moved to another place, so that people in the room do not feel the effects of the hot climate at all; it is really a wonderful tool for cooling off in the summer.</p>
<p>There are four types of air conditioning equipment: (1) Compression. (2) Absorption type, (3) Cold air type, (4) Vacuum type. Most of the equipment installed in European and American countries is the first type and the second type, that is, for the homes in Shanghai that have already installed air conditioners, such as HSBC Bank, HSBC Building, Huamao Hotel, Nanjing Grand Theater, etc., all use the compression type or the absorption type. As for the third type, the efficiency is low, but it is occasionally used in ships. The latest vacuum type cited by a certain gentleman (ie the fourth type,) is no longer used by most air-conditioning engineers because of the high installation cost and low efficiency.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of fluid, if it is worth gasification, it must absorb a lot of heat. This kind of heat is called (latent heat). All those who have read elementary physics know it, so if a certain easy-to-vaporize liquid is used to continue to vaporize in the place where heat is to be collected, all the heat in that area will be absorbed; and at the same time, the temperature will also be reduced. The vaporized substance is introduced into the compression chamber and compressed. At this time, the gas generates a lot of heat due to the large pressure; then it is led to the condenser, and cold water is used to absorb its heat, and the temperature drops and then condenses into a liquid; this cycle is endless, relying on a small amount of liquid substance, so that it can be used inexhaustibly.</p>
<p>There are many types of easy-to-vaporize liquids, and there are four types that can be used practically: (1) Ammonia, (2) Carbon Dioxide, (3) Sulfur Dioxide, (4) Chloromethane. Large-scale heat collectors all use ammonia as a transmission medium; carbon dioxide is suitable for places where the temperature is extremely low: as for the third and fourth types, they are suitable for small-scale heat collection devices; it is beneficial that there is no need to apply high pressure; it is also safer to use.</p>
<p>If we want to install a perfect air-conditioning equipment, we must pay attention to three elements: first, reduce the air temperature; second, the air must flow; and third, the moisture content in the air must be reduced. If any one of these items has a defect, then people in the air-conditioned space will immediately feel uncomfortable. (But pay)</p>

<h3>Concerning Remarriage for Widowers and Widows</h3>
<p>— Shi Na</p>
<p>After Mr. Yiping raised the issue of remarriage at this association, I very much wanted to express some of my humble opinions. However, because I was very busy, it took me a few days before I could put pen to paper.</p>
<p>There is no problem with a widower remarrying. As long as he has some money, no one will criticize him even if he marries seventeen or eighteen times. Generally, society will tacitly acknowledge it as his right. Only the remarriage of a widow becomes an issue. If a woman marries seventeen or eighteen times in succession, she becomes a big joke. Generally, society will despise and look down upon her. What a contradictory mentality! Men can remarry, and women should naturally also be able to remarry. This is a matter of course and principle. What is the difference?</p>
<p>Speaking of widows today, they can be divided into two types: one type wants to remarry but cannot, and the other does not want to remarry but is forced to. Wanting to marry or not wanting to remarry is originally a matter of personal freedom; in other words, it is an (inalienable right) that everyone should have. But Chinese women, for thousands of years, have been heavily bound by the Three Obediences and Four Virtues, and all their rights have long been eroded by the Confucian scholars. Once there is a widow, whether she wants to remarry, she remarries; if she doesn't want to remarry, she doesn't remarry. It is not that easy anymore. Moreover, the issue of remarriage is one of the issues of women's rights. Only after women's rights issues are completely resolved will remarriage no longer be an issue. Furthermore, women's issues are the personal issues of women themselves. Women's personal issues should be resolved by women themselves, in order to be truly resolved, and in order to be thoroughly resolved. Most of today's women not only cannot rise up to resolve them, but also do not even know to rise up to resolve them. Therefore, the important work that we should be doing now is still to make women aware of rising up to resolve their own problems. When women know how to rise up to resolve their own pressing problems, she will remarry if she wants to remarry, she will remain a widow if she wants to remain a widow. Moreover, if she wants to marry Zhang San, she will marry Zhang San; if she wants to marry Li Si, she will marry Li Si; no one can interfere, and no one is qualified to interfere.</p>
<p>We naturally hope that this phenomenon can be realized in the near future. But we can do some emergency work now. For example, if there is a widow who very much wants to remarry but cannot, we should guide her, guide her to the Women's Association to seek help, guide her to the Women's Relief Association to find a solution; we should also encourage her, promote her awakening, and urge her to strive for her own legitimate happiness.</p>
<p>If there is such a woman among my neighbors, I would be very willing to do so. I think Mr. Yiping and insightful readers would also be very willing to fulfill this obligation!</p>

<h3>Connected Card Sharping</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>After being away from Shanghai for three months, I have come back for a short stay. Running on the streets and looking around, the banners of "Great Bargains" are flying everywhere, and men and women in colorful attire are constantly carrying seven or eight packages under their arms, coming out of various large stores in droves, like a tide. The dazzling motorcycle taxis, with their headlights lit up with snobbish expressions, like the eyes of living tigers, shuttle back and forth endlessly. Red, yellow, blue, white, and black heads (the color of the hats) are squeezed up and down, looking like maggots. There is no moment of dispersal. Alas! Who can tell that this was once a war zone that had suffered the cruel devastation of the enemy not long ago? Alas! Who can tell that these are people carrying the weight of national disaster on their backs, with national subjugation imminent? Judging from this state, it is simply a world of peace and prosperity, a carefree world.</p>
<p>After eating dinner, because the task that I should do upon arriving in Shanghai has been completed, I sat in the hotel and felt stifled. Watching a play, going to the amusement park, and meeting with XX, are not things I enjoy. So, I had to wander around the streets, looking at the colorful displays in the glass windows of the shops on both sides, feasting my eyes. I asked my companion, Mr. You, who also agreed to stroll around this free, economical, and expanded amusement park. So, the two of us ran out of the hotel, aimlessly walking east and strolling west.</p>
<p>Walking leisurely, we unknowingly reached Nanjing Road, the most magnificent street in Shanghai, and also the most prosperous in all of China. The two of us stood on the cement pavement, looking at the shop windows all the way. Sometimes, when we saw the expensive items with many digits on the price tags, we both stuck out our tongues and shook our heads, fully revealing the stingy state of poor country bumpkins.</p>
<p>(Excuse me, sir, how do I get to XX Road?) A man who looked like a businessman asked Mr. You for directions. (Just turn the corner!) Mr. You pointed to a cross street on the left with his right hand and replied.</p>
<p>(Thank you) The man got the direction and walked away with big strides.</p>
<p>In an instant, Mr. You suddenly shouted, (Oh no, what bad luck, my wallet is gone!) I heard it and immediately asked him when he lost it. He said that just when he stepped onto the cement pavement, he was still holding it tightly outside his long gown pocket with his hand. Only now, because he answered the man's question and pointed out the direction to him, did he have to loosen his hand, and then he realized it was gone. But when the man was asking for directions, he was standing in front of me, so it definitely wasn't him who pried it open. Don't accuse him wrongly.</p>
<p>Back at the hotel, I thought to myself that the man who asked for directions was, after all, highly suspicious. Later, I figured it out: the man who asked for directions and the pickpocket must be connected card sharpers. Seeing that Mr. You's long gown pocket was bulging, they knew that there was a lot of "dala si" (money) inside. But he was using five "cai tong zi" (child-like protectors of wealth), guarding it, making it difficult for them to cross the line. So, they used a clever trick of diverting the tiger from the mountain. One person pretended to ask for directions, waiting for you to loosen your hand, and then the one behind would take advantage of the opportunity. Just think about it, XX Road is right in front of him, how could he not know? Moreover, he wanted you to raise your right hand, so he specifically asked you for directions to the left. Isn't this their whole set of connected card sharping tricks? Mr. You listened and couldn't help but jump up, saying repeatedly, (That's right, that's right).</p>
<p>Nonsense</p>
<h3>Mr. Shi's Gambling</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Mr. Shi has been playing mahjong almost every day recently. This is something he never did before. He thought to himself: (Why do I like playing mahjong so much? Didn't I absolutely never play mahjong before? Oh, the temptation of gambling is really great!) This was the only conclusion he came to.</p>
<p>But what Mr. Shi found most annoying was that he always lost every time he played mahjong. One loss, two losses, three losses, four losses... still losses. So, when he tallied up, he had lost more than twenty yuan in the past week. Although this is not a very large sum, it is a very large sum for him, who only has an income of fifty or sixty yuan a month. Even if he only settles at the end of the month, and there is still hope of winning later, this hope is ultimately not very guaranteed.</p>
<p>When he was lying in bed at midnight, he thought silently:</p>
<p>(Oh! I lost more than five yuan again today, my luck is really bad! But that all-terminals straight three-fan hand was indeed played wrong; I had already punged four and was ready to go out, and everyone knew I was doing terminals, and I still had a pair of three terminals and a single two terminal in my hand, so I could go out with either a one or four terminal or a two terminal single wait. So, I shouldn't have konged when the person across from me discarded a three terminal. But I konged it for the one-fan added to the kong on flowers. Then everyone didn't discard any terminals, and I drew a four terminal... A four-fan hand never came out. What a pity! Otherwise, five hundred for a full hand, and I was also the dealer, three times five is fifteen, that's fifteen thousand in one go.... Oh, I'm no good at playing mahjong, I'm too amateur. I'll never play again, not playing means there's no way to lose.... But what if I don't play? Don't I want to win back what I lost? Am I willing to give them these twenty-odd old coins?...)</p>
<p>So, this made him very embarrassed. Red Dragon pung, Green Dragon kong, all he could see was mahjong. All one suit, three big dragons double and triple with three kongs and East Wind two fans.... If I could draw like that in my mind, would I still be afraid of winning money? Moreover, he only had a few dollars that were barely enough to use, where would he get extra money to pay the mahjong debt?</p>
<p>The next day, he spent a whole morning thinking of the most ingenious method, which was to specialize in doing no honors simple hand. This two-fan hand is relatively easy and others won't notice. With a 40 limit, drawing this is 160, how easy! He considered this simply (mahjong philosophy).</p>
<p>In this way, he indeed won back a lot of what he had lost, but people are always greedy, especially in a capitalist society; win and still want to win, so he played a few more times, and he lost again, and even more than before. So, he began to feel helpless.</p>
<p>Today I met him with a dejected look on his face, I subconsciously asked him, and he told me about his recent experiences; so I comforted him and said:</p>
<p>(Friend! Playing mahjong is ultimately a game for wealthy old men and ladies, they have plenty of money, winning or losing is no big deal. Are poor guys like us fit to play mahjong? What money do we have to play with? As soon as you enter the arena, you worry about losing, the more you worry about losing, the more you lose because that depends on your mental state. So, it's best not to play.)</p>
<p>(Yes, yes,...)</p>
<p>I saw him nodding constantly.</p>
