<h3 id="c1">軍事戰與外交戰翰 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>兩旬以來。我將士與民衆莫不集中全副精力於自衛的抵抗。方有生新氣象。而外交上則仍立於孤懸地位。且有日趨於暗淡失敗之虞。此則不能不責備政府當局之太不注意也。</p>
<p>昔法國拿破侖失敗後。搭列蘭任戰敗國之代表出席維也納會議。周旋於俄奥普英之際。從未受戰勝國之壓迫而屈服。近大戰後德國受創最重。而史脫萊斯孟與各國周旋。訂羅加諾安全與仲裁條約。撤列强在萊因这駐防加盟日内瓦。一躍而爲常任委員。土耳其爲近東之病夫。大單後對土和約。束縛最苛。卒賴凱末爾在軍事上極力抵抗。伊斯美在外交上堅苦折衝。而獲得土耳其獨立之洛桑條約。凡此皆足爲弱國外交之模範。亦軍事與外交必須兼顧並重之鐵證。</p>
<p>反觀吾國歷年來之外交當局。好大喜功。不務實際。對内則籍種種誇大之宣傳。以欺騙國民。對外則調遣私人。扶植已勢。舉凡一切毫無黨派臭味。</p>
<p>經騐鍜練之人才皆拼棄不用。而與已派有關係者。則無論爲科學文學家軍事家。均可銜國家之使命。充折衝之重任。甚至年輕浮囂之留學生。亦可主掌使館。列席國際。醜態百出騰笑萬方。以如斯之人才。而欲責其在外交上拘救我民族國家之危亡。其可得乎。</p>
<p>且也。一年以來。駐外使領。大都出缺未補。每由普通館員。兼充代辦日本對我之武力侵略。自发生八之役以迄一二八之變瞬息己五閱月。僅令施顏兩代表。相繼在日内瓦支撑掙　。當然有孤掌難鳴之苦。據查自去年七月以來。駐外使館館員都因生活費無着。有斷炊之虞。甚至郵電諸費。亦無法籌措。外交情形。急如薪火。而使館與祖國。消息隔絶。致令館員與僑胞。終日旁皇莫知所措。在此種外交情勢下。而欲求外交之勝利。其可得乎</p>
<p>况乎今日在國際情勢萬分緊張之際。日本正努力於違反事實之宣傳政</p>
<p>府當局於此。一須從速遣派富有經騐之外交官。切實整頓駐外使館之行政</p>
<p>二須速籌經費。充作駐外使館溝通消息之資。並爲外交上一切正當之用務使駐外使館之神經。由麻木而漸進於靈敏。應付之手段。亦自緩怠而趨於活潑。外交之給養有着。折衝乃有所措手。此軍事戰與外交戰。必須互想呼應之說也。</p>

<p>敵艦砲轟吳淞旋卽停止</p>
<p>江灣激戰我軍獲戰利品</p>
<p>閘北砲聲並非正式戰爭</p>
<p>敵軍戰略、已由閘北移至吳淞而江灣爲兩路之聯絡線故亦爲敵軍所重視、連日砲轟吳淞及昨日襲攻江灣、均爲其戰略之見端、而閘北砲聲不過爲其聲東擊西之威脅而已、我軍沈着應戰、抱敵來則攻之决心故敵軍砲火雖猛、均爲我軍所擊退也、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<h3 id="c3">吳淞昨日戰况 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>敵騎多名中伏覆没</p>
<p>昨晨敵艦攻獅子林</p>
<p>寳山民房略有損失</p>
<p>吳淞方面、於前日（十五）傍晚七時、許在薀藻浜南面、曾用大砲向我陸地攻擊、並有飛機數架、黑夜航空擲彈我軍我軍沉着應戰至昨晨二時許、敵軍復遣騎兵多名、由西唐家橋方面進犯、冀圖包抄我軍後方當中我軍伏兵、即被我軍殲滅、奪獲戰利品無算、又昨晨五時許、敵艦四艘在吳淞口外、向我獅子林砲台轟擊七十餘砲、並有飛機三架、在吳淞寳山一帶擲彈助戰、我軍竭力應戰約歷一小時之譜敵仍不得逞、茲將昨日戰况、及我軍奪獲之戰利品分别彙紀如下、</p>

<p>昨午之小接觸昨日七午自十一時許起、敵軍在薀藻浜南面·及南徐家灣一帶、用野砲六七尊、向浜北我軍陣地攻擊、約每十分鐘開一砲、我軍亦隨時還擊、故戰事並不十分激烈、但至下午四時許、尙未停止、又吳淞鎭自前日午時被敵軍飛機擲彈起火後、焚燒終夜、至昨日下午二時、猶未熄滅、</p>
<p>敵艦又攻砲台昨晨五時許、吳淞口外有日艦四艘、攻擊吳淞直北之獅子林砲臺、歷一小時許、共發砲七十餘響復有日機三架、由航空母艦上飛出至吳淞寳山月浦羅店等處抛擲炸彈、我軍毫無損失、惟民房被燬甚多、調查如次（吳淞）外馬路常熟花行、豐記米行、生泰米行、泰昌石子行、西安路頑子别墅、南昌路劉裕隆宅、須新順宅、淞興路八區黨部、和盛綢緞局等、均中彈燒燬、當砲火猛烈時、有保衛團排長須七英、冐險返家救父、在南昌路中砲彈、炸去兩腿慘斃、此外文昌路口亦有被炸斃之居民屍首十一名、（寳山）東門林憲吉宅·劉子球宅·南門吳蜀江宅·石皮街·宋庭三宅·草鞋浜陳寳多宅、均被燬、（羅店）朱恒昌米行·潘　嘉宅·中彈被燬、長浦橋朱亦宜宅前、落下一彈、炸斃行人一名、（月浦）東北陳姓家受砲、燬去樓房三幢、死一老嫗</p>

<p>敵軍之坦克車字林報云、日軍前日由運艦卸下輕坦克車六輛後、昨日（十四）又起岸裝甲堅厚之坦克車十輛、車上裝有發射迅速之輕砲機鎗等、此爲日軍第一次運滬之眞正坦克車、日軍第三批運輸船載運第九師團餘部及其他增援部隊、業已自本國開出、大約今日可到滬、</p>
<p>敵軍之司令部上海泰晤士報云、日本陸軍司令部現設楊樹浦公大紗廠、馬隊與步兵大隊則駐紥司令部附近、上海日本訪員者信日本尙有援軍來滬、據東京消息、日政府現正考慮續派援軍赴滬、故上海日軍總司令不久感可有戰士四萬人供其調遺云、</p>
<h3 id="c4">江灣路之激戰 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>擊斃　　人十餘名</p>
<p>並奪獲機關槍四挺</p>
<p>入晚砲聲全係威嚇</p>
<p>自日軍變更戰略後、傾全力猛攻吳淞、閘北方面、戰事遂較爲沉寂、昨晨拂曉、敵在靑雲路·八字橋·天通菴路·一帶、復以步槍機關槍·小鋼砲·向我方陣地射擊、我亦還擊、至九時許始止、至十二時、八字橋方面槍聲又起、敵方砲聲極密、雙方均係小接觸、我軍固守防地、沉着應戰、敵殊無機可乘、昨日下午四時、江灣路方面、敵約二百餘人、向我陣地衝進、我軍奮勇接戰結果斃敵八十餘名、奪獲機關槍四挺、敵狼狽潰退、入晚八時後、敵復以大砲向我轟擊、歷一時許始止、但至十時後砲聲又起、每分鐘發一二砲、至十二時又止、兩點後又陸續發砲、至三時半未止、全係威嚇性質、實際上雙方並無激戰、</p>
<h3 id="c5">敵機四處擲彈 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>

<p>因風向關係、有時可聞得極微機聲、昨日敵機八時飛起、在寳山及吳淞偵察完畢、九時許即轉至大塲顧家鎭一帶投彈、因防我高射砲轟擊、敵機均不敢低飛環繞至再、始下降擲落一彈、共擲落五六枚經我方以小鋼砲轟擊、乃即逃避迨至下午二、時又復重來、當在大塲投下一彈燬民房三間在顧家宅所投二彈、多落田梗中、並未損及房屋人畜云、</p>

<p>上海泰晤士報云、據美使詹森昨日（十五）聲稱、渠此次至滬、非欲以議和條件加於交戰雙方之任何方面、不過欲知上海大局之眞相耳、美使對於調查之所得、不發言論、惟復切實聲明、渠此行僅爲一種敎育的性質、但美使曾與其他數國公使作非正式之會商、且曾訪問美海軍陸戰隊與第三十一步兵大隊司令部、並巡閱美陸軍防守之陣線、美使赴京日期、雖未决定、惟聞有星期三四日乘驅逐艦首途之說、今日（十六）將受吳市長之宴待、昨日顧維鈞曾往謁見、聞皆無政治臭味云、</p>

<p>大統路尸體遍地記者與友人兩名、從滬西兜抄至閘北、此行目的、明知所居之永興路、在寳山路第一條火綫中、不易到家、亦明知所住華興里、已經全弄遭匪人刦掠、家内物件、决無存留、但爲欲一觀眞相、故不惜冒險一往、並非前去搬物也、我等仍在拂曉動身、迨至上午七時許、已到達滬北大統路、直到大統路底、街頭絶少行人、將至共和新路時見沿路兩旁尸體纍纍、以婦女與小孩爲多、均爲慘無人道之日飛機炸彈與大砲所擊斃者、因無法收殮、咸陳尸道上、用蘆蓆障蔽之、最使人深刻不忘者、有一尸體已被野犬食去其頭顱與手臂之一部、滿地殷紅、我入幾疑身人修羅塲矣、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Military Warfare and Diplomatic Warfare <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>For the past twenty days, our soldiers and civilians have been focusing all their energy on self-defense and resistance, showing a new spirit. However, diplomatically, we remain in an isolated position and face the risk of becoming increasingly bleak and failing. This cannot but be blamed on the government authorities for not paying enough attention.</p>
<p>In the past, after Napoleon's defeat, Talleyrand, as the representative of the defeated country, attended the Vienna Conference, negotiating with Russia, Austria, Prussia, and England, never succumbing to the pressure of the victorious countries. More recently, Germany suffered the most damage after the Great War, but Stresemann negotiated with various countries, signed the Locarno Treaties of Security and Arbitration, withdrew the stationed troops of the great powers in the Rhineland, and joined Geneva in one leap as a permanent member. Turkey was the sick man of the Near East, and the Treaty of Sèvres after the Great War imposed the most severe restrictions. In the end, relying on Kemal's vigorous resistance militarily and İsmet's arduous negotiations diplomatically, the Treaty of Lausanne was obtained, securing Turkish independence. All of these serve as models for the diplomacy of weak countries and ironclad proof that military and diplomatic affairs must be given equal importance.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country's diplomatic authorities over the years, they have been fond of grandstanding and neglecting practical matters. Internally, they use various exaggerated propaganda to deceive the people, and externally, they transfer personal followers to consolidate their own power. Everything is devoid of partisan character.</p>
<p>Talented people with experience and training are all discarded, while those related to their own faction, whether scientists, literary figures, or military personnel, can all hold the mission of the state and assume the heavy responsibility of negotiation. Even young and frivolous students studying abroad can preside over embassies and attend international conferences, making countless ugly scenes and laughingstocks everywhere. With such talent, how can one expect them to rescue our nation from danger and destruction diplomatically?</p>
<p>Moreover, for the past year, most of the ambassadors and consuls stationed abroad have been vacant and unreplaced, each being concurrently filled by ordinary staff members as acting representatives. Japan's military aggression against us has been ongoing for five months since the "August 13th Incident" and the "January 28th Incident." Only two representatives, Shi and Yan, have been sent to Geneva to hold the line, naturally suffering from the difficulty of one hand clapping. According to investigations, since July of last year, the staff members of foreign embassies have been facing the risk of starvation due to a lack of living expenses, and even postal and telegraphic expenses cannot be raised. The diplomatic situation is as urgent as a fire, but the embassies are cut off from communication with the motherland, causing the staff members and overseas compatriots to be at a loss all day long. Under this kind of diplomatic situation, how can one expect a diplomatic victory?</p>
<p>Moreover, today, at a time when the international situation is extremely tense, Japan is striving to conduct propaganda that violates the facts.</p>
<p>In this regard, the government authorities must first quickly dispatch experienced diplomats to thoroughly rectify the administration of foreign embassies.</p>
<p>Second, they must quickly raise funds to serve as resources for foreign embassies to communicate information and for all legitimate diplomatic purposes, so that the nerves of foreign embassies gradually progress from numbness to sensitivity. The means of response will also shift from slowness to agility. With adequate diplomatic support, negotiations can be handled effectively. This is the idea that military warfare and diplomatic warfare must echo each other.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Focus of the War Shifts to Wusong and Jiangwan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Enemy ships bombarded Wusong and then stopped immediately.</p>
<p>In the fierce battle at Jiangwan, our army obtained war spoils.</p>
<p>Gunfire in Zhabei does not constitute a formal war.</p>
<p>The enemy's strategy has shifted from Zhabei to Wusong. Jiangwan, being the connecting line between the two routes, is also valued by the enemy. The bombing of Wusong in recent days and the attack on Jiangwan yesterday are all manifestations of their strategic intent. The gunfire in Zhabei is merely a feint to the east while attacking the west. Our army calmly responds to the battle, holding the determination to attack when the enemy comes. Therefore, although the enemy's firepower is fierce, they are all repelled by our army. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e3">Wusong Yesterday's Battle Situation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Many enemy cavalrymen were ambushed and annihilated.</p>
<p>Enemy ships attacked the Lion Grove in the early morning.</p>
<p>Slight damage to civilian houses in Baoshan.</p>
<p>In the Wusong area, at around 7:00 PM on the day before yesterday (the 15th), artillery was used to attack our land from the south side of Yunzaobang. Several aircraft also dropped bombs on our army in the dark of night. Our army calmly responded. At around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy sent many cavalrymen to invade from the Xitangjiaqiao area, hoping to outflank our army's rear. They fell into our army's ambush and were annihilated, with countless war spoils seized. Also, at around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, four enemy ships bombarded our Lion Grove fortress from outside the Wusong Estuary with more than seventy shells. Three aircraft also dropped bombs in the Wusong and Baoshan areas to assist in the battle. Our army tried its best to respond, and after about an hour, the enemy still did not succeed. The battle situation yesterday and the war spoils seized by our army are separately compiled as follows:</p>
<p>The fierce battle at Jijiaqiao On the day before yesterday (the 15th), at around 7:00 PM, the enemy used artillery cover to launch a fierce attack on our army along the entire line from the south bank of Yunzaobang, Sitang River, to Jijiaqiao. At the same time, three enemy ships anchored at Zhanghuabang emitted searchlights to illuminate our army's front line positions, making our soldiers dizzy. Several aircraft circled the sky in the dark of night, randomly dropping bombs. Our army firmly defended the river, and the enemy ultimately did not succeed. The two sides fought fiercely all night, and by around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy's artillery fire became even more intense.</p>

<p>Annihilating Many Enemy Cavalrymen At the same time, the enemy again sent many cavalrymen, advancing rapidly with horses muzzled near Xitangjiaqiao, hoping to outflank our army's rear. Unexpectedly, more than fifty of our soldiers were ambushed in that area, carrying three machine guns. When the enemy cavalry passed through the area, they were immediately swept by our army's machine guns and hand grenades. The enemy cavalry was unprepared, and the enemy soldiers and horses were all annihilated by our army. The two sides fought fiercely, and by around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy was defeated and retreated. In this battle, our army seized many war spoils.</p>
<p>Small Contact Yesterday Afternoon From around 11:00 AM yesterday afternoon, the enemy used six or seven field guns to attack our army's positions north of the bank in the area south of Yunzaobang and Nanxujiawan, firing about one shot every ten minutes. Our army also returned fire from time to time, so the battle was not very intense, but it had not stopped by around 4:00 PM. Also, the town of Wusong, which was set on fire by enemy aircraft bombing from noon the day before yesterday, burned all night and had not been extinguished by 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Enemy Ships Attacked the Fortress Again At around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, four Japanese ships outside the Wusong Estuary attacked the Lion Grove Fortress directly north of Wusong for about an hour, firing more than seventy shots. Three Japanese aircraft also flew out from the aircraft carrier to drop bombs in places such as Wusong, Baoshan, Yuepu, and Luodian. Our army suffered no losses, but many civilian houses were destroyed. The investigation is as follows: (Wusong) Changshu Flower Shop on Waima Road, Fengji Rice Shop, Shengtai Rice Shop, Taichang Gravel Shop, Wanzi Villa on Xi'an Road, Liu Yulong's residence on Nanchang Road, Xu Xinshun's residence, the Eighth District Party Headquarters on Songxing Road, and Hesheng Silk Brocade Bureau were all hit by bombs and burned. When the artillery fire was intense, a platoon leader of the defense regiment, Xu Qiying, risked returning home to save his father and was killed by a shell on Nanchang Road, his legs blown off tragically. In addition, there were also eleven residents killed by bombs at the intersection of Wenchang Road. (Baoshan) Lin Xianji's residence in Dongmen, Liu Ziqiu's residence, Wu Shujiang's residence in Nanmen, Song Tingsan's residence on Shipi Street, and Chen Baoduo's residence in Caoxiebang were all destroyed. (Luodian) Zhu Hengchang Rice Shop and Pan Jia's residence were hit by bombs and destroyed. A shell landed in front of Zhu Yiyi's residence at Changpu Bridge, killing a pedestrian. (Yuepu) The Chen family in the northeast was shelled, destroying three buildings, and an old woman died.</p>
<p>Enemy Ships' Actions At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the first report from Bailonggang, Chuansha County, stated that there were fourteen enemy warships on the sea. Two ships headed towards Wusong after 3:00 PM. At 10:00 PM, the first report was received again, stating that twelve enemy ships were still on the sea there and had not left. Dama Evening News reported that the enemy army's airfield. The Second Japanese Air Force Headquarters has already been established on the open space of the Junpu Bureau on the east bank of the Huangpu River in the Gaoqiao District. Currently, Japanese aircraft fly out from there every day to drop bombs and scout military intelligence in the Yunzaobang and Wusong Fortress area. As for the Japanese army's First Airfield, it is located opposite the Dagong Cotton Mill outside the boundary of the Yangshupu Concession. Today (the 16th), twenty-five Japanese aircraft were seen parked on the field, including fifteen large bombers and ten single-seat pursuit planes. None of them flew out this morning. After the new Japanese military supplies arrived, several large aerial bombardment bombs, all over one foot in diameter and transported by rubber-tired vehicles, have been seen in the field today. Each vehicle carries only one bomb, estimated to weigh between 150 and 200 pounds. However, most of the bombs used by the Japanese army to date have been only between 50 and 25 pounds. Also, the Japanese originally planned to build an airfield east of Shanghai University, but it now seems to have stopped. The White Russians and Chinese workers who were leveling the land there a few days ago are no longer visible. Yesterday, the Japanese army installed two anti-aircraft guns in the airfield, protected by strong wire mesh, to prevent enemy aircraft from bombing. In addition, there were several anti-aircraft machine guns, and trenches were dug on the main roads outside the field, with soldiers stationed there. According to reports, all the aircraft used by the Japanese army in Shanghai to date are naval aircraft. As for the army aircraft, they were just transported here yesterday.</p>
<p>Enemy Army's Tanks The North China Daily News reported that after the Japanese army unloaded six light tanks from transport ships the day before yesterday, ten tanks with thick armor were unloaded again yesterday (the 14th). The tanks are equipped with rapid-firing light cannons and machine guns. This is the first time the Japanese army has transported real tanks to Shanghai. The Japanese army's third batch of transport ships, carrying the remaining troops of the Ninth Division and other reinforcements, has already set sail from their home country and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Enemy Army's Headquarters The Shanghai Times reported that the Japanese army headquarters is currently located at the Dagong Cotton Mill in Yangshupu. Cavalry and infantry battalions are stationed near the headquarters. A Shanghai Japanese reporter believes that Japan still has reinforcements coming to Shanghai. According to news from Tokyo, the Japanese government is currently considering sending additional reinforcements to Shanghai, so the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Shanghai will soon have 40,000 soldiers at his disposal.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Fierce Battle on Jiangwan Road <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>More than a dozen people were killed.</p>
<p>Four machine guns were seized.</p>
<p>The gunfire at night was all intimidation.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army changed its strategy and poured all its strength into attacking Wusong, the war situation on the Zhabei side has been relatively quiet. At dawn yesterday morning, the enemy fired at our positions with rifles, machine guns, and small steel cannons in the Qingyun Road, Baziqiao, and Tiantongan Road areas. We also returned fire, and it only stopped at around 9:00 AM. At 12:00 PM, gunfire started again in the Baziqiao area, and the enemy's artillery fire was extremely dense. Both sides had only small contacts. Our army firmly defended its position and responded calmly, and the enemy had no opportunity to take advantage of. At 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, about 200 enemies charged towards our positions on Jiangwan Road. Our army fought bravely, and as a result, more than eighty enemies were killed and four machine guns were seized. The enemy retreated in disarray. After 8:00 PM in the evening, the enemy bombarded us with artillery again for about an hour before stopping, but the gunfire started again after 10:00 PM, firing one or two shots per minute, and stopped again at 12:00 PM. It continued to fire sporadically after 2:00 AM and had not stopped by 3:30 AM. It was all intimidation, and there was actually no fierce battle between the two sides.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Enemy Aircraft Dropped Bombs Everywhere <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>A bomb was dropped in Zhenru but did not explode.</p>
<p>They also went to Dachang and Gujiazhen to scout.</p>
<p>Enemy aircraft fly to Zhenru every morning and circle around. At around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, four Japanese aircraft flew from Wusong to Zhenru. They gradually descended as they flew over the sky above Jinan University, then flew over the south of the station, and then circled to the northwest, dropping one bomb that did not explode. At that time, our army shot at the Japanese aircraft with rifles and anti-aircraft guns, and the Japanese aircraft fled towards Jiangwan. One Japanese aircraft flew over Dajing within the territory from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM yesterday morning, flying at an extremely high altitude and circling around. The Japanese aircraft was no longer seen after 2:00 PM. Also, four Japanese aircraft took off from the east at around 8:00 AM yesterday and scouted and bombed our rear defense. However, due to the protests of the concession authorities, they have recently stopped flying over the sky above the concession. Most of the places they fly over are beyond Qingyun Road, such as Jiangwan, Dachang, and Fuhang. Within the concession, frontline soldiers play phonographs for entertainment (Photo by Li Zunyong).</p>
<p>Due to the direction of the wind, extremely faint engine sounds can sometimes be heard. Yesterday, enemy aircraft took off at 8:00 AM and bombed after scouting Baoshan and Wusong, and turned to the Dachang Gujiazhen area at around 9:00 AM. In order to prevent our anti-aircraft guns from bombing, the enemy aircraft did not dare to fly low and circled again before descending and dropping a bomb, dropping a total of five or six. After our side bombarded with small steel cannons, they immediately fled. They came again at 2:00 PM, dropped a bomb in Dachang, destroying three civilian houses, and two bombs dropped in Gujiazhai mostly landed in the fields and did not damage houses or livestock.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The US Ambassador Does Not Comment <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>He Only Wants to Know the Truth About Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that US Ambassador Johnson stated yesterday (the 15th) that his trip to Shanghai was not to impose peace terms on either of the warring parties, but only to know the truth about the situation in Shanghai. The US Ambassador did not comment on the results of his investigation, but reiterated that his trip was only of an educational nature. However, the US Ambassador held informal consultations with the ministers of several other countries and visited the headquarters of the US Marine Corps and the 31st Infantry Battalion and inspected the lines defended by the US Army. Although the date of the US Ambassador's trip to Beijing has not been determined, there are rumors that he will set off on a destroyer on Wednesday or Thursday. He will be entertained by Mayor Wu today (the 16th). Gu Weijun visited him yesterday, and it is said that there was no political overtone.</p>

<p>The Japanese newspaper Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that the US government has expressed its opposition to the (Japanese) government's proposal that major Chinese cities should not be allowed to have armed preparedness. Now, the UK also believes that this proposal is extremely incomplete, and there is no possibility of approving Japan's proposal. Therefore, the intention of the Japanese ambassadors to petition the governments of various countries has been greatly hit.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Japanese Consul Formally Apologizes <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the US Consulate General received a formal apology from the Japanese Consul General yesterday (the 15th) regarding the case in which Japanese ronin and naval soldiers committed violence against US Vice Consul Lin Huade and American Chinese Ms. Yang on the 10th of this month. According to reports, since the incident occurred, the US Consul General protested to the Japanese Consul General on the 11th. After the Japanese authorities conducted an investigation, they only responded yesterday. An official from the Japanese Consulate General delivered the formal apology letter to the US Consulate General. However, it is not yet known whether the US Consul General will negotiate again. According to Lin Huade, as far as he is concerned, he believes that the case is completely concluded and denies having been injured or kicked.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Comments on Our Army's Trenches <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Calling Them the Crystallization of Modern Tactics</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun published a special telegram from Qinggang, Shanghai, saying that our army (the Japanese army) has been bombing with aircraft and artillery from time to time for two weeks. Except for the fields where civilian houses have turned into rubble, the enemy army (our army) is still firmly defending its original positions and continuing to resist. Enemy shadows are rarely seen during the day, but at night they secretly attack our (Japanese) lines. The enemy's positions are built according to modern tactics and are semi-permanent trenches. Their complexity and solidity are exactly the same as the trench style of the French front during the European War. The four lines of defense, first, second, third, and fourth, etc., are connected by tunnels as dense as a network. The complexity of the structure is difficult to imitate, so even if they are directly bombarded by artillery and bombs, there is still no major loss. The first line of defense is six feet wide and about six or seven feet deep, covered with iron plates and sandbags. The solidity of the defense methods is amazed by many Europeans and Americans. Only the barrels of field guns are exposed on the ground of the defense line, and they are also covered with solid iron plates to prevent aircraft bombs. This kind of hidden trench has countless gun holes and terrifying machine gun muzzles, as dense as honeycombs. In particular, the shooting method of machine guns, the throwing method of hand grenades, the use of rifles, and the tactics of attacking and defending positions have completely transformed from Chinese-style warfare into a purely sophisticated warfare style of a certain country. The crystallization of modern tactics is indeed making it impossible for our army (Japanese army) to cope. (Translated directly from Japanese) (Reporter's note: The enemy is also aware that they cannot cope with the solidity of our army's defenses and the use of soldiers, and they only use artillery fire to destroy civilian houses and kill innocent people. Their behavior is too brutal.)</p>
<p>Military Commission and President Wang</p>
<h3 id="e10">Replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yesterday by Telegram <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Made a Substantive Statement on Shanghai's Defense</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Military Commission and President of the Executive Yuan Wang Zhaoming yesterday, which is recorded as follows: (1) Limited to arrival immediately, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Jian, the steamed telegram has been read carefully. This committee not only pays special attention to the preservation of various places but also has the determination to resist Japan thoroughly as a whole. Regarding Shanghai, reinforcements have been successively dispatched, but because things seek to be secretly accomplished, it is inconvenient to report in detail, I hope you understand and convey condolences to all the compatriots in Shanghai. Military Commission Han (2) Municipal Chamber of Commerce Jian, the steamed telegram has been read carefully. The government has a unified plan for aid to Shanghai and national defense. However, the matter concerns safety and cannot be revealed. However, each division has doubled its efforts to provide assistance after reaching its destination, and there have been telegrams to various newspapers. Tianjin has already published them. Why is there no news in Shanghai? Please investigate. Wang Zhaoming Han,</p>
<h3 id="e11">Various Military News from the Japanese Side <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Nomura and Uematsu Almost Suffered a Misfortune The Japanese newspaper Jiji Shinpo (12th) reported that the enemy's plainclothes team has been harassing us constantly. Student volunteers holding weapons and ammunition dare to challenge us (the Japanese army) within a station of the Marine Corps headquarters, and their bold and invincible actions have stunned our army. (Translated directly from Japanese) The most dangerous thing was at 3:20 PM on the 10th, when Commander Uematsu was reporting the battle situation to the Marine Corps headquarters, two enemy mortar shells suddenly fell on the liquor store of the headquarters, and six shells fell in the garden. Nomura and Uematsu almost suffered a bombing.</p>
<p>Enemy Army Hurry to Install Military Cables Yesterday afternoon, the enemy army sent several engineers to Tangshan Road to hurry up and install military telephones, which were hung all the way to Peng Road, Sanyuan Temple, North Sichuan Road, and other places.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers' White Military Uniforms and Masks Pacific News Agency reported that at 1:30 PM yesterday, more than fifty Japanese soldiers were found at the Huangpu Wharf, all wearing white military uniforms, with the shirts and pants connected. The style of the clothes was the same as the worker's work clothes, and all wore white masks.</p>
<p>The Reason for the Japanese Army's Car Accident Yesterday, a Japanese Marine Corps truck collided with a truck rescuing hard-hit civilians. It is now under investigation by the Public Works Bureau's stationed troops and the relief committee. The reason is that the newly arrived Japanese drivers in Shanghai are used to walking on the right side of the road, resulting in the accident. Now, relief work cannot be stopped. Therefore, heavy-duty vehicles operating in the northern and eastern districts must be especially careful. It is said that due to the car accident, ten members of the Japanese Marine Corps were seriously injured, and two of them may be in danger. The committee has now contacted the 31st Regiment of the US Army to set up its headquarters in Jardine House. Thirty members of the US Marine Corps are now stationed at Yucai Public School. The counselors serving in the Ben Mansion are temporarily renting a room in the National Hotel.</p>
<p>Jardine Cotton Mill Not Occupied by Japanese Soldiers The Information Office of the Public Works Bureau issued a letter stating that the English-language Shanghai Times reported a few days ago that Lieutenant General Ueda of the Japanese Army had established his headquarters at the Jardine Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road, which is completely inaccurate and has been corrected by the newspaper itself. The Jardine Factory belongs to a British company and cannot be used as a headquarters by the Japanese army. Moreover, the factory has never been stationed by the troops of any country. According to the current investigation, the Japanese army headquarters is located at the Japanese-owned Dagong Cotton Mill, which is outside the concession.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Do Not Come to the Public Concession Dama Evening News reported today (the 16th) that the Japanese authorities have formally guaranteed to the Public Works Bureau that Japanese aircraft will no longer fly over the Public Concession unless absolutely necessary. Regarding the incident of Japanese aircraft flying over the concession, the Public Works Bureau sent a letter to the Japanese Consul General on the 8th of this month to protest. Recently, it received a reply from the Japanese Consul General Murai, stating that after the intention of the letter had been conveyed to the relevant authorities in the home country, it has been reported that all aviation personnel have been strictly ordered not to fly over the Public Concession unless absolutely necessary. It is expected that this kind of situation will certainly not happen again in the future.</p>

<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Mayor Wu, accompanied by Director Mai of the Social Bureau, Director Hu of the Health Bureau, and Secretary Huang Jianfen, went to various hospitals to visit the wounded soldiers. First, they went to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road, followed by Tongde Hospital, Epidemic Hospital, Red Cross, and Beishi Hospital to visit. Mayor Wu inquired in detail about the injuries and treatment of the wounded soldiers and sent each person a comfort payment of four yuan. He was extremely indignant at the wounded soldiers who had suffered Dum-Dum bullet wounds. Before leaving, he instructed them one by one to rest assured and recuperate. Some of the soldiers were moved to tears and vowed to return to the battlefield to kill the enemy after recovery. He only returned to the municipal government at 12:00 PM, and it was heard that he would continue to visit other hospitals the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News published a letter from a German, Mollenhauer, stating that it has recently been rumored that the German military advisors of the National Government are currently participating in the anti-Japanese war of the 19th Route Army or other Chinese regular troops around Shanghai. As I have close relationships with many German military advisors in Nanjing, I feel obligated to correct this rumor. I have learned from absolutely reliable sources that no Germans are participating in the campaign as advisors or commanders. Since the start of the war, the troops have entered the battlefield, and the advisors have nothing to do, so they have all been given leave to go elsewhere.</p>

<p>Since the 19th Route Army fought against the violent Japanese, all sectors of society have been extremely enthusiastic in donating money and goods, which the army has thanked in the newspaper on a daily basis. However, yesterday, someone suddenly went to the Shanghai office of the army to inquire whether they had received donations from the Shanghai People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association. The army has never used the name of the army to donate money outside since the anti-Japanese war and has issued a statement in the newspaper. The donations from the Shanghai People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association have also not been received.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reported last night (the 15th) that the Japanese side will release eighty Chinese, suspected of being plainclothes soldiers, to the investigation committee appointed by the Shanghai Consular Corps within a few days for interrogation and release.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Conditions After the Battle of Zhabei <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Already a Scene of Brick and Rubble</p>
<p>Since the Japanese troops launched an attack against us in northern Shanghai on the night of January 28th of last month, our side has been resisting in self-defense. The battle has lasted for twenty days, and Zhabei and Wusong have been reduced to ashes. The magnitude of the loss is difficult to calculate. In the prosperous area of northern Shanghai alone, the public and private losses from the enemy's bombing by artillery and aircraft amount to at least one hundred million yuan. The reporter is also a member of the disaster-stricken area of northern Shanghai. My whole family was destroyed by artillery fire, and the remaining belongings were looted by local bandits. My family of seven has become what the saying goes, "What you eat is in your stomach, what you wear is on your back," homeless people. The Japanese 9th Infantry Division came to Shanghai this time, and the enemy forces have been rotating defenses in the past two days. The war on the front line has subsided slightly. The reporter and two friends decided to risk going home to see the situation in the war zone.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Da Tong Road Littered with Corpses <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The reporter and two friends detoured from western Shanghai to Zhabei. The purpose of this trip was to know that our residence, Yongxing Road, was on the front line of Baoshan Road, making it difficult to get home. We also knew that our residence, Huaxing Lane, had been completely looted by bandits, and there would be no belongings left in the house. However, to see the truth, we did not hesitate to take the risk. We did not go to move things. We still set off at dawn, and by around 7 a.m., we had arrived at Da Tong Road in northern Shanghai. There were very few pedestrians at the end of Da Tong Road. When approaching Gonghe New Road, we saw corpses piled up on both sides of the road, mostly women and children. They were all killed by the inhuman Japanese airplanes, bombs, and artillery. Because there was no way to collect the bodies, they were lying on the road, covered with reed mats. What was most unforgettable was that one corpse had its head and part of its arm eaten by wild dogs, with blood all over the ground. I almost thought I was in a scene of hell.</p>
<h3 id="e19">No Soldiers Seen Along the Way <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>When we arrived at a certain road, we were already in the war zone. What we saw was that the prosperous streets of twenty days ago had now been turned into a burned area of collapsed walls. There was not a single person seen in that area, which was most peculiar. However, we heard very clear gunshots, seemingly coming from nearby, but we did not see a single soldier. While we were in shock, four or five armed comrades who were loyal and brave appeared, gesturing with their guns. We raised our hands and explained the reason for returning home to visit relatives. The armed comrades sincerely advised us not to take such great risks and treat our lives as a game. We insisted on going forward, so one of the armed comrades led us to a safer road, going north and then east. We cautiously walked, passing by a place where we saw several armed comrades calmly smoking cigarettes and reading newspapers in a ruined house that had been bombed.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Strange Scenery of Remaining Houses After the Fire <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>We experienced a lot of panic before we were able to reach our destination, near Yongxing Road, at the risk of great danger. To the west of Huaxing Lane were the houses of Guangyu Lane and another lane. Originally, there were a dozen or so lanes with thousands of residents. After the outbreak of the war, the area was set on fire. The people guarding the lane told the reporter that the fire in this place was purely set by people from Jiangbei who took the opportunity to loot. It was clear that it was not destroyed by bombing. We looked around and saw that the first lane was burned, the second lane was intact, the third lane was burned, and the fourth lane was complete again. The fifth lane was burned again. Those that were not burned all had their doors open, and all the belongings were looted.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Huaxing Lane Destroyed by Bombing <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The lanes near Yongxing Road were all bombed by artillery and airplanes, but the 200 houses in Huaxing Lane remained standing. This was the third time the reporter returned, and it was very different from the scene of the past few days. The lane was in the key area of the front line. At first, there were armed comrades guarding the eastern section, but now most of the iron gates were open. The houses in the fourth lane were bombed by Japanese airplanes the day before yesterday, and all the houses were bombed and collapsed. Entering the lane, it had become a pile of rubble. The reporter felt all sorts of emotions at this point. What crime did our people commit to suffer such misery? Looking around, Donghongxingfang, Xiangshan Road, Xiangxin Lane, and Hongji Lane were mostly ruins and rubble. It was heard that a pregnant woman in the lane was bombed and trapped in a collapsed house, and the body had not been taken out yet.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Baoshan Road Ten Houses Empty <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>When the war suddenly broke out, most of the residents in the Baoshan Road area only managed to escape with their bare bodies. All their clothes, money, and valuables were abandoned in their homes, thinking that they could go and retrieve them in a day or two. Initially, they did not expect the brutality of the Japanese, who bombed this prosperous area day and night with airplanes and artillery. The first two times the reporter returned home, the items in the room were completely undamaged, but the artillery fire was too intense to carry them out. When we returned this time, it was very different. In the undamaged houses near Baoshan Road, both the front and back doors were broken, and the valuables inside were looted, leaving only wooden furniture. Every household was like this, so-called ten houses empty. When the reporter arrived home, we saw that the trunks were all destroyed, and old clothes were thrown all over the ground. There was not a single item left that could be considered intact. In this front line, they dared to loot, the bandits were bold, and their behavior was terrible.</p>

<p>According to reports, the looters had guns. The people guarding the lane could only let them loot.</p>

<p>The reporter and others saw that our home had been completely looted and there was nothing to take, so we had to return with heartache. The three of us can be said to have not taken a single item. On the way back, the sound of gunfire started again. We seemed to be bolder than the previous two times. We met a refugee on the way, who lived in the Sanjiao Small Vegetable Market in Hongkou. He had escaped two days ago and came to Zhabei to see his relatives but did not meet them. According to him, the cruelty of the Japanese in Hongkou was outrageous. He said that the Japanese set up artillery on the upper level of the small vegetable market to bombard, and on the road, they arbitrarily killed our refugees. The most cruel thing was to capture our refugees, gouge out their eyes, and put the bodies of the refugees in sacks and throw them into the river.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Declaration of the Shanghai General Labor Union <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Supporting the 19th Route Army to Resist Japan to the End</p>
<p>The War in Shanghai Concerns the Survival of the Entire Nation</p>
<p>Those Who Seek Personal Gain Will Be Punished by Everyone</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union yesterday issued a special declaration supporting the loyal and brave soldiers of the 19th Route Army to resist Japan to the end and opposing the establishment of a so-called peace zone. The main points are excerpted as follows: The diplomatic and military strategies should be based on the fact that Shanghai will not yield. If Shanghai yields, the violent Japanese will inevitably advance and make all our coastal and riverine areas yield. Based on this, we dare to make three promises to the people of the whole country: 1. We vow to oppose the establishment of so-called neutral zones or peace zones. 2. We vow to carry out the resistance movement to the end. 3. We must gather the strength of the whole country to support the 19th Route Army and complete the goal of saving the country from Japan. If anyone does not follow this principle, dares to defy the great righteousness of the world, and yields to Japanese imperialism, they are abandoning themselves to the people. Our people must regard them as traitors, and all traitors must be punished by everyone. This declaration is hereby made for public scrutiny.</p>

<p>Strictly Prevent Indirect Purchase of Rice</p>
<p>According to news from the rice industry yesterday, at this time when the enemy is rampant and survival is at stake, there are still rice merchants who are greedy for profit and sell grain to the enemy, which is regrettable. It is said that the Japanese, fearing that it would be difficult to purchase directly from Chinese merchants, have entrusted Western merchants to purchase indirectly. However, Europeans and Americans mainly eat wheat and do not eat rice. Now, suddenly purchasing a large amount of rice is suspicious. Patriotic rice merchants should not ignore this. Furthermore, Chinese people purchase rice limited to five dou, while foreigners continuously purchase dozens or hundreds of dan, transporting them to the enemy camp at night during curfew. Rice merchants and those working in foreign residences should pay attention at all times and try to prevent them. Their contribution to saving the country is no less than the soldiers who died on the front line.</p>

<p>Protesting to Japan and Demanding Compensation</p>
<p>Allocating Funds to Assist in Relocating and Reopening</p>
<p>The Wusong Fisheries School suffered heavy losses in the Japanese artillery bombardment. Yesterday, teachers and staff of the school, including Wang Chaoji, telegraphed the Education Department, reporting, "Director Zhou of the Zhenjiang Provincial Education Department, the Japanese invaders have committed atrocities in Shanghai, repeatedly bombarding the fortress. The entire town of Wusong has been reduced to ashes. Our school, located at the mouth of the Song River, has been severely damaged by bombs. Only the remaining walls of the classrooms and factories remain. Machines and specimens have been reduced to ashes. Japanese soldiers have also landed to search and arrest students. It is difficult to investigate the missing students. The fate of those arrested is unknown. Our school is the only institution that has trained fisheries professionals for more than 20 years. Students have also been most active in the anti-Japanese movement, which has long been resented by the Japanese. This bombing, judging from the marine specimens collected by teachers and students over the years and the navigation and astronomical instruments purchased with huge sums of money, has caused losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars. We are extremely saddened by the destruction. We have asked Principal Feng to find a way to sort out the ruins and establish a liaison office in Shanghai to gather students. We are telegraphing to your department, requesting that you forward this to the government. All losses of our school should be seriously protested to Japan and compensation should be reserved. Please allocate a considerable amount of temporary funds to allow the principal to temporarily relocate to a suitable address, prepare for classes, and complete the students' studies. Please borrow necessary equipment from other provincial middle schools to maintain operations. We await your instructions."

<p>At around 1 p.m. yesterday, there was a rumor that a Japanese plane had crashed at the racecourse in the British Concession. More than a thousand people gathered to watch. When the reporter heard the news, we rushed to see that it was a small British plane. It was heard that after the plane landed, the pilot jumped out and drove away in a car. The plane was shaped like a goldfish, with a silver fuselage and the letters "US" on it. It is still parked inside the racecourse. It is said that the plane came from Nanjing.</p>

<p>Do Not Resort to Beating</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Police Announcement No. 3: For the purpose of public announcement, since the Japanese instigated the incident, the territory of this city has been devastated. There are also ignorant people who throw bombs and disrupt the local area. Our police have been conducting strict investigations with the assistance of the public and have solved many cases, eliminating unrest. It is commendable. However, of the people arrested by the public, after detailed interrogation by this bureau, there are indeed many whose criminal evidence is conclusive, but there are still many who have no criminal suspicion at all. Some are suspected because of unusual language, or criticized because of strange behavior. One person raises their arm, and the crowd blindly follows, dragging and beating them. If this is allowed to continue, how can we maintain order and security? Therefore, we inform the citizens of this city that in the face of national crisis, we must have a spirit of perseverance and not be carried away by excitement. Patriotism and law-abidingness are equally important. From now on, we must strictly abide by the law and not overstep the boundaries. If you encounter a person with suspicious behavior, you should report it or hand them over to the police. Do not resort to beating. If there is any injury, the head of this bureau will only deal with it according to the law and will not condone it. Everyone must comply with this announcement.

<p>Since its inception, the Women's Military Clothing Donation Association has received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life. It is heard that the mother of Chen Tiaoyuan donated another 1,000 yuan yesterday. The association has produced more than 2,000 silk-cotton and cotton vests. Yesterday, the association's women representatives personally transported 1,000 pieces to the Zhenru Headquarters and received a receipt. The association's representative told reporters that, according to the survey, the vests sent by various parties are sufficient, but there is still a shortage of cotton coats, military blankets, raincoats, telescopes, and steel helmets. For practical purposes, the association plans to continue fundraising and manufacture them separately, striving to ensure that the money of our enthusiastic compatriots is not wasted and that our armed comrades can benefit from it. We hope that all sectors will give their support, such as collecting funds to purchase them directly, handing them over directly, or entrusting the association to handle the delivery. All are welcome.</p>

<p>Ms. Wu Rouan, the manager of Tongyi Trust Company, has been serving in the education sector of this city for many years and has always been enthusiastic about social welfare undertakings. This time, because the 19th Route Army loyally and bravely resisted Japan, she initiated fundraising to make silk-cotton vests to serve as military needs. The company's employees, customers, and Wu's friends all happily donated money to support the event. Jiang Shaoliang raised the most money. Wu personally led more than a dozen female employees of the company to rush to make them overnight.

<p>The National Crisis Soldier Relief Association initiated the formation of the Red Cross Seventh Rescue Team in cooperation with the Shanghai Medical Association, Tongde Medical College, Dongwu Medical College, Fudan Medical College, and Sino-French Academy. Since the beginning of the rescue efforts in Zhenru, the work has been extremely busy. Team members went to Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, and other war zones, rescuing countless wounded soldiers and refugees. All team members disregarded their own safety and went out to provide care. Recently, Liu Qiduan, a member of the team, led nurses to the Zhabei war zone on the morning of the 15th of this month to care for wounded soldiers. Unfortunately, he was shot by Japanese ambushes. He was immediately sent to Jiangnan Hospital for surgery, but due to the severity of his injuries, he passed away at noon on the 16th. Various organizations have already made arrangements for his funeral. Currently, the team members are still working hard to provide rescue efforts and have elected Dr. Wu Yichu as the team leader and Wu Pinzhou as the deputy team leader. Every day, the team leader personally accompanies seriously wounded soldiers to Shanghai for treatment. The team, due to the excessive number of wounded soldiers in Shanghai, contacted the National Crisis Soldier Relief Association to establish the Seventh Rear Soldier Hospital in Suzhou, with Tang Zhou as the director. The address is currently at the Suzhou Xiajint Bridge Agricultural School. It has already opened and can accommodate approximately 2,000 people. The scale is grand and the equipment is complete. All expenses for the Zhenru team headquarters and the Suzhou rear soldier hospital are generously borne by the ladies of the National Crisis Soldier Relief Association. The transportation of wounded soldiers in Zhenru has been arranged by the Seventh Team in consultation with the military authorities. If other rescue teams have wounded soldiers, they can also be sent to the Zhenru Seventh Team for transportation to Suzhou for hospitalization and treatment.</p>

It is hoped that all sectors of society will provide material assistance.

Relief vehicles can enter but cannot exit. All vehicles from charitable organizations must detour via Xinzha Bridge to reach their destinations, making relief work extremely difficult. It is heard that the most urgent needs of refugees in various shelters are still clothing and bedding.</p>

<p>British Consulate Has No Action Yet</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Ke Yinhang, sent a wireless telegram on Sunday night asking American women and children in Beijing and Shanghai to move to safer locations immediately. It was found that there are currently 24 American nationals in Wuxi, 105 in Suzhou, 10 in Changshu, 13 in Changzhou, and 18 in Jiangyin. This move is only for precautionary purposes. It is reported that the majority will move to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, according to the British Consulate General, the British authorities have not taken this measure and have not discussed it. The number of British nationals in the above five places is less than that of American nationals, and there are not many women and children.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that, according to Dr. Wu Liande, the office and quarantine hospital of the Wusong Seaport Quarantine Office have been completely destroyed by repeated bombings by the Japanese army, and all equipment has been reduced to ashes.

<p>Wentaizhou Wheels Resume Service After the outbreak of the war, all Chinese merchant ships in this port were suspended. The six round-trip companies within the Wentaizhou line also announced the suspension of voyages. Recently, refugees from Shanghai fled to Wentaizhou and other places, and they inquired about sailing schedules at various companies every day. Yesterday, the Lian'an Shipping Association, in response to the needs of the Wentaizhou villagers, decided to allow the six companies to resume services starting today. It was agreed that one ship will depart from Shanghai every Tuesday and Friday to provide transportation for refugees leaving Shanghai. However, if there is no obstruction in the Wusong area, it can operate on schedule. If the war interferes with the route, the schedule will be postponed and cannot be fixed. The purpose is to ensure travel safety.</p>
<p>Seven Transport Ships Leave Shanghai Two days ago, sixteen transport merchant ships loaded with the Ninth Division of the Japanese Army arrived in Shanghai. After unloading the soldiers and ammunition, the first batch of nine ships left for Japan. Yesterday afternoon, another seven ships also left Shanghai from Huishan and Huangpu wharfs. It is reported that they were sailing back to the East, and one of the ships was loaded with a large number of wounded soldiers returning to their country. At 2:50 pm, the transport ship Shanghai Maru came to Shanghai again from Japan. It is reported that it was loaded with a lot of military support team materials. There were also four or five hundred Japanese residents in Shanghai who were carried away free of charge by various transport ships.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Zhu Qinglan Concerned About Disaster Relief <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Forgetting Foreign Regret Does Not Forget Domestic Disaster</p>
<p>Zhu Ziqiao, member of the National Government Flood Relief Committee and director of the Disaster Area Working Group, was very concerned about the impact of the Shanghai war on disaster relief work in various provinces. He sent a telegram to the specialist staff in various districts and the directors of the Industrial and Relief Bureaus in various districts a few days ago, asking them to proceed with the relief work as usual to avoid delays. The following is a summary of the original telegram and the replies from various districts: (Telegram) To the specialists in various districts and the directors of the Industrial and Relief Bureaus in various districts, I believe that disaster relief has been more important than any other job since ancient times. There is still a lot of wheat flour for emergency relief that was sent to various districts but has not been distributed, so it should be actively carried out and relief provided as soon as possible. The levee repair project before the spring flood is particularly important. The Shanghai Incident has occurred, and we rely on the military authorities to bravely resist and win successive victories. This group should immediately carry out industrial and agricultural revitalization and should not be interrupted in the slightest to delay relief. This is hereby telegraphed, and I hope that we will all encourage each other and await a reply. Zhu Qinglan (Reply Telegram) 1. Hu Pinyuan, Yangzhou 14th District Industrial and Relief Bureau, telegraphed on the Qing day, the transportation and levee project is imminent, and this bureau is actively proceeding without interruption. The first section is being surveyed in Jiangdu, and workers will be recruited to start work soon. The second section started work in Gaoyou on the Yan day of last month, but was temporarily suspended due to rain and snow, and construction will continue when the weather is clear. The third section is scheduled to start work in Yaotan Suqian on the Hui day. I respectfully reply. 2. Xu Junti, Dongtai, Hui telegraphed that the first section of Baoduo River and the fourth section of Zhugang in this district have started construction, and the Longgang Caiwan and drainage projects of Chungdou are also being prepared for surveying. Please order the office to issue the various regular and preparatory funds for each section on time to facilitate progress. 3. Zong Xishang, Nanjing, Hui telegraphed that the work in this district is still being carried out with effort even within the scope of the incident, but the current lack of disaster workers is a major problem. As a result of the previous telegram, in addition to strictly urging those who have taken leave to return to work, we should continue to work as usual. 4. Zhang Chongji, Wuhu 13th District Industrial and Relief Bureau, Hui telegraphed that the industrial and relief work in this district is being actively prepared. If the wheat and grain are delivered on time at the end of this month, several sections can be started. Regarding the engineering plan, it has been rushed out completely overnight. I will definitely live up to your great intentions and work hard. 5. Pei Yixiang, Anqing, steamed telegraphed that the official bureau's industrial and relief work has not been slackened so far. However, the remaining funds are only enough for the workers in the five sections currently open for two months. Each of these sections is now in urgent need of processing, and the places are also urging the remaining non-opened sections, and some have formed construction teams and are waiting to start work. Without sufficient relief, not only will those who have not started work not be able to start work, but even the five sections that have already been opened will not be able to support them for two months after processing. Please order the Transportation and Storage Department, Mr. Beck, to follow the agreed number of grains to be transported each month in accordance with the exchange documents, and find a way to provide assistance, and please instruct whether the ones that have already been opened should be processed, and whether the ones that have not been opened should be established on a certain day, so that there will be a follow-up. 6. Special Commissioner Chen of Hankou, steamed telegraphed that the urgent agricultural and industrial relief here is proceeding as usual without interruption, but most of the work in the seventh, eighth, and ninth districts is difficult due to transportation difficulties and the bandits have not been cleared. It is impossible to handle it without changing the price of the relief wheat. 7. Director Jiang of Wuchang, Mingjing, telegraphed on his behalf that the projects in each district of this province have not been interrupted, but the progress in the sixth and seventh districts is slower. In addition to sending separate letters, please transfer them to the two districts to proceed as soon as possible, and please continue to allocate funds and wheat on schedule. 8. Yu Jichuan, Chenglingpu, Hui telegraphed that the industrial and relief work in this district is proceeding actively as usual, but the transportation of wheat is delayed, and not many workers have arrived, and bandit alarms are often heard, making progress difficult. Please continue to find a way to provide assistance to facilitate work. 9. Commissioner Yang of Zhengzhou, Jia telegraphed that more than 9,000 tons of relief wheat in Henan Province have been transported. 8,000 tons have been allocated for urgent industrial and agricultural relief. 1,000 tons have been allocated to the six counties of Guanghuang Guxiluoshan and Shang, and the allocated ones have been completely transported. However, although they have been allocated to various counties, only half of them have been transported and have not yet been transported. Small-scale industrial relief has already been carried out, and 16 counties plan to complete the relief work during the spring famine.</p>
<h3 id="e67">North China Telegrams Smoothly Unobstructed <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yantai Submarine Cables, Both New and Old, are Broken</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Chinese Telegraph Office Used Other Cables to Remedy the Situation</p>
<p>Telegrams from Shanghai to Northern ports such as Beiping and Tianjin were previously transmitted through the Yantai submarine cables. There were originally two of these cables, new and old. The new cable was damaged and the transmission was suspended as soon as the war broke out in Wusong. All official and commercial telegrams sent from Shanghai went through the old cable. However, starting at 7 p.m. last night, the old cable was also suddenly damaged, and the telegrams to the north were temporarily suspended. Later, after the Chinese Telegraph Office made every effort to find a way, a land cable was set aside exclusively for Tianjin, and all telegrams to Beiping, Qingdao, and Yantai were smoothly transmitted. The new and old submarine cables will also be repaired as soon as possible to facilitate reporting.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Second Special Ship to Hong Kong Set to Sail <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Twenty-First of this Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sichuan Road China Travel Service, in view of the large number of passengers going to Hong Kong in recent days, specially selected the postal ship "Xuedanna" of the British Postal Ship Company to schedule a special ship to sail directly from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 19th of this month. All cabins were filled in an instant. Those who had not made reservations still flocked in. The company has now reached an agreement with Jardine Matheson, a British merchant, to select the 10,000-ton giant ship "Haosheng" (Hosang) to depart from Shanghai directly to Hong Kong on the 21st of this month (Sunday). The fares for this ship are: first-class large dining room, national currency 107 yuan, second-class large dining room, national currency 60 yuan, and third-class cabin (including meals), national currency 20 yuan (bedding to be provided by oneself). The cabins of this ship are spacious and the voyage is stable and fast, and there are Cantonese compradors to take care of the passengers. It is even more considerate. Those who want to purchase tickets or move luggage can contact the head office on Sichuan Road and the west district branch at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road (new building of the YMCA) and the Baxianqiao branch. It is reported that two-thirds of the cabins have been booked yesterday, but passengers must be vaccinated against smallpox first.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau Announcement</p>
<h3 id="e69">Winter Tax Collection Extended by One Month <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Until March 15</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau issued an announcement yesterday, which said, "For the purpose of announcement, the winter tax, reed tax, Jinshan Bangjin transportation, and garrison land rent, etc., collected by this bureau for the 20th year, were launched on December 16th of the 20th year, limited to February 15th of this year, which is the deadline for two months. However, since the outbreak of military affairs, traffic has been blocked, and people have found it inconvenient to deposit grain in the treasury. In view of the situation, this bureau has asked for an extension of the deadline on the 10th of this month for the sake of caring for the people. Now, the municipal government's No. 421 order states that it has been approved as requested for an extension of one month, and it should be announced to the public and the personnel in charge of collection should be supervised to handle it conscientiously to meet the urgent needs. This order is issued to inform the people of this city that the winter tax, reed tax, Jinshan Bangjin transportation, and garrison land rent, etc., for the 20th year, will be extended by one month from February 16th to March 15th. The people, etc., must come to the treasury quickly within the extended period to pay off the debt and obtain the certificate to secure their property. Do not wait and see for self-harm, carefully. This announcement is made."</p>

<h3 id="e70">Drafting Measures for Rental Assistance <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Committee Appointed to Draft Measures</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the incident caused by the violent Japanese, residents in the Zhabei and Hongkou areas have been arbitrarily killed by the Japanese, which is unbearable to hear. At this time, all of us Chinese should be aware that property is an external thing. In the face of this foreign insult, it is a matter of life and death for our families. Although the 19th Route Army has bravely resisted and won successive victories, the dangerous situation cannot be reversed. I expect that although we cannot join the army and directly resist, we should do our best to assist indirectly, which can encourage morale and provide permanent resistance, hoping to achieve final victory. The Liangxin Patriotic Corps of this city sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, urging all Chinese landlords in the concession to launch a donation of one month's rent to raise military funds. It is reported that the association has submitted it to the 81st Standing Committee for discussion, and it was resolved to appoint Fang Jiaobo and Luo Qinghua to draft measures for further verification and processing.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Verdict in the Baoshan Road Massacre <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>You Bolu Sentenced to Two Years and Six Months on All Charges</p>
<p>Temporary Bail Approved Pending Appeal</p>
<p>Fifth District Chief You Bolu, along with police officers Lin Qingxiang, Liu Weicheng, Wu Maolin, Qiao Xuechang, Wu Zhanyou, and six others, were sentenced yesterday by the District Court. The presiding judge was Qian Chengjun, Chief of the Criminal Division, with Judge Zhao Yongzhou and Gong Yuanbiao, Prosecutor Zhao Zhiqiu, and Clerk Yu Bi present. The verdict was announced in the first courtroom. The main text stated that the defendants were jointly convicted of murder and sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment each. The rationale was immediately stated, explaining that the prosecutor's indictment was changed to Article 282 of the law, which carries a maximum penalty of death and a minimum of ten years. However, since the case was aimed at maintaining local order, it was deemed excusable. According to Article 77, the sentence should be reduced by one degree to five years of imprisonment. However, due to legitimate defense, the sentence could be further reduced or dismissed. After deliberation by the court, it was decided to only reduce the sentence to two years and six months. The court determined that the act of ordering the firing of guns indicated an awareness of the possibility of causing death, which constitutes indefinite intent, but it was still considered intentional murder. However, your public power will remain unaffected because this is a public crime. If you disagree, you may appeal, but the hope for a beneficial outcome lies in arguing that it was either excessive self-defense or grounds for dismissal. On the other hand, if the appeal is unsuccessful, the judge might consider the reduction too lenient and increase the sentence. You and the others declared their intention to appeal, and You Bolu cried loudly in court. The lawyer immediately requested that bail be granted during the appeal period to alleviate suffering and allow the defendants to seek refuge for their families in Shanghai. After deliberation by the judge and prosecutor, temporary bail was approved, and the court adjourned.</p>

The new flags and armbands will be stamped with an oval-shaped Red Cross seal of the medical team for identification. It has been learned that the deadline for returning the old flags and armbands for replacement has been set for the 18th by the Association. All old flags and armbands that have not been returned by the deadline will be invalid.</p>

<p>Attention to Those Who Have Developed Madness from Shock</p>
<p>During the recent invasion of Shanghai by the violent Japanese forces, it has been reported that many compatriots in the affected areas have suffered excessive fear, leading to mental disorders and madness. We are now willing to donate our family's treasured Ma Bao medicine for treatment. Instructions for use will be provided with the medicine. However, the supply is limited and will be given out until exhausted. Those seeking the medicine should invite a neighbor to provide proof and take it away. Hoarding is discouraged to ensure fair distribution. The location for obtaining the medicine is Room of Feng Yu Trading Company, 2nd floor, No. 18 Bund, Standard Chartered Bank.</p>

<p>Washington D.C. US Secretary of State Stimson lodged a protest with Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, regarding the landing of Japanese troops in the Shanghai Public Concession. Debuchi visited the State Department today and had lengthy discussions. Reportedly, the Japanese Ambassador stated that the Japanese side is still striving to avoid a major war with the Chinese 19th Route Army.

<h3 id="e78">Present an Ultimatum <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Result of Consultation Between Araki and Yoshizawa</p>
<p>Tokyo According to reliable sources here, after consultations between Japanese Minister of War Araki and Foreign Minister Yoshizawa, it has been decided to instruct Lieutenant General Ueda, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces landing in Shanghai, to deliver an ultimatum to General Cai Tingkai, Commander of the Chinese 19th Route Army, within one or two days. The ultimatum will demand that the Chinese troops withdraw to a safe distance from Shanghai. If China refuses, two or three more divisions will be sent to Shanghai, so that a large force of four or five divisions can attack the Chinese troops in the Zhabei area of Shanghai. Furthermore, before meeting with Araki, Yoshizawa invited the ambassadors of the five countries of Great Britain, the United States, France, Germany, and Italy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explain that the dispatch of Japanese troops to Shanghai was solely for the purpose of protecting the Public Concession and the Japanese residents in the neighboring areas. He stated that unless the Chinese troops are willing to withdraw to a considerable distance from Shanghai to guarantee the safety of the Public Concession, the Japanese troops will have to take aggressive action.

<p>Japanese Minister of War Prepares</p>
<h3 id="e79">To Continue Sending Reinforcements to Shanghai <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo Minister of War Araki spoke of the possibility of continuing to send Japanese troops to Shanghai, saying, "We will send as many troops as needed, and they will be withdrawn as soon as their work is completed. This is my policy." Although political circles here are still hoping that the existing Japanese forces in Shanghai will be sufficient to drive back the 19th Route Army, there is a definite sense of anxiety. It is felt that there is a dilemma. If the Japanese forces fail due to insufficient numbers, the serious consequences cannot be ignored. However, continuing to send reinforcements would cause financial difficulties and increase the concerns of other countries, which would also be undesirable. At the same time, it is anticipated that a direct attack by the Japanese forces would inevitably subject the Public Concession to artillery fire, so a flanking maneuver will be carried out, cutting off the Chinese army's rear and forcing them to retreat on their own. (February 16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Tokyo The Minister of War stated in a speech to the representatives of the newspapers today that more reinforcements may still need to be sent to Shanghai, as it is reported that the 19th Route Army has been receiving a steady stream of reinforcements and is preparing to resist the Japanese forces. The Minister of War later visited Foreign Minister Yoshizawa and said that the decision on whether or not to send more reinforcements will depend on developments in the next few days.

<p>May Be Held Next Thursday</p>
<p>Geneva It is generally expected that a special meeting of the League of Nations Council will be convened and may be held here next Thursday. China has requested the convening of the Council to consider the Sino-Japanese conflict, with particular attention to the situation in Shanghai. There is no basis for the rumor that the Disarmament Conference will be temporarily suspended during the League of Nations Council meeting, as it is not difficult to hold the plenary sessions of the two bodies simultaneously. There are rumors that the United States may participate in the League of Nations Council, but US officials have denied this today. The League of Nations Administrative Council, consisting of twelve members besides the Chinese and Japanese representatives, met this afternoon and will probably meet again on the morning of Tuesday. (February 15th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Geneva This morning, the Twelve-Member Committee met, chaired by the French representative Paul-Boncour. He presented a letter from British Foreign Secretary Simon, informing the national representatives that the mediation efforts of Great Britain, France, the United States, and Italy regarding the dispute between China and Japan have yielded no results. The Administrative Council will likely convene on Thursday to express its views on China's request to convene a General Assembly of the League of Nations. In the meantime, the Twelve-Member Committee intends to make an urgent request to Japan to quickly cease hostilities. (February 16th, Havas News Agency)</p>

<p>Little Change in the Shanghai Situation</p>
<p>Peace Efforts Have Not Been Effective</p>
<p>London British Foreign Secretary Simon replied to several questions in the House of Commons today regarding the Far East situation, stating that the situation in Shanghai has not changed much in the recent days, except for the arrival of Japanese reinforcements. The British Minister to China, Knatchbull-Hugessen, has arrived in Shanghai and, in accordance with the instructions of the government, is mediating with both Chinese and Japanese authorities in every possible way, while also liaising with representatives of other countries, in the hope of achieving a ceasefire agreement. It is deeply regrettable that these efforts have not been effective, but they are continuing. China has invoked Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant and has submitted its request for a League of Nations meeting within the required deadline of the 14th. Therefore, if the Chinese representative wishes to submit the Sino-Japanese dispute to the Council, then the dispute must naturally be submitted to the Council. The report on the Shanghai incident has been collected by the Administrative Council as part of the information to be considered. Other parts of the information include the documents of both China and Japan, and the date of their publication will be determined by the Administrative Council. He advocated that these documents should be published as soon as possible. All members of the Administrative Council are aware of the seriousness and urgency of the situation. He hoped that there would be better news soon. As for when the League of Nations Council will convene and what action it will take after the meeting, these are issues that need to be carefully considered. The Administrative Council is currently meeting in Geneva. He hoped to return to Geneva soon. (February 15th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Geneva Swiss Federal Council President Dr. Motta, in his capacity as a representative attending the Disarmament Conference, strongly urged China and Japan this morning to resolve their disputes. His words were extremely sincere and moved the listeners. Dr. Motta made a speech at the Disarmament Conference, strongly urging the Chinese and Japanese representatives to cease hostilities. Otherwise, if the current situation in the Far East continues unabated, the Disarmament Conference will be overshadowed. It would be better to postpone the conference at this time. All members of the League of Nations and signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact have a solemn responsibility to respect international treaties. If treaties continue to be disregarded, the whole world will be plunged into chaos. He then discussed various disarmament proposals. Dr. Motta declared that Switzerland had no specific proposals, but would impartially consider all concrete proposals. As for the French proposal to establish an international army, the Swiss government considered it premature. Only when all major countries in the world have joined the League of Nations can it be expected to be realized. (February 16th, Guomin News Agency)</p>

<p>Nanjing Those traveling between Nanjing and Shanghai by boat described the difficulties they encountered on the river boats. The ships arriving here from Shanghai are now all anchored in the middle of the river, and passengers have to risk taking small boats to shore, charging 20 to 35 yuan per passenger. When the small boats approach the ship, passengers must tie a rope around their waist and ask the ship's crew to pull them up and down, charging 5 yuan each time. Once on the ship, even a place to stand requires a fee of 20 to 30 yuan, and the ships are extremely crowded. A reporter from a newspaper here who was sent to Shanghai to cover the Zhabei war has recently returned from Shanghai. The ship he was on was stopped in the middle of the river in Xiaguan. The ship's crew hired a small boat for him, charging 35 yuan, and then tied a rope to lower it to the small boat, charging another 15 yuan. However, the small boat was a little far from the deck of the river boat, and the rope was too short, so the reporter was suspended in mid-air and could not reach the small boat directly. At that time, the river tide was rising rapidly, and the reporter was so anxious that he shouted that he was willing to pay another 10 yuan. The ship's crew then found a way to help him, and he finally escaped the danger. The reporter claimed that the few minutes he spent hanging in mid-air were more dangerous than the days and nights he had spent on the battlefield. (February 16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Central National Government Holds in Luoyang</p>
<h3 id="e92">Second Commemorative Week <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Luoyang At 9:00 AM on the 15th, the central government and various agencies in Luoyang held the second expanded Commemorative Week. Present were Central Committee members Lin Sen, Ye Chucang, Qin Zhen, Shao Lizi, Wang Maogong, Zhou Qigang, Miao Peicheng, Li Ciwen, and more than 500 staff members of the central agencies. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Committee member Qin Zhen reported that in the past week, the struggle of unarmed comrades, the warm support of the people of the country for the central government, and the sympathy of the whole world for our people are all inspiring. Since the central government moved to Luoyang, not many central committee members have arrived in Luoyang, and few personnel from the various ministries and departments have come to Luoyang. The outside world has said that the central government's work is not tense, but in fact, the day the central government announced its move to Luoyang was the time for the total mobilization of the entire nation. Now that the total mobilization has begun, all comrades must work separately. Therefore, the tense work at this time is not in Luoyang, but in all directions. As for Luoyang, where the national government is located, the chairman, as the head of the country, is sitting here, and the actual administrative responsibilities of the country are still borne by the head of the executive government. Therefore, although the national government has moved to Luoyang, President Wang is still traveling on the road, working day and night. Military Committee members Jiang, Feng, Zhu, and Li are also planning day and night in all directions. At present, what is noticeable militarily seems to be only a corner of Shanghai, but in fact, the military planning is a total mobilization, and its tense situation may be unknown to the outside world. As for the personnel in Luoyang, although the number of people is small, they are all working as if one person is worth ten. Chairman Lin once said to me that our grand plan has been set, the work has been assigned, and it has been carried out separately. In any case, we will not sign a treaty that cedes power and humiliates the country. Our front has brave soldiers who will not be defeated, and our rear has calm and unhurried leaders. What else do we have to do? In the past week, in Shanghai, our army has won every battle. The number of Japanese soldiers has increased to more than 40,000, but the enemy troops have never succeeded in the end, according to military observers, our military deployments are effective, and increasing troops is not enough. In recent days, the Japanese army has also bombed our disaster relief shelters, causing an aversion of the people of the world and the Japanese people. The International Association, a gathering of world scholars, has advocated invoking Article 16 of the Covenant to sanction the violence. Students from Tokyo Imperial University in Japan also had anti-warlord demonstrations, showing that the sympathy of mankind has not died. We have the sympathy of the whole world outside and the people who unanimously support the central government and go to the national crisis together, the future is very bright. In Harbin, the morale of Binzhou has not been frustrated recently, and it is now launching a counterattack. In Guangzhou, the military expenses donated by merchants and civilians reached 5 million yuan, and 1 million yuan has been remitted to Shanghai, and a team of aircraft has flown to Shanghai to assist in the battle. Looking at the whole country, from Harbin to Guangdong, all are based on the fearless spirit of our Premier Sun and are doing everything possible to participate in this organized and planned total mobilization, to fight against the Japanese with the national and the world in mind. Our mission is great and tragic, but also very glorious. (February 16th, Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Xuzhou On the morning of the 15th, the Garrison Command convened all sectors to hold an expanded Commemorative Week and invited Chairman Wang. Wang and Chen Bijun attended the venue and gave a report. Wang said that at this time of national crisis, the national government moved to Luoyang to handle official business, and a declaration has been issued. Everyone must know that the world is not yet an era of justice, but an era of rights. Therefore, all countries cannot avoid national disasters, and they must always guard against national disasters, such as France, Germany, and Japan have all survived national disasters. Overcoming national disasters can lead to prosperity, and failing to overcome national disasters will lead to death. Japan prepared for Russia after the Sino-Japanese War, and prepared for us after the ninth year of the Republic, and they all endured and survived national disasters. Now, seeing the economic panic in various countries, they have no power to participate in the war, so they disregard everything and invade us. From this, we can know that our national disaster is by no means accidental. We must raise our hearts and face it together in order to overcome it. The only way is to resist and negotiate at the same time. Both weapons are used together. Those in office need not say soft words, and those in the wild need not sing high tunes. Our country has a vast territory and a large population. As long as we use it properly, we can of course win the final victory. Now, moving the country's total hub to the hinterland of Luoyang is to make it possible to be a place for resistance against Japan anywhere. Everyone resists everywhere. Even if Japan uses all of its 2.5 million troops, it will not be able to distribute them to China. We believe that the army still has times of defeat, but the people will never perish. Even if Japanese troops can defeat our army, they can never destroy our nation. Now the government is using the army as the last resort of resistance and diplomacy as the current response. Apart from this method, there is no other way. We can set a negotiation principle: sign treaties that do not cede power and humiliate the country, and do not sign treaties that cede power and humiliate the country. We hope that the people of the country will unite together, share the same aspirations with the government, and go to the national crisis together, then the final victory will surely be achieved.

We ask the central government to be their backing and not to yield to Japan. We are currently spreading propaganda and will do our best to help. The Chinese Association.</p>

Our association remitted 2,000 yuan through the Mercantile Bank on the 9th of this month and another 3,000 yuan on the 12th to General Chen Mingshu to be used as war expenses for General Cai in Shanghai. Please reply by telegram immediately after receipt so that we can continue to remit funds. National Salvation Association.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan for the attention of all newspapers: Premier Wang's telegram to Mayor Wu of Shanghai is as follows: Mayor Wu of Shanghai, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, we have repeatedly received telegrams from various people's organizations urging us to send reinforcements to Songhu. We have replied that the government is responsible for the garrisoning of Songhu and will never allow its isolated army to be without support. However, the situation is serious, and plans cannot be announced. Those who send telegrams urging reinforcements are still incessant, and some even criticize the government. Their enthusiasm is commendable, but it is regrettable that they lack common sense. Consider the Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 14th, which stated that since the Kanazawa 9th Division arrived in Shanghai, the authorities have lifted the ban on newspapers publishing troop movements, but the exact number of troops sent to Shanghai has not yet been announced. The enemy's military operations are so strict, while our side is so clamorous. How can we not be saddened? Please convey this message to all organizations and newspapers. Wang Zhaoming. Secretariat of the Executive Yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Situation in Japan After the Shanghai Incident <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>(Compiled and translated from Japanese newspapers) (Continued from the fourth installment)</p>
<p>Trade: As mentioned above, imports in January of this year exceeded 45,322,200 yuan. Due to the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations, exports to China, the largest target, decreased by 18,940,000 yuan compared to the same month last year. The major export items affected were raw silk, cotton fabrics, silk fabrics, and refined sugar. Furthermore, the amount of exports to China in the Showa 6th year (1931) decreased by more than 96,500,000 yuan compared to the Showa 5th year (1930), which was the lowest record since the Showa 1st year (1926). Not only did exports decrease, but imports from China also decreased by 25%. Originally, China was the only market for Japan. In addition to the aforementioned raw silk, cotton fabrics, silk fabrics, and refined sugar, Japanese goods such as paper, coal, machinery, cement, hats, glass products, umbrellas, and other miscellaneous goods were also exported in large quantities. These goods had already been severely impacted by the Manchurian Incident. Now, with the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, it is easy to imagine the suffering endured by regular businesses. For example, sugar factories in Osaka and the Datong Sugar Factory in Dalian have successively closed down. Next is cement. Japan relied heavily on French Indochina, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. Since the Manchurian Incident, exports have decreased by 50%. Now, exports to Shanghai have also been completely cut off. Trade in Japanese cement to China has completely stopped. Next is paper, with an annual value of approximately 22 million yuan, of which 60% was exported to China, with Shanghai alone accounting for 40%. Coal exports are 8 million yuan per year, entirely to Shanghai, which has also been cut off. Other items such as umbrellas and toys are in a desperate situation. Exports have been cut off. Small and medium-sized businesses in Osaka and Kobe are also in a desperate situation regarding aquatic products, ceramics, hats, umbrellas, and toys. Since exports are impossible, raw materials such as wool, leather, bran, sesame, cottonseed, and rapeseed, which they relied on Shanghai for supply, are also impossible to purchase, leading to unemployment in the leather industry and decline in agricultural production. It is estimated that no fewer than one million people have lost their jobs due to indirect impacts. This is truly a major crisis for Japan. According to the announcement by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, from February 1st to 10th, the total amount of foreign trade through Japan's sixteen major ports was 25,405,000 yuan in exports and 44,583,000 yuan in imports. Imports exceeded exports by 19,178,000 yuan. The reason for the excess of imports is the lack of domestic goods. The reason for the decrease in exports is the impact of the Shanghai Incident. Furthermore, with the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, ports in North and South China also became indirectly unable to import, and sales were sluggish. The sluggishness of trade in the first ten days of February is truly in an unprecedentedly tragic situation. The amount of exports and imports exceeding each other at the sixteen ports is recorded below: "Yokohama import excess 1,737, Kobe 7,965, Osaka 5.12, Nagasaki 591, Moji 763, Hakodate 54, Nagoya 2,389, Yokkaichi 443, Shimizu 471, Kagoshima 159, Kokura 401, Wakamatsu 400, Takefu 226, Onomichi Kure 60, Tokuyama 242, Shimonoseki equal exports and imports, Tokuyama and Takefu have no exports."</p>
<p>Ideology: Since the influence of the Russian Revolution, democratic, socialist, and communist ideologies have flourished in Japan for the past ten years. There has been a growing trend of dissatisfaction with the government. Opposition to the government has been especially strong in academic and labor circles, as those groups directly experience material and spiritual suffering, and have repeatedly attempted to overthrow the political system. However, the government's defenses are very strict, and there is no way to vent these feelings. On February 11th, for the National Foundation Day commemorating the ascension of Emperor Jimmu, the Tokyo Imperial University Student Association suddenly held a student rally in front of the corridor on the campus of Tokyo Imperial University at 10:00 AM on the 10th. When the classes dismissed, more than a thousand students from all levels gathered in lecture hall number 11 on the third floor. They wrote slogans such as "Overthrow the Patriotic Student Alliance," "Down with National Foundation Day," "Absolutely Oppose Imperialist War," and "Reduce Tuition by 80 Yuan" on paper about one zhang long, making large banners, which they flew outside. They also distributed numerous red and white leaflets from the windows and roof. Many students successively gave speeches. After the meeting, just as they were about to form a procession to demonstrate, the chief of the Hongō Ward Fuji Police Station and Inspector Inamura, along with a hundred police officers, rushed to the scene in automobiles, accompanied by police officers from the Sakamoto and Kikuya police stations. They immediately surrounded the student group on all sides, leading to a major conflict with the student group. Dozens of people were injured on the spot, and more than twenty people were arrested by the police officers, who also dispersed the crowd (excerpt from the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun). Furthermore, a student strike also occurred at the Osaka Higher Commercial School a few days ago, and similar incidents are heard of in other places from time to time. This is enough to show the instability of the thoughts of the Japanese intellectual class.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Jiang, Wang, and Feng Meet in Xuzhou <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Wang Expresses Great Optimism about Diplomacy</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Due to the urgency of diplomacy and the unresolved Shanghai Incident, Executive Yuan Premier Wang Zhaoming telegraphed Military Affairs Committee Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to come to Xuzhou to discuss major diplomatic and military plans. After receiving the telegram in Kaifeng, Chiang, accompanied by his wife Song Meiling and a small number of staff and attendants, took a special train of seven cars east on the 11th at noon, passing Guide at 6:00 PM and arriving at the North Station of Xuzhou at 10:00 PM. Chiang rested on the train because it was late. Wang's special train of fourteen cars arrived from Pukou North at 9:40 PM on the 11th, with Feng Yuxiang, Li Jishen, Zhu Peide, Bao Wenwei (Zhang Xueliang's representative), Yang Aiyuan (Yan Xishan and Zhao Pilian's representative), Chen Bijun, and Zeng Zhongming. They arrived at East Station on the morning of the 12th. Military music was played loudly at the station, and those who came to greet him raised their hands in salute. Wang returned the salute and briefly told the reporters that after arriving in Pukou a few days ago, he felt that the diplomatic situation was better, so he crossed the river to Nanjing to discuss everything with Military and Political Minister He Yingqin, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, and Finance Minister Song Ziwen. He expressed great optimism about diplomacy and said that although the Shanghai war had been fierce for days and the situation in Nanjing was serious, China had fully accepted the conditions proposed by various countries, and the wrong was on the Japanese side, while China was in the right. Wang then learned that Chiang was waiting for news at the North Station, so he ordered the train to start again. At 9:30 AM, he arrived at the North Station. Chiang saw Wang's train arriving and boarded Wang's train to meet with Wang, Feng, Li, Zhu, and others for about two hours. The content could not be ascertained. After the meeting, Chiang returned to his car for lunch, while Wang planned to send a telegram to the foreign affairs, military affairs, and finance departments in Nanjing, asking them to work hard. Chiang, Wang, and Li also sent a telegram in the name of the Military Affairs Committee to various dignitaries, inviting them to come to Xuzhou to attend the following meeting. Both telegrams were sent on the same day. The meeting place has been designated as the Garden Hotel. It is said that the meeting will be held after the dignitaries arrive in Xuzhou. (12th)</p>
