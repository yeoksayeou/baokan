<h3>反對鴉片公賣彬</h3>
<p>鴉片公賣之聲浪邇歲以來再接再厲去歲禁烟委員會劉瑞恒伍連德等藉口寓禁於徵曾聳恿政府起用前主辦兩湖鴉片特稅之李鴻基組設禁烟查緝處一度實行嗣以各方反對及自動取消邇近乘外侮方亟人民努力救亡之時而鴉片公賣遂復於國人不知不覺中秘密進行華北冀熱察綏諸省都己實行尙有數省亦正在策劃之中河北自實行公賣以後平津間每日收入特稅四五萬元熱平間每日且多至十二萬元而張學良則猶極力掩飾謂爲訛傳監察委員高友唐彈劾劉瑞恒更謂其「默認種烟運烟賣烟爲個人生財機會利用職權公開賣烟各國之譏誚在所勿聞人民之健康在所勿計禍國殃民莫此爲甚」由是可知公賣之舉今己實際復活爲國本計爲民生計爲民族前途計吾人對於此種禍國殃民根本滅絶我民族之喪心病狂之舉措感想又將如何</p>
<p>夫鴉片流毒盡人皆知即三尺童子亦知其毒於洪水猛獸爲人類之大敵文明國家絶不容有其踪跡我國受此惡魔之吸吮呑噬今垂百年鴉片之戰即爲不平等條約之肇端奇恥大辱凡屬血氣之倫今固尙未容健忘然而百年以來毒流愈廣基植愈深人民瀹爲地獄中之殭尸不知幾何民國初年雖曾一度嚴禁但不久軍閥當國禁乃復弛自茲以後遂徒有禁烟之名而無禁烟之寳甚旦烟以禁而銷路愈暢特稅之收入愈鉅而烟之產量亦愈多寖至若干省勒種勒銷包運包販視此爲固定之稅收軍閥官僚尤視此爲肥私囊之大利即胥更走卒亦視此爲恫嚇敲詐生財之大道於是所謂禁烟乃恰爲一種推廣手段二十年來毫無二式於是而民淪惡道國苦貧窮其所以召致今日之國難原因雖多而烟毒流行我民族日自戕殺而不自覺致奄奄一息不能自振要亦其根因之一</p>
<p>今持鴉片公賣之說者不日寓禁於徵乎不曰爲國家闢財源乎所謂寓禁於徵純爲自欺欺人之談己根本不值一駁至於所謂爲國家闢財源則更飲鴆止渴剜肉醫瘡計目前之小利而予民族以致命之打擊爲禍國殃民之謬論夫地皆種烟農事都廢生產日减毒物日增多數人民槪成廢人是不僅爲斵喪我國民經濟之利斧抑且爲滅我種族之毒劑再數十年後我國内不僅無播種農產之地卽人民抑且將不存噍類但求目前能榨取人民之膏血以飽私囊則數十年後亡國滅種亦所不恤秉國鈞者果己注意及此耶</p>
<p>吾人對此亡國滅種鴉片公賣之陰謀不得不提出嚴厲之抗議並表示堅决之反對</p>
<h3>日政黨對軍部屈服</h3>
<p>鈴木與荒木成立諒解將組織所謂國民政府外交改變面目在意中</p>
<p>自日首相犬養氏暗殺後、世界輿論、均懼日軍人派之抬頭、國際風雲之變色、英報謂滿洲問題、將益趨緊急、俄報則謂將大增遠東戰事之危機、更有人謂日美戰爭之機會、愈益迫近、今日内閣之改組、雖未確定、但政友會己容納軍人派之意見、將來日閣縱以鈴木爲班首、不過徒具虛名、實權必握於軍人之手、己顯然可見、此其事之關係世界命運實非淺細、茲彙錄各電如左</p>
<h3>鈴木組閣呼聲</h3>
<p>向軍部奔走諒解結果將組織舉國一致内閣</p>
<p>電通十八日東京電關於後繼内閣、鈴木政友會總裁與荒木陸相之間、己於本日成立組織舉國一致内閣之諒解、以鈴本總裁爲首相、網羅民政黨及各方面之人才、豫料二十日前後、組閣大命將降於鈴木總裁、新内閣之新外相、以現滿鐵總裁内田康哉伯爲最有力、惟荒木陸相本日在陸相官邸開軍部最高幹部會議時、己正式表明、縱令成立舉國一致内閣、本人决不留任、並推薦眞崎參謀次長爲後任陸相、</p>
<p>電通社十八日東京電荒木陸相於今日下午四時、在首相官邸與鈴木總裁·森秘書長鼎足而坐、正式會談組織恊力内閣、經交換意見後、荒本陸相似己諒解、五時五分會畢、會談之内容大要如下、荒木陸相謂予個人並不以政黨政治爲不善、若由年輕者視之、今日之政黨其所行政治、似非一般人所首肯、今次係非常時之内閣、則組織舉國一致之内閣爲何如、鈴木總裁謂、現己分裂之政黨欲謀一致、似覺不可能、故於今予並不考慮協力内閣與聨立内閣、但不惜羅致適當人材云、當會見後、鈴木總裁謂、予以爲第一係救濟農村、第二係充實國防、第三係善導思想、第四條正義之外交、聨立内閣設能成立、但必致分裂　故有合政友本會加入組閣、固所歡迎、擬組織一協力内閣、想軍部方面或能容納也云云、</p>
<p>電通十八日東京電鈴木内相對强硬反對政友會之單獨内閣力主組舉國一致内閣之軍部、努力要求諒解、派人向陸相極力疏通、陸相則答以希望實現强有力之内閣、能根本改革現在政治經濟機構者、此乃軍部之意嚮、不能動摇、若置諸不理、難保不再發生重大之不祥事件、余之進退、亦由此大勢决之、深望内相對於此點、加以深甚之考慮、故鈴木内相之組閣、斷難蔑視此軍部之意嚮、明晚西園寺公入京後之政局、將如何變化、未可逆覩</p>
<p>電通十八日東京電鈴木政友會總裁對軍部方面之意嚮、與以考慮、昨日午後又派森書記官長訪荒木陸相、疏通意見、荒木陸相復由某氏非公式表示强硬之態度、謂軍部尤以青年將校中不滿現在政黨、希望根本改革政治機構者甚多、請鈴木總裁充分考慮云、鈴木内相關於此事語人曰、軍部方面之意嚮、旣相當强硬、此時若誤一步、必致牽動全局、故余對此、正與以深甚之考慮、然與本人雖在今日仍以政黨爲基礎之單一内閣爲理想、此次旣就任總裁、必行政黨之凈化、與衆共覩云</p>
<h3>軍部入閣條件</h3>
<p>網羅黨外英才一掃黨政積弊</p>
<p>以福利農民爲揭</p>
<p>華聨社十八日東京電日本陸軍今日開三長官會議於陸軍省、到會者爲眞崎參謀次長·武籐敎育總監·及荒木陸相、磋商對後任内閣陸軍應取之態度、聞以下列條件支持鈴木組織舉國一致之内閣（一）集黨外英才、組織舉國一致之内閣、（二）鈴木總裁與軍部之私約、須公布於天下、以保證其實行、（三）提出新政策要求、要求政府實行其新政策、（一）修改現在之資本主義各種失當之制度、（二）廢除政黨政治之弊害（三）改造農村、保障農民之生活、（四）實行各種社會政策、採用軍部之强硬外交政策、</p>
<p>路透十八日東京電日本軍界對於農民及小資本商人之表示同情、及大衆威信减輕農區經濟困難、實爲當務之急、此二端似將於决定新内閣中佔重要部分、路透訪員曾訪問消息靈通者、據稱、軍界尙未切實拒絶加入新内閣、惟力主組織國民政府、且由此方面探悉軍界己允推舉陸相、加入鈴木所將組織之政友會内閣、惟須政府担人保贊助軍界之政綱、其中有改變稅制、而求救濟農民、並許農民與小資本商人所借之債展期債還、</p>
<p>電通社十八日東京電日本陸軍方面今日上午十一時在陸相官邸開三長官會議、討論軍部對組織後任内閣之態度、後乃决定條件如下、一掃政治政黨之弊、收羅有爲人材入閣、協力實行内閣下之國家本位政策、故即以鈴木總裁爲内閣之主、亦附有上述條件、軍部方面似己意見一致、</p>
<p>電通十八日東京電陸軍方面一俟後任總理决定將提出重大條件、現正於秘密之裏研究條件、及表示意見之方法、聞陸軍方面對後任首相所要求之條件、其根幹爲新内閣構成、必爲舉國一致内閣、非以眞純之國家本位進行、排除黨略政策之全部不可、苟新内閣不容納此根幹條件、則陸軍方面拒絶入閣、</p>
<p>路透十八日東京電據消息靈通者稱、日陸軍尙未明白拒絶參加新内閣、惟刻正力爭組織無黨派之超然内閣、若新任政友會總裁鈴木氏出而組閣、日陸軍願推舉陸相、惟須以政府担任贊助陸軍之政綱爲條件、聞此項政綱、包括改變現有稅制、籍謀農人之福利、并對於農民及小資本商人所負之債務、主張展期償還、蓋日陸軍以同情於農民及小商人爲號召、且認救濟農村經濟困難爲最重要也、組閣呼聲中之鈴木、在日政界中素稱有力份子、與國家主義之國本社領袖平沼·荒木·等關係頗深、</p>
<p>東京政變</p>
<h3>益增遠東戰機</h3>
<p>俄赤軍參謀長播音演說</p>
<p>國民社十八日募斯科電蘇俄赤衛軍參謀長阿伐洛夫將軍就無線電演說、廣播全國、謂東京事變恐將太增遠東戰爭之危機、阿氏並追溯日相犬養毅與法總統杜美爾之被剌、謂出於同一根源、其動機俱由於痛恨蘇俄而起、犬養毅不主張在滿行使排俄政策、故若輩决意除之、以便實行其排俄政策、此案内幕係具有偉大勢力者所佈置、是以甚可焦憂、前以犬養毅之强有力手腕、阻止日軍官向蘇俄邊境冒險猛進、今則此强有力手腕、己隨犬養毅之慘死而同去、我人唯有獨自防衛而己、又謂此日紅軍司令當密切觀養一切發展、而赤色外交家當盡力謀與日本新政府獲得諒解、最後則稱、雖然欲與日本軍閥諒解、顯屬不可能事、今後數星期内當可見最後控制滿洲者、究屬軍人抑爲外交家也</p>
<h3>日本軍閥當政</h3>
<p>足以危害世界和平</p>
<p>倫敦人士表示疑懼</p>
<p>路透社十八日倫敦電日本政變之結果、與其及於遠東時局之反響、甚滋倫敦人士之疑懼、各政黨現皆談論此事、保守黨豫料軍人控制日本内閣後、對滿政策將更進一步、距正式併呑、相去僅一髮耳、工黨則推料「國民政府」之危險、深信此或將爲假面具之軍从迭克推多制、而足危害世界之和平、一般人士皆承認日本陸海軍對於上海之撤軍、仍憤懣填膺、彼等因此或將在滿洲取强硬之態度、而不顧蘇俄可能的反對、</p>
<p>國民社十七日柏林電遠東事變己使柏林交易所受不利之影響、今晨各業開市、大都堅定、嗣以遠東將有戰事可能之謡諑、信者漸衆、各種市價迅即跌落、遂成起落不定之象、至收盤時仍有下跌趨向、</p>
<h3>老公今日進京</h3>
<p>聽取重臣意見</p>
<p>决定後繼内閣</p>
<p>日聨十八日東京電西園寺公秘書原田日前來京、聽取各方面之意見、今晨八時離京返興津、向老公報告一切、西園寺公準備明日赴京、</p>
<p>電通十八日東京電西園寺己决定十九日午後一時由靜岡驛發、午後四時五十五分抵東京驛、鑑於時局之重大、入京後之西園寺公先與鈴木待從長·牧野内府·倉富樞府議長·清浦奎吾等重臣重要會談、並探悉軍部之意響、俟得以協力一致内閣能善處時局之確信、即奏請以鈴木總裁組織後繼内閣、鈴木總裁當即着手組閣</p>
<h3>民政黨之軟化</h3>
<p>居然贊助國民内閣</p>
<p>電通社十八日東京電關於後繼内閣問題、民政黨方面當安本主照濱口總理遭難當時之前例、希望成立多數黨之政友内閣、至於昨日、一變而傾向舉國一致内閣、謂當此國家非常之時、政友會之單獨内閣、萬難應付時局、須組織以政民兩派爲基礎之舉國内閣、昨夜　田首席總務·川崎卓吉·永井幹事長等、集於日本俱樂部協議之後、本日再徵詢若槻總裁之意響、然後進行準備云、民政黨傾向舉國内閣、與時局前途以重大暗示、其進展極堪重視、</p>

<h3>大阪每日新聞論</h3>
<p>日美戰機切迫</p>
<p>此文先論美國在太平洋作戰之困難、一因海軍士氣之不旺、二因艦隊力量之不厚、三因艦隊調集聨絡之不易、大有不堪一擊之意、次論美國舉行海軍大演習、實係對日挑戰行動、而對美變更預定計劃、將艦隊無限期留駐於太平洋上、尤爲日人所不能容忍、日美間關係之危險、觀此文可見一斑矣</p>
<p>大阪每日新聞於本月十二日發表池崎忠孝氏論文、題爲「宿命的日美戰爭、」其文甚長、茲迻譯如下、</p>
<p>據四月十四日華盛頓電訊、美國舉行太平洋海軍大演習、凡美國所有艦隊、一律參加、同時美國國務院、預定大演習終後、由大西洋出動之偵察艦隊、無期限的警備於太平洋方面、業將此意、徵詢海軍當局、海軍當局雖尙未正式下令施行、然己在準備之中、查此次美國海軍大演習、係歸史戈飛爾特上將所統率、即照二月六日以美國太平洋沿岸與檀香山羣島爲中心、舉行全美合衆國艦隊大演習之意、故其規模之雄大、實較一九二五年所舉行之海軍大會操、尤爲壯烈、又據紐約時報載、演習之繼續期間、自二月六日起直至五月十三日、竟逹九十七日之長時期、其間又分爲三期、第一期自二月六日至同月十一日、參加者爲太平洋岸戰鬥艦隊與檀香山駐屯之陸軍部隊、以檀香山爲中心、實行陸海軍共同攻防演習、第二期自三月八日起至同月二十三日、自檀香山方面進發之戰鬥艦隊、向美國西海岸前進、獲得一根據地、三月八日以後、預定抵舊金山及溫哥華間海面之偵察艦隊、演習抵抗的實戰、第三期自三月二十三日起至五月十三日、就第二期之演目終後、合併戰鬥偵察兩艦隊、在舊金山温哥華海洋上、舉行艦隊的集結運動、以及各種戰技訓練、按照預定計畫、參加大演習時、全美合衆國艦隊之大西洋部隊中偵察艦隊、由維特中將統率、亦在大西洋各根據地解纜、寄港於美國海軍之冬季根據地古巴的庚太奈、實行射擊演習、至三月初旬、復與本隊分别而取他種行動的航空戰隊及驅逐艦隊、集合於太平洋沿岸之根據地溫哥華軍港、</p>
<p>但照四月十四日所發之電報、似己變更預定計畫、三期演習己告結束、但其突然縮短大演習之實施期間、究含有何種作用、未敢臆測、微聞舉行此大演習時、有多數海員、均以爲將與日本開戰、頗爲危懼、致合衆國艦隊中、竟有一千五百名艦員逃亡、又在檀香山繫留之戰鬥艦隊、因該地上陸之水兵、發生不名譽案件、引起禁止上陸問題、由此點觀之、美國艦隊士氣之不旺盛、己難諱言、今余（池崎）急欲指摘者、美國國務院突然聲明大演習後、由大西洋出動之偵察艦隊、無期限的防備大平洋一點、即美國爲政略上及軍事上之見地而發生、美國此舉、究竟具有何意、余亦不敢臆斷、但此問題、吾國人實受重大剌激、故就余所見、略述如左、考現今美國之海軍編制、按照海軍卿所公表一九三一年度之報告、美國艦隊、可分爲二·一爲常備於太平洋之戰　艦隊、一爲防備於大西洋之偵察艦隊、構成偵察艦隊内容之戰隊、又分爲巡洋艦隊·水雷戰隊·航空戰隊·及練習戰隊等四組、而此等戰隊之寳勢力、關於最近建造之一萬噸級巡洋艦·七千五百噸級輕巡洋艦·以及各種優秀艦、均包括於巡洋艦隊之中、假使偵察艦隊除外、推想合衆國艦隊之實勢力、亦不甚厚、且美國海軍、平日分配於東西兩大洋、一旦有事、恐亦不能迅还調集、則在太平洋上作戰、己成爲極困難的問題、徵諸過去的體騐、由大西洋沿岸之根據地哈姆勃登羅士與却爾士登、欲航行至近於東部太平洋沿岸之根據地舊金山温哥華、須需二十日以上之日期、則至戰爭勃發時、恐一時不能由大西洋接應太平洋、且阻當大西洋部隊進路者、有巴拿馬危險地帶、該地帶原爲美國海軍之大障碍、縱令巴拿馬運河之轟炸成功、欲以太平洋艦隊聨合大西洋部隊、亦不得不經過航程一萬五千海里之凱蒲烘、迂回航路、由此又可證明美國海軍行動之滯澀、影響軍事的進行、目下常備於太平洋沿岸之戰鬥艦隊、有新墨西哥·密西細比·曁亞火呵等三戰艦、今爲改裝艦體、正在諾福克與斐拉德羅非的海軍工廠修繕、舊艦阿康沙司、本爲練習艦、己編入於大西洋部隊中、該艦隊中有十一隻戰艦爲主體、屬於第一線戰艦、僅有二隻航空母艦、與八隻輕巡洋艦、以及其他若干之驅逐艦潛水艦而己、</p>
<p>如是在太平洋作戰之根本觀念美國海軍勢力之薄弱、己爲不可掩之事實、此次海軍大演習、完全屬於偵察艦隊、但美國政府突然計畫以無期限的防備於太平洋者、實爲破天荒之舉、吾人推測彼之心中、必以爲太平洋將發生事故、或將釀成事故於太平洋、故以此舉動、威嚇當面敵手的策略、蓋美國政府所表示之行動、己踰出常軌、而舉行海軍大演習、尤爲踰越常軌之行動也、（未完）</p>

<p>東京報知新聞云、芳澤外相自得前駐俄大使田中都吉氏赴滿視察返國詳細報告後、鑒於極東形勢之惡化、急欲變更對俄政策、以避免北滿之不安、目下爲確立對俄方針、政府内部有力者之意見、分兩種應付方法、（一）對俄互不侵犯條約問題、在此種政治間題未解决以前、主張先樹立對俄經濟政策、但對俄經濟問題、則採漸進主義、現在仍以靜觀態度處置之、（二）一般的對俄方針、政府對於兩國間的誤會、力謀消除誤解原因、改善兩國間之國交、（按當今日本之對敵爲俄美二國、自俄國集中大軍於北滿國境、日俄形勢、頓呈險惡、但日本國内反美空氣、較反俄爲甚、若欲與美開釁、不得不緩和俄國、此變更對俄政策、即爲積極反美之準備也、）</p>

<p>從借毯子起、童子軍就擴大服務範圍、向戰地出發、一月三十日、理事會辦的敎練　與慕爾堂的二百七十團童子軍、開始活躍、並招請了自願投軍的六百多人、成立了「戰地服務團、」舉出汪剛爲總指揮·希雪樵·羅烈·王亦樵和女童軍黃汕爲副、又推定組織處主任俞菊廬、總務處主任陳濤、文書處主任朱家讓、宣傳處主任何嘉、救護隊隊長倪家璽、　勞隊隊長馮振威、浩浩蕩蕩的氣呑河山、爲祖國爭生存去了、</p>
<p>他們的救護工作、在閘北最前綫救出了七百多如失水鱗如待决死囚的同胞、在後方辦了十三個難民收容所、同時服役於其他二十餘的收容所及傷兵醫院、專門管理警備事宜、十九路軍的車輛出入和慰勞品的整理、也靠了他們、秩序井然、</p>
<p>戰事正烈時、前方缺少傳訉的人員、童子軍方面馬上挑選善於駕駛技能的十二人、組成「前方傳訉隊」由倪家璽帶領、趨眞茹總指揮部交通處傳遞重要公文、他們出入於烽火瀰漫中、毫無畏葸悸懼之心、飛機在頭頂上翺翔盤旋的追蹤、砲聲隆隆、槍彈矢矢的上下左右震驚的飛過、從没躭誤過公事、總指挥蔣光鼐軍長蔡廷楷眼看他們如此的忠勇、成績如此的優良、都拍案讚嘆、要求童子軍往南翔總指揮部服勞、汪剛添派了二十五人請馮振威率領、幹那人家不願幹不敢幹的工作</p>
<h3>中央大學醫學院大半己被燬</h3>
<p>迨我軍守第二道防綫、童子軍設的收容所次第結束、餘下來的童軍及二百七十新團員、由汪剛趙慰祖等訓練、敎習戰地技能、　　成了第三批前方服務人員、繞道赴崑山十九路總指揮部交通處處長唐德煌訓話後、即加入先來的第一二批童子軍共同築路·監工·架橋·偵查·運輪·招待·通訉各事、崑山到常熟的電杆木和電綫的裝置、都出自他們之手、聽說他們於一星期内完全這工作、蘇州城墻一圈的掘壕挖洞、他們與馮大義勇軍和骷髏隊合作、今則留給童軍獨任了、他們通訉和偵查的地帶、名容南京以及滬寗滬杭路上、都踏有不少的踪跡、他們常駐的地方爲蘇州松江·正義·崑山·無錫·南翔·眞茹、「童子軍隨軍辦事處」是他們的指揮部、也是發號施令的總機關、市商會第五十團童子軍應單獨進行、他們功積也很多、可惜流彈死了幾個同志、這幾個同志姓名尙未探得、我們該爲溘然長逝者靜默追悼</p>
<p>國聨調查團到京、主席李頓爵士什縻都没有幹、第一件事就在勵志社召集童子軍訓話、中國的要人不免有些驚訝、原來李頓是童子軍鼻祖、貝登堡的學生、貝登堡知道中國童子軍在强鄰壓迫之下辛勤奮勉、親自冩信嘉奬慰勞、李頓到華眼鑡中國童子出乎他理想的優越、自然先要和忠勇的親愛的童子軍　談了、這次敵人的童子軍在滬亦很活動、四月底己受海軍司令召集了嘉勉并贈紀念品、我國童子軍爲國如此出力之後、政府社會對他不知有甚表示、固然童子軍的服役、原不在討人家的表示呀</p>

<h3>金融金價回好四兩</h3>
<p>市態安謐之至昨標金狀况、頗爲和平、終日僅計四兩數錢廻顧、復己穿出七百兩以上、統核趨漲四兩左右、初即見漲、雖大條續升、銀價適反回跌所致、往後略有進退、至外匯勢似緊張、惟後市因逢週三無市、殆金價尤爲平庸、微跌而己、各方交易、亦屬稀少、人心則平、茲將一日間經過情况錄后、</p>
<h3>破出七百兩關</h3>
<p>自早七月份開盤即加四兩半、爲七百零二兩半、英銀仍升八分之一、美銀跌去四分之一、私電亦然、市况報平、繼因同昌恒餘大德成志豐永等買進、又加一兩、爲零三兩半、志豐永復出、退至零二兩二錢、俄而元亨乾昌祥丙興等來購又以華銀行吸六月美金三十一元半、麥行吸現期四三七五、又八月英金六二五、乃價回上二兩餘、九點二十餘分爲零四兩八錢、此時散戸等吐出、當孫一兩二三錢、英金開出己縮一檔、美金三七五、遂爲零四兩半、旋後有一兩六七錢起仆、大連帮售出志豐永則進、至内部平定、孟買來出五月英金一八半、遠期可結一八六二五、直至十點半後因元茂永元大永順利萬興源泰等前來脫手兼之美金九月份三十二元零六二五出入均可、八月份由三井出八七五、乃金價一瀉四兩、十一點零爲七百兩零零五錢、入後義豐永福太亨福餘買進、故又拉上二兩餘、十一點三刻爲零三兩二錢、未幾時恒餘日昌等賣出、遂即貶去一兩零、至午收零一兩九錢、揭價改爲七百七十七兩計撳七十三兩至七十五六兩、</p>
<h3>後市平庸無特變後市開盤零一</h3>

<p>市塲槪况昨日洋釐銀拆市况、形勢比較前日氣象大爲增色、而晨間交易亦頗景氣、午市雖未興盛、神氣亦佳、結果兩市間釐價加昻七毫半、而銀拆亦好五分、可見市氣漸臻俏象也、</p>
<p>釐拆價格「洋釐」早市洋釐價較前日加昻半釐、爲七錢零一釐半、午市又好二毫半、爲七錢零一釐七毫半、結果較前日共好七毫半「銀拆」早市及午市同爲一錢、較前日加昻五分、銀行掛牌亦有四分行市、劃頭加水一錢二三分銀欵頭襯甚爲充裕、而需用較廣、是以亦有充滿之好氣象也</p>

<p>成交約三百六十萬元</p>
<p>昨（十八日）華商證劵交易所各債市况、現貨成交無多、全日僅開出四萬四千元、期市續旺、全日買賣人氣大致仍屬活潑、計上午成交一百九十萬、後市亦有一百六十餘萬元、合計三百五十六萬元、中統稅七十二萬、鹽稅五十四萬、其他各約四十萬、關稅編遣續清、整六仍無市、至言各債劵價之趨勢、在晨初以市上人心較虛賣方交易較買進爲旺、故價依然傾疲、計各小半元左右不等、次盤雖略堅、上落仍微、趨勢疲滯如故、後市情形己有轉機、零戸乘低收進、買方人氣反比賣出爲旺、於是各價一致回堅、但趨勢尙平和、結果較前日互有漲跌、内現貨及關稅·編遣·裁兵等期貨均續跌、餘一致比前日回漲五六角左右云、</p>

<h3>紐約股市無大變化</h3>
<p>美東銀公司報告</p>
<p>週二市面、人心轉趨冷淡、開市時價格摇曳不定、但後來賣戸漸稀、致各項證劵均報漲起、迨至收市時、重復下跌、昨日經濟界無特殊消息、僅有國會議員卡拿氏之談話、確料美國國會、今夏將有長時期之聚集、市價之終於下跌、或即因此、週二實業股最爲堅挺、收盤價仍較前日漲起數分、個中領袖股劵、均有進步、鐵道及公用、受同度之壓迫、結果亦相埒、公債行市、隨股劵亦步亦趨、據道瓊斯報告、四十種公債之平均價、爲七二·六二、計跌○·一二磅音、附道瓊斯每日指數如左、</p>

<h3>紗市虛弱</h3>
<p>棉紗市情異常散澹毫無精彩可言、有一部份觀跌因廣東時局急轉、日本風潮未全息、有此種種原因、紗市處於四面楚歌中、何能有生氣所以多數人皆抱抛賣主義、幸底盤己枯雖有重大不利消息傳來市面跌風程度尙淺但實銷亦告清疲市氣殊難轉機也、</p>

<h3>棉市跌後稍回</h3>
<p>棉市始跌繼回趨勢仍弱、以美棉又趨下游、而印度敎潮劇烈暴動現己延至紗廠區域、間有紗廠二十家停工於是有一部份預料印棉有下落之虞惟一般業外者以本埠存貨太少、心氣看高但世界棉業狀况依然衰弱不振云、</p>

<p>較上年見低十八兩</p>
<p>昨日温州來路莊之新紅茶、己由怡和洋行開出頭盤三十一兩二錢五分、較上年見低十八兩祁門盤三十一兩二錢五分、較上年見低十八兩仍未做開、蓋以日來國外銀價繼續趨長、英茶商有進意、因之市益挺俏、至路莊土莊兩路之珍眉綠茶、昨日亦無大宗交易、路莊遂安茶、市盤又跌十餘兩、情勢頗爲不利云、</p>
<h3>婺源抽芯茶己有開製</h3>
<p>婺源綠茶、質味優良、爲國内洋莊綠茶中無上高莊貨、花色旣繁、其中最稱珍品者、厥惟珍眉、年來各號爲求在世界博得華茶榮譽、特又發明一種抽芯珍眉其取材其製法　均極盡精審之能事、去年東鄉抽芯、洋商曾提高至三百五十兩、此種市盤、實僞婺邑有茶以來所罕見、而婺茶之名、更因此煌耀於歐美、今歲東路各號、尤精益求精、對本年抽芯、特别重視、在新茶未開園前、即派員紛向產茶名地、搜買青芽嫩尖、每斤出價一元增至一元三四角、合之茶本、須在四百元以上、山價之激昻、尤超於祁貢而上之、婺北金竹吉泰茶號抽芯前日（九日）起己開始揀製、其茶身嫩色香味、四者具備、茶名曰香草、約旬日可以成箱、預料此一批抽貨到申時、定能邀洋商一種美滿深刻之認識也、</p>
<h3>祁門紅茶市價下傾</h3>
<p>祁浮秋屬紅茶、此時本可採摘完竣、因開園以來、幾日不雨、天又常寒、出茶旣難稱旺、號方辦進亦稀、近日二三字茶雖正在出貨、號方目光、咸望此數日天氣放晴、使出茶良好、量身再進、詎兩日來仍不見日光、且大雨傾盆、出貨粗大空鬆、兼之號方接得滬機電告、謂金融仍吃緊、國外茶市未見起色、囑各持愼少做、號方得此電訉、又困於現洋不濟、咸即停秤止辦、山價因之比前數日傾落三十元、市勢頓趨冷淡、反成供過於求、刻各號首字貢茶、均己陸續運行、頭字大帮、日内亦可齊堆啟運、大約旬日後當有大批新貨上市、</p>
<h3>平湖蠶汛悲觀</h3>
<p>近日平湖大易各鄉、以天寒關係、春蠶發育阻滯、其程度各處互殊、早帮己大眠開葉、遲者尙在二眠中天氣不佳、致碍眠汛、今歲遭滬戰打擊、育量己遜往昔、又經濟困難、近日甚致無錢購葉、紛紛將蠶傾棄、桑葉出產過剩、無人問津、故均下鄉兜售、葉價在一元左右、本年蠶業歉收、己證事實、影響商業、實非淺鮮、望當局設法救濟云、</p>
<h3>杭市新繭限價太低</h3>
<p>杭市新繭、業己登塲、大帮繭行、均定今（十八</p>
<p>關係、故事抑制、聞高貨限　　　三十元、故一般售繭鄉民、莫不哀形於色、謂葉本尙屬不榖云</p>
<h3>洋莊絲銷仍無轉機</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無轉機、海外絲電均仍不轉、歡美各莊咸思廉價團積、而華絲商因虧本砇鉅、觀望不售、市氣擯持、廠白黃灰各絲仍因價小而停滯、絲市前途、益無生氣之可言云、</p>
<h3>糧食米市緊而復懈</h3>
<p>滬南昨日各帮來船念三四號、浦存薄弱城鄉店銷因天時轉晴人心看定、常錫北粳及蘇同帮到銷二坪、價無漲跌、早晚稻貨積略有、然走銷竟細、市價定中滯疲、洋蘆尖貨稀市穏、</p>
<p>滬北昨日蘇州河畔各帮來船念五六號、本城本路初活後淡、常錫白粳及崑山江陰米交易清淡、價短一角光景、青角石浦松江等薄稻高貨頗穏、關貨疲落二角、蘆洋尖及糯米無榮辱</p>
<h3>敏黨米獨見俏漲</h3>
<p>洋米新到一船約十萬包</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况初居挺俏本街内地胃口甚香、繼因長江帮辦胃復停、且有新到一船、約計十萬包且洋行究售甚力、安利洋行有七月份過磅一號西貢三千噸、價照昨盤但須先收定洋一成、結果成交一千一百噸、長粒五兩四錢半、圓粒五兩五錢半、回龍小校開二百噸、價四兩九錢七分半、因此現貨市面、略見疲軟、惟敏黨米久無續定、到貨亦乏、存底有限故行情獨見上趨蓋以該米粒子較闊、可以混入杜米中、乃爲本街小米店歡迎、昨開三百包、價至十一元一角半及十元、此前日較漲一角半、他米均居平勢、計開小絞六千包、價十元零六角至十元零五角又陳米三百包價十元零二角八分、又糙米五百包、價九元三角半、西貢一號五百包價十一元六角</p>
<h3>囤戸觀望粉價平落</h3>
<p>昨日麫粉市况、略見平落、因有洋麥到申、而無大帮實消動化、囤戸亦觀望不動、因此人心均不看好、雖洋麥電訉報大、市上價格反見低落昨日略有散戸問津、但五月份之成單己屆打取棧之期、散多勢必回出、後市難見轉機、昨日兵船本月份爲二兩零二分、比前日小五釐、老車牌二兩零三分七厘、亦小二厘半云、</p>
<h3>糖市泰源冰開跌二錢</h3>
<p>漳刁青初到五百包</p>
<p>昨日糖市公會市塲劃盤、交易仍寥、而市象均見黯澹、荷糖二十四號組砂白高貨喊十三兩三錢、普通者十三兩二錢、香港貨十三兩一錢、成交沉寂、進出兩懈、中砂白十三兩、市亦平定、太古糖交易亦靜ＣＷ嘜十五兩九錢半ＨＭ嘜十四兩、趨勢亦平、振記廠本製綿白糖開價十三兩三錢、次十二兩七錢至九錢、共售出二三百袋、漳刁青新到五百包、觀貨尙佳、號喊十一兩、尙少　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　兩六錢、低統手兩　　八兩五錢、比之　　　落二錢、而成交零落、市形平而乏神云、</p>
<h3>南北貨湘蓮回漲甚速</h3>
<p>湘蓮前市普通貨曾降至四十五兩、　查存底終屬不多、而近來銷路復見活動、故市價回漲甚速、漢市辦價最小每砠到過二十五兩許、近己升至二十八九兩、此間行盤頂上潭湘須　五十七八兩、貨尙缺乏、次之五十二三兩至五十兩、常德連四十八兩、趨勢穏定、</p>
<h3>海味螟蜅鮝穏定</h3>
<p>淡菜貨缺居奇</p>

<h3>大來之一生（上）</h3>
<p>— 開煦</p>
<p>一九三二年。誠歷史上最不幸之年歟。何其事變若是之多耶。是年承各國經濟凋敝之餘。全球頓呈杌隍不安之象。無論政治方面。經濟方面。皆發生空前之擾動。而各國名人。亦適於是年相繼凋謝。今大來氏又死矣。距其生時己八十八載。爲人慈藹可親。半生從事於遠東之航業。。吾中華人士。與之相諗者甚衆。今不幸殂謝。特記其生平崖略如下。</p>
<p>大來全名爲羅勃脫大來。CaptainRobert　D.llar於一千八百四十四年生於蘇格蘭之福吉克Falkirk,Scoilando其家世以航海爲生。當其人世之年。伯叔輩曾有三人死於海。蓋彼等所乘之艦。在印度孟買及加爾葛搭之間。遇暴風而沉没。三人殉焉。大來氏十二歲即棄學業。而受傭於一機器廠。其所得之薪資。每星期僅半克朗。大來初得之。曾喜極狂奔數十里。歸獻於其母焉。大來自奉至儉。所得輒貯存之。其母不久下世。其父悲傷之餘。輒沉湎於麵糵。據大來自擬傳略。稱彼等　家即於此時遠徙於加拿大。而彼鑒於其父之沉溺於醇醪。誓終身不近此物焉。大來之誓。彼終身守之不渝。近年每屆其誕生之曰。凡報館記者向丐一言者。輒自稱其畢生成功之要素。實基於不近麵糵云。大來族之遷加拿大時。大來猶是十四齡童子。抵加後。初人一桶廠作工後轉入森林中。爲伐木之役。彼於此時。輒於工作中寓增加學識之心。後遂被升爲一工頭。此時彼己稍有積聚。然命運至不佳。彼舉所貯之五千元。悉爲木行之經營。不幸失敗。盡喪其資。約一千八百八十年。大來舉家遷入美國米西根州之一村。自設一鋸木廠。其地日漸發逹。即今之大來維拉城也。彼以節省之餘。逐漸購置附近公家地產。家基益起。不久復遷至加利福尼亞。以求更大之進展。２初以運輸木材於隣海諸埠爲業。後營業日益擴充。始漸覺海輪之缺少。實爲其營業前途之一大阻碍。惟自其伯叔輩葬身於海後。大來即不願再繼航海之業。至此即若爲世代遺傳冒險性所衝動。决重整舊業焉。實則其始亦不過以航業爲其運輸木材之一副業。初不料今日轉以航業橫行於世界也。</p>
<h3>安息的巨靈</h3>
<p>— 鸚哥</p>
<p>丨故都雜冩之三丨</p>
<p>走進了巨靈的鼻孔一樣的前門城洞，便到了裏城，張開眼來一看，一切都是黑色，祇有疏落的街頭和大厦屋尖上的時鐘發出了一點光亮，我因爲路線的不熟與禦雪品的缺乏，不得不借重了一位中年的洋車夫，講定兩相情願的一個車價，我便坐上了車向我想去的地方去了。</p>
<p>地上的雪己經積得一尺多高，路上的車輛和行人都很稀少，祇有那忠於職守的警察却很像石佛一樣的立在路心，故都，這黑的巨靈，這時是在靜寂中安息着。</p>
<p>車子把我拉過一條長街，長街的兩端都有着鐵門，街上停息着幾輛汽車，安靜和整潔，正和想像中的一樣，我心裏正爲這而懽快，覺得故都，究竟不愧爲過去的京都，過去京都的市政是這樣美麗！我正當爲這而頌歌，却冷不防路旁傳幾曲歌聲，忙看時，祇見一個綠呢制服的軍士，舉着犀利的槍枝在飄揚着米字國旗的建築下度着閒步。我猛然明白這就是東交民巷，於是一般憤恨便把纔剛浮現於心中的愉快趕跑了。是的在這負托着疾病的東亞大國的脈胳上，是没有一處地方不有着殘暴的蛇蝎在活動。</p>
<h3>賣糖毒計</h3>
<p>— 荆夢蝶</p>
<p>暮春天氣。草綠江南。是處錫簫。催人午夢。此鄉邨風味。吾國舊俗也。不意彼慘無人道之倭寇。竟於此寓其陰謀毒計。以殘害我天眞爛漫之小國民焉。當兩星期前。停戰協定未簽字之際。京滬路南一帶鄉問。時有荷擔賣糖者。口吹短笛而來。村童聞聲咸集。其人則釋担而立先取糖分嶒羣兒。人各一塊。及童出錢以買。則所得糖多倍尋常。故到處兒童爭購。生意特盛。一日。宜興金壇間有徐邨者。童子死亡相繼。察知爲食糖故。村人遂糾衆往捕賣糖者。得八人。縳諸樹而拷問之。盡吐其實。蓋亦漢奸之一種也。五人共一船每船每日得餉銀三十元。糖亦日人所發給。無需資本。日人且命若輩擇各村小學校門前爲市。以兒童集中點。一網打盡。事半功倍也。迫於生活。忍作虎倀。復以日人暗中偵察綦嚴。受命後又不得不實行殺人耳。村人復詰以糖中置何種毒。有無方物解救。答以中毒不即死可延旬日後。若取豬肝和野韭菜食之可解云。村人旣解送八漢好入官後。急徧覔野韭。並購豬肝。一時屠市供不應求。豬肝價大漲。至每斤二銀元焉。此事瞬傳各地遐邇聞風。市虎杯蛇。相驚伯有。遂使無毒之糖。亦盡被拒絶。不得入各村喚賣云。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>和平花園美利堅和坎那大之間。最近有一個新的計畫。爲維恃兩國永久的邦交起見。打算建造一座和平花園。以慶賀兩國百餘年來的和平與親善。那花園的面積。約在一千畝左右。地點一半在美國境。一半在坎那大境。大抵是在梅尼土白Manitoba與北逹可太NorthDakcta的地方。兩國的國民。對於這計畫都表示熱烈的同情。决定這園子衷所種的一切花木。完全是兩國的產物。并且要建造一個極大的玻璃花房。全部建築與種植的費用。約需二十萬金鎊。另再募集三十餘萬金鎊。以作永久維持的費用。在鄰國之間。彼此能這樣的表示親善。不相侵略。眞是現世界一個極好的榜樣。尤其是被鄰邦鐵騎無端蹂躪的我國。眞不勝其羨慕啊。</p>
<h3>大减價的上海</h3>
<p>— 孫榖梁</p>
<p>走出大門，就站在南京路上的十字街頭，無論你向那一處望，滿眼都是大減價的旗子！</p>
<p>减價年年有，今年大不同！眞是减了又减，减過了再來一回，繼續不斷，風雨無更，洋洋盈盈，蔚爲大觀。大足表現出大減價的上海來！</p>
<p>這是戰後經濟崩潰的現象嗎？大約凡是商店，莫不感到這苦痛！其實這是一種客觀的「外行批評」！試看戰後銀拆和洋厘的掛牌，都低落到不可再低，能說是戰後經濟崩潰嗎？</p>
<p>我們的所謂調劑社會經濟的金融界的老先生，戴着短視的老光眼鏡，是不管這些的。他們唯一的信條和權威，是今年賺了×萬，捧着「紅帳」，坐了馬車，到老閶面前去獻媚！</p>
<p>有人說，你這話太偏激了，我們唯一的上海，不是也在大减價嗎？停戰協定，不是簽給人家的發票嗎？我勸你掉轉筆頭，把負有調劑土地責任而新近大减價賣出上海的政府先來督責一番吧！</p>
<p>我聽了，却給怔住了，覺這話很不錯，不免暗暗的禱告，大减價的上海完了，希望不要有大减價的中國出現才好</p>

<h3>故都聞見錄銖菴</h3>
<p>— 浴德堂</p>
<p>入西華門觀古物陳列所藏書晝之處。曰武英殿。殿之西北有小殿三權。署曰浴德堂。堂有浴室。室外爲井亭。高與堂齊。亭中一井。以磚石砌成。方形之水管沿堂之後而過。東即浴室。室頂形圓如蓋。井旁之方水管直接於此。其側一小門。鐵檽爲　。一磚臺有階級可登。此臺爲置鐵鑊以煮水者。顯然可見。室之四壁。悉以白色鍊甎甃之。旣非中國之物。亦非近代建築。細推其理。蓋武英殿本爲遠方技術專門人才待詔之所。以聚珍版印書於是。敎習外國語言於是。編修諸專門書籍亦於是此必回回人進土耳其浴法。因令仿其式製之於此。聊以廣異聞而己。而流俗相傳。謂高宗幸回妃某。以體有異香。號曰香妃。因仿其國俗。搆浴殿。殊不思武英殿爲外朝。决非妃嬪能至之地。况於浴乎。俗人不諳國故。懵於史事。動輒附會。而耳食者亦復深信不疑。誠可嗤也。高宗有回妃。其傳說固己甚久。王闓運湘綺樓文集今列女傳一篇即紀其所聞。此原不足異。特不當以浴德堂附會之耳。</p>
<p>就日光曝之。第天時不可測。江南多雨水。若陰晦兼旬。則霉點日益蔓延。坐視其斃。未免可惜。况細種不易得。每尾價逾兼金。吾人旣愛之護之。豈能任其絶滅哉。今歲。董君曾以四金得雙尾龍種。長幾兩寸。肥碩可喜。日者。一尾忽側浮水面。視之己奄奄待斃。董大愕。乞方於余。余細察病在腹霉。鱗次隠約可指。本較爛鰓易治。但連朝細雨。陽光治療。己屬未能。余戲告之曰。人病。可利用人工太陽燈。魚或亦不可。曷不就公司中有聲攝影塲新自美國購來之巨量燈泡燈。一照射之。或可挽回於萬一。董善之。時正連夕攝製啼笑因緣聲片。商之電燈工人。取病魚置小器中。陳以清水。就燈光下照射之。不半時。昔之體側者己漸向平復矣。再以食鹽少許。滲魚患處。更照之。不三時。游泳自如。視其霉處。微現焦黑色。越日。陽光出現。更就日中曝之。三數日來。前恙若失。且追其舊侣。爭逐藻際。覓食紅蟲矣。</p>

<p>— ·憶·秋</p>
<p>我眼光中看出來的人間的一切動作。都是在玩要玩要。</p>
<p>一個人肚裏餓死不要緊。祇怕是心中飢荒。那就非常危險。</p>

<p>法律是富人的走狗。窮人絶對得不到它的保障。</p>
<p>中國的政治舞台。台脚都給蛙蟲蛙空了。站在台上的人。若要動作起來。就要坍台。甚至因之而滾蛋。所以他們台上人唯一的秘訣是「不動」。又因爲「不動」不大好聽。所以又美其名爲「鎭靜」。</p>

<h3>戎馬雙樓記（五六）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第七回干謁到豪門常使將軍顚倒幽覊在情獄卒能夫婿牢籠</p>
<p>梁笑雲謝過了五太太的吹嘘。又稍坐了片刻。也就起身告辭。五太太想留住伊一同出去現要。伊仍是雄說家裏有事。改天再陪。五太太笑道。我知道了。新結婚的人。愛情太濃。片刻兒都離不開。我也就不强留你了。說著。隨又在枕邊檢出個小黑絨盒子來。交與伊道。這東西你還是帶回去罷。你的喜事。我還没送禮怎好先敎你送我這樣最珍貴的物件。梁笑雲卻再三不依道。阿姐。你不能同我這樣客氣。本來這一點點東西絶算不了什麽。又不是我特爲現買了來當禮物送的。阿姐都全知道。怎好不賞個面子呢。况且我和你妹夫將來靠你阿姐照應的日子很長。如阿姐還是見外。我往後還能再來麻煩你央求你嗎。五太太聽伊說得極懇切。便就改了口道。你我姊妹。要好不祇一日。本用不著客套的。旣然妹妹這樣說。我若不接受這東西。反顯得是我不對。那我就謝謝罷。至於妹夫的事情。妹妹你放心。我總緊催著老頭兒辦。你也不妨早一天就領他來。說到這。復表現極關心的樣子。另把德順呌進來吩咐道。你到明天留神看大帥有工夫會客没有。如有機會。你就趕快押了汽車上八小姐宅裏把安先生接來。領去見大帥。頂好妹妹你也再來一趟。德順唯唯稱是。梁笑雲也滿口感謝。隨又掏出二百元鈔票交與德順道。這裏一半是送給你的。你留著零花罷。像你如今這樣。比從前隨著你爸爸跟堂差拉胡琴。你彈月琴凑和著。豈不是有出息得多。你眞應當感激五太太的提拔。往後好好的當差呢。另有一半。請你替我分發給房間裏老媽子們。到明天郤還得多辛苦你。德順笑嘻嘻的不敢就接。五太太便道。妹妹。你這又是做什麽。梁笑雲笑道。小意思。阿姐呌德順收下罷</p>

<h3>循環式的進化</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>入類的進化，哲學家原有幾種說數，一是漸進的，一是螺旋式的，一是循環式的，三說到底何者爲是，尙没有人能肯定，</p>
<p>在原人時代，穴居野處，婚姻制度，未曾產生，男女雜交，禽獸無異，後來文明進步一些，即把婚姻制度嚴格一些，</p>
<p>近據報載維也納有女子八十人，在比沙拉亞之派特倫尼亞附近山中，舉行其秘密禮儀，此種禮儀，係一種新敎派，自稱爲「天眞爛漫者，」好一個「天眞爛漫」的名詞！我國自歐風東漸，文化日進，至於近日，大有一日千里之勢，例如女子，大抵坦胸露臂，緊衣短褲，完全表現其肉感之豐富，曲線之優美，甚至男女同浴，不以爲異，惟尙穿浴衣，未盡赤裸，乃於天眞爛漫之中，尙有一些矯揉造作之意，如使再文明一些，再進步一些，必定與原人時代相同，</p>
<p>故最「天眞爛漫」的，莫過於原人時代，文明進化的歷程，確爲循環式，此事可作一證，</p>

<h3>人造橡皮</h3>
<p>— 緣荷</p>
<p>橡皮乃特種植物之乳液凝固而成，產於南美東印度西印度及阿非利加洲等地，最初僅爲南美土人所採取，鮮有知其功用者，一六一五年歐人TeandeTorquemade氏始有橡皮防水衣之發明，一七七。年英人Priestty氏始發明橡皮有消去鉛筆字迹之功用，其後幾經研究，爲用益著，不但可使之成爲橡皮布，且能令其柔軟，製成種種之模型，</p>
<p>自美人Nelson氏發明硫化法以後，橡皮之功用，發揮無遺，幾爲工業上不可或少之原料，據一九一。年Dr.p.</p>
<p>Schibrowitty之調查，世界橡皮供給之量，己逹八萬一千噸之鉅，可見其在製造上所佔之地位矣，時至近代，天然橡皮之於工業原料，己成求過於供之勢，於是而有人造橡皮之發明，</p>
<p>人造橡皮之製法，種類甚多，其最簡明易行者，以粗麻子油二分，黑他油一分，和煎至能扯成絲時，再加入煎稠之細麻仁油半分而煎之，煎得之物之每百分中，再以十二分之一之鯨頭油，十二分之一之地蠟，用二百五十二度（科倫表）之熱煎之，再加十二分之一之硫磺，俟冷後，即成人造橡皮，</p>
<h3>人造象牙</h3>
<p>人造象牙，色白而質堅，可施以種種雕刻，以之作小工藝品之原料，價廉物美，最爲相宜，茲特錄其輕而易舉者如次，以供有志於此者所採取焉，</p>
<p>（一）以馬鈴薯剝去外皮，浸於淡硫酸液中，經過三十六小時後，即行取出，裏以無膠質之紙，使乾，然後納入模型中，加以重量之外壓力，即成，惟當時須注意者，於硫酸液中，宜逐漸加水，使之沖淡，否則恐遭危險，因硫酸能發大熱也，</p>
<p>（二）用蛋彀粉七兩，石膏粉三兩，調匀，以魚膠化水研練之，盛於塗過猪油之模型中，待七日後，取出使乾，即與魚牙無異，又有以蛋彀細粉與魚膠白蘭地各一兩，調和微温之，攪匀使成泥狀，納入模型中，俟熱度消散，即成固體之象牙，</p>

<h3>解星宿</h3>

<p>李太太因爲家中新近被竊，損失千餘元，並且老爺在上個月，接到了一封恐嚇信，以爲老爺的命運，近來不好，所以接連發生兩椿不遂意事，須得招一位本事高深的算命先生，爲老爺算算命，正在這樣地想，恰好娘姨送進一張傳單來，說是成都路新開一爿課命館，先生很靈，不論命裏那樣歹好，都可算出來，李太太聽了娘姨的話，正中心懷，馬上出去，呌包車夫阿三，快快拉到成都路×先生處，</p>
<p>踏進了課命館，一個五十多歲的老頭兒，上來招呼，說算命的請先掛號，命金號金一起兩角，李太太給了錢，見客堂中間，擺了一隻小方桌，上面陳設的是香爐卦筒字卷等等，正中坐了一位三十多歲的瞎先生，</p>
<p>太太把八字說明了，瞎先生用手一輪，嘴裏鬼觸鬼觸了一陣，說，（這個八字，倘然照寅時正的算，那末人是剛强烈性，若然柔軟的，那是寅時初了，因爲一個時辰，有上中下三刻，太太，這個人究竟怎樣，弄錯了時刻，算起來是不準的）</p>
<p>（性子倒也還好，底下人都說他是和氣的，）李太太回答瞎先生，（那末我照命算，太太聽仔細，這個命寅時頭，人很和平，有飯吃，有點家產，不要尋飯吃的，…）轄先生不曾說完，李太太呷嘴說，（對啊，）</p>
<p>瞎先生先前聽了底下人說他和氣的話，己料定是一位富戸，現在又聽了李太太這樣說，心中早己成竹在胸，富戸有飯吃，來算什麽命，一定發生了什麽大事情，纔會想着來算命，於是往下說，（這命雖然家產不少，但是近來有些不好，看起來破過大財哩，）</p>
<p>（呀！先生眞個像神仙，己經發生過竊案，偷去千外元，不過以後怎麽樣，）</p>
<p>（照八字看起來，恐怕破了千元錢）</p>
<p>，還不彀，命裏實在歹，論不定還要看見看見恐嚇信哩，）</p>
<p>（啊唷唷，一發對了，先生像活看見的，眞的，上個月來了一封恐嚇信，不曉得他命裏，犯了什麽，會弄得這樣，）</p>
<p>（命裏犯有一個玄武盜賊星，這個星宿，非常利害，犯得眞點，連性命也有礙，須得早點想法子，把他解了，方纔可以免去災難，）</p>
<p>（先生，用怎麽法子解呢，）</p>
<p>（容易容易，只要做一天功德，把）</p>
<p>這惡星宿解除，就可消災添福，我們這裏有道士，專門代客包做功德的，）</p>
<p>（介末做一天功德，要多少錢呢，）</p>
<p>（有限，不大的，我們是新開張，媽媽虎虎，不算數，只要四十塊錢彀了，）</p>
<p>（銅鈿儘管憑你四十塊，事體要做）</p>
<p>得道地點，）李太太說畢，在手中帶的小皮夾裏，取出一張十塊頭鈔票，望桌上一擲道，（這是定洋十塊，先生收吧，餘多望事體圓滿後再算罷，）說畢起身往外走，</p>
<p>（不要客氣，太太坐坐好了，恕我們不送了，）瞎先生在桌旁站起來說，（眞眞瞎三話四，就是要你送，也不能啊，）車夫阿三，在門外笑嘻嘻地說，</p>

<p>在表格之中，有這麽一個問題，「你所最崇拜的三個人」在這幾個字的後面，劃了三道橫線，呌我們把三個名字填進去，</p>
<p>於是崇拜政治領袖的填上華盛頓·白里安，汪精衛，喜歡科學的人，冩上愛迪生，牛頓，愛因斯坦，一向在學校裏橫行覇道的人，填上拿破崙蔣介石馮玉祥，</p>

<h3>Opposition to Opium Public Monopoly</h3>
<p>The clamor for an opium public monopoly has been increasing in recent years. Last year, Liu Ruiheng, Wu Liande, and others from the Opium Prohibition Committee, under the pretext of "prohibition through taxation," once encouraged the government to appoint Li Hongji, who had previously managed opium special taxes in Huguang, to establish an Opium Prohibition and Investigation Office and implement it for a time. However, due to opposition from various parties and its eventual cancellation, it has resurfaced recently, taking advantage of the country's urgent need to resist foreign aggression and the people's efforts to save the nation. The opium public monopoly is being secretly implemented without the knowledge of the Chinese people. It has already been implemented in Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and other provinces in North China, and several other provinces are also planning to implement it. Since Hebei implemented the public monopoly, the daily special tax revenue between Tianjin and Beijing has been 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and between Rehe and Pingjin, it has even reached as much as 120,000 yuan. Zhang Xueliang is still trying his best to cover it up, claiming it is a rumor. Supervisory Committee member Gao Youtang impeached Liu Ruiheng, further stating that he "tacitly approves of the planting, transporting, and selling of opium as a personal means of making money, using his authority to openly sell opium, ignoring the ridicule of various countries and disregarding the health of the people. Nothing could be more harmful to the country and the people." From this, it can be seen that the public monopoly has now actually been revived. For the sake of the country's foundation, for the sake of the people's livelihood, and for the sake of the nation's future, what will our thoughts be on this kind of disastrous and crazy measure that fundamentally destroys our nation?</p>
<p>Everyone knows the harm of opium. Even a three-year-old child knows that it is more poisonous than floods and fierce beasts and is a great enemy of mankind. Civilized countries absolutely do not allow its existence. Our country has been sucked and devoured by this evil demon for nearly a century. The Opium War was the beginning of unequal treaties, a great shame and humiliation that any patriotic person should not forget. However, for a century, the poison has spread wider and its roots have become deeper. How many people have been reduced to zombies in hell? Although it was strictly prohibited once in the early years of the Republic of China, the ban was soon relaxed when the warlords were in power. Since then, there has only been the name of opium prohibition without the reality. The more opium is prohibited, the smoother its sales become, the greater the revenue from special taxes, and the greater the opium production. Gradually, some provinces force planting and selling, and monopolize transportation and sales, regarding this as a fixed source of tax revenue. Warlords and bureaucrats especially regard this as a great benefit to fill their private pockets, and even petty officials regard this as a way to intimidate and extort money. Therefore, the so-called opium prohibition is actually a means of promoting it. For twenty years, there has been no second way. As a result, the people are mired in evil ways, and the country suffers from poverty. There are many reasons for the national crisis we face today, but the prevalence of opium, which leads our nation to kill itself without realizing it, causing it to be on its last breath and unable to recover, is also one of the root causes.</p>
<p>Now, those who advocate opium public monopoly say either it is "prohibition through taxation" or it is "opening up financial resources for the country." The so-called "prohibition through taxation" is purely self-deception and is not worth refuting at all. As for the so-called "opening up financial resources for the country," it is even more like drinking poison to quench thirst and cutting flesh to heal wounds, focusing on small immediate gains while giving the nation a fatal blow. It is a fallacious argument that harms the country and the people. If all the land is used to grow opium, agriculture will be abandoned, production will decrease, and toxic substances will increase, with most people becoming useless. This is not only an axe that undermines our national economy but also a poison that destroys our race. In a few decades, there will not only be no land in our country for planting crops but also no people left. If we only seek to extract the people's wealth to fill our private pockets, then we will not care about the country's demise and the race's extinction in a few decades. Have those who hold the reins of power paid attention to this?</p>
<p>We must lodge a stern protest against this conspiracy of opium public monopoly that will destroy the country and the race, and express our firm opposition.</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Parties Yield to the Military</h3>
<p>Suzuki and Araki reach an understanding to form a so-called National Government, changing the face of diplomacy, as expected.</p>
<p>Since the assassination of Japanese Prime Minister Inukai, world opinion has feared the rise of the Japanese military faction and the changing international situation. British newspapers said the Manchurian issue would become more urgent, while Russian newspapers said it would greatly increase the crisis of war in the Far East. Others said the opportunity for a Japanese-American war was becoming increasingly imminent. Although the reorganization of the current cabinet is not yet finalized, the Seiyukai has accepted the opinions of the military faction. Even if the future Japanese cabinet is headed by Suzuki, it will only be a nominal head, and real power will inevitably be in the hands of the military. This is clearly visible. The relationship between this matter and the fate of the world is not superficial. The following is a compilation of various telegrams:</p>
<h3>Calls for Suzuki to Form a Cabinet</h3>
<p>After lobbying and reaching an understanding with the military, a cabinet united across the country will be formed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Dentsu) - Regarding the next cabinet, Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai, and Araki, the Minister of the Army, reached an understanding today to form a cabinet united across the country. With Suzuki as the prime minister, they will recruit talent from the Minseito and various other sectors. It is expected that the imperial order to form a cabinet will be issued to Suzuki around the 20th. The most likely candidate for the new foreign minister of the new cabinet is Uchida Kosai, the current president of the South Manchuria Railway. However, Minister of the Army Araki formally stated at a meeting of the top military leaders at the Ministry of the Army today that even if a cabinet united across the country is formed, he will not remain in office and recommends Vice Chief of Staff Masaki as the next Minister of the Army.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Dentsu) - Minister of the Army Araki formally met with President Suzuki and Secretary-General Mori at the Prime Minister's official residence at 4:00 p.m. today to discuss forming a cooperative cabinet. After exchanging opinions, Minister of the Army Aramoto seemed to have reached an understanding. The meeting ended at 5:05 p.m. The main points of the meeting are as follows: Minister of the Army Araki said that he personally does not consider political party politics to be bad. However, from the perspective of young people, the politics of today's political parties do not seem to be endorsed by the general public. Since this is a cabinet in an extraordinary time, why not form a cabinet united across the country? President Suzuki said that it seems impossible to unite the already divided political parties. Therefore, he is not considering a cooperative cabinet or a coalition cabinet at this time but will not hesitate to recruit suitable talent. After the meeting, President Suzuki said that he believes that the first priority is to relieve the rural villages, the second is to strengthen national defense, the third is to guide thought, and the fourth is to conduct righteous diplomacy. If a coalition cabinet can be formed, it will inevitably lead to division. Therefore, it is welcome for the Seiyukai to join the cabinet. He plans to form a cooperative cabinet, and he thinks the military can accommodate it.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Dentsu) - Suzuki is strongly opposed to the single-party cabinet of the Seiyukai. The military, which advocates forming a cabinet united across the country, is working hard to seek understanding and has sent people to lobby the Minister of the Army. The Minister of the Army replied that he hopes to realize a powerful cabinet that can fundamentally reform the current political and economic institutions. This is the intention of the military and cannot be shaken. If this is ignored, it is difficult to guarantee that no major unfortunate events will occur again. His own advance and retreat will also be determined by this general trend. He deeply hopes that the Minister of the Interior will give this deep consideration. Therefore, it is difficult for Suzuki's formation of a cabinet to disregard the intentions of the military. How the political situation will change after Saionji's arrival in Kyoto tomorrow night is unpredictable.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Dentsu) - Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai, is considering the intentions of the military. Yesterday afternoon, he sent Secretary-General Mori to visit Minister of the Army Araki to discuss their opinions. Minister of the Army Araki replied with a strong attitude through a certain person, saying that there are many in the military, especially among young officers, who are dissatisfied with the current political parties and hope to fundamentally reform the political institutions. Please, President Suzuki, give it full consideration. Regarding this matter, Suzuki told others that since the intentions of the military are quite strong, if he makes a mistake at this time, it will inevitably affect the overall situation. Therefore, he is giving this deep consideration. However, he still believes that a single-party cabinet based on political parties is ideal. Now that he has taken office as president, he will definitely purify the political party and let everyone see it.</p>
<h3>Conditions for the Military to Join the Cabinet</h3>
<p>Recruit talented people from outside the parties to sweep away the long-standing abuses of party politics.</p>
<p>Take the welfare of farmers as the banner.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Hua Lian) - The Japanese Army held a meeting of the three chiefs at the Ministry of the Army today. The attendees were Vice Chief of Staff Masaki, Inspector General of Education Muto, and Minister of the Army Araki. They discussed the attitude the army should take towards Suzuki's organization of a cabinet united across the country. It is reported that the following conditions will be used to support Suzuki in organizing a cabinet united across the country: (1) Gather talented people from outside the parties to form a cabinet united across the country; (2) Suzuki's private agreement with the military must be made public to ensure its implementation; (3) Propose new policies and demand that the government implement its new policies: (1) Revise the various inappropriate systems of the current capitalism; (2) Abolish the malpractices of political party politics; (3) Reconstruct the rural areas and guarantee the livelihood of farmers; (4) Implement various social policies and adopt the military's strong diplomatic policies.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Reuters) - The Japanese military's expression of sympathy for farmers and small-capital merchants, and the reduction of the economic difficulties in the rural areas that undermine public prestige, are matters of utmost urgency. These two points seem to occupy an important part in deciding the new cabinet. A Reuters reporter visited a well-informed person, who claimed that the military has not firmly refused to join the new cabinet, but strongly advocates the organization of a national government. From this aspect, it has been learned that the military has agreed to recommend the Minister of the Army to join the Seiyukai cabinet to be organized by Suzuki, but the government must be responsible for sponsoring the military's platform, which includes changing the tax system to seek relief for farmers, and allowing farmers and small-capital merchants to extend the repayment of their debts. The Japanese military is calling for sympathy for farmers and small businessmen and believes that relieving the economic difficulties in rural areas is the most important thing. Suzuki, who is calling for the formation of a cabinet, is a powerful figure in the Japanese political world and has a close relationship with Hiranuma, Araki, and others, the leaders of the nationalist Kokuhonsha.</p>
<p>Tokyo Political Change</p>
<h3>Further Increase the Chances of War in the Far East</h3>
<p>Speech by the Chief of Staff of the Russian Red Army</p>
<p>Moscow, 18th (Kokumin) - General Avallov, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Russian Red Army, gave a radio speech, broadcasting to the whole country, saying that the Tokyo Incident may greatly increase the crisis of war in the Far East. Avallov also traced the assassinations of Japanese Prime Minister Inukai and French President Doumer, saying that they came from the same source and were motivated by hatred of Soviet Russia. Inukai did not advocate implementing an anti-Russian policy in Manchuria, so those people decided to remove him in order to implement their anti-Russian policy. The inside story of this case was arranged by people with great power, so it is very worrying. In the past, Inukai's strong and powerful hand prevented Japanese military officers from recklessly advancing towards the Soviet Russian border. Now, this strong and powerful hand has disappeared with Inukai's tragic death. We can only defend ourselves. He also said that the Red Army commanders should closely observe all developments, and the Red diplomats should do their best to seek understanding with the new Japanese government. Finally, he said that although it seems impossible to reach an understanding with the Japanese militarists, it will be seen in the next few weeks whether the military or the diplomats will ultimately control Manchuria.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Military Clique in Power</h3>
<p>Is Enough to Endanger World Peace</p>
<p>Londoners Express Fear</p>
<p>London, 18th (Reuters) - The result of the Japanese political change and its repercussions on the Far Eastern situation have aroused great fear among Londoners. All political parties are now discussing this matter. The Conservative Party expects that after the military controls the Japanese cabinet, its policy towards Manchuria will go a step further, and it is only a hair's breadth away from formal annexation. The Labor Party speculates on the danger of a "national government" and firmly believes that this may be a disguised military dictatorship, which is enough to endanger world peace. The general public agrees that the Japanese army and navy are still filled with resentment over the withdrawal of troops from Shanghai. Therefore, they may take a tough attitude in Manchuria, regardless of possible opposition from Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Kokumin) - The Far East Incident has had a negative impact on the Berlin Stock Exchange. The market opened strong in the morning, but as rumors of possible war in the Far East became more and more credible, various market prices quickly fell, resulting in a volatile pattern. At the close, there was still a downward trend.</p>
<h3>The Old Duke Enters Beijing Today</h3>
<p>To Listen to the Opinions of Important Ministers</p>
<p>To Determine the Next Cabinet</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Nichiren) - Saionji's secretary, Harada, came to Beijing a few days ago to listen to opinions from all sides. This morning at 8:00 a.m., he left Beijing and returned to Okitsu to report everything to the Old Duke. Saionji is preparing to go to Beijing tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Dentsu) - Saionji has decided to depart from Shizuoka Station at 1:00 p.m. on the 19th and arrive at Tokyo Station at 4:55 p.m. Given the importance of the situation, Saionji will first hold important talks with Suzuki's attendant, Makino Naifu, President of the Privy Council Kuratomi, Kiyoura Keigo, and other important ministers after entering Beijing, and will also find out the intentions of the military. Once he is confident that a cooperative cabinet can properly handle the situation, he will immediately request that President Suzuki organize the next cabinet. President Suzuki will immediately start forming the cabinet.</p>
<h3>Softening of the Minseito</h3>
<p>Actually Supporting a National Cabinet</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Dentsu) - Regarding the issue of the next cabinet, the Minseito is following the precedent of when Prime Minister Hamaguchi was assassinated, hoping to form a Seiyukai cabinet of the majority party. As of yesterday, they have changed their attitude and are leaning towards a cabinet united across the country, saying that at this time of national crisis, it is difficult for the Seiyukai's single-party cabinet to cope with the situation. A cabinet united across the country based on the two factions of the Seiyukai and Minseito must be formed. Last night, Chief Secretary Yasumoto, Kawanaki Takukichi, Secretary-General Nagai, and others gathered at the Japan Club to discuss this matter. Today, they will further seek the opinion of President Wakatsuki and then proceed with preparations. The Minseito's tendency towards a cabinet united across the country is an important indication of the future of the situation, and its progress is worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Navy Prepares for the Aftermath</h3>
<p>Determined to Punish the Culprits and Maintain Military Discipline</p>
<p>Striving to Eliminate the Evil Habit of Military Interference in Politics</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Dentsu) - The naval authorities are currently discussing measures to deal with the aftermath of the unfortunate incident that occurred on the 15th. The highest opinion was only determined this morning. Minister of the Navy Osumi visited Marshal Togo at 9:30 a.m. to explain the following countermeasures and seek his understanding: (1) Throughout this incident, maintain a cautious attitude and investigate the criminals and their origins in order to revitalize military discipline; (1) Uphold the Emperor's edict to the military, and especially for military personnel, especially young officers with insufficient thinking, absolutely eliminate their interference in politics.</p>
<h3>Today, Jiangwan and Pengpu are Taken Over</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army in Zhenru, Yangxing, and Baoshan will Continue to Withdraw on Schedule</p>
<p>The Two Sides Exchanged Prisoners of War at the North Station This Morning</p>
<p>Our Side Has Lodged Representations Regarding the Moving of Railway Property by the Japanese Side</p>
<p>The area scheduled to be taken over today is the four districts and three sub-districts, namely Zhenru. Due to a temporary notice from the Japanese side, the Jiangwan troops will be withdrawn first. Therefore, our side sent Dai Hongen, the head of the fifth sub-district of the fifth district, as the takeover officer yesterday, with Liang Fuchu and Li Shengzong as assistants. They went to Daba yesterday to prepare. The police force was transferred from the Luodian Security Team to maintain order. In addition, prisoners of war were exchanged at the North Station at 10:00 a.m. today. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Takeover Meeting Yesterday Morning at Ten</h3>
<p>At one o'clock, the takeover meeting was held at the Joint Society to discuss the handover of Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Pengpu districts. Those present were Chairman Yin Ruheng, Committee Members Ruzheng, Liang Fuchu, Tao Xiaojie, Zha Nanqiang, various special commissioners (above committee), Huang Ming, Yin Tixin, Shi Jinzhang, Dai Hongen, Liu Zhenjun, Wu Qing (above Public Security Bureau), Ma Chonggan (Education Bureau), Yang Yufen (Jinan University), Wang Er (Labor University), Wu Liangqing, Zhang Xiangshi (above Cultural Academy), Zhu Shaocheng (Judicial Administration Department Legal District Research Institute), Wu Xuen (Jiangwan District Municipal Committee), Wu Chuiquan (Jiangwan Security Regiment), Zhou Nianzu, Ling Zhibin (above Pengpu District Municipal Committee), Wang Shouyu (Zhenru District Municipal Committee), Wang Zhiyuan (Nineteenth Route Army Office), Jin Zhu, Yu Ruilin (above Jinghu Railway), Lu Hongxun (International Telegraph Bureau), Zhu Fuyi (Shanghai Telephone Bureau), Tao Fengshan (Shanghai-Hankou Telegraph Engineering Office), Cai Xiangsun, Gu Shanzhang (above Jiangwan Fire Brigade). Chairman Yin Ruheng announced the opening of the meeting and immediately discussed the takeover method. The resolutions are listed as follows: (A) Regarding the Jiangwan takeover area case: (1) The area to be taken over this time is Jiangwan Town and the area west of Songhu Road; (2) The relevant personnel receiving Jiangwan tomorrow will assemble at this meeting at 9:00 a.m. and depart for Jiangwan at 9:00 a.m.; (3) The Jiangwan Station and Gaojing Temple Station will be temporarily suspended for takeover; (B) Each agency in the Jiangwan takeover area should send personnel to take over: Resolved, each agency should send a list of takeover personnel for the meeting to handle; (C) How should this meeting take over Pengpu: Resolved, (1) This meeting will notify the Japanese side that because the Japanese army has left Pengpu and has not notified our side, this meeting is scheduled to send police tomorrow to deploy defenses. Please pay attention not to enter our defense line; (2) The aforementioned police force will be transferred from Daba to maintain public order; (3) Pengpu Municipal Committee Member Ling Zhibin will be sent to assist in handling; (4) After taking over the district, the security regiment will be quickly restored; (5) The Public Security Bureau will send the original police officers to quickly investigate the household registration and handle the aftermath. Regarding the Zhenru takeover matters, a meeting will be convened another day to discuss.</p>
<h3>Statement by Our Committee Member</h3>
<p>Today's takeover area, according to the original notice from the Japanese side, was designated as the Zhenru area. However, the Japanese side suddenly changed it temporarily the day before yesterday, saying that the Jiangwan troops would be withdrawn first today. Therefore, our side also took over Jiangwan first today. However, when our side takes over, it must cross the Japanese defense line, which inevitably takes some effort. Therefore, our joint committee member Yu Hongjun, in order to be prudent, verbally explained to the chairman of the joint committee, Kebinman, at noon yesterday that the change from Zhenru to Jiangwan for today's takeover area was a temporary change by the Japanese side.</p>

<h3>Taking Over Jiangwan Today, the Japanese Army in Jiangwan Town</h3>
<p>is scheduled to withdraw at 10:00 a.m. this morning and will be completed by 11:00 a.m. The police officers sent by our side are scheduled to arrive in Jiangwan at 9:00 a.m. As soon as the Japanese army withdraws, they will take over. Dai Hongen, the chief of the fifth sub-district of the fifth district of the Public Security Bureau, has been assigned by the takeover committee to be responsible for taking over Jiangwan Town, and Liang Fuchu and Li Shengjun, three special commissioners of the takeover committee, will assist in everything. As for the police officers of our side, the takeover committee has ordered Captain Bian of the Capital Security Team to dispatch a company from Luodian to Jiangwan at 9:00 a.m. today to handle the takeover matters with Chief Dai Hongen.</p>
<h3>Transferring Police to Defend, the Takeover Committee Orders Beiping</h3>

<p>Captain Lu of the Security Team transferred a company from Zhabei, and Captain Bian of the Capital Security Team transferred a company from Luodian. Both arrived outside Jiangwan Town before 10:00 a.m. on the 19th and handled the takeover of Jiangwan with Chief Dai Hongen.</p>
<h3>Taking Over Pengpu Today, the Japanese Army in Pengpu Town</h3>
<p>According to our report, they had already withdrawn. However, there was no official notification from the Japanese side, so it was not taken over. There have been many robberies in the town recently. The takeover committee should send a letter to the Japanese side requesting a confirmed takeover date. Yesterday, a reply was received stating that our side would take over Pengpu Town at 2:00 p.m. today. The takeover committee has already prepared everything yesterday.</p>
<h3>Negotiating the Transfer of Railway Property Before the withdrawal of</h3>
<p>part of the Japanese army in Zhabei, the Japanese army moved a lot of items from the North Station on the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th of this month. All the machines, electrical equipment, and other materials in the station were moved away. Even the chairs, tables, and daily necessities in the station's various rooms were moved away, leaving nothing behind. At the same time, several of our armored vehicles at the North Station were burned down because the Japanese army could not move them away, resulting in a total loss of tens of thousands of gold. Personnel from the Railway Bureau saw the Japanese army moving items and immediately reported it to the takeover committee. The committee notified our committee members Yu Hongjun and Wen Yinxing of the joint committee yesterday and requested that they negotiate with the Japanese side to strictly investigate the items moved away by the Japanese army and guarantee that the Japanese side would not repeat such incidents in the future. The Japanese side has repeatedly stated that it will return the Yunzaobang train material factory, but it has delayed the handover. It will probably only be handed over when the Japanese troops finally withdraw.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Administration Committee Communiqué Yesterday at Seven</h3>
<p>At 30 minutes, the Takeover Committee issued a communiqué saying: (1) A letter was sent to Chairman Ke and our committee members Yu and Wen of the Joint Committee, requesting that they negotiate with the Japanese side to strictly investigate the motors, machines, and other items moved away from the North Station of the Jinghu Railway by the Japanese army; (2) This committee appointed Dai Hongen, the chief of the fifth sub-district of the fifth district of the Public Security Bureau, to be responsible for taking over Jiangwan Town, and appointed Liang Fuchu and Li Shengjun, special commissioners of this committee, to assist in everything; (3) This committee ordered the Capital Security Team to arrive outside Jiangwan Town before 9:00 a.m. on the 19th and handle the takeover of Jiangwan with Chief Dai Hongen.</p>
<h3>Exchanging Prisoners of War This Afternoon During the Sino-Japanese War,</h3>
<p>all prisoners of war on both sides were agreed by both sides to be exchanged at the North Station at 10:00 a.m. today. There were 38 of our soldiers captured by the Japanese army. Our Nineteenth Route Army released all prisoners of war after an interrogation, so there were no detentions. Only two Japanese soldiers killed in contact with Xinmuqiao, Taicang, on April 21 were placed in thick coffins and stored in Taicang. Due to the exchange, the magistrate of Taicang County was specially telegraphed to transport them to Shanghai the night before last and hand them over to the Japanese side for collection.</p>
<h3>Talk by Mr. Yu Hongjun</h3>
<p>According to Joint Committee Member Yu Hongjun, the Japanese side has given verbal notification of its schedule, including (1) Zhenru and the area north of the Jinghu Railway in Zhabei (territory under the jurisdiction of four districts and three sub-districts), the Japanese army is scheduled to withdraw completely on the 23rd; (2) The Japanese army in Yangxing Town is scheduled to withdraw completely on the 24th; (3) The Japanese army in Baoshan County is scheduled to withdraw completely on the 25th. If the official written notice from the Japanese side does not change temporarily, our side will send personnel to take over accordingly. The Taicang County side found two Japanese corpses a few days ago and brought them to Shanghai a few days ago. After notifying the Japanese side that day, the two corpses were transported to Wusong yesterday morning and collected by personnel sent by the Japanese military. As for the 38 soldiers of our side who were captured, the Japanese side notified us yesterday that they would be handed over to our side at the North Station at 10:00 a.m. today. The municipal government, in order to revive the disaster areas in Shanghai and Songhu, had an organization of the Reconstruction Committee. Now that the National Government has also established a Reconstruction Committee for this matter and the list of personnel has also been announced, the municipal government's proposed establishment of a Reconstruction Committee is still under consideration. In the future, the name may be changed to specialize in the reconstruction of the disaster areas in the city, so as not to have a conflict in name. Yu also said that after the Japanese army invaded, Mayor Wu of the municipal government ordered him and the Shanghai Gazetteer to compile a true record of the Japanese army's invasion. The English version has already been drafted and sent to the League of Nations Investigation Team and related countries, while the Chinese version is still being compiled.</p>
<h3>Appropriation for the Reorganization of the Zhabei Public Works Bureau</h3>
<p>Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Yinxiang, and the city center districts are about to be successively recovered. Matters concerning the aftermath of these districts urgently need to be addressed. The first step should be the restoration of transportation. A plan has been drafted and submitted to the municipal government, requesting an appropriation of funds for its implementation. Yesterday, the municipal government approved an initial allocation of 20,000 yuan. The order stated, "The submitted documents are noted. An initial allocation of 20,000 yuan is approved for the bureau to commence work promptly. Further assessments and cost estimates should be submitted after taking over the areas for further review and action. This order is issued to the Finance Bureau for compliance." It is reported that the Municipal Public Works Bureau's plan to restore transportation in the war zone includes: (1) Removing defensive works obstructing traffic on various routes; (2) Filling in trenches; (3) Clearing debris and wooden materials from the roads, temporarily piling them to the sides for passage; (4) Repairing ditches and bridges; (5) Demolishing dangerous buildings. The estimated cost is over 65,000 yuan, and it will take at least two months to complete all the work.</p>
<h3>Report on Population Changes</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau issued Public Notice No. 10 of the Zheng Zi Department yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of the public notice, since the January 28th Incident, people have been relocating and evacuating, causing business to stagnate, and population changes have largely gone unreported and unregistered. Now that social order is gradually returning to normal, it is imperative to conduct a thorough census and registration in accordance with regulations to emphasize the importance of household registration. All citizens, if there are discrepancies in population figures compared to previous records, or if there have been relocations, births, deaths, inheritances, or disappearances that have not been reported, must report and register at their respective police districts before the 31st of this month. Those who fail to report within the deadline will be punished according to law upon discovery, without leniency. In addition to instructing all district offices to comply, this notice is hereby issued for public awareness. All citizens are urged to comply and not delay, lest they face penalties. This notice."</p>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters Resumes Normal Operations Yesterday</p>
<h3>Responsible Personnel Deny Non-Stationing of Troops Within Twenty Kilometers</h3>
<p>Following the January 28th Incident, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, located in the garrison area, retreated with the 19th Route Army to avoid becoming a target for the Japanese military. With the successive withdrawal of troops, the headquarters, as the city's garrison authority, resumed normal operations yesterday at its original location in Longhua. Key news regarding the headquarters is summarized below.</p>
<h3>Discussion of the Course of the War with Newspaper Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reporters from various newspapers visited the headquarters and sought an audience with the adjutant general. As the adjutant general was absent, Deputy Adjutant Chen Letian received them and reported on the course of the war. According to him, the headquarters frequently received phone calls from various locations outside the area on the afternoon of January 28th, inquiring about our withdrawal beyond twenty kilometers. The headquarters, having no prior knowledge of this, replied that they were unaware. As the evening progressed, the rumors intensified, and intelligence reports indicated that the Japanese army would attack Zhabei that evening. However, all the conditions proposed by the Japanese side had been painfully accepted by our side, and the Japanese Consul-General also considered them satisfactory, generally believing that an unfortunate incident would not occur. Unexpectedly, at 11:15 PM, the Japanese army led plainclothes troops to attack Zhabei from multiple directions. At that time, our army's duty was to resist the Japanese army. In addition to assisting the 19th Route Army in combat, the headquarters also managed rear area support. All, including the commander, were seriously committed to resisting Japan. After our army retreated to the second defense line, and the ceasefire conference was convened and the agreement signed, the headquarters returned from the front line to its original location today to resume normal operations.</p>
<h3>Denial of Non-Stationing of Troops Within Twenty Li</h3>
<p>The reporters also asked Deputy Adjutant Chen about the widely publicized issue of the Japanese side's claim of a twenty-kilometer zone where Chinese troops could not be stationed. Deputy Adjutant Chen replied that Commander Dai had repeatedly stated that this was entirely Japanese propaganda. The general idea can be seen in the correspondence between Commander Dai and Mr. Wang Xiaolai. Commander Dai had firmly stated to others that the Japanese side had never mentioned the non-stationing of Chinese troops within twenty kilometers during the ceasefire conference. They are now making unfounded claims. We, based on the agreement, will not pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>No Orders Received from Higher Command Regarding the Return of Our Troops</h3>
<p>The reporters also inquired about when our troops would return to their defensive positions. Deputy Adjutant Chen replied that the Japanese army is currently withdrawing. To avoid misunderstandings, it was stated in the agreement that our troops would not advance until the Japanese army had completely withdrawn. Judging from the current situation, the return of our troops should not be far off. However, the military must obey the orders of superiors. Without an explicit order from the military headquarters to return to their positions, they cannot lightly advance or retreat.</p>
<h3>Prisoners Will Be Moved Back from Hangzhou</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of war, various prisoners held by the garrison headquarters were initially moved to Caohejing. When our army retreated to the second defense line, they were further transported to Hangzhou. It is now learned that these prisoners, mostly political prisoners, have been interrogated and will soon be released or imprisoned separately. They will be returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Consideration by the Consular Body</p>
<h3>The Wuzhen Road Incident</h3>
<p>The Japanese Newspaper Claims the Japanese Army is Slandered</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that the Shanghai Consular Body held a meeting at the US Consulate General yesterday (the 17th) afternoon to consider a report from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department to Senior Consul Cunningham regarding the incident on May 3rd when Japanese sailors crossed the Wuzhen Road Bridge and stabbed several Chinese civilians. The report was accompanied by a formal protest from the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, and a letter requesting the Senior Consul to note that this case could implicate the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities, especially at a time when efforts are being made to restore normalcy. The letter also requested the Senior Consul to inform the Japanese authorities of the case to prevent such incidents from recurring. During yesterday's meeting of the Consular Body, the Japanese Consul-General, Mr. Murai, was still recovering from his injuries and was represented by Mr. Iguchi. This morning, the Japanese newspaper "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" commented on the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department's report and the Shanghai Municipal Council's letter, stating that the Consular Body had no right to restrict the actions of the Japanese military and that the Japanese military felt slandered by the actions of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Continues to Withdraw</h3>
<p>Regular Sailings of Japanese Ships Resume</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Continues Withdrawal</h3>
<p>The 36th Regiment of the Japanese 9th Division, led by Commander Oga, returned to Japan on the Asama Maru. At 11:30 AM yesterday, one regiment of infantry belonging to the Ono Brigade arrived at Yangshupu and embarked on the Maya Maru at the Huishan Wharf, departing Wusong at 12:00 PM. Additional army withdrawals will continue on the 20th and 21st. Four hundred soldiers of the special naval landing force from the Wusong Naval Port also returned to Japan on the special service ships Hirato and Hodoto yesterday afternoon. Rear Admiral Uematsu, commander of the Shanghai Naval Landing Force, and others went to the wharf to deliver speeches and bid them farewell.</p>
<h3>Flagship's Departure Date</h3>
<p>The flagship Izumo, on which Admiral Nomura, commander of the Third Fleet, is aboard, remains stationed in front of the Japanese Consulate. The surrounding balloon and electric wire network has not been removed. According to information from the Japanese Navy, the ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai at the end of this month, after the complete withdrawal of the 9th Division, carrying Shirakawa, Ueda, and Nomura. At that time, the Shanghai Navy will continue to be stationed by the Yangtze River First Overseas Dispatch Unit, with approximately twenty Japanese warships remaining from Shanghai to Hankou and Chongqing.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Dream of a Free City in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Matsuoka Leaves, Arima Arrives</p>
<p>The Pacific News Agency reported that the concept of establishing Shanghai as a free city is a Japanese dream. Yosuke Matsuoka, who spearheaded this initiative, was ordered to come to Shanghai and engage with various foreign merchants. However, following the assassination of Tsuyoshi Inukai in Tokyo, Matsuoka rushed back to Japan overnight upon hearing the news. Now, the Japanese government has dispatched Arima, the ambassador to Brazil, to China to continue the effort. Arima recently visited various important figures in our country in Beijing. Apart from President Wang, who advised against his actions, others, such as Foreign Minister Luo, refused to meet him. As Arima found the attitude of the Beijing government firm, he took the Poyang steamer to Shanghai yesterday to continue Matsuoka's efforts. This matter has attracted considerable attention from various sectors in the city. It is hoped that foreign merchants will not be swayed by him.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents' Meeting Today</h3>
<p>To Seek Cancellation of Our Boycott Movement</p>
<p>Yasui, the acting chairman of the Japanese Residents' Corporation Committee, believing that the invading Japanese troops in Shanghai have been withdrawing in batches and returning home, and that Japanese merchants in Shanghai urgently need to resume business, convened an emergency committee meeting on the 16th. After the meeting, he telegraphed the government that evening, requesting loans of capital and thorough negotiations with China to cancel all boycott movements as a fundamental remedy. It is learned that the committee received a reply from the government yesterday, which considered the request for loans of capital feasible in practice but stated that the request for thorough negotiations to cancel all boycott movements required a concrete plan from Japanese residents in Shanghai for reference. Therefore, Yasui, the chairman of the Japanese Residents' Corporation Committee, has distributed an urgent notice convening an emergency committee meeting at 7:00 PM today at the Japanese Club, 69 Wenchanshi Road. After discussing and formulating a plan, the results of the meeting will be telegraphed to the government for reference.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bar Association Declaration</h3>
<p>Extradition of Political Prisoners Violates the General Principles of International Law</p>
<p>Careful Attention Should Be Paid to Laws and Agreements</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association issued a declaration yesterday stating that on April 30th of this year, detectives from the French Concession police, along with Japanese military police, went to 27 Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre, to arrest Korean Li Chunshan. At that time, Li was out, and Ahn Chang-ho, who became a Chinese citizen in 1922, happened to be there and was detained. He was taken to the Louza Police Station along with 25 other Koreans who were arrested at the same time and sent to the Japanese military camp. Since this incident, due to criticisms from Chinese and foreign newspapers, the French Concession authorities issued a statement in Chinese and Western languages on the 13th of this month, defending their actions as legal. However, based on the facts recorded by various parties, the following four points were not clarified in the statement: (1) Ahn Chang-ho's arrest was without a warrant and was the result of being accidentally found at Li Chunshan's residence; (2) Ahn Chang-ho's Chinese nationality; (3) The location to which the arrested persons were taken was either the Japanese consular court or the Japanese military camp; (4) The similar provisions in Chinese and foreign laws regarding political prisoners, which have been the custom of the Concession for decades. That is, unless a crime is in progress, the police must obtain a warrant from the judicial authorities before making an arrest. If Ahn Chang-ho was arrested on that day because he happened to visit Li Chunshan's house and was encountered by the Japanese military police, and the arrest was made without a prior warrant, then it is a well-known fact that the actions of the French Concession police violated the legal provisions protecting the freedom of the people and the customs of the Concession. The impact on the future of the people of the French Concession is self-evident. Secondly, regarding the issue of Ahn Chang-ho's nationality, it is an undeniable fact that Ahn Chang-ho has Chinese nationality. The French Concession authorities' statement that the arrested persons claimed to be Korean nationals refers to their failure to renounce their original Japanese nationality. In the event of dual nationality, the principles of international law should be applied, and the law of the country where the person is located should be followed. Chinese law stipulates that anyone naturalized as a Chinese citizen with the permission of the government is a Chinese citizen and does not require formal renunciation of their original nationality. Therefore, Koreans who have obtained Chinese nationality, even if they have not renounced Japanese nationality, should be regarded as Chinese citizens within Chinese territory. The French Concession police, without obtaining a warrant from the court, arrested him and did not send him to court within 24 hours, but sent this Chinese citizen to the Japanese military camp, which was in conflict with China. What is the impact of this action on Chinese sovereignty and the stimulation of the Chinese people? The statement also stated that, according to current treaties, countries that have jurisdiction over their nationals in China can execute warrants issued by their judicial authorities within the Concessions. We have not heard of whether this treaty has been agreed to by the Chinese government, and it is even more unknown. Even if this treaty is considered valid, its scope is limited to purely judicial matters, and the Concession police are only obligated to execute it. Whether the current arrest of Koreans was ordered by a Japanese judicial officer or requested by the Japanese military police is unknown. However, after being taken to the Japanese side, according to newspaper reports, the arrested persons were imprisoned in a Japanese military camp, which clearly shows that the arrest was not initiated by the judiciary but by the military. The Concession police may have the responsibility to execute the orders of the judicial authorities of various countries with extraterritorial rights, but they cannot be said to have the responsibility to execute the orders of the military of various countries. This is what the statement failed to explain to us. Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that the Koreans whom the Japanese authorities requested the French Concession to arrest this time were all political prisoners. According to the general principles of international law, political prisoners residing in other countries should be protected by the host country and should not be extradited. France, in particular, is a country that is happy to protect political prisoners. The recent case of Koutiepov, in which the Paris police spared no effort in investigating it, is a clear example. The Korean people fled to the French Concession in Shanghai seeking independence for their country. They have a special responsibility to protect these political prisoners. Now, at the request of the Japanese authorities, they were all arrested and sent to the Japanese military camp. This is a move that greatly violates international law, and no one can defend it. In a French Concession with such a dense population, the maintenance of order and the prosperity of the market depend on the strict adherence to the law by the judicial and police organs. If residents can be arbitrarily arrested and punished, and the Sino-French agreement can be disregarded at will, then the people's property, security, and freedom will be lost. Such a large Chinese and foreign commercial center will fall into a dangerous state without laws, and its future will inevitably lead to unimaginable circumstances. Moreover, it will make the Chinese people doubt France's diplomatic policy towards China, believing that it may be biased and lead to such actions. In order to strive for the security of the residents of the French Concession, and to prevent misunderstandings between the Chinese and French people, which may affect the close relations between the two countries for decades, we hope that the French Concession authorities will pay careful attention to the law and agreements in handling any event, so as not to repeat the mistakes of this time. It must be understood that the law is the only guarantee of the people. If the law is disregarded, then society will not be able to continue to exist, and those who bear this responsibility are especially the local administrative organs. The Concession authorities should not ignore this important responsibility. Shanghai Bar Association, May 17, 1932.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request for Protest Against the Arrest of Ahn Chang-ho</h3>
<p>Should be Handed Back and Tried by Our Courts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday regarding the French Concession's handing over of Ahn Chang-ho to the Japanese, requesting that they protest and insist that our country conduct the trial itself. The telegram reads: "To the Executive Yuan in Luoyang, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: Ahn Chang-ho, a Korean arrested by the Japanese in the French Concession in connection with the Hongkou bomb incident, has been found to have been naturalized as a Chinese citizen. The archives of the former Ministry of Interior and the government gazettes can be consulted. The Shanghai Bar Association is also reported to have sent a separate telegram clarifying this matter. According to the international principles of non-extradition of political prisoners and non-extradition of nationals, our country cannot allow the Japanese to arrest him freely. In order to comply with the agreement on the recovery of the Mixed Court, the French authorities should not have allowed the Japanese side to arrest and hand over our nationals without trial by the Chinese courts. It is heard that the French consul later excused himself, saying that Ahn Chang-ho did not declare himself to be Chinese at the time, and there was no supporting evidence, which is difficult to believe and is certainly not reasonable. The Japanese have brazenly taken Ahn Chang-ho to their country without any regard. If our government tolerates this, not only will our legal rights be infringed upon, but it will also make small and weak nations feel disheartened. It is proposed that your esteemed Yuan and Ministry make a serious protest to the French and Japanese ambassadors, ordering them to return Ahn Chang-ho. Whether he is involved in the bomb incident should be investigated and handled by our courts to avoid setting a bad precedent in international law and causing criticism from both China and foreign countries. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully."</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu and Chen Gongbo</h3>
<p>Leave Shanghai for Nanjing One After the Other</p>
<p>Fundraising for the Ministry of Industry Shows Promise</p>
<p>Minister of Communications Chen Mingshu and Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo left Shanghai for Nanjing in the early mornings of the past two days after their previous visit to Shanghai. Minister of Communications Chen Mingshu stayed in Shanghai for about a week. Before going to Hangzhou (the 10th), he once visited and spoke with Mr. Sun Zhesheng. It is heard that Sun only stated that the program for resisting Japan and saving the country that he proposed was merely a contribution of opinions to the central government, and that the drafting of this program was entirely based on the conversations and opinions exchanged with President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei during his visit to Shanghai. As for the rumors of meetings in Hangzhou, those close to Sun said that this matter has now become a thing of the past. Sun had this intention when publishing the program for resisting Japan and saving the country, but he has now completely abandoned it. Although Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo did not specifically visit Sun, they did meet once. Chen's visit to Shanghai was not solely for the purpose of visiting Sun. His main task, it is heard, was to raise funds from the industrial sector, and it is also heard that after contact with the industrial sector, there has been some progress. Chen felt that his mission had come to an end, so he boarded a ship with Foreign Affairs Committee member Jiang Zuobin the night before last, and left Shanghai for Nanjing yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations Telegraph the National Government</h3>
<p>Reiterating the Request to Recover Lost Territories</p>
<p>The various trade associations in the city telegraphed the National Government in Luoyang yesterday, saying: "To the National Government in Luoyang: The Northeast has been lost for half a decade. Our patriotic self-defense volunteer armies have been fighting bitterly in the White Mountains and Black Waters. As one falls, another rises, becoming more and more fierce. If the authorities provide financial and material support and unified command, then there would be no puppet regime in Southern Mongolia long ago. Not doing so has allowed the puppet regime to grow larger and stronger, forming a situation where it is too late to stop it from becoming a snake. Now that the invading Japanese soldiers in Shanghai have been transferred north, the atmosphere at the customs has suddenly become tense. The volunteer armies in the Northeast are fearful of the morning dew, and the provinces of Hebei and Shandong feel even more at risk. This is exactly what the Grand Master Jia called the time to cry bitterly and sigh deeply. Looking around the country, the military clamor in Guangzhou and the scholastic debates in Taishan have not forgotten the struggle for petty gains, as if they do not know that there is a national crisis at hand. Alas, the bronze camel will meet you in the thorns! It is necessary to mend the fold after losing the sheep, and it is not too late to take action at sunset. At this time, when the hearts of the people in the Northeast have not completely died, and the Japanese troops have not yet concentrated, we still hope that you will quickly mobilize the elite troops in the Southeast, order the generals to go out of the pass, drive out the ugly captives, and return our mountains and rivers. You will see that the compatriots in the Northeast will rejoice at the restoration of the Han palace rituals, and will welcome the teachers with pots of rice soup. The people in the rear will also be fortunate that the descendants of the gods and emperors have not perished, and will destroy their homes to relieve the national crisis. Then the invaders will not be enough to pacify, and the shame will not be difficult to erase. The continuation of the country's destiny and the survival of the nation depend on this one move. Please do not regard it as fodder and treat it lightly. The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry Trade Association, the Color Printing Industry Trade Association, the Shanghai Sales of Lime Trade Association, the Shanghai Mineral Ash Factory Trade Association, the Sugar Industry Trade Association, the Intestine Industry Trade Association, the Brick and Ash Industry Trade Association, the Ramie Bag Industry Trade Association, the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Trade Association, the Paper Industry Trade Association, the Silk and Satin Industry Trade Association, the Yarn Industry Trade Association, the Waste Cotton Industry Trade Association, the Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Trade Association, and the Electrical Appliance Industry Trade Association respectfully."</p>
<h3>Northeast Fellow-Villagers Association Asks for Aid to the Volunteer Armies</h3>
<p>Tea Party to be Convened This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Northeast Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai issued a public notice requesting all sectors to aid the Northeast Volunteer Armies, stating: "The Northeast has been lost for eight months, and 30 million people are living under the trampling of Japanese imperialism every day. The government has consistently pursued a policy of non-resistance. The people of the Northeast, unable to endure any longer, realized that self-help was the only way to survive, and organized volunteer armies to fight against Japanese imperialism. However, the government ordered the prohibition of the organization of volunteer armies and obstructed the spiritual and material assistance of the people throughout the country to the Northeast Volunteer Armies. For several months, the Northeast Volunteer Armies have been fighting in difficult and arduous wars, suffering the slaughter of the violent Japanese and the destruction of Chinese traitors. They have been able to persevere and fight on, seeking liberation for the Chinese nation. This is due to the bravery of the soldiers and the support of the people throughout the country. Now, the violent Japanese are coveting the pass, and Tianjin and Beijing are in danger. The Shanghai Truce Agreement has been signed, and the government is willing to sell out the victory bought with the blood and flesh of the anti-Japanese soldiers of the 19th Route Army, and to sell out Shanghai, which controls the military and commercial lifeline of the whole country. The people of Shanghai will follow the people of the Northeast as slaves to a foreign country. Our association is organized by the Northeast people living in Shanghai. We have personally suffered the pain of losing our country and have no home to return to. The land where we reside has been sold by the government. Under the government's so-called long-term resistance, the Truce Agreement is a prelude to the future loss of the Northeast, and the people of the Northeast are a model for all the people of Shanghai and China. Our association deeply knows that the Japanese imperialists cannot be driven out of the country unless the people automatically arm themselves. Therefore, entrusted by 30 million people in the Northeast and the Northeast Volunteer Armies, we are conveying the oppression and hardship of the anti-Japanese war to the patriotic compatriots in Shanghai, requesting assistance and guidance from all sectors. We have decided to convene a tea party at our association's office at 25 Jiani Lane, Tongfu Road, at 2:00 PM on May 19. We hope that all sectors will attend enthusiastically and carry out practical assistance measures, so that the Northeast Volunteer Armies will have sufficient strength to drive out the violent Japanese and protect the Northeast, which is to protect the whole country. Our association has high hopes."</p>

<h3>Issue of Restoring Sino-Russian Relations</h3>
<p>Opinion of a Certain Important Diplomatic Figure</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important diplomatic figure said that relations between China and the Soviet Union have been intermittent for several years. The Sino-Soviet conference has stalled, not only due to the Manchurian Incident, but also because the contents of the three matters of the Eastern Railway, restoration of communications, and commerce are complex and cannot be resolved in the short term. The Central Government is carefully studying the major policy toward Russia. Although there has been some indirect contact recently, it has not yet materialized. The outside world believes that restoring relations with Russia is tantamount to accommodating communism, but this is not the case. Many countries that have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union do not accommodate communism, and this is one example. However, there is a prerequisite for restoring relations with Russia: mutual recognition that it does not hinder the political security and social organization of each country. The basis of diplomatic relations should be built on mutual commerce and the restoration of normal diplomatic relations, such as embassies and consulates, so that the consulates in the border provinces of Eastern Province and the coastal provinces of the Soviet Union, which have been de facto closed since 1930, are willing to be restored. Therefore, restoring diplomatic relations with Russia today is not difficult in exchanging a document, but the difficulty lies in whether the prerequisite is acceptable to the other party. The Mo representative sent a telegram from Brussels, saying that he is planning a trip to Paris. If the Central Government decides on a major policy toward Russia, Mo can return to Russia and deal with the Soviet authorities. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Refutation of Russian Newspaper Editorial</h3>

The spokesperson also mentioned the issue of restoring Sino-Russian relations, saying that the tone of the Russian newspaper's remarks made it difficult to promote friendly relations between the two countries.

<h3>Central Government Office in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government Office in Nanjing held the 16th anniversary commemoration of Mr. Chen Yinghshi's martyrdom on the morning of the 18th. More than 500 people attended, including Central Committee members Zhang Ji, Wang Zhaoming, Jiang Zhongzheng, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, Shao Yuanchong, Qin Zhen, and Chen Shuren, as well as staff and guests. Ju Zheng presided and Shao Yuanchong gave a report, briefly saying that recalling the tragic death of Mr. Yinghshi in Shanghai in 1916 made them feel very sad and inspired. After the failure of the Second Revolution in 1913, many comrades lost their courage. Only Mr. Yinghshi recognized the cause of the failure and strongly helped President Sun Yat-sen reorganize the Chinese Revolutionary Party, which was established in 1914. After returning to China from Japan, Mr. Yinghshi immediately engaged in preparing for activities in the Northeast and then went to Shanghai to preside over military affairs along the Yangtze River coast, vowing never to flee overseas again. At that time, Shanghai was under the military pressure of Yuan Shikai, and the environment was very bad. However, Mr. Yinghshi had made the greatest determination and courage and had no intention of retreating or shrinking back. At that time, some comrades in the headquarters could not understand Mr. Yinghshi's difficulties, and some comrades in Shanghai also organized separate activities, which greatly affected the revolutionary movement led by Mr. Yinghshi. Mr. Yinghshi had already made the determination to die for the country and fight forward. After the failure of the Zhaohuo warship uprising in December 1915, the revolution became even more difficult. Chen was willing to sacrifice his own life to promote the success of the revolution. On this day in 1916, Chen was killed in Shanghai by Li Haiqiu, a member of the rebel party, who was instructed by Yuan Shikai, Feng Guozhang, Zhang Zongchang, and others, and orchestrated seven or eight murderers to break into his residence. Mr. Chen died for the country in a very short time. Mr. Chen's determination to die for the country is the foundation of the spirit of all revolutionary comrades and the key to the success of the revolutionary party. Mr. Chen believed in the principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and practiced them diligently, giving them a model instruction. They should have revolutionary confidence and courage to make the foundation of all activities. The revival of the Chinese nation must be based on the President's revolutionary strategy and principles in order to succeed. The President advocated the revolutionary army movement, not hoping to succeed in his own lifetime, but only to point out to the people of the country a broad road to save the country and the people. Under the guidance of the President's spirit, revolutionary comrades should have confidence and courage, be determined to succeed or die, follow in the footsteps of the martyrs, and move forward bravely. Then they will not fear how strong the reactionary forces are or how dangerous the country is. They can remove all obstacles and achieve great success. They commemorate Mr. Chen and, of course, are sad, but they should encourage each other in this spirit of sadness, cultivate and train themselves, and can complete the success of the future revolution.

<p>British Government Decides</p>
<h3>To Complete Singapore Naval Base</h3>
<p>Prime Minister of New Zealand Declares</p>
<p>Reuters, Wellington, 18th. New Zealand Prime Minister Forbes declared here today that the Singapore naval base must be built. A firm decision has now been made, and the New Zealand government does not wish to reduce its share of the expenses. He also stated that the Parliamentary Expenditure Committee proposed that New Zealand's naval defenses be handed over to the British government, but the New Zealand government decided not to accept this proposal.</p>
<h3>Belgian Cabinet Resigns</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Brussels, 17th. The Belgian cabinet resigned today due to the long-standing dispute over the use of the Flemish language. The Belgian people consist of two groups: the Flemish and the Walloons (descendants of the Salian Franks residing in northern Flanders). The Flemish speak Flemish, and their numbers are slightly greater than the Walloons. Belgium has traditionally used French as the official language, but after the Flemish fought for it, both French and Flemish were used as official languages.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Brussels, 17th. Although the language issue is the reason for the resignation of the Belgian cabinet, it is now believed that the recent discovery by Parliament that Belgian Prime Minister Renkin was involved in a corruption case concerning the construction of the Antwerp Canal is not unrelated to the cabinet's resignation.</p>

<p>After Conflicts Between Hindus and Muslims</p>
<h3>A desolate scene in Bombay</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 18th. After dusk last night, the entire city was silent. Theaters and restaurants were closed, and there were no pedestrians on the streets. Every few steps, British soldiers stood in the shadows. The usually bustling area now presents a desolate scene. What makes people still remember the terror of the past three days of unrest are the fires that can be seen everywhere on the streets, still smoldering, and the broken storefronts and the scattered items on the road. Boxes and other items are piled up everywhere on the main streets, as if commemorating a dishonorable outburst.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 17th. Conflicts between Hindus and Muslims here since last Saturday and Sunday have resulted in 88 deaths and 850 injuries. However, after the deployment of British troops, the situation has calmed down somewhat. Although Muslims still occasionally fight with Hindus while celebrating the New Year, the authorities have gradually been able to maintain order. The police and soldiers have shown no bias towards either religious group. An order has been issued prohibiting nighttime travel and gatherings of more than five people. During a parade by Muslims in Calcutta today, they were pelted with stones by Hindus, causing a conflict. Many police officers were also hit by objects while trying to suppress the riot, and more than a dozen civilians were injured. However, order was soon restored.</p>
<h3>Lindbergh is Deceived after Loss of Son</h3>
<p>Reuters, Hopewell, 17th. Amidst the grief of losing his son, the Lindbergh couple was shocked to learn that the person they had entrusted to negotiate with the kidnappers was actually a con artist. This person is Curtis, the "Norfolk Millionaire Shipowner" reported in the newspapers. The Lindbergh couple regarded Curtis as a trustworthy person and trusted him completely, but unexpectedly he took the opportunity to defraud them, causing them to be misled. According to the New Jersey Sheriff, after being interrogated for several hours, Curtis confessed that he had fabricated the story of contacting the kidnappers because a newspaper and a film company offered him a large sum of money for exclusive news about the kidnapping case. Curtis further stated that he had completely written down the beginning and end of his scam on a typewriter at 4:00 this morning and sent it to the sheriff. He claimed that his shipbuilding business had gone bankrupt last year, and he had been experiencing financial difficulties recently. He admitted that he had been blinded by greed and had done something inhumane, which was not his original intention. The New Jersey Sheriff stated that the police department's investigation was disrupted by Curtis's scam, and the detectives had to make many unnecessary trips, and Colonel Lindbergh was unable to stay home and handle everything during the most important period.</p>
<p>Gogulov</p>
<h3>Mental Derangement Before the Assassination</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 17th. Gogulov, the assassin of French President Doumer, was subjected to a rigorous interrogation again today. According to the results, the French authorities now believe that the case was the result of an individual's actions and was not related to any political organization or movement. Gogulov no longer exhibits manic behavior and freely answers all questions. It is said that since he arrived in Paris three days before the assassination, he had been in a daze all day, his mind filled with the idea of assassinating the president and killing himself with the last bullet. Sometimes he was slightly more lucid and decided to abandon this sinister plan, praying at Notre Dame Cathedral. At other times, he drank heavily, hoping to forget everything. Even before the assassination, he drank several bottles of brandy in several cafes, hoping that he could forget his assassination plan after getting drunk. However, he was unable to achieve his wish and shot the president in a drunken stupor. However, he had two guns in his pocket at the time and had completely forgotten which gun he used to carry out the assassination. As for his motive for the assassination, it was because France seemed unwilling to attack Soviet Russia, which made him extremely angry and mad. He believed that the French president represented the French government, so he wanted to die with him.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on</h3>
<p>The Imminence of a US-Japan War</p>
<p>This article first discusses the difficulties of the United States in fighting in the Pacific. First, the morale of the navy is weak. Second, the strength of the fleet is insufficient. Third, the fleet is difficult to mobilize and coordinate, giving the impression that it is vulnerable to attack. Next, it discusses the US naval exercises as a challenge to Japan. The US changing its planned course of action and stationing its fleet indefinitely in the Pacific is something the Japanese cannot tolerate. The danger in US-Japan relations is clear from this article.</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun published an article by Tadataka Ikezeki on the 12th of this month, entitled "The Fateful US-Japan War." The article is very long. Here is the translation:</p>
<p>According to a Washington dispatch on April 14, the United States is holding large-scale naval exercises in the Pacific, with all US fleets participating. At the same time, the US State Department plans to have the reconnaissance fleet dispatched from the Atlantic to guard the Pacific indefinitely after the end of the exercises. It has consulted the naval authorities on this idea. Although the naval authorities have not yet formally ordered its implementation, they are already preparing for it. This US naval exercise is commanded by General Schofield, and it will be based on the idea of holding a joint army and navy defense exercise centered on the US Pacific coast and the Hawaiian Islands on February 6. Therefore, its scale is larger than the naval exercises held in 1925. According to the New York Times, the exercise will continue for 97 days from February 6 to May 13, divided into three phases. The first phase is from February 6 to February 11. The Pacific Coast Battle Fleet and the army forces stationed in Hawaii will participate in a joint army and navy defense exercise centered on Hawaii. The second phase is from March 8 to March 23. The Battle Fleet departing from Hawaii will advance toward the US West Coast to obtain a base. After March 8, the reconnaissance fleet scheduled to arrive in the waters between San Francisco and Vancouver will practice resisting real combat. The third phase is from March 23 to May 13. After the end of the second phase, the Battle Fleet and the Reconnaissance Fleet will be combined to conduct fleet concentration exercises and various combat skills training in the waters off San Francisco and Vancouver. According to the planned schedule, the Reconnaissance Fleet of the Atlantic forces of the US Combined Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Vitter, will also set sail from its various bases in the Atlantic, call at Guantanamo, the US Navy's winter base in Cuba, and conduct shooting exercises. In early March, the air squadron and destroyer squadron, which took separate actions from the main force, will gather at the port of Vancouver, a base on the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>However, according to the telegram issued on April 14, the planned schedule seems to have been changed, and the three phases of the exercise have ended. What kind of effect the sudden shortening of the implementation period of the large-scale exercise has is not something that can be guessed. It is rumored that many sailors believed that war with Japan would break out during the large-scale exercise, and they were quite worried. As a result, as many as 1,500 crew members deserted from the US fleet. In addition, the battle fleet moored in Hawaii had an inappropriate incident involving soldiers landing on the island, which led to the issue of prohibiting landings. From this point of view, the weakening of the morale of the US fleet is difficult to deny. What I (Ikezaki) want to point out urgently is that the US State Department suddenly declared that after the large-scale exercise, the reconnaissance fleet dispatched from the Atlantic will be deployed indefinitely in the Pacific, which is unprecedented. We speculate that they must believe that an accident will occur in the Pacific, or that an accident will brew in the Pacific. Therefore, this action is a strategy to threaten the opposing enemy. The actions expressed by the US government have gone beyond the norm, and holding naval exercises is even more of an extraordinary action. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Changes Policy Toward Russia</h3>
<p>Striving to Eliminate Misunderstandings</p>
<p>First Achieve Economic Compromise</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reports that after Foreign Minister Yoshizawa obtained a detailed report from former Ambassador to Russia Tatsukichi Tanaka after his return from an inspection of Manchuria, he urgently wanted to change his policy toward Russia in view of the deterioration of the situation in the Far East in order to avoid unrest in Northern Manchuria. At present, in order to establish a policy toward Russia, there are two opinions among influential people within the government on how to deal with it: (1) The issue of a non-aggression treaty with Russia: Before this kind of political issue is resolved, it is advocated that an economic policy toward Russia be established first, but a gradual approach is adopted for economic issues with Russia, and a wait-and-see attitude is still taken; (2) General policy toward Russia: The government strives to eliminate the causes of misunderstandings between the two countries and improve the national relations between the two countries. (Note: At present, Japan's enemies are Russia and the United States. Since Russia concentrated a large army on the border of Northern Manchuria, the situation between Japan and Russia has suddenly become dangerous, but the anti-American sentiment in Japan is more severe than the anti-Russian sentiment. If Japan wants to start a war with the United States, it has to ease relations with Russia. This change in policy toward Russia is a preparation for actively opposing the United States.)</p>

<h3>Coveting the Resources of Mongolia and Manchuria</h3>
<p>Also Sends People to Mongolia to Explore Resources 　　Decides to Exploit Manchurian Aluminum Ore 　　Dalian Communication: The Japanese are extremely meticulous in their reconnaissance of Mongolia and Manchuria. Last year there was Nakamura, and this year there is Matsui, who entered Mongolia and Manchuria to explore. Now there are also Kirita and Ikemoto, who are going to Mongolia to search for all kinds of materials. The two are preparing to depart, starting last November. This February, they will actually set off from Nagoya, Japan, and go to Inner Mongolia on foot. They arrived in Hamgyongnam-do, Korea on April 3, and departed from Hoeryong, Korea on the morning of the 5th, passing through Yanji to enter Dunhua, and crossing the large forest of the Furul Ridge. They are expected to cross Qiqihar and the Hinggan Mountains in October of this year, and arrive in Mongolia in December. They plan to return to Liaoning in July next year. The journey is a total of 4,134 kilos, and the work schedule is estimated to be 430 days. I hope that our compatriots will pay close attention to it.</p>
<p>Aluminum is an important raw material for manufacturing aircraft. At present, military and civilian aircraft in various countries around the world mostly use aluminum to manufacture their bodies and wings. This mineral is extremely precious in the world. Except for the United States and France, other countries have not seen much of it. Northeast China is rich in this mineral, and the Japanese have been coveting it for many years. Now, in preparation for actual mining, the Japanese government has sent Dr. Takaoka, director of the Osaka Municipal Industrial Research Institute, to Northeast China to investigate and conduct field tests. It is reported that the mining areas have been discovered, including Fuzhou, Daweijiadun, Benxihu, Yantai, and Tian Yang Fu Man. The total reserves in these five locations are 150 million tons, with a mineral composition of approximately 40%, and a large amount of potassium sulfate can be extracted. All of the aluminum materials currently used in Japan are imported from France, with an annual demand of 12,000 tons, costing more than 10 million yuan. The reason why the Japanese are eager to exploit the aluminum ore in Northeast China is that, on the one hand, they can stop the outflow of economic resources, and on the other hand, they can gain a great military advantage. If all five of these mining areas are exploited, they can supply the entire world for 200 years. (May 14)</p>

<p>Full text of Ma Zhanshan's telegram to Director Zhang Suijing, please forward to Chairman Lytton and all members of the League of Nations Investigation Team: My previous telegram was brief and the meaning unclear. Now, I will further explain to your team. Since the Japanese invasion of the Northeast, they know that their violent aggression is unacceptable to the civilized international community of the 20th century. They use sophistry to deceive the world, repeatedly claiming that they are dispatching troops to protect expatriates or that China is unable to curb the redization of Soviet Russia and must take action to prevent it in order to contain the chaos in the world. However, in reality, local officials in various places have spared no effort to protect expatriates in China. Even though the public deeply resent the Japanese for their various acts of brutality and unreasonableness, and there are occasional boycotts, the government has always curbed these actions to prevent them from exceeding the limit. As a result, no Japanese expatriates have been killed. Even after the September 18th Incident in Liaoning last year, our country still protected non-combatant Japanese as usual. This shows that China has always valued justice and humanity, does not harbor revenge, and can endure what others cannot. The League of Nations is far away in Geneva and may not be aware of these details. However, the consuls of the British and American embassies and the resident groups in Harbin have conducted actual investigations. The envoys have reported fairly on their visits to places as far west as Manzhouli. On the other hand, the Japanese have massacred our innocent civilians, such as in the Jinan Massacre and the Wanbaoshan Korean Incident, killing thousands at a time. The massacres in Liaoning last year, and the killings of civilians in Shanghai Jiangwan, Zhabei, etc., this year, are all inhumane acts that have been seen and heard by the international community. As for redization, the Chinese government has always adopted a policy of active prevention. The Northeast borders Soviet Russia, especially Heilongjiang Province, where the border is contiguous. The prevention is tight, and the inspection of red literature and printed matter is strict to prevent them from flowing in. Commerce is also being considered, and a blockade policy is still in effect. I, Zhanshan, have been governing the army along the border for many years and have strictly prohibited redization. The people along the border also regard redization as terrible and avoid it like snakes and scorpions. For example, during the Nenjiang Bridge battle, the Japanese side claimed that our army had the assistance of Soviet Russia. In fact, not only were there no Soviet Russian officers participating in the entire army, but there were also no White Russians joining. The Soviet Russian side also felt that they were too busy to take care of themselves and tried their best to avoid any suspicion of joining hands with us. It can be seen that the Japanese propaganda is purely to deceive the world. Our country has a real grasp of preventing redization and does not need the Japanese to overstep their bounds and plan for us. This time, I, Zhanshan, saw through the Japanese conspiracy and, in order to save the country, led troops to Heihe to carry out righteous resistance. The Japanese then spread propaganda that it was related to a certain country, disregarding our nation's inability to resist. If there is resistance, it is said that there must be external forces. As a great power, they have resorted to such rogue propaganda to deceive the world and disrupt peace. They do not know that in recent years, the world view and national thought of the Chinese people are completely different from the time when the Boxers disturbed the country thirty years ago. Anyone from other countries who is slightly familiar with the Chinese situation will be able to understand the Japanese embellishments and sophistry, which are nothing more than tools for aggression and will be self-defeating. The League of Nations is the only arbitration mechanism for maintaining world peace. The investigation team bears the important mission of coming to China to investigate, nothing more than to understand the details and truth. It is hoped that the most accurate observations will be made and the most impartial report will be issued, so that ambitious countries will not be able to achieve their cunning plans. This will not only solve the Sino-Japanese problem, but also ensure lasting world peace. The various contracts and agreements that the Japanese forced upon us but have not been signed are listed separately on the left for your inspection.</p>

<p>Local Communication</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Joint Military and Police Office Will Postpone Its Closure After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, military and police agencies in Suzhou jointly formed a joint office to maintain security in Suzhou. Jin Deyang, the commander of the 1st Gendarmerie Regiment, was publicly elected as the director. The joint office was ordered to close a week ago, but due to concerns about security in the rear, the current situation will be temporarily maintained. Now, an order has been received from General Cai to postpone the closure, and Commander Shen of the 60th Division has sent a company of soldiers to be directed by Jin Guochang to assist in maintaining local order.</p>
<h3>Imprisonment for Counterfeiting Tickets The Minsheng Printing House on Jingde Road, Suzhou City</h3>
<p>The Minsheng Printing House on Jingde Road, Suzhou City, counterfeited public bond tickets last year. Later, the Ministry of Finance found out and sent personnel to secretly investigate and verify the facts. They telegraphed the Wu County Public Security Bureau to arrest Cha Nianchun, the director of the printing house, and seized a large number of printed public bond tickets. The Public Security Bureau immediately sent Cha to the Wu County Local Court for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday, the court pronounced its verdict, sentencing Cha Nianchun to three years of fixed-term imprisonment and a fine of 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>

<p>Sheng County</p>
<h3>Banditry in the Northwest and Southwest is Getting Worse In Sheng County, Zhejiang Province,</h3>
<p>the mountains are complex, transportation is obstructed, and bandits appear and disappear unpredictably. After the disbandment of Zhou Fengqi's troops last year, they sneaked into the county, kidnapped people for ransom, and were extremely fierce. Later, the Director of Security, Yan Wutao, led a team to the county to recruit them. The bandit leaders surrendered one after another, but their remaining bandits were not accustomed to military life and continued to rob in the east, west, south, and north. Zhu sent informants to Ying Weishui and tried his best to arrest them. The banditry was slightly suppressed. Unexpectedly, in April, a bandit named Fei gathered more than 200 people and carried out a large-scale robbery. Wealthy households in Baini Dun, Fushunjiang, and Liangtoumen in Chongren Town in the west received threatening letters one after another. The bandits were fully equipped with military uniforms and traveled between towns and villages during the day. The patrol team in the city did not dare to go out to suppress them due to the small number of people. County Magistrate Jian Tielang was deeply afraid that the bandits would invade the city and closed the city gates tightly every evening. At present, the provincial government has not sent troops to rescue them, so the northwest and southwest are in a state of extreme terror. Recently, there have been rumors of looting the entire town of Chongren, so the residents there are extremely panicked.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The Government Returned Xiaozhuang Normal School</h3>
<p>Preparing for a Children's Science Summer School</p>
<p>The Nanjing Xiaozhuang Normal School, run by Tao Xingzhi, advocated rural experimental education and achieved remarkable results. For a time, schools across the country took it as a model, and many followed suit. In recent years, Mr. Tao has felt even more that to save the country and the people, it is necessary to promote scientific knowledge and skills, so that our nation has scientific knowledge and skills in order to adapt to modern life and survive in the modern world. The fundamental way to promote the scientific intelligence of the nation is to train children in science. Therefore, Mr. Tao has gathered many comrades in the past year to compile 100 kinds of children's science series, which will be published by the Children's Art Library before this summer. At this time, the government has clearly ordered the return of Xiaozhuang Normal School. Elementary schools and kindergartens within 40 miles around Xiaozhuang have opened one after another, and it has been decided to establish a large-scale children's science summer school in Xiaozhuang from July 15 to August 15, specializing in the study of children's natural science with a quota of 1,000 people. Recruit university graduates, science teachers from various normal schools, and teachers from various elementary schools. The city and county supervisors will study separately and hope that summer schools for children's science research will appear in the township next summer. After one year, the proposition of children's natural science can be promoted throughout the country. The summer school research courses are divided into ten types: (1) Children's Biology, (2) Children's Chemistry, (3) Children's Earth, (4) Children's Physics, (5) Children's Astronomy, (6) Children's Geometry, (7) Children's Agronomy, (8) Children's Crafts, (9) Children's Physiology and Hygiene, (10) Children's Science Guidance.</p>
<h3>Children's Savings to Build Ships to Save the Country</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Advocated Changing to Building Military Aircraft</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department submitted the articles of association of the Hangzhou Branch of the China Children's Savings to Build Ships to Save the Country Association and a book on children's warships, requesting the Ministry of Education to order all provinces and cities to follow suit. The Ministry of Education greatly appreciated the association's painstaking efforts, but believed that building military aircraft was better than building warships, and hoped that the association would formulate detailed plans and measures before it could be implemented from theory. It is also hoped that the method of keeping the savings will be properly formulated.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Educational Undertakings After January 28th (7) Still</h3>
<p>Two Institutions Set Up Cram Schools… Boy Scouts are Commendable for Their Loyalty and Bravery</p>
<h3>7. Remedial Classes During the War</h3>
<p>Since the enemy troops pressed into Shanghai, all education, whether in the war zone or non-war zone, whether in universities or elementary schools, was in a state of suspension. Especially university education. Therefore, the Business School of Central University added remedial night classes, the Shanghai YMCA prepared university cram schools, and the Chinese Vocational Education College attached university and middle school remedial courses to relieve those young men and women who were hungry for knowledge.</p>
<p>Now, let us introduce the content and methods of the university and middle school remedial courses attached to the Chinese Vocational Education Society, so as to understand the general situation of Shanghai's cram schools after January 28th. At the same time, we pray that the Chinese people will strive for success so as not to have another tragedy like this of temporarily embracing Buddha's feet. The purpose of the remedial courses attached to the Vocational Education Society is, needless to say, to relieve the general out-of-school youth, so that the youth have the opportunity to learn, so as to avoid wasting their studies and wasting time. The level is divided into two groups in the undergraduate course, one is for students in the first and second grades of the university, and one group is for students in the second and third grades of high school. Subjects: The middle school group sets up four subjects: Chinese, English, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. Scholars are also invited to give special lectures. The university group sets up four subjects: Chinese, English, Mathematics, Social Science (including Political Science, Economics, Education, and Sociology), and scholars are also invited to give special lectures. The class period is tentatively set for four months, from March 1st to June 30th. The teaching time is six days a week for each group, and four hours of classes a day. The university group is from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm, and the middle school group is from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm. The quota is tentatively set at 100 middle school students and 50 university students, both male and female. If each group is less than 35 people, the class will not be opened. Tuition: University students pay 30 yuan, and middle school students pay 24 yuan. A fee for handouts will be charged at the discretion of those who use handouts. If the war ends and the schools open, it will be stopped immediately. The tuition fee will be refunded proportionally according to the date of instruction. Registration: Those who are interested in learning can report to the Chinese Vocational Education Society at the intersection of Hualong Road and Huanlong Road from February 23rd to February 29th, and pay a registration fee of 5 yuan, which will be deducted from the tuition fee. The school will start on March 1st. Certificates: At the end of June, students who pass the exam will receive a certificate of completion. They have seven members: Jiang Wenyu, Yang Weiyu, Chen Xuanshan, Shen Yougan, Pan Wenan, Jia Foru, and Wu Cuilun. Chen Xuanshan presides over the teaching affairs. They received a total of 154 male students and 35 female students. The university group did not open a class because the number of people was not enthusiastic. An extra junior high school class was added, which was a later change.</p>
<p>The YMCA's university cram school is located in the French Concession's Baixianqiao. Chen Liting is in charge of all affairs, and university professors such as Pan Guangdan and Xie Xunchu help him to succeed. Liu Zhanen, the president of Shanghai University, also took the time to help. Their nature is completely based on the lecture system, which is similar to the "University Free Lecture System" advocated by Liang Qichao in the past. There were more than 130 people who went to listen to the lectures by subject, and they were all good young people who admired that every inch of time is worth every inch of gold. The evening business school added by Shanghai University on Bowuyuan Road is intended to encourage aspiring young people to have remedial intentions, which can be compared with Soochow Law School before and after, and it opened urgently during the war.</p>
<h3>11. Scouting</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, the shocking news that Jin...the rivers and mountains of the Northeast had been lost by soldiers who did not fight and lands that were not defended spread to Shanghai. The reporter proposed to set up a "Scout Battlefield Service Committee" at the council of the highest scouting authority. This committee was established, and it was discussed several times, and everything was prepared. Who knew that they did not go to the Northeast, and nearby Shanghai was as alarmed as the Northeast. On the day after the January 28th Incident, most of the Christians and victims took refuge in the Muer Church, a haven of peace. It was late at night and cold, and many victims could not sleep, and often hugged each other to keep warm. The Muer Church's scouts could not bear to see this tragic situation, and that night they rushed to Jinrong Elementary School to borrow blankets. The beneficiaries still remember this kind deed of giving charcoal in the snow.</p>
<p>Starting from borrowing blankets, the Boy Scouts expanded the scope of services and set off for the battlefield. On January 30th, the coaching team run by the council and the 270th scout regiment of Muer Church began to be active, and recruited more than 600 people who volunteered to join the army, and established the "Battlefield Service Team". Wang Gang was elected as the commander-in-chief, and Xi Xueqiao, Luo Lie, Wang Yiqiao, and girl scout Huang Shan were elected as deputies. Yu Julu, director of the organization department, Chen Tao, director of the general affairs department, Zhu Jiarang, director of the document department, He Jia, director of the propaganda department, Ni Jiaxi, captain of the rescue team, and Feng Zhenwei, captain of the labor team, were also appointed. They went to fight for survival for the motherland with great momentum and to seize the rivers and mountains.</p>
<p>Their rescue work rescued more than 700 compatriots in the front line of Zhabei, like fish out of water and prisoners awaiting execution. They set up 13 refugee shelters in the rear, and served in more than 20 other shelters and hospitals, specializing in the management of security affairs. The vehicles of the 19th Route Army came in and out and the management of comfort items also relied on them, and the order was well-organized.</p>
<p>When the war was raging, there was a shortage of personnel to deliver messages in the front. The scouts immediately selected 12 people who were good at driving skills to form a "Front Message Delivery Team" led by Ni Jiaxi to deliver important documents to the transportation office of the Zhenru Headquarters. They entered and exited the smoke-filled fire, without any fear or trepidation. The planes soared and circled overhead to track them down, and the roar of cannons and the arrows of bullets flew up and down, left and right, shocking them, but they never delayed official business. Commander-in-chief Jiang Guangnai and Commander Cai Tingkai saw their loyalty and bravery and their excellent achievements, and they all applauded and praised them, and asked the scouts to serve in the Nanchang Headquarters. Wang Gang added 25 people and asked Feng Zhenwei to lead them to do the work that people were unwilling to do and dared not do.</p>
<h3>Central University Medical School Largely Destroyed</h3>
<p>As our troops defended the second line of defense, the reception centers set up by the Boy Scouts gradually closed. The remaining scouts and 270 new members were trained by Wang Gang and Zhao Weizu, who taught battlefield skills. They became the third batch of front-line service personnel. Detouring to Kunshan, after being addressed by Tang Dehuang, the chief of the traffic department of the 19th Route Army headquarters, they joined the first and second batches of Boy Scouts in road construction, supervision, bridge building, reconnaissance, transportation, reception, and communication. The installation of telegraph poles and wires from Kunshan to Changshu was all done by them. It is said that they completed this work in a week. The digging of trenches around the city wall of Suzhou was done in cooperation with the Feng Da's Volunteer Army and the Skull Squad. Now, the Boy Scouts are solely responsible. Their communication and reconnaissance areas include Nanjing and the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou roads, where they left many footprints. Their permanent locations are Suzhou, Songjiang, Zhengyi, Kunshan, Wuxi, Nanxiang, and Zhenru. The "Boy Scout Military Affairs Office" is their command center and the general headquarters for issuing orders. The 50th Regiment Boy Scouts of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should operate independently. They have also made many contributions, but unfortunately, several comrades died from stray bullets. The names of these comrades have not yet been discovered. We should silently mourn those who have passed away.</p>
<p>When the League of Nations investigation team arrived in Nanjing, Chairman Lord Lytton did nothing. The first thing he did was to summon the Boy Scouts at the Lixingshe for a lecture. Some important Chinese figures were inevitably surprised. It turned out that Lytton was the forefather of the Boy Scouts and a student of Baden-Powell. Baden-Powell knew that the Chinese Boy Scouts were working hard under the pressure of a strong neighbor and personally wrote a letter to commend and comfort them. Lytton was amazed by the excellence of the Chinese Boy Scouts, which exceeded his expectations, so naturally, he wanted to talk to the loyal and beloved Boy Scouts first. During this time, the enemy's Boy Scouts were also very active in Shanghai. At the end of April, they were summoned by the naval commander, commended, and given souvenirs. After our country's Boy Scouts have contributed so much to the country, it is unknown what the government and society have to say about them. Of course, the service of the Boy Scouts was never to seek others' praise.</p>
<p>Joint meeting, (2) Whether county magistrates should attend the provincial guidance district meeting was decided not to attend. (3) Whether secondary school representatives should join the provincial or provincial district guidance meeting was decided to be discussed at the next meeting. (4) Please specify the liaison between the library and the various levels of guidance meetings, which was decided to be reviewed by Zhang Rentian, Xu Peiye, Lu Mingzhi, Huang Shu, Li Huanbin, Fang Ganmin, and Shen Mingcai and then discussed. (5) The case of adding district chiefs to the attendees of the county and city district guidance meetings was decided to add that the spirits of all members were extremely tense during the discussion until the meeting adjourned at 5:30. Yesterday (17th) at 8:00 AM, Cheng Tianfang, the president of Zhejiang University, gave a lecture on the kinds of education that our country needs now. The third general meeting was at 9:00 AM. At 2:00 PM, Shen Yougan, a professor at Zhejiang University, gave a lecture, and a meeting was held after the lecture.</p>
<h3>Education Circles Initiate Organization</h3>
<h3>China Educational Film Association</h3>
<p>Prominent figures in the education circles, such as Duan Xipeng, Yang Xingfo, Luo Jialun, and Guo Youshou, jointly initiated the organization of the China Educational Film Association. They held a discussion meeting in Beijing on the 11th of this month and have drafted the association's constitution. The content states that the association aims to study and utilize films to assist education, promote culture, and assist the development of the educational film industry. The association's duties include research and improvement of educational films, production matters, investigation and statistics, and promotional matters; cooperation with the film industry in the production of educational films; suggestions to film administrative agencies and handling of entrusted matters from film administrative agencies; collaboration with international educational film agencies; and other matters. The association is located in the capital and may establish branches in various locations. Anyone with specialized research in education, literature, art, and science, or with contributions and experience in film technology and the film industry, may become a member of the association through introduction procedures. The association is currently soliciting members and will convene a general meeting at a later date when a sufficient number of members have been obtained.</p>

<p>Zhejiang University pays great attention to military training for students. However, live-fire exercises have not been held due to the difficulty in borrowing guns and bullets. Now, Hu Zongnan, the commander of the 1st Division, came to Hangzhou on official business and was very concerned about the military training in Hangzhou schools. President Cheng of Zhejiang University specially prepared an official letter, entrusted Instructor Lai, to discuss it in person, asking to borrow dozens of guns and 2,500 bullets for students to practice. Commander Hu has generously agreed to forward the request to Commander Jiang Dingwen and allocate the full amount, which has been handed over yesterday. It is reported that the school plans to hold the exercise in the next few days with the guns and bullets in hand.</p>

<h3>Special Labor Schools Established</h3>
<p>Public Literacy Centers and Free Letter-Writing Services</p>
<p>The ten labor schools established by the Labor Education Committee of this city, except for two or three schools that had to be temporarily relocated due to their location in the war zone after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the other schools are proceeding as usual. The committee, considering the large number of out-of-school children of laborers in Shanghai, found that the original ten schools were insufficient. It was decided at the last committee meeting to add three schools in Gaolangqiao, Meixie Road, and Lujiawan, which have also started classes one after another, and the students are very crowded. The committee has recently considered the inconvenience for the general public in writing letters and asking about words, and has specially established "Public Literacy Centers" and "Free Letter-Writing Services" in each labor school. Those who need it can contact the nearby schools for assistance.</p>
<h3>Merchant Marine School to Open Soon</h3>
<p>The issue of opening the Wusong Merchant Marine School of the Ministry of Communications has been brewing for a long time and has not been resolved. Recently, the student representatives of the school asked that the authorities of the Ministry of Communications in Beijing had approved the dispatch of personnel to investigate and then order the school to open, so there should be no more problems. The representatives returned to Shanghai with Section Chief Feng of the Ministry of Communications on the same day.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Girls' High School Broadcasting and Speech Results</h3>
<p>Wu Zhiqian, the principal of Shanghai Girls' High School, in order to guide students' extracurricular activities and show the results of Mandarin performance, led many students to the Sino-Western Pharmacy broadcasting station the other day to hold the first broadcasting speech, asking the audience to send in evaluations. The results of the audience's evaluation were announced, with Peng Shufang in first place, Jin Jiaoli in second place, and Wu Ying in third place. It is also reported that the school, considering that radio is a powerful tool for expanding civic education, is currently drafting a systematic lecture material for regular lectures.</p>

<p>Correspondence</p>
<h3>To Those Studying in the Soviet Union for Educational Forestry (2)</h3>
<p>(Li Yingong)</p>
<p>(2) Can fallen leaves and pine needles be sold as fuel, and what is the annual amount? (Answer) This is due to a complete lack of knowledge of the mountain forest life in our country. This question was raised by a member at a gathering of social educators in Zhenjiang that I attended some time ago. Because the guests were talking loudly, there was no time to interject and defend, and eventually they all dispersed. Now, it is like having a bone in my throat that I cannot help but spit out. Please tell that person that in the habits of East Asian nations where livelihoods are almost exhausted, there is indeed a way to use fallen leaves and pine needles to replace firewood (all countries that value forests retain the undergrowth as natural fertilizer, referred to as ForestFloor). This custom has not been completely eliminated to this day. However, how often have you seen a mountain owner or landlord collect and sell them in the market? Not only is this impossible, but may I ask, in the educational forest areas, which mountain grasses are not open to the villagers without conditions every year from September to October, allowing them to pick them up without taking a penny? Even this is not easy to win the favor of the villagers around the forest. Even in areas such as Jiangnan Tangshan Second Forest Farm, it is necessary to open it twice a year. In the Xiaojiuhua District of the Central Model Forest, because of refusing this custom, it evolved into a disturbance that destroyed the district office and injured the police. If all mountain forest products were valued and priced like in the city, then the income of the by-products in the district I was inspecting would not have amounted to only 16,840 yuan and 43 cents. In my opinion, it was the result of exhausting my efforts and increasing it year by year. Some people in the Soviet Union may despise it as insignificant. Could it be that there is a preconceived notion of distrusting people from other provinces in their minds?</p>
<p>(3) Although the trees have not yet reached maturity, why can't a portion be harvested and sold to provide funds for use? (Answer) Any measures that do not conform to the principles of forest management can be corrected by passersby. Now, how can there be any value in discussing proposals that violate the laws of nature? The circumference of young tree stems is narrow, unlike the trunks of middle-aged and older trees, which can be several feet in circumference. Therefore, the volume of a measured year ring can exceed ten times and is not yet complete. Therefore, a forestry enterprise must be wealthy and patient to wait until the highest rate of growth before harvesting. (Note that each tree species has its highest rate of growth in a year, and beyond this, it gradually decreases, like a Curueline of market prices in economics. This situation varies depending on climate and soil, and depending on seeds, so it needs to be tested before it can be said with certainty.) Moreover, the growth rate of single and upright trees is far less than that of forest trees, which cannot be expected to be understood by everyone. Now, the property values of each educational forest area have long been recorded in tree surveys, sampling diagrams of the material growth of major tree species, and zoning forest maps. Therefore, the operations are as clear as the palm of one's hand, and there are designated areas for testing new methods, such as direct sowing, from broadleaf to coniferous trees, cluster afforestation methods, tending methods without pruning, grafting methods, cutting experiments, adaptation experiments for mixed forests, and the trial planting of more than ninety new tree species from Sichuan and Kang… etc. In terms of age, the largest forests have just reached their peak. How can one suddenly expect them to be produced and sold, which is like expecting a three-foot-tall child to be a pillar of the family? It is difficult to do so. In general, the proper way to cultivate a forest is to introduce a source of benefits that lasts for a long time. If this can be done, then farmland will be directly and indirectly affected and avoid crop failure. The hundred industries of the surrounding villages can also rely on it to flourish day by day. In the past, the manager of the Chongyalou Forest Garden in Wuning, Jiangxi, the supervisor of the Linmu Farm in Yixing Huxiazhen, the representative of the Fulou Company in Tianwang Temple, Jurong, and the owner of the Jiufeng Forest Farm in Xishan, Beiping, all came to inquire, and I told them all the same purpose in writing, and I was happy to do my best to advise those who were engaged in this industry.</p>

<h3>Record of the Jiangnan Sports School Games</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Jiangnan Sports School on Hede Road in this city has been very strict with its internal and external field courses, and the equipment is also striving to be complete. In order to increase the interest in track and field competitions, the school specially held a joint sports meeting of the dormitories at the school's new track and field field yesterday afternoon. The dormitories were the units, and they were divided into the first dormitory, the second dormitory, the third dormitory, and the fourth dormitory. All preparations, arrangements, and evaluation work were assigned by the school and were performed by the students to gain practical experience. Yesterday's field was muddy due to the rain the night before, and the results of both track and field events were diminished. As a result of the competition, the third dormitory won the championship with sixty-two points, the fourth dormitory won the second place with fifty-one points, the second dormitory won the third place with twenty-three points, and the first dormitory won the fourth place with twenty-one points. The results of each event are listed below: Event First Place Second Place Third Place Fourth Place Result 100 meters Chen Jiezhang Chen Yaoji Zhang Kan Yang Xiumu 12.9 seconds 200 meters Chen Jiezhang Lin Zhengzhong Chen Yaoji Yang Xiumu 26.2 seconds 200 meters Xiang Zhongling Lin Zhengzhong Fang Wentong Liang Zhong 59.4 seconds 800 meters Xiang Zhongling Xi Shangxiu Jiang Yongjian Luo Guiwu 2 minutes 25.5 seconds 5,500 meters Zhu Shaohua Chen Jiezhang Xiang Zhongling Fang Wentong 4 minutes 43 seconds 16-pound shot put Lin Xi Huang Qihuan Wang Huating Jiang Shouyuan 9.23 meters Discus Lin Xi Chen Changwen Huang Qihuan Jiang Huating 27.85 meters Javelin Yang Xu Feng Chen Changwen Jiang Shouyuan Jiang Yongjian 34.89 meters High Jump Chen Changwen Huang Jiazuo Lin Xi Zhang Kan 1.52 meters Long Jump Chen Changwen Lin Xi Yang Xu Feng Zhang Kan 5.78 meters Triple Jump Yang Xu Feng Wang Depu Gu Daoyun Liang Zhong 11.37 meters Pole Vault Gu Daobao Gu Qixuan Fang Wentong Yang Xu Feng 2.64 meters</p>

<h3>National Goods Promotion Association Holds Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Regarding the goods stored at the Zhabei National Exhibition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens National Goods Promotion Association led various factories to hold the Zhabei National Exhibition on January 15. Affected by the invasion of the brutal Japanese army, it was suspended midway, and all the goods were stored in the Yuyetang, heavily locked and carefully arranged. On February 15, the Citizens General Association allocated a fake ambulance to transport the goods, accompanied by the transportation committee, risking danger. Unexpectedly, the locks were broken and the doors were broken, and the scene was a mess. The remaining goods were temporarily packed and transported by car one after another and returned to each factory. Due to time constraints, they could not be transported completely. Later, after the National Army withdrew, there was no opportunity to transport them again, and it has been delayed until now, resulting in heavy losses. Yesterday, a letter was received from Mr. Wang Binyan, stating that at night, thugs armed with weapons attempted to rob the machines and other items deposited by the association. The resident group members resisted and thwarted their plan. Since they have been coveted, it is extremely difficult to prevent them. It is heard that police power will be restored in the near future. As soon as transportation is convenient, please write back to discuss ways to transport the goods, etc. The association believes that it is in the interests of each factory and should immediately plan for protection. It is specially scheduled to convene executive and supervisory committee members and members of the National Exhibition at the association's office at Jiumudi at 3:00 PM today (19th) to discuss proper measures to facilitate transportation.</p>

<h3>Subsidy Fees Issued for Silk Exports Yesterday</h3>
<p>Entrusted to the China and Four Other Banks</p>
<p>Customs Ordered to Stop Collecting Silk Export Tax</p>
<p>To rescue the silk and cocoon industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, after the government appointed special commissioners and established the Committee for the Reorganization of Obsolete Silks and Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the Committee for the Promotion of Obsolete Silks in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, they immediately engaged in registration. The Jianghai Customs in this city also received orders to stop collecting export taxes on raw silk and surcharges on the Silk Industry Public Bonds Fund from yesterday. At the same time, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces implemented the issuance of export subsidies for raw silk. The details of each item are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Announcement to Stop Collection</h3>
<p>Tang Hai'an, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Mei Lehe, Customs Commissioner, received orders from the Ministry of Finance to stop collecting the export tax on white silk, spun silk, yellow silk, douyan silk, and waste silk listed in Articles 180 to 184 of the Export Tariff, and the original special donation (i.e., the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds Fund Surcharge) from May 18. They immediately complied with the order and implemented it, and announced it to the public on the same day.</p>
<h3>Issuance of Subsidies</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Shen Huachen, a member of the Committee for the Reorganization of Obsolete Silks and Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, yesterday. According to him, for every dan of raw silk spun from obsolete silks and cocoons in the factories of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces that have been registered with the committee, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will grant a subsidy of 100 taels of silver when they are transported and sold overseas. The China, Communications, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Local four banks have now been entrusted to handle the matter. The procedures for issuing subsidy vouchers are based on the inspection bureau's public weight list and the raw silk export certificate issued by the Jianghai Customs to the export merchants, starting from the date when the Jianghai Customs stopped collecting silk export taxes as announced by the Ministry of Finance. However, products from outside the two provinces and silk, yellow silk, yellow cocoons, dougong silk, cocoon pillows for domestic use are not eligible for subsidies. The government has now allocated 2.2 million taels for subsidies.</p>
<h3>Public Notice to All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Committee for the Reorganization of Obsolete Silks and Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang announced yesterday that the procedures for registration have been notified in succession. The key points that should be noted are specially notified as follows: (1) The registration date for other places is limited to May 20 and will not be extended. (2) If the registered obsolete silks and cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang need to be transferred to another warehouse or transferred to another household, a written report must be submitted to the committee, indicating the number of packages, the name of the warehouse, and the warehouse receipt number for re-registration in the general registration book. (3) If the registered obsolete cocoons are to be shipped out of the warehouse and transported to a factory for silk reeling, a written report must be submitted to the committee in advance, indicating the warehouse receipt number of a certain warehouse and the number of packages to be shipped to which factory. (4) When the committee sends personnel to inspect the warehouses where the registered obsolete cocoons are stored, the method is to take out several packages from each batch of cocoons to weigh and calculate the weight, and to take a small sample of one pound from each batch of cocoons. Please provide convenience and assistance to the warehouse for handling. (5) All registered (A) obsolete silk and cocoons from other places, (B) obsolete silk from obsolete cocoons and cocoons in warehouses in this and other places must be transferred to the Shanghai Silk and Cocoon Warehouse for inspection. This is a special notice. I hope you will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>New Cocoons on the Market</h3>
<p>In Shengxian, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Yuyao, Huzhou, Hangzhou, Haining, and other places in Zhejiang Province, the new cocoons have already been put on the market, and the cocoon merchants are handling the purchases according to the announcements and regulations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The highest price for Dutch varieties is 25 yuan per dan, and the highest price for improved varieties is 35 yuan per dan. Due to weather damage, the number of new cocoons harvested is even less than in previous years, and the number of households raising silkworms has been greatly reduced, which has greatly affected the economy of the farmers. It is expected that the new cocoons in Jiaxing and Pinghu in Zhejiang Province will be put on the market within a few days. However, the new cocoons in Wuxi, Liyang, Changzhou, and other places in Jiangsu Province will have to wait until the end of this month.</p>
<p>Wuzhen Road Bridge and Mongolia Road Intersection</p>
<p>Reopening Today to Restore Traffic</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Zhabei and other places were used as battlefields, and barbed wire fences and sandbags were placed at the junctions of the Chinese and Foreign Concessions, cutting off traffic. After the signing of the armistice agreement, the Japanese army subsequently withdrew. The Japanese army in the fourth district of the Public Security Bureau south of the railway also withdrew a few days ago, and our police took over. The city's commerce has gradually recovered. In addition to the Hengfeng Road Bridge in the area, which has been unblocked earlier, the Wuzhen Road Bridge, Xinzhaji, and Mongolia Road intersection (as for the changes), have not yet been restored. The municipal authorities have requested the Municipal Council to find a way to open the above-mentioned main roads. According to Huang Ming, the captain of the brigade and director of the Shanghai North Office, who spoke to a reporter from the Guowen News Agency yesterday, except for the Xinzhaji Bridge, the Wuzhen Road Bridge and Mongolia Road intersection have been approved by the Municipal Council to be opened from tomorrow morning (8th) to restore traffic.</p>
<h3>Interview with Members of the Postal Workers Unions</h3>
<p>Report on the Truth about the Postal Foundation Consolidation Plan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers Union and the Employees Union submitted a plan to the Ministry of Communications to consolidate the postal foundation. To clarify the situation, reporters specially visited Qi Jiamou, a standing committee member of the Postal Workers Union, yesterday. The following is a record of the interview: (Reporter) Your association's plan has many items. What is the main purpose? (Answer) Our association believes that the post office has fallen into a state of deficit. Therefore, we want to seek a fundamental remedy. We have specially put forward a concrete plan. The main method is to merge the Savings and Remittance Bureau and implement special postal accounting to maintain the good Li postal system and consolidate the economic foundation. (Question) The Savings and Remittance Bureau has been separated for three years. Why do you insist on merging it now? (Answer) Before the Savings and Remittance Bureau was created, both our associations and the postal workers across the country first opposed it. In the years 18 and 19, we submitted documents to the Ministry of Communications requesting a merger. Even at the beginning of Minister Chen's appointment last year, we sent representatives to prepare documents requesting a merger. In the past, our association remained quiet and observed how the bureau was operating. To maintain the post office, we did not take active action. However, the separate establishment of the bureau has caused the post office to suffer losses. Therefore, our association should not delay any longer at this time and ask for a merger. In short, merging the Savings and Remittance Bureau is the only way to save the post office. The claim does not start from today. (Question) The merger of the Savings and Remittance Bureau is easily misunderstood as a personnel issue. How do you explain it? (Answer) Our association resolutely advocated the merger of the Savings and Remittance Bureau during the tenure of Wang Boqun, the former Minister of Communications. Our association's past movements have all been to safeguard national undertakings and the interests of the people, and to seek the integrity of power. There are absolutely no other issues. Just look at our association's bright history, and the outside world's misunderstandings will naturally be dispelled, etc.</p>
<p>General Labor Union</p>
<h3>Telegram to Request Adoption of Postal Workers' Suggestions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Labor Union sent a telegram to the Ministry of Transportation, stating: "To Minister of Transportation Chen Jun: It is our humble opinion that the Chinese postal system has achieved remarkable results and annual surpluses due to its well-structured system and meticulous management over the years. However, since the recovery of postal rights, the postal system has been subject to the control of political tides, losing its independence. Furthermore, with unqualified personnel in charge, national public utilities are being used to serve private interests. This has led to the establishment of superfluous organizations, shaking the foundation of the postal system, increasing expenditures, and wasting postal funds, resulting in the current situation of deficits. Tracing the root cause, this is a dangerous start. Now, they are attempting to compensate by increasing postal rates, which is like drinking poison to quench thirst, and can hardly be considered a good plan. In recent years, China's internal affairs have not been well managed, and there has been no construction. State-owned enterprises, apart from the postal system, such as railways, telecommunications, and aviation, have accumulated numerous malpractices and suffered huge losses. However, since the recovery of postal rights, even the last remaining achievement of the postal system has been ruined to this extent, inviting ridicule from foreign guests and jeopardizing the nation's lifeline, which is extremely disheartening. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Staff Union, based on their years of observation, have submitted a concrete plan to your ministry to consolidate the foundation of the postal system. The measures proposed, such as abolishing the Savings and Remittance General Bureau, ceasing aviation subsidies, ensuring the economic viability of the postal system, and using postal revenue to support the postal system, reflect deep thought, foresight, and a thorough understanding of the root causes, and are truly fundamental measures to consolidate the foundation of the postal system. We humbly request that your ministry promptly adopt and implement these measures, and revoke the order to increase postal rates, so as not to disappoint the postal workers' ardent desire to protect the postal system, and to live up to the earnest expectations of the people. We respectfully submit this telegram, and hope for your consideration and approval." Respectfully, the Shanghai General Labor Union.</p>
<p>Jiangwan Disaster Relief Association</p>
<h3>Dispatching Personnel to Investigate Impoverished Households</h3>
<p>Organizing a Relief Committee</p>
<p>The Jiangwan District Disaster Relief Association believes that providing immediate relief after the ceasefire is of utmost importance. In order to establish standards for providing relief, in addition to referring to the registered loss records of businesses, staff members Xu Liangyou and Zhang Shanyu have been dispatched to the villages to conduct on-site investigations of impoverished households, with a deadline of ten days for completion. Yesterday, Wang Yongzhi, the director of the association's investigation department, convened Xu, Zhang, and all staff members to discuss the procedures for starting the work. It is reported that they have decided to depart this morning. Furthermore, the association held its first meeting to establish a relief committee, with members including Yan Shaoqiu, Wang Yongzhi, Jiang Wenfang, Zhang Zhongsi, and Xu Liangzu. At the first meeting, Yan Shaoqiu was elected as chairman, Wang Yongzhi as general affairs officer, Jiang Wenfang as security officer, Zhang Zhongsi as statistician, and Xu Liangzu as disbursement officer. It was also decided that a general meeting would be held once a week.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the War Zone Refugee Relief Association</h3>
<p>Currently Processing Repatriation</p>
<p>Subsequent Suspension of Shelter</p>
<p>The Shanghai area, with its bustling commercial districts and dense population, has been reduced to ruins since the January 28th Incident this year. Residents and merchants have been displaced and suffered greatly. The number of victims is countless. Charitable and public welfare organizations in Shanghai immediately established a temporary war zone refugee relief association to provide rescue and shelter with utmost effort. It is reported that the number of shelters has increased to thirty-one, and there are four hospitals. More than 300,000 refugees have been rescued so far. Now that the ceasefire has been implemented, the association has issued a notice, which is recorded below: "It is hereby notified that the war in Shanghai has ceased. The temporary shelters and hospitals established by the association are now being closed down and refugees are being repatriated. All shelters will be absolutely suspended from accepting new refugees."</p>
<h3>News of French Mail Ship Fire Yesterday</h3>
<p>Fifty-One Chinese Sailors Rescued</p>
<p>Mail on Board Completely Burned</p>
<p>The French Mail Ship Company's new vessel, the Georges Philippar, caught fire in the Red Sea, causing damage to the entire ship and losses of 20 million yuan. Many passengers and crew members were killed or injured. Further news from yesterday is summarized below:</p>
<h3>Passengers Flee in Panic</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Aden on the 17th reported that passengers rescued from the French ship Georges Philippar described the circumstances of the incident, stating that the fire spread rapidly upon discovery and was impossible to extinguish. All chemical fire extinguishers and hoses on board were ineffective. The flames spread quickly through the upper-level painted walls and decorations. As the fire spread, the radio room managed to send out a distress signal before being destroyed. The alert received by distant ships was relayed by two British ships and a Russian oil tanker. When the crew awakened the passengers and urged them to evacuate quickly, the resulting chaos was indescribable. Because the bow of the ship was downwind, flames and thick smoke engulfed the stern. Many lifeboats were quickly destroyed, and passengers could not reach their assigned evacuation stations. Husbands and wives, parents and children, could not look after each other. However, there were many life preservers and rafts on board, and many passengers jumped into the calm sea and were rescued by other ships. Among those rescued, some suffered burns, two of whom were seriously injured and sent to the hospital for treatment after landing. Mr. and Mrs. Alford, the president of the Annam Court, were rescued, but their daughter and son-in-law are missing.</p>
<h3>Shih Chao-chi Not on Board</h3>
<p>A National News Agency dispatch from Paris on the 17th reported that the name of Shih Chao-chi, the former Chinese envoy to Britain, was listed on the passenger manifest of the French merchant ship Georges Philippar, which recently had an accident. However, Shih Chao-chi was not among the rescued passengers who arrived safely in Paris. After receiving this news, the Associated Press inquired about the truth in Shanghai. It was reported that the Aden report was likely inaccurate, as recent reports of Shih's whereabouts indicated that he was still traveling in Spain and Portugal and would not have been on the French ship traveling west. The French Mail Ship Company's headquarters in Paris announced today that the number of passengers was 483, bringing the total number of passengers and crew members to 740. The passenger embarkation locations were recorded as follows: Kobe (4), Shanghai (135), Saigon (265), with the remainder boarding in Singapore. However, this record is only a preliminary report of the Georges Philippar accident and should not be considered exhaustive. Furthermore, passengers rescued after the Georges Philippar accident have safely arrived in Aden on two British ships. Approximately 80 to 100 people are feared to have been burned to death on board.</p>
<h3>Survival of Chinese Sailors</h3>
<p>The vessel employed seventy Chinese sailors. When the ship caught fire, each of them struggled to grab life jackets and small boats to escape. Some were unable to escape and were burned to death in the fire, while others fell into the sea and were bitten by sharks and drowned. Yesterday, news from Athens reported that fifty-one of the Chinese sailors had been rescued, while nineteen were still missing. Most of them either died in the fire or drowned.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Passenger Casualties</h3>
<p>Yesterday, news from Athens reported that the Georges Philippar accident occurred on the afternoon of the 15th, starting with an explosion in the engine room. Because the entire ship was powered by electricity, a massive jolt was followed by simultaneous fires everywhere. The bow and stern of the ship were particularly intense. Although the ship was equipped with chemical fire extinguishers, attempts to extinguish the fire were completely ineffective. The captain immediately ordered the radio room to send out a distress signal, but the fire had already reached the radio room before the message could be completed and it was quickly destroyed. Passengers fled in panic, some grabbing lifeboats, some grabbing life jackets, and some jumping into the sea. Some of those rescued had been injured by fish bites. It has now been confirmed that dozens of people have died, and the captain and Athens branch are still being instructed to investigate further.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Relatives Inquire</h3>
<p>Yesterday, many relatives of passengers who boarded the ship on April 23rd to travel to France went to the French company in Shanghai to inquire about the safety of the passengers after the ship accident and whether any Chinese passengers from Shanghai had died. The company, unable to obtain detailed information, promised to send telegrams to inquire about the whereabouts of each individual.</p>
<h3>Mr. Muirhead Rescued</h3>
<p>Reuters, 17th</p>
<p>London reports that Mr. Muirhead, the British deputy inspector of the Hankou River Patrol, and his wife were passengers on the ill-fated French ship Georges Philippar. He has telegraphed his brother, saying that he and his wife were rescued by a Russian ship and are safe and sound.</p>
<h3>Ship to Remain a Shell</h3>
<p>The intensity of the fire on the ship is unprecedented. Since the fire started on the afternoon of the 15th, it has been burning for three days, and the fires in each cabin have not yet subsided. The cabins, furnishings, equipment, and cargo have been completely destroyed and cannot be extinguished. The Athens branch is busy rescuing passengers and can only allow the fire to continue burning. A large batch of mail from Shanghai and other places was reportedly unable to be retrieved and was completely burned.</p>
<h3>Substantial Fire Insurance</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 17th - According to Lloyd's Company today, the French ship Philippar was insured for £1.25 million, with British insurance companies underwriting half of the amount.</p>
<h3>French Mail Company Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 17th (Night) - The French Mail Ship Company issued a statement strongly denying rumors that the Georges Philippar ship accident was due to a communist conspiracy to sink the Suez Canal and obstruct the transport of European munitions to Japan. They stated that all evidence indicates that the fire was caused by an electrical fault in the first-class cabin and that there is no evidence of a communist conspiracy.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Valentin Talks About the Fire</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Aden, 18th - Mrs. Valentin, the wife of the Chief Engineer of the Tianjin Kailan Mining Company, who was also on the French mail ship Georges Philippar returning to Europe, arrived safely here today after being rescued. She stated that it is certain that many passengers were buried in the fire because the fire spread very quickly, preventing many passengers from escaping from the cabins. Although the crew immediately launched lifeboats after discovering the fire, many people were already trapped inside the fire. The fire appeared to have started inside the paneling beneath the floor of the empty cabins. She first noticed an anomaly in the ceiling lights and wanted to press the call button for a waiter, but the wall switch fell off at her touch, and she felt that the electrical wire was very hot and would burn her hand. She was terrified and ran to the deck. Mrs. Valentin's words indicate that the fire on the ship was due to an electrical fault in the empty cabins. It is also reported that over a hundred people have perished in the fire.</p>

<h3>Jiangjing Steamer Returns to Port Due to Engine Damage</h3>
<p>Passengers and Cargo Safe</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangjing steamer departed from Shanghai yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, fully loaded with passengers and cargo, bound for Hankou. Around 10:00 AM, while passing near the Wenzaobang Railway Wharf, the engine steam pipe suddenly broke, causing the rudder to malfunction. The ship then anchored at that location and is currently being prepared to return to Shanghai for repairs. Fortunately, the company's Taishun steamer, arriving in Shanghai from Qingdao, approached the area. The Jiangjing's first mate immediately signaled, and after seeing the signal, the Taishun approached the ship. The shipowner then sent the first mate on the Taishun steamer to Shanghai to report to the head office. The head office then dispatched two tugboats, the Huide and Defeng, to Wenzaobang to tow the Jiangjing back to Shanghai. Around 6:00 PM, the ship was towed to Jinliyuan Wharf, and passengers disembarked one after another to transfer to other ships to continue their journey. The shipowner reported the damage to the head office, and repairs will be carried out within the next few days.</p>
<p>Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<h3>Planning Rural Credit Cooperatives</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to help unemployed citizens in the city find ways to make a living, has established fifteen poverty relief loan offices since 1929. Last year, the amount loaned reached over 130,000 yuan, benefiting more than 10,000 poor people, with only eight yuan in bad debts. The results have been effective. After the war this year, the Jiangwan and Wusong districts suffered significantly, and the rural economy is facing even greater difficulties. In order to seek active relief, in addition to finding ways to restore the loan offices in each district, the bureau is planning rural credit cooperatives to facilitate the flow of the rural economy. Detailed regulations have been established for subsidies for cooperative expenses. A draft implementation plan for promoting rural credit cooperatives has been prepared and is being submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>

<h3>Another Opposition to Opium Monopoly</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation Declaration</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation's Declaration Against Opium Monopoly states: "To the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association and all sectors of the nation: The harm of opium is known throughout the world, and all countries consider it a strict prohibition. However, our country's anti-smoking authorities and civil and military officials in various provinces are addicted to drugs, seeking only profit, abandoning smoking bans, and advocating public sales. Last year, the Anti-Smoking Investigation Bureau was in disarray for a time, but public opinion would not allow it, and opposition arose. The authorities then realized that public opinion could not be easily defied, and the Executive Yuan explicitly ordered its abolition. However, they disregarded the lessons of repeating past mistakes and sought to revive the dead ashes. They established a narcotic drugs management agency immediately afterward, but again suffered setbacks and failed to implement it. They accumulated hatred and malice, became ashamed and angry, and hoped to carry out a large-scale operation to satisfy their desires. Therefore, they recruited petty people, adopted evil schemes, and instructed various provinces to conduct public sales, causing the masses to be distracted and exhausted. The central anti-smoking authorities could both reap the benefits and shift the responsibility, and their cunning was unsurpassed. Currently, provinces across the country are implementing public sales in a rush, which has spread uncontrollably. It is said that only Zhejiang and Shandong provinces have not implemented it, while the rest are filled with opium addicts and enveloped in a poisonous fog. The sight is heartbreaking. What kind of world is this? At a time when foreign aggression has not ceased and the disaster of national extinction is imminent, the central government is busy defending against aggression and saving the nation, yet it has the audacity to implement this policy of poisoning the country and speeding up its demise. We overseas Chinese have yearned for good governance for twenty years. Although the Republic of China has not been entirely satisfactory, the hope that our motherland will one day strive for good governance and become strong has always lingered in our hearts without the slightest decrease. Now, the so-called National Government, which claims to be based on public opinion, is actually condoning various provinces and the central anti-smoking authorities in forcibly implementing the opium monopoly policy, which will destroy the nation and exterminate the race. This cannot but cause overseas compatriots to lose hope, break their hearts, and weep with despair, lamenting that there is ultimately no hope for the motherland. Opium monopoly is an evil policy of mercantile imperialism to poison the people of the colonies. We overseas Chinese, due to our commercial relations overseas, are entrusted to the rule of foreign powers and have personally tasted the bitterness of the colonial government's policy of drug promotion. The suffering is deeply ingrained in our minds. Our motherland's government, in order to appease the overseas Chinese, has promised to provide relief. However, not only has it gone back on its word, but it has also lost its mind and picked up the harsh policies of others. What others impose on colonies, we are now imposing on our own people, bringing shame for a hundred years, ridicule for ten thousand generations, and the disaster of extermination is imminent. Therefore, we dare to wipe away our tears and plead with all sectors of society to consider that the Chinese nation, which has survived and thrived for more than four thousand years, will from now on be dragged into the mire, enslaved, wailing in agony, and perishing together. We urge everyone to rise up and fight against the evil forces, one after another, even unto death, to punish all corrupt officials who promote drugs and extort wealth, and to kill all shameless traitors who advocate public sales, in order to create a precedent for the people's self-determination and save the nation from destruction. The Federation is willing to lead millions of overseas compatriots and vow to be the rearguard. We respectfully submit this declaration."</p>
<p>Seamen's Union Telegram Request</p>
<h3>Recovery of Yangtze River Navigation Markers</h3>
<p>Relates to National Defense, Do Not Delay and Mislead Again</p>
<p>The Reorganization Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters: "To the esteemed Central Executive Committee: It is our understanding that the Yangtze River navigation markers have been managed by the customs for decades without improvement. Hundreds of thousands of taels of tax are collected annually, but the convenience of shipping is not taken into consideration. The dredging of waterways, measurement of flow rates, indication of sandbars, hydrographic surveys, and installation of appropriate markers are all ignored. As a result, ships sailing in this area often run aground or run into sandbars. On May 6 of this year, the Shipping Weekly published an article expressing this concern in detail. Yangtze River merchant ships pay a large amount of ship tax every year, but the navigation markers in the inland ports are not maintained, making the merchant ships have the obligation to pay taxes but no benefit from navigation. Moreover, the Yangtze River is our country's inland river, but the navigation markers are managed by foreigners, who know the terrain like the back of their hand. This affects national defense and is no trivial matter. What is even more painful is that the customs provide convenience to foreigners but create difficulties for our country's ships. Seamen have personally experienced this and know it all too well. We read in the National Government's announcement of the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Transportation that navigation markers are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, and we thought that they could be removed from customs management. However, the Ministry of Transportation has been delaying and misleading itself, allowing power to fall into the hands of others and become a guest in its own land, exceeding its authority, and the shipowners have been enduring it silently because they have no way to appeal. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has declared to the outside world that it will recover inland river navigation rights in 1932. Now is the time to recover the management of these navigation markers and return them to the competent department in order to maintain the law and be the vanguard of practicing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' declaration. We have read in the newspapers that the Ministry of Transportation has requested the Executive Yuan to approve the recovery of management. We dare to present our concerns and earnestly request that the esteemed Committee forward this to the National Government and order the Executive Yuan to approve the proposed plan and order the Ministry of Finance to instruct the customs to quickly recover the management of these markers. This will not only greatly benefit the future of the shipping industry but also strengthen national defense. We respectfully submit this telegram and request your consideration." Respectfully, the Reorganization Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union.</p>

<h3>Publication of Historical Diplomatic Materials from the Late Qing Dynasty</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Yanwang Taofu, while serving in the central government during the late Qing Dynasty, compiled a book titled "Historical Diplomatic Materials from the Late Qing Dynasty." His son, Xi Yin, has augmented and compiled it into a collection of 240 volumes. It also includes separate sections of indices and chronicles of important events during the Western Tour. It extensively collects documents and telegrams related to the formation of unequal treaties, war, peace negotiations, trade, and boundary demarcation during the Guangxu and Xuantong reigns, as well as meeting minutes from the Zongli Yamen (foreign affairs office) and foreign envoys.

It is reported that since its publication, domestic provinces such as Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang, as well as foreign countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Japan, have all subscribed to it. British and French individuals are even discussing translating the index into Western languages to broaden its circulation. Currently, with diplomacy being urgent, patriotic individuals overseas who intend to offer advice should quickly purchase a copy, as it will undoubtedly benefit national affairs.</p>
<h3>Taihe Comprador Fined 8,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Shen Chengfu, the comprador of the British firm Taihe Foreign Company, absconded from his position last August due to a substantial deficit in the company's funds. The company's manager, a Westerner, hired a lawyer to sue him in the First Special District Local Court. Repeated trials have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning was the date for the verdict in the case. Shen duly arrived in court as summoned. Judge Feng Shide ascended the bench and announced the main text of the judgment, stating that Shen Chengfu, knowing he had no deposits and without obtaining permission for overdrafts, issued checks, resulting in a fine of 8,000 yuan. If the fine is not fully paid through enforcement, the equivalent amount will be converted into imprisonment based on the ratio of the total fine to the number of days in a year. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be offset at a rate of three yuan per day. The charges of breach of trust and embezzlement were found not guilty. The attached civil suit will be transferred to the civil court. After the pronouncement, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang requested that the defendant remain under the original bail during the appeal period, which the court approved.</p>
<h3>Nephew Sues Maternal Uncles</h3>
<p>Embezzlement of Inheritance</p>
<p>Ten Shares Worth 300,000 Gold</p>
<p>Another Act in the Sheng Family Inheritance Dispute</p>
<p>After Sheng Zecheng and others divided the estate of their deceased mother, Madame Zhuang, their nephew, Lin Fengwen, not having received any share, sued his maternal uncles in the First Special District Local Court for embezzlement. Before one wave subsides, another rises. Now, he has been jointly sued by Shao Yunpeng, Yunqi, Yunlin, Yunxiang, Yunjun, and Yunzhi, the sons and daughter of his fourth aunt, Zhihui. Zhihui was the fourth daughter of Sheng Xuanhuai, married to a Mr. Shao from Yuyao. When Zhuang Tai Furen, the secondary wife of the late Vice-Minister, passed away in the sixteenth year, Zhihui personally attended to the funeral arrangements. Initially, there was no mention of Madame Tai Furen having a will for dividing the estate. Zhihui also passed away in the eighteenth year. Recently, during the opening of the trial in Lin Fengwen's lawsuit against Sheng Zecheng and others for embezzlement, the defendants stated that Madame Zhuang had left a will stating that Zhihui should receive 10,000 yuan, etc. The Shao sons only then learned of the existence of their maternal grandmother's will. Although their mother had also passed away, they were entitled to inherit this right according to the law. Considering that Madame Zhuang, during her lifetime, loved her children equally, the distribution of property should have been equal. The distribution amounts stipulated in the will showed obvious discrepancies. Therefore, the Shao brothers concluded that the will could not have originated from Madame Zhuang. As a result, the Shao brothers hired a lawyer to send letters to their maternal uncles Sheng Zecheng, Zechen, Pingchen, and their cousins Sheng Yuchang, Yuyou, and their aunts Sheng Guan Ying, Fang Yi, Ai Yi, Jing Yi, etc., questioning them. Failing to receive a satisfactory response, they followed in Lin Fengwen's footsteps and filed a criminal self-suit against their uncles and cousins, claiming that Madame Zhuang had a will for 3 million yuan, divided into ten shares, of which they should have jointly received 300,000 yuan. Because the defendants forged the will, the inheritance they were entitled to was entirely embezzled, and they requested a thorough investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi of the First Special Court presided over the trial. The six plaintiffs designated Shao Yunpeng to state the purpose of the lawsuit. He claimed that the defendants had never informed them of the will or sent someone to summon Shao Xunmei, their adopted brother, after the property was divided, saying they would give each of them 10,000 yuan, but the talks were inconclusive. Sheng Zecheng, speaking for the defendants, stated that the will was discovered on October 31st of last year, so the distribution for each branch was handled according to the will thereafter. The plaintiffs' mother was supposed to receive 10,000 yuan, which was sent but rejected because they considered it too little. Judge Wu stated that because the parties were close relatives, it was inappropriate to be involved in litigation, and advised both parties to mediate outside the court. The case was adjourned to June 1st for further review.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhenxiang Shot Dead in Revenge Attack</h3>
<p>Formerly Involved in Flower Societies</p>
<p>Killed by Four Gunshots</p>
<p>Wang Zhenxiang (nickname "Little Devil Ah Liu"), a 33-year-old native of Shaoxing, residing at No. 10 Yukang Lane, Pi Shao Nai Road, French Concession, was formerly involved in flower societies. He was quite famous among the French Concession's gangsters and had considerable savings, owning a personal car. Around 12:45 AM this morning, Wang left his home after finishing a mahjong game with friends. Unexpectedly, four or five thugs, all dressed in blue cloth shirts and trousers, ambushed him in the alley. Seeing Wang step out of the alley entrance, the thugs immediately opened fire with pistols, firing about six or seven shots, hitting Wang four times: once in the side of his face, once in the abdomen, once in the left waist, and once in the left thigh. Wang fell to the ground in a pool of blood and died instantly. His wife rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, but the assailants had already fled without a trace. She immediately reported to the Songshan Road police station, who dispatched detectives to the scene. They could only transport the body to Renji Hospital for an examination before transferring it to Tongren Fu Yuan Tang for storage. The deceased was wearing a dark blue silk jacket, with a Sheng textile striped shirt and trousers underneath, black satin shoes, and gray silk socks.

<h3>Notorious Bandit Fu Peisheng Cannot Escape the Law</h3>
<p>Committed Numerous Crimes and Evildoings</p>
<p>To be Brought to Court Soon for Trial</p>
<p>The notorious bandit Fu Peisheng (nickname "Hua Mei Peisheng") usually robbed residents in the Gaoqiao area of Pudong. He had many accomplices. In the winter of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, he was arrested for leading a gang to rob Huang Shenqing's rice shop in Xujiaqiao, east of Gaoqiao, and was sentenced to three years in prison. After his release, he did not repent and continued to rob and extort in the countryside. Between the summer and autumn of last year, armed robberies in various towns and villages near Gaoqiao were almost nightly, causing the people to live in fear. These were all committed by the notorious bandit. Military police and various agencies sent out detectives to apprehend him. Eventually, with the help of Zhang Jinmao, a local villager, detectives captured four of Fu's gang members: Ni Erlang, Zhu Jinhua, Ge Sansan, and Zhu Jinfa. They were detained and interrogated by the headquarters. The bandits confessed directly that they obeyed the bandit leader Chuan Peisheng, carried out armed robberies at Xiaoshiqiao, Binwandou, and other places, robbing more than ten households of their property, and using the stolen money without denying it. The gang of bandits was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, and Fu Peisheng and others were wanted by law. Afterwards, Fu Peisheng learned that the gang of bandits were caught by Zhang Jinmao, he hated him to the core. On the night of June 11th of last year, Fu Peisheng, together with the wanted Wu Chang Gui, Monk, and his concubine Guo Mao Lang, lured Zhang Jinmao to Jiebang in Gaoqiao Town. Fu Peisheng shot Jinmao in the back of the head, killing him instantly. Fu and others then used three large stones to tie Jinmao's body and sink it in the Jiebang River to destroy the body and cover up the traces. The next morning, the body floated up and was retrieved by local bailiffs, who reported it to the local court. Prosecutors were dispatched to the village to examine the body and provide a coffin for burial, while the criminal bandit Fu Peisheng and others were sought after. After killing Jinmao, Fu Peisheng and his concubine Guo Mao Lang fled to other places and only returned to Shanghai in the middle of last month. Zhang Quanzhou, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrested Fu Peisheng and Guo Mao Lang and sent them to the Third Section. Guo Mao Lang confessed that her concubine Fu Peisheng killed Zhang Jinmao, sank the body in the river, and fled to other places. The pistol was borrowed from his fellow party member Lu Ronglin. They are now being held in the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Upon hearing the news, the Shanghai Local Court has sent a letter to transfer them for trial.</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the article on page 3 of your newspaper on the 16th of this month, concerning the case of Dr. Tang Jingqing from Nanshi being intimidated, it mentions Wang Zuzhen, 25 years old, from Zhenhai, currently working as an accountant at the Salt Affairs Audit Office, who claims to be the main culprit in this case. After investigation, there is no such person as Wang Zuzhen working in our office as an accountant. This is clearly fabricated. We hereby request that you correct it immediately. Sincerely, the Salt Affairs Audit General Office of the Ministry of Finance, Shanghai Newspaper Office, May 18th, No. 987.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news in the "Local News" section on page 9 of issue No. 3 of your newspaper on May 6th ("Mutual Admiration in Hospital, Widow Lives Together"), it states that Yang Xianbang, the former head of surveying for the Gongxun Bureau, is currently serving as a road consultant in the Henan Security Office, etc. After investigation, Yang Xianbang is not an advisor in several locations, and there is no such person as Yang Xianbang among the employees. We hereby request that you investigate and correct this matter. Sincerely, the Henan Security Office to the Shanghai Newspaper Office, May 12th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>According to Mr. Yang Jingcun, the person concerned, today's newspapers published a news item about Kong Chenshi Kong Shujun suing me in court for inflicting harm. After reading it, I was deeply surprised. Although this case has been summoned for questioning once, it was postponed due to my late arrival and has not yet been publicly tried. However, the newspapers were able to describe the opposing party's statement in detail, as if they were familiar with it. This clearly shows that the opposing party intentionally spread propaganda in an attempt to damage my reputation. I hereby request that you issue a statement to the newspapers on my behalf, stating that Kong Shujun, who is actually Miaodi Laoqi, has been engaged in prostitution and has no marital relationship with me. The statements made in her complaint are purely fabricated and do not correspond to the facts. Please correct this matter promptly to avoid confusing the public. Sincerely, Lawyer He Shimei to the Chief Editor of the Shanghai Newspaper Office.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the article "University Students Mistaken as Koreans" that our agency sent to your newspaper on the 14th of this month, the French Concession police station on Songshan Road claims that this is not factual. We hereby request that you correct this matter urgently. Sincerely, the National News Agency to the Chief Editor of the Shanghai Newspaper. May 18th.</p>

<h3>Gold and Silver Prices Rebound Four Taels</h3>
<p>The market was extremely calm yesterday. The gold price situation was quite peaceful. The total amount of gold changing hands throughout the day was only four taels. Looking back, it has broken through 700 taels again, with an overall increase of around four taels. Prices rose from the beginning, although large bars continued to increase, the silver price actually fell back. In the future, there may be slight ups and downs, but as the foreign exchange situation seems tense, the gold price is likely to be mediocre, with only a slight drop, due to Wednesday being a non-trading day. Transactions from all sides were also scarce, but the market sentiment was stable. The daily situation is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Breaking Through the 700 Tael Mark</h3>
<p>The July opening price rose four and a half taels to 702.5 taels. The British silver price continued to rise by one-eighth, while the American silver price fell by one-quarter.

At this time, retail investors sold off, with Sun selling at 1.23 qian, and the British gold opening price had narrowed by one grade, with the U.S. dollar at 375, resulting in 04.5 qian.

Sanjing sold August silver for 875, so the gold price fell sharply by four taels. At 11:00, it was 700 taels and 0.05 qian. After that, Yifeng Yongfu Taiheng Fuyu bought, so it was pulled up by more than two taels to 03.2 qian at 11:45.

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds: Initial Decline Followed by Rise</h3>

<p>Yesterday (the 18th), the market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed limited spot trading, with only 44,000 yuan changing hands throughout the day.

The reorganization bonds, both the serialized bonds and those of the "sixth" series, remained without a market. Regarding the price trends of various bonds, the market was initially weak due to a cautious market sentiment and more selling than buying, resulting in price declines of about half a yuan. Although the second session was slightly firmer, the fluctuations were still minor, and the trend remained sluggish. The situation improved in the afternoon market, with retail investors taking advantage of the low prices to buy in, and buying sentiment becoming stronger than selling. As a result, prices rebounded across the board, but the trend remained moderate. Overall, there were mixed gains and losses compared to the previous day, with spot and futures contracts for customs duties, reorganization, and troop reduction continuing to decline, while the remaining contracts rose by about 5 to 6 cents compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3>No Major Changes in New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>Report from American-Eastern Silver Company</p>
<p>Market conditions on Tuesday saw a shift towards apathy. Prices fluctuated at the opening, but selling pressure later eased, leading to gains in various securities. By the close, prices had fallen again. There were no special economic news items yesterday, except for a statement by Congressman Garner, who predicted that the U.S. Congress would have a lengthy session this summer. The eventual decline in prices may have been due to this. Industrial stocks were the firmest on Tuesday, with closing prices still up a few points from the previous day. Leading stocks in this sector showed progress. Railroad and utility stocks experienced similar pressure, resulting in comparable results. Public bonds followed the stock market's movements. According to the Dow Jones report, the average price of 40 public bonds was 72.62, down 0.12 points. The Dow Jones daily index is attached below:</p>
<p>May 16 May 17 Change</p>
<p>30 Industrials 53.96 54.04 Up 0.08 20 Railroads 18.25 18.05 Down 0.20 20 Utilities 22.92 22.71 Down 0.21</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Weak Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is exceptionally sluggish with nothing exciting to report. Some are bearish due to the rapid changes in the situation in Guangdong and the unrest in Japan not being fully resolved. With these various factors, the yarn market is in a state of siege on all sides, so how can there be any vitality? Therefore, most people are adopting a selling-off strategy. Fortunately, the bottom has already been reached. Even if major unfavorable news comes out, the degree of market decline is still shallow. However, actual sales have also become sluggish, and it is difficult for the market to turn around.</p>
<h3>Man-Mark Falls by One or Two</h3>
<p>The opening of the Man-Mark market in the previous session was characterized by a decline in American cotton and a poor atmosphere in the market. The trading floor was relatively weak, but transactions were still lacking. Prices for each month fell by 1 or 2 cents. In the afternoon, some profit-takers covered their positions, causing prices to rise slightly by 1 or 2 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 5,450 bales. The following sales were recorded: Tongfu sold 150 bales, Gengfeng 1,450 bales, Shenji 250 bales, Yiyu 250 bales, and Yongda 150 bales. The following purchases were recorded: Jifeng bought 450 bales, Yukang 100 bales, Changji 250 bales, and Yuantai 400 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Spot Cotton Continues to be Dull</h3>
<p>Spot cotton sales remain sluggish. Total purchases by various groups throughout the day amounted to 350 bales, and futures contracts totaled 300 bales. Inbound deliveries from various groups included 124 bales from the mainland, 20 bales from Ningbo, 10 bales from Changsha, 5 bales from Shantou, 20 bales from Zhenjiang, 72 bales from Yunnan, 15 bales from the North Group, and 300 bales of futures from Xuzhou. Deliveries among peers totaled 82 bales. Prices fell by 2.5 cents, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market: Decline Followed by Slight Rebound</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially declined and then rebounded slightly, but the trend remains weak. American cotton has fallen again, and the Indian religious unrest has intensified, with riots now extending to the cotton mill areas. Twenty mills have temporarily suspended operations, leading some to anticipate a decline in Indian cotton prices. However, some outsiders believe that local inventories are too low, and sentiment is bullish. However, the overall state of the global cotton industry remains weak and depressed, it is said.</p>
<h3>Zheng-Mark Phenomenon Lacking Vigor</h3>
<p>The opening of the Zheng-Mark market in the previous session was characterized by a decline in American cotton and weak market sentiment. There was a lack of buyers, and prices for each month fell by 4 or 5 cents. In the afternoon, some profit-takers covered their positions, causing prices to rise slightly by 1 or 2 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 11,500 dan. The following sales were recorded: Changhe sold 1,100 dan, Yuanda 200 dan, Yicheng 300 dan, Changfeng 900 dan, and Tongxing 900 dan. The following purchases were recorded: Dachang bought 600 dan, Tongxing 300 dan, Yifeng 200 dan, Yongda 500 dan, Yida 300 dan, Renfeng 400 dan, and Ruida 400 dan. The closing prices for Zheng-Mark are listed below:</p>

<h3>Spot Cotton Mills Not Open for Business</h3>
<p>Transactions of spot cotton remain few, with no substantial volume at any of the mills, due to the excessive absorption of foreign cotton. Prices offered are as follows:</p>
<p>Shandong American Cotton 54.50 Xie Feng Mill received 279 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the mill.</p>
<h3>Good Conditions for American Cotton Production</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices declined due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, good cotton production conditions, and reduced buyer interest. Futures prices fell by 18 to 20 points, and spot prices fell by 20 points. British cotton futures rose by 4 points, and spot prices rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 17th):</p>

<p>Eighteen Taels Lower Than Last Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, the new black tea from Wenzhou arriving from the LUZHUANG (Road Estate) was opened by Jardine Matheson at a starting price of 31 taels, 2 mace, and 5 fen, 18 taels lower than last year. Qimen black tea was also priced at 31 taels, 2 mace, and 5 fen, 18 taels lower than last year, but no deals have been made. The continued rise of foreign silver prices has increased interest from British tea merchants, leading to a more bullish market. However, there were no significant transactions for both LUZHUANG (Road Estate) and TUZHUANG (Native Estate) Jane-Mei green teas. The price of LUZHUANG (Road Estate) Suei-An tea fell by more than 10 taels, creating an unfavorable situation, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Extracted-Core Tea Has Begun Production</h3>
<p>Wuyuan green tea, with its excellent quality and taste, is the highest-grade green tea among foreign estate teas produced in China. With a wide variety of types, the most prized is Jane-Mei. In recent years, various tea houses, in order to gain recognition for Chinese tea worldwide, have invented a type of Extracted-Core Jane-Mei. Both the selection of materials and the production method are extremely refined. Last year, foreign merchants offered up to 350 taels for the Extracted-Core tea from Dongxiang, a market price rarely seen since tea production began in Wuyi County. As a result, Wuyi tea's reputation shone brightly in Europe and America. This year, the tea houses along the eastern route are striving for even greater perfection and are paying special attention to the Extracted-Core tea. Before the new tea season even started, they sent personnel to famous tea-producing areas to search for green buds and tender tips, offering prices ranging from one yuan to one yuan and three or four jiao per catty, making the tea cost over 400 yuan. The price of the tea plants in the mountains is even higher than that of Qimen tea. The Jinzhu Jitai Tea House in northern Wuyi began selecting and producing Extracted-Core tea the day before yesterday (the 9th). The tea's tenderness, color, aroma, and taste are all present. The tea is called "Fragrant Herb" and should be ready to be packed in boxes in about ten days. It is predicted that when this batch of Extracted-Core tea arrives in Shanghai, it will surely impress foreign merchants deeply.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea Market Price Declines</h3>
<p>Qimen Fuqiu black tea could normally be completely harvested by now, but since the tea season began, it has not rained for several days, and it has often been cold. As a result, it is difficult to call tea production prosperous, and tea houses are rarely buying. Although the two- or three-character teas are currently being shipped, the tea houses are hoping for sunny weather in the coming days to improve tea production so they can buy more. However, the sun has not appeared for the past two days, and there has been heavy rain. The tea produced is coarse, loose, and bulky. Furthermore, the tea houses have received telegrams from Shanghai stating that the financial situation is still tight and that the foreign tea market has not improved, advising them to be cautious and buy less. Upon receiving this news and struggling with a lack of cash, the tea houses have stopped weighing and buying tea, causing the mountain price to fall by 30 yuan compared to the previous few days. The market has suddenly become sluggish, with supply exceeding demand. Currently, the first-character tribute teas from various tea houses are being shipped one after another. The first-character large batches should be stacked up and ready for transport within a few days. Approximately ten days later, a large quantity of new tea should be on the market.</p>
<h3>Pessimistic Outlook for Silkworm Season in Pinghu</h3>
<p>Recently, the development of silkworms has been hindered by cold weather in various villages and towns in Pinghu and Dayi. The degree of hindrance varies from place to place. Early batches have already completed their major molt and started eating leaves, while later batches are still in their second molt. The poor weather is affecting the molting season. This year's silkworm production has already declined compared to the past due to the impact of the Shanghai war. Furthermore, economic difficulties have led to a shortage of money to buy leaves. As a result, many are abandoning their silkworms. There is an oversupply of mulberry leaves, and no one is interested in buying them. Therefore, people are going to the villages to peddle them. The price of leaves is around one yuan. The poor harvest of silkworms this year is already a proven fact and will have a significant impact on commerce. It is hoped that the authorities will find a way to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Low Price Ceiling for New Cocoons in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>New cocoons in Hangzhou have already entered the market. Large cocoon firms have set a price ceiling for today (the 18th)</p>
<p>Because of the relationship, the story suppresses, hearing the high goods limit 30 yuan, so the general sales cocoon villagers, Mo does not mourn the shape in color, saying that the leaf is still not the grain.</p>
<h3>No Improvement in Foreign Estate Silk Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign estate silk market in Shanghai showed no improvement. Foreign silk telegrams remained unfavorable, and American and European estates were thinking of accumulating cheap goods. However, Chinese silk merchants, due to substantial losses, were waiting and not selling, creating a stalemate in the market. Factory white, yellow, and gray silks remained stagnant due to low prices. The future of the silk market continues to look bleak.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Tightens and Then Relaxes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, several rice trading groups in southern Shanghai received ships numbered 34. River port inventories were low. Due to the clearing weather, people settled their expectations, and retail sales in cities and villages increased. The prices of Changzhou, Wuxi, northern japonica, and Suzhou and Tongzhou rice arriving in the market remained unchanged. The inventory of early and late rice was slightly higher, but sales were slow, and the market price remained stable but sluggish. High-quality Yanglu rice was scarce, and the market remained stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, several rice trading groups along the Suzhou Creek in northern Shanghai received ships numbered 56. The market in the city and along the waterway was initially active but then weakened. Transactions for Changzhou and Wuxi white japonica and Kunshan and Jiangyin rice were sluggish, with prices falling by about 1 jiao. High-quality green-tip, Shibu, and Songjiang rice remained relatively stable. The price of customs-controlled rice fell by 2 jiao. There were no gains or losses for Yanglu and glutinous rice.</p>
<h3>Min-Style Rice Sees Exceptional Price Increase</h3>
<p>New Shipment of Approximately 100,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrives</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was initially quite bullish, with strong demand for inland rice in this district. Subsequently, the Changjiang trading group suspended its purchases, and a new shipment of approximately 100,000 bags arrived. Furthermore, foreign firms were actively selling. Anli Foreign Firm had 3,000 tons of Saigon No. 1 rice to be weighed in July, with prices the same as yesterday, but requiring a 10% deposit in advance. As a result, 1,100 tons were sold, with long-grain rice priced at 5 taels, 4 mace, and 5 fen, and round-grain rice priced at 5 taels, 5 mace, and 5 fen. Huilong School opened for 200 tons, priced at 4 taels, 9 mace, and 7.5 fen. Therefore, the spot market was slightly weak. However, Min-style rice has not been continuously ordered for a long time, and the arrival of goods is also limited. There is a limited inventory, so the price trend is exceptionally bullish. The rice grains are relatively wide and can be mixed into Broken Rice, so it is welcomed by small rice shops in this district. Yesterday, 300 bags were sold, with prices reaching 11 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen and 10 yuan, an increase of 1 jiao and 5 fen compared to the previous day. Prices for other types of rice remained flat. Approximately 6,000 bags of Little Jiao rice were sold, priced at 10 yuan and 6 jiao to 10 yuan and 5 jiao, and 300 bags of old rice were priced at 10 yuan, 2 jiao, and 8 fen. Additionally, 500 bags of brown rice were priced at 9 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen, and 500 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were priced at 11 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Speculators Wait and See, Flour Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a slight decline in prices. This was due to the arrival of foreign wheat in Shanghai and the lack of substantial demand from large groups. Speculators were also waiting and seeing, so market sentiment was not optimistic. Although news of the large quantity of foreign wheat was reported, prices in the market fell. There was scattered interest yesterday, but the deadlines for May orders have arrived. Re-sales are inevitable, making it difficult for the market to rebound. Yesterday, the price of military ship flour for this month was 2 taels and 2 fen, down 5 li compared to the previous day. The price of Lao Che Pai flour was 2 taels, 3 fen, and 7 li, also down 2.5 li, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Taiyuan Icing Sugar Opens with 2 Mace Decline</h3>
<p>New Arrival of 500 Bags of Zhang Diao Green Sugar</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trading floor of the sugar market association saw little trading, and the overall market appeared bleak. Dutch sugar No. 24 grade sand white high-quality goods were quoted at 13 taels, 3 mace, ordinary goods at 13 taels, 2 mace, and Hong Kong goods at 13 taels, 1 mace. Transactions were quiet, with both inflows and outflows sluggish. Medium-grade sand white was priced at 13 taels, and the market remained stable. Trading in Taikoo sugar was also quiet, with CW mark priced at 15 taels, 9 mace, and 5 fen, and HM mark at 14 taels. The trend was also flat. Zhenji Factory's domestically produced cotton white sugar was priced at 13 taels, 3 mace, and the next grade at 12 taels, 7 to 9 mace, with a total of 200 to 300 bags sold. 500 bags of newly arrived Zhang Diao green sugar looked good and were quoted at 11 taels but were still less than two or six mace lower than the unified hand two or eight taels and five cents compared to the previous drop of two qian, and the transaction was scattered, the market was flat and lacked spirit, it is said.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Hunan Lotus Root Rapidly Rebounds</h3>
<p>The price of ordinary Hunan lotus root had previously fallen to 45 taels. The bottom inventory belongs to not much, and the recent sales are active, so the market price has rebounded rapidly. The price of goods to be purchased in the Han market is the smallest. The current market price needs 57 or 8 taels for Tan-style Xiang grade, the goods are still lacking, and the second grade is 52 or 3 taels to 50 taels. Changde goods is 48 taels. The trend is stable.</p>
<h3>Seafood, Ming-Style Octopus Stable</h3>
<p>Pickled Mussels are Scarce</p>
<p>New Ming-style octopus has not yet entered the market, and there is little remaining stock of old goods. However, there is no movement in customer sales, making it difficult for the market to rise. The current price of raised octopus slices is 36 taels, high-quality goods are 30 taels, and ordinary goods are 27 or 8 taels. The temporary trend is stable, and we will see how the new goods will be when they come out of the water next month before deciding the market's gains or losses.</p>
<p>The supply of pickled mussels arriving from various places this year is scarce, and the market situation has continued to rise. Ningbo pickled mussels are currently priced at 60 taels, three or four tribute grade is 75 taels, Yuan-style is 70 taels, Luzon out-for-sale pickled mussels is 60 taels, and No. 1 gathering is 57 taels. If customer sales increase, each grade may run out of stock.</p>
<h3>Xutou Woolen Fabrics: Popular Items Unwilling to Lower Prices</h3>
<p>Sales of woolen fabrics are gradually becoming slow, and prices are trending downwards. Suppliers have various difficulties and must adopt a sacrificial attitude to sell goods for cash. Yesterday, the weather in Shanghai suddenly became hot, and trading became even quieter. Buyers are not interested in cheap goods that are not in season. However, suppliers are unwilling to lower prices for items such as Huate woolen fabrics and Jiji straight tribute fabrics, as these are popular items that can be sold in all seasons. Therefore, they are willing to store them and sell them at good prices in the fall. Most of the woolen goods currently offered for sale are likely to incur losses. Although some may make a profit, it is ultimately not possible to break even. Woolen fabric stores are not placing orders with foreign firms and are selecting and buying spot goods on the market.</p>
<h3>Hardware: English Tinplate Prices Rise by 2.5 Mace</h3>
<p>Due to the adverse economic environment and the approaching deadline for large closures, buyers are hesitant to make purchases in the hardware market. However, the recent trading of 90-pound English tinplate has been very active, providing some income for various customer groups and factories. As a result, the market is booming, and prices are rising sharply. The price for each box (90 pounds) can be estimated at over 10 taels, while 100-pound tinplate can be priced at 11 taels and 5 mace. It is said that over 1,000 boxes were traded yesterday, and buyer interest remains strong, indicating the potential for continued improvement in the market.</p>
<h3>French Western Nails Experience Sluggish Sales</h3>
<p>Recent trading in French Western nails has been lackluster due to the limited demand from customer groups. Therefore, the market is dull, and prices have not increased much. The current price is only 7 taels and 9 mace per barrel, which is 2 mace cheaper than before. However, sales remain sluggish, making the market quiet. Although the supply from overseas is not large, the current inventory in Shanghai is still abundant. Therefore, it is difficult to expect progress in the future, it is said.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Life of Ōkura (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Kai Xu</p>
<p>1932. Truly a most unfortunate year in history, wasn’t it? Why were there so many incidents? This year bore the brunt of the economic downturn of various countries. The entire globe suddenly displayed an image of instability. Unprecedented disturbances occurred in both politics and economics. And prominent figures from various countries also passed away one after another in this year. Now, Mr. Ōkura has also passed away. He lived for eighty-eight years. He was a kind and amiable person who dedicated half his life to the shipping industry in the Far East. Many Chinese people knew him well. Now, unfortunately, he has passed away. I am writing a brief outline of his life as follows.</p>
<p>Ōkura’s full name was Captain Robert D. Dollar. He was born in 1844 in Falkirk, Scotland. His family made a living from seafaring. During his lifetime, three of his uncles died at sea. The ships they were on sank between Bombay and Calcutta, India, due to storms. All three perished. At the age of twelve, Ōkura abandoned his studies and became employed in a machine factory. His salary was only half a crown per week. When Ōkura first received it, he ran ecstatically for dozens of miles to present it to his mother. Ōkura lived extremely frugally, and he always saved his earnings. His mother passed away not long after. Overwhelmed with grief, his father often indulged in alcohol. According to Ōkura’s autobiography, his family moved to Canada around this time. And because he witnessed his father’s addiction to alcohol, he vowed to abstain from it for life. Ōkura kept his vow throughout his life. In recent years, every time it was his birthday, when newspaper reporters would ask him for a word, he would always say that the key to his lifelong success was based on abstaining from alcohol. When the Ōkura family moved to Canada, Ōkura was still a fourteen-year-old boy. After arriving in Canada, he initially worked in a barrel factory and then switched to working as a lumberjack in the forest. At this time, he always focused on increasing his knowledge while working. Later, he was promoted to foreman. By this time, he had accumulated some savings. However, his fate was not good. He invested all of his savings of five thousand dollars in the lumber business. Unfortunately, it failed, and he lost all his capital. Around 1880, Ōkura moved his family to a village in Michigan, USA. He established a sawmill there. The area gradually developed into what is now the city of Dollarville. With his savings, he gradually purchased public land nearby. His family’s foundation grew stronger. Soon after, he moved to California in pursuit of greater advancement. Initially, he was engaged in transporting timber to neighboring ports. Later, as the business expanded, he gradually realized that the lack of seagoing vessels was a major obstacle to the future of his business. However, after his uncles were buried at sea, Ōkura was unwilling to continue in the seafaring business. At this point, he seemed to be driven by the inherited adventurous spirit of his family and decided to revive the old business. In fact, he initially only regarded the shipping business as a sideline to his timber transportation. He never expected that today it would become a shipping business that dominates the world.</p>
<h3>The Resting Giant</h3>
<p>— Ying Ge</p>
<p>丨 Random Writings from the Old Capital - Three 丨</p>
<p>Walking into the front gate city cave, which resembles the nostril of a giant, you arrive inside the city walls. Opening your eyes, everything is black, with only sparse streetlights and the clocks on the tips of the tall buildings emitting a little light. Because I was unfamiliar with the route and lacked snow gear, I had to rely on a middle-aged rickshaw puller. After agreeing on a mutually acceptable fare, I sat in the rickshaw and headed to my desired destination.</p>
<p>The snow on the ground had already accumulated more than a foot deep. There were very few vehicles and pedestrians on the road. Only the policemen, faithful to their duty, stood like stone Buddhas in the middle of the road. The old capital, this black giant, was resting peacefully at this moment.</p>
<p>The rickshaw pulled me across a long street. Both ends of the street had iron gates. Several cars were parked on the street, quiet and clean, just as I had imagined. In my heart, I was happy about this, feeling that the old capital, after all, did not fail to be the former capital. The municipal administration of the former capital was so beautiful! Just as I was about to sing its praises, I was caught off guard by the sound of singing from the roadside. I quickly looked over and saw a soldier in a green uniform, holding a sharp rifle, strolling leisurely under a building flying the Union Jack. I suddenly realized that this was the East Legation Quarter. Immediately, a general sense of resentment drove away the joy that had just emerged in my heart. Yes, on the pulse of this diseased great power of East Asia, there is no place where brutal snakes and scorpions are not active.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Poison Plot</h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>Late spring weather, green grass south of the Yangtze River. Everywhere, the sound of tin flutes urges people into afternoon naps. This is the flavor of the countryside, the old customs of our country. Unexpectedly, those inhuman Japanese pirates actually hide their sinister plots here, in order to harm our innocent and carefree little citizens. Two weeks ago, when the ceasefire agreement had not yet been signed, in the countryside south of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, there were peddlers carrying sugar on shoulder poles. They came blowing short flutes. Village children gathered upon hearing the sound. The peddlers then set down their loads and stood there, first taking sugar and distributing it to the children, one piece to each child. When the children took out money to buy it, the amount of sugar they received was several times more than usual. Therefore, children everywhere competed to buy it, and business was particularly prosperous. One day, in Xu Village between Yixing and Jintan, children died one after another. Upon investigation, it was discovered that it was because of eating the sugar. The villagers then gathered a crowd to arrest the sugar peddlers. They caught eight people, tied them to trees, and interrogated them. They confessed everything. They were also a kind of traitor. Five people shared a boat, and each boat received a daily allowance of thirty silver dollars. The sugar was also distributed by the Japanese and required no capital. The Japanese also ordered these people to choose the gates of village elementary schools as their market, in order to target the concentrated points of children for a complete roundup, achieving twice the results with half the effort. Driven by life, they had to act as accomplices to the tigers. Moreover, because the Japanese secretly monitored them very strictly, after receiving orders, they had no choice but to carry out the killings. The villagers then questioned them about what kind of poison was placed in the sugar and whether there was any antidote. They replied that the poisoning would not cause immediate death but could be delayed for ten days. If pig liver and wild chives were eaten, it could be resolved. After the villagers escorted the eight traitors to the authorities, they urgently searched everywhere for wild chives and purchased pig liver. For a time, the slaughterhouses could not meet the demand, and the price of pig liver soared to two silver dollars per pound. This matter instantly spread everywhere, and everyone who heard the news was shocked. City tigers and grass snakes were startled, and even non-poisonous sugar was rejected and not allowed to be sold in the villages.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of World Events</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>There is a new plan between the United States of America and Canada for the Peace Garden. In order to maintain the permanent friendship between the two countries, they plan to build a Peace Garden to celebrate the peace and friendship of over a hundred years between the two countries. The area of the garden is approximately one thousand acres, with half of the location in the United States and half in Canada, generally in the area of Manitoba and North Dakota. The citizens of both countries have expressed warm sympathy for this plan. It has been decided that all the flowers and trees planted in the garden will be products of both countries, and a very large glass greenhouse will be built. The total cost of construction and planting is estimated at £200,000, and another £300,000 will be raised for permanent maintenance costs. It is truly a very good example for the current world that neighboring countries can express friendship and not invade each other in this way. Especially for our country, which has been wantonly trampled upon by the iron hooves of neighboring countries, we cannot help but admire it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Great Sale</h3>
<p>— Sun Guliang</p>
<p>Stepping out the door, you stand at the intersection of Nanjing Road. No matter where you look, your eyes are filled with "Great Sale" banners!</p>
<p>Sales happen every year, but this year is very different! It’s really a sale after sale, and after one sale ends, another one starts. It’s continuous, regardless of wind or rain, vast and abundant, forming a grand spectacle. It fully demonstrates the Shanghai of great sales!</p>
<p>Is this a sign of economic collapse after the war? Perhaps every store feels this pain! In fact, this is an objective "outsider's criticism"! Looking at the exchange rates of silver and interest rates after the war, they have fallen to the lowest possible levels. Can it be said that there is economic collapse after the war?</p>
<p>Our financial elder statesmen who are supposed to regulate the social economy are wearing short-sighted old glasses and don't care about these things. Their only creed and authority is to have made tens of thousands this year, holding the "red ledger," sitting in a carriage, and going to curry favor with Lao Chang!</p>
<p>Some say, "Your words are too extreme. Isn't our only Shanghai also on a great sale? Isn't the ceasefire agreement an invoice given to others? I advise you to turn your pen and first supervise the government, which is responsible for regulating land and has recently sold off Shanghai at a great discount!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, I was stunned, feeling that these words were very good. I couldn't help but secretly pray that the great sale of Shanghai would end, hoping that there would not be a great sale of China.</p>
<h3>Talking About Electrotherapy for Goldfish</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>I have spoken about the art of raising goldfish many times. During this plum rain season, which is the breeding season for goldfish, they are particularly susceptible to illness. With just a little carelessness, an entire tank of fish can be wiped out. Those who raise fish should never ignore this.</p>
<p>My colleague, Mr. Dong Tianya, loves fish with the same passion. His experience is also extremely rich. We often discussed ways to treat sick fish in our spare time. Initially, we thought that if the fish had fungus, then…</p>
<h3>Records of What I Heard and Saw in the Old Capital—Zhu An</h3>
<p>— Yu De Tang</p>
<p>Entering the Xihua Gate to view the books and paintings stored in the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Hall, one arrives at Wuying Hall. Northwest of the hall are three small halls, labeled Yude Tang. The hall has a bathroom. Outside the bathroom is a well pavilion, as high as the hall. In the pavilion is a well, made of brick and stone. Square water pipes run along the back of the hall, passing to the east to the bathroom. The roof of the bathroom is round like a lid. The square water pipes from the well connect directly to it. To the side is a small door with iron bars. A brick platform has steps to climb. This platform is for placing an iron cauldron to boil water, clearly visible. The four walls of the room are all tiled with white glazed bricks. It is neither a Chinese object nor modern architecture. Upon careful consideration, it is likely that Wuying Hall was originally a place for technical specialists from faraway lands to await summons. Printing books with movable type was done here, foreign languages were taught here, and specialized books were compiled here. This must have been a Turkish bathing method presented by Muslims, and the order was given to imitate its style here, merely to broaden knowledge of strange things. However, popular tradition says that Emperor Gaozong favored a certain Uyghur concubine because of her unique fragrance, calling her the Fragrant Concubine, and therefore imitated her country's customs to build a bathing hall. However, it is not considered that Wuying Hall was the outer court and certainly not a place that concubines could reach, let alone bathe. Common people are unfamiliar with national affairs, ignorant of historical events, and often make wild guesses, and those who learn by hearsay also believe deeply without doubt. It is truly laughable. Emperor Gaozong had a Uyghur concubine, and the rumors have been around for a long time. Wang Kaiyun's Xiangqilou Wenji, in the "Biographies of Notable Women" section, recorded what he heard. This is originally not surprising, but it should not be attached to Yude Tang.</p>
<p>… expose it to sunlight. However, the weather is unpredictable. There is a lot of rain in the south of the Yangtze River. If it is overcast for ten days, the fungus will spread more and more. It is a pity to watch them die. Moreover, the fine varieties are not easy to obtain, with each fish costing more than its weight in gold. We love and protect them. How can we allow them to be wiped out? This year, Mr. Dong spent four gold coins to obtain a double-tailed dragon variety, several inches long and pleasingly plump. The other day, one fish suddenly floated sideways on the water surface, looking like it was about to die. Mr. Dong was shocked and asked me for a remedy. I carefully examined the disease and found that it was abdominal fungus, with scales that could be vaguely pointed out. This was easier to treat than gill rot, but due to continuous rain, sunlight therapy was impossible. I jokingly told him, "People with illnesses can use artificial sun lamps. Perhaps it is also possible for fish. Why not use the huge light bulbs that your company's sound film studio recently purchased from the United States and shine them on the fish? Perhaps it can be saved." Mr. Dong agreed. It so happened that they were filming the sound film "Tears and Laughter" every night. He consulted with the electricians and took the sick fish, placed them in a small container, and put them in clear water. He shone the light on them. In less than half an hour, the fish that was lying on its side gradually straightened up. Then, he added a little salt and applied it to the affected area, shining the light on it again. In less than three hours, it swam freely. The fungal area showed a slight charred blackness. The next day, sunlight appeared, and he exposed it to the sun again. For the past few days, the previous illness seems to have disappeared, and it is chasing its old companions, competing for food among the algae and looking for red worms.</p>
<h3>Mad Talk</h3>
<p>— ·Yi·Qiu</p>
<p>Everything in the human world that I see is like playing, playing.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if someone starves to death in their stomach. What's really dangerous is if they have famine in their heart.</p>
<p>Humans are the dirtiest animals. The filthier they are inside, the cleaner they look on the outside.</p>
<p>A woman's flattery looks to me like the sinister smile of a demon.</p>
<p>The law is the lapdog of the rich. The poor can never get its protection.</p>
<p>The stage of Chinese politics is hollowed out by frogs and insects. If the people standing on the stage want to move, the stage will collapse, and they might even roll off. So the only secret of the people on stage is "not to move." And because "not to move" doesn't sound good, they euphemistically call it "calmness."</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Shanghai's most famous national art organization, the Chinese Painting Association, aims to promote the inherent culture of the gate and to raise the international artistic status. Preparations have already been completed. It is now planned to hold a members' exhibition of works in the scenic area of West Lake. The fourth floor of the Hangzhou YMCA is specially used as the venue. Wang Qianlv and Ye Weixin have been appointed as directors of the association. The meeting will be held for five days from the 19th to the 23rd of this month. Open to the public.</p>
<h3>The Romance of Rongma Shuanglou (56)</h3>
<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Seeking an Audience with the Powerful Often Makes Generals Fall; Imprisoned in the Prison of Love, Even Jailers Can Become Husbands</p>
<p>Liang Xiaoyun thanked Fifth Madam for her flattery. After sitting for a while, she got up to take her leave. Fifth Madam wanted to keep her to go out and watch the show together. She still insisted that she had things to do at home and would accompany her another day. Fifth Madam smiled and said, "I understand. Newlyweds are too deeply in love and can't bear to be apart for even a moment. I won't force you to stay." Saying that, she picked up a small black velvet box from the bedside and handed it to her, saying, "You should still take this back. It's your joyous occasion. How can I accept such a precious object from you before sending you a gift?" Liang Xiaoyun repeatedly refused, saying, "Sister, you can't be so polite with me. This little thing is nothing. It's not like I specially bought it as a gift. You know everything. How can you not give me face? Besides, my husband and I will rely on you for a long time in the future. If you are still so distant, how can I come and bother you to ask for help in the future?" Fifth Madam listened to her earnest words and changed her tone, saying, "You and I are sisters. Being good to each other isn't just for one day. There's no need for formality. Since you say so, it would seem wrong of me not to accept it. Then I'll thank you. As for your husband's matter, don't worry. I'll urge the old man to take care of it. You might as well bring him over one day soon." Saying this, she showed a very concerned expression and called Deshun in, instructing him, "Tomorrow, pay attention to see if the Marshal has time to meet guests. If there's a chance, quickly take the car to Miss Eight's residence to pick up Mr. An and bring him to see the Marshal. It would be best if you could come along, too." Deshun respectfully agreed. Liang Xiaoyun also expressed her gratitude and took out two hundred yuan in banknotes, handing them to Deshun, saying, "Half of this is for you to keep for spending money. As you are now, it's much more promising than following your father playing the erhu in the hall. You play the moon guitar and accompany him. You should really be grateful for Fifth Madam's promotion. You should serve her well in the future. The other half, please distribute it to the old maids in the room for me. Tomorrow, you'll have to work harder." Deshun grinned and dared not accept it. Fifth Madam said, "Sister, what are you doing again?" Liang Xiaoyun smiled and said, "It's just a small token. Sister, tell Deshun to accept it."</p>

<h3>Circular Evolution</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>There are several theories among philosophers regarding the evolution of mankind. One is gradual, one is spiral, and one is cyclical. Until the end, no one can definitively say which is correct.</p>
<p>In the era of primitive humans, people lived in caves and the wilderness. Marriage systems had not yet emerged, and men and women intermingled, no different from beasts. Later, as civilization progressed, marriage systems became stricter.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, eighty women in Vienna held their secret rituals in the mountains near Bisallaia’s Paternia. This ritual belongs to a new Protestant sect that calls itself the “Innocent.” What a “naive” term! Since the eastward expansion of European culture, the culture of our country has progressed by leaps and bounds. For example, women mostly bare their chests and wear tight clothes and short pants, fully displaying their rich sensuality and beautiful curves. Even men and women bathe together without considering it to be strange, although they still wear bathrobes, which are not entirely nude. But in the innocent, there is still some affectation. If civilization were to progress more, it would be the same as in primitive times.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most "innocent" was the era of primitive people. The course of civilized evolution is indeed circular. This can be used as evidence.</p>

<h3>Following the Original Rhyme of Master Mengtiao’an’s Spring Sentiments on the Sea</h3>
<p>— Chen Baoren</p>
<p>Withered Spring Shen, great calamity fallen,</p>
<p>Pavilions and willows shrouded in brambles,</p>
<p>High wind over the Huangpu, cuckoos cry blood,</p>
<p>Cold Shanghai, the grasses of Wusong do not spring.</p>
<p>Shattered rivers and mountains, sorrowful gaze,</p>
<p>Scattered homeland, trapped in barbarian dust.</p>
<p>Endless sad memories, New Pavilion weep,</p>
<p>Planning to visit the central stream, strike the oar.</p>
<h3>Mourning the Fallen Soldiers of the Nineteenth Route Army</h3>
<p>I still remember holding the halberd horizontally at Jiangwan that night,</p>
<p>Bearing to sigh at the passing waves at Wusong.</p>
<p>Knowing that your heroic souls are concerned with the nation's thoughts,</p>
<p>In the underworld, you must be shedding tears of sorrow.</p>
<p>Falling flowers and rain mixed at dusk,</p>
<p>Elders offering pots of wine, tears welling.</p>
<p>Death's honor is heavier than Mount Tai,</p>
<p>Relying on a cup of wine to mourn the loyal souls.</p>

<h3>Artificial Rubber</h3>
<p>— Yuan He</p>
<p>Rubber is formed by the solidification of the latex of special plants, produced in South America, East India, West India, and Africa, etc. Initially, it was only collected by the natives of South America, and few knew its uses. In 1615, the European Teande Torquemade invented waterproof clothing made of rubber. In 1770, the Englishman Priestty discovered that rubber could erase pencil marks. After several studies, its use became more obvious, not only making it into rubber cloth, but also making it soft and making various models.</p>
<p>Since the American Nelson invented the vulcanization method, the function of rubber has been fully utilized, and it has become an indispensable raw material in industry. According to the 1910 survey by Dr. p. Schibrowitty, the world's rubber supply has reached a huge 81,000 tons, which shows its position in manufacturing. In modern times, natural rubber has become more in demand than supply for industrial raw materials. Therefore, there are artificial rubber inventions.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of artificial rubber manufacturing methods. The simplest and easiest method is to mix two parts of coarse linseed oil, one part of black he oil, and fry them until they can be pulled into silk. Then add half a part of finely ground linseed oil that has been fried to a thick consistency. For every 100 parts of the fried product, add one-twelfth part of sperm whale oil and one-twelfth part of ground wax, and fry it at a heat of 252 degrees (Kolon table). Then add one-twelfth part of sulfur. After it cools, it becomes artificial rubber.</p>
<h3>Artificial Ivory</h3>
<p>Artificial ivory is white in color and firm in quality. It can be used for various carvings. It is suitable as a raw material for small crafts. It is cheap and beautiful. Here are the most convenient methods for those who are interested in this.</p>
<p>(1) Peel the skin of the potato and soak it in dilute sulfuric acid solution. After 36 hours, take it out and wrap it with non-glue paper to make it dry. Then put it into the mold and add external pressure. It will be done. However, it must be noted that water should be gradually added to the sulfuric acid solution to dilute it, otherwise, it may be dangerous, because sulfuric acid can generate great heat.</p>
<p>(2) Mix seven ounces of eggshell powder and three ounces of gypsum powder evenly, and grind them with fish glue and water. Put them in a mold coated with lard. After seven days, take them out and make them dry, and they will be no different from fish teeth. Some also mix one ounce each of fine eggshell powder and fish glue brandy, adjust the temperature slightly, and stir evenly to make a mud. Put it in the mold. After the heat dissipates, it becomes solid ivory.</p>

<h3>Explaining the Constellations</h3>
<p>— Shibin</p>
<p>Mrs. Li thought that her family had recently been stolen, losing more than a thousand yuan, and that her husband had received a threatening letter last month. She thought that her husband's fate had not been good recently, so two unsatisfactory things happened one after another. She had to find a highly skilled fortune teller to tell her husband's fortune. Just as she was thinking this, her nanny brought in a flyer, saying that a fortune-telling hall had newly opened on Chengdu Road, and the fortune teller was very accurate. No matter how bad or good the fortune was, he could calculate it. Mrs. Li was right in the middle of her thoughts when she heard the nanny's words. She immediately went out and called the rickshaw puller A San to quickly pull her to Mr. × on Chengdu Road.</p>
<p>Stepping into the fortune-telling hall, an old man in his fifties came up to greet her, saying that those who want their fortunes told should first register, and the fortune-telling fee and registration fee together were two cents. Mrs. Li gave the money. She saw that in the middle of the reception hall, there was a small square table on which there were incense burners, divination tubes, scrolls, etc. In the center sat a blind man in his thirties.</p>
<p>Mrs. Li explained the eight characters. The blind man turned his hand around and muttered a bunch of gibberish, saying, "If this eight characters are calculated according to the exact Yin hour, then the person is very strong and aggressive. If they are soft, then it is the beginning of the Yin hour, because one hour has three quarters, upper, middle, and lower. Madam, how exactly is this person? If you make a mistake with the time, the calculation will not be accurate."</p>
<p>"His temper is still okay. Everyone below says he is amiable," Mrs. Li replied to the blind man. "Then I will calculate it according to the fortune. Madam, listen carefully. This fortune is at the beginning of the Yin hour. The person is very peaceful, has food to eat, and has some family property. He doesn't need to look for food..." The blind man hadn't finished speaking when Mrs. Li smacked her lips and said, "That's right."</p>
<p>The blind man had previously heard from the people below that he was amiable, and he had already determined that he was a wealthy household. Now, after hearing Mrs. Li say this, he already had a plan in mind. Wealthy households have food to eat. Why would they come to have their fortunes told? Something big must have happened to make them think of having their fortunes told. So he continued, "Although this fortune has a lot of family property, it hasn't been good recently. It looks like you've lost a lot of money."</p>
<p>"Ah! Sir, you're really like a deity. A theft has already occurred, and thousands of yuan were stolen. But what will happen in the future?"</p>
<p>"Looking at the eight characters, I'm afraid you've lost more than a thousand yuan. It's still not enough. This fortune is really bad. I'm afraid you'll even see a threatening letter."</p>
<p>"Oh dear! It's all right! Sir, it's like you've seen it with your own eyes. Really, a threatening letter came last month. I don't know what he's offended in his fortune that it would turn out like this."</p>
<p>"There is a Xuanwu thief star in his fortune. This constellation is very powerful. If it's really offended, even his life will be in danger. You must think of a way to resolve it as soon as possible to avoid disaster."</p>
<p>"Sir, what is the way to resolve it?"</p>
<p>"Easy, easy. Just do a day of merit to resolve this evil constellation, and you can eliminate disasters and add blessings. We have Taoists here who specialize in doing merit on behalf of guests."</p>
<p>"Then how much money does it cost to do a day of merit?"</p>
<p>"It's limited, not much. We're newly opened, so we're just trying to make a name for ourselves. It only costs forty yuan."</p>
<p>"The money is up to you at forty yuan, but the work must be done properly," Mrs. Li said. She took out a ten-yuan banknote from the small wallet she was carrying and threw it on the table, saying, "This is a deposit of ten yuan. Sir, please accept it. I'll pay the rest after the matter is completed satisfactorily." After saying that, she got up and walked out.</p>
<p>"Don't be polite. Madam, please sit for a while. Excuse us for not seeing you off," the blind man said, standing up by the table. "Really talking nonsense. If I asked you to see me off, you wouldn't be able to," the rickshaw puller A San said with a grin outside the door.</p>

<h3>The Three People You Admire Most</h3>
<p>— Old Tang</p>
<p>Last year, as the summer vacation was approaching, the school exams had already finished. We had packed our bedding, ready to attend the graduation ceremony and then head home to enjoy our lovely, sweet, once-a-year summer vacation.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a notice appeared on the "bulletin board," summoning our graduating class to assemble in the classroom. The teacher arrived, bringing a stack of forms, saying they were to be filled out by us at the request of the Municipal Education Bureau.</p>
<p>Among the questions on the form was this one: "The three people you admire most." Following these words were three horizontal lines, for us to fill in three names.</p>
<p>So, those who admired political leaders filled in Washington, Briand, and Wang Jingwei. Those who liked science wrote Edison, Newton, and Einstein. Those who had always been domineering at school filled in Napoleon, Chiang Kai-shek, and Feng Yuxiang.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a classmate stood up and asked, "Teacher, can we fill in Shanghai celebrities ××…××……××?"</p>
<p>Before the teacher could answer, the entire class burst into laughter.</p>

<h3>### Road Hero</h3>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's "Road Hero," starring the king of comedy, premiered yesterday at the Paris Grand Theatre. It was sold out before two o'clock, because this film is Chaplin's ten-year masterpiece and one of the three great works he considers most satisfying. Moreover, since Chaplin is not coming to China for the time being, watching this film is like quenching one's thirst by looking at plums. The story is as follows: Charlie is a homeless wanderer who follows a group of immigrants from Europe to America, preparing to start a new life. On the ship with him is a widow and her daughter. Charlie becomes very good friends with both of them. Somehow, on the ship, the widow has all her money stolen. Charlie finds out and feels very sorry for her, so he gives her all the money he won from gambling. When Charlie arrives in America, he has no money and wants to find something to do. His stomach is rumbling with hunger, and he walks alone on the street. Unconsciously, he walks into a restaurant and suddenly meets the girl who was on the ship with him. He has to treat her to something to eat, but he only has a dollar that he just picked up from the ground. Fortunately, he meets an artist who commissions Charlie and the girl to do some work. He is very happy, but soon he is unemployed again. Because he can't afford the rent, he has to go to jail. Taking advantage of the guards' inattention, he escapes. The guards chase him from behind, but Charlie uses special methods to avoid being caught. He escapes to another city and wants to change his life, so he becomes a policeman. But there is a local bully who is rampant and feared by everyone. When Charlie takes office, he sees the bully's ferocious appearance and cannot help but feel afraid. But he is brave after all. He thinks, "Either I don't do this job, or if I do, I must defeat this bully." Charlie makes up his mind. He uses a particularly clever method to finally subdue the bully. At this time, we can see Charlie happily walking with his girlfriend on the quiet streets of the city.</p>
<h3>### Love Habit</h3>
<p>"Love Habit," which premiered today at the Carlton, is not only funny but also romantic. Briefly, a husband has an affair, and another lecherous man takes the opportunity to seduce his wife. The entertainment subtly implies a warning, which is a wake-up call for wayward husbands. The protagonist, Seymour Hicks, is not only a famous stage performer but also a very famous playwright. He has traveled all over the world and has a thorough understanding of human psychology. He wrote the script himself and played the main role. All the other actors were also carefully selected by him, resulting in this excellent achievement, which is no accident. Anyone who wants to see a good film should not miss it.</p>
<h3>### Possessed</h3>
<p>The great star Joan Crawford's latest film "Possessed" is now showing at the Cathay Theatre on Avenue Joffre. Briefly, a young woman from a humble family initially uses her body to seek wealth and status, and then abandons wealth and status to show true love. Not only is the plot sad and beautiful, but the performance is also extraordinarily outstanding. It is indeed Joan Crawford's unprecedented work. Her co-star, Clark Gable, has always been praised as a handsome man, and his performance in this film is also profound and moving.</p>
