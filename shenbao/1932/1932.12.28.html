<h3>組織蘇聯考察團濟</h3>
<p>對於蘇聯世人從不肯平心靜氣作正眼之客觀考察譽之者尊天堂而毀之者則詆爲地獄愛之者目爲人間之樂園惡之者則斥爲洪水猛獸擾亂世界之怪物即如蘇聯之工業生産品在嫉妬宥之眼光中即被指爲「强制勞働生産品」與「囚人勞働生産品」而高呼「拒絶購用」又如當五年計劃開始之際嫉妬者亦羣指爲烏托邦之幻夢而作惡意之訕笑在毀與譽兩種絶對相反之觀察下蘇聯成爲一謎其眞相遂爲世人所不易知</p>
<p>我國自十六年以來以「反共」之故因而對蘇絶交更因而進一步禁止研究有關於蘇聯之一切研究者有罪即言之者亦無不有罪在此種森嚴之厲禁下於是蘇聯在我國人之心目中乃更成爲一可怖之惡魔</p>
<p>然而蘇聯固並未被擯於此世界之外也固屹然存在於此世界之一嶄新國家也而且此擁有八百十四萬四千二百二十八方哩之廣大土地與一萬六千萬之衆多人口之國家旣未能被擯於此世界之外則無論從經濟之見地或政治之見地而言都與整個世界息息盯聯不容强加分割即其爲美或爲惡爲天堂或爲地獄亦必予整個世界以深刻之影響與强烈之反應而斷非某種力量所可阻遏準是而言則世人對於蘇聯故作誇大之頌揚固可不必而故加以醜詆亦爲徒勞吾人但當抛棄主觀之情感與着色之眼鏡對比新國家之新制度新文化新秩序及其一切作正面而客觀之考察從而判斷其前途</p>
<p>特别是我國以地勢言則與蘇聯爲接壤以經濟言則中蘇間之貿易亦極不容忽以地位言我國尤爲介於新舊兩種制度下之緩衝利害都相關聯無可廻避則吾人對於蘇聯更不容長此隔閡有若一片未知名之國土或若一終始不可解之謎</p>
<p>進一步言蘇聯之爲美爲惡爲天堂爲地獄吾人在目前自不能牽爾斷言就使其果爲「地獄」然而此「地獄」之出現於世界要亦非自然界偶然之奇蹟而應另有其必然之因果蘇聯今日之文化道德無不爲一種嶄新之創造此種嶄新之創造吾人即抛却政治之意義不言僅就學術之見地而論文寗容漫不措意何况在目前整個凋敝之世界中失業之呌喊與不景氣之嗟嘆普遍於世界之任何一角獨有蘇聯則屹立於凋敝世界之外日即於繁榮與壯大之前途從前世人所訕笑之五年計劃今日亦已被鑄成爲鐵一般之事實訕笑者一變而爲驚奇爲欽佩其所以致此基因何在吾人如不自甘爲「知識上之義和團」又寗容漠視</p>
<p>猶記過去不久蕭伯納氏曾作蘇聯之遊在其行前其家人與親友都拘臂苦勸哀懇其勿拚老命作冒險之遊歷哀懇旣不能回蕭氏壯遊之志則復殷殷爲備食物爲備臥具舉凡日常生活應用物品無不悉爲備置一若蘇聯爲不毛之地爲野蠻未開化之民族而蕭氏此行又將有若被放逐於非人之境域者然而蕭氏旣抵蘇境即備受歡迎優渥招待其家人與親友之所焦慮者適爲一極荒謬極滑稽之笑柄此無他以耳視以目聽憑一己之主觀作武斷之懸揣有以致之也</p>
<p>吾人對於蘇聯以耳視以目聽者亦已久矣自甘爲「知識上之義和團」者亦已數年矣今日中蘇之正式復交即足以證明吾人往日之漠視蘇聯爲絶對錯誤復以中蘇正式復交之故尤足以推知吾人今後對於蘇聯倍有加以精確考察與詳明研究之必要</p>
<p>以故吾人今日主張集合有志於研究蘇聯之學者新聞記者商人實業家等組織一廣大之蘇聯考察團打破對蘇聯之恐佈觀念與主觀上之偏見前往蘇聨作一次實地之考察庶幾以耳視者今後能以目視蘇聯究爲何物乃能獲一正確之觀念</p>

<p>世界社譯密勒評論報云、中國之對俄復交、又引起全世界對顯然永不終止的英俄外交戰之注意、在一種意義上、中國對俄復交爲英國在遠東外交之失敗、正如波斯之取消英波油公司讓予權、爲英國存近東外交之失敗、中國之突然「回向俄國」、係在英外相西門在國聯議會發表一篇打銷各小國對滿洲問題切實行動主張之演說之直後、此項事實斷然大有意義、英外相不知何故、大約爲商務及軍縮問題之理由、不欲與日本發生惡感、故以巧妙手段、捺擱對於滿洲問題之切實行動、於是中國在日内瓦之訴訟、陷於顯然繼續不斷的手續及形式之中　而使日本軍閥大爲得意、於是中國乃轉向俄國而與之携手矣、此項發展之結果如何、今難預料、但吾人應記得在一九二六｜一九二七年間、英國保守黨之反對中國國民革命、至少一部份致成保守黨之崩潰與工黨内閣之成立、此工黨内閣乃對中國國民革命及蘇俄同致其好感者也、今保守黨復執英國政權、恢復其對日本之睦誼、而中國則與赤俄重修舊好、此舉之結果、使英國在遠東之情報機關之旣銹的輪復行轉動、世界不久又將被告　俄人如何在遠東作種種奸詭不法的舉動、而此種告訴殆亦有一部分之實在、蓋俄人當然不在酣眠、而竭力尋覓機會以窘害英獅在遠東巢穴也、俄外長李維諾夫於十二月十三日在日内瓦抓揭英國之痛疤、聲稱「在各國中、獨有蘇聯放棄對華之不平等條約領事裁判權及其他帝俄時代所攫取之權利、」當李氏作此言時、英下院中保守黨議員幾正在要求恢復上海會審公堂舊狀、又據華報載、英國延緩交還庚子賠欵、以迫中國償付若干過期債項、此俄英兩方之對華態度、相映成趣、故中國之對俄復交、引起英俄在遠東關係之又一耐人尋味之時代、斷然無疑矣、（中略）至英俄今後在華之衝突、其發展如何、難以逆睹、但有一點似已顯然者、即從一九二四至一九二七年蘇俄在華之活動、其主要點爲對其歐洲競爭者之政治利益、今則蘇俄正在迅速發展爲一工業國、故今後恐將較注意於其商業利益也、</p>

<p>其他各國｜１·００８·０００·０００</p>
<p>在其他十國項下、爲數頗少、惟自羅馬尼亞以上之八國（俄國除外）竟担負戰債總數百分之九十六、而英·法·意·則爲三最大債務者、俄國因至今尙無還債表示、故不算入、</p>
<p>至所有戰債之用途、依據各債務國交呈美國財部之報告、其分配如下表、（百萬金元爲單位）</p>

<p>觀此表可知到今各國所還之數、僅約爲戰債元本四分之一、與其謂爲還債、尙不如謂爲償利之爲近乎事實也、</p>
<p>現在修改戰債問題、在美國惹起激烈辯論、贊成反對、是是非非、探其爭點、則不外以下理論與實際上之幾種意見、</p>
<p>在理論方面、反對修改者、謂㈠戰債一一、五六五、０００、０００金元中之四分一、是於和平條約成立後借給歐洲各國者、此數並非用於戰爭、乃皆用於關係各國内部復興建設方面、㈡各國借債照會中、原載利率爲百分之五、現在美國已以寛大爲懷、退减至平均利率爲百分之二·一三五、則美國之犧牲已甚重大、㈢各債務國近幾年來擴充軍備之預算、遠超過償債預算、則彼等並非無償債之能力、故美國决不應再有退讓而另行改訂戰債協定、</p>
<p>其贊成修改者則駁辯如下、㈠和平條約後美國借與歐洲各國之債、雖用於各國内部之建設、但其動機則爲美方欲藉此以維持各國在美之購買力、而防美國國内經濟恐慌之早日來臨、如非當日胡佛對美國政府作此類之建議、恐美國將不再借與各國矣、㈡戰債平均利率雖爲百分之二·一三五、然已爲不輕、㈢各國縱不擴張軍備、亦必無餘力償還戰債、因現在各國軍備皆以信用在各自國内採辦者、㈣當日美國借債與各國時、並未借與現金、乃以最高物價將美國商品借出、戰後物價大落、各國無形中担負加重、而各國幣值又暴跌、更提增美國債權於不知不覺中、美國有何犧牲、故美國按理論應修改戰債協定、以減輕各債務國担負不了之担負、</p>
<p>實際方面意見、則有以下二點、㈠從威爾遜以至現在、美當局無不宣稱戰債與賠欵是二項毫不關連之國際往來、現在反對修改者亦據此同樣論調、贊成修改者謂、在法律上此二項並非一筆賬目、但在實際上二者已不能分開、當初各戰勝國要求賠欵時、即有用抵戰債之意、其後楊格計劃、道斯計劃、又無一不以戰債爲對照、即洛桑賠欵會議、亦未嘗不以戰債作標準、至胡佛因德無力賠欵而停償戰債一年、則二者關係之密切更明顯矣、此後德國賠欵能力更無望、故非終改戰債不可、㈡現在國際貿易日形凋落、其主因則爲歐戰所造成之世界的經濟不景氣、欲救此恐慌、非於賠欵與戰債二問題上下工夫不爲功、如美國肯將各國担負减輕、則世界經濟可望復興、而美國對外、尤其是對歐貿易自可激增、民衆之獲得、政府之收入、每年均可較各國所償戰債爲多、又何拘拘於戰債之償還、此贊成修改者之意見、不過反對者謂去歲各國償債總數僅爲各國由美購買總數四分之一、故各國並未因還戰債而减小其購買力、（十二月二日）</p>

<h3>馬相伯先生播音講演</h3>
<p>全國同胞援助東北義勇軍</p>
<p>一人一天一銅元的義務捐</p>
<p>昨日上午十時二十分、東北難民救濟會、特爲馬相伯先生、無綫電播音演講、援助東北義勇軍、由亞美公司在徐家匯馬先生寓所、特别裝置機器、當時發音、極爲清晰、其演詞尤爲動人、特紀錄如次、</p>
<p>諸位、時候不早了、醒一醒、從去年九一八事變發生後、到現今已整整的一年零三個月了、日本政府在發動之先、料定中國是没有抵抗的能力、穏穏的可一鼓而下、正式的軍隊、誠然是給他們料到了、但是他們萬没有料到東北的民衆會自己起來反抗、他們亦許料到、像從前併呑朝鮮時候一樣、只要調動少數軍隊、至多費了兩三個月就平定了、他們可决没料到十五個月以後、民衆反抗、不但没有减殺、反比從前增加了、擴大了、這眞是他們始料所不及的、可是、諸位、這種情形、我們不必引以爲幸、更不必引以自榮、何以不足爲幸呢、因爲在事變發生時、日本軍隊很有些輕敵的、他們把我們的東北義勇軍、看作土匪毛賊一樣、以爲不經一戰的、自從這十五個月以來、他們不但沾不到便宜、反時常失敗、他們對義勇軍的態度、便一變而爲十分嚴重、他們的手段、也更加毒辣了、他們現在利用武器的優越、並且公然違反了國際公約、用起毒氣來了、他們從前不過想威脅東北的民衆、現在竟要消滅東北的民衆了、所以日本軍隊、在東北愈沾不到便宜、東北義勇軍前途的危險愈大、我們怎麽可以因小小勝利而沾沾自喜呢、何以不足爲榮呢、諸位試想、「不抵抗」三個字、輕輕的斷送了幾千里的國土、要不是東北那些士農工商的民衆奮起自救、東三省早是朝鮮第二了、這十五個月堅苦卓絶的奮鬥、是誰馬相伯先生近影</p>
<p>土山灣孤兒院製版部贈</p>
<p>的光榮呢、本月二十三日的申報上登着一段關於義勇軍的新聞、據說、馮占海的部隊、因爲彈盡援絶、不得已向西退却、渡江的時候、各級將士的家眷、事前没有能夠逃回關内的、帶着走又不方便、扔下又怕給日本人蹧蹋、說起很痛心的事、竟有把妻子殺掉了、再走的、諸位、誰没有妻子、平白的砍死自己的妻子、爲着什麽、昨天報紙、又說到義勇軍大都露宿野外、没有衣服攩寒、大家裹些柴草、或是掮個馬鞍、没有了糧食、只能把草根樹皮充飢、諸位、這又爲着誰呢、難道他們死光了、我們還能安然無恙麽、難道東三省淪亡以後、關内仍舊可以安如泰山麽、所以我看了報紙上關於義勇軍的消息、覺到現在日本用全國的力量來消滅義勇軍、若是義勇軍得不到源源的接濟、是必定消滅無疑的、同時覺到東北那些民衆、吃了自己的飯、拼了自己財産生命、爲國家爭取這數千里的領土、現在他們血肉攩着砲火、連衣食都不周全了、我們還是燕雀處堂、怡然自樂、這對得住他們麽、反看日本幾十年來、處心積慮、計算中國、自九一八事變發生以後、雖然遇着極度的經濟恐慌、還是上下一心、應付當前的艱難的局面、比起我們麻木不仁的態度來、眞是無從說起、難道我們中國是眞該亡麽、所以我們對於義勇軍、只有兩種感覺、就是「恐懼」和「慚愧」、我們若要解去「恐懼」只有盡力援助他們、他們存在　天、中華民國便一天不亡、盡力的援助義勇軍、我們能盡一分力量援助義勇軍、便盡了一分救國的責任、便減輕了一分良心的責備、我覺得最輕而易舉的辦法、就是我們從今日起、無論誰、不論老少男女、每天積下一個銅板、積成整數以後、再交到收受捐欵的所在、諸位、你們在馬路上或家門口、那一天、那一處、不一多化兩個銅板、遇了呌化子、還扔一個銅板給他呢、這般身裹柴草、口吃草根樹皮的東北義勇軍、不能和災民呌化子一樣比啊、捐助善舉、還十塊八塊的化、只一天一個銅板、難道反不應該麽、我個人就打定主意、這麽辦、年紀雖老、但是一年、便是塊多錢、諸位年紀當然比我輕的多、當然還比我積得多、如若人人能如此做、我們便無所用其「恐慌」和「慚愧」了、（老人言至此、稍息後續言）、</p>
<p>諸位、醒一醒、枕頭旁邊放了火藥、我們能睡嗎、房子裏面有了小賊、我們能睡嗎、日本積幾十年來的野心企圖、要毒殺我們、要佔我領土、不但東北三省、不但長江一帶、半壁河山、到處奸細、還有替他帮兇的呢、祇有東北義勇軍、對得住世界公道、試想「率土地而食人肉」的奸細、還能在國聯會議席上大發謬論、世界難道還有「人道」「人心」的公道麽、我們江蘇的民衆、上海的民衆當着飛機臨頭、烽火照地時候、尙能奮勇、和十九路軍一致抗日、爲國家爭人格、現在全國更應該援助東北義勇軍、爲世界存公道、希望家長領導家中大小、店主領導店員、廠主領導廠員、各種團體、從今日起、都實行「一人一天一銅元」的國民義務捐、第一、表現全民合作、與東北義勇軍、共赴國難的精神、第二、證明我國勢不可侮、因爲一人一銅元、一天就有四萬萬七千萬、若是拿同一的精神、努力自救、那麽日本野心侵略、最後祇有失敗、總之、這種、天天不忘救國、人人援助東北、日捐運動的開始、就是我們都有良心、有能力、舉國各界、一心一德、奮鬥圖存、爲人道主義而自衛、終有收復東北失地的一天、</p>

<h3>銀錢業對於現洋運赴東北之表示</h3>
<p>接濟金融毫無其他作用</p>
<p>本市最近大批現洋運赴東北、引起各界注意、市商會曾函銀錢兩業詢問、茲據新聲社記者赴銀錢兩業探詢詳情如下、</p>
<p>銀行業　銀行業同業公會秘書長林康侯氏談、東三省物産之豐富、達於全國、每年大豆高粱運赴南部、總數約二三千萬元、此次銀行界之運現出口、純爲營業性質、如㈠東三省自爲日本侵佔後、我國始終未承認僞國、則該處出産之高粱大豆仍爲國貨、商人收買、則勢須現洋、㈡東三省各華商銀行、自九一八事件發生後、當地居民不信任鈔票、吸藏現洋、對於存欵、相率提取、在事實上勢必運現前往接濟、總而言之、銀行界運現出口、毫無其他作用、况運現出口·以商號及外商銀行爲最多云、</p>
<p>錢莊業　錢業同業公會秘書長秦楔卿氏談、現洋運赴東三省、以商號爲最多、錢莊業在該地旣無分莊、自無運現前往接濟之必要、商號向錢莊購買現洋、在此各業凋敝之下、錢莊早已停止放欵、故必須現銀掉換現洋、此項掉換、純爲營業性質、例如旣有大批現洋出口、則洋厘勢必奇緊、今日（即昨日）洋厘上午爲七錢一分四厘六二五、下午爲七錢一分四厘、與前略同、可見本市存現甚厚、實爲各地工商業不振之應有現象云、</p>
<h3>鐵道部嚴厲限制免費乘車</h3>
<p>嚴格核發公務乘車證</p>
<p>兩路黃局長通飭知照</p>

<p>通令各路、除路局員司因公必要外、一律不得發給任何名義之長期免費車證、又該部員司公務乘車證、亦已嚴格規定、必須確係因公出差、核與條例規定、完全相符、方得塡發　又聞京滬滬杭甬路局、業已提前發出之明年適用長期車證、亦經該部電令、一律作廢、</p>
<p>鐵道部鑒於兩路以前濫發免票、殊失整理復興本意、經飭業務司規定嚴格限制辦法、并電令兩路黃局長遵照、所有二十二年份該項免費乘車執照、除確係因公必需者、須呈部核准　再行簽發外、其餘一律緩發、其已發者槪作無效、聞路局方面、業已奉到部電、昨并通飭一體知照、</p>

<h3>怎樣解决男女共同生活的問題李俊生君訊</h3>
<p>我是一個不配談男女共同生活問題的，論理說，因爲我雖然也有二十多歲了，却是在這個蜂蝶迷人，落葉繽紛的上海，未嘗一次和女子交　過，所以我自視對於這一問題，是不夠資格。我說這話，讀者大衆，或許要駡我是想吃冷豬頭，假充道學，其實不然。老實說，實則我有點膽怯，爲什麽呢？第一。我不過是洋行裏的一個小職員，每月所入只有四五十元，我的每月支出，大致如下··房錢八元，飯錢十二元，車費五元，娘姨倒馬桶及打衣服費二元，理髪洗潔三元·，我家有老母，每月至少要寄十元左右。這末一來，「汗乾錢了，」連一點剩餘都没有。若果你害病，吃藥，請醫生便没有着落，只有一門·當（動詞）當（名詞！）這還說是小病，若果大病來了，一來遷延時日，公司裏便要發生問題，二來醫藥這樣貴，當然是不能持久的，不但病不會好，連飯都没得吃，那只有死路一條。那裏還被想到什麽男女問題。第二，我的經騐警告我，不許我這樣的一個人涉想到這問題上來。因爲我的一個親戚，他本是一個西洋留學生，又是得了文學博士的學位回來的，只是他爲人太忠厚，不會「鑽窟窿，打洞，」又因爲他的奇怪的思想不合時宜，所以他雖有了很好的資格，很爲實的學力，很温存的性情，很光明正大的態度，我常時設想，假使我是一個女郎，我定要拼命地愛他，帮助他成功一種學問，但是他終竟因了馬女關係，被人家「拆」了一次「白！」精神上大受打擊。事情是這樣的··有一位新式的女子，就是所謂「且登」女郎，她不但表面上是個摩登女郎，並摩進過最摩登的學校，到過最摩登的地方，思想上也持過最摩登的招牌，當她還没有找到其他更適意的男子時，一次和我這位博士親戚結合了。我這位親戚持她做皮大衣，買高根鞋，買兩塊錢一雙的襪子。，他從來兩脚不挿獸慾的游戲場的，然而爲了她的原故，博士先生也不得不時常剖着她到巴黎舞場，到中央大戲院，卡爾登。這位摩登女郎本來也似乎是暫時滿足了。然而「天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍福，」他的朋友在香港吃官司，博士先生急人之急，馬上跑到香港去營救他的朋友，而這摩登女郎也，就趁空到北平去探親。趕到博士打香港回來，已經是人去樓空，音耗杳然，好久以後，才知道這位摩拿女郎又在北平過到了更愜意的男子，不但有錢而且是個官兒，常常和外國人在一塊吃「香檳！你想，以我的博士親戚這樣的爲人尙且不免爲摩登女郎所欺，我一個區區小職員，有什麽資格去的那些摩登密斯打交道，只好望洋興歎了！然而人總是肉做的，他總是要發生性的問題的，他會在工作完了之後，感到人世的寂莫，他會在交際場中，感到人生的孤獨，這實在是一件極痛苦的事！貴記者幸有以敎我！</p>
<p>答··捧讀來書，我心怦怦，恨我非上帝能在創造世界之七日間，創造千千萬萬多情善女，使「天下有情人都成了眷屬！」然而這不過是說笑話，不是解决問題，下面才是「言歸正傳。」㈠你的薪水少，老實說，没有娶摩登蜜斯的資格··若果你要「癩蝦瘼想吃天鵝肉，」那你不但是「緣木求魚，」並且是「　徒無益，而又害之，」千萬不要妄想，眞是摩登女子光顧到你，那也是只得學「老僧入定，」閉門謝絶。㈡你聽了這話，却不要發慌，這不是敎你眞做和尙、斬絶塵緣。「英雄還向草間尋，」在風塵中或是在小家碧玉中，找一個忠厚點，樸素點的女子，做做朋友，但務須設法避免生育。㈢你的親戚博士先生的事件，那是現代社會的家常便飯，不足爲奇。現在的摩登女子都是都市的生活的産品，她們在現代社會中，終日追逐片面的物質生活的娛樂，｜跳舞，電影，摩登衣服鞋襪，肉的顫動和誘惑，金錢和勢力的趨附，這便是「有閑社會」的必然的現象，就是少數在表面上受過一點新式敎育的，甚至受過革命敎育的，這班女子更糟糕。她們只是在「掛羊頭，賣狗肉」，在機械的唯物論，不是，「單純享樂」的唯物論的烟幕之下，滿足她們的肉的要求而已。她們也時常說幾句「驢脣不對馬嘴」的理論，什麽「自由」例，什麽「壓迫」咧，甚至什麽「主義」咧，做她們的辯護，其實她們是「醉翁之意不在酒，」她們的目的很單純，就是··「享樂呵！享樂！」這不是偶然的事情呵！乃是現實社會中佔有者一羣日趨没落的現象。我們就黏着這個機會給她們撞一次喪鐘罷！</p>
<p>摩登女子的没落！没落罷！趕快的没落！</p>

<h3>敬告全國大中學生實行敎育救國（七）尤懷臯</h3>
<p>（七）普遍的農村敎育</p>
<p>方法　中國據說有一千九百十一個縣、約有一百萬個村、每縣平均五百個村、内有大村一百個、今先從大村入手、只消每縣有二百個大學生或中學生、於畢業後、費一年的功夫　赴鄕村敎導農民的子女　至少三千萬兒童立刻就可以受敎育、每縣大村一百個、二千個縣就是二萬個村、每村有二個敎師敎一百五十個小孩、就是三千萬兒童、每年大中學生的人數越增加、敎師的人數就越增加、那麽受敎育的兒童也愈多、一方面由大中學生義務的實施敎育、先開其端、一方面由政府廣籌敎育經費、推廣敎育、五年以後、數千萬受過敎育的鄕村兒童之中、至少要有數百萬人可以有資格做鄕村的敎師、十年以後、敎育卽可普及、這就是普及敎育的方法</p>
<p>責任　我到鄕村中去看見布衣粗食的農民甚至於缺少衣食的農民、我并不覺得十分傷心　因爲這是我們祖宗不知敎養農民所收的結果、但是我看見無數天眞爛漫的小同胞、圍住在我四週、我却要大大的傷心、因爲倘然我們仍舊不想來敎他們、他們長大起來就是我中國未來的窮苦農民、所以我們對於這班兒童、實在負有重大的使命與責任、</p>
<p>事業　你看西北各省的荒僻、再看新疆·蒙古·西藏·西康·𤍠河·綏遠·等處大批未開闢的土地倘然各處都有大中學生的踪跡、那末諸君的事業眞帮不完了、這是諸君對於農村敎育以外的一種極大任務、所以諸君也是開僻荒地與移殖農民的創造人、再有目下國内的大銀行、正在設法將其一部份的資本在農村中流通、政府方面、亦正在努力要想拿經濟來解决農村的衰落、所以諸君到了鄕村以後、就是金融上的代理人、所以諸君在鄕村裏、是一個敎師·軍師·醫師·工程師·以外、還是一個農業家·經濟家·政治家·及創造家、鄕村是一個單細胞、諸君就是單細胞中的生命核、將來戰細胞的保存與發育、都是在諸君身上、簡單說一句、諸君就是一村中的村長、因爲不單單是敎幾個小學生識個字讀幾本書、就算了事因爲其他責任都極重大、這種重大的使命、决不是普通的鄕村敎師所能勝任所以我特别鄭重其事要請全國的大中學生來担任敎師、我還恐怕他們知識的不足、所以我要請全國的專門人材組織恊會、每日用電臺來播送敎材及實施的方法</p>
<p>希望　所以諸君以前在都市中游行呐喊的救國政策、可以改造做一個在鄕村中敎養並進的救國政策因爲都市中的觀衆心理嚴使𤍠心愛國、亦不過爲一種感情的衝動、時過境遷終歸空虚因爲他們不是諸君的信徒、决不能吸收諸君高深的意義、所以要請諸君各回到鄕村中去來造就諸君的眞眞能爲國犧牲的信徒、假使每一個大中學生、能造就十個信徒五年以後、國家就可得到數百萬救國的青年先鋒、恐怕諸君到這個時候、就要覺得租界内的污濁醜惡與可厭可怕、情願與諸君的信徒、及諸君的情侣、照諸君的理想建設你們新式的桃花源、科學化與電氣化的小上海、這是我千眞萬誠渴望於諸君在農村敎育前途的成功、諸君尙在青年或壯年的時代、還可以親眼看見諸君所造成的理想中的中華民國、</p>
<p>成功　所以這種理想的實現與事業的成功、全在諸君抱有一種爲國捐軀的犧牲心、臥薪嘗膽的愛國心、宗敎家的救人心、與探險家的冒險心、有這種精神、才能救得國、才能禦得外侮、到鄕村中去工作、才有薪可臥、有膽可嘗、方始得到十年生聚十年敎訓的眞意義、當這敎育役、應當看做當兵役一樣的嚴重、當前的重大工作、又應當看做敵人嚴陣相對一樣的緊急、農民的爲人做牛馬、受寃苦、諸君應當做他們的階梯、救他們登袵主、共享人類的幸福　諸君應當敬他們的父母、如自己的父母、愛他們的子女、如自己的子女、他們的生計要諸君解决、他們的困苦、要諸君解救諸君至少要暫時忘記酬報、與金錢作别忘記一切的榮華富貴、諸君要曉得、這是我們千載難逢的兇惡時代、這是我們千鈞一髪的生死關頭、我們現在是人少力乏、受人欺侮、所以我們要分頭去呌救兵、要費十年的工夫來造就他們、造就他們合配做我們的救國帮手、至於内地的匪衆、何嘗是生而爲匪的匪衆、他們起初也是良好的農民、所以諸君不可稍存畏腮不前的心、應當受恊會的指導與政府的的成功、也就是敎育救國的成功、</p>
<p>通·婁唐·翔公·馮陸·奎山·徐行各校、六年級爲翔中·翔公·牽山·婁唐·方太·紀王·普通·馬陸·外岡·徐行各校·個人成績前三名、五年級爲安亭吳秋瑚、南翔管慶和楊塔泳六年級爲安亭蔡愷·翔中劉榮甄、安亭錢敬立、均由縣長潘忠甲奬贈書劵、</p>

<h3>難兄難弟優游再和西人</h3>
<p>｜結果三比三｜</p>
<p>上半時優游佔優勢</p>
<p>上海西人足球隊（Ｓ·Ｈ·Ｃ·）昔年戰將如雲、雄視海上、但時過境遷、人才淘汰、承繼乏人、近兩年來、實力銳减、尤以今年爲最、江河日下、一蹶不振、誠不勝滄桑之感、今與由乙組升入甲組之優游隊、各以七負一和之成績、並列西聯會末榜、而該一次之和局、猶在西聯會開幕之初、即對優游之戰所造成、（結果爲三比二）、昨日兩隊在逸園二次碰頭、而結果又成三比三和局、是二隊者、可謂今年西聯會中之難兄難弟矣、</p>
<h3>上半時優游佔上風</h3>
<p>鐘報三下、兩隊健兒　於朔風凛冽中、由何春輝指揮下、開始逐鹿優游一鼓作氣、直搗敵營、沈柏貴帶球由邊窺進、長挑於場中、孫惠培還至門前、爲胡有成得、一舉成功首開紀錄、於是銳氣益增、縱横無阻、沈柏貴逼得角球、踢來甚佳奚巧生横身一摕、球又入門、西人隊兩球旣失、急起前抗、黃毛包备亨雄心勃勃節節進迫、十分鐘内、黃毛頭頂一球、射中一球、造成各二和局、競爭形　勢乃益見緊張西人前鋒、虎虎可畏　優激健兒、不稍示弱、精神抖擻、努力抵抗、壁壘深嚴、無機可乘、孫惠培遂由邊陲反攻、與胡有成等短傳躍進、奔至門前、孫碰然一脚、又建奇功、優游乃以三比二佔優於上半時、</p>
<h3>總結果各三成和局</h3>
<p>優游每佔優勢、似可初試禁衛、打開得勝紀錄、是以個個健兒奮發有爲加緊工作、下半時開始後、力戰十餘分鐘、各無建樹旋見黃毛怒髪衝冠、氣冲牛斗、率領大兵、犯我疆土左衝右突、銳不可擋、優游門卒梁官濂左右逢源、接應不暇球如雨點打來、任憑手脚機敏、終有一失久而入之、被柯爾巧立功而還、造成三三和局、此後優游依舊謀進取、節節進攻、西人亦不甘休、分庭抗禮、局勢仍極緊張、黃毛（包德亨）大貓（孫惠培）各顯法門、可惜先後失機、各無建樹、</p>

<h3>按摩</h3>
<p>— 廬隠女士</p>
<p>又是星期六的下午了。肖波懶懶的倚在沙發上··望着窗外明麗的秋陽，歪聲斜氣的向妻說··「㗒，這死板板的生活眞太無聊了。」</p>
<p>「你想到什麽地方去玩玩嗎？」妻柔和的問着。</p>
<p>「是阿，你想一個人工作了六天，好容易到了星期六下午、再不想方法享受享受·，不是太不舒服了嗎？」肖波依然牢騷似的說着。</p>
<p>「那麽你說到那裏去？」</p>
<p>「我想去看跳舞。」</p>
<p>「看跳舞當然是可以的，但我們俩都不會跳，到那裏作老憨也没有什麽趣味吧！」</p>
<p>肖波聽見妻的話，更觸起他滿肚皮的不高興來，連忙坐直身體，用比較嚴重的語調說道··「你總是這樣，這裏也不想去··那裏又不願去，在這一點我們太合不來了，我是極端喜歡活動的人，而你呢，就像是朽了的木頭般，一天到晚只想躱在家裏。唉。這個我們簡直是太合不來了。」</p>
<p>妻見了肖波那種面紅筋漲的神氣，心裏有些不受用，因冷笑着說道··「本來天地間要找件件事能相同的人也就少，除非其中有一個人是完全抺煞個性，以别人的興趣爲興趣·，以别人的意志爲意志，這樣就可以相同了。不然的話，就是一個父母生出來的雙胞兄弟，也有些大同小異咧，不同是當然的，有什麽希奇呢！」</p>
<p>「我想以後每到禮拜六還是分開各自找出路吧！」肖波想了一想便這樣說了。</p>
<p>「也没有什麽不可以，我從來不願勉强你同我一處消遣，如果你覺得我有時要妨碍你行爲，那你只管請便呢！」妻有些憤然的便下樓了。於是一個美麗的秋天下午，便在他俩氣惱中黯然的過去了。</p>
<p>星期二的下午，肖波由學校敎書回來······時光已經很晚了，妻連忙走近問道··「你今天怎麽這時候才回家？」</p>
<p>「哦」肖波失神落魄似的應了一聲，便倚在沙發上沉沉的思量。</p>
<p>「你怎麽了，這樣鬼頭鬼腦的？」妻笑着說，同時又用手摩着他的額部道··「你生病吧？」</p>
<p>肖波抬起眼皮來，用那一對如夢般的神秘的眼睛，望着他的妻，好久好久才低聲說道··「我今天非常難過······有一件事，我本想不告訴你的，但是藏在心裏又不舒服，所以還是造訴你吧！」</p>
<p>「什麽事？說吧｜在我的面前你什麽都不必隠瞞！」妻含笑的說。</p>
<p>「昨天我幾站到了按摩院！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽要去按摩，你生病嗎？」</p>
<p>「你眞是傻瓜，那個生病的人，跑到按摩院去送死？」</p>
<p>「那麽你到按摩院作什麽？」</p>
<p>「我去玩玩。」</p>
<h3>排天才</h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>我並不想引用意大利的犯罪學者郎勃羅梭的見解，把天才的人看作一種精神病者，一種心力没有平衡發展的狂人，而要加以排斥。天才的應當排除，不能因爲他們是精神病者而可以有些寛恕，同樣，也不能因爲他們不是精神病者而加以推崇。惟一的緣故，是在於天才和我們凡庸的不同，在我們的庸俗的社會中，我們不要什麽天才，所以要排除他。</p>
<p>我們這個社會中的最大多數人是庸人，是平常的人，絶對不是任何一方面的天才。我們庸人有我們庸人的生活法，有我們庸人自己的路，我們用不着和我們庸人不同的天才來指導領導。天才所知的，只有他們天才的生活法和天才的路，那是我們庸俗社會中用不到的，我們再也不敢希望大家都成天才，用天才的生活法，走天才的路了。庸人走天才的路，是一種不可寛恕的大錯。</p>
<p>實在這一種過失的歷史，太悠久了，從前我們庸愚的祖宗，都跟定了天才走，忘却了自己的大路，天才便以庸衆的領袖自居，庸衆也好像没有天才的領袖便寸步難行的樣子。這種錯誤在於庸衆不走自己的路而走天才的路之故。庸衆忘却了他有自己的路，跟了天才去打江山，奪天下，擁護出一個霸王天子，犧牲了百萬的生靈頭顱。成功的是天才，犧牲的是庸衆，就可知庸衆不曾做了自己所該做的事。反是種田的農人，造屋的匠人，固然未曾建什麽大功業，却給我們以食糧，給我們以屋子，我們實受了惠賜。</p>
<p>第一先認清我們庸衆的需要是什麽？我們要的不是什麽長什麽委員的頭銜，也不是什麽驚人的功業和功績，更不是什麽奬狀和褒文，我們所要的不外乎一種和平的生活，足夠的食和衣和住。我們不希望十分享受，也不願有衣不蔽體食不果腹的同胞。豪富不能人人是，我們便不希望是，我們是平庸的人，我們能有大家同一樣的生活便滿足了。像天才者的希望踞坐萬衆之上的念頭，我們要排除。我們絶對不希望能勝過别人，高出别人，我們庸衆的綱領，在於一律平等。</p>
<p>倘使有人說我們没有上進之心，是的，那便是我們庸衆的生活的精髓。没有競爭，不想做人上人，不想丢掉自己的天職，是我們庸衆的金科玉律。我們走平坦的路，不走上天梯，不想求榮譽，也免受屈辱。總之，我們平常人，只好做平常的事，不能跟了人家做平常以上的事。</p>
<p>天才和我們庸衆不同，他們有向上心，他們要往天上爬，他們要帶了一羣人馬建功立業，他們要人跟了他轟轟烈烈一番，但他們不肯獨自去幹，他們常要引誘庸衆去附和擁護，他們要責駡庸衆的不抬舉他，不崇奉他，他們要享受庸衆的犧牲，他們要吮吸庸衆的膏血，他們要做庸衆的領袖，但他們不予庸衆分毫恩惠。因之，天才是我們庸衆的仇敵，我們是庸衆，我們要排天才，不論他是殺人的天才，搜刮的天才，騙誘的天才，誇口的天才，乃到吃飯拉矢的天才，我們都要排擯的。</p>

<h3>無相庵隨筆</h3>
<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>昨晚閱唐元素庚子西行紀事，載拳匪咒語云··「一拜天門開，二拜地户裂，三請孫悟空，四請猪八戒。」據云此咒語甚靈騐，幼童得此，可敵壯夫。又不畏礮火咒云··「水凌山，氷凌洞，氷凌洞裏有氷人，」均怪誕可供一噱。</p>
<p>又錄洪秀全試士一文一論一詩題··文題云··「坦盤惑思語，紅水浸天下，上帝永約雲，彎彎日敎化。」論題云，「孝敬父母孝敬爺。」詩題云，「求魚得吳，猶餓人求飯得榮。五言八韻，不限韻。」論題所謂爺，當指基督，詩題吳字疑有誤，惟文題則不可索解矣。</p>
<p>况周頤錦錢詞，望海潮江建霞屬題日本女郎小華像，自註日本諺語云··「信州　蕎麥，情郎好顔色，不食麥猶可，遲郎愁煞我，」大有子夜讀曲韻致，不審原文何若也。</p>
<p>作者有新著出版，輙好手署名姓，貽致親友。返者法國作家之不在巴黎者，有新著出，便夾入一名剌，刋語云「某某敬呈，其人不在巴黎。」蓋明其未能手自簽署之故也。至漫遊世界之小說家保爾·穆杭則輙刋云··「遠離歐洲之穆抗敬呈。」著作家協會主席克勞特·法雷爾近以其新著LAtlantiqueenrond贈人，則附一名刺云「不能手自署名之法雷爾敬呈。」蓋谷古洛夫謀刺杜美爾總統時，法雷爾嘗蒙池魚之殃，傷手未愈，遂有此别開生面之獻呈題辭矣。</p>
<p>昔年齊盧之戰，余避居上海，夜行靜安寺路，成一截句，「亭亭璧月上依依，大　孤軍有冷輝，夜深流入錦城去，卻炤銀街舞女歸。」今日展誦，以爲頗足移咏東北也。</p>
<h3>蘇州印象記（二）</h3>
<p>— 振甫</p>
<p>我們再進去，看到很多古蹟，有吳王的試劍石，石是中裂的，還有眞娘的遺蹟。再進内有一片斜陂形的石地，石上雖有種種皺紋，但是找不到裂縫，這一片石地約有五六丈見方，好像一塊大石，天生成如此的。石的中間相傳瘞葬着吳王的墳墓，當然是民間傳說的神話了。石壁上有顔眞卿的虎邱大字，筆力非常雄偉，再從左邊進去，有所謂劍潭，繞以石壁，石上藤蘿縈繞，潭水帶着深綠色，日光到此，僅僅能夠從藤蘿的枝葉中透露進來，所以不免有陰森之氣，似乎到了絶無人境的深山中，已成另一個世界了。</p>
<p>我們走到虎丘的上面去，有幾處是新式的建築，小橋，水泥路，廳，堂，樓，閣等等，在新式建築的左邊，却是頽垣斷瓦，有一個荒凉的古塔，金黃剥落，已做了鳥雀的安樂窩了這兩面一新一舊，到也相映成趣。此外則有，寳殿僧房，和許多乾隆的御碑，這是各處名勝的禪寺所常見的了。當我們從虎丘下來的時候，在路的左邊，有一個用石子疊成的洞，據說是西子避越王勾踐侵入時所建，這種民間的傳說，也居然認眞去建築，蘇州人的好奇，也可想而知了。</p>
<p>在虎丘還有一種人，專門領導遊客，指點古蹟，和講說古蹟的傳說·，在這種人中間，我想一定有好多的民間傳說被保存着，雖則有被他們裝點杜造的嫌疑，但是倘有人能夠把他記錄出來，或許是一種很好的研究民間故事的參考材料啊。</p>
<p>在虎丘，使我們認識了蘇州的古蹟，認識了蘇州人怎樣對神話傳說的迷戀。虎丘好比是一個古典主義的殘骸，牠保存着許許多多古代的遺物·，但同時又好像浪漫主義的園地，這些古物的背面，含着許多新奇怪誕的傳說。本來古典和浪漫，有連帶的關系的，因爲對於古的迷戀，就易離開現實的人生，而入於幻想，這種離開現實人生的幻想，就容易帶着浪漫的色彩了·，拿這個假說來觀察蘇州的一切，雖未必全對，總也不大相遠了。</p>
<p>（三）斜陽影裏到留園</p>
<p>我們從虎丘出來，乘車到留園，一路上荒凉的草，淹蓋着好多的墳墓，墓石密密的像春筍一般。夕陽慢慢地下去，把雲霞照成種種的色彩，襯着遠遠的山光，使我們不時的遊目四顧，在車輪和馬蹄的聲中，一切都似電影般一幕幕的過去了。最後在幾棵綠樹陰下，我們到了留園。付過車資，購了門票，開始遊留園了。　當我們踏進了留園，第一個觸入眼簾的印象，就是留園全圖，牠完全是根據紅樓夢裏面的大觀園而築，也可以說是大觀園的縮影·，牠完全是代表着我國幾百年前的理想的建築物·，牠像古裝美女，並没有染着一點歐化的時下習氣·，牠的建築很精緻，有曲折的迴廊，和盤旋的石路，一切完全是人工的建築。我們進去，第一是看見垂絲的楊柳與矢矯的古樹，木板長橋，兩旁扶着橋欄，橋下是盈盈的碧水。又有用假山石疊成的山路，盤旋曲折，所以範圍雖然不大，却頗能引人入勝。假山路外更有很多的迴廊曲榭，迴廊都用方磚砌成，雖不很闊，也不大高，但因此自有一種幽靜的境界，没有强烈的陽光來壓迫你，祇有淡淡的光綫透進來。</p>
<h3>姊姊的戀彭雪珍女士</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>我說呢，姊姊是變了樣，在這半年來。瞧她，一向是個孩子樣兒，蹦蹦跳跳的，宛像個枝頭小鳥，她一無牽掛或顧忌·，在母親跟前撒嬌，在朋友羣裏憨笑。</p>
<p>長了這大，很自然的，她從没想到過什麽愛情，在我，也從没想到過姊姊也會和一般的長大了的女孩一樣，會被捲到愛波中去。</p>
<p>是今年春深時，姊姊來信說··「媽，怪羞的呢，告訴你，克和我要訂婚快了，我們已認識了一年，感情怪好的。眞的，以前我從没想到過愛神也會抓住我。日來攬鏡，覺得自己是站在青春邊緣上的人了，和春深了一樣，但青春是一去不可再的，媽，你别羞我吧！」</p>
<p>我怔忡着了，我從没有想到過姊姊也有浸沉在愛河中的一天，我忘了她是站在青春邊緣上的人，我忘了邱比特的金箭是在時刻地射着青年的女郎。我心頭只有姊姊的豪爽剛直的影子，却没有一些躱在愛人胸别密語的輪廓。</p>
<p>我微笑着了。</p>
<p>暑假中，爲了母親的牽掛，姊姊在溽暑中不得已地從塞北歸來。</p>
<p>那照片上的克，是很清俊的一個，怪漫柔似的，但總脫不了那副北方人特有的岸然的氣槪。</p>
<p>「你俩俩眞是緣，我以爲姊姊是不會愛人家呢。」</p>
<p>第一次我看見她頰上泛起了特别美麗的嬌羞的紅暈。</p>
<p>要看姊姊的難爲情的笑，只要說··「克在想着你啊！」之類的話便行。一個人痴痴地在門口等信是常事，等着了，便把一封信翻來覆去地看半個鐘頭·，失望了的時候，蹶着嘴暗暗地駡綠衣人無情。我是太不應该，幾次引逗得她哭笑不得，終於滿院子追着捶我。</p>
<p>晚上，當大家都在院子裏揮着蒲扇乘凉時，姊姊總獨自在樓上給克寫信。</p>
<p>「去看星星去，燈底下不𤍠的慌！哈，你呌他什麽？是甜哥兒還是親愛的在···」</p>
<p>「促狹鬼，你管不着！」</p>
<p>要着看不給，便偷點兒寫殘了的看｜駡我缺德我可不管！</p>
<p>「眞猜不出來是爲什麽，我整天地心魂恍惚着，怕人笑話，只好裝得鎭定點兒。照例，讀你的信時便心跳，我眞怕你那尖銳的眸子啊，但仍舊得看了再看。只盼望日子快飛，凉風吹去了這陣暑𤍠時，咱們便可握手了。」</p>
<p>日子不知究竟是飛了没有，姊姊終於比預定的行期早了八九天離開了家，雖然車站上大家仍免不了睜着涙眼。</p>
<p>通信上，姊姊常提及克，說他是怪忠摯活潑的孩子，并且說她是幸福底。</p>

<h3>時代与愛的歧路二十八</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>恰恰他俩都不在的時候，茶房便送了賬單來，海泉不好意思不接了。看了看，只是二元四角六分，雖然有點不願意，但也覺得數目並不多，便從衣袋裏取了小皮筴出來，檢出三個袁頭付給茶房了。</p>
<p>曹世光又從裏面出來了，一面笑一面結褲門上扣鈕。坐下來後，又斟茶喝，也不問一聲賬戰開來了没有。看見茶房送找頭來時，才裝出驚異的樣子。</p>
<p>「賬單開來了，讓我付。······那有這個道理·····老林，對不住了。」</p>
<p>「算得什麽。」</p>
<p>海泉雖然這樣說着，但心裏仍然是有點蔑視這位宗敎家。</p>
<p>「老曹。」</p>
<p>廖先生摇摇擺擺地從外面走進來了，呌了一聲「老曹」接着咳嗽了一陣。</p>
<p>「你打電話去問了他麽？怎樣的情形？」</p>
<p>「咳咳！他不在家呢。」</p>
<p>海泉看了看廖先生的正經的態度，又望望曹世光的笑顔，他疑心他俩是有計劃的騙他請這一頓飯的。</p>
<p>（十三）</p>
<p>從餐館走出來，三個人還在五馬路的　道上走了一忽。曹世光儘是緊跟在廖海峯的背後，在絮絮細語。他像忘掉了海泉還落在後面走路。看見他們吃過了飯，揩乾了油嘴，對他便不理不睬的樣子，海泉心裏異常的憤慨，同時也起了一種像給同伴遺棄在沙漠裏般的感情。</p>
<p>「老曹！」</p>
<p>他在後面呌了曹世光一聲。但是，曹世光只翻轉頭來望了望他，臉上表示出懷疑的神色，像在問海泉爲什麽事呌他。</p>
<p>「我要回去了。」</p>
<p>「走走不好嗎？」</p>
<p>「明天有功課。」</p>
<p>海泉的不高興的聲音。</p>
<p>「眞對不住了，今天實在攬擾了林先生。」</p>
<p>廖海峯說着也走前來向海泉拱了拱手，看他的意思是希望海泉快點離開他們。因爲海泉的直覺力是十分銳敏的。他對他們眞有點生氣了，但忙忍耐着。他只向他俩點了點首，反身向着公共汽車停留塲這邊走來。只走了三四步路，忽然又聽見曹世光在後面追着呌他。他忙停了足。</p>
<p>「老林，今天實在對不住你了。······」</p>
<p>他說着反隻腕搭攀到他的肩上來，裝出四馬路上的青年流氓的樣子。</p>
<p>「······今天害你花了不少的錢。我們改天再來回請你。」</p>
<p>「算得什麽。」</p>

<h3>公債期貨回漲七八角</h3>
<p>二月期貨已有多種開出</p>
<p>今日因期貨交割暫停市</p>
<p>昨（念七日）華商證劵交易所各債市况、現市成交依然稀少全日祇開出一萬四千元期貨二月期已正式開拍、如統鹽稅·二０捲·編遣·裁兵等均已做開、惟統稅鹽稅交易較多　一月期市面尙佳賣買進出不寂計前市成交二百七十餘萬元、後市三百八十萬元、合計六百五十七萬元至言各債劵之趨勢以連日已先後下降頗鉅且對日外交形勢亦非如前所傳之嚴重而本埠金融業方面、仍多從事收進以是市場人心略定除於晨初開價仍疲滯外、以後盤旋趨堅、而以下午開盤爲最堅俏但收市復轉鬆勢結果比前日回漲七八角左右、惟鹽稅·二０關·金融長期一九關小等現貨、以日來無市、價較前均跌頗鉅、債市形勢復呈混沌、又今日因交割停市云</p>

<h3>紗市略見起色</h3>
<p>｜憑藉了棉市的力量｜</p>
<p>棉紗市情微現生機、以原棉堅挺、致一部份投機商心思觀高、但實際上仍無佳象、迥顧國内縱清情形、緊急異常、且世界上之商業、均處於不景氣中、市面何能有極大漲面也所以某廠商仍抱逢漲必買主義、不遇目前藉棉市之助、暫時或有小小的升高之望、</p>
<h3>近月紗微好三四錢</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、隨上日棉市之餘威、漲二四五錢二三盤買户又缺、市面又落、結果各月漲二·三·四錢、午後聞實需不振、市氣又疲但一般投機吸收之意極濃各月跌二錢、全日成交統計二萬四千四百包、查賣出長豐三千一百包、賡豐一千包、愼記六百五十包、義餘五百包、買進同孚一千二百五十包、大孚一千三百五十包、裕康九百五十包、顧大七百包、恒昌一千三百包、元泰五百五十包、茲將收盤價列下、</p>

<p>二月一四五六　四　三五、二００　總計　二五三九００</p>
<h3>棉市過程晨漲午跌</h3>
<p>｜最後比較無多大變化｜</p>
<p>棉高晨漲午落、軋空聲勢最厲之本月棉、結果仍係平靜之局、實以大勢平淡、紗銷不暢、廠方對於高價之棉、收意較淡、惟一般投機商、以今庚各廠未購外棉、大有棉荒之象、一味傾向購進做多、市况趨緊至於外棉目前受匯兌影響　一時尙難合算、然相差尙在二兩光景、（美棉米特林現貨、在美國銀盤價二十九兩一錢）、來滬加水餉七兩、此項可紡三十二支紗之原料云、</p>
<h3>鄭標稍有參差</h3>
<p>鄭標前市開盤以上日軋以上日軋空之餘風未退、多方追進、形勢大銳、各月漲二三錢、二三盤又回落、結果各月漲五分至一錢半、午後本月份爲最後一日、二三盤甚昂、收盤跌一錢半、遠月帶下、各月跌一錢五分、全日成交統計十三萬四千三百担、查賣出申新椿三千三百担長餘三千三百担、同和三千六百担、賡豐三千担、愼記四千七百担、大昌成二千四百担、益昶二千三百担、買進信誠一萬一千八百担、長和四千担、大孚五千七百担、長豐四千四百担、源興昌二千一百担、明華二千担、恒德二千二百担、大昶二千担、愼記二千四百担茲將收盤價如下、</p>

<p>津花紗市一束</p>
<h3>西河棉市躍起</h3>
<p>（二十六日）津訊、西河粗絨花市况透露漲風、以被上海申新廠吸進一萬包之後、市面震動、進胃多數未能接近、一度微停、後經西洋商高林行買進二百包、價爲二十四兩、其他成交五百五十包、開價二十四兩二錢至二十四兩五錢較前猛增五錢、</p>
<h3>西河美種花尙堅</h3>
<p>同日津訊、西河美種花市氣、日趨堅俏、申帮及洋商進胃甚　、永安廠買二百包、開價二十九兩又洋商買進四百包、開價二十九兩一錢</p>
<h3>東河長絨棉用穏</h3>
<p>同日津訊、東河長絨棉市况、仍呈　勢、惟走銷較前稍滯、昨永安廠買進三百二十包、開價二十九兩七錢、</p>
<h3>棉紗市態堅强如故</h3>
<p>同日津訊、本市棉紗交易不多、但氣勢仍硬、玉田帮買十六支藍虎紗、價一百二十四兩、香河帮買十支藍虎紗、一百十四兩五錢、蔚州帮買二十支藍虎二股紗、一百十六兩、（津銀）</p>
<p>糧食</p>
<h3>客元銷旺激漲半元</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭不多、客元更少、而去化則有閩省各帮暢辦、胃口極旺、雖囤户停手、市價反見上騰、客元申存不多、品質較杜元爲佳、且可直接轉口、隨爲閩省泉福兩帮繼續暢辦、惟申存早經由閩帮辦去、新到不多、昨日蕪湖元米到有少數乃被閩帮完全辦去、存貨亦被搜羅　全日開出蕪湖機元九百　一包、價自十元上跳至十元零三角半、繼乃大至十元零五角、比前日售開價較大半元之鉅、贛湘各秈亦被帶起數分至近角不等、計開出江西機晚五百八十包、價八元半至八元四角半、湖南機油六百二十包、價八元九角至八元六角七分、湖南機靖二百六十包、價八元四角半至八元一角半　統由閩省泉福州辦去云、</p>
<h3>粉市午後步高</h3>
<p>｜浮空抵補···實銷甚好｜</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平穏之象、洋麥停市、一無報告惟業内外心理因現粉不豐、依然堅擯本月份以華豐略有回出、市見平定、遠期因各廠不動抛户甚稀、買户進意甚切所以市氣頗佳、迨至下午開盤、市氣又見奮發、本月份因祇半日交易、浮空非抵不可、盤盤抵進、遂見步步高昂、遠期亦因實銷客帮、心思甚好、各盤均有收進、故亦步振、至現粉情形、福新早已批售和中無貨、阜豐·申人·信大·華豐等、均照標凖直抽、不再加價、此後須看洋麥之進口、是否暢旺、方有縛平之望也、結果本月份較前日大二分、一月份大一分半、二月份大一分、三月份大一分七釐半、四月份大一分五月份大七釐半云、</p>
<h3>米市形勢站定</h3>
<p>（滬南）　昨日各帮來源約三十餘號、浦存不多城鄕店胃清淡實緣銀根暗緊、均抱落鬆、厚粳行情續短一角、早晚稻來貨亦接　本街銷路仍疲津胃有點、市價略修杜尖貨缺、價漲角半、陰化到頭略有、零銷不弱酒胃動而不爽、市照原盤變元乏貨無市、</p>
<p>（新閘）　昨日來源三十六七號、去路依然寂莫、河積尙厚　北粳頂貨開出有限、大盤約短一二角、早晚稻到銷二淡變陰元市無榮辱、埠杜尖趨勢見披、全日斛開三千石左右、</p>
<h3>麥市暫呈緩和之象</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面大致呈平穏之態以洋麥停市、賣買自少意思、更因目下所拍均係遠期、照國内小麥之枯將來交割當無解貨可言、所希望者、全在洋麥惟各廠均因現粉甚緊、不能交出、一月份之帶緊、良係此故、惟洋麥近到一船、泊七號浮簡　聞均係中小廠所定　計有八九家之多、（　新·阜豐無分）昨日起已陸續駁卸　如後步續到　麥市暫可和緩耳　結果一月份較好一分二三月份不動、四五月份無比較云、</p>
<h3>生油缺現見漲</h3>
<p>昨日油荳雜糧市較昨又見起色、各帮去路仍暢、小荳爲本廠採辦見旺、價高錢許　杜荳廣帮去路亦佳、價提五六分、故荳市日見踴躍、做開浦東杜豆二百二十包平湖杜荳三百包、崇明沙黃一百包均爲廣帮辦去其餘江北黃豆二百七十八包及正陽關黃豆三車安東沙黃一千二百包均爲本帮廠家採取各色蔴市去路亦佳　開出臨淮關花蔴一百七十包、爲洋莊辦去、九江奶蔴八包、又雪蔴十二包乃爲福州帮辦去、生仁市稍見起色、去路尙佳、開出秦皇島生仁四百包、郯城生仁四十五包、其去路俱爲廣帮、油市生油特張、荳油平定生油因現貨缺乏、去路暢旺、初開尙見平平、後即飛　、價高四五錢之譜考其原因終爲現貨缺乏之故、其去路則爲本街及泉州興化等帮云、</p>
<p>糖市</p>
<h3>新潮青今有續到</h3>
<p>數爲二千二百包</p>
<p>中砂白開十四兩八</p>
<p>昨日糖市趨勢仍穏、公會划盤二十四號粗砂白普通貨出户呌售十五兩八錢半惟淮户祇肯十五兩八錢二分半、雙方相持未有成交、八號荷赤划過數百包、價爲十一兩七錢後升至十一兩七錢半比前日升五分、十八號中砂白華新貨連日固守、昨已如願以償、以十四兩八錢開出一千包新潮青尙存尾數三百餘包、昨已如數開通、高揭青九兩至零五分、高半南青八兩七錢、次之八兩六錢至八兩五錢半、據汕頭電訊、怡生輪已由地頭開出、共裝二千二百包、今晨可以進口云、</p>
<p>南北貨</p>
<h3>泉泡圓來源大减</h3>
<p>泉泡圓前批積存之貨、業將告罄按本均須虧耗故後批來貨必稀昨據電訊、僅裝出七百餘箱、不日卽可到申云、</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<h3>陳廠絲綢銷不弱</h3>
<p>白廠絲歐美銷路一厥不振、陳絲存底充厚、絲價慘跌　内地各綢廠近以新式絲綢國内外銷路不惡、鑒於陳廠絲價已跌至最低限度、土絲質劣費工、紛紛改用廠絲、以之繣造優等線春毛葛等、批合成本尙稱合算、故自入秋以來、内地各綢廠在滬購進陳廠絲共逹一千七百五十三包、除分别裝運回廠外、滬棧尙存各綢廠已購進之中身陳廠絲二百九十六包云、</p>

<h3>答李維年君的信</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>來書云，輓近師道凌替，學風囂張，堪爲敎育前途之隠憂，近閱貴刋「明天交卷」及「小堂名」兩篇，内容所述，非特侮辱師長，抑且大損學生人格，此種記載，頗爲貴刋所不取云云，</p>
<p>「師道凌替學風囂張」誠如尊諭，殊堪浩歎，但鄙人主張與足下稍異其趨先生以師道凌替學風囂張再不應登載此種文字是先生掩尿掩屎校醜不可外揚之至意的確是先生一片婆心但是本刋登載此種文字是要使人有則改之無則加勉是一種勸善懲惡之意故我二人之宗旨雖同而見解則互有出入也</p>
<p>「師道凌替學風囂張」不自今日始，假定本刋不登此種文字師道不凌替學生不囂張現在登載此項文字的確有誘惑學生墮落及犯罪之嫌隇爲不取若不載此種文字而師道旣經凌替學生旣經囂張而其所以凌替與囂張之由原因甚爲複雜於此恕不詳述總而言之本刋絶不敢負責也</p>
<p>然因此而我欲研究學生一般的心理狀態，實屬是性善呢？還是性惡？本乔記載此項文字學生對之認爲恥辱認爲有失學生人格而改善者多呢？還是認爲新奇可喜認爲可法可師者居多？假定學生對之認爲莫大的恥辱有失學生的人格後言不堪造就我尚有什麽話說若是學生對之認爲莫大的恥辱有失學生的人格以後相戒以不敢犯則本刋所載亦未始非彰善殫惡之意雖不敢自居其功的確可辭其咎　　并且本刋自改革以來不但對於學界如此即對社會一切黑幕亦無不盡情披露盡情描寫與黑幕作殊死戰亦是此種立塲决不因爲其幕之不黑而更是提倡之使其再加一重顔色也掩惡而揚善原是聖人的態度家醜不可外揚原是宗社制度下的惡習現在我們欲用另一種手法攻破一切黑幕一切惡習使無立足之地不願再去姑息養奸飾非文過專門擺一種空塲面内幕儘管黑暗外表儘管文明這是我中國數千年來深受的痛苦亦是數千年來積成腐敗的原因不侫的見解如此不知先生對之以爲何如，</p>
<h3>農人的話</h3>
<p>— 光新</p>
<p>同幾個朋友，趁着和煦的太陽，到郊外散散步，偶然的走到茅瓦間半的村莊前面，看見一個四十幾歲的農人，獨自一個人在那青黃色的菜土旁邊，自言自語神經似的講個不停，我們很奇怪的走近他那土邊，開始對他問道··</p>
<p>今年的榖子很是豐收··今年匪盜也不曾光顧到你們這塊地方來，這大槪是天公憐憫你們，你們今年很可舒服的過個年吧！</p>
<p>先生··你那裏知道我們的痛苦呢？我們一時的安寗一頓的飽飯，恐怕都想不到，還說過甚麽舒服的年麽？</p>
<p>他說的時候，「愁眉緊鎖」，現出一種可憐的樣子，還長長的嘆了一聲氣！</p>
<p>我們很驚異的問他，這是什麽原故呢？</p>
<p>先生··前幾年的匪盜，弄得我們這塊地方，一場糊塗，不能耕作，去年的水災，洗得廬舍都没有了，這幾年的刦難，負得愁債滿身，利息要四五分，息上起息的累算上來，不到三年光景，已經超過本錢一倍半了，今年的榖子，雖比較的豐收，但是榖子的價錢，眞是便宜的便宜，索債的人，天天上門坐催，逼得我們没法，祇好把榖子挑到近的市鎭上去賣，一般的生意老閭，他睬也不睬你，等你問得討厭了，他才回頭很神氣的說一聲「你要多少錢？」可憐的我，肚子也很餓了，精神也疲倦了，講話也没有氣了，在這個時候，又不得不恭恭敬敬的回答··「聽先生吧！」如此他又很起勁和說··「昨天市價榖子每石二元三角五分，今天還要跌二角五分，你願意不？」我在這個時候，進退兩難，不得不把榖子賣了，一石的榖子，賣了二元一角洋鈿，還要一天工夫，算起來只賣得一元多錢，照這樣的價錢，還不夠耕種本錢的一半，將今年的榖子，全數賣出，還不夠今年的息錢呀！而我的家裏，共有七口兒吃飯，那裏還有一頓飽飯吃麽？前幾年的匪盜，去年的水災，弄得我們都遠遠的逃荒去了，所以幾年的田賦，也没有去完了，不料今年秋收的時候，縣裏派了十幾名如狼似虎的兵，跑到鄕下來了，他們的使命是··「催完陳欠預徵新糧，」如是嚇得我的魂魄都失掉了，半日裏還不能出聲，那些猙獰式的兵很兇惡的說道··「你們趕緊去辦錢來清我們的旅費，我們每人每天要八角洋鈿，捱到明天，越要多哩，你趕快去辦吧······，」</p>
<p>可憐的我，逼得當時哭不成聲，一句話也說不出來，</p>
<p>他們又惡狠狠的說道··「官不怕你窮，鬼不怕你瘦，」你哭也則甚，我們横直是要錢，</p>
<p>這時的我没有法子，就走到左右的隣家去借錢，那曉他們與我同病，也要預備錢來開勇費，他們的男子，都出去辦錢去了，幾個女人在家裏慌做一團，我没法只得回來，他們｜兵便咆哮的喝道··「錢呢！」這時候的我很戰栗的說了一聲「没······」話還没有說定，頭上便遭了幾棒，這時我的妻子兒女看見這個情狀，便大哭起來了，我也忍不住的大哭了！最後還是忍痛把我的價值五十元的耕牛賣了二十七元的洋鈿，用了十多元開銷他們｜兵的差費，還殺了一個種鷄給他們吃，他們才走出去，他們走的時候，睜着怪眼的說道「你三日内要去完清，否則我們又會再來呀！」</p>
<p>先生··我們的糧餉，連年的累算起來，要三十幾塊洋鈿，才還得清，呌我於三日内，到什麽地方去辦呢？</p>
<p>我在這個時候，死呢！則全家都會同歸於盡！活呢！恐怕活也活不長久了！</p>
<p>他說到這個時候，他又禁不住眼涙奪眶而出，</p>
<p>我們的心上，也忍不住的要灑同情的涙了。</p>
<p>「鄕村經濟破産，」「農人呌苦連天，」我們那會知道他們的痛苦？至於那高居洋房的要人，更不待說了，</p>
<p>「苛政猛如虎」的話，我們也有相當的認識了。</p>
<p>這段農人的話，我從我的家鄕｜湖南來的確實情形，但是昨同友人到無錫，這種「經濟破産」的情形，也同我們｜湖南差不多，感慨之餘，草成此篇。</p>
<h3>阿金</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>阿金原是農家女，生長在鄕間，伊有伊的安樂的世界，伊也是伊的幻想的人生。</p>
<p>在春天裏，清早伊便牽着一頭雄壯的水牛，踏着亮通通的露珠草地，到山坡曠野去放牛，大自然的美景，於伊是没有什麽感覺，伊只是牽着牛吃青草，别人唱山歌，伊不唱，而且還要表現着不在乎聽的神相，果然像一個鄕下姑娘。</p>
<p>夏天來了，伊還要做其他的農作事情，伊雖然纒了足，可是脚勁却還不差，六月裏幹車水工作，伊幾乎比得上二十來歲的青年漢子。</p>
<p>秋天也很忙，收稻子，伊要負一部份割稻工作·，其後幾十畝田的稻草，全</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>由伊兩手收到後園空坪裏堆積起來。</p>
<p>只有冬季伊才比較的空閒·，其實也並不見得，每天除了帮忙伊的嫂子煑飯燒茶，便是鎭日價關在房裏紡紗績麻。因爲伊的年紀也不小了｜已有十六歲，三月三日，伊已許字給常在伊腦海中縈迥的大冲劉阿喜，正因爲這樣一來，伊不但感到生理上漸漸有了變化，而且心靈也顯然有了異樣，最顯著的是每月有······，没事的時候，總是懶洋洋地呆坐出神，平日隔壁祥大向伊搭訕，甚至撫摸過伊的手，伊並没有什麽感覺··而今伊再不容受祥大這種舉動了，伊以爲那是侮辱女人的舉動，假使某個女人容受這種侮辱，那女人便簡直算不了是女人，然而伊却充滿了腦海的在憧憬着那是何等可玩味的人生生活呀！</p>
<p>伊儘管私地裏打聽自己出嫁的消息，不但往往使伊失望，而且阿喜反而到城裏做生活去了，聽說還要過多少時候，才能把伊接過去成親，伊想··「何必　樣遲緩？」</p>
<p>從此伊每日更幻想城裏的風光，祥大也曾對伊說過，垇上李四爺曾經到過城裏一次，說自己不要燒飯，肚皮餓了，可以跑進館子裏去吃東西··不租房子，可以夜宿在旅館裏··出門尤其方便，有黃包車坐，有電車坐，還有風馳電掣的汽車坐，還有·····什麽車子坐··講到玩，更是說不盡的好，有影子戲看，有活老虎看，大世界裏面有幾千年的大烏龜看，有時候馬路邊有藥水浸着的同身雙胎看，也有高的高過丈長的人，也有矮的不過兩尺多高的人，總之城裏的好，是勝過鄕下萬倍，在阿金想來。</p>
<p>可是伊也有懷疑而且不滿意的地方，那便是說有成羣的女人，到了晚邊，便四出找漢子白相··那些女人簡直不是女人，在鄕下是很少找得出來的·，因此，關於這一層，伊不大相信祥大的話，以爲是祥大故意撒謊的。</p>
<p>然而城裏總該是好的。阿喜到城裏做生活去了，可不快樂，幸福？</p>
<p>阿喜的堂弟桂生原是伊的放牛朋友，因爲伊與阿喜結了親，於是桂生更時常到伊的家裏來玩，伊的父母並不戒備他，因爲他是未來子壻的阿弟。有時候，伊也就大大方方的與他談談笑笑，不在意下，有次桂生對伊說··「阿哥在城裏快樂煞，想倷也去城裏玩玩！」伊聽了，起初是羞答答地，不置可否，後來私地想··「那不好麽，如果他帶我去·，反正我急想看看阿喜的面孔！」</p>
<p>於是阿金跟着桂生私奔到城裏去了都市病漢光</p>
<p>，只是桂生是聰明人，意帶伊到了另外一個城裏。</p>
<h3>皮大衣和捐欵</h3>
<p>— 勗予</p>
<p>天氣冷了，王小姐打開了一只箱子，向那滿箱的寒衣望了望，撒嬌地向王老爺道··「爹，我去年所做那件皮大衣，我已經不喜歡了，再給我兩百塊錢，讓我新做一件吧。」</p>
<p>「什麽？你又要做大衣了嗎？你知道你已經有了幾多件？共總化了幾多錢？」</p>
<p>「怎麽不曉得？我共總所有的皮大衣，不過八件，每件平均一百六十元，也只化了一千二百多塊錢，有什麽希罕呢？」</p>
<p>「哼，單只大衣一項，你已經化費了一千多塊錢，還不希罕嗎？况且你那大衣的皮統很好，而那三塊多錢一尺的外國呢面子，也是你自己揀頂好的，怎麽只穿了一個冬天，便要置之高擱呢？這種喜新厭舊的惡習，非但要不得，而這樣的暴殄天物，更是罪過······」</p>
<p>王老爺正在滔滔不絶的，說幾句一義方之訓，一不幸被内室的王太太聽了，替女兒辯護道··「什麽呌暴殄天物？像她這樣的女兒，又生在我們這份人家，不要說一件區區二百塊錢的大衣，已經穿了一個冬天，便是一冬要穿幾件，也不算什麽一回事，世上銀錢生不能帶來，死不能帶去，你這樣發財的老子，怎麽如此吝嗇呢？」</p>
<p>王老爺纒不過她母女，只得忍痛簽了一張兩百塊錢的支票，怏怏地出去辦公。</p>
<p>大門尙未掩上，走進家三個愛國青年，拿着竹筒捐册，向王太太鞠躬道··「天氣冷了，塞外苦寒，鳥盡獸藏，可憐我們那些爲國抗敵的義勇軍，還穿着夾衣，在那冰天雪地之中，浴血苦戰，需要寒衣很是逼切，請你太太慨解仁囊，捐助些欵項吧。」</p>
<p>王太太把她剛纔對女兒的慈愛笑容歛了，冷若冰霜的答道··「旣是義勇軍缺少寒衣，誰呌他們在那朔風凛冽的關外，和東洋人拚命呢？就是活活凍死，關我甚事呢？在這年終歲迫，經濟困難的時候，我們節衣縮食，還是愁慮着凍餒，自顧不暇，誰還有閒錢捐助他們呢？」</p>
<p>王太太這種拒人於千里外的態度，居然「不費分文，」下了「逐客令」似的，把這三個愛國青年，逐了出去。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>寢食不安的婚姻問題</h3>
<p>編者先生··</p>
<p>我本是離滬四五十里鄕間的一個孩子，家中很是貧苦，父親在上海做小販｜買賣小菜·，母親在鄕間種着五畝租田，家中的開支全賴父親勉强支持。我處於這樣的困苦環境之下，當然没有受相當敎育的機會，於是帮助母親種田度日，可是靠在這幾畝租田上，如何能長久維持下去·，况且近年來農業已瀕於破産。後來經父親的朋友介紹，在閘北的某印刷所做工人，「一二八」的空前浩刦，那一家印刷所，也犧牲在日帝國主義的砲火之下了，因此我就連帶而失業！</p>
<p>今年夏天，千方百計的想法，方經一個親戚介紹在某商店内當學徒，麪包問題總算暫時解决了。</p>
<p>最近，家中忽然又閙起我的婚姻問題來了。我是自小就由父母作主與同鄕的一個女子訂婚的。我母親的來信是··　　『······我已是五十歲的人了。年老力衰，行將就木。想替你娶了親，也完了我一椿心事。我想至遲到你十九歲，一定與你完婚。况且家中人手又少，早點娶了回來也好替替我的手脚，萬一我病倒了，也可以有人服侍，你以爲怎樣？」</p>
<p>我接到了這封信，心中着實委决不下，雖然我還祇十七歲，還有兩年工夫可供考慮，但是我究竟答應這樣辦呢？還是怎樣的推托呢？我有三點困難··</p>
<p>㈠普能的學徒期是三年，兩年後我尙未滿師，個人的經濟尙不能寛裕，怎麽負担得下··</p>
<p>㈡假使去信拒絶，則我的年老的父母必要傷心，倘或急出病來，我怎麽對他們得住··</p>
<p>㈢一個素不相識的女子，怎麽可以冒昧同他結婚？假使結了婚後，是否可以白頭偕老？</p>
<p>這個問題，盤旋在我的腦海中已有數十天了，正在徬徨無主寢食不安的時候，忽然看見貴報編行的「店員通訊」專爲我們解答擬難的問題，因此我也要勞勞你的神，請賜給我一個完美的福音。</p>
<p>徐占上謹上</p>
<p>編者按··徐君以十七歲的年紀，便能這樣的知甘識苦，並且怕父母傷心而不敢貿然回答。我們不須把道學家的什麽「世風澆漓」及「孝義可風」等等招牌掮出來，我們也要對徐君表示無限的欽敬。</p>
<p>現在如徐君這種環境之下的人，眞是多不勝計··感到與徐君同樣困難的，諒亦不少。所以我們把他公開出來，附以管見，以供大家參考</p>
<p>第一，經濟不能負担，當然以不結婚爲宜·，但是現在女子職業逐漸擴張的時候，一般女子她自己也能獨自謀生，不一定要依賴男子，智識高一點的可以當敎員或者各公司機關的職員··智識低一點的也可以到工廠裏做工··或者在街頭做縫工·，或者與人家洗衣服·，隨時隨地可以利用她的本能，去換生活的代價。不過須認識時代，以勞苦換來的生活是神聖的，决不要以爲「難爲情」。</p>
<p>同時你也要對你的職務努力，切不可抱悲觀，漫慢的自然可以獲得地位·，有閒空的時候多閱書報，智識方面能得到增進，將來遇有相當機會，未嘗不可以從事較好的事業。</p>
<p>第二，禀復父母的信上，不妨婉轉述明你的苦衷，並且懇求你的父母探聽對方｜你的未婚妻｜有没有謀生的能力，有更好·，如果没有，此時學起來還來得及。時期方面總可以商量。我們以爲暫時可以不必拒絶，使你的父母得到相當的安慰。</p>
<p>第三，現在除了智識階級以外，大多數還是舊式婚姻，事實告訴我們，絶對「自由」的他的結果亦不一定會十分美滿，這恐怕是當事人臨事太熱烈，判别力太弱的原故。我們現在不妨來把他變通一下·，旣然是你的父母自小訂定的，那你不妨借一個機會與她會面談談，或者繼續通通信，看她是否可以做你的終身伴侣·，假使没有機會的話，那你可以函託你的在鄕間的知己朋友，再與你訪問訪問，德性是否温良·，是否能堅苦耐勞·，假使是一個很好的女子，未嘗不可以「白頭偕老」。並且可以雀了許多麻煩。倘若調查或會晤之後，你認爲有不滿意的地方，則應毅然决然的拿定主意，向父母前痛陳利害，詳商善後的辦法，我們知道父母總是愛惜子女的，祇要可以成全兒子的，没有不盡量容納的。</p>
<p>總之，父母代兒子娶媳婦，是爲兒子而不是爲父母本身，所以兒子如堅絶的反對，做父母的應當予以最大的考慮，纔是道理。</p>

<h3>同情者（七續）</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>（四）雙方倒也同情</p>
<p>孟國寳在幾句談話之後，他已知道由談主義入手，王老二固然是不懂，就是文縐縐的把話深入淺出的說着，他也是不懂，這要知道他們的痛苦，不能用客觀的辦法來試探，乾脆問着他，讓他自己說，這話不要連着解講，先等一等慢慢的再說，王老二見他沉默着不作聲，將旱烟袋嘴子揑在手心裏挪搓了兩下，在褲腰帶上掛的檳榔荷包裏，掏出一撮黃烟絲，捺在烟袋頭上，然後兩手捧了烟袋桿，送到孟國寳面前笑道，抽一袋烟吧？孟國寳道，我不會這個，王第二笑道，你眞是發財的人，他却把烟嘴子塞到口裏去，噗喞噗喞，自己吸了兩口，然後喊道，拿個火來呀！客來了許久，茶燒好了没有？他把嗓子提高了一些，臉又是朝着裏的，當然，這是和他燒鍋的說話，因爲中國人是這樣，一個大家庭裏，男的高聲，便是呌妻女的高聲，便是呌夫，這是百試百應的法子，二嫂就隨着這種呌喚聲，走出來了，她一手捧了兩個鴨蛋色的粗瓷碗，一手提了一把高提梁兒的瓦壷，一脚跨出房門來，看到了孟國寳撩着眼睛皮，呌了一聲孟先生，人倒反而向後退了兩步，王老二放下烟袋，接過茶壷茶碗，斟上了一遍茶，因爲這矮桌子邊，只有一條板凳，他却向後退着，靠了一個石磨架子上坐着，兩手捧了那個粗瓷茶碗，如猴子捧桃一般，將嘴尖着，對了碗沿，孟國寳看他斟了一碗茶，放在面前棹沿上，只看那茶的顔色，黃得像馬尿一般，許多的茶末子，在碗底鋪上了一層，那茶倒是熱騰騰的，向半空裏冒着茶烟，用鼻子嗅那茶烟，還做青草氣息，因看到王老二喝得那樣的有味，就也喝了一口，又澀又苦，似乎還帶些鹹味，立刻就把茶杯放了下來了，王老二倒看出來了，笑問道，這樣的茶，你有些喝不慣吧？孟國寳笑道，有什麽喝不慣，你也是個人，我也是個人，你們喝得慣，我也就喝得慣，這幾句話，王老二倒是聽懂了，便笑道，孟先生眞好，一點也不託大，他說話時，王二嫂靠了通裏面的門框站着，一隻脚懸了起來架在門檻上雖是低了頭的，一雙眼光，却只管落在孟國寳身上，孟國寳偶然回了頭來看她時，她的頭更低着一些了，孟國寳初也不理會，向王老二道，不是我不託大，我是把事情想得開了，都是一個人，應該一樣的穿衣服，一樣的吃飯，那才是對的，可是天下事，就不能那樣，而且最不作事的人，最是吃好的穿好的，就譬如做莊稼的人罷，有的享福，有的吃苦，你是挿别人家的田的，你應该知道，你們的田租，和田東怎樣的分法呢？</p>

<p>世界要聞</p>
<h3>從日本說到中國</h3>
<p>— 靄</p>
<p>世界的舞台上··無疑的，人人公認電影是社會敎育强有力的工具，然而文化是時代性的，我們可以猜想，電影一定會被利用，作其他的利器！</p>
<p>現在我們的東鄰，已實行了電影的外交，全國的口號是··「電影政治化·，」「電影宣傳化·，」和「電影軍事化！」</p>
<p>從九一八事件到現在，我們如果到日本的影院去調查一下，其中恐怕多一半是關於東北的影片，片中所言，無非是大和魂的精神·，武士道的勇毅·，和中國的腐敗·，華軍的庸潰·，東北人民的自求解放。</p>
<p>他們知道··在世界電影上，他們是幼稚的，没有地位的·，所以政府下了很嚴重的命令，給各公司不少經濟上的輔助。使全國總動員，一致對外，對國附上宣傳，例如運到日内瓦的幾部，他們都毫不收代價·，將來更要免費的送到各國公映。這班矮小的民族，目光居然能看透了金錢上的損失，而去求國際間對於日本侵略的同情，上海之變，也可以一律的歸罪於中國。</p>
<p>這次日本影界的大聯合，不但在遠東找不着對手·，就是世界任何影界團體，也没有這麽大的蠢動力。眞是空前的異舉。據日本文部省的報告，現在專攝此種影片的公司，已佔日本影片公司總數的十分之九，素來資本雄厚的「新興」，「關西」，「國家」，「福田」，「赤澤」，「東京河合」，「大日活」，「吉川」，松石蒲田」，······無一不在其内，放棄一切其他性質的影片，而致力於中日事變，由九一八到今天，出品已有四千以上，預算到一九三三年九一八，可達八千套的整數。這種如痴如狂的「造戰」運動，日本民族的後來者，一定要食其賜的。　　這種片子外景，不少取之於上海戰爭中。其餘也用東北實景，演員呢？除各公司原有的角色以外·，上自天皇，下至侵華的下仕，差不多都上過鏡頭。</p>
<p>反觀我國，怎麽樣？所出的影片，仍是愛情，仍是摩登，似乎並不覺得是被壓迫着，是應當大聲亟呼來攝救國片子，偶然有一兩張，中央電檢會，和租界電檢會，也相繼爲難，其實我們所攝的，眞不如日本反宣傳萬分之一的利害　　我希望我們政府和人民，清醒些吧！及時而起吧·</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>鍍金的戀愛</h3>
<p>— 介</p>
<p>在現在的青年心目中，没有第三件事，更有吸引力的了·，除去金錢和戀愛｜那末昨天起映於國泰的，「鍍金的戀愛」</p>
<p>ＰlatinumBlonde，正是投人所好的片名</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>戀愛而鍍了金，　換句話說··纞愛基礎打在金錢上，｜那是人人知道，非失敗不呆的，這張片了，就是暴露了這一個要義，這片中，也有不少地方，是在挖苦新聞界中人的小事化大·，受賄和放浪，這牠没有撒謊，事實上，報界，的確不乏這樣害羣之馬｜牠還作一個介紹·，說··什麽樣的人，是異性們理想中的情人，丈夫或妻子，｜爲金錢而結婚的人，（特别是男子處在窮的一方面），受到的痛苦。</p>
<p>故事簡單的說，兩句話就可以包括一切，就是··一個窮記者，爲了訪問，認識了一個富家女，而娶了她·，招贅於她家　因爲精神上的壓迫，所以離了婚··甘心和另一個女子，同居在極清苦的小家庭中，</p>
<p>不過片中添的枝葉，非常多，所以把故事拉得很長，本來是一幕平常的喜劇，但是無論什麽地方，｜幾乎是每一吋膠片｜都是有小趣　無時不在引人發笑　那些穿挿，並不是討厭的··完全的詼諧，也並不是呌人煩倦的，不過多少就有和情理脫節的地方，因爲我們對牠的態度　並不能把　當作一齣滑稽片，</p>
<p>明星中··飾商家女的琪恩哈羅，JeanHarlow是最出色了，名義上的配角，，實際上是主角，雍雍華貴的儀態，大方而不俗，活似一個需求男性的深閨女郎·買勃脫威廉RobertWilliams，活潑的青年，用有趣的小動作和言語，不知不覺中流露着個性，｜男子的𤍠力｜不知怎麽回事，導演把極能表演的露麗妲楊LorettaYoung，降職的去飾那個另一女子，除去遠攝合兩人同寫以外，竟没給她機會去單獨作戲，然而用她作重要配角，到底給這片子是增加不少精彩，餘下的演員們，没一個不能有滑稽解頤的能力，又加上奇妙的音樂，專以𤍠鬧取勝··絲毫没有幽默的所在，可以算别創一格，光線和攝影的合作，襯得佈景非常偉大美麗。</p>
<p>各方面的綜合，功過相較，導演可以算上乘，精細是他的優長。</p>
<p>我對於全片所看到的，僅此而已。</p>
<p>三言兩語</p>
<h3>是否要有「休息」？</h3>
<p>— 宗文</p>
<p>「電影演到一半，是否要加以十分鐘的休息？」這問題在我朋友面前常常提及，他們的回答不外下列三種··</p>
<p>Ａ，休息可使我們有回味劇本的機會，來猜測故事的結果，是很有興味的一件事。｜指不看說明書而言。</p>
<p>Ｂ，一個人的眼睛，若看了一點鐘的電影，非休息一下不可！否則，恐要受害·，這是極合衛生的一件事。</p>
<p>Ｃ，休息在銀幕上是必須的一回事，不過要在適當的時候。</p>
<p>讀者們你究竟以爲這些理由多充足不？</p>
<h3>兩種白金龍互相利用</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>南方影片公司之「白金龍」影片，現已在攝製中。查薛覺先以「白金龍」一劇得名，而南洋烟草公司亦出「白金龍香烟」一種。惟上海人只知烟名，而未知亦劇名也。聞南洋公司異想天開。擬要求南方公司之影片，將「白金龍香烟」罐裝樣子，穿挿其中。今正在商洽中云。</p>
<h3>銀幕上的四郎探母</h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>每年的成例，舊戲院封箱，至少停鑭七八天。有戲癮的人，都引爲憾事。今年天一公司已拍好了一部有聲影片「四郎探母」是女角雪艷琴和譚富英合映的。坐宮，盜令，過關，見娘，哭堂，准帶回令，共演六刻之久，長八千尺左右。</p>
<p>中國舞臺劇搬上銀幕，有美國的一本「梅博士剌虎」，那是舶來品。這「四郎探母」才是中國自製的第一次。劇本是發揚中國的「孝道」「信用」和藝術。</p>
<p>這片子是天一新成立的「代攝部」辦的，所以並不是純粹天一出品，是帶着委托性質的，共費用三萬元，黃譚共得六千元。附圖如下··</p>
<h3>珍妮麥唐納小史吻濤</h3>
<p>麥唐納是現時影壇上最紅的一顆銀星，她的作品，倒處都𤍠烈受着人們歡迎，她的歌喉和美顔，是多麽　媚香艷，她是一位好萊塢新發現的銀星，自從給希佛萊合演了，「旋宮艷史」後，便名振全歐，接着又演了「法宮艷史」「附馬艷史」「紅樓艷史」，於是，便一路順風的躍登了銀壇最高峯。</p>
<p>她的家世，說來也很平凡，她是個英國人，而生長在美國費城的，父親曾一度當過優伶，她還有一位姊姊，是在百老匯的舞臺上充當歌女，她因爲年齡還小，所以跟着父親在費城某小學校裏念書。她天生聰敏，頗得敎師的讚美，同時對於别項功課也非常注意，八歲時，曾參加過當地盛大游藝會中表演歌舞，已爲一般戲劇家所賞識。</p>
<p>十五歲時，她同父親從費城到百老匯去探望她的姊姊，無意中，給戲院經理的慧眼看上了，堅請留在劇院裏當歌女，於是她從此脫離了學校生活，踏上了舞臺。經過了三年的努力，她在舞臺　得了一席地位，及許多不朽的盛譽。這時電影在美國風行遍處，百老匯的歌女，紛紛加入銀幕。但她却寗願守舊，不願更新，直到有聲電影在好萊塢開始，電影界都直向百老匯搜羅人材。珍妮也才被大道導演劉别謙搜羅了去。初次便把她和希佛萊合演「旋宮艷史」接着又「法宮艷史」「紅樓艷史」「公主艷史」「愛我今誚」幾部香艷偉作。其中雖亦曾一度加入福期公司攝了張「香閨幽怨」，但不久即重入派拉蒙，她已是名花有主了，未婚夫是呌（BobRitchie），是一位富家公子，聽說不久又將要結婚了。</p>
<h3>天一消息一束</h3>
<p>— 生</p>
<p>天一公司自代古風影片公司拍攝京劇全部四郎探母後，因發音清晰，佈景奥妙，於是又有廣東某影片公司，來與天一接洽，欲拍攝粤語有聲「白金龍」影片一部，聞前日談判成功，昨日午後已動手開拍「花園相駡」一段云。</p>
<p>天一攝成而未公映的「芭蕉葉上詩」，「東北二女子」，（即戰地二孤女），聞即將在新光本戲院次第開映，該兩片情節，收音，佈景，光線等，皆臻上乘，預料公映時，定能轟動一時也。</p>
<p>影界珍聞</p>
<h3>湯姆密克期的馬</h3>
<p>— 紫因</p>
<p>武俠明星湯姆，密克斯TomMix。他最拿手的本領是騎馬，所以他無論在那一張影片裏，都是騎着他的馬的。因此湯姆，密克斯的馬也變成非常有名聲了。它的名字是湯耐Tony，這是知道的人很多的。</p>
<p>但是有一點粗心的觀客所要被瞞過的，是，湯姆雖仍是湯姆，他的馬現在却也換了一代了。馬的年歲没有如人那般多，所以人還是那樣壯健，那馬却衰落了。這萬馬之王的湯耐，現在已優游於牧塲，享受它的殘年暮日。</p>
<p>它的代替者，就是它衣鈢相傳的兒子。那是高個兒的一匹雄偉的馬，完全像它父親壯年時一模一樣，它的名字便稱爲小湯耐TonyJr普通人單記住湯耐的名字，却不知道它已經有了一個替代者了。</p>
<p>說起老湯耐的退出電影界，一半固然爲了已到老年，遠不如往昔矯捷，一半却因爲最後遇到了一件意外。那是在攝製「藏金記」HiddenGold的時候，老湯耐不幸在後臀受了傷。湯姆决定讓這個多年忠心的伴侣，得一個好好的休息</p>
<p>小湯耐今後能不能克盡厥職，是不能肯定的。不過謡言已起來了，說是小湯耐有些「彈琵琶」，</p>
<p>那完全是因爲新近一件墮馬的事上的因頭。事情是這樣的。那一天拍片時馬是並排並的，所以小湯耐，湯姆的新坐騎，失足踏進了一個泥穴。它的脚力遠不及它的父親，它就一衝，把湯姆　了下來，撞在一根釘椿上，因此湯姆傷了三根肋骨，及内傷數處。</p>
<p>這位武俠名星已經經過了醫生的手術，將告痊愈了。他仍很信任他的小湯耐，他說他們，定能夠互相合作的，這次意外還不過是第一次吧。</p>
<p>我們希望這也是最末一次罷。</p>

<h3>Tense Situation on the Rehe Border</h3>
<p>Japanese Steps to Attack Rehe</p>
<p>Opening Two New Routes</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Rehe military front, the Japanese army's steps to attack Rehe, initially set on a three-pronged offensive, failed due to reconnaissance by our volunteer forces and military authorities. The Japanese side then opened two new routes: 1. Concentrating forces in Suizhong to attack Lingnan; 2. Launching an attack from Baitazi west of Zhangwu to Xiadong, Jianping and other places. It was decided to use the puppet National Salvation Army, composed of rebels Cheng Guorui, Li Jichun, etc., as the vanguard. On the 18th, the Japanese army launched a general offensive on two fronts. The first route was from Sanbaoyingzi towards Youyingzi, using the completed motor road to transport troops. At that time, the volunteer Li Haifeng's troops in that area resisted vigorously, and the Japanese army was unsuccessful. More than a dozen aircraft were dispatched to bomb fiercely. After four or five days of bombing, Youyingzi was reduced to scorched earth, and many people were injured. The second route was from Xinwutun to Fuxin, without major conflicts, and the damage was relatively light. After this battle, the three and four districts of Yaowangmiao in Rehe were occupied by the Japanese army. Currently, the situation on the Rehe border is still tense. The Japanese army's deployments for attacking Rehe include concentrating the Kenzo unit on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line, the Suzuki Brigade concentrating in Yixian, and the 14th Division being transferred from the Heilongjiang region to the Tongliao area, preparing to launch an offensive against Rehe at the same time. The 5th, 8th, and Kumamoto's 6th divisions are concentrated in the Jinzhou-Suizhong area for reinforcement. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Koiso Plans Military Invasion of Rehe</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Japanese Chief of Staff Koiso arrived in Jinzhou, he convened a meeting of important puppet officials and discussed with the heads of the 6th and 8th divisions, seemingly bearing an invasion plan for Rehe. The Motoda Cavalry Brigade stationed in Buhe recently transferred to Jinzhou to concentrate. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tang Yulin Reports on the Latest Situation on the Rehe Border</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin reported by telephone from Chengde this morning: 1. East of Chaoyang, the Japanese army's San Tate unit is in fierce fighting with the volunteer army near Nanling Sanbaoyingzi, with the Japanese army suffering considerable losses. The front of the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line has not yet come into contact with the Rehe army. 2. The puppet troops of Cheng Guorui, Li Jichun, and Menzixin have advanced from Suizhong towards Lingnan on the Rehe border, plotting to harass the southern route. 3. A large part of the Japanese army has been active on the Rehe border in recent days, and the situation is critical. Japanese aircraft have not been seen since the 25th, the reason is unknown. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Depart from Shenyang for the West for Several Consecutive Days</h3>

<h3>Cai Tingkai Sends Telegram Urging the Two Lius to Cease Fighting</h3>
<p>"Creating Fortune or Disaster Lies in the Slightest Thought, Protecting the Country and Preserving the Clan Hinge on the Lightest Step."</p>
<p>(Zhangzhou) Cai Tingkai telegraphed, saying to all newspaper offices: "I have recently telegraphed Chairman Liu Zigan and Director Liu Fucheng, stating that since the September 18th Incident, half of the country has fallen into enemy hands. Everyone with blood and qi is filled with indignation and vows not to coexist with them under the same sky. However, more than a year has passed, and we have only paid lip service. The recovery of Liaoning and Shenyang is nowhere in sight, and the Rehe alarm is urgent. We are both soldiers, and we should strive for the spirit of lying on firewood and tasting gall, and save the fate of the country with a hair's breadth. Unexpectedly, internal strife has continued for several months. We thought the Sichuan incident was just a temporary misunderstanding between the brothers, and they would soon be relieved. However, recent news frequently reported the war in eastern Sichuan, and public sentiment was panic-stricken and popular grievances were boiling. You are all pillars of the party and the country. Although there may be disagreements in your intentions, it is still worth considering that the Japanese invaders have seized our more than 2 million square miles of land, captured our 30 million people, and plundered our hundreds of millions of military assets and property. The three northeastern provinces are crisscrossed by hoof prints, slaughtering our compatriots and burning our houses. This is truly an eternal pain. Our blood is still there. When we think of this, how can we bear to wield weapons against each other? As the ancients said, all actions should not be painful to those who are close to you but pleasing to those who are hated by you. A true man should take the great difficulties of the country and the life and death of the nation on his shoulders. How should he exhaust his spirit, how should he sacrifice to serve the country? If he values ​​personal rights and interests, not only will he alienate his compatriots, but will he not worry about being resented by the people of the country and laughed at by enemies? Tingkai considers himself ignorant, and sincerely hopes that you will state this great meaning, inspire loyalty, cease fighting with each other, and reserve this military prestige. Heaven and people will celebrate together. Isn't that wonderful? Creating fortune or disaster lies in the slightest thought, and protecting the country and preserving the clan hinge on the lightest step. I hope all people in the country will be aware of it." Cai Tingkai respectfully felt. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

Those who love it see it as a paradise on earth, while those who hate it denounce it as a monstrous flood that disrupts the world. Even Soviet industrial products are labeled as "forced labor products" and "prisoner labor products" in envious and resentful eyes, and people shout "Refuse to buy them!" Similarly, when the Five-Year Plan began, the envious also pointed to it as a utopian fantasy and made malicious mockery. Under these two absolutely opposite observations of destruction and praise, the Soviet Union has become a mystery, and its true nature is not easily known to the world.</p>
<p>Since the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, because of "anti-communism," our country has severed relations with the Soviet Union, and has further prohibited research on everything related to the Soviet Union. Researchers are guilty, and even those who speak of it are guilty. Under this strict prohibition, the Soviet Union has become an appalling demon in the minds of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union has not been excluded from this world, and it still stands firmly as a new country in this world. Moreover, this country, with its vast territory of 8,144,228 square miles and a population of 160 million, cannot be excluded from this world. Therefore, whether from an economic or political point of view, it is closely linked to the entire world and cannot be forcibly divided. Whether it is good or bad, heaven or hell, it will inevitably have a profound impact and strong reaction on the entire world, and cannot be stopped by any force. To be precise, it is not necessary to make exaggerated praises of the Soviet Union, and it is futile to deliberately slander it. We should abandon subjective emotions and colored glasses, and make a positive and objective examination of the new country's new system, new culture, new order, and everything else, and then judge its future.</p>
<p>In particular, our country is adjacent to the Soviet Union in terms of geography, and the trade between China and the Soviet Union cannot be ignored in terms of economy. In terms of status, our country is even more of a buffer between the old and new systems. Interests are related and unavoidable. Therefore, we must not keep the Soviet Union at such a distance for a long time, as if it were an unknown land or an incomprehensible mystery from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whether the Soviet Union is good or bad, heaven or hell, we cannot make sweeping judgments at the moment. Even if it is indeed "hell," the appearance of this "hell" in the world is not a mere accidental miracle of nature, but should have its own inevitable cause and effect. Today's culture and morality in the Soviet Union are all new creations. Even if we put aside the political significance and only discuss it from an academic point of view, we cannot ignore it. What's more, in today's dilapidated world, the cries of unemployment and the sighs of recession are common in every corner of the world. Only the Soviet Union stands outside the dilapidated world and is moving toward a prosperous and strong future. The Five-Year Plan, which was ridiculed by the world in the past, has now been forged into an ironclad fact. Those who ridiculed it have changed to surprise and admiration. What is the reason for this? If we are not willing to be "Boxers in terms of knowledge," we must not ignore it.</p>
<p>I still remember not long ago, George Bernard Shaw made a trip to the Soviet Union. Before his trip, his family and friends all pleaded and begged him not to risk his old life on an adventurous trip. When pleading could not change Shaw's ambition to travel, they prepared food and bedding, and all the necessities of daily life, as if the Soviet Union were a barren land, a savage and uncivilized nation, and Shaw's trip would be like being exiled to an inhuman realm. However, as soon as Shaw arrived in the Soviet Union, he was welcomed and treated generously. The worries of his family and friends became an extremely absurd and hilarious joke. This is because they used their eyes and ears and relied on their own subjectivity to make arbitrary guesses.</p>
<p>We have been using our ears and eyes to look at the Soviet Union for a long time. We have been willing to be "Boxers in terms of knowledge" for several years. Today, the formal resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union is enough to prove that our past indifference to the Soviet Union was absolutely wrong. Furthermore, because of the formal resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, it is all the more possible to infer that we must conduct more accurate investigations and detailed research on the Soviet Union in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, we advocate today that scholars, journalists, businessmen, and industrialists who are interested in studying the Soviet Union should gather together to form a large-scale Soviet Union study group, break the concept of fear of the Soviet Union and the subjective prejudices, and go to the Soviet Union for a field investigation, so that those who have heard with their ears can now see with their own eyes what the Soviet Union is, so that they can obtain a correct concept.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Third Plenary Session</h3>

<h3>Shi Ying Talks About the New System of Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Chairman Changed to Governor</p>
<p>Still Four Departments Below</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shi Ying said that the committee system adopted by various provincial governments is loose in power, extravagant in expenses, and has not achieved significant results since its implementation. Moreover, based on legal principles and facts, it is not very appropriate. Therefore, I proposed a reform of the provincial government committee system at the Third Plenary Session. All committee members who do not concurrently hold a department position will be abolished. The chairman will be changed to a governor, who will have overall control over the province's governance. Below him, there will still be four departments: Civil Affairs, Finance, Industry, and Education. The existing Construction Department will be changed to the Industry Department. All department heads of Construction, Industry, Agriculture, and Mining will be merged into the Industry Department. For remote and impoverished provinces with special circumstances, it may be possible to change departments to sections to save money. As for the governor, as the administrative leader of a province, he should have the power to command the troops within his jurisdiction for the purpose of suppressing bandits and maintaining security. The selection of personnel should be based on the principle of using scholars, and it can also imitate the Qing Dynasty's governors and governors-general, who were scholars concurrently holding the title of Minister of War or Vice Minister, so that unified power can be expected.

<h3>The People of Outer Mongolia Still Wish to Return to the Central Government</h3>

According to their expression, except for local administration, finance, religion, and education, which are handled by the local government, all other foreign affairs and military affairs are completely in accordance with the central government's intentions. Now that China and Russia have resumed diplomatic relations, the purpose of Outer Mongolia belongs to our country and is recorded in the charter. He believes that the heart of returning to the central government is more eager than before.

<h3>Dr. Imamaki Decides on Guilt in the Assassination of Saito</h3>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 27th: After the May 15th assassination of Inukai, the government's suppression of right-wingers gradually intensified. Many ronin in the three northeastern provinces who belonged to Shumei Okawa's faction were dismissed from their posts, leading to an even more intense anti-zaibatsu movement. Okawa was arrested under the name of being an instigator of the May 15th Incident and lost his influence in Japan. His faction became even more radical, claiming that it was necessary to assassinate Prime Minister Saito, as well as zaibatsu members and senior officials of the Imperial Household Ministry. They secretly carried out assassination work. Soon after, gang members were arrested for a blackmail and fraud case, and the case was exposed. Dr. Imamaki, Obayashi, Shimane, and Makino were all detained. Today, Imamaki and Obayashi were handed over to the court for public trial on charges of conspiracy to commit murder. Makino and Shimane were handed over to the court for blackmail and fraud.</p>
<h3>China's Diplomacy Undergoing Transformation; Anglo-Russian Struggle Opens a New Era</h3>
<p>Britain's Rusted Intelligence Wheels Are Set in Motion Again</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Strives to Harass the British Lion's Den in the Far East</p>
<p>The World Society translates from the "Miller's Review": China's resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia has once again drawn worldwide attention to the seemingly never-ending Anglo-Russian diplomatic war. In a sense, China's resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia is a diplomatic failure for Britain in the Far East, just as Persia's cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession was a diplomatic failure for Britain in the Near East. China's sudden "return to Russia" came directly after British Foreign Secretary Simon delivered a speech at the League of Nations Council dismissing the proposals of various small countries for practical action on the Manchurian issue. This fact is undoubtedly of great significance. For some reason, the British Foreign Secretary, presumably for reasons of commerce and disarmament, did not want to offend Japan and skillfully shelved any practical action on the Manchurian issue. As a result, China's litigation in Geneva has fallen into seemingly endless procedures and formalities, much to the delight of the Japanese warlords. Thus, China has turned to Russia and joined forces with them. The outcome of this development is difficult to predict at this time, but we should remember that between 1926 and 1927, the British Conservative Party's opposition to the Chinese National Revolution contributed, at least in part, to the collapse of the Conservative Party and the establishment of the Labour Cabinet. This Labour Cabinet showed goodwill to both the Chinese National Revolution and Soviet Russia. Now the Conservative Party has regained power in Britain and restored its friendship with Japan, while China has restored its old ties with Red Russia. This move has caused the rusted wheels of Britain's intelligence agencies in the Far East to begin turning again. The world will soon be told how the Russians are carrying out various treacherous and illegal activities in the Far East, and this accusation will likely have some basis in reality, as the Russians are certainly not asleep and are eagerly seeking opportunities to harass the British lion's den in the Far East. On December 13th, Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov at Geneva poked at Britain's sore spot, claiming that "among all countries, only the Soviet Union has abandoned unequal treaties, consular jurisdiction, and other rights seized by Tsarist Russia from China." When Litvinov made this statement, Conservative members in the British House of Commons were nearly demanding the restoration of the old Shanghai Mixed Court. Furthermore, according to Chinese newspapers, Britain is delaying the return of the Boxer Indemnity to force China to repay certain overdue debts. The contrasting attitudes of Russia and Britain toward China make the situation all the more interesting. There is no doubt that China's resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia has ushered in another thought-provoking era in Anglo-Russian relations in the Far East. (Omission) As for the future conflicts between Britain and Russia in China, it is difficult to predict how they will develop, but one point seems to be clear: from 1924 to 1927, the main focus of Soviet Russian activities in China was on the political interests of its European competitors. Now, Soviet Russia is rapidly developing into an industrialized country, and it is likely that it will pay more attention to its commercial interests in the future.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Raise Funds to Develop Fujian Mining</h3>
<p>Capital of 10 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Local Authorities Promise Protection</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 27th: Guo Xie'en (translation), a well-known Hokkien businessman and important Kuomintang member in Penang, is currently raising 10 million yuan to develop the mining area between Zhangzhou and Longyan in Fujian Province. It is believed that Fujian Province will enjoy peace and prosperity after the 19th Route Army eradicates the communist bandits in Fujian. Many Chinese businessmen in Malaya have committed to providing substantial funds. Weng Bogui (transliteration), an important overseas Chinese figure here, recently visited Xiamen and met with Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai. He now claims that both the Nanjing and Fujian authorities are paying close attention to this plan and have promised to actively provide protection.</p>
<h3>Political Crisis in South Africa over Abandoning the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Reuters, Pretoria, 26th: The Herzog government of South Africa, in power for nine years, is facing a major political crisis because it refuses to abandon the gold standard and lower the currency value. The fate of the cabinet is now uncertain and may be decided within days. Herzog and his cabinet members held an important meeting today to discuss the political situation, which ended after four hours. They then urgently summoned Reserve Bank Governor Postmus and Finance Minister Havenga for private talks, which lasted for several hours. Havenga went to see Prime Minister Herzog to discuss everything. Several Reserve Bank employees who had taken leave of absence have now been recalled. The seriousness of the situation is evident. The entire country is in a state of panic and unrest due to the political crisis. Farmers are now supporting Roos' policy of lowering the currency value. Roos has now resigned from his position in the Court of Appeal to re-enter politics and implement his policy. The general public is now paying close attention to the operations of the banks on Wednesday to see whether they will maintain unlimited exchange rates or impose restrictions through emergency measures. It is estimated that millions of gold pounds have flowed out of the country in the past few days. Speculators predict that this political crisis will result in the abandonment of the gold standard. Business people are now preparing to cope with the changes in the situation.</p>

<h3>Railway Minister Makes a Plea to Suzuki</h3>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 27th: Although the Japanese Parliament has announced a temporary adjournment and will reconvene on January 20th next spring, the Seiyukai's radical faction's movement to overthrow the cabinet and force Railway Minister Mitsuchi to step down over the railway accounting issue is still intensifying. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Railway Minister Mitsuchi visited Seiyukai President Suzuki and pleaded for understanding on the railway accounting issue. He also explained the current domestic and foreign situation in detail, hoping that the Seiyukai would not attack the Saito cabinet too much. They talked for an hour before he left.</p>
<h3>Famous Dancer Plots to Assassinate Italian Leader Due to Lover's Tragic Death</h3>
<p>Sentenced to 30 Years in Prison</p>
<p>Austrians Rise Up to Rescue Her</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 26th: Austrian dancer Bella Hahr, known for her beauty, was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June for participating in a conspiracy to assassinate Italian leader Mussolini. After the conviction, Austrians have continuously petitioned for a pardon. Italian leader Mussolini has now ordered her release. It has been found that Bowen, who was said to be Hahr's lover, was the leader of a rebel group and has been executed. When Bella Hahr was arrested and tried, she cried throughout the process, while the other defendants claimed that the police had used torture to extract confessions. As a result of the trial, Bella Hahr and five others were each sentenced to 30 years of imprisonment, while another person was imprisoned for two years. It is reported that the rebel group had thrown bombs in Genoa, Turin, and Bologna, with the main purpose of assassinating Mussolini. The case has attracted national attention. After Bella Hahr was released from prison, she was escorted by police onto a special train and taken to the border. The operation was extremely confidential to avoid causing disputes. The Austrian ambassador to Italy stated to the Italian leader that Bella Hahr's release would have a positive impact on Austro-Italian relations.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Radio Station Broadcasts "Ming Qing Music"</h3>
<p>Ancient Chinese Music Almost Extinct</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 27th: Ancient Chinese music has become almost extinct in China, but it is still preserved in Japan. Today, Tokyo Radio Station broadcasted this piece of music, called "Ming Qing Music" (translation). It is said to be folk music from the Ming Dynasty that was brought to Nagasaki, Japan by Chinese people at the end of the Ming Dynasty and has been passed down through generations of a certain family to this day.</p>
<h3>Hoover Shifting Blame to Roosevelt on Handling War Debt Issues</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Secretly Consults with Davis and Others</p>
<p>French Newspapers Welcome Smith to the Stage</p>
<h3>US Allows Greece to Defer Payment for Two Years</h3>
<p>Havas, Washington, 25th: Today, newly elected President Roosevelt and Davis had their first discussion on the war debt issue. President Hoover's desire to shift the responsibility for resolving the war debt issue to Roosevelt is growing stronger. Roosevelt seems to be discussing war debts with various advisors, such as Young, but the details of the discussions are extremely secret. The public believes that after Roosevelt takes office next spring, he will immediately convene an extraordinary session of Congress. At that time, the issues to be discussed will not only be how to avoid default by the debtor countries when the war debts mature in June but also to study various emergency issues, such as ㈠ the manufacture and sale of beer, ㈡ the various benefits that should be given to farmers, and ㈢ balancing the budget. It is believed that President Hoover intends to ask Congress to allow him the freedom to reduce government spending, for example, the fund for relieving veterans will be reduced by 400 million US dollars.</p>
<p>Reuters, Albany, 27th: Last night, President-elect Roosevelt and Davis held an important meeting to discuss major issues such as disarmament, the World Economic Conference, tariff reform, stabilizing the yen, and raising silver prices. Davis said, "We now need disarmament to restore trust, because trust is the generator of lending, and lending is the engine of commerce." Davis recently represented the United States in Europe to discuss disarmament and financial issues. He will soon return from here to Washington to continue talks with President Hoover.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 26th: "Le Journal" commented on New York Governor Smith, calling him "the son of a coachman, the future Minister of Interior." Because Smith was the son of a poor man, his intelligence and talent are extraordinary, so he was elected as the Governor of New York. Smith's observation of American public opinion is very thorough. From the intellectuals and wealthy people to the hawkers and peddlers, everyone understands his psychology. His lifelong efforts are to improve the lives of the lower classes, but he also does not make the upper classes feel unfair. During this year's presidential election, Roosevelt received Smith's great assistance. The most noteworthy aspect of Smith's political platform for the French is his view on war debts. Smith believes that if the total amount of war debts and their repayment period are modified, not only will the whole world benefit, but the United States will also benefit. During a speech in support of his friend Roosevelt this fall, he said, "Germany is our old enemy, and we cannot be more lenient towards Germany than towards our old allies." This warning is very thought-provoking. Therefore, "Le Journal" concluded that "France only asks for this from the United States."</p>
<p>Havas, Athens, 26th: The United States government has agreed to extend the grace period for Greece's outstanding war debt to the United States until the end of 1934.</p>
<h3>French Arms Factories Profit Amid World Expansion of Armaments</h3>
<p>Krupp Factory in Germany</p>
<p>Transforms Into Manufacturing Industrial Products; Business is Sluggish</p>
<p>"Guomin Bao," Berlin, 26th: Schneider-Creusot, the largest arms factory in France, is experiencing booming business this year, and it is expected to earn a 25% dividend by the end of April next year.</p>
<p>Another dispatch states: Krupp, a large arms factory in Germany that was famous before the war, has transformed into manufacturing other industrial products after the war. It produces a wide variety of products, including locomotives, safes, fountain pens, artificial teeth, etc. However, due to the economic depression, it suffered a loss of 15 million marks this year, which is about 10% of the stock value. However, because there are reserves to offset the losses, business can still be maintained.</p>
<h3>Plot to Bomb Egyptian King Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 26th: A bomb was found in the garden of the government engineering school today. The bomb was a dangerous timed explosive, and its purpose was to assassinate Egyptian King Fuad. The time set for the explosion was when the Egyptian King was scheduled to arrive at the school. Fortunately, the Egyptian King did not arrive, and the bomb was discovered and destroyed. The person who planted the bomb has not yet been found.</p>
<p>Havas, Cairo, 27th: According to "Siyasa," someone sent a letter to the Director of the Political Bureau claiming to be the main culprit behind yesterday's assassination attempt at the engineering school. The letter stated that the bomb was placed by them, and the recent political assassinations and the bombing of the British High Commissioner's residence on the 11th of this month were specifically intended to assassinate the British High Commissioner himself and also to show the police that they could do nothing about them.</p>
<h3>"Revival Machine" Brings Back to Life</h3>
<p>A Needle Inserted into the Heart</p>
<p>Has Inconceivable Effects</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 26th: A London correspondent for "Le Matin" reports that Dr. Heimendinger, an American doctor, has invented a "revival machine" for people who have died from accidental disasters or diseases. The machine has recently been successfully tested. The main part of the machine is a needle that is used to insert into the heart chamber. With the guidance of the needle, electricity is used to make the heart vibrate. The number of vibrations is exactly the same as the normal vibrations of the heart. The inventor of the "revival machine" claims that he has used the "revival machine" on animals that have been dead for several hours and whose deaths have been scientifically proven, and all of them have been effective. In more than 2,000 experiments, only one has failed to revive. Once the machine is used, it can make the blood flow normally, the lungs breathe normally, and there is no danger in using the machine. He has been asking the parents of seriously ill people to notify him at any time, and he will go to rescue them so that the patients can avoid death. However, no one has dared to respond to the call for volunteers so far.</p>
<h3>Panic in Japanese Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Aggressive Militarism Turns Farmers into Starving People</p>
<p>Elementary School Students Attend Class with Empty Stomachs</p>
<p>Monks Can't Recite "Amitabha Buddha"</p>
<p>China United Press Hokkaido Correspondence: Because of the panic in Japanese rural areas, it has reached its peak. In addition, wars are constantly starting. Farmers in the Nemuro and Kushiro areas of Hokkaido have been struggling on the starvation line due to floods and crop failures for years. Recently, cases of village heads in Nemuro, Kunigishi, and Mai Village of Hokkaido embezzling public relief funds have occurred, which has aroused the anger of more than 2,000 poor farmers, who have planned riots and assassinations of village heads and other unstable events. Monks belonging to the Buddhist sects' alms houses in the area have also surrounded the Hokkaido government, requesting 20 yen per person per month as a living subsidy because the farmers are unable to provide living expenses. The Hokkaido government has held various discussions, but because there are too many poor people in general, the Hokkaido government cannot come up with a solution. Therefore, these social parasites who chant "Namo Amitabha Buddha" to save all living beings have also created various unstable trends under the pressure of hunger and cold and have also participated in the farmers' struggles.</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 27th: According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Education, there are more than 481,000 elementary school students in Hokkaido. In the spring of this year, more than 4,000 students owed lunch fees due to family poverty. Due to the floods this summer, the entire island suffered huge losses. This autumn, there was a poor harvest of grains, and the lives of farmers became even more difficult. The number of students owing lunch fees has reached more than 50,000, or one-tenth. The Ministry of Education is very embarrassed and wants to find a way to provide relief. Starting next month, the schools will provide meals for students owing lunch fees.</p>

<h3>Analysis of War Debt Relations: New York Correspondence</h3>
<p>The greatest dispute currently between Europe and the the United States is the war debt issue. This issue not only has a significant relationship with international politics, but also the revival of the world economy depends on a reasonable resolution of this problem.  A concise explanation and diagram of its history and opinions are provided below, in order to understand the crux of the matter.</p>
<p>Before and after the peace treaty, a total of twenty European countries borrowed money from the United States, totaling $10,338,000,000. The distribution among countries is shown in the following table (in millions of gold dollars, see Figure 1):</p>
<p>Country          Before Peace Treaty      After Peace Treaty     Total</p>
<p>British Empire       3,696                     581                   4,277</p>

<p>Italy                  1,031                    617                    1,648</p>
<p>Belgium                172                     207                   379</p>
<p>Russia                 188                     5                     193</p>
<p>Poland                 160                     -                     160</p>

<p>Romania                38                      -                     38</p>
<p>Austria                24                      -                     24</p>
<p>Other Fourteen       10                      60                    70</p>
<p>Total                7,077                    3,261                  10,338</p>

<p>10,338,000,000</p>
<p>Other Countries 10%   UK 41%   France 33%  Italy 16%</p>
<p>UK | 4,277,000,000</p>
<p>France | 3,405,000,000</p>
<p>Italy | 1,648,000,000</p>
<p>Other Countries | 1,008,000,000</p>
<p>Under the heading of the other ten countries, the amount is quite small, but the eight countries from Romania upwards (excluding Russia) actually bear 96% of the total war debt, while the UK, France, and Italy are the three largest debtors. Russia is not included because it has not yet indicated any intention to repay its debt.</p>
<p>As for the use of all war debts, according to the reports submitted by each debtor country to the U.S. Treasury Department, the allocation is as follows (in millions of gold dollars):</p>
<p>War Supplies                 2,698</p>
<p>Cotton and Exchange           2,645</p>
<p>Grains                      1,422</p>
<p>Other Foodstuffs            1,630</p>
<p>Cigarettes                  145</p>
<p>Other Provisions            613</p>
<p>Transportation              309</p>
<p>Interest, etc.               1,379</p>
<p>Relief Work                  538</p>
<p>Other                       489</p>
<p>Total                        11,868</p>
<p>The items listed in the table were all used in the United States, but the total is about 10% more than the total in the table above, which proves that the debtor countries also used funds obtained from other sources in the United States.  Generally, the loans taken out by the countries were mostly for American goods, and each country purchased more than necessary.</p>
<p>The debt repayment plans of each country took about eight or nine years (1922 to 1930) to be successfully agreed upon. The agreement stipulated that the debt period was 62 years, and the interest rate varied according to the repayment ability of each country. The following table details the war debt principal (including interest up to the time the agreement was established), the interest rate percentage, and the total principal and interest that each debtor country acknowledged to repay (in millions of gold dollars, see Figure 2):</p>
<p>Country              Principal     Interest Rate     Total Principal and Interest to be Repaid</p>
<p>British Empire        4,600              3.306               11,105</p>
<p>France                 4,025              1.640                6,848</p>

<p>Czechoslovakia        115                3.327                313</p>
<p>Yugoslavia            63                 1.030                95</p>
<p>Romania                45                 3.321                123</p>
<p>Total                 11,565                               22,188</p>
<p>The total amount to be repaid in this table is twice the original amount borrowed, meaning that for every dollar borrowed, two dollars must be repaid.</p>
<p>Diagram of Total War Debt Principal and Interest (Figure 2)</p>
<p>(Principal 11,565,000,000 Interest 10,623,000,000)</p>

<p>Italy | 2,408,000,000</p>
<p>Other Countries | 1,829,000,000</p>
<p>The amount already repaid by each debtor country is far from the amount that should be repaid. The following table (in millions of gold dollars) can be compared with the table above for details:</p>
<p>Country              Amount Already Repaid</p>
<p>British Empire         1,912</p>

<p>Czechoslovakia        18</p>
<p>Yugoslavia            2</p>
<p>Romania                5</p>
<p>Other                  32</p>
<p>Total                  2,628</p>
<p>Diagram of War Debts Already Repaid (Figure 3)</p>
<p>(Principal 0,726,000,000  Interest 1,920,000,000)</p>
<p>2,628,000,000</p>

<p>UK | 1,912,000,000</p>
<p>France | 486,000,000</p>
<p>Italy | 198,000,000</p>
<p>Other Countries | 132,000,000</p>
<p>From this table, it can be seen that the amount repaid by each country to date is only about one-quarter of the war debt principal. It would be closer to the truth to say that it is repayment of interest rather than repayment of debt.</p>
<p>Currently, the issue of modifying war debts has sparked fierce debate in the United States. The arguments for and against it are nothing more than the following theoretical and practical opinions:</p>
<p>In theory, opponents of the modification say that: (1) One-quarter of the $11,565,000,000 of war debt was loaned to European countries after the peace treaty was signed. This amount was not used for war, but for the internal reconstruction of each country. (2) The original interest rate stated in each country's loan note was 5%. Now the United States has been lenient and reduced the average interest rate to 2.135%, so the sacrifice of the United States has been very significant. (3) The budgets of each debtor country for expanding military equipment in recent years far exceed the debt repayment budget, so they are not without the ability to repay the debt. Therefore, the United States should never make further concessions and re-sign the war debt agreement.</p>
<p>Those who support the modification argue as follows: (1) Although the debts that the United States loaned to European countries after the peace treaty were used for the internal construction of each country, the motive was that the United States wanted to maintain the purchasing power of each country in the United States in order to prevent the early arrival of an economic panic in the United States. If it were not for Hoover's suggestion to the U.S. government on this matter, the United States would probably no longer lend to other countries. (2) Although the average war debt interest rate is 2.135%, it is not low. (3) Even if each country does not expand its military equipment, it will have no surplus capacity to repay the war debt, because the current military equipment of each country is purchased on credit within its own country. (4) When the United States loaned money to each country in the past, it did not lend cash, but lent American goods at the highest prices. After the war, prices fell sharply, and each country unknowingly bore an increased burden, and the value of each country's currency also plummeted, further increasing the U.S. debt claims unknowingly. What sacrifice has the United States made? Therefore, the United States should theoretically modify the war debt agreement to reduce the unbearable burden of each debtor country.</p>
<p>In terms of practical opinions, there are the following two points: (1) From Wilson to the present, the U.S. authorities have all declared that war debts and reparations are two completely unrelated international transactions. Opponents of the modification now hold the same view. Supporters of the modification say that although these two items are not a single account in law, they cannot be separated in practice. When the victorious countries demanded reparations in the beginning, they intended to use them to offset war debts. Later, the Young Plan and the Dawes Plan all used war debts as a reference. Even the Lausanne Reparations Conference never failed to use war debts as a standard. Hoover's suspension of war debt repayments for one year because Germany was unable to pay reparations made the close relationship between the two even more obvious. Since then, Germany's ability to pay reparations is even more hopeless, so it is necessary to finally modify the war debts. (2) International trade is now declining, mainly due to the global economic depression caused by the European War. To save this panic, it is necessary to work hard on the two issues of reparations and war debts. If the United States is willing to reduce the burden of each country, the world economy can be expected to recover, and the United States' foreign trade, especially trade with Europe, can naturally increase sharply. The gains of the people and the government's income each year can be more than the war debts repaid by each country. Why be so fixated on the repayment of war debts? This is the opinion of those who support the modification. However, opponents say that the total amount of debt repaid by each country last year was only one-quarter of the total amount purchased from the United States, so each country has not reduced its purchasing power due to repaying war debts.

<h3>The Northeast Problem and the League of Nations (10)</h3>
<p>"The Japanese representative has submitted to the Executive Yuan the Japanese government's statement regarding the League of Nations Inquiry Commission's report. The Japanese government believes that the entire report, especially the factual part, is a valuable description of the Manchurian Incident. In many sections and even the entire report, the Japanese government completely agrees. The Japanese government is extremely grateful for the sincere and hard work of the Inquiry Commission and expresses its gratitude to the entire Inquiry Commission and its members. However, for the sake of honesty, the Japanese government deeply believes that if the Inquiry Commission could conduct a longer study of this incident, its inferences and conclusions in the report would be more complete and appropriate. Therefore, the Japanese government has made every effort to draft a statement to point out the contents of the report, and it is hoped that the members of the Executive Yuan can give it careful consideration and judgment. The report contains a lengthy description of the current situation in China, but Japan cannot agree with its optimistic and hopeful attitude. At the time of the Washington Conference in 1922, although the situation in China was not entirely satisfactory, Japan was still able to follow other powers in hoping that China could restore peace and unity as soon as possible. Although the situation at that time was worse than at the beginning of the Republic of China ten years ago, we still had expectations of progress. Today, ten years have passed easily, and China's situation not only has not progressed, but is even worse than in 1922. In all parts of China, we can see the forces of warlords seizing power. Outer Mongolia has been communized, Tibet is fighting against the central government, and Turkestan is completely isolated from nominal China. The National Government only controls a few provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River with military force. Shandong is experiencing internal warfare, Sichuan is in chaos, and the Guangdong faction expresses an aloof and even hostile attitude towards the government. In addition, there is another dangerous plot, as mentioned in the report, which is the threat of communism. China did not have this threat at the time of the Washington Conference. It entered China in 1925, when the revolutionary leader Dr. Sun Yat-sen carried out the revolutionary movement with the help of Soviet Russian military supplies, money, and military propaganda experts. After the death of Dr. Sun, General Chiang Kai-shek rose to be the leader, disagreed with Red Russia, and expelled all Russian personnel from the country. Today, Chiang is still directing the anti-communist military operations in the heartland provinces of China such as Hubei, Fujian, and Jiangxi. However, the Kuomintang and the National Government still have not abandoned the principles that caused the powers to increase their troops stationed in Shanghai a few years ago. The stationing of European, American, and Japanese troops in China and the entry and exit of foreign warships in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been going on for more than 30 years. The purpose of these foreign troops is not only to protect their overseas Chinese, but also to protect their old embassies in Beijing (now Beiping) and the current embassies in Nanjing. May I ask, within a country with a recognized government, do the diplomatic representatives sent by various countries need the protection of troops and warships? Is this not a unique situation in China? Is the stationing of foreign troops in China merely a formality? The gentlemen should still remember the attack on the consulates of various countries in Nanjing by troops belonging to the National Revolutionary Army in 1927. Since then, conflicts between foreign troops and Chinese troops and bandits have occurred from time to time. Under normal circumstances, the Japanese government's troops and warships stationed in China are not more than those of the British or American governments. However, the number of Japanese nationals in China is several times greater than the total number of nationals of other countries. Therefore, the Japanese government has made every effort to reduce its troop deployments in China. After the Kuomintang adopted a radical policy, the friendship between China and the powers did not advance towards friendliness. The report stated that "Because of the adoption of violent anti-foreign propaganda, it has been hindered, and it has been carried out wantonly in two special places, which has helped to create the current conflict situation. This is the use of economic boycotts and the intervention of anti-foreign propaganda in schools." It also stated that "Dr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine is taught in all schools, and its authority is equal to that of the Confucian classics in the previous century. Dr. Sun's speeches are respected no differently from Confucius before the revolution. However, unfortunately, in the education of young people, the construction of nationalism seems to receive more attention than its destructive aspects. A flip through the textbooks of various schools will make the reader feel that the author intends to use the flames of jealousy to ignite patriotism, and wants to build personality on the psychology of hatred. This kind of violent anti-foreign propaganda initially started in schools, and then applied to all aspects of social life. As a result, it lures students to participate in political activities, and sometimes even leads to attacks on the bodies, homes, or government offices of various ministers and other officials, and attempts to overthrow the government." The Chinese National Government is deeply imbued with anti-foreign sentiment, and is making every effort to instill xenophobia into the minds of young people. Fifty million young Chinese have now been affected by radical ideas, which will inevitably create the most terrible problems in the future. The Chinese army has reached 2 million people, but only a very small number of them are well-organized and able to protect the country. The Chinese government also has a method of resistance that is different from armed resistance, namely the boycott movement. This movement is actually a hostile act that violates commercial and friendship treaties, and the result is worse than open warfare. Japanese nationals in China have endured this kind of pain for several years. Sometimes, due to economic oppression, they have even reduced the number of meals per day, and countless people have gone bankrupt as a result. This movement is not a natural movement of the Chinese people, but is promoted and organized by the Chinese Kuomintang and the National Government as a national policy to force foreign countries to give up their treaty rights. The countries of the world have recognized war as illegal. Then, why can't boycott movements, whether formal or informal, be regarded as illegal acts? Besides Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States are also affected by China's economic boycotts, but Japan suffers the most. The more tolerant Japan is towards the Chinese government, the more obvious and deep the hostility it receives. However, the Japanese government has no hatred for the Chinese people. The above points refer to the general situation in China. Now let's focus on Manchuria. Before Zhang Zuolin's death in 1928, there was no such economic severance movement in Manchuria. After Zhang Xueliang joined hands with the National Government, staff from mainland China went to Manchuria one after another to carry out anti-Japanese propaganda, claiming that Japan's interests in Manchuria should be recovered one by one, and that all the investments Japan had made in railways, mines, and other undertakings should belong to China. All kinds of propaganda pamphlets, posters, speeches, etc., emerged endlessly. Even Zhang Xueliang's 300,000 troops were swayed by this kind of thought. However, Japan has repeatedly stated that it will never give up its various rights and properties in Manchuria, and has formally warned Zhang Xueliang and declared to the world that Manchuria is of extreme importance to Japan in terms of its position and economy, so it cannot tolerate any changes in its special status there. However, Japan has no other intentions other than protecting its property and rights stipulated in the treaty, and is willing to recognize China's nominal national rights, and will do its utmost to maintain the open door and equal opportunity principles of international policy. Japan's patience can be said to have reached its limit, but it was not Japan's fault that the final split occurred. The September 18th Incident last year was just a phenomenon of patience reaching its extreme and finally breaking. The report stated that the bombing of the South Manchurian Railway tracks was not sufficient reason for military action. The bombing of the tracks, in itself, is a small point, but the background must be noted. If this incident did not occur on the night of September 18th and on another day, the Inquiry Commission's opinion could be considered correct. However, the existence of the facts is not so simple, and the tension of the situation and the excitement of emotions at that time must not be ignored. After the incident, the speed of the Japanese army's actions may seem strange to those who do not know the situation. In fact, Japan must have prepared for the crisis in order to deal with it. Therefore, Japan cannot agree with the point in the report that the military action taken by the Japanese army on the night of September 18th cannot be regarded as legitimate self-defense. In the memorandum of the U.S. Secretary of State Kellogg on June 23, 1928, regarding the right of self-defense, it was stated that the right of self-defense should be enjoyed by any country and is implied in any treaty. When the U.S. Senate passed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, it made a resolution stating that "The right of a country to use military force for self-defense may sometimes extend beyond the country's borders." In addition, British Foreign Secretary Chamberlain also stated in letters dated May 19 and July 18, 1928, that there are several places in the world whose safety is of special importance to the United Kingdom. Therefore, the British government cannot but declare that the British government cannot tolerate external interference in these places, and that protecting these places from foreign attacks is a method of self-defense for the British Empire. It was also stated that the meaning of the Kellogg-Briand Pact should be based on not restricting or impairing a country's right to self-defense. In addition, the French and German governments have made similar statements. The Japanese government also stated in a memorandum to the U.S. ambassador to Japan on May 26, 1928, that the U.S. government's proposal also recognizes that it does not include the denial of the right of independent countries to self-defense. Based on the above reservations, the Japanese government believes that the Japanese army's actions on September 18th were entirely out of self-defense and there is no doubt. Then why did Japan not submit the Manchurian Incident to the League of Nations for resolution? Japan's reasons are: (1) Japan's national sentiment cannot allow the Manchurian issue to be subject to external interference. (2) The League of Nations' actions are extremely slow. If the League of Nations resolves the issue, the suffering of Japanese nationals in Manchuria, including Korean nationals, will be incalculable. (3) There are points of psychological difference between Japan and the West. (4) The arrival of the September 18th Incident was unexpected. After it broke out, it was in a situation that could not be left to its own devices. As for the various points in the report regarding Manchuria, there are many that the Japanese government cannot agree to. The report stated that Manchuria is a part of China. In fact, Manchuria is only the private property of a royal family, and it still belonged to Manchuria until the beginning of this century. The Chinese government's administrative power has never actually reached Manchuria. This point has been detailed in the Japanese government's statement. The Inquiry Commission stated that restoring Manchuria to its original state cannot be considered a satisfactory solution. Japan completely agrees with this point. However, it absolutely cannot agree with the point that maintaining and recognizing Manchukuo cannot be considered satisfactory. We believe that the creation of Manchukuo is the only satisfactory solution to this case. If this is abandoned, the Far East incident will only tend to be more chaotic. The Inquiry Commission expressed doubts about the authenticity of the Manchurian independence movement. In fact, the organization of Manchukuo was not due to Japan's direction, but to the local people's aversion to chaos. The officials of Manchukuo are all well-known local figures. Therefore, the so-called lack of an independence movement before September 18th is not a fact. As for the instructions that Japanese military and civil officials must not participate in the new organization of Manchuria, they were indeed telegraphed to be followed by Foreign Minister Shidehara and Army Minister Minami on September 26th. The Inquiry Commission expressed optimism about the future of mainland China, but pessimism about the future of Manchukuo. Japan's opinion is the opposite. Although the establishment of Manchukuo has not exceeded eleven months, its achievements are already considerable. Since the collapse of the Qing government 20 years ago, Manchukuo has actually been the first civil governance organization in the region. If the new government did not have the presence of the Japanese army, it would be difficult to establish. But may I ask, if the Chinese National Government did not have the support of guns, weapons, and foreign personnel, could it exist in Nanjing? As for the various progress of Manchukuo, the Japanese government's statement has described it in detail, such as the increasing stability of the value of the central bank's currency, which is its most important aspect. As for the bandit suppression work, it has not yet been completely successful, but if it is given time, it will eventually be cleared. In short, Japan cannot be held responsible for the Manchurian Incident. Japan did not pursue such events, and if all of China or Manchuria could have a suitable government so that Japanese nationals could live and work in peace, these events would probably not have occurred. Japan is only taking natural action for self-defense, and the independence movement in Manchuria after Japan's action also naturally followed. The Japanese government's policies, hopes, and determination are all based on the four words of maintaining peace. Japan does not want to fight with any country, nor does it want any country's territory. Japan is not an aggressor. Japan sincerely cares about China's happiness. For decades, China's unfortunate situation has been a dangerous force for the world's future, and Japan's policies are actually sufficient to consolidate peace in the Far East. If the Western countries actually make contrary comments about Japan, then the reasons are something that Japan cannot understand."</p>
<p>Geneva has been very gloomy for several days, with rare glimpses of sunlight. On the evening of the Executive Yuan's meeting, there was heavy rain and biting cold winds, as if heaven was also expressing concern for the future of peace. (The End) (Sent from Geneva on November 21)</p>
<h3>Burning of the Xiamen Siming Court</h3>
<p>Sudden Fire in the Chief Judge's Office</p>
<p>Greatest Loss of Civil and Criminal Cases</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: A major fire suddenly broke out at the Xiamen Siming District Court on the 18th, turning the entire magnificent building into rubble. Most of the court's files were also reduced to ashes. The Siming District Court building was constructed with three sections, each with two floors. The front building housed the High Court branch offices, the middle building contained the District Prosecutor's Office, the High Court Chief Judge's Office, the High Court Chief Clerk's Office, and the Records Office. The rear building housed the District Court Chief Judge's Office and the offices. The 18th was a Sunday, and most of the court staff were off duty as usual, with only a duty prosecutor and bailiffs remaining. Unexpectedly, at 2:40 PM, a fire suddenly broke out in the Chief Judge Chen Fuchang's office in the rear building. The rooms were all separated by wooden partitions, causing the fire to quickly spread to the roof and then to the middle building. The bailiffs on the lower floor, upon seeing the situation, shouted for help and reported to various fire brigades by telephone. Some went up to the middle building to move down the High Court files, while others struggled to move their personal belongings. However, due to the intensity of the fire, some of the High Court files could not be moved out and were burned. Some say the cause of the fire was a short circuit in the Chief Judge's office, but this matter is of great importance and cannot be confirmed without sufficient evidence. Soon, the Xiamen fire brigade, the Public Security Bureau, and various water dragons (firefighting pumps) rushed to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire. However, water was difficult to obtain there, causing the fire to spread to the front building. The fire brigades then quickly dismantled the firebreaks behind and on either side of the court and the neighboring buildings, and worked hard to carry water to extinguish the fire. Amidst the chaos, the heads of the four offices, the Public Security Bureau Chief Lin Zhencheng, and others led teams to the scene to direct everything. Second Company, Third Platoon Leader Huang Guangcan and others led four platoons of soldiers to guard the county government and Siming Prison, one platoon to guard the Boji Hospital, to prevent any unexpected events. The remaining platoon stood guard at both ends of the road, preventing idlers from entering the fire scene, so the order was not disrupted. When the fire first started, the flames soared into the sky. After being extinguished by the fire brigades, it was finally put out at 5:30 PM. High Court Chief Judge Wang Tingyi, Chief Prosecutor Chen Baozhu (Chen Bao Yu), Prosecutor Ouyang Han, Chen Xiaoshi, and others arrived after hearing the news, stood on the road watching the fire, and inspected the files abandoned on the roadside, bowing their heads in silence. It was finally discovered that the fire started in Chief Judge Chen's office in the rear building. Chen's servant Wei Qichang (from Fuzhou) and a Cantonese man (also Chen's servant, name unknown) were taken into custody. Later, bailiff Zheng Shihui and two others were also taken to the county government for investigation. At 6:00 PM, the fire brigades saw that the fire had been extinguished and returned to their respective teams. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 PM, the fire reignited because the embers in the building had not been completely extinguished, so the fire brigades rushed back again and extinguished it at around 10:00 PM. The court building had completely turned into a rubble field. In terms of losses, in addition to the entire court building being burned down and neighboring buildings being dismantled, the personal belongings of the staff were difficult to investigate. It was also heard that all the files of the District Court were destroyed in the fire, and the property deeds of the merchants and residents that were registered with the court were also burned. Now that the court has been burned down, the staff have no place to stay, so they are temporarily staying at the Wuzhou Hotel or friends' homes.</p>
<p>It is also reported that in this fire at the Siming Court, the High Court, being separated by a building, suffered the least loss. The District Court Prosecutor's Office and the place where the fire started were in the same row and were wooden buildings, so there was no way to save them. Only a few execution cases and ongoing cases from the clerk's office were rescued from the fire. The District Court had no losses in the general affairs and accounting sections of the court, but no civil or criminal cases were spared. The loss in civil cases is not counted. Fortunately, the registry was outside and was preserved. On the 20th, the District Prosecutor's Office began working temporarily at the nearby Ziyang School, and the High Court began working at the Siming County Government. It is unlikely that the High Court will find a new location temporarily. The District Court Prosecutor's Office is looking for a place to rent a house to work behind the Fourth Police Station.

<h3>The Third Day of the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly</h3>
<p>The third Jiangsu Provincial Representatives' Conference was originally scheduled to hold its first formal meeting this morning (the 27th), but because the number of representatives present did not reach the legal quorum, it was changed to 3:00 PM in the afternoon. There were 126 representatives present. The chairman was Gu Ziyang. After the ceremony, Gu Zhutong first reported on the important work of the provincial government over the past year. After the report, Chen Dangyi, a representative from Tongshan County, stood up to question the establishment of a drug investigation office and the opium monopoly. Other representatives also stood up to ask questions. After Gu Zhutong took the stage twice to explain, he said that the establishment of the drug investigation office was solely responsible for investigating drugs and that there was no opium monopoly. He also said that he cherished the past revolutionary history and did not want this kind of incident to happen. Next, Zhao Qilu, the head of the Department of Civil Affairs, and others reported on their work in turn, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Court Service of Judgments in the Songjiang Bank Case</h3>
<p>Creditors Will File an Appeal</p>
<p>After some creditors in the Songjiang Bank bankruptcy case entrusted lawyers Qu and Liu to file a civil payment lawsuit, the county court summoned them six times. The debate ended on December 6, and the public notice was announced on the 12th. The creditors believed that there were doubts and applied for an explanation, but no ruling was received. Yesterday (the 26th), Bai Guanlan and others received the county court's ruling. It is said that an appeal will be filed. The main text and reasons for the ruling are recorded below: "Main text" The plaintiff's lawsuit against the defendants Zhu Hesun and Gu Jiaxuan is requested to be withdrawn. The rest is deemed withdrawn. The plaintiff bears the litigation costs. "Reasons" The subject matter of the lawsuit must be determined jointly for each person in a joint lawsuit. If the other party's actions against one of the joint litigants are the same as those against the entire group, this is clearly stipulated in Article 53, Section 2 of the Civil Procedure Law. The so-called must be determined jointly means that the majority of private law relationships in substantive law maintain the same state for each joint litigant. Therefore, the other party's actions against one of the joint litigants should be regarded as the same as those against the entire group, in order to achieve this purpose of joint determination. In this case, the plaintiff stated that although Songjiang Bank adopted the form of a company, with directors, supervisors, presidents, managers, and treasurers, it was actually a partnership shop. The defendants shared the above-mentioned positions, or handled affairs on a regular basis, or participated in meetings. In essence, they were shareholders and important employees who performed duties. The bank suddenly declared a cessation of business and maliciously owed huge sums of money. The plaintiffs were either savings, deposits, or had excess transactions. They were all hard-earned money and necessary for life. Xie Liangda fled and could not be seen, so a public notice should be served. However, this case urgently needs to proceed. According to the company's regulations, directors and supervisors are all important employees and bear full responsibility. It is proposed to advance the trial, etc., and request joint compensation for debts. All the defendants Zhang Xiaomei and others are constituent elements of Songjiang Bank. The reasons for the lawsuit are the same in fact and in law. Regardless of whether the nature of Songjiang Bank is a company or a partnership, the defendants should be jointly responsible (Articles 28 and 681 of the Civil Code). It is necessary to maintain the same state in substance. Therefore, the defendant's lawsuit is an indivisible joint lawsuit. The plaintiff is an integral part of it. The plaintiff's withdrawal of the lawsuit against the defendants Zhu Hesun and Gu Jiaxuan (directors and supervisors) during the verbal debate should be regarded as a withdrawal against the entire group. However, the plaintiff's legal establishment of the creditor's rights will not be affected by the declaration of this ruling, and the substantive rights will not be affected. Combined explanation, based on the above conclusion, a ruling should be made in accordance with Article 12 of the Implementation Law of the Civil Procedure Law and Article 85, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Procedure Law, as in the main text.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Anti-Japanese Association Intercepts a Large Batch of Enemy Cloth</h3>
<p>After the Northeast Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps came to Suzhou, their work became quite tense. Although the shops did not dare to openly sell enemy goods, they still smuggled them into Suzhou. The Anti-Japanese Association received a tip that a large batch of enemy goods was being transported to Suzhou for sale. The association sent personnel to various water and land terminals to check. That night, at the intersection of Loumen Baihe Lane, they intercepted two large carts of Yanghe brand white twill enemy cloth secretly transported by Jiufeng Foreign Goods Store on Lindun Road, totaling forty bolts. The carts were sealed and stored by the Anti-Japanese Association for a scheduled meeting to punish the treacherous merchants and serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Robbery Occurs in Shenjia Village, Wuxi</h3>
<p>In Shenjia Village, District 15, Tu 82, in the county, there is a Shen Hanchu family who are fairly well-off. His son works in a hardware store in Shanghai. He returned to his hometown the day before yesterday, carrying 500 silver dollars to prepare to buy farmland. Unexpectedly, the bandits found out about it and suddenly came to rob last night. In addition to being robbed of 500 silver dollars, there were also two gold rings, two pairs of gold bracelets, and two coats, totaling more than 700 silver dollars in losses. In Zhang Xiaolong's home in Xiaozhang Lane, District 3, the villagers received 200 silver dollars in savings the day before yesterday, which the bandits learned about. At about 2:00 AM last night, six or seven bandits robbed the house, taking two gold-inlaid gemstone rings, a pair of gold bracelets, five silver dollars, and six or seven pieces of clothing, totaling more than 200 silver dollars in losses.</p>
<h3>Deng Qingyang Visits Wuxi</h3>
<p>Deng Qingyang, a Central Alternate Supervisory Committee member, was recommended by the Southwest Executive Department to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Nanjing with three Central Committee members, Guan Suiren, Li Qian, and Cui Guangxiu. After the plenary session closed, Deng stayed in Nanjing for several days. He had long admired the beautiful mountains and rivers of Wuxi, so he took a train to Wuxi with his wife, Ms. He, the day before yesterday to visit the Huishan Temple scenic spot. It is said that Mr. and Mrs. Deng plan to stay in Wuxi for three or four days, and then take a train to Shanghai to return south.</p>
<h3>Jiading Police and Militia Arrest Five Thieves</h3>
<p>The other day, Chen Jinsheng, a farmer from Xishenjia Stone Bridge, Zhensheng Hall, wanted to buy the farmland next to his house and borrowed silver dollars from others. The nearby bandits Lu Jinsheng and others learned about it and took advantage of the fact that the money had been borrowed but not yet paid. They ganged up and went to rob, losing more than 100 silver dollars in cash, dozens of dollars worth of jewelry and clothing, etc. After the report was made to the county government for arrest, Wang Bingxun, the director of the Nanxiang Public Security Bureau, and Cheng Hanmin, the head of the Second District Militia, arrested five thieves, Chang Jinsheng, Wang Ayun, Wang Bingsheng, Zhu Xiaodi, and Wang Jinsheng, in Dahu and sent them to the county for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Bandits Rob and Injure People on the Road</h3>
<p>Dai Wenliang, from Pengmen Village outside the West Gate, was working as a clerk in Xu Tongyuan's rice shop in Waigang. On the 25th, he collected payment for goods at the Dalong Shop in Jiading. It was near dusk when he returned via Liuliting. Four bandits blocked his way, wielding sharp knives and stabbing Dai several times. Dai fainted immediately, and all the 400 silver dollars he had were robbed. Dai woke up several hours later and called for help, but the bandits were gone.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Provincial Representatives Re-elected</h3>
<p>The Jiangyin provincial representative election had previously been disrupted by disputes. The election ballots were taken to the province by the supervising election official Huang Renyan for counting, and the Provincial Executive Committee and the Central Special Preparatory Committee decided to announce the elected candidates, Chen Lan, Chen Xiping, Xue Chan, and Xu Jiang. Subsequently, the party members in various districts of the county repeatedly submitted reports to the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Central Government, accusing them of election fraud. The Central Government ordered the province to punish the corrupt personnel separately. On the 23rd, the Provincial Party Headquarters received another telegram from the Central Government regarding the Jiangyin provincial representatives who had been elected, canceling all of them and holding a new election. The three preparatory members of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Ye Zheng and Ni, after receiving the telegram, immediately held a meeting at 11:00 PM that night and decided to send Wu Shusheng, a staff member of the Provincial Supervisory Committee, to Yinhang to supervise. However, the Provincial Representatives' Conference had already opened on the 25th, and the session was very short. Today (the 25th), the Jiangyin Party has quickly elected them.</p>
<h3>Nantong Public Security Branch Deliberates on Abolition</h3>
<p>The Nantong County Administrative Conference decided to abolish all district public security branches. The public security in the four villages is maintained by the militia. The county government submitted a report to the province for approval, ordering that the existing district branches be investigated and listed for reporting, and that the distribution of public security mu donations be re-determined and submitted to the province for approval. The local public group is preparing plans for the aftermath.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Jinsheng Money Shop Suddenly Runs Aground</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Jinsheng Money Shop has been open for more than 30 years and has a good reputation. The initial capital was only 500 yuan, but today it has exceeded one million. Last year, the public reserve fund reached hundreds of thousands of yuan. Business is usually very prosperous, and there are exchanges with both local and foreign shops, large and small. Loans have reached more than one million. Recently, due to the impact of the current situation, it has been difficult to recover them in a short time. Yesterday, a certain Jia applied to Liu Jinsheng Shop in Yuankangzhuang for 2,000 yuan, but Yuankang refused. The news spread, and depositors rushed to Jinsheng to withdraw money, making it impossible to cope with. The shop has already telegraphed Manager Zhang Ziliang to Zhenjiang to handle the matter. Nanjing Jinhe Shop also declared bankruptcy due to being implicated. It is said that the actual deposits in the shop are only more than 600,000, and after offsetting the two, there are still several hundred thousand. How to deal with the aftermath must wait for Zhang's return to the province to decide.</p>
<h3>Two Robberies in Changshu in One Night</h3>
<p>Nanhengjing, near Pingshu in District 14 of the county, is a small town with few residents and no defenses, so it is easy for bandits to mix in. At about 12:00 AM the night before last (the 24th), more than a dozen bandits suddenly arrived in the town to rob. At that time, the residents of the town were asleep. The bandits first went to Xu Lian's house to rob, losing a pair of gold bracelets and more than 50 silver dollars, as well as clothing, etc. Then the bandits went to the homes of Xu Guisen, Yang Arong, and others one after another to search and rob, and the losses were also considerable, totaling no less than a thousand silver dollars. In Baiai Township, District 10, at about 1:00 AM on the 24th, five or six bandits landed on the shore from the Baiyuankou River and went directly to the home of Deputy Township Chief Lu Fenglan, broke into the house, searched and robbed for an hour before escaping. They were robbed of 122 silver dollars in banknotes, 42 silver dollars in cash, 12,000 copper coins, and more than 20 pieces of single-layer and cotton clothing. Afterwards, people were sent to report to the police teams in Zhoushi and Wushi. By the time the police arrived, the bandits were gone.</p>

<h3>Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Radio Broadcast</h3>
<p>All Compatriots Throughout the Country, Help the Northeast Volunteers</p>
<p>A Mandatory Donation of One Copper Coin Per Person Per Day</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:20 AM, the Northeast Refugee Relief Association specially arranged for Mr. Ma Xiangbo to broadcast a radio speech to help the Northeast Volunteers. The Ya Mei Company specially installed equipment at Mr. Ma's residence in Xujiahui. The sound was very clear at that time, and his speech was very touching. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>Everyone, it's getting late, wake up. It has been a full year and three months since the September 18th Incident last year. When the Japanese government launched the incident, it expected that China had no ability to resist and could easily take it in one go. The formal army was indeed what they expected. But they never expected that the people of the Northeast would rise up to resist on their own. They may have expected that, like when they annexed Korea before, they would only need to mobilize a small number of troops and it would be pacified in two or three months at most. They never expected that fifteen months later, the people's resistance not only did not decrease, but increased and expanded compared to before. This is really something they did not expect. However, everyone, we should not be happy about this, let alone take pride in it. Why is it not enough to be happy about? Because when the incident occurred, the Japanese army was somewhat contemptuous of the enemy. They regarded our Northeast Volunteers as bandits, thinking that they would not be defeated in one battle. Since these fifteen months, they have not only not gained any advantage, but have often failed. Their attitude towards the volunteers has changed to very serious, and their methods have become more vicious. They are now using their superior weapons and openly violating international conventions, using poison gas. They used to only want to threaten the people of the Northeast, but now they want to eliminate them. Therefore, the more the Japanese army cannot gain an advantage in the Northeast, the greater the danger of the Northeast Volunteers' future. How can we be complacent about small victories? Why is it not enough to be proud of? Everyone, think about it. The three words "non-resistance" lightly gave away thousands of miles of territory. If it were not for the people of the Northeast, the farmers, workers, and merchants, who rose up to save themselves, the three northeastern provinces would have become the second Korea long ago. Who is the glory of this fifteen months of arduous struggle? The Shenbao of the 23rd of this month published a piece of news about the volunteers. It is said that Feng Zhanhai's troops had no choice but to retreat westward because they ran out of ammunition and supplies. When crossing the river, the families of the officers and soldiers at all levels were unable to escape back to Guan Nei beforehand. It was inconvenient to take them with them, and they were afraid that they would be trampled on by the Japanese if they were left behind. Speaking of a very painful thing, there were even those who killed their wives before leaving. Everyone, who doesn't have a wife? Killing their wives for no reason, for what? Yesterday's newspaper also said that the volunteers mostly slept in the wild, without clothes to keep out the cold. Everyone wrapped some firewood or carried a saddle. Without food, they could only fill their stomachs with grass roots and tree bark. Everyone, who is this for? Can we still be safe and sound if they all die? After the three northeastern provinces are lost, can Guan Nei still be as stable as Mount Tai? Therefore, when I read the news about the volunteers in the newspaper, I feel that now Japan is using the power of the whole country to eliminate the volunteers. If the volunteers do not receive a steady stream of supplies, they will definitely be eliminated. At the same time, I feel that the people of the Northeast are eating their own food and risking their own property and lives to fight for these thousands of miles of territory for the country. Now they are using their flesh and blood to block the artillery fire, and even their food and clothing are not sufficient. Are we still living in peace and enjoying ourselves? How can we be worthy of them? Looking back at Japan over the decades, they have been painstakingly calculating China. Since the September 18th Incident, although they have encountered an extreme economic panic, they are still united and dealing with the current difficult situation. Compared with our numb attitude, there is really nothing to say. Is China really going to perish? Therefore, we have only two feelings for the volunteers, namely "fear" and "shame." If we want to get rid of "fear," we must do our best to help them. They exist. One day, the Republic of China will not perish for one day. If we do our best to help the volunteers, we will fulfill a share of the responsibility of saving the country and reduce a share of the guilt in our conscience. I think the easiest way is for us to start today, no matter who, regardless of age or gender, to save one copper coin every day, and then hand it over to the place that receives donations after accumulating a whole number. Everyone, on the road or at the door of your house, which day and where do you not spend two more copper coins? When you meet a beggar, you still throw a copper coin to him. The Northeast Volunteers who are wrapped in firewood and eat grass roots and tree bark cannot be compared to disaster victims and beggars. Donating to charity is still worth ten or eight yuan, but one copper coin a day, shouldn't it be worth it? I personally have made up my mind to do this. Although I am old, one year is more than a block of money. Everyone is of course much younger than me, and of course will accumulate more than me. If everyone can do this, we will have no use for "panic" and "shame." (The old man paused here and continued),</p>
<p>Everyone, wake up. If there is gunpowder next to the pillow, can we sleep? If there is a small thief in the house, can we sleep? Japan has accumulated decades of ambition and attempts to poison us, to occupy our territory, not only the three northeastern provinces, not only the Yangtze River area, half of the country is full of spies, and there are even accomplices to help him. Only the Northeast Volunteers are worthy of world justice. Think about it, the traitors who "eat human flesh on the land" can still make absurd arguments on the League of Nations seat. Does the world still have "humanity" and "human heart" justice? The people of Jiangsu and the people of Shanghai were able to bravely resist Japan with the 19th Route Army when the planes were overhead and the flames of war were on the ground, fighting for the country's personality. Now the whole country should help the Northeast Volunteers and preserve justice for the world. I hope that parents will lead the family, shopkeepers will lead the employees, factory owners will lead the factory workers, and various groups will implement the national mandatory donation of "one copper coin per person per day" from today. First, it shows the spirit of national cooperation and facing national disasters together with the Northeast Volunteers. Second, it proves that our country is unyielding, because one copper coin per person per day is 470 million per day. If we use the same spirit to strive for self-reliance, then Japan's ambitions for aggression will eventually fail. In short, this start of not forgetting to save the country every day and everyone helping the Northeast's daily donation movement means that we all have a conscience, have the ability, and that the whole country, all sectors, unite and strive for survival, defend ourselves for humanitarianism, and will eventually have a day to recover the lost territory of the Northeast.</p>

<h3>Various Sectors Telegraph Tang Yulin</h3>
<p>The Third District Party Headquarters telegraphed Tang Yulin yesterday, saying: 𤍠 He, Chairman Tang, may I extend my respects. Since the violent sun occupied the Northeast, fortunately our loyal and courageous volunteers have fought bitterly with the strong enemy for years. The sound of their bravery has spread far and wide in the international arena, and the world has been impressed. It has shown the world that China cannot be bullied and made the Japanese bandits wary. This is the time when our people are determined to overcome all the difficulties and try to resist tyranny. Unexpectedly, in recent days, according to the news reports, the violent sun's ambition has not diminished, and heavy troops are advancing to spy on the border. The news has caused us to grind our teeth in anger. The situation is more dangerous and critical than in the past. The survival of the 𤍠 province, which protects North China, concerns the whole country. The gains and losses, advantages and disadvantages, are well known to you. Moreover, we have repeatedly heard the telegrams, and we admire your early determination to resist foreign aggression and save the country. However, in this urgent and dangerous situation, no delay is allowed. Therefore, we telegraphically request that you mobilize a large army to resist to the death as soon as possible in order to carry out your original intention and not make the achievements of the three provinces a matter of regret. The survival of the nation depends on it. The comrades in this district are giving their all and are determined to provide support. I am anxiously awaiting good news. China National Party, Shanghai Special City, Third District Party Headquarters, gratefully,</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Association telegraphed the 𤍠 He Chairman Tang Yulin yesterday, saying: 𤍠 He, Chairman Tang Yulin, may I extend my respects. The enemy troops are gathering in large numbers and invading the dangerous situation in Hebei, North China. It is extremely dangerous. Your Excellency Chairman is guarding the frontier and bears the heavy responsibility of national defense. I sincerely hope that you will encourage the teachers and soldiers to work hard to kill the enemy, prefer to wipe out the entire army, and not lose an inch of land. As for the needs of the military, our association has been actively raising funds. When the amount is completed, we will separately collect and remit the funds. I hereby report this to you, and I hope you will understand. Shanghai Municipal Education Association, frugally.</p>
<h3>Former US President Roosevelt's Wife Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>External Telegram, Yu Ming et al. Extend Welcome</p>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt, the former First Lady of the United States, along with her son, the current Governor-General of the Philippines, arrived in Shanghai by ship last week, planning to transfer to the Philippines to visit her son. The ship arrived at the port at 7:30 AM yesterday. Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan, having received prior notice of her arrival, immediately telegraphed Yu Ming, the head of the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, instructing him to go to the port to welcome her at the appointed time. Yesterday, Mr. Yu, accompanied by Zhao Tiezhang, the section chief of the Foreign Affairs Office, boarded the ship to present flowers and extend a welcome. After Mrs. Roosevelt disembarked, she attended a tea party at Sun Ke's private residence at 4:00 PM. The US Consul-General in China, Mr. Cunningham, had already left Shanghai, so the acting US Consul, along with the Commercial Counselor and more than twenty prominent figures from Shanghai, accompanied her. At 8:30 PM, she also attended a banquet hosted by the female physician Fei Ai'na, and boarded the original ship at 10:00 PM. Furthermore, Mayor Wu Tiecheng specially dispatched his secretary, Tang Shixuan, to the dock to welcome her and present a flower basket to express his sincerity. Mayor Wu and his wife had originally intended to hold a welcoming reception to fulfill their duty as hosts, but since Mrs. Roosevelt was scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning on the original ship to cross to Manila and visit her eldest son, the current Governor-General of the Philippines, they had to cancel their plans temporarily.</p>

<h3>Banking Association Organizes Clearing House</h3>
<p>Thirty Members Have Joined</p>
<p>The Banking Industry Association, in view of the increasing development of the banking industry and in order to facilitate the collection and settlement of funds among banks, has resolved through a meeting to organize a clearing house. Since the preparation, it has been nearing completion. It has been decided to submit it for discussion at the general meeting of members at 4:00 PM today, with the intention of opening on January 10, 1933. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Preparations Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>The clearing house, after being actively designed and prepared by Zhu Puquan, the manager of the joint preparatory committee of the Banking Industry Association, and others, the clearing house's articles of association have been formally passed. According to Article 3 of the articles of association, all member banks of the association and committee banks of the joint preparatory committee shall join as clearing banks. Other banks or trust companies in Shanghai may join with the introduction of two or more clearing banks and the approval of the committee bank representatives' meeting. As of yesterday's deadline, a total of thirty banks have joined, including twenty-six committee banks such as Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Xingye Bank, Industrial Bank, Zhongfu Bank, and Siming Bank, and four non-committee banks such as the Silk and Satin Industry Bank. As for all preparations, they are nearing completion.</p>
<h3>Address Determined</h3>
<p>The address of the clearing house has been decided to be at No. 4 Hong Kong Road, downstairs in the Banking Association building, the former site of the National Debt Fund Custody Committee. Decoration began the day before yesterday. After the opening in the future, the exchange time will be from 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM for the first time and from 3:20 PM to 3:50 PM for the second time every day, except Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays. On Saturdays, it will be from 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM for the first time and from 3:20 PM to 3:50 PM for the second time. If the balance of the clearing bank's transactions is insufficient to pay, the amount due shall be made up before 4:30 PM on the same day.</p>
<h3>Opening Soon</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Lin Kanghou, the Secretary-General of the Banking Industry Association, yesterday. According to him, Zhu Puquan, the manager of the joint preparatory committee, will concurrently serve as the manager of the clearing house. The opening date is around January 1933, after the New Year's holiday. It must await the decision of the Banking Industry Association's general meeting of members on the 28th. After implementation, it will be very convenient for banks to collect and settle funds. There is no need to settle in cash, only clearing of checks is required. Moreover, various European and American countries have already established them. Now, we are starting with the member banks of this association and the committee banks of the joint preparatory committee. All foreign banks and Chinese money shops can join voluntarily. However, according to reliable information, it has been decided to open on January 10, 1933.</p>
<h3>General Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The Banking Industry Association is scheduled to hold its general meeting of members for the second half of 1932 at 4:00 PM today in the hall at No. 4 Hong Kong Road. In addition to reporting on the work in the second half of the year, the meeting will discuss the budget and final accounts for 1933, the organization of the clearing house, the election of officers, and the opening date, etc.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industries Express Views on Shipment of Silver Dollars to the Northeast</h3>
<p>Supplementing Finance, No Other Effect</p>
<p>The recent large-scale shipment of silver dollars from this city to the Northeast has attracted attention from all sectors. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to the silver and money industries to inquire. The following are the details learned by reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency who went to the silver and money industries to inquire:</p>
<p>Banking Industry: Mr. Lin Kanghou, the Secretary-General of the Banking Industry Association, said that the Northeast has abundant resources, reaching the whole country. The total amount of soybeans and sorghum transported to the south each year is about 20 to 30 million yuan. This time, the banking industry's shipment of silver for export is purely commercial in nature, such as: ㈠ After the Three Northeastern Provinces were occupied by Japan, our country has never recognized the puppet state. Therefore, the sorghum and soybeans produced there are still national goods. If merchants purchase them, they must use silver dollars. ㈡ Since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese banks in the Three Northeastern Provinces, the local residents do not trust banknotes and hoard silver dollars. For deposits, they withdraw them together. In fact, it is necessary to transport silver there to supplement them. In short, the banking industry's shipment of silver for export has no other effect. Moreover, commercial firms and foreign banks are the most likely to ship silver for export.</p>
<p>Money Shop Industry: Mr. Qin Xieqing, the Secretary-General of the Money Shop Industry Association, said that commercial firms ship the most silver dollars to the Three Northeastern Provinces. Since the money shop industry has no branches there, there is no need to transport silver there to supplement them. Commercial firms purchase silver dollars from money shops. Under the circumstances of depression in various industries, money shops have long stopped lending. Therefore, silver must be exchanged for silver dollars. This exchange is purely commercial in nature. For example, since there is a large amount of silver exported, the silver rate will inevitably be tight. Today (i.e., yesterday), the silver rate was 7 qian, 1 fen, 4 li, and 625 si in the morning, and 7 qian, 1 fen, and 4 li in the afternoon, which is slightly the same as before. It can be seen that there is a large amount of silver stored in this city, which is a phenomenon due to the sluggishness of industry and commerce in various places.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Strictly Restricts Free Train Rides</h3>
<p>Strictly Verify Official Travel Passes</p>
<p>Directors Huang of Both Railways Issue Circulars for Notification</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that various free official travel passes are issued without restriction, which wastes railway funds and has a significant impact, especially on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau. Often, the first-class seats are almost entirely free tickets, and even additional carriages are added, but most of them are not truly necessary for official business. What is even more hateful is that they even carry people without tickets, occupying seats, which makes it difficult for paying passengers to find seats. This kind of treatment is extremely unfair, causing outside complaints. The railway bureau privately issues various long-term free passes without standards. When checking tickets, they do not verify the photos or ask about job titles. They simply glance at the red pass and let them pass. Therefore, there are often situations of borrowing. In addition to the staff of the ministry and railway departments, there are also other government officials and private individuals who obtain free passes by currying favor with important officials of the ministry and railway departments. Railway staff often bring relatives and friends to ride the train without tickets. The corruption of railway affairs can be said to have reached its extreme. These people who abuse their power, disrupt railway discipline, and erode railway administration have become accustomed to it and are shameless. The true customers of the railway, the passengers who pay for tickets, are inconvenienced as a result. There is nothing more unfair than this. It is now heard that the ministry intends to correct the abuses and rectify passenger transportation.</p>
<p>A general order has been issued to all railways that, except for railway staff who need to travel on official business, no long-term free passes of any kind shall be issued. Furthermore, the official travel passes for the ministry's staff have also been strictly regulated. They must be issued only if they are indeed on official business and comply with the regulations. It is also heard that the long-term passes for the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus that have already been issued in advance for use next year have also been ordered by the ministry to be invalidated.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways, in view of the past abuses in issuing free tickets by the two railways, which is contrary to the original intention of reorganization and revival, has instructed the Business Department to formulate strict restrictions and has telegraphed Directors Huang of both railways to comply. All free travel permits for 1933, except those that are truly necessary for official business and have been submitted to the ministry for approval before being issued, shall be issued later. Those that have already been issued shall be invalid. It is heard that the railway bureau has received the ministry's telegram and has issued a circular for notification.</p>
<h3>Today at Noon, All Circles Comfort the Anti-Japanese Generals of the Fifth Army</h3>
<p>Location: YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge</p>
<p>During the previous Songhu Anti-Japanese War, the Fifth Army was in a critical position. In the Battle of Miaohang, it made outstanding contributions. Sun Yuanliang, the commander of the 88th Division of the army, and Li Yueyang, the commander of the 159th Brigade, who personally experienced the bloody battle, are currently in Shanghai. The various circles in this city deeply appreciate the army's loyalty and bravery in defending the country, and have specially invited Sun and Li to a luncheon at the Western-style restaurant on the ninth floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge at 12:00 noon today (Wednesday, the 28th) to express their condolences. Representatives from all circles can join in temporarily. There will surely be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Has Not Yet Gone to Beijing</h3>
<p>Mr. Song Ziwen, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, was originally scheduled to fly to Beijing yesterday on his private Sikorsky aircraft to attend the Executive Yuan meeting. Therefore, he telegraphed Beijing the day before yesterday, ordering the aircraft to fly to Shanghai to await orders. The aircraft flew to Wuxi, but was blocked by heavy rain and returned to Nanjing. Mr. Song then changed his plans to take the night train to Beijing the night before last, but he did not go due to some matters. He did not depart again yesterday due to bad weather. It is heard that Mr. Song still has important matters to deal with in Shanghai, so he has decided to spend the New Year in Shanghai and will go to Beijing at the beginning of next year.</p>
<h3>Chen Bu Lei's Remarks</h3>
<p>Chen Bu Lei came to Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him. According to Chen, Zhejiang Province is in good condition recently, but the finances are quite difficult. They are now making great efforts to tighten spending. The expenses of the various departments of the provincial government and the secretarial office and the security office have been reduced by 30% across the board. This is a temporary solution. The fundamental solution is to reorganize the land tax. However, the reorganization of the land tax will take at least two years to take effect. At present, we can only make great efforts to tighten spending in order to seek remedies. Commander Chiang's return to Fenghua this time is to sweep the tombs. He will stay for about a week and then go to Beijing, and plans to visit Hangzhou on the way to Beijing. I will probably stay for two or three days and then return to Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Summary of News from the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Geng Jizhou Thanks the Support Association: The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter from Geng Jizhou, the commander of the Fourth Route of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, yesterday, saying: "Respected Sirs, I am grateful that your association has issued 347 sets of cotton clothes, which have been transported in full by our army representative Yang Yijie. After being distributed to the officers and soldiers of our army, in addition to being grateful, we are more determined to kill the thieves and destroy the captives. Your benevolence and righteous deeds shine in the world. We look forward to Shenbin and are very admiring. However, there are more people than clothes, and the distribution is insufficient. The cold north wind is getting worse day by day. If we cannot maintain body temperature, how can we deal with the violent bandits? Moreover, our army is now stationed in western Liaoning and has become the target of the Japanese army's general attack. Fortunately, all the healthy soldiers of our army have long embraced the determination to die and have repeatedly thwarted the fierce attacks. However, without a large amount of assistance, it will be difficult to sustain. Your association is eager to save the country's difficulties and is determined to restore our rivers and mountains. You will surely give us love and care and plan effective methods. On behalf of all the officers and soldiers, I would like to express our gratitude to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association. Geng Jizhou, December 13th."</p>
<p>Xia Tengfei and Others Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday: Feng Zhanhai, the Commander-in-Chief of the Border-Protecting National Salvation Army, has recently repeatedly conquered Tongliao, Nongan, and other places, and his military achievements are outstanding. Recently, due to the Japanese bandits' invasion of the Hebei region, the situation is serious, so he specially sent Chief of Staff Xia Tengfei and Director of the Liaison Office Pang Taifeng south to Shanghai yesterday morning to report to various circles on the army's recent combat situation and to discuss support matters. Yesterday evening, they accompanied the representatives of various armies, including Duan Zhongfan, the Chief of Military Law of General Ma Zhanshan, representative Wu Huanzhang, representatives of Ding Chao and Li Du, Wang Ziyao, Liu Piguang, and representatives of Wang Delin, Liang Detang, and took the express train at 11:45 last night to Beijing together. Zhu Jiqing's Letter on the War Situation: Hualian News Agency's report from this city, "Brother Hou Wu Jian, It has been several months since we parted, and we have not communicated. I am deeply sorry. However, I learned about your recent situation and the fundraising from Brother Shouyu's letter, and I am very grateful. The National Salvation Army in Liaoning and Jilin have all made considerable achievements, but I have not made any progress in attacking Jinzhou and Yi, and I am ashamed of you and the people of the country. I think that gathering a large number of untrained people, both offense and defense are uncertain. Recently, I want to compile a basic team and equip them with a large number of special weapons, which should be beneficial. I hope you will provide assistance in every possible way. The course of the war has already been seen in the newspapers, so I will not repeat it. I wish you all the best and hope you will give my regards to all my friends. I will not write separately. Shi Jiqing, December 13th."</p>
<h3>County Government Plans to Build Granaries for Grain Storage</h3>
<p>Three Methods Agreed Upon</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government believes that the matter of grain storage is related to the important political task of preparing for famine. Recently, it has also received orders from the provincial government urging the construction of granaries. However, the county's public funds are extremely stretched. Therefore, County Magistrate Yan sent a letter to the Bean and Rice Industry Association of the urban area requesting donations for grain storage. The association generously donated 10,000 yuan in foreign currency, which, together with other funds, totaled 15,000 yuan. County granaries can be built. Therefore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, the second committee meeting of the County Granary Grain Management Committee was convened. The committee members present were County Magistrate Yan, Wang Huazhao (substituting for Wang Juntang), Zhang Jingye, Jiang Shijie, and Zhang Yi. Ye Dezhen, the county secretary, attended as an observer. Four committee members, including Kang Yongnian, were absent. More than half of the legal number were present. Chairman Yan, the committee member, and recorder Hu Gongshou, after the chairman reported on the agenda, proposed the construction of the county's grain storage granaries. After discussion, three methods were resolved: ㈠ Distribution of funds: 7,000 yuan for building granaries in the new county seat, and 8,000 yuan for preparing to purchase grain. ㈡ Location of the granary base: Determined to be north of Tangbei Road and west of Hengli in the new county seat, purchasing 5 mu of land. ㈢ Appointing members to prepare: Appointing the three standing committee members Yan (Yu), Jiang (Shijie), and Zhang (Jingye) and committee member Zhang Yi and Director of the Construction Bureau Sun to actively plan and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Works Dredges Yuan Chang River</h3>
<p>Public Notice No. 194 of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works: Public notice regarding the dredging of the Yuan Chang River. The Yuan Chang River is an important waterway in the northwest of the city center. Due to the fact that it has not been dredged for many years, the riverbed is silted up and shallow. In addition, there is a great need for earthwork for the road and foundation projects in the second reclamation area in the city center. It is proposed to excavate in the river. The municipal meeting has resolved to dredge the river. Now, this river project is about to begin. The Land Bureau has sent personnel to measure the land. In the future, the parts of the river that need to be curved and straightened, and require private land, will be purchased at a fair price. A public notice is hereby issued to inform the villagers.</p>

<h3>The Pudong Native Place Association Will Strive Again to Exempt the Winter Grain Tax Surcharge</h3>
<p>This year's winter grain tax is still surcharged by two yuan per stone. The Pudong Native Place Association, citing the Ministry of Finance's order received in June of this year, approved by the Executive Yuan, that no additional surcharge will be levied from the 21st year, submitted a request to exempt the surcharge in order to show great faith. Yesterday, they received a fast mail telegram from the Ministry of Finance, number Fu Zi 989, stating: "Shanghai Pudong Native Place Association, the original telegram is noted. Jiangsu Province's winter tax this year is surcharged two yuan per stone, previously approved by the Executive Yuan on file. This is to inform you in reply. Ministry of Finance's seal." It is heard that the Pudong Native Place Association will submit another request to the Executive Yuan to strive for exemption.</p>
<h3>Colonel Hawke's Funeral Scheduled</h3>
<p>The "Da Mei Evening News" reported that after Colonel Hawke, the commander of the 4th Regiment of the US Marine Corps, died in Shanghai, the national funeral will be held at the Grand Church on Sanma Road from 12:00 to 2:00 PM on Thursday so that friends and former officials can pay their respects. After 2:00 PM, there will be prayers. At that time, Chinese and foreign officials and navies from various countries will send representatives to participate. After the ceremony, the body will be returned to the International Funeral Parlor. It is estimated that it will be transported back to the United States by the President Coolidge ship around January 7 and buried in the Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, DC. It is heard that when the coffin is returned to the International Funeral Parlor, troops from the various countries' armies and navies and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will be dispatched from west of Gordon Road, with one person every three feet, to escort the body and show respect. When it arrives at the funeral parlor, the US Marine Corps will fire a salute to pay tribute.</p>
<h3>Survivors of the Sinking of the New Futai Ship Can Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>All Thirty-Four People Transported by the Tongshun Ship</p>
<p>The New Futai Ship of the Heping Shipping Company, managed by the Futai Shipping Co., Ltd., ran aground and struck a reef on the Tongsha sea area on the morning of the 26th. The entire ship sank, causing great losses. The crew members and sailors were rescued by the Tongshun ship and can come to Shanghai today. Further details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>The Ship Sinks to the Bottom of the Sea</h3>
<p>The New Futai Ship struck a reef at 4:45 AM on the 26th. Initially, only the third cabin was breached. However, since the damaged area was below the waterline, seawater flooded the cabin. After 10:00 AM, the engine room was also affected. When the engine room flooded, the boiler went out, and the ship could not move. The telegraph was also out of service. The ship sank directly into the sea. By noon, the entire ship had sunk into the sea. Yesterday, the company received a telegram stating that only a small section of the chimney was visible at low tide. The pilot platform, main building, etc., were all submerged in the sea. The ship could not be seen when the tide rose.</p>
<h3>Rescue of the Crew</h3>
<p>When the ship was sinking, the shipowner, K. S. Mun, the chief officer, the second officer, the chief engineer, and others first ordered all the sailors to leave the ship and escape in lifeboats. The last to leave the ship was the shipowner. The crew members drifted in the sea and were seen by the Taizan Maru ship of the Japanese Osaka Company, which rescued 24 of the crew members and sailors. There were also 10 sailors, stokers, etc., who escaped by sampan and were rescued by the pilot boat there. Therefore, all the crew members were rescued.</p>
<h3>Tongshun Assists in Rescue</h3>
<p>The Datong Company's Tongshun ship was transporting coal from Hongji to Nanjing this time. On the 26th, it passed through Tongsha and heard about the New Futai's accident. The shipowner of the Tongshun and Qian Fulin, the shipowner of the New Futai, were close friends, so they risked going to the scene of the accident to rescue the crew members. At that time, the crew members had already been rescued by Japanese ships, etc. After the Tongshun searched with its whistle, the Japanese ship Taizan Maru transferred the rescued people and the people rescued by the pilot boat to the Tongshun ship, which carried them to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, the Heping Company received a telegram from the Tongshun stating that it had rescued the crew members and was scheduled to arrive at Wusong this morning. It is estimated that it could sail into the Huangpu River and arrive safely in Shanghai before noon.</p>
<h3>Sinking Ship Cannot Be Salvaged</h3>
<p>According to the staff of the Heping Company who spoke to this reporter, the location of the New Futai's accident is between shallow sand and reefs, and ships cannot sail to that sea area. Therefore, the sunken ship and cargo cannot be salvaged. The New Futai Ship had a gross tonnage of 4,200 tons. When it was purchased, the ship price was 160,000 taels. The Zhongxing coal inside the ship was also worth 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. In addition to the clothes of the crew members and sailors, the total loss is 300,000 yuan. However, they had purchased 100,000 taels of peace insurance from Zhaotai and others. After the accident, Heping has reported to various insurance companies and sent personnel to Tongsha to inspect. At the same time, it has reported to the Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Director and the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Two Radiograms</h3>
<p>After the New Futai ship sank in the Tongsha sea area, the Tongshun ship, which sailed to rescue it, sent two radiograms to Shanghai yesterday. The first telegram was sent at 10:40 AM, reporting that the surviving crew members of the New Futai were living on Sanjian Island and were currently being rescued and boarding the ship. The second telegram said that 17 people had been rescued from Sanjian Island, fearing that only this number of the 52 crew members of the New Futai had been rescued. In addition, three bodies were found. It is said that the shipowner, chief officer, engineer, and radio operator had all drowned. Please send someone to Wusong at dawn tomorrow to meet the rescued people. The ship will sail to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>The Luning Airplane Will Be Flown to Shanghai for Repairs</h3>
<p>Nie Kaiyi Will Return to Shanghai Today</p>
<p>｜The Airplane Flying South from Shanghai-Hankou Did Not Arrive Yesterday｜</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that the China National Aviation Corporation's No. 14 "Luning" aircraft, which flies the Shanghai-Hankou line, made an emergency landing due to heavy fog at about 10:15 AM on the 25th at a certain location 30 miles from Nanjing. The passengers and pilots in the aircraft were all safe. The following are the messages received yesterday:</p>
<p>Nie Kaiyi Returns to Shanghai: The Shanghai General Company received a telegram from the Nanyang Branch at noon on the 26th, reporting that the "Luning" aircraft made an emergency landing due to fog. The company, in order to clarify the facts, specially dispatched Nie Kaiyi, the director of the aircraft maintenance team, and pilot Anderson to fly to Beijing to investigate everything. Mr. Nie and others were originally scheduled to take a plane back to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, but were again blocked by fog. It is heard that they are scheduled to return to Shanghai today.</p>
<p>The Luning Airplane Will Be Flown Back: A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Secretary Li of the China National Aviation Corporation yesterday. According to him, the "Luning" amphibian aircraft made an emergency landing at that time due to the heavy fog. The pilot made an emergency landing 30 miles from Beijing for safety reasons and there were no major losses. An emergency landing of an airplane is the same as a train delay and is not surprising. At present, the company plans to fly the Luning airplane back to Shanghai for repairs immediately.</p>
<p>Airplane Flying South Did Not Arrive Yesterday: The weather has been unstable for several days, the climate is changing infinitely, and there is heavy fog, so navigation has naturally encountered various difficulties. The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hankou line airplanes originally flew daily, but the airplane flying south did not arrive in Shanghai yesterday and was grounded due to fog.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Requests Amendment to Stamp Tax Penalty Regulations</h3>
<p>Allowing a reasonable period of hesitation after sentencing</p>
<p>Re-examination should be allowed if reasons for objection are presented</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Regarding the petition, on the 25th of this month, we received a joint letter from over one hundred trade associations, including the paper, woolen fabric, mercerized cotton weaving, sausage, mineral ash factory, cotton cloth, knitwear, department store, coal, silk and satin, clock and watch, gold, candle, and footwear industries, stating: 'We have learned that the stamp tax bureau's inspection of stamps has been reported by merchants that inspectors have been wantonly harassing, exceeding the scope of the stamp tax regulations, deliberately finding fault, and imposing heavy penalties everywhere. During store inspections, they often overturn boxes and ransack containers, searching at will. Even scraps of paper with temporary notes or memos with temporary numbers are copied and fined. When enforcing penalties, they often summon people to the bureau and order them to pay the fines immediately. Only after the fines are paid do they show the penalty receipts. Otherwise, they detain them. This is not the way to convince merchants. After discussing relief measures, the associations decided to petition the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce to forward the current stamp tax penalty rules to the Ministry of Finance, as they are prone to abuses and should be quickly amended.' The Ministry's instructions to the Shandong Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau on September 14th included the province's original proposed procedures for inspection, stating that 'during inspections, whether of shops or residences, local police must be present, and the parties involved must be advised to hand over all books, contracts, etc., and that there should be no forceful entry into accounting rooms or arbitrary searches.' It was reported that 'after explaining the inspection section of the sixth item of the reply, it is still feasible.' The reports from the trade associations mentioned above stated that 'overturning boxes and ransacking containers, searching at will,' is tantamount to harassment. We propose that the Ministry circulate this instruction to all provinces for compliance to facilitate the people and merchants. As for the current Stamp Tax Regulation Review Committee, it originally conducts reviews in writing, and the parties concerned have no opportunity to appear and defend themselves. Once a penalty is imposed, they must be summoned to the bureau to forcibly pay the fine. Only after the fine is paid is the penalty receipt shown. Thus, even if the penalized party has reasons to defend themselves in accordance with the law, or if the case is actually due to the tax bureau's misapplication or misunderstanding, the fine has already been paid and cannot be changed. This penalty procedure is unfair. We propose that during the review, the person being reviewed should be notified in advance, and those who wish to appear and defend themselves should be allowed to do so, and those who do not wish to appear should not be forced. Alternatively, after the penalty is imposed, a reasonable period of hesitation should be allowed. If the penalized person presents objections and there are indeed reasons, the previous judgment may be reviewed and changed. Although this would add a step for the tax bureau, it would make the process easier to manage in detail. Therefore, we are submitting this document to the Ministry for review, hoping that you will adopt and implement it for the public good." We respectfully submit this to the Ministry of Finance.</p>

The telegram stated that the original telegrams from party and government departments and associations had been signed and sealed by all overseas Chinese groups and businesses and sent by express mail. It reads: "To the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper Office: Recently, we read in the Shanghai Morning Post that your association, without fully investigating the case of Consul Liang Rongsun's dismissal, sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting his removal. This is reckless and extremely inappropriate, causing deep indignation among overseas Chinese. We hereby state the true situation as a warning after the fact. Zhang Nianyi, Xie Liantang, Qiu Yiheng, and others, the current standing committee members of the Medan Sudong General Chamber of Commerce, are merely pompous and notorious pests in the community. During the re-election of officers in April 1930, they gathered over thirty cronies to the meeting, abruptly changed the old rules, and destroyed the ballots cast by members, resulting in the election of a single faction. They then changed the original location name of the Deli Chamber of Commerce, CnderafdeelingDelionderGollvernementOostkustvanSumatra, to the General Chamber of Commerce of the Entire Region Under the Government of the East Coast of Sumatra (ignoring that each port has its own chamber of commerce, and crowning it with the title of the General Chamber of Commerce of the East Coast of Sumatra, as if the Guangzhou City Chamber of Commerce could be called the General Chamber of Commerce of the Entire Guangdong Province—their absurdity is such). They violated the rules and disregarded public opinion. For a time, the members of the association publicly opposed it in the newspapers, and the entire supervisory committee made a declaration of resignation. The standing committee's unauthorized change of name and illegal organizational actions have lost the trust of overseas Chinese merchants. The local government also does not value their actions. Therefore, the reported amendments to the constitution have not yet been approved. It is clear that such an unsound organization cannot represent public opinion. (The Sudong region has over ten thousand stores, but the association has less than three hundred members, including merchants or individuals from near and far, and less than half are major businesses.) The standing committee members colluded with the former consul Zuo Lin, and daily engaged in deceptive tactics for their own benefit. After Consul Liang arrived in Medan following Zuo's dismissal, the standing committee, having lost its protective amulet, became jealous and resentful, and engaged in planned sabotage. When the consulate was handling the handover, they incited delays and resistance. When the consulate initially discussed the consulate's financial difficulties, they ridiculed it as extortion for personal gain. When the consulate entrusted the handling of nationality registration, all overseas Chinese groups eagerly offered assistance, but the standing committee not only refused to accept it but also published it in newspapers and sent special letters to various ports to undermine it. When the consulate made preliminary negotiations with the local Sultan regarding the hawker incident, they instigated the People's Daily to publish articles attacking it. In another instance, when a small number of merchants established an association to collect a 30% refund of freight charges from shipping companies, Consul Liang, at the request of the merchants, inquired about suspected monopoly and fraud, and was accused of undermining public welfare. After the consulate received instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that the chamber of commerce should be re-elected on a regular basis in accordance with the law, they refused to respond. (It is said that the former Consul colluded with the consulate to conceal the report, and the consulate has no records to check.) There were countless such acts of framing. Although Consul Liang interacted with them daily, he could never gain their cooperation. Their prejudice was obvious. Because of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's instructions, the standing committee passed a resolution on June 11th, instructing the standing committee to explain the reasons for the reorganization and renaming to the public. However, the standing committee violated the resolution and brazenly made a fierce declaration attacking the consulate, which was published in newspapers and distributed in leaflets on June 29th, defaming and slandering without reservation. At the same time, they also sent a secretary to beg the Dutch newspaper to publish slanderous articles (the Dutch newspaper stated that it was the association's secretary who orally reported it). Attacking from both within and without, they became a laughingstock to other countries. Public opinion was in an uproar, and the overseas Chinese were resentful. At that time, members of the association successively published denials in the newspapers, and even members of the supervisory committee held meetings to question Medan community groups and overseas Chinese businesses, and even launched a collective condemnation (the original newspaper has been attached to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce). The standing committee, being the target of public criticism, could not defend themselves. The standing committee, still unbridled, not only filed complaints everywhere but also colluded with Song Faxiang, the Consul General in Batavia, to protect their biases, causing social unrest. Members of the executive and supervisory committees, such as Chen Tianjiu, felt that the merchant organization was being used by a few people as a tool to humiliate the country, and the reputation of all members was swept away. Therefore, they successively published resignations in the newspapers. Currently, the chamber of commerce has become an organization with insufficient legal officers. Your association has been deceived and blindly followed suit, sending telegrams back and forth as if your association would be adversely affected if Consul Liang did not leave. Otherwise, why would you exert so much effort? In fact, your association has nothing to do with this case. In terms of scope, it is absolutely impossible to accept the transfer of control. Now, you have actually accepted the transfer of control and, without distinguishing right from wrong, immediately stated that Consul Liang published the statement of distrust of the chamber of commerce in the Dutch government's official newspaper, which is a disgrace to the country, in order to confirm his crime. In Medan, there are only two foreign business newspapers and no Dutch government official newspaper. We have also not seen Liang act in such an unseemly manner. It was the standing committee that sought to publish slanderous articles themselves. Who is humiliating the country? The truth is obvious. The overseas Chinese groups now consider the association's absurdity a great shame and insult. What will your association think when you hear about this? Can you send telegrams back and forth to protect the country's image and quell the overseas Chinese's public anger? In short, your association was unaware of the social situation in Medan, the content of the chamber of commerce, and the character of the standing committee, and rashly stepped in to open an unprecedented situation. This is the overseas Chinese group's great regret for your association. Your association is in a prominent position close to key officials. Do you really want to use your residual power to exert it overseas? Otherwise, how could you be so reckless? After Consul Liang was ordered to be dismissed, the overseas Chinese groups already felt that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was reversing right and wrong and disregarding public opinion. Knowing that although petitions were sent, the situation was still isolated, and it was useless to retain him, we were determined not to interfere further. Now, we know that the authorities' resolute decision was due to the collusion of all the gentlemen of your association who acted as accomplices. Alas, the country has been in turmoil in recent years, and the political situation has been constantly changing. Now, the absurdity of your association is enough to prove it, and we cannot help but feel sorry for the party and the country's future. Consul Liang is deeply loved and respected by the overseas Chinese. Therefore, when he left Medan this time, over twenty overseas Chinese groups held a meeting to bid him farewell, and banquets were held every night to send him off. His virtue was praised in the southern region, and overseas Chinese sang praises. Silver tripods and shields were engraved to commemorate his protection of overseas Chinese, and they were presented one after another. On the eve of his departure, hundreds of people from party, government, industry, commerce, education, and newspaper circles lay down on the road to see him off. It was an unprecedented grand occasion in Medan. If Consul Liang had really oppressed overseas Chinese merchants, as your association claims, how could he have received such sincere support? (The original newspaper has also been attached to the association.) The overseas Chinese groups, driven by justice, have detailed the facts, hoping that your association will reflect on them. Please show us the four major points of accusation against Liang, so that the public can criticize them. We await your reply with the utmost urgency. In addition to sending copies to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, all courts, associations, and party, government, industry, commerce, education, and newspaper organizations at home and abroad, we respectfully ask you to review and clarify the truth and avoid being deceived by one-sided information. November 26, 1932."</p>

<h3>Li Guojie Sentenced to Three Years in Prison</h3>
<p>Chen Fumu's Trial Suspended Pending Arrest</p>
<p>Bribe of 700,000 Taels of Silver to Foreigners to be Recovered and Confiscated</p>
<p>Li Guojie, the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Chen Fumu, the concurrent supervisor, were accused of privately borrowing foreign debts and signing loan contracts with the American-owned China Trading Corporation using the wharves and docks, as well as leasing merchant ships from the Dalae Steamship Company, which harmed navigation rights, and of delivering a bribe of 700,000 taels of silver to Chen Fumu. The local court pronounced its verdict yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. After lunch, the first courtroom was already filled with people who had come to listen. Therefore, the court dispatched police chiefs Chen Junfang and police officers Chen Xihui and Zhu Wenqing to maintain order. Li Guojie was brought from the Shanghai Hospital. Soon after, the criminal court judge Qian Chengjun, judges Shen Youqi and Sun Xiaolou, prosecutor Xie Lian, and clerk Jiang Meixuan all arrived at the court. Li Guojie and his defense lawyers Jiang Yiping and Sha Xunyi arrived at court. The presiding judge Qian Chengjun stood up and read the verdict: "Li Guojie, together with others, violated his duties, causing damage to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and is sentenced to two years of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for four years. He also violated his duties by delivering a bribe, and is sentenced to two years of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for four years. The sentences will be served concurrently for a total of three years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for four years. The number of days of detention prior to the final judgment will be deducted from the prison sentence at a rate of two days for each day. Chen Fumu's trial is suspended. The bribe of 700,000 taels of silver will be recovered and confiscated." After the verdict was pronounced, the reasons for the judgment were read to Li Guojie. The reasons were roughly as follows: if the treaty was not fulfilled as stipulated in the contract, there was the right to confiscate it and dispose of it according to American law, and the items such as borrowing money from Dalae to buy ships and inserting American flags were all matters of losing rights and damaging wealth, and the bribe of 700,000 was proved by Li's confession during the investigation because he did not care about small anger and only cared about big things. However, because he voluntarily reported and confessed, a one-third reduction was made in accordance with the part of the criminal addition of the public servant, and the verdict of the main text was imposed. Chen Fumu's whereabouts were unknown, and another trial would be held when he was arrested. At this point, lawyer Jiang Yiping immediately appealed on behalf of Chen in court. The official advised that an appeal could be made to the Jiangsu Higher Court within ten days of receiving the verdict. Li was still not fully recovered from his illness and was sent back to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's High Tide Reached Over Thirty-Eight Feet in the Local Area</h3>
<p>In recent days, the south wind has been strong, the rain has been drizzling, the weather has been warm, and the tide has been surging. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the tide at Wusong Wenzao Creek was very high, level with the road, causing low-lying areas on the south bank to become flooded. According to customs officials, yesterday's tide rose to over thirty-eight feet, and the night tide was even higher. It is rare to have such a high tide in winter.</p>
<h3>More Than Two Thousand Workers at Housheng Sue for Profit-Sharing, Negotiations Break Down</h3>
<p>No Possibility of Reconciliation Between the Two Parties</p>
<p>Judge Orders Decision to be Announced on a Set Date</p>
<p>Since the Housheng Yarn Factory ceased operations, its staff and workers have repeatedly sued the factory's directors, Bei Runsheng and Xue Gansheng, in order to receive their share of the profits. For a year, Bei and Xue have been shuttling back and forth to court, with hardly a peaceful day. In the end, most cases were settled with compensation. However, as soon as one case was closed, another arose. Now, representatives Xu Guiquan, Wang Genxin, Chen Hongquan, Jin Jiajun, and others, claiming to represent 2,483 workers at Housheng, hired lawyers to demand that Bei and Xue share the profits, citing previous precedents. When they did not agree, they also filed a lawsuit for embezzlement in the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qian Wenji opened the court to hear the case, and both plaintiffs and defendants arrived with their respective lawyers. Judge Qian first instructed the plaintiffs that the defendants had filed a counter-suit accusing them of making false accusations. Since you claim that you want to share the profits, you should provide proof. Xu Guiquan, upon hearing this, immediately stated that "Wan Heshang and others did the same work as us, and Wan and others have already received their share of the profits one after another, so we should receive the same treatment. We have letters from the workers' union that can prove it. We are all permanent workers," and so on. The plaintiffs' lawyer then explained the factory's employment system, saying that the factory's workers were divided into three types: monthly workers, daily workers, and temporary hires. The only difference between daily workers and monthly workers was that they were paid on a daily basis. Although the plaintiffs were all daily workers, many of them had worked for two or three years or more, so they should be considered permanent workers. As for whether they were entitled to a share of the profits, there had been too many lawsuits involving the factory's workers. Although some judgments had been dismissed, the results of each case had been that the workers received a share of the profits. The lawyer also cited the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau's mediation of a labor dispute involving workers at the South Railway Station as proof, saying that if the company had a surplus, 20% should be allocated to the workers as compensation. All Housheng workers had already received this share of the profits, so it would be unfair to exclude the plaintiffs. The defendants' lawyer also presented the Housheng Yarn Factory's articles of association, saying that even if there was a surplus, only the staff could share in it, not the workers. Moreover, since the plaintiffs were daily workers, their employment was temporary in nature, and they had no right to claim a share of the profits. Furthermore, the factory had no surplus at all. As for Wan Heshang Ji Weisan and others, they were only given some money after their lawsuit failed and during the January 28th Incident to help them return to their hometowns. Who knew that they would now be used as a pretext by the plaintiffs? It was truly difficult to do good deeds. The plaintiffs' lawyer then declared that Ji Weisan and others had reached a settlement outside of court and received seventy yuan each. Now, the plaintiffs only hoped to receive half that amount, thirty-five yuan each. Therefore, the plaintiffs' incidental civil suit was for a total of 86,950 yuan. The court then questioned the two defendants again. Because the two parties insisted on their own positions and there was no possibility of reconciliation, they ordered the lawyers from both sides to begin their arguments and concluded by ordering a decision to be announced on a set date.</p>
<h3>Small-Scale Robbery Case Solved in Two Hours</h3>
<p>Deda Rice Store Loses Over Eighty Yuan</p>
<p>Soap-Made Pistol and Stolen Goods Hidden in Socks</p>
<p>A robbery occurred near the Nanxiaonanmennei Yujialong area in the Southern District on the day before yesterday, around 5:00 PM. The victim was a rice store, which was robbed of over eighty silver dollars. The robbers then took the loot to the Desheng Restaurant on Xiangma Road and Wangmiao Street for dinner, where they were apprehended by the police. From the time of the robbery to the time the case was solved, only two hours had passed. Such speed was truly unexpected. The details of the case are recorded below: Xu Jiaren, a local resident, had been operating the Deda Rice Store at No. 171 Yujialong, Nanxiaonanmennei. On the day before yesterday, around 5:00 PM, two robbers suddenly came in, both around thirty years old, wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants. They broke into the store and each pulled out a pistol, threatening to make noise and shouting at the shop's accountant, "Where is the money?" At the time, the accountant saw the situation, knew that robbers had arrived, and was very frightened. He honestly answered that the money was in the cash register drawer. The robbers immediately opened the drawer and took all the silver dollars, over eighty yuan, and fled with the loot. The people in the store waited until the robbers had gone far away before calming down and reporting the incident to the 3rd Precinct of the 1st District, which had jurisdiction over the area, at 7:00 PM. After receiving the report, Chief Jin immediately used the telephone to report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the various district precincts, instructing them to pay attention to the investigation. Soon after, police chief Zhu Lianqing and police officers Shan Changyong and Dong Huaizhu from the 1st Precinct were patrolling the streets and passed by the Desheng Restaurant on Xiangma Road and Wangmiao Street. They noticed four men and a woman sitting together at a table inside the restaurant, eating heartily, but their behavior was suspicious. They immediately went inside and searched the group, but no contraband was found. When questioned about their origins, they were evasive. They were all taken to the station, where the chief interrogated them separately. Zhang Yiwen, 35 years old, from Yancheng, residing at No. 110 Laobaidu Street, confessed that this afternoon, he and his friends Li Jinsheng, Yong Jinbao, and Zhou Lianbao, the three arrested, met at a small teahouse in Lujiabang, bringing with them two pistols, one real and one fake. The real one he had bought from the front for forty yuan during the January 28 Incident. The fake one he had made from soap. At around 5:00 PM, they went to rob a rice store in Yujialong, Nanxiaonanmennei. Yong Jinbao and Zhou Lianbao waited outside as lookouts, while he and Li Jinsheng broke into the store. He pulled out the real pistol, and Li pulled out the fake pistol, threatening the people in the store to not make a sound, and they were able to rob them. After escaping with the loot, they went back to the small teahouse in Lujiabang, met up, and divided the loot. Li Jinsheng then called his mistress, Ma Gaoshi, and his mistress, Wu Zhoushi, the woman in the case, to come. He gave the real pistol to Ma Gaoshi to take back and hide, and he destroyed the fake pistol and threw it away by the side of the road. At that time, they saw that it was late, so they all entered the restaurant to fill their stomachs, when they were arrested by the police and brought to the station. Li Jinsheng, 34 years old, from Tongzhou, confessed that Ma Gaoshi had been his mistress for over ten years, and he was currently living with her at No. 45 Xie Xingli, Nanjing Street. The rest of his confession was the same as Zhang's. Yong Jinbao, 26 years old, from Gaoyou, confessed that the rest of his story was roughly the same as Zhang's. Zhou Lianbao, 32 years old, from Tongzhou, confessed that he lived in the same place as Li Jinsheng, and the rest of his story was the same as Zhang's. Wu Zhoushi, 25 years old, from Gaoyou, confessed that although she was Zhang's mistress, she really did not know about his actions outside. At the time, the police found twenty-two dollars and two cents of stolen money hidden on Zhou Yiwen's body, six dollars and four cents on Li Jinsheng's body, six dollars and one cent on Yong Jinbao's body, and four dollars and six cents on Zhou Lianbao's body. Most strangely, all of them had hidden the stolen money in their socks. They were ordered to be detained separately, and police officers were dispatched to Li Jinsheng's house to arrest his mistress, Ma Gaoshi, and his roommate, Chen Wushi, and interrogate them further. Ma Gaoshi, 51 years old, from Gaoyou, confessed that today, Zhang Yiwen had given her a pistol to take back, and she had immediately handed it over to his friend Xiao Wangzi to take out and hide. Chen Wushi, 32 years old, from Gaoyou, confessed that she lived with Ma Gaoshi and others, but she really did not know about their actions. Because the matter concerned robbery, it was ordered that the men and women be taken to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Charity Lottery Tickets Sell Well</h3>
<p>The International Charity Horse Racing Special Prize Lottery Tickets, which have been selling in the local area recently, are selling very well because a free ticket is given for every ten tickets purchased at once, and the prize money is higher than that of ordinary champagne tickets. The banks, companies, newspapers, institutions, and organizations that sell the tickets are all very crowded. It is said that it is possible that they will be sold out soon. Recently, even small money shops on the streets, although not designated as sales agents, have been buying and reselling tickets. This is because the lottery tickets have a charitable nature, and promoting them is tantamount to helping a good cause. Moreover, there are many people who buy tickets individually, so it is possible to purchase ten tickets for one hundred yuan in cash from a sales agent, receive a free ticket (for a total of eleven tickets), and then resell them individually to obtain a considerable profit. If only ten tickets are sold, the remaining free ticket has a chance of winning a prize. It is possible to achieve multiple goals at once, so many people are happy to promote them.</p>
<h3>News of the North China Daily News Raising Relief Funds for Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News of this city, every Christmas, raises relief funds for rickshaw pullers, which are then handed over to the Rickshaw Pullers' Gospel Society to purchase food and clothing for distribution to impoverished rickshaw pullers. This year, since the fundraising began in the middle of this month, up to the 26th, a total of silver 326 taels, 2 mace, and 5 fen, and foreign currency 9,532 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen have been collected from various sectors. As in previous years, donations often continue to be sent in after New Year's Day. Benevolent individuals in this city who still wish to donate are requested to send their donations to the North China Daily News office on the Bund.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau to Convene Meeting of Film Merchants Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau yesterday approved a letter from Wu Yan, a standing member of the film censorship committees of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior, requesting the convening of a meeting of film merchants in this city. It has been decided to hold the meeting at 2:00 PM tomorrow (Thursday, the 29th) in the auditorium of the Education Bureau, to foster relationships, exchange opinions, and facilitate progress.

<h3>Le Zhenbao Escapes Kidnapping; Is Thin and Weary</h3>
<p>Le Was Bound All Over When Rescued</p>
<p>Nine Men and One Woman Captured in Bandit Den on Hart Road</p>
<p>Five Men and Two Women Further Arrested on Waterworks Street</p>
<p>Le Zhenbao, a Ningbo merchant in his sixties, has lived in Shanghai for decades and enjoys a high reputation among the Ningbo community. He owns the Taichang Furniture Company at 580 Nanjing Road and resides in his own residence on Yuyuan Road, where he keeps a car for transportation. On the morning of the 10th of this month, when Le was going to his company as usual, as his car approached the alley entrance, a group of kidnappers suddenly emerged from the roadside and abducted him. For nearly two weeks, there was no clue. Even in the last ten days, contact between the kidnappers and the family of the victim had been severed, leading to much speculation in society. It was widely believed that Mr. Le may have been harmed by the bandits, but this could not be confirmed. On the night of the 20th of this month, the French Concession police station on Rue Massenet discovered a telephone with suspicious gunshot sounds, and at the same time, contact between the kidnappers and Le's family ceased. Le's family was extremely worried, suspecting that the strange gunshot sound was related to Le's safety. However, rescue efforts continued unabated. To their surprise, the Old Zhabei Police Station received a tip the night before last that the kidnapped victim was being held in a bandit den at 911 Hart Road in the French Concession. Upon receiving the report, the head of the police station, along with all Chinese and foreign detectives, first contacted the special unit of the French Police and went to the address together at around 11:00 AM yesterday. They indeed captured nine male and one female kidnappers in the house, seizing three Mauser pistols, one handgun, and over five hundred rounds of ammunition. The kidnapped Le Zhenbao was rescued safely. However, Le's whole body was bound, and the suffering he endured in the bandit den was evident. When the detectives entered the house, one of the bandits attempted to escape through a window but was shot in the leg by a French Concession detective and captured. The bandit, named Wang Xiaoshizi, was immediately taken to the special unit and then transferred to the Old Zhabei Police Station. After the head of the police station interrogated each of them strictly, they confessed that other accomplices were hiding at 199 Waterworks Street in the French Concession. The police went to the address and arrested five more men and two women, who were taken into custody separately pending trial in court. The victim's family rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and found Le emaciated and exhausted. They immediately escorted him back to his residence. Reporters were unable to meet with him. As the police are still investigating this case, reporters were unable to inquire further. However, whether the strange gunshot sounds heard on the telephone were related to Le remains to be confirmed by Le in the future.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the groomsman, bridesman, and officiant all gave speeches. The guests elected Director of Education Pan Gongzhan to deliver a speech on their behalf. The ceremony was solemn and grand, marking a momentous occasion. It is said that using the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Hall, a revolutionary martyr, as a wedding hall is a first.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case Appeal: Defendants Retract Confessions</h3>
<p>Zheng Shiying and Others Dissatisfied with the Previous Verdict</p>
<p>Qian Zhaofu, a native of Wuxi, and Pu Wenting were kidnapped by bandits in the French Concession last year. It was not until September of this year that Jin Jiulin, a detective of the special unit of the French Police, and others uncovered the kidnappers Zheng Shifan, Zhang Jiancheng, Zhang Afu, Gao Ada, and suspects Lu Liangqing and Zhao Xingsheng. The six individuals were handed over to the Second Special District Court, where the police lawyer filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. Zheng Shifan and Zhang Afu were each sentenced to life imprisonment, Zhang Jiancheng was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment for each of two crimes, serving a total of twenty years, and Gao Ada was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment, with each being deprived of their civil rights. Lu and Zhao were found not guilty. It is now learned that the four convicts, Zheng and the others, were dissatisfied with the verdict and separately retained lawyers Zhao Zuwei, Wu Jingxiong, Qin Zemin, and Dong Yu to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court, upon receiving the appeal, summoned the entire case file, opened an investigative hearing, and concluded the inquiry. The High Court summoned the witnesses, Detective Zhang Ziying and Qin Youyu, and the victims, Qian Zhaofu and Pu Wenting, to the court yesterday afternoon. At 3:00 PM, Presiding Judge Zhou of the Criminal Court, along with Judges Guo and Zhu, together with Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. The police department was represented by lawyer Gu Shouxu. The defense lawyers retained by the appellants were also present. Court officials ordered bailiffs to bring the appellants from the detention center for questioning. Their testimonies were all changed from their initial confessions in the first trial. They denied the kidnapping and claimed they had been falsely accused, admitting only because they could not endure the torture, and requesting that justice be served. The hearing concluded at 5:00 PM. The court considered further investigation of evidence necessary and adjourned the hearing to a later date. The appellants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Record of the Meeting of the Pengpu Security Corps</h3>
<p>The Second Team of the Zhabei Pengpu Security Corps held a full team meeting at the team headquarters in Qiaoxing Lane, Datong Road, at around 3:00 PM yesterday. Approximately 100 people were present, including Team Leader Shangguan Rong, Platoon Leader Shi Yingfu, and section chiefs and team members from various defensive posts. After the customary rituals, the team leader first reported on the progress of events, followed by discussions on the following matters: 1) During the previous war in Zhabei, all team members retreated to Suzhou with the 19th Route Army, and their firearms were confiscated along the way. After the Japanese troops withdrew from Zhabei, the team headquarters prepared funds and sent personnel to the Wuxian District Office to retrieve a portion of Mauser pistols, rifles, etc. Upon inspection, the remaining firearms when the team retreated were all obsolete. With winter defense being critical and robberies occurring everywhere in recent days, carrying obsolete firearms for defense would not only be useless but also harmful. It was resolved to prepare a document and send Platoon Leader Shi Yingfu to the team headquarters, requesting that the funds for retrieving firearms from the Wuxian District Office be deducted from the winter defense funds. 2) The number of personnel on patrol each evening at 6:00 PM will be determined by the number of personnel at each defensive post, but there should be at least two to six people in each shift, rotating every three hours until 6:00 AM the next morning. In the event of local incidents, they will cooperate with the security team and the police. 3) Yang Xialing, a member of the Tangqiao District Security Corps in Pudong, previously opened fire while patrolling at night and killed Jiang Guohua, a petitioner police officer from the municipal government, when checking pedestrians. Although the case has been handled by the Shanghai Local Court, a verdict has not yet been reached. Upon receiving letters from various sectors in Pudong requesting assistance, the team decided to express its support by waiting for the court's verdict, first sending someone to comfort Mr. Yang, and then preparing a document to submit to the Reorganization Committee, seeking assistance. Finally, other matters were discussed, which were not of significant importance and were omitted. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM.</p>

<h3>Souls Under the Wheels</h3>

The body was released to his brother, Huang Quan, for funeral arrangements.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Issues Notice on Tax Exemption Standards for Handwoven Cloth</h3>
<p>Technical Improvements in Handwoven Cloth</p>
<p>The Standard of the Sixteenth Year of the Republic Is No Longer Applicable</p>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau issued a notice to the Business Tax Collection Office of this city, forwarding a directive from the Executive Yuan, based on a joint submission from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, regarding the standard for uniform tax exemption for handwoven cloth. The directive stated, in brief, "Based on the instructions, the standard for handwoven cloth set by the Hubei Province, regardless of whether it is made of natural-colored cotton yarn, foreign yarn, or woven by hand looms or iron looms, is uniformly limited to three feet in length and one foot two inches to one foot six inches in width. It is further reported that the submission is based on the precedent for handwoven cloth tax exemption prior to the sixteenth year of the Republic, which seems to refer to the standard for handwoven cloth set by the former Beijing government in the seventh year of the Republic. However, currently, handwoven cloth has undergone considerable technical improvements to meet social needs, which often conflict with the previous standard. Since various regions have followed your esteemed Yuan's clear directive to exempt handwoven cloth from business tax, the exemption measures also vary greatly and should be unified for compliance. Having consulted with both ministries and considered the precedent of the seventh year of the Republic and the supply and demand of handwoven cloth in various regions, a new standard is proposed: 1) It must be woven by hand-operated looms, hand-pulled looms, or foot-operated looms. 2) It is limited to plain weave and twill weave, but striped or checkered plain weave or twill weave are included. 3) Whether it is handspun yarn or machine-spun yarn, the single yarn must not exceed 20 counts, and the double-strand yarn must not exceed 16 counts. 4) There are no restrictions on width or length. 5) There are no restrictions on original color or dyeing. The above five items are proposed to be submitted to your esteemed Yuan for review and to be circulated to all provinces and cities for compliance, without the need to follow the six tax exemption standards for handwoven cloth set in the seventh year of the Republic. All reasons for the directive to review the Hubei Province's standard for handwoven cloth should be followed. Whether this is appropriate, we respectfully submit this document for review and instructions, etc. It should be approved and circulated for compliance."</p>

<p>The Company Will Conduct Direct Negotiations Today</p>

Chinese directors such as Yu Qiaqing are prepared to take the lead in trying to mediate.

<h3>How to Solve the Problem of Coexistence Between Men and Women - Mr. Li Junsheng's Question</h3>
<p>I am not qualified to talk about the issue of coexistence between men and women. Logically speaking, although I am in my twenties, I have never been intimate with a woman in this charming and colorful Shanghai. Therefore, I consider myself unqualified to discuss this issue. When I say this, the general readers may scold me for wanting to eat cold pork head, pretending to be a moralist, but that is not the case. To be honest, I am a little timid. Why? First, I am just a small employee in a foreign firm, with a monthly income of only forty or fifty dollars. My monthly expenses are roughly as follows: rent eight dollars, food twelve dollars, transportation five dollars, nanny for cleaning toilets and washing clothes two dollars, barber and washing three dollars. My family has an elderly mother, and I have to send at least ten dollars or so every month. In this way, "the money is earned with sweat," and there is no surplus at all. If you get sick, take medicine, and hire a doctor, there is no way out, only one pawn (verb) pawn (noun!). This is still a minor illness. If a major illness comes, first, it will drag on for days, and problems will arise in the company. Second, medicine is so expensive that it cannot last, not only will the illness not get better, but there will be no food to eat, and there will only be one way to die. There is no need to think about the problem of men and women. Second, my experience warns me not to get involved in this issue. Because a relative of mine was a returned student from the West, and had a doctorate in literature. However, he was too loyal and did not know how to "drill holes," and his strange ideas were out of date. Therefore, although he had good qualifications, solid knowledge, gentle temperament, and a bright and upright attitude, I often thought that if I were a girl, I would desperately love him and help him succeed in a kind of learning, but he was ultimately "cheated" once because of a woman! His spirit was greatly hit. The thing is like this: there is a new-style woman, the so-called "fashion" girl, she is not only a modern girl on the surface, but also has been to the most modern school, to the most modern place, and also holds the most modern signboard in her thoughts. When she had not found other more suitable men, she once combined with my relative, the Doctor. My relative bought her fur coats, high-heeled shoes, and socks for two dollars a pair. He never put his feet in the game of lust, but for her sake, the Doctor had to often accompany her to the Paris Ballroom, the Central Grand Theater, and the Carlton. This modern girl seemed to be satisfied temporarily. However, "the sky has unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have misfortunes and blessings." His friend was sued in Hong Kong, and the Doctor, eager to help others, immediately ran to Hong Kong to rescue his friend, and this modern girl took the opportunity to go to Beiping to visit relatives. By the time the Doctor returned from Hong Kong, he found that the house was empty and there was no news. After a long time, he learned that this modern girl had met a more agreeable man in Beiping, who was not only rich but also an official, and often ate "champagne!" with foreigners. You think, even my Doctor relative, who is such a person, is inevitably deceived by a modern girl. What qualifications do I, a small employee, have to deal with those modern Misses? I can only sigh! However, people are always made of flesh, and they always have sexual problems. After finishing work, he feels the loneliness of the world, and in social situations, he feels the loneliness of life. This is really a painful thing! I am lucky that your reporter has taught me!</p>
<p>Answer: Reading your letter, my heart is pounding. I hate that I am not God, who can create thousands of affectionate and kind women in the seven days of creating the world, so that "all lovers in the world can become married!" However, this is just a joke, not a solution to the problem. The following is "getting back to the point." 1. Your salary is low, to be honest, you are not qualified to marry a modern Miss. If you want to "a toad wants to eat swan meat," then you are not only "climbing a tree to catch a fish," but also "doing nothing good, but harming yourself." Don't be delusional. If a modern woman really patronizes you, then you can only learn to "sit in meditation like an old monk" and close the door to visitors. 2. Don't panic when you hear this. This is not teaching you to really become a monk and cut off worldly ties. "Heroes still seek in the grass." Find a loyal and simple woman in the dust or in a small family to be friends with, but be sure to find a way to avoid childbirth. 3. The incident of your relative Doctor is a common occurrence in modern society, and is not surprising. Modern women are products of urban life. In modern society, they pursue the entertainment of one-sided material life all day long: dancing, movies, modern clothes and shoes, the trembling and temptation of the flesh, the pursuit of money and power. This is an inevitable phenomenon of "leisure society," that is, a few who have superficially received a little new-style education, or even received revolutionary education. These women are even worse. They are just "hanging sheep's heads and selling dog meat," and satisfying their carnal desires under the smokescreen of mechanical materialism, not "purely hedonistic" materialism. They also often say a few theories that are "donkey lips not matching horse mouths," what "freedom," what "oppression," and even what "ism," to defend themselves. In fact, they are "the drunkard's intention is not in the wine." Their purpose is very simple, that is: "enjoyment! enjoyment!" This is not an accidental thing! It is the phenomenon that a group of owners in the real society is declining day by day. Let us take this opportunity to give them a death knell!</p>
<p>The fall of modern women! Fall! Fall quickly!</p>

<p>Letters</p>
<h3>Letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I have read a dispatch from Wuhu in your newspaper on the 25th of this month, which briefly stated that the long-distance buses on the western section of the Jing-Wu Road have been approved by the Anhui Provincial Department of Construction and will be open to traffic on January 1, 1933. Although the eastern section has also been submitted by merchants to organize a company, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction has been picky and unwilling to sign a contract, resulting in the failure of traffic between the two places, which not only hinders transportation, but also seems to violate the intention of building the road. The western section of the long-distance bus company has reported to the Provincial Chamber of Commerce to submit to the Anhui Provincial Department of Construction for consultation with this department to quickly recruit merchants to undertake the project to facilitate transportation. This department has approved the application of Shi Yudian, director of the Preparatory Committee of the Jing-Wu Road Eastern Section Long-Distance Bus Company, and deputy directors Wang Yaojiu and Sun Haimin, to operate long-distance buses on the eastern section of the Jing-Wu Road in accordance with all the methods of the Anhui Provincial Department of Construction, and is currently negotiating the draft contract. Shi Yudian, the director of the Preparatory Committee of the company, also stated that since the route includes the area under the jurisdiction of the Beijing Municipal Government, can a terminal be set up within the scope of the municipal government after business begins? If it is necessary to divide the boundary, the starting point should be Andemen in Jiangning County, which is far from the city, and business will definitely be affected. In addition, the original share capital is not much, and funds are needed everywhere for purchasing vehicles and equipment. If the municipal government allows the establishment of a station, or it is necessary to prepay donations and taxes, I am afraid that it will be difficult to turn around. At this time, if the share capital is increased, it is also the time when the abolition of the lunar calendar is not far away, and finance is extremely tight, and it is difficult to raise funds. For the sake of prudence, Yudian and others have repeatedly gathered all the colleagues to consider in detail, and they all believe that it is impossible to handle. If it delays the future, it is better to stop the process to avoid future troubles. It is reasonable to declare the situation and ask the director to approve the cancellation of the case to end the matter. The case has been approved for cancellation. The eastern section of the Jing-Wu Road Long-Distance Bus is that the merchant himself is unwilling to undertake it, and it is not that this department is picky and unwilling to sign a contract. The reports of the western section of the long-distance bus company are inconsistent with the facts. In addition to finding another way to recruit merchants to undertake the project, and informing the Anhui Provincial Department of Construction for investigation, the corresponding letter is requested to be published in your newspaper to clarify the truth. Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, December 26.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>Chen Bu Lei Talks About Education Reform By Following the Trend</p>
<p>Rumors That I Will Head the Ministry of Education Are Inaccurate</p>
<p>Chen Bu Lei, member of the Central Committee and Director of Education of Zhejiang Province, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Chen at his residence yesterday to inquire about his views on education reform and the recent situation in Zhejiang Province. According to Mr. Chen, the modern education system does need to be reformed. Mr. Chen Guofu proposed a very practical education reform plan at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee. However, this plan is not an improvement plan, but a revolutionary plan. The current school system must be completely changed. Therefore, it cannot be realized in a short time and must go through a considerable preparation time before it can be implemented. The Jingdian [Beijing Telegraph] rumor that I will head the Ministry of Education is completely inaccurate. I will stay in Shanghai for about two or three days and then return to Hangzhou.</p>

<h3>Opening of the Shandong Education Bureau Chiefs' Meeting</h3>
<p>Jinan, 26th (Telegraph) - The Provincial Education Bureau Chiefs' Meeting of the second session opened this morning, the 26th. The Director of Education, He Siyuan, chaired the meeting and reported on the progress of education in the province over the past year. The number of primary school students has increased from 670,000 to 1,090,000. However, a major mistake in past education was that education was separated from the occupations of those receiving it and could not support production. In the future, reforms should be carried out urgently. The first step is to passively enable those receiving education to be content with their existing lives, and the second step is to actively enable them to assist in household production. In the afternoon, a discussion was held.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>A Sincere Appeal to University and Middle School Students Nationwide to Practice National Salvation Through Education (7) by You Huaigao</h3>
<p>(7) Universal Rural Education</p>
<p>Method: It is said that China has 1,911 counties, approximately 1 million villages, with an average of 500 villages per county, including 100 large villages. Now, let's start with the large villages. If each county has 200 university or middle school graduates who, after graduating, spend a year teaching the children of farmers in the countryside, at least 30 million children could immediately receive education. Each county has 100 large villages, and 2,000 counties have 200,000 villages. If each village has two teachers teaching 150 children, that's 30 million children. As the number of university and middle school students increases each year, the number of teachers will also increase, so the number of children receiving education will also increase. On the one hand, university and middle school students will voluntarily implement education, starting the trend. On the other hand, the government will raise educational funds widely and promote education. Five years later, among the tens of millions of educated rural children, at least several million will be qualified to become rural teachers. Ten years later, education can be popularized. This is the method of popularizing education.</p>
<p>Responsibility: When I go to the countryside and see farmers in coarse clothing and simple food, even farmers lacking food and clothing, I don't feel particularly sad because this is the result of our ancestors not knowing how to educate farmers. However, when I see countless innocent and lively young compatriots surrounding me, I feel very sad because if we still don't think about teaching them, they will grow up to be the poor farmers of China in the future. Therefore, we have a great mission and responsibility towards this group of children.</p>
<p>Career: Look at the remoteness of the northwestern provinces, and then look at Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet, Xikang, Qinghai, Suiyuan, and other places with large amounts of undeveloped land. If there are traces of university and middle school students everywhere, then your careers will never end. This is a very large task for you beyond rural education. Therefore, you are also creators of opening up wasteland and relocating farmers. Furthermore, the major domestic banks are currently trying to circulate a portion of their capital in rural areas, and the government is also working hard to use economics to solve the decline of rural areas. Therefore, after you arrive in the countryside, you will be financial agents. So, in the countryside, you are not only a teacher, military advisor, doctor, and engineer, but also an agriculturalist, economist, politician, and creator. The countryside is a single cell, and you are the nucleus of life in that single cell. In the future, the preservation and development of that cell depends on you. To put it simply, you are the village chief of a village because it's not just about teaching a few primary school students to recognize characters and read a few books, it's because other responsibilities are extremely important. This important mission cannot be fulfilled by ordinary rural teachers, so I specially and solemnly ask university and middle school students nationwide to take on the role of teachers. I am still afraid that their knowledge is insufficient, so I want to ask specialized talents nationwide to organize associations to broadcast teaching materials and implementation methods daily via radio.</p>
<p>Hope: Therefore, the policies of national salvation that you previously paraded and shouted for in the cities can be transformed into a policy of national salvation that educates and progresses in the countryside because the audience in the cities, even if they are enthusiastic and patriotic, is only a temporary emotional impulse, which ultimately becomes empty. Because they are not your believers, they cannot absorb your profound meanings. Therefore, I ask you to return to the countryside to cultivate your believers who can truly sacrifice for the country. If every university and middle school student can cultivate ten believers, after five years, the country can obtain millions of young vanguards for national salvation. I am afraid that at this time, you will find the filth and ugliness within the concessions to be disgusting and terrifying, and you will be willing to build your new-style Peach Blossom Spring, a scientific and electrified small Shanghai, with your believers and your lovers according to your ideals. This is my sincere and earnest hope for the success of your future in rural education. You are still in your youth or prime of life, and you can still see the ideal Republic of China that you have created with your own eyes.</p>
<p>Success: Therefore, the realization of this ideal and the success of this career depend entirely on you holding a sacrificial spirit of sacrificing for the country, a patriotic spirit of enduring hardship and adversity, a humanitarian spirit of a religious figure, and an adventurous spirit of an explorer. With this spirit, you can save the country, you can resist foreign aggression. Going to work in the countryside, you will have hardship to endure, you will have adversity to taste, and only then will you get the true meaning of ten years of accumulation and ten years of education. This educational service should be regarded as serious as military service, and the current important work should be regarded as urgent as facing the enemy in a serious battle. The farmers are treated as beasts of burden, suffering injustice. You should be their ladder, helping them ascend to the ranks of the masters and share human happiness. You should respect their parents as your own parents, and love their children as your own children. You must solve their livelihoods, and you must relieve their hardships. You must at least temporarily forget about rewards and say goodbye to money, forget about all the glory and wealth. You must know that this is our rare and evil era, this is our critical moment of life and death. We are currently few in number and weak in strength, and we are being bullied by others. Therefore, we must go separately to call for reinforcements, and we must spend ten years cultivating them, cultivating them to be worthy of being our national salvation helpers. As for the bandits in the interior, they were never born to be bandits. They were originally good farmers, so you must not have a timid and hesitant heart. You should accept the guidance of the association and the success of the government, which is also the success of national salvation through education.</p>

<h3>Results of the Boy Scout Aircraft Fundraising</h3>
<p>First Fundraising Exceeds 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Aviation General Organization to Continue</p>
<p>The City Boy Scout Council, in view of the importance of aviation to national salvation, originally scheduled to mobilize on December 3rd and 4th to raise funds for the Boy Scout aircraft. However, the municipal government instructed the City Boy Scout Council to postpone the event because the Aviation General Organization was not yet ready. Therefore, the first fundraising effort has temporarily come to an end. Statistics show that more than 2,000 members were recruited and over 3,166.07 yuan were raised.

The practitioners, such as judges and lawyers, were all dressed in official attire. The layout of the court was no different from the real court layout of the court, and famous figures in the Shanghai legal community and newspaper reporters were invited, including Ying Shi, President of the Shanghai Second Special District Court, etc. All the circumstances during the practice could be handled in accordance with the litigation, especially the debate between the lawyers on both sides, which was even more exciting.

<h3>Brothers in Hardship: You You Draws Again with Westerners</h3>
<p>| Result: Three to Three |</p>
<p>You You Held the Advantage in the First Half</p>
<p>The Shanghai Football Club (S.H.C.), once a team with a cloud of talented players and a commanding presence on the Shanghai scene, has seen its strength sharply decline in recent years due to the passage of time, the retirement of talent, and a lack of successors. This year has been the worst, with a persistent decline that is truly disheartening. Today they meet the You You team, promoted from Group B to Group A. Each team with a record of seven losses and one draw, they are at the bottom of the Western League table. The once draw was created at the beginning of the Western League, which was the battle against You You (the result was three to two). Yesterday, the two teams met for the second time at Yiyuan, and the result was a three-to-three draw. These two teams can be described as brothers in hardship in this year's Western League.</p>
<h3>You You Dominated the First Half</h3>
<p>With the third bell, the athletes of both teams started fighting in the cold wind under the command of He Chunhui. You You, in one fell swoop, stormed the enemy camp. Shen Baigui dribbled the ball, took a peek from the side, long passed in the field, Sun Hupei passed the ball back in front of the gate, Hu Youcheng got it, and he succeeded in one fell swoop. As a result, the vigor increased and the vertical and horizontal were unimpeded. Shen Baigui forced a corner kick, the kick was excellent, and Xi Qiaosheng crossed over and brought the ball into the door again. After losing two goals, the Westerners quickly resisted, and the yellow-haired Bao Deheng, full of ambition, pressed forward step by step. Within ten minutes, Huang Mao headed a ball and shot a ball, creating a 2-2 tie. The competition situation became more and more tense. The Western forwards are brave and formidable, and the You You athletes did not show weakness, and they were energetic. Efforts to resist and the walls are deep and strict, with no chance to take advantage of. Sun Hupei then counterattacked from the periphery, short-passed and jumped forward with Hu Youcheng and others, and ran to the door. Sun touched it with one kick, and he made a great contribution again. You You took a 3-2 lead in the first half.</p>
<h3>Total Result: Three All Draw</h3>
<p>You You dominated each time, and it seemed possible to try the Imperial Guard and open the winning record for the first time, so each athlete worked hard to strengthen the work. After the start of the second half, they fought for more than ten minutes without any achievements. Suddenly, Huang Mao saw Huang Mao's anger and the anger reached the sky. He led the army and invaded our territory, rushing left and right, and it was unstoppable. You You's goalkeeper Liang Guanlian was caught on both sides, and it was too late to respond. The ball came like raindrops. Regardless of his dexterity, there will be a failure. After a long time, Cole quickly made a contribution and returned, creating a 3-3 draw. Since then, You You has still sought progress, and each attack, the Westerners are unwilling to give up and compete with each other, and the situation is still extremely tense. Huang Mao (Bao Deheng) and Big Cat (Sun Hupei) each showed their skills, but unfortunately they missed the opportunity one after another, and there was no achievement.</p>

<h3>The Final Act of the Lu Winter Ball Games</h3>
<p>Jingcheng Team Retains Football Championship</p>

<p>(Jinan Correspondence) The Shandong Winter Football and Basketball Games have concluded with Boai winning the men's high school basketball championship, Zhengyi Junior High School winning the men's junior high school basketball championship, and Donglu Junior High School winning the men's junior high school football championship.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Massage</h3>
<p>— Ms. Lu Yin</p>
<p>It's Saturday afternoon again. Xiao Bo leaned lazily on the sofa, looking at the bright autumn sun outside the window, and said to his wife in a crooked voice, "Oh, this boring life is really too boring."</p>
<p>"Do you want to go somewhere to play?" his wife asked softly.</p>
<p>"Yes, ah, you think someone has worked for six days, and it's not too uncomfortable if you don't find a way to enjoy it on Saturday afternoon?" Xiao Bo still said complainingly.</p>
<p>"Then where are you talking about going?"</p>
<p>"I want to go see dancing."</p>
<p>"Of course, it's okay to watch dancing, but neither of us can dance. It's not very interesting to be a fool there!"</p>
<p>Hearing his wife's words, Xiao Bo felt even more unhappy, and quickly sat up straight, saying in a more serious tone, "You're always like this, you don't want to go here, and you don't want to go there. We don't get along very well on this point. I extremely like activities, but you are like a rotten log, wanting to hide at home all day long. Alas. We simply don't get along very well."</p>
<p>Seeing Xiao Bo's red-faced and bulging-necked appearance, his wife felt a little uncomfortable, so she said with a sneer, "Originally, it's rare to find someone in the world who can be the same in everything, unless one of them completely erases their personality and takes other people's interests as their own, and takes other people's will as their own. This way, they can be the same. Otherwise, even twin brothers born to the same parents will have some minor differences. It's natural to be different, what's so strange about it!"</p>
<p>"I think we should go our separate ways every Saturday in the future!" Xiao Bo thought for a while and said this.</p>
<p>"There's nothing wrong with that. I never want to force you to spend time with me. If you think I sometimes hinder your behavior, then just do as you please!" his wife said somewhat angrily and went downstairs. So, a beautiful autumn afternoon passed sadly in their anger.</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, Xiao Bo returned from teaching at school... It was already late, and his wife quickly approached and asked, "Why are you coming home at this time today?"</p>
<p>"Oh," Xiao Bo responded absently, and leaned on the sofa to think deeply.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you, acting so strangely?" his wife said with a smile, while stroking his forehead with her hand, "Are you sick?"</p>
<p>Xiao Bo raised his eyelids and looked at his wife with those dreamy, mysterious eyes. After a long, long time, he said in a low voice, "I'm very sad today... There's something I didn't want to tell you, but it's uncomfortable to keep it in my heart, so I'll tell you anyway!"</p>
<p>"What is it? Tell me! You don't have to hide anything from me!" his wife said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Yesterday, I went to a massage parlor!"</p>
<p>"Why go for a massage, are you sick?"</p>
<p>"You're really a fool, would someone who is sick go to a massage parlor to die?"</p>
<p>"Then what do you do at the massage parlor?"</p>
<p>"I went to have fun."</p>
<h3>Excluding Geniuses</h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>I don't want to quote the views of the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso, who sees geniuses as a kind of mentally ill person, a kind of madman whose mental powers are not balanced, and should be excluded. Geniuses should be excluded, not because they are mentally ill and can be given some leniency, nor because they are not mentally ill and should be praised. The only reason is that geniuses are different from us ordinary people. In our vulgar society, we don't need any geniuses, so we want to exclude them.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people in our society are mediocre people, ordinary people, absolutely not geniuses in any aspect. We mediocre people have our own way of life, our own path, and we don't need geniuses who are different from us mediocre people to guide and lead us. Geniuses only know their own way of life and the path of geniuses, which is useless in our vulgar society. We no longer dare to hope that everyone will become a genius and use the way of life of geniuses and take the path of geniuses. It is an unforgivable mistake for ordinary people to take the path of geniuses.</p>
<p>In fact, the history of this kind of mistake is too long. In the past, our mediocre and foolish ancestors followed geniuses, forgetting their own path. Geniuses took it upon themselves to be the leaders of the masses, and the masses seemed to be unable to move an inch without a genius leader. This error lies in the fact that the masses do not take their own path but take the path of geniuses. The masses forgot that they had their own path and followed geniuses to conquer the country, seize the world, and support a tyrannical emperor, sacrificing millions of lives and heads. The successful ones are geniuses, the sacrificed ones are the masses, so we can know that the masses have not done what they should have done. On the contrary, the farmers who till the land and the craftsmen who build houses, although they have not built any great achievements, give us food and houses, and we are truly blessed.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to recognize what our common people need? What we want is not the title of chief or committee member, nor amazing achievements and feats, let alone certificates and commendations. What we want is nothing more than a peaceful life, enough food, clothing, and shelter. We do not hope for complete enjoyment, nor do we want to see compatriots who are naked and starving. We cannot all be rich and powerful, so we do not hope to be. We are mediocre people, and we are satisfied if we can all have the same life. We want to exclude those who, like geniuses, hope to sit above the masses. We absolutely do not hope to be better than others, to stand out from others. The guideline of our ordinary people lies in universal equality.</p>
<p>If someone says that we have no ambition to improve, yes, that is the essence of the life of our ordinary people. No competition, no desire to be superior, no desire to abandon our own vocation, is the golden rule of our ordinary people. We take the smooth road, not the ladder to heaven. We do not seek honor, and we avoid humiliation. In short, we ordinary people can only do ordinary things, and cannot follow others to do things above ordinary.</p>
<p>Geniuses are different from us ordinary people. They have the ambition to improve, they want to climb to heaven, they want to lead a group of people to make great achievements, they want people to follow them for a great cause, but they are unwilling to do it alone. They often want to lure ordinary people to agree and support them. They want to blame ordinary people for not supporting him, not worshiping him, they want to enjoy the sacrifice of ordinary people, they want to suck the blood of ordinary people, they want to be the leader of ordinary people, but they do not give ordinary people the slightest benefit. Therefore, geniuses are the enemies of our ordinary people. We are ordinary people, and we want to exclude geniuses, whether they are geniuses at killing people, geniuses at plundering, geniuses at cheating, geniuses at boasting, or even geniuses at eating and shitting, we must exclude them.</p>

<h3>Random Jottings from Wuxiang Hermitage</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>Last night, I read Tang Yuansu's "Chronicle of a Journey to the West in the Gengzi Year," which recorded a Boxer Rebellion incantation: "First bow, the gates of heaven open; second bow, the earth's portals crack; third, summon Sun Wukong; fourth, summon Zhu Bajie." It is said that this incantation was very effective, and a young child who possessed it could defeat a strong man. Another incantation to ward off cannon fire read: "Water freezes mountains, ice freezes caves, in the ice cave there is an ice man." All of this is bizarre and worthy of a chuckle.</p>
<p>It also records an essay, an argument, and a poem topic from Hong Xiuquan's imperial examinations: the essay topic was: "Confusing words from a crooked plate, red water floods the world, God's eternal covenant, the curved sun's teachings." The argument topic was: "Filial piety to parents, filial piety to grandfather." The poem topic was: "Seeking fish, one obtains Wu; like a starving man seeking rice and obtaining Rong. Five-character, eight-line verse, rhyme unrestricted." The "grandfather" in the argument topic probably refers to Christ, and the character "Wu" in the poem topic is suspected of being an error, but the essay topic is completely incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Kuang Zhouyi's Jinqian lyrics, Wanghaichao Jiang Jianxia assigned the topic of a portrait of a Japanese girl, Xiao Hua, with a note citing a Japanese proverb: "Shinshu buckwheat, lover's handsome face, not eating buckwheat is still alright, but missing my lover makes me worried," with a charm similar to reading Qu songs at midnight. I wonder what the original text was like.</p>
<p>When an author has a new book published, they often like to personally sign their name and send it to relatives and friends. French writers who are not in Paris, when they have a new book out, will include a business card with the inscription: "Respectfully presented by so-and-so, who is not in Paris," to make it clear that they were unable to personally sign it. As for the novelist Paul Morand, who travels the world, he would often print: "Respectfully presented by Morand, far from Europe." The president of the Writers' Association, Claude Farrère, recently gave away his new book, "L'Atlantique en rond," with a business card that read: "Respectfully presented by Farrère, who cannot sign by hand." It is said that when Gogoloff attempted to assassinate President Doumer, Farrère suffered collateral damage and his hand was injured, hence this unique presentation inscription.</p>
<p>Years ago, during the war between Qi and Lu, I took refuge in Shanghai and walked along Jing'an Temple Road at night, composing a quatrain: "A graceful jade moon rises, leaning on the vast and lonely army with a cold glow; late at night, it flows into Jin City, yet illuminates the dancing girls returning on Silver Street." Today, rereading it, I think it is quite suitable to be sung about the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Suzhou (II)</h3>
<p>— Zhenfu</p>
<p>We went further inside and saw many historical sites, including the Sword Testing Stone of the King of Wu, which is split in the middle, and the remains of Zhen Niang. Further inside, there is a sloping stone ground with various wrinkles on the stone, but no cracks can be found. This stone ground is about five or six zhang square, like a large stone, naturally formed like this. It is said that the tomb of the King of Wu is buried in the middle of the stone, which is of course a mythological folk legend. On the stone wall, there are large characters of "Tiger Hill" by Yan Zhenqing, with very majestic brushstrokes. Further in from the left, there is the so-called Sword Pond, surrounded by stone walls, with vines and wisteria winding around the stones. The water in the pond is dark green, and the sunlight can only penetrate through the branches and leaves of the vines and wisteria, so it is inevitably gloomy, as if one has reached the deep mountains where no one lives, and has become another world.</p>
<p>We walked to the top of Tiger Hill, where there are several new-style buildings, small bridges, cement roads, halls, pavilions, and so on. To the left of the new-style buildings, there are dilapidated walls and broken tiles, and a desolate ancient pagoda, with the golden paint peeling off, which has become a comfortable nest for birds. The new and old aspects complement each other interestingly. In addition, there are treasure halls, monks' rooms, and many imperial steles of Qianlong, which are commonly found in famous temples everywhere. When we came down from Tiger Hill, on the left side of the road, there was a cave made of stacked stones, said to have been built by Xi Shi to avoid the invasion of King Goujian of Yue. Such folk legends are actually taken seriously and built. The curiosity of the people of Suzhou can be imagined.</p>
<p>In Tiger Hill, there is also a kind of person who specializes in leading tourists, pointing out historical sites, and telling legends about them. Among these people, I think many folk legends must be preserved, although there is a suspicion that they have been embellished and fabricated. However, if someone can record them, it may be a good reference material for studying folk stories.</p>
<p>In Tiger Hill, we learned about the historical sites of Suzhou and how the people of Suzhou are fascinated by myths and legends. Tiger Hill is like a ruin of classicism, preserving many ancient relics, but at the same time, it is like a garden of romanticism, with many strange and bizarre legends behind these ancient objects. Originally, classicism and romanticism have a related relationship, because a fascination with the old easily leads one away from real life and into fantasy. This fantasy that deviates from real life easily carries a romantic color. Observing everything in Suzhou with this hypothesis may not be entirely correct, but it is not far off.</p>
<p>(III) To the Lingering Garden in the Setting Sun</p>
<p>We came out of Tiger Hill and took a car to the Lingering Garden. Along the way, desolate grass covered many tombs, and the tombstones were as dense as bamboo shoots in spring. The setting sun slowly went down, illuminating the clouds into various colors, setting off the distant mountain scenery, causing us to look around from time to time. In the sound of wheels and horses' hooves, everything seemed to pass by like scenes in a movie. Finally, under a few green trees, we arrived at the Lingering Garden. After paying the fare and buying tickets, we began to tour the Lingering Garden. When we stepped into the Lingering Garden, the first impression that caught our eyes was the complete map of the Lingering Garden. It was completely built according to the Grand View Garden in "Dream of the Red Chamber," and it can also be said to be a miniature of the Grand View Garden. It completely represents the ideal buildings of our country hundreds of years ago. It is like a beauty in ancient costume, without any of the current Europeanized habits. Its architecture is very exquisite, with winding corridors and winding stone paths. Everything is completely man-made. When we went inside, the first thing we saw was weeping willows and ancient trees with branches, a long wooden bridge, with bridge railings on both sides, and clear green water under the bridge. There are also mountain roads stacked with artificial rocks, winding and twisting, so although the area is not large, it is quite attractive. Outside the artificial rock road, there are many winding corridors and pavilions. The corridors are all made of square bricks, not very wide or very high, but therefore there is a quiet atmosphere. There is no strong sunlight to oppress you, only faint light penetrates in.</p>
<h3>My Sister's Love—Ms. Peng Xuezhen</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>I tell you, my sister has changed in the past six months. Look at her, she was always like a child, jumping and skipping like a bird on a branch. She had no worries or concerns, acting coquettishly in front of her mother and laughing innocently among her friends.</p>
<p>Growing up, she had naturally never thought about love. Nor had I ever imagined that my sister would be like any other grown-up girl, swept up in the waves of love.</p>
<p>It was in the depths of spring this year that my sister wrote to say: "Mom, I'm embarrassed to tell you, but Ke and I are getting engaged soon. We've known each other for a year, and our feelings are really good. Honestly, I never thought that the god of love would ever catch me. Lately, when I look in the mirror, I feel like I'm standing on the edge of youth, just like the depth of spring. But youth is fleeting and can never be recovered. Mom, don't make fun of me!"</p>
<p>I was stunned. I had never imagined that my sister would ever be immersed in a sea of love. I forgot that she was standing on the edge of youth. I forgot that Cupid's golden arrows are constantly being shot at young girls. In my mind, there was only the image of my sister's boldness and straightforwardness, but not a hint of a profile hiding in a lover's embrace, whispering secrets.</p>
<p>I smiled slightly.</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, worried about her mother, my sister reluctantly returned from the frontier in the scorching heat.</p>
<p>Ke in the photos was very handsome, kind of gentle, but couldn't shake off that particularly dignified air of Northerners.</p>
<p>"You two are really meant to be. I thought my sister would never be able to love anyone."</p>
<p>For the first time, I saw a particularly beautiful, shy blush spread across her cheeks.</p>
<p>To see my sister's embarrassed smile, all I had to say was something like, "Ke is thinking about you!" It was common for her to wait foolishly at the door for a letter, and when it arrived, she would turn it over and over for half an hour, reading it. When she was disappointed, she would pout and secretly scold the heartless postman. I really shouldn't have teased her so much that she didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and ended up chasing me around the yard to beat me.</p>
<p>In the evenings, while everyone was waving palm-leaf fans and enjoying the cool in the yard, my sister would always write letters to Ke alone upstairs.</p>
<p>"Go look at the stars! It's too hot under the lamp! Ha, what do you call him? Sweetie or darling..."</p>
<p>"You nosy ghost, it's none of your business!"</p>
<p>I would try to take a peek, and if she wouldn't let me, I would steal a glance at the scraps she had finished writing. She would scold me for being immoral, but I didn't care!</p>
<p>"I really can't figure out why, but I'm in a daze all day long. I'm afraid people will laugh at me, so I just pretend to be calm. As usual, my heart races when I read your letters. I'm really afraid of your sharp eyes, but I still have to read them again and again. I just hope the days fly by, and when the cool breeze blows away this heat, we can shake hands."</p>
<p>I don't know if the days actually flew by, but my sister finally left home eight or nine days earlier than planned, although everyone at the station couldn't help but have tears in their eyes.</p>
<p>In her letters, my sister often mentioned Ke, saying that he was a very loyal and lively child, and that she was happy.</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of the Era and Love (28)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Just when they were both away, the waiter brought the bill. Haiquan was embarrassed not to take it. He looked at it; it was only 2.46 yuan. Although he was a little reluctant, he felt the amount wasn't too much. He took his small wallet from his pocket, took out three silver dollars, and paid the waiter.</p>
<p>Cao Shiguang came back out from inside, smiling as he buttoned his pants. After sitting down, he poured himself tea and drank it without asking whether the bill had been paid. When he saw the waiter bringing the change, he pretended to be surprised.</p>
<p>"The bill's here? Let me pay… that won’t do… Lao Lin, sorry about that."</p>
<p>"It's nothing," Haiquan said, but he was still somewhat scornful of this religious man.</p>
<p>"Lao Cao!"</p>
<p>Mr. Liao staggered in from outside. He called out "Lao Cao!" then coughed for a while.</p>
<p>"Did you call him? What's the situation?"</p>
<p>"Cough cough! He's not home."</p>
<p>Haiquan looked at Mr. Liao's serious attitude, then at Cao Shiguang's smiling face. He suspected they had planned to trick him into treating them to this meal.</p>
<p>(XIII)</p>
<p>After leaving the restaurant, the three of them walked along the street on Wuma Road for a while. Cao Shiguang stayed close behind Liao Haifeng, whispering incessantly. He seemed to have forgotten that Haiquan was walking behind them. Seeing them having eaten their fill, wiping their greasy mouths, and ignoring him, Haiquan felt exceptionally indignant, and a feeling like being abandoned in the desert by his companions arose.</p>
<p>"Lao Cao!"</p>
<p>He called out to Cao Shiguang from behind. However, Cao Shiguang only turned his head to look at him, his face showing a doubtful expression, as if asking Haiquan why he was calling him.</p>
<p>"I'm going back."</p>
<p>"Isn't it nice to walk around?"</p>
<p>"I have schoolwork tomorrow."</p>
<p>Haiquan's voice was unhappy.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry, we've really bothered Mr. Lin today."</p>
<p>Liao Haifeng said, stepping forward to cup his fist at Haiquan, his intention seemed to be hoping Haiquan would leave them quickly, because Haiquan's intuition was very sharp. He was genuinely angry with them, but he forced himself to endure it. He only nodded at them and turned to walk towards the bus stop. He only took three or four steps when he suddenly heard Cao Shiguang chasing after him, calling his name. He quickly stopped.</p>
<p>"Lao Lin, I'm really sorry about today…"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he hooked his arm over Haiquan’s shoulder, acting like one of the young hooligans on Fourth Horse Road.</p>
<p>“…you ended up spending a lot of money. We'll treat you another day."</p>
<p>"It's nothing."</p>

<h3>Public Bond Futures Rebound by 7-8 Jiao</h3>
<p>February Futures Have Opened in Several Varieties</p>
<p>Trading Suspended Today Due to Futures Settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 27th), the market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were still scarce, with only 14,000 yuan changing hands for futures on the entire day. February futures have officially begun trading. For example, unified salt tax, 20-year bonds, demobilization, and troop reduction bonds have all been opened, but unified tax and salt tax bonds were traded more actively. The January futures market was still good, and buying and selling were not deserted. The trading volume was over 2.7 million yuan in the morning market and 3.8 million yuan in the afternoon market, totaling 6.57 million yuan. As for the trend of various bonds, prices had fallen sharply in recent days. Furthermore, the diplomatic situation with Japan was not as serious as previously rumored. Financial institutions in the local area were still mostly engaged in acquisitions. As a result, market sentiment slightly stabilized. Apart from sluggish opening prices in the early morning, prices then fluctuated and strengthened. The afternoon opening was the strongest, but the closing price turned loose again. As a result, the prices rebounded by about 7-8 jiao compared to the previous day. However, spot prices for salt tax, 20-year customs bonds, long-term financial bonds, and small 19-year customs bonds had no trading in recent days, so their prices fell quite sharply compared to before. The bond market's situation appeared chaotic again. Also, the market was suspended today due to settlement.</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Shows Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>｜Relying on the Strength of the Cotton Market｜</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market shows a slight recovery, with raw cotton prices remaining firm, causing some speculators to be bullish. However, in reality, there are still no good signs. Looking back at the domestic situation, it is extremely urgent. Moreover, the world's commerce is in a slump. How can the market have a large rise? Therefore, some manufacturers still hold the doctrine of buying when prices rise, but at present, with the help of the cotton market, there may be a small temporary increase in hope.</p>
<h3>Near-Month Yarn Slightly Better by 3-4 Qian</h3>
<p>Opening on the Renbiao front market, following the momentum of the cotton market from the previous day, it rose by 2, 4, and 5 qian. With the second and third markets lacking buyers, the market fell again. As a result, each month rose by 2, 3, and 4 qian. In the afternoon, hearing that actual demand was sluggish, the market atmosphere was again tired. However, the general intention of speculation and absorption was very strong. Each month fell by 2 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 24,400 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 3,100 bales, Gengfeng 1,000 bales, Shenji 650 bales, and Yiyu 500 bales. Tongfu bought 1,250 bales, Dafu 1,350 bales, Yukang 950 bales, Gu Da 700 bales, Hengchang 1,300 bales, and Yuantai 550 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Surges in the Morning, Falls in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>｜Ultimately, There is Not Much Change｜</p>
<p>Cotton prices rose sharply in the morning and fell in the afternoon. The short squeeze of this month's cotton was the most severe, but the result was still a peaceful situation. In fact, the overall situation is calm, yarn sales are sluggish, and factories are less interested in receiving high-priced cotton. However, some speculators, seeing that factories have not purchased foreign cotton this year, believe that there is a cotton shortage, and are wholeheartedly inclined to buy and go long. The market situation is tight. As for foreign cotton, it is currently difficult to calculate due to the impact of exchange rates. However, the difference is still about two taels (the spot price of American cotton middling is 29 taels and 1 qian in the American silver market), plus 7 taels for shipping to Shanghai. This is the raw material that can be spun into 32-count yarn.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Shows Slight Discrepancies</h3>
<p>Opening in the Zheng Biao front market, due to the lingering effects of yesterday's short squeeze, the buying side aggressively pursued, and the situation was very sharp. Each month rose by 2 and 3 qian, and then fell back again in the second and third markets. As a result, each month rose by 5 fen to 1.5 qian. In the afternoon, since this month was the last day, the second and third markets were very expensive, and the closing price fell by 1.5 qian. Distant months followed suit, and each month fell by 1.5 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 134,300 dan. It was found that Shenxin Chun sold 3,300 dan, Changyu 3,300 dan, Tonghe 3,600 dan, Gengfeng 3,000 dan, Shenji 4,700 dan, Dachangcheng 2,400 dan, and Yichang 2,300 dan.

<p>津花紗市一束 Tianjin Flower and Yarn Market Summary</p>
<h3>Xihe Cotton Market Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>(26th) Tianjin News: The Xihe coarse cotton market revealed a rising trend. After Shenxin Factory in Shanghai absorbed 10,000 bales, the market was shaken. Most buyers were unable to get close, and there was a slight pause. Later, Western merchant Golim Line bought 200 bales at a price of 24 taels. Other transactions amounted to 550 bales, with opening prices ranging from 24 taels 2 qian to 24 taels 5 qian, a sharp increase of 5 qian compared to before.</p>
<h3>Xihe American Cotton Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The same day, Tianjin News: The Xihe American cotton market atmosphere is becoming increasingly firm. Shen merchant and foreign merchants have strong appetites. Yong'an Factory bought 200 bales, with an opening price of 29 taels. Foreign merchants bought 400 bales with an opening price of 29 taels 1 qian.</p>
<h3>Donghe Long-Staple Cotton Remains Stable</h3>
<p>The same day, Tianjin News: The Donghe long-staple cotton market situation remains stable, but sales are slightly slower than before. Yesterday, Yong'an Factory bought 320 bales with an opening price of 29 taels 7 qian.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Remains Strong</h3>

<p>Grain</p>
<h3>Out-of-Province Rice Sales Boom, Spurring a Rise of Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were not many out-of-province indica rice arrivals, and even fewer out-of-province Yuan rice arrivals. However, the Min Province merchants were actively purchasing, and their appetite was extremely strong. Although hoarding households stopped, market prices rose instead. There is not much out-of-province Yuan rice stored in Shanghai, and the quality is better than Du Yuan rice. Furthermore, it can be directly transshipped. Therefore, the Quanzhou and Fuzhou merchants from Min Province continued to purchase actively. However, the Shanghai inventory had already been purchased by the Min merchants, and there were not many new arrivals. Yesterday, a small number of Wuhu Yuan rice arrived and was completely purchased by the Min merchants. The inventory was also being scoured. A total of 901 bales of Wuhu machine-milled Yuan rice were opened, with prices jumping from 10 yuan to 10 yuan 3 jiao and a half, then further to 10 yuan 5 jiao, a large increase of half a yuan compared to the opening price of the previous day. The prices of indica rice from Jiangxi and Hunan were also driven up by several fen to nearly a jiao. It is recorded that 580 bales of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice were opened, with prices ranging from 8 yuan 5 jiao to 8 yuan 4 jiao and a half. 620 bales of Hunan machine-milled oil rice were opened, with prices ranging from 8 yuan 9 jiao to 8 yuan 6 jiao 7 fen. 260 bales of Hunan machine-milled Jing rice were opened, with prices ranging from 8 yuan 4 jiao and a half to 8 yuan 1 jiao and a half, all purchased by the Quanzhou and Fuzhou merchants from Min Province.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Rises in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>｜Short Covering... Very Good Actual Sales｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally calm after opening in the morning, with no reports from the foreign wheat market. However, industry insiders believed that the supply of current flour was not abundant, so they remained firm on keeping prices high.  Huafeng slightly reduced its offer, and the market seemed stable. Due to a lack of selling from various factories in the forward market and strong buying interest, market sentiment was quite good. In the afternoon, the market became even more active.  Short covering was necessary for the current month due to only half-day trading, leading to gradual price increases.  The forward market also saw step-by-step increases due to strong interest from actual sales customers. Regarding the current flour situation, Fuxin had already sold out, and Hezhong had no stock. Fufeng, Shenren, Xinda, and Huafeng all directly charged standard prices without adding extra.  Whether prices can be stabilized will depend on the smooth import of foreign wheat. In the end, the current month was up by 0.02 yuan from the previous day, January up by 0.015 yuan, February up by 0.01 yuan, March up by 0.0175 yuan, April up by 0.01 yuan, and May up by 0.0075 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Situation Stabilized</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about 30 suppliers, and the stocks in the wharves were not abundant. City and rural stores were sluggish, mainly due to tight monetary conditions. All anticipated looser conditions.  Superior japonica rice prices continued to fall by 0.01 yuan. Early and late rice arrivals were also connected. Sales in this area remained weak, with some interest from Tianjin. Market prices were slightly adjusted. Superior Dujian rice was in short supply, and prices rose by 0.015 yuan.  Yinhua rice arrivals were moderate, and retail sales were not weak.  Liquor sellers were active but hesitant. Market prices remained unchanged.  Bianyuan rice was scarce, resulting in a lack of market activity.</p>
<p>(Xinzha) Yesterday, there were about 36-37 suppliers, but the outbound flow remained sluggish.  River accumulations were still heavy. Limited high-quality northern japonica rice was offered, and bulk prices fell by about 0.01-0.02 yuan. Early and late rice arrivals and sales were both weak. The Bianyuan rice market lacked activity.  The trend of Dujian rice from other ports showed signs of improvement. Daily sales totaled around 3,000 shi.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Temporarily Shows Signs of Easing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market generally remained stable.  Due to the halt in foreign wheat trading, transactions were few.  Furthermore, current auctions are for far-term deliveries. Given the scarcity of domestic wheat, future deliveries will likely be difficult. The only hope lies in foreign wheat. However, various factories are unable to deliver due to tight flour supplies. The tightness in January is mainly due to this.  However, a ship of foreign wheat recently arrived and berthed at buoy number 7. It is said to be destined for several small and medium-sized factories, about 8 or 9 in total (excluding Xin and Fufeng).  Unloading has been ongoing since yesterday. If more shipments arrive subsequently, the wheat market may temporarily ease. In the end, January was up by 0.012 yuan, March remained unchanged, and there was no comparison for April and May.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Oil is in Short Supply, Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oilseed and miscellaneous grains market saw further improvements compared to the previous day. Outbound flows for various suppliers remained strong. Small soybeans were actively purchased by local factories, and prices increased by a few cents. Doudou soybeans from Guangdong also saw good outbound flow, and prices rose by 0.05-0.06 yuan, leading to increased activity in the soybean market. Transactions included 220 bags of Pudong Doudou soybeans, 300 bags of Pinghu Doudou soybeans, and 100 bags of Chongming Shayellow soybeans, all purchased by Guangdong suppliers.  Additionally, 278 bags of Jiangbei yellow soybeans, three cartloads of Zhengyangguan yellow soybeans, and 1,200 bags of Andong Shayellow soybeans were purchased by local factories. Outbound flow for various sesame seeds was also good.  170 bags of Linhuaiguan flower sesame seeds were sold to foreign firms.  Eight bags of Jiujiang milk sesame seeds and twelve bags of snow sesame seeds were purchased by Fuzhou suppliers. The peanut market showed some improvement with good outbound flow. 400 bags of Qinhuangdao peanuts and 45 bags of Tancheng peanuts were sold, all to Guangdong suppliers. The oil market saw a sharp rise in vegetable oil prices. Soybean oil prices remained stable. Vegetable oil prices rose due to shortages and strong outbound flow. Initially, prices remained flat, but they soon soared by 0.04-0.05 yuan. The main reason for this was the lack of available stock. The destinations were mainly local merchants and suppliers from Quanzhou and Xinghua.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Fresh Chaoqing Sugar Arrives Today</h3>
<p>Totaling 2,200 Bags</p>
<p>Medium Granulated White Sugar Opens at 14.8 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained stable. The association's auction of common grade coarse granulated white sugar opened at 15.85 taels, but suppliers from Huai only offered 15.825 taels. The two sides held firm, and no deal was made. Several hundred bags of No. 8 Dutch Red sugar were auctioned at 11.7 taels, later rising to 11.75 taels, an increase of 0.05 yuan from the previous day. No. 18 Medium Granulated White, Huaxin goods, had been consistently maintained for days.  Yesterday, they achieved their goal, opening with 1,000 bags at 14.8 taels. The remaining balance of Fresh Chaoqing sugar was 300 bags. Yesterday, they were fully sold. High Grade Blue opened at 9.05 taels, High Half South Blue at 8.7 taels, followed by 8.6-8.55 taels. According to a telegram from Shantou, the Yisheng ship had already departed from the area, carrying a total of 2,200 bags and expected to arrive this morning.</p>
<p>North-South Goods</p>
<h3>Quanzhou Dried Longan Supply Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>The remaining stock of previous batches of Quanzhou dried longan is nearing depletion. Since costs must be covered, subsequent batches will be scarce. According to a telegram yesterday, only slightly over 700 boxes were shipped and should arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Old Factory Silk Sales Are Not Weak</h3>
<p>Sales of white factory silk to Europe and America have declined sharply. Old silk stocks are abundant, and silk prices have plummeted. Recently, inland silk factories have been using new-style silks for both domestic and international sales.  Seeing that old factory silk prices have fallen to the lowest levels and native silk is of poor quality and labor-intensive, they are switching to factory silk to weave high-quality linings, spring hair fabrics, etc.  The overall cost is still considered worthwhile. Therefore, since the beginning of autumn, inland silk factories have purchased a total of 1,753 bales of old factory silk in Shanghai. Besides being shipped back to their respective factories, 296 bales of old factory silk purchased by various silk factories remain in Shanghai warehouses.</p>

<h3>Reply to Mr. Li Weinian's Letter</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Your letter states that recently, the respect for teachers has declined, and the academic atmosphere is turbulent, which is a hidden concern for the future of education. Recently, I read two articles in your publication, "Tomorrow's Paper is Due" and "Small Hall Name." The content of these articles not only insults teachers but also greatly damages students' character. Such records are not something your publication should include.</p>
<p>"The decline of respect for teachers and the turbulence of the academic atmosphere" is indeed as you said, worthy of a great sigh. However, my opinion differs slightly from yours. You believe that such writings should not be published to prevent further decline and turbulence. Your intention is to hide the flaws and prevent them from being exposed, which is indeed a motherly heart. However, this publication publishes such writings to encourage people to correct their mistakes if they have them, and to be more cautious if they don't. It is intended to promote good and punish evil. Therefore, although our goals are the same, our views differ.</p>
<p>"The decline of respect for teachers and the turbulence of the academic atmosphere" did not start today. Assuming that this publication does not publish such writings, the respect for teachers will not decline, and the students will not be turbulent. Now, publishing these writings does indeed have the risk of tempting students to fall and commit crimes, which is something we should not do. If such writings are not published, and the respect for teachers has already declined, and the students have already become turbulent, then the reasons for their decline and turbulence are very complex, and I will not elaborate on them here. In short, this publication will never dare to take responsibility for it.</p>
<p>However, because of this, I want to study the general psychological state of students. Is it inherently good or inherently evil? When this publication records such writings, do students consider it a disgrace and a loss of student character and improve, or do they consider it novel and pleasing, and consider it worthy of emulation? Assuming that students consider it a great disgrace and a loss of student character, and there is nothing that can be done to improve them, then I have nothing more to say. If students consider it a great disgrace and a loss of student character and warn each other not to commit such acts in the future, then what this publication has published may not be an intention to promote good and punish evil. Although I dare not claim credit for it, I can indeed disclaim responsibility. Furthermore, since its reform, this publication has not only been like this towards the academic community but also towards all the dark secrets of society. It has spared no effort to expose them and describe them, fighting to the death with the dark secrets. This is also its stance. It will never promote them further just because their secrets are not dark enough, adding another layer of color to them. Hiding evil and promoting good is originally the attitude of sages. Not washing dirty linen in public is originally a bad habit under the patriarchal system. Now, we want to use another method to break through all the dark secrets and all the bad habits, leaving them with no foothold. We are unwilling to continue condoning evil and covering up mistakes, specializing in putting on a show, while the inside is still dark and the outside is still civilized. This is the pain that China has suffered for thousands of years and the cause of corruption accumulated over thousands of years. My humble opinion is such. I wonder what you think of it, sir?</p>
<h3>A Farmer's Words</h3>
<p>— Guangxin</p>
<p>With several friends, taking advantage of the warm sun, I went for a walk in the suburbs. Accidentally, I came to the front of a village with thatched and tile houses. I saw a farmer in his forties, alone beside a field of green and yellow vegetables, talking to himself like a madman. We were very curious, so we approached him and began to ask him questions.</p>
<p>"This year's grain harvest is very good. This year, bandits have not patronized this place either. This is probably because the heavens have pity on you. You can have a comfortable year this year!"</p>
<p>"Sir, how do you know our suffering? We can't even think about a moment of peace or a full meal, let alone a comfortable year!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, his "brows were furrowed," showing a pitiful appearance, and he sighed a long sigh!</p>
<p>We asked him in surprise, "What is the reason for this?"</p>
<p>"Sir, the bandits in the past few years have made this place a mess, unable to cultivate. Last year's floods washed away all the houses. These years of misfortune have left me with a debt-ridden body. The interest rate is four or five percent, and the interest is calculated on top of the interest. In less than three years, it has already exceeded one and a half times the principal. This year's grain harvest is relatively good, but the price of grain is really cheap. The people who are demanding payment come to the door to urge me every day, forcing me to have no choice but to carry the grain to the nearby market town to sell it. The general business owners ignore you. After you ask annoyingly, they turn around and say very pretentiously, 'How much money do you want?' Poor me, I am also very hungry, my spirit is also tired, and I have no energy to speak. At this time, I have to answer respectfully... 'Listen to you, sir!' Then he will say very vigorously... 'Yesterday, the market price of grain was two yuan, three jiao, and five fen per shi. Today, it will fall by two jiao and five fen. Are you willing?' At this time, I am in a dilemma and have to sell the grain. One shi of grain sold for two yuan and one jiao of foreign money, and it takes a day's work. It turns out that it only sells for more than one yuan. At this price, it is not even enough for half of the cost of cultivation. Even if all of this year's grain is sold, it is not enough for this year's interest! And my family has seven mouths to feed. Where can we have a full meal? The bandits of the past few years and the floods of last year have forced us to flee to the famine far away. Therefore, the land taxes of the past few years have not been paid off. Unexpectedly, during this year's autumn harvest, the county sent more than a dozen soldiers as fierce as wolves to the countryside. Their mission is... 'To collect all the arrears and pre-collect the new grain.' As a result, my soul was lost in fright, and I couldn't speak for half a day. Those fierce-looking soldiers said very viciously... 'You hurry up and get money to pay for our travel expenses. Each of us wants eight jiao of foreign money per day. If you wait until tomorrow, you will have to pay even more. Hurry up and get it...'</p>
<p>Poor me, I was forced to cry at the time, and I couldn't say a word.</p>
<p>They said even more viciously... 'The officials are not afraid of your poverty, and the ghosts are not afraid of your thinness.' What's the use of crying? We just want money anyway.</p>
<p>At this time, I had no choice but to go to the neighbors on the left and right to borrow money. I didn't know that they were in the same boat as me and had to prepare money to pay for the soldiers' expenses. Their men had all gone out to get money, and several women were in a panic at home. I had no choice but to come back. They | the soldiers, then roared... 'Where is the money!' At this time, I said in a trembling voice, 'No...' Before I could finish speaking, I was hit on the head several times. At this time, my wife and children saw this situation and cried loudly. I couldn't help but cry loudly too! In the end, I had to sell my fifty-yuan plow cattle for twenty-seven yuan of foreign money in pain, and used more than ten yuan to pay for the expenses of the soldiers | the soldiers, and even killed a breeding chicken for them to eat before they left. When they left, they said with strange eyes, 'You have to pay off everything within three days, otherwise we will come again!'</p>
<p>Sir, our grain and rations, accumulated over the years, require more than thirty yuan of foreign money to be paid off. Where can I get it within three days?</p>
<p>At this time, if I die! Then the whole family will perish together! If I live! I'm afraid I won't live long!</p>
<p>When he said this, he couldn't help but shed tears again.</p>
<p>In our hearts, we couldn't help but shed tears of sympathy.</p>
<p>"The rural economy is bankrupt," "Farmers are crying bitterly," How would we know their suffering? As for those important people who live in foreign-style houses, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>We also have a considerable understanding of the saying that "Oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger."</p>
<p>This farmer's words, I came from my hometown | Hunan, the real situation, but yesterday I went to Wuxi with a friend, this kind of "economic bankruptcy" situation is almost the same as ours | Hunan, with emotion, I drafted this article.</p>
<h3>A Jin</h3>
<p>— Wenbing</p>
<p>A Jin was originally a farmer's daughter, growing up in the countryside. She had her own peaceful world, and she also had her own imaginative life.</p>
<p>In the spring, early in the morning, she would lead a strong water buffalo, stepping on the bright, dewy grass, to the hillsides and open fields to graze. She had no feelings for the beauty of nature. She just led the cattle to eat grass. Others sang folk songs, but she didn't sing, and she even pretended not to listen. She really looked like a country girl.</p>
<p>Summer came, and she had to do other farm work. Although her feet were bound, her legs were still strong. In June, she did water-pumping work, and she was almost as good as a young man in his twenties.</p>
<p>Autumn was also very busy. When harvesting rice, she had to take on part of the rice-cutting work. After that, all the rice straw from dozens of acres of fields</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>was collected by her two hands and piled up in the empty space in the back garden.</p>
<p>Only in winter did she have relatively more free time. In fact, not really. Every day, in addition to helping her sister-in-law cook and make tea, she would shut herself in her room all day long spinning yarn and weaving hemp. Because she was not young anymore—she was already sixteen years old. On the third day of the third month, she had been betrothed to Liu Axi, whom she often thought about. Precisely because of this, she not only felt that she was gradually changing physically, but her mind was also obviously different. The most obvious thing was that she had her period every month… When she had nothing to do, she would always sit there blankly in a daze. Usually, Xiangda next door would flirt with her and even touch her hand, but she didn't feel anything… But now, she no longer tolerated such actions from Xiangda. She thought it was an act of insulting women. If a woman tolerated such an insult, then that woman was simply not a woman. However, she was full of yearning in her mind for what a fun life it would be!</p>
<p>She kept secretly inquiring about the news of her marriage, but it often disappointed her, and Axi had gone to the city to work instead. She heard that it would take a long time before he could bring her over to get married. She thought… "Why be so slow?"</p>
<p>From then on, she fantasized more and more about the scenery in the city. Xiangda had also told her that Li Siye from Ao had been to the city once and said that he didn't need to cook. When he was hungry, he could run to a restaurant to eat… He didn't need to rent a house. He could spend the night in a hotel… It was especially convenient to go out. He could take a rickshaw, a tram, and even a fast-moving car… There were also… what kind of cars to take… When it came to playing, there were endless good things to say. There were shadow puppet shows to watch, live tigers to see, and the Great World had giant tortoises that were thousands of years old to see. Sometimes, there were conjoined twins preserved in medicine on the side of the road to see. There were also people who were taller than a zhang, and there were also people who were only two chi tall. In short, the good things in the city were ten thousand times better than in the countryside, A Jin thought.</p>
<p>But she also had doubts and dissatisfaction. That was that there were groups of women who would go out to find men to play with in the evening… Those women were simply not women. It was rare to find them in the countryside. Therefore, she didn't quite believe Xiangda's words about this, thinking that Xiangda was deliberately lying.</p>
<p>However, the city should be good overall. Axi went to the city to work. Wasn't he happy and fortunate?</p>
<p>Axi's cousin, Guisheng, was originally her buffalo-herding friend. Because she and Axi were engaged, Guisheng often came to her house to play. Her parents didn't guard against him, because he was the younger brother of her future son-in-law. Sometimes, she would talk and laugh with him generously and casually. Once, Guisheng said to her… "Big brother is having a lot of fun in the city. I want you to go to the city to play too!" When she heard this, she was shy at first, and didn't commit one way or the other. Later, she thought to herself… "Wouldn't that be good? If he takes me there… Anyway, I really want to see Axi's face!"</p>
<p>So A Jin eloped to the city with Guisheng.</p>
<p>Just that Guisheng was smart, he took her to a different city.</p>

<p>The weather was cold. Miss Wang opened a box and looked at the box full of winter clothes. She said coquettishly to Old Master Wang… "Dad, I don't like the leather coat I made last year anymore. Give me two hundred yuan so I can make a new one."</p>
<p>"What? You want to make another coat? Do you know how many you already have? How much money did you spend in total?"</p>
<p>"How could I not know? I only have eight leather coats in total. Each one costs an average of one hundred and sixty yuan, which only costs more than one thousand and two hundred yuan. What's so rare about that?"</p>
<p>"Humph, you've already spent more than one thousand yuan on coats alone. Isn't that rare? Besides, the leather of your coat is very good, and the foreign wool lining, which costs more than three yuan a foot, is also the best you picked. How can you just put it aside after wearing it for only one winter? This bad habit of liking the new and disliking the old is not only undesirable, but such waste of resources is even more sinful…"</p>
<p>Old Master Wang was giving a long lecture, saying a few words of righteous instruction. Unfortunately, Mrs. Wang in the inner room heard it and defended her daughter… "What do you mean by wasting resources? A daughter like her, born into a family like ours, don't say just one coat that costs two hundred yuan that has been worn for a winter, even if she wears several in a winter, it's not a big deal. You can't bring money into the world when you're born, and you can't take it with you when you die. How can you, such a wealthy father, be so stingy?"</p>
<p>Old Master Wang couldn't argue with his wife and daughter, so he had to sign a check for two hundred yuan in pain and went out to the office reluctantly.</p>
<p>Before the gate was closed, three patriotic youths walked into the house, holding bamboo donation tubes and donation registers. They bowed to Mrs. Wang and said… "The weather is cold, and the borders are bitterly cold. The birds and beasts have hidden away. It is pitiful that our volunteer soldiers who are fighting the enemy for the country are still wearing their lined clothes and fighting hard in the icy and snowy fields. There is an urgent need for winter clothes. Please, madam, be generous and donate some money."</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang retracted her loving smile towards her daughter and replied coldly… "Since the volunteer soldiers lack winter clothes, who told them to risk their lives with the Japanese in the cold and windy northeast? Even if they freeze to death, what does it have to do with me? At this time of the year, when the economy is difficult, we are worried about freezing and starving even after economizing on food and clothing. Who has the spare money to donate to them?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang's attitude of rejecting people from a distance actually "didn't cost a penny" and issued an "order to leave" as if to chase the three patriotic youths out.</p>

<h3>Marriage Problems That Cause Sleeplessness and Loss of Appetite</h3>
<p>Editor Sir,</p>
<p>I am originally a child from a village forty or fifty li away from Shanghai. My family is very poor. My father is a peddler in Shanghai—selling vegetables. My mother plants five mu of rented land in the countryside. The family's expenses all depend on my father's hard support. Living in such a difficult environment, I naturally did not have the opportunity to receive a proper education. So I helped my mother farm and make a living. But how can I maintain it for a long time on these few mu of rented land? Moreover, agriculture has been on the verge of bankruptcy in recent years. Later, through the introduction of my father's friend, I worked as a worker in a printing factory in Zhabei. During the unprecedented disaster of the "January 28th Incident," that printing factory was also sacrificed in the artillery fire of Japanese imperialism. Therefore, I lost my job as a result!</p>
<p>This summer, after thinking of all kinds of ways, I finally got introduced by a relative to be an apprentice in a store, and the bread problem was temporarily solved.</p>
<p>Recently, my family suddenly started to make a fuss about my marriage. I was betrothed to a girl from the same village by my parents when I was young. My mother's letter said… "…I am already fifty years old. I am old and weak, and I am about to die. I want to marry you off and finish this wish of mine. I think at the latest when you are nineteen years old, I will definitely marry you. Moreover, there are few people in the family, so it would be good to marry one back earlier to help me with my work. In case I get sick, there will be someone to take care of me. What do you think?"</p>
<p>When I received this letter, I really couldn't make up my mind. Although I am only seventeen years old and have two years to consider, should I agree to do this? Or how should I refuse? I have three difficulties…</p>
<p>㈠ The usual apprenticeship period is three years. I will not be a fully qualified master in two years, and my personal finances will not be sufficient. How can I afford it…</p>
<p>㈡ If I write back to refuse, then my elderly parents will definitely be sad. If they get sick from worry, how can I face them…</p>
<p>㈢ How can I rashly marry a woman I have never met? If I get married, can we grow old together?</p>
<p>This problem has been lingering in my mind for dozens of days. Just when I was wandering and restless, I suddenly saw the "Shop Clerk Correspondence" column in your newspaper, which is dedicated to solving difficult problems for us. Therefore, I also want to trouble you to give me a perfect gospel.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Xu Zhan</p>
<p>Editor's note: Xu Jun, at the age of seventeen, can be so aware of the hardships of life and is afraid of making his parents sad, so he does not dare to answer rashly. We don't need to put out the signboards of moralists such as "the decline of social morals" and "filial piety is commendable." We also want to express our infinite admiration for Xu Jun.</p>
<p>Now, there are countless people in Xu Jun's situation… I believe that there are also many who feel the same difficulties as Xu Jun. Therefore, we will make it public and attach our humble opinions for everyone's reference.</p>
<p>First, if you cannot afford it financially, it is of course better not to marry. But now, when women's employment is gradually expanding, women can generally make a living on their own and do not have to rely on men. Those with higher knowledge can be teachers or staff in various companies and institutions… Those with lower knowledge can also work in factories… or do sewing work on the streets… or wash clothes for others… They can use their abilities anytime and anywhere to exchange for the cost of living. However, you must understand the times and know that a life earned by hard work is sacred, and you must never think that it is "embarrassing."</p>
<p>At the same time, you must work hard in your job and never be pessimistic. You can naturally gain a position slowly. Read more books and newspapers in your spare time, and you can improve your knowledge. In the future, when you have a suitable opportunity, you may be able to engage in a better career.</p>
<p>Second, in the letter to your parents, you may as well gently state your difficulties and ask your parents to inquire whether the other party | your fiancée | has the ability to make a living. It would be even better if she does. If not, it is still possible to learn now. The timing can always be discussed. We think that you can temporarily not refuse, so that your parents can get some comfort.</p>
<p>Third, now, except for the intellectual class, most people still have old-fashioned marriages. Facts tell us that the results of absolute "freedom" are not necessarily perfect. This is probably because the parties involved are too enthusiastic when things happen and their judgment is too weak. We might as well change it a little now. Since it was your parents who betrothed you when you were young, you may as well take an opportunity to meet and talk with her, or continue to correspond, to see if she can be your lifelong partner. If there is no opportunity, then you can entrust your close friends in the countryside to visit her and ask about her character, whether she is gentle and kind, and whether she can endure hardship. If she is a very good woman, it is possible to "grow old together." And it can save a lot of trouble. If, after the investigation or meeting, you find that you are not satisfied, then you should resolutely make up your mind, tell your parents the pros and cons in front of them, and discuss the proper way to handle things. We know that parents always love their children. As long as they can help their son succeed, there is nothing they will not try to accommodate.</p>
<p>In short, parents marrying a daughter-in-law for their son is for the son and not for the parents themselves. Therefore, if the son firmly opposes it, the parents should give it the greatest consideration. That is the right thing to do.</p>

<h3>Sympathizers (Continuation 7)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>(4) Both Sides Sympathize</p>
<p>After a few sentences of conversation, Meng Guobao already knew that starting with principles was futile. Wang Laoer certainly didn't understand them. Even if he explained them in a refined and simple manner, he still wouldn't get it. To understand their suffering, one couldn't use objective methods to probe. It was better to ask him directly and let him speak for himself. These words shouldn't be followed by immediate explanations; one should wait and speak slowly later. Seeing Meng Guobao silent and not saying anything, Wang Laoer twisted the mouthpiece of his dry tobacco pipe in his palm for a moment. From a betel nut pouch hanging on his waistband, he took out a pinch of yellow tobacco shreds, pressed them onto the pipe bowl, then held the pipe stem with both hands, presenting it to Meng Guobao with a smile, "Have a smoke?" Meng Guobao said, "I don't do that." Wang Laoer smiled, "You're truly a wealthy man." He then put the pipe mouthpiece into his own mouth and puffed away, making "pu-ji, pu-ji" sounds. Then he shouted, "Bring a fire! Has the tea been brewed yet? The guest has been here for so long!" He raised his voice a little, facing inward, of course. This was speaking to the one who was tending the stove because that's how it was in Chinese families: when the man spoke loudly, it was to call his wife and daughters; when the woman spoke loudly, it was to call her husband. This was a foolproof method. The Second Sister-in-law came out in response to this shout. She carried two duck-egg-colored rough porcelain bowls in one hand and a tall-handled tile teapot in the other. As she stepped out of the doorway, she saw Meng Guobao squinting at her and called out, "Mr. Meng." She then retreated two steps. Wang Laoer put down his pipe, took the teapot and bowls, and poured tea into them. Because there was only one bench by the low table, he retreated backward, leaning against a stone mill frame, holding the rough porcelain bowl in both hands like a monkey holding a peach, with his mouth pointed towards the rim. Meng Guobao watched him pour a bowl of tea and place it on the edge of the table in front of him. Judging by the color, the tea was as yellow as horse urine, with many tea leaves forming a layer at the bottom of the bowl. The tea was steaming hot, with tea vapor rising into the air. Sniffing the vapor, it had the scent of green grass. Seeing Wang Laoer drink it with such relish, he also took a sip. It was both astringent and bitter, and seemed to have a salty taste. He immediately put the teacup down. Wang Laoer saw this and asked with a smile, "You're not used to this kind of tea, are you?" Meng Guobao smiled and said, "What's there to be unaccustomed to? You're a person, and I'm a person. If you can drink it, then I can drink it too." Wang Laoer understood these words and said with a smile, "Mr. Meng is really good. Not at all pretentious." As he spoke, Second Sister-in-law Wang leaned against the door frame leading inside, with one foot raised and resting on the threshold. Although her head was lowered, her eyes kept falling on Meng Guobao. When Meng Guobao occasionally turned to look at her, she lowered her head even further. Meng Guobao initially paid no attention to her and said to Wang Laoer, "It's not that I'm not pretentious, it's that I've thought things through. We're all people, we should all wear the same clothes and eat the same food. That's the right thing to do. But things in this world can't be that way. And the people who do the least work are the ones who eat the best and wear the best. Take farmers, for example. Some enjoy the good life, and some suffer. You're planting other people's fields. You should know how your rent and the landlord's share are divided, right?"</p>

<h3>From Japan to China</h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>On the world stage... undeniably, everyone recognizes film as a powerful tool for social education. However, culture is time-sensitive, and we can imagine that film will certainly be used as another weapon!</p>
<p>Our eastern neighbor has now implemented film diplomacy. The national slogans are: "Film politicization," "Film propaganda," and "Film militarization!"</p>
<p>From the September 18th Incident to the present, if we were to investigate the cinemas in Japan, probably more than half of the films are about the Northeast. What is said in these films is nothing more than the spirit of the Yamato soul, the bravery of the samurai, the corruption of China, the incompetence of the Chinese army, and the self-liberation of the people of the Northeast.</p>
<p>They know that they are immature in the world of film and have no status, so the government has issued very strict orders and provided considerable economic assistance to various companies. This has mobilized the entire nation to unite externally and promote the country. For example, several films sent to Geneva were provided free of charge, and they will be sent to various countries for free public screenings in the future. This small nation can see through the financial losses and seek international sympathy for Japan's invasion, blaming the Shanghai Incident entirely on China.</p>
<p>This grand alliance of the Japanese film industry not only cannot find an opponent in the Far East, but no film industry group in the world has such great momentum. It is truly an unprecedented event. According to a report from the Japanese Ministry of Education, companies that specialize in filming such films now account for nine-tenths of the total number of Japanese film companies. "Shin興", "Kansai", "National", "Fukuda", "Akazawa", "Tokyo Kawai", "Dainikatsu", "Yoshikawa", "Matsushita Kamata"... none of them are not among them, abandoning all other types of films and devoting themselves to the Sino-Japanese Incident. From September 18th to today, more than four thousand productions have been produced, and it is estimated that by September 18th, 1933, the total will reach the round number of eight thousand sets. The later generations of the Japanese nation will certainly eat the consequences of this crazy "war-making" movement. Many of the exterior scenes in these films are taken from the Shanghai war. The rest also use real scenes from the Northeast. As for the actors, in addition to the original roles of each company, almost everyone from the Emperor to the lower-ranking officers who invaded China has appeared on camera.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, what about us? The films produced are still about love, still about modernity, seemingly unaware of being oppressed, and that we should loudly call for saving the country through film. Occasionally, one or two films are successively made difficult by the Central Film Inspection Committee and the Concession Film Inspection Committee. In fact, what we have filmed is not even one ten-thousandth as effective as Japan's counter-propaganda.</p>
<p>I hope that our government and people will wake up! Arise in time!</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Gilded Love</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>In the minds of today's youth, there is nothing more attractive than two things: money and love. Then "Platinum Blonde," which premiered at the Cathay Theater yesterday, is a film title that caters to people's tastes.</p>
<p>Love gilded with gold, in other words... love based on money, everyone knows that it is bound to fail. This film exposes this very essence. There are also many places in this film that mock the trivialization, bribery, and debauchery of people in the news industry. It does not lie; in fact, there is no shortage of such bad actors in the press. It also provides an introduction, saying what kind of person is the ideal lover, husband, or wife in the eyes of the opposite sex, and the pain suffered by people who marry for money (especially men on the poor side).</p>
<p>The story is simply told, and everything can be included in two sentences: a poor reporter meets and marries a wealthy woman for an interview and becomes her live-in husband. Because of mental oppression, he divorces and willingly lives with another woman in a very poor family.</p>
<p>However, there are many branches added to the film, so the story is stretched out for a long time. It was originally an ordinary comedy, but everywhere... almost every inch of film... is full of small interest, constantly making people laugh. These interpolations are not annoying... completely humorous, but not tiring, but there are some places that are out of touch with reason because we cannot treat it as a slapstick comedy.</p>
<p>Among the stars, Jean Harlow, who plays the merchant's daughter, is the most outstanding. Nominally a supporting role, she is actually the protagonist. Her dignified and luxurious demeanor is generous but not vulgar, like a maiden in a boudoir who is deeply in need of a man. Robert Williams, a lively young man, reveals his personality with interesting small actions and words. How strange that the director demoted Loretta Young, who is very capable of performing, to play the other woman, and did not give her a chance to act alone, except for a long shot of the two writing together. However, using her as an important supporting role does add a lot of brilliance to this film. The remaining actors all have the ability to be humorous and amusing, coupled with wonderful music, which is dedicated to winning with noise... without any humor. It can be regarded as a unique style. The cooperation of light and photography makes the scenery very grand and beautiful.</p>
<p>Comparing the merits and demerits of the comprehensive aspects, the director can be regarded as superior, and meticulousness is his strength.</p>
<p>This is all I saw in the whole film.</p>
<p>In a Few Words</p>
<h3>Should There Be a "Break"?</h3>
<p>— Zongwen</p>
<p>"Should a ten-minute break be added halfway through a movie?" This question is often mentioned in front of my friends, and their answers are no more than the following three:</p>
<p>A. The break allows us to have the opportunity to savor the script and guess the outcome of the story, which is a very interesting thing. (Referring to not reading the synopsis).</p>
<p>B. A person's eyes must take a break after watching a movie for an hour! Otherwise, they may be harmed, which is a very hygienic thing.</p>
<p>C. A break on the screen is a necessary thing, but it must be at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Readers, do you think these reasons are sufficient?</p>
<h3>Two Platinum Dragons Mutually Exploit</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The "Platinum Dragon" film of the Southern Film Company is currently in production. Xue Juexian became famous with the play "Platinum Dragon", and the Nanyang Tobacco Company also produced a type of "Platinum Dragon Cigarettes". However, Shanghai people only know the cigarette name and do not know that it is also the name of a play. It is said that the Nanyang Company had a whimsical idea and intended to ask the Southern Company's film to insert the canned appearance of "Platinum Dragon Cigarettes". Negotiations are currently underway.</p>
<h3>Si Lang Visits His Mother on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>As an annual practice, old theaters close for at least seven or eight days, which is a pity for those who are addicted to opera. This year, Tianyi Company has filmed a sound film "Si Lang Visits His Mother", which is co-starred by the female lead Xue Yanqin and Tan Fuying. Sitting in the Palace, Stealing the Order, Crossing the Pass, Seeing the Mother, Crying in the Hall, and Being Allowed to Take Back the Order are performed for a total of six quarters of an hour, about eight thousand feet long.</p>
<p>Chinese stage plays have been brought to the silver screen. There is an American film "Dr. Mei's Tiger Assassination", which is an imported product. This "Si Lang Visits His Mother" is the first Chinese self-made film. The script promotes Chinese "filial piety," "credibility," and art.</p>
<p>This film was produced by Tianyi's newly established "Agency Filming Department", so it is not purely a Tianyi production, but has the nature of a commission. The total cost is 30,000 yuan, and Huang and Tan each received 6,000 yuan. The attached picture is as follows...</p>
<h3>Jeanette MacDonald's Little History</h3>
<p>MacDonald is currently the most popular silver star on the film scene. Her works are warmly welcomed everywhere. Her singing and beautiful face are so charming and glamorous. She is a newly discovered silver star in Hollywood. Since co-starring with Chevalier in "The Love Parade," she has become famous throughout Europe. Then she starred in "The Vagabond King," "Monte Carlo," and "The Merry Widow," and then she soared to the highest peak of the silver screen.</p>
<p>Her family history is also very ordinary. She is British and grew up in Philadelphia, USA. Her father was once an actor. She also has an older sister who is a singer on the Broadway stage. Because she was still young, she followed her father to school in Philadelphia. She was naturally intelligent and was praised by teachers. At the same time, she paid great attention to other subjects. At the age of eight, she participated in a grand local gala and performed singing and dancing, which was appreciated by general playwrights.</p>
<p>At the age of fifteen, she went with her father from Philadelphia to Broadway to visit her sister. Unintentionally, she was spotted by the discerning eye of the theater manager, who insisted that she stay in the theater as a singer. So she left school and embarked on the stage. After three years of hard work, she gained a place on the stage and many immortal reputations. At this time, movies were popular all over the United States, and the singers on Broadway joined the silver screen one after another. But she was willing to stick to the old and unwilling to innovate until sound films began in Hollywood, and the film industry went straight to Broadway to search for talents. Jeanette was also recruited by the great director Lubitsch. She first co-starred with Chevalier in "The Love Parade," followed by "The Vagabond King," "The Merry Widow," "One Hour With You," and "Love Me Tonight." Although she once joined Fox Company and filmed a "The Smiling Lieutenant," she soon rejoined Paramount. She is already a popular celebrity. Her fiancé is called (Bob Ritchie), who is a wealthy young man. It is said that they will be married soon.</p>
<h3>A Bundle of Tianyi News</h3>
<p>— Sheng</p>
<p>Since Tianyi Company filmed the entire "Si Lang Visits His Mother" Peking opera for the Gu Feng Film Company, due to the clear pronunciation and exquisite scenery, a film company in Guangdong contacted Tianyi, wanting to film a Cantonese sound film "Platinum Dragon". It is said that negotiations were successful the day before yesterday, and yesterday afternoon they started filming the "Garden Scolding" scene.</p>
<p>Tianyi's "Poetry on Banana Leaves" and "Two Girls in the Northeast" (i.e., Two Orphaned Girls in the War Zone), which have been filmed but not yet released, will soon be successively premiered at the New Light Theater. The plot, sound, scenery, lighting, etc. of these two films are all excellent. It is expected that when they are released, they will definitely cause a sensation.</p>
<p>Rare News from the Film Industry</p>
<h3>Tom Mix's Horse</h3>
<p>— Ziyin</p>
<p>Martial arts star Tom Mix. His best skill is riding a horse, so he rides his horse in every film. Therefore, Tom Mix's horse has also become very famous. Its name is Tony, which many people know.</p>
<p>But one point that careless viewers will be deceived by is that although Tom is still Tom, his horse has now been replaced by a new generation. Horses don't live as long as humans, so the person is still as strong, but the horse has declined. This king of horses, Tony, is now leisurely enjoying his remaining years in the pasture.</p>
<p>Its replacement is its son, who has inherited its mantle. It is a tall and majestic horse, completely like its father in its prime. Its name is called Tony Jr. Ordinary people only remember the name Tony, but they don't know that it has already had a replacement.</p>
<p>Speaking of old Tony's retirement from the film industry, half of it was because he was old and not as agile as in the past, and half of it was because he encountered an accident at the end. That was during the filming of "Hidden Gold," when old Tony was unfortunately injured in the buttocks. Tom decided to give this loyal companion, who had been with him for many years, a good rest.</p>
<p>It is not certain whether little Tony can fulfill his duties in the future. However, rumors have already risen, saying that little Tony is a bit "out of tune".</p>
<p>That is entirely due to a recent incident of falling off a horse. The thing is like this. When filming that day, the horses were side by side, so little Tony, Tom's new mount, accidentally stepped into a mud pit. Its strength was far less than its father's, so it rushed forward, knocking Tom down and hitting him on a nail pile, causing Tom to injure three ribs and several internal injuries.</p>
<p>This martial arts star has already undergone surgery by a doctor and will soon recover. He still trusts his little Tony, and he says that they will definitely be able to cooperate with each other. This accident was just the first time.</p>
<p>We hope this is also the last time.</p>
