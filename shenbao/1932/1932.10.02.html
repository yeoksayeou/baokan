<h3>如何而消弭内戰乎都良</h3>
<p>我國自革政而還以内戰頻仍之故國勢日即於陵夷。庫帑益形其竭蹶商。</p>
<p>業凋敝。民生憔悴吾人於椎心切齒之餘迄無術以戢軍閥之野心也。國難突臨。朝野震驚。徹上徹下爲義憤所驅使。謀團結之恊調。煥乎一振其泄沓頽靡之態度。揆諸生於憂患之義。誦乎鬩牆禦侮之詩似國是前途轉得藉此巨難以另闢一線之新生機最低限度。要亦不致再有内戰之發生譬駕輕舟而犯險濤。風雨交加傾覆是虞。使同舟之人。交勉互助。共策安全。則波浪雖惡猶冀全濟。若人各一心。内相譁擾。其不至載胥及溺者幾希。　瀋變迄今。已匝歲矣。外侮之乘。視前益亟。而内戰序幕。早已揭開。先之有二陳文綏於瓊崖。繼之有韓劉火併於膠東。今川中二劉。又以醖釀衝突聞矣棟。</p>
<p>折榱崩。未悟僑之將壓螳蜋搏蟬。不知雀伺其後。袞諸公。自非别具肺腸。夫何昧勢塞聰悖情蔑理至於斯極乎。</p>
<p>中央對魯變處置。尚未聞有確切之辦法。而制止川戰之謀猷。又在各要人焦心衝慮之中矣。石青陽亟亟調解。何應欽殷殷垂詢。軍委會去電調查。馬澤昭迨切陳詞。在在見各方對茲未來之禍變。已起嚴切之注意也。川將領雖有力求避免之表示。却未聞有絕不啓釁。之保障。若至無可避免之時。勢必不憚接觸絃外之音。會心非遠宜乎先識之士。爲之輾轉反側而不能自已也。　　彼呼籲和平者進行途徑。殆無不以當事之軍閥爲對象。而其立言之要旨又無不以國難爲勗厲。以退讓相敦迫。是雖日日稽首崩角於軍閥之馬前亦未足以廻其視聰何則。彼固以個人意氣利害爲前提。而勿有斯須國事安危之關乎其懷也。與虎謀皮虎其肯聽。吾人今亦唯有謀禠虎皮之一策耳皮之不存。則毛亦無所附著矣。曰禠虎皮奈何軍閥非有千手百臂能以一身自撑拒也。其所恃以爲利器者。部伍耳。槍械耳自師旅營轉以迄連排什伍。各有其長以資調遣。誠使此各級軍官。瞭然於天職之所在。而弗復與忍心禍國之軍閥相合作。則集團立趨於渙散。而軍閥失其所憑藉矣。吾人所當努力者。即在如何能使軍人得明大義。如何能使是非向背之宜傳。得深浹乎各級軍官之中心而已。或日。軍人以服從爲天職。信如所言。是重干紀律也。則直應之曰否軍人固以服從爲天職。而服從有條件也。軍人亦以保國衛民爲天職。保國衛民無條件也。今日長官發一令日杆禦外侮。則吾服從之。何則。慎禦外侮是保國也。今日長官發一令曰清剿土匪吾亦服從之清剿土匪是衛民也若長官以個人利害衝害故。以相互間意氣不洽故。而迨我洪其馳驅。則我可毅然表示不合作。何則。我固國家之干城。而非私人之爪牙也。如此。則軍閥且將瞠目結舌而莫知所以措。瓊崖之役。中山艦以不願參加内戰而翩然離港去已事之可徴者也。此種不合作態度。容或有乖常則。難以施諸平日。唯於國難當頭間不容髮之頃。而軍閥猶欲以内戰摧國脈吾人急切不擇手段亦只能爲此釜底抽薪之一舉耳。果能行之有方則不待中央之煌煌文告。不勞邦人士之奔走呼號。而内戰固已消弭於無形矣。</p>

<h3>全滬民衆狂歡邱飛海直落三戰勝德孚</h3>
<p>獲得本屆高級網球單打錦標</p>
<p>女子雙打錦標同時解决</p>
<p>轟動全滬之上海高級網球單打决賽、我國網球名家邱飛海以六比二·六比四·六比四·之直落三比數擊敗前屆錦標德孚、爭得本屆盟主之榮譽、邱氏之成功、固足慶賀、而國際上之光榮、亦得照耀一世矣、賽前尚有女子雙打决賽、克倫諾夫人凡格斯夫人以二比一勝勃登夫人柯拉沙小姐、比數八比六·五比七·五比七、</p>
<p>（一）宿願方了</p>
<p>邱飛海末幕光榮</p>
<p>邱飛海自歸國顯身於網球舞臺上以來、最初卽與林寳華奪得遠東運動會從未獲有之網球錦標、而中國網球界之逐漸勃興、邱氏與有力焉、頻年邱氏雖無卓著戰績、然尚能保持原有技能、與世爭抗、但自顧黄金時代行將他去、乃於告别下野之前、作一番驚天動地之舉、而爲其一生光榮歷史之結束、本屆上海高級單打開始、邱氏適於時前來滬、執拍入伍、屢建勲績、初以直落三勝史密斯、再以直落三挫江道章、前週複賽三比一敗林寳華、昨日决賽、又以直落三克德孚、在羣英會中、一躍再躍而終居首蓆、前恥旣雪、而宿願又了、有志竟成、邱氏誠網球界之人傑矣、顧一般景仰邱氏者、熱烈盼望邱氏以其一身所得、提掖後生、造就新進、則其有益於國家、固匪鮮矣、</p>
<p>（二）甘拜下風</p>
<p>德孚雙手奉冠冕</p>
<p>加拿大台維斯杯選手德孚、賴其天賦之身高臂長、及專擅之供攔二道、横行滬濱、稱霸海上、去歲遇邱氏於高級單打、勝而獲得冠軍、本屆决賽幕中、舊敵重逢、德孚運用本能、與邱氏分庭相抗、然而志與事違、所向不利、非幸運之欠佳、實技藝之不及、當其三盤失敗、趨前道賞之際、德孚早已甘拜下風、自願奉呈其霸主之冠冕矣、</p>
<p>（）三勝負焦點</p>
<p>在發揮原有特長</p>
<p>邱氏德孚固係一世之雄、原有長處、各個不同、而昨日决賽勝負之分、則在各個如何發揮其特長耳、邱氏善於底線抽擊、正反左右、逢隙直入、百不失一、鎭定冷静、自殺甚少、應付之佳、變化之速、超人一等、德孚擅長供球、峻急無比、工網攔斬手到功成、凡普通所謂不可挽救之球、渠恒能絕處逢生、是渠之獨具神技、爲網球界所稱許者、惟昨日劇戰之中、邱氏能實現其高超才能、而德孚失其原有特長、邱氏之左右急抽、固使德孚失其原有特長、邱氏之左右急抽、固使德孚無暇上網、偶而爲之、竟中邱氏高球之計、或被人踏空攻入、有時亦得奇效、但不如往日之穩妥、於是與邱氏專擅之長抽爭雄、不亦難乎、峻急供球、所獲極微、且多自殺、反不若邱氏發球多得分耳、一勝一負、卽此判定、</p>
<p>（四）三盤劇戰</p>
<p>直落三水到渠成</p>
<p>千五百餘人、高坐台上、目觀邱氏以高超技藝擊敗强敵、其引人入勝之處誠非筆墨所能形容、德孚雖失敗、而累次絕處逃生、大非易事、觀衆掌聲、每隨之而起、其三盤結果、邱飛海全勝、比數六比二、六比四、六比四、</p>
<p>高下懸殊　邱氏首先開球、轉眼卽勝第一局、德孚野球遇多之故也、第二局德孚有力之攔削、運用得當、占得勝利、第三·第四·第五·三局、邱氏以有計劃之方法、使對方疲於奔命、然後乘機撲殺之、德孚侷促不安進退失措、第六局德孚高壓占勢、攔網又利、奮歸此局、第七第八兩局、邱氏冷静又老練、處處　指揮地位、卒告成功、第一盤邱氏乃以六比二得勝、　　挽回狂瀾　第二盤開始、邱氏猛烈抽擊、遠近左右、隨意所欲、德孚出其驚人技能、莫不逢凶化吉、結果勝利歸德孚、第二局德孚發球不利、多自觸死、乃告失敗、邱之勝第三第四兩局、全賴其長抽之力、德孚屈服於其鐵腕之下、無發展餘地、德孚目覩邱氏又以四比二居先、猝然改變計劃、冒險把網作戰、一鼓氣下、連勝二局、頓成四四平數、第九局之勝負、關係第二盤之命運、邱氏似失其重心、出球之乏管束力、將以一比三失敗忽然精神一振、力爭上流、挽回狂瀾、卒以八比六勝得此局、形勢突轉、人心安定、末一局勝利之來、早在意料中矣、第二盤邱氏以六比四勝、</p>
<p>優勝劣敗　第三盤第一局邱氏角球累</p>
<p>施、德孚爲之左右、後以斬削之得力、反占上風、第二局德孚發球無力、全軍覆滅、造成一一和局、第三第四、各勝一局、邱氏以鎭静見長、德孚賴把網取勝、第五局邱氏顯露力乏、受人攻擊、而致失利、第六至第八三局中、邱氏居然玩弄德孚、攔網之佳、置位之妙、德孚對之、徒呼奈何、邱氏遂以五比三占極優形勢、第九局德孚、力爭得勝、而終於對抽之下、失敗第十局、結果邱氏再以六比四占勝、萬象歡呼聲中、邱氏榮膺冠軍上海高級網球單打冠軍邱飛海（右）亞軍德孚（左）（李尊庯攝）</p>

<p>單打决賽之初、先有女子變打决賽、經過長期之苦、始將難解難分局解决、凡格斯夫人與克倫諾夫夫人以六比八、七比五、七比五、勝柯拉沙小姐及勃登夫人、兩隊勢均力敵難分上下、以柯拉沙、最爲出色、反手攔網、獨一無二、球藝上此組稍勝一籌、理應獲勝、但最後柯拉沙足部抽筋、不能奔走、退守底線、偏促而敗、爲之可惜不已、以八比六先勝、而以七比五、七比五連失兩盤、戰爭之烈、可想見矣、</p>
<h3>夏令足球嶺南奪得錦標</h3>
<p>在延長時間中擊敗華東</p>
<p>華東以一比零敗得可惜</p>
<p>華東公司足球隊昨與嶺南在中華棒球塲决賽夏令足球（振遠杯一、雙方經九十分鐘之逐鹿、各無）建樹、乃延長時間、嶺南在前十分鐘中、攻人華東一球、結果嶺南遂以一比零勝、奪得錦標、保持振遠杯一年、</p>
<p>觀衆千餘難民苦哉　昨日之戰、劵資收入、悉數充足東北難民、但觀衆廖廖、僅千五百餘人、收人僅五百元左右、豈東北難民命該受苦歟、</p>
<p>形勢平均白費心血　下午三時、華東先攻開攻、嶺南聲勢極盛、屢壓華東、華東守衛嚴陣以待、不稍放鬆、惟李寗因手犯十二碼規、嶺南陳家球主踢球竟彈門柱而出、華東不負此球、可謂幸矣、後此華東聲忽盛、興兵入寇、黎寳駿兩次機會、均因脚頭不靈、失之交臂、上半時奔馳角逐、形勢平均、各無所得、</p>
<p>繼續交鋒兩無所獲　下半時易門</p>
<p>再戰、華東極爲興奮、大有餓虎撲食之勢、嶺南門前、形勢嚴重、江善敬馮運佑等、努力防禦、卒使華東無機可乘、一次江善敬與胡有成猛力搶球、江被罰十二碼球、華東由李寗主踢、輕輕一脚、球竟送出門外、機會錯失、豈嶺南之幸歟、抑李寗固意使然、予江善敬以體面歟、是以華東雖一再進攻、嶺南亦猛力入寇、終於兩袖清風、各無建樹、時間終了、仍無勝負、</p>
<p>華東易人命傷於此　延長時間、華東錢敬鏞馮念華二員虎將（馮昨日表演特佳）、均因脚痛不能續賽、乃易毛鴻貴楊人偉代戰、正在易人交鋒、華東陣線不免喚散、嶺南乘此進取、左翼帶球直入、抵華東門邊、送球門前、華東守門陸鍾恩跪地接救未得、球被嶺南中鋒彭廣新攻入、華東遂命傷於此、調換方面後、華東仍努力掙扎、冀圖挽回、終未如願、暮色蒼茫中、嶺南遂捧高大之「振遠杯」而歸、裁判員何春輝、　兩隊人才表演均佳　兩隊表演、</p>
<p>均有可觀、嶺南前鋒有陳洪光陳家球、驍勇善戰、後方有馮運佑江善敬兩名將之捍衛、馮念漢亦殊出色、華東方面、上半黎寳駿失機無算、殊爲可惜、否則結果或得其反、胡有成董少培、鳳屬出色人才、因被對方監視極嚴、未得盡量　展、新道健將馮念華及錢耀彬之表演、竟不下名將李寗等、殊可喜也、總之、昨日華東之表演、不在嶺南之下、而其失敗者、豈命運之不佳歟、兩隊陣線如下、</p>

<h3>足球賽友恒應戰南京</h3>
<p>友恒與南京兩足球隊、今日下午一時假中華足球塲作友誼賽、南京隊雖未詳爲何許人所組織、惟友恒隊爲加入恊進會聨賽已五六年、成績早著又加本年除有舊會員洪尊三王德康孔植梅子範沈炳總陳維邦俞斌祺等外、並有新徴會員三十餘人、屆時人材濟濟、必有一番劇戰也、</p>
<h3>樂華改名華樂</h3>
<p>由復旦大學隊替補</p>
<p>樂華足球隊今年人才分散各隊、不能重興旗鼓、復旦大學足球隊、擬借用樂華名義、參加西人足球會、但余衡之不准所請、旋由王復旦從中斡旋、並與西人足球會接洽、要求准復旦大學隊代替出場已得西人會應允、惟會中仍用樂華名義、對外界則謂爲「華樂」、並降人乙組中、此其經過情形也、</p>
<h3>市敎育局令知市校第四屆運動會日期</h3>

<p>樂樂足球隊、成立迄今五戰於茲過去成績、尚稱美滿歷年參加上海中華足球會聯賽、曾於廿年出征杭垣獲得杭州市麜祝元旦錦標、日昨該隊在新重慶路Ｔ字九號開第五屆成立大會當推隊長程知非隊副陳本立、幹理金頌康書記胡大年聘請何春輝先生擔任指導聞該隊爲謀練習起見歡迎各界函約友誼比賽以資他山之助云云、</p>
<h3>市一塲小足球賽</h3>
<p>昨日下午市一體育場有小足球友誼賽二場、（一）施脱勝同心、三比一、（二）志勇勝凱師、四比一、籃球新術（六）（不許轉載）白爾凱ＣlaireBurcky　原著張國勲錢一勤合譯</p>
<p>争球及跳球之於籃球戲中甚普通、惟後者、常因前者連帶而生、</p>
<p>爭球之情形發生如下若一攻隊球員於防守嚴密之情形、無顯着立刻傳遞進行比賽之勢時、３</p>
<p>或球爲二敵對球員以單手或雙手堅執形將互施粗暴之勢時則裁判員或檢察員乃鳴笛執行</p>
<h3>爭球</h3>
<p>跳球　將球於該二人之中央抛起、使二人躍起拍之、</p>
<p>若爭球之發生係於罰球區内、則跳球之執行、必需於罰球線上至於在塲中任何其地點發生者、可就地舉行跳球、</p>
<p>比賽中之職員、每有預先防範球員犯規而喧佈爭球者、彼等見球員行將衝撞其對手、或握着持球之對手竟預爲鳴笛日爭球是誠爲謬誤之裁判非惟助長粗暴之風、且於持球者以不公平之裁决也、</p>

<h3>九三老人馬相伯語錄</h3>
<p>— 景記</p>
<p>「唯有眞心萬古留！」</p>
<p>于右任先生發現明賢孫元化致王徴手書的墨蹟，送到相老人處，請求老人題跋。孫元化和相老人；王徴和于先生，都是蘇陜的同鄉：所以都格外有一種欽仰前哲的同感！本來相老人要親筆題跋，已經吩咐搜集了二三十種有關係的文字來供參考，忽然病了一塲：於是這個工作交給我：做了一本三十二頁的考釋！</p>
<p>這是引言。因爲在這手卷末，于先生抄了一首王了一（徴）和陶静節歸去來辭；這首詩，相老人，愛不釋手；於是請于先生再書一份，懸在樂善堂的會餐會客的室内。賴有這一幅了一先生的歸去來辭，相老人就集了好幾副楹聯對語。約略一記。</p>
<p>有一位沈博士求書，寫了一聯：</p>
<p>「以天爲歸向；」</p>
<p>何事乎傍求。」</p>
<p>「有一位劉委員求書，又寫一聯：</p>
<p>「循上達之正路；」</p>
<p>母曲侫乎比丘。」</p>
<p>有一次相老人指問：「電光石那能久」如何對法？過了一些日子，相老人自已説出對句：「朝乾夕惕兮常安」。</p>
<p>可是有一句，意義極好；然而極難對：就是！</p>
<p>「唯有眞心萬古留！」</p>
<p>「備考」明孫火車先生致王葵心先生手書考釋，上海徐家匯土山灣印書館出版：相老人題象，于先生題詞，王石孫公使封題面云。</p>
<h3>失地？里</h3>
<p>— 窒暗</p>
<p>！你知道麽！</p>
<p>一面飽聽着收復失地還我河山這些悲壯語，一面却在担憂害怕，萬一强盜發起善心來，日本的天皇陛下説：共存共榮的支那人，别乾嚷了，我把滿洲奉還了你們吧，但有一個條件，就是你能説得準確你倒底失了幾里地，才能如數奉還。不准翻地理之類的書籍。我想，這時的我們國人，一定急得抓耳搔腮，漲紅了面孔，急得團團亂轉，張三説千有餘里：李四説數十萬里；陳七説數百萬里：而王八却説數千萬里！　　强盜當然不會發善心的，可請放心。但失主要想收復失地，則最低限度總也該準準確確的知道到底失了幾多里地。老是發通電説收復失地數百萬里呀，發宣言還我河山數十萬里呀，百萬十萬還弄不明白，難道能收復失地嗎？這或者在想要把外國人笑死了，才去安安穩穩的收復吧？</p>
<p>我也知道里是有英里華里英方里等等之差别的，説幾百萬與幾十萬也許正是二而一一而二。但能草通電宣言這種人固然胸有成算不會弄錯的，而看通電的人却給弄糊塗了，他們或許捧了通電在問隔壁阿張哥，説説到底失了幾多里呢？我眞弄不明白之極了！</p>
<p>中國人能失地的，糊裏糊塗：中國人不能收復失地的，糊裏糊塗。糊裏糊塗，糊塗五千年。</p>

<h3>區老虎</h3>
<p>— 徐睡麟</p>
<p>區壽年之軼事</p>
<p>區氏粤之梅縣人，現任十九路軍師長，爲人勇敢善戰，滬戰一役，足使强鄰膽落，其功尤偉。友人成君鳳西，悉區氏生平軼事，舉以告我，爰記之。</p>
<p>梅縣多山，區氏童年即喜獵，常佩槍以漫游，後入軍藉，因精槍法，并富膽識，旋升至營長，素以捕匪得名。一日軍行山中，居民謂山中有虎·戒其勿深入，區曰虎亦人害，合亟捕之：遂偕小卒二人，裹糧入山，越日遇諸塗，虎驅偉岸，見人則怒哮，三人畸角擊之，二卒發彈未中，幾爲所噬，終爲區氏自尾後擊噎之。二卒殆不能行，憩樹下，區氏以爲大害已去，何妨更深入探，遂獨行。頃經，暗壑，忽又有，虎，自壑中躍出，區氏未及防，即被撲倒，左腿已着其利爪矣。虎張口欲嚙其首，區氏出手槍自虎口擊入一槍，虎跳跌以斃，區亦腿折不能行，俄二卒追至，舁之歸，尋居香港三月，始治愈，至今左腿之疤痕猶在，鄉人常呼爲區老虎云。</p>
<p>區有胞叔某，向爲梅縣之鄉軍司令，亦以治匪名，匪衆銜之，不幸爲醜類所乘，尸解爲若干叚，遍贈其親友，時區駐節鄰縣，奔歸，誓復仇，探得匪巢之所在，挾手槍二，予剌二，喬装往投，詭稱爲地之匪首某某，匪不察，引爲同類，居其巢者數月，遍識其人。一日全體匪徒，畢集於某村某舍，議往某地犯案，區密報駐軍，夤夜往捕，并約其鳴槍内應。午夜匪徒正聚議，微聞外間之聲息，區詭日，恐有警，請先往視之，匪衆尚嘉其勇。區出門，即鳴槍，伏兵四起、匪徒悉數就擒，無　漏網，咸正法焉。由此區老虎之名，遂傳遍潮屬矣。</p>
<h3>關於文廟公園</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>這才是公園</p>
<p>公園在上海，據説是早已有了好幾個，可是每年得納一元人頭税，這在公子哥兒們當然是「九牛一毛一，但」在一般勞工們，却是一個問題吧？</p>
<p>不化錢的公園，在蘇州河畔好像也有一個，可是荒寂得可憐，在那兒，除了一個茅亭以外，祇有幾枝挺立着的樹兒，其他的，滿地黄沙面已，要是没有人告訴你説：「這是大上海僅有的「公」園，」那麽，儘你怎樣的聰明，你是不會知道的，我想：</p>
<p>在不久的過去，文廟公園是開放了，不取資的開放了，當然的，游人的多是不必説。</p>
<p>有人説：「法國」「花」園是個半老底徐娘，兆豐「花」園是個　媚底小姑，外灘「花」園是個熱情底少婦。」我們底文廟「公」園呢，是個學者。</p>
<p>眞的，在文廟公園，不僅使你感到空氣的新鮮，他還會告訴你説，這是什麽花或什麽樹，屬於那一類那一科的，並且，在一二八紀念室裏，你可以見到六百磅的重量炸彈，你可以見到忠勇健兒用鐵血换來的種種戰利品，你可以見到那些畏死的獸類的護身符，在這裏，你會聽到衛國健兒悲壯底呼號，在你耳畔重復的喊呌：其他，他會告訴你祀孔的用具和一些普通的衛生常識。</p>
<p>在那兒，有一座富於東方美的宫殿式的圖書館，内部的整潔，將使你感到無上的愉快，我想：在這優美的環境裏，捧着書静静地讀着，眞是椿再好不過的一回事。</p>
<p>最後，我還得告訴你，在這裏是不要你納人頭税的！這才是名實相符的公園。</p>
<h3>説部扶輪會入關郵侶</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主</p>
<p>這裏目單説那一座小西邊門；它介乎小西門與日本站的中間，邊門以西，還有中國的商埠地，才與日本站毘連。邊門内以東，便是小西關區域，直通到小西門的城門口。它處在那適中的地方，名稱上雖也是一座門，可是外城和城關遺址，久已墊平了成爲馬路；就算這邊門還　然獨存着，也非原來的城門形式，倒反與北平的樓相似。不過北平牌樓是很美麗很偉大，照例是四根朱漆的大柱子，另還頂座；它只有兩根木柱和一幅鏤空的門額，工程是簡便和樸素多了。但那裏有値得留的，出了邊門便是北寗鐵路的瀋陽城老站，再過去些還有座公園。園内古木參天，風景是極其清幽的；樓臺亭榭那一類的建築物雖不多，卻有一座亭子。據説當年郭松齡在那裏曾陳屍供人觀覽，平常游客不大愛在那裏盤桓；但立在那亭子邊沿的石基上，向西南一望，遠遠地有一座很高的鐘樓，那便是瀋陽的郵政總局。</p>
<p>爲什麽要提到這郵政局呢？爲的是郵政局與這公園相距最近，出了郵政局的大門，東走不了二里地，便來到這公園了。當地的各色人等，似乎逛這個樹木陰森的公園，不大興趣，很難得上這公園來玩一趟。只像萬流歸壑一般，驅車經過郵政局的門前，到不遠的西北隅，逛那著名的北市塲游藝園，聽大戲評戲和十樣雜要去。只有在郵政局裏服務的郵務員和郵務生，他們大多數是新中國的薪青年，最講究個上清静地方吸新空氣，并藉着散步以鍛鍊體力，才嗜好與人懸殊，厭惡那塵囂俗臭的游藝塲，而成爲這公園中特有的游客。　　這是兩年前的事了；那年是中華民國十九年，在一個很熱的伏天襄，下午四點鐘一過，郵政局有一部分人員是下班了。夏日天長，烈日似火傘般還是當頭高張着，彷彿要把大地全烙焦了才肯罷休，這般人就是各回家去，也無非是度那蒸籠般苦悶的生活，不由都想到平日所常去散步的公園；只有那裏一些樹蔭下才比較陰凉些可以稍容休息，便不約而同的都向那公園跑。進了園門一望，滿眼都是他們這一類穿西服或中山装的同事，皮鞋與白礬布勒的足印，把一座公園縱横來往着全踏徧了。</p>

<h3>糧食米市愈趨愈疲</h3>
<p>滬南昨日各帮來源、約抵念餘號、然浦存尚厚人心一　不振、因重陽節將近、市勢步瀉、究竟洋米棧積　厚、零碎斛脚約不滿五百担、早晨開盤各貨頓勒二角左右、</p>
<p>新閘西路來貨約三十五六號、本街交易並不旺、溧陽·江陰·巴城等貨各短三角窰種薄稻埠尖亦跌二角餘、北帮頂貨市無上落、全市斛脚約二千八百石之譜、</p>
<h3>北帮試辦洋米</h3>
<p>昨日洋米、客帮略有問訊、因市價一再疲跌後、行情已達底盤、貨主亦不踴再爲貶價脱手數形勢已有暫轉定局之　　、但以復販不划、吃氣大帮過問、昨日本街胃口更呆、竟無只包交易、北帮則賤辦　　米四百四十四包、九元二角二分又敏黨三百包價九元二角七分、其他均無成交、卽此暹暹敏黨兩米亦已一個月以上未有成交云</p>
<h3>粉市步步下落</h3>
<p>大廠一致倾度抛……十萬包以上</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後　各月份均見不振、因洋麥報價　兩日連小三四角不等兼之現貨逢步定開、美國且有大量之剩麥貸出大部人心一致看疲、惟廠出不旺、市勢尚定、迨至下午開盤各月份又步落不已　、因各大廠家一致傾出、數量在十萬包以上、一般買戶已若驚弓之烏、抵抗無力、市氣遂見步落、照目下之情形而言外有洋麥之壓迫内有米價低鬆之擠軋、後步局面、仍難看好也、結果本月份較前日跌二分二厘半、上一月份跌二分半、十二月份跌二分、一月份跌二分二厘半二月份跌一分半、三月份初開一兩九錢一分二厘半、後市亦落一分云、</p>

<h3>黑鐵皮漲價二錢半</h3>
<p>黑鐵皮以底存之單薄、到貨之寥落致各帮需辦甚勤因此市貨遂有供不敷銷之概標準因之十分挺秀、每擔要估九兩比前又漲二錢半、但連日天津帮、需辦甚急、故期貨議判、亦頗衆多、聞同業抛出貨已有千餘箱之多其價每擔則在九兩五錢之譜云、</p>

<h3>載澧呈請查緝子媳</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨據北平電叛逆溥儀之父載澧，今再呈請市府，注意查緝其子媳溥唐石霞，俾追究其强擄去之三四百萬財産。</p>
<p>載澧這種財産，自何而來，我也不必去加以追究，溥唐石霞把這種財産，怎樣擄去，我也未明瞭其底細，不過前見報載，溥儀口中曾説過二房的二奶奶，不要臉子，搶了五六十萬的古董，到上海去逍遥，溥儀口中所謂二奶奶，是不是即溥唐石霞，何以溥儀祗説其弟奶奶而並不述及其弟，或者其中尚有問題歟。</p>
<p>「福無雙至禍不單行，」載澧長子叛逆溥儀，刦了關外三千萬人民，數千萬方里土地，雙手奉諸日人，而自已甘爲獄囚式的執政，其罪更著於溥唐石霞遠甚，溥唐石霞雖擄了三四百萬，但這種財産，還是私人的財産，與國家無關，載澧所生的二子，眞是「寳貝，」一個是國賊，一個是家賊。</p>
<p>或謂溥儀不過受日人之愚，做其傀儡，使溥儀而果有盜刦的力量，則復辟早已成功，何必做他人的奴隸，但是溥儀旣甘爲叛逆，身爲傀儡，則其罪已不容誅，載澧反不呈請市府通緝，而獨對於溥唐石霞，則一再呈請緝拿，眞是察秋毫之末而不見輿薪，竊鈎者誅而竊國者侯，載澧目光亦太短矣。</p>
<p>原來「上不正則下參差，」兄不兄則弟不弟，父不父則子不子，載澧一家之中，出了幾多「鷄鳴狗盜」的人的，非特男的如此，即女的亦何獨不然，溥唐石霞，與其夫同謀擄刦財産，溥儀之妾文繡，與溥儀大打其官司，欲脱離夫妾關係，載澧之不幸，亦眞是我國之不幸呢。</p>

<p>科學</p>
<h3>人類佔領海底了麽</h3>
<p>— 盡心</p>
<p>人類憑藉着科學，把自然界所設下的謎，所安置的種種制限，一一打破，六英里的高空，無量大的宇宙，廣闊的海洋，我們已有能力去上下，猜想和超越，所以一般人不免犯些誇大狂，以爲我們已征服天空和海底，成爲全宇宙的主宰，其實，人類的能力尚小得很哩！現在先就征服海底一方面説起，　　自從潛水艇發明以來，人們才算有到海底的工具，可是，潛水愈深，壓力愈大，太平洋有處深到六英里，大西洋的深度紀錄可到五哩，地中海可爲三哩，在那些地方，壓力大到每方吋一萬四千磅—七千磅，人類現有的智識，還不能使他到那兒去，我們克服海底能力的不夠，又可從幾宗海底工程充分表現！横越大西洋水綫工程，沉船打撈工程，潛行艇救助工作等等，所以有時整箱的金條，只好留諸海底，去年英國潛艇在烟臺附近沉没了，一船兵士，只得全數生葬，大西洋的水綫，装了七年，這些都是事實呀，在海底工作普通都用潛水衣，最早用橡皮做的，穿了這種衣服，能自由行動於沉船上，隨意工作，不過入水不能太深，一百二十呎以下，决非人們所能承受了，後來有人用一具密閉的鐵箱，給潛水者居住，再装上通氣管和廢氣管，有時附以數瓶的壓縮養氣，和一具清氣機去吸收那炭酸氣，在這　箱裏，氣壓與平常一樣，潛水者不直接受水的擠壓，這是牠的優點，最近美國加州長汀（Ｌong　Ｂeach）盛行的水底觀光，其所用的潛水器，也是這式，再備有四具面具，即使這四尺直徑大的鐵箱丢落在海底，他們在其中可繼續維持至三天之久，同時潛水者，可以棄去那箱底的鐵塊，亦的浮力也可以使牠上來，　　英國某公司製造的潛水箱，便用了一具濾氣器，潛水者在其内可以把空氣用了又用，以此種潛水箱，旣不受水壓力的制限，在四五百尺深海處所，自可自由上下，其上再安上了電燈電話，用吊車吊到海底，成了海底的眼，潛水者在其中，便可任意指揮别種吊車，工具的運用了，最近埃及號沉船内金幣之撈取，就是此式潛水器應用於海底工作之著例，</p>
<p>德國某中學敎師發明的鋼甲潛水衣，可謂兼二者之長，其甲胄係以鋁鋼一類輕合金製成，潛水者不受外面水的壓力，同時關節處安上了球軸承，旣可滾動，又能伸縮，對於水底作業，此可謂最新式的利器，</p>
<p>不過太深的海底，以其壓力奇大之故，潛水箱的製造遭遇有工程上的困難，在目前仍然爲不可能，</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3>改良送情討論會</h3>
<p>— 子才</p>
<p>無論個人或家庭，碰到了親戚朋友們有了喜事或喪事，必定要送個情！銀錢或代價品！表示慶弔的意思，這也是「禮尚往來，」人生所不能免的：所以個人或家庭的經濟預算表上面，都列着應酬費一項，看作一筆正當的支出費，　　可是近代的社會，習尚奢侈，送情不能例外，也一天大似一天：尤其在通都大邑，往往平常人家，對於幾塊錢的情，也是「司空見慣，」不以爲奇，一個月裏頭，送不得幾家的情，數目已很可觀，經濟不十分充裕的便起恐慌，有「送情大難」之歎，鄉村間似乎好些，送幾百錢，兩角錢的「老人情」雖則還有，可是大多數也漸漸的加大起來，或者加送些代價品！禮券禮物等，推原送情的意思，不過爲「表示情意，」隆重大可不必，而且大家懷着「投桃報李」的觀念，送的愈隆重，答的此愈隆重，而無之損失，宴會，脚錢等，也愈大，純臭隻方都受經濟上的損失，眞是何苦呢！　　我記得從前有位老師説過下面一段話：</p>
<p>「我對於一切應酬費，可以説是」　　没有的，起初有好多親戚朋友們的喜柬咧，訃告咧，……雪片似的飛來，我都看也不看，丢向字紙簏中去，情當然是不送：後來喜柬，訃告，……漸漸的减少，到現在可以説絕無僅有了，因爲我的親戚朋友們不是没有錢的，也不希罕我送幾塊錢去，我何必送他們呢？有一天早上，我聽得外邊傳來一陣很慘苦的哭泣聲，心中不忍，出去一看，原來是隔鄰一爿豆腐店的老閶，昨夜病死，他的老母和妻子因爲家境赤貧，没有錢來成殮，所以哭得非常慘，我矢道了，便拿二十塊錢送去，作爲成殮費用，無疑的！他們合家老少，是異常感激哩！」</p>
<p>這位老師的話和行事，未免有些「矯枉過正，」可是他痛恨一般的送情，認爲有改良之必要，却很値得我們的注意！尤其在這百業凋敝，經濟不景氣的時候，送情這件事，更有積極改良之必要！現在把想到的幾點意見，寫在下面：</p>
<p>一、量力致送，數目在一元以内！代價品同，</p>
<p>二、「老人情」不必加大，已經加大的不妨仍舊减小，</p>
<p>三、送者不望報，受者不必答，</p>
<p>四、親自致送！遠的設法寄遞，五、文字作品，代替銀錢，</p>
<p>上述意見，就一般的民衆着想而説的，！闊老富翁當然是列外！本會會員對於這個問題，如認爲有討論的價値，共同發表意見，討論研究，以資改良，這是我所竭誠盼望的！</p>

<p>的化装工夫，照着鏡子，認爲滿意後，娉娉婷婷的走到馬路上，聽見背後有人説「妖怪」，</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>忘了自已穿着的是十足的的装，用足了力氣向人發着救國要從提倡國貨人手，議論的時候，被人用眼釘着，纔發覺了把音調低下去，……</p>
<p>在墻邊小便畢，正在束褲子帶的時候，一回頭見來了個提警棍的印度大漢，</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>向着一羣人，拚命誇闊，不知道自已的債權人却並并吞聲的坐在旁邊，……</p>
<p>正表演着老師的醜態的時候，衆同學大笑聲中，老師不知覺的已進了敎室，</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>天晚了，爲了好要，向小同伴激勵説，「母親不敢打我的」，在繼續説着，「父親認得外國三道頭的，昨天帶了許」多外國玩具和糖菓」的時候，頭上覺着暴栗，耳中聽見母親駡着「少吹吹吧，」小鬼，」</p>
<p>家庭問題</p>
<p>也是法子一之</p>
<p>她一天吃過了晚飯，獨自到Ｓ路走了一趟，回來對她母親説：</p>
<p>「媽媽，今朝眞觸霉頭，碰着白相」人了，他們看我太不像上海人，以爲我是新近出門的，因爲在上海生活着，非有極新式的装扮不可：而且打扮的五光十色，别開一面，又爲被人瞧得起，像我穿的全身土衣，自然被人瞧不起，要來玩弄我呢」！</p>
<p>「韻琴，你的話倒是對的，上海人」的確是這樣的，不過你的爸爸進賬有限，我家裏也没有多大積蓄，對你不免虧損一點，衣的一項，終究失些面子哩一。　　她聽了她的母親話，似乎失望的樣子，埀了一會頭，然後抬起來説：</p>
<p>「媽媽，那末呌我這樣生活下去嗎」？你假使永不呌我出去，那是可以的」：她竟自回到裏面去了。</p>
<p>「韻琴，來……來……快來，有話都可」商量的，何必這樣心急。我看，你的要求也是正當的：不過這時你的爸爸不在，只好等他回來决定」，</p>
<p>「媽媽，究竟怎樣？否則，我要到」别處去了」。她愈加不好意思了。同時，威嚇她的母親。</p>
<p>「韻琴，阿捨的你，只你一塊玉。」我們晚年全賴着你：假使你背棄了我們，呌我們怎樣生活呢！我看，你的爸爸對你的要求，必定容納的」，「假使不答」應的話……」</p>
<p>「那末，由我……」</p>
<p>她看見母親這樣糊糊塗塗地混過去，覺得終没有良好的結果。她想，非更進一步威嚇，是不能把計劃成功。　　「媽媽，我定走了，祝你康健」！她説後，似臨行的樣子，</p>
<p>她的這副樣子，却把她的母親嚇壞了。連忙起來阻止她，並對她説：「韻」琴，這個問題，我來給你解决好了，你好好在家，就是最難的問題，也可以解决的」。</p>
<p>她的計劃，就告成功了。</p>

<h3>How to Eliminate Civil War, by Du Liang</h3>
<p>Since the revolution in our country, the national strength has declined due to frequent internal wars. The national treasury is increasingly depleted, business is withering, and the people's livelihood is withering. We are heartbroken, but we have no way to restrain the ambitions of the warlords. The national crisis has suddenly arrived, shocking the government and the public. From top to bottom, we are driven by righteous indignation to seek unity and coordination, and to invigorate our lax and decadent attitude. Considering the meaning of "born of sorrow", and reciting the poem of "fighting within the walls to resist foreign aggression", it seems that the future of the country can take advantage of this great difficulty to open up a new line of life. At the very least, there should be no more civil wars. It is like driving a light boat and encountering dangerous waves, with wind and rain, and the danger of capsizing is imminent. If the people in the same boat encourage and help each other and work together for safety, then even if the waves are bad, there is still hope of survival. If everyone is selfish and quarrels internally, there is little hope that everyone will not drown together. It has been a year since the Mukden Incident. The foreign insults are more urgent than before, and the prelude to the civil war has already begun. First, there was the conflict between Chen Wenhui and Chen Sui in Hainan Island, followed by the merger of Han Fuju and Liu Zhennian in Jiaodong. Now it is heard that Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui in Sichuan are brewing a conflict. The pillars are breaking and the eaves are collapsing, but they do not realize that the house is about to collapse. The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware that the oriole is waiting behind. Gentlemen, unless you have other intentions, how can you be so ignorant, deaf, and indifferent to reason and righteousness?</p>
<p>The central government's handling of the Shandong Incident has not yet been heard of any definite measures, and the plan to stop the Sichuan war is in the midst of anxiety among the important officials. Shi Qingyang is eagerly mediating, He Yingqin is earnestly inquiring, the Military Commission sent a telegram to investigate, and Ma Ze Zhao is earnestly making representations, all of which show that all parties have begun to pay serious attention to the future disaster. Although the Sichuan generals have expressed their desire to avoid it, there has been no guarantee that they will never provoke a war. If it is unavoidable, they will inevitably hesitate to make contact. Those with foresight should be restless and unable to restrain themselves. The path taken by those who call for peace is almost always to target the warlords concerned, and the gist of their arguments is almost always to encourage them with the national crisis and urge them to make concessions. Even if they kowtow to the warlords every day, it is not enough to turn their attention. The reason is that they take their personal interests as the premise and do not care about the safety of the country at all. It is like seeking the skin of a tiger, will the tiger listen? We can only plan to strip the tiger's skin. If the skin is gone, then the hair will have nothing to attach to. How to strip the tiger's skin? The warlords do not have a thousand hands and a hundred arms to support themselves. What they rely on as a weapon is their troops and weapons. From the division and brigade to the company, platoon, and squad, each has its leader to be dispatched. If these officers at all levels understand the location of their duty and no longer cooperate with the warlords who are cruel and harm the country, then the group will immediately tend to disintegrate, and the warlords will lose their support. What we should strive for is how to enable the soldiers to understand the great righteousness, and how to make the propriety of right and wrong be deeply rooted in the hearts of officers at all levels. Some say that obedience is the duty of soldiers. If that is the case, it is important to maintain discipline. Then we should say no. Obedience is the duty of soldiers, but obedience has conditions. Protecting the country and defending the people is also the duty of soldiers, and protecting the country and defending the people is unconditional. Today, if the superior issues an order to resist foreign aggression, then I will obey it. Why? Because resisting foreign aggression is protecting the country. Today, if the superior issues an order to suppress bandits, I will also obey it. Suppressing bandits is defending the people. If the superior endangers the country due to personal interests, or due to disagreements between each other, and asks me to rush forward, then I can resolutely express my non-cooperation. Why? Because I am the pillar of the country, not a personal pawn. In this way, the warlords will be dumbfounded and at a loss. The incident in Hainan Island, when the Zhongshan warship left Hong Kong because it was unwilling to participate in the civil war, is a testament to this. This kind of non-cooperation may be contrary to normal practice and difficult to implement on weekdays. However, at a time when the national crisis is at hand, and the warlords still want to destroy the national foundation with civil war, we can only take this radical measure. If it can be implemented properly, then without the central government's brilliant documents and without the running and shouting of patriots, the civil war will have been eliminated invisibly.</p>
<p>"Errata" In yesterday's current affairs commentary, the word "advocate" is missing in the sentence "only because of the eagerness of all parties to advocate the abolition of war". This is corrected.</p>
<p>Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Key Points of the League of Nations Investigation Team Report</h3>
<h3>Recommendations in the Final Chapter...</h3>
<p>Generally, sovereignty should be returned to China</p>
<p>Japan should have economic development rights</p>
<p>External personnel are working hard on translation</p>
<p>The Nineteenth Special Committee of the League of Nations held an open meeting</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a United Press report, the Lytton Report is 350 pages long and divided into ten chapters. The first describes the situation in inland China, the second describes the history of Manchuria and the causes of the September 18th Incident, and the third chapter and below describe the current situation in Manchuria after the September 18th Incident. The last chapter of the investigation team's recommendations is that sovereignty should generally be returned to China and Japan should have economic development rights, but it does not mention restoring the situation before the September 18th Incident. It advocates organizing new administrative organs and hiring foreign advisors with China's free will to assist in governance. Local taxes, including customs surtaxes, salt taxes, and postal revenues, should belong to the National Government, and the rest should belong to local governments. Regarding military affairs, it is recommended that China and Japan jointly ensure that Manchuria does not station troops to permanently eliminate the root of conflict. As for the responsibility for the Manchurian Incident, although there is no definite conclusion, it is said that it has been stated that the chaos in Manchuria under the old government is not a suitable reason for Japan to occupy the territory. (One-day special telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Various groups in Nanjing telegraphed the League of Nations, requesting that the report be discussed as soon as possible. (One-day special telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reliable information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, when the investigation team's report was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 7:00 pm on the 30th, it was the full text of the report and no summary was attached. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received the report, it immediately divided more than 20 important officials into two groups, Chinese and English, with nine people in the English group engaged in summarizing and sixteen people in the Chinese group responsible for translation. Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, Political Vice Minister Xu Mo, and Permanent Vice Minister Liu Chongjie all personally directed and supervised. After non-stop efforts throughout the night, the summarization work was completed. However, at 10:00 am on the first day, the British Embassy sent a summary drafted by the Lytton Investigation Team, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately started translating based on this summary. However, since the conclusion was the most important part, the full text was mostly translated by about 2:00 pm, totaling more than 10,000 words, and then proofread and revised. At 6:00 pm, more than 20 copyists began to use pen versions to clean up, and eight mimeograph machines were used for printing. It is expected to be bound by 10:00 am on the second day. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will use two airplanes to take off at 12:00 noon on the second day, sending them to the Shanghai Office and the Beiping Archives, and the Beiping Archives will forward them to Tianjin Mayor Zhou Longguang. It will be announced and published by various newspapers at 8:30 pm at the same time. It is said that the Hankou area will be transported by China National Aviation Corporation airplanes. (Central News Agency telegram on the first day)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It was decided that the League of Nations report would be published on the evening of the second day. Liu Chongjie telegraphed Beiping, requesting that the Beiping-Tianjin press jointly send an airplane to Beijing to transport the report to Beiping before it is published. Beiping replied to Liu by telegram, requesting that he find a way to borrow an airplane in Beijing. (One-day special telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Nineteenth Special Committee, organized a few days ago to handle the Sino-Japanese case in the three northeastern provinces, held an open meeting this morning to consider the request of Dr. Yan Huqing, the chief representative of China, to be granted a six-month extension in accordance with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, and to restrict its extension so that the League of Nations Assembly could submit a report on China's appeal. Dr. Benes, the representative of Czechoslovakia, severely criticized Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" and revealed that Japan was indeed planning to make it effective. In addition to requesting an extension of the limitation period, Dr. Yan also requested that the Special Committee find a way to prevent Japan from using the delay to increase the severity of the situation. Representative Hymans was the chairman of the Special Committee and presided over today's meeting. It was decided to handle the two points requested by Dr. Yan separately. Hymans said that the League of Nations Assembly had made several resolutions on the issue of postponement, stating the need to expedite the handling of the matter, and the Executive Yuan had also undertaken to handle the matter as soon as possible. Now that the Executive Yuan has decided to consider the Lytton Report in the week starting November 14, he feels that the appropriate procedure for the Special Committee is to wait for a while, and after the Executive Yuan submits its opinion on the report, he will immediately convene the Special Committee to consider the Executive Yuan's report and statement, and then draft a report to be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly. As for preventing the situation from becoming more serious, the governments of China and Japan have solemnly promised not to take any actions that could hinder the situation, but the Japanese government has already recognized "Manchukuo." Executive Yuan President Valera expressed regret over Japan's move, believing that it was enough to frustrate the efforts of the League of Nations. All members of the Nineteenth Special Committee agreed with President Valera's words. Czech Representative Benes said that the Special Committee had considered the issue of a more severe plan, but finally abandoned the severe plan and agreed to a more reasonable plan, but the course of events has proved that its trust has been misused. The Special Committee decided to notify the governments of China and Japan of the minutes of today's meeting before adjourning. (Reuters telegram on the first day)</p>

Su Bingwen, Zhang Dianjiu, and others sent a telegram saying that they could arrive in Beiping within one or two days. (One-day special telegram)</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army Recovers Taipingchuan Station</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The southeastern area of the Siping-Taonan Railway has completely entered the sphere of influence of the volunteer army. On the 27th, 500 volunteer soldiers, together with Mongolian cavalry, attacked the Kaitong-Taiping area, cutting across the Siping-Taonan Railway. At the same time, more than 3,000 troops from Shang Touguo, the commander-in-chief of the volunteer army in Rehe, and Feng Zhanhai's troops also attacked Taipingchuan on the Siping-Taonan Railway on the 25th and 26th. The Japanese army urgently dispatched the Taonan garrison team and a company of the 16th Regiment stationed in Taipingchuan to fight. As a result, they were surrounded in the area east of Taipingchuan and the entire army was annihilated. Our army recovered the station at dawn on the 28th, and traffic on the Siping-Taonan Railway was completely cut off. (One-day special telegram) (Beiping) After the volunteer army occupied the cities west of Harbin, they are now besieging Taonan. The area is guarded by six regiments of the "Manchukuo" army. The Japanese army in the area from Taonan to Siping Railway and Taonan to Angangxi Railway have all been reinforced to prevent the volunteer army from continuing to advance. (Reuters telegram on the first day)</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army Attacks Suizhong County</h3>
<p>(Beiping) More than 200 volunteer soldiers attacked Suizhong County on the 30th. When they reached a place eight miles away from the city, the Japanese army heard the alarm and rushed to respond. The two sides fought fiercely all day, and both sides suffered casualties. The county town was tightly closed and shops stopped operating. Because the Japanese army's cannons were very threatening, the volunteer army temporarily retreated. (One-day special telegram)</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army in Western Liaoning Attacks Two Railway Stations</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Deru and Sun Zhuguo, the captains of the third and fourth detachments of Sun Guoru's volunteer army, led 500 people to sneak across the Banlamen River Estuary on the night of the 27th and secretly attacked the Raoyang River and Baiqibao railway stations. They set fire near the railway stations, and gunshots rang out for a while. The Japanese army escaped on the armored train. Four enemies were killed at the railway stations, the telephone lines were cut off, and the Raoyang River and Baiqibao railway stations were captured.

<p>(Beiping) The Wang Delin's volunteer army in western Jilin is actively destroying the Jilin-Huining railway line in an attempt to cut off Japanese military traffic. They sent the Fifth Brigade from Hunchun to Zhongcheng, Xijiang, and attacked the Shangfeng area to disrupt the base of the Jilin-Huining railway. They fought fiercely with the Japanese army in the area for half a day, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. At the same time, Yao Jihang's troops advanced from Ersandao ditch in Yanji towards Longhe Village and Helong and other places, and fought fiercely with more than 1,000 Japanese troops from the Japanese Consulate General. Yao's troops had a strong momentum and attacked from all sides, taking a siege formation. They completely destroyed the railway tracks from Tongfo Temple to Tumen River on the Tiantu Railway. This railway is an important transportation route between China and Japan, which has a significant impact on the Japanese army. At the moment, the Japanese army is sending airplanes to cover the railway workers and is urgently seeking to repair it. The two sides are still in a stalemate. (Special telegram on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army Sneaks into Lushun</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to people from Dalian, patriots Xu Jingyun, Liu Changfa, and others organized a daredevil team of 30 people, each carrying a pistol and four hand grenades, and sneaked into Lushun, a Japanese military port, by sailboat from 囗囗. From the evening of September 26 to the morning of September 27, they began to work in Sanjianpu, Yangtouwan, and other places, destroying three Japanese machine fishing boats and sinking one. The Japanese authorities were shocked when they heard the news and immediately sent a large number of armed police to guard the coast and conduct a large-scale search. However, the daredevil team's whereabouts were elusive, and no one was arrested and no one was injured. Our volunteer army is working in the leased territory of Lushun and Dalian, which is a sign of encouragement. In the future, they will be more active. (One-day special telegram)</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army Attacks Huanggu Village</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to people from Xinmin, the National Salvation</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Army Jin Ziming's units and Jin Yutian and Zhang Zian's detachments under the command of Zhu Jiqing, advanced eastward from the third district of Xinmin on the 19th, planning to attack Huanggu Village. When they arrived at Dujiagangzi, they came into contact with a large team of Japanese troops and more than 300 pseudo-police officers and soldiers. After four hours of fierce fighting, the enemy stubbornly resisted with machine guns, mortars, and airplanes. The National Salvation Army was forced to retreat due to lack of ammunition. The enemy side suffered five deaths and more than 20 injuries. The National Salvation Army suffered 21 deaths and 30 injuries. Adjutant Wang Dongsheng was killed in action.

<h3>Zhu's Troops Deep into the Hinterland of Liaoning</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain organization received a telegram from the front on the 27th, saying that Zhu Jiqing is now 400 miles away from Jinxi, which proves that Zhu has penetrated into the hinterland of Liaoning. (China United News Agency telegram on the first day)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is said that 120,000 rounds of ammunition from Zhu Jiqing's troops were seized by the militia. According to the person in charge of the rear of the Northeast National Salvation Army, he has not heard of this. (China United News Agency telegram on the first day)</p>
<h3>The Entire Datong Railway Line Can Be Recovered Soon</h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) The Datong Railway Volunteer Army is winning victories one after another. Zhangwu has fallen again, and they are now fiercely attacking Heishan. The entire line can be recovered soon. (One-day special telegram)</p>
<h3>Reasons for Feng's Troops to Withdraw from Jilin City</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Reasons for Feng Zhanhai's troops to recover Jilin City and then automatically withdraw: (1) When the rebel army withdrew, they blew up all the ammunition and failed to replenish it. (2) The Japanese army used armored trains, cannons, and airplanes to cover the workers in repairing the roads and is eager to attack. (3) The elders of Jilin City, after surviving the robbery, could not bear to be ravaged again and pleaded with Feng not to hold on. At the moment, Feng's troops are concentrated in the Xiaojiu Station, Huapimiao, and Yingchengzi areas, actively preparing for a counterattack and determined to capture Changchun before the Double Ten Festival. It is a pity that ammunition, weapons, and winter clothing are still lacking. (One-day special telegram)</p>
<h3>Li Haiqing's Troops Attack Angangxi</h3>
<p>(Changchun) This morning, about 5,000 of Li Haiqing's troops attacked Angangxi. The Japanese army confronted Li Haiqing's troops outside the south gate of Angangxi. The volunteer army attacked urgently and hard. The Japanese army could not hold on and retreated into the city. The Japanese army headquarters received an emergency message from the vanguard and immediately sent the air force to assist in the battle.

(China United News Agency telegram on the first day)</p>
<h3>Many Japanese in Manzhouli Were Arrested</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Japanese who escaped into Russia and were transferred from Vladivostok, Japanese residents in Manzhouli were all captured by the Railway Protection Army and treated as prisoners of war and severely imprisoned separately. Although Consul Yamazaki begged Su Bingwen to release the Japanese residents to take refuge in Russia, Su Bingwen said that the Japanese had treated the Chinese too harshly, so he could not easily agree. It is heard that the original chief of the Japanese special agency (that is, the chief of military intelligence) and the members of the Sano garrison and Consul Yamazaki were also arrested. (China United News Agency telegram on the first day)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Today, refugees from Manzhouli arrived here. According to reports, the railway guards have occupied the Japanese Consulate, which was violently attacked by bombs, machine guns, and mortars. Although they resisted to the death, they were eventually broken through. The Japanese consul, staff, and the military police stationed in the consulate are missing and are feared to have been killed. The authorities of the Chinese Eastern Railway received the news that all the Japanese residents in Manzhouli have been wiped out. It is heard that no less than 68 people died. It is also heard that three Japanese were killed in Hailar and nine Japanese were killed and five injured in Puhatu (transliteration). After the Chinese soldiers occupied Manzhouli and other places, they searched door to door for Japanese. Many people were arrested. Several White Russians were also arrested. It is heard that the Russian consul in Manzhouli claimed that he could issue passports to Japanese who were willing to take refuge in Russia, but the Chinese soldiers did not allow the Japanese to leave the country. The Chinese soldiers have now occupied all the trains and have begun to transport troops to the east. The destination is unknown. (Reuters telegram on the first day)</p>
<h3>Gao Wenbin's Troops Attack Liaoyuan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The volunteer army Gao Wenbin's troops mobilized Zi Haichuan, Zhang Zibin, Tian Xingtao, and other troops to attack Liaoyuan, and contacted Dong Xiu's troops to attack from both sides. They attacked on the night of the 21st. Dong's troops advanced from the northeast, broke into the re-education factory, and released prisoners. The enemy swept with machine guns, and both sides suffered casualties. Regiment Commander Dan Yinting was killed in action. Gao led his troops to attack fiercely, burning the enemy's machine gun depot. The enemy retreated to the Xing'an South Branch Office and fired at us with machine guns and field guns. After besieging for a day, the enemy opened reinforcements from Taonan and bombarded the city with heavy artillery, causing extremely heavy losses to merchants and civilians. Our army retreated. Both sides suffered 40 to 50 deaths. We captured more than 100 rifles and two artillery and machine guns each. When our army entered the city, the merchants and civilians all sent ammunition. The security walls in the first, second, third, and fourth districts all revolted. (Telegrams on the first day)</p>
<h3>Self-Defense Army Active in Northern Heilongjiang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Self-Defense Army is extremely active in Zhangwu and other counties in northern Heilongjiang. The first division Zhang Yuhang, the second division Fang Shuchun, and other troops attacked Beizhen Beixi Jianzigou Bangzi on the 28th and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese army for two nights. Wang Liang, the captain of the Self-Defense Army, was injured and ten soldiers were injured. They have been sent to Tianjin Hospital for treatment.

The Self-Defense Army is advancing bravely and is copying around Halitao on the border of Zhangwu. The enemy is retreating, and Cavalry Commander Xi Honger is tracking and pursuing, killing 50 to 60 enemies and seizing dozens of weapons. The cavalry has retreated to wait for orders after running out of ammunition and is planning. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<h3>Han and Liu’s Armies Still in Standoff in Yong County</h3>
<p>The two armies inside and outside the city continue to face off with cannons, maintaining a tense situation.</p>
<p>Zhang Yue arrived in Beijing from Lushan to seek instructions from He Yingqin.</p>
<p>(Jinan) Shahe Telegram: Refugees fleeing from the city of Ye County report that Liu is forcing soldiers and civilians to dig tunnels towards the north of the city, in order to launch a surprise attack on the provincial army. The tunnels are already three li long. Liu previously used tunnel warfare to achieve victory when fighting Zhang Zongchang. Liu fears that artillery shells will ignite fires in the houses within the city, so he has demolished all thatched houses. He also fears that artillery shells will explode easily upon hitting hard surfaces, so he is paving the ground with carts and digging holes everywhere to avoid the shells. The city is now in great chaos. Soldiers are not forming ranks during the day and not returning to camp at night, engaging in rape and looting. The head of the Laiyang Chamber of Commerce, Gao Li’an, was forced to commit suicide by poison. Furthermore, Liu's army in Ye County is constantly using mortars to bombard the provincial army's positions. (A special dispatch, one day)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Shahe Telegram: For days, Liu's army in Ye County has been using opportunities to bombard the provincial army's positions with mortars. The provincial army has not retaliated. Recently, Liu has also set up artillery around the four sides of the city, bombarding the provincial army's defenses with simultaneous fire. The sound of the cannons is loud and can be heard for dozens of li. Although the provincial army has not retaliated, it has decided to issue a warning to Liu for disobeying central government orders. They have set up mountain guns, field guns, and light and heavy mortars all around the outside of the city, hoping that Liu will be intimidated. Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang of the headquarters stationed in Weixian arrived in Shahe at noon one day, and went to the front lines with Acting Commander-in-Chief Cao Fulin for inspection. He returned to Wei that same evening. (A special dispatch, one day) (Nanjing) This morning, Jiang Bo-cheng and Han Fu-qu received a telegram from Jiang in Lushan, stating that for the post-war management of Jiaodong, Zhang Yue has been ordered to go to Beijing to confer with He Yingqin and Zhu Peide about specific measures. After staying in Beijing for a few days, Li Yue and Fan Yuhuang, the inspectors sent by the military to observe the situation on both sides, will come to Jinan with Zhang. Jiang met with Han, and Han stated that he would completely obey the orders of the central government and the commander-in-chief. At 6:40 p.m., Jiang departed for Ping (Beiping), with various dignitaries seeing him off at the station. Jiang said that since the war in eastern Shandong has indeed stopped, he is taking the time to return to Ping for a visit. As for the post-war management of eastern Shandong, Committee Member Zhang Yue went to Guling to see Committee Chairman Jiang two days ago to seek instructions, and will then return to Beijing to consult with Minister He Yingqin on specific measures before returning to Shandong to report to Chairman Han for implementation. As for Liu Zhennian’s side, the central government will directly order Liu to comply at that time. Councilor Li Yue and Staff Officer Fan Yuhuang will probably come to Jinan with Committee Member Zhang Yue before going to eastern Shandong to inspect the two armies. He will return to Jinan in about four days. (A special dispatch, one day)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Zhennian's troops are all gathered in Laiyang and Ye County. Houses near the city have all been demolished, and gun holes have been dug in the walls, intending to fight to the death. Han and Liu's armies in Ye County are still in intermittent contact. Cao Fulin has dispatched Rong Guangxing's brigade to be on guard in the middle. (A special dispatch, one day)</p>

<p>Important Telegrams Received</p>
<p>(Yantai) Although war may be avoided here, the people are still very anxious, fearing unexpected events. Three thousand Han troops will arrive tomorrow and will be stationed in Yantai, Muping, and other places. The Chinese naval marines who landed to maintain order in Yantai are now withdrawing, leaving only 250 men stationed at the outer eastern fort. Liu Zhennian is still in Laizhou, and the Han troops have occupied the villages around Laizhou, determined to capture the city. Many houses outside Laizhou have been burned to the ground to facilitate defense and observation. The defending and attacking armies only allow 800 women to leave the city to avoid danger. Surprisingly, the two sides have not yet clashed. Many believe that Liu Zhennian is currently employing trickery. Liu has indeed obtained the support of the central government. Just before Han and Liu were about to break apart, Liu received a shipment of ammunition, with a passport issued by Nanjing. This time, Han acquired the cities of eastern Shandong that Liu's army had held for several years with a small number of troops. Liu's army is not weak, so why did they not resist? This point is very unsettling. Although Liu is surrounded in Laizhou, there are still several thousand troops in Laiyang.

<p>(Hankou) Qiu Jiadong, Liu Xiang's representative in Hankou, said that in recent years, Liu Wenhui and Tian Songyao have had deep disagreements. Recently, the issue of the Niushi train station in Chengdu almost triggered war. Furthermore, because Yang Sen had contact with Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou to deal with Provincial Liu, Provincial Liu suspected it was related to the Chongqing side, so he increased troops in Jiangjin, Liangchuan, Dazu, and Tongnan, and detained ships in Xufu and Luzhou as active preparation.

<h3>Yu Feipeng Talks About the Postal Situation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister Yu Feipeng of the Ministry of Communications stated that after the suspension of postal services in the Northeast, there is an annual loss of 4.4 million.

However, the ministry believes that this matter is of great importance and is carefully considering it. The foundation of China's postal service is indeed very solid. Once the situation stabilizes, starting from increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, it will not be very difficult to make up for these millions of losses.

<h3>Stimson Reaffirms Far East Policy</h3>
<p>Maintaining China's Open Door and Equal Opportunity</p>
<p>Non-Recognition of Any Territory Seized by Force</p>
<p>The Manchurian Incident Was a Major Blow to American Business</p>
<p>The Situation in the Far East Can Influence World Happiness</p>
<h3>American Fleet to Remain in the Pacific for Full Training</h3>
<p>Reuters, Philadelphia, 1st Day - Secretary of State Stimson delivered a speech at the Onion League Club here tonight, reiterating the United States' Far East policy, which aims to maintain the territorial and administrative integrity of China. Stimson said: "In recent years, our American trade with the East has expanded more rapidly than elsewhere. In the centuries to come, the other side of the Pacific will have a very important relationship. The nature of this relationship has the power to influence the happiness of the whole world, so it is essential to depict this relationship on a fair, peaceful and lasting basis." The U.S. government has advocated the Open Door policy in China for more than thirty years, based on two major principles: (1) equal opportunity for all countries in China; (2) maintaining the territorial and administrative integrity of China, as this is necessary for seeking equality. The Nine-Power Treaty is the crystallization of this policy. Stimson then mentioned the incident in the Three Eastern Provinces, saying that it not only dealt a blow to our American commercial interests, but also dealt a fatal blow to the authority of the great peace treaties that the world's countries had painstakingly built up after the European War to prevent another disaster. President Hoover's policy is extremely fair, and its success depends on the consistent pace of governments around the world, especially the world's public opinion on the non-recognition policy announced in the U.S. government's memorandum of January 7th (this refers to the so-called Hoover Doctrine, which is non-recognition of any territory seized by force). Stimson continued, saying that the United States should try to avoid political or economic differences and disputes with any country, and should not favor one over the other in tariffs. Stimson concluded by describing Hoover's achievements in promoting peace in Europe, such as suspending war debts, advocating disarmament, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, saying that this pact is the only link in the peace mechanism between the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 30th - The return date of the American Atlantic Fleet has been postponed again. According to today's order, the fleet will remain in the Pacific until the Battle Fleet's spring maneuvers in February next year before returning to its original defense. When U.S. Navy Commander Ballard announced the news, he said that the Atlantic Patrol Fleet was originally scheduled to set sail tomorrow to return to defense, but now, by remaining in the Pacific, it can obtain better fleet training. Naval officers all said that the original limited concentration period was too short to provide sufficient training, and that for the sake of saving expenses, all fuel and other supplies remaining in the Pacific could also be saved more. In addition, children of officers studying at school are in the middle of the semester, and it is not appropriate to interrupt them, so it was decided to postpone the return to defense.</p>
<h3>Lytton Report Quickly Translated by Japan</h3>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Burning the Midnight Oil</p>
<p>Japanese Military Expressing Strong Stance</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency, Tokyo, 1st Day - The Lytton Report, which is the focus of world attention, was formally handed over to Vice Minister Arida by First Secretary Green of the British Embassy at 7 p.m. yesterday, including one original copy, three copies, attachments, and maps. After receiving the report, translation work began immediately. The report was immediately transported to the office of the First Section Chief of the Asia Bureau, and the door was locked. Three police officers from the麴町署 guarded the corridor to prevent leaks. After finishing the collation at 7:50 p.m., it was transported to the translation office. Thirty-six young administrative officials and linguists were mobilized to engage in translation. The lights in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were on all night, and the translation was completely completed by 5 a.m. this morning. It was translated into 1,300 pages in Japanese. Today at 9 a.m., it was transcribed using a Japanese typewriter, and then bound into a book. It will be made public at 9 p.m. on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency, Tokyo, 1st Day - The translation of the Lytton Report was completed today. Foreign Minister Uchida went to the palace this afternoon to report in detail on the outline of the report.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency, Tokyo, 1st Day - The attitude of the military towards the Lytton Report was formally stated as follows at 5:40 p.m. today: A formal opinion will be issued after reviewing the Lytton Report. The original mission of the Lytton Investigation Team was to investigate the truth of the situation, but if the Japanese military has errors in the report of the investigation team on the military operations in Manchuria, China, it must be strictly pointed out. As for the opinions expressed by the investigation team on resolving the Manchurian problem, because its mission is only to investigate the truth of the situation as mentioned above, it does not need to be taken seriously. The Japanese military's position on the Manchurian problem has always adhered to its established policy.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency, Tokyo, 1st Day - The Japanese military is paying close attention to the content of the Lytton Report. The content will be fully reviewed today, and if the content goes beyond the mission of the investigation team, it will be rejected. Its views on the report are as follows: (1) The mission of the investigation team is to investigate all the causes of the Manchurian Incident, both remote and recent. If the results are described in the report, it is not its original task. The cause of the Manchurian Incident should be attributed to the political situation in mainland China rather than the situation in Manchuria itself, so it is necessary to emphasize the fact that the National Government cannot unify China and its anti-Japanese movement. (2) The Lytton Report is only to enable the League of Nations to fully understand China for the League of Nations' reference. If the conclusion is as rumored, it cannot be said that it is not an act of exceeding its authority from the perspective of the investigation team's original mission. Therefore, Japan's national policy on the Manchurian problem should not be affected in the slightest by the report.</p>
<h3>American Pseudo-Advisor Runs for Japanese</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 30th - An American advisor named George Bronson Rea, hired by "Manchukuo" to act as a spokesman in Geneva, landed in Cherbourg today. He is the only white man employed by "Manchukuo". Before 1929, Rea was the editor of the "Far Eastern Review" and was originally a well-known pro-China figure. Since 1929, his attitude suddenly changed and he became an enthusiastic defender of Japan.</p>
<h3>Bao, the Traitor, Sent to Japan, Not Allowed to Present Credentials</h3>
<p>China Alliance News Agency, Tokyo, 1st Day - Japan is bragging to the world about the pseudo-organization as an independent country, so the pseudo-organization sent Bao, the traitor, as an envoy to Japan. However, the Japanese government, after several secret meetings, has decided not to allow Bao, the traitor, to present his credentials. The Japanese Emperor decided to treat him as a person of interest. It is scheduled to allow Bao, the traitor, Guan Cheng to meet on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plan to Develop Industry in the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Setting Up Aluminum Factory, Organizing Chemical Company</p>
<p>South Manchuria Railway Cooperating with Domestic Companies to Control Coal Prices</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 30th - The South Manchuria Railway Company has formally approved a plan to develop new industries in the Three Eastern Provinces. Japan imports 12,000 tons of mineral aluminum annually. This necessary raw material is available in Fuzhou in the Kwantung Leased Territory and Yantai on the South Manchuria Railway, accounting for one-third of Japan's annual needs. After two years of discussion, the Japanese are now going to open a silver industry factory in Shenyang or Fushun, which will start construction within the year. It will cost about 10 million Japanese yen, which will be raised by the South Manchuria Railway Company through additional capital. The South Manchuria Railway has also decided to establish a company to manufacture ammonium sulfate, with a capital of 25 million yen. Preparations will begin early next year, and it is hoped that 170,000 tons of ammonia can be produced annually in two years, which will be sold exclusively in Japan. The factory site has been decided in Liushutun near Dalian. In addition, the Japan Coal Industry Association is now negotiating with the South Manchuria Railway to jointly establish a Japan-Manchuria Coal Sales Company in order to control coal prices. The Japan Coal Industry Association will formally invite the South Manchuria Railway to participate. If the railway agrees, the economic cooperation between the Japan Coal Industry Association and the South Manchuria Railway will begin. The capital of this company is said to be 5 million Japanese yen. After its establishment in the future, it will stipulate the standard price of coal and control the production of coal.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Faction Strongly Advocates Tax Increase and Expansion of Armaments</h3>
<p>Sharp Intensification of Opposition with the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Budget Not Yet Prepared</p>
<p>May Cause Political Turmoil</p>
<p>China Alliance News Agency, Tokyo, October 1st - Japan's budget for next year has not yet been prepared due to the three special Diet sessions. It is heard that the opposition between the military and the Ministry of Finance is becoming more and more acute due to the problem of financial resources. The two sides have different views. The military insists on increasing taxes and expanding armaments. The Ministry of Finance has expressed dissatisfaction with the issue of expanding armaments, but the Minister of Finance insists on opposing the tax increase. However, many young officials below the internal director of the Ministry of Finance agree with the military's proposal. The Japanese military's tax increase proposal has two major points: (1) If issuing public bonds is the only source of financial resources, 780 million yen have been issued in the first half of this year, and it will exceed 1 billion yen by the end of March next year. The interest will be 50 million yen. Issuing 100 million yen of public bonds will require 5 million yen of interest. The more public bonds, the higher the interest will be. The government's finances will inevitably declare bankruptcy in the future, and the propertied class will sit and eat huge profits, while the common people will bear the burden of interest. This is not a fundamental solution, and it is unfair. The military expenditure required in the future will be very large, and it can no longer be dealt with temporarily by appeasement. It must be addressed from the root. In the past, the rich class bore too little burden and gained too much profit, so the rich class should be taxed more heavily. On the one hand, it can maintain the current financial situation, and on the other hand, it can alleviate the dissatisfaction of the common people. The military's proposal to levy heavy taxes on capital, inheritances, and value appreciation taxes on urban land is extensive, but the Ministry of Finance has not yet fully agreed. (2) Tax-evading companies and fraudulent factories must be investigated thoroughly. Not only must the evaded taxes be recovered, but they must also be severely punished. This item alone can obtain at least 200 million yen. The purpose of the military's proposal is to conquer the zaibatsu. Finance Minister Takahashi is speaking from the standpoint of the zaibatsu. According to the current opposition between the two sides, the future of the Japanese cabinet may be significantly affected by this.</p>

<h3>After the British Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Conservative Party in Control of Power</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 30th - Before this change, the British Cabinet had 12 Conservatives, 4 National Laborites, 2 Liberals, and 2 National Liberals. After the reshuffle, there are 13 Conservatives, 3 National Laborites, and 3 National Liberals. In addition, because Baldwin also holds the position of Lord Privy Seal, all decisions of the cabinet will be unanimous, and its majority party in Parliament will be even more impressive, and all actions can be taken freely. The Prime Minister was originally elected in the name of "National Union". From now on, the so-called National Union is only a nominal name to the outside world. This cabinet change has no impact on trade policy. The measures adopted by the government are consolidated by the Ottawa Agreements, and can be implemented freely without hindrance in the future. In short, in fact, the British Cabinet will only take the opinions of the Conservative Party as the standard in the future. Those who are in control of power are the people who are in charge of the Ottawa policy, that is, the people who advocate protectionist policies. In other words, the Conservative Party is in charge of everything, and no other party participates. Reuters, London, 30th - The changes of the secondary personnel of the British government have now been completed. Those who have resigned will enter the Imperial Presence tomorrow morning, return their seals, and then the newly appointed ones will be sworn in.</p>

<p>Equality Issue Not Resolved</p>
<p>Will Not Participate in the Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Neurath Makes Statement to the Press</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 30th - German Foreign Minister Neurath made a statement to the press saying, "Since the results of the Geneva Conference" are negative, then other countries should now make proposals to Germany." Neurath said that what Germany hopes for has been clearly stated in the telegram of August 29th. Neurath then made a lengthy statement, the main point of which was that Germany demands to enjoy the same freedom of armaments as other countries within the scope of general disarmament, and that "no government can" abandon "Germany's right to exist. Regarding the following text of the negotiation issue, Neurath had the following"</p>
<p>Declaration: "Germany's right to enjoy equality in armaments," no one should oppose. In the future, Germany must no longer be treated with discrimination. Regarding this level, Germany will not participate in the Disarmament Conference for a day unless it receives a firm guarantee. We are waiting for all countries to accommodate our demands within a considerable range. We are also willing to discuss with those who want to negotiate this issue with us, even if it involves detailed points, but Germany's views have not changed so far." Neurath also mentioned the disclosure of Germany's secret armaments in British and American newspapers yesterday, saying that the "disclosure" incidents claimed by the newspapers cannot change Germany's attitude in the slightest, but only undermine the atmosphere of all parties.</p>

<h3>Tragic Situation of the Greek Earthquake</h3>
<p>Thessaloniki Continues to Vibrate Eleven Times</p>
<p>Residents Spend the Night Outdoors Like Birds of Prey</p>
<p>Corpses Are Piled Up in the Rubble, Foul Odor Is Shocking</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Thessaloniki, Greece, 30th - From ten o'clock last night to today, there have been eleven more earthquakes here. Several houses have collapsed, and the residents spent the night outdoors, so there were no injuries, but the people were terrified. The authorities tried their best to comfort them, but it was ineffective, so the affairs of the whole city were suspended. Merchants across Greece have begun fundraising to provide relief to the refugees.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Athens, 30th - The earthquake here has not completely stopped, and it shakes from time to time, causing the people who have been hit by the disaster to be frightened and have not been relieved at all. Many wealthy people in Thessaloniki have fled to safer areas. Athens has become an area where refugees gather. Yesterday, the refugees in the Larissa area did not dare to enter their homes overnight for fear of the recurrence of the earthquake. According to the latest compiled statistics, about 3,000 houses have collapsed. Currently, excavation work is in progress, so the number of deaths and injuries found every day is increasing. Not counting the recent twenty-four hours, it is known that 400 people have lost their lives. However, the unfortunate is considered fortunate, that is, the report yesterday that all 800 people on Oluchina Island in the Gulf of Thessaloniki were all sunk in the sea has been proven to be inaccurate today. This report was said by a sailor who passed by there, but after investigation, it was found that it was false. British warships have now also joined the relief effort, and their marines and sailors are now engaged in the dangerous demolition of houses.</p>
<p>Reuters, Athens, 1st Day - Many houses in the Greek earthquake area are skewed by the shock and are about to collapse. British warships have now fired cannons to knock them down, so as to eliminate the danger of the walls suddenly collapsing and crushing the rescuers. Ambulances work day and night, going deep into the disaster area. It is common to see unbearable tragic scenes. The nights are especially miserable. The sounds of groaning and crying of women and children are mixed with the barking of wild dogs fighting for dead bodies, which is heartbreaking. The stench of corpses is overwhelming. British sailors engaged in rescue work are wearing gas masks to find bodies that have been buried in the rubble for several days. The foul odor spreads far with the wind, and even ships anchored off the coast can feel it. Epidemics are extremely worrying. There have been many cases of dysentery. To prevent epidemics, the water drunk by the refugees in the disaster area is now transported by ships. Among the areas completely destroyed by the earthquake, there is a town called Stageira, which is the hometown of the famous ancient Greek writer Aristotle.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Starts to Seize Northeast Mineral Resources</h3>
<p>Basic Investigation Completed</p>
<p>Will Use Scientific Methods for Extraction</p>
<p>Riches Buried are Rare in the World</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reports that Lieutenant General Yoshida Toyohiko, a special advisor to the Kwantung Army, has completed the basic investigation for the development of Manchurian economy. It is said that the recently discovered reserves, such as the iron ore between Anshan and Benxihu, amount to 1 billion tons, the iron ore southwest of Taonan is 1 billion tons, and other places are estimated at 3 billion tons. In addition, in the interior of Heilongjiang Province, there are 11 gold-producing mines, and the output of placer gold along the Heilongjiang River is also abundant. There are 1 billion tons of coal in Xinqiu, Rehe. The reserves of other metals are too numerous to mention. They are truly rare resources on Earth. Currently, in order to control the economic planning of Japan and Manchuria, it is planned to use scientific methods for extraction.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhennian Determined to Defend Laiyang and Yexian Counties</h3>
<p>Troops Concentrated in Two Counties, Remaining Areas Abandoned One After Another</p>
<p>Fighting Outside Yexian City Still Fierce, East Gate Burned</p>
<p>A Jinan dispatch reports that Liu Zhennian's troops have recently been actively reducing their defense area and concentrating their forces. All counties such as Fushan, Penglai, Huangxian, and Zhaoyuan have been abandoned one after another. The teaching regiment of Liu's troops stationed in Yantai retreated to Qixia and has recently been transferred to Laiyang. It is reported that Liu will not defend Muping either, in order to avoid an overextended battle line and poor coordination. Observing that large numbers of troops have gathered in Laiyang and Yexian counties in recent days, and that defensive works are being actively prepared, it can be seen that he is using these two counties as the site of the final battle. However, the morale of Liu's troops is unstable. With frequent troop movements, many soldiers have deserted. The 87th Brigade of the Provincial Army, led by Rong Guangxing, is stationed in Pingdu and has intercepted more than 200 guns and weapons from Liu's defeated troops in recent days. More than 100 guns have also been intercepted near Yexian County. The deserters are disarmed and given travel expenses to leave. Most of Liu's troops are new recruits who have not experienced battle, so there are frequent incidents of shrinking back in the face of battle and desertion. When the Provincial Army first arrived in Yexian County, the 85th Brigade led by Li Hanzhang was in the North Gate. Liu's troops first sent out a regiment, which retreated after fighting for two hours. Later, two more regiments were sent out, which retreated after fighting for four or five hours. Their combat power is extremely weak. The Provincial side received troops to take over the defense. Xie Shuxian's unit of the Lunan Militia arrived in Zhaoyuan and confiscated a battalion of guns from Liu's troops. The Cavalry Brigade led by Li Xuande arrived in Huangxian. It was planned to arrive in Yantai today (the 29th), but no telegram has been received. Liu's troops in Yexian still</p>
<p>launch sporadic attacks out of the city. Laiyang is also actively preparing for war. Han Fuju originally planned to go to eastern Shandong again within the next few days to inspect, and the armored vehicle was already ready to depart. It was recently heard that if Han were to go to eastern Shandong again, rumors would inevitably arise, so it has been decided to postpone the trip and wait for the central government's handling of the aftermath. Fortunately, Liu's army is already surrounded, so there is no need to rush to resolve the situation. Today, the Provincial side received another telegram from Shahe, stating that yesterday Liu's troops in Yexian used mortars to fire at the Provincial Army outside the city to the east, west, north, from evening until noon. A major fire broke out in the East Gate, destroying many houses. Reconnaissance flights of gray-bottomed, yellow-winged aircraft from Weifang to Yexian were made on both days, and they immediately flew back without dropping bombs. (29th)</p>
<h3>Jiang Guangnai Detains Chen Guohui</h3>
<p>Chen's Brigade Also Disarmed in Xianyou</p>
<p>A Fuzhou dispatch reports that Chen Guohui, the brigade commander of the First Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, recently moved his troops from Quanzhou to Xianyou, and after arrangements were completed, he took a plane from Xianyou to the province on the afternoon of September 26 (piloted by Chen Wenlin, the director of the Xiamen Navy). He landed at Wangzhuang Airport at 2 p.m., and then went to the Provincial Government to meet with Chairman Sheng Tao. He stayed overnight at the Fada Hotel in Taijiang. At 10 a.m. on the 27th, he went to the Pacification Headquarters with Lin Zhiyuan, a member of the Provincial Committee, to meet with Director Jiang Guangnai. He was invited to the reception room through the transmission office, and then went to report to Director Jiang. Jiang asked Lin Zhiyuan to enter for talks first, and Chen was left alone in the reception room. However, as soon as Lin entered, the platoon leader of the Pacification Headquarters' guard, leading more than a dozen soldiers, each holding a pistol and submachine gun, broke into the reception room, claiming to be under the orders of Director Jiang to arrest Brigade Commander Chen. Chen's hands were immediately tied behind his back. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Chen requested to see Director Jiang, but the platoon leader refused his request and immediately used a vehicle from the Pacification Headquarters to escort him to the headquarters of the 19th Route Army's Supplementary Brigade in Dawangfu for detention. Afterwards, Jiang Guangnai came out to see Lin Zhiyuan and said that Chen Guohui had been carrying out perverse acts since he was stationed in Quanzhou and Yongchun, and there were mountains of complaints. The headquarters had repeatedly received strict orders from the Military Affairs Commission to investigate and deal with him, so he was temporarily detained and telegraphed to Nanjing for instructions. He asked Lin to convey this to Chairman Fang, lest there be any misunderstanding. At the same time, a team was dispatched to Wangzhuang Airport to detain the plane Chen was riding in, and personnel were sent to the wireless telegraph bureau to inspect it, forbidding the leaking of news. All newspapers were notified not to publish the news within three days. An order was also issued to the division commander Mao Weishou stationed in Quanzhou to advance troops from Hui'an and Nan'an to Xianyou to surround and disarm Chen's brigade. It is reported that Chen's unit has a total of three regiments, about 5,000 men. All of their weapons are made in Germany, purchased with the funds from the tobacco seedling donations collected in the Quanzhou area in the past two years, so they are quite elite.

<h3>Ou Shounian Returns to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Ou Talks About the 19th Route Army's Pacification Situation in Fujian</p>
<p>Weng Zhaoyuan Went Abroad to Receive Aircraft Donated by Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>A Guangzhou dispatch reports that Ou Shounian, the commander of the 78th Division of the 19th Route Army, arrived in Guangzhou last night from Xiamen by boat via Hong Kong, and then transferred to the Foshan night boat. Upon hearing the news, reporters went to Commander Ou's residence to visit and inquire about everything. Ou received them and made the following remarks: (Q) Commander Ou, what is your mission in returning to the province this time? (A) Brother has no special mission in returning to the province this time. I have been in Guangdong for four years, often in the military, and my father is unwell, so I have asked for leave to return to the province to visit him. (Q) Commander Ou, who are the people traveling with you on this trip to the province? (A) Only my wife Zhang Jinghe and attendants Wei Mou, etc. (Q) Since the 19th Route Army arrived in Fujian Province, can you tell us in detail about the plan to suppress the communists and the recent situation? (A) After the entire 19th Route Army arrives in Fujian, it will be deployed to suppress the communists. The plan is to assign the 60th Division led by Shen Guanghan and the 78th Division to be responsible for suppressing the communist bandits in western Fujian. The 61st Division led by Mao Weishou and the Supplementary Brigade led by Tan Qixiu will be stationed in the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou areas to earnestly carry out pacification. As for the recent situation, when brother left Longyan on the 22nd, the communist bandits had fled to various places in Changting. Our army in Longyan, in cooperation with the local militia, is actively carrying out pacification and rapidly building highways to facilitate transportation. (Q) It is reported that the communist bandits in Changting are being pressured and fear being surrounded, and will slant southward to harass eastern Guangdong. In Commander Ou's opinion, can this attempt by the communist bandits be realized? (A) In my humble opinion, although the communist bandits are being pressured in Changting, they would definitely not dare to slant out and invade the border of eastern Guangdong, because they are aware of the heavy losses they suffered in the Shuikou battle in Nanxiong earlier. Therefore, they would rather retreat to their old nests. Moreover, the purpose of the communist bandits' occupation of Changting and their recent attack on Zhangzhou was to seek an outlet to the sea in order to obtain assistance from the Third International. It is known that the communist bandits are not only suffering from economic panic internally, but their internal opinions are also very divided, and the organization is very complex. This can be seen from the frequent infighting and clashes between the various leaders internally. As for the shortage of food inside the communist bandits, the general situation can also be known. It is estimated that when we were stationed in Jiangxi Province to suppress bandits in previous years, we needed to slaughter 1,000 cattle per month. The number of communist bandits must be several times that of us, so they should slaughter about 10,000 cattle per month. After years of long-term occupation, how many cattle are there in each county in Jiangxi Province? Aren't they all slaughtered clean by the communist bandits? If cattle are like this, other food can also be known. Moreover, in each bandit area, the fields are all barren, the houses are burned down, and there is no sound of chickens or dogs. The miserable situation is truly no less than a human hell. The communist bandits are bound to run around and seize food in order to seek plunder. Therefore, the purpose of the recent northward escape was to attack Fuzhou and exit Nanchang. If successful, they would drive straight out to Anhui, Hubei, and Henan provinces, and connect with the communist bandits in various provinces. Otherwise, they would loot wealth and leave in prosperous cities and towns. Therefore, when the communist bandits captured Yihuang and Le'an, Nanchang was greatly shocked. Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Minister He executed the division commanders stationed in Yihuang and Le'an because they were negligent and lost their defense, as a warning to the future. Later, the communist bandits suffered a setback in their northward escape and retreated to their old nests. However, according to the recent surrender of the communist bandit division commander Guo Bing, "the internal organization of the communist bandits has no system, and all the Red Army units want to break away from the communist bandit life. When I (Guo said) first joined the communist party, I heard Peng Dehuai say how to seize power and how to operate. However, for several years, not only did we not make an inch of progress, but the difficult and difficult situation has not diminished, so the masses rebelled and left us," etc. This shows that the communist bandits are on the verge of collapse, and the suppression can be expected in the near future. Currently, the 19th Route Army is conducting the bandit suppression campaign with extreme vigor. As soon as the food reserves reach a considerable stage, they will continue to advance towards Changting. (Q) Where is the main force of the communist bandits? (A) The main force of the communist bandits is still gathered between Ruijin, Guangchang, and Xingguo. In the future, when the communist bandits in all provinces have been suppressed, it will be even more difficult for the Jiangxi communist bandits to gain a foothold, and the period of annihilation should not be far away. (Q) After the 19th Route Army arrived in Fujian, how did it proceed with the pacification? (A) It is quite difficult to mention the pacification of Fujian, because the latent power of the Fujian Provincial Defense Army is very large, and the pacification does not seem to be able to start for a day without the reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government. What the Fujian Provincial Defense Army relies on is the Provincial Committee, and each Provincial Committee believes that the backing force is the Provincial Defense Army, which is maintained with each other. The Provincial Government cannot directly mobilize the Provincial Defense Army, and must rely on the Provincial Committee behind the Defense Army to mobilize it. What a joke this is. However, as for whether the Provincial Government can be reorganized, it is quite painful to observe. As for the corruption of the Fujian administration, the multiplicity of miscellaneous taxes and levies, and what they do to harm the country and the people, there is almost nothing that they do not do. This is all seen in the newspapers and can be examined one by one. (Q) It is rumored that Jiang Guangnai, the Pacification Director, will also serve as the Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government. Can this become a reality? (A) Although this saying has been circulating for a long time, brother is not very clear. (Q) Where is Army Commander Cai Tingkai now? (A) He is now at the General Headquarters in Zhangzhou and will depart for Longyan to command the bandit suppression in one or two days. (Q) Where is Director Jiang recently? (A) He is in Fuzhou planning pacification matters. (Q) It is reported that Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan has resigned. What about this statement? (A) Brigade Commander Weng did not resign and go abroad. The reason is that when the 19th Route Army was resisting Japan in Shanghai, overseas Chinese donated many aircraft and repeatedly asked Generals Chiang and Cai to accept them for the purpose of organizing an aircraft squadron to resist Japan. However, Chiang and Cai believed that overseas Chinese donations were inconvenient to receive due to the environment, and they were subsequently transferred to Fujian. Later, the central government instructed overseas Chinese to have the aircraft directly received by the central government. The overseas Chinese also had to ask the 19th Route Army to sign before it would be approved. Chiang and Cai believed that this move was too flattering and contrary to the proper order, so they refused to sign. Until now, Liu Zhiyan has come to Fujian several times to discuss this matter and asked to send someone to receive the aircraft donated by overseas Chinese. Chiang and Cai also rely on the assistance of aircraft for the suppression of the communists at this time of tension in the bandit suppression, so they sent Brigade Commander Weng to South Asia with Liu Zhiyan to receive the aircraft donated by overseas Chinese. (Q) It is rumored that the 19th Route Army will organize a righteous army to go out to Shanhaiguan to suppress the rebels. Is this statement true? (A) This statement is quite difficult to achieve in the current situation, but if necessary, the General Headquarters will allocate four regiments of troops to be commanded by Brigade Commander Weng in preparation for resisting Japan.

<h3>Qingdao to Establish Fisheries Administration Bureau</h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry Has Sent Xu Songgang to Qingdao to Prepare</p>
<p>A Qingdao dispatch reports that Xu Songpu, a commissioner of the Ministry of Industry and director of the Hebei-Shandong Marine Fisheries Administration Bureau, arrived in Qingdao in two groups yesterday and today with eight subordinates, and is temporarily staying at the Xinmin Hotel. When Xu passed through Jinan, he visited Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, and Wang Fangting, the director of the Department of Industry, and the results of the contact were extremely satisfactory. Today (the 29th), he went to the municipal government to visit Mayor Shen Honglie to discuss progress and requested assistance and convenience from the municipal government. This afternoon, I visited Xu and learned that in order to promote fisheries improvement in view of the abundance of marine products in the coastal provinces of China, the Ministry of Industry has divided the coastal provinces into four regions: Fujian-Guangdong, Jiangsu-Zhejiang, Hebei-Shandong, and Northeast, and set up fisheries administration bureaus to engage in rectification. At present, the Fujian-Guangdong and Jiangsu-Zhejiang regions have been established and are gradually showing results. The Northeast is now under the forced labor range of the puppet organization, and it is still impossible to talk about it. I was ordered to prepare for the establishment of the Hebei-Shandong Fisheries Administration Bureau. The general bureau plans to be located in Qingdao, and eight offices will be set up in important locations in the coastal ports of Hebei and Shandong. It is planned to set up four in Hebei Province, namely Qinhuangdao, Beitang, Dagu, and Tianjin, and four in Shandong Province, namely Shidao, Weihai, Yantai, and Longkou. The internal organization of the general bureau is as follows: under the director, there are three sections: general affairs, security, and improvement. In addition, there are secretaries and technicians. In the future, fisheries police stations will be gradually set up to specialize in protecting fisheries. The nature of this bureau is to manage fisheries administration and is not a tax collection agency. In the future, the rectification policy should consider the urgency and proceed in order, roughly no more than the following points: (1) Rectify fishing boats and fishing ports; (2) Improve fishing methods and promote sales channels; (3) Raise funds to establish a fisheries bank to assist fisheries in developing marine resources; (4) Raise funds to run aquatic product training institutes to cultivate specialized fisheries talents; (5) Implement a protection and reward system for fisheries; (6) Find ways to recover offshore fishing rights. However, this matter is of great importance and is related to the national fishing rights. The government should be responsible for handling it, but it also depends on the efforts and cooperation of people in the fisheries industry and people from all walks of life in order to complete this major task.

<h3>Journey to the West (30)</h3>
<p>Oh, We Actually Met Them</p>
<p>The worried black night passed peacefully. When we got up on the morning of the 8th, everyone couldn't help but be overjoyed and restored the optimistic attitude of the past. However, the dangerous situation has not disappeared, because we stayed overnight in a bandit's lair, and today we have to open up thorns and walk on the bandit road.</p>
<p>Before we left Gutai, we first ordered the militia to occupy several mountain tops that we were about to pass. At 11:00, we arrived at Xiaoling. The mountain road was winding and the rocks were vertical and horizontal. The sandwiched nests were the most difficult to walk. The donkey drivers shouted "De er er er drive the donkey sound" front and back. "My Emperor, my God, my mother," intermittently. The difficulty of the road made the travelers give up the good opportunity to admire the scenery. The red haws in the green bushes were only for people to destroy and pick, without any pity or intention to appreciate them. In forty minutes, we all ran past Xiaoling, sweating like slurry and gasping like cows, and continued to climb Dalin (ie Shendao Ridge). When going uphill, the road seemed to be easier to walk, but the black clouds in front of us suddenly drooped. At 12:35, thunder rumbled and heavy rain followed. After five minutes, a thunderbolt suddenly rang out in the air, shaking the mountain valley. After that, small thunders started from time to time, just like the sound of cannons heard in Shanghai at midnight on January 28. Fortunately, we had arrived at the tip of the mountain and the place where we were resting, although some people fell, there was no major impact.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, we're out of danger," Ma Xiaozhong said to me while eating noodles, "When we were walking through Xiaoling," the outpost soldiers discovered dozens of bandits in front, holding guns, who were doing the kidnapping business to pedestrians, but when they saw us, they were polite and didn't move, and we passed by very calmly. Oh, "we actually met them face to face," Mr. Ma continued. The danger passed by silently. This is the cheapest thing on our long journey.</p>
<p>At 1:30, we went forward again and found that the downhill road was difficult to walk, not to let Jian Wang's nose. Except for one or two of us, we all walked down the mountain. At that time, although the weather was sunny, the wind and clouds were dim, and the mountain rain seemed to come again. At three o'clock, sure enough, the rain was like an electric shock and thunder drive. The horse sent a sound, and the mountain suspected that the ink was splashed everywhere, the clouds were low, and people walked on the mountain road without any shelter. The clothes and shoes were all soaked. The sky was miserable and the clouds were depressed. Everyone was complaining. When the river suddenly rose and waded through the ice, it didn't reach the knees. After such a hard journey of fifty or sixty miles, we arrived at the Xiangluo Village, the planned accommodation, when the sky was like pitch. When we arrived at the village, we were disturbed for a long time because there was no accommodation. Later, we found two houses and everyone put up beds and quilts, and our minds were calm. The next morning (9th), when we got up, we saw two mountains facing each other. Although the poplar forest was sparse, it looked good. The chaotic rocks in the river, scattered, although hindered the journey, also added a lot of spiritual scenery. That day, I was really out of danger, and after suffering, I came to sweetness. The road was flat and very comfortable. At 11:30, we arrived at Xuefeng Town. The welcomer sent by Hancheng led us to rest at the fourth district office of the town. After everyone sat down, Hu Juewen with a long beard pulled his braid and said, "Haha, yesterday" is very different from today." There is a Yuwang Temple behind the district. The statue of the god still exists and the barren monument is full of eyes. After a while, we set off, and the annoying mood of the black clouds came from behind again, wanting to threaten us with heavy rain again, but we had already put on raincoats, carrying umbrellas, things up</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Covered the tarpaulin, ready to resist at any time. At about 2:30, the rain's imperialists, dripping, attacked us again, but we were still happy and moved forward without worry, so soon he had no intention and tasteless self-retreat, so the setting sun appeared in the sky, throwing the red of the mountains and forests, to comfort the travelers who had been working hard for dozens of miles.</p>
<p>After the rain stopped and the sun came out, Zhang Mofu's white horse, my black horse, Ou Jianbang's light yellow horse, and a service soldier's yellow horse, like a whirlwind, set off towards Hancheng. The second batch of Jian Wei Gu Hansan and others also followed, and the rest of the people sitting in the sandwiched nests, although they could not gallop like horses, the porters also pulled the donkeys and walked quickly. Soon, at about 3:30, our four people and sixteen horseshoes rushed into Hancheng.</p>
<p>The scenery in the suburbs of Hancheng is very good. There is a Diaoyutai next to the mountain, but there are no fish to hang in the river. Half an hour later, when we were talking with Chen Jun, the county government and the director of public security, the second batch of horse teams also arrived, and the sandwiched nest team arrived at about 5:00. We rested in a school in Hancheng that night. After one night, on the morning of the 10th, we divided into two groups again, one went to Longshan to investigate water conservancy, and one went to Hancheng Qiaoerpo and other places to investigate coal fields, preparing to return to Han on the afternoon of the 11th, and leave Han for Buyang on the morning of the 12th. What will happen later, let's listen to the next breakdown. (September 10) From Hancheng</p>

<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Two Villagers from Wujiagang Township Kidnapped - In Wujiagang, more than ten miles away from Lumu, at around 11 p.m. on September 30, seven or eight bandits carrying two rifles broke into the home of a villager surnamed Zhou, kidnapped Mr. Zhou and his son, and stole more than 40 bolts of white cloth, more than 180 yuan in foreign currency, and 40,000 copper coins.</p>

During the handover, it was discovered that there was a deposit of more than 2,400 yuan in the district's accumulated grain fund, of which Ye embezzled and defaulted on as much as more than 1,200 yuan. This fund is now missing, and the receipt was immediately refused. The next day, Ye personally came to the scene to re-hand over, but the accumulated grain fund that was misappropriated could not be made up. As a result, the masses rose up to question him. Ye requested the public on the spot for a ten-day grace period, until October 4, when he would find a way to hand over the funds clearly.</p>

<h3>Robbery of Wealthy Households and Kidnapping of the Person in Charge</h3>
<p>In the Dawutou area, about half a mile away from Xuedian, at No. 572, Taiboshi, 12th District, a bandit ship suddenly came to the back river of the wealthy household Weng Yuqi's house last night (September 29) at around 12 o'clock. More than 20 armed bandits who spoke with a northern accent jumped out, landed ashore, and then went to the front of Weng's house from behind the house, opened the gate, and rushed in. At that time, all the Weng family members were already asleep. Hearing the sound, they were startled. Weng's wife, Ms. He, hid in the wood room. The bandits went straight into the bedroom of his son Zhendong, rummaged through boxes and cabinets, and wantonly searched. They were robbed of more than three taels of gold jewelry, and foreign clothes, etc., worth about more than a thousand yuan. After the bandits got the stolen goods, they kidnapped Zhendong onto the bandit ship and drove away. Afterwards, the police station was immediately notified to investigate and arrest them.</p>

<p>Bao Xiaokun of Chuanfang Township in Wuhe Fourth District used to be with bandits. He surrendered to the county government and was able to be safe in the township. On the night of the 29th of last month, Xiaokun lived in the house of his neighbor Bao Longxu. Suddenly, many bandits broke in through the window and shot Xiaokun to death, and robbed his clothes and other items. Afterwards, Xiaokun's father, Fuda, together with the township head Cha Yukang, went to the New Xiaoqiao District Office to report the case.

<h3>Confiscation of the Communist Party Leader in Wenzhou P]</h3>
<p>Hu Gongmian, the leader of the Communist Party in Wenzhou, who served as the Director of the Eastern Route General Command during the Northern Expedition of the former Revolutionary Army, colluded with bandits in Yongjia and other counties under Wenzhou after the purge of the party, causing harm to the local people. He claimed to be the commander of the Red Army's Thirteenth Army and the director of the political department. His followers numbered over a thousand, and their power was rampant. After the province dispatched a large army to suppress them, the bandits were scattered, and Hu barely escaped and went into hiding in Shanghai. He still occasionally traveled to Wenzhou, plotting to revive the movement. He was recently arrested by the Shanghai police. The authorities of this province have been notified by telegram and have dispatched officials with documents to Shanghai to escort him back for trial and severe punishment.</p>
<p>The Burning of Houses and Deaths in Fan Tai Kee, Pinghu</p>
<p>The inner house of Fan Tai Kee cloth shop in Chenghaitan outside the East Gate was guarded by an old woman, the owner of the shop. Last night (October 1st), around 10 PM, the old woman was checking things with a lamp and accidentally spilled kerosene, causing a fire. Due to the recent drought, the fire quickly blazed into the sky, making it impossible to approach. The members of the city's various fire brigades arrived quickly upon hearing the alarm and tried their best to extinguish the fire. After about half an hour, the fire gradually subsided. It is estimated that three inner houses of the shop were burned down. The old woman is missing. As of today, there is still no news. It is widely believed that she perished in the fire. Only the neighbors suffered some losses. Fortunately, the fire did not spread.</p>

<p>Survey of Autumn Silkworm Production in Xiaoshan East Township</p>
<p>The harvest of autumn silkworms in Xiaoshan East Township is considered abundant due to the suitable climate. However, the rural economy has been collapsing for years, leaving farmers with no ability to purchase silkworm eggs. In addition, continuous poor harvests and falling silkworm prices have made the situation worse. After Xiaoshan was designated as a sericulture zone by the province, more than 50,000 silkworm egg sheets were sold. Each sheet produced an average of about 15 catties of fresh cocoons. The total output of fresh cocoons is estimated to be about 700,000 dan. Most of the harvest is now complete, and the estimated output of dry cocoons is around 250,000 catties.</p>
<p>Locust Nymphs Swarm the Fields in Funing Batan</p>

<p>Chairman Lin Went to Fujian Yesterday</p>
<p>Departed Shanghai Quietly with Minimal Entourage</p>
<p>Rumored to be Mediating the Fujian Situation</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government, who came to Shanghai for medical treatment, has been receiving treatment from the renowned traditional Chinese medicine doctor Lu Zhong'an for several days. He originally intended to rest in Shanghai for a few more days before returning to Luoyang, but suddenly took the Wanshang steamboat of the Sanbei Shipping Company to Fuzhou yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. It is rumored that Chairman Lin received a telegram from southern Fujian the day before yesterday, urging him to go to Fujian. Therefore, he hastily set off yesterday. He kept it extremely secret beforehand, so no one went to see him off.</p>
<p>Departure from Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8 a.m., Wu Chaoshu visited Lin's residence. Around 11 a.m., Doctor Lu Zhong'an went to examine him again. At 11:30 a.m., Lin himself hired a taxi from the Lecoultre Car Company and quietly went to the Ningshao Wharf at the Sixteenth Pier with minimal luggage and entourage. He boarded the Wanshang steamboat of the Sanbei Company. It departed Shanghai at 3 p.m. yesterday and is expected to arrive at Mawei at 4 p.m. today (October 2nd). He will then transfer to a small steamboat to Fuzhou city. According to Lin's words to his family before his departure yesterday, he will stay for about a week and then return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Speculation on the Trip to Fujian</p>
<p>The outside world speculates that Chairman Lin's sudden trip to Fujian is related to the detention of Chen Guohui, the commander of the Second Brigade of the Fujian Provincial Defense Army. When Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai left, they met with Lin and asked for instructions on the military and political reforms in Fujian Province. After Chen was detained, Jiang and Cai reported to Lin. Lin decided to personally go to resolve the dispute because it concerned the stability of his hometown. However, according to people in Lin's residence yesterday, the Chairman took advantage of this rest in Shanghai to return home to take care of family affairs and there was no special mission.</p>
<p>Increased Customs Revenue Last Month</p>
<p>Smooth Progress After Sealing Off Northeast Customs</p>
<p>It is said that last month's Japanese portion of the Boxer Indemnity was paid as usual to Xinsheng News Agency. Since the implementation of the blockade of the Northeast Customs on the 25th of last month, there has been much speculation from the outside world that disputes would arise between China and Japan as a result. There were even rumors that the Japanese side was discussing armed protection of cargo transportation. After investigation, these are not true. At the end of this month, the customs authorities received reports from various customs offices stating that since the blockade, there have been no disputes. Japanese import and export goods between the Northeast and inland ports have been completed according to regulations. At the same time, the new checkpoint newly established by our country at Shanhaiguan has now been completed. According to official reports, customs revenue for September and October is better than the previous month, with an increase of approximately 3 million yuan. However, authorities stated that this was not caused by the blockade of Northeast customs. In addition, the Japanese portion of the Boxer Indemnity was paid in full last month and has not been stopped.</p>

Chairman Qin Runqing held the opening ceremony at 8 a.m. and then began operations.</p>
<p>Congratulations from All Walks of Life</p>

Ningbo Road was bustling with traffic at the time.</p>
<p>Congratulations from the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce congratulated the opening of the Shanghai Bankers' Association Joint Reserve, stating that the banking industry is the source of funding for all industries, originating in the mid-Qing Dynasty and spreading throughout major cities and remote areas. In the mutual trade between Europe and the West, Shanghai is a hub of activity. Those in charge are able to weigh the changes in the world and reconcile new systems. This has solidified the foundation and strengthened its credibility. Recently, in light of the difficult times, a reserve has been established. The reserve uses the public funds of an industry, gathering them in one place to enable collaboration and provide assistance in times of emergency. This embodies the idea of being prepared for danger in times of peace. It is said that it is easier to shake a mountain than to shake the Yue Family Army. From now on, a foundation that will never be destroyed will be built, and it will become a mainstay. We pray that this initiative will succeed.</p>
<p>Ode: Distributing surpluses to alleviate shortages, benefiting all, planning ahead for unforeseen circumstances, outstanding is the community, deeply rooted is its strength, connected as arms and fingers, prepared and without worry, for millions of years.</p>
<p>Respectfully offered by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Staff Members</p>
<p>The front door walls of the reserve are all yellow. Upon entering, the counter on the west side is for information and mail, the center is for silver, and the east side is for foreign exchange. The west side of the second courtyard is the manager's office, the center is the reception room, and the east is the public treasury. Everything is perfectly arranged.

<p>Indictment of Han Chinese Traitor Hu Lifu; Lawyer Hu Yan Maqi Defends</p>
<p>Han Chinese traitor Hu Lifu was escorted to Suzhou by officials dispatched by the Jiangsu High Court. After repeated investigations by Prosecutor Zhu (Wen Zhuo), the indictment has been completed. Yesterday (October 1st), the indictment was filed to the same-level Criminal Court. Hu has hired lawyer Ma Heng to represent him in court. The indictment is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Hu Lifu, a native of Yongjia, Zhejiang, opened a synthetic tanning water factory on Binlang Road in Shanghai. He employed a Japanese man named Washizaki as an engineer, and other Japanese employees were also hired. The factory closed down due to losses last winter. At that time, the Japanese army was disturbing Shanghai and the war was in full swing. In January of this year, Zhabei was occupied by the Japanese army. A Japanese interpreter named Yokota, a close friend of Washizaki, was familiar with Hu Lifu. Hu Lifu, being unemployed, asked Washizaki and others to introduce him. He was appointed by Captain Yamaban of the Japanese army to organize the Northern Shanghai Local Citizens' Maintenance Association, and Hu Lifu was elected as the chairman and Wang Du as the vice-chairman. The association was divided into six groups: 1) General Affairs Group, headed by Washizaki and Yokota; 2) Finance Group, headed by Vice-Chairman Wang Du concurrently; 3) Patrol Police Group, headed by Chang Yuqing; 4) Investigation Group, headed by Yao Zhiduan; 5) Transportation Group, headed by Cheng Hengri; 6) Hygiene Group, headed by Ding Guangyuan. The membership consisted of four to five hundred people, made up of Chinese traitors and Japanese ruffians. The association was located in the Fourth District Public Security Bureau on Mengli Road. The task of the association was to obey the orders of the Japanese army, maintain local order, and collect tax on Chinese goods to fund the association. At that time, any Chinese who transported goods out of the area had to report to the association for assessment and pay taxes. Hu Lifu would then sign and issue an exit permit, and the Japanese army would allow passage. The association was established on April 1st and collected over 3,000 yuan in taxes by April 10th. Later, the League of Nations sent a telegram to the Japanese consul for inquiry. The Japanese army claimed that the association was a free organization of Chinese citizens. They nominally ordered the association to disband and secretly instructed the association to reorganize into the Jiuhe Company, ostensibly to engage in commerce, but in reality to open opium dens, sell opium, and engage in gambling. Hu Lifu willingly participated in these activities from beginning to end. Later, after the ceasefire was negotiated, the Japanese army withdrew from Zhabei. Hu Lifu hid in Washizaki's house. He was repeatedly sought by the Shanghai Municipal Government but was not found. On August 16th, detectives lured him to the Xinyanlou restaurant on North Sichuan Road and arrested him. They found a pistol and many Japanese business cards on his person and handed him over to Beijing. After repeated interrogations, Hu Lifu did not deny the above facts, but claimed that all these matters were negotiated by Washizaki, Yokota, and the Japanese military authorities. He organized the association through Washizaki's introduction to benefit the Chinese and did not collude with the Japanese army to endanger the Republic of China. He also claimed that the collection of taxes was to facilitate the transport of goods by the Chinese, and all the taxes collected were used for the association's expenses. The pistol found on him was for self-defense. These are nothing but sophistries and cannot absolve him of his guilt.</p>
<p>Hu Lifu organized a group in an area occupied by the enemy and worked for the enemy army. This is a disregard for the law. The opening of opium dens, the sale of opium, the gathering of people for gambling, and the possession of a pistol are also criminal offenses. It is determined that his actions constitute violations of Article 6 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China (organizing an organization to endanger the state), Article 109, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law (working for the enemy army), Article 280 (gathering people for gambling), Article 6 of the Opium Suppression Law (selling opium), Article 10 (opening opium dens), and Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Military Firearms Control Regulations (possessing military weapons). In accordance with Article 253, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, we hereby file an indictment and request a public trial in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Xiong Kewu and Others Telegraph to Sichuan Generals to Cease the Conflict</p>
<p>Xiong Kewu and others sent a telegram to the generals in Sichuan:</p>
<p>To Director Liu in Chongqing, Chairman Liu in Chengdu, Commander Deng, Commander Tian in Tongchuan, and Commander Yang in Guang'an:</p>
<p>We have been reading reports for days that war clouds are gathering in Sichuan, and your disputes are to be resolved by force. We are appalled by this. You are all wise men and should not do this. The country is in deep crisis and it is time for all Chinese people to unite against foreign aggression. How can you bear to fight among yourselves and worsen the external calamity? The lurking of rebels is a great hidden danger. The people of the province have suffered from civil war for too long. They rely on you to rest and recuperate. If you do not disband your troops, the chaos will continue endlessly. We urge you to pull back from the brink, advocate for peace. It will not only benefit the province, but also restore the international image. In a single thought, the people of the country will admire you. Otherwise, criticism will come, and no one will be able to excuse you. This is our urgent plea, awaiting your wise instruction.</p>

<p>Appeal from the Fujianese in Shanghai</p>
<p>Swiftly Order the Garrison Troops to Consolidate Defense</p>
<p>Telegraph Request to Execute Chen Guohui</p>
<p>The Jianzhou Six Counties Fellow-Provincials Association reported that Pucheng County in Fujian Province was invaded by the Communist bandits in eastern Jiangxi and was lost on the Jia day. Upon hearing the news, the Jianzhou Six Counties Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai convened an emergency joint meeting of executive and supervisory members the day before yesterday to discuss matters: (1) Dispatch representatives to visit Commander Liu of the 56th Division in northern Fujian; (2) Telegraph to the authorities in Beijing and Fujian, urging the garrison troops to quickly consolidate the defense and suppress the bandits. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, Dean Song of the Executive Yuan, and Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs:</p>
<p>The sixteen counties in northern Fujian border eastern Jiangxi and have long been targeted by the Communist bandits Fang Zhimin, Shao Shiping, and Zou Qi. The three counties of Yan, Xia, and Shao have been almost entirely captured, shocking the provincial capital. Chong'an is still occupied by the Red bandits and has not been recovered. Pucheng was also lost on the Jia day of this month. This is a critical moment for the survival of northern Fujian and the safety of the entire province. Jian'ou is the first to bear the brunt. If Ouyang is lost, Yanping will be in imminent danger, and the provincial capital will not be safe alone. Jin Chongpu is the northern gate and key to Fujian Province, with a commanding position. Without Chongpu, there is no northern Fujian; without Zhabei, there is no provincial capital. This is the lay of the land and not an exaggeration. Even if the Red bandits have no plans to take the provincial capital, they are merely seeking to expand their nests, so that northern and western Fujian can form a unified force. The province of Fujian will then become a continuation of Jiangxi. Furthermore, this may also be a plan to attack Zhejiang. Zhejiang's defense is also crucial, but it is necessary to take a pincer movement. Otherwise, focusing solely on Zhejiang's defense while neglecting Fujian's defense will lead to the expansion of the Red flames, and eastern Zhejiang will inevitably suffer. The association saw that Chong'an fell into the hands of Qian Yuguang's troops. The garrison troops in Pucheng are still the weak and incompetent Qian Yuguang's troops (newly reorganized by Huang Bingwu). We believe the danger is very real. In August, we submitted a request to the Fujian Pacification Commissioner's Office, requesting that Qian's troops be transferred and Liu's troops be assigned to defend. However, this was not implemented, and Pucheng has suffered a great disaster. For now, we implore the central government to quickly order the 56th Division to concentrate its troops and consolidate the defense of Ouyang. In addition, we urge the 19th Route Army to dispatch elite troops to cooperate with Liu's troops and suppress the Red bandits in Chongpu. The fall of Pucheng is due to the fact that Chong'an has long been occupied by local Communists, allowing the visiting Communists to rely on it to plan a major offensive. Under these circumstances, even if Pucheng is recovered, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the bandits in Chong'an to prevent further trouble. The safety of Fujian Province depends on this one move. This is an urgent plea, hoping that you will investigate and implement it immediately.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Jianzhou Six Counties Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai</p>
<p>Also sent telegrams with similar meaning to Fujian Pacification Commissioner Jiang, Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government Fang, Committee Member Lin Jinan, Commander-in-Chief Cai of Xiamen, and Commander Liu of Yanping.</p>
<p>The Minnan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Minnan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai convened a board of directors meeting and discussed and resolved several important cases, the most important of which were:</p>
<p>(1) Resolved: urgently telegram the Executive Yuan, Military Affairs Commission, Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office, Commissioner Jiang, and Commander Cai to execute Chen Guohui on the spot and punish the rest of his gang to prevent future troubles.</p>
<p>(2) Resolved: telegram the National Government Executive Yuan to be cautious in selecting the Chairman and members of the provincial government, and to use those who can represent the public opinion of the province and can reliably be responsible for the improvement of the province as the standard.</p>
<p>(3) Resolved: telegram the Executive Yuan, Military Affairs Commission, Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office, Commissioner Jiang, and Commander Cai, requesting the abolishment of the Fujian Provincial Defense Army and other miscellaneous troops within the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(4) Resolved: the association should assist the Xing'an Public Association, and send a telegram to the central government and Commissioner Jiang, severely punishing He Xianzhu for disturbing the local area and eliminating the people's suffering.</p>
<p>Finally, the meeting discussed the progress of association affairs and the recruitment of new members. The above telegrams were entrusted to the general affairs office's document section to draft and send. The telegram to punish Chen Guohui was drafted and sent by the board of directors due to the urgency of the matter. The original text is extracted below:</p>
<p>To Commissioner Jiang and Commander Cai of the Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office:</p>
<p>Bandit Chen Guohui has been disturbing the local area for more than a decade, poisoning the masses to the extreme. Fortunately, Your Excellencies have ordered his arrest. We implore you to execute him on the spot and severely punish the rest of his gang to prevent future troubles.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Aviation Pioneer Li Ruyan Promotes Aviation Construction Movement</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Aviation Construction Association held a three-day aviation exhibition and lecture during the national crisis, it has aroused deep attention to aviation construction across the country. To popularize the propaganda, the Aviation Exhibition and Lecture Recording has been specially compiled and printed and will be published soon. Advisor Li Ruyan was invited to write the preface as follows:</p>
<p>Since the opening of the country and the great change in the atmosphere, all kinds of constructions have imitated the great powers, relying on their leftovers. In the past few decades, looking around at the differences in achievements, the distinction is like heaven and earth. Those who explain this say that this is only a matter of time. They invented it first, and we are learning it, so it is appropriate that we are not on par. Our country has been promoting the study of aviation for more than 20 years. Two years before the Republic of China, Ruyan studied in Europe and the United States. At that time, people in those countries were also in the process of inventing. The beginning of Japanese aviation was even after our country. How long has it been? The small island nation has actually roamed East Asia with its air force, relying on its prestige to slaughter our compatriots and invade our land. Is this the time? Or is the aviation industry cheap and widely used? It is easy to do and effective, unlike guns, cannons, warships, and other military equipment, which require huge costs and long-term training, and are only used for war. Therefore, the sudden advancement of its career is like this. The Japanese people have deep-seated plans and far-sighted considerations. The people are happy to cooperate with the government, quickly stand up and forge ahead, and carry forward and expand. That's why there are today's achievements. Our country's promotion was before theirs. It is not that the technology is not on par. However, after more than 20 years, it has ended up being lackluster and lagging behind. The reason for this can be deeply pondered. In recent years, people in the country have been vigilant about the dangers of the country and have changed their attitude of onlookers in the past, seeking ways to save themselves. They have gradually paid attention to the aviation industry. It is only that the government authorities, although they talk about construction, are only worried about economic decline. Ruyan has been in this business for many years, and always thinks about how to combine the efforts of the group and make appropriate publicity and organization, but this easy-to-see success has never been achieved. Now, I am happy to see the organization of the Aviation Association, gathering talents and leading the people, starting with promotion to win over feelings, gathering lectures and publishing them as a special collection. It can be seen that the news will rise and feel moved a lot, and it will add a special color to transportation and military affairs. Although it is not as good as following the gentlemen, I hope to get a proper reward. Today, I see it being put into practice. I can't help but be happy, cheered, and fragrant to celebrate. This is the preface.</p>

<p>Report from the Presidium</p>
<p>Chairman Wu Xingya reported that they were elected as executive and supervisory committee members of this city, and felt that their talents and strength were weak and could not bear the heavy responsibility. However, as the responsibility of party members lies, in the current exceptionally difficult revolutionary environment, when the country is facing internal and external troubles, it is the autumn for our party members to sacrifice and struggle. Therefore, no matter how difficult or arduous, they must take responsibility, give their bodies and minds to the party, stand up and move forward.</p>
<p>Instructions from the Oath-Taking Official</p>
<p>Central oath-taking official Wu Tiecheng delivered instructions, stating that since the reorganization of the party in the 13th year, it has invigorated its spirit, carried out the Northern Expedition and unification, and the great work is about to be completed. However, banditry has continued, and natural disasters have followed, creating an unprecedented situation. However, the revolutionary cause is originally a curved process, and we only pray that all party members will continue to work hard, and the revolution will surely have a day of complete success. The municipal party headquarters has eliminated all evil forces through its past efforts, but this work is still in the passive aspect. In the future, we should work harder on the construction undertakings in the active aspect. Given the importance of Shanghai's position, those who bear the local responsibility of this city should make extra efforts. When the local area of this city is safe, it will consolidate the position of the central government. In addition, municipal oath-taking official Yu Hongjun spoke to the executive and supervisory committee members of various districts, stating that district party headquarters and district branches are the foundation of the party. Whenever a party has good principles, it should have good party members and good organization. Today, the members of the executive committee of each district should not only faithfully carry out today's declaration, but also eliminate all unconscious disputes. Local autonomy in this city is now actively progressing, and we urgently hope that all committee members can sincerely assist to achieve completion as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Among the guests, Wang Qi, member of the Central Committee; Wang Xiaolai, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Huang Boqiao, director of the Public Works Bureau; and Zhou Xuexiang, representative of the labor community, delivered speeches in succession, many of which were encouraging. Finally, Wu Xingya, representative of the municipal executive and supervisory committee members, and Ye Guancian, representative of the executive and supervisory committee members of various districts, gave reply speeches. After that, photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

It is heard that the initiators of the association, Guo Shun and others, to respect the government, have already drafted organizational reasons in accordance with the law, and are preparing to apply to the party and government agencies for the issuance of a license, so as to start preparations, while actively seeking initiators to thicken its strength.</p>
<p>Handover of the Arsenal Yesterday</p>
<p>Li Shiqiong Appointed Director of the Office</p>
<p>The Shanghai Arsenal was ordered to be closed the day before yesterday.

Factory Director Song and Audit Section Chief Lin Tong handed over the factory seal to Committee Member Li Shiqiong for safekeeping. Other documents can be completely handed over within ten days.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Office</p>

<p>Dockworkers' Representatives Return to Shanghai from Beijing Petition</p>
<p>Urging the Public Security Bureau to Release Detained Fellow Workers</p>
<p>After the "September 23rd Incident" occurred, the dockworkers in the city automatically established a temporary office of dockworker representatives. In addition to submitting it to the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee for filing, they also organized a delegation of dockworker representatives to petition in Beijing, putting forward five demands. The delegation returned to Shanghai yesterday. The office had received prior notice and gathered workers to greet them at the North Railway Station. After the delegation members got off the train, they interacted with the welcoming workers. At 2:00 p.m., a welcome meeting was held in Pudong, presided over by Yu Desheng, who reported the significance of the welcome. Delegation representatives Feng Bingsheng and Bian Jinbiao successively reported on the petition process and read out the official documents of the Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan. Then, they discussed the future work plan and dispersed after shouting slogans. The delegation then went to the Public Security Bureau to hold incense and petition Director Wen, demanding the execution of the central government's decision and the immediate release of the seven detained fellow workers, including Zhou Hanqing. Because the director was not present, Director Lin received them. The delegation sent Wu Ziying, Xu Guijia, Wang Guantao, and Guo Liangjun to present the central government's order and request their release. Director Lin replied that the case had been submitted to the municipal government for instructions, and no orders had been received, so it was inconvenient to accept. The delegation returned without success and reported to the office. The office will convene a committee meeting today to discuss the next rescue steps.</p>

<p>Sports</p>
<p>Today's Soccer Games</p>
<p>Jinan vs. Lancashire at Yi Garden</p>
<p>Donghua vs. French Businessmen at the Baseball Field</p>
<p>The Westerners' Football Association opened in mid-October. Recently, each team has been training hard and sparing no effort. Today, there are two groups of matches involving Chinese teams, competing at Yi Garden and the Baseball Field respectively.</p>
<p>Jinan vs. Lancashire</p>
<p>Shanghai football fans have seen many Donghua games. Jinan has not yet shown its skills this fall. The team has arranged a friendly match with the British Army Lancashire at Yi Garden at 3:00 PM today. Jinan's strength remains the same, and the addition of Malaysian star Xu Yahui as center back makes the team even stronger. According to Jinan director Dong Liangguocai, due to a lack of practice, it may be difficult to perform well. However, the fierceness of the generals will not be diminished. Today's match against Lancashire, represented by Lincoln from the Western League, is sure to be a fierce competition. Jinan's lineup is as follows:</p>

<h3>Wanshou Township Robbery and Murder</h3>
<p>In Wu Yi's Fourth District, Wanshou Township, Xiaoshi Village, the home of Gao Honggen was suddenly attacked by a group of armed bandits late on the night of the 29th. They used stones to break down the door and enter. Finding the room door locked, the bandits fired shots through the window into the room, hitting Honggen's second son, Shunsheng, in the abdomen. As the village's alarm gongs sounded, the bandits, realizing the situation was bad, fled with shouts. The victim's family intended to take the injured man to the hospital for treatment, but he died before dawn. The incident was reported to the County Court Procuratorate, which sent officials to conduct an examination at 3:00 PM on the 30th, and ordered the arrest of the bandits to be brought to justice.</p>

<h3>Entire Shanghai Public Wildly Celebrates Qiu Feihai's Straight-Set Victory Over Defu</h3>
<p>Wins this year's Senior Men's Singles Tennis Championship</p>
<p>Women's Doubles Championship also Decided</p>
<p>The Shanghai Senior Men's Singles Tennis Final, which caused a sensation throughout Shanghai, saw Chinese tennis star Qiu Feihai defeat defending champion Defu in straight sets with scores of 6-2, 6-4, and 6-4, winning this year's championship. Qiu's success is worthy of celebration, and international glory has shone on the world. Before the final, the Women's Doubles Final saw Mrs. Klenoff and Mrs. Fangers defeat Mrs. Borden and Miss Corasha with a score of 2-1 (8-6, 5-7, 5-7).</p>
<p>(1) Long-Held Wish Fulfilled</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai's Late-Career Glory</p>
<p>Since Qiu Feihai appeared on the tennis stage after returning to China, he initially won the tennis championship at the Far Eastern Games with Lin Baohua, which had never been achieved before. Qiu contributed significantly to the gradual rise of the Chinese tennis world. Although Qiu had no outstanding record in recent years, he was still able to maintain his original skills and compete with the world. However, realizing that his golden age was about to pass, he made a stunning move before his farewell retirement, ending his glorious life history. At the beginning of this year's Shanghai Senior Singles, Qiu came to Shanghai at the right time, took up his racket, and enlisted in the army, repeatedly making contributions. First, he defeated Smith in straight sets, then he defeated Jiang Daozhang in straight sets. In the semi-final last week, he defeated Lin Baohua 3-1, and yesterday in the final, he defeated Defu in straight sets again. In the assembly of heroes, he jumped again and again and finally took the first seat. The previous shame was washed away, and a long-held wish was fulfilled. Qiu is truly an outstanding figure in the tennis world. Those who admire Qiu generally hope that Qiu will use his achievements to promote younger generations and cultivate new talents, which would undoubtedly be of great benefit to the country.</p>
<p>(2) Acknowledges Defeat</p>
<p>Defu Willingly Offers the Crown</p>
<p>Defu, a Canadian Davis Cup player, relied on his natural height and long arms, as well as his specialized serve-and-volley tactics, to dominate Shanghai and become a champion. Last year, he met Qiu in the Senior Singles and won the championship. In this year's final, the old rivals met again. Defu used his instincts to compete with Qiu, but his ambitions and reality diverged, and everything went against him. It was not a lack of luck, but a lack of skill. When he failed in three sets and stepped forward to congratulate, Defu had already acknowledged defeat and willingly presented his champion's crown.</p>
<p>(3) Three Points of Victory and Defeat</p>
<p>In Exploiting Original Strengths</p>
<p>Qiu and Defu are both heroes of their time, and their original strengths are different. However, the difference between victory and defeat in yesterday's final lies in how well each of them could exploit their strengths. Qiu is good at baseline shots, forehand and backhand, left and right, entering directly into the gaps, with few misses. He is calm and collected, with few unforced errors. His response is excellent, and his changes are faster than others. Defu is good at serving, with unmatched speed and spin, and his volleying is accurate and effective. He can often survive impossible situations, which is his unique skill and is praised by the tennis world. However, in yesterday's intense battle, Qiu was able to realize his superb talents, while Defu lost his original strengths. Qiu's sharp left and right shots prevented Defu from volleying. Occasionally, he would fall into Qiu's high ball trap or be attacked by someone stepping forward, which was sometimes surprisingly effective, but not as reliable as in the past. Therefore, it was difficult to compete with Qiu's specialized long shots. His fast and sharp serves yielded very little and often resulted in unforced errors, which were not as effective as Qiu's serves. The victory and defeat were determined by this.</p>
<p>(4) Three Sets of Intense Battle</p>
<p>Straight Sets Come Naturally</p>
<p>Over 1,500 people sat high in the stands, watching Qiu defeat a strong enemy with superb skills. The captivating aspect was truly beyond description. Although Defu failed, he repeatedly escaped from desperate situations, which was no easy feat. The audience's applause rose with each escape. The result of the three sets was a complete victory for Qiu Feihai, with scores of 6-2, 6-4, and 6-4.</p>
<p>The difference in skill was significant. Qiu served first and won the first game in the blink of an eye because Defu made too many errors. In the second game, Defu's powerful blocks were used properly, giving him the victory. In the third, fourth, and fifth games, Qiu used a planned approach to exhaust his opponent and then seize the opportunity to kill. Defu was uneasy and at a loss. In the sixth game, Defu used high pressure to gain momentum, and his volleying was also effective, allowing him to win this game. In the seventh and eighth games, Qiu was calm and experienced, commanding the position everywhere and finally succeeding. Qiu won the first set with a score of 6-2.</p>
<p>Turning the Tide. At the beginning of the second set, Qiu shot violently, near and far, left and right, as he pleased. Defu used his amazing skills to turn misfortune into good fortune. As a result, victory went to Defu. In the second game, Defu's serve was unfavorable, with many self-inflicted errors, and he lost. Qiu's victory in the third and fourth games relied entirely on his long shots. Defu succumbed to his iron fist and had no room to develop. Seeing Qiu taking the lead again with a score of 4-2, Defu suddenly changed his plan, taking a risk and volleying, winning two games in a row in one fell swoop, tying the score at 4-4. The victory or defeat in the ninth game was related to the fate of the second set. Qiu seemed to have lost his center of gravity, and his shots lacked control. He was about to fail with a score of 1-3 when he suddenly perked up, striving upstream and turning the tide. He finally won this game with a score of 8-6. The situation turned suddenly, and people's hearts were at ease. The victory in the last game was expected. Qiu won the second set with a score of 6-4.</p>
<p>Superior Win Over Inferior. In the first game of the third set, Qiu repeatedly hit corner balls, which Defu countered left and right. Later, relying on the effectiveness of his blocks, he gained the upper hand. In the second game, Defu's serve was weak, and his entire army was destroyed, resulting in a 1-1 tie. Each won a game in the third and fourth, with Qiu excelling in composure and Defu relying on winning by volleying. In the fifth game, Qiu showed a lack of strength and was attacked, resulting in defeat. In the sixth to eighth games, Qiu actually played with Defu. His excellent volleying and wonderful positioning left Defu with nothing to do. Qiu then took an extremely advantageous position with a score of 5-3. In the ninth game, Defu fought hard for victory, but finally failed in the rally. In the tenth game, Qiu won again with a score of 6-4. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, Qiu won the championship.

<p>(5) Four Female Players</p>
<p>Three Sets of Intense Battle Divide Ups and Downs</p>
<p>At the beginning of the singles final, there was first a women's doubles final. After a long period of hardship, the difficult and inseparable situation was resolved. Mrs. Fangers and Mrs. Klenoff defeated Miss Corasha and Mrs. Borden with a score of 6-8, 7-5, 7-5. The two teams were evenly matched and difficult to separate. Corasha was the most outstanding, and her backhand volley was unique. The skill of this group was slightly better and should have won, but in the end, Corasha suffered a cramp in her foot and could not run, retreating to the baseline, which led to her defeat. It was a pity. They won the first set 8-6, but lost two sets in a row with scores of 7-5 and 7-5. The intensity of the battle can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Lingnan Wins the Summer Football Championship</h3>
<p>Defeats Huadong in Extra Time</p>
<p>Huadong Loses 1-0, A Pity</p>
<p>The Huadong Company Football Team and Lingnan competed in the final of the Summer Football Tournament (Zhenyuan Cup) yesterday at the China Baseball Field. After 90 minutes of competition, neither side scored. Extra time was played, and Lingnan scored a goal against Huadong in the first 10 minutes. As a result, Lingnan won 1-0 and won the championship, retaining the Zhenyuan Cup for one year.</p>
<p>Thousands of Spectators, Refugees Suffer</p>
<p>Yesterday's match ticket revenue was all used to support the Northeast refugees, but there were only a few spectators, only about 1,500 people, with revenue of only about 500 yuan. Is it the fate of the Northeast refugees to suffer?</p>
<p>Balanced Situation, Wasted Effort</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, Huadong attacked first, and Lingnan's momentum was very strong, repeatedly pressing Huadong. Huadong's defense was ready and did not relax at all. However, because Li Ning committed a handball foul within the penalty area, Lingnan's Chen Jiaqiu took the penalty kick, but the ball bounced off the post. Huadong was lucky to not concede a goal. After this, Huadong's momentum suddenly increased, and they launched an invasion. Li Baojun had two chances, but missed them due to his unskilled feet. In the first half, both sides ran and competed fiercely, and the situation was balanced, with neither side scoring.</p>
<p>Continued Competition, No Gains</p>
<p>In the second half, they switched sides and fought again. Huadong was very excited, with the momentum of a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey. The situation in front of Lingnan's goal was serious. Jiang Shanjing and Feng Yunyou worked hard to defend, preventing Huadong from taking advantage of the situation. Once, Jiang Shanjing and Hu Youcheng fought fiercely for the ball, and Jiang was penalized with a penalty kick. Li Ning took the penalty kick for Huadong, but the ball was sent out of the goal with a light kick. What a missed opportunity! Was it Lingnan's luck, or did Li Ning deliberately do it to give Jiang Shanjing face? Therefore, although Huadong repeatedly attacked, Lingnan also attacked fiercely, and in the end, both sides had nothing to gain. Time ran out, and there was still no winner.</p>
<p>Huadong Changes Players, Loses Life Here</p>
<p>During extra time, Huadong's two tiger generals, Qian Jingyong and Feng Nianhua (Feng performed particularly well yesterday), were unable to continue the game due to foot pain. They were replaced by Mao Honggui and Yang Renwei. In the middle of the player changes and the game, Huadong's line was inevitably dispersed. Lingnan took advantage of this to advance, and the left winger dribbled straight in, reached the edge of Huadong's goal, and sent the ball in front of the goal. Huadong's goalkeeper Lu Zhongen knelt down to save but failed. The ball was scored by Lingnan's center forward Peng Guangxin. Huadong lost his life here. After the substitutions, Huadong still struggled to recover, but failed to do so. In the twilight, Lingnan took home the tall "Zhenyuan Cup." The referee was He Chunhui. Both teams performed well.</p>
<p>Both teams performed well and were worth watching. Lingnan's forwards Chen Hongguang and Chen Jiaqiu were brave and good at fighting. The back had the defense of two famous generals, Feng Yunyou and Jiang Shanjing. Feng Nianhan was also very outstanding. On the Huadong side, Li Baojun missed countless opportunities in the first half, which was a pity. Otherwise, the result may have been reversed. Hu Youcheng and Dong Shaopei were outstanding talents, but they were closely monitored by the opponent and did not get the most out of their performance. The performance of the new players Feng Nianhua and Qian Yaobin was no less than that of the famous player Li Ning, which was very gratifying. In short, Huadong's performance yesterday was no less than Lingnan's, and their failure was due to bad luck. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Lingnan</p>
<p>Hong Tianjue</p>
<p>Feng Nianhan Huang Yifang Chen Hongguang</p>
<p>Qian Guoneng Feng Yunyou Peng Guangxin</p>
<p>Jiang Shanjing Huang Taiming Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Tang Wenwei</p>
<p>Huadong</p>
<p>Yang Renwei (out)</p>
<p>Mao Honggui (out) Qian Jingyong (in)</p>

<h3>Silver Cup Glittering, Youyou Cup Tennis Victory Celebration</h3>
<p>A Grand Event Last Night</p>
<p>The victory celebration for the second Youyou Cup Tennis Tournament was held last night at the Youyou Sports Association on Matte Hess Road. Young heroes gathered, and Hu Junlai presented awards. Large and small silver cups and beautiful medals shone brightly to encourage future generations. The names of the award winners are as follows:</p>

<h3>Lehua Renamed Huale</h3>
<p>Replaced by the Fudan University Team</p>
<p>The Lehua Football Team has lost talent to various teams this year and cannot revive its strength. The Fudan University Football Team intends to use the name Lehua to participate in the Western Football Association, but Yu Hengzhi refused their request. Later, Wang Fudan mediated and contacted the Western Football Association, requesting permission for the Fudan University Team to replace them. The Western Association agreed, but the name Lehua will still be used in the association, and it will be called "Huale" to the outside world. It has been demoted to Group B. This is the situation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Notifies Municipal Schools of the Date of the Fourth Sports Meet</h3>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued orders to the municipal and registered private primary schools in the city, notifying them of the date of the Fourth Primary School Sports Meet and instructing them to pay attention to universal training.

The Fourth Municipal Primary School Joint Sports Meet has been decided to be held on October 27, 28, and 29 at the Municipal First Public Stadium. All sports items and participation methods will be announced as soon as they are determined.

<h3>Lele Football Team's Fifth Inaugural Meeting</h3>
<p>Invites He Chunhui to be the Instructor</p>
<p>The Lele Football Team has been established for five years, and its past achievements have been satisfactory. It has participated in the Shanghai China Football Association League for many years. In the 20th year, it went to Hangzhou and won the Hangzhou Municipal Mi Zhu New Year's Day Championship.

It is heard that the team welcomes friendly matches with all sectors for practice, so as to help each other.</p>
<h3>Municipal Sports Stadium One Small Football Match</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, there were two small football friendly matches at Municipal Sports Stadium One: (1) Shi Tuo defeated Tong Xin, 3-1; (2) Zhiyong defeated Kai Shi, 4-1. New Basketball Techniques (6) (Do Not Reprint) Original by Claire Burcky, Translated jointly by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>The jump ball and the tip-off are very common in basketball games, but the latter is often caused by the former.</p>
<p>A jump ball situation occurs as follows: If a player on the attacking team, under heavy defense, does not show a clear intention to immediately pass the ball and continue the game,</p>
<p>3. Or when the ball is firmly held by two opposing players with one hand or two hands, and they are about to use force against each other, the referee or inspector will blow the whistle.</p>
<h3>Jump Ball</h3>
<p>Tip-off: The ball is tossed up in the center of the two players, allowing the two to jump up and tap it.</p>
<p>If the jump ball occurs within the free throw area, the tip-off must be performed on the free throw line. As for any location in the field where it occurs, the jump ball can be held on the spot.</p>
<p>Officials in the game often declare a jump ball to prevent players from fouling. They blow the whistle in advance when they see a player about to collide with their opponent or grab the opponent holding the ball. This is a false judgment that not only promotes a rough style of play but also makes an unfair ruling against the ball handler.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Quotations from Old Man Ma Xiangbo of September 3rd</h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>"Only sincerity lasts forever!"</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Youren discovered the ink manuscript of Ming sage Sun Yuanhua's letter to Wang Zheng and sent it to Old Man Xiang to request that he write a postscript. Sun Yuanhua and Old Man Xiang, Wang Zheng and Mr. Yu are all fellow villagers of Jiangsu and Shaanxi. Therefore, there is a special sense of admiration for the former sages! Originally, Old Man Xiang wanted to write the postscript himself, and had already instructed to collect twenty or thirty kinds of related texts for reference, but suddenly he fell ill. So this work was handed over to me, and I made a thirty-two-page interpretation!</p>
<p>This is the introduction. Because at the end of this handscroll, Mr. Yu copied a poem by Wang Yilei (Zheng) and Tao Jingjie's "The Return," Old Man Xiang loved this poem so much that he asked Mr. Yu to write another copy and hang it in the dining and reception room of the Le Shan Tang. Thanks to this painting of Mr. Yilei's "The Return," Old Man Xiang gathered several pairs of couplets. Here is a rough record.</p>
<p>A certain Dr. Shen asked for a calligraphic piece, and I wrote a couplet:</p>
<p>"With Heaven as the destination;"</p>
<p>Why seek from the outside."</p>
<p>A certain Committee Member Liu asked for a calligraphic piece, and I wrote another couplet:</p>
<p>"Follow the right path to the top;"</p>
<p>Do not bend or flatter the unrighteous."</p>
<p>Once, Old Man Xiang pointed and asked, "Lightning and flint cannot last long," how should it be paired? After a few days, Old Man Xiang himself said the matching sentence: "Be diligent and cautious in the morning and evening, and you will always be safe."</p>
<p>But there is a sentence with a very good meaning, but it is very difficult to match. That is!</p>
<p>"Only sincerity lasts forever!"</p>
<p>"Note": "Interpretation of Mr. Sun Huoche of the Ming Dynasty's Letter to Mr. Wang Kuixin," published by the Shanghai Xujiahui Tushanwan Printing House: Old Man Xiang wrote the image, Mr. Yu wrote the inscription, and Minister Wang Shisun sealed the cover.</p>
<h3>Lost Territory? In Li</h3>
<p>— Suffocation and Darkness</p>
<p>! Do you know!</p>
<p>On one hand, we are filled with the heroic words of recovering lost territory and restoring our rivers and mountains, but on the other hand, we are worried and afraid that if the robbers have a change of heart, the Japanese Emperor might say: "Chinese people of co-existence and co-prosperity, stop shouting, I will return Manchuria to you, but on one condition, you must be able to accurately say how many li of land you have lost, so that it can be returned in full. You are not allowed to consult geography books." I think at this time, our countrymen must be so anxious that they are scratching their heads and faces, turning red with anxiety, pacing around in circles. Zhang San says more than a thousand li; Li Si says hundreds of thousands of li; Chen Qi says millions of li; while Wang Ba says tens of millions of li! Of course, the robbers will not have a change of heart, so please rest assured. But if the victim wants to recover the lost territory, then at the very least, they should know exactly how many li of land have been lost. Always sending out telegrams saying that millions of li of lost territory will be recovered, issuing declarations that hundreds of thousands of li of rivers and mountains will be restored. If they can't even figure out millions and hundreds of thousands, how can they recover the lost territory? Perhaps they want to be laughed at by foreigners before they can recover it peacefully?</p>
<p>I also know that there are differences between English miles, Chinese li, English square miles, etc. Saying millions and hundreds of thousands may be two but one and one but two. But those who can draft telegrams and declarations certainly have a plan in mind and will not make mistakes, but those who read the telegrams are confused. They might hold the telegram and ask Uncle Zhang next door, saying, "Tell me, how many li have we lost?" I really can't figure it out at all!</p>
<p>The Chinese can lose land in a muddle; the Chinese cannot recover lost land in a muddle. Muddle-headed, muddle-headed for five thousand years.</p>

<h3>District Tiger</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuilin</p>
<p>Anecdotes of Qu Shounian</p>
<p>Qu is from Meixian, Guangdong. He is currently the division commander of the 19th Route Army. He is brave and good at fighting. The Battle of Shanghai made the strong neighbors lose their courage, and his功績 is especially great. My friend Cheng Junfengxi learned about Qu's life anecdotes and told me, so I recorded them.</p>
<p>Meixian is mostly mountainous. Qu liked hunting in his childhood. He often wore a gun to roam around. Later, he joined the army and became proficient in marksmanship and was full of courage and knowledge. He was promoted to battalion commander because of his reputation for capturing bandits. One day, the army was marching in the mountains, and the residents said that there were tigers in the mountains and warned them not to go deep. Qu said that tigers are also harmful to people, so they should be captured immediately. So he took two soldiers with food into the mountains. The next day, they encountered them on the road. The tiger was tall and mighty. When he saw people, he roared angrily. The three of them attacked him from different angles. The two soldiers missed their shots and were almost eaten by the tiger. Finally, Qu shot the tiger from behind and choked it. The two soldiers could hardly walk, so they rested under the tree. Qu thought that the great harm had been removed, so why not go deeper to explore, so he walked alone. After a while, he passed a dark ravine, and suddenly there was another tiger, jumping out of the ravine. Qu was caught off guard and was knocked down, and his left leg was caught by its claws. The tiger opened its mouth and wanted to bite his head. Qu took out his pistol and shot into the tiger's mouth. The tiger jumped and fell to its death, and Qu also broke his leg and could not walk. Soon the two soldiers caught up and carried him back. They lived in Hong Kong for three months before he recovered. To this day, the scar on his left leg is still there, and the villagers often call him District Tiger.</p>
<p>Qu had an uncle who was the commander of the rural army in Meixian. He was also famous for controlling bandits. The bandits hated him. Unfortunately, he was taken advantage of by the ugly class. The corpse was dismembered into several paragraphs and given to his relatives and friends. At that time, Qu was stationed in a neighboring county. He rushed back, vowing revenge. He found out the location of the bandit's nest, took two pistols and two thorns, disguised himself and went to join them, falsely claiming to be a bandit leader from another place. The bandits did not notice and regarded him as one of their own. He lived in their nest for several months and got to know everyone. One day, all the bandits gathered in a certain house in a certain village to discuss committing a crime in a certain place. Qu secretly reported to the stationed army and went to capture them at night, and agreed to fire a gun to respond from the inside. At midnight, the bandits were gathering to discuss, and they faintly heard the sound of the outside world. Qu pretended and said that he was afraid of an alarm, so he asked to go and see first. The bandits praised his courage. Qu went out, fired a gun, and the ambushers rose up, and all the bandits were captured, without missing any, and were all executed. From this, the name of District Tiger spread throughout the Chaozhou region.</p>
<h3>About the Confucius Temple Park</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>This is what a park should be</p>
<p>It is said that there have been several parks in Shanghai for a long time, but you have to pay a one-yuan head tax every year. This is of course "a drop in the bucket" for the playboys, but it is a problem for the average worker, right?</p>
<p>There also seems to be a park on the banks of the Suzhou River that doesn't cost money, but it's desolately desolate. There, apart from a thatched pavilion, there are only a few standing trees, and the rest of the ground is covered with yellow sand. If no one tells you, "This is the only 'public' park in Shanghai," then no matter how smart you are, you won't know. I think:</p>
<p>In the near past, the Confucius Temple Park was opened, opened without charging any fees. Of course, there are many visitors, needless to say.</p>
<p>Someone said, "The French 'garden' is a middle-aged old woman, the Zhao Feng 'garden' is a charming little girl, and the Bund 'garden' is a passionate young woman." What about our Confucius Temple "public" park? It is a scholar.</p>
<p>Really, in the Confucius Temple Park, not only do you feel the freshness of the air, but it will also tell you what kind of flower or tree this is, which category and which family it belongs to. And, in the 128 Memorial Room, you can see a 600-pound weight bomb, you can see the various trophies that the loyal and brave soldiers exchanged with iron and blood, you can see the amulets of those cowardly beasts. Here, you will hear the tragic cries of the soldiers defending the country, repeating and shouting in your ears: Other than that, it will tell you the utensils for worshiping Confucius and some common sense of hygiene.</p>
<p>There, there is a palace-style library full of oriental beauty. The cleanliness of the interior will make you feel supreme pleasure. I think: In this beautiful environment, holding a book and reading quietly is really the best thing.</p>
<p>Finally, I have to tell you that you don't have to pay a head tax here! This is a park that lives up to its name.</p>
<h3>Rotary Club Enters Customs with Postal Companions in the Novel</h3>
<p>— Owner of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Here, let me talk about the Xiaoxibianmen gate; it is located between the Xiaoximen Gate and the Japanese Station. To the west of the Bianmen Gate, there is also a Chinese concession area, which is connected to the Japanese Station. To the east of the Bianmen Gate is the Xiaoxiguan area, which leads directly to the city gate of Xiaoximen. It is located in a suitable place. Although the name is also a gate, the outer city and city gate ruins have long been filled and become roads; even if this Bianmen Gate still exists alone, it is not the original form of the city gate, but rather similar to the memorial archways of Beijing. However, the Beijing memorial archways are very beautiful and grand, usually with four vermilion pillars and a roof seat; it only has two wooden pillars and a carved door lintel, and the construction is much simpler and plainer. But there is something worth staying there. After exiting the Bianmen Gate, there is the old Shenyang City Station of the Beining Railway, and a park a little further away. In the park, there are towering ancient trees, and the scenery is extremely quiet and secluded; although there are not many buildings such as pavilions and towers, there is a pavilion. It is said that Guo Songling once displayed his body there for people to view, and ordinary tourists do not like to linger there; but standing on the stone base along the edge of the pavilion, looking southwest, there is a very tall clock tower in the distance, which is the Shenyang Postal Administration.</p>
<p>Why mention the Postal Administration? Because the Postal Administration is closest to this park, and after exiting the main entrance of the Postal Administration, walking east for less than two li, you will come to this park. It seems that all kinds of local people are not very interested in visiting this gloomy park with trees, and it is difficult to come to this park for a tour. Just like all streams returning to the valley, they drive past the front of the Postal Administration to the famous Beishi Market Amusement Park in the northwest corner, listening to big operas, Ping operas, and various miscellaneous performances. Only the postal workers and postal students who work in the Postal Administration, most of whom are young people of the new China, pay the most attention to going to a quiet place to breathe fresh air, and use walking to exercise their physical strength, so they have different preferences from others, and dislike the noisy and vulgar amusement park, and become the unique tourists in this park. This was two years ago; that year was the 19th year of the Republic of China, in a very hot dog day, after 4 o'clock in the afternoon, some of the personnel of the Postal Administration got off work. The summer days are long, and the scorching sun is still high in the sky like a fire umbrella, as if it will scorch the earth before it is willing to stop. These people will only live a stuffy life like a steamer if they go home, so they all think of the park where they usually go for a walk; only some shade of the trees there is relatively cool and can rest a little, so they all run to the park at the same time. Looking around after entering the park gate, all they can see are colleagues of their kind wearing suits or Zhongshan suits. The footprints of leather shoes and alum cloth shoes crisscross the park.</p>

<h3>Small News from the Yarn and Cotton Markets</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market saw a slight increase due to resales of American cotton, boosting confidence slightly. There was some covering of short positions, but actual demand was less than yesterday, so the overall situation remained soft. There was still nothing exciting to report in the market, and the overall trend remained one of consolidation. However, spot yarn inventory was very low, so the market situation was more expensive than the cotton market.</p>
<p>People's Standard Rises by 7 Candareens. The market opened higher on American cotton.</p>
<p>Shanghai: Market sentiment tightened slightly, with prices rising by 6, 7, and 9 candareens across various months. The afternoon market remained scattered, with prices flat across the board. The total volume traded for the day was 13,450 bales. Yi Chang sold 2,700 bales, and Tian Long sold 600 bales. On the buying side, Da Feng bought 650 bales, Chang Feng bought 450 bales, and Tong He bought 450 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Outstanding Accounts: 11493, up 6, 153,900. October 150, long, up 7, 55,800. November 1494, 635,600.</p>
<p>November 1494, 784,600. 314971...</p>
<p>December 1491, 495,600. Total 425,500.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales are Ordinary. Spot yarn sales are sluggish.</p>
<p>The total amount bought by various firms for the day was 292 bales, with prices remaining flat, similar to the previous day. The purchasing amounts by various parties are listed below:</p>
<p>Lu Zhou 85, Inland 57, Ningbo 10, Zhenjiang 10, Shantou 30.</p>
<p>Nanjing 5, Fujian 5, Guangdong 50, Anqing 10, Same Trade 30.</p>
<p>A Bullish Cotton Market</p>
<p>The cotton market trended firmer due to rising American cotton prices, boosting confidence. The near-month market became increasingly strong. Because there were too many shorts, although a certain manufacturer sold short more than 40,000 piculs in October alone, the Yong An mill bought 30,000 piculs, and the two sides still had considerable resistance. The current climate is very favorable for the new cotton crop to come to market, but the selling price of cottonseed cotton is unwilling to be low. Therefore, those selling futures contracts of 32 taels of standard cotton are relatively scarce. The situation of American cotton is also changing. Zheng Standard is Up Half a Liang. Zheng Standard opened higher due to the rising trend of American cotton. Sellers were scarce and individual investors covered short positions. Prices rose by 3, 4, and 5 candareens across various months, and then rose by another 5 fen to 1 candareen in the afternoon. The total volume traded for the day was 54,700 piculs. Da Fu sold 3,600 piculs, Yuan Da sold 2,800 piculs, Chang Feng sold 2,000 piculs, and Yi Chang sold 1,600 piculs. On the buying side, Yuan Xing Chang bought 5,400 piculs, Tong He bought 2,300 piculs, Xin Chang bought 2,300 piculs, and Ji Feng bought 1,500 piculs. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>American Cotton Hovered with a Weak Tone Last Week</p>
<p>There are Reports of Rotting in Both Southern and Western Cotton Bolls</p>
<p>A New York telegram dated September 30th reported on the cotton market situation for the week: After stabilizing for some time this week, cotton prices turned weaker due to good weather in the cotton belt and slightly more selling in the South. Southern private cotton production reports, West Texas and the Western parts of the states have reports of boll rot. The first delivery notice for October is approximately 56,900 bales, but Chu Zai 2 and Zhong Xin Long Piao American cotton will be shipped to Liverpool or the mainland. It is heard that the Japanese have already purchased some October cotton in New Orleans. Reports of cotton farmers hoarding futures contracts continue, and the basis price remains stable. However, some people believe that the basis price may loosen after the September contract is fulfilled. There are concerns in the market that hedging may increase, so they dare not buy. However, the decline in market prices has attracted some buying, based on optimism about the general trade prospects. At the same time, the government's next cotton production report (scheduled to be released on October 8th) is still uncertain, so the cotton market is generally sluggish. Attached is the weekend statistics as follows (unit: thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1931, 1932</p>
<p>Cumulative listings this season, 2,198, 2,274</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources from various firms in southern Shanghai arrived at more than 20 locations, but the inventory in Pudong was still high, and confidence was not strong. Due to the approaching Double Ninth Festival, the market trended downwards. After all, the inventory in foreign rice warehouses was high, and the scattered miscellaneous rice was less than 500 piculs. The opening price in the morning for various goods was discounted by about 2 jiao.</p>
<p>About 35 or 36 locations arrived at Xinzha West Road. Trading on this street was not active. Liyang, Jiangyin, and Bacheng goods each fell by 3 jiao. Kiln-grown thin rice and wharf tips also fell by more than 2 jiao. The top goods from the Northern firms did not fluctuate in price. The total amount of miscellaneous rice in the city was about 2,800 dan.</p>
<h3>Northern Firms Trialing Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were inquiries about foreign rice from buyers, because after the market price repeatedly declined, the market had reached a bottom, and sellers were no longer eager to reduce prices to sell. The situation had temporarily stabilized. However, because resale was not profitable, major firms did not pay attention. The market on this street was even more sluggish yesterday, with no transactions even for a single bag. Northern firms tentatively purchased 444 bags of cheap rice at 9 yuan and 2 jiao and 2 fen, and Min Dang 300 bags at a price of 9 yuan and 2 jiao and 7 fen. There were no other transactions. It is said that even these Siam Siam and Min Dang rice have not been traded for more than a month.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Declines Step by Step</h3>
<p>Major Factories Unanimously Dumped... Over 100,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was sluggish across all months after the opening in the morning. Because the quotation for foreign wheat had fallen by 3 or 4 jiao in the past two days, and spot prices were stabilizing step by step, and the United States had a large surplus of wheat available for loan, most people were unanimously bearish. However, factory sales were not strong, and the market situation was still stable. By the afternoon opening, prices for all months continued to decline because major factories unanimously dumped over 100,000 bags. The general buyers were like startled birds, unable to resist, and the market sentiment became sluggish. According to the current situation, there is pressure from foreign wheat on the outside and squeezing from low rice prices on the inside. The future situation is still difficult to be optimistic about. As a result, this month fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous day, the previous month fell by 2.5 fen, December fell by 2 fen, January fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li, February fell by 1.5 fen, and March initially opened at 1 liang, 9 qian, and 1 fen and 2.5 li, and the subsequent market also fell by 1 fen.</p>
<p>Wheat Market Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market was generally flat and weak in the morning and afternoon after opening. The quotation for foreign wheat fell by 3 or 4 jiao in the past two days, so most people were naturally uncertain. However, because the number of chips in the market was really dry, both the bulls and the bears had few large numbers. Therefore, although the sentiment was not good and the environment was not good, trading was ultimately quiet. As a result, this month fell by 1 fen compared to the previous month's closing price, November fell by 1 fen, December fell by 2 fen, January fell by 3 fen, and February fell by 2 fen. The spot wheat market has turned stable, but prices remain firm. Kai Yao Wan wheat is priced at 3 liang, 5 qian, and 67 fen, for 300 bags.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>A New Feng Foreign Firm report stated that on Friday (30th), Chicago wheat fell across all months due to speculators selling off. The volume traded on the 29th totaled 30 million bushels. The closing prices for the 30th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price, Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>September, 51.250, Down 0.5</p>
<p>December, 53.375, Down 0.5</p>
<p>May, 58.500, Down 0.5</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<h3>Red and Green Tea Sales are Sluggish and Prices are Low</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market saw sluggish sales of red and green box teas from various regions. Only Tunxi, Buxin, and Zhenmei teas saw some negotiations throughout the city, but the opening price was said to have been reduced to 120 taels outside the customs. The situation is extremely pessimistic with one fall after another. However, in the case of the African route, very little Zhenmei has been exported this year. Currently, inquiries for tea from that route are still constant from local tea merchants regarding Gongse Zhenmei, probably due to economic reasons and failure to develop. It is still not possible to be completely hopeless.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, Xinghua Dried Longan First Market Has Opened</h3>
<p>Over 10,000 pieces of Xinghua dried longan have arrived in recent days. The first market opened yesterday. The standard Jiechun Zheng Er was priced at 51 taels, the bucket full was 55 taels, Xingji was 27 taels, Xingkai was 23 taels, and thousands of other miscellaneous longan were also opened. The top grade did not fluctuate much, while the middle and lower grades each fell by a small amount of taels to a few qian. The market sentiment is stable for high-quality goods due to the low inventory, while the middle and lower-quality goods are very flat and weak due to the sufficient inventory.</p>
<h3>Metals, a Large Batch of Tinplate is About to Be Sold</h3>
<p>It is heard that the Construction Committee's 20,000+ boxes of 90-pound British tinplate, whose collateral loan has expired, will be sold by the Committee in conjunction with the Boxer Indemnity Committee this month. Therefore, the extremely consolidated market has a semblance of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside. The current market price is 10 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen per box. If selling on credit, then it is 10 taels and 5 qian. It is heard that the Construction Committee's asking price is between 9 taels, 2 qian, 5 fen and 9 taels, 5 qian per box. However, the surface must be more than 3,000 boxes.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Sheet Price Increases by 2 Qian 5 Fen</h3>
<p>Due to the low inventory of black iron sheets and the scarcity of arrivals, various firms were very active in procuring them. Therefore, the market supply could not meet demand. The standard has therefore been very bullish, estimated at 9 taels per dan, up 2 qian and 5 fen from before. However, the Tianjin firms have been very eager to procure them in recent days, so there has also been a lot of discussion about future contracts. It is heard that the trade has sold over a thousand boxes of goods, with the price being around 9 taels and 5 qian per dan.</p>
<h3>Coal, Kailuan Coal Plummets by 2 Taels</h3>
<p>The market price of Kailuan lump coal plummeted by 2 taels yesterday due to the encroachment of Japanese coal sales and the accumulation of inventory. The price fell from 8 taels and 5 qian to 6 taels and 5 qian per ton. Coal dust also fell slightly, with current sales at 8 taels for No. 1 dust and 7 taels and 8 qian for No. 2 dust.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Zai Li Petitions for Investigation of Son and Daughter-in-law</h3>
<p>— A Buddhist</p>
<p>According to a Beiping telegram yesterday, Zai Li, the father of the traitorous Puyi, has again petitioned the municipal government to pay attention to investigating his son and daughter-in-law, Pu Tang and Shi Xia, in order to pursue the 3 to 4 million yuan in property that they forcibly took away.</p>
<p>I don't need to investigate where Zai Li's property came from. I am also unclear about the details of how Pu Tang and Shi Xia took away this property. However, I previously saw in the newspaper that Puyi had said that the second wife of the second household was shameless and stole 500,000 to 600,000 yuan worth of antiques to enjoy herself in Shanghai. Is the second wife Puyi was referring to Pu Tang Shi Xia? Why did Puyi only mention his brother's wife and not his brother? Perhaps there are still problems in it.</p>
<p>"Good fortune never comes in pairs, but misfortune never comes alone." Zai Li's eldest son, the traitor Puyi, robbed 30 million people and tens of millions of square miles of land outside the customs, offering them to the Japanese with both hands, and he himself willingly became a prisoner-style executive. His crime is far more serious than Pu Tang and Shi Xia. Although Pu Tang and Shi Xia plundered 3 to 4 million, this property is still private property and has nothing to do with the country. Zai Li did not petition the municipal government to issue an arrest warrant for Puyi, but repeatedly petitioned to arrest Pu Tang and Shi Xia. He is truly observing the tip of an autumn hair but not seeing a cartload of firewood, punishing a thief who steals a hook but making a country thief a lord. Zai Li's vision is too short.</p>
<p>It turns out that "If the superiors are not upright, the subordinates will be uneven." If the elder brother is not like an elder brother, the younger brother will not be like a younger brother. If the father is not like a father, the son will not be like a son. How many "petty thieves" have come out of Zai Li's family? It's not just the men who are like this, but the women are also no exception. Pu Tang Shi Xia conspired with her husband to plunder property, and Puyi's concubine Wen Xiu fought a lawsuit with Puyi, wanting to sever their husband-concubine relationship. Zai Li's misfortune is truly also our country's misfortune.</p>

<h3>I Have a Long Sword</h3>
<p>— Cheng Luding</p>
<p>Melted into hundred-refined steel, forged from thousands of piculs of iron, the light of flowers is brilliant and the cold of autumn, thunder rumbles and lightning strikes again, relying on the sky, the sky is empty, the ground is cracked, gods and ghosts cry in the darkness, the heavens and earth lose color, often severing the heads of traitors, and still sucking the blood of Japanese slaves, awakening the dream of China, smashing the lack of Mount Fuji, holding the movement of the stars in hand, what a heroic and outstanding state, I have a long sword, my ambition is to cleanse China.</p>
<p>To Zhao Cheng Yumu</p>
<p>Few days apart at the parting, emotions are moved by loneliness, the deserted spring in March, wandering at midnight for the fifth watch, the joy of writing is short, the wind and rain are sad and deep, putting down the pen and remembering you in vain, when will we continue our old alliance,</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Has Humanity Occupied the Seabed?</h3>
<p>— Jin Xin</p>
<p>Humanity, relying on science, has broken through the mysteries set by nature and the various restrictions placed upon it, one by one. Six miles in the air, the immeasurable universe, and the vast ocean, we already have the ability to go up and down, guess and transcend. Therefore, people generally cannot help but commit some megalomania, thinking that we have conquered the sky and the seabed and become the masters of the entire universe. In fact, human ability is still very small! Now, let’s start with the conquest of the seabed. Since the invention of submarines, people have had a tool to reach the seabed. However, the deeper the dive, the greater the pressure. There is a place in the Pacific Ocean that is six miles deep, and the depth record in the Atlantic Ocean can reach five miles, and the Mediterranean Sea can reach three miles. In those places, the pressure is as high as 14,000 pounds to 7,000 pounds per square inch. Humanity’s existing knowledge cannot enable them to go there. Our lack of ability to overcome the seabed can also be fully demonstrated by several seabed projects! The project to cross the Atlantic waterline, the salvage of sunken ships, and the rescue work of stealth boats, etc., so sometimes entire boxes of gold bars have to be left on the seabed. Last year, a British submarine sank near Yantai, and an entire ship of soldiers had to be buried alive. The Atlantic waterline was installed for seven years, and these are all facts. Underwater work generally uses diving suits. The earliest ones were made of rubber. Wearing this kind of clothing, one can move freely on a sunken ship and work at will. However, one cannot enter the water too deeply. It is definitely beyond what people can withstand below 120 feet. Later, someone used a sealed iron box for divers to live in, and then installed air pipes and exhaust pipes. Sometimes, several bottles of compressed oxygen and a gas purifier are attached to absorb the carbonic acid gas. In this box, the air pressure is the same as usual, and the diver is not directly subjected to the water’s squeezing. This is its advantage. The underwater sightseeing that is currently popular in Long Beach, California, also uses this type of diving device, which is also equipped with four masks, so that even if this four-foot diameter iron box is dropped on the seabed, they can continue to maintain it for up to three days. At the same time, the diver can abandon the iron block at the bottom of the box, and its buoyancy can also allow it to come up. A diving box manufactured by a British company uses a gas filter, so that the diver can use the air in it again and again. With this type of diving box, it is not restricted by water pressure, and can freely go up and down in the deep sea at 400 to 500 feet. Electric lights and telephones are installed on it, and it is lifted to the seabed by a crane, becoming the eye of the seabed. The diver can then arbitrarily command the use of other cranes and tools. The recent retrieval of gold coins from the sunken Egyptian ship is a notable example of the application of this type of diving device to underwater work.</p>
<p>The steel armor diving suit invented by a German middle school teacher can be said to combine the advantages of both. Its armor is made of light alloys such as aluminum steel, and the diver is not subject to the pressure of the outside water. At the same time, ball bearings are installed at the joints, which can both roll and stretch. This can be said to be the latest type of powerful weapon for underwater operations.</p>
<p>However, the construction of diving boxes encounters engineering difficulties due to the extremely high pressure in the deep seabed, and is still impossible at present.</p>
<p>Improved Society Discussion Group</p>
<h3>Improving Gift Giving Discussion Group</h3>
<p>— Zi Cai</p>
<p>Whether it is an individual or a family, when relatives and friends have happy or sad events, they must send a gift! Money or valuables! To express congratulations or condolences, this is also "reciprocity," which is unavoidable in life. Therefore, the individual or family economic budget table includes an entertainment fee item, which is regarded as a legitimate expenditure. However, in modern society, the custom of luxury prevails, and gift-giving is no exception, becoming more and more lavish day by day. Especially in large cities, ordinary people often take a few dollars as "commonplace" and are not surprised. If you don't give gifts to a few families in a month, the amount is quite considerable, and those who are not very economically affluent become panicked and sigh that "giving gifts is difficult." It seems to be better in rural areas. Although there are still "old people gifts" of a few hundred coins and two jiao, most of them are gradually increasing, or adding some valuables! Gift certificates, gifts, etc. To trace the meaning of giving gifts, it is just to "express affection," and grandiosity is not necessary. Moreover, everyone has the idea of "returning a peach for a plum," so the more lavish the gift, the more lavish the return, and the losses, banquets, and travel expenses also become greater. Both parties suffer economic losses, which is really unnecessary! I remember a teacher saying the following passage before:</p>
<p>"I can say that I don't have any entertainment expenses. At first, many relatives and friends' invitation cards and obituaries flew in like snowflakes, but I didn't even look at them and threw them into the wastebasket. Of course, I didn't give gifts. Later, the invitation cards and obituaries gradually decreased, and now it can be said that there are none at all. Because my relatives and friends are not short of money, nor do they want me to give them a few dollars, so why should I give them?" One morning, I heard a very tragic crying sound coming from outside. Feeling unbearable, I went out to take a look. It turned out that the old man of a tofu shop next door had died of illness last night. His old mother and wife were crying very sadly because the family was extremely poor and had no money to pay for the funeral. When I learned about it, I took twenty dollars and sent it to them as funeral expenses. Undoubtedly! Their entire family, old and young, were extremely grateful!"</p>
<p>This teacher's words and actions are somewhat "overcorrecting," but his hatred of general gift-giving and his belief that it is necessary to improve it are very worthy of our attention! Especially in this time of economic depression and economic recession, gift-giving is even more necessary to be actively improved! Now I will write down a few opinions that I have thought of:</p>
<p>1. Give according to your ability, the amount should be within one yuan! The same goes for valuables.</p>
<p>2. "Old people gifts" do not need to be increased. Those that have already been increased may still be reduced.</p>
<p>3. The giver does not expect a return, and the receiver does not need to answer.</p>
<p>4. Send in person! Find a way to send it if it's far away. 5. Written works replace money.</p>
<p>The above opinions are said from the perspective of the general public! The wealthy and rich are of course excluded! If members of this association think that this issue is worth discussing, let's all express our opinions, discuss and study it together, so as to improve it. This is what I sincerely hope!</p>
<p>Random Musings</p>
<h3>This Embarrassing Moment</h3>
<p>— Xiang Rong</p>
<p>When rushing to pay the bill, I touched my pocket and realized I forgot to bring cash, only a few copper coins.</p>
<p>Stepping into a social gathering, I remembered I ate a lot of chives during dinner earlier.</p>
<p>When I sat down on the tram, I discovered I hadn't buttoned my Western-style trousers.  Sitting opposite me was a lady...  spent an hour or two putting on makeup, choosing clothes and shoes.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>After putting in the effort to dress up and looking in the mirror, thinking she looked satisfactory, she walked gracefully onto the street and heard someone behind her say, "Monster."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Forgetting that I was wearing completely foreign attire, I used all my energy to tell people that national salvation should start with promoting domestic goods. While discussing this, I was stared at, and then I realized I needed to lower my tone...</p>
<p>After urinating by the wall, just as I was fastening my belt, I turned around and saw a large Indian man with a nightstick coming.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Speaking boastfully to a group of people, unaware that my creditor was sitting quietly beside me...</p>
<p>Just as I was performing the teacher's awkward mannerisms, the teacher unknowingly entered the classroom amidst the loud laughter of the students.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It was getting late, and to show off, I encouraged my little companions by saying, "My mother doesn't dare hit me." Continuing, "My father knows the foreign 'three-dao-tou,' yesterday he brought a lot of foreign toys and sweets." Then I felt a rap on my head and heard my mother scolding, "Stop bragging, you little brat!"</p>
<p>Family Problems</p>
<p>Also One of the Solutions</p>
<p>After dinner one day, she went for a walk alone on S Road. When she returned, she said to her mother:</p>
<p>"Mom, I really had bad luck today. I ran into some 'bai xiang' people. They saw that I didn't look like a Shanghai person at all, thinking I was new to the city, because living in Shanghai requires extremely fashionable attire. Moreover, dressing in a colorful and unique way is also a way to be looked up to. Wearing plain clothes like I do, naturally, people will look down on me and want to play with me!"</p>
<p>"Yunqin, what you said is right. Shanghai people are indeed like that, but your father's income is limited, and there aren't many savings in our family. You are bound to suffer a little in terms of clothing, after all, appearances do matter." After hearing her mother's words, she seemed disappointed. She lowered her head for a moment, then raised it and said:</p>
<p>"Mom, then am I going to live like this?" If you never let me go out, that's acceptable." She went back inside.</p>
<p>"Yunqin, come… come… come quickly. Everything can be discussed, why be so impatient. I think your demands are reasonable, but your father isn't here at the moment, so we'll have to wait for him to decide."</p>
<p>"Mom, what exactly is it going to be? Otherwise, I'll go somewhere else." She became increasingly embarrassed while threatening her mother.</p>
<p>"Yunqin, my darling, you're our only treasure. We rely on you entirely in our old age. If you abandon us, how will we live! I think your father will definitely grant your request." "If he doesn't agree…"</p>
<p>"Then, I'll…"</p>
<p>Seeing that her mother was just muddling through, she felt that there would be no good outcome. She thought that she needed to threaten her further to make her plan succeed. "Mom, I'm definitely leaving. I wish you good health!" After she said that, she looked like she was about to leave.</p>
<p>Her appearance frightened her mother. She hurriedly got up to stop her and said, "Yunqin, I'll solve this problem for you. If you behave yourself at home, even the most difficult problem can be solved."</p>
<p>Her plan was successful.</p>
