<h3 id="c1">讀中國銀行二十度報告（三）彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>由於世界經濟恐慌狂潮之脅迫。在國際盟中已高喊出『經濟復興自中國』之口號。并已擬具開發中國之種種計劃。日本已由經濟的侵略。進而爲武力的掠奪。美則高呼『門户開放。機會均等』。此次國聯之處置東北事件。其勾心鬥角。煞費苦心蓋亦昭然顯呈於吾人之眼前。至於如中國銀行報告所指陳之中國爲用銀之國。銀價跌落。物價降低宜可增加出口。抑止進口。而事實上乃適得其反之現象。正自有其必然。而非爲不可解索之謎。即如七月間之洪水泛濫。其根因亦不外乎一由於先進資本主義經濟之侵蝕中國農村經濟。使其無力改善農業。預防水旱再由於國内政治不上軌道。政府不負責任。勇於内爭。不肯致力於濬河治淮及種種災禍之預防。故一九三一年中國之所以特感動盪衰落困頓不堪者。乃爲承受凋敝世界空前之震　力之故。銀行業之衰落。其根因要亦不外此。</p>
<p>至我政府以根基脆弱。故對外無力自主。對内更無力扶植農工故報告書所。言『爲救濟絲業政府一方面曾發行絲業公債八百萬元。而另一方面即增加出口稅每包三十元。』與『國民經濟有如是之重大病症。政府猶熟視無睹』諸現象。要皆有其必然。</p>
<p>在如此情勢之下。中國而欲挽救危亡。而欲政治清明社會漸臻於繁榮。必從上述諸現象中把握其病根同時更把握時代潮流之趨向。與大衆之要求。</p>
<p>謀求其根本之解决此則吾人所願提與中行諸君子共同商討之一端也。　　至於報告書第三部。所論世界繁榮復興之道。其所陳述各點。如生產過剩。如關稅壁壘。如現金分配不均等率皆爲資本主義所必不可避免之矛盾分析亦極爲正確。但其末段所謂無論世界問題。東方問題其受病源。錯綜紛紜。</p>
<p>决非局部治療所可解决。根本之道。端在人類心理之澈底變換。世界各國國民應變易其十八九世紀偏狹利已之國家思想。中國尤應變易其陳腐之心理。與猜忌自大之心理。庶可以化除一切衝突與誤解。庶可以謀世界之繁榮復興。吾人則認爲此種絕對之唯心論。實不敢贊同。蓋心理之變易。爲基於物質環境。換言之。即人類社會之道德文化。槪爲以經濟爲基礎之上層建築物。即今日人類心理之利已偏狹。亦恰爲資本主義敎育所養成。在資本主義經濟制度下。人類之心理。决無變易之可能。而欲以此恢復世界之繁榮。則更有若『烏托邦』之幻夢吾人認爲今日而欲挽救世界之凋敝。必得澈底改造世界。具體言之。即必改革已盡完其歷史命之世界經濟制度。而代之以合乎大衆利益之制度。此又吾人敢提與中行諸君子共同討論之一端也。</p>
<p>國聯調查團昨參觀戰地</p>
<p>上午歷遍閘北眞茹江灣</p>

<p>第二線由曁南大學出發、經大</p>
<p>統路·新民路·而至北火車站、日軍預在站内月台欄布作小室、桌上陳一大地圖、由一日軍官說明當時作戰情形、李頓爵士詢問頗詳、並以爲向無抵抗能力之平民、抛擲炸彈、似無必要、歷一小時之久、始退出、乃經界路·寳山路·而至商務印書館、凡鋼骨水泥之屋、牆垣猶存、調查</p>
<p>團乃登東方圖書館各樓略觀、多爲歎惜不置、</p>
<p>第三線由東方圖書館出、經北四川路底·天通庵車站·靑雲路·同濟路·横浜路·三陽路·西寳興路·柳營路·水電路·體育會西路·而至江灣跑馬廳、日人引調查團至屋頂、說明附近作戰情形、又往勞動大學及江灣車站一觀、跑馬塲内現有美國商團四人駐守、時已下午一時有半、乃往黄興路·翔殷路·寗國路·平凉路·而至公大纱廠、日軍司令部在焉、調查團盥洗後、先入客室小憇、旋由白川大將招待至樓下進冷食、白川問李頓爵士、尚須往吳淞否、爵士不置可否、顧維鈞張祥麟均謂吳淞地位甚重要、必須往觀、爵士乃意决、至三時辭出、</p>
<p>第四線出公大紗廠、即沿軍工路而至吳淞、軍工路上、日軍入來甚頻、沿江一　帶、純爲防禦遺迹、而鎭上房屋、已全被轟毀、有如大地震以後、較閘北爲尤慘、三時五十分找砲台、砲基我炸毀、砲管多擊繼、舊砲且有移去者經一小時退出、乃經軍工路·平凉路·百老匯路·而回華懋飯店、時已五時半矣、是日因便於觀覽、除麥考益少將有微恙、乘轎車外、餘皆無蓬、適沿途風沙大作、故回滬後諸人對鏡、均彷佛黑人矣、</p>

        <h1>1932.03.22</h1>
<h3 id="e1">Reading the Twentieth Report of the Bank of China (3) Bin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Due to the threatening tide of the world economic panic, the slogan "Economic revival from China" has been loudly proclaimed among the international allies. Various plans for developing China have also been drafted. Japan has advanced from economic aggression to armed plunder. The United States is vociferously advocating "Open Door, Equal Opportunity." The power struggles and painstaking efforts in the League of Nations' handling of the Northeast Incident are also clearly evident to us. As for the point made in the Bank of China's report that China, as a silver-using country, should increase exports and suppress imports due to the fall in silver prices and the decline in commodity prices, the fact that the opposite is happening has its own inevitability and is not an unfathomable mystery. For example, the floods in July were rooted in the erosion of China's rural economy by advanced capitalist economies, leaving it unable to improve agriculture and prevent droughts and floods. Furthermore, the domestic politics are not on the right track, the government is irresponsible, brave in internal strife, and unwilling to devote itself to dredging rivers, controlling the Huai River, and preventing various disasters. Therefore, the reason why China in 1931 was particularly turbulent, declining, and struggling was because it was bearing the unprecedented shock of a dilapidated world. The decline of the banking industry is also rooted in this.</p>
<p>As for our government, because its foundation is weak, it is unable to be independent externally and even more unable to support farmers and workers internally. Therefore, the report states: "To rescue the silk industry, the government issued silk industry bonds of 8 million yuan on the one hand, while on the other hand, it increased the export tax by 30 yuan per bale." And "The national economy has such major ailments, yet the government turns a blind eye." All these phenomena have their own inevitability.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, if China wants to save itself from danger and decline, and if it wants to achieve political clarity and gradually move towards prosperity, it must grasp the root causes of these phenomena while also grasping the trends of the times and the demands of the masses.</p>
<p>Seeking a fundamental solution to this is one aspect that we hope to discuss with the gentlemen of the Bank of China. As for the third part of the report, which discusses the path to world prosperity and revival, the points it makes, such as overproduction, tariff barriers, and the uneven distribution of cash, are all inevitable contradictions of capitalism, and the analysis is extremely accurate. However, its final paragraph states that regardless of world problems or Eastern problems, the sources of illness are complex and diverse.</p>
<p>Local treatment cannot solve them. The fundamental way lies in the thorough transformation of human psychology. The people of all countries in the world should change their narrow and self-serving nationalistic thinking of the 18th and 19th centuries. China should especially change its outdated mentality and suspicious and arrogant psychology. Only then can all conflicts and misunderstandings be resolved, and only then can world prosperity and revival be achieved. We, however, believe that this kind of absolute idealism is truly something we dare not agree with. The change in psychology is based on the material environment. In other words, the moral culture of human society is generally a superstructure based on economics. The selfish and narrow-mindedness of today's human psychology is precisely cultivated by capitalist education. Under the capitalist economic system, human psychology cannot be changed. To restore world prosperity in this way is even more like a utopian dream. We believe that if we want to save the world from its decline today, we must thoroughly transform the world. Specifically, we must reform the world economic system that has completed its historical mission and replace it with a system that meets the interests of the masses. This is another point that we dare to propose for joint discussion with the gentlemen of the Bank of China.</p>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team Visited the Battlefield Yesterday</p>
<p>Spent the Morning Touring Zhabei, Zhenru, and Jiangwan</p>
<p>In the Afternoon, Our Representative Strongly Advocated Going to Wusong</p>
<p>The Scenery Everywhere was Desolate, as After a Major Earthquake</p>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team gathered at the Cathay Hotel at 9 AM yesterday and set off by car, guided by personnel sent by the Japanese military headquarters. Team leader Lord Lytton and German Dr. Schnee sat in the first car, American Major General McCoy and Japanese Yoshida in the second car, American Major General McCoy and Japanese representative Yoshida in the third car, and Zhang Xianglin, director of general affairs of the Chinese delegation, and Shiozaki, secretary-general of the Japanese delegation, in the same car. The Chinese side also included Wang Jingqi, consultant; Ge Gongzhen, specialized committee member; and Zhang Tingrong. The Japanese side included the secretary-general of the Yoshida representative, and others. Wu Xiufeng, the Chinese secretary of the League of Nations, also accompanied them. Italian team member Count Macordi did not go due to illness, and Secretary-General Haas stopped going due to business, represented by the Deputy Secretary-General. They successively inspected Zhenru, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places. Paramount and other American film companies specially dispatched specialists to film the investigation team with sound. Filming took place at Jinan University in Zhenru, the Commercial Press in Zhabei, Jiangwan Station, in front of Labor University, and in Wusong.</p>
<p>The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>First Line: After departing from the Cathay Hotel, they passed through North Sichuan Road, Baoxing Road, Baoshan Road, Baotong Road, and Zhongxing Road to Zhenru. The Baoyi Road area was filled with rubble and devoid of people. Japanese soldiers were stationed at all key traffic points. Defensive works were visible everywhere in Zhenru. After the investigation team got off the bus at Jinan University, each Japanese officer gave them an English Japanese military operation map and explained that the Japanese army came here to station after the Chinese army retreated. They then briefly viewed Zhiyuan Hall and the Hongnian Library. Outside the side door of the library, there was a slogan opposing the investigation team's visit to China, which the Japanese deliberately held up to show to the people in the investigation team as propaganda material.</p>
<p>Second Line: Starting from Jinan University, they passed through Datong Road and Xinmin Road to the North Railway Station. The Japanese army had prepared a small room with cloth curtains on the platform in the station. A large map was placed on the table, and a Japanese officer explained the battle situation at the time. Lord Lytton asked in detail and believed that it seemed unnecessary to throw bombs at civilians who had no ability to resist. After an hour, they withdrew and passed through Jiefang Road and Baoshan Road to the Commercial Press. The walls of the steel and concrete buildings were still standing.</p>
<p>The investigation team went up to each floor of the Oriental Library for a brief look, expressing much regret.</p>
<p>Third Line: Starting from the Oriental Library, they passed through the end of North Sichuan Road, Tiantong'an Station, Qingyun Road, Tongji Road, Yokohama Road, Sanyang Road, West Baoxing Road, Liuying Road, Shuidao Road, and West Tiyuhui Road to Jiangwan Racecourse. The Japanese led the investigation team to the roof to explain the surrounding battle situation. They also visited Labor University and Jiangwan Station. There were currently four members of an American business group stationed in the racecourse. It was already 1:30 PM, so they went to Huangxing Road, Xiangyin Road, Ningguo Road, and Pingliang Road to the Gongda Yarn Factory, where the Japanese military headquarters was located. After the investigation team washed up, they first took a short rest in the guest room, and then General Shirakawa invited them downstairs for a cold meal. Shirakawa asked Lord Lytton if he still needed to go to Wusong. The Lord did not commit. Gu Weijun and Zhang Xianglin both said that Wusong was very important and must be visited. The Lord then made up his mind and left at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Fourth Line: Starting from the Gongda Yarn Factory, they went along Jungong Road to Wusong. Japanese soldiers came and went very frequently on Jungong Road. The entire area along the river was purely defensive ruins, and the houses in the town had been completely destroyed by bombing, as after a major earthquake, even more tragic than Zhabei. At 3:50, they found the battery. The battery foundation had been destroyed by our bombing, and many of the gun barrels had been damaged. Old guns had also been removed. They withdrew after an hour and went through Jungong Road, Pingliang Road, and Broadway Road back to the Cathay Hotel. It was already 5:30 PM. Because it was convenient to view, except for Major General McCoy, who had a slight illness and rode in a sedan, the others had no canopies. Because the wind and sand along the way were heavy, everyone looked like black people when they returned to Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Yesterday's Discussion on Ceasefire Principles <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Withdraws According to a Certain Procedure</p>
<p>Military Representatives to Attend the Morning Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai ceasefire and the issue of Japanese troop withdrawal, representatives from China, Japan, and related countries held their third meeting at the British Consulate General at 4:00 PM yesterday. Those present were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi, Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Aoi, British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, and Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano. Only French Minister Wilden was absent due to illness. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 PM. The outline of the ceasefire and troop withdrawal has been agreed upon. It was agreed that a formal meeting would be held tomorrow, Wednesday morning, with the participation of military representatives to decide on all the details. The basic principles agreed upon yesterday are as follows, according to the announcement of the meeting: 1. The Chinese army will temporarily remain in its current defense line. 2. The Japanese army will withdraw to its original defense line before January 28 according to a certain procedure. This procedure will be determined by a formal meeting. 3. A joint committee, including representatives from participating countries, will certify the implementation of the first and second items.</p>
<p>Both parties agreed to conduct a formal meeting on Wednesday morning, based on the above three basic principles, with the participation of military representatives. Our side will be represented by Jiang Guangnai, commander-in-chief of the 19th Route Army, and Chief of Staff Huang Qiang. The Japanese side will be represented by Ueda, commander of the 9th Division, Chief of Staff Tashiro, and Chief of Naval Staff Shimada. The most important issues in the ceasefire meeting, the date of the Japanese troop withdrawal and the withdrawal procedure, will be decided at this meeting. If progress is smooth and there are no unexpected changes, both parties are expected to formally sign the agreement after this meeting.</p>
<p>Instructions from the Nanjing and Tokyo governments regarding the results of Monday's meeting arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. After receiving the instructions, Vice Minister Guo immediately met with Chief of Staff Huang. Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Aoi also exchanged views with Chief of Staff Tashiro and held the meeting as scheduled. The atmosphere at the meeting was still good. The longest discussion was about the first item proposed by Vice Minister Guo regarding the "certain procedure" for the Japanese army to withdraw. After an hour of discussion, a decision was made. Shigemitsu Aoi also proposed that neutral troops be stationed in the area where the Japanese army withdrew, but the proposal was dropped because all parties believed it was unnecessary. After the meeting, British Minister Lampson invited the representatives to the British Consul General's residence for tea and conversation.</p>
<p>A Tokyo dispatch on the 21st stated that the diplomatic and military authorities consulted on the Shanghai case yesterday afternoon until late at night. They gathered again this morning to decide on the Japanese government's policy on the Shanghai temporary ceasefire plan as follows: 1. The withdrawal of the Japanese army from the current line of defense should not be monitored by foreign countries. The Japanese army can only withdraw to a line between Songhu. 2. The withdrawn area should be guarded by Chinese police together with Japanese police or international police. 3. The ceasefire is only a temporary plan. When the ceasefire negotiations end, a round table conference should be announced immediately to seek a lasting solution. 4. The withdrawal of the Japanese army is different from returning to Japan in order to avoid continuing hostile actions and facilitate peace negotiations. It must wait until lasting peace is guaranteed before it can be withdrawn to Japan.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Letter to Jiang Guangnai <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Uphold Justice During Negotiations. The Shanghai National Organizations' Association for Saving the Country, regarding the Shanghai Peace Conference, dispatched representatives Liu Liumin, Yin Ruli, Shen Junru, Zhang Zilian, Zheng Jie, and others to the rear office of the 19th Route Army at 8:00 AM yesterday to meet with Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai and make representations. Because they did not meet him, they sent the following letter: Respected Sir, the diplomacy of losing power and humiliating the country has been proceeding step by step in recent days. The glory and foundation of national establishment that all our people have obtained through the death-defying struggle of your army are in danger of being sacrificed. The people of Shanghai are extremely angry. Our association believes that the content of this negotiation, such as restricting the location of our army's defense, the Japanese army still being stationed in the pier and transportation location of the concession, and the establishment of a joint committee by China and Japan to monitor the withdrawal of troops with representatives of neutral countries, has in fact lost sovereignty in an invisible way. The conditions reported in Japanese newspapers, such as Japan building barracks in Wusong and China automatically easing anti-Japanese sentiment, would be tantamount to a treaty of submission if they were true. If the people still have a breath of life, they will never allow our nation to fall into eternal destruction. Your army is the army to which the people entrust their lives, and your commander-in-chief represents the entire army. If you participate in this negotiation, we urge you to uphold justice and ultimately reverse the decline. The representatives were commissioned by the conference and went to seek your guidance at 8:00 AM this morning but did not meet you. Therefore, we hereby send this letter, respectfully requesting your attention, so that the diplomatic authorities can preserve the vitality of the country and fight for this last life for the nation. We would be very grateful.</p>

<p>Correction of Liu Liumin's Remarks</p>
<p>According to a responsible person from the Shanghai branch of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, it was surprising to read the section in the Shanghai newspapers today regarding Liu Liumin's report at the board meeting of the National Organizations' Association for Saving the Country on his conversation with Deputy Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi. It was found that yesterday morning, Mr. Liu, along with Ding Jin, Zhou Xuechao, Wang Hanliang, Cao Yucai, and Shen Junru, went to Mr. Guo's residence. Mr. Guo received each of the representatives and explained in detail the general situation and nature of the two meetings held at the British Consulate the day before. He also solemnly stated that the discussion at the meeting was completely based on the resolutions of the League of Nations conference, with the scope of ceasefire and troop withdrawal. Any issues of a political nature were not included in the discussion. At that time, each of the representatives also expressed satisfaction. However, Mr. Liu's report (according to the newspaper) was inconsistent with the facts and clearly had a one-sided propaganda effect. At this critical moment in diplomacy, it is quite likely to cause misunderstandings on the part of the public, which would have a huge impact on the overall situation. Therefore, it is specially stated to clarify the truth.</p>

Many believe that this move is sufficient to indicate that Shanghai is no longer in danger of a crisis. The six destroyers will leave Manila on April 18 and return to the Mare Island Naval Base in California. The six submarines and the supply ship Pigeon will leave Manila on May 2 and return to Pearl Harbor on Oahu Island in the Hawaiian Islands. The transport ship Gamond will return to the United States first on March 30. (National Telegraph on the 20th)</p>

<p>The Japanese 24th Mixed Brigade, after receiving the order to withdraw from Fengtian, transported a batch of more than 2,000 people on the 19th. Those who had not yet departed were ordered to concentrate in Yangshupu by yesterday afternoon. Three transport ships, Baling Maru, Yamashiro Maru, and Shintani Maru (phonetic transcription), specially dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of the Army, were docked at the Huishan Osaka and other wharves. Soldiers boarded the ships one after another, totaling more than 3,000 people, and were only transported by evening. All military equipment had been loaded and transported to Japan on the 20th. After all the soldiers boarded the ship, they set sail from Wusong. It is said that they will first go to Moji and then to Kurume. The 11th Division is currently concentrating, and the first batch is planned to be loaded onto ships such as Chikuzen Maru and Tatsuta Yama Maru.</p>
<p>The Japanese fleet moving westward. Since the outbreak of the war, 47 Japanese warships have come to Shanghai, and the 1st Foreign Squadron originally stationed in the Yangtze River also had 15 ships, totaling more than 60 ships. After the battle line moved westward, the Japanese Navy turned its attention to the Yangtze River. In the past two weeks, the Japanese Navy used six riverboats to transport large quantities of military equipment, guns, and ammunition to Hankou and other ports, and then carried several batches of naval marines to Hankou. The day before yesterday, it even sent two squadrons of torpedo boats stationed in Shanghai, totaling eight ships, to the Yangtze River. Rear Admiral Shiozawa, commander of the 1st Foreign Navy, even took the flagship Ataka upstream to the west, heading to Hankou. The large Japanese fleet moving westward every day has concentrated its forces in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which is enough to arouse special attention from our people. At present, there are at least 37 or 38 Japanese ships stationed at various ports on the Yangtze River, and the traffic of transport ships is even denser.</p>
<p>Members of the Southeast Self-Defense Army</p>
<h3 id="e9">Jiang Mingji Arrested <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Important Documents in Chinese and Japanese Found</p>
<p>Including a Letter from Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Aoi</p>
<p>And Bank Savings Books with 900 Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Jiang Mingji Still Tried to Deny It</p>
<p>It was previously reported that Li Mingzhong and others, who organized the Southeast Self-Defense Army at the Datong Hotel on Nanjing Road in the Public Concession, were apprehended with the assistance of the police and transferred to the Second High Court for judgment and then to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Now, it is learned that as a result of the investigation by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, they confessed to another member, Jiang Mingji, who was hiding in the Jing'an Temple area. Therefore, they began to investigate and confirm his address. It was then discovered that Jiang Mingji was from Sichuan and was currently residing at 744 Ziweli, Seymour Road, in the mansion of Zhang Zhijiang's younger brother, Jiangsu Pacification Supervisor. Based on this information, the Wen Public Security Bureau sent a letter to the First Special District Local Court requesting the issuance of an arrest warrant and a search warrant. Pan Lianbi, a Chinese detective from the political department of the General Patrol Room, and Crowe, a Western detective from the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room, assisted Qi Haitao, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and went to Zhang's mansion at noon on the 19th to arrest Jiang Mingji. Many important Chinese and Japanese documents and a bank savings book with 945 silver dollars were found in Jiang's bedroom and taken to the patrol room. The patrol chief reviewed the documents one by one and realized their extraordinary importance. They were numbered and sent to the First Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Feng Shide opened a court session for interrogation. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer representing the Public Works Department, explained the case and presented all the evidence, stating that the content of the evidence was very clear. Therefore, the patrol room did not object to the Public Security Bureau's request for transfer. Judge Feng then questioned the defendant Jiang Mingji, who stated that he was a representative of the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army of Gansu and was sent to Shanghai to purchase items. The documents presented as evidence all had sources. He had previously studied in Japan and knew many Japanese people, so there was correspondence between them. However, his purpose was to oppose Japan's current policy. The patrol room lawyer then presented Exhibit 2 and asked the court to question it. The exhibit was a letter from Japanese Minister to China Shigemitsu Aoi to the defendant. The defendant claimed that he also had a friendly relationship with Shigemitsu, and had written to Shigemitsu in a private capacity to inquire about the Japanese events in China. Shigemitsu replied in this letter. This was purely private correspondence and had nothing to do with the overall situation. The patrol room lawyer then inquired about the meaning of the phrase "5,000 rifles in Shandong and Jiangsu" in another letter. The defendant claimed that these rifles were used for suppressing bandits and self-defense. The patrol room lawyer then presented another letter with the phrases "implementing the plan, internal defection" and the names of Feng, Yu, Jiang, Wang, Lin, Wang Yanbin of Shanghai, Fu Xiaoan, Wang Yiting, and other unintelligible words. The defendant then claimed that this paper was picked up by a waiter when he was staying at a hotel and used to wrap his belongings. He asked for it as waste paper. The defendant's lawyer, Fan Gang, defended him, saying that the Public Security Bureau's request for transfer did not provide concrete evidence, and even the person who confessed the defendant had not been brought to the court to testify. Moreover, a formal transfer document had not been submitted. Therefore, his lawyer should object to the transfer. Qi Haitao, a detective from the Public Security Bureau, stated that the reason for not having the document was due to the limited time. Judge Feng then instructed Jiang Mingji to be temporarily detained in the patrol room and wait for a formal document from the Public Security Bureau before further interrogation. At that time, the defendant made two requests: 1. He is currently ill and asked the court to order the patrol room to treat him favorably in the detention center. 2. He is a scholar. Before this case is decided, when the court brings him back to the patrol room, please order the escorts to remove the shackles to maintain his dignity. Judge Feng temporarily granted the requests and adjourned the court.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Statement Regarding the Arrest of Wang Geng <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Mao Shengdong, a committee member of the 88th Division's party headquarters, came to Shanghai from Suzhou yesterday on behalf of Yu Jishi, the commander of the division, to visit the wounded soldiers and expressed his opinion on the arrest of Wang Geng, the independent brigade commander of the division. The statement is recorded below: Our division participated in the War of Resistance. After the Japanese army in Shanghai issued an ultimatum to the 19th Route Army, we deployed defenses between Jiangwan and Miaohang. At 9:00 AM on February 20, the Japanese army launched an attack on our division's line with approximately half of its forces in Shanghai, totaling about 50,000 troops. We fought fiercely, killing countless enemies. Our division's officers and soldiers also sacrificed greatly. The fierce battle continued until March 1. Because the Japanese army landed in Liuhe, threatening the left flank of our army, our army was ordered to safely retreat along the entire line. As for the report that independent brigade commander Wang Geng was pursued by the Japanese army in the concession, there are many misunderstandings. Wang Geng was originally the chief of the customs police regiment. After Song Ziwen resigned from his position as Minister of Finance, he was temporarily under the control of our division commander. After Song resumed his position, he was ordered to return to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. This time, the brigade's participation in the War of Resistance was not under the command of our division commander. As for the Osaka newspaper reporter's interview with Wang Geng, stating that Wang Geng admitted that he was the brigade commander of the 88th Division and was not willing to resist Japan under orders, but was coerced by a few Guangdong factions, it is thought that this is a deliberate provocation by the Japanese. If Wang Geng really made this statement, it is strange. In short, our army's resistance to Japan is the only way for the Chinese nation to survive. It is not a local issue, nor is it a matter of personal will. I hope that the people of the country will understand this.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Unstable Japanese Political Situation <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Adventurous Actions in China</p>
<p>The Mainland News Agency's New York dispatch on the 19th reported that today's New York Times commentary believes that the current instability in the Japanese political situation is due to the results of military adventurism in China. The instability in the Tokyo political situation is due to the increasing number of Japanese people who believe that the results obtained in the mainland of China and Northeast China are illusory and useless. The adventure in Shanghai has been seriously opposed by responsible people in Tokyo from beginning to end. It is also said that the suspicion of neutral countries towards Japan is increasing, and no one agrees that it will succeed. Therefore, the Japanese have not received any support in Geneva, and their situation in the international community has become isolated.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Welcoming Banquet for the League of Nations Investigation Commission <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>General Labor Union's Welcome</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, a member of the Central Committee, hosted a banquet at his residence on West Aihams Road at 8 PM yesterday in honor of the League of Nations Investigation Commission and its Secretary-General. All members were present except for the Italian representative who was absent due to illness. Those in attendance included Gu Weijun and his wife, Wu Tiecheng and his wife, Guo Taiqi and his wife, and Ms. Zheng Yuxiu, totaling twenty people. The wife of the Secretary-General of the Investigation Commission also attended, and she was hosted by Madam Song Ailing, the wife of Kong Xiangxi. The meal was Chinese cuisine served in a Western style. The conversation during the banquet was lively, and the gathering concluded happily around 11 PM.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union sent a letter to the League of Nations Investigation Commission, which read: "Respected Commissioners, we are pleased to learn that your esteemed Investigation Commission has arrived here on a mission to investigate the truth of the Sino-Japanese Incident. Our General Labor Union sincerely represents the 800,000 workers of Shanghai in extending our warmest welcome and deepest respect. Since Japan unlawfully seized Liaoning on September 18th of last year, thus destroying China's territorial integrity, more than half a year has passed. Our people have endured humiliation and pain, wholeheartedly trusting the international community and hoping for a peaceful resolution. Your esteemed Commission's arrival not only deepens our understanding of the effectiveness of trusting the League of Nations but also demonstrates that international justice remains brightly illuminated. We deeply believe that your Commission's task lies in investigating the facts. We, therefore, submit a clear account of the factual events for your consideration and report to the League of Nations, so that world peace and international justice, under the League of Nations' leadership, can ensure the preservation of our complete territory. (1) Occupation of Liaoning: Japan seized Liaoning under the pretext that the South Manchurian Railway was suddenly cut by Chinese people on September 18th. However, the South Manchurian Railway area has always been protected by Japanese troops, and Chinese civilians are not allowed to step near the tracks. The facts are clear, and we believe your Commissioners are aware of this. The contrived excuses are not worth refuting. Japan habitually uses deceptive rhetoric to confuse the world. We trust that your Commissioners, with clear vision, will not be deceived. (2) Occupation of Jinzhou: Despite repeated statements accepting the League of Nations' resolutions of November 20th and December 10th, the Japanese still forcibly seized Jinzhou. Can such actions be said to be without territorial ambitions? Can it be said that the statements of acceptance of the League of Nations' resolutions by this so-called civilized nation have any credibility? (3) Military Action in Shanghai: At midnight on January 28th, under the command of Commander Shiozawa, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces launched an attack on Zhabei eight hours after the Japanese Consul-General expressed satisfaction with the Shanghai Mayor's reply. After our army's self-defense and resistance, the battle lasted for more than a month. The Japanese army repeatedly used aircraft, artillery, and naval infantry to attack our forces. Our army followed orders from superiors, and aside from making all efforts to maintain local order and protect the lives of people of all nationalities, we have absolutely not taken any other excessive actions. However, the Japanese soldiers made every effort to burn and bomb all cultural institutions, charitable organizations, shops, and residences, with few surviving. Statistical losses have already exceeded 400 million, and casualties exceed 8,000. Currently, the Chinese army has retreated beyond the 20-kilometer distance requested by Japan in the ceasefire conditions, but the Japanese soldiers continue to advance. This kind of action can only be described as war, and it is necessary to stop it immediately. Now that your Commission has arrived, a ray of hope has emerged for world peace. In this regard, your Commission should recognize that our army has consistently limited itself to self-defense, and those who should withdraw are the Japanese troops who have forcibly occupied various areas.</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Without a sincere intention to withdraw troops, empty talk of peace will be ineffective. We have long hoped for peace and have long looked to the League of Nations for justice. We firmly believe that peace and justice will ultimately prevail, and we further believe that through your Commission's good offices, this will endure."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu</p>
<h3 id="e15">Mayor Wu's Address to Public Security Bureau Personnel <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Public Security Bureau's anniversary celebration, Mayor Wu addressed the entire bureau staff, saying, "My colleagues, I had only just taken office when the January 28th Incident occurred, and Shanghai fell into a state of war. Fortunately, our 19th Route Army and 5th Army fought bravely for more than a month. But while the front lines were fighting externally, we also had to rely on the police in the rear to maintain local order. If order in the rear is not peaceful, the troops in the front lines will not be able to focus on fighting externally. Therefore, soldiers fighting externally are loyal to the country and loyal to their military duties, and the police maintaining local order are also loyal to the country and loyal to their police duties. I spent four or five years handling police affairs in Guangzhou, and there were repeated wars every year, so I know deeply that maintaining order in the rear is the most important responsibility. This responsibility is most valuable when it can eliminate trouble before it arises, uncovering various conspiracies before danger occurs, and preserving local order and the people's peace. This is the greatest effectiveness of the police. Last Saturday, Captain Huang of the Public Security Bureau's Police Brigade and Company Commanders Jiang and Sheng and others cracked the Southeast Self-Defense Army case, uncovering a conspiracy to endanger the government and disrupt the local area before the riot occurred, and quickly apprehended the key criminals, preserving local order and peace. This is the best demonstration of the greatest effectiveness of the police, and a good example of eliminating trouble before it arises. The Executive Yuan has already sent a telegram to commend this. But we must know that those traitors will definitely not stop after one case is cracked, so we who serve in the police should pay attention at all times, in all places, and in all matters. No matter when, no matter where, and no matter how big or small the matter, we should pay close attention in order to eliminate trouble before it arises, so as to demonstrate the highest effectiveness of the police, to maintain permanent peace and order, and to shoulder the heavy responsibility of maintaining the rear and defending the country. The effectiveness of previous work has already been demonstrated and commended. Future work should be even more diligent, maintaining permanent honor. I have high expectations."</p>

<p>Active Trading in the Industry</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was strong and profitable, with prices rising frequently. Trading among firms was particularly active. Although views differed, the market trended upward. Prices advanced sharply and retreated slowly, with a difference of nine taels in half a day. The silver market reported a decline, and exchange rates for both domestic and foreign transactions were tight. Chinese merchants were constantly scrambling. As a result, the price of gold opened high and quickly exceeded 680 taels. Buyers were active, and the market became more vigorous, continuing to rise by six or seven taels. The market remained in a state of pause thereafter. The opening price rose by 3.5 mace to 681.5 taels. Large silver bars were stable for the near term, but the far term decreased slightly by 1/16.

<p>Having Declined but Unable to Obtain Permission</p>
<p>Only Quietly Awaiting Opportunity</p>
<p>(Jinan) Wang Jingwei's reply to Han's telegram: To Chairman Han Xiangfang brother, with respectful admiration. I have received and read your telegram, admiring your humble sincerity. The Second Plenary Session decided that active military personnel should not concurrently hold administrative positions. This regulation should be implemented gradually within the shortest possible period to establish the principle of separation of military and civilian administration. However, there remains room to assess the situation, weigh the urgency, and consider the pace of implementation. Currently, the enemy's presence is pressing, and Shandong's territory is strategically important. We rely on your talent to manage and coordinate the overall situation. Please actively take responsibility and do not be passive. After the crisis has passed, we can calmly discuss. Please take on the difficult and important tasks, and entrust the lighter and easier tasks to other comrades to share the responsibility. This way, responsibility and humility can be properly balanced. I believe your wisdom will agree with this. I offer my sincere reply and ask for your consideration. Your brother, Wang Zhaoming, Xiaoyin. Han's reply to Wang's telegram: To President Wang Jun of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, respectfully replying to your previous telegram. I am deeply grateful for your warm words of comfort and encouragement, and I am moved. My position belongs to the military, and I have always taken obedience to orders as my duty. Now that the nation is in difficulty, I dare not insist on relinquishing my responsibilities at this time of crisis and survival. However, Shandong connects the north and south, and is located at the strategic point of the Yellow and Bohai Seas. The situation is extremely serious. I consider myself to be of insufficient talent to shoulder such a heavy burden, and I fear that I will delay the region and mislead the nation. Therefore, I telegraphed to resign from all my concurrent positions and recommend a worthy successor. It has always been my ambition to lead troops to garrison the border and engage in land reclamation in the Northwest to strengthen border defenses. Now that I have declined but have not been granted permission, I can only quietly await the opportunity. If someone can take over, I hope to fulfill my long-cherished wish and repay the nation in the future. I am endlessly grateful for the kindness I have received. I respectfully offer this reply.

It was only a few minutes before the Prime Minister passed by on his way home after attending a banquet for the diplomatic corps. The damage was minimal. The mastermind has not yet been found. Official circles believe that this action is merely a demonstration of yesterday's severe sentencing of 17 political prisoners, and its purpose is not to assassinate the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Based on Preliminary Statistics from Various Agencies' Reports</p>
<p>The losses of official property due to the Northeast Incident are enormous. Wu Dajun, Director of the Statistics Office of the Central Party Headquarters and Acting Director of the National Government's Bureau of Statistics, has recently compiled extremely detailed reports from Northeast Chinese officials and compiled a complete set of statistics, excerpts of which are provided below.

<p>Offers Jiandao and Hunchun as Collateral</p>
<p>Dalian Dispatch: Since the establishment of the Manchurian puppet state, it has held two puppet cabinet meetings, the first on the 10th and the second on the 12th. Those present included the puppet Premier Zheng Xiaoxu, the puppet Minister of Civil Affairs Zang Shiyi, the puppet Minister of Foreign Affairs Xie Jieshi, the puppet Minister of Finance Xi Qia, the puppet Minister of Industry Zhang Yanqing, the puppet Minister of Justice Feng Hanqing, and the puppet senators Yuan Jinkai, Luo Zhenyu, Sun Qichang, and Gui Fu, among others, more than ten people, examined and deliberated on the items of the puppet state's military and administrative expenses. According to the report of the puppet Minister of Finance Xi Qia, the new country's budget requires 80 million yuan per year. Currently, due to the founding of the country, income and expenditure are insufficient for distribution. It is proposed to borrow 20 million yuan from Japan. The cabinet members agreed and unanimously approved it, and it was presented to the puppet Chief Executive Puyi for approval. It is said that the Japanese government will agree to this loan, but it requires that the Jiandao and Hunchun areas on the border of Jilin be incorporated into the new Japanese special administrative region as a condition. The puppet state has generally acquiesced to this, but it is kept secret from the outside world. Jiandao is our country's Yanji border area, located between the borders of China and Korea. The Japanese have coveted it for a long time, so they call it Jiandao. There are 400,000 Koreans residing in the area, while the number of Chinese is less than three-tenths of the number of Koreans. In recent years, the Japanese have established police forces in the area, seized our country's police power, and strongly claimed that the area is Korean territory. Our Northeast authorities have never interfered. Chinese who go to Jiandao still have to pass through Korean territory. The number of Korean people who have migrated to Hunchun, which also belongs to Jilin, in recent years has exceeded three times the number of Chinese. Both places are actually part of our country's territory. The Japanese are now taking the opportunity to seize them by establishing a puppet state. We hope that our government and people will pay close attention, (March 17th)</p>

<p>About One Hundred and Fifty Groups</p>
<p>Members Reach Five Hundred Thousand People</p>
<p>Seven Articles of the Vanguard Declaration</p>
<p>Tokyo Hochi Shimbun's Tokyo Dispatch reports: After the origin of the pistols was revealed from the mouths of Kurosawa and Konai, the key figures in the Blood Pledge Corps, the Metropolitan Police Department investigated Tanaka, a student at Tokyo University, and Tagura, a student at Kyoto University. It was found that Tagura was a member of the Yūkyōkai, a right-leaning thought research group within Kyoto University, and belonged to Katsuei-kan with members such as Sato Mitsuhiro, Mori Kenji, and Nagao Kōri. These comrades jointly saw off the soldiers passing through Kyoto Station last month when they left for the front. Currently, Mori and Sato have escaped, except for Nagao, who has been arrested by the Kamo Police Station. Recently, the landlady of Katsuei-kan confessed that she saw about fourteen or fifteen people gathering and talking in Tagura's room every night, including university professors and military personnel.</p>
<p>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reports: The Metropolitan Police Department believes that Tanaka and Tagura, from the Blood Pledge Assassination Corps, which plotted to assassinate political leaders and financial tycoons, are definitely significantly related to the assassination of Finance Minister Inoue. Now, they have confessed the following division of assassination tasks: 1. Onuma Tadashi was in charge of assassinating Finance Minister Inoue; 2. Hishiji was in charge of assassinating Tuan Nan; 3. Tagura was in charge of assassinating former Prime Minister Wakatsuki; 4. Tanaka was in charge of assassinating Tokonami Takejirō. Each was equipped with a pistol, under the overall command of Konai. Recently, the Metropolitan Police Department's official residence section, regarding the recently popular groups, apart from those related to political indoctrination, has found that there are more than one hundred and fifty groups in the Tokyo area alone, with members scattered throughout the country reaching five hundred thousand people. It has already ordered a secret investigation into the members' movements and their relationship with the headquarters, while also investigating the activities of extreme leftists.</p>
<p>Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun reports: After Tagura was arrested, several copies of "An Unofficial History of the Chinese Revolution" were found in his room. It is said that Tagura used to bury himself in studying it with his classmates. Furthermore, according to the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo, the Metropolitan Police Department has been searching for a great deal of evidence of the assassination corps for days. Among them, the Assassination Blood Pledge Death Squad, with Inoue Nisshō as its leader, and the Nisshō Vanguard Corps, with Kano Toshi as its leader and Ijichi Yoshikazu as its deputy leader, are most noteworthy. On the 14th late at night, Police Inspector Shimizu found a volume of the Vanguard Corps' blood oath declaration in Kano's house, with nineteen names signed. The oath declaration has seven articles:</p>
<p>The translated text of the oath declaration is as follows: 1. Establish ambitions with righteousness and act with integrity, strictly abiding by faith as firm as metal; 2. Trust each other with spirit, not placing minor differences in your heart. Internally, treat each other with respect and love; externally, carry out great justice with a single bullet; 3. Further clarify the chivalrous spirit, and for the sake of impoverished compatriots, challenge the country-destroying classes; 4. Share joys and sorrows with the nation in mind, and all actions should be consistently filled with patriotic sincerity; 5. Obey the overall strategy of the entire army and advance bravely, without retreating; 6. Understand the great trends of the world, be clear about internal and external currents of thought, do not miss great opportunities, and possess the knowledge and true courage to handle major events with prudence; 7. Leave life and death to fate, and do not reveal secrets rashly.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Organize Theft Rings <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Report: Recently, theft cases have been occurring frequently in various places in Asahikawa City. After a thorough investigation, the criminals caught are all elementary school students aged between twelve and fourteen. The school authorities were shocked to hear this and began investigating the conduct of students in all schools throughout the city. They discovered that there were theft ring organizations of ten to thirty students in each school. These children, seeing their friends committing theft, were also tempted by it and influenced by the trend of theft. Moreover, according to the confessions of the arrested students, they were actually forced to resort to this due to poverty. Even most of the parents of the theft students were pleased with what they did, which is a significant problem in education. Furthermore, according to a phone report from the Takasaki branch, five students from the second grade of the advanced course at Takasaki City Central Elementary School, namely Arai Go, age sixteen, Kimura Shizuo, age sixteen, Shimizu Daitaro, age fifteen, Eguchi Hosokichi, age sixteen, and Ono Hoshizo, age fifteen, have been organizing theft parties of three since the end of last year. They specialize in going to bookstores, magazine stores, stationery stores, and the Joshin Electric Railway depot within the city to steal money, books, and miscellaneous items. It has now been discovered and they have all been reported to the Takasaki Police Station.</p>

<p>Our Country's Special Envoy for Awarding Medals is Zhang Ming</p>
<p>Nepal is an independent kingdom in Asia, located between China and India. The country's Prime Minister and Grand Marshal is a hereditary position. During the Qing Dynasty, our country once conferred the title of "Brave King Commander of Troops" on the country's Prime Minister. The National Government, considering that the country's Prime Minister, Bin-kun, is friendly to our nation, decided last year to grant him the title of Army General and award him the First Class Baoding Medal as a token of goodwill. It specially appointed the recorded minister Zhang Ming as a special envoy to Nepal. On February 8, the country's government formally held a ceremony to receive the General and the medal. On that day, it specially dispatched a royal four-horse carriage to the temporary palace to welcome Special Envoy Zhang into the palace. Tens of thousands of soldiers and police saluted along the way, and more than one hundred thousand people watched. When entering the palace, Chinese music was specially played and a twenty-one-gun salute was fired. After Ambassador Zhang pinned the medal on the Prime Minister and Grand Marshal, he delivered a speech. The Prime Minister delivered a thank-you speech. After the ceremony, he shook hands with Ambassador Zhang and his wife to bid farewell. In addition to the country's senior civil and military officials, foreign guests and ambassadors from various countries, along with their wives, were present at the ceremony.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Qiongya Changes to Special District <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Wu Chaoshu Agrees to Serve as Administrative Officer</p>
<p>But Proposes Four Management Methods</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Qiongya has always been known as one of the four lower prefectures. However, Qiong Island is isolated in Hainan. Due to its natural shape, it is isolated from the mainland, so the island's industry has not been fully developed. In order to develop the area, the authorities decided in December last year at a temporary meeting of the Guangzhou National Government to change Qiongya to a special administrative region and appointed Wu Chaoshu as the Chief Executive of the Qiongya Special Administrative Region. After the political upheaval, Wu did not take office. Yesterday, Wu was slightly free from official duties, and the authorities again strongly urged him to take office. He finally agreed to take office. However, before taking office, he requested the government to grant the following four matters: 1. Change the previously designated Qiongya Special Administrative Region to the Qiongya Special District; 2. In addition to the original thirteen counties of Qiongya, the scope of the special district should include the Dongsha and Xisha Islands and nearby islands due to natural geographical relations; 3. In accordance with the proposals of Hu Hanmin, Tang Shaoyi, and Sun Ke to change Qiongya to a special district, the reason is that it is relatively less susceptible to military influence and can serve as a testing ground for the Three People's Principles. Select loyal comrades in the party, grant them full authority, and give them a period of twenty-five years to implement the Three People's Principles, which is a profound intention. Only in this way will wealthy overseas Chinese be willing to invest and develop industries. As for local security, a local security team will be formed to maintain it. If the currently stationed marine corps is withdrawn, it will still be able to request the central government or consult neighboring chief executives to send naval, land, and air forces to protect it in the event of foreign aggression in the future; 4. Qiongya is a poor area. During this national crisis, we dare not ask the central government for financial assistance. However, by changing it to a special district, all national, provincial, and local taxes within the region, as well as various public bonds and treasury bonds temporarily raised, should be collected by the Guangdong Provincial Government and the National Tax Administration from March 1 of this year. Stop collecting and manage by the Qiongya Special District Government. The money and grain taxes and all bonds raised by the Guangdong Provincial Government or the competent authorities in Qiongya before March 1 shall still be borne by the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Guangdong National Tax Administration. All administrative, educational, judicial, party affairs, and security expenses in the Special District, except for national defense military expenses, shall be borne by the Qiongya Special District Government. However, the outstanding expenses before March 1 shall be cleared by the Guangdong Provincial Government and the original paying agencies to clarify the boundaries. Wu Chaoshu presented the above four items to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee for review. The committee submitted it to the seventh meeting, which was approved and presented to the Luoyang National Government for review. (March 15)</p>
