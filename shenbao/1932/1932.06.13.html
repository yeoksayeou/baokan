<h3>救濟戰區敎育</h3>
<p>彬</p>
<p>此次抗日血戰。上海吳淞寳山嘉定太倉各戰區。受災至爲慘重。吾人今日但一往閘北戰區視察。可見昔日之繁華市塲。今僅乘斷垣碎瓦。凄然偃地。火焚之遺跡。炮彈之遺痕。皆宛然猶新。就閘北之慘况。推而至於其他各戰區當焚之遺跡。炮彈之遺痕。皆宛然猶新。就閘北之慘况。推而至於其他各戰區。當無不皆然。今戰事旣停。日軍且已漸撤。如何以救濟此受災慘重之戰區。如何以安撫此流離無所依附之災。民如何以復興戰區之工商百業。是即爲當前之一絶大問題。</p>
<p>爲解决此一絶大問題。邇近已有上海市戰區善後籌委會蘇省戰區濟委員會等籌謀戰區善後之組織。而參與此種組織者。又大都爲各界之俊彦。歷次會議。如救濟戰區農民問題。救濟平民經濟。皆有詳細之討吾人蓋可預測其將來。必獲得良好之效果不過吾人尙有須特别提出貢獻於善後委員會諸君子者。即戰區敎育之復興。尤應鄭重注意是。</p>
<p>救濟戰區敎育必須特别着重之理由。蓋以萬千靑年爲此戰事。荒蕪其學業。且或因而根本失去其求學之機會。其影響於此萬千靑年將來之生活。以及社會文化無形損失之鉅。斷不在有形之工商業以及農業之下。工商業農業之救濟。固極重要。敎育之救濟不更爲當前之急務耶。</p>
<p>吾人認爲救濟戰區敎育。首先必須多選敎育專家爲善後委員俾能作周詳之救濟。及進一步之改進計劃。次之。戰區之學校。皆應極力興。絶不應以經濟之困難或其他原因就此停閉。如目前勞動大學之停辦。吾人實未敢贊同。復次戰區敎育之救濟。應特别注重中學與小學。中小學生多係戰區本地之子弟。學校停頓。其學業遂完全荒廢。而由於戰禍之茶毒家庭因而破産無力繼續入學者。爲數當亦極多故救濟之道應酌量情形。復興原有之學校并補助無力入學之子弟。免其一切費用。此爲國家應負之責任斷不容視爲難舉置而不爲也。</p>
<p>總之。復興戰區。决不容緩。日本曩昔東京地震。受災至重。而彼集全力以與。自然搏戰。不數年竟告興復。我國今日如無以復興此爲强鄰兵器所摧毁縱横百里之戰區。斯誠爲大恥。生聚敎訓。吾人當以此發其端。</p>
<p>此外吾人認爲此次之抗日血戰。意義至爲重大。而此次戰區備受茶毒之慘。狀身歷目撃。當足以予吾人以極深刻之印象。激起吾民族發憤自雄之精神。故吾人希望上海左近之學校。多領導學生前往視察。予以最親近事實之剌激。吾人更建議在戰區永留一砲毁之地。保存其受災之原狀以永誌此次抗日血戰之英武精神。并使國人永永得以觸目警心</p>

<h3>英法總揆交換意見</h3>
<p>麥唐納偕西門抵巴黎</p>
<p>兩國代表會於法外部</p>
<p>就洛桑會議有所談商</p>
<p>公報稱雙方意見吻合</p>
<p>巴黎十一日路透社電　英相麥唐納偕外相西門今日行抵巴黎、法總理赫禮歐親在車站月臺歡迎、談話甚歡、麥氏操英語曰、今重與君晤、不勝欣慰、赫氏操法語曰、余亦然也、兩總揆挾臂步出月臺後、麥乃與其女公子驅赴英大使署、當時車站内外觀者極盛、當兩總揆過時、皆大呼赫禮歐萬歲、麥唐納萬歲、赫氏定明日欵宴麥氏、但地點仍秘而不宣、赫氏今晨與洛桑會議法代表團討論一切、繼乃接見美代使蘇大使日大使、</p>
<h3>赫禮歐到車站歡迎</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社十一日巴黎電　英首相本日抵此、下午五時加萊快車、未到北站之前、外交界人物、已紛集站台、警察分配職務、電影公司、安置鏡箱、準備攝影、由巴黎四郊乘車進城之客、均改由他道出站、公共工程部長達拉等耶、於五時十五分到站、赫禮歐著常禮服、戴大禮帽、跟跡而至、五時四十分、快車進站、停於迎接人員站立地點稍遠之處、麥克唐納、在第二輛車中、新聞記者、蜂擁而上、其時麥氏已立於車門外、著灰色大呢運動衣、戴軟帽、並帶眼鏡、赫禮歐攘臂急馳而前、以英語與之寒暄、麥唐納、一笑相迎、謂自財政會議之後、久未晤面、此次重逢、欣慰無似、麥氏隨命其女公子伊撒白爾、出與赫禮歐爲禮、旋即相率步出車站、沿途新聞記者、及電影公司、爭燃鎂光、攝取影片、至車站門前、麥氏及女公子並赫禮歐、共乘一車、西門外相、則與英大使同車而去、離站時、民衆歡呼、甚爲熱烈云、</p>
<h3>兩總揆同車赴外部</h3>
<p>國民社十一日巴黎電　英首相麥唐納、及外相西門、今夕自倫敦安抵法京、法新總理赫禮歐及其他閣員數人均到站歡迎、法人之在站歡迎者甚衆、麥氏等下車後、即與赫禮歐氏同車馳赴法外部、在外部舉行談話會甚久、至夜八時、由赫禮歐作東晚餐、今日所討論事項、不外不日開幕之洛桑會議、諒明日尙須繼續討論、并聞麥唐納等已定星期一日離法赴日内瓦</p>
<h3>談話會發表公報</h3>
<p>路透社十二日巴黎電　英法兩總揆及英相法財長今晨十時起會晤聚談至下午一時三十分始已、嗣發表公報如下、友好的非正式談話表示雙方意見之吻合可卜洛桑會議能獲公正與有效的解决、而因以掌固國際和平之信任與維持云、今日聚談之久長、及公報語調之樂觀、足徵在賠欵會議舉行之前、擬透澈研究各問題、期望能獲實際的效果、</p>
<h3>赫禮歐謂有滿意結果</h3>
<p>哈瓦社十二日巴黎電　英法兩國當軸會晤後、赫禮歐雖不願發表任何政治宣言、但稱磋商結果、甚爲滿意云、</p>
<h3>法内閣討論談話要點</h3>
<p>路透社十一日倫敦電　法内閣昨日集議、已討論赫禮歐在英法談話中所須提出之要點、據英報巴黎訪電、赫禮歐曾聲明英法目前立塲、彼此無大差異云、</p>
<h3>英相等寓英使署</h3>
<p>英相等在巴黎時將住於英使署、何時赴瑞士、尙未切實决定、預料下星期初、將先往日内瓦、然後赴洛桑、其餘英代表如薩繆爾張伯倫任錫曼等、定星期二日由倫敦起程、參與星期四日開幕之洛桑會議、</p>
<h3>美國不欲參加洛會</h3>
<p>泰晤士報稱、美政府現不欲參加洛桑會議、其理由雖令人失望、然已無可挽回、</p>
<h3>取銷債務合法計畫</h3>
<p>英法政府在明日巴黎集議時最緊要之事件、厥爲彼此獲取可取銷歐洲政府債務之合法計畫、此種債務、目前並未照付、今英法若採愈大之目光、則此事愈有解决景象、雖完全立即之取銷、在實施上或屬不可行、而在許多人視之、亦爲道德上與商業上所不許、但英國人士殆未有　欲德國再以債欵償還英國者、故英相當可處於設然進行之地位、以促成將來終必取銷債務之手續云、</p>
<h3>英報推測洛會前途</h3>
<p>路透社十二日倫敦電　今日各英報皆極注意關於洛桑會議之消息、咸以爲洛桑會議之希望、在暗淡多時之後、今忽明朗、蓋以法國終可接受英國所主張、如美國所予讓步可與歐洲讓步相抵、則完全取消賠欵與戰債之政策也、</p>
<h3>英相擬調和美法見解</h3>
<p>聞英相擬調和美法見解、將提議再停付賠欵與戰債半年、而由德國將其鐵路股票交與債權人、以作其賠欵與債務之最後清理、衆料德國新政府爲切實解决起見、或不得不俯就範圍、惟法政府之地位、聞頗危險、因財政馬丁與度支部長巴爾瑪德已聲明、如政府不採行其程序、則彼等將辭職也、其所擬程序、有積極裁減公費、薪俸亦一律滅落一條、民政人員對此、現皆反對、</p>
<h3>意總代表改派格蘭第</h3>
<p>路透社十一日羅馬電　意政府原擬派財相摩斯柯尼爲意國總代表、參加洛桑會議、今日意内閣怱有出人意外之决定、改派外相格蘭第爲意代表團領袖、此爲英相麥唐納擬擴大洛桑賠欵會議範圍之結果、英相與意外相將星期一日集議、互相比較英意兩國程序間之同意點、</p>
<p>賠欵難題</p>
<h3>待决於洛桑會議</h3>
<p>德國决意聲言所付賠欵已盡量</p>
<p>已繳賠欵總數三方面估計懸殊暫停付欵問題將爲爭論之焦點</p>
<p>國民社十一日巴黎電　歐戰休戰以來、業已十三年半、德國今乃决意謂其所付賠欵業已足夠、法比兩國則猶堅持、國人所償猶未足額其他舊協約國、則以半同情之態度、擁護法比之說、此兩種相反主張、行將於本月十六日開幕之洛桑會議、加以判决、</p>
<h3>九國皆爲債權國</h3>
<p>此次集議洛桑者十國、其中法英意比南羅葡日希九國、皆爲債權國、德人獨爲債務國、猶法庭上之被告、美國雖不正式參加、但爲各國自德所得賠欵之大部份承受者、當然亦加以密切注意、今法人力主自歐戰以來、其所費於補償損失之費共一千七百五十五萬萬佛郎、連利息併計、照目前法佛價值、共約二千五百萬萬佛郎、但德國所繳賠欵之數、倘德人之計算不誤、則已近五千萬萬佛郎、而其中百分之五十四入於法國、</p>
<h3>已繳賠欵總數</h3>
<p>惟已繳賠欵總數、德國政府與舊協約國政府、及美國經濟學會三方面調查結果、竟大相逕庭、其自道威斯計劃以後、所繳數目、有賬可稽、當然無甚出入、惟自休戰日起、至一九二四年道威斯計劃實行時止、其間所繳、則計算大異、據協約國正式公認者、自休戰日起、至一九二二年止、約八十萬萬馬克、此即協約國賠欵委員會發表之數、但德國所計算者、竟達五百六十萬萬馬克、美國經濟學會估連者、</p>
<p>幾達二百六十萬萬馬克、自一九二二年以後、在佔領魯爾區域期内、法國曾承認向德人取德十七萬五千萬馬克、德國則力爭尙遠逾此數、此以德國已繳賠欵總額、迄於胡佛停止計劃時止、</p>
<h3>三種大相懸殊之計數</h3>
<p>現有三種大相懸殊之計數、（一）德人方面四一二·○八九百萬佛郎、（二）美人方面二三一·三八五百萬佛郎、（三）協約國方面一二四·一五○百萬佛郎、惟法人戰區損失本利共計二千五百萬佛郎、而法人所得賠欵、乃在德國所付之半數以上、則爲確定之事實、</p>
<h3>必須有一方讓步</h3>
<p>故此次洛桑會議中、必須有人讓步而後可、苟非美國允減削戰債、俾賠欵亦可照樣減削、則恊約國勢須承認德國財政瀕於破産之事實、否則德國將被迫用超出人力以外之手段、繼續付欵、總之歷來國際會議、在如此黑暗之前途、如此矛盾之賬目、與如此微弱之成功希望中開幕者、實所罕見者也、</p>
<h3>暫停付欵問題</h3>
<p>至於會議開幕之後、暫停付欵問題、將爲舌戰焦點、在法比等九國中、勢須先將暫停付欵問題整理之後、方能談及賠欵問題之永久切實解决、</p>
<h3>六種解决辦法</h3>
<p>現胡佛停付計劃、七月一日即將期滿、故亟需在下列解决方法中、議定一種辦法、（一）胡佛停付計劃展期、（二）按照楊格計劃停付二年、（三）法國停付美國三年、（四）英國停付美國二年、（五）英國曩曾提議之停付五年或十年、（六）廢棄楊格計劃爲定新計劃、</p>
<h3>均將爲德國所反對</h3>
<p>惟德國對於此種停付辦法、均將竭力反對、德人曾明白聲明、對於僅能展緩付欵、將來仍須補繳之任何計劃、均所反對、現法比兩國主張暫停付欵、其所謂暫</p>
<p>行停付者、不過展緩付欵、期將來仍須補繳、</p>
<h3>德英意主張永久辦法</h3>
<p>德英意則主張抛棄暫停付欵之觀念、從事永久之辦法、日本或亦同具此主張、惟欲抛棄暫停付欵觀念、必須美國有取消戰債聲明、否則至少亦須允减戰債而後可云、</p>
<p>西班牙政府</p>
<h3>没收廢王産業</h3>

<p>哈瓦斯社十一日澳洲雪梨電　據最後發表之選舉結果、澳洲聯合黨獲得六十六席、工黨二十六席、内閣總理斯迭文聲言本屆選舉構成政府黨之最後勝利、由投票情形觀之、可見澳洲人民、不願放棄公債、且不能接受獨裁政治云、</p>

<h3>二嫌疑犯皆無關係</h3>
<p>路透社十一日紐約　林白妻母摩羅夫人之女僕服毒自殺後、警察拘獲疑與綁案有關者二人、但據今日確訊、此二人</p>
<p>皆無關係、一爲白林扣、康登博士初見照片、認爲付與贖欵之人、但白被捕後、康登忽稱、未曾見過此人、不能指定、同時白亦提出證據、證明林白子被綁之夜、渠與妻宿於康乃克狄克地方、一爲彭斯特、其人乃自殺女僕之情人、惟警察一再調查、亦與綁案無關、</p>

<p>戒嚴時間、請勿集會、但參加者堅持不允、高呼各種口號、散發傳單、擅將塲門啓開、一哄而入、警士阻止無效、又到卡車多輛、滿載紗廠工人學生入塲參加、總數男女在五百人以上、宣告開會、</p>
<p>驅散羣衆　市公安局以該會不服勸告、由警察大隊、將羣衆驅散、當時該會適在公推主席、一時秩序大亂、羣衆紛紛向西門斜橋兩處退去、花圈傳單旗子遺棄滿地、高呼口號、公安局並拘獲形似工人學生者多人、解總局處置、當時警察奉令、均係徒手、並未佩槍、故未發生不幸事件、</p>

<h3>颶風向北吹去</h3>
<p>上海幸免光臨</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、據徐家匯天文台職員談、昨日（十一）下午及夜問吹過上海之陣風、頗使一般人惴惴、恐颶風將於今晨（十二）光臨滬濱、幸其後接颶風消息仍向北方進行、大約將於今日吹過上海之東二百哩處、（據十二日晚間天文台報告、颶風逗留琉球附近、未曾北進、）按此次颶風、係星期五夜間發生於台灣附近之低壓中心、昨夜吹過東海、向北進發、此次低壓區域、範圍甚廣、即中國東部全區及揚子流域亦均爲低壓所籠罩、惟颶風進行路線、尙無西傾之象、至颶風風勢、據報並非異常猛烈、進行亦不甚迅速、惟本年颶風、發生若是之早、實爲可異之現象耳、</p>
<p>徐家匯天文台昨日下午四時三十分氣象預報云、東海北部天氣惡劣、因低壓似向東北東方徐徐移動所致、那霸四周、風勢仍猛、因颶風似已逗留不進、漸進息滅之故、揚子江口天陰、揚子流域漸見開霽此問沿海與台灣海峽及山東海濱一帶、均有局部發生之大霧、至颶風中心、當晨間九時許在距北緯二十六度東經一百二十六度交點一百二十哩以内、進行甚緩、有逗留之象、又昨日下午三時前二十四小時内本埠氣温最高八○·八、最低六九·八、去年同日最高八九·一、最低五八·三、</p>

<h3>呈請市府豁免捐稅</h3>
<p>上海市災區工商業復興會、昨呈市政府云、爲呈請豁免災區捐稅、仰祈鑒核照准、以資來蘇而利復興事、竊一二八日寇搆禍、閘北江灣吳淞等處、首遭浩劫、工商事業、非毁於砲火之轟炸、即被日寇之洗刦、滿目瘡痍、一片焦土、欲圖恢復、殊非易事、而豁免稅捐、實爲首要、蓋納稅雖爲國民應盡之義務、然亦須視乎人民納稅之能力、苟人民求生、猶且不遑、而復課之以各項稅捐、非特阻遏國家未來之稅源、直驅人民於益深之水火、矧閘北江灣吳淞一帶之災區、所罹之浩劫、又多爲</p>

<h3>寳山縣救濟災區意見</h3>
<p>孫熙文之公函</p>
<p>寳山縣縣長孫熙文、對於救濟本縣災區事宜、頗具熱心、曾有公函致兵災救濟會、申述意見、茲將原函錄後、逕啟者、本縣此次所受兵災、已將週歷視察情形、報告省廳查核、並向張會長曁金巨山厚城先生等詳爲面告在案、諸公當地時、彦·梓里關情·痛深切膚、一切善後及救濟辦法、想早在藎籌之中、惟是施行之際、有亟應注意者數點、管見所及、難安緘默、敢貢一得之愚、藉供採擇、查寳邑農工商業、向極凋疲、平時食力維艱、豈堪重經浩刦、不幸事變之來、全縣淪爲戰區、以太嘉寳三縣災情而論、寳邑實占全體五分之三、旣蒙省方撥欵救濟、應以受災之輕重、定撥欵之多寡、若以縣爲單位、平均支配、則將不得事理之平、我寳邑受災較重之處、亦必難普遍救濟、此關於省欵支配上、應請貴會注意者一也、鄙人視察災區經週、農事影響、已極鉅大、而小工商、則房屋旣被毁損、資本亦歸烏有、流離之苦、復業之難、較之農民、實有過之而無不及、全縣學校、大半均爲日軍佔據、毁損旣多、開學不易兒童失學過久、必將習於下流浸成社會之蠹、將來實施救濟之時、對於前述各業、似宜兼籌並顧、分别緩急、酌量受災之輕重、以爲適當之支配、此關係賑欵支配上、應請貴會注意者二也、此次兵災、受禍綦重、又承去年水災之後農工商業、幾於一蹶不振、如僅給與賑欵、而不圖善後、則救濟終難澈底、災民受賑之時、固可無慮餓莩、而受賑之後貧窮猶昔、賑欵已無餘存、待賑則仍孔亟、情形與未賑之時、初無少異、博施濟衆、堯舜　諸、濫行施捨、爲各國恤貧政策所不取、故此次救濟、與其給與、毋實低利貸借、如果秘須散放急　、亦宜力求其少、董給與則惠在一時、在災民爲儻來之財、用之每不經意、一旦用盡、後繼爲難、貨惜則必籌償還、不得不幸苦經營、萬一虧蝕本金尙有餘存、仍可再行貸借、刦後生計艱難、失師必多、倘無垂逮之圖、必將引起社會問題、爲治安前途之累、鄙意省撥欵項、如爲數不多、可於急賑之外、酌撥四五萬元、設立借本所、或因利局、規定最低利率、寛以期限、俾資周轉、如果省撥欵項、能如所預期、似可撥發十萬元、籌設地方銀行、一方低利借給農工商業、備充營業之資本、一方復經理縣庫收集遊資、運用生息旣可以調劑本邑金融、復可扶助各業與以撤興之機會　銀行成立以後、金融旣已流通、屆時可爲進一步之計劃、借地方銀行之恊助、設法多設小規模工廠、提倡手工業、收容失業及無業游民、直接增加生産、間接即可</p>
<p>維護冶安、我寳邑工商業之不能振興、地方事業之無事發展、實由於缺乏金融機關之調劑、太嘉兩縣、均有地方銀行、其錢莊事業、尤爲發達、故平時工商各業、類多繁盛、不似寳邑之凋敝、此次同一受災、而事變以後、地方各機關、即能在短時期間、粗具端倪、進行一切、雖亦由於地方較爲富庶災情較爲輕微、而主要原因、實有</p>
<p>賴於金融機關之扶助、夫財源等於人體命脈、至關重要、刦後救濟尤不可不務其遠、寳山財力不足、紳富不多、平時籌設銀行、已非容易、刦後創鉅痛深、尤難見諸事實、此次省撥欵項、爲數雖屬有限、而要皆諸公數月以來奔走呼號之所得、來源不易、倘能一變向來賑濟辦法、以散放之資財、作興業之基金、旣不背乎救濟之本旨、且不失爲振興地方之要圖、非惟一舉兩得之道、亦千載一時之機也、此關於救濟政策上、應請貴會加以注意者三也、上述數端、是否有當、尙希察酌辦理、地方幸甚、</p>

<h3>招商局整頓計劃</h3>
<p>擬借鉅欵</p>
<p>添闢航線</p>
<p>日日社云、交通部直轄招商總局、統轄沿江沿海分局凡三十餘處、營業收入總計不下數千萬、祗以各處分局開支過鉅、致總局不但無贏、且虧欠纍纍、故該部曾於五月一日起、將該局重行改組、并委由該部次長陳孚木兼任監督、陳視事後、即將</p>
<p>局務整顿、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>擴充航輪償還舊債　交部以我國年來門户洞開、外輪行駛内海江河、自由出入、致國内航商受彼排斥、比比皆是、際此政府準備收回航業之時、對於國輪非事前積極擴充、不足供將來應時之需、曾令招商局擬具妥善擴充航輪計劃、并爲澈底償清該局以前所負虧債、特向大來公司商借欵項三千萬元、提出一千萬元清償前債、餘二千萬元、專爲購添航輪、聞該項借欵、經已商妥、不日成交、</p>
<p>南洋航線定期開班　該局原有國内航線、計有滬靑長江滬粤滬甌等線、對於南洋航線、向未開闢、致我經營南洋之僑胞、往返必乘外輪、特擬開闢南洋航線、俾免華僑往來、輒受外輪壓迫、曾向挪威購進航輪一艘、定名爲「海瑞」、「海祥」專行駛南洋航班、聞定下月初正式開班、專供華僑經營商業需用、以期我國已失之海外航權、得以斬次挽回、并悉外交對於該局用人方面、及革除營業積弊等、均已擬有妥善改革之計劃云、</p>

<h3>大塲市房倒坍百餘間</h3>
<p>聲如山崩厥狀頗慘</p>
<p>老幼器皿斃毁甚多</p>
<p>大塲東鎭于胡家木橋東首、昨下午六時沿街房屋突然倒塌、一時聲如山崩、老幼啼哭、厥狀甚慘、計共坍毁一百餘間、屋中住户有不及逃出者、共二十餘人、中有數人已爲人救出、尙有多人恐已壓斃、所有屋中什物器皿、有一部份事前已由各户自行搬出、其不及搬出者、則均已壓毁、查大塲市房、甚爲老舊、滬戰期間、日機轟炸、砲彈震動、地基爲之鬆裂、此次大批坍崩、實係戰時所遺之慘果也、</p>

<p>一方可作英雄永久之紀念、一方可以安置零碎文具、此像又與外間一般攝影者不同、因蔡將軍身軀高長、攝影多不能得其正面平視像、是則參照蔣兆和氏對將軍寫生而得者、故能神似、陳列在四馬路現代書局、與國貨商塲中富公司、並可批發云、</p>

<p>器·普球之火酒熨斗·嘉定之竹刻等、亦頗不惡、茲悉主其事者、鑒於一層商塲雖具有雛型、而地位有限、未能充分發展、不免美中不足、尙有缺憾、俟會期畢後、即將原有商塲、擴大而至二樓、完成二層陳列、二層推銷、内部并再加整頓、俾臻美備云、</p>

<p>致工部局函　逕啟者、據新閘路一四零弄三號張見厚君函稱、前市民爲公共租界工部局浮收總捐一案、曾蒙貴會主持公道、函致該局糾止、並荷示復、實紉感佩、詎告該局不將浮收之數糾正發還、而於五月七日送來英文信一件、其時市民因職務他往、及本月一日返申、得見此信、市民對於英文全不知解、正在請友翻閱、前日該局華人收捐員前來收取夏季總捐、市民當將詳情細述、請其更正來收去後、不多片刻、又來兩西人、其勢洶洶、强作華語恫嚇、如不照付、即日封釘大門等云、竊思公共租界市政總捐、以房租爲標準、今工部局不求事實任意增加、違反歷來定章、且其所述之理由、全屬片面之意見、照其所謂因有亭子樓、於本年一月起、應增加租洋六元、查市民於民國十四年遷入時、此屋早已有亭子樓、並非去年新蓋、該局向來依照</p>
<p>房租收捐、從無間言、今年民衆受暴劫之痛苦、反欲加重負擔、於情於理、俱屬不該、並云市民此屋分租於人、有七十元之收入、每月有十五元至二十元之純益、此節更爲謬誤、莫說市民無此收入、即使果可分租七十元、試問房租五十元外、加市捐七元、以及電證電話修理種種之費用、何得有十五元至二十元之純益、豈非理想夢</p>
<p>囈之語耶、市民並非爲一年區區十元零八分之數、而屢凟貴會、實爲全市民衆着想、直接開該</p>
<p>局任意加捐之惡例、間接使房東有加租之憑藉、爲此不揣冒凟、繼續請求、務請貴會主張公道、轉函該局、實施糾止、至紉公誼、等情、並附貴局去函到會、查財政原則、應貴簡易、勿涉苛細、依照房客所付房租爲徵收市政總捐之標準、最足表示簡易、而免苛細、貴局因其轉租、及有亭子樓、而欲加捐、則上海方面、轉租租爲普遍現象、是否將向三房客徵收市政總捐、而於空房未轉租時、是否亦可减免總捐、至搭建亭子樓等、更足見市民居處之難、房租高貴之果、再有許多裝用水汀之房屋、其房租係包含水汀租費在内、照理收取市政捐之時、應盡水汀租費除去、而今貴局收捐、大都連水汀租費在内、甚至包於房租中之自來水費、亦收總捐、即本會會所之總捐、亦正如是、在本會觀之、市政以公平與不擾爲上、而貴局此種辦法、其動機無非一方面欲示人以公平、他方面謀公家收人之增加、但須知此適予下級員役以「上下其手」之地步、結果公家收入、所增無幾、而市民所受損失、則甚鉅矣、據函前情、相應函請貴局詳加考慮、將該項浮收之數發還、是所至盼、此致上海公共租界工部局總辦、</p>
<p>復張見厚函　逕復者六月九日大函、爲工部局估租增捐由、及工部局去函、均經誦悉、執事態度、本會極爲欽佩、蓋一介不以予人、一介不以取諸人、惟義爲歸、正我國文化之傳統精神也、除再函工部局糾正外、相應連同工部局去函檢還、復請查照爲荷、</p>

<h3>德國希望甚微</h3>
<p>經濟衰落影響運動</p>
<p>人才埋没成績退步</p>
<p>丨吾國更不如彼丨</p>
<p>德國在世界運動界中、佔强有力之地位、此次世界運動會、理宜充滿希望、不幸世界經濟衰落之狂潮、德意志適正當其衝、捲於中心、希望將受莫大打撃、選手據訉僅遣男女十九人而成績亦大告退步、能扼腕而嘆息哉、</p>
<p>體育界之窘况　經濟衰落、近來德國之運動、大生阻碍、失業恐慌、爲歐洲冠比賽之觀者、因之减去之數可驚、各體育會中有希望之選手、於是無力造就至世界競賽之標準、訓練必須比赛、觀者旣少、大運動會遂成觀望、德人對於田徑本不若撃拳與足球之普遍化、一運動會至少需六位世界選手才能吸引觀衆、而延聘世界名家表演、又非經濟力所能允許也、</p>
<p>希望遂告微弱　選手旣乏機會以試騐其成績、而求參觀國際大會之經騐、此所以今秋亞林匹克中希望微弱也、後進少年學生中、雖有不少人才、初級運動會中、亦曾有良佳表演、然此輩祗可謂之將來之希望、德國内長曾有改組全國運動界之組織、以求進步、結果亦因經濟問題而廢、</p>
<p>成績退步一斑　於是天才之發見、祗能得於偶然機會、進步不亦難哉、去秋曾有全德</p>

<h3>古廟敲鐘錄（二）（一）</h3>
<p>不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>二十四</p>
<p>朱先生進去喝了一向口茶便說：『鐘兒！請你帶我去看看學堂應該設在那兒。』我就領朱先生看大殿，這兒供奉的是如來佛。次看後殿，朱先生忽然問道：『和尙廟裏怎麽來了一位太上老君？奇怪！佛敎怎麽和道敎妥協？』我告訴他說：『這是和尙因爲進欵不敷支出，在五年前加進來的。原來離這兒十幾里路的地方有個紫霞洞。凡是村莊裏信仰道敎的人都到那兒去燒香。當我們這裏太上老君開光的那一天，和尙得意洋洋的說，「這個利權從此不致外溢了。」的確，自從太上老君進來之後，每年廟裏是多了五六十元的收入。這的尙是會做生意。』······我們走着，一忽兒就到了别殿，朱先生問：『這是些什麽菩薩？財神我認得！那些是什麽？』我一一回答說：『這是痲神，這是蠶神，這是牛神。』朱先生說：『我猜想這一切的一切怕都是和尙老板的夥計吧。那個頂會做買賣？』我說：『這要看流年。前年小孩子出天花的頂多，痘神是走了紅運。去年春蠶發瘟，蠶神門市竟賽過財神。』朱先生說：『這是多麽有趣的一個店舖呀！』我說：『現在旣要改做學生，總得把這些菩薩移動移動，使得小學生有個地方坐才是。小學生便是我們的活菩薩，等他們都坐到這裏來，那時廟中必定是另有一番新的氣象。』朱先生開始說我所不能懂的話了。他歎了一口氣說：『如果呌小學生一個一個的都坐到這裏來，他們也就變成泥塑木雕的菩薩了。那時這些小朋友便成了先生糊口的小夥計，如同菩薩做和許多小學生嗎？這葫蘆裏是裝了什麽藥？朱先生繼續的問，『還有地方可看嗎？』『没有了！』是我的簡短的答復。朱先生又說：『學堂好比是一條老牛，這幾間房子不過是牛身上的一根毛，只是一根毛！』我心中可着急了。朱先生顯然是瞧不起我們這個古廟。我萬分的憂慮，怕他不願意做我們這裏的先生。這，這，這該怎麽辦呢？</p>

<h3>養生之道</h3>
<p>— 梅花</p>
<p>養生之道，一言以蔽之，在不摧殘本性。本性的摧殘是從浪用精神起頭。精神是要用的，可是浪費了，就要傷元氣。</p>
<p>喫，着，嫖，賭，都是浪用精神的表現。官僚政客的奔走，鑽營，興風，作浪，也無非是浪用精神。你若要問吾如何養生，吾除了保養本性以外，根本就說不出什麽大道理來。衛生固然要緊，可是衛生亦未必定能延年益壽。</p>
<p>孔子是最講衛生的。孔子最講究飲食。他飲食的條件最嚴格。「食饐而餲，魚餒而肉敗，不食。色惡，不食。臭惡，不食。失飪，不食。不時，不食。」甚至「割不正，不食。不得其醬，不食。」孔子這樣講究飲食，結果僅活得七十三歲。</p>
<p>吾的父親享年七十五，母親享年八十九，姊姊享年九十三，他們對於飲食，並不如何講究，但是他們都有一種統一的好習慣，就是早起，他們都有古人「鷄鳴而起」的精神。</p>
<p>吾從小就有早起的習慣。吾的母親在老清早就要吩咐吾念經，背書，有時，吾剛起床，連衣裳都没有穿好，嘴裏就要喃喃的念經了。</p>
<p>上海人大多數没有早起的習慣，其實以前也很能早起。吾初來上海的時候，店舖在日出以後就要除排門開店，否則閒人就要來敲門呐喊：</p>
<p>吾想到了現在，若在日出時候開舖門，人家定要笑他發神經病。</p>
<h3>哈爾濱</h3>
<p>— 逢吉</p>
<p>自暴日侵佔東三省。哈爾濱一埠。幾爲日俄逐鹿之塲。中國抱不抵抗主義。至今仍一籌莫展。而熱血津湧之義軍。縱横馳騁。大有誓復河山之氣概。哈爾濱地位之嚴重可知。述其最近略史。或亦閱者所願睹歟。</p>
<p>哈爾濱係滿洲語。前清時。由阿城副都統管轄。三十年前。荒凉寂寞。三五漁家之村落也。</p>
<p>光緒二十二年。俄人要求闢爲商埠。我國爲敦睦邦交起見。允劃五百方里爲俄租界。哈爾濱之名。於是大著。不二十五年。一變而爲亞東重要商塲。可北追烟津。南比滬瀆。俄人至有東方聖彼得堡之稱。時亦妄乎之曰東京。蓋視俄之聖彼得堡爲西京也。</p>
<p>哈爾濱地居滿蒙之中心爲北滿管鑰。交通利便。航路有松花黑龍兩江。上駛歷扶餘老少溝諸埠。下駛經依蘭富錦黑河等地。直達俄境之伯力廟兒克。陸路南通長春。與南滿接軌。可達日韓。東至海參崴。北與烏蘇利接軌。經西伯利亞。直達歐洲。四通八達。誠遠東重鎭。北滿之要埠也。</p>
<p>哈爾濱重要區域。即道裏道外二區。道裏本名八站。道外本名埠頭。因中有鐵道相隔。故有裏外之稱。道外完全爲中國商市。幾無俄人居住。道裏則純爲俄人市面。亦間有華人居住者。兩區商界情形。逈然不同。市政管理。亦因之而分軒輊。惟俄人自歐戰後。無力建築。市廛不免蕭條。旅館頗多。且均甚清凈。來往交通有汽車馬車人力車等。馬車每小時大洋七八角。人力車稍廉。御車者道裏多俄人。華人亦間有之。如不諳俄語。雇車殊覺困難</p>
<p>道裏最熱閙之街。爲中國大街。一切應有盡有。火車站離道裏藥舖街不遠。馬車需二十分鐘可達。北平漢口上海海參崴朝鮮日本等處。均有聯票。惟購此種聯票及臥車票。須在車站斜對面之萬國公車售票處内。預先訂購。車站上無此種聯票出售也。</p>
<h3>壬申小滿後七日與宣閣同赴霍必蘭路謁朱古微宗伯墓</h3>
<p>— 鹤柴</p>
<p>首夏清和雨乍晴。霍蘭路僻肯偕行。仍看芍藥舒金帶。且值扶桑罷甲兵。鬰鬰佳城詞客渺。錚錚舊史諫書鳴。（庚子歲公爲翰林苑侍講學士上疏力請剿拳匪）浮雲變滅何須道。惟願花時酬一觥。</p>
<h3>唐多令</h3>
<p>— 宣閣</p>
<p>首夏隨鹤柴先生謁朱古微宗伯墓晴軟雨餘天。風和扇不忺。悄郊原新綠濺濺。過了晚春都是怨。莫忘却。在山泉。誰識舊霜絃。文宗地下眠。寫秋詞凄絶幽燕。腸斷鸕鴣天一関。人世事。太淹煎。</p>
<h3>可笑可憐之一事</h3>
<p>— 公羽</p>
<p>頃有友自他埠來。告予一事。大足爲旅行家之殷鑑。友曰。予此次係乘火車來滬。登車之時。乘客不甚擁擠。有一靑年女子。貌固呹麗。裝飾尤華貴入時。與予同時上車。座位亦相近。車中乘客旣少。婦女更少。靑年時裝女子又僅彼美一人。故乘客交相注視。幾成衆矢之的。彼美則泰然自若。初無羞怯態。意必爲曾受學校敎育。或所謂摩登女郎也。無何。車抵一站。有乘客若干人上。隙座將滿。又未幾抵一大站。乘客上下更多。車中頓覺擁擠。有一西裝少年。手提革囊。上車後。舉目四矚。見無隙座。略呈不愉之色。旋又欣然。逕至女郎許。蓋彼美佔地甚寛。他人或皆以其爲靑年華貴女子。自慚形穢。不欲與之擠座。故任之。此少年之心理。迨適相反。且以與美人並肩而坐爲樂。遂逕往擠得座位也。初。女郎以一人佔得一人以上之座位。自覺甚寛。及少年坐下。則又覺其太窄。儼然爲有關係之一雙兩好矣。如是者又越數站。每站胥有乘客上下。最初目撃女郎一人上車者。已寥寥無幾。後登者見女郎與少年並肩而坐。尢多誤會爲美眷或情侣。惟予則始終未易座次。冷眼旁觀。知之甚晰。忽聞兩人已絮絮交談。爲狀且至親暱。不覺詫甚。暗思近時代所謂社交公開。泯除男女界限觀念者。固如斯夫。已而又抵一站。車戞然停。當然有乘客上下。女郎起立亦凭窗。觀車外景物。少年亦起立。以一手撫其肩。爲狀之親。更不啻伉儷。女忽驚呼曰。噫。如何是好。少年亟問何故。女郎謂插於髮際之鑽釵。忽墮車外。行人衆多。轉瞬將爲他人拾去。奈何。奈何。少年探首窗外視之。果然。乃告奮勇曰。汝在此監視之。容余下車拾取。言已。怱怱</p>
<h3>廉儉救國說（九）</h3>
<p>— 聶曾紀芬述男其杰撰文</p>
<p>當時情事。大類今日。管孟之慨歎。曹生之痛哭。皆爲此而發。集多數重利輕義寡廉鮮恥之人。雖救以十倍歐美之軍備。惟以自殘。且以資敵。反是苟能行禮義廉恥之敎。則貪惡汚劣之行。爲清議所不容。其力勝於法律之懲罰也。豪奢爭欺之習。爲社會所共棄。其效尤捿於政令之制裁也。如是則人入心中。自具壁壘。以爲戰守。商販不羨洋貨重利之可圖而售銷。士民不羨舶來物品之精美便利而購買。此眞堅壁清野之法也。今日各國金融恐慌。皆有不可終日之象。凡恃武力稱霸及經濟侵略之國。早晚有崩潰之可能。其暫得不潰者。持其所侵略之國以資財供給之耳。即如我國每年購外貨二十萬萬元之巨欵。其中至少有半數。爲供敵國海陸空軍之餉源。及炸彈軍械之材料也。夫以錢供敵。人皆不欲居此惡名。而竟有此事實者。欲念所驅使也。此心中之漢奸賣國賊也。誠能人人除心中之賊。彼一切侵略之具將無所用之。爾時各國之人。亦當覺悟此法之善。而急起仿效。自除其奢侈之嗜好。廢其無益之工業。裁其自殺之軍備。相與還醇返本。睦鄰修好。世界和平。可坐而致。而其消息則於各個人之克己制欲决之。欲念一日不停。則侵略國之餉源一日不竭。戰禍一日不止。蓋個人之欲念影響於世界之治亂者。如此其鉅也。</p>
<p>下車。維時予亦爲女郎着急。注視其墮釵不瞬。亦若代爲監視。免爲人拾去者。少年拾得後。復怱怱上車。而露得色。顧上車後。又頓易爲驚惶態。舉目四矚。一如初登車時覓座不得然。予方異之。旋即發覺女郎已杳。始知少年驚惶之故。少年至原坐處。上下尋檢多時。面色益慘沮。鄰座詰之。少年曰。余失去一革囊。其中貯有重要文件。及鈔票三千元。文件之價值。且十倍於鈔幣。君等曾見之乎。鄰座曰。汝曷爲驚惶如是。此革囊仍在汝之家人手。隨汝下車去矣。汝何又一人上車耶。少年初猶不解。旣乃省悟。不禁頓足曰。誤矣誤矣。彼非我家人。且與我素昧平生。即在車中相識者也。此語鄰座猶不解。而予則了然於胸。甚以少年爲可笑可憐焉。</p>
<h3>吃肉不如吃魚</h3>
<p>— 守眞</p>
<p>科學家研究各種肉食，及其價值，認定魚類，價值頗高。健康生活所需的維生素，及礦，魚類都能供給。油，礦質，蛋白質，魚類所含，實無遜色。</p>
<p>魚類所含礦質，特别豐富：鎂，鈉，鉀，錪，礦黄，綠氣等等，莫不俱備。魚油，尤其是魚肝油，飽含着維生素ＡＢ。魚子，則充滿了維生素Ａ。</p>
<p>魚類的蛋白質，對於身體發育，及其健康，貢獻尤大。近來，科學家的興趣，特别集中於其所含錪之研究。因爲含錪富饒的食物，足妈防止喉疾。</p>
<p>各種魚類，所含錪量不一。蟹最少，暇最多，而海扇與文蛤，則介乎二者之間。大概鹹水魚含錪尤富。</p>
<p>美國公共衛生研究委員會，對於魚類，研究頗詳。其結論：爲魚類介類，均爲良好食物。一來，營養充分，消化容易。油，磺質，蛋白質丨有時多量的維生素丨色色俱全。二來，價格低廉，便利平民不淺云。</p>

<h3>戎馬雙棲記（七七）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第九回　附專車逐客有虚驚　坐冷衙化石成遐想</p>
<p>安玉田靜極思動。暗想到此還未與葉作章謀面。何不逕上衙門去謁見。竟又忘了梁笑雲的叮囑。僱了部汽車自去。仗著前兩天小毛已替他領到一方徽章。掛在馬褂襟紐上。倒摇摇擺擺的闖進衙内、找著了承啓處。踏進裏面一看。只見一間大客廳内坐滿了各色各樣的人。有穿軍服的。有着便服的。有老的。有少的。有黄毛碧眼的外國人。又還有方外的和尚。很像個人類的陳列館。他找個空椅子坐定。好半晌。也没有人來理他。更没有一盃茶或一枝烟來奉獻。旋見一個帶少校肩牌的武裝軍官。從内裏一所暗間裏走出來。手裏抓着一大把名片。似洗撲克牌一樣在掌心裏翻來覆去的搬弄。就又有旁座的人拿名片近前去鞠躬陪笑。他料想這必是專司傳達的承啓官了。便也掏一張印好官銜的名片。走攏去遞上。并很謙恭的說道。勞駕。我來見督軍。請你通報一聲。那承啓官翻著白眼。將名片和他的面部全瞅了一徧。又從恍惚像傷了風的鼻孔裏微微哼了一聲道。等一等。就大模大樣的揚長走了。他奉命仍坐回去等著。外面却還有一班一班新來的人陸續上座。但其中也有趾高氣揚非常熟溜的。一進門並不在外問坐。逕奔到裏間門邊。揭開白布門帘就高呌著處長或大哥。隨後那承啓官又復進來。嘴裏嚷著請某人請某官。十有八九都是在裏問屋廟那些熟溜不過的人欣然答應。一批批跟了那承啓官出去。這外間座上的衆人。很少被傳。只呆看着别人像走馬燈般出出進進。仍須極規矩極靜穆的正襟危坐在等候著。這一候足候了四個多鐘頭。安玉田拚命吸完了一包紙烟。只弄得嘴唇發焦心。心頭發躁。腿酸腰脹。飢渴交加。但得不著見不見的準信。又還不敢隨便就走。不由暗自想道。這又該我再受一回禁錮的罷了。似此再坐候下去。不難把肉身練成一座天然的化石呢。究竟這個罪要受到什麽時候才完。且待下回分說。</p>

<p>絶無有力的變動　上週間標金復趨堅秀、惟無過大變幻、日僅四五兩盤旋、至多八兩曲折、藎國外並無重要消息、自週初即跌、開盤七百十二兩半、因銀市續漲之影蠁、旋後卒見七百十一兩八錢之低價、惟中央銀行有現金運輸出口之說、當轉上乘、殆美銀報跌、匯兌趨小、尤以現金竭涸、中央吸收甚般、乃市價邁進、衝出七百兩以外、至週三因逢習俗端節、休假一天、旋以掉期逼近、多方擬欲敲大、竟預計十兩、但照美金七月掉八月應貼二五、（核計六兩）以此空頭懼怯、遂予抵進、直到週五最大爲七百二十九兩、惟復以賣者似勤、稍呈反響也、週六收市爲七百二十四兩八錢、比較前週六回漲九兩一錢、金週共有十七兩二錢廻顧、至於海外銀市英平美跌、而滙兌計英對美回跌一分八七五、美對英回小二分一二五、以致滬市滙豐掛牌計英金平而美金微縮、至内部英金扯平、美金近期回縮一八七五、遠期三一二五、實乃匯兌之關係、金業中扒回近期、抛出遠期、間有套回條子、然結價計撳七十兩内外、茲查交易所驚碼共二萬三千二一百條、各號如萬興順利大連帮仍占多頭、又乾昌祥竟多五千有奇、義豐永亦有三千餘條、元興永丙興等亦然、廣帮所多無幾、而空方計元茂永大德成各有二千餘條、其餘大致零户也、茲將一週間經過概况摘錄於后、</p>
<p>五日來清平的迴顧（週一）大條銀續長零六二五、美銀長二五、滙兌尙平、故先令美金掛牌未更、内盤亦平、至標金初開即小去三兩二錢、爲七百十二兩半、次爲十三兩半、然賣多卒爲十一兩八錢、俄頃得聞中央現金裝出、人心即好、買方逞勇、竟漲爲十九兩六錢、未幾時退爲十六兩六錢、乃賣户亦屬活動、迨午收十七兩四錢、下午十六兩七錢開市、廣帮來進、爲十八兩八錢、迨收市十八兩、比上週六回漲二兩三錢、形勢複雜、晨仆後起、全日有七兩八錢曲折、福餘恒餘志豐永及吳某追進。</p>
<p>（週二）大條勿更、銀價見縮、先令如前、内部英硬美軟、乃滙兌輒小也、金市開盤七百十九兩半、計加一兩半、旋以大户爭買、穿出七百二十兩、爲廿四兩二錢、收市二十兩八錢、下午二十兩開盤、次爲二十一兩六錢、市况頗平、交易寥寥、收市二十兩零六錢、比上日又加二兩六錢、是日有六兩上落、</p>
<p>（週三）大條續長○六二五、銀價反縮一二五、滙兌均已報小、惟逢端午、銀行休假、故金市亦停一天、</p>
<p>（週四）大條近期頻長○六二五、遠期勿更、美銀如前、先令仍無升降、惟美金縮一二五、内盤英平美似堅、殆金市初開即漲三兩二錢、爲二十三兩八錢、因銀價輒縮之故、以後稍有進退、中央吸現金、曾漲爲二十六兩、復以大連帮等脫手、退至二十一兩四錢、收市爲二十二兩三錢</p>
<p>下午二十一兩七錢開市、旋後求過於供、且中央續吸現金、遂爲二十五兩二錢、迨收市二十四兩九錢、比上日再漲四兩三錢、全日不過四兩六錢差次、茲聞中央共吸現金八百數十條、價爲七百二十二兩至二十三兩半、檯而上大連帮賣出、廣帮則進、</p>

<h3>厘續下跌拆趨昂勢</h3>
<p>星期日市况岑寂</p>
<p>昨因值星期、銀行休業、市况因之岑寂、塲中做開洋　市價、較前日依然趨跌、早市爲六錢九分一釐半、午市六錢九分一釐、結果較前日早市仍小一釐有半、趨勢之弱、仍未稍减、銀拆以星期頭襯略緊、故市價頓昂九分、計有一錢二分之昂價、做出匯劃票欵早市十一萬五千、午市五十八萬、鈔票祗午市三萬、塲外交易兩市均無做開、拆票交易早市三百七八十萬、午市二三十萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百二十餘萬、銀公單收解二千一百餘萬、銀行收解以封關無可採記、小錢莊交易三十餘萬、江南小洋早午市因無交易、市價均同爲五錢九分五釐、廣東小洋爲五錢八分九釐半、午市爲五錢八分八釐半、交易早市九萬五千角、午市一萬五千角、銅元加長五百文、爲四百二十四千文、</p>

<h3>上週債市清疲</h3>
<p>成交一千七百五十萬</p>
<p>上星期（自六月六日至十一日）内本埠華商證劵交易所債市情形、除週三以端節停市外、餘日均照常開拍、買賣人氣冷淡、期貨交易一千七百五十七萬元、較前週相差約逹一千零九十萬元、現貨進出亦稀、全週共成交十九萬五千元、至言各債價趨勢、則爲時局形　沉悶、國内外情况無新發展、大户觀望、求供均衡、價無大漲跌、且本埠自經戰事以來、各業一時未易恢復、市面蕭條、金融呆滯、而上屆結帳之期又近、各業須爲結束、雖投資收進者仍有其人、但多懷審愼態度、未見有鉅額成交、以是供過於求、價則盤旋回跌、惟勢殊穏定、每日僅數角上落耳、結果比前星期除編遣關稅僅小半元左右、其他多回跌一元至一元六七角不等、獨二零捲鹽稅等下月戎下降約達一元、察目下環象情况、實覺沉悶、如環象一時無明顯進步、前途將愈見沉寂、難望轉機、故在上屆結帳前、債劵市殊鮮發展之望也、茲將上週内各債劵價高低漲落情形、分列如下表、（單位元）</p>

<h3>上週紗市日趨軟化</h3>
<p>世界潮流險惡前途樂觀少</p>
<p>醖釀已久之紗市、在上週間裂痕突現、市勢日向軟途推進、本應早有下跌可能、因本埠底貨單薄、南埠現紗需要雖無大量、然零星交易尙不間斷、故多頭拉緊不放、後以海外花紗狀况日現不穏美棉跌破五分陣綫、而國内社會經濟破産、農村衰落、各方荒象頻報、紗銷往後恐無希望、於是人心驟現恐怖之狀、新抛户蜂擁而來、由此市盤跌風又熾、但有一部份仍以底盤己小、做多心意向濃、然查世界物價均在狂落中、本紗與外紗比較萬難穏定、過去本紗市價之高、有某種關係、近日原料太廉、以致棉紗本身成本問題輕賤、所以情勢懸殊、故日商在四方銷紗猛力、據云價格特廉、尙有利可圖、因之華北一帶被其塞滿、本紗幾成絶望、華廠在此原料便宜之際、速想脫售、以資競爭、有一部份廠商對於囤貨、已有困難之說、另有消息、天津華紗去化呆滯、有運滬求出路之說、足見華廠營業方針幼稚、總之世界潮流險惡、前途樂觀甚少、查全週各帮買去現紗統計三千四百十五包、同行中三百零七包、行情比前週跌三四兩、標紗有大户抛出及多頭了結、各月價比前週跌四兩七·八·九錢、全週成交統計十二萬零九百五十包、茲將各帮買去之額分誌如下、</p>

<p>世界棉市慘落聲中</p>
<h3>上週棉市衰極</h3>
<p>棉市在上週間頗形不穏、跌風銳利、以世界棉市慘落、美棉竟發現百年間未有之新低峯、五分關口業已衝破、人心大起恐怖、上海各洋行在市兜售美棉米特林　二十七兩、尙有水餉回扣除去一兩、包額愈巨、價格尙可再廉、然各廠鑒於大勢不良、皆不顧吸收、故未成交、此棉可仿製二十支用、於是消息傳來、商塲上更現不安、且有大户抛賣、市盤大有江河日下之概、但申地一般棉商、因標棉二十九兩之價、數年罕見、認爲便宜、可購做多、故每日購進、然一視美棉及世界物價之低、爲空前未有也、（十一日電通社東京電）據外務省所得情報、美國因棉産地、天氣</p>
<p>良好、及總選舉前政局不安、棉市漸跌、七月期已暴跌至四仙以上之新低價、特基賽斯州當局預料八月一日之陳棉滾存額、將增加一千三百</p>
<p>萬包内外、而産棉各外國、亦以本年度産額增加、美棉銷路將頓行减少、均預料本秋美棉將跌至一仙以上云、（即二分以上）跌至二分以上之價、此預料未免太低、總之察觀大勢、樂觀較少、所以照外棉情形比較、本棉何能立脚、據聞北路存貨充足、大數尙未運出、標棉前途、樂化不敢預卜也、標棉一週間跌去一兩八九錢、全週成交統計二十萬零五百擔、美棉比前週跌十磅音、碼頭上來源計姚花二千七百七十包、通花一百五十包、茲將各廠買去現棉量額、分誌於後、</p>

<p>絲茶上週海外華絲市場</p>
<h3>充滿一片下跌聲</h3>
<p>頻現從未見過之新低價</p>
<p>上週中本埠洋莊絲市、已陷絶望、緣歐美絲織廠自經濟廢落以來、重用人造絲、以期减輕成本、生絲消費大减、日絲商雖一兩跌價、圖銷陳絲、</p>
<p>奈需要不起、絲銷仍無轉機之望、華絲則隨日絲而步趨疲勢、跌風未衰、迭現巨古以來未有之新低價、廠經等依然有行無市、滬去電、仍鮮轉滬、週間期現絲市續呈疲靜、各廠商手中三四萬包之陳絲、求銷無路、自江浙新　已運滬、絲廠開工者全市仍祗十分之一、大半代客繅製陳繭、新絲均未抛開、市氣停滯、絲銷絶望、殊非短時期内可望起色耳、上週海外華絲價徒聞一片傾跌聲、日均有行無市、殊乏紀載之價值云、</p>
<h3>疋頭皮面雨衣布暢銷一時</h3>
<p>雨衣布銷塲、近年來步步　增、上春頭市銷更暢、允以現在　時將屆之際、更爲旺銷、每星期統扯、洋行方面出貨有二十件之繼、但市盤售價</p>
<p>、依然疲弱、大有江河日下之勢、此皆因到貨太多之故耳、皮面雨衣布乃目前最新盛行者也、因之銷塲特别廣暢、申地風行一時、西裝雨衣咸多選取此料、昨奸華貨躉批每碼售元二兩七錢五分（查舊歲第一次到申售過三兩八九錢）紫醬黄褐色較元灰色爲暢俏、本埠大小各西服舖子、統有購備云云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白市形略挫</h3>
<p>國産惠安白號開三百餘包</p>
<p>昨日糖市會市場劃盤交易略靜進出均懈、荷糖二十四號粗砂白、成交價至十三兩九錢半、受手且寥、市形較前微挫、中砂白貨缺市堅、但交易亦微、九號荷赤九兩九錢頗爲俏手、八號貨次者九兩六錢半、大昌曾有售出、太古糖Ｂ嘜十六兩二錢半、ＣＷ嘜十五兩九錢、趨勢堅挺、但交易轉寥、下描如ＤＹ嘜等則以市存缺乏、需要尙殷、第以該公司定價較昂、以致相持而未有成交云、又惠安上白糖、昨廣帮志誠興號到三百餘包、開十三兩五錢、受手殊衆、隨即清盤、該糖乃粤東著名土産、香味濃厚、糖力極足、</p>
<p>與舶來品有上下床之别、惜到貨不多、而買客進胃甚健、故市勢異常挺秀、又海南赤砂昨亦開出二百餘包、價九兩四錢、比前漲起二錢、該貨砂色嬌黄、而糖質實駕乎洋亦之上、該號現尙有存現、扳九兩八錢方允脫手云、</p>
<h3>海味螟蜅鮝洋生旺發</h3>
<p>頭水捕獲八千擔···市價步賤</p>
<p>新螟晴鮝、今庚洋生大發、如寗波之衢山·岱山·舟山·駱華等處、漁船放洋、莫不滿儎而歸、刻查各山撩上總數、已有八千擔之巨、且尙有二水可捕、倘如天時放晴、魚頭不散、則再撩三四千擔不奇、如此旺發、誠所罕遇、查去年額、僅有五千六七百擔、今乃倍之有餘、故漁户莫不喜形於色、惟來源旣多、人心向下、所以市價步賤、昨售高統貨二十八兩、普通二十七兩、至二十六兩不一、客帮去化冷淡、行家又未敢厚存、故後首勢防續鬆云、</p>

<h3>懲治貪汚專庭</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>前日京電，懲治貪汚專庭案，正由司法部起草懲治條例及組織規則，一俟草竣，經立法院通過公布。</p>
<p>在此又廉又潔的政府之下，原不應再會發現貪贓枉法的官吏，但自近年來，看看各部院，各機關，循良的政續，一些没有表見，只聽得某也買某大洋房爲住宅，某也購某大花園爲别墅，某新娶嬌妻，某新納豔妾，我不解在此廉潔政府之下，何來此偌大金錢，以供其窮奢極欲的資料，這原是一個很大的疑點。</p>
<p>「竊鈎者誅，竊國者侯」原是我國政治上的傳統政策，現在特設懲治貪汚法庭，天然又是幾位竊鈎的仁兄倒霉，但是竊鈎者流，比比皆是，懲不勝懲，治不勝治，結果惟有再做一篇官樣文章，「殺一隻狗，給活猻看看」，此外無非處於超法律的地位，所謂鴻飛冥冥，弋人何纂。</p>

<h3>談談無綫電</h3>
<p>— 丁柱中</p>
<p>」無綫電」是「無綫電報」，「無綫電話」和「無綫電像」的簡稱，要知道「無綫電」的長處，先要知道「有綫電報」和「有綫電話」的短處：</p>
<p>（一）兩地距雖太遠的時候，電綫和電柱的費用太大，東亞與歐美之間的海底電纜，每綫動需幾百萬金。</p>
<p>（二）電綫和電柱之巡查極感不便，尤其是那海底電纜。愛爾蘭與紐芬蘭之間在西歷一八六五年設一海底電纜過大西洋，方將告成便斷而失去，經過了好多年纔尋獲。</p>
<p>（三）空中的飛機，海洋上的行船，不能裝置固定的電綫，便不能與各地互通消息，尤其是遇險的時候，簡直無法呼援。</p>
<p>（四）世界上那些慘無人道的戰爭，常以割斷敵人的電綫爲能事。其他一切的事業勢必隨之而受莫大的影響。</p>
<p>（五）電綫的長短和電能的大小是成反比例的，電綫越加長，電能就越减小。因此，兩地距離太遠時，電話就不能通達。</p>
<p>科學家爲着要掃除這些短處，要貢獻最經濟最有效力的用品於人類，便繼續不斷的苦求改進；果然在一九零一年十二月十二日那一天，科學上放出了驚奇的光明：馬可尼（Msroconi）在英國接到了美國的電報。這個横渡大西洋的電報。是没有用電綫傳遞的丨丨陸上没有用架空的電綫，水裏没有用海底的電纜</p>
<p>馬氏是意大利人，在本國弄不着實騐費，便跑到英國。在一八九四年得了英國電報局的資助，便開始實騐「無綫電報」；在一八九六年就實騐成功了，但是只能隔一又四分三英里（約合五華里）的距離通信；到了一八九年，英國的戰艦便能隔八十五英里通消息（約合二百四十華里）；後來他力求改進，傳報的距離便逐漸增大，到底能使「無綫電報」通達全球。</p>
<p>他在「無綫電報」上更求改進，在一九零八年又把「無綫電話」實騐成功了。從一九一八年以來，因眞空管（即無綫電收音機上的燈泡）之發明，「無綫電」</p>
<p>進步極速，所以「無綫電話」能夠把優美的音樂或名人的演講播送到全球，便全球上的人們可以藉收音機來傾聽，好像聚在一室裏一般。</p>
<p>美國電話電報公司和西方電氣公司合力研究，發明了「電像」，在一九二五年實騐成功了；就是藉電流的變化，把人的像或其他的物像或字畫，由此地傳到彼地，例如美國人在一九二六年五月將照片由惡海約（Ohio）省傳到紐約。但是兩地之間是用電綫傳遞的。到了一九二七年七月，法國人發明了「無綫電像」，也是像電報電話一樣的省去了兩地之間所藉以通電的導綫。現代的科學家正在那兒爭先恐後的研侒，成績甚爲卓著。</p>
<p>這樣看來，世界上一切的聲音，一切的影像，到底不是山川所能阻隔的了。「千里眼，順風耳」這兩句古話，於今被科學證實了。</p>
<p>學書寫生</p>
<h3>如此學校</h3>
<p>— 岩野</p>
<p>老王吃了十多年的南貨飯，還是一個窮得家徒四壁，他想再這樣下去，不要說仰事俯蓄，怕個人的生活也將不能維持了，他見上海各弄各里弦誦之聲不絶，心想開個學堂，倒是一門好生意罷，主意旣定，東西設法，籌集了二百金，在一個小弄中租賃了一個單幢房子，自己和妻兒住了一個亭子樓，樓上借給人家，樓下客堂就作爲課堂，弄了十幾副課桌課椅，一塊黑板，買一個鈴，再買幾張紙國旗，向空中一掛，看來倒也很像一所學堂了，鉛皮校牌早已掛在門口，招生廣告也已貼出，各里的拖鼻涕的兒童，居然絡繹而來，一堂濟濟，座無虚設，老王覩此，自然笑逐顔開，</p>
<p>從此老王便開始做他的猢孫王，並玥唱他的獨脚戲，大狗呌，小狗跳，居然敎得朗朗上口，敎了幾天，他覺得一班在敎，其餘的人没事做而在敎室中擾亂，很不方便，便給他想出一個妙法，就是把敎不到的人統都趕他們到五尺地方的天井中去頑，全校共分三班，上半天上三課，恰巧每班上着一課，陳平宰肉，再平均没有了，下半天也是這樣，　　一星期後，他又覺得這個方法不妙，因爲天井中的擾亂聲，時時度窗而入，使敎室中人不安，便再焦思改良之法，結果又給他得了一個妙法，把許多人都以進來坐下，敎着的聽先生敎，敎不着的一律寫字，從此果然清靜了許多，他很滿意於這個敎授法，他也每以此敎授法向人自吹，</p>
<p>過了兩星期，一個赤着脚拖着涕的孩子對他說，先生！我爸爸敎我問你，爲什麽人家學堂裏敎算法，我們這裏没有呢？</p>
<p>這一語把老王提醒了，不錯，新法念書是少不掉算法的，但我没有學過，怎樣敎呢，他想了多時，便聲色俱厲的回答那孩子說誰說没有，遲幾天自然敎啦，這天的夜裏，他便去買來的一本初小一年級用的算術書，懸樑錐股，簡練揣摩，連下五夜苦工，居然會寫出一加一等於二，五减三等於二的算式來，他旣豁然貫通了這些，立刻便傳授諸生，三班學生一律敎加減法，已經學過的學生，便在黑板上多寫幾個題目給他們做，說小學祇要會加减法就好了，祇要做得多，做得快與熟，便一身受用不盡，</p>
<p>一個月後，他又給學生要求敎唱歌，他一想唱歌也是新法念書中不可少的，而又想到六十歲學打拳，這「獨來米沙」一時是學不會的了，幸而他有一個十六七歲的外甥，在一個小學四年級讀書，便拉他來一星期敎兩小時，從此他這個學堂裏，有國文，有寫字，有唱歌，有加减法，他益覺自吹是一個新法學堂了，</p>
<p>他這個學校開辦到現在，快一年了，他還是牢守着這個敎法，將來有無再好些的妙法，我也時時刻刻在注意着，假使有新發現，我將不吝我墨我筆，並不惜本刋篇幅，來告與讀者知道，使修上海敎育史的人，也好多得一些資料，</p>
<p>雖幕</p>
<h3>從鴿籠裏發出來的牢騷</h3>
<p>— 曼倩</p>
<p>自從這次暴日侵略淞滬，學校被燬，遷滬開學後，我們宿舍是學校替我們租的一幢二層樓洋房，什麽亭子間，客堂間，廂房，一共算起來，也不到五間，並且客堂還騰出來做了膳廳，當然的七八十人多住在這裏，祗有擠得滿坑滿谷了。</p>
<p>在以前天氣，比較寒凉，擠一點倒還無妨，但是如今天氣一天熱似一天，一二十人擠在一塊，一股股的汗酸臭，直向鼻中鑽入，加上大家睡的，都是地舖，蚊帳失了他的效用，於是晚上儘蚊蚋作威作福，優得没一晚得好睡，因此敎室裏，洋台上，晒台上，漸漸的都做了我們的殖民地，雖然要早捲夜攤，麻煩一些，但比了大家擠在一處，却好得多。</p>
<p>至於上課的敎室，在附近又租的房屋，敎室的狹小，祗及普通二分之一，上海空氣，本來汚濁，加上一間裏三四十人的呼吸，那等在裏面的難過，更不堪設想了，有時實在悶得太厲害，幾乎</p>
<p>全堂的欠伸欲睡，又因爲門口種種小販的呌賣聲再不能專一地注意在書本上。</p>
<p>更談到最難解决的大小便問題。一幢房屋的，本來有兩隻抽水馬桶，但是不知怎的，却却壞了一隻，所以賸餘的一隻，要對付七八人，實在感到供不應求，若一旦的糞急，或是犯了瀉症，那眞没辦法。</p>
<p>種種的情形，也說不盡許多，總之在這種生活之下，處處予我人以一個大大不安，啊，推根究底，這次暴日的賜與，眞使我刻不容忘的。</p>
<p>編者按，倘此文而果係事實，請開學店的老閶，摸些良心出來，不要把人家子弟，當做猪　一般看待吧。</p>

<h3>Relief for War Zone Education</h3>
<p>By Bin</p>
<p>The recent bloody resistance against Japan. The war zones of Shanghai's Wusong, Baoshan, Jiading, and Taicang have suffered extremely severe disasters. We only need to inspect the Zhabei war zone today to see that the once prosperous city market is now merely a scene of broken walls and shattered tiles lying desolate on the ground. The traces of fire and the remnants of artillery shells are still vividly new. From the tragic situation in Zhabei, we can infer that the other war zones are undoubtedly the same. Now that the war has ceased and the Japanese army is gradually withdrawing, how to provide relief to these severely afflicted war zones, how to comfort the displaced and destitute victims, and how to revive the industries and businesses in the war zones, are all extremely important issues currently at hand.</p>
<p>To resolve this extremely important issue, organizations such as the Shanghai Municipal War Zone Rehabilitation Preparatory Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Committee have recently been planning for the rehabilitation of the war zones. Moreover, most of those participating in these organizations are elites from all walks of life. Detailed discussions have been held at various meetings, such as on the issue of relief for farmers in the war zones and on relief for the economy of the common people. We can predict that in the future, good results will certainly be obtained. However, there is something we must particularly contribute to the gentlemen of the Rehabilitation Committee, namely that the revival of education in the war zones should be given serious attention.</p>
<p>The reason why relief for education in the war zones must be particularly emphasized is that thousands of young people have had their studies interrupted by this war, and some may even lose the opportunity to pursue education altogether. The impact of this on the future lives of these thousands of young people, as well as the huge intangible loss to society and culture, is certainly no less than the tangible impact on industry, commerce, and agriculture. While relief for industry, commerce, and agriculture is extremely important, isn't relief for education even more urgent?</p>
<p>We believe that to provide relief for education in the war zones, first, more education experts must be selected as members of the Rehabilitation Committee so that they can develop comprehensive relief and further improvement plans. Second, schools in the war zones should be vigorously restored, and should never be closed due to economic difficulties or other reasons. We really cannot agree with the current suspension of Labor University. Furthermore, relief for education in the war zones should particularly focus on secondary and primary schools. Most secondary and primary school students are children from the local war zones. When schools are closed, their studies are completely abandoned. And because of the ravages of war, many families are bankrupt and unable to continue their children's education. Therefore, the relief effort should consider the circumstances, restore the original schools, and subsidize children who are unable to attend school, exempting them from all fees. This is a responsibility that the country should bear and should not be regarded as too difficult to undertake and therefore ignored.</p>
<p>In short, the revival of the war zones cannot be delayed. In the past, when Tokyo was struck by an earthquake, the disaster was extremely severe. But they concentrated all their efforts and fought against nature. In just a few years, they achieved recovery. If our country today cannot revive these war zones, which have been destroyed by the weapons of a powerful neighbor, it would be a great shame. We should use this as a starting point for national recovery, nurturing, and education.</p>
<p>In addition, we believe that this resistance against Japan is of great significance, and the devastation suffered by the war zones, witnessed firsthand, should leave an extremely profound impression on us, arousing the spirit of our nation to strive for self-reliance. Therefore, we hope that schools near Shanghai will lead students to visit and give them the most immediate and factual stimulation. We further suggest that a place destroyed by artillery fire be permanently preserved in the war zone, preserving its original state of devastation, to forever commemorate the heroic spirit of this resistance against Japan, and to allow the people of the country to be constantly reminded and warned.</p>

<h3>The Sino-Russian Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Issue</h3>
<p>The representative delegation stationed in Russia attempted one round of talks</p>
<p>The government wired Yan Huiqing to solicit opinions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of resuming diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Central Political Council decided on two principles and two steps and handed it over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for careful handling. Members of the representative delegation stationed in Russia and cadres of the Russian Foreign Affairs Committee had one unofficial round of talks. The Russian side did not seem as eager as before for immediate trade and the dispatch of ambassadors, saying that the diplomatic relations between China and Russia in Xinjiang and the three northeastern provinces had never been interrupted. Also, in the ports of the Yangtze River, Russian goods were gradually being handled by merchants from other countries. The Chinese side sincerely hoped that the Chinese and Russian governments would restore diplomatic relations, and the Russian side was also willing to talk, but hoped that Mo Dehui would return to Russia or that other senior officials would be sent to preside over the talks. Their tone seemed to imply that the powers of the members of the representative delegation were somewhat limited, so no deeper discussions have been held. The government, on the one hand, received reports that Japan and Russia were secretly in contact, and on the other hand, feared that Europe and the United States would make wild speculations about the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. Therefore, it wired Yan Huiqing, the representative in Geneva, asking for his personal opinion on this issue and how it would affect international relations, hoping for a detailed reply. It is expected that Yan's reply will arrive within a few days. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<h3>Gu Weijun Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Flying South from Jinan on a Ford Plane</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Hosts a Dinner to Welcome Him</p>
<p>Gu Plans to Invite the Press for a Talk</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun arrived in Nanjing by plane at 1:00 PM on the 12th. Those who welcomed him at the airport included Representative Wang Jingwei, Chu Minyi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Mo, and Shen Jinding, Director of the Asian Department. Chu took a photo of Gu in front of the plane. Wang prepared a dinner at his official residence to welcome Gu. Those who accompanied him at the dinner included Chen Gongbo, Gu Mengyu, Chen Shaokuan, Zhu Jiahua, and Chen Yi. During the dinner, Gu described in detail his experiences leaving the customs, with many emotional remarks. The dinner ended at 3:00 PM. Wang asked Gu to have another long talk on the 13th. At around 4:00 PM, Xu Mo visited Gu at the Lishi Society for an extensive conversation. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu told reporters that his feelings and impressions during this trip had been expressed in talks in Beidaihe, Tianjin, and other places. He believed that the people of the country would remember them. There were still some things that had not been said, and he planned to invite the press again for a report in the next few days. Currently, the work of the investigation team is not yet fully completed. The period of stay in Beiping is scheduled for two weeks, first to organize the materials obtained from the investigation in Northeast China, and then to travel to Japan for further investigation. The final report of the investigation team will not be started until it returns to China from Japan. The impression of this trip is that the Northeast issue is becoming more and more important. Without going to the Northeast, one does not know the greatness of the Northeast; without going to the Northeast, one does not know the seriousness of the Northeast issue. The experiences of accompanying the investigation team, drafted into a memorandum of twelve articles, have been sent to the League of Nations by the leader of the team. This trip to Nanjing is entirely to report on the experiences of the trip to the East, and he plans to go to Wuhan in the next few days to visit Commander Chiang Kai-shek and report everything. Foreign Minister Luo has gone to Shanghai on official business, and may return soon. He also plans to go to Shanghai. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Ford plane that Zhang Xueliang sent to Jinan yesterday had a wheel damaged during landing. Gu telegraphed Beiping and asked for another one. This morning at 10:11, Ford plane number 432 arrived in Jinan and landed in Zhangzhuang. Gu, along with You Mijian, Shi Zhaoji, and Liu Chongjie, arrived at 9:20 AM at the Jiaoji Hotel to wait. Han sent Zhang Honglie as a representative to welcome them. At 10:30, Gu and the other three boarded the plane and flew south, and they would arrive in Beijing at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. (Special dispatch on the 12th) (Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's Ford plane flew to Jinan this morning to prepare for Gu to fly to Beijing. Gu will stay in Beijing for four or five days and then return to Beiping on the same plane. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun arrived in Beijing this afternoon and immediately went to see President Wang. According to Gu, this trip was specifically to report the results of the Northeast investigation to the government. He will then go to Wuhan to personally report to Military Commissioner Chiang Kai-shek. If time permits, he also plans to go to Shanghai. As for the place where the League of Nations investigation team will compile the report, it has not yet been decided, and the claim that Qingdao has been selected is not accurate. He will go to France and Japan, and everything will be subject to the orders of the government. (Reuters dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<p>Uchida Strongly Advocates Recognizing the Puppet State</p>
<p>Immediately Presented this Opinion to Saito After Arriving in Tokyo</p>
<p>The Japanese Military Department Agrees with Uchida's Diplomatic Expression</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Uchida, the president of the South Manchuria Railway, when meeting with Prime Minister Saito, suggested immediately recognizing Manchukuo and said that the government should quickly prepare under this policy. He also stated his views on the four-headed politics. The Prime Minister seemed to fully agree with Baron Uchida's views. (Dentsu dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Uchida, the president of the South Manchuria Railway, arrived at Tokyo Station at 9:00 AM on the 12th and immediately went to the Prime Minister's official residence to meet with Prime Minister Saito. During the meeting, Prime Minister Saito earnestly requested Baron Uchida to assume the post of Foreign Minister. Baron Uchida said that he would consider it carefully before replying. However, it seems that Baron Uchida's assumption of the post of Foreign Minister is certain. As for the need to delay his response for two or three days, it is necessary to consider the relationship with the parliament and the issue of his successor as president. After meeting with the Prime Minister, Baron Uchida said that he had described the Manchuria issue in detail to Prime Minister Saito and conveyed Xie Jieshi's hopes. The Japanese in Manchuria all hope to immediately recognize "Manchukuo". Prime Minister Saito seemed to be giving it full consideration. (Dentsu dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After meeting with Baron Uchida, Prime Minister Saito immediately summoned Minister of the Army Araki to the Prime Minister's official residence and asked him about the following two major issues: (1) the issue of recognizing Manchukuo and (2) the unification of the four-headed politics: First, the issue has entered a period where it needs to be resolved urgently. What are the opinions of the army? Second, we plan to invite Baron Uchida to assume the post of Foreign Minister. What are the opinions of the military department? Third, who does the military department hope to recommend as the successor to the president of the South Manchuria Railway? Araki replied to the above questions, stating that these two major issues would be answered after meeting with Baron Uchida. As for Baron Uchida's assumption of the post of Foreign Minister, the military department does not like to change the president of the South Manchuria Railway during each political change. If Uchida's assumption of the post of Foreign Minister can establish a nationwide Japanese policy towards Manchuria, there will be no objection. (Dentsu dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Baron Uchida Yasuya, president of the South Manchuria Railway, arrived safely at Tokyo Station at 8:30 AM today on a special express train and immediately met with Prime Minister Saito. The Prime Minister strongly urged him to assume the post of Foreign Minister, and Baron Uchida immediately agreed. The official appointment ceremony will be held around the 13th due to palace-related matters. (Dentsu dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Guangdong Naval Incident</p>
<h3>Mediation Has Ended in Failure</h3>
<p>Ma Chaojun Returns to Shanghai to Report</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Ma Chaojun's mediation of the naval incident, after Chen Jitang and various committee members replied, said that the naval change of affiliation was a resolution of the Ministry's political conference. Chen Ce was also a member and should respect the government's orders. Now that Chen openly resists the order and calls up troops, it is difficult to tolerate. If the Shanghai Committee has affection for Chen Ce, it should persuade him to obey the change of affiliation, and then the government will still give him a way to reform himself. Ma, with ineffective mediation, returned to Hong Kong on the 12th and then transferred to Shanghai to report. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<p>(Zhenjiang) Gu Zhutong, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and all committee members have resigned to the central government due to financial difficulties and the impossibility of maintaining operations. The resignation letters have been sent to the Executive Yuan. A reporter met with a committee member, who said, "We came to do things, not to be officials. There is no financial solution, and there is nothing to do. If there is nothing to do, then why occupy a position and do nothing?" Therefore, after earnest discussions with Gu and other committee members, they decided to resign en masse. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<p>After the Shanghai War</p>
<h3>Jinghu Telegraph Bureau Losses</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Shanghai war, the losses of the Jinghu Telegraph Bureau are shocking. Those in charge say that the usual operating income of this telegraph bureau is about 300,000 per month, with military telegrams accounting for 50 percent (charged at half price) and commercial and news telegrams accounting for 50 percent. Since the Shanghai Incident, just in terms of Jinghu wired telegrams alone, monthly losses have reached more than 100,000. Commercial telegrams have stopped, and half-price official telegrams have instead increased. The Central Party Headquarters' monthly telegram fees have reached more than 100,000, even at half price, and cannot be fully received. After the national crisis, the central government implemented austerity measures, and the half-price official telegrams of various agencies were ordered to be halved again, charged at a quarter of the price. As a result, income has decreased even more. It is estimated that commercial telegram stoppages and losses during this period total more than 300,000. In addition, the main trunk lines along the way have been damaged, plus a batch of unnecessary repair costs, so the amount of losses is also quite high. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<h3>British and French Prime Ministers Exchange Opinions</h3>
<p>MacDonald Arrives in Paris with Simon</p>
<p>Delegates from Both Countries Meet at the French Foreign Ministry</p>
<p>To Discuss the Lausanne Conference</p>
<p>Communiqué States Agreement on Opinions</p>
<p>Paris, 11th (Reuters) - British Prime Minister MacDonald, accompanied by Foreign Secretary Simon, arrived in Paris today. French Premier Herriot personally welcomed them at the train platform. They spoke cordially. MacDonald said in English, "I am delighted to meet you again." Herriot replied in French, "Me too." After the two prime ministers walked arm in arm out of the platform, MacDonald drove to the British Embassy with his daughter. The scene was crowded with onlookers inside and outside the station. As the two prime ministers passed by, everyone shouted "Long live Herriot! Long live MacDonald!" Herriot will host a banquet for MacDonald tomorrow, but the location remains a secret. Herriot discussed everything with the French delegation to the Lausanne Conference this morning and then met with the American Deputy Ambassador, the Soviet Ambassador, and the Japanese Ambassador.</p>
<h3>Herriot Welcomes at the Train Station</h3>
<p>Paris, 11th (Havas) - The British Prime Minister arrived here today. Before the Calais express arrived at the Gare du Nord at 5 PM, diplomatic figures had gathered on the platform. Police were assigned duties. Film companies set up camera boxes in preparation for filming. Passengers entering the city by train from the suburbs of Paris were diverted to other exits. The Minister of Public Works, Dala, etc., arrived at the station at 5:15 PM. Herriot, wearing formal attire and a top hat, followed closely behind. At 5:40 PM, the express train entered the station, stopping a short distance from where the welcoming party was standing. MacDonald was in the second carriage. Journalists swarmed forward. At that time, MacDonald was standing outside the carriage door, wearing a gray tweed sports suit, a soft hat, and glasses. Herriot rushed forward and greeted him in English. MacDonald smiled and welcomed him, saying that he had not seen him for a long time since the finance conference, and was extremely pleased to meet again. MacDonald then ordered his daughter, Isabel, to greet Herriot. They then walked out of the station together. Along the way, journalists and film companies competed to ignite magnesium flares to capture footage. At the station entrance, MacDonald, his daughter, and Herriot rode in the same car, while Foreign Secretary Simon rode with the British Ambassador. The crowd cheered enthusiastically as they left the station.</p>
<h3>The Two Prime Ministers Ride to the Foreign Ministry Together</h3>
<p>Paris, 11th (National News Agency) - British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon arrived safely in Paris this evening from London. French Premier Herriot and several other cabinet members welcomed them at the station. Many French people were present at the station to welcome them. After MacDonald and others got out of the car, they rode in the same car with Herriot to the French Foreign Ministry. They held a long discussion at the Foreign Ministry. At 8 PM, Herriot hosted a dinner. The matters discussed today were none other than the Lausanne Conference, which will open soon. It is expected that discussions will continue tomorrow. It is also heard that MacDonald and others have scheduled to leave France for Geneva on Sunday.</p>
<h3>Communiqué Released After Talks</h3>
<p>Paris, 12th (Reuters) - The British and French Prime Ministers and the British and French Finance Ministers met from 10 AM to 1:30 PM this morning. Afterwards, the following communiqué was released: The friendly, informal talks indicated agreement on opinions between both sides, predicting that the Lausanne Conference could achieve a just and effective solution, thereby solidifying international peace and maintaining trust. The length of today's meeting and the optimistic tone of the communiqué indicate a thorough study of various issues before the reparations conference, with the expectation of achieving practical results.</p>
<h3>Herriot Says There Will Be Satisfactory Results</h3>
<p>Paris, 12th (Havas) - Although Herriot was unwilling to issue any political statement after the meeting between the British and French leaders, he said that the results of the consultations were very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Discusses Key Points of Talks</h3>
<p>London, 11th (Reuters) - The French Cabinet met yesterday to discuss the key points that Herriot needs to raise in the British-French talks. According to the British newspaper's Paris dispatch, Herriot stated that there are no major differences between the British and French positions.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister and Others Stay at the British Embassy</h3>
<p>The British Prime Minister and others will stay at the British Embassy while in Paris. When they will go to Switzerland has not yet been definitively decided. It is expected that they will go to Geneva first early next week, and then to Lausanne. Other British representatives such as Samuel Chamberlain and Rentsiman are scheduled to depart from London on Tuesday to participate in the Lausanne Conference, which will open on Thursday.</p>
<h3>The United States Does Not Want to Participate in the Lausanne Conference</h3>
<p>The Times reports that the US government does not currently want to participate in the Lausanne Conference. Although the reasons are disappointing, they are irreversible.</p>
<h3>Legal Plan to Cancel Debts</h3>
<p>The most important event for the British and French governments at tomorrow's meeting in Paris is to obtain a legal plan to cancel the debts of European governments. These debts are currently not being paid. If Britain and France adopt a broader perspective, there is a greater chance of resolving this matter. Although complete and immediate cancellation may not be feasible in practice, and many consider it morally and commercially impermissible, few people in Britain want Germany to repay its debt to Britain. Therefore, the British Prime Minister can be in a position to proceed naturally to facilitate the procedure of eventually cancelling the debt.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Speculate on the Prospects of the Lausanne Conference</h3>
<p>London, 12th (Reuters) - Today, all British newspapers are paying close attention to news about the Lausanne Conference. They all believe that the hopes for the Lausanne Conference, after being dim for a long time, have suddenly become clear. This is because France may finally accept the British proposal that if the concessions made by the United States can be offset by European concessions, then the policy of completely canceling reparations and war debts can be adopted.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Intends to Reconcile American and French Views</h3>
<p>It is heard that the British Prime Minister intends to reconcile American and French views and will propose a further suspension of reparations and war debts for six months, while Germany will hand over its railway stocks to creditors as the final settlement of its reparations and debts. It is expected that the new German government will have no choice but to comply with the scope for the sake of a practical solution. However, the French government's position is said to be quite dangerous because Finance Minister Martin and Budget Minister Balmarte have stated that if the government does not adopt their procedures, they will resign. One of the proposed procedures is to actively reduce public spending, with a uniform reduction in salaries, which civil servants are currently opposing.</p>
<h3>Italian Chief Delegate Replaced by Grandi</h3>
<p>Rome, 11th (Reuters) - The Italian government originally intended to send Finance Minister Moscaoni as the Italian Chief Delegate to participate in the Lausanne Conference. Today, the Italian Cabinet made an unexpected decision, replacing him with Foreign Minister Grandi as the leader of the Italian delegation. This is the result of British Prime Minister MacDonald's intention to expand the scope of the Lausanne reparations conference. The British Prime Minister and the Italian Foreign Minister will meet on Sunday to compare the points of agreement between the British and Italian procedures.</p>
<p>Reparations Dilemma</p>
<h3>To Be Decided at the Lausanne Conference</h3>
<p>Germany Resolved to Declare That It Has Paid as Much Reparations as Possible</p>
<p>Vast Discrepancies in Estimating Total Reparations Paid</p>
<p>The Issue of Suspending Payments Will Be the Focus of Dispute</p>
<p>Paris, 11th (National News Agency) - It has been thirteen and a half years since the end of the European War, and Germany has now resolved to say that it has paid enough reparations. France and Belgium, however, insist that the amount paid is still insufficient. Other former Allied countries support France and Belgium's view with a semi-sympathetic attitude. These two opposing claims will be judged at the Lausanne Conference, which will open on the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>Nine Countries Are Creditors</h3>
<p>Of the ten countries gathering in Lausanne, nine are creditors: France, Britain, Italy, Belgium, Romania, Portugal, Japan, and Greece. Germany alone is the debtor, like a defendant in court. Although the United States is not formally participating, it is the recipient of a large portion of the reparations received from Germany by various countries, and will naturally pay close attention. France now insists that it has spent a total of 1,755 billion francs on compensating for losses since the European War, which, including interest, amounts to approximately 2,500 billion francs at the current value of the French franc. However, if the German calculations are correct, the amount of reparations paid by Germany is nearly 5,000 billion francs, of which 54% went to France.</p>
<h3>Total Reparations Paid</h3>
<p>However, the total amount of reparations paid varies greatly according to the investigations by the German government, the former Allied governments, and the American Economic Association. The amount paid since the Dawes Plan can be verified by accounts and naturally does not have much discrepancy. However, the calculations for the period from the armistice to the implementation of the Dawes Plan in 1924 differ greatly. According to the official recognition of the Allied countries, approximately 800 billion marks were paid from the armistice to 1922. This is the number released by the Allied Reparations Committee. However, the German calculation reaches 5,600 billion marks. The American Economic Association estimates nearly 2,600 billion marks. Since 1922, during the occupation of the Ruhr region, France has acknowledged taking 175 million marks from the Germans, while Germany insists that it was much more than this. This is the total amount of reparations paid by Germany until the Hoover Moratorium.</p>
<h3>Three Greatly Divergent Calculations</h3>
<p>There are now three greatly divergent calculations: (1) German side: 412.089 million francs, (2) American side: 231.385 million francs, (3) Allied side: 124.150 million francs. However, the fact that France's war zone losses and interest totaled 2,500 billion francs, and that France obtained more than half of the reparations paid by Germany, is certain.</p>
<h3>One Side Must Compromise</h3>
<p>Therefore, in this Lausanne Conference, someone must compromise. Unless the United States agrees to reduce war debts so that reparations can be reduced in the same way, the Allied countries must recognize the fact that Germany's finances are on the verge of bankruptcy. Otherwise, Germany will be forced to continue paying in ways that are beyond its capabilities. In short, it is rare for international conferences to open with such a dark future, such contradictory accounts, and such weak hopes for success.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Suspending Payments</h3>
<p>As for the issue of suspending payments after the opening of the conference, it will be the focus of heated debate. Among the nine countries, including France and Belgium, the issue of suspending payments must first be resolved before a permanent and practical solution to the reparations issue can be discussed.</p>
<h3>Six Possible Solutions</h3>
<p>Now that the Hoover Moratorium is about to expire on July 1st, there is an urgent need to agree on one of the following solutions: (1) Extend the Hoover Moratorium, (2) Suspend payments for two years according to the Young Plan, (3) France suspends payments to the United States for three years, (4) Britain suspends payments to the United States for two years, (5) Britain's previous proposal to suspend payments for five or ten years, (6) Abandon the Young Plan to create a new plan.</p>
<h3>All Will Be Opposed by Germany</h3>
<p>However, Germany will do its best to oppose these suspension plans. The Germans have made it clear that they oppose any plan that only defers payments and requires future repayment. Currently, France and Belgium advocate suspending payments. What they call temporary suspension is nothing more than deferring payments, with the expectation that they will still need to be repaid in the future.</p>
<h3>Germany, Britain, and Italy Advocate a Permanent Solution</h3>
<p>Germany, Britain, and Italy advocate abandoning the concept of temporary suspension and pursuing a permanent solution. Japan may also share this view. However, to abandon the concept of temporary suspension, the United States must make a statement to cancel war debts, or at least agree to reduce war debts.</p>
<p>Spanish Government</p>
<h3>Confiscates Former King's Property</h3>
<p>Madrid, 11th (National News Agency) - The Spanish Cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss the disposal of the former King's property. As a result, it was decided that all of the former King's personal property would be auctioned. Part of the private property of the deposed King Alfonso will also be sold. A large palace garden will be divided and sold to farmers at low prices. The Spanish government has decided to issue an order in advance for the convenience of handling this matter, confiscating all of the former King's movable and immovable property. The deposed King's deposits in various Spanish banks will also be confiscated, and the proceeds will go to the Spanish treasury. All the former palace's utensils, cars, etc., will be auctioned off this month.</p>

<p>New Jersey Police Department, USA</p>
<h3>Investigates Suspects in Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Trenton, New Jersey, 11th (National News Agency) - The driver, Bailin, who is suspected of being the latest suspect in the Lindbergh kidnapping case, has been brought here from New Rochelle for interrogation today. The police department is currently investigating Bailin's actions after the Lindbergh baby was kidnapped, and on that night. It is heard that Bailin resigned from his job on March 1st. The police have thoroughly checked the banknotes recently used by Bailin, but have not found the serial numbers of the 50,000 yuan banknotes paid as ransom by Condentts. After a day of investigation, the police department claimed that it has now learned from Bailin's former employer, Moody, that on the night the Lindbergh baby was kidnapped, a woman, Xia Pu, went out with a person named Miller, and not with Bailin. At that time, both were employed by Mu. Miller has told the authorities about the situation where he and Xia Pu were together that night. The authorities are now very confused, because Xia Pu did confess that she was with Bailin before committing suicide. The authorities are still detaining Bailin, saying that his words are not credible.</p>
<h3>British Detective Visits Ms. Xia Pu</h3>
<p>London, 12th (Reuters) - At the request of the New Jersey police in the United States, the British police department has sent a detective to Berkshire today to visit Ms. Xia Pu to inquire about everything. As a result, the detective believes that Ms. Xia Pu is not related to the Lindbergh kidnapping case. According to reports, Ms. Xia Pu is the sister of the deceased maid of Mrs. Morov's family. She departed from the United States to England four days after Dr. Kangdeng paid a ransom of 50,000 yuan to the contact person of the kidnapper.</p>
<h3>Two Suspects Have No Relationship</h3>
<p>New York, 11th (Reuters) - After the maid of Lindbergh's wife and mother, Mrs. Morrow, committed suicide by poisoning, the police detained two people suspected of being related to the kidnapping case. However, according to today's confirmation, these two people have no relationship. One is Bailin, whom Dr. Kangdeng initially identified as the person who paid the ransom when he saw the photo. However, after Bailin was arrested, Kangdeng suddenly said that he had never seen this person and could not identify him. At the same time, Bailin also presented evidence to prove that on the night the Lindbergh baby was kidnapped, he and his wife stayed in Connecticut. One is Pengster, who is the lover of the suicidal maid. However, after repeated investigations by the police, he is also not related to the kidnapping case.</p>
<h3>Police Officers Fall into Confusion Again</h3>
<p>New York, 12th (Reuters) - Since Dr. Kangdeng could not recognize Bailin, the police authorities have fallen into a state of confusion again regarding the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. It is now known that on the night the Lindbergh baby was kidnapped, Ms. Xia Pu did not ride in the same car with Bailin, but with someone with the same surname as Bai.</p>

<h3>Decides to Establish a Financing Guarantee Company</h3>

<h3>Self-Defense Army</h3>
<h3>Yang's Troops Attack Acheng Again</h3>
<p>Fierce battle with Japanese troops on the 6th</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Defends Tongbei</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence - After 3:00 PM on the 6th, the Self-Defense Army unit led by Yang Zibin engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese Nakamura Brigade and the puppet Jilin army near Acheng. Four Japanese aircraft flew in at 4:00 PM to drop bombs. The battle is still ongoing. It is learned that the Self-Defense Army unit led by Yang Zibin consists of three regiments in total, including one cavalry regiment, one artillery regiment, and one infantry regiment. They first joined forces with Ma Xianzhang's army to attack Acheng on the morning of the 29th of last month, and once recovered it. However, on June 3rd, they retreated due to a counterattack by the Japanese Nakamura Brigade. On the night of the 4th, Ma Xianzhang's troops cut the telephone and telegraph lines between Fuyu and Shuangcheng, and there was news of an attack on Yushu. Yang Zibin's troops retreated along the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) Harbin-Suifenhe line to Mulin Station, and incidentally attacked Maoershan Station, confiscating some firearms from the puppet Jilin army. Afterwards, they retreated into the mountains to reorganize and gather nearby Self-Defense Army units. They then advanced to Ercengjianzi on the morning of the 6th, using one regiment to flank Acheng and two regiments to attack from the front. One large unit of Japanese troops and approximately 2,000 puppet Jilin soldiers in Acheng came out to meet them outside the city at 3:00 PM. For operational convenience, the Japanese troops immediately set fire to the civilian houses outside the city, claiming it would reduce the Self-Defense Army's cover. As a result, many farmers lost their homes and had nowhere to settle, so they brought their old and young to Harbin to seek refuge. The number is extremely large. Eastbound passenger and freight trains on the CER have been suspended accordingly, and traffic on the Harbin-Suifenhe line has been completely cut off. The Russian director of the CER Railway Bureau specifically stated that he would not operate trains on the Harbin-Suifenhe line without adequate protection, in order to avoid endangering the lives of passengers. It is reported that Japanese troops are stationed in Mianpo, Wugimihe, and Hailin along the Harbin-Suifenhe line. Wugimi, Weishahe, and Hengdaohezi in the eastern section are guarded by the Self-Defense Army and National Salvation Army, who do not disturb local merchants at all, and merchants are able to conduct business peacefully. Approximately two brigades of Japanese troops are stationed on the Harbin-Suifenhe line, but they can do nothing about the Self-Defense Army. As the Self-Defense Army attacked Acheng, Xing Zhanqing also led more than 10,000 "Big Sword Society" members to Liaoshunzi (approximately 60 li from Harbin) east of Harbin to support Yang's army. The military situation on this front may become more intense. The military situation on the Hulan-Hailun route has come to an end. On the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese Hiraga Brigade, along with six aircraft, launched a fierce attack on Wu Songlin's brigade of the Heilongjiang army in Nihe. Wu's brigade was entirely cavalry, and the horses were bombed and scattered, leading to defeat. The artillery of Shi Lanbin's unit was weak and unable to resist the Japanese army's superior forces, so they also retreated. After the Japanese troops built a pontoon bridge and crossed the Nihe River, they arrived in Hailun at noon. Ma Zhanshan, who was in Tongbei, immediately gathered forces in that area and dug trenches between Beianzhen and Tongbei. At the same time, Heilongjiang troops from various places also concentrated in that direction. Infantry, cavalry, and the "Big Sword</p>
<p>Society" gathered together, numbering more than 10,000 people, and built solid trenches to prepare for a long-term defense. Cai Hongyou and Li Tiande's units, numbering approximately 3,000 people, recently moved from Wangkui and Qingcheng to the Fifth Station south of Wangkui, intending to launch a flanking attack and raid the Japanese base in Suihua. The Japanese army has dug trenches in that area for defense and has opened airfields in Hulan and Suihua. Airplanes are sent to Wangkui and Tongbei daily for reconnaissance. According to those who have returned, there are many righteous army infantrymen in the Baiquan area, and they are currently being transported to Tongbei. Li Haiqing's army, which is cooperating with Ma Zhanshan's army, was forced to retreat by the Japanese army on the 3rd.</p>
<p>to Anda, taking advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness in Hongjiadian south of Anda, surrounding and attacking fiercely, annihilating more than 200 enemies and capturing many military supplies. Japanese aircraft flew to bomb, and the Hiramatsu Regiment was dispatched early on the 4th to rescue the remnants, taking the opportunity to occupy Anda County. Li's army then retreated to Huojiaji, intending to move to Wangkui to approach Hailun and join forces with Ma Zhanshan's army. On the morning of the 5th, Japanese aircraft flew to Huojiaji to drop bombs. Li's army lay on the ground and used rifles to counterattack. They retreated leisurely on the afternoon of the 5th. On the afternoon of the 6th, it was reported that they had arrived north of Hailun. (6th)</p>

<h3>Talks on Bitterly Defending Yuguan</h3>
<p>Soldiers find unparalleled joy in killing foreign enemies</p>
<p>The Battle of Shanghai is an external illness, Yuguan is consumption.</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence - He Zhuguo, the Ninth Brigade Commander stationed at Shanhaiguan, came to Beiping with the investigation team some days ago. The reporter visited him yesterday and recorded his conversation as follows: (Reporter asked) What attitude should your brigade take in defending Shanhaiguan in the future? (He replied) It is a soldier's duty to defend the country. Moreover, fighting against foreign countries is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a true soldier. They should find unparalleled joy in killing the enemy. The Japanese Tianjin Garrison Army is located in the south of my brigade's defense, the South Sea and the west road, Taihuangdao, and the Japanese Kwantung Army is located outside the Guan. This is what is called being attacked from all sides. In my personal opinion, when the situation in Yuguan became tense after the 15th of last month, I made all preparations. After thinking it over, I should obey two principles: (1) Soldiers obey the orders of the highest commander, and (2) a few people consider the safety of the majority. If a war breaks out, North China will be shaken. If preparations are not complete, the impact will be even greater. Moreover, since I have not received orders from above, I can only endure humiliation and bear the heavy burden. However, I must defend every inch of the country's territory to the death and dare not fail to fulfill my mission. (Asked) What are the brigade commander's thoughts on the 19th Route Army? (Answer) The 19th Route Army fought bravely against the Japanese and promoted the spirit of the nation. I admire them immeasurably. However, the two months of fighting by the 19th Route Army was like suffering from an external illness. Once the acute phase passes, the illness will disappear. My brigade has been bitterly defending Shanhaiguan for nine months, and it is like suffering from consumption. We are still struggling and suffering. (Asked) The brigade commander's loyalty and courage in defending Yuguan are admirable. Who does the brigade commander intend to compare himself to in ancient times to repay the country? (Answer) Since ancient times, generals who have led troops to defend the border have had only two options: peace and war. The situation I am in is neither war nor peace. There has never been such a difficult situation since ancient times. If the arrangements are not careful, the Japanese army may be able to use it as an excuse. Wouldn't it be like a free city outside Shanghai and another free pass in the north? Now I can only defend the territory and repay the country. Who am I to compare myself to famous generals of ancient times? (Asked) The brigade commander came to Beiping with the investigation team. Did you hear any thoughts on the Manchurian state from Lord Lytton? (Answer) Although I did not hear it from Lord Lytton's mouth, the people around the investigation team all felt that "when they first arrived in Manchuria, they thought the Manchurian state had a foundation. When they arrived in Harbin and heard the sound of cannons and the activities of the Volunteer Army, they realized that the Manchurian state was very dangerous and that the foundation of its construction was only on the railway." He also said that I only know</p>
<p>to obey orders to defend the country's territory, and do everything in practice, without relying on propaganda. Propaganda must focus on reality. Excessive propaganda may inadvertently lead to disputes. He also said that although I came to Beiping to ask for instructions, the Yuguan army has a chief of staff as my proxy, and we communicate by telephone every day. The situation is currently very good, and I will return to defense the day after tomorrow. (10th)</p>
<p>League of Nations Investigation Team</p>
<h3>A Day's Record of Visiting Qingdao</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence - Lord Lytton, Chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Team, and Mr. Schnee, the German representative, Mr. Codi, the Italian representative, and representatives from China and Japan, as well as many attendants, arrived in Qingdao from Jinan at 9:15 PM tonight (the 9th). The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Preparations in Advance - Mayor Shen Honglie ordered the Marine Corps and the Public Security Bureau to inform their subordinates that they must provide strict protection when the investigation team arrives in Qingdao. Therefore, the Railway Bureau police were responsible for guarding the inside of the station, and the Public Security Bureau secretly deployed posts outside the station and in the city. The area of vigilance was also stipulated. The area east of Chengbao and west of Songgezhuang was guarded by the Marine Corps stationed in the area. Songgezhuang to Cangkou was under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, Cangkou to Sifen was under the jurisdiction of the Fifth Branch, Sifen to Dagang was under the jurisdiction of the Third and Fourth Branches, Dagang to the north end of Zhongshan Road was under the jurisdiction of the Second and Third Branches, and the north end of Zhongshan Road to the station, passing Guangxi, Jiangsu, and Yishui Roads, was under the jurisdiction of the First Branch. The area along the road outside the station was handled by the Second Security Team in conjunction with the First Branch, and the mayor's residence was guarded by the First Security Team.</p>
<p>Arrival in Qingdao - Around 7:00 PM, the Qingdao station inside and outside was guarded by the Railway Police and the Public Security Bureau Police Security Team. Around 8:00 PM, representatives from all walks of life who came to welcome them arrived at the station one after another, totaling approximately 200 people. Shen Honglie and important figures from the navy also</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>arrived at the station. At 8:30 PM, the pilot car arrived first. At 9:15 PM, the special train entered the station. The train had a total of twelve cars, all of which were specially prepared coaches on the Beining Railway. After Lord Lytton and others got off the train, they briefly exchanged greetings with Mayor Shen and consuls from various countries. Then, they tipped their hats to the representatives from all walks of life, and then walked out of the station to take the cars prepared by the city government to the traveling headquarters. Lord Lytton and the German and Italian representatives all stayed at the Yingbin Hotel (i.e., the mayor's residence), while Representative Gu and other attendants stayed at the Wanguo Sanatorium. The Japanese representative, Yoshida, and his attendants stayed at the Grand Hotel.</p>
<p>Tour Itinerary - The team will stay in Qingdao for one day. Before 9:00 AM on the 10th, they will meet with representatives from all walks of life. At 9:00 AM, they will visit Mayor Shen at the city government. Then, they will go to Huiquan Bathing Beach, First Park, Battery, and other places for sightseeing. At 12:00 PM, they will return to the mayor's residence for lunch. After a short rest, they will visit the scenic Laoshan. They will have refreshments at Liushutai and return to Qingdao that evening. At 9:00 PM, they will take the original train west to Jinan and then to Taian. On the 11th, they will visit Mount Tai, and on the 12th, they will return to Beiping. (June 10th)</p>
<p>League of Nations Investigation Team</p>
<h3>Passing Through Jinan to Visit Mount Tai</h3>
<p>Report Writing Location to be Determined in Qingdao</p>
<p>Lytton Seems to Tacitly Accept the Japanese Claim</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - The Japanese had made thorough preparations in advance for Lord Lytton and others to come to Qingdao this time. A Japanese oil merchant in Qingdao named Minemura has an excellent house that had already been drawn up in advance, renovated and brand new. Therefore, as soon as the investigation team arrived in Qingdao, the Japanese representative, Yoshida, led Lord Lytton and others to inspect the house, showed them the drawings, and proposed that if the investigation team wrote the report in Qingdao, then</p>
<p>the house would be their residence. Lord Lytton and others seemed to agree to this proposal. If this becomes a reality, then the investigation team will be completely surrounded by the Japanese in the future. Because Lord Lytton and his party had to rush back to Beiping before noon on the 12th and planned to take time out of their busy schedule to visit Mount Tai, they only stayed in Qingdao for one day and left Qingxi at 6:20 PM on the 10th. Peng Dongyuan, a member of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, took a pilot car in advance. Lord Lytton and others are scheduled to arrive in Jinan at 3:30 AM on the 11th, and then transfer to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. After the locomotive has been loaded with coal and water, it will depart for Taian at 4:00 AM. After arriving in Taian at 7:00 AM, they will climb the mountain to visit scenic spots. They will leave Taian at 5:00 PM and return north, passing through Jinan at 8:00 PM on the evening of the 12th</p>
<p>They are scheduled to arrive in Beiping before noon. A telegram was sent in advance to request the Jinan authorities not to welcome them at the station and not to prepare a military band. Jinan has had continuous hot weather in recent days. At 12:00 midnight on the 10th, there was a sudden thunderstorm, and the streets turned into rivers, one, two, three, or four feet deep. Zhang Honglie, the representative of Han Fuju, Wen Chenglie, the mayor of Jinan, Wang Kairu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and others braved the rain to arrive at the Jiaoji Station to welcome Lord Lytton and others at 3:00 AM on the 11th. Lord Lytton's special train arrived at the Jinan Station at 4:15 AM due to delays en route. By then, the rain had stopped and the sky had cleared, and the golden rooster crowed. At 4:55 AM, they left Jinan and departed for Taian. Zhang Honglie traveled south with the train to host them. It is reported that the team is still scheduled to leave Taibei at 5:00 PM. (11th)</p>
<p>Japanese Young Officer Corps</p>
<h3>Plotting to Assassinate Saitō Again</h3>
<p>Cut Throat Letter Sent by Mail</p>
<p>Government and Councilors in Panic</p>
<p>Tokyo Mancho Newspaper reported that the severity of the guard inside and outside the Diet since the Diet opened has been unprecedented. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 AM on the second day, a confidential letter was suddenly sent by post to influential members of the House of Peers. The letter contained a "Cut Throat Letter to assassinate Prime Minister Saitō, Internal Minister Makino, and Wakatsuki, the President of the Minseitō," signed by the Young Officer Blood Alliance. When someone finished reading it at the time, he immediately notified all parties, and the government authorities and members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives were greatly panicked. At the same time, the government, based on this letter, secretly ordered a thorough investigation and mutually discussed prudent preventive measures.</p>
<h3>Compilation and Translation of Japanese Telegrams</h3>
<p>Unprecedented News Occurs in the Japanese Judicial World - Tokyo Kokumin Newspaper reported that the Tokyo High Court recently discovered unprecedented news, that is, the same judge issued completely opposite verdicts on the same case on the same day. One verdict stated that the plaintiff won the case, and the other stated that the plaintiff lost the case, confusing both parties as to what to do.</p>
<p>The case was the bankruptcy of Ishii Sadashichi, who borrowed five koku of rice.</p>
<p>The main text and reasons for the verdict, as well as the legal interpretations, were absolutely contradictory. The parties on both sides received this document on the same day, and were all</p>
<p>surprised and at a loss as to what to do. One of the main texts was to cancel the original judgment and send it back to the Tokyo District Court for retrial. The other main text was to reject and not accept the case, that is, the former recognized that the original judgment was inappropriate and belonged to the winner, while the latter recognized that the original trial was proper and became a loser. However, the main text was like this, and the reasons stated in it were also greatly contradictory. (According to the darkness of the Japanese judicial world, how can there be organization?)</p>
<p>Japanese Immigration to Manchuria May Reach 1.5 Million People - Tokyo Kokumin Newspaper reported that the number of Japanese in Harbin suddenly increased by 1,500 in the past two months. Other inspection groups from the mainland, Korea, and South Manchuria continued to arrive in Harbin in an endless stream. All hotels were overcrowded. It is reported that the number of Japanese people who will immigrate to Manchuria in the future is estimated to be around 1.5 million. Therefore, the population of various cities and municipalities in Manchuria is gradually increasing sharply.</p>
<p>Japanese Secretly Supply the Righteous Army with Military Equipment - Tokyo Hochi Newspaper reported that four people, including Takasugi Shinichi, a citizen of Onomichi, secretly supplied the enemy (referring to our country) with military equipment and ammunition during the Sino-Japanese Incident. Kasaara Gunjirō, etc. of Omachi 2-chome, Fukushima City, dispatched them to Osaka on April 26 to secretly transport 100 Belgian-made twelve-shot pistols and 1,000 bullets packed in four wooden boxes, and sent them from the Abu County, Yamaguchi Prefecture Ogi Station. On May 30, Kasahara shipped the car and transported it to the steamship staying in Shinkawako, Ogi Town. Just as he was carrying it, he was suddenly discovered by the Ogi police officer, who brought him to the police station along with the witness. After a thorough investigation, it was revealed that there were accomplices in each port in Osaka and Moji. The authorities attached great importance to this traitorous act.</p>
<p>Europe and the United States Will Continue to Send Personnel to Investigate Manchuria - Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reported from Harbin that, according to information from foreign countries, after the League of Nations Lytton and other investigation committee reports, a meeting will be held to discuss the Manchurian issue and decide to further clarify the actual situation in Manchuria. Several military experts will be dispatched.</p>
<p>Entering Manchuria from Siberia and re-investigating the situation.</p>
<h3>Chiang and He Confer on Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>Climbing Mount Lu Together on the 9th</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence - After Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram to He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Border Areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian, and Xiong Shihui, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, from Nanjing on the 7th, they took a special train on the Nanchang-Jiujiang Road at 7:00 AM on the 8th to Jiujiang to welcome them. According to the telegrams received by the Headquarters and the Provincial Government, Chiang arrived in Jiujiang by ship at 6:00 AM on the 9th. When the ship docked, He and Xiong boarded the ship to pay their respects. After a short rest, Chiang and He Xiong disembarked one after another and went straight to Mount Lu. It is reported that Chiang believes that the Red Peril in the East China Sea is now the most severe in Hubei, while Jiangxi Province is the most extensive bandit area, and Jiangxi Province is also the center of the anti-communist military affairs of the seven southeastern provinces. In addition, since Chen Jitang withdrew a part of the Guangdong army that came to Jiangxi and Fujian to assist in bandit suppression, the original three-province bandit suppression plan must be re-planned. Therefore, Chiang went to Mount Lu with He and Xiong for a short stay in order to solve the above problems. It is reported that He also brought the three-province bandit suppression plan and report book when he went to Jiujiang to present to Chiang for approval. Chiang must decide on the bandit suppression plans for Jiangxi and other provinces in Mount Lu before going to Wuhan. Therefore, the date of departure for Jiujiang is still unknown. (10th)</p>
<p>Western Anhui</p>
<h3>Red Bandits Return to Southern Henan</h3>
<p>The Fourth Division Concentrates on Zhengyang</p>
<p>The Ninth Division Will be Stationed in Bengbu</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence - Because the official army launched a large-scale campaign to suppress them, the old nest of the Red Bandits in western Anhui led by Kuang Jixun was attacked. They have led most of the ferocious bandits to the area of Shangcheng, Guangshan, and Huangchuan in southern Henan. Liu Zhi, the Pacification Director of Kaifeng, also sent Chen Jicheng, Li Sisuo, and other troops to attack Guanghuang. Zhang Fang, the commander-in-chief of the 20th Route Army, also ordered his troops to cooperate with the militia to encircle and suppress the bandits in Shangcheng. The Air Force stationed in Bengbu sent planes carrying bombs to the Huang area for reconnaissance and bombing for days. The bandit forces are declining day by day, and it is hoped that they will be cleared up soon. As for the Red Bandits in Huoqiu, a part of them still remains and has seized wheat in order</p>
<p>to transport it to the bandit area. The bandits have deployed defenses in the Xihu area west of Huoqiu and guard Yulindian. This group is mostly local bandits who have been newly incorporated into the Red Army, known as the Red Guards, and are not purely communists, so they do not have any real strength. The Huoqiu, Yingshang, Zhengyang area militia has a crowd of four or five thousand people. After the fall of Zhengyang, they launched attacks on the bandits repeatedly. From last month to the present, they have fought fiercely with the bandits five times, but they have been unable to eliminate the bandits due to lack of ammunition and uncoordinated command. At present, defenses are deployed above the Huai River, in the Linhuaigang, Tianjiagang, Xindianbu, Zhangtaizi, and Jiangtaizi areas. People from Yingshang said that if there were strong troops to suppress them, the bandits would be easily defeated. It is also very strange that the Song Shike Brigade stationed in Zhengyang did not dare to cross the Lei Pond. The representatives of the five counties of Huoqiu, Fuyang, Yingshang, Shou County, and Fengtai asked for assistance in Beijing, saying that the militia of each county lacked ammunition and their strength was quite insufficient. They requested the Military Affairs Commission to allocate ammunition for the militia for bandit suppression and self-defense. The Military Affairs Commission approved and ordered Xu Tingyao, the commander of the Fourth Division, to allocate 100,000 rounds for the five counties to receive. Huofu Yinghou Feng and five counties have sent representatives to Bengbu to receive and apply for use. The Fourth Division recently received an order from the Military Affairs Commission to go to Zhengyang to search and suppress the Red Bandits and protect farmers in harvesting wheat. Xu Tingyao decided to send six infantry regiments to concentrate on Zhengyang and advance towards Huoqiu. Xu will also go to Zhengyang to command the troops to suppress the bandits. The</p>
<p>The Independent Brigade of the division, led by Guan Linzheng, departed by boat from Bengbu to the west on the afternoon of the 10th. The First Supplementary Regiment stationed in Huaiyuan departed on the morning of the 11th and was stationed in Shou County. The situation in Shoucheng has eased. The 11th Brigade, led by Wang Wanling, is scheduled to depart from Bengbu and head west on the 12th. The 12th Brigade and the officers and soldiers directly under the师司令部各处官兵直属部队各处官兵直属部队 each division headquarters are scheduled to depart Zhengyang on the 13th. The division headquarters will be established there. The division recently received an order to return to the command of Wang Jun, the commander of the Third Army stationed in Hefei. Wang is scheduled to convene a bandit suppression meeting within the day to determine the bandit suppression plan and combat strategy in order to achieve effective command. Xu Tingyao will send personnel to Hefei to participate in the meeting. As the Fourth Division set off to suppress the bandits, the defense of Bengbu will be taken over by Li Yiannian's Ninth Division under the command of Jiang Dingwen, commander of the Second Army. The division is prepared to come to Bengbu. Hu Zongnan's First Division and Tang Yunshan's Independent 33rd Brigade have now arrived in Shucheng and will join forces with Chen Tiaoyuan, Wang Jun, Zeng Wanzhong, and others to attack Liu Huo, corresponding to Xu Tingyao's division and Song Shike Brigade attacking Huoqiu, in order to quell the bandits and secure the border.

<p>Wuhu Correspondence - Small steamers operating between Beijing, the provincial capital Wuhu, and various inland river areas</p>
<p>have been repeatedly robbed midway by bandits. Some days ago, the Wuan merchant ship of the Datong class and the Wuning small steamer of the Jingwu class were robbed one after another, and people were brutally killed. The two cases have no clues. Yesterday, the Kuailong merchant ship of the Yilong Company, which sailed from Wuwu County to Wuhu, carrying more than 200 passengers, suddenly found more than 20 bandits on the ship, each with a pistol, forcing the ship to stop and looting. The passengers' clothes were mostly stripped, with losses of more than 5,000 yuan. After the ship arrived in Wuhu, the robbed passengers believed that the ship seemed to have noticed the presence of bandits beforehand and had moved and hid the tickets and other items, but did not inform the public in order to prepare for it. Therefore, they intend to negotiate with the ship company to investigate.</p>
<p>The Red Bandits of Anhui Province have been accumulating and maintaining themselves until now and have become a major problem. It is heard that the number of bandits and guns in the Liu'an area of western Anhui has reached more than 40,000, which is almost equal to the bandit situation in Fujian and Jiangxi. In southern Anhui, the Huizhou area, there are also often bandits appearing. The business community here recently received a telegram from Wuyuan, saying that County Mayor Ke of the county fought fiercely with the bandits yesterday. Relying on the bravery of the police, many bandits were killed and 11 staff members of the bandit party were captured. The chase is still underway. It can be known that the bandit situation is all over the Anhui territory. (10th)</p>

<h3>War Imminent</h3>
<p>Chen Jitang Orders Army and Air Force to Assemble in Leizhou</p>
<p>Chen Ce Sends Navy to Raid Beihai</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: A month has passed since the Guangdong naval and air forces were reorganized and placed under new command, sparking a disturbance. Numerous attempts at mediation have failed, as both sides have become so polarized that mediation is impossible. The delay in resolving the issue with force is due to the lack of opportune timing. Investigations reveal that the province has completed its military preparations, and the troops dispatched to attack Hainan have arrived in Leizhou in succession, creating a confrontational situation with Hainan. The Hainan navy has consistently opposed the provincial authorities, as evidenced by their slogans in a Hainan newspaper, which vehemently criticized Chen Jitang. This demonstrates their resolute determination. Since concentrating in Hainan, the navy has withheld tax revenues from Hainan's thirteen counties. On the 2nd and 3rd of this month, the navy sent a battalion of marines under Chen Ji, aboard the warship "Flying Eagle," to Lianzhou. Landing at Beihai, they seized all taxes and ordered Beihai merchants to raise 200,000 yuan for military expenses within three days. Chen Jitang, fearing that the marines would occupy Qinlian, has ordered Chen Hanguang's guard brigade stationed in Gaozhou to advance with all speed. The vanguard of Chen's brigade arrived in Leizhou on the 2nd, while the brigade headquarters and the regiment led by Liang Guowu have reached Xuwen, deploying along the Leizhou coast. The Third Independent Regiment, led by Zhang Wentao, arrived on the 4th, and the Fourth Independent Regiment, led by Liu Qishi, will soon depart from Gaozhou southward. The provincial government is mobilizing approximately a brigade and three regiments, totaling over 20,000 troops, for the attack on Hainan. However, Xuwen in Leizhou is about 200 nautical miles from Hainan's port, separated by the Qiongzhou Strait, making a swift crossing difficult. The fleet only possesses a couple of warships, such as the "Haihu," which is insufficient. Therefore, thorough preparations are necessary for the attack. To compensate for the lack of naval vessels, Chen Jitang has procured a large quantity of fir to build rafts for transporting troops across the sea to land. He has also decided to deploy the air force to control the Hainan navy's activities, given their superior combat strength. Chen has ordered Huang Guangrui, the air force commander, to recall a portion of the Fifth Air Force squadron from Shantou and reallocate five new fighter planes from the province, bringing the total to eleven. They are to be deployed to Leizhou, enabling a simultaneous land and air attack. According to a telegram from the Southern District Pacification Headquarters, the Leizhou airfield was completed on the 4th of this month, and the planes for the Hainan campaign will soon be stationed there awaiting orders. On the land front, Chen Jitang has mobilized a division of the Second Army to Gaozhou as a backup, to bolster his forces. Fearing that Hainan's navy might intercept sea transports along the coast, the supplies are being transported by land. Supply depots have been established, with the main depot in Zhaoqing and branch depots in Yangjiang, Maoming, Leicheng, and Xuwen. Military supplies and rations are constantly being transported. On the evening of the 4th, four large cannons and a large quantity of military supplies and ammunition were transported from headquarters to the front for the attack on Hainan. It seems that war on Hainan is imminent. (June 8)</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Arrests a Large Number of Communists: The Public Security Bureau, acting on orders to investigate suspected Communists, dispatched a large number of inspectors, along with personnel from various sub-bureaus and stations, to conduct searches at designated addresses. They arrested carpenter Wang A'bao in the First Sub-Bureau's jurisdiction; Jiang Tieru, Yue Zongfei, and Chen Nannian in the Second Sub-Bureau's jurisdiction; eight Hongsheng Match Factory workers, including Zhang Yonglian, Liu Qiqing, Lao Lianfu, Gao Shunfu, Gao A'fa, Han Renfang, Yang Gongming, and Gu Gengquan, in the Third Sub-Bureau's jurisdiction; Wang Xiao'a'san, a worker from the Sulun Factory; and Lu Mo and Bu Shifan, two teachers from Bantang Primary School. All were taken to the main bureau and then escorted to the Capital Garrison Headquarters for processing.</p>
<p>Notorious Bandit Gu Jiwen and Accomplices Executed: Gu Jiwen, Shen Decai, Xue Song'a, and others, notorious bandits who robbed the 19th Route Army's transportation boat, murdered Deputy Director Wang of the army's transportation department, robbed the Susheng ferry, and plundered wealthy refugees in Wuxi, were captured. After being interrogated by the Songhu Anti-Bandit Command, they were sentenced to death. Yesterday (the 12th), they were escorted by ship to the scene of their crimes and executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>New Education Bureau Director to Take Office: The newly appointed Director of the Education Bureau, Peng Jiazhi, is scheduled to take office on the 15th of this month. He is currently investigating the bureau's financial deficits and seeking ways to raise funds.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Finance Department Enforces the "Yitu" System: During the early Guangxu period of the Qing dynasty, under the leadership of Pei Dazhong, the magistrate of Wuxi, the "Yitu" system was implemented in Wuxi. Land taxes were assigned to a "Jia Zhu" (head of the "Jia"), who was responsible for collecting and remitting the full amount. Over the decades, many "Jia Zhu" were bankrupted or fled due to covering the tax shortfalls. As a result, people were reluctant to take on the role. Recently, the Jiangsu Finance Department, recognizing the increasing difficulty in collecting outstanding land taxes, has formulated rules to rigorously implement the "Yitu" system in all counties. Every village will nominate a wealthy individual to serve as "Jia Zhu" on a rotating annual basis, responsible for collecting the full amount of land taxes. Wuxi and Wujin counties will be the first to implement this system, starting with the winter grain tax this year. The county government has been ordered to comply.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Wounded Soldier Chen Xiaocheng, Who Caused Trouble, Arrested: The joint police and militia inspection office of Wuyi Province arrested Chen Xiaocheng, a discharged soldier who had committed multiple crimes. Investigations revealed that he had forced the Dexing Pawnshop in Xicang Bridge to lend him money using a steel watch as collateral, leading to a conflict with the Western Business Corps. He had also seized firearms from the Public Security Bureau's wooden-shell squad, injured squad members, and robbed the Yong'an Tea House of twenty silver dollars. He was identified by the victims and sent to the county for trial on the evening of the 11th.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Illegal Inspection Office Robs Opium: Numerous opium robberies have occurred along the river in the provincial capital, with five or six incidents in recent days. It is rumored that various agencies are investigating the matter, but none have claimed responsibility. Recently, Wang Hongxun set up an illegal inspection office in Daguanlou and seized opium on two occasions. After being reported to the court, he was summoned by the prosecutor's office, but Wang refused to appear. It is said that the prosecutor's office has issued another summons with a warrant for arrest.</p>
<p>Ministry Orders Abolition of Special Business Tax: The Ministry of Finance of the Executive Yuan has ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Government to abolish the proposed special business tax. It is said that the provincial government claims that only one million yuan is available for provincial expenses this year, which is far from sufficient. Therefore, the special business tax is deemed necessary. The Director of the Finance Department recently met with representatives from Suzhou and Wuxi chambers of commerce, expressing the provincial government's plight and seeking understanding. However, various parties expressed strong opposition and refused to accept the tax. It is said that the majority of cotton and wood subject to the special tax are foreign goods, and collecting the tax may violate the original intent of tariff reduction and tax increases. The Finance Department is reconsidering the proposal and considering replacing the business tax with a business license tax. The tax rate will be divided into three classes and nine grades, with a maximum monthly tax of fifty yuan and a minimum monthly tax of five jiao for businesses with capital under 100,000 yuan. Businesses with capital above 100,000 yuan will be subject to separate regulations. Director Shu of the Finance Department is scheduled to invite executive committee members of the Provincial Federation of Commerce on the 13th to discuss provincial finance and tax issues. According to the executive committee members, the business tax can be assisted within their capacity, based on the principle of cooperation between officials and citizens. However, they will not intervene in the special business tax or the business license tax.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Refused Bandits at the Door, Died by Bullet: When bandits came to the residence of She Wenxun in Yang'er Township, the eighth district of the county, he closed the door to resist. Unable to enter, the bandits fired randomly. A bullet penetrated the wall and entered She's mouth, causing him to collapse. After learning of the incident from nearby villages, they sounded the alarm, causing the bandits to flee. However, She lost too much blood and died on the way to the city for treatment. It is reported that the incident has been reported to the authorities for redress.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Province Orders Joint Survey of Dike Construction by Two Counties: Yan Zuobin of Baoying, who was previously responsible for constructing the southern dike of Baoying, changed the route without authorization and forcibly excavated farmland in Gaoyou, illegally arresting farmers' representatives such as Shen Furong. Farmers led by Liu Tianguan have filed a complaint with the provincial government. It is reported that the Civil Affairs Department has instructed the Gaoyou and Baoying county governments to conduct a joint survey and submit a factual report for review. The Gaoyou county government has dispatched Deng Linzhu, the head of the First Section, to conduct the survey.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Clues Found in Kidnapping Case in Xuejiagang: In Xuejiagang (only ten miles from the city) in Jiaxing County, the homes of Feng Jiande and Feng Zuoqing were robbed and Feng Wu, Feng Zuoqing's granddaughter-in-law, was kidnapped last month. After the incident, the Second District of the Water Police sent detectives to investigate and arrested Yang Wenbiao, a resident of Taiwan, near Sanjiaozhi, a location close to the home, for questioning. However, they released Yang because there was no evidence to link him to the crime, and Yang did not confess to colluding with the bandits. Recently, the district police arrested Pan A'san, a suspect in the case. The victim identified him as one of the robbers. After interrogation, Pan confessed to the robbery and claimed that the kidnapped woman was hidden in Yang Wenbiao's straw hut. As a result, Yang was arrested again and confronted with Pan. Pan told Yang to quickly hand over the kidnapped woman to avoid further suffering, but Yang denied it. Efforts are underway to find the woman so she can be rescued.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Apprentice Embezzles Funds, Commits Suicide by Drowning: Wu Yongquan, a sixteen-year-old apprentice at the tea shop owned by Wang Ziqing in Shangqianbu, Hangzhou, diligently served and gained Wang's trust. He was entrusted with handling money. However, a gambler named Ye Jinbiao, taking advantage of his youth and naivety, lured him into gambling. Wu fell for the scheme and gradually embezzled over 300 yuan from the shop, losing it all. Filled with regret and fearing that Wang would discover his actions, he secretly went to the riverbank the night before and drowned himself. The next morning, his body was found floating in the water.</p>
<p>Wang immediately sent a letter to Wu's father, Ju Huan, to inform him of the situation. After learning the cause of death, he brought Ye Jinbiao to the local Public Security Bureau and notified the Hangzhou District Court to send someone to examine the body. Ye was arrested and detained by the court.</p>

The depot has provided Yan's family with 100 yuan for funeral expenses and sent the driver, soldier Wang Zhen, to the Hangzhou District Court for questioning. Wang claimed that he was unable to brake in time. The court determined that the vehicle belonged to the Ministry of Military Administration, and the driver was a soldier, so the case did not fall under the court's jurisdiction. It was transferred to the Provincial Security Department for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Memorial Service in the Cold Wind and Bitter Rain</h3>
<p>The Spirit of the Martyrs Will Never Die, Yet the Sun Loses Its Light</p>
<p>The Compatriots Sacrifice for the Country, Even Heaven Sheds Tears</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Memorial Service for the Martyrs of the Songhu Resistance and the Compatriots Who Died in the Disaster was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning at ten o'clock amidst a cold wind and bitter rain. Thousands of people attended, filling almost every space in the venue. General Cai Tingkai, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and others personally attended. In addition, Chief Officiant Wang Xiaolai, Central Representative Wang Luyi, and Supervisory Yuan Representative Gao Yihan also attended. The atmosphere was extremely desolate and solemn. All stores in the city flew their flags at half-mast to express their condolences. The details of yesterday's events are recorded below.</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Venue: The venue was the main auditorium inside the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. A sacrificial altar was set up in the center, with the chief officiant's seat in front, followed by the assisting officiant's seat, then the seats for representatives from Party, government, and military agencies, the press, and finally, the prompter's seat and conductor's seat. On both sides were the orchestra and alarm bell. Representatives from various sectors gathered inside the venue. The altar was covered with wreaths presented by Sun Ke, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Tiecheng, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and others, creating a splendid and solemn atmosphere. A horizontal banner above read: "Shanghai Municipal Memorial Service for the Martyrs of the Songhu Resistance and the Compatriots Who Died in the Disaster." The surroundings were filled with elegiac couplets, numbering no fewer than several hundred. Outside the venue, beneath the fluttering flags of the Party and the nation, a banner reading "Shanghai Municipal Memorial Service for the Martyrs of the Songhu Resistance and the Compatriots Who Died in the Disaster" was prominently displayed. Inside the corridor, striking cloth paintings were hung. Red ink blended with raindrops, dripping down like rain or blood.</p>
<p>Guards at the Gate: Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, representatives from various sectors began arriving. The General Police Department dispatched a large contingent of Western and Chinese police officers and detectives to stand guard outside the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and at the Tianhou Palace Bridge, North Henan Road, and North Suzhou Road. They also prohibited vehicles from passing through the section from Shanxi Road Bridge to Henan Road Bridge. Those with suspicious behavior were searched. Inside the gate, boy scouts from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Post Office, and the Moore Memorial Church strictly guarded the entrance, checking identification badges and refusing entry to those without them.</p>
<p>Solemn Elegiac Couplets: There were many elegiac couplets displayed at the venue yesterday, too numerous to list in detail. Among them were those with solemn and tragic wording, such as Zhang Zhizhong's: "Recalling the corpses filling Yunzao, blood dyeing Jiangwan, we are saddened by the sight of the war zone, tears flow down our faces in shame for surviving. Looking afar at the rebels occupying the White Mountains, the enemy invading the Black Water, we grieve for the ruined homeland, we will not share the sky with this enemy." Li Liejun's: "We rely on brave troops to defeat strong enemies, do not report the agreement to the heroic souls." Yu Jishi's: "Blood battles and hand-to-hand combat, but to restore our homeland, they lightly gave up their precious heads. Swallowing our tears, we recall the devastation by the Party, how can we bear to go to the depths of the underworld with such deep hatred?" Sun Ke's: "Evil forces spread, seawater flies horizontally, a strange disaster strikes early in the morning. Seeing the deep wounds suffered by Liaoshen and Songhu, we know that Han traitors cannot coexist with the righteous. Upholding justice and protecting our golden territory, we bravely defend what is right. Tracing back to Suiyang and Wu Mu defending the nation, in the underworld, we can all share the same hatred." Lin Jin's: "Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusongzhen, all reduced to scorched earth, the cuckoo cries out the blood of the nation. Washington, Hague, and Locarno, just a few scraps of paper, the crowing of a wild rooster awakens the soul from its dream." The couplets written by various trade associations were also remarkable.</p>
<p>Representatives Arrive: Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Yichen of the Municipal Federation of Citizens, and Cao Zhigong of the General Federation of Commerce were the first to arrive. They were followed by Wang Luyi of the Central Executive Committee, Gao Yihan of the National Government Supervisory Yuan, Wu Tiecheng of the Military Affairs Commission and the Municipal Government, Cai Tingkai, the commander of the 19th Army, Fan Qiwu, the director of the Rear Affairs Office, Zhu Feinan, the chief of staff of the Fifth Army, Jiang Bingheng of the Ministry of Military Administration, Ye Baoqi of the Naval Headquarters, Zhang Xiang and Wen Ti of the Garrison Headquarters, Ye Hongji of the Foreign Affairs Office, Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Dai Hongji of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, Liang Renjie of the Third Branch, Chen Jianru representing Sun Ke, Lin Kanghou of the Bankers Association, Xu Shiying and E Runzhi of the Xinwei Relief Association, Zhu Qinglan and Cha Liangzhao of the Local Autonomy Association, Shen Junru of the Lawyers Association, and representatives of the National Crisis Relief Association, totaling over two thousand people.</p>
<p>The Memorial Ceremony: At ten o'clock in the morning, the announcement was made that the ceremony would begin. The China Alarm Bell Association rang the alarm bell twenty-one times, its resounding sound deeply resonating with those present. The chief officiant and assistant officiant then took their seats. Everyone stood in silence and bowed three times to the flags of the Party and the nation and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, sang the Party anthem, and bowed three times to the martyrs of the Songhu Resistance and the compatriots who died in the disaster, and observed three minutes of silence to mourn the martyrs of the Songhu Resistance and the compatriots who died in the disaster. Chief Officiant Wang Xiaolai delivered a eulogy and presented a flower garden, Party, government, and military representatives offered sacrifices, elegiac music was played, General Cai Tingkai delivered a speech, more elegiac music was played, and slogans were shouted. The ceremony concluded at eleven fifteen.</p>
<p>Eulogy by the Chief Officiant: Chief Officiant Wang Xiaolai's eulogy roughly stated: "Today, in the cold wind and bitter rain, we hold this solemn and enthusiastic memorial service for the martyrs of the Songhu Resistance and the compatriots who died in the disaster. When we recall the tragedy of January 28th up to this day, now that the war is over and we hold this memorial service, what are our thoughts? Personally, I have nothing to say at this meeting. Moreover, life is a hundred years, and death is inevitable. However, like a family, parents, children, enjoying the happiness of family life, but the parents die, what do they die for? In other words, the martyrs and compatriots who died in the Songhu Resistance did not sacrifice for themselves, but for the survival of the Chinese nation. If we can think of it this way, those of us who are not yet dead should continue the martyrs' hot blood, take responsibility, and work hard. We also feel that during the Songhu Resistance, our innocent people and great buildings in the Zhabei area were sacrificed and destroyed by enemy planes, bombs, and artillery shells in vain. Now, Wusong and Jiangwan have become wastelands. Therefore, on the one hand, we must remember the pain of the martyrs and innocent people, and adhere to the idiom "Never forget this day" and "Swear to avenge the national humiliation". On the other hand, we must unite to abolish the civil war, in order to be worthy of the martyrs and compatriots who died today. This is also the responsibility of those of us who survive."</p>

<p>General Cai Tingkai's Speech: "Today, all sectors of Shanghai hold this memorial service for the martyrs of the Songhu Resistance and the compatriots who died in the disaster. I have come to participate, and I feel that this is the most tragic event. If the invaders are not expelled and the national crisis is not over, there is nothing more I can say. I only hope that we will unite to resist foreign aggression. The significance of today's meeting is extremely great, and it is not merely holding a memorial service and then finishing. The national crisis is pressing. Unless all compatriots unite to devise a plan to deal with it and fight to the end, we will not live up to the meaning of today's memorial service.</p>
<p>We hope to implement the anti-Japanese policy in the future, and we hope that all compatriots will work hard to move forward." His words were extremely painful, and all who heard them were moved.</p>
<h3>General Cai Tingkai and Mr. Wang Xiaolai (Xu Tianzhang Photo) Delivering Speeches at the Meeting</h3>
<p>Sacrificial Oration by the Ministry of Military Administration: On June 10, the Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin, Political Vice Minister Chen Yi, and Permanent Vice Minister Cao Haosen, offer this bouquet of fresh flowers to the spirits of the martyrs of the Songhu Resistance and the compatriots who died in the disaster, saying: Alas, Heaven is clouded, and we suffer this great calamity. The monkeys and cranes call out for souls, the dark earth turns to blood. Recalling the past, the conflict arose with our Eastern neighbor. With greedy eyes, they sought to swallow us. In an instant, they were like mad dogs, repeatedly displaying their ferocity, drooling over this piece of flesh. The banks of the Songjiang River became a war zone, and where the vicious ones went, the villages became ruins. Alas, my compatriots, rising up in anger, why live a life of ignominy, we would rather die. Seven feet tall, we received it from Heaven. We would rather be broken jade than whole tiles. The magnificent spirit fills the world, Confucius spoke of achieving benevolence, Mencius spoke of taking righteousness. Men serve the nation, deterring those vile barbarians. Once they die for righteousness, a hundred days of grief. Alas, we cry out to Heaven, the turbulent streams sob. Grieving for the past and mourning for the present, we are overwhelmed with sorrow.</p>
<p>Who does not die, but death is as heavy as Mount Tai. With lofty brows and outstanding features, their hearts and souls are fragrant. Departed compatriots, the national humiliation has not been avenged, let us learn from the predecessors, those who survive have a responsibility. This bouquet of fresh flowers is respectfully offered before your spirits. May you, in the underworld, know of this sincerity and good intentions. Accept this offering!</p>
<p>Sacrificial Oration by the Municipal Government: On June 12, of the 21st year of the Republic of China, Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, leading all colleagues of the Municipal Government, offer incense, flowers, wine, and libations to the spirits of the martyrs of the Songhu Resistance and the compatriots who died in the disaster, saying: Alas, bones cover the fields, blood fills the ditches, the squares are rubble, the dry trees are stumps. Who can read the text of an ancient battlefield without their tears wetting their sleeves? Alas, lamenting the decline of the nation, sighing at the perilous state of the country, politics are not cultivated, disasters encroach, and the whole country is apathetic as before. When people insult themselves, others will insult them. Although the neighboring countries are tyrannical, but our being looked down upon has a long history. Otherwise, how would the words "occupy Zhabei in four hours" dare to be spoken so freely? If not for the 45 days of resistance, how would we wash away the nation's shame and the nation's humiliation? Today, we can make the strong invaders tremble, and the world pay attention, thanks to the loyal and struggling generals and soldiers, and the compatriots who disregarded sacrifice. Alas, the dead are gone, the responsibilities of the living have become even greater. Can they maintain this glory and carry it forward, or will they lose it and be laughed at by the world? Alas, will we, descendants of the divine, bring ourselves to destruction? Why not change course, wash away the long-standing habits of decline, and strive for survival? Then the meaning of this war is even greater, and the value of the sacrifice is even more significant, and the eyes of the dead can be closed in peace. Otherwise, we are all sinners against the martyred soldiers, this glorious history will also fall to the ground, and the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction is imminent. Shouldn't we be afraid? Wu Tiecheng and others are responsible for protecting the territory and securing the people, but cannot pacify the region, and cannot prevent disasters. Witnessing the intensity of the war, the brutality of the burning and killing, grieving for our soldiers and civilians, either filling the ditches or turning into insects, we cannot rescue them, and we cannot offer assistance. Our hearts are broken, we wipe our tears and sigh, we are distressed for months. Alas, swords and sabers move automatically, knowing that the spirits have never departed, banners still exist, the gods are still there. Therefore, we write the following: The fierce invaders are as violent as wolves and tigers, they treat us like fish to be slaughtered, alas, the people drink bullets and face the axe, great are our national troops, loyal and brave, death is as heavy as Mount Tai, their names will last forever, with grief and anger, we resist the foreign aggressors, alas, accept this offering.</p>
<p>Sacrificial Oration by the Municipal Party Headquarters: The Municipal Party Headquarters offers, with utmost sincerity, sacrifices to the spirits of the martyrs of the Songhu Resistance, saying:</p>
<p>Alas, the strong invaders press the border, they encroach upon us like silkworms and swallow us like whales. Having already seized our Eastern Province, they now eye our Shanghai. Malevolent energy fills the air, and righteousness fades away. Although we have a duty to defend our territory, who is there to protect the nation? It is our soldiers, brave and loyal, who vow to wield their weapons and sweep away the flames of the enemy. They pledge their hot blood to revitalize our undying national spirit. They would rather be smashed to pieces than surrender an inch of territory to the enemy. Therefore, they were able to awe all nations and move all three armies. Charging forward with bows and arrows, seizing flags and leading the charge, they decided ten times and won ten times, fought a hundred battles and won a hundred battles. For the sake of national freedom, for the sake of the survival of the nation, they treated danger as if it were flat ground, and regarded death as if it were life. Alas, martyrs, Mount Tai is heavy, a feather is light. They killed the enemy, defended the country, and saved the people. Although those who achieve benevolence may not necessarily succeed, those who succeed must first achieve benevolence. To kill the enemy and achieve the desired result, and to continue their work and fulfill their ambitions, is up to us, the survivors. We vow to sleep on brushwood and taste gall, to avenge the national humiliation, in order to comfort the spirits of our martyrs.</p>

<p>May the spirits descend, may they come to enjoy, may they partake of this offering.</p>
<p>Memorial Oration by the General Labor Union: "Oration by the National Postal Workers' General Union in Commemoration of the Martyrs Who Died in the Songhu Battles and the Compatriots Who Perished in the Disaster. On this tenth day of June in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the National Postal Workers' General Union, with offerings of incense, flowers, tea, and food, solemnly commemorates the spirits of the martyrs who died in the Songhu Battles and the compatriots who perished in the disaster, saying: Alas, the nation has demons, the nation has misfortune. The small barbarians from the island dared to encroach upon our territory, reversing right and wrong, staining the Yellow River with blood. Alas, we are not martial enough, and the enemy's flames are raging. Abetting the enemy's flames, disaster has been brought upon Shanghai. Soldiers and officers reported to the nation, their cries were passionate and high-spirited. Calmly embracing righteousness, they faced the sharpness of blades. All with blood were loyal, pursuing and driving out the fleeing enemy, invincible in their advance, causing the sun to lose its light. Vowing to avenge the national humiliation, never forgetting until death. The loyal souls seem relieved, lingering anxiously day and night. Heaven does not bless us, jackals and wolves swarm. Loyal and brave soldiers, wounded and injured. The masses, where are their bodies hidden? Regardless of high or low status, all suffer this calamity. Alas, alas, the dead are immortal, how shall the living preserve themselves? May we become vengeful ghosts to exorcise this misfortune."</p>
<h3>Special Martial Law Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>A Memorial Service Also Held at the Public Sports Ground</p>
<p>More Than 500 People Dispersed by Police</p>

<p>The Shanghai Citizens' United Association Against the Armistice Agreement and in Support of the Northeast Volunteers held a memorial meeting for the martyrs who died resisting Japan in Northeast China and Shanghai at the West Gate Public Sports Ground at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, fearing that thugs would infiltrate and take the opportunity to cause trouble, ordered the event prohibited and declared special martial law. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, representatives from various groups continuously arrived at the Public Sports Ground, preparing to hold the meeting when they were dispersed by the police. The situation was chaotic for a time, fortunately without any incident. Details of various aspects are recorded below:</p>

<p>Gathering to Protest: Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, several dozen people resembling workers and students near the West Gate Public Sports Ground held bamboo flags inscribed with "Workers' Delegation of the Commercial Press Participating in the Memorial Meeting." The Municipal Public Security Bureau's police detachment and officers from the Second District General Office were stopping them when six large trucks from the China Moving Company suddenly arrived, filled with participants, flower wreaths, elegiac couplets, and flags. At that time, the police officers advised them not to gather during martial law, but the participants insisted, shouting various slogans, distributing leaflets, and forcibly opening the sports ground gate, rushing in. The police officers' attempts to stop them were ineffective. More trucks arrived, filled with workers and students from the textile factories, joining the participation. The total number of men and women exceeded 500, and they announced the start of the meeting.</p>
<p>Dispersing the Crowd: The Municipal Public Security Bureau, considering that the meeting was disobedient to advice, had the police detachment disperse the crowd. At that time, the meeting was in the process of electing a chairman, and the order was disrupted. The crowd retreated in droves towards the West Gate and Xieqiao, leaving flower wreaths, leaflets, and flags scattered all over the ground, shouting slogans. The Public Security Bureau also detained many individuals resembling workers and students, sending them to the General Bureau for handling. At the time, the police officers were ordered to be unarmed and did not carry guns, so no unfortunate incidents occurred.</p>
<p>Many Arrested: Unable to enter and hold the meeting, the crowd still lingered in the rain at the sports ground gate. The Public Security Bureau dispatched more police detachments to suppress them, explaining to the crowd that they were ordered to prohibit it. A few people negotiated with the police, resulting in minor clashes, and nine people were arrested by the Second District Chief of Police: Yuan Langgen, Lan Shouren, Chen Hui, Chen Beihai, Luo Baomin, Hu Moqian, Wu Choufa, Luo Beiguang, Wang Xiaolong, and others. They were taken to the district and transferred to the Public Security Bureau. The rest dispersed. All flags, leaflets, and elegiac couplets were discarded on the ground. Also, at 11:00 AM, when the crowd dispersed and paraded to the Bund area in the First District, fourteen people were arrested by the police precinct in that section: Li Jijun, Lin Laobin, Lin Yishu, Liu Zhichao, Yang Liansheng, Wan Lie, Ying Huairen, Zhang</p>

They were taken to the First District and sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation. It was heard that after being briefly admonished, they were immediately released.</p>
<p>Traffic Disrupted: After receiving the report, the French Concession Police Department closed the iron gates at Nanyangqiao and other places at 10:30 AM, disrupting traffic. As a result, trams on Routes 17 and 18 from the Great World to Xieqiao were temporarily suspended. They had not resumed service by nightfall. At the same time, tram service on Route 6 of the French Tramway Company from West Gate to Xieqiao and public buses of the China General Omnibus Company from West Gate to Xieqiao were also suspended for about an hour. Services only resumed after the crowd dispersed.</p>
<p>Peaceful Evening: After the incident, police officers of the Municipal Public Security Bureau found a flower wreath left behind by the meeting at the Public Sports Ground, a large white cloth flag that read "Shanghai Citizens' United Association Against the Armistice Agreement and in Support of the Northeast Volunteers Commemorates the Martyrs Who Died Resisting Japan in Northeast China and Shanghai," many silk inspection, command, traffic, and various participating group flags, and various types of leaflets. At 1:00 PM, the police detachment of the Public Sports Ground began to withdraw, leaving only a few police officers from the Second District stationed to provide security and prevent further incidents.</p>
<p>Security measures were lifted at the borders of the Chinese and Concession areas. The evening was peaceful.</p>
<h3>The Hurricane Is Blowing Northwards</h3>
<p>Shanghai Fortunate to Escape Its Visit</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported: According to staff at the Xujiahui Observatory, the gusts of wind that blew through Shanghai yesterday (11th) afternoon and evening made many people apprehensive, fearing that the hurricane would visit Shanghai this morning (12th). Fortunately, later news of the hurricane indicated that it was still moving northward and would probably pass two hundred miles east of Shanghai today. (According to the Observatory's report on the evening of the 12th, the hurricane was lingering near Okinawa and had not moved north.) According to reports, this hurricane was caused by a low-pressure center that formed near Taiwan on Friday night. It blew across the East China Sea last night and moved north. This low-pressure area covers a wide range, encompassing the entire eastern part of China and the Yangtze River basin. However, the hurricane's trajectory has not shown any signs of shifting westward. The force of the hurricane is reportedly not particularly strong, and its movement is not very rapid. However, it is unusual for a hurricane to occur so early in the year.</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: The northern part of the East China Sea has bad weather due to a low pressure that appears to be slowly moving northeast-east. Around Naha, the winds are still strong because the hurricane seems to have lingered and is gradually weakening. The Yangtze River estuary is overcast, and the Yangtze River basin is gradually clearing. Along the coast, the Taiwan Strait, and the Shandong coastline, there are localized areas of heavy fog. The center of the hurricane was within 120 miles of the intersection of 26 degrees north latitude and 126 degrees east longitude around 9:00 AM this morning and was moving very slowly, showing signs of lingering. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this area was 80.8 degrees and the lowest was 69.8 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 89.1 degrees and the lowest was 58.3 degrees.</p>
<p>Demands of Telephone Workers in the Concession</p>
<h3>The Company Replied Yesterday</h3>
<p>Unable to Accept the Basic Conditions</p>
<p>The Strike Committee Immediately Convened an Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday was the sixth day of the telephone workers' strike in the concession. Automatic exchanges continued to operate as normal. The strike committee expanded its organization, and the situation remained serious. The company replied to the 14 demands made by the workers yesterday, stating that it could not accept them. All the workers felt that the company was insincere and convened a temporary emergency meeting that evening to discuss the course of action. The situation is described in detail below:</p>
<p>Police Notification: Yesterday was Sunday. The main office of the telephone company on Jiangxi Road and the branches in various districts were closed, and senior foreign staff stopped working as usual. However, the police had been ordered to send Chinese constables to guard the entrance of the company to provide protection. The Political Department of the General Police Station of the Public Concession specially sent Detective Zhang Yingmei to the contact point of the telephone workers' strike committee at the Commercial Hotel on Avenue Edouard VII to state that West Superintendent had instructed that the company's response to the workers' demands had been translated and requested that representatives be sent to the New Central Bank on Fujian Road at 2:00 PM for negotiations.</p>
<p>Company Response: After the strike committee received the police notification, they sent representatives Zheng Luojie, Weng Zhenhua, Xu Ruze, and Pan Dingquan at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>At the time, Company Engineer Harrison refuted the demands raised by the workers and, after the company had translated the English version and considered them, stated that they could not be accepted. This strike was actually instigated by a few troublemakers. It was hoped that they would resume work first. Thereupon, the representatives believed that the company was too insincere in negotiating and left together.</p>
<p>Company Announcement: The Shanghai Telephone Company's announcement to all workers stated: On June 9th, the Shanghai Telephone Company received two documents from the Shanghai Telephone Company Workers' Strike Committee, one of which contained the reasons for the current workers' strike (1) The company did not reward the workers for continuing to work during the Sino-Japanese War; (2) The company cancelled Sunday work and the wage increase regulations in April; (3) The company did not compensate for the dismissal of a large number of workers and denied</p>
<p>workers the right to participate in pensions, which had been confiscated; (4) The company plans to hire White Russians to replace Chinese workers. It is claimed that because of the above reasons, the workers began a strike at 7:00 PM on June 7th. However, it should be noted that the company was not notified in advance. It also stated that due to the above reasons, the workers abandoned public convenience and stopped working, and now they have made various demands. Regarding the above accusations against the company, the answers are as follows: (A) (1) The company continued to pay the full wages to many workers who were unable to work due to the war; (2) When the war broke out, the company paid workers double the amount of overtime pay; (3) The company provided many workers with free food; (4) The company accommodated many workers and their families to avoid the war. (B) (1) Due to the company's internal reorganization plan, Sunday overtime pay was greatly reduced; (2) Due to business reasons, the wages of workers in April were not increased. (C) As for the company's dismissal of workers, it was because the reorganization plan was in progress. However, the company paid pensions in accordance with the regulations, and in addition, they received more than the company was supposed to pay. (D) The company has not hired White Russians to replace Chinese workers, and there are no such plans to date. The company cannot recognize the union and does not want to handle any matters related to the union and the company through the union. Your workers are obviously being fooled by bad elements. Many of the demands are completely unacceptable. Some of them have nothing to do with the workers who have left their jobs, and the rest are untrue. The workers' strike this time disregards public convenience, and they did not give prior notice. It is dereliction of duty to the public. Moreover, during the strike, they also tried to destroy the machines, intending to cut off communications. The blame for disrupting the public is not slight. The company does not believe that the workers express sympathy for this kind of behavior. It only wants to think that this matter is entirely the work of a few instigators, and that the entire body of workers does not approve of this action. The company believes that all workers have been fooled, and after receiving this announcement, they will definitely realize and will no longer sympathize with the agitators' movement. Therefore, it is advised that all workers immediately resume work. The company is very willing to meet with the workers and discuss any issues raised by the workers in accordance with the company's procedures. The company's manager is also very happy to discuss with the workers various issues concerning the workers, and to accept and modify various feasible and reasonable methods. However, the twelve striking workers in the four districts who damaged the machines will be dismissed.</p>
<p>Shanghai Telephone Company, 11 June 1932.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting: After the representatives withdrew, they reported to the strike committee. The chairman of the strike committee was immediately convened to discuss how to deal with the company. It was decided to convene a temporary emergency meeting at 9:30 PM that afternoon, and the documentation group rushed to issue an emergency notice, urging all members to attend in order to discuss concrete ways to deal with the company and the future course of action.</p>
<p>Workers' Statement: Yesterday, the striking workers in various district branches and warehouses of the telephone company held separate meetings on the order of the strike committee to discuss ways to intensify their work, improve the small group organization, establish a discipline enforcement task force, strictly guard against those who undermine strike discipline, establish fundraising teams in each industry, create flags and donation books, and prepare to go out and raise donations. Also, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency met with a member of the strike committee yesterday. According to the company's reply to our demands, the text is simple and can be said to be a rejection letter. Our basic conditions were completely rejected. Such oppression is hateful. Now all the workers have decided to discuss the second step of dealing with it.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Report</p>
<h3>Reasons for Song Ziwen's Resignation</h3>
<p>The Opium Monopoly Plan Failed</p>
<p>But His Confidants Tried Hard to Implement It</p>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper Shanghai Mainichi Shinbun published on the 12th, Song Ziwen resigned because the central government's finances were exhausted and the funds for the communist suppression had not been settled. He had contacted local financial groups for loans but to no avail. He was furious and resigned. Wang Jingwei came to Shanghai to persuade him to stay, but Song has not yet expressed any news of returning to office. However, according to reliable sources, Song has been trying to implement the opium monopoly plan, which was proposed last year but failed. His confidants Zhang Shouyong and Tang Haian are trying hard to implement the monopoly plan, which is still being implemented according to the plan set last year. A general bureau will be established in Nanjing, and branch bureaus will be established in Shanghai, Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang and other ports, gradually extending to the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian. It is estimated that the annual tax revenue can reach 200 million yuan, that is, even in Shanghai alone, it can</p>
<p>yield five or six million yuan per month.</p>
<h3>Management Committee for Wounded Soldiers Ends</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, fighting the Japanese in bloody battles for several months, have seen many of our loyal soldiers wounded by enemy artillery shells, bombs, machine guns and other military weapons. The people of Shanghai enthusiastically provided relief and established more than seventy wounded soldier hospitals. Doctors, male and female students from various schools, and famous ladies volunteered to go to the hospitals to diagnose and care for the wounded soldiers, tireless in their efforts, their enthusiasm is especially admirable. The Shanghai Office of the General Headquarters of the 19th Route Army also established a Management Committee for Wounded Soldiers in Shanghai at that time, sending Chief of Staff Zhan Baoguang of the General Headquarters as the chairman, and jointly organizing it with personnel dispatched by the various divisions of the 19th Army and the 5th Army. It has been over three months since its establishment. Now more than 90% of the wounded officers and soldiers have recovered and returned to their units. At present, there are only a few hundred seriously wounded and disabled soldiers left, so the Management Committee does not need to be established for a long time. It has been ordered to end immediately, and all unfinished matters after the end have been handed over to the personnel sent by each division for direct handling. The personnel sent by each division to take over the association are: Yu Huixun, adjutant of the 60th Division, Lin Ziyu, adjutant of the 61st Division, Zhang Baoying, adjutant of the 78th Division, and the 87th and 88th Divisions are managed by the Shanghai Office of the 5th Army. They are now continuing to be responsible for managing the wounded officers and soldiers of their respective divisions.</p>

<p>Industrial and Commercial Rehabilitation Association in Disaster Areas</p>
<h3>Submitting a Petition to the Municipal Government to Exempt Donations and Taxes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Rehabilitation Association in Disaster Areas yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Government, stating: "In order to petition for the exemption of donations and taxes in the disaster area, we respectfully request your review and approval to benefit the recovery of Jiangsu. On January 28th, the Japanese bandits caused disaster, and Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong and other places were the first to suffer a catastrophe. Industrial and commercial enterprises were either destroyed by the bombardment of artillery fire or looted by the Japanese bandits. The land is full of scars and scorched earth. It is not easy to recover, and the exemption of taxes and donations is the first priority. Although paying taxes is a national obligation that citizens should fulfill, it must also depend on the people's ability to pay taxes. If people are trying to survive, they don't even have time, and then they are taxed with various taxes and donations. It not only obstructs the future tax revenue of the country, but also drives the people into deeper waters. What's more, the disaster area in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong has suffered a catastrophe, and most of them have</p>
<p>sacrificed for the nation and the country. Our government should give special care and exempt all local taxes and donations, so that the survivors after the catastrophe will not have their livelihoods cut off due to the burden of heavy taxes, and industrial and commercial enterprises can gradually recover. The recovery of industrial and commercial enterprises is to cultivate the future tax revenue of the country, so the exemption of donations and taxes temporarily reduces its income in government finances, while the future national wealth is actually hidden in the dark. The so-called abandonment today, how can we not hope to be compensated in the future, and the grace to the disaster victims is also not small, which is beneficial to both the public and private. It is reasonable to submit a formal document, respectfully requesting your review and approval, and issuing a general order to comply with it, so as to benefit the recovery and show our willingness to help Jiangsu. It is most convenient for the public."</p>

<h3>Post-War Reconstruction Bonds in the War Zone Will Be Stopped</h3>
<p>The 20 million yuan of post-war reconstruction bonds assumed to be issued at the second plenary meeting of the Post-War Reconstruction Committee in the Songhu War Zone will be stopped because of the government's financial difficulties and the difficulty in raising funds in the financial community. Only 800,000 yuan will be allocated by the government, and 300,000 yuan will be assumed by the local association, totaling 100</p>
<p>100,000 yuan, to serve as emergency relief funds for the war zone.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Relief for Disaster Areas in Baoshan County</h3>
<p>A Public Letter from Sun Xiwen</p>
<p>Sun Xiwen, the magistrate of Baoshan County, is quite enthusiastic about the relief of disaster areas in the county. He sent a public letter to the War Relief Association, stating his opinions. Now, the original letter is recorded below for your information:</p>
<p>"I have already reported to the provincial authorities about the devastation from the war in this county, as well as the findings from my inspections. I have also explained the situation in detail to Chairman Zhang, Mr. Jin Jushan, Mr. Hou Cheng, and others. When you were in the area, you showed deep concern for your hometown and felt the suffering deeply. I believe you have already been planning for the aftermath and relief measures. However, there are a few points that urgently need attention during implementation. Based on my limited understanding, I cannot remain silent and dare to offer my humble opinion for your consideration.</p>
<p>Baoshan County's agriculture, industry, and commerce have always been very weak. It is already difficult to make a living in normal times, so how can we withstand such a disaster again? Unfortunately, due to the recent events, the entire county has become a war zone. Considering the disaster situation in the three counties of Tai, Jia, and Bao, Baoshan County accounts for three-fifths of the total. Since the province has allocated funds for relief, the amount of funding should be determined based on the severity of the disaster. If the allocation is distributed equally by county, it will not be fair. It will be difficult to provide comprehensive relief to the more severely affected areas of Baoshan County. This is the first point that the Association should pay attention to regarding the allocation of provincial funds.</p>
<p>I have inspected the disaster areas extensively, and the impact on agriculture has been enormous. Small industries and businesses have also had their houses destroyed and their capital wiped out. The suffering of displacement and the difficulty of recovery are even greater than those of farmers. Most of the schools in the county have been occupied by the Japanese army, and there has been much damage, making it difficult to reopen them. Children have been out of school for too long, and they will become accustomed to idleness, which will become a burden on society. When implementing relief in the future, it seems appropriate to consider all of the above-mentioned sectors, distinguish between urgent and less urgent needs, and appropriately allocate funds based on the severity of the disaster. This is the second point that the Association should pay attention to regarding the allocation of relief funds.</p>
<p>This war has caused severe damage, and after last year's flood, agriculture, industry, and commerce have almost collapsed. If only relief funds are given without considering the aftermath, relief will never be thorough. When disaster victims receive relief, they may not have to worry about starvation, but after receiving relief, they will still be poor as before. The relief funds will be gone, and they will still be in urgent need of relief. The situation will be no different from before the relief. Generous assistance and helping the public are virtues cherished by Yao and Shun, but indiscriminate handouts are not favored by poverty alleviation policies in various countries. Therefore, this time, it is better to lend money at low interest rates than to give it away. If it is absolutely necessary to distribute emergency relief, it should be kept to a minimum. Giving provides temporary benefit; disaster victims see it as a windfall and spend it carelessly. Once it is used up, it is difficult to continue. If they have to repay a loan, they will inevitably work hard to manage their affairs. Even if they lose money, some of the principal will remain, which can be borrowed again. Livelihoods are difficult after a disaster, and many people will inevitably lose their jobs. If there is no plan to help them, it will cause social problems and burden public security.</p>
<p>In my opinion, if the funds allocated by the province are not large, in addition to emergency relief, four or five million yuan could be allocated to establish a lending office or a low-interest bureau, setting the lowest interest rate and a generous repayment period to provide working capital. If the funds allocated by the province are as expected, it seems that one hundred thousand yuan could be allocated to establish a local bank. On the one hand, low-interest loans could be given to agriculture, industry, and commerce to provide capital for operations. On the other hand, the county treasury could be managed to collect idle funds and use them to generate interest. This would not only regulate the local financial situation but also support various industries and provide them with opportunities for recovery. After the bank is established and the financial situation is fluid, further plans can be made. With the assistance of the local bank, efforts can be made to establish more small-scale factories, promote handicrafts, and accommodate the unemployed and vagrants, directly increasing production and indirectly maintaining public order.</p>
<p>The reason why Baoshan County's industry and commerce cannot flourish and local enterprises cannot develop is the lack of a financial institution to regulate them. Tai and Jia counties both have local banks, and their pawnshop businesses are particularly developed. Therefore, industry and commerce in these areas are generally more prosperous than in Baoshan County. Although they suffered the same disaster, local institutions were able to quickly establish a rough framework and carry out various tasks after the incident. This is partly due to the fact that these areas are wealthier and the disaster was less severe, but the main reason is the support of financial institutions. Finance is as important as the lifeblood of the human body. Post-disaster relief must consider long-term solutions. Baoshan County lacks financial resources and wealthy individuals, making it difficult to establish a bank even in normal times. After this devastating disaster, it is even more difficult to make it a reality. Although the funds allocated by the province are limited, they are the result of your efforts and appeals over the past few months, and it is not easy to obtain them. If the traditional relief methods can be changed and the distributed funds can be used as a fund for development, it will not only be consistent with the purpose of relief but also be a key to revitalizing the local economy. This is not only a win-win situation but also a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. This is the third point that the Association should pay attention to regarding relief policy. I hope you will carefully consider and handle the above points. It would be a great blessing for the area."</p>

It is reported that representatives of the Fuzhou Chamber of Commerce and the Alumni Association of the Four Schools, Chen Songyu, and representatives of the Education Association and the Press Association, Xia Hongshou, and representatives of the Labor Union and the Farmers' Association, Chen Chunfo, arrived in Shanghai on the Yusheng Merchant Ship yesterday and are scheduled to go to Suzhou today to meet Cai with a formal letter. The original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"To Commander-in-Chief Cai Tingkai and Commander Xianchu: The merchants of this association, residing in the remote area of Zuohai, have long admired your reputation and military skills. We have been unable to meet you in person. Now, we have heard that you have been ordered to come to Fujian to eliminate the Red bandits. Your reputation has spread, and the entire province of Fujian is rejoicing. We are eager to see you arrive and hope that you will eradicate the bandits and bring peace to our land. Merchants like us, living in the marketplace, are afraid of the Red Eyebrows' tyranny. We hope you will save the people from fire and water, and we will follow your lead. We have specially sent representative Chen Konggu to visit you and express our welcome. If you allow us to follow your lead, we will not hesitate to serve you. We respectfully submit this letter and wish you peace. (Omitted below)"</p>

<h3>Request to Postpone the Abolition of the Pacification Commissioner's Office</h3>
<p>The Yangzhou Eight Counties Shanghai Fellow Association sent a telegram to the National Government yesterday, stating: "To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Premier Wang Jingwei of the National Government: It is reported that the Jiangsu Province Pacification Commissioner's Office has been closed. We believe that the northern Jiangsu counties are areas where bandits are rampant, and the people suffer from them daily. Since Commissioner Zhang assumed office, pacification has been successful, bandits have disappeared, and the people can sleep soundly. In addition, after the flood, the spring harvest is hopeless, refugees have no way to make a living, the communists are planning to act, and bandits are increasing, causing hidden dangers and worries. Now that we hear that the office is being abolished, it is like a great disaster is about to befall us. Now that Chairman Chiang is personally going to Anhui and Henan to eliminate the bandits, the stability of the rear is very important. For the sake of the country and the local area, we dare to send a telegram requesting you to consider the people's sentiments and postpone the abolition of the Jiangsu Province Pacification Commissioner's Office to maintain order and stability in the area. We await your command with anticipation. Respectfully, the Yangzhou Eight Counties Shanghai Fellow Association."</p>
<h3>Commander Cai Visited the National Goods Shopping Mall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various circles in this city held a memorial service for the soldiers and compatriots who died in the Songhu Anti-Japanese War at the City Chamber of Commerce. Cai Tingkai, the commander of the 19th Route Army, and Dai Ji, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, personally attended the meeting to express their condolences. After the meeting, Commander Cai said that he was deeply sorry for not being able to attend the opening ceremony of the National Goods Exhibition jointly organized by the City Chamber of Commerce on June 6 due to busy military affairs. Taking advantage of his stay in Shanghai, he was accompanied by Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to visit the National Goods Shopping Mall and the National Goods Exhibition. He toured extensively from the first floor to the fourth floor and highly praised the National Goods Shopping Mall for its abundant supply of national goods and its excellent management. He was particularly satisfied with the goods from Waseng Electric Appliance Factory, Fengzhang Textile Factory, Dahua Iron Factory, Tianfu Silk, Jinhua National Goods Company, Yicheng Company, Watson Soda Factory, and Huahua Store.</p>

<h3>Reorganization Plan of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Planning to Borrow Large Sums of Money</p>
<p>To Add New Shipping Routes</p>
<p>The Daily News reports that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, directly under the Ministry of Communications, has more than 30 branch offices along the Yangtze River and the coast. The total revenue is no less than tens of millions, but the expenses of the branch offices are too high, so the head office not only has no profit but also accumulates debts. Therefore, the Ministry reorganized the company on May 1 and appointed Chen Fumu, Vice Minister of the Ministry, as supervisor. After taking office, Chen immediately began to reorganize the company's affairs. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Expanding Shipping Vessels and Repaying Old Debts</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that in recent years, China's doors have been opened wide, and foreign ships travel freely in the inland seas and rivers, causing domestic shipping companies to be excluded. At a time when the government is preparing to recover the shipping industry, it is necessary to actively expand domestic shipping in advance to meet future needs. The Ministry has ordered the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to draw up a sound plan to expand shipping vessels and to thoroughly repay the company's previous debts. It has borrowed 30 million yuan from the Dalae Company, of which 10 million yuan will be used to repay previous debts, and the remaining 20 million yuan will be used to purchase additional shipping vessels. It is reported that the loan has been negotiated and will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Scheduled Sailings on the Southeast Asian Route</p>
<p>The company already has domestic shipping routes, including Shanghai-Qingdao, Yangtze River, Shanghai-Guangdong, and Shanghai-Oujiang. It has not yet opened a Southeast Asian route, so Chinese expatriates doing business in Southeast Asia must travel on foreign ships. It is planned to open a Southeast Asian route to avoid the oppression of foreign ships. The company has purchased a ship from Norway and named it "Hai Rui" and "Hai Xiang" for exclusive use on the Southeast Asian route. It is reported that scheduled sailings will officially begin at the beginning of next month, exclusively for the use of Chinese expatriates doing business, in order to gradually recover China's lost overseas shipping rights. It is also understood that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has planned to reform the company's personnel and eliminate accumulated business malpractices.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Xin Zhuang Military-Civilian Get-Together</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, heavy troops have been stationed in Xin Zhuang Town, Shanghai. Zhao Junmai, the regimental commander of the First Regiment of the Customs Police Corps, is skilled in military administration and has strict discipline. The locals respect and love him very much. A military-civilian get-together was held at the Sixth Elementary School in the town the other day to demonstrate military-civilian cooperation and mutual assistance. The weather was clear and refreshing that day. The opening ceremony was held at 10 a.m. After formalities, Yang, the regimental adjutant, chaired the meeting and reported the purpose of the meeting. Zhang Zishi, a representative of the public group, gave a speech on the importance of cooperation and mutual assistance. This was followed by more than 30 entertainment performances. About 5,000 people attended the event, which was very lively. At the end, the local Maintenance Association presented a banner of political virtue, "Qin He Feng Gao," to express their appreciation.</p>
<h3>More Than a Hundred Houses Collapsed in Dachang City</h3>
<p>The Sound Was Like a Mountain Collapse, and the Scene Was Quite Tragic</p>
<p>Many Old People and Children Were Killed and Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 6 o'clock, the houses along the street at the eastern end of Hujia Muqiao in Dachang East Town suddenly collapsed. The sound was like a mountain collapse, and the cries of the old and young were very tragic. More than 100 houses collapsed in total. More than 20 residents of the houses were unable to escape. Several people have been rescued, but many more are feared to have been crushed to death. Some of the belongings and utensils in the houses had been moved out by the residents in advance, but those that were not moved out have been crushed. The houses in Dachang City are very old. During the Shanghai War, Japanese planes bombed and shells shook the ground, causing the foundations to crack. The large-scale collapse was indeed a tragic result of the war.</p>

<h3>General Cai Tingkai Statue Decoration</h3>
<p>General Cai Tingkai was ordered to go south, but people from all walks of life were unable to keep him from leaving. Father Du of the Cai Shi Road Nan Di Catholic Church in the French Concession asked the famous portrait painter Jiang Zhaohe and sculptor Li Yiyi to jointly create his statue, with hundreds of pieces. This was inspired by the French people's worship of Gandhi and the special Gandhi soy sauce bottle.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it can be a permanent commemoration of a hero, and on the other hand, it can be used to store small stationery items. This statue is also different from the general photographs because General Cai is tall and slender, and photographs often cannot capture his frontal view. This statue is based on Jiang Zhaohe's sketches of the general, so it is very lifelike. It is displayed at the Modern Bookstore on Fourth Horse Road and at the Fook Company in the National Goods Shopping Mall. It can also be purchased wholesale.</p>
<h3>Prosperous Atmosphere at the City National Goods Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City National Goods Exhibition and the National Goods Shopping Mall's one-week anniversary sale have been open for eight days. Recently, the area near Suzhou Creek in the North American Concession and Zhabei was devastated by artillery fire, and the market has been sluggish. It has been difficult for residents in both areas to buy national goods. The exhibition was established in response to this situation, so purchasers and visitors flocked to it. The daily number of visitors is about 2,000. This shows that our compatriots' desire to use national goods is growing day by day. It is reported that the best-selling products are seasonal goods, such as Huafu's feather yarn straw hats, Waseng's electric fans, Tianfu and Hongzhang's thin silk fabrics, soft straw mats, Huahua's Samsung and Invincible mosquito coils, Wuzhou's soaps and medicines for cosmetics, Jinhua's undershirts, Hangzhou's paper umbrellas and fans, and Forest's rattan and willow products. The best-selling daily necessities include Zhonghua's enamel washbasins, Ruyi Xiang's brassware, Baoxing's steel fine ware, Shengde's Saizhen products, handkerchiefs, Xiangxing's leather goods, and Zhenhua and Hongkang Xiang's ceramics. The best-selling educational supplies and musical instruments include Renchangyong's glass instruments, Zhonghua Book Company and Zhongfu's books, toys, records, Da Zhonghua's fountain pens, and Yifeng Mingbao's national musical instruments. The best-selling foods and drinks include Guansheng Yuan's candies and biscuits, Yicheng's Yantai beer, Watson's soda, and Huacheng's cigarettes. Other products such as Da Zhonghua's rubber galoshes, Da Feng's raincoats, Da Hua's iron beds, Hequn's Fujian paint, Puqiu's alcohol irons, and Jiading's bamboo carvings are also quite good. I understand that those in charge of the exhibition believe that although the first-floor shopping mall has a prototype, it is limited in size and cannot be fully developed, which is a pity. After the exhibition is over, the existing shopping mall will be expanded to the second floor, completing a two-story display and sales area. The interior will also be renovated to make it more beautiful.</p>
<h3>Liu Manqing Departed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Kuomin News Agency reports that Ms. Liu Manqing, a special commissioner of the Central Government for investigation in Kangzang, arrived in Shanghai some time ago. She was originally scheduled to depart on the Qiongzhou ship on the 10th, but due to banquets and receptions from various circles in recent days, she did not depart until yesterday morning (the 12th), when she and her younger sister, Man Yun (the wife of Gesang Zeren, a special commissioner of the Xijing Party), boarded the Dalae Company's President Lincoln to Hong Kong, then transferred to a ship to Annam Haiphong, and then took the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Kunming. From Kunming, they will travel by horse for four days to Dali, and then five days to Lijiang. Advancing to Adun is the junction of Yunnan and Xikang. After seven days to Jianjing, they will arrive at Baan (the provincial capital of Xikang) in five days. After working in Xikang for two months, they will go to Tibet to investigate everything.</p>
<h3>Canada Needs Domestically Produced Satin Materials</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Xin Rong Company in Vancouver, Canada, stating that the quality of goods and the national economy are as closely related as lifeblood. However, without effective promotion and smooth transportation, it is impossible to gain a foothold in the commercial battlefield. The company deals in woolen materials, and the value of the satin linings and silk hair used for women's clothing each year is enormous. It is very willing to use a large number of domestic goods and has attached samples and a silver note for 200 yuan, asking the Chamber of Commerce to find a way to purchase them. The Chamber of Commerce has forwarded the letter to the Satin Industry Association to find out whether there are similar silk fabrics produced domestically that can be used, and to solicit purchases from member manufacturers to take the lead in promoting domestic satin materials in Canada.</p>
<h3>Gansu Province Urgently Needs National Goods</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Advises Various Industries to Promote Sales</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent letters to the flour industry, mercerized cotton textile industry, Chinese soap industry, silk and satin industry, knitting industry, willow ware industry, Chinese candle industry, coal industry, fur industry, grass and woolen hat industry, candy, biscuit, and canned food industry, native cloth industry, cosmetics industry, porcelain industry, rubber manufacturing industry, woolen fabric factory industry, electrical silk weaving industry, the United Association of Chinese Yarn Factories, the Jiangsu Match Industry United Association, and four national goods groups, saying: "It is reported that Gansu Province claims that the enemy goods are transported from Tianjin, and the freight is not cheaper than in Shanghai. Therefore, there is a great opportunity for domestic goods manufacturers to take advantage of this opportunity to promote their products. The Chamber of Commerce has replied to Chairman Shao of Gansu Province, asking him how to contact the merchants there. The associations should forward this information to their members to prepare in advance. If there are familiar Gansu merchants in Shanghai, they can also consult with them nearby. In short, the sooner this matter is completed, the sooner we can recover the profits. The Chamber of Commerce will notify you separately when Gansu Province sends a letter to the Chamber of Commerce with details of agriculture and mining and other items."</p>

<h3>Ban on Using Straw as Wrapping for Imported Goods</h3>
<p>The Commodity Inspection Bureau Notifies All Merchants to Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce recently received a report from the Consulate General in the Philippines stating that the Director of the Philippines Planting Bureau has issued a letter stating that the use of straw as wrapping for imported goods has been banned since February 1. It has been found that imported Chinese goods are still using straw as wrapping. Please notify the relevant agencies in China to pay special attention. After receiving the report, the Ministry immediately instructed the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to instruct all exporters to strictly observe the regulations. The Bureau immediately notified the Livestock Inspection Office and the relevant merchants to comply.</p>
<h3>French Business Water and Electricity Workers' Demands</h3>
<p>Waiting for Negotiations, No Strike for Now</p>
<p>Mediation May Lead to Resolution</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the entire workforce of the mechanical department of the French business water and electricity company, after organizing the French Business Water and Electricity Workers' Union in the 16th year of the Republic of China, were ordered by the party and government organs to reorganize according to the law and establish the Second District Water and Electricity Industry Union. Since the Shanghai Incident, the company's new manager suddenly canceled the 200 yuan monthly subsidy to the union's office expenses, which had been agreed upon during the previous strike through the mediation of Du Yuesheng, a Chinese director of the French Concession's Public Works Department. After the union sent representatives to negotiate with the new manager without any result, all the workers were very angry and demanded: (1) Restoration of the original 200 yuan monthly subsidy for union office expenses; (2) Release of Xu A'mei, a standing committee member of the union who was arrested last year in connection with a wiring conflict case (according to which Xu A'mei has been sentenced to ten years and six months of imprisonment by the Second Special District Court). The situation is very serious, with a tendency to brew a strike. The French Consul is paying close attention to this case. According to reliable news obtained by the reporter, all the workers have submitted the two demands to the union's council for negotiations with the company. During the council's negotiation period, they will not rashly strike. It is said that some people are trying to mediate, so there may be a considerable hope for a resolution.</p>
<h3>Request to Correct Overcharged General Tax</h3>
<p>Taxpayers' Association's Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession received a letter from citizen Zhang Jianhou, stating that the Public Works Department was overcharging the general tax and requesting negotiation for a refund. Therefore, the association sent a letter to the Public Works Department to negotiate and immediately replied to Mr. Zhang. The Western letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Department: We are writing to you regarding the letter from Mr. Zhang Jianhou of No. 3, Lane 140, Xinzha Road, stating that the citizens have previously relied on your association to uphold justice in the case of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession overcharging the general tax, and that you have sent a letter to the bureau to stop it and replied to them, for which they are truly grateful. However, the bureau did not correct the overcharged amount and return it, but sent an English letter on May 7. At that time, the citizen was away on other duties and did not see the letter until he returned to Shanghai on the first of this month. The citizen does not understand English at all and was in the process of asking a friend to translate it. The other day, the Chinese tax collector of the bureau came to collect the summer general tax. The citizen explained the details in detail and asked him to correct it before taking it away. After a short while, two Westerners came again, their demeanor aggressive, and they threatened in broken Chinese that if the payment was not made, the door would be sealed immediately. We believe that the municipal general tax of the Public Concession is based on rent as the standard. Now, the Public Works Department arbitrarily increases it without seeking the facts, violating the established regulations. Moreover, the reasons stated are all one-sided opinions. According to their claim that due to the existence of a pavilion building, the rent should be increased by six yuan in foreign currency starting from January of this year, it has been found that the citizen moved in during the 14th year of the Republic of China, and the house already had a pavilion building, which was not newly built last year. The bureau has always collected taxes according to the rent and has never had any objections. This year, the people are suffering from the pain of violence and robbery, but they want to increase the burden, which is unreasonable and unjustifiable. It is also said that the citizen sublets the house to others, with an income of seventy yuan, and a net profit of fifteen to twenty yuan per month. This is even more absurd. Not to mention that the citizen does not have this income, even if he could sublet it for seventy yuan, how could there be a net profit of fifteen to twenty yuan, considering that the rent is fifty yuan, plus the city tax of seven yuan, as well as various expenses for electricity, certificates, telephone repairs, etc.? Isn't this just idle fantasy? The citizen is not repeatedly bothering your association for the sake of a mere ten yuan and eight cents per year, but for the sake of all the citizens, directly opposing the bureau's arbitrary increase in taxes and indirectly providing landlords with a basis for raising rents. Therefore, we dare to intrude and continue to request that your association uphold justice and forward a letter to the bureau to implement the correction. We will be deeply grateful for your public spirit, etc., and attach the bureau's letter to the association. We have found that the principle of finance should be simplicity and avoidance of harshness. Using the rent paid by the tenants as the standard for collecting municipal general tax is the most sufficient way to express simplicity and avoid harshness. Your bureau wants to increase taxes because of the subletting and the existence of a pavilion building. Then, in Shanghai, subletting is a common phenomenon. Should the municipal general tax be collected from the sub-tenants? And when the house is vacant and not sublet, can the general tax be reduced or exempted? As for building pavilion buildings, etc., it is even more evident that it is difficult for citizens to live and that rents are high. Furthermore, there are many houses equipped with water heaters, and their rents include the water heater rental fees. Logically, when collecting municipal taxes, the water heater rental fees should be deducted. However, your bureau mostly collects taxes including the water heater rental fees, and even the tap water fees included in the rent are also subject to the general tax. The same is true for the general tax of our association's office. In our association's view, fairness and non-disturbance are paramount in municipal administration. However, the bureau's approach is motivated by a desire to show fairness on the one hand and to increase public revenue on the other. However, it must be known that this is precisely the opportunity for lower-level officials to engage in "underhanded dealings," and as a result, the public revenue increases only slightly, while the losses suffered by the citizens are enormous. According to the aforementioned situation in the letter, we hereby request that your bureau carefully consider and return the overcharged amount. We earnestly hope for this. Addressed to the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Reply to Zhang Jianhou: We are writing to you in response to your letter of June 9 regarding the Public Works Department's assessment of increased taxes, and the Public Works Department's letter has been carefully read. We greatly admire your attitude, as you neither give anything to others improperly nor take anything from others improperly, only following righteousness, which is the traditional spirit of our national culture. In addition to sending another letter to the Public Works Department to correct the matter, we are enclosing the Public Works Department's letter for your reference.</p>
<p>Real Estate Association</p>
<h3>Request for Exemption of Land Tax and Water Fees in War Zones</h3>
<p>The Real Estate Association sent letters to the Public Works Department and the Waterworks Company requesting exemption from land tax and water fees in war zones. (1) Letter to the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department: We are writing to you with the following request, and we earnestly hope that your association will consider and approve it. Due to the rampant activities of certain unstable forces in the Hongkou area, legal protection has lost its effectiveness, and the victims, who are mostly real estate owners, have been exempted from rent according to the exemption measures, which is a considerable loss. In accordance with legal principles and human considerations, it seems that the land tax should receive the same treatment as the exemption from the general tax. We hereby request this and send this letter accordingly. We hope you will investigate and reply. We will be deeply grateful for your public spirit. (2) Letter to the British Shanghai Waterworks Company: We are writing to you because the Japanese army's disturbances in the Hongkou area have made it impossible for residents to live in peace. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession, in view of the people's suffering, has provided exemption from taxes. Real estate owners have also been exempted from rent based on the standards for exemption from the municipal general tax. We believe that during this period, water consumption must be extremely reduced, or even non-existent. If real estate owners have no income at all, and they still have to bear the responsibility of compensating for unused or used water fees, it would truly increase their losses. It seems inappropriate in terms of both law and human considerations. If your company can take into account the facts and exempt water fees in accordance with the Public Works Department's exemption measures, it would be greatly appreciated. We hereby request you to investigate and implement this.</p>
<h3>Xue's Nephews Compete for Inheritance</h3>
<p>First Instance Judgment Favors Nephews</p>
<p>Xue's Appeal Debate Also Concludes</p>
<p>After the wealthy merchant Xue Baorun died, leaving behind millions in inheritance, his sons Xue Gansheng, Yansheng, Jiasheng, Gensheng, etc., distributed it according to the will. However, his nephews Hua Yi and Hua Manyun came forward to claim their rights, citing the Kuomintang's party platform, the resolution on women's movement of the Second National Congress of the Kuomintang, and the current laws on women's inheritance rights, stating that although their mother Hua Xueqin had passed away long ago, they could legally inherit in her place. They requested that the defendants be jointly and severally liable to hand over all of Xue Baorun's inheritance, assign someone to liquidate it, and divide it equally. Since Hua and others were all minors, their father Hua Lihou, in his capacity as legal guardian, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against the defendants in the First Special District Court. After repeated investigations by the court, the plaintiffs won the case, and the defendants were ordered to pay the two plaintiffs two-thirds of the total inheritance within 500,000 yuan. This is the first result of nephews demanding a share of inheritance from their uncles in an inheritance lawsuit in this city after the promulgation of the law on women's inheritance of property. Therefore, since the beginning of this case, lawsuits between nephews and uncles over the distribution of inheritance have sprung up. Although Xue lost the first instance, he was unwilling to yield. He hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, stating that the original judgment had not fully investigated the various points of law and fact claimed by the appellant, and he described them separately, divided into three parts: (1) The distinction between the beginning of inheritance and the right to inherit; (2) Regarding the second point of the original judgment, namely whether Xue Baorun's public inheritance had been divided; (3) The validity of the will. After the case was appealed, Hu Yigu, the presiding judge of the civil division of the Second Branch of the High Court, convened a collegial panel with two associate judges to hear the case. Most of the disputes were legal points, so the lawyers of both parties debated in great detail at the time, quoting extensively from scriptures and questioning each other, which took a long time. Presiding Judge Hu, for the sake of thoroughness, did not tire of deliberation and allowed both parties to fully express their views so that they could be selected. After they finished speaking, he announced the end of the debate and ordered both parties to leave, awaiting the scheduled pronouncement of the judgment.</p>
<h3>Transportation Association Temporarily Suspends Passenger and Freight Transport</h3>
<p>The Jinghu Railway Traffic Department resumed freight trains from the first of this month, tentatively scheduling one round-trip up and down freight train daily from Nanjing Riverbank to Maigen Road to meet urgent needs. Unexpectedly, due to the lack of locomotives, the freight cars that had been loaded since the second day have not been able to depart. The goods entrusted by customers to various transfer companies continue to arrive one after another, and the North Station has no warehouses to store them. Therefore, the Transportation Association convened a meeting the other day and decided to immediately notify all merchants that due to the lack of locomotives in the railway bureau, passenger and freight transportation will be temporarily suspended. They will notify them again once normal operations are restored.</p>
<h3>Calculating Performance Fees Dispute</h3>
<p>Both Parties Have Sued in Court</p>
<p>Actors Tang Longquan, Zhang Guixuan, Lü Qifang, etc., performed at the Southern Theater opened by Wang Yushan in Nanyang Bridge, French Concession. At 10:00 PM on the first of this month, they settled their performance fees with the theater owner and the backstage manager Fan Yunqing, which led to a dispute. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the third night, Tang and others gathered five or six people, each armed with sharp knives, iron rods, and other weapons, and rushed to the Chunxianglou teahouse at No. 178 Bail Road to commit violence. The two sides fought each other, causing Ma Enhong and others who went with them to be stabbed. Afterwards, they were sent to Baolong and Guangci hospitals for treatment. Meanwhile, theater owner Wang Yushan and Fan Yunqing reported to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Tang and the other three, and sent them to the Second Special District Court. The police charged them with the crime of injury under Article 293 of the Criminal Law and detained them. The other day, Judge Li Changnian came to the First Criminal Court for continued interrogation. First, Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, stated the investigation situation of the police, and said that the victim Ma Enhong was still under treatment in the hospital and had not yet recovered, and requested a postponement of the interrogation. After Wang Yushan and Fan Yunqing, the plaintiffs, stated their complaints, the court briefly interrogated the defendants and then approved the postponement, pending the injured person's recovery before further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Shareholder of Hesheng Bank Accuses Manager</h3>
<p>Using Hesheng's Capital</p>
<p>For Speculative Transactions</p>
<p>Chuan Zidong from Sichuan recently hired a lawyer to file a criminal private prosecution with the First Special District Court, accusing Shen Shihua of breach of trust. The gist of his complaint is that in September of last year, the defendant Ao Min and other shareholders raised 30,000 taels in ten shares, each share being 3,000 taels, and opened the Hesheng Bank in Fuxing Lane, Beijing Road. Min recognized one share, and the contract stipulated that the business would be operating securities and earning interest. At that time, the defendant was elected as the manager. It was found that there were three ways to operate securities: (1) receiving interest on time; (2) entering and exiting at any time; (3) earning interest through arbitrage. Unexpectedly, the defendant violated the agreement and used Hesheng's capital for speculative trading, damaging the shareholders' property, which constitutes the crime of breach of trust under Article 366 of the Criminal Law. Moreover, according to the contract, Hesheng's scope of business was limited to shareholders, but the defendant also bought and sold public bonds on behalf of customers, which also constitutes breach of trust. Therefore, he filed the lawsuit. The afternoon before yesterday, Judge Feng of the Special Court opened a court session for questioning. The defendant failed to appear. The plaintiff's lawyer stated the case, and Judge Feng ordered the case to be postponed and summoned the defendant to appear for further questioning.</p>
<h3>China-Germany Trading Company Seeks Domestic Product Samples</h3>
<p>Niu Zhipeng and others, the founders of the Northwest China-Germany Trading Company, have been serving in military, political, and transportation agencies in Shaanxi for many years and are very familiar with the situation in the Northwest. They deeply lament that foreign goods are flooding the markets everywhere, resulting in huge losses, while domestic goods have disappeared from the Northwest, which is extremely painful. Therefore, in November of last year, they organized the Northwest China-Germany Trading Company, with the English name (WorldtradingCo), to develop the Northwest, promote domestic goods, transport well-known local products from various regions, and develop commerce to alleviate people's livelihoods. Unfortunately, the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, and war broke out suddenly, causing obstacles and great losses. After the end of the Shanghai War, they immediately went to Shaanxi to replan, established a head office in Xi'an, and planned to establish branch offices in Shanghai and Lanzhou. Mr. Niu came to Shanghai on the 11th (residing at No. 5, Laolaoxiudeli, Baik Road) and is collecting domestic product samples. He sincerely hopes that domestic product factories in this city will send a copy of their samples and agency regulations for selection and negotiation.</p>

The location is No. 12, Zundeli, Xiamen Road, Zhejiang Road, south of Old Garbage Bridge. However, due to the war this year, it is difficult for the association to raise funds, so it has to change its approach and focus on providing free medical consultations, temporarily suspending the distribution of medicine.</p>

<p>Zhang Tanhu Requests Marital Autonomy</p>
<p>Zhang Tanhu, a 24-year-old woman residing in Zhangjiazhai, Yangjing South, Pudong, was betrothed to Yao Hongquan of Yaojiazhai No. 48 at the age of 15, by the orders of her parents and the words of a matchmaker. Later, Hongquan left Shanghai to study in Harbin for five or six years, without contacting her. When Hongquan returned to Shanghai in the winter of the year before last, her mother-in-law said that her daughter had reached the age of marriage and could not delay her youth any longer. Yao Hongquan agreed to set the wedding date for the first month of last year. Unexpectedly, he broke his promise again when the date arrived. By this year, Yao Hongquan still had no preparations for marriage. Therefore, Zhang Tanhu, seeking marital autonomy, hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to sue the local court, requesting the dissolution of the marriage contract. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen opened the court session, but Yao Hongquan did not appear. Zhang Tanhu appeared in court and stated that the biggest reason was that she had not agreed to the engagement at the time. The second reason was that Yao Hongquan was wandering and unable to marry, and even planned to force the marriage, causing her to suffer lifelong humiliation. Since Yao Hongquan did not appear, the official ordered Zhang Tanhu to formally file a lawsuit for trial.</p>
<p>Shipyard Foreman</p>
<h3>Received Eight Extortion Letters</h3>
<p>The Last Letter Was Especially Fierce</p>
<p>Zhang Guifu from Wuxi, 46 years old, lives at No. 1, Fuxing Lane, Gaochang Temple Road, Nanshi. He is a foreman at the Jiangnan Shipyard. Because of his thrifty nature, he has some savings. Unexpectedly, he was coveted by bandits. Within a month, he received as many as eight extortion letters. The language in the letters gradually became more intense. The last letter even stated that if he did not comply, Zhang's entire family would be put to death. However, when Zhang received the second letter, he took it to the competent</p>
<p>Second District General Office to report it. However, Director Zhang was too busy with official duties to attend to it, which made the bandits even more brazen, sending letters like snowflakes. It is said that the client has now decided on a course of action. If the bandits</p>
<p>still do not repent, he will directly report to the Public Security Bureau and request investigation.</p>
<p>Extortion Gang</p>
<h3>Five More Cases Solved</h3>
<p>Police Request Special Extended Interrogation</p>
<p>Hua Tanmu Shangwu, a detective from the Huishi Police Station, previously arrested He Yongli, Zhou A'ming, and Qi Deguang, three Ningbo people from the extortion gang, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This was reported in this newspaper. Now, Detective Shang has found that He and others specialize in extorting money. In addition to sending an extortion letter to Chen Yushun at No. 15 Yangxing Street, French Concession, on June 1, extorting 10,000 yuan, they also committed five similar cases, all by first sending letters of intimidation to force people to hand over money. The details are recorded below: (1) In June of the 16th year of the Republic of China, they sent a letter to Donglu Bank on Nanjing Road, extorting 200 yuan from He Peiyuan. (2) On April 1 of the 19th year of the Republic of China, they sent a letter to Jidong Bank on Ningbo Road, extorting 300 yuan from He Peiyuan. (3) In May of the 19th year, they sent a letter to Xin Travel Agency on Fuzhou Road, extorting 500 yuan from Yang Ruisheng. (4) On October 19 of the 19th year, they sent a letter to Zhonghua Hotel on Fuzhou Road, extorting 100 yuan from Wang Xiaotang. (5) On April 1 of last year, they sent a letter to Puqing Lane on Minguo Road, French Concession, extorting 45 yuan from Wang Cairong. When questioned, the suspects admitted to all of them. Therefore, the day before yesterday morning, Detective Shang, together with the victims, sent the three suspects He Yongli, etc., to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stood up and stated the case, saying that the situation in this case was complicated and involved many cases, so the interrogation would take a long time, and requested a postponement for a special extended interrogation. Judge Wu Tingqi approved the request and ordered the three defendants to be returned to custody, pending further interrogation on the afternoon of the 21st.</p>

<h3>Peaceful Resolution of Student Protests</h3>
<p>Two Demands of the Normal University Accepted</p>
<p>Students from China College on Strike in Support</p>
<p>Peiping, 11th – As of 9 PM tonight, police and students are still in a standoff in front of the Normal University. The Student Union issued a general strike declaration, opposing Shen Yinmo and the fascistization of education in China. Injured police have been sent to the hospital. Students claim that three students, one cook, and one school worker were arrested. The Normal University School Protection Committee presented four preconditions for negotiation tonight: (1) Withdraw the military and police; (2) Restore telephone service; (3) Release arrested classmates; (4) Written apology. The content of the negotiation concerns ensuring the safety of vehicles leaving southwards, and compensation for losses, all to be borne by the municipal government, with a full response required before 9:30 PM. Peiping Mayor Zhou Da-wen stated that he advocates resolving the student protests peacefully and has telegraphed Zhu Jiahua, asking him to find a solution as soon as possible to prevent the student protests from escalating. Regarding the four conditions raised by the students, he believes it is best not to raise conditions and to handle the matter through legal procedures. The first two conditions have already been implemented. As for the third, the arrested individuals will be released if the students do not proceed to the train station. Regarding the fourth, since the military and police were also injured, an apology should be considered at length. After 9:30 PM tonight, over three hundred batons from the Boy Scouts of the Normal University Affiliated High School were transported to the Normal University, and the number of patrol police was also increased, making the situation more serious. China College has now gone on strike to support Normal University and other colleges.</p>
<p>Peiping, 11th – The preconditions for negotiation between Normal University and the authorities have not been established as of midnight. Normal University students have formed ten volunteer night patrol teams, patrolling the school. Police, security forces, and fire brigades are on high alert outside the school. Telephone communications for all colleges and universities have been cut off.</p>

<p>Su Provincial Education Director Zhou Fo-hai</p>
<h3>Letter to Colleagues in the Education System of Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>A letter from Zhou Fo-hai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, to colleagues in the education system of Jiangsu Province: I have been appointed to head the education system in this province for several months now. I have long known that Jiangsu's culture is the best in the southeast, and its education system is a model for the whole country. I believe that my abilities are limited, and I deeply fear that I will not be able to meet the expectations of the people of Jiangsu. Furthermore, with the treasury empty and the national crisis not yet over, the difficulty of the situation is beyond what I initially expected. Therefore, since taking office, although I have worked diligently day and night and made every effort to plan, I have ultimately been unable to make any significant achievements. However, I am confident that I have always been impartial in dealing with matters and sincere in treating people. Therefore, in the midst of difficulties and challenges, I have received the benefit of assistance and support from gentlemen in the education sector, and I have fortunately avoided criticism for failure. This is something that I am deeply grateful for and will continue to strive for. However, I have silently observed that the education system in Jiangsu has been showing signs of fatigue and decline in recent years. If we do not seek to revitalize it at this time, I fear that there will be no way to salvage it in the future. Therefore, I believe that the education system cannot be controlled by the efforts of one or two officials. Administrative organs occupy a guiding and promoting position, while those who are responsible for molding and shaping character are still the teachers and staff who directly provide education. Only when the two can connect with sincerity, regulate each other with righteousness, and be closely linked, like the response of fingers and arms, can the effectiveness of education be expected. The teachers and staff in Jiangsu are all honest and understanding individuals, and they are already clearly aware of the principles. There is no need for me to repeatedly explain them. However, I usually lack opportunities to contact you all, and I do not want there to be any distance in our intentions. Therefore, I have chosen one or two observations that I have made and offer my humble opinions in the hope of discussing them with you all. (To be continued)</p>

<p>World Games</p>
<h3>Puppet State Participating</h3>
<p>丨Shen Siliang's Sighs丨</p>
<p>Will Telegraph the Committee to Inquire About the Truth</p>
<p>If It Is True, Will Strongly Oppose</p>
<p>Japanese Intrigues Will Involve Many Twists and Turns</p>
<h3>Sports and Diplomacy?</h3>
<p>It was reported yesterday that the puppet state of Manchukuo, through the negotiations of the Japanese delegation, will be allowed to send two athletes to participate in the World Games this autumn. After this shocking news spread, everyone expressed opposition. This reporter specifically visited Shen Siliang, honorary secretary of the National Sports Federation, to obtain his opinion, as follows:</p>
<p>Cannot Use India and the Philippines as Examples - The participation of "Manchukuo" is based on the precedent of India and the Philippines. However, India and the Philippines are dependent countries, but "Manchukuo" is neither a dependent country nor an internationally recognized independent country. What precedent does this follow?</p>
<p>Will Telegraph to Inquire About the Truth - This news has not yet been officially announced by the committee. Since there is this claim, the federation will immediately telegraph the committee to inquire about the truth. If it is true, it will strongly express its opposition to the executive committee of the committee.</p>
<p>Japanese Tricks - The puppet state's request was made by the Japanese on its behalf. The situation is clear at a glance. It is naturally a trick played by the Japanese. There will be many twists and turns in the future. Strong opposition and protests may have little effect. His sighs showed his profound concern.</p>
<p>Cannot Help But Sigh at the Olympics</p>
<h3>Germany's Hopes Are Slim</h3>
<p>Economic Decline Affects Sports</p>
<p>Talent Is Buried, Performance Declines</p>
<p>丨Our Country Is Even Worse Than Them丨</p>
<p>Germany occupies a strong position in the world of sports. This World Games should be full of hope. Unfortunately, the tide of the world economic decline is hitting Germany, and it is at the center of it. Hopes will be greatly affected. It is reported that only nineteen male and female athletes will be sent, and their performance has greatly declined. One can only sigh in frustration.</p>
<p>The Plight of the Sports World - Economic decline has recently created obstacles for sports in Germany. The fear of unemployment has made the number of spectators in European competitions shockingly low. Hopeful athletes in various sports associations are therefore unable to train to the standards of world competitions. Training requires competitions. With fewer spectators, major sports events become wait-and-see affairs. Germans are not as enthusiastic about track and field as they are about boxing and soccer. A sports event requires at least six world-class athletes to attract an audience, and hiring world-renowned performers is not economically feasible.</p>
<p>Hopes Are Weakened - Athletes lack opportunities to test their performance and gain experience in international competitions. This is why hopes for the Olympics this autumn are weak. Although there are many talented young students, there have been good performances in junior sports events, but these can only be considered future hopes. The German Minister of the Interior once tried to reorganize the national sports organizations to seek progress, but the result was abandoned due to economic problems.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Declining Performance - Thus, the discovery of talent can only be obtained by chance. Progress is therefore difficult. Last autumn, the German National Championships were held in Berlin and Magdeburg. The German press unanimously expressed disappointment, with no records broken. A table comparing the records is as follows:</p>
<p>Event  Championship Record German Record World Record</p>
<p>100 Meters 10.8 Seconds 10.4 Seconds 10.3 Seconds</p>
<p>200 Meters 22.2 Seconds 20.9 Seconds 20.6 Seconds</p>
<p>400 Meters 48.4 Seconds 47.8 Seconds 47 Seconds</p>
<p>800 Meters 1 Minute 58.9 Seconds 1 Minute 51.6 Seconds Same as German Record</p>
<p>1500 Meters 3 Minutes 57.6 Seconds 3 Minutes 51 Seconds Same as German Record</p>
<p>5000 Meters 15 Minutes 4.7 Seconds 15 Minutes 28.2 Seconds 14 Minutes 38.2 Seconds</p>
<p>10000 Meters 31 Minutes 59.2 Seconds 31 Minutes 55.2 Seconds 30 Minutes 6.2 Seconds</p>
<p>110 Meters Hurdles 15 Seconds 14.9 Seconds 14.2 Seconds</p>
<p>400 Meters Hurdles 56.1 Seconds 54.8 Seconds 52 Seconds</p>
<p>400 Meters Relay 41.6 Seconds 40.8 Seconds Same as German Record</p>
<p>High Jump  1.86 Meters 1.92 Meters 1.99 Meters</p>
<p>Long Jump  7.47 Meters 7.64 Meters 7.88 Meters</p>
<p>Pole Vault 4.04 Meters 4.05 Meters 4.28 Meters</p>
<p>Shot Put  15.56 Meters 16.04 Meters Same as German Record</p>
<p>Discus  45.48 Meters 48.77 Meters 49.88 Meters</p>
<p>Javelin  63.65 Meters 66.97 Meters 69.93 Meters</p>
<p>Although world records have been broken many times, they have not yet been recognized by the committee.</p>
<p>Hopes Are Just So-So - Tebbe-Yun, who trains in America, is an outstanding talent in the marathon. Koenig and Jonas will compete in the 100-meter and 200-meter races, but there are strong opponents, such as the American veteran Tolan, Wyckoff-Simpson, and South Africa's Jobarde and the British champion Punch. The 400-meter race is another matter. The American William-Twissner, Steele, and Mayer all have scores within 48 seconds, so there may be few opponents. In the 800-meter race, the German veteran Bell's score of 1 minute 51.6 seconds has long been broken by Finland's Nammi and France's Ladoumegue. Even if these two are unable to restore their amateur status by then, Bell must have a better record to compete. It will not be easy to get a position in long-distance, hurdles, or jumping events. However, Hirschvent may be able to surprise in the shot put and discus at the Olympics. Hirsch had an ankle injury a few months ago, but he has now fully recovered. The only hope is Tebbe-Yun in the marathon, who has recently achieved excellent results in America. If he can take good care of himself, he will be a pillar of Germany. As for swimming, it is completely behind. If boxing and rowing are not unlucky, they may not be completely disappointed.</p>

<h3>Record of Striking the Ancient Temple Bell (II) (I)</h3>
<p>Not Removing the Courtyard Grass, Zhai Fu</p>
<p>Twenty-Four</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu went inside, drank a cup of tea, and then said, "Zhong'er! Please take me to see where the school should be set up." I led Mr. Zhu to see the main hall, where the Tathagata Buddha is enshrined. Then we looked at the back hall, and Mr. Zhu suddenly asked, "How come there's a Taishang Laojun in a Buddhist temple? Strange! How did Buddhism and Taoism compromise?" I told him, "The monks added him five years ago because the donations weren't enough to cover expenses. Originally, there was a Zixia Cave about ten miles away from here. All the villagers who believe in Taoism go there to burn incense. When we consecrated the Taishang Laojun here, the monks said triumphantly, 'This profit will no longer leak out.' Indeed, since the Taishang Laojun came, the temple has earned an additional fifty or sixty yuan each year. These monks really know how to do business."... We walked, and soon we arrived at another hall. Mr. Zhu asked, "What are these Bodhisattvas? I recognize the God of Wealth! What are those?" I answered one by one, "This is the Smallpox God, this is the Silkworm God, this is the Ox God." Mr. Zhu said, "I guess all of these are probably employees of the monk boss, right? Which one is the best at doing business?" I said, "That depends on the year. The year before last, there were the most children with smallpox, and the Smallpox God was in luck. Last year, the spring silkworms had a plague, and the Silkworm God's business was even better than the God of Wealth." Mr. Zhu said, "What an interesting shop this is!" I said, "Now that we're going to turn it into a school, we have to move these Bodhisattvas around so that the elementary school students have a place to sit. Elementary school students are our living Bodhisattvas. When they all sit here, the temple will definitely have a new look." Mr. Zhu began to say things that I couldn't understand. He sighed and said, "If you call the elementary school students to sit here one by one, they will also become clay and wood sculptures of Bodhisattvas. Then these children will become the teacher's little helpers, just like the Bodhisattvas doing business for the monks. Won't there be too many Bodhisattvas and too many elementary school students? What kind of medicine is in this gourd?" Mr. Zhu continued to ask, "Is there anywhere else to see?" "No!" was my short reply. Mr. Zhu said again, "A school is like an old ox, and these few rooms are just a hair on the ox's body, just a hair!" I was very anxious in my heart. Mr. Zhu obviously looked down on our ancient temple. I was extremely worried that he wouldn't want to be our teacher here. What, what, what should I do?</p>

<h3>The Way to Preserve Health</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom</p>
<p>The way to preserve health, in a nutshell, is to not destroy one's nature. The destruction of nature begins with the extravagant use of spirit. Spirit needs to be used, but if it is wasted, it will hurt one's vitality.</p>
<p>Eating, dressing, prostitution, and gambling are all manifestations of the extravagant use of spirit. The rushing about, scheming, stirring up trouble, and making waves of bureaucrats and politicians are also nothing more than the extravagant use of spirit. If you want to ask me how to preserve health, I can't say anything profound other than preserving my nature. Hygiene is certainly important, but hygiene is not necessarily able to prolong life.</p>
<p>Confucius was the most particular about hygiene. Confucius was the most particular about diet. He had the strictest dietary conditions. "Food that is spoiled and stale, fish that is rotten, and meat that is spoiled, he does not eat. Food that is discolored, he does not eat. Food that smells bad, he does not eat. Food that is not properly cooked, he does not eat. Food that is not in season, he does not eat." Even "If the meat is not cut properly, he does not eat. If he does not get the right sauce, he does not eat." Confucius was so particular about his diet, but he only lived to be seventy-three years old.</p>
<p>My father lived to be seventy-five, my mother lived to be eighty-nine, and my sister lived to be ninety-three. They were not very particular about their diet, but they all had one unified good habit, which was getting up early. They all had the spirit of the ancients of "rising at the crowing of the rooster."</p>
<p>I have had the habit of getting up early since I was a child. My mother would tell me to recite scriptures and memorize books in the early morning. Sometimes, I would get out of bed and start mumbling scriptures before I even had time to get dressed.</p>
<p>Most people in Shanghai do not have the habit of getting up early, but they used to be very good at getting up early. When I first came to Shanghai, shops had to remove the door panels and open their doors after sunrise, otherwise idlers would come to knock on the door and shout:</p>
<p>I think that now, if you open your shop door at sunrise, people will definitely laugh at you for being crazy.</p>
<h3>Harbin</h3>
<p>— Feng Ji</p>
<p>Since the brutal Japanese occupation of the Three Eastern Provinces, Harbin has become a arena of contention for Japan and Russia. China adheres to a policy of non-resistance, and to this day remains at a loss. However, the righteous army, with surging hot blood, gallops across the land, displaying a spirit of vowing to recover our territory. The importance of Harbin's position is evident. Recounting its recent brief history may be what readers wish to see.</p>
<p>Harbin is a Manchu word. During the Qing Dynasty, it was governed by the Deputy Lieutenant-General of Acheng. Thirty years ago, it was desolate and lonely, merely a village of three to five fishing families.</p>
<p>In the twenty-second year of the Guangxu reign, the Russians demanded that it be opened as a commercial port. For the sake of fostering friendly relations, our country agreed to designate five hundred square li as a Russian concession. The name of Harbin thus became prominent. In less than twenty-five years, it transformed into an important commercial center in East Asia, comparable to Tianjin in the north and Shanghai in the south. The Russians even called it the "St. Petersburg of the East," and some even presumptuously called it Tokyo, regarding the Russian St. Petersburg as the Western capital.</p>
<p>Harbin is located in the center of Manchuria and Mongolia, serving as the key to North Manchuria. Its transportation is convenient, with waterways including the Songhua and Heilong Rivers. Upstream, it sails to Fuyu, Laoshaogou, and other ports; downstream, it passes through Yilan, Fujin, Heihe, and other places, directly reaching the Russian territory of Boli and Miao'erk. By land, it connects to Changchun in the south, linking with the South Manchurian Railway, reaching Japan and Korea. To the east, it reaches Vladivostok; to the north, it connects with the Ussuri Railway, directly reaching Europe via Siberia. With connections in all directions, it is truly an important town in the Far East and a key port in North Manchuria.</p>
<p>The important areas of Harbin are the Daoli and Daowai districts. Daoli was originally called Bazhan, and Daowai was originally called Butou. Because they are separated by the railway, they are referred to as "inner" and "outer." Daowai is entirely a Chinese commercial area, with almost no Russians residing there. Daoli, on the other hand, is purely a Russian commercial district, with some Chinese residents as well. The commercial conditions in the two districts are vastly different, and the municipal management is consequently divided into different levels. However, since the European War, the Russians have been unable to build, and the market is inevitably desolate. There are many hotels, and they are all very clean. Transportation includes automobiles, horse-drawn carriages, and rickshaws. Horse-drawn carriages cost seven or eight jiao per hour, while rickshaws are slightly cheaper. The drivers in Daoli are mostly Russians, with some Chinese as well. If one does not know Russian, it is quite difficult to hire a carriage.</p>
<p>The most bustling street in Daoli is Zhongguo Dajie (Chinese Street), where everything is available. The railway station is not far from Yaopu Jie (Pharmacy Street) in Daoli, and it takes twenty minutes by horse-drawn carriage. There are joint tickets to Beiping, Hankou, Shanghai, Vladivostok, Korea, and Japan. However, to purchase these joint tickets and sleeper tickets, one must pre-order them at the International Bus Ticket Office diagonally opposite the station. These types of joint tickets are not sold at the station.</p>
<h3>On the Seventh Day After Lesser Fullness of Grain in the Ren Shen Year, Accompanying Xuan Ge to Visit the Tomb of Zhu Guwei Zongbo on Holland Road</h3>
<p>— He Chai</p>
<p>The early summer is clear and peaceful, the rain has just cleared. Holland Road is remote, willing to travel together. Still watching the peonies unfold their golden belts, and witnessing the Hibiscus put down its arms. Luxuriant is the fine city, the lyricist is gone. Loud and clear is the old history, the remonstrance rings. (In the Gengzi year, the Duke was a lecturer in the Hanlin Academy, submitting a memorial strongly requesting the suppression of the Boxer bandits.) There is no need to speak of the changes and vanishings of floating clouds. Only wishing to offer a cup during flowering time.</p>
<h3>Tang Duo Ling</h3>
<p>— Xuan Ge</p>
<p>In early summer, accompanying Master He Chai to visit the tomb of Zhu Guwei Zongbo, the soft rain has cleared. The breeze is gentle, the fan is not needed. Quietly, the new green splashes across the suburbs. Passing the late spring is all resentment. Do not forget. It is in the mountain spring. Who recognizes the old frost string? The literary ancestor sleeps underground. Writing autumn lyrics, bleak and desolate Youyan. Heartbroken, the cormorant soars across the sky. The affairs of this world. Are too soaked in suffering.</p>
<h3>One Laughable and Pitiable Incident</h3>
<p>— Gong Yu</p>
<p>Recently, a friend came from another port and told me of an incident that can serve as a valuable lesson for travelers. My friend said, "This time, I came to Shanghai by train. When boarding, the passengers were not very crowded. There was a young woman with a beautiful appearance and particularly luxurious and fashionable attire. She boarded at the same time as me, and our seats were also close. There were few passengers in the car, and even fewer women. The young, fashionable woman was the only beautiful one, so the passengers all stared at her, making her the center of attention. However, she remained calm and composed, showing no shyness at all. She must have received a school education or be what is called a modern girl. Soon after, the train arrived at a station, and several passengers boarded, filling the empty seats. Before long, it arrived at a major station, and even more passengers boarded and disembarked. The car immediately felt crowded. A young man in a Western suit, carrying a leather bag, boarded the train and looked around, seeing that there were no empty seats. He showed a slight look of displeasure, but then he was delighted and went straight to the woman. She was taking up a lot of space, and others may have thought that she was a young, fashionable woman and felt ashamed of their own appearance, not wanting to squeeze next to her, so they let her be. This young man's psychology was completely opposite, and he took pleasure in sitting next to a beautiful woman, so he went straight to squeeze for a seat. At first, the woman felt very comfortable taking up more than one seat, but when the young man sat down, she felt it was too narrow, as if they were a related pair. After several more stops, passengers got on and off at each stop. Few people who had originally seen the woman board alone remained. Those who boarded later saw the woman and the young man sitting side by side, and many mistakenly thought they were a loving couple or lovers. However, I never changed my seat and watched coldly from the sidelines, knowing everything clearly. Suddenly, I heard the two of them chatting intimately, and I was very surprised. I secretly thought that the so-called social openness of modern times, which eliminates the boundaries between men and women, was indeed like this. Then, the train arrived at another station and stopped abruptly. Of course, passengers got on and off. The woman stood up and leaned against the window, watching the scenery outside. The young man also stood up, placing one hand on her shoulder, acting even more like a married couple. Suddenly, the woman exclaimed, "Oh no! What should I do?" The young man quickly asked what was wrong. The woman said that the diamond hairpin inserted in her hair had suddenly fallen outside the train. There were many pedestrians, and it would soon be picked up by someone else. What to do? What to do? The young man leaned out the window and looked. Indeed, it was there. So he bravely said, "You stay here and watch it. Let me get off the train to pick it up." With that, he hurriedly"</p>
<h3>On Thrifty Frugality to Save the Nation (9)</h3>
<p>— Narrated by Nie Zengjifen, Written by Son Qijie</p>
<p>The situation at that time was very similar to today. The lamentations of Guan and Meng, and the weeping of Cao Sheng, all stemmed from this. Gathering a large number of people who value profit over righteousness and lack integrity, even if you save them with ten times the military equipment of Europe and America, they will only harm themselves and provide resources to the enemy. On the contrary, if you can practice the teachings of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, then acts of greed, evil, filth, and inferiority will not be tolerated by public opinion, which is more powerful than the punishment of the law. The habit of extravagance and deceit will be abandoned by society, and its effects will be more effective than the restrictions of political decrees. In this way, people will have a barrier in their hearts for defense and protection. Merchants will not covet foreign goods and sell them for profit, and citizens will not covet the exquisite and convenient imported goods and buy them. This is truly a method of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields. Today, the financial panic in various countries shows signs of imminent collapse. Countries that rely on military force to dominate and economic aggression are likely to collapse sooner or later. Those that temporarily avoid collapse do so by using the resources and wealth seized from the countries they have invaded. For example, our country spends a huge amount of 200,000 million yuan each year on foreign goods, at least half of which is used to supply the enemy's army, navy, and air force, as well as materials for bombs and weapons. Everyone is unwilling to bear the infamous name of providing money to the enemy, but this is actually happening, driven by desires. These are the Han traitors and national sellouts in our hearts. If everyone can remove the thieves in their hearts, then all the enemy's instruments of aggression will be useless. At that time, people in all countries will also realize the goodness of this method and quickly imitate it, removing their extravagant habits, abolishing their useless industries, and reducing their suicidal military preparations. They will return to simplicity and foster good neighborly relations. World peace can be achieved easily, and the key lies in each individual's self-discipline and control of desires. If desires do not stop for a day, then the enemy's source of supplies will not be exhausted for a day, and the war will not stop for a day. The impact of individual desires on world order and chaos is so great.</p>
<p>"got off the train. At that time, I was also worried about the woman, watching her fallen hairpin intently, as if I was helping her watch it to prevent it from being picked up by someone else. After the young man picked it up, he hurriedly got back on the train, revealing a smug look. However, after getting on the train, his expression suddenly changed to one of panic, looking around as if he couldn't find a seat when he first boarded the train. I was puzzled at first, but then I realized that the woman was gone. Only then did I understand the young man's panic. The young man searched up and down in his original seat for a long time, his face becoming increasingly pale and dejected. A neighbor asked him what was wrong. The young man said, "I lost a leather bag, which contained important documents and 3,000 yuan in cash. The value of the documents is ten times that of the cash. Have any of you seen it?" The neighbor said, "Why are you so panicked? This leather bag is still in the hands of your family member and went off the train with you. Why did you get back on the train alone?" The young man didn't understand at first, but then he realized and couldn't help stomping his feet and saying, "I made a mistake! I made a mistake! She's not my family member and I've never met her before. I only met her on the train." The neighbor still didn't understand, but I understood everything clearly and found the young man both laughable and pitiable."</p>
<h3>Eating Meat Is Not As Good As Eating Fish</h3>
<p>— Shou Zhen</p>
<p>Scientists have studied various meats and their nutritional value, and have determined that fish is quite high in value. Fish can provide the vitamins and minerals needed for a healthy life. Fish contains oil, minerals, and protein in no less quantity than meat.</p>
<p>Fish are particularly rich in minerals: magnesium, sodium, potassium, iodine, mineral yellow, green gas, etc. Fish oil, especially cod liver oil, is rich in vitamins A and B. Fish roe is full of vitamin A.</p>
<p>Fish protein is especially beneficial for physical development and health. Recently, scientists' interest has focused on the study of its iodine content. Because foods rich in iodine can prevent throat diseases.</p>
<p>The amount of iodine contained in various types of fish varies. Crab is the least, shrimp is the most, while scallops and clams are in between. Generally, saltwater fish are richer in iodine.</p>
<p>The American Public Health Research Committee has studied fish in detail. Their conclusion: both fish and shellfish are good foods. First, they are nutritious and easy to digest. Oil, minerals, protein, and sometimes a large amount of vitamins—everything is available. Second, they are inexpensive and convenient for the common people.</p>

<h3>Record of Dual Life in War and Peace (77)</h3>
<p>— The Owner of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 9: A Special Train Evicts Guests, Causing False Alarms; Sitting Cold in the Yamen, Petrification Becomes a Distant Thought</p>
<p>An Yutian, restless in his stillness, secretly thought that he had not yet met with Ye Zuozhang. Why not go directly to the yamen to visit him? He completely forgot Liang Xiaoyun's instructions and hired a car to go by himself. Relying on the fact that Little Mao had obtained a badge for him a few days ago, he hung it on the lapel of his mandarin jacket and swaggered into the yamen, searching for the Correspondence Office. Stepping inside, he saw a large reception hall filled with people of all kinds. Some were wearing military uniforms, some were in civilian clothes, some were old, some were young, some were foreigners with yellow hair and blue eyes, and there were even monks. It was like a human exhibition hall. He found an empty chair and sat down, but for a long time, no one paid attention to him. No cup of tea or cigarette was offered. Then he saw an armed military officer with the rank of major walking out of a dark room inside, holding a large handful of business cards in his hand, flipping them over and over in his palm like shuffling poker cards. People sitting nearby took their business cards and bowed and smiled at him. He guessed that this must be the correspondence officer in charge of communication, so he took out a business card with his official title printed on it, walked over, and handed it to him, saying very humbly, "Excuse me, I'm here to see the Military Governor. Please inform him." The correspondence officer rolled his eyes, looked him and his business card all over, and hummed slightly from his seemingly cold nose, "Wait a moment," and then swaggered away. He was ordered to sit back and wait. Outside, new people continued to arrive in groups, but some were arrogant and very familiar, not asking where to sit when they entered the door, but going straight to the door of the inner room, lifting the white cloth curtain, and shouting loudly, "Chief" or "Brother." Then the correspondence officer came back in, shouting, "Please come, so-and-so, please come, so-and-so." Eight or nine out of ten were those who were very familiar with the people in the inner room, and they happily agreed, following the correspondence officer out in batches. The people sitting outside were rarely called, only watching others go in and out like a revolving lantern, and still had to sit upright and quietly, waiting for their turn. This wait lasted for more than four hours. An Yutian desperately finished a pack of cigarettes, only making his lips dry and his heart restless, his legs sore and his waist aching, and his hunger and thirst intensifying, but he could not get any accurate information about whether he would be seen or not, and he could not just leave. He couldn't help thinking to himself, "Am I going to be imprisoned again?" If I continue to sit and wait like this, it will not be difficult to turn my body into a natural fossil. When will this crime be over? Let's wait for the next chapter to explain.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Gold Price</h3>
<p>Rose by Nine Taels and One Qian</p>
<p>No significant fluctuations. Last week, the standard gold price tended to be firm again, but there were no major fluctuations. The daily fluctuations were only four or five taels, with a maximum of eight taels. There were no important overseas news. The price fell from the beginning of the week, opening at 712.5 taels. Due to the impact of the continued rise in the silver market, it eventually saw a low price of 711.8 qian. However, there was talk that the Central Bank would transport cash for export, and the price then rose. However, the US silver price reported a fall, and the exchange rate trended lower, especially with the exhaustion of cash and the Central Bank absorbing it. As a result, the market price advanced and broke through 700 taels. By Wednesday, due to the traditional Dragon Boat Festival, there was a holiday. Then, with the swap date approaching, various parties planned to push the price up significantly, estimating 10 taels. However, according to the US dollar rate, the July to August swap should be a discount of 25 (equivalent to 6 taels). This made the shorts fearful and they covered their positions, reaching a maximum of 729 taels on Friday. However, the price then reacted slightly as sellers seemed to be active. The closing price on Saturday was 724.8 taels, an increase of 9.1 qian compared to the previous Saturday. The total review of the gold week was a gain of 17.2 qian. As for the overseas silver market, the British price was flat and the US price fell. The exchange rate calculated that the British rate against the US rate fell by 1.875 points, and the US rate against the British rate rose by 0.125 points. As a result, the Shanghai HSBC listing calculated that the British gold price was flat and the US gold price decreased slightly. Internally, the British gold price was flat, and the US gold price decreased recently by 1.875, and forward by 3.125. This was really due to the exchange rate relationship. Gold firms covered their recent positions and sold their forward positions, sometimes hedging with strips. However, the settlement price was around 70 taels. According to the exchange, the total number of suspicious codes was 23,200. Various firms such as Wanxing Shunli and the Dalian gang still accounted for most of the long positions. Qian Changxiang actually had more than 5,000, and Yifeng Yong also had more than 3,000. Yuanxing Yongbing Xing and others were also the same. The Guangdong gang had only a few more. The shorts included Yuan Mao Yong, Dade Cheng, and each had more than 2,000. The rest were mostly retail customers. The following is a summary of the situation over the week.</p>
<p>Review of the peaceful five days (Monday): The big strip of silver continued to rise by 0.0625, the US silver price rose by 0.25, and the exchange rate was flat, so the initial US dollar listing was unchanged, and the internal price was also flat. The standard gold price initially opened down by 3.2 qian, at 712.5 taels, and then by 13.5 qian. However, there were many sellers, and the price eventually fell to 711.8 qian. Soon after, news came that the Central Bank was shipping cash out, and the market improved immediately. Buyers were aggressive, pushing the price up to 19.6 qian, but it soon retreated to 16.6 qian. Sellers were also active, and the price closed at 17.4 qian at noon. The afternoon opened at 16.7 qian, and the Guangdong gang entered, pushing the price to 18.8 qian. The price closed at 18 taels, an increase of 2.3 qian compared to the previous Saturday. The situation was complex, rising and falling, with a fluctuation of 7.8 qian throughout the day. Fuyu Hengyu Zhifeng Yong and a Mr. Wu followed the price up.</p>
<p>(Tuesday): The big strip was unchanged, the silver price was down, the initial listing was the same as before, and the internal British price was firm and the US price was soft, so the exchange rate was slightly lower.

<p>(Thursday): The recent big strip frequently rose by 0.0625, the forward price was unchanged, the US silver price was the same as before, and the initial listing was unchanged. However, the US dollar rate fell by 0.125. The internal British price was flat and the US price seemed firm. The gold market initially opened up 3.2 qian, at 23.8 qian.

<h3>Discount Rates Continue to Fall, Call Loan Rates Trend Higher</h3>
<p>Sunday Market Quiet</p>

The morning price was 6 qian 9 fen 1 li and a half, and the afternoon price was 6 qian 9 fen 1 li. The result was still a decrease of 1 li and a half compared to the morning price of the previous day. The weakness of the trend still did not diminish slightly.

<h3>Last Week's Bond Market Sluggish</h3>
<p>Volume of Transactions: 17.5 Million</p>
<p>The bond market situation at the local Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange last week (from June 6th to 11th) was as follows: except for Wednesday, when the market was closed for the Dragon Boat Festival, trading proceeded as usual on the remaining days. Trading activity was subdued. Futures trading amounted to 17,570,000 yuan, a decrease of approximately 10,090,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Spot trading was also scarce, with a total turnover of 195,000 yuan for the entire week. As for the price trends of various bonds, the overall situation was dull. There were no new developments in domestic and international affairs. Major investors remained cautious, supply and demand were balanced, and prices did not fluctuate significantly. Furthermore, since the war, various industries in the local area have not been able to recover easily, the market is sluggish, and finances are stagnant. With the end of the previous settlement period approaching, various businesses needed to finalize their accounts. Although there were still those investing and receiving income, most adopted a cautious attitude and there were no large-scale transactions. Consequently, supply exceeded demand, and prices fluctuated and declined, but the trend remained relatively stable, with daily fluctuations of only a few cents. As a result, compared to the previous week, only the Reorganization Surtax Bond experienced a minor increase of about half a yuan, while most others fell by one to 1.67 yuan. Only the Series 20 Salt Tax Bond showed a significant decline of about one yuan for the next month's delivery. Observing the current environment, one feels a sense of stagnation. If the overall situation does not improve significantly in the short term, the future will become even more desolate, and a turnaround is unlikely. Therefore, before the end of the previous settlement period, there is little hope for development in the bond market. The following table lists the price highs, lows, and fluctuations of various bonds during the past week (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Panic Selling by Nervous Investors</p>
<h3>Last Week's Yarn Market Trending Soft</h3>
<p>Gloomy Global Trends, Few Reasons for Optimism</p>
<p>The long-brewing yarn market suddenly showed cracks last week, with the market trending towards softness. A decline had been possible for some time. Due to the thin local inventory and the continuous, albeit small, demand for spot yarn in the south, bulls held on tightly. However, overseas cotton yarn conditions became increasingly unstable, with American cotton breaking through the five-cent barrier. Domestically, social and economic bankruptcies and rural decline were frequently reported, raising concerns about future yarn sales. This triggered panic among investors, leading to a flood of new selling. Consequently, the market downturn intensified. Some, however, still believed the base was small and remained bullish. Yet, global prices are plummeting, making it difficult for local yarn to remain stable compared to foreign yarn. The high price of local yarn in the past was due to certain reasons. Recently, the cost of raw materials has become extremely low, reducing the cost of cotton yarn itself. Therefore, the situation is vastly different. Japanese merchants are aggressively selling yarn in all directions, reportedly at exceptionally low prices with profit margins still available. As a result, North China is flooded with their products, leaving local yarn with little hope. With the low cost of raw materials, local factories are eager to sell to compete. Some manufacturers are reportedly struggling with inventory. There are also reports that the clearance of Tianjin local yarn is sluggish, with some planning to ship it to Shanghai to find a way out. This demonstrates the immature business strategies of local factories. In conclusion, the global trends are grim, with few reasons for optimism. According to statistics, during the past week, various groups purchased a total of 3,415 bales of spot yarn, with 307 bales traded among peers. Prices were 3-4 liang lower than the previous week. Large investors were selling standard yarn, and bulls were liquidating. Prices for various months were 4 liang 7, 8, and 9 qian lower than the previous week. The total transaction volume for the week was 120,950 bales. The following is a breakdown of the amount purchased by each group:</p>
<p>Group    Bales  Group   Bales   Group   Bales</p>
<p>Sichuan 265   Hankou  10   Qingdao 25</p>
<p>Luzhou  10   Inland  467   Changsha 150</p>

<p>The following is a breakdown of the high and low prices for the 20-count "Ren Biao" yarn for the week:</p>

<p>July   155.0   148.5   148.3   Decrease 4.5</p>

<p>Amidst the Global Cotton Market's Plunge</p>
<h3>Last Week's Cotton Market Extremely Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton market was quite unstable last week, with a sharp decline. The global cotton market was plunging, and American cotton reached a new low not seen in a century, breaking through the five-cent barrier. This triggered widespread panic. Shanghai trading houses were selling American cotton, middling grade, at 27 liang, with a rebate of one liang. The larger the quantity, the lower the price. However, factories, seeing the unfavorable trend, were unwilling to absorb it, resulting in no transactions. This cotton could be used to produce 20-count yarn. As news spread, anxiety increased in the market. Large investors were selling, causing the market to decline significantly. However, Shanghai cotton merchants generally believed that 29 liang for standard cotton was cheap, as such a price had not been seen for years, and they considered it a good buying opportunity. Therefore, they were purchasing daily. However, the low price of American cotton and global prices were unprecedented. (Eleventh, Tokyo Dispatch from Telegraph Agency) According to information obtained by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the American cotton market has been gradually declining due to favorable weather in the cotton-producing areas and political instability before the general election. The July contract has plummeted to a new low of over four cents. The authorities in Texas estimate that the carryover of old cotton on August 1st will increase by around 13 million bales. Moreover, cotton-producing countries also expect an increase in production this year, which will significantly reduce the sales of American cotton. They predict that American cotton will fall to over one cent this fall (i.e., over two fen). Predicting prices to fall below two fen seems excessively low. Overall, observing the general trend, there is little reason for optimism. Compared to the situation of foreign cotton, how can local cotton stand? It is said that there are sufficient stocks in the northern region, and a large amount has not yet been shipped out. It is difficult to predict the future of standard cotton. The price of standard cotton fell by 1 liang 89 qian in a week. The total transaction volume for the week was 200,500 dan. The amount of Yao flower cotton arriving at the docks was 2,770 bales, and Tong flower cotton was 150 bales. The following is a breakdown of the amount of spot cotton purchased by each factory:</p>
<p>Cotton Type High Price Low Price  Transaction Volume Deadline</p>
<p>Tianjin Flower 28.00 ...  100 pieces Delivery to factories</p>
<p>Yuyao Flower 28.00 17.75 1,300 pieces Delivery to factories</p>
<p>Donggou Flower 29.50 ...  100 bales  Delivery to factories</p>
<p>The following records the high and low prices of Zheng Standard cotton for the week:</p>
<p>Ren Biao  Highest  Lowest  Week-end Price Compared to Last Week</p>
<p>July   30.85 28.75 18.90 Decrease 1.85</p>
<p>August  31.25 28.90 29.00  3.10</p>

<p>November 31.55 29.80  9.95  15.0</p>
<h3>Recovery of the Weakness of American Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to poor weather, but then weakened due to bull liquidation and sales in New Orleans. Futures fell by 5 to 8 points, and spot fell by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 2-3 points, and spot rose by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 5 points. Indian cotton market closed. Original telegram recorded on the left (11th report).</p>

<p>Silk and Tea: The Overseas Chinese Silk Market Last Week</p>
<h3>Filled with a Chorus of Declines</h3>
<p>Frequently Showing Unprecedented New Low Prices</p>
<p>During the past week, the local foreign trading houses' silk market has fallen into despair. Since the economic decline in Europe and America, silk weaving factories have heavily used rayon in order to reduce costs, leading to a significant decrease in the consumption of raw silk. Although Japanese silk merchants have lowered prices in an attempt to sell old silk, there is insufficient demand, and there is still no hope for a turnaround in silk sales. Local silk follows the downward trend of Japanese silk, and the decline has not weakened. New lows, unprecedented in history, have repeatedly appeared. Factories still experience activity without sales. Wires from Shanghai still show little turning towards Shanghai. The futures and spot silk markets continued to be quiet during the week. Manufacturers have 30,000 to 40,000 bales of old silk in their hands, but there is no way to sell them. New silks from Jiangsu and Zhejiang have already been shipped to Shanghai. Only one-tenth of the silk factories in the city have started operating, and most are reeling old cocoons for customers. New silk has not been released, and the market is stagnant. There is no hope for improvement in silk sales in the short term. Last week, overseas Chinese silk prices were filled with a chorus of declines. There were daily transactions without sales, making it scarcely worth recording.</p>
<h3>Pongee and Oiled Cloth Raincoats Enjoy Temporary Boom</h3>
<p>The pongee and oiled cloth market has been increasing steadily in recent years. Sales were even better during the early spring season. As the rainy season is approaching, sales are even more brisk. Each week, foreign firms are shipping around 20 pieces. However, market prices remain weak and declining. This is because there is too much supply. Oiled cloth raincoats are currently the most popular item. As a result, sales have been particularly widespread. They are very popular in Shanghai, and most Western-style raincoats are made from this material. Yesterday, wholesale prices for local goods were 1 yuan, 2 liang, and 7 qian 5 fen per yard. (Last year, when it first arrived in Shanghai, it was sold for 3 liang 8 and 9 qian). Purple-brown and brown are more popular than gray. All the large and small Western clothing stores in the local area have purchased them.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Slightly Decline</h3>
<p>Over 300 Bags of Local Hui'an White Sugar Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading at the sugar market was relatively quiet, with both buying and selling being sluggish. Dutch sugar #24 raw sugar and white sugar were traded at 13 liang 9 qian 5 fen, with few buyers. The market trend was slightly lower than before. Medium-grade white sugar was in short supply and firm, but trading was also weak. Dutch Red #9 was quite popular at 9 liang 9 qian. Lower grade #8 goods were sold at 9 liang 6 qian 5 fen by Dachang. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 16 liang 2 qian 5 fen, and CW mark was 15 liang 9 qian, with a firm trend, but trading was less. Lower grades such as DY mark were in strong demand due to market shortages. However, the company's pricing was relatively high, leading to a stalemate and no transactions. In addition, over 300 bags of Hui'an top-grade white sugar arrived yesterday from Guangbang Zhichengxing, opening at 13 liang 5 qian. There were many buyers, and the inventory was quickly cleared. This sugar is a famous local product of eastern Guangdong, with a rich fragrance and very strong sugar content.</p>
<p>It is different from imported products. Unfortunately, there were not many goods arriving, and buyers were very active, so the market trend was exceptionally strong. Also, Hainan red sugar also opened at over 200 bags yesterday, priced at 9 liang 4 qian, up 2 qian from before. This sugar has a delicate yellow color, and its quality is even better than foreign sugar. The company currently has inventory and is willing to sell at 9 liang 8 qian.</p>
<h3>Seaweed and Shrimp: Thriving Sales of Fresh Yangsheng</h3>
<p>First Harvest of 8,000 Dan... Market Prices Decline</p>
<p>The new spring seaweed and shrimp have been thriving. Fishing boats setting sail from places such as Qushan, Daishan, Zhoushan, and Luohua in Ningbo are returning fully loaded. It is estimated that the total amount collected from various mountains has reached 8,000 dan. Moreover, there is still a second harvest to be had. If the weather is sunny and the fish schools do not disperse, it would not be surprising to collect another 3,000 to 4,000 dan. Such abundance is rare. Last year's total was only 5,600 to 5,700 dan, so this year's amount is more than double. Therefore, fishermen are beaming with joy. However, with so much supply, prices are declining. Yesterday, top-grade goods were sold at 28 liang, and ordinary goods were sold at 27 liang to 26 liang. Buyers from other regions were unenthusiastic, and local traders were unwilling to hold large inventories. Therefore, prices may continue to weaken.</p>

<h3>Special Tribunal for Punishing Corruption</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beijing the day before yesterday stated that the Ministry of Justice is drafting regulations for punishing corruption and organizational rules for the special tribunal. Once the draft is completed, it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval and promulgation.</p>
<p>Under this honest and clean government, there should no longer be corrupt officials who embezzle and pervert the law. However, in recent years, looking at the various ministries and agencies, there is no evidence of virtuous governance. Instead, we hear that someone bought a large Western-style house as a residence, someone else bought a large garden as a villa, someone recently married a beautiful wife, and someone else took in a seductive concubine. I cannot understand where such vast sums of money come from to support their extravagant and luxurious lives under this clean government. This is a significant point of suspicion.</p>
<p>"Punishing those who steal hooks but making lords of those who steal countries" has been the traditional policy in Chinese politics. Now, with the establishment of a special court to punish corruption, it is naturally a misfortune for a few hook-stealing fellows. However, hook-stealers are everywhere, and punishing them is endless and futile. In the end, it will only be another pro forma article, "Killing a chicken to scare the monkeys." Otherwise, they will be placed in a position beyond the law, and the so-called "swans fly into the dark, how can the archer catch them?"</p>
<p>Therefore, it is said that the law cannot be enforced if those above violate it.</p>

<h3>Impromptu Poem on Hearing of Commander-in-Chief Chiang's Visit to Mount Luofu</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianmin</p>
<p>Your military might shakes the nine provinces,</p>
<p>To serve the country, what more could one seek?</p>
<p>Since Yue Fei, loyal and true,</p>
<p>You are the foremost general, unique.</p>
<p>You gracefully retreat to Luofu's peak,</p>
<p>Resembling Qi Wang's lakeside quest.</p>
<p>With the nation unsettled, you yearn to hide,</p>
<p>Deep sorrow in your heart, sorely pressed.</p>
<p>Your moral integrity, a century submerged,</p>
<p>Who will raise hearts from the depths of disgrace?</p>
<p>You alone uphold virtue's banner high,</p>
<p>In wind and rain, like a rooster crowing, admired by all.</p>
<h3>Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>— Ning Mogu</p>
<p>Let's talk about the abandoned affairs of the past,</p>
<p>Festival greetings still for kowtowing worms.</p>
<p>The situation has long been like rats in a temple,</p>
<p>Where in the Central Plains are there no sorrowful geese?</p>
<p>Where is the power of the tiger painted on the mugwort sprig?</p>
<p>The silkworm's shriveled form still resembles its state.</p>
<p>Unwrapping the zongzi reveals a bullish trend,</p>
<p>The wind of falling plum blossoms reported again in Jiangcheng.</p>

<h3>Talking About Wireless</h3>
<p>— Ding Zhuzhong</p>
<p>"Wireless" is the abbreviation for "wireless telegraph," "wireless telephone," and "wireless imaging." To understand the advantages of "wireless," one must first understand the disadvantages of "wired telegraph" and "wired telephone":</p>
<p>(1) When the distance between two places is too great, the cost of wires and poles is too high. Submarine cables between East Asia and Europe and America cost millions of dollars per line.</p>
<p>(2) Inspecting wires and poles is extremely inconvenient, especially for submarine cables. A submarine cable across the Atlantic Ocean was laid between Ireland and Newfoundland in 1865, but it broke and was lost before it could be completed. It took many years to find it.</p>
<p>(3) Aircraft in the air and ships at sea cannot be equipped with fixed wires, so they cannot communicate with various places, especially in times of danger, when it is simply impossible to call for help.</p>
<p>(4) The inhumane wars in the world often aim to cut off the enemy's wires. All other undertakings are bound to be greatly affected.</p>
<p>(5) The length of the wire and the size of the electrical energy are inversely proportional. The longer the wire, the smaller the electrical energy. Therefore, telephones cannot reach when the distance between two places is too great.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate these shortcomings and contribute the most economical and effective products to mankind, scientists have continued to work hard to improve them. Sure enough, on December 12, 1901, science released a surprising light: Marconi received a telegram from the United States in England. This telegram, which crossed the Atlantic Ocean, was not transmitted using wires. There were no overhead wires on land, and no submarine cables in the water.</p>
<p>Marconi was an Italian, and he could not get experimental funding in his own country, so he went to England. In 1894, he received funding from the British Telegraph Bureau and began experimenting with "wireless telegraph." In 1896, he successfully experimented, but could only communicate over a distance of 1 and 3/4 miles (about 5 li). By 189, British warships could communicate over a distance of 85 miles (about 240 li). Later, he worked hard to improve the communication distance gradually increased, eventually enabling "wireless telegraph" to reach the globe.</p>
<p>He further sought improvement in "wireless telegraph" and successfully experimented with "wireless telephone" in 1908. Since 1918, due to the invention of the vacuum tube (i.e., the light bulb on the wireless radio), "wireless"</p>
<p>progressed rapidly. Therefore, "wireless telephone" can broadcast beautiful music or speeches by famous people to the world, so that people around the world can listen through radios, as if they were gathered in the same room.</p>
<p>The American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Western Electric Company worked together to invent "telephotography" and successfully experimented with it in 1925. This involves using changes in electric current to transmit images of people or other objects or calligraphy from one place to another. For example, in May 1926, Americans transmitted photos from Ohio to New York. However, the transmission between the two places was done using wires. In July 1927, the French invented "wireless telephotography," which, like wireless telegraph and telephone, eliminated the wires used to transmit electricity between the two places. Modern scientists are competing to research and develop, with very significant results.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, all the sounds and images in the world cannot be blocked by mountains and rivers after all. The ancient sayings "thousand-mile eyes, smooth-sailing ears" have now been confirmed by science.</p>
<p>Learning to Write and Sketch</p>
<h3>Such a School</h3>
<p>— Iwano</p>
<p>Old Wang had been eating the rice of the south for more than ten years, but he was still so poor that his family was destitute. He thought that if things continued like this, he wouldn't be able to support his family, let alone himself. He saw that the sound of chanting and singing was endless in the alleys and neighborhoods of Shanghai, and he thought that opening a school would be a good business. Once he made up his mind, he figured out a way to raise 200 gold coins, rented a single building in a small alley, and lived with his wife and children in a pavilion upstairs. The upstairs was rented out to others, and the downstairs living room was used as a classroom. He got more than a dozen desks and chairs, a blackboard, bought a bell, and bought a few paper national flags to hang in the air. It looked very much like a school. The lead school sign had already been hung at the door, and recruitment advertisements had also been posted. Children with snotty noses from various neighborhoods came in droves, and the classroom was full. Old Wang naturally smiled when he saw this.</p>
<p>From then on, Old Wang began to play his role as the Monkey King and sing his solo performance. The big dog barks, the little dog jumps, and he taught them in a clear and loud voice. After teaching for a few days, he felt that it was inconvenient for one class to be taught while the others did nothing and disturbed the classroom. So he came up with a brilliant idea, which was to drive all the people who were not being taught to play in the five-foot-square patio. The whole school was divided into three classes. The first half of the day was three lessons, and it just so happened that each class had one lesson. Chen Ping cut meat, and nothing could be more even than that. The second half of the day was the same. After a week, he felt that this method was not good, because the noise from the patio would often enter through the windows, making the people in the classroom uneasy. He then pondered a way to improve it, and as a result, he came up with another brilliant idea, which was to have everyone come in and sit down. Those who were being taught listened to the teacher, and those who were not being taught wrote. From then on, it was indeed much quieter. He was very satisfied with this teaching method, and he often boasted to others about it.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, a bare-footed child with snot running down his face said to him, "Teacher! My dad told me to ask you, why do other schools teach arithmetic, but we don't have it here?"</p>
<p>This reminded Old Wang. That's right, new-style reading cannot be without arithmetic, but I haven't learned it, so how can I teach it? He thought for a long time, and then replied to the child with a stern voice, "Who said we don't have it? We'll teach it in a few days!" That night, he went to buy an arithmetic book for the first grade of elementary school, studied it hard, and after five nights of hard work, he was able to write the formula one plus one equals two, and five minus three equals two. Once he fully understood these, he immediately passed them on to the students. All three classes of students were taught addition and subtraction. The students who had already learned it were given a few more questions on the blackboard to do, saying that elementary school just needed to know addition and subtraction. As long as they did it a lot, did it quickly, and were familiar with it, they would benefit from it for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>A month later, he was asked by the students to teach singing. He thought that singing was also indispensable in new-style reading, and he also thought that learning to box at the age of sixty, this "獨來米沙" could not be learned for a while. Fortunately, he had a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old nephew who was studying in the fourth grade of elementary school, so he pulled him in to teach for two hours a week. From then on, in his school, there was Chinese, there was writing, there was singing, and there was addition and subtraction. He felt even more that he was a new-style school.</p>
<p>His school has been open for almost a year now, and he still adheres to this teaching method. I am also paying attention to whether there will be any better methods in the future. If there are any new discoveries, I will not hesitate to use my ink and pen, and I will not hesitate to use the space of this magazine to inform readers, so that those who revise the history of education in Shanghai can also get more information.</p>
<h3>A Complaint Uttered from a Pigeon Cage</h3>
<p>— Manqian</p>
<p>Since the invasion of Shanghai by the brutal Japanese, and the subsequent destruction of schools, after relocating to Shanghai to resume classes, our dormitory is a two-story Western-style building rented for us by the school. Counting the small rooms, living rooms, and side rooms, there are less than five rooms in total. Furthermore, the living room has been converted into a dining hall. Naturally, seventy or eighty people live here, crammed together like sardines in a can.</p>
<p>In the past, when the weather was cooler, being crowded was bearable, but now the weather is getting hotter every day. A dozen or twenty people crammed together emanate waves of sweaty odor, penetrating directly into our nostrils. In addition, we all sleep on the floor, rendering mosquito nets ineffective. Consequently, mosquitoes and gnats reign supreme at night, preventing a good night's sleep. Therefore, classrooms, balconies, and rooftops have gradually become our colonies. Although it is troublesome to roll up our bedding early and spread it out late, it is much better than being crammed together.</p>
<p>As for the classrooms, they are in rented houses nearby. The classrooms are only half the size of normal ones. Shanghai's air is already polluted, and with thirty or forty people breathing in one room, the discomfort inside is unimaginable. Sometimes it is so stifling that almost the entire class is yawning and wanting to sleep. Moreover, the incessant hawking of vendors outside the door makes it impossible to concentrate on our books.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the most difficult problem to solve is that of excretion. Originally, the house had two flushing toilets, but for some reason, one is broken. Therefore, the remaining one has to serve seventy or eighty people, which is clearly insufficient. If one suddenly needs to defecate urgently or has diarrhea, there is truly no solution.</p>
<p>The various situations are too numerous to fully describe. In short, under this kind of living condition, everything gives us a great sense of unease. Ah, tracing it to its root, this gift from the brutal Japanese is truly unforgettable.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: If the facts in this article are indeed true, we implore the landlords of the school to show some conscience and not treat the students like pigs.</p>
