<p>潮州旅滬同鄉會、四育救國團德育組、昨日特請中委潘雲超先生、於同鄉會塲、作公開演講會於下午四時舉行、計到會員三百餘人、首由主席鄭正秋君致介紹詞、略謂、本團德育組、本有演講規定、惟因天時災熱、擬待秋凉舉行、但思東北義勇軍、在此夏日可畏之時、冒暑與暴日抵抗、誓以熱血洗盡國恥、争回失地、我們處此國家多難、自問何敢畏熱、所以特提早舉行、潘雲超先生道德文章、素爲我同鄉景仰、此次受朱霽青先生委託、主持東北救國軍後方事務、對於東北情形、必深熟諳我同鄉尤望其能賜告東北最近之狀况也、云云、次由潘超雲先生演講、（辭長另録）復次、由鄭正秋翁子光等、相繼演説詞多勗勉之詞、至六時許始行散會云、以下爲潘氏演詞、</p>
<p>請君、關於東北事項、貴會曾熱心援助此兄弟在未講之先、須表示十分謝忱的、今日蒙貴會招請演講東北問題、以如此嚴重和複雜的東北、兄弟知者很少、不能多所貢獻、甚覺包歉、兹僅扼要言之、東北事件關係國際甚大、日本蘇俄以至美國、甚爲複雜、在極短期間、不有盡言、今先就日本的陰謀、説一説、數十年之前、日本有一黑龍會之組織、會内的份子、有政容·有軍人·有政治家·有流氓、他的唯一原則、就是侵略中國、非僅軍事經濟方面、拼採各種方法、極盡侵略之能事、利用政府心理、抓住社會弱點、所以每次的内戰背景、必有一方有日人在背後操縱、所以中國歷來許多内亂、政治不上軌道、社會這般混亂、直接間接、無非受日人的影響、此次侵佔東北、我們早知其爲一貫的計劃、他們整個主張、就是破壞中國以至吞併中國、此應認識者一、日本侵佔東北、目的非僅東北、實在黃河以北一帶、猶之從前侵佔高麗、目的實在東北一般、不過他爲何不早早出此、並非怕中國、實因國際關係、怕犯衆怒、現在他看得清楚、全世界經濟凋散、自顧不暇、異口同聲説裁兵無論何國不致單獨反日、又不能聯合對付、中國則無能抵禦、所以悍然在這時侵佔、此應認識者二、至於東北義勇軍的由來、并非固有的、實因日佔東北交通被他斷絶壟斷、割成爲多少片段、東北的紅鬍土匪、到處横行、所以人民家家有軍器防衛、日本不怕中國的政府、只怕東北的人民、處心積慮、要收他們的軍器、就起了不少惡感、因爲無軍器就無保障所以大起恐慌、力謀抵抗、再者漢奸每多仇人、往往誣報某村有義軍槍械、日本人就圍村燒殺老少無赦、人民感得自身危險、越發團結起來謀自衛、所以在義勇軍救國軍没有成立之前、零落抵抗、己不知有多少次數、因爲他們不是政府的正式軍隊、人們就呌他爲義勇軍、在各處反日團體成立之後、他們很感指揮不統一之苦、就各自團結起來、但看到上海來的義軍代表、自稱總司令的、己有七人之多、諸位切莫悲觀、這是好現象、因爲交通被佔、山嶺阻隔、各個片段的統一、事實上實不可</p>
<p>能、只怕人民不肯起來、祇要起來抵抗、不管他指揮官亦好、總司令亦好、總歸是好現象、兄弟受朱霽青之託、辦理東北救國軍後方事務、朱先生是很有歷史的人、辛亥從日本留學歸來、就不斷在遼甯家鄉奔走革命、倒袁護法諸役、他都活動、他是只會做事、不善説話的人、所以名終不顯、今春他在天津閑住、本匹夫有責之義决心出關救國、關外的義軍、亦函使往返、請他去主持指揮、他負着重病出關、歷盡艱苦、不避險阻、以一養尊處優的中委、吃着冷水泡的高梁、每天徒步走六七十里的山路、自是難能可貴、當他回到天津的時候、我幾乎不認識他、憔悴黧黑、瘦不成形、還病着痢疾、可是他心裏始終很快活的、他本爲找死地而去、現在非特不死、而且看着大可爲、所以很興奮地要長期奮鬥、繞到各處去請求援助、東北義軍有槍械、有熱血、所缺的就是子彈不充足、雖然、也可向日本的和奸、購買多少、不過爲了整個的計劃、還是不得不予以澈底援助的、義勇軍的消息、我們在報紙上得知其工作的大概情形、的確是大有可爲的、現在又有整個新的計劃、恕我不能宣佈、在不久的將來、也許有很驚人很可喜的消息、傅播給我們、這是堪以告慰大家的、朱先生是東北的人、是個亡國奴、我是河北的人、是個預備亡國奴、諸位也許是第三第四的候補的亡國奴、日本的侵華、並非局部問題、是整個的策略、我們非下全力抵抗不可希望大家起來努力、努力援助朱先生、努力援助東北的亡國奴、努力救未亡的整個中國、</p>

<h3 id="c172">從胡佛的眼涙説起 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>一九二八年。胡佛氏當選美國總統。入宫就職。圍而歡呼者數十萬。氏出答謝。退而感泣。嗚呼。身負全國寄托之重。苟非涕泣自奮。何由勵精圖治。此固非常之涙。非所望於中國之當局。故中國卒致不治。可勝慨哉。</p>
<p>日本世界運動選手織田·横田。因病落選。翡憤塡胸。泗涕被面。雖涉小家氣度。不愧英雄本色。此固非常之涙。非所望於中國之體育界。故中國體育卒致偃蹇不振。可勝慨哉。</p>
<p>民十七。寜漢分裂。某中委慨然曰。黨國領袖苟不共聚一堂。抱頭痛哭。决無精誠團結之日。嗚呼。言猶在耳。寒暑五易。在此五年之中。所謂黨國領袖者。除鬥氣·辭職·宣言·出國·等悲劇外。别無所見。馴致國勢阽危如今日。亦未聞有痛哭愧悔。團結禦侮之表示。甚且爾詐我虞。四分五裂。一仍不死不活之局。蓋必有非常之人。方能灑非常之涙。此固非常之事。非所望於今日黨國領袖。故黨基卒致不固。國且敗亡無日。可勝慨哉。</p>
<p>熱河驚耗傅來。跑的跑。哭的哭。某大員招待記者時痛哭而言曰。某父子苟不愛國。何致今日。其言悽絶。令人酸鼻。顧此一腔熱涙。果能灑於九一八毁家捨身誓死抗賊之役。豈不驚天動地而泣鬼神</p>

<p>— 清</p>
<p>胡立夫以［漢奸］著。今己解京矣。考［奸］字。音干。如唐韻集韵韻會。皆古寒切。與居寒切稍異。不當讀若［艱。］説文亦曰犯也。玉篇曰亂也。增韻僅云非禮也。左傅成十三年［奸絶我好］前漢溝洫志［使神人各得其所。而不相奸。］今俗語謂不相關者。曰［不相干。］即此意也。唯集韻亦讀居顔切。音［菅。］私也。僞也。也不讀平聲。莊子天運篇［尚以者七十二君。］與史記齊史家［尚以漁釣奸周。則與［干］通。皆與今之［漢奸］含意不同。然則漢奸之［奸字。其有訛乎。考［姦］與［奸］同音。説文云私也。一曰詐也淫也。書舜典［寇賊姦宄。］註［刦人曰寇。殺人曰賊。在外曰姦。在内曰宄］禮學禮［政以一其行。刑以防其姦。］管子君臣藉［止詐拘姦。厚國之道也。］［奸］與［姦。］似同而實異。故今［漢奸］一名詞。當用［姦。］不當用［奸。］明甚。考古文本寫［　］會意字也。唯朝鮮沿用中國書。乃獨以［姦］爲［奸］字。［奸］爲［姦］字。見之正字通。則爲别解。不可訓己。余於是乎作辨奸。</p>
<p>哉。縱使不幸敗亡。天下後世有哀其志面矜其遇者矣。此涙雖得其主。不得其時。可勝惜哉。</p>

<p>自由談前載有覺民君所記飛鷹小史一節。據余所知。頗有出入。願代正之。</p>
<p>飛鷹號爲我國碩果僅存之唯一驅逐艦。計現值二百餘萬元。航行速度。在海艦中素稱最高。約每小時二十三海哩强。誠如覺民君所云。遜清西太后曾遣以追捕戊戍政變巨子康有爲氏。但未獲。該艦鍋爐即以此次使用過度而毁損一部。民六程總長璧光率領南下討袁護法。駐泊珠江。遂全廢置。直至地濟深主粤。怵海防空虚。始斥資十萬加以修治。所修爲鍋爐内水管全部。及船底鋼板零星機件等等。並非鍋爐。更非鮑羅廷所購贈。歷任艦長在民十二至十七爲贛人黃振。繼爲粤人舒宗鎏。即十八年反陳策率海軍踞白鵝潭與空軍抗戰之領袖。又繼爲陳鼎。再陳傑。迄此次戰沉之兼海部副官長任耀奎氏。中間曾無易艦長爲俄人一度曾爲共黨活動之大本營事。此次沉没於瓊島海口。各報大都以爲被炸所致。其實非是。蓋雖曾受内戰勇將丁紀徐投中一彈。但傷在右舷面。毁一砲而己。殊非要害。特艦員懼死圖竄。復奉陸戰隊司令陳慶雲之甯沉不資敵則縱敗猶榮之主張所自放沉耳。惜哉。夫以我國現有海軍之微弱。而國力不遑建設。乃竟有人視此區區毫不珍重。贸然奮其武勇。毁國器於鬩牆之争。眞可慨也。</p>

<h3 id="c177">二十一條秘史（三） <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 思蘋</p>
<p>二月二十五日我往北京。二月二十七日到逹。二月二十八日我訪芮恩士公使。没有遇着。三月一日我同芮恩士有一重要談話。他對我説。他己把我們的呈文轉致美國政府了。他呌我一面函告美國聯合新聞的幹事史東去訪日本駐美公使珍田。一面請王正廷孔祥熙勸勉中國人民力持鎭静。我也呌芮恩士去見英公使喬爾敦。力言英國袒護日本暴行的不當。</p>
<p>我從别的方面得悉日置益懷了二十一條要求直接往見袁世凱。他袖出條文向袁逐條宣讀。袁總統就問他是否己把這要求向外交部提出。日置益答稱没有到外交部就直接來覲見總统的。袁世凱對他説。中國是一個立憲國家。這要求必須向外交部提出。但是日置益充耳不聞。硬把要求條文遺在桌上而去。袁世凱遂即召見喬爾敦和芮恩士研究。</p>
<p>二十一條要求提出之前。日置益預先邀到美國聯合新聞社記者慕爾和倫敦泰晤時報記者唐納。日置益對他們説道。日本政府此時舉行盛會。請他們前往。一切旅費等自然概歸日本政府供給。他們大可乘此良機赴日觀光。對於日本可以獲得更深切的瞭解。他們經此一番甘言誘惑。就接受了邀請往東京去了。北京方面的職務概由助手代庖。</p>
<p>這兩個重要的新聞記者一出了北京。日置益連忙向袁世凱提出要求。翌晨。英使館方面打電話呌倫敦泰晤時報和美國聯合新聞的駐京記者慕爾和唐納前去。無奈他們早被日置益事前用調虎離山之計騙往東京去了。慕爾和唐納的助手就到英使館。英使館方面就把二十一條要求各給一份。囑即拍電到倫敦泰晤時報和美國聯合新聞發表。美國聯合新聞的幹事史爾接了二十一條要求的電報。覺得十分奇特。不敢發表。史東一面持了電稿去見駐搭華盛頓的日使珍田。請求證實。珍田竭力否認。後來日本政府也正式否認。史東遂拍電慕爾。嚴辭責詰。爲何不辨眞僞就把足以惹起戰事的二十一條發電。並令追究該項新聞的來源。倫敦泰晤時報也發同樣的電報責間唐納。</p>

<h3 id="c198">出洋留學行（續） <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>昨天所説，意猶未盡，今日再來談，</p>
<p>留學生化了許多金錢，費了多少時間，到外國去留學，其宗旨若僅僅博得博士碩士頭銜，歸來爲榮宗耀祖之具者，不必説，即眞正去研究求學問，也應該認清路逕，若不從牢靠而有用的路走，專從虚僞而無用的路走，走來走去，總是差路。</p>
<p>故留學生出洋，須要認定目標，觀案我國貧弱的病根，選擇我國目前所須要，不能馬馬虎虎，前去求學，我所最不願意聽到的，就是政治經濟等頭銜，現在我國幾成爲割據之局，政治走不上軌道，財政無法爬梳，高談什麽政治，什麽政策，都是牛頭不對馬面，外國的老文章，完全抄不上去，</p>
<p>不能説留學生也有做了官，有了地位，就算留學生的成績，留學生的效能，這種學生，也算不得有利於國家，有益於社會，不過一個人出出風頭罷了，本來［戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同，］有的靠了留學生牌頭，一躍而爲舞台上要角，有的想盡方法，還找不出一條出路，故莊子説，</p>
<p>宋人有善爲不龜手之藥者，世世以　　洴澼統爲事，客聞之，請買其方百　　金，客得之，以説吴王，吴王使之　　將，冬與越人戰，大敗越人，裂地　　而封之，能不龜手一也，或以封，　　或不免爲洴澼絖，則所用異也，</p>
<p>確眞，要陞官發財，原要有陞官發財的手段，陞官發財的路角，若你有了牌頭，没有手段，没有路角，原是不中用的，我聽見友人説，有某某兩留學生，有某機關服務，月支薪水二十四元，我不是替留學生算賬，説一句小氣的話，假定一個學生讀到留學畢業，學費至少在萬金以上，時間又費十四五年之多，倘然拿這種學費，自小累積起來，到十四五年之久，至少有二萬元，若把二萬元存諸銀行，每月總可得百六七十元的利息，</p>
<p>現在留學生在某機關辦事，僅支三十四元的薪水，這種蝕本生意如何算法呢，或説，一個人在世界上，本來不是孳孳爲利的，須要在社會上做番事業，替國家出些汗血，方不負人生一世，不過僅僅在一個公司中做些事，决不會做出名堂來，我説這樣的話，並不是鄙夷留學生，因爲留學生事前没有認定目標，便去留學，至得到這樣的結果，</p>

<p>記者平日主張，以爲學校不僅是呌學生看幾篇書，做幾篇文，就算了事，應該注重實際工作，往昔學校，多在嘴的方面用工夫，而忘却手的用處，譬如演講競賽會等，爲課外工作的必需品，而上物理化學課的時候，反拿了小説去聽講，演講原也不可廢棄，但是［坐而言，不如起而行］這是我們青年所應該認識的，在現在的時期，我們中國，不是貼幾張標語，講幾句演説，可以挽救危亡的，所以我希望學校當局，把以前的工藝課中的剪紙摺紙等近於消費工作，無補實用的自然教材，變爲生動而有無限與味的工藝製造，既然可以開闢學校的新財源，又可養成社會生産的眞人才，豈不是一舉二得，事半功倍呢？作者不敏，敢將平日研究所得，舉其所知，告之當世，尚希明逹有以教正。</p>

<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>(甲)眞筆板上所用的原紙　　原料、直辣的尼西錢，明礬二錢，清水八兩，倔里設林或砂糖少許，落靱的紙。</p>
<p>製法拿直辣的尼浸在二兩青水中，等他完全溶解，滤過後，加入倔里設林或砂糖少許，把紙浸在這溶液裏面，</p>
<p>待他滲透了，取出陰乾之，一面將明礬溶解在六兩青水中，取下陰乾的紙，把他浸在明礬水裏，大約過了五分鐘，把他取出，乾燥後，便可應用。</p>
<p>（乙）鋼筆板上所用的原紙</p>
<p>原料松香油一兩，白蠟一兩，巴拉芬二兩，白堊一兩半，薄靱的紙。　　製法用搪瓷鍋一只，放在炭火上置巴拉芬和白蠟於鍋中，待他溶解，再加入白堊和松香油，竭力拌攪，約二十分鐘後，去火待冷，把他塗在白紙上，要塗得很均匀，這樣，乾燥後便成爲上等原紙了。</p>
<p>二·墨粉製法，俗語説·［寫字容易靡墨難］所以我們往往用墨水，但是他携帶不便，一般小學生或旅行家，帶了自來水筆，覺得不夠用，帶了墨水，很不方便，於是我們不能不創製一種墨粉，他的原料是：樹膠七錢半，没食子四兩，皂礬一兩三錢，水糖一錢，把上述的原料，混合研細，用絹篩篩過，裝成小紙包，或貯在和藏人丹一樣的鐵盒内，用時祇以沸水把粉溶化，便可用他寫字了。</p>

<p>— 吴敵</p>
<p>目前在申報本埠增刋上看到署名［振］的一則［男女平等的問題］，不免有些不服氣，特來説上幾句，我想賢明的編輯先生或者允許我發表吧！</p>
<p>的確，男女間是尚没平等。要解决這個問題，確非容易。在我國社會人衆的腦筋裏，常存着輕侮女性，苛責女性的心理，所以男子犯了奸淫的罪惡，人家便加原諒，説：這是青年人免不了的一種通病，過了時間，自會改過的。假使女子犯了這種他們所謂男子的通病，人家心目中便一輩子不認他是人。雖名爲維新派者，也免不了有這種偏頗的觀念，這豈是尊重女子人格的原由嗎？　　現在那篇［男女平等的問題］的作者，他批評女子的話，也具有輕侮女性，苛責女性的劣根性，偏頗之見，自然流露出來了，第一。先得請問他女子要怎樣才能成爲他所認爲完善的人呢？據他所舉的三種講：</p>
<p>第一種也不得謂爲依賴男子作男子的奴隸。不過思想上的不覺悟，也正見她們受惡劣環境的壓迫，受不到高尚教育的可隣！若男子以此而挾制女子，那就見得太苛責了。因爲其間相差的，不過一個是服務社會，和一個是服務家庭罷了，這不是同樣的盡責嗎？若説家庭中經濟的擔負，是獨由男子一人肩任的，這便是不平，那我可要問家庭中的事務，却是不是獨由女子來主持操勞的？權利義務，當然相對，難道男子都枵腹從公，不拿社會上一個錢的嗎？若説依頼男子，必是男子的奴隸，那麽男子也寄人籬下，依賴着人家生活，是不是奴隸呢？若説男子是對於社會上盡了一分義務，才得一分報酬，這是於心無愧的：那麽同樣的理由，女子難道在家裏不盡義務的嗎？况且在家裏一切的費用，不能説是丈夫供給妻子一人享用的，妻子所享用的，是她應得的報酬。對於子女果然有共同負責的義務，但是妻子盡了保育的責任，丈夫不該盡瞻養的責任？</p>
<p>第二三種説：女子是男子的玩物，我看男子要求做女子的玩物而不得的，眞獨自皆是：［甘隸妝台伺眼波］便是你們斯文男子的得意之作呢？穿一二件新式衣服，便説是玩物：那麽男子朝一套西裝，暮一套西裝，塗雪花膏，灑香水，這是何等居心！關於交際塲所，男子做着種種醜態，以冀獻媚於女子的，又是何種的人物？做何人的玩物？女界的敗類固多，但是男子恐有過之而無不及吧！我們固感謝善意的諷勸，使今日的女界，在黑暗中放一線曙光：但是這種謾駡的態度，偏頗的成見，却不是學者所應出此吧！若説服務於社會，致力於家政，以一人而肩兩種事情，實足稱多，却還以不曾負擔家庭生活費爲苛責，這眞十足表見出作者自私自利的一個東西！倘使男子們都能分擔了家務的一半責任，那末女子是極該也分擔家庭中經濟的一半責任的。否則那就是偏，就是不平！倘使説家政不是男子所擅長的，因此該由女子們獨任：那未女子們擔任了家政，而男子們供給家用，就不得説女子依賴男子！</p>
<p>末了，我要請求我們女同胞們，對於這種無理的侮謾辱駡，可不要吞聲忍氣，使得人們以爲女子可欺而得步進步的放肆起來了啊！</p>

<p>［栖：你不要憂時傷國了，你且看這些［及時行樂］的人吧！我扯住了栖，就站停在遊藝塲門口。</p>
<p>［哼！］栖僅從鼻孔中發了一聲響，並没有説别的話，顯見他非常的不樂意。接着我們就打量這遊藝塲的進出口的熱閙情形，只看見三三二二的擠着進去，四個的賣票洞穴，彷佛永遠不空着的，同時門口依然不斷地由黃包車夫彎着腰拖來的，或由十一號汽車渡來的（戲稱二條腿走來的，呌做十一號汽車，大概是時髦的流行語。）其間有着穿長旗衫的姑娘與婦人，穿着藍布短衫的工人階級，也有穿着綢長衫和漂亮西裝的少年們，個個都顯得興高烈彩，急忙忙的向了黑壓壓的進口處溜着。後來我們發現了一個穿黃制服的警士擠了進去，接着又有一位穿灰色軍服的現役軍人也踱到了裏面。</p>
<p>［唏！］栖到這時候抽了一口大氣，扯了我接着説［走罷！中國的病態眞己入膏盲了！本來熱河離此地太遠了，除非再演一回［一二八］的事件，許會使他們驚惶呢！］</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Fundamental Problem of Resistance <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Those discussing the Japanese bandits' invasion of Rehe sometimes say that the Japanese attack on Rehe must wait until after the "green gauze tents" (tall crops that provide cover) are gone. They believe that this current offensive is still exploratory in nature. Others say that Saito is trying to use the attack on Rehe to divert the attention of the Japanese government and public, avoiding the storm of the current Diet session, so he deliberately launched it at the time of the Diet's convocation. Still others say that the Japanese attack on Rehe is a predetermined step in their continental policy, and this action will become more serious and expand. Some say that the Northeast Volunteer Army is powerful and Japan cannot pacify it, so they must attack Rehe to cut off contact with the Volunteer Army. Still others say that Japan and Russia are preparing for war, and what Russia urgently wants to protect today is Siberia and Outer Mongolia's power, so Japan's attack on Rehe is intended to preemptively strike, using swift means to give Outer Mongolia a major threat. I, however, say that whether the Japanese launch is early or late, their intention and focus, regardless of what matter it pertains to or what direction it aims, we must only recognize that the Japanese attack on Rehe is an unfinished step in their annexation of Manchuria. Japan, in order to consolidate the three eastern provinces it has already pocketed, must take Rehe. Conversely, if we want to protect Rehe, we must first retake the three eastern provinces. This is because resisting the Rehe bandits and recovering the lost territory of the Northeast are not two separate matters. If the lost territory of the Northeast cannot be recovered, then the harm caused by the Japanese bandits will not be limited to Rehe. Even if we can firmly defend Rehe, the Japanese bandits, with their myriad schemes, can launch an offensive at any time. Today they invade Rehe, tomorrow they can invade Beiping and Tianjin. Our army defends day and night, but how can there be no moment of懈怠? Therefore, merely resisting the Rehe bandits is only a temporary measure, equal to patching the sheepfold after the sheep is lost. If we do not plan to pursue the lost sheep of the Northeast and only repair the Rehe fold, then not only will the lost sheep never return, but the fold will also never be secure. Last time, when the Japanese invaded Shanghai, our countrymen recognized that the entire Northeast issue was a unified problem and unanimously advocated that the Northeast must be resolved first. Now Rehe is adjacent to the three eastern provinces, so in fact, isn't it even more of a unified problem? Why is attention not paid to this instead? Therefore, for the sake of fundamentally saving the country, we, the people of our country, have no other choice but to go all out and actively prepare to recover the three eastern provinces.</p>
<p>However, merely saying that we should recover the lost territory of the three eastern provinces is still not a fundamental solution. To speak of the fundamental, we must first ask how our country will strive to recover the lost territory. Fundamentally resisting Japan does not only rely on military equipment, but also on the assistance of all aspects of the nation. To concentrate the strength of all aspects to assist the front lines, each aspect must first have self-sufficiency and the ability to safely take care of itself, and only then will there be surplus strength to help others. Recently, a Japanese scholar said: [Our people should not only be happy with the military victory in Manchuria. Try to look back at the domestic economic recession, the collapse of the rural economy, and the inconsistency of opinions between parties, government officials, civilians, and military personnel. The frequent occurrence of dangerous incidents is truly what is called "national disaster." If the day of national disaster is not overcome, then obtaining Manchuria is like obtaining an empty treasure. Our people must work together to save the current national disaster.] Japan is a country that invades others, a country that is arrogant and thinks it is invincible. However, enlightened people in Japan are not happy about acquiring Manchuria, but are worried about the country's disasters. However, all the various so-called national disasters that they have, our country possesses, and even more so. Therefore, Japan's national disaster is lighter than ours, but their people are already paying close attention to this and are worried about acquiring the empty treasure of Manchuria. Shouldn't our people pay ten times more attention to our national disasters? Moreover, the so-called national disaster of our country is caused by foreign aggression, but it cannot but be attributed to the continuous internal troubles. Therefore, today, when we talk about resisting Japan as a fundamental solution, our country, from top to bottom, must have a great awakening and a great determination to rise up together to eliminate the obstacles to resisting foreign aggression and eradicate the root of the disease of continuous foreign aggression. Politics, society, and everything must be put on the right track, and the people must have the power to survive and the opportunity to unite, and then they can rise up to resist foreign aggression and eliminate it for the country. Besides this, there is no other way.</p>
<p>Alas, for nearly a year, the voices of our countrymen who speak of resistance have been hoarse and exhausted. Time flows like a river, and the landscape changes repeatedly. The temporary excitement of emotions is difficult to sustain and difficult to be effective. If we continue to procrastinate like this, I am afraid that the sound of resistance will be equal to a commonplace, and the longer the sound lasts, the more insignificant it becomes, gradually becoming something that is heard but not listened to. However, the oppression of foreign aggression is getting closer and more urgent. Will our countrymen completely leave the problem of the survival of the nation to the evolution of nature? If so, then even if we want to recover the empty treasure, it will not be possible, which is truly heartbreaking.</p>

<p>A regular meeting of the Investigative Commission was held at the German Hospital in Beiping today. The report is being hastened and is scheduled to be delivered to the Council of the League of Nations in Geneva around September 20. The report has many items, and if it is difficult to complete by the end of the month, the departure of the commissioners from Beiping will be delayed. The memorandum submitted by the Chinese delegation to the commission has been completed and was delivered today. Another full memorandum on the Northeast Incident is being prepared and is scheduled to be carried to Geneva by Qian Tai and Yan Deqing with the Investigative Commission on September 5, and handed over to Yan Huiqing to be sent to the League of Nations Executive Yuan. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Because Lord Lytton still resides in the German Hospital, the League of Nations Investigative Commission in Beiping holds meetings at the hospital every day. The work of compiling the report is progressing steadily and is expected to be submitted during the initial stage of the League of Nations General Assembly. Once compiled, it will be sent to Geneva by the fastest route, where printing in English and French is convenient. The Chinese and Japanese translations will be completed in the two countries separately. The Investigative Commission is currently working on the historical and narrative sections of the report. Once the two types of materials are gathered, the scope covered will be very broad, and the rest will be categorized separately. The drafting of the conclusion will be left to the last minute. It is said that major events will be discussed extensively until the report is sealed and issued. Regarding this point, what can be noted is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already reported the Rehe Incident to the League of Nations. It has not yet been decided when the Investigative Commission will depart and which route it will take back to Europe. It is still questionable whether it will take the route through Siberia, because this route is usually the fastest, but northern Manchuria is currently suffering from severe flooding, and also due to the tiger plague in northern Manchuria, quarantine may be required in Manchuria, which must be taken into consideration. It is said that the investigators may return by different routes. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>After driving the Red Army back to Jiangxi Province, Yu Hanmou, Commander of the First Army of Guangdong Province, recently returned to the province from the front lines to report on the progress of the five-month war. He said that the number of Red Army soldiers is greater than that of the Guangdong Army, but the Guangdong Army uses field warfare to encircle and defeat them. No less than 60,000 Red Army soldiers came from Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, attacking Nanxiong and other places in an attempt to enter northern Guangdong. The situation at this time was very urgent. Fortunately, reinforcements arrived quickly, allowing the situation to turn from danger to safety. The Guangdong Army fought the Red Army seventy times in five months, with one battle lasting five days without rest. Commander Yu also mentioned the corruption of the officialdom in Jiangxi Province, saying that the rampant Communist activities in Jiangxi Province were actually caused by the corruption of the officialdom. Commander Yu also spoke of the cruel atrocities of the Communists in executing prisoners, saying that they first subjected them to branding with hot irons and then killed them. Jiangxi Province was originally a peaceful area, but since the Communists occupied it, the people have been living in misery. Not only have the cities become ruins, but the people are also waiting for destruction, which cannot be fully described in words. The Red Army is divided into five groups: one is the Red Defense Army, composed of bandits and terrorists; the second is the Field Army; the third is the Independent Regiment and Independent Division; the fourth is the Red Army; and the fifth is the Communist Youth League, composed of young men and women, some of whom are under fourteen years old. Although the Red Army was defeated in Guangdong, it still occupies Jiangxi Province and will eventually be a scourge to the border. According to Commander Yu, if one wants to eliminate the Red disaster, it is necessary to establish effective local governments everywhere. Without them, the root of the Red disaster will be difficult to eradicate. (23rd Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Uchida Instructs Mutō to Conduct Treaty Negotiations</p>
<p>Saitō to Deliver Important Speech on China in Beiping and Shanghai</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 19th: The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun and Kokumin Shimbun today each devoted several columns to the news that Japan will formally grant legal recognition to the [Manchukuo Puppet State] on September 18th, the anniversary of the [South Manchuria Railway bombing] incident. The Kokumin Shimbun's report is even more detailed than the Nichinichi Shimbun's. The newspaper claimed that the Japanese government will not only grant formal recognition to the [Manchukuo Puppet State], but will also conclude a basic treaty with the [Manchukuo Puppet State], and that the draft treaty will be sent to the League of Nations Secretariat for registration. It is reported that the Japanese side has completed the drafting of the treaty, and Foreign Minister Uchida has instructed General Mutō on the main points of the treaty one by one. The contents of the treaty are roughly as follows: (1) Since the interests of Japan and the [Manchukuo Puppet State] are consistent, the defense of the [Manchukuo Puppet State] should be handled entirely by Japan; (2) The operation of all railways in the [Manchukuo Puppet State] should be entirely entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway; (3) The [Manchukuo Puppet State] should inherit all treaties previously signed by China, but treaties that hinder the independence of the [Manchukuo Puppet State] should be excluded; (4) All Japanese rights in Manchuria should be included in the treaty as much as possible; (5) All Japanese who are currently officials of the [Manchukuo Puppet State] should be given proper guarantees; (6) Japanese should have the freedom to travel, reside, and trade in Manchuria; (7) In principle, extraterritoriality should be abolished immediately, but a separate treaty should be concluded to stipulate the actual implementation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 24th: According to reliable reports, Japan will recognize the [Manchukuo Puppet State] on September 7th, but official circles say that recognition may not occur before mid-September, because Mutō must first go to Changchun for negotiations, and then the Privy Council must consider the results of his negotiations.</p>

Uchida's speech is especially eagerly anticipated, and the original text will be published in Shanghai, Beiping, and major embassies overseas.

<p>Decides Not to Extend the Session</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 24th: The government's initial strategy for the special session of the Diet was to obtain the understanding of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives as the top priority. However, it was discovered that a part of the Seiyukai and the National League had decided to propose an extension of the session, and behind them was a movement to revise the budget bill because the government's relief budget for the current situation was not thorough. Prime Minister Saitō consulted with Chief Secretary Shibata yesterday afternoon and decided on the following policy: (1) If a motion to extend the session is proposed at the beginning of the Diet session, the government will absolutely oppose it. Although the Seiyukai executives and the Minseitō have the same view on this, the government's core members will not join the National League, so the resolution to extend the session will not be passed, and there is no need to worry about this. (2) If there is criticism that the relief budget for the current situation is not thorough, the government can declare that the budget bill submitted this time is an emergency measure to adapt to the emergency situation, and the fundamental strategy must be submitted to the ordinary session of the Diet to deal with it. Therefore, it was decided not to carry out any more understanding movements and to adopt a wait-and-see approach, adapting to circumstances as they arise.</p>

<p>Right Wing Fears Russian Disaster</p>
<p>Great Tendency to Favor Japan</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: The attitude of the British delegation attending the next League of Nations conference towards the issues of the open door policy in Manchuria, the unification of Chinese customs management rights, and the recognition of the [Manchukuo] government will undoubtedly be swayed by the British fear of their Far East trade. The left-wing group in the House of Commons is now making every effort to criticize the recent actions of the Japanese in Manchuria, while the elite of the right wing exclusively support Japan. The power of these people in discussing national affairs should not be underestimated, because Conservative members of the House of Commons account for the majority. The right wing is well aware of the difficulties Japan has encountered in negotiations with China in recent years, and regards Japan as the only barrier in the Far East to resist Soviet Russia's policy of world aggression. Soviet Russia's eyes are now focused on the Indian border and the East Russian border. Any action that seems to be able to resist the [Russian disaster] will be supported by the opinions of the British army and navy. At present, rumors are rife, and most of them come from the American side, saying that Li _ harshly criticizes, so people in general are waiting anxiously for the outcome of the League of Nations conference in October. However, this rumor has not been verified by responsible parties in London and is probably from anti-Japanese parties.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Japan and the United States Compete for Hegemony in the Pacific <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>American Fleet Stays in the Pacific</p>
<p>Gives Japan a Great Threat</p>
<p>The Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun said that the US Atlantic Fleet, after participating in the large-scale exercise, has repeatedly been ordered to stay on the Pacific coast, and the postponement has been extended to March of next year. The reason is that it is affected by the austerity plan, because another large-scale exercise is to be held again in February of next year. No matter what the stated reasons are, it is not difficult to predict the true intentions of the United States after the US Atlantic Fleet has been postponed three times. The United States' ambition to control the Pacific Ocean began with Secretary of State Seward's declaration during President Lincoln's time that "the future of the United States lies in the Pacific." During Roosevelt's time, he shouted loudly again, "Those who can control the Pacific Ocean can grasp the hegemony of the world." Since then, the United States' ambitions have gradually become concrete. On the one hand, it advocated the open door policy, and on the other hand, President Filmore ordered Commodore Perry to expedition to Japan. In 1898, it declared war on Spain and illegally seized the Philippines. The power of the United States expanded to the Pacific Ocean. After the Russo-Japanese War, the United States secretly harbored the intention of seizing the South Manchuria Railway. By the time of the Harriman Agreement, it was destroyed by our (Japanese) Minister Komura. The United States gradually changed its attitude towards Japan and put pressure on Japan, such as attempting to establish the Manchuria Bank, planning to divide the Fakumen Railway and the Jinai Railway, launching four-nation loans, prohibiting Japanese immigrants, and convening the Washington Conference. All of them were intended to prevent Japan's progress. Although Japan has repeatedly endured, the United States has repeatedly put pressure on it, and its ambition to control the Pacific Ocean has not been reduced. Since the September 18th Incident in Manchuria last year, the words and deeds of the United States have made all Japanese people never forget. Recently, Secretary of State Stimson openly referred to Japan as an aggressor, and President Hoover ridiculed Japan in secret, which made the Japanese people feel even more unpleasant. Now, the Atlantic Fleet has been postponed three times to stay in the Pacific. After the report of the League of Nations investigation team is submitted, the League Assembly will inevitably have major disputes. At that time, it will put pressure on Japan. However, we are not belligerent, and the United States is so blatant in advancing its policy of Pacific hegemony that Japan has no choice but to make a decision to awaken and defend itself. Originally, the Japanese sea system is a lake, and the people cannot survive. Therefore, Japan cannot realize world peace without obtaining the paradise of Manchuria. The United States is threatening this paradise. If the United States does not give up its ambition to dominate the Pacific, then Japan and the whole world may not have peace. In short, the new situation in East Asia can determine the fate of the day in this League Assembly. We Japanese should be vigilant against the United States without slackening.</p>

<p>Japan Releases the Air of Withdrawing from the League of Nations Again</p>
<p>Intending to Scare Britain and France into Supporting It</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 24th: According to information from the Japanese delegation in Geneva yesterday to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the League of Nations General Assembly to deal with the Manchuria issue this autumn has decided on the following agenda: (1) The Lytton Investigation Report can be submitted to the League of Nations Secretariat by September 15th. By the end of September, the report will be translated, sorted out, and distributed to China, Japan, and the member states of the Council; (2) The member states of the Council will study the report for about two weeks; (3) A public Council meeting will be held in Geneva from October 12th to review the report; (4) After the public Council meeting continues for about a week, the report will be transferred to the League of Nations General Assembly. The nineteen-nation committee will reconvene on October 20th, and the General Assembly will reconvene to begin its review. The General Assembly will be held in early November.</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 24th: Japanese officials are again creating an atmosphere of withdrawal from the League of Nations, saying that Japan's recognition of Manchukuo's independence is Japan's freedom and should not be interfered with by the League of Nations. Japan has sent Nagaoka, Sato, and Matsuoka as representatives to fight against the League of Nations. If the League of Nations cannot understand Japan's will, the Japanese government is determined to withdraw from the League of Nations, with the intention of scaring Britain and France into backing Japan.</p>

<p>Hitler Shelters Criminal Party Members</p>
<p>Declares Willingness to Negotiate with the Government</p>
<p>Papen States He Will Not Succumb to Any Pressure</p>
<p>New Parliament Likely to Be Dissolved</p>
<p>Reuter's Berlin, 23rd - Within a week of Prime Minister Papen's impending negotiations with the new parliament, Nazi Party leader Hitler's vociferous protests against the death sentences of five Nazi Party members have created a major political storm. Hitler has issued a strongly worded declaration, stating, "Papen, your thirst for blood, in my view, does not exist. I am not worthy to be an executioner of those who fight for freedom out of patriotism. If you believe I can fulfill this role, you are greatly mistaken. Heaven may inflict cruel punishment upon us, but our movement will be able to cope with this guillotine-style government." The central government recently issued an emergency decree prohibiting political violence and establishing special courts to punish those who violate this decree. Just one and a half hours after this decree was issued, five Nazi Party members in the Buschen district of Silesia broke into the home of a Communist Party member, severely beat him unconscious, and then shot him dead. Yesterday, the court found the crime to be true and sentenced them to death. According to the law, this case cannot be appealed, but the defendants may, based on the grounds that they were unaware of the ban when it was initially issued, petition the Ministry of Justice for a retrial. If approved, the case can be tried in an ordinary court. The government believes that Hitler's condemnation of the government and protection of the defendants are extremely detrimental to the defendants and the Nazi Party. Papen, therefore, finds it difficult to express leniency toward the defendants, as doing so would be seen as succumbing to pressure from the Nazi Party. The Ministry of Justice is awaiting a report from those who originally tried the case and may not make any decision before the end of this week. Tonight, the government has issued a declaration expressing considerable indignation at Hitler's actions and the tone of the Nazi Party newspapers. The declaration states that any actions that seek to undermine the principles of constitutional government by inciting political fanaticism will be stopped immediately according to the law, regardless of who or what party they belong to. The Prussian government will not be coerced by political pressure in the case of the five Nazi Party members who committed murder.</p>
<p>Reuter's Berlin, 24th - After Nazi Party leader Hitler issued a declaration, the government also issued a declaration in response. All parties opposed to the Nazi Party believe that Hitler's final move has now failed. Even if the Nazi Party and the Central Party jointly overthrow the Papen government, President Hindenburg may not agree to Hitler as prime minister. It is generally expected that the Prussian government may spare the death penalty for the Buschen criminals, except for the mastermind Lachmann. The Nazi Party held demonstrations in Buschen and Breslau last night, but they were easily dispersed by the police. The special court established under the emergency decree held its first hearing in Berlin today, trying cases of Communist Party members bombing Nazi Party members.</p>
<p>Havas, Douzburg, 23rd - The residence of a Nazi Party member here (formerly affiliated with the Communist Party) was attacked. The Nazi Party member's wife was shot ten times by rioters and severely injured. The authorities have arrested three Communist Party members suspected of participating in the murder.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 24th - There is no doubt that the new parliament elected in July will be dissolved before it can vote on the Papen cabinet. The German cabinet is determined not to become a minority in parliament. When Prime Minister Papen attends parliament, he will carry an order signed by President Hindenburg to dissolve parliament. This order will be taken from the famous red Morocco leather briefcase carried by Papen and read out at the appropriate time. However, after the parliament is dissolved, will there be a re-election? The 44 million men and women voters in Germany have already voted three times this year. Is it necessary to hold a fourth election? This is something that deserves attention.</p>

<p>Reuter's, Madrid, 24th - The trial of Spanish General Sanjurjo for rebellion opened today. Hundreds of people gathered outside the courthouse for hours, wanting to enter and listen to the trial, including many women. The prosecutor requested the death penalty. General Sanjurjo, dressed in black and looking haggard, was escorted into the hospital by police and friends, but his friends were not allowed into the courtroom and could only wait in the side room during the preliminary hearing. Young, zealous Socialist Party members in Madrid plastered red leaflets on the walls, denouncing the military's victory over civilian justice. Telegrams arrived from all over, demanding that General Sanjurjo be sentenced to death. However, it is heard that the Spanish President has expressed agreement with the Socialist Party's opposition to the death penalty in principle. It is generally believed that the verdict of the rebellion case may not be announced today.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e90">Social Conditions in Southern Guizhou <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Population Reaches Over Ten Million</p>
<p>Sichuanese Immigrants Are the Most Numerous</p>
<p>Rural Economy Gradually Collapsing</p>
<p>No Modern Factories in Industry</p>
<p>No New Progress in Education</p>
<p>The Nation Should Pay Close Attention</p>
<p>Do Not Ignore It Because of Its Remoteness</p>
<p>Guizhou is a province in the country that was developed relatively late. People often overlook it because it is located in the remote southwest, or even have superstitious fears, mistakenly viewing Guizhou as a place of miasma and danger, without understanding the true situation. If this view is not eliminated, the southwest will never have any hope of development. Those with capital will hesitate to move forward, unwilling to make productive attempts. This is no small matter for the national economy and people's livelihood. I recently traveled to Southern Guizhou and will briefly describe the situation, hoping to provide a reference.</p>
<p>Distribution of Han and Miao Ethnic Groups: Guizhou was once a Miao territory. Although it was said to have been established as a province during the Ming Dynasty, it was still within the sphere of influence of the Miao people. It can only be said to be the era of pioneering. It was not until the Qing Dynasty, after the Rebellion of the Three Feudatories, that the Han people became dominant. Most of the immigrants were from Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces. From the late Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China, the distribution of Han people became increasingly widespread. The northern counties of Guizhou are now entirely Han settlements, and the western counties are 70-80% Han. Only the southeastern counties, such as Danjiang, Taigong, Bazhai, and others, are still the base of the Miao people, but they are also subject to the political power of the government. The methods used by the Han people to control the Miao people in the past were purely high-pressure policies, without educational facilities or other methods of assimilation or leadership. Cunning Han people often took advantage of the Miao people's ignorance and weakness to infringe upon and exploit them. When the Miao people could not bear it, they would rebel fiercely. The government could only send troops and generals to carry out large-scale suppression and slaughter. Now, there is no room for the Miao people to exist in the cities of Guizhou. In addition to the immigrants from the past, the largest number of new immigrants are from Sichuan Province. Due to the dense population of Sichuan, and the natural geographical trend, people gradually moved south. There are more than 10,000 people per year, and most of them are farmers. Therefore, wherever the Sichuanese go, the fields are renewed. Almost every county in the province has footprints of Sichuanese people. Therefore, the population of Guizhou has actually exceeded ten million, breaking the previous record of seven million, and has become the tail end of Sichuan's population migration.</p>
<p>Products and Minerals: In addition to famous products such as mercury, cinnabar, copper ladders, and other items, the output of coal and iron is also abundant. Timber, such as fir, catalpa, pine, and cypress, are visible everywhere, which is due to the fact that Guizhou is mostly mountainous. There are hundreds of miles of forests in the eastern Guizhou area. The value of timber transported by the Yuan River each year is no less than one million yuan. Grain can only be self-sufficient. In the event of a famine, it still depends on the supply from neighboring provinces. Except for a few handicrafts, there are almost no modern factories in industry. Among the handicrafts, the most famous and unique to the province are Zunyi's oil silk, Dading's leather goods, and Angjiang's white paper. The quality of these goods is excellent and they are praised by everyone. Unfortunately, the capital is small and it is not possible to produce large quantities. White fungus and chicken fir mushrooms are also valuable specialties of Guizhou. Language, Customs, Lifestyles, and Education: Most Guizhou people are immigrants from other provinces, so there is no native language. They purely use Mandarin, and there is no barrier to communication. Over time, it has become the universal language of Guizhou. In order to survive, some Miao people have also abandoned the Miao language and learned Chinese. The customs are still considered simple and frugal. Women's short hairstyles are similar to those in Shanghai, but their clothes are not as bright and colorful. Women under the age of 40 no longer bind their feet. The general livelihood is still stagnant in the old society of self-sufficiency. Most people are engaged in agriculture. In recent years, the rural economy has collapsed and prices have risen. The number of self-cultivating farmers is decreasing. In addition to grains and wheat, Guizhou's agriculture has no other comparable side occupations. There was a promotion of silkworm cultivation in the past, but it was unsuccessful. Now, opium is rampant throughout the province, agricultural production has decreased, and livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult. Future concerns cannot be taken lightly. As for education, there are a total of nine middle schools for boys and girls in the provincial capital, and co-education has been implemented. In the past, there were also schools such as the School of Law and Politics and the School of Agriculture, but they have been closed due to the newly promulgated education system and environmental factors. There are no fewer than a dozen middle schools in other counties, both provincial and county. In Guizhou, which is culturally backward, this is still somewhat comforting.</p>
<p>From the above observations, Guizhou has abundant mineral resources. In terms of population, compared to Yunnan and Guangxi, the number of people per square mile exceeds those two provinces. The area is larger than Zhejiang. It is a pity that it is ignored by the nation because it is located in the remote west, leaving its benefits abandoned on the ground. (Chi Fo)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Changsha Citizen's Daily Newspaper Sealed <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Case of the Arrested Reporter from Cuixiang News Agency Is About to End</p>
<p>Jiang Shoushi, the Chief Editor of the Citizen's Daily, Is Arrested Again</p>
<p>The Trend of Assistance in the Press Circles Is Expanding</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: Hu Da, the garrison commander of Changsha, the provincial capital, ordered the arrest of Li Shao, a reporter from the Cuixiang News Agency, for publishing news in the Thunderbolt Newspaper that American sailors had public sex in the Oriental Hotel outside the Daximen gate and bought a young boy and a prostitute for indecent acts. Hu Da believed that this was unfounded and ordered the Thunderbolt Newspaper to hand over reporter Li Shao for detention. Unexpectedly, four days later, Officer Gong Ying of the Western District Police Station confirmed that the incident was true and handed over the prostitute, the young boy, and others to the garrison headquarters for questioning. After confirming the facts, Li Shao was released on bail, and the manager of the Oriental Hotel, Jia Shi'an, the tea room waiter Hu Yuntang, and the prostitute Qiao Yun were sent to the court for questioning. This aroused serious attention from the Changsha press circles. Each newspaper considered that the garrison headquarters' unauthorized arrest of the reporter and the Thunderbolt Newspaper's unauthorized handover of the reporter were inappropriate. At the initial meeting, everyone advocated requesting the authorities to remove and punish Hu Da for dereliction of duty and abuse of power. Each news agency would unanimously suspend sending articles to the Thunderbolt Newspaper. Later, Hu Da explained to the colleagues in the press circles, and the Thunderbolt Newspaper also apologized in writing to all the reporters. Therefore, it was decided to exempt the Thunderbolt Newspaper from further discussion to preserve the feelings of the industry. As for the garrison headquarters, it was only requested that Hu Da punish the personnel in charge of this case for impropriety, and at the same time, a request was submitted to the party and government authorities to protect journalists according to the publication law. This dispute could have been reluctantly brought to an end. Unexpectedly, just as one wave was about to subside, another rose again. Because Hu Da felt that the public was attacking the garrison headquarters' handling of this case, he did not agree and prepared a statement of defense, demanding that each newspaper publish it on the 21st to clear the garrison headquarters' name. The Changsha Citizen's Daily, which is run by the Changsha Chamber of Commerce and has always been known for its outspokenness, has been open for two years. Although it is welcomed by the citizens, it is also envied by a few. On August 21st, the newspaper not only did not publish the statement of defense from the garrison headquarters, but also published a commentary in the spare column, titled "Another Case of Public Sex". After reading the newspaper, Hu Da was furious and personally asked He Jian to close the Citizen's Daily and arrest the chief editors on the grounds of "undermining the authority of this headquarters" and "affecting public security". If they were not arrested, he would resign himself. He Jian approved it. Hu Da immediately sent twenty to thirty soldiers to seal up the Citizen's Daily at 3:00 AM on the 22nd (that is, the evening of the 21st) and arrested the chief editor Jiang Shoushi to the garrison headquarters for questioning. After Jiang was arrested and taken to the headquarters, Chief Zhou of the Law Enforcement Office questioned Jiang about the evidence of the so-called illegal overreach of authority and abuse of torture. Jiang answered each question. After questioning, Jiang was still detained. On the morning of the 22nd, when colleagues in the press circles heard the news, they were greatly dissatisfied. They requested the New Federation to come forward and preside over the matter. The New Federation also decided to convene a joint meeting of all executive supervisors at 4:00 PM on the 22nd to discuss everything because Jiang was a member of the executive committee of the Federation. At the same time, all the news agencies in Changsha issued a declaration, stating that if the case of the Citizen's Daily could not be resolved fairly, the reporters in Changsha would be in danger. The entire industry would shut down. In addition, the colleagues in the City Chamber of Commerce decided to convene a meeting of various industries at 5:00 PM on the 22nd to discuss countermeasures because the Citizen's Daily was the mouthpiece of all the merchants and citizens. This dispute is likely to expand from here. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Guangzhou Municipal Government Forcibly Takes Over the Power Company <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>After Reorganization, It Will Be Run by the City</p>
<p>All Shareholders Express Their Opposition</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangzhou Power Company was originally a private enterprise. However, the municipal government set up a reorganization committee for the company in 1930, with three standing members, two representing the municipal government and one representing the commercial shares. The original term was set for one year, but it was extended after the term expired. Now, the municipal government suddenly directly took over the company and completely erased the shareholder rights. Therefore, all the shareholders have risen up in opposition and, since it is inconvenient to express their views in Guangzhou, they convened a general meeting of shareholders in Hong Kong to discuss countermeasures. It was found that more than 40 shareholders attended the meeting that day, and Zou Minchu was elected as the chairman. First, the chairman reported the reasons for holding the meeting in Hong Kong, and after slightly inquiring about the opinions of each shareholder on the municipal government's takeover, shareholder Mr. Lin then spoke, saying that the Guangzhou Power Company was redeemed from the hands of the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and was entirely run by Chinese merchants. The existing capital is 3 million yuan, with an additional 5 million yuan in attached capital, more than 2 million yuan in additional shares, and more than 4 million yuan in newly purchased machinery and stoves. The Guangzhou municipal government confiscated this only large-scale enterprise with a piece of paper, using evaluation as a means of easing the situation and giving back as a deceptive favor. Judging from the issuance of useless waste vouchers after the confiscation of the water company, the confiscation of the power company today will be the same. I am absolutely opposed and ask the chairman to seek public opinion and find a way to deal with it. Mr. Ma spoke, saying that the company's being taken over by the municipal government with an order is really a breach of contract. In the past, the government allowed foreign merchants to have power rights. We were afraid of the outflow of rights and used more than one million to redeem the power rights. At that time, we only had four small machines, which was a huge loss. The reason why we tried so hard to win it back was really to win glory for the country and develop industry for the people. The government should protect it, but it is instead being destroyed. How can this convince people? We should strongly oppose it and maintain the original commercial plan. Mr. Zhou spoke, saying that mentioning the power company is heartbreaking. The citizens of Guangzhou have always had a sigh of four things that are not good: the roads are uneven, the lights are not bright, and I don't know that our power company generates 10,000 degrees of electricity, but the electricity bill collected is only 3,000 degrees. This is a strange phenomenon that has never been seen in other countries. The remaining 7,000 degrees of electricity, institutions and households, connect street lines and insert power darts, and waste as much electricity as possible, which is attributed to the power company's insufficient power. Our company has worked hard and supported it for more than ten years to maintain public use for the citizens. The losses and deficits in the middle have been on the verge of bankruptcy. Since the reorganization, last year we only had a net profit of more than 500,000 yuan, and we purchased new machinery and stoves for more than 4 million yuan. The installation will be completed soon, and the power will be sufficient, and the profit will naturally be more. At this time, the government is taking the opportunity to confiscate it. The government talks about construction every day and recruits overseas Chinese to invest and set up industries in the country. Isn't this self-contradictory? Mr. Liu spoke, saying that this time, first of all, the municipal government's confiscation of the company and turning it into a city-run company can be said to be completely unreasonable, because the company has gone from losing money to making a profit since the reorganization, and there is no danger of bankruptcy. The newly purchased machines have arrived, adding 12,000 kilowatts, which can add more than 100,000 lights, and there is no shortage of power. May I ask what reason the government has to turn it into a city-run company? If it is said that public utilities should be owned by the citizens, if it is done by the citizens automatically, in a step-by-step and orderly manner, and the method of distributing additional shares is such that the real benefits are for the citizens, the colleagues will strongly agree. But now the municipal government is taking it over to be run by the city, which is not owned by the citizens. The first thing that is unreasonable is that, secondly, according to the method proposed by the municipal government, evaluation and repayment are said, but according to the custom of the business world, I am the seller and he is the buyer. The price should be negotiated by both parties, and at most, a third party should be asked to judge, which is fair. Now, the municipal government's regulations on the Asset Evaluation Committee stipulate that there are five committee members, one each from the provincial government, the municipal government, and the construction department, and another one appointed by the provincial government, for a total of four people, while the shareholder-elected representative only gets one person. According to the regulations, more than half of those present have the right to vote. In essence, it is the freedom to set the price. The second thing that is unreasonable is that, thirdly, if the municipal government does not have a reason, does not talk about reason, and carries out plundering behavior, then there is no need to say anything. Now, when it comes to evaluation and repayment, it is also necessary for the shareholders to elect a representative. It seems that it is still known that the power company has shareholders, but my power company has not gone bankrupt. The committee members, directors, and staff are all still in office and have not run away. My shareholders still hold shares. Even if we take a step back and follow the order of the municipal government and elect a representative, according to commercial law, according to the company regulations, and according to the customs of businessmen, the shareholders should have the right to convene a meeting to elect a representative by themselves. Why should the municipal government convene a meeting, set the election regulations, and restrict the share rights, changing the order to the law? From this power measurement, we can know the intention of the municipal government. The above three points are in theory. If we talk about the facts, if the municipal government has tens of millions of cash and has a deadline to redeem all the shares, the merchants can reluctantly follow it even if they suffer losses. Now, may I ask if the municipal government has this method? Looking at the confiscation of the water company, the previous lesson can be learned. In the future, a piece of bond that is not worth half a cent will be returned, and the power company with 10 million real assets will be taken over by the municipal government. How can my shareholders accept this kind of illegal, irrational, and untrustworthy behavior? Moreover, according to the proposal of the members of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Republic of China in 1930, to protect private enterprises, the privately-run Qianli Power Company shall not be confiscated, which was approved by the Fifth Congress, and there is a case to be found. Merchants should follow it. Today, my opinion is: 1. All shareholders do not accept the Guangzhou Municipal Government's order to confiscate the Guangzhou Power Company and turn it into a city-run company. 2. Ask the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, the Provincial Government, and the Municipal Government to request the cancellation of the previous order and return it to the merchants to run it themselves. 3. Appeal to the Central Executive Committee, the Executive Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry. 4. Send telegrams to electrical colleagues, industrial colleagues, and organizations from all walks of life at home and abroad to provide unified assistance. 5. From the date when the municipal government forcibly takes over the company to the date of returning it to commercial operation, the Guangzhou Municipal Government shall be responsible for compensating all losses of the company. All matters executed by the company shall not be recognized by the shareholders. All shareholder seals cannot be transferred. If there is a transfer, it will also be invalid. For all the above matters, please ask the chairman to announce and put it to a vote. After Mr. Liu finished speaking, all the shareholders stood up and agreed. The chairman then began to check the share rights of the shareholders present. The capital of Guangzhou Power Company is 3 million yuan, divided into 300,000 shares. The shareholders present hold a total of 205,883 share rights, which has exceeded two-thirds of the total number. The chairman said that in the future, no shareholder can represent everyone to express opinions or contact and be responsible for events with any party without the resolution of this meeting. This is solemnly declared, and everyone also agreed. Finally, it was resolved: (1) Unanimously and firmly declare that they do not accept the Guangzhou Municipal Government's order to confiscate the Guangzhou Power Company and turn it into a city-run company. (2) Unanimously reject the so-called shareholder election evaluation committee convened by the municipal government. All my shareholders will not report or vote. If one or two people are used by the authorities, or create qualifications, or impersonate shareholders, they will naturally be invalid according to the law, and all shareholders will not recognize them. (3) Unanimously agree with the five items proposed by Mr. Liu and hand them over to the standing staff for execution. (4) Five standing staff members of the general meeting were elected, and the meeting adjourned. In addition, two shareholders of the company, Xiao Guanying and Zou Minchu, also submitted written opinions to the general meeting of shareholders, strongly opposing the government's confiscation of the company and turning it into a city-run company without legal procedures, listing the reasons in great detail.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Recent Bandit Suppression in Western Fujian <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The 19th Route Army Prepares for a Large-Scale Campaign</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The 19th Route Army's Supplementary Brigade, led by Tan Qixiu, including the First and Third Regiments and directly subordinate units, previously stationed in Fuzhou after arriving from Guangzhou.  Currently, Deng Shizeng, Chief of Staff of the Pacification Headquarters, must travel to Zhangzhou to meet with General Commander Cai Tingkai due to important official business. He has delegated the official duties of the Headquarters to Brigade Commander Tan to handle in his absence. He departed on the Hainin steamer on the 14th for Xiamen, then on to Zhangzhou, and expects to return to the province in about two weeks. According to sources within the Pacification Headquarters, the purpose of this trip is to discuss future pacification strategies in Fujian, as well as troop deployment arrangements for northern and eastern Fujian after Brigade Commander Tan arrives in the province.  Furthermore, the newly appointed Secretary-General of the Pacification Headquarters, Sun Xiweng, also arrived in the province from Zhangzhou the other day to assume his duties. However, he plans to travel to Shanghai within the next few days to meet with Chen Mingshu to discuss matters related to the Fujian situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of suppressing the Communists, it was originally planned that the armies of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces would form a large encirclement and simultaneously launch a major general offensive, putting the Red bandits on three sides of the enemy, so as to wipe them out in one fell swoop. Currently, the 19th Route Army's division led by Shen Guanghan has arrived in Longyan, and the division led by Qu Shounian has arrived in Shanghang, both approaching the Red zone. However, the armies of Guangdong and Jiangxi have not yet reached their respective positions, so a general offensive has not yet commenced. The 19th Route Army is taking this opportunity to eliminate local bandits in the rear, reorganize local district head corps, repair blockhouses and fortresses, and build military roads in preparation for the outbreak of a major battle. As for the plan for economic blockade of the bandit areas in western Fujian, the Pacification Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Party Headquarters, the three party-government-military organs, will hold regular meetings to discuss and finalize specific measures, which will then be promulgated and implemented. Moreover, on the Red bandit side in western Fujian, Luo Bingyao is currently defending Tingzhou, with a force of over ten thousand men, while Deng Zihui is defending Longyan, with a force of only five thousand men.  Since the 19th Route Army's defenses in southern Fujian are tight, they are resorting to propaganda tactics (recently, in Jinshan and Longshan in Nan'an, Qu Division discovered a group of new recruits plotting insubordination and executed thirty-eight of them). They are probing northern Fujian with their military strength. Recently, Luo Bingyao transferred over three thousand Red Army soldiers from Tingzhou and concentrated them in Tongfang, at the intersection of Tingzhou, Liancheng, and Qingliu counties, hoping to invade Liancheng and Qingliu counties.  Lu Xingbang's division has already dispatched troops to strictly guard against this. (August 16th)</p>

<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Ministry of Finance's recent abolition of salt transportation commissioners in various regions and their merger into inspection offices is a major reform in salt administration, which can save a great deal of expenditure each year. Further active consolidation is still necessary to increase tax revenue. The Ministry of Finance has specially dispatched tax police inspectors from the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, Zhang Yuanzhen and Tang Rongtao, tax police section chief, and Zhou Zhongqi, a commissioner from the Pinghan Railway, to inspect and crack down on smuggling in various provinces. Their route takes them from Beijing, first to inspect Lianghuai, then via Haizhou to Qingdao. Yesterday, they arrived in Jinan by Jiaoji train. After arriving in Jinan, they met with Li Zhipan, manager of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office and salt transportation commissioner, and made detailed inquiries about the routes and current status of private salt smuggling. Li Zhipan, who has been in Shandong for over twenty years, is very familiar with all aspects of private salt. He reported everything in detail. Today (the 22nd) at 6:40 p.m., Zhou Zhongqi, Zhang Yuanzhen, and Tang Rongtao departed from Jinan for Tianjin on Pingpu train number 202 to inspect the situation of private salt smuggling within the Changlu territory. Then, they will go to Beiping, take the Pinghan train to Hankou, and inspect the two Hubei provinces before returning to Nanjing. (August 23rd)</p>

<p>Statistics on Deaths from Epidemic Diseases: An epidemic has been prevalent in our county since June, spreading throughout the county. As of now, according to investigations by the Public Security Bureau, there have been over three hundred deaths. Although the epidemic has subsided somewhat, there are still many cases of typhoid fever. The onset of this disease is marked by fever and chills, and after a week, the fever intensifies and rashes appear on the body. Most of the patients are women and children.</p>

<p>Case of Beating a Daughter-in-Law to Death: Exhumation and Re-examination: Gu, the daughter-in-law of Wu Haibo, who lives outside Xiaoximen, was beaten to death by her family, who falsely claimed that she had hanged herself. Her mother, Chen, petitioned the county government to exhume the body for examination on the 6th. However, the examining official, Jin Mengyu, was inexperienced and failed to determine the cause of death. Therefore, the county government petitioned the High Court to send someone to Kunshan for re-examination to ascertain the truth. On the 23rd, the High Court sent examining official Xuan Yifang to Kunshan for examination. The examination revealed numerous injuries on the deceased's left and right tibias and throughout her body, indicating that she had been beaten with wooden sticks while alive, but not fatally. The cause of death was determined to be the removal of both nipples during her lifetime, resulting in the complete redness of all the ribs, hip bones, and spine. Fortunately, the skin on her chest had not yet decomposed, so it was taken and sealed for further examination. Therefore, it is generally believed that the deceased died from having her nipples cut off while alive. Today (the 24th), the sky is clear, and another examination will be conducted in sunlight.</p>

<p>Reconstruction of the Fushan Coastal City: The Fushan Coastal City is located by the river. Due to years of disrepair, it has been collapsing. If it is not repaired, it will be difficult to prevent the emergence of sea bandits. The district office has already raised funds to hire workers for repairs, which commenced on the 22nd of this month. The work in the Gengjing area is mostly contracted out to villagers from the "Ocean Eight" village, with a labor cost of four yuan per ten zhang. The soil is excavated from a depth of two chi within the city limits and used to fill the gaps in the city walls. It is said that each team consists of about ten people, who can transport over twenty zhang per day, and the work is expected to be completed in about ten days.</p>

Although the provincial tax for the lower season of the 20th year has been explicitly exempted in full, a portion has not actually been exempted. The meeting resolved to send telegrams to the provincial authorities to strongly protest, urging that the overcollected provincial tax for the upper season of the 20th year be diverted to the labor tax for the 21st year to assist disaster victims and reflect the actual situation.</p>

<p>All Perpetrators in the Shengkang Robbery Case Apprehended: Shengkang Manor in Shaoxing Xinhe Alley previously sent its partner, Wang Rongting, to Hangzhou to collect 25,000 yuan in banknotes and silver. Upon his return to Shaoxing, he was robbed outside Jishan Gate, and the partner was shot in the leg. After the incident occurred, the manor reported it to the authorities and offered a reward of 3,000 yuan for the arrest of the perpetrators. After investigation by the detective team, it was discovered that the partner, Wang Rongting, had stolen the money himself in collusion with Shen Fu, Tian Xiaoguan, and Fu Yongquan from Dongpu. The team dispatched detectives to Dongpu, where they arrested Shen Fu and seized over 10,000 yuan in banknotes and two pistols. Furthermore, because Fu Yongquan had already fled to Suzhou with the stolen goods, the team also managed to apprehend him, recovering 13,000 yuan in banknotes. Team Leader Li went to escort them, and they were escorted to Shaoxing by two shifts of guards on the evening of the 22nd. All the perpetrators have been transferred to the court for interrogation.

<p>Complex Opinions Within the School</p>
<p>Less Than One Tenth of the Planned Projects Implemented</p>
<p>Mr. Li Siguang, Vice-Chairman of the National Central University Reorganization Committee and Acting Executive Dean, recently resigned due to difficulties in his work and came to Shanghai. He made the following remarks about his resignation:</p>
<p>I (Li, referring to himself hereafter) have no experience in educational administration and have little interest in it. This time, the Executive Yuan, due to the increasingly bad situation at National Central University, planned to thoroughly reorganize it, hence the establishment of the Reorganization Committee, and invited Mr. Cai Zimin to serve as Chairman. Despite his advanced age and busy schedule, Mr. Cai took on this difficult task, so how could I be complacent? Therefore, I reluctantly took on the role of Vice-Chairman and concurrently served as Executive Dean, hoping to share some of Mr. Cai's burden. However, within two months of taking office, difficulties arose, and opinions within the school were complex. I, personally weak and lacking in talent, was overwhelmed with dealing with them. Less than one-tenth of the Reorganization Committee's planned projects were implemented. At that time, I wanted to share Mr. Cai's burden and take on this matter, but the result was that I not only failed to share Mr. Cai's burden but also increased his worries. Therefore, I decided to resign from my position as Vice-Chairman of the Reorganization Committee and Executive Dean. Mr. Cai and other members of the Reorganization Committee, because the Reorganization Committee was originally an advisory and planning body and should not interfere excessively in the school's internal administration, also decided to resign en masse and requested the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to appoint a president as soon as possible to focus on administration. It is fortunate for the future of National Central University that the Reorganization Committee has approved the resignation of its members and appointed Mr. Luo Zhixi as President, so that there is now someone responsible for school administration.</p>

<p>(Notes) (1) The senior high school curriculum standards also stipulate three tables. The first table is entirely for compulsory subjects.

<p>The private Renren Elementary School in Yonganli, Zhoujiazui Road, Public Concession, was found by the Municipal Bureau of Education to be corrupt in its operations. The principal, Liu Zhiyao, along with Jin Sicheng, a resident of the neighborhood, initiated donations for a Taoist ritual, promoting superstition. The school's signboard also falsely claimed to be approved for registration by the Municipal Bureau of Education. The Bureau has now sent a letter to the First Special District Court to ban it. Record of the Bureau Meeting of the Shanghai County Bureau of Education: The Shanghai County Bureau of Education held its 255th Bureau Meeting yesterday morning. Those present were Director Shi, Inspector Zhu, Zheng Guozhai, Yang Huiming, Lin Weiwen, Niu Zhiyi, Shen Jingzhi, Yan Chongguang, Xi Siwu, and Wu Jianqing. Director Shi presided, and Ling Sheng-san recorded. The ceremony was as usual. Matters for Report: Omitted. Matters for Discussion: (1) The order from the Department to draft measures for rectifying elementary schools in this county was discussed. It was decided to have the two education committee members Lin and Niu, along with Yang Huiming, draft it and submit it to the next meeting for discussion. (2) Omitted. (3) The transfer of Lu Youyu to be the principal of Peicai Elementary School and Zhou Fengqi to be the principal of Chegou Elementary School was discussed and approved. (4) The Minhang Central Elementary School's request for temporary funds was discussed.

(5) Education Committee Member Lin forwarded the request from Jiang Shichun, the principal of Lidong Elementary School, for a salary increase and promotion. It was decided that since he served as a teacher at Yangsi Third School in the spring of 1928 and was not transferred by the Bureau's order, it was considered an interruption, and the request could not be approved for the time being. (6) Education Committee Member Lin forwarded the request from the principal of Yupei Elementary School to hire additional teachers. It was decided that it violated Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations for the Establishment of County Elementary Schools in Jiangsu Province, and it was difficult to approve. The meeting adjourned. The Citywide Labor School Starts Today: The Shanghai Municipal Workers' Education Committee has established thirteen labor schools. Since their opening last autumn, they have been in operation for over a year, with a total of more than 1,500 students. Their performance has been excellent, and they have been deeply trusted by the public. The Standing Committee members of the Committee, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Xu Peihuang, and others, considering that there are too many out-of-school children of laborers in Shanghai and the existing schools are insufficient to accommodate them, have expanded greatly this semester, adding two schools in Huadong Yangzhou Road and Washington Road, and appointing Shen Jingzhen and Shen Zhuanxian as the principals of the fourteenth and fifteenth schools. The fourth school in Gonghe Road, Zhabei, has been relocated to No. 56 Shishoufang, Qingyun Road, due to its unsuitable location, and Zhang Zimei has been appointed as the principal. It is reported that all schools will start classes today (the 25th). If there are out-of-school children of laborers who have not yet enrolled, they must quickly register at nearby schools to avoid missing the opportunity. Efforts of the Huisheng Midwifery School: The Huisheng Midwifery Women's Medical School at No. 130 Beinicheng Bridge, Aiwanyi Road, this city, since being approved for registration by the Municipal Bureau of Education, the school's principal, Shi Ruxiong, and the dean of academic affairs, Ye Zhisheng, have been making great efforts in planning school affairs. In addition to the original professors of various departments, the school has also appointed Dr. Zeng Baohan, an American medical doctor, as the professor of obstetrical surgery and the director of the Huisheng Civilian Obstetrics Hospital, which is affiliated with the school; Dr. Tang Shouxian, former professor of Nanyang Medical University, as the professor of anatomy and physiology; Dr. Luo Minxiu as the professor of diagnostics; and Dr. Lu Yijun as the professor of obstetrics. It is reported that more than 40 new students have been recruited this semester, and more than 20 students have transferred from other schools. The school's second branch in Dachang was destroyed by Japanese aircraft during the Shanghai war. The school authorities have now found a new site for the second branch in the central district of the concession.

Record of the First World International Recreation Congress (First World International Recreation Congress): Motivation for the Conference: The World Olympic Games, in view of the overemphasis on the competitive nature of sports, cannot encompass the true value of physical education. Therefore, there is a special establishment of the General Physical Education Committee. Four years ago, the Committee advocated the promotion of popular physical education and sports fields. All countries in the world followed suit, recognizing this theory as necessary. To date, formal national sports associations have been established in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Finland, and Italy. The American National Sports Association (a government organization managed by the public) took the opportunity of the Tenth World Games to invite countries to hold the First World Sports Conference in Los Angeles, USA, one week before the Games. Opening of the Conference: The conference began on July 23. The first item on the agenda was the opening ceremony of the Olympic Swimming Pool, attended by more than 40,000 people. The program was novel, and representatives of various sports fields in Los Angeles joined in the performance, with a definite number of more than 2,000 people. Among them, the extremely high-level fancy diving was the most brilliant. Due to the strong interest in the performance, the formal conference did not begin until the next morning. The conference included a congratulatory message from the President of the United States, and three people were invited to speak. I was among those invited to report on the general physical education situation in China on the first morning. All countries expressed their welcome. After the meeting, representatives from various countries rushed to talk to me, seemingly wanting to know more about the situation in China as quickly as possible. I was very pleased and did my best to win a place for our country in the conference. Conference Situation: Every morning at 9:00, small group meetings were held first to discuss various issues related to sports. At 11:00, a general meeting was held. In the afternoon at 2:00, small group meetings were held again. In the evening, there were social gatherings or lectures by famous people. Miss Case of Jinling University and I were in the same group for meetings, and Mr. Liu Xuesong was in another group. The topics of discussion were not limited to sports, such as literature, art, music, drama, women's sports, how to spend leisure time, and statistical methods, etc., were all within the scope. Future Plans: The Advisory Committee has a total of 34 national units, and China is one of them. The next conference is scheduled to be held in Berlin in 1936 and will be hosted by the Berlin Sports Association. I hope that the people of our country and our government will recognize that this kind of promotion is in line with the world trend. If the government and the public can cooperate to promote it, and realize the organization of the National Sports Association, as well as sports fields, etc., and make them universal, then our culture and sports will reflect each other with the European and American countries, and be equally beautiful. (Note) Regarding the detailed situation of the First World Sports Conference, it has been published in the Los Angeles correspondence of this newspaper on the 23rd. The above only describes the general situation.</p>

<p>Local News: Chen and Zhu Urge Song to Return to Beijing: No Meeting at Song's Residence Yesterday: Since arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, Finance Minister Song Ziwen has repeatedly met with Mei Lehe, Zhang Fuyun, and the banking community in this city to discuss important issues such as sealing off Northeast customs duties and levying paper currency issuance tax. After the Central Committee's talk meeting passed Song's appointment as acting president of the Executive Yuan, the central government sent Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan and Education Minister Zhu Jiahua to Shanghai yesterday morning to urge Song to return to Beijing. Chen and Zhu Arrive in Shanghai to Urge His Return: Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan and Education Minister Zhu Jiahua arrived in Shanghai at around 8 a.m. yesterday. After arriving in Shanghai, Chen drove to visit Finance Minister Song at around 10 a.m. to urge Song to return to Beijing as soon as possible to preside over national affairs. Chen left at around 11 a.m. Zhu visited Song at around 1 p.m. yesterday, but Song was out and did not meet him. He then went again at around 5 p.m. to urge his return. Those Who Visited Song Yesterday: Those who visited Song yesterday included Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan in the morning, urging Song to go to Beijing, and Zhang Gongquan and Li Fusun from the banking community, discussing the issue of paper currency issuance tax. In the afternoon, there was Education Minister Zhu Jiahua, whose mission was the same as Navy Minister Chen. Finance Vice Minister Zou Lin, former Finance Vice Minister Zhang Shouyong, Jianghai Customs Superintendent Tang Haian, Salt Affairs Commissioner Zhu Tingqi, discussing financial issues. Weijingzhou, director of the mint, contacted the factory's affairs, and Ge Jingen, Zhou Xiangxian, and others. However, there were no meetings of any kind at Song's residence yesterday. Finance Minister Song Will Fly to Beijing Today: According to the National News Agency, according to banking circles, Finance Minister Song decided to fly from Shanghai to Beijing by plane today (the 25th) to report on the progress to the central government and attend various important meetings, as the banking community has agreed to lend 2 million yuan for use. Chen Shaokuan's Remarks: According to the Central News Agency, Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at around 8 a.m. yesterday. According to the Central News Agency reporter, "I have resigned and am awaiting orders from the central government. The task of coming to Shanghai, in addition to urging Mr. Song to return to Beijing to act as the president of the Executive Yuan, is also to handle the affairs of the Jiangnan Shipyard. I will return to Beijing in about two or three days." The Banking Community Urges the Postponement of the Paper Currency Tax, Intending to Reduce the Tax Rate: It Can Be Established After the Mortgage Loan is Resolved: According to the Central News Agency, the banking community in this city believes that the Ministry of Finance's levy of a 2.5% paper currency issuance tax on reserve guarantees is too high and cannot be borne. Therefore, it sent representatives such as Zhang Gongquan to meet with the authorities of the Ministry of Finance, urging them to reduce the tax rate and postpone the collection. After several consultations, the Ministry of Finance indicated that it was difficult to agree to reduce the tax rate, but it seemed that it could be done to postpone the collection. However, this tax revenue must be mortgaged to the banking community. According to the banking community, the mortgage matter can be complied with, but the paper currency issuance tax rate must be reduced. The various situations are recorded as follows: Focusing on Reducing the Tax Rate: Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter visited a certain person in the banking community in this city and asked about the results of the urging to postpone the paper currency issuance tax. According to the conversation, the banking community, due to the current poor financial situation, sent representatives to the authorities of the Ministry of Finance to request a postponement of the paper currency issuance tax. After repeated consultations, the postponement issue is no longer the focus of the problem. The banking community's urging to the Ministry of Finance for postponement is indeed a major point of request, but the banking community believes that the 2.5% tax rate for the paper currency issuance tax reserve guarantee is too high and must be reduced according to the circumstances. This is the biggest point of request. The banking community deeply understands that the request for postponement is a temporary issue, while the request to reduce the tax rate is a permanent and fundamental issue. If the Ministry of Finance can agree to reduce the tax rate, the banking community would be happy to hear it even if it does not agree to the postponement. The Mortgage is Not a Problem: Regarding the mortgage of the paper currency tax to the banking community in this city, the banking community stated that taxation and mortgage are two different issues and cannot be discussed together. Mortgage has a repayment date, while taxation is levied without return. If the Ministry of Finance has financial difficulties and mortgages to the banking community, the banking community will certainly be able to assist within its capacity, as lending for profit is a type of business for the banking community. If the paper currency issuance tax is used as a mortgage, it can be established as long as the problem of reducing the tax rate is resolved. There is a Natural Solution: Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter also inquired from former Finance Vice Minister Zhang Shouyong. According to Zhang, "I have now resigned from the position of Finance Vice Minister. It is rumored that I am currently a consultant to the Ministry of Finance, but this is a rumor. This time, the consultations with the banking community were entirely to help Minister Song out of friendship, not as a representative of Minister Song. I visited Minister Song at 3 p.m. on the 6th (yesterday) and did not discuss this issue. However, I understand that the banking community has made appropriate solutions for the Ministry of Finance's urging to postpone and reduce the tax rate. The issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan is still under discussion." Bombs and Shells Found in the French Concession Yesterday Morning: Bomb Warning to Traitorous Merchants: Where the Shell Came From is Unknown: At around 7 a.m. yesterday morning, a group to eliminate traitors was found warning a printing house on Caishi Road, leaving behind a hand grenade. At around 8 a.m., a shell was found in a garage on Guba Road. Neither place exploded, so no one was injured. Both shells have now been taken away by the police for investigation. Yun Huifang's Bail Appeal to the Police Station Rejected: In the case of Yun Huifang, the First Special District Court ruled at the second hearing that Yun could be released on bail with a reliable shop as security. The lawyer from the Public Works Department who prosecuted at the time appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court after the objection was invalid. It is now known that the Second Branch of the High Court posted a notice on the 23rd rejecting the appeal of the Public Works Department. The Strange Organization of the Red-Clad Security Corps: Intended to Disrupt Patriotic Movements: Attracted the Attention of the Chinese Concession Authorities: According to Wenwen News Agency, since various patriotic organizations have been active in recent days, traitorous merchants have been greatly panicked. Therefore, the so-called Red-Clad Security Corps, an opposing organization, has been discovered. Yesterday, it even sent letters to various organizations. It is said that the original letter stated absurd words, and its intention was nothing more than to buy a group of ignorant and foolish people from a certain country, distribute letters, and attempt to intimidate the traitor-eliminating corps from proceeding. It has now attracted the attention of the Chinese Concession authorities. The Japanese Police Corps Organized by Ronin Began Activities Yesterday: To Deal with Various Traitor-Eliminating Corps: According to Shiwenshe News Agency, the "Japanese Police Corps," which was jointly organized and established by various Japanese ronin organizations, held an emergency meeting at the same document school on the night of the bomb incident at the Asian Library (the 22nd) to discuss countermeasures. As a result, it was unanimously advocated that all members of the "Japanese Police Corps" should be divided into three teams: "patrol," "reconnaissance," and "protection," each team with 20 people, to carry out activities in the Hongkou and North Sichuan Road areas starting from that day. Therefore, yesterday, there were traces of such people in the Hongkou and North Sichuan Road areas, walking back and forth in groups of three or two. There were also members of the "protection team" organized by the corps stationed at the entrances of various Japanese shops, paying close attention to Chinese pedestrians. [PLarge Quantities of Silk and Tea Transported to Europe: Large Value of Cash Transported to the United States: The revival of the export of Huzhou silk has been recorded in this newspaper before. Now, there is also a slight way to Europe. The first batch was loaded out yesterday. Tea exports have also picked up slightly. Banks in Shanghai are also transporting a large amount of gold coins to the United States. The various reports are summarized as follows: First Huzhou Silk Shipment to Europe: The silk industry in Shanghai has gradually become active since the government exempted taxes and implemented subsidies for export silk losses. Recently, French merchants in Shanghai purchased a large batch of Huzhou silk, which was shipped to Marseille and other places by the British Shipping Company's mail ship "Lombardia" yesterday, totaling 905 pieces, worth 500,000 yuan in national currency. This is the largest first batch of Huzhou silk transported to Europe. Green Tea Shipped to the UK and France: China tea exports to Europe have become active. Yesterday, the British ship "Lombardia" carried a total of 10,800 boxes of green tea, worth approximately one million yuan. This tea is the largest batch of China tea exports this year, intended to be discharged in London and France. Large Value of Cash Transported to the United States: The Central Bank of this city recently shipped a large batch of physical gold coins to the United States. According to the report, the "Mackenzie Lykes" wheel shipped gold bars and gold coins worth 400,000 US dollars last Friday. Yesterday, the "President Taft" wheel exported gold bars and gold coins worth 370,000 US dollars. The total value of the gold coins exported is more than 3 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Navigation Information During the Hurricane <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Observation of the Direction of the Hurricane</p>
<p>General Report on Import and Export Vessels</p>
<p>A strong wind occurred in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and all seagoing vessels did not export. This matter has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Surprisingly, the Xujiahui Observatory reported yesterday that the hurricane was still advancing towards Wenzhou Ocean. The Shanghai-Ningbo wheels continue to be suspended and have not opened, and there is no import. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Direction of the Hurricane: According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday, today's hurricane blew from Taitung and proceeded very quickly along the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang. The wind system first arrived at Wenzhou Ocean and then changed direction, proceeding to Fuzhou, and will land from Fuzhou. The Wusong mouth will also be affected, and so on.</p>
<p>Ningbo Wheels Not Open: The Xuyuong class New Jiangtianningxing vessels of the previous day were not open due to strong winds. Sanbei Company originally planned to supplement the Tiangingxing wheel for export yesterday. At around 12 o'clock, they received a warning from the observatory that strong winds would continue, and immediately stopped Tiangingxing's export. On the one hand, the electrical signal reached Ningbo Bureau, saying, "The wind is not over, and Tianningxing is not open. The travelers who refunded their tickets the day before yesterday came to the ship yesterday, thinking they could take the wheel, but unexpectedly the second suspension, everyone refunded and returned again. However, the Wenzhou shift, the Shanghai-Taiwan shift, and the Chongming shift each wheel normally exited from 5 pm</p>
<p>No Import of Sea Wheels: The various sea wheels that were blocked by the big wind the day before yesterday still failed to come to Shanghai because the wind was not over yesterday, so yesterday only four Yangtze River wheels sailed into Huangpu. Except for the imports of Yihe's Dingsheng wheel, the rest were several foreign ships, which arrived at Wusong before the hurricane started. As for the Nanyang shifts and other wheels of various wheel companies, which were stopped by the hurricane on the sea surface, there were more than twenty vessels, and all of them failed to close, and they must all reach Shen today.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Research on Reconstruction Plans for War Zones <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Arranging Public Buildings Requires 3 Million</p>
<p>Building Roads Requires 2.8 Million</p>
<p>And Expanding the Shanghai-Songhu Railway and Constructing Wharves</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, the essence of our city's war zones was almost completely destroyed, with Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong suffering the most severe damage. The Municipal Government instructed the Public Works Bureau of this city to draft a reconstruction plan for the war zones. Now, the said recovery project plan has been drafted and submitted to the Municipal Government for referral to the Special Committee Group of the Shanghai War Zone Reconstruction Committee for research and reference. The details of the plan are as follows:</p>
<p>Arranging Public Buildings. After the war, public buildings were completely destroyed, hence the plan for arrangement. Regarding the Zhabei District, Baoshan Road, Baoxing Road, Gonghe Xin Road, and Song Park Road will be built, requiring a total of 450,000 yuan. The construction of ditches on Baoxing Road, Song Park Road, and Gonghe Xin Road requires 200,000 yuan. Approximately 250,000 yuan is needed to add bridges on the Wusong River. The construction of revetments costs 200,000 yuan, the construction of wharves costs 150,000 yuan, the construction of vegetable markets costs 100,000 yuan, and the construction of civilian residences costs 150,000 yuan, totaling 1.5 million yuan. Regarding the Wusong District, repairing the roads in Wusong Town and Wai Ma Road costs 120,000 yuan, the construction of ditches costs 80,000 yuan, the construction of bridges costs 100,000 yuan, vegetable markets and civilian residences cost 50,000 yuan, the arrangement of the Huangpu River bank costs 100,000 yuan, and wharves cost 50,000 yuan, totaling 500,000 yuan. Regarding the Jiangwan District, the arrangement of Xinshi Government Road and Jiangwan Town roads costs 100,000 yuan, the construction of ditches costs 80,000 yuan, the construction of bridges in the Jiangwan District costs 120,000 yuan, the arrangement of revetments costs 50,000 yuan, and civilian residences and vegetable markets each cost 50,000 yuan, totaling 400,000 yuan. Regarding the Yinxiang District, the construction of Linping Road, Tianbao Road, and Quanjia'an costs 120,000 yuan, the construction of ditches costs 50,000 yuan, the construction of the Shajing Port Bridge costs 80,000 yuan, and the construction of civilian residences and vegetable markets costs 50,000 yuan, totaling 300,000 yuan. Regarding the Zhenru District, the construction of roads in Zhenru Town costs 100,000 yuan, the construction of ditches costs 50,000 yuan, the construction of bridges costs 100,000 yuan, and civilian residences and vegetable markets cost 50,000 yuan, totaling 300,000 yuan. The above four districts require a total of 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Building Major Transportation Arteries. There are seven major transportation arteries to be built: (1) Zhongshan Road. Since Zhongshan South Road has already been built, this road will connect the southern city to the northern city. Zhongshan North Road will extend from Wusong to Baoshan Township and connect with the South Road. The entire road is 11,300 meters long and requires 400,000 yuan. (2) Song Park Road and Zha-Yang Road. Song Park Road is related to the road from Zhabei to Yangxing. These two roads extend from Zhabei through Miaohang to Yangxing, totaling 12,500 meters in length and requiring 100,000 yuan. (3) Zhenchang Road. The Shanghai-Tai Road extends from Zhenru to Dachang, and from Zhabei, Shanghai to Liuhe, it is 12,500 feet long and requires 350,000 yuan. (4) Shangda Road and Shi-Nan Road. This road extends east through Yinhang to Pubin and west to Zhongshan Road in Miaohang, connecting to Zhabei and Yangxing. It is 9,500 meters long and requires 300,000 yuan. (5) Yunzaobang South Road. This road runs horizontally through the central urban area, with the industrial area to the north and the new commercial port to the south, extending east to Zhongshan Road and west to Shanghai-Tai Road. It is 8,800 feet long and requires 250,000 yuan. (6) Song-Yang Road. It extends from Wusong to Yangxing, is 5,400 meters long, and requires 200,000 yuan. This road connects with Zha-Yang Road. (7) Song-Bao Road connects with Song-Yang Road, bypasses the fort Taiwanese station, and reaches Baoshan. It is 2,500 meters long and requires 100,000 yuan. The total length of roads to be built is 79,000 feet, costing a total of 2.8 million yuan. Expand the Shanghai-Songhu Railway. The Shanghai-Songhu Railway is of great importance to the reconstruction of the war zone. Therefore, the Municipal Government plans to add four branch lines to the Shanghai-Songhu line: A. From the north to Hujiazhuang, through Yunzaobang to Wusong, connecting with the current line. B. From Dachang, north through Miaohang, then east along the Goose ____ Puli Changhe Hydroelectric Plant, and to the bank of the Pujiang River, connecting with the Qiujiang Wharf. C. From Dachang eastward, ending at the west end of Sanmin Road, establishing the central urban general station here. D. Developing from Zhenru towards Song Park Road. The first priority is to complete Line B, so that the central urban area plan can be realized.</p>
<p>Building Qiujiang Wharf. Qiujiang Wharf extends along the Huangpu River and is adjacent to the central urban area. Because currently, merchant ships from various countries cannot enter the Huangpu River port, the water depth of Qiujiang Wharf is deeper and can accommodate ships with heavier tonnage. The construction of this wharf will be divided into three phases. The first phase of construction is a pile-frame wooden wharf, requiring 5.18 million yuan. The second phase of construction requires 4.65 million yuan. The third phase of construction is the completion phase, requiring 4.34 million yuan. After the construction is completed in the future, all merchant ships can dock, and the central urban area will become a direct transportation commercial port.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Report from the Liaodong Self-Defense Army <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Huang Yuzhou, Tang Juwu, and others from the General Headquarters of the Liaodong People's Self-Defense Army, received front-line reports from Ning yesterday, which are summarized as follows: (1) On August 15th, two Japanese civil engineering supervisors working on the railway bridge between Ying'emen and Shuiliandong on the Shenhai Line were captured by our army's 600-man broadsword team. (2) At 5:00 PM on August 16th, a Japanese scout was fishing in the Taizi River east of Benxihu and was killed by the Self-Defense Army. (3) Also on the same day at night, more than 300 cavalrymen from our Self-Defense Army launched a large-scale attack from the Qianshan Station south of Anshan. After more than 30 minutes of fighting, the Japanese police team was unable to withstand the attack and retreated, urgently reporting to the Fengtian Japanese garrison team, which then engaged in a fierce battle for more than two hours. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack, and the newly appointed President Lin Man fled to Anshan Station. Our Liaodong Self-Defense Army then occupied Qianshan Station. In this battle, 37 Japanese police officers were killed, and the number of wounded is unknown. Our side suffered 8 casualties, and obtained 25 rifles and more than 380 rounds of ammunition. (4) On the night of August 17th, more than 500 cavalrymen from our Self-Defense Army attacked between the Nantai Station and Tanggangzi on the main line of the South Manchuria Railway, cutting off all telegraph and telephone lines. The next day, they surrounded Nantai Station and attacked the Japanese garrison team, police team, and self-defense corps. The Haicheng and Anshan garrison teams provided field artillery support, and after six hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated. Both sides suffered heavy losses in this battle. Our Self-Defense Army is still preparing to attack. (5) On August 18th, our Self-Defense Army is taking advantage of the obstruction of the green gauze tents, and is attacking the railway between Dashiqiao and Liaoyang at any time, destroying telegraphs and telephones, which are all out of service. The Japanese enemy is quite exhausted and struggling to cope. Further reports will follow.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Pan Yunchao's Speech on the Northeast Issue <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Speech at the Chaozhou Fellow Association</p>
<p>The Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Association and the Moral Education Group of the Four Virtues National Salvation Corps specially invited Mr. Pan Yunchao, a member of the Central Committee, to give a public lecture at the Fellow Association yesterday, which was held at 4:00 PM. More than 300 members attended. The meeting began with an introductory speech by Chairman Zheng Zhengqiu, who briefly stated: "Our group's Moral Education Group originally had lecture regulations, but due to the hot weather, we planned to hold them in the autumn. However, thinking of the Northeast volunteer army resisting the brutal Japanese army in this terrible summer, vowing to wash away the national humiliation with hot blood and fight for the lost land, we are in this difficult time for the country, and how dare we be afraid of the heat? Therefore, we are holding it early. Mr. Pan Yunchao's morality and articles are admired by our fellow villagers. This time, he was entrusted by Mr. Zhu Jiqing to preside over the rear affairs of the Northeast National Salvation Army. He must be deeply familiar with the situation in the Northeast, and our fellow villagers especially hope that he can tell us about the recent situation in the Northeast." Then, Mr. Pan Chaoyun gave a lecture (the long speech is recorded separately). Subsequently, Zheng Zhengqiu, Weng Ziguang, and others gave speeches with many words of encouragement. The meeting ended at around 6:00 PM. The following is Mr. Pan's speech:</p>
<p>Please, your association has enthusiastically helped me with the Northeast matters. Before I speak, I must express my gratitude. Today, I am honored to be invited by your association to give a lecture on the Northeast issue. With such a serious and complex Northeast, I know very little and cannot contribute much. I feel very sorry. Now, I will only briefly say that the Northeast incident is of great international importance. Japan, Soviet Russia, and even the United States are very complex. In a very short period of time, it is impossible to say everything. Now, let me first talk about Japan's conspiracy. Decades ago, Japan had an organization called the Black Dragon Society. The members of the society included politicians, soldiers, statesmen, and rogues. Its only principle was to invade China, not only in military and economic aspects, but also by adopting various methods and doing everything possible to invade. Taking advantage of the government's psychology and grasping the weaknesses of society, every civil war background must have Japanese people manipulating behind the scenes. Therefore, China has historically had many internal strife, politics is not on track, and society is so chaotic, directly and indirectly, all of which are affected by the Japanese. This time, we knew early on that their invasion and occupation of the Northeast was a consistent plan. Their entire proposition is to destroy China and even annex China. This is something that should be recognized first. Japan's invasion and occupation of the Northeast is not only for the Northeast, but also for the area north of the Yellow River, just like the previous invasion and occupation of Goryeo, the purpose is actually the Northeast in general. However, why did he not come out earlier? It is not because he is afraid of China, but because of international relations, afraid of offending the public. Now he sees clearly that the world economy is depressed, unable to take care of himself, and unanimously says that no country will unilaterally oppose Japan, and cannot unite to deal with it, while China is unable to resist, so he brazenly invaded at this time. This is something that should be recognized second. As for the origin of the Northeast Volunteer Army, it is not inherent, but because Japan occupied the Northeast, cut off and monopolized transportation, and divided it into many fragments. The Red Beard bandits in the Northeast are rampant everywhere, so the people have weapons at home for defense. Japan is not afraid of the Chinese government, but only of the people of the Northeast. He painstakingly wants to collect their weapons, which has caused a lot of resentment, because without weapons there is no guarantee, so they are greatly panicked and strive to resist. Furthermore, there are many enemies of the traitors, who often falsely report that a certain village has volunteer army firearms. The Japanese surrounded the village and killed old and young without mercy. The people felt that their own lives were in danger, and they became more united to seek self-defense. Therefore, before the establishment of the Volunteer Army and the National Salvation Army, there were countless times of scattered resistance. Because they are not the government's formal army, people call them the Volunteer Army. After the establishment of anti-Japanese groups in various places, they felt the pain of ununified command, so they united themselves. However, seeing the Volunteer Army representatives from Shanghai, claiming to be commanders-in-chief, there are already as many as seven people. Don't be pessimistic, this is a good phenomenon, because traffic is occupied, mountains are blocked, and the unity of each fragment is actually impossible. I am only afraid that the people will not rise up. As long as they rise up to resist, no matter if he is a commander or a commander-in-chief, it is always a good phenomenon. I am entrusted by Zhu Jiqing to handle the rear affairs of the Northeast National Salvation Army. Mr. Zhu is a person with a lot of history. He returned from studying in Japan in Xinhai and has been constantly running around for the revolution in his hometown of Liaoning. He has been active in the anti-Yuan protection law and other battles. He is a person who only knows how to do things and is not good at talking, so his name has never been prominent. This spring, he was living in Tianjin and, out of a sense of duty, was determined to go out of the pass to save the country. The volunteer army outside the pass also sent letters back and forth, inviting him to preside over the command. He went out of the pass with a serious illness, endured hardships, and did not avoid dangers. As a Central Committee member who was accustomed to living a privileged life, he ate cold water-soaked sorghum and walked six or seventy miles of mountain roads every day. It is naturally commendable. When he returned to Tianjin, I almost didn't recognize him. Haggard, dark, and skinny, he also had dysentery. But he was always very happy in his heart. He originally went to find a place to die, but now he is not only not dead, but also sees that he can do great things, so he is very excited to fight for a long time and goes around asking for help. The Northeast Volunteer Army has guns and blood, but what is lacking is insufficient ammunition. Although, they can also buy some from the Japanese and the traitors, but for the sake of the whole plan, it is still necessary to give thorough assistance. From the news of the Volunteer Army, we know the general situation of their work in the newspapers. It is indeed possible to do great things. Now there is a whole new plan, but I cannot announce it. In the near future, there may be very amazing and gratifying news that will spread to us. This is something to be comforted by everyone. Mr. Zhu is from the Northeast and is a subjugated slave. I am from Hebei and am a prepared subjugated slave. You may be the third or fourth candidate subjugated slaves. Japan's invasion of China is not a local issue, but a whole strategy. We must resist with all our strength. I hope everyone will rise up and work hard, work hard to help Mr. Zhu, work hard to help the subjugated slaves in the Northeast, and work hard to save the entire China that has not yet been subjugated.</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Jiangnan Embankment Project Has Been Completed <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Rehabilitation Committee Prepares to Conclude</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Embankment Rehabilitation Committee sent letters yesterday to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and related agencies such as the Construction Department and the Public Works Department, stating: "Since the beginning of our committee's organization, after the end of the Shanghai war, both public and private sectors have been in difficulty, and fundraising has been difficult. However, the timing is pressing, and all surveys and designs have not been able to be carefully planned. The members have their own professions, and their energy has not been able to be concentrated. Over the past five months, we have been deeply concerned about failure. Fortunately, the government authorities are concerned about the people's livelihood and deeply understand the importance of embankment work. The huge allocation of funds is unprecedented since the Republic of China, and the employees are also able to understand the government's intentions, encourage diligence, and be impartial. The committee members rely on the assistance of the financial community and are also able to fulfill their responsibility of lending a hand to share the burden, so that the employees can work with peace of mind. Now, 80 to 90% of the completed projects will be completed as scheduled in mid-September. This is what the committee members can report to the government and local elders. However, the Jiangnan embankment has been in disrepair for a long time. The first survey by the committee members actually required 3 million yuan to complete the symptomatic treatment project. However, due to limited funds, the completed projects only account for a quarter of the original plan. The committee members have repeatedly visited the construction site for supervision and inspection, and the dangers are becoming more apparent. We deeply feel that the previous survey of the project was not exhaustive, and the current completed projects are too far from the actual situation. This year's tide season has passed more than half, and fortunately, no major dangerous projects have occurred. This is due to the tireless patrols of the employees, and the fact that the wind and tide have not been severe, which is the biggest reason. Looking ahead to next year, we have deep concerns. If the survey work cannot be completed uniformly in the years to come, and the annual maintenance costs cannot be guaranteed every year, then the residents of Songhu will always have the suffering of fainting and the danger of drowning. The committee members' meeting and organization are temporary. Now, as the completed projects are about to be completed, we should immediately prepare for the conclusion and have already reported it in another case. In the future, raising huge amounts of money and continuing to carry out major projects will make the embankment permanent and the people's livelihood secure. We can only rely on the government to supervise, and permanent institutions to make overall plans and take care of all aspects to comfort the people. All the projects that have not been surveyed and repaired by the committee are copied with a list and sent for inspection."</p>
<h3 id="e130">All Sectors in Shanghai West Organize Committee to Promote Dredging After Puhuitang's Siltation <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Electing Ma Xiangbo and 12 Others as Committee Members</p>
<p>Puhuitang in Shanghai West is silted up, which hinders the people's livelihood and should be dredged urgently. The parks in the area specially invited the Song Qing Municipal Government and the gentry along the pond to discuss solutions. A meeting was held on August 22nd at Sanshantang to discuss. Shen Yi, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau (represented by Liu Yuecang), Fang Erkang, Director of the Qingpu County Construction Bureau, Xu Baikui, Director of the Songjiang County Construction Bureau (represented by Wu Zhaosheng), Hu Lifu of Fahua, Gu Rungui, Pan Boxian, Wang Shenyuan, Jiang Jusheng of Pusong, Yang Fuyuan of Caojing, Wu Yuqing, Li Wenlai of Sijing, Zhang Yande, and Zhang Weicheng, Shen Caigeng, etc., publicly elected Zhang Weicheng as the chairman. First, the chairman reported, followed by a report by the representative of the Municipal Public Works Bureau on the measurement process. The directors of the Qingpu Construction Bureau and the representatives of the Songjiang Construction Bureau successively reported, all saying that if the river water is so smelly, it is not enough to benefit the people's livelihood if the municipal government is not asked to dredge it at the same time. The chairman then read a letter from Mr. Ma Xiangbo, proposing to open a small gate from the west of Longhua Baibu Bridge to Jiuli'an, and a written opinion from Mr. Wang Dianxian. After discussion, it was decided that to avoid the smell, it is necessary to change the route. The proposal to change the route should be submitted to the municipal government for approval. A committee to promote the dredging of Puhuitang was established on the spot, and Ma Xiangbo, Yang Binghang, Chen Yafu, Yang Fuyuan, Zhang Weicheng, and other thirteen people were elected as members to request the municipal government to dredge it together to benefit farmers and merchants and to comfort the public.</p>

<p>One Hundred and Thirty-Two Arrived in Shanghai by Steamer the Night Before Last</p>
<p>Immediately Assigned to Work in Shanghai and Hangzhou by the General Affairs Department</p>
<p>Postal employees from the three northeastern provinces, since entering the pass one after another, have gathered in Tianjin, numbering over a thousand. The local postal workers' and staff associations, together with colleagues from the Liaoning District Postal Staff Club's Tianjin office, have tried to accommodate them, but it's still not enough. They telegraphed the National Postal Workers' Union and the National Postal Union, requesting them to report to the General Administration and arrange for placement in the south. At 7 PM the day before yesterday, Jardine Matheson's steamer "Tingsang" arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin, carrying 132 postal employees from the Northeast. The Shanghai Administration Director, Chapin, and the specially appointed Postal Commissioner, Wu Yu, braved the rain to welcome them at Jardine Matheson Wharf in Yangshupu. After disembarking, the postal employees were transported directly to the Jingwu Athletic Association's rest area in Fudeli, Yokohama Bridge, by postal delivery vehicles. At 12 PM yesterday, all employees went to the Shanghai Postal Administration on Sichuan Road Bridge to meet Postal Commissioner Chapin, specially appointed Postal Commissioner Wu Yu, and Deputy Postal Commissioner Wu. They also submitted a report. Chapin then reported to the General Administration, which had already assigned placement arrangements through the General Affairs Department. Eighty-six employees were assigned to Shanghai, and thirty-six were assigned to the General Administration. A reporter from the Datong News Agency visited the employees at the athletic association yesterday afternoon. According to them, most of them had entered the pass last month. They had been in Tianjin for two weeks and finally boarded a ship in Tanggu on the 19th of this month to come to Shanghai. All the employees' families are still in Tianjin. According to evening news, the employees assigned to work in Hangzhou have already received orders from the General Administration, instructing them to report to the Hangzhou office tomorrow morning (today) by taking the early train from the South Station.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Son Posthumously Names Father a Traitorous Merchant <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Mitsui Comprador Gu Zhenxian</p>
<p>Repeatedly Scorned and Cursed by His Son</p>
<p>Son Accused in Another Case</p>
<p>Court Discusses Father's Evil Deeds</p>
<p>Gu Chengyou, son of Gu Zhenxian, a comprador for the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co., has been deeply fearful that the country will be lost without end since the Japanese invaders occupied the Northeast and shelled Shanghai. He repeatedly advised his father not to cooperate with the Japanese anymore and to resign from his comprador position in time to avoid social scorn. However, Zhenxian stubbornly refused and remained loyal. His son then privately named him a traitorous merchant. Recently, he even sent a letter in the name of the Blood Soul Group, issuing a stern warning, hoping to make his father pull back from the brink. However, Zhenxian, being greedy for wealth and position, remained unmoved and even drove his son away. Chengyou was extremely angry, and his nerves were also disordered. On the 22nd, he suddenly went to Wing On Company on Nanjing Road South empty-handed and arbitrarily selected items worth 1,000 yuan. He asked the company to send someone to his home at 3 Xuanshou Lane, Jingxiu Road in the city, to collect the money. Upon arriving at the home, his stepmother refused to pay and ordered the deliveryman to go to Mitsui &amp; Co. on Sichuan Road to ask his father for payment. Zhenxian was out at the time, so the deliveryman took the goods back. The next morning, Chengyou called Wing On Company, saying that he had prepared the money and urged them to deliver the goods quickly. When the company sent someone to his home again, no one paid. Wing On Company believed that this behavior was deceptive and reported it to the Laozha Police Station. Detective Ye Yushi arrested Gu Chengyou and took him to the police station. Gu then poured out to the police chief all the facts about his father willingly flattering the Japanese and wanting to be a traitorous merchant. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Gu to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Liu interrogated him. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, accused the defendant of fraudulently obtaining property and requested punishment according to Article 363 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, the defendant stated that his mother had initially agreed to give him 700 yuan, so he went to buy things. The purchase only slightly exceeded the amount. He did not expect his mother to suddenly refuse to give him any money after the purchase. He also requested the court to give him fifteen minutes to fully describe the facts of his father being a traitorous merchant. The judge instructed him that matters unrelated to the case would not be tolerated. He then pronounced the verdict: Gu Chengyou was sentenced to three months imprisonment for the crime of attempted fraudulent acquisition of property. After hearing the verdict, Gu still muttered to himself, saying that if he had been allowed to state the facts briefly, he would have been willing to accept the punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Account of the Qitai Steamer's Ordeal <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Goods from Shashi Cease Transportation</p>
<p>Shashi is an important port in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. A large amount of miscellaneous grains are shipped out every year. Various steamer companies in Shanghai have all dispatched steamers to travel there. However, recently, due to the suppression of communists, panic has arisen. Goods from Shanghai to Shashi have completely stopped loading, and the Jiejiang's Qitai steamer even encountered a shock in Shashi. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Qitai Encountered Bandits</p>
<p>The Jiejiang's Qitai steamer, traveling from Shanghai to Yichang, encountered the Red Army under He Long's command about thirty miles downstream from Shashi on the 16th of this month. The bandits opened fire on the steamer, intending to rob it. A team of American soldiers stationed on the Qitai steamer immediately returned fire with machine guns. However, the Red Army was numerous, and the Qitai was in great danger. Fortunately, the Jincheng warship dispatched by the Sichuan Army arrived and drove the communists back, allowing the Qitai to escape danger and sail upstream.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding During Steamer Inspection</p>
<p>Shashi is currently garrisoned by Wang Fangzhou's troops. Regiment Commander Yang Hui is responsible for Shashi's security. When the Qitai steamer arrived at the mouth of Shashi, the garrison ordered it to stop for inspection to prevent communists from infiltrating. The shipowner, Tyler, said that the water was too rapid to dock and requested inspection at the pier. The garrison did not understand him and saw that the Qitai did not stop. They thought it was resisting orders and fired warning shots. The American soldiers inside the ship mistakenly thought it was a second attempt by the Red Army to rob the ship and used machine guns to fire at the garrison on the shore, resulting in a big misunderstanding. Later, a large team of garrison troops arrived and detained the Qitai.</p>
<p>Arrest of the Captain</p>
<p>The Shashi garrison troops boarded the Qitai steamer and arrested Captain Tyler and the ship's comprador to investigate who had opened fire. They demanded that the person be handed over, saying that four garrison soldiers had been injured by bullets. The American soldiers on the ship, knowing that they had caused the trouble due to a misunderstanding, hid in the cabin. The shipowner was brought to the headquarters and saw Regiment Commander Yang. The Chinese comprador explained that it was a misunderstanding and not a deliberate act of resisting the military inspection. The escorting American soldiers had encountered communists midway and acted in self-defense. He described the process of escaping the bandits. Regiment Commander Yang released Tyler after repeated proof from the crew.</p>
<p>Merchandise Shipped Out of Shashi</p>
<p>Due to the serious suppression of bandits, merchants in the city hired steamers to ship out all their stored merchandise to Hankou for storage. Banks also entrusted their stored cash to Jardine Matheson's Baohuo steamer for temporary storage in Hankou. Boxes and items from various merchants are also being loaded onto a hired steamer. If necessary, they can be shipped downstream. A prepared merchant steamer is also anchored in front of the Shashi Customs.</p>
<p>Suspension of Merchandise Business</p>
<p>Since the 15th and 16th of this month, Shashi merchants have completely stopped doing business. There are telegrams asking that the goods purchased in Shanghai not be shipped for the time being. The export of goods from Shanghai to Shashi has also stopped. As for the goods stored in the Shashi warehouses, they are being rushed to be shipped to various ports. They must be shipped out in a short period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Robbers Who Are Also Kidnappers <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Letters Demanding Ransom Arrive One After Another</p>
<p>Second-Hand Goods Vendor Apprehended by Guards</p>
<p>Qiao Guanxiang, a carpenter residing west of the Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai's western suburbs, near the Datie Bridge, has gradually become well-off through diligence and thrift. His wife, Jiang, has given birth to three sons: Shunyu, 16, Xiaoshun, 10, and a baby brother only a few months old. Recently, they were targeted by bandits. On the morning of the 11th of this month, at around 2 AM, eight bandits speaking a mixed dialect and wearing white short shirts and pants broke into the house. Four of them had pistols. They ransacked the chests and boxes and threatened and extorted silver dollars from Qiao Guanxiang, but failed. He was then hit on the left hand with an iron bar. His mother, Yao, and wife, Jiang, were also seriously injured by the bandits kicking them. A neighbor, Gu Yunting, went out to call for help and was shot by the bandits, with bullets piercing both legs. He is still being treated at the Red Cross Hospital on Route Haig and has not recovered. Seeing that there were no valuables, the bandits kidnapped Qiao's second son, Xiaoshun, and fled east. Afterward, the victim reported the incident to the Xu Jing Public Security Branch of Qingpu County and the Second Water Police Team, requesting a thorough investigation. However, the victim received two letters from the post office the day before yesterday. The first letter said, "Your son is currently being cared for and treated very well. There is no need to worry." The second letter demanded a ransom of 200 yuan, specifying that the victim should come to negotiate at the west of the railway on Hongqiao Road in the western suburbs of Shanghai between 2 PM and 4 PM on the 23rd of the lunar calendar (yesterday). The person coming would be identified by carrying a Great Britain brand listening device wrapped in red cloth and an umbrella. If there was no sincerity in negotiating, drastic measures would be taken. After receiving the letter, Qiao reported to the Public Security Branch and the Water Police Team. Inspector Luo Desheng and detectives Yao Youlian and others were dispatched in disguise. The Sixth District, First Branch, Hongqiao Road Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was also notified to assist. Until 5 PM, Song Wanjun and Ma Shifu, two Jiangbei Rugao natives selling second-hand goods, were seen wandering around at the intersection of Yangzhai Road and Hongqiao Road, repeatedly observing the victim. The detectives, seeing their suspicious behavior, stepped forward to arrest them and brought them, along with the second-hand goods pole, to the Sixth District, First Branch. After the station chief, Bi Zhenhua, presented the case for strict interrogation, Song and Ma vehemently denied the robbery, looting of money, kidnapping, and demanding ransom. Station chief Bi, believing the case to be serious, ordered them to be temporarily detained pending further investigation.</p>

In addition to arresting the shop owner, Qiu Yonghua, at the shop around 10 AM, several Chinese and foreign associates were also arrested and handed over to the police station. After Jianghai Customs and the concession authorities inspected the shop's books, they discovered that many goods had been smuggled in to evade taxes. The value of the diamonds, jewelry, and ornaments reached hundreds of thousands. Jianghai Customs requested the Special District Court to order the police station to allow all assets in the shop to be moved to Jianghai Customs for further handling.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Further News on the Collision of Two British Steamers <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Both Steamers Seriously Damaged</p>
<p>Losses Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson North China liner Lishun collided with the Blue Funnel Line (Calchas) Koureksis at 1:15 PM the day before yesterday near Qichang Wharf while leaving port. The two steamers were damaged. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Details of the Incident</p>
<p>The Blue Funnel Line foreign steamer Koureksis, loaded with a large batch of gasoline and steel from London, as well as 1,700 tons of goods bound for Japan, arrived in Shanghai on the 19th and docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. After unloading the goods, it planned to leave for Japan at around 1 PM yesterday. While turning around to leave port and approaching the Qichang Wharf, it had just used a tugboat to pull the bow outward when the Jardine Matheson's Lishun steamer, also leaving port, approached from behind. Due to the rapid water and strong winds, it also hired a Hutchison tugboat to tow it. Although the Koureksis had turned around properly, the tide was rising and the water was rapid. The steamer was pushed backward by the tide. The Lishun steamer saw the steamer reversing and, although it reversed its engines, it was too close to avoid a collision.</p>
<p>Both Steamers Damaged</p>
<p>The rapid current and strong winds pushed the Koureksis backward, and the Lishun steamer could not avoid it. The bow of the Lishun struck the stern of the Koureksis. Because the Koureksis was large and high, the Lishun was small, so it struck below the stern deck of the Koureksis, directly at the propeller and rudder. Although the Lishun was damaged at the time, it was below the waterline. Only the copper railings on the bow were damaged, and the damage below was not noticed. It was still towed outward by the tugboat. Later, the tugboat gradually became overloaded and unable to tow. The small boat noticed that the bow of the Lishun was gradually sinking and notified the Lishun steamer. The shipowner, upon receiving the report, ordered someone to inspect the forepeak, which was already flooded. They used pumps to pump the water, but it was ineffective. They quickly sailed to a shallow beach and grounded the ship on the Lancun Beach in Yangshupu. They only knew that a hole had been punctured. At that time, the water was high and the wind was strong, so they first secured the steamer. They later learned that the starboard side had been severely damaged and reported it to the company. They also reported it to the Marine Department of the Customs. After the Koureksis collided with the Lishun, it also felt that the propeller was not working properly. It was later discovered that a propeller blade was damaged, so it stopped leaving port and was repaired in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Passengers and Cargo Transferred</p>
<p>The Lishun steamer was traveling from Shanghai to Weihai, Yantai, Tianjin, etc. It was loaded with more than 16,000 bags of flour, 600 bags of rice, more than 2,000 pieces of paper, more than 200 boxes of tea, and more than 800 pieces of miscellaneous goods, totaling about 1,500 tons. There were seven Western passengers and more than forty Chinese passengers. After the incident, they all disembarked. The cargo in the cabin, especially the forepeak, was already flooded. Today, barges were hired to completely transfer the cargo. It was also seen that there was a large hole in the starboard side of the forepeak, with a propeller blade still embedded in the iron plate. According to the company, after the cargo is transferred, it will be repaired at the Ruirong Shipyard today. The loss for repairs is estimated at more than 20,000 yuan. The loss of cargo will be investigated later.</p>
<p>Responsibility Assessment</p>
<p>After the incident, the Rivers and Harbors Department of the Customs received the report and sent personnel to the scene to investigate and inquire about the circumstances of the incident from the two shipowners for reference. As for the issue of responsibility, because both steamers were British-owned, it will be judged by the British Consulate General in Shanghai in the future. The two companies were very busy handling the ship repairs, so negotiations had not yet begun yesterday.</p>

<p>Visits Shanghai's National Goods Factories Yesterday</p>
<p>Promotes National Goods Association to Hold Public Banquet on Schedule</p>
<p>The Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Batavia, Java, believes that the motherland's national goods are increasing and becoming more prosperous, striving to awaken overseas Chinese to purchase and use them and develop the economy. Since the January 28th Incident, national goods factories have been greatly affected. To understand the actual situation, they specially sent Zheng Bulun, a wealthy businessman traveling to Java who is enthusiastic about national goods, back to the country for investigation, and sent letters to various public groups in Shanghai in advance to facilitate the work. It is learned that Mr. Zheng has arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is staying at Yipinxian. The Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association believes that Mr. Zheng is concerned about national goods and has the responsibility to assist in the work. It has appointed Chen Yiting, Chen Binghui, Fang Jiange, and Xu Jianruo, four standing committee members, to receive him and guide him to visit the factories of its members that are suitable for selling Java goods to introduce purchases. National goods factories that intend to expand Java trade can contact the association or directly contact Mr. Zheng. It is also heard that the association plans to convene related factories to hold a welcome public banquet to fulfill the friendship of the host.</p>

<p>Reports on the Dutch Government's Exclusion of Apollo</p>
<p>The National Goods Promotion Grand Alliance Committee held a reception at the Central Restaurant yesterday at 7 p.m., inviting representatives from various public organizations and leaders from all sectors to report on the Dutch Philips' exclusion of Apollo national goods light bulbs in South Asian business and to discuss countermeasures and assistance methods. More than 120 people attended. Chairman Chen Yiting first gave a report, briefly stating that China has been in civil war for many years, and industry and commerce have declined. Foreigners are taking the opportunity to carry out economic aggression. The comparison between the slight presence of our national goods abroad and the sales of foreign goods in China is less than one in ten thousand, which has aroused jealousy and designs to defeat them among foreigners. Apollo's being invaded by Philips is just the beginning. If we do not resist, the promotion of counterfeit national goods overseas will follow one after another, which is of great importance to the entire overseas trade of national goods. Our association has an unshirkable responsibility to protect national goods factories, but it has weak capabilities and is insufficient to achieve results. Therefore, following the resolutions of the National Goods Four Organizations Factory Representative Conference,</p>
<p>We invite leaders from all public organizations and circles in Shanghai and the press to concentrate their strength and give practical assistance. This is a fortune for national goods, as well as for the national economy and people's livelihood. Next, Apollo representative Hu Xiyuan reported on the situation of being invaded. Chairman Wang Xingyi reported on the resolutions of the Representative Conference: (1) Telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously negotiate and review Philips' patent for glass tube evacuation method; (2) All national goods factories in Shanghai should automatically stop using all Philips products and send letters and telegrams to the electrical industry to pay attention; (3) Invite all public organizations in Shanghai to request assistance. Next, Yuan Yongting, Wang Yansong, Pan Gongzhan, Lu Wenshao, Zhao Xiuqing, Li Henglin, Wang Xiaochun, Chu Huiseng, and others successively expressed their opinions, unanimously expressing active assistance. The event ended happily at about 10 p.m.</p>

<p>Current Situation of Hunger-Striking Workers A total of 31 hunger-striking workers, except for Hong Jiaben and others who were sent to the hospital earlier due to severe illness, were forcibly sent to the Labor Hospital and Shanghai Hospital by personnel from the Party and government organs the day before yesterday to prevent their lives from being endangered. A reporter from the Ta Kung Pao specially went to the Labor Hospital yesterday to inquire about the current situation of the workers. According to the nurses in the hospital, after the workers were admitted to the hospital, the doctors examined them separately and recorded their pulse and temperature. They were advised to eat, but the workers still refused to accept. The doctors then gave them medicine, and they were generally fine. However, some people had more serious illnesses, and their symptoms were as follows: Hong Jiaben and Lu Shiying had severe headaches; Hou Zhangyuan and Liu Yuanxing had numbness in their hands and feet; Sun Yucheng had abdominal pain and vomiting; Zhang Zegang had chest pain and nosebleeds.</p>
<p>Families Came to Shanghai to Visit After hearing the news of the hunger strike, the family of hunger-striking worker Sun Handong rushed to Shanghai from their hometown yesterday. They went to the Labor Hospital to visit him. When they saw his pale and thin face and weak spirit, they could not help but burst into tears. Fortunately, Wang Xianqing, a representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the doctors repeatedly comforted them, and they hired a car to send him to his relatives behind the Great World for temporary accommodation. The family of Zhu Jinsheng also came to Shanghai from their hometown yesterday and went to the Shanghai Hospital to visit his condition, which was very miserable.</p>
<p>Ninth Period of Food Not Received The workers' temporary food maintenance fee is 120 yuan per day, which was originally scheduled to be collected every Wednesday. Except for the previous period's food expenses, which had already been received the day before (Monday), yesterday was the date to receive the ninth period's food expenses. The union representatives Xia Zhongzhao and Qin Haiyan, together with Zhu Guilin, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the head office on Nanjing Road yesterday morning to collect the money. They met with Wang Xianhua, a director of the company, who said that the company had decided not to issue the food expenses anymore, so he could not issue them without authorization. He had to ask the board of directors, and it might be issued on Friday (tomorrow). The representatives then left. Refutation of the Board of Directors' Announcement The Wang Association of the Cotton Weaving Industry in the Seventh District believed that the announcement published by the factory's board of directors in various newspapers was inconsistent with the facts. Yesterday, they specially wrote a refutation as follows: Regarding the announcement of the board of directors of Sanyou Industrial Company, we are unwilling to make any more meaningless disputes. Now, we are afraid that people in society will be deceived, so we solemnly declare again to clarify the truth. (1) When the January 28th Shanghai Incident suddenly occurred, the situation was tense, and the capitalists notified the suspension of work the next day to avoid the danger at that time. At that time, the workers' savings were not settled and paid. After the ceasefire agreement was signed, the workers came to collect them one after another. Because the Japanese army had not yet withdrawn from the factory, they repeatedly requested that relief be given before work resumed. The capitalists refused, and the workers had no choice but to pay all the savings successively. However, as of recently, it is feared that there are still a few workers who have not received them. (2) On May 31st, the Japanese army left the factory, and the union first sent a letter to the police of the Fourth Police Station in the Fifth District to protect the factory. On June 2nd, they entered the factory and stayed there, entering from the side door on the west side. At that time, Shen Xiangji had carpenters working there, repairing the factory, not breaking in through the screen. (3) The company has had huge profits over the years. After the ceasefire agreement was signed and the Japanese army had just withdrawn, the company sent people to transport the machines in the factory to the Hangzhou branch, intending to stop the main factory and expand the Hangzhou factory. In short, the capitalists are fabricating facts everywhere to destroy the old workers. Therefore, contradictory words have emerged one after another. Now that the government is arbitrating according to law, it will not be difficult to get to the bottom of the matter. In the future, we will ignore the company's meaningless disputes. (4) Furthermore, the company started with a capital of 500 yuan and has achieved today's results. The profits over the years are in the tens of thousands. Even in the past year, the company's account report showed a profit of more than 320,000 yuan. As for the number of debts, it has not exceeded the number of previous years. The reason for the delay in resuming work is that they deliberately make things difficult. Looking at the recent sudden fire in the factory, the electrical outage, and the closing of the water supply (according to the Bureau of Public Works' statement yesterday, the coppersmith falsely claimed to be acting on the order of the fire brigade, and the Bureau of Public Works has denied this, so who is the instigator? It should not be difficult to find out), we can see a glimpse of the capitalists' intentions. In short, all the workers of our Sanyou Factory are crying out and appealing for a living, and in order to maintain national goods, they are unwilling to implement a violent destruction policy, and they are resorting to passive hunger strikes. The purity of their actions and the sadness of their hearts can be understood by the people of society. If the factory still has a sense of benevolence, for the sake of the suffering of our workers and for the future of the national industry, it should quickly plan to resume work. Then all our workers will naturally, based on the spirit of labor-capital cooperation in the past, voluntarily reduce wages and step up production to assist the development of the national goods industry.</p>
<p>The Union's Comfort The Aid Committee of the General Labor Union for the Hunger-Striking Workers of Sanyou Factory specially sent two members, Ye Xianggao and Shao Xubai, to the hospital yesterday to comfort the hunger-striking workers and told them that the municipal government had submitted the dispute to arbitration and that there would be a considerable solution soon. Please ask the workers to eat first to avoid accidents. The hunger-striking workers listened and nodded to express their gratitude, but they still refused to resume eating.</p>

They are all products with loud volume and beautiful timbre, and their strange shapes are rarely seen in modern society. The range of sound is large, from the lowest to the highest, with a total of eight levels. They were completely completed yesterday and handed over to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which distributed them to the group for distribution and practice. Everyone was overjoyed and indescribable. There are currently about 70 people taking classes on a regular basis, and it is said that there are still a large number of people who continue to join the group. The quota is 100 people, and they are working hard to practice. They plan to perform an outdoor trip on the Double Ten Festival this year as a large-scale promotion.</p>

According to Japanese reports, the corpses were rotten, causing a foul odor that was unbearable to see, which proves that the local people do not have a proper understanding of the defense authorities.

<p>One-Third of Membership Fees Donated to the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The Chinese Harmonica Association aims to study harmonica music, promote noble art, and promote national spirit. Since September 18th last year, although the association has been affected by the current situation, it has still actively carried out various national salvation works. Last year, at the association's first anniversary music conference, it played "Black Horse Galloping" and other pieces to donate to General Ma and various provinces for disaster relief. During the Shanghai War, the association specially compiled "Song of the 19th Route Army" and organized a harmonica team to go to various wounded soldiers' hospitals and the front lines of Su Kun and other places to perform and comfort our loyal and brave soldiers who defended the country. The association also added a "National Crisis Harmonica Class" to teach patriotic and heroic songs to encourage the morale of compatriots and jointly face the national crisis. The results were excellent and were highly praised by the general public. Recently, Chairman Wang of the association, in view of the brave and good fighting of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army for the country, specially compiled "Rising Up to Save the Country" and "March of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army" and other songs to commemorate them. The association continued to set up a "National Crisis Class" at the association's office at 168 Sichuan Road. The time has been set. The evening class is from 7:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. every Saturday night, and the day class is from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. every Saturday afternoon. The course will be completed in two months. The membership fee is 3 yuan per month per person, of which 1 yuan will be donated to the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. Mr. Lin Kanghou, a member of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association, has been invited to supervise the class. Both classes are personally instructed by Chairman Wang. Those who are patriotic and want to study noble harmonica music, regardless of gender or qualifications, please register with the association as soon as possible. The class will start on September 3rd. A booklet is available for filing. In addition, the association's harmonica team is now planning to recruit dozens of new members for expansion. Regardless of whether they are members of the association, those who have a considerable level of proficiency will be added to the research immediately after passing the guidance and review.</p>

<p>Fan Hongsheng Sentenced to Fifteen Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Fan Hongsheng from Nanjing, also known as Fan Ruibao, had a love affair with female physiognomist Wang Wenying. Because he could not achieve the purpose of marriage, he suspected that Wang's mother, Wu, was obstructing him. He developed evil thoughts and went to Wenying's home at 89 Pingle Lane, Xizang Road at 2 p.m. on July 19th this year with a knife, intending to kill Wang Wu. However, because Wu dodged, he did not hit the vital point and only caused minor injuries. At that time, Wenying saw the situation and shouted loudly. Fan was afraid of being arrested, so he stabbed Wenying several times, all of which hit the vital points, and she died immediately. Fan fled without a trace at that time. He was later arrested by the West Detective of the Lao Zha Police Station at his sister's home on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei. The police station's lawyer, Ru Bao, filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court on the charge of premeditated murder. Fan also hired lawyer Jiang Baoli to defend him, saying that Fan suffered from mental loss and should be exempted from his sentence according to law and requested that he be declared innocent. The Special Court had repeatedly summoned and interrogated the parties,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Feng Shide, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, opened the first criminal court and announced the verdict. The main text of the verdict was that Fan Hongsheng was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment for the crime of murder and 7 years of imprisonment for the crime of attempted premeditated murder, totaling 15 years of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be two days for one day of imprisonment. The incidental civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court for trial. Fan's ex-wife (divorced), Yang Xiuying, lived at 2 Shenjia Lane, Sanpailou Road in the city after separating from Fan and worked as a female host at No. 7 at Tianyunlou Amusement Park to make a living.</p>

<p>Stealing 2,000 Yuan Worth of Clothing</p>
<p>The Cantonese woman Zhong Wang, who lived at 1099 North Sichuan Road, went to live with relatives on the day after the January 28th incident and asked the maid Qin Yu, a native of Jiangbei, to take care of the house. Unexpectedly, Qin conspired with Zhuang Shilin, a native of Pudong, his wife Wan, and Zhu Dasheng, a native of Yangzhou, to steal all the clothing worth 2,000 yuan and flee without a trace. After Zhong Wang returned home, she reported the theft to the Hongkou Police Station. It was not until the day before yesterday that Detective Sun Aizhong arrested the four suspects and recovered some of the stolen clothes, gold watches, and gold rings. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the first court. Detective Sun Hua reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants, and the stolen goods were presented for inspection. The plaintiff, Zhong Wang, stated that she had entrusted the defendant Qin Yu to take care of the house at the time. She did not expect Qin to betray her trust and conspire with the other defendants to move everything out of the house. She had been working for her family for eight years. The items presented in the case were all stolen goods. When questioned, the defendants' confessions were evasive. Judge Shen Bingrong declared to Qin Yu that the mistress trusted her very much because she had been working for her for many years and entrusted her with valuable property. She should not have breached her trust. Qin bowed her head and begged for forgiveness. She was then ordered to be detained separately and the case was scheduled for re-examination.</p>

<p>Ren Jiaping Claims</p>
<p>Ren Jiaping, an old man from Suzhou, dressed like a beggar, went to the District Court yesterday to accuse his son, Ren Lianfang, who currently lives on Guoqing Road, Zhabei. He used to run Anle Company (i.e., gambling dens for foreigners) and accumulated more than 100,000 yuan in assets. The house he currently lives in is a three-story building, and the furnishings in the room are luxurious, comparable to the house of a gentry. However, the old man eats a free meal at his son's house, eating at the same table as the servants and sleeping next to the gatehouse. He is poorly clothed. The son treats his father like a lowly person, and his 14-year-old grandson has also inherited his father's legacy, treating his poor grandfather like cattle and horses. The day before yesterday, the grandson deliberately beat his grandfather. When he was reprimanded, the son heard about it and beat the old man and drove him out of the house, causing him to sleep in the alley in the wind and rain, among the beggars. Such a heartless person despises his poor grandfather. There is no other way. He requests that the injuries be examined and the case be investigated. The prosecutor examined the injuries and ordered the case to be investigated.</p>

The order was in great chaos. Fortunately, the Zhabei fire brigades drove to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire. It took 40 minutes to extinguish the fire. As a result, two bungalows were burned down.</p>

<p>Li A'mei, a woman from Jingjiang, who lives at 111 Xinjiekou, Caojiadu, Huxi, is 16 years old and has a good appearance. She is coveted by Jiang Longbao, who lives nearby, and often approaches her with seductive words. A'mei ignored him. On the night of the 22nd of this month, Jiang saw that Li A'mei's sister had gone to work in the factory, and only A'mei was at home. He covered people's house, when A'mei was still in a sweet dream, she was raped. She woke up, unable to move, and he left after finishing the act. Unexpectedly, Jiang was extremely lustful and went again the next day and raped her again using the same trick. Li A'mei grabbed him and shouted loudly, and the neighbors arrested Jiang and called the police. He was taken to the Sixth District and sent to the District Court for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<p>At 7:40 p.m. last night, a Route 10 public bus drove from north to south in front of Lida Coal Shop on Zhong Hongqiao, Hongkou. A person riding a bicycle, carrying a pillow in his hand, was coming head-on. He was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground by the public bus, crushing his vital parts and killing him. After a street patrolman found him, he copied down the driver's name and the vehicle number and immediately carried the body to Tongren Hospital, transferring him to the autopsy room to wait for the autopsy. The deceased was about 24 or 25 years old, wearing a white gauze shirt and silk trousers.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Bad Luck for Good Fortune Bookstore <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Selling Obscene Books</p>
<p>Fine of 300 Yuan</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters found that the novels "Little White Face", "The Great View of Maritime Mysteries", "New Tide of the Sea of Desire", "Unofficial History of the Meat Forest", "New Tide of Clouds and Rain", "Lu Gaojian", "Spring Colors of the East Neighbor", and "The Flowery Hell" published by the Good Fortune Bookstore at 103 Jiaotong Road, International Settlement, all contained obscene language. There was also a book titled "White River Military Parade Photography," which involved reactionary and pro-Japanese propaganda. The committee sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation. Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau forwarded the letter to the Police Department of the Bureau of Public Works and requested the First Special Court to issue a search warrant. The warrant was issued to Chief Patrolman Pang Jinshan and Public Security Bureau investigators, who went to search the bookstore the day before yesterday. Except for the book "White River Military Parade," which was not found, they seized 482 copies of the remaining books and took the manager, Lu Jiying, a native of Guangdong, back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the previous situation and stated that the defendant had not submitted the above books to the Ministry of Interior or the Municipal Party Headquarters for registration. Therefore, he is now prosecuting according to Article 251 of the Criminal Law. Furthermore, the defendant violated the provisions of Article 19 of the Publication Law, so he requested that a heavier punishment be imposed according to Article 35 of the Publication Law. Chief Patrolman Pang then submitted a report on the circumstances of the search and interrogated the defendant. Lawyer Wang Peiyuan defended, saying that although the names of the seized books were close to obscene, the content was completely the opposite. The sole purpose was to expose the dark side of society and persuade others to avoid evil paths. He asked the court to read the preface to understand. Therefore, the defendant did not commit any crime and requested that he be declared innocent. After Judge Liu Yugui verified the confession, he sentenced Lu Jiying to a fine of 300 yuan and confiscated the seized books.</p>

<p>Truly a Grave Sin</p>
<p>The monks of Zhu Tianjun Temple, next door to Dexingfang, Gansu Road, west of Qipu Road, are mostly addicted to opium. Yesterday, someone surnamed Mou pretended to hold a funeral for his ancestors at the temple and invited the monks to chant scriptures and perform rituals. At about 10 a.m., after the monks finished their work, their opium addiction flared up. They hurriedly took off their cassocks, went upstairs one after another, and lay on the beds, indulging in opium. Suddenly, several Chinese and Western detectives arrived upstairs and arrested the five blacklisted monks, seizing some opium and opium paraphernalia in the room. They were taken to the police station to await trial in court. It is said that the abbot was also among the arrested monks. As for the family holding the funeral, because the monks chanting scriptures and performing rituals were arrested, the rituals were in danger of being suspended. They negotiated with the receptionist monk of the temple, and the monk agreed to find other monks to continue the work, and the dispute was resolved immediately. The sound of cymbals and Buddhist chants was resumed.</p>

<p>Recently, the Anhui Provincial Association, due to the news that Ye, the acting Finance Director of Anhui Province, came to Shanghai to privately borrow funds from banks and money houses, held a meeting a few days ago and decided to send a telegram to inquire about the truth and express their opposition. The telegram reads: "Respectfully to Chairman Wu of the Anhui Provincial Government. News reports that Acting Finance Director Ye of Anhui Province has come to Shanghai and is engaging in large-scale borrowing without public announcement, causing public anxiety. It is noted that previous governments of this province have never had foreign debt burdens and were able to economize and care for the people even during the floods of last year. When you first took office, you stated that the primary task was to reorganize the economy. If revenue can be increased and corruption eliminated, financial difficulties can easily be resolved. However, it has not been long before there are talks of large-scale borrowing, and even rumors of private actions. We do not know on what basis this is being done, nor what the funds will be used for. As fellow villagers, we cannot bear to remain silent about matters of common interest. We held a meeting on the [unclear date] of this month and decided to send a telegram to your government, urging you not to set this bad precedent to prevent future troubles, and requesting you to announce the truth to reassure the public. Sincerely, the Anhui Association in Shanghai. [Signature]."</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, the China National Goods Maintenance Association, and two other groups have sent a letter to the Guangdong Public National Salvation Association, stating: "Regarding the case of the Jiuji Cotton Mill's products, managed by the Yongyuan Trading Company, being transported to Guangdong and mistakenly detained by the Guangzhou Anti-Japanese Association as Japanese goods, our associations have previously jointly sent a letter proving that they are national goods and requesting their return. Now, your association has sent representatives Bao Tianfang and Ma Huayi to Shanghai to investigate, and the results obtained are no different from what our associations stated in our previous letter. Since these goods have been detained, the Yongyuan Trading Company has suffered significant intangible losses. Now that the investigation has confirmed the facts, the goods should be returned as soon as possible to avoid further delays. We hereby request your association to consider the difficulties of businesses and resolve this case as soon as possible to protect national goods. This is our sincere hope. Addressed to the Guangdong Public National Salvation Congress."</p>
<h3 id="e161">International Trade Bureau Compiles Trade Statistics <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in order to facilitate the study of international trade, has specially compiled three types of monthly international trade statistics through its Statistics Department: 1. Monthly statistics on total import and export trade; 2. Monthly statistics on the classification of import and export commodities; and 3. Statistics on the countries of import and export trade. The second type of statistics is based on the customs' monthly statistical reports, which have been reclassified and compiled. The special feature is that import and export commodities are divided into four major categories and one hundred and twenty-four minor categories, so that readers can observe the trends of trade and at the same time speculate on the prosperity or decline of our country's industries. For the convenience of historical research, the classification method is still based on the "China International Trade Statistics for Sixty-Five Years" compiled by Yang of the Academia Sinica, which scientifically divides them into four major categories: food and tobacco, raw materials, semi-finished products, manufactured goods, and miscellaneous items. Yang's compilation covers the period up to 1928. In 1929, Hou Houpei and Lou Yun compiled for one year. Now the bureau has compiled from 1930 onwards, so that the seventy years can be continuously referenced. These three types of statistics are printed separately each month and published regularly. The June issue of this year has already been published. If people from all walks of life need to refer to them, please write directly to the International Trade Bureau on Hankou Road to request them.</p>

<p>Since the invasion by the brutal Japanese, the entire country has been urgently promoting national goods. However, copper polish is widely used, and most of what is sold on the market is imported. Domestically produced products are often shoddy, causing the reputation of domestic products to plummet. Now, Mr. Zhang and others, based on their experience, have organized a Huaguang Chemical Company, and the White Dog Brand Copper Polish is particularly well-made, able to compete with foreign goods. Moreover, the price is very low. The distribution office is located at 169 Nanjing Road. Major companies and hardware stores in the local area and other places serve as agents.</p>

<p>Dr. Sun Kejin of Germany</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Kejin, a reputable doctor from Zhejiang, has served as a medical officer for the Songhu Headquarters, the Police Department, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Opium Prohibition Bureau, as well as a consultant to the Health Bureau.

He is proficient in internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, and resuscitation. Well-known figures from China and abroad admire his reputation. Among Chinese doctors, only a few, such as Mr. Sun, are trusted by Western merchants. During the September 18th Incident, he also served as the chief physician of the National Disaster Warriors Rescue Association and the Shanghai Local Maintenance Association's wounded soldiers hospital, curing illnesses with his medicine. Du Yuesheng presented him with a silver cup. Recently, the Sanmen Bay Brick Company hired him as a physician for the inspection team. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and is still practicing in his original location. He has now been appointed as a medical officer of the Security Department by Mayor Wu and will report for duty immediately. With his knowledge and experience in health and disease treatment, the staff and soldiers will surely benefit from his expertise.</p>

<p>Yang Zhaoqing, a Chinese detective of the Hongkou Police Station, arrested six male and female human traffickers, including Wang Xi, a Fujianese, at the Xinfa Hotel at 62 Wuhu Road on June 14th. A total of eleven children were recovered. The criminals were handed over by the police station to the First Special District Court, where they were interrogated and sentenced to imprisonment. Among the children, Li Amao from Henan was ill and was treated at Guangren Hospital. He only fully recovered yesterday. Because the police station was unable to find Li's family and was about to send the child to the Fourth Criminal Court for disposition, the police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, presented the previous circumstances and requested instructions. Li Amao was wearing a white foreign cloth shirt with red flowers, white cloth pants with blue stripes, had a shaved head, was barefoot, had a long, yellow, and thin face, and could only say his age, name, and place of origin. He knew nothing else. Judge Fu Lin ordered that Li Amao be sent to the Women's Relief Society for temporary care.</p>

<p>Weiya Restaurant was originally established on Chongming Road more than ten years ago and is a pioneer of Cantonese restaurants in Shanghai. The excellence of its dishes and the low prices have long been well-known. Later, due to the renovation of the building and the outbreak of the February 28th Incident, it was closed for half a year. Now, in response to the needs of all circles, the restaurant has chosen to open tomorrow at 801 North Sichuan Road, the northern end of West Wuchang Road in Hongkou. The location is suitable, the layout is magnificent, the halls and rooms are elegant and clean, the seats are comfortable, and the service is attentive. The dishes are novel and truly authentic Cantonese flavors, with everything available. It can be guaranteed that there will be no leftover dishes. All kinds of celebrations, banquets, and small gatherings are fully prepared. At the beginning of the new opening, prices are specially discounted to meet the elegant tastes of all circles.</p>

<p>Xu Shiting, a native of Ningbo with the address of 610 Zhoushan Road, was arrested by the Shangbao Special Zone Saltpeter Branch together with the Huishan Police for smuggling saltpeter. He was then transferred to the First Special District Court, where the police charged him with Article 201 of the Criminal Law. During yesterday's retrial, the defendant confessed that the saltpeter was for making firecrackers. However, the passport he presented was not in the defendant's name and had expired, making it equivalent to waste paper. This clearly violated the criminal law. Judge Shen sentenced him to two months' imprisonment according to law, and the saltpeter was confiscated. The defendant's lawyer requested bail in court, but the court refused.</p>

<p>Regarding the news item published in your newspaper's news column on the 15th of this month ("Kim Koo Has Been Arrested"), we were shocked to read it. The Korean Kim Koo has not been hiding in Chongming, and the Japanese consulate has not notified the authorities to assist in arresting Kim Koo. Furthermore, no Japanese warship has arrived in Chongming and no marines have landed. The sections reported by your newspaper are not only completely fabricated but also have no impact at all. Since the invasion of Shanghai by the brutal Japanese, the party and government agencies and mass organizations in our county have all been deeply saddened. How could we disregard territorial sovereignty and assist the Japanese bandits? The report in your newspaper is probably a false rumor. However, since it concerns the reputation of the entire county, we are sending this letter to correct it in order to dispel public doubts, and we hope that it will be published. Addressed to the Chief Editor of the Shen Bao. From the Chongming County Public Security Bureau, August 22nd.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Starting from Hoover's Tears <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>1928. Mr. Hoover was elected President of the United States. He entered the palace to take office. Hundreds of thousands of people surrounded him and cheered. He came out to thank them, and then retired and wept. Alas, bearing the heavy trust of the entire country, if he did not strive with tears, how could he be diligent and govern well? These were indeed extraordinary tears, not to be expected from the authorities in China. Therefore, China ultimately remained ungoverned. How regrettable!</p>
<p>Japanese world-class athlete Oda Yokota was eliminated due to illness. Filled with anger, tears streamed down his face. Although it involved a petty family spirit, he was worthy of a hero. These were indeed extraordinary tears, not to be expected from the sports community in China. Therefore, China's sports ultimately remained stagnant. How regrettable!</p>
<p>In the 17th year of the Republic [1928], after the split between Nanjing and Wuhan, a certain central committee member said with emotion, "If the leaders of the party and the country do not gather together and embrace each other in tears, there will be no sincere unity." Alas, the words are still in our ears, and five years have passed. In these five years, the so-called leaders of the party and the country have shown nothing but tragedies of squabbling, resigning, declaring, and going abroad. As a result, the national situation is as precarious as it is today. I have not heard of any expression of weeping with shame, repentance, unity, or resistance to foreign aggression. Moreover, they deceive each other and are divided into four or five factions, still in a state of neither death nor life. It is said that only extraordinary people can shed extraordinary tears. This is indeed an extraordinary matter, not to be expected from the party and national leaders of today. Therefore, the foundation of the party is ultimately insecure, and the country is on the verge of destruction. How regrettable!</p>
<p>Shocking news of Rehe came. People ran and cried. A certain senior official cried while receiving reporters and said, "If I and my son do not love the country, how could things be as they are today?" His words were mournful and heartbreaking. However, if this burst of hot tears could be shed on the Nine-Eighteenth Incident [Mukden Incident] to destroy the home and dedicate oneself to fighting the enemy to the death, would it not shock the world and move the gods?</p>
<h3 id="e173">Distinguishing Traitors <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Hu Lifu is known as a [Han traitor]. He has now been taken to Beijing. Consider the word [jian]. Pronounced [gan]. As in the Tang Yun, Ji Yun, and Yun Hui, it is all [gu han qie], slightly different from [ju han qie]. It should not be read as [jian]. The Shuowen also says it means to violate. The Yu Pian says it means to cause chaos. The Zeng Yun only says it means something that is not in accordance with propriety. The Zuo Zhuan, 13th year of Duke Cheng, says [jian jue wo hao] [to break our good relations]. The Han Shu, Guliezhi, says [shi shen ren ge de qi suo, er bu xiang jian] [to enable gods and men to each get what they should, and not to interfere with each other]. The common saying [bu xiang gan] [not related] means this. However, the Ji Yun also reads it as [ju yan qie], pronounced [jian]. It means private, false, and also not read in the flat tone. The Zhuangzi, Tianyun, says [shang yi zhe qi shi er jun] [There were those who used this to overthrow seventy-two rulers]. The Shiji, History of Qi, says [shang yi yu diao jian Zhou] [They used fishing and angling to undermine Zhou]. It is used interchangeably with [gan], and is different from the current meaning of [Han traitor]. Therefore, is the word [jian] in [Han traitor] an error? Consider the fact that [jian] and [jian] have the same pronunciation. The Shuowen says it means private, one saying is fraud or licentiousness. The Book of Documents, Shun Dian, says [kou zei jian gui] [robbers, bandits, traitors, and secret agents]. The commentary says [to rob people is called kou, to kill people is called zei, those outside are called jian, those inside are called gui]. The Li Xue Li says [zheng yi yi qi xing, xing yi fang qi jian] [governance unifies their actions, punishment prevents their treacherous actions]. The Guanzi, Junchen Jie, says [zhi zha ju jian, hou guo zhi dao ye] [to stop fraud and restrain treacherous actions is the way to enrich the country]. [Jian] and [jian] seem the same but are actually different. Therefore, for the term [Han traitor], [jian] should be used, not [jian]. It is very clear. Ancient texts wrote it as [graph omitted], which is an ideogram. However, Korea, which continues to use Chinese books, uniquely uses [jian] for the word [jian] and [jian] for the word [jian], as seen in the Zheng Zi Tong. Thus, there is a different explanation that cannot be followed. Therefore, I write the Distinguishing Traitors.</p>
<p>Even if, unfortunately, it were to be defeated and destroyed, later generations would mourn his ambition and pity his fate. Although these tears have their master, they do not have their time. How regrettable!</p>
<h3 id="e174">Supplementary Record of the Little History of the Flying Eagle <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The Free Talk previously carried a section on the Little History of the Flying Eagle recorded by Jue Min. According to what I know, there are some discrepancies. I would like to correct them.</p>
<p>The Flying Eagle is the only remaining destroyer in our country, currently valued at more than 2 million yuan. Its sailing speed is known to be the highest among naval vessels, approximately 23 nautical miles per hour or more. As Jue Min said, the Empress Dowager Cixi of the late Qing Dynasty once sent it to pursue Kang Youwei, a leading figure in the Hundred Days' Reform, but without success. The ship's boiler was damaged due to overuse during this mission. In the sixth year of the Republic [1917], Chief of Staff Cheng Biguang led the southern expedition to protect the constitution against Yuan Shikai, stationed in the Pearl River, and it was completely abandoned. It was not until Di Jishen governed Guangdong, fearing the emptiness of coastal defense, that he spent 100,000 yuan to repair it. The repairs were for the entire boiler water pipes and some steel plates and machine parts at the bottom of the ship, not the boiler, and certainly not purchased and donated by Borodin. The successive captains from the twelfth to the seventeenth year of the Republic [1923-1928] were Huang Zhen from Jiangxi, followed by Shu Zongliu from Guangdong, who was the leader of the naval resistance against Chen Ce, who occupied the White Goose Pool and fought against the air force in the eighteenth year. Then came Chen Ding, and then Chen Jie, until the current battle when it sank, with Ren Yaokui, who was also the Deputy Adjutant of the Maritime Department. In the middle, there was no change of captain to a Russian, and it was never a stronghold for communist activities. This time, it sank off the coast of Hainan Island. Most newspapers believed it was caused by bombing. In fact, it was not. Although it had been hit by a bullet fired by Ding Jixu, a brave general in the civil war, it was damaged on the right side, destroying one cannon. It was not a critical hit. However, the crew feared death and sought to escape. Moreover, they followed the principle of Chen Qingyun, the commander of the Marine Corps, that it is better to sink the ship than to let it be used by the enemy, so defeat is still glorious. Alas, given the weakness of our country's existing navy and the fact that national power is not available for construction, there are people who do not cherish it at all and recklessly demonstrate their martial prowess, destroying national instruments in internecine strife. How regrettable!</p>

<p>[To bully good people is a real sin!] [If you want to bully, you should bully good people. If you bully bad people, you won't have peace!] [You have such a heart and say such words without even blushing. I really admire you!] [Heh! This is also learned from experience!]</p>
<p>[Look how grand his daughter's wedding is!] [You haven't seen him running around borrowing money a few days ago, with a pitiful expression.]</p>
<p>[Adding a mandarin jacket to a robe is really unreasonable for Chinese clothes.] [What's the reasoning behind the bow tie on your chest, or the buttons on your sleeves? What are they for?]</p>
<p>[Sir, please donate some money to the loyal and brave Northeastern Volunteer Army! They haven't had anything to eat for days!] [To be honest, I only have six yuan in my pocket today, and I have to go send a birthday gift to a friend!]</p>
<p>[Even a mosquito is a life. The sin of killing a mosquito is the same as the sin of killing a person.] [That's just talk. If you see a person and a mosquito falling into the river at the same time, which one would you save?] [I would save the mosquito.] [Why?] [Humans are better at doing evil than mosquitoes!] [Humans can kill mosquitoes, and mosquitoes can kill humans. How can you say that humans are more evil than mosquitoes?] [True, but there are only humans who kill each other, and no mosquitoes kill each other!]</p>

<h3 id="e177">The Secret History of the Twenty-One Demands (3) <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>On February 25th, I went to Beijing. I arrived on February 27th. On February 28th, I visited Minister Reinsch, but did not meet him. On March 1st, I had an important conversation with Reinsch. He told me that he had already forwarded our petition to the American government. He asked me to write to Stone, the director of the Associated Press of America, to visit Chinda, the Japanese ambassador to the United States, and to ask Wang Zhengting and Kong Xiangxi to persuade the Chinese people to remain calm. I also asked Reinsch to see Sir John Jordan, the British ambassador, and strongly pointed out the impropriety of Britain's protection of Japanese atrocities.</p>
<p>I learned from other sources that Hioki Eki intended to directly see Yuan Shikai with the Twenty-One Demands. He took out the articles and read them to Yuan one by one. President Yuan then asked him if he had already submitted these demands to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Hioki Eki replied that he had not gone to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and came directly to see the President. Yuan Shikai told him that China was a constitutional country, and these demands must be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, Hioki Eki turned a deaf ear, insisted on leaving the articles of demand on the table, and left. Yuan Shikai then summoned Sir John Jordan and Reinsch to study the matter.</p>
<p>Before the Twenty-One Demands were presented, Hioki Eki invited Moore, a reporter from the Associated Press of America, and J.O.P. Bland, a reporter from The Times of London, in advance. Hioki Eki said to them, "The Japanese government is holding a grand event at this time, and we invite you to go. All travel expenses will naturally be covered by the Japanese government. You can take this opportunity to go to Japan for sightseeing. You can gain a deeper understanding of Japan." Enticed by these sweet words, they accepted the invitation and went to Tokyo. Their duties in Beijing were taken over by their assistants.</p>
<p>As soon as these two important journalists left Beijing, Hioki Eki hurriedly presented the demands to Yuan Shikai. The next morning, the British embassy telephoned the Beijing reporters of The Times of London and the Associated Press of America, Moore and J.O.P. Bland, asking them to come. Unfortunately, they had already been tricked into going to Tokyo by Hioki Eki's ruse. The assistants of Moore and J.O.P. Bland went to the British embassy. The British embassy gave them each a copy of the Twenty-One Demands, instructing them to telegraph them to The Times of London and the Associated Press of America for publication. Stone, the director of the Associated Press of America, received the telegram of the Twenty-One Demands and found it very strange. He did not dare to publish it. Stone took the telegraphic manuscript to see Chinda, the Japanese ambassador to Washington, requesting confirmation. Chinda vehemently denied it. Later, the Japanese government also formally denied it. Stone then telegraphed Moore, severely reprimanding him for not distinguishing between truth and falsehood and sending a telegram of the Twenty-One Demands, which was enough to provoke war, and ordered an investigation into the source of the news. The Times of London also sent a similar telegram to J.O.P. Bland.</p>

<p>Creating a Hesitant Trend Yesterday's gold market was still calm, but it formed a swirling trend, unpredictable. The overall core was five taels. People's hearts were still good, and finally, it rose slightly by a few pennies. The silver market rose indeed and had no repercussions. The reason was that the European market tended to be flat, and the exchange rate rose slightly. Yesterday's price was too low, so there was a rebound. Later, the remittance rates of various banks were uncertain, resulting in a slight fluctuation of one or two taels in the price. As for foreign exchange, the lending rate was lengthened by half a grade, once breaking into 710 taels, showing a firm and beautiful image again. The short side slightly replenished, and the result was outside 712 taels. The September contract was transferred from the long side of Da Feng Heng, etc. to the short side of Heng Xing, with a discount of 1 tael and 3 mace, about 300 contracts.

<p>Five Happiness White Ice, recently, because the cost is high, the owner requires each anvil to stiffly pull 11 taels, but the current market is at most only 10 taels, so the difference is so much that it has not been opened for a long time. It was found that Taiyuan Bing used to be the same price, but the products have degenerated recently, and the current market is only 9 taels and 6 qian, not to mention other miscellaneous brands. The unified manual ice ranges from 9 taels 3 qian to 8 taels 4 or 5 qian. Five Happiness Ice products are indeed good, but they are too high, which not only hinders sales, but also creates opportunities for goods of equal value.</p>
<h3 id="e191">North and South Goods New Zhangyuan Has Been Opened <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Xianglian Land Price Firmly Rises</p>
<p>The first batch of new Zhangyuan that arrived the day before yesterday, yesterday I saw the sample. Because it was the first time to see the sample, there were very few vendors in the upper village, and most of them were small and medium-sized grains. The code Hongkai was 26 taels and a half, followed by about 19 taels, 13 or 4 taels, and 7 taels and 5 qian next. The market situation was flat and tired. The land price of the new Xianglian has suddenly turned tight recently. For example, the ordinary Zhuang Huashen needs about 57 taels, but the Shanghai market is low, and it cannot keep up with the high for a while, and the entry and exit have become upside down. The market is expected to gradually increase in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Various Seafood and Fish Maw in Short Supply and Prices Rising <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Mingbo Market Shows a Firm Trend</p>
<p>Regarding fish maw, from May to June, due to the arrival of new goods and abundant sources, the market declined continuously. However, now the production season is about to end, and the supply from various producing areas has greatly decreased. As a result, prices in both Shanghai and Ningbo have rebounded. Currently, top-grade long maw is selling for 180 taels, top-grade slice maw for 175 taels, hanging slice maw for 160 taels, moon maw for 170 taels, rice maw for 150 taels, and *Zha* fish maw for 210 taels. Merchants' inventories are now low, and the market is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<p>Regarding Mingbo dried octopus, the harvest from various producing areas this year is considered quite abundant, with an estimated total of over 20,000 *dan*. However, the selling price is reasonable, and sales are also robust. Since the arrival of new goods, over one-third has already been sold. The current market price for ordinary goods is 18 taels, *Shengshan* goods are 20 taels, selected grades are 23 taels, and top-grade large slices are 26 taels, an increase of about one tael compared to the previous period. It is also reported that merchants' inventories have all been dried and prepared for winter sales, so there is no concern about a market downturn.</p>

<p>Total Inventory Less Than 30,000 *Dan*: Mostly Medium and Low-Grade Goods. According to the registration and inspection by the Reeling Committee, the total amount of old dried cocoons from various districts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang stored in Shanghai foreign firms was about 20,000 *dan*. These old cocoons are mostly mortgaged to the financial sector, so the pawnshops and banks that hold the mortgages entrust the cocoons to silk factories to be reeled into silk and stored in foreign firms. With the recent surge in silk sales in Europe and America, most of the stored silk has been sold. The current remaining inventory of old cocoons is estimated to be less than 30,000 *dan*, mostly medium and low-grade goods, suitable only for reeling B and C grade silk, about 500 *dan* of which are white silk for domestic silk weaving demand.</p>

<p>The market for flannel wool fabrics began to turn around yesterday. The trend in the guild is significantly better than last week. Out-of-town merchants stationed in Shanghai are continuously placing orders for wool goods, *Huawei* flannel, serge, and thick fancy flannels for autumn and winter sales. Check *Huawei* flannel is selling for 2.8 taels, *Qiaoketing* for 2.89 taels, first-grade riding breeches fabric for 6.5 taels, and second-grade riding breeches fabric for 4.75 taels. Plain serge with regular colors is selling well, while gray is not popular. Yellow and regular colors are popular for *Huawei* flannel, while blue is ignored. As a result, sellers are more willing to compromise. Thick and thin raincoat fabrics are not doing well. The overcoat fabric market is relatively stable. If the weather turns cold and sales pick up, the market may turn around.</p>

<h3 id="e198">On Studying Abroad (Continued) <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>What I said yesterday, I haven’t fully expressed, so I will talk about it again today.</p>
<p>Students spend a lot of money and time studying abroad. If the purpose is just to obtain a doctoral or master's degree and return home to glorify their ancestors, there is no need to say anything. Even if they are truly going to study and seek knowledge, they should identify the right path. If they do not follow a reliable and useful path, but only a false and useless one, they will always be on the wrong path.</p>
<p>Therefore, students studying abroad must identify their goals, examine the root causes of China's poverty and weakness, and choose what China currently needs. They cannot be careless in their studies. What I least want to hear are titles like politics and economics. Now China has almost become a divided country, with politics off track and finances unmanageable. High-sounding talks about politics and policies are like forcing a square peg into a round hole. The old articles from foreign countries cannot be copied directly.</p>
<p>We cannot say that students who have become officials and gained positions are the achievements and effectiveness of studying abroad. These students cannot be considered beneficial to the country or society, but merely individuals showing off. Originally, [everyone knows how to do tricks, but each has their own skills]. Some rely on the title of studying abroad to jump onto the stage as key figures, while others try every means but cannot find a way out. Therefore, Zhuangzi said,</p>
<p>"A man of Song had a drug that prevented chapped hands, and his family had been doing laundry for generations. A guest heard about it and offered to buy the recipe for a hundred gold pieces. The guest obtained it and persuaded the King of Wu. The King of Wu made him a general, and he fought against the Yue people in winter, defeating them greatly and being granted land as a fief. The ability to prevent chapped hands was the same, but some were granted fiefs while others could not avoid doing laundry. The use of the drug was different."</p>
<p>Indeed, to be promoted and make a fortune, one must have the means and connections for promotion and wealth. If you have the title but no means or connections, it is useless. I heard a friend say that two students who studied abroad work in a certain institution and receive a monthly salary of twenty-four yuan. I am not calculating for students who have studied abroad, nor am I being stingy. Assuming that a student studies until graduation, the tuition fee is at least ten thousand yuan, and the time spent is fourteen or fifteen years. If this tuition fee were accumulated from childhood, it would be at least twenty thousand yuan after fourteen or fifteen years. If two thousand yuan were deposited in a bank, one could earn at least one hundred and sixty or seventy yuan in interest per month.</p>
<p>Now, students studying abroad work in certain institutions and only receive a salary of thirty-four yuan. How can this losing business be calculated? Some say that a person in the world is not born to be profitable, but must do something for society and contribute to the country in order not to waste a lifetime. However, merely doing some work in a company will not make a name for oneself. What I am saying is not to despise students who have studied abroad, but because students did not identify their goals before studying abroad, they ended up with such a result.</p>

<p>I am grateful that you love me so much, more than I love myself. You and I share the same words, and this feeling is true and genuine. At that time, I was blocked by jackals and wolves, and there was no way to see you. Now that the jackals and wolves are gone, how many decades will it take to wait for you? I have ten thousand years of tears, but how can I wet my clothes? Tears cannot flow, but surge into my bloodstream. My body is like a knife wound, and I sit up frequently. I scold the officials who ruined the country in the morning, and I scold the citizens who ruined the country in the evening. I hope you will come and scold together with me, to express the same suppression. We should especially buy fine wine and get drunk, flying away from the dust of robbery.</p>

<p>— Nu</p>
<p>I have always believed that schools should not just have students read a few books and write a few articles, and then call it a day. They should pay attention to practical work. In the past, schools mostly focused on the mouth, while forgetting the use of the hands. For example, speech contests and competitions are necessary extracurricular activities, but when attending physics and chemistry classes, they take novels to listen to lectures. Speech is also cannot be abolished, but [it is better to act than to talk]. This is what our young people should realize. In the current era, we Chinese cannot save ourselves by putting up a few slogans and giving a few speeches. Therefore, I hope that school authorities will change the previous handicraft classes, such as paper cutting and paper folding, which are close to consumption work and do not contribute to practical natural materials, into vivid and infinitely tasteful handicraft manufacturing. Since it can open up new financial resources for the school and cultivate real talents for social production, wouldn't it be killing two birds with one stone, achieving twice the result with half the effort? I am not talented, but I dare to share what I have learned in my daily research with the world, and I hope that those who understand will correct me.</p>
<p>1. Manufacturing Method of Master Sheet</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>(A) Master Sheet Used on *Zhenbi* Boards:</p>
<p>Raw materials: one *liang* of *Zhila* Nishi money, two *qian* of alum, eight *liang* of clear water, a small amount of *Julishilin* or sugar, and tough paper.</p>
<p>Manufacturing method: Soak the *Zhila* Nishi in two *liang* of clear water until it is completely dissolved, filter it, add a small amount of *Julishilin* or sugar, and soak the paper in this solution.</p>
<p>After it has penetrated, take it out and dry it in the shade. Then dissolve the alum in six *liang* of clear water, take out the paper that has been dried in the shade, soak it in the alum water for about five minutes, take it out, dry it, and it can be used.</p>
<p>(B) Master Sheet Used on Pen Boards:</p>
<p>Raw materials: one *liang* of turpentine oil, one *liang* of beeswax, two *liang* of paraffin, one and a half *liang* of chalk, and thin paper.</p>
<p>Manufacturing method: Put an enamel pot on a charcoal fire, put paraffin and beeswax in the pot, wait for it to dissolve, then add chalk and turpentine oil, and stir vigorously for about 20 minutes, remove from the heat and let it cool, then apply it to white paper, and it must be applied evenly. In this way, it becomes a top-grade master sheet after drying.</p>
<p>2. Ink Powder Manufacturing Method: As the saying goes, [writing is easy, but grinding ink is difficult]. Therefore, we often use ink, but it is inconvenient to carry. General elementary school students or travelers find that fountain pens are not enough, and it is very inconvenient to carry ink. Therefore, we have to create a kind of ink powder, the raw materials of which are: seven and a half *qian* of gum, four *liang* of gallnut, one and three *qian* of ferrous sulfate, and one *qian* of water sugar. Mix the above raw materials and grind them finely, sift them through a silk sieve, pack them into small paper bags, or store them in iron boxes like Tibetan *Rendan*. When using, just dissolve the powder with boiling water, and you can use it to write.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Debate on the Issue of Gender Equality in the Society Improvement Discussion <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Wudi</p>
<p>Seeing a paragraph on [the issue of gender equality] signed [Zhen] in Shanghai's local supplement, I can't help but disagree, so I'm here to say a few words. I think the wise editor will allow me to publish it!</p>
<p>Indeed, there is no equality between men and women. Solving this problem is not easy. In the minds of the people in our society, there is often a psychology of belittling and criticizing women. Therefore, when men commit adultery, people forgive them, saying: This is a common problem that young people can't avoid, and they will change over time. If a woman commits this so-called common problem of men, people will never recognize her as a person. Even those who are called reformers cannot avoid this biased view. Is this the reason for respecting women's personality? Now, the author of the [issue of gender equality], his criticism of women also has the inferiority of belittling and criticizing women, and his biased views are naturally revealed. First, I have to ask him how women can become the perfect person he thinks they should be? According to the three types he mentioned:</p>
<p>The first type cannot be said to be relying on men as slaves to men. However, the lack of awareness in their thinking is due to their suffering from the oppression of a bad environment and the pity of not receiving a good education! If men use this to coerce women, then it seems too critical. Because the difference between them is only one is serving society, and one is serving the family. Isn't this the same responsibility? If it is said that the economic burden of the family is solely borne by men, this is unfair. Then I must ask whether the affairs in the family are solely managed and labored by women? Rights and obligations are of course relative. Do men all work for the public without taking a penny from society? If it is said that relying on men must be a slave to men, then men also live under the roof of others and rely on others to live. Are they slaves? If it is said that men have fulfilled a duty to society, and then get a reward, this is without guilt: Then, for the same reason, do women not fulfill their duties at home? Moreover, all the expenses in the family cannot be said to be provided by the husband for the wife to enjoy alone. What the wife enjoys is the reward she deserves. If they are indeed jointly responsible for their children, but the wife has fulfilled the responsibility of childcare, shouldn't the husband fulfill the responsibility of providing for them?</p>
<p>The second and third types say: Women are men's toys. I see that men want to be women's toys and can't get them. It's really all of them: [Willing to serve at the makeup table to cater to her eyes] is the proud work of your refined men! Wearing one or two new clothes is said to be a toy: Then what is the intention of men wearing a suit in the morning and a suit in the evening, applying snow cream, and spraying perfume! Regarding the social arena, what kind of people are making all kinds of ugly things in order to please women? Whose toys are they? There are indeed many scum in the women's world, but I am afraid that men are more than that! We are grateful for the well-intentioned advice, so that today's women can see a ray of dawn in the darkness: But this kind of abusive attitude and biased prejudice should not come from scholars! If it is said that serving society and devoting themselves to housework, doing two things alone is enough, but it is still critical that they have not borne the living expenses of the family. This really shows the author's selfish thing! If men can share half of the responsibilities of housework, then women should also share half of the economic responsibilities of the family. Otherwise, it is biased and unfair! If it is said that housework is not what men are good at, so it should be done by women alone: Then if women take care of housework and men provide for the family, it should not be said that women rely on men!</p>
<p>Finally, I want to ask our female compatriots not to swallow their voices and endure this unreasonable humiliation and scolding, so that people think that women can be bullied and take the opportunity to be presumptuous!</p>

<p>— Qiangyuan</p>
<p>[Thinking of the crisis in Koubei Yingzi, the Japanese army has mobilized more than 120,000 troops in Guanwai, thinking back to my dance name, and I am still making a fuss about resignation, retention, and persuasion, which is enough to make us anxious!]</p>
<p>[The Scarlet Blood Assassination Group presented a bomb to the Asia Bookstore Company. This was the reward that treacherous merchants deserved. The Japanese army favored them again and sent two people to protect him,]</p>
<p>[Everything, thinking about it, will make us discouraged! China really doesn't know how bad it will get!] Qijun said sadly and excitedly while dragging me along. Originally, we were walking very quickly, but after Qijun said a series of words, we unconsciously became clumsy, just lazily dragging our feet, always bowing our heads low. Naturally, this expression would not be very energetic. At this time, we walked again and again and had already reached a noisy place. Originally, we were walking without choosing a road. When we raised our heads and looked, oh! It turned out to be the entrance of the X amusement park. No wonder there is such a noisy and prosperous scene!</p>
<p>[Qi: Don't worry about the country, look at these people who are enjoying themselves while they can! I grabbed Qi and stopped at the entrance of the amusement park.</p>
<p>[Hum!] Qi only made a sound from his nostrils, and did not say anything else, showing that he was very unwilling. Then we looked at the lively situation at the entrance and exit of the amusement park. We only saw three or two people squeezing in, and the four ticket sales holes seemed to never be empty. At the same time, the entrance was still constantly being dragged by rickshaw pullers bending over, or ferried by the No. 11 bus (walking on two legs is called the No. 11 bus, probably a fashionable buzzword). Among them were girls and women wearing long cheongsams, workers wearing blue short shirts, and young people wearing silk long gowns and beautiful suits, all showing excitement and rushing to the dark entrance. Later, we found a policeman in a yellow uniform squeezed in, and then a serving soldier in a gray military uniform also strolled inside.</p>
<p>[Hi!] Qi took a breath at this time, grabbed me and continued, [Let's go! China's disease has really entered the bone marrow! Originally, Rehe is too far away from here, unless another [January 28] incident is staged, it may scare them!]</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>I respectfully address the gentlemen of Shanghai's local supplement, since your journal created a science column to enhance the knowledge and interests of humble people, I now see that Mr. Fumin's method of printing images uses silver nitrate (one part nitric acid to ten parts water), I do not know if one part silver nitrate is mixed with ten parts water, or after mixing silver nitrate, then nitric acid and water are used. Also, the handkerchief image printing method asks whether this image will also be washed away since the handkerchief is often washed. I respectfully send this letter to ask Mr. Fumin for clarification and also ask for the address so that I can inquire directly. I am grateful for the trouble.
