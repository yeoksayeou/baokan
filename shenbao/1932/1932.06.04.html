<p>時評</p>
<h3>再釋對蘇復交彬</h3>
<p>自本報提出對蘇復交主張後。社會不少贊同之聲。同時亦不少反對之聲。上月三十一日虚白先生在大晚報發表「再論對俄復交並答申報彬君」一評。對復交問題提出疑問多點。雖見智見仁。所見各異。然而此種辯論。要自極有意義。故亦願就所質各點。加以闡釋。</p>
<p>關於復交聯蘇容共三者。爲不容相提並論之三事。及中國現狀爲最適合於共産主義滋長之泥土。無堅强政府之樹立。嚴密社會之組織。安定人民之生活。决不能防遏共産主義之滋長蔓延數點。虚白先生旣已表示同意。在此自不必再加論列。惟虚白先生最後提出之「當初爲什麽要對蘇俄絕交。」</p>
<p>及「現在主張復交是否已解决了這些條件」兩問題。至關重要。或且正爲多數人所共有之疑問。此兩問題如不能解答。則吾人所提對蘇復交之主張。殆眞爲不顧事實之謬論。然而其然豈其然乎。</p>
<p>民十六我國對蘇絕交。政府所持之理由。爲「蘇俄主使並參加共産黨暴亂。破壞國民革命。不得不採取斷然之處置。」民十八中東路一役。眞如大公報所謂「亦本不應有。」（見五月十九日社評再論對俄復交問題）但年來湘鄂贛皖閩共黨勢力之日益披猖。實在對蘇絕交之後。東北一隅。十六年後對蘇仍互派領事。然而東北共黨勢力。並不如南方之張大。則吾人殆不能不承認以對蘇絕交防遏共黨之政策。已完全歸於失敗故謂絕交爲反蘇聯則可。謂爲防遏共産則不可。蓋事實已證明絕交實未能防遏共産也。</p>
<p>至於「現在主張復交是否已解决了這些條件」之問題。亦可不必費辭而解答矣。一九二七年英保守黨内閣小題大做。藉口所謂「阿柯斯房屋搜」</p>
<p>查」而對蘇絕交。迨一九二九年英工黨重握政權。即行復交。豈在保守黨内閣時代。遂無法防遏「赤化」之宣傳。而在工黨内閣時代。遂無所顧忌耶。反之保守黨内閣對蘇絕交。遂果眞已使英國共産主義之宣傳絕跡耶。故吾人謂絕交爲反蘇聯則可。謂爲防共則不可。此蓋爲必然之理也。</p>
<p>脫爲昔日絕交。今日遂不應復交。則又失之爲「機械論。」外交但問其目前有利與否。不當固守成局。今日就國際情勢言。復交爲對我有利。吾人前已言之。抑又有進者。就國際貿易言。我國對歐美日本各國貿易。向爲入超。獨對蘇爲出超。絕交而後。我茶葉皮毛兩業。蒙受打撃至大。脫今日復交。則在貿易上於我當亦有利。雖蘇聯近年厲行「探併政策。」傾銷産品。但其售出之貨。果眞價格低廉。於我仍爲無害。又况蘇聯邇年。以專心致力於五年計畫之故。亦已改變曩日進取之外交政策爲退守政策。此亦爲最明顯之事實。脫必謂昔日對蘇絕交。今日對蘇不可復交。是則我國今後應永不能與蘇復交矣。此又果於我有利耶。</p>
<p>總之吾人認爲就國際情勢言。就中蘇之關係言。我國以對蘇復交爲有利。至於防遏共産。則在於修明内政。安定民生。虚白先生亦已同此意見矣。絕交徒樹敵。决不能防遏共産主義之流行也。</p>

<p>（南京）記者三日訪羅外長、叩詢最近外交問題、承接見、答復如次、上海方面日陸戰隊未能依照協定撤退至一二八前原防、已由共同委員會我方委員進行交涉、此次日陸軍撤退之迅速、實超過停戰協定預定之程期、則海軍陸戰隊當然亦可按照協定精神、從事撤退、此事共委會當可解决、不成問題、中日糾紛之癥結、在東北問題、蓋東北問題爲中日糾紛之因、而上海問題則爲其果也、現調查團親往東北調查業已竣事、四日將由瀋啓程返平、從事編製報告書、大約六七八三個月將爲編製報告書時期、至九月間、國聯當可根據此項報告、召集會議討論、以求解决、但國聯已往對中日問題、所能表現之能力、與夫日本所能服從國聯决議之程度、國人當已當悉、故國聯此次能否使中日糾紛得一圓滿解决、係一極大問題、求人不如求已、吾人之出路、仍在精誠團結、充分表現民族之精神與力量、此次調查團赴東北所得之印象、頗爲良好、對我頗能表示同情、蓋日本爲强者、爲侵略者、我乃弱者、被侵略者、事實俱在、公理昭彰、該團雖欲對我不表同情、亦不可得也、但同情爲一事、中日糾紛能否因此同情而得圓滿之解决、爲又一事、故吾人亦可不必因此同情而自滿自得、至外傳圓桌會議之說、甚至謂英美法意等國亦同意日方所主張召集之說、則純爲日方之片面宣傳、我國在原則上雖不反對召集國際會議、以解决中日糾紛、但祇爲討論上海安全問題之會議、則我國絕對不能同意、中俄復交問題、關係至爲重大、中央對此問題、當然須權衡利弊之輕重、作詳細審愼之考慮、如俄方能有誠意、復交亦非不能、關於使領館經費、以前積欠至巨、余任外長後、雖對内部之經費極力節省、但對所領得之使館經費、則完全發放、計第一個月三成、第二個月五成、第三個月十足發給、現與財部商洽、宋部長亦深知使領館之重要、允極力籌撥、一俟經費問題解决、則對人選之補充整頓、當然須繼續進行、大約經整頓之後、使領館經費每月可節省七八萬元、現駐日蔣公使·駐英郭公使·不日即將出國、以後外交之喉舌、當可日趨健全云、聞羅外長於滬戰爆撥時、出任鉅艱、折衝樽俎、頗爲辛勞、且以原任司法行政部長、職務繁忙、曾一再呈請中央懇辭外長兼職、現經中央懇切慰留、决仍繼續負責云、（三日中央社電）</p>

<h3>日特議會開會齋藤宣布外交方針</h3>
<p>對俄維持邦交對華積極侵略</p>
<p>謀努力促成圓桌會解决滬案</p>
<p>决採堅實的步驟併吞我東北</p>
<p>路透社三日東京電　今晨日本第六十二届議會開會、首相齋藤蒞會宣布新内閣外交政策如左、</p>
<p>余乘此時機潢、略述吾國對外關係之最近發展、上海中日戰事於五月五日簽定停戰協定後、今已見上海區域迅速恢復和平狀態、此殊可令人欣慰者也、此協定談判之際、曾發生種種困難、幸賴駐華英使與其他友邦代表竭力斡旋、及吾人所抱之公允正直態度、乃得圓滿結局、此余所當一述者、余並乘此時機、對奮力作戰上海之陸海軍將士表示深切之感忱、協定條件、爲華軍應留駐所開距上海若干哩之處、並當停止一切敵對行動、如華軍之任何行動足以發生恐慌、則英美法意代表將從事查明眞相、此項條件長此遵守、則上海區域之華軍、似不致再引起新騷亂、至少暫時可免有此、職是之故、政府乃决議調回、上海區域所有之陸軍、蓋倚賴協定之實施與各友邦擔保上海永遠和平所取之行動也、余敢决完全撤退軍隊、足以表示政府屢次宣言此番出兵無任何政治野心之眞誠、惟今所訂者、僅爲中日軍隊停戰之條件、至於奠定上海之永遠和平、尚未作何計劃、今絕對必要者、如須維持以數十年和平經營造成之國際大商市之繁榮、則當另取可令上海中外人民安居樂業之步驟、如上海能免除近今及往日時常發生騷亂之危險、則不特爲中外居民之福、且將爲中國全部及與中國有關係各國之福、故余切望日政府所願之圓桌會議能早日召集、而告成全功、此爲國聯行政會二月二十九日通過之决議案所計及、而中國亦予以同意者、滿洲今已成立新國、具有新政見、而進步殊爲可觀、余知吾國對於滿洲國之前途、至爲關切、此爲自然應有者、余信在關於所謂滿案之任何國際調整中、不再有漠視該國存在之可能、余意新國之達到健全發展、實爲遠東安寗及滿洲和平與繁榮之恢復上至重要之舉、惟新政府之力量、尚不足恢復境内之秩序、而常受外界慫恿之匪兵與不法份子之活動、亦至難戡平、因此事態之故、滿洲日軍乃不得不擴張其必要合作、對新政府盡保護之責、並預防危及吾國人民生命財産、或引起大規模騷亂之意外事變、今服務滿洲之軍警、生命日處於危險中、此吾人所當深謝者、徵諸他國之歷史、凡遭如滿洲近今發生之政治變動、輒有觖望者與不法份子之活動、即無外界之慫恿、亦不能免、如是則新國之政府機關、必需歲月始能充分安穩、余對滿洲事變之進行、極反對操切從事、欲求該問題之適當解决、時間實爲必要、滿洲近勢、使日軍不得不在北滿剿治中國匪兵、以保護該地日僑、吾人之時時尊重蘇俄在該地之合法權益、與竭力審愼不加侵害、此於日軍作戰時之行動中已明白表示之、且日政府關於進兵北滿、已屢向蘇俄政府保證不外乎保護日僑之生命財産、余覺外間雖有日俄將因滿案以干戈相見之流言、而蘇俄政府必能充分體諒吾人之地位、余又覺當懇請全國以好意審别是非、勿爲謡言所惑、國聯之密切注意上海之發展、此爲君等所知者、當停戰談判暫時頓挫之際、中國曾將此事提出國聯、而引起糾紛、但國聯因見上海談判可保成功、故遂决議藉在上海談判之方法、以消除困難、因於四月三十日召集國聯大會特别會議、通過請上海談判迅速結局之决議案、日代表關於實施國聯會章第十五條以解决中日爭端、曾先提出抗議、故是日對决議案不加投票、國聯調查團今方實地調查、吾人已予以種種可能的便利、使團員得盡其職務、余切望該團對於中國與滿洲現有之實况、能作正確公允之見解、至吾人今日對於各國關係之事件、乃國際的政治的經濟的整理問題、自二月起在日内瓦舉行之軍縮會議、多與該問題有關、此爲討論一般軍縮從來未有之大會議、其會務歷時必久、日本擬堅主所提出之各點、而爲其已定政策之一部分、吾人切望該會議能爲世界之經濟與商業計、告成所期望之結果、總之國際商業途中現已置有重大之障碍、此爲各國希圖保護本國實業所採行往日無與爲比之各種計畫之結果、固不能否認者也、日本曾竭其能力、銷除其對外貿易之障碍、因此乃與萄葡牙締結商約、又與越南締結稅則條約、然世界今日皆受無限之痛苦、其中以不景氣最爲劇烈、許多問題、僅能以國際行動解决之、而吾國對外關係之前途、實含有至大之困難、故全國之宜團結一致、尤當勝前、解脫此種困難、端賴諸君之贊助與合作、余亦自當竭余棉薄、以與諸君共圖之云云、</p>
<p>路透二日東京電　路透電社曾向首相齋藤詢問俄日邦交問題、今日承專函答覆函中否認俄日邦交非常緊張之謡言、但又表示切望蘇俄停止出兵於遠東、而對日置較大之信任、俄之出兵遠東、實爲兩國邦交緊張無稽謡言發生之主要原因、至蘇俄建議締結互不侵犯協約、渠信兩國之締結此約、殊足减弱凱洛格非戰公約之力量、且等於成立特别親交、此恒爲各國之所忌、又稱、蘇俄不能藉口其在中東鐵路之利益、以排拒日本在滿洲之利益、滿洲之門户開放政策、要宜尊重各方已得之利益、而不計其屬於何國、故謂日本應享他國在中東鐵路所有之任何利益、渠殊不以爲然也、函中後又聲明數點、爲（一）希望使日本退出國聯之事勢不致發生、（二）日本與滿洲並未計議關稅聯合或聯盟、（三）承認滿洲國之舉、視該國證明力能自已維持爲定、（四）併吞滿洲、確無此意、日本且不欲非法控制滿洲當局之政策、齋藤定明日在議會宣布外交政策、</p>
<p>路透三日東京電　日首相齋藤子爵在國會宣佈政府行政方針、其演詞要旨、爲銷除國内不安寗之現象及保持生活穩定之必要、首相陳述經濟不景氣、致使農業區域感受嚴重困苦、而都邑亦備感時艱、情形極爲暗淡、謂政府决盡力維持和平與秩序、援助失業人民、恢復農家生計之穩定生活狀况、並减少金融界困難、又謂政治亟宜澄清非黨派之政府、將請兩大政黨予以扶助、但對於兩黨毫無偏倚、新内閣之目的、在剗除國内現有之痼疾、實現要求政治改良者之願望　並博取國人之信任云、</p>
<p>路透三日東京電　今日午後議會開會、陸相荒木對於五月十五日士官生在東京所行之暴案、表示深切之歉忱、並痛詆暗殺行爲之卑鄙、而損及陸軍之威望、故渠特抒誠謝罪云云、閣員對於荒木之言、曾加抨撃、問以因何不引咎辭職、荒木答稱、渠曾再四思維、覺處此擾攘之時局、忠君之道、莫善於留職盡瘁云、</p>
<h3>德保守派領袖巴本組成新閣</h3>
<p>與希黨約法三章藉維政權</p>
<p>中央黨與保守派裂痕深刻</p>
<p>國會决定解散兩月内改選</p>
<p>外交策不變袪除法人疑懼</p>
<p>國民社二日柏林電　德閣潮倐然而作、倐然而止、頗有兎起　落之觀、總統興登堡與各派領袖會晤後、即於卅一日晚降命巴本組織新閣、</p>
<h3>新閣閣員宣誓就職</h3>
<p>國民社一日柏林電　巴本新内閣今日下午在總統前宣誓就職、隨開第一次正式閣議、未幾即散、現定明日下午續開閣議、草議新内閣宣言、衆料新閣無意應付國會、在一二日内將下解散命令、新閣員名單如下、</p>
<p>總理巴本·外長紐拉恩男爵、内長蓋爾男爵、國防希賴謙將軍、財長克羅雪克伯爵、司法歸德納博士、農業白朗男爵、交通兼郵務吕平那克男爵、經濟暫兼勞工汪謨博德教授、</p>
<p>按此次閣員全屬保守派、且皆無甚政黨色彩、即總理巴本原屬天主教中央黨、自接受組閣新命後、即正式宣告脫黨、考新總理巴本爲致仕軍官、歐戰前曾服務參議部及駐美大使署陸軍參贊、戰後入政界、隸天主教中央黨、三次當選普魯士議會議員、但常以保守主義與黨中領袖齟齬、故最近改選普議會、未曾候選、今次出組内閣、僅爲解散國會辦理新選舉之過渡作用、並爲對外應付洛桑會議起見、故在現國會内基礎極爲薄弱、</p>
<h3>决定下令解散國會</h3>
<p>國民社二日柏林電　德新總理巴本已决定避免對付國會難關、於就職之後立即解散國會、按照憲法於六十日内辦理新選舉、此種决議現信係昨夜天主教中央黨一致通過議案、指新内閣爲塡擋内閣、非該黨所能容忍之結果、蓋該議案不僅使該黨將守中立、俾新總理在國會内可得多數之希望化爲烏有、且其措辭亦將益深中央黨與保守派之裂痕、</p>

<p>國民社二日巴黎電　法名人白禮朗在消息報刊載一文、力闢法報對於德新政府將爲法國威脅物之疑懼稱、德新總理巴本並不敵視法國、此於巴氏曾任法德妥協委員會委員一舉可以證明、又謂法國若信德新總理不能在未來國際會議中、代表德國全國發言、亦屬大謬、巴本才智超絕、爲保守派之傑出人才、而保守派今日在德國羽黨繁多云、</p>
<h3>承認希黨三項要求</h3>

<p>路透三日柏林電　新任國防總長施萊</p>
<p>轍今日告國民軍曰、余將注意鞏固吾國民精神與體力所寄之軍隊、此爲吾人國防所必要之根本、余將盡吾能力、使國民軍能保護德國疆界、與保障國家之安全、其詞咄咄驚人、</p>

<p>路透一日倫敦電　聞國際會議之動機、係緣華盛頓某大員最近有提及美國參加是項會議之限制、倫敦方面遂進一步、與美國開始討論、同時參加洛桑會議各國亦均預聞其事、駐英之美法意大使、時與英外部接洽、</p>
<p>國民卅一日華盛頓電　今日美國務院已訓令駐英大使梅隆通知英政府、美國認召集世界經濟會議計劃、對於今日凋疲之經濟、有眞正價值、但國務卿史汀生仍鄭重聲稱、此種國際經濟會議、并不討論戰債賠欵或軍縮等事件、所議將以純粹經濟事件爲限、按英國駐美大使林德賽曾赴國務院詢問、倘召集經濟會議美國將否參加、故國務院今日訓令梅隆答復英廷云、</p>

<h3>古廟敲鐘錄（十二）不除庭草齋夫</h3>
<p>十四</p>
<p>春生哥，宋老太和我約好第二天早晨一同進城去請先生。我怕當天晚上或者不能回來，便把敲鐘的事付托給小和尚，並細細的教了他一番。我們吃過早飯就動身。宋老太太是時常到城裏去過的。春生哥雖然也挑過柴火進城賣，但是柴一賣了就回來，對於城裏的風光他實在嘗得很少。我呢，一個十足的鄕下老。我進城好比是上學，宋老太便是我的老師。我的脚步一踏進城，就覺得樣樣東西與鄕下不同。我一路走，一路問，宋老太也津津有味的回答我，我是多麽的幸福啊！</p>
<p>我們進了城門，走不得多少路，便見一個漆黑的大東西比馬還快的衝來，把我們前面的一隻老牛，駭得亂跳。宋老太說，汽車來了，留心些。老實說我也像那條老牛一般，吃了一大驚，忙著向路邊退，只見牠一陣風過去，灰塵撲得我滿臉，不是我眼睛夾得快，若把灰塵弄到眼睛裏去如何得了。奇怪丨牙床怎麽齊察起來？灰塵到我嘴裏去白相了。原來這路呌做馬路，不是人走的。我就是這樣一路吃灰吃的去，嘴裏哼出了幾句話：</p>
<p>大老倌兒坐汽車。</p>
<p>小老倌兒坐洋車。</p>
<p>没得車坐的吃灰。</p>
<p>春生哥，宋老太聽了都大笑而特笑。當我們走進一條小街的時候，看見一位大姑娘在前面走著。這姑娘奇怪！她没有梳頭也不拖辮子。有點像尼姑，但是尼姑是剃得光光的，這姑娘的頭髮却比尼姑養得長。宋老太說：「這是城裏最時髦的女學生。你們看她脚上的皮鞋，和從前假小脚一樣，這呌做高跟皮鞋。不多時，我們趕上了這位女郎，迎面來了一個頑皮的孩子，對著她嘻皮笑臉的唱道：</p>
<p>二道毛，</p>
<p>笑嘻嘻，</p>
<p>三言兩語成夫妻。</p>
<p>宋老太說：「唱得一點也不錯。」我問，「二道毛怎麽講？」她說：「從前女　」孩子總要剪一回頭髮，使牠容易長得好些。這些女學生是剪第二回了，所以呌做二道毛。我想是這樣講，不曉得錯不錯？」</p>

<h3>證劵售價回小數角</h3>

<p>週四紐約股市、因銷售稅案已經參院接受、人心轉好、各方始作維持證劵行市之謀、銀行方面亦協力收買公債、以維持債價、主要商品、如棉麥等類、價均趨漲、是日證劵市塲、初因公用股之疲軟、頗足影響市氣、後因買者踴躍、價復趨堅、攸愛斯鋼股、漲起二·三二鎊音、最爲可觀、鐵道股平均漲０·九二、據傳國際石油會議、英·美·蘇俄諸國對於維持市價、尚無具體方案、但週四汽油股價值殊爲堅挺也、綜觀各方形勢、已顯佳象、業外者興趣漸濃、故市面大見熱鬧、週四成交一百九十萬股爲數週以來所未有、最近如無特殊變化、則前日所見之最低價或不致再落矣、週四之道瓊斯指數如左</p>

<h3>紗花紗市稍稍回好</h3>
<p>棉紗市情、因上日大跌之後、今則微見回風、市氣略佳、華南一埠採辦尚未斷絕、本埠一般心理、以其底盤已小、做多心思殊濃、然測之世界大勢、異常悲觀、查某國二十支紗價在當地價祇合一百十七兩七錢、滬埠二十支人鐘紗價一百六十三兩外、相兩比較、差價甚遠、所以上海日廠暗中進行猛力、華北一帶祇其閉塞、華紗絕跡且内地長江一路、亦沉悶不動、以經濟不振、農民購買力較弱、目前以粤帮進胃尚健、尚能維持、前途無多大樂觀云、</p>
<p>人標市氣轉優　人標前市開盤、以美棉回漲、塲内市氣稍好、各月回漲三四五錢、午後聞實需良好、各月又漲二四五錢、全日成交統計五千四百五十包、查賣出吉豐三百五十包、裕康三百五十包、大昶三百五十包、元泰三百包、買進義餘二百五十包、義成二百五十包、信誠三百五十包、長豐五百包、仁豐三百包、兹將收盤價分列如下、</p>

<p>總計　一二三、八五０</p>
<p>實需粤胃不弱　現紗銷路尚好、查全日各帮買去一千一百五十包、期貨七百包、行情漲二錢半至五錢、客帮由四川進一百七十包、蕪湖進三十包、寗波進二十包、廣東進七百二十五包、長沙進二十五包、内地進二十五包、雲南進八十包、鎭江進六十包、北帮進五包、徐州進期貨四百包、汕頭進期貨三百包云、</p>
<h3>標棉跟美棉轉機</h3>
<p>棉市略佳、美棉回好、人心稍振、獲利者扒空、然採算銀盤米特令棉祇售卅一二兩、查美棉上日到五分、此低價爲近數十年間所未有、在此情形之下、市面極難起色、故貿易公司手中現棉、鑒於各廠絕無銷胃、祇得向期貨市塲紛紛套出、由此市盤難以站住、上日跌一兩、今隨外棉回好而漲三四錢、然大户依然抛賣不絕、照外棉情形論之、棉市前途、仍屬看疲云、</p>
<p>鄭標回漲三四錢　鄭標前市開盤、美棉雖漲、人氣平平、各月祇漲一二錢、午後散户抵空、漲二錢、全日成交數統計二萬五千一百擔、查賣出同孚一千六百擔、益昶一千八百擔、源大一千五百擔、天成一千三百擔、長豐六百擔、仁豐九百擔、買進吉豐一千五百擔、恒益一千擔、仁豐一千三百擔、長和一千一百擔、長豐八百擔、同興七百擔、兹將收盤價分列如下、</p>

<p>紗交前對於花紗本證一項、改用現金代用品各半、已於二日起將現金一半取銷、仍照舊章、統用代用品、因此生意較爲起色云、</p>
<h3>美棉回漲英埃續跌</h3>
<p>昨日美棉因華爾街有力同業買進、買户增加而堅、計期貨漲二十至二十四磅音、現貨漲二十五磅音、英棉期貨跌十一至十三點、現貨跌九點、埃及棉現貨跌十點、印棉停市、原電錄左、（二日電）</p>

<h3>絲茶江隂早蠶繭産歉質劣</h3>
<p>繭行開秤者少：：價祇十五六元</p>
<p>江隂大小青暘及長壽等鄕、今歲所育之早蠶、因受天時之損害、在三四眠中、蠶蟻大半傾棄、上簇後又雷雨奇寒、致吐絲不足、繭産奇歉、而繭身又均薄劣、繭行開秤者少、統計祇有四五家、而選貨頂眞、限價秤收、是以繭價祇開十五六元、蠶户類均用土灶烘焙、至各鄕補育之晚蠶、亦因雨多天寒、發育遲滯、早帮祇上簇作繭、不利蠶收、難望轉豐云、</p>
<h3>屯溪珍眉已有動機</h3>
<p>本埠屯溪珍眉綠茶、自上星期開盤後、市面停滯已閱多日、華茶商鑒於局勢惡劣、不得不讓價求售、日昨已由怡和協和同孚等行、開始動辦、做開市盤、自一百兩至一百二十兩、較前見跌三四十兩、遂安珍眉去路亦轉趨暢達、惟市盤跌進百兩關内、華商均須虧折、祁門浮梁等路紅茶、英倫市塲、需求尚殷連日英商行家、搜買仍不遺餘力、售盤均無重大變動、紅綠茶市勢已入常軌、交易有繼續發展之望云、</p>
<h3>皖贛新茶彚聞</h3>
<p>屯溪茶號開始揀製</p>
<p>休邑新茶、經山户旬日採製、新貨上市、漸見湧旺、屯埠各號爲趕製運滬搶新、及得滬市紅茶新盤消息後、紛紛出莊搜買、近日各村開秤者、有數十起、價由七十元逐漲至八十元、山户以求多供少、遂居奇貨、雖價在八十、仍未厭其慾心、號方無如何、只得與之議定跟高辦法、先開秤交茶、在約定限期内、照最高市盤算價、山户以此辦法無虧、亦多樂售、進茶較多之號、近日已開始揀焙、趕製抽身珍眉、月内可有新貨到滬、</p>
<p>餘干茶銷滯價小</p>
<p>餘邑本年茶産、旣早且嫩、雖四鄕匪患未消、人心尚能安定、各村新茶、月初已採製收園、惟因屬匪區、遠道茶客、多不敢入山搜辦、除饒州·河口·省帮·店莊稍有銷路外、洋莊辦者甚鮮、故山價卒難提起、市盤每擔僅售二十元零、現山户存茶未售者、仍有十分六七、</p>
<p>婺源新茶市盤已開出</p>
<p>婺邑茶號、近以各村新茶採製將竣、産量又告蝕收、爲免屯溪號販捷足、紛紛提前出號收買、除連日各派夥分向德興邊界及婺南搜辦外、現又遣員四出探盤、惟東北鄕新茶、多未採製竣工、對買方出盤、均認爲時機未至、殊鮮就範、邑南龍河谷雨嫩茶、昨開出新盤每担八十元、較上年見高三十元、此種市價、係出例外、非普通正市行情、今日邑屬下北三都、又由東鄕上坦茶號議定市盤六十二元、比舊見高十餘元、其他各村、尚鮮續盤開出、買賣雙方、刻正釀醖接洽開秤中</p>
<p>浮梁青茶開秤有待</p>
<p>浮屬東南青茶、近日出貨正旺、質味亦稱良好、山户將製就之茶、咸儲待沽、是地接近休境、休屯號販、已有至此議盤、山户以本年茶産折减、成本又大、羣望後來高價、此時不主急售、成交開秤絕少、最高莊之石頂毛峯、近日採辦者頗夥、市價每斤由六角逐漲至一元二角、因該處山高　長、茶葉出産極嫩、香味又較他處優厚、且合宜於洋店莊銷塲、山户因之不慮滯銷、每居奇貨、故開秤尚有待云、</p>
<h3>糧食河下米市轉硬</h3>
<p>滬南昨日豐記碼頭米市、各帮來源共五十餘號、常錫蘇同平黎約三十號、青角西塘十餘號、平湖松江七八號、本街店胃清淡、各貨開盤早市轉硬、及至午後、形勢軟弱、厚薄粳飛來鳳等一律定局、</p>
<p>滬北　蘇州河畔、昨到三十號左右早晨臨市者不見十分踴躍各貨開盤上落角許、常錫北粳與崑山米、頂緊次疲、薄稻早稻各短一角、糯米無榮辱、洋蘆尖乏貨無市、</p>
<h3>洋米銷停跌半角</h3>
<p>期敏黨續有抛出</p>
<p>昨洋米市况、各路客帮一律停辦、而洋行則續在兜賣、市面疲滯異常、行情立小五六分、後經本街與鄕莊暢辦、市乃疲定、期貨由沙遜洋行抛出敏黨六月期五百噸、價五兩二錢六分、亦比昨日跌小二分、現洋米開敏黨一千包、價十一元、小絞六百包、價十元零九角半至十元零八角、又陳米二百包、價十元零七角二分、又紅小絞二百包、價十元零零五分、陳糙一百包、價九元七角、茄辣地糙二百包、價十元零一角、客秈開台州白米二百包、價十元零五角七分、江西機元七百包、價十四元四角六分至十元零三角、統由本街收進云、</p>
<h3>粉交今日恢復市面</h3>
<p>現粉在清淡過程中</p>
<p>麫粉交易所定今日照常開拍、惟六月份停拍、自七月份拍起、昨現粉市面、又呈停寂疲滯之象、以客户心思、均因新麥登塲、銷塲見减、兼以金融放賬、尚未照常、即有交易、不過現進現出、不敢囤積、市面之清淡、不無關係也、昨初開二兩零三分二釐半、繼小至三分、依然出多進少、猶看疲軟、統市計有兵船三千包交易、餘不做開、惟兵船廠盤、仍喊二兩零三分七釐半、尚覺鎭靜云、</p>
<h3>南北貨碼生晒肉久斷有到</h3>
<p>石碼生晒肉、已久無到貨、實以地頭存少價昻所致、昨聞前日濟南輪入口、到有數件、尚未見樣、據聞成本頗高、如果包澤紅潤、肉瓣厚大、當屬好銷、惟週來出口去胃不多、而本街走塲亦有限、故市價恐難過高也、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白劃市步漲</h3>
<p>本廠冰開升一錢</p>
<p>糖市公會昨日市塲劉盤、交易尚盛、但出户均寥、市氣頗爲挺秀、荷糖二十四號粗砂白成交價升十三兩七錢半至八錢香港貨十三兩六錢、市仍俏秀、十號荷赤九兩七錢半至八錢、趨勢亦强、太古糖天津來Ｂ嘜十六兩三錢、原來ＣＸ嘜十五兩六錢、Ｈ嘜址二兩三錢、交易不多、市象均屬穩秀、本廠冰以原料粗砂白之步高、市亦跟漲、一號貨十五兩五錢二號十五兩四錢、振記</p>
<p>等廠各有售出、比之前盤提漲一錢、市形則俏俐異常云、</p>
<h3>五金大結束期已過</h3>
<p>五金市漸臻活潑</p>
<p>五金交易、近來漸呈活潑氣象、蓋客帮以大結束期已過、而廠家點綴亦甚良佳、市上開出之貨爲數甚夥、極準雖一時不見增加、但之比先前已覺好起多多矣、紫銅昨成交三百餘担、價三十七兩五錢、法西釘昨亦開出六百餘桶、但係本廠貨居多、價無上落、新鉛絲·新鐵絲長江帮辦去百餘擔、行情新鉛絲較挺、而新鐵絲略疲、青鉛昨佔十三兩四錢、交易不多、馬口鐵有大宗批出、係廠方辦進、惟行情一節、亦少進出、新洋元剪口鐵三角鐵·等均有談判、惟市無榮辱云、</p>

<p>我方委員决再繼續交涉</p>
<p>關於日兵撤退問題共同委員會我方委員俞鴻鈞·温應星·兩氏、業於前日正式致函日委岡崎、要求迅即履行協定精神、即日恢復一月二十八日以前原狀、兹悉日、方對於此事、昨已作復、函中祇述及以前日軍撤退之情形、並現下留滬日軍之部隊、對完全撤退問題、並未提及、我方委員對於此事表示須再繼續交涉、如果日方無誠意表示、决當提請中立國共同委員會解决此事云、</p>
<h3>郭泰祺談圓桌會議趨勢</h3>
<p>中日問題必須整個解决</p>
<p>自由市係少數外商空氣</p>
<p>外次郭泰祺氏、業於昨晨返滬、即將定期赴英、各報社記者、昨訪郭氏、叩以外傳圓桌會議問題、以及自由市等等問題、據郭氏談、圓桌會議、如能將中日整個問題、完全解决、則吾國方面、自當力促其成、若欲將東省與上海問題、劃爲兩途個别解决、則不特全國民衆、均將反對、即中央當局亦决不致盲然附和也、至上海自由市之謬說、完全係少數外商資本家散放之空氣、絕對無置信之價值、政府當局决計置之不理、東省與上海問題、中央决定整個六案、不容有所更變、本人赴英、現尚未定、如决定出國則啓程之期、尚須兩期後也云、</p>
<h3>和明函請召集圓桌會議</h3>
<p>未悉領袖領事</p>
<p>將來若何處置</p>
<p>大陸報云、上海和明商會、於六月一日、致函領袖領事克寗瀚、請上海領事團與外交團、從速協商早日召集圓桌會議、以期决定上海之將來地位、並解决中外間之各懸案、函内略謂、和明商會之委員會已贊成英僑協會召集圓桌會議之决議案、並聞上海美英法意日荷商會均已贊成此項計畫、目下有要事數件、關係上海之幸福與良好之政府、急待解决、因此種事件已引起誤會、發生衝突、致成重大爭案云云、另由英僑協會主席胡特海具名致函外交團、措詞相同、惟曾特别述及特區法院辦理不善、武裝軍隊出現上海、及界外築路三事、大陸報代表昨日（三日）向本埠各外商商會代表探詢彼等是否已贊成召集圓桌會議計畫、乃各代表諱莫如深、不肯直告、僅某商會之代表較爲爽直、承認所屬之商會、已贊成該計畫云、按各商會近來開會、皆嚴守秘密、前月三十一日曾以同式之函致和明商會、請竭力辦成斯舉、</p>
<h3>日方密促各國擴大租界</h3>
<p>於圓桌會議時提出討論</p>
<p>新聲社云、關於日軍之撤退問題、已將完全退盡、現所未退者、祇閘北區（即Ｄ區）及淞滬路綫以東、北四川路以西、老靶子路以北、虹口公園以南之區域、該區本係越界築路、現尚爲日本海軍陸戰隊所佔據、盤踞不願退去、雖經我方當局迭令俞温兩委員、請共同委員會與日方交涉、但仍無效果、昨日新聲社記者探得一驚人消息、即日當局刻正在向各國駐滬當局秘密進行、擬將該區域成爲租界、蓋越界築路問題、前者我方曾屢與工部局交涉、要求交還、惟工部局不願放棄、此項意外之權利、故毫無結果、今者日人即投其所好、密與各方留滬當道接洽、願將該區暫時佔領、而於將來開圓桌會議時、由日方提議、以該區爲擴大租界區、則爲各國共管、而實行該區早成爲日人商業勢力範圍下之區域、如成爲各國共管之租界、則不啻爲日人之租界、風聞我方當局已得悉此事云、</p>
<h3>第九師軍隊兩營昨日開到龍華</h3>
<p>擔任佈防南市等處</p>
<p>以後尚有續到部隊</p>
<p>滬南方面、於中日戰爭結束之際、我方駐紥之軍隊、退守後方、近爲維持該處秩序起見、故開始再駐軍隊、四五日前、曾開到憲兵兩連、分駐龍華警備司令部附近、前日又自滬杭路沿線之楓涇、開來第九師軍隊兩營、於昨日上午十一時到達龍華、此後將駐防龍華南市一帶、擔任該處防務、以後尚有續到、兹將到滬情形、誌之如下、</p>
<p>抵滬情形　第九師第五十團第一第二兩營、於昨晨十一時自楓涇開抵龍華、當時由團長謝輔三赴警備司令部與戴司令接洽、請示機宜、戴氏即令謝團長駐團部於龍華寺内、其第二營亦在寺内、第一營則駐於謹記路司令部附近、</p>
<p>佈防地點　第五十一團團營兵士抵滬後、聞將駐防於滬南龍華等處、因該處警備力量、祇賴公安局之保安隊、其爲單薄、故特派軍隊到來、以後尚有軍隊續到、俾地方安寗更得臻於鞏固也、</p>
<p>内容大概　該團二營、係受制於第九師、第九師師長即李延年、原係八十八師副師長、因淞滬抗日一役、甚著功</p>
<p>績、故升調第九師長、第一二兩營、實力頗爲雄厚、蓋係前黄埔教導團改編者也、</p>
<p>日方驚異　昨晨我方軍隊開到後、日方即得悉此項消息、共同委員會日代表岡畸、大爲驚詫、日當局亦反對、惟據我方當局談話、本國軍隊、在其領土之内、當然可以有絕對調動之權、日當局不得干預、况即根據停戰協定而言、則其對於中國軍隊之暫駐地、已有規定、不在規定之内者、亦可不受協定之節制云、</p>
<h3>市民地方維持會昨舉行閉會禮</h3>

<p>市長訓詞　市長吳鐵城訓詞云、在危難之中、貴會集合以應付一切地方事件、關於治安之維持、及軍事之供應、均能措置裕如、實</p>
<p>以貴會份子都屬社會中堅之故、當時政府毫無準備、貴會出而輔助、俾軍事得有月餘之持久、而難民之救濟、將士之慰勞、更見條理井然、成效卓著、使社會之活動力、各得充分發揮、其收效之宏速、比政府所作爲者尤大、現代表政府、敬謝貴會諸公之努力於社會國家、且尤希望貴會在形式上雖已結束、而此後努力、須比以前尤爲光大、蓋以社會國家之需要貴會諸公正切、未可從此息肩、不獨政府之仰賴已也、</p>

<p>虞王演說　虞洽卿演說云、此次本會之成立、史量才先生號召之力爲多、而政府方面、對於軍事、亦漸盡力、因得日兵撤退、結果損失雖多、土地未失、此皆吳市長之指導及市民爲國甘願犧牲、所以辦事精神、與日俱增、且日後事務甚多、尤望史會長繼續領導、王曉籟繼續演說、大致同上、</p>

<h3>海關巡艦與海盜激戰</h3>
<p>艦中洋員撃斃</p>
<p>水手抄班均傷</p>
<p>本埠江海關巡艦專條號Chuentiao、專任巡查漏稅貨件、昨日該艦在吳淞口外梭巡、詎至佘山洋面、突遇匪船、當即發生激戰、結果海關之洋員二人被殺、兹將此事經過分誌如下、</p>
<p>巡艦查察　江海關有巡艦專條·流星·及立慶·海星·等四艘、專任赴淞口及沿海偵察漏稅之貨、此次海關港務處接得報告、言吳淞口外有逃稅商輪數隻、係密裝大批鴉片及海洛英等毒品、希圖潛到淞口、轉運到滬、巡工司得報、即令巡艦專條號、開赴吳淞口外偵查、專條於二日下午三時駛出、沿途視察、直抵佘山洋面、始見大批貨船、遂上前檢查、</p>
<p>搜檢貨船　專條至佘山洋面、瞥見有貨船七八十艘、該巡艦便在該處抛泊、實地檢查、對於往來貨船、統令停駛候騐、專條艦中由洋員一人、華員兩人、執行搜查之責、逐一抄檢、先看各船關照、次查貨艙及機器間、頗爲周詳、以防私運之毒品渾過、而流入上海、</p>
<p>追舟遇盜　當查騐時、忽有數船、不遵巡艦候檢之命、便自行開駛而去、當時由專條艦懸旗警告令停、各船置之不理、駛航如故、專條艦乃開足馬力、上前追捕、蓋疑其船中或有毒品也、追至二海哩許、方得追及、即由艦中二副客奈爾上船、令示騐關照、復再派兩華員入艙抄查、有無毒品、詎該船之匪盜伏在船艙中者、即提槍向專條艦亂撃、而乃釀成慘劇、</p>
<p>艦盜交戰　海盜數人、在船出水槍關槍向專條艦掃射、同時在頭艙及後尾之各海盜、亦各出木壳槍對巡查人員亂放、此時大副客奈爾見勢不佳、急令水手數人各取步槍機關槍還撃、奮勇抵抗、客奈爾乃身中槍彈、由胸口而入、當塲畢命、而同時又有二副華人及水手頭目華人、亦各中彈、立時倒斃在艦、此外尚有水手等三人、各受重傷、</p>
<p>海星往援　此事發生時、艦中即發無綫電至江海關報告、巡工司得報、立大之巡艦海星號、亦開足速率、飛往佘山洋面助救、並帮同剿匪、詎該盜船在撃斃專條洋員後、便乘海面有霧、而潛行逃走、專條在後緊追、雖冒重霧、亦所不惜、受傷之各華員、當由海星艦先行轉載回滬、直至今晨三時十五分、方到海關碼頭、海關急派醫生孫孟屏到艦施行急救療治、然後將受傷者移送醫院、</p>
<p>協同勦追　專條艦昨日已經返滬、死亡之洋員尸體、亦運還上海、此事發生後、本埠海軍方面、已與水上公安隊及海關當局、協謀會同剿滅之計、因淞口發現大批海盜、殊與航運旅行之安全、有重大之關係也、</p>
<p>水手死亡　由海星救回之水手、當時經新閘救火會派車送到仁濟醫院、水手中苗富一名、四十一歲、彈傷大腹及背部、至昨日一點五十分、因傷重而死、又李炳來廿一歲、傷大腿、骨已爲彈撃斷、又羅子恒、三十一歳、傷大腹及肩、尚在療治中、</p>

<p>二一枝譚</p>
<p>小序</p>
<p>— 庭</p>
<p>翻出西堂雜俎，恰見一種隨筆，呌做「五九枝譚」，這便激起我的好奇性·</p>
<p>西堂雜俎不是尤西堂先生的著作麽？尤老先生不是清初的博學鴻詞麽？他老人家不是劉伯温，怎會未卜先知，預料到數百年後有五九國恥這麽一回事，他在標題上面，竟標出這五九兩個字來！</p>
<p>後來，仔細看他的序言，才知道他的五九，是另有一個五九，他動筆的時候，是在冬至到年底這一段時候，俗語說的「連冬起九」，冬至到年底，恰是五個九，所以呌做「五九枝譚」·</p>
<p>我這不倫不類又枝又蔓的談話，也想喚做五九枝譚，表示我受了國恥的刺激以後的著述；但是，這個名詞，被他老人家佔了優先權去，我便不得不改換名稱呌做「二一枝譚」·</p>
<p>二一和五九，一般是紀念國恥；二十一條的無理要求，便是五月九日的二十一條創痕，我的「二一枝譚」，便是「五九枝譚」·</p>
<p>再者，我動筆的一年，恰是中華民國二十一年；這一年，正是淞滬血戰的一年，又值得我作爲篇名的紀念·</p>
<p>末了，我掛一副自嘲的對聯：</p>
<p>讀西堂雜俎，　作東施效顰·</p>
<h3>老人内閣</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>日本新閣齋藤總理以次十二人。其年齡最少者農林後藤。猶四十九歲。最高者高橋大藏。七十九歲。其餘皆五六七十以外。統計之爲七百四十八歲。可謂老氣横秋矣。此次政變。起於青年。不惜冒險。以手槍炸彈從事。乃結果不能成立青年内閣。反炸出一批老人。良覺有趣。</p>
<p>吾國秦穆公信用孟明（新派）違拒蹇叔。（老派）喪師於　。作秦誓悔過。孔子删存於尚書。經也。黄髮元良。所謂元老。經之影響於歷代。用人行政。偏嚮老成。按格停年。罕見黑頭宰相。馴至前清。昏耄當朝。以亡其國。物窮則變。近卅年來。崇尚青年。公認爲國之主人。迨北伐革命。可稱青年極盛時代。亦即老輩倒霉時代。諡之以落伍。擬之以活埋。老朽昏庸。字必聯綴。如定律焉。其實老少得失。難可遽斷。試觀外國。當道領袖。何嘗是年少翩翩。甚至法官尚老。假裝白髮。一九一四年之戰。其大將年齡。如興登堡。如沙格羅夫。如霞飛。如福煦。如麥耿生等。無不七十而弱。五六十而强。何老人之不易推翻歟。</p>
<p>因思功名之路。特達幾人。大抵才屬天生。學識人力。備嘗艱險。盡知情僞。知名於世。已到中年。政治進化。爲蛻脫式。爲螺旋式。新之與舊。老之與少。斷非如一刀截筍。兩段斬齊。在老者固宏經騐。而第涉暮氣。青年固多朝氣。而難饜羣望。於是相摩相盪。相反相成。固無不倒之翁。亦絕少甘羅之相。即如齋藤輩今日之老者。即前日之青年。其青年時。對於前之老人不滿。思欲取而代之。其奮鬥也。螺而旋之。蛻而脫之。迨其袞袞登臺。則已番番黄髮矣。今之青年者。即後日之齋藤。此時正不知不覺。在蛻脫螺旋式中。依齋藤之樣而畫胡蘆也。</p>
<h3>肥人譚</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>人多以體肥爲苦，而土耳其斯丹波有肥人會。其會長阿禮福等。轉以增其體肥是蘄。會中現有會員一百五十人。今夏擬漫游全歐會員數人。以體肥猶不足動倫敦巴黎柏林人士之觀瞻。兹方竭力加餐。冀於啓程之前。增加體重數磅。會長阿禮福某日語路透訪員曰。「余體重僅二十三斯通。（每斯通合英國十四磅。二十三斯通合三百二十二磅。）至以爲戚。余亟望能增至二十五斯通。則克享獲肥人樂園中之福澤矣。」言至此。眉飛色舞。</p>
<p>大足表其志向之殷切。又曰。「余於飲食。選擇至精。余已罄魚肝油十二打。及用同量之蛋黄注射於體。冀在今夏達余所望。而後首途。作長游焉。肥人會會員中無一女子。蓋會員雖力圖體肥。而土國婦女則渴望者。身段苗條。腰肢細柔。故居恒以跳舞網球散步爲樂。婦女之嬌弱者。向多倚枕消閒。今亦昻步街市。俾體益瘦削。而愈見嫵媚。</p>
<p>前述之肥人會會長。體重僅廿三斯通。若以與美國綠杉磯之肥人名哈里者較。則如小巫之見大巫矣。哈里年二十有三。身高六呎一寸。重五十六斯通又三十一磅。（合重七百八十七磅。）匪特爲今日世界肥人之王。而能識以來。耳目年見。亦未之聞也。昔英國有肥人藍伯特者。死於一八０九年。重僅七百三十九磅。又今寗林戲班中之徽爾女士。重亦不過六百三十磅。第在世界肥女中殆爲巨擘。</p>
<p>今有人焉。同器而食。食又同量。乃一肥一癯。何歟。推原其故。乃由腦根頭顱之底。有一軟腺，血液巡環過之。但無管與通。故爲一無管腺專名爲分泌黏液腺。因舊說口中之涎。出自此腺也。此腺之細膜内製成一種精液。其有關人身。視舌上任何液體爲巨。此腺分泌物之吸入血中者。司軀體之增長。並調節食物消化後所變之質量。當其動作恰當時。能容適量之脂肪。積於皮膚之下。而使吾人肌肉豐滿。若此腺動作逾度。則脂肪爲體中之熱與力燒盡。斯人縱食不絕口。而仍不免骨立焉。若此腺動作遲鈍。則脂肪不被焚。而將厚積於皮膚之下。此哈里所以痴肥也。彼縱減食至弱不可支。而其所進些須。亦化爲脂肪。留而不亡。故即終日運動。至於極度。或不時忍飢。其體重七百八十七磅。亦不過減輕數磅耳。</p>
<h3>中外力士角力記</h3>
<p>— 征鴻</p>
<p>有西人Ｋ氏者。自謂着手能舉重四百十磅。爲歐洲著名之體育家。Ｋ創氏體育校於滬西某路。與蝸居相距僅百步。然余未嘗入内一窺究竟也。上星期日。友人王君走告余。謂渠將隨中國之少年力士某君赴Ｋ校與歐洲力士角力。今且在門外矣。余聆言欣然從之出。因介見某君。覘其狀貌。特一翩翩年少耳。初不知其身懷絕技也。旣達目的地。入門即覩歐洲力士之小影。張壁間殆遍。身雄體偉。以視某君之纖羽。勢若不敵。旣抵體育室。陳科學化之健身器械凡數十種。類不能道其名。三時許。觀衆絡繹至。乃由舌人縷述其校之設備如何美善。校長之技術如何神勇。語多矜誇。不復贅。及至公開表演。先由另一力士演雙槓畢。繼乃播弄一鐵錘重數十磅。上下抛擲。輕若彈丸。至是舌人語觀衆。謂「東亞健兒。不妨一試。」然衆皆咋舌摇首。無敢應者。遂中Ｋ氏一獻其絕技。先以兩手據雙槓上。曲而未伸。兩足横承以板。而四肢已騰空矣。乃由兩人以百廿磅之鐵磴。懸於頸間。Ｋ氏乃延頸引磴。漸漸而起。臂直如矢。而掌聲已若雷鳴矣。先是該校遍登各報廣告。謂有人能作Ｋ氏之同樣表演者。酬五百金。舌人復以是語告觀衆。而此中華力士乃應聲而起。自以磴懸頸間。一躍而登。表演一如Ｋ氏。觀衆乃附掌歡呼。僉謂足令東方病夫揚眉吐氣也。然此五百金之懸賞。竟以託詞姿勢不合而爽約。觀衆咸不直所爲。顧某君之目的。初不在阿堵物。遂亦一笑置之。及告散會。衆皆離座起。Ｋ氏復以預置塲中之鐵質舉重器（約重二百餘磅華人稱爲仙人擔）顧視某君。意將與之一較實力。某君頷之。Ｋ氏乃前執器。先承以腹。繼以肩。終乃越頂而伸。凡三挫焉。某君乃摳衣引臂。一舉而起。復昻之使高。仰之使下。凡十餘次而罷。觀衆大呼中華健兒萬歲。回顧歐西力士。皆瞠目結舌。逡巡而遁。衆乃一哄散。舌人趨執某君手。詢以姓氏。某君笑曰。余病夫國之一病夫耳。何問爲。</p>
<h3>記墨廬書刻</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>昔人以桃核作記。讀之輒爲神往。初未敢信琢者之技之工。一至於斯也。焉有以方寸之地。得網羅山水人物而復窮狀其神貌畢肖者哉。然見吾友賴子墨廬之琱鑱造化。刻畫雲烟。迺信古之人不予欺也識墨廬未朞年。視其形行。有習於紈袴子弟者。未嘗以金石相研質。殆造糞翁之居。數數見之。知其善讀撝叔蒼石印譜。瀏覽鐘鼎瓦璫遺籀。偶吐評語往往中肯。始奇其人。今年春。墨廬忽以便面一方見貽大不盈尺。上書離騷賦。細如針刺。歛於芥末。鏡以顯微。神形不爽。於是知眞敏慧者固不能以貌取之也。遂以其扇。付海上閒鷗。請繪螺殻道場圖。同屬工細之作。克兼兩美者。是可寳也。墨廬又能鐫象牙竹骨。或書或畫。各極其致。貽吾片牙。刻板橋老人道情全文。而字字皆妙。無肥瘦之判。蓋已神乎其技矣。然墨廬每當酒酣。横筆作劈窠字。骨以顔柳。體以籀艸。亦復蒼遒奪目。餘子無與比倫。王西神先生曰。若論賴子之才氣。洵不媿夫李廣之無雙。揆厥品題。亦豈屑居温嶠之第二。鄭虔傳稱三絕。柳渾才敵十人。例之古人。豈多讓哉。吾於墨廬亦如是云。</p>
<h3>廉儉救國說（一）</h3>
<p>— 聶曾紀芬述男其杰撰文</p>
<p>家慈慨社會之奢靡。爰述先訓。貢獻當世。蓋國奢則示之以儉之意。其杰以爲此乃關係世界治亂安否之大題。因請於家慈。俾廣其說。乃陳述古今中外成敗得失之故。證之以事效。不覺冗長其詞。且推崇古義而薄今說。懼觸時忌。或將引起非難。望讀者分别觀之。苟措詞失當。而引證有誤者。知皆其杰之咎也。再其杰久病。不耐搆思。力疾作此。多所疏漏。閱者幸教而正之。　聶其杰謹識</p>
<p>歷觀數千年治亂盛衰之迹。與一時風尚之奢儉爲消息。大抵社會奢侈。則縱欲肆志之表現也。風俗儉樸。即克已復禮之表現也。縱欲望即殺機動而亂至矣。崇禮義即生機萌而治隆矣。其消息甚微。而徵諸事實證騐。未有或爽者也。就一身所閱歷。亦有可述者。余生值咸豐初年。粤亂初起。先文正公赤手空拳。出膺艱鉅。時值承平日久。朝野酣嬉。習於虚僞。軍事吏治。腐敗已極。無可撥之餉。無一可戰之兵。先公初以鄕紳任團練。後則總制各省軍務。統兵至十餘萬。以廉率屬。以儉治家。誓不以軍中一錢寄家用。竟能造爲風氣。一時將吏皆以道義廉潔相勉循。故能和衷共濟。戡定大難。一二在上位者克已制欲。而其成效有如此者。先公在軍時。先母居鄕。手中竟無零錢可用。拮据情形。至爲他人所不諒。以爲督撫大帥之家。不應窘乏若此。其時鄕間有言。修善堂殺一猪之油。止能供三日之食。黄金堂殺一鷄之油。亦須作三日之用。修善堂者。先叔澄侯公所居。因辦理鄕團公事客多。飯常數桌。黄金堂則先母所居之宅也。即此數語。可想見當時先母節儉之情形矣。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（六八）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第八回　無邊哀怨懺情中難期曠達　極度聲歌行樂裹得覩威嚴</p>
<p>那毛德順初一到的時候郤勤務很多。從一個手提包内。取出許多珍奇的物件。如銀茶壺，銀托玻璃盃，金香烟盒·金框小鏡子·金粉盒之類。全搬到前面那鋪看白檯布擺着四色乾濕高裝碟子的架兒上。恍似開了個小小博覽會。隨又呌茶房泡茶。親自劃洋火遞香烟。等太太們品茶吸烟顧盼自如很舒齊了以後。才跳到後面高層上來。坐在安玉田身畔。附着耳朶伸出手指那麽說道。現在還只八點多鐘。我們大帥果然早就來了。你瞧。那正中包訂坐着的就是。旁邊陪他的人還不多。戲台上也還没上好戲。不如這就領你去罷。安玉田順着小毛的指頭遥遥睇視。果認得那裏有個頭戴瓜皮緞帽當中綴着一塊五色寳星和一粒大冬珠而縮做一團嬉反笑臉的小鬍子。與平日在報上所見的葉作章影像一般無二。正思忖着事到臨頭。應如何放大方些上塲去應付這一幕也含有戲劇性的表演。郤不料小毛已向五太太打好了交代。猛不防的拉了他便走。再要從容籌措。已來不及。暗暗揑着一把汗。和抓緊了一顆摇盪的心。隨小毛踉蹌着到了葉作章的包訂門側。由小毛先進去通禀。葉作章點頭說了一聲請。還居然把他。猴兒般矮小身體立了起來。對着安玉田現出滿臉縐紋的微笑。安玉田趕忙踏進包廂。戰戰兢兢的鞠了三個躬。葉作章又將手一擺。請他到前面來坐以便說話。安玉田緊記着閨中的訓教。力戒畏葸。大踏步也便要跨到前頭椅子中去。不想心神究是恍惚。竟忘記了包庭中原有兩級階段。從高處猛一踏下。非同平地。就幾乎失了脚似踹在深坑裏一樣。眼見得便要跌倒在那椅子堆裏。畢竟當塲能免出醜失儀不能。且看下回寫出。</p>

<h3>賊出關門</h3>
<p>— 劍華</p>
<p>「賊出關門」是一句俗諺，就是說人在事前，不能預防，臨時不能消弭，只能在事後張皇補救，所以效力很小，但是自古以來，這種「賊出關門」的先例，不知做出了多少，你以爲他們都是笨伯嗎？他們雖然不能防止第一次賊的光臨，然在受創以後，加上一種關門的防禦工作，至少可减少第二次第三次：：：賊來的可能，所謂「亡羊補牢」，所謂「補偏救弊」，也無非是賊出關門的意思　　現在的人，尤其我們貴國的人，恐怕已經進化到極點了，賊不來自然是「四門大開」，賊來了便「開門揖盜」，賊走了「門雖設而不關」，</p>
<p>例如去年漢口的大水，事前要是稍爲防備一點，總不致演成那樣空前的慘象，水來了，也只有手忙脚亂，任其洶湧衝盪，束手無策，水退了我們總以爲多少總要做一點「關門」的防禦工程，但是聰明的中國人，以爲這是庸人自擾，大水是不會再來的，誰知不客氣的大水，現在又恐要光臨了，這種事例很多，我也不必舉了，唉！</p>

<h3>自製各種橡皮物</h3>
<p>— 乃徵</p>
<p>自一八三九年故德易牙（NelsonGoodyear）發明加硫法（Vutcanixe）後，橡皮的功用，更爲進步。今一國用橡皮的數量愈多，即可證明其工業愈發達，蓋橡皮爲佔工業中之極重要地位，今橡皮在我國非常須要，所以特來介紹。</p>
<p>（一）橡皮的來源</p>
<p>簡單的說，橡皮是從一種植物的軀幹裹面流出來的膠汁，故亦稱樹膠。至於生長橡皮植物地帶，僅限於南緯三十度至北緯三十度之間，因爲橡皮樹生長的要件，必須温暖氣候。</p>
<p>（二）橡皮的分類</p>
<p>生橡皮丨是南洋羣島與印度等所植的橡皮樹的膠汁，土人把樹體上割成Ｖ字形，下面接承一只桶，膠汁流在裹面。後來凝結成固體，變成料狀或塊狀。　　生硬橡皮丨是新嘉坡等處所産的橡皮樹的膠汁。從樹内流出後，凝結成硬質，但是浸在在熱水内可以變軟，能隨意揑成各種式樣的。</p>
<p>硫橡皮丨是一種生橡皮製成的物品，再用加硫法使牠含硫。牠能伸縮而有彈性，不像生橡皮遇著冷要變硬而收縮，遇到熱要變軟而黏粘，所以牠的用途最多，如摩托車的車胎，醫藥用的器具，機輪上的轉帶，電綫的包皮，橡皮雨衣鞋子等，都是這一類橡皮。</p>
<p>重硫橡皮丨是一種含多量硫黄的，用較高温度長時間加熱的橡皮。牠失去彈性，變成角質，對於電氣爲良好的絕緣體。牠的主要用途就是造電氣器具，並且牠非常的光澤美麗，不受各種藥品侵蝕，所以牠能製造裝飾品與各種用具是很好的。</p>
<p>（三）橡皮的製造</p>
<p>橡皮糊丨製造橡皮糊，亦屬於橡皮工業的一科，有多數工廠，專門製造此物。製法，先將橡皮混合各物，然後投入器内攪拌，製成糊漿，裝在罐内發售。方子，橡皮管修理糊，伯拉橡皮二磅半　偏蘇里　半加侖　松樹油　半品脫　哥羅地恩　半品脫（小試騐可以照此比例减小）。用途，可修補車胎氣管水袋等，又可塗補橡皮防水布。</p>
<p>橡皮管丨製法，將哥羅仿半品脫置於大口的玻璃瓶内，加入切碎的生橡皮四英兩，用塞子塞好，等十幾分鐘，橡皮溶化了，變成淡椶色的膠液，然後倒入一口封密，直徑輕較大的長玻璃管内，再拿圓玻璃梗揷進去，即拔出，則玻璃梗外面黏着一層薄膠，現在必須掛在通風的地方吹乾，使哥羅仿化散，而後再像前法揷入料内，則又有一層黏著，再晾乾，這樣經過幾次後，到需要的厚薄爲止，末了把玻璃梗抽出，橡皮管就成功，再拿另一個長玻璃管，一口亦封緊，傾二硫化炭（CarbouBisnldphie）五十分氯化硫（SulphurChloride）一分（以上二物不能吸入肺中）入内，使混合和匀，將已成的橡皮管揷入，等三四秒鐘，就要拿出來，則管已收硫而成硫橡皮管，碰著冷熱不會起變化了；但是管薄的，揷入加硫劑内，不能過三四秒鐘，否則管溶化而不見，倘使管厚些，則可稍爲多浸幾秒鐘。牠的用途很廣，醫藥上的器具，理化用器具，都要配上橡皮管的。</p>

<h3>眼前的事</h3>
<p>— 榖梁</p>
<p>一個小夥計的口述</p>
<p>「你是知道的，我在ＸＸ棉布字號做個小夥計，我們店裏的營業，十分之六是ＸＸ貨，十分之三是西洋貨，國貨只占到一分！從去年東北事起，營業也一落千丈，那時候，抵制熱度，正在沸點，所謂「檢查貨」也非常起勁，以後也就不敢再進，同時國貨雖覺暢銷，但因我號與國貨廠家，向來不大發生關係，定貨當然無着，只好愁眉不展地虚度光隂，後來上海打仗，接着罷市，生意完全斷絕，那時我們夥計淘，深恨經理向不注重提倡國貨，以致一旦事起，束手無策，但我們終是「悉聽驅策」的小夥計，平時縱有什麽意見，也無敢向「南面王」似地經理發表，因爲根本没有資格啊！：：：停戰協定簽字之後，人心都已鬆懈，而且Ｘ貨已續有鉅額進口，所以經理先生又覺得「英雄有用武之地」了，當然接洽之後，辦進了數十箱，以後是不用說，照中國的習慣，我們小夥計的「生活父母」就是大經理，一切都要仰仗他「高抬貴手」的，尤其在此「國難裁員」當中，動不動有飯碗被摔的危險，誰敢不懔懔慄慄，努力從公呢？不過我們都是中國人，我雖是個小夥計，並不敢忘「匹夫有責」的話，在這個境地當中，你想呌我怎麽做才好」？</p>
<p>這一件事，並非虚搆，乃是眼前的事實，而且這家布號的一個股東，我是知道的，他是一個值得佩服的，努力於實際工作的救國者，并有聲於時丨一店營業，權有經理，只要賺錢，股東大約是不願過問的，但我們在這種地方，就覺到做一樁事情，要言行澈底，的確很難，要挽回福國的頽運，眞不是一樁不可輕易的事，</p>

<p>社會的一角</p>
<h3>異樣的情緒</h3>
<p>— 烟雨</p>
<p>是不多幾天以前一個早晨的事，暮春的急雨，浸潤着上海都市中的每一條馬路，各種車輛，在雨中行駛，宛如一羣落湯雞一樣狼狽，我在圓明圓路學校裏上完了兩課之後，便匆匆地跑到北京路外灘，跳上一輛駛往楊楊浦的八路電車，三等車廂裏的乘客，擁擠得不成樣子，便是頭等車廂内，也祇剩了一個空座位，當時，我便不客氣地把它佔據了，</p>
<p>大概是在篷路那一站吧，電車停下來了，車廂裏的乘客，誰都没有做出一點想要下車的動作，無疑的，他們正像我一樣，還没有到達目的地哩，然而，一個年輕的某國女郎，却在這時候跳上了軍車，當她拖着木屐，跑進了車廂以後，她的目光接着就向四週掃射了一轉，立刻可以發覺的，空座位是一個也不剩了，她一隻手握着一頂淋透的油紙雨傘，另一隻手裏是錢袋，很侷促的，她便靠着跑進來的門邊站住了，隨着打開了錢袋，數銅子給那賣票人，電車在雨中駛行，顚摇得格外利害，當車子駛下外虹橋的時候，車身向前仰着，她身子一側，險一些兒跌倒下來，爲的是她正在錢袋裏拿銅子，没有把上面籐圈抓住，</p>
<p>整個車廂裏的乘客，無不把視線集中在她身上，顯然的，她更怩忸不安了，一層由淺而深的少女們特有的紅暈，籠罩了她的面部，她的眼睛，却很無意義地注視着車廂外面玻璃窗上的雨滴，</p>
<p>照理，像我們受過大學教育的洗禮的青年，决不應該坐視着一個女性彷徨爲難，而束手旁觀的，在這時候，我應該馬上站起來，把自已的座位讓給她坐才對，這些，都是所謂文明人的禮貌，可是眼前站着的女郎，在最近的過去中，我差不多見了便生氣，不論是男女老幼，一樣的使我惱恨，我不願意，再對這般殘酷的民族，表示什麽禮貌，</p>
<p>電車已到提籃橋，有幾位乘客跳下車去了，坐在那鄰國姑娘身邊的一個西洋婦人，便招手喚她坐下，同時馬路上一陣軋軋的機器脚踏車聲，吸引了衆座客的目光，十幾個敵人的陸軍，魚貫着向楊樹浦方面疾駛而去，頓時這姑娘的臉上，呈現出自然的微笑，再過去一站路，我跳下了電車，一路歸家，心裏充滿着一種異樣的情緖，</p>

<h3>西部戰綫平靜無事</h3>
<p>— 老湯</p>
<p>通常，（除了旁邊站着先生的時候）晚上的自修室是我們（包括男女兩生）的「談話室」和「辯論會」。</p>
<p>今晚，「男女霸權問題」做了我們辯論的中心，原因是最愛自誇的「方喇叭」，在看了璇宫艶史後大吹其牛，以致點着了大辯論的導火線。</p>
<p>這裏，對立着兩個陣線，當然，一方面是勇於說大話的「英雄」們，另一方面是不甘示弱的「英雌」</p>
<p>「我們男子是執着世界的霸權，璇宫艶史中的女王便是女子屈服於男子的好榜樣」。「方喇叭」大聲地宣佈他今天看過璇宫艶史。</p>
<p>「如何見得？璇宫艶史不過是一部影片，不是事實丨」常在運動塲出風頭的李女士口中呌出第一聲反抗的呼喊。</p>
<p>中了舊禮教之毒的書憨子蔣羅博，（别字醬蘿葡）加入協約方面，和方喇叭聯成一條戰綫；「非也，非也，你們念過「夫者天也」的千古不磨的名言嗎？夫「夫」者，男子之謂也」。他大摇其儍頭，大擺其儍腦，以致自修室中酸氣冲天「紀元前五千年的腦子！」張女士擺出日前在辯論會上表現過的姿勢：「我們是現代人，不是古人，現代的人應當說現代話，以現代的事實做前提。」</p>
<p>有馬永貞第二之稱的山東人馬家俊，擺出「拳打江浙兩省」的架子翹起一個大拇指，聲若洪鐘地說；「現代的發明家有女的嗎？現代的政治領袖有女的嗎？屋角裏的趙女士抱了「兵來將擋水來土掩」的宗旨，大聲的說，「蘇聯有女大使，我國的國民會議席上也不是有三個女同志嗎？你：：：」話還没完，門口出現了舍監先生，於是全自修室沉寂了，男生們喜歡得眉花眼笑，女生們氣得低頭無語。</p>
<p>舍監先生走過了門口，門外忽然飄進一個聲浪；「西部戰綫，平靜無事！」接着門口伸進一個剃和尚頭的腦袋來，一看之下，原來是着名的捉狹鬼「王八蛋」</p>
<h3>生意經</h3>
<p>— 鳴志</p>
<p>大减價的旗幟下面：買一尺放一尺的標語，有的不時髦了：於是替代而興的，便有「足尺加十」「市尺加十」種種新名詞。在另一方面，那「足尺加二」「市足加三」的老調，却又給他們改做「購買一丈奉贈三尺」，或購買二丈另送四尺的新詞：這不能不佩服人們的善翻花樣哪！</p>
<p>便宜菜，經濟菜，五角一餐，六角一頓的，飯館裏有得售，點心店裏有得售，大菜館裏也有得售；現在，並且酒店裏也有得售了，最近的將來，也許茶館裏也有得售的。人們吃飯的研究，是越弄越精明；他們營業的方法，也就隨着愈趨愈進化了。</p>

<h3>Further Elucidation on the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union, by Bin</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper proposed the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, there has been considerable support from society, as well as considerable opposition. On the 31st of last month, Mr. Xu Bai published a commentary in the Da Wan Bao, titled "Further Discussion on Restoring Diplomatic Relations with Russia and a Response to Mr. Bin of Shen Bao," raising several questions about the issue of restoration. While these reflect different perspectives and opinions, such debates are of great significance. Therefore, I would like to further elaborate on the points raised.</p>
<p>Regarding the inseparability of restoring diplomatic relations, allying with the Soviet Union, and tolerating the Communists, and the fact that China's current state is most suitable for the growth of Communism, without the establishment of a strong government, the organization of a strict society, and the stability of the people's livelihood, it is impossible to prevent the growth and spread of Communism – Mr. Xu Bai has already expressed agreement on these points, so there is no need to discuss them further here. However, the two questions Mr. Xu Bai raised at the end – "Why did we break off diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia in the first place?" and "Has the advocacy for restoring diplomatic relations now resolved these conditions?" – are of utmost importance, and perhaps they are questions shared by the majority of people. If these two questions cannot be answered, then our proposal for restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union would indeed be a preposterous theory that disregards the facts. But is that really the case?</p>
<p>In 1927, when our country severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the government's stated reason was that "Soviet Russia instigated and participated in Communist rebellions, sabotaging the National Revolution, and drastic measures had to be taken." In 1929, the Sino-Soviet conflict over the Chinese Eastern Railway was, as the Ta Kung Pao put it, "also something that should not have happened in the first place" (see the editorial "Further Discussion on Restoring Diplomatic Relations with Russia" on May 19th). However, the increasing rampant influence of the Communist Party in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Fujian has occurred after the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. In the Northeast, consular relations were maintained with the Soviet Union even after 1927. However, the influence of the Communist Party in the Northeast is not as great as in the South. Therefore, we cannot but admit that the policy of preventing the Communist Party by severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union has completely failed. Therefore, it can be said that severing diplomatic relations was against the Soviet Union, but not to prevent Communism. The fact is that severing diplomatic relations has not been able to prevent Communism.</p>
<p>As for the question of "Has the advocacy for restoring diplomatic relations now resolved these conditions?", it can also be answered without much elaboration. In 1927, the British Conservative Party cabinet made a mountain out of a molehill and severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union under the pretext of the so-called "Arcos raid." When the British Labour Party regained power in 1929, it immediately restored diplomatic relations. Was it that the Conservative Party cabinet had no way to prevent the propaganda of "Redization," and the Labour Party cabinet had no scruples? Conversely, did the Conservative Party cabinet's severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union truly eliminate the propaganda of British Communism? Therefore, we say that severing diplomatic relations is against the Soviet Union, but not to prevent Communism. This is an inevitable truth.</p>
<p>If one were to say that because diplomatic relations were severed in the past, they should not be restored today, it would be a "mechanistic" view. Diplomacy should only consider whether it is currently beneficial or not, and should not rigidly adhere to the status quo. Today, in terms of the international situation, restoring diplomatic relations is beneficial to us, as we have said before. Furthermore, in terms of international trade, our trade with European, American, and Japanese countries has always been in deficit, while only with the Soviet Union has it been in surplus. After the severance of diplomatic relations, our tea and fur industries have suffered greatly. If diplomatic relations are restored today, it should also be beneficial to us in terms of trade. Although the Soviet Union has been vigorously implementing a "dumping policy" in recent years, if the goods it sells are indeed low in price, it is still harmless to us. Moreover, in recent years, the Soviet Union has also changed its aggressive foreign policy to a defensive policy, due to its focus on the Five-Year Plan. This is also a very obvious fact. If one insists that because diplomatic relations were severed with the Soviet Union in the past, they cannot be restored today, then our country should never be able to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in the future. Is this truly beneficial to us?</p>
<p>In conclusion, we believe that in terms of the international situation and the relationship between China and the Soviet Union, it is beneficial for our country to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. As for preventing Communism, it lies in improving domestic politics and stabilizing the people's livelihood. Mr. Xu Bai also agrees with this opinion. Severing diplomatic relations only creates enemies and cannot prevent the spread of Communism.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to reliable sources, the crisis involving the reorganization of the navy and air force in the Southwest is still being mediated by various committees in Guangdong. It is reported that Chen Ce has proposed the following four conditions: 1. After the navy is reorganized and placed under the Eighth Route Army command, he will continue to serve as its commander. 2. After being reinstated as commander, he will not go to the province but will send a representative to handle daily affairs. 3. Hainan Island will be designated as a pacification zone, with the Southwest Political Affairs Committee allocating 1 million yuan in pacification funds each month. 4. The naval infantry will be permanently stationed on Hainan Island and will not be transferred to the province. Chen Jitang has expressed acceptance of the second condition, but has not agreed to the first, third, and fourth conditions, so the prospects remain bleak. Furthermore, the more than 100 aircraft recently donated by overseas Chinese were intended for resisting Japan and saving the nation and will not participate in any civil wars. Because the situation in the Southwest is still tense, the aircraft will remain in the United States and will not be shipped for the time being. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<h3>Luo Wengan Talks About Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Continues to be Responsible for Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 3rd, a reporter visited Foreign Minister Luo and inquired about recent diplomatic issues. He was received and replied as follows: "The Japanese marines in Shanghai have failed to withdraw to their original defenses before January 28 as agreed, and our committee members of the Joint Committee have been conducting negotiations. The rapid withdrawal of the Japanese army this time has exceeded the scheduled timetable in the ceasefire agreement, so the marines should of course also withdraw in accordance with the spirit of the agreement. This matter can be resolved by the Joint Committee and is not a problem. The crux of the Sino-Japanese dispute lies in the Northeast issue. The Northeast issue is the cause of the Sino-Japanese dispute, while the Shanghai issue is its consequence. The investigation team is currently in the Northeast to conduct an investigation, which has been completed, and will depart from Shenyang to Beiping on the 4th to compile a report. The next three months, approximately six, seven, and eight, will be the period for compiling the report. In September, the League of Nations will convene a meeting to discuss the report and seek a solution. However, the ability of the League of Nations to demonstrate its ability to deal with Sino-Japanese issues in the past, and the extent to which Japan can obey the League of Nations' resolutions, should be known to the Chinese people. Therefore, whether the League of Nations can achieve a satisfactory resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute this time is a major question. It is better to rely on oneself than to rely on others. Our way out lies in sincere unity and the full expression of the nation's spirit and strength. The impression gained by the investigation team during its visit to the Northeast was quite good, and they were able to express their sympathy for us. Japan is the stronger party and the aggressor, while we are the weaker party and the victim of aggression. The facts are all there, and justice is clear. Even if the team wanted to not express sympathy for us, it would be impossible. However, sympathy is one thing, and whether the Sino-Japanese dispute can be satisfactorily resolved because of this sympathy is another matter. Therefore, we should not be complacent and satisfied because of this sympathy. As for the talk of a round table conference, and even the claim that the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and other countries have agreed to Japan's proposal to convene such a conference, it is purely one-sided propaganda by the Japanese side. Although our country does not object in principle to convening an international conference to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, we will absolutely not agree to a conference that only discusses the issue of security in Shanghai. The issue of restoring diplomatic relations between China and Russia is of utmost importance. The central government must, of course, weigh the pros and cons and make detailed and careful considerations. If the Russian side can be sincere, restoration is not impossible. Regarding the expenses of embassies and consulates, there were previously huge arrears. After I took office as Foreign Minister, although I tried my best to save internal expenses, the expenses of the embassies and consulates that were received were fully disbursed, accounting for 30% in the first month, 50% in the second month, and 100% in the third month. Currently, negotiations are underway with the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Song also knows the importance of embassies and consulates and promises to do his best to allocate funds. Once the funding issue is resolved, the supplementation and reorganization of personnel will, of course, continue. After the reorganization, the monthly expenses of embassies and consulates can be saved by about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Ambassador Jiang stationed in Japan and Ambassador Guo stationed in the United Kingdom will leave for their posts in the next few days. The mouthpiece of diplomacy will become healthier day by day." It is said that Foreign Minister Luo took office during the outbreak of the Shanghai war, enduring great difficulties and making efforts to mediate. Moreover, as the former Minister of Justice Administration, his duties were heavy, and he repeatedly petitioned the central government to resign from the concurrent position of Foreign Minister. Now, after the central government's earnest retention, he has decided to continue to be responsible. (Telegram from the 3rd, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Health Holds Opium Suppression Commemoration Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The June 3rd Opium Suppression Commemoration Ceremony was held at the Ministry of Health. Liu Ruiheng delivered a speech, stating that the harm of opium is known to all. Although prohibitions have been issued many times, the effectiveness has been minimal. Recently, opium suppression in various provinces has become even more lax. The matter of opium suppression is related to military affairs and finance, making it extremely complicated. The Ministry can only issue prohibitions through announcements, and the difficulties are not fully understood by all sectors. There have even been criticisms directed at individuals. The Ministry has found that the annual opium suppression method decided by the National Assembly conflicts with current laws and regulations. It has submitted the difficulties in handling the matter to the Executive Yuan for forwarding to the Central Political Conference for review. The speaker has also been personally instructed by President Wang to detail the advantages and disadvantages of both gradual and immediate prohibition methods for reference. However, the effectiveness of opium prohibition depends on whether government orders can reach various provinces. No concrete instructions have been received yet. Faced with the spread of the opium scourge, the Ministry can only implement current laws and regulations in hopes of achieving results. It hopes for guidance and assistance from all sectors at all times. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Special Japanese Diet Meeting: Saito Announces Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Maintaining Diplomatic Relations with Russia, Aggressively Invading China</p>
<p>Seeking to Promote a Round Table Conference to Resolve the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>Determined to Take Concrete Steps to Annex Our Northeast</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd - This morning, the 62nd session of the Japanese Diet convened. Prime Minister Saito attended the meeting and announced the new cabinet's foreign policy as follows:</p>
<p>I take this opportunity to briefly describe the recent developments in our country's foreign relations. Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement on May 5th in the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai, the Shanghai area has quickly returned to a state of peace, which is gratifying. During the negotiation of this agreement, various difficulties arose. Fortunately, the British Minister to China and representatives of other friendly countries worked hard to mediate, and our attitude of fairness and integrity led to a satisfactory outcome. This is what I should mention. I also take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the army and navy officers and soldiers who fought bravely in Shanghai. The terms of the agreement stipulate that the Chinese army should remain in a place several miles away from Shanghai and should cease all hostilities. If any action of the Chinese army is sufficient to cause panic, representatives of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy will investigate the truth. If these conditions are observed for a long time, the Chinese army in the Shanghai area does not seem to cause new riots, at least temporarily to avoid this. For this reason, the government has decided to recall all the army in the Shanghai area, relying on the implementation of the agreement and the actions taken by various friendly countries to guarantee Shanghai's permanent peace. I dare to decide that the complete withdrawal of troops is sufficient to show the government's repeated declarations of sincerity that this dispatch of troops has no political ambitions. However, what has been ordered now is only the condition for the ceasefire between the Chinese and Japanese armies. As for laying the foundation for Shanghai's permanent peace, no plan has been made. Now, what is absolutely necessary, if we must maintain the prosperity of the international commercial city created by decades of peaceful management, we should take other steps that can make the Chinese and foreign people of Shanghai live and work in peace and contentment. If Shanghai can be free from the danger of riots that have occurred frequently in recent times and in the past, it will not only be a blessing for Chinese and foreign residents, but also a blessing for the entire China and all countries related to China. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the round table conference desired by the Japanese government can be convened and brought to a complete success as soon as possible. This is taken into account in the resolution passed by the League of Nations Administrative Council on February 29th, and China has also agreed to it. Manchuria has now established a new country with new political views, and the progress is remarkable. I know that our country is extremely concerned about the future of Manchuria, which is naturally to be expected. I believe that in any international adjustment regarding the so-called Manchurian case, it is no longer possible to ignore the existence of that country. I believe that the sound development of the new country is an important move for the tranquility of the Far East and the restoration of peace and prosperity in Manchuria. However, the strength of the new government is not enough to restore order within the country, and the activities of bandits and lawbreakers who are often encouraged by the outside world are also difficult to quell. Because of this situation, the Japanese army in Manchuria has had to expand its necessary cooperation, fulfill its responsibility to protect the new government, and prevent unexpected events that endanger the lives and property of our people or cause large-scale riots. The lives of the soldiers and police serving in Manchuria are in danger every day, which we should deeply appreciate. Judging from the history of other countries, whenever political changes like those that have recently occurred in Manchuria occur, there will inevitably be activities of those who are disappointed and those who break the law, even without external encouragement. If so, the government agencies of the new country must take years to fully stabilize. I am extremely opposed to proceeding hastily with the Manchurian Incident. Time is necessary to seek an appropriate solution to the problem. The recent situation in Manchuria has forced the Japanese army to suppress Chinese bandits in North Manchuria in order to protect the Japanese residents there. Our constant respect for Russia's legitimate rights and interests in the area and our efforts to be careful not to infringe them have been clearly expressed in the actions of the Japanese army. Moreover, the Japanese government has repeatedly assured the Russian government that the dispatch of troops to North Manchuria is nothing more than protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents. I feel that although there are rumors outside that Japan and Russia will go to war over the Manchurian case, the Russian government will be able to fully understand our position. I also feel that I should implore the whole country to judge right and wrong in good faith and not be misled by rumors. The League of Nations' close attention to the development of Shanghai is known to you. When the ceasefire negotiations were temporarily frustrated, China raised the matter with the League of Nations, causing disputes. However, the League of Nations, seeing that the Shanghai negotiations could be successful, decided to eliminate the difficulties by means of negotiations in Shanghai. A special meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly was convened on April 30th to pass a resolution requesting the speedy conclusion of the Shanghai negotiations. The Japanese representative had previously protested against the implementation of Article 15 of the League of Nations Charter to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, so he did not vote on the resolution that day. The League of Nations Investigation Team is now conducting an on-site investigation, and we have provided all possible assistance to enable the members to fulfill their duties. I sincerely hope that the delegation will make an accurate and fair judgment on the current situation in China and Manchuria. As for the events of our relations with various countries today, they are issues of international political and economic adjustment. The disarmament conference held in Geneva since February is largely related to this issue. This is the largest conference ever held to discuss general disarmament. The conference will inevitably last a long time. Japan intends to firmly adhere to the points it has put forward as part of its established policy. We sincerely hope that the conference can achieve the desired results for the sake of the world's economy and commerce. In short, there are now major obstacles in the path of international commerce, which is the result of various plans adopted by various countries in an attempt to protect their own industries, which cannot be denied. Japan has done its best to eliminate obstacles to its foreign trade, and has therefore concluded a commercial treaty with Portugal and a tariff treaty with Vietnam. However, the world today is suffering endlessly, of which the recession is the most severe. Many problems can only be resolved by international action, and the future of our country's foreign relations contains great difficulties. Therefore, the whole country should unite more than ever before. To resolve these difficulties, we rely on your assistance and cooperation. I will also do my best to work with you all.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd - Reuters asked Prime Minister Saito about the issue of Russo-Japanese relations. Today, I received a special letter in response, which denied the rumors of extremely tense Russo-Japanese relations, but expressed a sincere hope that Russia would stop sending troops to the Far East and place greater trust in Japan. Russia's dispatch of troops to the Far East is the main cause of unfounded rumors of tense relations between the two countries. As for Russia's proposal to conclude a non-aggression pact, he believes that the conclusion of this pact between the two countries would greatly weaken the strength of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and would be tantamount to establishing a special friendship, which is always resented by various countries. He also said that Russia cannot use its interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway as an excuse to reject Japan's interests in Manchuria. The open-door policy in Manchuria should respect the interests already acquired by all parties, regardless of which country they belong to. Therefore, he does not think Japan should enjoy any interests held by other countries in the Chinese Eastern Railway. The letter also stated several points: (1) Hoping to prevent the situation of Japan withdrawing from the League of Nations; (2) Japan and Manchuria have not discussed a customs union or alliance; (3) The recognition of Manchuria depends on whether that country proves its ability to maintain itself; (4) There is no intention to annex Manchuria. Japan does not want to illegally control the policy of the Manchurian authorities. Saito is scheduled to announce his foreign policy in the Diet tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd - Japanese Prime Minister Viscount Saito announced the government's administrative policy in the Diet today. The main points of his speech are the necessity of eliminating the phenomenon of domestic unrest and maintaining the stability of life. The Prime Minister stated that the economic recession has caused severe hardship in agricultural areas, and urban areas are also feeling the pinch, and the situation is extremely bleak. He said that the government is determined to do its best to maintain peace and order, assist the unemployed, restore the stable living conditions of farm households, and reduce difficulties in the financial sector. He also said that politics should be clarified, and the non-partisan government will ask the two major political parties for support, but it is impartial to both parties. The purpose of the new cabinet is to eradicate the existing malady of the country and realize the wishes of those who demand political reform and win the trust of the people.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd - In the afternoon session of the Diet today, Army Minister Araki expressed his deep regret for the riot committed by the officer cadets in Tokyo on May 15th and condemned the despicable act of assassination, which damaged the prestige of the army. Therefore, he sincerely apologized. The cabinet members attacked Araki's remarks and asked why he did not resign to take responsibility. Araki replied that he had repeatedly thought about it and felt that in this turbulent situation, the best way to serve the emperor was to stay in his position and do his best.</p>
<h3>German Conservative Leader Papen Forms New Cabinet</h3>
<p>With the Nazi Party Agrees to Three Articles to Maintain Power</p>
<p>Deep Rift Between the Center Party and Conservatives</p>
<p>Parliament Decides to Dissolve and Hold New Elections Within Two Months</p>
<p>Foreign Policy Unchanged, Dispelling French Fears</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 2nd - The German cabinet reshuffle came suddenly and stopped suddenly, like a rabbit rising and falling. After President Hindenburg met with the leaders of various factions, he ordered Papen to form a new cabinet on the evening of the 31st.</p>
<h3>New Cabinet Members Sworn In</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 1st - The Papen cabinet was sworn in before the president this afternoon, followed by its first official cabinet meeting. It adjourned shortly after. It is scheduled to hold another cabinet meeting tomorrow afternoon to draft a new cabinet declaration. It is expected that the new cabinet has no intention of dealing with the parliament and will issue a dissolution order in one or two days. The list of new cabinet members is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Papen, Foreign Minister Baron Neurath, Interior Minister Baron Gayl, Defense Minister General Schleicher, Finance Minister Count Krosigk, Justice Minister Gürtner, Agriculture Minister Baron Braun, Transport and Post Minister von Rübenach, Economy and (interim) Labor Minister Warmbold.</p>
<p>This cabinet is composed entirely of conservatives, with most members lacking a strong party affiliation. Papen, originally affiliated with the Catholic Center Party, formally announced his withdrawal from the party after accepting the new mandate to form a cabinet. Papen is a retired military officer who served in the Senate and as a military attaché at the US Embassy before the European War. After the war, he entered politics and was affiliated with the Catholic Center Party. He was elected to the Prussian Parliament three times, but often clashed with party leaders due to his conservatism. Therefore, he did not run for re-election in the recent re-election of the Prussian Parliament. His current cabinet formation is merely a transitional measure for dissolving the parliament and handling the new elections, and to deal with the Lausanne Conference externally. Therefore, his foundation in the current parliament is extremely weak.</p>
<h3>Decided to Order the Dissolution of Parliament</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - Chancellor Papen has decided to avoid the difficulties of dealing with Parliament and will dissolve Parliament immediately after taking office, holding new elections within sixty days in accordance with the constitution. This decision is now believed to be the result of the Catholic Center Party unanimously passing a resolution last night, denouncing the new cabinet as a "stopgap cabinet" that the party cannot tolerate. This resolution not only dashes the party's hopes of remaining neutral, allowing the new Chancellor to gain a majority in Parliament, but its wording will also deepen the rift between the Center Party and the conservatives.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Reuters Telegram) - Observers say that if a general election is held within sixty days, the leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler, will certainly succeed in forming a cabinet. However, according to the current Minister of Defense, the new government will not have a short lifespan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Policy Follows the Policies of the Previous Cabinet</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - Chancellor Papen made a brief statement to the European representative of the National News Agency today regarding the new government's foreign policy. He said, "I have been entrusted by President Hindenburg to form a cabinet. President Hindenburg is the beloved leader of the German people, so I am eager to express my sincere hope to foreign countries through your esteemed agency that I will continue the established policies of my predecessors and work with all friendly nations to enhance friendship. This endeavor will not be relaxed due to the complex domestic affairs of Germany, nor will it be abandoned due to the increasing oppression of Germany by international crises." Papen further stated that he has taken office at a time when there are many possibilities of misfortune. Germany is currently immersed in an economic crisis, the whole country is in turmoil, and the world is affected. Therefore, a major plan must be established in these few weeks to guide the administration for the next few years. He sincerely hopes that all people who sympathize with Germany will unite closely, forget past hatred, and jointly build the foundation for lasting world peace.</p>
<p>Paris, 2nd (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - French celebrity Aristide Briand published an article in "Le Journal," strongly refuting the French media's suspicion that the new German government would be a threat to France, stating that Chancellor Papen is not hostile to France. This can be proven by the fact that Papen once served as a member of the Franco-German Reconciliation Committee. He also said that it would be a great mistake for France to believe that the new German Chancellor could not represent Germany in future international conferences. Papen is a man of outstanding talent and a prominent figure in the conservative party, which has many supporters in Germany today.</p>
<h3>Acknowledging Three Demands of the Nazi Party</h3>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - It has just been learned that the new German Chancellor Papen has agreed to three demands of the National Socialist Party in exchange for the party's support for the new cabinet: (1) to re-elect the parliament; (2) to revoke the ban on the SA (Sturmabteilung, i.e., Brownshirts); (3) to lift censorship and the ban on demonstrations. With this, the party can conduct unrestricted propaganda during the upcoming election campaign.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - German Socialist Party members gathered this morning and unanimously passed a motion of no confidence in the government, but Parliament will be dissolved soon, and this move is merely a formality.</p>
<h3>Brüning Suffers from Heart Disease</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - It has just been learned that former German Chancellor Brüning is suffering from heart disease, and doctors have forbidden him from moving, so he is still residing in the Chancellor's residence. It is said that Brüning's nerves are extremely weak, probably due to overwork and stimulation last week.</p>
<h3>Consolidating National Defense is a Top Priority</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Reuters Telegram) - The new Minister of Defense, Schleicher, told the National Army today, "I will pay attention to consolidating the army, in which our national spirit and strength reside. This is the necessary foundation for our national defense. I will do my best to enable the National Army to protect Germany's borders and safeguard the nation's security." His words were astonishing.</p>
<h3>New French Parliament Established</h3>
<p>Negotiations on forming a cabinet are in progress</p>
<p>Paris, 1st (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - The new French Chamber of Deputies held its inaugural meeting today, electing senior member Gros as chairman. Taittinger and members of the previous cabinet all stepped down to take their seats as deputies. The seats for state ministers were empty. The new government may be formed within this week, although Herriot may not receive the mandate to form a cabinet before Friday. However, it is believed that negotiations between the parties have made sufficient progress. Once Herriot is formally mandated, the list of cabinet members can be announced within forty-eight hours at most.</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Propose Convening an International Economic Conference</h3>
<p>Specifically to discuss monetary issues</p>
<p>Hoping to save falling prices</p>
<p>To be held after the Lausanne Conference</p>
<p>Our country will also be invited to participate</p>
<p>London, 1st (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - Today, British Conservative Party leader Churchill stated that the proposal to convene an international economic conference is one of the most promising things in recent months. It is more important than anything else in today's world, as this conference will bring together major countries to discuss monetary issues in order to save the fall in prices. The Lausanne Conference can now be allowed to consider the reparations issue. As soon as the Lausanne Conference is over, this type of conference must be held immediately, disregarding issues such as tariffs, reparations, and war debts, and focusing on the most important monetary issues. After the monetary issues are resolved, the issues of tariffs, reparations, and war debts will also be affected in the future, and it can be hoped that they will be easier to resolve. As for the silver issue, it will certainly not be excluded from the conference, but he believes that the greatest move is to bring together the leaders of Britain and the United States and invite other countries to participate in jointly discussing strategies to stop the fall in prices, to revitalize world commerce, and to save nations from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Reuters Telegram) - It is reported that the motive for the international conference is due to a recent mention by a senior official in Washington regarding the limitations of the United States' participation in the conference. London then took a further step and began discussions with the United States. At the same time, the countries participating in the Lausanne Conference were also informed in advance. The American, French, and Italian ambassadors to Britain are in constant contact with the British Foreign Office.</p>
<p>Washington, 31st (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - Today, the U.S. State Department has instructed its ambassador to Britain, Mellon, to inform the British government that the United States recognizes that the plan to convene a world economic conference has genuine value for today's depressed economy. However, Secretary of State Stimson solemnly stated that this international economic conference will not discuss events such as war debts, reparations, or disarmament, and the discussion will be limited to purely economic events. British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay had gone to the State Department to inquire whether the United States would participate in an economic conference if it were convened. Therefore, the State Department today instructed Mellon to reply to the British government.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram) - It has just been learned that French Premier Herriot has informed British Foreign Secretary Simon that he fully agrees with the British and American economic conference proposal. It is now expected that China, Japan, South America, the remaining countries in Europe, and the neutral countries during the European War will all be invited to participate.</p>
<h3>Fukuda Died, Shirakawa Cremated</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Dentsu Telegram) - Japanese Army General Fukuda passed away on the morning of the 1st due to a cerebral hemorrhage. During the Russo-Japanese War, Major Fukuda was the first to advocate for war, saying that if Japan went to war with Russia, Japan would surely win. He also had secret talks with Prince Ito and Marshal Yamagata, so at that time, Japanese public opinion leaned towards war. Tokyo, 2nd (Dentsu Telegram) - The remains of General Shirakawa were given a military funeral at the Aoyama Crematorium at 1:00 PM on the 2nd. Official telegram</p>
<p>Telegram from Manila: Addressed to Chairman Lin, President Wang, Chairman Chiang, Mr. Hu Zhantang, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Xiao Focheng, Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Li Delin, Mr. Feng Huanzhang, ministers of various departments, party headquarters at all levels, various organizations, and various newspapers: Twenty years of turmoil and frequent civil wars have not only left no hope for political reform, but have also depleted the nation's vitality and increasingly degraded its international standing. The loss of the Northeast and the Shanghai-Songhu War of Resistance were caused by internal strife, inviting foreign aggression. It is difficult for the authorities to understand. Telegrams and letters from home and abroad urge unity against foreign aggression. You should repent of the past mistakes of internal strife, which harmed the country and endangered the people. While the blood of those who sacrificed for the country against foreign aggression has not yet dried, internal flames are spreading everywhere, and the situation in Lingnan is reigniting internal conflict. A nationwide civil war is imminent. Millions of overseas Chinese are restricted by harsh residency regulations abroad and see their homelands reduced to ruins. We cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the great rivers and mountains of our motherland be divided and destroyed by a few ambitious people. If you continue to undermine peace, incite internal strife, claim to be righteous, and willingly become the cause of disaster, the overseas Chinese in various regions will jointly condemn and punish you, vowing to abandon you together with the people of the country. Ten thousand miles of sea and sky, in haste and without choice of words. If you would deign to consider, we await your orders. The Philippine Overseas Chinese National Crisis Relief Association, the Manila Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and various chambers of commerce respectfully kowtow.</p>

<h3>Hu Hanmin Elaborates on the True Meaning of Party Rule</h3>
<p>For years, it was not party rule, but military rule</p>
<p>Strongly criticizing the error of military power being above all else</p>
<p>Those who argue otherwise do not observe and still base their criticisms on the events of recent years, attributing mistakes to our Party. The Party, which takes the implementation of the Three Principles of the People and the promotion of revolutionary policies as its guiding principles, cannot bear this blame. I have always maintained that to save the country, we must first save the Party. This is not being blinded by partisan views, but rather because, looking around the country, there is no one else with a history, an ideology, strength, and suitability for China to shoulder the responsibility of saving China except the Kuomintang. This is not only something that my comrades and compatriots should believe in, but also an indisputable fact. As for how to save the Party, so that it can continue and fulfill its historical mission, the details cannot be covered in this article. In short, on the one hand, we must resolutely destroy the long-standing habit of individuals acting arbitrarily and manipulating the Party. Those who have clearly committed crimes against the Party should be openly convicted and severely punished by the Party. On the other hand, we must resolutely unite comrades with a history of ideology to strengthen the Party's organization, strictly enforce Party discipline, first strengthen the Party's strength, and continue the legacy of the Party's leader, Sun Yat-sen, to fight against all counter-revolutionary evil forces. Only in this way can loyal comrades be united, the great cause of the revolution not be abandoned, and the Republic of China have a chance at life. Perhaps they are not clearly aware of the truth of past events, believing that the failure of the Party's revolutionary work is due to the failure of the Party's cadres and comrades to be uniformly responsible. However, history has shown us that with military power being above all else and violence being unleashed without restraint, how could the so-called cadres and comrades be allowed to be uniformly responsible? Moreover, the so-called uniform responsibility should refer to the same ideology, the same policy, and the same goal. Now that the lines between revolution and counter-revolution are different, and the spirits of warlords and comrades are even more different, this day's inability to be unified is just like the Party's past inability to unite with the remnants of the Northern Warlords. Forcing unity would be to unite for prolonged chaos and evil, harming the country and selling it out, which is not what those loyal to the revolution should do. In summary, on the one hand, I base my words on past events to clarify that what has been relentlessly pursued and even intensified for the past five years is actually the continuous rule of warlords since the Republic of China, and not the so-called party rule. On the other hand, we should base ourselves on the Party's decades of dedication to the revolutionary history, understand the actual situation in the country, and confirm that we must first unite loyal comrades and restore the Party to its original form, so that the Party can continue to bear its revolutionary historical mission, in order to destroy all counter-revolutionary forces and save the country from danger, and lead China to the realm of freedom, independence, unity, and construction. From now on, I and all comrades loyal to the Three Principles of the People will dedicate ourselves to this, to continue the legacy of the Party's leader, Sun Yat-sen, and resolutely promote the great cause of the revolution. This aspiration, wherever it leads, will never falter. I hereby present the main points, and I hope that comrades and compatriots will deeply understand them. (The End)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Bandit Suppression in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Banditry is rampant in eastern Hubei</p>
<p>Chiang to arrive in Hankou to supervise the campaign</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Banditry in Hubei Province has long become an unmanageable situation. Recently, the He and Duan sections of central and western Hubei have been slightly suppressed, but the bandits in eastern Hubei have risen again. Bandit forces throughout the province echo each other, as can be seen. The following is a record of the bandit suppression situation:</p>
<p>Recent Bandit Suppression in Various Prefectures: The most powerful Red bandits in Hubei Province are the four groups led by He Long, Duan Dechang, Kuang Jixun, and Kong Hechong. According to official announcements, the combined strength of He and Duan is about 30,000 men, harassing Yingcheng, Jingshan, Tianmen, Mianyang, Qianjiang, Yunmeng, Anlu, and Hanchuan counties. Zaoshi between Jingshan and Yingcheng and Qianjiang County are the locations of He's bandit nests, with the most abundant strength. Diaocha Lake in Honghu is also their escape lair. Within the bandit area, there are Communist Party headquarters, Soviet governments at all levels, peasant associations, labor unions, hospitals, factories, and Red Army headquarters. The troops responsible for bandit suppression in the area are the 48th Division of Xu Yuanquan, the 44th Division of Xiao Zhichu, and the 41st Division of Zhang Zhenhan, all elite troops in central Hubei. For two months, they have been fighting the bandits between Tian, Qian, Jing, and Ying, clashing dozens of times. Recently, they have begun to recover the area east of Zaoshi and are now reorganizing their troops to advance west. At the same time, the Sichuan Army troops entering Hubei have also departed from Yichang to assist in the suppression and have surrounded Qianjiang. According to a telegram from Xiao Zhichu, He Long himself is indeed directing operations in Zhang Dawan, west of Wenjia Field in Yingcheng County. On May 29th, he engaged in fierce fighting with the two brigades of Wang Jinyong and Yu Zhaolong of that division. Our army fought in close quarters several times before finally capturing Wenjia Field on the 30th, and the remnants of the bandits fled west, etc. Zhang Zhenhan's troops also occupied Jiangjia Field on the same day. In order to thoroughly eliminate the bandits, Xu Yuanquan plans to go to the front again in the coming days to supervise the suppression and has also received approval from the Pacification Headquarters to send planes from the 4th Aviation Team every day to assist in bombing. In southern Hubei, Kong's bandits launched a fierce attack on Chongyang in the middle of the month, but after the joint suppression by the two divisions of Xie Bin and Guo Rudong, they retreated to Zhajin, Xiushui in Jiangxi Province, and there is currently no intention of counterattacking. However, the situation in eastern Hubei has recently become urgent again, with reports that most of Kuang's bandits have invaded west of Ying Mountain. Kuang's bandits were entrenched on the border between Huang'an and Henan-Anhui. Since their failed attack on Huangpi in January of this year, they have not crossed the Lei River. The authorities and the people seemed to have forgotten about them and did not pay attention. At the beginning of May, they suddenly harassed Qichun, and County Chief Wang Daozhong was captured. The Huangmei militia also suffered heavy losses. After the Pacification Headquarters dispatched Ge Yunlong's division stationed in Qishui to suppress them, it quickly calmed down. However, on the 29th, more than 10,000 bandits again harassed Luotian, and it was rumored that the county town had fallen. It was also reported that bandits were active in Qishui County at the same time. The official report of the troops' suppression is yet to be announced, so it is impossible to know the details. Presumably, they are still in a bloody battle.</p>
<p>Chiang to Arrive in Hankou to Supervise the Campaign: The reason why banditry in Hubei has been rampant for so long and cannot be eliminated is that Hubei Province is the hub of central China, connecting Anhui to the east, Jiangxi and Hunan to the south, Sichuan to the west, and Shaanxi and Henan to the north. The towering mountains, which were once regarded as natural provincial boundaries, are now all places where bandits can roam freely. Attacking here and fleeing there has also become a routine. In the past two years, the focus has been on the border between Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, but this year, the Jiangxi bandits have fled to Fujian, and the Hunan bandits have also ceased their activities, so the focus has shifted to the border between Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. Their call to meet in Wuhan is also the same as before. Although there are more than a dozen divisions and several independent brigades stationed in Hubei, the area to be defended is vast, and orders cannot be unified, making it difficult to achieve a comprehensive elimination in one fell swoop. Recently, the central government has decided to suppress the bandits, initially appointing Zhu Peide as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region, ordering him to be stationed in Hankou to command and supervise the suppression. However, Zhu declined the appointment, and Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, with Li Jishen, Training Inspector-General, as the Deputy Commander. He will arrive in Hankou immediately to supervise the campaign. After receiving the telegram from Nanjing, He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner here, immediately arranged the headquarters at the address of the Bankers' Association. The preparations were completed on the 30th, and guards were set up at the entrance on the 31st. At the same time, the staff badges of the Pacification Headquarters and the guest badges were declared invalid and new badges were issued to ensure strictness. The welcoming ceremony will be simplified as much as possible. Chiang's three advance aides-de-camp arrived in Hankou on the 30th night aboard the Jihe Wheel to arrange everything. Geng Bozhao, a military advisor to the Military Affairs Commission, also arrived on the same ship. Chiang is expected to arrive in Hankou within a few days. After arriving in Hankou, Chiang will first summon the generals of various armies to Hankou to inquire about the bandit situation and hold a military conference to redistribute the troops before returning to Nanjing. Deputy Commander Li Jishen will then come to Hankou to take charge and command everything.</p>
<p>Raising Funds for Bandit Suppression: Raising funds for bandit suppression is extremely difficult. For a month, the fundraising has not been successful. The loans from the Local Clearing Association and the Hankou Banking Syndicate have also reached a stalemate. Recently, due to the intense bandit activity in eastern Hubei, there is no time for leisurely discussion, so He Chengjun, Xia Douyin, and others came forward to discuss the matter in detail with the banking community and changed the approach to having the Department of Finance directly borrow from the banking syndicate. Shen Zhaonian, the Director of the Department of Finance, contacted the bank presidents again on the afternoon of May 31st, planning to sell 200,000 yuan of bandit suppression bonds and pay the Hankou public debt bonds to the Local Clearing Association in full. A 600,000 yuan bandit suppression loan was secured with the provincial property of Shengcheng Lane as collateral, using the funds from the Local Clearing Association's sale of public debt bonds as a fund for interest payments and principal repayment, with a monthly interest rate of 1%. Starting from August, 100,000 yuan will be repaid each month, limited to six months. On the evening of the 31st, the banking syndicate held an emergency meeting and fully accepted this proposal, but the collateral was slightly changed. The procedures will be discussed on June 1st, and the funds will be signed and delivered on the 2nd. As for the donations from gentry and wealthy merchants, because many gentry and wealthy merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude, it was decided that the Local Clearing Association will send personnel to collect the donations door-to-door with the police, and submit a report to the Pacification Commissioner's Office to ascertain whether the commercial protection donations collected in Xindi and other places have been reported and remitted, and request the provincial government to instruct the Tobacco Prohibition Committee to remit all tobacco prohibition fines from various counties to the association for distribution to the bandit suppression armies (May 31st).</p>
<h3>Situation of Bandit Gangs in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Li Shiding is still in the bandit den</p>
<p>Kuang's gang attempts to seize the Tianjin-Pukou Railway</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The bandit communists in northern Anhui have not been completely suppressed despite repeated supervision and attacks by Chen Tiaoyuan and Wang Jun. According to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Garrison Department, Wang Jun is currently leading his troops to gather at Sanligang and Silipu in Hefei, waiting to advance and suppress the bandits. The 12th Division of Zeng Wanzhong has opened up the front line to block the bandit area, the 1st Division is concentrated in Anqing, and the 4th Division is concentrated in Bengbu. The Military Affairs Commission has also dispatched a squadron of aircraft stationed in Zhengzhou, dividing them between Bengbu and Zhumadian, to assist the army in reconnaissance and bombing of various bandits in Henan and Anhui. As for the situation among the bandits, intelligence reports that there are a total of three armies, including the pseudo 35th Army of Kuang Jixun and the pseudo 4th Army of Xu Xiangqian. In addition, there is another army, all with a three-three system. Hungry people and deserters have joined them. The pseudo general headquarters is located on the west bank of Baobi River between Liu'an and Jinzhai Mountains. When the government comes to suppress them, they place propaganda teams in the front, carrying guns and flags, giving verbal propaganda to trap soldiers with weak will. The bandit suppression armies are slightly at a disadvantage due to the continuous mountains and unfamiliar geography. Most of the officers of the 7th Division who were ambushed due to unclear terrain a month ago have now escaped danger, but Deputy Division Commander Li Shiding is still in the bandit den, receiving preferential treatment. As for the bandits who attempted to harass the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, it was discovered that they were gangs led by Pei Si and others. They were defeated by the Ma Brigade of the 12th Division along the line and by Jiang Kanru, the Commander of the 11th Cavalry Brigade, and Sun Baoyu, the Commander of the 12th Cavalry Brigade, in the area of Luogang and Shangxiahong at the end of May. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway line is currently very peaceful. It is reported that the bandit gang used the name of the Eastern Expedition Army, with Kuang Jixun as the pseudo commander-in-chief, and their goal was to seize the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line. Now that they have been defeated and fled west, if the three provinces actively encircle and suppress them, it can be hoped that they will be eliminated (June 1st).</p>
<h3>Bengbu Garrison Conference</h3>
<p>Xu Tingyao resolves to reorganize the various armies</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: For the sake of reorganizing the various armies, Xu Tingyao, Commander of the 4th Division and concurrently Bengbu Garrison Commander, summoned the heads of the various units stationed in Bengbu, the brigade commanders of the brigades, the officers of the directly subordinated units, and the division headquarters at the garrison headquarters at 2:00 PM on the 30th</p>

<p>The heads of various departments and the chiefs of the water and land public security bureaus, more than 20 people in total, attended the garrison conference at the garrison headquarters. Chairman Xu first reported the significance of the meeting, briefly stating that he had received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, appointing Tingyao as the Bengbu Garrison Commander. When Tingyao came to Bengbu from Nanjing, he received a personal instruction from the Chairman, saying that the troops stationed in Bengbu were not under unified command, and the local order was very chaotic. He should immediately start to reorganize the garrison after arriving at the defense area. Recently, seeing scattered soldiers and vagrants everywhere in the city, it is indeed necessary to reorganize them. Therefore, he specifically convened a meeting to discuss the reorganization methods with everyone, etc. After the report was completed, the discussion began, and the following matters were resolved: (1) The military and police agencies stationed in Bengbu must report to the garrison headquarters once every ten days, and the meeting time is set for 2:00 PM on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month.

In addition to the original detectives of the public security bureau, the garrison headquarters will select and dispatch officers and soldiers to be responsible for detective work. (3) The station inspection will remain the same for the time being, but those who wear military uniforms without symbols will not be allowed to disembark and enter the country. (4) It is urgent to ban the hospital wounded soldiers. The garrison headquarters will send people to the hospital to inspect and confiscate weapons, such as knives, pistols, and grenades, and then try to prohibit them from going out at any time, so that there will be no wounded soldiers causing trouble in the city. (5) The deputy director of the military police supervision office will be concurrently held by the head of the military law office of the 4th Division. (6) The water and land public security bureau and the supervision office must fill out a daily report and submit it to the garrison headquarters every day.

For the cracking of military fires and the arrest of people who disturb public order, they must be sent to the garrison headquarters for handling. (8) Each bureau and office must confiscate and seal up drugs such as heroin and morphine that are cracked for sale, so as to regularly monitor and destroy them jointly with various agencies, and the criminals will be sent to the garrison headquarters for handling. (9) The patrol team should carry a ruler. If soldiers are found causing trouble in the street, those with lighter circumstances should be punished on the spot to show punishment, and those with serious circumstances should be sent to the headquarters for legal action. (10) All vagrants and idlers in this city must be expelled from the country. (11) Recruiting soldiers is strictly prohibited in the garrison area to avoid disturbances, which shall be enforced by the military police supervision office. (12) The password will be issued uniformly by the garrison headquarters. (13) The troops stationed in this city are complex, and the officers of each army should respect themselves and set an example. In particular, the number of soldiers going out should be reduced. If the number of people going out is more than five, they must be led by officers to avoid causing trouble. (14) Soldiers are not allowed to go out after 8:00 PM at night.

<p>Refusing Robbers on a Boat Leads to Tragic Shooting Death: In the area of Shijing Lane in Fengjing, yesterday (the 2nd), a merchant ship was passing through when three robbers on the shore, all carrying handguns, demanded to board the ship. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the merchant ship refused, angering the robbers, who fired three shots, killing the husband and wife on board. The husband's body fell into the river and floated away to an unknown location. The wife died on the ship. The robbers fled. The First Public Security Bureau of the town, after learning of the tragic fate of the merchant couple, immediately reported it to the Prosecutor's Office of the court, which dispatched personnel to the countryside to investigate and apprehend the murderers.</p>
<p>Provincial Order: No Exemption of Rent Allowed: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the provincial treasury's income has been insufficient. Therefore, an order was issued to all counties to collect two months' rent to be submitted to the province for use. This county complied with the order. The first month's rent was collected, but the public, due to the post-war social and economic difficulties, requested that the provincial government exempt the second month's rent to alleviate the people's hardship. The County Chamber of Commerce, the First District Office, and people from all walks of life sent telegrams to the province to plead their case. Now, the county government has received instructions from the provincial government, stating that Shanghai is a war zone and has special circumstances, while this county is relatively far from the war zone. Qingpu has no exemption situation, so it is not appropriate to use it as a precedent. Moreover, the armistice issue has been resolved, and the provincial treasury is in urgent need of funds. The rent already collected for March must be handed over to the Jiangsu Bank for verification without delay and must not be used for any other purpose. At the same time, the remaining rent for March and April should be collected as soon as possible and reported continuously. The request for exemption of the second month's rent should not be discussed.</p>
<p>Provincial Education Fund Office Invites Bids for Brokerage Tax: The provincial brokerage tax has now been resolved by the Provincial Education Funding Committee to invite merchants to bid for management, following the method of the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau. The bidding will be held on the 15th, 16th, and 17th of this month at the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office branch office at No. 4 Tinghou Street, Zhongzheng Road, Nanjing. The announcement has been issued and posted by the Finance Bureau. The county's base amount is set at 13,000 yuan. One-twentieth of the base amount must be paid as a deposit one day before the bidding. After winning the bid, one-fifth of the bid amount must be paid as a deposit within three days. It is heard that those who compete for the bid consider the bid amount too high and are taking a passive attitude.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Robbery in Zhangjiajing Injures Three Severely: In Maojia Field, Xinzhuang Town, Yuanhe District of this county, on the night of the 1st of this month, a large gang of more than a hundred robbers suddenly arrived, all carrying rifles and other sharp weapons. They immediately stationed sentries at the market entrance of the town and then searched every household, leaving no one spared. After the robbery, they went to Ganlu Zhangjiajing on the border of Changshu and Wuxi for looting. The Dang Kou Public Security Bureau nearby heard the news and rushed to the scene. The robbers lined up and resisted the police. For a time, gunshots were as dense as a string of pearls. After more than thirty minutes of fierce fighting, the police were outnumbered and three were seriously injured. They reported to the Huangniqiao police station in the neighboring area and urgently requested assistance. The police station immediately reported to the General Bureau. Director Yin, after receiving the report, immediately requested the county government to allocate 30 police officers, a platoon of provincial security guards, and a police detachment to go to the countryside by Wuxi ferry that day. At the same time, the garrison also sent a unit of soldiers to assist in the suppression. It is reported that the robbers have fled in all directions, and some have been disarmed. The full details are currently unknown and will be reported later.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Rice Robbery and Theft Occur Frequently: The seventh district (Huaihai City) of the county suffered severely from the disaster last year. Now, it is the spring famine, and the poor cannot get enough to eat. Therefore, rice robbery cases have occurred frequently. Three cases occurred on the 27th and 28th of last month. In the past two days, several cases have occurred in the district, as well as in the tenth and eleventh districts. The details are as follows: (1) In Nanyuxiang, Dayuxiang, Chenjiaxiang, and Bilian near Meicun in the tenth district, hundreds of villagers, each holding wooden sticks and rice bags, flocked to the area on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. They first robbed the slightly wealthier families and then the ordinary households. Almost all of the more than 30 households in the three lanes were robbed, with a total of more than 100 shi of white rice being robbed. Yu Renquan suffered the most losses and was also beaten. (2) The home of Qian Xiaoshan in Zhouxiang, Seventh District, was robbed of more than 20 shi of white rice, more than 100 yuan in silver, and 400,000 copper coins by more than ten robbers the night before last. (3) The home of Chen Yibao in Shuangjingqiao, in the same district, was robbed of several shi of white rice by Xu Apei and more than ten other poor people the night before last. (4) The homes of He Jinyuan and He Qiao in Wenshang Township, Eleventh District, were robbed by three robbers in a row. Gold and silver jewelry, clothes, etc. were robbed, resulting in heavy losses. (5) A doctor surnamed Ding near Longshan Shao was robbed of a gold watch by robbers.</p>
<p>Old Monk Torn Apart by Kidnappers: The Songshan Temple in the 436th Tu of the Ninth District (Beishang Township) of the county had a presiding monk named Zheng Xi, who was in his thirties. At about 11:00 PM on the 30th of last month, more than ten robbers suddenly arrived, carrying torches and weapons, and rushed in, holding more than ten monks in the temple and threatening them not to make a sound. They looted wildly, and when they left, they kidnapped the presiding monk Zheng Xi. After counting, a large stone from the east corridor was lost, and the other losses were still under investigation. Yesterday (the 31st) at 4:00 PM, the deputy presiding monk Yueguang came to the city to report to the County Public Security Bureau, requesting the rescue of the hostage and the strict investigation of the stolen goods. Director Hua, after receiving the report, ordered the detective team to go to the countryside for investigation. However, while the police officers were setting off, they received a report from the villagers of the township that the kidnapped old monk Zheng Xi had been found dead in the Chihe River at the foot of Xishan, with his head separated from his body, and the flesh was blurred. Director Hua has ordered the police to strictly investigate the murderers and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Cocoon Markets in Various Townships Open One After Another: This year's spring cocoons in our county are in a terrible state. Very few cocoon markets have reported opening. As of yesterday, there were a total of fifteen: Hengyuan in Beiqiao, Yuantai Chang Zhang Miaoshe Hehede in Luoshe, Hengchang in Ludianqiao, Huiyuan in Anzhen, Yuchang in Beichang Street Cotton Lane Zhou Fuchang, Jiang Qiasheng in Wudongqiao, Gongyu in Yanqiao, Hengchang Yu Zhangcun Hexing in Lifangqiao, Hexing in Luoshe, Xuxingchang Huimin Shizhuang Du Yongtang in Daxuxiang, and several others in the Southern Township. Various roads are scheduled to officially open scales today (the 1st). However, the Zhenchang Cocoon Market in the Gutin Temple in the district had already opened scales on the day before yesterday (the 31st), receiving goods at a high cocoon price of 33 yuan, and there was no cash, but cocoon market joint tickets were issued, which could only be redeemed after three days. However, the villagers were unwilling to sell because the cocoon price was too low, and they all took them back to bake themselves, or used old-fashioned wooden cars to reel themselves. The County Construction Bureau of this county believes that since the cocoon markets have already opened scales, taxes should be levied according to regulations. Yesterday, it specially sent a letter to the Cocoon Industry Association, requesting it to collect a business tax of one yuan per stove and a special construction donation of one yuan per line on behalf of the government, as in previous years. At the same time, the county government issued a notice strictly prohibiting local bullies from selling forcibly and disturbing the peace, and from privately collecting without a permit.</p>

<p>Township Head's Extortion Leads to Death: Sun Dianchao, a farmer from the Sixth General, Tenth Li of the Seventh District of this county, was extorted by Township Head Zhu for unknown reasons the day before yesterday. Zhu then ordered the township soldiers to detain Sun Dianchao and his wife. Sun was so indignant that he committed suicide. Now Sun's wife has come to the city to report to the county government for legal action.</p>
<p>Young Girl Commits Suicide by Poisoning After Being Humiliated: Guan Yongfu, who runs a flower mat shop in Yong'an Town, Seventh District of the county, has two daughters. The eldest daughter is already married, and the second daughter, whose nickname is Xiaodezi, is nineteen years old and quite virtuous. She is still unmarried. The day before yesterday, she was washing socks in front of the shop when Zhang, the second daughter-in-law of the town head Sun, passed by and suddenly said to Xiaodezi, "The foreign socks you are washing were given to you by my husband." Xiaodezi was very angry when she heard this, and the two sides argued with each other. Until the evening, Xiaodezi suddenly found a package of arsenic and secretly took it. She immediately cried to her parents about the situation. Doctors were called to treat her, but the poison had already penetrated her lungs and she died shortly after. Now the girl's parents have contacted the Sun family to negotiate, but it is not known how it will be resolved. A Scandal Involving Workers Harassing Women: An employee of the Xidi Construction Office, 20 li south of the city, had an ambiguous relationship with a woman surnamed Huang in the area.

The workers were furious and went on strike, negotiating with the office. Several workers fell into the water due to crowding and drowned. The workers then turned their anger on the woman surnamed Huang and destroyed her home. It is not known how this matter will be resolved.</p>

<p>Important Educational News</p>
<h3>Automatic Commemoration of June 6th Teachers' Day</h3>
<p>No Need for Ministry of Education to Stipulate and Promulgate for Implementation</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously received a request from Li Buqing et al. (Li once served as an inspector in the former Beijing Ministry of Education) to designate June 6 as Teachers' Day and to issue a nationwide order to hold celebrations uniformly.

The Ministry of Education issued separate instructions yesterday. Excerpts are as follows: (1) The reply to Li Buqing et al. states that it is understood that if school teachers voluntarily choose a certain day of the year as a memorial day, so that teachers from all over can gather to commemorate it on this day and arouse the country's attention to education, the intention is very good and feasible. However, the request to issue a nationwide order to hold celebrations on a scheduled basis by the Ministry is not approved.

<h3>Old Temple Bell Recordings (12) Do Not Remove the Courtyard Grass: Zhai Fu</h3>
<p>Fourteen</p>
<p>Chunsheng, Mrs. Song, and I agreed to go to the city together the next morning to hire a teacher. I was afraid that I might not be able to come back that night, so I entrusted the task of ringing the bell to the little monk and taught him carefully. We set off after breakfast. Mrs. Song had often been to the city. Although Chunsheng had also carried firewood into the city to sell, he would return as soon as the firewood was sold, and he had rarely experienced the scenery of the city. As for me, I was a complete country bumpkin. Going to the city was like going to school for me, and Mrs. Song was my teacher. As soon as my feet stepped into the city, I felt that everything was different from the countryside. I kept asking questions along the way, and Mrs. Song answered me with relish. How happy I was!</p>
<p>We entered the city gate and hadn't walked far when we saw a large, black thing rushing towards us faster than a horse, frightening an old cow in front of us so much that it jumped around. Mrs. Song said, "A car is coming, be careful." To be honest, I was as frightened as that old cow, and quickly retreated to the side of the road. I saw it pass by in a gust of wind, and the dust covered my face. If I hadn't closed my eyes quickly, how could I have gotten the dust out of my eyes? Strange, why are my gums chattering? The dust went into my mouth to play. It turned out that this road was called a "horse road" and was not meant for people to walk on. That's how I went along eating dust, and a few words came out of my mouth:</p>
<p>The big boss rides in a car.</p>
<p>The little boss rides in a rickshaw.</p>
<p>Those who have no car to ride eat dust.</p>
<p>Chunsheng and Mrs. Song laughed and laughed. When we walked into a small street, we saw a young woman walking in front of us. This girl was strange! She didn't comb her hair or wear a braid. She looked a bit like a nun, but nuns are shaved bald, and this girl's hair was longer than a nun's. Mrs. Song said, "This is the most fashionable female student in the city. Look at the leather shoes on her feet, which are the same as the bound feet of the past. These are called high-heeled leather shoes." Before long, we caught up with this girl, and a naughty child came up to her and sang with a sly smile:</p>
<p>Two layers of hair,</p>
<p>Smiling,</p>
<p>Three words and two sentences become husband and wife.</p>
<p>Mrs. Song said, "It's not wrong at all." I asked, "What does 'two layers of hair' mean?" She said, "In the past, girls had to cut their hair once to make it easier to grow well. These female students have cut it a second time, so it's called 'two layers of hair.' I think that's how it's said, but I don't know if it's wrong."</p>

<h3>Municipal Library Open</h3>
<p>The Public Education Center and Garden are Also Open to the Public</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Education Center and Municipal Library in the Wenmiao Temple on Wenmiao Road in this city were originally scheduled to open this spring. Unfortunately, the Japanese invaded Shanghai, and the municipal government, due to the lack of municipal funds, vigorously implemented layoffs and reduced government spending. The two museums were also virtually suspended. Now, the Municipal Education Bureau, in order to meet the needs of the citizens, has ordered the two museums to be temporarily opened from June 1. However, due to the small number of staff in the Municipal Public Education Center and the fact that some of the houses have been affected by the war and have not been completely repaired, the garden part will be opened first for sightseeing. It is heard that when the two museums opened yesterday, there was an unusually large number of people visiting and reading books.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Market State of Hesitation</h3>
<p>Seven Taels Zero Fluctuation - Yesterday (3rd), the gold market appeared weak, but in a complex state, fluctuating around seven taels zero throughout the day, eventually leveling off. Dealers' will was hesitant, receipts and payments were inconsistent, and there was not much volume. Prices fell from the start of the morning market, and although the silver market also fell, it did not have much of an impact. This was mainly due to news that the US might abolish the gold standard and that a large amount of cash was being shipped to France, which had an impact. Prices had already fallen to 720 taels. Afterwards, short positions were covered, and the foreign exchange rate was stable, leading to an improvement. Prices then hovered around 720 taels. The afternoon was very uneventful, with only a fluctuation of one or two taels. Finally, the price closed at around 720 taels. The detailed situation of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>Low in the Morning, Gradual Recovery - The opening price for July in the morning was</p>
<p>still average, at 720 taels and 5 qian. The price of silver, which had been rising for many days, reversed and fell by 1/8 to 3/16. The silver price fell by 3/8, but the ground was not good. After the market closed, someone bought in, still increasing by 1/16, but sellers were waiting. There were also various unfavorable news for the gold market, causing the price to be less optimistic. Soon, Yuan Hengyuan, Mao Shunli, Wanxing, etc. all rushed to sell, causing the price to plummet by 4 taels, eventually reaching 16.5 taels. Not long after, Hengyu, Fuyu, Tongchun, Yuhe, Zhifengyong, and speculators all bought in, immediately turning the situation around, with an increase of over 6 taels. Since MacKay &amp; Co. absorbed 180,625 taels of British gold for July, it became 23 taels. Xie Xingyong, Bing Xingyuan, Mao Yong, etc. sold, causing a decline of 4 taels, reaching 18 taels and 8 qian at 9:30. HSBC's quoted price did not change, and the internal situation seemed firm. Huabi absorbed 181,25 taels of British gold for September, and MacKay sold US dollars to Yuntong for September at $31.375. Fuyu, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Hongkangyong, etc. all bought in, and short positions were also covered, causing the market to improve and soar. At around 9:50, the price reached 23 taels and 8 qian. After that, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Bing Xingyuan, Tai Hengyifengyong, etc. all came to sell. Since September US dollars could be settled at $31.5, the price fell by 4-5 taels. Yifeng also sold, reaching 18 taels and 8 qian at 10:20, with a fluctuation of no more than 1 tael. Afterwards, the Dalian gang and goods hedgers bought in. Holland absorbed US dollars for July at $30.9375, reaching 21.5 taels at 11:15. Yuan Chengyong, Bing Xing, etc. sold, and there were rumors that the United States planned to join the silver price conference, causing the market to decline and retreat to 18.5 taels. Later, retail investors bought in, and the market closed at 19 taels and 7 qian. The listed price was 790 taels, with a discount of 70 taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Entered a Mediocre Situation - The afternoon market opened at 19 taels and 2 qian, followed by 19 taels and 8 qian to 19 taels. The Dalian gang's entries and exits were mixed, and Hengyu sold. After 2:30, Zhifengyong, Bing Xing, etc. also came to sell. Since the foreign exchange market was stable, with Shanghai offering September at $31.5 and Anda offering July at $1, the price weakened, reaching 17 taels and 3 qian at 3:30. Afterwards, Yifengyong, Hengyu, Yongfengyifeng, etc. all bought in. Since Huabi absorbed half a dollar of US dollars for September and Shanghai absorbed 125 taels of British gold for August, the gold price rose by more than 2 taels. However, the fluctuation was only 1 tael in an hour. The market closed at 4:30 at 20 taels and 2 qian, slightly lower than the previous day by 3 qian. The maximum fluctuation during the day was 23 taels and 8 qian, and the minimum was 16 taels and 5 qian, a fluctuation of 7 taels and 3 qian. The listed price was discounted by 70 taels, and the registration water supplement was 20 taels. The red slip was increased by 10 taels and 25.</p>
<p>Receipts and Payments Varied, Volume Not Large - According to statistics of transactions on the trading floor, Fuyu, Hengyu, Zhifengyong, Hongkangyong, and Wanxing all bought in.

The Dalian gang sold more than 900 bars and bought more than 800 bars. The Guangdong gang bought in slightly.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Slightly Reveals Signs of Loosening</h3>

However, HSBC's listed prices only reduced Indian and German exchange rates by 0.25 each, and the French franc increased by 1 yuan.

<h3>Securities Selling Prices Rebound by Small Fractions</h3>
<p>Trading Volume Over 4.7 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday (3rd), the bond market situation at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange showed that spot transactions were still active, with a trading volume of 111,500 yuan, including 36,200 yuan of domestic unified tax, 33,500 yuan of 20 rolls, 12,000 yuan of retrenchment, 10,000 yuan of finance, and only a few thousand yuan for other bonds. The futures market was slightly weaker than before, but the market sentiment was generally still lively. The trading volume in the morning market was about 2.8 million yuan, and only over 1.8 million yuan in the afternoon market, totaling 4,622,500 yuan, including about 900,000 yuan for domestic unified salt tax, 710,000 yuan for 20 rolls, 500,000 yuan each for 19 good and 20 customs, and other bonds were quiet. Transactions in July futures were extremely rare. As for the price trend of each bond, since the continuous rise in recent days, the market was quite good, and the bond market environment also felt a turning point. Yesterday, market demand was slightly sluggish, with large investors not continuing to buy in, and quite a few people taking advantage of the price increase to sell, so the price suddenly declined. Although there were fluctuations before and after, the market was always in a sluggish state and it was difficult to hope for continued firmness. As a result, compared with the previous day, the rebound was several corners to half a yuan, with only retrenchment, 19 customs, and 20 customs rolls falling by as much as one yuan. Also, municipal bonds had no market for a long time, but there were some transactions yesterday.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Has Rebounded</h3>
<p>(Report by American Eastern Bank)</p>
<p>On Thursday, the New York stock market turned positive because the sales tax bill had been accepted by the Senate, and all parties began to seek ways to maintain the securities market. Banks also cooperated to buy government bonds to maintain bond prices. Major commodities such as cotton and wheat also trended higher. On the same day, the securities market was initially affected by the weakness of utility stocks, but later became firm due to enthusiastic buyers. US Steel rose by 2.32 pounds, which was the most impressive. Railroad stocks averaged a gain of 0.92. It is said that at the International Oil Conference, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union had no concrete plans for maintaining market prices, but gasoline stocks were very firm on Thursday. Overall, the situation has improved, and the interest of outsiders has gradually increased, so the market has become very lively. On Thursday, 1.9 million shares were traded, which was unprecedented in recent weeks. Unless there are special changes, the lowest price seen the day before may not fall again. The Dow Jones index on Thursday is as follows:</p>
<p>June 1st | June 2nd | Change</p>
<p>---|---|---</p>
<p>20 Industrials | 44.93 | 47.25 | Up 2.32</p>
<p>20 Railroads | 14.10 | 15.02 | Up 0.92</p>
<p>20 Utilities | 16.73 | 17.40 | Up 0.67</p>
<p>Attached is the American Eastern Bank's Shanghai Commercial Securities Daily Index:</p>
<p>June 2nd: 20.78 June 3rd: 20.88 Up: 0.10</p>
<p>1931-1932 Highest: 28.66 (September 12, 1931)</p>
<p>1931-1932 Lowest: 20.75 (May 5, 1932)</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Slightly Improved</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation, after a sharp drop on the previous day, showed a slight improvement today, and the market atmosphere was slightly better. The purchase of yarn from the South China port has not been interrupted. The general mentality in this city is that the base has become smaller, and there is a strong desire to go long. However, judging from the overall world situation, it is unusually pessimistic. The price of 20-count yarn in a certain country is only about 117.7 taels at the local price. Compared with the Shanghai 20-count Ren Zhong yarn price of over 163 taels, the price difference is very large. Therefore, Japanese factories in Shanghai are secretly carrying out fierce operations. The North China area is closed, and Chinese yarn has disappeared. Moreover, the Yangtze River area is also dull and stagnant. Due to the economic downturn, farmers' purchasing power is weak. At present, only the Guangdong gang is still healthy and can maintain the market. There is not much optimism about the future.</p>
<p>Ren Biao Market Sentiment Improved - In the morning opening of Ren Biao, the market sentiment was slightly better due to the rebound of US cotton. Each month rebounded by 3-4-5 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the actual demand was good, and each month rose by another 2-4-5 qian. The total transaction statistics for the day were 5,450 bales. It was found that Jifeng sold 350 bales, Yukang sold 350 bales, Dachang sold 350 bales, and Yuantai sold 300 bales. Yiyu bought 250 bales, Yicheng bought 250 bales, Xincheng bought 350 bales, Changfeng bought 500 bales, and Renfeng bought 300 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Ren Biao | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day | Number of Bales on Account</p>
<p>---|---|---|---</p>
<p>September | 1540 | Up 7 | 27,400</p>
<p>July | 1538 | Up 8 | 16,850</p>
<p>October | 1541 | Up 5 | 33,100</p>
<p>August | 1540 | Up 10 | 24,850</p>
<p>November | 1540 | Up 5 | 21,650</p>
<p>Total |  |  | 123,850</p>
<p>Actual Demand From Guangdong Is Not Weak - The sales of spot yarn are still good. It was found that various gangs bought 1,150 bales for the whole day, and 700 bales for futures. The market price rose by 2.5 qian to 5 qian. Buyers from Sichuan entered 170 bales, Wuhu entered 30 bales, Ningbo entered 20 bales, Guangdong entered 725 bales, Changsha entered 25 bales, the inland entered 25 bales, Yunnan entered 80 bales, Zhenjiang entered 60 bales, the North gang entered 5 bales, Xuzhou entered 400 bales of futures, and Shantou entered 300 bales of futures.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Follows the Turnaround of US Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly better, US cotton has rebounded, and people's hearts have been slightly encouraged. Those who have made profits are covering their short positions. However, according to calculations, Yinpan Mitt cotton is only sold for 312 taels. It was found that US cotton arrived at 5 fen the day before. This low price has not been seen in recent decades. Under these circumstances, it is extremely difficult for the market to improve. Therefore, the current cotton in the hands of trading companies, in view of the fact that various factories have no sales, can only sell out in the futures market one after another. As a result, it is difficult for the market to stand still. It fell by 1 tael the day before, and today it has risen by 3-4 qian following the rebound of foreign cotton. However, large investors are still selling non-stop. Judging from the situation of foreign cotton, the future of the cotton market is still bearish.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rebounds by 3-4 Qian - In the morning opening of Zheng Biao, although US cotton rose, the market sentiment was average. Each month only rose by 1-2 qian. In the afternoon, retail investors covered short positions, and the price rose by 2 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 25,100 dan. It was found that Tongfu sold 1,600 dan, Yichang sold 1,800 dan, Yuanda sold 1,500 dan, Tiancheng sold 1,300 dan, Changfeng sold 600 dan, and Renfeng sold 900 dan. Jifeng bought 1,500 dan, Hengyi bought 1,000 dan, Renfeng bought 1,300 dan, Changhe bought 1,100 dan, Changfeng bought 800 dan, and Tongxing bought 700 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day | Number of Dan on Account</p>
<p>---|---|---|---</p>
<p>October | 3185 | Up 4 | 84,100</p>
<p>July | 5120 | Up 25 | 47,200</p>
<p>November | 3180 | Up 4 | 56,800</p>
<p>August | 3110 | Up 35 | 72,800</p>
<p>Total |  |  | 260,700</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Is Cheap and Domestic Cotton Consumption Is Low - Spot cotton business is average, and factories still do not have a large appetite, because foreign cotton is cheap.</p>
<p>Haiti Top Grade 29.75 - Yongyu Factory Entered 500 Bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Also 29.75 - Yukang Factory Entered 100 Bales Also</p>
<p>Yao Hua 28.75 - Yongyu Factory Entered 1,100 Bales Also</p>
<h3>Yarn Exchange Certificates Still Follow Old Rules, Complete Restoration of Substitutes</h3>
<p>Regarding the Flower Yarn Exchange Certificates, previously half were replaced with cash substitutes. As of the 2nd, the cash portion has been abolished and the old rules have been restored, using substitutes for the total amount. As a result, business is said to be picking up.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Rises, British and Egyptian Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm due to strong buying by fellow traders on Wall Street and an increase in buyers. Futures rose 20 to 24 points, and spot prices rose 25 points. British cotton futures fell 11 to 13 points, and spot prices fell 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 10 points. Indian cotton market was closed.

<h3>Silk and Tea: Early Silkworm Cocoon Production in Jiangyin Scarce and of Poor Quality</h3>
<p>Few Cocoon Shops Opening: Price Only 15-16 Yuan</p>
<p>In Jiangyin's Da Xiao Qingyang, Changshou and other townships, this year's early silkworm rearing suffered from unfavorable weather conditions. During the third and fourth molts, most of the silkworms were abandoned. After mounting the frames, unusual cold weather with thunderstorms resulted in insufficient silk spinning and a severe cocoon shortage. The cocoons themselves are also thin and of poor quality. Few cocoon shops are opening, estimated to be only four or five, and they are strictly selecting top-quality goods and setting price limits for purchases. Therefore, the cocoon price is only opening at 15-16 yuan. Silkworm farmers are mostly using traditional stoves for drying. The late silkworms being reared in various townships are also experiencing delayed development due to excessive rain and cold weather. The early batches are only mounting the frames for cocoon making, which is unfavorable for silkworm harvest, making it difficult to expect a good yield.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Zhenmei Tea Already Showing Movement</h3>
<p>After the opening of Tunxi Zhenmei green tea in this port last week, the market has been stagnant for many days. Chinese tea merchants, recognizing the deteriorating situation, have had to lower prices to seek sales. Yesterday, Yihe, Xiehe, Tongfu and other firms started to move and open the market, with prices ranging from 100 to 120 taels, a drop of 30 to 40 taels compared to before. As a result, the sales of Suei'an Zhenmei have also become smoother. However, with the market price falling below the 100 tael mark, Chinese merchants will all suffer losses. The demand for Qimen and Fuliang black teas in the London market is still strong. British merchants are still making every effort to buy, and the sales prices have not changed significantly. The market trends for both red and green teas have entered a normal track, and there is hope for continued development in trading.</p>
<h3>News from Anhui and Jiangxi on New Teas</h3>
<p>Tunxi Tea Firms Begin Selecting and Processing</p>
<p>New tea from Xiuyi County has been harvested and processed by mountain households for ten days, and new goods are gradually flooding the market. Various firms in Tunpu are rushing to produce and transport the teas to Shanghai to seize the new market, and after receiving news of new black tea prices in the Shanghai market, they are actively buying in the villages. Recently, dozens of places have opened for purchasing in various villages, with prices rising from 70 yuan to 80 yuan. Mountain households are holding back goods to get higher prices, and even with a price of 80 yuan, they are still not satisfied. The firms have no choice but to agree to a follow-the-market-high method, opening for tea delivery first, and calculating the price according to the highest market price within an agreed time limit. Mountain households are not losing out with this method and are mostly happy to sell. Firms with larger purchases have recently begun selecting and roasting the teas, and new shipments of Zhenmei should arrive in Shanghai within the month.</p>
<p>Yugan Tea Sales Slow, Prices Low</p>
<p>This year's tea production in Yuyi is both early and tender. Although banditry in the four townships has not been eliminated, people are still able to maintain stability. New teas from various villages have been harvested and processed since the beginning of the month. However, because the area is a bandit zone, distant tea merchants are mostly afraid to enter the mountains to purchase. Except for Raozhou, Hekou, provincial merchants, and store dealers who have some sales, foreign firms are rarely involved. Therefore, it is difficult to raise mountain prices, and the market price is only 20 yuan per dan. Mountain households still have 60-70% of their tea unsold.</p>
<p>Wuyuan New Tea Market Prices Have Been Announced</p>
<p>Tea firms in Wuyi County have recently been buying teas ahead of schedule, as new teas from various villages are about to finish harvesting and production, and the yield is reported to be declining. To avoid Tunxi tea merchants getting ahead, they have been sending people out to purchase. In addition to sending staff to Dexing border and southern Wuyuan to purchase in recent days, they have now sent personnel to explore prices. However, new teas in the northeastern townships have mostly not finished harvesting and production, and sellers believe that the time is not yet ripe, so there are few takers. The new market price for Guyu tender tea from Longhe in southern Yuyi was opened yesterday at 80 yuan per dan, 30 yuan higher than last year. This market price is an exception and not the normal market price. Today, tea firms in Shangtan in northern San Du in the county agreed on a market price of 62 yuan, more than 10 yuan higher than before. Other villages have not yet announced follow-up prices, and buyers and sellers are currently brewing and negotiating to open for purchases.</p>
<p>Opening of Fuliang Green Tea Awaits</p>
<p>Southeastern Fuliang green tea has been selling well recently, and the quality and taste are considered good. Mountain households are storing the processed tea, waiting for sales. This area is close to Xiuyi, and Xiutun tea merchants have already come here to negotiate prices. Mountain households believe that this year's tea production is reduced and costs are high, so they hope for higher prices later and are not in a hurry to sell at this time. Transactions and openings are rare. The highest grade Shiding Mao Feng is being purchased quite a bit recently, with market prices rising from 6 jiao to 1.2 yuan per jin. This is because the mountains are high and long, and the tea leaves produced are very tender, with a better aroma and flavor than other places, and are suitable for sale in foreign stores. Mountain households are not worried about unsold goods, and are holding back for higher prices, so opening for purchases still awaits.</p>
<h3>Grain: River Downstream Rice Market Turns Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Fengji Pier rice market in southern Shanghai, there were more than 50 sources from various regions. About 30 from Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Tongxiang, Pinghu, and Liyi, and more than 10 from Qingpu and Xitang, and seven or eight from Pinghu and Songjiang. The local shops were quiet. Prices opened firm in the morning, but weakened in the afternoon. Thick and thin japonica rice, Feilai Feng, and other varieties all settled.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: About 30 boats arrived at Suzhou Creek yesterday. The market was not very active in the morning. Prices fluctuated slightly. Changzhou and Wuxi japonica rice and Kunshan rice were firm at the top grades but weak at the lower grades. Thin rice and early rice were both down 1 jiao. Glutinous rice was unchanged. Foreign Lu Jian was short in supply and there was no market.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales Stop, Down Half a Jiao</h3>
<p>Futures Traders Continue to Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was stagnant, with traders from various regions ceasing to buy. Foreign firms continued to sell, and the market was unusually sluggish. Prices immediately dropped by 0.05-0.06 yuan. After the local streets and rural dealers actively handled the situation, the market stabilized. Futures were sold by Sassoon, with 500 tons of Mindang for June delivery at a price of 5.26 yuan, also down 0.02 yuan from yesterday. Currently, foreign rice is offered at 11 yuan for 1,000 bags of Mindang, 10.095-10.08 yuan for 600 bags of small Jiaozhi, 10.072 yuan for 200 bags of old rice, 10.005 yuan for 200 bags of red small Jiaozhi, 9.7 yuan for 100 bags of old coarse rice, 10.01 yuan for 200 bags of Qiara land coarse rice, 10.057 yuan for 200 bags of Taizhou white rice offered by Kexian, and 14.46-10.03 yuan for 700 bags of Jiangxi Jiyuan. All were purchased by local merchants.</p>
<h3>Flour Exchange Resumes Trading Today</h3>
<p>Current Flour in a Quiet Process</p>
<p>The Flour Exchange is scheduled to reopen trading today, but trading for June will be suspended, and trading will start from July. Yesterday, the current flour market was quiet and sluggish. Customers are thinking that new wheat is entering the market and sales are decreasing, and financial lending has not yet returned to normal. Even if there is trading, it is only for immediate purchase and sale, and no one dares to hoard. The sluggishness of the market is not without reason. Yesterday, the initial opening was 2.0325 yuan, which then slightly decreased to 0.03 yuan. There were still more sellers than buyers, and the market looked weak. A total of 3,000 bags of warship flour were traded, and nothing else was done. However, the warship factory's offer was still at 2.0375 yuan, which felt calm.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Stone Pier Sun-Dried Meat, Long Out of Stock, Has Arrived</h3>
<p>Stone Pier sun-dried meat has been out of stock for a long time, mainly due to the small inventory and high prices at the source. Yesterday, it was heard that several pieces arrived on the Jinan steamship, but no samples have been seen yet. It is said that the cost is quite high. If it is bright red and the meat slices are thick, it should sell well. However, there has not been much going out through export lately, and the local market is also limited, so the market price may not be too high.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White Sugar Market Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Local Factory Ice Sugar Up 0.01 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Sugar Market Association, the market Liu Pan was quite active, but there were few sellers, and the market atmosphere was quite strong. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white sugar traded at 13.75-13.8 yuan. Hong Kong goods were at 13.6 yuan, and the market remained brisk. Dutch red sugar No. 10 was at 9.75-9.8 yuan, and the trend was also strong. Taikoo Sugar Tianjin B Mark was at 16.3 yuan, the original CX Mark was at 15.6 yuan, and H Mark was at 12.3 yuan. There were not many transactions, and the market outlook was stable. Due to the rising price of raw material coarse sand white sugar, the local factory's ice sugar also followed the rise. No. 1 goods were at 15.5 yuan and No. 2 were at 15.4 yuan. Zhen Ji and other factories all had sales, which was 0.01 yuan higher than the previous market. The market situation was unusually brisk.</p>
<h3>Hardware: The Major Clearance Period Has Passed</h3>
<p>Hardware Market Gradually Becomes Active</p>
<p>Hardware trading has recently shown a gradual increase in activity. It is believed that the major clearance period for customers has passed, and the factory's preparations are also very good. A large number of goods have been offered on the market. Although the price has not increased for the time being, it is much better than before. Over 300 dan of copper were traded yesterday at a price of 37.5 yuan. Over 600 barrels of French nails were also offered yesterday, but most of them were local factory goods, and the price did not fluctuate. More than 100 dan of new lead wire and new iron wire were purchased by traders from the Yangtze River region. New lead wire prices were relatively firm, while new iron wire prices were slightly weak. Green lead was at 13.4 yuan yesterday, with few transactions. There were large-scale sales of tinplate, which were purchased by the factory, but the price did not change much. New foreign dollar cut-iron and triangular iron were also being negotiated, but the market was neither good nor bad.</p>

<h3>Issue of Complete Withdrawal of Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Although the Japanese Side Has Replied, It Has Not Indicated Anything</p>
<p>Our Side's Committee Decides to Continue Negotiations</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese troops, our side's committee members, Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing, officially sent a letter to Japanese committee member Okazaki the day before yesterday, demanding that the spirit of the agreement be implemented promptly, and that the situation be restored to its original state before January 28th. It is understood that the Japanese side has responded to this matter yesterday, stating in the letter the situation of the Japanese army's withdrawal in the past, as well as the troops of the Japanese army currently stationed in Shanghai. The complete withdrawal issue was not mentioned. Our side's committee members have expressed that they need to continue negotiations on this matter. If the Japanese side does not show sincere intention, they will decide to bring the matter to the joint committee of neutral countries for resolution.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Talks About the Trend of the Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Problem Must Be Solved as a Whole</p>
<p>The Free City is the Air of a Few Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>Vice Minister Guo Taiqi returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and will be leaving for England on a scheduled date. Reporters from various newspapers visited Mr. Guo yesterday and asked about the rumored round table conference and the free city. According to Mr. Guo, if the round table conference can completely solve the entire Sino-Japanese problem, then our country will definitely do its best to make it happen. If we want to divide the problem of the Eastern Provinces and Shanghai into two separate solutions, then not only will the people of the whole country oppose it, but the central authorities will also not blindly agree to it. The fallacy of Shanghai's free city is completely the air spread by a few foreign capitalists, and there is absolutely no value in believing it. The government authorities have decided to ignore it. The central government has decided on the entire six-point plan for the Eastern Provinces and Shanghai issue, and no changes are allowed. My trip to England has not yet been decided. If I decide to go abroad, the date of departure will still be two periods later.</p>
<h3>The Homing Union Urges the Convening of a Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>It is Not Known How the Leading Consuls Will Dispose of It in the Future</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the Shanghai Homing Union sent a letter to the leading consul, Cunninghame, on June 1, asking the Shanghai Consular Corps and the Diplomatic Corps to negotiate as soon as possible to convene a round table conference as soon as possible, in order to determine the future status of Shanghai and resolve various outstanding issues between China and foreign countries. The letter stated that the committee of the Homing Union had approved the resolution of the British Association to convene a round table conference, and it was heard that the Shanghai American, British, French, Italian, Japanese, and Dutch Chambers of Commerce had also approved this plan. At present, there are several important matters related to the happiness and good government of Shanghai that urgently need to be resolved. These incidents have caused misunderstandings and conflicts, leading to major disputes. In addition, the British Association Chairman, Hu Tehai, sent a letter to the Diplomatic Corps with the same wording, but specifically mentioned the three matters of the poor management of the Concession Court, the appearance of armed forces in Shanghai, and the construction of roads outside the Concession. The Continental Daily representative inquired with representatives of various foreign chambers of commerce in this port yesterday (June 3) as to whether they had approved the plan to convene a round table conference, but the representatives were reluctant to disclose the information and would not directly answer. Only one chamber of commerce representative was more straightforward and admitted that the chamber of commerce to which he belonged had approved the plan. According to the chambers of commerce, all recent meetings have been held in strict secrecy. On May 31, a similar letter was sent to the Homing Union, asking them to do their best to accomplish this goal.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Side Secretly Urges All Countries to Expand the Concessions</h3>
<p>To Be Submitted for Discussion at the Round Table Conference</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that regarding the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese troops, they have completely withdrawn. The only areas that have not been withdrawn are the Zhabei District (i.e., District D) and the area east of the Songhu Road line, west of North Sichuan Road, north of Laobazi Road, and south of Hongkou Park. This area was originally a road built beyond the Concession, and is currently occupied by the Japanese Marine Corps, who are unwilling to withdraw. Although our authorities have repeatedly ordered committee members Yu and Wen to negotiate with the Japanese side through the Joint Committee, there has been no effect. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency obtained a surprising piece of information: the Japanese authorities are currently secretly working with the local authorities of various countries in Shanghai, intending to turn the area into a Concession. In the past, our side had repeatedly negotiated with the Public Works Department on the issue of roads built beyond the Concession, requesting their return, but the Public Works Department was unwilling to give up these unexpected rights, so there were no results. Now, the Japanese are playing to their liking, secretly contacting the local officials of all parties in Shanghai, willing to temporarily occupy the area, and at the future round table conference, the Japanese side will propose to expand the Concession area with this area, so that it can be jointly managed by all countries, and in reality, the area has already become a region under the commercial sphere of influence of the Japanese. If it becomes a Concession jointly managed by all countries, it will be tantamount to a Japanese Concession. It is rumored that our authorities have learned of this matter.</p>
<h3>Two Battalions of the 9th Division Arrived in Longhua Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Undertake the Defense of the South City and Other Places</p>
<p>More Troops Will Arrive Later</p>
<p>In the southern part of Shanghai, at the end of the Sino-Japanese War, our troops stationed there retreated to the rear. Recently, in order to maintain order there, we have begun to station troops again. Four or five days ago, two companies of military police were sent to be stationed near the Longhua Garrison Headquarters. The day before yesterday, two battalions of the 9th Division were also sent from Fengjing along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and arrived in Longhua at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. After that, they will be stationed in the Longhua South City area to undertake the defense of the area. More troops will arrive later. The details of their arrival in Shanghai are recorded below.</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai: The first and second battalions of the 50th Regiment of the 9th Division arrived in Longhua from Fengjing at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. At that time, the regimental commander, Xie Fusan, went to the Garrison Headquarters to contact Commander Dai and ask for instructions. Commander Dai ordered Regimental Commander Xie to station the regiment headquarters in the Longhua Temple, and the second battalion was also stationed in the temple. The first battalion was stationed near the Garrison Headquarters on Jinji Road.</p>
<p>Deployment Location: After the regiment and battalion soldiers of the 51st Regiment arrived in Shanghai, it was heard that they would be stationed in Longhua and other places in southern Shanghai. The security force in the area relies only on the Security Team of the Public Security Bureau, which is weak, so special troops were sent. More troops will arrive later, so that local security can be further consolidated.</p>
<p>General Information: The two battalions of the regiment are under the control of the 9th Division. The commander of the 9th Division is Li Yannian, who was originally the deputy commander of the 88th Division. He was promoted to commander of the 9th Division because of his great achievements in the Songhu Resistance War. The first and second battalions are quite strong, as they were reorganized from the former Whampoa Training Corps.</p>
<p>Japanese Surprise: After our troops arrived yesterday morning, the Japanese side learned of the news immediately. Okazaki, the Japanese representative of the Joint Committee, was greatly surprised. The Japanese authorities also opposed it. However, according to our authorities, our troops naturally have absolute power to mobilize within their own territory, and the Japanese authorities must not interfere. Moreover, according to the Armistice Agreement, there are already regulations regarding the temporary stationing of Chinese troops, and those not within the regulations are not subject to the restrictions of the agreement.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Closing Ceremony of the Municipal Residents' Local Maintenance Committee</h3>
<p>Mayor Personally Delivered Admonitory Remarks</p>
<p>Declaration of Closure Announced</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Residents' Local Maintenance Committee, initiated in late January when the incident was about to occur, and established at the end of January during the intense anti-Japanese period, has a past record of work that is admirable. Now that the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement has been signed, and order in the Shanghai-Woosung area is gradually being restored, a closing ceremony was held yesterday afternoon at 6 PM on Route Ghisi. The details of the various aspects are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees Yesterday's attendees included Shi Liangcai, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Xiaolin, Guo Shun, Hu Yunqiu, Xu Xinliu, Hu Yunzhuang, Hu Mengjia, Xu Ji, Qian Xinzhi, Lin Kanghou, Li Fukun, Tang Shoumin, Huang Renzhi, Tao Leqin, You Jusun, Chen Songyuan, Wang Boqi, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Bingwen, Nie Lusheng, Chen Liting, Pan Xulun, Gui Yanfang, Mu Ouchu, Liang Shichun, Hu Yun'an, Niu Huisheng, Zhu Yinjiang, Lu Bohong, Chu Huiseng, Bei Songsun, Chen Zeqing, He Dekui, Zhu Ziqiao, Zhang Gongquan, Wu Yunzhai, Xu Lishu, Yu Zukui, Wang Binyan, Qin Runqing, Chen Guangfu, Zou Bingwen, Pei Yunqing, Yu Zuoting, Guo Le, Feng Bingnan, Gu Xinyi, Ye Fuxiao, He Shangping, Pang Jingzhou, Qian Zhixiang, Yang Xixian, Zhang Weiru, Xu Jingshi, Tang Feiyu, Zhang Yishu, Yu Zunfeng, Yan Fuqing, Yang Zhixiong, Qi Yunqing, Hu Yunlai, Zhang Gangbo, Hu Bijang, and others, along with Mayor Wu Tiecheng, totaling more than sixty people.</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony (1) Chairman's address, (2) Reports on unfinished matters by various groups, (3) Reading of the closing declaration, (4) Mayor's admonitory remarks, (5) Chairman's reply, (6) Members' speeches, (7) Chairman's announcement of closure.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report Chairman Shi Liangcai stated that although today is the last general meeting of this committee, the attendance is particularly large, which shows that the spirit of this committee is full. Now, we will conclude all unfinished matters and strive for a complete and practical result. Now, I invite Mayor Wu to deliver his admonitory remarks.</p>
<p>Mayor's Admonitory Remarks Mayor Wu Tiecheng said in his admonitory remarks, "In times of crisis, your committee came together to deal with all local events. Regarding the maintenance of public order and the supply of military needs, you were able to make ample arrangements. This is truly because the members of your committee are all pillars of society. At that time, the government was unprepared, and your committee came forward to assist, enabling the military to sustain itself for more than a month. Moreover, the relief of refugees and the慰勞 of soldiers were even more orderly and effective, allowing the activities of society to be fully发挥. Its effectiveness was even greater and faster than what the government did. Now, on behalf of the government, I respectfully thank all of you for your efforts to society and the country. Furthermore, I especially hope that although your committee has ended in form, your future efforts must be even more glorious than before, because the society and the country need all of you 公正切, and you must not rest on your laurels from now on. Not only does the government rely on you.”</p>
<p>Chairman's Reply Chairman Shi Liangcai thanked Mayor Wu for his encouraging words and said that the committee's minor achievements were truly due to Mayor Wu's loyal guidance, and the colleagues will certainly not lag behind in future efforts.</p>
<p>Members' Speeches Mu Ouchu, representing the members, replied, "This committee was hastily established under the flames of war and during the refuge, and the hardships and difficulties can be said to have been fully experienced. Fortunately, with the assistance and guidance of Mayor Wu, there were no major setbacks. The colleagues initially had great hopes, but ultimately, due to their limited capabilities, they were not allowed by the environment and were unable to carry out the task thoroughly. This is regrettable. However, the colleagues' actions, whether meritorious or guilty, will be judged fairly by society. What is reassuring is that the fullness of spirit is rarely seen in past meetings. Originally, the matters handled during this extraordinary disaster should have been handled by the government. This committee reluctantly responded, also because Mayor Wu advocated官民合作, which contributed to it. As for assisting the military this time, it is actually the consensus of the people of the whole country. We are just following behind them, seeking military-civilian cooperation in addition to官民合作. This committee has ended. The colleagues' nation-saving project is only a preliminary step. The national crisis has reached this point, and the colleagues should certainly not shirk their responsibility. Any sacrifice is worth it, because the work of saving the country is not the responsibility of others."</p>
<p>Yu Wang's Speech Yu Qiaqing said in his speech, "The establishment of this committee this time is largely due to the call of Mr. Shi Liangcai. On the government side, it has also gradually made efforts in military affairs. As a result, the Japanese soldiers withdrew. Although the losses were great, the land was not lost. This is all due to Mayor Wu's guidance and the citizens' willingness to sacrifice for the country, so the spirit of doing things is increasing day by day. Moreover, there are many things to do in the future, and I hope that Chairman Shi will continue to lead. Wang Xiaolai continued his speech, generally the same as above.</p>
<p>Closing Declaration Huang Renzhi read the closing declaration, "The establishment of our Shanghai Municipal Residents' Local Maintenance Committee was initiated in late January when the incident was about to occur, and established at the end of January when resistance to the enemy was intense. At that time, airplanes filled the sky and cannons boomed in our ears. Our patriotic soldiers, indignant at the arrogance and brutality of the enemy army, fought with fewer against many, advancing one after another, unwavering in their righteousness. All the people of our city, regardless of age or gender, felt indignant and motivated,商休 their city, 工閉 their肆, 十輟 their學, with ten thousand hearts united, exhausting their physical strength, financial resources, and material resources to support the rear of the patriotic soldiers. The colleagues of this committee followed all the citizens and masses of our city, calling and running around, neglecting sleep and forgetting food, going out before寅 and not returning after戍, even holding meetings three or four times a day, always wanting to勉延 the precarious lives of all the people of our city from extreme destruction. Alas, why did our solemn and brilliant Shanghai, our peace-loving citizens, have this? This is what we colleagues feel indignant about when we recall the beginning. Now that the ceasefire agreement has been signed, can this battle be called a 'battle'? Having accepted its conditions first, it suddenly took advantage of it later without declaring war, using the excuse of war. What is the meaning of this? Only white bones are left to the榛莾, and red blood膏 the wilderness. The loss of the lives and property of our loyal and brave soldiers and innocent civilians cannot be counted. Even farmers have fields but cannot return to耕, and merchants have肆 but cannot resume business. Why did our solemn and brilliant Shanghai be reduced to ruins? Why did our peace-loving citizens suffer this torment? This is what we colleagues feel when we look around at the moment, and in addition to indignation, we cannot help but feel悲痛. Since order in the Shanghai-Woosung area is gradually being restored, this committee, with maintaining local order as its mission, should naturally declare its end at this point. What has happened in the past cannot be谏, and what is to come cannot be追. Combining the thoughts and talents of dozens or hundreds of people, and accumulating the experience of one hundred and twenty days, please use public opinion to list several points to正國人, so that future colleagues will know what to勉焉. (1) Any locality whose people are united in peacetime will be able to reduce many difficulties when something happens. Otherwise, when a major disaster is imminent, hastily combining may be better than nothing, but its efficiency will not be great. Therefore, to truly seek the welfare of a locality, it is necessary to strive for unity in peacetime. (2) Any organization that wants to express its ability externally must first strengthen its internal unity. In a group, the more people who are willing to屈己 for the group, the greater the efficiency of the group. This is always directly proportional. For example, in the human body, the four limbs and百官 must obey the commands of the head, and the head must issue commands based on the interests of the whole body. The principle of seeking the soundness of the organization is no different from this. (3) Do not seek to be the first to占人之先 in success, and do not dare to lag behind in taking responsibility. This is the most appropriate attitude for dealing with the world in life. The same is true for organizations. Thinking from this point of view can reduce all kinds of meaningless struggles. (4) The establishment of any group, whether it is a large country or a small local public organization, is for the sake of the masses. If they forget their responsibilities to the masses, whether they are斤斤於私人利害 or only know how to计利益 for the organization without计 for the masses, the result will inevitably be that they cannot gain the trust of a group and gradually be淘汰. (5) If the people of a country are enthusiastic about seeking the welfare of the country and doing more, then the foundation of the country will be solid. The same is true for local public organizations. Although service has a scope, it is also necessary to pay attention to the national政象 and seek to make beneficial contributions, because a part of the responsibility of local public organizations is to通 the country and the masses. All of these are within the scope of the colleagues'智慮, and I secretly wish to use them to效. This committee is responsible for the temporary, and it knows that its service to the locality is very superficial. In addition, the change was sudden, and it only seeks to slightly reduce local destruction and the suffering of the masses, but it also feels that it has not been able to do so. Today's closing meeting, I will first summarize and announce the amount of the nation-saving donations received by this committee. The general use has been announced in various Shanghai newspapers. The detailed figures of revenue and expenditure, in addition to waiting for each department to close accounts and be audited by an accountant, will be published in newspapers as appropriate, and a special booklet will be published separately. Regarding the unfinished matters of 위劳 the army, a处理 Committee for Anti-Enemy 위劳 Gold has been formed. Regarding relief matters, a处理 Committee for Relief Group Donations has been formed. These two committees must be dissolved after the responsible persons have handled them. All committee affairs will be summarized and published in a special booklet of reports and overviews for public review. Although the existence of this committee is short, the colleagues' service days are long. The eyes are still full of sores, and the pain is boundless. June 3, 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Sea Customs Cruiser Engages in Fierce Battle with Pirates</h3>
<p>Foreign Officers on the Ship Killed</p>
<p>Sailors and Petty Officers All Injured</p>
<p>The Chuentiao, a patrol boat of the Jianghai Customs in this port, is dedicated to inspecting tax-evading goods. Yesterday, the boat was cruising outside the mouth of the Woosung River, but when it reached the waters of Sheshan, it suddenly encountered a pirate ship, and a fierce battle immediately broke out. As a result, two foreign officers of the customs were killed. The details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>Patrol Boat Inspection The Jianghai Customs has four patrol boats: Zhuantiao, Meteor, Liqing, and Haising, which are dedicated to traveling to the mouth of the Woosung River and along the coast to侦察 tax-evading goods. This time, the Customs Port Affairs Office received a report that several tax-evading commercial vessels were outside the mouth of the Woosung River, secretly裝装 a large number of opium and heroin and other drugs, hoping to潜 to the mouth of the Woosung River and transfer them to Shanghai. Upon receiving the report, the巡工司 immediately ordered the patrol boat Zhuantiao to go to the outside of the mouth of the Woosung River to偵察. The Zhuantiao sailed out at 3 PM on the second day, inspecting along the way, and went straight to the waters of Sheshan before seeing a large number of cargo ships, so it went forward to inspect.</p>
<p>Searching Cargo Ships The Zhuantiao arrived in the waters of Sheshan and saw 70-80 cargo ships. The patrol boat then dropped anchor there and conducted on-site inspections. For the cargo ships going back and forth, they were all ordered to stop and wait for騐. The Zhuantiao ship, led by one foreign officer and two Chinese officers, was responsible for carrying out the search, one by one抄检, first looking at the manifests of each ship, and then checking the cargo holds and engine rooms, which was quite thorough, in order to prevent privately transported drugs from 혼过 and flowing into Shanghai.</p>
<p>Chasing a Boat and Encountering Pirates When inspecting, several boats suddenly disobeyed the patrol boat's order to wait for inspection and sailed away on their own. At that time, the Zhuantiao boat raised a flag warning them to stop, but the boats ignored it and sailed as before. The Zhuantiao boat then opened full horsepower and went forward to chase, guessing that there might be drugs in the boats. After chasing about two nautical miles, they were able to catch up. The second mate of the boat, Kenaier, boarded the ship, ordered the manifest to be shown, and then sent two Chinese officers into the cabin to抄查 whether there were any drugs. Unexpectedly, the bandits on the ship, who were伏 in the cabin, immediately raised their guns and乱击 at the Zhuantiao ship, which led to the tragedy.</p>
<p>Naval Ship in Combat Several pirates shot at the Zhuantiao ship with water guns and关枪 on the boat, while at the same time, the pirates in the front cabin and the stern also乱放 at the inspection personnel with wooden shell guns. At this time, the first mate Kenaier saw that the situation was not good and quickly ordered several sailors to take rifles and machine guns to还击 and resist bravely. Kenaier was shot in the chest and died on the塲. At the same time, the second mate, a Chinese, and the chief sailor, a Chinese, were also shot and fell to the boat immediately. In addition, three other sailors were seriously injured.</p>
<p>Haising Going to Help When the incident occurred, the ship immediately sent a wireless telegraph to the Jianghai Customs to report. Upon receiving the report, the巡工司 immediately ordered the large patrol boat Haising to open full speed and fly to the waters of Sheshan to help rescue and help剿匪. Unexpectedly, after the pirate ship had shot and killed the foreign officer of the Zhuantiao, it took advantage of the fog on the sea and潜行逃走. The Zhuantiao chased closely behind, even冒重雾. The injured Chinese officers were first transferred back to Shanghai by the Haising ship. They arrived at the customs wharf at 3:15 AM this morning. The Customs hurriedly sent Dr. Sun Mengping to the ship to provide emergency treatment, and then transferred the injured to the hospital.</p>
<p>Cooperation in剿追 The Zhuantiao boat has already returned to Shanghai yesterday, and the body of the deceased foreign officer has also been transported back to Shanghai. After this incident, the naval authorities in this port have協謀 with the water police and the customs authorities to会同剿灭. The discovery of a large number of pirates at the mouth of the Woosung River has a significant impact on the safety of shipping and travel.</p>
<p>Sailor Dies The sailor rescued by Haising was sent to Renji Hospital by a car sent by the Xinzha Fire Brigade at the time. The sailor, Miao Fu, 41 years old, was wounded in the large abdomen and back. He died at 1:50 yesterday due to serious injuries. Li Binglai, 21 years old, was injured in the thigh, and the bone had been broken by bullets. Luo Ziheng, 31 years old, was injured in the large abdomen and shoulder and is still under treatment.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhutong and Others Inspect Woosung-Paoshan</h3>
<p>Heartbreaking and Tragic</p>
<p>Yesterday (3rd) morning, Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Gu Zhutong, accompanied by Civil Affairs Director Zhao Qilu, Construction Director Dong Xiujia, Provincial Government Committee Member Han Deqin, Security Director Li Mingyang, War Zone Relief Committee Investigation Team Director Zhao Zhengping, and gentry from Zhabei-Paoshan Wang Binyan, Hong Lanxiang, Dong Mengyi, Wu Xuen, Ling Zhibin, etc., set off by car for inspection. They first went to the area of Zhabei passing Paoshan Road-Qiujiang Road, turned into Shuibian Road, passed Zha Yin Road and arrived at Woosung. Wherever they encountered the most severe destruction along the way, they stopped to inspect in detail. At noon, they arrived at Paoshan County Seat, entered the county government for a short rest. Paoshan urban area is not large, and the streets are also narrow. After the residents' 刼, their vitality has not recovered, and the market is desolate. In front of the county government courtyard, there is an ancient rattan, an ancient relic of hundreds of years, which was also damaged after the riot. Soon, representatives of various groups in the county seat and heads of various institutions came to pay their respects one after another, and personally handed over the investigation and statistics tables of the disaster-stricken townships and towns in the first district of Paoshan. Chairman Gu and Director Zhao received them, consulted in detail. After lunch, they went out to勘 Paoshan Seawall, walked out of the North Gate and登塘周視. Today is a small flood, the tide is calm and the water is quiet, and the wooden stakes can be seen clearly. According to legend, during the big flood, the tidal waves hit hard, and the embankment body was hit into holes as deep as丈餘. The embankment work is extremely necessary. After the inspection, they went to Fort Paotai, ascended the fort. About twenty cannons were all destroyed. Where the bombs fell, they were陷 as deep ponds, some up to two丈餘. The architecture of the fort is extremely 整, but now it is ruined with broken stones and foundations, and the scene is纵横. From Fort Paotai to Woosung, a city of shops, turned into rubble. Many residents set up thatched huts and established small肆 for a living. From Woosung to Jiangwan, the destruction of Jiangwan was no less than that of Woosung and Paoshan Road. Walking from the rubble to the local public security bureau, the place where the Jiangwan institutions gathered, only the fire station small building remained in its original state, and the rest were broken and the walls collapsed, unidentifiable. There are two pieces of stairs, high on the roof, said to have been broken and横飞 to this place after being炸. After detailed inspection, they took the original car back to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>June 3rd Commemoration Assembly</h3>
<p>The China National Anti-Drug Association held the 93rd Anniversary Commemoration Meeting of Lin Zexu's Destruction of Opium yesterday morning at 10 AM. Attendees included committee members, section directors, and representatives of various groups of the association. The ceremony was extremely grand. First, the vice chairman of the association respectfully read the Prime Minister's遺訓 and announced the purpose of the meeting, briefly stating that Lin Wenzhonggong's destruction of opium was a manifestation of the fearless spirit of our country's officials. His determination to defend the country and the people is truly worthy of admiration. Looking back at today's government, it surrenders to everything externally, only listening to the orders of foreigners. Internally, it殘民以逞, indulges in banning smoke in order to make huge profits. Who can surpass this? Where can we find someone like Lin Wenzhonggong who rises up to petition for the people? We, the蒿目時艱, are deeply concerned and burning with anxiety. We cannot help but feel感慨繫之 about today's commemoration. All of us anti-drug comrades and patriotic compatriots should regard ourselves as today's Lin Gong, unite and rise up to continue Lin Gong's unfinished aspirations, so that today's commemoration will not be in vain. Then, Dr. Wang Jingqi, as a representative, read the speech sent by Chairman Wang from Beijing, which generally stated that today we commemorate Lin Zexu's destruction of opium. Looking back at the prevalence of opium in the country, we, for the sake of the world, the nation, and the country, should continue Lin Gong's spirit and think about how to杜絕 it. Today, the anti-smoking issue is a world issue, not just a national or ethnic issue. All of us comrades should be sincere and diligent, and work together to find ways to resist it. We have the sympathy of the world, the assistance of the international community, the greatness of the cause, and the superiority of the opportunity, all of which are superior. All of us comrades, let's興乎來 to continue the legacy of our national martyr Lin Wenzhonggong. Those who are addicted to drugs, plant tobacco, and sell soil should especially猛省, and quickly脱迷津, so that the future June 3rd will become a day of commemoration for the success of anti-drug efforts. Later, the general director of the association, Huang Jiajie, reported on the progress and achievements of the most告会务, and the process of opposing the public sale of opium in various provinces.

<p>Continue to Visit Liuhang and Other Places Today</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the discussion of the reconstruction plan of the war zone, the members of the Shanghai War Zone Rehabilitation Committee set off on the first day of this month to visit the areas of Zhenru, Zhabei, and Jiangwan. Yesterday, they continued to visit six places in Yanghang, Lion Forest, Paoshan, Fort Paotai, Woosung, and the downtown area. They will inspect for another day tomorrow, and the inspection will be completed. The details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection Personnel The inspectors included committee members Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Peihuang, Tang Chengzong, Wang Zengyou, Shen Youshen, Chen Guangfu, Wu Xuen, Zhou Nianzu, Hong Lanxiang (Hong Qianxiang 代), and representatives from the City Chamber of Commerce Zheng Chengqing, Fan Yongzeng, the third chief section of the City Land Bureau, and Cha Nanqiang and Tao Xiaojie, special commissioners of the 接管 Committee, about 20 people. Local Conditions At about 9 AM yesterday morning, the members gathered at the联社 接管 Committee. At 9:30 AM, they set off in four cars, passing Zhabei through Hengfeng Bridge, along the Shanghai-Taicang bus station, passing Dajiaochang and Liuhang, and arriving in Yanghang at 10:40 AM. They stopped the car and entered the town for inspection. There are about 600 households in the town, with a population of over 1,000. The loss is not very serious, accounting for about one-tenth of the total population. Residents have now all returned. When the Japanese soldiers moved in, the traitors Zhang Jingnian and Wu Mou, etc., also organized a maintenance committee. They listened to the Japanese instructions and investigated the town's population in great detail. Each household had a name list pasted on the door. At about 11 AM, they left Yanghang Town and went to Paoshan County. At 11:20 AM, they entered the city through the South Gate of Paoshan and planned to exit the North Gate and go straight to the Lion Forest. However, because the streets of Paoshan were narrow and the public bus could not pass, all the inspection personnel could not同行. Only committee members Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Xu Peihuang, Shen Tianxin, and Land Bureau representative Fan Yongzeng and other people went. The car traveled with great difficulty due to the muddy road after the rain. It took an hour and a half to reach the destination. After inspecting for about ten minutes, the nearby villages did not have any losses. Only two teahouses were set on fire by the Japanese because they did not dare to open for business. The artillery fort has been completely destroyed. In addition to stealing all the machinery, the Japanese also destroyed the twelve cannons by pouring nitric acid into the gun mouths. It was a pity. It was not until 2:45 PM that they returned to Paoshan County to have lunch. At 3:30 PM, they went to Fort Paotai in Woosung. Guided by Woosung Municipal Committee Member Tang Chengzong, they first went to the Garrison Battalion of the Fortress. All the barracks there were destroyed by bombing. Then, they went to inspect the fortresses of the fortress on the river. The loss there was very serious. All the artillery forts were destroyed. According to those with military knowledge, the bombs dropped by the Japanese there were at least 300 pounds or more. Although the cannons were not destroyed by the bombs, they had also been dismantled by the Japanese. It was a pity. In addition, several smaller cannons were stolen and transported away by the Japanese. At about 5 PM, they went to Woosung Town. Because it was late, they briefly rested at the office of the Woosung Municipal Committee Member, had some tea and water, and then passed through Jungong Road and Wuquan Road through the downtown area back to the port. It was already 6:30 PM when they arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Today's Inspection Today, the committee members will go to inspect five places in Liuhang, Luodian, Jiading, Liuhang, and Dajiaochang. The meeting place and departure time will remain the same. It is also准定 to have lunch at the Jiading County Government.</p>
<h3>接管 Committee Entertained the Press Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Withdrawal Area 接管 Committee entertained the press on the ninth floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge yesterday afternoon. More than fifty reporters from various newspapers were present. Halfway through the wine, Chairman Yin Rugeng stood up and said briefly that since the 协定 was signed on May 5, the Japanese began to withdraw on the next day, and the handover has been completed in order, which will be a month. Although the Japanese side has obstructed it, the 接管 of our side has been handled properly, so no major incidents have occurred. The comrades of the press have traveled to all directions and worked very hard. The committee expressed its deep gratitude, etc. Then the press publicly elected Zhao Shuyong to give a reply. The meeting ended happily at about 2 PM.</p>
<h3>Formal Opening of the Songhu Line Today</h3>

<p>Since the Zhanghuabang locomotive depot on the Songhu Line was repaired, the Railway Bureau has been actively planning for its restoration. Now, the line is scheduled to officially open today, starting from Baoshan Road Station and ending at Yunzaobang Station.

What more can be said? For this reason, our association has decided to hold a memorial service for the martyrs of the Northeast Songhu Anti-Japanese War at 10:00 AM on the 12th of this month at the Ximen Public Sports Field.

At that time, we hope that you will prepare elegiac couplets and wreaths, organize your team and come to participate, to comfort the spirits of the martyred heroes in heaven, and to continue the spirit of the anti-Japanese martyred heroes, and jointly discuss anti-Japanese salvation of the country. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<h3>China Branch of the International Chamber of Commerce Seeks Members</h3>
<p>Letter to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce</p>
<p>Yesterday, the National Branch of the International Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, stating: We hereby inform you that in November of the 17th year of the Republic of China, A. Piull, the President of the International Chamber of Commerce (in Paris, France), entrusted Wang Jingqi, the Chinese Minister to Belgium, to forward a request to the Chinese business community to join the association. Minister Wang immediately sent a letter to the former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, instructing them to implement it. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce forwarded the letter to your association, and we are grateful that your association held a meeting to discuss and resolve to participate. A letter was sent to Minister Wang to be forwarded to the President of the International Chamber of Commerce for verification. Liang Long, Secretary of the Chinese Embassy in Germany, and Mr. Xia Qifeng were appointed as representatives to attend the China Problem Research Conference held in Paris on January 26, 18, and to organize and participate in the China Research Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce to discuss all ongoing matters. It was also resolved to establish a China Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce and to send representatives and specialized commissioners to attend the Fifth Congress held in Amsterdam, Netherlands. As for the funding, it was resolved that the annual fee would be 20,000 yuan per year, and the congress fee would be 60,000 yuan every year of the congress. Half of the amount would be subsidized by the government, and the other half would be raised by your association from chambers of commerce across the country. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan approved the allocation of 30,000 yuan in congress fees by the Ministry of Finance, and Zhang Jia'ao (Gong Quan), Chen Huide (Guangfu), Zhu Dechuan (Yinjiang), Guo Bingwen, Liang Long, Xia Qifeng, Shi Youming, Zhang Xianglin, Wang Shinai, and Shou Liangwei were appointed as representatives, and Zhao Tiezhang, Zhang Yuelian, and Yu Dawei were appointed as specialized commissioners to attend the Fifth Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce in the Netherlands. In February of the 19th year, our association was established in Shanghai, with Chen Guangfu as Chairman, Guo Bingwen as Vice Chairman, and Lin Kanghou as Secretary-General, and reported to the International Chamber of Commerce. In early May of the same year, the International Chamber of Commerce held its Sixth Congress in Washington, D.C., and Bei Songsun, Guo Bingwen, and Li Guoqin were appointed as representatives of our association to attend. Reports were made at the above two congresses, and there was a special publication on the silver price issue. This is the history of our participation in the International Chamber of Commerce and the organization of our association. Subsequently, due to the unstable situation, the solicitation of members, the election of directors, and other matters that should have been carried out have not yet been held. However, in today's era, commercial issues are of great international importance. If we want to develop, we should immediately improve the organization of our association so that we can compete with others. Your association took the lead in initiating our association, and will surely support its improvement in the future. Therefore, we have specially included the draft charter and application form and sent a letter to your association, requesting that you send a circular to chambers of commerce across the country to encourage them to participate enthusiastically. This is our earnest prayer. To the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, China Branch of the International Chamber of Commerce.</p>

I deeply regret your departure from Shanghai, and I can only wish you all the best in the future.</p>
<h3>An Changhao Has Been Sent Back to Korea</h3>
<p>He Will Not Be Allowed to Come to China Again in the Future</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that after the Hongkou bombing on April 29th, An Changhao, the leader of the Korean Revolution, was also arrested in the French Concession. It is learned that Mr. An was secretly sent back to Korea by the Japanese authorities yesterday morning (2nd). At that time, for fear that Korean residents might cause another incident, it was kept very secret beforehand. He was taken from the consulate prison by the Japanese Navy, escorted onto a certain ship, and soldiers were sent to escort him along the way. It is expected that after arriving in Korea, he will be prosecuted for violating the Korean Public Security Law. According to Aleman, the lawyer hired by his family, Mr. An may be convicted or may be acquitted according to the Public Security Law, but in any case, he will never be allowed to come to China again. It is said that Mr. An's arrest this time was mainly due to ordinary reasons, and his relationship with the Hongkou bombing was minimal, whether directly or indirectly. Japanese officials also admitted that Mr. An has always been a law-abiding citizen. It is also learned that when the authorities were investigating the case, Mr. An had a naturalization certificate issued by the Chinese government in July of the 12th year of the Republic of China, and Mr. An also claimed that he had never registered as a Japanese or Korean citizen. However, his certificate of naturalization in China was copied and taken away from his home by the Japanese authorities after his arrest. Although the Japanese authorities first returned it to Aleman, they soon changed their mind and refused to return it. According to the Japanese, according to Japanese law, all Japanese subjects must register with the relevant authorities. Mr. An was accused of not registering, so he should be sent back to Korea for interrogation.</p>

<h3>The Inland Tap Water Company Completes All Improvement Works</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Inland Tap Water Company, due to the old reservoir, poor water output, and insufficient pressure from the water pump driven by the water pavilion, users were often worried about lack of water. Therefore, since the 17th year of the Republic of China, the water plant has been greatly improved, such as adding fast-acting filter pools, abolishing water pavilions, replacing them with electric water pumps, increasing pressure, adding large-diameter trunk pipes, and installing water meters, doing its best to renovate without sparing any effort. For three years, all has been completed, but the construction cost has increased by more than 2 million yuan. In order to facilitate the supervision and command of the water plant, the company will move its office on Zhonghua Road to the Bansongyuan Road water plant on June 10th, merging the offices to unify authority, and has reported to the authorities for implementation.</p>
<h3>French Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association Opposes Water and Electricity Price Increases</h3>
<p>The French Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association, because it has been repeatedly reported that the French water and electricity company has plans to increase prices, and according to the requests of the citizens in the concession, it has raised objections. The association sent a letter to the French Public Works Bureau and all Chinese directors yesterday, so that they could refute it when the Public Works Bureau held a meeting. The original letter is extracted as follows: We hereby inform you that we have recently seen reports that the French water and electricity company has plans to increase water and electricity prices, which has caused citizens to inquire about this association. Although it is a rumor, it is not without cause. The original water and electricity prices set by the French water and electricity company were more expensive than those in the Public Concession. The reason was that the French Concession had not yet been promoted at that time, and the market was not as prosperous as it is now. Its business volume was less than one-third of what it is now. In recent years, the population of the French Concession has increased sharply, and the market has become more prosperous. The company's business has developed several times more than before. The previously set high prices should be reasonably reduced to be fair. If it is a unique business and only seeks to make profits, without comparing with neighboring concessions and without considering the burden on citizens, it is contrary to the principle of public utilities. On the part of your Public Works Bureau, you should order the company to improve it to benefit the people's livelihood. Now, according to the previous reasons, we hereby send a letter to your Public Works Bureau for investigation. Please immediately reject the company if it requests or proposes to increase water and electricity fees. The letter to all Chinese directors is roughly the same (omitted).</p>
<h3>Taxpaying Association Sends Another Letter to the Public Works Bureau Regarding Tap Water</h3>
<p>The company is unpredictable, making it impossible to figure out</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Public Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association sent another letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau regarding the issue of tap water price increases, stating: We hereby inform you that we have received your letter of May 26th, which is filed as No. 1408. We have learned that this association is closely concerned about the issue of tap water because it is a public utility and monopoly, and tap water has become an irreplaceable product, and its relationship with residents' lives, public health, and fire prevention is very close. This is the same as your bureau. Therefore, the letters to your bureau are more important and courteous than other matters, and there is no empty or unfounded statement in the writing or in the mind. Your bureau takes the principle of seeking the interests of taxpayers as its principle, and the words and deeds of this association have never deviated from this principle. The above is an explanation of what your bureau hopes from this association. Please do not regard it as an empty or unfounded statement. As for the water price, this association has seen it on the contract published in the Gazette. The blank contract of the British Shanghai Tap Water Company only lists item B. The water price listed is only for item B: For water consumption within the house not exceeding 200,000 gallons per month, the charge is 6 jiao 2 fen and 5 li per 1,000 gallons, up to the last item. The two and a half inch meter and other three items above it, as well as items C and D, are not included. This should be a question for your bureau to inquire about the reason. According to Mr. He Lihua's report, after the protest, the water company immediately cancelled the original proposal of a minimum price of 6 yuan 2 jiao and 5 fen per month and changed it to still calculating according to the rent. It is really unpredictable. What is the meaning of harmony? Mr. He Lihua lives at No. 540 Baker Road and this is reported together. In short, the contract signed on December 24, 1931 is full of obstacles. First, the water price is too high. Second, the meter installation procedure is too heavy. It is customary to publish a draft contract and let people criticize it, and solicit public opinion, so that the current dispute can at least be avoided a lot. It is a good thing to send representatives to meet in person, but in the opinion of this association, it is easier to investigate by exchanging letters. A corresponding letter is sent, hoping you will check it out.</p>
<h3>Telephone Price Increase Issue</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Has Submitted It to the Board of Directors</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Public Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association forwarded the Public Works Bureau's reply to the Office of the Hongkou District Branch of the Citizens' Federation regarding the telephone price increase, stating: We hereby inform you that regarding the telephone price increase case, the Public Concession Public Works Bureau replied, "We have received your letter of May 26th regarding the implementation of the new telephone price regulations. The telephone company's renovation of the automatic machine is about to be completed, and the bureau believes that its handling is satisfactory. According to Article 13 of the contract signed on August 5, 1930, after the automatic machine is installed, the bureau and the company should negotiate a new price regulation according to the standards specified in the article. Your opinion is that it is not appropriate to increase prices during this period and will be submitted to the directors for consideration." A corresponding letter is sent, hoping you will check it out.</p>
<h3>Pudong Electric Company Expands Lines</h3>
<p>To Sanlintang, Shanghai County</p>
<p>The Pudong Electric Company has been expanding its lines year after year and has been laid to the important towns under the jurisdiction of Shanghai City. Recently, it has extended the pole line from Yangsi Bridge to Sanlintang Town under the jurisdiction of Shanghai County, and has obtained a report from the Municipal Public Works Bureau. Construction will start soon, and electricity will be available within this month.</p>
<h3>Finance and Public Utilities Bureaus Jointly Announce the Restoration of Chejuan in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Finance and Public Utilities Bureaus issued a joint announcement, stating: Announcement for joint announcement, investigation of the Zhabei war zone, which has now been received one after another. The Shanghai North Motor Vehicle Office of this Public Utilities Bureau is still at the original address on Minli Road. The Municipal North Collection Office of this Finance Bureau has moved to the intersection of Datong Road and Xinjiang Road. Both are scheduled to open on June 1st. All business rickshaws, trucks, small cars, etc. in the North City area, who have stopped donating due to the war, must bring the vehicle licenses originally issued by this Public Utilities Bureau from June 1st and go to the Municipal North Collection Office to pay the June vehicle donation for verification. Vehicles that have been donated and driven in the Municipal South Collection Office during the war period should still go through the formalities in Zhabei in the future. As for self-owned rickshaws that pay donations on a quarterly basis, the summer vehicle donation will only collect one month's donation for June (i.e., one-third of a quarter) to show fairness. In addition to being submitted to the Municipal Government for approval by this Finance Bureau and ordered separately, a joint announcement is made for general knowledge. This announcement, June 2, 21st year of the Republic of China, Bureau Chief Huang Boqiao · Cai Zengji.</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the Public Works Bureau Board of Directors Meeting</h3>
<p>Wednesday, June 1st, the Public Works Bureau Board of Directors resolved the following matters: The Chamber of Commerce will increase the Philippine team. The Police Committee recommended recruiting American Filipinos to form an infantry team, which is named the Philippine team. This case has been approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Assessment of the house tax of the East China Electric Plant. The Finance Committee recently discussed the appeal of the East China Electric Company against the assessment of the house tax valuation committee of 500 taels per month. Representatives of the company attended the last committee meeting. Because the committee still had some questions, it waited for the report of the valuation committee. The report has now been sent, and the Finance Committee resolved that the value of the company's house at No. 131 Zhoujiazui Road is assessed at 500 taels per month. This assessment has now been approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The Dahua Land Road Construction Plan. The Dahua Consortium recently reported to the Public Works Bureau that the house on Land Certificate No. 2940 will be demolished and divided into several smaller plots, and it intends to dedicate 7.317 acres of land to the Public Works Bureau for the construction of intersecting roads and maintenance by the Public Works Bureau. The Director of Public Works suggested that if the road width is no less than 40 feet and the consortium returns two-thirds of the actual cost of road construction (approximately 21,500 taels), the Public Works Bureau will be responsible for the construction and maintenance and patrol responsibilities in the future. The Director of Public Works stated in the Public Works Committee that this road was not in the plan, but it is necessary for the development of the land, and the landowner must bear two-thirds of the road construction cost, etc., which is based on item C of Article 6 of the Property Regulations. The landowner can therefore avoid the responsibility of future maintenance and patrol, so the committee believes that it can be handled as agreed and notified the consortium. This case has now been approved by the Public Works Bureau Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Wing On Company Requests to Build an Overpass. According to the request of Mr. Herzog, representative of Wing On Company, two overpasses, one single and one double, will be built on both sides of Zhejiang Road between the company's old and new houses. The distance from the ground is 57 feet and 69 feet respectively. The new house will be built with seven floors. The overpass is for the convenience of customers. The Director of Public Works believes that if the conditions he stated are followed, the request can be approved. The Chief of Police and the Fire Chief have also agreed. This case was deemed feasible by the Public Works Committee and has now been approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Renji Hospital Requests Additional Subsidies. The Board of Directors of Renji Hospital petitioned the Public Works Bureau, stating that it had increased special expenses during the war and requested an additional subsidy of 15,850 yuan and 3 jiao, including 4.562 yuan and 8 jiao and 1 fen for the transfer of patients from the patrol hospital, which has been approved. The Director of Finance stated in the Finance Committee that the hospital already has an annual subsidy of 20,000 taels. The impact of the increased expenses during the emergency period on the hospital's expenses this year should be investigated. The committee then suggested that the hospital's request for increased medical expenses for injured civilians should be discussed when the hospital reports its accounts for this year. This suggestion has been approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Bidding Can Be Held in London. The Public Works Bureau's London manager requested that the resolution of 1927, that is, bidding in Shanghai, should be revoked because the office cannot bid. The Director-General of the Public Works Bureau stated that according to the Director of Finance, the Public Works Bureau should purchase from the cheapest market, so the Finance Committee recommended that the previous case be cancelled, that is, the London Manager's Office should also have the opportunity to bid on items bid locally in the future. This case has now been approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<h3>Dong Xiujia Talks About the Three-Year Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Speech on the Guohua Radio Station</p>
<p>Dong Xiujia, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, came to Shanghai a few days ago to inspect the disaster situation in Jiabao counties. He gave a speech on the current situation and future plans for construction in Jiangsu Province at the invitation of Guohua Radio Station, saying that the training period set by the Central Executive Committee is six years, and half of it has passed. Therefore, all construction projects in Jiangsu Province must be completed quickly within three years. However, since the deadline is tight and the economy is extremely poor, the difficulty of carrying out the work is self-evident. However, I will definitely work hard and strive not to disappoint the government and the public's expectations. I specially supervise the responsible personnel of the department to first formulate a concrete three-year construction plan, and then weigh its importance and carry it out in order. Among these plans, water conservancy is the most important. If water conservancy is not managed, not only will the people not have a happy life, but it will also harm agriculture. China has always been known as a country founded on agriculture, and the prosperity of agriculture in Jiangsu Province is even higher than in other provinces. Therefore, when talking about construction, we must first plan for the development of agriculture. If we want the development of agriculture to be unimpeded, we must make the most of water. In addition, such as adding highways to facilitate transportation, promoting various electrical undertakings to transmit news, and improving provincial and county municipalities to prosper merchants, are also in the detailed planning list. If there are no major natural or man-made disasters in the next three years, the construction of Jiangsu Province will definitely have considerable results.</p>

<h3>Robbers Rob Egg Shop</h3>
<p>Police Bravely Pursue and Arrest</p>
<p>Three Robbers Caught on the Spot</p>
<p>Around 7 PM the night before last, four robbers suddenly arrived at the Fengmao Egg Shop at the Yongsheng Wharf in the Nanshi area. While they were committing the robbery, the police chief of the responsible First District Police Station heard the news and rushed to the scene. The robbers opened fire to resist arrest, injuring one police officer. Three robbers were caught on the spot. The details are recorded below: Wang Heshang, a 57-year-old man from Yin County, has been running the Fengmao Egg Shop at No. 4, Lane 27, Yongsheng Wharf, Nanshi for over twenty years. His business has been quite prosperous. Around 7 PM the night before last, after Wang finished his dinner, he was settling accounts in the accounting room when four robbers suddenly arrived. After entering, they pretended to buy eggs and barged into the accounting room. Two of the robbers took out pistols from their sleeves, threatening them to keep quiet. One of the robbers with a pockmarked face guarded the door. Wang, realizing he had encountered robbers, was extremely alarmed and handed over all the sixty yuan in banknotes and silver dollars he had on him to the two robbers with both hands, saying, "If you want money, take it all. Please don't shoot." One of the robbers took the money and put it in his pocket. They then opened the account box and robbed more than eighty yuan in banknotes and silver dollars, and a check for 180 yuan in total. Still not satisfied, they swarmed upstairs, intending to search again. At that time, Liu Wende, a shop assistant, had already noticed the robbers downstairs. He quickly crossed the wall and rushed to the Zhi Da Xianyu (Big Salted Fish) shop next door and used the telephone to report to the First District Police Station, requesting police to arrest them. The police chief, upon hearing the report, immediately led Inspector Mu Chengjin, along with police officers Lu Yongchang, Tang Shaoqing, Zhang Guimao, Duan Jingming, etc., to the location. They surrounded the Fengmao Egg Shop. Police officer Lu Yongchang pushed open the front door first. At that moment, a person (the pockmarked robber) suddenly rushed out from beside the door and grabbed Officer Lu, forcing him not to make a sound (because Officer Lu was wearing plain clothes). Officer Lu, knowing he must be a robber, took out his pistol and showed it to the robber, saying, "I am a police officer. Who are you?" The robber, seeing this, instantly turned pale and falsely claimed to be a shop assistant here. The police officer did not argue with him, immediately dragged the robber out and handcuffed him. At that time, the three robbers who were rummaging through boxes and chests upstairs had noticed that the situation downstairs was not good. They immediately climbed to the roof and opened fire to resist arrest. The sound of gunfire was heard far and wide, and people, not understanding the truth, were all panicked. At that time, police officer Zhang Guimao was shot in the right arm by a bullet in the street, which went straight through, causing injury and bleeding. He was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment by car. Police officer Tang Shaoqing, seeing the robbers climbing onto the roof, also bravely climbed up to the roof. Because it was night and the sky was dark, one could not see one's fingers. He used a flashlight to shine on the roof, and saw two robbers lying prone between the roof ridges. Seen under the flashlight, Tang saw the robbers were about to resist. Tang, seeing this, preemptively took out his pistol and fired multiple shots into the air. The robbers then curled up and did not move. Tang immediately took a stride forward, grabbed one robber with each hand, and captured both robbers. He called Police Officer Duan Jingming and others to come up to the roof and brought the two robbers down and tied them up. They also searched the roof all around, and found a fake pistol and a bayonet. However, one robber was missing. The three robbers were taken back to the police station. During the preliminary hearing, the victim Wang Heshang first stated the circumstances of the robbery and identified the three captured robbers as the robbers who committed the robbery on the spot, requesting punishment. The pockmarked robber confessed his name was Zhou Agen, 24 years old, from Shaoxing, also known as Ding Amao, nicknamed "Little Pockface." People call me "Uncle Agen." Xu Changfu runs the Yongtai Musical Instrument Shop at No. 137 next to the City God Temple. I work in that shop. The two people brought to justice, Cao Hongsheng, is my fellow apprentice, and Xue Laosan. This morning, Mr. and Mrs. Qian proposed to rob the Fengmao Egg Shop. Then Xu Agen, Cao Hongsheng, Xue Laosan and I, four people, gathered in the French Concession and came to Nanshi to commit the crime. Xu brought a pistol, Xue Laosan only held a fake pistol, and now Xu has escaped, etc. When questioned, Cao Hongsheng confessed that he was 27 years old, from Tongzhou. Xue Laosan confessed that he was 29 years old, from Dongtai, residing at No. 3 1/2, Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession. The rest of his confession was the same as Zhou's. Sixty yuan in stolen money, a check, and a fake beard were found on Zhou. Detectives were then dispatched to Yongtai in the City God Temple, where a suspect named Li Meiting was arrested. After being brought back, because the matter involved a robbery case, he was ordered to prepare a document and submit it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation at around 7 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Large Quantity of Smuggled Military Supplies Seized on Mail Steamer</h3>
<p>Witnesses and Evidence Handed Over to Public Security Bureau for Interrogation</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1 PM, a certain mail steamer of a certain country entered the port and dropped anchor off the Bund of the China Merchants Bureau Wharf, north of the Sixteenth Pier. Wang Jiheng, a member of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, suddenly received a secret report from an informant that the mail steamer was privately loaded with a large amount of military supplies. He immediately went to the Water Patrol Team for assistance and inspection. Chief Liang immediately dispatched Inspector Li Wenhan and investigator Jiao Ying to the location, and together with Inspector Zhao Bingkui of the First Squad and others, waited for a long time beside the mail steamer. They saw the ship's crew members carrying a large number of firearms onto the deck, intending to transport them elsewhere. The police officers swarmed aboard and searched the mail steamer, seizing 26 pistols and 2,900 rounds of ammunition. They also took the ship's crew members, Ningbo residents Xu Jingda, Fang Jiamao, Xie Zaili, Zhang Genfa, and Pudong resident Qian Along, back to the team. After a preliminary hearing by Chief Liang, he ordered the preparation of a document along with the seized evidence and the submission of the case to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation due to the smuggling of a large quantity of military supplies.</p>
<h3>Xunpu Bureau River Robbery Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Verdict to be Announced on the 8th of This Month</p>
<p>The Xunpu Bureau's Lifly Ferry was robbed of its wages by bandits in the Huangpu River the year before last, resulting in the shooting deaths of two Chinese and foreign engineers and injuries to many others. The criminals Zhang Genbao and Feng Qing were apprehended and sentenced to death by the local court. Subsequently, the detective team apprehended Zhang Changsheng, Yao Jinxiang, and Zhang Sanjie (Li Zhangshi). A live ammunition pistol was found at Zhang's residence, and it was discovered that the defendants were planning to rob Zhang's home on Route Lafayette in the French Concession. They were immediately sent to the local court and prosecuted under the law for punishing bandits. Yesterday morning, Judge Shi Zhiqun opened the trial. Zhang Changsheng claimed that in 1927 he worked as a machinist at the Chao County rice mill and did not go home. Because Yao Jinxiang borrowed 50 yuan from me, I asked him to return it. Li Zhangshi went and arranged for Yao to meet at Zhang San's house, because he borrowed money from Zhang San to repay the debt. As for the pistol, it was given to me by Li Xibao. Because it was in a paper bag, I didn't know. The Xunpu Bureau robbery case is a complete injustice. Yao Jinxiang confessed that I owed Zhang Changsheng 50 yuan, which I borrowed in February 1930. The rest of his statement was the same, but the date of the loan and the date in Shanghai were not entirely consistent. Li Zhangshi claimed that it was completely unfair. At this point, Prosecutor Yang Qi's opinion was that the defendants in this case committed the crime of robbery, and the facts are very clear, and requested a verdict. Defendant's defense lawyer Hu Yuanjun argued that regarding the Lifly Ferry robbery, the victims completely arrived in court and individually identified them, not only did they not recognize the three defendants, but they also said that there were no female robbers at the time. As for the robbery of Zhang San, it did not become a fact, and Zhang San was an acquaintance, not wealthy, so it should not be relied upon. Among these three defendants, only Zhang Changsheng is guilty of possessing firearms, and the others are innocent of the banditry charges. At this point, the judge announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the 8th of this month.</p>
<h3>Lu Shaotang Kidnapping Case Further Trial</h3>
<p>Li Changyuan Raged Wildly</p>
<p>Sun Li Shi Cried Loudly</p>
<p>Adjourned to Summon Witnesses for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Lu Shaotang, comprador of the Fairey-Queen Company, was kidnapped by bandits on Yunnan Road on December 18 of the year before last. Subsequently, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui and detectives Tang Jian and Liu Shaokui of the General Inspection Office arrested the ringleader of the kidnapping, Shuai Songping, and more than ten accomplices. They were sent to the First Special District Court. After interrogation, Shuai was executed, and the others were sentenced to death or imprisonment. In October of last year, the investigating detective went to the Tianjin Public Security Bureau to bring back accomplices Li Changyuan, Sun Jinsheng, Jin Li Shi, and Sun Li Shi, all from Tianjin. After questioning by a court, they all denied the charges and were sent back to prison. Jin Li Shi has since died of illness. The case was originally presided over by Xu Jiashi, the head of the criminal court, but Mr. Xu has now resigned. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong came to the court to continue the trial. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated the case and claimed that defendant Li Changyuan was identified by Hu Mingde and Liu Dianqing, who had already been sentenced to imprisonment, as being present during the kidnapping of Lu Shaotang and guarding the hostage afterwards. Chen Jinsheng was the driver, and Sun Li Shi was one of the guards. The defendants all confessed to Tang Jian, a Chinese detective, at the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, which Tang can prove. According to Detective Tang, when he went to the Tianjin Public Security Bureau to transfer the defendants, they all admitted it to the bureau. Li Changyuan, upon hearing this, raged wildly, saying that he did not admit it at the time and that he did not know Hu Mingde, etc. Sun Jinsheng confessed that he was not the driver when Lu Shaotang was kidnapped. Later, Shuai Songping told him that a kidnapping case had occurred and gave him 50 yuan to return to Tianjin. Sun Li Shi confessed that she knew nothing about the kidnapping case and cried loudly, kneeling and begging for judgment. Judge Shen ordered them to be separately returned to prison and adjourned the trial to summon witnesses to verify the case.</p>

<h3>The First Sound of the Newly Reopened New Central</h3>
<p>The New Central Grand Theater at the intersection of Haining Road and North Sichuan Road was once suspended due to the impact of the war. Now, as the Hongkou area is gradually recovering, the theater has been greatly renovated and has invested heavily in a sound film projector to exclusively screen famous sound films from China and abroad. June 1st was the first day of its reopening, and the first sound film with sound from the Mingxing Company, "Old Times in Jinghua," was screened. When this film was first shown simultaneously in the Central and Mingxing theaters, it was very crowded, and there were many who were unable to get tickets. This time, the New Central is offering very low prices to residents of northern Shanghai, divided into three types: three jiao, four jiao, and six jiao, uniformly day and night. Children are only sold at two jiao, three jiao.</p>

Mr. Zhang was originally scheduled to return to his native Zhili after performing at the Summer Pavilion and begin to organize a circus troupe. Now, due to the repeated retention of Mr. Zhang's close friends, he has agreed to perform at the Central Grand Theater on Six Ma Road for three days starting today. The section where Miss Marie, an American woman who joined the performance at the Summer Pavilion, sings Peking opera, is still included this time, and many new programs have been added. In addition, there are sound comedy films, etc., the program is very heavy, and the seat prices are divided into three types: six jiao, eight jiao, and one yuan, which is more than half cheaper than the seat prices at the Summer Pavilion Theater.</p>

<h3>Garbage Problems and Shanghai Municipality (Continued)</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Cleansing Division Manuscript</p>
<p>(III) The Nature of Shanghai's Garbage: The waste discarded by Shanghai residents can be roughly divided into four categories, each collected by specialized individuals: (1) Excrement is contracted out to cleaning merchants, who pay a monthly fee for the manure's resale value. (2) Food scraps and leftovers (i.e., leftover rice, dishes, soup, etc.) are collected by "slop-carriers" to feed pigs. (3) Cloth scraps, wastepaper, and other usable items are collected by "scavengers" and sold to secondhand dealers for resale. (4) Coal ash, etc., is collected by specialized coal ash collectors, sorted, and resold for road construction, etc. Apart from these four categories, all remaining items are swept up and collected by street cleaners and handled by administrative agencies. These include broken household appliances and all discarded household items, vegetable peels, bean pods, melon rinds, and all discarded plant matter, waste from vegetable markets, sweepings from roads, sweepings from inside houses, and the corpses of large and small animals, etc. Therefore, they contain various substances of animal, plant, and mineral origin, and are dry, wet, soft, and hard. Finding the most appropriate method of disposal is quite difficult. (IV) Observations on Current Garbage Disposal Methods in Shanghai: Shanghai's garbage disposal methods, apart from two incineration plants built in the Public Concession that can incinerate a small portion of the garbage, and the use of a small portion of it to fill in depressions in the Directly Administered Area, all the rest is loaded onto barges and transported to Longhua Mouth beach on the Huangpu River at the southern end of the city for dumping, amounting to several thousand tons daily. Because the equipment for loading, unloading, and transportation is inadequate, coupled with the difficult-to-eradicate habit of worker laziness, the transportation distance is long, the time required is excessive, the funding is insufficient, and although there are strict regulations for inspection and investigation, it is still difficult to be thorough. The act of dumping into the Huangpu River is repeatedly discovered by the water patrol, resulting in heavy fines and severe penalties, but people disregard the law. Reports continue to arrive intermittently. Upon detailed investigation, the most urgent areas for improvement are five: First, loading: The loading docks are still the old facilities from over a decade ago, with extremely rudimentary equipment. Leakage into the river during loading is unavoidable. Second, transportation: The transportation vessels are all ordinary cargo barges without any equipment for transporting garbage. Their forced use makes it difficult to ensure strictness. Third, unloading: Although the dumping ground has a dock, there is no unloading equipment. Regardless of high or low tide, human labor must be used to carry each load ashore, which is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, workers regard it as a dreaded task and are willing to risk violating the law and secretly dumping into the Huangpu River to be lazy and save effort. Fourth, dumping: The currently designated dumping ground is only on the Pudong bank, a shallow beach. When the tide recedes, the beach is very large, but when the tide rises, it is half-submerged in water. There are no buildings, and it is left to the tidal erosion. If it is piled near the water's edge, it will inevitably float away with the tide, endangering water sources and obstructing traffic. Fifth, rivers: Longhua Mouth is located in a bend of the river, where the water flow is slow, and pollution accumulates easily. Even without garbage dumping, new beaches will inevitably gradually rise. (V) Suggestions for Improving Garbage Disposal Methods in Shanghai's Directly Administered Area: If we want to improve disposal methods now, there are only two ways: fundamental solutions and stopgap measures. (A) The fundamental solution is to seek a thorough solution based on the nature of Shanghai's garbage, which is to use incineration (already piloted in the Public Concession) or composting (see the first issue of the third volume of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's published "Health Monthly"). However, using either method, even considering the 500 to 600 tons per day in the Directly Administered Area, the cost would be at least two to three million yuan to start, plus daily ongoing maintenance costs, which is not easy to afford given the current financial situation. (B) The stopgap measure is to improve the current dumping method to reduce the abuse of secretly dumping into the river, outlined as follows. The construction plan and cost still need to be estimated by the Public Works Bureau: (1) The loading dock should be covered with a roof to prevent ash from being blown away and should be a certain number of feet above the water surface so that ships can still dock and load under the dock at high tide. It should also be widened and lengthened so that three or four transport ships can be docked underneath. Three or four holes should be opened in the bottom of the dock to install telescopic funnels to directly load into the ship's hold and prevent leakage into the river. (2) The transport vessels can temporarily continue to use old-style barges. Several covered wooden boxes should be added to each ship to facilitate unloading and prevent dumping into the river. (3) The dumping ground dock should have hoisting equipment. When the ship arrives, the crane can be used to lift the wooden boxes, place them on handcarts on a light railway on the dock, and push them back and forth to the dumping ground, which requires less effort and achieves twice the result. (4) A stone embankment of considerable height should be built around the shore of the dumping ground. The garbage must not be piled higher than the embankment or outside the embankment, so that the rising and falling tides will not erode the garbage into the river. (5) The river should be dredged and straightened to avoid pollution accumulation and facilitate transportation and unloading, which is especially important. The stopgap measure requires less funding and is easier to maintain. If it can be adopted and implemented, and the two Concessions follow suit, then water sources and transportation will all benefit.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Two One Branch Talk</p>
<p>Small Preface</p>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>Turning out "Miscellaneous Records from the West Hall," I happened to see a kind of essay called "Five Nine Branch Talk," which aroused my curiosity.</p>
<p>Isn't "Miscellaneous Records from the West Hall" the work of Mr. You Xitang? Wasn't Mr. You an erudite scholar of the early Qing Dynasty? He wasn't Liu Bowen, so how could he have foreseen the national humiliation of May 9th hundreds of years later, and marked these two words "Five Nine" in the title?</p>
<p>Later, after carefully reading his preface, I realized that his "Five Nine" was another "Five Nine." He started writing during the period from the Winter Solstice to the end of the year. As the saying goes, "Counting the Nines from the Winter Solstice," the period from the Winter Solstice to the end of the year is exactly five nines, so it is called "Five Nine Branch Talk."</p>
<p>I also want to call this incoherent and rambling talk "Five Nine Branch Talk," to show that it is a work written after being stimulated by national humiliation; however, this term has been preempted by him, so I have to change the name to "Two One Branch Talk."</p>
<p>"Two One" and "Five Nine" generally commemorate national humiliation; the unreasonable demands of the Twenty-One Demands were the scars of the Twenty-One Demands on May 9th, and my "Two One Branch Talk" is "Five Nine Branch Talk."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the year I started writing was exactly the twenty-first year of the Republic of China; this year was the year of the Shanghai Battle, which is also worthy of commemoration as the title of the article.</p>
<p>Finally, I hung up a self-deprecating couplet:</p>
<p>Reading "Miscellaneous Records from the West Hall," imitating Dong Shi's frown.</p>
<h3>Old Man Cabinet</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>The new Japanese cabinet, led by Prime Minister Saito, consists of twelve people. The youngest, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto, is still forty-nine years old. The oldest, Minister of Finance Takahashi, is seventy-nine years old. The rest are all over fifty, sixty, or seventy years old. The total age is seven hundred and forty-eight years. It can be said that they are full of old age. This coup was initiated by young people, who did not hesitate to take risks and engage in activities with pistols and bombs. However, the result was the failure to establish a youth cabinet, but instead, a group of old men were bombed out, which is quite interesting.</p>
<p>In our country, Duke Mu of Qin trusted Meng Ming (the new faction) and rejected Jian Shu (the old faction), losing his army at Yao. He wrote the "Qin Oath" to repent, which Confucius deleted and preserved in the "Book of Documents," which is a classic. "Yellow-haired and virtuous" refers to the elders, and the influence of the classics on successive dynasties has been to favor the mature and experienced in employing people and administering government. According to the prescribed term of service, black-haired prime ministers were rarely seen. Gradually, in the late Qing Dynasty, the senile and foolish held court and brought about the demise of the country. When things reach an extreme, they change. In the past thirty years, youth has been revered and recognized as the masters of the country. During the Northern Expedition and the Revolution, it can be said that the youth were at their peak, which was also the era when the elders were out of luck. They were posthumously given the title of "outdated" and likened to being buried alive. Old, rotten, foolish, and mediocre were words that were always linked together, as if it were a law. In fact, it is difficult to make a hasty judgment on the gains and losses of the old and the young. Looking at foreign countries, the leaders in power are not young and handsome. Even judges are old and pretend to have white hair. In the war of 1914, the generals, such as Hindenburg, Sakharov, Joffre, Foch, and McKenna, were all weak at seventy or strong at fifty or sixty. Why are the old not easily overthrown?</p>
<p>Thinking of the path to fame and fortune, how many people have achieved it extraordinarily? Talent is mostly innate, and knowledge and ability have been tasted through hardships and know the truth and falsehood. By the time they become famous, they have reached middle age. Political evolution is a process of molting and a spiral. The new and the old, the old and the young, are by no means like cutting a bamboo shoot in half with one knife. The old have extensive experience, but they are also showing signs of old age. The young have a lot of vigor, but it is difficult to satisfy the expectations of the people. Thus, they rub and collide, oppose and complement each other. There is no unfallen old man, and there are few Gan Luo. Even the Saito and others of today are the young people of yesterday. When they were young, they were dissatisfied with the old people before them and wanted to replace them. Their struggle was spiraling and molting. By the time they ascended the stage, they were already yellow-haired. The young people of today are the Saito of the future. At this time, they are unconsciously drawing gourds in the molting spiral, imitating Saito's appearance.</p>
<h3>Talk on Fat People</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>Many people suffer from being overweight, but in Istanbul, Turkey, there is a fat people's club. Its president, Arif, and others, on the other hand, want to increase their weight. The club currently has 150 members. This summer, several members plan to travel around Europe. They feel that their obesity is not enough to impress people in London, Paris, and Berlin, so they are trying their best to eat more in the hope of gaining a few pounds before departure. President Arif told a Reuters reporter one day, "My weight is only 23 stone (each stone is equivalent to 14 pounds in the UK, and 23 stone is equivalent to 322 pounds), which I regret. I very much hope to increase it to 25 stone, so that I can enjoy the blessings of the fat man's paradise." As he spoke, he was beaming with excitement.</p>
<p>Showing his earnest aspiration, he also said, "I am very selective about my diet. I have already used a dozen bottles of cod liver oil and injected the same amount of egg yolk into my body in the hope of achieving my wish this summer and then embarking on a long journey. There is not a single woman in the fat people's club, because while the members try to gain weight, Turkish women crave a slim figure and a slender waist. Therefore, they usually enjoy dancing, tennis, and walking. The weak women used to rely on pillows to pass the time, but now they also stride in the streets to make their bodies thinner and more charming.</p>
<p>The aforementioned president of the fat people's club weighs only 23 stone. Compared with Harry, a fat man in Los Angeles, USA, he is like a small witch compared to a great one. Harry is twenty-three years old, six feet one inch tall, and weighs fifty-six stone and thirty-one pounds (equivalent to seven hundred and eighty-seven pounds). He is not only the king of fat people in the world today, but also unheard of and unseen in all the years that can be remembered. In the past, there was a fat man named Lambert in England who died in 1809, weighing only seven hundred and thirty-nine pounds. Also, Ms. Huier of the Ninglin Opera Troupe weighs only about six hundred and thirty pounds, but she is probably a giant among the fat women in the world.</p>
<p>Now there are people who eat from the same pot and eat the same amount, but one is fat and the other is thin. Why? The reason is that at the bottom of the brain stem, there is a soft gland. Blood circulates through it, but there is no tube to communicate with it, so it is a ductless gland specifically called a mucus-secreting gland, because the old saying is that the saliva in the mouth comes from this gland. A kind of essence is made in the delicate membrane of this gland, which is more important to the human body than any liquid on the tongue. The secretions of this gland that are absorbed into the blood control the growth of the body and regulate the quality of the transformed matter after food digestion. When its action is appropriate, it can allow an appropriate amount of fat to accumulate under the skin, making our muscles plump. If the action of this gland is excessive, the fat is burned into heat and energy in the body, and even if the person eats incessantly, he will still be skinny. If the action of this gland is sluggish, the fat will not be burned and will accumulate thickly under the skin. This is why Harry is so obese. Even if he reduces his food intake to the point of weakness, the small amount he consumes will also be converted into fat, which stays and does not disappear. Therefore, even if he exercises to the extreme or starves himself from time to time, his weight of seven hundred and eighty-seven pounds will only be reduced by a few pounds.</p>
<h3>A Record of Chinese and Foreign Strongmen Wrestling</h3>
<p>— Zhenghong</p>
<p>There is a Westerner named K, who claims to be able to lift 410 pounds with his hands and is a well-known athlete in Europe. K founded a sports school on a certain road in western Shanghai, only a hundred steps away from my humble abode. However, I have never entered it to see what it is like. Last Sunday, my friend Mr. Wang came to tell me that he was going to K's school with a young Chinese strongman to wrestle with European strongmen. Now they are outside the door. I listened and gladly followed him out. I introduced myself to Mr. So-and-so and looked at his appearance. He was just a handsome young man. I didn't know he possessed unique skills. When we arrived at our destination, we saw small portraits of European strongmen as soon as we entered the door. They were hung all over the wall. They were tall and strong. Compared with Mr. So-and-so's slender build, it seemed that he was no match for them. When we arrived at the gymnasium, there were dozens of scientific fitness equipment of various kinds. I couldn't name them all. At about three o'clock, the audience arrived in an endless stream. Then the interpreter described how beautiful and perfect the school's equipment was and how brave and resourceful the principal's techniques were. There were many boastful words, so I won't repeat them. When it came to the public performance, another strongman first performed on the parallel bars. Then he played with an iron hammer weighing dozens of pounds, throwing it up and down as lightly as a bullet. At this time, the interpreter told the audience, "East Asian athletes may as well give it a try." But everyone clicked their tongues and shook their heads. No one dared to respond. Then Mr. K presented his unique skills. First, he held on to the parallel bars with both hands, bent but not extended. His feet were supported by a horizontal plank, and his limbs were in the air. Then two people hung an iron weight of 120 pounds around his neck. Mr. K then stretched his neck and pulled the weight, gradually rising. His arms were as straight as arrows, and the applause was like thunder. Before that, the school had widely published advertisements in various newspapers, saying that anyone who could perform the same performance as Mr. K would be rewarded with 500 gold coins. The interpreter repeated these words to the audience, and the Chinese strongman stood up in response. He hung the weight around his neck and jumped up, performing exactly like Mr. K. The audience applauded and cheered, saying that it was enough to make the sick men of the East stand tall and proud. However, the reward of 500 gold coins was canceled on the pretext that the posture was not correct. The audience was indignant at what he did. However, Mr. So-and-so's purpose was not in the money, so he just laughed it off. When the meeting was adjourned, everyone got up from their seats. Mr. K looked at Mr. So-and-so with an iron weightlifting device (weighing about 200 pounds, which the Chinese call a "hermit's burden") that had been placed in the field in advance, intending to compete with him in strength. Mr. So-and-so nodded. Mr. K then stepped forward to hold the device, first supporting it with his abdomen, then with his shoulders, and finally lifting it over his head and extending it. He did this three times. Mr. So-and-so then raised his sleeves and pulled his arms, lifting it up in one go. He then raised it high, lowered it down, and did this more than ten times before stopping. The audience shouted, "Long live the Chinese athlete!" Looking back at the Western strongmen, they were all dumbfounded and scurried away. The crowd then dispersed in a hubbub. The interpreter rushed to hold Mr. So-and-so's hand and asked for his name. Mr. So-and-so smiled and said, "I am a sick man of a sick country. Why ask?"</p>
<h3>A Record of Mo Lu's Book Carving</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>In ancient times, people used peach pits to make records. Reading about them always made me yearn for them. At first, I didn't dare to believe that the skills of the engravers could be so exquisite. How could they capture landscapes, figures, and even portray their spirit and likeness in a small space? However, seeing my friend Lai Zi Mo Lu's creation of chisels, carving clouds and smoke, I believed that the ancients did not deceive me. I have known Mo Lu for less than a year. Looking at his appearance and behavior, he seems to be accustomed to being a pampered young man. He has never studied metal and stone. He often visits the residence of Old Man Zao Fen and sees him frequently. I know that he is good at reading Hui Shu's and Cang Shi's seal manuals and browsing the surviving inscriptions on bronze tripods and tiles. His occasional comments are often pertinent. I was surprised by him. This spring, Mo Lu suddenly presented me with a fan. It was less than a foot square, and on it was written "The Lament" in the style of Li Sao. The characters were as fine as needle pricks, gathered in mustard seeds, and viewed under a microscope, their shapes were not different. Therefore, I knew that truly intelligent people cannot be judged by their appearance. So I gave the fan to Hai Shang Xian Ou and asked him to paint a picture of "Snail Shell Dojo." Both are works of meticulous craftsmanship. It is precious to be able to combine both beauties. Mo Lu can also engrave on ivory bamboo bones, either writing or painting, each to its fullest extent. He gave me a piece of ivory, engraved with the full text of Banqiao Old Man's "Dao Qing," and every character is wonderful, with no fat or thin strokes. He has already reached the level of divine skill. However, whenever Mo Lu is drunk, he wields his brush and writes "Pi Ke" characters. His bones are in the style of Yan and Liu, and his body is in the style of seal script. They are also vigorous and eye-catching, and no one else can compare with him. Mr. Wang Xishen said, "If we talk about Lai Zi's talent, he is truly worthy of being Li Guang's unparalleled talent. Considering his comments, how can he be willing to be second to Wen Jiao? Zheng Qian's biography calls him a master of three arts, and Liu Hun's talent is equal to ten people. Comparing him to the ancients, how can he be inferior?" This is what I also say about Mo Lu.</p>
<h3>On Frugality and National Salvation (1)</h3>
<p>— Nie Zengjifen narrated, her son Qi Jie wrote</p>
<p>My mother is concerned about the extravagance of society, so she narrated her late husband's teachings to contribute to the present age, meaning to show frugality in the face of national extravagance. Qi Jie believes that this is a major issue related to the governance, chaos, security, and well-being of the world, so he asked his mother to elaborate on it. Therefore, she narrated the reasons for success and failure, gain and loss, from ancient times to the present, in China and abroad, and verified them with facts. Without realizing it, her words became lengthy, and she also praised ancient righteousness while belittling modern sayings, fearing to offend contemporary taboos or cause criticism. I hope readers will view it separately. If the wording is inappropriate or the references are incorrect, know that it is all Qi Jie's fault. Furthermore, Qi Jie has been ill for a long time and cannot endure thinking. He wrote this while struggling with his illness, so there are many omissions. Readers are fortunate to teach and correct them. Nie Qijie respectfully notes.</p>
<p>Looking back at the traces of governance, chaos, prosperity, and decline over thousands of years, and the waxing and waning of extravagance and frugality at any given time, extravagance in society is generally an expression of indulgence and unrestrained ambition. Frugal customs are an expression of self-restraint and the restoration of ritual. Indulging desires means that the seeds of killing are stirring and chaos is coming. Respecting ritual and righteousness means that the vitality of life is sprouting and governance is flourishing. The omens are very subtle, but the verification of the facts has never been off the mark. In my own experience, there is also something to tell. I was born in the early years of Xianfeng, when the Guangdong Rebellion had just begun. My late father, Wen Zheng, single-handedly came out to take on difficult tasks. At that time, it had been a long time since peace, and the court and the people were indulging in pleasure and accustomed to hypocrisy. Military affairs and official governance were extremely corrupt. There was no money to allocate, and no soldiers to fight. My late father initially served as a local gentry in the militia, and later became the governor-general of various provinces, commanding more than ten thousand soldiers. He led his subordinates with integrity and managed his family with frugality, vowing not to send a single penny from the army home. He was able to create a positive atmosphere, and for a time, generals and officials encouraged each other with morality and integrity, so they were able to cooperate sincerely and quell the great disaster. One or two people in high positions restrained themselves and their desires, and the results were like this. When my late father was in the army, my late mother lived in the countryside. She had no change to spend. Her difficult situation was not understood by others, who thought that the family of a governor-general should not be so poor. At that time, there was a saying in the countryside that the oil from killing a pig in the Xiushan Hall could only provide three days of food, and the oil from killing a chicken in the Huangjin Hall also had to be used for three days. The Xiushan Hall was where my late uncle Cheng Hou lived. Because he handled local militia affairs, there were many guests, and there were often several tables of food. The Huangjin Hall was the house where my late mother lived. From these few words, one can imagine the frugality of my late mother at that time.</p>
<h3>Record of Military Horses in Double Buildings (68)</h3>
<p>— Owner of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Boundless Sadness and Resentment in Repentance, Difficult to Expect Broad-mindedness; Extreme Singing and Dancing, Can See Majesty</p>
<p>When Mao Deshun first arrived, he was very attentive. He took out many precious objects from a handbag, such as silver teapots, silver-supported glass cups, gold cigarette cases, and gold-framed small mirrors. He moved them all to the front shop, placing them on the shelves with the four-color dried and wet high-装dishes. It was as if he had opened a small exposition. Then he called the tea boy to make tea and personally lit 洋火 and handed out cigarettes. After the ladies were comfortable drinking tea and smoking, he jumped to the upper floor in the back and sat beside An Yutian. Leaning in his ear, he pointed his finger and said, "It's only a little after eight o'clock now. Our commander-in-chief really came early. Look, the one sitting in the middle booth is him. There are not many people accompanying him yet. The戏 stage is not set up yet. Why don't I take you there now?" An Yutian followed Xiao Mao's finger and looked from a distance. He really recognized a small mustache wearing a melon-skin satin hat with a five-color treasure star and a large winter pearl in the middle, squished into a ball and making funny faces, which was exactly the same as the image of Ye Zuozhang that he usually saw in the newspaper. He was thinking about how to be more generous and go on stage to deal with this dramatic performance. Unexpectedly, Xiao Mao had already made arrangements with the Fifth Madam, and unexpectedly pulled him away. There was no time to calmly plan. He secretly squeezed a handful of sweat and grasped a shaking heart. He followed Xiao Mao and stumbled to the side of Ye Zuozhang's booth. Xiao Mao went in first to inform him. Ye Zuozhang nodded and said "Please." He even stood up his monkey-like small body and showed a smile full of wrinkles to An Yutian. An Yutian hurriedly stepped into the booth and bowed three times tremblingly. Ye Zuozhang waved his hand again, asking him to sit in front so that they could talk. An Yutian kept in mind the instructions of the women in the boudoir and tried to avoid timidity. He took a big step and was about to cross into the chair in the front. Unexpectedly, his mind was still in a daze. He actually forgot that there were two steps in the booth. Stepping down from the high place was not the same as flat ground. It was as if he had stepped into a deep pit. It seemed that he was about to fall into the pile of chairs. Could he avoid embarrassment and impropriety on the spot? Let's see what is written in the next chapter.</p>

<h3>Thief Out of the Closed Gate</h3>
<p>— Jian Hua</p>
<p>"The thief exits the closed gate" is a common saying, which means that people cannot prevent something beforehand, cannot eliminate it temporarily, and can only panic and remedy it afterward, so it has little effect. However, since ancient times, there have been countless precedents of "the thief exiting the closed gate." Do you think they are all fools? Although they cannot prevent the first visit of the thief, after being injured, they add a kind of closed-door defense work, which can at least reduce the possibility of the second and third visits of the thief. The so-called "mending the fold after losing sheep" and the so-called "correcting deviations and remedying evils" are nothing more than the meaning of the thief exiting the closed gate. Now people, especially the people of our country, are probably already at the extreme of evolution. If the thief doesn't come, it is naturally "all four gates open." If the thief comes, they "invite the thief into the house." If the thief leaves, "the door is set up but not closed."</p>
<p>For example, the great flood in Hankou last year. If we had prepared a little beforehand, it wouldn't have turned into such an unprecedented tragedy. When the water came, we could only be in a hurry and let it surge and impact, helpless. After the water receded, we always thought that we should do some "closed-door" defense work, but the clever Chinese people thought that this was a disturbance for mediocre people, and the great flood would not come again. Who knew that the impolite great flood would probably come again now. There are many such examples, and I don't need to list them. Alas!</p>

<h3>Homemade Rubber Goods</h3>
<p>— Nai Zheng</p>
<p>Since Nelson Goodyear invented vulcanization in 1839, the usefulness of rubber has further advanced. The more rubber a country uses today, the more developed its industry is proven to be, as rubber holds an extremely important position in industry. Currently, rubber is in great demand in our country, so I am writing to introduce it.</p>
<p>(1) The Source of Rubber</p>
<p>Simply put, rubber is the sap that flows from the trunk of a certain plant, so it is also called tree sap. The areas where rubber plants grow are limited to between 30 degrees south latitude and 30 degrees north latitude, because rubber trees require a warm climate to grow.</p>
<p>(2) Classification of Rubber</p>
<p>Raw Rubber: The sap of rubber trees planted in the South Sea Islands and India, etc. The natives cut a V-shape in the tree trunk, and a bucket is placed underneath to collect the sap. Later, it solidifies and becomes a lumpy or blocky substance.</p>
<p>Hard Raw Rubber: The sap of rubber trees produced in places like Singapore. After flowing from the tree, it solidifies into a hard substance, but it can be softened by immersing it in hot water and can be molded into various shapes at will.</p>
<p>Vulcanized Rubber: An item made from raw rubber, which is then vulcanized to contain sulfur. It can stretch and is elastic, unlike raw rubber which hardens and shrinks when cold, and softens and becomes sticky when hot. Therefore, it has the most uses, such as motorcycle tires, medical instruments, drive belts on machines, electrical wire sheathing, rubber raincoats and shoes, etc., which are all this type of rubber.</p>
<p>Hard Rubber: A type of rubber containing a large amount of sulfur, heated at a higher temperature for a long time. It loses its elasticity, becomes horny, and is a good insulator for electricity. Its main use is in making electrical appliances, and it is very glossy and beautiful, and is not corroded by various chemicals, so it is very good for making decorations and various utensils.</p>
<p>(3) Manufacturing of Rubber</p>
<p>Rubber Paste: Manufacturing rubber paste is also a branch of the rubber industry, and there are many factories that specialize in manufacturing this product. The method is to first mix the rubber with various substances, then put it into a container and stir it to make a paste, which is then packaged in cans for sale. Recipe for rubber tube repair paste: Para rubber, 2.5 pounds; Benzine, 0.5 gallons; Pine oil, 0.5 pints; Collodion, 0.5 pints (small trials can reduce proportionally). Uses: Can repair tire inner tubes, water bags, etc., and can also be used to coat and repair rubber waterproof cloth.</p>
<p>Rubber Tube: Method: Place 0.5 pints of chloroform in a wide-mouthed glass bottle, add 4 ounces of chopped raw rubber, and seal with a stopper. After ten minutes, the rubber will dissolve, turning into a light brown glue liquid. Then, pour it into a long glass tube with a sealed end and a slightly larger diameter. Insert a round glass rod, then pull it out. A thin layer of glue will adhere to the outside of the glass rod. Now, it must be hung in a ventilated place to dry, allowing the chloroform to evaporate. Then, repeat the previous method of inserting the rod into the material, and another layer will adhere. Dry it again. Repeat this process several times until the desired thickness is reached. Finally, pull out the glass rod, and the rubber tube is complete. Then, take another long glass tube, also sealed at one end, and pour in 50 parts of carbon disulfide and 1 part of sulfur chloride (the above two substances should not be inhaled into the lungs). Mix them well. Insert the completed rubber tube. After three or four seconds, take it out. The tube will have absorbed the sulfur and become a vulcanized rubber tube, which will not change when exposed to cold or heat. However, if the tube is thin, it should not be inserted into the vulcanizing agent for more than three or four seconds, otherwise the tube will dissolve and disappear. If the tube is thicker, it can be immersed for a few seconds longer. Its uses are extensive. Medical instruments and chemical instruments all need to be equipped with rubber tubes.</p>

<h3>Current Affairs</h3>
<p>— Gu Liang</p>
<p>A Shop Assistant's Account</p>
<p>"As you know, I work as a shop assistant at XX Cotton Fabrics Company. Sixty percent of our store's business is XX goods, thirty percent is Western goods, and domestic goods only account for ten percent! Ever since the Northeast Incident last year, business has plummeted. At that time, the anti-Japanese fervor was at its boiling point, and the so-called 'inspection of goods' was very enthusiastic. After that, we didn't dare to import anymore. At the same time, although domestic goods seemed to be selling well, because our company has never had much connection with domestic manufacturers, we couldn't secure orders, so we could only spend our time frowning and accomplishing nothing. Later, the Shanghai War broke out, followed by a market strike, and business completely stopped. At that time, we shop assistants deeply resented the manager for not paying attention to promoting domestic goods, so that once something happened, we were at a loss. But we are ultimately shop assistants who 'follow orders,' and we usually don't dare to express any opinions to the 'king-like' manager, because we simply don't have the qualifications! After the ceasefire agreement was signed, people's hearts had relaxed, and XX goods had continued to be imported in large quantities, so the manager felt that 'heroes had a place to use their talents' again. Of course, after contacting them, he brought in dozens of boxes. Needless to say, according to Chinese customs, the manager is the 'provider' for us shop assistants, and everything depends on him 'raising his hand,' especially in this time of 'national crisis layoffs,' when there is a danger of losing our jobs at any moment. Who dares not be cautious and work hard for the company? But we are all Chinese, and although I am just a shop assistant, I dare not forget the saying that 'every man has a responsibility.' In this situation, what do you think I should do?"</p>
<p>This matter is not fabricated, but is a present reality. Moreover, I know one of the shareholders of this fabrics company. He is an admirable patriot who works hard in practical ways and has a reputation at the time. The store's business is controlled by the manager. As long as they make money, the shareholders probably don't want to interfere. But in this kind of place, we feel that it is very difficult to do something thoroughly and consistently. To reverse the decline of the country, it is truly not an easy task.</p>

<h3>An Odd Emotion</h3>
<p>— Yan Yu</p>
<p>It was a morning a few days ago. The late spring rain soaked every road in Shanghai city. Various vehicles drove in the rain, looking as disheveled as a flock of drowned chickens. After finishing two classes at a school on Yuanmingyuan Road, I hurriedly ran to Beijing Road on the Bund, jumped onto a Route 8 tram heading to Yangshupu. The passengers in the third-class carriage were packed in like sardines, and even in the first-class carriage, there was only one empty seat left. At the time, I unceremoniously took it.</p>
<p>It was probably at the Pengpu Road stop that the tram stopped. None of the passengers in the carriage made any move to get off. Undoubtedly, they were like me, not yet at their destinations. However, a young foreign girl jumped onto the tram at this time. After she dragged her wooden clogs into the carriage, her eyes immediately scanned around. It was immediately apparent that there were no empty seats left. Holding a sopping wet oiled paper umbrella in one hand and a purse in the other, she stood awkwardly by the door she had entered. She opened her purse and counted coins for the ticket seller. The tram traveled in the rain, swaying particularly violently. When the tram drove down the Waibaidu Bridge, the front of the car pitched forward, and she almost fell over, because she was taking coins out of her purse and hadn't grabbed the overhead rattan hoop.</p>
<p>All the passengers in the carriage focused their attention on her. Clearly, she was even more embarrassed. A blush, unique to young girls, spread from light to deep, covering her face. Her eyes, however, were meaninglessly staring at the raindrops on the glass window outside the carriage.</p>
<p>Logically, we young people who have received the baptism of a university education should never sit idly by and watch a woman in distress without offering assistance. At this time, I should have immediately stood up and offered her my seat. These are all the manners of a so-called civilized person. But the girl standing in front of me, in the recent past, almost made me angry whenever I saw her, regardless of whether they were male, female, old, or young, they all made me hate them. I was unwilling to show any more courtesy to this cruel race.</p>
<p>The tram had arrived at Tilanqiao. Several passengers jumped off. A Western woman sitting next to that girl from a neighboring country waved her hand and asked her to sit down. At the same time, the sound of rattling motorcycle engines on the road attracted the attention of the passengers. A dozen or so enemy soldiers were speeding towards Yangshupu in single file. Instantly, a natural smile appeared on the girl's face. One stop further, I jumped off the tram and went home, my heart filled with an odd emotion.</p>
<p>Learning to Laugh</p>
<h3>All Quiet on the Western Front</h3>
<p>— Lao Tang</p>
<p>Usually (except when the teacher is standing nearby), the evening self-study room is our (including both male and female students) "talking room" and "debate hall."</p>
<p>Tonight, the "issue of male and female hegemony" was the focus of our debate, because the most self-proclaimed "Loudmouth Fang," after watching "The Private Life of Helen of Troy," boasted so much that he lit the fuse for a big debate.</p>
<p>Here, there are two opposing lines. Of course, one side is the "heroes" who dare to brag, and the other side is the "heroines" who are unwilling to show weakness.</p>
<p>"We men hold the hegemony of the world. The queen in 'The Private Life of Helen of Troy' is a good example of women submitting to men." "Loudmouth Fang" loudly announced that he had seen "The Private Life of Helen of Troy" today.</p>
<p>"How do you see that? 'The Private Life of Helen of Troy' is just a film, not a fact!" Ms. Li, who often shows off on the sports field, shouted the first call for resistance.</p>
<p>Jiang Luobo, a bookworm poisoned by the old feudal ethics (alternate name: Pickled Radish), joined the allied side and formed a front with Loudmouth Fang. "Nay, nay, have you read the immortal saying 'The husband is the heaven'? The 'husband' refers to men." He shook his silly head and swayed his silly brain, so that the self-study room was filled with a sour smell. "A brain from 5000 BC!" Ms. Zhang struck the pose she had shown at a recent debate: "We are modern people, not ancient people. Modern people should speak modern language and use modern facts as a premise."</p>
<p>Ma Jiajun from Shandong, known as Ma Yongzhen the Second, struck the pose of "punching Jiangnan and Zhejiang provinces" and raised a big thumb, saying in a voice like a bell: "Are there any female inventors in the modern age? Are there any female political leaders in the modern age?" Ms. Zhao in the corner hugged the principle of "soldiers come, generals will block; water comes, earth will dam," and said loudly, "The Soviet Union has female ambassadors, and isn't there also three female comrades in our country's National Assembly? You..." Before she could finish her sentence, the dormitory supervisor appeared at the door, and the entire self-study room fell silent. The boys liked it so much that their faces lit up with joy, and the girls were so angry that they lowered their heads in silence.</p>
<p>The dormitory supervisor walked past the door, and suddenly a wave of sound floated in from outside the door: "All quiet on the Western Front!" Then a head with a shaved monk's head poked in. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the famous prankster "Turtle Egg."</p>
<h3>Business Practices</h3>
<p>— Ming Zhi</p>
<p>Under the banner of huge discounts: slogans such as "Buy one foot, give one foot" are no longer fashionable. So, new terms such as "full foot plus ten" and "market foot plus ten" have emerged to replace them. On the other hand, the old tune of "full foot plus two" and "market foot plus three" has been changed to new terms such as "buy one zhang, get three chi free," or "buy two zhang, get four chi free." One can't help but admire people's skill in inventing new tricks!</p>
<p>Cheap dishes, economical dishes, five jiao a meal, six jiao a serving, are sold in restaurants, sold in dim sum shops, and even sold in large restaurants. Now, they are also sold in hotels. In the near future, maybe they will also be sold in teahouses. People's research on eating is becoming more and more sophisticated; their business methods are also evolving accordingly.</p>
