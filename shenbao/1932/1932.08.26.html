<h3 id="c1">日人將正式承認爲國仁 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>近據路透東京通訊。謂日人將於九月十八日瀋變週年紀念之日。正式予满洲僞國以承認。并將與僑國訂立基本條約。其約稿并將送交國聯秘書處登記。該約之内容。約爲（一）滿洲僞國國防交日本全權處理。（二）滿洲各鐵路之經營。概歸南滿鐵道辦理。（三）滿洲僞國應承繼前由中國簽訂之各項條約。（四）所有日本在滿洲之權利。應儘量訂入條約之内。（五）凡現爲滿洲僞國官吏之日人。皆予以妥實之保障。（六）日人在滿洲應有旅行居住及經商之自由等數條。此次武藤使滿時。并聞内田己將該約要點指示武藤矣。</p>
<p>九一八事變以後。我國即以解决之責任。委之於國際聯盟而。根據九國條約。非戰條約。以求和平之處理。然而周年以還。彼侵略者不唯無若干翻然悔悟之意。且更變本加厲。一面積極以槍砲侵略。一面又手製滿洲僞國。以飾人耳目。同時更揚言日本無領土之野心與九國條約之尊重。</p>
<p>九國條約中嘗有［中國之主權獨立領土完全。］［不得在中國創設勢力範圍］。及［中國鐵路不得有不公平待遇］等之規定。在非戰公約中有［不得以戰争爲貫澈國策之手段］之規定。再在國聯盟約之中。有［服從公斷及裁决者。不得對之訴諸戰争］之規定。揆之於日本過去之事實。及此次對僞國將訂立之基本條約。無一非背於條約之精神。及曩日日本［無領土野心］之約言。乃今日内田於議會中作外交方針演説時。聲言日本之出兵東北爲不違反非戰公約。而反狡言爲忍無可忍下之爆發。同時更揚言滿洲僞國之承認與九國條約不相衝突。而反以爲九國條約不能禁止中國一地方住民之發意而成立一獨立國。故今日日本之承認滿洲僞國。不與九國條約相牴觸云云。誠所謂事實爲事實。雄辯爲雄辯。誰能信其爲言行之相符。吾人猶憶在國聯特别大會决議案中。有［蹂躪聯合會會員領土之完整及變更其政治之獨立之舉動。聯合會各會員。均不能認爲有効］之句。且决議案中並聲明違反聯合會盟約及巴黎公約之方法。所取得之地位條約或恊定。聯合會會員均不能承認之。是以日人之狡言拙計。早己爲世界人士所共鑑矣。</p>
<p>今再進而言日本承認僞國徒之國際形勢。請先述日俄間之態度。夫最近俄國面遠東方面。其所認爲生命線者。厥唯西伯利亞與外蒙。若北滿之利權尚不過其小焉者也。故如日本能安然以奪取滿洲爲己足。則俄國方面。當不致與日本爲難。或更將步日本之後塵。而承認滿洲僞國。亦未可知。最近在華盛頓盛傅日俄間己成立一新諒解。其内容爲（一）中東鐵路之俄方權利。日方承認保護。（二）日本對西伯利亞邊界及蒙古之日軍行動。加以限制。（三）俄方在滿蒙之商業利益。由日方保護。如此項消息屬實。則日俄間殆有暫時携手同立於一條戰線上之可能矣。再言日美間之態度自九一八事變發生以後。日美即始終站於敵對之地位上。本月八日史汀生在紐約外交討論會上之一席演説。己盡量表現其態度而無遺。在演詞中聲言絶對不承認以武力所造成之局面。意在鼓勵國聯對日採有力之行動。而日人對此始終未作正式之口頭表示。惟今次日本滿洲僞國之斷然承認。實含有以事實向美國抗議之意。故異日僞國被承認後日美間之外交。必更形惡化。殆屬無疑。近日本外交主張聯俄拒美。蓋即深明此種形勢者也。此外在歐洲方面之國家。其對於中日兩國之態度。或偏向於日本。或嚴守其模稜之地位。即有一二小國出於同情而援助我國。要亦杯水車薪。無濟於事。</p>
<p>故滿洲僞國之成立。雖各國僉以爲一齣傀儡把戲。然而誰願爲［中論］哉即日美間將來態度之惡化。亦不過出之於一二書面抗議而己。爲今之計。我國祇能乘僞國未被承認或將被承認之際。拚全力以收復失地。萬不能再以苟安之態度。而求助於人矣。此九一八慘痛之紀念日將臨。吾人應速覺悟過去之錯誤而有所警惕也。</p>

<p>扶助東省獨立竟指爲分離運動結果</p>
<p>恣意攻訐我革命政府冀淆世界視聽</p>
<p>華聯社二十五日東京電　日外長内田康哉今日在國會演説外交方針、先説明九一八事變以后之外交經過、並宣佈日本不久將承認僞組織、謂［滿洲國］是出於中國政界分解作用之结果、否認日本手創僞國、强辯不違反九國公約、與非戰公約於其結論、内田宣佈日本新外交政策、在確立遠東門羅主義以日本·［滿洲國］·及中國三國之合作、维持遠東之和平、極力掩蔽日本破壞遠東和平之事實、最堪注意者、爲關於九一八事變之原因、内田所説與幣原前外長前后發生矛盾、</p>
<p>路透社二十五日東京電　外相内田今晨在議會之言論、略曰、吾人所欣慰者、［滿洲國］現己入稳健進取之進程中、日政府深信日本之承認此新國、乃固定遠東永遠和平之唯一方法、吾人爲及早承認［滿洲國］起見、故作種種籌備、一俟籌備完畢、即將實行、但他國有不充分明瞭日本對華態度、及去年九一八事件後日本所採行之計畫、且不知［滿洲國［成立之眞相、而視日本之承認［滿洲國］爲非法行動者、余觀於此種誤會、現乃乘此機會以説明日本地位、並向諸君説明政府所以視承認［滿洲國］爲解决東三省難題唯一方法之理由、事有不可否認者、中國境</p>
<p>内之紊亂狀况、與中國所行之革命政策、實爲近年遠東國際關係中發生不幸變化之原因、雖日本在中國非常事態中、犧牲最大、但他國亦遭受莫可忍受的侮辱、及不可計算的物質損失、同時凡熟悉中國現狀者、皆承認無論援用國聯會章、或其他所謂和平機關、胥未能獲一救濟辦法以療治之、以事實言、列强固常直接採用武力、而不恃此種和平工具以糾正或防止其在華重要權利之受傷害、此種習慣、由來己久、二十年來日本繼續爲極端之忍耐、希望中國能對國内加以整頓、對於遠東和平之維持、能盡其相當責任、惟中國對於吾人之善意及希冀、不但未能有誠意之報答、且其傲慢之態度、反更變本加厲、令人不堪忍受、日政府曾屢次警告中國政府、謂若促使日本國民至不能再行忍耐之境、則結果將極爲危險、但中國竟不理是種警告、於是遂有九一八東北事件之發生、其發生之地點、乃在日本之第一生命線、而發生之時間、則適爲日本國民受屢次挑釁奮激至不能復耐之時也、至此吾人除採自衛之行動外、無他法、現有一部分人士謂日本所採之行動、爲違反凱洛格非戰公约、但此説在事實上毫無根據、余曾言及日本係被迫而採取必要之行動、以保護關係日本國家生存之重要權利、且非戰公約對於行使自衛權若日本在東北之行動、並未有何種限制、該約亦未限制締約國採取各該國認爲必要之行動、以避免危及其土地及利益之危機、國家之行使自衛權、能擴充</p>

<p>相傅的許多忌憚、是一種傅統的社會迷信。</p>
<p>西洋人諱十三、我們中國人不須諱十三：但是醉心歐化的人、對於十三也得忌諱一下子，算是刮刮呌的摩登習慣。燕人諱四十五、載在吴翌鳳的遜志堂雜鈔：</p>
<p>丨燕人諱言四十五，人或問之，不曰，去年四十四歲：即曰，明年四十六歲。</p>
<p>魯人諱四十一、載在王小隐的負暄絮語：</p>
<p>丨市井間往往有一種鄙諺，人争避之：譬年至四十一，則諱言之：有問者，則詭詞以答，或竟直言忌諱年，毫無理解，至足發笑。丨此段叙魯省風俗。</p>
<p>吴人諱奴爲鼻，載在褚不農的堅瓠集；</p>
<p>丨吴俗，諱奴爲鼻：解者曰：粧門面耳。或曰：象鼻能觸人，猪鼻善掘地，義取生事云。</p>
<p>浙人諱鴨，載在莊綽的鷄肋編：</p>
<p>丨浙人以鴨爲名，大諱：鴨僅一雄，雖合而無卵；須得二三雄；始有子。以爲諱者，蓋爲是耳。</p>
<p>以上，所引種種忌諱，吴俗諱奴爲鼻，現在己少有此風：偶或説起僕人，尚有以鼻頭兩字代之。浙人諱鴨，今亦不然：但是，鷄肋編的著者，生在宋朝：他所説的，當然是宋人習慣。我便聯帶想到水滸傅中，鄆哥把武大郎當做肥鴨：武大道，我的老婆又不偷漢子，我如何是鴨？照這麽説宋人諱鴨，宛比今人諱龜：而所諱的地方，不限在浙省：武大是山東清河縣人，也懂得諱鴨，可見宋人諱鴨的風氣，是很普遍的了。</p>

<p>— 王蘧常</p>
<p>倭寇深入己十一月於兹矣。謀國者徒怵於其往日之梟悍。終不敢言戰。不日十日足以盡吾國。即曰曾不能一日守。一唱百和。牢不可破。即有一二忠勇之土。激於義憤而奮起。雖若深與之。面實深懼之也。故終首鼠於和戰。今倭己侵熱河。闚平津矣。謀國者雖有合力禦侮之言。我懼其或仍怵其梟悍而因循坐誤也。爰徵往事而正告之曰。事實終勝於虚語。倭又奚足畏也。甲午之役。大同江之戰。馬忠武以千數百之罷卒。當倭二萬餘之頑衆。且又困於重圍之中。其執懸絶。而馬軍終貫圍而出。斬獲過當。而葉志超仁川之戰。亦以羸卒二千突圍歸平壤。倭固善戰乎。吾固不能戰乎。此其一。平壤之戰。吾軍以萬五千人禦疆寇。而可戰者實只八千。且將怯卒。惰地廣力分。指揮復不統一。賊以五倍之衆攻之。宜若不能須臾守矣。然猶激戰四日。僅乃克之。倭固能守乎。此其二。俄之敗也。非倭之能勝也。俄實自敗之。未戰固己百孔千瘡。且勞師敝遠。識者早决其無勝理。然倭猶屢陷於苦戰。傷己至二十萬人。乃大木酋至愧而自裁。參謀長兒玉源太郎且日禱於東方。祈福利。亦可以知其力癉而知索矣。比其三。然此猶前日事也。或以爲不可語於今日。民國十七年濟南之役。吾軍城守者只五百人。賊倍攻而終不得逞。其後我軍以奉命撤防。突圍出。賊幾潰敗。時其國大阪朝日新聞記者。曾電述彼軍之狼狽。參謀長黑田周六見之。大慙憤。責其不愛國。不能掩飾其軍事。（此據龔君德柏言）。亦足見其軍之無用矣。此其四。至淞滬之戰。倭傾國之半。以當一隅。竟四易其司令。此尤彰彰在入耳目。有不必論者矣。倭爲徵兵制。兵率中産。且又習於逸樂。别家室。則牽衣而涕泣。祝平安。則乞靈於神祇。己非復昔日祈戰死之悍風。故一陷苦戰。即相率逃亡。淞滬及東北之戰。皆可察而知者也。此其五。且倭自勝俄以後。未遇大敵。中將以下。從侈紙上之兵。未嘗習於戰陣。且又中於暮氣。流於淫佚。每遇出兵。率挾藝妓以行。師出以律。倭固有律乎。此其六。徵諸昔。則如彼。考諸近。則如此。夫不能戰。不能攻。而又不能出之以律。徒恃其利器驕氣以圖一逞。又奚足畏乎。玄駒之有長也。魁其壞穴。而赤蚍飛䗟之闚其門者。必部其族以噬殺之。終遠於蛭。無相於離。則役衆蠢者必有以護之也。今闚門者迫矣。不能爲玄驹之噬敵。而欲衆之護於壞穴。其可得乎。嗚呼。可以人而不如玄駒乎。况又不足畏者乎。</p>

<p>海上人士，年來豪華的進步，可謂一日千里。但因伏莾潛滋危機四佈的緣故，不免存有戒心，尚不敢做一些過分的舉動：不然，像銀質汽車這類的享用，那好出風頭的闊老大少，早就拿它做一種排塲，恐决不會讓别個地方或别人家專美於前罷？</p>
<p>我有一位朋友經商檳榔嶼，月前久别重逢，他曾告訴我一件奇聞：</p>
<p>我國在檳榔嶼僑商的人們，不少從經營而致富的。内中有一個福建泉州人陳姓，己經積蓄有千餘萬的資産，他生性就好揮霍，一切的享用，都是窮奢極慾。年前忽異想天開，向英國某著名的汽車廠裏，定製一輛銀壳汽車，代價是三十萬金、不久汽車運到了，頓時轟動遠近的社會。</p>
<p>當他第一天乘坐的時候，就發生一個小小的波折，他坐着這銀汽車，由寓所到公司去辦事，行到半途，有個警察攔車對他説：［警長請陳先生，有要緊的事面談。］陳和警長本有交情，既是警長相請，不能不去，遂命司車的將車開往警廳。</p>
<p>入門，門警將他引到候訊室裏，他這纔駭念本人向不犯法，這究竟是什麽道理？未幾傅訊，警長一面見，就説：［奉着總督的命令，説陳某自奉太奢，居然乘坐銀質汽車，比較英皇還要逾分，應當科以相當罪名。］陳某抗辯着説：［汽車不准銀制，乘坐銀質汽車的應當禁止加罪，載在法律第幾條第幾項，請警長明示。某一安分商人，素未犯法，官廳例無拘禁的理由。警長雖稱係總督命令，但奢侈治罪，既無專條，則總督無故玷辱良民的名譽，損害良民的自由，應依何種裁判？某乃營業中人，時間非常寳貴，不能久留此間，而銀質汽車，某更非坐不可。］。云云。陳英語孄熟，所言又極有理，是日旁聽者近千人，均爲首肯。警長躊躇有頃。始允轉逹總督請示，嗣更宣告云：［陳某以銀質汽車爲乘坐之用，似非安分守己的所應有，始念尚無不法行爲，免予科罪。］陳某總算是勝訴，從此仍安安逸逸的享坐他那銀質汽車。</p>
<h3 id="c186">醉心偵探小説的學子 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 勞人</p>
<p>武俠小説。轉移青年意志最强。報章上常有許多少年離家。到天涯海角。去訪尋劍仙俠士的新聞。足夠給我們相當證明。可是事實愈演愈奇。浙江嘉興縣某高級中學。最近發現了一個因愛讀偵探小説而沉迷的學生。不惜犯罪。異想天開。在校舍裏面縱火至十數次之多。直到數月後方破案。他對校長説。我雖不幸失敗。但是很足自豪。一面又可證明學校當局偵探手段幼稚。對於經騐宏富的我。當然不易制服。這種怪事。眞可以説是破天荒了。某校是浙省最負盛名的一個中學。完全係基督教集資創辦。本年度春季始業時候。校舍裏連續開了好幾次火災。簇新的圖書館。因祝融神光顧。大受損失。學校當局百般防範。還是不能倖免。只得勉勵全體同學。隨時留意密察。久之。這件公案。非但不能水落石出。反變本加厲。校中極静僻的所在。也迭告火警。這一來。頓使全校同學驚惶不知所措。焦頭爛額。組織巡查隊。日夜梭巡。一面又恐係狐仙作祟。只得設案按日用鮮果供饌。希望不再開玩笑。誰知有一天晚上。有幾個學生。到操塲去散步。驀地裏瞧見一個童子。正在縱火。他們以爲良機不可坐失。急向前將放火人扭住。細辨之。原來是初中的同學。他説放火完全係高中某同學主使。至他放火唯一目的。完全是受偵探小説陶醉。特作實地試騐究竟一般人有無破案的能力。學校當局據供後。立將這位偵察小説迷除名。從此這離奇之火。就消滅無形了</p>
<h3 id="c187">二十一條秘史（四） <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 思頻</p>
<p>慕爾和唐納東遊歸來。得悉此事。十分警惶。統來看我。慕爾對於他的助手在他不在時候。不向日置益證實就發這樣的電報到美國。大爲憤懣。唐納也拿了一份二十一條要求來對我説。他爲了這事。己受館方嚴厲詰責。他們兩人因此各向倫敦紐約辭職。</p>
<p>慕爾曾把此二十一條要求見日置益。日置益力加否認。但是慕爾己經查出新聞的來源。深信這要求是確實的。我因之也去訪日置益。明知他對我也要否認此事的。我先派我的秘書路易士懷了二十條要求去見芮恩士。問他他所得到的關於二十一條的消息是否直接來自袁世凱。芮恩士對路易士的答語裏吐露一句。暗示他曾同袁世凱談過一次話。他並且告訴路易士。他己把日文的二十一條要求拍了照片。譯成了英文。他拿路易士帶去的二十一條到别一室同他的譯文校對後。對路易士説。［斐主教拿這二十一條去見日置益。不必怕他責備裴主教有意誣衊日本的。</p>
<p>我就往見日置益。寒暄之後。我便直率的同他討論二十一條要求。我説日本占領中國沿海口岸和北京易如反掌。但是日本自一八九六年得了台灣。還没有把它完全征服。雖則台灣不過是一彈丸之地。有一條鐵路。日本倘須靠兵力方能保有該島。日本費了二十年的經營。尚且不能征服三百萬人口的一島。日本要好久才能征服四萬萬人民的全中國呢。</p>
<p>我更指出幾個事實同他説。十七世紀時四川人反抗清朝。直至死亡了四分之一始告敉平。現在四川人口六千八百萬。離海岸一千五百英里。離最近的鐵路一千英里。我新近到過四川。該省仇日空氣濃厚。假使四川一省决心作殊死戰。日本就用兵半世紀也不能征服它。再如太平天國之亂。打了十幾年仗。死亡二千萬人。始平定下來。我對日置益剴切的説。中國廣士衆民。人懷必死之心。以遊擊戰同日本人周旋。日本永不會有併吞中國的希望的。就是列强也决不許日本控制中國以危害世界和平。即使日本吞下了中國。我相信列强一定要像一八九六年脅迫日本退出遼東半島的故事呌日本退出中國的。我希望日本不要自取其辱。况且現在日本國債累累。取法英國。竭力發展其工商業。是爲上策。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨日本埠報載，三井洋行買辦之子顧承佑，警告乃父珍先,辭退買辦職務，致觸乃父之怒，竟被驅逐，以致神筋錯亂，購物被拘，報上所載，大概如此，從舊目光看來，天然是倫常大變，從新目光看來，是愛國熱心的表現，到底是大變呢？還是熱心呢？應該澈底來講個明白，因爲現在是非不明，理智缺乏的時代，一件事體，總應該明白其究竟。</p>
<p>顧承佑警告乃父的内幕，究屬如何，而社會上一般的評判，又如何，我原不得而知，我就拿這件事所發表的情形，與現在社會上青年的病態心理，不能不加以批判，顧珍先在日本洋行爲買辦，九一八事變發生，不肯辭職，一二八事變發生，又不肯辭職，在顧珍先利欲薰心，甘爲奸商，鐵案如山，原是無言可説。</p>
<p>但承佑何人，是顧珍先之子，古人所謂事父母幾諫，幾者微也，在現在舊禮教打倒之下，天然再説不到幾微的字，現在承佑勸告其父，勿聽，假鐵血團名義警告，又勿聽，在顧珍先維利是圖，天良喪盡，的確不齒於人類，不過顧承佑與珍先到底有些血統關係，假定顧承佑而果能大義滅親，不願作奸商之子</p>
<p>，應該登報聲明，脱離父子關係，自去别尋生路，這也是一種光明的辦法。</p>
<p>現在承佑到永安公司選購貨物，送往家中，一次退回，二次再送，在承佑的心理，天然欲與家庭搗蛋，並不是與公司搗蛋，然而公司受了許多麻煩，自當與你算賬，不過我觀察現在的青年，每有揮霍無度，向父要求，要求不遂，乃假借名義、藉端恐嚇，此種行爲，往往而有，顧承佑平日行爲如何，我不曉得，不過我對於顧承佑揀選貨物，送往家中，此種行爲，毫無意識，决不似有理性的青年子弟所爲。</p>
<p>故愛國爲一事，而搗亂家庭亦爲一事，决不算能奸商之子，與父反對，就算認爲其子行爲之正當，不過此種行爲，出諸奸商之子，就算是一種報應，所謂有其父有其子。</p>

<p>— 鹿</p>
<p>［無線電話］［無線電報］，這些名字，我們差不多聽得快厭了，而且也看過不知多少次了，但是［無線電燈］這個新鮮的名字，雖然在這科學很發逹的二十世紀中，究竟還是没有聽見過的一件夢想的東西而己丨現在我突然寫了這個怪題目，我想諸位一定會驚奇起來，或者要疑惑起來，説就是［電筒］［汽油燈］［煤油燈］［：：：：］等的改名罷了！但是我之所謂［無線電燈］，不是像你們所猜度的一樣，現在且待我慢慢説來，</p>
<p>原來電燈是由兩根電線傅導電流到燈泡裏而發出光來的一件東西，這是誰也知道的，再也用不到我來説，而我之所謂［無線電燈］也就是這樣的一件東西，不過牠所需要的電流是從兩根細得幾乎看不出來的電線傅導過來的，簡直像無線的一樣，根本還是不外乎一種有線電燈，只是一套有趣的科學把戲，拆穿西洋鏡的説一聲，不過騙騙人罷了！</p>
<p>方法是很簡單的，只要尋舊花線一根（長短不計），把牠外面包着的紗綫及</p>
<p>橡皮等很小心地用小刀刮去，切不可將當中銅絲割斷，刮净後，將這支銅絲一絲絲分開來，每兩絲交盤結成一絲（因爲單獨一絲太細，容易斷去），同樣的做成兩條長絲：（長短以離接電處遠近爲定），結好後，在兩絲上各塗些膠水，以免分裂，再拿普通用的大燈泡和燈頭各一只，及一呎左右的花線一條，所用的材料，這樣就算足夠了，</p>
<p>只要把花樣一頭的兩端接在燈頭上：然後裝上燈泡，他一頭的兩端徐徐照交紋分開，到兩端離開得三四吋左右，不致互相接觸爲止：再把牠們釘在靠着桌子的壁上，用紙張把線部裱住，使不致爲他人察覺，燈泡放在桌上：然後將這兩條細銅絲的一端，接在這短花線的他一頭的兩端，細銅絲的他兩端接在通電流的電線上：（接時須關住總門，並且兩絲須離開數吋，以免危險），其中所經過的路線，必須沿壁或其他稳妥之處，不可懸空，以防危險，如所經過的路綫中有轉灣潮濕等處，可用絶緣體隔絶之，或先用花綫上刮下完整的橡皮圈，套上細絲，分别放在這種地方。全部的裝置，於此告終了！</p>
<p>不過還須細細檢查，有無不妥當的地方，如果没有了，就可以將開關開放，燈自然亮了！（光亮與普通用粗電綫傅電的燈，不相上下），要是你裝得很完備很適的話，，那别人無論如何是不會懂你秘密的，除非你告訴他：這種電燈雖然有綫，却好像無綫的一樣，所以我才説［無綫電燈］呢！讀者到此，也許要説一聲［滑頭貨］吧！哈哈！</p>

<h3 id="c209">託兒所的我見 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 祖娥</p>
<p>吾君的［託兒所］提議，用意殊佳，因不辭淺陋，也來談談這件事。</p>
<p>託元所在中國可説早己有設施了，育嬰堂者是也，只不過這種設施，完全屬於慈善性質，且在於某種限度之下的，所以旨志就不同了，且内容辦理不得其法。弊害叢生。遂鮮注意，而未由改善之。</p>
<p>本來育嬰堂的普遍，在我國可稱隨地隨處都有設備的，這一種極優良的社會福利事業，要是能利用而改善之，眞是一樁妙事。</p>
<p>託兒所的設施，原因父母者的爲了社會事業，或有其他牽連而不能顧到育養兒童的任務時需要的，藉集團的管理方法，拿一種義務丨即予相當金錢與託兒所丨去安頓了嬰孩，可專心致力於自己的事業，這種的方法，確實是新社會中一樁新的發現。但是託兒所的設置，非有健全的社會，很難實現的丨蘇俄有着不同的組織與社會情形，所以在那邊的嬰孩，一生下來，就可交託給社會的公衆，他那裏的育嬰所，自工廠中學校裏，及至公共娱樂所或公園都有設置着，在一種相當的過程中，進幼穉園，進小學，進中學及至大學，都不要你顧應一些，因爲他們雖形式上還是有着個别的家庭，而各人的重心却都己傾向在社會公衆了。不過在中國，情形自然不同了，但是事業與育養不能兼顧之下，對於託兒所的需要，實亦未便或緩呀！因依愚所見，將固有的育嬰堂，澈底的改變一下，改得科學化，社會化，兹録改善的意見如左：</p>
<p>育嬰堂本來的宗旨：是爲了生了下來不能育養將被遺棄收留下來代養的，一方面再以此餘剩的嬰孩，供給一般没有子嗣的來領養，這種精神，自然不應廢棄，只不過權擇名曰［託兒所慈善部］，是專本此志去進行的。另外呢，就是專以代人養育，而須有相當的代價，譬如一個須代託養的嬰孩，每年應缴各項費用若干？所中當詳爲定之，並得在各項費用下，加收若干，作爲慈善部之用，（此處或另籌募亦可）</p>
<p>管理方法，當然要力求完善，過去育嬰堂的管理腐敗，實在不興丨像一個不健全的乳母，哺了不少的嬰孩，或則愚拙而野蠻的婦人，作爲保姆，這些都能影響兒童幸福，所以如乳母，保母等須受有相當教育或訓練。其他如房屋應寛敝清潔，與及園林和曠塲須廣大：總之，關於兒童有福利的應盡善盡美，（但不過不能過於貴族化！這樣，不將要影響到兒童本身嗎？）</p>
<p>這些是我改育嬰堂爲託兒所的意見，一來藉育嬰堂固有的範圍改充之，比較易舉，二來託兒所中的組織依然不廢棄育嬰原來的慈善性質，一舉二得，或在於斯？願諸君討論之。</p>

<p>是問他何以能有四五十元一月的進欵，理髮匠道，［我們一天中間平均可理十一二個客人的理髮，每人以大洋二角計，即有二元四角，和老板四六折算，那末我們一天可以有一元四角四分，每月豈不是可以有四十餘元嗎，而且飯由老板供給的呢，但是我看看一般學校裏教書先生，小學的每月十餘元，多至二十餘元，中學的有的也不過四十餘左右，而且還有自己吃飯，飯資又起碼六七元，他們賺錢實際上不及我們，但是己經要化掉不少的資本哩，我們有何資本可言，他們還要時常傾軋，閙風潮，眞不若我們的安分，所以我們的地位，雖是低些，但是同樣的是職業，職業是没有高下的，我們也很又自慰了］我聽了他一番話，不僅輕輕地嘆道，讀書有什麽用，我們爲什麽要讀書，唉！小學教員眞不如一個理髮匠呢，</p>

<p>暑假之前，本埠某中學快要舉行畢業考試的時候，某生召集了平常要好的同學，在他家中，開秘密會議。他做了當然主席，宣告開會的宗旨道：［現在快要舉行畢業考試了，我們幾位朋友，平常功課都不見得好，這次如不得畢業，不是很倒霉的嗎？］</p>
<p>［是呀，］甲生接上來道：［那末我們除開夜車，没有别的方法。］</p>
<p>［開夜車還來得及嗎？］乙生好似明白了某生的心意，這樣説道：［要開你一個人去開，我是最不願意開夜車的。］</p>
<p>［你們聽我説，］某生笑嬉嬉的説：［我有個極好的方法呢！只要照我的方法去做，包你們個個畢業。］</p>
<p>［什麽方法？什麽方法？］都一齊忙着詢問起來。</p>
<p>［校中油印考卷的三個校工那裏，我們只要送他們一點錢，呌他們預先偷出考卷來，這方法還不好嗎？大概每人十元儘夠了。一共三十元，我們六個人分派，每人只須五元好了，便當不便當啦？］</p>
<p>［這個方法好極！］大家都贊成。</p>
<p>三個校工的袋裏，各人裝進兩張五元的鈔票之後，物理，化學，歷史：：：</p>
<p>的考卷，就一張一張的飛了出來。考試的結果，這六位平常功課不好的朋友，這次倒好的異乎尋常。校長正有些懷疑，其他勢難分肥的校工，因看了鈔票眼紅，隐隐露出口風來。校長擺出大老爺的架子，把三個校工傅來嚴訊，他們都直認受賄作弊。於是這三位可憐無知的校工，在校長大老爺的雷霆之下，立即滾蛋。但是這六個學生呢，因種種關係，仍與以畢業：仍與以一樣的畢業。</p>
<p>這件事，究屬是誰之過呢？不是六個學生之過，更不是三個晦氣的校工之過，實在是學校當局之過：尤其是訓育主任。這種不幸事情的發生，可以説是學校無訓育，也可以説是學校的訓育整個的破産！</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Japanese Will Officially Recognize the Puppet State <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>According to a Reuters Tokyo dispatch, the Japanese will formally recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo on September 18, the anniversary of the Mukden Incident. They will also conclude a basic treaty with the puppet state. The draft of the treaty will be submitted to the League of Nations Secretariat for registration. The contents of the treaty are approximately as follows: (1) The national defense of the puppet state of Manchukuo will be handled entirely by Japan. (2) The operation of all railways in Manchuria will be managed by the South Manchuria Railway. (3) The puppet state of Manchukuo shall inherit all treaties previously signed by China. (4) All Japanese rights in Manchuria should be incorporated into the treaty as much as possible. (5) All Japanese currently serving as officials in the puppet state of Manchukuo will be given adequate protection. (6) Japanese people should have freedom of travel, residence, and commerce in Manchuria. It is also heard that when Mutō was sent to Manchuria, Uchida had already instructed Mutō on the main points of the treaty.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, our country has entrusted the responsibility of resolving it to the League of Nations, seeking a peaceful solution based on the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. However, over the past year, the aggressors have not only shown no signs of repentance but have intensified their actions. On the one hand, they aggressively invaded with guns and cannons, and on the other hand, they fabricated the puppet state of Manchukuo to deceive the world. At the same time, they have proclaimed that Japan has no territorial ambitions and respects the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty contains provisions such as "[China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity]," "[No spheres of influence shall be created in China]," and "[Chinese railways shall not be subject to unfair treatment]." The Kellogg-Briand Pact contains a provision that "[War shall not be used as an instrument of national policy]." Furthermore, the League of Nations Covenant contains a provision that "[Those who submit to public adjudication and decisions shall not resort to war against them]." Considering Japan's past actions and the basic treaty it will conclude with the puppet state this time, none of them are consistent with the spirit of the treaties and Japan's previous promise of "[no territorial ambitions]." However, today, when Uchida made a speech on diplomatic policy in the Diet, he claimed that Japan's dispatch of troops to the Northeast did not violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but instead cunningly argued that it was an explosion under unbearable circumstances. At the same time, he further claimed that the recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo does not conflict with the Nine-Power Treaty, but instead argued that the Nine-Power Treaty cannot prohibit the people of a region in China from initiating and establishing an independent country. Therefore, today Japan's recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo does not contradict the Nine-Power Treaty. Truly, facts are facts, and rhetoric is rhetoric. Who can believe that their words and deeds are consistent? We still remember that in the resolution of the League of Nations Special Assembly, there is a sentence: "[Actions that trample on the territorial integrity of members of the League and change their political independence cannot be recognized as effective by members of the League]." Moreover, the resolution also stated that the League members cannot recognize the status, treaties, or agreements obtained through methods that violate the League Covenant and the Pact of Paris. Therefore, the Japanese's cunning and clumsy schemes have long been recognized by people all over the world.</p>
<p>Now, let us further discuss the international situation of Japan's recognition of the puppet state. First, let's discuss the attitude between Japan and Russia. Recently, Russia's lifeline in the Far East is Siberia and Outer Mongolia. The interests in northern Manchuria are only secondary to them. Therefore, if Japan can peacefully satisfy itself with seizing Manchuria, then Russia will not likely make things difficult for Japan, or even follow in Japan's footsteps and recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo. It is recently rumored in Washington that Japan and Russia have reached a new understanding, the content of which is: (1) Japan recognizes and protects Russia's rights in the Chinese Eastern Railway. (2) Japan restricts the actions of the Japanese army on the Siberian border and in Mongolia. (3) Japan protects Russia's commercial interests in Manchuria and Mongolia. If this news is true, then there is a possibility that Japan and Russia will temporarily join hands and stand on the same battle line. Let's talk about the attitude between Japan and the United States. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan and the United States have always stood in an adversarial position. On the 8th of this month, Stimson's speech at the New York Foreign Affairs Discussion Group fully expressed his attitude. In his speech, he declared that he would absolutely not recognize the situation created by force, intending to encourage the League of Nations to take strong action against Japan. However, the Japanese have never made a formal verbal statement on this. However, Japan's decisive recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo this time actually contains the meaning of protesting to the United States with facts. Therefore, it is undoubtedly certain that the diplomacy between Japan and the United States will further deteriorate after the puppet state is recognized. Recently, Japan's diplomatic policy advocates allying with Russia and rejecting the United States, which shows that it deeply understands this situation. In addition, the attitudes of European countries towards China and Japan are either biased towards Japan or strictly adhere to their ambiguous positions. Even if one or two small countries offer sympathy and assistance to our country, it is still a drop in the bucket and will not help.</p>
<p>Therefore, although all countries regard the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo as a puppet show, who is willing to speak out for China? Even the future deterioration of the relationship between Japan and the United States will only result in one or two written protests. For the present plan, our country can only seize the opportunity when the puppet state has not been recognized or is about to be recognized, and do its best to recover the lost territory. We must not continue to seek help from others with an attitude of complacency. As the painful anniversary of September 18th is approaching, we should quickly realize the mistakes of the past and be vigilant.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Many Mongolian bandits who have been bought by the Japanese side and have been harassing the border of Jehol for a long time are strong men from Tumut Left Banner, Tumut Right Banner, and Alakqin Right Banner. Recently, they are unwilling to be used by the Japanese and have gathered more than 8,000 people with complete weapons and equipment provided by the Japanese side. They have all rebelled and surrendered to the Jehol authorities, willing to serve as the vanguard against Japan. (Special telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from Chinese people in Jehol received today, 800 Mongolian cavalrymen initially agreed to be loyal to Japan, but now they support the Republic again. These people have received a large amount of Japanese military equipment and ammunition and are now assisting the Volunteer Army in combat. According to non-official sources in Jehol, the Japanese army is still occupying Nanling. The Chinese army has set up the first line of defense in Koubeiyingzi. It is heard that the Chinese army in Chaoyang has received assistance from the city factory and has fortified all dangerous points between Chaoyang and Beipiao. (Reuters telegram on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to the Volunteer Army, they are now preparing to attack Xinmin again in order to approach Shenyang and join forces with the Volunteer Army near there. It is heard that several small areas along the Haicheng Railway have been captured by the Volunteer Army. The Japanese have sent troops to resist this new factory. The Volunteer Army attempted to destroy the railway and bridge over the Raoyang River, but they were discovered by the Japanese soldiers, who opened fire and drove them away.

<p>(Nanjing) Political news: There has been no change in the Jehol issue in recent days. According to general speculation, there may be no drastic changes in the near future, but it is believed that serious disputes may arise before the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly. The Japanese side has now decided to act recklessly to the end, formally recognizing the rebels. On the one hand, after Mutō arrived in Shenyang, he tried to eliminate the Volunteer Army outside the customs from invading Jehol to expand the incident and achieve his ambition to annex the eastern provinces. It is heard that the central government has paid close attention to this and is carefully planning countermeasures. (Central News Agency telegram on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) People from Suizhong said that the Japanese army is constantly afraid of attacks by the National Salvation Army. Every day, they send five to twenty planes to bomb the towns of Laodougou, Peijiangou, Erdaogou, Toudaogou, Huquanshan, Fenglushan, Zidiaoyushifan, Xiaominzhuangzi, Simen, Jiumentai, Xiaohukou, Shanshuiying, Shizhuizi, Sifangtai, Fengyinzhuang, Yonganbao, Dadianzi, Ligentai, Tiaoshigou, Gushanzi, Zhanglangcong, Dingzigou, Shunshanbao, Matigou, Pingchuanying, Shuangshanzi, Dajialou, Tiefangbao, Songlingzi, Niuyangou, Wangjiagou, etc. The lives and property of local residents have suffered great losses.

<p>(Shenyang) At 10:55 last night, the lead locomotive of the second train from Shenyang to Busan derailed and overturned between the bridgehead and Nanfen on the Anfeng Line because the railway track was destroyed by the Volunteer Army. More than a hundred Volunteer Army soldiers lurking nearby immediately launched an attack. The members of the Lianshanguan garrison on the train also rose up to fight back. After a fierce battle for 30 minutes, they were finally repelled. At that time, two soldiers and three railway section members were slightly injured and were immediately taken to the bridgehead hospital for treatment. The Lianshanguan garrison was dispatched after hearing the news. Although they are currently in pursuit, the extent of the railway line that has been destroyed is unexpectedly wide, and there is no hope of restoration for the time being. Because this is before the full appointment of Mutō, the South Manchuria Railway and related parties are under extremely strict guard and are in a state of great tension.

<p>(Beiping) The Tongliao Volunteer Army planned to recapture Zhangwu County, but failed because the Japanese army used tanks to resist the enemy after fighting for a whole day. Although the attack on Zhangwu was temporarily unsuccessful, the Volunteer Army is now gathering troops to try to attack again. At the same time, a large number of Volunteer Army soldiers are now attacking Xinluntun (transliteration) next to the Beining Railway line outside the customs. The activities of the Volunteer Army have caused panic in Shenyang. Several plainclothes soldiers have entered Shenyang to start an uprising. The Japanese side has imposed martial law.

<p>Resolved to Have Song Acting as the Premier</p>
<p>Telegraphed Condolences to Ma Fuxiang's Family</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a standing committee meeting on the morning of the 25th. More than 20 people, including Ye Chucang, Wang Zhaoming, and Chen Guofu, attended. Wang Zhaoming chaired the meeting. In addition to discussing routine cases, regarding the issue of the premier, it was resolved that Vice Premier Song will act as the premier. Also, Ma Fuxiang passed away due to illness. It was resolved: (1) The Central Government will send a telegram to express condolences to his family. (2) Ma's contributions to the revolution during his lifetime will be publicized in party history, and Wang Zhaoming will be recommended to report on the Central Memorial Week next week. (Central News Agency telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Premier Wang resigned, the Central Government resolved on the morning of the 25th that Song Ziwen will act as the premier. However, Song is in charge of financial planning and it will be difficult for him to act for a long time. It is heard that the central government intends to persuade Wang to resume his post in the short term in order to coordinate the overall situation and cope with the serious internal and external situation, as the Jehol issue may undergo serious changes at any time and the League of Nations General Assembly is also approaching.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding Japan's preparations to formally recognize the puppet organization of Manchuria, Wang Jingwei raised it for discussion at the meeting of the Central Standing Committee on the 25th to discuss countermeasures. All members unanimously advocated that if Japan implements recognition, our government will make a particularly serious statement and declare to the world its absurd actions that violate all covenants of the League of Nations and undermine our country's territorial integrity to clarify responsibility.

<p>Nanjing Wang Jingwei told reporters after the adjournment of the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 25th that the Third Plenary Session was originally scheduled to be held in September, but because eight or nine members are currently engaged in bandit suppression work and it is difficult for them to come to Beijing, it must be postponed. However, the deadline is within this year. The issue will definitely be raised for discussion at the Central Discussion Conference next Monday. Regarding the situation in Jehol, according to telegrams, only small-scale military conflicts involving a company or platoon have occurred. The Japanese army has not launched a large-scale offensive. In June, when I and Li Renchao were in Beiping, we discussed with Zhang Hanqing the allocation of more than 100,000 troops, at least 50,000 to 60,000 troops, to deploy on the border of Jehol to strengthen national defense and prepare for any eventuality. Although Zhang accepted, he did not actually follow this plan. Now the generals in North China have unanimously become excited and are prepared to resist. If the Japanese army approaches, they will naturally engage in armed conflict without hesitation. (Special telegram on the 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e18">The Sino-American Arbitration Treaty Aims to End War <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-American Arbitration Treaty passed by the Central Political Council yesterday was initiated by the United States after the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, with the aim of ending international war. It stipulates that all disputes between the signatory countries should be submitted to arbitration and should not resort to force. Many European countries have signed this treaty with the United States, and there are already six or seven countries. Its signing with our country was also done long ago during Wu Chaochu's tenure as ambassador to the United States and was formally approved by the US government. However, it has not taken effect because our country has not yet ratified it. As for the method of submitting to arbitration, there are two: 1. Submitting to the Hague Court of Arbitration for resolution in accordance with the law. 2. The two countries jointly establish an arbitration institution to adjudicate impartially. The above two methods differ due to the different relationships between the signatory countries, so the regulations are also different. The provisions set by our country this time are roughly the same as those set by other countries. After review by the Legislative Yuan, it will be submitted to the National Government for approval and promulgation. (Special telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-American Arbitration Treaty was started and signed during Wu Chaochu's tenure as ambassador to the United States, and the Central Government submitted the treaty to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Yuan's 110th meeting resolved to submit it to the Foreign Affairs Committee for review. Later, because the majority of the committee members advocated postponing the discussion, it was delayed for two years. Now that this case has been passed by the Central Political Council and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review, it only needs to go through legislative procedures to be approved and promulgated. (Special telegram on the 25th) (Nanjing) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to meet on the 26th to review the Sino-American Arbitration Treaty case in order to submit it to the Yuan's meeting for discussion.

<p>(Nanjing) The Shanghai Public Concession Special District Court Agreement is scheduled to expire on March 31 next year after three years. The government believes that the content of the agreement is not fully in line with our country's legal sovereignty and believes that it is necessary to revise it. It has decided to propose revisions to the relevant countries. Last month, Luo Wengan went to Shanghai to inspect the court and has prepared to carry out the procedures. According to the agreement, the other party should be notified six months before the expiration, so that they can discuss it in detail within the six-month period. Therefore, this notification will be sent to the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil to China by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before October of this year to discuss the process.

<p>(Beiping) Dr. Andrews, the leader of the Central Asia Expedition Team, is now planning to wait for the situation to stabilize and set off from [Manchukuo] again to explore for the ancestors of [Peking Man] fossils, which he estimates to have lived between one million and six million years ago. The doctor believes that this primitive man can be found on the eastern end of the Central Asian Plateau, which extends directly to [Manchukuo]. The doctor insists that the age and condition of the strata in this area are appropriate and said that if we want to find primitive man, we must find it in this area, or even right under our feet. A Reuters reporter met with the doctor today, who claimed that the [Manchukuo] government has agreed to assist in the implementation of his work. The doctor also expressed dissatisfaction with the Chinese government's obstruction of his work. The doctor is scheduled to leave for the United States next week.

<p>(Shanhaiguan) Honjō is about to return to his country, and Mutō is about to come to the domain. The puppet state is preparing for the farewell ceremony in an extremely arrogant manner. On the 24th, Puyi and other important figures of the puppet state, led by Komai, held a farewell meeting for the officers of the Kwantung Army at the Yamato Hotel in Changchun, and created a meritorious service medal for the founding of the country to be awarded to all Japanese troops who invaded and occupied the Northeast.

<p>Their Actions Are Closely Watched by the Japanese</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The American banking group arrived in Shenyang today and stayed at the Yamato Hotel. The Japanese were very uneasy and secretly monitored their actions. Although the banking group said on the surface that they came for investment investigation, the Japanese were very suspicious of their actions. Because the group's report can influence the US government's policy toward Japan, the Japanese have to express their welcome on the surface, although they are secretly on guard. The banking group said that the purpose of this trip was for investment investigation and there was no other intention. As for whether Americans can invest in the three eastern provinces, it depends on the results of the investigation. It is a fact that there is too much idle capital in the United States and there are no investment projects in the country. Although the recent fall in the Japanese currency is conducive to investment, security and business protection are closely related to investment, so it cannot be clearly expressed.

<h3 id="e78">Uchida's Absurd and Arrogant Diplomatic Remarks on China <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Declares that the Japanese Government is Prepared to Immediately Recognize the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Sophistry that Military Actions Do Not Violate International Conventions</p>
<p>Aiding Dong Provinces to Independence is Actually Referred to as the Result of a Separatist Movement</p>
<p>Arbitrarily Attacks Our Revolutionary Government, Hoping to Confuse World Opinion</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 25th – Japanese Foreign Minister Yasuya Uchida today gave a speech at the Diet on diplomatic policy, first explaining the diplomatic developments after the September 18th Incident and announcing that Japan will soon recognize the puppet organization, saying that ["Manchukuo"] is the result of the disintegration of Chinese politics, denying that Japan created the puppet state, strongly arguing that it does not violate the Nine-Power Treaty or the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In his conclusion, Uchida announced Japan's new foreign policy, which is to establish a Monroe Doctrine in the Far East with the cooperation of Japan, ["Manchukuo"], and China to maintain peace in the Far East, trying hard to conceal the fact that Japan is destroying peace in the Far East. What is most noteworthy is that regarding the cause of the September 18th Incident, what Uchida said contradicts what former Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara said before.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th – Foreign Minister Uchida's remarks in the Diet this morning, in brief, said: "What we are gratified about is that ["Manchukuo"] is now entering a steady and progressive process. The Japanese government firmly believes that Japan's recognition of this new country is the only way to fix permanent peace in the Far East. In order to recognize ["Manchukuo"] as soon as possible, we have made various preparations, and will implement them as soon as the preparations are completed. However, other countries do not fully understand Japan's attitude toward China and the plans that Japan has adopted after the September 18th Incident last year, and do not know the truth about the establishment of ["Manchukuo"], and regard Japan's recognition of ["Manchukuo"] as illegal actions. I am now taking this opportunity to explain Japan's position and explain to you the reasons why the government regards recognition of ["Manchukuo"] as the only way to solve the problem of the three eastern provinces. There is no denying that the chaotic situation within China and the revolutionary policies implemented by China are the reasons for the unfortunate changes in international relations in the Far East in recent years. Although Japan has made the greatest sacrifices in the extraordinary situation in China, other countries have also suffered unbearable insults and incalculable material losses. At the same time, all those who are familiar with the current situation in China admit that no relief method can be obtained to cure it, whether by using the League of Nations Charter or other so-called peace organizations. In fact, the great powers often directly use force, and do not rely on this kind of peace tool to correct or prevent the harm to their important rights in China. This habit has been around for a long time. For twenty years, Japan has continued to be extremely patient, hoping that China can rectify its internal affairs and fulfill its corresponding responsibility for maintaining peace in the Far East. However, China has not only failed to sincerely reciprocate our goodwill and hope, but its arrogant attitude has become even more unbearable. The Japanese government has repeatedly warned the Chinese government that if it provokes the Japanese people to the point where they can no longer tolerate it, the result will be extremely dangerous. However, China ignored these warnings, and then the September 18th Northeast Incident occurred, the place where it occurred was on Japan's first lifeline, and the time of its occurrence was when the Japanese people were repeatedly provoked and indignant to the point where they could no longer bear it. At this point, we had no other way but to take self-defense actions. There are now some people who say that Japan's actions violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but this statement has no basis in fact. I have said that Japan was forced to take necessary actions to protect important rights related to Japan's national survival, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact does not have any restrictions on the exercise of the right of self-defense, such as Japan's actions in the Northeast. The treaty also does not restrict the contracting states from taking actions that each country deems necessary to avoid crises that endanger their land and interests. The exercise of the right of self-defense by a country can be extended</p>

<p>outside its territory. This is extremely obvious. Japan's actions are no different from the means taken by other countries in the same situation in other places. Because of the Chinese side's attack, after the Japanese army took legitimate and necessary actions, the officials under Zhang Xueliang's rule in the three eastern provinces either resigned or fled. As a result, Zhang Xueliang's government no longer exists. Therefore, in the three eastern provinces, people who were generally dissatisfied with Zhang Xueliang and opposed dragging the three eastern provinces into the vortex of civil war began a political reform movement. These people took advantage of Zhang Xueliang's overthrow to start activities. This is a natural reason. Therefore, organizations for maintaining public order were established in Shenyang, Harbin, and other places. In view of Japan's responsibility to maintain public order in Manchuria, we expressed cooperation with the maintenance associations in various places. Therefore, the founding of Manchuria was the decision of the local leaders of Manchuria, and the establishment of ["Manchukuo"] was the result of a separatist movement, and also because Manchuria's geography, history, and people's psychology are different from China's. Those who want to say that the independence of the three eastern provinces is directly due to the actions of the Japanese army, and that Japan should be responsible for the revolution in the three eastern provinces, do not understand the facts, and their opinions are contrary to the facts. There are also people who, seeing that many Japanese officials are employed in the ["Manchukuo"] government, suspect that the Japanese side has some secret relationship in the foundation of the new country. I can only tell these people that it is common for a newly organized government or a newly established country to hire foreigners. There are many precedents for this. The establishment of ["Manchukuo"] is the result of a separatist movement within China itself. I have already said this. Therefore, the view held by some parties that Japan's recognition of such a newly established country destroys the clauses of the Nine-Power Treaty is, in my opinion, very incomprehensible. If we assume that Japan wants to annex the three eastern provinces, or wants to satisfy its desire to open up land, then this matter would of course be different. I am now not afraid of being verbose, and repeatedly deny here that Japan has any intention of opening up territory in the three eastern provinces or elsewhere. Japan's attitude toward China and the plans adopted after the September 18th Incident are all fair and appropriate. The independence of the three eastern provinces was created by the natural desire of the people of the three eastern provinces, and must be regarded as the aftermath of a separatist movement within China. Japan's recognition of the new country does not destroy the clauses of the Nine-Power Treaty. I have already explained the gist of all this. As for the question of finding a solution to the problem of the three eastern provinces, the Japanese government believes that the following two points are extremely important: First, in seeking a satisfactory solution, we must aim to (A) realize the legitimate wishes of the people of the three eastern provinces, (B) fully guarantee Japan's rights, (C) prevent the recurrence of anti-foreign policies and movements, so that the three eastern provinces can be a place where the people of the Northeast and foreigners can live in peace, and (D) not only stabilize the three eastern provinces, but also maintain permanent peace in the Far East. The second point is that this solution must be based on the actual situation in the current situation, and must exclude all emotional arguments and abstract ideals. Now some parties seem to be considering a method to grant the power over the three eastern provinces to the Chinese mainland in some form, to temporarily perfunctorily solve the problem. It is necessary to know that this method would only cause the situation before the September 18th Incident to reappear in the future. We have learned from the previous tragic experience, and the Japanese people will never allow this kind of solution. It is not fair and unwise to impose on the three eastern provinces what the people of the three eastern provinces do not want to have, because it only sows the seeds of disaster in the future. The method of granting the jurisdiction of the three eastern provinces to the Chinese mainland, and any plan that is equally perfunctory and conventional, can never achieve the goal of making the three eastern provinces a happy place for local people and foreigners, nor can it conform to Japan's principle of seeking a solution based on the actual situation in the current situation. ["Manchukuo"] has proceeded in a common and open and honest procedure, has declared a policy of fairness, peace, and friendship to foreign countries, promises to accept the obligations of existing treaties in accordance with international law and customs, respect the existing rights of foreigners, protect their people and property, welcome foreigners, and treat them equally regardless of race, abide by the open door policy, promote international trade, and help promote the development of the world economy. The sincerity of ["Manchukuo"]'s aspirations has been earnestly established. Therefore, formally recognizing ["Manchukuo"] and helping its government implement the above-mentioned stable policies is a noble step that can make the three eastern provinces a happy place for local people and foreigners based on the actual situation. It is clear that if ["Manchukuo"] always adheres to the spirit of its founding and maintains its noble aspirations, then its future is very promising. As for the financial position of ["Manchukuo"], I heard that it is not bad, and it is actually better than it was at the beginning. With its vast land, prosperous people, and rich natural resources, ["Manchukuo"] has a good government, and there is no doubt that it can become a rich and prosperous country and enter the world market. I hope that the steady development of ["Manchukuo"] will not only make the 30 million people in the Northeast happy and prosperous, but also serve as a good model for the revival of the Chinese mainland."</p>
<p>The World News Agency said that according to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, at the upcoming meeting of the Japanese Diet, Foreign Minister Uchida will announce the so-called ["Far East Monroe Doctrine"]. The purpose of this doctrine is the cooperation between China, ["Manchukuo"], and Japan to maintain and promote peace in the Far East. The Far East problem must be solved by the Far East itself. The announcement of this doctrine is tantamount to warning the Western powers not to interfere in Eastern affairs, and it is also tantamount to secretly telling the League of Nations and the League of Nations Investigation Commission to withdraw their hands of intervention in all matters in the Far East. How this declaration will cause repercussions overseas is worth noting.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Uchida's Speech Reaches London <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Not Highly Valued</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 25th - Lord Cecil stated today that he had reviewed the speech by Japanese Foreign Minister Count Uchida and felt it best not to comment on it at this time, as the points mentioned in the speech would likely be discussed at Geneva in the future. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Minister to London, stated that the venue for judging the status of the Three Eastern Provinces was Geneva, not Tokyo, and both China and Japan must appear in court to be judged. Minister Guo also said that Japan had been working hard to create and increase turmoil in China, while China was steering a steady course, thus able to navigate the world through stormy seas. The politician who made this speech was the very person who signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact against war. Now, he is using the protection of Japanese interests as an excuse to say that the Japanese army should exercise power in foreign territory. This is symbolic of Japan's current political situation.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 25th - The summaries of Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida's speech in the Diet defending Japanese policy were published in the newspapers this morning. Only The Times paid much attention to it because British attention is currently focused on the situation in Germany, the results of the Ottawa Conference, and the Lancashire cotton industry dispute. The newspapers did not criticize this speech, clearly because they already knew the Japanese position. What was said has no new meaning. The idea of Japan recognizing [Manchukuo] has been a long-standing rumor, so it is not highly valued, and officialdom does not want to comment. The Japanese currency continues to weaken, and Japanese bonds remain low.</p>

<p>Reuter's, Tokyo, 25th - Prime Minister Viscount Saito's speech in the Diet today was brief but very important. The Prime Minister only briefly mentioned the Three Eastern Provinces issue. His speech focused on explaining the government's various plans to relieve national difficulties, especially focusing on farmers, fishermen, small businesses, and merchants in the middle. The Prime Minister announced the government's policy of unifying the administration of the Three Eastern Provinces and said that Japan is now preparing to recognize [Manchukuo] as soon as possible. The Prime Minister said about this issue, "From a diplomatic point of view, it is gratifying for Japan, a neighboring country, to see the newly established [Manchukuo] making steady and sound progress. The government, in accordance with the resolution passed by the previous session of the House of Representatives, is now actively preparing to formally recognize [Manchukuo]." The Prime Minister then spoke about unifying the administration of the Three Eastern Provinces, saying, "The necessity of properly managing the various Japanese institutions in Manchuria with appropriate plans has long been recognized. We have now appointed a leader for these institutions. In the future, we may implement corresponding plans according to the actual situation there. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the Japanese soldiers who have devoted themselves to restoring peace and order in the Three Eastern Provinces." The Prime Minister then mentioned the Emperor's donation of money to relieve the poor and sick and to promote scientific research. He then said that the government has decided on a three-year plan to alleviate economic difficulties, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Provide low-interest loans so that currency can circulate smoothly and compensate for the losses suffered by various institutions providing financing. (2) Consider extending the repayment of loan principal and interest and financing to reorganize farmers' debts. (3) Organize new agricultural and forestry projects, build new roads, and repair old roads to provide work for the unemployed and at the same time improve transportation. (4) Increase credit loans for rice purchases, encourage stockpiling of grain, and assist silkworm farmers and silk reelers. (5) Provide free lunches for students who cannot afford to provide their own. Finally, the Prime Minister mentioned that the government plans to encourage immigration and urged farmers and the whole country to adopt a self-help policy to overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Takahashi Reports on Fiscal Plan <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Reuter's, Tokyo, 25th - Finance Minister Takahashi spoke in the Diet today after the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister spoke and proposed an increased budget of 176 million yen to fund rural relief. He said that in addition to this amount, local areas would need to raise 87 million yen for the same purpose. The former will be raised by issuing public bonds, and the latter will be covered by government loans at low interest rates. Most of the Seiyukai (政友會) are not satisfied with this proposal. Some government councilors are now planning to impeach the government on the grounds that its emergency plan is completely inadequate. The Seiyukai's own plan calls for a total of 1.4 billion yen, with 200 million yen from the issuance of rice bonds and the remaining 1.2 billion yen, with 500 million yen for budget expenditures and 700 million yen for budget expenses. However, the Seiyukai does not agree on the plan to be adopted. The extremists favor a direct vote of no confidence in the government, while the rest advocate only passing a resolution warning the government. It is believed that there are only about 20 extremists, so the moderates can prevail and prevent the impeachment motion from being filed.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 25th - The House of Representatives convened at 1:00 PM. After the Speaker announced the opening of the meeting, the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister delivered their speeches. Mori Kaku of the Seiyukai then took the podium and began the first interpellation of this Diet session: (1) What is the extent and preparation of the government's recognition of Manchukuo? (2) Also, how will the international situation change when Japan recognizes Manchukuo under public law? Has this been determined, and what is the government's policy on this? (3) After the recognition of Manchukuo, will there be any changes in the Empire's position in international economics? (4) After the recognition of Manchukuo, have preparations been made to adapt to major changes in the diplomatic relations between China and Japan and other countries? Foreign Minister Uchida replied, "(1) The type and extent of preparation cannot be answered. (2) Our actions do not violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and if there are any changes in the situation, the whole country will unite to deal with them. There is nothing to fear." Next, Okuchi Kita questioned financial problems and exchange rate problems. Hamada Kunimatsu questioned personnel problems. At that time, the Seiyukai and Minseito (政民兩黨) were in great chaos, and screams arose in the hall. Prime Minister Saito was about to defend himself from his seat, but he was unable to do so due to the disruption. Then, Colonial Affairs Minister Nagai took the podium and replied that he could not bear to dismiss Director-General Kishimoto online in private, but for the sake of industrial revival, he had to choose someone with experience in colonial policy. At that time, disturbances arose again from the Seiyukai seats, and they did not listen to the Colonial Affairs Minister's reply. Amid the noise, the Colonial Affairs Minister stepped down from the podium. Nakano Seigō of the Nationalist Alliance then spoke, saying that the current cabinet is not a unified national cabinet, but a bureaucratic cabinet. The radical ideas held by young military officers are also a reflection of the social reality. However, the current cabinet's emergency relief measures and the fundamental reform of society are completely opposite. This is because the gentlemen of the current cabinet are bureaucrats and do not represent the will of the entire nation. Also, the previous Diet session had already resolved to recognize the diplomatic problem. It has been two months since then, but it has not yet been recognized. It must be said that the current cabinet does not respect the resolutions of the Diet. Finally, he touched on US Secretary of State Stimson's speech and asked how to deal with it. After Prime Minister Saito and Uchida replied, the meeting adjourned at 6:25 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Washington Widely Rumors a New Understanding Between Russia and Japan <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>A Victory for Japanese Diplomatic Maneuvering</p>
<p>World News Agency, Washington - Washington diplomatic circles are widely rumored about an unconfirmed message saying that a new agreement has been established between Russia and Japan, the contents of which relate to the rights and interests of the two countries in the Far East. Through this agreement, the Soviet Union is prepared to follow up and recognize [Manchukuo] after Japan recognizes it. US government officials said they have not received this report, but in light of various circumstances, they are already seriously considering this statement. The so-called various circumstances are that relations between Russia and Japan have greatly improved recently, especially the fisheries dispute has been resolved. According to diplomatic circles, the fisheries agreement has several new understandings attached: (1) Japan recognizes the rights of the railway party on the Chinese Eastern Railway. (2) Japan restricts Japanese military operations on the Siberian border and in Mongolia. (3) Russia's commercial interests in Manchuria and Mongolia are protected by Japan. Far East affairs experts regard this as a victory for Japanese diplomatic maneuvering because it greatly consolidates Japan's position.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 25th - The Spanish Supreme Court has sentenced General Sanjurjo to death. Three accomplices were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from 12 years to life. The government is now afraid that after the verdict is announced, the royalists will rise up and make trouble. It has ordered the police to be on strict alert and ordered the army to prepare in the camp, waiting to be mobilized in case of an alarm. Rumors have been rampant in the capital all night, with a sense of mutual fear, but fortunately, no disturbances have occurred so far. Valladolid and La Coruña are also under the same strict alert. All post offices, telegram offices, public offices, banks, etc., have been assigned additional guards. However, local authorities throughout the country believe that the public tends to be republican and believe that if any riots occur, it will not be difficult to quell them.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 25th - People in the German government have now determined that the official negotiations between the leaders of the National Socialist Party and the Center Party have not only reached a deadlock but have completely broken down. At least for a time, it is impossible to continue. Therefore, the only way for the government in the future is to dissolve the new parliament before it passes a vote of no confidence in the government. Currently, political figures in Berlin believe that after the parliament is dissolved, the current government will most likely continue to hold power and indefinitely postpone new elections because if new elections are held at this time, the results will still be the same as before. In this extraordinary period, extraordinary measures must be taken, even if they violate constitutional regulations.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 25th - A great disturbance broke out again in Beuthen, Upper Silesia, Germany, last night. Because rumors were spreading that the five National Socialist Party members sentenced to death would be secretly transferred to other places, more than 400 National Socialist Party members in uniform gathered in front of the court where the five men were being held, causing a great disturbance. It was not until the police opened fire at midnight, injuring 20 people and detaining nine National Socialist Party members, that order was restored. During the chaos, many Jewish shops and merchants were destroyed by National Socialist Party members. Afterwards, the Governor of Upper Silesia ordered this morning to strictly prohibit all meetings and demonstrations in front of the court, and even individuals are not allowed to engage in behaviors of a demonstrative nature in front of the court.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Japanese Securities Plunge <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Havas, London, 24th - Japanese securities prices fell another one or two points today. The Morning Star explained this by saying that it was due to the continued fall in the Japanese yen. In December last year, when Japan had not yet abandoned the gold standard, the Japanese yen to British exchange rate was about three shillings, but now it is only one shilling, three pence and 75. As for Japanese bonds, they have also fallen sharply compared to the highest prices this year, such as the 5.5% consolidated public bonds, which have fallen by as much as 36.25 points. The public believes that the number of Japanese budget deficits will be extremely large, and the fall in the Japanese yen and bonds is due to this.</p>

<p>Seeking a Way Out for Agricultural Products</p>
<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 24th - The Economic Research Committee established by the eight Eastern European agricultural countries of Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Estonia, and Latvia held its second meeting here today, so that the countries can adopt a common front within the Eastern European and Central European Economic Reconstruction Committee convened in Lausanne next month. Because the countries are aware that as a result of the Ottawa British Empire Conference, their agricultural products that cannot be sold in Central Europe and Germany have no hope of opening up new markets. Therefore, the heart of seeking a unified action to find a way out is becoming more and more urgent. Today, Poland's former Finance Minister Mieczysław Młynarski published an article in the semi-official Polish newspaper, advocating that since Eastern European agricultural countries are all debtor countries, they can declare that if creditors do not treat their agricultural products preferentially, they will not be able to repay their debts.</p>

<p>Suiyuan Correspondence - Liu Shouzhong, a member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, accompanied by secretaries Tan Chao-yi, Yang Jian-an, and Construction Director Feng Yi, Provincial Party Committee Zhao Yunyi, etc., departed from Suiyuan Province on the 13th to visit the Livelihood Canal, and to visit the Lama Cave in Bikqi. Those accompanied were also the 70th Division Commander Wang Jingguo, Finance Director Su Tiren, Jin-Sui Opium Suppression Inspection Office Director Li Juyi, and Provincial Government Secretary Gao Boyu. Zhang Xiusheng, the Superintendent of Saibei Customs. On the 14th, Liu also went to Bailing Temple with his secretary, Ji Shouguang, Gao Boyu, Zhang Jun, etc. to meet with the Panchen Lama, and then went to Maoming'an Banner, Daarhan Banner, and Siziwang Banner. After returning to the provincial city for a day of rest, he went to the five eastern counties to investigate. The details of his meeting with the Panchen Lama are recorded below:</p>
<p>Meeting with the Panchen Lama Bailing Temple is 450 li away from Suiyuan Provincial City. It was originally called Beile Wang Temple. Bailing is a corruption of Beile. Liu and his party took a car from the provincial city on the 14th and arrived at 6:20 PM, where they were received by Ding Wangduoji, the section chief of the Panchen Lama's office. Ding was a Tibetan. He sent a swift rider to report to the Panchen Lama. The Panchen Lama had originally planned to go to Zhonggong Banner to chant sutras early on the 15th and had already traveled dozens of li when the swift rider arrived and returned. Liu and his party arrived at White Stone Temple at 10:00 AM on the 15th. Wang Luojie, the Secretary-General of the Panchen Lama, and the Maoming'an Wang Banner Military Commissioner greeted them from afar, each presenting a [hada] (a long blue silk cloth of about two feet, the most respectful gift in Mongolia). At 11:00 AM, they met with the Panchen Lama, with Ding as the translator. Liu first said, "I have admired the great master for a long time, but I have had no chance to meet. I am very disappointed. The first time, the great master was in Beiping. I was eager to meet him, but the great master had already left first. The second time, the great master was visiting Wutai. I lived in Taiyuan and wanted to see him again, but because of matters involved, it was not possible. The third time, the great master was leaving Nanjing, and I arrived at the same time. We missed each other again. My desire to meet the great master is like Xuanzang of the Tang Dynasty seeking scriptures in India, going through many twists and turns (finally reaching the goal. Xuanzang was a Henan person, and his journey started from Chang'an. I am a Chang'an person, and my journey started from Luoyang. They are complementary to each other, which can be laughed at). The Panchen Lama was overjoyed to hear this, and then said, "I have long admired your Excellency's great name. I regret that we have missed many opportunities to meet. But Buddhism talks about karma. My meeting with your Excellency is probably destined and cannot be forced in the slightest. For example, if the fate of meeting each other is on March 3, but you want to meet on February 3 or April 3, it is impossible. Today, we meet in one hall, like brothers and sisters. How happy!" Liu continued, "At present, the Northeast has fallen, and Rehe is in emergency. National border defense is extremely important. Inner Mongolia is a northern screen, and its importance is self-evident. I hope that the great master will promote education in the various leagues and banners with a compassionate heart to save the world, increase the knowledge of the Mongolians, and prevent them from being bullied by strong neighbors." The Panchen Lama said, "I also know about this point. Please give me time, and I will promote it. When I visited the Eastern Provinces, I talked to the Eastern Province officials about how local officials often do not understand the Mongolian situation and abuse the Mongolians, so they harbor resentment. The central government gives preferential treatment to the Mongolians. I know this very well. This time, I will go to the Donggong, Zhonggong, and Xigong banners to chant sutras and, in addition to preaching Buddhism, I will declare the central government's intention to the public." After speaking, he personally unwrapped his watch and presented a fine horse, saying that the place was not peaceful, and he left it as a souvenir for those who came from afar. Then, they took a group photo and left.</p>
<p>Meeting with the Bailing King The Bailing Wang Mansion is also the Daarhan Wang Mansion, 90 li away from Bailing Temple. The Mongolian king of the banner also serves as the chief of the Ulanqab League. Recently, he let his younger brother manage the banner affairs. His younger brother is 53 years old, and the chief of the league is 58 years old. He spends all day chanting Buddha with his palms together. When Liu met with the Bailing King, after a brief greeting, the king first asked, "Is the mainland peaceful?" Liu told him that it was peaceful, and the king was very happy. Then he asked how the situation in Rehe was recently. Liu said, "Rehe is very dangerous. In recent years, the country has been plagued by many misfortunes and frequent foreign troubles. Inner Mongolia is an important border defense area of China. Once something happens, it will bear the brunt. I hope you will strive to be strong and continue the great cause of your ancestors. Don't just chant Buddha all day and be content with the status quo." The king said, "We have also been planning to consolidate border defenses for a long time, but we have repeatedly asked the government for guns and ammunition, but there has been no response. (According to people from the provincial government, the provincial government has given ammunition several times.) Even fools know that it is impossible to resist the enemy with bare hands. I sincerely ask the commissioner to say a word to the government to give us material assistance. Otherwise, if Inner Mongolia is in danger, I am afraid that the mainland will not be able to maintain itself for long." Liu also said, "The government has made up its mind to assist the Mongolian banners. If you do not work hard to revitalize yourselves, promote education, and cultivate the foundation, even if there is assistance, it will not be of long-term benefit. The central government is very concerned about the Mongolian banners. Many people will come to visit in the future. I am just a pioneer. I am determined to come again. I hope you will also go to the mainland." The king smiled and nodded, saying yes repeatedly. After the conversation, they took a group photo together as a souvenir.</p>
<p>What Was Seen in Maoming'an Banner Wang Luojie, the Secretary-General of the Panchen Lama's Office, introduced the younger brother of the Zhasake Military Commissioner of Maoming'an Banner (that is, the younger brother of the king of Zhonggong Banner) and more than ten people, including the military commissioner and Zuo Ling, to meet with Liu. They all wore red tassels and held the etiquette respectfully. In addition to the Panchen Lama's Office preparing the lunch on that day, the banner specially prepared a whole sheep to entertain the guests. When eating, a small piece was cut off with a knife and offered as a tribute. Then the honored guest ate the sheep's back, and the rest was cut and eaten by the guests at will. This is the most respectful etiquette of the Mongolians. The Living Buddha of Huangshitou Temple, 78 years old, was dignified. Liu and the Living Buddha and the Zhasake Vice League Chief and others took a group photo each, and then took a car back to Bailing Temple. The Panchen Lama also set off at the same time to Zhonggong Banner.</p>
<p>Meeting with Siziwang The Siziwang Mansion is 450 li away from the Bailing Wang Mansion. Sha Beizi traveled with him from Bailing Temple and stopped by his home to rest. He entertained the guests with milk tea, fried rice, milk cakes, etc. Along the way, only three or four yurts were seen. Surauli Temple, Tonghui Temple, Heto Temple, and Guangfu Temple are magnificent, embellishing the hundreds of miles of plain. When he arrived, it was already dark. The hosts were Military Commissioners, etc. Although the king had been ill for a hundred days and could not get up, when he heard that Liu had arrived, he sent someone to greet him and said that the king was currently ill and asked if the commissioner would like to see the king. Liu said that he had come specifically to visit the king's illness and then asked to see him. The king was lying naked on the bed, with only a single quilt covering his lower body, in a very sad state, saying that he would not be able to get up, but he was worried that his children were young and no one would take care of them. Liu comforted him kindly and promised to return to the provincial capital and ask the provincial government to hire a doctor on his behalf, and said, "Your position is important. You should take good care of yourself." The king was very moved when he heard this and nodded his head repeatedly. When Liu came out, there was a Military Commissioner who had assisted the king for three generations, 68 years old, energetic like a young man. Liu told him that the border defense was in emergency, and the Mongolians and the government were one and should cooperate to resist aggression. The Military Commissioner said, "Now that the five ethnic groups are united, the Mongolians seem to be an exception. What can we do to resist with empty fists?" While speaking, he pointed to the sky and said, "We can only resign ourselves to fate." Liu put his hands in a heart-shaped gesture and replied, "To resist foreign aggression, the first thing is to be united in mind and heart, and the material is secondary." The Military Commissioner nodded when he heard this and said yes repeatedly, and said that the Mongolians are strong, good at riding, and familiar with the terrain. In the event of an emergency, they will resist desperately and will never surrender under the city.</p>
<p>What Was Seen in Wulan Hua Wulan Hua is a large town in Wuchuan County, only 40 li away from the Siziwang Mansion. Before the traffic with Kulun was cut off, business was very prosperous. It is an important road connecting the mainland with Inner Mongolia. There are two former primary schools, one chamber of commerce, one district party headquarters, three or four collection agencies, and a garrison battalion commander Huang Shijun, who is very capable. He has concrete plans for repairing roads and running schools. Liu and Ji Shouguang of the Provincial Party Committee wanted to run a school in this town to recruit Mongolian children and cultivate real talents to develop the Northwest. It is currently under discussion.</p>
<p>Plans to Return to the Provincial City After Liu returned to the province, he immediately invited Construction Director Feng Xi, Civil Affairs Director Yuan Qingzeng, Provincial Government Secretary-General Zeng Houzai, Provincial Party Committee Ji Shouguang, Zhao Yunyi, and others to present their feelings about this trip to Mongolia and the guidelines for organizing the Mongolian banners and ask the provincial authorities to gradually realize them. The things to be done quickly at present are to run schools, unite the Mongolian banners, and organize Mongolian publications in the short term, and send a doctor to Siziwang Banner to treat the King of Siziwang. The trip cost 40 hours and passed through 2,000 li of grassland. At this time of emergency in border defense, Liu's trip has an impact on the communication between the mainland and the border, which is held up to inform the authorities responsible for organizing the Mongolian banners and those who are concerned about Mongolian affairs.</p>
<p>(Note) The official system of the Mongolian banners, each banner has a king. For the convenience of writing, the old name is also followed. (August 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Engineers' Association Holds Annual Meeting in Tianjin <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Famous Speakers All Hope to Save the Nation Through Science</p>
<p>Proposal to Join the Anti-Civil War Alliance Passed</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The second annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers was held at Nankai University on the morning of the 22nd of this month at 10:00 AM, with discussions in the afternoon regarding association affairs. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The meeting hall was set up in Nanda’s Xiushan Hall. 127 members registered (82 from this city and 45 from other places). 120 people attended that day, with over 20 guests and journalists from various fields. Before the meeting, the giant bell of Nanda was rung twenty-one times, stopped for one minute, and then rung twice again to signify the 21st year of the Republic of China and the second general assembly. This bell was cast by the German Krupp factory when Li Hongzhang of the Qing Dynasty was the Minister of Beiyang, weighing 13,000 catties. It was initially placed in Haiguang Temple. After the Boxer Rebellion, the British moved it to a garden in the British concession until Zhang Boling negotiated for its return in the 19th year of the Republic of China. A bell tower was built on the Nanda campus to house it. The sound of the bell is grand and can be heard for dozens of miles, comparable to the bell of the Grand Bell Temple in the old capital. After the bell stopped, the meeting was opened with a ring, and rituals were performed. Hua Nan-gui, the temporary chairman, delivered an opening speech, stating that the association was formed last year by the merger of the Chinese Engineering Society and the Engineering Society of China. Before the merger, both associations had a history of 20 years. This is the second annual meeting after the merger. The association has over 2,000 registered members. Due to the current situation, very few people attended. The first meeting in Xi’an was changed to Tianjin due to inconvenient transportation. President Cao Yi-fu, who serves in the Ministry of Transportation, was unable to take leave to come to Tianjin due to the national crisis and asked me to represent him by telegram. Today, we are happy to gather here, and I hope that the attending members will express their great views and discuss them together. Engineers are laborers who are not afraid of hardship or difficulties. However, they should also connect and cooperate with all sectors to achieve twice the result with half the effort, thereby eliminating the accumulated habit of engineers not caring about national affairs. Finally, he said that engineers should have the construction courage of a tiger and the service spirit of a sheep, so that they can benefit the country. Next, Ji Shengfu Construction Department Chief Lin Chengxiu (representing Provincial Chairman Wang Shuchang) delivered a speech, stating that the country is now facing many difficulties and urgent foreign insults. The call for unity against aggression is very high, but the reality of unity against aggression is very difficult. Today, the unity of members of the Engineers' Association promotes construction. The annual meeting gathers to exchange knowledge. The responsibility of building a new China in the future will surely be the unanimous effort of your association, and the achievements in the future will be limitless. Next, Zhang Rui, Section Chief of the Municipal Government (representing Mayor Zhou Longguang), delivered a speech, stating that all countries regard the venue for scientific conferences as the highest honor. Today, the Chinese Engineering Society is holding a meeting in Tianjin, which is a great honor for the Tianjin Municipal Government. I still remember seven or eight years ago when Dr. Dewey came to China to give a lecture, among which a motto said, "China's affairs are too complicated, and it is difficult to make China rich and strong without a thousand good people." I feel that now that strong neighbors are oppressing and the foundation of the country is shaking, it is no longer possible for good people who talk about morality and benevolence to save China. At least five hundred of the thousand good people must be engineers to respond to the environment and create a new life. All of you members are either engineering experts or engineering celebrities. I hope that you will serve the society with a spirit of perseverance and build a new China. Once again, Zhang Boling, President of Nanda University, delivered a speech, first expressing his welcome as the host. Then he stated that since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese people have been very uncomfortable, but it is actually an excellent opportunity to save the country, which can give a serious lesson to those who are drunk and dreaming. China's problem lies in talking empty talk and not doing practical things. During the Yuan Shikai era, training troops and developing schools were regarded as two major policies to strengthen the country, but now they have become two major diseases of the country. Japan's strength comes from science, so people with ideas should not speak out when they are bullied, but should work hard to prepare for resistance, otherwise they will undoubtedly die. China is sick because of poverty and weakness. The wealth and strength of Europe and the United States come from science. They can use it, but why can't we? Your spirits and brains are no weaker than those of Westerners, and even the Japanese are not as good as us. Why is our country still poor and weak? The reason is that politics is not on track. Not only can national affairs not be handled, but private businesses are also often hindered. When you were studying in Europe and the United States, your aspirations and ambitions were met with obstacles everywhere after returning to China, causing heroes to have no place to use their talents. I have vowed to run education as a lifelong career for decades, and I don't care about national affairs. In recent years, I have begun to feel that the political is bad, and all citizens cannot but care about it. The annual meeting of the Engineers' Association is of great significance. Unity and cooperation can generate great power. However, you must not remain silent on national affairs, and change your previous attitude of not minding your own business, so that politics can be on track and everything can be easily started. Therefore, I deeply hope that you can have practical and concrete expressions, cheer up, and find a new life for our country. If the spirit is bankrupt, the country will surely perish. Your responsibilities are extremely important, and the hope of the country lies in this. Once again, Fan Xudong, the founder of Yongli Chemical Company, gave a speech entitled "Ancient Engineering Creation and Modern Engineering Performance," talking about the Stone Age to the Scientific Age, in thousands of words. It was the most colorful and moving speech on that day. Next, Bian Baimei, the representative of the Bankers' Association, delivered a speech, saying that the situation is unstable, foreign insults are pressing, and aggression is becoming increasingly urgent. Not only are there military occupations, but all industrial and commercial undertakings are being invaded. Since the September 18th Incident, traffic and shipping routes have been repeatedly obstructed. All of these are within the scope of engineers' work. We should strive to study new constructions and create new life, even if we sacrifice everything, to develop a major expansion and provide assistance in military and political aspects, which can achieve final victory. Furthermore, the Haihe River problem is of great importance to the industry, commerce, and agriculture of North China. I hope to point out the mistakes from a fair and scientific perspective and correct them. If funds are needed, the financial community will naturally help. Tianjin's industry is not developed. Regarding the establishment of factory organizations, I hope to publish fair opinions and guidance so that the financial community can know the truth and jointly develop it. Next, Wang Wendian, the representative of the Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech, stating that to know the prosperity or decline of industry and commerce in a certain place, you can look at the number of chimneys in that place and the comparison of import and export goods at the customs. The increase in chimneys in major commercial ports in our country is very slow, and the customs revenue far exceeds exports. Our country's poverty is due to poor politics, but the decline of social customs and habits is also a major reason. If there is no way to deal with the two things I said, even if there are 20,000 engineers, it will be useless. Therefore, everyone should stand up and work together to save the country. Finally, Zhang Hanying, the representative of the Jinan branch of the Engineering Society, delivered a congratulatory speech, and Hua Nankui delivered a thank-you speech. Then, a group photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. The Tianjin branch of the Engineering Society hosted a banquet at the Nanda Canteen to welcome everyone.</p>
<p>From 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the first business meeting was held, chaired by Mao Yisheng. First, Zhang Xiaoji, the representative of the General Assembly, reported on the association's work in the 20th year and the association's regular income and expenditure in the same year. Then, Zhang Hanying reported on the work of the Jinan branch. Hua Nankui reported on the receipt of the files of the Beiping Chinese Engineers Association Housing Case. Next, more than ten proposals on the association's affairs were passed, and a case to join the Great Alliance to Abolish Internal Wars was passed. By the time the meeting adjourned, the sun had set in the west. Zhang Boling prepared tea and snacks on the roof of the Nanda Mu Zhai Library to entertain everyone. The wives of the school's faculty members all served as hosts. At 7:00 PM, they took cars to the Yong'an Hotel to attend a banquet hosted by the provincial government. The heads of the provincial civil affairs, finance, education, and construction departments all attended to receive them. Wang Yuke, the head of the Civil Affairs Department, delivered a welcome speech, briefly stating that China now needs construction, and engineers have risen to the first position in society. The Soviet Union's five-year plan is an engineering plan, so Chinese engineers should seize the opportunity to work hard. Two thousand members is not a small number, but it cannot be said to be many when measured against the national population. I hope that the Engineering Society will be the foundation for building a prosperous and strong Republic of China. In this way, there is hope for construction. Today, I would like to offer a glass of water and wine to congratulate all members on their success, the progress of the Chinese Engineers Association, and the bright future of the Republic of China. Hua Shanggui then delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the group. At 8:30 PM, the guests and hosts all enjoyed themselves and dispersed. (Evening of August 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Mathematics and Physics Society Holds Annual Meeting in Beiping <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Six Papers Read</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Chinese Society of Mathematics and Physics held its third annual meeting in Beiping City starting on the 22nd, and held public lectures. Meetings continued on the 23rd and 24th. Details are as follows: At 9:00 AM on the 22nd, a public lecture was held in the Second College of Peking University.

<h3 id="e93">Zhenjiang Abolishes the Erqi Bao Silver Standard <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Decision to Implement from the End of This Year</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce submitted a request to abolish taels and change to yuan, the Department of Industry has published a proposal to abolish taels and change to yuan. The Zhenjiang County Party and government organs believe that the Zhenjiang Erqi Bao silver standard hinders commercial development and that it is necessary to abolish it first. After discussion and decision by the Party and government talks, the silver industry and experts were invited to organize a discussion on the abolition of the Erqi Bao. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the discussion held its first meeting in the Chamber of Commerce Building. The attendees were Hu Jianchun, Li Songshan, Cai Yunsu, Hu Jingxuan, Qian Pengxian, Yan Junfu, Lu Xiaobo, Zhang Peng, Wu Tixian, Yu Xiaochuan, Yao Qisu, Wang Zhao Jia, Zhang Yisun, Yang Fangzhen, Yu Yinxuan, (Zhu Qingquan's representative). Zhang Peng was the chairman. The meeting opened as usual. First, the chairman and Yao Qisu, the county committee member, reported on the significance of organizing the discussion. Then, Li Songshan, Lu Xiaobo, Yang Fangzhen, Wu Tixian, Hu Jianchun, Hu Jingxuan, Yan Junfu, etc., expressed their opinions, which can be summarized into two types: One is that although abolishing the Erqi Bao silver standard is a must, there should be a meticulous plan before it is abolished, otherwise it will affect the development of industry and commerce and the social economy. It may fall into the same fate as the bankruptcy of Hankou and Changsha. We must take precautions. Shanghai is the financial hub of the country. Now that Shanghai is proceeding with abolishing taels and changing to yuan, Zhenjiang may as well use Shanghai as the basis. One is that after Zhenjiang abolishes the Erqi Bao, industry and commerce can avoid suffering losses from foreign currency besides profit and loss. The Erqi Bao no longer has spot goods and is a kind of fictitious silver standard. After the abolition, there will be no difficulties. The economic chaos in Hankou, Changsha, and other places in the past was not caused by the abolition of taels and changing to yuan, but for other reasons. Finally, it was decided that (1) Zhenjiang's Erqi Bao silver standard will be abolished after the end of this year's business community. (2) The discount standard will be negotiated and determined by the Chamber of Commerce to convene the money industry and all industries. (3) Contribute opinions to the national abolition of taels and change to yuan. (25th)</p>

<p>All Circles Cheerfully See Off Cao Tuanzhi. Cao Pang, the head of the Songjiang Second Security Regiment, held a medal awarding ceremony yesterday. That night, the activity movie of the giant bandit Taibao Ashu Pig Du Aimei's execution was screened at the People's Education Center. Many people watched it. Today (the 25th) at about 10:00 AM, Commander Cao led his team to depart. A special train was prepared at the station. Firecrackers were set off along the way, reaching the sound of Lixu. Representatives from all walks of life sent off nearly 100 people. When the whistle blew, they waved their scarves and took off their hats. Commander Cao bowed to thank them and left. The troops left in Songjiang to guard the camp were the 11th and 12th companies, all soldiers.</p>

<p>Wujiang Asks to Send Troops to Defend. All circles in Wujiang County, because the county is located on the lake and adjacent to Zhejiang, has always been a place where bandits haunted. Since the provincial security team was stationed, the bandit atmosphere has been slightly reduced. Now the provincial security team has been ordered to transfer to other places. No one took over the defense, and the local police force was weak. Therefore, the county chamber of commerce Wang Lianqin and the public security bureau Zhou Feixiong were promoted to Suzhou to visit Shen Baoyi, commander of the Su Song Bandit Suppression, and asked him to send a guerrilla team to Wu to fill the defense. Commander Shen has agreed to transfer troops. It is also reported that the twelfth company of the fourth battalion of the third regiment of the Provincial Security Team, led by the company commander Lian Sheng, opened Su from Zhenjiang, and on the 25th opened to Wujiang to suppress bandits.</p>

<p>The Coastal Dike Is Becoming More and More Critical. Since the 23rd of this month, there have been hurricanes here, and the coastal dike has been eroded by storm surges, making the situation even more critical. The county government urgently telegraphed the Construction Department and the Jiangnan Dike Engineering Committee, requesting that funds be allocated for emergency repairs as soon as possible, and that the work be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Captured Bandits. The Shuangfeng Public Security Branch of the County Captured three bandits, Yan Baozhi, Qian Xingsheng, and Wu Zhongmei, in Hezhuangjing and Hengjingheng two places the night before. They confessed to robbing Wang Zaijia in Maojia Guanyintang and the Zheng family in Zhintang Yanduntou, and the stolen goods were divided and spent. They were prepared to be sent to the county for legal action.</p>

<p>Shen District Chief Allocated Patrol Boats to the County. Wang Ying, the Provincial Security Team of this county, was ordered to transfer to other places. The county government held an emergency meeting yesterday and sent representatives to Suzhou to meet with the Su Song Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the Provincial Water Public Security Third District Office, requesting that patrol boats be sent to defend the lakeside towns. With the approval of District Chief Shen, ten patrol boats were allocated to defend Nanku, and additional patrol ships were sent to patrol various districts and towns.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Request to Postpone the Transfer of the Provincial Security Team. The County Chamber of Commerce, the Asset Office, the District Office, etc., because Wang Zhiren's troops of the Second Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Provincial Security Team were ordered by Commander Cao to transfer troops to Suqian to suppress bandits, and they will be withdrawn from defense immediately, causing panic among the people. Yesterday, they telegraphed Gu Zhuxi, the chairman of the provincial government, saying that the villages and towns on the lake in the county rely on the stationing of the security team to suppress bandits. I recently heard that Battalion Commander Wang will be transferred to other places immediately, and the public is extremely frightened. It is the time for the harvest of dry rice in the lake fields, and guest people and hired workers are gathered. Without this army, lake bandits will surely take the opportunity to be rampant, and the major towns are in jeopardy. I urge you to postpone the withdrawal or ask for another team to be stationed.

<p>The Shocking News of a Father Killing His Son. Fei Houpu, a farmer in Luowan, Cinan Yu four townships, and his wife, Wang, gave birth to two sons. The eldest son works in a silver building in Shanghai. The second son, A Tang, is 17 years old this year and likes gambling. He once stole a pair of silver rings from his home and pawned them to pay off gambling debts. His father hated him extremely. Later, he grazed cattle at Dongzhuang Bridge. Because of gambling, he was dismissed and returned home. Houpu thought he was so unfilial, so in the afternoon of the day before yesterday, he tied A Tang's hands and feet with a huge rope, opened A Tang's mouth with a bamboo bow, put him in a burlap bag, and threw him into the Luowan River. He was salvaged after half an hour and had already died. The neighbors thought Houpu was so cruel that they reported it to the township office. Township Chief Zhang Juqing, according to the circumstances, ordered the township Ding to arrest Houpu and transfer him to the county government for verification.

She is of excellent character and learning. Ms. Liang was betrothed to a certain military officer by her parents when she was two years old. They got married and lived together in February of this year. However, Ms. Liang has been frowning all day since she got married, and she is always depressed, as if she has unspeakable secrets, causing her to suffer from lung disease. On the 8th of this month, she was admitted to the North Gate Renze Hospital for treatment and lived in Room 14 of the female doctor's office. A certain military officer must visit once a day. As soon as his wife saw him, she sobbed and said nothing. On the afternoon of the 19th, she suddenly asked the doctor for an hour's leave, saying that she was going out to visit a friend. She went to the North Gate Ferry to commit suicide by throwing herself into the river. Did Ms. Liang become tired of the world because of her illness, or is there another secret? Outsiders do not know.</p>

<p>A telegram from Nanjing on the 25th states that Luo Jialun received the government's order appointing him as President of National Central University on the 25th. He immediately submitted his resignation and made a statement to reporters, saying, "When the Executive Yuan decided to appoint me as President of National Central University, I told reporters that I would submit my resignation as soon as the order arrived. Now that I have received the order, I am submitting my resignation immediately. My intention to resign is very firm. In recent years, I have been tired of educational administration. After a major resignation in the past, I retreated to Wuhan University as a professor. Later, the central authorities urged me to return to Chang Central Political School because I had participated in the founding of the school and had emotional ties in addition to a sense of duty. I could not bear to refuse. After arriving at the school, I set a goal to make the school like the French political school. The national crisis suddenly broke out, and I encouraged the youth day and night to take on the responsibility of the French political school after the Franco-Prussian War, to reform domestic politics as the basis for wiping out shame and striving for strength. Fortunately, the whole school is working hard and all reforms are underway. I will never abandon it to engage in the ever-increasing storms and the hundreds of things that need to be managed at National Central University. I and the entire political school will share the hardships for nearly a year. Leaving it to go elsewhere would not only be unfair to my colleagues at the political school, but also to the young students. Although the government intends for me to concurrently hold a position at the political school, I believe that responsibility should be dedicated and not concurrent, lest it lead to errors. I am confident that the government will surely heed my wishes. Recent reports of my remarks, stating that the government did not seek my consent beforehand, are absolutely not true. I only said that I repeatedly subtly agreed, but I have never dared to agree to this day. It is also said that I am too ill to bear the burden. I have indeed been ill recently, but it has nothing to do with my resignation from National Central University. Although I am ill, I absolutely do not want to consider myself an invalid. I have always been very straightforward in my work and would never want to use illness as an excuse for shirking responsibility," etc. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Annual Meeting of the Society for Social Education Opens in Hangzhou <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Ceremony Was Held in the Morning: A General Meeting Continued in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The first annual meeting of the China Society for Social Education opened yesterday (the 24th) at 9:00 AM at the Zhejiang Provincial Library on Puzhang Lane in Hangzhou. Attendees included Yang Donglin, representative of the Central Party Headquarters; Peng Baichuan, representative of the Ministry of Education; Hu Jianzhong, representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters; Qian Jiazhi, representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education; Zhong Daozan, representative of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education; Xiang Jutan, representative of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education; and members Yu Qingtang, Shu Xincheng, Shang Zhongyi, and more than eighty others. Zheng Zonghai served as chairman, and Zhao Guangtao and Li Bangquan served as recorders. After the formalities were completed, the chairman delivered the opening address, stating that the society was just over a year old, but social education activities had been with people since birth. From childhood to adulthood, people are constantly receiving education, but in the past, Chinese etiquette and education mostly focused on subtle influence, touching people unconsciously. The times have evolved, and intangible social education has evolved into tangible education that supplements knowledge and enhances skills. Social education establishes various activity organizations, such as public education centers and libraries, which are tangible and concrete manifestations. The target of social education, in a broad sense, is all our Chinese compatriots, including farmers, workers, merchants, students, soldiers, men, women, old, and young, all of whom are receiving education. Since the quality is so complex and the quantity is so large, it is not easy to achieve the greatest effect in a very short time, with very little money, and with very few people. Furthermore, in terms of the current national situation, the century-long plan for cultivating talents is indeed important, but it is not enough to meet the urgent needs, and there is also the fear of the nest overturning and the eggs being broken. Therefore, today, in order to seek emergency relief, it is necessary to carry out horizontal and universal propaganda among the people, and it is also necessary to start with popular education. The members of this society feel that social education is an urgent and needed cause, and they also feel the importance of this mission. For all facilities, theories, and practices of social education, there is a need for collective consultation and discussion. Therefore, this society was initiated, and today's annual meeting is being held. The content of this meeting can be divided into four categories: (1) social education and education system issues, (2) rural improvement issues, (3) improving research interest and methods, and (4) exchange of popular reading materials and other publications. In addition, each service organization reports on its work for mutual reference, and the most important topic is still the effectiveness, estimation, and statistical methods of adult education, in order to determine the final education</p>
<p>standards. This is also the central issue of this annual meeting. After the chairman's speech, Yu Qingtang, director of the board of directors' office, reported on the general situation of the office's work. Then, Yang Donglin, representative of the Central Party Headquarters, and Peng Baichuan, representative of the Ministry of Education, delivered training speeches. Hu Jianzhong, representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters, and Qian Jiazhi, Zhong Daozan, and Xiang Jutan, representatives of the education departments of various provinces, delivered speeches successively. Then, members Ma Zongrong and Dong Huaihuangzhong delivered speeches in succession. The general meeting was held at 2:00 PM, chaired by Gao Yang, chairman of the presidium, to discuss all the proposals. Because the total number of proposals exceeded seventy, special review committee members were elected. As a result, Yu Qingtang, Gan Yuyuan, Zhao Mian, Shu Xincheng, Ma Zongrong Gao Yang, Zheng Zonghai, Xiang Jutan, Peng Baichuan, Dong Huai, Shang Zhongyi, and Zhong Daozan were selected as review committee members. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM, followed by a review meeting, which was divided into four categories: special, administrative, facilities, and social affairs, which were submitted for review. It was not completed until 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Revised Standards for Primary School Curriculum <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The decisions of the Curriculum Standards Revision Committee for Primary and Secondary Schools regarding the curriculum for junior high schools and senior high schools have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. (As a temporary motion, there is also the issue of whether junior high schools and senior high schools should have co-education or whether boys and girls should be taught in separate classes. Because the case is important and cannot be decided in a short time, it will be decided by the Ministry of Education. Also, the case of whether junior high school teachers' salaries should stop being based on the hourly system will be sent to the Ministry of Education for reference because the Ministry of Education will soon stipulate measures for teachers' salaries.) The resolution on the primary school curriculum has also been slightly revised after being sorted out by the responsible department of the Ministry of Education. The following is a summary of the various resolutions, compiled as follows: (Those comprehensive resolutions that have not yet been determined or have only been initially determined and cannot be officially announced are recorded in a slightly simplified manner.)</p>
<p>(Zi) During the meeting, the attending committee members were divided into several groups to revise the content and writing style of the original primary school curriculum standards, and to separately designate revision committee members for each subject, including health, music, Chinese, kindergarten, arithmetic, social studies, nature, physical education, art, and manual labor.</p>
<p>(Chou) After the formal promulgation of the curriculum standards, the Ministry of Education is requested to devise ways to create standards for testing various subjects in primary schools as the basis for concrete graduation standards for various subjects in primary schools.</p>
<p>(Yin) In the general outline of the primary school curriculum standards, except for the first item [General Objectives of Primary School Education], which was largely revised during the first day of the meeting (as reported in the previous newspaper) and was reviewed again during the fifth meeting, the original draft was used without revision. The full text of the original draft is as follows: [First] General Objectives of Primary School Education] Primary schools should, in accordance with the party's program, follow the educational purpose of the Republic of China and its implementation policies, implement child-centered education to develop children's physical and mental health, cultivate the foundation of national morality, and the basic knowledge and skills necessary for life. The analysis is as follows: 1. To train children's healthy physique; 2. To cultivate children's good character; 3. To develop children's life skills; 4. To train children's labor skills; 5. To cultivate children's scientific attitude; 6. To increase children's artistic interests.) The rest will be sorted out by the standing committee.</p>
<p>(Mao) Revise the outline of the curriculum standards. (The content is not yet convenient to publish) (Chen) A table should be established in the general outline of the implementation methods of this standard to indicate the books used for each subject (to be determined by the standing committee).</p>
<p>(Ji) The positions of the general principles of teaching and the implementation methods in the general outline should be reversed. (Wu) No party ideology course is set up. All civic knowledge is incorporated into the social studies teaching, and civic training is added, with sixty minutes per week.) Therefore, the social studies score for senior grades is increased, with one hundred and eighty minutes per week, nature one hundred and fifty minutes, and art increased by thirty minutes to a total of ninety minutes. There are no significant changes in other subjects.</p>
<p>(Wei) Resolutions on various issues related to civic training:</p>
<p>(1) When increasing the standards for civic training and recommending members to draft and compile, attention should be paid to:</p>
<p>1. The purpose of civic training is to train character and behavior. 2. Two sessions should be scheduled on the overall timetable each week as guidance time (etiquette, practices, and behavioral practice). 3. Use group activities as opportunities for civic training. 4. In addition to the class teacher or instructor being responsible for special training, all other teachers in the school must be responsible for training. 5. The main points of the training method should explain that textbooks are not allowed and only teaching methods for teachers can be compiled. 6. Civic training should guide children with concrete standards, using pictures, music, stories, etc., and implement it practically.</p>
<p>(2) Compile an outline of the civic training curriculum: 1. Objectives, 2. Concrete standards (concrete standards are compiled by year and summarized into several programs), 3. Key points of the training method.</p>
<p>The final meeting reviewed the operational points of civic training and determined four major categories: 1. Regarding morality, 2. Regarding recreation, 3. Regarding politics, 4. Regarding economics.</p>
<p>(3) Determine the objectives of civic training: 1. To cultivate children's noble character and good behavior; 2. To cultivate children's strong physique and happy emotions; 3. To cultivate children's ability to organize groups and the spirit of social service; 4. To develop children's labor habits and interest in production.</p>
<p>(4) This group's meeting will formulate the main points of the civic training method and hand them over to the standing committee to determine the training method (main points attached).</p>
<p>(5) The standing committee will sort out and classify the detailed items of civic training based on existing materials, establish a table by year, and send it to the members of this group for a limited time to report their opinions before making a decision (the content of the table should include at least: 1. Articles, 2. Whether or not it is necessary, 3. Category, 4. Grade system).</p>
<p>(Shen) The curriculum standards for health, art, music, kindergarten, and other subjects were passed in accordance with the review plan amendment. The standards for Chinese, nature, manual labor, physical education, arithmetic, and other subjects were passed in accordance with the revision opinions.</p>
<p>(You) The middle school group suggested that attention be paid to the connection between the curriculum of primary and secondary schools and the functions of primary and junior high schools. The resolution was to formulate opinions and send members to the middle school group for explanation. Suggested content (Chinese language): 1. In principle, junior high school students should use vernacular Chinese for written expression. 2. When teaching classical Chinese at the beginning of junior high school, the amount should be reduced as much as possible to maintain the originally set ratio of classical Chinese to vernacular Chinese (arithmetic): The level of arithmetic in primary schools has been lowered. It is hoped that the level of arithmetic in junior high schools will be lowered by one year compared with the past in order to connect (general opinion) (1) During primary school education (in accordance with the stipulated school system), children cannot decide on their future careers. This responsibility should be borne by junior high schools. It is hoped that in the future, the junior high school curriculum should still have the function of exploring children's vocational interests and should not be limited to entering higher education (2) The Ministry of Education has previously issued an order that all subjects in junior high school, except for Chinese language, which can be used in classical Chinese, should generally be used in vernacular Chinese. Please pay attention to this.</p>

<p>The colleagues of the China Vocational Education Society believe that the atmosphere of the northeastern bandits is becoming increasingly urgent, and all the righteous armies rely on hand-to-hand combat to fight hard, still delaying a ray of hope. Although all circles in this city and overseas Chinese have given material assistance, temporary fundraising cannot help in long-term resistance. Therefore, at the 455th staff meeting of the society the other day, it was decided that from this month onwards, all staff and members of the society would donate 2% of their monthly salaries until the day the righteous army succeeds in resisting Japan. In addition, all affiliated organizations were notified to refer to and imitate it. Although this move by the society is not large in number, its intention is far-reaching. If all agencies can imitate it, then although it is a drop in the bucket, the righteous army should have a relatively permanent source of funds. It is thought that patriotic gentlemen at home and abroad will be able to rise up in response to the news.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhijiang recently sent a letter to Shanghai Binqi Jianxin Zunsan Boying, saying, "Dear comrades, I am very pleased with the electric telegram from you and other comrades to the National Sports Conference. Your earnest expectations for the conference and your strong statements on the importance of swimming are deeply comforting. The conference is now making proper resolutions on various sports programs, and swimming is certainly an important part of it. What is gratifying is that the Central Guoshu Institute has already listed swimming as a compulsory course, which coincides with the wishes of you and other comrades. When improving and promoting, I hope to show you what I have seen. And I greatly admire the enthusiasm of you for sports. I would like to tell you that you should strive for perfection in swimming, but also pay special attention to Guoshu, the unique national essence of our country. It can not only strengthen the body and the species, but also defend against insults. The magical effect and macro effect of its application have been clearly demonstrated in the Battle of Shanghai. If it is promoted and advocated, it will be of great benefit to the future of driving out the bandits and killing the enemy. I am now sending a few copies of my superficial remarks on Guoshu sports. Please check and refer to them."</p>

<h3 id="e128">Cai Tingkai Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Accompanied by Aide-de-Camp Tang Dehuang</p>
<p>Staying at Song's Residence, Heading to the Capital Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>Cai Denies Chen Mingshu's Taking Over Fujian</p>
<p>General Cai Tingkai, Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army and Acting Pacification Commissioner of Fujian Province, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 AM on the Dutch ship "Chisalia" from Xiamen. He immediately visited Song Ziwen, Chen Mingshu, Dai Ji, and others, and plans to go to the capital within the next few days to report to the central government on the recent situation of bandit suppression. The following is a detailed account of Cai's arrival in Shanghai and his remarks:</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai: Cai Tingkai, accompanied by Tang Dehuang, Director of the Aide-de-Camp Office, and Aide-de-Camp Ye Lixin, arrived in Shanghai on the Dutch ship "Chisalia" from Xiamen on the 22nd of this month. The ship encountered a storm en route, delaying its arrival at Wusong Estuary until 5:00 AM yesterday. It reached the Yitaixing Wharf in Pudong at 6:30 AM. Due to the strong wind and rapid currents, the ship had difficulty turning around, which took a long time. Therefore, Cai did not wait for the ship to dock and instead boarded the Hai Guan Jinghui patrol boat that came to meet him. He landed at the New Customs Wharf at 7:40 AM.</p>
<p>Welcoming Party: Those who boarded the Dutch ship on the Jinghui patrol boat yesterday morning to welcome Cai included Fan Qiwu, former Director of the Rear Affairs Office of the 19th Route Army (the rumor that Fan came with Cai is incorrect, as Fan has been in Shanghai all along, residing at the Cangzhou Hotel), Wang Zhiyuan, Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, Lin Jin, representative of Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji, Tang Haian, representative of Song Ziwen, Lu Wenlan, Salt Transport Commissioner of Songjiang, and more than a dozen of Cai's relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Visiting Song and Meeting Chen: After landing, Cai, accompanied by Fan Qiwu, Tang Haian, and others, took a car to Song's residence on Qiqi Road to visit Song Ziwen. They talked until 9:40 AM. Cai then went to Shanzhong Road with Fan Qiwu to meet with Chen Mingshu, talking for an hour. At 11:00 AM, he returned to Song's residence, where Song Ziwen hosted a welcome banquet. At 4:30 PM, Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji went to Song's residence to meet with Cai. Around 6:00 PM, they went out together. Cai stayed overnight at Song's residence. Tang Dehuang and others who came with him were taken to the Longhua Headquarters by Lin Jin, Director of the Aide-de-Camp Office of the Garrison Command, to meet with Commander Dai and report on everything.</p>
<p>Heading to the Capital Soon: According to reliable sources, in addition to reporting on the military affairs of bandit suppression to the central government and discussing financial issues, Cai's visit also involves important matters to be negotiated with Chen Mingshu. Cai will be going to the capital today or tomorrow, possibly traveling by Sikorsky plane with Song Ziwen. As for the date of his return to Fujian, it is expected to be in about two weeks.</p>
<p>Cai's Remarks: Cai met with reporters from various newspapers at Song's residence yesterday morning, saying, "The purpose of my trip north is to report on the bandit suppression work to the central government, so my stay in Shanghai will be very short. Because I have been apart from Minister Song and Minister Chen for many days, I went to visit them immediately after getting off the ship for a brief chat. My visit to Song was not to discuss financial issues in Fujian. Chairman Fang Taosheng is responsible for the finances of Fujian Province, and I am only offering my assistance in terms of friendship. Recently, there have been rumors that the Fujian provincial government is about to be reorganized and that Chen Mingshu will go to Fujian to take charge. These are all rumors. As for the bandit situation in Fujian, since our army launched the suppression campaign, the main force of the bandits has retreated to the Longyan area in western Fujian. The front line of the bandit suppression army is about thirty miles away from Longyan, consisting of the 61st Division and a part of the 78th Division. However, there are still scattered bandits roaming around, but they can be quickly wiped out once pursued. Tan Qixiu's supplementary brigade has now arrived and is stationed in Fuzhou. The bandit suppression work is still actively underway. The reports that the Guangdong army suddenly withdrew from southern Fujian are completely untrue. Opium seedlings are everywhere in Fujian Province, and the opium ban has been relaxed. After our army arrived in the province, we immediately ordered the ban on opium. Anyone who smokes or grows opium will be severely punished once arrested, so opium cultivation is about to disappear, but very few smokers have quit. I deeply hope to eradicate opium in Fujian Province in the shortest possible time." The reporter then asked about his attitude towards the Japanese army's repeated invasion of Rehe and the crisis in the Northeast. Cai was quite indignant upon hearing this, saying that he deeply regrets the fall of the Northeast and that it is even more painful to think about when the lost territory will be recovered. He hopes that everyone, from top to bottom, will be united and determined to resist foreign aggression, so that there will be a day to avenge our humiliation and strengthen our country.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Protect Overseas Merchants <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Urges Careful Selection of Consular Personnel and Strict Performance Evaluation</p>
<p>Recommends Dispatching Warships to Patrol and Protect Compatriots</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that overseas merchants in various places have been subjected to destruction by local governments in recent years, leading to a miserable situation abroad. Yesterday, it sent a special cable to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that overseas consuls be instructed to strive for protection and that warships be dispatched to patrol and protect overseas Chinese. The original cable is recorded as follows: "To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: Overseas Chinese residing abroad are mostly laborers and vendors selling local products needed by overseas Chinese. This is not enough to be considered international commerce. Recently, with the domestic new industries taking shape, these products have been exported to some extent, deeply provoking the jealousy of local industrialists and merchants, who have resorted to all kinds of destructive measures. Recently, the prohibition of the sale of Apollo light bulbs in Batavia, and the prohibition of the import of Yonghe Industrial Company's cosmetics by a certain commercial bank in Burma two years ago, are just a few examples that are chilling. Consuls are originally commercial affairs officials and have the responsibility to protect the merchants of their own country. The above-mentioned places are not without our country's consuls stationed there, but their efforts to mediate have not been effective at all. They are derelict in their duties and cannot escape public criticism. We urge your ministry to be extra cautious in the selection of overseas consular personnel and to raise adequate funds to avoid the frequent lack of funds for consulates. Then, strict performance evaluations should be established, with the promotion and demotion of each consul determined by the effectiveness of their protection, so that overseas commerce can gradually progress. The country would be fortunate. Moreover, even after the destruction of the navy in the late Qing Dynasty, there were still instances of dispatching warships to comfort overseas Chinese, which had a positive impact on international perception and the protection of overseas Chinese. In recent years, since the massacre of overseas Chinese in Korea, this practice has almost disappeared, except for the dispatch of a Zhenhai warship to comfort the victims in the Northeast after the incident. This has made overseas Chinese feel even more abandoned by their motherland. We urge your ministry to submit a proposal to the Executive Yuan, which should be put on the agenda, requiring the Ministry of the Navy to select warships from the First Fleet each year that are capable of sailing overseas for patrols, establishing connections with foreign countries while implicitly protecting overseas Chinese. This seems to be the most important task today. We hope you will consider and handle this matter appropriately. Respectfully, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e130">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Hosted a Banquet for Zheng Bulun Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Large-Scale National Goods Company to be Established in Java</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet for Zheng Bulun, representative of the Java Chamber of Commerce, at the chamber's third floor at 12:00 noon yesterday. Attendees included Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Yu Zuoting, Zhu Wenqi, Lao Jingxiu, Luo Qinghua, Ma Shaoquan, Pan Xusheng, Ye Jiaxing, Yan Esheng, Zheng Dengqing, Chen Shaofu of the Nanjing National Goods Exhibition Hall, Wang Xiaochun, representative of the Shanghai National Goods Exhibition Hall, Chen Yiting of the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, Ji Jiannan of the Machine-Made National Goods Factory Association, Sun Choucheng of the National Goods Factory Association, and Zhu Boyuan of the Commodity Exhibition Center, totaling more than twenty people. Wang Xiaolai delivered a welcome speech, and Zheng Bulun gave a speech of thanks. The full text of the speeches is not recorded. It is said that Zheng's return to China this time carries a significant mission. Many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia want to purchase domestic goods, but the supply cannot meet the demand. The Java Chinese General Chamber of Commerce has initiated a plan to establish a large-scale national goods company in conjunction with a majority of merchants in Southeast Asia. The company plans to purchase large quantities of domestic goods and promote them overseas. Zheng was specially selected to return to China to investigate the status of domestic production in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Hankou, Kaifeng, Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, and other places to serve as a standard for procurement. The association has scheduled Zhu Boyuan to accompany Zheng to visit major national goods factories in Shanghai on the 27th of this month to conduct on-site inspections for research. The letter sent to each factory is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, We have been informed by Mr. Zheng Bulun, the Chief Representative of the Overseas Chinese Industrial Investigation Team dispatched by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Cirebon, Java, that the association has raised five million yuan to establish a large-scale national goods company to purchase large quantities of domestic goods and promote them overseas. He has returned to China to investigate the status of domestic goods production and sales to serve as a standard for future procurement and has requested us to introduce him to visit major factories in Shanghai for research. We have long admired your factory's large scale and excellent products. Therefore, we are writing to introduce him and hope you will provide hospitality and discuss everything. We would be grateful.

<p>The Northeast National Salvation Army Received Three Telegrams Yesterday</p>
<p>The Propaganda Committee of the General Supervisory Department of the Northeast National Salvation Army received a telegram from Shanhaiguan, copied as follows: "Telegram of the 25th: After assuming office, Mantetsu President Lin Botianlang inspected various locations along the railway line. Last night, his train passed through Anshan on its way back south when it was attacked by the volunteer army. He escaped and told people in Liaoning that the instability in Manchuria was unexpected. Another telegram: Liu Jingwen, the pseudo-county magistrate and director of the Public Security Bureau of Xiuyan, who has always strongly supported the propositions and actions of the National Salvation Army, led his troops in a defection on New Year's Day, detaining Japanese officials and ordering the re-raising of the white and blue flag in his jurisdiction. Another telegram: After Zhu Jiqing deleted the telegram and published it, he personally commanded the battle, causing a great shock to the Japanese army in western Liaoning. Japanese newspapers have reprinted it one after another."</p>

<p>The General Headquarters of the Liaodong People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army yesterday continued to receive a report from Guan Xiangyang, commander of the 21st Route Army, stating that Li Dianyi, leader of the Iron Army under his command, led his team to launch a fierce attack on Nanshan Chengzhi at dawn on August 19th. After about two hours of fighting, the enemy saw that the soldiers of the team were not afraid of death. Even though they were hit by bullets, they still rushed forward bravely, falling and rising repeatedly. They abandoned their weapons and fled, shouting "The Iron Army is terrible!" Our army occupied Nanshan Chengzhi for about half a day. Japanese planes then circled in the air, dropping countless bombs. Fearing that the bombs would harm ordinary civilians, we abandoned our weapons and withdrew. In this battle, we captured about twenty rifles and more than a hundred bullets. The Japanese police and retreating troops suffered many casualties. We suffered four wounded and two dead. Please provide urgent assistance so that we can launch a full-scale general attack."</p>

<h3 id="e134">Lu Lu, Captain of the Police Brigade, Left Shanghai Yesterday with Peace Police <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Heading Back to Peace via Jinpu Railway</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the police force in the war zone has been weak. Therefore, Mayor Wu transferred a police brigade from Peiping, led by Captain Lu Lu, to Shanghai to assist the Municipal Public Security Bureau in maintaining security in northern Shanghai. At that time, it coincided with the signing of the ceasefire agreement, and the Japanese troops gradually withdrew. A large number of Peiping police were transferred to Zhenru and Zhabei war zones to serve, which was quite effective. Later, the Shanghai North Office was established, and the municipal government appointed Huang Ming as the director of the Shanghai North Office. Lu, feeling that his talent was not being fully utilized, became passive and repeatedly submitted his resignation to the municipal government, which was repeatedly retained by the municipal government. The Peiping police also did not accept the local customs and had intentions to leave. Now that the local security has been restored to the state before the January 28th Incident, and the local police force in Shanghai is also sufficient to maintain local security, Captain Lu saw that the time was ripe and led six hundred Peiping policemen to Beijing by train yesterday, heading back to the north via Jinpu. There are still about five hundred Peiping policemen remaining in Shanghai, and it is expected that they will also return to the north one after another after Captain Lu Lu returns to Peiping.</p>

<p>Arikawa's Arrival in China: The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Arikawa Akira, will arrive in Shanghai on September 4th. Japanese Consul Murai told reporters from this newspaper yesterday that Arikawa's sole mission after taking office in China is to demand that the Chinese authorities suppress the anti-Japanese goods movement. Consul Murai had previously protested this matter to Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, but the municipal government has not yet responded. Due to Mayor Wu's request, the content of the Japanese consulate's protest and Consul Murai's conversation with Mayor Yi will not be disclosed. The Japanese side also does not want to exacerbate the situation and therefore does not need to promote it. One point discussed by Mayor Wu and Consul Murai last time has been accepted by the Japanese side, but the Japanese side is not yet satisfied with one other point. As for Ambassador Arikawa's visit to China this time, he is not responsible for negotiating the Northeast Incident, as this issue will be decided after the League of Nations meeting.</p>
<p>Okazaki's Return Home: Shijunsha reports that the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai received a telegram from Arikawa, the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, from Tokyo on the 23rd, stating that he will arrive in China on September 2nd with the newly appointed Director of the Shanghai Special Police Department, Misa, by the Nagasaki Maru from Kobe. The Japanese military and political authorities in Shanghai immediately appointed Okazaki, the Japanese member of the Joint Committee (i.e., the Japanese director of the Municipal Council), to leave Shanghai for Japan on the Japanese mail ship Nagasaki Maru at 9:00 AM this morning to welcome Arikawa. However, although Okazaki's return to Japan is ostensibly to welcome Arikawa, he was actually summoned by the Japanese government to report on the progress of the Joint Committee and to strive for the recovery of the road construction beyond the boundaries and the current situation of goods arriving in Shanghai. It is also heard that when Okazaki returns to Jinjiang at the beginning of next month, in addition to Arikawa and Misa, the newly appointed Consul-General to Shanghai, Ishii, will also come to Shanghai together.</p>
<p>Yano's Journey to Beijing: Since the discovery of the Iron-Blooded Assassination Corps, the Japanese Embassy has held important meetings for days, discussing nothing but the issue of resisting Japanese goods. At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, Yano Makoto convened an emergency meeting at the embassy office, attended by Chief of Staff Tashiro, Lu Haijun Kitaoka, and military attachés. The main point of discussion was that although a protest had been filed with the municipal government regarding the actions of the Iron-Blooded Assassination Corps, the city government had not strictly prohibited the boycott of Japanese goods. A unanimous decision was made that Deputy Ambassador Yano would go to Beijing immediately to request the National Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to strictly ban the group and to strictly prohibit the boycott of Japanese goods. Otherwise, the Chinese government would be fully responsible if the city's security was endangered in the future. Yano Makoto has scheduled to travel to the capital this morning on the Beijing-Shanghai Army. However, this trip is nominally a visit to important figures in our government in the capacity of the newly appointed Acting Ambassador to China, but it is actually a protest to our government regarding the issue of resisting Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Harada Returns to Changchun: Harada Shunichi, the former high-ranking adviser sent by the pseudo-Manchukuo government, came to Shanghai via Dalian from Changchun by ship. His mission was indeed ordered by the pseudo-government to discuss important matters with the Japanese military and political authorities in Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, he visited various important figures in the Japanese authorities in Shanghai for days. Now that Harada's mission is complete, he returned to Changchun by ship yesterday.</p>
<p>Takeuchi Returns to Japan: Takeuchi, the Japanese Deputy Consul in Shanghai, was ordered last week to come to Shanghai to investigate the recent anti-Japanese goods movement in Shanghai and to prepare for the expansion of the Japanese Police Department. He completed his mission and returned to Japan the day before yesterday (24th).</p>

<p>Claiming Prior Clearance from the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Acknowledging Understanding from the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Asserting Our Protest is Unfounded</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy Marine Corps previously demonstrated in Jiangwan and Zhabei with dozens of trucks. The Shanghai Municipal Government protested to the Japanese Consul General on the 16th. At that time, the Japanese side promised to investigate. According to Japanese sources, Japanese Consul Murai replied to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that the Japanese troops who went to the war zone for sightseeing had obtained prior clearance from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The Japanese troops who crossed the border had also disarmed, but they were still in military uniforms, which caused misunderstandings among the Chinese police and residents. They believed that the Municipal Government's proposal was unfounded.</p>

<p>Strict Security in Important Areas of Hongkou</p>
<p>Dagongshe reports that since the rise of patriotic groups such as the Iron-Blooded Assassination Corps, various industry groups in Shanghai have been working hard on the anti-Japanese goods movement, which has attracted the attention and hatred of the Japanese. Japanese Consul Murai protested to the Municipal Government last week, and Japanese expatriates in Shanghai have been devising ways to undermine the movement. Yesterday, Sugisaka, Commander of the Japanese Marine Corps, suddenly ordered the formation of a special police force of the Marine Corps to prevent all anti-Japanese movements. Acting Ambassador Yano, under instructions from the Japanese government, is scheduled to go to Beijing this morning (26th) to negotiate with the National Government on the suppression of the anti-Japanese goods movement. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Formation of a Special Police Force: Commander Sugisaka of the Special Marine Corps, based on requests from many Japanese expatriates, believes that the recent anti-Japanese goods movement in Shanghai has been drastic and may affect the safety of Japanese expatriates' lives, property, and businesses. He requested thorough protection and prompt measures to suppress the movement. In addition to the Consul General's request to the Municipal Council to increase police force and jointly prevent the movement with the Japanese Police Department, Commander Sugisaka immediately dispatched 250 soldiers from the Marine Corps to form a special police force to provide protection. The headquarters of the force is located in the Japanese Telegraph Bureau on Tiantong Road, and dozens of armed patrol soldiers have been assigned to patrol various important areas in Hongkou. Military telephone lines have also been installed on various roads to facilitate the transmission of information.</p>
<p>90 Million Yen Worth of Japanese Goods Stored: According to Japanese sources, since the anti-Japanese goods movement began, Japanese goods have been stopped from being shipped out for the past three weeks, which has greatly affected the losses of various Japanese trading houses. As of now, the amount of Japanese goods stored in Shanghai has reached as high as 90 million yen.</p>

<p>Acknowledging Japanese Atrocities</p>
<p>Being Exploited by Unscrupulous Merchants</p>
<p>Yuandongsheng reports that unscrupulous merchants, alarmed by the continuous activities of patriotic groups, have exploited ignorant civilians to form the so-called "Red-Clad Protection Group" and sent letters to various national salvation groups, making grand threats. Li Cishan, Shen Zuru, Chen Peide, Zhang Tianbai, and others, the executive directors of the National Salvation Groups Joint Association, also received these letters. The police, upon hearing the news, dispatched a large number of detectives to protect the office of the National Salvation Groups Joint Association on Guling Road yesterday. The original letter is recorded below: "To Whom It May Concern: Since the January 28th Incident, although Japanese atrocities have occurred, we must think of fundamental solutions and use virtue to influence our 400 million compatriots to resist foreign aggression together in order to succeed. If we use violence and coercion to threaten ordinary merchants, the merchants will suffer wartime losses, be impoverished, and their vitality will not recover. And you want to show off and advocate resisting goods, causing suffering to the merchants and organizing the 'Iron-Blooded Assassination Corps', creating terror in the market. The merchants cannot bear the disturbance, so they organized the 'Red-Clad Protection Group' to defend themselves. If you do not restrain yourselves this time, our group vows to use pistols and bombs to fight against you politicians and party-sellers who want to show off. Don't blame us for not warning you in advance. To Li Cishan, Shen Zuru, Chen Peide, Zhang Tianbai, etc., from the Red-Clad Protection Group."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Sea Vessels Still Suspended Yesterday <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Hurricane Not Abated</p>
<p>The hurricane in Shanghai has lasted for three days, and the Fujian-Zhejiang sea vessels that have been suspended in Shanghai have not been able to leave, resulting in huge losses. The current situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Hurricane Direction: The hurricane moved from Taipei to the Wenzhou Ocean the day before yesterday and turned towards Fuzhou. According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday, the hurricane's trend is still circling over the Wenzhou Ocean. This hurricane is moving very slowly. There are clouds and strong winds and showers in the southern part of the Yangtze River. The hurricane is blowing from Wenzhou towards the west-northwest. There are extremely strong easterly winds and gales in the Yellow Sea, and the climate in the East China Sea is also very bad. There is also sudden rain and gale in the east-southeast.</p>
<p>Three Days of Suspension: The Taikoo's New Beijing and New Ning Shao, which are Shanghai-Ningbo liners, are still docked in Zhenhai yesterday.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>They have not come to Shanghai yet. The Zhaoshang's Sanbei, which is in Shanghai, and the Ningbo ship believed that the two ships were blocked for two days, causing significant business losses. They had planned to depart yesterday, but the hurricane warning was even worse than the day before yesterday, so they were ordered to continue to stop sailing and simply change to departing on Saturday. Eight of the twelve Ningbo ships this week will be suspended due to the wind.</p>
<p>Obstruction of Entry and Exit: The Guangji, Xinfeng, Guangli, and various Shanghai-Taiwan liners that had departed the day before yesterday encountered a hurricane as soon as they sailed out of Wusong. Most of the ships did not dare to take risks and were reportedly anchored outside Wusong to avoid the wind, waiting for it to subside before sailing. The various Nanyang liners coming to Shanghai have mostly not arrived yet. The wind direction yesterday also blocked the North Ocean liners. It is also heard that three ships coming from the East Sea have not arrived yesterday because they were avoiding the wind en route and will be postponed to today for entry.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Entire Issue of Levying Paper Currency Tax is Nearing Resolution <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Minister of Finance Song met with Zou Lin and Chen Xing for discussion</p>
<p>Mei Lehe also met with Song to discuss the blockade of Northeastern Customs</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the issue of the Ministry of Finance levying a tax on the issuance of paper currency, sources within banking circles have stated that a solution has been reached. Minister Song has not yet gone to the capital yesterday, but met with Mei Lehe and others at his residence to discuss the issue of blockading Northeastern Customs. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Paper Currency Tax Can Be Resolved. The issue of the Ministry of Finance levying a tax on the issuance of paper currency has been repeatedly negotiated by representatives of banking circles, including Zhang Gongquan, Li Fusun, and Hu Bijang, with Zhang Shouyong acting as an intermediary. The day before yesterday, Zhang Gongquan and Li Fusun again met with Minister Song to conduct further consultations. The focus of the issue has shifted from delaying the tax to reducing the tax rate. Yesterday, Minister Song successively met with Finance Vice Minister Zou Lin and Central Bank Vice President Chen Xing to discuss the paper currency tax issue. According to banking circles yesterday, a solution has been reached regarding the paper currency issuance tax issue. Currently, the opinions of banks issuing paper currency are being solicited, and the date of a complete resolution is not far off. As for the content of the solution, it has not yet reached the stage of being announced. Regarding the issue of Northeastern Customs, Chief of the General Customs Administration Mei Lehe visited Minister Song at around 10:00 a.m. yesterday to continue discussing the issue of Northeastern Customs. The talks lasted for more than an hour before he departed. It is said that the issue of blockading Northeastern Customs is still in the planning stage, as there are still several difficulties that have not been resolved, so the date of implementation of the blockade is still pending.</p>
<p>Zhu Urges Song to Go to the Capital Soon. News reports stated that Minister Song was scheduled to fly to the capital yesterday morning, but this did not happen. It is rumored that Song will fly to the capital this morning with Cai Tingkai, but according to those close to Song, Minister Song had no preparations to go to the capital as of last night. It seems unlikely that he will leave Shanghai within the next day or two. Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua visited Song yesterday morning to urge him to return to the capital as soon as possible to handle the affairs of the Yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Mayor Wu Discusses Ways to Remedy the City's Finances <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>It is decided to implement a business tax and increase the land tax</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the city government's budget for this year is short by three million yuan. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun convened a meeting with the heads of the Finance Bureau and other three bureaus, as well as Xu Shengchan, manager of the city bank, the day before yesterday to discuss the issue. A solution was agreed upon, but it has not been announced because it needs the mayor's approval. Yesterday, Mayor Wu told a reporter from the Central News Agency that the specific methods to remedy the situation include implementing a business tax and a land tax, which are still under discussion. The business tax will be levied in accordance with the previously announced regulations. The concession areas must also be implemented at the same time. The method has now been agreed upon with the concession authorities. The collection of land donations is not to increase the burden on the people. The land prices in commercial and residential areas of Nanshi and Zhabei have increased to tens of thousands of taels per mu due to commercial prosperity, while the land donations are still the same as those of rural fields in Zhenru, with only one yuan of grain tax per mu, which is clearly unfair. Therefore, it is planned to estimate the land prices in the above two districts and increase the collection proportionally. The implementation date will be at the end of this year or the beginning of next year.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Borrowed Grain Needs to be Postponed Again <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>For the borrowed grain from Jiangsu Province, 4.5 yuan per stone is still owed. It was previously decided that starting from 1930, 9 jiao would be repaid annually until 1934. However, due to the provincial treasury's deficit, the implementation was postponed. This year's winter grain tax is being collected, and it should have been repaid. However, the Shanghai County Government received instructions from the Jiangsu Finance Department yesterday that, due to the province's finances, following last year's floods and then the Shanghai War, the province's treasury revenue and expenditure have been sharply reduced, and income cannot cover expenses. The budget deficit for this year is quite large. It has been submitted to the provincial government for approval, and all borrowed grain that should be repaid this year will be postponed for another year to ease the financial strain. The county government has received the order and immediately instructed the Finance Bureau to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Fishery Trade Opposes Levying Fishery Tax <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>And requests the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to find a way to save the situation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fishery Trade Association, with the recent news that the authorities will implement the levy of a fishery tax, yesterday sent a special letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the government authorities to immediately find a way to save the situation. The original text is recorded as follows: "Respected Sirs, recently, fish merchants from Ningbo and Taizhou have been inquiring with our association, saying that they have recently heard news of a heavy fishery tax being levied. If this is implemented, the fishermen's last hope for survival will be completely deprived. Please help us appeal, etc." Our association believes that fishery trade is closely related, and pays great attention to this matter. Rumors are rampant. On March 28 of last year, the National Government issued an order stating that the fishery industry in our country is declining day by day. If it is not actively promoted and properly protected, it will not be enough to save it and revitalize it. Therefore, the fish tax and fishery tax are all exempted. In the future, no matter what agency, it shall not establish another name to levy this tax, so as to comply with the government's intention to eliminate cumbersome procedures and protect the fishery industry, etc. After the order was received, the fishermen of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were moved to tears, and believed that there was hope. Unexpectedly, after only one year, there was a rumor of the revival of the fishery tax. Alas, our small people are running around telling each other, and we really don't know where to turn for tears. In order to save and revitalize the fishery industry, the National Government specifically exempted the fish tax and fishery tax, and repeatedly stated that no matter what agency in the future, it shall not establish another name to levy this tax. According to our usual reasoning, we thought that with this guarantee, it could be maintained permanently. Now, the decline of the fishery industry is still the same. Can it be said that it has been saved? Can it be said that it has been revitalized? No one can answer this. The government wants to show great faith to the people, or will not change its mind. Only the fishermen are already on the verge of bankruptcy. In addition to the domestic pirates, the dumping of foreign fish is increasing day by day, and they cannot bear to be exploited again. Hearing this rumor, they are extremely alarmed. In addition to sending a telegram to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry to request their assistance, we have sent a special letter to your association, begging you to consider the pain of the fishermen and quickly forward it to save the situation. We are deeply grateful to the public."</p>

Chairman Wu Tiecheng reported on the progress of the previous meeting and elaborated on the recent surge of labor unrest, which requires immediate relief measures. Subsequently, various issues regarding relief for war zone losses were discussed, and most of the results were handed over to the relief group for handling. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>

<p>1,500 silver dollars</p>
<p>The Chaozhou Shanghai Association has donated funds to support the families of the martyrs who died defending the country. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to the Association for Supporting the Families of Martyrs who Died Defending the Country, saying, "To whom it may concern, we previously received a letter from you stating that the funds for supporting the families of the martyrs who died defending the country are in urgent need of fundraising, and requesting us to widely solicit donations and pay the collected funds to the designated receiving bank or money shop, and attached a fundraising donation booklet to our association. During the fierce fighting in the Shanghai War, our association proposed to various groups to raise funds to comfort the families of the martyrs, and asked various groups to discuss the methods. Subsequently, we received a reply from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce agreeing and notifying various groups to raise funds and store them for future use. Our association raised 1,500 yuan and stored it in the bank, and reported it to the Chamber of Commerce for future use. So far, we have not seen the Chamber of Commerce determine the relief method. Your association is actively carrying out the support of the families of the martyrs who died defending the country. We will transfer the 1,500 yuan stored in the bank to your association, which will be filled into the fundraising donation booklet. The funds have been handed over to the Shanghai Bank for collecting donations, and the receipt number is Yihuiyi 1510. Correspondingly, we will send a copy of the fundraising donation booklet with this letter for your review and receipt."</p>
<h3 id="e147">Anti-Drug Association Protests Jiangsu's Opium Monopoly <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Also Thoroughly Opposes the Drug Management Agency</p>
<p>The China National Anti-Drug Association believes that the opium monopoly is intolerable by party discipline and national law, and is the root of national subjugation and racial extermination. It has vowed to oppose all plans for a monopoly that have been brewing in the past, and ultimately achieved the goal of abolishing it through the unanimous demands of the people. Recently, there have been rumors of the revival of the opium monopoly in Jiangsu Province. The association has sent a letter to Chairman Gu Zhutong to inquire, but has never received a reply. In recent days, there has been news of the monopoly being implemented, which is very distressing. It is said that opium bureaus have been established one after another in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Changzhou, Liyang, and Yixing, and local dealers have been appointed as directors. A certain Lu from Fujian has contracted the provincial monopoly tax, and more than 160 boxes of raw opium have been shipped from Hankou to be distributed to various bureaus for sale. In the future, the disaster in Jiangnan will be like a flood that cannot be controlled. In addition to making a serious protest to the Jiangsu authorities and requesting the central government to investigate and deal with the matter according to law, it is planned to submit a proposal to the National Anti-Drug Representative Conference to discuss thorough anti-monopoly measures. The association also believes that the Executive Yuan's decision to designate the Central Hospital as the national anesthetic drug management agency is actually a disguised plan for a drug monopoly. The people behind the scenes are completely pro-monopoly elements, and they are also preparing anti-measures, intending to awaken the people of the whole country to vow to resist to the death. It is expected that the upcoming National Anti-Drug Representative Conference will have serious statements on the above matters. The association also recently received an urgent telegram from the Putian-Xianyou Association in Xiamen, stating that He Xianzhu, who is entrenched in southern Fujian and forces the people to grow opium, has recently slaughtered dozens of villagers for forcibly collecting opium seedling donations, which is extremely indignant. It has sent letters to the Fujian authorities to stop it immediately, and has sincerely submitted a request to the National Government for strict investigation. The original telegram is recorded as follows: [China Anti-Drug Association, Shen Bao, to various agencies, fellow villagers, all are aware, He Xianzhu, commander of bandit suppression in Putian and Xianyou, has been in office for more than a year, extorting millions of dollars.

<h3 id="e149">The Municipal Government Schedules Arbitration for the Sanyou Factory Labor Dispute <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry Telegraphed the Shanghai Labor Protection Section Chief to Consult on Resolution</p>
<p>Party and Government Agencies to Send Personnel to Persuade the Workers to Eat First Today</p>
<p>According to the Dagong Daily, the Sanyou Factory strike dispute has been decided by the Municipal Government to be submitted to arbitration. The Ministry of Industry specially telegraphed Zhang Tiejun, the Chief of the Labor Protection Section of the Ministry in Shanghai, yesterday, instructing him to consult nearby and jointly seek a solution. The fasting workers are still refusing to eat. Party and government agencies will send personnel today to jointly persuade them to resume eating first and wait for a solution. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from the Ministry of Industry: The Ministry of Industry of the National Government telegraphed Zhang Tiejun, Chief of the Labor Protection Section of the Ministry of Industry in Shanghai yesterday, saying, "To Zhang Tiejun, Chief of the Labor Protection Section in Shanghai, recently, we received an urgent letter from the Cotton Textile Industry Workers' Union of the Seventh District of Shanghai, stating that Sanyou Company is delaying the resumption of work, and the workers are desperate for a chance to live. Therefore, Hong Jiaben and 23 others voluntarily went on a hunger strike. Please adopt effective measures to transfer and order an early resolution, and strictly order the capitalists to continue to pay food expenses before the resolution, etc." In addition to telegraphed to the Shanghai Municipal Government, strictly order the capitalists to resume work as soon as possible, and approved outside, the joint telegraph to the Chief of the Section, quickly together with Deputy Director Wang of the Central Committee Wu the Section Chief to consult nearby to resolve the issue to be compassionate to the difficulties of the workers, Ministry of Industry Yang.</p>
<p>Persuade to Eat First: Hong Jiaben and 23 other workers in the factory have been fasting since the 18th, and it has been the eighth day as of yesterday. Those who joined later have also been fasting for five days and nights. During this period, in addition to being force-fed milk once by the General Labor Union, although party and government agencies and the Municipal General Labor Union have repeatedly sent personnel to persuade them to eat, the fasting workers have firmly refused to accept because there is still no hope of a solution. Now the families of the fasting workers have heard the news and have come to Shanghai in large numbers, and the situation is very tragic. If the fasting continues, unfortunate events will inevitably occur. Therefore, Zhu Xuefan, a standing committee member of the General Labor Union, visited Wang Manyun, director of the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Department, and Wang Xianqing, director of the Mediation Section of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday, requesting them to quickly find a way to persuade the workers to eat first and wait for a solution. Directors Wang and Wang also decided to go to the Labor Hospital and Shanghai Hospital today to persuade the workers in writing to resume eating and avoid accidents.</p>
<p>Scheduled Arbitration: The Municipal Government believes that the Sanyou Factory dispute has been mediated repeatedly by the Social Affairs Bureau without success, so it has decided to submit it to arbitration. It has appointed Councilor Luo Panhui as the chairman of the arbitration committee, and has appointed Xu Jiqi as the capitalist member and Zhao Shusheng as the labor member. As for the representative of the Municipal Party Department, it is also heard that Committee Member Lu Jingtulu will attend. Only after the representatives of the special local court and the special first court are appointed can the arbitration begin. However, Councilor Luo believes that the case is extremely urgent, and in order to deal with it quickly, he has decided to convene an arbitration meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the 31st of this month to submit the arbitration.</p>
<p>Relief Meeting: The General Labor Union's Relief Committee for Fasting Workers of Sanyou Factory held its second meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The attending committee members Ye Xianggao, Li Mengnan, Yu Xianting, Chen Peide, and Tan Honglin decided on the following: (1) Submit to the Municipal Government, allowing the Relief Committee to send representatives to attend the arbitration; (2) Continue to send representatives to persuade the workers to eat first; (3) Order all labor unions to donate money to help as much as possible; (4) Schedule another meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the 27th.</p>
<p>Zhang's Talk: A reporter from the Dagong Daily specially visited Zhang Tiejun, Chief of the Labor Protection Section of the Ministry of Industry, yesterday to ask for his opinion on the Sanyou Factory labor unrest and the handling process. He was kindly received and made a speech saying that since the Sanyou labor unrest occurred, the Ministry of Industry has telegraphed me for detailed investigation. A few days ago, Vice Director Wang Lu of the Central Civil Movement Committee and Section Chief Wu Zhongheng of the Workers' Section came to Shanghai, and the Ministry of Industry telegraphed again to ask us to consult together to resolve the issue. After receiving the order, I have repeatedly consulted with Committee Member Wang and Section Chief Wu. As a result, it is believed that the reasons for the Sanyou Company's capitalists to suspend the factory are not sufficient. The company was founded with very little capital at the beginning, and has expanded year by year to achieve its current scale. Regardless of whether it is purely from dividends or additional capital from foreign shares, at least it is mixed with the blood and sweat of the workers. Now, because of a slight setback, it ignores the livelihood of thousands of workers, which is cruel in terms of facts and human feelings. Now that mediation is hopeless, the government has no choice but to adopt extraordinary means and adopt effective compulsory arbitration methods. Yesterday, I and Section Chief Wu visited Mayor Wu to discuss in detail. A considerable method has now been drafted and can be implemented. Today, I went to the Labor Hospital to see the fasting workers, and witnessed the tragic situation of the fasting workers, and felt that the government could not help but seek a solution quickly.</p>

<p>The company held a board meeting yesterday</p>
<p>The workers demand the release of arrested workers</p>
<p>The British-owned public bus strike has continued to this day. Both sides have gone to extremes and there is no solution. The company held a board meeting yesterday to discuss the solution. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Company Meeting: The chairman of the public bus company, A Nuoer (transliteration), noting that the workers' strike has not been resolved for a long time, and that the newly recruited workers are still engaging in corruption, convened a board meeting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday on the third floor of Sassoon House to discuss a solution. The result is unknown.</p>
<p>Workers' Congress: At 5:00 p.m. yesterday, all the workers convened a meeting at the Renhe Teahouse on Wuding Road, with more than 160 people attending. The presidium reported on the situation of petitioning various agencies, and then discussed the three workers who were arrested by the police, who had not taken any out-of-line actions, but have not been released so far. They demanded permission to be released on bail, and decided that when the trial date is set, all workers should wear uniforms to the court to petition for their release, and discussed many other important matters, preparing to continue the struggle.</p>
<p>Continued Dismissal of New Workers: Since the self-ticketing employees went on strike, the company has recruited more than 200 new workers to supplement the workforce in order to maintain operations. However, the batch of workers still engaged in corruption after starting work, so in addition to dismissing more than ten people a few days ago, eight more people were dismissed yesterday.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the issue of managing factories has been considered by the Municipal Council for a long time. It is now heard that it will be re-proposed soon to require all factories, large and small, in the territory to obtain licenses, so that the Municipal Council can manage the factories, and the most important safety, cleanliness, and hygiene for workers' welfare can be enforced. However, in order to make factories obtain licenses, a special meeting of Western taxpayers must be convened to amend the Municipal Council's bylaws and include all factories under the licensed merchants. Once this matter is passed by the Western Taxpayers' Association, the Municipal Council can implement the regulations that licensed merchants must abide by in factories. It is heard that the Western Business Owners' Association has agreed to support this move.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Yongshou Hua Firm Imports Diamonds, Evades Taxes <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Smuggling and Tax Evasion Reaches Over 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Qiu Yongshou Transferred to Local Court</p>
<p>Yongshou Hua Firm Jewelry Store, located at 14 Henan Road, is owned by Qiu Yongshou, a native of Nanjing, specializing in the import and export of jewelry and diamonds. Around September of last year, Qiu ordered a large quantity of diamonds from abroad and successively shipped them to China. He dared to deceive customs and evade taxes. This has happened more than once to this day, with the total tax evaded amounting to over 100,000 yuan. Recently, the Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department discovered this. It secretly ordered the water police station to investigate and verify the facts. At 10:30 AM the day before yesterday, detectives Huang Songsheng and Cheng Yongnian, together with Hua detective chief Pang Ruiqing from the General Police Station, were dispatched to the address to arrest Qiu and take him back to the police station for detention. Inside Yongshou Hua Firm, 12 types of smuggled jewelry and diamonds, worth over 70,000 yuan, were seized. Due to the importance of the case, the police station feared the loss of evidence. It requested instructions from President Zhou of the First Special Court on how to handle the matter. President Zhou appointed Senior Clerk Wan Qian to go to the police station and hand over the seized items to the Westerner Bo Laidi Si, representative of the customs. Yesterday morning, the police station transferred Qiu to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, explained the case and stated that the customs department requested the transfer of the defendant, which the police station did not oppose. However, the defendant hired lawyer Fan Gang to oppose the transfer. Judge Shen Bingrong reviewed and reported the case, and then ruled that Qiu Yongshou be allowed to be transferred to the customs for transfer to the local court. All seized items have been inventoried and handed over to the customs by this court.</p>
<p>According to another report, the firm's smuggling methods are quite ingenious. Because this type of jewelry is not like goods packed in large wooden boxes, these items are small and each person can hide values worth tens of thousands of gold coins. Therefore, each time the firm purchased jewelry from France, it was shipped to Hong Kong to avoid taxes. From Hong Kong to Shanghai, the firm sent people to wait in Hong Kong in advance. After the ship arrived, they hid the jewelry on their persons and returned to Shanghai on the same ship. Although the customs conducted strict inspections, no cases were ever cracked. This time, the discovery was beyond the firm's expectations. It is also heard that this case involves a Frenchman named Marce Juhan. Due to consular jurisdiction, after being detained, he was transferred to the French Consulate for review.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Continued Hearing of the Xu-Hu Lawsuit <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Neither Plaintiff nor Defendant Appeared in Court</p>
<p>Defendant's Lawyer Presented Letters</p>
<p>Xu Jinping (also known as Zhongyi), a Jiahe woman who previously studied at Chizhi University, was betrothed by her family to Fengjing Ye Lishao. Later, she fell in love with Hu Bingheng in Shanghai. Although she married Ye, she maintained a friendly relationship with Hu, alternating between Ye and Hu for five or six years. It was not until last year that she formally divorced Ye. Lawyer Yang Changchi drafted a divorce agreement, stating that the boy, Duansheng, would belong to Ye but would still be raised by Xu until he reached the age of sixteen, when he would return to Ye's family. Ye would provide for his education. After Xu severed her relationship with Ye, she should have become closer to Hu, but the reality was quite the opposite. Not only did their relationship deteriorate, but lawsuits arose frequently. Xu initially filed a criminal complaint against Hu for abandonment and abuse, but it was rejected. Subsequently, she filed a civil lawsuit against Hu, requesting confirmation of her marital status with Hu and asking the court to order Hu to fulfill the contract and pay her 100,000 yuan in consolation money. During the previous hearing in the civil court of the First Special District Local Court, Judge Shen Hong, Xu's ex-husband Ye Lishao, suddenly appeared in court, proving that he and Xu had also fallen in love and married before divorcing. He argued that Xu should not use his son Duansheng as a tool to extort money from Hu. After the adjournment, he intended to accuse her of abducting his child and report her to the prosecutor's office, leading to a major conflict. They immediately reported each other to the criminal court. Although the case had been heard twice, it had not yet concluded. As for the Xu-Hu lawsuit, after it was rescheduled that day, Hu's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, based on the various facts discovered and Ye Lishao's testimony, submitted a written defense. The reasons were divided into two points: (1) regarding the request to confirm the status of wife, (2) regarding the request for consolation money. Regarding the first point, it was asserted that the two parties were merely concubines, and the status of wife was fundamentally untenable. Regarding the second point, it was stated that the document written by Hu was obtained by Xu through fraud and should be invalid according to the law. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Hong held the tenth hearing. The gallery was full, but neither plaintiff nor defendant appeared in person. First, Weng Zhifan, Xu Jinping's lawyer, stated that the defendant had not provided living expenses since June of last year and had moved away the furniture in February of this year, effectively abandoning her. Witnesses could prove this. Hu Bingheng's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, immediately stated that the issue of status should be resolved first before investigating whether there was abandonment. Since the plaintiff did not appear in court and no evidence was presented, it was clear that there was no evidence. Therefore, the defendant would present counter-evidence. If the plaintiff still had evidence but had not brought it to court, it would be appropriate to adjourn the hearing. If it was merely empty talk, there was no need to postpone it. The plaintiff's lawyer continued, "They have been living together for six or seven years. How could there be no evidence? However, my lawyer cannot say for sure before contacting the client." Judge Shen then declared that if there was still evidence to be presented, the hearing could be adjourned; otherwise, the debate would begin immediately. Chen Tingrui immediately stated that all the defendant's important evidence, although previously stated in brief, needed to be presented in detail for the sake of clarifying the case. The most important point emphasized by the plaintiff was that she had the status of wife. The plaintiff had little education, and she sent hundreds of letters to the defendant. Therefore, if the letters related to her so-called status of wife were presented, the issue could be clarified and easily resolved. Chen's lawyer then submitted nine letters from Xu to Hu and explained the important points in each letter one by one. Regarding the first letter, he said that there were words of adultery in the letter. Since she admitted to adultery, she could not have the status of wife. The second letter instructed Hu on how to communicate to avoid being intercepted by others and asked Hu to give all the letters she had given him to Bing Ding. Such secrecy was not befitting of a wife. The third letter contained words such as "the die is cast, regret is useless," which should be the plaintiff's self-pity. The letter also summoned Hu, which showed that the plaintiff was enticing him. The fourth letter said, "Do not reply, for fear of leaking the news and hindering good intentions." If they were husband and wife, why would it be necessary? The fifth letter inquired about the only conclusive proof of their initial encounter on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train. The sixth letter could prove the origins of Rong and Duan, as Xu and Ye had also fallen in love and married before. Rong was born before marriage, and Duan was born after marriage. Ye Lishao had recognized him as his son, but Xu still claimed that Hu was the father. Hu initially did not know this secret. It was not until Ye appeared in court last time that he realized that Rong and Duan were not his children. The seventh and eighth letters were all about Rong and Duan, and were extremely clear. There was also a large package of letters after the ninth letter, which was too numerous to list. Therefore, it was not necessary to present them all. From the above letters, it was not difficult to understand that Hu and Xu had no marital relationship. The evidence of Ye and Xu's marriage and divorce, such as wedding invitations and divorce agreements, had also been presented previously. The agreement stated that Duansheng was Ye's son and was supported by Ye. Now she claimed that he was Hu's son and demanded money, which proved that she was a fraud. After the plaintiff filed the lawsuit, she claimed that she could not afford to pay the litigation fees and requested assistance. The money she had repeatedly extorted from Hu was considerable. It was previously deposited in a money shop, but now it had been withdrawn in full, amounting to over 10,000 yuan. How could she say that she could not afford to pay the fees? Therefore, her request for litigation assistance should be rejected if it had not been approved. If it had already been approved, it should be revoked to curb the unhealthy trend of cunning and contentious litigation. He also presented three passbooks as evidence. Then, Fei Yinshi, a Yangzhou woman who had worked in the plaintiff's house, testified that she had been employed by Xu Jinping since September 4 of the previous year and resigned on January 4 of this year. She called Xu "Grandma." There were only a young brother, a young sister, and Grandma in her family. In addition, there was a young master Chen who came every other day, usually in the afternoon, but never stayed overnight. The two children never called out to young master Chen. There was also a young master Pan who came every few months and always stayed overnight. Pan was from Nanhui, but after Pan came, Grandma always told me not to talk nonsense. This time, Grandma was involved in a lawsuit with young master Chen. I was found by someone to come to this place, etc. Xu's lawyer gave the woman a newspaper with photos of Hu and Xu and asked her who was young master Chen. The woman said that the printing was blurred and she could not identify them. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that this woman was the plaintiff who recently accused Xu Jinping of abducting her son in the Second Special Court. Judge Shen asked about the reason for accusing Xu of abducting the child and announced that the case would be adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Land Dispute Over Several Fractions of Land Lasts Nearly 30 Years <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Disputed Land Had Long Been Transferred</p>
<p>Lawsuit Resurfaces After Several Years</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, Zheng Huahua and Jin Xiaoyun were unable to resolve a dispute over several fractions of land near the Nicheng Bridge. They sued in the former Mixed Court, which, after repeated investigations, rendered a decision on August 4, 1921. However, Zheng was still dissatisfied and requested a retrial, listing four items of claim: (1) return of the land, rejecting monetary compensation; (2) compensation of 1,341 yuan and 57 cents for land rent from the defendant; (3) reimbursement of 2,000 taels for litigation costs; (4) permission to collect the 1,000 yuan security deposit paid by the defendant as compensation for damages. The retrial of this case resulted in a decision on April 10, 1922, rejecting it for insufficient grounds. Subsequently, the Mixed Court was reorganized, and the Provisional Court simultaneously established an appellate court. Zheng then appealed to the appellate court. After reviewing the entire case file, the appellate court found that the appellant had not declared a reservation of appeal during the Mixed Court era, which was inconsistent with the agreed terms. The appeal was immediately rejected. At that time, Zheng accepted the verdict and did not declare an appeal again. Unexpectedly, Zheng Huahua had now died, and a woman named Zheng Wu, claiming to be Hua's wife, filed a retrial lawsuit with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, stating that after the judgment of the Mixed Court, her husband had submitted a petition to the Shanghai Daoyin's Office, but the office had not summoned him. There was now a draft of the appeal petition that could be used as evidence, and she requested that a retrial be granted. However, the defendant, Jin Xiaoyun, had also passed away many years ago, and his son, Jin Fenggang, hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to argue the case according to the law, listing six reasons. First, the issue of whether the main party applying for a retrial was qualified still needed to be studied, as the woman was actually being used and was a mere puppet, which was extremely hateful. Second, he thoroughly described the repeated trial and judgment process of this case. Finally, based on the precedents of the Supreme Court, he proved that it did not meet the requirements for a retrial and requested that it be rejected. The Second Branch of the High Court found that the arguments of both parties were contradictory and it was impossible to understand the truth without summoning witnesses for interrogation. During the initial hearing, Zheng Wu took the opportunity not to appear. The defendant believed that in order to clarify the truth, the woman must appear in court for questioning, so he requested that she be summoned. During the second hearing yesterday morning, the woman still did not appear. After Judge Hu questioned the witnesses who were present, he ordered the debate to begin. Then, the two lawyers representing Zheng Wu, Tao and Zhong, debated with the defendant's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, until the end. The official announced that the decision would be postponed to a later date. This case has been in litigation for nearly 30 years. The disputed land has long been transferred, but both parties still do not give up. It is truly the longest-lasting case in the First Special District.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Customs to Confiscate Ships in Violation <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Da Mei Wan Bao says that the steamship Bo Erxi Te, flying the British flag, arrived in Shanghai from Australia on August 9. The ship was carrying 75 dogs for the dog racing track, and unloaded them at a location near the Shanghai coast, and tried to transport them into the concession. The customs authorities discovered this, and now intend to announce the whole case. The ship is being held in port, and it is possible that it will be confiscated. According to Article 47 of the Treaty of Tianjin in 1858, British merchant ships are not allowed to sail to ports other than those opened up by the treaty, or to engage in improper trade along the coast. Any ship that violates this provision may be confiscated by the Chinese government, along with its cargo. It is heard today that the customs authorities will apply this provision to deal with the ship. The ship is 165 tons, built in 1911, and was originally a German coal carrier. It is currently registered in the name of Enkshi of the local Enkshi Company. Enkshi traveled to Australia a few months ago to drive the ship to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Zhang Rongchu, the manager of the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company, used inferior goods to counterfeit the company's products in an attempt to make private profits. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately investigated and understood the details, which were reported in previous reports. Yesterday, the company sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, stating that it had approved Zhang Rongchu's resignation. The Chamber of Commerce believed that it had not earnestly fulfilled the layer of thorough investigation according to law and did not approve the company's request. The original letters are recorded below: (1) Letter from the Printing and Dyeing Company: To the esteemed members of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, I am writing in response to your kind letter. Our association convened a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to approve the resignation of General Manager Zhang Rongchu pending investigation. The company has compiled all the original blank contract orders and decided to publish them in major newspapers from today onwards. At the same time, the company has publicly appointed managers Chen Zhibi and Xie Qingqing to be fully responsible for all company affairs. We hope that your association will guide and maintain us in the future. We look forward to it. (2) Reply from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: We received your letter on the 25th of this month, stating that Zhang Rongchu's resignation has been approved, and the orders have also been announced. Please maintain the exports as usual, etc. It was submitted to the ninth standing committee meeting for discussion, and it was decided that the first point of the three points resolved by the Executive Committee, that Zhang Rongchu should be thoroughly investigated according to law, has not been earnestly fulfilled, and only the approval of resignation pending investigation is a perfunctory plan. The request is not approved. The corresponding record is sent back in a letter, please check.</p>

<p>Special Temporary Office Set Up in Shanghai</p>
<p>Exemption from Tax and Transportation Fees for Solicited National Products</p>
<p>Chen Shaofu, the director of the National Products Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry, came to Shanghai in person to handle the details of the exhibition for the third anniversary of the museum on September 9. It is heard that after the director of the museum established a temporary office in Shanghai at the Great China Hotel on Xizang Road, he telegraphed Huang Keqiang and other staff members of the museum to bring the national government's tax exemption certificate and the shipping and train fare reduction list to various places, and immediately sent letters to various manufacturers to send their products to the office for shipment. Upon hearing the news, the merchants all said it was convenient, so there was a lot of enthusiasm for manufacturers to send their goods to the office. It is also heard that the museum director Chen Shaofu presented it to Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry, in order to implement the promotion of national products and reward manufacturers. The Ministry of Industry hired national product experts to organize a national product review committee to seriously review the national products participating in the exhibition, classify them into different grades, and award certificates to show the government's intention to promote national products and encourage manufacturers.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Bean and Rice Industry Decides to Stop Shipping Xiangmao Reserved Rice <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Because of What? Slandering the Reason of Da Youheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association convened an emergency meeting of colleagues yesterday afternoon, because the northern industry colleague Da Youheng booked Cheng Xiaojiao rice from Xiangmao Foreign Firm, and discussed a temporary delay in delivery. Unexpectedly, the foreign firm posted a notice slandering Da Youheng for closing down, and sued the court for sealing. At the meeting Da Youheng reported that previously, on behalf of the customer, one hundred tons of Cheng Xiaojiao rice was booked from Xiangmao Foreign Firm. The rice arrived in port, just after the incident, when the financial situation was suspended, so the foreign firm was discussed a temporary delay in delivery, and the warehouse rent and interest were acknowledged. Unexpectedly, Xiangmao Foreign Firm published an advertisement the week before last, slandering Da Youheng for stopping business, and it was in the process of negotiation. Unexpectedly, the foreign firm sued the local court to seal my firm, causing long-term losses in business. The rice that was previously booked is calculated in accordance with the current market, and the warehouse rent and interest only amounted to over a thousand taels. At that time, it was acknowledged, and the advertisements published in the newspaper were reviewed, and the colleagues were very angry. The colleagues in the industry all have fixed foreign rice in trade with Xiangmao Foreign Firm. Now the amount of rice fixed by Da Youheng is very small. Xiangmao Foreign Firm published advertisements slandering the closure of business and sued the court to seal Da Youheng. This matter is related to the harm to all colleagues in the industry. After discussion by the public, it was decided that the rice purchased from Xiangmao Foreign Firm by my colleagues would be suspended for shipment from today. After this case is over, a method will be decided, and a letter will be sent to the Miscellaneous Grain Association to notify colleagues of various gangs. Da Youheng should file a counterclaim with the court, and my colleagues should unanimously help. For the goods traded by the Miscellaneous Grain Association between colleagues and foreign merchants, the foreign merchants all use Western characters to make the bill of exchange, and the association is currently striving to negotiate to write all the bills of exchange for goods ordered with foreign merchants in Chinese, and that will be effective.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Liu Ruiheng Reports on the Recent Situation of Cholera in Shaanxi and Henan <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>To Zhu Qinglan's Letter</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, cholera has been most prevalent in the disaster areas of Shaanxi and Henan provinces. Previously, Zhu Ziqiao, director of the Disaster Area Work Group of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, repeatedly telegraphed Liu Ruiheng, director of the Nanjing Health and Epidemic Prevention Team, asking him to send doctors and medicines to treat them as soon as possible. The letter from Liu is recorded below, so that the general public can read it and know what to prevent.</p>
<p>Zi Qiao Sir, I acknowledge the frequent attention to the prevention of cholera in the two provinces of Yu and Shaanxi. I have repeatedly replied to you. I have also invited you to see it. Now I have received a letter from Sun Runchen, the technical officer sent by this department to guide epidemic prevention in the two provinces of Yu and Shaanxi. The member investigated in detail in Tongguan, Xi'an, Lintong, Weinan, Huazhou, Huayin, and other cities, villages, towns, and forts. The reason for the rampant cholera this year, in addition to flies as the medium of infection, is especially important, because the public does not understand the importance of isolation and disinfection. Therefore, when one person is sick, all relatives who are attending to the illness and visiting the sick, and those who are in contact with washing the patient's clothes, are infected with the disease, and the infection spreads, and it becomes a prairie fire. The member has already drafted simple chapters and propaganda methods and handed them over to the Shaanxi Epidemic Prevention Committee to promote and publicize, so that the public can understand the importance of isolation, in order to reduce the path of infection. In Tongguan County this time, it is estimated that about 800 people died and about 3,000 were infected. The matters that should be handled in the prevention of cholera previously telegraphed to the province by this department have been handled in order, and the department will assist in 5,000 bottles of cholera vaccine for preventive injections. It is found that the deaths of patients in Tongguan and Xi'an have been reduced. In Henan, the number of counties reporting the epidemic has reached more than 30, and the area near Luoyang is the most severe. The central government agencies in Luoyang, together with the local organization of the Xingdu Epidemic Prevention Committee, are actively carrying out all prevention and control work. The member and the physician Niu Zengshu, who was previously sent to Luo by this department, stayed in Luo separately and went to other epidemic areas to guide prevention and control. The department assisted in 3,000 bottles of vaccine, which were allocated in batches for preventive injections. Health inspector Yang Qixiong was transferred to various epidemic areas today to guide the local creation of disinfection work for well water and drinking water. After becoming proficient in one place, he would be transferred to other places for guidance, and the local learning staff would continue to handle it, in order to make it universal. I am concerned about the public's suffering, and I am always concerned about the epidemic situation in the Central Plains. I am very pleased to tell you about one or two. I respectfully wish you peace, your brother Liu Ruiheng. August 20.</p>

<p>Detectives from the Special Branch of the French Concession Police arrested three kidnappers, Zheng Shifan, Zhang Afu, etc., in connection with the kidnapping of Pu Wenting and Qian Shanguan. They were handed over to the court to await further investigation. According to Zheng et al., two accomplices from Wuxi, Gao A'da (aka Niu Bitou A'da) and Chen Liangqing, were hiding in Wuxi.

<h3 id="e171">### Monks of Yishou Chan Temple Violate Monastic Rules <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>A Buddhist Sanctuary</p>
<p>Turns into a Den of Iniquity</p>
<p>The Yishou Chan Temple, commonly known as Zhu Tianjun Temple, is located on Gansu Road behind the First Special District Court. It usually attracts many worshippers, especially those who participate in flower lotteries. The abbot of the temple, Qian Guang (aka Fa Kun), is addicted to opium. He has set up a smoking set in his Zen room upstairs, where he reclines and smokes. More than ten of his monks are also addicted and have beds and opium sets in their rooms. When there are Buddhist services, benefactors who are addicted to opium are also welcome to go upstairs for a smoke. The price of opium, regardless of the amount, is left to their discretion. As a result, the upstairs of the temple is filled with smoke and stench. Yao Jialin, the Chinese inspector of District C of the Hongkou Police Station, learned of this and secretly investigated the temple. After confirming the facts, he reported to the Special Court and obtained a search warrant. He went to the temple at 9 a.m. the day before yesterday and went straight upstairs, where he found three rooms with people smoking opium and taking red pills. He arrested the abbot Qian Guang, the guest monks Lin Qiang, Pu Qing, Miao Xing, Ke Jin, Hua He, and the servant Wu Ashou, totaling seven people. He confiscated six opium pipes, four opium lamps, one pound and thirteen ounces of raw opium, two bags of opium paste, a large number of red pills, opium dregs, opium trays, two vats of opium paste, as well as tonic bird's nests, white fungus, deer antlers, yellow croaker paste, and silver dollars. He took everything to the Huisi Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Wang Yaotang stated the above facts, stating that the defendants were monks and should abide by the monastic rules. However, they openly smoked opium in the Buddhist sanctuary, transforming it into a den of iniquity. He requested severe punishment and asked for the temple to be sealed. Inspector Yao reported the circumstances of the arrest, stating that he had personally investigated the temple's neighbors and sent women disguised as worshippers to smoke opium before making the arrests. He presented the opium sets and opium paste as evidence. When questioned, all defendants except Hua He and Wu Ashou admitted to smoking opium. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confessions and sentenced Qian Guang (aka Fa Kun) to three months of imprisonment and a fine of 300 yuan. Hua He and Wu Ashou were found not guilty. The remaining four, Lin Qiang et al., were sentenced to two months of imprisonment and a fine of 20 yuan each. The opium paste and opium sets were confiscated, and the remaining items were returned. The police station should file a separate request for the temple to be sealed.</p>

<p>Daxin Silk and Satin Bureau, located at the corner of Shilu and Sanma Road, has always been dedicated to promoting domestic silk and satin and regaining control of interests. Since the January 28 Incident in Shanghai, the bureau has increasingly felt that the way to resist Japan and save the country is to actively promote domestic goods. It has successively ordered dozens of kinds of new and fashionable fabrics from famous domestic factories. The fabrics are durable, have a rich texture, and are affordable, which appeals to the general public. At a time when the social economy and people's purchasing power are weak, the bureau's order is sure to be well received. This is not only a celebration of the bureau's business development but also good news for the promotion of domestic goods. It is said that the ordered goods of various colors have arrived in Shanghai one after another, and the bureau is selling them at discounted prices to ensure sales.</p>

<p>Store Site Also to Be Sold</p>
<p>The main distribution center of Civilization Bookstore on Nanjing Road in this city has announced its closure and is selling off all kinds of inventory at discounted prices, such as books, rubbings, records, mirror frames, screens, paintings, etc. Many of the bookstore's products are excellent, especially the rubbings and paintings, which are exquisitely made. The discounted price is only 10% to 60% of the original price. A clearance sale department has also been set up to display books of foreign and domestic editions accumulated over the years, with particularly low prices starting from a few copper coins, some being less than 10% of the original price.

<h3 id="e184">Taboo of the Zhan Lu <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Many of the taboos passed down are a kind of traditional social superstition.</p>
<p>Westerners avoid the number thirteen. We Chinese do not need to avoid the number thirteen. However, those who are infatuated with Westernization must also avoid thirteen for a moment, as a modern habit of showing off. People from Yan avoid saying forty-five, as recorded in Wu Yifeng's "Xun Zhi Tang Za Chao":</p>
<p>"People from Yan avoid saying forty-five. If someone asks them, they do not say, 'Last year I was forty-four years old,' but instead say, 'Next year I will be forty-six years old.'"</p>
<p>People from Lu avoid saying forty-one, as recorded in Wang Xiaoyin's "Fu Xuan Xu Yu":</p>
<p>"There is often a kind of vulgar saying among the common people that people compete to avoid it. For example, when a person reaches the age of forty-one, they avoid saying it. If someone asks, they answer with evasive words, or simply say the taboo year directly, without any understanding, which is quite laughable." This passage describes the customs of Shandong province.</p>
<p>People from Wu avoid the word "slave" by using the word "nose," as recorded in Chu Bunong's "Jian Hu Ji":</p>
<p>"In Wu customs, the word 'slave' is avoided by using the word 'nose.' The explanation is: 'To decorate the facade.' Or it is said: 'The elephant's nose can touch people, and the pig's nose is good at digging the ground,' which means causing trouble."</p>
<p>People from Zhejiang avoid the word "duck," as recorded in Zhuang Chuo's "Ji Lei Bian":</p>
<p>"People from Zhejiang greatly avoid using 'duck' as a name. Ducks only have one male, and although they mate, there are no eggs. Two or three males are needed to have offspring. It is believed that the taboo is because of this."</p>
<p>Among the various taboos mentioned above, the Wu custom of avoiding "slave" by using "nose" is now rarely seen. Occasionally, when talking about servants, the words "tip of the nose" are still used instead. The Zhejiang custom of avoiding "duck" is also no longer the case. However, the author of "Ji Lei Bian" lived in the Song Dynasty, so what he said was naturally the custom of the Song people. This reminds me of the novel "Water Margin," where Yun Ge treats Wu Dalang as a fat duck. Wu Da said, "My wife doesn't steal men, so how am I a duck?" According to this, the Song people avoided "duck" in a way similar to how people today avoid "turtle." And the place where it was avoided was not limited to Zhejiang province. Wu Da was from Qinghe County, Shandong, and he also knew to avoid "duck," which shows that the custom of avoiding "duck" was very common among the Song people.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Japanese Troops Are Not to Be Feared <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Quchang</p>
<p>The Japanese bandits have been deeply invading us for eleven months now. Those who plan for the country are only intimidated by their past ferocity and dare not speak of war. They say that ten days is enough to destroy our country, or even that it cannot be defended for even one day. One voice echoes another, forming an unbreakable consensus. Even if there are one or two loyal and brave men who are aroused by righteous indignation and rise up, they seem to deeply agree with it, but are actually deeply afraid of it. Therefore, they ultimately hesitate between peace and war. Now the Japanese have invaded Rehe and are spying on Pingjin. Although those who plan for the country speak of uniting to resist the invasion, I fear that they may still be intimidated by their ferocity and procrastinate, causing mistakes. Therefore, I cite past events and solemnly tell them: Facts ultimately prevail over empty words. What is there to fear about the Japanese? In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, in the Battle of the Datong River, Ma Zhongwu, with a few thousand exhausted soldiers, faced more than 20,000 stubborn Japanese troops, and was also trapped in a heavy encirclement. The situation was precarious, but Ma's army ultimately broke through the encirclement and achieved excessive casualties. And in the Battle of Incheon, Ye Zhichao also broke through the encirclement with 2,000 weak soldiers and returned to Pyongyang. Are the Japanese really good at fighting? Are we really unable to fight? This is one point. In the Battle of Pyongyang, our army used 15,000 men to defend against the invading bandits, but only 8,000 were actually capable of fighting. Moreover, the generals were timid, the soldiers were lazy, the land was vast, the forces were divided, and the command was not unified. The enemy attacked with five times the number of troops. It seemed that they could not hold on for a moment. However, they still fought fiercely for four days before being defeated. Are the Japanese really capable of defending? This is the second point. Their defeat against Russia was not because the Japanese were able to win. Russia actually defeated itself. Before the war, it was already full of holes and sores, and it was exhausting and far from its base. Those who knew the situation had long concluded that there was no chance of victory. However, the Japanese still repeatedly fell into bitter fighting, suffering as many as 200,000 casualties. The chieftain Ooyama Iwao was so ashamed that he committed suicide, and the chief of staff Kodama Gentaro even prayed to the east every day, begging for blessings. It can also be seen that their strength was exhausted and they were begging for help. This is the third point. However, this is still a matter of the past. Some people think that it cannot be discussed today. In the Jinan Incident in 1928, our army's city defenders were only 500 men. The bandits attacked with twice the number of troops but ultimately could not succeed. Afterwards, when our army withdrew and broke through the encirclement under orders, the bandits were almost defeated. At that time, a reporter from the Osaka Asahi Shimbun in Japan described the embarrassment of their army in a telegram. The chief of staff Kuroda Shuroku saw it and was greatly ashamed and angry, accusing him of not loving the country and not being able to conceal their military affairs. (This is according to Gong Junde's words). This is enough to show the uselessness of their army. This is the fourth point. As for the Battle of Shanghai, the Japanese倾 country with half of its forces to deal with one corner, and even changed its commander four times. This is even more obvious and needs no further discussion. This is the fifth point. The Japanese have a conscription system. The soldiers are mostly from the middle class and are accustomed to comfort. When they leave their families, they tearfully plead for safety and pray to the gods for blessings. They are no longer the fierce warriors who prayed for death in the past. Therefore, once they are trapped in bitter fighting, they flee together. This can be seen from the battles of Shanghai and the Northeast. This is the sixth point. Moreover, since the Japanese won against Russia, they have not encountered a major enemy. Generals below the rank of lieutenant general indulge in armchair strategy and have never been trained in battle. They are also mired in inertia and given to lasciviousness. Every time they send troops, they take geishas with them. An army goes out with discipline. Do the Japanese really have discipline? This is the seventh point. Considering the past, it is like that. Examining the present, it is like this. If they cannot fight, cannot attack, and cannot go out with discipline, but only rely on their superior weapons and arrogance to try to succeed, what is there to fear about them? The Xuanju ant has its advantages. When the ant's nest is destroyed, and the red ants spy at the door, it must use its clan to bite and kill them, eventually staying far away from the leeches. If there is no mutual assistance, then the stupid people must have something to protect them. Now the spies at the door are approaching. If we cannot be like the Xuanju ant to bite the enemy, but want the people to protect the broken nest, how can we get it? Alas! Can we be inferior to the Xuanju ant? Moreover, they are not even worthy of fear.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Silver Car of the Overseas Chinese <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Huanhua</p>
<p>The progress of extravagance among the people of Shanghai in recent years can be described as rapid. However, due to the many hidden dangers lurking, they cannot help but be cautious and dare not make any excessive moves. Otherwise, with the kind of flamboyant big bosses and young masters, the use of silver cars as a form of display would have happened long ago, and they would never have allowed other places or other families to enjoy such exclusivity first, right?</p>
<p>I have a friend who does business in Penang, and we recently reunited after a long separation. He told me a strange story:</p>
<p>Many of the overseas Chinese businessmen in Penang have become rich through business. Among them, a Mr. Chen from Quanzhou, Fujian, has accumulated more than ten million in assets. He is naturally fond of spending and enjoys everything to the extreme. A few years ago, he suddenly had a whimsical idea and ordered a silver-shelled car from a famous British car factory at the cost of 300,000 gold coins. Soon, the car arrived, causing a sensation in the local community.</p>
<p>On the first day he rode in it, a small twist occurred. As he was riding in the silver car from his residence to his company to do business, a policeman stopped the car and said to him: "The police chief requests Mr. Chen to have an important matter to discuss in person." Chen and the police chief had a personal relationship. Since the police chief requested his presence, he could not refuse, so he ordered the driver to drive the car to the police station.</p>
<p>Upon entering, a guard led him to the waiting room. He was shocked because he had never broken the law. What was the reason for this? Before long, he was questioned. The police chief said as soon as he saw him: "I have received orders from the governor that Mr. Chen is too extravagant and actually rides in a silver car, which is more excessive than the English emperor. He should be charged with a corresponding crime." Mr. Chen argued, "If silver cars are not allowed, and riding in silver cars should be prohibited and punished, please show me which article and item of the law states this. I am a law-abiding businessman who has never broken the law. There is no reason for the government to detain me. Although the police chief claims that it is the governor's order, there is no specific article for punishing extravagance. Therefore, what kind of judgment should be made for the governor's defamation of a law-abiding citizen's reputation and infringement of a law-abiding citizen's freedom? I am a person in business and my time is very valuable. I cannot stay here for long. Moreover, I must ride in the silver car." Chen was fluent in English and spoke very reasonably. Nearly a thousand people were listening and nodded in agreement. The police chief hesitated for a while before agreeing to report to the governor for instructions. Later, he announced: "Mr. Chen's use of a silver car for transportation is not what a law-abiding person should have. However, considering that there is no illegal behavior, he is exempt from punishment." Mr. Chen finally won the case and continued to enjoy his silver car in peace.</p>
<h3 id="e187">A Student Obsessed with Detective Novels <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Laoren</p>
<p>Martial arts novels have the strongest influence on young people's minds. Newspapers often report news of young people leaving home and going to the ends of the earth to find sword-wielding immortals and knights, which is enough to prove it to us. However, the reality is becoming more and more bizarre. A senior high school in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, recently discovered a student who was so obsessed with reading detective novels that he committed crimes and had wild ideas, setting fires in the school building more than ten times. It was not until several months later that the case was solved. He told the principal, "Although I unfortunately failed, I am very proud. On the one hand, it can prove that the school authorities' detective methods are immature. For me, who has rich experience, it is naturally not easy to subdue me." This kind of strange thing can truly be said to be unprecedented. The school is one of the most famous high schools in Zhejiang Province and was founded entirely with funds raised by Christians. At the beginning of the spring semester of this year, there were several consecutive fires in the school building. The brand-new library suffered heavy losses due to the visit of the god of fire. The school authorities took all kinds of precautions but still could not avoid it. They had to encourage all students to pay attention and observe secretly at all times. Over time, not only was the case not solved, but it became more and more serious. Fires were also reported in the most secluded places in the school. This caused panic and confusion among all the students. They organized a patrol team to patrol day and night. On the one hand, they were afraid that it was the work of fox spirits, so they had to set up an altar and offer fresh fruits every day, hoping that they would stop playing jokes. Who knew that one night, several students went to the playground for a walk. Suddenly, they saw a child setting a fire. They thought that the opportunity was not to be missed, so they rushed forward and grabbed the arsonist. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a junior high school student. He said that the arson was entirely instigated by a senior high school student. His only purpose for setting the fire was to test in the field whether the average person had the ability to solve the case, completely indulging in detective novels. After receiving the confession, the school authorities immediately expelled the detective novel enthusiast. From then on, the bizarre fire disappeared without a trace.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Secret History of the Twenty-One Demands (4) <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Si Pin</p>
<p>Moore and Donner returned from their trip to the East and were very alarmed when they learned of this matter. Tong came to see me with them. Moore was very angry that his assistant had sent such a telegram to the United States without verifying it with Heki. Donner also took a copy of the Twenty-One Demands and said to me that he had been severely questioned by the consulate for this matter. As a result, both of them resigned from their positions in London and New York.</p>
<p>Moore had shown the Twenty-One Demands to Heki. Heki strongly denied it. However, Moore had already found out the source of the news and was convinced that the demands were real. Therefore, I also went to visit Heki, knowing that he would also deny the matter to me. I first sent my secretary Lewis to see Reinsch with twenty demands and asked him whether the information he had received about the Twenty-One Demands came directly from Yuan Shikai. In his answer to Lewis, Reinsch revealed a sentence, implying that he had spoken to Yuan Shikai once. He also told Lewis that he had taken pictures of the Japanese version of the Twenty-One Demands and translated them into English. He took the Twenty-One Demands that Lewis had brought to another room to compare them with his translation. He told Lewis, "Bishop Favre took these Twenty-One Demands to see Heki. Don't be afraid that he will accuse Bishop Favre of intentionally slandering Japan."</p>
<p>Then I went to see Heki. After exchanging greetings, I directly discussed the Twenty-One Demands with him. I said that it would be easy for Japan to occupy the coastal ports of China and Beijing. However, since Japan obtained Taiwan in 1896, it has not completely conquered it. Although Taiwan is just a small island with a railway, Japan would have to rely on military force to maintain it. Japan has spent twenty years of operation and still cannot conquer an island with a population of three million. How long would it take Japan to conquer the entire China with a population of 400 million?</p>
<p>I further pointed out several facts and said to him that in the seventeenth century, the people of Sichuan revolted against the Qing Dynasty and it was not until a quarter of them died that the rebellion was suppressed. Now Sichuan has a population of 68 million, 1,500 miles from the coast and 1,000 miles from the nearest railway. I recently visited Sichuan and the anti-Japanese sentiment in the province is strong. If Sichuan Province is determined to fight to the death, Japan will not be able to conquer it even if it uses troops for half a century. Furthermore, the Taiping Rebellion lasted for more than ten years and resulted in the deaths of 20 million people before it was quelled. I said to Heki earnestly that China is a vast country with a large population, and the people are determined to die. If they engage in guerrilla warfare with the Japanese, Japan will never have any hope of annexing China. Even the great powers will never allow Japan to control China and endanger world peace. Even if Japan swallows China, I believe that the great powers will definitely force Japan to withdraw from China, just like the story of forcing Japan to withdraw from the Liaodong Peninsula in 1896. I hope that Japan will not bring disgrace upon itself. Moreover, Japan is now heavily in debt. It would be best to follow the example of Britain and strive to develop its industry and commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e189">No Special Changes in Finance and Gold Market <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The market situation was extremely mediocre. Yesterday's gold price trend was ordinary, with no special changes. It fluctuated rapidly and restlessly. There were six taels of retrospection throughout the day, and it ultimately fell slightly by three cents, which was the opposite of the situation the day before yesterday. Various firms traded frequently, but the path of each tended to be slightly lower at first. The overseas silver market showed a decline in England and a flat market in the United States. The futures silver market was firm, and people's hearts softened. Then, due to the diligence of the sellers, the exchange rate recovered slightly, and the foreign exchange rate was stable, so progress was expected. The price rose by four taels. At noon, the exchange rates of England and the United States tended to loosen, especially with large households selling short, and the selling trend was very strong, suddenly showing a sluggish state. The 710 tael mark was eventually broken, and the market presented a scattered image. However, the exchange rate was still stable and the banks were still willing to absorb it, so the market price was slightly firm. As for spot goods, Dafenghang and others sold about 200 bars to a certain bank, which caused the US exchange rate to fall to 715 taels and 5 cents. Here is a detailed account of the whole day.</p>
<p>The morning market tended to rise and then fall. At the beginning of the morning, the October futures opened down seven cents, at 711 taels and 5 cents. Although large bars were reduced by one-sixteenth, the silver price remained the same and the foundation was firm. This affected it. Yuanxing, Yonghengxing, Yuanwu, and others sold out, and it fell again to 10 taels and 02 cents. Suddenly, Tongchang, Yuanheng, Dehe, Hengxing, Yuankang, Xiangzhao, Fengchang, and others came to the market to buy. In addition, the private telegram silver price went down slightly by one-sixteenth, and it rose by more than three taels, reaching 13 taels and 6 cents at 9:15. The exchange rate was stable. HSBC first absorbed 31 US dollars for this month and another 375 for December forward contracts. However, Tongtaichang sold out and immediately dropped by 1 tael and 1 cent. Yuanheng, Hengchangyong, and others re-entered, Zhongfu absorbed 375 US dollars for December, Meifeng offered 30.875 US dollars for August, Yingbi absorbed 9375 for September, and the price returned to more than 1 tael. At 9:30, the opening price of English gold was unchanged, at 14 taels and 2 cents. Bingxing, Hongkang, Yonghengxing, Tongtaichang sold, and it became 12 taels and 7 cents. Suddenly, it was heard that the Central Bank was buying spot goods, and Fuyu, Yuanheng, Yuanmao, Yongyi, Yonglai re-entered. Around 10:00, the price was 14 taels and 2 cents twice. After entering, Dalian Gang and Yuanxingyong, Tongchang, Zhaofengchang, Futaiheng, Yuanda, Zhifengyong and other goods were successively sold out. Until November, English gold 1.9625 was available for both buying and selling. At about 10:20, it was 11 taels and 9 cents. Not long after, Yuanheng, Hengkangyong, Zhaofengchang re-entered, Anyuan bought 375 US dollars for December, HSBC Huabi Shanghai absorbed 4375 for December, and it was nearly 13 taels and 2 cents until 11:00. In an instant, the selling trend suddenly became strong. Bingxing, Fuyu, Hengchangyong, Yuanzhifengyong, Yuanda, Decheng and others dumped their goods, and the price fell back by two or three taels. From 11:00 to 11:30, there was only a small turnover within one tael, and the December US dollar was even calculated at half a dollar. Goods for hedging and Yuanxingyong, Wu, and others sold very hard, and Hengyu, Qianchang, Xiangyuantai, and others also sold accordingly, so the price was difficult to support, and it had already broken ten taels. Until 11:45, it was 08 taels and 2 cents, with a sense of decline. At that time, Hengxingyuan, Ruikang, and others came to buy, immediately adding 1 tael and 0, to 09 and a half taels, and Bingxing sold again, falling back to 08 taels and 8 cents. The price at noon was 9 taels and 4 cents.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, it gradually entered a dull phase. The market opened at ten taels. Although Jingfu Zhao listed it and sold it, fortunately there were many buyers, and HSBC and Citibank had absorbed the December US dollar at 31.4375 yuan before the market opened. Zhengjin bought the English gold for the month at 4375, and people's hearts immediately strengthened. Then Tongtaichang, Zhaofengchang, Zhifengyong, Shunli and others had a strong intention to buy, reaching 12 taels and 1 cent at 2:45. Huabi offered 375 US dollars for December and 6875 for December English gold forward contracts. Hengxingyuan, Qianchangxiang, Hengxingyuanxingyong and others all sold, falling back by more than 1 tael, reaching 10 taels and 08 cents at 3:30. However, from 2:50 to 3:15, it only calculated several cents up and down. After entering, Zhifengyong bought in, and in just ten minutes, it rose by 1 tael and 2 cents, calculated at 12 taels. Qianchangxiang and Dalian Gang sold slightly, reducing it by 5 cents, reaching 11 and a half taels. Until the August US dollar came out of Magali at 9375, soon after the August English gold was forward contracted by the Sino-Japanese Bank at 4375, and there seemed to be many buyers in the market, including Zhaofengchangyong and others. Near 4:00, it was 12 taels and 1 cent, then closed at 11 taels and 9 cents, returning a small three cents from the previous noon, continuing to do so until 2 taels and 0. According to the daily maximum price of 14 taels and 2 cents, and the minimum of 08 taels and 2 cents, the difference was 6 taels, and the red bar still added nine and a half taels.</p>
<p>The listed price was suppressed by 73 and 74 taels. The listed price was unchanged due to the US exchange rate, so it was still 784 taels, calculated at a pressure of 70 taels to 74 taels, and from 74 taels to 72 taels in the afternoon, which was the same as the previous noon. The registered amount was also 709 taels, with a replenishment of 09 taels, and 12 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The in-field cash transactions were still frequent and the over-the-counter transactions were quite strong, but the cash transactions were different. Statistics showed that Yuanheng, Hengxingyuan, Zhaofengchang, Yifengyong, Hengchangyong, and Hongkangyong all entered, Hengxing, Wanxing, Daxingyong, Hengyu, and Fuyu had different ins and outs, Yuanxingyong, Wu, Qianchangxiang, Yuanda, Futaiheng, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, Yuhe, Dachengyuan, Maoyong, goods, hedging, etc. all sold out uniformly. Tongtaichang sold out about 1,000, Shunli had more sales than deliveries. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Tongtaichang, and Yuhe all entered, and Shunli had more supply than demand. Yuanxingyong, Hengxingyuan, Hengchangyong, Hengxing, Dachengyuan, and Taifengcheng all exited, Yifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Yuanchun, Yuankangxiang, and Wanxing had confusing ins and outs. On the same day, Dalian Gang sold out a total of more than 600 bars and entered more than 40,000 bars, while Guanggang had no more than 300 bars of ins and outs. Furthermore, Jingfu sold out three or four hundred bars as soon as it opened, and the bar amount of each company was more than 23,000.</p>

<h3 id="e192">The Lira Market Remains Weak <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The lira market's volatility has been unpredictable in recent days. However, in the end, it remains on a hovering course, consistently staying around 6 mace, 8 fen, and 9 li. This is due to the shift between strong buying and selling. In times of tension, it inevitably rises, but with yesterday's weakness, it again declined. It can be seen that the current situation shows no sign of turning around. The silver loan situation remains as relaxed as ever.</p>
<p>The lira continues to fall, and loan rates are stable: [Lira] The opening lira price was 6 mace, 8 fen, 9 li, 1 hao, and 2 hu, slightly lower by 2 hao and 5 si compared to the previous day's noon market. The noon market fell by another 0.5 li, to 6 mace, 8 fen, 8 li, 6 hao, and 2 hu, for a total decrease of 7 hao and 5 si, only 2 hao and 5 si less than the previous day's opening market. [Silver Loans] The early and late markets were both at 6 fen, with an additional 2-3 fen for surcharges, slightly less than the previous day. The trend of silver funds remains in a relaxed and weak state.</p>
<p>Copper coins suddenly become especially long: Jiangsu small foreign coins, after falling by 1 li the day before yesterday, returned to the original rate of 6 qian yesterday. There were no rises or falls in the early and late markets. Transactions were 7,000 jiao in the morning market and 3,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were 5 qian, 8 fen, 2 li, and 5 hao in the morning market, and 5 qian, 8 fen, 2 li, and 1 hao and 2 hu in the afternoon market, resulting in the same price as the previous day's market. Transactions were 145,000 jiao in the morning market and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Due to the large quantity of copper coins being issued, although there were active buyers, the result was an increase of 2,500 cash, to a top rate of 432,500 cash. Transactions were also numerous, totaling over 52,700 strings.</p>
<p>Silver dollars meet reasonable demand: [Silver Funds] News of bank receipts and disbursements yesterday was mixed.

<p>Securities and Bond Prices Rise by Four to Five Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th), the bond market on the Chinese Securities Exchange saw sparse spot trading, with only 8,000 yuan transacted for the entire day. Futures trading was slightly more active than before, with a total of 4,815,000 yuan transacted in the morning and afternoon markets. Regarding the trend of bond prices, the overall situation was dull, and there were no new developments in the political situation or diplomacy. The market was still in a wait-and-see mode. Supply and demand remained balanced, and prices remained stable, with minimal fluctuations. However, due to higher demand in the market, buying slightly outweighed selling, causing prices to rise slightly compared to the previous day, by around four to five jiao. Only the Consolidation Sixth Series and Reorganization Surtax bonds showed a weaker trend.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Yarn and Cotton Market Soars <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is soaring, with a sudden tightening trend. Overseas cotton markets are jumping wildly, and market sentiment is agitated. Short sellers see favorable conditions and can only painfully cover their positions. The market is rising sharply, but the rise is not yet extremely intense, because domestic finances are not very relaxed, and the ongoing war in Jehol is deterring new buyers. However, long positions are strongly supported by American cotton.</p>
<p>People's Mark Soars by More Than Two Taels: The People's Mark opened higher, with each month rising by one tael and six, seven, eight, or nine qian due to the surge in American cotton. Speculators also bought in. The afternoon situation remained bullish, with each month rising by another two, three, four, or five qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 40,800 bales. Gengfeng sold 2,450 bales, Lichang 1,550 bales, Yuanda 1,150 bales, and Senkang 1,050 bales. Ruidai bought 2,900 bales, Xincheng 1,800 bales, Yichang 700 bales, and Yongda 800 bales.

<p>American cotton, which has been rising for several days, saw another surge today. Each month broke through the 8-fen mark. The trend is extremely strong. As a result, local buyers were greatly encouraged by American cotton, and buying sentiment was particularly enthusiastic. Short sellers painfully closed their positions, causing the market to soar. However, one major merchant still had no intention of covering his short positions. The domestic new cotton production situation is still good.</p>
<p>Zheng Mark Strongly Rises by Eight or Nine Qian: The Zheng Mark opened higher due to the surge in foreign cotton, and buying sentiment was strong, with prices rising by six, seven, or eight qian each month. The afternoon market remained good, with prices rising by another one qian each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 148,000 dan. Tianlong sold 3,300 dan, Guangfeng 4,500 dan, Yifeng 4,000 dan, Changhe 8,900 dan, Tonghe 3,200 dan, and Yuchang 2,400 dan.

<p>High Raw Cotton Prices, Sparse Transactions: Although raw cotton business has not been brisk, because those holding goods see American cotton soaring, they are asking high prices, making it difficult for both sides to reach an agreement.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton soared due to poor harvest conditions, a good cloth market, and buying by speculators. The market was firm and active, with futures rising by 47 to 50 points and spot prices rising by 50 points. British cotton futures rose by 2 to 5 points, and spot prices fell by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 24th):</p>

<p>In the South Shanghai market yesterday, not many supplies came from the mainland, about a dozen. The sales market in this street was quiet in the early morning, but became active before noon. Several hundred stones of Changshu and Xixi Beigeng rice in upper-class warehouses were priced similarly to the previous market. Early and late season rice was firm, while secondary rice was weak. Foreign Du Jian and Bianyin Yuanwei were weak and showing signs of falling.</p>
<p>About 14 or 15 rice boats carrying Changshu and Xixi clams arrived in the North Shanghai market. Transactions in urban and rural areas were not very lively. Thick-stalked rice arrivals sold flat, with no rise or fall. Thin rice was handled by visiting traders, with a starting price one chi higher. New stalk and new visitor tip arrivals sold sluggishly, and the situation returned to weakening.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Hunan Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>A Large Batch to Arrive Soon</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Remains Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice sales stalled, but this street continued to have demand. This street, along with rural villages and scattered households, sold one lot of Saigon rice with 500 bags, priced at 9.65 to 9.6 yuan, and 2,000 bags of small-grain rice, priced at 9.15 to 9.05 yuan. In addition, old small-grain rice was priced at 8.95 yuan. Yesterday, another 150 bags of Hunan rice arrived, also handled by Yu Feng, but no transactions were made due to disagreements on price. However, according to news from Hunan traders, a large batch is expected to arrive in Shanghai in the next week, about 3,000 bags. Their costs are lower, with high-quality rice around 9 yuan, and medium and secondary rice at 9 to 8.5 yuan. The continuous wind and rain yesterday suggested the possibility of a typhoon, so public sentiment had already settled down.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Flour Market Enters a Weak Trend <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, the prices for each month showed an initial stabilization followed by a weakening trend. Because foreign wheat quotations were lower by about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, the opening momentum was not firm. Later, due to factories stopping and waiting to see if outside clients would sell, there were slight purchases of near and far terms, which recovered slightly. The afternoon opening was the opposite of the morning. Initially, people's sentiment was still firm due to the good morning, but large factories continued to sell, so the market weakened again (Fook Kan Wheat No. 2 was quoted at 3 taels 8 qian 7 fen). Seeing factories continuously selling, on one hand, it was because the price of foreign wheat was fixed, and on the other hand, it was because the inventory was very large, and they had no choice but to sell it off. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, September fell by 0.05 li, October fell by 0.1 fen, November fell by 0.075 fen, December fell by 0.125 fen, and January fell by 0.1 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Futures Wheat Still Tends to Be Firm <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the futures wheat market yesterday morning and afternoon, the prices for each month generally remained bullish. Although foreign wheat quotations were lower by about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, market sentiment was that what was fixed for foreign wheat belonged to the factories, and there was no reason for the exchange to sell both flour wheat. Therefore, the position of domestic wheat remained firm. Kaitai Run bought in this month, preparing to receive goods, so it broke through the 5-qian mark again. September and October generally hovered, but the trend was still good. As a result, this month rose by 0.3 fen compared to the previous day, September and October remained unchanged, November rose by 0.3 fen, and December fell by 0.1 fen. Spot wheat was quiet due to lack of arrivals and sales, and only bales remained unopened.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Turns Stable After Falling <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Over 50,000 Bags of Dutch Red Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's trading at the Sugar Association's market remained quiet. The price of Dutch No. 24 raw white sugar turned stable after falling, with the transaction price falling to 14 taels, 3 qian, and 7.5 fen. Over a thousand bags were traded, but the output was not high. Demand was still strong, and the trend was quite promising. No. 22 medium white sugar was 14 taels, No. 8 Dutch red sugar was 10 taels, 0 qian, and 4.75 fen, slightly higher at 10 taels, 0 qian, and 5.25 fen, and No. 10 goods were 10 taels, 0 qian, and 9.75 fen. The market situation was still stable, but the arrival of over 51,000 bags by the Jianyuan Company on the "Zhisaluya" ship slightly calmed the market. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was quoted at 16 taels and 2 qian, CW Mark at 15 taels, 6 qian, and 7.5 fen, DY Mark at 15 taels, 4 qian, and 2.5 fen, H Mark at 12 taels and 4 qian. In and out were still active, and the market situation was quite stable.</p>

<p>The previous batch of Hainan longan was oversupplied, causing the market price to plummet, and the cargo owners all suffered losses. Therefore, the number of arrivals in this batch was greatly reduced, totaling only over 200 pieces. A portion of them were released yesterday, and the market price suddenly turned firm and rose. It was reported that high-quality goods opened at 25 taels, and subsequently decreased accordingly, an increase of 2 or 3 taels compared to the previous market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port negotiated with European and American firms for silk from Huangbai factories. Chinese silk merchants insisted on high prices, and transactions were difficult to complete. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and Blue, Yue, and Bi sold 40 packages of Shanghai white factory silk of upper-grade B (suitable for British sales) at 680 taels (suitable for British sales) , 30 packages of medium-grade silk of 20-22 strips at 565 taels, (suitable for French sales) and 60 packages of medium-grade silk of 83.4 average at 623 taels. (suitable for American sales) 40 packs of Chuanchang iron silk, with 13-15 stripes in the upper body, sold for 620 taels, and 20 packs of wood silk sold for 535 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Xiuning Autumn Tea Production is Scarce <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Autumn tea (namely, Autumn White Dew) is the third time the tea tree sprouts. Farmers have always been forbidden from picking it. Moreover, because the tea tree's nodes have been picked three times, the barren branches are sparse, and the growth and strength of the spring buds of the following year are weak. Those who have not picked autumn leaves are not able to develop densely. This year, tea farmers in Xiuyi are forced by economic hardship to pick and sell to tea shops any autumn branches that show slight buds. Each household produces about one or two catties per day. It is estimated that the production of autumn tea in the four rural areas of the Xiuning County has been about twenty or thirty dan in the past ten days. The price ranges from 35 yuan to 40 yuan. Tea shops find that this tea has a bright and clear quality, so they are happy to buy it. Unfortunately, the production is scarce, which is not enough to meet the needs of demand.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Zhenmei Green Tea Turns Firm and Smooth <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yihai, Jinlong, Xiehe, Tongfu, Yongxing and other firms, as well as the China Tea Company, were all actively searching for Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Shexian, Suian and other routes. The market suddenly became active, and the trading of extracted cores was particularly strong. The opening price was 160 taels, and everyone became firm in the market. In addition, special tea items such as needle eyebrows are also very popular in the market. Among them, goods with excellent leaf quality are sold immediately upon arrival, and the green tea market has shown a firm trend.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Wuyuan Tea Shops Gradually Close <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Tea shops in Wuyi County, fearing the sluggishness of the Shanghai market this year, have mainly reduced the amount of tea purchased. Except for some tea shops that closed last month, most of those that made two or three shipments have all closed about ten days ago. However, Longteng and Yu Yongxin tea shops in the northern part of the county, as foreign merchants have done business, have recently added more than 100 dan of Gan tea and started picking and manufacturing, which will not be completed until the end of next month. According to the estimates of tea shops that have sold box tea, the difference between sales and costs this year means that each dan of tea has to lose about 30 taels. For the entire Wuyi County, the total loss is at least more than 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Fine Cloth Broadcloth: French Goods are Favored</p>
<p>Recently, plain and gray-colored fine cloth has sold well. Kongshi 444 sold for 2 taels and 4 qian, Ningfeng Pengshoutu for 2 taels and 4 qian and a half, and Deji 1313 for 2 taels, 4 qian and 2.5 fen, which is a considerable improvement compared to ten days ago. Those priced at 2 taels are even more popular. French goods, such as those from the Meifa, Yongxing, and Baoduo brands, are quite favored, surpassing other British, German, and American foreign firms. It is said that besides the French foreign firms that have lower-grade broadcloth priced around 2 taels, other firms rarely supply them.</p>
<p>Hardware Factory Adds Four No. White Lead Sheet: The hardware trend is still flat, customer sales are not strong, and factory demand is stagnant, so the market seems to have stalled. Minor decorative purchases have also been very sluggish recently, so the overall situation feels even more deserted. However, the military factory business suddenly picked up yesterday. Over two hundred bundles of Four No. white lead sheets were released yesterday, and the market goods were almost completely searched out. Due to the empty Bu Xiu, it is estimated that each dan can be valued at 22 taels and 5 qian, an increase of more than 1 tael compared to before. However, the bottom storage is surprisingly dry, and if another batch is processed later, the market situation may rise again.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Like Father, Like Son <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai newspapers reported that Gu Chengyou, the son of Gu Zhenxian, the compradore of Mitsui &amp; Co., warned his father Zhenxian to resign from his position as compradore, which angered his father, leading to his expulsion and subsequent mental disorder. He was detained for buying things. The report generally stated as such. From the old perspective, this is naturally a major upheaval of ethics. From the new perspective, it is a manifestation of patriotic enthusiasm. Is it a major upheaval or enthusiasm? A clear explanation should be given. Because now is an era of unclear right and wrong, and lack of reason, the truth of everything should be clarified.</p>
<p>I do not know the inside story of Gu Chengyou's warning to his father, nor do I know the general public's evaluation. I cannot help but criticize the situation as presented by this incident and the current morbid mentality of young people in society. Gu Zhenxian worked as a compradore for a Japanese firm. After the September 18th Incident, he refused to resign. After the January 28th Incident, he still refused to resign. Gu Zhenxian was blinded by greed and willing to be a traitorous merchant. This ironclad case is undeniable.</p>
<p>But who is Chengyou? He is the son of Gu Zhenxian. The ancients said that one should gently advise one's parents. "Gently" means subtly. Now that the old etiquette has been overthrown, the word "subtly" is naturally no longer applicable. Now, Chengyou advises his father, but he does not listen. He warns him in the name of the Iron Blood Corps, but he still does not listen. Gu Zhenxian prioritizes profit and has lost all conscience. He is indeed despised by humanity. However, Chengyou and Zhenxian still have some blood relationship. Assuming that Gu Chengyou could truly renounce his father for righteousness and was unwilling to be the son of a traitorous merchant, he should publish a statement in the newspaper, sever his father-son relationship, and seek a new life on his own. This would also be a bright path.</p>
<p>Now, Chengyou goes to Wing On Company to select goods and sends them home, only to have them returned once and then sent again a second time. In Chengyou's mind, he naturally wants to mess with his family, not the company. However, the company has suffered many troubles and should settle the account with him. However, I have observed that many young people now have extravagant habits and demand things from their fathers. When their demands are not met, they borrow names and use threats. This kind of behavior happens often. I do not know what Chengyou's behavior is like on weekdays. However, I believe that Chengyou's behavior of selecting goods and sending them home is not conscious at all and does not resemble what a rational young man would do.</p>
<p>Therefore, loving the country is one thing, and messing up the family is another. It is not that the son of a traitorous merchant opposes his father, so he should be regarded as acting correctly. However, if this kind of behavior comes from the son of a traitorous merchant, it can be regarded as a kind of retribution, as the saying goes, "Like father, like son."</p>

<h3 id="e209">Wireless Electric Light <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Deer</p>
<p>[Wireless Telephone] [Wireless Telegraph], we are almost tired of hearing these names, and have seen them countless times. But [Wireless Electric Light], this fresh name, even in this scientifically advanced 20th century, is still only a dream. Now I suddenly write this strange topic, I think everyone will be surprised, or want to be suspicious, saying it's just renaming [Flashlight] [Gasoline Lamp] [Kerosene Lamp] [::::]! But what I call [Wireless Electric Light] is not what you guessed. Now let me slowly explain.</p>
<p>Originally, an electric light is a device that emits light by conducting current through two wires to a light bulb. Everyone knows this, and there's no need for me to explain it. What I call [Wireless Electric Light] is also such a device, but the current it needs is conducted from two wires so thin that they are almost invisible, almost like wireless. In essence, it is still a wired electric light, just an interesting scientific trick, or to put it bluntly, just fooling people!</p>
<p>The method is very simple. Just find an old flower wire (length doesn't matter), and carefully scrape off the gauze and rubber covering it with a small knife, being careful not to cut the copper wire inside. After scraping it clean, separate the copper wire into strands, and twist every two strands together (because a single strand is too thin and easily breaks). Do the same to make two long strands (the length depends on the distance from the power source). After twisting them, apply some glue to each strand to prevent them from splitting. Then take an ordinary large light bulb and a light socket, and a foot or so of flower wire. That's all the materials you need.</p>
<p>Just connect the two ends of one end of the flower wire to the light socket: then install the light bulb, and slowly separate the two ends of the other end in a staggered pattern, until the two ends are about three or four inches apart, so they don't touch each other: then nail them to the wall near the table, and cover the wire part with paper, so others won't notice it. Place the light bulb on the table: then connect one end of the two thin copper wires to the two ends of the other end of the short flower wire, and connect the other two ends of the thin copper wires to the current-carrying wires: (Be sure to turn off the main switch when connecting, and keep the two strands several inches apart to avoid danger). The route it passes through must be along the wall or other stable places, not suspended in the air, to prevent danger. If there are turns or damp places in the route, you can insulate them with insulators, or first use the complete rubber rings scraped from the flower wire, and put them on the thin wires, and place them separately in these places. The entire installation is now complete!</p>
<p>But you still need to carefully check if there are any improprieties. If there are none, you can turn on the switch, and the light will naturally turn on! (The brightness is comparable to a lamp powered by ordinary thick wires). If you install it very well and properly, then no one will understand your secret, unless you tell them: This kind of electric light, although wired, seems like wireless, so that's why I say [Wireless Electric Light]! Readers may say [Slippery fellow] at this point! Haha!</p>

<h3 id="e210">My Opinion on Daycare Centers <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Zu'e</p>
<p>Your proposal for [Daycare Centers] is excellent. Not hesitating about my own shallowness, I will also talk about this matter.</p>
<p>It can be said that daycare centers already have facilities in China, namely, orphanages. However, this kind of facility is entirely charitable in nature and exists within certain limits, so the aims are different, and the content is not handled properly. Many malpractices arise, so they attract little attention and are not improved.</p>
<p>Originally, the prevalence of orphanages can be said to be ubiquitous in our country. This kind of extremely good social welfare undertaking, if it can be utilized and improved, is truly a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Daycare facilities are needed when parents are engaged in social undertakings or have other entanglements and cannot attend to the task of raising children. By using a group management method, they take on an obligation – that is, giving a considerable amount of money to the daycare center – to settle the infants, so they can concentrate on their own undertakings. This method is indeed a new discovery in the new society. However, the establishment of daycare centers is difficult to realize without a sound society. Soviet Russia has a different organization and social situation, so babies there can be entrusted to the public from birth. Their orphanages are set up in factories, schools, public entertainment places, or parks. In a considerable process, they enter kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, and even university, without you having to worry about anything, because although they still have individual families in form, the focus of everyone has already shifted to the social public. However, in China, the situation is naturally different, but with the inability to balance career and parenting, the need for daycare centers is indeed urgent! In my humble opinion, the existing orphanages should be thoroughly changed and made scientific and social. I record the following suggestions for improvement:</p>
<p>The original purpose of orphanages was: to take in and raise babies who were born but could not be raised and were about to be abandoned. On the one hand, the remaining babies are provided to those who have no children to adopt. This spirit should naturally not be abandoned, but it can be renamed [Charitable Department of Daycare Center], which is dedicated to carrying out this aim. In addition, it is dedicated to raising children for others, and there must be a considerable price. For example, how much should be paid for each child entrusted to be raised each year? The center should determine it in detail, and collect a certain amount on top of the various expenses as a fund for the charitable department (or fundraising may be done separately).</p>
<p>The management method should of course be as perfect as possible. The past corruption in the management of orphanages was really unpopular. Like an unsound wet nurse, feeding many babies, or a stupid and barbaric woman, acting as a nanny, these can affect the happiness of children. Therefore, wet nurses, nannies, etc. must receive considerable education or training. Other requirements include spacious and clean housing, and large gardens and open spaces. In short, everything that is beneficial to children should be as perfect as possible (but it should not be too aristocratic! Otherwise, will it not affect the children themselves?)</p>
<p>These are my opinions on changing orphanages to daycare centers. First, it is easier to use the existing scope of orphanages to expand them. Second, the organization of the daycare center still does not abandon the original charitable nature of the orphanage, achieving two things at once, perhaps here? I hope everyone will discuss it.</p>

<h3 id="e211">The Barber's Words <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>

<p>Elementary School Teachers Lament Their Inferiority</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to get a haircut, and I asked the barber, [How much do you earn each month?] The barber said, [About forty or fifty dollars]. I was a little surprised when I heard this, so I asked him how he could earn forty or fifty dollars a month. The barber said, [On average, we can give haircuts to eleven or twelve customers a day. At two dimes per person, that's two dollars and forty cents. After a four-six split with the boss, we can earn one dollar and forty-four cents a day. Wouldn't that be more than forty dollars a month? And the boss provides the meals. But when I look at the schoolteachers, elementary school teachers earn ten or twenty dollars a month, and some middle school teachers earn only about forty dollars. And they have to pay for their own meals, which cost at least six or seven dollars. They actually earn less than us, but they have to spend a lot of capital. What capital do we have to speak of? They still often engage in infighting and make trouble. It's really not as peaceful as us. So although our position is lower, we are still in the same profession. There is no high or low in a profession, and we are also very comforted]. After listening to his words, I couldn't help but sigh lightly, what's the use of studying, why do we study, alas! Elementary school teachers are really inferior to a barber.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Whose Fault? <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Na</p>
<p>Before the summer vacation, when a certain middle school in this city was about to hold the graduation examination, a certain student gathered his usual good classmates at his home for a secret meeting. He acted as the chairman and announced the purpose of the meeting: [Now the graduation examination is coming soon. The grades of several of us friends are not very good. If we can't graduate this time, wouldn't it be very unlucky?]</p>
<p>[Yes,] Student A interjected: [Then we have no other way but to burn the midnight oil].</p>
<p>[Is there still time to burn the midnight oil?] Student B seemed to understand Student A's intention and said: [If you want to burn the midnight oil, you can go alone. I am most unwilling to burn the midnight oil].</p>
<p>[Listen to me,] Student A said with a grin: [I have an excellent method! As long as you follow my method, I guarantee that you will all graduate].</p>
<p>[What method? What method?] They all hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>[There are three school workers in the school who mimeograph the exam papers. As long as we give them some money, we can ask them to steal the exam papers in advance. Isn't this method good? About ten dollars per person is enough. A total of thirty dollars. We six people can share it. Each person only needs five dollars. Is it convenient or not?]</p>
<p>[This method is excellent!] Everyone agreed.</p>
<p>After the three school workers each put two five-dollar bills in their pockets, physics, chemistry, history: : :</p>
<p>Exam papers flew out one by one. As a result of the examination, these six friends, whose grades were usually not good, did surprisingly well this time. The principal was somewhat suspicious, and the other school workers who could not get a share became jealous after seeing the money and revealed the secret. The principal put on the airs of a lord and summoned the three school workers for a strict interrogation. They all admitted to accepting bribes and cheating. So these three poor, ignorant school workers were immediately fired under the principal's thunderous anger. But these six students, due to various relationships, were still allowed to graduate: they were still given the same graduation.</p>
<p>Whose fault is this after all? It's not the fault of the six students, nor is it the fault of the three unlucky school workers. It is really the fault of the school authorities: especially the director of moral education. The occurrence of this unfortunate event can be said to be the school having no moral education, or it can be said that the school's moral education is completely bankrupt!</p>
