<h3>武籐兼特使　元·</h3>
<p>日本承認满洲僞組織之空氣。傅布已久。一般人預料。則以爲日人雖無視國聯。然亦未必無顧忌。在國聯報告書提出以前。未必遽有此舉但日人竟不顧一切。决欲籍此問題以試騐國聯。究竟有多少力量。究、竟對日有何種决心。此所以有任武籐信義兼僞組織特使之事也。</p>
<p>據今日路透國民兩社所載日内瓦電。均謂國聯已接到日政府說明武籐兼任满洲國特使之文國民電并謂「國聯中人接文後大爲憂慮。」又謂「此間已發生痛苦印象咸覺此舉將使年來糾紛不解之中日爭執。愈形複雜而嚴重」可見國聯中。人亦已重視此問題。而感覺應付之棘手矣。日本雖聲明武籐之任特使。與尋常大使不同。並不徴僞國同意。亦不携遞國書不過爲監督僞國内之各日領。統僞國内之日本各機關。但此種掩飾歎騙之語。雖三尺童子。亦知其妄。國聯在此將提報告之時。其將付諸不聞不見。而任中日糾紛之日趨擴大耶。抑將取嚴厲之辦法以應付之耶。</p>
<p>雖然。國聯之如何應付吾人可以不問。日人所以敢以此嘗試國聯。敢以此戲弄國聯者。亦已料定國聯之無能爲力也。國聯之無能爲力。早已有種種事實證明。無怪日人玩之於股掌之上。故吾人今日不必問國聯之態度如何。而祇問我國自已。究將如何應付日本。若徒仍以一紙空文之抗議書爲應付。則前此種種抗議。何嘗有絲毫結果。蓋此次武籐之兼任特使。即所以表示正式承認僞國。承認僞國即所以表示中國對满已無說話餘地。日政府說明武籐之特使。與尋常大使不同。吾人亦深信其與尋常大使不同。不過吾人所謂與尋常大使不同者。以武籐之特使其權較尋常大使爲大。不啻爲满洲之總監。旣握軍司令與關東長官之權。又當僞國特使之任集四權於武籐一人之身。其威力自非尋常大使可比今後中日接近之機會愈遠中國對付東北問題。自必愈難。然而我中國部分人尙有以爲撤換本莊改派武籐。即表示日人誠意言和。高呼承認僞國。無非敷衍國内之人　。此後直接交涉可以有望。嗚呼。直萝　已。</p>

<p>哈瓦斯十五日日内瓦電日本政府爲任命滿洲特派全權大使一事、特以公函一件送達國聯會秘書長、已由該秘書長轉呈國聯行政院、公函内容如下「日本政府久已認爲必須設立一種適宜機關、以便將日本在滿之各種機關、予以統一、日本政府現已將各種機關、即領事·及關東廳·曁軍隊、統置於一人監督之下、惟此各機關在今以前之組織及權限、仍維持原狀、因此武籐將軍已於一九三二年八月八日、被任爲關東軍司令、同時兼任駐滿特派全權大使及關東總督、此項任命、係以一九一七年天皇勅令爲根據、武藤將軍之派赴滿洲、係爲解决必要事件、例如參照滿洲實際新狀况、以指揮監視日本在滿洲之各總領事、故不携帶國書、其任命係以一國片面之意志行之」</p>

<p>國民社十五日柏林電德官廳發表、希特勒進見總統時、不顧憲法保障、要求如墨索里尼之完全狄克推多權力後、已發生猛烈之反響、即右派之穩健報紙亦　致拒絕希氏要求、以爲至少當斥爲未到時機、如德文世界報鄭重聲稱、德國在歷史上與政治上與意國根本不同、故即就理論上言之、亦不能有墨索里尼第二、各報又咸稱、總統爲憲法故、當然拒絕希特勒過奢之要求、而希氏不顧選舉前擁護「總統内閣」之諾言、亦大爲各報所訾議、至今後政局之發展、大半繫於新國會之態度、據德文世界報載稱、倘國會議决撤消緊急命令案、總统將立即解散國會、設續選之國會仍未能供給組織穩定政府之基礎、則總統將召集國民大會修改選舉法、惟各黨對於巴本内閣之態度、目下仍在混沌之中、國家社會黨原定明後兩日召集本黨領袖及國會議員會議、今已無期展緩、</p>
<p>路透社十六日柏林電希特勒拒絕德國副總理及普邦總理職後、今日第一次對衆發言、謂余若接受興登堡總統之折中辦法、則余之徒衆將莫余諒云、希特勒深信政府之活動、將引起騷亂、渠不願披露其計劃、但謂如政府贊助國社黨之行動、而不使共產黨勢力轉强、則吾人亦贊助政府、設政府以妨碍國是爲務、則吾人必反對政府、余决不賣黨求榮、實無遷就可言云、</p>

<h3>對於全國體育會議最低希望　·郝更生·</h3>
<p>體育敎育、久爲東西保國所注意、歐戰以還、尤爲重視、蓋其爲整個敎育程序中之重要部份、有關於國家元氣及民族精神者極大、而我國歷來執政者、向不注意、今者國勢日益危弱、雖多由於政治經濟及整個敎育之未能人正軌所致、然一般人民之體力不足、精神不振、亦爲主要原因之一、今日政府於國難嚴重期中、召集全國體育會請、計劃全國體育實施方法、用意至善、惟此次會議、係我國歷史上之新事件、且其性質係爲全國公開研討者、故議案必多、而範圍亦必廣、偶一不愼、討論結果、必蹈一般會議中支支節節、本末顚倒之覆轍余以爲欲免此弊、此次會議中之議案、應大體分爲兩組、</p>
<p>（一）研究方面——關於課程·敎材·測騐·調查·及人材訓練等屬之、</p>
<p>（二）行政方面——關於設備·組織·集會·視察·及國際競賽等屬之</p>
<p>以上二則、應視爲此次會議研討之總綱、依此總綱、議案雖多、必能融會貫通、各不相擾、俾研討者得從容認識其眞價値、而將來各個議案通過後之執行、亦可循此推展、以底於成、茲更願依此總綱、一言余對於此會議之最低希望、</p>
<p>（一）由政府酌擇一二較有歷史及較有成績之學術機關或團體、指定爲全國體育研究中心、並贊助其廣羅國内外體育學者、根據現代科學於偉大歷力背景中、深刻研究並設法解决當前一切體育問題、使全國體育行政者、有所遵循、</p>
<p>（二）在政府中央行政系統下、設一全國體育行政總機關、廣延國内外體育行政人才（人數不宜多但須充分推行旣定計劃、依國内實際情况、與地方體育機關及體育、合作聯絡、根據研究者所得、推行中央所决定之計劃、果爾、則一盤散沙之國内體育、或能漸入正軌而此次會議召集之所得、最低限度亦可爲國内體育設施上、立一較有系統之基礎矣、</p>

<p>▲今後敎育當努力提倡體育</p>
<p>▲提倡體育須謀普遍的發展</p>
<p>敎育部長大會主席朱家驊致開會辭云</p>
<p>中央委員·各部長代表·各地代表·各位體育專家、今日是第一次全國體育會議在首都開會、承各位光臨、不勝榮幸、此次會議、在中國實爲創舉並曾經過許久期間之醞釀、至今日始能實現十八年七月間、西湖博覧會發起全國運動會、其時敎育部、卽擬召集全國體育會議、當時卽聘請褚民誼先生爲籌備主任、原定九月間與全國運動會先後在杭舉行嗣因全運會延期舉行、敎育部又於此時召集第二次全國敎育會議、勢難兼顧、且因褚民誼先生適赴比國參加該國獨立百年紀念召開之萬國博覧會、致未果行、國難發生國人體力欠缺之弱點、益形暴露、人人知非提倡國民體育不足以振刷民族精神、本部有鑒於此爰有第一欠全國體育會議之召集、先時擬定會員標凖、及人數、連同槪算書、提請行政院會議通過、定於今日舉行開幕典禮、所有會議規程、及籌備委員會組織大綱等、早經本部頒佈、並聘請各位籌備委員、聘任褚民誼先生爲籌備委員會主任、積極籌備、此本會議籌備成立之經過也、</p>
<p>此次會議出席會員、有國立省立與已立案之私立大學或獨立學院及中央政治學校之體育主任、有各省市敎育廳局選派之體育指導員、或公共體育塲塲長、有國省市立及已立案之私立體育專科學校校長、有中央及各省市國術館館長、有敎育部遴請之體育專家、有各部會代表、聚集行政人員與體育專家於一堂、共同提倡國民敎育、討論體育實施方案、爲劃一訓練方針、以期發育國民體格體能體力、並增進國民健康、而振刷民族精神、其意義及使命、均非常重大、此次會議討論之議案、除由敎部先期聘請吳蘊瑞·袁敦禮·郝更生三位專家、起草國民體育實施方案草案外、並收至會員提案二百餘件、將來經過全體會員縝密之討論、通過各項决議案、或由敎育部頒布實施、或移送關係機關參考、對於今後學校體育、當必有鉅大之貢獻、此爲首須向諸位報告者</p>
<p>體育在敎育上佔極重要之地位、吾人知道敎育不僅是謀知識之灌輸、現代敎育之目的、一方面爲謀個人整個機體生活之訓練、以助其生長、一方面由於個人旣有健全之機體、又能適應社會進化之要求、敎育方法、雖不止一端、其作用無非求達到上述諸位目的、近代哲學與心理學生物學之闡明、均認爲人之身心、有密切之關係、體育雖係由人體大肌肉之活動、以助身體之發育、而增其健康、然其效果、必由生理上之變動、引起心理上之變化、故體育與智育·德育·　育·美育、均有極密切之關係、今日中國敎育之通弊、一方面在不能造就生產界實用之人才、一方面尤在不能造就忠勇奮發之國民、東亞病夫之誚、至今猶不能湔雪、原因安在、不言可知、吾人努力於敎育、應認淸環境、决不可抄襲肓從、中國今日所需之敎育、一爲促進生產之敎育、一爲振掃民族精神之敎育、就振刷民族精神言、决不是單憑宣言標語、所能奏效、必定要盡量發育國民之體格·體能·體力、以造成忠勇奮發之國民、然後才能振刷民族精神、過去中國敎育上體育的成績、實在過於缺乏、學校敎育、雖有形式上的體育課程、然以人才之缺乏、經費之不充、方法之未盡妥善、對於靑年體育、貢獻甚少、至於社會敎育中之國民體育方面、更在極幼稚時期、吾人痛心國難、瞻念前途、應如何下極大之决心、掃除敎育上之積弊、開拓今後敎育之生機、實爲今日從事敎育人士所當共同努力者、</p>
<p>又有一點、提倡體育之目的、在使我國全民衆之體格體能體力、均能普遍的發展、以振刷我民族精神、惟昧者不察、僅見各地學行體育會運動會等等、惟重少數人技術之競爭、一似僅作畸形之提倡、未有普遍之含義、又以爲此少數人者、往往除體育以外、不講他學、不執他業、因此羣相懷疑、不加重視、不知我國今日學校體育、與國民體育、均未發展之時、正需要此少數人者、竭全力以赴之、如革命工作然、此少數人、卽最初之宣傅者、無犠牲决無代價、吾人逕謂此少數人、卽提倡體育期中之犠牲者可也、此次會議、社會中亦必有聞而懷疑、或竟日爲國難中不急之務者、此不能不首先對外說明者也、</p>
<p>朱家驊致開幕辭（南京光華攝）</p>
<p>此次會議、預定會期只有五日、時間異常迫促、希望各位會員、注重時間經濟、凡空泛之理論、不重要之爭執、務須力求避免、至於各位會員各位專家、遠道來臨、參加空前之盛會、敬代本部深致謝意、而如何實現本部召集此次會議之希望、將惟諸位代表諸位專家是賴、敬祝諸位共同奮鬥、</p>
<h3>褚民誼之報告</h3>
<p>▲報告籌備經過</p>
<p>籌備主任褚民誼、報告籌備經過甚詳、述大會之緣起、籌備委員會之組織、籌備之經過、及聘請專家、大會地點及招待、經費等等、已見昨報彭百川郭蓮峰所述、大同小異、不贅、</p>
<h3>中央黨部代表陳立夫之訓詞</h3>
<p>▲本民族精神融會中西體育</p>
<p>▲在適合經濟環境製成方案</p>
<p>▲用簡單的方式來發展體育</p>
<p>▲求民族生存須有體育創造</p>
<p>▲會議之結果希望切實施行</p>
<p>今天兄弟得參與盛會、非常榮幸剛才主席所說會議的意義甚詳、茲所言者、不過少許、補充意見而已、</p>
<p>聽說此次會議　除由特聘專家製成國民體育實施方案以外、計收至提案二百餘件、其中當必有許多有價値的提案在内、輓近中國學術界、有兩種矛盾現象、卽一方竭力提倡中國的國粹、反對外國的文化、他方絕竭崇拜西洋的文化、反對中國固有的東西、此兩種矛盾現象、在醫術上美術上、以及體育上表現極爲明顯二者皆非、吾人試讀中山先生遺敎、先生之致力革命、蓋爲民族求生存、國家求自由平等、對於民族自信精神之發揚、頗爲注意、民族自信者、一方妄自菲薄他方又不妄日尊大、意義殊爲偉大、中國民族之衰弱、原因固多、體育當爲其一、而知識之淺薄、道德之墮落等種種、亦有間接的影響吾人欲解决中國體育問題　不當僅於狹義方面求之　中山先生所詔示吾人者吾人當知所崇奉以解决此矛盾的現象　夫文化衝突矛盾的現象　在文化進展的歷程上　本不可避免、而如解决此矛盾現象、則責在吾人、此則擬請各位專家代表注意者也、中國素來重視體育　惟其方式、與現在所提倡者不同、吾人應當在不妄自菲薄不妄自尊大的基礎上、求其推儣、中國一切學術文化、均當於同樣基礎上求解决辦法、醫學如此　藝術如此、體育亦復如此</p>
<p>今天看見褚民誼先生的文章、褚先生是從法意太極拳運動方面立說　注重國術運動者　還請張之江先生　國術運動與體育、道並行而實不悖吾人感覺西方運動適合於團體生活　藉團體生活、發生團體運動、從團體運動中、發展其國民之德育智育、此種運動、適宜於都市生活　中國人民、多留於農村生活、享其自然之美的生活、就予個人觀察、此種經濟條件、甚關重要　譬如打網球一事、網拍一項需費六元以上、網球又需數元、至少需十數元、始可辦到、在經濟條件不能解决之下、體育僅能爲學校所專有、只能爲資產階級所享受、如何能使用具價値由昻變爲便宜、由複雜化爲簡單、使運動不爲都市所獨有而普及於農村、於平凡方式中　求體育的進步、此亦希望會議中、注意者也、</p>
<p>一個國家、一個民族能在世界上立足、必有其特異之點、吾人善於體育只知模仿不能創造、實爲一種恥辱、在中國經濟環境狀况之下　如能發明一種新的運動、以表現民族精神、極有需要、此亦希望大會注意解决者、餘之如英國的足球、美國的野球、全國風行、頗能表現其國家精神的發揚、在三民主義的中國、應如何創造新的體育運動、以發揚中國的民族精神、似頗有應注意之價値、月前中國代表在世界運動會、一敗塗地、不足爲恥、可恥者在於無創造、無發揚民族精神獨立的創造、偉大的中國人、應當創造一種運動、使國人來模仿、我們不當專門步著外國人後塵、此則民族自信之精神所表現、希望大會諸位注意者也、</p>
<p>復次、體育之事、非可徒託空言、應由知而及於行、諸位製成良好的實施方案、更宜努力推行、及於全國、求得實際的效果、此又希望於會議諸位先生者也、</p>
<p>總上所述、所代表中央希望於會議者、第一、本民族自信不妄自菲薄、不菲自尊大的精神、融會中西體育之長、在適合於中國經濟環境之下、製成一方案、第二、用平凡簡單的方式、來發展體育、第三、爲求民族的生存、必須有偉大的創造供獻於世界、建設一中華民族獨有之新的體育方案、第四、從今天以後全國體育會議所議决的結果、希望能切實行出來、</p>
<h3>國府代表何應欽演說詞</h3>
<p>▲製定普遍適合國情之方案</p>
<p>▲戒除妨害體育之惡劣習慣</p>
<p>▲製成方案須簡單而可實行</p>
<p>今天全國體育會議、兄弟代表國府來講幾句話、非常榮幸、現在世界運動大會、已在美國洛杉磯閉幕、世界所有較大的國家、均有代表到會、且各能表演其所有的特長、中國出席代表只有兩人、連决賽之　都没有、可見中國民族、素來不注重體育、達於極點、本來體育目的　固不在求得錦標、但運動爲體育之一種、有增進體力與精神力量的功用、中國古代敎育禮·樂·射·御·書·數·稱爲六藝　射卽體育之事、設爲學校以敎育之、後人不知注重　日趨退化、吾人欲求中華民族之復興、方法固多、但要從體育入手、可得而說也、</p>
<p>剛才陳先生說、中國人有兩種矛盾現象、一方保存國粹、一方素尙西洋文化、二者皆偏、希望各位代表專家、注意及此、中國國術以及外國各種運動、各有其特長、亦各有其缺點、如注重美觀、及偏重一部分之發育、各國體操、幾偏重於手指、或注重四肢、均爲缺點</p>
<p>中西體育製爲方案　此則希望於大會者、中國國技、注重個人運動、施行團體運動者殊少、融會此缺點應設法補充、使國民體育紀律化、普遍化、此種方案之製成、爲希望於諸位先生者、</p>
<p>其次爲惡習慣惡嗜好之戒除、影響於中國體育者至巨、靑年之烟酒賭等惡的習慣、務宜戒除、中國各級學校學生、不肯着短服、鄉僻女子尙有纏足者、都令女子、則不纏足而束胸、均有妨害於身體之發育、此種消極方面的禁止、亦有希望於大會之注意者、東鄰日本、在二三十年前、身軀短小、自認恥辱、爰注意於體育之提倡、惡習慣之戒除、男女學生均規定須着短服、因此其國人身長歲有增高、三十年來、平均增加一寸、此則關係、體發達、希望會議之注意者、</p>
<p>國府奠都以來　舉行之會議甚多、會議議案甚多、精神甚好、結束之高閣、全體會議此爲第一次、關係民族生存　甚爲重要、希望諸位、在　合經濟環境種種條件之下、製爲簡單可以實行之方案、方案雖好而不能實行、終歸無用、此種方案、並希望有永久性、求其議而可行、兄弟在訓練總監部、曾製定軍事敎育方案、雖經政府通令施行、而眞能實行者殊少、此次會議完畢後、如何督促鼓吹、冀其實行、希諸位注意、中國體育指導人才甚少、個人很想在中央辦一模範體育學校、諸先生亦有此提案、希望可以見諸實行、</p>
<p>今天兄弟所說的共有三點、一爲製定晋遍適合國情之體育方案、二爲妨害體育之惡習慣之戒除三爲製成簡單可行的方案、完了、</p>

<h3>行政院代表彭學沛演說詞</h3>
<p>▲中國體育日走向自殺之路</p>
<p>▲提倡須設施普遍如打麻雀</p>
<p>今天代表行政院歡迎諸位、剛才聽何敬之先生說東鄰日本人、身材矮小、世界運動會成績甚優、吾人殊覺羞恥、我謂羞恥當不僅此、更有甚者、如霍亂病之蔓延、獨盛於中國、此則中國人無體育知識之所致也、中國人天天妨害身體、天天向自殺这途去走、如需費甚少之打疫針、不肯打、而數十元之棺材到不得不買、殊可恨也、體育知識之多需講求、實爲今日當務之急、中國人出學校門、到三十歲而後、往往不注意於體育方面、陳立夫先生所說、經濟的條件、固然是一個重大原因、但無切實提倡者、亦其一因、而中國人平常不注意各種體育運動、但亦有注重者、乃麻雀運動是所以我想各種體育運動、假如有人提倡、全國體育之場所設備、能設施普遍如打麻雀者、則體育自會發達、加以有熱心體育者力行、以爲提倡、此則希望於會議諸位先生熱烈提倡者也、</p>

<h3>汪精衛偕宋子文今晨乘飛機返京</h3>
<p>汪出席中政會議後卽赴廬山</p>
<p>蔡元培表示决不就行政院院長</p>
<p>自前日中常委談話會、對汪精衛張學良之辭職、擬定解决方案後、變化迅速之政局、至此似已告一段落、汪氏並定於今晨六時、偕同宋子文乘飛機晋京、出席中政會議、報告辭職之理由、然後轉赴廬山、會晤林蔣、各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>▲訪汪之賓客汪精衛氏前夜似住於西蒲石路本宅、晨間八時二十分、鐵道部長顧孟餘由京到滬、即逕赴汪宅晤汪、九時半、中政會秘書長唐有壬亦蒞止、顧唐同於十時五十分辭去、未幾汪偕夫人陳璧君女士、乘七七　八號汽車離寓、聞係訪蔡元培氏、直至午後二時許、汪始回寓、至三時有前交通部長陳銘樞、與訓練總監李濟深來訪、談一小時、於四時一刻同辭出、旋唐有壬復至汪宅、片刻即出</p>
<p>▲汪晤蔡元培國聞社記者當汪訪蔡外出時、晤及汪氏、據其語記者謂、余此時出去係訪謁蔡子民先生、與談行政院繼任問題、請蔡出維艱鉅、余則决不復任行政院長云云、但記者嗣追踵至蔡寓、與中央研究院、則汪均未去、旋汪於晚閒始晤見蔡氏、</p>
<p>▲陳李訪汪氏昨日午後三時半、陳銘樞·李濟深·至西蒲石路訪汪、談至四時一刻、偕同偕出、國聞社記者叩陳以出洋何日、據答不去、繼曰、訪汪係普通晤談、無甚緊要、嗣轉叩李氏晋京之期、則答未定、本晚汪先生返京、余（李自稱）則不同行、陳李晤汪内容、似均不便語、記者談畢、遂分别怱怱登汽車回寓、嗣據汪宅消息、謂陳李來訪所談、僅對汪去廬山與繼任行政院人選問題、隨意談談、無甚大要云、</p>
<p>▲某中委談話關於汪回京問題、據某中委談、已經商妥、惟回復行政院長任一節、猶在磋商中、所謂修正政府組織一事、若干中委在四代大會時、本極端主張擴大行政院權限、使高於各院、俾行政院長如責任内閣性質即現行制是也、今聞若干中委近復主張縮小行政院權限回復四代大會前之組織、將政治大權完全奉諸中央政治會議、五院職權完全受政治會議之支配、如此則常委三名、汪本居一、回京仍可發展抱負、今後任何人、一度行政院長下臺、各部長不必連帶辭職、固爲一部分人員所贊同者云、至此項修改政府組織、須俟三中全會方可决定、勸駕者、昨再懇汪、暫行維持行政院務至三中全會召集時解職、並謂張學良旣已免職、主張業已貫澈、固不必再事執拗、致令政樞中斷、聞汪以本人日前文電措辭、必須關顧、並非執意擺脫政治、苟能於不違反前言限度下、當可容納各方挽留之盛意也云云、至復任院長一節、各挽駕者正在計議發一種關顧前言之措詞、俾使國人咸知汪此次一度表示辭職、實爲貫澈免張之主張、並非有其他言外意也云、</p>
<p>▲蔡元培談話新聲社記者昨訪中央研究院長蔡元培氏、作下列之談話、（問）汪先生堅辭行政院院長後、對於繼任人選、曾力推先生擔任、且聞昨日（十五日）淸晨、汪先生曾一度與先生晤談、不知先生意旨若何、（答）本人總希望汪先生能復職、余實未能擔任、（問）際此國難時期、且先生又爲衆望所歸、則先生似亦不能過嫌、（答）國難時期、固當共同努力、但亦當就各人之能力所及、努力以赴、余之不能任行政院院長、猶余之不能爲馬占山蔡廷锴之抗日相同、（問）然則汪先生堅决不回行政院長職、以先生之意見、認何人最爲適當、（答）余以宋副院長最爲適宜、蓋依法行政院之設副院長、正備行政院長不在時代行職務也、而此次若即以之遞升、駕輕就熟、此外内政部長黃紹雄亦爲極適當之一人、（問）唐有壬先生今日曾訪蔡先生、其事可得聞乎、（答）并非爲汪先生事、蓋係接洽中犬問題、因中央大學全體辭職問題、亟待於明日中央政治會議内提出解决之（問）先生何時返京、（答）尙須與楊杏佛先生續商中大問題、暫不赴京云、</p>
<p>▲顧孟餘談話鐵道部長顧孟餘、昨晚十一時、乘夜車晋京、本報記者、昨晚在車中訪晤顧氏、據談、汪先生原定今晚（即昨晚）同行入京、茲因事須明日（即今日）啓程、到京出席中政會議、報告辭職理由後、即於本星期中赴廬山、會晤林主席·蔣軍事委員長、商洽今後國家大計、但汪氏對復任行政院長、表示堅决不幹態度、至繼任人選、大約俟林蔣汪廬山會晤後、當可决定云云、</p>
<p>▲汪宋同飛京茲據可靠消息、汪精衛氏决於今晨六時、偕同宋子文乘斯可塞飛機飛京、趕往出席今晨之中政會議、斯可塞飛機、昨已修理就緒、在虹橋飛機塲停放待命云、又宋氏之私人行李及僕役等、已於昨晚夜車先行赴京、</p>
<h3>日軍越界示威市府昨向日領抗議</h3>
<p>關於日前日本陸戰隊數十名、駕鐵甲車十餘輛、至江灣體育會路一帶示威一事、業經市公安局將詳細情形、調查呈報市府、昨據秘書長兪鴻鈞表示、市府對於日軍此類舉動、已於昨日下午五時、函日領提出抗議、請日當局嗣後制止日軍越界行動、以免發生不幸事件、</p>
<h3>越界築路恊定草案問題</h3>
<p>▲工部局有商訂全權</p>
<p>▲不受領事團之干預</p>
<p>大陸報云、關於越界築路協定草案問題、大陸報記者、昨（十五）自負責任方面探得三次重要消息、（一）領事團已答復工部局收到該協定草案、並已將草案分轉各領事、據聞領事團復函内未附意見、（二）據稱領衙團見解、認該協定草案之接受與否、應由工部局决定、因該協定不牴觸洋涇浜章程、亦不變更公共租界地位、（三）協定草案之送達領事團、僅係通知作用、並非請領事團有所舉措、昨日大陸報記者曾分訪各領事、但均不顧討論此事、亦不允披露協定草案内容、僅聲稱業已接到該草案而已、按領事團内、現有數國領事不在上海、故該團苟欲聯合討論協定條文、諒亦必至下月間、但就大陸報記者昨日所得消息、加以解釋可視爲關於公共租界方面、工部局有與上海地方長官商訂越界築路協定之全權、不受領事團干預、祇須不修改洋涇浜草案可矣、且據昨日見告此項消息者表示意見、日前工部局與上海市政府協定垃圾問題時、旣毋須商諸領事團、亦不必求領事團核准、今越界築路問題、事出一律、似亦無商詢領事團或請求核准之必要、蓋上海市政府與工部局、苟爲公衆福利計、會商解决某項重要問題、則領事團曷當加以干預、據此以論、則越界築路協定草案、觀於上海市政府與工部局最近行動、而領事團方面又大致似未必加以干預、料其成立與實行之期、當不在遠云、</p>
<h3>日貨到滬仍擁</h3>
<p>▲長江日輪不收統艙船價</p>
<p>日貨來滬、邇日仍舊繼續不絕、昨日日輪笠置丸到滬、裝來日貨有一萬三千五百四十三件、内以疋頭·絲織品·橡皮品·石粉·藥料·並火柴梗原料等等爲主、另有東糖一千六百包、及紗布四百餘件、轉往漢口者、各該劣貨、均卸在上海、又有日輪生駒丸到來、亦裝到劣貨一萬餘件、亦分卸在三菱匯山兩碼頭、</p>
<p>長江日輪已半年餘無國人乘搭、日人爲謀復興營業計、主張免費乘船、此次日輪某丸由漢下水、在漢口九江等已實行統艙乘客不收船價、故第一次之乘日輪東下免費之統艙搭客、有六百餘人、</p>
<h3>金專員蒞淞就職</h3>
<p>吳淞要塞砲台、自軍政部派該部職員金之商接任保管專員後、金氏前曾一度來滬洽商接收事宜、並親赴吳淞·獅子林·二砲台視察·旋卽返京報告一切、茲悉金氏已於前日夜車來滬、卽赴淞就專員職、刻正積極整理云、</p>
<h3>戴戟已照常辦公</h3>
<p>淞滬警備局令戴戟、前因病再三呈請中央軍委會辭職、迭經懇切慰留、戴司令乃於上月底赴漢、晋謁蔣委員長面辭、又經蔣懇切面留、戴司令因蔣言詞誠摰、已允打銷辭意、業於前日起、到警備司令部、照常辦公、</p>
<h3>日外務省在滬增派大批警察</h3>
<p>▲添置普通隊特高隊</p>
<p>▲及移動隊外務警等</p>
<p>戰事終結、日兵撤退以後、在上海除增加海軍陸戰隊至二千八百名以外、又藉口上海爲國際商塲、增加保護日僑力量、從本國調大批水警官佐來滬、擴充其警察組織、而添設所謂特别高等警隊普通警隊游動警隊等種種名目、已在着手組織中、亟將詳情查誌如下、</p>
<p>▲擴充普通警隊上海日本領事署、原有日本警察一隊、現在認爲力量薄弱、由外務省特從本國調派水上警察約四十名來滬、用以編入普通警察隊内、而擴張其實力、此項普通警察、歸日本領事署警察部管轄、業經日政府外務省特調三重縣警察部長　　彌三爲上海警察部部長、統轄普警、　　已電告即日奉命來滬、</p>
<p>▲添設特高警隊日人藉口滬上爲各種思想發源地、不祥事件、時有發生、實有添立特别高等警察隊之必要、專司防查國際上之種種事件的侵入、此項特高警隊額設四十名、事務繁忙、可以增加、近三個月中、外務省已經從門司·名古屋·神户·各地調水警署官吏六七十名來滬、充任特高警察、刻已到齊、特高警察亦附設在日領署内、由領署增設警視課以管理之、特高警察每周將所得之事務、呈外務省核閱之、</p>
<p>▲增設移動警隊在特高普通兩隊以外、又復增設一種移動警察、此項移動警察範圍較大、凡自上海起至揚子江各地止、凡有事項奉派、均能前往服務、不專屬一處、而可隨時指派者、故定名曰移動警察隊、昨日已經日政府派警官吉賀雄熊·末永純行·木森兵一·本山數次·大原傅武·等由日來滬、向日領署報到、着手組織此移動警隊矣、</p>
<p>▲加派外務警察長江上游之漢口、日棰政府亦視爲重要之區、外務省因亦特派警官尾上市郎·川島榮藏·等由日來滬、轉至漢口日領事署、充任外務警察、今日離滬西上赴漢、</p>
<h3>東北救國軍電求援助</h3>
<p>▲致東北義勇軍後援會電</p>

<h3>張生哭</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>我來介紹一則西廂記借廂篇中的賓白··</p>
<p>—張生哭云：哀哀父母，生欠劬勞；欲報深恩，昊天罔極—小姐是一女子，尚思報本：望和尙慈悲，小生亦備錢五千，怎生帶一分齋，追薦我父母。······</p>
<p>西廂記已過去了，現代舞臺上搬演的是東廂記，專演些東北關廂的事。西廂記中的主角·是張生：東廂記中的主角，也是張生。西廂記中的張生會哭，東廂記中的張生也會哭。西廂記中的張生，哭在借廂以前：東廂記中的張生，哭在失廂以後。什麽呌做失廂？便是九一八失去了東廂。張生怎樣哭？張生是在招待記者席上痛哭：</p>
<p>—張生哭云：余本良心作主，已向中央辭職；此實環境所逼，本人對東—</p>
<p>北有歷史家庭名譽關係。······</p>
<p>西廂記中的張生，是假哭：東廂記中的張生，是眞哭。假哭的張生，在這一哭中，打開了西廂記的新局面；眞哭的張生，在這一哭中，結束那東廂記的舊歷史。</p>
<p>試問兩個弓長，不知那個弓長本領大？</p>

<h3>錦州一烈士</h3>
<p>— 田隅老農</p>
<p>頃接友人胡煜文君。自榆關來函。述及連山陳開方烈士。於上月二十六日在錦州城内被執。不屈殉難後。該地失一保障。以致風雲日惡。大有一發即觸之勢。關内人士。聞陳君被戕之耗。莫不失聲痛哭云云。亟筆之於左。</p>
<p>陳烈士開方。籍隸遼省連山。民十三年。以官費東渡扶桑。入軍官學校。畢業後。復以私費赴德美習實業。去歲夏間。學成返國。初擬集資開闢北滿富藏。無如卸裝未久。而九一八之事起。羣憤張學良不抵抗而坐淪三省。乃出家財。招募死士。陰以兵法部勒。君故富於軍事學識。且知實力薄弱。嘗避實就虛。襲擊僞奉山路一帶。日軍疲於奔命。損失殊鉅。故瀋變以後。日軍未敢長驅進擊山海關者。徒以連山有君搗亂故也。於是遼西一帶。綠林英豪。咸深器君之愛國熱忱。僉願拔刀相助。故君部下死士。雖祗數百人。然一旦前逢大敵不難一呼百應。榆關賴以安全。日軍因屢戰屢北。畏之如虎。乃授意僞國。遣使向君遊說。願贈日金五十萬。及大批械彈。并委君爲遼西鎭守使。君嚴詞詎絕。笑謂來使曰。余係中華昻藏男兒。萬無坐視國亡之理。雖然。我幸係坦白英雄。否則不妨佯允汝請。俟領得餉械後。再與汝輩周旋。亦未爲晚。汝可速歸覆命。看此遼吉三省。究屬誰家天下。使</p>
<h3>飛鷹艦小史</h3>
<p>— 覺民</p>
<p>飛鷹艦沉矣。飛鷹艦因内戰而炸沉矣。偶與友閒談。得其小史。錄實自由談。供憑吊者之參考焉。</p>
<p>飛鷹艦爲我國艦隊中具有悠久之歷史者。建造之初。適逢戊戌政變。康有爲駕艦出走。西太后令艦逐之。艦卽飛鷹也。故康後曾以詩紀其事。有「飛鷹追逐浪如山」之句。護法之役。程璧光率之南來。始歸粤艦隊。其後則爐敗無可復用。遂久以廢艦視之。台鮑羅庭來粤。爲聯歡民黨。斥資二十餘萬。在德購新爐。以贈粤府。粤府因亦易艦長爲俄人。而鮑則常於艦中聚黨密會。一度曾爲共黨活動之大本營。及李濟深主粤。曾乘此艦由港赴省。受熱烈之歡迎。盛况前所未有。迄今粤人猶有道及之者。今不幸竟以海陸之爭。燬於内戰之一彈。</p>
<p>者知君心如鐵石。難下說詞。肪鬱鬱辭去。嗣後君又屢次冒險。喬裝親往日軍中刺探軍情。出奇襲擊。多有所獲。上月中旬。義軍圍攻錦州。君亦與焉。卒因日軍器械銳利。久攻不克。多有退意。公奮然曰。余願率親隨數。混入城内。乘𨻶縱火。擾亂軍心。諸君可率領各軍。努力進攻。不難如願。言畢。即喬裝和服。率親隨分批混入城内。四處縱火。一時人心大亂。但城外義軍。卒不敵而退。君被擒獲。日司令一再勸降。君厲聲叱曰。我乃中華好男兒。事之不成。天也。安肯降倭奴。可速死我。乃大駡不止。卒被戕害。親隨四人。亦同殉。時在上月二十六日也。從此東北失一干之寄。而榆關風雲日亟矣。</p>
<h3>宛在水中央</h3>
<p>— 輔吉女士</p>
<p>炎署不退。樓居尤感苦悶。晨夕稍凉。外子　作漫游。顧鄉居成習。不耐煩囂。日者。電星梁賽珍女士。介予一觀游泳塲。予意城市女子。祗求裝飾。三竿日上。正酣好夢。况茲無情烈日。細皮膚一經照射。粉妝玉琢之香肌。不成醬油色者幾希。賽珍辯曰。汝所云者。豪家千金與夫蕩婦妖姬耳。新靑年首重運動。游泳—學校尙列入專科。天然之美。在乎肌肉之健康。黑白何尤哉。無多言。觀儂一試身手。於是有今晨之游焉。</p>
<p>明園。昔爲賽犬之所。途甚遙。車行約刻許。晨光　微中。凉風迎面而來。胸襟爲之大快。購券入門。徒步池邊。尙隔里許。孱體新闰初愈。不覺汗濕襟袖矣。池大兩畝。春水吹皺。由淺入深。郎澈見底浴者僅三五西人。賽珍更衣一躍。浪花四濺。不見其人。俄頃芳體漸升。嬌容含羞。宛如賜浴華淸。恐當年太眞。無此扔麗。予倚坐撑傘下。觀其忽疾忽徐。俯仰自如。時手時足。時而四肢并用。矯捷多致。西方安琪兒。豈能望其項背。忽憶鄉邨女子。力田之餘。亦嘗就沐淸流。迨觀賽珍之技。不同凡響。始知昨語之匪誑。伊又語予曰。二妹賽珠。術勝阿儂。彼能伏處池底。歷五分鐘而起。他日有緣。會當一證斯言。時日已就午。游侶漸集。賽珍樂不思蜀。外子不耐久候。促之始起。聞海上電影女明星之善游泳者甚多。曷不約來集合。各展所長。爲競爭之表演。我知其成續必有可觀者。勿謂予之好事也。</p>
<h3>提倡國片和抵制外片</h3>
<p>— ·亦周·</p>
<p>喊口號。貼標語。等到口號喊過。標語貼過。事情便算完了。現代中國人最大的毛病。就只在一張嘴一枝筆上用功夫。却不肯用雙手切切實實地去幹。</p>
<p>「提倡國產片。抵制舶來片。」這兩句話。成爲電影界唯一的中號。也成爲電影界唯一的標語。但是不幸。這口號和標語。正和普通的中號標語一樣。只是口頭上筆頭上的一種幌子。並没有實在去幹。</p>
<p>提倡國產片。和抵制舶來片。實在有相互的因果關係。就是要提倡國產片。必須抵制舶來片。要抵制舶來片。必須提倡國產片。但是如果要先把舶來片禁止入口。然後再來提倡國產片。這是萬萬可能的事。只有先把國產片的「質」來改善。使國人的心理和目光。漸漸傾向到國產片方面去。那時自會收抵制舶來片之效。</p>
<p>現在的電影界。一方面高喊着提倡國產影片。一方面儘是粗製濫造些惡劣影片。來欺騙觀衆。予觀衆以失望。那時觀衆雖有愛護國產影片熱忱。也要降到零度以下。結果爲淵毆魚。爲叢毆雀。把觀衆趕到舶來片的電影院去。所以要提倡國產影片。必須電影界切切實實地去幹。製造出幾張有價値的影片。否則徒蹈一般喊口號貼標語的故轍。實在是電影界的恥辱。</p>
<p>天一公司因近年來舶來聲片勢力的澎湃。國產無聲片。幾將淘汰。所以决心專攝有聲影片。來謀抵制。最近又費了不少心力財力。攝成一部戰事言情片「戰地二孤女」聽說這部影片的主旨·劇情·表演·佈景·光綫·發音等等。都不下於舶來片。這或許可以收到一點抵制舶來片的效力</p>
<p>我以爲要提倡國片。一方面固應注意於「質」的改善。一方面還須注意於「量」的增加。否則供不應求。抵制的效力也很微薄。所以要謀統盤計畫的提倡國片的抵制外片。實在有待於中國全電影界的努力。</p>

<p>▲伍廷芳</p>
<p>渡美求學最先。博士之名最早者。當推伍廷芳。旣歸國。爲律師於香港。香港固中土。而租於英國。故律師註册。例得英官許可。廷芳多識彼邦人。遂不勞而獲也。時淸廷競談外交。而謂之曰洋務。直督李鴻章倡導尤力。耳廷　芳名。招入叢疆。畀以交涉重任。累薦至道員。已而。奉使歐美邦。還朝。授外務部侍郎。不附權要。數歲未遷一官。乞退去。家於海上。築廬曰觀渡。有終老意。辛亥軍興。南北兩方以和議解决時局。廷芳被推爲南方總代表。力持民主共和。北代表唐紹儀爲所動。以電達項城。謂舍是則和議不諧。卒從其議。中山就臨時總統於南京。以廷芳爲長司法部。統一政府立。設稽勳局。贈廷芳以勳一位。嘉其功也。自是五年間。未預政事。而於政局起伏。間列名通電而已。項城薨。黎元洪繼承大位。易内閣。任紹儀爲外交總長。疆吏張勳倪嗣冲聯名攻訐。紹儀憤不之官。元洪念廷芳翊贊共和。功在國家。遂使繼任。其子朝樞方爲是部參事。知乃父將至。請廻避。廷芳旣抵任。謂久未聞政。老不耐煩。宜得朝樞貳部。元首許之。父子同官。傅爲美談。廷芳之舉不避親。固不讓古人也。時膺揆席者段祺瑞。政見與黃陂不洽。府院之爭彌烈。黃陂罷祺瑞。命廷芳權國務。旋退。入粤任軍政府總裁。長年茹素。自稱將活至二百餘齡。卒以羊城之變。驚悸成疾。未克長享歲月。殆天意歟。</p>

<h3>糧食薄稻漲二角</h3>
<p>▲滬南昨日各帮來源不多、本街去路有限、常錫北粳與蘇同帮價照原盤、薄稻貨稀、寗胃略動、開盤漲二角、新粳及洋杜尖無榮辱、變元陰元乏貨無市、</p>
<p>▲閘北蘇州河畔各帮到船約念餘號、城鄉交易比前市爲淡、崑山宜興米胃口寥寥、價疲二角、常錫北粳隨到隨銷、早晚稻上棧雖有、惟數目不多、形勢穩定、新粳與南市相仿、全日斛脚約一千五百石左右、</p>
<h3>湘砶米不日到申</h3>
<p>▲首批千餘包在塗中</p>
<p>▲烟台帮採辦西貢米</p>

<p>潮南米開禁、早見報載、漢口及上游一帶、早已裝去、上海洋米存底充足、市價步小、故以不劃未到、兹據湘帮消息、該地首批砶靖港米一千餘包、民裝在途中、不日到申、成本九元二三角、暫爲試銷、如通劃再裝云云、</p>
<h3>標粉始堅繼軟</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、呈初堅繼跌之象、以洋麥報價回好二三角左右、一時業外買氣、頗形暢盛、惟以各大廠家、因存底豐厚、依然逐批暢抛、尤以遠期爲更甚、因此人心遂成搖動、市氣卽步步鬆落較最高時跌二分左右、至實銷方面、日來去胃頗旺、北方諸口岸、均接續添辦、實屬熱閙、所以如廠出一停、市面當看平穩也、結果八九月份較前日跌七厘半、十十一月份跌一分半、十二月份听一分七厘半、一月份跌二分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥後市鬆落</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份尙見平穩、因洋麥報價好二三角、買賣雙方、均呈觀望市價上落無幾、迨至下午開盤、因粉市旣小、無錫帮之近期多頭回出頭頗暢、遠期月份、謠傅廠家續定洋麥兩船并因内地麥價、近見鬆動　高郵合申四錢半、無錫現貨　亦落角許、故行家頗有套出、致堅定之局、爲之衝破、現洋麥合價、在依違兩月之間、市氣頗有出人也、結果本月份較前日小四分、九十月份小五分、十一十二月份小四分、現麥因到銷寂、仍無做開云、</p>

<p>▲價格廉宜</p>
<p>金針菜今庚以收成豐盛、而出水又佳、如大興·仰花·鄉莊·衆興·徐州等菜大都色光黃亮身骨亦干、故市價無甚大上落、惟四川菜較次而已、近日以到湧供過於求、行號盤均極廉宜、號盤開十一兩半至十二兩、貨物为惡、行盤售十一兩八錢至十一兩半、次照减、陳菜開五六兩、售五兩許至六兩一二錢市象平平、</p>

<p>▲金山蝦尾前被恊記·鼎裕·新茂和·等行家、將　貨如數吸進、存入冷氣棧中、以致街上現貨、頓　缺乏狀態、市面提高、不及旬日、暴漲十兩有奇、邇聞外洋產市、亦已報漲、號貨雖有辦到、但爲數不多、求過於供、所以隨到隨通、少有存落、昨到念桶、號盤開售八十五兩、行方要手甚俏、立卽派完、觀市之緊、後盤或有再漲之勢、</p>
<p>▲金鈎尾港市九十五元、劃申核九十兩光景、昨日六箱、號盤開九十三兩半、至九十一兩、客家、候銷甚急、當由漢帮辦去、探聞後輪又有十九箱裝途、且看到時客胃如何、再分市之榮等也、</p>
<h3>五金洋行現貨紛紛售出</h3>

<h3>答復三君的幾句話（續）</h3>
<p>露絲君云，「若以爲受了人的欺侮，莫再去研究他，根本是不對的，」我以爲受了人家欺侮，就上永遠不去研究他們的學問，果然是不對的，但一面受人家侮辱壓迫，一面還要去研究他們的學問，也是不對的，至於我說稍有人心，即閘北虹口也不願意去，因爲日本所遺留殘暴的迹像，見之令人不快，而露絲君謂「我們因（恐怕不是這個因字）該天天去，時時去，使人多看這種慘酷的痕跡，得到深刻的印像，這各人的感想不同，見解不同，其實我說不願意去，果然無用，而露君說時時去，天天去，即甚而至於住在那裏、睡在那裏，恐也是徒然，</p>
<p>人</p>
<p>露絲君又謂「留學日本和各國去，應改變從前計劃」這個問題，是露君自由發表的主張，本來不必去加以非難，不過現在順便說說，我匣受外人的侮辱凌虐，這不是第一朝了，万其是受日人的欺凌更多，更問幾位出洋留學生，亦曾改變過方針麽？</p>
<p>星南君說，「若佛君的意思，在日本帝國主義積極侵略下，中國學生絕對不該赴日留學，但是鴉片之戰，英法聯軍，中法之戰，八國聯軍，這些豈不亦是帝國主義的積極侵略麽，如是不但不該赴日本，即英法等國也不該去，」不差，但是在鴉片之戰，八國聯軍入京的時候，星南君亦曾聽見或看有留學生赴英法等國乎，恐怕他們的留學，不是在該項戰爭以前，或戰爭以後罷，這一點就看的出現在國民愛國心的薄弱，更不如前，即智識界中，也是如此現像，幾像中國的國家，中國的土地，中國的同胞，不知是那一國的與我絕對不發生任何關係，國家儘管亡，我儘管去留學，</p>
<p>星南君又說「我的意思，學術是不分此疆彼域的」云云，簡單地說，就是學術無國界，也似不差，但是我要附帶一個條件，若撇開國家觀念，撇開個人廉恥，但知學術無國界，是一件很危險的事情，現在求學的時代，只知學術無國界，他日辦事時代，只知職業無國界，金錢無國界，於是漢奸可做，奸商可爲，若再進一步說，恐星南君還要置身無地，稍留餘地，不再盡言，</p>
<p>這種說話，第一個誤點，就是祗知學術，其他一切的一切都忘記了，眞不愧爲一個好學之士的口吻，難得難得，我現在再拿一個鼎鼎大名的漢奸來講，閘北漢寻胡立夫，新近不是被市公安局偵緝捉住了麽，請星南君看看胡立夫的一篇供詞，他所說的理由，比較你學術無國界，還要漂亮些麽，他說「地方不維持，要被一般江北人弄得人民不能安枕，」故他們組織的地方維持會，完全爲地方人民利益起見，請星南君想想，爲了學術，就忘記了國家，忘記了廉恥，胡立夫爲了地方，亦忘記了國家，忘記了廉恥，星南君所說的，僅僅爲個人的學問，而胡立夫所說的，倒是爲地方治安，他的題目，不是比較星南君所說稍微切實一些，遠大一些麽，爲什麽人人要呌他做漢奸呢？</p>
<p>胡立夫在兩國敵對行爲之下，去維持地方的治安，幾個留學生（是指九一八事變後的幾個留日學生休再誤會）在兩國敵對行爲之下，去把金錢報效敵國，去學他們的言語文字，這種留學生的心理，恐怕比胡立夫還要不堪問呢？</p>
<p>這種來書，本無答復的價値，不過我不明言，恐諸君之惑，始終不解，并且因此而引起從前的留日學生與未來的留日學生之誤會，故不憚盡言，爲諸君告也，倘諸君認爲現在一定可去，原是諸君的自由，我亦無權强制，不過我又要多方，告訴諸位一聲，不但是我反對現在的留東學生，即日本亦不歡迎華人去留學，請諸君不要现弄差，</p>
<p>本來我最不願意和人家打筆墨官司，因爲各人有各人的主張，我不能强人以苟同，人亦不能强我以苟同，因爲諸君要我答復，我不能不說幾句話，以後無論駡我笑我，我亦惟有以一笑置之，不屑再淘此閒氣，敬復，</p>

<h3>人造絲及其製法</h3>
<p>— 耀</p>
<p>絲本是一種天然的物品，我國產額甚豐·在輸出品中，佔極重要之位置，但近幾年來，自歐洲有人發明了人造絲以後，美國便盡力的把牠研究和改進，到今日　人造絲機成爲與眞絲一無異樣的東西，在絲織品中爲唯一的佳美原料，因此吾國的絲業并無形的衰敗了，照科學的眼光看來，將來的人造絲，質料和光燦等，一定會進步得比天然的爲佳妙，那時的天然絲，或竟至被淘汰也未可知，所以中國人的要想維持以前絲業上的威權，則非從速的研究人造絲及其製法不可，</p>
<p>人造絲的原料，是一種碳水化合物的纎維質，這種原料是一種生在植物裏的有機物質，例如棉花和蔴的細絲裏，就含有這一種碳水化合物的纎維質，在小樹木或素菜中，大部的成分也都是碳水化合物的纎維質，不道樹木同牠種植物不同些，長大了後，纎維質和木質便能聚合起來，造成樹木的硬度，而吾人不能再把牠取出，做人造絲的原料，</p>
<p>人造絲的製法，共有四種，但是在工業上製造時，其機器的設備和裝置等，很是複雜，不便在這短篇裏細述，現在祗把這幾種方法的大略步驟，和裏面所含的化學變化寫在下面，使大家可以得一些造絲方法的觀念，</p>
<p>（１）用棉花放在淡硫酸和淡硝酸中，使牠變成硝酸　纎維質，把這種硝酸纎維質，溶解在以　（Ether）及酒中，於是我們便得到一種可羅地安「（Colldlon)化學名，此物可用以作相片者，」把可羅地安置在一底有細空的器具中，用空氣的壓力來把這物質像置水粉一盤的從小空中壓出，因此絲狀的東西已出現，然後再加硫化氫鈉，到這絲狀的東西上去，使牠原有的硝酸鹽去掉，就得人造絲了，再把這種細絲拿起來，牽住了兩端，放在熱空氣中吹乾後，便可裝好了送往市塲上去，</p>
<p>（２）用棉花放在水中煑沸，經過了漂白的手續，把牠溶解在一氧化銅及氫氧化氫的溶媒中，说成一種溶液，這種溶液就是人造絲，只要把牠放在底裏有小空的器具中壓出細絲，再把牠漂白拉長和吹乾，便成人造絲，</p>
<p>（３）用木村中的纎維質，加氫氧化鈉，使成蘇打纎維質，（Sodacellulose）再加二硫化碳，及氫氧化鈉，使成溶液，然後再把牠壓成細絲之狀，至加硫化鈉，使絲中含有之硫，完全取去，而成爲純粹的纎維質之人造絲，</p>
<p>（４）用纎維質放在鹽酸及無水酸中，使成醋酸纎質，再加阿西墩（Ａcetone)使成爲溶液，然後再加相當的壓力，使成細絲，於是便成人造絲，</p>

<p>讀了振君男女平等問題，正如振君所謂「還是一個懸案，並未解决，」我們根本找不出振君文章裏的立論，幾個不着邊際的「事實」舉例，多少只不過僅於男子方面立塲的偏袒意見！照振君的意思：没有讀過洋八股的女子，是男子的奴隸，讀過洋八股的女人，是男子的玩物，姑不論振君是否别具肺腑，單以男女平等問題的本質而言，振君多少没有對此問題了了！</p>
<p>其實，男女平等問題，也無所謂解决不解决，再也肯定不出到了某一個時期才可稱解决，像振君的見解：舊女子是奴隸，摩登女子是玩物，那未老實的說：男女平等的事，永遠不會實行了—　　如果一個會寫「親愛的哥哥」，會說：「Kissme」「Iliveyou」的女子就是男子的玩物的話，那末一個會唱「妺妺我愛你」或呌着我的小綿羊的男子，豈</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>不就是女子的玩物了嗎？本來，在女子方面說起來，男子們的追逐女性，穿着挺直的服裝，梳得滑光的頭髮，痴心拜到在旗衫之下，這何嘗不是甘願做女子的玩物呢！</p>
<p>以前社會對於女子確是太不平等，「男浪女藏」就是男女不平等的顯然例子！現在呢，社會上一切權利義務是分不出男女了，事實上可說早已臻至男女平等的地步，只要我們誠心對待這問題，就是隨時隨地解决了男女平等的問題，否則，在一般還自以爲男子中心、視女人仍舊「女人總是女人」的觀念下，那末即使有着男女平等的機會，實現終究不能實現了！就像振君對於女子的批評與觀察，同樣會使男女平等問題受着阻碍！</p>
<p>男女平等，果然應由女子的自覺與自尊，但是男子們應廢棄「男子中心思想」的觀念，與及應輔助女子的自覺，及予女人以解决機會才是，萬不能在某一種的情形下，及某一部分的變態下，就單純的去責備女子呀！</p>

<h3>少奶奶的生活</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>「阿翠！快些點燈來」，睡在燦爛奪目的銅床上的王少奶奶，正好夢初醒的倦眼惺忪地這樣喊着，在喊的當兒，一張未曾戴上脂粉的假面具的油光滑膩的臉上，還帶着似醒似睡的狀態，同時一雙俏眼，和一口可桃，又眼涙鼻涕地連連打着呵欠，正表示出烟霞洞緊急恐慌的情緒。</p>
<p>「噢！來哉，奶奶，今天怎麽覺來這樣早，現在還不過一點鐘哩」，一個十五六歲的小婢，聞得她主人呌喚，曉得少奶奶要裝電了，馬上把美女榻上剛纔揩好的烟盤，掇到少奶奶的床邊，蹲下身子，去開始做她唯一的功課的扞子手工作，一時淸烟裊裊，吱吱吱，阿翠裝一筒，少婦吃一筒，經過了一個鐘頭，阿翠的本領眞大，已把躺在床上，像煞活死人的少奶奶，改造成一個精神煥發的英離了。</p>
<p>少奶奶的汽缸裏，加足了電流以後，就下落床來，做一番獻給男性看的誘惑工作，拍粉，塗脂，點口紅，一切改造手續完了，就有老媽子端上一席豐美的佳餚，雖則時已下午三時了，在人家已是將近晚餐的辰光，然而少奶奶還算第一頓的早膳呢。</p>
<p>用過這頓自以爲早的早膳後，再去躺在床上，和她最親密的殺人不見血的東西，接了數十個甜蜜蜜的吻，看了一看手表，心想張太太約在八點鐘請客，還有幾個鐘頭好等，牢牢地坐在家裏，萬分地納悶，不如來脫四圈，再去不遲，於是馬上呌阿翠去點兵調將，徴聘搭子哩。</p>
<p>不到數分鐘，李家太太，何家小姐，ＸＸＸ，都應召而來，室中寂寞的空氣，突然打破，一時燕語鶑啼，熱閙非凡，少奶奶和諸位閑談了一回，就傾出一百三十六隻來，實行敵對行動。</p>
<p>四圈戰罷，辰光不早，不奶奶急急地跑到房裏，再行修刷了番，出來跳上包車，呌阿毛用力快快拉到張公館去，到時張太太已等候多時，一見就說，「貴忙啊！我們等候你多時了」，她聽了笑嘻嘻地道，「我因爲你們請客，不得不到，所以今天祗有打得四圈牌就走，今夜ＸＸ戲院，映的ＸＸ影片，好看非凡，我也爲了你們而犠牲了」。</p>
<p>原來張太太的請客，是醉翁之意，目的是聯絡賭友而設，所以等到酒席一散，太太，小姐，少奶奶，就趨攙來，牌九啊，麻雀啊，直到東方發白，張公館裏的賭局方散。</p>
<p>一條晨光熹微的ＸＸ路上，還帶着些迷濛的狀態，這時張公館的門前，跑出一位少婦，跳上門口的包車，由一個正在打盹的車夫，像失魂似的拼命地拉，向前狂奔。</p>

<h3>Muto Appointed Special Envoy</h3>
<p>The air of Japanese recognition of the puppet organization of Manchuria has been spreading for a long time. The general public expected that even though the Japanese disregarded the League of Nations, they would still have some reservations. They believed that they would not take this action before the League of Nations report was submitted. However, the Japanese disregarded everything and decided to use this issue to test how much power the League of Nations actually had and what kind of resolution it had towards Japan. This is why they appointed Muto Nobuyoshi as the special envoy to the puppet organization.</p>
<p>According to today's Reuters and Kuo Min News Agency dispatches from Geneva, both stated that the League of Nations had received a document from the Japanese government explaining Muto's concurrent appointment as special envoy to Manchukuo. The Kuo Min News Agency also stated that "People in the League of Nations were greatly worried after receiving the document." It also said, "A painful impression has arisen here, and it is felt that this move will make the unresolved Sino-Japanese dispute over the years more complicated and serious." It can be seen that people in the League of Nations have also paid attention to this issue and feel that it is difficult to deal with. Although Japan has stated that Muto's appointment as special envoy is different from ordinary ambassadors, that it does not require the consent of the puppet state, and that he will not present credentials, but only supervise the various Japanese consulates and control the various Japanese institutions in the puppet state, even a child knows that such deceptive words are nonsense. At the time when the League of Nations is about to submit its report, will it ignore this or take severe measures to deal with it, or will it allow the Sino-Japanese dispute to escalate?</p>
<p>However, we can ignore how the League of Nations will deal with it. The fact that the Japanese dare to use this to test the League of Nations and dare to play with the League of Nations shows that they have already determined that the League of Nations is incapable of doing anything. The League of Nations' inability to do anything has long been proven by various facts. It is no wonder that the Japanese are playing with it in their hands. Therefore, we do not need to ask about the attitude of the League of Nations today, but only ask ourselves how we will deal with Japan. If we still deal with it with a mere piece of empty protest, then how much result have the previous protests had? Muto's concurrent appointment as special envoy is to show formal recognition of the puppet state. Recognition of the puppet state is to show that China has no room to speak about Manchuria. The Japanese government explains that Muto's special envoy is different from ordinary ambassadors. We also firmly believe that it is different from ordinary ambassadors. However, what we call different from ordinary ambassadors is that Muto's special envoy has greater power than ordinary ambassadors. He is no less than the governor-general of Manchuria. He holds the powers of the commander of the army and the governor of Kwantung, and also serves as the special envoy to the puppet state. With four powers concentrated in Muto alone, his power is not comparable to that of ordinary ambassadors. In the future, the opportunities for Sino-Japanese rapprochement will be more distant, and it will inevitably be more difficult for China to deal with the Northeast issue. However, some people in China still believe that the replacement of Honjo with Muto indicates Japan's sincerity in making peace, and that shouting for recognition of the puppet state is nothing more than perfunctory to the people in the country. After this, direct negotiations can be hoped for. Alas, they are truly deluded.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Dismissal Order Issued</h3>
<p>Zhang Convenes Generals for Talks, Unable to Leave Beiping in the Short Term</p>
<p>After Chiang Arrives in Xun, Wang Also Plans to Go to Guling for Important Meeting</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The National Government issued Order No. 16. Zhang Xueliang, Director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, submitted his resignation with sincere words. Zhang Xueliang is granted permission to resign from his post. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, Zhang Xueliang convened generals for talks at the Prince Shuncheng Mansion. More than a dozen people attended, including Fu Zuoyi, Xu Yongchang, Yu Xuezhong, and Wan Fulin. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the evening of the 16th, Zhang Xueliang invited Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, Zhang Xun, Yu Xuezhong, and Wan Fulin to talk at the Prince Shuncheng Mansion. He will not be able to leave Beiping for other places in the short term, but Tang Guozhen has been instructed to arrange for personnel to prepare the Paiyun Hall in Wanshoushan. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang was at Wanshoushan on the evening of the 16th with Zhang and other important figures staying in Beiping, as well as the generals of Shang and others. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen went to Xishan for rest this morning and will return to Beiping on the 18th. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It was learned from reliable sources this morning that Zhang Xueliang has decided to leave Beiping as soon as possible. The Central Executive Committee approved his resignation to make him eager to go to other places. The rumors that he went to Xishan a few days ago and returned to his residence in the British Concession in Tianjin are no longer a problem. What he wants is to pack up and go abroad. Initially, Zhang intended to go to France with the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to France, Dr. Wellington Koo, and then follow Koo to Geneva. Now, because Koo's departure is hasty, it cannot become a reality. Zhang now needs to hand over all official affairs to the newly formed Military Affairs Branch Committee. According to Zhang himself, he intends to complete the handover as soon as possible. After the handover is completed, he still needs to settle personal affairs in Beiping. After all matters are settled, he plans to go abroad, first to France to settle his family, and then to travel and inspect military affairs and politics in Britain, Germany, and Russia. He also hopes to study at Oxford or Cambridge. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding Zhang Xueliang's handover, there are no signs of special plans being implemented, except for minor precautions at the stations. It is generally believed that Zhang's handover can be completed smoothly. Zhang has repeatedly instructed his subordinates to obey the Central Government and not to cause any conflict due to the handover issue. Now, Chinese and foreign people all believe that this kind of conflict will not occur, because most of the members of the Military Affairs Branch Committee are Zhang's former subordinates, and two of the three standing committee members are his confidants. According to a dispatch from Hankou, Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Committee may come to Beiping by plane after the Chairman of the Military Affairs Branch Committee is appointed to convene a special meeting of officers from North China.

<h3>Chiang, Wang, and Lin Will Meet in Lu Mountain</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Chiang arrived in Xun at noon on the 15th and went to Lu Mountain to meet with Lin Sen to discuss Zhang and Wang's resignation and important central issues. According to political circles, Chiang and Lin will go to Nanjing to resolve everything. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Is Scheduled to Enter Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 16th. According to him, the Central Government has approved Zhang's resignation, and Wang is determined to enter Nanjing on the 17th to report the truth about his resignation to the Central Government. Wang's motive for resigning is to promote the development of the current situation and is by no means a personal issue. Furthermore, he has been responsible for the central government for almost half a year and has made little contribution, so he feels guilty. Therefore, he will not resume his position as the President of the Executive Yuan. When Yu was in Shanghai, Wang visited Mr. Cai Yuanpei and asked him to head the Executive Yuan. Mr. Cai expressed his modesty. Wang will visit him again today, and this matter may be realized. It is widely rumored that Vice President Song will act as the agent, but there are still difficulties in fact. While Wang and Cai are in Shanghai, acting as an agent can still be said, but Mr. Wang is a person who is brave to take responsibility. After resigning from the Executive Yuan, he must come to Nanjing to preside over the Central Political Committee and cannot hold a vain title and take responsibility. At present, the major plan is to determine the successor as soon as possible. Wang came for the national crisis of resisting Japan and is still responsible to the country and will never give up any of it. The Executive Yuan is now a responsible cabinet system, and the heads of various ministries advance and retreat together. In order to facilitate the exercise of the powers of the new President, the Central Government will of course approve the general resignation. Who will leave and who will stay will be reorganized by the new President. The urgent issue will have concrete progress when he arrives in Nanjing tomorrow. Lin and Chiang sent a telegram earlier inviting Wang to go to Lu Mountain for talks. Whether Wang will go immediately will be decided after arriving in Nanjing. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>The Central Government Will Persuade Wang to Stay to the End</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin: The Central Government has decided to persuade Wang to stay to the end because it is a time of national crisis and the central government cannot be easily moved. Mr. Wang may be persuaded to stay because of the many people who support him. Wang is scheduled to take a plane to Nanjing on the morning of the 17th. All issues will be discussed and decided after Wang arrives. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Wang Zhuzhai, chairman of the Zhejiang Federation of Commerce, and others sent a telegram to the National Government on the 16th, requesting that it promptly and sincerely persuade Premier Wang Jingwei to stay and order the heads of various ministries to return to Nanjing together to discuss national affairs to save the country. They also sent a telegram to Premier Wang in Shanghai, asking him to dismiss his resignation. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>

At noon, one plane flew to the east corner of Yuguan City, inspected it, and left. Yuguan was still peaceful a week ago. Recently, Japanese military police have been active, and the puppet police are also relying on their power to bully people, parading flags in the streets and beating our military police. After negotiations, they denied it with excuses. They also relied on Japanese military force to guide the rebellious postal workers to force our post office to receive mail from outside the pass and invited the post office director away and threatened him severely before releasing him after a long time. Afterwards, the post office telegraphed the Tianjin Management Bureau, which forwarded it to the Ministry for instructions.

<h3>Japanese Protest Against Dismissal of Fukumoto, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Refutes with Reason</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of the Japanese seizing Dalian Customs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged two protests. The Japanese response stated that the Chinese government's dismissal of Fukumoto was not notified to the Japanese authorities in Manchuria in advance, which was considered a violation of the Dalian Customs Agreement. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that since the establishment of the Dalian Customs Agreement, the Customs Commissioner of the Customs has been replaced three times, and the Chinese government followed the precedent of notifying the Japanese side after the dismissal order was issued, without any objection. This time, China has no obligation to notify in advance of Fukumoto's dismissal. The Japanese government's interpretation of the agreement lacks reason. It has been refuted with reason, and it has been stated that Dalian is a Japanese concession, and the Japanese government has a full obligation to protect the integrity of Dalian Customs. Now, it is using insufficient reasons to forcibly occupy customs affairs and intercept</p>

<h3>Chiang Stipulates Guidelines for Accusing Officials</h3>

Therefore, a Supervisory Office has been established in the Party and Government Committee to handle accusations.

If there are officials who neglect their duties, are corrupt, or defy the law, they should make true statements based on their conscience. We should humbly accept them and enforce the law. However, while officials who are derelict in their duties should be severely punished, the practice of making false accusations based on grievances should not be encouraged. In order to eliminate malpractices, we have specifically stipulated the guidelines for accusing officials, and the people should be fully informed. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Harbin Flood Submerges Two Electrical Plants</h3>
<p>(Harbin) (Delayed Arrival) Railway workers and Japanese military engineering teams are now working hard to repair the roadbed 32 miles south of Harbin that was destroyed by the water. At the same time, motor boats and cargo ships are used to transport passengers and goods to and from the area to maintain railway traffic.

(Reuters dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) (Delayed Arrival) The water level in Brister, a suburb of Harbin, has dropped slightly today, but the situation is still very dangerous.

However, the Chinese Electric Company is still working as usual, but it is also in danger of being submerged. The Railway Bureau is now using trains to transport stones to repair the bridge piers here. The danger of Harbin's territory continuing to be washed away by the flood seems to have been slightly reduced. The disaster situation here is indescribable. Tens of thousands of refugees are gathered everywhere. Schools and temples are already overcrowded. Temporary tents and empty cars are also insufficient.

There are still thousands of people in places such as Nagalovga and Chenghe who do not want to abandon their homes and are living on rooftops or high pavilions. Many of them have livestock, but they have no food or drink. Residents of Brister are also crowded upstairs. International organizations are now trying to provide disaster relief and raise funds. Everyone expects that even if the situation improves, the train south of Harbin will not be able to reopen for at least half a month. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<h3>Japan Sends a Note to the League of Nations Stating the Dispatch of a Special Envoy to Manchuria</h3>
<p>Unified Authority and Supervision of Consuls in Manchuria</p>
<p>Not Carrying Credentials, Acting with Unilateral Will</p>
<p>The League of Nations in Geneva Feels a Painful Impression</p>
<p>Geneva, 15th (Havas) The Japanese government has sent a formal letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations regarding the appointment of a plenipotentiary ambassador to Manchuria. The Secretary-General has forwarded it to the Council of the League of Nations. The letter reads as follows: "The Japanese government has long recognized the necessity to establish a suitable mechanism to unify the various Japanese institutions in Manchuria. The Japanese government has now placed various institutions, namely, consuls, the Kwantung Leased Territory, and the military, under the supervision of one person. However, the organization and authority of these institutions remain unchanged. Therefore, General Muto was appointed Commander of the Kwantung Army on August 8, 1932, and concurrently serves as Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Manchuria and Governor-General of Kwantung. This appointment is based on the Imperial Edict of 1917. General Muto's dispatch to Manchuria is to resolve necessary matters, such as directing and supervising the Japanese consuls in Manchuria, taking into account the new situation in Manchuria. Therefore, he does not carry credentials, and his appointment is made by the unilateral will of a country."</p>
<p>Geneva, 15th (Reuters) Secretary-General Drummond of the League of Nations has received a document from the Japanese government explaining the appointment of Muto as the chief director of Japanese affairs in the three eastern provinces, concurrently the commander of the Japanese army, the governor of Kwantung, and the special envoy to "Manchukuo." It states that Muto is different from the usual so-called ambassador because his appointment was not solicited from the "Manchukuo" government and he does not carry the credentials required of a regular ambassador. Muto's trip to the three eastern provinces is solely to supervise the Japanese consuls in "Manchukuo." This document has been copied and sent to all directors of the Administrative Council and member states for review.</p>
<p>Geneva, 15th (Guomin News Agency) After the Japanese government notified the Secretariat of the League of Nations of the dispatch of General Muto as the plenipotentiary envoy to Manchuria, people in the League of Nations are greatly concerned today. Although the Japanese document explains the necessity of unifying various Japanese institutions in Manchuria under the leadership of one person, the Japanese government's hasty appointment of this position before the League of Nations investigation team submits its investigation report has caused a painful impression here. It is generally felt that this move will further complicate and seriously exacerbate the year-long entanglement of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Therefore, after receiving the Japanese official document, the Secretariat of the League of Nations immediately distributed it to all member states of the League of Nations.</p>

<h3>Japan's Plan to Annex the Northeast</h3>
<p>Enters the Second Stage</p>
<p>Signing Treaties with Puppet Organizations</p>
<p>Monopolizing Industries and Controlling Governance</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (China News Agency) The Japanese government's policy of aggression in the three eastern provinces has entered the second stage. Ding Jiansu's visit to Japan, Komai's return to China, the posting of Foreign Secretary Kurihara to Changchun, and the comings and goings of General Yoshida and Yosuke Matsuoka are all for deciding on the second stage of the aggression plan. The main focus is on recognizing the puppet state and signing treaties with the puppet state. The Japanese government intends to divide the treaties into two types: one is the Japan-Manchukuo Industrial Control Agreement, and the other is the Treaty of Commerce and Amity. The purpose of the Industrial Control Agreement is to monopolize various industries in the three eastern provinces. Its main points are as follows: (1) Various enterprises in the three eastern provinces, especially industry and mining, will be promoted to the extent that they do not suppress Japanese industry and mining, but must be regulated by the Japanese government. (2) The relationship between production and consumption must be coordinated with the overall economic situation of Japan. (3) The puppet state of Manchukuo must be a raw material country, with the aim of supplying raw materials for Japanese industry, and promoting agricultural products needed by Japanese industry, such as promoting cotton planting and rejecting American cotton and Indian cotton. (4) The sales of the puppet state's industries should target the world market and should not be transported to Japan to compete with Japanese industry. In addition to the fact that agriculture, industry, mining, transportation, etc., must be subject to the control of the Japanese government, all financial institutions and industrial facilities of the puppet state of Manchukuo must be subject to the control of the Japanese government. Japan and Manchukuo are completely one economic unit. The principles of the Treaty of Commerce and Amity are as follows: (1) "Exchange of Ambassadors": After Japan recognizes the puppet state, Japan will send an ambassador to Changchun, and the puppet state will send an ambassador to Tokyo, Japan. However, the puppet state is not allowed to send consuls-general or consuls to Japan, which shows its intention. (2) "Tariff Issues": Japan and the puppet state will sign preferential treaties in parallel with the Industrial Control Agreement. Japan alone will obtain benefits, exclude the principle of equal opportunity, and desperately defend special interests. (3) "Extraterritoriality": The treaty clearly states the time of abolition, or that higher courts will be established in Harbin, Qiqihar, Shenyang, and Changchun, with Japanese people appointed as judges, as a condition for recognizing the abolition of extraterritoriality, that is, establishing Japanese courts. However, separate prisons must be established for the exclusive use of Japanese people. The so-called waiting for preparations to be completed before recognizing the independence of the puppet state by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military is intended to complete the drafting of these two types of treaties. The actions of Matsuoka and Yoshida after returning to China are very noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Yosuke Matsuoka Returns to Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Dentsu News Agency) Member of Parliament Yosuke Matsuoka will attend the League of Nations this autumn as the representative of the Japanese Empire. Therefore, after inspecting various places in Manchuria, he arrived at Tokyo Station at 10:00 AM today and returned to Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Komai and Yamaoka Head to Manchuria Together</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (China News Agency) The puppet chief of the puppet state of Manchukuo, Tokuzo Komai, is heading to Osaka tonight. In the car, he said that the puppet state welcomes Japanese capitalists to invest. In mid-September, a special envoy will be sent to European and American countries to lobby and persuade countries to recognize the puppet organization and invest in the puppet state.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Dentsu News Agency) Former Kwantung Governor Yamaoka left Tokyo Station at 9:30 PM this afternoon to go to Manchuria.</p>
<h3>Dispatching Experts to Investigate Resources</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (China News Agency) The Japanese government has decided to send a Manchuria-Mongolia Resources Investigation Team to various places in the three eastern provinces to investigate our country's various resources as a basis for new businesses. The first group is scheduled to depart at the end of the month. The team is composed of scientists, industrialists, and agricultural experts, and the Kwantung Army will send guards to protect them.</p>

<h3>Britain and Autonomous Territories Establish Reciprocal Agreements</h3>
<p>Progress at the Ottawa Conference</p>
<p>Ottawa, 15th (Reuters) The British Imperial Economic Conference made great progress today. Representatives from Britain and the autonomous territories have reached agreements on reciprocal preferential treatment between sister countries. It is reported that the agreements will be valid for five years.</p>
<p>Ottawa, 15th (Guomin News Agency) Conservative Party leader Baldwin delivered a speech today, promising that Britain would not take any actions that would harm world trade. This is the first public speech by a delegate since the opening of the Imperial Conference.</p>
<h3>German Storm Troopers Hide</h3>
<p>Hitler is Obsessed with Dictatorship</p>
<p>Causing Criticism from All Sides</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Reuters) The whole country is watching to see what steps Hitler, the leader of the National Socialist Party, who sees himself as the Mussolini of Germany, will take next, but his intentions are still unknown. What is considered strange by the general public is that the Storm Troopers of the National Socialist Party are no longer seen on the streets of Berlin and other places. Rumor has it that the commander of the Storm Troopers has granted the members a week's vacation, but the headquarters of the National Socialist Party does not acknowledge this. Berlin and all parts of the country are now quiet.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Guomin News Agency) German officials announced that when Hitler met with the President, he disregarded the constitutional guarantees and demanded the full dictatorial power of Mussolini, which has caused a violent backlash. Even the moderate newspapers of the right wing have unanimously rejected Hitler's demands, believing that at least it should be condemned as untimely. For example, the Deutsche Weltwirtschafts-Zeitung solemnly stated that Germany is fundamentally different from Italy in history and politics, so even theoretically, there cannot be a second Mussolini. The newspapers also generally stated that the President, for the sake of the Constitution, naturally rejected Hitler's excessive demands, and that Hitler disregarded his promise to support the "Presidential Cabinet" before the election was also greatly criticized by the newspapers. The future development of the political situation largely depends on the attitude of the new parliament. According to the Deutsche Weltwirtschafts-Zeitung, if the parliament resolves to revoke the emergency decree, the President will immediately dissolve the parliament. If the newly elected parliament still fails to provide a basis for organizing a stable government, the President will convene a national assembly to amend the election law. However, the attitude of the various parties towards the Papen cabinet is still in a state of chaos. The National Socialist Party originally planned to convene a meeting of party leaders and parliamentarians in the next two days, but it has now been postponed indefinitely.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Reuters) Hitler, after refusing the positions of German Vice-Chancellor and Prussian Prime Minister, spoke to the public for the first time today, saying that if he accepted President Hindenburg's compromise plan, his followers would not understand him. Hitler firmly believes that the government's actions will cause unrest. He is unwilling to disclose his plans, but said that if the government supports the actions of the National Socialist Party and does not allow the communist forces to become stronger, then "we will also support the government. If the government is engaged in obstructing national affairs, then we will definitely oppose the government. I will never sell my party for glory, and there is no room for compromise."</p>
<h3>Britain's Debt Exchange Plan Succeeds</h3>
<p>London, 16th (Reuters) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain said that the results of the war debt exchange far exceeded his expectations, which shows the patriotism and common sense of the British people and can excite the world. This morning, the newspapers were very pleased with this success, saying that the amount of new bonds exchanged is amazing, and this is the largest financial transaction in the world. They also generally said that the Ministry of Finance's measures were appropriate, and the investors made sacrifices. The authorities initially expected the total amount of the exchange to be a maximum of £1,700,000,000, but it has now exceeded this amount, and the number of requests for repayment of principal is very small, which is also unexpected. The government will no longer have to worry about giving cash. It is expected that this news will increase Britain's credit at home and abroad, thicken Britain's funds, boost the country's industry, reduce interest rates, and save Britain £23 million annually in interest on debt repayment. After the Ministry of Finance launched the war debt exchange plan, it banned the issuance of any new bonds. It is now expected that this ban will be lifted soon.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) The British war debt exchange plan, according to a report from the Ministry of Finance today, has been a great success. Officials announced that the total amount of 5% war bonds is £2,086,000,000, and the amount of 3.5% new bonds that have been exchanged has reached £1,850,000,000. Bondholders can request repayment of principal, but the total number of these requests is currently only £48,000,000. Those who have neither requested repayment nor exchanged new bonds will naturally exchange new bonds at the end of September. It is expected that those who are willing to receive the principal would have requested repayment by now, so most of the remaining war bonds will also be exchanged for new bonds.</p>
<h3>US Silk Sales Suddenly Become Active</h3>
<p>Signs of Economic Recovery in Europe</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Guomin News Agency) According to news from the United States, the economic depression is already turning around, and the first sign of this is the resurgence of the US silk industry. The US silk industry has been extremely depressed for the past two years, but recently it has suddenly received many foreign orders. This matter has attracted the attention of economic circles in Germany, because the recovery of the US economic situation has a great impact on Europe, and especially a direct relationship with Germany. Germany may therefore be able to overcome its current difficulties, so the government is planning a new economic construction plan.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Arms Case Arises from Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>Madrid, 16th (Guomin News Agency) Regarding the case of the Portuguese customs seizing three boxes of arms being shipped to the Spanish embassy a few days ago, according to officials, the arms were indeed samples requested by the Portuguese government's arms committee, and the Spanish ambassador and the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs acted as intermediaries. The whole case arose from a misunderstanding by the Portuguese customs.</p>
<h3>Chinese Experts Investigate US Mining Industry</h3>
<p>Salt Lake City, 15th (Guomin News Agency) Chinese nationals Mr. Geng (transliteration) and Mr. Zhang have recently come here to investigate the mines throughout Utah. It is said that they are all Chinese mining and metallurgy experts sent to the United States by the government to study.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Lindbergh Gives Birth to a Son</h3>

<h3>Current Situation in Rehe</h3>
<p>Tang Yulin Orders Arrests of National Salvation Army</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Scatter Flyers Criticizing the Central Government</p>
<p>Officials Throughout the Province Openly Trade in Opium</p>
<p>A dispatch from Lingnan states: Since the Japanese army invaded Rehe, the situation there has been of great concern to the nation. A reporter left Beijing on the 22nd of last month, arrived in Tianjin on the 24th, and on the 26th traveled by military vehicle to Beidaihe. There, they switched to land transport to enter Rehe and inspect the situation. More than thirty people traveled together, covering about eighty li each day, climbing mountains, wading through water, and crossing rivers more than ten times daily. The only food available along the way was sorghum, millet, and scallions, with no other vegetables. The hardships were indescribable. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the first of this month, when they were only thirty li away from Lingnan, they encountered the so-called Director of the Lingnan Administration (essentially equivalent to a county magistrate) on the road. He was accompanied by a cavalry of over a hundred men, his imposing presence no less than that of a commander-in-chief on inspection. With an intimidating demeanor, he immediately detained the group. After searching their luggage thoroughly, he discovered members of the National Salvation Army among them and arrested the group, taking them to Lingnan (i.e., Niuyingzi) and holding them in the government office. Fortunately, local residents interceded on their behalf, and they were allowed to be escorted out of the territory. Otherwise, they would have been sent to the Rehe provincial government for punishment, as Tang Yulin had ordered the arrest of the National Salvation Army and volunteer troops last month while secretly flirting with the Japanese and rebels. At 9:15 AM on the second, two Japanese planes flew from the east of the Shui River to Lingnan, circling in the air for several weeks and scattering Liaoxi Bulletins. The content mainly criticized the central government and Zhang Xueliang, and urged the people of Rehe to obey the puppet organization of the Northeast. The two planes then flew west towards Lingyuan County. This was the second time Japanese planes had come to Lingnan. The day happened to be the first day of the seventh lunar month, a market day in Lingnan, and the city was unusually crowded. Suddenly, upon hearing that Japanese planes were coming, the crowd panicked and fled in all directions. After the planes left, things gradually returned to normal. Moreover, the reporter only stayed in Lingnan for two days and nights, as the so-called Director of the Administration wanted to send them out of the territory immediately. Therefore, various situations could not be examined in detail. However, the reporter witnessed the people of Lingnan and along the way living in dire straits with nowhere to voice their grievances, revealing the depth of the political darkness. According to a staff member of the Lingnan County office, official positions are openly bought and sold. Throughout the province, regardless of rank, officials are bribed with money. Each county magistrate must pay at least thirty thousand yuan to take office. The current Director of the Lingnan Administration is no less than a petty emperor, exercising power and committing all kinds of evil. The reason he can do as he pleases is that he paid two hundred thousand yuan to obtain this position. The reporter countered by asking the staff member whether he would lose money if he were dismissed after six months. The reply was that six months would be enough to recoup the investment, and a year would double the profit. The possibility of being dismissed was an overestimation. Even heads of sections and public security chiefs in each county, as well as tax collectors, all bought their positions with money. After obtaining their posts, they arbitrarily levied exorbitant taxes, enriching themselves and enjoying a lifetime of luxury. As for the scourge of opium, it is openly traded throughout Rehe province. Military personnel and government offices force people to grow opium poppies, levying a tax of ten yuan per mu. There are also special officials who collect the taxes, and the agency is called the "Anti-Opium Beautification Bureau." Over ninety percent of the people smoke opium, even children as young as ten are addicted. When guests arrive, they are immediately offered opium, just as tea is offered in the South. These situations are enough to reveal the state of affairs. As for resistance against Japan and national crisis, current military personnel in Rehe province, from Tang Yulin down to the soldiers, and all officials, probably have never had such a concept. This is truly lamentable. (August 2nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plot to Annex Hebei</h3>
<p>First Incorporate Counties East of the Luan River into the Puppet Organization's Territory. A dispatch from Dalian, according to sources at the Governor-General's Office of the Kwantung Leased Territory, the Japanese military has decided to incorporate counties east of the Luan River in Hebei Province into the so-called puppet state of Manchuria. The plan involves using the names of gentry and merchants from counties east of the Luan River who reside in various parts of Manchuria to petition the puppet state's authorities to merge the area into the puppet state's territory. The Japanese military can then use this as a pretext to send troops into the Guannei to take over the counties. If this plan proceeds without obstruction, it can be gradually applied to the entire province of Hebei. According to the Dalian Manchuria Newspaper, established by the Japanese on the 7th of this month, the Japanese have already publicly admitted this annexation plan. The original text is as follows: Most of the influential gentry and merchants in Manchuria are from the Luan River basin inside Guannei. Since the establishment of the State of Manchuria, they have wanted to incorporate the land east of the Luan River into the territory of the State of Manchuria. Currently, there are concrete plans being discussed among Manchurian gentry and merchants, as well as other influential people from the area. It is reported that all the people east of the Luan River will issue a declaration of independence in the coming days, and at the same time request to merge with Manchuria. The Manchurian side appears willing to agree. According to reliable intelligence, certain warlords are also in communication with this effort, and someone will launch an uprising inside Guannei around that time.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Sends Bao Wenwei to Meet Chiang</h3>
<p>▲Reporting on Military and Political Affairs in North China and Seeking Instructions. A dispatch from Hankou states that after both Wang Zhaoming and Zhang Xueliang successively tendered their resignations, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, stationed in Hanyang, telegraphed Wang to urge him to stay and jointly maintain the difficult situation. He instructed Zhang not to act rashly and to obey the Central Government. Subsequently, Zhang stated that he needed to report on the military and political affairs of North China to Chiang and seek instructions. He specially sent Chief of Staff Bao Wenwei, carrying a personal letter from Zhang, to meet Chiang southward on the evening of the 12th, accompanied by Fang Benren, a member of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee who had traveled from Hankou to Peiping a few days ago, via a special express train. They arrived in Hankou at 5 PM on the 14th and stayed at the Yangtze River Hotel. At 8 AM on the 15th, they went together to Chiang's residence in Yihe Village to pay their respects, present Zhang's letter, and talk for about forty minutes. The content is unknown. That evening, Bao, along with his family and entourage, took the Dehe ship to Xun, and then went to Lushan. Chiang also flew to Xun on the same day. It is likely that they met again in Lushan. The reporter briefly interviewed Bao and Fang separately and recorded the following.</p>
<p>▲Bao Wenwei's Statement: Bao said that he came to represent Director Zhang to meet Commander-in-Chief Chiang. In addition to reporting on the general situation in North China, he also conveyed that although Director Zhang had resigned, in order not to further aggravate the political situation, he had decided to continue to be responsible for maintaining public order in North China until the Central Government issued a clear order of approval. At the same time, the generals in North China uniformly obeyed the Central Government and Commander-in-Chief Chiang. He needed to report this in detail to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and ask him to rest assured. Director Zhang's intention to resign was to fulfill Premier Wang's wishes. He is now waiting quietly for the Central Government's telegram of approval. As soon as it is approved, he will go to Europe. The Central Government's plan for the aftermath in North China, to abolish the Sui Public Office and establish a branch of the Military Affairs Commission, seems to be a settled matter. He has not heard anything else. This morning (the 15th) when he met Commander-in-Chief Chiang, the time was short, and apart from reporting the above situation, he did not talk much. He did not mention Zhang's resignation. He only learned about the news of Tang Yulin's resignation as Chairman of Rehe from the newspaper and did not know the truth because he had not seen the original telegram.</p>
<p>▲Fang Benren's Statement: Fang said that he went to attend the meeting of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee and only returned to Hankou yesterday with Chief of Staff Bao. This time, Director Zhang resigned but stated that he would continue to be responsible for maintaining public order before the Central Government approved it. This attitude can be described as open and forthright. The generals in North China all stated at the meeting of the Political Affairs Committee that soldiers are responsible for defending the country and should unite to resist foreign aggression. Therefore, not only Zhang obeyed the Central Government's orders, but all other generals also followed the Central Government's orders. Xu Yongchang is still in Peiping, and the defenses of Peiping and Tianjin are solid, and the area is very peaceful. Even Rehe is still quiet. Zhang sent Chief of Staff Bao to Hankou this time to report the situation in North China to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and seek instructions. (August 15th)</p>
<h3>Great Victory in Suppressing Bandits in Eastern Hubei</h3>
<p>▲Qiliping and Huang'an All Recaptured</p>
<p>▲He Duan's Remnant Bandits Trapped in Honghu, Central Hubei</p>
<p>▲Kong Hechong's Bandits Flee to Yangxin, Southern Hubei</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that the Red bandit Kuang Jixun's faction has been entrenched in Huang'an County in eastern Hubei for over eight months. Qiliping and Hekou Townships under the county are all dens of bandits, and there are as many as seven divisions of bandits in the county, including the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th divisions, as well as the Independent 1st Division and the Guard Division, totaling no less than 60,000 to 70,000 people. The puppet Guard Division is the elite of the bandits, and the puppet 11th Division is known as the Iron Army. On the 10th of this month, Chiang Fusheng's division recaptured Hekou Township, and on the 11th, they attacked Huang'an County. They fought bloody battles for two days and nights at Fengxiuyi and Dongyuemiao, about ten li from the city, with the puppet Independent 1st Division, the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th divisions, and their independent regiments and battalions, engaging in dozens of hand-to-hand combats. Chiang's division finally defeated the bandits at 4:50 PM on the 13th and occupied Huang'an County from Lianggangting and Tianmasi. Chen Jicheng's division subsequently recaptured Qiliping at 5 AM on the 14th. The bandits suffered over ten thousand casualties in each battle, and the puppet 11th Division was almost completely annihilated. From Dongyuemiao to Huang'an County, bandit corpses littered the fields, and the stench was overwhelming. After the bandits were defeated in Huang'an, the puppet government ordered the residents of the city to send one or two strong men from each family to forcibly carry the wounded bandits as they fled towards the northeast. It has been found that the area where Kuang's bandits are wreaking havoc is the border region of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces. Now that Qiliping and Xuanhuadian in Huang'an County have been recaptured by government troops, only the corner of Jinjiazhai is still occupied by the bandits, but it is also being blockaded by government troops and will be captured soon. With the total loss of the bandits' base and the destruction of their main force, it will not be difficult to completely eliminate the remaining bandits with a single effort.</p>
<p>In central Hubei, He Duan's remnant bandits have fled into Honghu. The national army is joining forces with the navy and air force to launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression campaign. He Chengjun returned to Hankou on the 14th to meet Chiang and report on the deployment. He said, "After He Duan's remnant bandits fled into Honghu, our army specially dispatched the 48th Division, the 41st Division, the Independent 37th Brigade, the Independent 38th Brigade, and 12 regiments of Wang Lingji's Sichuan army, totaling five divisions, to encircle Honghu heavily. The Zhoujiazui, which was the main base for the remaining bandits, was captured by our army a few days ago, and the bandits' military academy and arsenal were destroyed. The other important dens such as Liujiaji, Longwan, and Zhoujiaji (the location of the Red Bandit puppet Hubei provincial government) are all under our army's encirclement and will be recaptured soon. There are forty-eight mounds in the center of the lake. It is said that the bandits have over ten thousand small boats for travel, which have been bombed by our air force for days, resulting in huge losses for the bandits. In order to facilitate the search and suppression, our army has organized a team of armored motorboats to search along the mounds, in addition to warships guarding key areas at all times. We are determined to thoroughly eliminate them before the deadline set by Commander-in-Chief Chiang. As for the issue of clearing the countryside and restoring order, the bandit suppression volunteer teams and militias in each county are well organized. Even single pedestrians can travel freely without hindrance. Liu Peixu, the brigade commander, went from Qianjiang to Yuekou alone the other day, and the journey was peaceful. Now, many people in each county are returning to their hometowns, and the local area will be even more peaceful when the grain is harvested in the future. However, the agricultural tools and houses of the people have been burned down by the bandits, and the government should urgently provide relief. The provincial government previously discussed raising 100,000 yuan to handle agricultural tools and set up a credit department, but it has not yet been implemented. I will ask Chairman Xia to quickly make arrangements tomorrow to meet the urgent needs of the people."</p>
<p>In southern Hubei, Kong Hechong's bandit faction was jointly suppressed by Guo Runian, Zhang Gang, and Li Dingwu's three units, destroying the bandit dens in Yinzu and Liurenba in Daye. The remnant bandits fled to Sanxikou and Mushigang in Yangxin County. This faction is said to have 30,000 people, but they have fewer than several thousand firearms. He Chengjun originally planned to go to the area to supervise the suppression, but because central Hubei was not yet pacified, he first went to Yuekou. He will travel to Xiantao Township from Yuekou in the coming days. After the Nanchang meeting concludes and Zhu Fuyin returns to Hubei, he will go to southern Hubei to supervise the army to jointly advance with the Hunan and Jiangxi armies. Overall, the Red bandits in Hubei province, led by Kuang and He, had the greatest power, but now they have collapsed. Kong's bandits are not worth worrying about. (August 15th)</p>
<h3>The Fourth Day of Continued Trial in the Noulens Case (Continued)</h3>
<p>▲Shanghai Concession Police Witness Takes the Stand</p>
<p>(Judge) What do you want to see? (Noulens) I want to see the keys. (Judge) Now give you a key to see. You have dozens of keys, and how much will you say about one key? You have dozens of keys, how many words do you want to say? At this point, the key was handed to Noulens. (Judge) Is this key yours? (Noulens) I request that all the keys that Gaudet found on me be shown to me, and they should be taken out in the order of the indictment. (Judge) That's a lot, but I'll give them all to you to see if you say they are yours or not. At this point, all the keys were handed to Noulens. (Noulens) I request that the iron box be returned to me to see if the keys match. At this point, the court ordered an iron box to be brought out. Noulens matched the keys to the box and examined it for a long time. Suddenly (Noulens) I ask the court to record that Gaudet said that the two holes in the box were caused by the handle falling off when the box was taken to the police station, whether there was a handle on the box or not, his memory is unclear, this point should be noted. (Judge) You are really annoying. (Noulens) The mailbox key should have a number, please note the number. (Judge) They were all found on you. (Noulens) The witness in court said that there was no list of the seized items in the previous record, but now, after fourteen months, the witness said that there is a list, which is a new discovery, please note. (Judge) You have seen the keys. (Noulens) I have not seen the keys to the other two boxes, please show them to me. I have something to say about the money part. (Judge) Just say it. (Noulens) Gaudet said before that he took the keys from me to Nanjing Road to check the iron box, but none of them could be opened. Another thing to note is that Givens said that after finding the iron box at 49 Nanjing Road, the key to the post office box could be opened by anyone except four people. (Judge) I am not asking you these questions now. (Noulens) I want to make a statement about the keys, and the court cannot refuse. (Judge) You can say it later. (Noulens) According to Article 284 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the defendant has the right to make a statement about the evidence. (Judge) Do you know that you should maintain order in court? When I ask you a question, you don't answer, when I don't ask you a question, you rant and rave and can't finish. (Noulens) My answers are all related to the keys, and the keys are all relevant evidence. At this point, the judge ordered Noulens to step back and questioned Wang Delizeng again. (Judge) What are your opinions on what Gaudet and others said? (Wang) Please present the key to Room 30, Block C, 49 Nanjing Road. (Judge) You say Noulens is your husband, why did you tell Ross in Nanjing Road that you didn't know Noulens? Wang did not answer, but still asked to present the key. The presiding judge then took out the key, handed it to Wang to examine, and asked if there were any errors. Wang then requested to present the list. The presiding judge then changed and brought in Noulens, saying that there was a lot of evidence in the iron box. Many items were presented last time, and part of them are presented again today, including the election outline of the First National Congress of Chinese Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, the work plan of the trade union, the Manchurian Red Flag No. 89, the Manchurian Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, 18 maps published in Japan, Zhu Baolin's leadership of the Seamen's Riot, the situation of the Soviet area being attacked by enemy troops, the Soviet area's request to the Central Committee to establish a central bureau, Luo Yi's report to the Central Committee on the situation of the Red Army, the instructions of the anti-Li Lisan line to the Red Army on how to avoid poison gas, the situation of the Shanghai labor unrest, the tasks of the Chinese Communist Party, the situation of the Communist Party's activities in North China, a list of twelve students, the resolutions of the Fifth International Red Conference and the Chinese revolutionary movement, an English diary, the situation of the Shanghai Red Trade Union activities, the Chinese Communist Party's activities in Shanghai and the trade union movement, the situation of Spidatarav's preparations for the workers' struggle, information about the activities of the Red Army in Jiangxi, the Seamen's General Union's order for workers to act, a map of China with red lines indicating the locations of the Red Army's confrontation with the National Army, the Chinese Communist Party's training of peasant and worker activities, the establishment of the Soviet area on the border of Hunan, Anhui, and Hubei, Trotsky's counter-revolutionary forces in China, the Communist Party's current riot after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Executive Committee of the International Communist Party in Guangdong, the activities of the Red Army's Fourth Army in Hunan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces, the increase of party members to form new Soviet areas and the CPU organization, etc. The first volume of the evidence book, from pages 1 to 66, was handed to Noulens to read, and said that this was searched from the three iron boxes, some of which were in his own handwriting, some were modified by him, and some were typed by a typewriter, including English, German, French, and Russian texts. After reading it, Noulens said that the first to fourth items were not signed, and requested to present the confiscated typewriter. At this time, the presiding judge ordered Gaudet and others to present the search list of Nanjing Road and other parts to the court, and ordered them to sign one by one before leaving. Noulens and Wang had not yet stated their opinions on the process described by Gaudet and others, so they complained a lot. The presiding judge said that when Gaudet and others did not appear in court, Noulens and Wang were slow to mention the opinions they wanted to state, and then deliberately made trouble after Gaudet and others left, so he announced that the case was scheduled to continue at 8 AM on the 16th, and said to Noulens, "Your application (1) to copy the evidence of the 10th, 11th, and 12th has been done, (2) to translate the written record and confession is not in accordance with the law and is rejected, (3) to enlarge the South Ferry photo, there is no such precedent and is rejected." Then he ordered the Noulens couple to be returned to prison and adjourned the court. It was already 1:20 PM.</p>
<h3>Record of the Fifth Day of the Noulens Case Trial</h3>
<p>▲Noulens and Wang Refuse to Sign the Trial Records</p>
<p>▲The Court Appoints a Lawyer to Defend Noulens and Wang</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Higher Court continued to hear the Noulens and Wang Delizeng case of endangering the Republic of China at the Jiangning Local Court at 9 AM on the 16th. The judges present were as before, and lawyer Chen Ying also attended. After the judges ascended the bench, the presiding judge, Li Mian, first said to the defendant's lawyer, Chen Ying, "This case has been heard several times, and your lawyer has never spoken in defense. Now the interrogation is about to end. Your lawyer, for the sake of protecting the legal interests of the defendant, if you think there is anything that needs to be defended, you can give full play to it, but please do not speak outside the scope of defense." Chen Ying said that the defendant had objections to the competent authorities in this case and only entrusted our lawyer to attend the court to record the proceedings and did not authorize our lawyer to defend, so it was not convenient to speak. The clerk was then ordered to read out the records of the three trials on the 10th, 11th, and 12th of this month, which were translated by the translator Yang Zhaolong. At the beginning of the reading, Noulens repeatedly raised various issues outside the scope of the recorded confession, or because he was not familiar with the order of the recorded confession, he argued loudly, bringing up irrelevant matters. The judge said that the purpose of reading this record was to prevent errors in the record that would hinder the defendant's interests. If the defendant thought there was an error, he could only declare it at any time and request correction, but could not raise supplementary words that would not be consistent with the original confession. If he debated like this at every point, it was feared that even the entire time of this court would not be enough to read the record. Later, Noulens requested that a copy of the record be given to him for verification, and the court agreed. The reading was then continued. Whenever there were important key points, such as the identification of evidence and the relationship with the Communist Party, the defendant and the lawyer scrutinized and translated each word and sentence, which took a lot of time. Whenever the defendant thought that there was indeed an error and made a reasonable request for correction, it was corrected at any time. It was not until 12:30 that the reading was completed.</p>
<p>The presiding judge then called Noulens and Wang Delizeng to sign, but Noulens and Wang said that they did not understand the Chinese records and did not know the corrected content, so they refused to sign. The presiding judge then presented Noulens with the English list of items seized from the Nanjing Road and other houses. Noulens then raised arguments against the items on the English list, bit by bit, extremely complicated and trivial. At 1:20 PM, the presiding judge announced that the court would be adjourned for today and could be questioned again tomorrow. Noulens was still talking endlessly. The presiding judge asked lawyer Chen Ying, "Now there is something I want to ask, that is, can your lawyer be responsible to this court for defending the parties?" Chen stated that the parties only authorized the recording and correction of translation rights, and as for the right to defend, he had declared in court earlier that it was canceled. The presiding judge said that since Chen was absent , sitting in the lawyer's seat in the courtroom, problems have arisen. Noulens also made a statement on , and the two sides argued for a long time. The presiding judge said that since the party had no lawyer, according to the Criminal Procedure Law, the presiding judge could appoint two lawyers to defend the party. He appointed two people, one of whom was good at German and English, and asked Noulens whether he recognized them. Noulens said that since it had not been agreed to by him, it would be difficult to admit it. Again, there was a long argument. The presiding judge then announced that he would be interrogated again tomorrow (the 17th) at 8 AM and adjourned the court. It was already 1:55 PM.</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>▲Tiger Plague Spreads Everywhere, Many Deaths</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang states that at the beginning of summer in this province, there were continuous heavy rains and floods. The fields along the Gan River, Fu River, and Poyang Lake were completely submerged, and many of the dikes built with work-for-relief programs also collapsed and have not been repaired to this day. After the floods, it has not rained since June 20th, nearly two months, and the hot sun has been shining, with no rain at all, which has had a profound impact on agriculture. At the time of the busy harvest last month, farmers not only had to use waterwheels to irrigate the late rice, but also had to draw water to plant the second-season rice. The wage for short-term labor increased from three cents to one yuan, but there were still no workers to hire. Very few of the soybeans for the second-season rice were planted. Currently, the fields in higher areas are already withered and cracked, and the fields in lower areas are also dry because the lakes, ports, ponds, and springs have all been dried up, and the green rice has also turned withered. The land is scorched for thousands of miles, and it is feared that there will be no harvest at all. In recent days, although there have been occasional dark clouds and faint thunder, it is still just the sky being dry and the rain not falling, just a sigh of relief for the poor. In Linchuan, Xinjian, Nanfeng, and other places, not only the fields are withered, but the drinking water in the wells has also caused panic. The Xinjian County government has received countless disaster reports from various districts, all of which state that it has not rained for a long time, the rice seedlings have all withered, the land is scorched for thousands of miles, there will be no harvest, and they request that the provincial government be petitioned to reduce the land tax and provide relief to the disaster victims. The county magistrate has reported the situation to the Department of Civil Affairs of the provincial government.</p>
<p>Currently, the tiger plague is raging, which is due to the lack of rain, increased heat, dry air, and flying dust, which are enough to increase the power of the tiger plague. Therefore, the tiger plague has spread almost all over the province. In the past month, the number of people who have died of the plague in Nanchang, Raozhou, Jingzhen, Leping, Zhangshu, Gao'an, and other places has been in the thousands. Recently, the plague in Linchuan, Yugan, Fuliang, and other places has continued to increase, and has spread from cities to villages. According to a visitor from Linchuan, more than a thousand people have died in the county seat in the past month, and members of the county party department and the chief of the local court have all contracted the tiger plague, vomiting and diarrhea, and dying within a few hours. Poor people often have entire families perish. The supply of coffins cannot meet the demand, which has not been seen in decades. A group of ignorant people do not know how to properly prevent the epidemic and only know how to pray to gods and worship Buddha. Within a month, the cost of holding religious ceremonies in Linchuan was more than 50,000 yuan, and the cost of rural superstitions is not included. According to medical circles, with this amount of money used for proper epidemic prevention, the entire county can be universally injected with serum and vaccines, which is truly incomprehensible. According to a letter from Ji'an, after the tiger plague broke out in the county, people could be seen dying one after another. According to a survey, more than 70 people died in three days. A letter from Ganzhou states that the tiger plague has spread from Nanxiong to Ganzhou, and patients can die within a few hours. The city was captured by bandits last year and then besieged by bandits, and all medicines have long been exhausted, and there is nothing that can be done to provide relief. In Nanchang city, after the well water was disinfected and the citizens were universally vaccinated, the epidemic has slowed down slightly, but the spread from the city to the countryside has intensified. In the Wanshou Palace area of Xinjian, the tiger plague is rampant, and countless people have died. In the Chen family in Zhuyuan, more than 40 people died in ten days out of more than 50 households, which is truly shocking. (August 13th)</p>
<h3>Urgent Reports from Various Dangerous Sections of the Lu and Yellow Rivers</h3>
<p>▲ Water Level Rises to Last Year's Highest Point</p>
<p>▲ County Magistrates Along the River Ordered by Han to Reside on the Riverbank</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Recently, due to continuous autumn rains, the water level of the Yellow River has been rising continuously in the upper, middle, and lower reaches. At Dongzhuang in the upper reaches, the water level has reached 58.37 meters, equaling the highest water level of last year. Other sections are also nearly at last year's peak. Chairman of Shandong Province, Han Fuqu, telegraphed River Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia this morning, as well as the county magistrates of the 21 counties along the riverbanks—Yuncheng, Pu, Fan, Shou Zhang, Yanggu, Dong'a, Pingyin, Feicheng, Changqing, Qihe, Licheng, Jiyang, Huimin, Bin County, Lijin, Heze, Dongping, Zhangqiu, Qidong, Qingcheng, and Putai—ordering them to immediately move to the riverbanks in person to devote their full energy to supervising the emergency repairs and strengthen the defenses. They are not permitted to return to their counties until the water level drops by two feet. River Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia also telegraphed all river workers to work day and night, personally supervising the emergency repairs. They must especially and thoroughly inspect the dikes and dams for weak spots, holes, and rat burrows. River Affairs Bureau personnel will also work as usual, regardless of day, night, or weekends, with the work being extraordinarily tense. At the Zhukou dangerous section on the border of Hebei and Shandong, the main current is eroding the bank, and the pressed hemp bags and bricks are almost level with the water. The main current at Lisheng Village is directly impacting the ninth and tenth dams with exceptional force. The ninth dam is visibly collapsing by the day, and the tenth dam has one break underwater. The beach opposite Wang Zaojia in the lower reaches has been scoured away by the current, and the current is gradually shifting downward, with extremely strong scouring force. The revetments downstream are under increasing pressure, and two sections of the revetments have shifted. Zhang Lianjia is currently still at that site, supervising the work day and night, braving the rain to lead the emergency repairs. Today, the water level at Luokou has risen by 1.8 centimeters, reaching a level of 29.87 meters. The telegram from Han Fuqu to the county magistrates is recorded below: "To River Affairs Bureau Director and all County Magistrates along the River: Given the continuous rise in the Yellow River and the approaching autumn winds, it is extremely easy for accidents to occur. The lives and property of countless people will be submerged. As county magistrates, you bear an inescapable responsibility for your localities. You must devote your full energy to focusing on defense and immediately move to the riverbanks in person to supervise the work. You may only return to your posts after the water level has dropped by two feet and I, the Chairman, have approved it by telegram. You must all strictly comply with this order and report back. Chairman Han, sealed on a cold day." (August 15th)</p>
<h3>All Circles in Anhui Participate in the Anti-War Alliance</h3>
<p>▲ Representatives Selected to Attend the General Assembly in Shanghai</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation and the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce, along with all sectors of society, have joined the Anti-Civil War Alliance. As the alliance is scheduled to hold a general assembly on August 27th, Song Ziheng, the president of the Bank of China, has been specially recommended as a representative to attend in Shanghai. The proposal has also been sent to the assembly in advance. The original text is as follows: "Since the restoration of our country, those in power should have taken advantage of the national desire for governance and the opportunity presented by the European war to enlighten the people, develop industry, improve military preparedness, and strive for good governance. Even if we could not dominate East Asia, we would not have been humiliated by powerful neighbors. However, years of internal warfare have continued endlessly, causing useful young men and vast amounts of weapons to be sacrificed and consumed in the mutual struggle for territory without any value. Alas, first, we were suppressing remnants of warlords, then suppressing communists and bandits. The whole country was in a state of panic, with no peaceful years. Coupled with years of disasters and poor harvests, we are financially and physically exhausted, leading to the humiliation of Shenyang and the humiliation of Shanghai, one after another. The situation is as precarious as a pile of eggs. Now, to abolish internal warfare and avoid the irreversible disaster, we respectfully offer our views for adoption: (1) Refuse to allow the country to issue internal war bonds, mortgage loans, or advance collection of land taxes; refuse all financial supplies of gold and silver. (2) Refuse private requisitioning of ships, vehicles, horses, and labor by those engaged in internal warfare; refuse material support. (3) Persuade officers and soldiers of the army and navy not to serve private internal warfare. (4) Persuade railway and shipping workers not to serve private internal warfare." (August 14th)</p>
<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>▲ Case of Son Assaulting Mother in Xinzhuang Brought to Justice: A man surnamed Chen in Xinzhuang, who is quite wealthy, has three sons. His mother, Madam Chen Wang, is nearly sixty years old. The eldest son, Guangxin, is married and has his own family. The mother divided the household for her sons, and Guangxin lives alone in the old house, while the second son lives in the new house. Recently, because the second son is studying away from home, he rented out the residence. Unexpectedly, Guangxin, for some unknown reason, went to his brother's house, smashed the doors and windows. When the old mother came out to stop him, he brutally beat her, injuring her arm, which is now bruised. The matter was reported to the Public Security Sub-station, which arrested Guangxin. The victim, Chen Wang, also reported the situation. Local people believe that such an act of impiety and brutality against one's own parent should be punished. The patrol officer prepared a document and sent him to Songjiang on the 16th. After a preliminary hearing by the Public Security Bureau, he was ordered to be sent to the County Court for trial.</p>
<p>▲ Flourishing of the Insurance Business After the Fire: Since Dafeng Silk Shop in this city was careless, causing a fire that spread to several neighboring houses, resulting in considerable losses, insurance companies from Shanghai have sent representatives to Songjiang to establish branch offices and develop business.

<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>▲ Unfortunate Incident During Bandit Suppression: Zhangliantang, Jinze, Guanwang Temple, Xicen, and other areas in Qingpu County are places where bandits frequently appear, and kidnappings and robberies are common occurrences. There have also been several cases of small boats on the inland river being robbed. To eliminate harm for the people, the Qingpu County Government held a bandit suppression conference in Zhangliantang at 1:00 PM on the 10th of this month and decided to set out in full force that evening to clear the territory of bandits within twenty days. Unexpectedly, at around 7:00 PM that night, Cao Guisheng, a patrolman under Wang Yulin of the County Water Patrol Team, was holding Wang's No. 3546 automatic pistol and suddenly fired a shot at a pedestrian, Wang Jinqian, on the central street of Zhangliantang. Wang was injured and fled into the Gongyimao shop. Cao chased after him and fired two more shots, hitting him in vital areas. Wang immediately collapsed in the second courtyard of the Gongyimao shop. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, immediately fled. Fortunately, Song Yaozhang, a shop assistant at Gongyimao, followed him and apprehended him in front of the headquarters of the Security Corps. The next morning, the murderer was sent to the county. The county government specially sent investigating officer Shi Wending to the town at noon on the 12th to inspect the body and confirmed that he had been shot twice in vital areas and died. The deceased had a young child who cried loudly on the spot, begging for justice. Those who heard it could not help but shed tears. Since the incident occurred, the citizens of the town have been very angry. Dozens of shops, including Gongyimao, Gongtai, Dianfu, and Fukang, have jointly petitioned the county government, demanding that the murderer in this case be severely punished and that the county government should clearly indicate how the lives of the people will be protected in the future. The district office, the town office, and the local gentry will all express their serious concerns.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>▲ Party Department Dispute Escalates: The county party department is being sued by the Anti-Japanese Association and businesses at the provincial party headquarters and provincial government for allegedly mismanaging the anti-Japanese association's funds. Recently, a dispute arose over the re-election of the party departments in districts 1, 2, and 3, with new party members from other areas having improper procedures. The district party departments have accused the county party department of private manipulation of the election and have sent telegrams to the provincial party headquarters requesting investigation and handling.</p>
<p>▲ Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group Warns Traitorous Merchants: After the establishment of the National Salvation and Anti-Traitor Group in this county, the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group was also established. The other day, a silk and foreign goods store in Shaxi was discovered to have secretly imported twenty pieces of direct tribute wool and twenty pieces of twill from enemy countries. A silk and cloth store in the Xishi market of Zhintang was discovered to have secretly imported over three thousand taels of enemy goods. The Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group learned of this and sent a letter of warning, which stated in essence that the sale of Japanese goods has been increasing in this county recently, and the situation in Rehe and Tianjin is becoming increasingly critical. Driven by conscience and boiling with hot blood, the group had no choice but to warn the store to seal up or even burn all Japanese goods within one week. If future sales of enemy goods are discovered, the group will take the most severe measures. Do not say you were not warned.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Anti-Traitor Group Warns Jingde Company: After the signing of the Shanghai Incident agreement, the Jingzhong Anti-Traitor Group was organized in Suzhou and began its secret investigation. The Jingde Department Store on Guanqian Street in Suzhou received a letter from the Anti-Traitor Group, stating that it had heard that the company was secretly selling enemy goods and would take drastic measures if it continued to do so. The next day, it received another letter with similar wording. In addition to sending the original letter to the Public Security Bureau, the company posted a notice at the entrance stating that it did not sell Japanese goods.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Party Department Investigates Zheng Ying: Zheng Ying, the Shanghai woman who publicly promoted licentiousness in Suzhou last summer, left Suzhou and returned to Shanghai after the Public Security Bureau ordered her arrest. Recently, the Shanghai Special City Party Department received a report that Zheng Ying had joined a reactionary organization and was luring young men, using lust as a pretext to spread reaction. She recently secretly arrived in Suzhou and is hiding in the Huayuan Hotel. Therefore, officials were sent from Shanghai the other day to Suzhou to join the Wu County Party Department and the Public Security Bureau in sending officials to the Huayuan Hotel to investigate, but she was not there. They are currently conducting a thorough investigation in various hotels.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲ Resolution of the Small Boat Destruction Case: The Huayu small boat of the Zhonghua Hengyu Shipping Company, which operates between Wuxi and Caohe, was passing by Donggang Bridge near Xindu Bridge the other day when it was suddenly blocked by over a hundred villagers holding yellow stones who had gathered on the bridge. They also smashed the boat and beat the cook, Jiang Hanqing, and others. The troublemaking villager, You Zibing, was brought to the city and sent to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau for investigation. It is now learned that the case has been mediated by Qian Chongqing, a local dignitary from Xindu Bridge, who persuaded the people of the town to abide by the law in the future and not to cause trouble lightly. They also offered compensation for the company's losses as a resolution. As for the troublemaker, You Zibing, the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau leniently sentenced him to detention as punishment. The Huayu small boat, for the convenience of transportation, resumed its regular schedule yesterday.</p>

Trainer Zhang Yaoqing led the corps members to search at night and captured two notorious bandits, Pei Jinsheng and Tai Rongbao. After interrogation, they confessed to committing multiple kidnapping and extortion cases and were sent to the county for trial on the 15th.</p>
<p>▲ Traitorous Merchants Paraded Through the Streets: Recently, five traitorous merchants, including Diao Guangcai, were found in Benniu Town, Wuyi County, along with three items of enemy goods. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association was notified and decided on the 15th to confiscate all enemy goods. Diao Guangcai and the other four were unable to pay the fine and will be paraded through the streets and photographed for publication in the newspaper. The sentence will be carried out within days.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>▲ Customs Patrol Boat Seizes Opium: Chen Zhixing, captain of patrol boat No. 3 of the 3rd squadron of the 16th Customs Patrol Team, received a report on the afternoon of the 12th that a Wusong ship was transporting 2,250 taels of opium, which belonged to Yang Lianzi, an opium smuggler from Jingjiang, and Cheng Tiansheng, an opium smuggler from Jiangyin. It was being unloaded at Juegang in Jiangbei. Chen immediately arrived at Juegang at 1:00 AM on the 13th and seized 1,500 taels of opium from Yang Lianzi, totaling sixteen large cakes. Cheng Tiansheng escaped. It is unknown where the opium was taken. Squadron Leader Ling Xichao questioned Chen about it on the 14th, but Chen denied seizing any opium, making it a suspicious case.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>▲ Fugitive Dike Worker Arrested and Sent to County: Xu Ruiao, the supervisor of the Laishing'an dike project in Jiangbei, caused a major dike failure due to his negligence. After the provincial government ordered the county to secretly arrest him, he was not found. The fugitive suddenly returned to Danyang yesterday and was discovered by Patrol Officer Zhou of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, who led the police to arrest him on the spot. He has now been sent to the county by the general office.</p>
<p>▲ Traitorous Merchants Arrested in Lucheng: The Danyang County Party Department received a telegram from Jiang Qian of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in Lucheng Town, stating that seven Jiangbei traitorous merchants, including Jiang Xumao, were carrying various kinds of enemy goods and staying at the Huangjia Inn. After investigation, they were arrested by the association together with the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau and sent to Danyang this afternoon. The county party department has instructed the Anti-Japanese Association to send people to meet and detain them.</p>
<p>▲ Drought and Famine Repeatedly Reported in Northwestern Townships: This county has had little rainfall in recent months, and most of the crops in the fields have withered. The drought is particularly severe in the highlands of the northwestern townships, and the autumn harvest is disappointing. Farmers from those townships have come to the county to report the famine. County Magistrate Wang has personally gone to the townships to investigate. It is also reported that locusts have appeared in the northern townships, and the county government has ordered the agricultural station to send people to investigate and quickly supervise the farmers to exterminate them.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>▲ One-Week Commemoration of the Grand Canal Breach: According to the Gregorian calendar, the Grand Canal breach last autumn was on August 26th, but most villagers adhere to the lunar calendar, which puts it on July 13th. This year, on the lunar July 13th, the various sectors of Shaobo Town, where the most breaches occurred in this county, initiated a one-week commemoration and memorial service for the compatriots who died in the disaster. It is said that in addition to holding a memorial service that day, high-ranking monks were invited to offer salvation to the souls of those who died unjustly. In the evening, lotus lanterns and paper ingots were released on the Xiangwai two rivers, to commemorate the lonely ghosts who were drowned. When the lanterns were released and the ingots burned, the wailing of the families of the victims on both banks shook the fields, and those who heard it could not help but feel heartbroken. It is a pity that those in charge of the entire Grand Canal project before the breach did not hear this crying and let them examine their hearts. It is also learned that the disaster relief association will still hold a large-scale memorial service on the 26th.</p>
<p>▲ Anti-Japanese Association Seizes Enemy Goods: The Fangyuanxing Yarn Shop on E'gengxiangwan, this city, was found to be secretly selling enemy goods yesterday (14th). The Anti-Japanese Association sent people to seize fifty bundles of Japanese yarn and immediately took them back to be sealed up. A full committee meeting was convened at 3:00 PM today (15th) to discuss how to deal with Fangyuanxing.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>▲ Banditry Rages Again in Eastern Townships: Recently, there has been another bandit uprising in Yiyu and other areas in the eastern townships of Tongyi County. The situation is very rampant. After the police and militia suppressed them, the bandits resisted stubbornly. Fifteen bandits were captured on the 14th, and seven machine guns and more than ten rifles were seized. They were sent to the county government on the 15th. Upon learning of this, all sectors of the local community were deeply concerned that the horrific situation of the 18th year of the Republic would return. On the 15th, an emergency meeting was held at the Chamber of Commerce, chaired by County Magistrate Zhang Dong, who proposed that the situation in the eastern townships was urgent and that the county government should request Commander Zhu of the provincial security regiment stationed in the city to quickly send a team to Yiyu to suppress the uprising. It was decided to recommend Gu Zuoqing and Shen Shaochang to go to the regiment headquarters to contact him. Commander Zhu immediately dispatched a team to suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>▲ Estimated Cotton Harvest in Tongzhou: According to the county agricultural station, the area of cotton fields in Nantong this year is estimated to be about 1,189,000 mu, accounting for 45% of the county's area, a decrease of one-tenth compared to last year. The current cotton crop is still good, and the estimated cotton yield is an average of 60 jin of seed cotton per mu, with a total of about 710,000 dan for the county.</p>
<p>▲ Searching for Drifting Soldiers and Scattered Braves: All armed groups in Nantong held a meeting on the 15th, convened by Commander Zhu of the provincial security regiment, and decided to form a patrol team to search for drifting soldiers and scattered braves.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>▲ Long Drought, No Rain, Blessed with Timely Rain: This county has not had rain for months since the beginning of summer. The rivers are dry, and the crops are withering. On the afternoon of the 12th, there was a sudden downpour, and the weather suddenly became cooler. Although it was very short, the people's hearts were greatly comforted.</p>
<p>▲ Penniless, Hanged Himself in a Shed: Zheng Fuyuan, a farmer in Guba Town, had previously borrowed 14 yuan from Liu Kunxiang. Because Liu was urging him to repay the debt and Zheng was unable to do so, Zheng, in a moment of desperation, went to Liu's shed at night on the 11th and hanged himself.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>▲ Homicide Occurs in Daqiao Township: Yao Zou, the wife of Yao A'er, a farmer in Zhijiabang, Daqiao Township, Jiaxing, had an affair with her neighbor Zhu A'san. On the 7th of this month, A'er was beaten by the adulterer, and then beaten again by the adulterer's father, Zhu A'da. A'er suddenly disappeared. On the 10th, A'er's torn clothes and shoes were found on the bank of the river in Bangnei. After a search by people in the river, A'er's body was found. The two murderers immediately fled. The branch office ordered the police to arrest Yao Zou and Zhu A'san's mother and bring them to the bureau. As the case is a major homicide, it has been reported to the local branch court for an autopsy. Meanwhile, the main criminals are being strictly pursued for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>▲ Unprecedented Fire in Cicheng: The Guzhu Paper Shop between Zhuxiangkou and Shixingkou in Cixi City caught fire on the evening of the 12th. Because the manager, Shao, was out, the shop assistants locked the shop door and went upstairs to gamble. Later, a customer wanted to buy something from the shop and saw that the door was locked, so he knocked on the door. The apprentices upstairs heard the sound and thought the manager had returned to the shop, so they rushed to clean up the gambling equipment, accidentally knocking over a Mobil lamp, which burned the paper materials on the ground. The fire immediately raged, bursting through the roof and spreading rapidly. It burned for four hours from 11:00 PM on the 12th to 3:00 AM the next morning before it was extinguished. A total of more than 200 street houses were burned down. The victims included more than 30 stores, including Guzhu Paper Shop, Tianzhang Hat Shop, Shendacheng Fruit Shop, Rongzhangxiang Silk Shop, Baoyuan Silver Shop, Baoyu Silver Shop, Mobil Oil Company, Chunhuaxiang Silk and Foreign Goods Advertising, Chengzhang Silk and Foreign Goods Shop, Taichang South Goods, and Demao Oil Candle, with losses of more than 500,000 yuan. It was truly an unprecedented fire in Cicheng.</p>
<p>▲ Tragedy Occurs While Watching a Play on a Stage: Shen Yingxiang, a resident of Wucheyan, Yuyao, is over sixty years old. He used to be the manager of the Zhihe Money Shop in Shanghai and was well-known in the business community. Later, because Zhihe went bankrupt, he returned to his native Wuche for residence. On the evening of the 12th of this month, because Wucheyan was putting on a ghost opera, the stage was conveniently located in front of Shen's house. Yingxiang ordered the servants to build a stage in front of the door to watch the play. At about 10:00 PM, a man speaking with a Shanghai accent squeezed onto Yingxiang's stage. After clarifying that it was Yingxiang, he drew a pistol and fired at him. At that time, Yingxiang's second daughter had also returned to Ningbo to watch the play and was next to her father. Fearing that her father would be kidnapped by the thugs, she quickly hugged her father with both hands. Unexpectedly, the man shot her second daughter. Both father and daughter were hit by a bullet. Yingxiang's second son, Shanfu, heard the gunshot in the house and went outside to ask. Five or six thugs suddenly appeared and fired at Shanfu, who immediately fell to the ground and died shortly after. At this time, a farmer from the Linshan Lake dike, someone named Jia, was also watching the play and looked at the thugs after seeing Shanfu fall to the ground. The thugs shot at Jia, hitting a vital spot, and he also died on the spot. Three of Yingxiang's servants were also wounded by the thugs with guns. After the thugs shot down Yingxiang and others, they fled one after another.</p>

<h3>The Lowest Hopes for the National Sports Conference ·Hao Gengsheng·</h3>
<p>Physical education has long been a focus of national defense in the East and West, and has been particularly emphasized since the European War. It is an important part of the entire educational process and is of great importance to the nation's vitality and national spirit. However, successive rulers in our country have not paid attention to it. Today, the national situation is becoming increasingly weak, which is largely due to the failure of politics, economics, and the entire education system to be on the right track. However, the lack of physical strength and the lack of energy among the general population are also major factors. Today, the government, in the midst of a serious national crisis, has convened the National Sports Conference to plan the implementation of national sports, which is a very good intention. However, this conference is a new event in the history of our country, and its nature is for open national discussion, so there will be many proposals and the scope will be broad. With a little carelessness, the result of the discussion will inevitably repeat the mistakes of general conferences, with trivial details being emphasized and the fundamental issues being ignored. I believe that to avoid this, the proposals at this conference should be broadly divided into two groups:</p>
<p>(1) Research Aspect - relating to curriculum, teaching materials, testing, investigation, and personnel training, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Administrative Aspect - relating to facilities, organization, meetings, inspections, and international competitions, etc.</p>
<p>The above two points should be regarded as the general outline for the research of this conference. According to this general outline, although there are many proposals, they can be integrated and connected, and will not interfere with each other, so that the researchers can calmly recognize their true value, and the future implementation of each proposal after it is passed can also be promoted accordingly to achieve success. Now, I would like to express my lowest hope for this conference based on this general outline:</p>
<p>(1) The government should carefully select one or two academic institutions or organizations with more history and better performance, designate them as national sports research centers, and sponsor them to broadly recruit sports scholars from home and abroad, conduct in-depth research based on modern science and great historical background, and find ways to solve all current sports problems, so that national sports administrators have something to follow.</p>
<p>(2) Under the central administrative system of the government, a national sports administrative general agency should be established, and sports administrative talents from home and abroad should be widely recruited (the number should not be large, but it must fully implement the established plan), cooperate and connect with local sports agencies and sports, and promote the plans decided by the central government based on the findings of the researchers. If so, then the scattered national sports can gradually get on the right track, and the gains from this conference, at a minimum, can lay a more systematic foundation for national sports facilities.</p>
<h3>—Opening Ceremony of the Conference—</h3>
<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday, the opening ceremony of the conference was held. After the bell rang, the members entered the venue one after another.

<p>Opening speech by Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Education and Chairman of the Conference:</p>
<p>Central Committee members, representatives of various ministries, representatives from various regions, esteemed physical education experts, today marks the inaugural National Physical Education Conference held in the capital. I am deeply honored by your presence. This conference is a pioneering event in China, the result of a long period of deliberation. Back in July of the eighteenth year [of the Republic], the West Lake Exposition initiated the National Games. At that time, the Ministry of Education planned to convene a national physical education conference and appointed Mr. Chu Minyi as the director of preparations. Originally scheduled to coincide with the National Games in Hangzhou in September, the conference was postponed due to the postponement of the Games. The Ministry of Education also convened the Second National Education Conference at this time, making it difficult to attend to both. Furthermore, Mr. Chu Minyi was traveling to Belgium to attend the Universal Exposition commemorating the centennial of Belgian independence, which prevented the conference from taking place. The outbreak of national crisis has further exposed the physical weaknesses of the Chinese people, and it is widely recognized that promoting national physical education is essential to revitalize the national spirit. The Ministry, recognizing this urgency, convened the First National Physical Education Conference. We initially set the standards for membership and the number of participants, along with a budget, which was approved by the Executive Yuan. Today marks the opening ceremony. The conference regulations and the organizational outline of the preparatory committee were previously promulgated by the Ministry, and we appointed members to the preparatory committee, including Mr. Chu Minyi as the director, to actively prepare. This is the history of the conference's preparation and establishment.</p>
<p>The members attending this conference include the directors of physical education from national, provincial, and registered private universities or independent colleges, physical education instructors or heads of public sports fields selected by provincial and municipal education departments, principals of national, provincial, municipal, and registered private physical education colleges, directors of national martial arts institutes from the central government and various provinces and cities, physical education experts invited by the Ministry of Education, and representatives from various ministries and commissions. We have brought together administrative personnel and physical education experts to jointly promote national education, discuss physical education implementation plans, unify training guidelines, and foster the physical development, fitness, and strength of the people, as well as improve national health and revitalize the national spirit. Its significance and mission are of great importance. In addition to the draft implementation plan for national physical education drafted by experts Wu Yunrui, Yuan Dunli, and Hao Gengsheng, who were previously appointed by the Ministry of Education, the conference will also discuss over 200 proposals received from members. After careful deliberation by all members, various resolutions will be passed and either promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Education or forwarded to relevant agencies for reference. This will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to school physical education in the future, which is the first thing I must report to everyone.</p>
<p>Physical education occupies an extremely important position in education. We know that education is not merely about imparting knowledge. The purpose of modern education is, on the one hand, to train individuals in the overall functioning of their bodies to aid their growth, and on the other hand, to ensure that individuals, with their healthy bodies, can adapt to the demands of social evolution. While there is more than one educational method, their function is to achieve the aforementioned goals. Modern philosophy, psychology, and biology all recognize the close relationship between the human body and mind. Although physical education involves the movement of large muscles in the human body to aid physical development and enhance health, its effects must lead to psychological changes through physiological changes. Therefore, physical education is closely related to intellectual, moral, aesthetic, and physical development. The common failings of Chinese education today are, on the one hand, the inability to cultivate practical talents for the production sector, and on the other hand, the inability to cultivate loyal, courageous, and aspiring citizens. The insult of being called the "sick man of East Asia" has yet to be erased. The reason lies in what is self-evident. We, who strive for education, should recognize the environment and never blindly copy. What China needs today is education that promotes production and education that revitalizes the national spirit. In terms of revitalizing the national spirit, it is not something that can be achieved merely through slogans and declarations. We must do our best to develop the physical fitness, ability, and strength of the people to create loyal, courageous, and aspiring citizens, and then we can revitalize the national spirit. In the past, physical education in Chinese education was seriously lacking. Although school education had formal physical education courses, due to the lack of talent, insufficient funding, and methods that were not fully appropriate, it contributed very little to youth physical education. As for national physical education in social education, it is still in its infancy. We are heartbroken by the national crisis and look to the future, asking how we can make a tremendous determination to eliminate the accumulated problems in education and open up new opportunities for future education. This is what those engaged in education today should strive for together.</p>
<p>Another point is that the purpose of promoting physical education is to enable the physical fitness, ability, and strength of all Chinese people to develop universally in order to revitalize the national spirit. However, those who are ignorant fail to see this and only focus on sports meets and athletic associations in various places, emphasizing competition in the skills of a small number of people, as if only promoting an abnormality without universal implications. They also believe that these few people often do not study other subjects or engage in other occupations besides physical education. Therefore, people generally harbor doubts and do not pay attention to it. They do not know that at a time when school physical education and national physical education in China have not yet developed, we need these few people to devote all their efforts to it, just like revolutionary work. There is no reward without sacrifice. We can even say that these few people are the sacrificers in the period of promoting physical education. This conference will inevitably be heard and doubted by society, or even dismissed as an unimportant matter during the national crisis. This must be explained to the outside world first.</p>
<p>Zhu Jiahua's opening speech (photographed by Guanghua, Nanjing)</p>
<p>The conference is scheduled for only five days, and time is extremely pressing. I hope that all members will pay attention to time economy and strive to avoid any vague theories or unimportant disputes. As for the members and experts who have come from afar to participate in this unprecedented event, I would like to express my deep gratitude on behalf of the Ministry. How to realize the Ministry's hope in convening this conference will depend on all the representatives and experts. I wish you all success in our joint efforts.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi's Report</h3>
<p>▲Reporting on the Preparations</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, Director of the Preparatory Committee, reported on the preparations in great detail, describing the origins of the conference, the organization of the Preparatory Committee, the preparation process, the appointment of experts, the conference venue and reception, and funding, etc. As reported by Peng Baichuan and Guo Lianfeng in yesterday's newspaper, there are only minor differences, so I will not repeat them.</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu's Instructions from the Central Party Headquarters Representative</h3>
<p>▲Integrate the National Spirit with Chinese and Western Physical Education</p>
<p>▲Formulate a Plan Suitable for the Economic Environment</p>
<p>▲Develop Physical Education in a Simple Way</p>
<p>▲For National Survival, There Must Be Physical Creation</p>
<p>▲The Results of the Conference Should Be Implemented Earnestly</p>
<p>Today, I am very honored to participate in this grand event. The chairman has spoken in great detail about the significance of the conference. What I will say is only a small amount, merely to supplement his remarks.</p>
<p>I have heard that in addition to the implementation plan for national physical education drafted by specially appointed experts, over 200 proposals have been received. Among them, there must be many valuable proposals. In recent years, there have been two contradictory phenomena in Chinese academic circles: on the one hand, there is a strong effort to promote Chinese national essence and oppose foreign culture, and on the other hand, there is an absolute worship of Western culture and opposition to inherent Chinese things. These two contradictory phenomena are very obvious in medicine, art, and physical education. Both are wrong. If we study Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, we see that his efforts in the revolution were to seek survival for the nation and freedom and equality for the country. He paid close attention to the promotion of national self-confidence. National self-confidence means not belittling oneself on the one hand, and not being arrogantly self-aggrandizing on the other. The meaning is very profound. There are many reasons for the decline of the Chinese nation, physical education being one of them, while the shallowness of knowledge and the decline of morality also have an indirect impact. If we want to solve the problem of physical education in China, we should not only seek it in a narrow sense. What Mr. Sun Yat-sen told us, we should know what to uphold in order to resolve this contradictory phenomenon. Cultural conflict and contradictory phenomena are unavoidable in the course of cultural development, and it is our responsibility to resolve these contradictory phenomena. This is what I would like to ask all experts and representatives to pay attention to. China has always attached importance to physical education, but its methods are different from what is being promoted now. We should seek to promote it on the basis of not belittling ourselves and not being arrogantly self-aggrandizing. All Chinese academic and cultural fields should seek solutions on the same basis, including medicine, art, and physical education.</p>
<p>Today, I saw Mr. Chu Minyi's article. Mr. Chu's point of view is based on French and Italian taijiquan movements. I would also like to ask Mr. Zhang Zhijiang, who emphasizes national martial arts movements, to note that national martial arts movements and physical education are parallel and not contradictory. We feel that Western sports are suitable for group life, and through group life, group sports occur, and from group sports, the moral and intellectual education of the people is developed. This kind of sport is suitable for urban life. Most Chinese people live in rural areas and enjoy the beauty of nature. From my personal observation, these economic conditions are very important. For example, in the case of playing tennis, the tennis racket alone costs more than six yuan, and the tennis ball costs several yuan, so it costs at least a dozen yuan to play. If economic conditions cannot be solved, physical education can only be exclusive to schools and can only be enjoyed by the bourgeoisie. How can we make valuable things cheaper and complex things simpler, so that sports are not unique to urban areas but are popularized in rural areas, and seek progress in physical education in ordinary ways? This is also what I hope will be noted at the conference.</p>
<p>A country and a nation can stand in the world only if they have unique qualities. It is a disgrace that we are good at physical education but only know how to imitate and cannot create. Under the current economic conditions in China, it is very necessary to invent a new sport to express the national spirit. This is also what I hope the conference will pay attention to and resolve. For example, English football and American baseball are popular all over the country and can well express the national spirit of their countries. In China, which practices the Three Principles of the People, how should we create new physical education sports to promote the Chinese national spirit? It seems that this is a valuable issue to pay attention to. A month ago, the Chinese representatives were completely defeated at the World Games. This is not shameful. What is shameful is that there is no creation or promotion of the national spirit. Independent creation. Great Chinese people should create a sport for people from other countries to imitate. We should not specialize in following in the footsteps of foreigners. This is the expression of the spirit of national self-confidence. I hope everyone at the conference will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, physical education is not something that can be achieved with mere empty words. We should move from knowing to doing. After everyone has formulated a good implementation plan, we should work hard to promote it, spread it throughout the country, and seek practical results. This is also what I hope from all the gentlemen at the conference.</p>
<p>In summary, what I, representing the central government, hope from the conference is: First, to integrate the strengths of Chinese and Western physical education with the spirit of national self-confidence, not belittling oneself or being arrogantly self-aggrandizing, and to formulate a plan suitable for the economic environment in China; Second, to develop physical education in an ordinary and simple way; Third, in order to seek national survival, we must have great creations to contribute to the world and build a unique new physical education plan for the Chinese nation; Fourth, from today onwards, we hope that the results of the National Physical Education Conference will be earnestly implemented.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin's Speech on Behalf of the National Government</h3>
<p>▲Formulate a Universal Plan Suitable for National Conditions</p>
<p>▲Eliminate Bad Habits that Hinder Physical Education</p>
<p>▲The Formulated Plan Should Be Simple and Practical</p>
<p>Today, I am very honored to represent the National Government and say a few words at the National Physical Education Conference. The World Games have just concluded in Los Angeles, USA. All the larger countries in the world had representatives in attendance, and they were all able to showcase their unique strengths. The Chinese delegation only had two representatives, and they did not even make it to the finals. This shows that the Chinese nation has always not paid attention to physical education, and this has reached an extreme. Originally, the purpose of physical education was not to win medals, but sports are a type of physical education that has the effect of increasing physical and mental strength. In ancient Chinese education, rites, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and arithmetic were called the six arts, and archery was a matter of physical education. Schools were established to teach it, but later generations did not pay attention to it and became increasingly degenerate. If we want to seek the revival of the Chinese nation, there are many methods, but it can be said that we should start with physical education.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen said just now that Chinese people have two contradictory phenomena: on the one hand, they preserve the national essence, and on the other hand, they admire Western culture. Both are biased. I hope that all representatives and experts will pay attention to this. Chinese martial arts and various foreign sports each have their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, they emphasize aesthetics and the development of only a part of the body. Gymnastics in various countries is almost focused on the fingers, or on the limbs, all of which are shortcomings.</p>
<p>Formulating a plan that integrates Chinese and Western physical education is what I hope from the conference. Chinese martial arts focus on individual sports, and there are very few that implement team sports. This shortcoming should be supplemented, and efforts should be made to make national physical education disciplined and universal. The formulation of this plan is what I hope from all the gentlemen.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must eliminate bad habits and bad addictions. These have a huge impact on Chinese physical education. We must eliminate the bad habits of young people, such as smoking, drinking, and gambling. Students in Chinese schools at all levels are unwilling to wear shorts, and women in remote villages still have bound feet. Women in cities do not bind their feet, but they bind their breasts, all of which hinder physical development. The prohibition of these negative aspects is also what I hope the conference will pay attention to. In the neighboring country of Japan, two or thirty years ago, people were short and small, and they were ashamed of it. They paid attention to the promotion of physical education and the elimination of bad habits. Male and female students are required to wear shorts. As a result, the height of the people in their country has increased year by year. In the past thirty years, the average increase has been one inch. This is related to physical development. I hope the conference will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Since the National Government established its capital, many conferences have been held, and there have been many conference proposals. The spirit is very good, but they end up being put on the shelf. This is the first time for a plenary conference on matters related to national survival. It is very important. I hope that everyone will formulate a simple and practical plan that is in line with economic conditions and other factors. A plan, no matter how good, is useless if it cannot be implemented. This plan should also be permanent. We should strive for it to be discussed and feasible. When I was in the Training Supervision Department, I formulated a military education plan, but although the government issued an order for its implementation, very few were able to actually implement it. After the conference is over, how can we supervise and promote its implementation? I hope everyone will pay attention to this. There are very few physical education instructors in China. I personally want to run a model physical education school in the central government, and the gentlemen also have this proposal. I hope it can be put into practice.</p>
<p>Today, I have said a total of three points: First, to formulate a universal physical education plan suitable for national conditions; Second, to eliminate bad habits that hinder physical education; Third, to formulate a simple and feasible plan. That's all.</p>

<h3>Peng Xuepei's Speech on Behalf of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>▲Chinese Physical Education is Heading Towards Suicide</p>
<p>▲Promotion Requires Universal Facilities Like Mahjong</p>
<p>Today, I represent the Executive Yuan in welcoming everyone. Just now, I heard Mr. He Jingzhi say that the Japanese in the neighboring country are short, and their achievements in the World Games are very good. We feel very ashamed. I say that shame is not limited to this. There is something even more shameful, such as the spread of cholera, which is only prevalent in China. This is due to the lack of physical education knowledge among the Chinese people. Chinese people harm their bodies every day and head towards suicide every day. For example, they are unwilling to get vaccinations that cost very little, but they have to buy coffins that cost dozens of yuan. It is very hateful. The need to pay attention to physical education knowledge is the most urgent task today. Chinese people often do not pay attention to physical education after leaving school until they reach the age of thirty. Mr. Chen Lifu said that economic conditions are certainly a major reason, but the lack of active promotion is also a reason. Chinese people usually do not pay attention to various physical education sports, but there are also those who pay attention, namely mahjong. That is why I think that if someone promotes various physical education sports and the facilities for physical education venues throughout the country are as widespread as mahjong, then physical education will naturally develop. In addition, there should be enthusiastic physical educators who practice it and promote it. This is what I hope the gentlemen at the conference will vigorously promote.</p>
<h3>—Record of the First General Assembly—</h3>
<p>▲Zhang Zhijiang Elected as Vice President</p>
<p>—Yuan Dunli Reports on the Draft Plan</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the opening ceremony, the first general assembly commenced at 10:00 AM. A total of 107 members were present. Chu Minyi served as chairman, and Zhang Wei Gao and Huang Wenqi served as recorders. The proceedings were conducted with due formality.</p>
<p>(1) Determining Member Seating</p>
<p>The assigned seating numbers ranged from number 10 to number 121.</p>
<p>(2) Election of Vice Speaker</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang was elected as Vice Speaker with 29 votes. The next highest vote counts were as follows: Yuan Dunli with 25 votes; Hao Gengsheng and Shao Rugan each with 15 votes; Wu Yunrui, Zhang Xinfu, Jin Zhaojun, Du Tingxiu, and Wu Bangwei each receiving 2 votes; and 14 others receiving 1 vote each.</p>
<p>(3) Report by Yuan Dunli</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan reported on the process of drafting the "National Physical Education Implementation Plan" as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education appointed myself and Messrs. Hao Gengsheng and Wu Yunrui to compile this draft, a decision made during the preparatory meeting on June 17th. The draft was completed before July 1st. As the three of us were in Beiping at the time, we also invited figures from the northern sports community to discuss it together. By August 1st, it was sent to the Ministry of Education. Regarding the content, the first section, the introduction, is based on understanding the question of what physical education is, which is very important. The second, objectives, sets the direction. The third, administration and facilities, takes into account that China's physical education administrative system is not as complete as that of European and American countries, and this chapter particularly focuses on this point in order to improve it. The fourth, methods of promoting physical education, emphasizes five points: (1) research work, (2) cultivation of talent, (3) standards for physical education implementation, (4) promotion and encouragement of various physical education gatherings and organizations, (5) methods for evaluating physical education achievements. The fifth, a phased implementation plan, is necessary because the proposed plan cannot be fully implemented all at once and must be phased in. The drafted plan still has many omissions. It is hoped that the results obtained from this meeting will be appropriately supplemented into this plan to strive for perfection. Also, when the review committee convenes, although it will be divided into five groups, everyone is requested to, on the one hand, base their efforts on the essence of the proposals and, on the other hand, incorporate them into the implementation plan so that ideals and reality can coexist without contradiction. Furthermore, although the three of us are nominally responsible for drafting this plan, there are actually many educators and physical educators helping out. I especially wish to express my gratitude.</p>

Guests including Wu Zhihui, He Yingqin, and Peng Xuepei, as well as all members, attended. After a few rounds of drinks, Zhu said, "Although there are no statistics on the weakness and mortality rate of the Chinese nation, it is generally less than forty years old, while in the UK and the US it is around fifty. Therefore, if we want to revive the nation, we must pay attention to the universal development of the nation's physique. Everyone has come from afar, braving the heat, to create a physical education plan suitable for the Chinese nation, which is indeed a precursor to the nation's revival." Yuan Dunli then replied, saying that the government, in order to fundamentally develop national physical education, invited physical education experts and experienced physical education associations to Nanjing to discuss and promote the national physical education plan, changing the government's long-standing policy of promoting it only on paper. This is truly the brightest thing in the history of Chinese physical education. He expressed his gratitude for the excellent hospitality extended to the attendees and felt unworthy of it. Wu Zhihui spoke about the harmony of physical education, considering the problems of food and lodging; being able to eat and sleep, and having a healthy physique, can ensure peace of mind. Ma Liang added that physical education includes the five characters of eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, and sleeping, which can encompass everything.

<h3>Snippets from the Conference Venue</h3>
<p>▲The Detestable Airplane</p>
<p>The venue is close to the airport, and airplanes taking off and landing must pass over the roof of the meeting hall. The sound of the engines is deafening and annoying.

The entire venue was silent, and it took several minutes before they could continue. All the members found the airplanes detestable.</p>
<p>▲Special Paper Fans</p>
<p>The weather is hot, and the venue lacks electric fans. Yesterday, attendees were constantly fanning themselves, mostly with paper fans. Hao Gengsheng held a palm-leaf fan, while a certain martial arts expert used a Kongming-style goose feather fan. Those who did not bring fans used the conference daily or the special publication of the Diligence Bookstore as fans, which were special paper fans.</p>
<p>▲Artistic Slogans</p>
<p>There are only four slogans in the venue: (1) Strengthen the body and the race; (2) Physical education saves the nation; (3) Establish oneself and others; (4) Revolutionize the self and the heart. Each slogan is surrounded by colorful floral borders, making them beautiful and pleasing to the eye. In addition, the Lizhi Society's ten principles of abstinence slogans are hung high on the wall. No one smoked during the many hours of the meeting, which is also influenced by the ten principles of abstinence.</p>
<p>▲Clothing Statistics</p>
<p>Among the 103 members who attended the opening ceremony, apart from four in military uniform, five women, and one in student uniform, 63 were wearing Western suits and 29 were wearing traditional Chinese gowns.</p>
<h3>All Sorts of Conference Items</h3>
<p>▲Yu Binqi Requests Attention to Swimming</p>
<p>Yu Binqi, Wang Jianxin, Hong Zunsan, and Wu Boqing, who are passionate about swimming, suggest that the National Physical Education Conference pay attention to the promotion of swimming, given the immaturity of swimming in China and the value of swimming.</p>
<h3>China Youth Open Swimming Competition</h3>
<p>▲Registration Deadline is Only Two Days</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei and Song Ziwen Return to Beijing by Plane This Morning</h3>
<p>Wang Will Go to Lushan After Attending the Central Political Conference</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Expresses Determination Not to Assume the Position of President of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Standing Committee's discussion meeting a few days ago proposed a solution to Wang Jingwei and Zhang Xueliang's resignations, the rapidly changing political situation seems to have come to an end. Wang is scheduled to take a plane to Beijing with Song Ziwen at six o'clock this morning to attend the Central Political Conference and report the reasons for his resignation, then proceed to Lushan to meet with Lin and Jiang. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Guests Visiting Wang Jingwei Mr. Wang Jingwei seemed to be staying at his residence on West Pubushi Road the night before. At 8:20 in the morning, Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing and went straight to Wang's residence to meet with him. At 9:30, Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Conference, also arrived. Gu and Tang left together at 10:50. Shortly after, Wang, accompanied by his wife Ms. Chen Bijun, left the residence in car number 778. It was said that they were visiting Mr. Cai Yuanpei. Wang did not return to his residence until after 2:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, former Minister of Transportation Chen Mingshu and Chief of Training Li Jishen came to visit and talked for an hour, leaving together at 4:15. Shortly after, Tang Youren returned to Wang's residence and left after a short while.</p>
<p>▲ Wang Meets with Cai Yuanpei A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with Wang when he went out to visit Cai. According to his statement to the reporter, "I am going out at this time to visit Mr. Cai Zimin and discuss the successor to the position of President of the Executive Yuan. I am asking Cai to take on the difficult task, and I am determined not to resume the position of President of the Executive Yuan." However, the reporter followed to Cai's residence and the Academia Sinica, but Wang did not go to either place. Later, Wang met with Mr. Cai in the evening.</p>
<p>▲ Chen and Li Visit Wang Yesterday afternoon at 3:30, Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen went to West Pubushi Road to visit Wang, talking until 4:15 before leaving together. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency asked Chen when he would be going abroad, and he replied that he was not going. He continued, "The visit to Wang was just a casual meeting, nothing important." Then, when asked about Li's departure date for Beijing, he replied that it was not yet determined. "Mr. Wang is returning to Beijing tonight, but I (Li referring to himself) am not going with him." The content of Chen and Li's meeting with Wang seemed inconvenient to disclose. After the reporter finished talking, they hurriedly got into a car and returned to their residence separately. Later, according to news from Wang's residence, the conversation between Chen and Li mainly concerned Wang's trip to Lushan and the issue of the successor to the position of President of the Executive Yuan, which was discussed casually and was not of great importance.</p>
<p>▲ Conversation with a Certain Central Committee Member Regarding Wang's return to Beijing, according to a certain Central Committee member, it has been agreed upon, but the matter of resuming the position of President of the Executive Yuan is still under discussion. Regarding the so-called revision of the government organization, some Central Committee members strongly advocated expanding the powers of the Executive Yuan at the Fourth National Congress, making it superior to the other Yuan, so that the President of the Executive Yuan would have the nature of a responsible cabinet, which is the current system. Now it is heard that some Central Committee members have recently advocated reducing the powers of the Executive Yuan and restoring the organization before the Fourth National Congress, completely entrusting political power to the Central Political Conference, and the powers of the five Yuan would be completely subject to the control of the Political Conference. In this case, Wang, as one of the three Standing Committee members, can still develop his ambitions upon returning to Beijing. In the future, if anyone steps down from the position of President of the Executive Yuan, the ministers would not necessarily have to resign jointly. This is said to be favored by some people. As for this revision of the government organization, it must wait until the Third Plenary Session to be decided. Those who are trying to persuade Wang to stay again pleaded with Wang yesterday to temporarily maintain the affairs of the Executive Yuan until the Third Plenary Session is convened and he resigns, and said that since Zhang Xueliang has already been dismissed, the proposition has already been fulfilled, so there is no need to be stubborn again, causing the political hub to be interrupted. It is heard that Wang said that the wording of his previous telegrams must be taken into account, and he is not deliberately trying to get rid of politics. If it can be within the limits of not violating his previous words, he should be able to accommodate the great kindness of all parties to retain him. As for the matter of resuming the position of President of the Executive Yuan, those who are trying to persuade him to stay are planning to issue a statement that takes into account his previous words, so that the people of the country will know that Wang's temporary expression of resignation was actually to implement the proposal to dismiss Zhang, and there are no other hidden intentions.</p>
<p>▲ Cai Yuanpei's Speech A reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, yesterday and conducted the following interview: (Question) After Mr. Wang firmly resigned as President of the Executive Yuan, he strongly recommended you to take the position. It is also heard that Mr. Wang met with you once yesterday morning (the 15th). I wonder what your intentions are? (Answer) I always hope that Mr. Wang can resume his position. I really cannot take the position. (Question) At this time of national crisis, and you are also highly regarded by the public, it seems that you cannot be too modest. (Answer) In times of national crisis, we should work together, but we should also work hard to the best of our abilities. My inability to serve as President of the Executive Yuan is the same as my inability to fight against Japan like Ma Zhanshan and Cai Tingkai. (Question) If Mr. Wang is determined not to return to the position of President of the Executive Yuan, in your opinion, who would be the most suitable person? (Answer) I think Vice President Song is the most suitable, because the position of Vice President of the Executive Yuan is established by law, precisely to perform duties on behalf of the President of the Executive Yuan when he is absent. And if he is promoted directly this time, he will be familiar with the work. In addition, Minister of the Interior Huang Shaoxiong is also a very suitable person. (Question) Mr. Tang Youren visited Mr. Cai today. Can we hear about it? (Answer) It was not for Mr. Wang's matter. It was to discuss the issue of Zhongda (Central University), because the issue of the collective resignation of Central University needs to be resolved in tomorrow's Central Political Conference. (Question) When will you return to Beijing? (Answer) I still need to continue discussing the Zhongda issue with Mr. Yang Xingfo, so I will not go to Beijing for the time being.</p>
<p>▲ Gu Mengyu's Remarks Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu took the night train to Beijing last night at 11:00 PM. A reporter from this newspaper interviewed Gu on the train last night. According to him, Mr. Wang originally planned to go to Beijing together tonight (i.e., last night), but due to some matters, he will depart tomorrow (i.e., today) to attend the Central Political Conference and report the reasons for his resignation. Then, he will go to Lushan in the middle of this week to meet with Chairman Lin and Military Affairs Committee Chairman Jiang to discuss future national plans. However, Wang has expressed a firm attitude not to resume the position of President of the Executive Yuan. As for the successor, it is estimated that it will be decided after the meeting between Lin, Jiang, and Wang in Lushan.</p>
<p>▲ Wang and Song Fly to Beijing According to reliable sources, Wang Jingwei has decided to take a Sikorsky plane to Beijing with Song Ziwen at 6:00 AM this morning to attend this morning's Central Political Conference. The Sikorsky plane has been repaired and is parked at the Hongqiao Airport waiting for orders. In addition, Song's personal luggage and servants have already taken the night train to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Cross the Border to Demonstrate, City Government Protests to the Japanese Consul Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the incident a few days ago where dozens of Japanese Marines drove more than ten armored vehicles to the Jiangwan Sports Association Road area to demonstrate, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has investigated and reported the details to the City Government. According to Secretary-General Yu Hongjun yesterday, the City Government has protested to the Japanese Consul in a letter at 5:00 PM yesterday regarding such actions by the Japanese military, requesting the Japanese authorities to prevent Japanese troops from crossing the border in the future to avoid unfortunate incidents.</p>
<h3>Problems with the Draft Agreement on Building Roads Beyond the Border</h3>
<p>▲ The Bureau of Public Works Has Full Power to Negotiate</p>
<p>▲ Not Subject to Interference from the Consular Body</p>
<p>According to the Dalu News, regarding the draft agreement on building roads beyond the border, a reporter from the Dalu News learned three important pieces of news yesterday (the 15th) from responsible sources: (1) The Consular Body has replied to the Bureau of Public Works that it has received the draft agreement and has distributed it to the consuls. It is heard that the reply from the Consular Body did not include any opinions. (2) It is claimed that the Consular Body believes that the acceptance of the draft agreement should be decided by the Bureau of Public Works because the agreement does not conflict with the Yangjingbang Regulations or change the status of the International Settlement. (3) Sending the draft agreement to the Consular Body is only for notification and not to ask the Consular Body to take any action. Yesterday, the reporter from the Dalu News visited various consuls, but they all refused to discuss the matter or disclose the content of the draft agreement, only stating that they had received the draft agreement. According to the current situation, some consuls in the Consular Body are not in Shanghai. Therefore, if the Consular Body wants to jointly discuss the agreement, it will likely have to wait until next month. However, based on the news obtained by the reporter from the Dalu News yesterday, it can be interpreted that, with regard to the International Settlement, the Bureau of Public Works has full power to negotiate with the Shanghai local officials on building roads beyond the border and is not subject to interference from the Consular Body, as long as the Yangjingbang Regulations are not modified. Moreover, according to the person who revealed this news yesterday, when the Bureau of Public Works and the Shanghai Municipal Government agreed on the garbage issue a few days ago, it was not necessary to consult with the Consular Body or seek its approval. The issue of building roads beyond the border is the same in principle, so it does not seem necessary to consult with the Consular Body or request its approval. If the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Bureau of Public Works are consulting and resolving an important issue for the benefit of the public, why should the Consular Body interfere? Based on this, and considering the recent actions of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Bureau of Public Works, and the fact that the Consular Body does not seem likely to interfere, the date of its establishment and implementation should not be far off.</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Still Pour into Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Yangtze River Japanese Ships Do Not Charge Third-Class Fares</p>
<p>Japanese goods continue to pour into Shanghai unabated these days. Yesterday, the Japanese ship Kasado Maru arrived in Shanghai with 13,543 pieces of Japanese goods, mainly textiles, silk fabrics, rubber products, stone powder, medicinal materials, and matchstick raw materials. There were also 1,600 bags of Eastern sugar and more than 400 pieces of gauze, which were transferred to Hankou. These inferior goods were all unloaded in Shanghai. The Japanese ship Ikoma Maru also arrived with more than 10,000 pieces of inferior goods, which were also unloaded at the Mitsubishi and Huishan wharves.</p>
<p>It has been more than half a year since Chinese people have taken Japanese ships on the Yangtze River. In order to revive business, the Japanese are advocating free rides. This time, a certain Japanese ship went downstream from Hankou and has implemented a policy of not charging third-class passengers for fares in Hankou, Jiujiang, and other places. Therefore, the first group of third-class passengers who took a free ride on a Japanese ship to the east numbered more than 600.</p>
<h3>Commissioner Jin Arrives in Songhu to Take Office</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Military Affairs dispatched Jin Zhishang, an official of the ministry, to take over as the commissioner in charge of the Wusong Fortress Battery, Jin had previously come to Shanghai to negotiate the takeover and personally inspected the Wusong and Shizilin Second Batteries. He then returned to Beijing to report everything. It is now learned that Jin arrived in Shanghai on the night train the day before yesterday and immediately went to Songhu to take up his position as commissioner. He is currently actively organizing.</p>
<h3>Dai Ji Has Resumed Normal Office</h3>
<p>Dai Ji, commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, had repeatedly requested the Central Military Commission to resign due to illness, but he was earnestly persuaded to stay. Commander Dai went to Wuhan at the end of last month to meet with Chairman Chiang and personally tendered his resignation. He was again earnestly persuaded to stay by Chiang. Commander Dai, moved by Chiang's sincere words, agreed to withdraw his resignation and has been working at the Garrison Command as usual since the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends a Large Number of Police to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Adding Ordinary, Special High, and Mobile Teams of Foreign Affairs Police</p>
<p>After the end of the war and the withdrawal of Japanese troops, in addition to increasing the Marine Corps to 2,800 in Shanghai, the Japanese also used the excuse that Shanghai is an international commercial center to increase the strength of protecting Japanese residents, transferred a large number of water police officers from Japan to Shanghai, expanded their police organization, and added various titles such as special high police teams, ordinary police teams, and mobile police teams. They are already in the process of organizing. The details are being investigated and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Expanding the Ordinary Police Team The Shanghai Japanese Consulate has an existing team of Japanese police, which is now considered weak. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has specially transferred about 40 water police officers from Japan to Shanghai to be incorporated into the ordinary police team to expand its strength. This ordinary police force is under the jurisdiction of the police department of the Japanese Consulate. The Japanese government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has specially transferred Mizo Misa, police chief of Mie Prefecture, to Shanghai as the head of the police department to command the ordinary police. He has been notified to come to Shanghai to take office immediately.</p>
<p>▲ Adding the Special High Police Team The Japanese claim that Shanghai is the birthplace of various ideologies and that unfortunate incidents occur from time to time. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a special high police team to specialize in preventing and investigating the intrusion of various international incidents. This special high police team has a quota of 40 people, and it can be increased if the work is busy. In the past three months, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has transferred 60 to 70 water police officers from Moji, Nagoya, Kobe, and other places to Shanghai to serve as special high police officers. They have all arrived. The special high police are also attached to the Japanese Consulate and managed by a police inspector section established by the Consulate. The special high police will submit the obtained affairs to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review every week.</p>
<p>▲ Adding the Mobile Police Team In addition to the special high and ordinary police teams, a mobile police force has also been added. This mobile police force has a larger scope. Whenever there are matters to be dispatched from Shanghai to various places along the Yangtze River, they can go to serve and are not limited to one place, but can be assigned at any time. Therefore, it is named the Mobile Police Team. Yesterday, the Japanese government dispatched police officers Yoshiga Yukio, Suenaga Junko, Kimori Heiichi, Motoyama Kazutsugu, Ohara Fumitake, etc. from Japan to Shanghai to report to the Japanese Consulate and start organizing this mobile police team.</p>
<p>▲ Dispatching More Foreign Affairs Police The Japanese government also regards Hankou, in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, as an important area. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also specially dispatched police officers Oichishi Ichiro and Kawashima Eizo from Japan to Shanghai and transferred them to the Japanese Consulate in Hankou to serve as foreign affairs police. They will leave Shanghai today and go west to Hankou.</p>
<h3>Northeast National Salvation Army Sends Telegram Requesting Assistance</h3>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram yesterday from Zhou Han, commander of the 5th Route of the Northeast National Salvation Army: (Greetings omitted) "Since our department was inspected, with thousands of troops, the daily food and supplies are not cheap. Previously, the leaders were responsible for borrowing and the local government was making transfers, but this is not a long-term solution. We are grateful that your office promised to be fully responsible for the inspection and sufficient support after the inspection, but we have not received a single penny to date, which has put my younger brother in a very difficult situation. If this continues to be delayed, it will be in danger. Currently, the Japanese bandits are specializing in searching for the leaders of the volunteer army and offering rewards of 30,000 to 50,000, which is deeply lamentable that a few traitors are being used by them. The generals at the front are in danger every day. If we do not provide assistance soon, they may be wiped out. If we continue to rely on the volunteer army to resist and contain the enemy in the interior, it will be too late to regret. In this case, not only will it be difficult to recover the lost territory in the Northeast, but the future of the country is also unimaginable. The situation is becoming increasingly tense. What should we do? We hope to receive a reply soon. With special respect, Commander Zhou Han of the 5th Route of the Northeast National Salvation Army."</p>

<h3>Measures for Reducing or Exempting Housing Taxes in War Zones</h3>
<p>▲ Proclamation on Reducing Taxes in the Autumn Tax Collection</p>
<p>Cai Zengji, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, issued a proclamation yesterday, stating: "For the purpose of proclamation, it has been investigated and found that, according to the order of the Municipal Government, the housing tax for one month in the Southern Shanghai District and the area north of the Suzhou Creek in the Pujiang-Songjiang District has been reduced or exempted. A proclamation has been issued to reduce the tax in this year's autumn housing tax in the relevant districts. Now, the original tax bills have been reprinted in red, with the words 'Order to reduce or exempt the housing tax for one month and reduce it in the autumn tax collection. Therefore, in this quarter's housing tax, two-thirds of the original tax amount will be collected.' Also, under the amount of autumn housing tax payable, fill in two-thirds of the actual amount collected (for example, if the original tax is 3 yuan, fill in 2 yuan) to make it easy to understand and avoid malpractices. In addition to submitting a report for record and ordering the relevant tax collection offices to comply and implement, this proclamation is issued for general knowledge."</p>
<h3>Housing Rent Arbitration Committee Studies Standards for Handling Disputes</h3>
<p>▲ Based on Previous Housing Lease Rules</p>
<p>▲ First, Invite Committee Members to Participate and Provide Opinions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Housing Rent Arbitration Committee has recently faced many housing rent disputes and lacks handling standards, which has caused difficulties. Therefore, it is proposed to formulate lease rules to serve as a guideline. It has recently been heard that, after deliberation by the committee, important articles from the Shanghai Municipal Government's Housing Lease Rules have been extracted and committee members will be invited to participate and discuss them. The committee notified all members yesterday, requesting that they submit their opinions to the committee by the 25th of this month to facilitate discussion.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Exchange Bureau of the Central Bank</h3>
<p>The Central Bank established the Exchange Bureau, and held an inauguration ceremony at 8:30 yesterday morning. Directors Ye Zhuotang, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Baolun, Zhou Zongliang, Tang Shoumin, and Chen Xing, supervisors He De, Qin Runqing, and Lin Kanghou, and all employees and many guests attended. President Song Ziwen was unable to attend due to other matters, and Vice President Chen Xing delivered a speech on his behalf, stating: "Today, the establishment of the Exchange Bureau of this bank is a memorable event in the development history of this bank. Back in the spring of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], the government ordered the collection of tariff gold, and in order to meet the needs, this bank specially added a tariff gold exchange section to the business bureau to specialize in this matter. Manager Xi, who was then Deputy Director of the Issuance Bureau, knew that he had rich experience in foreign exchange business. Therefore, he was transferred to Deputy Manager of the Business Bureau to preside over the tariff gold exchange matters. In the past two years, the achievements have been remarkable, and the affairs of the section have become increasingly complex, to the point where it has recently become necessary to establish a bureau. Therefore, it was specially proposed and approved by the Executive Yuan to establish the Exchange Bureau, which, together with the Business and Issuance Bureaus, will be the three bureaus, and Mr. Xi will still be the General Manager. I am deeply convinced that Mr. Xi will be able to handle the work with ease and competence, and I hope that he will still adhere to the principles of this bank and work hard to move forward. This bank will have a brighter future. As for the establishment of the Exchange Bureau, although the organization has been slightly expanded, the various bureaus and offices should still cooperate and work together in harmony. The colleagues of the Exchange Bureau should especially listen to the command of General Manager Xi and work harder. There are high hopes for them." Then, Xi Demao, General Manager of the Exchange Bureau, delivered a reply. The ceremony concluded at 9:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Aviation Association Plans to Establish a Fujian Branch</h3>
<p>▲ Sending a Letter Requesting Cooperation from Mr. Chen Wenlin</p>
<p>The China Aviation Construction Association previously sent a representative, Mr. Lin Jiyong, to Fujian to contact various circles and prepare for the establishment of a branch in Fujian. According to a letter from Representative Lin, Chen Wenlin, Director of the Fujian Aviation Office, has recently initiated the Fujian Aviation Construction Association, with the same purpose. It is necessary to cooperate. He also said that he had considerable contact with Director Chen. The association immediately replied, instructing Representative Lin to make efforts to contact and achieve the purpose of division of labor and cooperation, and to establish the Fujian Aviation Construction Association as the branch of the association in Fujian. This matter will be realized soon.</p>
<h3>The Impact of Price Conversion on Citizens' Lives After the Abolition of Tael and Introduction of Yuan</h3>
<p>▲ If the Conversion Ratio Is Stipulated at a Low Rate</p>
<p>▲ Then Citizens Will Suffer Permanent and Immense Losses</p>
<p>The matter of abolishing the tael and introducing the yuan seems to have been suspended recently due to the political situation, but in fact, all preparations have been completed and can be announced and implemented as soon as the central government makes a decision. The Committee for Researching the Abolition of Tael and Introduction of Yuan, organized by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, has held two meetings to collect opinions from various industries and regions. It is now scheduled to convene a third meeting on the 22nd to decide on a draft plan with concrete measures on the fineness, weight, exchange rate of taels to yuan, and subsequent financial arrangements. In addition, Zhu Yucang, a citizen, sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and other organizations, expressing his views on the impact of the price conversion problem on citizens' lives. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Summary of Opinions from Various Industries The Committee for Researching the Abolition of Tael and Introduction of Yuan of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in accordance with the resolution of the second meeting of the Committee for Researching the Abolition of Tael and Introduction of Yuan, summarized the opinions submitted by various parties up to August 10, as follows: (1) Regarding the first point, in addition to advocating the Republican Third System, most of them pay attention to meeting the current needs and ensuring that the weight and fineness of the new currency are not too high or too low, or abnormally light or heavy. Old and mixed-color silver coins should be gradually withdrawn, and open inspection and supervision are essential procedures. (2) Regarding the second point, most believe that the circumstances of silver dollar contracts vary from place to place and should be decided by legal groups, together with various industries and creditors and debtors, through public discussion to determine a compromise solution. (3) Regarding the third point, most believe that the issuance of soft currency must have unified measures, and the preparation of cash must be at least 60%, and other debts must not be used as collateral. Moreover, it must be publicly inspected at any time.</p>
<p>▲ Price Conversion Affects Life Citizen Zhu Yucang sent a letter to various organizations, stating: "Greetings. The second of the three issues to be discussed by the Committee for Abolishing Tael and Introducing Yuan is the conversion ratio between silver taels and silver dollars. This issue is directly related to the lives of the three million citizens of Shanghai, namely the following items: (1) Electricity fees; (2) Telephone fees; (3) Land rent; (4) Water fees; (5) Rent, etc. Most of these are paid in silver taels, so they are related to the tael-yuan conversion ratio at the time of the abolition of taels. The difference between the highest and lowest exchange rates of silver dollars this year is 7 jiao and 3 fen and 6 jiao and 8 fen and 8 li, respectively (note that it recently fell within 7 fen). The difference per yuan is more than 4 fen and 2 li. If calculated according to the high rate, each tael of silver is only worth 1 yuan, 3 jiao, 6 fen, and 9 li in silver dollars. According to the low rate, each tael of silver is worth 1 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen, and 2 li and 6 hao in silver dollars. Therefore, the difference per tael of Quyuan is 8 fen, 3 li, and 6 hao in silver dollars. For ten taels, the difference is 8 jiao, 3 fen, and 6 li in silver dollars. Electricity, telephone, rent, and other fees are continuous and are not like the debts of loans, which can be terminated after one settlement. Moreover, most of the charging agencies in Shanghai are in the hands of foreigners, and most of the payers are Chinese. If the tael-yuan conversion ratio is stipulated at a low rate, citizens will suffer</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>permanent and immense losses, and it will be tantamount to helping foreigners exploit the Chinese people. Instead of arguing after the fact, it is better to plan ahead. Some may ask, what is a fair tael-yuan conversion ratio? I believe that the current number of silver dollars is only a temporary and abnormal phenomenon and cannot be relied upon. The standard for evaluating the tael-yuan conversion ratio should be the silver content and minting costs of each yuan. After all, no one can deny that the silver content of each yuan has a different value from silver taels, and the minting cost is the cost of processing, which should not be removed. Therefore, the following formulas are obtained: (1) Pure silver plus minting cost per yuan equals the amount of silver per yuan; (2) The amount of silver per yuan divided by one tael of silver equals the number of yuan per tael. (The silver content of our country's silver coins varies, so the most widely circulated one should be used.) My humble opinion is that the right-listed ratio is the fair conversion ratio between silver taels and silver dollars. I dare to offer my humble views for your consideration, hoping that your association will consider and adopt them so that citizens can avoid increased burdens in this era of severe economic oppression and reduce disputes. I would be most fortunate."</p>
<h3>Wang Yansong Assumes Directorship of Commodity Exhibition Hall</h3>
<p>▲Mr. Wang's Speech Emphasized Production Improvement</p>
<p>▲As Well as Three Points: Leading by Example and Investing in Factory Establishment</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall has always been dedicated to promoting domestic goods and developing industries. Since its establishment, it has been eleven years. Recently, it expanded its premises and added a domestic goods market, making its operations even more proactive. After the passing of its director, Mr. Ye Huijun, due to illness, the Chamber specially appointed Executive Committee member Mr. Wang Yansong to succeed him. Mr. Wang has consistently spared no effort in advocating for domestic goods and serving society with great enthusiasm. He currently serves as the Chairman and General Manager of the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank and is the founder and manager of the Daxin Silk and Satin Store. Yesterday (August 15th) was Mr. Wang's first day in office. He convened a joint meeting of the hall's staff and the responsible parties of the various manufacturers in the hall's domestic goods market. Over ninety people attended, and they had a lengthy discussion. The following is an excerpt of Mr. Wang's speech: Since I have served as a member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, I have made no significant contributions to various tasks and feel extremely ashamed. Moreover, I find both social work and private business very busy. Now that the gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce have appointed me to concurrently serve as the director of the Exhibition Hall, I feel somewhat inadequate in terms of energy. However, the gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce emphasized the greater good and did not accept my repeated refusals, so I reluctantly accepted the position. Our Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall has been established for eleven years. It is open to the public every day for viewing. Its purpose is to promote domestic goods and prevent financial outflows, carrying a significant mission. However, the promotion of domestic goods has become a warning slogan for over a decade. Our compatriots at least retain some impression in their minds, but the result is still that foreign goods flood the market while domestic goods lag behind. The reason for this is not that our people lack patriotism but that foreign goods are cheap and of high quality, which deeply appeals to the mentality of our people, especially women. Furthermore, the reputation of our country's goods has been lost for a long time, and their actual quality is often inferior to foreign goods, leading to a sharp decline. This can be described as the first matter of great distress. From now on, the manufacturer representatives should strive to improve the manufacturing of goods, the sourcing of raw materials, the selection of quality, the study of decoration, the setting of prices, and the convenience of use. They should quickly seek progress to reverse this decline. They must have a firm and unwavering determination to fight to the end before they can achieve success. Recently, I went to Qingdao with the gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce to investigate commerce. I noticed that Qingdao's efforts to promote domestic goods are far inferior to Shanghai. A manager of a certain cigarette company wears Western suits and consumes imported goods, which can be understood. What is most regrettable is that when he smokes cigarettes, instead of taking from his own factory's products, he buys and smokes foreign cigarettes. This is extremely hateful and shows that the decline of national character has reached its peak. In my opinion, there are only three points to seek the development of domestic goods: (1) Improve production. Our country's domestic goods have always been very rudimentary because there is no long-term research. They only care about immediate small profits, lack a broad vision, and lack a spirit of sacrifice. How can they develop? Those who want domestic goods to develop must first improve their production and be sure to adhere to the principle of truthfulness. They must not have the drawbacks of passing off inferior goods as superior or charging high prices, which hinder the future of domestic goods. This is my first hope. (2) Urge government personnel to lead by example. Since the communists have been rampant, the common people are not at peace, leading to industrial failures and economic bankruptcies. I hope our government will quickly suppress the communists so that industry and commerce can be revived. In the past, the central government stipulated seven local autonomy movements, one of which was the promotion of domestic goods. However, whether government personnel are actually implementing the promotion of domestic goods is something that all our people should pay attention to. They should carefully examine whether what they use is domestic goods, strictly urge them, and even attack them if they do not. Government personnel should lead by example and promote domestic goods to be effective. The best thing is for the government to set up a "Domestic Goods Encouragement Association" to gather broad benefits. This is my second hope. (3) Hope that entrepreneurs will invest in establishing factories. Very few of our country's domestic goods are well-known. Even the silk and tea industries, which have always been famous, as well as one or two recent inventions, are mostly limited by economics and unable to purchase machinery to develop using scientific methods. This leads to domestic goods being permanently in decline. If entrepreneurs can invest heavily in establishing factories, not only will the problem of people's livelihood be solved, but the goods produced will also be very exquisite. Not only will our 400 million compatriots abandon foreign goods and happily use domestic goods, but by extension, it can be popularized worldwide. This is my third hope. In summary, if these three points can be implemented earnestly, it will not be difficult to revitalize domestic goods. I hope that the representatives of this market and the staff of the Exhibition Hall will work together to cooperate and live up to the intention of this Chamber to promote domestic goods, and so on.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation Branch Writes to Various Organizations to Re-examine and Seal Inferior Goods</h3>
<p>The 26th Branch of the Municipal Federation of Citizens' Associations wrote to the General Association of the Municipal Federation of Citizens' Associations and other commercial organizations, stating (excerpt): Unexpectedly, some profit-seeking merchants disregard the nation's pain and transport inferior goods for sale. In recent months, the import of inferior goods has greatly increased. Therefore, patriotism must begin with self-restraint. However, our merchants do not deliberately stock poor-quality goods. Past achievements are considerable. They only need leadership and will undoubtedly comply. Organizational bodies are responsible for leadership and maintenance. They should take into account the personal convenience of member stores and not allow them to be wrongly suppressed. They should conduct a re-examination of inferior goods and promptly seal them. One side should be filed by the various organizations as evidence to demonstrate authenticity. This concerns national salvation and resistance to aggression, an urgent plan that cannot be delayed. We hope that you will discuss, decide, and implement it quickly to avoid disturbances and maintain commerce. We eagerly await your response.</p>
<h3>Japanese Paper Imports Again Occupy the First Place</h3>
<p>▲Paper Industry Association Orders Strict Inspection</p>
<p>Among our country's paper products, Japanese imports have always been the most numerous. This is because there are no large-scale paper mills in the country, and the prices of Swedish, American, German, and British goods are too high. Only Japanese goods have convenient transportation and low prices, so they have been able to dominate and occupy the first place. According to an informal report by the Paper Industry Association last year, Japanese goods accounted for more than eight out of ten parts, which is quite alarming. After the Wanbaoshan Incident occurred, followed by the September 18th Incident and then the January 28th Incident, the Japanese paper industry plummeted. Unexpectedly, recently, Japanese goods have suddenly become extremely active again, not only restoring their original sales but also exceeding their previous position. An investigation by the Paper Industry Association revealed that the paper materials imported last month were entirely Japanese goods, with no room for foreign merchants to intervene. The Paper Industry Association is now seeking remedial measures and has issued an order for inspection teams to intensify their inspections.</p>
<h3>International Trade Association Pays Attention to the Export of Chinese Goods</h3>
<p>▲Goods Must Be Labeled "Made in China"</p>
<p>▲Instructions Must Be Clear and Accurate</p>
<p>The China International Trade Association, in view of the fact that some factories in our country that export goods to foreign countries have not marked the factory name, address, and the words "Made in China" on the packaging and boxes, making them vulnerable to difficulties with foreign customs, and that the product instructions may lack fluency or the wording may be obscure, which hinders sales, specially sent letters to the Joint Association of Mechanical Domestic Goods Factories and the Joint Association of Domestic Goods Factories in this city yesterday, requesting that the above two matters be brought to the attention of the various manufacturers.</p>

<h3>Silk Factories Return to Normal</h3>
<p>▲Turnaround in European and American Sales</p>
<p>There are a total of 113 single and double cocoon silk factories in this city. Previously, due to the sharp decline in the foreign silk market and the plummeting silk prices, many factories suspended operations. Before the summer vacation, only 32 factories in the city were barely operating. Now, with the turnaround in American sales of white silk and the follow-up actions of Britain and France, silk sales have suddenly become smooth. Silk cocoon merchants holding surplus cocoons and the financial sector receiving dry cocoons as collateral have all rented factories to reel silk to meet market demand. As a result, the number of silk factories operating in Shanghai has suddenly increased by 12, bringing the total to 45. As for the 32 silk factories that had reduced their working hours to half a day in the morning due to the implementation of the summer vacation system, they have now resumed full-day work due to the cool autumn weather. As of Monday, all the silk factories operating in the city have returned to their original state before the summer vacation.</p>
<h3>British-Owned Public Bus Labor Strike; Capital's Attitude Strengthens</h3>
<p>▲Actively Recruiting New Workers; Old Workers Will Never Be Hired</p>
<p>▲Disturbances Occur on All Routes; Workers' Internal Division</p>
<p>After the strike by the British-owned public bus company in the Public Concession, the company's attitude has become increasingly tough. Disturbances continue to occur on all bus routes. Striking workers are warning new workers, and internal divisions are occurring among the workers. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Warning New Workers; Factory Director and Traffic Superintendent Datte, in order to vigorously find ways to restore the operation of public buses on all routes, has been posting notices at the company's entrance on Connaught Road since the day before yesterday to recruit new workers. Four qualifications are stipulated, and the applicants are overwhelmingly crowded. More than fifty people were hired the day before yesterday, and more than ten people were hired yesterday. Together with the twenty-five people hired before, they have been personally trained by Assistant Manager Pierre. As soon as the training is completed, they will be assigned to serve on various routes. Striking workers, believing that the recruitment of new workers will affect the future of the strike, warned new workers yesterday not to be deceived by the capitalists and undermine the strike discipline. A striking worker forcibly removed the uniform of a new ticket seller at the company's entrance on Connaught Road.</p>
<p>▲Requesting Protection; The Provisional Strike Committee presented a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs the day before yesterday, painfully describing the company's oppression and requesting that personnel be dispatched quickly to mediate. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Shi Xiaoshan, Zhang Bailing, Huang Xingmao, He Zhanquan, and others were sent to the Municipal Party Headquarters to request that the Public Security Bureau protect the office of the Provisional Strike Committee in the Xinkang Hotel on Connaught Road and provide assistance.</p>
<p>▲Workers Split; The Strike Committee officially announced yesterday: "Today, a small number of workers are using the name of the Strike Committee to call on striking workers to register at the Xinkang Hotel." The Strike Committee, upon learning of this news, immediately sent people to explain to the masses, saying, "We can only achieve victory by unifying the organization and strengthening unity." A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned that the provisional committee at the Xinkang Hotel was actually organized by the six worker representatives appointed by the company who were removed by the Strike Committee's resolution. They are the ones who requested mediation from the party and government agencies.</p>
<p>▲Complete Dismissal; A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited the company's Deputy Traffic Superintendent Charles yesterday and asked about the methods of dealing with the striking workers and the company's policies. He said that all the ticket sellers had not made any demands to the company in advance and suddenly went on strike. When it happened, he was in Japan. Now, the board of directors has resolved to dismiss them all. Moreover, the chairman ordered that when recruiting new workers, no striking workers should be hired. In fact, there is no possibility of recovery. No matter which organization comes forward to mediate, they will only act according to the chairman's orders. If he were in Shanghai, such an unfortunate event would not have occurred. Currently, there is no room for negotiation with the striking workers.</p>
<p>▲Today's Response; The Strike Committee officially announced yesterday: "Today, the company sent 150 'running dogs' to report to the workers, asking them to stop beating White Russians, intercepting cars, etc. A document states that conditions will be answered tomorrow. They also said that if the conditions are not answered tomorrow (i.e., today), they are willing to be severely punished by the masses." The workers all believe that this is a trick to deceive the workers and undermine the strike. The Strike Committee has also notified all workers to gather at the Wuzhen Road Bridge early tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning) to listen to Xu Fu. If the answer is unsatisfactory, they will deal with it together." However, according to inquiries by the New Voice News Agency yesterday, the company denied the matter.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at the Electric Power Company Resolved</h3>
<p>▲Party and Government Agencies Negotiated the Results Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Company Declares Priority Employment of Old Workers</p>
<p>All the workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, because the management did not fulfill its promise to give priority to employing old workers, triggered a major labor dispute. Party and government agencies negotiated with the company yesterday and decided on a solution that the labor union representatives considered satisfactory.</p>
<p>▲Labor and Capital State; Zhu Guilin from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and Zhang Sheng from the Municipal Party Headquarters, together with Wang Zao, the representative of the Shanghai Electric Power Company Labor Union, went to the Electric Power Company on Jiangxi Road at 9:30 AM yesterday to negotiate with the second shift, Hallett. The labor side stated that the company had declared that since the Sino-Japanese War, the number of electricity users had decreased, which greatly affected business. It was unavoidable to lay off workers, but old workers would be given priority for employment in the future. Now, a new worker has been hired at the Fielun Road Old Factory, and the Transportation Department has temporarily hired a temporary worker, which goes against the promise to give priority to employing old workers. They demanded that the company be ordered to fulfill its promise to maintain the livelihoods of unemployed workers. The capital side stated, "The company's dismissal of workers was a last resort. Moreover, the business has not turned around, and it is impossible to hire new workers. The company has inquired at the new and old factories and there is no hiring of new workers. The carpenter at the 达间 is a specialist, and among the more than 120 people laid off, all were incompetent, which is an exception."</p>
<p>▲Solutions; Representatives of the Party and Government Agencies then advised the company's second shift, Hallett, and decided on the following solution: (1) The company solemnly declares that when hiring new workers or temporary workers in the future, old workers will be given priority. (2) If the workers' addresses are unknown, the company will notify the Bureau of Social Affairs to forward them. (3) Specialists, such as coppersmiths and drivers, who are incompetent among the laid-off workers, are exceptions. Thus, the representatives of the Shanghai Electric Power Company Labor Union were satisfied with the solutions decided upon by the Party and Government Agencies.</p>
<h3>Wang Wei'in Cables Yi Peiji to Urge Swift Transfer of Cultural Relics from the Forbidden City</h3>
<p>Director Yi, I respectfully write to you. I have recently read in the local newspapers that you have stated that the cultural relics in the Forbidden City will not be moved but will be stored in a warehouse for protection. I believe this is not a good plan. Therefore, I dare to offer my humble opinion. The violent sun has plotted the invasion of our land most carefully, and its destruction of our national culture is also a predetermined conspiracy. Looking at the Shanghai Incident of January 28th, it wantonly threw bombs and set fires, causing our larger cultural institutions, such as the Commercial Press Library, the Oriental Library, and various public and private universities, to be burned down, and the losses were enormous. Now, they continue to attack and invade. Rehe is in danger, and Tianjin and Beijing are feeling the cold. Given their brutality, we must prepare in advance for avoidance and prevention. Therefore, I would like to urge you to quickly select and move the treasures in the museum to preserve the essence of thousands of years. This is to be prepared for a rainy day, which I believe you will consider. The urgent telegram is pressing, and I am respectfully wishing you good health. Wang Weiyin respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Forces Stationed in Shanghai Held a Memorial Service Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲A Lantern Parade Was Held After 7:00 PM</p>
<p>Sugioka, commander of the Japanese naval landing force stationed in Shanghai, had previously issued an order to all units to hold a memorial service for the naval officers and soldiers who died in the Shanghai War at the Benyuan Temple on Zhabei Road at 1:00 PM yesterday. A lantern parade was also held in the evening. Yesterday afternoon at around 1:00 PM, more than fifty Japanese naval landing force officers from warrant officers down attended the memorial service at the Benyuan Temple. About 200 Japanese people living in Shanghai also attended, and Japanese Consul Murai and others also went to pay their respects. Commander Sugioka also gave an extremely激烈的荒謬之 speech. The area around the Japanese Temple was heavily guarded, and pedestrians passing through the area had to undergo strict inspections. This is because the Japanese side was deeply afraid that anti-Japanese elements would mix in and throw bombs, causing another Hongkou Massacre. The memorial service did not end until 5:00 PM. After 7:00 PM, Japanese residents in Shanghai held a lantern parade.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Various Organizations in Hongkou</h3>
<p>▲Telegraph the National Government to Punish Traitors; Hand Over Power to the People</p>
<p>▲Write to the Court to Release Patriotic Heroes</p>
<p>The Hongkou district branches of the Civil Union and more than 20 groups, including the Hainin Road business community, convened their 20th joint meeting yesterday. More than 20 people attended, and Zhang Xianfang was elected chairman. The following resolutions were passed: (1) To punish the traitor Hu Lifu, a special case should be created in law and the punishment method should be made public to the people to satisfy the public and serve as a warning. The resolution was passed and telegraphed to the National Government for approval. (2) To assist the patriotic hero Yun Huifang, a letter was sent to the court to release him quickly in order to maintain the patriotic movement. Other cases were briefly mentioned. The letters and telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Telegram to the National Government Regarding the Punishment of Traitors; Nanjing National Government, be informed. Japan is invading our territory, and our rivers and mountains are changing color. Although the Japanese army is advancing brutally with violence and warships, they are aided by traitors who are helping them to do evil. Internal spies are running rampant, killing each other, and their consciences are lost. Their viciousness is worse than floods and wild beasts. Even if we eat their flesh and sleep on their skin, it is not enough to appease our anger. The so-called crime is a unique case, and is beyond the scope of national law. As it concerns the state and the same race hastening their own demise, the people should be allowed to govern their own sins. No palace or office should restrain them. The people should organize a public court to punish traitors and impose the death penalty to show the public, punish one to warn others, and serve as an example. It should also be printed in historical records and cast in iron statues, like Qin Hui, to leave a bad name for thousands of years and be permanently remembered. During the recent Shanghai war, Hu Lifu, the leader of the traitors, was captured. He will soon be sent to the capital. Although there is a legal precedent for how to deal with him, it is not satisfying. To satisfy the people, the National Government should order the capture agency to hand him over to the people for their own decision and impose the death penalty as a punishment and a warning to future generations. Eliminating the same kind of scum is a national benefit. We hereby inform you and hope you will investigate it.</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Court Supporting Yun Huifang (titles omitted); The people are saddened by the nation's crisis and want to save the Shenzhou from its demise. National salvation must start with self-help in order to resist foreign aggression. Traitorous merchants seek profit by selling inferior goods and using our country's money to build warships for the enemy to invade our country. If these traitors are not dealt with by the people themselves, what will be the consequences? If patriotic heroes form blood soul groups and other people warn each other, there will be no greater patriotic movement. Yun Huifang's comrades have been working enthusiastically and are admired by the people. Unexpectedly, he was arrested, but it is not beneficial to him. Patriotism comes from a good conscience, and he should not be falsely accused of committing a crime. It is the result of the patriotic blood surging. All nationals should deeply praise and encourage him. If all nationals can imitate Yun's actions, Japan will not dare to invade our country's territory. We hope that you will catch up quickly and give encouragement. We urge the court to exercise its legal authority and quickly acquit Yun and release him to maintain the spirit of patriotism so that patriotic heroes can see the light of day and be inspired to save the country. We rely on this action. We earnestly express our words and await the fair judgment.</p>

<h3>Public Security Bureau Strictly Interrogates Hu Lifu</h3>
<p>▲The Criminal Hu Cries Bitterly</p>
<p>▲No Date Set for Transfer to the Capital</p>
<p>The Zhabei traitor Hu Lifu was transferred to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau by the Detective Team the day before yesterday. This morning, the Director of the Interrogation Division, Ding Zhibai, personally interrogated him from 7:00 AM to 9:30 AM. It was decided that he would be transferred to the capital for punishment within one or two days. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Morning Interrogation; At 7:00 AM, Director Ding ordered the police to bring Hu from the detention center. Out of caution, Director Wen temporarily ordered that no one be allowed to listen in. Secretary Han Bing recorded the interrogation. First, they asked about his age, hometown, and address. Then, they questioned him about his relationship with the Japanese, his collaboration with the enemy, his illegal organization of the Shanghai Local Maintenance Association, his recruitment of fake police, his extortion, his running of gambling dens, and other events. Hu also truthfully stated the facts. His confession was no different from what was reported in the newspapers yesterday and the day before.</p>
<p>▲The Criminal Hu Cried Loudly; When the interrogation was over, Hu also knew that his crime could not be escaped and that national law could not forgive him. He could not help but cry bitterly in court, as if he regretted it. He also requested that a people's court be organized to try him, but Director Ding rejected his request and ordered the police to return Hu to the detention center to await orders from the municipal government. Director Ding then immediately compiled the case files and completed the transfer procedures, awaiting orders from above.</p>
<p>▲Director Wen's Conversation; Public Security Bureau Director Wen visited Mayor Wu yesterday to ask for instructions on the issue of Hu's transfer. According to Director Wen, the traitor Hu may be sent to the capital for strict punishment. However, in his opinion, the traitor Hu's crimes are unforgivable, and the public is even more outraged by him. Although the distance between Beijing and Shanghai is short, he fears that the public will become aware of him en route and an accident will occur. In that case, the traitor may be beaten to death before he can be transferred to the capital.</p>
<p>▲Decision to Transfer to the Capital; At around 10:00 PM last night, this newspaper suddenly received a news item stating, "Hu Lifu was transferred to the capital last night." The reporter was very surprised, feeling that even if the criminal Hu was to be transferred to the capital, the procedures would not be so quick. However, thinking that the case was serious and that a quick transfer was possible, the reporter visited Director Ding of the Judicial Section to verify. According to him, the decision to transfer Hu to the capital was made by Mayor Wu after Director Wen asked for instructions from the municipal government yesterday (August 15th). However, the date of transfer has not yet been determined. At the earliest, it will be in two days (August 18th), and at the latest, it may be a week. There is still a question of whether Hu will be handed over to the Capital Garrison Command or directly to the Ministry of Military Affairs after his transfer to the capital. This point will be decided after Director Wen and Mayor Wu discuss it tomorrow (today). In short, Hu's transfer to the capital has now been decided and there is no problem. However, in recent days, some people have often asked me (Director Ding referring to himself) how I think Hu should be punished. It can be seen that Mayor Wu's decision to transfer him to the capital shows the authorities' attention to this case. Therefore, the result of Hu's case can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Extortion Ring Leader Known for Extravagant Car Rides</h3>
<p>▲ Involved in Kidnapping Yan Weilien, Qian Shanfu, Pu Wenting, etc.</p>
<p>▲ A Handgun and Bank Books Were Seized During the Arrest</p>
<p>▲ Two Accomplices, Zhang Afu and Zhang Jiancheng, Were Subsequently Apprehended</p>
<p>A notorious kidnapping ring leader, Zheng Shifan (also known as Zheng Liantang), a local resident with the nickname "Big Brother," 32 years old, has been arrested. He has committed countless kidnapping cases in Shanghai, commanding a large number of accomplices and possessing substantial wealth. He currently resides in a lavishly decorated Western-style house at No. 9, Lane 601, Route Lafayette in the French Concession, using cars for transportation and displaying an extravagant lifestyle. His neighbors all regarded Zheng as a wealthy merchant or high-ranking official, unaware that he was a major bandit. The case was investigated by Jin Jiulin, a detective inspector from the French Concession Police's special division. It was discovered that Zheng, two years ago, organized a gang to kidnap the wealthy merchant Yan Weilien at the Deyilou Teahouse in the City God Temple, and also kidnapped Qian Shanfu, the owner of Yongfeng Timber Company in Nanshi, at the entrance of Pushi Road in the Concord Neighborhood, and further kidnapped Pu Wenting, a native of Wuxi and manager of the Fuxin No. 5 Flour Mill, whose residence was located at a certain number in Siming Village on Avenue Foch. He extorted huge sums of money as ransom for personal use. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Inspector Jin reported to the Western District Chief, and together with detectives Li Yaolong, Zhang Ziying, and constables Qin Youyu and Liu Dianlong, disguised themselves and drove to make the arrest. Upon reaching the destination, the detectives secured the house's surroundings and front and back doors. Inspector Jin, detectives Li and Zhang, armed with pistols, knocked on the door and entered, rushing upstairs to Zheng's bedroom. Zheng, having heard the mixed footsteps on the stairs, knew something was amiss and was about to resist arrest and attempt to escape, but the detectives had already reached the room. He was unable to react and was captured without resistance. Inside the room, they found a handgun, two bank books—one with a deposit of 2,000 yuan at the Dalu Bank and another with a deposit of 8,000 yuan at the Jin Cheng Bank—all of which were taken to the police station. Zheng confessed to the involvement of his accomplices Zhang Ading, residing at No. 30, the intersection of Route Cardinal Fessard and Route de l'Amiral Bayle, and Zhang Jiancheng, residing at No. 27, Gaofuli, Route Sainte-Marie. The detectives subsequently apprehended the two Zhangs, seizing a handgun from Zhang Afu's residence. They were taken back to the police station for interrogation and recording of their statements, and will be handed over to the court for trial. It is reported that Zheng's gang has committed numerous kidnapping cases in the British, French, and Chinese-controlled areas, and only now has he been arrested. Truly, his sins are countless and his crimes unforgivable.</p>

<h3>Korean Inventor Sun Changzhi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Welcomed and Introduced by Mu Ouchu and Others</p>
<p>▲ Various Circles in Shanghai Will Hold a Welcome Reception</p>
<p>Sun Changzhi, a young inventor from the industrial arts field, a native of Hampyeong County, Korea, is 27 years old. He possesses extraordinary inventive talent. At the age of 13, he was able to manufacture engines and handguns based on his research. He was arrested for privately manufacturing prohibited items but was released with the assistance of a Japanese lawyer, greatly enhancing his reputation. He then entered Osaka Aviation School, Hanseong Automotive School, Tokyo Commerce and other technical schools to pursue further studies. Last spring, upon graduation, he was hired as a member of the Tokyo Imperial Invention Association, having invented a total of 72 types of industrial products. The Japanese誉 refer to him as the "Edison of the East." He was invited by prominent Shanghai figures such as Mu Ouchu, Sun Hongyi, Wen Zongyao, Yan Zhifang, Li Cishan, and Yin Zhiling, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday (16th) by ship. He plans to test various industrial art products in Shanghai, which will undoubtedly benefit our country's art and education circles. It is reported that the Shanghai Federation of Associations will hold a welcome reception in due course, and it is hoped that all sectors will provide substantial support.</p>
<h3>Plague Rampant in Various Places</h3>
<p>Due to the prolonged drought, the epidemic is spreading without end. A younger brother named Xu Xiaodi, from the Xu Jiabang village, about two li from Yuepu Township, Baoshan, suddenly contracted the plague the day before yesterday. Xiaodi, being deeply attached to his brother, and his wife nursed him back to health. However, Xiaodi and his wife were infected. Xiaodi's wife died on the same day, and Xiaodi is currently still in critical condition. Since the death of Xiaodi's wife, those infected in the house have emerged one after another, and the situation is quite rampant. Within three days, a total of six or seven people have died, and more than twenty people have been infected. As a result, the villagers in the house are extremely frightened and feel as if they may die at any moment. Even close neighbors dare not inquire about them. Currently, the villagers in the house all close their doors to sleep before sunset and the sun declines. They still dare not get up and open the door until the next day dawns (according to the villagers, they get up quite early). They have to wait until the sun rises before daring to open their doors. The terrifying phenomenon of the plague can be seen here. It is said that when this epidemic is contracted, there is no vomiting or diarrhea, only abdominal pain like twisting, unable to lie down, hoarse voice, sunken fingers, and an extremely strange stench. No matter how strong the body is, upon smelling it, one immediately faints and falls, losing consciousness. In addition, Chen Heshang, a former patrolman of the 17th squad of the 4th district of the Songhu Water Police (because of his short stature, everyone calls him "Short Monk"), a native of Chongming, over 30 years old, has now been discharged from duty. Yesterday, he arrived in Song from Liuhe to look for friends. He suddenly contracted the plague and was in critical condition. He was immediately carried by someone to the Red Cross Third Plague Hospital attached to the Central Medical College on Taixing Road. Unexpectedly, upon arriving at the hospital's entrance, he was already dead. Because he had no relatives or friends in Songzhen, Zhou Lansheng, the local guarantor, reported it to the authorities and collected the coffin for burial. Since the outbreak of the plague in Songzhen, it has been a month, and more than a hundred people have died one after another. The situation is rampant and has not diminished.</p>

<h3>Hearing of Mother's Lawsuit Against Pimp</h3>
<p>▲ Accuses Him of Premeditated Murder</p>
<p>▲ Requests Compensation of 6,000 Yuan for Losses</p>
<p>The murderer Fan Hongsheng, who killed the female fortune teller Wen Ying, has been arrested by the police. Her mother, Ms. Shi, believes that her daughter's tragic death was orchestrated by the pimp Cheng Meixian. She has hired lawyer Dong Qin to file a private criminal lawsuit against Cheng and Fan. Her statement roughly states that her daughter, Wen Ying, was studying in Hangzhou at the age of 13 when Cheng lured her in every possible way to become his apprentice, teaching her fortune-telling. They lived as one of the five relationships. When she reached 14, Cheng, seeing her beauty, became lustful and, disregarding the dignity of a teacher, committed animalistic acts, engaging in various acts of rape that cannot be described in words. At that time, Cheng, fearing that his actions would be discovered by Ms. Shi, had a wild idea, falsely claiming that his concubine Lingqing had a photography studio next to the Grand Theater on Sanma Road in Shanghai, and asked Wen Ying to come to Shanghai with him to learn,</p>

<h3>Sun Qiying Detained for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Lawyer Sun Qiying, who has an office in the mainland commercial area, also serves as the principal of Zhongshan Elementary School near Gordon Road and Wuding Road. Guo Shiliang, a litigant, has filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Procuratorate, accusing Sun Qiying of embezzling over 200 silver dollars in legal representation and requesting legal action. The Procuratorate appointed Prosecutor Yang to investigate. However, due to repeated failures to summon Sun Qiying, he has been ordered detained twice without success. Consequently, a letter was sent to the First Special District Court of the concession, requesting assistance in the arrest. Yesterday morning, Zhou Qiwu, a bailiff from the District Procuratorate, along with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Gordon Road police station, arrested Sun Qiying inside Zhongshan Elementary School.</p>

<h3>Publications of the World and China Society Contain No Reactionary Content</h3>
<p>The "World and China," published by the World and China Society in this city, is a publication dedicated to academic research. Since its publication, it has been well-received by readers overseas.

<h3>Restoration of Xiaguang Bookstore</h3>
<p>Since its establishment last autumn, the Shanghai Xiaguang Bookstore has successively published various school textbooks, which have been well received by the educational community. Unfortunately, the bookstore was destroyed by fire during the Shanghai Incident, which was regrettable. It has been learned that the bookstore has decided to regroup and has relocated its premises to Yuzhenli on Lafayette Road. Recently, recognizing the widespread use of abacus calculations in society, it has specially compiled a book titled "Practical Abacus Calculation," which is rich in content and practical, making it most suitable as an abacus textbook for primary and secondary schools, people's schools, and vocational schools. The retail price is only fifteen cents per copy. In addition, the "Music Theory Textbook," compiled by Mr. Chen Jun et al. of the National Conservatory of Music, will also be published soon at a retail price of thirty cents per copy. The bookstore offers wholesale discounts, and those interested in ordering can contact the bookstore directly.

Remarkable effects have been seen immediately after acupuncture. Dr. Xu is now over sixty years old, and each acupuncture session requires in-depth study of tonification and drainage, which takes a long time. If there are too many patients seeking treatment, he is concerned that his energy will not be sufficient. Therefore, he limits treatment to ten patients per day.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>According to the manager of the Anle Palace Hotel, upon reading your newspaper on the 11th of this month, which stated that our establishment employs more than 50 Japanese dancers, we were extremely surprised. Since its opening, our establishment has been in operation for more than ten years and caters specifically to Westerners for drinking and dancing. We employ more than 40 Russian dancers, as well as a number of Chinese dancers and Portuguese women, but no Japanese dancers are among them. Fearing that this may cause confusion, we have entrusted our lawyer to write to your newspaper to request a correction in order to clarify the facts. We hope that you will investigate and comply with our request.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Dong Yu</p>
<p>August 16th</p>

<p>Two or One Branch Talk</p>
<h3>Zhang Sheng Cries</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Let me introduce a line from the play "The West Chamber," from the chapter "Borrowing the Chamber":</p>
<p>— Zhang Sheng cries, saying: Alas, my parents, you endured hardship to raise me; I wish to repay your profound kindness, but my gratitude is as boundless as the heavens — Miss is a woman, yet she thinks of honoring her roots; I hope the monk will be compassionate, and I will also prepare 5,000 coins to hire a monk to recite scriptures for my parents.</p>
<p>"The West Chamber" has passed, and the modern stage presents "The East Chamber," specifically portraying events in the northeastern region. The protagonist of "The West Chamber" is Zhang Sheng; the protagonist of "The East Chamber" is also Zhang Sheng. Zhang Sheng in "The West Chamber" cries, and Zhang Sheng in "The East Chamber" also cries. Zhang Sheng in "The West Chamber" cries before borrowing the chamber; Zhang Sheng in "The East Chamber" cries after losing the chamber. What is meant by "losing the chamber"? It means that the East Chamber was lost on September 18th. How does Zhang Sheng cry? Zhang Sheng weeps bitterly at a press conference:</p>
<p>— Zhang Sheng cries, saying: I have always acted according to my conscience and have already resigned from the Central Government; this is truly due to compelling circumstances, and I have historical family ties to the Northeast.</p>
<p>Zhang Sheng in "The West Chamber" cries insincerely; Zhang Sheng in "The East Chamber" cries sincerely. The insincere Zhang Sheng opens a new chapter in "The West Chamber" with his crying; the sincere Zhang Sheng ends the old history of "The East Chamber" with his crying.</p>
<p>I wonder which of the two Zhangs is more capable?</p>
<p>I wonder which of the two Zhangs has more initiative?</p>
<p>I won't offer a quick judgment to the questions above; I'll just offer them a couplet:</p>
<p>Peerless romantics as double protagonists,</p>
<p>On the spot, tears shed by two Zhangs.</p>
<h3>A Martyr of Jinzhou</h3>
<p>— Tian Yu Old Farmer</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from my friend Hu Yuwen from Yuguan, describing the martyr Chen Kaifang of Lianshan. He was arrested in Jinzhou City on the 26th of last month and died unyielding. After his death, the area lost a protector, causing the situation to worsen daily and on the verge of collapse. People inside the pass cried out in grief upon hearing of Chen's death.</p>
<p>Martyr Chen Kaifang was from Lianshan in Liaoning Province. In 1924, he went to Japan at government expense to attend military academy. After graduating, he went to Germany and the United States at his own expense to study industrial management. In the summer of last year, he returned to China after completing his studies. He initially planned to raise funds to develop the rich resources of northern Manchuria. However, before he could unpack, the September 18th Incident occurred, and the public was enraged by Zhang Xueliang's non-resistance and the loss of the three northeastern provinces. He took out his family wealth, recruited soldiers willing to die for the cause, and secretly drilled them in military tactics. Chen was knowledgeable in military affairs and knew that his strength was weak. He often used deception to attack the areas along the false Fengshan Railway. The Japanese army was exhausted from rushing to and fro and suffered significant losses. Therefore, after the Shenyang Incident, the Japanese army did not dare to drive straight into Shanhaiguan, solely because of Chen's disruptive activities in Lianshan. Consequently, the heroes of the green forests in western Liaoning deeply admired Chen's patriotic enthusiasm and were willing to offer their swords to help. Although Chen had only a few hundred soldiers, he could easily call on a hundred in response to an enemy attack. Yuguan relied on this for its safety. The Japanese army, repeatedly defeated in battle, feared him like a tiger. They instructed the puppet state to send envoys to persuade him, offering him 500,000 yen and a large number of weapons and ammunition, and appointing him as the Commander of Western Liaoning. Chen sternly refused, laughing and saying to the envoys, "I am an upright Chinese man and cannot sit idly by as my country falls. However, I am fortunate to be an honest hero. Otherwise, I might as well pretend to accept your offer and, after receiving the military supplies, deal with you later. It would not be too late. You can quickly return and report back to your master and see which country will eventually control these three provinces of Liaoning and Jilin."</p>
<h3>The Short History of the Feiying Battleship</h3>
<p>— Juemin</p>
<p>The Feiying battleship is sunk. The Feiying battleship was bombed and sunk by the civil war. By chance, I discussed with a friend and got the brief history of it. I will record it in Freedom Talk for those who want to commemorate it.</p>
<p>The Feiying battleship is one of the oldest in the Chinese fleet. It happened to be built at the time of the Wuxu coup. Kang Youwei drove the battleship out to escape. The battleship is the Feiying. Therefore, Kang later wrote a poem about it, with the line "Feiying pursued the waves like mountains." During the Battle of Dharma Protection, Cheng Biguang led the battleship to the south, beginning its belonging to the Guangdong fleet. Afterwards, the boiler was damaged beyond repair, and it was regarded as an abandoned ship for a long time. Bao Luoting came to Guangdong and funded the Kuomintang by using more than 200,000 yuan to buy a new boiler in Germany and give it to the Guangdong government. The Guangdong government also changed the captain of the battleship to a Russian. Bao often held secret party meetings in the battleship. It was once a major base for the communist party's activities. When Li Jishen took over Guangdong, he took this battleship from Hong Kong to the province. He received a warm welcome. The grand occasion was unprecedented. Even today, the people of Guangdong still mention it. Now, unfortunately, due to the conflict between the sea and the land, it was destroyed by a shot from the civil war.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows you knows that your heart is made of iron and it is difficult to change your mind. We left in depression. Later, Chen repeatedly risked his life to infiltrate the Japanese army in disguise to scout out military intelligence. He launched surprise attacks and gained many victories. In the middle of last month, the rebel army besieged Jinzhou. Chen also participated in the siege. However, due to the superior weapons of the Japanese army, they were unable to conquer it after a long siege. Many people were willing to retreat. Chen said angrily: "I am a good Chinese man. If things don't work out, it's God's will. How can I surrender to the Japanese invaders? Kill me quickly." He cursed loudly. He was eventually killed, along with four of his followers. This happened on the 26th of last month. From then on, the Northeast lost a person to rely on, and the situation in Yuguan became increasingly urgent.</p>
<h3>As Though on the Water Bank</h3>
<p>— Ms. Fujiyoshi</p>
<p>The heat persists. The building residents especially feel sad. It is slightly cooler in the mornings and evenings. My husband often takes a walk. He is accustomed to country living and does not like the hustle and bustle of the city. One day, Ms. Liang Saizhen, introduced me to a swimming pool. I thought that city women only care about dressing up. They sleep late into the morning, enjoying their dreams. Moreover, the harsh sun shines so that the fair skin turns the color of soy sauce. Saizhen argued: "You are talking about rich ladies and flirtatious women. New young people value sports above all else. Swimming is even a specialty in schools. Natural beauty lies in healthy muscles. What's wrong with black and white? Without saying more, watch me try." So, we visited this morning.</p>
<p>Mingyuan was once a place for dog racing. The road is very far. The car travels for about an hour. The morning light is faint. The cool breeze blows. It makes me feel very happy. After buying tickets and entering, we walked to the pool. There is still about a mile away. My weak body is wet from sweating. The pool is two acres in size. The spring water is rippling. From shallow to deep, the water is clear and you can see the bottom. There are only three or five Westerners bathing. Saizhen changed clothes and jumped in, splashing water everywhere. I couldn't see her. In a moment, her beautiful body gradually rose, her pretty face showing shyness, as if she was given a bath in Huaqing. I am afraid that the Taizhen of that year was not as beautiful. I sat under an umbrella, watching her sometimes fast, sometimes slow, going up and down as she wished. Sometimes she used her hands, sometimes her feet, and sometimes she used all four limbs. It was flexible and charming. The Western angel could not hope to catch up with her. I suddenly remembered the women in the villages, who also bathed in the clear streams after working in the fields. When I saw Saizhen's skills, they were extraordinary. I realized that yesterday's speech was not a lie. She also said to me: "My sister, Saizhu, has better skills than me. She can lie on the bottom of the pool and rise after five minutes. If there is a chance in the future, you will witness this." As noon approached, the swimmers gradually gathered. Saizhen enjoyed herself and forgot to go back. My husband couldn't wait any longer and urged her to get up. I heard that many movie stars at sea are good at swimming. Why don't we make an appointment to get together and show our strengths? I know the results will be impressive. Don't say I'm a busybody.</p>
<h3>Promoting Domestic Films and Resisting Foreign Films</h3>
<p>— By Yi Zhou —</p>
<p>Shouting slogans, posting banners. Once the slogans are shouted and the banners are posted, the matter is considered finished. The biggest problem with modern Chinese people is that they only put effort into their mouths and pens, but are unwilling to use their hands to do things practically.</p>
<p>"Promote domestic films, resist imported films." These two sentences have become the only central slogan in the film industry and the only banner. But unfortunately, this slogan and banner, like ordinary slogans and banners, are just a facade on the lips and in writing, and there is no real action behind them.</p>
<p>Promoting domestic films and resisting imported films are truly causally related. To promote domestic films, we must resist imported films. To resist imported films, we must promote domestic films. But if we were to first ban the import of foreign films and then promote domestic films, that is absolutely impossible. Only by first improving the "quality" of domestic films, so that the minds and eyes of the people gradually turn to domestic films, will we naturally achieve the effect of resisting imported films.</p>
<p>The current film industry, on the one hand, shouts slogans about promoting domestic films, and on the other hand, produces crude and inferior films to deceive the audience and disappoint them. At that time, even if the audience has enthusiasm for supporting domestic films, it will drop below zero. The result is driving fish into the deep and scaring birds into the thickets, driving the audience to foreign film cinemas. Therefore, to promote domestic films, the film industry must do things practically, producing some valuable films. Otherwise, simply following the old path of shouting slogans and posting banners is truly a disgrace to the film industry.</p>
<p>Due to the surging power of foreign sound films in recent years, the Tianyi Film Company has decided to specialize in shooting sound films to resist this trend, as domestic silent films are almost being eliminated. Recently, they have also spent a lot of effort and money to produce a war romance film, "Two Orphans on the Battlefield." It is said that the theme, plot, acting, sets, lighting, sound, etc. of this film are no less than those of foreign films. This may have some effect in resisting foreign films.</p>
<p>I believe that to promote domestic films, on the one hand, we should pay attention to improving "quality," and on the other hand, we must also pay attention to increasing "quantity." Otherwise, supply will not meet demand, and the effect of resistance will be very weak. Therefore, a comprehensive plan to promote domestic films and resist foreign films truly depends on the efforts of the entire Chinese film industry.</p>

<h3>Idle Chat at the Viewing Studio</h3>
<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>▲ Wu Tingfang</p>
<p>Wu Tingfang was the earliest to study in the United States and the earliest to earn a doctorate. After returning to China, he became a lawyer in Hong Kong. Hong Kong was originally Chinese territory but leased to the United Kingdom, so the registration of lawyers required the permission of British officials. Tingfang knew many foreigners, so he obtained it without much effort. At that time, the Qing court was vigorously discussing diplomacy, which they called foreign affairs. Governor-General Li Hongzhang especially advocated it. He heard of Tingfang's name and recruited him to his office, entrusting him with important responsibilities in foreign affairs. He was repeatedly recommended to the rank of Daotai. Later, he was sent as an envoy to European and American countries. After returning to the court, he was appointed as Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He did not attach himself to powerful figures and was not promoted for several years. He requested to retire and lived at sea, building a residence called Guandu (Viewing the Ferry), intending to spend his remaining years there. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the northern and southern sides resolved the situation through peace talks. Tingfang was elected as the chief representative of the South, firmly advocating democratic republicanism. Tang Shaoyi, the northern representative, was moved by him and sent a telegram to Yuan Shikai, saying that the peace talks would not succeed without it. Finally, Yuan Shikai agreed to his proposal. Sun Yat-sen assumed the provisional presidency in Nanjing, appointing Tingfang as the Minister of Justice. After the unified government was established, a Merit Bureau was established, and Tingfang was awarded the first-class order of merit to commend his achievements. For the next five years, he did not participate in politics but occasionally appeared in telegrams regarding political upheavals. After Yuan Shikai's death, Li Yuanhong succeeded to the presidency and changed the cabinet, appointing Shaoyi as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Zhang Xun and Ni Sichong, local officials, jointly attacked Shaoyi. Shaoyi resigned in anger. Yuanhong remembered Tingfang's support for the republic and his contributions to the country, so he appointed him to succeed Shaoyi. His son, Zhao Shu, was then serving as a counselor in the ministry. Knowing that his father was about to arrive, he requested to be excused. After Tingfang took office, he said that he had not heard of politics for a long time and was too old to be impatient. He suggested that Zhao Shu be appointed as the deputy minister. The president agreed. Father and son served in the same ministry, which was praised as a beautiful story. Tingfang's actions in not avoiding his relatives were no less than those of the ancients. At that time, Duan Qirui was the Premier. His political views differed from those of Huang Xing. The conflict between the president and the premier intensified. Huang Xing dismissed Qirui, appointing Tingfang as acting prime minister. He soon resigned and went to Guangdong to serve as the president of the military government. He ate vegetarian food for many years, claiming that he would live to be over two hundred years old. However, he died of illness due to shock during the Guangzhou incident. He was unable to enjoy his long life. Was it the will of heaven?</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>(Report from American Eastern Banking Corporation)</p>
<p>After a sharp drop last Friday, the New York stock market experienced a chaotic Saturday. However, this Monday, the market rebounded, with prices rising across the board, some by as much as five points. Trading volume, however, was not robust, with only 1.7 million shares traded throughout the day, which was less than the volume traded in half a day on Saturday. The rapid rebound on Monday was mainly due to continued price increases, which stabilized investor sentiment. However, President Hoover's speech remained deeply imprinted in people's minds, so investors were not overly enthusiastic. Based on the current situation, the stock market seems likely to trend upward. The Dow Jones Index is attached for reference:</p>
<p>August 13 August 15 30 Industrials 63.19 66.51 Up 3.32 20 Railroads 25.54 28.30 Up 2.76 20 Utilities 27.05 28.74 Up 1.69 Also attached: Shanghai Commercial Securities Index from American Eastern Banking Corporation.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn and Cotton Flower Markets Quiet</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is quiet and the situation is hesitant. Due to the lack of substantial economic relief domestically, buyers lack the capacity for active procurement. Current yarn transactions are weak. Although American cotton prices are rising sharply, gold prices are falling, making the yarn market weaker than the cotton flower market. Major buyers are also taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>▲ Fluctuations in Renbiao Cotton Futures</p>
<p>At the opening of the Renbiao cotton futures market, American cotton prices rose again, causing tension in the market. Prices for all months rose by 3.5 copper coins. Actual sales of the near months were sluggish. The gold market declined sharply, and market sentiment suddenly loosened, with all months falling by 6.7 copper coins. As a result, all months closed down by 4, 5, 9, and 8 copper coins respectively. In the afternoon, the cotton flower market trended higher, pulling up the cotton futures market, with all months rising by 2, 3, 5, and 6 copper coins respectively. Total transaction volume for the day was 25,850 bales. Sales included 1,150 bales of Dafeng, 1,800 bales of Yiyu, 1,000 bales of Changfeng, 750 bales of Ruid, and 550 bales of Dachangcheng. Purchases included 1,850 bales of Yichang, 700 bales of Xincheng, 650 bales of Tongxing, 750 bales of Tianlong, 850 bales of Zhenda, and 650 bales of Tongyu. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>▲ Sluggish Sales of Spot Yarn</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn are relatively sluggish. Total purchases by all groups for the day were estimated at 800 bales, of which futures contracts for September and October accounted for more than 500 bales. The market is stagnant. The purchase amounts by various parties are listed below:</p>
<p>Shantou 30 Changsha 505 Fellow Traders 55 Guangdong 172 Inland 40 Total 800 bales</p>
<p>Active Buying in Cotton Futures Market</p>
<p>The cotton market was flat and weak in the morning. Although American cotton prices were high, silver prices lengthened and gold buying trended downward, leading to weak market sentiment. In the afternoon, the gold market rebounded slightly, and buyers in the market increased their purchases, leading to a tense market. They felt that American cotton prices were unlikely to fall. With Mitter cotton landed in Shanghai (including water tax) priced between 35.6 taels, domestic cotton was relatively cheaper, thus fueling strong speculative interest. The current situation is firm. Future developments depend on the American and Indian cotton markets.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Biao Cotton Futures Turn Tight After Falling</p>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng Biao cotton futures market, buying was strong due to high American cotton prices, but later, as gold prices fell, long positions were liquidated, causing prices to fall. As a result, all months fell by up to 3.5 copper coins. The market opened flat in the afternoon, and the near month situation became very tight, with all months rising by 3 and 4 copper coins. Total transaction volume for the day was 99,300 dan. Sales included 5,400 dan of Yuanda, 2,900 dan of Mingxing, 2,000 dan of Tongxing, and 4,400 dan of Yichang. Purchases included 12,700 dan of Changhe, 3,400 dan of Changfeng, and 4,000 dan of Tianlong. The closing prices of Zheng Biao are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Closing Price Change from Previous Close Inventory Volume December 3365 Up 2 287,400 August 3390 Up 10 57,100 January 3375 Up 15 191,100 October 3360 Up 15 215,900 Total 1,024,700 November 3370 Up 25 273,200</p>
<p>▲ Spot Cotton Transactions Quiet</p>
<p>Demand from spot cotton mills is stagnant. No activity was reported for the day.</p>
<h3>American and British Cotton Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices remained steady due to a lack of sellers. Wall Street firms and industry players actively bought, creating a quiet but firm market. Futures prices rose by 16 to 18 points, while spot prices rose by 15 points. British cotton futures rose by 10 to 12 points, while spot prices rose by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 15th):</p>

<h3>Recent News on New Cotton Crops in Tianjin</h3>
<p>According to news from Tianjin, cotton crop conditions are very good in the Xiyu River area. American seeds and Hebei cotton stalks are already 2.5 to 2.6 feet tall, with each stalk bearing 6 to 7 cotton bolls, more than in the past. Although there has been heavy rain recently, the weather has cleared up immediately, which is very helpful for the growth of cotton seedlings. If the weather remains clear and dry in the coming days, there is good reason to expect a bountiful harvest. The biggest threat to cotton seedlings is damp and moldy weather. The new cotton picking season is expected to begin in the late lunar month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Cotton Inventory Statistics at the End of July</h3>

<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Thin Rice Up 20 Cents</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday in Shanghai South, supply from various sources was limited, and outlets on this street were also limited. Changxi Beigeng and Sutong rice prices remained unchanged. Thin rice was scarce, and Ningbo rice prices moved slightly, opening 20 cents higher. There was no activity in new japonica rice or foreign Du Jian rice. Bianyuan and Yinyuan rice were scarce and there was no market.</p>
<p>▲ Around ten boats arrived at the Suzhou River bank in Zhabei. Transactions between urban and rural areas were quieter than the previous market. Demand for Kunshan and Yixing rice was low, with prices down 20 cents. Changxi Beigeng rice was sold as soon as it arrived. Although early and late rice were available on the wharves, the quantities were small and the situation was stable. The situation for new japonica rice was similar to that in the South Market. Total daily transactions were around 1,500 piculs.</p>
<h3>Hunan Jing Rice Arriving in Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>▲ First Batch of Over 1,000 Bags En Route</p>
<p>▲ Yantai Merchants Purchasing Saigon Rice</p>
<p>The foreign rice market yesterday continued the weakness of the past few days, with the market becoming even softer. Xiaojiao rice continued to fall by 3 to 5 cents, and Saigon rice fell by 10 cents. Central West Saigon rice fell more than 20 cents compared to last week. Sales only began after the market price was reduced. The total sales for the day were 2,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice and 1,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice. Yantai merchants purchased 1,500 bags of Saigon rice, and the rest were purchased by merchants on this street. No. 1 Saigon rice was priced at 10 yuan, 9 yuan and 97 cents, down to 9 yuan and 80 cents. Xiaojiao rice was priced at 9 yuan and 40 cents to 32 cents.</p>
<p>The lifting of the ban on Chaonan rice was reported in the newspapers. Shipments had already been loaded from Hankou and the upper reaches. Shanghai's foreign rice inventory is sufficient, and market prices are falling, so it was deemed uneconomical to ship the rice. According to sources in Hunan, the first batch of over 1,000 bags of Jingjiang rice from that area is en route, packed by civilians. The cost is 9 yuan and 23 cents, and it will be test-marketed. If it is profitable, more shipments will be loaded.</p>
<h3>Marked Flour Market Starts Firm, Then Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed an initial firming trend followed by a decline after opening in the morning. Foreign wheat prices rebounded by around 20 to 30 cents, and off-market buying interest was quite strong. However, major manufacturers continued to sell off batches of flour due to large inventories, especially forward contracts. As a result, market sentiment became shaky and the market gradually weakened, falling by about 2 cents from the highest point. In terms of actual sales, demand has been quite strong recently, with various northern ports continuing to add to their orders, making for a lively market. Therefore, if factory output were to stop, the market would likely stabilize. As a result, prices for August and September fell by 7.5 li compared to the previous day, prices for October and November fell by 1.5 fen, prices for December fell by 1.75 fen, and prices for January fell by 2.25 fen.</p>
<h3>Decline in Wheat Futures Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market was stable in the morning, with foreign wheat prices up 20 to 30 cents. Both buyers and sellers were taking a wait-and-see approach, and market prices fluctuated little. However, the market opened lower in the afternoon because of the weak flour market. Recent long positions from Wuxi merchants were being liquidated, and there were rumors that factories would continue to order two shipments of foreign wheat. In addition, domestic wheat prices have recently softened, with Gaoyou wheat priced at 45 cents per picul, and spot wheat in Wuxi also falling in price. As a result, traders were hedging, breaking the firm market. The equivalent price of foreign wheat is between two months, and the market is quite volatile. As a result, the price for this month fell by 4 cents compared to the previous day, the price for September and October fell by 5 cents, and the price for November and December fell by 4 cents. Spot wheat saw no activity due to sluggish sales.</p>
<p>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms: Silk Market Turns Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk market in Shanghai turned quiet. After news of a sharp drop in raw silk prices overseas was confirmed, European firms reduced their buying interest. Chinese silk merchants were also firm in their attitude due to the scarcity of raw materials, leading to a quiet market. Only Lianna purchased ten bales of Jing Shuang brand Shanghai white factory silk, grade 13 to 15, for 580 taels. Gaobei purchased twenty bales of ST brand first, second, third, and fourth grade Mianyang yellow silk for 400 taels.</p>
<h3>Improved Sales of Drawn Heart Zhenmei European Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, major tea merchants, including Jardine Matheson, Duddel, and Tongfu, began purchasing drawn heart Zhenmei tea, leading to active trading. Sales of needle eyebrow tea were particularly active, and the market was firm and rising. Although Gongxi's inventory was slightly larger, the Russian Assistance Society also started discussing prices after seeing tea factories being searched, and is expected to formally begin purchasing within a few days. However, the black tea market remained quiet.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Cantonese Dried Fruits Show Mixed Price Movements</p>
<p>▲ New Honey Dates Fall Again</p>
<p>Over 3,000 boxes of Haikou and Shuidong dried fruits have arrived recently. It is reported that various shops in the North and South Markets have opened, and prices have fallen by 70 to 80 cents to several cents compared to the initial market price, with the lower grades down 50 cents. The market is still active and the trend is stabilizing.</p>
<p>▲ Over 20,000 pieces of Jinshan dried fruits have arrived, so the market has gradually loosened. Both buyers and sellers have suffered losses. In the past two days, the opening prices have improved slightly, with the upper grades increasing by about two liang and the middle and lower grades increasing by several cents. High-quality goods are even being sold at original water prices, which is a large drop followed by a small rebound.</p>
<p>▲ After the new Jiashan honey dates were released, prices have fallen. Yesterday, the Lanxi goods also arrived. Because they were new, the quality was relatively soft, so the selling price was similar. The market price yesterday was 24 taels, which was another drop compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>New Golden Needle Vegetables Oversupply</p>
<p>▲ Prices Are Affordable</p>
<p>This year's golden needle vegetables have been harvested abundantly and are of good quality. Vegetables from Daxing, Yanghua, Xiangzhuang, Zhongxing, Xuzhou and other places are mostly yellow, bright in color, and dry. Therefore, the market price has not fluctuated much. However, Sichuan vegetables are of lower quality. Recently, the supply of vegetables has exceeded demand, and the market prices are very affordable. The market price is 11.5 to 12 taels. Due to the poor quality of the goods, the market price is 11.8 to 11.5 taels, with lower grades discounted. Old vegetables are priced at 5 or 6 taels, and are sold for around 5 to 6.2 taels. The market is flat.</p>
<h3>Dried Seafood: Arrival of Shrimp Tails Is Limited, Market Prices Rise</h3>
<p>▲ The goods were all absorbed by firms such as Xieji, Dinyu, and Xinmaohe, and stored in refrigerated warehouses. As a result, there is a shortage of goods on the street, and the market has increased. In less than ten days, the price has skyrocketed by more than ten taels. It is rumored that the foreign production market has also reported an increase. Although number goods have been obtained, the number is small, and demand exceeds supply, so they are sold as soon as they arrive, with little storage. Yesterday, ten barrels arrived, and the asking price was 85 taels. The firms were very quick to purchase, and they were immediately sold out. Given the tightness of the market, there may be a further increase in prices later on.</p>
<p>▲ Jin Gou shrimp tails from Hong Kong are priced at 95 yuan, equivalent to about 90 taels in Shanghai. Yesterday, six boxes were sold, and the asking price was 93.5 to 91 taels. Customers were in urgent need, and the goods were purchased by Hankou merchants. It is rumored that another 19 boxes are en route, and it depends on the market's appetite when they arrive before determining the prosperity of the market.</p>
<h3>Hardware Stores Selling Off Existing Stocks</h3>
<p>The hardware market was very quiet yesterday. With the exception of necessary goods, customers were not willing to purchase general goods. However, foreign firms sold off their existing stocks yesterday. As a result, large amounts of Red Bird, Plain White Iron, Makkou Iron, New Lead Wire, and French Nails were put on sale. The asking price for Red Bird White Iron was 90 cents. 180-pound Makkou Iron was priced at 18 taels and 50 cents, and 90-pound Makkou Iron was priced at 9 taels and 50 cents. New Lead Wire was priced at 12 taels, and French Nails were priced at 6 taels and 65 cents. The market price for existing stocks was 50 cents to 1 tael cheaper, and Red Bird White Iron was as much as 100 cents cheaper per sheet. However, the market was very anxious due to the recent heightened market prices.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar are Released</h3>
<p>▲ Taikoo Sugar Also Releases 3,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw few transactions, and the market was flat. Dutch sugar No. 24 Xiang Sand White was traded at 14 taels and 55 cents. Hong Kong goods were priced at 14 taels and 30 cents. No. 16 Medium Sand White was priced at 13 taels and 75 cents. Raw red sugar was priced at 12 taels and 65 cents. Transactions were sluggish, and the trend was weakening. Taikoo Sugar B mark was priced at 16 taels and 25 cents. CW mark was priced at 15 taels and 70 cents. HX mark was priced at 15 taels and 15 cents. Trading was quiet and the market was stable. 2,000 bags of B mark ready for shipment were priced at 7 taels and 25 cents, standard new tax. Prices for the remaining marks were also pushed lower. There was still active demand. Because the price was right, the market for Dutch sugar was more active. Jebsen &amp; Jessen sold 300 tons of No. 24 Raw Sand White at a price of Dutch currency 4 yuan and 62.5 cents. Changxing Firm also sold 400 tons at a price of 4 yuan and 60 cents, all standard new tax. The firms were very interested and had already sold the goods.</p>

<p>Opinion</p>
<h3>A Few Words in Response to Three Gentlemen (Continued)</h3>
<p>Mr. Rose said, "If you think you have been bullied, it is fundamentally wrong not to study them again." I think that if one is bullied, it is indeed wrong to never study their knowledge again. However, it is also wrong to study their knowledge while being insulted and oppressed by them. As for me saying that anyone with a little heart would not want to go to Zhabei and Hongkou because the traces of Japanese cruelty left behind are unpleasant to see, Mr. Rose said, "We should (perhaps not this 'should') go every day, every hour, to make people see these cruel traces more and get a deep impression." These are different personal feelings and different viewpoints. In fact, my saying that I don't want to go is indeed useless, and Mr. Rose saying to go every hour, every day, or even to live and sleep there, I am afraid it is also in vain.</p>
<p>Person</p>
<p>Mr. Rose also said, "Studying in Japan and other countries should change the previous plan." This issue is Mr. Rose's freedom to express his opinion, and there is no need to criticize it. However, I will take this opportunity to say a few words. I have been insulted and abused by foreigners, and this is not the first time. In particular, I have been bullied by the Japanese even more. Have you ever asked a few students who went abroad to study if they have changed their direction?</p>
<p>Mr. Xingnan said, "According to Mr. Fo, under the active aggression of Japanese imperialism, Chinese students should absolutely not go to Japan to study. However, were not the Opium War, the Anglo-French Allied Forces, the Sino-French War, and the Eight-Nation Alliance also active aggression of imperialism? If so, not only should we not go to Japan, but we should also not go to countries like England and France." That is not wrong, but during the Opium War and when the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing, did Mr. Xingnan ever hear or see any students going to countries like England and France? I am afraid that their studies were either before or after the wars. This point shows the weakness of national patriotism today, which is not as good as before. Even in intellectual circles, there is such a phenomenon, almost as if China's country, China's land, and China's compatriots have absolutely no relationship with me from which country, and it does not matter to me if the country is destroyed, I will go to study anyway.</p>
<p>Mr. Xingnan also said, "In my opinion, academics do not distinguish between territories," etc. In simple terms, it seems that academics have no borders. That does not seem wrong, but I would like to add a condition: If you set aside the concept of the country and personal integrity, but only know that academics have no borders, it is a very dangerous thing. In this era of seeking knowledge, we only know that academics have no borders. In the future, in the era of working, we only know that occupations have no borders and that money has no borders. Therefore, one can be a traitor or a treacherous merchant. If I go further, I am afraid that Mr. Xingnan will have nowhere to stand. I will leave some room and not say everything.</p>
<p>The first mistake in this kind of talk is to only know academics and forget everything else. It is truly worthy of being the tone of a good student. Rare, rare. I will now take a famous traitor as an example. Hu Lifu, the traitor from Zhabei, was recently arrested by the Public Security Bureau. Please Mr. Xingnan take a look at Hu Lifu's confession. The reason he gave is more beautiful than your statement that academics have no borders. He said, "If the local area is not maintained, the people will not be able to sleep peacefully because of the influx of people from Jiangbei." Therefore, the local maintenance association they organized was entirely for the benefit of the local people. Please Mr. Xingnan think about it, for the sake of academics, they forgot the country and forgot integrity. Hu Lifu, for the sake of the local area, also forgot the country and forgot integrity. What Mr. Xingnan said was only for personal learning, but what Hu Lifu said was for local security. Is his topic not more practical and far-reaching than what Mr. Xingnan said? Why does everyone call him a traitor?</p>
<p>Hu Lifu maintained local security under the hostile behavior of the two countries. Several students (referring to several students who studied in Japan after the September 18th Incident, please do not misunderstand) went to give money to the enemy country under the hostile behavior of the two countries to learn their language and writing. Are the mentality of these students worse than Hu Lifu's?</p>
<p>This kind of letter is worthless to respond to, but if I do not make it clear, I am afraid that your confusion will never be solved, and it will cause misunderstandings among former and future students studying in Japan. Therefore, I do not hesitate to say everything to inform you. If you think you can definitely go now, it is your freedom, and I have no right to force you. However, I want to tell you again that not only do I oppose students studying in Japan now, but Japan also does not welcome Chinese people to study there. Please do not go astray.</p>
<p>Originally, I did not want to get into a war of words with others because everyone has their own opinions. I cannot force others to agree, and others cannot force me to agree. Because you want me to respond, I cannot but say a few words. In the future, whether you scold me or laugh at me, I will only laugh it off and not bother with this idle air. Respectfully replied,</p>

<h3>Farewell to My Wife Before Joining the Army</h3>
<p>— Ms. Amei</p>
<p>Changing love does not forget saving the country, saving the country is worthy of love. The Northeast has fallen, and the building is about to collapse. It is an opportunity for heroic sons and daughters to serve the country. Therefore, I write two poems of farewell to my wife and send them to patriotic heroic sons and daughters for their review.</p>
<p>The bright moon is still in the sky, the morning rooster has urged me to rise, a man promises his body to the country, generously bidding farewell to his wife and children. Zheren kisses my chest, Zheng Guan kisses my head, parting is imminent, tears fall silently. Wave goodbye from here, go to drink the dragon's blood. My body marches towards the outside of the pass, my soul resides in my chamber. Alas, my soul resides in my chamber, kill the enemy with the same heart.</p>
<h3>From the Army to My Wife</h3>
<p>The morning wind points to the military flag, the morning sun shines on the military cap, waking up in the morning to touch my head, unknowingly looking at each other and smiling. With the enemy, I have no home, with the enemy, I have no country. A man serves the country, who does not have a heavenly duty? I remember you kissing my heart, I remember you kissing my head, although my body is separated from you, my heart belongs to you. Live to be my hero, die to be a great ghost. Day and night I recite your words, raising and lowering my head I see your face. Alas, raising and lowering my head I see your face, my long whistle is like a rainbow.</p>

<h3>Rayon and its Manufacturing Method</h3>
<p>— Yao</p>
<p>Silk is originally a natural product, and China has a very large output. It occupies a very important position in exports. However, in recent years, after rayon was invented in Europe, the United States has tried its best to study and improve it. Today, rayon has become an imitation of natural silk, and is the only beautiful raw material in silk fabrics. Therefore, China's silk industry has declined invisibly. From a scientific point of view, the materials and luster of rayon in the future will definitely be better than natural silk. At that time, natural silk may even be eliminated. Therefore, if the Chinese want to maintain their previous authority in the silk industry, they must quickly study rayon and its manufacturing methods.</p>
<p>The raw material of rayon is a carbohydrate fiber. This raw material is an organic substance that grows in plants. For example, the fine filaments of cotton and hemp contain this carbohydrate fiber. The main component of small trees or vegetables is also carbohydrate fiber. It is just that trees are different from other plants in that when they grow up, the fiber and wood can gather together to create the hardness of the trees. Therefore, we can no longer extract them as raw materials for rayon.</p>
<p>There are four methods for manufacturing rayon. However, in industrial manufacturing, the equipment and devices are very complicated, so it is not convenient to describe them in detail in this short article. Now, I will only write down the general steps of these methods and the chemical changes contained therein so that everyone can get some concepts of rayon making methods.</p>
<p>(1) Put cotton in dilute sulfuric acid and dilute nitric acid to turn it into nitric acid fiber. Dissolve this nitric acid fiber in ether and alcohol. Then we get a kind of Colldlon (chemical name, this material can be used to make photos). Place Colldlon in an instrument with fine holes at the bottom, and use air pressure to press this substance out of the small holes like putting on water powder. Therefore, a silk-like thing has appeared. Then add sodium hydrosulfide to this silk-like thing to remove its original nitrate. Then you get rayon. Then pick up this fine silk, hold the two ends, and dry it in hot air, then pack it and send it to the market.</p>
<p>(2) Boil cotton in water. After the bleaching procedure, dissolve it in a solvent of cuprous oxide and hydrogen hydroxide to make a solution. This solution is rayon. As long as you put it in an instrument with small holes in the bottom and squeeze out the thin silk, then bleach, stretch, and dry it, it becomes rayon.</p>
<p>(3) Add sodium hydroxide to the fiber in wood to make soda fiber (Sodacellulose). Then add carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide to make a solution. Then press it into thin silk. To add sodium sulfide to completely remove the sulfur contained in the silk, and it becomes pure cellulose rayon.</p>
<p>(4) Put the fiber in hydrochloric acid and anhydrous acid to make cellulose acetate. Then add acetone (Acetone) to make a solution. Then apply appropriate pressure to make it into thin silk, and then it becomes rayon.</p>

<h3>Replying to Mr. Zhen's Question on Gender Equality</h3>
<p>— Zu'e</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Zhen's question on gender equality, just as he said, "It is still a pending case, not yet resolved." We cannot find the basis of his argument in his article. The few irrelevant "factual" examples are just biased opinions from the male perspective! According to Mr. Zhen, women who haven't read Western textbooks are men's slaves, and women who have read them are men's toys. Regardless of whether Mr. Zhen has other intentions, in terms of the essence of gender equality, he doesn't quite understand this issue!</p>
<p>In fact, the issue of gender equality is not about whether it can be resolved or not, nor can it be definitively said that it will only be resolved at a certain time. According to Mr. Zhen's view, old-fashioned women are slaves, and modern women are toys. Then, to be honest, gender equality will never be realized—if a woman who can write "Dear Brother" and say "Kiss me," "I love you" is a man's toy, then a man who can sing "Sister, I love you" or call out "My little lamb," wouldn't he</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>be a woman's toy? Originally, from a woman's perspective, men chasing after women, wearing upright clothes, combing their hair sleek, and devoutly worshipping at the foot of the qipao, isn't this willingly being women's toys!</p>
<p>In the past, society was indeed too unequal to women. "Men roam, women are hidden" is a clear example of gender inequality! Now, all rights and obligations in society are indistinguishable between men and women. In fact, it can be said that gender equality has already been achieved. As long as we sincerely treat this issue, we can resolve the issue of gender equality anytime, anywhere. Otherwise, under the general concept of still being male-centered and viewing women as "women are always women," even if there are opportunities for gender equality, realization will ultimately not be possible! Just like Mr. Zhen's criticism and observation of women, it will similarly hinder the issue of gender equality!</p>
<p>Gender equality should indeed come from women's self-awareness and self-respect, but men should abandon the concept of "male-centered thinking" and assist women's self-awareness and give women opportunities to resolve it. It is absolutely wrong to simply blame women under certain circumstances and certain abnormal situations!</p>

<h3>The Life of a Young Mistress</h3>
<p>— Shiben</p>
<p>"A Cui! Quickly light the lamp," Wang, the young mistress, lying on the dazzling copper bed, shouted sleepily, just waking up from a dream. While shouting, on her oily, smooth face, which hadn't been powdered yet, she still had a half-awake expression. At the same time, a pair of pretty eyes and a rosy mouth repeatedly yawned, with tears and mucus, showing the emergency and panic in Yanhua Cave (a euphemism for a brothel or a luxurious boudoir).</p>
<p>"Oh! Coming, madam. Why did you wake up so early today? It's only one o'clock," a fifteen or sixteen-year-old maid, hearing her mistress's call, knew that the young mistress wanted to have her "electric charge" (smoke opium). She immediately moved the opium tray, which she had just wiped clean on the beauty couch, to the young mistress's bedside, squatted down, and began to do her only job: packing the opium pipe. For a while, the clear smoke curled up. Squeak, squeak, A Cui packed a pipe, and the young mistress smoked a pipe. After an hour, A Cui's skill was truly great. She had transformed the young mistress, who was lying on the bed like a living dead person, into a vibrant "heroine" (someone high on opium).</p>
<p>After the young mistress's cylinder (body) was fully charged with electricity (opium), she got out of bed and did some seductive work for men: applying powder, rouge, and lipstick. After all the transformation procedures were completed, the old nanny brought a sumptuous feast. Although it was already three o'clock in the afternoon, almost dinner time for others, the young mistress still considered it her first breakfast.</p>
<p>After using this so-called early breakfast, she went back to bed and had dozens of sweet kisses with her closest bloodless killer (opium). She looked at her watch and thought that Mrs. Zhang had invited guests at eight o'clock, and there were still a few hours to wait. She felt extremely bored sitting at home. It would be better to play four rounds of mahjong before going. So, she immediately called A Cui to summon troops and recruit partners.</p>
<p>In less than a few minutes, Mrs. Li, Miss He, XXX, all came in response. The lonely air in the room was suddenly broken. For a while, there was the sound of swallows chattering and orioles singing, extremely lively. After chatting with the ladies for a while, the young mistress threw out the one hundred and thirty-six tiles to carry out hostile actions.</p>
<p>After four rounds of battle, it was getting late. The young mistress hurriedly ran to the room, did some more touch-ups, came out, jumped into a rickshaw, and told A Mao to pull quickly to Zhang's mansion. When she arrived, Mrs. Zhang had been waiting for a long time and said as soon as she saw her, "You're so busy! We've been waiting for you for a long time." She smiled and said, "Because you invited guests, I had to come, so I can only play four rounds of mahjong before leaving today. Tonight, the XX Theater is showing the XX movie, which is extraordinarily good-looking, and I sacrificed myself for you."</p>
<p>It turned out that Mrs. Zhang's invitation to guests was not what it seemed. The purpose was to gather gambling friends. So, after the banquet was over, the ladies, misses, and young mistresses gathered around. Pai Gow, mahjong, until dawn, the gambling game in Zhang's mansion was dispersed.</p>
<p>On a faintly illuminated XX Road with some hazy conditions, a young woman ran out of the gate of Zhang's mansion, jumped into the rickshaw at the door, and a dozing rickshaw puller, like a lost soul, desperately pulled, and ran forward.</p>
