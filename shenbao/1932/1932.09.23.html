<p>時評</p>
<h3>解决國際問題之新途徑元</h3>
<p>路透電訊日内瓦軍縮主幹部。今日舉行公開會議。討論對德態度事。主席漢德森稱。「軍縮會巳屆喫緊階叚。各代表宜闢一新途徑前進。但此新途徑之决定。極關重要。非導成和平。即釀成軍備競爭。結果將出於戰之一途。和戰之分。繫此一舉。」漢氏之言。誠爲切要。惟以今日情勢論。非特軍縮問題。應闢一新途徑。即我東亞之中日問題。亦應速定一妥善之新途徑否則即陷於破壞和平而引起戰爭之危險。其事蓋實相同而亦相連也。</p>
<p>今姑以軍縮問題論。漢氏認德之軍備平等要求。性質重大。如仍各懷私意以敷衍手叚出之者。必有决裂之危險。故必另闢一新途徑。其主張非不深切情勢。然吾謂欲覓取新途徑第一須先消弭國際間矛盾之現象。列强自發起軍縮以來。隨地發現矛盾。各國所提之重要軍縮案。無一不爲衛巳防人之工具。軍縮旣不誠意。自難冀矛盾之幸免。英政府對於軍縮。向稱與美一致者也。今仍表同情於美乎。抑表同情於法乎美政府普减三分之一之主張。德曾表同情者也。今德之平等主張。美果亦同情於德乎。抑同情於法乎。今日之問題。關鍵全在英美。而英尤處全局之中心。英之主張定。英美一致之主張定。言動不矛盾。表裏不矛盾。而後乃有新途徑可謂。蓋所謂新途徑者。不外使列强對德。能一致諒解。予德國以自動取消不出席主張之機會。欲德國取消不出席之主張。必先使反對德國主張之强國。覺悟固執抗爭之危險。而有懸崖勒馬之心也。今日最不表同情於德者惟法耳。英美能以一致之主張。調處於德法之間。德必能緩和其態度。而法亦必有相當之讓步。故英美所處之地位。確有左右勢局之能力也。</p>
<p>且英美一致之能力。非僅足以開闢歐洲方面之新途徑。亦足以開闢東亞方面之新途徑。日本今日所極力引爲巳助者亦惟法耳。英美能與法一致動作。日本雖强。自必有所顧慮。而不敢任意妄爲。據今日路透所述倫敦電訊謂法政府已改變其對中日之遠東政策。將抛棄其對於日本行爲之幕後扶助。而堅守國聯會章。法官塲負責發言人。亦聲明從未改變白里安擁護國聯尊嚴之政策。果如此是法國未嘗無與英美合作以應付東亞問題之意。英美苟以公平合理之主張要約法國。則亦不難覓得解决東亞問題之新途徑也。惟美國對法表示。尙欲以對德軍備問題。爲遠東對日問題之交換。則此後恐國際間尙多波折耳。</p>

<p>美允助法拒德軍備要求</p>
<p>作爲助美對日壓迫交換</p>
<p>調查報告倘於日本不利</p>
<p>日人宣稱决定退出國聯</p>
<p>路透二十二日倫敦電彙聞報日内瓦今晨訪電稱、法政府巳改變其對中日之遠東政策、將抛棄其對於日本行爲之幕後扶助、而堅守國聯會章、因法國現主張在對德軍備問題上嚴格適用國聯會章也　　國民社二十一日華盛頓電頃悉美政府現正悄然探測歐洲各大國政府對於滿洲近事之意見、聞美國遠東政策固無根本變更意、但其反對日本之程度、殆將視國際聯盟尤其英法兩國擁護現行條約之程度爲轉移、</p>
<p>路透社二十二日巴黎電法官塲發言人今晨對路透社訪員言及近日所傳法國將改變其對遠東與國聯之政策一說、發表負責言論、謂法國遵守白里安關於東三省之宣言、從未須臾考慮承認「滿洲國」事、法國現竚待李頓報告書、而遵行國聯之决議、故法國遠東政策之變更、實不成問題、蓋今日法國之態度、猶是去秋白里安所宣布之態度也、發言人又聲明兩點、第一、法國始終擁護國聯關於遠東條約權利之决議第二、法國對於東三省從未有與美國意見不同之處、故目前並無所謂法國傾向美國之問題、查白里安一年前所宣布之政策、旨在和平解决滿洲問題、今日發言人言及白里安去年十一月十六日在國聯行政院開會時及國聯决定選派調查團時所發之言論、謂白里安雖已逝世、法國仍服從國聯、並擁護國際義務之尊嚴、發言人一再聲明法國政策始終如一、外傳變更政策之說、純屬荒謬之談云、</p>
<p>電通社二十二日東京電據可靠消息、美參院議員李德對法總理提議、謂美國對戰債問題、允考慮法國之立塲、法國對中日問題、亦望維持美國之立塲云云、此爲日本承認滿洲僞國後、美國務卿史汀生之不承認主義表現、美國務院之態度、係鑑於内外批評之不良、圖挽回之、俾利用於總統選舉、美總統胡佛意欲引誘法國、俾法國領導國聯而壓迫日本、法總理對此提議、其對日與對美態度正在考慮中、在今秋對美戰債支付期前、甚較重大、最近法外交部機關報「譚」巳漸露反日態度、故法國　態度殊堪重視、</p>
<p>路透二十一日紐約電代理駐華盛頓日大使齋藤今日在此聲稱、如李頓報告書之性質、迫令日本退出國聯、則日本之退出、不作一分鐘之猶豫、如李頓調查團洞鑒眞相、則日本實無所恐云、</p>

<p>華聯社二十二日東京電日外交部本定將「日滿條約」與「議定書」、送國聯秘書處註册、最近因各國主張維持公理者逐漸抬頭、並且日又恫嚇在前、所以送與不送、目前日外交部尙在躊躇中、結局只有靜候國聯開會情形始能决定策略云、</p>
<p>承認僞組織</p>
<p>蘇俄提示條件</p>
<p>廢止戰爭與宣傳赤化</p>
<p>日本决難接受</p>
<p>據大阪每日新聞載稱、自日政府承認滿洲僞國後、繼而起者恐爲俄國、但俄國之承認滿洲、巳有交換條件提出、日政府因其條件苛刻、巳拒絶磋商、故巳陷於停頓之勢、蓋内田外相以與滿洲接壞之鄰邦俄國、關係甚大、迭次勸誘俄國承認滿洲、而俄政府乘内田暗示機會、即將犬養時代所提出之互不侵犯條約、以爲承認之交換條件、但日政府因俄國所提之不侵犯條約、包含廢止戰爭之規定、其與日本國策主義上固完全相反、且俄國要求日本不能禁止第三國際之對日對滿宣傳赤化、因此政府當局勸誘俄國承認滿洲之念、巳無考慮之餘地云、</p>
<p>電通二十二日東京電滿洲國外次大橋忠一之赴哈爾濱、傳係關於中東路問題、俄滿兩國間根本的解釋發生異議之故、惟據另一消息、因蘇聯承認滿洲國之機運巳熟、將以隨承認而發生之基本條項爲中心、如（一）以中東路爲主體之中俄奉俄兩恊定、究應如何處理之問題、（一）俄滿兩國間設立不可侵犯條約之問題等、與俄國總領事爲内交涉云、</p>

<p>路透社二十二日東京電長春來電稱、朝日新聞長春訪員所傳之消息、實無根據、惟聞「滿洲國」政府現方草擬一種商約、而希望與列强談判、又擬一入冬令、即實施大規模剿匪計畫、使外人得安居樂業、藉獲列强之信任云、</p>

<p>路透二十一日日内瓦電軍縮會主幹部因主席漢德森之一再主張、今日舉行公開會議、此創舉也、德國態度雖爲目前最大問題、仍未議及、蓋漢德森以爲主幹部應予德國以答覆其九月十八日去函之機會、不宜遽即討論其缺席事也、漢德森於開會時聲稱、軍縮會現巳屆吃緊階級、各代表宜闢新途徑前進、但須知其新途徑之决定、極關重要、非導成和平、即釀成軍備競爭、而軍備競爭之結果、祗爲戰爭、故前途之和戰繫此一舉云、法總理赫禮歐由巴黎來此、原擬與會、以便參加德國態度之討論、今因此事暫緩討論、故未出席、今日將回巴黎、星期一日可返日内瓦出席國聯大會、軍縮會主幹部之會議、午後討論以七月二十三日通過各案爲根據之工作程度、查七月二十三日所通過者、爲（一）歡迎胡佛總統縮减軍備三分之一之提議、（二）依允禁止天空攻擊及化學　菌與焚燒之戰爭、（三）主張陸砲口徑與担克車重量之限制、（四）主張永久軍備委員會之成立、（五）請華盛頓與倫敦兩海軍公約簽字國會商續减海上軍備、俄代表李維諾夫堅請根據俄國或美國提議、討論立即裁軍問題、但會衆卒採用審查員所條陳之辦法、主幹部至晚七時休會、定明晨十一時復議、秘書長將草擬一文、以表示化學戰爭委員會討論進行之程度、　　赫禮歐</p>
<p>來去怱怱啟人疑竇</p>
<p>國民社廿一日日内瓦電法總理赫禮歐今晨甫抵日内瓦、今晚復啓程返里昻、來去怱怱、大滋外間疑竇、據英人消息則稱、法總理此來、僅欲倡議調查所謂德國秘密軍備者、因英内閣中對此意見不一致、不得要領、廢然而返、又聞新聞記者於赫氏臨行前、叩以此來目的、赫氏出於含忿態度、答稱渠來日内瓦、因欲親覘是否有事發生、今見無事發生、故離此而出、按赫氏此語、亦可視爲間接微實法總理曾與德外長作長談、但德人拒絶讓出軍備平等問題之謠傳、</p>
<p>德政府</p>
<p>堅持軍備均等要求</p>
<p>國民社二十一日柏林電德政府對於軍備平等問題、不肯退讓尺寸之决心、復於今日「自由之路」報端所刋外長牛賴資一文可見、牛氏在結論中宣稱、關於我人决意堅持平等要求、要無可以懷疑之處、又謂軍縮談判、已因强大武裝各國不願踐行凡爾賽和約、與國聯盟約規定之軍縮保證、陷於完全僵局、德國曾在日内瓦耐心力倡仿照德國普通軍縮、並要求應用平等原則、其意義即倘若軍縮公約不符凡爾賽和約所定標準、必須允許德國軍備平等之權、苟否認此種根本權利、是將國分爲優劣二等、最後又謂、德國之接受凡爾賽和約軍縮規定、僅因其爲一種臨時方案、將代以國際總軍縮故、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十一日柏林電德國政府不參加軍縮會之决定雖未改變、然自英國通牒及胡佛宣言之後、德政府深知各方外交談判、與德國改組陸軍計書所關非淺、德國避不參加甚覺困難、據可靠方面消息、德政府之意、似表面上仍堅持其軍備平等之要求、惟籨訂凡爾賽和約之國家、如能承認在軍縮最後公約中列入條欵、以代凡爾賽條約之第五部、則德國即可認爲滿意、如各國對德國保證能如此辦理、則德國代表可立時再行出席日内瓦會議、至於公約中所擬列入之條欵、尙包含德國之要求、其大致如下、（一）陸軍服役年限减爲六年、（二）德國現被禁止設置之軍備、如砲·飛機·坦克車·潛水艇等、在一定期限内加以廢止、其限期不妨稍長、但必須明白規定、（三）以摩托車隊代騎兵等等、按德國陸軍經費巳甚充裕、即有此項變更、亦不致增加經費、由此要求、可見施萊轍歷次驚人宣言中所陳說之計畫、其主旨不在裁軍問題、而在擴充德國之兵力也、</p>
<p>俄代表</p>
<p>李維諾夫對德同情</p>
<p>國民社二十一日日内瓦電今日下午軍縮會議主幹委員會開會後、俄代表李維諾夫對於德國不出席深表惋惜、指德代表空座言曰、此位空置良覺可悲、並謂主幹委員會可以通過一决議案、贊成德人平等要求之公允、藉以開啓德國復來赴會途徑、按此次因主席漢德森不願在德國答復其十八日去函以前討論此事、故迄今祗有李維諾夫發表數語、迨李氏演說畢、委員會即從事討論議程、其中最要議案、爲美總統軍縮計劃將組織專門委員會審議、次爲規定大砲與坦克車之最大實力、及對於各海軍國是否願於續减噸位繕製報告二案、</p>
<p>主幹會昨繼續集議</p>
<p>討論盡視軍備問題</p>
<p>路透二十二日日内瓦電軍縮軍議主幹部今晨十一時復開會討論一切、由漢德森主席、今晨演說者多注重監視軍備問題、主幹部巳派比代表草擬關於此事之報告書、俄代表李維諾夫否認蘇俄反對監視問題、並謂蘇俄匪特不反對、且願嚴密監視、並容納職聯工聯與公共團體之代表襄助監視、蘇俄政府更願監督軍備委員會勿容軍事當道加入云、</p>
<p>德國陸軍秋操</p>

<p>哈瓦斯二十一日孟買電甘地絶食期間、將以蜂蜜溶熱水中作爲飲料、絶食之前、甘地發表宣言書、說明决意絶食之理由、甘地在書中表示希望渠能支持多日、俾其呼籲之聲上達天聽、以促英國之感悟、而合印度人民幡然醒覺、如印度人終不願與賤民處絶對平等地位、則渠仍將絶食以死云、又甘地爲謀與賤民中巴里阿族締結盟約計、乃在宣言書中、要求在全國境内舉行一種公開大示威運動云、印度人與賤民間談判、仍頗接近、有成立折衷辦法之望、蓋巴里阿族首領安倍特卡博士態度、巳較前和緩也、在此間開會之印度人領袖會議、頃巳擬就一種折衷方案、以普通投票權及特别議席之當選權、給予賤民、孟買會議特派代表團來晤甘地、以方案交其審核、</p>

<h3>西行記（廿五）</h3>
<p>剝蝕之劇烈　據前所述、現在重要河流、如洛水延水等、皆發生於三門系紅色土沉積之後、在地文學上、此時期名曰淸水期、基時代乃介於黃土與紅色土之間、淸水期距今約數十萬年、在此較短時期之内、已能造大規模之河谷、可知陜北剝蝕作用之劇烈、更觀各處高原分割之零落、與夫深溝夾谷之密布、一細谷之生、往往僅需數小時之暴雨、即能成之、於此更可見剝蝕進行之神速、蓋陜北之浮面地層、極多鬆弱、而坡急岸高、風雨更易爲力、剝蝕之烈、自在意中、但因此而原野被陷、良田化爲廢壤、谷溝縱橫、交通爲之阻塞、此與實業之開發、其影響爲何如耶、故爲根本計、當對此剝蝕作用、設法限制、以免良田之消失、土壤之剝落、其救治之法、當以造林治水二者爲最要、此固人之所熟知者也、</p>
<p>鑛産之分布　陜北自侏羅紀起、未嘗受造山運動之影響、故地盤穩固火山及火成岩漿侵入之作用、俱無由發生、因之五金鑛産、如金銀銅鐡錫等鑛、就學理上言、根本無産生之可能、據今所知惟一重要之鑛産、當推石油與煤、延長石池、全國聞名、開辦以來、己逾二十餘年、成績尙佳、但以困於交通、限於經濟、僅能小規模開採、供給附近之需用、未可稱爲新式鑛業、惟陜北産油之區不止延長一處、若延川膚施等縣、俱有豐富之油泉或油苗湧現、至少足證石油之存在、若能用科學方法、詳細採勘、或有發現大油田之可能、但此項工作、需時甚久、非茲倉促旅行所能從事、至於煤鑛則除同官韓城二縣所産石炭二疊紀之煤層外、其餘侏羅紀所産、所以層薄質劣、斷續不定、分布過不規則、除爲小規模之土法開採外、或無價值之可言、</p>
<p>未來之發展　陜西未來發展之途徑、從上述觀之、厥惟畜牧與農林、陜北盆地旣大部分爲黃土及紅色土所成、故土壤厚而且肥、又因草原廣漠、適於蓄牧、地勢高峻、雨量較豐、近年來關中各縣、時苦旱災、而陜北各縣、從未以災象聞者蓋土壤肥美、雨水豐足之所賜也、但現在因交通不便之故、人口稀少、荒地過多、實爲將來農業發展之絶佳機會、當予調查時、目覩自富平蒲縣等處、向北遷移之難民、不絶於途、又詢諸各縣縣長、陜北人民、大多係客籍而少土著、可知陜北實能容納多數之移民、而尙無人口之過剩、誠能修明政治、以保閭里、減輕雜稅、與民休養、則五年之後、陜北當爲西北之樂土、</p>

<h3>尋覓公理</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>上窮碧落下黄泉，兩處茫茫都不見丨</p>
<p>借用白香山的兩句詩，說有一個弱者在那裏尋覓公理；公理是弱者的救星，弱者尋覓公理，便是尋覓救星。無奈，上窮碧落，下及黃泉，竟覓不到這顆弱者的救星丨</p>
<p>聽得太平洋的那一岸，有一顆弱者的救星喚做公理：弱者便渡過太平洋去尋覓這位公理先生，央求他出一臂之力。這位公理先生只是點點頭兒·道一句明白了。弱者又央求他發揮公理的力量，公理先生笑着說：</p>
<p>向你點點頭兒道一句明白了，便呌做公理。須知公理二字解作「乃公自有道理」。你不須央求了，公理，公理，乃公自有道理。弱者不得要領、又聽得第二位公理先生，住在大西洋的那一岸；弱者便渡過大西洋，去懇求第二位公理先生，助他一臂之力；第二位公理先生只說：不便干預，若要干預，還須有待。弱者忙問；什麽时候，才能夠發揮公理的力量？第二位公理先生打了一個呵欠道：</p>
<p>你要我援手，還没有到相當的時機；須知公理二字，解作：「天下爲公以後，才能理會這樁事。」你不須央求了，公理，公理，待到天下爲公，我來理會你的事。</p>
<p>弱者益發失望，又聽得第三位公理先生是住在地中海的那一岸；他又渡過地中海，去懇求第三位公理先生，助他一臂之力；第三位公理先生，突然怒形於色，向着弱者大聲斥駡道：</p>
<p>我正要來尋你，你却自己跑上我的門來；快把你的生命財産，一一交付與我們三位公理先生！以後你便没有主權了！須知公理二字，解作「公共管理」。公理，公理，便是把你弱者的生命財産，一一都歸我們公理先生公共管理。</p>

<p>對不住溥儀先生雖然現在日人卵翼捉弄之下，作了所謂滿洲國的執政，並且這所謂滿洲國者，最近還得了日人的正式承認，居然要充一充獨立國家（？）了丨然而蒲扇大的手，掩不了全世界的耳目，究竟他這滿洲國，能不能算作一個國家？還有待於公論的裁判，關起大門作皇帝，那些小孩子舉動，終究是算不了一回事。旣是這樣，我們這位溥儀先生，在中華民國没有驅他脫離國籍之先，無論如何，他還是我們中國人，並且是中國第一個可憐人！</p>
<p>怎見得溥儀先生是中國第一可憐人咧？中國人最可憐的，現在自然要算東北的三千萬同胞，但是他們還能奮起抗日，最不濟的，也能輾轉設法，逃進關内，只有溥儀先生，却是行動坐臥，完全失却自由，不但逃不能逃！并且死不得死！他的地位，早已有他自己說明「比傀儡還不如！」今天報載，他又對人說「實在幹不下去了！」其實所謂一幹不下去，」還是「不如傀儡」一語，來得切實沈痛。因爲他從離去天津，押赴滿洲，直至就任執政，和日人簽訂承認約章爲止，數月以來，他何曾幹過什麽？更進一步說：「他的一舉一動，一言一語，那一事，不是被人幹的？僅僅幹不下去，究竟還是試着幹過來，如今他却根本不曾幹，不能幹，并且是被人幹，這眞所謂不如傀儡了！</p>
<p>照此說來，中國的溥儀先生，果然是第一可憐人！就是換句話說，尊他一聲滿洲國的溥大執政，也還是滿洲三千萬人中的第一可憐人！</p>
<h3>蟀蟋吟</h3>
<p>— 淸</p>
<p>唉！你一隻小小的秋蟲，在那瓦礫荒凉細草中·瞿瞿呌得聲洪，好像狡兎，藏身窟窿·又像木鷄，秉性孤忠。</p>
<p>····················</p>
<p>唉！你一隻小小的秋蟲，倒也像張牙舞爪的英雄·可憐你使盡八面的威風，遇着頑童·就入牢籍。</p>
<p>························</p>
<p>唉！你一隻小小的秋蟲，還在黑地裏做着好夢·聽人撮弄，自殘同種·笑佗一般亡國的諸公，挖盡腰包，擲你一喙中。</p>
<h3>離子與麗子</h3>
<p>— 泛汝</p>
<p>丨記文王大過一次丨</p>
<p>易經上說「離麗也」，我們都加上一個「子」字，那就變成「離子者麗，子也」</p>
<p>離子是近代科學中認爲有陰陽之分的一種造物原素，而且不論是陰的與陽的，都時時的在求和異性相結合，那當然，倘有些須之機可乘，他們與她們便宜告合併了，古人稱美女爲麗子，可見美妙的女郎是特能赤裸裸的表現出她們的「離子性」，摩登的少女爲了要奪得「麗子」之稱，便充分的表演着她們的離」</p>
<p>子性」譬如赤裸裸的玉腿，喜馬拉亞山似的乳峯，都無非是拿來表現這「離麗也」的聖人之義、但男子却因此而易於引誘得犯法，這當然是都遭文王之害的·因爲人們都說易經上的卦辭爲文王所撰，所以我在這裏暫記文王大過一次</p>

<p>「我從來没有這麽沉悶過，想不到回家會有那樣結果，那四圍的一切絶對同在上海兩樣了，任便什麽都覺得是同外面隔絶了，眞的到了四川，簡直另外到了個世界」新近由四川出來的女友頴冰女土劈頭就這樣向我們說。</p>
<p>「我眞懊悔失掉了在上海游水的機會·唉，朋友，」伊異常失望地重重加以嘆息。</p>
<p>「……如果你要認爲我是你們想像那般的快樂時，那就完全錯誤了，誰有你們在上海的寫意，有紅綠的女郎們盡量地表現來讓你欣賞，我那兒除了整天看見不開化的人們些，什麽都没有，休說摩登了，」老同學陳君在常州做事，後來上海的感慨。</p>
<p>「萍，我覺得像走入了沙漠，雖然那兒是我親愛的家鄉，但是那能滿足我的一切呢，我轉來了，我回到美麗的上海懷抱來了，朋友，今夜去Ｍajestic，玩個痛快，我請客，跳到天亮吧，」才去南京某某部工作的一位同學王君乘了快車趁禮拜六，來上海這樣的邀請。</p>

<h3>好靑年應有之性格</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>我們靑年當中，對於一些事物，漫不加察的，眞不知有多少丨偏執的性格，養成了他們很少用精密的方法抉擇一下的微弱判斷力丨造成了人間世的種種罪惡丨比方有許多事理，明明白白是虚搆的，或固執着一己濃厚的主觀色彩的佈置而演映的；然而他們却據以爲眞，信之不疑丨這種性格，的確是再危險没有的丨</p>
<p>我以爲凡是一個好靑年，應有用理智所陶鑄成的堅决果敢的性格：就是說：凡我人的立身，處世，志向，行事等等，我人看得通通亮，認爲正當的，偉大的，即須百折不回，通往直前的邁進：倘使志不成，事不立，或動輒惹人誤解，都所不顧，亦無所用其追悔；反過來說：一切的一切，凡經過我精密理智從正面，反面，側面，多方面考慮後，覺察出不對的時候，就應當急流通退，萬没有須臾躊躇與徘徊的餘地：這樣，纔算是好靑年的性格：這種性格，彷彿是成功之路的發動機上的原動力！</p>
<h3>說部扶輪會銀絲（二十二）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>（十一）</p>
<p>袁團長到以後，他們的節目，經許多人討論，認爲揭幕還是在最後一節，尤其是縣長所竭力主張，因爲先揭幕後演說，那些村民一定都一鬨而散，演說將無人願聽，於會場秩序固然不好，對於袁團長的面子，也狠不好看。</p>
<p>縣長並不是主席，因爲這是民衆的集會，但是他讀總理遺囑，他說的話，都似乎是主席的身份。諸伯方心裏狠不快活，但是也無可如何。</p>
<p>袁團長自己有一段演說，台下聽的人，個個都自動拍手，他是這麽說的：「我們當軍人的，等於一個女子嫁了一個丈夫，女子嫁了丈夫，在我們中國的舊規矩，是不許離婚的；旣然不許離婚，無論如何受苦，是活該的。所以我們當了軍人，是應該把身體性命屬於國家，一寸土地都不能讓别國奪去，守土是我們的職責，這是應該的，無所謂榮譽；何况這裏又是我的桑梓，怎麽不拚死力守住呢？承蒙各位父老兄弟姊妹，捐欵建築紀念碑，眞是不敢當，使我十分慚愧，十分感謝……」鎭上的人，舊禮敎還充滿着他們的舊　筋，所以大拍其手。　　但是諸綺蘭小姐，聽了，心裏感到說不出的難受。伊從小便由伯方給伊定了一頭親，伊的未婚夫是鎭上開油醬南貨舖的小老板，在當地小學校畢了業以後，没有升中學，而諸綺蘭却在上海的一個貴族化的敎會女子中學已畢業了。伊對於這一件婚姻，十分不滿意，伊不願去當油醬舖的小老板娘；伊所希望的丈夫，是要有錢，有勢，最好是一位狠著名的官員；所以伊在這時，堅决地要求解除婚約。恰巧這位油醬店小老板，倒也狠洒脫，並且對於諸綺蘭的驕奢態度，也看不上眼，所以便允許雙方無條件的解除婚約。現在諸綺蘭聽到袁團長的演說，臉上不覺紅了一陣，心中微吃一驚，伊料想不到袁團長的腦筋，是這樣頑固；但是他受全鎭的人崇拜，也受全國人的稱頌，因爲他是抗敵的英雄，業己成名，他當着團長，一定也狠富裕，正適合伊所需要找尋的丈夫的資格。伊認定了目標，想從此進行伊的希望使成事實。　　台下也有人認識袁團長，似乎從前鎭上有一個窮書生袁和甫，便是袁瘋子的丈夫，但是從前的袁和甫，已失踪了好幾年，究竟是不是他，台下人只有竊竊私議，而無人敢高聲地講，也無人敢據實地向袁團長問。</p>
<p>但是諸綺蘭年齡與袁團長相差一倍之多，伊是完全不知道袁和甫一會事的，伊自己早已考慮過，年齡再差得大些，也没有關係，現代的靑年女子，嫁一個年齡狠大的官員是狠流行，而且狠光榮的。伊要當塲顯露自己的才具，而誘引袁團長注意或愛伊，决定也演說一番。</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米市提高殺次</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮來船十餘號、市形不振新粳到稀、大盤頓提一二角、中關貨亦昂角許、常錫來函、糙米價格趨緊、人心向上、靑解薄稻及嘉善西塘等貨、統提一角洋杜尖經客帮購辦、積貨見空、價说提起角許、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日來貨不多、船貨存底共約一萬五千担光景、本街交易呆滯、新陳北粳見漲一二角、刻下普通一致趨緊、薄稻到源益稀、城鄉進胃雖平、價則又昂角許、客尖零拆極佳、價無漲跌、新洋杜尖大都以小絞米爲代用品、變元無榮辱、</p>
<h3>粉市頭盤奇俏</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份突呈激昂之勢、以洋麥報價、回漲五角至八九角左右之巨、故開盤後、人心卽見挺貴、較前日收價、無形提高一二分、惟廠家雖未暢出福新則隨市微有抛出、因此上午交易、全集中于開盤、以後各盤、均見盤旋、迨至下午開盤、本月份曾一度見軟、遠期各月份因廠家不動、交易又趨停頓、市價幾無出入、觀察後步、仍看洋麥爲轉多、並須看廠家之是否定洋麥也、結果本月份較前日漲七厘半、十月份漲一分半、十一月份漲一分二厘半、十二月份至二月份各漲一分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>麥市晨緊午懈</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後、各月份呈堅俏之象、以洋麥報價、反漲五角至八九角左右、傳洋麥報漲、聞係美方選舉關係、提高哦價、照此推想、亦無非人心所合然、市塲開價時、本月份初價祗四錢七分、後因買戶見湧、價亦堅起、惟遠期已無形帶高、不過交易未見大暢、趨勢依然鬆懈、迨至下午開盤、市勢已轉停頓、與上午收價、幾少上落、後步如洋麥仍有變動難期過高、結果本月份較前日漲三分、十月份漲四分、十一月份漲二分、十二月份至二月份各漲四分、現麥大致穩固、交易亦見活絡、開瑤灣麥三兩五錢二分、通州麥三兩三錢半、蚌埠麥三兩五錢、紹興麥三兩三錢七分、崇明麥三兩三錢七分、共計二千五百包云、</p>
<p>南北貨　新桂圓高貨軋缺</p>
<p>前日所到泉州新泡元一千二百餘箱、茲查各號均有到貨、惟以上檔寥寥、市勢轉緊、中下檔有廣東漳州同安等處到來、爲數頗多、驟覺供過於求、市價反見疲跌、大約今日可以開通、高貨當在三十兩以外、</p>
<p>糖市　粗砂白跌二分半</p>
<p>昨日糖市以荷滙雖平、標金已見銳跌、故公會劃盤趨勢轉平、二十四號粗砂白劃十四兩五錢七分半、比前日小二分半、特别高貨劃十四兩七錢二分半、廿號中砂白十四兩、號盤漸靑九兩二錢、稍有開出、比前略小、洋刁靑貨品尙佳、但因别路靑糖正在跌價、故行號雙方意見尙未接近、致成　局、</p>
<p>絲茶無錫新廠經陸續運滬</p>
<p>日内己運到二百餘件…預備月底交解</p>
<p>無錫全邑絲廠、共達五十三家、新繭上市後、勉强復工者共祗十餘家、上月中歐美絲銷轉機、各絲廠紛紛復業、全邑開工之絲廠現已達二十四家、絲産漸增、茲以九月底轉瞬卽屆、各絲廠承抛歐美各莊之本月份期絲、亟應依期交解、故均將存絲陸總運滬、最近兩三日無錫新廠經巳運到二百四十五件預備月終交解洋莊、至本埠洋莊絲市、近因海外絲銷不起、市價步跌、去電不轉、續呈疲靜、</p>
<p>紅綠茶一致趨跌</p>
<p>昨日洋莊茶交易依然淸淡、各歐莊對於祁寗紅茶及路莊土莊綠茶、認價苛緊如昨、珍眉一項、婺源貨跌至百兩左右、屯溪貨跌至八十餘兩、歙縣貨跌至七十餘兩、市面悲觀、祁花香末去路久呆、昨聞英商同孚天裕錦隆等行、對於花香一項、已有電報發出、定價爲九兩、至他項紅茶、依然無人問及云、</p>
<p>疋頭　毡呢底市銷激增</p>
<p>昨日呢絨市面尙佳、毡呢毡底售價與前上幾週一般堅俏、董到存不多、市銷瀨增、桃紅·靑綠·水灰等顔色、非常挺俏、夾色毡呢因售價太昂、反有回疲之象、昨泰和大總統寗豐靑天圖俱喊售六兩四錢半、寗豐毡底七兩五錢、咪吔牌爲十二兩七錢半、</p>
<p>五金　竹節鋼成交二百噸</p>
<p>昨日五金市情依然蕭索、大宗貨品開出仍少、蓋銀根緊迫、各地鬧共剿匪致生意難見進展、而向所主重之煙台去路、最近因轉韓劉互鬨致該帮來電停辦停裝、在臨近之靑島、濟南諸帮、亦來電止辦、是以北路生意、堪稱斷絶、南路交易、自中秋節後、亦無新進展、所幸邇來各市進出兩微、致標準賴以站立而不跌也、茲述其主要者于後、</p>
<p>建築帮辦竹節鋼二百餘噸　建築帮新仲記·桂蘭記·新金記諸號帮、昨在茶會購進竹節鋼條二百三十餘噸、其價係抛去月底期貨、故較現市便宜二兩、計每噸扯價爲六十三兩五錢聞售出者係北蘇州路一埭五金號云、</p>
<p>黑鐡皮去路蠢蠢欲動　金風送寒、梧桐葉落、北路客幫爲防寒起見、多採辦黑鐡皮以供作火爐火炬之用、出路甚廣、惟今庚終以金融緊迫、成交大遜、連日開出不多、惟比之先前呆木氣象、則已覺有蠢蠢欲動之槪、聞開出價十八張正號每担估八兩五錢、副號每担八兩、三六尺三張至八張估八兩二錢半、九張十張八兩七錢半、十一張至十三張九兩二錢半云、</p>

<h3>惲蕙芳案判决</h3>
<p>判處徒刑三月</p>
<p>上訴期内保釋</p>
<p>丨厲律師持論允當丨</p>
<p>丨汪首席論告公平丨</p>
<p>靑年惲蕙芳、因以爆裂物警告奸商、前被華界警察逮捕、輾轉移提至第一特區地方法院、准予保釋各情、迭記前報、</p>
<p>法院戒備嚴密　昨日午後、爲該案繼續審理之期、法院當局、鑒於以前數度開庭時、旁聽者擁擠之狀態、爲維持秩序相見、命令中西法警、分佈於第一法庭内外、嚴密糾察、而公共租界警務當局、則遴派大隊武裝中西印探捕、由中西督察長姚家琳·辛克來·督率駕警備汽車、駛至法院門首、除飭一部份探捕下車、協助法警、在院内週圍加崗外、餘或散佈院門外附近或駐車中、戒備之嚴厲、防範之周妥可見一斑、但旁聽人士、則因此項緊張之空氣、頗多望而却步、故第一法庭尙不覺十分擁擠約計旁聽者可二三百人、</p>
<p>惲蕙芳之丰采　至二時十分、惲蕙芳偕親友五人到庭、惲衣深藍色條子布中山裝、髮新剪、容光益形煥發、而且笑容可掬、入庭後、即座於後排人叢中、然仍爲觀衆所注意、一時視線咸集於其身、此際捕房律師甘鏡先·厲志山·與被告律師李祖虞·沈鈞儒·趙琛·及經辦之中西探員、皆巳到齊、遂由刑一庭庭長錢鴻業·首席檢察官汪祖澤·偕同書記官升座、命將惲蕙芳帶至被告欄、立而受鞫、</p>
<p>宣告更新審理　先訊明其年籍住址、隨即宣告本案今日更新審理、於是捕房起訴律師厲志山（按此案本爲汝葆彝律師辦理、現汝律師以例假赴鄉間休息、未能趕到出庭、故改由厲·甘·一君接辦、）起而聲稱、現控被告之罪有三、即爲（一）違犯刑法第二百八十二條第二項殺人未遂罪、（二）違犯刑法三百十八條妨害自由罪、（三）違犯刑法二百條持有爆裂物、而供犯罪之用罪、查其妨害自由罪之發生時期爲七月二十七日上午十一時、因被告將恐嚇信一封及置於方形洋鐡罐内之手溜彈一枚親送往山西路棉布公所、經該公所茶役接收、被告不待其詰問、反身而逃、嗣公所中人閱悉函内多警告語、連同該罐、併送捕房、騐得罐内炸彈、甚富爆發力、</p>
<p>永昌鄭彈事件　至七月二十八晨、被告又與蔡耀祖往新閘路、以炸彈抛入永昌煤號、頓時爆發、炸傷該號雇員一人、以上兩案、捕房初固不知乃被告所爲、直至八月五日、被告因投彈於法租界茂昌洋布莊、被捕後、由總稽查處向第二特院聲請、提至捕房偵查、始悉亦被告與在逃之蔡耀祖所同謀而實施者也、</p>
<p>捕房控訴根據　據被告在捕房自白、承認棉布公所之信與炸彈爲彼個人送去、永昌之案、當時係蔡抛擲炸彈、而彼僅在路旁望風、並述炸彈係充義勇軍退職時所留下、彼與蔡各兩枚、除用去三枚外、尙存一枚、在派克路二零七號寓所、當由探員帶同被告前去搜查、果得一枚、彼所犯向茂昌投彈之罪、業由第二特院判處徒刑二月、以其年輕、緩刑兩年、捕房乃根據被告之自白及調查之所得、而提起控訴云云、</p>
<p>西探長之報告　繼由西探長搿來勃氏報告、將被告自法租界提至捕房詰問後、根據其所供、分赴派克路二零七號被告與蔡耀祖所寓室内搜得炸　彈一枚、及至棉布公所永昌煤號兩處調查、由被告表演蔡耀祖當時擲彈之姿勢各項經過情形、並將恐嚇信洋鐡罐彈片各種證物呈案、而厲律師則將所攝永昌被投彈後之照片曁所繪之圖、一併提出、</p>
<p>朱阿山之陳述　旋傳證人棉布公所茶役朱阿山、訊以接受恐嚇信與洋鐡罐之情狀、據稱、其時係一靑年送來、口稱奉大人之命所遣、將物交我後、反身卽去、我當時對於罐内所藏、並無任何疑惑、及將信閱後、方知罐内爲炸彈、即報捕房、但該靑年之面目、因當時旣不及認　、今更難審識云云、</p>
<p>抛彈不欲傷人　錢庭長遂向被告訊問、據供、棉布公所之信及炸彈、由我送去、受者之容貌、巳不能記憶、當時我默無一言、因受者執我衣袖、急反身奔逃、信爲蔡耀祖書寫、故蔡對此舉亦同意、先是我等調查得該公所會員有販日貨行爲、乃致函警告之、因若輩置諸不理、故以炸彈相贈、倘猶不痛自改悔、最後一着、惟有將彈抛擲、但目的絶非欲傷人、僅圖損其物、設明知有人在塲、决不冒昧從事、所書信函、悉係血魂除奸團署名、事前巳兩致警告於該公所、因彼不悛悔、始以彈相貽、</p>
<p>到時彈巳爆發　七月廿八晨、蔡先往新閘路、始意亦係祗以炸彈相贈、迨我到時、詎巳爆發、故後曾向蔡詢問原因、據蔡言炸彈係用報紙包裹、深恐授受時被人所執、遂將彈抛入煤堆内、不意炸裂、誠屬意料之外、但我今所述、與前在捕房所言略有不同、實因彼時腦經錯亂、錢庭長即將被告在捕房之供詞宣讀、内有「蔡投炸彈時、我在路旁、」等詞、乃訊以究以何者爲準確、惲答應以今日所述爲實在至於後由探員帶往永昌表演投彈情形、則純係根據蔡於投彈後向我所言各點、而依樣葫蘆、蓋我到時巳在爆發之後、其如何投擲、絶對不知、况隔夜雖曾商議、然我僅知蔡係送彈往也、</p>
<p>惲蔡各有兩彈　至此由李祖處律師向惲詢問、據答稱義軍退時、我與蔡各帶來兩彈、我已將一彈送贈棉布公所、一彈投於茂昌號、祗餘蔡之兩彈、故贈永昌者、須用蔡彈、乃由蔡自送、蔡約二十歲、我則十六歲、蔡智識優於我、故我所爲、均先商之而蔡有事、則非胥我同意云、</p>
<p>是否妨害自由　錢庭長因人證俱已訊畢、諭令開始辯論、首由厲律師發言、略謂關於棉布公所案、係以刑法三百十八條妨害自由罪起訴、被告現巳承認、所需研究者、祗被告是否有此妨害他人自由之權利、根據現行約法第三十七條、人民有職業自由、倘其業務有背善良風俗或違反法律、自有國法制裁、若販賣日貨、爲個人之道德問題、且中日並未絶交、政府尤無禁止人民販賣日貨之命令、人民經商、絶對享受自由、若謂抵制日貨、則被告不以善意勸導、而出之以强暴威脅之行動、不得諉爲非犯罪、例如持有鴉片、固屬犯罪、而搶奪之者、當然亦係犯罪行爲、本案情形、亦猶是也、</p>
<p>供詞應請注意　至其殺人未遂、以捕房調查所得、與被告之自白、多屬相符、雖被告今日所供、與以前相反、然今皆爲空言、是否可信、應請加以注意、故此案被告與蔡耀祖事前旣同謀、臨事復在旁望風、斷爲洪同犯、顯無疑義、而所訴持有爆裂物之罪、旣搜有供犯罪用之炸彈一枚、罪亦成立無疑、</p>
<p>被告原可欽佩　查被告爲一靑年、所行所爲、原可欽佩、然就法律論、則屬犯罪舉動、人民對法律旣負遵守義務、故法律應予人民以保障、倘有侵犯人民自由、擾亂社會安寗者、當受法律製裁、是故事有在道德方面爲堪矜憫者、在法律方面未始非違法、販賣日貨雖係違反民衆心理、但究未觸犯法律、法庭爲執法所在、所望持法維平、不能因人而遷就法律、自此案發生以來、所謂某某除奸團之名目、巳多至四十餘種、彼輩名爲警告、實係犯法、如何遷就、危險孰甚、我國昔爲人治、今甫達法治、旣有犯者、自必懲之、以樹法治之精神、而維司法獨立之尊嚴、惟被告血氣方剛、且未成年、故科刑更望深切注意、</p>
<p>被告筆師辯護　次由李·沈·趙·律師各辯、趙先發言、滔滔申辯、偏重理論、李·沈·二君則就事實、一一剖白、槪括其大意、對於所控妨害自由罪、認爲與法租界一案有連續關係、應請予以免訴、對於殺人未遂部份、認係蔡耀祖所爲、惲不能負此責任、對於持有爆炸物、則以此係因他事而發現、且搜出之彈、非惲所有、自應與惲無涉、</p>
<p>汪首席之論告　末由汪首席論告、大旨謂妨害自由部份、實係連續行爲、應予免訴、殺人未遂部份、殊嫌適當、應以傷害罪判斷、至持有爆裂物部份、旣非一種單獨犯法行爲、自應與他罪併科、從一處斷云、</p>
<p>判處徒刑三月　錢庭長遂當庭宣判惲慧芳共同施用足以致死之方法傷害人一罪、減處徒刑三月、其被訴向山西路棉布公所抛擲炸彈恐嚇信一罪免訴、手溜彈一枚彈片没收銷毁、上訴期内、惲蕙芳交原保、判畢、仍由原保將惲保釋</p>

<h3>海州新港</h3>
<p>墟溝試航成功</p>
<p>大埔港實行廢棄</p>
<p>海州自開闢以來、大埔港爲商輪集中之點、隴海來貨、統由該處下船、轉運到滬、以前西北貨件、從長江與徐州轉載者、今悉從海州上船矣、惟是大埔海港、沙泥受潮浪之衝盪、時常變遷、近來汚積異常、輪行困難、隴海路局、遂改變地叚、移至墟溝、建築告成、爰將記者調查所得、詳述如下、</p>
<p>大埔水淺難航　大埔爲海州之水陸聯運港埠、上海各輪船、如招商大振合衆等局、均在該埠築有碼頭貨棧、而隴海路亦通支路、商輪火車可以聯運、貨件上下、十分利便、詎自去年起、海州大埔港之沙泥淤積日多、輪行至艱、在水淺之際、最小時僅有五英尺深、本年滬上各輪、常在大埔擱阻、遂致不能多運貨物、每次减裝三四成儎脚、稍予多裝、便不得進港、須用駁船轉運、至爲不便、</p>
<p>墟溝新埠造就　墟溝在大埔之西北、約四十哩、該港終年不凍、且吃水極深、潮落之時、亦有三十餘尺、爲海州天然良港、昔年隴海路局請德工程師設計開闢、估核新港工事、至少二千萬元、方可造就、上年錢局長以大埔難航、遂將墟溝港先行因陋就簡、施工開闢、止波堤首先築成、隴海路支幹亦於本年接通、並造一貨棧、建築一海關辦事室、至本月内各項工事巳粗具雛形、餘俟陸續增建、</p>
<p>路局派輪試行　墟溝港岸落成之日、隴海路局即擬將大埔港廢棄、以後各處商輪、均改赴新港、與路局聯運、貨物上落、統改至墟溝起卸、本月十二日由隴海路局試騐新港航道、經材料課派商輪一艘、載重三千噸、運裝隴海路之各項材料物品、由大埔港外改赴墟溝、該輪吃水在十七尺左右、試令駛進新港、試航結果、十分滿意、港内絶無阻隔、惟碼頭未竣、所差尙不能傍岸、暫用駁載、路局巳通告各公司、此後重儎船可開赴新港起卸、岸堤工事、完成即將大埔港全部改往墟溝、</p>

<h3>賣身投靠與記者</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>從昨天的「賣身投靠」，聯想到前日某君所談的「尶𡯓文人」，我拿來兩相比較，倒還是奴婢有身可賣，有靠可投，而一般的尶𡯓文人，眞是欲「賣身投靠」而不可得，還要尶𡯓。</p>
<p>所謂尶𡯓文人，换言之，就是一般長衫同志，在長衫同志當中，確也有幾個蜚黃騰達，闊綽異常，到底是少數的少數，我國文人之中，有幾個「幾身修到」的呢，此外眞是無聊極了，尶𡯓極了，假定欲去投筆從戎，則不懂得六韜三略，肩不能負槍，手不能放砲，若去挑葱賣菜，學農人的生活麽，肩架上擔不起斤量，并没有響亮而淸脆的嗓子去沿途呌賣，眞是好呌我左右爲人難呢。</p>
<p>幾位吃開口飯的敎員先生，亦無一而非尶𡯓文人，亦無一而非「賣身投靠」的朋友，天天拿了皮包，跑到學校裏去出堂唱，師生間感情好，還可，萬一感情不佳，幾位丘九先生，就要發脾氣，學校當局，生恐一理釀成風潮，經濟上不免感到影響，急急如令勒的一道「禁蓄奴婢」的命令下來，這個敎員眼晴就要「地牌式」，校長旣愛莫能助，敎員只能包頭鼠竄而去，不得巳只得别投胞胎，再去「賣身投靠」，這也是尶𡯓文人的末路。</p>
<p>我輩吃記者飯的人，何嘗不是「賣身投靠」，但是賣身投靠的幾位姐姐妹妹們，還有到了相當年齡去遣嫁的一日，我輩的「賣身投靠」還深恐主人因爲奉命不力，發也「禁蓄奴婢」之令，遣送回家，那時一只飯碗，就要打得粉碎，所以兩手拚命捧牢，萬一打碎，家内開門七件事，就要發生問題，而我輩尶𡯓文人，又無其他事業可做，結果不是到馬路傍邊去告地狀，便是擺個拆字攤頭，替阿金姐小阿囡等，寫幾封給某大少通欵曲的假情書，這也是尶𡯓文人的一條末路</p>
<p>更是可憐的，幾位投稿的先生們，他們本有「賣身投靠」的地盤，藉此爲副業的，不必說，或者家食自甘，舞弄筆墨，藉以發表意見的，又當除外，若没有地盤，專靠投稿維持生活的，眞是可憐極了，每日費盡心思，寫了一篇洋洋大文，鄭重封固，投諸郵筒，把望明日該報登出，豈知明天看看，報上没有，殊爲失望，後天看看，依舊是「音書信杳，黃犬音乖」不免由失望而怨怒，由怨怒而痛駡，萬一登出，自己拜讀拜讀，果然無啥，并且鞋襪錢雖然不夠，而香烟之資，總算藉以解决了，這也尶𡯓文人之一。</p>
<p>今天巳經寫的不少了，明天有空，當再寫下去，否則就此要告别了。</p>

<h3>蝕印術</h3>
<p>— 愼永</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>各種顔色花紋的衣料，是多麽的美麗，要是單靠着在紡織時的一些藝術，那末就是第一等的織工，也不能有現在布疋上那樣美麗的花紋，所以這完全是印染術的功勞啊丨但是在印染術中，除了直接印染法外，蝕印術就佔了很重要的地位，要在有色的布疋上，使牠有白色的花紋，用蝕印術比較容易得多：並且近來更發明了用蝕印法也能蝕印出有色彩的花紋來，所以這是對於紡織工業界上有很大的貢獻，不得不約略的介紹一下，</p>
<p>原來有錫鹽蝕印法及氣酸鹽蝕印法，近來又發明了氫氧化亞硫酸做蝕印劑中的重要藥品，這種藥品不但具有蝕性，而對於各種纎維也没有侵蝕的弊，現在且把毛織物，絲織物及棉織物的蝕印法分述如左：</p>
<p>一，毛織物蝕印法</p>
<p>羊毛織物的蝕印術，多用還用劑，但是羊毛纖維本具有弱還原性對於蝕印易發生阻礙，因此預備受蝕印術的毛織物，在未染色時，必須注意，先以織物浸入一種溶液内，其成分如下：</p>
<p>水丨三五○公升，氯化石灰液丨五·二公升，鹽酸液丨三·五公升，侵過一二次後，用淸水洗凈，若以鹽酸改爲硫酸更佳。洗凈後，侵入濃錫酸鈉液一小時，再侵入濃硫酸液，洗凈晾乾，而後染色，即可用還原劑使行蝕印術了，蝕印的結果，就能成各種有花紋的布，這裏有兩種錫鹽蝕印劑的配合法如次：　　（甲）錫鹽白色蝕印劑</p>
<p>錫鹽丨二五○克，酸醋丨一二五克，酸性澱粉濃厚劑丨五五○克，醋酸鈉丨六○克，</p>
<p>水丨一五○克</p>
<p>（乙）錫鹽彩色蝕印劑</p>
<p>染料丨四○克，水丨一五○克，酸醋丨一二五克，酸性澱粉濃厚劑丨五五○克，錫鹽丨一六○克，檸檬酸丨三○克，醋酸鈉丨五○克，甘油丨三○克</p>
<p>用這兩種蝕印劑印完，必須蒸浴十五分至三十分鐘，取出洗凈，那末蝕印的手續完畢了，</p>
<p>另外還有一種氫氧化亞硫酸鹽蝕印劑，然在應用時，另須加鋅白少許，以維持蝕印處潔白的顔色，爲了鋅白不易和織物的纖維牢結，所以還得加些蛋白質，若是彩色的就不須要，且把這兩種蝕印劑的配合成分寫下：</p>
<p>（甲）氫氧化亞硫酸鹽白色蝕印劑</p>
<p>氫氧化亞硫酸鹽丨三五○克，水丨三○○克，工業橡皮丨八○克，鋅白丨三五○克，蛋白質丨一六○克，松節油丨七克，</p>
<p>（乙）氫氧化亞硫酸鹽彩色蝕印劑</p>
<p>染料丨四○克，水丨三八○克，不列眞樹膠濃厚劑丨六五○克，氫氧化亞硫酸鹽丨一八○克，</p>
<p>用這蝕印劑印完，也要蒸浴五分至十分鐘，而後洗凈才可，</p>

<h3>早婚論爭的結尾</h3>
<p>阿彦</p>
<p>丨答文炳君丨</p>
<p>我深信對於事實的認識，是與其所持觀點的如何而有所不同的，所謂智者見智仁者見仁，即是此理，就是拿一般人對於中國問題的認識而言，也有許多絶對不同的看法，有人以爲中國現在是封建的半封建的或封建勢力支配的社會，有人以爲中國現在是資本主義的社會，有的以爲中國現在是封建勢力最後掙扎資本主義逐漸抬頭的社會，這許多相異的論調，當然只有一個眞理，其他的不是觀察的方法不對，便是立論有了錯誤了，</p>
<p>我對於我自己也是這樣，我並不堅認我的觀察爲不移之理，我認爲眞理必要經過多數人的探討規納而成立的，所以我對於文炳君對我早婚觀察的批評，極端表示感謝，不過我以自我的觀點來分析結果，覺得對於文炳君的指示還有伸答的必要，</p>
<p>早婚現象是發生在倫理觀念比較濃厚的封建社會裏的，同時那時候也就是自給自足的農業社會，經濟組織單簡，謀生比較容易，這也就是當時早婚現象普遍發生的原因，</p>
<p>但是現在又怎樣，中國已在國際帝國主義的經濟侵略之下呻吟了將近百年了，中國現在的經濟形態已有了巨大的變化，所謂自給自足的農業社會，早巳成了歷史上的名詞，中國現在已由農業社會越過商業社會而奔向資本主義的社會去快了，謀生不但是不容易，大多數人都在無法生活，倫理觀念和禮敎思想，原是當時政治制度與經濟形態的反映，目前已脫去了封建的外衣而具備了資本主義經濟的雛型，舊的思想還不是在日漸銷滅嗎？我們還能說，在共匪紅軍所盤據的各省農村還有所謂倫理觀念嗎？那裏早就「世風日下，人心不古」了吧，今年江浙農民的搶米風潮，還不是那些舊思想的叛徒的勾當嗎？但是部份的事實當然難免的，不過我們應該把握全體，假使一個外國人到廣西去把猺民的生活視爲我們整個中華民族生活的代表，那他就是大錯特錯了，</p>
<p>據上述，由於早婚現象發生的原因已不存在，所以早婚問題已不能成爲問題了，假如文君要把部份的例外的早婚事實撤底消滅，那是比較容易的事，但也免是多事了，其實，即令文君堅認早婚問題的存在，那還不是婦女問題或整個社會問題的小枝節，</p>
<p>其次，文炳君說，「就是經濟好的人，早婚是對的嗎？未免失笑！」這顯然是文君的誤會，我早已聲明不提倡早婚，我没有說早婚是對的，有益的，我不過說早婚雖然有害，但並不是絶對的而是相對的，對某一種人給他早婚，反而可以補救他的病態，我没有主張用早婚來醫治靑年的手淫，决不會如此大膽而荒唐，</p>
<p>最後文炳問我說，「阿君還說，今後的兩性結合，儘可任其自然，……阿君此語，未知曾否經過思考！「這是不用思考的，我根本不主張用法律或其他不自然的方法來限制兩性的自由，兩性有共同需要，儘可自然結合，「十二三歲的男女結合「我也没有主張過，畜牲出世後也要經過相當時期才與異性交合，何况人類？假如文炳君恐怕提倡了兩性自然結合而發生十二三歲男女自由結合的事，那未免太過慮了，人類是永遠有長者的導引的，那怕在未來世界大同的社會裏，政治法律等制度一起廢除了以後，敎育還是繼續存在的，</p>
<p>文炳君獻給我的二語「事實是雄辯，看問題尤應着眼於大體」不但是我，誰都會虚心接受的，至關於這些論爭，我想就此告了結果，誰再有批評我的文字時恕我不再作答了，</p>

<h3>Han Fuqu's Troops Encircle Yexian</h3>
<p>A Portion Advances Eastward Beyond Yexian, Attacking Qixia</p>
<p>Liu Zhennian Cables the Executive Yuan, Stating Compliance with Orders to Withdraw Troops</p>
<p>He Yingqin and Others Confer on Methods to Eliminate Internal Warfare</p>
<p>(Jinan) Shahe telegram: Three representatives of the Yexian city populace arrived in Shahe at 21:00 on the 21st to meet with Han. According to them, Liu's troops within the city have begun looting, dismantling doors and windows of civilian houses, and sealing up the people's grain in the eastern moat, causing a complete lack of food. Morale among the troops is panicking, and a mutiny occurred last night. The autumn harvest grain is all outside the city, making it exceedingly difficult to hold out for long. They requested protection of the people's lives, avoidance of bombardment, and a swift resolution. Han stated that driving out Liu was to save the people and that he would absolutely not bombard the city unless absolutely necessary, so as not to cause a catastrophe. Our heavy troops and militias have already encircled Yexian, only four or five li from the city, but have not yet attacked. Zhen Liu Nian is currently inside Yexian city. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>A telegram from Jinan Shahe reports that at 15:00 on the 21st, a regiment of Liu's troops from Yexian suddenly emerged near the city. They were forced to retreat by provincial troops using heavy force. The provincial troops have reached the city's edge, and Li Hanzhang's brigade has also advanced from Pingdu to Shilipu, south of Yexian, forming an encirclement. Han is afraid of harming the civilians in the city and therefore has not bombarded it. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Local civilian self-defense forces are rising up everywhere, and Liu's troops are struggling to cope. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain representative said that Liu Shijiu is directing military affairs in Laiyang. A portion of Han's troops bypassed Yexian and are pressing towards Laiyang. A brigade of Liu's troops inside Yexian city once sent a representative to meet with Han, requesting to surrender. Han has agreed. When Liu's troops retreated, they destroyed the Yantai-Weixian highway with many deep trenches. Continuous heavy rains have slowed military progress slightly. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Cessation of hostilities: A portion of the provincial troops has advanced eastward beyond Yexian to attack Qixia. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Shaotang telegraphed Ping, reporting that the enemy at Yexian collapsed and retreated on the night of the 20th. All their weapons, ammunition, and supplies were seized by the local Shengxian Society and Red Spear Society. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) As the provincial troops advance, villagers bring soup and water to犒劳the troops, with basins and pots lined up along the way. Han is deeply moved. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) There seems to be gradual progress towards a compromise between Han and Liu. Yesterday, Liu Zhennian cabled the Ministry of Military Affairs, stating that he had complied with the central government's order to withdraw westward from Yexian. Another report states that He Yingqin, appointed by Chiang Kai-shek to mediate, has also telegraphed Han Fuqu, saying that he has ordered Liu Zhennian to relinquish the administrative power of Jiaodong and increase the military expenditure of Liu's troops. (Reuters Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Han Fuqu stated that his troops are still advancing and have already occupied many strategic locations. He will not cease fighting until Liu Zhennian is dismissed from his post. (Reuters Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) According to a communiqué from Han Fuqu's headquarters, the right wing of Liu's army in Laizhou has been repelled. A brigade of defeated soldiers was captured and disarmed by Han's troops during the retreat. The rest retreated towards Longkou, which is about 40 miles north of Laizhou. It is reported that the right wing of Liu's army is digging trenches and holding their ground in Qixia, 35 miles northwest of Yantai. Two Chinese merchant ships in Yantai are reportedly being detained, possibly so that Liu Zhennian can use them to escape in an emergency. (Reuters Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) According to a telegram from Weixian, Liu Zhennian's army feels that abandoning its existing territory is disadvantageous because the central government's mediation is becoming more effective. Therefore, its front-line troops have retreated to the second line of Huangshanguan, Zhaoyuan, and Laiyang, where they are reorganizing their ranks. The troops in the Muping Taiyang area have also been ordered to advance, launching a sudden offensive against Han's army. On Han's side, one of the main left-wing forces is stationed in Banma Village, Zhaoyuan, facing Liu's army across the river; one of the central forces is advancing eastward from Shuanghanshan Rizhuang; and one of the right-wing forces has occupied Gucheng, while Xize Jingshan is in the midst of battle. Reinforcements have been sent to all fronts, and a full-scale general offensive will begin tomorrow morning. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Jiang Bocheng Arrives in Jinan and Immediately Goes to Weixian</p>
<p>(Jinan) This morning, Jiang Bocheng arrived in Jinan from Beiping. Important figures all met him at the station. Jiang said that he had been ordered by the Commander-in-Chief to come to Jinan to meet with Han to mediate the Jiaodong incident. He hoped to temporarily halt military actions and discuss the aftermath at length. He knows that Han has always been upright and has always obeyed the Commander-in-Chief. This time, he was forced to act, and in the future, he will be able to obey the Commander-in-Chief's opinion and resolve this matter. Zhang in Beiping also advocated a speedy resolution, and Wang takes the Commander-in-Chief's opinion as his own. The central government will decide on how to resolve this in the future.

<p>The Conference in He Yingqin's Residence</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yaozu, Zhu Peide, and others are in He Yingqin's residence today, discussing ways to eliminate the Lu war. Liu Zhennian's representatives, Yang Lichuan and Han Dong, also came in person to report on the tense situation in Jiaodong.

They decided to promote further measures, telegraphing both sides and leaders in North China to make a concerted effort to find a way to eliminate the conflict.

Han Dong felt that his mission had been completed and was scheduled to go west to meet with Chiang on the morning of the 23rd to report everything. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Liu Zhennian's Chief of Staff Arrives in Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian's Chief of Staff, Han Dong, arrived in Nanjing from Yantai, requesting instructions. In the afternoon, he met with He Yingqin to report everything. According to Han Dong, Chairman Han Fuqu mobilized two brigades to Weixian on the 14th under the pretext of troop rotation, which our division did not pay attention to. After Han's troops, Cao Fulin's division, arrived in Weixian on the 15th, the communication to Yantai was immediately cut off. Cao also requisitioned thousands of carts and a large amount of grain and fodder in Weixian Changyi. Cao Fulin's division, Qiao Lizhi's division, Gu Liangmin's division, and Zhan Shutang's division, divided into two routes, advanced towards our division's defense area. At the same time, Chairman Han personally led his pistol brigade to Weixian to direct the battle. It is truly unexpected that this unfortunate incident occurred on the day when the Northeast was lost and the whole country was in mourning. After receiving the report, Liu Zhennian immediately ordered the troops stationed in the Shahe, Changyi, and Pingdu areas to retreat on the 17th to avoid conflict, and telegraphed Chairman Han twice, requesting peace, but received no reply. At the same time, he asked the central government for instructions. Soon, Chairman Chiang and Minister He both telegraphed to retreat to avoid escalating the situation. Now, Liu is listening to the central government's handling of the matter in order to seek a peaceful solution. The front-line troops of our division have been ordered to retreat and are not allowed to fire a single shot at Han's troops. If Han's army does not advance further, then peace is not yet hopeless. As for the various excuses announced by Han about our division, we will not argue. We only ask the central government to understand, and public opinion to judge; right and wrong will not escape public opinion. He Yingqin received a telegram from Han Fuqu from Shahe on the 22nd. Since Shahe is 50 li from Yexian, Han's army has advanced again. He personally feels the need to go to Wuhan to report to Chairman Chiang. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian telegraphed Nanjing on the 21st, stating that Han Fuqu's heavy troops attacked our division. In order to obey the telegram orders of Chairman Chiang and Minister He, Zhennian resolutely ordered the front-line troops to retreat. Unexpectedly, as we retreated, they advanced, pressing closer and closer. He fears that his subordinates will become agitated and, when they can no longer endure it, will come out to defend themselves. Zhennian will not bear any responsibility for the start of the war, and hopes that the elders and brothers of the whole country will understand and forgive him. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>The Navy Maintains Order in Longkou</p>
<p>There are currently no soldiers from Liu Zhennian in Longkou. Eighty marines from the Northeast Fleet and the security team are working together to maintain order. Because the armies of Han and Liu are not engaging in naval warfare, Longkou is relatively peaceful. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Yantai) The battlefront is now expanding towards Longkou and Laizhou, so the situation in those two places is becoming increasingly tense, and disturbances may occur. Fighting has been seen near Laizhou, so all foreigners in Laizhou have left the country. Customs patrol boats are now docked in Longkou, apparently at the request of the customs commissioner of that port. Two Chinese gunboats have sent troops ashore to help the Chamber of Commerce maintain order. The Liu army, which was stationed in Longkou, has now set off, and the chief of police has also left. It is now believed that he is following the army to the front line. The people of Longkou are feeling even more uneasy because of this. Han's army is still pressing forward, seemingly trying to encircle the left wing of Liu's army. (Reuters Dispatch, 21st)</p>

He told reporters that he had received a telegram from the Shanghai League to Abolish Civil War, instructing him to mediate the conflict between Han and Liu. He would first go to Jinan to find out the truth, and then go to Qingdao to try to meet with Han. In his opinion, if both sides believe they are suppressing bandits, then the troops should not open fire. If they believe they are suppressing rebels, then there should be a central government order to suppress them. Otherwise, it is a civil war. Now, the country is in grave danger, and the people are suffering. For the sake of the country and the people, they should rein in their horses and stop military actions. The aftermath should be handled by the central government. He represents the people and, with sincerity, appeals for a ceasefire. He believes that Chairman Han is very patriotic and will be able to stop at the right time. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

When ground order is restored and someone is responsible, they will hand over security and return to their ships.

<h3>New Ways to Resolve International Problems</h3>
<p>Reuters Telegraph, Geneva Disarmament Main Department. An open meeting was held today to discuss the attitude towards Germany. Chairman Henderson said, "The Disarmament Conference has reached a critical stage. Delegates should open a new path forward, but the decision on this new path is extremely important. It will either lead to peace or brew an arms race, and the result will be war. The distinction between peace and war depends on this one move." Henderson's words are indeed pertinent. However, considering today's situation, it is not only the disarmament problem that should open a new path. The Sino-Japanese problem in East Asia should also be resolved with a proper new path as soon as possible, otherwise, it will fall into the danger of destroying peace and causing war. The matter is essentially the same and also interconnected.</p>
<p>Let us first discuss the disarmament problem. Henderson believes that Germany's demand for arms equality is of great importance. If everyone still harbors selfish intentions and uses perfunctory tactics, there will inevitably be a danger of a breakdown. Therefore, a new path must be opened. His proposal is indeed insightful, but I believe that the first thing to do in order to find a new path is to eliminate the phenomenon of international contradictions. Since the great powers initiated disarmament, contradictions have been discovered everywhere. None of the important disarmament proposals put forward by various countries are not tools for defending themselves and guarding against others. Since disarmament is not sincere, it is naturally difficult to avoid contradictions. The British government has always claimed to be consistent with the United States on disarmament. Does it still express sympathy with the United States or with France? Germany once expressed sympathy with the US government's proposal to reduce by one-third. Does the United States also sympathize with Germany's demand for equality, or does it sympathize with France? Today, the key to the problem lies entirely with Britain and the United States, with Britain being at the center of the overall situation. Only when Britain's position is determined, the consistent position of Britain and the United States is determined, words and actions are not contradictory, and appearances and realities are not contradictory, can there be a so-called new path. The so-called new path is nothing more than enabling the great powers to reach a consensus with Germany, giving Germany the opportunity to automatically cancel its proposal to not attend. To get Germany to cancel its proposal to not attend, the powerful countries that oppose Germany's proposal must first realize the danger of stubbornly resisting and have the determination to pull back from the brink. Today, the only country that does not express sympathy with Germany is France. If Britain and the United States can use a consistent position to mediate between Germany and France, Germany will definitely ease its attitude, and France will also make considerable concessions. Therefore, the position of Britain and the United States does have the ability to influence the situation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the consistent ability of Britain and the United States is not only enough to open a new path in Europe, but also enough to open a new path in East Asia. The only country that Japan is trying its best to enlist as its ally today is France. If Britain and the United States can act in concert with France, Japan, no matter how strong, will inevitably have some concerns and will not dare to act recklessly. According to today's Reuters report from London, the French government has changed its Far East policy towards China and Japan and will abandon its behind-the-scenes support for Japan's actions and adhere to the League of Nations Charter. The responsible spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry also stated that he has never changed Briand's policy of upholding the dignity of the League of Nations. If this is the case, France has no intention of cooperating with Britain and the United States to deal with the East Asian problem. If Britain and the United States make a fair and reasonable proposal to France, it will not be difficult to find a new path to solve the East Asian problem. However, if the United States expresses to France that it still wants to exchange the German arms issue for the Far East issue with Japan, then there will be more twists and turns in the international community in the future.</p>

<p>Incident of Two British People Abducted in Niuzhuang</p>
<p>Wang Dezhong (transliteration), the Chinese who contacted the bandits in Niuzhuang, is now keeping his movements strictly secret. There is no new development in the negotiations, but the Japanese military authorities have agreed not to take any action to suppress the bandits until the two abducted people are released, which greatly facilitates the rescue. A British newspaper is willing to offer a reward of 10,000 pounds to rescue the two people. The authorities are now trying to prevent this news from reaching the bandits, but they fear that the bandits will eventually find out. (Reuters telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Today in Niuzhuang, a groom employed by Dr. Phillips, the father of Mrs. Bowes-Lyon, brought letters written by Mrs. Bowes-Lyon and Kirkland, along with a letter from the bandits, which stated various ridiculous conditions for release. Both Bowes-Lyon and Kirkland asked for a speedy rescue, otherwise, their lives would be in danger. However, the bandits will first cut off their ears and send them to Niuzhuang as a warning. They also said that the bandits are treating them well, but their living conditions are very uncomfortable and they are eager to take a bath. It is reported that the "Manchukuo government" telegraphed the London Daily Express, saying that the authorities had warned foreigners not to go to the suburbs of Niuzhuang before Mrs. Bowes-Lyon and Kirkland were kidnapped, but foreigners here firmly claim that they did not receive such a formal or informal warning. (Reuters telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The situation of the two British people abducted in Niuzhuang is still a matter of concern to the political circles here, but according to Reuters, British officials are now aware that both the Japanese and Manchu authorities are doing their best to assist in facilitating the work of British personnel in rescuing the abductees. (Reuters telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, a telegram from Shenyang stated that although the authorities are making every effort to investigate the whereabouts of the two abducted British people, they are still unable to determine their location because the bandits are constantly moving. According to information obtained by the "Manchukuo" authorities, the bandits must move the spring general machine every night. Since September 16, they have been moving several times a day to prevent being detected. (Reuters telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>France Changes Far East Policy</h3>
<p>Will Abandon Pro-Japanese Attitude and Support the League of Nations Covenant</p>
<p>The U.S. Willing to Help France Reject German Arms Demands</p>
<p>As an Exchange for Helping the U.S. Oppress Japan</p>
<p>If the Investigation Report is Unfavorable to Japan</p>
<p>The Japanese Claim They Have Decided to Withdraw from the League of Nations</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 22nd -- A dispatch from Geneva this morning reports that the French government has changed its Far East policy towards China and Japan. It will abandon its behind-the-scenes support for Japan's actions and adhere to the League of Nations Covenant. This is because France now advocates strict application of the League of Nations Covenant on the issue of German armament. The National News Agency, Washington, 21st -- It is learned that the U.S. government is now quietly probing the opinions of major European governments regarding recent events in Manchuria. It is said that the U.S. Far East policy has not fundamentally changed, but the degree of its opposition to Japan will largely depend on the extent to which the League of Nations, especially Britain and France, uphold existing treaties.</p>
<p>Reuter, Paris, 22nd -- A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated to a Reuter reporter this morning regarding rumors that France will change its policies toward the Far East and the League of Nations, making a responsible statement that France adheres to Briand's declaration on the three eastern provinces and has never considered recognizing "Manchukuo." France is awaiting the Lytton Report and will abide by the League of Nations' resolutions. Therefore, there is no question of a change in France's Far East policy, as France's current stance is still the same as that announced by Briand last autumn. The spokesperson also stated two points: First, France has always supported the League of Nations' resolutions regarding treaty rights in the Far East. Second, France has never disagreed with the U.S. regarding the three eastern provinces. Therefore, there is no question of France leaning towards the U.S. at present. Briand's policy announced a year ago aimed at a peaceful resolution of the Manchurian issue. Today, the spokesperson referred to Briand's remarks at the League of Nations Council meeting on November 16th last year and when the League of Nations decided to send an investigation team, saying that although Briand has passed away, France will still obey the League of Nations and uphold the dignity of international obligations. The spokesperson repeatedly stated that France's policy has always been consistent, and rumors of a change in policy are purely absurd.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd -- According to reliable sources, U.S. Senator Reed proposed to the French Premier that the U.S. would consider France's position on the war debt issue, and France is also expected to maintain the U.S. position on the China-Japan issue. This is the expression of U.S. Secretary of State Stimson's non-recognition doctrine after Japan recognized the puppet state of Manchukuo. The U.S. State Department's attitude is to reverse the negative domestic and international criticism and use it for the presidential election. U.S. President Hoover intends to induce France to lead the League of Nations and oppress Japan. The French Premier is considering his attitude towards Japan and the U.S. regarding this proposal, which is very important before the payment of war debts to the U.S. this autumn. Recently, the French Foreign Ministry's official newspaper "Le Temps" has gradually revealed an anti-Japanese attitude, so France's attitude is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Reuter, New York, 21st -- The acting Japanese Ambassador to Washington, Saito, declared here today that if the nature of the Lytton Report forces Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations, Japan will not hesitate for a minute to withdraw. If the Lytton Commission understands the truth, Japan has nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Lytton Report Delivered to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Reuter, Geneva, 22nd -- The Lytton Commission's report was delivered to the League of Nations office today. The report is about 400 pages long, typed, and the English version is complete. Although much of the French version has been translated, it still needs time and revision to be completed. Efforts are now being made to expedite printing and distribution to members of the League of Nations. French Commissioner General Claudel and German Commissioner Dr. Schnee have arrived in Europe. The remaining commissioners, including Lord Lytton, will arrive in Venice on September 30th.</p>
<p>Japan-Manchukuo Agreement Suspension of Registration</p>
<p>Due to the Deteriorating International Atmosphere</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd -- The attitude of the Japanese Foreign Ministry has now been confirmed that the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol will be temporarily suspended from formal registration with the League of Nations Secretariat.</p>
<p>China Alliance News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd -- The Japanese Foreign Ministry originally planned to send the "Japan-Manchukuo Treaty" and "Protocol" to the League of Nations Secretariat for registration. Recently, due to the gradual rise of countries advocating the maintenance of justice and Japan's intimidation, the Japanese Foreign Ministry is still hesitating whether to send it or not. In the end, the strategy can only be decided after waiting for the League of Nations meeting.</p>
<p>Recognition of the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Presents Conditions</p>
<p>Abolish War and Propaganda of Redification</p>
<p>Japan Decided It Is Difficult to Accept</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, after the Japanese government recognized the puppet state of Manchukuo, the next to do so may be Russia, but Russia has put forward conditions for recognizing Manchukuo. The Japanese government has rejected consultations due to the harshness of the conditions, so it has fallen into a state of stagnation. Foreign Minister Uchida believes that Russia, as a neighboring country bordering Manchuria, has a great relationship with Manchuria, and has repeatedly urged Russia to recognize Manchuria. The Russian government took advantage of Uchida's implied opportunity and used the non-aggression treaty proposed during the Inukai era as a condition for recognition. However, the non-aggression treaty proposed by Russia includes provisions for the abolition of war, which is completely contrary to Japan's national policy of state, and Russia requires Japan not to prohibit the Comintern's propaganda of redification against Japan and Manchukuo. Therefore, the government authorities have no room for consideration to persuade Russia to recognize Manchuria.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd -- Manchukuo Deputy Foreign Minister Ohashi Tadashi's trip to Harbin is said to be related to the Middle East Railway issue, as fundamental differences have arisen between Russia and Manchukuo. However, according to another source, the opportunity for the Soviet Union to recognize Manchukuo is ripe, and the negotiations with the Russian Consul General will focus on the basic items that will arise with recognition, such as (1) how to deal with the Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian agreements with the Middle East Railway as the main body, and (2) the issue of establishing a non-aggression treaty between Russia and Manchukuo.</p>
<p>Puppet Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Publishes Absurd Statement</p>
<p>Limits the Powers to Recognize the Puppet Organization Within Six Months</p>
<p>But Japanese Officials Suddenly Deny This News</p>
<p>Reuter, Tokyo, 22nd -- According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun's Changchun dispatch, the puppet Foreign Minister Xie Jieshi stated today that the government will soon ask the Powers to recognize Manchukuo, with a deadline of six months. If any country does not recognize "Manchukuo" or does not start recognition negotiations with "Manchukuo" within this period, then "Manchukuo" will not recognize the country's rights and interests in Manchuria and regard it as a non-treaty country.</p>
<p>Reuter, Tokyo, 22nd -- A dispatch from Changchun says that the news reported by the Changchun correspondent of the Asahi Shimbun is unfounded. However, it is heard that the "Manchukuo" government is currently drafting a commercial treaty and hopes to negotiate with the Powers. It also intends to implement a large-scale bandit suppression plan in winter to allow foreigners to live and work in peace and gain the trust of the Powers.</p>
<p>Japanese Communist Party</p>
<p>Plans to Redify the Air Force</p>
<p>Subsidizes Aviation School Expenses in Various Places</p>
<p>The Plan Was Discovered and Rounded Up</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd -- Some extremist elements of the Communist Party, targeting factories, have begun intense activities, planning to use airplanes on the 20th to carry out air redification. Due to the secrecy failure, it was discovered by the authorities. The Metropolitan Police Department arrested the central figures of the Military Commission of the Japanese Communist Party the day before yesterday: Kashima Mutsujiro (29 years old), a lecturer at Yokohama Vocational School who graduated from a commercial university; Ueda Mitsuo (37), the principal of洲崎 Aviation School; Endo Tadashi (29), a graduate of Tokyo University; Azumogumo Ken-no-suke (27), a student of the Aviation School; and his mistress, etc., all rounded up. Kashima had lent 3,000 to the struggling aviation school on the condition of training communist aviators, intending to train leftist aviators and obtain party members.</p>
<p>Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Has Reached a Critical Juncture</p>
<p>Must Find a New Path to Move Forward</p>
<p>The World's Peace or War Depends on This Move</p>
<p>Chairman Henderson's Opening Remarks</p>
<p>Reuter, Geneva, 21st -- Due to Chairman Henderson's repeated proposals, the main body of the Disarmament Conference held a public meeting today. This is an innovation. Although Germany's attitude is currently the biggest problem, it has not been discussed yet, as Henderson believes that the main body should give Germany the opportunity to respond to its letter of September 18th and should not immediately discuss its absence. Henderson stated at the opening of the meeting that the Disarmament Conference has now reached a critical stage, and representatives should find a new path to move forward. However, it must be known that the decision of this new path is extremely important and will either lead to peace or create an arms race. The result of the arms race is only war, so the future of peace or war depends on this move. French Premier Herriot came here from Paris, originally intending to attend the meeting to participate in the discussion of Germany's attitude. Now that this matter has been postponed, he did not attend and will return to Paris today. He can return to Geneva on Sunday to attend the League of Nations General Assembly. The meeting of the main body of the Disarmament Conference discussed the degree of work based on the cases passed on July 23rd in the afternoon. Those passed on July 23rd were: (1) welcoming President Hoover's proposal to reduce armaments by one-third, (2) agreeing to prohibit attacks from the sky and chemical, bacterial, and incendiary warfare, (3) advocating restrictions on the caliber of land artillery and the weight of tanks, (4) advocating the establishment of a permanent armaments committee, and (5) requesting the signatory countries of the Washington and London naval treaties to consult on further reducing naval armaments. Russian representative Litvinov insisted on discussing the issue of immediate disarmament based on the proposals of Russia or the U.S., but the meeting finally adopted the method of reviewers' recommendations. The main body adjourned the meeting until 7 pm and scheduled to reconvene at 11 am tomorrow. The Secretary-General will draft a document to indicate the progress of the Chemical Warfare Committee's discussions.</p>
<p>Herriot</p>
<p>Coming and Going Hastily Arouses Suspicion</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 21st -- French Premier Herriot arrived in Geneva this morning and set off for Lyon again tonight. Coming and going hastily arouses suspicion from the outside world. According to British sources, the French Premier came only to advocate investigating the so-called German secret armaments. Because there was no consensus on this issue in the British cabinet, he returned disappointed. It is also heard that when reporters asked Herriot about the purpose of his visit before his departure, Herriot replied with a resentful attitude that he came to Geneva because he wanted to see if anything was happening. Now that he sees nothing is happening, he is leaving. According to Herriot's words, it can also be regarded as indirectly acknowledging the rumor that the French Premier had a long talk with the German Foreign Minister, but the Germans refused to give up the issue of equality of armaments.</p>
<p>German Government</p>
<p>Insists on Equal Armament Demands</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 21st -- The German government's determination not to budge on the issue of equal armaments can be seen in an article by Foreign Minister Neurath published in today's "Freiheit" newspaper. Neurath declared in the conclusion that there is no doubt about our determination to insist on equal demands. He also said that disarmament negotiations have fallen into a complete stalemate because the powerful armed countries are unwilling to implement the disarmament guarantees stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations Covenant. Germany has patiently advocated in Geneva imitating Germany's general disarmament and demanding the application of the principle of equality, which means that if the disarmament convention does not meet the standards set by the Treaty of Versailles, Germany must be allowed the right to equal armaments. Denying this fundamental right is to divide countries into two classes, superior and inferior. Finally, he said that Germany's acceptance of the disarmament provisions of the Treaty of Versailles was only because it was a temporary solution that would be replaced by general international disarmament.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 21st -- Although the German government's decision not to participate in the Disarmament Conference has not changed, after the British ultimatum and Hoover's declaration, the German government deeply knows that the various diplomatic negotiations are closely related to Germany's plan to reorganize the army. It is difficult for Germany to avoid participation. According to reliable sources, the German government's intention seems to be to still insist on its demand for equality of armaments on the surface, but the countries that signed the Treaty of Versailles, if they can agree to include clauses in the final disarmament convention to replace Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, then Germany can be considered satisfied. If the countries guarantee Germany that they can do so, then the German representative can immediately attend the Geneva Conference again. As for the clauses proposed to be included in the convention, they still contain Germany's demands, which are roughly as follows: (1) Reduce the term of military service to six years. (2) Armaments that Germany is currently prohibited from setting up, such as artillery, airplanes, tanks, submarines, etc., will be abolished within a certain period. The time limit may be slightly longer, but it must be clearly stipulated. (3) Replace cavalry with motorcycle teams, etc. According to the German army's finances are already very affluent, even with this change, it will not increase the finances. From this demand, it can be seen that the main purpose of Schleicher's repeated shocking declarations is not the issue of disarmament, but the expansion of Germany's military strength.</p>
<p>Russian Representative</p>
<p>Litvinov Sympathetic to Germany</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 21st -- After the meeting of the main committee of the Disarmament Conference this afternoon, Russian representative Litvinov expressed deep regret for Germany's absence. Pointing to the empty seat of the German representative, he said, "This empty seat is really sad." He also said that the main committee can pass a resolution supporting the fairness of the German demand for equality in order to open the way for Germany to return to the meeting. According to this, because Chairman Henderson was unwilling to discuss this matter before Germany responded to his letter of the 18th, only Litvinov has made a few remarks so far. After Litvinov finished his speech, the committee proceeded to discuss the agenda, the most important of which was to have a specialized committee review the U.S. President's disarmament plan, followed by two cases: regulating the maximum strength of artillery and tanks, and whether the naval countries are willing to prepare reports on further reducing tonnage.</p>
<p>The Main Committee Continued to Meet Yesterday</p>
<p>Discussing the Supervision of Armaments Issue</p>
<p>Reuter, Geneva, 22nd -- The main body of the Disarmament Conference reconvened at 11 am this morning to discuss everything, chaired by Henderson. Speakers this morning focused on the issue of supervising armaments. The main body has sent a Belgian representative to draft a report on this matter. Russian representative Litvinov denied that the Soviet Union opposed the issue of supervision, saying that the Soviet Union not only did not oppose it, but was willing to conduct strict supervision and allow representatives of the Federation of Trade Unions and public organizations to assist in the supervision. The Soviet government is even more willing to supervise the armaments committee and not allow military authorities to join.</p>
<p>German Army Autumn Maneuvers</p>
<p>Red Army and Blue Army Confront Each Other to the Fullest Extent of Warfare</p>
<p>The President Personally Inspects and the People Rejoice</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 21st -- After President Hindenburg arrived at the front line, the German army autumn maneuvers entered a decisive battle. The hypothetical enemy, the Red Army, not only maintained its original position, but also had an advantage over the Blue Army, which was guarding the Oder River line and shielding Berlin. Starting yesterday, the Red Army transported its troops to the left bank of the Oder River, and the motorcycle reconnaissance team used pontoon bridges to cross the lower reaches of Fürstenberg and continue north, intending to join forces with the Red Army cavalry in that area. This cavalry also crossed the river at night and headed north of Fürstenberg. The Red Army General Staff's plan seemed to be to attack the enemy's flanks unexpectedly and cut off all contact between the enemy and the rear. However, the Blue Army was already prepared. Several large Blue Army infantry units were transported south at night, so it is not certain that the attacking troops themselves were attacked due to the complete change of the front line. To make the meaning of this maneuver thoroughly clear to the readers, we must also explain that the Red Army was able to drive straight in entirely because the strength of the army's motorcycle team was far superior to that of the Blue Army. Local residents were very interested in this maneuver and expressed warm welcome to the participating troops. The "Berliner Mittagspost" reported, "When the troops passed by, young girls threw flowers, and all the people were overjoyed by the arrival of the Federal President. This kind of spectacular and moving scene is not easy to come by."</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 21st -- When President Hindenburg left a village in Fürstenberg to watch the army maneuvers, a woman who worshiped the President threw a large bouquet of flowers at Hindenburg, hitting the President's head. The police have prohibited this kind of overly enthusiastic expression. Also, the situation of the army maneuvers has changed. The Blue Army staff, fearing being restrained by the Red Army cavalry, took the initiative to attack the Red Army cavalry with its cavalry. Today's maneuvers have proved that the machine gun team's movements are agile, and the new gas masks carried by the cavalry have good results. Also, when the light artillery team fired rapidly, the angle of its firing line was close to ninety degrees.</p>
<p>Within Thirty Hours</p>
<p>Gandhi Has Not Eaten a Grain of Food</p>
<p>Only Drinks Honey Dissolved in Water</p>
<p>Negotiations Between Indians and the Untouchables Approaching</p>
<p>Reuter, Poona, 22nd -- Gandhi has not eaten for thirty hours, only water touches his lips. Those who visit him say that Gandhi looks hungry. For the convenience of receiving visitors, Gandhi has moved from the European part of the prison to a small inner room near the entrance. Gandhi sits on a canvas bed and receives guests without moving easily. However, the daily routine of spinning and prayer is still not abandoned. Now, those who plan to save the situation all know that the matter is urgent. According to the acting chairman of the Indian National Congress, Gandhi's hunger strike may last for 25 days, but if he starves for ten days, he may never recover.</p>
<p>Havas, Bombay, 21st -- During Gandhi's hunger strike, he will use honey dissolved in hot water as a drink. Before the hunger strike, Gandhi published a declaration explaining the reasons for his decision to go on hunger strike. In the book, Gandhi expressed his hope that he could last for many days, so that his appeal could reach the ears of heaven, to promote the enlightenment of Britain, and to make the Indian people wake up. If the Indians are unwilling to treat the Untouchables with absolute equality, he will still starve to death. Gandhi requested in the declaration to hold a public demonstration movement throughout the country in order to seek an alliance with the Bariya clan among the Untouchables. Negotiations between the Indians and the Untouchables are still quite close, and there is hope for a compromise. The attitude of Dr. Ambedkar, the leader of the Bariya clan, has become more moderate. The Indian leaders' conference held here has just drafted a compromise plan to give the Untouchables ordinary voting rights and the right to be elected to special seats. The Bombay conference sent a delegation to meet Gandhi to submit the plan for his review.</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Yexian Telegram to All Newspaper Offices and National Elders and Brothers: Feeling deeply that since the Japanese invasion, the national crisis has become increasingly urgent, and the Red Bandits are spreading, the nation is in danger. All descendants of the Yellow Emperor will surely unite with sincerity and go to the national crisis together. How can we boil beans with beanstalks and promote the disaster of ruin? Zhennian is not talented but knows how to love the country. Therefore, since the September 18th Incident, he has supervised and trained his troops, cherishing the ambition of sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, and implementing defense measures, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Government. He originally hoped to relieve the national crisis as soon as possible and fulfill the duties of a soldier. This heart is bright, and the sun and the sky can see it. Unexpectedly, his wish was not fulfilled, and disaster struck suddenly. Han Fuju took advantage of the serious national crisis and secretly sent his troops to attack our division. Our troops have no grievances with Han's army, but they unexpectedly started a war for no reason. I don't know what Han's intentions are. For the sake of the country and the people, and to obey the telegram orders of Chairman Chiang and Minister He, Zhennian resolutely retreated the troops in front to show his concession. If Han is concerned about the national crisis and goes to the border with our division to resist the violent Japanese, it is also possible to hope for it. Unexpectedly, we retreated and they advanced, pressing harder and harder. But I am afraid that when the last subordinates are inspired to the point of being unbearable, they will come out for self-defense, then the responsibility of the people being devastated and being the head of the army, Zhennian will never bear a shred of it. This kind of last resort, I hope that the national elders and brothers will understand and forgive it, and I am very happy. I have laid out my words. Please understand and consider. Liu Zhennian, Commander of the 20th Division of the Army, and Deputy Commander He Yisan kowtow. Seal of Horse (Twenty-first day).</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of Zhu Jiqing's Departure to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Salvation Army Exceeds 150,000</p>
<p>General Offensive Launched on September 18th</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Zhu Jiqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast National Salvation Army, arrived in Tianjin in early August and made brief arrangements. On the 12th, he led the personnel of the nine departments of the Commander-in-Chief's office - Staff, Adjutant, Secretary, Manager, Military Law, Military Doctor, Political Affairs, Propaganda, and Transportation - as well as over fifty young people from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places who volunteered to join the army to the east of Tianjin. However, the Japanese paid unusual attention to Zhu, and bought traitors to try to assassinate him in Jinan, Tianjin, Pingquan, and Yuquan. Fortunately, Zhu had been working in the South for many years, and the people of the North only knew his name but did not recognize him. Even finding a photo of him was impossible, so he escaped the eyes of the traitors. As for Zhu's journey out of the Pass, he left Tianjin on the 12th, arrived at Liushouying on the 13th and disembarked. On the 14th, he traveled to Qian Shihe Village (in Funing County, Hebei Province). He carried a large quantity of firearms, ammunition, and medical supplies. On this land, where transportation was inconvenient, the power of mules and horses was indispensable. However, it was extremely difficult to hire a large number of mules and horses in the countryside because it was the autumn harvest season, and the danger beyond the Pass made many unwilling to go. Therefore, it was not until the 18th that the carts were hired, a total of twenty-four large carts, twenty mules, and two hundred and twenty donkeys. Each cart carried forty boxes of bullets, and each donkey carried four boxes. Mules were used to carry mortars and guns. However, this was only the first batch, and a large amount of military supplies was temporarily stored in a safe area in the rear for later transport in batches. To avoid the eyes of traitors and the reconnaissance of Japanese aircraft, they traveled at night and rested during the day. At 9 pm on the 18th, they departed from Qian Shihe. However, traveling at night on rugged roads with heavy carts was very difficult and slow. That night, they only traveled thirty li and rested at Zhaotouyingzi. The donkeys and mules were more agile, arriving at 12:30 am that night. The carts did not arrive until 7:20 am on the 19th. Local people said that the road ahead was even more dangerous, and the carters complained. So, thirty more donkeys and mules were hired to reduce the load on the carts. At 4 pm, they continued to travel. On the 20th, they arrived at Dushan County. On the 21st, they exited the Jieling Pass in the dim night. At this point, they were beyond the Pass. On the 23rd, they arrived at Qian Gou, in Lingyuan County, Rehe Province. They heard from locals that the Rehe authorities were preventing the National Salvation Army and volunteers from passing through the border. Because on August 2nd, the first group of seventeen working staff of Zhu's troops were detained for one day and night by Wang Yongwu, the establishment officer of the county, and then escorted out of the border. Therefore, this trip learned from the past and took considerable precautions. They immediately dispatched over five hundred troops under Shi Linge and over three hundred troops under Xing Jiukun to march in combat readiness, sending out advance guards and scouts on the left and right flanks to maintain strict vigilance to prevent accidents. On the 24th at dawn, they should have camped, but since there were no suitable villages, they wanted to speed up and reach Lama Temple to rest. Knowing there was danger, they had to risk moving forward. At 4:40 am, they arrived at Shijiazi. Suddenly, they heard a buzzing sound coming from afar. Everyone shouted a warning: "Quickly disperse and dodge the planes!" As they spoke, they quickly drove the donkeys and mules into the sorghum fields. At this time, four enemy planes attacked. The heavy carts were unable to dodge, and bombs rained down, about thirty or forty in total. After the bombing, they continued to strafe with machine guns, flying low and circling, less than a hundred feet from the ground. The faces of the Japanese on the planes were clearly visible. Zhu's troops scattered and lay in the sorghum fields, firing at the planes with rifles and submachine guns. As a result, one plane was wounded and fled in a panic. After the event, eight carts were found to be destroyed, carrying two packages of white cloth shirts, more than ten bolts of white cloth, and one or two dozen boxes of medical supplies (gifts from the National Disaster Relief Team). One carter was killed and two were injured. Fifteen mules and horses were killed, and one soldier was injured. But the ammunition and machinery were unharmed. However, in this uninhabited place, the vehicles were destroyed, and it was not easy to replenish them immediately. Therefore, the machinery and ammunition carried by the carts were temporarily stored in nearby farmers' homes, and over a hundred people were left to guard them. With arrangements made, the remaining staff ate a full battle meal and continued to move forward at 7 pm that night, marching quickly and silently. At 8 am on the 25th, they arrived at Heishan Town, a total of one hundred and twenty li, breaking the record for marching speed. The people of the town all offered food and drink to the volunteers, expressing their welcome, but fearing interference from the Rehe army and attacks from Japanese planes, they asked them not to stay long. Zhu's troops understood their suffering. Although they were tired, they advanced another twelve li and camped at Yangjia Township. This place was only forty li from the Liaoning Province border. Because they had to wait for the machinery and ammunition left at Shijiazi to arrive and compensate the hired carts and horses, and the carters and mules killed by the Japanese planes, and the destroyed vehicles, they were delayed for ten days. During these ten days, they were constantly in danger. To plan for safety, Commander-in-Chief Zhu urgently transferred two cavalry battalions and one infantry battalion from the Fourth Division and the Ninth Division to protect them. He also hired vehicles and horses and did not complete it until the 4th of this month. They continued to move forward at 12 o'clock that night and arrived at a certain place in the territory of Koukou County at dawn on the 6th, only fifty li from Koukou County in Liaoning Province. After Commander-in-Chief Zhu was stationed in Koukou, he convened a military conference of all the generals on the 10th and decided to launch a general offensive on the 18th. The plans for the general offensive, the coordination of each unit, and the replenishment of ammunition were all carefully stipulated. The main force of the attack on each route consisted of over 70,000 people, the reserve force in the rear had 45,000 people, and there were also over 20,000 volunteers led by a certain person, willing to accept command, and expected to arrive before the 15th. At the present time, the National Salvation Army under Zhu's command in western Liaoning has reached 150,000, and it is believed that within a month, it will reach over 200,000.</p>
<p>From Tianjin to the destination, they walked more than seven hundred li, climbed mountains and crossed ridges, and worked day and night. Many of the staff had swollen and painful feet. Each person received only one silver dollar a day for food, and had two meals of sorghum rice and millet porridge, accompanied by green onions and yellow soybean paste. If they could get an egg, it was a delicacy more precious than delicacies. Zhu shared the hardships with his subordinates, and his living and eating were no different from theirs, but his workload was twice that of others. The young people from Beijing and Shanghai who came to join the army were also able to endure hardships and dangers, and the soldiers of each route were active in spirit, even on the thorny journey, and were willing to sacrifice for the country.

<h3>National Army Captures Jinjiazhai</h3>
<p>Bandit Lairs on the Borders of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Have All Been Recovered</p>
<p>Remnants of Bandits in Honghu and Longgang Are Being Suppressed</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The bandits who gather in Hubei Province and on the borders of Henan and Anhui can be roughly divided into three groups. One is the fake Fourth Front Army, the Xu Jishen faction, based in Shangcheng, Guangshan, Jinjiazhai, Mabu, Bopi River, Xinji, Qiliping, Huang'an, Hekou, Changxuanling, Luotian, and Yingshan, occupying the largest area and with the most abundant strength. One is the fake Twenty-Sixth Army, the He Long faction, based in Diaowen Lake, Honghu, Qianjiang, and the north bank of Xiang River, harassing Jingmen, Tianmen, Mianyang, and Jianli counties. One is the fake Sixteenth Army, the Kong Hechong faction, based in Yinzhu, Liuren, Tongcheng, Sanxikou, Longgang, and Yanxia, with slightly weaker strength. The three groups stand on equal footing and have long been a scourge for the people. After Chairman Chiang arrived in Hankou, he immediately commanded the troops to suppress them in three routes. The middle route was aimed at the border of Henan and Hubei, Shangcheng, Guangshan, Xinji, Qiliping, and Huang'an, the left route was aimed at central Hubei to confront the He bandits, and the right route was aimed at western Anhui to confront the Yu bandits. After three months, all the important towns were recovered. The only remaining strongholds were Jinjiazhai, Honghu, and Longgang. The right-wing troops of the National Army have been advancing on Jinjiazhai, and Wei Lihuang's troops captured Yangjiahui, an important gateway to the village, on the 18th, and then led Li Moan's Tenth Division and Jiang Fusheng's Eighty-third Division to follow closely and fiercely attack. The main force of the Red bandits resisted at every step along the way, but were all defeated and forced to Jinjiazhai's old nest. After a fierce battle, they broke into the bandit's fort. The bandits could not hold on and fled to Mabu. Wei's army completely occupied Jinjiazhai at 11:00 AM on the 20th. It is reported that over ten thousand bandits were killed in this battle, over six thousand guns were captured, five hundred bags of salt and hundreds of dan of white rice were seized, and military supplies such as knives and spears were piled up like mountains. There were also many abandoned wounded and sick bandit soldiers. Now that the bandits have lost their stronghold, the army is pursuing them to completely annihilate them. As for the central Hubei area, after He Long's surprise attack on Jingsha, he fled to Jingmen, then north to Nanzhang, with only two thousand bandit soldiers following him. He is currently being suppressed by various armies. As for Honghu, according to Zhang Zhenhan's telegram, the lake surface has been cleared and they are now advancing into the center of the lake. Xu Yuanquan has advanced to Xindi to supervise the battle. There are now less than a thousand bandits in the lake, scattered and fleeing, seemingly aiming for western Hunan. However, they have been surrounded on all sides and it will be difficult to break through. In southern Hubei, after Guo Rudong's troops recovered Sanxikou, the Kong bandits collapsed in two groups, one fleeing to the border of Liuyang and Wanzai, where they are being surrounded by the Hunan army, and the other fleeing to Longgang's old nest, holding on for dear life. Guo's division departed from Sanxikou on the 18th, with one regiment attacking Yangjia Ancestral Hall in a guerrilla style, and dividing troops into two routes, one attacking Xinjie and the other attacking Lexiangyi, defeating the bandits. Guo's troops stopped at Sunjia Rock. They are now launching a fierce attack on Longgang. In summary, the lairs of the bandits in all areas, including Kuang Jixun's faction, have been lost, He Long is on the run, and Kong Hechong's faction is trapped in southern Hubei. It is expected that the time for suppression is not far away. (September 21st)</p>
<h3>Chiang Leaves Hankou for a Short Rest in Lushan</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang has been stationed in Hankou for three months. The bandit areas in the three provinces have been gradually suppressed under his supervision. Chiang wanted to take advantage of the situation to take a short rest in Lushan, so at 10:00 PM on the 21st, he and his wife, Soong Mei-ling, took the Xianning warship to Xunyang and then went to Lushan. He will stay for a few days and then return to Hankou to preside over military affairs. When Chiang was about to leave, Wang Shuhan, a member of the Peiping branch of the Military Affairs Commission, and Bao Wenyao, a representative of Zhang Xueliang, arrived in Hankou together to report on the recent military and political situation in North China and to ask for instructions. Chiang met with the two men and talked for a long time. When Wang and Bao set off from Peiping, the situation in eastern Shandong was urgent, and the conflict between Han and Liu had become a reality. Chiang had telegraphed Peiping, sending Military Affairs Commission member Chiang Bo-cheng to investigate and dissuade them. Wang and Bao's visit to Hankou may also have been to ask for instructions on this matter. As for Zhang Xueliang, who was previously reported to have come to Hankou to visit Chiang, it is now heard that he followed Chiang's instructions and stayed in Peiping to take charge of the situation, and has stopped his trip south. Wang will return to Peiping within a few days to report after meeting with Chiang. Bao will be stationed in Hankou on a regular basis, for consultation. Before meeting with Wang and Bao, Chiang first summoned the administrative supervisors of various regions in Hubei Province, Tang Ken, Liu Ji, Gu Renfa, and Cai Jilun, to give instructions on the policies for clearing the countryside and post-disaster reconstruction. He also stipulated that starting on the 22nd, the Party and Government Association would host a training course on local government affairs in Hubei at the Sui Mansion until the 28th. All regional administrative supervisors, secretaries of the supervisors' offices, deputy commanders of security, members, secretaries, and staff of the Party and Government Association, members of the provincial government, department heads, secretaries, responsible section chiefs, directors of security offices, chiefs of staff, secretaries, section chiefs, and other designated personnel must attend the lectures. The lecture subjects, times, and responsible personnel are all predetermined. On the 22nd, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, He Chengjun (who has left for Tianmen) and Xia Douyin will give instructions. From 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, there will be a lecture on party affairs, given by the Party Affairs Office.

<h3>Western Journey (25)</h3>
<p>Severe Erosion: As mentioned earlier, the important rivers of today, such as the Luo River and the Yan River, all originated after the deposition of the Sanmen series of red soil. In geological terms, this period is called the Qingshui Period. Its era is between loess and red soil. The Qingshui Period is about hundreds of thousands of years ago. Within this relatively short period, it has been able to create large-scale river valleys. It can be seen that the erosion in northern Shaanxi is severe. Furthermore, observing the scattered division of the plateaus everywhere and the dense distribution of deep valleys and valleys, the formation of a small valley often only requires a few hours of heavy rain. From this, it can be seen that the erosion is progressing rapidly. The surface strata of northern Shaanxi are mostly loose and weak, and the slopes are steep and the banks are high. Wind and rain are more likely to exert force, and the severity of erosion is natural. However, as a result, the plains are sunk, fertile fields are turned into wasteland, and the valleys are crisscrossed, blocking transportation. What is the impact of this on industrial development? Therefore, for the fundamental plan, we should find ways to limit this erosion to avoid the disappearance of fertile fields and the loss of soil. The most important methods to remedy this are afforestation and water management. This is well known.</p>
<p>Distribution of Minerals: Since the Jurassic period, northern Shaanxi has not been affected by orogenic movements, so the foundation is stable and the intrusion of volcanoes and igneous magmas has not occurred. Therefore, in theory, it is impossible to produce non-ferrous metal minerals such as gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin. The only important mineral known so far is oil and coal. Yanchang Shichi is famous throughout the country. It has been in operation for more than twenty years and has achieved good results. However, due to the constraints of transportation and the limitations of the economy, only small-scale mining can be carried out to meet the needs of the vicinity. It cannot be called a modern mining industry. However, the area of oil production in northern Shaanxi is not limited to Yanchang. Counties such as Yanchuan and Fushi also have abundant oil springs or oil seepage. At least it proves the existence of oil. If scientific methods can be used for detailed exploration, it may be possible to discover large oil fields. However, this work takes a long time and cannot be done in a hasty trip. As for coal mines, in addition to the Permian coal seams produced in Tongguan and Hancheng counties, the rest produced in the Jurassic are thin, of poor quality, discontinuous, and irregularly distributed. Except for small-scale indigenous mining, they may have no value.</p>
<p>Future Development: From the above observations, the path of future development in Shaanxi lies in animal husbandry and agriculture and forestry. The Shaanxi-North Basin is mostly made up of loess and red soil, so the soil is thick and fertile. Also, because the grasslands are vast, it is suitable for animal husbandry. The terrain is high and the rainfall is relatively abundant. In recent years, the counties in Guanzhong have often suffered from droughts, while the counties in northern Shaanxi have never been known to suffer from disasters. This is due to the fertile soil and abundant rainfall. However, due to the inconvenient transportation, sparse population, and excessive wasteland, it is an excellent opportunity for future agricultural development. When conducting investigations, it was witnessed that refugees migrating north from Fuping and Puyang counties were endless. Asking the county magistrates of each county, most of the people in northern Shaanxi are from other provinces and few are natives. It can be seen that northern Shaanxi can accommodate a large number of immigrants without being overpopulated. If the government can be reformed to protect the villages, reduce miscellaneous taxes, and let the people rest and recuperate, then in five years, northern Shaanxi will be a paradise in the Northwest.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Young Woman Commits Suicide by Drowning: Lu Shenfu from Shanghai runs a Fan brand towel factory in Shanghai. He has a daughter named Ziwen, who is twenty-one years old. She is married to Yuan Junli of Yuyuxiang, Suzhou. After the marriage, the family was not very harmonious. On the 19th of this month, Ziwen ran away in a fit of pique. Junli immediately ordered someone to inform Ziwen's maternal grandfather, who sent a letter to Lu Shenfu. Lu immediately came to Suzhou and advertised for her. Yesterday morning, he saw a news report that a woman's body in fashionable clothes was found in the river near Fengqiao. He rushed to inspect it and it was indeed his daughter. He reported it to the local court, which sent Prosecutor Liu to lead officials to inspect it. A suicide note was found, signed Ziwen. The letter was written in pencil and was so blurred that it was almost impossible to read. In addition, there were three one-yuan bills and three copper coins. Lu took back his daughter's shoes, ready to negotiate with Yuan Junli.</p>
<p>Final Judgment in the Huang-Lu Case: The protagonist of the long-pending master-servant love case, Lu Genrong, was declared innocent by the High Court in a retrial on June 30, 1911 of the Republic of China. The original prosecutor, Jin Henian, refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court. The appeal of the prosecutor has been rejected by the judge of the Criminal First Court of the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Orders the Establishment of a Bureau to Assist in Provincial Roads: The Provincial Construction Department has started work on the Shanghai-Nanjing Road in the province's Shanghai segment. However, it depends on the cooperation of various localities. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to the county's Construction Bureau, stating that the Shanghai-Wuxi section of the Shanghai-Nanjing Road should be surveyed as soon as possible in order to prepare a plan and estimate and prepare for construction. In addition to ordering the department's technician Zhang Jingcheng to go to the road for detailed survey and rapid reporting, the bureau was also urged to cooperate as much as possible, sending personnel to follow the survey to facilitate the progress. After receiving the telegram, Bureau Chief Qiu Xijue immediately sent personnel to Changshu to discuss everything with technician Zhang.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Rice Market is in Decline: Since the Shanghai War this year, the price of rice has been in decline. The autumn harvest this year has also been a bumper one. The Xin Jing, produced in the northern part of Wuxi, has been on the market for more than a month, but the supply is not very high. In the entire city, the daily arrival of Xin Jing is less than 500 shi, priced at around seven yuan and six jiao. However, the Xin Xian rice from Xinan has a substantial source, the supply is common, and the selling price is only slightly more than three yuan. The total amount of Chen Jing rice stored in the warehouses is still about 150,000 to 160,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Pirates from Da'an Port Flee Far Away: More than a thousand pirates gather in Da'an Port, which is on the border between Nantong and Hai'an. They are very rampant. The Nantong-Hai'an-Qidong Allied Defense District sent a guerrilla team on the 19th, together with soldiers from the 18th team of the 4th District of the Marine Police, to encircle and suppress the pirates by land and water. The pirates initially resisted stubbornly, but seeing that the government troops were strong enough, they set sail and fled. At this moment, there is no trace of pirates on the surface of the river in Da'an Port. On the 21st, the anti-piracy police team returned to its original defense.</p>
<p>Processing the Promotion and Transfer of the Tian Lu in the Abdomen: After the Nantong County Government was ordered to process the promotion and transfer of Tian Lu, it was ordered by the Finance Bureau to start with Liuhaisha along the river. After deliberation by the County Administrative Meeting, it was decided that the above method was unfair. It was agreed that the Tian Lu in the abdomen should be levied in accordance with the promotion and transfer tax rules. The Finance Bureau has received the above decision. However, it has not been determined from which year the levy should begin. Finance Bureau Chief Li presented a request to the county government for instructions on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Cases of Kidnapping and Robbery Occur Frequently in the Countryside: More than ten bandits suddenly came to Duxiang Village in the 10th District of the county last night. Each of them was armed with guns and went to the homes of farmers Liu Guozhi, Liu Guoan, and Yang Buhong to search for and rob. They also kidnapped Guozhi's daughter, Guoan's grandson, and Buhong's relative. In Ma Ruguo's home, a farmer in Maojia Village in the 9th District, eight bandits suddenly came at dusk the day before yesterday and kidnapped Ma and his young son together. Before leaving, they instructed the family to prepare money for ransom within ten days, otherwise they would set fire and kill them all, leaving no chickens or dogs alive. More than twenty bandits suddenly came to Danjiazhuang the day before yesterday and kidnapped one son and one daughter of Tao Shantain, one son of Yang Zhiyuan, and one son of Yang Zhixuan. They fired several shots before leaving and shouted and fled.</p>

<p>Wang Jingting Mediates the Land Tax Dispute: Recently, in the Second District, a dispute arose due to the land tax investigation. Villagers, in opposition to the investigation, gathered and caused trouble, destroying houses and injuring people. The next day, they blocked manure and vegetable carts from entering the city, and detained ferries, prohibiting traffic. On the morning of the 21st, around 5:00 AM, approximately 3,000 village women and men gathered on the opposite bank of the river. County police, public security chiefs, and police officers were also lined up outside the city, facing each other across the river. Public Security Bureau Chief Chen rushed to persuade them, but to no avail. He then telegraphed the County Chamber of Commerce, inviting Chairman Wang Jingting to go out from Fuyun Gate at 10:00 AM in the rain. At the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou bus station, he announced to the crowd that the previous day's misunderstanding was over, and that he had assured the authorities that the past would not be investigated. He also stated his intention to take responsibility for mediation. The crowd applauded and accepted, agreeing to send ten representatives to the city on the morning of the 22nd to discuss petition methods and plan for the aftermath at the Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>The Vibrant Sichuan University</h3>
<p>Efforts in Equipment and Hiring Professors</p>
<p>Establishing School Rules and Strict Examinations</p>
<p>Chengdu, September 6th Communication: Since Mr. Wang Hongshi took over as president of the National Sichuan University, he has been making every effort to eliminate existing malpractices and implement new policies. The initial efforts have been quite effective, and the school's reputation has been growing daily. Yesterday, while visiting a friend, I took the opportunity to visit the school. I received enthusiastic guidance from those in charge and a detailed account of the school's recent situation. Those who care about Sichuan University will surely be pleased to hear this. After taking over the school in May of this year, Mr. Wang and Mr. Liu actively reorganized it and devoted themselves to equipment procurement to increase students' study efficiency. They planned to establish school rules to guide students and hire professors to guide students academically. They strictly enforced examinations to avoid surprising students. Regarding equipment, it can be discussed in several aspects. First, the library and books. The school's original library had poor lighting and a narrow space, and the equipment was inadequate. The collection of books was uneven, and new publications were rarely seen, which was insufficient for students' research needs. Therefore, there were plans to build a library and increase the collection of new and old books. Regarding books, during the period when Zhang Chongmin was responsible for the reorganization, Provincial Chairman Mr. Liu Wenhui donated 30,000 yuan for purchasing books and 17,000 yuan for equipment. After Mr. Wang arrived at the school, he remitted the funds for purchasing books to Europe and America to purchase new and old books, which are already on their way. Secondly, the original Cungu Bookstore had been unable to continue due to financial difficulties several years ago and was temporarily managed by others. It has recently been taken back and is being managed by the school itself. Mr. Lin has been hired to oversee it. It is said that a decision has been made to collect and supplement the original printing plates and republish them, and to sell pre-orders to promote their circulation. The realization of this initiative will undoubtedly greatly benefit Sichuan's culture. As for building a library, it is a crucial plan for the school. However, due to financial constraints, it was impossible to start. Now, Provincial Chairman Liu has generously agreed to donate 300,000 yuan, with 100,000 yuan for construction and 200,000 yuan for books, to be allocated in installments starting from October of this year. The library will be located on the cliff of Meishan, and construction will begin soon. The second aspect is instruments. In the past, instruments were severely lacking, and a large-scale increase was necessary to meet the needs. In the previous period, 17,000 yuan of the previously saved instrument donation was used, and the school raised another 10,000 yuan to purchase various biological, physical, and chemical instruments from Germany. They have already been purchased and shipped to Tushan Zishui, and are expected to arrive in the province soon. The various instruments purchased in these two phases cost approximately 20,000 to 30,000 yuan for the university and approximately 3,000 yuan for the affiliated schools. It is planned to raise another 20,000 yuan for procurement in the near future. The various models required for plant specimens and the art department have also been ordered. Several hundred plaster models have been delivered. The third aspect is the construction of dormitories and classrooms. A new dormitory was built for the College of Education, and a large classroom was renovated in the Law School, which can accommodate 300 to 400 people for small-scale academic lectures. A biological laboratory was built in the College of Science for students to practice. The other colleges and affiliated schools have all been renovated, looking brand new. Compared to the previous dilapidated tiles, ruined walls, and overgrown weeds, it seems like another world. Regarding professors, more than 20 have been newly hired this semester. Those who have accepted the positions and are already in the province include Ye Bingcheng, Huo Libai, and Luo Qirong. Those who have accepted the positions and are on their way to the province include Xiang Zonglu, Meng Xianfu, Zhou Changshou, Chen Xiuren, Ding Zhaoshao, Zheng Yi, Huang Dazhong, Zhao Qinlian, Long Shourong, Cheng Liang, Zhao Shiping, Huang Fanggang, Xiong Mingqing, Tao Lengyue, and Wang Jian. It is expected that all of the above professors will arrive in the province around the start of the semester. In addition, the university office has established a publishing department to standardize the printing of lecture notes to save costs. It is also planned to publish a series of books and periodicals, such as weekly, monthly, and quarterly publications. A decision has been made to publish a weekly publication first. Regarding school rules, many have been successively formulated and announced, such as the provisional school regulations and the rules for discipline, classrooms, dormitories, meals, gatherings, and punishments, which are strictly enforced. Regarding examinations, whether for admission or academic year examinations, strictness is emphasized. This semester, dozens of students in each college have been held back due to failing grades. Furthermore, in this year's recruitment of new students, many initially registered to take the exam, but only 18 students were admitted as a result.</p>

<h3>Swiss and Austrian Olympic Committee Members Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Three Committee Members Arrived Here from Beijing Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Xie Jin Association Held a Banquet to Welcome Them Last Night</p>
<p>They Will Give a Speech at the YMCA This Afternoon</p>
<p>Mr. Masoli, a Swiss member of the Olympic World Games Committee, Mr. Schmidt, an Austrian member, and Dr. Li Ximo of Switzerland arrived in Shanghai from Beijing for sightseeing. They arrived in Shanghai at 8:05 AM yesterday morning by express train from Beijing. The Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, Laudi Zheng, Consul Tan Like, Secretary Qi Yamu, Wen Guofan, Qiu Naituo, President of the Swiss Association in Shanghai, the Austrian Consul in Shanghai, Ke Mo, as well as Chen Yuze, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, Jiang Zhiyong of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhang Feifan and Guo Lai of the Public Security Bureau, Zhong Zhiqi of the Health Bureau, Zhang Fuying of Shanghai Bank, Shen Siliang of the Sports Promotion Association, and dozens of others came to the station to welcome them. After the delegation got off the train, they went directly to the Huamao Hotel on the Bund to stay. Last night, the Sports Promotion Association held a banquet at the East Asia Restaurant to welcome them.</p>
<h3>The Banquet Held by the Sports Association Last Night</h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting's Welcome Speech: Tonight, we have the honor of having the Olympic Committee members from Switzerland and Austria visit our country after the 10th World Games in Los Angeles. I, on behalf of the Chinese National Sports Promotion Association, have prepared a simple meal to express our welcome. At the same time, we are also welcoming Mr. Shen Siliang, the honorary secretary of the Sports Promotion Association, who represented our country at the Games and has returned to Shanghai from the United States. I am deeply honored to have you all attend. The visit of the leaders of the sports circles of Switzerland and Austria is truly the supreme honor of our Chinese sports circles. Although our country only had one athlete and a small delegation attending this World Games, we were still able to stand on the international sports stage with the advanced powers and be treated equally. We are very grateful for the sympathy and support from people from all countries. I believe that Chinese sports are still in their infancy, and we have been self-enclosed for many years, so we have not been able to achieve good results in the international arena. However, in recent years, our country has gradually paid attention to the importance of sports, and the people have gradually become aware of the concept of internationalism, which is a gratifying new phenomenon. It is enough to make overseas people recognize the spirit of the emerging Chinese people. Everyone believes that the Olympic Games are the best opportunity to promote international friendship. Our country is located in the Far East and is lagging behind in everything. I hope that we will have more opportunities to contact European and American countries in the future, and use the spirit of sports and the morality of sports to work together to solve international difficulties and promote world peace. This is what I hope that the representatives of Switzerland and Austria will do their best to promote. Now, please all attendees stand up and raise their glasses to welcome them and wish them a safe journey.</p>
<p>Austrian Representative's Reply: After the closing of this World Games, my Swiss colleague and I visited the East to investigate the sports situation and to visit your country. We are honored by the warm welcome from all parties. Tonight, we are honored to be entertained by Dr. Wang and the directors of the Xie Jin Association, and to meet with Chinese and Western sports colleagues in Shanghai. It is a great honor. The Games were held in Los Angeles, which coincided with a difficult time for your country. At first, the members of the Games Committee were very worried that your country might not be able to send representatives to attend, which was a pity. However, when the opening ceremony parade took place, we not only saw a magnificent delegation participating, but also a Chinese youth athlete proudly holding the national emblem of the blue sky and white sun, marching in the parade ground with the representatives and athletes of all countries, which aroused the praise of people from all countries. This was one of the most pleasant things. I hope that Dr. Wang will work hard to promote it, so that when the Games are held in Berlin in 1936, many Chinese athletes will be sent to the meeting. I have been specially entrusted by the President of the International Sports Promotion Association to visit your country and encourage you to participate in the next Games in Berlin. I, on behalf of the Olympic Committee, have great expectations and a sincere welcome.</p>
<p>Shen Siliang's Report: I am honored to be invited by Chairman Dr. Wang to give a report. I would like to briefly state that this trip to the United States was to attend the grand World Games as a representative of Dr. Wang, the Olympic Committee member of our country, and to take the opportunity to visit and contact people from various countries to promote friendship. I am deeply honored. The details of this conference have already been seen in various newspapers. I am very grateful for the encouragement and publicity from the sports reporters of the major newspapers in Shanghai during this trip abroad. There is also half of what I can report, such as Mr. Tuo Ping, the secretary of the West YMCA in this city, who happened to be on leave and returned to the United States. He knew that I was coming to Los Angeles to help and worked hard. I would like to invite one of his representatives to thank him here. Finally, I feel that I have gained a very good impression and sympathy from people from all countries by attending this conference. However, sports in our country need to be promoted urgently. I hope that the Chinese and Western colleagues present will not hesitate to help and work together to promote it. This is what I hope.</p>
<p>Encouraging Our Country's Athletes: After the banquet, a commemorative photo was taken. Dr. Schmidt was asked by Shen Siliang, honorary secretary of the Xie Jin Association, to encourage the young people in the sports circles present. Dr. said briefly, I am very happy to meet with the young comrades of the Chinese sports circles tonight. For the convenience of everyone, I would like to offer a word in your language, I hope everyone will work hard to "progress."</p>
<h3>Zhao Jinqing Talks About Sports Diplomacy</h3>
<p>A Sports Ambassador is Better Than an Ordinary Diplomat</p>
<p>China Gained Nothing in Terms of Results This Time</p>
<p>But Gained Abundantly in International Status</p>
<p>After the banquet, a reporter asked Zhao Jinqing, a director of the Sports Promotion Association, about his thoughts and opinions on China's participation in the World Olympic Games this time. Mr. Zhao expressed extremely insightful views, which were both pertinent and alarming. The following is a record:</p>
<p>There are many conferences in the world, such as the Lausanne Conference, the Disarmament Conference, and the League of Nations Conference, which are too numerous to mention. However, they are all based on mutual deception, and it is difficult to seek world peace through them. Only the World Games is based on sincerity, a spirit of harmony, and the mutual exchange of skills, demonstrating the fighting spirit of each country. In this World Games that attracts global attention, no matter what country it is, as long as it can win a medal or a championship, its international status and honor will be greatly increased and respected by the world. Therefore, the success of a sports ambassador is often a hundred or a thousand times greater than what an ordinary diplomat can achieve. China's diplomacy has often failed today. However, if it can win a glorious position in sports diplomacy, China's international status and honor will surely rise by leaps and bounds. Mr. Wang Rutang is a diplomat, but he can pay attention to sports diplomacy. Therefore, he regards the promotion of sports as a great responsibility. In this World Games, although only one athlete from our country attended, the impression and significance on the international stage are extremely great. It shows that our China is one of the nations in the world. Gains and losses, victory and defeat, are not what we are concerned about. What it shows is the brave spirit of our Chinese nation to fight to the end, and to be one of the nations in the world. If we do not participate in this, the people of the world will not know where the Chinese nation is on the earth. Therefore, although we have not gained anything in terms of results, we have gained abundantly in international diplomacy. At the 9th Far Eastern Games, although there were only three athletes from India, their spirit was always persevering and not discouraged by failure. What they showed was the fighting spirit of the Indian nation. Therefore, in the current thorny situation of Chinese diplomacy, I deeply hope that the authorities will pay attention to sports diplomacy, which will surely be a great help in winning international status. As for the items to be held in Berlin in the next session, there will be a football item. Other items such as weightlifting and walking race, our country's Taijiquan China have the opportunity to participate in and perform, to promote the national spirit. I hope everyone will prepare in advance and the public opinion will also strive to promote it, to achieve its success.</p>

Youyou originally scheduled to play against Yiling team, and Widershee team temporarily played in place. Widershee team had special performances everywhere, but did not want to attack too much, purely for passing contact, in order to train, and to prepare for the Western football game. As a result, Widershee team only won Youyou by two to one. Youyou's winning goal was scored by Sun Huipei.</p>
<p>Huadong Defeated Yuequn Heavily Huadong's talents are quite average. Yesterday, the forwards had masterpieces every time. Yuequn was also a hero for a while, but under the exchange of spears, the difference was huge. In the first half, Huadong won a total of three goals, and in the second half, Huadong won four more goals. The total result was seven to zero. Huadong forwards Dong Xiaopei, Hu Youcheng, Ma Anquan, and Xi Qiaosheng were all extremely hardworking and good at fighting. Even the veteran Li Baojun can still maintain his old style. The defenders Tu Kaiyuan, Wu Gongliang, and Li Ning, as well as the goalkeeper Lu Zhongen, also dealt with it carefully and were impeccable. Now Huadong has won the two-team championship and will compete with a Lingnan army team for the championship.</p>

<h3>Seeking Justice</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>I searched high in the heavens and low in the earth, but nowhere could it be found.</p>
<p>Borrowing two lines from Bai Xiangshan's poem, it speaks of a weakling searching for justice; justice is the savior of the weak, and the weak seeking justice is like seeking a savior. Alas, searching high in the heavens and down into the depths, the savior of the weak could not be found.</p>
<p>Hearing that on the other side of the Pacific, there was a savior of the weak called justice, the weakling crossed the Pacific to seek out this Mr. Justice, imploring him to lend a helping hand. Mr. Justice simply nodded and said, "I understand." The weakling then begged him to unleash the power of justice, but Mr. Justice smiled and said:</p>
<p>Nodding to you and saying "I understand" is what is called justice. You must know that the word "justice" means "your Lord has his own reasons." You need not plead any further, justice, justice, your Lord has his own reasons. The weakling, still not understanding, heard of a second Mr. Justice living on the other side of the Atlantic; so the weakling crossed the Atlantic to beg the second Mr. Justice to lend a helping hand; the second Mr. Justice merely said: it is inconvenient to interfere, and if interference is necessary, it must wait. The weakling hurriedly asked: When will the power of justice be unleashed? The second Mr. Justice yawned and said:</p>
<p>For me to lend you a hand, the time is not yet right; you must know that the word "justice" means: "This matter can only be addressed after the world belongs to everyone." You need not plead any further, justice, justice, I will address your matter when the world belongs to everyone.</p>
<p>The weakling became even more disappointed, and then heard that a third Mr. Justice lived on the other side of the Mediterranean; so he crossed the Mediterranean to beg the third Mr. Justice to lend a helping hand; the third Mr. Justice, suddenly showing anger, shouted at the weakling:</p>
<p>I was just about to look for you, but you ran to my door yourself; quickly hand over your life and property, one by one, to the three of us, Mr. Justices! From now on, you will have no sovereignty! You must know that the word "justice" means "public management." Justice, justice, means that your, the weakling's, life and property will all be placed under the public management of us, the Justices.</p>

<p>— Xu Qinfu</p>
<p>Also the Most Pitiful Person in a Puppet State</p>
<p>My apologies to Mr. Puyi, although he is now under the manipulation and control of the Japanese, serving as the so-called Chief Executive of Manchukuo, and this so-called Manchukuo has recently received formal recognition from the Japanese, and is actually pretending to be an independent country (!), a fan-sized hand cannot cover the eyes and ears of the world. Can this Manchukuo of his be considered a country? The judgment of public opinion is still pending. Playing emperor behind closed doors is ultimately nothing more than childish antics. Since this is the case, before the Republic of China revoked his nationality, our Mr. Puyi is, in any case, still a Chinese person, and indeed the most pitiful person in China!</p>
<p>How can it be said that Mr. Puyi is the most pitiful person in China? The most pitiful people in China are naturally the thirty million compatriots in the Northeast, but they can still rise up to resist the Japanese, or at the very least, find ways to escape into the interior. Only Mr. Puyi has completely lost his freedom of movement, unable to escape and unable to die! His position has already been described by himself as "worse than a puppet!" Today's newspapers report that he again said to people, "I really can't go on!" In fact, the so-called "can't go on" is still more accurately and poignantly expressed by the phrase "worse than a puppet." Because from the time he left Tianjin, was taken to Manchuria, and until he assumed the position of Chief Executive and signed the treaty of recognition with the Japanese, what has he actually done in these months? Furthermore, every action, every word of his, was done by someone else. Merely saying "can't go on" suggests that he tried to do something. But now, he has never done anything, cannot do anything, and is being done by others. This is truly what is meant by "worse than a puppet!"</p>
<p>Therefore, China's Mr. Puyi is indeed the most pitiful person! In other words, even if we respectfully call him the Grand Chief Executive of Manchukuo, he is still the most pitiful person among the thirty million people of Manchuria!</p>
<h3>Cricket's Song</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Ah! You little autumn insect, in the rubble, desolate among the fine grasses, chirping loudly, like a cunning rabbit, hiding in its burrow, like a wooden rooster, upholding its solitary loyalty.</p>
<p>····················</p>
<p>Ah! You little autumn insect, you also resemble a fanged and clawed hero. Pitiful, you exert all your eight-sided might, only to be caught by mischievous children and imprisoned.</p>
<p>························</p>
<p>Ah! You little autumn insect, still dreaming good dreams in the darkness. Listening to people's manipulations, you destroy your own kind. Laughing at those officials who lost their country, emptying their wallets, throwing them into your jaws.</p>
<h3>Ions and Beauties</h3>
<p>— Fan Ru</p>
<p>丨A Record of King Wen's Great Mistake Once丨</p>
<p>The Book of Changes says "Li means beautiful", if we add the word "zi" to both, it becomes "Lizi is beautiful, zi is too".</p>
<p>Ions are considered in modern science to be a fundamental element of creation with yin and yang divisions, and whether yin or yang, they are constantly seeking to combine with the opposite sex. Of course, if there is any opportunity to take advantage of, they will readily merge. Ancient people called beautiful women "Lizi", which shows that wonderful girls are particularly able to nakedly express their "ionic nature". Modern girls, in order to win the title of "Lizi", fully perform their "ionic nature", such as naked jade legs, Himalayan-like breasts, all of which are used to express the sage's meaning of "Li means beauty". But men are thus easily tempted to commit crimes, which is naturally all due to King Wen's harm. Because people say that the hexagram statements in the Book of Changes were written by King Wen, so I will temporarily record King Wen's great mistake once here.</p>
<h3>Friends from Afar</h3>
<p>— Luan Zhen</p>
<p>丨Beautiful Shanghai丨</p>
<p>"I have never been so depressed, I never thought coming home would be like that. Everything around me is absolutely different from Shanghai. Everything feels isolated from the outside world. Going to Sichuan is like going to another world." My friend Yingbing, who recently came from Sichuan, said this to us right away.</p>
<p>"I really regret missing the opportunity to swim in Shanghai. Sigh, friends," she sighed heavily with unusual disappointment.</p>
<p>"...If you think I am as happy as you imagine, you are completely wrong. Who has your carefree life in Shanghai, with red and green girls displaying themselves for you to admire? All I see there are uncivilized people all day long, nothing else, let alone anything modern," said my old classmate Chen, who works in Changzhou, with the same kind of lament about Shanghai.</p>
<p>"Ping, I feel like I've walked into a desert. Although it's my beloved hometown, it can't satisfy everything I need. I'm back, I'm back in the embrace of beautiful Shanghai. Friends, let's go to the Majestic tonight, have a great time, it's on me, let's dance until dawn," said my classmate Wang, who works in a certain department in Nanjing, taking the express train on Saturday to make such an invitation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>"Shanghai, beautiful Shanghai (?) Everyone praises it! I thought.</p>
<h3>The Characteristics a Good Youth Should Have</h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>Among us young people, there are countless who do not carefully observe things. A prejudiced character has fostered a weak ability to judge things with precise methods. This has created all sorts of evils in the world. For example, many principles are clearly fictitious or based on a strong subjective view. However, they take it as truth, believing it without doubt. This kind of character is indeed extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>I believe that a good youth should have a firm and decisive character forged by reason. That is to say, when it comes to our personal conduct, dealing with the world, aspirations, actions, etc., we should see everything clearly and pursue what we believe is right and great with unwavering determination. Even if our ambitions are not realized, our goals are not achieved, or we are often misunderstood, we should not care or regret it. Conversely, everything, after careful consideration from the front, back, and sides with our precise reason, should be stopped immediately if we realize it is wrong, without any hesitation or lingering. This is what constitutes the character of a good youth. This character is like the driving force of the engine on the road to success!</p>
<h3>The Rotary Club Serial: Silver Threads (22)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>(11)</p>
<p>After Director Yuan arrived, their program, after much discussion, decided that the unveiling should be at the very end, especially as strongly advocated by the county magistrate, because if the unveiling was done before the speech, those villagers would definitely scatter, and no one would be willing to listen to the speech, which would not be good for the order of the meeting, and it would also be very bad for Director Yuan's face.</p>
<p>The county magistrate was not the chairman, because this was a gathering of the people, but his reading of the Premier's will and his words made it seem as if he was the chairman. Zhu Bofang was very unhappy in his heart, but there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>Director Yuan himself gave a speech, and everyone in the audience automatically applauded. He said: "We soldiers are like a woman marrying a husband. According to the old rules in China, a woman is not allowed to divorce her husband. Since divorce is not allowed, no matter how much suffering she endures, it is her own fault. Therefore, we soldiers should devote our bodies and lives to the country. Not an inch of land can be taken away by other countries. Defending the territory is our duty. This is what we should do, there is no glory in it. Moreover, this is my hometown, how can I not risk my life to defend it? Thank you, elders, brothers, sisters, for donating money to build a memorial碑, I really don't deserve it, it makes me feel very ashamed and very grateful..." The people in the town were still filled with the old teachings, so they applauded enthusiastically. But Miss Zhu Qilan, after listening, felt an unspeakable discomfort in her heart. Since she was a child, Bofang had arranged a marriage for her. Her fiancé was the small owner of an oil, sauce, and sundries shop in the town. After graduating from the local elementary school, he did not go to middle school, but Zhu Qilan had already graduated from a noble church girls' middle school in Shanghai. She was very dissatisfied with this marriage. She did not want to be the small owner's wife in an oil and sauce shop. The husband she hoped for had to be rich, powerful, and preferably a very famous official. Therefore, at this time, she firmly requested the dissolution of the engagement. Coincidentally, the small owner of the oil and sauce shop was also very unrestrained and looked down on Zhu Qilan's arrogant and extravagant attitude, so he agreed to dissolve the engagement unconditionally. Now, Zhu Qilan heard Director Yuan's speech, and her face couldn't help but turn red. She was slightly shocked in her heart. She did not expect Director Yuan's mind to be so stubborn, but he was admired by the people of the whole town and praised by the people of the whole country, because he was a hero against the enemy. He had already become famous. As a director, he must also be very wealthy, which was just right for the qualities of the husband she needed to find. She identified her goal and wanted to start making her hopes a reality. She decided to give a speech too, so that she could demonstrate her talents to attract Yuan's attention, or maybe even make him fall in love with her.</p>
<p>Some people in the audience also recognized Director Yuan. It seemed that there used to be a poor scholar named Yuan Hefu in the town, who was the husband of Yuan the Madman. But the former Yuan Hefu had been missing for several years. People in the audience were only discussing it quietly, and no one dared to speak loudly or ask Director Yuan about it truthfully.</p>
<p>But Zhu Qilan was twice as old as Director Yuan. She didn't know anything about Yuan Hefu at all. She had already considered it herself, even if the age difference was greater, it didn't matter. It was very popular and honorable for modern young women to marry officials who were very old. She wanted to show off her talents and attract Yuan's attention on the spot. She also decided to give a speech.</p>

<h3>Sharp Downward Turn in Financial Gold Market</h3>
<p>Plunging Twelve Taels Four Mace  Yesterday, the gold market experienced a sharp decline, with a complex and volatile situation. However, the difference was not significant, at most three taels. The total fluctuation for the day was only within eight taels. The result was a massive drop of more than twelve taels, attributed to the international silver market, where both near and forward contracts were reported to have risen. U.S. cotton and stock markets also generally increased, leading to a sharp initial drop. In particular, selling from Guangdong merchants and the emergence of long positions attracted the attention of the industry. Various firms followed suit and vigorously sold off. Furthermore, the unusually weak foreign exchange market further frightened sentiment, subsequently breaking the 720 tael mark. The market became increasingly weak, with strong selling pressure. The weakness of both British and American exchange rates and the general downward trend of the market led to a new low of 715 taels (since the market opened on the 16th). Short positions saw a glimmer of hope. In the past two days, the total decline has been more than twenty taels. Spot prices were sold by Tongfengheng, Shoufengcheng, etc. to the Central Bank for 210 bars at a price of 721 taels, with delivery in November. Various firms had a large amount of bars, estimated to be over 20,000, etc. The details of the market's movements are recorded below.</p>
<p>Morning Opening Plunges Six Taels  Opening at 722 taels 7 qian in the morning, the market immediately fell six taels. Large bars rose slightly by 1/16 to 1/8, and U.S. silver rose by 1/8. However, private telegrams increased by 3/8, and despite the small exchange rate, the forward silver rate was more than 3% higher. U.S. cotton surged by over 50 points. Yuhé, Bingxing, Hongkangyong, and others were reported to have bought in at 21 taels 2 qian, immediately adding one tael, zero mace, to 22 taels 4 qian, absorbed by Hua Bi in January at US$31.125. Subsequently, it became difficult to sell off. Furthermore, Fuchang, Yifeng, Bingxing, Fuyu, Hengyu, Yuantai, Yuhe, Tongtaichang, Yongfeng, and others were selling off, immediately causing a drop of four taels. The U.S. dollar became even stronger, with banks offering prices of US$31.3125 to .375. HSBC also released September British gold at 1.9375, reaching 18 taels 2 qian at 9:20 AM. Hengxing bought in at this point, immediately adding one tael, zero mace, to 19 taels 5 qian. When HSBC posted increases of .375 for both British and American exchange rates, the price retreated to 18 taels 3 qian. After adding another six or seven mace, Yifeng continued to sell off, with Tongtaichang, Bingxing, Yuanxingyong, Xiexingyong, Fuxingyong, Yuantai, Hengyu, and Zhaofengchang selling without reservation. Additionally, the December U.S. dollar was priced at 2 yuan, with January at .375, and October could be settled at US$30.875. The gold price continued to decline, reaching 16 taels 6 qian at 9:47 AM. Subsequently, Hengyu, Yongfeng, Hengxing, Yifengyong, Futaiheng, Fuchang, Zhifengyong, and others took advantage of this to buy in. Arbitrageurs also purchased. Wheat firms absorbed 25 in January, Meifeng absorbed .1875, and HSBC bought .0625 in December. Furthermore, the Central Bank bought spot goods, leading to a surge of three taels, reaching 19 taels 8 qian at 10:30 AM. Unexpectedly, Yifeng, Yuanxingyong, Chengfengyong, Yuhe, Yuantai, Richang, and others continued to sell, weakening the market further. A bleak atmosphere filled the market until a second drop to 16 taels 6 qian at just after 11:10 AM. Shortly after, Anda, Hua Bi, HSBC, and others absorbed US$31.125 in January again. Because Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong, and commodity hedgers came to buy, the price recovered to 18 taels 7 qian. After 11:30 AM, there was some fluctuation, and Tongtaichang and others continued to sell off, to US$.875 in September. The market closed at 17 taels 7 qian at noon, and then traded again at 7 taels 5 qian.</p>
<p>Market Declines Further  The afternoon market opened at 17 taels 8 qian, then fluctuated from 7 taels 2 qian to 8 taels 4 mace 1 qian. However, Zhifengyong, Tongdachang, Taiheng, and Hengyu all sold off. HSBC released U.S. dollars for October at US$30.0875, reaching 16 taels 6 qian at 2:10 PM. Shortly after, Zhifengyong, Fuyu, Fuxingyong, Yuantai, and others bought in, and Hua Bi Shanghai absorbed US$31.125 in January. After a quarter of an hour, the price increased by 2 taels 1 mace to 18 taels 7 qian. After 2:30 PM, the market weakened again due to Tongtaichang, Bingxing, Yuanxingyong, Zhaofengchang, and others selling off, reaching 15 taels 8 mace at 3:15 PM. Because Fuxingyong, Yifengyong, and Zhifengyong came in to buy, the price recovered by one tael or so, reaching 17 taels 1 mace at 3:30 PM. However, the exchange market remained weak, with January at .375. With strong selling pressure on the market, Zhifengyong, Zhaofengchang, and general retail long positions tended to liquidate. In an instant, the market fell back into a state of weakness, seemingly on the verge of collapse, seeing a new low price of 15 taels at just after 4:00 PM. Subsequently, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanxingyong, Yuantai, Hengchangyong, and hedgers came to buy in, immediately raising the price by one tael and several qian, reaching 16 taels 7 qian at 4:25 PM. Unexpectedly, Yifeng suddenly sold off over 300 bars, immediately falling to 15 taels 9 qian. Hengyu and Bingxing bought in. The market closed at 4:30 PM at 16 taels 3 mace, a sharp drop of 12 taels 4 mace compared to the previous noon. Trading then continued at around 16 taels. The largest daily fluctuation was 22 taels 7 qian, and the smallest was 15 taels, a difference of 7 taels 7 qian. The net increase was 15 taels.</p>
<p>Opening Prices Depress by Three Taels  The opening price was quoted at US$3.75, subsequently changed to 790 taels, depressing by 71 or 72 taels. In the afternoon, the price was 73 to 71 taels, then 75 taels, and finally 73 or 74 taels, depressing by three taels compared to the previous day. Before logging, the market was at 28 taels for September and October, and 18 taels for November. The water supplement was 24 taels in the morning and 22 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Long Positions Massively Liquidated  Trading on the floor was quite active, but selling pressure was extremely strong. Statistics show that Yuanmaoyong, Hengxing, Yuhe, Futaiheng, and Tongfengheng all bought in. Zhifengyong, Shunli, Dadecheng, Yuanheng, and Fuchang experienced frequent buying and selling. Chengfengyong, Hengchangyong, Hengyu, Fuyu, Yuantai, Yifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Fuxingyong, Xiexingyong, Hongkangyong, Bingxing, and Yuanxingyong all liquidated. Yifeng liquidated several thousand bars. Hengxing bought in over 600 bars. Tongtaichang bought and sold 1600 or 1700 bars, breaking even. Wanxing bought and sold two or three hundred bars, with more selling than buying. In the afternoon, Yuantai, Xingyong, Ruixing, Yuanmaobing, and Hengchangyong all bought in.

Additionally, Yifeng massively liquidated over 4000 long positions, and Bingxing sold more than bought, some on behalf of customers. The rest was complex and disorderly.</p>

The U.S. dollar only increased by 375. Due to exchange rate factors, Hong Kong suddenly increased by 25, and all other rates were lowered.

<h3>New York Stock Market Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Sin Fung Trading Company, on Wednesday, the 21st, the New York stock market continued the strong upward trend from the previous day's closing and rose sharply. The opening price was already two to three dollars higher, and although there was a large amount of selling, it was all absorbed. After a re-evaluation, the condition of the US Steel Corporation was reported to be better, and the preferred stock dividend was about to be canceled, which immediately led to a surge in the stock price. In addition, the London and Paris stock markets were strong, further enlivening the market. The bulls and bears fought fiercely, but the bears were ultimately unable to resist and rushed to cover their positions.

The entire day's trading was brisk, with a total volume of 4.3 million shares. According to the Steel Age report, the steel industry is expected to make significant progress after October, as the automotive and railway industries will have large demands.

<h3>Sharp Rebound in Cotton Yarn and Cotton Markets</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market has suddenly turned bullish, with a sharp upward trend. This situation is entirely due to too many short sellers and recent excessive pressure. Additionally, customers typically make purchases during the autumn season, which has slightly improved the environment. At the same time, demand is increasing, and the sudden rebound in American cotton has caused unease among general short sellers, leading to a sudden rise in market prices. In short, the underlying cotton yarn inventory is too low, resulting in a faster rebound.</p>
<p>"Ren Biao" Up 3.5 Taels</p>
<p>The "Ren Biao" market opened with rising American cotton. There was a shortage of sellers in the market, and short sellers covered their positions. Each month rose by 2.9 qian to 3.1 qian.

<h3>New Landscape Reappears in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is excellent, with a very sharp upward trend. Due to the sudden rebound of American cotton by sixty points per pound, the long-depressed local cotton has shown a new landscape. Seeing the rise in foreign cotton, general short sellers have no choice but to cover their positions painfully. The upward trend in the market is becoming tighter and tighter, and a certain manufacturer is still selling and adding to their shorts. Currently, it is still the time for new cotton to enter the market, and there are still quite a few people selling forward. What the future holds still depends on the movements of foreign cotton.</p>
<p>"Zheng Biao" Rises Sharply by 1.3 Taels</p>
<p>The "Zheng Biao" market opened with rising American cotton, and there was a shortage of sellers in the market, making the market atmosphere particularly tight. Each month rose by 9 qian to 8.5 qian and 1 tael. The market situation remained buoyant in the afternoon, with each month rising again by 2.5 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 48,100 dan. Major sellers included Ming De (4,000 dan), Sui Long (7,000 dan), Tai Xing (3,600 dan), Heng De (2,200 dan), Da Chang (2,100 dan), Xin Cheng (2,200 dan), and Mei Ji (2,400 bales).

<p>Strong Buying Power for American Cotton</p>
<p>Rises Sharply by 56-60 Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose sharply due to bulk buying, strength from Wall Street, and poor harvest conditions. Futures rose by 55 to 60 points, spot goods rose by 55 points. British cotton futures rose 14-15 points, spot goods rose 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose 15 points. Indian cotton market was closed.

<h3>Grains: Lower River Rice Market Raises Prices and Reduces Stock</h3>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, more than ten boats arrived from various groups. The market was sluggish, and new粳rice was scarce, causing a sudden increase of one to two jiao. Prices for middle-grade goods also increased by a jiao. Letters from Changshu and Xixi reported that prices for糙rice were tightening, with upward momentum. Qing解薄稻and goods from Jiashan Xitang, etc., all increased by one jiao. Yang杜尖, purchased by customer groups, saw inventories dwindle, and prices were said to have increased by a jiao.</p>
<p>New Gate: Yesterday, there were not many goods arriving. Total boat cargo inventory was about 15,000 dan. Trading on the street was sluggish. New and old Northern粳rice saw an increase of one to two jiao. Currently, prices are consistently tightening. The source of薄稻is becoming increasingly scarce. Although urban and rural appetite is flat, prices have increased by a jiao. Customer purchases of零拆are excellent, with no price fluctuations. New Yang杜尖is mostly replaced by small绞米, with no increase or decrease in price.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Has Unusually Brisk Opening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months suddenly showed a sharp upward trend, with quotations for foreign wheat rebounding by as much as five to eight or nine jiao. Therefore, after the opening, sentiment immediately turned expensive, rising one to two fen compared to the previous day's closing price. However, although manufacturers were not actively selling, Fu Xin made slight sales in line with the market. As a result, morning trading was concentrated entirely on the opening. Prices fluctuated in subsequent trades. By the time the afternoon market opened, the current month had once softened, but trading in distant months stagnated again as manufacturers did not move. Market prices barely changed. Looking ahead, much will still depend on foreign wheat and whether manufacturers will set prices for foreign wheat. As a result, the current month rose by 7.5 li compared to the previous day, October rose by 1.5 fen, November rose by 1.25 fen, and December to February each rose by 1.7 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Tightens in the Morning, Loosens in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, prices for all months showed a firm trend. The price of foreign wheat rebounded by five to eight or nine jiao. It was reported that the increase in the price of foreign wheat was due to the US election, which raised prices. According to this reasoning, it is nothing more than what people hope for. At the opening of the market, the initial price for the current month was only 4 qian and 7 fen, but the price also firmed up due to the surge of buyers. However, the distant months had already invisibly risen, but trading was not very active, and the trend remained loose. By the time the afternoon market opened, the market situation had turned stagnant, with little up or down compared to the morning closing price. If foreign wheat still changes, it will be difficult to expect too high. As a result, the current month rose by 3 fen compared to the previous day, October rose by 4 fen, November rose by 2 fen, and December to February each rose by 4 fen. The spot wheat was generally stable, and trading was also active. The opening price for Yao Bay wheat was 3 taels and 5 qian and 2 fen, Tongzhou wheat was 3 taels and 3 qian and 5 fen, Bengbu wheat was 3 taels and 5 qian, Shaoxing wheat was 3 taels and 3 qian and 7 fen, and Chongming wheat was 3 taels and 3 qian and 7 fen, totaling 2,500 packages.</p>
<p>Dry Goods and Sundries: New Dried Longan High-Grade Goods are in Short Supply</p>
<p>More than 1,200 boxes of new dried longan from Quanzhou arrived the day before yesterday. An investigation revealed that various firms had received shipments, but high-grade goods were scarce, causing the market to tighten. Medium and low-grade goods arrived from Guangdong, Zhangzhou, Tong'an, etc., in large quantities, suddenly creating an impression of oversupply and causing market prices to fall. It is expected that trading will open today, with high-grade goods expected to be priced above 30 taels.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White Drops by 2.5 Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the exchange rate for the Dutch currency was flat, the marker price had already fallen sharply. Therefore, the trend of the guild's price setting turned flat. The price for the 24th grade coarse sand white was set at 14 taels, 5 qian, and 7.5 fen, which was 2.5 fen lower than the previous day. The price for special high-grade goods was set at 14 taels, 7 qian, and 2.5 fen. The number plate for the 20th grade medium sand white was 14 taels. The number plate gradually turned green at 9 taels and 2 qian, with a slight opening compared to the previous slightly smaller opening. The quality of洋刁靑goods was still good, but since other grades of青sugar were falling in price, the opinions of firms on both sides had not yet converged, resulting in no agreement.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: New Factories in Wuxi are Continuously Transporting Goods to Shanghai</p>
<p>More than 200 pieces have been shipped within the past few days...preparing for delivery by the end of the month.</p>
<p>There are a total of 53 silk factories in Wuxi. After the new cocoons entered the market, only a little over 10 factories barely resumed work. Last month, the silk sales in Europe and America turned around, and the silk factories resumed operations one after another. Currently, the number of silk factories that have started work in Wuxi has reached 24, and the silk production is gradually increasing. Since the end of September is approaching, the current month's futures silk sold by each silk factory to various European and American banks must be delivered on time. Therefore, the inventory silk is being transported to Shanghai by land. In the past two or three days, new factory goods from Wuxi have been transported to Shanghai, totaling 245 pieces, preparing for delivery to foreign banks by the end of the month. As for the silk market in this port's foreign banks, due to the lack of overseas silk sales recently, market prices have been falling, and telegrams are not being forwarded, continuing to show a sluggish trend.</p>
<p>Black and Green Tea Both Trend Downward</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading in foreign tea remained quiet. European firms were still demanding strict prices for both Keemun black tea and Lushan local green tea. The price for Zhenmei from Wuyuan fell to around 100 taels, Tunxi fell to around 80 taels, and She County fell to around 70 taels. The market is pessimistic. The whereabouts of Keemun Hua Xiang Mo has been stagnant for a long time. It was heard yesterday that British firms such as Tong Fu, Tian Yu, and Jin Long had already sent telegrams out, setting the price for Hua Xiang at 9 taels. As for other black teas, there was still no interest.</p>
<p>Textiles: Flannel Base Market Sales Increase Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the textile market was still good. Flannel and flannel base prices were as firm as in the previous weeks. There was not much Dong Dao inventory. Market sales had increased slightly. Colors such as peach red, cyan green, and watery grey were very attractive. Mixed color flannel, because the selling price was too expensive, was showing signs of declining. Yesterday, Taihe Da Zongtong, Ningfeng, and Qingtiantu were all sold for 6 taels and 4 qian and a half, Ningfeng flannel base for 7 taels and 5 qian, and Miyi brand for 12 taels and 7 qian and a half.</p>
<p>Metals: 200 Tons of Rebar Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday, the metal market was still deserted. Few large-volume goods were opened for sale, due to tight credit and suppression of bandits in various regions, making it difficult to see progress in business. The originally important destination of Yantai had recently stopped taking orders due to the infighting between Zhuan Han and Liu. Neighboring Qingdao and Jinan also sent telegrams to stop taking orders, so northern business can be said to be cut off. Southern business had not seen new progress since the Mid-Autumn Festival. Fortunately, both imports and exports in various markets have been minimal recently, allowing the standard to stand firm without falling. The main points are described below:</p>
<p>Construction Industry Purchases 200+ Tons of Rebar</p>
<p>Construction industry firms such as Xin Zhong Ji, Gui Lan Ji, and Xin Jin Ji purchased more than 230 tons of rebar at a tea party yesterday. The price was based on discarding the end-of-month futures, so it was 2 taels cheaper than the spot market. It is estimated that the price per ton was 63 taels and 5 qian. It was heard that the seller was a metal shop on North Suzhou Road.</p>
<p>The Trend for Black Iron Sheet is Stirring</p>
<p>With the autumn wind blowing cold and the leaves of the paulownia tree falling, northern customer groups are purchasing black iron sheet for use in stoves and torches for warmth, with a wide range of outlets. However, due to tight finances this year, sales were greatly reduced. Not much was opened for sale in recent days. However, compared to the previous dull atmosphere, it is felt that there is a stirring trend. It was heard that the opening price for the 18-gauge product was estimated at 8 taels and 5 qian per dan, secondary grade 8 taels per dan, and 3-8 36-inch sheets were estimated at 8 taels and 2 qian and a half, 9-10 sheets at 8 taels and 7 qian and a half, and 11-13 sheets at 9 taels and 2 qian and a half.</p>

<h3>Judgment in the Yun Huifang Case</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Bail During Appeal Period</p>
<p>| Lawyer Li’s Arguments Were Appropriate |</p>
<p>| Chief Prosecutor Wang’s Argument Was Fair |</p>
<p>Young Yun Huifang was previously arrested by the Chinese police for using explosives to warn unscrupulous merchants, and subsequently transferred to the First Special District Local Court, where she was granted bail. These details have been reported in previous issues.</p>
<p>The court was heavily guarded. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continued hearing of the case. Considering the crowded conditions during previous hearings, the court authorities, in order to maintain order, ordered Chinese and Western bailiffs to be stationed inside and outside the First Court, conducting strict inspections. The Public Concession police authorities dispatched a large team of armed Chinese, Western, and Indian detectives, led by Chinese and Western Inspectors Yao Jialin and Sinclair, in police vehicles to the courthouse entrance. A portion of the detectives dismounted to assist the bailiffs in reinforcing guard posts around the court, while the rest were dispersed around the outside of the court or remained in the vehicles. The severity of the security and the thoroughness of the precautions were evident. However, this tense atmosphere deterred many potential spectators, so the First Court did not feel particularly crowded, with an estimated two to three hundred people in attendance.</p>
<p>Yun Huifang's Demeanor. At 2:10 PM, Yun Huifang arrived at the court with five friends and relatives. Yun was wearing a dark blue striped Zhongshan suit, with a freshly cut hairstyle, radiating with energy and sporting a cheerful smile. After entering the court, she sat in the back row among the crowd, but still attracted the attention of the audience, with gazes focusing on her. At this time, the police lawyers Gan Jingxian and Li Zhishan, the defendant's lawyers Li Zuyu, Shen Junru, and Zhao Chen, and the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case were all present. The presiding judge of the First Criminal Court, Qian Hongye, and the chief prosecutor Wang Zuze, along with the court clerk, took their seats, and ordered Yun Huifang to be brought to the defendant's dock to stand trial.</p>
<p>Announcement of Renewed Trial. First, her name, age, and address were confirmed, and then it was announced that the case was being retried today. Then, the police lawyer Li Zhishan (note that this case was originally handled by lawyer Ru Baoyi, but lawyer Ru is currently on leave in the countryside and could not attend court, so Li and Gan were taking over the case) rose and stated that there were three charges against the defendant, namely (1) attempted murder in violation of Article 282, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, (2) obstruction of freedom in violation of Article 318 of the Criminal Law, and (3) possession of explosives for the purpose of committing a crime in violation of Article 200 of the Criminal Law. He stated that the obstruction of freedom occurred at 11:00 AM on July 27, when the defendant personally delivered a threatening letter and a hand grenade in a square tin can to the Cotton Cloth Association on Shanxi Road. The tea server of the association received it. The defendant, without waiting for questioning, turned and fled. Later, the people in the association read the letter, which contained many warnings, and together with the can, sent it to the police. The bomb in the can was found to be very explosive.</p>
<p>Yongchang Zheng Bomb Incident. On the morning of July 28, the defendant and Cai Yaozu went to Xinzha Road and threw a bomb into the Yongchang Coal Company, which exploded instantly, injuring one of the company's employees. The police initially did not know that the defendant had committed the above two cases, until August 5, when the defendant was arrested for throwing a bomb at the Maochang Foreign Cloth Store in the French Concession. The General Inspectorate applied to the Second Special Court to bring her to the police for investigation, and it was then discovered that it was also conspired and implemented by the defendant and the fugitive Cai Yaozu.</p>
<p>Basis of the Police Accusation. According to the defendant's confession to the police, she admitted that she personally delivered the letter and bomb to the Cotton Cloth Association. In the Yongchang case, Cai threw the bomb, while she was only on the roadside as a lookout. She also stated that the bomb was left over from when she retired from the Volunteer Army. She and Cai each had two bombs. Except for the three used, there was still one remaining at her residence at 207 Park Road. The detectives took the defendant to search the premises and found one bomb. She had already been sentenced to two months in prison by the Second Special Court for throwing a bomb at Maochang, with a two-year suspended sentence due to her youth. The police filed the accusation based on the defendant's confession and the investigation.</p>
<p>Report of the Western Inspector. Western Inspector Gallagher then reported that after taking the defendant from the French Concession to the police for questioning, based on her confession, they went to the defendant's and Cai Yaozu's residence at 207 Park Road and found a bomb. They went to the Cotton Cloth Association and the Yongchang Coal Company to investigate, and the defendant demonstrated Cai Yaozu's posture when throwing the bomb. He presented the threatening letter, tin can, shrapnel, and other evidence. Lawyer Li also presented the photos taken after the bombing of Yongchang and the diagrams drawn.</p>
<p>Statement of Zhu Ashan. Zhu Ashan, the tea server of the Cotton Cloth Association, was then called as a witness and questioned about the circumstances of receiving the threatening letter and the tin can. He stated that at the time, a young man delivered it, claiming to be sent by an adult and left the item with him, then turned and left. At the time, he had no doubts about what was in the can. After reading the letter, he realized that the can contained a bomb and reported it to the police. However, he did not pay attention to the young man's face at the time, and it is even more difficult to identify him now.</p>
<p>Throwing the Bomb Without Intending to Hurt Anyone. Judge Qian then questioned the defendant, who stated that she had sent the letter and bomb to the Cotton Cloth Association, and she could not remember the recipient's appearance. She did not say anything at the time, because the recipient grabbed her sleeve and she hurried away. The letter was written by Cai Yaozu, so Cai also agreed to this action. First, they investigated and found that members of the association were selling Japanese goods, so they sent a letter to warn them. Because they ignored the warning, they gave them a bomb as a gift. If they still did not repent, their last resort was to throw the bomb, but the purpose was definitely not to hurt anyone, only to damage their property. If they knew that someone was present, they would not have acted rashly. The letters were all signed by the Blood Soul Extermination Group. They had sent two warnings to the association beforehand. Because they did not repent, they sent them a bomb.</p>
<p>The Bomb Had Already Exploded When I Arrived. On the morning of July 28, Cai went to Xinzha Road first, intending to give a bomb as a gift. By the time she arrived, it had already exploded. So she asked Cai why. According to Cai, the bomb was wrapped in newspaper, and he was afraid that someone would grab him when he handed it over, so he threw the bomb into the coal pile, not expecting it to explode. This was truly unexpected. But what she said now was slightly different from what she said to the police before, because she was confused at the time. Judge Qian read the defendant's confession to the police, which included the words "When Cai threw the bomb, I was on the roadside." She was asked which statement was accurate. Yun replied that what she said today was true. As for the demonstration of throwing the bomb at Yongchang later with the detectives, it was purely based on what Cai had told her after throwing the bomb, and she was imitating him. Because when she arrived, it was after the explosion, she had no idea how he threw it. Although they had discussed it the night before, she only knew that Cai was sending the bomb.</p>
<p>Yun and Cai Each Had Two Bombs. At this point, lawyer Li Zuyu asked Yun. She replied that when the volunteer army retired, she and Cai each brought back two bombs. She had already sent one bomb to the Cotton Cloth Association and one to Maochang. Only Cai's two bombs were left, so the one given to Yongchang must have been Cai's bomb, and Cai delivered it himself. Cai was about 20 years old, and she was 16 years old. Cai was more knowledgeable than her, so she always discussed things with Cai first, and Cai would not agree to things without her consent.</p>
<p>Whether It Constitutes Obstruction of Freedom. Because all the witnesses had been questioned, Judge Qian ordered the debate to begin. Lawyer Li spoke first, saying that the Cotton Cloth Association case was being prosecuted for obstruction of freedom under Article 318 of the Criminal Law. The defendant has now admitted it, and what needs to be studied is whether the defendant has the right to obstruct other people's freedom. According to Article 37 of the current Provisional Constitution, people have freedom of occupation. If their business violates good morals or the law, there is national law to punish them. Selling Japanese goods is a matter of personal morality, and China and Japan have not severed diplomatic relations, so the government has no order to prohibit people from selling Japanese goods. People enjoy absolute freedom to do business. If resisting Japanese goods means that the defendant takes actions of violence and coercion instead of persuading in good faith, it cannot be excused as not being a crime. For example, possessing opium is a crime, and robbing someone who does so is also a crime. The situation in this case is the same.</p>
<p>Attention Should Be Paid to the Confession. As for the attempted murder, the police investigation and the defendant's confession are mostly consistent. Although the defendant's statement today is contrary to what she said before, they are all empty words. Whether they are credible should be considered. Therefore, in this case, the defendant and Cai Yaozu conspired beforehand and were on the lookout during the event, so there is no doubt that they are accomplices. As for the charge of possessing explosives, since a bomb for the purpose of committing a crime was found, the crime is undoubtedly established.</p>
<p>The Defendant Was Originally Admirable. The defendant is a young person, and her actions were originally admirable, but from a legal point of view, they are criminal acts. People have an obligation to abide by the law, so the law should protect the people. Those who infringe on people's freedom and disrupt social stability should be punished by law. Therefore, there are things that are commendable in terms of morality, but may still be illegal in terms of law. Selling Japanese goods violates public sentiment, but it does not violate the law. The court is where the law is enforced, and it is hoped that the law will be upheld fairly and not bend the law to suit the person. Since this case occurred, there have been more than forty kinds of so-called groups with similar names. They are committing crimes in the name of warning, so how can they be accommodated? What danger could be greater? China used to be ruled by men, but now it has reached the rule of law. Those who commit crimes must be punished to establish the spirit of the rule of law and maintain the dignity of judicial independence. However, the defendant is young and not yet an adult, so it is hoped that the sentencing will be given careful consideration.</p>
<p>Defense by the Defendant's Lawyers. Lawyers Li, Shen, and Zhao then each made a defense. Zhao spoke first, making a lengthy and theoretical argument. Li and Shen made a detailed analysis of the facts. In summary, they argued that the charge of obstructing freedom was related to the case in the French Concession and should be dismissed. As for the attempted murder, it was Cai Yaozu who committed the crime, and Yun should not be held responsible. As for the possession of explosives, it was discovered due to another matter, and the bomb found was not Yun's, so it should not be related to Yun.</p>
<p>Chief Prosecutor Wang's Argument. Finally, Chief Prosecutor Wang argued that the obstruction of freedom was a continuous act and should be dismissed. The attempted murder charge was inappropriate and should be judged as a charge of injury. As for the possession of explosives, since it was not a separate criminal act, it should be punished together with other crimes, with the most severe punishment being applied.</p>
<p>Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment. Judge Qian then announced the court's verdict in court: Yun Huifang was found guilty of jointly using a method that could cause death to injure a person, and her sentence was reduced to three months in prison. The charge that she threw a bomb and a threatening letter at the Cotton Cloth Association on Shanxi Road was dismissed. The hand grenade and shrapnel were confiscated and destroyed. During the appeal period, Yun Huifang was released on her original bail. After the verdict, Yun was bailed out by her original guarantor.</p>
<h3>Wu Chaoshu's Remarks Upon Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Visiting Pingjin for Sightseeing</p>
<p>Departure Date Not Yet Set</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Central Committee members Wu Chaoshu, Chen Ce, Zheng Hongnian, and others have returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou. Yesterday, reporters visited Wu at his residence and inquired about his plans to go to Pingjin and the rumors of a Russo-Japanese alliance. According to Wu, he did not visit Mr. Wang Jingwei during his trip to Hangzhou. He had not been to Pingjin for more than ten years and planned to go there soon, but he had not decided on the date of departure or whether to travel by sea or land. In general, if the Pingpu Railway is safe, he will go to Nanjing first and then transfer to Pingjin. Whether Mr. Sun Zhesheng will come north and travel with him is his business and he does not know. In short, this trip has no political connection. Visiting Pingjin is only to observe the social situation there, and observing the Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues in Pingjin is more intimate. This is the purpose of his trip to North China. He also heard that Ding County, Baoding Road, formerly Zhili Province, has the best civilian education in the country, so he plans to take the opportunity to visit. As for the Rehe area, the roads are blocked and he may not go there. Whether he goes to Changli near Linyu will be decided after he arrives in Pingjin, depending on the needs. As for the rumors of a Russo-Japanese alliance and Russia recognizing the puppet state, in his personal opinion, this is unlikely and is just propaganda from the other side. The purpose of Soviet Russia is to overthrow imperialism and support weak nations. China, geographically speaking, is vast and rich in resources, but diplomatically, its national power is in the weakest position. If Soviet Russia cannot overthrow imperialism or support weak nations, and instead helps imperialism to insult China, it would be contrary to its principles. He does not think that Soviet Russia would do this, but diplomacy is unpredictable and cannot be judged by one example.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the League to Abolish Civil War</h3>

Here is a continuation of the association's telegraphic communications from yesterday:</p>
<p>Telegram from Zhang Boling. Tianjin, sent at 10:00 AM on September 22, reads: To the League to Abolish Civil War, I have received the telegram. I will depart for Shandong. I will leave the day after tomorrow. Sincerely, Boling.</p>

<h3>The National Disaster Relief Team Begins Fundraising</h3>
<p>Initiated by He Xiangning and Others</p>
<p>The Northeastern Volunteer Army is fighting a life-and-death battle with Japanese imperialism in the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. Their sacrifice and bloodshed for the Chinese nation command the respect of the people. However, transportation in various parts of the Northeast is inconvenient, the volunteer army's pay is insufficient, and equipment is difficult to complete, resulting in wounds everywhere and a lack of rescue workers. He Xiangning, Liu Yazi, Guo Qiyuan, and others, in view of this, have gathered comrades to organize a rescue team to go to the Northeast and provide rescue separately. The necessary funds were initially provided by Ms. He privately raising more than 5,000 yuan. Now, the work is tense and cannot be completed for a while. It is difficult to proceed without raising large sums of money in advance. Therefore, the meeting decided to raise donations from home and abroad. It is reported that fundraising has already begun within the day.</p>
<h3>Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang</h3>
<p>A Collection of Telegrams from the People's Support Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association received a telegram from the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, which reads: The Northeast Volunteer Army, Fifth Military Region Headquarters, document (12) telegraph says that on the 19th of last month, Liu Zhenyu and Xie Guochen's troops jointly attacked Tongliao, fighting fiercely for more than ten hours, killing 35 Japanese officers and more than 30 Mongolian traitors. Our army suffered six wounded soldiers. The Kaifeng-Tucheng has been occupied by the 17th Route Army Commander Li Fangting. Taonan will be taken soon. The Zheng-Tao line of communication has now been cut off and an attack is planned. The 15th Route Fei Bingyi department of the First Military Region recovered Zhangwu on the 16th. Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Propaganda Department, Hao Yin.</p>
<p>Another telegram says: (1) The Jilin Volunteer Army, led by Feng Zhanhai, and the National Salvation Army, led by Wang Delin, have joined forces several times to attack Jilin. The Jidun and Jihai lines have been cut off. The invading bandits are surrounded and attacked on all sides, are exhausted, and have retreated to isolated cities. Our volunteer army is responding everywhere, and traffic in and out of the city has been cut off. (2) According to Japanese news, the Fushun Coal Mine, the Donglang Coal Mine, and the Laohuzi Coal Mines were attacked by 2,000 Big Sword Society members at 0:30 this morning. The company's housing and miners' dormitories were burned. Watanabe, the director of the mine, and seven other Japanese were killed. They retreated at 4:00 PM. (3) Yesterday, Mr. Tang Zuofu, a member of the Rehe Provincial Government, talked about the front line reports. The Japanese are very busy arranging military affairs, but our defenses are solid and hopefully there will be no worries. (4) The Japanese army is stepping up security because our volunteer army will launch a general attack on Shenyang on September 18. They dispatched 20 aircraft to demonstrate in the air and ordered farmers in the four suburbs of Shenyang to cut down the sorghum stems. (5) The Shanghai Students' Volunteer Army Northeast Volunteer Group arrived in Pingjin a few days ago and temporarily resided in Feng Da's First Dormitory. Twenty-five team members left the pass yesterday (the 16th) to participate in a volunteer army unit and go to the front to fight. (6) A person from Suizhong said that the Volunteer Army Commander Sun Guoru, after breaking away from the Fourth Route National Salvation Army, formed a group of 700 comrades and stationed them in the wasteland of Wanjia Village to step up training and enhance their reputation. Suddenly, the Japanese army learned about it and dispatched more than 300 Japanese soldiers to suppress it. Our volunteer army temporarily retreated for strategic reasons. When the Japanese army came later, our volunteer army fought from the mountains in the old and young trenches of Wanjia Village. As a result, the Japanese army could not resist and retreated. It is estimated that many enemies were killed in the battle, and seven rifles were captured. We only had 12 wounded soldiers, Lan Yinqiao.</p>
<p>Another telegram says: According to Wu Lei Yuan, who returned to Ping from Beipiao on September 15, his face-to-face report on the front situation is very detailed and is specifically forwarded as follows: (1) When Wu arrived at Taohua Tu for inspection, according to Xu Xike, the chief of staff of Liu Zhenzhou's unit, at 3:00 PM on August 19, the Japanese invaders used two armored vehicles, carrying four mortars, four machine guns, and more than 100 soldiers to occupy Beipiao. They were met head-on by the 12th Company of the Beipiao garrison. The Japanese army could not resist and retreated. Our army contacted the volunteer armies and destroyed the Chaoyang Temple to Liuhe Railway to cut off the enemy's retreat route. At dawn, more than 100 of our troops contacted the enemy at Jinjia Village, killing 13 enemy soldiers. (According to the Yi County secret agent), over 20 were injured. Our army had two injuries. The enemy then retreated under the cover of aircraft. (2) On August 17, our army captured a Japanese national named Ishimoto Kenjiro, a commissioned official of the Kwantung Army Headquarters and a liaison officer stationed in Rehe, Beipiao. He is still in custody. On August 19, a section of the Chaoyang Temple-Liuhe Railway was destroyed (seven or eight feet long) and more than 10 Japanese soldiers were killed. (3) The Chaoyang Temple Zhoujiatun station in Yi County is surrounded by our army and it will not be difficult to capture it within a few days. According to Wu's plan, more than 100 plainclothes team members were sent to the rear to disrupt and destroy transportation. At the same time, a large-scale attack would be launched, and the two locations could be taken down in one fell swoop. The above are all the real situations, and I report them to you. Lan Yinqiao.</p>
<h3>The Eighth Division Collects Funds to Help the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>More Than 1,300 Yuan Remitted by the Bank of China</p>
<p>The Loyalty to the Country Has Never Been Forgotten</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter from the command of the Eighth Division of the National Army, stating that the division's staff, Ouyang Jing, and others, together with the commander Mao Bingwen, initiated a fund-raising campaign in the army. The full amount has now been collected and is being remitted to the association by the Bank of China for forwarding to the Volunteer Army outside the pass. The text of the letter is as follows: Eighth Division: We are heartbroken by the national crisis and have no tears to shed. We are confined to Jiangxi and responsible for bandit suppression work and cannot throw our flesh bombs towards Yuguan Northeast. Every time we read reports of the arduous struggle of the volunteer army in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, we cannot help but be filled with admiration and tears. A few days ago, we learned from the newspapers that you had initiated a donation to the volunteer army, so we immediately turned to the officers of our division at all levels to solicit donations to provide some help. Fortunately, all comrades enthusiastically contributed, and in a few days, a total of 1,305 yuan was donated. Although at this time, our pay is extremely tight and supplies are often unsustainable, we were inspired by our conscience and were willing to save on clothing and food to support the volunteer army. It can be seen that the loyalty of all comrades in this division has never been forgotten. In addition to the donation that has been remitted to the Bank of China, we have attached a donation book and request that you check it, publish it in the newspapers on our behalf, and reply to us. Sincerely, Ouyang Jing, Peng Zanyu, Zhou Kang, Zeng Keyi, Tao Jin, jointly sent (from the Jiangxi military camp).</p>
<p>The Origins of the Fundraising. The army also attached a donation book, with an introduction written by Mao Bingwen, commander of the Eighth Division: It has been almost a year since the Japanese occupied the three northeastern provinces. Those responsible for defending the territory have always adhered to the policy of non-resistance. Only the Northeastern Volunteer Army is fighting alone there. This time, Shanghai celebrities Huang Yanpei, Wang Xiaoyu, etc., were outraged and organized the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association to initiate fundraising for aid. I think that all compatriots with blood and energy already sympathize, especially us armed comrades who have a responsibility to defend the country, and of course we fully support it. We are now suppressing bandits here and cannot go to the Northeast to support the hard-fought volunteer army. Please save some money on cigarettes and food to provide them with a few bullets and fulfill our conscience's responsibility. Initiators: Ouyang Jing, Zhou Kang, Tao Jin, Zeng Keyi. Recipient: Ouyang Jing, Peng Zan. (List of donors omitted)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army Heads North to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Now Arrived in Shanghai, Departing Soon</p>
<p>Jiang Zihang, etc., of the Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army of the 61st Division of the 19th Route Army, who participated in the Songhu Resistance Against Japan, declared: The violent Japanese, relying on their East Asia continental policy and using their sharp artillery as a vanguard, invaded and occupied Liaoning in the "September 18th Incident" last year, and attacked our Songhu again in the "January 28th Incident" this spring. Although our army fiercely fought back in the Songhu battle, inflicting significant losses on the enemy, the enemy had no choice but to agree to a settlement and reluctantly retreated north after losing their troops. However, the strong neighboring Japanese bandits have not only persisted in their wickedness but have also intensified their actions. They have now transferred troops from Songhu, exerting all their efforts to coerce our Northeast Volunteer Army, attempting to support puppets to achieve their final goal of the Manchurian policy. Simultaneously, they are attacking Rehe and disturbing the peace in Beiping and Tianjin to confuse world opinion and counter our government's policies. At a time when the Volunteer Army is rising one after another, and war clouds are gathering densely over Rehe, with the situation becoming critical, we, who have witnessed aircraft and endured heavy bombing in Songhu, and have heard the sounds of fierce artillery fire and shouts of battle, have long understood the enemy's magic weapons and their true capabilities. How can soldiers stand idly by, sheathing their flags and silencing their drums, while the enemy secretly exploits and oppresses? How can we sit idly by and watch Rehe fall like the second Shenyang? And how can we turn a deaf ear to the cries of suffering from our Northeastern compatriots and the mournful sounds of anti-Japanese martyrs? If we, the Chinese nation, want to survive, recover lost territories, and avenge our shame, we must fight desperately, strive to the death, and resist to the end. The Northeast Volunteer Army is hoping to increase the front line, add infantry, and prepare for a counterattack, while the Rehe front urgently needs support to mount a fierce resistance. In this tense situation, we anti-Japanese soldiers have only our bodies and lives to intensify the anti-Japanese movement and continue our efforts, engaging in a life-and-death struggle with the enemy. Now, Jiang Zihang and others vow to use their blood and heads and are determined to head north to aid Rehe, or go beyond the border and join the Northeast Volunteer Army, sharing the mission of resisting Japan and saving the country, fighting together. This is our declaration. Former Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army of the 61st Division of the 19th Route Army: Jiang Zihang, Huang Haishu, Chen Dingzhong, Shi Damin, Du Jingxiong, Cai Shaochu.</p>
<h3>Liaoning Volunteer Army Representative Yang Yijie Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

After arriving in Nanjing on the 6th, Xu Jinyai came to Shanghai to prepare for the establishment of a liaison office. Yang Yijie and others stayed in Nanjing to report to the Central National Government Military Council on the Route's anti-Japanese bloody battles and request ammunition replenishment. Having completed his official duties in Nanjing, he arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 22nd) from Nanjing and is staying at the Andong Hotel.</p>

<h3>Mr. Ge</h3>
<p>Donates to Aid Northeastern Refugees</p>
<p>Mr. Ge Bocic and his wife are inherently charitable. Recently, seeing that the weather is gradually getting colder and the Northeastern refugees are suffering terribly, with hundreds of thousands homeless, they specially donated 100 yuan to the Northeastern Refugee Relief Association of the Guangzhao Public Hall on Ningji Road, and obtained a formal receipt. Although this is just a drop in the bucket, it is hoped that everyone will follow Mr. Ge's example, so that Northeastern refugees will not suffer from hunger and homelessness.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Chen Wulie Returns to China</h3>
<p>To Observe the New Initiatives of the Motherland</p>
<p>To Investigate the Industries of Various Provinces</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Wulie is a giant among the prominent overseas Chinese gentlemen and merchants of British Singapore in Southeast Asia. His ancestors first engaged in business in Siam, and made special contributions to that country. The overseas Chinese currently residing in Siam, numbering about six million, are all due to Chen Wulie's guidance and planning. Recently, during the coup in Siam, Chen Wulie was also one of the key figures. Therefore, the Kingdom of Siam has conferred the title of nobility on the Chen family, and Mr. Wulie is now the sixth generation to hold it. Although Mr. Chen grew up overseas, his enthusiasm for protecting his motherland is no less than that of his compatriots in the country. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen first went overseas and promoted the revolution, Mr. Chen joined the Tongmenghui, advocating for those who grew up overseas and secretly providing financial support. Therefore, he was highly regarded by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. All the senior comrades also respected and loved him. It is heard that Mr. Chen is one of the founders of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation. This time, he returned to China to observe the new initiatives of the motherland and investigate the industries of various provinces, as well as to visit senior comrades.</p>

<h3>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Hires Xie Zhongfu as an Advisor</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese businessman Mr. Xie Zhonghou is an advanced revolutionary and the young son of Mr. Xie Fuchu. He has always been extremely enthusiastic about overseas Chinese affairs. Since returning to China from overseas, he has founded many industrial and commercial enterprises. Recently, seeing that the national crisis is deepening and that the fundamental plan for saving the country is to develop industry, he wishes to go to Southeast Asia to persuade wealthy overseas Chinese compatriots to return to China to invest and establish industries. Chen Shuren, the chairman of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, has specially hired him as an advisor to the commission, asking Mr. Xie to assist in all matters. It is heard that the letter of appointment has been brought to Shanghai by Chu Minyi, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. Mr. Xie accepted it and will make contributions to overseas Chinese affairs.</p>
<h3>German Aviator Still Not Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Received Telegram in This City to Arrive Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>German aviator Captain Wolfgang von Gronau, along with three assistants, was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Japan aboard the Dornier Wal flying boat. It is now learned that due to bad weather yesterday, they still could not arrive in port. Yesterday afternoon, Captain Fowler (Bpt. Fowles), the person in charge of the Shanghai Aviation Association, telegraphed Japan to inquire. He received a reply in the afternoon, stating that they would arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd or 24th (i.e., today or tomorrow). Therefore, the banquet originally scheduled to be held on the roof of the HSBC Bank last night has also been postponed until after their arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to the latest telegram, German aviator Captain Wolfgang von Gronau, who is circumnavigating the world, will not arrive in Shanghai until today or tomorrow. The China Aviation Construction Association, together with China and Eurasia Aviation Corporations, will host a banquet to welcome Mr. Gronau the day after he arrives in Shanghai and has invited Liu Yifu, Wang Zhiyuan, Yin Zhiling, Zhu Lin, Ling Xianyang, and others to be on the preparatory committee.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhennan</h3>
<p>Concurrently Heads the Hydrographic Survey Bureau</p>
<p>Wu Guangzong's Coffin Sealed Yesterday</p>
<p>Wu Guangzong, the Director of the Hydrographic Survey Bureau, was assassinated. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. After Director Wu was assassinated, the bureau telegraphed the Ministry of Navy to report and request instructions. Yesterday, they received a telegram from the Ministry of Navy expressing great shock and grief over Wu's assassination. They have followed the Ministry of Navy's regulations for preferential compensation. Considering that the Hydrographic Survey Bureau cannot be without a person in charge for even a day, they immediately telegraphed to appoint Wu Zhennan, the Director of the Coastal Patrol Office, to concurrently head the bureau. After receiving the order, Mr. Wu arrived at the bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday to take over. The Ministry of Navy has also requested the Shanghai Municipal Government to strictly investigate and arrest the fugitive murderer to comfort the spirit of the deceased. Wu's body was sealed in a coffin at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 6:00 PM yesterday, and people from all walks of life came to pay their respects in an endless stream.</p>
<h3>Jiang Yuji Warehouse</h3>
<p>Blocked by the French Municipal Council</p>
<p>Requesting the Municipal Government to Negotiate Based on Reason</p>
<p>The Land Belongs to Chinese Private Property</p>
<p>The Council Has No Right to Collect Land Tax</p>
<p>Jiang Changlin of Jiang Yuji Construction Factory is requesting the Municipal Government to negotiate with the French Municipal Council based on reason, in order to maintain national rights, due to the Council's collection of land tax on a private land lot. The petition states: "The petition is regarding the French Concession Municipal Council's forceful blocking of a warehouse due to unsuccessful land tax collection, which not only damages our national sovereignty but also infringes on the legal rights of the people. We urge you to quickly negotiate according to the law to maintain national rights and the livelihood of the people. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, I rented a piece of private land owned by Chen Genfa and others at 223 Rue Ratard in the French Concession, measuring three mu, on which several bungalows were built for temporary use as a warehouse and workshop. We lived peacefully for many years. Unexpectedly, in August of this year, the French Concession Municipal Council suddenly ordered us to pay a land tax of 258 taels and 9 qian of silver. We reasoned that the land was private property and there was no obligation to pay the tax, and rejected their demand. On the morning of September 20th of this year, the Council sent people to forcefully block all entrances of the land with wire mesh, preventing entry and exit and detaining workers inside, disregarding the people's right to freedom of residence under the law. The nature of concessions and leased territories is absolutely different. The establishment of concessions only designates certain areas where foreigners are allowed to rent land, set up shops, and reside. Therefore, apart from the land leased to foreigners with title deeds, private land in the concession and its road areas is not subject to land tax according to law and custom. Originally, private land belongs to Chinese private property and still pays national taxes and surtaxes. It has not been leased to foreigners for use. According to law, the Council has no right to collect land tax. Even if it must be paid, it should be collected directly from the landowner, and there is no reason to collect it from the lessee. Now, the Council is violating the treaty, breaking the convention, illegally levying taxes, and without going through legal procedures to file a lawsuit in court, it has forcefully blocked the warehouse. It is essentially trying to coerce the people into performing an obligation they do not have. Damaging the legal rights of individuals is a small matter, but violating the treaty and damaging our national sovereignty is a major matter. Moreover, more than ten workers are detained inside, and their lives are at risk, which is completely inhumane. Regarding the reasons for the private land being blocked by the French Concession Municipal Council, I hereby submit this document to your government, requesting you to quickly negotiate based on reason in order to maintain national rights and the livelihood of the people. This will be both beneficial to the public and to personal virtue. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>
<h3>Villages Encircled by the Railway</h3>
<p>Villagers Petition the Railway Bureau to Make Concessions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways is building a joint transportation hub for two railways in the Zhenru and Pengpu areas. More than ten villages north of Jiaotong Road, including Wangjiajing, Zhuxiang, and Zhangjiazhaizhai, petitioned the Two-Railway Administration yesterday for relief. The petition states: "The petition is regarding the villages encircled by the Ministry of Railways' construction of a joint transportation hub, requesting relief and praying that the Ministry of Railways will approve concessions in order to alleviate the people's livelihood and secure the neighborhood. The Ministry of Railways is encircling land in the Zhenru and Pengpu areas west of Zhongshan Road to build a joint transportation hub for two railways, which is originally intended to revitalize Shanghai and facilitate national transportation, which we support. However, observing the recent surveying and demarcation by the Ministry of Railways and your Bureau, more than twenty villages are encircled, especially in the area north of Jiaotong Road of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, including Wangjiajing, Zhangjiazhaizhai, Zhuxiang, Wangjiazhaizhai, and Gujiazhaizhai, which is even more unreasonable. Upon hearing this, we felt as if struck by lightning and were extremely frightened. We are deeply concerned that our livelihood will be cut off from now on. We are forced to present the following information and appeal for relief, hoping you will investigate. Food, clothing, and shelter are the three major necessities of life. We have lived in our villages for generations, farming for a living. Our daily livelihood depends entirely on agricultural produce. Now that our farmland has been bought up and our production tools have disappeared, and our villages, which provide shelter from the cold, are being encircled, we cannot live and work in peace to maintain our remaining lives after the disaster. We are poor families, and farming is our lifelong career. Changing to industry and commerce halfway through is not feasible. Now that we cannot farm and cannot live, it is no different from putting us to death. Transportation construction is important, but the people's livelihood is even more important. This is the first reason why we should request relief and seek concessions. Although the Ministry of Railways has provided compensation for the land it bought, and relocation fees for the villages it encircled, the land price in the vicinity will inevitably skyrocket due to the convenience of transportation. Therefore, the compensation provided will definitely not be enough to buy the same land again, and the relocation fees will definitely not be enough to build again. The farmers' hard-earned income over the years is only enough to make ends meet, and there are no savings for relocation. Moreover, villages and farming are closely related. Farmers live and farm in the same place. If there is any land left after the encirclement, it will be difficult to move far away for work and give up our business. Moreover, rural house building has its own geographical customs and cannot be built anywhere like in the city. Therefore, since we cannot live nearby and cannot move far away, our future lives will be miserable. This is the second reason why we should request relief and seek concessions. The railway encircles a vast area of more than 4,000 mu, while the section north of Jiaotong Road, from Gujiazhaizhai to Zhongshan Road, is only a hundred mu, yet more than ten villages are affected, and more than three hundred farming households are persecuted. The annual production loss is more than a million. The land price of the villages encircled by us along Jiaotong Road is several times higher than that of the area south of the road, which is not cost-effective for the Ministry of Railways to buy. The farmers' stable farming will lose its foundation. Your Bureau has repeatedly stated that the land needed is at most five or six hundred mu, but now the land encircled is so vast, it is inevitable that the outside world will suspect that it has other purposes, and public opinion is boiling. Therefore, if we can narrow the scope, it will be beneficial to both reason and benefit. This is the third reason why we should request relief and seek concessions. The Ministry of Railways' construction of a joint station is imperative, but it can be expected that it can understand the people's sufferings. We hereby submit this document, requesting your leadership to review, provide relief, and quickly forward it to the Ministry of Railways regarding the villages north of Jiaotong Road, please grant concessions in order to alleviate the people's livelihood and secure the neighborhood. This is a virtuous deed. "</p>

<h3>Record of the Trial of the Russian Beggar's Appeal Case</h3>
<p>Postponed for Continued Hearing</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Russian beggar, George Chiladi, who died in the Second Special District Court Detention Center on June 19th of this year, the Second Special District Court held a hearing and re-examined the body. The result confirmed that the death was due to illness. The court acquitted Xu Zongwen, the director of the detention center, and Yu Minggao, the medical officer. The charge of abandonment leading to death against guard Zhou Zongxiang was dismissed. Subsequently, the French Concession Police Department expressed dissatisfaction with the first instance judgment and filed an appeal. The original court, based on the statement, submitted the case file to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for review. This information was previously reported. It is now known that the Police Department's grounds for appeal are divided into procedural and factual points, amounting to thousands of words. The Third High Court scheduled a hearing for yesterday afternoon. Summonses were issued in advance, and the police notified the defendants Zhou Zongxiang, Xu Chongwen, Yu Minggao, the deceased's family member Simon Glaitzki, and witnesses Russian nationals Kezhun Skov, Vladimir Koroku Chuji, Konstanz Ding Qibo Dalaifu, Chinese detention center medicine director Li Dianzhong, and Russian translator Cao Jianhou to appear in court for the hearing. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the summoned individuals arrived at the court to await instructions. At 3 PM, the criminal court president Guo Dezhang, along with judges Fan Peien and Zhao Zhenhai, together with Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shizhuang and Russian translator Zhang Qingchun, opened the Third Criminal Court for the hearing. The Police Department was still represented by lawyer Fei Xizhen, and French legal advisor Dugue (transliteration) also attended the hearing. The defense lawyers hired by the defendants, Li Shirui and Liu Shixiong, also arrived at the court. The official first summoned the defendants Zhou Zongxiang, Xu Chongwen, and Yu Minggao to the stand, questioned their age, origin, and occupation. Then, the plaintiff was ordered to state the grounds for appeal. Lawyer Fei, representing the Police Department, stated that the Police Department was dissatisfied with the original judgment in the first instance and filed an appeal based on two points. The first point concerned procedure. The Police Department initially charged Zhou Zongxiang with assault according to the criminal procedure law. After the investigation of evidence was completed, the charge was changed to abandonment leading to death. The original judgment dismissed the charge of abandonment leading to death against Zhou, considering that this judgment could only be applied to cases prosecuted by the prosecutor's office and not to cases prosecuted by the administrative authorities according to the agreement. This is because the prosecutor's office has ample time for investigation, while the Police Department is often constrained by time and cannot conduct a thorough investigation. The second point concerned facts. The statements made by Xu Chongwen and Yu Minggao during the Police Department's investigation and the testimonies in the first instance court were contradictory before and after, which were inconsistent with the testimonies of the three Russian witnesses. The original judgment of innocence was unconvincing. Therefore, the appeal was filed, requesting that the original judgment be overturned and an appropriate judgment be made. It was also stated that the Police Department had a crucial point before the opening of the debate, requesting that the cause of death of the deceased be examined by British and French doctors together with the forensic doctor of the Second Special District Court, and requested that the doctors be summoned to court for questioning next time to clarify the cause of death. At this point, the official questioned the defendants Zhou, Xu, Yu, the family of the deceased, the three Russian witnesses, and the two Chinese witnesses one by one in detail (the statements were generally the same as the statements in the first instance, and the length is not repeated here). As a result, the court announced a postponement for a continued hearing. When the court adjourned, the clock struck nine.</p>
<h3>Gunshots on Avenue Edward VII</h3>
<p>A Young Man Shot and Wounded</p>
<p>Two Assailants, One Escaped, One Captured</p>
<p>At 10:02 last night, a gunshot suddenly occurred at the entrance of the Sino-French Clock Shop No. 523, at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Massenet in the French Concession. Bystanders witnessed a young man in a dark blue long gown fall to the ground. There were many pedestrians at the time, and they scattered like birds and beasts upon hearing the gunshot. The young man slowly got up, pressed his hand on his thigh, and staggered onto a rickshaw, heading towards the West Gate Bridge. There were two assailants, who both fled south along Rue Massenet. No. 221, standing at the corner, drew his gun and chased after the assailants. A short, stocky figure in an ant-cloth shirt and trousers first escaped through Zhizhong Lane, while the assailant with the gun frantically fled into the Xieyichun Congee Shop at No. 120, intending to escape through the back door. Unexpectedly, the owner of the shop had locked the back door a week ago due to frequent pedestrian traffic, which caused inconvenience. The assailant, finding no way out, crouched near the staircase. Chinese policeman No. 221 also followed him into the shop and hid next to a pile of taro sacks, firing four shots at the assailant. In desperation, the assailant lunged at the policeman, and the two wrestled for about five minutes. Finally, with the help of the congee shop's staff, the assailant was subdued. At this time, the assailant had already been hit by several bullets and was taken to the Grand Central Police Station, but he was unable to speak and was feared to be in critical condition. The young man who was shot by the assailant was accompanied by a friend to the Country Hospital on Rue Bourgeat. The doctor, upon seeing that it was a gunshot wound, immediately reported it to the police station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate. It was said that his name was Ma Er, a native of Ningbo, and lived at No. 15 Chunjiang Lane, Lujiazui, Pudong. He came to Puxi for sightseeing today (yesterday) and unexpectedly encountered Xiaohulang (the assailant), whom he knew, a person who made a living by robbing opium. Xiaohulang, upon seeing him, immediately asked where he could find a large quantity of opium and ordered him to give him a lead. He immediately replied that he did not know where to find opium. Xiaohulang became angry and immediately drew a handgun and shot him. The bullet pierced his left hand and went straight into his chest. However, whether this was the truth, the police are still investigating.</p>
<h3>New Haizhou Port</h3>
<p>Xugou Successful Trial Voyage</p>
<p>Dapu Port to be Abandoned</p>
<p>Since the opening of Haizhou, Dapu Port has been the focal point for merchant ships. Goods arriving via the Longhai Railway are unloaded there and transshipped to Shanghai. In the past, goods from the Northwest were transshipped from the Yangtze River and Xuzhou, but now they are shipped from Haizhou. However, the Dapu Port coastline is constantly changing due to the impact of sand and tides, and the accumulation of silt has become abnormal in recent years, making navigation difficult. The Longhai Railway Bureau has changed its location to Xugou, where construction has been completed. The following is a detailed account of the reporter's investigation.</p>
<p>Dapu Shallow Water Makes Navigation Difficult: Dapu is the water and land transport port of Haizhou. Various shipping companies in Shanghai, such as China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Da Zhen Company, and He Zhong Company, have built wharves and warehouses there. The Longhai Railway also connects to a branch line, allowing merchant ships and trains to connect, making loading and unloading goods very convenient. However, since last year, the accumulation of sand and silt in Dapu Port of Haizhou has increased, making navigation extremely difficult. At shallow water, the smallest is only five feet deep. This year, Shanghai ships have often been stranded in Dapu, resulting in inability to transport many goods, reducing the load by 30% to 40% each time. Slightly more loading will prevent ships from entering the port, requiring transshipment by barges, which is extremely inconvenient.</p>
<p>New Xugou Port Built: Xugou is about 40 miles northwest of Dapu. The port is ice-free all year round and has extremely deep water. Even at low tide, it is over 30 feet deep, making it a natural harbor for Haizhou. In the past, the Longhai Railway Bureau hired German engineers to design and develop it. The estimated construction cost of the new port was at least 20 million yuan. Last year, Director Qian, seeing the difficulty of navigation in Dapu, began to simplify construction and development of Xugou Port. The breakwater was built first, and the Longhai Railway branch line was connected this year. A warehouse and customs office were also built. By this month, the various projects have been roughly completed, and the remaining projects will be added successively.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Sends Ships for Trial Run: On the day of completion of the Xugou Port shore, the Longhai Railway Bureau intended to abandon Dapu Port, and merchant ships from all over the country will change to the new port and connect with the Railway Bureau. The loading and unloading of goods will be changed to Xugou. On the 12th of this month, the Longhai Railway Bureau tested the navigation channel of the new port. The material section sent a merchant ship with a load of 3,000 tons, carrying various materials and supplies from the Longhai Railway, from outside Dapu Port to Xugou. The draft of the ship was about 17 feet. It was ordered to enter the new port for trial voyage. The trial voyage was very satisfactory, and there was no obstruction in the port. However, the wharf was not completed, so it could not dock alongside the shore and was temporarily loaded and unloaded with barges. The Railway Bureau has notified various companies that heavy-loaded ships can go to the new port for loading and unloading. Once the shore embankment project is completed, Dapu Port will be completely changed to Xugou.</p>
<h3>Sino-Dutch Light Bulb Negotiations</h3>
<p>Hu Xiyuan Goes to Beijing to Present Manufacturing Methods</p>
<p>The light bulbs produced by the China Appler Electric Factory's light bulb department were groundlessly rejected by Dutch merchants in the Dutch East Indies, having a huge impact on the overseas trade of all Chinese goods. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry of our government attach great importance to this matter, and the public is also extremely indignant. The various situations have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Now, after serious negotiations with the Netherlands by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they have shown slight concessions, but trade freedom has not been completely resolved. Therefore, our side still needs to continue negotiations. Regarding the glass tube air extraction method patented by Dutch merchants, the Appler factory's foreign and industrial departments have slightly explained in the report. However, due to the complexity of light bulb manufacturing, written explanations are often not easy to understand. Hu Xiyuan, the general manager of the factory, specially took the special express train to Beijing today, carrying detailed drawings of light bulb manufacturing, to meet with the authorities in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry, and to explain the various light bulb manufacturing methods and the principle of glass tube air extraction, so that the government can understand the content and it will be easier to start negotiations.</p>
<h3>Songshang Chamber of Commerce Requests Demolition of the Old Yunzaobang Bridge</h3>
<p>The Wusong Chamber of Commerce recently stated that the old Yunzaobang Bridge has become dilapidated after the war. Although the two ends of the bridge are blocked by lead wires, there are still pedestrians who ignore the danger and cross the bridge. In addition, several sections of the middle bridge pier have been broken and the bridge surface is inclined. There are many ships traveling along the canal, which also obstructs water traffic. If it is not demolished, a tragedy will occur in the future. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the Public Works Bureau be asked to demolish the bridge as soon as possible to avoid danger and benefit transportation.</p>
<h3>Road Association Teams Seek Progress</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the China National Road Construction Association, the staff of each team have worked very hard. As of yesterday afternoon, the scores received by each team (with one yuan as one point) are as follows: Honorary Captain Zhu Qingrun 200 points, Sichuan Team Honorary Captain Zhang Peinian 400 points, Huqiu Mountain Team Captain Dong Chi 200 points, Guangxi Team Captain Yan Zhifang 200 points, Rehe Team Captain Tao Guilin 400 points, Xinjiang Team Captain Bai Wenwei 200 points, and others such as Luofu Mountain Team Captain Xian Guansheng, Yalu River Team Captain Zhang Weicheng, Jiangxi Team Captain Luo Qinghua, Jiuhua Mountain Team Captain Xu Xiuzhi, Shanxi Team Captain Xue Dubi, Yunnan Team Captain Zhu Shaoping, Suiyuan Team Captain Yang Dunfu, etc., submitted more than 1,700 points. There are still several teams that are being organized.</p>
<h3>County District Chiefs</h3>
<p>Request Extension of Land Value Tax Deadline</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai County government treasury began collecting the first installment of the 21st year land value tax (i.e., summer and autumn silver), the two-month deadline is approaching, and overdue payments will incur late payment penalties. Now, the Shanghai County government, according to the reports from the fifth district chief and others, states that the economy of the farmers in the various villages is generally difficult, and they cannot pay the national tax on time. The report requested that the government consider the hardships of the people and approve an extension of the summer and autumn silver deadline by one month, etc. After receiving the report, the county government, considering it concerns the national tax, ordered the finance bureau yesterday to review and reply.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Private Electric Power Industry Association</h3>
<p>Requests Return of the Guangzhou Electric Power Company</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Municipal Government took over the privately-owned electric power company and made it government-run. The Jiangsu Provincial Private Electric Power Industry Association believes that industry colleagues should assist each other and strive to protect private operation and preserve the law, and sent the following telegram to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the Municipal Government of Guangzhou: (1) Respectful greetings to the Guangzhou Southwest Political Affairs Committee, having repeatedly read the news, it is surprising that the Guangzhou Electric Power Company was forcibly taken over by the Municipal Government. It is investigated that in August of the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Municipal Government sent personnel to jointly organize a reorganization committee with the company, which was a well-intentioned assistance. The original term was one year, and the National Private Electric Power Industry Association telegraphed the Guangzhou Provincial Government last year when the term expired, requesting that it be returned to commercial operation as scheduled. In November, the Guangzhou Provincial Government issued Order No. 146, stating that although the reorganization period has expired, the work has not been completed. It was resolved at the 17th meeting of the Provincial Government to continue the reorganization by the Municipal Government for a period of four months. It is investigated that the unfinished work during the reorganization period is limited to four months of continuation. Since it is said to be limited, then no matter what, it can be returned after four months. The wording is very clear, and the order is available, and there is no reason to justify reorganization and fulfill the ambition of seizing it. This is one thing that our association suspects and does not understand. It is investigated that the Central Political Conference in the 18th year, in order to explain the scope and meaning of the word "supervision" of public utilities and to clearly protect private electric power industry, when discussing the case in the 191st meeting, Liu Mayor and other committee members were recommended to review it, and it has been instructed by the National Government and promulgated by the Executive Yuan in Order No. 2956 to all ministries, committees, provinces and cities to comply. Also in February of the 19th year, the Construction Committee resolved to actively support the private electric power industry to ensure its full development, and Liu Mayor was also a member of the committee. Also at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th year, Jiang Zhongzheng, Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Dai Chuanxian and other committee members proposed that the sixth item of the plan to reform politics should severely condemn the confiscation of private electric power mines as inappropriate and should be corrected. It was resolved that private enterprises should be protected according to law. At that time, Liu Mayor was also a member of the committee. Regarding the above-mentioned cases, he personally participated in the discussions or reviews, and it is unlikely that his words and deeds would be contradictory. Whether he was instructed or misunderstood by those who do not understand the law, he should be clearly corrected. This is the second thing. It is investigated that Executive Yuan Order No. 2972 of the 18th year, which protects commercially-operated public utilities, stipulates in the first item that commercially-operated public utilities shall not be taken over before the expiration of the operating period, and that when taking over commercially-operated public utilities, the prescribed procedures shall be followed, and both parties shall agree and compensate at market price. It is also investigated that Article 14 of the Private Public Utility Supervision Regulations formulated by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government states that after 30 years of private public utilities, the supervisory authority may take them over for public operation after paying the price, but it must notify one year in advance. Article 15 of the same regulations states that when a private public utility is taken over for public operation, the existing assets shall be evaluated and paid. When the Municipal Government of Guangzhou took over the company, whether it was handled in accordance with the above-mentioned laws and regulations, it should be clearly announced. This is the third thing. In summary, based on the above-mentioned laws, we ask your committee to investigate and correct according to law, and to quickly return the Guangzhou Electric Power Company to commercial operation in order to respect the rule of law and follow public opinion. In a telephoned message, we are in urgent waiting for orders. Printed and sealed by the Jiangsu Provincial Private Electric Power Industry Association. (2) Respectful greetings to the Guangzhou Municipal Government, having repeatedly read the news (same as above). Evaluating and paying the various languages, when your Municipal Government takes over the company, whether it is handled in accordance with the above-mentioned laws and regulations, it should be clearly announced. This is the third thing. In summary, based on the above-mentioned laws, we ask your government to withdraw its order and quickly return the Guangzhou Electric Power Company to commercial operation in order to respect the rule of law and follow public opinion. In a telephoned message, we are in urgent waiting for orders. Printed and sealed by the Jiangsu Provincial Private Electric Power Industry Association.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County</h3>
<p>Building a Memorial Village in Miaohang</p>
<p>Original Houses Destroyed by Shelling</p>
<p>Refugees After Robbery Have No Place to Live</p>
<p>New Houses Completed Yesterday</p>
<p>The area of Dachang and Miaohang, which belongs to Baoshan County, was the center of intense shelling after the January 28th Incident. As a result, the residents, farmers, villages, and houses in the area were completely destroyed by the shelling. After the robbery, the refugees were displaced and lost their homes, which is very pitiful. The Baoshan County Military Disaster Relief Association, in view of the various tragic situations, has specially built a memorial village in the area. For every house originally owned by a refugee, one house will be allocated. For those who originally lived in two houses, two houses will be allocated, and so on. The houses were completed yesterday. There is a tall archway in front, with a memorial hall, a large auditorium, and other facilities. All the refugees have a place to live, which is a blessing for the local area. It is said that the construction funds were allocated by the provincial government to the association.</p>
<h3>Soybean and Rice Industry Has Not Resolved the Conflict Over Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association stated that in this year's autumn measure, because a certain grain shop and two rice shops violated the association's regulations, Yan Xiaoquan and Zhu Zixiang, two executive committee members, resigned from their positions as executive committee members after being insulted, and reported the situation of the shops that violated the regulations and seized the measure, requesting investigation and handling. After this incident, rice merchants in the north and south were greatly dissatisfied. The association had a meeting to discuss the matter and resolved to send the original letter of Yan and Zhu back to the members and persuade them not to resign. On the one hand, Chen Yuming and Qiang Zisheng, two executive committee members, were appointed to check the accounts of the three shops. After the investigation is completed, the association will convene all the merchants in the north and south to hold a special meeting to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>British Public Bus</h3>
<p>Workers Demand Resolution</p>
<p>The British Public Bus Company has accepted the workers' demands and agreed to raise salaries. The workers expressed satisfaction, and the strike ended.</p>
<p>Company Response: The company formally responded that, in response to ticket collectors, etc., after consultation between the traffic manager and the general manager, the salary level has been increased. From September 1, 1932, the salary of ticket collectors will be increased from 23 yuan to 25 yuan. To avoid ambiguity, it is further stated as follows: (1) The monthly salary of 25 yuan is calculated based on the daily work value. (2) Holiday pay, those who work 20 days will be given 2 days of holiday pay, and those who work 27 days will be given 3 days of holiday pay. If there are those who work the full month of 30 days, they will still be given holiday pay for the day. (3) Medical care, simple medicines are free. (4) The bonus standard has been changed. Those who serve earnestly and honestly every month have the hope of receiving a bonus of 12 yuan per month. (5) The pension (i.e., remuneration) regulations can be obtained from the traffic office. Each employee will deposit 5% of their salary with the company every month. Those who want to leave after serving for five years will be paid interest at 5% per annum, including principal and interest. Xiao Tuo, factory manager and traffic manager.</p>
<p>Workers Satisfied: At 5 AM yesterday morning, all the workers held a meeting on Connaught Road. Employee No. 24 reported that the company had responded to the workers' demands and asked everyone to discuss it. At that time, all the workers expressed satisfaction and immediately cancelled the strike committee, and the strike was resolved.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit of San You Factory's Labor-Management Dispute</h3>
<p>Labor Side Submits Statement of Defense</p>
<p>Stating Reasons and Filing Counterclaim</p>
<p>Regarding the labor-management dispute at the San You Industrial Society's main factory in Yinxiang Port, Shanghai, after the Shanghai Municipal Government's Arbitration Committee made a formal ruling, the management declared their dissatisfaction and filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court. On the afternoon of the 21st of this month at 2 PM, Judge Zhao Shulan, accompanied by Judges Wang Run and Wang Shicheng, presided over the hearing at the First Civil Court. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Here is the original text of the defendant's statement of defense:</p>
<p>Regarding the San You Industrial Society Co., Ltd.'s lawsuit seeking confirmation of the dismissal of the original workers at the Yinxiang Port factory, we submit this statement of defense and counterclaim (defense portion). Upon investigation, the San You Industrial Society was founded in the first year of the Republic of China (1912), with an initial capital of only 300 yuan. At that time, the workers' union assisted Shen Jiucheng and others in their diligent labor. Now, the plaintiff's capital has reached 2 million yuan, and Shen Jiucheng and others have become wealthy and achieved fame and success, largely due to the hard work of the workers' union members. Unexpectedly, after the Shanghai Incident (1932), Shen Jiucheng and others harbored ulterior motives, forgetting their roots and abandoning their origins. Therefore, they shut down the Yinxiang Port factory, intending to expel the workers who had helped build it in the past, leading to a painful hunger strike. Although the Mediation Committee proposed solutions and the Arbitration Committee made a ruling, Shen Jiucheng and others remained stubbornly obstinate, further oppressing the workers. They seem unaware that there is still justice in society and that there should be compassion among human beings. It is truly regrettable. Now, in order to vent their anger, the defendants have filed this lawsuit with the court. After carefully examining the complaint, its basic argument, in the final sections of each item, is nothing more than stating that after the implementation of the Factory Law, Article 5 of the contract dated March 14th of the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929) should be abolished, and Articles 27 to 30 of the Factory Law should be used as the basis for resolving this case. Therefore, whether Article 5 of the contract was revoked and invalidated upon the implementation of the Factory Law is the preliminary question in this case. Upon investigation, Article 5 is a clause agreed upon by both labor and management. It is stated in the Shanghai Labor-Management Mediation Committee's decision, which was signed by both parties, that the main text reads: "The ten conditions regarding treatment signed between the San You Industrial Society Workers' Union and the San You Industrial Society on March 14th of the 18th year of the Republic of China should be regarded as a labor contract" (full text of the conditions attached). Therefore, the provisions of Article 5 are a private contract, without any doubt. Once legally established, the rights and obligations under private law are binding. Unless it violates the law or the consent of the other party is obtained, one party cannot arbitrarily violate the contract. This is clearly explained in precedents No. 1035 and 1235 of the Third Year. Moreover, both parties have regarded the contract established in the 18th year as the standard for employment, and there has never been any abolition or change, which is verifiable and does not need to be fabricated. As for the so-called "handling matters in accordance with Items 2 to 8 of the Shanghai Special Municipality's Provisional Regulations for Retirement Benefits for Employees" in Article 5, it means handling matters in accordance with the Provisional Regulations. Because the Provisional Regulations stipulate the methods for employee retirement in detail and conform to the true intentions of both labor and management, it was agreed to adopt a portion of the Provisional Regulations as the standard for the relationship between the two parties, as a condition in the private contract. Whether the Provisional Regulations are permanently government laws or not is not within the scope of the contract between the two parties. However, the addendum at the end of the contract in the 18th year also states, "These conditions shall be implemented from the date of signing by both parties. (Addendum) Employees who are not members of the union shall not enjoy the same benefits. All clauses of these conditions that comply with government-promulgated measures shall be implemented in accordance with the amendments if the government amends them in the future." Therefore, if the Provisional Regulations are amended in the future, the amended portions may be changed. "Amended" means to revise the old ones. However, upon investigation, Items 2 to 8 of the Provisional Regulations have not been amended. Since they have not been amended, the addendum cannot be applied, and the original contract naturally enjoys full validity. As for whether the Provisional Regulations were abolished after the implementation of the Factory Law, the plaintiff should be responsible for providing evidence. Even if they were abolished, it is a matter of the new law taking precedence over the previous law. The Factory Law is not a law amending the Provisional Regulations, which is very clear. Moreover, after carefully examining the Factory Law, there are no provisions regarding employee retirement benefits. Therefore, the Factory Law is not the "amended measures" mentioned in the "Addendum," and there is no doubt. Now that the original contract is still valid, this is the first reason why the plaintiff's lawsuit is unreasonable. Furthermore, upon investigation, Items 6 and 8 of Article 5 stipulate that the employer must obtain approval from the Social Affairs Bureau before suspending or closing the business. Now, before obtaining approval from the Social Affairs Bureau, the plaintiff suspended and closed the business, which is a violation of the contract and should be regarded as the business not having been suspended or closed. Although the Shanghai Incident can be used as a reason for the employer to temporarily suspend operations, after the Shanghai Incident subsided, work should be resumed, which is reasonable. Looking at the factories in Shanghai, many have temporarily suspended operations and have now resumed work, which is countless. Now that the Yinxiang Port factory cannot be regarded as having been suspended or closed according to the contract (except for the short period during the Shanghai Incident), how can the plaintiff use this as a basis for dismissal? This is the second reason why the lawsuit is unreasonable. Upon investigation, Items 6 and 6 of Article 5 stipulate that employees should enjoy severance pay. Before the severance pay is issued, how can the plaintiff declare dismissal? This is the third reason why the lawsuit is unreasonable. Based on these three basic points, we earnestly request the court to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit and order them to bear the litigation costs. As for the Arbitration Committee's ruling, it was an arbitration based on circumstances and reason, with the primary purpose of settling disputes and calming people. There were many aspects that harmed the rights of the workers. However, if there is a glimmer of hope, the workers are willing to suffer losses to resolve this dispute. However, now the plaintiff Shen Jiucheng is wantonly attacking the fair ruling, blinded by greed and forgetting his conscience, to this extent, which is truly regrettable. After carefully examining the points he attacks, they have no substantial value in law, so there is no need to argue further. (Counterclaim portion) Since the contract of March 14th of the 18th year has full validity, and the plaintiff unilaterally violated it during this valid period, they should be held liable for compensation, which is obvious. However, calculating the amount of compensation will take time. It can be calculated and finalized within three or four days, and a formal statement will be submitted. We hereby make a preliminary statement, earnestly requesting your review and approval, which would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai District Court, Petitioner: Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Workers' Union, Attorney Wei Wenhan</p>

<h3>Enthusiasm for Promoting National Products in South China</h3>
<p>Report from the American Asiatic Factory's South China Exhibition Group</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the enthusiasm of Chinese people for using national products has been increasing day by day. Recently, various national products organizations have been engaged in national products movements in various places, and their work has been very intense. In particular, people in various ports in South China have shown extraordinary perseverance in promoting national products. According to Mr. Gao Shiheng of the American Asiatic Silk Weaving Factory, he left Shanghai on May 18th to investigate the silk industry situation in seven ports including Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and Ningbo. He also brought American Asiatic products and opened product exhibitions in each port. What was most exciting was that people in all ports paid close attention to national products. From provincial government members, county magistrates, and public security bureau chiefs to hawkers and porters, all voluntarily promoted national products. Customs exempted national products from taxes and inspections. Government offices, even during martial law, did not cause any difficulties for national products exhibitions. The general public especially welcomed and encouraged participation. Newspapers also promoted the event as much as possible. This kind of enthusiasm was not initially anticipated by people in Shanghai. Various ports are now studying various methods to promote national products and working tirelessly. Mr. Gao recently returned to Shanghai. Yesterday, Cai Shengbai, the general manager of the American Asiatic Silk Weaving Factory, hosted reporters from various newspapers to visit its warp and weft factory, seventh silk factory, and dyeing factory. During the banquet at 7 PM, Mr. Gao Shiheng reported in detail the course of the exhibition in South China. He also said that the factory spent 40,000 to 50,000 yuan on the exhibition in South China, with the sole purpose of promoting domestic products, which was deeply welcomed by people in various places. General Manager Cai also stated that the factory organization includes eleven silk factories, one warp and weft factory, dyeing factory, pattern factory, and iron factory. The warp and weft pattern machines are all self-made and self-dyed, using pure domestic silk to weave silk fabrics, with an annual output of 300,000 bolts, which are sold all over the world. The color of the printing and dyeing will never fade. In addition, the factory's printed double crepe is currently seeking names from all walks of life through newspaper advertisements, with a deadline of the 25th. Yan Duhe, Yu Kongwo, Zhou Shoujuan, Zhao Junhao, Huang Tianpeng, Gu Zifen, He Xiya, Guan Ji'an, Yao Sufeng, Zhang Ruogu, and other gentlemen have been invited to serve as judges, and the awards will be announced in the newspapers on October 10th.</p>
<h3>President of the High Court</h3>
<p>Lin Biao Comes to Shanghai to Inspect Detention Center</p>
<p>Lin Biao, President of the Jiangsu High Court, came to Shanghai yesterday on official business. In the morning, he went to the District Court, where President Shen and the chief prosecutor welcomed him for lunch. After lunch, President Lin inspected the detention center and then returned to his residence by car.</p>
<h3>Iron Plate Thrown, Killing a Small Worker</h3>
<p>The Longhua commercial vessel, which was moored at the No. 21 pontoon of the Yangshupu Customs, was unloading cargo at 9 PM the night before. Because there were several iron plates to be thrown into the ship's hold, the foreman called out to the workers in the hold to come out to avoid danger. The workers in the hold heard the call and hurried up the ladder. A small worker named Wang Xuetiao (49 years old, from Yangzhou) did not pay attention and remained in the hold. The workers outside did not know and threw the iron plate down. They only heard a cry, knowing that something had happened. They immediately went down into the hold and found that the worker's forehead and chest had been shattered by the iron plate, and his body was lying in a pool of blood, unconscious. The foreman, Chen Xiaosizi, immediately tried to move Wang ashore and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, due to his serious injuries, he died at 2 AM yesterday. At dawn, Hu Changqing and Xue Silin, the detectives of the Customs Water Police Station, transported the body to the Lifesaving Bureau for autopsy and reported it to the District Court for inspection. Subsequently, the prosecutor arrived for inspection and instructed the family to collect the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Mishearing the Words of a Taoist Priest</h3>
<p>Boatman Seeks Blessing but Suffers Misfortune</p>
<p>The Boatman Drowns</p>
<p>Chen Zhurong, a local, worked as a ferryman at the South Wharf. Recently, because his relative was sick, Chen mistakenly listened to the words of a sorcerer, saying that the patient's soul was lost at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. If he quickly went to call it back, he could save the life. Chen, as instructed, hired three Taoist priests, along with his younger brother and two friends, at 1:45 PM yesterday, rented boat No. 1658, and went to the wharf to summon the soul. Due to the rising tide, they hired a Hanyun small boat to tow it north. The boat was equipped with incense candles and paper ingots. The three Taoist priests wore Taoist robes along the way, chanting and bowing non-stop. Unexpectedly, when towed to the waters near the Nissin Company Wharf in Hongkou (not yet to the destination), the boat was suddenly impacted by the Hanyun small boat's engine, and suddenly capsized. The boatmen and passengers, a total of eight people, all fell into the water. The sailors of the small boat urgently rescued them. All seven passengers were rescued. The Taoist robes worn by the three Taoist priests were all wet, and they looked extremely embarrassed. The boatman, however, tragically drowned, and his body sank without a trace. Afterwards, Cao Hailin, the boss of the small boat, towed the original boat to the Customs Water Police Station and reported the situation. The police station did not know the name or age of the deceased, so they sent detective Sun Agui to investigate the relatives of the deceased and temporarily detained the boat at the police station for collection.</p>
<h3>Wife Commits Suicide Because Husband Wants to Take a Concubine</h3>
<p>A Tragic Scene in the Family</p>
<p>Wang Tan, a 27-year-old woman from Henan, lived at No. 9 Chenghe Lane, Saposai Road, French Concession. Her husband, Wang Fulin, 30 years old, worked in the military. Because he was already thirty years old but had no children, he was quite concerned and wanted to take a concubine. He discussed this with his wife, Tan. After hearing this, she began to quarrel, followed by a physical fight. At around 11 PM the night before, she suddenly had the idea of dying and secretly took a large dose of opium. She was found by someone and sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died at around 5 AM the next morning. Afterwards, the hospital notified the French Police Station, who sent detectives to the scene and transported the body to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for inspection.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhangshi</h3>
<p>Was Injured, Right Foot Broken by Yifeng Lumber Company</p>
<p>On the 13th of this month, Yifeng Lumber Company in the north of Dongjiadu stacked foreign pine wood haphazardly on the sidewalk, breaking the right foot of pedestrian Zhang Zhangshi. Because Zhang Suizhi, the manager of Yifeng Lumber Company, was stubbornly unreasonable and did not pay any medical expenses, the prosecutor handled the matter according to law and personally went to Zhang Zhangshi's home to search for evidence. It was learned that Zhang Zhangshi was being treated at the Orthopedic Hospital and had already had her right foot amputated. On the 21st, a summons was issued for questioning. Dong Zhenhua from Yifeng Lumber Company appeared in court and was ordered to fully acknowledge the medical expenses and provide temporary bail. If he did not comply, Zhang Suizhi would be brought to court for severe punishment. Zhang Zhangshi's eldest daughter, Feng Zhangshi, appeared in court to complain about the harm she had suffered. The prosecutor was very sympathetic and comforted her repeatedly before she left.</p>
<h3>Huang Lu Case</h3>
<p>Supreme Court Judgment Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>A telegram from Suzhou on the 22nd stated that in the Huang Lu case, the prosecutor of the High Court did not accept the judgment of Lu Genrong's innocence and appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court rejected the appeal. The judgment of the Supreme Court has now been handed over by the High Court to Lawyer Song to be delivered to Lu Genrong in Shanghai. The original text is about 1,200 words, and the main points are that the jewelry carried by Huang Huiru was brought out by herself, and Lu Genrong had not heard of it beforehand. The statement by Huang Zhu that Lu Genrong helped with the theft had no evidence. Therefore, the original judgment of the High Court was deemed extremely appropriate, and the appeal was rejected.</p>

<h3>Second Relief for Disaster Victims by Zhabei Charity Group</h3>
<p>Wang Bin Yan, the director of Zhabei Charity Group, distributed rice to the disaster victims of the Hejiazhai Shanghai War a month ago. It has now been a month, and the disaster victims are worried that the weather is getting colder and they have no means of clothing, food, and shelter. They are all appealing and requesting continued relief. A delegation, including He Huijun, went to plead with Director Wang Bin Yan a few days ago, and he fully accepted their request. Yesterday at 3 PM, another nine stones of rice were distributed to the delegation, including He Huijun, He Bingwen, He Ruiren, He Wenxiao, He Genyuan, and He Yongjia, to distribute to the disaster victims in Xiaoguanyuan, Zhabei. There are also plans for loans and housing construction, which can be realized soon. The disaster victims were overjoyed and grateful when they learned of this.</p>
<h3>Guangyuan Stone Mining Company Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>In recent years, cosmetics, rubber products, paints, and various craft supplies have flourished, which is a good sign of the progress of domestic products. An important raw material for various crafts is calcium carbonate, which is extracted from a type of green stone. Fengshan, Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, produces a large amount of green stone, which is very suitable for extraction. Chen Qinshi, Chen Aishi, Shen Tianxin, Pan Zhaobang, and other gentry and merchants from Huzhou have organized the Guangyuan Stone Mining Company to engage in mining. A development initiation meeting was held at Lake Society the day before yesterday, chaired by Pan Zhaobang and recorded by Dong Yu. Chen Qinshi, Chen Aishi, Shen Tianxin, Pan Zhaobang, Wu Cheng, Dong Yu, Ma Shaoquan, Feng Zulan, Pan Fengyu, Li Renfu, Li Boxiong, Li Wenhua, Xu Tang, Shi Junhai, and Tang Guohua were elected as 15 preparatory members. Shares were subscribed on the spot, and business began.</p>
<h3>Creation of Domestic Transparent Rubber Products</h3>
<p>Transparent rubber products, such as hand warmers, gloves, pacifiers, fountain pens, inner straws, light balloons in toys, medicine droppers, etc., have never been produced domestically and all come from various countries in the East and West. The annual number is not small, and the import of Japanese goods is the most. Chinese people hope that domestic products will be produced to replace them. Now, industrial chemical researchers have gradually completed the research and development of rubber products. The chemicals used are self-made, and all the engineering is invented by Mr. Shen. The methods are the same as those in the East and West. The elasticity of the products is very strong and extremely durable, far superior to Japanese goods. This is not advertising and can be verified. For example, Japanese pacifiers can be torn apart, and they are very easy to break when scratched with a fingernail. Mr. Shen's products cannot be torn apart, and are not affected by fingernail scratches. He has also invented a type of rubber finger cot, available in transparent, yellow, red, and other colors. The colors are bright. When worn on the finger, it can protect the beauty of the fingernails and prevent dirt from being hidden in the nail crevices. If finger cots are used when eating, the spread of disease can be avoided. The price is also very low. The Puyi Chemical Company at No. 55 Ximen Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, has been shipping products. In recent days, inquiries and orders have been pouring in, and the company is quite overwhelmed. This is also good news in the midst of advocating domestic products.</p>
<h3>Japanese Language Expert Zhang Jingsheng Opens School</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Jingsheng is the second son of Mr. Zhang Mengzhou, a wealthy overseas Chinese merchant in Japan. He graduated from the Department of Political Science at Waseda University last year. After returning to China, he served as an editor at the Japanese Research Society and a professor in the Japanese Department at Shanghai University. He has a good reputation. Now, he expresses his sympathy for the poor children in Shanghai and plans to establish a free Japanese language school to cultivate useful talents. It is said that the registration office is temporarily located at No. 31, Dayi Apartment, No. 493 Pobo Road, French Concession. Registration starts immediately.</p>
<h3>Current Status of Taoist Association Charity School and Clinic</h3>
<p>The two Hongdao Free Primary Schools attached to the Chinese Taoist Association in Qiaojiazh, within the Dananmen, have been made more complete thanks to the enthusiastic planning of school director Yao Minghui and the tireless support of Weng Yinchu and Yu Baoqing. This semester, more teachers have been hired and more subjects have been added, so more children from poor families are seeking education. Since the start of the semester, registration has continued. In addition, the clinic attached to the association has decided to continue to provide regular consultations every day to benefit the poor, because the weather this summer was too hot, and the general public did not pay attention to hygiene or take care with their diet, resulting in an uncountable number of people suffering from typhoid fever and malaria since the autumn.</p>
<h3>Inexpensive Dishes at the Sichuan Road YMCA Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>The Western Restaurant Department of the Sichuan Road YMCA has recently made major internal reforms to ensure cleanliness as the weather gets colder. It has hired famous chefs specializing in cooking. The second-in-command chefs have also been replaced. The dishes are not only excellent in color, aroma, and taste, but also very generous. Therefore, the seats are often full for lunch and dinner every day. Recently, the department director, Mr. Lin, in order to provide better service to patrons, has added Quaker American-style dishes, which are sold for only 6 jiao and 5 fen per serving. The price is economical and the dishes are beautiful. They are widely recognized as the only inexpensive dishes in Shanghai. In addition, breakfast and various pastries and sweets are all of high quality and low price, satisfying customers.</p>

<h3>Selling Oneself and Reporters</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Yesterday's "Selling Oneself" reminded me of what a certain gentleman said the other day about "Awkward Literati." I compared the two, and it seems that even slaves have themselves to sell and someone to rely on, while the average awkward literati truly want to "sell themselves and rely on someone" but cannot, and must remain awkward.</p>
<p>So-called awkward literati, in other words, are generally men in long gowns. Among the men in long gowns, there are indeed a few who are successful and extraordinarily wealthy, but they are a minority of the minority. Among Chinese literati, how many have "cultivated themselves" to such an extent? The rest are truly extremely boring and awkward. Suppose they want to give up the pen for the sword, they don't understand the Six Secret Teachings and the Three Strategies; their shoulders cannot bear a gun, and their hands cannot fire a cannon. If they want to pick scallions and sell vegetables, learning the life of a farmer, their shoulders cannot bear the weight, and they don't have a loud and clear voice to shout along the way. It truly makes me difficult to decide what to do.</p>
<p>The few teachers who earn their living by lecturing are also awkward literati, and also friends who "sell themselves and rely on someone." They carry their briefcases every day and run to the school to give lectures. If the relationship between teachers and students is good, it's fine, but if the relationship is not good, these few Qiqiu gentlemen will get angry. The school authorities, fearing that a disturbance will develop into a trend, which will inevitably affect them financially, urgently issue an order like "prohibiting the keeping of slaves." The eyes of these teachers will go "domino-style." The principal can only reluctantly help, and the teachers can only scurry away like rats, forced to find another place to "sell themselves and rely on someone." This is also the dead end of awkward literati.</p>
<p>Are we reporters who earn our living by writing not "selling ourselves and relying on someone"? But the few elder sisters and younger sisters who sell themselves and rely on someone still have a day when they reach a certain age and are sent off to be married. We who "sell ourselves and rely on someone" are even more afraid that our masters will issue an order to "prohibit the keeping of slaves" for failing to carry out orders effectively and send us home. At that time, our rice bowl will be smashed to pieces. Therefore, we desperately hold on to it with both hands. If it is smashed, the seven necessities of life in the family will become a problem. And we awkward literati have no other careers to pursue. In the end, we either go to the roadside to file complaints or set up a fortune-telling stall, writing a few fake love letters to some young ladies on behalf of Mr. Jin or Little Ah Niu to communicate secret feelings with some young masters. This is also a dead end for awkward literati.</p>
<p>Even more pitiful are the few contributing writers. They originally had a place to "sell themselves and rely on someone" and used it as a side job, needless to say. Or they are content with their family income and use their writing to express their opinions, which is also excluded. But if they have no place to sell themselves and rely solely on writing to make a living, it is truly pitiful. They spend their days racking their brains, writing a lengthy article, carefully sealing it, and throwing it into the mailbox, hoping that it will be published in the newspaper the next day. Who knew that when they look the next day, it is not in the newspaper, which is extremely disappointing. When they look the day after tomorrow, it is still "no news at all, the yellow dog barks strangely." They cannot help but go from disappointment to resentment, from resentment to scolding. If it is published, they read it themselves and find that it is really nothing, and although they still don't have enough money for shoes and socks, at least they have managed to solve their cigarette expenses. This is also one of the awkward literati.</p>
<p>I have already written quite a bit today. If I have time tomorrow, I will continue to write. Otherwise, I will have to say goodbye here.</p>

<p>Truly the eaves and tent settled before the room.</p>
<p>Fitting to express my feelings in a line of poetry,</p>
<p>A general's star has arrived once more by Lake Li.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I called out to the old man of Sixty-One,</p>
<p>My sincere feelings followed the ancient style.</p>
<p>A fine poem bestowed from a lofty carriage passing by,</p>
<p>Since then, this humble home has never been empty.</p>
<p>Twin peaks face each other at the mouth of Poyang Lake,</p>
<p>I have climbed repeatedly, gazing at the distant sky.</p>
<p>Writing out the true interest of Stone Bell,</p>
<p>Your brushstrokes, sir, surpass Longmian.</p>
<p>Mountain and river passes are dangerous at Wuyang Town,</p>
<p>For days, I followed and accompanied you on banquets and tours.</p>
<p>Who can turn back the raging torrents before my eyes?</p>
<p>I beg you, sir, to be a pillar in the middle stream.</p>
<p>Thunderous clanging of a broken clay pot, the yellow bell is destroyed,</p>
<p>Turbid and clear are indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Wind and rain scatter, you cast your shadow.</p>
<p>How can I repay this peaceful age?</p>

<h3>Etching Techniques</h3>
<p>— Shen Yong</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>How beautiful are the clothes with different colors and patterns. If they were solely dependent on some artistry during the textile process, even the most outstanding weaver would not be able to produce the beautiful patterns on the fabrics we see today. Therefore, this is entirely due to the merit of printing and dyeing techniques. Among printing and dyeing techniques, in addition to direct printing and dyeing, etching plays a very important role. It is much easier to create white patterns on colored fabrics using etching. Furthermore, recently, a method has been invented to etch patterns of color using etching techniques. Therefore, this is a great contribution to the textile industry and deserves a brief introduction.</p>
<p>Originally, there were tin salt etching methods and gas salt etching methods. Recently, the use of sulfurous acid hydroxide as an important chemical in etching agents has been invented. This chemical not only has etching properties but also does not have the disadvantage of corroding various fibers. Now, the etching methods for wool fabrics, silk fabrics, and cotton fabrics will be described separately below:</p>
<p>1.  Etching of Wool Fabrics</p>
<p>The etching of wool fabrics mostly uses reducing agents. However, wool fibers themselves have weak reducing properties, which easily hinder etching. Therefore, before dyeing, one must pay attention to preparing the wool fabrics to be etched by immersing them in a solution with the following composition:</p>
<p>Water: 350 liters, Calcium hypochlorite solution: 5.2 liters, Hydrochloric acid solution: 3.5 liters. After immersing one or two times, wash with clean water. It is even better to replace hydrochloric acid with sulfuric acid. After washing clean, immerse in a concentrated sodium stannate solution for one hour, then immerse in a concentrated sulfuric acid solution, wash clean, and dry. Then, dye it, and you can use a reducing agent to perform etching. The result of etching will be various patterned fabrics. Here are two methods for formulating tin salt etching agents:</p>
<p>(A) Tin Salt White Etching Agent</p>
<p>Tin salt: 250 grams, Acetic acid: 125 grams, Acidic starch thickener: 550 grams, Sodium acetate: 60 grams,</p>
<p>Water: 150 grams</p>
<p>(B) Tin Salt Colored Etching Agent</p>
<p>Dye: 40 grams, Water: 150 grams, Acetic acid: 125 grams, Acidic starch thickener: 550 grams, Tin salt: 160 grams, Citric acid: 30 grams, Sodium acetate: 50 grams, Glycerin: 30 grams</p>
<p>After printing with these two etching agents, they must be steamed for fifteen to thirty minutes, then taken out and washed clean. Then, the etching procedure is complete.</p>
<p>There is also another type of sulfurous acid hydroxide salt etching agent. However, when applying it, a small amount of zinc white must be added to maintain the clean white color of the etched area. Because zinc white does not easily bond firmly with the fibers of the fabric, some protein must also be added. If it is colored, it is not necessary. The composition of these two etching agents is written down:</p>
<p>(A) Sulfurous Acid Hydroxide Salt White Etching Agent</p>
<p>Sulfurous acid hydroxide salt: 350 grams, Water: 300 grams, Industrial rubber: 80 grams, Zinc white: 350 grams, Protein: 160 grams, Turpentine: 7 grams,</p>
<p>(B) Sulfurous Acid Hydroxide Salt Colored Etching Agent</p>
<p>Dye: 40 grams, Water: 380 grams, B.R. gum thickener: 650 grams, Sulfurous acid hydroxide salt: 180 grams,</p>
<p>After printing with this etching agent, it must also be steamed for five to ten minutes, and then washed clean.</p>

<h3>The End of the Early Marriage Debate</h3>
<p>A Yan</p>
<p>| Reply to Mr. Wenbing |</p>
<p>I firmly believe that the understanding of facts differs depending on the perspective one holds. The so-called "the wise see wisdom, the benevolent see benevolence" is this principle. Even when it comes to the general understanding of Chinese problems, there are many completely different views. Some believe that China is currently a feudal or semi-feudal society, or a society dominated by feudal forces. Some believe that China is currently a capitalist society. Some believe that China is a society where feudal forces are making a final struggle and capitalism is gradually rising. Among these many different arguments, of course, there is only one truth. The others are either wrong in their method of observation or have made mistakes in their arguments.</p>
<p>I feel the same way about myself. I do not firmly believe that my observations are immutable truths. I believe that truth must be established through exploration and generalization by the majority of people. Therefore, I express my extreme gratitude for Mr. Wenbing's criticism of my observations on early marriage. However, after analyzing the results from my own perspective, I feel that there is still a need to extend my response to Mr. Wenbing's instructions.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of early marriage occurs in feudal societies with relatively strong ethical concepts. At the same time, it was also a self-sufficient agricultural society with simple economic organization and relatively easy livelihoods. This is the reason why the phenomenon of early marriage was so prevalent at that time.</p>
<p>But what about now? China has been groaning under the economic aggression of international imperialism for nearly a century. China's current economic form has undergone tremendous changes. The so-called self-sufficient agricultural society has long become a historical term. China has now crossed over from an agricultural society to a commercial society and is heading towards a capitalist society faster. Not only is making a living not easy, but the majority of people are unable to live. Ethical concepts and traditional ideas of propriety were originally a reflection of the political system and economic form of the time. At present, they have shed their feudal cloaks and possess the rudiments of a capitalist economy. Aren't old ideas gradually being destroyed? Can we still say that there are so-called ethical concepts in the rural villages of various provinces occupied by the Communist bandits and Red Army? It has long been a case of "the world is deteriorating, and people's hearts are not as good as they used to be." The rice-grabbing riots of farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang this year were not the work of those rebels against old ideas? However, partial facts are of course inevitable. However, we should grasp the whole. If a foreigner went to Guangxi and viewed the lives of the Yao people as representative of the lives of our entire Chinese nation, then he would be greatly mistaken.</p>
<p>According to the above, the reasons for the occurrence of early marriage no longer exist, so the problem of early marriage can no longer be considered a problem. If Mr. Wenbing wants to completely eliminate some exceptional cases of early marriage, it is a relatively easy thing to do, but it is also superfluous. In fact, even if Mr. Wenbing firmly believes in the existence of the problem of early marriage, is it not just a minor issue of the women's problem or the entire social problem?</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Wenbing said, "Even if people are economically well-off, is early marriage right? It's laughable!" This is obviously Mr. Wenbing's misunderstanding. I have long stated that I do not advocate early marriage. I did not say that early marriage is right or beneficial. I only said that although early marriage is harmful, it is not absolute but relative. Giving early marriage to a certain type of person can instead remedy their morbid state. I do not advocate using early marriage to cure the masturbation of young people, and I would never be so bold and absurd.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Wenbing asked me, "Mr. A also said that the combination of the two sexes in the future can be left to nature, ... I don't know if Mr. A has thought about this statement!" This does not require thinking. I fundamentally do not advocate using laws or other unnatural methods to restrict the freedom of the two sexes. The two sexes have common needs and can combine naturally. "The combination of twelve- or thirteen-year-old boys and girls" is something I have never advocated. Even animals must go through a considerable period of time after birth before mating with the opposite sex, let alone humans? If Mr. Wenbing is afraid that advocating the natural combination of the two sexes will lead to the free combination of twelve- or thirteen-year-old boys and girls, then he is too worried. Humanity will always have the guidance of elders. Even in the future utopian society, after political and legal systems are abolished, education will continue to exist.</p>
<p>The two phrases Mr. Wenbing offered to me, "Facts are eloquent, and one should focus on the big picture when looking at problems," are things that not only I, but everyone, will humbly accept. As for these debates, I think I will end them here. If anyone else has criticism of my writing, please forgive me for not responding again.</p>
