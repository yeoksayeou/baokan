<p>時評</p>
<h3>正告二中全會㈡·彬</h3>
<p>自去年九一八以來。政府即無日不誥誡。人民以精誠團結。共赴國難。至於今日。國民固早已覺悟。必須一致對外。始足以打破目前之艱難。然而國民黨內則仍派別分歧黨人已忘其一黨同一之立塲。黨中之領袖。亦不能容納黨員之意見。一黨之內。政見各異。京中委主張如此滬粵中委主張又如彼。吾人自局外觀之。在形式上在精神上。國民黨殆都已不能承認爲一整個之政黨。而實爲幾種角逐於政治舞台上之勢力。特以迫於外患。故在目前尙未敢公然明爭。所謂團結。所謂共赴國難。亦正如放烟幕彈。使人民被籠罩於五里霧中。而暫時蔽塞其耳目耳。</p>
<p>國民黨主政六年。於我國家我人民曾有何政績。不過徒存留若干宣言决議案紙上之史料耳黨政當局或將曰。六年來反動迭作。屢興兵戎。政府戡亂之不暇。更何由而措庶政於安定。甚或且引他國革命過程中之內亂與鞏固政權之艱難爲證。是誠然矣。然而否否。蓋革命固極艱難。必有長期之奮鬥。但如亂者爲外患。反動者爲政敵則無所有於艱難也。今國民黨主政六年。在去年九一八以前。固無外患。亦無政敵作有力之反動也。所謂「反動派。」適皆爲黨內「同志」所謂戡亂恰爲黨人與黨人軍閥與軍閥間之爭權奪利此種奮鬥。固能安定我國家耶。六年來人民予國民黨以充分之機會。舉國脈民命皆操諸國民黨。甚至負荷一切不應負荷之義務。而國民在任何國家中應享最小限度之權利。都被剝奪亦竭力忍受。我人民可謂毫無負於國民黨。然而國民黨則已自失其報國之機會。此國民黨在今日所應鄭重反省者也。</p>
<p>自九一八迄今。外侮日亟。黨政當局。侮不能禦。土不能守。在我人民雖痛澈肝脾。猶竭力隠忍。茹苦含辛。忍痛團結。冀以誠摯之督責。促國民黨最後之覺悟。視此次人民對於孤軍抗暴之十九路軍之慰勞與愛護。應亦可以絕對相信而無疑然而國民黨究將何以壓我人民之望耶。</p>
<p>邇來時論。大都認爲國民黨已無力單獨救國。亟應取銷一黨專政。公開政權。此一主張。吾人認爲國民黨在今日應予以鄭重之考慮。蓋國難至此。存亡之機。間不容髪。固已不必待人民之要求。當自動停止訓政。實行憲政。公開政治。使人民得參與政治與共赴國難之機會。此時而公開政治。即人民另起而組織政黨。亦爲救國而非爲爭權奪利也。英國此次爲打破國難。亦曾組織混合內閣。此種先國後黨之精神。國民黨應資爲借鏡。至於藉國難會議以敷衍人民。并减輕責任。於國無補。徒增糾紛。蓋策之下焉者耳。</p>
<p>故吾人爲國民黨計。今日之事。但有兩途。一爲禦侮衛國。以救國自救。一爲公開政權。俾人民得自起救國。何去何從。國民黨其善自擇之。</p>

<h3>日軍仍圖進攻</h3>

<p>▲意在轉移國聯感情</p>

<p>巿府否認</p>
<h3>外兵警衛閘北</h3>
<p>▲華商應爲政府後盾</p>
<p>▲正式團體應起聲明</p>
<p>字林報云、第十九路軍已退出閘北及上海周圍各區、今乃有一問題、即華人是否願照日本原議、在租界周圍設立中立區域、而許外國軍隊警衛該區域乎、本埠華人對於該問題、意見大相歧異、領袖華商數人、對於中立區域之計劃、緘默無言、但頗贊成外兵警衛華軍退出之區域、尤以閘北爲最、以期减少該區域華人之困難、彼等謂閘北戰事雖停而已成爲一片火塲、房屋被燬者數千所、目下最急要之務、爲使消防隊得即恢復職務、俾可撲滅火災、又謂戰區難民避居租界者、數十萬</p>
<p>人、今急當設法使之歸其故居、以减租界</p>
<p>之累、此唯能由外國領事在中日當局間斡旋、商妥辦法、領袖華商並希望彼等能商諸吳巿長、請領袖領事克銀漢與日總領事協商、派外兵入閘北、保護中國居民、惟據上海巿政府某要員受稱、本埠中國當局切實拒絕派外兵入閘北或其他任何中國境內之提議、若承認此項提議、不啻承認在上海關一外國新租界、此爲政府所决不能接受者、日軍違法攻佔閘北、巿政府唯一途徑、厥爲呈請中央政府擔負處理關於此事各問題之責任云、（譯者</p>
<p>按、本埠領袖華商、决不致有無心肝若此者、是必爲外報製造空氣之作用、然以此誣我華商、我華商正式團體、不可不發一言、以駁斥之、）</p>
<h3>白川陣亡說之由來</h3>
<p>本埠昨日外間盛傳日軍司令白川陣亡、當經本報向中外各方多方探聽、均云未有所聞、至於日領館之下半旗、聞係爲陣亡將士誌哀云、</p>
<h3>我軍退防華僑惶急</h3>
<p>▲巴拿馬華商會來電詢問</p>
<p>自日軍大舉攻滬後、海外僑胞、尤深憤慨、匯欵犒軍、異常踴躍、自我軍變更戰略、縮短防線後、僑胞聞訊、甚爲驚訝、日昨巴拿馬中華商會特電巿商會詢問、原電云、我軍撤防、僑情惶急、情形如何、請即見復、聞巿商會已將撤退滬防及繼續抵抗情形、電復該會矣、</p>
<h3>救國聯合會之慰辭</h3>

        <h1>1932.03.05</h1>
<h3>Formal Announcement to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee (2) · Bin</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident last year, the government has ceaselessly exhorted the people to unite with utmost sincerity and face the national crisis together. By now, the people have long realized that only by uniting against external aggression can we overcome the current difficulties. However, within the Kuomintang, factions remain divided, and party members have forgotten their unified stance as members of a single party. Leaders within the party are also unable to accommodate the opinions of party members. Within a single party, political views differ. Central Executive Committee members in the capital advocate one thing, while those in Shanghai and Guangdong advocate another. From our perspective as outsiders, it appears that the Kuomintang, in both form and spirit, can no longer be recognized as a unified political party. Instead, it resembles several forces vying for power on the political stage, only refraining from open conflict due to the pressure of foreign aggression. The so-called unity and shared effort to overcome the national crisis are merely smoke and mirrors, intended to shroud the people in confusion and temporarily block their senses.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang has been in power for six years. What achievements have they made for our country and our people? They have merely left behind some declarations and resolutions, historical materials on paper. The party and government authorities may argue that counter-revolutionary activities have occurred repeatedly over the past six years, with constant military conflicts, leaving the government with no time to quell the unrest, let alone implement stable policies. They may even cite the internal turmoil and difficulties in consolidating power during other countries' revolutionary processes as evidence. This may be true. However, is it really? Revolution is indeed extremely difficult and requires a long period of struggle. But if the unrest is due to foreign aggression and the counter-revolutionary forces are political enemies, then there is no inherent difficulty. The Kuomintang has been in power for six years, and before the September 18th Incident last year, there was no foreign aggression, nor were there any political enemies engaging in effective counter-revolutionary activities. The so-called "counter-revolutionaries" were merely "comrades" within the party, and the so-called quelling of unrest was simply a struggle for power and profit among party members, warlords, and military factions. Can this kind of struggle truly stabilize our country? Over the past six years, the people have given the Kuomintang ample opportunity, entrusting the nation's lifeline and the people's fate to the party, even bearing obligations that should not have been borne. The minimal rights that people should enjoy in any country have been stripped away, yet they have endured it all. It can be said that our people have done nothing to fail the Kuomintang. However, the Kuomintang has failed to seize the opportunity to repay the nation. This is what the Kuomintang should seriously reflect on today.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, foreign aggression has intensified daily. The party and government authorities have been unable to resist the aggression or defend the territory. Although our people feel deep pain and sorrow, they have persevered, swallowing bitterness, enduring hardship, and uniting with forbearance, hoping to urge the Kuomintang to finally awaken through sincere supervision and responsibility. The people's慰 問 and support for the 19th Route Army's resistance against brutality should be absolutely trusted and unquestionable. However, how will the Kuomintang repay the hopes of our people?</p>
<p>Recently, current opinions largely believe that the Kuomintang is incapable of saving the country alone and that it should abolish its one-party dictatorship and open up the government. We believe that the Kuomintang should give serious consideration to this proposal today. The national crisis has reached this point, and the opportunity for survival or destruction hangs by a thread. There is no need to wait for the people's demands; the Kuomintang should automatically cease political tutelage, implement constitutional government, and open up politics, allowing the people to participate in politics and join in the effort to overcome the national crisis. If politics are opened up at this time, even if the people establish new political parties, it will be for the sake of saving the country, not for vying for power and profit. To overcome the current national crisis, England also formed a coalition cabinet. The Kuomintang should take this spirit of prioritizing the country over the party as a model. As for using a national crisis conference to appease the people and reduce responsibility, it will not help the country and will only increase disputes. This is the worst possible strategy.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of the Kuomintang, there are only two paths forward today. One is to resist aggression and defend the country, saving both the nation and itself. The other is to open up the government, allowing the people to save the country on their own. Which path to take is for the Kuomintang to choose wisely.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Reinforcements Arrive at the Front Lines</h3>
<p>▲ National Government Announces Recapture of Liuhe</p>
<p>▲ Enemy Forces Suffer Losses at Loutang Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Determined Not to Accept Humiliating Terms</p>
<h3>National Government Announces Battle Report</h3>
<p>▲ Our Forces Recapture Liuhe</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Nanjing, 4th: The National Government today released a battle report stating that Chinese forces recaptured Liuhe yesterday afternoon. The report stated: "A detachment of the 19th Route Army defending the Wusong Fort retreated from the fort area at 9:00 AM yesterday. Its main force arrived in Liuhe at 5:00 PM. Our reinforcements, the 47th Division under Shangguan Yunxiang and the 9th Division under Jiang Dingwen, advancing towards Liuhe from Jiading and Nanxiang, engaged the enemy's 11th Division at Liuhe. The 19th Route Army, retreating from Wusong, joined forces and attacked the Japanese army. Feng Yuxiang's army of 20,000 men has arrived in Taicang."</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Suffer Losses at Loutang</h3>
<p>More than 10,000 enemy troops in Loutang Town, between Taicang and Jiading, launched a general offensive against our forces at 6:30 PM the day before yesterday. Our newly arrived reinforcements immediately fought back. Although the Japanese army had tanks and armored vehicles, the area was densely packed with houses and winding rivers, preventing the enemy from succeeding. In addition, they were unfamiliar with the terrain, so they suffered losses. The battle lasted until late last night. Our army divided its forces into four routes, encircling the enemy's rear. The enemy fought hard for a long time but could not prevail. The stalemate continued until yesterday morning. Except for a portion of the enemy troops that broke through and escaped, the rest were eliminated. Our army also captured many spoils of war.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Still Plans to Attack</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Suspend Hostilities</p>
<p>▲ Intended to Sway League of Nations Sentiment</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that although the Japanese commander has declared a suspension of hostilities, General Cai Tingkai stated last night (the 3rd) that the Japanese army is not satisfied with the Chinese army's voluntary withdrawal of 20 kilometers and is planning to attack the Chinese lines north of Nanxiang. The Japanese claim that the suspension of hostilities is merely propaganda intended to sway the League of Nations' sentiment. However, the Chinese army's positions are very solid and will certainly repel the Japanese army's attack.</p>
<h3>The Sound of Firecrackers Last Night</h3>
<p>Upon learning that our reinforcements had arrived at the front lines, people from all walks of life in this city were overjoyed and set off firecrackers and sky lanterns from about 6:00 PM until 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Cables for Urgent Decision On</p>
<h3>Overall Self-Defense Plan</h3>
<p>▲ If Resistance Is Not Planned Quickly</p>
<p>▲ The Future Will Be Even More Dangerous</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army has occupied Zhabei and our government has no reinforcements coming to Shanghai, Central Executive Committee member Kong Xiangxi urgently cabled the Second Plenary Session in Luoyang yesterday, urging them to quickly decide on an overall self-defense plan. The original telegram read: "Urgent, respectfully addressed to the members of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in Luoyang, confidential: The Japanese invasion of Shanghai occurred suddenly, and the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army bravely fought and repeatedly thwarted the enemy's fierce attacks, defending the Party and the nation, which is admired by the world. I comforted the front lines and personally witnessed the military officers leading from the front and commanding in person. Their loyalty and righteousness are deeply moving. However, yesterday our army retreated to the second line of defense. Because of the disparity in numbers and because the rear route in Liuhe was attacked and occupied by the Japanese army, our army was in danger of being cut off. It was inevitable to change the strategy. I have witnessed this in Shanghai and am concerned about it. Therefore, I have repeatedly telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission, requesting immediate reinforcements for defense and consolidation of the rear. Today, my concerns have unfortunately been confirmed, which is deeply regrettable. Public opinion here is extremely angry and blames the government for its lack of preparation in advance and its failure to send reinforcements in a timely manner. Moreover, at that time, during the emergency of the self-defense military operation against Japan, there was no person responsible for commanding the national military, which led to the great achievements of defeating the enemy in a month-long bloody battle being completely wasted. The accusations are such that public anger is evident. It is now reported that the Japanese army, after occupying Zhabei and Zhenru, still does not repent and is advancing towards Nanxiang and Xinlonghua. If resistance is not planned quickly at this time, the future will be even more dangerous. In this urgent situation, we should learn from the past and be cautious in the future. I respectfully request the Plenary Session to quickly decide on an overall self-defense plan to facilitate military operations and console the public. This is my special telegram. Respectfully requesting your consideration and acceptance, Kong Xiangxi bows, Jiang."</p>
<h3>Telegrams from Various Parties Requesting Reinforcements</h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce cabled the National Government yesterday, saying, "Respectfully addressed to the National Government in Luoyang, the Military Affairs Commission, and the Executive Yuan: The fierce fighting in Shanghai has lasted for a month. Except for Zhang Zhizhong's department, the central government has not sent any subsequent reinforcements. The Japanese bandits have arrived one after another, causing the isolated army to be trapped in a desperate situation and forced to retreat, increasing the arrogance of the enemy and crushing the spirit of the righteous soldiers. After occupying Shanghai, the Japanese have burned and vented their anger, and the remaining villages have been turned into ashes. Millions of citizens have been reduced to prisoners, which is lamentable. Now our army has already retreated beyond 20 kilometers, but the enemy is still pressing forward. Even if we seek temporary peace, it is unattainable. It seems that half of southeastern China will fall into the hands of the enemy. If the government has not forgotten its declaration of long-term resistance, it should quickly send a large army to recover Shanghai to seek self-redemption. It must be understood that strong bandits cannot be deterred by empty words. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows, Jiang."</p>
<p>▲ Ningbo Association: Two Urgent Telegrams from the Ningbo Association:</p>
<p>(1) "Respectfully addressed to the members of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in Luoyang and the ministries and commissions of the National Government: Since the brutal army in Shanghai imitated the old tricks of invading Northeast China and attacked Zhabei, more than a month has passed. During this month, our brave soldiers on the front lines sacrificed their blood and flesh and did their best to defend themselves. Their righteous声 誉 has changed international public opinion. We were hoping to recover our lost territory and enhance our nation's glory, starting from this point. Unexpectedly, the enemy, after suffering a disastrous defeat, induced peace talks and increased reinforcements. The ambitions of Ueda were not achieved, and then General Shirakawa followed. Aside from the soldiers of the 87th and 88th Divisions who joined the battle with righteousness, we only heard calls for long-term resistance and planned strategies, but we did not see a single soldier arriving to support us. In the end, due to the disparity in numbers, we had to endure the pain and drink tears, abandoning the battle strategy and changing to defend the line, causing the scope of the people's suffering to expand further. The troops who stubbornly defended Wusong waited to die for righteousness. The good general will be折 損, and the national territory will be invaded. Whose fault is it? The Minister of Military Administration, He Yingqin, and the Chief of the General Staff, Zhu Peide, should be held responsible for neglecting to provide assistance and mismanaging the overall strategy. They neither sent troops to Northeast China to contain the brutal enemy nor increased troops to support Shanghai to strengthen our forces. They allowed the remaining 20,000 isolated troops who had been fighting for a long time to face the newly arrived 100,000 enemy troops alone. From the perspective of the times and the war, there is no excuse. Even if they did not intentionally neglect to provide assistance, they are not talented generals to govern the army. The members of our association are angry at their mismanagement of military operations and destruction of achievements. Based on the right granted to the people of the whole country by the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China to exercise sovereignty, we request the assembly to declare and investigate the Minister of Military Administration, He Yingqin, and the Chief of the General Staff, Zhu Peide, who neglected to provide assistance and mismanaged the overall strategy, based on the National Government's decision to engage in long-term resistance. They hold positions as members of the Central Executive Committee and attend meetings. We respectfully request that you unanimously advocate for severe punishment, and at the same time, select capable individuals and send troops to provide immediate assistance to jointly overcome the national crisis. Otherwise, the members of the assembly and the officials of the government will be responsible for humiliating the country and misleading the people. This urgent telegram is filled with tears and expresses our deepest concern. The Ningbo Association in Shanghai bows, Jiang."</p>
<p>(2) "Respectfully addressed to Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in Luoyang: Since the 19th Route Army and the soldiers of the 5th Army who came to Shanghai with righteousness defended themselves and resisted the Japanese army invading Shanghai, more than a month has passed. The enemy has not succeeded in any way. Not only has the boastful声 威 of胜 我胜 俄 been reduced to a worthless record, but their world-renowned warships and aircraft have also become tools for destroying civilian residences. International public opinion has changed because of this, and the national spirit has been inspired. We thought that we could kill the enemy to avenge our shame and recover our lost territory in due course. Unexpectedly, there was no follow-up support, and the enemy divisions arrived three times. The soldiers on the front lines were forced to retreat due to the disparity in numbers. Their flesh and blood were wasted, and their heroic achievements were destroyed in one fell swoop. Anyone with a heart would feel pain and anger. The members of our association, knowing that the national crisis is becoming more urgent and driven by conscience, have already invoked the right to dismiss officials granted to the people by the Provisional Constitution and telegraphed the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and the National Government, advocating for the investigation and removal of the Minister of Military Administration, He Yingqin, and the Chief of the General Staff, Zhu Peide, who neglected to provide assistance and mismanaged the overall strategy. Since Mr. 朱 培德 holds a position as a member of the Central Executive Committee and attends meetings, we respectfully request that you unanimously advocate for immediate and severe punishment and volunteer to lead troops to Shanghai so that Mr. Chiang's declarations of preparing to go north and being at the forefront of defense will all become reality. This will comfort the soldiers who are bleeding to resist the enemy and the people who are destroying their homes to relieve the national crisis, and externally, it will complete the heroic name of patriotism and fighting well and uphold the great achievements of the League of Nations. Then the glory of the nation will shine upon the world, and the people of the seven counties will be able to admire your heroic power together. If you do not do this, not only will the doubts of the people not be dispelled, but the previous achievements of the Northern Expedition will be destroyed. Although we love Mr. Chiang, we cannot forgive him. As the saying goes, the times create heroes. We hope that Mr. Chiang will not miss this opportunity to create a world-class great hero. This urgent telegram expresses our hope and prayer. We hope that you will cherish yourself. The Ningbo Association in Shanghai bows."</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Party Members: More than 1,000 party members in this city cabled the Second Plenary Session in Luoyang yesterday, saying: "Most urgent, respectfully addressed to the members of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in Luoyang: The brutal Japanese are pouring their efforts into invading Shanghai. Our 19th Route Army is resisting bravely and fighting bitterly for more than a month. In the end, due to the isolation of the army and the lack of reinforcements, they were forced to retreat. When the bad news spread, the whole country was grief-stricken. Our central government has repeatedly announced to the people that it will definitely recover the lost territory and resist aggression and defend against insult, and it has heavily reinforced Shanghai, which has been widely reported in newspapers. Why did it retreat and sit idly by, causing danger? The lives and property of three million people are left to the brutal Japanese to trample and slaughter. How will the central government face our people? At this critical moment, it is impossible to salvage the situation through leisurely discussions. We respectfully request that the Plenary Session immediately send heavy troops to reinforce Shanghai, recover Shanghai, and transfer strong troops to recover the Northeast, and uphold the revolutionary diplomatic principles and never secretly compromise. The survival of the Party and the nation depends on this action. The party members have the heart to save the country but have no way to serve it. As long as there is still a breath, we are unwilling to sit idly by and watch the country perish. We plead with the Plenary Session to quickly decide on a plan to resist Japan. This urgent telegram expresses our deep anxiety and earnest prayer. Wang Zhisheng, Zhang Juansheng, Zhou Xidun, Shen Zuru, Jiang Hao, Chen Ya夫, Chen Xuanren, Tang Wenquan, Chen Baixin, Li Jiaojie, Cao Peizi, Zhang Tianbai, Deng Cihou, Jin Xihan, Chen Zhen, Xing Wan, Cheng Deyuan, Wang Qi, Sun Zuozhai, Liu Tongze, and 1,565 other party members of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang bow."</p>
<h3>Our Side Insists on Simultaneous Withdrawal of Troops</h3>
<p>▲ Humiliating Terms Proposed by the Japanese Side Are Unacceptable</p>
<p>▲ Guo Taiqi Denies Opening Round Table Conference</p>
<p>Regarding the reports that representatives from China, Japan, and other related countries will hold a round table conference within one or two days to discuss the Shanghai situation, Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi yesterday denied this claim. Vice Minister Guo further stated to our reporter that he had no knowledge of this method mentioned in the semi-official Japanese news, and said that if a round table conference is to be held, it must be predicated on Japan fulfilling the agreement to simultaneously withdraw troops, prevent further conflict, and immediately cease fire. Since Tuesday evening, the Chinese army has voluntarily withdrawn from Zhabei and the surrounding areas. Japan has taken advantage of our army's withdrawal and advanced in pursuit, extending over forty miles. (Today, 3,000 more Japanese troops landed in Liuhe.) In other words, our army's withdrawal to a safe distance was to promote an immediate ceasefire, but the Japanese arbitrarily forgot their proposal to League of Nations President Paul Hymans on February 29 for a simultaneous withdrawal of troops, expressing the lie of acceptance. Upon inspection, the understanding reached on the gunboat Ghent on February 28 was based on the principle of simultaneous withdrawal of troops, and Hymans' proposal was based on the British official report on the Ghent gunboat proposal. If the Japanese side does not acknowledge the fact of the Chinese army's withdrawal, continues to pursue the attack, and fulfills its lie of simultaneous withdrawal of troops, then the so-called round table conference, from the Chinese perspective, will never be possible. Guo further stated that the four humiliating conditions proposed in the Japanese reply are unacceptable to our side, and this point has been telegraphed to our representative in Geneva, Yan Huiqing, to argue forcefully.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Denies</p>
<h3>Foreign Troops Guarding Zhabei</h3>
<p>▲ Chinese Merchants Should Be the Government's Backbone</p>
<p>▲ Formal Organizations Should Issue Statements</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the 19th Route Army has withdrawn from Zhabei and the surrounding areas of Shanghai. Now there is a question of whether the Chinese people are willing to establish a neutral zone around the concessions as originally proposed by Japan and allow foreign troops to guard the area. The opinions of the Chinese people in this city on this issue are greatly divided. Several leading Chinese merchants are silent on the plan for a neutral zone but are quite in favor of foreign troops guarding the areas evacuated by the Chinese army, especially Zhabei, in order to reduce the difficulties of the Chinese people in that area. They said that although the fighting in Zhabei has stopped, it has become a fire zone with thousands of houses destroyed. The most urgent task now is to enable the fire brigade to resume its duties immediately so that it can put out the fires. It is also said that hundreds of thousands of refugees from the war zone are living in the concessions, and it is now necessary to find a way to return them to their homes in order to reduce the burden on the concessions. This can only be done by having the foreign consuls mediate between the Chinese and Japanese authorities and negotiate a solution. Leading Chinese merchants also hope that they can consult with Mayor Wu and request the leading consuls, 克 銀 漢, to negotiate with the Japanese Consul-General to send foreign troops into Zhabei to protect Chinese residents. However, according to a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Chinese authorities in this city firmly reject the proposal to send foreign troops into Zhabei or any other Chinese territory. To acknowledge this proposal would be tantamount to acknowledging a new foreign concession in Shanghai, which the government cannot accept. The only recourse for the Municipal Government for the Japanese army's illegal occupation of Zhabei is to request the central government to assume responsibility for handling all issues related to this matter. (Translator's Note: It is impossible for the leading Chinese merchants in this city to be so heartless. This must be the effect of foreign newspapers creating an atmosphere. However, since they are slandering our Chinese merchants in this way, the formal organizations of our Chinese merchants must speak out to refute it.)</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Report of Shirakawa's Death in Action</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were widespread rumors in the foreign community of this city that the Japanese commander Shirakawa had been killed in action. This newspaper has made many inquiries to various Chinese and foreign parties, all of whom said that they had not heard of this. As for the Japanese consulate flying its flag at half-mast, it is said to be in mourning for the soldiers who died in action.</p>
<h3>Our Army's Retreat Causes Panic Among Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>▲ Panama Chinese Chamber of Commerce Cables Inquiries</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army launched a large-scale attack on Shanghai, overseas Chinese have been particularly indignant and have enthusiastically remitted funds to犒 勞 the troops. After our army changed its strategy and shortened the defensive line, overseas Chinese were surprised when they heard the news. Yesterday, the Panama Chinese Chamber of Commerce specifically cabled the City Chamber of Commerce to inquire, saying: "Our army has withdrawn its defenses, and the overseas Chinese community is panicking. What is the situation? Please reply immediately." It is heard that the City Chamber of Commerce has already telegraphed the chamber with information about the retreat from the Shanghai defenses and the continuation of resistance.</p>
<h3>The National Salvation Association's Messages of Condolences</h3>
<p>▲ Letters of Respect to Generals Weng and Tan: Gentlemen, your army's tenacious defense of Wusong has indeed exerted its greatest effort, which the people fully understand and are greatly moved by. Therefore, we cherish your army and cannot bear for it to suffer excessive damage alone. Now that reinforcements have not arrived, it is hoped that your army and the various aspects of Dachan and Liuhe have an overall plan to jointly defend, which is what the people hope for. If a part is isolated and trapped in a desperate situation, it will reduce the strength of resistance against Japan, which is a matter of the greatest heartbreak. We earnestly hope that the two of you will handle it carefully. In short, resisting the brutal Japanese cannot be changed by the gains and losses of one place, and the people's enthusiasm to live and die together with your army will not change. Nor can it be replaced by a change in military strategy. In addition to entrusting Mr. Zhang Zilian to convey this in person, this is addressed to Brigade Commander Weng Huiteng and Commander Tan Qixiu.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the 19th Route Army: Respectfully addressed to Commander-in-Chief Jiang, Army Commander Cai, Commander Dai, and all the soldiers of the 19th Route Army, sent to Kunshan: You have all been loyal to the country and resisted the Japanese invasion, fought bloody battles for 34 days, and repeatedly thwarted the strong enemy, washing away the shame of our nation's fear of foreign wars, which is enough to make the enemy tremble and astonish the world. You have truly exerted your greatest effort. Because the government has not sent reinforcements, and the enemy has launched a large-scale surprise attack from the rear, you have had to endure the pain and obey the order to retreat. Our citizens of the entire city are infinitely saddened. The representatives of the various organizations belonging to this association unanimously wish to live and die together with our loyal and brave soldiers until we have driven the Japanese invaders out of the country and completely recovered our lost territory. Sincerely expressing our innermost feelings, we respectfully wish you all well. The Shanghai Joint Association of National Salvation Organizations bows.</p>
<p>Also, the Chaozhou Association in Shanghai's letter of condolence to the 19th Route Army says: "Respectfully addressed to Army Commander Cai: The Japanese invasion of Shanghai has caused anger throughout the country. Your army has bravely resisted, sharing the same hatred, and even with the ten thousand troops of the despicable captives, wielding their sharp weapons, they are still able to use the few to resist the many and repeatedly thwart the enemy's attacks, fighting bitterly for more than a month, adding glory to the nation. What is regrettable is that, in addition to the 5th Army that automatically came to Shanghai to participate in the battle, the government never transferred reinforcements, and with a battle line tens of miles long, the enemy troops continued to增 援, causing the enemy's large force to land in Liuhe to surround our army's rear. This total retreat was indeed inevitable, and we express our sympathy and share the hidden pain. However, our country's resistance to Japan should be a long-term plan, and the gains and losses of one time and one place are not enough to hold in our hearts. It is hoped that your army will continue to fight with comrades and friendly forces and implement its original intention. All sectors of the people will also unite to provide support, and with理 直 气 壮, with the last victory will belong to us. In addition to sending representatives from our association to the rear office of your army to inquire about what items are needed and find ways to transport them, we respectfully submit this letter of condolence and ask for your consideration. The Chaozhou Association in Shanghai bows."</p>
<p>The Opinions of the Central Executive Committee Members in Shanghai Regarding</p>
<h3>The Punishment of the Puppet State</h3>
<p>The Central Executive Committee members in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Second Plenary Session, expressing their opinions on the punishment of the puppet state. The original text is recorded as follows: "Respectfully addressed to the members of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in Luoyang: Since Japan invaded and occupied Northeast China and the three provinces fell, the government has tolerated it for several months without mentioning recovery. Japan has been able to calmly arrange to support the Han traitor Pu Yi, Zang Shiyi, Zhang Jinghui, etc. to create a second Korea, which is truly despicable. We recently heard that the government proposed to punish the puppet state in the Northeast. If it can resolutely send troops, it would be very good. However, the dispatch of troops must be justified. Pu Yi and 臧 张, like corpses, are being used by Japan as puppets in an attempt to cover up international scrutiny, which is a clever plan. If we recognize the loss of territory in the Northeast, we should always consider it to be forcibly occupied by the brutal Japanese, and there should be no transfer of the objective, so that Japan can be relieved of its responsibility. As for Pu Yi and Zang Zhang, who surrendered to Japan, their crime lies with them personally. After the fact, they should be arrested and handed over to the authorities to count their rebellions and明 正 典 刑, which would be appropriate. If we recognize them as enemy states, regardless of whether they are genuine or fake, it would be tantamount to recognizing them as countries. The United States has repeatedly declared that it does not recognize the facts created by the brutal Japanese in Northeast China, and in the petition to the League of Nations, it solemnly reiterated this statement. If we recognize that there is a country within our own country, changing from foreign to domestic, even friendly countries would have no basis to strongly argue on our behalf. If it is said that we are avoiding the greater for the lesser, avoiding direct conflict with the brutal Japanese, then the Japanese, who are blatantly defying the world, how can they slightly curb their ferocity with a transfer of an empty name? The heavy cannot be avoided, and the light will increase the weight. Therefore, we should recover our lost territory, send troops to resist Japan, and win in one battle. Then all the rebels will be eliminated by themselves. Even if we do not win, we can still take a step back and not recognize the facts created. If we are to punish the puppet state, and unfortunately we do not win, we will not even have the remaining ground to reserve the fact that we do not recognize it. This is a great miscalculation. What we fear, we dare not remain silent. We respectfully submit this opinion and ask for your consideration and acceptance, so that the puppet state created by Japan will not gain both fame and fortune. Fortunately, Cheng Qian, Ma Chaojun, Sun Ke, Sun Jingya, Zhang Zhiben, Liu Lu Yin, Xiong Kewu, He Shizhen, Yang Shukan, Gui Chongji, Huang Jilu, Bai Wenwei, Zhang Fa Kui."</p>

<h3>Most Earnest Declaration to the Nation</h3>
<p>▲ Diligence :: Thrift</p>
<p>▲ Patience :: Cooperation</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Education Circles National Salvation Joint Association declares: "To all compatriots across the country: The Japanese militarists have long harbored ambitions to invade China, disregarding world opinion and universal justice. They are even deliberately undermining the foundations of constitutional government and party politics in their own country. In recent years, Japanese soldiers have formed an organization called the "Brocade Banner Alliance," led by the current Minister of the Army, Araki. They are secretly active and aggressively working to seize national power internally to establish a militarist government, and to conquer China and dominate East Asia externally, with the United States and Russia as their enemies. They even advocate occupying the Northeast provinces to resist Russia, and seizing the provinces north of the Yangtze River as a base to fight the United States. Their absurd and rampant claims have reached this point. In their country, the common people and the intellectual society have long opposed this and consider it a cause for grief. Worldwide, people are uneasy and distressed. The Mukden Incident occurred, and the Japanese militarists' ambition to invade was fully exposed. The disturbances in Tianjin have not yet ended, and the poisonous flames have spread to Shanghai and Songhu. The government authorities, enduring humiliation and suffering, willingly submit. However, after a satisfactory response was given, merciless artillery fire was added. This shows that even if one bares one's shoulders and leads a sheep, one cannot avoid being slaughtered. The Japanese militarists no longer regard us as human beings. Our 19th Route Army, unable to endure it any longer, rose up to resist the enemy. For a month, together with other armies, they have fought bravely and repeatedly achieved victories. Our people have also acted swiftly and provided full support. The hearts of the people across the country are stirred, and friendly nations are moved. The brutal Japanese have repeatedly reinforced their troops but have been unable to achieve their goals. They have unleashed their cruel and bestial nature, bombing our cities and killing our civilians. In the Shanghai and Songhu areas, cultural institutions have been reduced to ashes. Inside the concessions, women and children who have fled have suffered terribly, with women in the countryside being raped and having their breasts cut off and their hands and feet severed. They playfully killed a two-year-old child by stabbing it in the stomach with a knife and dancing it in the air. All of these things have been witnessed and heard by people both in China and abroad. Our Chinese nation has reached this dead end. The only thing we can do is for everyone to have a mind of certain death and fight against this demon that is abandoned by humanity. What else is there to say? The friendly nations of Europe and America, hating the brutal Japanese militarists, their inhumane conduct, and their destruction of peace, have repeatedly warned them. We Chinese people are grateful for their profound sympathy and should encourage their courage to fight. Justice still exists in the world, and effort has its rewards. However, the irresponsible political authorities in Japan, ignoring reason, attach themselves to the militarists to make a living. They tell lies and sophistry to the international community, claiming that 'China is frequently in internal chaos and is still not suited to the organization of a modern nation.' Recently, Inukai and others sent a letter to the 'North China Daily News' to inform British dignitaries, insulting our country even more. First, they said that China has no central government, only military men in each province fighting each other. Second, they said that China has absolutely no hope and should not be pitied any longer. How should all our citizens be vigilant and indignant upon hearing these words? Know that the loss of political order is only a temporary phenomenon, but the foundation of the country lies in the unity of the people. Since the start of the Shanghai battle, all countries have been united and risen up to resist Japan. All parties are united in good faith, with no separation between the military and the civilians. Even ignorant villagers are willing to sacrifice to save the country. The heart of the people has not died, and the lifeline of the nation will last forever. Adversity strengthens the nation, as the ancient saying goes. Now that the war has begun, we do not know when it will end. We Chinese people must be prepared for a long-term struggle to win the final victory. All unhealthy thoughts such as seeking luck, harboring hope, relying on others, fearing danger, and being hypocritical should be eradicated. If you can take up arms and go to the battlefield to fight bravely against the enemy alongside armed comrades, that would be great. If you cannot, then you should fulfill your duties as citizens and follow the following four principles, encouraging each other: First, diligence. Agriculture, industry, and other direct production should be intensified to increase output so that food and clothing are continuously supplied. Other indirect production professions should also be energetic and work diligently. The unemployed should seek opportunities in the interior, whether in agriculture or industry, there is plenty of room for development, and public and private organizations should do everything possible to help them succeed. As the ancient saying goes, 'The people's livelihood lies in diligence, and diligence will not lead to poverty.' Modern people also say, 'One must labor to eat.' In this long-term struggle, to consolidate the rear and support the war, this matter is extremely important. This is the first. Second, thrift. In recent years, extravagance has become a trend. Everyone wastes things. There is no ability to produce new things, but there are new ways to consume them. The decline of society is heartbreaking to speak of. Now we should learn from the pain and be aware. Moreover, the national treasury is depleted, and military expenses are high, so we should save on food and clothing and donate the remaining money to the military, not only to show the spirit of saving the country, but also to train the will to fight. This is the second. Third, patience. The price of happiness requires corresponding sacrifices. The survival of the nation depends on its own efforts. The brave warriors defending the country have already given up their lives on the battlefield. We citizens should endure and accept any hardship. Ask yourselves, is the material loss smaller than the abandonment of life? Is the spiritual depression heavier or lighter than a lifetime of slavery? Once the balance is struck, we should grit our teeth and endure to the extreme. This is the third. Fourth, cooperation. Great things cannot be accomplished by one person, and good deeds can only be achieved through cooperation. Defending against the enemy at the front is the duty of the soldiers, and supporting them at the rear is the duty of our people. Cooperation is necessary to boost morale and consolidate the army's heart. By extension, we should also cooperate in rescuing refugees, helping the unemployed, promoting national goods, and boycotting enemy goods. In all that we can do, we should promote a spirit of mutual assistance and show brotherly love. This is the fourth. The above four points are old sayings, but if we can put them into practice with real effort, the effect will be significant. The members of our association, who are responsible for education, pledge to lead students and be cautious ourselves. We also ask all compatriots across the country to agree and go to it together. We hereby declare, respectfully hoping for your consideration." Shanghai City Education Circles National Salvation Joint Association.</p>
<h3>Rescue Work</h3>
<p>▲ Red Cross Rescue Team Departs</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, the Chinese Red Cross has organized more than 30 rescue teams, with more than 2,000 team members. They have been rescuing wounded soldiers, civilians, and refugees on the battlefield every day, numbering more than 50,000. Recently, due to the retreat of the 19th Route Army and the shift of the war to the Nanxiang area, coupled with repeated shootings by Japanese troops at the Red Cross, Shanghai stopped its work on the 3rd. All team members, filled with righteous indignation, have decided to continue working in the rear of our army. Starting from the morning of the 4th, they have been moving to Suzhou and other places. The association has telegraphed the Wu County branch to prepare everything in advance, and in addition to the existing wounded soldier hospital, it plans to set up several more.</p>
<p>▲ Song and He Organize Wounded Soldier Hospital</p>
<p>Song Qingling and He Xiangning, in view of the brave resistance of the 19th Route Army and the invasion of the brutal Japanese, and that the front line has been fighting hard for a month and many have been injured, have specially organized the National Wounded Soldier Hospital to provide relief. The hospital is located at Jiaotong University in Xujiahui.</p>
<p>▲ Hu Wenhu Donates 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Hu Wenhu, a charitable overseas Chinese from Singapore, has always cared about the motherland and paid attention to public welfare. He has readily offered help. Now that Japanese troops have attacked Shanghai, He Xiangning sent a telegram requesting donations for rescue funds. It is now known that Mr. Hu has pledged to donate 10,000 yuan, which has been remitted to Ms. He to support her rescue work.</p>
<p>▲ Life Wounded Soldier Hospital</p>
<p>The Life Weekly has been entrusted by readers to open a rear wounded soldier hospital at the YMCA Middle School in Fanwangdu. It has specially invited Dr. Wang Yijing to preside over everything. Details have been reported in previous issues. It is now known that the hospital started accepting wounded soldiers yesterday (the 4th). The chief physician, Wang Yijing, and six others, including McCugan (American), Zhong Pinzhu, Diao Qinghuan, Gao Enyang, and Gu Sikang, and many nurses, are taking turns to provide medical care. The meals for the wounded soldiers in the hospital are donated by the Tianchu Flavoring Essence Factory, 50 yuan per day, for a temporary period of one month, and then re-evaluated as needed. Ren Shigang, the manager of the Wuhe Weaving Factory, donated 1,000 eggs, and Gu Xiyuan donated many blankets to comfort the wounded soldiers. It is heard that the hospital still needs one or two operating beds, as well as medicines, cotton, gauze, and other supplies. Donations from enthusiastic people are welcome.</p>
<p>▲ Xiong Shihui Takes Care of Refugees Returning Home</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Relief Association chartered the Jianghua Wheel to transport a large number of refugees to various places along the Yangtze River for resettlement. Prior to this, the association telegraphed the provincial capitals and port military and civilian officials along the Yangtze River, asking them to send police to take care of the refugees when the ship arrived, and to distribute relief and set up shelters. Yesterday, the association received a reply from Xiong Shihui, the chairman of Jiangxi, stating: "Shanghai War Zone Refugee Relief Association, your esteemed letter is acknowledged. Your telegrams one, two, and three have been received and noted. I have telegraphed the Jiujiang Garrison Headquarters and the county government to investigate and handle the matter and report back. I hereby reply. Xiong Shihui, Jiang."</p>
<p>▲ Guangzhou Guanghua Rescue Team Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Guanghua Medical College National Salvation Rescue Team in Guangzhou has long been famous in Guangdong. When the Northeast Incident occurred, the team originally wanted to go to the war zone, but was prevented by circumstances. Unexpectedly, the sound of artillery in the Northeast had not yet ceased, and the sound of artillery in the Shanghai case was heard again. Therefore, the team sent out its first team to Shanghai on the 28th of last month, arriving in Shanghai yesterday on the President Lincoln. The team has a total of 40 members, including six doctors, twenty-two medical interns, and twenty-two nurses, led by Dr. Hui Entao. Upon arrival, the team was received by Yan Fuqing of the Red Cross General Hospital and the Guangzhao Public Association. They are currently staying at the Da Jiangnan Hotel on Shilu Road and sent people to work at the Jiang Red Cross Hospital on Yidingpan Road last night. It is said that the entire team moved to the Zhongxi Women's College this morning to carry out rescue work.</p>

<p>The Anhui-Ningguo Shanghai Fellow Villagers' Association, in addition to sending people</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>permanently stationed at the Joint Office of Shanghai Fellow Villagers' Associations to discuss relief, has also negotiated methods with the Hangzhou Fellow Villagers' Association regarding sending fellow villagers back to their hometowns. The number of people sent in recent days has been very large. Anhui-Ningguo fellow villagers who have been victimized and want to return home can register at the association and receive a certificate, which will allow them to be sent back home free of charge. The association has now been ordered by the Social Bureau to investigate the disaster situation. Yesterday, it published a notice in the newspaper, asking the victimized fellow villagers to report to the association as soon as possible, so that it can compile statistics as a basis for future negotiations for compensation.</p>
<h3>Condolence Messages</h3>
<p>▲ Philippine Overseas Chinese Continue Unremitting Remittances</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Situation in Nanshi</h3>
<p>▲The Situation Is Still Good, But Theft Is Rampant</p>
<p>The Shanghai South District Defense Corps, deeply concerned about the potential for disorder in the area and the risk of bandits taking advantage to loot and plunder, has not only instructed its subordinate teams to strengthen their defenses but also, starting yesterday, mobilized corps members to form patrol teams. These teams, divided into groups of ten, with two members carrying broadswords and the rest armed with firearms, and one person in front carrying a flag bearing the words "Shanghai South District Defense Corps Patrol Team No. ○," have been continuously patrolling the urban and suburban areas of Nanshi throughout the day. Furthermore, while the situation in Nanshi was generally good yesterday, people remained fearful, and some continued to relocate. However, the public security police have been concentrated in one location at night, unlike their previous scattered deployments, leading to a surge in theft. The previous night, five or six homes were burglarized in the Meixie Road and Xieqiao areas, and over ten cases involved tunneling or breaking down doors to enter and steal. Fortunately, many residents had evacuated, so the losses were not significant.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Wounded Soldiers Management Committee</h3>
<p>▲Aims to Prevent Unhealed Soldiers from Returning to the Front Lines</p>
<p>Since the Japanese military's unprovoked invasion of Zhabei on January 28th, the 19th Route Army, garrisoning Shanghai, immediately rose up to fight in defense of national territory and repeatedly repulsed the enemy's advance. However, the Japanese side has repeatedly changed commanders and dispatched reinforcements, reaching over 100,000 troops. The newly appointed Japanese Commander-in-Chief, Shirakawa, also launched a sneak attack on Liuhang, forcing our army to order a general retreat due to the unfavorable circumstances. Upon hearing this news, the wounded soldiers in various hospitals all wept bitterly and pleaded with the hospital directors to allow them to return to their units and engage in a final battle with the Japanese invaders. Some even feigned illness to go out and secretly return to their units, numbering over a hundred people. Fan Qiwu, Director of the 19th Route Army Rear Office, believing that these wounded soldiers were courageous, dedicated, and willing to sacrifice for the country, yet recognizing that their injuries were not fully healed and hasty combat would not serve the cause of preserving strength, specifically appointed Zhan Baoguang, a major staff officer of the General Headquarters, and Ban Gan, an adjutant from the 5th Army Headquarters, to the rear to organize a Wounded Soldiers Management Committee. The purpose of this committee is to prevent any wounded soldiers whose injuries are not fully healed from returning to their units for combat. It is reported that the committee has selected No. 5 Zilai Street as its headquarters, with one chairman and one vice-chairman, and twenty members. The organization is divided into three sections: General Affairs, Management, and Finance, each with a section chief. The list of selected personnel is as follows: Chairman Zhan Baoguang, Vice-Chairman Ban Gan, General Affairs Section Chief Zheng Feng, Management Section Chief Yu Huixun, and Finance Section Chief Xu Shiquan. The members already decided are Tao Junruo, Yu Huixun, Zheng Feng, Zhao Yangtian, Zhai Hao, Niu Huisheng, Pang Jingzhou, Yan Fugin, Rui Qingrong, Wang Jing, Xue Xueling, Wang Peiyuan, and twelve others. The remaining eight members will be appointed by various division headquarters and are expected to arrive at the committee for work within days.</p>

<p>The Special District Citizens' United Association, deeply concerned about the refugees fleeing from the military's withdrawn areas to the concessions, filling the roads and enduring the hardships of sleeping in the open, sent a letter to the Local Maintenance Association requesting assistance in providing shelter. The association replied yesterday that it was already seeking housing to accommodate as many people as possible. The exchange of letters is recorded below: (Citizen's Association Letter) Dear Sirs, Since our troops moved their defense lines, compatriots from the withdrawn areas, fearing the Japanese army's brutal killings, have been fleeing into the concessions in large numbers, bringing the old and the young. Those without anywhere to go are mostly sleeping by the roadside, a truly pitiful sight. Our association is deeply saddened and eager to help but lacks the resources. Considering that your association was established to maintain local order, it should not stand idly by in the face of this tragedy. We request that you quickly find ways to provide shelter or dispersal to avoid the risk of freezing and starvation. If our association's manpower is needed, we will not hesitate to offer our assistance. We respectfully inform you of this and hope for your consideration. Respectfully, To the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association. (Maintenance Association Reply) Dear Sirs, We have received your letter, and we deeply appreciate your concern. With the National Army retreating, the rear areas need to be maintained urgently. The number of refugees has suddenly increased, and most shelters are full, and there are few empty houses available.

<h3>All Sectors Should Prevent Epidemics</h3>
<p>A letter from "A Survivor" states: "To the Editor, Shanghai has not seen snow in winter, nor rain in spring. Furthermore, the great fires in Zhabei and Jiangwan have raged continuously, day and night, making the weather extremely arid. Consequently, smallpox and diphtheria are prevalent in the city. With the recent surge in the concession's population, an epidemic is feared if these diseases spread. As the saying goes, 'After a disaster of war, there will surely be a year of famine.' Feeling concerned, I dare not remain silent. I hope your esteemed newspaper will provide space to broadly announce this, so that all sectors will pay attention and take precautions. This would be fortunate for the people and for society." Respectfully submitted by "A Survivor."</p>

He was later arrested by the police and handed over to the First Special District Local Court, where he was tried and sentenced to death. The court has now received instructions from higher authorities to execute the prisoner by hanging. Yesterday morning, the police were ordered to dispatch detectives to the Western Prison to bring Wang Songfa to the court. Judge Wu presided over the proceedings and asked if he had any last words. The prisoner remained stubborn and stated that he did not fear death.

The Public Works Department specifically dispatched lawyers Ru Bao-yi and Gan Jingxian to the scene to supervise the execution.</p>
<h3>The Truth of Sun Ameng's Tragic Death</h3>
<p>This newspaper reported yesterday that a tramp was run over and killed by a Shanghai-Minhang bus, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. According to the investigation, the deceased, Sun Ameng, a native of Pudong, 30 years old, was a turtle seller in Xujiahui. On the afternoon of February 29th, he carried 112 yuan in cash and went to the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance bus to Nanhang to buy goods. Because the car was crowded at the time, he immediately boarded the roof of the car. When the car reached Qianliang Temple Station, he was smoking and somehow set fire to his bedding. The wind fanned the flames, causing a fire. At that time, the deceased screamed for help because the fire had burned his lower body, but the car was moving very fast, and the engine was roaring, so neither the driver nor the passengers in the car could hear him. Later, they felt the roof of the car shaking from side to side and realized that something was wrong. They immediately stopped the car and saw that the roof was on fire. The deceased was rolling around on the roof, and they rescued him. However, his lower body had already been burned. He was sent to Minhang Hospital for treatment. After the doctor gave him an emergency injection, the deceased was able to speak. He immediately told his address and all the details. He died in the hospital that evening due to serious injuries. The Shanghai-Minhang Bus Company sent a letter to Qiu Akun, who was doing business with the deceased in Xujiahui. Qiu Akun then informed the deceased's family. The deceased's body has now been claimed by his family.</p>

<p>Domestic and Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>League of Nations Special Meeting to Discuss Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>Yan Huiqing Declares Ceasefire Negotiations Broken Down</p>
<p>China Cannot Accept Japanese Ceasefire Conditions</p>
<p>Only Continue Resisting Japanese Aggression</p>
<p>Necessary Conditions for Participating in Round Table Conference</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Must Withdraw from Post-War Occupied Areas</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the League of Nations General Assembly reconvened this afternoon, the Chinese representative Yan Huiqing immediately declared that the Shanghai ceasefire negotiations had broken down and that hostilities would continue. Earlier this morning, hopes for a ceasefire were high, and the chaotic situation seemed to be clearing up slightly. Yan's announcement of the breakdown of negotiations was like a bolt of lightning, silencing the entire room and creating a palpable tension. Yan continued his speech with激昂and indignation, detailing the basic conditions for a ceasefire proposed by Japan, saying that they fundamentally overturned the understanding reached on the British warship HMS Kent and were absolutely unacceptable to China. He stated that their harshness was equivalent to China's complete surrender, so the Chinese people felt that there was no other way but to continue resisting Japanese aggression, and recognized that the prolongation of hostilities was unavoidable. He also stated that China demanded that Japanese troops withdraw from the area from which the 19th Route Army had voluntarily retreated. This was a necessary condition for China's participation in a round table conference. Finally, he repeatedly requested the invocation of Article 15 of the Covenant and the implementation of a ceasefire in accordance with the outline proposed by British Admiral Sir Taylor. After the Chinese representative finished speaking, the Japanese representative Sato followed to read a long telegram sent from Shanghai, strongly arguing that Japan was fighting in self-defense, that the sole motivation for all actions taken under duress was to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents and the Public and French Concessions, and falsely accused China of constant internal turmoil, which posed a permanent threat to all foreign interests. He then detailed the Shanghai incident, attempting to defend the Japanese navy's bombing of civilian areas in Zhabei, calling it necessary due to the circumstances. Finally, he also stated that the Shanghai ceasefire negotiations had been extended to Friday morning and refused to allow the General Assembly to discuss the Manchurian incident. Tonight, opinions within the League of Nations recognize the situation as unprecedentedly tense, but hope that there may be significant changes within the next 24 hours, otherwise the League of Nations will face a problem that could lead to its own demise.

<h3>Belgian Foreign Minister Elected President</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly, specially convened to address the East Asian issue, met this morning. Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans was elected president of the special assembly with 45 votes (out of the total number of votes). After a brief speech by Hymans, the election of vice-presidents was held. Before the vote, the president declared that the representatives of China and Japan had both voluntarily given up their candidacies for the position of vice-president. Eight vice-presidents were elected (see yesterday's newspaper). The meeting adjourned at 1:30 PM and reconvened for a second session at 4:30 PM after a meeting of the presidium at 3:30 PM. President Hymans declared that a general affairs committee would be formed with representatives from all countries to study the entire issue and prepare a report to be submitted to the General Assembly. The chairman then invited Yan Huiqing to speak, and the entire room applauded in welcome.</p>
<h3>Yan Huiqing's Passionate Speech</h3>
<p>Yan's speech began, immediately astonishing the entire room. This was because the news received in the meeting this morning was that Japan had already agreed to a ceasefire, which greatly pleased them. Yan's report was the opposite of what was expected. Yan said briefly, "The Shanghai ceasefire negotiations have now broken down. China notified the Secretariat this morning. I feel deeply sorry to have to report this matter to the General Assembly. The terms of the ceasefire agreed upon on the British flagship HMS Kent were for both sides to immediately withdraw their troops simultaneously. China accepted these terms on the same day, but Japan did not respond. Suddenly, the next day, it launched a large-scale attack, forcing the Chinese army to retreat to the second defense line. On the evening of March 2nd, Japan notified Admiral Kelly of the ceasefire terms, the content of which was equivalent to completely overturning the proposal agreed upon on the HMS Kent. The Japanese ceasefire terms have been notified to the League of Nations. Yan read the full text to the public, saying that this kind of proposal was tantamount to making China surrender, which China could never accept. Hostilities have now begun again." Yan said that since the conflict broke out on its territory, China has entrusted the resolution of this matter to the League of Nations. China declared that it was prepared to accept all peaceful solutions that the Executive Yuan could adopt. Yan also described the reasons why China requested the convening of a special assembly, the detailed process of the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents, and the resolutions of the Executive Yuan, one by one, and commented on the report of the Shanghai Consular Investigation Team. Finally, he made the following conclusions: "(1) Japan despises the Executive Yuan. The resolutions passed by the Executive Yuan on September 30th and December 10th of last year, which Japan had approved, have been completely rendered ineffective by Japan's use of military force. This is very clear. (2) Japan's violation of the League of Nations Covenant is beyond doubt. If occupying 200,000 square miles of territory and sending 100,000 troops to Shanghai does not constitute aggression, then where should the boundaries of non-aggressive behavior be drawn according to the Covenant? (3) Japan's rejection of arbitration and engagement in armed force is a violation of the Paris Pact for the Renunciation of War. (4) The League of Nations cannot ignore the violation of the Nine-Power Treaty, as the preamble of the Covenant states that all member states have the responsibility to strictly observe all obligations and treaties in their mutual relations. We are meeting today, at a time when China is being ravaged by Japan, and a part of its territory, an area equal in size to the combined territories of France and Germany, is now under the trampling hooves of the aggressor. Nanjing, the capital of our country, was bombarded without cause, and Shanghai, the commercial hub of the Far East, was also bombed by enemy shells, as dense as a rainstorm. Other villages, towns, and cities have all been subjected to the most violent aerial bombardment. For example, Suzhou and Hangzhou were recently bombed by enemy aircraft dropping huge tonnages of bombs, resulting in the deaths of more than 7,000 civilians. Civilized people around the world will be outraged when they hear of this. Under these circumstances, the joint mediation efforts of various countries have failed. We should frankly admit this. Otherwise, we would be simply denying the facts and betraying our conscience. The Executive Yuan's requests to stop hostilities and withdraw the invading troops have all been in vain. Japan has repeatedly made promises to the Executive Yuan, but has always broken its word. The Executive Yuan has advised Japan to respect its national honor, and has also endorsed the United States' declaration that any situation or fact created by methods that violate the League of Nations Covenant, the Pact for the Renunciation of War, and the Nine-Power Treaty cannot be recognized as legitimate. The results of all these actions are equal to zero. At present, Japan's attitude is as resolute as it was at the beginning of the incident. Its declaration in response to the request from the Committee of Twelve is a clear rejection of the League of Nations' intervention. The declaration states that Japan has not issued any effective promises that can bind Japan so that it cannot comply with the League of Nations' requirements. It also states that, from a spiritual point of view, Japan's judgment of the facts must naturally be more appropriate than that of any other distant country. Its words are so aggressive. Not only that, China has entrusted this case to the League of Nations without reservation, advocating for the application of the League of Nations' proposed</p>

<h3>Continued Reception of Domestic and Foreign Important Telegrams</h3>
<p>peaceful solutions, including so-called arbitration and judicial resolution, have all been rejected by Japan. China is prepared, after the withdrawal of Japanese troops, to have international assistance assume full responsibility for protecting the interests of Japanese residents, but Japan refuses to withdraw its troops. The peace plan proposed by the four member states of the League of Nations and the United States has also been fully accepted by China, but Japan does not recognize the main provisions of the plan. According to the report of the Shanghai Consular Investigation Team established by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, a state of war already exists, and the attacks are entirely in the hands of the Japanese. From the above, it is clear how right and wrong are distinguished from each other. What China wants to request from the League of Nations is: (1) that the Special Assembly of the League of Nations, which is handling all disputes between China and Japan, research the issue in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant, and do its best to find a solution; (2) that the Assembly, to the extent of its authority, first stop all hostilities on Chinese territory and allow the invading troops to withdraw, and then resolve all disputes between China and Japan in a peaceful manner within the scope of the Executive Yuan's resolutions and in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant; any solution regarding Shanghai or Manchuria that harms China's sovereignty, violates the general principles of international law, or violates China's treaty obligations to third countries should not be considered a solution; (3) that the Assembly recognize that the League of Nations Covenant has been violated; (4) that the Assembly seriously declare that China bears no responsibility for the tragic situation in Manchuria, Shanghai, and other cities in China; after the Assembly makes this declaration, it should immediately begin its spiritual mobilization, because we firmly believe that only this kind of mobilization can resolve this conflict; China is indeed an innocent victim of aggression, but we can declare that we have never harbored any hatred for the Japanese people, even during today's fighting, because what we are requesting is the peace and justice stipulated by the Covenant.</p>
<h3>Japanese Representative Conceals Ambitions</h3>
<p>Following the presentation of Japan's viewpoint by Japanese representative Matsudaira, he first publicly announced telegrams received from commanders Shiozawa and Nomura. These telegrams stated that at 2:00 PM today, Japanese troops had received orders to cease all combat operations, with the exception of instances of hostile actions by Chinese troops. Matsudaira then stated that Japan, as a member of the League of Nations and the Administrative Council, participated in this special assembly with deep regret. The reason for convening this special assembly was precisely because a dispute had arisen between Japan and another member state, with the hope of resolving it. However, Japan did not desire the convening of this assembly. The reason for initiating this meeting was that Japan, in view of the situation in Shanghai, had no choice but to take defensive measures to protect Japanese residents from extreme and imminent dangers. The Public Concession was also something Japan wished to protect, as a section within the Concession was defended by Japan. Therefore, once a method to avert the danger was found, the matter could be naturally concluded. Matsudaira described the Shanghai Incident and explained Japan's attitude towards the matter. The reasons he presented were entirely consistent with the memorandum submitted by Japan this morning. Matsudaira also stated that the Japanese commander in Shanghai declared this morning that combat appeared to have ceased, so that Chinese troops could withdraw beyond the area originally demanded by Japan. According to the information he had just received, the Chinese and Japanese authorities had originally planned to reconvene at 2:00 PM this afternoon, but at the request of the Chinese, it had been postponed until tomorrow morning. At this point, Matsudaira stated that he wished to clearly declare Japan's view on Shanghai to the assembly, namely: (1) If the dangers threatening Japanese residents and the danger threatening the Public Concession section defended by Japan can be avoided, then Japan is prepared to immediately cease hostile actions, and the Japanese army will withdraw from the Shanghai area once peace and tranquility are restored. (2) Japan is prepared to participate in a round table conference with relevant countries to study methods of protecting the rights and interests of all relevant countries. (3) Japan has no intention of exploiting the current situation to pursue political and territorial ambitions or obtain exclusive benefits in the Shanghai area. Japan is very willing to accept the proposal of Peng Gu, chairman of the Administrative Council, on February 29th. Earnest efforts are now being made in Shanghai to ensure that hostile actions can be effectively stopped, but until this goal is achieved, the Chinese troops have already retreated. As for the Manchurian question, Japan believes it should not be discussed at this assembly. However, since the Chinese representative had made a lengthy explanation on the Manchurian question, the speaker would briefly reiterate a portion of Foreign Minister Yoshizawa's speech to the Diet on January 21st of this year. Yoshizawa said that Manchuria is the key to peace in the Far East, and Japan is doing everything possible to prevent the Chinese civil war from spreading to Manchuria, as it is in Japan's interest to maintain peace in Manchuria. Therefore, Manchuria relies on Japan's power to become a land of peace and prosperity. Matsudaira also stated that Japan has absolutely no territorial ambitions in Manchuria, and that the principles of open door and equal opportunity, as well as various treaties relating to the area, should be respected and maintained. Japan is currently awaiting the results of the work of the League of Nations-appointed Manchuria Investigation Commission. Since this matter is being actively pursued and does not appear likely to fail, it is not necessary to bring it up again at this time, otherwise the solution that we all earnestly hope for may be hindered. Finally, Matsudaira stated that the current entanglement is actually the result of an accumulation of many unfortunate past events. We sincerely hope that Sino-Japanese relations can be peacefully resolved and that dangerous storms can be eliminated forever. After the Japanese representative's speech, the chairman of the assembly announced that the matter would be handed over to the General Committee for review at its meeting at 3:30 PM tomorrow. No general discussion would be held. The meeting was adjourned at 8:00 PM. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>General Committee Formed</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After hearing the statements from various parties regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, the League of Nations Council will commence work this afternoon. A General Committee has been formed to conduct frank discussions. The committee is scheduled to meet at 4:00 PM, and British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon and others will deliver speeches at that time. The Chinese chief delegate, Dr. Yen, has requested the League of Nations Council to declare that Japan has violated the League of Nations Covenant. It is the general opinion that the Council will not make such a significant judgment, as such a move would naturally lead to various serious consequences. The non-participation of the United States and other non-League of Nations members in the General Committee is sufficient to dispel rumors that the League of Nations will persuade Russia and the United States to join in cooperation. However, the League of Nations Administrative Council is constantly in contact with the US delegation to the Disarmament Conference. Members of this delegation are observing the proceedings in the gallery of the League of Nations Council. There is now hope that the United States may endorse any resolution passed by the League of Nations Council. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>

(2) Warning China to respect the treaty rights of the powers. (3) Urgently advising both parties to engage in genuine and lasting peace negotiations. (4) Thanking the United States and other countries with interests in the Far East for their mediation of the Shanghai Round Table Conference. (5) Fully approving the Council's handling of the Sino-Japanese dispute since last September. (6) Specifically approving the dispatch of an investigative committee and requesting a swift resolution of the Shanghai Incident to facilitate the committee's work. (7) Requesting the Council to prepare a comprehensive report on the Sino-Japanese dispute to be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly regular session in September.

<h3>Luo Wengan Reports on Diplomacy with Japan</h3>
<p>Regarding Humiliating Conditions</p>
<p>Strict Rejection of Everything</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Luo received reporters at 11:00 AM on the 4th to discuss China's completely justified defensive stance against Japan's aggression in Shanghai. Therefore, on the one hand, it is military self-defense, and on the other hand, mediation by friendly countries is not rejected. The friendly good offices of various friendly nations have been offered more than once, but in the end, because the Japanese side lacked sincerity, nothing was achieved. On February 28, representatives from both China and Japan held an informal meeting on a British flagship stationed in Shanghai and agreed on five basic conditions. China indicated its acceptance the following day, but the Japanese side ultimately did not respond. Moreover, under an atmosphere of mediation, the Japanese side launched a large-scale offensive. For strategic reasons, our troops retreated to the second line of defense. The Japanese side then presented our side with four so-called basic conditions for an immediate cessation of hostilities on the evening of the 2nd of this month, which differed greatly from the five basic conditions reached between the two sides on February 28. In the past two days, British Minister Lampson and British Admiral Kelly invited representatives from both China and Japan to discuss the good offices of a third party. Our country is willing to give sincere consideration to these, but will strictly reject any conditions that harm national sovereignty and territory or insult the national dignity. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan told reporters that British Minister and Admiral Kelly invited Gu Weijun to the ship on the 3rd to discuss peaceful resolutions with the Japanese representatives. The Japanese put forward four terms, which Gu considered unacceptable. This is because the National Government had previously resolved that, no matter how the situation changes, it would never accept terms that would lose power and insult the country. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Yan Huiqing about the two winter rivers, stating that our country's complete resistance was not a declaration of war, so it repeatedly tolerated the mediation of the British Charge d'Affaires England and British Minister Lampson and Admiral Kelly's contact with the Japanese side. The Japanese repeatedly refused, and the fault lies with the Japanese side. On the 2nd, Japan agreed to accept the armistice terms, requesting instructions from the government, and at the same time invaded with heavy troops, then the responsibility is even more obvious. They hoped to report the truth to the General Assembly and were willing to accept the judgment of world justice. (Special Dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Japan Vigorously Seeking Round Table Conference</h3>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japanese Attention to League of Nations and American Actions</h3>
<p>Japanese newspapers every day reported on the 3rd, a Tokyo United News dispatch, stating that the situation at the League of Nations special general assembly on the 3rd was unusually chaotic. The Chinese representative, Yan Huiqing, presented to the League of Nations a note severing diplomatic relations, while also including the Manchurian issue for joint resolution. Our representative (Japan) consistently and resolutely opposed this, stating that the Shanghai incident was originally not a war and was a local issue. Subsequently, the League of Nations suddenly received an urgent report of continued attacks by the Japanese military, and the atmosphere in the meeting immediately became tense. Therefore, the future situation for Japan is not optimistic, and so on.</p>
<p>The Japanese newspaper "Nichinichi Shimbun" carried a Tokyo Mitsui United News dispatch, stating that the United States dispatched its entire Atlantic fleet to the Pacific, with nine ships stationed at its base in Java, conducting a large-scale naval exercise. The remaining ships have already been appropriately deployed. The U.S. Navy Department, in order to participate in the exercise, also arrived in Santiago yesterday. Although the exercise is scheduled to be completed on March 23, the ships will return to their original locations. However, there has been no announcement regarding the reasons for the movement of the warships, which is something we should pay attention to, and so on.</p>
<p>External Note to Various Countries</p>
<h3>Cease Japanese Aircraft Harassment of Suzhou</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of hostilities in Shanghai, Japanese aircraft have repeatedly harassed Suzhou. Recently, Japanese aircraft opened fire and dropped bombs in the vicinity of the Suzhou airfield. The Wu County government immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Provincial Government, requesting serious negotiations with the Japanese side. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on a letter from the Aviation Administration, requested a cessation of Japanese aircraft activity over Suzhou. The Ministry has lodged a protest with Japan and notified the British and American ambassadors. The text of the notification reads: "According to reliable reports, Japanese aircraft have flown over Suzhou a total of eight times, flying two or three times a day, with two or three aircraft or five or six aircraft each time, either circling around or hovering over the new airfield outside Fengmen. On the morning of the 18th, Japanese aircraft even opened fire with machine guns outside Fengmen, which is illegal. Please protest to the Japanese side and promptly cease this activity, and declare that if Japanese aircraft engage in such behavior in the future, we will take necessary actions in order to ensure legitimate self-defense, etc. The Japanese army, navy, and air force, disregarding international law, international conventions, and the League of Nations Administrative Council's repeated resolutions to prevent the expansion of the incident, have groundlessly attacked Shanghai, a Chinese international commercial center, and recently dispatched multiple aircraft to repeatedly hover over Suzhou and other places, and have even opened fire with machine guns. These illegal actions clearly threaten the vicinity of Shanghai and seek to further expand the situation. Although China has consistently adhered to the Administrative Council's resolution not to expand the incident, if Japanese aircraft continue to engage in such actions while the situation in Shanghai remains tense, China will have no choice but to take emergency defensive measures. We hereby lodge a serious protest with Your Excellency and request that you promptly inform your government to seriously restrain Japanese aircraft from engaging in such actions, so as to avoid expanding the situation. We hope that you will investigate and respond accordingly."</p>
<h3>Ding Chao Leads Troops to Attack Harbin</h3>
<p>▲The Vanguard Reaches Mao'er Mountain</p>
<p>▲Zhao Zhixiang Also Rises Up to Resist Japan</p>
<p>▲Wang Delin Occupies Dunhua City</p>
<p>Harbin dispatch: The Self-Defense Army under Ding Chao, on February 5th, under the pressure of overwhelming Japanese artillery fire, retreated once to the Hu-Hai railway, concentrating in Hulan County. Another branch of the force, led by Gong Zhanhai and Feng Zhanhai, retreated to the vicinity of Hengdaogou and Feketu Town on the Eastern China Railway Harbin-Suifenhe Line on the 9th and 10th of February, and actively reorganized. Initially, they planned to join forces with Ma Zhanshan to counterattack, but Ma surrendered to the Japanese and went to become the Chairman of Heilongjiang.</p>
<p>Ding Chao then led his troops from Hulan to Bayan County in eastern Heilongjiang. On the 18th, Japanese aircraft flew to the county and dropped more than 20 bombs, destroying several shops in the west gate and injuring soldiers and pedestrians. On the 19th, they continued to drop bombs, killing six soldiers and injuring more than 20. Therefore, Ding determined that his troops could not be stationed in the area and detoured to Tongbin County. Separately, Commander-in-Chief Wang Zhiyou rushed to Hengdaogou, supervised Gong Zhanhai's brigade, transferred Feng Zhanhai's troops, and advanced westward along the eastern line. On the 20th, they occupied Weihe and Zhuhe counties. The 28th Brigade's Liu Zuobin Regiment, stationed in Zhuhe, had already accepted the puppet commission of Qi Xi. Hearing of the arrival of the Self-Defense Army, they collapsed without a fight, and more than 800 of their men were disarmed and incorporated into the Self-Defense Army. At 9 a.m. on the 21st, Wang Zhiyou led his troops towards Yimianpo, occupying the area that day. The garrison of the 2nd Garrison Brigade of Qi Xi's army, stationed there, consisting of about 2,000 newly recruited bandits, also collapsed and retreated. After the Self-Defense Army entered the town, they established a general headquarters. On the 22nd, Feng Zhanhai's vanguard continued to advance. The Japanese army stationed in Harbin, hearing the news, became quite alarmed and dispatched two aircraft to reconnoiter. At Wujimi River, they encountered the Self-Defense Army and dropped several bombs, none of which hit. The Self-Defense Army immediately dismantled that section of the railway, halting their advance. After scouting and finding no obstacles ahead, they advanced again on the 23rd, arriving at Mao'er Mountain at noon, only 140 li from Harbin. On that day, the general Han traitors in Harbin and the Japanese army were greatly alarmed. Merchants, hearing the news, rushed to close their doors. The streets were filled with Japanese soldiers on patrol. The Japanese residential area on Duanjie Street was still piled with sandbags and hung with iron nets, guarded by reserve soldiers. The situation was extremely tense for a time. At 1 p.m., Zhao Yi's Self-Defense Army appeared at Huangshanzui, 30 li east of Harbin, creating the impression that they were about to enter Harbin. The Japanese were even more panicked. At 2 p.m., Japanese Commander Hasegawa dispatched more than 800 Japanese soldiers to assist the 1st Garrison Brigade in blocking Zhao Yi's troops at Huangshanzui. He also deployed 1,000 Japanese soldiers to Acheng on the eastern line to block the advance of the Self-Defense Army, while urgently telegraphing Changchun for reinforcements. The Japanese troops who went to Huangshanzui opened fire on the Self-Defense Army on the evening of the 23rd, engaging in fierce fighting for several hours. At dawn on the 24th, the Japanese army had suffered hundreds of casualties. The Self-Defense Army suddenly received orders to retreat to Bin County, so Zhao Yi's troops ceased their attack and retreated. Around noon, a regiment of Japanese reinforcements from Changchun arrived in Harbin and transferred eastward to reinforce. Qi Xi's newly appointed East China Railway Protection Commander Yu Shenwei also led a large contingent of troops to Harbin to take over. After disembarking, his troops also transferred to Acheng. Fighting had already broken out between Xiaolingzi and Erdaohaozi on the eastern line. Qi Xi's army under Liu Yushu was surrounded by the Self-Defense Army and was reportedly under artillery attack. The Japanese army in Acheng was heading to the front to provide assistance. Three Japanese aircraft also flew from Harbin to assist in the attack. However, the eastern region is mountainous, and the Self-Defense Army, taking advantage of the terrain, should be safe. This counterattack by the Self-Defense Army was apparently well-planned. Li Du was replenishing his troops in Yilan. He and Ding Chao divided their forces to take Harbin. The 21st Brigade under Zhao Zhixiang in Suifenhe also acted in concert with Ding and Li. There was also a National Salvation Army of about 2,000 men, led by Wang Delin, formerly of the 27th Brigade stationed in Jilin, who attacked Yanbian. Their detachment had already occupied the county seat of Dunhua. On the 21st, they engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. The Jilin-Dunhua road was already impassable. The Japanese army was dispatching a regiment from Changchun to reinforce. It was also reported that over 40,000 Russian troops suddenly advanced to the Hunchun border, along with more than 300 aircraft. The Japanese side paid even more attention to this and dispatched a team to the area. (February 24th)</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Arrives in Taiyuan</h3>
<p>▲Immediately Assumes Office as Taiyuan Pacification Commissioner</p>
<p>Taiyuan dispatch: The newly appointed Taiyuan Pacification Commissioner, Yan Xishan, accompanied by his staff, arrived in Taiyuan from Hebian at 6:30 a.m. on the 27th. Local key personnel were not informed in advance. Only after Yan departed did Hebian telephone the Yan military and government authorities in Taiyuan. As Yan's car passed the Minsheng Machinery Factory, Steel Plant, Smokeless Powder Factory, and Ordnance Repair Shop south of the Fen River, dozens or hundreds of workers at each location applauded to welcome him. Yan returned their greetings. He disembarked at Binggong Road. Local welcoming personnel gathered on the side of the road to welcome him. Key personnel from various agencies who came to welcome him included former President of the Control Yuan Zhao Cilong, Provincial Chairman Xu Yongchang, Central Committee member Zhao Zhiqing, Anti-Banditry Commissioner Yang Aiyuan, Co-Commissioner Sun Chu, 68th Division Commander Li Fuying, Garrison Commander Rong Dongyu, Provincial Business Cooperative Chairman Chen Zhizhuang, Provincial Secretary-General Wang Ping, Chief Secretary Wang Qian, 70th Division Commander Wang Jingguo, Bingzhou College President Yang Tairong, Civil Affairs Director-General Meng Yuanwen, Public Security Bureau Director Wang Xifu, as well as Xu Yiqing, Kong Geng, and representatives from various parties, numbering several dozen. When Yan arrived at the station, they all stepped forward to greet him. Yan thanked them one by one and made a speech. He then got into a car and went directly to his former headquarters in the north. The key personnel also followed in cars. They went to the Beimen tea house and then ordered the provincial government to assemble in the fourth science department's cloth hall to hold an inauguration ceremony that day. Afterwards, the key personnel went to the ritual hall to wait. Yan, accompanied by Zhao Cilong, Xu Yongchang, Zhao Zhiqing, and others, arrived at the scene. Yan took his place and performed the ceremony. He then gave a short speech as follows: "I relinquished my military and political responsibilities almost a year ago. I thought that in this year, I could recuperate physically and hide my shortcomings spiritually. I was unwilling to take on responsibilities again, but because the country is in crisis, and I was urged by colleagues in the central government and pressed by elders and people from all walks of life in Shanxi and Suiyuan, I had no choice but to work hard to shoulder the responsibility of pacifying Shanxi and Suiyuan, to fulfill a part of my responsibility to the country, and to seek long-term peace and stability for the region. I think this responsibility of pacification, from the positive side, is to stabilize the region, and from the opposite side, it is to remove all obstacles to construction. Because without regional stability, all construction is impossible. This responsibility is very great. I hope that all my colleagues in Shanxi and Suiyuan will understand this and work together to live up to the trust of the country and the expectations of the people. If the country needs our soldiers to sacrifice in the future, I will lead my armed comrades to sacrifice together to fulfill my duty as a soldier." He then sent out a telegram reporting his inauguration. After the inauguration, representatives from various circles who had come to welcome Yan and advocate resistance against Japan came to request an audience and put forward three demands: (1) Please Yan immediately lead the Shanxi-Suiyuan army to resist Japan and recover the lost territories in the Northeast. (2) Rectify the provincial currency and alleviate the suffering of the people of Shanxi. (3) Transfer the stationed troops and reduce the burden on the people of Shanxi. Yan answered them one by one, expressing his willingness to actively work towards these goals. The representatives, hearing this, happily withdrew. He then received Lu Xiuwen, Deputy Commander of the 29th Army, and Qin Hanqing, representative of Song Zheyuan, as well as newspaper reporters. It is said that Yan will not go to Luoyang for the time being. (February 28th)</p>
