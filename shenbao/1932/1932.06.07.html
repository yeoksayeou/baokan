<h3 id="c1">中國徵信所創立感言 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>彬</p>
<p>最近銀行界爲溝通工商業與銀行業。扶助民旗工商業發展。特創設中國徵信所。此種事業。在我國尙爲初創。輿論對此。屬望頗切。認爲深關我國工商業之前途。吾人蓋亦有此同感。</p>
<p>徵信所之宣言有曰。「年來工商業因資本薄弱。缺少接濟。以致奄一息艱於發展。而内地災害頻仍。萑苻遍野遂使農村衰落。現金集中都市二其於</p>
<p>我國之凋敝情况及金融業之畸形狀態。誠言之育切。工商業以資本　弱而奄奄一息。金融業復以坐擁鉅資無法消納而深苦膨脹此種極端矛之現象。或即定所以說明過去金融家對於民族工商業未盡絲元毫扶植之責任檢視二十年度中國銀行之業務報告資産金額爲八萬四千六百二十一萬餘元其於工業之放欵則爲三千三百六十七萬四千餘元又二十年度上海商業儲蓄銀行營業報告資産金額爲一萬一千六百十一萬餘元對於國貨工業之押放欵則爲二千三百萬餘元。以此兩行爲例當可推知其餘然年來我國絲廠業陷入絶境金融家如具有遠大之眼光。如計及民族工商業之前途。力予扶植。蓋爲應盡之責任。但事實上去年上海各絲廠二萬九千部絲車存繭約一萬擔。概抵押於金融機關内仍無以挽救絲業崩　之刧運則視此就可徵金融家對於工商業不僅無遠大之計劃不僅未能利用膨脹之現金發展工商業。反之。且恰用極高利率之債權。以吞没垂斃之工商業。於工商業然。於農業亦然農民之典押田産或靑苗以及種種農産品承受銀行錢莊以及銀行之代理人極高利率之貸欵爲極普遍之現象此種現象又正所以吸收農民之血汗輸送至城市而使農村更日益崩潰破落。但在另一方面則金子交易地産交易種種投機事業極爲發達。現金多投用於此途。於是都市日苦膨脹農村日趨枯竭過去金融家之眼光僅及於上海一隅。視上海爲其生命財産之所託。維護不遺餘力。而於其他各地之凋敝。人民生計之艱苦。概漠不措意由是以觀。則金融家對於今日我國工商業之凋敝農村之破落殆尤不能不負相當之責任</p>
<p>尤有進者曩年在北京軍閥時代一切内戰無不有金融家爲之後盾設金融家而不供給軍閥以戰費則内戰斷無由而綿延不斷。此種内戰。則又所以予工商業以致命之打撃并使民生日趨於竊蹙者也其更善於射利者且利用其地位操縱公債之市價以剥削政府間接即所以剥削人民。而其結果則又恰爲增重人民之負擔使社會日益凋敝</p>
<p>故今日金融家而言發展民族之工商業則問題之重心殆不僅在於投資之徵信而實在於放開眼光以國家與民族之利益爲前提。苟有益於工商業者雖冒險亦有所當爲。如其無益則雖能博取若干之利息。亦有所不爲處於殘餘之封建勢力與國際資本帝國主義兩重壓迫桎梏之下脆弱之民族民商業。無日不處於風雨飄摇之險惡環境中更有何信可徵金融家亦惟有視其所應扶植者力予扶植而已脫必先察其資本之雄厚與否視其信用之穏固與否而後决定應予以扶植則今日我國内之工商業。有信足徵者。固亦極鮮矣</p>
<p>雖然近年以來我國百業概呈不振之現象獨銀行業頗呈好况。而銀行界人士之努力求進步亦爲不可掩飾之事實。中國上海浙江興業浙江實業諸銀行都設有調查科。於工商情况及市面情形都作詳細之調查。縝密之報告。最近且發起廢止内戰運動。欲博取國内之永久和平。實爲一種極可喜之現象。故吾人於此次徵信所之創設亦頗具良好之感想茲當該所創設之初敢以無限熱望之忱期祝其實踐其宣言與初衷</p>

<p>今余急欲言者在去年滿洲事變勃發時日美兩國即呈暗雲低迷之狀及至日軍將轟炸錦州美政府内部形勢更爲緊張胡佛總統召集緊急會議電令駐哈美總領事亨松急遽赴錦州國務卿史汀生亦以美政府名義提出禁止攻撃錦州之議案迨錦州被日占領日軍相繼入城美政府又變其從前所唱擁護自國權益與門户開放主義等高調更進而力說尊重九國條約凱洛格公約發出致中日通牒中直指日本行動爲違反條約謂「日本旣有此違反條約之行動正與美國以華盛頓海軍條約毁棄之權利凡世界各國應協力對日本加以道德的制裁迫令日本將已得之贓物完全歸還中國云云其漸與日本發生正面衝突已露其機矣不圖上海事變又起美國民中比較持守沉默態度者亦大警失色相率向日本開始猛烈攻撃一致主張排斥日本視日本爲野蠻人羣僑居上海之美國人復從中大爲鼓吹痛詆日軍之攻撃上海爲日本軍閥之一味侵略於是全美排日新聞之宣傳愈盛攻撃日本幾致體無完膚至三月十一日滿洲國成立排日之氣勞益如火上加油史汀生復得輿論之後援特致一公文書於上院外交委員長波拉氏策應其强硬意見他如前陸軍部長斐加·哥倫比亞大學校長巴德拉·哈佛大學校長羅愛爾等極力主張對日經濟封銷並提出激烈的膺懲日本論一時美國全士之與論風起雲湧排日氣燄不可嚮邇殆比一八九八年美國與西班牙戰爭時之狀况爲尤甚</p>
<p>但自史汀生宣言以後美政府態度忽又變爲沉寂之狀實令人不可思議今余推想彼之所以轉變爲沉寂態度者有二大苦衷在焉（一）輿論未統一（二）海軍力未充實是也吾人由日本之立塲預測日美兩國將來之關係實已迫近於戒心之途何則徵諸最近世界史所提供之事實現在日本地位恰與德國克辣靈司以後之狀况相同支配歷史運用之軌道在日德兩國之運命上當發生同樣之結果溯自一九一一年七月之克辣雪司直至一九一四年八月歐洲大戰勃發中間相隔不過三年由此而預卜將來日美兩國之衝突自一九三二年一月上海事件起計算醖釀至一九三五年恐發生種種不安之狀即在其時蓋一九三五年爲第二次倫敦會議之期也當第一次倫敦會議之决定案我日本已順從對美六成之比例但至第二次倫敦會議兩國必不免發生波瀾苟第二次倫敦會議决裂日美兩國之全權代表勢必拂袖而歸此時太平洋上必形成一新形勢引起重大的糾紛惟一九三五年前後之日本果處於如何之環境乎在太平洋彼岸之美國因第一次倫敦會議結果其强大的海軍或如勃拉德海軍提督所謂「現實之海軍足以威脅當時之日本」則此時美國必藉各種口實將滿洲問題舊事重提而與日爲難矣查美國蒙舍爾海相曾言目下英國約克生公司所經營之新嘉坡海軍根據地預定於一九三五年可以竣工倘此海軍大計畫一旦完成彼必扼守日本之南方航路馬拉加海峽的進口將制孤立極東一角之日本死命無疑且今日之英國與一九三五年之英國同加壓力於日本亦未可知不寗唯是一九三五年之蘇維埃第二次五年計畫亦將完成彼亦必崛起施其猛烈的壓迫此時日本勢將陷於危急困難之環以决國家存亡之命運矣</p>
<p>余默察滿洲事變後美國之動靜得以下述之愚見判斷之、吾人統觀日美兩國已往之歷史、對抗之形勢、已亘三十年、其間如排斥移民問題·二十一條干涉問題·山東問題·西伯利亞出兵問題·與其他接踵而起之各種難問題、兩國間如火如茶、常覺難以兩立、破裂之危機、早有一觸即發之勢、而其能遷延迄今、尙末决裂者、良以日本始終忍耐自制有以致之也、今則已知自制力之歸於徒勞、不能克服支配人類世界自然之威力矣</p>
<p>吾人推究有史以來之世界大戰原因發見挑撥戰爭之責任者、除野心家威爾希德羅特外、尙有他人在焉、此人爲誰、即架於絞首台上惡駡威廉第二挑撥戰爭之元兇是也、因此元兇之作祟、竟在瞬間、突然發生慘酷之悲劇故余就歐羅巴之情勢而推想到今日日美之軋轢、雖如何提倡力保和平之精神、然其結果、恐非人力所能挽回耳、脅迫二十世紀歐羅巴之英德對抗、德法反目、俄奥傾軋等、已在非人力所能挽救之勢、今日者美兩國之抗爭、前後已亘三十年、殆已至二十世紀時歐洲同漾之局面矣、苟日美兩國發生戰爭、不獨當事國間蒙無窮之災厄、全世界各國、亦必將捲入漩渦、同遭悲慘之大禍、吾人若不體念此事實、兩國民之自制力、一亘失常、則戰爭之爆發、可立而待也現在美國之態度、吾人頗引爲遺憾、</p>
<p>蓋彼之脅威他國、容　他國之生存問題、不克强制其自國之意思、激成戰爭之慘禍、固在吾人意料之中、總之過去三十年間日美對抗之勢、醖釀已到成熟時期、戰爭之勃發、實已無可避免、此我日本帝國與日本國民之所當周知者也（完）</p>

<p>實部訓詞　實業代表國際貿易局副局長何炳賢訓詞云、主席諸位、今日是上海市國貨展覽會開幕的日子、兄弟奉實業部派來代表參加、實在覺得非常榮幸方才聽王席報告、本會籌備的經過的兄弟對於諸位過去的努力、十分表示欽佩、舉行國貨展覺會是一件很有意義的事、尤其是在這國難當前、東北沉淪、滬北毁滅當中舉行、更含有深遠的意義、自去年九月十八日、日本開始佔領東三省後我們日日在報紙中、看見飛機炸彈大砲坦克車等等戰爭利器的名詞、和我們東北同胞國破家亡的慘狀、到了今年一月二十八日、日本又在上海重演夜襲瀋陽的故智、於是我們從前只在報紙上看見的名詞、現在親眼看見和親耳聽得了、從前只在報紙中得見同胞被難的慘狀、現在我們都直接或間接的身受了、這種深刻的印象、是不容易磨滅的、但是我們要知道戰爭有兩種、一種是軍事戰爭、就是我們自一二八以來所身受的、還有一種是商業戰爭、就是我們自被帝國主義壓迫以來時時刻刻所身受的不過商業戰爭所用利器不是飛機大砲和坦克車、所以我們也看不見流血和火燄的凶象、因此很多人、雖然自有生以來、日日身受着、還不覺得、其實這種敵精吸髓殺人不見血的商業戰爭、是百倍千倍慘過軍事戰爭、軍事戰爭的失敗、是政治上的亡國我們還可以徐圖恢復、商業戰爭失敗、就是經濟上的亡國、這就是萬刦不復的、所以我們對於軍事戰爭要抵抗、商業上戰爭更要抵抗、軍事戰爭的利器是槍砲所以我們就用槍砲抵抗她商業戰爭的利器是貨品、我們就要用貨品抵抗她說到此處、我實覺得非常痛心、我國自與外國通商以來、年年都是入口超過出口、并且這種比例、一年大過一年、民元入超數是二萬一千三百零一萬餘兩、到了民二十、就到了五萬五千九百八十五萬餘兩、增加的多過了兩倍半、僅就民元至民二十而說這二十年中我國入超的數額、已達到了三十九兆一千二百二十三萬餘兩、這實在是一個驚人的數目我們若用這欵項用在國内、那麽軍事上·實業上·交通上·内政上·敎育上·社會上·都有大大的改革我國現在也不至弄到這樣的貧弱的地步了、但是遣筆欵子、是流到外國去了、所以弄到我國的農村破産·工業凋零·商業更奄奄一息完全在帝國主義的鼻息下生活着、到了現在、我國的國民經濟、已經到破産地步了、我們快要經濟亡國了、我們難道坐以待斃麽我們不要起來設法抵抗麽、前次我們第十九路軍、在淞滬抵抗日本侵掠我的時候、全國民衆、尤其是上海民衆、都起來援助、可見全國國民、都是主張抵抗的、這當然不是單對於軍事上侵掠如此、對於經濟上侵掠也是如此、因爲國破家亡、是大家所不願意身受的、我們旣然確定了對於外國經濟侵掠、應該抵抗、現在說什麽抵抗、我國知道、外國侵掠中國、所用仍是貨物、我們就用貨物去抵抗牠、換句話說、就是振興國貨、去替代外貨、我佷不相信那種純粹唯心派的理論、以爲中國人無論在那種情境之下、都祗應該用中國貨、不錯、這自然是十二萬分應該的、但應該是一件事、事實又是一件事、人類的天性、誰不愛美衛便當廉價的東西、這種人欲知天理戰爭的時候、天理實在不能維持長久、我們曾經抵制過英國貨·抵制過美國貨·日本貨·更抵制過不少次數、但是都不能持久、就以這次創巨痛深的經騐來抵制日貨、現在報紙上已經日日有大批日貨進口的消息登載了、華北方而、且彰明顯著的賣買日本貨了、有人都責中國人祗有五分鐘熱庶、其憲這是人類天性、任何種民族、處這種情境之、也不免有這種現象、我們若認清楚了這點、然後可以根本謀補救、不然、紙上談兵、結果還是踏從前失敗的覆轍、根本原因、是什麽、就是改良國貨、我們要將外貨的優點、都具在國貨中、并且設法增加生産以期普及、上面我已經說到人們普通的心理、一方面對於外來經濟侵掠是抱一種抗的態度、一方面又很難長期克復外貨的引誘、這種心理、表面着來、雖然互相矛盾、但人們的内心、實在就是這樣、我們只有利用這種心理、然後才能够成功、我上而說過、振興國貨、才能抵抗外國的經濟侵掠、但單在振興上着想、還是不能够達到目的、因爲一種貨物、若要普及、必先要大家都知道、外國貨物、注意宜傳、我國報紙雜誌中的廣告、差不多一大半是洋行的、即如國際貿易局所出的工商半月刋、一個月以前、裏面的廣告、十分之九、都是外商的、此外南京路和各公司、和其餘大商店、差不多變成了外貨的陳列場、我們政府、表面固然也設了幾處國貨陳列館、但就數目上設備上比較起來、眞有天淵之别了、因此我們就要謀補救、國貨展覽會就是補救的一辦法、會塲内陳設各種國貨、一方面對於國貨宣傳、引起國人對於國貨的認識和興趣、一方面又可引起國内資本家、對於振興國内實業的决心、就心理上說起來、就是一方面增加國人對於外國經濟侵掠的决心、一方面又給予人以國貨的優點的印象、使他自然不願買外貨、這種意義是很重大、决不是那種消極的宣傳所能做到的、所以我們可以說、國貨展覽會、就是經濟戰爭利器的陳列所、我們旣然對於外國經濟侵掠、抱有抵抗的决心、今日到了這個軍器陳列所、希望大家仔細研究一下、看看我們的軍器和外國比較起來究竟到了什麽程度、語云、知己知彼、百戰百勝、願我們大家都向這點努力、今日我就這點意義、寫出來、祝此次上海市國貨展覽會以成功、</p>

<p>晚上我們就在吳公館裏過夜。春生哥和我住在一房。春生哥說：『我們吹了燈再睡吧。···呼，呼···奇怪！這燈兒怎麽吹不烏呀？鐘兒！你起來看看。』我也吹了幾吹，火光一動也不動。仔細看看，正是：城裏燈，</p>
<p>一點汕也無。</p>
<p>洋火點不着，</p>
<p>大嘴吹不烏。</p>
<p>這燈兒是妙極了。我的確不懂從那兒來的火光。那根線大概是很有關係。你看，那是一极雙股線。這伶股線裏必定是有奇妙的把戲。『吳大少丨你府上這個燈兒怎麽吹不烏？』吳大少在客廳上哈哈大笑說：『鄉下老，這是電燈，怎麽吹得烏呢？你要牠烏也不難。你看，：得搭···不是烏了嗎？而亮······有趣！』春生哥也來試了幾試。我們愈試得有趣便愈覺得莫明其妙。吳大少的一知半解的說明不能滿足我的求知慾。我睡在床上足足想了一個鐘頭都想不出出什麽道理來。最後我是下了一個决心，明天是要請的先生，别的資格我可以將就，若是他說不出電燈是如何發光，我是不願意請的。對，我千萬不要忘記問他那些鏡子裏的人影什麽現出這麽多的奇形怪狀。這個道理他若是說不出來也不配做我們古廟的先生。因爲他若回答不出這些問題，於我有什麽益處，於我們對莊裏的孩子有什麽益處？哈哈·先生没有考我們，我們倒先要考起先生來，豈有此理！除此以外我還有什麽别的辦法呢？</p>

<p>充厚實力　盛大熱烈之歡呼聲、與悠揚悅耳之音樂聲、將於七月三十一日星期日、在洛衫磯傳播第十屆世界運動會之開幕禮矣、此世界屬目之各國著名運動員之大集合中、有芬蘭中長距離賽跑家帕伏納米氏、第九屆世界大會百米冠軍潘賽威廉士、美國短跑明星威可夫、及其他實力相等之各國競技英雄、如美國千五百米大將望士克、短跑界之土倫、中距離之依斯脫孟、及芬蘭德國瑞典諸名手、而日本在上屆大會中、曾列田徑賽線分之前第五名、本屆必增厚實力、冀獲最佳之成績、並擬選派女子田徑賽選手多人、前往參加、</p>

<p>— 梅花</p>
<p>最先來要求吾敎拉丁的是梁任公。任公求敎的時候，他已經學過五個月的拉丁。後來纔有蔡孑民·張菊生·汪康年諸位。吾感於這幾位向學的熱誠，就聯想到一般靑年，就决定辦震旦。</p>
<p>震旦創辦時期學風的敦厚，是不可多得的。那時同學非但都有自治自動的能力，而且讀書勇氣百倍，實在可敬可佩！有時吾看見他們太用功，就叮囑他們應該休息，休息。所以，那時，學生要讀書，吾反而禁止他們讀書。那時晚上還用油燈，吾在晚上去訪問同學，個個都在燈下讀書，到了熄火的時候，吾自己親自去熄火，待吾走後，他們又背着吾點火讀書，弄得吾實在没法對付。因爲那時他們讀書有這樣勇氣，所以奇得很，初學不滿五六個月，就可以進而讀拉丁的文選。吾曾經拿這事和外國人談，外國人都不信，認爲這是不可能的事。後來，胡敦復出洋到美國去留學，那時據美國學制，進大學要懂拉丁，胡敦復說：「吾在中國讀過」。他們不信，拿出拉丁文選來，當塲試騐，恰巧翻出的幾頁都是胡敦復在震旦讀過的，試騐結果，不但能讀，而且能講，於是他們纔歎服。</p>
<h3 id="c188">讀了「白屋書信」以後 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 翰</p>
<p>吾的朋友徐蔚南告訴吾，他的朋友劉大白死了，「在國難當頭，人心惶惶的時候死了！」</p>
<p>大白曾經在蔣夢麐長敎時期當過一任敎育次長。他如果是一位臭官僚，他實在死無足惜。然而大白是詩人，是學者，是敎育家，又是呈生平認識的熟人中印象較深的一人。</p>
<p>六年前吾在復旦大學充事務主任的時候，大白與吾同住在南宿舍，吾住在極南的一間，他住在北面一間，他担任敎務，吾担任事務，自然兩人佷少談話的機會，然而吾對於他的印象是很深的。聽說大白身後蕭條，連棺材裏的被頭蓋着了頭就蓋不着脚，他死前曾說起要和幾位朋友談談後事，終於歎了一口氣說：「吾的朋友都是拿筆桿的窮朋友，後事也無庸談了！」</p>
<p>蔚南是大白的知己，自從大白死後，著名滑稽的蔚南也變成喪家之×（唐突）。他爲了紀念大白並想扶助大白子女的敎育，特地拿大白給他的信理出來，共有八十封，編成白屋書信「從這八十封信裏，大白的性情，學問，生活，希望和他的病情，我們至少都可以窺見一角。」</p>
<p>吾多少是認識大白的，所以白屋書信拿到手，就一口氣讀完吾覺得這本小書確有介紹的價值，尤其是靑年朋友，都應該讀這本書。</p>
<p>白屋書信裏的精采甚多，且摘錄幾段獻給讀者：</p>
<h3 id="c189">漢宫春 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 老蘭</p>
<p>吾家海山仙館。在半塘荔支　。爲南漢昌華苑故址。從伯祖德輿方伯公别業。水榭風廊。迤邐十數里。中有碧璜。乃仿西湖三潭印月。闢七塘而成。余足跡遍吳越。曾瞻内苑昆明湖。所稱名園。未之能及。今人事滄桑。時移景易。維舟憑眺。只餘百頃芳塘。荷花送晚耳。夏鳴之田石友所繪圖。猶在友人家。時假披覽。尙可指其一二勝概。辛未消夏。偶懷故鄉。爲拈此調。</p>
<p>零落神山。認昌華故苑。丹荔灣頭。荒塘綠荷漲晚。蕩夏成新。三潭月印。比西湖。潮定風柔。都換了。斷橋廢館。盡圖收拾芳洲。回眄海桑成幻。便齊雲結綺。曾幾來游。烏衣舊時堂榭。讓與間鷗。金題錦瞫。有黹叢</p>
<p>書人去名留。吾老矣。靑　辦否。歸時重理漁舟。</p>
<p>「我生平最受影響的有三種東西，就是八股，數學和佛經，數學使吾養成比較邏輯的頭腦，佛經養成我底犧牲性，勇往性。至於八股，本來應該給與我以壞影響的·····我却從它那裏得到頭腦比較細密的鍜鍊。我還有從佛經得到的是宗敎的汎愛。」從這片段中可以窺見大白人生觀的基點。</p>
<p>大白不欲做官而偏做官，所以時常向蔚南發牢騷，官做得愈紅，他的牢騷發得也愈厲害：</p>
<p>「等情據此的生涯，差不多幹了十個月。無絲竹之悅耳，有案牘之勞形，你想這是多麽乾燥，但是吾這還不怕；最怕的是飯碗黨的包圍。」</p>
<p>「現在你應該向我祝賀了。老劉底官運不是高於輕汽球而是薄於輕汽球，這輕汽球已經爆裂了！」</p>
<p>大白規勸蔚南的話，句句金玉、可以做靑年立身處世的南針，且錄白屋書信中一段：</p>
<p>「常常有人說，眼光要放得遠；不錯眼光不遠是不得的。但是眼光放得太遠了，眼前的實際問題反而不看見了。</p>
<p>「凡人做事，一定要從處理最小最小的因難的實際問題中磨鍊出來。」</p>
<p>白屋書信裏的精采警語實在太多，還是請讀者去購原書來一讀吧。（按此書由上海及各地世界書局代售，定價三角。）（酬金贈劉氏遺族）</p>

<p>其影響及於社會經濟者。一切器用。捨中取西。我國舊有之工藝。逐漸歸於淘汰。而失業貧苦之人多矣。去歲進口貨值洋二十二萬萬元之鉅額。出入不敷者達八萬萬元。此爲近年提倡歐風發展欲望之效騐。甚顯明矣。譬如病人。更加創傷。流血不止。欲其久活。安可得哉。今人動曰。此帝國主義者資本侵略之咎也。固矣。然日本非居於同等地位。同受歐美各國之資本侵略者乎。何爲而彼能自固自强。爲列雄所憚如此也。夫起居日用服裝之不便。莫甚於日本。假令日本亦競尙奢侈。好便利。求適體。則必棄其所固有者。而求　外　。其所耗價欵之鉅。不堪設想。如西式浴缸·便具·火罏·衣櫃·銅鐵牀·揮簧褥桌椅·地毯等等。皆我國新人物認爲不可少者。彼國則除極少數蹟族豪商及公共建築外。普通中卜等人家概無此等物也。尋常家屋。並玻璃牕而無之。夫彼多數人民。能毅然守其舊有之俗尙。而安於不便不適者。蓋由能抑制私人之欲望。以保全立國之精神與物力而已。此非敎育之力不爲功。而彼敎育家能於數十年前具此隻眼者。則由當時維新諸傑。深得力於中國之學術。（多數爲陽明學者）能見其遠且大者。知保存國粹。即所以强固國力。故不爲西來文化所侵略也。蓋禮敎與儉約者。中國文化之美粹也。禮以克己制欲爲主。寡欲則倫而約矣。此今人所病爲消極道德吃人禮敎者。故反其道而行之。曰。發展欲望。乃能促進文化。嗚呼。事實證騐。則何如乎。自古以來。凡能福其民而利其國者。考諸史册。皆富於此消極道德者也。</p>

<p>日軍轟撃淞滬，任情屠殺，閘北，江灣，，太倉，常熟。各地無辜民衆，遭此浩刦，商店工塲，市廛廬舍，焚燬殆盡！哀鴻遍野，流離失所，無家可歸者，總數在十萬人以上。誰爲爲之？孰令致之？誠令人悲感萬狀也！</p>
<p>民生改進社同志黄警項，潘仰堯，應書貴，李登輝，等十餘人，另組小組委員會，研討難民生路問題，由黄君主持，籌設「一二八難民工廠，」經費暫由中華基督敎會及幾個國體與私人撥助，廠址在北新涇羅别根路，晚昨日曾往參觀，茲摭氓如下：</p>
<p>該廠創辦伊始，容收難民九十餘人，現陸正續進來，皆有工作，老弱者任看門扶育小孩搓繩等職，年壯者皆學習一種技能，各有師父傳授，有達學齡兒童，令其讀書，難工晚間餘暇，亦有補習夜校，均由柏志安女士主持。難民居住，一任自然，母女，夫妻，父子，兄弟，本有家庭組織者，仍可合住，惟鰥夫獨女，則予以離别。該廠暫分（甲）襪工（乙）藤工（丙）木工（丁）。裁縫（戊）草工此外尙擬增設「織布」「皮革」「玻璃」各部，據黄君言：「難民衷練不易，常發生爭噪情節，貪吃懶做，不肯工作，須誠意開導。」</p>
<p>難民人廠後，依其個性志趣，由師父則訓練一種工藝，實行爲做工而吃飯主義。該廠將來擬改名「合作工廠，」目的在救濟苦難同胞，非若資本家投資開設者可比，勞動者剩餘，仍由勞動者消費，該廠將來發展，爲建設北新涇區之中心，黄君極願深人民間，從事鄉村改造運動云。</p>

<p>第九回　附專車逐客有虚驚　坐冷衙化石成遐想　　毛德順悄悄在安玉田身後推了他一把。安玉田也旋即會意互此處座位不能容他久久的僭據。就起身告辭。騰出那近水樓臺的好位置。讓那些夠身分的闊人去奉陪大帥。然而他已是非常的滿意了。退到五太太的包廂裏。被梁笑雲問起。約略報告了一些美滿的經過。又另謝過五太太一番周到的關照。梁笑雲固是喜之不盡。他也還兀坐著重把剛才所得的種種印象。細加一番整理與回味的工夫。這其中最使他感覺奇異的。是葉作章絶不似他意想中那般的粗魯。也不像平日輿論上所攻撃的那樣的惡劣。粗人决不能說出那許多有道理的話。惡人尤其是不會那樣虚心用賢。可見一介武夫能做到督軍那般高大的地位絶非完全僥倖得來。總多少也自有他的長處。事非經過不知。聞名不如見面。平日逞書生之見。將這般軍閥一概抹煞。實是一種錯誤。不過錯誤越來越多。他已是入了軍閥的魔。中了軍閥的毒。眞就要去甘心降順。無可救藥了。如是亂想著竟把這一臺好戲。在視而不見聽而不聞中糢糊過去。兩夫婦旋又親送五太太回府。被五太太仍邀進去叙談一會。所談的是請他們伉儷都搭專車出京。臨行可先到這裏來一同上車。諸事伊好派人照料。梁笑雲想。夫壻初次出去幹事。總須伊這個賢内助一手輔佐。自己若常與五太太在一起。還可抓牢這根得力的内綫。當即欣然答應。及離了葉宅回家以後。兩夫婦又計議著把北京宅子裏事情結束一番許多笨重的箱攏木器。因爲此次出門是附乘别人的專車。不便多於携帶。又事情究還未十分定局也不能冐冐失失的就把家全搬了去。便祇好暫留在北京不動。箱攏上鎖加封。所有木器雜物仍分别鎖閉在各屋子裏。留房門裏的常勝和娘姨阿金看守。兩夫婦祇帶些隨身替換衣物。裝成兩三件輕便小皮鞄。帶名小當差王定一個小大姐阿巧同行。又把梁笑雲一筆存欵。向銀行提出開成匯票。專作此次出外的花銷。</p>

<p>橡膠概况，本附刋已有相當介紹，然工廠實地工作情形，及製法種類，與夫我國對本事業之發展概况，或亦讀者諸君所樂聞歟，謹將服務所得，略述如，后</p>
<p>橡膠旣以加硫Vulcanizing法，而見重於世，故其製法，亦不外加入硫横而使起作用，然工作方法，亦有種種，其已行用於工廠中者，實可簡分四類，</p>
<p>（一）熱加硫法　此種方法，所製出品甚多，不勝枚舉，其工作步驟，係將橡皮與配合物，並加入昇華硫磺，在混合機中充分混合，軋成板狀，形成物品，送入加熱器中養化之，惟此種加熱器及方法，亦有多種，如「直接熱加硫」其製品代表如鞋跟，橡膠磚等，惟此法太舊，現旣少用，「直接蒸氣加硫」混合橡膠製品除須加熱外，亦須加以壓力，本法因有蒸氣壓力，故對於製品甚爲有利，慛有表面色彩關係者，尙不適用，「問接蒸氣加硫」此種裝置形式頗多不同，然其原理則係通蒸氣於蛇管中，在秘室或器中加熱，惟祇有熱度，而無壓力，缺點頗多，然工程者，能用相當藥料，仍能補救，是在工程者能否運用而已，「間接蒸氣壓力加硫」此法係用空氣磅浦機，增加空氣壓力，或用壓縮器中Press者，現近工廠用者甚多，此外又有用電熱以代蒸氣熱者，然以費用較大，用者尙鮮，我國目前各廠所用者，類皆熱加硫法也，</p>
<p>（二）冷加硫法　此法係利用綠氣與硫磺化合物，能在常温度中，完成加硫與養化作用，我國工廠，用此法以製品物者，尙未有聞，製品以簿片者爲宜，如醫學用具，兒童玩具，橡膠手套等，皆可用此法加硫，尚有冷熱二法並用者，可製雨衣布等品，</p>
<p>（三）空氣加硫法　此法亦有兩種，其一爲熱加硫之變相，其一即冷加硫之變相，前者係溶融硫磺於器内，非如熱加硫法用硫磺混合於製品，美國稱此法爲硫礦浴法，蓋製品如在硫磺空氣中沐浴，後者係錄硫化合氣體，送入已放置製品之密秘室内，以完成加硫工作，製品如手套，熱水袋，浗水帽，救生圈，等甚多，性質較冷加硫法所製成者爲佳，因冷加硫品，對於韌性拉力均稍弱也，</p>
<p>（四）高壓力重熱加硫法　此法係將橡膠化爲固體，須加入硫碘量二五丨三％用高壓力與熱度，長時間養化之，而配合方法，亦甚重要，通常係用高等油蠟以助其緻密光滑，其成品俗稱電木，有絶緣性，用於電氣材料裝飾品，留聲片，自來水筆桿等，惟製法不良者，則有遇熱軟化之弊</p>
<p>我國有橡膠化工業之歷史，不及百年，所製品物，多用熱加硫法，其出品亦以鞋類爲最著，其他尙待振興，故程度實勘幼稚，蓋國内不靜，資産界對於實業，輒少興趣，而技術人員，又甚缺少，每有聘用外人技師之舉，致技術不能因研究而進步，而工程權操諸於人，國産原料即不能利用，原料中如養化鋅，養化鉛，炭酸鈣，炭酸鎂，白堊，及一切特效膠油劑，橡皮代用品等，國内均有多量天然原料，不難加以化製，惜國人不加研究，或少運絡，而資本家又迷信外人，利權外溢，至可慨也，</p>

<h3 id="c222">開會 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 魯單</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在佈告處貼著大小不同，顔色不同，字體不同的種種佈告，上面寫著一例（或者是相近）的條告，</p>
<p>本會定於×日×午×時假第×敎室舉行第×次常會，屆時務希全體會員出席爲荷，某某會×日</p>
<p>每日至少有三五個集會，其中有同鄉會，有同學會，也有什麽社，什麽團，反正有了人便有了名義，大學生有的是洋錢和工夫，又怎麽不「活動」呢，</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>和幾個小姐坐在樹蔭裏，害得拉人開會的先生，忙了一頭的汗球，我目睹他做作的莊嚴重壓不下緊張的心情，向那位被人稱爲活動份子的Ａ女士說道，</p>
<p>「Ａ女士請你就到×敎室開會，」好似快慰，好似怨恨，Ａ女士在起身的時候自言自語，</p>
<p>「每天爲著開會呌人實在疲倦，」誠然Ａ女士實在多勞，任何一個會中的職員表，總有伊的名呢，</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>Ｗ社舉行幹事會，男幹事俱已到齊，只有Ｃ女士遲遲未到，主席再三懇請，大衆一致候駕，但是當主席第四次往請回來報告，</p>
<p>「Ｏ女士頭髮没　完，恐怕不能來開會···」</p>
<p>「女子爲什爲麽竟自動的放棄應有的權利？」這是感嘆家的聲音，</p>
<p>這一次的會議，似乎在没精打彩中渡過，</p>
<p>性的問題</p>
<h3 id="c223">求愛的條件 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 阿牛</p>
<p>我常常公園裹，馬路上，看見一對一對的紅男綠女，手挽手的慢步着，喁喁講不完情話。但細細考察他們的結果，我雖没有精密的統計，但凶終隙末，大閙一幕請律師上法庭的趣劇，决定不在少數，原因爲何，因爲没有備具以下六種條件的綠故。</p>
<p>第一個條件，你如果想求一個漂亮的愛人，那末你自己省省，你有多少家産？或是每月有多少進欵？夠不夠你那位愛人買長統絲襪，高跟皮鞋，旗袍，舞衣，法國化裝品，以及一切一切的零用。</p>
<p>第二個條件，就是你有没有洋房，汽車？當然！一個艶若桃李麗如美玉的愛人，那裏可以攢到一個矮平房中，並且輕移玉趾，在馬路上跑呢？所以你還得備置一座精緻的洋房，可以金屋藏嬌。一輛新式汽車，可以兜兜風，或是開到跳舞塲。</p>
<p>第三個條件，你自己或是你父親，哥哥在社會上的地位怎麽樣？是不是個享有盛譽的博士·碩士·專家·或是再大一點的國府裏的主席院長部長·或是一市裏的市長，一縣裏的縣長，或是拿槍桿兒的總司令軍長師長旅長團長。</p>
<p>第四個條件，尊容如何？先得拿面鏡子來照一照，可以看得過去，當然不成問題。如果生得很醜或是一面孔的麻點，那末黄狼休想吃天鵝肉了，</p>
<p>第五個條件，學問的程度如何？如果你是個中學生，那末你休想找個愛人是大學生，只好找個小學畢業生。如果你是大學生，才可配個中學生。你若是留學歸來的博士碩士，那末你儘管去揀個大學生。要是你自己只是個小學畢業生，那未你只好揀個不識字的不學生了</p>
<p>第六個條件，你有没有奴隸性，肯不肯供你的愛人差使？以上的六個條件如果你都不具備，那末盡你的力量去追求，愛神之箭，决不會光顧到你的頭上來的。就是光臨，也不會永久飽受你的艶福。</p>
<p>可是這班密絲們怎樣呢？我說請她們放心呢！祇須你把胭脂花粉塗上了幾層厚，總有人來追求的。</p>

<h3 id="c224">拆字先生 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 鷖</p>
<p>記得我在崑山××中心小學混飯吃的時候，一天下午散課後，十幾個住校同事正聚在操場的一角嘻嘻哈哈的談笑，一陣噹叮噹叮的鈴聲送進我們的耳朶來，走出校門一瞧，原來是個拆字先生，自遠而近，最令引人發笑的漫，把他喊了進來，那是個三十開外的中年人，焦黄臉，黑漆牙，顯是個鴉片鬼，一件白竹布長衫，已髒得像抹桌布，拖雙破黑布鞋，手裏提了只大英牌香煙匣，匣子裏自然是他騙飯吃的傢伙，他坐定後，打開他的寳箱，</p>
<p>「啥字體？」</p>
<p>「我落掉一支自來水筆，勿曉得尋得着麽」漫擺着莊嚴的神色，鄭重的告訴他，同事們都以爲是件正經事瞧着，　　「哦。落掉幾天啦？」</p>
<p>「一個多禮拜啦丁」</p>
<p>「你拿一個紙捲出來吧」！好隨手拿了個出來，翻開看是個「木」字，於是他大發其理論，斷定是找不到的啦，漫突然大笑起來，從衣袋裏拿出好底派克來說，「我并没落掉吓······」拆字先生的臉，頓時漲紅起來，我們也摸着了頭腦，拍手踏脚的大笑，拆字先生在走得無路中站起身向我們打了作揖，開始述他的經歷，「不瞞諸位先生說，我是個師範畢業生，曾做過幾年小學敎員，自己勿好，吃上了鴉片，家産用完，敎員又做勿成，實在没有辦法，只得出此下策，還望諸位先生原諒我的苦衷呢，······」他說時，帶着無限的創痛，我們也給他說得呆了多時，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Thoughts on the Establishment of the China Credit Bureau <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Bin</p>
<p>Recently, the banking sector, in order to connect industry and commerce with the banking industry and to support the development of national industry and commerce, specially established the China Credit Bureau. This type of enterprise is still in its infancy in our country, and public opinion has high expectations for it, believing that it is deeply related to the future of our country's industry and commerce. We also share this sentiment.</p>
<p>The China Credit Bureau's declaration states: "In recent years, industry and commerce have been unable to develop due to weak capital and lack of assistance, while frequent disasters in the interior and rampant banditry have led to the decline of rural areas, with cash concentrated in urban areas."</p>
<p>This truly speaks to the desolate situation in our country and the abnormal state of the financial industry. Industry and commerce are struggling due to weak capital, while the financial industry is suffering from inflation because it has huge amounts of capital but no way to absorb it. This kind of extremely contradictory phenomenon can be used to explain the past financial community's failure to provide even the slightest support to national industry and commerce. Examining the business report of the Bank of China for the 20th year, the total assets amounted to more than 84,621,000 yuan, while loans to industry amounted to more than 33,367,400 yuan. Furthermore, the business report of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank for the 20th year showed total assets of more than 11,611,000 yuan, with loans to domestic industry amounting to more than 23 million yuan. Using these two banks as examples, one can infer the situation of the others. However, in recent years, the silk industry in our country has fallen into a desperate situation. If financiers had far-sighted vision and considered the future of national industry and commerce, they would have provided strong support, as it was their duty to do so. But in reality, last year, the 29,000 silk looms of various silk factories in Shanghai, with about 10,000 dan of silkworm cocoons in storage, were all mortgaged to financial institutions, yet they were still unable to save the silk industry from collapse. From this, it can be seen that financiers not only lacked long-term plans for industry and commerce and failed to use their inflated cash to develop industry and commerce, but on the contrary, they used extremely high interest rates on debts to swallow up dying industry and commerce. This is true for industry and commerce, and it is also true for agriculture. It is an extremely common phenomenon for farmers to mortgage their farmland or seedlings, as well as various agricultural products, to receive loans from banks, pawnshops, and bank agents at extremely high interest rates. This phenomenon is precisely what absorbs the blood and sweat of farmers and transports it to the cities, causing rural areas to collapse and decline even further. However, on the other hand, gold transactions, real estate transactions, and various speculative businesses are extremely developed. Cash is mostly invested in these avenues. As a result, cities suffer from inflation daily, and rural areas become increasingly depleted. In the past, financiers' vision only extended to Shanghai, regarding Shanghai as the place where their lives and property were entrusted, and spared no effort in protecting it. But they were generally indifferent to the desolation of other places and the hardship of the people's livelihoods. From this perspective, financiers are largely responsible for the desolation of our country's industry and commerce and the collapse of rural areas today.</p>
<p>What's more, in the past, during the warlord era in Beijing, all internal wars had financiers as their backers. If financiers had not supplied the warlords with war funds, the internal wars would not have continued endlessly. These internal wars were precisely what dealt a fatal blow to industry and commerce and made people's lives increasingly difficult. Those who were even better at seeking profit also used their positions to manipulate the market prices of public bonds in order to exploit the government, indirectly exploiting the people. The result was to increase the people's burden and make society increasingly desolate.</p>
<p>Therefore, for today's financiers, the key to developing national industry and commerce is not just about credit investigation for investment, but about broadening their horizons and prioritizing the interests of the country and the nation. If it benefits industry and commerce, it is worth taking risks. If it does not benefit, even if it can earn some interest, it is not worth doing. Under the double oppression of residual feudal forces and international capitalist imperialism, the fragile national industry and commerce are constantly in a perilous environment. What creditworthiness is there to investigate? Financiers can only strongly support those they should support. If they must first examine the strength of their capital and assess the stability of their credit before deciding whether to provide support, then today, there are very few industries and businesses in our country that are creditworthy enough.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, while most industries in our country have shown a declining trend, the banking industry has shown a good trend. The efforts of people in the banking sector to seek progress are also undeniable facts. The Bank of China, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, and Zhejiang Industrial Bank all have investigation departments that conduct detailed investigations and meticulous reports on industrial and commercial conditions and market conditions. Recently, they even initiated a movement to abolish internal wars in an attempt to achieve lasting peace within the country, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. Therefore, we also have good feelings about the establishment of this credit bureau. As it is being established, we dare to express our sincere hope that it will fulfill its declaration and initial intentions.</p>

<p>Japanese Reports of Ma's Unit's Defeat Are Not Accurate</p>
<p>Fighting in Northern Manchuria Will Continue for a Long Time</p>
<p>Japanese Lost Two Aircraft Several Days Ago</p>
<p>(Harbin) Recent reports from the Japanese side about General Ma Zhanshan's defeat are not accurate. According to the most reliable sources, the fighting in northern Manchuria will continue for a long time. The Japanese military's reports of the casualties of the Chinese army are generally exaggerated. The recent Japanese reports of the defeat of Ma Zhanshan's army are also mostly false. The forces they have been fighting with are actually the armies of other leaders such as Ding Chao and Li Du. Ma Zhanshan's main force is still gathered near Heilongjiang, with complete military uniforms and sufficient weapons and ammunition, and there is no sign of retreat. Several days ago, the Japanese army lost two aircraft. The Japanese side is covering this up. One aircraft was hit in the engine by Chinese troops near Hulan. The pilot still managed to fly back to Harbin. Before reaching the airfield, it crashed into the roof of a suburban house. The nose of the plane went through the roof, and both wings were destroyed. The Japanese at the nearby airfield rushed to drag the pilot out of the plane. He was covered in blood, but his mind was still clear. They carried him into a car and sent him to the hospital. Another officer in the plane was only slightly injured. Another aircraft landed near Hailun due to mechanical failure. There were no Chinese troops in that area. The Japanese removed the main components of the aircraft and loaded them onto a truck and took them away. (National News Agency telegram, 5th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Jilin Self-Defense Army has attacked the enemy from Panshi County and has reached Yantong Mountain West. The two sides are two li apart. Our unit advanced along the Songhua River to the Taipinggou and Shijiagou areas of Emu County. The enemy has a tendency to retreat without fighting. (Special telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>(Harbin) Li Haiqing's army retreated north along the railway from Anda and gathered at Huoshanzi. There is a trend to turn towards Hailun via Wangkui and join with the Li Tiande and Shen Hongyou brigades. Japanese aircraft bombed those who did not retreat. Shen Hongyou's 700 cavalrymen will leave Lanxi Shijianfang and head to Lanxi East Fifth Station to support Li's army in surrounding Li Haiqing's army in Hongjiadian. They retreated on the evening of the 3rd. (Special telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Items on the Train Looted Clean</p>
<p>Eleven Passengers Kidnapped</p>
<p>Banditry near Harbin is intensifying. Yesterday, a group of bandits intercepted a train on the Chinese Eastern Railway line 35 miles east of Harbin. All 176 passengers were forced off the train, and their luggage was searched. Anything of value was taken away. Finally, 96 passengers were kidnapped for ransom. Today, it was heard that several kidnapped Russians had escaped, but many who were detained in the bandit's lair are still there. (Reuters telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 5:15 PM on the 3rd, a special passenger train heading from Harbin to the Suifenhe section of Yimianpo Station was surrounded and robbed by 50 bandits near Ercesndiangzi. All 160 passengers were looted clean. 90 passengers dressed neatly were tied up and taken into the mountains, searched a second time, and then 11 who looked wealthy were selected and kidnapped into the valley. The rest were released. While the bandits were robbing, they fired their guns to intimidate them while searching the passengers on the train. Fortunately, no train crew members were killed or injured. The train turned back halfway before reaching Yimianpo. On the morning of the 4th, it arrived at the Harbin Railway Bureau. Due to the danger on the eastern line, the railway bureau ordered on the 4th that the 4th train to Suifenhe on the 3rd would stop at Yimianpo, and the special train would be shortened to Ashihe Station.

<p>Investigative Commission</p>
<p>Organizing Materials in Beiping</p>
<h3 id="e11">Commissioners Held a Meeting Yesterday Morning <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Investigative Commission felt that it was inconvenient to organize materials at the Beijing Hotel, where they were staying, and planned to borrow several rooms in the old Ministry of Foreign Affairs building for typists and translators of documents. The commissioners held a meeting this morning to discuss organizing materials and decided to hold a meeting every morning to allocate the day's work. This afternoon, the French representative went to the French Embassy for a banquet, the German and American representatives went to the American Embassy, the Italian representative went to the Italian Embassy, and Lytton and his staff went to the British Embassy and returned to the Beijing Hotel. (Special telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e12">Lytton and Others to Go to Qingdao Tomorrow <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) A Reuters reporter interviewed Lord Lytton today, who said that he and the Italian and German investigators would go to Qingdao on Wednesday evening to inspect. The Chinese and Japanese accompanying staff will also likely accompany them. They will arrive in Qingdao on Thursday evening and plan to return the following night, so they can return to Beiping on Saturday. He also said that the location for the Investigative Commission to spend the summer and prepare the report will be decided after returning from Qingdao. It is currently believed that Dr. Wellington Koo will accompany Lord Lytton and others to Japan, but it has not yet been decided for sure. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Beiping on the 5th, Lord Lytton, who arrived in Beiping at 9:05 PM on the 5th, stayed at the Beijing Hotel and told a Chinese reporter who visited him that he planned to travel to Qingdao by land with a member of the Investigative Commission in a day or two. If time permits, he plans to depart on the 6th to inspect the area and then return to Beiping to organize the investigation materials. He will leave Beiping around the 20th to go to Japan, and then return to China to choose a location to prepare the report. However, the location has not yet been decided. (Dentsu telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e13">Wellington Koo's Remarks After Arriving in Beiping <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wellington Koo gave a speech saying that the suffering of the people of the Northeast is unimaginable to those in the interior. Their love for the country is no less than that of the people in the interior. When the Investigative Commission returned from Harbin to Shenyang, a full-scale student rally was held in front of the Yamato Hotel, with thousands of people marching with Japanese and Manchukuo flags. Most of them were Japanese students shouting slogans and singing loudly. All of our students were downcast and disheartened, which was truly heartbreaking. The representatives' actions in the Northeast were all monitored. Plainclothes detectives followed them whenever they left. 30 million people are in an extremely painful and unfree position, mainly because the people are too disorganized. People like Martin and Ligiang fought bravely, but they had strong enemies in front of them and no support in the rear. Transportation was controlled by others, and they could not contact each other. To preserve the Northeast and fight, many people die every day, and we cannot help them, which is truly heartbreaking. The Japanese control Xinlun, Guanzhong and other schools above the secondary level, and the military occupies them. The Japanese have revised elementary school textbooks. This is a root-and-branch approach. In five or ten years, the relationship between the youth of the Northeast and China may be completely unclear. The so-called government agencies only have one or two Japanese advisors who hold all the power, but Chinese people come forward to show the world. The Japanese army has greatly increased its efforts to suppress resistance. The Northeast will soon completely secede from China and become a source of aggression in the interior. The northwest and southwest will both be in danger. The survival of the country depends entirely on real strength. A large land and a large population are not enough to guarantee safety. I hope that the people of the country will wake up quickly. If they still do not make efforts, they will all suffer the tragedy of national subjugation. (Special telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wellington Koo told reporters this afternoon: (1) The Investigative Commission plans to spend two weeks in Beiping organizing investigation materials; (2) Lytton will go to Qingdao, Weihaiwei and other places within days to inspect and select a location to prepare the report; (3) It was previously decided to prepare the report in Beidaihe, but this has not been resolved due to Japanese opposition; (4) The final report of the Investigative Commission will have to wait until after returning from Japan; (5) Japanese communication agencies are spreading the word that the Japanese oppose my accompanying them to Japan. The truth and purpose are unclear. (Special telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Liu Chongjie, the former Spanish envoy who recently accompanied the Investigative Commission from Manchuria back to Beiping, said that although he felt all kinds of pain during this trip, it was very beneficial. Representative Koo disregarded danger and only knew how to move forward, and his ability to endure and remain calm was admirable. The other side gave us all kinds of difficulties and verbal attacks. From a political standpoint, this is the behavior of the other side, and a third party will make a fair assessment. We can only do what we can. Changchun and the north were controlled by the other side. The number of accompanying staff was reduced from 20 to 5, and someone was monitoring them at all times and in all places. We had to work hard and keep secrets. The difficulties of our situation were well understood by the people of the Northeast. Although Ma Zhanshan was not met, he and Ding Chao, Li Du and others fought hard in the north, which was inspiring. There were also some people who provided us with investigation materials, and their positions were humble, but their patriotism was sincere and worthy of respect. However, the most profound stimulation to my conscience was seeing people in distress and not being able to save them. Now, instead of asking how to recover the Northeast, it is better to ask how to save the 30 million compatriots in China who are already in dire straits. We should now share our responsibility, actively and jointly find ways to save them. (Special telegram, 5th)</p>

<p>When the British House of Commons met in London today, Conservative MP Erskine Bolst asked the Foreign Secretary to pay attention to the obstruction of the Lytton Investigative Commission in obtaining evidence in Manchuria and whether the government would lodge a protest. Foreign Secretary Simon said that he had not received a factual telegram on this matter and did not know that the Investigative Commission had suggested to the League of Nations that a protest should be lodged. He also said that he had asked the British Chargé d'Affaires in China to provide a report on the suspension of the boycott of Japanese goods movement in Shanghai. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the simultaneous resignations of Soong Ziwen and Chen Mingshu, Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and other important government figures have had important consultations on this matter. They all agree that the country is in a critical period and needs the central figures of the government to unite and work together to overcome difficulties. Even a slight scattering will have more repercussions. Although they all sympathize with each other's political suffering, the current crisis is urgent and it is not the time for individuals to shirk responsibility. They have sent separate telegrams to comfort and urge them to continue to take responsibility, maintain the foundation of the central government, and not to rush into a lofty retreat. Lin Fangxi also sent a telegram to Wang and Chiang advocating for sincere efforts to persuade them to stay. (Special telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei summoned Luo Wenkan and Chen Gongbo to his private residence on the morning of the 6th to discuss important matters. Wang then went to the Military Committee to visit Chiang. At 2 PM, Luo visited Wang again for a long talk. Chiang visited Wang on the morning of the 6th to discuss the resignations of Soong Ziwen and Chen Mingshu. It is said that the result of the conversation was that they jointly telegraphed Chen and Soong to comfort them. It is also heard that Wang originally planned to go to Shanghai to comfort them in person after receiving the telegrams of resignation from Soong and Chen, but he did not do so immediately due to busy political affairs. If Soong and Chen still do not express their willingness to accept the retention efforts, they may send external Luo, Shi and Chen representatives to Shanghai to personally persuade them to stay. (Special telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is heard that Chen Mingshu's resignation is firm and he has telegraphed the Ministry of Communications Secretariat to expedite the handover. Vice Minister Chen Fumu is also planning to submit his resignation to the Executive Yuan again to resign from his position. Chen Mingshu's resignation is very firm. Chiang entrusted Interior Minister Huang Shaohong to go to Shanghai several days ago to persuade him to stay, but when Huang arrived in Shanghai, Chen had already left for a mountain tour on the pretext of visiting the Ersha Islands and had not yet met him. A certain commissioner talked about Chen Mingshu's resignation, which is ostensibly due to the postal tide, but in reality, it contains the meaning of relinquishing his position to a person recommended by Sun Ke in order to ease the feelings between Nanjing and Guangdong. Chen has no objection to his colleagues in the government. (Special telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is heard that after Communications Minister Chen Mingshu submitted his resignation, he immediately went to Shanghai and did not inform anyone of his address to show his determination not to return to office. Chiang Kai-shek sent a representative to Shanghai to visit him, but he could not find him. It is heard that Chiang and Wang are now trying their best to find him and plan to persuade him to return to office. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the government urged him to stay, Finance Minister Soong Ziwen has agreed to remain in office. The government has telegraphed Communications Minister Chen Mingshu, who is currently in Shanghai, asking Soong to withdraw his resignation and not to rush into retiring during this time of national crisis. It is not yet known whether Soong has complied. It is heard that the government has allowed Soong to handle financial matters freely so that he can strive to unify the finances of the various provinces. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>丨Demanding Arrears丨</p>
<p>Accept Student Demands and Resume Classes</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 6th, all professors at Central University went on total leave due to their inability to obtain arrears for December. Furthermore, the unfairness of the method of issuing 50% of May's salary on the 5th, with some people actually receiving the full amount, prompted the university's professors' association to announce that all professors would take total leave from today onwards. Later, the professors' association decided to accept the students' demands and reluctantly resume classes, but they still requested the university authorities to announce the details of this salary distribution and to clear the arrears for December by the 15th, otherwise they would have to take total leave again. Acting President Liu agreed to pay half a month's arrears for December on the 9th. It is heard that there was a fierce dispute between the two factions at the professors' association meeting this afternoon, and even clothes were torn. (Special telegram, 6th)</p>

The reasons for the transfer of the 19th Army to Fujian were: (1) The army has strong combat capabilities and is familiar with the geography of Fujian.</p>
<p>(2) The people of Fujian have repeatedly sent representatives to petition for the deployment of the army to alleviate the suffering of the people.

<p>Yamaoka Urges Recognition of the Puppet State</p>
<p>In Order to Restrain the Actions of the League of Nations</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo, 6th - According to reliable sources, the cabinet will formally consider appointing a high-ranking official to unify the administration of the Japanese in Manchuria in the near future. The original proposal was to place the army, the South Manchuria Railway, the consuls, and the Governor-General of Kwantung under the control of one person, but the Ministry of Colonial Affairs strongly opposed including the Governor-General of Kwantung. Therefore, it is expected that the Governor-General of Kwantung will remain independent, and the rest will be under the control of one high-ranking official. The person may be a military officer or a civilian official, but during the restoration of security in Manchuria, he will also serve as the commander of the Kwantung Army.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - At 8:30 this morning, Governor Yamaoka of the Kwantung Office met with Prime Minister Saito and urged him to expedite the recognition of Manchuria in principle. Regarding the quadrumvirate politics, he strongly advocated expanding the authority of the Governor of the Kwantung Office and placing various administrations such as diplomacy, transportation, education, and health under supervision. The Governor of the Kwantung Office should be a military officer,</p>
<p>assisted by a civil official, so that the administrative impact can be unified immediately.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - The army hopes that the military officer who is the commander of the Kwantung Army will be the Governor-General, and a director-general of political affairs will be set up under him. It will recommend General Muto Nobuyoshi as the Governor-General, Lieutenant General Ueda Kenkichi as the Chief of Staff, and Nagata Hidesujiro, the mayor of Tokyo, as the Director-General of Political Affairs.</p>

<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - The rural relief problem</p>
<p>is the most serious problem in Japan's internal affairs. Its success or failure is related to the fate of the cabinet. The Saito Cabinet is also painstakingly studying countermeasures. Today, the Japan Imperial Agricultural Association gathered more than 100 representatives of agricultural associations from all over the country to the Diet to demand relief. At the same time, the National Rural Youth League took the initiative to launch a major movement across the country, advocating that rural debts (approximately 60 million yuan) be suspended for three years, and the principal and interest will be repaid after the rural economy recovers. This movement seems to be spreading like wildfire across the country. Currently, more than 30,000 people have signed up in favor. The results are worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 6th - Farmers are increasingly resentful due to economic difficulties. Representatives of 120,000 farmers in northern Japan plan to directly appeal to the Emperor for speedy relief. A delegation of thousands of people visited the Speaker of the House of Representatives today and complained that successive governments have said that relief plans are under consideration, but they have ultimately failed to deliver. The farmers are now suffering unspeakably and have reached the end of their rope.</p>

It is heard that if the negotiations are successful, the French representative is willing to provide loans to the "Manchurian government" to improve the road, and then negotiate loans for other legitimate commercial and industrial undertakings. However, they do not want to discuss loans for political purposes.</p>

<p>Observations by the Russian Newspaper</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 5th - Today, the Soviet Russian Red Army's newspaper published a lengthy article commenting on the Japanese military situation and expressing doubts about whether Japan is prepared for a large-scale war. The article carefully analyzed the Japanese military situation and came to the conclusion that even if the Japanese navy and army can have the greatest effectiveness, it is still questionable whether their sustainability is commensurate with their effectiveness. Japan's agricultural production is too small to cope with a large-scale war, and it is extremely difficult to maintain the equipment and supplies of the army. All the winter clothing required by the Japanese army must be imported from abroad, which will cause economic difficulties. Maintaining the supplies for cavalry horses is even more impossible.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Santiago, Chile, 5th - Santiago, Chile, remains quiet today after yesterday's incident, and residents appear to be indifferent to this bloodless revolution. The new government established by Davila, the revolutionary leader after the departure of President Montero, has announced its extreme socialist policies and intends to adopt a collective farming system to relieve unemployed workers. It will also implement progressive socialist measures such as national management of industries and public utilities, loans, construction of public housing, and heavy taxation of private property. The largest nitrate company in Chile, worth US$37.5 million, will be liquidated and reorganized. Furthermore, since the establishment of the new government, its attitude towards foreigners has raised serious concerns. The government authorities have declared that all the rights and interests acquired by foreigners in Chile should be strictly managed so that the "abandoned class" can share in their benefits, and the forces of all foreign imperialism should be suppressed as much as possible. Therefore, outside observers feel that there may be a major conflict between the new government and foreign nationals in Chile in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Conspiracy to Assassinate the Prime Minister <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 5th - In recent times, there have been a series of major assassination cases around the world. Recently, a plot to assassinate Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was discovered by the police here yesterday afternoon. At that time, the police saw a suspicious person near the Prime Minister's residence, the Palazzo Venezia, and arrested him at the police station. Two powerful bombs and an automatic pistol were found on him. After detailed interrogation by the police, he confessed that he intended to assassinate the Prime Minister. His passport name was Chiaredini, but he later admitted that the passport was fake and that his real name was Satayrodo. He had come to Italy from Switzerland. The news shocked the entire city. The police authorities immediately ordered strict protection for the Prime Minister, the King, and the senior officials of the government. However, according to the confessions obtained so far, it is only a personal conspiracy and not the work of a secret organization. The authorities are still conducting a rigorous investigation, but another source said that Satayrodo has already confessed that he was hired by Italian exiles and had just returned to Italy from France.</p>

<p>France Shows No Signs of Concession</p>
<p>Threatens to Reoccupy the Ruhr</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 5th - The newspapers are discussing the Lausanne Conference, hinting that French troops will occupy the Ruhr area for the second time, but most newspapers are silent on this point. The fundamental question now is whether the participating countries will declare Germany bankrupt. Otherwise, France and its allies will have no choice but to occupy German territory as a sign of punishment. Former German Chancellor Bruening once declared in the Reichstag that Germany would never pay reparations again. This statement made France uneasy. Since the establishment of the new German cabinet and the dissolution of the Reichstag, the situation has become even more serious. According to the Hague World Court, if any creditor country applies to the court for its opinion that Germany deliberately defaulted, Germany must abide by the court's judgment. Therefore, if it is found that Germany deliberately intends to undermine the Young Plan and the countries retain freedom of action, then there may be punishment. The methods of punishment vary. Before the Thierry Government resigned, it had already discussed</p>
<p>declaring Germany bankrupt. Another approach is to occupy the Ruhr area, which the left-wing government is extremely reluctant to do unless it is absolutely necessary. What can be noted now is that the government has not made any concessions to Germany. People are now paying close attention to the development of the Lausanne Conference.</p>

<p>Only Hope Lies Not in the Central Government But in the Volunteer Armies - Harbin Correspondence: The Loss of Thirty Million Square Miles of Northeastern Territory</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The occupation has already lasted for more than eight months. During these eight months, apart from the rise of the volunteer armies in northern Manchuria who are fighting the Japanese army, there has been almost no news of any action from the Party and the State. It seems they intend to leave the thirty million people of the Northeast to suffer under violence and ignore their plight. The thirty million people of the Northeast are anxiously hoping for the recovery of their land and to escape from the depths of misery. However, what is heard here is only that internal strife is about to break out and that the marshals are preparing to suppress the communists. Therefore, those with patriotic aspirations, despite their courage, have no external support or internal connections. Moreover, they are under the oppression of the Japanese forces and must hide to protect themselves. As a result, the general public hates the cruelty of the Japanese, but resents the indifference of their motherland even more. As for the members of the Kuomintang who previously advocated leading the people, since the incident, some have fled to Tianjin and Beijing, while others have taken positions among the officials of the puppet regime, living their lives as secretaries and staff. These people often excuse themselves as avoiding disaster, which is truly lamentable. Under these circumstances, in order to prolong their lives and preserve their property, the people of the Northeast have no choice but to submit and be at the mercy of others. Therefore, a consul of a certain country stationed in Harbin told someone that none of the people of the Northeast wish to abandon their motherland, but their government has abandoned them. This is truly the truth. At present, the only hope of the people lies not in the central government, but in Ma Zhanshan, Li Du, Ding Chao, Feng Zhanhai, Wang Delin, Li Haiqing, and other leaders of the volunteer armies. They especially hope that Ma and others can form a grand alliance and recover the lost territories. What is concerning is that although the volunteer armies are numerous, they lack supplies, equipment, and ammunition. Their systems are complex, leading to each army acting independently. Ultimately, this situation is due to the central government's neglect of the Northeast. Otherwise, if special envoys were sent to secretly direct and reorganize the armies, implementing disciplined and planned long-term resistance, even if the lost territories could not be recovered immediately, it could restrain the enemy from leisurely devouring our land. The mountains and forests of Jilin and Heilongjiang are where many of the armies are familiar with the terrain. Adopting guerrilla tactics has already been effective. In the future, when the green sand barriers rise and the undergrowth becomes dense, even if the enemy has airplanes and cannons, they will be useless. As evidenced by the recent activities of Wang Delin and Liu Wankui's National Salvation Army on the Harbin-Suifenhe railway line, who move freely and the Japanese army can do nothing about them. Moreover, the Japanese army is already tired of running around and is especially worried that the failure of spring farming in various places will leave farmers and workers unemployed, starving, and inclined towards communism. Therefore, the 10th Division of Hirose Hisasuke was not enough, and the 14th Division of Matsuki Naoaki, who participated in the Shanghai battle, was transferred. The brigades of Murai, Suzuki, Amano, and Hiramoto were also placed under Hirose's command, with a total strength of about 70,000 to 80,000. The military pressures from outside, while the military police control urban politics from within. They coordinate with each other, planning to complete the conquest of the Northeast in the shortest possible time. As a result, the political and military center of gravity has now completely shifted to northern Manchuria. Li Du and Ding Chao's Self-Defense Army, after being attacked by the Japanese army with a division's strength, retreated from Yilan to Jiamusi. Unable to stand in Jiamusi, they moved on to Baoqing. Wang Delin and Liu Wankui's army retreated to the vicinity of Mudanjiang Hailin Station. Although these two armies are still holding on, there are no battles. Currently, the Japanese are focusing their efforts on Ma Zhanshan's Heilongjiang army. It is reported that Ma's forces are gathering their elite troops and fighting along the Hulan-Hailun railway line. Li Qingshan's forces are advancing obliquely from Zhaozhou to support Ma's army. Battles have been fierce in recent days. The vanguard of the Japanese army crossed Suihua, and fierce fighting took place at Nihe. In short, only the volunteer armies are supporting the remaining inch of land in the entire Northeast. It is unknown how the central government can be at ease with itself. (1st)</p>

<h3 id="e99">The Imminent Danger of a Japanese-American War <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from Four)</p>
<p>What I urgently want to say now is that when the Manchurian Incident broke out last year, a dark cloud was already hovering over Japan-US relations. When the Japanese army prepared to bomb Jinzhou, the internal situation in the US government became even more tense. President Hoover convened an emergency meeting and telegraphed the US Consul General in Harbin, Hanson, to rush to Jinzhou. Secretary of State Stimson also issued a statement in the name of the US government prohibiting the attack on Jinzhou. After Jinzhou was occupied by the Japanese and the Japanese army entered the city, the US government changed its previous high-sounding rhetoric of upholding its own rights and interests and the Open Door Policy and went on to strongly advocate respecting the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. It issued a note to China and Japan, directly pointing out that Japan's actions violated the treaties, saying, "Japan's actions that violate the treaties give the United States the right to destroy the Washington Naval Treaty. All countries in the world should cooperate to impose moral sanctions on Japan, forcing Japan to completely return the stolen goods to China." The potential for a head-on conflict with Japan was already emerging. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Incident broke out again. Americans who had been relatively silent were greatly alarmed and began to fiercely attack Japan, unanimously advocating the exclusion of Japan and regarding Japan as a savage people. The Americans residing in Shanghai also greatly promoted this, bitterly denouncing the Japanese army's attack on Shanghai as a one-sided invasion by Japanese warlords. As a result, the propaganda of anti-Japanese news throughout the United States intensified, and the attacks on Japan were almost without end. By March 11, when Manchukuo was established, the anti-Japanese sentiment was like adding fuel to the fire. Stimson, with the support of public opinion, sent a formal document to Senator Borah, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to support his tough stance. Others, such as former Secretary of War Figa, President of Columbia University Butler, and President of Harvard University Lowell, strongly advocated an economic blockade against Japan and proposed radical measures to punish Japan. For a time, public opinion throughout the United States surged, and the anti-Japanese sentiment was almost more intense than during the Spanish-American War in 1898.</p>
<p>However, after Stimson's declaration, the attitude of the US government suddenly became silent, which is truly incredible. I now speculate that there are two major concerns behind their change to a silent attitude: (1) Lack of unified public opinion; (2) Insufficient naval power. From Japan's standpoint, predicting the future relationship between Japan and the United States has already reached a point of caution. The facts provided by recent world history show that Japan's current situation is similar to that of Germany after Krachling's time. The trajectory of history is likely to result in the same fate for Japan and Germany. From July 1911, Krachling's time, to August 1914, when the European War broke out, there was only a three-year interval. Therefore, predicting the future conflict between Japan and the United States, starting from the Shanghai Incident in January 1932, may brew until 1935, and various uneasy situations will occur at that time. Because 1935 is the time for the Second London Naval Conference. In the decision of the First London Naval Conference, Japan has already complied with the 60% ratio to the United States, but in the Second London Naval Conference, the two countries will inevitably experience turbulence. If the Second London Naval Conference breaks down, the plenipotentiaries of Japan and the United States will inevitably walk away. At this time, a new situation will inevitably form in the Pacific, causing significant disputes. However, what kind of environment will Japan be in around 1935? On the other side of the Pacific, the United States, as a result of the First London Naval Conference, its powerful navy, or as Admiral Pratt said, "the real navy is enough to threaten Japan at the time." At this time, the United States will inevitably use various excuses to bring up the old issue of Manchuria and create difficulties for Japan. US Secretary of the Navy Monsell once said that the new naval base in Singapore, operated by the British Yarrow company, is scheduled to be completed in 1935. If this major naval project is completed, it will definitely guard the southern sea route of Japan. The entrance of the Strait of Malacca will isolate Japan in the Far East. It is doubtful that Britain today and Britain in 1935 will exert the same pressure on Japan. Moreover, the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan in 1935 will also be completed, and they will also rise up to exert their fierce pressure. At this time, Japan will inevitably fall into a dangerous and difficult situation to decide the fate of the country.</p>
<p>I have silently observed the actions of the United States after the Manchurian Incident and have formed the following foolish opinions for judgment. Looking at the past history and the confrontation between Japan and the United States, it has spanned thirty years. During this time, issues such as the exclusion of immigrants, the Twenty-One Demands, the Shandong issue, the Siberian intervention, and other various difficult issues have followed one after another. The relationship between the two countries has been like fire and water, and it has always felt difficult to coexist. The crisis of rupture has long been imminent. The reason why it has been delayed until now and has not broken down is because Japan has always endured and restrained itself. Now, it is known that self-restraint is futile and cannot overcome the natural power that governs the human world.</p>
<p>I have investigated the causes of world wars throughout history and found that those responsible for provoking wars, in addition to the ambitious Wilhelm II, there is another person. Who is this person? It is the person who cursed Wilhelm II on the gallows and provoked the war. Because of the evil deeds of this instigator, a cruel tragedy suddenly occurred in an instant. Therefore, based on the situation in Europe, I speculate on the current friction between Japan and the United States. No matter how much we advocate and strive to maintain the spirit of peace, the result may not be able to be reversed by human effort. The antagonism between Britain and Germany, the discord between Germany and France, and the rivalry between Russia and Austria, which threatened 20th-century Europe, were already beyond human salvation. Today, the struggle between the United States and Japan has spanned thirty years and is almost reaching the same situation as Europe in the 20th century. If war breaks out between Japan and the United States, not only will the countries involved suffer endless disasters, but all countries in the world will also be drawn into the vortex and suffer the same tragic catastrophe. If we do not realize this fact, and the self-restraint of the two peoples is lost, then the outbreak of war can be expected immediately. The current attitude of the United States is quite regrettable.</p>
<p>Because they threaten other countries, tolerate the survival problems of other countries, and cannot force their own will, creating the tragic disaster of war, is within our expectations. In short, the trend of confrontation between Japan and the United States over the past thirty years has matured, and the outbreak of war is already inevitable. This is what the Japanese Empire and the Japanese people should know. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e100">Major Internal Strife Erupts <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Filthy and Ugly Behavior of the Japanese is Fully Exposed</p>
<p>The Chief of General Affairs of the Puppet State Angrily Resigns</p>
<p>Han Traitor Representatives of the Puppet Government Go to Retain Him</p>
<p>The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reported that when Commander Honjo of the Kwantung Army traveled to northern Manchuria the other day, in addition to inspecting military affairs, he also paid attention to various other matters. Unexpectedly, Komai Tokuzo, Chief of General Affairs of Manchukuo, suddenly resigned, causing a major shock within the government. The reason was that Commander Honjo, on his way south from Harbin to Changchun the other day, summoned the key Japanese figures in the Manchukuo government at the Yamato Hotel and issued a stern warning, stating that in the face of this major crisis, they must be honest and united, and move forward bravely. However, recently, many affairs have been delayed and not progressed, and the Japanese officials in Manchukuo are indulging in pleasure quarters and idling around. The decline of official discipline has reached its extreme. The frivolous rumors are unbearable to hear. He urged the Japanese officials in Manchukuo to reflect on this. After Honjo's warning, the Japanese officials who frequented pleasure quarters and acted rampantly were all alarmed. At the same time, Honjo decided to cut high-level staff, causing a great reaction within the Manchukuo government, especially Komai, the Chief of General Affairs. Komai was recommended by the military and had connections with the South Manchuria Railway system, enabling him to take the important position of Chief of General Affairs. Since taking office, he has been engaged in cronyism, establishing the Komai faction, which often clashed with other factions, leading to internal strife. As a result, affairs were neglected and official discipline was lost. Komai was familiar with Chinese customs and had almost been assimilated into a Chinese-style Japanese, and his relationship with the military deteriorated. Now, he was criticized by Honjo, and he angrily resigned. Currently, the Japanese officials of the Komai faction are trying to persuade him, saying that if Komai does not return to his post, they are all willing to leave together. The newspaper also said that Xie Jieshi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, with Honjo's permission, represented the Manchukuo government and went to Dalian on the afternoon of the 2nd to retain Komai. The position of Chief of General Affairs of Manchukuo is of great importance, not only representing the subtle relationships between the South Manchuria Railway, the Kwantung Army, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, but also holding the major responsibility of the political center of the Manchukuo government. It is not easy to find a successor among the Japanese. The newspaper also said that Prime Minister Zheng Xiaoxu of Manchukuo, because of Komai's resignation, specially summoned the chiefs of various departments (Japanese) to lecture them, saying, "The public's sentiment is shaken, and everyone should put public interests before private interests." The Japanese side, after hearing Zheng Xiaoxu's advice, immediately convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<p>The Japanese Worry About Disputes Between the League of Nations and Japan</p>
<p>The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reported that as a result of the League of Nations Investigation Team's on-site investigation in Manchuria, various cases have been collected, and the members of the committee are discussing solutions. The general intention of the committee is to resolve the issue by considering Manchuria as part of Chinese territory, using special methods. If this resolution is reported to the League of Nations, it will inevitably lead to a head-on conflict with Manchukuo. Japan, which has a special relationship with Manchuria, will also inevitably have disputes with the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Totaling Four Hundred and Ninety-Five Bags</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Since the Wuhu flood, the working group of the National Government Flood Relief Association has set up a grain station office in Wuhu, specializing in the transportation and distribution of flour and wheat for disaster relief to various counties in southern Anhui. The loose distribution and fluctuations in weights and measures have already caused considerable complaints. Yesterday, there was even an incident of selling 495 bags of disaster relief wheat, which was discovered by a boatman and reported to the Navigation Guild. The guild immediately convened an emergency meeting, sent people to investigate in all directions, and learned that the chief director, Li Siyi, had stolen 39.495 tons of disaster relief wheat and sold it to grain merchant Shao Liangfu, obtaining a price of more than 2,800 yuan. The unloading took place in the Zhonghefeng warehouse on Shangfu Bridge. The guild immediately reported to the Third Public Security Bureau to monitor Li's actions and sealed up the confiscated wheat. On the one hand, they reported to the Party and government disaster relief organizations, requesting a thorough investigation, and condemning Li's actions as tantamount to taking the lives of many disaster victims, extremely hateful. Yang Xuewu and Cheng Zilin were appointed as representatives to be responsible for reporting and accusing Li to the court. Shao Liangfu, who bought the stolen wheat, also hired lawyer Wu Lin to sue Li in court, as he had already paid the price but the wheat was confiscated. Li, realizing that his actions had been exposed, telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters, falsely claiming that he had priced the wheat in accordance with regulations, in order to cover up. (4th)</p>

<p>For Silver and Grain</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Zhang Zhen's retreat from Zhangzhou to Zhao'an is mainly intended to rely on the Guangdong army to protect himself. Zhang has sent Lin Peiran, Xiao Yuesheng, He Shijun, and others to Shantou to negotiate military affairs. He and Xiao have returned to Zhao'an to report. It is said that the plan for the Guangdong army to enter Fujian has also been decided. When Xiao left Shantou, he told people that the communists' capture of Zhangzhou was aimed at scraping silver and grain. Zhangzhou City has been extorted one million yuan, and Shima has been extorted 600,000 yuan. All shops with capital of more than 2,000 to 3,000 yuan have been confiscated. The method is to replace them with silver and grain, which are transported to Nanping and western Fujian. Currently, Mao Zedong of the communists has transferred the elite troops of the Jia, Ding, and Liancheng bandits to Longyan to control the throat of western and southern Fujian. Also, Zhang Zhen sent Lin Shuangmu and Lin Fangyu, members of the political training office of his division, to be responsible for propaganda. According to Lin et al., the bandits attacking Zhangzhou totaled five divisions. The headquarters has moved to Jinlong Mountain in Nanping, and all the communists in western Fujian have gathered in Longyan. (May 31st)</p>

<p>A Young Girl Hangs Herself After Being Reprimanded - In Cao Zhuang, Zhang Jing Bridge North, Seventh District (Huai Shang Shi), Resident Wang Sanyuan, 40 years old, is a farmer and has a well-off family. He married Li and has one daughter and two sons. The eldest daughter, nicknamed A Da, is 21 years old, beautiful and intelligent. She assists her mother in managing the household and is diligent. She has been promised to Zhou He Xu in nearby Zhou Jia Zhuang as his wife, and will be married in January of next year. Unexpectedly, the other day (5th), at midnight, she was reprimanded by her father for a minor matter. A Da had the thought of ending her life and sneaked into the room and hanged herself. Soon, her father entered the room to get something and saw A Da hanging high from the beam. He was extremely shocked and cried out. His wife, Li, heard the cry and rushed over, untied A Da and tried to save her, but she had already died. Li hugged the body and cried loudly, and then fainted. The family quickly called Chinese and Western doctors to rescue her, and she gradually woke up.</p>
<p>Rice Snatching Trend Intensifies - In Chen Xiang, Zhang Jing Bridge, Che Er Li, Seventh District (Huai Shang Shi), most of the residents are surnamed Chen, and the family is considered well-off. The other day in the evening, 30 to 40 poor people in tattered clothes suddenly came with farming tools and snatched the wheat from the field like wolves and tigers, putting it into hemp sacks. The villagers, upon seeing this, rose up to stop them and argued with them. However, the poor people were fierce and unreasonable. The villagers were very angry, leading to a fight between the two sides. For a time, there was punching and kicking, and the order was chaotic. The situation was very tense. After a stalemate of half an hour, several villagers were injured. Then, the chief of the village reported to the 14th detachment of the Zhang Jing Bridge Merchant Corps. Captain Gu, upon hearing the report, led all the corps members to suppress them. However, when they arrived at the village, the poor people had already dispersed. Only Zhou Xiaodi, Gu Zengquan, Zhu Shuangquan, Xu Aji, and Gu Quan Gen were arrested and escorted to the county government yesterday. Wang Kaiwei, the chief of the second section, opened a court to interrogate them. The criminals confessed to snatching rice and wheat from Chen Village. After the interrogation, they were ordered to be detained and await investigation. Also, the home of a certain family in Mao Zi Bridge, Tian Xia Shi, Sixth District, was broken into by six or seven thugs who tied up the owner and snatched six or seven dan of white rice and three large bags of clothes, with a loss of about 100 yuan.</p>

<p>Robbery and Injury Case in Huangtang Town: Yuan Shizhi, a farmer from Gejia Village in Huangtang Town, eastern district, was a man of modest means, long coveted by bandits. Last night, more than ten robbers suddenly arrived, speaking with a northern accent. One person first scaled the wall and entered, letting in the bandits who then searched and looted at will. They tied up Yuan Shizhi and his daughter-in-law, Yuan Chen, demanding hidden silver, but failing to get what they wanted, they shot and killed Yuan Shizhi, also seriously wounding his daughter-in-law. Neighbors, alerted, gave chase, but the bandits had already fled with a shout. At the home of Jing Dashu in Shijia Village, multiple robbers also arrived, entering by climbing over the roof. They tied up the couple and burned them with fire to force them to hand over cash, and after obtaining the loot, the robbers left.</p>

<p>Critical Situation of the Canal Project in Northern Jiangsu: The canal project in Northern Jiangsu has twenty-seven breaches, totaling more than nine hundred zhang. Since last winter, when Director Bo Xian of the Shenqian Construction Department first handled the blocking of breaches and cutting off the flow, the embankment restoration started in mid-January of this year. At that time, the Shanghai war occurred, almost halting the project. Relying on the provincial government's efforts to raise funds, and the assistance of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, as well as the National Government's Disaster Relief Commission allocating 8,600 tons of American wheat from the Industrial Rehabilitation Bureau, and with the help of Leng Yuqiu from the Post-Disaster Relief Commission borrowing 10,000 tons of American wheat from the Disaster Relief Commission, a total of over 3 million in funds was available. Han Guojun, director of the Yangzhou office, based on this plan, proceeded with the engineering step by step. Since the start of the work, it has been five months, and although there have been several reconstructed sections, it is estimated that nine-tenths are completed, and the project should be finished within June. However, recently, it was suddenly heard that the construction funds were insufficient, almost causing a halt. The reason is that Shanghai still owes wheat, and the Industrial Rehabilitation Bureau has also issued several hundred tons less of American wheat. In addition, the funds from the sale of wheat by the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce have not been fully collected. Currently, Director Chen of the Huaipi section, Director Wan of the Qingping section, Director Yu of the Gaobao Jiangxi Dike, Director Lu of the Jiangdu East Dike, and Deputy Engineer Sun of Wengjiaying have all sent people to Yangzhou to guard the funds, but the office has no way to respond. If there is no funding to continue, the success of this effort will be wasted, and the previous expenses will be in vain, and the people of Northern Jiangsu will again be submerged in a watery state. Therefore, residents along the canal and the lower reaches of the Xiang River all show worry on their faces. Yesterday, it was heard that Mr. Han visited Commissioner Wang Boling, who also recognized the importance of the matter, and urgently telegraphed President Wang of the Executive Yuan, urging him to quickly allocate funds to continue the project, to avoid the summer floods and prevent the project from being completed.</p>

<p>Reasons for Local Public Fund Deficit: The recent income and expenditure of Nantong's local public funds show a deficit of over 134,100 yuan. The Property Management Office investigated and clarified the reasons for the deficit: (1) In recent years, taxes are heavy and the people are poor, and tax revenue is decreasing daily, with only 60% collected last year. (2) The salt field tax has never been evenly distributed, and the land tax has not been approved, but in fact, it has been collected and spent in name only. (3) No funds are allocated for temporary expenses. (4) Interest on borrowed funds is increasing daily, reaching over 8,700 yuan last year.</p>

<p>Sino-Japanese Joint Committee Continued Discussions Yesterday</p>
<p>Our Side Determined to Restore Police and Political Authority First</p>
<p>Regarding the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, the Japanese side still has no definite indication regarding the withdrawal of troops from areas east of the Zhabei Songhu Railway and the Ding District. At the same time, barbed wire fences have been erected at both Songdong and Shejinggang. The news is reported in detail below.</p>
<p>Negotiation Situation: At 11:30 AM yesterday, Secretary Lang Ge of the Joint Committee visited Japanese Commissioner Okazaki. After their meeting, Okazaki immediately notified our Commissioner Yu Hongjun by telephone, informing him that the withdrawal of the Japanese Navy Marine Corps from the Ding District (i.e., the Zhabei Temporary Garrison Area) was currently being discussed with the naval authorities. At the same time, regarding the Navy Marine Corps stationed east of the Zhabei Songhu Railway and at Shejinggang, due to the concerns of the Japanese residents in these areas about panic after the Japanese troops withdraw, it is necessary to wait further.</p>
<p>Consultation with Naval Authorities: As for the small number of military police at the Tongwen Academy, Zhou Fengtian, Gongda, Huafeng, and Sansha Factory, they can also be withdrawn in the shortest possible time. After prolonged consultation, the Japanese side agreed to first restore police power, administrative power, and all municipal works in the above-mentioned areas. The rest is to await the Japanese side's reply.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun's Talk: A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Yu Hongjun at the Municipal Government yesterday, inquiring about the content of the reply. According to him, the Japanese representative Okazaki had contacted him by telephone at around 11:00 AM this morning regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops, saying that the withdrawal of Japanese troops was currently being discussed with the military authorities, but some time was still needed for procedures and preparation. However, the expected time would not be too long. Therefore, it is expected that the withdrawal of the Japanese troops in that section is only a matter of time for the Japanese side's internal consultations and should be realized within about five days and should not be delayed for too long. As for the Japanese troops at Tongwen Academy, Huafeng, Gongda, Toyota, and the yarn factories, there are currently only ten to dozens of people at each place, and the Japanese side will also withdraw them soon.</p>

<p>Resumption of Diplomatic Relations with Russia and the Roundtable Conference</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of resuming diplomatic relations with Russia and the Roundtable Conference, there has been much discussion recently. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly expressed its views, people outside the ministry are still confused. A reporter from Huadong News Agency specially visited Mr. Guo at his residence yesterday morning to inquire in detail about the overall views of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the above two issues. According to Mr. Guo, regarding the resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia, when he was in Beijing, he held a Foreign Affairs Committee meeting at the residence of Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei to discuss this matter specifically. Although most parties agreed to the resumption of diplomatic relations, considering the importance of the matter, it should be handled with utmost caution. Therefore, it was transferred to the Central Political Conference for discussion, and the Central Committee has also discussed it several times, but has not yet decided on a specific plan. However, it is firmly believed that a definite plan will be available within a short period of time. In his opinion, our country and Russia are closely adjacent and have a very long history. It is not a proper solution to cut off diplomatic relations for a long time, and both countries, government and public, are eager for the trend of resuming diplomatic relations. As long as the differences and regulations in political and economic aspects can be fully restricted and stipulated, the resumption of diplomatic relations will be very easy. The UK and France have also discussed and decided on resuming diplomatic relations with Russia several times. Our country, especially at this time when the communist bandits are rampant across the country, should strive for prudence. As for the roundtable conference that Japan is touting, it is obvious that this is a political trick by the Japanese government to deal with its own people. Since the Japanese army's attack on Shanghai was unjustified and the defeated soldiers and lost generals ended up with nothing, they were not only abandoned by world opinion but also opposed by the people of the whole country. Therefore, they touted the fallacy of the roundtable conference and the Free City of Shanghai, hoping to use this trick to shift the resentment of the Japanese people in the past and to cater to the psychology of ignorant people in various countries. As for the Free City, we can laugh it off. As for the roundtable conference, as long as it does not conflict with our position, we should be happy to promote its success. However, today, the Japanese side's opinion is not like this. They actually intend to separate the Northeast and Shanghai issues into two, and our side will definitely oppose this intention. The so-called roundtable conference is a meeting resolved by the League of Nations to resolve the entire Sino-Japanese negotiation issue. It is clearly stipulated that the Northeast Incident and the Shanghai Incident must be resolved as a whole in the conference. Today, the Japanese side does not plan this, hoping to resolve the Shanghai Incident and the Northeast Incident separately. For the Northeast Incident, they firmly declared that no third country is allowed to interfere, and their ambitions are blatantly revealed. Our country should vigorously oppose it. Therefore, as for the so-called roundtable conference, the Japanese side's attitude is like this, and the distance from our country's position is still far away. It seems too early at this time. Talking about this, the reporter then inquired about two things: (1) The Japanese side is publicizing that the Manchurian puppet state has sent two Japanese people to serve as deputy consuls in Russia. Is this statement reliable? Will this matter be an obstacle to the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia? (2) When will the Vice Minister go abroad? According to Mr. Guo: (1) Russia and the puppet state have no diplomatic relations to speak of. In fact, it is impossible for the puppet state to send consuls. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received a report on this matter. It should be a deliberate rumor by the Japanese side. (2) The time for his departure has not been determined.</p>

Security was very strict.</p>
<p>Unveiling Ceremony Details: At 10:00 AM yesterday, the opening ceremony was held in the City Chamber of Commerce Auditorium. The City Public Security Bureau Military Band played music first, followed by speeches by the chairman and representatives of various organizations. At 11:30 AM, everyone took a photo together as the music played, and the meeting adjourned. Chairman Wang Xiaolai accompanied the representative of Army Commander Cai to unveil the National Products Exhibition, while setting off firecrackers and raising the national flag for people to visit.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported that today, the Commodity Exhibition Hall of the Chamber, in conjunction with the four major national products organizations in the city, held the opening ceremony of the Shanghai City National Products Exhibition. He felt extremely honored to have received the guidance of all sectors of society. The Exhibition Hall of the Chamber was established in the tenth year of the Republic of China, which is eleven years ago. It gathers the essence of domestic products for reference by all sectors of society. In these eleven years, in addition to holding exhibitions and six temporary national products bazaars, it has been open daily for people to visit and promote national products. Furthermore, in March of last year, due to the influx of foreign goods into the market and the sluggish sales of national products, it was impossible to find a fully national products store in Shanghai, causing those who love to use national products to be at a loss. Considering that the previous Industrial and Commercial Conference had a resolution to reward the establishment of national products stores, and that national products exhibition halls in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places had already increased their numbers, it was urgent. Therefore, on the first floor of the Chamber, a permanent national products bazaar was opened, and national products factories were contacted to promote it together. After three months of preparation, it was finally completed. Since its opening, business has been quite good. It can be seen that our patriotic men and women are determined to use national products, and we are very grateful. The reason for reopening the exhibition this time is that after the January 28th Incident, national products factories in Zhabei were few due to the war. Fearing that it would be difficult to recover after the destruction, we hope to come back again. We hope that our patriotic people and compatriots across the country will not be lazy and will be encouraged again. The Chamber is in charge of promotion, so we are thinking about how to encourage and guide it. In the midst of discussions, on April 26th, we received a letter from the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, stating that when manufacturers are tired, foreign goods can take advantage of the opportunity to enter, which is worrying, and asking us to design a plan to expand publicity and actively awaken the public with a common will and a spirit of cooperation. The Chamber believes that we have the same goals and cannot shirk our responsibility. After deliberation, we joined forces with the China National Products Maintenance Association, the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, the Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Union, and the Shanghai National Products Factory Union to organize the Shanghai City National Products Exhibition, with the aim of encouraging production, consumption, supply, and demand, and guiding men, women, old and young. Although the scale is rough, there is room for improvement, and the equipment seeks to be comprehensive, hoping to attract people to national products. Therefore, we classify them by category and display them in the room, listing the prices and names to indicate the criteria. The purpose of the initiative is this. The 6th of this month happened to be the anniversary of the National Products Bazaar, so the Chamber opened it on this day for one month, and a sales department was set up in the exhibition on the second floor to sell cheap domestic products. We hope that patriotic men and women will come and visit enthusiastically and promote it, so that we can expand it and fill Shanghai, and the people's livelihood can be revived. After the exhibition is over, we plan to reorganize the national products bazaar on the second floor to make it permanent. Furthermore, we are honored to have Army Commander Cai Tingkai attend the meeting and perform the unveiling ceremony, and to have the representatives of the Ministry of Industry Tang Huoshu and Mr. Chen Kecheng of the Municipal Government, and Director Yu of the Social Affairs Bureau give speeches. The Chamber feels very honored and sincerely thanks them, and hopes that people from all walks of life will give criticisms and promote it widely, which is especially welcome.</p>
<p>Fan's Speech: Then, Fan Qiwu spoke on behalf of Army Commander Cai, saying, "Today, the Shanghai City National Products Exhibition is holding its opening ceremony. Army Commander Cai originally wanted to participate in person, but due to the busy affairs of the military department, he was unable to do so. Therefore, he sent me as a representative to participate in this National Products Exhibition. In my personal opinion, I believe that the Chinese people are happy to use and promote national products. The reason for this is that everyone loves themselves. Looking at all countries in the world, no matter which country, they all pay close attention to their own industry and commerce in order to develop and prosper. For example, the increase in tariffs is nothing more than to resist the influx of foreign goods and protect the sales of domestic goods. How should the production of domestic goods in our country be gradually developed in the future? In short, there are two points: (1) Entrepreneurs should do their best to invent and reform to increase production and improve products. (2) The people should especially like to use domestic goods and fully promote them to make them sell well. Although we know that the current products of our country cannot be compared with foreign goods, we should still take patriotism as a prerequisite and take wearing and using domestic goods as glory. We must know that the development of industry and commerce cannot be achieved in one day. Especially in our economically backward country, we should encourage ourselves and each other. Furthermore, a large part of the raw materials of the products in the national products stores are imported from foreign countries. Therefore, some people point out that they are not domestic goods, but this is too harsh. It is not known that the products of various countries are not necessarily all produced in their own countries. Therefore, we can only hope to gradually study and replace them with domestic products. If a kind of domestic product must be produced entirely in our own country before it can be considered a domestic product, it seems very difficult in fact. In short, to promote domestic goods, the government and the people must fully cooperate. The government is responsible for protection, and the people are responsible for promotion. Only then can the people be rich and the country be strong. It is not to say that the people are rich and the country is strong, and everything depends on military force. Finally, I hope that after the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce has done its best to promote it, the future of domestic goods will be improved day by day, so that it will not be in vain to hold today's grand event."</p>
<p>Speech by the Ministry of Industry: He Bingxian, Deputy Director of the International Trade Bureau, representing the Ministry of Industry, said, "Chairman and everyone, today is the opening day of the Shanghai City National Products Exhibition. I am very honored to be sent by the Ministry of Industry to participate as a representative. I just listened to Chairman Wang's report on the preparations, and I admire everyone's past efforts very much. Holding a National Products Exhibition is a very meaningful thing, especially at this time of national crisis, with the Northeast fallen and northern Shanghai destroyed, it has a more far-reaching meaning. Since September 18th of last year, when Japan began to occupy the three eastern provinces, we have seen the terms airplanes, bombs, artillery, and tanks, etc., in the newspapers every day, as well as the tragic state of our compatriots in the Northeast losing their country and homes. By January 28th of this year, Japan re-enacted the old trick of the night attack on Shenyang in Shanghai. Therefore, the terms that we only saw in the newspapers before, we now see with our own eyes and hear with our own ears. The tragic state of our compatriots in distress that we only saw in the newspapers before, we are now directly or indirectly experiencing. This deep impression is not easy to erase. But we must know that there are two kinds of wars. One is military war, which is what we have experienced since January 28th. The other is commercial war, which we have been experiencing every moment since we were oppressed by imperialism. However, the weapons used in commercial war are not airplanes, artillery, and tanks, so we cannot see the fierce images of bloodshed and flames. Therefore, many people, although they have been experiencing it every day since they were born, do not feel it. In fact, this kind of commercial war that drains the marrow and kills without seeing blood is a hundred times more tragic than military war. The failure of military war is the loss of the country in politics, and we can still seek to restore it slowly. The failure of commercial war is the loss of the country in economy, which is irreversible. Therefore, we must resist military war, and we must resist commercial war even more. The weapon of military war is guns, so we use guns to resist it. The weapon of commercial war is goods, so we use goods to resist it. Speaking of this, I really feel very painful. Since our country has been trading with foreign countries, imports have exceeded exports every year, and this proportion has become larger year by year. The import surplus in the first year of the Republic was more than 21.301 million taels, and by the twentieth year of the Republic, it reached more than 55.985 million taels, an increase of more than two and a half times. Just from the first year of the Republic to the twentieth year, the amount of import surplus in our country has reached more than 39.1223 trillion taels. This is really an alarming number. If we use this money in the country, then there will be great reforms in military affairs, industry, transportation, internal affairs, education, and society. Our country will not be so poor and weak now. But the money has flowed to foreign countries, so our country's rural areas are bankrupt, industry is declining, and commerce is on the verge of death, living completely under the breath of imperialism. Now, our country's national economy has reached the point of bankruptcy. Are we going to sit and wait for death? Don't we want to get up and find a way to resist? Last time, when our 19th Route Army resisted the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, the people of the whole country, especially the people of Shanghai, rose up to help. It can be seen that the people of the whole country are in favor of resistance. This is certainly not just for military invasion, but also for economic invasion. Because no one wants to suffer the loss of their country and home. Since we have determined that we should resist foreign economic invasion, what should we say to resist now? Our country knows that what foreigners use to invade China is goods, so we use goods to resist them. In other words, it is to revitalize domestic goods and replace foreign goods. I really do not believe in that purely idealistic theory, thinking that Chinese people should only use Chinese goods in any situation. Yes, this is certainly 120,000 points should be, but should be one thing, the fact is another thing, human nature, who does not love beautiful, convenient and cheap things, this human desire knows the principles of war, the principles can not be maintained for long, we have resisted British goods, resisted American goods, Japanese goods, but also resisted many times, but can not last, just take this deeply painful experience to resist Japanese goods, now the newspapers have daily news of large amounts of Japanese goods imported, in North China, and obviously selling Japanese goods, some people have criticized Chinese only five minutes of heat, which is human nature, any kind of nation, in this situation, can not avoid this phenomenon, if we recognize this point, then we can fundamentally seek remedy, otherwise, just talking on paper, the result is still following the previous failure, the fundamental reason is what, is to improve domestic goods, we have to put the advantages of foreign goods, are in domestic goods, and try to increase production in order to popularize, above I have said that people's common psychology, on the one hand for foreign economic invasion is holding a resistance attitude, on the other hand, it is difficult to long overcome the temptation of foreign goods, this psychology, seemingly contradictory, but people's hearts, is really this, we can only use this psychology, then we can succeed, I said above, revitalize domestic goods, in order to resist foreign economic invasion, but only in revitalization on the idea, is still not able to achieve the purpose, because a kind of goods, if you want to popularize, must first everyone know, foreign goods, pay attention to propaganda, the advertisements in our country's newspapers and magazines, almost more than half are foreign firms, that is, as the international trade bureau out of the industry and commerce half-monthly publication, a month ago, the inside of the advertisement, nine tenths are foreign businesses, in addition, Nanjing Road and companies, and other large stores, almost became a display of foreign goods, our government, the surface is certainly also set up a few national goods exhibition hall, but on the number of equipment compared, there is really a world of difference, therefore we have to seek remedy, the National Goods Exhibition is a way to remedy, the venue set up a variety of national goods, on the one hand for national goods propaganda, arousing the Chinese people's knowledge and interest in domestic goods, on the other hand can also arouse domestic capitalists, for the revitalization of domestic industry determination, in terms of psychology, that is, on the one hand to increase the Chinese people's determination to foreign economic invasion, on the other hand, and give people the impression of the advantages of domestic goods, so that he naturally does not want to buy foreign goods, this significance is very important, absolutely not that kind of passive propaganda can do, so we can say, the National Goods Exhibition, is an economic war weapon showroom, we have a resistance determination to foreign economic invasion, today arrived at this military showroom, I hope everyone carefully study, see what is the extent of our military and foreign comparisons, saying that to know yourself and know the other, a hundred battles wins a hundred, I wish us all to this point efforts, today I will this point significance, written, I wish this Shanghai City National Goods Exhibition to success,"</p>
<h3 id="e115">Zhenru Market Opened Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Baowei Tuan (Militia) Members Arrested Were Released on Bail Last Night</p>
<p>The merchants and residents of Zhenru, angered by the Municipal Public Security Bureau's arrest of Wang Shouyu, head of the Baowei Tuan, and others, due to a kidnapping case, went on strike the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday, municipal commissioners petitioned the municipal government and other agencies, securing their immediate release on bail. The merchants and residents accepted the advice to resume business first. Details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Traitor Missing: During the Japanese occupation of Zhenru, the Japanese appointed the traitor Shen Songge as the chairman of the Zhenru Local Maintenance Association, acting as a puppet and mistreating the citizens in every possible way. On May 23rd, at 11:00 AM, after the Japanese troops withdrew, our forces took over at 2:00 PM that afternoon. Around 1:00 PM, the citizens, filled with hatred, detained the traitor at Yangjia Bridge in Zhenru and then released him. At that time, the Public Security Bureau and the Baowei Tuan were busy restoring order and could not attend to this matter. Later, his wife, Shen Mu (also known as Mu Guiying), reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau that her husband, Shen Songge, was missing and his whereabouts unknown, accusing Wang Shouyu, head of the local Baowei Tuan, Zhou Xilian, the first squad leader, Gu Jinbao, the second squad leader, Xu Peinan, the independent squad platoon leader, and members Huang Chungeng, Gan Yuhong, Cai Qirong, Pan Jinkui, Zhao Xianshan, squad member Fu Zhongmin, clerk Yang Asi, and Li Xiaoshi, the firefighting director of the fire brigade, of kidnapping.</p>
<p>Arrest with Evidence: After receiving the report, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Yingxing, considering the case involved kidnapping, assigned it to the Detective Squad. The squad leader, Lu Ying, ordered detectives to take Shen Mu's servant, surnamed Yang, as a witness and drove to Zhenru to make arrests on the morning before yesterday at 7:00 AM. They first went to the Baowei Tuan headquarters at Xianghua Bridge. As Wang Shouyu and the squad leaders were out, they arrested Huang Chunxiang, the owner of Yichangxiang Foreign Goods Store and member of the Baowei Tuan, and Fu Zhongmin. They then went to the residence of the head of the Baowei Tuan at Xigang Dam, took a photo of Wang Shouyu, and questioned his nephew, Wang Zhixian. Next, they went to the residence of Zhou Xilian on Beida Street and arrested his brother, Zhou Xiwangsheng, before releasing him on bail. They also went to the residence of Xu Peinan, the independent squad platoon leader at Yuji Water Plant on Jiaotong Road, but failed to apprehend him. They then returned to the bureau to report.</p>
<p>Town-Wide Strike: All 242 stores in Zhenru, including Zhang He Tai, Ding Tai, Yixin Sauce Garden, Shengji Renhao, Wang Changhe, Zhang Deyuan, Ding Xin Tai, Tai He, Zhi Xiang, Gan Caishan Tang, Sheng Chang Xiang, Yi Chang Xiang, Qia Xing, He Xing, Bao Xie Ji, Yan Yuan Feng, and Pu Cheng Ji, believed that Wang Shouyu and the other eleven members of the Baowei Tuan were all reputable merchants. During the recent war of resistance against Japan, they made significant contributions to the rear supply of the army, and their merits were widely acknowledged. Outraged by the traitor's false accusations, they collectively went on strike at 2:00 PM in the afternoon to support them and sent representatives to plead with Wang Binchan, the head of the Shanghai North Baowei Tuan, and others to find ways to rescue them.</p>
<p>Rescues from All Sides: Wang Binchan, the head of the Shanghai North Baowei Tuan, Hong Lanxiang, the municipal commissioner of Zhenru, and Yang Fuyuan, the head of the Caohejing Baowei Tuan, went to the Municipal Government to see Mayor Wu Tiecheng yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, as the day before yesterday was a Sunday and government offices were closed, requesting him to send someone to investigate thoroughly and bring the truth to light. The Secretary-General, Yu Hongjun, received them and promised to instruct the Public Security Bureau to investigate. The original petition is recorded as follows: A petition for reporting matters. Wang Shouyu, head of the Baowei Tuan in our district, and eleven other squad leaders including Tong Xilian were falsely accused of being kidnapping bandits. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, members of the Detective Squad of the Public Security Bureau came to Zhenru to arrest them. As Wang Tuanzheng and Zhou DuiZhang were out on official duty, the squad members went to Wang’s house to search, took a photo of Wang, and took away Huang Chungeng and Fu Zhongmin, two members of our town’s Baowei Tuan. The merchants and residents of our town believe that Wang and others are enthusiastic about local public welfare, protect the township, and have made great contributions. Now they are groundlessly accused, which causes great panic. We request that the two arrested people be released first, and that the accusers be punished in return. Wang is also a municipal commissioner of this town, with a substantial family fortune and careful in his work. I have worked with him for many years, and I immediately sent someone to comfort him. I specially report to you, please send someone to investigate thoroughly and check whether there is any suspicion of framing, so that the truth can come to light.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>I await your orders with urgency.</p>
<p>Persuading to Reopen the Market: At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent Deputy Inspector-General Jiang Baixiang to Zhenru to persuade the stores to reopen. He, along with the director of the West District Third Sub-Bureau and business representatives Xu Yizhou and Yang Yiqing, persuaded them to reopen the market first. Huang Chungeng and Fu Zhongmin, the arrested members of the Baowei Tuan, were allowed to be released on bail and to be summoned at any time. However, this would have to be decided after consulting Director Wen in the afternoon. After repeated persuasion by Deputy Inspector-General Jiang, all the stores temporarily reopened for business at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. However, if they still could not be released on bail in the afternoon, they decided to go on strike again the next day.</p>
<p>Efforts to Secure Bail: Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Zhenru Municipal Commissioner Hong Lanxiang and business representatives Yang Diankui and others went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to secure bail. They prepared letters of guarantee from the Municipal Committee and the Baowei Tuan headquarters, as well as documents from thirty stores including Zhang He Tai and Yang Wanshun, jointly certifying Wang Shouyu and the other eleven members of the Baowei Tuan. Wu Zhiquan, the chief of the Third Section, received them. The letter of certification is recorded as follows: Director, greetings. We, the people of our district, are indignant about the case in which Wang Shouyu, head of our district’s Baowei Tuan, was falsely accused by Shen Songge, the chairman of the Maintenance Association under the Japanese occupation. Wang has always been fair and selfless. During this war of resistance against Japan, he made great contributions to the rear supply of the Nineteenth Route Army, and his merits are widely acknowledged. We all deeply admire and support him. Moreover, Wang has a substantial family fortune and would never engage in illegal activities. We hereby jointly certify that Wang is a loyal and dedicated person, and we take full responsibility. We ask you to investigate and acknowledge our public sentiment. We respectfully offer this letter and wish you good health.</p>
<p>Welcoming Release from Prison: Wu Zhiquan, chief of the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, allowed Huang Chungeng and Fu Zhongmin to be released on bail without interrogation, as they had just been brought in from the Inspectorate. He scheduled a hearing for 2:00 PM this afternoon to determine the truth. Commissioner Hong then transported Huang and Fu back to Zhenru by car. All the citizens, having heard the news in advance, waited at the back gate and other places to welcome them warmly. The stores set off firecrackers. Huang and Fu expressed their gratitude to those who welcomed them and returned to the Tuan headquarters to resume their duties.</p>
<p>District Meetings: The Municipal Baowei Tuan Reorganization Committee sent Adjutant Yu Yuanjue to investigate yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Furthermore, the Baowei Tuan headquarters of Wusong, Pengpu, Caojing, and other districts, in order to protect the service personnel of the Baowei Tuan, have reportedly scheduled a meeting to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>Various Industries</p>
<h3 id="e116">Deliberating on the Reconstruction of the Disaster Area <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Decided to Establish a Trade and Industry Rehabilitation Association</p>
<p>Petitioning the Government to Exempt the Disaster Area from National Taxes</p>
<p>Merchants from various industries in the disaster-stricken areas of this city, in order to seek the revival of industry and commerce, gathered at Yipinxiang Western Restaurant at 7:00 PM the night before last to discuss the process. They decided to organize a Disaster Area Trade and Industry Rehabilitation Association, and to petition the National Government to exempt the disaster area from national taxes, and issued a declaration. Details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Qiu Liangyu and Cao Zhaoguang of the Shanghai North Road Merchants General Federation, Li Ruzhang of the Paint and Woodware Industry Association, Zhou Shiheng of the Bookstore Industry Association, Zhang Dalian of the Sauce and Liquor Industry Association, Luo Shouxian of the Ice Factory Industry Association, Cheng Guichu of the Face Powder Industry Association, Gu Yixiang of the Cotton Ginning Industry Association, Hu Yuantang of the Restaurant Industry Association, Che Lisheng of the Rickshaw Industry Association, Jin Guifu of the Fresh Meat Industry Association, Lu Zhankui of the Umbrella Industry Association, Pan Xusheng of the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association, Xiao Zheming of the Pawnshop Industry Association, Xie Zhongle of the Flying Flower Association, Zhong Yibo of the Jiangwan Branch of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Yuzhi of the Wusong Branch of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and over a hundred others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Ye Jiaxing, elected as chairman, reported, "I have invited everyone here today because you are all leaders of various industries in the disaster area. Since the January 28th Incident, when the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, and other places have been turned into scorched earth. The once prosperous and thriving commercial districts have been reduced to ashes. The estimated losses are over 160 million yuan, which is truly appalling. Now that the war has ceased, these areas have been successively taken over. The most important thing now is to handle the aftermath and revive industry and commerce. The Municipal Government of this city has already organized a Disaster Area Relief Committee to be responsible for handling the aftermath, which shows that the government also has a strong desire to revive the destroyed industry and commerce. However, for the revival of industry and commerce in the disaster area, merchants who have personally experienced the pain should rise up to rescue and revive their own industry and commerce. It is essential to unify our steps. First, we should ask the government authorities to find ways to provide relief. Second, we should find ways to revive the disaster area that has been turned into ruins. For example, those who have borrowed money from banks and money houses are now heavily indebted and cannot continue to do business. All of these should be provided with relief so that their debts can be gradually repaid and they do not fall into a state of stagnation. We need to invite experienced and reputable people to assist us. Today, I ask everyone to express their opinions and work together to achieve the goal of revival."</p>
<p>Important Resolutions: (1) Resolved to establish the Shanghai Disaster Area Industry and Commerce Rehabilitation Committee; (2) Resolved that the committee should consist of 21 members, and nominated Ye Jiaxing, Zhang Yuzhi, Jin Guifu, Zhong Yibo, Wu Zhonggao, Zhang Dalian, Luo Shouxian, Jin Wenxiang, Xiao Zheming, Qiu Liangyu, Zhou Shiheng, Gu Yuantang, Xie Zhongle, Xia Xiaofang, Pan Xusheng, Chen Songyuan, Cheng Guichu, Li Ruzhang, Yuan Hongjun, Zhu Yiqian, and Cai Qiajun as members; (3) Resolved that Ye Jiaxing should be the convener of the first executive committee meeting; (4) Resolved to petition the National Government to issue relief bonds for reconstruction; (5) Resolved to petition the National Government to exempt the disaster area from national taxes until it recovers to the pre-war state; (6) Resolved to petition the Municipal Government to exempt the disaster area from all local taxes until it recovers to the pre-war state; (7) Resolved that the association should issue a declaration, and nominated Yuan Hongjun, Zhou Shiheng, and Sun Mingqi to draft it.</p>

<p>Japanese Navy Frequently Fires Guns for Demonstration</p>
<p>Residents Start Moving Out in Alarm</p>
<p>Around 8:45 AM yesterday morning, about 50 to 60 fully armed Japanese naval marines in four military vehicles turned from Jiaotong Road onto Zhongshan Road and drove east. It was reported that these Japanese soldiers were from the Toyota Cotton Mill. Also, at 11:50 AM, a vehicle with about 20 armed Japanese naval marines drove westward on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei. Recently, the Japanese navy stationed here often fired guns in demonstration at night. Two gunshots were heard near Zhongxing Bridge the night before last, causing rumors to spread in the Zhabei area. Yesterday afternoon, it was widely rumored that there was a conflict between Japanese troops and the police. Residents became alarmed and even started moving out. In fact, all of these were unfounded and mere rumors.</p>

<p>The Dragon King Temple in the Sanjiashui area outside of Wusong is a must-pass for foreign ships coming to Shanghai. In 1927, due to the attack on the Wusong Fort by the Haiqi ship of the Northeast Fleet, the military and political authorities set up two cannons there and stationed more than 40 artillerymen. This time, it was destroyed by a Japanese warship. The reporter and a friend passed by the area the day before yesterday. As the destroyed cannons had not yet been removed, the reporter recorded the situation as follows: The cannon was manufactured by the Jiangnan Cannon Factory in the year of Guimao in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. The cannon was about 1.5 zhang long and had a caliber of 4.6 chi. It was destroyed at 3:00 PM on February 3 this year. The two cannons lay horizontally on the seawall, with the cannon mouths facing south. One cannon was hit by a Japanese warship in the middle and was broken into two sections, causing the front section to be thrown more than 2 zhang into the field. The rear of one cannon was hit, causing the tail to be destroyed. The cannon base was built of cement, in the shape of a millstone, and was destroyed by Japanese aircraft.</p>

<p>Wang Xiaolai's Letter to Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, sent letters to various trade associations yesterday, stating: "The outbreak of the Shanghai Incident shocked the world. Thanks to our patriotic soldiers, who resisted to the death and fought bravely, killing countless enemies for more than a month, the loyal sacrifice of the soldiers is of great significance to the country, and the people should reward their merits and promote virtue, and should urgently provide relief to their families to fulfill the responsibility of those who survive. This is why the Bereaved Families of Fallen Soldiers Fostering Association was established in a timely manner. However, the association has been established for almost two months, and the measures for fostering the bereaved families need to be implemented urgently. Raising funds is particularly urgent. I have long admired your association's concern for the national crisis and its deep sympathy. The work of the association needs your attention.

<h3 id="e122">Distributing Relief Rice to Impoverished Households in Jiangwan Regularly <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>In order to provide relief to disaster victims, the Jiangwan District Disaster-Stricken Compatriots United Association sent personnel to the countryside to investigate impoverished households and use it as a standard for providing relief. They also stipulated a review standard based on five items: houses, property, population, fields, and pre-disaster living conditions, dividing them into three levels, A, B, and C, in percentage terms. 408 households (extremely poor) were approved for level A, with 735 adults and 522 children; 263 households (less poor) were approved for level B, with 674 adults and 236 children. The Relief Committee of the Association has decided to distribute 100 bags of relief rice from the Catholic Church in Hongkou first, stipulating 6 sheng for adults and 4 sheng for children in extremely poor households, and 5 sheng for adults and 3 sheng for children in less poor households. The distribution date is from June 7 to 10. After the distribution is completed, the Lianyi Xiang Association will continue to distribute relief according to the register of impoverished households investigated by the Association. It is reported that after these two distributions, the living conditions of the households in the A category can be barely maintained. In addition to appropriating 250 bags of rice for the relief of the A and B categories, the remaining will be used for the relief of the C category households.</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Flood Relief Association Allocates Relief Funds Discretionarily <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Continued Loan of American Wheat Did Not Materialize</p>
<p>Zhu Ziqiao, Director of the Work Group of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, stated that although the committee had purchased 450,000 tons of American wheat and distributed more than 7 million yuan in relief funds and cotton clothing, the disaster area was too large and there were too many disaster victims, so it was insufficient to provide relief. At this time of scarcity, although Chairman Song intended to continue to borrow 100,000 tons of American wheat to help the disaster victims, as soon as this proposal was made, requests for allocation from various disaster areas came one after another. Due to the difficulty of raising funds in China and the recent situation of American finance, the issue of continuing to borrow American wheat ultimately became a pie in the sky. Director Zhu still believes that in the areas with the most severe disasters, there are indeed disaster victims who cannot survive without relief. He made every effort to scrape together funds and allocated them at his discretion to the provinces with the most severe disasters, such as Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei, to eliminate the tragedy of starving people in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Zhu Ziqiao, Director of the Flood Relief Association of the National Government, received a letter from Zhuang Songfu, Vice-Chairman of the Huai River Commission, stating, "Respectfully, our commission is actively implementing the Huai River project and is in urgent need of funds. I still ask Wang Jinmin to go forward to claim the American wheat. I beg you to show your inexhaustible benevolence and fulfill the contribution. The project depends on it to succeed, and the achievement is immortal. Please also read the two telegrams of May, respectfully praising and admiring by Liang, the commander-in-chief of the Twenty-Fifth Route Army, for sponsoring the Huai River project. It is enough to see the beauty of turning swords into plowshares." According to the two telegrams of Liang Guanying, commander-in-chief, (24th) respectfully praising and (29th) admiring, they are related to the issue of engineering troops assisting in guiding the Huai River.</p>

<p>The China National Christian Council at No. 23 Yuanmingyuan Road in this city, in addition to handling national church cooperation affairs, also cares about social service undertakings. In the past, during the drought in the Northwest, the council collected more than 2 million yuan in donations from churches across the country and asked voluntary experts to handle emergency relief and work relief, such as dredging rivers and building embankments. Disaster victims benefited greatly. Last year, during the floods in various ports along the Yangtze River, churches across the country once again competed to be the first to donate. As of the end of May this year, in addition to donating more than 200,000 yuan to American churches through specialized committees for relief, it directly received more than 156,000 yuan in donations. The funds were allocated for emergency relief in Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces through local church groups, and work-for-relief programs were implemented. Agricultural relief loans were also launched in these provinces, with Chinese and Western experts responsible for investigation and guidance, so that farmers could obtain loans to purchase agricultural tools and seeds for cultivation. Also, when the Japanese soldiers attacked Shanghai, during the two or three months, churches from various places sent money to the council, asking for relief for wounded soldiers and refugees. As of now, a total of about 12,000 yuan has been used for refugees and about 6,000 yuan has been used for wounded soldiers. More than 1,000 yuan was directly sent to the Nineteenth Route Army to provide relief to wounded soldiers. It is reported that the expenses of the council for handling various disaster relief work, such as staff salaries, stationery, and other expenses, have never been deducted from the relief funds. Even the salaries of the personnel who personally went to the disaster area to handle relief work were paid separately by the local church groups. All donations can be used for disaster relief, so the council has won the trust of churches at home and abroad.</p>

<h3 id="e133">This Year's Second Cholera Report <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Ten Deaths Last Week</p>
<p>Wu Liande of the Harbor Quarantine Office, yesterday released this year's second cholera report, which is recorded as follows: (1) Last week (ending June 4th), there were 92 cholera cases in this city (including 10 deaths). The numbers are presented in the table below:</p>
<p>District Number of Cases Number of Deaths</p>
<p>Shanghai City 55 6</p>
<p>International Settlement 27 3</p>
<p>French Concession 10 1</p>
<p>Total 92 10</p>
<p>The number of cases this week, combined with the previously reported total, is 190 cases. (2) The new patients discovered last week are scattered in various hospitals. Their numbers are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Epidemic Hospital 70</p>
<p>Emergency Epidemic Hospital 11</p>
<p>Haig Road Refugee Hospital 1</p>
<p>Shanghai Public Hospital 2</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Isolation Hospital 8</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai hospitals have long been preparing more than a thousand beds to accommodate patients. The Shanghai Municipal Council Isolation Hospital can accommodate 200 people, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road can accommodate 150 people, the Emergency Epidemic Hospital can accommodate 200 people, the Red Cross Epidemic Hospital can accommodate 150 people, and the newly established Infectious Disease Hospital at the French Concession's Guangci Hospital can accommodate 30 people. It is hoped that the health authorities of all sectors can accommodate cholera patients as much as possible when necessary. (4) Four notable cases of cholera patients are briefly described below: A. Ito Hidejiro, a Japanese national, 35 years old, residing on North Sichuan Road, contracted the disease on May 26th and was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council Isolation Hospital on May 29th. Bacteriological examination confirmed cholera, and he died the next day. B. A Japanese patient named Miki, 34 years old, came to Shanghai from Osaka and stayed for several days. He contracted the disease on May 31st and returned to his country on the Shanghai Maru mail ship. On June 3rd, he arrived in Kobe, where the local health authorities confirmed through bacteriological examination that he had genuine cholera. C. Sailor Wu Da, 42 years old, arrived in Shanghai from Australia on the Sydneyia ship on May 18th. On May 28th, he was sent</p>
<p>to Renji Hospital and then transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Council Isolation Hospital the next day. Cholera was confirmed, and he died on June 2nd. At that time, the ship was inspected by the Harbor Quarantine Office and strictly disinfected and fumigated before departing for Japan on June 4th. D. A Russian patient named Sunuvich, 42 years old, came to Shanghai from Tianjin. He contracted the disease on May 27th and was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council Isolation Hospital, where he died on the 30th. (5) The Red Cross Epidemic Hospital, located opposite the Racecourse near the New World, will open on June 9th, and we will have another 150 beds to accommodate patients. (6) Within the past week, Nanjing reported 5 cases of cholera, and Hankou reported 20 cases, including one death. (7) On May 14th, the Dutch East Indies declared Shanghai a cholera-infected port, followed by Singapore on May 21st. (8) Recently, there has been much discussion attributing the cause of cholera transmission to the dumping of sewage into the Huangpu River. According to scientific theory (this should not be considered the main cause of transmission; in other words, sewage itself cannot cause cholera, and the transmission is actually caused by the excretion of cholera patients or carriers). An examination of the water source of the Shanghai Waterworks Company shows that the water is taken from the best part of the Huangpu River. It would be better to improve it slightly, especially before filtration. However, the majority of Shanghai's poor have no way to obtain pure drinking water. The more residents in this harsh environment, the more unmanageable the situation becomes. From this perspective, Shanghai's health authorities and other charitable organizations must urgently seek remedial measures to eradicate this epidemic. (9) There has been progress in vaccination work. The number of injections administered is as follows:</p>
<p>District April May</p>
<p>Shanghai City None 97,117</p>
<p>International Settlement None 27,855</p>
<p>French Concession 4,125 9,118</p>
<p>Total 4,125 134,190</p>

<p>With Over Five Hundred Beds</p>
<p>After this year's observation, epidemics are certain to be numerous. The Shanghai Ji Yi Charity Association, in view of this, and because Hongkou is densely populated with factories and civilians, and many died during the war, the association's directors Mai Yaoting, Zhu Meixian, Jin Tingsun, Li Quancai, Zhou Yongsheng, Jing An, and others, enthusiastically initiated the organization of the Shanghai Ji Yi Charity Association Hongkou Epidemic Hospital. They have now found 40 to 50 rooms next to the Chengzhong School on Tangshan Road in Hongkou as the hospital site, which can accommodate over 500 beds. Doctors Baodeli Bian Lishi (Westerner) and Lin Chunshan, Zhu Xiaofang, etc., who are experienced in treating epidemics, have been hired. Preparations are currently underway, and it will open soon to benefit the common people, which is truly not frivolous. However, the hospital's expenses are all raised by the initiators themselves, requiring a vast amount of funds. It is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will sympathize and contribute generously.</p>

Finally, the chairman reported that the landlords of the Derun and Furun neighborhoods and Hongxingfang on this road, Shunli Company, had voluntarily exempted all rents for February and March, and the rent for April has been temporarily suspended, with tenants issuing IOUs to be repaid in six installments starting from January next year. Regarding other rent reductions, we will wait for the municipal government to have a concrete solution before deducting them. It was generally agreed that the rent reduction and exemption measures should be notified by the association to all members to be implemented uniformly.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Tenants on Dongmen Road Write to Discuss Rent Calculation Methods <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Rent Calculated at 8% of Land Value and Construction Cost</p>
<p>Since the reconstruction of Dongmen Road from the merging of Jishui and Fangbang Roads in Nanshi, the rent for the houses has increased several times. Recently, after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, businesses have suspended operations to resist the enemy. Although peace has been declared and the market is recovering, the losses of the businesses have been enormous, and the exorbitant rent makes it difficult to maintain operations. The Dongmen Road Business Community Tenants' Association has been formed and sent letters to the landlords yesterday, stating, "To Whom It May Concern: In order to revitalize the municipal administration and enhance prosperity, the local authorities merged Jishui and Fangbang Roads and reconstructed them into Dongmen Road. The people of Shanghai consider its situation superior and its location important, giving it the beautiful name of 'Model Road.' However, its commerce has become inversely proportional, and it has not seen much improvement compared to the former Jishui and Fangbang Roads. Since the Shanghai Incident, it has become even more deserted, and several businesses are even considering closing down. More than a dozen new houses are empty. We are alarmed by this situation. Upon investigation, the amount of rent has increased several times or even dozens of times compared to before, which is far from the current business situation. Whether in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, the level of housing rent has always depended on the prosperity of the land, industry, and commerce. There has never been a case where industry and commerce are not developed, but the rent can be increased alone. If this principle is reversed, industry and commerce cannot prosper, and how can municipal administration develop? It is tantamount to driving oneself to suicide. Moreover, the houses on this road are mostly small and cramped, only suitable for small and medium-sized businesses. The huge rent is beyond their financial capacity. Therefore, the houses on this road that have not been rented out are not inquired about, and those that have been rented out are in a situation where they cannot maintain their operations. The deserted market shows the reason for this. On the landlords' side, although there is a huge rent income, the obstruction of municipal development and the vacancy of houses result in losses that outweigh the gains. For the sake of the future of the municipal administration, the prosperity of this road, the interests of the landlords, and our own operations, we have jointly formed this association to achieve a consistent goal through legal procedures. Since rent is closely related to municipal administration and commerce, its increase or decrease must conform to the times, adapt to the environment, and consider the economic strength of the citizens to deliberate and revise it. The houses that have been built for several years and have not been rented out, the landlords have now realized and voluntarily reduced or exempted the rent. The fairest method is to follow the regulations of the municipal government from the previous year and calculate the rent at 8% of the combined value of the land and construction cost. We are based on this standard, and we have prepared a table estimating the rental value of this road, and we have generously included depreciation over ten years, and all insurance and repair costs are added in. We hereby send this letter representing the consensus of the tenants on this road, along with the table (omitted). We hope that you will consider and respond accordingly."</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Zhabei Local Post-War Research Association, requesting the removal of obstructions on North Xizang Road and other places to facilitate traffic, etc. The Chamber forwarded the letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council for processing. The Chamber has now received a reply from the Municipal Council stating that the barbed wire between North Xizang Road and Haining Road has been removed, and the iron gate has also been opened. The barbed wire at the end of North Zhejiang Road is also being dismantled. As for the Wuzhen Road Bridge, it was previously opened during the day. The issue of removing the barbed wire in that section is also under consideration. This letter is sent in response for your information.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Yan Yutang Escapes Danger <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The New World Gains a Suspect</p>
<p>A Large Number of Military Supplies Seized from the Bandit's Den</p>
<p>Yesterday the Main Perpetrator of the Kidnapping was Investigated</p>
<p>All Auditions are Strictly Prohibited</p>
<p>Yan Yutang, the owner of the Dalong Iron Factory and the Suzhou Lensa Factory at the end of Xiaoshadu Road, lives at No. 1 Pingliang Road in East Shanghai. In addition to the above two factories, Yan also runs a real estate business and founded Guangyu Business Company at No. 58 Guangdong Road and Jiangxi Road. On the morning of the 4th of last month, at 8:45, Yan took his own car No. 8967 to Guangyu Company to work. Just as he arrived at the entrance of the company, he was suddenly kidnapped by several bandits who demanded a ransom of 500,000 yuan. Yan's family reported to the police and requested an investigation. More than a month has passed, and there has been no news. Until about 11:30 the night before yesterday, Lu Liankui, the Chinese Chief Inspector of the General Patrol Department, received a tip-off that several bandits involved in the case were hiding in Room 337 of the New World Hotel on Xizang Road. Inspector Lu immediately dispatched Chinese Inspector Liu Shaokui, Detectives Feng Zhiming, Wang Chengying, Zhou Honglin, Wu Changkai, Yin Zhanqing, Shen Tianbao, and others to the hotel. They opened another room, No. 336, opposite Room 337, to monitor the actions of the occupants of the room. After investigation, it was found that the people in the room were highly suspected of being involved in the Yan case. Therefore, Wang Jian from Zhenjiang, Kong Ali from Ningbo, Chen Huixing from Jiangbei, Dong Xiaosi, and Ye Xianglian from Pudong, five people in total, were arrested and taken to the police station. Under questioning, Liang was identified as the main perpetrator of the Yan kidnapping. Wang Jian also confessed that the hostage was hidden at No. 72 Baier Shao Road and Pushi Road in the French Concession. Inspector Lu and others immediately cooperated with Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession Police to rescue him. However, the bandits guarding the hostage had already fled after hearing the news. Yan Yutang was found locked in the room. The detectives immediately rescued Yan and seized three Mauser pistols, 163 bullets, one handgun, 31 bullets, one gas pistol (pen-style), and two bottles of narcotics in the house, and brought them all to the police station. Yesterday morning, Wang and others were escorted to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division 1, where Judge Qian Hongye presided over the trial. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested the court to prohibit audience during the interrogation, because the case was serious and the main criminals had not been arrested. He feared that Wang and others might reveal the main criminals during the interrogation and leak secrets. Judge Qian granted the request, so the details of the interrogation could not be recorded. It was found that Yan Yutang had been kidnapped unsuccessfully in September 1928. Yan's chauffeur, Mr. Jia, was shot and wounded by bandits. This was the second time he had been kidnapped.</p>
<p>Ma Er, a Murderer and Robber</p>
<h3 id="e143">Ma Er Executed by Firing Squad <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Ma Asks to Notify His Father to Collect the Body</p>
<p>Obscene and Disrespectful Language to Detective Cai</p>
<p>Ma Er, 28 years old, from Tongzhou, nicknamed "Little Yellow Hair," was a chauffeur for Chinese Detective Cai Zhitian at the Huishan Police Station. On the midnight of September 18th last year, he and his accomplices broke into the home of Zhu Liangshan from Qingpu at No. 196 Dongxi Huade Road, killed Zhu's relative, Madam Gu Tan, and the maid, Zhou Luo, and stole property worth 1,038 yuan. The case was solved and the perpetrators were arrested by Detective Cai, and Ma Er was sent to the First Special District Court where he confessed clearly and was sentenced to death. After the approval of his superiors, yesterday morning was the date of execution. The police escorted Ma to the Third Court, where the executing Judge Fu presided over the session. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, ordered the police to present Ma Er to the court. The judge asked him if he had any last words and if he wanted to send a letter to his family. Ma said that his father's name was Ma Hongkun, and he lived at No. 1312 Longqing Lane, Ti Lan Qiao. He asked to be notified to collect the body. He also used obscene and disrespectful language towards Detective Cai. Judge Fu then ordered him to be sent to the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate for execution according to law. The Chinese and foreign police officers escorted Ma, along with the case files and photos, in a car to the Caohejing execution ground. The prosecutor appointed by the local court arrived at the scene, verified Ma's identity, and ordered the judicial police to bind him and execute him by firing squad according to law.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Extortionists in a Hurry <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Arrested Near the Train Station</p>
<p>A Tailor is Suspected of Writing the Letter</p>
<p>Chen Yushun, the manager of Yuantaiheng Seafood Store at No. 15 Yanghang Street in the French Concession, previously received a threatening letter signed "Li," demanding 10,000 yuan and arranging a meeting at the Nanyang Hotel in Xiaodongmen on the 3rd of this month. At that time, Chen sent Xu Jingfu as his representative to meet the extortionists, He Yongli and Zhou A'ming from Ningbo, but the negotiations failed. The meeting was rescheduled for that evening at the Nanyang Hotel on North Zhejiang Road. Chen again sent his cousin, Jiang Lianfu, to the meeting. Upon arrival, Jiang found only one extortionist, He, in the room, and he suddenly became bold. He turned around and went outside, called the police, and had He arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation, etc. It has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Zhou was originally with He that evening, but Zhou was acting as a lookout outside the hotel. When He was arrested, Zhou immediately fled, and thus escaped. The next day, at 2:30 PM, Zhou led his wife and a girl to the North Train Station, intending to flee to another port. His hurried appearance was noticed by a detective stationed on the street, who immediately arrested him and took him to the Huisi Police Station. Under interrogation, he fully confessed and revealed that the person who wrote the threatening letter was hiding at No. 265 Tangshan Road. Detective Shang immediately took Zhou to the address and arrested a tailor named Qi Deguang from Liangji. He was taken back to the police station and confronted with He and Zhou. However, Qi insisted that he had never met the two men and had never conspired to send threatening letters. The police chief ordered him to be detained temporarily. Yesterday morning, Zhou and Qi were escorted to the First Special Court, where Judge Feng Shide presided over the trial. First, the police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, recounted the incident and requested that Zhou and others be detained for further investigation, and that a formal indictment be filed together with He, who had been arrested previously, after the investigation was completed. Then, Detective Shang reported the circumstances of the arrest of the two men, and Chen Yushun sent Xu Jingfu to the case to state the circumstances of the negotiations with He and Zhou at the Nanyang Hotel in Xiaodongmen. During the negotiations, the two men said that they needed to borrow 10,000 yuan, otherwise they would do something unfavorable to Chen Yushun. Chen Yushun asked them who the "Li" who signed the letter was, but the two men said that Li was their teacher and was very famous. Chen asked them to introduce them to him, but the two men refused. Since the negotiations were unsuccessful, they rescheduled for later that evening, but Jiang Lianfu went to the negotiations at night, and Chen did not know the details. Zhou A'ming confessed that the threatening letter was written by He. In the afternoon of the 3rd, Zhou went to He's house at No. 624 Xipuyi Lane, Qipu Road. After He went to Xiaodongmen and met with Xu, Zhou learned what He had done. Because the negotiations were unsuccessful, Zhou and He returned home together. He said that since the other party did not agree to give the 10,000 yuan, they should increase the amount, so he wrote another letter demanding 50,000 yuan. He initially ordered Zhou to send it, but because Zhou declined, He personally took the letter alone to Room 3 of the Nanyang Hotel on North Zhejiang Road that evening, intending to ask Jiang Lianfu to pass it on to Chen Yushun. In the afternoon of the 4th, after Zhou was arrested and taken to the police station, He whispered to Zhou during the detective's interrogation, begging Zhou to admit that the letter was written by him, and he would give him 400 yuan. Zhou said that he had a minor grudge against Qi Deguang in the past, so he took the opportunity to falsely accuse Qi of writing the letter, but in fact, Qi had nothing to do with it. Then, Qi was interrogated, and he still swore that he had no association with the gangsters. Judge Feng then ordered Zhou and Qi to be remanded in custody for further trial together with He Yongli.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Strict Suppression of Prostitution <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Pimps and Brothel Owners to Hold a Regular General Meeting</p>
<p>To Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>Since the arrival of Commissioner of Police Fébvre in the French Concession a few months ago, in addition to strictly prohibiting opium and gambling, he has also actively suppressed various prohibited activities such as prostitutes and streetwalkers forcibly soliciting customers. Every day, he dispatches a large number of Chinese and Annamese police, traveling in patrol cars to arrest people everywhere. At night, plainclothes detectives are sent out, disguised as coolies, to continue the arrests, with fines and other punishments imposed. Therefore, those engaged in the profession are all worried, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. In the past, when the lanterns were first lit, groups of women in pink and green lined the streets, but now they have completely disappeared, creating a desolate scene unprecedented in the history of the concession. Brothel owners and meat market bosses, seeing that the business has declined sharply recently, and fearing that it will be difficult to maintain the status quo if this continues, are said to be planning to convene a general meeting of all pimps and brothel owners before the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>To consider countermeasures. It is noted that there was previously an organization called the "Pingkang Guild" in the French Concession, with the chairman being a famous brothel owner named Wu, which was quite large in scale, like a legal institution. However, Wu enriched himself during his tenure and was soon reported, so Wu fled, and the large-scale Pingkang Guild also disappeared as a result. As for this general meeting of pimps and brothel owners, it is said that they will expand the organization and try their best to save the critical situation.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Verdict in the Security Gun Tax Company Case <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Shen Changlin and Others Sentenced Separately</p>
<p>Previously, someone illegally established a "Security Gun Tax Company" at No. 8 Bulinli, Avenue Edward VII, specializing in protecting illegal opium dens and collecting gun taxes daily. As soon as preparations and registration began, the French police detective discovered the company's fraudulent fundraising scheme. He immediately dispatched detectives to arrest seventeen staff members, including Zhang Shengfu, and confiscated signboards, books, registration certificates, stationery, and other items. They were sent to the Second Special District Court, and the police prosecuted them for the crime of jointly defrauding money under Article 363 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Zhang Chaozuo held two hearings and thoroughly investigated, the defendants, defended by lawyers Jin Yu and Wang Shizong, etc., were declared to have completed the trial and set a date for sentencing. Except for Zhang Shengfu and Wang Guihua, who were released on bail, the others were returned to custody to await instructions, as previously reported. The presiding judge has now carefully reviewed the confessions of the defendants and, based on the severity of the circumstances, has prepared a judgment. Yesterday was the date for sentencing. The bailed defendants, each accompanied by their representative lawyer, arrived at the court to await instructions. At 10 a.m., Judge Zhang arrived at the First Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought to court. After briefly questioning their ages and occupations, the judgment was pronounced. Shen Changlin, Yu Xueming (i.e., Yu Heming), and Lin Ganzhong were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment for attempted fraud, and each fined 400 yuan. Zhang Shengfu, Fang Ziqing, Shi Guifu, and Chen Baorong were each given a reduced sentence of one month of imprisonment for assisting in attempted fraud, and each fined 200 yuan. Yu Gansheng, Wang Hengchun, and Wang Guihua were each fined 100 yuan for assisting in attempted fraud. Zhang Debao, Song Bolin, Wang Kailiang, Luo Aquan, Han Huangjin, and Zhou Lansheng were each fined 30 yuan. If they are unable to pay the fines, they will be converted into one day of imprisonment for every two yuan. The number of days of detention before the verdict is finalized will be used to offset the sentence at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment, or one day of detention for two yuan of fine. The copied case books, lead plates, small copper plates, registration certificates, and seals and stationery will be confiscated according to the list. Du Arong is innocent.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Zhou Chunshan Died Happily After Smoking Opium <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Why Did He Swallow Opium?</p>
<p>The Cause Should Be Investigated</p>
<p>On the 3rd, at around 11 a.m., Zhou Chunshan, a tea merchant from Suzhou, 23 years old, went to the Jiangsu Hotel on Guangdong Road with Xu Xiuying from Shen'an, 26 years old, and booked room 102. The woman went out at around 12 p.m. When she returned to the hotel at around 1 p.m., Zhou ordered a bowl of noodles from the tea boy, Shan Amao. After eating, the two went out together at around 3 p.m. to buy a pair of women's shoes and returned to the hotel at around 5 p.m. At around 8 p.m., the woman saw that Zhou's face was pale, so she called the tea boy and others to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly after. The hospital reported this to the Lao Zha Police Station, and the police sent detectives to investigate. They found a bag of opium under the bed in the room and carried the body to the forensic laboratory on Félan Road. Yesterday morning, Li Ying, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the laboratory and confirmed that the body was Zhou Chunshan. According to Xu Xiuying's confession, she met Zhou on the road, and he asked her to go to the hotel with him. Zhou was from Suzhou, and she had known him for more than three years. She knew nothing about him taking poison that day. After obtaining the confession, Mr. Li ruled that the deceased, Zhou Chunshan, was a male who had committed suicide by taking poison during his lifetime. The body was temporarily handed over to the Pushan Cemetery for collection pending collection.</p>

<p>Chen Tang Was Unlucky in Marriage</p>
<p>Chen Amao, a 25-year-old electrician from Nantong, married Tang (18 years old) from the same village last winter. They lived at No. 31 Lixing Lane, Jiangyin Street, outside the South Gate. After the marriage, they lived peacefully at first, but recently, Chen lost his job and stayed at home, while Tang worked in a tooth powder factory to maintain their livelihood. The night before, Chen gambled outside, and when he returned home, Tang advised him, and the couple quarreled. Yesterday morning, Tang still went to work at the factory, but returned at around 10 a.m. due to feeling unwell. At around 11 a.m., a female companion visited Chen and Tang's house. She called but received no answer. Suddenly, she discovered Chen Tang had hanged herself in the kitchen. The woman was shocked and screamed loudly. Neighbors gathered and tried to save her, finding her chest still warm, hoping to save her. They tried various methods of rescue, but to no avail. Soon, her body turned cold as ice, and there was no way to bring her back to life. The local police station ordered Tao Xingsheng, the local guard of the 27th Precinct, to report to the local court for an examination. At 5 p.m., Prosecutor Zhao, accompanied by Coroner Shen, arrived at the scene and confirmed that Chen Tang had committed suicide by hanging and that there were no other reasons. They filled out the death certificate and ordered the husband, Chen Amao, to provide a coffin and await instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Appeal from the Workers of the Sanyou Company <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union sends a telegram (titles omitted): Looking back to the restoration, the Sanyou Industrial Company used a capital of several hundred yuan to manufacture candle wicks. When the May Fourth Movement occurred, people throughout the country regarded promoting domestic goods as their duty. The Sanyou Industrial Company seized the opportunity to rise and expand in response to the times, recruited capital, organized a limited company, and added the production of triangular brand towels to resist the disappearance of imported goods. Since then, the annual profits have been hundreds of thousands of yuan. The company has flourished and achieved today's success. On the one hand, the company has been good at planning and operation, but on the other hand, it is also due to the hard work of all our workers in production. Since the establishment of our union five years ago, we have not only strictly observed the factory's discipline and never caused any disputes, but also stepped up production and strived for the company's development. The facts are there, and there is no room for denial. However, in 1929, the company recruited additional capital and opened a branch factory in Hangzhou, but regarded the main factory as a burden, getting rid of the old to bring in the new, all with the intention of reducing the wages of the main factory workers. Their malicious intentions are obvious. Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the main factory has announced a temporary shutdown, and more than a thousand workers in our union have lost their livelihoods and become displaced and homeless. For four months, we have repeatedly sent representatives to request relief, but the company authorities have repeatedly evaded and refused to accept it. Although the Social Affairs Bureau has repeatedly ordered them to provide relief, the company has refused to comply. When the Japanese troops had just withdrawn, the company dismantled important machinery in the factory and transported it to the Hangzhou branch factory. When the workers noticed this, they had already transported a considerable number of parts. All members of our union, with their livelihoods at stake, tried to stop them, but the company authorities did not repent and ignored the Chinese police's authority. They falsely reported the matter to the police in the concession, acting perversely and disregarding the national system. The police arrested the workers, but since there was no crime to prosecute, they released them. The company, seeing that its plan had failed, published an urgent announcement in the newspaper, stating that the Shanghai main factory had announced a temporary shutdown since the Shanghai Incident, that workers who were unable to add their names had already been given severance pay, that the Japanese troops in the factory had not yet moved out, and that the houses and machinery were in disrepair and could not be started, etc., to cover up the truth from society. Sima Zhao's intentions are well known. All members of our union have served Sanyou for 20 years, but the company authorities do not know how to be grateful and instead recklessly destroy, placing thousands of workers in a desperate situation. The Sanyou Industrial Company, which has always been called upon in society to revitalize industry and reduce unemployment, should not have done this. If the company authorities have sufficient wealth and no intention of operating, they might as well announce it clearly. Why should they vacillate and make excuses? All members of our union are on the verge of starvation. If any unexpected disputes occur, the Sanyou Industrial Company should bear full responsibility. While we still have breath, we vow to fight to the end. We hope that people from all walks of life will give us righteous assistance. Industry is fortunate, society is fortunate. We hereby declare.</p>

Resolved: Notify members to prevent it at all times, and general meeting representatives should pay special attention and report union traitors as much as possible.

<p>The Shanghai branch of Tiger Balm Wing On Dispensary on North Sichuan Road has been established for several years. The owner of the dispensary, Mr. Hu Wenhu, a Chinese overseas in Singapore, was a strong supporter of the Shanghai War, having remitted 20,000 yuan to the Nineteenth Route Army and 10,000 yuan to Madam Liao Zhongkai, He Xiangning, for rescue efforts. The charitable donations collected and remitted by his own Singapore Daily News were also more than 300,000 yuan, which were given to the Nineteenth Route Army, the Shanghai Local Maintenance Committee, and the wounded soldiers' hospital run by Soong Ching-ling. The branch in Shanghai was forced to temporarily close due to the impact of the war. Now that the Shanghai war has ended, Mr. Hu believes that the branch should reopen as soon as possible. He has specially dispatched Mr. Hu Guigeng to Shanghai to serve as the general manager of the branch and plan the reopening. The former manager, Mr. Li, has also returned to Shanghai with Mr. Hu. It is said that Mr. Li will return to the Singapore headquarters after completing the handover at the branch. Mr. Hu Guigeng has always had a good reputation in the Chinese overseas community in Singapore and has also worked hard for social welfare and education. He also has a history in the newspaper industry, having served as the president of the Yangon Burma Morning Post, the president of the Singapore Star News, and was also one of the founders of the Singapore Daily News.</p>

<p>At a certain family home at No. 3 Xiaoshadu Road, West Shanghai, at midnight on the 27th of last month, someone suddenly knocked on the door. The owner was awakened by the pecking sound and asked who it was, only to be told that it was a postman delivering a letter. He immediately ordered the servants to open the door and accept it. Unexpectedly, a total of four people rushed in. Realizing that he had been tricked by thieves, one of the thieves held an object resembling a pistol and prohibited anyone from making a sound, while the remaining thieves were about to search and rob. The cook in the house seized the opportunity to go outside and shout for thieves. The thieves did not dare to rob anything and fled, and the deputy police chief of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, McCloud, chased them to Avenue Avénue Edward VII, intercepted one of the thieves, and snatched the object he was holding, only to find that it was a screw. Two more thieves were subsequently captured, and after investigation by the First Special District Court, Meng Shousong, Mu Tingfu, and Jin Ayou were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment by Judge Feng yesterday.</p>

Today, Mr. Zhang will still perform his lifetime masterpiece, the Frog Dance. Mr. Zhang has stopped performing this technique for seven years because it requires internal and external work and is very energy-consuming. This time, in order to repay the audience's enthusiasm, he will perform it again. Miss Mary, an American woman, will sing the entire Red Fiery Horse today. The programs of other actors are also very interesting. Tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival in the old calendar, and there will inevitably be a crowd.

<p>Angrily Reports to the Police Station</p>
<p>Yang Shepi and Others Detained</p>
<p>Zhu Shengzai, a 28-year-old Jiangxi native, has been running a palm mattress shop at 955 East-West Huade Road in the Public Concession. His wife, surnamed Wang, is an 18-year-old Cantonese woman with considerable beauty. On April 18th of this year, she suddenly went missing. Zhu searched everywhere, but to no avail. On the 24th, Yang Qiyuan (nickname "Shepi"), Ren Tianxing, Ren Yongxing, Ren Shunxiang, and others came, claiming, "We know your wife's whereabouts. If you want to see her again, you only need to give us 100 yuan as a gift, and we will forward it on your behalf." Zhu did not have this amount of money, but desperately missed his wife. He borrowed 10 yuan from his father, Lu Qifa, and handed it over to Yang Shepi at a small teahouse No. 53, Cangqiao Street, outside Xiaonanmen in the South City. Yang and the others then led Zhu to Zhang Yiben's place in Pudong. Zhang said to Zhu, "If you want your wife, that's easy. But you can't even scrape together a mere 'one-foot water head' (meaning 100 yuan). To be honest, people like us who 'eat the sun by day and drink the dew by night' don't have so much free time to deal with your petty affairs." Zhu had no choice but to return home and try to find a way, but he still couldn't raise the full amount. So, on the 4th of this month, he went to the South City again to plead with Yang, agreeing to pay the rest of the money after his wife was returned. Unexpectedly, Yang became furious upon hearing this, shouting loudly, "You are such an ungrateful person! We have been searching for your wife for you and have already spent a lot of money. Now, to be blunt, if you want your wife back, you must produce 140 silver dollars! Not even one copper coin less!" Zhu suspected that these people were intentionally extorting money. So, yesterday afternoon at about 4:00 PM, he reported the matter to the relevant section and precinct. The police were dispatched to the address, and Yang Shepi and the others were arrested. After being brought back, the precinct chief preliminarily questioned them and, considering the matter involved soliciting and extortion under false pretenses, and also suspected of abducting a married woman, ordered a written report to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Zhu Tugeng, a driver for the Paili Automobile Company, was driving car number 12660 at 12:25 PM on the 4th of this month, transporting passengers. While driving south on Avenue Saobao Sai in the French Concession, near Yufeng Lane, Chi Tongdeng, the six-year-old son of Chi Xuetang, the Shandong owner of the Hengtai Leather Shoe Store at number 132 on that road, was going out to buy something. He dashed out across the road from west to east. Zhu's car was unable to yield and struck Chi, injuring his head. The police recorded the license plate number and took the injured child, along with the car, to the police station, and then transferred him to the hospital. He died at 7:00 PM that night after treatment proved ineffective. The hospital notified the police station, who took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the vehicle affairs office summoned the family of the deceased, the defendant, and witnesses to the case, and reported it to the Second Special Court. Chen Beisan, the chief prosecutor, arrived at the scene and confirmed that the deceased had indeed died from a head injury caused by being struck by a car. He took his seat to formally hear the case, questioning the defendant and witnesses about the circumstances of the accident. He then ordered the body to be collected by the father of the deceased. The police station should investigate whether the defendant, Zhu Tugeng, was at fault and handle the matter according to the law.</p>

<p>Letters</p>
<p>To the editor, I recently read the solemn statement published in the news column of your newspaper on June 6th by the Postal Workers' Union, which stated that, according to reports, members Zhao Liancheng, Xing Rongzhao, Sun Hanliang, Tan Changde, and others violated public opinion and were instructed by a certain party to conspire to undermine the movement to consolidate the postal base. This is not in accordance with the facts. We are all members of the executive and supervisory committees of the union. We strongly support this postal workers' movement. However, the strike committee was manipulated by a minority of members of the union, and we, more than ten people who were obviously members of the action committee, were excluded. On June 3rd, at the general assembly, Zhu Xuefan and others reported and accused us of demanding a bribe of 30,000 yuan per person from the central government. The reporter, Yuan Shousheng, denied this. The details were published in your newspaper on June 6th as a warning. Such actions damage our personal reputation and dare to insult the central government. In addition to pursuing legal action, we request that your newspaper make a correction. We are sincerely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, Zhao Liancheng, Xing Rongzhao, Sun Hanliang, members of the executive committee, Tan Changde, member of the supervisory committee, Shanghai Postal Workers' Union. To the editor, yesterday your newspaper published a news item entitled "Results of Anti-Drug Speech Contest Announced." In it, the third-place winner, Liu Jiangang, of Huaqiao Middle School was mistakenly written as being from Zhonghua Middle School. We respectfully request that your newspaper correct this to conform to the facts. We are sincerely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the editor of the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, June 6th.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Sincerely Instruct Students and Maintain School Spirit <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to the heads of county education bureaus, stating that the incident in which the students of Xuzhou Middle School and Normal School went on strike and requested to be suspended as a whole because their request to visit other cities was not met has already been resolved by the department. All the causes and handling of the incident are understood. Although there are many reasons for the turmoil at the school, it must be recognized as a failure of moral education. Upon closer examination, it is related to the entire problem of school education. It cannot be solved by rectifying one school, nor can it be salvaged by punishing a few students, nor can it be fundamentally cleared by relying solely on severe measures. From the students' point of view, young people's blood is not yet settled, and they have not been deeply involved in the world. Their observation of things is easily confused by emotions. The occurrence of an incident inevitably involves many blind followers. By the time the situation has formed, those who handle it can only weigh the severity of the circumstances. How can they completely ignore the traces and return to the original intention? If they stumble one day, either their student status is removed, or their reputation is ruined, delaying their opportunity to study and losing their means of seeking knowledge is a small harm, but to cut off their ambition to learn and obliterate their conscience to repent, resulting in decadence and inaction for the rest of their lives, is a huge harm. Furthermore, they may be provoked to make a reckless decision. Once frustrated, they see themselves as no longer worthy of self-respect. Then, what cannot be done in terms of violating discipline and committing crimes? The impact is unimaginable. From the school's point of view, cultivating talent should create regular habits and a good environment to foster young people's self-governance and self-love. In terms of moral education on weekdays, it is necessary to influence them with sincerity and persuade them with reason. Once emotions are in harmony, reason will be easily guided. If, unfortunately, a conflict between teachers and students occurs, regardless of right or wrong, and regardless of how it is handled, discipline will be destroyed, and bad precedents will be created. The impact on the school's future is extremely significant. Even if it can be resolved quickly by following the law, the past wounds cannot be concealed, and subsequent remedies are even more difficult to achieve. Therefore, whether it is for the sake of the school, for the sake of the students, or even for the sake of the entire school education, in order to maintain school discipline, it is better to guide well at ordinary times than to punish after the event. To achieve students' academic success, it is better to prevent problems before they arise than to supervise after they have occurred. In the future, in addition to students following legal procedures to contribute reasonable opinions, the principals of each school should be open-minded, accept them, and implement them as appropriate. On weekdays, they must lead by example, work with all the teachers and staff to invigorate their spirits, and sincerely instruct them to ensure that all disputes are resolved invisibly, silently transformed, and integrated.</p>
<p>Reciprocally, so that the school does not damage its vitality, and the school spirit will gradually improve. If all efforts have been exhausted and the situation cannot be improved, and incidents still occur, the department will still adhere to the original policy and deal with them severely in order to treat both the symptoms and the root causes, and to be both lenient and strict. We will never be protective by condoning. This special order is for the bureau chiefs to forward to all concerned to comply with this order.</p>

It is only sending Shen Siliang, honorary director of the National Sports Association, to the United States as a member to attend the opening ceremony of the Games. Mr. Shen will depart for the United States on the 24th of this month. Other countries are actively preparing and selecting athletes. It is estimated that more than 50 member countries will participate.

<p>San Francisco, 5th. Stanford University athlete Payton Eastman recently set two new world running records. One is the 800-meter race, which Payton completed in 1 minute and 50 seconds (the old record was set by French athlete Martin in 1928 at 1 minute 50.6 seconds). The other is the 880-yard race, which Eastman completed in 1 minute 50.9 seconds (the old record was set by German athlete Berger at 1 minute 51.6 seconds).</p>
<p>Paris, 5th. France is actively preparing to participate in the World Games. Yesterday, a sports meet was held in advance at the Colombe Stadium. Discus thrower Noel threw 49.44 meters, breaking the French record of 48.80 meters held by Mr. Wen</p>

<p>We spent the night at Wu's mansion. Chun Sheng and I stayed in one room. Chun Sheng said: "Let's blow out the lights before we sleep. ...Phew, phew... Strange! Why can't I blow this light out? Zhonger! Get up and take a look." I blew a few times too, but the light didn't move. On closer inspection, it was exactly:</p>
<p>City ​​Lights,</p>
<p>Not a drop of oil.</p>
<p>Matches won’t light,</p>
<p>Big mouth cannot extinguish.</p>
<p>This lamp is wonderful. I really don't understand where the light comes from. That wire must be very important. Look, it is a double-stranded wire. There must be something wonderful about this strand. "Young Master Wu, why can't your light be blown out?" Young Master Wu laughed loudly in the living room and said: "You country bumpkin, this is an electric light, how can you blow it out? It's not difficult to make it turn dark. Look, it’s paired… isn’t it off? But on… interesting!” Chun Sheng also tried a few times. The more we tried, the more interesting it became, the more confused we became. Wu Dashao's half-baked explanation could not satisfy my desire for knowledge. I lay in bed and thought for a full hour and couldn't figure it out. In the end, I made a decision. Tomorrow I will hire a teacher. I can be content with his other qualifications, but if he can't tell me how the electric light emits light, I don't want to hire him. Yes, I must not forget to ask him why the people in those mirrors look so strange. If he can't explain this, he is not worthy to be the teacher of our ancient temple. Because if he can't answer these questions, what benefit will it bring to me, and what benefit will it bring to the children in our village? Haha, the teacher didn't test us, but we have to test the teacher first, how can this be! What other way do I have besides this?</p>

<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Makes Rapid Progress Young tennis player Zheng Zhaojia is a proud student of Lin Baohua. In last year's Shanghai French Chamber of Commerce Hard Court Championships, veteran players Wit and Turk were defeated by Zheng, a young hero admired by the Chinese people. In the final against Canadian Davis Cup player De Fo, Zheng was defeated by De Fo, but the progress of his skills was truly astonishing. According to Lin, Zheng practices with James Potter at the school (John's University) court every day, and Lin gives him various strategies and points out errors every day. His skills have improved even more. Veteran hero Jiang Daozhang will likely concede defeat. According to Lin, if Zheng Zhaojia can maintain his current humble and eager-to-learn attitude, next year today, I (Lin Baohua) and Qiu Feihai may not be his match. Diligence leads to expertise. Zheng is truly a promising young man.</p>
<p>De Fo and Others Are Still in Shanghai Canadian Davis Cup player De Fo won the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club's Open Singles and Hard Court Tennis Championships last year. In the semi-finals, he defeated Lin Baohua of China 3-1, and in the finals, he defeated Qiu Feihai, also by a score of 3-1. This man is still in Shanghai. Also, the Japanese player Hyosumi, who defeated Qiu Feihai last year, has not left Shanghai. These two are the big troubles for Lin and Qiu. However, this is enough to promote the vigilance and self-encouragement of our national players.</p>
<p>Lin Baohua Puts in Hard Work According to Lin himself, because De Fo and Hyosumi are in Shanghai, I must work hard to train from now on. I will never stop working hard, cut off social activities, study tennis, practice tennis, and pay attention to physical health to promote great fighting power, hoping to defeat De Fo and Hyosumi, restore the position of maritime leader, and intend to team up with Qiu Feihai to win the Robert Cup and Open Doubles championships. He hopes to go to the United States next year with Qiu Feihai and Zheng Zhaojia to represent China in the Davis Cup, to broaden their horizons and learn from each other, to promote China's interest in tennis and improve China's tennis level. The reporter believes that Lin's words show that he has not yet fulfilled his ambitions and deeply regrets it. Then, the people of the country should sincerely wish him well.</p>
<p>The United States Will Regain the Davis Cup The reporter also asked about the situation of this year's Davis Cup. Can the United States regain it from France? Lin replied that England will not do anything in this year's Davis Cup. The United States and France will meet again in George Town. The two American players, Vance and Hopkins, are very dangerous. The United States can definitely win the doubles, because Wenlein and Ellison are invincible in the world. Although France has the famous player Lacoste participating, Lacoste has retired for four years. Although he is making a comeback now, I am afraid he will not be able to restore his former glory. After this year's training, I know that he will definitely make great contributions to France next year. This year, Lacoste's participation in the Davis Cup may not be successful. As for Cochard, he has been prestigious for many years, but I am afraid he can only defeat the American Shields, but not Vance. Others, such as Borotra, are too old to fight for a long time. In short, the American Vance can win two singles, and Wenlein and Ellison win the doubles, then the United States will win the Davis Cup with a score of 3-2. However, the battle between the United States and France will take place in Paris. The French are accustomed to using Dunlop balls and hard courts, while the Americans are accustomed to using Tietelsen balls and grass courts. The elasticity of Dunlop balls is not as lively as that of Tietelsen balls, and balls on hard courts are difficult to catch. This is a major problem for the Americans. However, in order to regain the Davis Cup, the Americans are now instructing the Davis Cup players to gather in the western United States and practice on hard courts every day. If the United States regains the Davis Cup this year, it will be permanently displayed in the United States and will not be visited by other countries. This is due to the right time, the right place, and the right people. The reporter also deeply agrees with this statement. (The end)</p>

<p>The 10th World Olympic Games</p>
<h3 id="e186">Ambitions and Strength of Japanese Athletes (Part 2) Translated by Jiang Huaiqing <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Are the Japanese Willing to Lag Behind? This World Olympic Games will be attended by 35 countries, with approximately 2,000 athletes gathering at the Olympic Arena in Los Angeles. Athletes from all countries are the best in the world at the moment, each striving with all their might and ability, hoping to win the championship, break records, and raise their respective national emblems in the joyful and enthusiastic international arena, in order to promote their international status. How can Japanese athletes allow athletes from other countries to take all the glory and willingly lag behind?</p>
<p>Substantial Strength. The grand and enthusiastic cheers and the melodious music will be broadcast from Los Angeles on Sunday, July 31st, at the opening ceremony of the 10th World Games. In this great gathering of famous athletes from around the world, there will be the Finnish middle and long-distance runner Paavo Nurmi, the 100-meter champion of the 9th World Games Percy Williams, the American sprint star Wykoff, and other equally strong athletic heroes from various countries, such as the American 1500-meter general Vansk, the sprint world's Torrence, the middle-distance's Istomen, and many famous players from Finland, Germany, and Sweden. In the previous Games, Japan ranked fifth in the track and field event, and this time they will definitely increase their strength, hoping to achieve the best results, and plan to send many female track and field athletes to participate.</p>
<p>A Sure Thing. There are a total of 30 Japanese track and field athletes participating, with the strongest strength in sprints, long jump, pole vault, and marathon running, and there will definitely be great success. Other events such as middle-distance running, hurdles, discus, javelin, and shot put may also have good results, and it is not difficult to gain a place in the Games. They are currently intensifying training and encouraging improvement, and their results will definitely be more impressive than before. Nambu Chuhei, a graduate of Keio University, created a world record of 7.98 meters in the long jump at the celebration sports meet at the Meiji Jingu Stadium in November last year. This result is difficult for athletes from various countries in modern times to match. In this World Games, Nambu is sure to win the long jump and triple jump championships. Others, such as Oshima Kamakichi of Kansai University, also have quite good jumping results.</p>
<p>Oda's Comeback. Oda Mikio, who created a new world record in the triple jump at the previous Dutch Games, originally planned to retire, but recently his ambition has revived, and he has made a comeback to win glory for Japan. He is currently training, and his triple jump results can still reach 15.70 meters, and his long jump can also reach 7.70 meters. If so, the long jump and triple jump in this Games will be dominated by Japan.</p>
<p>Sprints and Long Distance. Yoshioka Ryutoku, the leader of the Japanese sprint world, holds the Japanese record of 10.5 seconds in the 100 meters, and broke the Olympic Games record of 21.3 seconds in the 200 meters. When the American sprint star Simpson visited Japan last year, Simpson's 100 meters was also overwhelmed by Yoshioka, but the result was 10.7 seconds. In short, Yoshioka has great hope in the sprints at the 10th World Games. The national champion in long distance is Tsuda Seiichiro, also a graduate of Keio University. He holds the highest authority in races above 1,500 meters. Although he is now employed by an insurance company, he still works hard to train and spares no effort. His time for 1,500 meters is 4 minutes 3 seconds, and for 10,000 meters it is 32 minutes 4 seconds.</p>
<p>Marathon Long Run. Tsuda Seiichiro is also a famous marathon long-distance runner, invincible in Japan, and always wins the championship in every race. In the 1928 Dutch World Games, Tsuda Seiichiro, as a teenager, also won sixth place. Kamata Hisanosuke is also a marathon running expert in Japan. In the previous World Games, he had great hope of winning the championship. He was always in the lead within 24 miles, but unexpectedly, with only two miles remaining, both feet were injured and he could hardly move. However, he still endured the pain and struggled to win fourth place, with a time of 2 hours 35 minutes 29 seconds. Both of these people have great hope in this Games. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Mei Hua</p>
<p>The first person to ask me to teach Latin was Liang Rengong. When Rengong asked me to teach him, he had already studied Latin for five months. Later, there were Cai Jimin, Zhang Jusheng, Wang Kangnian, and others. I was touched by the enthusiasm of these people for learning, and I thought of the general youth, so I decided to establish Aurora College.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of diligence in scholarship during the founding period of Aurora College was rare. At that time, the students not only had the ability to govern and motivate themselves, but also had a hundred times the courage to study, which was truly admirable! Sometimes I saw that they were working too hard, so I told them that they should rest, rest. Therefore, at that time, if students wanted to study, I would instead forbid them to study. At that time, oil lamps were still used at night. When I went to visit the students at night, everyone was reading under the lamp. When it was time to put out the fire, I personally went to put it out. After I left, they would light the fire again behind my back, which made it really impossible for me to deal with. Because they had such courage to study at that time, it was very strange that they could go on to read Latin anthologies after only five or six months of initial study. I once talked about this with foreigners, and they didn't believe it, thinking it was impossible. Later, Hu Dunfu went abroad to study in the United States. At that time, according to the American education system, one had to know Latin to enter university. Hu Dunfu said, "I have studied it in China." They didn't believe him, and took out a Latin anthology to test him on the spot. Coincidentally, the pages that were turned out were all what Hu Dunfu had studied at Aurora College. The test results showed that he could not only read but also explain, and then they were convinced.</p>

<p>— Han</p>
<p>My friend Xu Weinan told me that his friend Liu Dabai had died, "at a time when the country is in trouble and people are panic-stricken!"</p>
<p>Dabai once served as Deputy Minister of Education during Jiang Menglin's tenure as president. If he were a corrupt bureaucrat, his death would not be worth regretting. However, Dabai was a poet, a scholar, an educator, and one of the people I knew in my life who left a deep impression on me.</p>
<p>Six years ago, when I was the Director of General Affairs at Fudan University, Dabai and I lived in the South Dormitory. I lived in the southernmost room, and he lived in the northernmost room. He was in charge of academic affairs, and I was in charge of general affairs, so naturally we had few opportunities to talk. However, my impression of him was very deep. I heard that Dabai's funeral was poor, and the quilt in the coffin covered his head but not his feet. Before his death, he mentioned wanting to talk to a few friends about his funeral arrangements, but finally sighed and said, "My friends are all poor friends with pens, so there's no need to talk about the funeral!"</p>
<p>Weinan was Dabai's confidant. Since Dabai's death, the famous humorist Weinan has also become a "mourning family member." In order to commemorate Dabai and to help with the education of Dabai's children, he specially took out the letters Dabai wrote to him. There were a total of eighty letters, compiled into "Letters from a Cottage." "From these eighty letters, we can at least catch a glimpse of Dabai's personality, learning, life, hopes, and his illness."</p>
<p>I know Dabai to some extent, so I finished reading "Letters from a Cottage" in one breath. I think this little book is indeed worth recommending, especially to young friends, who should all read this book.</p>
<p>There are many wonderful things in "Letters from a Cottage." Let me excerpt a few passages to offer to the readers:</p>
<h3 id="e189">Han Palace Spring <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Lan</p>
<p>My family's Hai Shan Xian Hall. Located in Ban Tang Litchi. It is the old site of the Changhua Garden of the Southern Han Dynasty. The other residence of my paternal uncle, Duke Deyu of Fangbo. Waterside pavilion and wind corridor. Stretching for dozens of miles. There is a Bi Huang in the middle. It imitates the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon in West Lake. Seven ponds are opened to form it. My footprints have covered Wu and Yue. I have seen the Inner Garden Kunming Lake. The so-called famous gardens. I have not been able to compare. Now people and things have changed. Time has changed the scenery. Leaning on the boat and gazing. Only a hundred acres of fragrant pond remain. Lotus flowers send the evening. The picture painted by Xia Mingzhi and Tian Shiyou. Still in a friend's house. Sometimes I borrow it for browsing. You can still point out one or two of its grand aspects. In the summer of Xin Wei. Occasionally missing my hometown. I wrote this tune.</p>
<p>Scattered sacred mountains. Recognize the old site of Changhua. Bay of Dan Litchi. The green lotus of the desolate pond rises late. New formation in the summer. The moon is reflected in the Three Pools. Compared to West Lake. The tide is calm and the wind is gentle. All have been changed. Broken bridge and abandoned hall. All plans to clean up Fangzhou. Looking back at the sea and mulberry fields becoming illusions. Even the Qi Yun is tied with brocade. How many times have I come to visit. Old mansions in black clothes. Give way to the occasional seagulls. Golden titles and brocade brocade. There are people who embroider.</p>
<p>People have left their names in the books. I am old. Will Qing Ban be done? Returning home to reorganize the fishing boat.</p>
<p>"The three things that have influenced me most in my life are the eight-legged essay, mathematics, and Buddhist scriptures. Mathematics has cultivated a more logical mind in me, and Buddhist scriptures have cultivated my sense of sacrifice and courage. As for the eight-legged essay, it should have given me a bad influence... but I got from it a relatively meticulous exercise of my mind. What I also got from the Buddhist scriptures is the universal love of religion." From this fragment, we can see the foundation of Dabai's outlook on life.</p>
<p>Dabai didn't want to be an official but became an official, so he often complained to Weinan. The redder his official position became, the more intense his complaints became:</p>
<p>"This kind of life, which is based on circumstances, has been going on for almost ten months. There is no joy of music, but the labor of documents. You think how dry this is, but I am not afraid of this; what I am most afraid of is the siege of the rice bowl party."</p>
<p>"Now you should congratulate me. Old Liu's official luck is not higher than a hot air balloon but thinner than a hot air balloon, this hot air balloon has already burst!"</p>
<p>Dabai's advice to Weinan is worth its weight in gold and can serve as a guide for young people to live and conduct themselves in the world. Let me quote a passage from "Letters from a Cottage":</p>
<p>"People often say that you should have a long-term vision; it is true that you cannot do without a long-term vision. However, if your vision is too long-term, you will not see the practical problems in front of you.</p>
<p>"When people do things, they must be tempered by dealing with the smallest and most difficult practical problems."</p>
<p>There are really too many wonderful aphorisms in "Letters from a Cottage." I would still like to ask the readers to buy the original book and read it. (Note: This book is sold by Shanghai and other World Book Company branches, priced at three corners.) (Remuneration is donated to the Liu family's orphans)</p>
<h3 id="e190">A Record of the Exhibition of Cultural Relics of the Qi Yang Family (Part 1) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— K</p>
<p>The Exhibition of Cultural Relics of the Qi Yang Family, hosted by Zhu Qiqian (Gui Xin), was held at Zhongshan Park in Beiping from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM on May 23rd. Zhang Hanqing, Chen Renxian, Jiang Menglin, and other gentlemen and ladies, numbering over a hundred, visited one after another. After the flowers in the park had faded, it was a temporary success. The cultural relics were displayed in two rooms, totaling fifty-six items. Qu Guanying, Yuan Tongli, Qiu Meizhi, Liang Sicheng, and others assisted in organizing, collating, and displaying them. Starting from the 24th, it will be open to the public for two weeks. Among them, such items as the ink edict of Emperor Taizu of Ming and the Picture of the Li Clan Pacifying the Barbarians can all be used as factual evidence for the history of the Ming Dynasty, which is of great benefit to scholarship and is by no means superficial. Zhu told reporters that if people from the South are willing to study, they only need to provide a suitable display location, and he would be happy to promote culture.</p>
<p>The Beiping Society for Research in Chinese Architecture has compiled a special book on the examination of cultural relics of the Qi Yang family, which is difficult to transcribe one by one. Here are the main points:</p>
<p>Modern Chinese historical materials hidden in family histories are extremely abundant. However, after so many tribulations, there are not many that still have their brilliance. Only the Qi Yang family has maintained its continuity for more than 600 years.</p>
<h3 id="e191">On Frugality and Thrift to Save the Nation (4) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Narrated by Nie Zengjifen, Written by her Son Qi Jie</p>
<p>Its influence extends to the social economy. Everything is chosen from the West instead of the Chinese. China's old crafts are gradually being eliminated, and the number of unemployed and impoverished people has increased. Last year, the value of imported goods was a huge amount of 220 million yuan, with a deficit of 80 million yuan. This is the obvious effect of promoting European trends and developing desires in recent years. It's like a patient, further injured, bleeding non-stop. How can one expect them to live long? Today, people often say that this is the fault of capitalist aggression by imperialists. That's true. However, isn't Japan in the same position, equally subjected to capitalist aggression by European and American countries? Why is it that they can consolidate and strengthen themselves, and are so feared by the powers? The inconvenience of daily life and clothing is most evident in Japan. If Japan also competed in luxury, sought convenience, and sought comfort, then they would inevitably abandon what they already had and seek it externally. The huge amount of money spent would be unimaginable. Items such as Western-style bathtubs, toilets, stoves, wardrobes, iron beds, coil spring mattresses, tables, chairs, carpets, etc., are all considered indispensable by new Chinese figures. However, in that country, except for a very small number of noble families and wealthy merchants and public buildings, ordinary middle-class families generally do not have such things. Ordinary houses do not even have glass windows. The fact that the majority of their people can resolutely adhere to their old customs and be content with inconvenience and discomfort is because they can restrain their private desires in order to preserve the spirit and material resources of the nation. This cannot be achieved without the power of education, and the reason why their educators were able to have this foresight decades ago is because the reformers at that time were deeply indebted to Chinese scholarship (mostly Yangming scholars). They were able to see far and wide, knowing that preserving the national essence is the way to strengthen the nation's power, so they were not invaded by Western culture. Rituals and frugality are the beautiful essence of Chinese culture. Rituals are based on self-restraint and desire control. Less desire leads to order and frugality. This is what people today criticize as passive morality and cannibalistic rituals, so they do the opposite and say, "Developing desires can promote culture." Alas, what do the facts prove? Throughout history, all those who have been able to benefit their people and benefit their country, as evidenced by historical records, are rich in this passive morality.</p>
<p>Replacing it is a historical trace. The Qi Yang family is Li Wenzhong, the nephew of Emperor Taizu of Ming, who followed Emperor Taizu to rise up in the army, establish meritorious service, and establish the country. Wenzhong's son, Jinglong, participated in the Jingnan Campaign. Later, he was convicted and imprisoned. He was pardoned and re-enfeoffed during the Hongzhi reign. During the Wanli reign, his descendant, Zongcheng, served as the Japanese envoy. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, his descendants joined the banner system and settled in Beidu. They continued to be prominent in literature and officialdom until today. Although they have been reduced to commoners in the former capital, they still carefully adhere to their old possessions. Among this collection of old possessions, there is the ink edict given by Emperor Mingzu, clothing worn by him, portraits of emperors of past generations, and illustrated books of meritorious deeds. The historical materials are precious and can be considered first-class.</p>
<h3 id="e192">A Brief Record of Visiting a Refugee Factory <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>The Japanese army bombed Shanghai, wantonly slaughtering innocent civilians in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Taicang, and Changshu. Shops, factories, markets, and houses were all destroyed! The cries of the wounded were everywhere, people were displaced, and the number of homeless people totaled more than 100,000. Who is to blame? Who caused this? It is truly heart-wrenching!</p>
<p>Comrades from the People's Livelihood Improvement Society, Huang Jingxiang, Pan Yangyao, Ying Shugui, Li Denghui, and others formed a subcommittee to discuss the issue of refugees' livelihoods. Chaired by Huang, they established the "January 28th Refugee Factory." Funding was temporarily provided by the Chinese Christian Church and several national entities and private individuals. The factory site is located on Luo Beigen Road in Beixinjing. I visited yesterday and made the following notes:</p>
<p>The factory initially accommodated more than 90 refugees, and more are being admitted. All have work. The elderly and weak are assigned to watch the gate, help raise children, and twist ropes, while the young and strong are learning a skill, each with a master to teach them. Children of school age are sent to school. Refugee workers also have night school classes in the evenings, all managed by Ms. Bai Zhian. Refugees live naturally. Mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, fathers and sons, and brothers who have family organizations can still live together, while widowers and single women are separated. The factory is temporarily divided into (A) Sock Factory, (B) Rattan Factory, (C) Wood Factory, (D) Tailoring, and (E) Straw Factory. In addition, it is planned to add "Weaving," "Leather," and "Glass" departments. According to Huang, "Refugees are not easy to train. Disputes often occur. They are greedy, lazy, and unwilling to work. Sincere guidance is needed."</p>
<p>After refugees enter the factory, they are trained in a craft by a master according to their personality and interests, implementing the principle of "working to eat." The factory plans to rename itself "Cooperative Factory" in the future. Its purpose is to help suffering compatriots, not to be compared with capitalist-invested factories. The surplus of labor is still consumed by the laborers. The future development of the factory will be the center of the Beixinjing district. Huang hopes to deeply involve the people and engage in rural reconstruction movements.</p>

<p>— Owner of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 9: With a Special Train, Chasing Away Guests with False Alarms; Sitting in a Cold Government Office, Turning into Stone with Longing. Mao Deshun quietly pushed An Yutian from behind. An Yutian also immediately understood that this seat could not tolerate his presumptuous occupation for long. He got up to say goodbye, vacating the good position near the water pavilion, allowing those with sufficient status to accompany the commander-in-chief. However, he was already very satisfied. He retreated to the fifth wife's compartment, where he was asked by Liang Xiaoyun and briefly reported some of the satisfying experiences. He thanked the fifth wife again for her thoughtful care. Liang Xiaoyun was delighted. He also sat heavily, carefully organizing and recalling the various impressions he had just gained. Among these, what he found most peculiar was that Ye Zuozhang was not as crude as he had imagined, nor as bad as the public opinion attacked him to be. A crude person could not have said so many reasonable things. An evil person, in particular, would not have been so eager to use talent. It can be seen that a military man being able to reach such a high position as a military governor was by no means entirely due to luck. He must have had his own strengths. One does not know until one has experienced it. Hearing is not as good as seeing. He had been holding on to the views of a scholar, dismissing such warlords in general, which was a mistake. However, the mistakes were increasing, and he had been bewitched by the warlords, poisoned by the warlords, and was truly about to surrender willingly, beyond help. Thinking randomly in this way, he vaguely passed by this good show, seeing without seeing and hearing without hearing. The couple then personally sent the fifth wife back to the residence, where the fifth wife invited them to come in and talk for a while. They talked about inviting them both to take the special train to Beijing. Before leaving, they could come here to board the train together, and she would send someone to take care of everything. Liang Xiaoyun thought that since her husband was going out to work for the first time, she, as his virtuous assistant, had to assist him in every way. If she was often with the fifth wife, she could also hold on to this powerful internal connection. She immediately agreed with joy. After leaving the Ye residence and returning home, the couple again discussed finishing up matters at the Beijing residence. Many bulky chests and wooden furniture were inconvenient to carry because this time they were riding on someone else's special train. Also, the matter had not been fully settled, so they could not rashly move the whole family. They had to temporarily leave it in Beijing. The chests were locked and sealed, and all the wooden furniture and sundries were locked in the various rooms, leaving the tenant Chang Sheng and the nanny A Jin to guard them. The couple only brought some clothes to change, packed in two or three small, convenient leather bags. They took along the servant Wang Ding and a young maid, A Qiao. They also withdrew a sum of money from the bank and opened a draft, specifically for this trip's expenses.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Steady State of Gold Market <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuations Around Eight Taels: Yesterday, the gold market initially declined but quickly rebounded, maintaining a generally stable state. The total fluctuation for the day was around eight taels. Ultimately, it rose by more than two taels. With the silver market reporting an increase, trading was expected to open lower. However, buying interest persisted, and short positions were covered. Furthermore, a certain bank was reportedly shipping spot goods for export, boosting market sentiment and leading to a resurgence in higher prices. Nevertheless, the foreign exchange market did not show any tension, causing a slight downward movement, with fluctuations of two to three taels at times. The overall market remained lackluster, hovering around 718 taels. The following is a detailed account of the day's trading:</p>
<p>Silver Prices Open Lower in the Morning: Trading opened in the morning at 712.5 taels for the July contract, down 3.2 mace. This was due to the previous day's large silver bars increasing by another 1/16, with the silver price rising by 1/4. Following this, Yi Yu and others bought in from 12 to 13.5 taels, while goods and retail investors sold, immediately dropping by more than one tael to 11.8 mace. The exchange rate seemed stable. The U.S. dollar buying price at the bank for September was 31.8125 yuan. Soon after, Fu Yu, Heng Yu, Zhi Feng, Yong Heng, Xing Long, Sheng Yuan, Chun and others competed to buy, coupled with the outflow of cash from a certain bank, with the September British gold rate being around 1875, both in and out, causing the gold price to suddenly rise by more than seven taels to 19 taels. As sellers made slight moves, the price fell back to 16.3 mace. When the British gold rate was announced, it was 17.5 taels, and the posted price remained unchanged. Later, Yuan Mao, Yong Nei, Xing Da Lian, Bang Yuan, Tai and others sold. HSBC also offered near-term British gold at 180625, with September in and out both at 1875. Therefore, at 10 o'clock, the price was 16 taels. Afterwards, Fu Yu, Zhi Feng, Yong Heng, Yu Hong, Kang Yong, Zhao Feng, Chang and others bought, and because the bank had received September U.S. dollars at 625, the price immediately rose by one or two taels. There were also rumors that a certain bank wanted to import cash, offering a price of 17 taels, but no agreement was reached. However, the market price continued to rise by more than one tael, reaching 19.6 mace at around 50 minutes. Later, because HSBC offered next month's British gold at 18125, and also offered October U.S. dollars at 8125, Bing Xing and others also offered, immediately dropping by three taels to 16.6 mace at 11:00. Wan Xing, Heng Yu, Hong Kang Yong and others came in to buy, pulling it up by more than two taels. After 11:30, it was 18.9 mace, and Shanghai and Mai Hang were mutually trading near-term British gold at 0625. Hua Bank absorbed September U.S. dollars at 6875, and then retail investors sold, dropping by 2.0 mace to 16.7 mace at noon. By the close, it was 17.4 mace, with the announced price still calculated at 790 taels, estimated at 734 taels.</p>
<p>Lackluster Afternoon Market: The afternoon market opened at 16.7 mace, then rose by more than one tael, as Da De Cheng, Hong Kang Yong, Huo Yu, Zhi Feng Yong and others all entered. Also, various banks were trading September U.S. dollars at 31.615 yuan. At 2:30, it was 18.4 mace. Then goods were sold for hedging, and with July British gold against 125 and September at 1875, it slightly moved more than one tael. From 2:30 to 3:30, there were only slight fluctuations. Then it was 17 taels. Later, because Hong Kang Yong and Yi Feng and others bought, and with near-term U.S. dollars trading at 9375, the price rose sharply, reaching 18.8 mace at 4:20. However, most retail long positions took this opportunity to sell to balance their accounts, unwilling to hold overnight, so the price suddenly fell by one tael to 7.8 mace. By the 4:30 close, it was 18 taels, an increase of 2.3 mace compared to last Saturday. After the close, trading was again done at below 18 taels. According to the full day, the maximum was 19.6 mace, the minimum was 11.8 mace, with a difference of 7.8 mace. The announced price was calculated at 723 taels. The recorded price was 17 taels. The supplementary water was 17 taels. The afternoon was 18 taels. The net addition was 10.75 mace.</p>
<p>Uneven Activity Among Traders: According to the surface transaction statistics, Fu Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, Heng Yu, Fu Tai Heng, Hong Kang Yong, Yuan Da Yong, Heng Xing, Wan Xing, Da De Cheng, and Yuan Chun all bought in. Yuan Mao Yong sold more than bought. Yuan Tai and Tong Chun sold. Speculator Mr. Wu held short positions. In the afternoon, Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Yu, Shun Li, Da De Cheng, and Hong Kang Yong all bought in. Wan Xing and Yi Feng Yong all sold. Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Tai, Heng Chang Yong, Yu He and others had mixed transactions. Da Lian helped buy a total of four to five hundred bars and sold a total of two hundred bars. Guang Bang slightly bought two to three hundred bars.</p>

<p>Stable Foreign Exchange Market</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the beginning of the week, the silver market had no telegrams, but the day before had reported an increase. Exchange rates were stable. As for HSBC's posted prices, except for Indian exchange being reduced by 25 and German exchange being increased by 25, the rest remained unchanged. The initial bank transaction prices showed a slight discount. Soon after, the gold market turned upward, and the foreign exchange market also became stable. The afternoon showed signs of holding steady. The result was not much different from last Saturday. However, the gold price rose by more than two taels, showing a slight upward trend, due to the particular shortage of cash, which pushed up futures prices. Trade among Chinese merchants was ordinary. The total amount of British gold was about 100,000 pounds, mostly traded among banks. HSBC was selling positions, and Hua Bank was absorbing some. The total amount of British gold was about 450,000 yuan. Gold traders were selling in the morning market and watching in the afternoon market. Only Sino-American and other banks were doing some mutual trading. The mood was generally stable.</p>

Early in the day, it was heard that the basic price for near-term was 1 shilling 8 pence 0625, and for far-term, it was 1875. The buying price was 125 to 25.

<p>Rare Settlement Transactions</p>
<p>Market Overview: Currently, foreign interest rates remain sluggish with limited price increases, and there is no hope for silver interest rates to improve. The overall market condition lacks vitality, and the general business of the silver and money industry lacks the ability to develop. As a result, the current state is sluggish, and people are lax. There is no new information worth recording.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Arbitrage Prices: The "foreign interest rate" early market was weak by 1.25 hao to 6 qian 9 fen 6 li 3 hao 7 hu 5 si.

The afternoon market slightly recovered by 625 to 5 qian 9 fen 4 li 3 hao 7 hu 5 si. Transactions were 115,000 jiao in the morning market and 60,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained unchanged at 423,500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Coin Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" Yesterday, although it was Monday, the bank settlement was sparse. Chinese merchants' settlement notes totaled 2.23 million, foreign merchants' settlement notes totaled 2.45 million, various goods, exchange rates, taxes, and other settlement notes totaled 8.45 million, warehouse outflow was 700,000, money shops and silver public settlement notes totaled over 20 million, waterhead funds settlement notes totaled over 3.5 million, various exchange funds settlement notes totaled over 700,000, cash collection was 4-500,000, and note arbitrage transactions totaled over 3 million.

<h3 id="e198">Money Shops Closed for Traditional Holiday <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Tomorrow (June 8th) is the Dragon Boat Festival, a traditional holiday, also known as the Summer Solstice. Money shops will be closed for one day as usual. All settlements will be handled on the following day (the 9th).</p>
<h3 id="e199">Securities and Bond Prices Fall by Around One Yuan <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Trading Volume Reaches Approximately 5.5 Million Yuan Yesterday, the market conditions for various securities at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were as follows: Spot transactions were scarce, with only 34,000 yuan traded throughout the day, of which the 20 Customs bonds accounted for over 22,000 yuan. Futures trading, however, far surpassed the previous day, with significant price drops on the market, leading to a sudden increase in market activity. Total morning transactions reached over 3.3 million yuan, with another 2.1 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling 5.48 million yuan. Among these, the Supervisory Tax accounted for 1.185 million yuan, the Consolidated Tax accounted for 900,000 yuan, the 20 Customs bonds and troop disbandment bonds each accounted for over 700,000 yuan, and other bonds accounted for 3-400,000 yuan. The 96 Customs bonds still had the May contract, with only the Feng Tax opening at 15,000 yuan. The changes were primarily due to rumors of the Minister of Finance's resignation, creating a sense of weakness, leading to increased selling pressure and significant price declines. However, as each price dropped sharply in the early morning, and investment interest remained strong, the supply and demand situation did not change significantly, so the price fluctuated without large increases or decreases. As a result, prices fell by 6-7 jiao to around 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. In general, the market situation for bonds was still relatively good.</p>

<p>(Report from the U.S. Eastern Banking Corporation)</p>
<p>Recently, in the New York market, the cooperative maintenance of bond prices by the banking sector has influenced the overall situation. Prices of various commodities have generally increased, and stock prices have also uniformly risen. The securities market on Saturday remained very active, with half-day transaction volume reaching one million shares. Industrial stocks rose by 2.48 pounds, and railway and public utility stocks also made significant progress. Speculative trading in the market seemed very active, and short positions were still being covered. Since the Senate's investigation and crackdown, there have been fewer shorts, so only the market continues to rise, and shorts will have even fewer opportunities to manipulate. Currently, the mood continues to improve, as can be seen from the rise in commodity prices. According to the usual market rules, there may be a correction within the day. If speculators are present, they will likely sell off if there is even a small profit to be made. But in general, even if there is a pullback within the day, it will quickly recover. The Dow Jones index for Saturday is as follows:</p>
<p>June 3rd June 4th Rise/Fall</p>
<p>30 Industrials 48.40 50.88 Up 2.48</p>
<p>20 Railroads 15.80 17. Up 1.77</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<h3 id="e201">Yarn Market Experiencing Heavy Selling Pressure <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yarn Exchange Closed for Summer Solstice on the 8th</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is very weak and trending downward. Although the major settlement period has passed, financial conditions in various regions remain tight, leading to a weak sentiment. Most people expect the market to decline after the current sales stop due to low raw material prices. Therefore, there are many sellers. However, sporadic transactions in the southern ports have not stopped. Other regions are showing even less activity. Apart from a certain country's yarn price improving by 2 yuan, the price of benchmark yarn has increased slightly.</p>
<p>Benchmark Price Falls by 8-9 Qian: The benchmark yarn market opened</p>
<p>with rising sentiment due to the increase in American cotton. Near-term months rose by 5, 6, and 7 qian, while far-term months rose by 1-2 qian. The second and third rounds showed a reversal, with each month ultimately falling by 3-4 qian. In the afternoon, sales pressure increased due to the worsening situation in Guangdong and Chaozhou, with each month falling by 5-7 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 16,000 bales. The statistics show that Sui Long sold 450 bales, Tong Yu 300 bales, Rong Xing 1,050 bales, Rui Da 300 bales, Chang Feng 400 bales, Yi Yu 800 bales, and Tai Chang 450 bales. Yi Chang bought 1,050 bales, Yu Shen 600 bales, Da Chang 600 bales, Yi Da 600 bales, Da Chang Cheng 450 bales, and Tian Long 400 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Benchmark Closing, Rise/Fall, Inventory Number October 1518 Down 8 33,300 July 1519 Down 7 16,750 November 1518 6 24,450 August 1518 8 26,850 Total 127,300 September 1518 9 27,950</p>
<p>Yarn Sales at 800 Bales: Current yarn sales are relatively flat. Statistics show that various regions bought a total of 800 bales throughout the day. 20 bales were purchased by other traders, and the market price fell by 2.5 qian. Among the customer regions, Guangdong purchased 415 bales, Changsha 20 bales, Wuhu 5 bales, Shantou 129 bales, inland 55 bales, Hankou 10 bales, Jiangxi 70 bales, Sichuan 65 bales, Xuzhou 10 bales, and Ningbo 10 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e202">No Prospects for Recovery in Cotton Market <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market remains flat, but American cotton has rebounded by 20 points. The local cotton market has failed to follow the increase because the local cotton base price is too high, and spot traders continue to hedge sales. Market sentiment is weak, making it difficult for the market to recover. However, if American cotton continues to rise, the benchmark price may also show some rebound. But based on the overall trend, there is no significant hope. Only the Ningbo traders remain reluctant to let go.</p>
<p>Zheng Benchmark Ordinary: The Zheng benchmark market opened, following the increase in American cotton by 1 qian. However, far-term prices remained flat. Market sentiment remained weak in the afternoon, with large traders selling off, causing prices to fall by 5 fen to 2 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 30,700 dan. Statistics show that Sui Long sold 6,800 dan, Heng Yi 800 dan, Yi Yu 1,600 dan, Xin Cheng 400 dan, and Sheng Tai 400 dan. Zhen Da bought 1,200 dan, Tong Fu 800 dan, Tian Long 800 dan, Yi Chang 1,500 dan, Chang Feng 2,000 dan, Yi Feng 1,200 dan, and Yong Da 1,100 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Benchmark Closing, Rise/Fall, Inventory Number October 339 Down 1 087,800 July 3080 Up 5 47,700 November 3155 Up 5 63,300 August 3100 Down 1 075,200 Total 276000</p>
<p>Factory Demand Dull: The factory demand for current cotton remains dull. The source is estimated to be 840 bales of Yao cotton and 150 bales of Tong cotton. The sales record shows that Dong Gou cotton was sold for 29.50, and Yong Yu purchased 1,000 bales of spot goods for delivery to the factory.</p>

<p>The American economic panic is deepening. Wholesale prices have fallen to the low levels of 1899. Commodity prices remain weak, railway revenues are insufficient, bond and stock prices are falling daily, and agricultural products are remarkably cheap, with prices barely covering planting costs. Farmland is not being bought, and the number of unemployed is in the millions, including hundreds of thousands in abject poverty.</p>

<p>Mumbai: Futures trading only occurred on one day last week. There were a large number of transactions in the Far East, mostly sold by transporters. After the price fell, short positions were slightly covered. White Luo Creek cotton was reported to be loaded for export, but inquiries were concentrated on Piral cotton, Gandhi false cotton, and Pingguo cotton. In the spot market, local factories bought some to meet urgent needs. The attached is the weekly statistics (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Liverpool: The spot demand was quiet last week. The futures market was extremely depressed due to the small decline in American cotton and the failure of two Liverpool agents. The market briefly rebounded at the weekend due to the announcement of the U.S. budget. However, the trend remained bleak due to weak U.S. business conditions and good weather. Egyptian cotton was entirely suppressed by the foreign market. However, Alexandria bought a lot at low prices.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3 id="e205">Haiment New Cocoon Harvest Also Poor <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Purely Damaged by Weather... Total Harvest Less Than 30%</p>
<p>The farmers in the coastal sandbanks of Haimen who raised spring silkworms this year only accounted for 50% of last year. There were different types of silkworm eggs, and few stable foreign varieties were hatched. Most used self-retained local varieties for hatching. Due to unfavorable weather, the extent of damage to silkworm larvae reached 60%. The loss of silkworm production was less than 30% of the total harvest. Farmers suffered unrecoverable losses on their silkworm investment. The new cocoons have already been launched on the market. Only three or four silk merchants have opened for business. The initial price for local cocoons was only 15-16 yuan. Improved cocoons rose to 20 yuan. Most of the local cocoons are of inferior quality with thin shells, and silk merchants are refusing to weigh and collect them.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Both Arrivals and Sales of Red and Green Tea are Strong <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, over 8,300 boxes of silk and tea from Tunxi, Shexian, and other routes, and black tea from Qimen and Fuliang routes, arrived in Shanghai. Among tea transactions, Qimen tea was still the most popular, but there were many second and third batches of goods with inferior quality, selling for 80-90 taels, unchanged from last week. Merchants such as Yingzhuang, Jinlong, Yihua, and Tianyu from Tunxi and Shexian all had a good appetite for Zhenmei tea. The market was especially active for Zhenmei tea. Top-grade goods from Tunxi opened as high as 80 taels, and sales were extremely strong. The sales of Pingshui pearl tea to the U.S. have also become active. However, due to telegrams from New York indicating low prices, Chinese tea merchants are mostly unwilling to compromise and sell off their stock due to cost considerations.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Wuyuan Tea Merchants Stop Making Top-Grade Sprout Tea <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>After searching for new tea leaves for the past ten days, tea merchants in Wuyuan have sold 60-70% of their inventory in the market. As a result, the asking price in recent days has only dropped by 3-4 yuan compared to before. Mountain households are not worried about unsold inventory due to the limited stock, and the mood is very stable. In view of the recent sluggish Shanghai market and the fact that sales prices are not as good as in previous years, tea merchants mostly intend to temporarily purchase one batch and then observe the market trend before deciding whether to add more stock. The past two days, Yi Zhuang has repeatedly received telegrams from Shanghai stating that the opening price for Tunzhen is 155, but there were no further negotiations, and the merchants stopped making bud core tea, etc. Upon receiving this news, the tea merchants became even more cautious and reduced costs in line with market trends. They all made less bud core tea and switched to making regular Zhenmei tea to avoid heavy losses. The top-grade bud core vanilla and Longteng Wanli Donglu goods from Jinzhu Jitai Tea House are all being shipped from Hangzhou to Shanghai and are expected to arrive in Shanghai around the beginning of the month to show samples.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Fuliang Green Tea Prices and Sales Fall Slightly <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Ten days ago, merchants from the Xiuning and Wuyuan regions flocked to buy Fuliang's southeastern green tea, and mountain households took advantage of the situation to raise prices. Market prices once rose to over 60 yuan. About 50% of the tea in the mountains has been sold. Now, due to the sluggish Shanghai market, the merchants from Xiuning and Wuyuan are abandoning the purchase of tea with inferior water leaves compared to their own tea gardens. Even if there is a need, the prices must be reduced by 30 yuan. As a result, general merchants who wanted to wait for higher prices are unable to sell their unsold inventory and are very anxious. Therefore, the market price for Fuliang tea has not only fallen but also there are very few inquiries.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Rice Market Arrivals and Sales are Balanced <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, the source of rice in the market from the western route was 13-14 numbers. The transaction on this street was even more flat. The number of purchases by Changshu, Xixing, and Beishi, as well as Sutong merchants, was several hundred dan. The price followed the original market. Although the sales of thin rice was ordinary, the inventory was not large. The market was in a state of cultivation. The arrivals and sales of Lu Yangjian were balanced, and there was no change in the market.</p>
<p>Shanghai North: Yesterday, the source from the interior was 25-26 numbers. The transaction between urban and rural areas was balanced as the weather cleared. The market sentiment for thick japonica suddenly softened slightly. However, the blockage period for foreign rice has arrived, and there was no change in thin early rice. The amount of He Xia Hu feet in the two markets was about 3,500 stones.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Tianjin Merchants Trial Small Ground Rice <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Both arrivals and inventory are high, and the price has fallen by a small jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market condition for foreign rice continued to weaken because foreign firms still had surplus for sale, and there were over one million bags of rice in inventory. Recently, orders continued to arrive, and the quantity was also very large. Therefore, the market sentiment was very weak, and the desire of cargo owners to sell became more eager. The market price continued to fall by another jiao. Although the sales volume was active, there was no large-scale movement. However, yesterday, Tianjin merchants tested the market by loading 500 bags of small ground rice. If it can be successfully distributed in the future, there may be continued loading. The local streets and villages in the interior all had responses. The market opened with 2,500 bags of small ground rice, priced at 10 yuan 07.5 to 45 jiao. 500 bags of Saigon No. 1 were priced at 11 yuan 6.2 to 5.5 jiao. 1,300 bags of red rice were priced at 9 yuan 7.5 jiao. 200 bags of Calade coarse rice were priced at 9 yuan 8.5 jiao.</p>

<p>More Goods Out Than In</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, all months showed a downward trend. The quoted price for foreign wheat, American wheat was lower by 3-4 jiao, and Canadian wheat was lower by 1.3-4 yuan. In addition, sales were weak and inventory was abundant, causing extreme congestion. There were more goods going out than coming in. Therefore, the opening price was already lower by 2 fen compared to the previous day, and then continued to decline. By the time the afternoon market opened, it once again showed a sharp plunge. This was due to rumors that foreign merchants were selling far-term foreign wheat again. No. 2 American wheat was equivalent to about 4 taels 2 qian per Shanghai yuan, and Canadian wheat was equivalent to 4 taels 1 qian 3 fen. The standard new wheat also opened as scheduled. Due to economic reasons, most people were pessimistic, and the factory inventory was about 3 million bags. Therefore, although the sales volume was not very large, the market plummeted. The closing price for July was compared to the initial change of the previous day, with a sharp decrease of one qian. Compared to the closing price, July and August fell by 6 fen 7 li 5 hao, September and October fell by 7 fen 5 hao, and November fell by 7 fen 7 li 5 hao. The total transaction volume for the city was 415,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Yesterday's Futures Wheat Trading Opened <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Prices Stepped Downwards</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the first day of resumed futures wheat trading. After the morning opening, due to reports of lower prices for foreign wheat and new wheat entering the market, everyone believed that this year's harvest would be very abundant. However, due to financial constraints, domestic merchants generally lacked the capital to stockpile. Consequently, market sentiment was unstable. The opening prices were: July at 3 taels, 5 mace, and 7 fen; August at 6 mace and 2 fen; September at 6 mace and 9 fen; October at 7 mace and 5 fen; and November at 8 mace and 1 fen. Later, buying orders were stronger, leading to slight increases of one or two fen. By the afternoon opening, due to the sluggish flour market and rumors of foreign wheat being sold off, market sentiment became uniformly depressed. Opening prices for all months gradually declined. The closing prices showed a sharp drop compared to the opening prices: July down 8 fen, August down 7 fen, September down 5 fen, October down 4 fen, and November down 5 fen. New wheat samples have already arrived in Shanghai and are of good quality. However, in various parts of Jiangnan, excessive rainfall will cause significant variations in yields between high and low-lying fields.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Purple Copper Spot Trading Desolate <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Purple copper trading has recently become desolate again. This is because the guilds are stopping purchases in anticipation of the upcoming festival, and factories are not adding to their stocks either. As a result, transactions are extremely quiet, and standard prices are declining. For example, TC brand is quoted at 38 taels, T brand at 39 taels, and C brand at 37 taels. It is said that only 400-500 dan were offered.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Refined Antimony Rose Five Taels Yesterday <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, foreign firms have been inquiring about refined antimony, so market sentiment has been good. Prices have increased by 5 taels per ton, estimated at 205 taels per ton. It is said that 20-30 tons were sent to Tianjin and other northern ports yesterday. If foreign firms take action after the festival, there is hope for future market development.</p>
<p>Provisions</p>
<h3 id="e215">Candied Dates Market Deteriorating <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Since the price drop, there has been no chance of recovery. This is mainly because there are still large inventories, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Therefore, market prices are deteriorating. Recently, some Guangdong merchants have been purchasing, but in small quantities, which is difficult to improve the situation. Other wholesale transactions are based on a principle of not advancing unless prices are low, otherwise, sales are difficult. Consequently, the ordinary price for bald dates is no more than 13 taels, with surcharges added according to customary practice. The market is sluggish.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3 id="e216">Sichuan Merchants Active in Woolen Cloth Trading <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>As the weather turns hot, woolen cloth trading is declining as usual. Apart from some local merchants adding to their stocks, Sichuan merchants stationed in Shanghai are not doing much business. However, there are signs of activity from Sichuan merchants. Major and minor merchants such as Dachuan Tong, Taikoo Yu, Jardine Yu, Yiji, Huiji Xin, and Xieji Xin all intend to trade. In fact, orders for 40-50 boxes have already been placed, mostly for plaid and water tweed, along with blue-gray plain serge and Zhigong tweed. They are currently awaiting shipment and customs clearance. It is rumored that negotiations are underway for dozens more boxes.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3 id="e217">Asphalt Sales Weak in Summer <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Decreasing Number of Candle and Soap Factories</p>
<p>Asphalt sales have already decreased. Fortunately, soap factory transactions prevent the market from becoming completely desolate. However, compared to previous years, sales are less than half. The decline in various businesses is apparent. Overall, the war's impact makes recovery difficult in the short term. Although Hankou is a central location for production and sales, it also sees both sales and outflow, which is fortunate because inventory is not heavy, and prices are already low, so they are not likely to depreciate too much. The situation is still sustainable. Recently, Hankou prices are still around 16 taels plus a little for each item, and Macheng oil is 15 taels, 5 mace, and 6 fen. Uniquely, the market in Zhejiang is improving daily. It is said that Hangzhou merchants must pay 29 yuan for Neiping asphalt delivered to Shanghai, an increase of one yuan compared to the lowest price. Most likely, production area inventories have been depleted, and supply sources have been cut off. Hangzhou merchants also have no base goods. Retail sales have not completely disappeared, so scarcity makes goods expensive. Shanghai merchants do not stock up much because summer tasks have been completed, and soap factory sales are only small numbers. Also, factory prices are only 18 or 19 taels, so profits are difficult to obtain, and customer goods have not arrived for a long time. Merchants can only sell the stock on hand.</p>

<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Newspapers advocating and opposing the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union are engaged in a fierce war of words, exchanging blows and kicks. However, Japan, without making a sound, has already been secretly negotiating with Soviet Russia and is close to success.</p>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, Japan is not rushing on the Northeast issue, not because it fears the investigation team, but to divide the spoils with Russia. It is also rumored that Japan will temporarily stay out of the limelight and have the puppet government of the Northeast first enter into a restoration of diplomatic relations with Russia, including the exchange of envoys and consuls. Europe and the United States are paying close attention to this matter. If this news is confirmed, then both those advocating and opposing the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union are making much ado about nothing.</p>
<p>Today, let me tell a joke. Two people, A and B, both nearsighted, are competing with each other and cannot resolve their dispute. C says, "Tomorrow, a new plaque will be hung in a certain temple, and you can test your eyesight." A and B are both cunning. A first goes to eavesdrop on the four large characters on the plaque. B is even more cunning and inquires about the inscription above and below.</p>
<p>The next day, the two go together. A points to the plaque in the hall and says, "The four characters are such and such." B says, "The large characters are easy to recognize. I can also identify the inscription." The two start arguing again, accusing each other of eavesdropping. Just then, the temple monk comes out from inside and asks what they are arguing about. The two tell him the story. The monk laughs and says, "Gentlemen, please do not argue. The plaque is still in the back room and has not been hung yet." The two return in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you are drawing your swords, ready to strike, faces red with anger, arguing vehemently. Aren't you similar to them?</p>

<p>— Chen Jiaqing</p>
<p>The prosperity of Shanghai, the beauty of Jiangnan, spring breezes cause sorrow overnight. Look, the ashes of the disaster are everywhere, all turned into ruined cities. I remember the spring scenery filled my eyes, the reds and greens were intoxicating, and singing and dancing prevailed. But now, dry wells and dilapidated walls evoke boundless sadness.</p>
<p>Our great rivers and mountains are carelessly abandoned, causing alarm. Alas, drinking the blood of the Xiongnu, devouring the flesh of the foreign invaders, one basket of earth completes the task. A million soldiers are still there; don't laugh, wait for the snail's fight. I think of the capital, thousands of miles away, where the mournful sound of the horns is not heard.</p>

<p>After a long time in Shanghai, I returned to my province this year, going west from Guangdong. Feeling what I saw:</p>
<p>Helping each other late, meeting is also fate. Just awakened from a dream, I boarded the boat. Going west, the soldiers are numerous; coming east, the scenery is changing. At night, we talked about national affairs, but I dared not speak in front of others.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Classification of Rubber Product Manufacturing Methods and Overview of Factories in China <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhibin</p>
<p>Rubber Overview. This supplement already has a considerable introduction, but the actual working conditions of the factory and the types of manufacturing methods, and the development of this career in China, are probably also something readers are pleased to hear, so I will briefly describe the services I have received, as follows:</p>
<p>Rubber has been valued by the world for its vulcanization method, so its manufacturing method is to add sulfur and make it work. However, there are various working methods, and those that have been used in factories can actually be simply divided into four categories:</p>
<p>(1) Hot Vulcanization Method: Many products are made by this method, and it is impossible to list them all. The working steps are to mix rubber with compounding agents, and then add sublimated sulfur, fully mixed in a mixing machine, rolled into a plate shape, formed into goods, and sent to a heater for oxidation. However, there are many types of heaters and methods, such as "direct hot vulcanization". Representative products include shoe heels and rubber bricks. However, this method is too old and is rarely used now. "Direct steam vulcanization" In addition to heating, mixed rubber products also need to be pressurized. This method is very advantageous for products because of the steam pressure. However, those with surface color relationships are not applicable. "Indirect steam vulcanization" There are many different forms of this device, but its principle is to pass steam through a snake tube and heat it in a secret chamber or container, but there is only heat and no pressure, and there are many shortcomings. However, engineers can still remedy it with appropriate drugs, depending on whether the engineer can use it. "Indirect steam pressure vulcanization" This method uses an air pump machine to increase air pressure, or a press in a compressor. Many factories are using it now. In addition, there are those who use electric heat instead of steam heat, but because the cost is higher, there are few users. Most of the methods used by various factories in China are hot vulcanization methods.</p>
<p>(2) Cold Vulcanization Method: This method uses green gas and sulfur compounds to complete the vulcanization and oxidation process at room temperature. I have not heard of any factories in China using this method to make products. Products should be thin sheets, such as medical equipment, children's toys, and rubber gloves, all of which can be vulcanized by this method. There are also those who use both cold and hot methods to make products such as raincoats.</p>
<p>(3) Air Vulcanization Method: This method also has two types, one is a variation of hot vulcanization, and the other is a variation of cold vulcanization. The former melts sulfur in a container, unlike the hot vulcanization method, which uses sulfur mixed with products. The United States calls this method the sulfur mine bath method, because the products are bathed in sulfur air. The latter sends a recorded sulfur compound gas into a secret chamber where the products have been placed to complete the vulcanization work. There are many products such as gloves, hot water bags, diving caps, and life buoys, and the properties are better than those made by the cold vulcanization method, because cold vulcanized products are slightly weaker in toughness and tensile force.</p>
<p>(4) High-Pressure Heavy Heat Vulcanization Method: This method requires that the rubber be turned into a solid, and 2-3% of sulfur iodine must be added, and it must be oxidized under high pressure and heat for a long time, and the coordination method is also very important. Usually high-grade oil wax is used to help it be dense and smooth. The finished product is commonly called Bakelite. It has insulation and is used for electrical material decorations, records, and fountain pen shafts, but if the manufacturing method is poor, it will soften when exposed to heat.</p>
<p>The history of China's rubber chemical industry is less than 100 years. Most of the products are made by the hot vulcanization method, and shoes are the most famous. Other things still need to be revitalized, so the level is actually very childish. Because the country is restless, the asset class is always less interested in industry, and there is a great shortage of technical personnel. There are often cases of hiring foreign technicians, so technology cannot be improved through research, and engineering power is controlled by others, and domestic raw materials cannot be used. Among the raw materials, there are many natural raw materials in China such as zinc oxide, lead oxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, chalk, and all special rubber oil agents, rubber substitutes, etc., which can be easily chemically made. It is a pity that Chinese people do not research or have little transportation, and capitalists are superstitious in foreigners, and the power of profit overflows, which is regrettable.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Meeting <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>

<p>(1)</p>
<p>On the bulletin board were pasted various notices of different sizes, colors, and fonts, all with the same (or similar) message:</p>
<p>"This association will hold its nth regular meeting on the nth day of the month at the nth hour in classroom nth. All members are requested to attend." [Name of Association, Date]</p>
<p>There are at least three to five gatherings every day. Some are alumni associations, some are student associations, and there are also various societies and groups. Anyway, as long as there are people, there is a name. College students have plenty of money and time, so why not be "active"?</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Several young ladies were sitting in the shade of a tree, causing the gentleman who was recruiting people for the meeting to sweat profusely. I saw him put on a solemn expression, trying to suppress his nervous mood, and said to Ms. A, who was known as an activist:</p>
<p>"Ms. A, please go to classroom X to attend the meeting." He seemed both relieved and resentful. Ms. A muttered to herself as she got up:</p>
<p>"It's really tiring to call people to meetings every day." Indeed, Ms. A is very hardworking. Her name is always on the list of officers in every association.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The W Society was holding an executive committee meeting. The male executives had all arrived, but Ms. C was still late. The chairman pleaded repeatedly, and everyone agreed to wait. However, when the chairman returned from the fourth invitation, he reported:</p>
<p>"Ms. O hasn't finished her hair yet and probably can't come to the meeting..."</p>
<p>"Why do women automatically give up their due rights?" This was the voice of a sentimentalist.</p>
<p>This meeting seemed to pass in a spiritless manner.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Conditions for Seeking Love <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— A Niu</p>
<p>I often see couples of men and women walking hand in hand in the park and on the road, whispering endless sweet words. But after careful examination of their results, although I don't have precise statistics, the end result is often a tragic comedy in which they break up and hire lawyers to go to court. Why? Because they don't meet the following six conditions.</p>
<p>The first condition: if you want to seek a beautiful lover, then ask yourself, how much property do you have? Or how much income do you have each month? Is it enough for your lover to buy long stockings, high-heeled leather shoes, cheongsams, dance dresses, French cosmetics, and all kinds of miscellaneous expenses?</p>
<p>The second condition: do you have a western-style house and a car? Of course! How can a lover as beautiful as a peach blossom and as lovely as jade be crowded into a low bungalow and lightly move her jade feet to run on the road? So you have to prepare an exquisite western-style house where you can hide your beauty, and a new-style car where you can take a joyride or drive to the dance floor.</p>
<p>The third condition: what is your own or your father's or brother's position in society? Are you a highly respected PhD, master, expert, or even a chairman, president, or minister in the national government, or a mayor in a city, a county magistrate in a county, or a commander-in-chief, army commander, division commander, brigade commander, or regiment commander holding a gun?</p>
<p>The fourth condition: what is your appearance? First, you have to take a mirror and look at yourself. If you can pass the test, then there is no problem. If you are very ugly or have a face full of freckles, then a weasel can't eat swan meat.</p>
<p>The fifth condition: what is your level of education? If you are a middle school student, then don't think about finding a college student as a lover. You can only find an elementary school graduate. If you are a college student, you can only pair with a middle school student. If you are a PhD or master who has returned from studying abroad, then you can pick any college student you want. If you are only an elementary school graduate, then you can only pick an illiterate person who has not studied.</p>
<p>The sixth condition: do you have a slavish nature? Are you willing to be at your lover's beck and call? If you don't have any of the above six conditions, then no matter how hard you try, the arrow of love will not visit you. Even if it does, you will not enjoy your blessings forever.</p>
<p>But what about these Misses? I say, please rest assured! As long as you put on a few layers of rouge and powder, someone will come after you.</p>

<h3 id="e224">Fortune Teller <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>I remember when I was working at the Kunshan XX Central Elementary School, one afternoon after class, a dozen colleagues who lived at school were gathered in a corner of the playground, chatting and laughing. A tinkling bell sound reached our ears. I walked out of the school gate and saw that it was a fortune teller. From a distance, what made us laugh the most was his appearance, so we called him in. He was a middle-aged man in his thirties, with a sallow face and black teeth, obviously an opium addict. He wore a white bamboo cloth long shirt that was as dirty as a tablecloth, and he was dragging a pair of broken black cloth shoes. In his hand, he carried a large British brand cigarette box. Inside the box, of course, were the tools he used to cheat people out of food. After he sat down, he opened his treasure chest.</p>
<p>"What kind of character?"</p>
<p>"I dropped a fountain pen. I don't know if I can find it." I put on a solemn expression and told him seriously. My colleagues all thought it was a serious matter and watched. "Oh, how many days ago did you drop it?"</p>
<p>"More than a week ago."</p>
<p>"Bring out a piece of paper!" Hao casually grabbed one and opened it. It was the character "木" (wood). He began to expound his theory, determining that it could not be found. Hao suddenly laughed and took out his good old Parker from his pocket and said, "I didn't drop it..." The fortune teller's face turned red immediately. We also touched our heads and laughed loudly, clapping our hands and stomping our feet. Finding himself in a dead end, the fortune teller stood up, bowed to us, and began to recount his experiences. "To be honest with you gentlemen, I am a normal school graduate. I have been a primary school teacher for several years. It was my own fault that I got addicted to opium. My family property was used up, and I couldn't be a teacher anymore. There was really no way, so I had to resort to this tactic. I hope you gentlemen will forgive my suffering..." As he spoke, he expressed infinite pain. We were also stunned by his words for a long time.</p>

<p>Reply Letter to Mr. Gong,</p>
<p>Respectfully, yesterday I happened to read this newspaper and saw the inquiries from Mr. Tang and Mr. Yang regarding my business. Now I respectfully answer as follows. Mr. Tang's inquiries regarding "direct, spicy, Nikahn oil, etc." can be purchased at all chemical industrial raw material stores (such as the Practical Learning and Art Hall and the Scientific Instrument Hall on Chessboard Street). The prices vary with time, and each store also has ups and downs, so it is not convenient to inform in detail. Please inquire at each store yourself.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's inquiry about sodium chloride can also be purchased from the stores listed above. As for how much warm water to use for one ounce of sodium chloride, it is related to the temperature of the water in which the sodium chloride is dissolved. If the temperature is high, less water is needed, so please use your discretion. Dissolving sodium chloride in water will absolutely not cause an explosion or danger.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Gong.</p>
