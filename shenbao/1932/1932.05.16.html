<p>時評</p>
<h3>闢所謂上海自由市彬</h3>
<p>目一二八滬變發生以來。所謂上海自由市之呼聲。即甚囂塵上。日政客松岡洋右二次來華。聞即爲企圖實現此一陰謀。而遊説外僑及各國公使。最近僑滬一部分日人。亦主張反對日軍撤退。並要求停止一切反日運動。而外相芳澤且向英美法意四國駐日大使提議。改上海爲國際自由市。市之周圍永遠爲不駐兵區域。是則日人之野心與陰謀。今已具體顯露。而此一問題。吾人今更應嚴密注意。不容忽視。　　夫日人之所以决然掀起一二八之慘變者。其眞實用意顯然爲欲佔領上海。打破門户開放機會均等之原則。以壟斷長江流域之商業。但以吾國抗日軍之英武抵抗。及英美交嫉志無由逞。故乃造成所謂上海自由市之空氣煽惑列强。協以謀我。其計劃誠極爲毒辣。然而世人耳目。旣非可以一手掩盡。而此種破壞我領土行政主權之完整之謬論。如我民族而尚未喪失其立國之精神。又爲吾人所能容許其實現。　　猶記在一八六二年（清同治元年）大平軍進攻上海之際。所謂上海自由市之計劃。亦曾一度宣傳。但以英使白羅司及英領麥特赫司脱之反對。故議無成。英使白羅司且曰。（上海租界之性質。旣非割讓。亦非租借。凡我人所有之地産。仍屬中國之領土。嗣後愼勿出此不依國際法而肆行要求之言。）此六十年前之事實。今尚存於吾人記憶中也。即僑滬外人應亦尚未健忘。以六十年前所未容實現之計劃。今乃欲復燃其死。是不僅爲不智。抑且恰足以證明其尚以六十年前之眼光。視我今日正在積極掙扎奮鬥中之民族。　　所謂自由市之先例。在歐洲則有唐齊。唐齊爲德國舊土。地臨波羅的海。而波蘭則欲取爲出海之口。互相爭奪。相持不下。最後乃由國際聨盟定爲自由城然波蘭之（走廊問題）與德國之（東普魯士問題。）相爭益甚。上海爲自由市之議。究依據於何種理由耶。將謂爲維持上海之永久和平乎。則此次滬變之發生。顯然爲日人所一手造成。抑且從來持中立政策之租界。其中立性亦被破壞。是則如欲維持上海永遠之和平。其唯一之道。在於裁制侵略者之野心。蓋至爲顯然。以一種强力奪取他國之領土。闢爲國際自由市。而猶曰維持和平。質之公理與正義。果能自圓其説耶。　　夫九國公約。今固尚未廢棄也。保持中國領土行政主權之完整之原則。亦固爲列國所公認也。而日人。乃公然發爲狂悖之謬論。企圖在我國内建立一國中之國。其蔑視我主權爲何如。其蹂躪公理與正義更爲何如。此種蹂躪公理與正義之謬論。吾人應堅持有力之抗議。更深信世界愛護正義之人士。當能予以嚴正之糾正。　　於此。吾人更敢以至誠爲日僑告。邇年以來。中日邦交之愈趨惡化。其眞實原因究何在。日人應自知之。日軍閥財閥不惜窮兵黷武。决然實力發動激起九一八與一二八之慘變。日本人民除增加數千萬元之公債担負。併犧牲無數無辜之人民於肉搏之戰塲。僑滬日人。除使其所營各業皆陷於全部停頓而外。所得者更有何物。欲改善中日間之感情。必改善對華之侵略政策。而一部份僑滬日人。顧乃在今日仍不覺悟。尚爲虎作倀。助長軍閥之氣燄。高談所謂上海自由市之主張。是則中日關係之前途。殆仍將愈步入可悲之境。然而。此又果爲大多數日人之利耶。有識之日人其二思之。日本海陸軍人大暴動</p>

<h3>上週大有蓬勃氣象</h3>
<p>久遠沉悶之棉紗、在上週間驟形活躍、大有進展、頗具蓬勃之景氣、推其原因如下、　　（一）中日停戰協定、業經簽字、日兵開始撤退、（二）滬埠金融界視局勢漸形恢復、對於正當營業或可有調劑輔助之意、不若前日之呆木矣、（三）日軍退出之區、交過當局已在竭力設法、使其早日回復原狀、附近江浙一帶之各布廠、前受戰事打華、皆告停閉、目下　於時局和平、均有復工開業之消息、對於原料必須採辦、（四）二十支人鐘紗價與二月份高峯時已跌去二十三四兩之譜、四十二支人鐘線竟跌去七十五兩之巨、棉紗一項爲人生必須之物、有此四大原因、各帮一時環境轉良、遂紛紛大量採辦、但北方一路在日軍勢力範圍中、棉紗早已被其佔據、華紗無揷足餘地、惟華南一埠久已岑寂、在此週中極力購買、查粤·滇·閩·三處爲最多、次之長沙·江西·四川三帮亦屬不惡、查各帮買去統計二萬二千八百七十包、同業中有四千包、各廠在此週中開出不少、行情比前週漲二三兩不等、紗銷之旺、爲滬變後之第一聲、但據另一方面調杳、各帮在此番發展中、買去棉紗約有四萬包左右、不過有許多廠商自己裝運各埠、市塲上難以明瞭、且有一部份尚不願發表詳細情形、須查海關報告爲證、週末現紗需求各方胃口有館滿之狀、一般人心又有觀疲之象、而各廠底貨鬆去不少、廠家間有已將售罄者、所以態度較昻、至於客方有此巨量買進之後、當然有一度休息、照大勢狀態測之、紗價或將盤旋一時、但原料尚廉、廠方成本便宜、而世界棉業狀况尚在疲憊不振中、且日廠進行猛力、勁敵尤多、前途情形殊不敢必也、交易所人標星期一以五九停市、外面現需起色已發動、故星期二開出、盤盤升高、一日中漲跳三兩六錢、後以各帮購買繼續不斷、中途形勢緊俏、漲風鋭利、然成交數未有巨額存賬、所以市况尚和平、週末人心略轉和緩、以四方經濟一時不克十分流通、原料甚廉、而紗銷恐無積極之力、有一部份看疲、盤遂現轉落之狀也、各月份價比前週漲高三四兩、成交數統計五萬六千六百包、茲將各帮口買去數量分列於後、帮口　包額　　　帮口　包額　　　汕頭　三三八五　福建　　四○廣東　八四九○　雲南　一二六○　長沙　一五九○　蕪湖　　一○内地　一七六○　鎭江　二一五　　漢口　　　四五　温州　　一三五北帮　五六○　　安慶　四五　　　天津　一一○　　威海衛　　二○</p>

<h3>窮樂師暴富記</h3>

<h3>勗中國小貓</h3>
<p>— 磐谿</p>
<p>法國有怪傑克勒滿沙者。徽號曰老虎。法人又頌之爲勝利之父。爲歐戰時手腕剛强才氣縱横之法總理。克氏曾著一書。名曰勝利的偉大與悲哀。其中多臧否當世人物之作。述及巴黎和議時各國外交家的態度。屢稱我國代表顧維鈞氏爲（中國小貓）。當時顧氏爲力爭山東問題。在會塲中屢有激昻之辯論。克氏頗爲心折。因自居老虎。遂以小貓喻顧。一時傳爲佳話。然不免自負心理之太顯耳。余以爲動物之有益人類者。貓實遠勝於虎。爲其能捕鼠也。虎常傷人。貓常益人。相去不甚遠乎。就以凶猛論。貓亦不讓於虎。請以李太白詩爲證。（此詩後出不載李翰林集）前清乾隆朝。山西某縣設乩壇。某日李太白降壇。壇弟子以太白爲唐之詩人。請賜詩。適見一貓在廊下。因指以爲題。乩仙謂題目太易。可限韻。乃以（九韮酒）三字爲限。此三字實與題目不相干。可云難矣。乩仙立即走筆成七絶一首云。（貓形似虎十八九。吃盡魚蝦不吃韭。只因捕鼠太猖狂。翻倒床頭一壺酒）。以此詩觀之。貓雖小。亦何讓老虎之威風哉。今此形似老虎善於捕鼠之小貓。方爲國盡力。冒險出關。消息傳來。果然不畏日人之恐嚇。能拒叛逆之干涉。尤望始終不屈不撓。把公然白晝出現之。（白日鼠）一一捕盡。則禮記所云（迎貓爲其食田鼠）一語。可爲顧氏誦。事畢歸來。受各界之熱烈歡迎而無愧色矣。勗哉小貓。其以余言爲息壤哉。</p>

<h3>有飯大家吃</h3>
<p>— 芮荃</p>
<p>昨天我和兩位朋友，走遇華繁的某路上，正值家家户户先後午餐的當兒，有的已經吃過，有的正在吃着，有的剛在要吃，映在眼簾裏的，使人體會得出他們是有飯吃，映樂的神情。不覺因此就談起了吃飯的問題，並談了一些吃飯的笑話。最耐人尋味的，是挨餓的人，見着人家吃飯，嗅着飯香，心理怪難受似的，甚至饞涎欲滴！突過一處，有兩人正在相擾着，好奇的我們，便站着看去，只見拳頭之下，路上擺着一擔飯筐，筐裏滿堆着收來的空飯桶，和許多空盤碗等。有一隻桶内有些括剩的飯，一盤雜七雜八的冷菜，和一碗雜湯，也都是括剩的。相擾的人，一個似是失業的工人，一個挑飯夫正是啞子，工人説：你剩下的飯給了我吃吧！啞子口裏啞啞……手舞足蹈的表示不肯，以至閙起來了。在上海這樣搶飯吃的事情多着咧，無論你走到那一條馬路上那一條街上或是巷弄襄，天天總碰得着的。唉！，這是（小癟三！）咦！我着實爲這些（小癟三）難過，他們爲什麽没飯吃？如果是好吃懶做，那末餓死也不足惜！倘或是遭意外而失掉飯碗的，社會人士正當予以同情和援助，使失業者復業，無業者有業，人人有工做，人人有飯吃。那末，文明的上海，才算名副其實了。</p>
<h3>故都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>自國民政府成立以來。到處有青白之旗色。凡公署牆垣楹檻及文告一切。皆飾此二色。其青色多嫌淺薄。一經風雨。不待終年。已呈剝蝕。實與觀瞻有礙。顧卒無起而糾正之者。案天之蒼蒼其正色邪。青天宜用深青。殆數千年沿襲之觀念。惟深青能代表吾國文化之特殊精神也。以吾所見。惟故都中央公園之中山堂四壁作石青地。堊以粉字。最爲美觀。然他處仍以淡青飾於丹垣之上。丹色不移。而青痕已落。陸離斑駮。至爲可憎。美城之中。斯爲一玷。往時有何人主張將宮殿黄瓦丹垣悉改青白。適歐洲某藝術家游於此地。急揚言於衆曰。北京宮闕以黄瓦敵青天。以丹垣隠綠樹。每當夕陽映射。幻成奇彩。方知昔人意匠之精。此舊邦文化僅存之殘影。幸勿摧毁。如不見聽。則從此歐西人士返駕不前矣。此語爲有識者所附和。幸免於厄。西人僑居故都者愛護文物。甚於國人。蓋學術與藝術無國界可言。不嫌於越俎也。吾又聞有藝術家爲進一步之創論曰。故都之美。不在黄瓦丹垣。而在青衫之色。往年工商界多服青衣。近數年則中上流階級男女皆染此風。雖内襲華服。亦必以青衫爲表。蓋故都所出毛藍布色韻沈厚。與此古城之環境適相調和。一種柔靜幽雅之標格。足以暎帶成趣。非善於體會物情不能發此論也。故都學校生徒人數激增。服此者尤衆。衢路間盈目皆是。近且風尚傳至南方。懿此青衫。其將永久代表古國樸雅之風乎。</p>
<h3>戰地拾零</h3>
<p>— 保鄭</p>
<p>淞滬戰端旣開。我青年投筆從戎。捨身取義者。頗不乏人。然而因不諳軍事。毫無經騐。以致臨陣慌亂。手足無措者。亦復不尠。有李君者。曾任國術館教練。善拳術。精技擊。孔武有力。聞日軍犯滬。怒髮裂眥。氣憤塡膺。星夜奔滬。投入義勇軍。擔任後方運輸事宜。然李君終以未能親臨前綫。手殲倭人爲憾也。入後。戰事日趨激烈。扼守吳淞附近之我軍。以衆寡懸殊。勢且不守。而後援不至。危在旦夕。乃急調義勇軍分編各隊。加入作戰。以壯聲勢。李君遂入機關槍隊。未幾。遥望敵人三五成羣。迤邐前進。李君一躍登先。手扳機鈕。欲即迎射。同隊二機關槍手急止之曰。敵未逼近。徒耗子彈。於事無補也。李君以爲彼等欺其門外漢。有意挪揄。堅持不可。正爭持間。忽彈如連珠。掠頸而過。李君大駭。驚仆壕内。面色如土。二槍手覩狀。不禁啞然失笑。乃從容不迫。開槍掃射。敵人果不得逞。計窮而退。返視李君。則鼾聲如雷。已入夢境矣。</p>

<h3>戎馬雙樓記（五三）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第七回干謁到豪門常使將軍顚倒幽覊在情獄卒能夫婿牢籠　　凡是注定會得著的。似乎那一天都有機會能將名次提前。很容易被承啟官領了你上去。若是活該輪不著的。那就自然會把你屢次都刷在頂後頭。每天總是白跑一趟或白等候那許久的辰光。這一回。又不知是那些位候不着的人兒倒霉。葉督軍尚只會了半個多鐘頭的客。共總還没把那一大羣候見的人見滿三分之一。正與一位客談完了那幾分鐘。把那人親送到客廳門邊却被剛才那個名呌德順的走到門旁。輕輕向葉督軍耳畔説了幾句話。葉督軍登時就一聲不響。逕自走出了客廳。頭也不回的同着那德順向内室去了。撇下一員承啟官。手裏還自拿了好幾張名剌。痴呆呆的立在一旁。没來得及往上回明。也没曾請示今天還見不見。眼見這樁公事是没法交代。然而那人究是個老辦公事的。靈機一動。拔足也就向外跑道。痛愉把他們打發散了罷。五太太請。准有好樂子。今天是不會再見客的了。這裏且説葉作章興冲冲走進本宅最後一進一個極精緻的中式院落内。逕奔五太太的内室。德順緊貼身忙把門窗撩起。朝内通報。説是大帥來啦。葉作章却早已鑽進去狂笑亂嚷道。哈哈。是梁笑雲老八看望我來了嗎。我聽着比打了大勝仗還快活。敢情是老八小心眼兒已活動。這一回肯嫁給我了。那時。梁笑雲正與五太太對躺在一張床上同守着個燈盤子。見了葉作章。連忙笑吟吟地立起來。還未答言。那在床上躺着的五太太。亂髮　鬆。花容不整。只披了一件旗袍。還剩有左襟上幾粒鈕子來扣。露出内裏的緊身小馬甲。却大馬金刀。紋風不動。搶過來就對葉作章貶了貶白眼道。你一進來總是這樣哇啦哇啦的亂嚷。我勸你少胡説八道吧。人家如今已嫁了人。做了安太太了。葉作章故意做出驚訝的神色來道。怎麽。老八嫁人啦。是那一個姓安的。現今閙人們好像並没有姓這個的人。這一是個小白。比我這。大草包長得俊。所以才没有我的份呢。説着。仍是嬉皮笑臉的向梁笑雲身邊擠來。</p>

<h3>無光探照燈</h3>
<p>— 薦櫻樓</p>
<p>探照燈在軍事上的效用，至爲重大，可是在昏黯的黑夜，或在濃霧迷濛之時，咫尺不辨，稍一失愼，很容易中敵人的暗算，尤其在海戰時的敵艦，和空戰時的敵機，委實無法窺探其虚實，但是有光探照燈有一個很大的缺點，就是在戰爭的時候，常常被敵方所利用，循光覓徑，反成了敵彈的瞄準的鵠的，所以一般軍事學家，對於探照燈的實用，總以此引爲絶大的遺憾，到一九二七年間，英國名科學家佩特氏，經過長時間的悉心研究，才彌補了這個遺憾，而發明了一種無光的探照燈，　　這種探照燈，英文名爲Noctovisor，牠的構造形式，和平常的探照燈没有甚麽著顯的差别，祇是牠的光線的發射，却絶非平常人的視覺所能夠感覺的，牠的發明原理，完全是採用一種日光中的（紅外線）爲其最大的要素，　　我們都知道太陽的光帶，賅含著紅橙黄綠青藍紫七種顔色，而據光學家的研究，知道紫光線和紅光線的外面，還有一種紫外綫和一種紅外綫，這兩種光綫，都不是常人所能目睹的，紫外綫具有很强的化學作用，可以療治疾病，並可以辨别珍物的眞僞，　　最近更發見紫外綫可以應用在軍事上作秘密通信傳遞消息的效用，而紅外綫，他有很劇烈的光力，所以又名（熱綫），他的光波比較光波最長的紅光綫，還長出一百六十多倍，佩特氏就利用此種紅外綫，而成功他的驚人發明，他先製造一種橡皮質的歛光器械，裝置在尋常探照燈的鏡頭前，收歛各種光線，而僅使紅外線發射，同時更利用那種有聲電影和電視術中的重要工具（電照管）的效能，使被射的對象，毫髮不爽地呈視在我們的眼前，　　這種神秘的探照燈的發明，眞足以使全世界的軍事學家相顧失色，近經試騐的結果，復知此種無光探照燈的光線透射力，比較尋常的探照燈加强至三百倍以上，雖在重霧昏夜，都没有阻碍，我們設想到在作戰時，一方運用此燈，同時更佐以觀測瞄準的器械，如最新發明的電器聨動式觀測器，維克預測器等物，使彈丸無虚發，剷滅强敵在不知不覺中，這種危險物的發明，對未來戰爭的恐怖性，又不知增加幾許咧</p>

<h3>三個中國巡捕</h3>

<p>｜靜安寺廟會所見　　在靜安寺前擠滿了人羣，老的少的，男的女的，誰的臉上都泛着深淺不同的喜氣；來的去的，一個緊接着一個，一羣緊接着一羣。　　忽然一個中國巡捕提着一位小販的衣領推開人羣跑來，於是無事的人們也就順便的佇立而望。　　（先生！大家齊是中國人。可憐我罷，阿拉做小生意格！……）小販回轉頭來向巡捕請求着，眼睛裏幾乎要掉下涙來。　　（嘸啥好講，到巡捕房去，阿拉勿管！）　　這位（先生）終於揚起他的木棍抓着犯人過去。總算還有一個老婆婆嘆息着説；（可憐得來！）　　於是人們仍是擁擠，一個又一個，一羣又一羣。　　我知道，這是一個中國的洋警察。　　×　　　　　　　×　　在電車站旁邊又是一羣，高的矮的，胖的瘦的，站成一個半弧形。他們都同一方向的向裏着，長的伸長頸，短的趾立着。　　一個賣小調兒的小伙子從裏面發出一片頗有韻律的歌聲，字字清晰。　　（……××人放個屁，中國人當做綠氣砲，啊喲喲，不得了，提起腿來拚命跑！拚命跑，拚命跑，頭上的飛機嗡嗡呌！···）　　（好哇！眞唱得好！）羣衆中發出一片呼聲。在這當中，歌者却乘機賣了幾本歌曲了。隨後他又唱；　　（江北人，不是人，做個漢奸殺死自家中國人。啊喲喲，…）歌聲突然終止。忽然一個中國巡捕擠了進來，口裏喊着；（去去去！）揮起他的木棍，揚起他的喉音。於是歌者跑了，人羣也跟着散開。啊！好不威風。我想想這也是一個中國的洋警察。　　×　　×　　×　　在赫德路口還是擠着許多人。看熱閙的，買賤貨的。男的碰着女的香肩，小孩兒在大人的脇下攅去。他靠着他，她又靠着她。　　一個老年的羅宋，肩負着他的磨刀的活車，由這邊走到那邊，羨慕的，長眉毛的掩蓋處射出貪慾的眼光，在一個舊衣帽的攤前他更立定着不走，人們必得要在他的架下攅過。於是一個中國巡捕在他的肩頭上拍了一下，先笑了一笑然後和藹的説（去！）可是這外國人反轉來馬上便噴了一嘴的唾沬，破口駡道；　　猪　！癟三！爲啥要我跑？；）　　然而這一位巡捕却眞是大量，只是笑着走開去，一根木棍和褲子一同垂下衣下。於是那白俄駡得更加利害，可是誰也聽不清。這時好像有人在説；　　（外國人到底威風！）又有人説；　　（中國巡捕原來如此。）啊！這又是一個中國的洋警察。</p>

<h3>郵資加價中</h3>
<p>— 楊颿</p>
<p>▲郵局賠錢揀信　　這次郵資的加價是没有什麽理由的，我們至少可以説，這次的郵資加價理由並不充分，　　然而政府的明令是已經頒佈了，在郵局的職員和地位上講起來，也只有惟命是從，但政府却又因了人民的反對而有折中辦法的决議，這使寫信的人們徬徨於迷途了，究竟貼四分好呢？五分好呢？還是六分好呢？　　於是，有許多人因爲信件並不要緊，同時又想使用民衆的力量以達到撤消加價的目的，便都只貼四分，有許多人因爲信件非常重要，如情書，借錢，要僨等等，爲保證在途中不會遺失不致延誤起見，便都慷慨地貼了六分，還有一部分人以爲貼四分又恐怕使收信人遭麻煩，貼六分又不肯使自己受額外的損失，因之採取折中辦法貼五分的也有，説起來倒還算是遵從以府新决議的，　　然而困難却終於來了，在郵局每天扛進扛出的千百包信件裏却貼着互相差異的不等的郵票，郵政當局因爲没有接</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>到新令，所以仍然只能照加價的命令實行，但這種處罰，欠資等等的手續的履行，原有的人員顯然是不夠分配了，於是又添請了十六個人，來帮同辦理，　　昨天一位郵務生抱怨地和我説，　　這種揀法眞是蝕本生意，你想，添用了十六個人，以侮個人每月化五十元計算，也已經八百元了，但每月收到的欠資却最多不過五百元，　　最後他又説，　　目下欠資信件達總數十分之二，但已經忙得不亦樂乎了，</p>

<h3>Commentary on the So-Called Shanghai Free City</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident occurred, the cry for a so-called "Shanghai Free City" has become rampant. It is said that Japanese politician Yosuke Matsuoka, during his second visit to China, attempted to realize this conspiracy by lobbying foreign residents and diplomats. Recently, a segment of Japanese residents in Shanghai has also advocated against the withdrawal of Japanese troops and demanded a cessation of all anti-Japanese movements. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa has proposed to the ambassadors of Great Britain, the United States, France, and Italy in Japan to transform Shanghai into an international free city, with its surroundings permanently demilitarized. This reveals the ambition and conspiracy of the Japanese in concrete terms, and we must pay close attention to this issue and not neglect it.</p>
<p>The real intention behind the Japanese resolutely launching the tragic January 28th Incident was clearly to occupy Shanghai, break the principles of the Open Door Policy and equal opportunity, and monopolize commerce in the Yangtze River basin. However, due to the valiant resistance of our country's anti-Japanese army and the jealousy of Great Britain and the United States, their ambition could not be fulfilled. Therefore, they created the atmosphere of a so-called "Shanghai Free City" to incite the powers to conspire against us. Their plan is truly insidious. However, the eyes and ears of the world cannot be covered by one hand, and this absurd argument of destroying the integrity of our territorial and administrative sovereignty, if our nation has not lost its spirit of independence, is something we cannot allow to be realized.</p>
<p>It is worth remembering that during the Taiping Rebellion's attack on Shanghai in 1862 (the first year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty), the plan for a so-called "Shanghai Free City" was once propagated. However, due to the opposition of British envoy Frederick Bruce and British Consul Medhurst, the proposal failed. British envoy Bruce even said, "The nature of the Shanghai concessions is neither cession nor lease. All land owned by our people still belongs to Chinese territory. Henceforth, refrain from making such demands that do not comply with international law." This fact from sixty years ago is still in our memory. Even the foreign residents in Shanghai should not have forgotten it. Now, to attempt to revive a plan that was not allowed to be realized sixty years ago is not only unwise, but also precisely demonstrates that they still view our nation, which is actively struggling and fighting, with the eyes of sixty years ago.</p>
<p>The precedent for so-called "free cities" exists in Europe with Danzig. Danzig was old German territory, located on the Baltic Sea, and Poland wanted to take it as an outlet to the sea. They fought fiercely over it, and could not come to an agreement. Finally, the League of Nations designated it as a free city. However, Poland's "corridor problem" and Germany's "East Prussia problem" became even more contentious. What reasons are the basis for the proposal to make Shanghai a free city? Is it to maintain the permanent peace of Shanghai? The occurrence of the recent Shanghai Incident was clearly created single-handedly by the Japanese, and the neutrality of the concessions, which had always maintained a neutral policy, was also violated. Therefore, if one wants to maintain the permanent peace of Shanghai, the only way is to curb the ambition of the aggressor. This is self-evident. To forcibly seize the territory of another country and establish it as an international free city, while claiming to maintain peace, can this be justified in the face of reason and justice?</p>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty is still not abolished. The principle of maintaining the integrity of China's territorial and administrative sovereignty is also recognized by all nations. Yet, the Japanese openly express this absurd and outrageous argument, attempting to establish a country within a country in our country. How much do they disregard our sovereignty? How much more do they trample on reason and justice? We should firmly and strongly protest this absurd argument of trampling on reason and justice. Furthermore, we deeply believe that people around the world who cherish justice will give a stern correction to this.</p>
<p>Here, we also dare to sincerely tell the Japanese residents in Shanghai: In recent years, why has the relationship between China and Japan deteriorated? The Japanese should know the real reason themselves. The Japanese militarists and financiers do not hesitate to resort to militarism and recklessly launch the tragic September 18th and January 28th Incidents. The Japanese people, in addition to increasing tens of millions of yuan in public debt, also sacrificed countless innocent people on the battlefield. What have the Japanese residents in Shanghai gained other than causing all their businesses to come to a complete standstill? To improve the relationship between China and Japan, the policy of aggression against China must be improved. However, a part of the Japanese residents in Shanghai, even today, remain unenlightened and continue to act as accomplices, fueling the arrogance of the militarists and advocating for the so-called "Shanghai Free City." In that case, the future of Sino-Japanese relations will likely continue to move towards a tragic situation. But is this truly beneficial for the majority of the Japanese people? The enlightened Japanese should consider this carefully. Major Mutiny by Japanese Navy and Army Personnel</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi Critically Wounded by Gunfire</h3>
<p>Six Mutiny Cases Occurred in Tokyo Last Night</p>
<p>Bomb Explosions at Seiyukai Headquarters, Metropolitan Police Department, Bank of Japan, and Private Residence of the Minister of the Imperial Household</p>
<p>Young Military Officers Invaded the Prime Minister's Residence and Fired Two Shots at the Prime Minister, Hitting Him Near the Temple, Resulting in a Very Serious Injury</p>
<p>Eighteen On-Duty Military Officers Surrendered Afterwards</p>
<p>Cabinet Resignation Depends on the Prime Minister's Condition</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 15th. Several outrageous acts occurred in Tokyo tonight, planned and executed with calmness, resulting in Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi being severely wounded, shaking the entire capital. Initially, three bombing incidents occurred tonight, with the bombers wearing either naval or army uniforms. One bomb was thrown into the Seiyukai headquarters, one into the Metropolitan Police Department, and the third into the private residence of the Minister of the Imperial Household, resulting in one death and one injury. At 5:30 PM, approximately ten individuals in military attire stormed into the Prime Minister's residence. Anyone who tried to stop them was shot down, injuring four police officers, one maid, and one guest. Once inside, an individual in an army officer's uniform fired two shots at the Prime Minister, one hitting him in the right temple and the other near his nose, resulting in a very critical injury. At the time, the Prime Minister was in conversation with a guest and was caught completely off guard. It was later learned that someone had also thrown a bomb into the Bank of Japan. Shortly after, eighteen individuals in naval or army officer's uniforms, claiming to be on-duty military officers, surrendered to the military police, stating that they had committed all five acts. The five acts that occurred tonight seemed to be planned meticulously and were interconnected, occurring within half an hour. Each time, a car carried the perpetrators. The Metropolitan Police Department suffered heavy damage due to the bomb explosion. The remaining bombs caused little damage and no deaths or injuries. The Metropolitan Police Department, in the same area where a Korean attempted to assassinate the Emperor with a bomb on January 8th of this year, was attacked today. The attackers first fired seven or eight shots at the building, followed by a hand grenade, causing a loud explosion that shook the surrounding area, injuring one police officer and one journalist. As they escaped in a car, the group scattered leaflets signed by the "Joint Association of Young Naval and Army Officers." The leaflets vehemently criticized the current state of the political parties and strongly condemned the actions of the country's diplomatic authorities, economic, educational, naval, army, and administrative officials. After a preliminary investigation, the eighteen individuals who surrendered were identified as five naval officers and thirteen army cadets. Tonight, a sixth act of violence occurred when someone threw a bomb near the Mitsui Bank, but there were no deaths or injuries, and the damage was not significant.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 15th. The Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi's daughter-in-law described the attack on the Prime Minister's residence, stating that she first heard sounds of fighting, followed by gunfire outside, then the sound of doors being broken down. Mrs. Inukai Tsuyoshi earnestly urged her husband to quickly hide, but the old man firmly refused and opened the door to the reception room. By then, the perpetrators had forced their way in. As they brandished their pistols, Inukai Tsuyoshi calmly addressed them and reprimanded them, saying that if they dared to shoot, they were welcome to do so. Thereupon, nine people simultaneously pulled the triggers, and Inukai Tsuyoshi immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely from his face and head. His condition is now very critical, and his life is in danger.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Tokyo, 15th. At 5:20 PM today, several individuals suddenly arrived at the Prime Minister's official residence in Nagata-cho, forced their way into the reception room. At the time, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was in conversation with a guest. The individuals immediately produced pistols and fired simultaneously, one bullet hitting Mr. Inukai's left forehead, not far from the temple. After the Prime Minister was injured, doctors were immediately summoned for treatment, but the bleeding could not be stopped, and the situation was extremely critical.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Tokyo, 15th. This afternoon, not only was Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi shot, but also several acts of violence were committed against senior government officials and financial figures, seemingly by members of the iron-fisted party. The assailants who attacked Inukai Tsuyoshi totaled six, all naval and army officers. Four were army officers, including one sergeant, with the ranks of the others unknown. Two were naval officers, one lieutenant, and one sub-lieutenant. These six individuals arrived at the Prime Minister's official residence in Nagata-cho at approximately 5:20 PM in a car, stating that they had important business and must see the Prime Minister immediately. At the time, Inukai Tsuyoshi was in the reception room, conversing with a guest. A guard, seeing that the visitors looked suspicious, advised the Prime Minister to retreat to another room. Inukai Tsuyoshi refused and ordered that they be received immediately. Thereupon, the six entered the room, immediately produced pistols. One army officer directly grabbed the Prime Minister's shoulder, twisted his body so that he faced the other five, and simultaneously ordered the five to fire. Two bullets struck Inukai Tsuyoshi, one entering his left forehead near the temple, and the other passing through his nose. After Inukai Tsuyoshi was injured, Dr. Aoyama of the Tokyo Imperial University Hospital was urgently summoned for emergency treatment and then sent to the hospital. According to Aoyama, although the injury was severe, there was still a possibility of saving his life, but the continuous bleeding was difficult to stop, making the injury extremely serious. However, a doctor's announcement at 11:40 PM tonight stated that his condition was very serious and almost hopeless. The six assailants immediately surrendered to the police station after the incident. Furthermore, two police officers from the Prime Minister's special guard, named Hiramatsu and Kawada, were also seriously injured. Hiramatsu was shot in the chest, and Kawada was shot in the abdomen. When the attack occurred at the Prime Minister's official residence in Nagata-cho at 5:20 PM, three other acts of violence occurred simultaneously. One was at the residence of Viscount Makino, the Minister of the Imperial Household, where someone threw two hand grenades, one exploding and one not exploding, but there was no damage. Because the surrounding area was heavily guarded, details could not be ascertained. Another was at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, where a young man in a gray coat fired a shot from outside a window at a senior police officer. The entire department was in turmoil, and twelve police officers immediately rushed out of the department. However, the young man did not flee and fired several more shots, injuring one police officer and one journalist, before escaping. It is said that both were seriously injured. At the same time, a bomb was thrown into the head office of the Mitsubishi Company, but details are still being kept secret. In addition, someone also threw two bombs at the headquarters of the Seiyukai at the same time. Afterwards, the Japanese Cabinet immediately convened an emergency cabinet meeting at 8:40 PM to discuss whether the cabinet needed to resign en masse. It is said that the outcome will be decided at a continuation of the meeting at 7:00 AM tomorrow, depending on the Prime Minister's condition. It is said that the ministers' attitude towards resignation will depend on the Prime Minister's condition. However, Army Minister Araki and Navy Minister Osumi entered the Imperial Palace at 9:00 PM to report the details of the violence to the Emperor. After the report, they returned to the Prime Minister's official residence to consult with the other ministers. There are widespread rumors that the two ministers of the army and navy have resigned to take responsibility, but this has not been confirmed by official sources. After the incident at the Police Department, an investigation was immediately launched. By 10:30 PM tonight, the entire Prosecutor General's Office had been mobilized to direct the investigation, and the Prosecutor General was personally handling the case.</p>
<p>▲ Our Beiping Special Dispatch: According to a Tokyo urgent telegram, Inukai Tsuyoshi was attacked with a pistol by thugs, and his abdomen was seriously injured. At the same time, bombs were discovered at the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The perpetrators did not escape.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 15th. The news of the shooting of Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi spread here like the detonation of a bomb, shattering the tranquility of the British and Japanese political circles at the end of the week. All sides are now earnestly inquiring about the Prime Minister's condition and expressing their condolences.</p>
<p>▲ Far East News Agency, Tokyo, 15th. After Prime Minister Inukai was attacked, the cabinet ministers were greatly alarmed. They gathered at the Prime Minister's official residence at 7:30 PM for a special meeting to discuss countermeasures. Army Minister Araki, who was resting in Kamakura, rushed back to Tokyo to participate in the special cabinet meeting and jointly devise a plan. After the meeting concluded at 9:00 PM, the Army Minister returned to the Army Minister's official residence and convened a meeting of the Army Ministry's headquarters. At 9:40 PM, Army Minister Araki proceeded to the Imperial Palace to report on the incident. The Emperor expressed concern about the matter. The Emperor also sent Suzuki, the aide-de-camp, to visit Prime Minister Inukai to express condolences.</p>
<p>▲ Another telegram: After Prime Minister Inukai was attacked and bombs exploded at the residences of Minister of the Imperial Household Makino, the House of Peers hall, etc., the Ministry of Home Affairs, fearing that the incident would affect the security of various regions, issued an order to all prefectures at 9:00 PM, urging them to be cautious and vigilant regarding security, stating that the Prime Minister's survival was still unpredictable.</p>
<p>▲ Another telegram: After the news of Prime Minister Inukai's attack was released, various parties were greatly stimulated by the news. The Seiyukai, to which the party belongs, decided to convene a general assembly of Seiyukai members of the House of Representatives at 10:00 AM tomorrow to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Receiving the Four Districts of Zhabei This Morning</h3>
<p>Personnel Were First Sent to Inspect and Six Methods Were Resolved</p>
<p>The Takeover Committee for the Retreating Areas of Dachang dispatched personnel yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to inspect the boundaries of the four districts of Zhabei, surveying the water and electricity plants and the police officer training school. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, they went to the Japanese Naval Headquarters to draft matters such as etiquette for the takeover. Personnel from our Takeover Committee and the Public Security Bureau went to Zhabei this morning at 7:30 AM to receive the area. The receiving area is limited to the area south of the Jinghu Railway, north of the Suzhou River, east of the Guangzhao Villa, and west of North Zhejiang Road. Details are as follows: Receiving Committee Members from the Zhabei Japanese Military Headquarters Went to Various Locations for Inspection</p>
<p>Zhabei Military Police Branch</p>
<p>▲ Far East News Agency, Tokyo, 15th Evening Dispatch: After Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was admitted to the Imperial University Hospital, doctors Shioda and Aoyama diagnosed him with severe condition due to excessive bleeding and old age, and first performed a blood transfusion. However, no effect was seen after the blood transfusion. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs' 11:00 PM announcement of the Prime Minister's condition: temperature 36, pulse 90, respiration 30.</p>
<p>▲ Another telegram: According to an announcement by Vice Minister of Home Affairs Shiokawa of the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs, the perpetrators have surrendered to the Metropolitan Police Department. The Ministry of Home Affairs is now conducting a thorough study overnight based on reports from the Military Police Headquarters and the Police Department.</p>
<p>▲ Another telegram: Army Minister Araki and Navy Minister Osumi successively went to the Imperial Palace and participated in an important cabinet meeting after withdrawing at 10:00 PM. The Tokyo District Court was very alarmed and issued an emergency order summoning thirty prosecutors, with Prosecutor General Oyama at the center, to hold a prosecutors' meeting to discuss the inspection procedures for the case.</p>
<p>▲ Another telegram: Regarding the circumstances of the Prime Minister's assassination, it is said that at 5:40 PM, five or six perpetrators broke into the official residence. Two police officers guarding the gate, named Tanaka Goro and Hinadoro, tried to stop them, but they did not listen. The perpetrators instead ordered the police officers to retreat quickly, otherwise, there would be trouble. When the police officers did not listen, the perpetrators drew their guns and fired. One police officer was shot in the chest, and the other was shot in the abdomen. At the time, Prime Minister Inukai was receiving guests in the room. Suddenly hearing gunshots, the guests and their family members suspected that something had happened and urged the Prime Minister to escape quickly. Inukai did not believe it, saying, "What could happen?" He personally went out to mediate and believed that nothing would happen. He stepped out, and at that time, the perpetrators had already entered the residence after shooting and injuring the police officers. Seeing the Prime Minister and his family members coming out, the perpetrators forced his family members to leave quickly to avoid disaster, and Inukai was knocked to the ground at this time. After the Prime Minister was attacked, he was carried to the Imperial University Hospital, and the police officer Tanaka Goro died at 9:00 PM due to serious injuries. Currently, all cabinet members are gathered at the Prime Minister's official residence for a meeting, and the residence is in great chaos. The vicinity of the residence is being guarded by a police team of about a hundred people, and no one other than cabinet members is allowed to enter or exit.</p>

<p>▲ Inspection of Zhabei: Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Zhabei inspectors appointed by the Takeover Committee, divided into public security and public utilities groups, including Xi Xikui, Huang Ming, Yin Tixin, Wu Shaolin, Han Tiexian, Jin Gong, Wang Guang, Xie Zhidao, Bao Ju, Dong Zhihe for the public security group, and Jin Zhu, Zhu Fuyi, Liang Sicheng, Deng Baocheng, Ma Chonggan, Zhu Shengjun, and Cha Nanqiang for the public utilities group. All members departed from the Joint Association, each member was first issued a map of Zhabei for takeover, and then divided into six cars, first went to Fengyang Pavilion on Xihua Road to meet with Colonel Kitaoka, the Japanese Navy Military Attaché, and then he sent personnel to accompany them to the Fifth Battalion headquarters of the Japanese Army on Xinmin Road, which is under the jurisdiction of the four districts, to contact Captain Katsuta, and first inspect the public institutions and the areas to be received. The captain sent an adjutant and a military policeman to accompany them to inspect the original site of the four-district police station on Gonghe Road, the current location of the Public Security Bureau training school. Three platoons of Japanese troops, totaling one hundred and fourteen, are stationed there and are preparing to withdraw. All the original equipment of the training school, important beds and tables, still exist, and electricity and tap water are available. In addition, the nearby houses are still completely undamaged. Next, they went to Xinmin Road to inspect the Zhabei Tax Collection Office of the Bureau of Finance. It was found that the Japanese army only had sentries guarding the place, and no troops were stationed inside. After the inspection, they went to Xinmin Road to inspect the Fire Brigade. It was found that there were still two fire trucks in the association, and copper hats and leather goods were stored upstairs. Finally, they patrolled the areas under the jurisdiction of the four districts and the first and second districts for a week. The houses of merchants were still intact, with little damage, and most residents were still in their old residences. Residents were consulted nearby, and they all said that the electricity and water were still used normally and were not damaged. At 11:30 AM, the inspectors returned to the Japanese Military Headquarters on Xinmin Road and were sent by the Japanese military officer to the Sanban Factory Bridge, and the entire team returned to the Joint Association at 12:00 AM. The Takeover Committee was then convened, chaired by Yin Rugeng, and the inspectors reported on their experiences. The specific policies for the construction and deployment of traffic arteries and agencies in Zhabei after the takeover were discussed based on the inspections. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.

<p>▲ Takeover Methods Today: Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the two groups of inspectors went to the Japanese Naval Marine Corps Headquarters on North Sichuan Road to meet with Major General Uematsu and Colonel Sugisaka to discuss the takeover procedures for the 16th. At that time, the following items were agreed upon between Inspector Gong of the Public Security Bureau and the Japanese side: (1) The Japanese side designated Captain Katsuta as the person in charge of the handover, (2) Our side designated Captain Huang of the Public Security Bureau as the person in charge of the takeover, (3) Koharada Takeo and Gong Xikui read the map of Zhabei together (Photo by Li Zunyong)</p>
<p>When the Japanese side hands over the receipt to our side, Dong will use the seal as proof. (4) When the Japanese side hands over the receipt to our side, the military and police will salute each other. (5) At 7:30 AM on the 16th, Captain Huang of the Public Security Bureau will lead 250 police officers from Hengfeng Bridge via Hengfeng Road to the original site of the Four Districts General Office on Gonghe Road, in front of the Public Security Bureau training school, and first take over the important positions. After 8:00 AM, the Japanese army will completely withdraw, and then deploy other positions. (6) The handover personnel of both sides will gather under the Fifth Battalion building of the Japanese Army on Xinmin Road at 9:00 AM on the 16th, and the Japanese side will prepare a complete list of documents, and the Chinese side will seal and inspect the receipt. The Japanese side will be attended by Major General Uematsu, and our side will be attended by Committee Member Wen. In addition, in accordance with Article 4 of the Sino-Japanese Armistice and Troop Withdrawal Agreement, the Joint Committee entrusted military officers from the United States, Britain, France, and Italy to monitor the scene.</p>
<p>▲ Extending the Curfew Time: After the Japanese army completely withdrew at 8:00 AM this morning, our police will take over the defense. It was decided by the Public Security Group of the Takeover Committee yesterday that after the takeover of the Zhabei area, the curfew time will be extended to 6:30 PM (the Japanese army's curfew was 5:30 PM). As for the Zhabei office of the Public Utilities and Finance Bureau on Minli Road, they will also go to take over at 8:00 AM this morning. Regarding the schools in the takeover area, there are a total of twenty-two schools, including the Municipal Yongxing, Xinmin, and Sanyu primary and secondary schools. The Education Bureau will send special personnel with the school authorities to take over at 8:00 AM this morning. In addition, the Municipal Education Bureau will continue to register schools in the war zone in the bureau for two days from today, so that when each district is scheduled to take over, the school authorities will be notified to go.</p>
<p>▲ Tomorrow's Takeover of Dachang: The Takeover Committee ordered Lu Fengpu, the second district chief of Baoshan County, and special commissioner Tao Xiaojie, to go to Dachang on the morning of the 16th to contact the Japanese garrison captain regarding the takeover. It also ordered Bian Zhishan, the captain of the Capital Security Force, to transfer a squad of police soldiers to be led by District Chief Lu Fengpu and Special Commissioner Tao Xiaojie to go to Dachang on the 17th to take over the town.</p>
<p>▲ Zhabei Japanese Military Office Abolished: The Japanese newspaper Shanghai Daily reported that the Zhabei Office of the Marine Corps attached to the Xinmin Road Elementary School will be abolished as of the 14th. All affairs during the withdrawal period of all the Marine Corps will be handled by the Zhabei Headquarters of the Garrison Brigade.</p>
<p>▲ Shirakawa's Last Instructions: The Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported that the Shanghai Expeditionary Force has been ordered to continue returning to the country. On the 14th, Commander Shirakawa issued the final withdrawal instructions to the entire army.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Inspection Notes</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Army Actively Dismantling Defensive Works</p>
<p>▲ Trenches and Bunkers Mostly Destroyed: The Guowen News Agency reported that after the signing of the Sino-Japanese agreement, the Japanese side ordered the withdrawal of the front-line garrison, starting today, and the return of a small part of Zhabei, south of the railway, north of the Suzhou River, east of the Guangzhao Villa, and west of North Zhejiang Road, to our side for takeover. The reporter went to the above-mentioned places yesterday for inspection, which lasted two hours. The observations are as follows.</p>
<h2>Page 3</h2>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>▲ Dismantling of Defensive Works by Japanese Army: The Japanese Marine Corps stationed south of the Zhabei Railway, after receiving orders from their superiors, prepared to withdraw and removed defensive materials such as barbed wire and electric fences from the fortress. The reporter passed along the north bank of the Suzhou River on Xinjiang Road, etc., and saw groups of three to five Marine Corps soldiers working extremely busily.</p>
<p>▲ Destruction of Trenches, Bunkers, and Mounds: After the Japanese army invaded our first line of defense, fearing a counterattack by the 19th Route Army, the construction of rear defensive works was extremely solid. In addition to trenches dug everywhere, large and small artillery positions were set up in important areas. The Japanese army originally built bunkers near the Taitong Road Sun Temple and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant. These places will be returned to our side today. According to nearby residents, the Japanese army removed the artillery a few days ago and destroyed the mounds themselves. The reporter inspected it for a long time, but could not discern its structural methods. The battle lines, such as traffic, etc., were also destroyed.</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of the Japanese Army's Actions at the North Station: The reporter passed through various places, and the Japanese army was working busily. The Japanese army was organizing guns and equipment in the undamaged engine room of the North Station. Tents were set up on the train platform, and military supplies were piled up on the tracks except for livestock. Chinese people were still not allowed to walk. The vicinity of the station was still heavily guarded. Except for a few coolies and rickshaw drivers, there were few pedestrians.</p>
<h3>Copy of the Ceasefire Agreement</h3>
<p>▲Awaiting Instructions from the Japanese Side ▲No Intention of Not Signing</p>
<p>Copy of the Sino-Japanese Ceasefire Agreement: Due to both sides considering the translated wording inappropriate, repeated consultations have been ongoing, delaying the signing until now, with no definite date set. Yesterday, a telegram from Nanjing stated that the Chinese and Japanese originals of the agreement would likely not be signed due to difficulties in discussing the translation. However, when the reporter inquired about this with Zhang Sixu, the Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who had previously handled the matter, he stated that there was no intention of not signing the agreement and that there was no such news from the capital. As for when the signing could take place, they were currently only awaiting instructions from the Japanese side. The Chinese version had already been fully resolved, with only two points remaining unresolved in the Japanese version. If the Japanese side could agree to accept them, the agreement could be signed immediately. Furthermore, according to the opinion of those familiar with Sino-Japanese diplomatic affairs, if the copy of the agreement is further delayed and remains unresolved, it is feared that it will inevitably result in no signing after all.

<h3>Gradual Resumption of Passenger Trains</h3>
<p>▲Temporary Local Trains Between Suzhou and Nanxiang Resume Yesterday</p>
<p>Passenger trains on the Jinghu Railway, after the outbreak of the war, changed from their usual state. Except for most local trains and express/slow trains being temporarily suspended, only the 11th and 13th (upbound) and 14th and 20th (downbound) passenger trains were running between Nanjing and Suzhou. In addition, a mixed passenger train was running once a day between Suzhou and Kunshan to facilitate travel. Now, with the successful trial run the day before, the Railway Traffic Department, Dispatching Section, and Locomotive Section consulted and decided to change the passenger train schedule starting yesterday to signal the gradual resumption of passenger trains. The origin and destination stations and schedules of the changed passenger trains are recorded below: (1) The original 11th and 13th (upbound) and 14th and 20th (downbound) passenger trains between Beijing and Suzhou will be extended to Kunshan and renamed Beijing-Kunshan trains, with the same times as the pre-war timetable. (2) The current mixed passenger train running between Suzhou and Kunshan will be canceled. (3) Temporary local trains will be added daily between Suzhou and Nanxiang, with two round trips each day. Each train will stop at all stations and will have first, second, and third-class carriages. (A) Depart Suzhou at 6:15 AM, arrive Nanxiang at 8:57 AM. (B) Depart Suzhou at 2:45 PM, arrive Nanxiang at 5:00 PM. (C) Depart Nanxiang at 9:10 AM, arrive Suzhou at 12:25 PM. (D) Depart Nanxiang at 5:15 PM, arrive Suzhou at 7:35 PM. All of the above took effect yesterday (the 15th).</p>
<p>▲Supervising the Repair of Telephone and Telegraph Lines</p>
<p>The telegraph, telephone, electrical lines, and signals east of Kunshan Station on the railway were completely destroyed. Now, they are being repaired section by section, so it is urgent to complete the repairs to facilitate train operation and avoid danger. In recent days, Zhou Jiayin, an electrical engineer from the railway, has been supervising the work, starting from Kunshan and repairing section by section. Yesterday, it was learned that telephone and telegraph lines had been repaired to Anting, and electrical signals had been repaired to Tianfu'an. It is expected that the area west of Nanxiang can be completely restored to its original state before last night. However, because the station building at Huangdu Station was destroyed, there is no way to set up any telecommunications there, so no telecommunications traffic will be established for the time being, and it will be set up again when the station building is restored in the future.</p>
<p>▲Expediting the Repair of Bridges and Tracks</p>
<p>Bridge No. 15 east of Nanxiang Station was bombed and destroyed by enemy aircraft on February 24, and the damage was more severe than that of the bridges between Shanghai and Nanxiang. The Engineering Department is now supervising the urgent repair. If there are no obstacles, it can be repaired within a few days. In addition, there are many bomb craters on the tracks and on both sides near Nanxiang Station, which has loosened the surrounding soil, making driving through it very dangerous. The Engineering Department is currently filling them in. Yin Zhilu, an engineer from the Zhenjiang section, has been ordered to temporarily reside in Huangdu to supervise the repair of the tracks at any time.</p>
<p>▲Negotiating the Return of the North Station</p>
<p>Regarding the North Station site of the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Bureau, it was previously scheduled that the Japanese soldiers would withdraw today. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, our side, led by the receiving committee, along with the Bureau Director Chen Xinghan, the car yard inspector Jin Zhu, the secretary, and others, went to the North Station and directly met with Japanese officers. After a negotiation, the Japanese side stated that the Japanese troops in the Zhenru area had not completely withdrawn and should not be completely returned. They returned a portion of the railway property west of Early Bridge, and the rest would be returned to the Railway Bureau after the Japanese troops withdrew from Zhenru. It has not yet been approved by the Japanese army and will not be received for the time being. Shanghai Telephone Bureau</p>
<h3>Receiving Branch Offices This Morning</h3>
<p>▲Actively Repairing Telephone Equipment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau, with the decision to receive Zhabei today, also plans to receive the first and second branch offices at the same time in order to repair the lines there as soon as possible. The details of the bureau's preparations are listed below:</p>
<p>▲Receiving the First and Second Branch Offices</p>
<p>According to an investigation report by the bureau, the first and second branch offices in Zhabei have not been destroyed. Therefore, the bureau, following the resolution of the Takeover Committee, has scheduled personnel to be officially dispatched at 9:00 AM today (the 16th) to receive the first and second branch offices on Gonghe Xin Road and Dongbaoxing Road in Zhabei.</p>
<p>▲Engineering Team Dispatched for Repairs</p>
<p>Huang Xiwu, the chief engineer of the bureau, told a National News Agency reporter that they are now dividing into seven engineering teams to repair the important telephones in various locations first. Although the switchboards (i.e., switchgear) of the first and second branch offices in Zhabei have not been significantly damaged, they still need to be repaired after the takeover. Many parts on the switchboards are missing and need to be replaced.</p>
<p>▲Summoning Original Operators</p>
<p>The bureau's original operators (i.e., switchboard operators) fled from Zhabei during the intense fighting in Shanghai. Because the bureau's funds were stretched, they have all been dismissed. Now, they have been notified to summon the original operators back to the bureau to serve, so they can use their experience.</p>
<p>▲Prior Notification Required for Users</p>
<p>For the phone lines of original users, they must be verified after the bureau takes over to find out the damage. If users urgently need to make calls, please notify the bureau at any time so that craftsmen can be dispatched for repairs as soon as possible. However, the Police Training Institute and Public Security Bureau will be repaired first.</p>

<p>Recently Received by the League of Nations</p>
<p>Content of Sino-Japanese Official Documents</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Chinese delegation presented a copy of a telegram from Nanjing to the League of Nations authorities, stating that Japan is using the Manchurian puppet government to continue to provoke in Shanhaiguan. The telegram stated that in recent days, Japanese troops have repeatedly fired cannons and rifles at Shanhaiguan in order to disrupt security in the area. The telegram also reiterated Ma Zhanshan's report that Japanese troops entering Dunhua had burned all the houses, plundered all the food, disarmed the police, and arrested the county magistrate, imprisoning him on a gunboat. Many refugee women were stabbed to death by Japanese bayonets. Civilians who took refuge in caves were sealed in and burned alive, resulting in a tragic death toll. The Chinese delegation stated that this kind of cruel behavior is against humanity. The Japanese side also submitted an official document titled (The Banditry in Manchuria) to the League of Nations. The document stated that from March 1st to 10th, there were 574 robbery cases near the South Manchuria Railway. From March 11th to 20th, there were 417 attacks. From March 21st to 31st, there were 612 attacks. From April 1st to 10th, there were 539 attacks. Among them, 581 attacks were carried out by teams of more than 200 people. A total of 34 people were killed and 626 people were taken hostage. The Japanese official document also stated that the former Manchurian officials have now begun to resume their activities, so the disturbances have increased sharply, especially after the League of Nations delegation entered Manchuria. It has also been discovered that Zhang Xueliang recently issued a large number of counterfeit silver dollar notes. Xian Dianzhong has been exclusively in charge of suppressing bandits since the end of March, and Zhang Haipeng's troops are responsible for suppressing bandits on the Tao'ang line. There are now eight regiments of Manchurian troops fighting against the disturbances caused by Zhang Xueliang in the Dunhua area. Furthermore, there are disturbances in Rehe against the Manchurian government. Finally, it stated that Japanese people residing in the Beihe area have now entered Soviet Russia for temporary refuge.

<h3>The Future of Russian-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today's Izvestia published an article by Laiter on Russian-Japanese relations, which stated that judging from the recent political views published by Tanaka and Doi Hara in the Japan Times, and the discussion of Tanaka's political views in Japanese newspapers, it is enough to prove that the ideal of occupying Manchuria and driving straight in, and the eager welcome of Japan's occupation of Manchuria, have now been replaced by the realization that the occupation of Manchuria will take time and effort. We now feel that some people in Japan estimate the military situation in Manchuria and have become greatly sobered. However, the leaders of various Japanese circles or the press have not yet expressed this new argument. After Laiter criticized the views of the Japanese newspapers, he rejoiced in the new signs of Japanese policy, and said, I don't know whether this new sign is only the will of diplomats, or whether the military also has the same sentiment. Laiter concluded that if we want to eliminate the rift in Russian-Japanese relations, we should conclude a non-aggression agreement. (15th Reuters) Central Planning</p>

<h3>Telegraphs the League of Nations Administrative Council</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Business Community National Salvation Association telegraphed the League of Nations Administrative Council and Representative Gu on the 15th, stating that the violent Japanese occupied our territory in the three eastern provinces, invaded Shanghai, slaughtered and looted, acted wildly, disregarded public justice and humanitarianism, and regarded the League of Nations resolutions as useless. The Shanghai peace talks had just been concluded, and the warning of Yuguan had arrived again, actively increasing troops, building trenches, distributing sentries, arbitrarily firing guns, and firing cannons, provoking our garrison, plotting to develop into the interior. Now that the investigation team is still in Jilin and Heilongjiang, the Japanese army has been rampaging unbridled. If the League of Nations does not impose appropriate sanctions, the peace in the Far East will not be guaranteed, and all countries in the world will suffer. At the same time, it also telegraphed the National Government, urging it to make a major plan to recover the lost land by force. (15th Dispatch) Guangdong Troops Leaving the Province</p>

<h3>Far East War Crisis Imminent</h3>
<p>Chairman of the Russian People's Committee Declares: If Unfortunately War Should Break Out, The Entire Red Army is Prepared to Deal With It ▲ National News Agency, Moscow, 14th The hope that the situation in the Far East has eased slightly and that the crisis of war has passed has been dashed today by a speech by Molotov (i.e., Prime Minister), Chairman of the Soviet Russian People's Committee. Molotov declared that the crisis of war is growing daily, and that in order to disrupt the construction of Soviet Russia, preparations for war are becoming more urgent. However, although Soviet Russia is in this environment, it will still strive to avoid war. If unfortunately war should break out, it is deeply believed that every member of our Red Army will do their duty and establish extraordinary achievements.</p>
<h3>Japanese Securities Decline</h3>
<p>The Seiyukai is Powerless to Reverse the Crisis ▲ China United News Agency, Tokyo, 14th According to a survey by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the total value of Japanese securities on May 1 was 12.947 billion yuan, of which the market value of stocks was 10.812 billion yuan and public bonds were 2.112 billion yuan. Compared with the same day last month, this is a decrease of 389 million yuan. Compared with when the Seiyukai first formed the cabinet, the decrease is 1.089 billion yuan, which proves that the Seiyukai's active policies have had no effect whatsoever on reversing Japan's financial situation.

<h3>Also Issues Domestic Debt</h3>
<p>Affected by the Global Economic Downturn ▲ National News Agency, Paris, 14th Although France's gold reserves are second only to the United States in the world, the global economic downturn has affected even prosperous France. According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Finance today, it has had to issue short-term treasury bills worth 30 billion francs to make up for the treasury deficit. Two years ago, France's treasury reserves still had 190 billion francs, but now not only has it all been used up, but it is also necessary to borrow money to make up for the deficit, which shows the severity of the global economic depression.

<h3>Goguloff Pre-Trial</h3>
<p>Confronted with Four Witnesses in Court The Name is False and Still Under Investigation ▲ Havas, Paris, 14th The pre-trial judge handling the Goguloff case questioned four witnesses today and confronted them with the assassin. One witness, named Astagov, came to Paris specifically to prove that the assassin's name is false. He said that he knew the real Goguloff very well and that he was killed in a riot in 1918. When he was confronted with the assassin, Astagov testified that the assassin's name was Alexei, surnamed Chalotarev, and that he knew him when he was young. He also said that Chalotarev was injured by an iron rod when he was young. The court will investigate the witness's testimony. When asked, the assassin said, "(The witness is either an agent provocateur or a madman or a drunkard)." Goguloff's account of his experiences during the European War, after the first investigation, appears to be true. Another witness, an antique dealer in a street near the sniper site, testified that he saw Goguloff talking to a man and a Slavic young woman for several minutes before the sniper attack. The assassin denied this.</p>

<h3>Will Change Attitude Towards Japan</h3>
<p>▲ Japan Fears that France will Change its Pro-Japanese Policy ▲ Will Become the Leader of Anti-Japanese Small Countries in the League of Nations ▲ It is Expected that Major Waves will Arise in the Manchurian Question The Osaka Asahi Shimbun says that as a result of the second round of voting in the French general election, the various factions of the Left Party occupy an absolute majority. The alliance of the Left Party is even stronger than in the 1924 general election. Therefore, the Taidiou cabinet will naturally collapse. The Left Party now has three-fifths of the seats in the lower house, and the right to govern will naturally belong to Herriot's Radical Party. Therefore, Japan will be greatly affected. Herriot has often attacked Japan's actions in the Sino-Japanese dispute, denouncing Japan for trampling on the League of Nations and violating the Non-Aggression Pact. In the past, the small countries in the League of Nations that launched anti-Japanese campaigns were still pro-Japanese. Now that the Left Party has won a major victory, they will surely lead the small countries in opposing Japan, and France will become the leader of the anti-Japanese small countries. It is expected that major waves will arise in the Manchurian question in the future. Japan's Response to Manchuria</p>
<h3>Advocates Acting Unilaterally</h3>
<p>▲ Secretary-General Mori Makes Grand Declarations ▲ Says Treaties are a Mere Scrap of Paper The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun says that Cabinet Secretary-General Mori (i.e., Chief Secretary) has made a major statement on the Manchurian question, stating in brief that Manchuria is currently at the crossroads of world diplomacy, and that our people should be doubly determined to resolve the Manchurian question in the future. In the past, our diplomacy has been subject to the whims of the League of Nations, which is a state without control, and the power of the great powers, looking left and right, has used the sanctity of the League of Nations and the beautiful name of the Non-Aggression Pact to deceive the world. Today, we must adopt a unilateral attitude towards Manchuria, the lifeline of our country. All kinds of treaties and agreements are merely to maintain the status quo of a few powerful countries in the world, and are in fact a mere scrap of paper. How can this kind of empty document prohibit war? In this international situation, in order to ensure the position and rights of the Empire, we can no longer consider the attitude of other countries, but only deal with it by means of independent and unilateral action.

<h3>US Consulate Set on Fire</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Fear that a Major International Problem Will Occur The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun says that a fire broke out at the US Consulate in Oura-cho, Nagasaki City, at 11:00 a.m. on the 9th, fortunately without causing a major disaster. At that time, the Umezakigasaki Police Station dispatched more than a dozen officers to the scene of the fire, along with Judge Kobayashi of the Nagasaki District Court and Prosecutor Murakami of the Prosecutor's Office, tightly closed the gate, and conducted a serious search. The perpetrator had already escaped. Fragments of kerosene and gasoline bottles were found, and it was determined that it was undoubtedly arson. This matter is feared to cause a major international problem, and various parties are secretly discussing it. Guangdong Province</p>
<h3>Military Action About to be Launched</h3>
<p>▲ Chen Jitang Had Long Planned to Unify Military Power ▲ Military Plan Takes a Defensive Posture Towards the Central Government for the Time Being ▲ Determined to Send Troops to Attack Chen Ce and Zhang Huichang ▲ But the Attitude of Guangxi Province Towards Guangdong is Still Questionable Guangzhou Correspondence: Chen Jitang's resolute handling of the navy and air force this time was determined long before the Battle of Shanghai. During the stalemate in the Shanghai battle, Chen Jitang regarded Huang Shaoxiong's return to Guangxi, He Yingqin's entry into Jiangxi, and the transfer of Sun Lianzhong's troops to eastern Jiangxi as moves by the Central Government to prepare for Guangdong, so he actively prepared for war. Under the pretext of resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists, he sent Yu Hanmou to lead the First Army to occupy southern Jiangxi, sent Li Yangjing to lead the Third Army to garrison Chaozhou and Meizhou, and sent the Second Army to defend the northeast to support the Jiangxi-Fujian border. For the navy and air force, he first sent the Fifth Division to take over Humen as the first step in controlling the navy, and then divided the air force internally to abolish the Air Force Headquarters. After the Shanghai armistice agreement was officially signed, Chen formally revealed his true colors. The first step was to have Central Committee member Xiao Focheng send a telegram to Lin Sen and Wang Jingwei, questioning the error of Guangdong's signing of the agreement with Japan. On the 8th, the Guangdong Provincial Party Department and the Guangzhou City Party Department jointly sent a telegram, denouncing the armistice agreement for betraying national sovereignty and humiliating the country. On the 9th, Central Executive Committee members staying in Guangdong, Xiao Focheng, Tang Shaoyi, Deng Zeru, Zou Lu, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Lin Yunhai, Bai Chongxi, Lin Zhimian, Huang Xuchu, Liu Jiwen, Deng Qingyang, Lin Yizhong, Cheng Tiangu, Xiang Hanping, Ou Fangpu, Chen Yaoyuan, Li Yangjing, Li Qigan, Miao Peinan, Yu Hanmou, Zhan Jusi, Guan Suren, and others jointly sent a telegram opposing the armistice agreement. As for future military action, it is reported that Chen Jitang has determined that if the Central Army does not advance on the border of Guangdong, the Guangdong Army will first take a defensive posture to eliminate internal troubles, and then seek progress. Although Chen has taken over the navy and air force this time, he has only taken over a part in reality. The air force has always been divided into two factions. Although Huang Guangrui's troops have complied, the aircraft under the command of the Zhongshan faction (i.e., Zhang Huichang's faction) have already flown to Zhongshan and Qiongya. On the 6th, more than 20 aircraft secretly went to Qiongya for concentration. As for the naval fleet, only more than 20 inland river fleet ships have been recovered in recent days. The remaining seagoing ships have sailed to Tangjia Bay. After Chen Ce went to Tangjia Bay to encourage the captains, the Zhongshan, Flying Eagle, Fu'an, and Hairui ships successively sailed from Tangjia Bay to Qiongzhou. Chen Ce then went to Hong Kong to secretly discuss with Zhang Huichang, and decided that the navy and air force would unanimously oppose Chen Jitang, and decided that the anti-Chen navy and air force would unite in Qiongzhou. A naval headquarters was established in Haikou, and Chen Qingyun and the chief of the naval secretariat and more than a dozen others were sent on the Tokyo round to Haikou, Qiongzhou, to preside over naval affairs, and to direct the deployment of various fleets and air forces. For the time being, under the name of the Qiongya Special District, they will support the Central Government and separate from the administrative relationship of Guangdong Province. Qiongya has 13 counties, and the income from taxes is sufficient to cover the expenses of the navy and air force. Since Qiongya is virtually independent, this is a cause of internal concern for Guangdong Chen, and he must resolve it as soon as possible. In recent days, in addition to urgently ordering Liang Guowu's troops, who are suppressing bandits in Xuwen County, to move nearby to monitor Qiong, he has also prepared to continue to send large troops to besiege. On the 10th of this month, more than 20 people claiming to be representatives of Qiongya went to the headquarters of the First Group Army to petition Chen to send troops to Qiong to suppress bandits. Chen has accepted the petition and said that it would be submitted to the Southwest Political Affairs Council for approval during the day, and then troops could be sent. According to this, the Qiongya war will break out sooner or later. As for the attitude of Guangxi Province towards Guangdong, it is also questionable. Some say that it is consistent with Guangdong, and Li Zongren hurried back to Guangxi a few days ago to make arrangements. Others say that Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi held an important meeting in Nanning recently, and seemed to be taking monitoring measures against Guangdong. Both theories have not been confirmed. However, Chen Ce and Zhang Huichang have recently sent trusted representatives to Nanning to make contact, and Chen Jitang has also suddenly transferred Liu Qishi's troops, the Fourth Independent Regiment stationed in Gaolei, to Xijiang, Zhaoqing for defense, and Ye Minyu's troops, the Second Army Training Regiment, from Jiangmen to Xinxing, with a strong defensive attitude towards Guangxi. Therefore, the separation and combination of Guangxi and Guangdong is also the most noteworthy issue at present. (May 11) Hebei Province</p>
<h3>After the Public Sale of Opium</h3>
<p>▲ The Daily Income Between Beijing and Tianjin is More Than 40,000 to 50,000 Yuan ▲ The Daily Income Between Rehe and Beijing is About 120,000 Yuan ▲ The National Anti-Drug Association Repeatedly Opposes it in Vain ▲ Zhang Xueliang Replied by Telegram Saying There is No Relaxation of the Opium Ban Tianjin Special Correspondence: Hebei Province has implemented opium destruction certificates, and the process has been recorded in this newspaper. According to insiders, the sales are extremely developed. In the initial estimate of the organizers, the monthly income would be no more than one million yuan, and after deducting all expenses, only 500,000 to 600,000 yuan would be earned. Now, from Beijing to Tianjin, the average daily income is more than 50,000 yuan, and from Rehe to Beijing, the daily income is 120,000 yuan. In these two places alone, the monthly income has reached 5 million yuan, which is beyond the initial estimate. There are two types of raw opium transported from Rehe to Beijing: one type weighs 20 taels per package and has a destruction certificate of 14 yuan, and the other type weighs 50 taels per package and has a destruction certificate of 28 yuan and 8 jiao. The opium from Rehe to Tianjin is the same as that to Beijing. From Beijing to Tianjin, each package weighing 20 taels has a certificate of 2 yuan and 4 jiao, and each package weighing 50 taels has a certificate of 6 yuan. When the opium arrives in Tianjin, it is unloaded from the "righteous dumping" cars of the Qingfeng Flour Mill on the Dao Yi Road of the East Station and loaded into trucks, which go around the railway walls to the Northern Company in the Special Second District for storage. (It is necessary to go around the railway walls because the outside of the railway walls is the Italian Concession.) Previously, a batch of 60,000 taels of opium was seized by the Italian Concession, but the Italian Engineering Bureau claimed that only 30,000 taels were seized. After repeated negotiations, a fine of 10,000 yuan was agreed upon, and it was released yesterday. Since the implementation of the destruction certificate, smuggled opium has disappeared because official opium is abundant and smuggled opium is more expensive than official opium due to the high cost of movement. Therefore, the major opium dealers in the Japanese Concession have abandoned smuggled opium and switched to selling official opium. The news media in Beijing have been warned by the local authorities not to publish news about destruction certificates. The news media in Tianjin only published news without criticism in the past, but recently they only criticize without publishing news. However, the North China Star and the Times (both English newspapers) have been publishing extensively. The Times even published an editorial, severely criticizing it. The Chinese authorities can do nothing but listen. The Hebei Provincial National Anti-Drug Association sent a telegram to Zhang Xueliang, opposing the opening of the opium ban. Zhang replied in a light tone, saying that it was a rumor and that there was no such thing. Recently, the association submitted a cloth bag containing opium with a destruction certificate and telegraphed Zhang to severely punish the organizers. Three days after the telegram was sent, there was still no reply. The original text of the association's telegram to Zhang is recorded below. (To Director Zhang of the Pacification Headquarters in Beiping, Zhang Junjian, in the reply received in winter, it was stated that the saying of regular public sale is a rumor and there is no such thing, etc., which shows the importance of saving the country and the comfort of those who are admired. However, according to investigations in recent days, destruction certificates for disguised public sales of previous rumors have still been found. According to Jun's telegram, it is obviously a private counterfeit and is definitely not approved by the official office. Considering that foreign insults are imminent and the country is shocked, all Chinese people should strive to be enterprising and thoroughly wash away the old filth to wash away the great humiliation after the Opium War. Unexpectedly, one or two profiteers dare to deceive Zunting and take risks. Because of private convenience, they will harm the country. The risk of collapse can be feared. The harm of phase rights, silence and uneasiness, I respectfully submit a bag containing soldiers, and one destruction certificate each in purple and green. I beg you to check and ban it, and at the same time severely punish the organizers in accordance with the anti-opium regulations promulgated by the Central Government and Hebei Province, to comfort public opinion and to fulfill the purpose of your seat's strict prohibition. To the utmost of panic and waiting for orders, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial National Anti-Drug Association, Cao Hongzhu, respectfully seals the true seal), It is also heard that the Tianjin Municipal Party Affairs Rectification Committee has conducted a detailed investigation and collected evidence, and requested the Central Government to order an investigation. Party rectification committee members Shao Hua, Liu Chenzhang, and Shi Zizhou have been summoned to Beijing by the Central Government to inquire about everything. The destruction certificates are colorful and look like commemorative stamps at first glance.

<h3>Zhengyang Suddenly Captured by Bandits</h3>
<p>▲ Shouxian is Also Extremely Critical Bengbu Correspondence: Since the accumulated bandits in the Henan-Anhui border area invaded Liu'an, the situation in western Anhui has become increasingly tense. Chen Tiaoyuan, the commander-in-chief of the First Route, came to Hefei to supervise the suppression. Knowing that it would be difficult to resist, the bandits disturbed the front line with small groups, and transferred the most vicious bandits to disrupt the Changhuai area with the trick of avoiding the real and attacking the weak. They captured Zhengyangguan on the morning of the 12th. Zhengyang is a large town southwest of Shouxian, located on the south bank of the Huai River and the east bank of the Pei River. It is commercially prosperous. A few days ago, Matouji, Yinxianji, and Yingheji, southwest of Zhengyang, fell one after another. On the eve of the fall of Zhengyang (11th), suddenly many civilian ships claiming to be refugees came to the river under Zhengyangguan, hiding weapons and hoping to take the opportunity to riot. The local group police did not pay attention. The next morning, the group police arrested a suspicious bandit scout on the street and found a bomb in his bag. They took him to the bureau for interrogation. While he was being interrogated, gunshots suddenly rang out from all directions, and the bandits had entered the main street. The group police went out to fight the bandits in the alley, but because there were too few people, they were outnumbered, and the bandits swept with hand-held machine guns, gathering more and more people. They also raised red flags. At 8 a.m., the city was captured by the bandits. The bandits seized many branches of the water police guns and occupied various institutions. The militia retreated to the east. Niu Youchen, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, was unable to escape and was captured by the bandits. Ordinary people fled to Shouxian and Bengbu. Many refugees have fled from Zhengyang in recent days and have gathered in the river. Since Zhengyang has fallen, Shouxian is also in danger, because Shouxian is only sixty miles away, arriving in the evening if starting in the morning. People are extremely panicked. The local public groups in the county sent telegrams to Beijing and Bengbu, asking for troops to rescue. Peng Zhuoru, a fellow villager in Bengbu, telegraphed, (To all gentlemen of the Zhenwu branch, Peng Zhuoru turns to all fellow villagers, Zhengyang has fallen, and it is approaching 30 Lipu, the county town is in critical condition, please cry to the military officers stationed in Bengbu and ask them to send a team to come to the rescue at night, all the public groups and all the people of Shouxian kowtow), Zhu Dexin, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, telegraphed the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce, (To Peng Zhuoru of the Chamber of Commerce, Zhengyang has fallen, Shouxian is extremely dangerous, please quickly ask for troops to come to the rescue, Dexin kowtows), The Chamber of Commerce here, according to reports, immediately telegraphed the Nanjing National Government, the Military Affairs Commission, the Anqing Provincial Government, and Chen Tiaoyuan in Hefei for assistance, saying, (According to a telegram from Shouxian, Zhengyang has been lost and Shouxian city is in critical condition, please quickly ask for military assistance to rescue, etc., please send a large army to suppress and save the crisis and ensure the safety of northern Anhui, I am urgently waiting for orders, the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce kowtows), It was recently heard that the Central Government has sent two elite divisions to Bengbu to suppress the bandits. However, on the evening of the 12th, the telegraph lines between Bengbu and Shouxian suddenly broke, and telegrams were not possible. The news was cut off and the truth was unknown. It is said that Shouxian was surrounded by bandits, and another said that it had already been lost. Today (13th), the telegrams from Bengbu to Fengtai are also not possible, so the situation in Shouxian is even more difficult to understand. According to the refugees, bandits have also been found in Yaojiawan (commonly known as Shangyao), which borders Fengtai and Huaiyuan and is near the Huai River, intercepting refugees. Therefore, ships sailing from Bengbu only reach near Xijin, Huaiyuan, and cannot go any further. The authorities here, considering the tense situation in the upper reaches of the Changhuai River, have ordered the military and police to be on strict alert. At 2 p.m. today, senior military and police officers gathered at the headquarters of the 12th Division for a meeting to discuss defense, suppression, and maintaining security. As for the Bengbu area, it is as peaceful as usual. (13th) Fujian Province</p>

<h3>Military Expansion by Various Armies</h3>
<p>▲But there is still no progress in suppressing bandits. Fuzhou correspondence: The two divisions of the Guangdong Army aiding Fujian, led by Huang Renhuan and Huang Yanzhen, were ordered to temporarily halt their advance due to changes in the Guangdong situation. However, they continue to hold the three counties on the Fujian border: Wuping, Shanghang, and Yongding. Li Yangjing appointed Wen Chongyuan as the magistrate of Shanghang County, Ouyang Xin as the magistrate of Wuping County, and Hu Daonan as the magistrate of Yongding County (all local people) to handle local rehabilitation. The troops under Zhang Zhen of the 49th Division are currently stationed in Yunxiao and Zhao'an, as well as Changtai and Tong'an counties. The troops in Yunxiao and Zhao'an counties are under the command of Zhang Zhen himself, while the troops in Changtai and Tong'an counties are under the command of Chief of Staff Han Huirong. A Tongtai Communist Suppression Command Post was established in Tong'an, with Han appointed as the commander. Soldiers scattered in the Zhanglong battles have been collected over the past half-month, and the number of returnees has reached 10,000, divided into six regiments, plus one battalion each of artillery, engineers, and supply troops, with Huang Kesheng, Ruan Baoyu, Hong Zhangshi, Lin Qinglong, and Zhu Xiping as regimental commanders, Huang Yan as artillery battalion commander, Ye Jinsha as engineer battalion commander, and Wang Zhennan as supply battalion commander. Reorganization is nearing completion. Chen Guohui, the first brigade commander of the Provincial Defense Army stationed in Quanzhou, came to the province by plane on the morning of the 8th of this month to report on the defense between Quanzhou and Tong'an. He claimed that it was extremely solid and that the Red bandits would never be able to invade. He is scheduled to return to his post on the 11th. In addition, the Guarantee Case Office recently appointed Gao Yi, the former brigade commander of the newly編軍, as the Tingzhanglong Bandit Suppression Guerrilla Commander, collecting scattered soldiers from the militia in western Fujian and reorganizing them into bandit suppression guerrilla teams to assist regular troops in combat. At the same time, the Navy Department also appointed Lin Shouguo, the former brigade commander of the Marine Corps, as the Commander of the Marine Corps Suppression of the Reds, transferring parts of the First and Second Brigades of the Marine Corps currently stationed in Fuzhou and Funing to be incorporated. The miscellaneous troops of Dai Qixiong and Lin Jizeng in Xianyou were also assigned to Lin's command, under the control of Chen Jiliang, the commander of the First Fleet stationed in Xiamen. However, Ma Hongxing's Sixth Brigade of the Newly编 Second Division, currently stationed in the front lines of Ninghua, Qingliu, and Guihua in northern Fujian, and in the Red bandit-infested Changting and Liancheng in western Fujian, harbors deep resentment towards Division Commander Lu Xingbang for his discriminatory intentions. He recently declared independence in 防次, which will inevitably affect the future of bandit suppression in western Fujian. (May 10) Local Communication</p>

<p>▲Telegraphic Request for Exemption from Continued Collection of House Rent Since the outbreak of the riots, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, due to insufficient funds and stalled collections, ordered all counties under its jurisdiction to collect two months' house rent uniformly and remit it to the province. This county is adjacent to Shanghai and greatly affected by the war, and the social economy is extremely panicked. Regarding the collection of house rent, it was initially planned to submit a petition to the province requesting exemption. Later, after earnest persuasion from the authorities, the people勉力 managed to pay. The first month's collection has been completed. Now, as the officialdom is about to continue collecting the second month's house rent, the merchants and people have requested Wang Feng to exempt them from collection. The County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the provincial government and the Department of Finance on a cold day, requesting that the second month's house rent be approved to be exempted by the county to cultivate vitality and follow public opinion.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>▲Request to Ban the Navigation Administration Inspection Office. The County Chamber of Commerce reported that the Suzhou Navigation Administration Bureau had set up inspection posts at Huguan, Fengmen, and other places without authorization, and hired patrol boats to patrol and search, acting like a likin station. Even small wood and rice transport boats under twenty tons were subject to extortion under the pretext of certificates. Dozens of ignorant farmers are deceived every day. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that inland river ships should be registered by the local government according to law.

<h3>National Compilation and Translation Bureau to be Established Soon</h3>
<p>▲Director Has Arrived in Beijing and Expressed His Views. Xin Shuzhi, Director of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau (formerly Director of the Compilation and Review Department of the Ministry of Education), returned to Beijing on the morning of the 3rd from Xi'an. A reporter specifically visited him and asked when the Compilation and Translation Bureau would be established. Xin replied that he had just returned today and would decide after meeting with Minister Zhu. Xin's plan is that because there are very few reference books above the middle school level, scholars feel extremely difficult. Therefore, the first step is to purchase basic science books and engage in compilation and translation to benefit scholars. Currently, he will use the entire 5,000 yuan of start-up funds to purchase them. After receiving more funding, he will continue to add to the compilation and translation. Thinking needs to be calm, so the second step is to choose a quiet and suitable location, first for the design, depending on the funding situation, or first build part of the house, as a place for special compilation and translation, and then add to it gradually according to the plan, to complete the entire plan. However, it is estimated that it will take more than a year to complete the construction of the bureau. Currently, he can still borrow the office of the Ministry of Education. Xin also said that in the autumn of national crisis and economic difficulties, he will do things realistically and never make false shows. Therefore, the first step for recruiting specialized talents is because specialized talents in various sciences are not all in the field, and many have already been recruited by universities. Therefore, the search must be very cautious,宁缺勿濫. Fortunately, he has been in contact with the specialized talents of various universities. When the funds cannot be fully received, he can temporarily entrust specialized talents to start compilation and translation. When the funds are abundant, he can proceed step by step and gradually move forward. When the Compilation and Review Department of the Ministry of Education is cancelled in the future, it will be merged into the Compilation and Translation Bureau and still handle the review of textbooks and books for primary and secondary schools. The nature of the Compilation and Translation Bureau and the Research Institute is different in that one compiles and translates suitable reading materials for general use, while the other specializes in the study of advanced books for the sake of developing talents.</p>

<h3>Requesting Aftercare for Martyred Members</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Incident, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scouts fully mobilized to serve in the war zone. A total of four members were killed and two were injured. Recently, due to the compromise of the peace agreement, all members have been withdrawn and are in the process of ending. The aftercare of the four martyred members is even more urgent. The group has planned to (1) console the bereaved families, (2) hold a regular funeral, (3) public burial and monument construction, (4) hold a memorial service, (5) publish a commemorative publication. The draft is presented to the Chamber of Commerce to forward to higher authorities. The original presentation is as follows: For the presentation of matters, since the outbreak of the January 28 Incident, this group has adhered to the original purpose of promoting the spirit of patriotism, love of the nation, love of mankind, and brave sacrifice among young people. Regardless of occupation and abandoning families, they devoted all their efforts to serving the war zone, sheltering refugees, rescuing wounded soldiers, braving the flames and enduring hunger and cold, lurking in deep ditches and trenches, entering and exiting gun forests and bullets. As a result, four members were killed and two were injured. However, they were still not afraid and continued to work hard, always following our loyal soldiers to enhance the long-term resistance with the spirit of military-civilian cooperation. This is all the effect of the leadership and support of钧会 since the establishment of this group, sparing no effort. Now that the war has ended and the service is about to end, among the many things to be dealt with, the aftercare of the four martyred members is the most urgent task at hand. The loyal souls cannot avoid the groans of the underground, and the bereaved families are in urgent need of comfort. Therefore, the西member aftercare notes are specially drafted and sent for review. We respectfully hope that you will observe their loyalty to the country and self-sacrifice to fulfill their obligations so that the dead can rest in peace and the living can be free from worry. Sincerely, the acting团长 Tian Minggao and Yu Guangxuan Ying Jing presented to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce钧鉴.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Education after January 28th (5) Shang</h3>
<p>▲Social Education Institutions Suffered Heavy Losses ｜The Ministry of Education Sent Personnel to Inspect</p>
<h3>7. Social Education Suffers</h3>
<p>In China, where illiteracy is rampant, social education is of utmost importance. Unfortunately, after the January 28th Incident, all municipal supplementary schools, two central schools and seventeen ordinary schools, were shut down. More than eight hundred and seventy students were left with no books to read. Of the more than three hundred private supplementary schools, with a total of fifteen thousand students, half also closed. The two municipal central public schools, six independent public schools, and forty-four affiliated public schools, with over two thousand students, were also all suspended. Of the more than thirty private public schools, fifteen were unable to sustain themselves and ceased instruction. The two municipal libraries had to temporarily close their doors. Of the more than thirty private libraries, those burned turned to dust, and those that survived were largely inaccessible. The mobile libraries operated by the municipal education bureau, two vehicles, were temporarily suspended. The mobile libraries operated by the municipal chamber of commerce have yet to be revived. In a nation like this, Shanghai actually managed to establish a (Municipal Science Laboratory), which truly required immense effort. This rare institution happened to be located at the intersection of Dixwell Road and Tiantong Road, the enemy's main base. As a result, the building was damaged, the instruments were destroyed, and the equipment was harmed. The director, Fan Fengyuan's, bedding and luggage disappeared without a trace, with losses of about four thousand yuan. However, compared to being reduced to rubble, the enemy treated the science laboratory much better. Shadow of the Oriental Library after the disaster</p>
<p>More seriously, at 8 Hongde Lane, Yokohama Road (Shanghai Martial Arts Research Association), all the buildings, instruments, books, documents and other properties were looted. That's not all; forty-eight members (about half of all members) are missing. Three members were beaten and injured all over. One servant was killed and his body was never found. Alas, nothing is more grievous than being a slave of a conquered nation. Now, the nation has not been conquered, but the grief is greater than being a slave of a conquered nation. I ask, what will compensate for this loss, this extreme humiliation? At the end of North Sichuan Road, the China Arts and Crafts Society is a well-known academic organization in the country. Most of its members are returned students from Japan. Since the September 18th Incident, they have been actively involved in national salvation work. The enemy hated them to the core. When the enemy invaded Shanghai this time, its Second Naval Command was located opposite the society. It is said that on January 29th, the enemy naval command sent naval officers and many ruffians to break into the building, search and destroy it, and then posted a seal of the enemy naval command on the gate and left. On February 22nd, when our army attacked the end of North Sichuan Road, the enemy army set fire to the society when retreating. It was found that the society had a large collection of specialized books, worth about more than two hundred thousand yuan. The specialized books deposited by the members were worth about one hundred thousand yuan. In addition, there were dozens of manuscripts of works submitted by members for publication. Furthermore, Ma Zongrong, the secretary of the society and a social education expert, had collected more than a thousand specialized books on social education over the past ten years, all of which were turned to ashes, truly another great loss to our nation's culture.</p>
<h3>8. Authorities Inspect</h3>
<p>In early March, the municipal education bureau began an investigation and sent special personnel to risk their lives to inspect the war zone to assess the damage in order to make proper arrangements for the aftermath. On the 26th of that month, two senior officials from the Ministry of Education, Advisor Chen Panzao and Section Chief Dai Yingguan, arrived in Shanghai from the capital via a detour to console the affected schools. They also spent more than ten days of valuable time with personnel from the municipal education bureau, treading on the post-war ruins to inspect the pitiful schools in distress. A friend of the reporter happened to be collecting materials that day and unexpectedly met them, so he followed them, wandering around and looking around. It is said that the devastated Wusong and Zhabei had become desolate and barren, and the breeze carried a bloody smell that made people tremble. Along the way, what caught the eye was nothing more than deep, dark holes, winding trenches, and exquisite foreign-style buildings, most of which were covered with the sun flag, allowing the arrogant soldiers of the imperial kingdom to sleep comfortably. Fortunately, Fudan University's buildings survived, and we were relieved and grateful. It is said that the women's dormitory had become the enemy soldiers' brothel, Zibin College was used as the command office, the gymnasium was converted into a stable, and the storage room, library, and Jian Gong Hall were used as ammunition depots, military hospitals, and supply depots. The Cultural College and Patriotic Girls' Middle School suffered the same fate. We wanted to go to Jiangwan Town but were blocked. We could not go forward, so we had to turn back. As a result of the inspection, we only saw completely destroyed schools such as Central University, Business College, Labor University, Chizhi College, and Shanghai Law College. Those not completely destroyed were the Labor University Agricultural College and Songbei Elementary School. Those that survived were Southeast Women's Physical Education Normal School, Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Normal School, Fudan University, Patriotic Girls' Middle School, Shanghai Cultural College, Rural Elementary School, and Yizhong Elementary School. It is hoped that after the Ministry of Education's inspection, they will have a clear plan on how to restore and expand Shanghai's education in the future, so that there will be no misunderstandings. At the same time, after receiving condolences, the affected schools should work harder to move forward.</p>

<h3>A Record of Inspection in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>▲The war-torn ruins are unbearable to look back on. Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Jiangwan Town was the most fiercely fought area in this battle, and suffered even greater losses than Zhabei. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency took a car to the town yesterday afternoon to inspect it. The following is a record of what he saw. ▲All the way on Jiangwan Road are rubble. Proceeding directly from North Sichuan Road, Yokohama Bridge along Jiangwan Road, one sees that the buildings on both sides are only rubble. The famous Law College, Chizhi University, Central University College, and Patriotic Girls' School all have their school buildings. The Law College's auditorium still has dilapidated walls. The rear half of Central University has become flat ground. Chizhi and Patriotic Schools also suffered heavy losses. In short, if these four schools want to reopen, they must rebuild new houses. Other houses that were destroyed along the way have already started to clear the rubble, dismantle the charred wood, and tidy them up. From the southern end of Jiangwan Road, the power lines and poles on both sides have also been supplemented and repaired by electricians. According to the workers, they can be repaired in about three days. Situation when the Japanese army was about to withdraw from Jiangwan (photographed by Li Zunyong)</p>
<p>▲The racecourse is under construction. The Jiangwan Road racecourse was repeatedly contested by both sides during the fierce fighting, so the damage is very great. The houses along the road have all been destroyed by artillery fire. When the reporter stopped his car there, he saw dozens of workers were sorting out and clearing up. I think it will be restored to its old appearance soon. The room is the farm of Lida School. There were dozens of chicken coops inside, which have been burned to ashes. However, the soybeans and wheat planted are swaying in the wind and remain intact. Opposite is Fudan University, and the damage is beyond repair. Because the Japanese army is still stationed there and was blocked, I was unable to see it in detail. ▲The principal of Lida School talks about the ashes of the robbery. Continuing forward to Lida Road, there are the Wanguo Sports Association Hospital and Yongyi Lane Lida School, etc., with fifty houses. Lida School, because it is close to the western road, was used as a battlefield during the street fighting between the two armies, so all the walls were pierced by bullets. Classrooms, dormitories, auditoriums, gatehouses, and bathrooms were all destroyed. Only a part of the boys' dormitory was left. According to Kuang Husheng, the founder of the school, to the reporter, the school was established in 1925 and has been around for seven years. At ordinary times, there are about two hundred students. Over the years, school affairs have gradually developed. Unexpectedly, it was destroyed by artillery fire. Thinking back to the beginning of the founding, it was only the efforts of a few people. Later, fortunately, it was sponsored by all parties, and the income from school side businesses such as raising chickens made the funds slightly more abundant, so it was able to roughly take shape. Unexpectedly, everything was destroyed by war, and all the work was in vain. When he spoke, he was filled with emotion. ▲The Japanese army erected a sign to preserve the traces of the war. Then I turned the car to Xinshi Road, and saw two wooden signs hanging in front of the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association and the Labor University, with the words (Preserve the traces of the war, no one is allowed to enter and destroy, otherwise they will be killed). So I stopped and did not enter, but looking at it from a distance, the inside was empty. Only the nameplate remained on the door, which was enough for me to identify it. Opposite is Jiangwan Station. The four walls of the station building are pierced with holes, but it has not yet collapsed. The interior is empty. There is a section of cars parked on the tracks, and the outer skin has been peeled off, leaving an empty shell. Many of the sleepers on the rails have also been dug up. ▲No houses survived in the whole town. Then I went to Jiangwan Town. The town straddles both sides of the Sha Jing River. There was a Xianghua Bridge that could be used for traffic. Now the Japanese army has built another wooden bridge next to it. There is a Japanese post on the south bank of the bridge, preventing forward progress. Then I went along the bank to the town and saw that none of the houses in the town had survived. Only about fifty steps away from the town, there were several low houses, two small teahouses, and a Japanese barbershop, which were operating safely. Japanese merchants and residents in the town rushed back to find relics in the rubble. It was also pitiful. ▲The people of Jiangbei are carrying out activities on a large scale. According to the servant guarding Lida School, dozens of people from Jiangbei have been stealing everywhere in recent days. Doors, windows, planks, staircases, chairs, tables, etc. in empty houses, no matter how large or small, are dismantled and transported away with axes and saws. Places such as Yongyi Lane and Hepingfang are mostly empty. These people from Jiangbei all come from Yangshupu, so the stolen items are all transported to Yangshupu. The school's hot water ting and educational supplies, etc., have been lost and recovered from there. However, there are still several cases every day, and they have not yet disappeared. ▲The inspection along the way is very strict. From Jiangwan Road to Jiangwan Town, there are Japanese marines stationed along the way, with sentry posts about forty feet apart. When the car moves forward, it must stop at each post for inspection. Even if you show your passport, you must search carefully before you can pass. It can be said that the road is difficult to travel. Yesterday was a Sunday, and men and women from various countries went to Jiangwan to visit, one after another, but they still had to stop briefly at the sentry post to wait for inspection.</p>
<h3>The Peacekeeping Police Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲Temporarily stationed in the Quanzhang Guild Hall yesterday morning ▲Part of the team will enter Zhabei this morning. The first batch of 580 personnel from the Beiping Security Force arrived in Shanghai by boat from Kunshan in the misty dawn at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. The boat docked at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf. The Public Security Bureau sent personnel to take care of them and transport their belongings ashore. In the afternoon, all the team members gathered at the Longhua Quanzhang Guild Hall. Mayor Wu gave a speech yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m. with Secretary-General Yu, Bureau Chief Wen, etc. The following is a detailed report of the situation. ▲The situation upon arrival in Shanghai. The Beiping Security Force departed from Kunshan at 9:30 p.m. the night before and came to Shanghai by thirteen small boats and a tugboat. It was originally planned to come to Shanghai via the Suzhou River, but because Japanese soldiers were still stationed in the Suzhou River area, it was feared that there would be misunderstandings, so it was changed to take a detour to the southwest via the inland rivers of Songjiang, Qingpu, etc. to the Huangpu River. On the way, they increased their speed and did not stop. They arrived at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf at 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning. At that time, the dawn was hazy and misty in the sky. ▲Personnel were sent to take care of the team after arriving in Shanghai. The team's chief, Lu Lu, and deputy chief, Zhang Wenjie, first landed and met with Wen Yingxing, director of the Public Security Bureau, who immediately sent Zhu Zhenbang, the director of the first district, and Chu Mengzhi, a special agent of the police brigade, to lead personnel to receive and negotiate everything. They went to the wharf to transport the luggage of the team members ashore. At noon, Lu and others went to meet Mayor Wu to report everything. After 2:00 p.m., they went to the China Merchants Bureau Wharf again and led all the police officers to the Longhua Quanzhang Guild Hall for temporary residence. ▲The itinerary on the way. The team left Beiping on the 8th and could have arrived in Shanghai on the 11th, but it was delayed for a long time on the way, so it did not arrive until yesterday morning. They left Beiping on the 8th and arrived in Tianjin at 10:00 p.m. that night. It took two days to make uniforms in Tianjin. They arrived in Pukou at 2:35 a.m. on the 12th. At 4:35 a.m., they crossed the river to Nanjing. At 10:00 a.m. on the 13th, they boarded the train again. The train departed at 2:00 p.m. and arrived in Changzhou at 8:00 p.m. In the morning of the 14th, they arrived in Kunshan. After a brief rest, they came to Shanghai at 9:30 p.m. the night before and arrived at the China Merchants Wharf on the Huangpu River at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. ▲Internal organization. The team has a total of 500 police officers, together with special agents, dispatchers, servants, secretaries, clerks and other staff, totaling 580 personnel. Its organization is a two-two system. The entire team is divided into two brigades, each brigade is divided into two companies, each company is divided into two platoons, and each platoon is divided into two squads, with 14 people in each squad. Among them, 120 people are equipped with box cannons and 300 people are equipped with rifles, which were issued by the Ministry of Military Affairs when they arrived in Nanjing. The team selected 250 elite police officers from Beiping and Tianjin, all of whom had received military, police, judicial and administrative training, and had sufficient knowledge and experience in police affairs. The internal personnel also have specialized knowledge, and many people are proficient in Japanese. Therefore, the security force can not only cope with military or police affairs, but also assist in judicial and administrative matters.

After the security force arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, they temporarily resided in the Quanzhang Guild Hall. Part of the team will go with the takeover committee to take over Zhabei at 9:00 a.m. today. As for the remaining 1,000 security personnel, they must also be transferred from Beiping and Tianjin. Everything is now ready and can be dispatched south as soon as a telegram is sent from Shanghai to Beiping. ▲The mayor's speech. Mayor Wu Tiecheng went to the Quanzhang Guild Hall at 5:00 p.m. yesterday with Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Secretaries Guan, Zhang, Guo Dehua, etc. and gave a speech to the entire security force, saying, "I have come here today to welcome you and comfort you. I know that you have left your parents, wives, children, and hometowns and traveled a long distance to Shanghai to serve the public. I admire you very much. You must know that men have ambitions in all directions. The national police serve the country. Now that you have come here under the orders of the government, your duties are no different from those in Beiping. Shanghai is China's largest port and a prosperous commercial center in the East. The place is important and extremely complex. Chinese police were first established in Tianjin and Beiping and are the best. The security force was also first organized in Beiping, and its achievements have always been admired by Chinese and foreigners. I hope that you will always maintain its reputation. From now on, you should pay attention to (1) giving full play to your abilities, (2) being loyal to your duties, so that the local area can be peaceful and to comfort your parents, wives, and children, etc." The US government</p>
<h3>Discusses Withdrawing the Army Stationed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>National News Agency Washington, 14th - The State Department said today that it will soon recommend withdrawing the 31st Infantry Division currently stationed in Shanghai to the Philippines. Today, Undersecretary of State Kaysington and Chief of Staff McArthur held a meeting. Kaitun said that the US government does not assume the responsibility of guarding the demilitarized zone of the Japanese army in Shanghai. However, the US Marine Corps should still be stationed in Shanghai as usual, fulfilling the normal protection responsibilities in the concession. The 31st Infantry Division does not need to be stationed in Shanghai for more than a month, because the emergency period has now obviously passed, and foreign areas in Shanghai do not need special protection.

<h3>Postal Workers Across the Country Rise Up to Save the Post Office</h3>
<p>▲Telegraph to the Executive Yuan to state the truth ▲Continued telegraph to the Ministry of Communications to approve quickly. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, the Staff Union, and postal workers' unions across the country have proposed a plan to consolidate the postal base and have repeatedly submitted it to the Ministry of Communications for implementation. They originally hoped that the Ministry of Communications would accept it sincerely from the standpoint of consolidating the post office, and implement it on a specific date to save the current postal crisis and maintain the reputation of the post office for 30 years. However, since the association repeatedly submitted it to the Ministry of Communications, there has been no reply to the reasons and facts of the association's plan. The two associations believe that the plan is the only way to save the postal crisis. If the plan is not implemented in time, the good foundation of the post office will decline day by day and will never be revived. Therefore, at this critical moment of the life and death of the post office, it is said that the two associations are not only doing their best to strive for the implementation of the plan, but also more than 30,000 postal workers across the country have the greatest determination to rise up and fight to save the post office, and would rather sacrifice for the national cause and the interests of the people, and will never stop due to any pressure. However, the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications seem to have ignored the brilliant history of past postal worker movements, and the painstaking efforts to maintain the post office this time. On the 14th, the Executive Yuan decided that the postal workers intended to strike and planned to stop and ban them. The two associations of all postal workers were shocked when they heard this, and immediately telegraphed to the Executive Yuan to state the truth, and also telegraphed to the Ministry of Communications to give a clear reply to the points submitted by the two associations one after another. The original texts of the two telegrams are recorded below. ▲Telegraph to the Executive Yuan is urgent. Nanjing Executive Yuan, the report said that on the 14th, your hospital decided to have secret reports that Shanghai workers have recently brewed a strike attempt, which should be banned, etc. Hearing the news, I was shocked. It was found that the association's proposal to consolidate the postal base was intended to save the post office, and the association was determined to do nothing else. Your hospital presides over the central government, and should be aware of the true will of the postal workers and accept it sincerely. Even if there are any shortcomings, it should give earnest instructions so that the top and bottom can work together to consolidate the postal base. If the decision reported is true, then your hospital does not seem to appreciate the loyalty of the association to save the post office, which is very confusing. At this moment, the post office is in danger, and the postal workers across the country must save it. I hope that your hospital will examine the points submitted by the association and quickly order the ministry to implement them. With great urgency, awaiting orders. ▲Telegraph to the Ministry of Communications is urgent. Nanjing Ministry of Communications, it has been found that the association has repeatedly submitted to your ministry to consolidate the postal base plan, protect the postal system, and postal workers' treatment, and requested that it be implemented quickly. The public is enthusiastic and earnestly requested to accept it quickly to consolidate the postal base, and issue a clear order to comfort the public. With great urgency, awaiting orders.

<h3>Continued Payment of Retirement Benefits</h3>
<p>According to the Commercial Press, the library decided on the dismissal method in accordance with the instructions of the Social Affairs Bureau. It started to pay the dismissed workers retirement benefits and return savings deposits on the 12th of this month. Those who have already received the money account for the majority of the workers who stayed in Shanghai. Those who have not yet received it due to business and those who continue to arrive from the mainland will continue to receive the money at 24 Ningbo Road from the 16th to the 18th of this month. A method of entrusting someone to collect the money on their behalf has also been formulated, so that the workers who have already returned to their hometowns do not have to come to Shanghai to collect the money in person, so as to save the trouble of traveling back and forth. It is also heard that according to the retirement treatment method decided by the Social Affairs Bureau, the library will send a total of more than 670,000 yuan to the workers after returning more than 870,000 yuan of savings deposits to the workers. The board of directors of the library discussed it for a long time, believing that the company is in such a difficult situation, and in terms of economic ability, it cannot afford this burden. However, in order to follow the principle of caring for the workers, it will reluctantly comply with it in the midst of great difficulties. However, its ability has been exhausted and there can be no other way. It is rumored outside that the two directors of the library, Zhang and Gao, plan to mediate again, which is not true.</p>
<h3>Appeal from Workers of the Sanyou Company</h3>
<p>The urgent declaration of the Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union of this city states: To the attention of all national institutions, public organizations, and compatriots from all walks of life, the weakness of our country and the great shame of our nation lie in the stagnation of industry and the decline of commerce. Our union workers have always held the aim of seeking happiness for society and survival for the nation, serving the Sanyou Industrial Corporation's main factory for nearly twenty years. Unexpectedly, due to the recent Shanghai Incident, the lives of the workers have become arduous, and they have shed tears of pain that are difficult to express. However, now that the overall situation has been decided, our fellow industrialists should strive forward even more. Moreover, the authorities have long issued clear orders to all factories to rectify and restore operations as usual. Contrary to this, the Sanyou Industrial Corporation, which has a booming and brilliant history of nearly twenty years, not only fails to consider the overall industrial plan but also disregards the safety of both parties, taking advantage of this time of hardship to oppress the workers. Such behavior is neither legal nor just, and it also violates the intentions of the authorities. Recalling that in the first year of the Republic of China, the Sanyou Industrial Corporation had a capital of only a few thousand yuan, and its bright and brilliant success today is partly due to the capitalists' ability to adapt to circumstances, but its lifeline has been created by the blood and sweat of the workers. Since the establishment of our union in the 17th year of the Republic of China, there has not only been no dispute with the capitalists, but also a sudden and rapid increase in productivity. The capitalists' profits have been hundreds of thousands each year, which shows the success. However, when the war broke out, the capitalists not only ignored the workers but regarded it as the end of our workers, wanting to dissolve the company as soon as possible. Thousands of our workers have suffered this double disaster, lost their means of livelihood, and endured hunger and cold, wandering for four months. At a time when the national crisis is severe and the future of society is full of hidden worries, the capitalists are acting ruthlessly. For the sake of the workers' livelihoods and the happiness of society, our union has repeatedly petitioned various administrative organs, demanding that the capitalists provide relief. The authorities have repeatedly instructed them to handle it, but the capitalists have ignored it completely, turning a deaf ear. Recently, they have even moved the machinery of the main factory to the Hangzhou branch, using the excuse of difficulty in resuming operations to take the opportunity to oppress the workers. The government has already issued clear orders to stop this, but the capitalists are still creating difficulties. Although party and government organs have sincerely mediated repeatedly, they have all been perfunctorily dealt with. For the sake of the safety of the future, our union has made many concessions, but not only has it not received understanding, but this retreat has led to further advances by the capitalists, placing the workers in a desperate situation. Now, our union still holds the aim of seeking complete preservation through compromise, making many concessions, and seeking a way for both parties to coexist. If the capitalists stubbornly insist on their own way and disregard justice, then the workers of our union, who have long been determined, will not give up until they achieve their minimum goals. Then, the hidden worries of the future will not only be the misfortune of all the workers of our union, but also what will become of the happiness of the future of society? Our union, on the one hand, fears that the capitalists will not realize their error, and on the other hand, fears that all sectors of society will not be able to understand the truth. We hope that all compatriots from all walks of life will uphold justice and provide us with support. We solemnly declare this. Jiangsu Province</p>

<h3>Declaration Against Opium Monopoly Sales</h3>
<p>The National Crisis Relief Association, when the brutal Japanese invaders are encroaching and the national crisis is imminent, now is the critical autumn for survival. How should we encourage ourselves to rescue the country from danger? But the authorities in various provinces have issued chaotic orders, implementing opium monopoly sales, treating prohibition orders like discarded shoes, and betting the country as a last resort. The central government watches indifferently, without stopping it. When the news came, our hair stood on end in grief. Upon examining the reasons for our country's weakness, opium is the step to make it worse. People's livelihood is in decline, the national economy is shrinking day by day. If the poison is not eliminated, the country's fortune will not recover. Are the instructions of the martyrs empty words? Those in power know the harm, but they are blinded by the interests of the poison, leading to losing their minds and competing to chase after them, reversing course and implementing this flawed policy, not hesitating to harm the foundation of the country, making us a laughingstock to friendly countries. In the past, the central government had the establishment of the Opium Prohibition Investigation Office, and after consistent protests from the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association and others, it was finally abolished by the court order. The people cheered and said that the government of the people is different from the domineering warlords. Unexpectedly, less than a year later, the rulers of various provinces, taking advantage of the nation's inability to look inward while facing external enemies, do not plan for national prosperity, but instead diligently seek profit, making the poison their goal. The ashes are rekindled, and the old forces are making a comeback. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? This association is touched by the difficulties of the times and refuses to remain silent. Therefore, it issues a special declaration, vowing to oppose it to the death. It is hoped that the Anti-Drug Association will lead the people and fight bravely, so that the plan to drink poison will not leave us with national shame. This association is determined to save the country and vows to be the rearguard. This is the declaration. ▲National Striving Association, the 21st year of the Republic of China. The noise of opium monopoly sales has been rising and falling, with almost no peace for a day. Especially in the recent five years after the establishment of the national government, the opium monopoly of the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Opium Prohibition Investigation Office of the 20th year of the Republic of China, and the Narcotics Management Agency of the same year, although all were extinguished by the uprising of our people, only appearing as a fleeting moment, the authorities, surrounded by villains on all sides, can’t forget the poisonous profits, and then five years are like one day. At this time of national crisis, with everything hanging by a thread, the thieves who are running the public sale are heartless and take advantage of the opportunity to relive the old dream, offering plans and running between the doors of the nobles who can’t forget the poisonous profits. Therefore, the special tax in the two lakes has not been lifted, and the special tax in Anhui has followed. The Opium Inspection Office in Fujian has not been overthrown, and Hebei, Rehe, Suiyuan and Shanxi have jointly sold it. Recently, it is brewing in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Now, the central government is playing deaf and dumb, hoping for its success. All these are the result of the villains running and encouraging, which is also the key point of our people's vow to fight to the death. Now, the national fortune is declining, and foreign insults are pressing harder every day. It can only prolong its breath and not lose the spirit of an independent country, relying on the unyielding hearts and the inspiring spirits of the people. The spirit of struggle of our people has long been evident in the world. The understanding of the harm of opium and the determination to resist monopoly sales are admired by the whole country. Those who bear the highest responsibility for opium prohibition but neglect their duties and violate the law, such as Liu Ruiheng, and those who advocate and run the public sale, such as Li Jihong and Wu Liande, vow to follow all walks of life, beat drums and attack, and destroy the dregs of the Republic of China and the parasites of the country to comfort our Premier's soul in heaven, striving forward without hesitation. This is the declaration. Xixinqiao Street</p>
<h3>A Young Man Assassinated</h3>
<p>▲The deceased's name is Xiaoniupi, a gangster from Hongkou ▲Shot twice, the murderer escaped on the spot At 10:25 last night, three shots suddenly rang out in the middle of the crowd at the intersection of Xixinqiao Street and Caishi Street in the French Concession. A young man fell in response, hit by two bullets in the head and right waist, and died instantly. When the shots rang out, passers-by scattered and fled, and the murderer took the opportunity to escape. Then, the patrolmen and Chinese police officers quickly reported to the police station and dispatched detectives to investigate. The deceased was wearing a blue cloth lined robe, white cloth lining, Zhigong ne He mouth shoes, and yellow silk socks. According to witnesses, the deceased was seen walking with a young man wearing a black gown and a copper basin-style felt hat. Unexpectedly, when they reached the center of the street, the young man suddenly drew a gun and shot the deceased three times, and then fled west. At that time, more and more viewers gathered. Some people said that the deceased's name was Xiaoniupi, a well-known gangster in Hongkou, and that this time he was killed because of a fight among his own kind. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for an autopsy and reported to the Second Special District Court for inspection.</p>
<h3>Gunshots Where the Gong Sounds</h3>
<p>▲Chen Quanlin Calls the Police and Is Injured ▲All Robbers Escape Without a Trace At the home of Chen Quanlin, a villager in Wujiabang, east of Yangjing Town, Pudong, around 11 o'clock the night before last, more than ten robbers suddenly came, each wielding iron rods and pistols. At that time, Chen heard a gunshot outside the door and woke up from his sleep. Then, he got up and slipped out the back door, ringing a gong to warn others. The robbers immediately fired several shots in the direction of the gong, and Chen was accidentally shot in the shoulder, falling to the ground in extreme pain with blood flowing like a river. At that time, Pan Guangqi, the leader of the first team of the Yangjing District Protection Team, led armed team members to catch the robbers. Seeing that things were not going well, the robbers charged south and escaped. The team members chased them to the border of Shangnan, but because the weather was dark and the path was indistinguishable, they could not pursue them further. The robbers were able to escape. Yesterday morning, Chen reported the incident to the Second Branch of the Third District. Director Li inspected the wounds and ordered Chen to go to the hospital for treatment and ordered the police to investigate and capture the robbers. Engineers from the Junpu Bureau</p>
<h3>Suspects Confess in Robbery and Murder Case</h3>
<p>▲The suspects do not admit to the crime ▲Witnesses say they don't remember On the afternoon of May 30th, Republic Year 19, the Junpu Bureau sent Chinese and foreign engineers on a small steamer to Wusong to distribute pay. Unexpectedly, Zhang Genbao and Feng Qing, who had already been shot by the local court, colluded with accomplices to drive a small steamer, blocking the Junpu Bureau's small steamer, robbing a large sum of money, and shooting and killing one Chinese and one foreign engineer on the spot, and shooting and wounding five crew members. The main culprits in the case, Zhang Genbao and others, were arrested and shot early. Last year, Zhang Changsheng and Yao Jinxiang from Pudong were arrested on Songshan Road in the French Concession for carrying pistols. After being brought to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation, they were found to be robbers of the Junpu Bureau. Yao also claimed to have received fifty yuan from Zhang Changsheng. Zhang's sister, Li Zhang, was also involved in the case and was arrested together. The court has now filed a public prosecution. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen opened the court. Zhang Changsheng confessed that he was 27 years old, from Shanghai, and was a coppersmith. In February of the 16th year of the Republic of China, he went to the Guangchang Rice Factory in Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, as an official. Last year, he came to Shanghai due to the flood. The pistol was given to him by Li Xingbao, which led to his arrest. He really did not know about the steamer robbery case. Yao Jinxiang confessed that he was 23 years old, from Shanghai, and was arrested in August last year. I knew Zhang Changsheng because we were colleagues before, but I did not know Zhang Genbao. I borrowed fifty yuan from Zhang Changsheng, which is true, but it was not stolen money, and I was not at the scene of the robbery. Li Zhang confessed that she was 36 years old. Zhang Changsheng is her younger brother. She was in another province. After her husband died, she returned. It was really unjust, and so on. When asked to each witness, they all confessed that the robbers all had Pudong accents, but the only person we witnessed who fired the gun was Zhang Genbao, who had already been executed. The others we do not remember. The official said that further investigation was needed and ordered them to be remanded for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>One Hundred Thousand Red Pills</h3>
<p>▲Sent in a concealed postal package ▲Detected by inspectors A young boy from Ningbo named Xu Jincheng, 13 years old, between the 20th and 13th of this month, was instructed by a Zhou living at No. 66 Ximen Road in the French Concession to deliver a total of 42 packages to the general post office on North Sichuan Road. They were printed materials sent by the Shanghai Huiwen Bookstore to a certain place on Erma Road in Xuzhou. Gao, an inspector at the post office, noticed that one of the packages was larger and different, so he held it in his hand. Its quality was very heavy, so he transferred it to the general manager's office for inspection. All the contents were red pills. The Xu boy was detained, and the Hongkou police station was telegraphed to send Chinese and Western detectives to come and take him and the red pills to the police station. After opening several packages, it was found that they all contained red pills, totaling more than 100,000 pills. After questioning the location of the manufacturing organization, they rushed to the address with the relevant police station detectives to arrest the Zhou. But he had already heard the news and escaped. The suspects Zhang, Zhu, four men and women were arrested and taken to the French police station for separate detention. The day before yesterday, the Hongkou police station escorted the Xu boy to the first special district court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station lawyer, stated the case and said that the suspects arrested in the French Concession had been escorted to the second special district court for interrogation. The red pills were presented for inspection. It was found that the Huiwen Bookstore was a fictitious name. This case was requested for postponement. Then, Gao, the inspector of the post office, reported the details. He questioned Xu boy, who confessed that he was fooled by the Zhou, who was on the run. At that time, he claimed that they were all printed materials, please review, and he also hired Liang Bohua as a lawyer. Judge Qiao Wanxuan ordered him to be temporarily detained and rescheduled for investigation. Robbing the Wing On Cotton Mill</p>
<h3>Four Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>▲Interrogated once before further questioning The Wing On Cotton Mill at 55 Maigen Road in western Shanghai was suddenly invaded by several robbers at 8:00 PM on the 15th of last month. The factory staff were all panicked, and seeing that the robbers were armed with pistols, they dared not speak out. The robbers drove everyone into a corner and then began to search. They robbed 3,950 yuan in cash. The staff reported to the police station and requested an investigation after the robbers escaped. A few days ago, Chinese and Western detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station learned that the robbers in the case, Wu Shoumin, Cao Fubao, Ma Dongsheng, and Zhou Zhicheng, all from Jiangbei, were hiding somewhere, so they rushed to the scene and arrested them all. They were brought back to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Court the day before yesterday. After Judge Feng questioned them, he ordered them to be remanded in custody pending further interrogation. New Scam</p>
<h3>Glass Insurance Company</h3>
<p>▲Silk shop deceived ▲Two swindlers escape A new scam technique was discovered in this city last winter, and although it was only a fleeting moment, there were already many fools in the business community. The swindlers were Guangdong native Tan Yongye and Suzhou native Wang Renjie, and now they are both in hiding. As for the scam they used, they started with the glass doors and windows of major stores, because these types of glass are usually large and each piece is worth a lot of money. If there is any damage, the loss is huge. So they used this situation to falsely set up a Zhong'an Glass Insurance Company somewhere. Tan acted as the manager of the company, and Wang acted as a peddler, soliciting insurance for the glass on doors and windows from stores with glass doors and windows all day long. In order to strengthen the trust of the insured, they falsely claimed that the company's capital was fully paid up to 200,000 yuan and that it had been registered with the ministry. After Lao Jiuhe Silk Shop on Nanjing Road was deceived by Wang Renjie's glib tongue, they signed a contract with the company on October 5th last year to guarantee ten pieces of glass on the front door. The term was one, and they paid 24 taels of insurance silver. Unexpectedly, just two months later, on the night of December 12, someone suddenly damaged two pieces of glass with potion. Lao Jiuhe sent someone to Zhong'an Company to notify them according to the insurance policy and asked for compensation. But at this time, the so-called company was no longer in the original place, and they could not find it everywhere. Tan and Wang also both hid. The inside story began to be exposed. But not long after, the Shanghai War broke out, so it was not until today that Lao Jiuhe filed a private complaint with the First Special District Court against the two swindlers, Tan and Wang, requesting that they be punished for fraud and ordered to compensate for the glass silver of 203 taels, or to replace two pieces of glass of the original shape. Wu, the judge, opened the court yesterday. Because the defendant could not be summoned, the case was postponed again. Although the money swindled in this case was small, its imagination was unique. It is recorded to see the wonders of Shanghai society.</p>

<h3>Impersonating Shenxin Factory Products</h3>
<p>▲ Appeal against the original judgment opens for trial. Zheng Kang, a Ningbo native and owner of Dafeng Yarn Shop at No. 50 West Xinqiao Street in the French Concession, during the period of resisting inferior goods, relabeled forty-two count Blue Phoenix brand cotton yarn as sixteen count Human Bell brand cotton yarn produced by the Chinese Shenxin Yarn Factory, displaying it in his shop and selling it for profit. This was discovered by the Shenxin Factory, which reported it to the Public Concession Police on January 16th of this year (at which time a large quantity of similar counterfeit goods was seized in the Public Concession, and the suspects were detained for interrogation by the First Special Court). The report was forwarded to the French Concession Police, who dispatched Detective Gu Mingzhou, together with Tong Jiarui, a representative of the Shenxin Factory, to search the Dafeng Yarn Shop, where they found forty-three bales of counterfeit yarn. Zheng was taken into custody and sent to the Second Special District Court, where he was prosecuted under Articles 269 and 363 of the Criminal Code for obstructing commerce and fraud. The case was heard by the previous Judge Ma, and the defendant argued that the Blue Phoenix brand label had been blown onto the Human Bell brand yarn by the wind. He also retained lawyer Gu Jirong to defend him. After summoning witnesses and conducting two rounds of questioning, the court ruled that Zheng had used fraudulent tactics to damage the credit of others, and sentenced him to eight months of imprisonment and a fine of three hundred yuan. The counterfeit cotton yarn was confiscated. All these details were reported in previous newspapers. Now, Zheng, dissatisfied with the original judgment, has again retained lawyer Gu to present reasons and file an appeal, which has been approved. Judge Xiong has repeatedly opened investigation hearings, summoning witnesses and completing the questioning. On the afternoon of the previous day at 3 p.m., the head of the Criminal Court, Wang Gangxu, along with Judges Xiong Huiping and Li Changnian, and Clerk Tao Zongkan, joined forces with Prosecutor Wu Xiaoke to open a joint court hearing. After lawyers Fei Xizhen for the police and the appellant's lawyer debated successively, the court ordered the conclusion of the debate and scheduled a date for sentencing. The appellant was ordered to provide a shop guarantee of five hundred yuan and wait for instructions outside.</p>
<h3>An Increasingly Bizarre Extortion Case</h3>
<p>▲ Wang Zuzhen Confesses Directly ▲ Other Suspects Claim Wang is Uninvolved. Tang Songqing, a doctor residing at Qiasheng Lane, Xueyuan Road, Nanshi, received five or six threatening letters signed "Three K Party" a week ago, attempting to extort a large sum of three hundred yuan. In the last letter, the amount was reduced by half, and a bullet for a six-round pistol was enclosed. The letter stipulated that the money should be wrapped and placed at the foot of the left wall of the lane at 3 p.m. on the previous day (the 13th). After receiving the letter, Tang secretly reported it to the Security Corps, who, along with the head of the First District, Second Precinct, and disguised police officers, intercepted three individuals on the spot: Huang Xiaogou, Huang Afu, and Huang Zhiming. Another individual, Wang Apin, was arrested at the Qingyun Hotel on Dongzilaihuo Street in the French Concession. Details have been reported in this newspaper. However, during the search of the hotel, a young man claimed to be surnamed Wang, stating that he had been falsely accused and seeking leniency. At the time, Director Yi believed him to be truthful. Unexpectedly, after repeated questioning yesterday, the truth came to light. It turned out that the man's original name was Wang Zuzhen, 25 years old, from Zhenhai, a graduate of Fudan University, and currently an accountant at the Salt Revenue Audit Office. He admitted to being the mastermind of the case, claiming that all five or six threatening letters and the bullet sent to Tang were his doing alone, and that those arrested were all wrongly accused. Director Yi further questioned the arrested suspects, but they insisted that Wang was not involved and that they were solely responsible. At this point, Wang was ordered to verify the handwriting, but it was completely different from that of the letters sent to Tang, leaving everyone confused. The director then ordered that all suspects be handed over to the Judicial Section for further investigation.</p>

Currently, 50 boxes of dried egg white and 85 barrels of liquid yolk from Dingji Factory, 18 boxes of dried egg white and 42 barrels of liquid yolk from Fengyu Factory, and 40 boxes of dried egg white and 58 barrels of liquid yolk from Fuchang Factory have all been detained at the Bengbu Special Egg Tax Bureau. It has been found that factory-made egg yolks and whites are subject to business tax paid by the factory and the申莊, and since the implementation of tariff autonomy, export taxes have increased threefold. Now, with this disguised likin, merchants will find it difficult to accept. Fresh goods are easily spoiled if stored for too long, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, we urgently request your Excellency to immediately telegraph the bureau to release the goods and to prevent any further difficulties in the future. We eagerly await your command. Sincerely, Shanghai Egg Factory Trade Association."</p>

<h3>Gold Price Continues to Fall by Ten Taels</h3>

<h3>Last Week had a Thriving Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The long-silent cotton yarn suddenly became active last week, making great progress and exhibiting a thriving economic atmosphere. The reasons are as follows: (1) The Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement has been signed, and Japanese troops have begun to withdraw. (2) The Shanghai financial community sees the situation gradually recovering, and there may be adjustments and assistance for legitimate business, unlike the previous stagnation. (3) The authorities have been working hard to restore the areas vacated by the Japanese army to their original state as soon as possible. The various cloth factories in the nearby Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, which were hit hard by the war, have all announced closures. Now, with the peace of the situation, there is news of their resumption of work and business, and raw materials must be purchased. (4) The price of 20-count 人鐘yarn has fallen by 23 or 4 taels from its February peak, and 42-count 人鐘thread has fallen by as much as 75 taels. Cotton yarn is a necessity for life. With these four major reasons, the various帮's temporary environments have improved, so they have purchased in large quantities. However, in the north, which is within the sphere of influence of the Japanese army, the cotton yarn has long been occupied by them, and Chinese yarn has no room to插足. Only in the south, which has been silent for a long time, has purchased vigorously this week. The most purchases were from Guangdong, Yunnan, and Fujian, followed by Changsha, Jiangxi, and Sichuan. It was found that the various帮purchased a total of 22,870 bales, and the同行bought 4,000 bales. The various factories opened a lot of contracts this week, and the market rose by 2 or 3 taels compared to the previous week. The旺销of yarn is the first sound since the Shanghai incident. However, according to another investigation, the各帮bought about 40,000 bales of cotton yarn during this development, but many manufacturers ship them to various ports themselves, and it is difficult to know on the market. And some do not want to publish detailed information, and the customs report must be checked for verification. At the weekend, the demand for spot yarn from various parties had a 馆满 appearance, and the general public had a疲look. The factory's bottom goods松去a lot, and some manufacturers have already售罄, so their attitude is more昂. As for the khách hang buying in such large quantities, there will naturally be a 休 息, according to the general trend. The yarn price may盤旋for a while, but the raw materials are still cheap, the factory's costs are cheap, and the world's cotton industry is still sluggish and depressed. Moreover, Japanese factories are making fierce progress, with many strong enemies, so the future situation is殊不敢必也. The exchange's 标 on Monday was停市due to May 9th, and the outside現需was rising, so the opening on Tuesday rose盤盤, rising 3 taels and 6 qian in one day. Later, because the various幫 continued to purchase constantly, the situation was tight in the middle, and the涨风was sharp, but the number of成交did not have a huge存賬, so the market situation was still和平. At the weekend, people's hearts slightly转和緩, because the economy of all parties was not fully流通, the raw materials were very cheap, and the yarn sales were feared to be lacking in positive power. Some疲, so the盘then appeared to fall. The prices of the various months rose 3 or 4 taels higher than the previous week, and the total number of成交was 56,600 bales. Now, the number of bales bought by the various幫口is listed as follows: 帮口 Package Amount 帮口 Package Amount Shantou 3385 Fujian 40 Guangdong 8490 Yunnan 1260 Changsha 1590 Wuhu 10 内地 1760 Zhenjiang 215 Hankou 45 Wenzhou 135 北帮 560 Anqing 45 Tianjin 110 Weihaiwei 20 Jiangxi 1765 Luzhou 175 Nanyang 95 Qingdao 55 Ningbo 255 Sichuan 2865 Total 22870 packages 同行4000 Also, the high and low prices of 20-count 人标yarn are recorded for one week: 人标 Monday Price Highest Lowest Weekend Price July 153.2 156.7 153.2 155.0 August 152.7 157.0 152.7 155.2 September 153.4 157.0 153.4 155.5 October 153.5 157.4 152.5 155.7 Last week's 期现棉</p>
<h3>All Present a Peaceful Hue</h3>
<p>The cotton market is still relatively calm, but based on the overall situation, there is no great force for either rise or fall. Overseas, the Indian and American cotton markets remain sluggish and stagnant, hovering around 5.67 cents. Therefore, everyone is adopting a wait-and-see attitude. However, ordinary retail investors, seeing that the cotton stock in Shanghai is low, and secondly, the standard has been raised a level, Shanghai cotton (formerly known as "Huoji" cotton) has already been appraised and decided to be two liang and seven qian and five fen lower in grade. The current standard price is auctioned at thirty-two liang, seven qian and five fen, valuing Shanghai cotton at around thirty liang. Currently, the actual selling price of Shanghai cotton outside can reach thirty liang, so the market atmosphere is extremely dull and lifeless. Previously, due to the active yarn market, some yarn factories sold their yarn and purchased some raw materials, causing the market to suddenly tighten and rise by five qian. Over the weekend, foreign cotton was peddled in the market at very low prices. One cotton merchant engaged in arbitrage, and the market experienced a decline. However, assessing the global situation, it is still in a soft state. The future direction still depends on the global cotton market's progress. Demand from various factories remains flat. American cotton spot prices have fallen fifteen pounds compared to the previous week. The highest price seen for marked cotton mid-week was three liang and four qian, but it returned downwards over the weekend, resulting in a price that was flat compared to the previous week. The transaction volume for marked cotton was 66,200 dan. The prices of spot cotton purchased by various factories are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Tea Market Rises Then Falls Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, the green tea market in this port for both foreign and local traders had successively opened. Total transactions for Zhenmei and Zhenmei needle-tip green teas for the entire week were 1,910 boxes, with market fluctuations as large as 10 to 20 liang. When local traders' Zhenmei entered the market, British merchants Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Gibb Livingston, and Tung Foo, as well as the White Head trading house Yu Long, all competed to purchase the new tea, making the market very lively. However, due to the scarcity of goods from factories, demand exceeded supply. The Suian Zhenmei produced by local traders opened at 120 liang and rose to 135 liang. Huzhou goods opened at 110 liang and rose to 125 liang. Zhuji and Xiaoshan goods also rose to 115 liang. Later, the Suian Zhenmei from foreign traders arriving in Shanghai surprisingly opened at 170 liang. The market's activity was like a rising tide. However, since last Friday, after the exchange rate changed drastically, the market plummeted. British traders adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The market for Zhenmei from both foreign and local traders suddenly fell by 10 to 20 liang. However, transactions were still sluggish. British traders, due to the uncertain exchange rate and the distant shipping schedule, were not in a hurry. Therefore, weekend transactions remained few, it is said.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market in Pudong is Rising</h3>
<p>▲Yesterday, the various guilds in South Shanghai had about 17 or 18 sources. The number of people present at the market in the morning was not very enthusiastic. Moreover, the northern market increased prices, and people's hearts were rising. Top-quality Su and Chang goods suddenly rose by about 1 jiao. Thin rice goods were scarce, and Ningwei rice was available in small quantities. The outgoing routes on this street were average, and market prices followed up by nearly a jiao. Foreign Lu-jian rice was sold as soon as it arrived, and Baiyuan wine stomach was quite refreshing. The situation was trending upwards.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, the northern market received about 23 or 24 shipments from inland. Transactions on this street were initially stagnant but later became active. Wuxi and Kunshan rice had the strongest momentum. Opening prices in the morning fell by nearly a chi, but turned weak in the afternoon. Early rice, thin rice, and Feilai Feng (Three Phoenixes) varieties were purchased by the junk guilds for 500 shi. Prices were similar to the previous market. Lu Yang-jian sales were slightly tight. Glutinous rice was neither thriving nor declining.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Coarse Sand White Turns Steady After Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market and exchange trading conducted by the association gradually became more prosperous, but market prices fell. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white traded at 13 liang, 3 qian, 7.5 fen. High-quality MO brand at 13 liang, 4 qian. Hong Kong goods at 13 liang, 2 qian, 2.5 fen. Tomorrow's arrival, Qianxing Company sold several hundred bags, price 13 liang 2 qian, brokers were quite enthusiastic, and the market trend turned bullish. No. 10 Dutch red at 9 liang, 8 qian, 5 fen. Finely ground white sugar at 13 liang, 4 qian, 5 fen. The market was still stable, but transactions were scarce. Taikoo sugar imports and exports were very sluggish, OW brand at 15 liang, 9 qian, 5 fen, HM brand at 13 liang, 9 qian, 5 fen, later rising to 14 liang. The market looked stable and elegant. Zhenxing Factory opened with over one hundred packages of yellow factory ice at 15 liang, 1 qian.</p>
<h3>Hardware New Lead Wire Customer Sales Slightly Move</h3>
<p>New lead wire, which had been quiet for many days, saw some activity yesterday because customers were inquiring and local factories also had some business. As a result, the market situation gradually improved, and the standard price therefore gradually rose. Thus, each dan could be sold for 12 liang, 5 qian (No. 16 to No. 20). No. 21 to No. 25, each box could also be valued at 18 liang, 5 qian. It was found that over 600 boxes were opened yesterday, all of which were purchased by customers from the Yangtze River area.</p>
<h3>New Road Skins Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Six-fen new road skins had been out of stock for many days, so general buyers were generally unable to purchase them. Yesterday, it was heard that New Taikoo Warehouse had loaded over 600 dan, so there was no shortage of spot goods on the market for the time being.</p>
<h3>Coal Jiawang Coal Arrives Sparsely, Sales are Weak</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident and the disruption of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, Jiawang coal from Xuzhou has been cut off from here. Now it is transported by waterway, but the cost is not very cost-effective. Therefore, arrivals are scarce. Recently, it was found that the current stock of spot goods in various warehouses in Shanghai is about 2,000 tons in total, but sales are poor, so market prices are also weak. It is estimated that screened lump coal currently sells for 11 liang per ton, and coal fines for 9 liang, it is said.</p>

<h3>The Story of a Poor Musician's Sudden Wealth</h3>
<p>— Yin Hong</p>
<p>There was a lowly musician whose family never had enough to eat for the next day, living as neighbors with hungry ghosts. One morning, he awoke from a dream to suddenly become extremely wealthy. Isn't this an astonishing and strange event? How could I not write about it?</p>
<p>Eilenburg is a small village in Saxony, Germany. The village had a poor musician who carried a broken violin around every day, running between neighborhood taverns and country dances, trying to make a living. Yet, he never managed to save a single penny. He had a large family to feed: a wife and seven daughters. In this time of economic panic, their livelihood was more difficult than ever. They even sold their household belongings one by one to barely make ends meet. The nine members of the family were barely able to avoid starving to death.</p>
<p>The poor musician had a great-uncle named Schoene, who had emigrated to Australia over a hundred years ago. He was diligent and frugal. With the arrival of opportunity, he actually started from scratch and ended up owning five gold mines, becoming a wealthy old man with a round face. Schoene died abroad in 1899. The Austrian government had been searching for the German expatriate's heirs for a long time without success. On Christmas Eve of the following year, they published a notice in the Rheinische Zeitung. It began by stating Schoene's death and continued by saying that the government was searching for legal heirs to inherit his estate.</p>
<p>However, the musician in Eilenburg had neither spare money nor had ever purchased a newspaper. The Austrian government's notice never came to his attention. But some things are beyond human intention. The musician had an eldest daughter who worked as a servant in the kitchen of a certain teacher at a school in Eilenburg. One day, she accidentally noticed a notice in a Dresden newspaper. She immediately dropped her knife and chopping board and ran to her father, describing what she had seen. Her father immediately traveled to Austria with an interpreter from the German consulate. They went straight to the local government in Melbourne. Schoene's enormous estate of 32 million gold marks finally had an owner. However, according to the Austrian government's statement, since the search for an owner had taken a long time, the government now requested a delay in payment.</p>
<p>Although the Austrian government could not pay the enormous sum of 32 million marks in one go, it still paid 5 million marks at the time. The remaining sum was secured by real estate, which was managed by government officials. The musician from Eilenburg did not want to make things difficult for the government and agreed to everything. He happily took the 5 million marks and returned home.</p>
<p>This matter spread to the newspapers in Berlin and was cited as conversation material.</p>
<h3>Encouragement for China's Little Cat</h3>
<p>— Pan Xi</p>
<p>France has a maverick named Clemenceau, nicknamed "The Tiger." The French also praised him as the "Father of Victory." He was the French Prime Minister during the European War, known for his strong leadership and brilliant talent. Clemenceau wrote a book called "Grandeur and Misery of Victory," which contained many criticisms of contemporary figures. When describing the attitudes of diplomats from various countries during the Paris Peace Conference, he repeatedly referred to China's representative, Gu Weijun, as "China's Little Cat." At the time, Gu Weijun was fighting hard for the Shandong issue and had many passionate debates at the conference. Clemenceau was quite impressed. Because he considered himself a tiger, he used the metaphor of a little cat for Gu Weijun. This was spread as a good story, but it was inevitably too self-important. I believe that cats are far more beneficial to humans than tigers because they can catch mice. Tigers often harm people, while cats often benefit people. Isn't the difference not that great? Even in terms of ferocity, cats are not inferior to tigers. Please allow me to use Li Bai's poem as proof. (This poem was discovered later and is not included in Li Hanlin's collection.) During the Qianlong Dynasty of the Qing Dynasty, a divination altar was set up in a certain county in Shanxi. One day, Li Bai descended to the altar. The disciples of the altar, knowing that Li Bai was a poet from the Tang Dynasty, requested a poem. Coincidentally, they saw a cat in the corridor, so they pointed to it as the topic. The spirit of the god said that the topic was too easy and allowed rhyming with restrictions. The words "nine, chives, wine" were used as restrictions. These three words were actually unrelated to the topic and could be considered difficult. The spirit of the god immediately wrote a seven-character quatrain: (A cat resembles a tiger eighteen or nineteen, eats all the fish and shrimp but doesn't eat chives. Only because it catches mice too wildly, it overturns a pot of wine at the head of the bed.) Judging from this poem, although a cat is small, how is it less powerful than a tiger? Now, this little cat who resembles a tiger and is good at catching mice is doing his best for the country, venturing out beyond the borders. News has come that he is indeed not afraid of the Japanese threats and can reject the interference of rebels. It is especially hoped that he will remain unyielding and capture all the (daylight mice) that openly appear in broad daylight one by one. Then, the saying in the Book of Rites (welcoming the cat because it eats field mice) can be recited for Gu Weijun. When the matter is completed and he returns, he can receive the enthusiastic welcome from all circles without shame. Be encouraged, little cat! May you consider my words as fertile soil.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Establishes a Shrine for Six Worthies</h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang, who is living in seclusion in Mount Tai to recuperate, has been attracting attention with his recent words and deeds. Some say that he is preparing to go to Guangdong to participate in a certain event, but it is heard that this is a rumor spread by nervous people and is not factual. Recently, he built a shrine for six worthies in the Guandi Temple on Mount Tai. The six worthies, chosen subjectively by him, are the four generals of the 19th Route Army who were most active in resisting the Japanese in the Shanghai Incident: Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, and Dai Ji, as well as the philanthropist Zhu Qinglan, and Wang Hu, the former Jiangsu Provincial Governor Feng's teacher of Chinese literature. Each has a memorial tablet erected. The memorial tablets for Chen, Jiang, Cai, and Dai are inscribed with words such as "(The spirit tablet of General so-and-so from a certain province, who resisted Japan and saved the country)" The memorial tablets for Zhu and Wang are inscribed with words such as "(The spirit tablet of a truly upright and caring official, so-and-so from a certain province)." Feng personally inscribed them. Every morning, he leads the residents and servants to pay respects to the tablets of the immortals. His appearance is very respectful, hoping to encourage good customs and promote benevolence, it is said.</p>
<h3>Majestic City Walls and Parrots</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>|One of the Writings on the Old Capital|</p>
<p>After the train passed (Fengtai), the night had already cast its black sleeves across the sky. The lights inside the carriage were already lit, illuminating the travelers dozing off, heads drooping, in the dim yellow light. Outside, snowflakes were falling, and the wind was sharp, but the train, like a beast, lumbered forward, pulling the snake-like carriages towards the old capital. From time to time, it let out one or two sharp, short whistles, as if to tell people that it was getting closer to the old capital.</p>
<p>Around nine o'clock in the evening, one could see sparse lights outside the train window, as well as the dark monsters – the majestic city walls – rushing past. Suddenly, the whistle sounded a few more times, and the passengers on the train all began to stir, some moving their luggage, others standing up and yawning.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, but also expectedly, the train stopped in a brightly lit place, followed by a burst of noise and shouting. The old capital had arrived.</p>
<h3>Several Manifestations</h3>
<p>— Cailiang</p>
<p>The flames of war in Shanghai have just subsided. The dancing craze in the foreign concessions is at its height. Surrounded by beauties and immersed in pleasure. This is the manifestation of the modern youth.</p>
<p>The rivers and mountains of the entire country can be given away. Only my territory is difficult to give up. Speculating and seeking petty advantages, standing by with folded arms. This is the manifestation of the mighty warlords.</p>
<p>Internal unity is not seen. External humiliation has already been established. National rights can be damaged. Private desires are difficult to extinguish. This is the manifestation of the respected officials.</p>
<p>The Japanese gold coins are lovely. The title of traitor, what does it matter? Willing to sell the country, enduring humiliation to seek glory. This is the manifestation of the puppet traitors.</p>
<p>The grand proposals for saving the country are repeatedly advocated. The actual effect of rescuing the people is difficult to achieve. The authorities are numb. The populace is ignorant. This is the manifestation of the national masses.</p>
<h3>Everyone Eats Together</h3>
<p>— Rui Quan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I and two friends were walking on a busy road in Shanghai, just as every household was having lunch one after another. Some had already eaten, some were eating, and some were about to eat. The sight made one realize that they had food to eat, and their expressions were happy. Unconsciously, we began to talk about the issue of eating and shared some jokes about eating. The most thought-provoking thing was that those who were starving felt strange and uncomfortable when they saw others eating and smelled the aroma of food, even drooling! Suddenly, we passed a place where two people were arguing. Curious, we stopped to watch. Under their fists, there was a carrying pole on the road, with a rice basket full of empty rice buckets and many empty plates and bowls. In one bucket, there was some leftover rice, a plate of assorted cold dishes, and a bowl of mixed soup, all also leftover. One of the people arguing seemed to be an unemployed worker, and the other was a deaf-mute rice carrier. The worker said: "Give me your leftover rice to eat!" The deaf-mute made noises and gestured that he was unwilling, to the point of causing a fight. Such incidents of fighting for food are common in Shanghai. No matter which road, street, or alley you walk on, you will always encounter them every day. Alas! These (small bums)! I am truly saddened by these (small bums). Why don't they have food to eat? If it is because they are lazy and do not like to work, then starving to death is not a pity! But if they have lost their jobs due to unforeseen circumstances, then the people of society should show sympathy and assistance, so that the unemployed can find work again and the jobless can have jobs. Everyone has work to do and everyone has food to eat. Then, civilized Shanghai will truly live up to its name.</p>
<h3>Sights and Sounds of the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government, the colors of the blue sky and white sun flag are everywhere. All government walls, pillars, railings, and documents are decorated with these two colors. However, the blue color is often too thin and shallow. After exposure to wind and rain, it peels off before the year is out, which is detrimental to the view. Yet, no one has come forward to correct this. Is the azure sky its true color? Deep blue should be used for the blue sky, which is an idea that has been passed down for thousands of years. Only deep blue can represent the unique spirit of our country's culture. In my opinion, only the walls of Zhongshan Hall in the Central Park of the old capital are painted with stone blue, with white characters written on them, which is the most beautiful. However, elsewhere, pale blue is still used to decorate the red walls. The red color does not change, but the blue marks have fallen off, leaving a mottled and disgusting appearance. This is a blemish in the beautiful city. In the past, someone advocated changing all the yellow tiles and red walls of the palaces to blue and white. Coincidentally, a certain European artist was visiting this place and quickly announced to the public: "The palaces of Beijing use yellow tiles to match the blue sky and red walls to hide green trees. Every time the setting sun shines, they transform into strange colors. Only then do you know the精 of the ancients' design. This is the last remaining shadow of the old country's culture. Please do not destroy it. If you do not listen, then from now on, Westerners will turn back and not come here!" These words were echoed by those with knowledge. Fortunately, it was saved from disaster. Westerners living in the old capital love cultural relics even more than the people of the country. It can be said that scholarship and art have no national boundaries and do not mind overstepping their bounds. I also heard an artist make a further creative argument: "The beauty of the old capital does not lie in the yellow tiles and red walls, but in the color of the blue shirt." In the past, many people in the business community wore blue clothing. In recent years, both men and women in the middle and upper classes have adopted this style. Even if they wear Chinese clothing underneath, they must wear a blue shirt on the outside. The indigo cloth produced in the old capital has a deep and rich color that is well-suited to the environment of this ancient city. A kind of gentle and elegant style is enough to enhance the interest. Only those who are good at understanding things can make this argument. The number of students in schools in the old capital has increased sharply. Those who wear this are even more numerous. The streets are full of them. Recently, the fashion has spread to the south. O blue shirt, will it permanently represent the simple and elegant style of the ancient country?</p>
<h3>Gleanings from the Battlefield</h3>
<p>— Bao Zheng</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, there has been no shortage of young people who have abandoned their pens and joined the army, sacrificing themselves for justice. However, because they are unfamiliar with military affairs and have no experience, they are often flustered and at a loss in the face of battle. There was a Mr. Li who had been a coach at a national martial arts hall. He was skilled in boxing, proficient in combat, and strong and powerful. Hearing that the Japanese army had invaded Shanghai, he was furious and angry. He rushed to Shanghai overnight and joined the volunteer army, taking on logistical transportation. However, Mr. Li ultimately regretted not being able to go to the front line and personally kill the Japanese. After entering, the war became increasingly fierce. The Chinese army defending near Wusong was outnumbered and on the verge of being unable to hold out, but reinforcements had not arrived. The volunteer army was quickly mobilized and divided into various teams to join the battle and strengthen the momentum. Mr. Li then joined the machine gun team. Before long, he saw groups of three to five enemies advancing slowly. Mr. Li jumped ahead, pulled the trigger, and wanted to fire immediately. Two machine gunners in the same team quickly stopped him and said, "The enemy is not close yet. It is a waste of bullets to no avail." Mr. Li thought that they were deceiving him because he was an outsider and deliberately teasing him. He insisted that it was not allowed. While they were arguing, bullets flew like a string of pearls, grazing his neck. Mr. Li was shocked and fell into the trench, his face ashen. The two gunners laughed at the sight. They calmly and unhurriedly opened fire, and the enemy was indeed unable to succeed. Exhausted, they retreated. Looking back at Mr. Li, he was snoring loudly and had already fallen asleep.</p>
<h3>Writing the Chinese Language in Roman Letters</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Recently, the Soviet Russian Far East Education Association has adopted Roman letters to write the Chinese language. The Leningrad Academy of Sciences has already begun practicing this. This new method was invented by the Soviet Russian Chinese Language Society and Chinese scholars. Starting this year, all schools in the Maili province will use this method. Their purpose is to facilitate the general Korean and Chinese people living in Russia. At the same time, it can also enable the Chinese working class in Russia to study this pictographic writing and learn the Chinese language very easily.</p>
<h3>The Record of the Military Building (53)</h3>
<p>— By the Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Seeking Favors at the Gates of the Powerful Often Leads Generals to Fall; Imprisonment in the Jail of Love Can Ensnare Even a Husband</p>
<p>Everything that is destined to happen seems to have a chance every day to move up in the rankings. It's easy to be led up by the usher official. If it's not your turn, then you'll naturally be brushed off to the very end every time. Every day is just a wasted trip or a long wait. This time, I don't know which of those waiting will be out of luck. Military Governor Ye only saw guests for half an hour, and in total, he hasn't even met one-third of the large group waiting to be seen. Just after finishing a conversation with one guest for a few minutes and personally escorting him to the door of the reception room, that guy named Deshun walked to the door and whispered a few words into Military Governor Ye's ear. Military Governor Ye immediately went silent and walked straight out of the reception room, not even turning his head, and went with Deshun to the inner chamber. He left an usher official standing there, dumbfounded, with several name cards in his hand, not having had time to report or ask if he would see more guests today. Seeing that this official matter couldn't be explained, but the man was an experienced official after all. An idea struck him, and he ran outside, thinking it would be best to dismiss them all. The Fifth Madam invited them, surely there would be fun. He won't be seeing any more guests today. Let's talk about how Ye Zuozhang excitedly walked into the innermost of his residence, a very exquisite Chinese-style courtyard, and went straight to the Fifth Madam's inner chamber. Deshun closely followed, busily opening the doors and windows and announcing inside, "The commander is here!" But Ye Zuozhang had already rushed in, laughing and shouting wildly, "Haha! Is it Liang Xiaoyun, Old Eight, coming to see me? I'm happier than if I had won a great victory. Could it be that Old Eight's cautious heart has been moved, and she's finally willing to marry me?" At that time, Liang Xiaoyun was lying on a bed with the Fifth Madam, keeping watch over a lamp. When she saw Ye Zuozhang, she quickly stood up with a smile. Before she could answer, the Fifth Madam, lying on the bed with disheveled hair and unkempt appearance, wearing only a cheongsam and only a few buttons left fastened on the left side, revealing her tight-fitting vest underneath, remained motionless and rolled her eyes at Ye Zuozhang, saying, "Every time you come in, you're always shouting and yelling like this. I advise you to stop talking nonsense. She's already married and become Mrs. An." Ye Zuozhang deliberately acted surprised and said, "What? Old Eight is married? To someone named An? It doesn't seem like there's anyone with that surname among the well-known people nowadays. Is it that some young fellow is more handsome than this old roughneck, so I didn't have a chance?" As he spoke, he still squeezed towards Liang Xiaoyun with a playful smile.</p>

<h3>Official Style Writing, Part Two</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>In this world of gunboat diplomacy, justice and humanity have long been thrown into the vast ocean. In the September 18th Incident, the Japanese launched an unprovoked war and forcibly occupied our Eastern Provinces. In the January 28th Incident, our side had already agreed to the terms, but the Japanese side still bombarded us with artillery fire. What reason or principle can be discussed?</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Peiping yesterday, He Zhuguo informed the Japanese that if an unfortunate incident occurred at Guyuguan, the responsibility would lie with the Japanese side. Such a statement of responsibility seems correct, but dealing with the ruthless Japanese in this way seems inappropriate.</p>
<p>For example, if several robbers suddenly come to your home, would you politely say to them, "Gentlemen, you can rob as much as you like, but you must take responsibility for the robbery"? Anyone who heard this would laugh in disbelief.</p>
<p>This is also one of the styles of officialdom writing.</p>

<h3>The Lightless Searchlight</h3>
<p>— Jian Yinglou</p>
<p>The effectiveness of searchlights in military affairs is extremely significant. However, in the dim darkness or in dense fog, one cannot see even a short distance. A slight mistake can easily lead to falling prey to the enemy's ambush. Especially during naval battles with enemy ships and aerial battles with enemy aircraft, it is truly impossible to discern their true intentions. However, a major drawback of light searchlights is that they are often exploited by the enemy during wartime, who follow the light to find their way, turning them into targets for enemy fire. Therefore, military strategists generally regard this as a major regret regarding the practicality of searchlights. It wasn't until 1927 that a famous British scientist named Mr. Petre, after a long period of meticulous research, filled this gap and invented a lightless searchlight.</p>
<p>This type of searchlight, known in English as "Noctovisor," has a structural form that is not significantly different from ordinary searchlights. The only difference is that the emission of its light cannot be perceived by ordinary human vision. Its principle of invention is based entirely on using infrared rays from sunlight as its key element.</p>
<p>We all know that the sun's light band contains seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. According to optical scientists, there are also ultraviolet and infrared rays outside the violet and red light rays. These two types of rays cannot be seen by ordinary people. Ultraviolet rays have strong chemical effects, can be used to treat diseases, and can distinguish the authenticity of valuable objects.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been discovered that ultraviolet rays can be used in military applications for secret communication to transmit messages. Infrared rays, on the other hand, have very strong light power and are therefore also known as "heat rays." Their light waves are more than 160 times longer than the light waves of the longest red light rays. Mr. Petre utilized these infrared rays to successfully create his astonishing invention. He first manufactured a rubber-like light-gathering device and installed it in front of the lens of an ordinary searchlight to gather various light rays, allowing only infrared rays to be emitted. At the same time, he also utilized the effectiveness of the (photoelectric tube), an important tool in sound films and television technology, to present the objects being irradiated clearly before our eyes without missing a single detail.</p>
<p>The invention of this mysterious searchlight is truly enough to make military strategists around the world turn pale with astonishment. Recent testing has shown that the light transmittance of this lightless searchlight is more than 300 times stronger than that of ordinary searchlights. There is no obstacle even in heavy fog or dark nights. We can imagine that during combat, one side using this light, combined with observation and aiming devices such as the newly invented electrically linked observation device and the Vickers predictor, can ensure that every bullet hits its target, eliminating powerful enemies without them even realizing it. This invention of dangerous items increases the horror of future wars by an unknown amount.</p>
<p>Street Scenes and Alleyways</p>
<h3>Three Chinese Police Officers</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>｜Seen at the Jing'an Temple Fair　　The area in front of Jing'an Temple was packed with people, old and young, men and women, with varying degrees of joy on their faces; those coming and going, one after another, group after group.　　Suddenly, a Chinese police officer, grabbing a vendor by the collar, pushed through the crowd. The people with nothing to do conveniently stopped to watch.　　(Sir! We are all Chinese. Have pity on me, I'm just trying to make a small living!...) The vendor turned around and pleaded with the officer, tears almost falling from his eyes.　　(There's nothing to say, come to the police station, I don't care!)　　This (sir) finally raised his baton and dragged the offender away. Fortunately, an old woman sighed and said; (How pitiful!)　　And so, the people continued to crowd, one after another, group after group.　　I knew, this was a Chinese foreign police officer.　　× ×　　Next to the tram station was another crowd, tall and short, fat and thin, standing in a semi-circle. They were all facing the same direction, the tall ones stretching their necks, the short ones standing on tiptoe.　　A young man selling ditties from inside sang a rhythmic song, word by word, clear and distinct.　　(...XX people fart, Chinese people treat it like a green gas cannon, oh my god, that's terrible, lift your legs and run for your life! Run for your life, run for your life, the planes overhead are buzzing!...)　　(Good! Really well sung!) A chorus of cheers erupted from the crowd. Amidst this, the singer took the opportunity to sell a few copies of his songs. Then he sang again;　　(Jiangbei people, are not people, acting as traitors, killing their own Chinese. Oh my god...) The song suddenly stopped. Suddenly a Chinese police officer squeezed in, shouting; (Go, go, go!) waving his baton, raising his voice. So the singer ran away, and the crowd dispersed. Ah! How impressive. I think this is also a Chinese foreign police officer.　　× × ×　　At the intersection of Hart Road, there were still many people crowded together. Watching the excitement, buying cheap goods. The men bumped into the fragrant shoulders of the women, children darted between the adults' arms. He leaned on him, she leaned on her.　　An elderly Russian, carrying his knife-sharpening cart on his shoulder, walked from one side to the other, envious, his long eyebrows casting a greedy gaze. He stopped in front of a used clothing stall and refused to move. People had to squeeze under his cart. So a Chinese police officer patted him on the shoulder, smiled first, and then said amiably (Go!) But this foreigner turned around and immediately spat out a mouthful of saliva, cursing loudly;　　(Pig! Scoundrel! Why do you want me to run?);)　　However, this officer was truly generous, just smiling and walking away, his baton and pants hanging down together from under his clothes. So the White Russian cursed even more fiercely, but no one could hear clearly. At this time, it seemed that someone was saying;　　(Foreigners are powerful after all!) and someone else said;　　(Chinese police officers are like this.) Ah! This is also a Chinese foreign police officer.</p>

<h3>A Ninety Percent Gold Ring</h3>
<p>— City Dweller</p>
<p>The Shanghai society has many dark secrets. If you don't have life experience, you're guaranteed to be swindled. This is a story told by an experienced friend about dealing with con artists.</p>
<p>In the dim morning light, the road was as silent as death. Only he was hurrying along, when suddenly he heard hurried footsteps and voices behind him:</p>
<p>(Sir! This ring is ninety percent gold, buying it for four and a half dollars isn't expensive at all. To be honest; I'm going to:...) The person behind said. His attitude was very sincere, and as he spoke, he followed another person closely.</p>
<p>(Don't want it! Three dollars, not a penny more!), he ran even faster!</p>
<p>He knew that this kind of conversation was another scam, and he walked his own way without caring. But the footsteps became more urgent.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he heard running behind him, and then a ragged man came up beside him, holding a dazzling ring in his hand, and said solemnly,</p>
<p>(Sir! You can't get a ring like this for three dollars, right?) Sir, buy it, let's say four dollars, I'm not lying to you, I really need the money!) The expression on his face was even more earnest.</p>
<p>He replied confidently, (Oh! What a beautiful gold ring, but... I don't want it.)</p>
<p>(Sir, you might as well buy some cheap goods!) He eagerly hoped to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>He said lightly and casually: (Cheap goods? You can buy them for twenty cents at the City God Temple!)</p>
<p>The man heard this and darted into a narrow, dark alley!</p>
<p>Inexplicable</p>
<h3>Matching Couplets</h3>
<p>— Ming Zhi</p>
<p>Every day at two o'clock in the afternoon, I always hear the sound of the window across the way opening with a "creak," followed by someone sticking their head out, looking around up, down, left, and right. I don't know what they are inspecting. But in just that instant, their head retracts, and the window closes again with a "creak."</p>
<p>From then on, that crystal-clear glass window remains tightly closed, covered by a snow-white curtain. All day long, I never see it being opened. Even at night, under the bright electric lights, because of the curtain's cover, I can only vaguely sense that there is more than one or two people inside.</p>
<p>(The air in here must feel quite stuffy, right?) Every time I closely watch them open the window and then immediately close it again, I always have this thought.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I talk to the landlady about other things, from broad beans to mung bean sprouts to tiger stoves and dim sum shops. Driven by curiosity, I want to take the opportunity to find out what kind of person it is. So I asked her:</p>
<p>(Who lives in the building across the street?) I thought that since she had been living here for many years, she should know the details. But to my surprise, her first sentence made me very disappointed!</p>
<p>(Is it a man? Is it a woman?) She asked me instead. I had no choice but to truthfully offer her the information I had gathered.</p>
<p>(…) After listening quietly, she still hesitated and didn't express any opinion.</p>
<p>Spring! March! A flower blooms… She just nonchalantly followed my words and started singing a lullaby while walking back and forth with the child in her arms.</p>
<p>Naturally, I had no choice but to return upstairs without getting any information, holding a copy of the New Creation Monthly, staring blankly at the red cover, lost in fantasy.</p>
<p>But the white curtain in the glass window across the way still covered endless secrets.</p>

<h3>Quick Notes on a Quiz</h3>
<p>— Yinong</p>
<p>The merciless death knell rang relentlessly. Students, made nervous and frantic by the imminent triangular quiz, poured into the classroom as if drunk or mad, waiting respectfully for the examiner to arrive.</p>
<p>Two or three minutes later, the teacher stepped into the classroom. After distributing the exam papers, most of the students in the classroom were stunned by the questions.</p>
<p>(Chen! I can't do questions two, three, and five. Please Pass, Pass,) I felt my buttocks being gently kicked a few times by the student behind me, and at the same time, I heard these sound waves, as fine as a mosquito's buzzing. But since I usually do terribly in this subject, I barely have time to ask for help myself, how could I possibly help others? So, despite his repeated urgings, I could only reply with the words (We're in the same boat, I can't help you).</p>
<p>What a sharp-eared examiner! These sound waves, as fine as a mosquito's buzzing, actually prompted him to descend from his towering podium to stand in front of us and supervise. So we had no choice but to lower our heads and each seek our own way out.</p>
<p>After the exam, all the students gathered in the classroom as if they had been liberated, talking at length about their exam results.</p>
<p>Some said I was dizzy for a moment.</p>
<p>Some said I just didn't pay attention to this subject.</p>
<p>Some said I was lucky that I did one subject not badly.</p>
<p>Some said this old man is really trying to make things difficult for us by setting such hard questions.</p>
<p>Living Like a Dream</p>
<h3>END</h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>The black gauze of night gradually enveloped everything.</p>
<p>In front of the brightly lit cinema, with its melodious songs, men and women, reds and greens, the fragrance of powder, the seduction of colors, the trembling of flesh, everything was filled with joy and pleasure, everything showed the enjoyment and happiness of the upper class.</p>
<p>Here, people seemed to be swimming in a sea of (peace).</p>
<p>How long ago was it that we could hear the sound of cannons booming in the same place, and we could imagine the soldiers fighting bravely in bloody battles for the glory of the nation. But this has already passed like a dream, vanished like smoke. What is presented before us is a peaceful world, all the heroic and tragic shadows washed clean by blood and tears.</p>
<p>Inside the theater, the movie scenes were projected one after another, people poured in from the outside and squeezed out from the inside.</p>
<p>Peace, peace… everything is peace. If our brothers and sisters were to think one day that our motherland might also be like a movie, reaching the (END), I wonder if we would still be able to see (Please come again next time)?</p>
<h3>Postal Rates Increased</h3>
<p>— Yang Fan</p>
<p>▲ Post Office Loses Money Sorting Letters</p>
<p>There is no reason for this postal rate increase. At the very least, we can say that the reasons for this postal rate increase are insufficient.</p>
<p>However, the government's decree has already been promulgated. From the perspective of postal workers and their position, they can only obey orders. But the government, due to public opposition, has made a compromise decision, which has left letter writers wandering in confusion. Should they put on four cents? Five cents? Or six cents?</p>
<p>Therefore, many people, because their letters are not important and they want to use the power of the people to achieve the goal of canceling the price increase, only put on four cents. Many people, because their letters are very important, such as love letters, requests for money, or demands for debt, generously put on six cents to ensure that they will not be lost or delayed in transit. There are also some people who think that putting on four cents might cause trouble for the recipient, but they are unwilling to suffer extra losses by putting on six cents, so they adopt a compromise approach and put on five cents, which could be considered as complying with the government's new decision.</p>
<p>However, the difficulty finally arrived. In the thousands of bags of letters that the post office carries in and out every day, there are stamps of unequal amounts with mutual differences. Because the postal authorities have not received</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>a new order, they can only continue to implement the price increase order. But the existing personnel are obviously not sufficient to carry out these procedures of punishment, underpayment, etc. So they hired sixteen more people to help with the work.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a postal worker complained to me,</p>
<p>This kind of sorting is really a loss-making business. Think about it, hiring sixteen more people, calculated at fifty yuan per person per month, already costs eight hundred yuan. But the amount of underpaid letters received each month is at most five hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Finally, he said,</p>
<p>Currently, underpaid letters account for two-tenths of the total, but we are already extremely busy.</p>
<h3>Movies</h3>
