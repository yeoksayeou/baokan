<p>時評</p>
<h3>中德友誼之增進　微</h3>
<p>—歡迎慕爾夫人—！　　旅德美僑慕爾夫人此次代表德國各界民衆。隨帶贈禮樣品。來滬慰問吾國前此力抗强暴之十九路軍。其所發表之談話。除稱頌吾國將士之忠勇戰精傅逹德國民衆之深摯同情以外。又謂「歐美各國之人民。一部分固對華頗具同情然大半則因情况隔膜之故。未能確切認識中國。被在日内瓦時所。</p>
<p>耹中國之消息多爲某方散佈之惡意宣傅。中國對此亦應有以補救」此誠友邦人士所鍚之良箴。爲國人所宜服膺者也。</p>
<p>歐美人士對於遠東情况。認識不足。實爲解决中日紛爭之極大障礙。惟其認識不足。故對於日本侵略的戰争。猶認爲自衛的手段。惟其認識不足。故對於日本强佔的利權猶認爲特殊的權益又惟其認不足故日人乃得利用其弱點而作種種惡意失實之宣傅。致是非曲直。莫由剖析。各國民衆。旣受其蒙蔽。又寗能望其對我有切實之援助乎。</p>
<p>日本自東北事件發生以來。在國際上之宣傅。可謂無微不至外交人員之來往奔走。通信電稿之紛遞雜投。固無待言。而最近如松岡洋右之使日内瓦則幾專爲謗毁我國國政掩飾本國暴行而派遣者。雖熟悉遠東形勢之各國政治家或尚不至受其愚弄。然一般認識不足之歐美人士。則勢必濟移默化。無形中堕入其彀中矣。</p>
<p>宣傅可以轉移國際之視聽。獲得友邦之同情。其關係之重大。何待煩言。然而默察我國上下。則似不甚注意及此。猶憶去年九一八事件發生時。我國駐英日美各國之使命且未派定。或未到任。遑論其他。事件發生以後。已逾一年。亦未聞有若何對外宣傅之切實方法。使歐美列强深悉彼日本之暴行。使各國民衆。認識我中國之情形。何怪邦人士對於中國情况隔膜。又何怪日方乘間作種種惡意宣傅。以淆惑世界之觀聽哉。</p>
<p>國際聨盟調查圑之東來。雖亦爲求明確認識遠東形勢而派遣然因其爲國際的組織。未免受各方面之牽制且調查時期不過六月所得能有幾何。其報告書之未满人望不能解决東北問題蓋亦當然之事故今如吾人不希求世界公正之輿論則已。否則非設法先使全世界民衆對吾中國有明確之認識。有深摰之同情不可。蓋惟各國民衆有明確之認。識始能有世界公正之輿論可期也。</p>
<p>欲使各國民衆有明確之認識。第一吾人必須對外有廣大之宣傳慕爾夫人則謂「中國現有極大之無綫電台。應早向日内瓦通報傅遞一切最近消息。」即其一端。其二則爲多派外交人員。至各國從事大規模之宣傅運動。聞施肇基孔祥熙與李錦綸現已在美京恊同使署人員積極活動。此亦爲重要之工作。吾人希望此種工作能推廣及於各國。則收效當可更大也。　　宣傳工作有極大之功效。固矣。然吾人應知所宜宣傅者。决不爲向壁虚搆之空言。而應爲從事實産生之材料。前次十九路軍之抗日與夫最近東北義勇軍之活動。皆爲我國抗禦外侮擁護正義之事實最足以吸引各國人士之同情。故吾人之宣傅。若以此種事實爲主。則易使各國明瞭日人侵路政策之眞相。必可增加各各國八士對於遠東形勢之認識程度也。</p>
<p>然而十九路軍之戰績與夫東北義勇軍之苦鬥皆爲我國民氣發揚之表現。由是吾人更知欲獲得各國人士之同情。仍非吾人自行努力。堅决奮鬥不可。若事事遷就。始終不用實力抵抗　叅苟存。則徒貽笑外。人又焉望他人之同情於我哉。</p>
<p>德國與我。同爲受外鄰壓迫之國家。其人民對我之同情。自較他國更爲深摰吾人對於慕爾夫人代表德國人民慰問我十九路軍之熱誠。謹表深切之謝意。並祝中德二國民衆友誼之增進。</p>

<p>哈瓦斯社東京通信近來驚人之謡　雖傳播各處、然數星期來俄日關係似已大有改善之象、據消息靈通之各方面傅聞日本與蘇聨間之戰争、似已迫不及待、有九月杪前爆發之可能、據謂此戰争將出自俄國方面之發動、蓋满洲入冬酷寒日軍必遭困難、俄國實欲利用此時機、以對日開戰也、日本海陸軍兵工廠之活動、軍用材料之大批定造、對於某種事件之禁止報紙登載以用風聞所謂「满洲國政府」致蘇聨之哀的美敦書、凡此殆爲謡諑所由來之原因、日本軍事準備之正在猛進、誠屬確實、然此種軍事準備尚不足以供立即開始戰爭之需、要至謂此種準備乃係對蘇俄而作、則尤不足以置信軍械之、動工定製似可以下列各種需要説明之即（一）補充東省及上海戰鬥中所消耗之軍火儲藏、（二）增加軍備、（如飛機炸彈步兵砲運送汽車及汽車等）俾向東省及熱河之義勇軍作更猛烈之鬥爭（三）預先準備、以防與中俄美發生糾纷時之意外事變、（四）使日本國家主義派及軍閥之要求得以满意、日本之對满政策、固已成竹在胸、同時對於列强之一舉一動、復随時謀應付之策、此外吾人常聞熱河之併入满洲爲保護满洲、避免中國侵八之所必不可缺、蓋以熱河一帶崇山峻嶺、爲满洲與中國其餘部分間天然屏障也、故僅佔領熱河一事、已不免引起新戰争與新糾纷、而足以成爲軍事準備之理由目下日本人民雖持鎭静之態度然對於承認「满洲國」以後、美國國聨與俄國方面不免發生反響、因而張皇其事者實繁有徒、不問日本將與何國開戰、而目前日本之正在準備戰争、則誠如以上之所述、然被侵略之憂慮一旦消失、代之以經濟困難之憂慮則此種備戰之狂熱或亦一旦消失、固大有其可能陸軍方面一般傾向、多視蘇聨爲其危險之對象、蓋著名之五年計書完成以後、蘇聨國力必且大增、故一般意見如日俄戰爭已不可避免、則當於蘇俄工業設備未完竣以前爲之並以反共之理由、求得美國之援助、海軍方面之意見、則適與此相反、均以美國爲假想之敵人、且寗願與蘇聨獲得暫時之諒解、據海軍界之推測日美戰爭將必不免、愈早則愈有利於日本、蓋日本海軍之優勢、方日益削减、倫敦海軍條約之結果至一九三六年則日本海軍將全失其優勢也、再陸海軍界對於單獨向蘇俄或美國開戰、認爲有利於日本、如萬一美俄聨合以對日、則又不免於憂慮矣、</p>

<p>路透社七日柏林電德國覆文已接受大不列願請參加四國會議之來文、此説已由消息靈通各界徵實、惟聞得國曾聲明、必對德國軍備均等主張作完全客觀之研究、而後會議始能獲有效果云、外交界現暗示德政府將保留於會議召集時詳細聲明其對此事意見之權、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社八日柏林電　德國對於英政府邀請列席五强會議之覆文、據可持消息、内容節要如下、覆文開端、德政府宣言謂德國準備參加公開談判、並願與英法意美列强忠誠合作、以謀裁軍問題之適當解决、德國並宣稱英政府所提議之談判、應與洛桑會議最後宣言之文字精神相符合該宣言説明、除在洛桑業經解决之財政問題外其他問題則當依照建立新局面、並可恢復各民族間信任之願望、以謀解决、德國政府要求倫敦會議應以此種方式爲出發點而不當以英法政府拒絶德國軍備均等所發表之備忘錄、爲討論有效果、之根據、德政府繼又表示、希望英政府預備召集之五强會議能産出一種結果使德國得重行列席軍縮大會、蓋德國始終期望軍縮大會之能獲得實際結果也、最後德政府建議倫敦會議日期應較原定者稍缓、德國覆文中謂在十月十一日之日期、國際聨合會大會尚未閉幕、勢將妨礙倫敦會議之工作云、德國照會用打字機繕成共約二頁、除英國已邀請之各國外、其他各國應否參加倫敦會議之問題、則在照會内略爲提及、并未提出具體辦法、德政府僅公佈覆文之節要照會全文將不公佈、</p>

<p>北平這地方、就性質上加以分析、是政治區域·軍事區域·文化區域區域的集合體、在民國十七年六月以前、北京是中國的首都、是全國第一政治區域、後來首都南遷、北平在中國政治上已失去了重要性、雖然至今運設有政務委員會、爲華北各地的政治中心、澈底説來此項政務委員會、並没　設在北平的必要、爲交通便利呼應　通計、天津運比北平好、其所以設在北平者、只是因爲有空閑的房子可以借用再加一般人七對於北平在已往政治史上的重要、遷有相當的後念、所以仍要認爲一個次要的政治區　、以資點從、北平之爲軍事區域、是跟着政治區域來的從前中央政府旣然設在此地、自然就該有相當的軍事設備、所謂「拱衛京師」無論在事實上、或在國家的體制上、都是需要的、但北平本身是二向開議地、不能設置要塞、并没有軍事上的重要性、民國四年、日本提出二十一條的時候、北京政府曾命參謀本部會同陸海軍部、　請中外軍事專家、開過一個國防會議、並南各專家親往輪開古北口·南口等處、實地調查、結果認爲一旦中日有事、除東三省及沿　各省不計外、專論華北方面、第一鎭防綫、應在榆關、若榆關不能守、平津也一定不能守、所以華北重鎭、應在保定、而以熱河之承德與察哈爾之張家口爲副點、北平之所以能爲文化區域、自然也是跟着政治區域來的、要是北平没有能做近數百年來的中國首都、没有能把全中國的人才經濟集中於一處、而加以極度的經營、恐怕今日的北平、不過同河北普通各縣的縣城一樣、至多也不過和保定一樣罷了、現在我們所要研究問題是這樣、北平之爲政治區域、現在已到了無足輕重的時候、其軍事文化南區域、還是應當並行存在呢、還是應當有所側重呢、據我們想、軍事區域與文化區域、是不能並立在一處的、一個地方旣做軍事區域、就不得不預備打仗、而文化區域是經不得打仗的、所以要注重軍事、就得把種種文化設備挪開、那麽、究竟挪開那一個好呢、且讓我們平心静氣來研究一下</p>
<p>第一、如前文所説、北平之爲政治區域、已到了無足經重的時侯、那就是説、設在北平也好、不設在北平也好、卽使設在北平、也與從前的中央政府不同、並没有設兵拱衛的必要</p>
<p>第二、北平雖説是個軍事區域、賞際即並没有什麽固定軍事設備、只是駐了些兵、而這些兵也並不是固定的、並不是對於防守北平、或維持北平治安受遇特别訓練的、乃是跟了　際的執政者來來去去的、嚴格説來、只是執政者的衛隊而已、而這些執政者的實力也就並不在北平城裏這一些兵上到了其他方面的路走不通的時侯、雖然北平還留着一些兵、也就無用處、這是就已往的事實可以證明的</p>
<p>第三、北平本身並没有軍事上的重要性、已如前文所述、而且現在的飛機作戰、日趨嚴酷、在未正式衝突之前、敵人必先以飛機謀炸我後方總司令部、及各種倉庫、以爲搖軍心計、就這一點　觀察、北平的目標實在太大、所以設軍事區域於北平、在國防上非但無益、而且有害、</p>
<p>第四、有開文化的品物、搜　起來是很難、散失起來却是很容易的、散失的重要原因、其一是兵亂、第二就是遷移</p>
<p>第五、有開文化的建築物、是搬挪不動的、</p>
<p>第六、因爲北平有種種文化設備所以全國各種學問的專門學者、大多薈萃在北平、造成一個代表國家文明、在國際上爲國家爭得榮誉的文化氣侯、這種氣候、並不是一朝一夕所能養成的、一旦把北平所有種種文化設備都挪開、這些學者們當然不免要随着星散若要在别處冉造成這樣一個文化氣侯、恐怕不是件容易事</p>
<p>以上六項理由、前三項説明把北平的軍事設備挪開、在國防上是有利而無弊、在事實上也並没有什麽因難、後三項説明、若要把北平的文化設備挪開不但事實上不可能、而目無異於要把數百年所養成的文化氣候、一旦消減、因此、我們主張要請求政府明定北平爲文化城、將一切軍事設備、挪往保定、北平的治安、警察擔負完全責任、向來担負維持地方治安責任的、雖然以軍警並舉、實際上、恐怕　是警察的力量居多、軍隊不過處於很微弱的　助地值而已、我們的目的、是要借此减除北平城　各種文化設備遭受砲火打聲的可能、當然、敵人的道德是應當顧慮的亦許我們撤除了軍事設備而敵人仍不免造出種種誣陷的話來、以圖破壞北平的文化、這在我們自然也無法可想、但北平爲名國使節所在之地、我們不妨姑目假定、世界上還未必有這樣一個　大而野蠻的民族、敢在衆目昭彰之下向浸有抵抗的文化設備、如以破壞、所以我們儘可以先盡其在我、北平所有的文化品物、如孔　所藏的石鼓、中央研究院歴史語言研究所所藏的殷商甲骨、西北科學考查圑所　的人宗漢代木簡北京大學所藏大福元代壁盡北平圖書館所藏的四庫全書、燉煌經卷、及其他善本書　、天壇皇穹宇所藏語朝祭天國樂　、都是在中國文化史上、推而矣於在世界文化史上、具有無上價値的珍品眞可當得國寳的稱號、至於故宮和古物陳列所的建築、以及所藏寳物、尤其是全世界各國博物院所仰望不到的、就是各大學及各研究所的義器　本雖然比不上外國大學、却還比國内其他各處的大學及研究所完備得許多、這些東四淺一層説足以表揚國光、深一層説是國家命腺國家精神寄託之所在、其重要並不在所値金錢之多而在大部分是一毁之後、統無從購置、金錢的價値是無從計算的我們在國　中、雖然人人部具有什麽　可以犧牲的决心、而這國表揚國光寄付首國家命脉、國民精神的文化品物却是斷斷不可以犧牲的要是　這種東西都　犧牲試問我們犧牲了一切所爭者果是何物、我們希望將來的北平、像　洲的瑞士一樣、永遠不到爭的駐投、像英國的牛津　橋兩處、樣永遠沉浸於文化的清泉之中、我們希望　的政府接受我們的要求、更希望識見宏遠的軍事當局、切實贊助我們、我們希望世界各國、愛護和平愛護文化的政治家與舉者給我們適當的　携、　我們證明一切（六日）</p>

<h3>開採陜煤的途徑</h3>
<p>鑛學家黄伯逹君於考察陜北煤田終了後、對於開採陜煤的途徑、有後列之意見</p>
<p>予（黄君自稱）此次代表中華鑛學社參加陜西實業考察圑、足跡歴十餘縣、行程凡二千餘里、其概况及意見、略述如下（一）考察各鑛爲同官縣之新村溝灰推坡白公廟陳家河各鑛、宜君縣之要險村、　家溝張家溝七里鎭厚子坪等鑛韓、城縣之竹園石家溝泉予溝兒溝西溝等鑛、（二）煤價調查、西安一帶煤價奇昂西安煤價每噸約四十餘元、據建設聽量云、最貴時每噸曾至二百元、茲將其他各縣之煤價列表如後</p>
<p>西安　　四四·二元　　　縣　　一○·二元咸陽　　四四·二元　　膚施　　一○·二元三原　　二四·六五元　延長　　一一·九元耀縣　　八·五元　　宜川　　二八·九元宜君　　八·五元　　贑城　　一○·二元中部　　九·三五元　　邰陽　　一四元洛川　　一一·九元</p>
<p>（三）煤量約計據一般約計、以煤層厚度按四五六公尺計算、似過於　險、予此次調查宜君煤層厚由四尺至八尺不等、平均可按二公尺計算、同官煤層厚由六尺至八尺、可按二公尺計算、韓城煤層厚可一公六尺計算、惟忽怱一過、各處煤田走向傾斜廣寬等未能測知、茲據趨國賓君記　、而得其煤量約况於次</p>
<p>（甲）宣君煤田、南北長約四萬公尺、東西寬約三千公尺、煤層厚度約二公尺、假定比重爲一、應含煤量二萬四千萬噸、（乙）同官煤田、長約七萬二千公尺、寬約四千八百公尺、煤層厚度頗不一致、今以二公尺計算、假定比重爲一、應含煤量約三萬四千萬噸、（丙）韓城煤田、長約六千公尺、廣約一萬二千公尺、煤層厚度以一·六公尺計、比重一應含煤量約十一萬五千噸、以上三處之煤、共約十七萬三千萬噸、（了）　縣膚施延長等縣侏羅煤層、厚在二尺左右、當地人民、用土開採、有能獲利者、凡取諸地下、銷於市塲而能獲利之鑛、卽有開採價値、以故　縣膚施延長等處煤　、吾人似不可以絶對的無價値目之煤量因長寬不詳、未能估計</p>
<p>（四）煤責原因、西安三　等處煤價奇昂之原因、純爲運輸困難之關係、而非採煤成本特高之故、查各鐀在鑛地之售價、每噸約二元左右如韓城宜君等是、最高者亦不過四元左右、如同官陳家河等、採煤成本、在同官約二元左右、宜君韓城約一元至二元之可見採煤成本並不特高最因難者爲運輸、産煤之地、大半山嶺重叠、轉運利用牲口　韓城煤鑛並利用黄河運煤、略况如下、（甲）由鑛山運至萬門口十五里、默運每噸二·八元（每默二百四十斤費洋四角）、由禺門口至滴開水運、每噸八·四元（每默一·二元）、共計每噸運費自鑛山至混關爲十一元二角、（乙）由鑛山平禺門口每噸默費二元八角、由禺門口至白楊寨、每噸水脚十二元六角由白楊寨至西安每噸默費十六元八角、共計自鑛山至西安之運費爲三十二元二角、觀此、可見陜北煤田之不能發展、純係運費問題而非採煤費之過高也</p>
<p>（五）開發之途徑、陜北盆地、中心及邉緣均産煤、侏羅纪煤層在地盆中心、煤層厚薄變遷甚入中間負岩頗多、故灰份特高硫磺亦重、如宜君煤鑛是、石炭二　纪煤層、在此盆地邊緣、煤層平均厚度約在二公尺左右、煤質頗佳、煤層上下岩石均爲砂岩、使用撑木之處甚少、如同官韓城是、如欲開發陜西煤田、似以先開同官及韓城煤鑛爲有利、韓城距潼開二百四十五里、可經　海路外銷距羣　約二百七八十里、該地已有兵工　、設以華陰爲工業區、銷耗煤炭、當不在少數沿途經過之邰陽大荔朝邑等縣、居民年約烧煤十萬順左右将來於山嶺重叠之地、宜築高線議路運送、平地可築輕便　道、同官至咸　二百四五十里、咸陽爲　海預定路線經過之地、可以外運、設以咸陽爲工業區、亦可　大宗煤炭、惟由咸陽向東運售、較之華陰、每噸须加運費一元餘、而一部分原料之輸入、及出品之向東輸出者、其運費亦必較華陰爲高、故予以爲如以華陰爲工業區、似較咸陽爲便利、著指定華陰爲工業費、則贑城煤田之開發、然當在同官之先、至煤層之廣開及運輸之方法、尚須群加研究、有主張利用黄河運輸者、查黄河河床變遷無定、運費奇昂、似無利用之價　也、（九月十三日自邰寄陽）</p>
<h3>中秋不見月光明</h3>
<p>老天好像女人一般的　　、到了十三日那天早</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>我們要從邰陽動身有時候、又姗姗地下起雨來、七時我們在　下雨絲中進食、八時至十時、和邰陽當地各界交換意見、十時至十二時、我們大家出席歡迎會、下午一時左右、午餐旣畢、我們便帶着雨具、向着露井鎭出發、</p>
<p>那天的行程、只有四十里、我們乘馬者、於二小時後、卽已到達、那時雨已停止、不過空中陰雲四布老天還是扳着面孔、好像有什麽不痛快的事情、要發洩出來、露井鎭雖然是一個鎭、但是四　有堅固的城牆、城内也有好幾家商舖、規模和小的縣洽不相上下、那夜我們抬頭一望、在昏黑的太空中、找不見將到中秋的皓月、本來中秋之月、分外光明、不知那個今年掃着月姊兒的豪興、掩没了她的皎潔豔麗的面容、不使和我們苦寂的旅客們相見呀、</p>
<p>十四日的早晨、天空中還是滿布着雨絲、帶着冷味的朔風對着夾　的後面吹來、使我們覺得不但凉秋九月之將過、而知嚴冬的也是一步步緊緊趕來了十一時、我們從露井鎭到了方泉鎭、鎭中於虎疫盛時、遭疫難而死者很多、我們在休息進食的時候、眼看着羣蠅像黑雲一般的停在食物上、欲求虎疫之不猖獗、眞不可能、那時雨已停止、氣候亦稍轉暖我們乘馬者、於十二時半左右、各各拼命的前進於二小時内、跑完了四十里的路程、而到了我們最後考察的一個區域、就是大荔縣、</p>
<p>大荔卽曩昔的同州、市街很是繁盛、每逢月之三七等日、便是商業上的集會之期、而中秋節的十四十五十六三天、尤爲一年中賣買最熱鬧的時期我們進城的時候、看見街中人山人海擁擠不堪、而二三寸小足的摩豋女叛徒、凌波微波的在街中走着、幾乎使我們疑惑着十八世紀的行將復活了、據當地人云、全縣面積約有六千多頃、城的周圍約有九里許東西稍長而南北窄、人口全縣約有十萬人、城内約有一萬二千人、商店約有二三百家、我於到達宿所時、遇見了敎育局長李郁華、財政局長李保卿、建設局長高天民等</p>

<h3>西人會甲組賽曁南初賽大利</h3>
<p>十一比零勝英海軍</p>
<p>江陳二氏勞苦功高</p>
<p>西人足球會甲組賽、昨日曁南初次出塲遇英海軍於逸園九十分鐘比賽結果、曁南鐵蹄所趨、任甩欲爲、凈勝十一球、凱旋而歸、</p>
<p>實力相差天壤</p>
<p>曁南三軍矯健、堪稱强敵、他日丘東炎來歸、内衛當益可觀、昨日對方過弱竟成一面倒局勢、中衛綫之進退攻守、極盡能事、前鋒頗見鋭利、惟時犯混亂之誤、江善敬大刀闊斧之脚頭、陳鎭和生龍活虎之身材、最爲觀衆欣賞、英海軍中、幾難覓一較佳之人才、有之惟守達　斯耳、</p>
<p>五球連珠而下</p>
<p>三時裁判員福爾特、抱球入場、銀角一鳴、曁南背日佈陣、開始向英軍攻擊、小黑炭撥球交羅海光、被阻於克來蓀、乃急以短遞於劉祖侃、劉行未數式、爲凱來追回、敵中鋒白郎、帶球向曁南防地來衝、徐亞輝半途殺出、得球卽交洪寳、沿邊直入敵陣腹地、遠遠傳來、羅海光趕上一脚、由門柱彈回、小黑炭候之於右舉足待射、白而姆奔來相擾、陳鎭祥得隙打門、應聲入網、未三分鐘陳鎭祥盤球被刦梁樹棠搶回來球’遠交海光、羅在敵人三面堅視之下乃以美妙之傳遞法挑過敵之後衛線小黑炭快如奔馬、白克兩騎阻攔不得、達維斯束手待縛、於是曁南又得一球、詎開球未兩鐘、劉祖侃在低線勾來一球、輪送中央、陳鎭祥低頭一順球又入門由此以後、曁南氣𦦨萬丈、所向無敵、徐亞輝一馬擋雙車�</p>
<p>縱身頂球落於梅洪寳之側於是敵人腹地、又見曁南之鐵騎、左衝右突、敵人招架困難、陣鎭祥飛起一脚、球在達維斯手中拍出、羅海光不前不後、趕上開弓又中紅鵠、敵連失四球、氣己大娞、士無鬭志、東南半壁、幾爲我國健兒踏碎、劉祖侃　放回馬槍、小黑炭亦善當頭砲、球被克來蓀以頭碰出丈餘、而羅海光與白而姆兩脚並發、砰然一聲球被激入敵門、上半時五對一比、</p>
<p>半打一氣呵成</p>
<p>攻檬旣罷、再决雌雄、英軍仍萎靡不振、旣無反攻力量、復乏防守技能、陳鎭和得徐亞輝接濟、闖過三關敵人環困四週、炭史乖覺、乃以脚尖挑球送於左翼、劉祖侃横身一掃敵關又告失陷、未過三分、陳鎭和又在敵守門員手中、刦下來球銜入網底未幾梅洪實主罰角球、落點極佳陳鎭祥候個正着、球從敵守將肩頭滑入、開球未頃、梅洪寳復主罰角球、仍爲鎭祥攻入、細綜比數已足驚人、不圖劉祖侃陳鎭和仍未饒人、繼復和得一球、英軍遂以○對十一狼狽而歸、附兩隊陣綫如下、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>九三老人馬相伯語録</p>
<h3>詩文和酒</h3>
<p>— 景紀</p>
<p>現在雜記一些關於詩，文，和酒的談話。</p>
<p>（A）詩</p>
<p>相老人説：中國詩，寫景還勉强：談義理便不如希臘臘丁的名家作品了。韓昌黎的詩，描寫火景，便用許多表示「紅光」的字，倒也很有趣的！蔣士銓的勇敢，真可佩服他一次咏朝買的詩中，竟公然直書「天主降生」若干年即康熙某年。因爲現在祇通行書所謂「公曆」呢！</p>
<p>（B）文</p>
<p>相老人説：中國文人的態度，應該多加修養工夫。因爲</p>
<p>愛聽人恭維他；若是有人説他一句壞語，立刻把以前恭維他時所表示的自謙態度，便完全底改變了！甚至於一語不合，大打其筆墨官司；如曾文正文集中就有這一類的文字。究竟，各人所見不同，何必反唇相議？譬如：我今天看花，説紅的好；明天再看，又説綠好：一個人自己的見解，早晚還有不同！態呌所謂英雄自命的文豪，都拜倒我一人的門下麽？我想，這種態度，大可不必！</p>
<p>（C）酒</p>
<p>相老人在會餐時，常勸我們，飲少許酒，説了很可以助詩文的興：因爲那恍恍惚惚的酒意，正合那文學中所謂想像的神情，並舉許多文豪詩家的故事作證。自然，並没有勸人過量狂飲的！</p>
<h3>糖葫蘆</h3>
<p>— 鐵菴</p>
<p>故都聞見之一</p>
<p>北都承蒙古遺風，頗嗜酥酪之食。世説載南人至北，不愼乳酪，則其來亦久矣。今通街間有奶茶舖，即專售此類食品者，所製奶餅，味酢而臭膻，北人以爲珍味，而南人多見之蹙額，蓋南北食性之殊，亘數千年未能融貫。明因元俗，食品尙多采自裏外，宸垣識略云：前明冬至賜百官甜食一盒，凡七種：一松子海哩𠿨，鄭以偉曰：𠿨字諸字書汪載，今亦�</p>
<p>不識海哩𠿨爲何物，蓋緣元人語也。又戒庵漫�</p>
<p>筆載前明四月八日賜百官午門外食不落夾，不落夾者，亦元人語，或云棕子，或云卽今餑餑字，似尤近之。餑餑者，乃麥食之通稱也。至如滿洲食品，今猶盛行者，則薩齊瑪是，其物以冰糖奶油合白麵爲之，形如糯米，用石灰木烘爐烤熱，遂成方塊，甜腻可食。芙蓉糕與薩齊瑪同，但面有紅糖，　如芙蓉耳。是二者，皆無潼酪之味，雖南人亦克欣賞。然吾以爲價廉而味雋者：尤莫如氷糖葫蘆，法以竹簽貫蒲陶山藥海棠果山裏紅勃　胡桃等物，醮以冰糖，甜脆而凉，冬夜食之，　能爽口。北方冬季非盛熾鑪火不暖，故宜常食凉物，以潤心肺。其在關外，則恒啖西瓜，都中多以生　葡代之。，潔白多汁，冷沁藏府，雖貧人皆得飫其味。</p>
<p>兩樣應時食品</p>
<h3>桂花栗子</h3>
<p>— 洪流</p>
<p>桂花栗子，產在常熱盧山，食時有桂花香味，故名。一説真種已絶，現在市面出售者，皆係　鼎，故香亦遠遜。至於真種何以絶滅？據故老傳述：當時有　紳先生，致仕家居，當桂花栗子而嘆之，以爲人間尤物；又其產絶少，恐傳之上苑，來按歲賁賁之煩，官家摇役，非民所堪；乃盡購其樹，悉斬伐之，以杜後患。原種絲此遂絶云。前年見宗子威先生詩，亦咏茲事，或其確也。名種不傳，惜哉！</p>
<h3>紅丁　　舞霜</h3>
<p>爲秋日之佳饌，味極鮮美，然多有毒者。凡具嬌艷之色，遇日光變色，銀類變黑者，皆不可食。輩之供食，宋代已然，放翁詩云：「密封小　餉紅丁」，紅丁者，　也。丁爲像形，而　之呈紅色者多有　，豈宋人食　　而無害乎。</p>
<h3>家庭食事衛生法</h3>
<p>— 曹寄儈</p>
<p>須防病從口入</p>
<p>語云，百病從口入，此言雖不盡符醫理，然一般消化器疾病，實半多食物所誘致。茲請　家庭最簡單之食事衛生法，以貢獻國人，倘能連行，未始不可防止疾病於無形也。　　（一）煮沸食具，食時所用之　，匙，碗，碟，等物，固宜洗滌淸潔，而於臨食時，更須置簽中煮沸十分鐘，所以殺附箸之黴菌類也。</p>
<p>（二）煮熟食物無論何種食物，必須充分煮沸，迫其十分熟透，方可進食，否則每易貽患，而以肉類食物爲尤甚。（因往往有寄生虫在内）故一切煎炒肉類，曁生浸魚蝦蟹等，皆不可進。</p>
<p>（三）庖人淸潔凡烹調食物者，無論男女，皆當令其嚴守淸潔，如常洗滌衣服與圍裙，常剪去指甲，常滌除手垢等是，所以防細菌棲息其中也。</p>
<p>（四）陳食屏棄一切食物，皆以隨烹隨食爲宜，如不得已，而有剩餘，亦必須十分煮沸，方可進食，倘剩餘食物，已具臭味，是爲有細菌之證，卽加煮沸，亦不能進。蓋以煮沸縱能殺菌，而死菌之毒藥，間或存在，猶可爲害，故孔子有色惡不食，臭惡不食之語，亦屏棄陳食之意也。</p>
<p>（五）蠅類驅除蠅類，爲細菌絶妙之傳播器；食物亦細菌之良好培養基。故蠅類一接觸食物，卽不免細菌，且防範較難，惟設法以驅除之，最妙。</p>
<h3>豆腐小食譜</h3>
<p>— 鏡如</p>
<p>好滋味</p>
<p>豆腐爲我國普通之食品，西人推爲最富於滋養者。其作法變人盡知之，勿庸　述。本腐所詳，僅及其烹調之法。</p>
<p>（一）漿豆腐分甜鹹兩種，作法極簡單。甜者以代漿之豆腐，和以糖卽成。淸晨食之最宜。鹹者去漿加以醬油，再加香油（卽芝麻油）少許卽成。用以佐飯甚佳。或再加　末少許亦可。（按南人惡　如仇，蓋　其口臭也。殊不知少食之，則甚合衛生，有避疫祛　之功。食後用淸水潄口，再以茶葉一撮含於口内，其臭自消。）</p>
<p>（二）炒豆腐先以肉絲於釜内炒之，加以　當之作料，然後含豆腐同炒之卽成。</p>
<p>（三）鷄肺豆腐先用鷄肺刴碎，以蛋白調和之使匀，然後用香油於菳内炒之，加以適當之作料，再將豆腐攪碎合炒之卽成。味頗甘芳。</p>
<p>（四）會豆腐先將淸湯於釜内煮之使沸，加以作料，然後將豆腐及閩鮑魚，　片，等同時於釜内煮之，卽成。味極鮮美。若以鷄雜會之亦佳。</p>
<p>（五）煎豆腐以豆腐榨去水分，於釜内加油煎之，用之代肉，作種種素菜，無不俱佳。　　曩在滬見有所謂臭豆腐者，奇臭難聞，而嗜之者其衆。查其作法，殊不合於衛生。而當局不加禁止，竟許其沿街呌賣，則非予所知也。（却酬）</p>
<h3>棲雲山之松花</h3>
<p>— 賀連陸</p>
<p>甘肅省東百里之棲縣，西南十五里一山，名曰棲雲。南宇林立，松柏森茂，鹿豹皆有，產麝亦佳。在隴上堪稱名山之一。每届初秋，自出一種植物，約三寸餘，色黄，形如珊瑚，土人稱曰松花。採售於榆邑，　爲一種無上之鮮菜，味美異常。愚嘗詢之一般游歷家，均云中外罕見。但離土後，宜卽入庖廚，如擱置二三日，其味乏，而易生蟲。惜產於西北偏僻之地，知之者鮮，若能致之海上，則吾人可嘗試西北珍味矣。</p>
<h3>艇仔粥荔枝灣</h3>
<p>— 張亦</p>
<p>廣東風味</p>
<p>近來上海的廣東食物館子流行着一種所謂「</p>
<p>艇仔粥」者，在上海人看來，或者會覺得這個名目太新奇而莫名其妙；就是久居上海而未返故里的廣東人也會不甚了了。我在此不能不先做一點小小釋名的工作；「艇仔」者，小舟也，卽相等於上海人之所謂舢舨，杭州人之所謂划子。「粥」，就是粥，無需解釋。可是爲什麽粥也而要冠以艇仔之名呢？原來這一種粥與「魚生粥」「及第粥」是同類，不過材料的加減有不同，而創製者則爲廣州的一部份艇户，在艇上烹煮，在艇上售買的，而其爲味也，的確比之尋常的魚生粥來的得可口，所以得名。考魚生粥之製，其配合的材料是魚片，肉餅，猪肝，猪粉腸（卽小腸）鷄蛋，正菜（這是一種乾鹹菜，在廣東店有得賣的）油條，芫茜（，</p>
<p>上海人稱作香菜）葱，醬油，熟花生油，胡椒粉；而　仔粥呢，却删去了毫没意思的猪肝，粉腸不用，而替以鬆脆的花生肉，海蜇絲，蝦子三樣。先用「人仔貨」（這是一種很大的近乎圓柱形的瓦罐）把鷄和粥一齊煲，據説每煲用鷄兩三隻；到吃的時候，再將其餘的材料配齊在碗裏，然後將粥澆上去；芫茜，葱，胡椒，蝦子，花生等東西則放在粥之後。艇仔粥的形狀，水份比較魚生粥更少，可咀嚼的部份竟佔了十分之六七。花生，海蜇，蝦子，就完全是它的特徵。售賣艇仔粥者以荔枝灣一帶爲最有名。</p>
<p>荔枝灣這個地名很會令人神往，實則其地遠不及西湖；上海的　娃栗妲彷彿似之。不過在荔枝灣則大樹很多，水更污濁，兩岸破舊敗壞的建築物不少，水上的船隻頗爲擴擠，而每日更有一個時候有許多冀船絡繹不絶而已。</p>
<p>廣州的有聞階級好行樂，而廣州市内又没有什麽水上可供游樂的地方，於是荔枝灣便被寵幸而得名，近年在附近的岸上更有所小高而夫球塲之設，而艇仔粥便大行其道。</p>
<p>除了很短期的南國所謂「隆冬」之外，每個晴明的星期六和星期日或休假日的下午，有聞階級們便約情侶，呌艇仔，浮游於這不足二里的荔枝灣裏，。</p>
<p>艇仔租價，連划艇者的工力，每小時不過小洋一二毛，艇仔粥則每碗一毛；像我這樣食量的，不空肚的時候可吃兩碗，空肚的時候則非吃三碗不或。</p>

<h3>處世的藝術</h3>
<p>— 魯丁</p>
<p>勿論你是在埃甸的樂園，勿論你是在幸福的王國，縱然，你是一位天之驕子者　，一一的夢境也都免不了現實環境的支配，</p>
<p>這是説，一個人到了相當的年齡與時間，總有與社會接觸的一天，終有與環境奮鬥的一天，倘若你是没有處世的藝術，結果，便是失敗的一員，處世的藝術，許多人把它當着一件困難的事去看，但處世的藝術，决不是因難的事，即使是因難，也不應該畏視了它，</p>
<p>反这！處世的藝術，許多人把它當着一件容易的事去看，但處世的藝術，不是容易的事，即使是容易，也不應該忽略了它，</p>
<p>本來一種藝術，至少，是有它的存在的價値的，當然，處世的藝術，尤爲重要，尤其密切，</p>
<p>試請敎一般陞官者，一般發財者，他們究竟是何而得來的？僅僅專靠他們自己的本領，吾不信。專靠他們自己的福氣，吾亦不信，恐怕處世的藝術，還有最大的力量，若然，有姐兒妹兒者，又在例外，</p>
<p>處世的藝術，我簡單地説句話，第一要識時務，凡事要看風把拖，不要瞎撞，第二要面皮厚，不怕難爲情，不怕人笑話，第三要能吹牛能拍馬，再不然有欺騙的手叚或恐嚇的本領亦可，</p>
<p>這些，應該受過處世藝術專門學校長期訓練的，應有的敎訓，更非出之以圓滑的手叚，與有陰險的心機，亦不足以促其實現，</p>
<p>努力吧，用心吧，大家來研究這處世的藝術，</p>

<p>科學</p>
<h3>鐳錠及其應用</h3>
<p>— 孟復</p>
<p>鐳錠（RadiumRa），簡稱曰鐳，是化學上的原質的一種，法國化學家克利夫婦（M　MmeCurie）所發明，這原質有多種奇特的作用，並且對於近代化學和醫學的進步上，極有關係，</p>
<p>鐳原質的分佈很廣，在多種礦石，海水和幾種泉水中，都含有之，不過量是很少很少的，鐳自己並無粗礦，牠是從鈾（Uranirm）的粗礦中取出的，現在所有的鐳，大部份均從一種鈾礦，　稱爲靑礦石（Pitcbbleude）中提煉而出的在非洲的比利時屬剛果地方，有靑礦石礦數處，不過鐳的提煉，在礦物提煉化學中要算是最因難而又最費錢的了，據説照尋常的手續提煉，要取得一盎司的鐳錠，非處理到三百五十噸直至四百噸的粗礦不成，而且提煉的方法各工廠都是守絶對秘密的，</p>
<p>鐳係一種白色的金類，溶解度約7000c，在空氣中極易變化，牠的化學作用，和牠的同族兄弟（Barium）相似，不過牠另有一種奇特的作用，即所謂放射作用（Radioactivity），此種作用，實係無數鈾原子内部自己活動而發生之作用，現在寫出幾種値得注意的奇怪之現象：（一）鐳能自行放光，此光并非因有何種化合作用而發生的，所以雖把牠放在真空中，亦能照樣放光，（二）鐳能自行發熱，亦非因何種化合作用而發生的，（三）</p>
<p>鐳能使空氣變爲傳電體，（四）鐳能發出數種放射缐（）Radialrays（，此種放射缐，</p>
<p>能逐過不透光的物質，如黑紙，木板，金屬片之類，而使照相片發生變化，和X光缐相似，因其透過金屬片之能力的不同，可將此放射缐分爲甲乙丙三種：甲種最不易透過，而有發生熱力及使空氣變爲傳電體之作用，磁石能吸引而使之變折，并顯明有陽電性，乙種之透過力較大，磁石亦能使彎折，因彎折之方向和甲種相反，故可知有陰電性，丙種之透過力最强，即鐵片厚至十二寸，亦能透過，此缐有使照相片發生變化及使空氣成傳電體之能力，然不受磁石的吸引，故此缐實爲一種波浪作用，而非實在之物質所成，（五）鐳能逐漸變化而成爲多種之其他物質，例如用空氣少許，使在鐳原質上經過，則此空氣中，即含有一種亦有放射性的氣體，此種氣體初稱爲鐳錠流出物（RadiumEmanation），</p>
<p>現在科學家稱之曰尼東（Neton），</p>
<p>説到鐳的應用，便是在於療治從前</p>
<p>所謂絶症的癌症（Cancer）俗謂之疽，因爲癌症祇有用鐳錠來療治，其餘簡直無藥石可望痊愈，醫治的方法，便是用鐳的丙種放射缐，向癌症處照射，那麽癌症的細胞，便會透漸縐癟，如果癌症的細胞，完全縐癟而死，那便奏効了，不過，丙種放射缐，同時也能損壞人體中康健的組織，因此對於鐳的應用，必須有手術上的技巧，現在有種新的方法，便是用放射性瓦斯（Radioactivegas），a2</p>
<p>即前之所謂尼東，鐳除了醫用之外，其餘的用途都不重要，譬如作爲自己發光的塗染物，如夜光表上的長短針所用的，不過非但價太貴，而且已有了代替品，隔了厚的金屬攝影，也有價値賤的X光缐代替，</p>
<p>最後，大家要知這種鐳是世　上最貴重的東西了，最初每盎司要値三十萬金元，現在因產出較多，然而每盎司也價値十五萬金元，當然，所以會如此昂貴，無非是因爲產量的稀少和提煉的困難，同時醫藥界的需要，也是促成的一個原因，鐳雖昂貴，也有長處，即放射光缐消失極微，雖用了二千年，也不過消失了光的强度的一半</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3>家庭制度的改良</h3>
<p>— 宗文</p>
<p>新　家庭的一個比較</p>
<p>家庭的組織，不外乎同居　　　分居制二種，同居制即所謂舊家庭，分居制即所謂新家庭，本來在中國差不多一般人都採用的是同居制，好像從古到今已民了習慣似的，於是什麽「張公百忍」哩，「五世同堂」哩，至今傳爲美談，但究竟舊家庭好呢？還是新家庭的好？這是一個很値得研究，討論，的問題，也就是社會上一個很重要急於解决的一個問題，</p>
<p>舊家庭重要的原則，即所謂「同居」，談到這裏恐怕有人要問我，「舊家庭中他們的交子，兄弟，夫婦，妯娌，··都可以聚在一處，不是很快樂的嗎」，的確，原來它的壞處即聚在一處呢，爲什麽，</p>
<p>（一）人數太嘈雜，易生賴心，中國</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>人之所以有依賴心，原來都是從家庭中所養成的，人民旣如此，國家也豈得不如此，</p>
<p>（二）其間分子，易生惡感，從此弄得家庭中的姑媳，妯娌間，便你猜我忌的　永無太平的日子了，即使家長是很好的，其餘的人也是很好的，　不會生出什麽事來了罷，但是這是不過一些面和心不和的假面具，其實一家的人性情，能夠一樣的嗎，俗話説得好，「一娘生九子，連娘十餘心」，真是説得好啊，我武斷的説一句，「我國的軍人性，恐怕也是舊家庭所養成的罷」，</p>
<p>（三）個性不能自由發展，不能養成獨立的精神，</p>
<p>（四）家庭中的家長對於分子間的處置極難，</p>
<p>（五）比較心和妬忌心，乃人所同有，同居之家庭，每因比較心和妬忌心而生懶惰心，有弊必有利，其利是什麽，這是要談到經濟上面去了，同居之家庭，財產集合，能使生產率增大，若以消費而論，同居之消費率小，對外經濟，如國家的課税，社會的捐欵，大都以家爲單位，故較分居爲經濟，這一點講來舊家庭不是也有利嗎，</p>
<p>新家庭重要的原則，即所謂「分居」其利有下列數種，</p>
<p>（一）實行分居制，依賴心可無由發生，</p>
<p>（二）分居之後不單兄弟妯娌間的情誼加厚，即對於交母翁姑也一些兒不會减少，因爲分居之後，可各做各的事，能各負各的責任，一切束縛的痛苦，屈從的弊病都可以從此消滅了，互相親愛，互相帮助，便可以從此發生了，</p>
<p>（三）個性能自由發展，可以養成獨立的精神，</p>
<p>（四）分居之後，家庭的管理較易，　　（五）分居之後，雖同一有比較心和妬忌心，然其結果，足以使各人努力奮鬥，</p>
<p>總而言之，同居的利僅限於物質方面，而分居的利則兼及精神方面，精神方面若已健全，物質方面即使消費稍亦可補救，况因計畫之周密，而反能節省，那麽何樂而不爲呢，</p>
<p>通觀以上數點比較，那麽舊家庭好呢，還是新家庭好，一個問題，也可以很簡便的解决了罷，</p>
<p>茶餘酒後</p>
<h3>筵席上聞見趣劇</h3>
<p>— 迓施</p>
<p>以香烟頭　　作爲禮物</p>
<p>上月終，吾友×君，言及他友×君，方出學門數日，就得着×省×縣縣長的美缺，這是多麽榮耀的事啊，他即日就要上任，我還須往恭賀呢，但是我一人覺得途中寂寞，我想你同往一行，不知尊意若何，那時我聽了這話，實在羨慕，應允同行，</p>
<p>至是日我即整理衣冠，同友×君向前而去，行至弄外，自有迎賓官來前迎接，同行入弄，方進門見室内四面俱是縣紅結彩閙熱非凡，恭賀賓朋，皆是鴻儒才士，大家惕談良久。讓坐入席，菜食皆是山珍海錯，那種美味，自不必談了，</p>

<h3>The Enhancement of Sino-German Friendship - A Brief Note</h3>
<p>—Welcome Mrs. Moore!— Mrs. Moore, an American residing in Germany, represents various German circles this time. She brings with her sample gifts to Shanghai to express sympathy to the 19th Route Army of our country, which previously resisted the strong and violent. In her remarks, in addition to praising the loyalty and bravery of our country's soldiers and conveying the deep sympathy of the German people, she also stated, "The people of European and American countries, a portion of them, indeed have sympathy for China, but the majority, due to being separated by circumstances, have failed to accurately understand China, being misled by malicious propaganda spread by a certain party when in Geneva." China should also have means to remedy this." This is truly a good admonition from a friendly person, and it is something that the people of our country should adhere to.</p>
<p>The lack of understanding among European and American people regarding the situation in the Far East is a major obstacle to resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute. Precisely because of this lack of understanding, they still regard Japan's war of aggression as a means of self-defense. Precisely because of this lack of understanding, they still regard Japan's seized interests as special rights and interests. And precisely because of this lack of understanding, the Japanese are able to exploit their weaknesses and engage in all kinds of malicious and untrue propaganda, making it impossible to analyze right and wrong. Since the people of various countries have been deceived by this, how can we expect them to provide us with substantial assistance?</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Northeast Incident, Japan's propaganda on the international stage can be said to be meticulous in every detail. The comings and goings of diplomatic personnel and the frequent sending and receiving of correspondence and telegrams are, of course, unnecessary to mention. Recently, the dispatch of Yosuke Matsuoka to Geneva was almost entirely for the purpose of slandering our country's national policies and concealing our own country's atrocities. Although politicians from various countries who are familiar with the situation in the Far East may not be easily fooled by it, the general European and American people with insufficient understanding will inevitably be subtly and imperceptibly drawn into its trap.</p>
<p>Propaganda can shift international attention and gain the sympathy of friendly countries. The importance of this is self-evident. However, observing our country from top to bottom, it seems that we do not pay much attention to this. I still remember that when the September 18th Incident occurred last year, our country's missions to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan had not yet been appointed or had not yet taken office, let alone others. More than a year has passed since the incident, and we have not heard of any practical methods of external propaganda to make the European and American powers deeply aware of Japan's atrocities and to make the people of various countries understand the situation in China. How can we blame people from friendly countries for being unaware of the situation in China, and how can we blame the Japanese side for taking the opportunity to engage in all kinds of malicious propaganda to confuse the world's perception?</p>
<p>Although the dispatch of the International League of Nations Investigating Team to the East was also for the purpose of clearly understanding the situation in the Far East, because it is an international organization, it is inevitably subject to constraints from various parties, and the investigation period is only six months, so how much can be gained? It is, of course, inevitable that its report does not meet expectations and cannot solve the Northeast issue. Now, if we do not seek the fair public opinion of the world, then we must first find a way to make the people of the whole world have a clear understanding of China and a deep sympathy for China. Only when the people of various countries have a clear understanding can we expect to have fair public opinion in the world.</p>
<p>To make the people of various countries have a clear understanding, first, we must have extensive external propaganda. Mrs. Moore stated that "China currently has a very large radio station and should report and transmit all the latest news to Geneva as soon as possible." This is one aspect. Secondly, we should send more diplomatic personnel to various countries to engage in large-scale propaganda activities. It is reported that Shih Chao-chi, Kung Hsiang-hsi, and Li Chin-lun are currently actively working with the staff of the embassy in Washington, D.C. This is also an important task. We hope that this kind of work can be extended to various countries, and the effect will be even greater. Propaganda work has a great effect. Of course, we should know that what should be propagated is definitely not empty words fabricated out of thin air, but materials generated from practical realities. The resistance against Japan by the 19th Route Army last time and the recent activities of the Northeast Volunteer Army are all facts of our country's resistance to foreign aggression and upholding justice, which are most likely to attract the sympathy of people from various countries. Therefore, if our propaganda focuses on this kind of fact, it will easily make various countries understand the truth about the Japanese policy of aggression and will definitely increase the degree of understanding of the situation in the Far East among people from various countries.</p>
<p>However, the achievements of the 19th Route Army and the arduous struggles of the Northeast Volunteer Army are all manifestations of the national spirit of our country. From this, we further know that to gain the sympathy of people from various countries, we still must make our own efforts and fight resolutely. If we compromise on everything and never use force to resist and merely seek survival, we will only become a laughingstock to foreigners, and how can we expect others to sympathize with us?</p>
<p>Germany and our country are both countries oppressed by foreign neighbors. The sympathy of its people for us is naturally deeper than that of other countries. We express our deep gratitude for Mrs. Moore's enthusiasm in representing the German people in expressing sympathy for our 19th Route Army. And we wish for the enhancement of the friendship between the people of China and Germany.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Gaicun of the Shandong Provincial Party Rectification Committee came to Nanjing to discuss solutions for the conflict between the Korean and Liu armies.

It is said that Korea had intended to designate Laizhou and five other counties as the Liu army's defense zone. However, Liu still hoped to include Yantai and Longkou in the defense zone. The military and political authorities must consider the government's prestige on this issue and are reluctant to accept the methods requested by either side. It is awaiting Chiang's decision, with instructions to comply with the reply. (Dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian telegraphed his representative in Nanjing on the 6th, stating that this morning Korea sent two brigades led by Rong Guangxing, Chen Dexin, and Zhao Xinde from Hetoudian and Songwangzhuang to launch a fierce attack on Laiyang. After the Liang brigade fought valiantly, they used landmines to bombard the attacking force, which retreated due to excessive casualties. (Dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Military Affairs Commission previously telegraphed Han Fuju, hoping that his troops would withdraw west of Weixian and await a central government resolution. It is reported that Korea has not yet replied. It is also reported that the central government has decided on appropriate steps to resolve the Korean-Liu issue. In addition to Chiang Kai-shek directly telegraphing Korea and Liu to instruct them on the central government's intentions, He Yingqin has also received a telegram from Chiang asking him to instruct the representatives of Korea and Liu in Nanjing to quickly telegraph both sides to immediately cease military action and await appropriate handling. (Dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Li Yue and Fan Lai suo took the evening train to Weixian, then transferred to Shahe and Laizhou to inspect. It is uncertain whether they entered Laizhou city yesterday. This will be decided after arriving in Shahe. Korea sent Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Shou, Counselor, to accompany them. (Dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Jiang Bocheng stated that he had telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin, Zhang, regarding Korea's expressed intentions and that he would fully listen to the central government's handling of the Jiaozhou issue. (Dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Yantai) According to reliable sources, a portion of the Liu army in Laiyang broke through the Korean army's lines and advanced westward towards Laizhou, apparently to meet with Liu Zhennian. Laiyang is about 50 miles south of Yantai, and Laizhou is about 50 miles west of Laiyang. The central government seems to be taking a neutral stance on the Korean-Liu war, but it is widely believed that they have been supplying ammunition to the Liu army.

<p>Chiang Kai-shek Denies Japanese Newspaper's Rumors</p>
<h3>Telegram from Hu Puhan, President of Fumin News</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Tokyo dispatch from the Japanese News Agency on the 6th states: "This morning, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, regarding the Blue Shirts Society organized by Chiang Kai-shek, issued a declaration abandoning Manchuria, and commented on it in an editorial, saying that the Blue Shirts Society, organized by Chiang Kai-shek, is using this pretense of foreign diplomacy and patriotism to further confuse the Chinese masses, who are caught up in the so-called revolutionary diplomacy. Suddenly, the official statement of abandoning Manchuria starts a movement to unify national opinion. Although a bit late, it can be said to be a very good approach. Chiang Kai-shek is truly worthy of being a revolutionary hero, but internal political strife in China may worsen as a result, and it is unknown whether this kind of movement can promote domestic unity." This is complete fabrication and has no basis. Hu Puhan, president of the Shanghai Minbao News Agency, believes that the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun is a major newspaper in Japan, and its public remarks slandering the revolutionary leader are likely to confuse international observers. He has specially telegraphed Chairman Chiang to request clarification. Chairman Chiang replied in a telegram on the 8th, "Shanghai Minbao's President Hu Puhan, your telegram received. I have telegraphed the Central News Agency in Nanjing to investigate the original text and completely deny it. I hope you will also consult with the Central News Agency nearby to deliberate on the wording and strongly condemn the fallacy. Chiang Chung-cheng, the 8th."

<h3>Plans to Go to Datong Later</h3>

(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang told reporters at Nankou Station that he would stay in Chahar for two or three days and then go to Datong for a long stay. He said that the investigation report by the delegation came up with a brilliant idea: international co-management. He likened it to the case of Lord Lytton, who lost his cane and blamed the good people of Taian County and even arrested the sedan carriers. As a result, it was found in the grass. It is extremely painful. Apart from using force, there is no other way to recover lost territory. He greatly admired the heroic sacrifice of the righteous army. The wind outside the stronghold was fierce, and hundreds of thousands of comrades were still fighting desperately in single clothing. The people of the country should find ways to help. (Beiping) Yu Xinqing, Feng Yuxiang's secretary, said that Feng's purpose in going north was to make efforts for the anti-Japanese forces in the north through various relationships.

<h3>Zheng Jicheng Case: Prosecution Filed by the Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>(Jinan) In the case of Zheng Jicheng's assassination of Zhang Zongchang, the Jinan District Court Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation court several times. Prosecutors Zhu Fengxiang and Zhu Weiran have now filed a public prosecution. The reasons are roughly as follows: "Referencing each other's statements, it is sufficient to show that Chen Fengshan was indeed present and carried out the shooting of Zhang Zongchang, Liu Huaizhou, and Liu Qingxun. In addition, the defendants have harbored resentment for a long time because Zheng Jinsheng was killed by Zhang Zongchang. This time, carrying pistols and traveling by car to the station to commit the crime was premeditated. According to Article 42 of the Criminal Law, the defendants, with a single overall intention, committed the crime of killing three people at the same time and place in one act, each constituting a crime under Article 284, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 and Paragraph 2 of the same law. It is appropriate to apply the provisions of the first part of Article 74 of the same law and impose the heavier punishment. Furthermore, Zheng Jicheng surrendered himself to the officers and soldiers of the enforcement team before the crime was discovered, which has been verified by this office through investigation with the Military Law Office of the Third Route Command. He is entitled to a reduction of one-third of the punishment for the first crime. Furthermore, the circumstances of the defendants' crimes are not without mitigating factors and may be appropriately reduced in accordance with Article 77 of the same law." The public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. (Special dispatch on the 8th)</p>

<p>Foreign Important News</p>
<h3>US-Japan War Deemed Unavoidable</h3>
<p>—Observations from the Soviet Union's Government Newspaper—</p>
<p>Japan Actively Expanding Armaments</p>
<p>Deeply Afraid of a US-Russia Alliance Against Japan</p>
<p>The Kokumin News Agency's Moscow dispatch on the 7th reported that the Russian newspaper Izvestia, the central organ of the Soviet Red Army, published an article today evaluating the world situation and the Manchurian question, predicting that a US-Japan war is difficult to avoid in the near future. The newspaper stated that Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" has further strained relations between the two countries, forcing the United States to actively contact other countries to isolate Japan. However, besides the behind-the-scenes diplomatic activities aimed at competing for Pacific hegemony, there is other more tangible evidence to gauge the increasingly perilous state of relations between the two countries, such as the gathering of the US Navy in the Pacific, the addition of fortifications on the Hawaiian Islands, especially at Pearl Harbor. On the Japanese side, there are also countermeasures, all of which prove the active state of military preparation in both countries. Pravda also commented on the same issue, insisting that a pact exists between Japan and France and is being actively undermined by American imperialism. It also stated that Britain tacitly supports Japan's use of force against China and the United States, as Britain quite favors the partition of China.</p>
<p>Havas Agency's Tokyo dispatch: Although alarming rumors have recently spread everywhere, Russo-Japanese relations have seemed to improve greatly in recent weeks. According to well-informed sources, war between Japan and the Soviet Union seems imminent, possibly breaking out before the end of September. It is said that this war will be initiated by the Russian side, as the harsh winter in Manchuria will cause difficulties for the Japanese army, and Russia wants to take advantage of this opportunity to start a war against Japan. The activities of Japanese naval and army arsenals, the large-scale ordering of military materials, the banning of newspaper reports on certain events, and the so-called "Manchukuo government's" ultimatum to the Soviet Union are all sources of these rumors. It is indeed true that Japan's military preparations are rapidly advancing, but these military preparations are not enough to meet the needs of an immediate start to the war. It is even more unbelievable to say that these preparations are aimed at Soviet Russia. The commencement of construction and ordering of ordnance can be explained by the following needs: (1) Replenishing the ammunition reserves consumed in the battles in eastern provinces and Shanghai; (2) Increasing military equipment (such as airplanes, bombs, infantry cannons, transport vehicles, and automobiles) to fight more fiercely against the volunteer army in eastern provinces and Jehol; (3) Preparing in advance to prevent unexpected incidents in the event of disputes with China, Russia, and the United States; (4) Satisfying the demands of Japanese nationalists and militarists. Japan's policy toward Manchuria is already well-thought-out, and at the same time, it is constantly seeking ways to respond to the actions of the great powers. In addition, we often hear that the incorporation of Jehol into Manchuria is indispensable for protecting Manchuria and avoiding Chinese encroachment, because the mountains and ridges of Jehol are a natural barrier between Manchuria and the rest of China. Therefore, the mere occupation of Jehol cannot but cause new wars and new disputes and is sufficient to become a reason for military preparation. At present, although the Japanese people maintain a calm attitude, there are many who panic because of the reactions of the United States, the League of Nations, and Russia after the recognition of "Manchukuo." Regardless of which country Japan will go to war with, it is preparing for war, as described above. However, once the worry of being invaded disappears and is replaced by the worry of economic difficulties, this war preparation frenzy may also disappear once and for all. In general, the army tends to regard the Soviet Union as a dangerous target, because after the completion of the famous Five-Year Plan, the national strength of the Soviet Union will greatly increase. Therefore, the general opinion is that if a Russo-Japanese war is unavoidable, it should be waged before the Soviet Union's industrial facilities are completed, and the assistance of the United States should be sought on the grounds of anti-communism. The navy's opinion is the opposite, regarding the United States as a hypothetical enemy and preferring to reach a temporary understanding with the Soviet Union. According to the navy's speculation, a Japanese-US war will inevitably occur, and the earlier it occurs, the more beneficial it will be to Japan, because the advantage of the Japanese navy is being diminished day by day. As a result of the London Naval Treaty, the Japanese navy will completely lose its advantage by 1936. Furthermore, the army and navy believe that it is beneficial for Japan to wage war against Soviet Russia or the United States alone. However, if the United States and Russia join forces against Japan, they cannot help but worry.</p>
<h3>Japan Sends Students to the US for Propaganda</h3>
<p>To Ease US-Japan Relations</p>
<p>The Dentsu News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 8th that the Toyo Culture Association will send students to the United States in the middle of next month to hold lectures in sixty major cities in an attempt to dispel American misunderstandings about the Far East issue. The association is currently recruiting students, and today it selected Ito Satoru of Doshisha University, Hatayama Takeo of Chuo University, and Yamada Tadashi of Meiji University to be sent to the United States. Mr. Hatsu, a student from Arigane University who submitted a thesis on Japanese-American relations, will also travel to the United States with them.</p>
<p>The Dentsu News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 8th that international students who graduated from universities such as Columbia, Harvard, Chicago, and Yale sent telegrams to their respective universities, pointing out that the reports lack adequate understanding and hoping that the United States will adopt a fair and impartial attitude.</p>
<h3>On the Lytton Report</h3>
<p>The US Has Not Yet Expressed its Views</p>
<p>The Investigation Team Issued Twelve Maps for Reference</p>
<p>The British Observer Advocates Economic Pressure on Japan</p>
<p>The Havas Agency reported from London on the 7th that, according to sources in Washington, the US State Department has not yet officially endorsed the Lytton Report. The State Department also has not indicated whether the United States will have a representative participating when the Council of the League of Nations reviews the Lytton Report. It is believed that Stimson is temporarily keeping silent on these issues due to the impending presidential election.</p>
<p>The Kokumin News Agency reported from Geneva on the 7th that the League of Nations Investigation Team issued twelve maps on Saturday regarding the Lytton Report to provide supporting evidence for the facts contained in the report. Among them were a map of the scope of Japanese interests, the locations of Japanese troops stationed at various times, and a map specifically depicting the location of the Manchurian Railway destruction claimed by the Japanese on September 18th, titled "The Nation of the Alleged Explosion Point." The destroyed location is marked with a cross.</p>
<p>Reuters reported from London on the 8th that the British weekly magazine commented on the overall situation in the Far East based on the Lytton Report. Its views can be summarized by the Observer's statement: "The current status of Manchukuo was created and maintained by Japanese force. The only question for the world is whether the final victory will be for the rule of force or the rule of law." However, the general opinion seems to be that Japan, for its own interests, should understand that peace in Asia depends on Japan being willing to negotiate with China based on the Lytton Report. The Observer also stated that if either Japan or China is unwilling to accept the request to negotiate a solution to the dispute based on the methods proposed by the Subsequent Investigation Team, the League of Nations will consider it the greatest current danger and deal with it. The Investigation Team has opened a path for Japan to accept without damaging its reputation. Any attempt at coercion would be futile and harmful. The Observer views the Lytton Report's exposure of Japan's behavior as very gentle but incisive and can test the extent of the world's conscience. If Japan rejects this report, the League of Nations should declare Japan as a country that violates the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and apply economic pressure to force it to reconsider its policies. The New Statesman and the Nation also echoed the above views. The Observer further stated that if the international community adopts such actions, it will definitely gain the support of the United States. Japan's internal situation cannot withstand strong external pressure. If applied, it is expected to lead to its collapse in a very short period of time.</p>
<h3>Japan's Three Ministries Joint Conference Decides on League of Nations Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Implement Established Plans</p>
<p>Do Not Adopt Appeasement Measures</p>
<p>The Dentsu News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 8th that the joint meeting of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Ministries of the Japanese government to draft an opinion on the Lytton Report was held at the official residence of the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM. After exchanging views, they unanimously agreed to proceed with the discussion in a swift manner and decided on the following three major policies, with a second meeting scheduled for the 12th. The three major policies are: (1) The Japanese government is determined to struggle to the end to fulfill its original intention declared internally and externally; (2) Regarding the implementation of the Empire's policies, it is necessary to maintain the demeanor of a great power and adopt honorable actions, without resorting to appeasement, and with the determination to withdraw from the League of Nations if necessary, but this should not be done hastily. Regardless of what country in the world, if one puts oneself in Japan's position and carefully considers it based on the ideal of world peace and Far Eastern peace, one will know that there is no other means to adopt other than the one Japan has adopted. This point must be strongly explained in the opinion to seek the understanding of the people of all countries.</p>
<h3>Initiate the Organization of National Defense Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>Implement Strict Military Training</p>
<p>Prepare for Future Foreign Wars</p>
<p>The China United News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 8th that the National Defense Volunteer Corps, advocated by Lieutenant General Araki, Lieutenant General Ogasawara, Minister of Education Hatoyama, Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai, Mayor Nagata, and Secretary-General Shibata, held an inaugural meeting at Minister of Education Hatoyama's official residence in Nagatacho at 10:30 AM this morning. It was decided to select and organize a National Defense Volunteer Corps from the Youth Army Corps and students, implement strict military training, and establish branches in Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Kansai, Sanyo, Sanin, Kyushu, Shikoku, Korea, and Taiwan, each branch headed by a commander-in-chief. The headquarters will be located in Tokyo, serving as a reserve force for the next rural army, preparing for use in foreign wars.</p>
<h3>Nomura Transferred to Yokosuka Commander</h3>
<p>The Far East News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 8th that Admiral Yamamoto, the current commander of the Yokosuka Naval Base, will be transferred to Naval Department Advisor, the position of commander of the naval base will be succeeded by Nomura Kichisaburo, the former commander of the Third Squadron responsible for the Shanghai War. The appointment ceremony will be held in the Imperial Palace tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Traitor Bao Guancheng Visits the Russian Ambassador to Japan</h3>
<p>The China United News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 8th that the representative of the puppet organization stationed in Japan, traitor Bao Guancheng, visited the Russian Ambassador to Japan, Troyanovsky, today, earnestly requesting Russia to recognize the puppet organization and proposing that Russia and Manchukuo sign a non-aggression treaty. However, the Russian ambassador, knowing that this was a trick played by the Japanese and the traitor, was unusually cautious and did not give a clear answer to Bao's request, merely offering perfunctory replies for several hours. Bao Guancheng ultimately left in frustration without any results.</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Tokyo on the 8th that Bao Guancheng gave a speech yesterday at the invitation of the sound film machine manufacturer, saying, "The establishment of the new state of Manchukuo relies on the help of many Japanese people, whose chivalrous acts are like General Lafayette's assistance to the American independence. "Manchukuo is now firmly in favor of creating peace in Liaodong. If a third party puts pressure on the new state, the thirty million people will rise up and reject it as if it were one person."</p>
<h3>Traitor Ding Shiyuan Wants to Win Over Small Countries</h3>
<p>The China United News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 8th that according to the puppet representative Ding Shiyuan, regarding the puppet organization's policy toward the League of Nations, the major powers have been unable to endorse the independence of the puppet regime, and the smaller countries may not adopt the same attitude. Therefore, the puppet organization will actively win over small countries such as Czechoslovakia, Estonia, and Latvia, which have close ties with Japan, and earnestly request them to recognize the puppet state first as the puppet regime's next tier of support.</p>
<h3>Northeast Economic Annexation Plan Nears Completion</h3>

Therefore, he is going to Tokyo from here this morning. The concrete plan that Director Sotogawa is taking to Tokyo mainly includes the following: (1) Not to oppress the industry of mainland Japan; (2) Specialize in the production of raw materials; (3) Focus on special industries.</p>
<p>The China United News Agency reported from Tokyo on the 8th that the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Northeast China opened its 16th joint conference in Andong today, with representatives from various regions participating. Among the twenty proposals, seven were related to the Japanese-Manchu special customs case, all of which requested that Japan should have special treatment compared to other countries. Other proposals regarding economic annexation were also numerous.</p>
<h3>Japanese Armed Immigrant Group Arrives in Dalian</h3>

The group is led by Lieutenant Ichikawa, a current Japanese military officer. Today, they left Dalian by train at 9:50 AM for Shenyang, and then transferred to the Songhua River area, their destination. This trip has received full subsidies and detailed planning from the Japanese government. Under the guidance of the military, this first armed immigration is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Germany Accepts Invitation to Attend London Conference</h3>
<p>Declares that it Should Encourage Each Other with the Spirit of the Lausanne Conference</p>
<p>The Anglo-French Memorandum Should Not Be the Basis for Discussion</p>
<p>US Representative Davis First Goes to England to Discuss Disarmament</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Berlin on the 7th that Germany's reply has accepted Great Britain's invitation to participate in the Four-Power Conference. This statement has been verified by well-informed sources. However, it is heard that Germany has stated that it must conduct a completely objective study of Germany's claim for equal armaments before the conference can achieve effective results. Diplomatic circles are now hinting that the German government will reserve the right to state its views on this matter in detail when the conference is convened.</p>
<p>The Havas Agency reported from Berlin on the 8th that the German response to the British government's invitation to attend the Five-Power Conference contains the following key points, according to reliable sources. The response begins with the German government declaring that Germany is prepared to participate in open negotiations and is willing to cooperate sincerely with the major powers of Britain, France, Italy, and the United States to seek an appropriate solution to the disarmament issue. Germany also declares that the negotiations proposed by the British government should be in accordance with the text and spirit of the final declaration of the Lausanne Conference. This declaration explains that, in addition to the financial issues already resolved in Lausanne, other issues should be resolved in accordance with the desire to establish a new situation and restore trust among nations. The German government requests that the London Conference should take this approach as its starting point and should not use the memorandum issued by the British and French governments rejecting Germany's equal armaments as the basis for effective discussion. The German government then expressed its hope that the Five-Power Conference to be convened by the British government can produce a result that allows Germany to rejoin the Disarmament Conference, as Germany has always hoped that the Disarmament Conference can achieve practical results. Finally, the German government suggests that the date of the London Conference should be slightly later than originally scheduled. The German response states that the date of October 11th will interfere with the work of the London Conference because the General Assembly of the International Federation will not have closed. The German note was typed and approximately two pages long. The issue of whether other countries besides the ones already invited by the United Kingdom should participate in the London Conference was mentioned briefly in the note, but no concrete measures were proposed. The German government will only publish the key points of the response; the full text of the note will not be published.</p>
<p>Reuters reported from London on the 7th that the German government formally replied today to the British government's invitation to the London Four-Power Conference. The content has not been published, but it is heard that the German response expressed a sincere willingness regarding the scope of discussion, but also a willingness to participate in any discussion that can achieve a satisfactory solution. At the same time, Davis, the United States representative to the preparatory committee for the World Economic Conference in Geneva, had a confidential meeting with French Prime Minister Herriot in Paris for several hours today. During the talks, Herriot earnestly stated to Davis France's preparations for discussing all aspects of disarmament, including Germany's demand for equality, but argued that discussions on this issue should be held in Geneva, not in London. Davis then departed for London, reportedly to meet with representatives of the British government to discuss various matters and arrange preliminary discussions between the naval powers. He had suggested this during the Geneva Disarmament Conference in July. The events related to the World Economic Conference will also be discussed in London, as his intention in coming to Europe from the United States was for the World Economic Conference, not the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>The Havas Agency reported from London on the 7th that the peace plan and organization proposed by the French delegation in Geneva are not well known to the outside world, so the government cannot make an official declaration. However, political circles often discuss it. Generally, people feel that there are many points of agreement between the French plan and the Hoover plan. The Liberal Party has expressed great sympathy for the French plan. This group hopes that Britain can support the French proposal, believing that the security issue can be resolved by abolishing weapons that are sufficient to destroy permanent national defense, so Germany will have no excuse to demand the restoration of armaments, and the German representatives at the Geneva Conference can rejoin the conference. However, the Liberal Party does not support distinguishing between defensive and offensive weapons, as they view it as undermining overall disarmament. As for the Conservative Party, they are extremely silent and take the opportunity to say that submarines are offensive weapons, but this is only the initial impression, and there may be changes in the future.</p>
<p>The Kokumin News Agency reported from Rome on the 7th that Britain's convening of a five-nation roundtable conference to discuss Germany's demand for equal armaments now appears to be failing. Italian newspapers unanimously expressed regret for this and openly accused France of undermining this excellent plan. The newspaper Il Lavoro stated that France's undermining of this plan is because it does not want to reduce its own armaments, and on the other hand, it does not want Germany to increase its armaments. Furthermore, the new disarmament plan proposed by France only makes the problem more chaotic and difficult for other countries to accept. According to those who know the details, this new plan is merely a revival of Thedy's international army fantasy in order to consolidate French hegemony. The newspaper also criticized France for deliberately delaying the discussion of various issues in order to stall the general reduction of armaments.</p>
<h3>Bolivia and Paraguay Begin Aerial Warfare</h3>
<p>Rumors of Revolution in Bolivia</p>
<p>The Havas Agency reported from the Bolivian capital on the 8th that the Bolivian General Staff announced that aircraft from Bolivia and Paraguay have begun fighting, marking the first aerial combat since the Chaco dispute began. Paraguayan aircraft attempted to bomb the Bolivian fort of Yaro, but were repelled by Bolivian aircraft and fled.</p>
<p>The Havas Agency reported from London on the 8th that, according to a wireless telegram intercepted from Bolivia in the Paraguayan capital, a revolution appears to have broken out in Bolivia, but this news has not yet been verified.</p>
<h3>Mexican Government Orders Confiscation of Churches</h3>
<p>The Kokumin News Agency reported from the Mexican capital on the 7th that the Mexican government today ordered the authorities in Tiernayucan to confiscate the town's newly built Catholic church, presumably because the church has not been registered with the authorities. According to a telegram from the town, the order has already been carried out, and people are temporarily prohibited from attending worship services. Tiernayucan is a town on Mexico's northern border, only sixteen miles from San Diego, USA. A considerable amount of the church's construction costs came from American donations.</p>
<p>The Kokumin News Agency reported from Veracruz (Mexico) on the 7th that the Veracruz State Legislature today declared the Pope to be an enemy country in a formal resolution. All Catholic priests who are citizens of the country should be deported immediately, and all Catholic churches should be treated as enemy property in wartime and confiscated.</p>
<h3>French Treasury Deficit</h3>
<p>Propose Reducing Expenditures to Compensate</p>
<p>The Kokumin News Agency reported from Paris on the 7th that the French treasury currently has a deficit of 5 billion francs, and even with strenuous efforts to economize, it is feared that the deficit will increase to 6 billion francs by the end of the fiscal year on December 31st. A cabinet meeting was held today to discuss methods of compensation. It is heard that the proposed plan includes a 5% general reduction in the salaries of civil servants and a revision of the amount of pensions for veterans. However, solely relying on reducing expenditures may not be able to compensate for the deficit, and it is expected that part of it will still have to be covered by issuing domestic bonds. Furthermore, the salary reduction for civil servants has not yet been decided, as it is feared that it will arouse public anger and affect the position of the cabinet.</p>
<h3>Rich Mineral Deposits Discovered in the Hinterlands of Labrador, North America</h3>
<p>Ancient Relics Unearthed in Mexico</p>
<p>Reuters reported from St. John's, Newfoundland, on the 8th that, according to news today, an American aviator named Ponshelen discovered a large mineral area in the hinterlands of Labrador last year while searching for wood. The area has nuggets of gold, silver, copper, lead, tin, iron, asbestos, and mica. Pons is now has concluded a contract with the Newfoundland government, which grants him a patent limited to restricted areas, and the government has sent personnel to investigate. After the investigation results have been obtained, the government will open the entire territory for large-scale mining.</p>
<p>The Havas Agency reported from the Swedish capital on the 7th that Swedish explorer Lint discovered the palace ruins of the Dor Dalege tribe, the earliest inhabitants of Mexico, in San Juan, Mexico. He also found more than 10,000 scattered objects, including a stone statue of the sun god. Museums in Mexico City and here consider this discovery to be valuable and are competing to purchase them for display.</p>
<p>News</p>
<h3>Feng Yu-hsiang Goes North</h3>
<p>Expressing Opinions on the Current Situation; Destination of Northward Journey Undecided</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This morning (the 7th) at 5 AM, Feng Yu-hsiang's special train departed from Tai'an heading north. At 7:15 AM, the train arrived at Mount Tai. At that time, the 2nd Regiment, 1st Battalion of the Pistol Brigade was already on guard on the Jinpu Railway Station platform. Outside the station, the Southwest Township Public Security Bureau had increased personnel, and mounted police were patrolling. Shortly thereafter, Provincial Chairman Han Fu-qu, Civil Affairs Commissioner Li Shu-chun, Jinan Mayor Wen Cheng-lieh, Finance Commissioner Chi Hsiang-jung, Provincial Secretary-General Chang Shao-tang, Construction Commissioner Chang Hung-lieh, Provincial Counselor Chai Chun-lin, Municipal Works Bureau Director Chang Hung-wen, Public Security Bureau Director Wang Kai-ming, and Xiong Guan-min all arrived at the station to welcome him. Shi Jizhi did not arrive. A reporter asked Chairman Han about the reasons for Feng's hurried departure from Shandong. Han replied that it was because foreigners were saying that Mr. Feng was behind the Jiaodong Incident. Mr. Feng decided to leave Shandong to avoid suspicion. There was no other reason. At 7:30, the special train entered the station. Soldiers and police saluted with rifles and knives. After the train stopped,</p>
<p>Han Fu-qu was the first to board the train to meet with Feng. Feng was still wearing the blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers that he had when he came to Shandong last winter, with leggings, blue socks, and black cloth shoes. He had long hair and was not wearing a hat. His complexion was ruddy and he did not look ill. Feng told reporters that his departure from Mount Tai was for no special reason. He had been in Mount Tai for a long time and wanted to move to another place. Regarding the League of Nations report, he thought that the Chinese people had all paid close attention to it. He believed that this report completely represented the great powers' so-called justice and righteousness for semi-colonies. If the Chinese people do not unite and work hard to resist foreign insults, the future will be even more unimaginable. He knew nothing about the Jiaodong war beforehand, and he was very sorry for the occurrence of this unfortunate event. However, the lack of unified administrative power in the country's provinces and the confrontation and restraint of two forces are the main reasons for the recurring disasters. If there is no fundamental solution to this point, there will be no solution. He hoped that the authorities could find a reasonable solution to the Jiaodong issue. On the issue of resisting Japan, he still advocated recovering lost territories by force. Only resistance is China's only way out, and so on. Afterwards, he asked Han Fu-qu to get off the train and apologize to the other welcomers, asking them to go back. The crowd dispersed. Han and Wen Cheng-lieh boarded the train again to talk with Feng. According to Deng Chongxi, Feng's destination on this trip north was still undecided. No one from Mount Tai was accompanying him. In addition to Deng, there were his secretary Zhang Xinqing, physician Cai Shi-de, and Han Duo-feng, Zhang Yunrong, and others. In addition, there were more than 100 guards. His wife and son were also traveling with him. It was already 8:30. With the sound of the whistle, the special train headed north. Han bid farewell and got off the train. Feng saw him off at the train door, bowed, and they parted. (7th)</p>
<h3>Military Investigation Team Members Li and Fan Arrive in Jinan</h3>
<p>To Inspect the Situation of the Two Armies in Jiaodong</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Although the military actions between the Han and Liu armies in Jiaodong have ceased for many days, conflicts still occur from time to time because the two sides' positions are close to each other. The situation is still serious. Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Military Affairs Minister He Yingqin, in order to understand the situation in Jiaodong, specially dispatched Li Yue, Major General Counselor of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and Fan Yuhuang, Colonel Staff Officer, to Shandong to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the positions of the two armies, report the truth to the central government, supervise the two armies to implement a ceasefire, and then the central government will properly plan the second step of a solution. After receiving the order, Li and Fan arrived in Jinan on the Jinpu Line train No. 2 at 9:28 AM today (the 6th). Han Fu-qu sent Zhang Lianjia and Zhang Shouqian to welcome them at the station. After Li and Fan got off the train, Zhang and others accompanied them by car to the Jiaoji Hotel for rest. At noon, Zhang and others accompanied them to the provincial government to meet with Chairman Han Fu-qu. They had a very pleasant conversation. Han said, "It's great that you two have come to Shandong. I don't need to say anything more about the Jiaodong affairs. You can see for yourselves when you go to the front." Li and Fan decided to go to the front for inspection early on the 8th. Han immediately sent Zhang Shouqian to accompany them. The planned route is to first go to Weixian, then transfer to a car to Shahe. Li Yue will also go to Yexian City to meet with Liu Zhennian. This afternoon at 5 PM, Zhang Lianjia hosted a banquet for Li and Fan at the Jiaoji Hotel, with important military and political figures from the province in attendance. Han Fu-qu is also scheduled to host a banquet for Li and Fan at the provincial government at 10 AM tomorrow (the 7th). Li and others released the following brief statement today: "We have come to Shandong this time under the order of the Ministry of Military Affairs to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the front lines of the two armies in Jiaodong and report the truth to the central government. The task is very simple, and we have no opinions or suggestions to express. However, we know that the central government and the Ministry of Military Affairs are properly planning a solution to the Jiaodong issue, and we sincerely hope that a peaceful solution can be found. We have already met Chairman Han at the provincial government this afternoon. We plan to go to the front for inspection early on the 8th. Chairman Han has appointed Counselor Zhang Shouqian to accompany us. I (Li Yue speaking) will go to Yexian City to investigate the position of the Liu army after arriving in Shahe, while Staff Officer Fan will be responsible for investigating the situation of the Han army position. As for the investigation period, the Ministry of Military Affairs has not set a limit, but we plan not to stay at the front for too long," and so on. (6th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Returns to Fujian</h3>
<p>Plans to Stay for a Week Before Returning to Nanjing</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: National Government Chairman Lin Sen, accompanied by two staff members, returned to Fujian by the Wanchang steamer from Shanghai on the 1st of this month. On the 3rd, he arrived in the province. The Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the heads of various departments of the Pacification Headquarters all went to Mawei on the morning of that day to welcome him. At 1 PM, the ship arrived at Mawei. He disembarked and entered the Naval Association. After the welcomers paid their respects, he went to the province first. Chairman Lin left Jiang Guangnai and Fang Shengtao for lunch at the Naval Association. During the meal, he inquired in detail about the recent situation in Fujian. At 3 PM, he boarded the Weifeng steamship provided by the Naval Public Office and went to the province. He disembarked at Taijiang and took the provincial government's car to the Naval Club outside the Water Gate for a hot spring bath. Provincial Government Member Lin Zhiyuan, Civil Affairs Commissioner Liu Tong, Public Security Bureau Director Wang Mao, and others set up a banquet at the club to welcome Lin. It was past 7 PM in the evening when he returned to his private residence in Chengputou, Cangqianshan. On the morning of the 4th, his old friends went to Lin's residence to pay their respects, and Lin met with them one by one. In the afternoon, Lin accompanied Lin Zhiyuan to inspect the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the Pacification Headquarters, and various party, government, and military organs. At 3 PM, he took a steamship from Xiadou back to his hometown of Shanggan to participate in the autumn sacrifice at the ancestral hall. Shanggan is the largest township under the jurisdiction of Minhou County, with thousands of households all surnamed Lin. Last year, after Lin Sen was elected chairman, the clansmen held a grand celebration in the ancestral hall, lighting lanterns and performing operas for several days. They also repaired the ancestral hall according to the precedents of previous dynasties, and renamed the ancestral hall to the ancestors who held high positions in the central government, and the project was completed this summer. Recently, the first autumn sacrifice was held. Lin is likely to participate in this event. After the sacrifice, Lin went to Qingzhi Temple in Guanjiang to inspect the project of his own tomb, which he had built while still alive. He will probably stay for about a week before returning to Nanjing. However, the clansmen are urging him to stay until a welcome meeting is held. As for the society, it is widely rumored that Lin's return to Fujian is related to the reorganization of the provincial government and the resolution of the provincial defense army. (October 4th)</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Chen's Department in Fujian Province Agrees to Downsize</h3>
<p>One Brigade's Weapons Confiscated; After Downsizing, to Go to the Front to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Chen Guohui, Brigade Commander of the 1st Mixed Brigade of the Fujian Provincial Defense Army, was detained by Pacification Commissioner Jiang Guangnai on September 27th. The Pacification Headquarters has now received an order from the Executive Yuan to hand Chen Guohui over to the military court for trial. As for the vacancy of the brigade commander, it will be filled by the deputy brigade commander Hong Wende, who was appointed by the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government, and is awaiting resolution. However, the regimental commanders of the brigade, Peng Tong, Chen Peiyu, Chen Yucai, and Lin Shangxuan, etc., upon hearing the news that Chen Guohui was detained in the province, immediately gathered their troops in Xianyou, about 12,000 people, and dug trenches at the junction of Hui'an, Nan'an, Yongchun, and Dehua, preparing to refuse provincial orders. The brigade chief of staff Qi Zuyi and chief counselor Chen Changhou were also arrested by Mao Wei's division of the 19th Route Army stationed in Quanzhou on September 30th for conspiring to make changes in Nan'an. In recent days, the 19th Route Army has been searching for Chen's remaining party members in Jinjiang, Nan'an, Hui'an, and Yongchun. The troops of Chen's department stationed in Jiudu, Nan'an, Pengzhai, Jinjiang, and Shanding, Hui'an, were also surrounded and disarmed by Mao's division. Therefore, there is a saying that Mao's division and Chen's department opened fire at the junction of Xianyou and Yongchun. The Xianyou area is extremely chaotic. Chen's department ordered the Chamber of Commerce to supply 100 dan of rice every day for military rations. People with a little property have fled to Putian to prevent looting by defeated soldiers. The Supplementary Brigade of the 19th Route Army stationed in the province was led by Brigade Commander Tan Qixiu and two regiments, Chen Renzhi and Zheng Xingcha, to Yongtai on the 2nd to attack Xianyou. Only one battalion was left to defend Fuzhou. The acting chairman of the provincial government, Fang Shengtao, is still very passive and listens to Jiang Guangnai's command on the military affairs in southern Fujian and has no opinion to express. However, it is heard that National Government Chairman Lin Sen may mediate this matter. (October 3rd)</p>
<p>Another Dispatch: (1) After hearing the news of Chen Guohui's detention, all parties in Xianyou were quite panicked. All schools were suspended, and many families with little property also moved. (2) Mao's division in Huyang is still fifty li away from Chen's department in Xianyou. The news that the two sides have contacted should be due to Chen's department stationed in Quanzhou and the Yongchun garrison being disarmed or personnel being guarded by Mao's division. (3) Cai Tingkai arrived in Quanzhou from Zhangzhou on the 2nd. Tao Shunchu, the county magistrate of Putian County, immediately went to Quanzhou with Tang, the deputy adjutant of the 1st Brigade of the province, to ask for instructions on downsizing. After receiving instructions from Cai, he returned to Xianyou. He will report everything to the province tomorrow or the day after (the 5th). (4) All the soldiers of Chen's brigade expressed their compliance with the order to replace the brigade commander with Hong Wende after receiving the telegrams from Jiang Guangnai and Fang Shengtao. Yu, the chief of staff of the brigade, and Chen Peiyu, the regimental commander, and others telegraphed to request permission to transfer their departments to the front to suppress the communists. Hong Wende has already replied by telegram, agreeing to come to the province from Xiamen for instructions in order to return to Xianyou to handle the downsizing. Once the downsizing is completed, they can leave Xianyou. (October 5th)</p>
<h3>Japan Establishes a Large Aviation Company in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Will Connect with the Siberian Air Route</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondence: Japan is now establishing a large aviation company in the Northeast, called the "Manchuria International Aviation Co., Ltd." It officially opened at the end of last month. The investors are the Japanese government, the South Manchuria Railway Company, and the Sumitomo Company. The routes that have already been opened are between Dalian and Shenyang, and between Sinuiju, Shenyang, and Changchun. It is planned to add the Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, and Manzhouli lines next spring to connect with the Soviet Russian Siberian air route. Japan has long established a regular air route between Tokyo and Dalian, which now operates once a day. If the Manchuria Aviation Company's connection with Russia is successful next year, mail from Tokyo to Geneva will only take four days. The Japanese will increasingly control the aviation rights in the Northeast. (October 5th)</p>
<h3>Educational Circles in Beiping Request that Beiping Be Designated as a City of Culture</h3>
<p>Listing Reasons to Preserve Culture; All Military Equipment Moved to Baoding</p>
<p>Hoping that Beiping Will Become Like Switzerland</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Jiang Han, Liu Fu, Xu Bingchang, Ma Heng, Zhu Qizhao and more than 30 people from the educational circles in Beiping, given that the stationed troops in Beiping, should accidents occur in the future, the relics stored will suffer huge losses, held a meeting on the 21st of last month to discuss. It was decided to propose to the government to designate Beiping as a city of culture, remove military equipment, and Liu Fu drafted a statement of opinion, which was publicly recommended by Jiang Han to petition the government. It has now been decided that Ma Heng will represent them in Nanjing to discuss the matter. Ma left Beiping southward at 5 PM on the 5th, planning to contact all parties first after arriving in Nanjing, state his opinions, and formally submit the statement of opinion to the government on Double Tenth Day. The original text of the statement of opinion is copied as follows:</p>
<p>Beiping, this place, analyzed by nature, is a collection of political, military, and cultural regions. Before June of the 17th year of the Republic of China, Beijing was the capital of China and the first political region in the country. Later, the capital was moved south, and Beiping lost its importance in Chinese politics. Although a Political Affairs Committee is still set up, it is the political center of North China. Thoroughly speaking, this Political Affairs Committee is not necessary to be set up in Beiping. For the convenience of transportation, Tianjin is better than Beiping. The reason why it is set up in Beiping is only because there are vacant houses that can be borrowed, plus the general public's nostalgia for Beiping's importance in past political history, so it is still recognized as a secondary political region. In order to follow suit, Beiping's military region followed the political region. In the past, since the central government was located here, it should naturally have corresponding military facilities, the so-called "guarding the capital" is necessary both in fact and in the national system. However, Beiping itself is an open place and cannot be set up as a fortress, and has no military importance. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, when Japan proposed the Twenty-One Demands, the Beijing government ordered the General Staff Headquarters to jointly invite Chinese and foreign military experts from the Ministry of the Army and Navy to hold a national defense conference, and the experts went to inspect places such as Gubeikou and Nankou in person. The results showed that once there was a conflict between China and Japan, excluding the three eastern provinces and the coastal provinces, focusing on North China, the first defense line should be at Shanhaiguan. If Shanhaiguan cannot be defended, Tianjin and Beiping will definitely not be able to be defended. Therefore, the important town in North China should be Baoding, with Chengde in Rehe and Zhangjiakou in Chahar as secondary points. Beiping's ability to be a cultural region naturally followed the political region. If Beiping had not been able to serve as the capital of China for the past few hundred years, and had not been able to concentrate the talents and economy of the whole of China in one place, and managed it extremely well, I am afraid that today's Beiping would be no more than a county town like other ordinary counties in Hebei, or at most just like Baoding. Now the question we want to study is this: Beiping's political region has now reached a point where it is insignificant. Should its military and cultural regions still coexist in parallel, or should there be a focus? In our opinion, the military region and the cultural region cannot coexist in one place. A place that is a military region must prepare for war, while a cultural region cannot withstand war. Therefore, to focus on military affairs, all cultural facilities must be moved away. Then, which one should be moved away? Let us calmly study it.</p>
<p>First, as mentioned earlier, Beiping's political region has reached a point where it is insignificant. That is to say, it is okay to set it up in Beiping or not to set it up in Beiping. Even if it is set up in Beiping, it is different from the previous central government, and there is no need to set up troops to guard it.</p>
<p>Second, although Beiping is said to be a military region, in fact, there are no fixed military facilities, only some troops are stationed, and these troops are not fixed, and they are not specially trained to defend Beiping or maintain Beiping's security. They are only the guards of the actual rulers, and the strength of these rulers is not in the troops in Beiping City. When other aspects of the road are impassable, although Beiping still has some troops, they are useless. This can be proved by past facts.</p>
<p>Third, Beiping itself has no military importance, as mentioned earlier. Moreover, with the increasingly severe air warfare now, before a formal conflict, the enemy will first use aircraft to bomb our rear headquarters and various warehouses to shake the morale of the army. From this point of view, Beiping's target is too big. Therefore, setting up a military region in Beiping is not only not beneficial to national defense, but also harmful.</p>
<p>Fourth, it is difficult to collect cultural items, but it is very easy to lose them. The important reasons for the loss are war and relocation.</p>
<p>Fifth, cultural buildings cannot be moved.</p>
<p>Sixth, because Beiping has various cultural facilities, most of the specialized scholars of various disciplines in the country gather in Beiping, creating a cultural atmosphere that represents national civilization and earns honor for the country internationally. This atmosphere cannot be cultivated overnight. Once all the cultural facilities in Beiping are moved away, these scholars will inevitably disperse. To create such a cultural atmosphere again elsewhere is probably not an easy task.</p>
<p>Based on the above six reasons, the first three explain that moving the military equipment from Beiping is beneficial and harmless to national defense, and there is no practical difficulty. The latter three explain that if the cultural equipment of Beiping is to be moved away, it is not only impossible in practice, but also tantamount to reducing the cultural atmosphere that has been cultivated for hundreds of years. Therefore, we advocate requesting the government to designate Beiping as a city of culture and move all military equipment to Baoding. The police will be fully responsible for the security of Beiping. The responsibility for maintaining local security has always been shared by both the military and the police. In fact, the police force is probably the majority, and the army is only in a very weak supporting position. Our purpose is to reduce the possibility of Beiping's cultural facilities being hit by artillery fire. Of course, the enemy's morality should be considered. Perhaps we will remove the military equipment, and the enemy will still create all kinds of false accusations in order to destroy Beiping's culture. We naturally have no way to think about this, but Beiping is the seat of foreign envoys, and we may as well assume that there is not such a great and barbaric nation in the world that dares to destroy cultural facilities that have no resistance under the public gaze. Therefore, we can first do our best. All the cultural items in Beiping, such as the Stone Drums collected by Confucius, the Yin Shang oracle bones collected by the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica, the Han Dynasty wooden slips excavated by the Northwest Science Expedition, the Yuan Dynasty murals in the Peking University, the Siku Quanshu, Dunhuang scriptures, and other rare books collected by the Beiping Library, and the Chao Dynasty's national music for offering sacrifices to heaven collected in the Temple of Heaven, are all treasures with unparalleled value in Chinese cultural history, and even in world cultural history, and can be called national treasures. As for the architecture and treasures of the Forbidden City and the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Hall, they are especially admired by museums all over the world. Even though the instruments of various universities and research institutes are not as good as those of foreign universities, they are much more complete than those of other universities and research institutes in the country. These things, to put it lightly, are enough to promote national glory, and to put it deeply, they are the place where the national lifeline and national spirit are entrusted. Their importance does not lie in the amount of money they are worth, but in the fact that most of them cannot be purchased after they are destroyed, and the value of money cannot be calculated. Although everyone in our country has the determination to sacrifice, the cultural items that promote national glory, entrust the national lifeline, and the national spirit must not be sacrificed. If these things are sacrificed, what exactly are we fighting for when we sacrifice everything? We hope that the future Beiping will be like Switzerland in Europe, never invaded by war, and like Oxford and Cambridge in England, always immersed in the clear spring of culture. We hope that the government will accept our request, and we hope that the military authorities with broad vision will earnestly support us. We hope that the politicians and activists of all countries in the world who love peace and culture will give us appropriate help to prove everything. (6th)</p>

<h3>Ways to Exploit Shaanxi Coal</h3>
<p>After geologist Mr. Huang Boda completed his investigation of the northern Shaanxi coalfields, he had the following opinions on the ways to exploit Shaanxi coal:</p>
<p>I (Mr. Huang referring to himself), representing the China Mining Society, participated in the Shaanxi Industrial Investigation Group this time. I traveled through more than ten counties, covering a distance of more than two thousand miles. The general situation and opinions are briefly described as follows: (1) The mines investigated include the Xincun Gou, Hui Tui Po, Bai Gong Miao, and Chenjia River mines in Tongguan County; the Yaoxian Village in Yijun County; the Jia Gou, Zhangjia Gou, Qilizhen, and Houziping mines; and the Zhuyuan, Shijia Gou, Quan Yu Gou, Er Gou, and Xi Gou mines in Hancheng County. (2) Coal price survey: The coal price in the Xi'an area is surprisingly high. The coal price in Xi'an is about more than forty yuan per ton. According to the Construction Department, the highest price was once two hundred yuan per ton. The coal prices in other counties are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Xi'an 44.2 yuan Tongguan 10.2 yuan</p>
<p>Xianyang 44.2 yuan Fushi 10.2 yuan</p>
<p>Sanyuan 24.65 yuan Yanchang 11.9 yuan</p>
<p>Yaoxian 8.5 yuan Yichuan 28.9 yuan</p>
<p>Yijun 8.5 yuan Gancheng 10.2 yuan</p>
<p>中部 (中部) 9.35 yuan Taiyang 14 yuan</p>
<p>Luochuan 11.9 yuan</p>
<p>(3) Estimated coal reserves: According to general estimates, calculating the coal seam thickness at 4, 5, or 6 meters seems overly optimistic. In this survey, the Yijun coal seam thickness varied from 4 feet to 8 feet, with an average of 2 meters. The Tongguan coal seam thickness varied from 6 feet to 8 feet, with an average of 2 meters. The Hancheng coal seam thickness can be calculated at 1.6 meters. However, due to the brief nature of the visit, the strike, dip, and extent of each coalfield could not be measured. The following is a summary of the estimated coal reserves based on Mr. Qu Guobin's records:</p>
<p>(A) Yijun coalfield: Approximately 40,000 meters long from north to south and approximately 3,000 meters wide from east to west, with a coal seam thickness of approximately 2 meters. Assuming a specific gravity of 1, the coal reserves should be 240 million tons. (B) Tongguan coalfield: Approximately 72,000 meters long and approximately 4,800 meters wide, with a varying coal seam thickness. Using 2 meters for calculation and assuming a specific gravity of 1, the coal reserves should be approximately 340 million tons. (C) Hancheng coalfield: Approximately 6,000 meters long and approximately 12,000 meters wide, with a coal seam thickness of 1.6 meters and a specific gravity of 1, the coal reserves should be approximately 115 million tons. The total coal reserves in the above three locations are approximately 173 million tons. (D) The Jurassic coal seams in counties such as Yao County, Fushi, and Yanchang are about 2 feet thick. Local people use primitive mining methods and are still able to profit. Any mine that can be profitably extracted from the ground and sold in the market has exploitation value. Therefore, the coal in counties such as Yao County, Fushi, and Yanchang should not be considered absolutely worthless. The coal reserves could not be estimated due to the unknown length and width.</p>
<p>(4) Reasons for high coal prices: The high coal prices in Xi'an and other places are purely due to transportation difficulties, not to particularly high coal mining costs. The selling price of coal in the mining areas is about two yuan per ton, such as in Hancheng and Yijun. The highest is no more than four yuan, such as in Chenjia River, Tongguan. The coal mining cost in Tongguan is about two yuan, and in Yijun and Hancheng it is about one to two yuan. It is clear that the coal mining cost is not particularly high. The biggest difficulty is transportation. Most coal-producing areas are mountainous and rely on animals for transportation. Hancheng Coal Mine also uses the Yellow River to transport coal. The situation is briefly described as follows: (A) From the mine to Wanmenkou, a distance of 15 li, manual transportation costs 2.8 yuan per ton (4 jiao per 240 jin). From Yu Menkou to Di Kai Shui by water, 8.4 yuan per ton (1.2 yuan per 240 jin). The total transportation cost from the mine to Huguan is 11.2 yuan per ton. (B) From the mine to Ping Yu Menkou, manual transportation costs 2.8 yuan per ton. From Yu Menkou to Baiyangzhai, water transport costs 12.6 yuan per ton. From Baiyangzhai to Xi'an, manual transportation costs 16.8 yuan per ton. The total transportation cost from the mine to Xi'an is 32.2 yuan. From this, it can be seen that the failure to develop the northern Shaanxi coalfields is purely a transportation problem, not excessive coal mining costs.</p>
<p>(5) Development Approaches: The Shaanxi Basin produces coal in both the center and the edges. The Jurassic coal seams are in the center of the basin. The thickness of the coal seams varies greatly, and there are many intermediate strata, so the ash content is particularly high and the sulfur content is also heavy, as in the Yijun coal mine. The Carboniferous-Permian coal seams are on the edge of the basin. The average thickness of the coal seams is about 2 meters, and the coal quality is quite good. The rocks above and below the coal seams are sandstone, and there is very little need for timber supports, as in Tongguan and Hancheng. If you want to develop the Shaanxi coalfields, it seems more advantageous to start with the Tongguan and Hancheng coal mines. Hancheng is 245 li from Tongguan, and can be sold overseas via the sea route. It is about 270-280 li from Qunxian. The area already has an arsenal. If Huayin is established as an industrial zone, the coal consumption will be significant. Along the way, counties such as Taiyang, Dali, and Chaoyi consume about 100,000 shun of coal per year. In the future, high-altitude light rail should be built for transportation in mountainous areas, and light rails can be built on flat ground. Tongguan is 245 li from Xianyang. Xianyang is a planned route for the sea route and can be transported outwards. If Xianyang is established as an industrial zone, it can also consume a large amount of coal. However, transporting and selling coal eastward from Xianyang requires an additional one yuan per ton. The transportation cost for importing raw materials and exporting products eastward will also be higher than in Huayin. Therefore, I believe that it would be more convenient to establish an industrial zone in Huayin than in Xianyang. If Huayin is designated as an industrial expense area, then the development of the Gancheng coalfield should be prioritized over Tongguan. The large-scale mining of coal seams and the method of transportation still require further research. Some advocate using the Yellow River for transportation, but the Yellow River's riverbed changes unpredictably and the transportation cost is surprisingly high, so it does not seem to have any exploitation value.

<h3>The Mid-Autumn Festival Without Moonlight</h3>
<p>Heaven seems to be as fickle as a woman. On the morning of the 13th,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>just as we were about to depart from Taiyang, it started raining again. At 7 o'clock, we ate in the drizzling rain. From 8 to 10 o'clock, we exchanged opinions with local people from all walks of life in Taiyang. From 10 to 12 o'clock, we all attended a welcoming party. At about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, after lunch, we set off for Lujing Town with our rain gear.</p>
<p>That day's journey was only 40 li. Those of us on horseback arrived in two hours. By then, the rain had stopped, but the sky was covered with dark clouds. Heaven still had a long face, as if it had something unpleasant to vent. Although Lujing Town is a town, it has solid city walls on all sides, and there are several shops in the city. The scale is comparable to that of a small county. That night, we looked up, but could not find the bright moon of the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival in the dark sky. Originally, the Mid-Autumn moon is exceptionally bright. Who stole the joy of this year's moon goddess, hiding her bright and beautiful face, so that she could not meet our lonely travelers!</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th, the sky was still covered with rain, and the cold north wind blew against our backs, making us feel not only that the cool autumn of September was coming to an end, but also that the severe winter was approaching step by step. At 11 o'clock, we arrived at Fangquan Town from Lujing Town. Many people in the town died in the past due to the rampant tiger plague. While we were resting and eating, we saw swarms of flies, like black clouds, landing on the food. It is truly impossible to prevent the tiger plague from raging. By then, the rain had stopped and the weather had warmed up a little. Those of us on horseback, at about 12:30, rushed forward desperately, completing the 40-li journey in two hours, and arriving at our last investigation area, Dali County.</p>
<p>Dali is the former Tongzhou. The market is very prosperous. Every month on the 3rd, 7th, etc., is the period of commercial gatherings, and the three days of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the 14th, 15th, and 16th, are the busiest sales period of the year. When we entered the city, we saw a sea of people in the streets, and tiny-footed rebellious women walking in the streets with delicate steps, almost making us doubt that the 18th century was about to be resurrected. According to local people, the area of the county is about more than 6,000 hectares, the circumference of the city is about 9 li, it is slightly longer east-west and narrower north-south, the population of the county is about 100,000, the city has about 12,000 people, and there are about 200-300 shops. When I arrived at my accommodation, I met Li Yuhua, the director of the Education Bureau, Li Baoqing, the director of the Finance Bureau, and Gao Tianmin, the director of the Construction Bureau.</p>
<p>They provided me with a lot of information. The statistics of various specialties are roughly as follows:</p>

<p>As for education, there are 5 complete elementary schools, 5 junior elementary schools, 11 people's schools, a vocational supplementary school, a girls' elementary school, and a people's education center. The education expenditure of the Education Bureau is about 4,320 yuan per year, 3,000 yuan for the First Elementary School, 560 yuan for the Second Elementary School, 840 yuan for the Third Elementary School, 720 yuan for the Fourth Elementary School, 540 yuan for the Fifth Elementary School, 2,520 yuan for the Vocational Supplementary School, 2,160 yuan for the Girls' Elementary School, 444 yuan for the Model Junior Elementary School, 252 yuan for the First Junior Elementary School, 228 yuan for the Second Junior Elementary School, 22 yuan for the Third Junior Elementary School, 252 yuan for the Fourth Junior Elementary School, 720 yuan for the People's Education Center, and 160 yuan for each People's School. The total is about 18,944 yuan. The sources are about 9,000 yuan from local administrative expenses, 1,200 yuan from rent, 600 yuan from interest, 2,100 yuan from land rent, 260 yuan from grain merchants' donations, 1,000 yuan from official market donations, 700 yuan from flower merchants' donations, 900 yuan from leather goods donations, 120 yuan from brokers' donations, and 3,100 yuan from miscellaneous taxes, totaling about 19,080 yuan. The salaries of the staff are 30 yuan per month for the director of the Education Bureau, 20 yuan for the principal, 20 yuan for the director of the Education Fund Management Office, 17 yuan for the document clerk, 15 yuan for the secretary, 17 yuan for the office worker, 15 yuan for the education commissioner, 24 yuan for the principal, 22 yuan for the director of studies, 20 yuan for the senior homeroom teacher, 18 yuan for the junior homeroom teacher, and 20 yuan for the director of the People's Education Center. Other situations are omitted due to time constraints. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Reconvening the Millennium Gathering: The elderly people in this county, aged 60 and above, once gathered to form the Millennium Gathering. They held two general meetings every year, feasting and celebrating at famous scenic spots. This spring, due to the Shanghai war, it was not held. Now, elders such as Geng Boqi, Xiao Yuan, and Cai Zhongyu believe that it is very appropriate to continue the 30th Autumn Gathering in this clear and refreshing autumn. They have decided to hold a meeting at the Fire Brigade Association on the 15th of this month, and have already informed elders from all over the region to attend on time. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<p>Elementary School Teacher Suicide: Wang Guixiang, a teacher who used to work at the County Experimental Elementary School and is from Changzhou, committed suicide because he failed to find a job in Shanghai and was living in the Experimental School. The previous night, he had the idea of committing suicide. He bought sleeping pills and swallowed them secretly. Fortunately, his colleagues noticed that his expression was different and also knew that he had attempted suicide in the Wusong River several times without success. Therefore, he was immediately sent to Songjiang Hospital for treatment. It is said that he took a heavy dose and his life has not yet been saved.</p>

<p>Combined Collection of Land Survey and Mu Tax: The land survey and mu tax of this county were previously decided by the budget meeting of the 21st year to be suspended for one year, but the order was rejected by the department.

<p>Correspondence</p>
<h3>Letter from the Construction Bureau of Changshu County</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I have read a news item in the local communication column of your esteemed newspaper on the 3rd of this month, which stated that local people and various organizations in our county oppose the levy of additional land tax for water conservancy. I am extremely surprised. After investigation, it has been determined that the levy of additional land tax for water conservancy in our county last year was limited to one year. The funds collected were designated for local dredging of waterways and were not remitted to the province. The levy of this additional land tax has been discontinued this year. As of today, the Construction Department has not issued any orders to the county to continue the levy. How could local people and various organizations express opposition? The information reported in your newspaper is completely inconsistent with the facts. I am writing to request that you investigate and correct the report.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Head of the Affairs Section of the Construction Bureau of Changshu County,</p>
<p>October 7th</p>

<h3>The Westerners' First Division League: Chinan Wins Over British Navy in First Match</h3>
<p>11-0</p>
<p>Jiang and Chen Deserve Great Credit</p>
<p>In the Westerners' Football League, Chinan played their first match yesterday against the British Navy at Yiyuan. After 90 minutes of play, Chinan swept through, defeating them by eleven goals and returning in triumph.</p>
<p>Strength Is Worlds Apart</p>
<p>Chinan's army is nimble and can be called a formidable opponent. When Qiu Dongyan returns in the future, the inner defense will be even more impressive. Yesterday, the opponent was too weak, and the situation became one-sided. The midfield line's advance and retreat, offense and defense, were extremely capable. The forwards were quite sharp, but they sometimes made mistakes due to confusion. Jiang Shanqing's bold and forceful leg and Chen Zhenhe's lively and vigorous body were the most appreciated by the audience. Among the British Navy, it was difficult to find a better talent, except for the goalkeeper Davis.</p>
<p>Five Goals in a Row</p>
<p>At 3:00, referee Fult brought the ball into the stadium. With a whistle, Chinan deployed in the sun and began to attack the British army. Xiao Hei Tan passed the ball to Luo Haiguang, but it was blocked by Klaison. He quickly passed it short to Liu Zukan. Before Liu could make a few moves, Kelai chased it back. White, the enemy's center forward, dribbled the ball towards Chinan's defensive zone. Xu Yahui came out halfway, got the ball and passed it to Hong Bao, who went straight into the enemy's territory along the side. From afar, Luo Haiguang caught up and kicked it, but it bounced back from the goalpost. Xiao Hei Tan waited on the right and raised his foot to shoot, but Bairem rushed to interfere. Chen Zhenxiang found an opportunity to shoot, and the ball went into the net. In less than three minutes, Chen Zhenxiang's ball was intercepted, and Liang Shutang stole the ball back and passed it far to Haiguang. Under the watchful eyes of three enemies, Luo passed it beautifully over the enemy's defensive line. Xiao Hei Tan was as fast as a horse. Back and White could not stop him, and Davis was waiting to be tied up. Thus, Chinan scored another goal. Who would have thought that less than two minutes after the kickoff, Liu Zukan hooked a ball from the baseline and sent it to the center. Chen Zhenxiang nodded and the ball went into the goal again. From then on, Chinan was full of energy and invincible. Xu Yahui blocked two cars with one horse.</p>
<p>He jumped up and headed the ball to the side of Mei Hongbao. Thus, the iron cavalry of Chinan was seen again in the enemy's territory. They charged left and right, and the enemy had difficulty parrying. Chen Zhenxiang kicked the ball out of Davis's hands, and Luo Haiguang caught up and fired again, hitting the red mark. The enemy had lost four goals in a row, and their morale was greatly reduced. Almost half of the eastern part of the field was trampled by our national athletes. Liu Zukan fired a returning shot, and Xiao Hei Tan was also good at firing a head-on shot. The ball was headed out by Klaison for more than ten feet, and Luo Haiguang and Bairem kicked it at the same time. With a bang, the ball was kicked into the enemy's goal. The score was 5-1 in the first half.</p>
<p>A Half Dozen in One Go</p>
<p>After the attack, they decided the winner again. The British army was still depressed and had no counter-attacking power or defensive skills. Chen Zhenhe, with the assistance of Xu Yahui, broke through three levels and the enemy surrounded him. Tan Shi was cunning and sent the ball with his toe to the left wing. Liu Zukan swept across and the enemy's gate was lost again. Before three minutes had passed, Chen Zhenhe stole the ball from the enemy's goalkeeper and put it into the net. Not long after, Mei Hongshi took a corner kick, and Chen Zhenxiang was right on the spot to head it into the goal again from the shoulder of the enemy defender. The numbers were already shocking, but Liu Zukan and Chen Zhenhe were still not lenient and continued to score a goal. The British army then returned in dismay with a score of 0-11. The lineups of the two teams are attached below:</p>

<h3>Song and Wang Met Yesterday</h3>
<p>Results Temporarily Unannounced</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Song Ziwen, the acting Premier of the Executive Yuan, flew from Nanjing to Shanghai the day before yesterday to meet with Wang, urging him to return to Nanjing and to seek Wang's opinion on the report issued by the League of Nations investigation team. Song and Wang met yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Met with Wang Yesterday: Yesterday, Song Ziwen went out at 9:00 AM, first visiting the residence of Japanese Minister Arimayoshi Akira on Avenue Petain. After departing, he went to Wang's residence for a secret meeting arranged in advance. Song returned to his residence at 10:00 AM and met with Li Yunchao, the representative of Zhang Xueliang, followed by Finance Minister Zou Lin, and former 19th Route Army Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan. Weng left after about half an hour. At 1:30 PM, Song went out again, first visiting the residence of Chu Minyi on Avenue Albert, then meeting with Wang, returning to his residence at 5:30 PM. Going to Nanjing Tomorrow: Yesterday, when Song returned to his residence, reporters asked about the results of his meeting with Wang. Song did not deny that he came to Shanghai to urge Wang to return and to seek his opinion on the report, but he did not reveal a single word about the results of the meeting. When asked when he would return to Nanjing, he replied that he would go to Nanjing on Monday morning (i.e., tomorrow). Chu's Remarks: Chu Minyi, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday with Finance Minister Song Ziwen. Yesterday, reporters visited Chu at his residence. Chu made the following remarks: "Finance Minister Song met with Wang today. Wang stated that due to his current sick leave, he could not express his opinion on the League of Nations report and requested Song to express his opinion on his behalf. Song was still being modest. As for Wang's condition, I took his stool sample to Nanjing last week for examination by the Ministry of Health. The results showed that the stool contained liver fluke eggs. According to the doctor, he needs a long period of rest. He is currently receiving various anti-parasitic injections. I must return to Nanjing tomorrow (i.e., today). The report of the League of Nations investigation team will be discussed by the Special Foreign Affairs Committee as soon as Song returns to Nanjing."</p>
<p>Li Yunchao's Talk: Zhang Xueliang's representative, Li Yunchao, met with reporters yesterday morning when he visited Song Ziwen. He said briefly that Zhang Hanqing's trip to Wuhan was just a rumor from the past, and he had not heard of it recently, so he did not know if it was true. He was in Shanghai to recuperate and did not plan to return north unless something happened. Donald would also come to Shanghai from Nanjing in the coming days because he was also not in good health, so he would come to Shanghai to recuperate soon.</p>
<h3>Chengdu Chamber of Commerce Responds to Anti-War League Telegram</h3>
<p>Earnestly Presenting the Sufferings of Sichuan Province</p>
<p>The General Association of the League to Abolish Internal War received a telegram from the Chengdu Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which reads: "To the General Association of the League to Abolish Internal War: We have received your letter and telegram. Since the founding of the Republic of China, Sichuan Province has been regarded by the central government as an uncivilized land, left to be occupied by military men who claim to be heroes. Wars are frequent, occurring every year. The oppression of the people, such as pre-collection of taxes, forced loans, and exorbitant taxes, is unprecedented and more severe than in other provinces. Even without any major events, the people are already unable to bear the burden. Now, Chengdu and Chongqing are mobilizing and deploying troops again. As your telegram states, it is clear that once the war breaks out, those who sacrifice their lives are the workers and farmers who are forced into military service, and those who lose their property are our law-abiding masses. However, after careful consideration of the environment and weighing the advantages and disadvantages, it is better to die with patience than to die from ineffective treatment. The ancients said, 'Stopping killing with killing' is what we pray for day and night. The General Association leads the country and advocates for the abolition of war. Regardless of whether your efforts will be effective in the future, we hope that you will rely on the people and not be used by any party. Plan concrete strategies and coordinate national salvation measures so that our compatriots can rest and recuperate when the war is over and not be subjected to various harsh policies. Then, the members of our association will lead tens of thousands of merchants in the city to follow in the footsteps of the gentlemen of the General Association. We hereby reply to your telegram for your consideration. Sincerely, Chengdu Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>19th Route Army Engineering Team Contacts About Going North to Fight the Enemy</h3>
<p>A portion of the 19th Route Army Engineering Team, totaling over 300 men (formerly the Volunteer Army attached to the camp in Shanghai), has been sent to Shanghai to go north to fight the enemy. This Volunteer Army was originally stationed at the Sun Temple in Zhabei. Later, due to certain reasons, fearing misunderstandings, they moved to another location yesterday. Yesterday, the representative Zheng Yuanqiu, carrying a letter from Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan, contacted the Volunteer Army Support Association to discuss everything. The association expressed its welcome and agreed to find a way. The original letter reads: "Respected Sirs, the engineering team of 300 men, formerly under the command of our unit, is now being disbanded due to the downsizing of our army. I originally planned to go to the Northeast and take them north, but due to various reasons, I was unable to do so. Most of the members of this team are patriotic young men who are eager to fight the enemy. They have now decided to go north on their own. We have always admired your association for its purpose of supporting the Volunteer Army and recovering lost territory. Since its establishment, its achievements have been remarkable. Therefore, we dare to introduce the representative of this team, Zheng Yuanqiu, to you for instructions. We hope that you will grant him an audience and provide practical assistance. Sincerely, Weng Zhaoyuan, to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Coal Mining Companies Requesting Lower Prices for Domestic Coal</h3>
<p>Advising Factory Users to Support Coal Miners by Using Domestic Coal The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a notice yesterday to Zhongxing and twelve other coal mining companies and all industry associations, stating, "It has been investigated that coal used along the Yangtze River, besides joint ventures with foreign capital, which sell millions of tons annually, is mostly Japanese coal and Fushun coal. Since the September 18th Incident, people have switched to domestic coal in hopes of stopping the drain. However, the price difference between domestic coal and Japanese coal is nearly one-third. Recently, Chinese shipping companies also plan to switch to domestic coal, but they claim that the price difference is four taels per ton. If no other subsidies are provided, the increased cost will inevitably lead to bankruptcy during this shipping industry slump. It is clear that domestic coal must lower its price to win the market. Our chamber is aware that Chinese coal mines face difficulties such as a lack of vehicles, delayed transportation, heavy taxes, and immature technology, which increase production costs and prevent price reductions. However, without making efforts to overcome these difficulties, it will be difficult to develop the market. All mines should jointly find ways to lobby the authorities to facilitate transportation and reduce taxes. On the one hand, they should refer to the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce Mining Department Director's suggestion of joint production and sales and establish a joint marketing organization to avoid wasteful competition and save operating expenses. The selling price can then be gradually reduced. This is what the mines should do. On the other hand, factory users in this city should also support each other, understanding the difficulties faced by Chinese mines and the fear of national economic bankruptcy. Rather than increasing profits by using foreign coal, they should be willing to use domestic coal and reduce profits slightly, supporting the miners, which is to preserve industry. Our chamber is willing to use our limited strength and work hard to find a way to benefit both miners and users. We hope you will understand."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegrams Provincial and Municipal Chambers of Commerce to Organize Committees to Promote National Products</h3>
<p>To Achieve the Effect of Collective Wisdom</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed provincial and municipal chambers of commerce yesterday, urging them to form national product promotion committees to maintain local national products. The telegram read: "To all provincial, municipal, and town chambers of commerce: Unfortunately, our country has suffered from both military invasion by Japanese寇 and continuous exploitation by foreign capital. Under this double pressure, the nation is in danger. To reverse this crisis, all merchants in our country must consciously rise up and promote and maintain the inherent national products of each region. To grasp the key, it is particularly important for chambers of commerce in all regions to uniformly organize national product promotion committees to achieve the effect of collective wisdom. In view of this, our chamber, after the inauguration of the second executive supervisory committee, immediately organized a national product promotion committee based on the rules of various committees and actively deliberated, hoping to contribute to national products. However, this matter is significant and cannot be accomplished by Shanghai alone. Therefore, we are issuing this telegram, hoping that you will take note, quickly organize national product promotion committees uniformly to facilitate contact. We deeply hope for your cooperation."</p>
<h3>Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Team Recruiting Members</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Team, organized by Zi Youfei Jian and others, the work has been actively carried out. At the same time, after contacting all parties, satisfactory results have been obtained. It is now reported that the team is recruiting several comrades with medical knowledge because the war zone in the Northeast is very long and the team members are insufficient. Those who have served in hospitals or have considerable surgical experience can register at the team's office at the Oriental Hotel in Xiaodongmen. The internal organization of the team is divided into a general affairs section (also serving as accounting, clerical, and general affairs), a medical section (also serving as nursing; divided into two medical teams), a relief section (divided into four teams: first, second, third, and fourth), and a transport section (also serving as transport and communications; divided into two teams).</p>

<h3>Salt Inspectorate Chief Zhu Inspects Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Zhu Tingqi, Chief of the Salt Inspectorate and Director of the Salt Affairs Department, accompanied Finance Minister Song to Haizhou to inspect the Huaibei salt fields. He is now implementing the Minister's intention to thoroughly rectify the situation, starting with the fields and building warehouses to ensure production and storage, and prevent smuggling. This month, he inspected various fields in Zhejiang and reviewed tax collections and administrative matters. It is reported that after the anti-smuggling matters were merged into the branch office and the position of transport commissioner was concurrently held by the manager of the provincial branch, he was determined to rectify and eliminate long-standing malpractices, with significant results. The annual savings in administrative and anti-smuggling expenses have reached over 400,000 yuan. The tax revenue in the first nine months of this year has increased by more than 460,000 yuan compared to before the inspection. Since the abolition of the Wenshuo contractor in August, tax revenue has increased by tens of thousands of yuan. The tax police are neat and disciplined, which is very different from the past. Large quantities of smuggled salt, ranging from seventy or eighty dan to hundreds of dan, are often seized, which is rare. The annual tax police expenses are reduced by more than 100,000 yuan compared to the past. The management of salt along the 80-90 li coastline of Yuyao, including weighing, collecting, and releasing, is well-organized. As the largest field in Zhejiang, it is planned to start with the personnel there and further tighten the rectification to ensure maximum production and collection as a model for other fields. The policy of changing from boiling to drying salt should also be slightly modified according to local conditions. It is estimated that the annual tax revenue can be increased by several million yuan. He has instructed Feng Ruliang, the manager of the Zhejiang branch and concurrently the salt transport commissioner, to propose measures for implementation as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>British Educator Dr. Clay Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Dr. Clay, a famous British educator, has arrived in Shanghai with his wife to visit their daughter. They will stay for more than a month. Dr. Clay served as the headmaster of Holloway County School in North London for thirty years before retiring last winter due to old age. The London County Council has ten technical education schools, and his school is one of them. This type of technical school was first created by Hogg. Hogg was taking a walk in London one night when he saw a group of children gambling. Feeling sorry that they were wasting their valuable time, he invited them to his residence to teach them technical skills. As the results were excellent, the practice was adopted throughout the city. The ten schools in London initially planned to offer all subjects, but later found it difficult to implement, so each school specialized in several subjects. Holloway County School offered (1) a preparatory class for students seeking a science degree from the University of London, with 400 students; (2) an architecture class with about 1,400 students; (3) a rubber manufacturing class with about 300 students; and (4) a musical instrument manufacturing class with about 400 students. In addition, there was a women's class studying domestic economics and marriage problems. This excellent technical school method can be promoted in our country. It is said that the chief engineer of the Shanghai 浚浦局, Charles Lay, graduated from the architecture class of this school.</p>

<p>Mr. Kuang Bingshun, an overseas Chinese in the United States, has recently partnered with an American business to establish the Chinese American Shipping Company. Its organization has a total of fifteen directors, of which overseas Chinese occupy twelve seats, and American businessmen only three. Mr. Kuang was elected as the general manager and established the head office in San Francisco, with branch offices in Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland. Three diesel-powered engine ships have been leased from the Danish company, East Asiatic Company, with each ship flying the Chinese flag. The first ship, Guangzhou (MS Lutlandia), arrived in Shanghai a week ago and has now set sail for Hong Kong. The second and third ships, MSS "Selandia" and MS Fufstria, will depart from the United States for Shanghai successively at the end of this year and next spring. At that time, a schedule will be arranged, once a month. It is noted that the Guangzhou is very clean and tidy because it is powered by diesel. The ship is 400 feet long, 55 feet wide, with a displacement of 10,500 tons and a deadweight of 7,600 tons. The dining room, smoking room, and conversation rooms are fully equipped. The open deck is spacious, with eleven cabins accommodating forty-five guests.

<h3>Navy Adjutant Zeng Guoxi Suicide</h3>
<p>Returned from Japan, the Reason Unknown</p>
<p>Zeng Guoxi, a Fujianese naval torpedo camp adjutant, was sent to Japan to study torpedoes. He had just graduated and ranked first. He was ordered to return to China by the Ministry a few days ago. After arriving in Shanghai, he stayed for only one day before going to Beijing to report. He was assigned by the Navy Department to the Chuqian warship as a torpedo officer. Unexpectedly, Mr. Zeng, for some unknown reason, suddenly committed suicide with a pistol in the Beijing camp the night before, and died immediately. Later, the Navy Department telegraphed Shanghai to inform his brother, Zeng Guosheng (currently serving as a new ship supervisor). Mr. Zeng was extremely saddened after receiving the news. Minister Chen of the Ministry was also quite saddened after hearing the news and will provide condolences in accordance with regulations. Zeng was 28 years old and worked very hard. His family life was also very fulfilling, so the reason for this suicide is difficult for outsiders to guess. According to reports, Chen Minghui, captain of the Navy Rensheng ship, also committed suicide a month ago due to economic difficulties, so Zeng's death is the second suicide case in the Navy.</p>
<h3>Record of Conflicts Between Hukuai and Merchants in Shanghai Rice Shops</h3>
<p>Merchants Put Forward Conditions and Stop Shipping</p>
<p>Rice Industry Asks Party and Government to Stop It</p>
<p>The Shanghai rice shipping merchants, previously suffering invisible losses due to the use of heavy pecks by the Hukuai in various rice shops, organized a petition to request assistance. The Social Affairs Bureau issued a public notice. Since the arrest of the Hukuai on the 5th, all rice shops uniformly stopped pecking rice on the 6th. After mediation, pecking resumed yesterday morning. Unfortunately, a conflict occurred, and many people were injured. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Public Notice by the Social Affairs Bureau: The Social Affairs Bureau issued a public notice stating that the Lianyi Association of rice shipping merchants in the South City reported that since the Hukuai fee was abolished by the Association's resolution, the Hukuai used heavy pecks, causing considerable losses, and requested relief. The petition was submitted. The Hukuai are workers employed by the rice shops and should act as intermediaries, representing the rice shops to seek fairness for both buyers and sellers. How can they use their skills to implement heavy pecks and collect illegal fees? Moreover, heavy and light pecks have been prohibited by the Bureau's public notice. Now that the Hukuai are using heavy pecks because the rice shipping merchants have abolished the Hukuai fee, it is illegal if true and should be strictly prohibited. In the future, if Hukuai are found to be using heavy or light pecks, or soliciting Hukuai fees,</p>
<p>rice shipping merchants or rice shops are allowed to report to the Bureau. Once verified, they will be severely punished without leniency. Based on the aforementioned situation, a public notice is hereby issued for general knowledge. This notice.</p>
<p>Hukuai Not Opening Pecks: On the 5th of this month, the Social Affairs Bureau received a report from rice shipping merchants that the Hukuai in various rice shops were still using heavy pecks. The Bureau dispatched Mao Shenghe, an official from the Fourth Section, to stop them. Together with the rice shipping merchants, they arrested Yao Heshang, a Hukuai from Hengxingxie Rice Shop, and Zhang Amao, a Hukuai from Juxingsheng Rice Shop, and detained them in the First Precinct, First Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau. All the Hukuai were angered and went on strike, causing the rice shops to stop pecking rice. Fortunately, after the police station inquired, they were released. The Social Affairs Bureau, considering that the suspension of rice pecking had a significant impact on the people's food supply, immediately instructed the Public Security Bureau to resume rice pecking immediately and try to persuade them. It was not until yesterday morning that a solution was reached, and the Hukuai resumed work, and the rice shops resumed pecking rice.</p>
<p>The Cause of the Conflict: Yesterday morning, the Hukuai from various rice shops went to work at the soy and rice industry pier on the Bund. At 10:00 AM, the Shanghai South Rice Shipping Merchants Lianyi Association rushed to the scene, opposing heavy pecks and stopping them. At that time, a conflict occurred between the merchants and the Hukuai. The pier police tried to persuade them, initially interfering with other people's businesses, but were eventually confronted by the merchants, and the police uniform was torn. Policeman Su Shenren was injured. Fortunately, Yi Zuanren, the director of the First Precinct, First Sub-bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, rushed to the scene with police to suppress the situation. Merchants Ren Jinquan, Zou Asong, Zhou Longgui, Shen Jinsheng, and Mu Asong were also injured to varying degrees. The director of the sub-bureau detained the injured merchants Shen Jinsheng and Mu Asong in the police station. The rest of the injured were sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were minor, and they were discharged soon after.</p>
<p>Petition from Merchants: The Shanghai West Rice Shipping Merchants Lianyi Society gathered more than a hundred merchants yesterday morning and organized the "Shanghai South Rice Shipping Petition Group." They submitted a petition to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau requesting: (1) punish Zhu Zixiang and Yan Xiaoquan, rice industry leaders, for instigating the strike to coerce; (2) investigate and punish A Mei, a Hukuai from Wanxing Rice Shop, for instructing Hukuai to use heavy pecks; (3) compensate for losses during the Hukuai strike; (4) re-arrest the Hukuai Zhang Amao and Yao Heshang and severely punish them; (5) deny the qualifications of Hukuai and request that merchants conduct their own pecking; (6) establish fair pecks and eliminate malpractices. Zhou Minggang from the Fourth Section received them and promised to forward the petition to the director for handling.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Went on Strike Yesterday: Yesterday morning, after the conflict between the Hukuai and rice shipping merchants and the injury of Ren Jinquan and others, all the merchants were very indignant. In addition to continuing to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, they also announced a strike at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Meetings of Two Guilds: The Soy and Rice Industry Guild and the Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Guild convened a joint meeting of colleagues from the soy, rice, miscellaneous grains, and oil cakes industries yesterday afternoon on the third floor of the Miscellaneous Grains Guild. Zhu Zixiang reported that the Rice Shipping Lianyi Association was interfering with rice pecking, dragging away Hukuai, and behaving abnormally, resulting in a market closure. After the Social Affairs Bureau advised them to reopen the market, the shops complied with the order and resumed pecking this morning. Unexpectedly, the boat owners gathered sixty or seventy people, rushed to the pier, and prevented rice pecking, even beating and injuring the police officers and tearing their clothes and hats, causing the Hukuai to be afraid to board the ships and peck rice. Nine people who committed the violence have been arrested. This matter harms the interests of the industry. Please quickly devise a solution. After discussion among the merchants, Gu Xinyi, Cai Yukun, Chen Ziyi, Yan Xiaoquan, Zhu Zixiang, and Fu Qiangeng were nominated to go to the Municipal Party Department, Social Affairs Bureau, and Public Security Bureau to present the situation of the boat owners' harassment and request a stop to it. At the same time, a document was submitted to the Ministry of Industry and the Municipal Government for review and handling.</p>
<p>Post-Incident Prevention: After receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau, fearing that the dispute would escalate, dispatched additional police teams to the soy and rice market pier to station there. At the same time, they also advised the Hukuai in various rice shops to work as usual. Therefore, at about 1:00 PM, the Hukuai in various rice shops resumed work as usual. In the evening, the police teams were withdrawn, and four armed police officers were dispatched by the First Precinct Police Station to guard the area for prevention.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories in Hongkou District to Resume Work This Morning on a Trial Basis</h3>
<p>If Workers Do Not Return to Work, They Prepare to Close Down</p>
<p>Government Sent Personnel Yesterday to Advise the Union</p>
<p>The labor dispute in the city's silk factories is worsening after the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation broke down. The factories in the Hongkou district are scheduled to sound the whistle this morning to resume work, but it is still uncertain whether the striking female workers will return to work.</p>
<p>Yuyuan and Other Resumption of Work: After the female workers of Yuyuan Silk Factory on Guoging Road and Chuxin Silk Factory on Manchuria Road went on strike again, the factory accepted the advice of the Silk Factory Industry Association and sounded the whistle at 5:30 AM yesterday morning, announcing the resumption of work. At the same time, they were protected by the Fourth District Water Police of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. At that time, although the female workers' conditions had not yet been specifically addressed, they entered the factory and resumed work for the sake of their livelihood. By about 6:00 AM, the female workers of the two factories had completely entered the factory and resumed work. The workers in the Zhabei district and the concession area also worked as usual, and fortunately, no incidents occurred.</p>
<p>Hongkou District to Resume Work Today: In the Hongkou district, the Xiangcheng and other silk factories, excluding Yichang, which has been closed, total eleven. Since the strike on the 23rd of last month, it has been more than ten days. After repeated mediation by the government, no solution has been found. According to the resolution of the Second Member Congress of the Silk Factory Industry Association, it was decided to uniformly sound the whistle at 5:30 AM this morning to announce the resumption of work. At the same time, the Fifth District, Fourth Sub-bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was requested to send additional police officers for protection. The factory supervisors informed the female workers in advance that if the workers did not return to work after the resumption of work, they would prepare to close down and move elsewhere to do business. However, it is still uncertain whether the female workers will return to work.</p>
<p>Government Sent Personnel to Advise: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has repeatedly conducted mediation with the Municipal Party Department regarding the silk factory industry's strike dispute. However, because the employer representatives refused the conditions put forward by the union and insisted on the labor-management contract method of July 8, mediation could not proceed. In addition to submitting the handling process to the director for instructions, in order to avoid the expansion of the strike, the Bureau specially sent staff yesterday to advise the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union, etc.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Officially Discloses the Shanghai Workers' Cost of Living Index</h3>
<p>The book "Shanghai Workers' Cost of Living Index" compiled by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau took three years from planning to completion. More than 40 people conducted on-site surveys. It was originally scheduled to be published on January 30 this year, but the manuscripts were destroyed in the Commercial Press fire. After reprinting and correcting, it was finally completed. At the same time, the materials for the 20th year were added, and it was published by Zhonghua Book Company. The book is based on a household livelihood survey of 305 worker families, weighted by consumption, and includes retail prices of 60 items, divided into five categories, from January 15th to December 20th. Issues related to the investigation and compilation, such as weighted averages, price surveys, calculation formulas, and price base periods, are discussed in detail. The trends of classified and total indices over the years are analyzed in order, and the reasons for the rise and fall are explained in detail. In addition to the indices and prices over the years, important domestic cost of living indices and retail prices are also attached for reference. The system of weights and measures has been changed to the newly promulgated and municipal system. Mr. Cai Yuanpei of the Academia Sinica said, "It will undoubtedly benefit the study of Shanghai labor affairs and the Chinese labor movement." Mr. An Lide, Commercial Counselor of the United States, said, "It will be of great contribution to those who want to clearly understand the actual situation of China's industrialization." Professor Fang Xianting of Nankai University said, "The cost of living index compiled by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is the most extensive in scope." He also said, "It is enough to prove that Chinese people are gradually paying attention to the use of indices." "It can also make the complicated and unstable situation in the current economic order more clear."</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Drafts Measures for Fire Insurance Compensation in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Approves Claims Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Claims Committee previously requested the municipal government to quickly find a way to provide substantial assistance and submitted a report to the municipal government. Yesterday, the municipal government specifically</p>
<p>issued a directive stating: The submission has been noted. This case was previously reported to the government by the Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Association, requesting assistance. The Social Affairs Bureau was ordered to review the case and submit three proposed handling methods: (1) From a rational and emotional point of view, this compensation cannot be fully paid according to the amount, nor can it be completely unpaid. The Fire Insurance Compensation Research Association should be responsible for quickly clarifying and studying the disaster situation of the insured households in various places to determine whether or not to pay compensation; (2) After any insured household is determined to have no compensation, the insurance company should refund the premium that has been paid; (3) Adopt the proposal of the Lawyers Association and Accountants Association to issue public bonds as a means of relief. The reason for increasing the premium and using the public bond fund for the insured is still taken from the insured, and the insurance industry is not fundamentally affected. However, foreign merchants operating should also be required to bear corresponding obligations. The three proposed points were deemed to be fair, and the bureau was ordered to convene representatives of Chinese and foreign insurance associations in this city and all relevant parties to properly formulate specific measures and submit them for approval. The aforementioned situation is now in accordance with the previous order, except that the Social Affairs Bureau is ordered to comply with the previous order and quickly handle the case and report it.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Plans to Establish a Yangjing Model Health District</h3>
<p>The Wusong Model Health District Is Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>The city originally had two model health districts, Wusong and Gaoqiao. The Wusong Model District was jointly operated by the Municipal Health Bureau and the Medical College of the Central University. The Gaoqiao Model District was solely managed by the Municipal Health Bureau. The funding was previously subsidized by the American oil tycoon Rockefeller. Recently, the American oil tycoon stopped the subsidies, and the Wusong Model</p>
<p>District was almost completely destroyed by the Shanghai War and could not be restored. The Municipal Health Bureau changed its policy, temporarily suspending the Wusong Model District, while the Gaoqiao Model District was jointly operated with the Medical College of the Central University. A new model district is being planned and built in Yangjing. It is reported that the plan has been approved by the Municipal Government. In terms of funding, the planned construction cost is 13,000 yuan, the equipment cost is 3,500 yuan (including soil filling, ditching, pipe lighting, wires, and other sanitary equipment), and the start-up cost is 2,500 yuan (including instruments, medical equipment, medicines, printed materials, stationery, miscellaneous expenses, etc.), totaling 19,000 yuan. In addition to the 6,000 yuan raised by Pan Weibing, the former Yangjing District Municipal Committee member, the rest will be allocated by the Municipal Government and has been completely resolved. Therefore, the Bureau is actively proceeding with the construction of the new model district and will be able to open it around March next year.</p>
<h3>Hu Xiyuan's Letter to the National Private Electric Power Association</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the National Private Electric Power Association has been well-organized, well-managed, and has achieved remarkable results. However, the association has foreign merchant members, and the association's charter and application form are all in English, which causes outsiders to misunderstand the truth. Now, Hu Xituyuan of the Electric Power Industry has written a letter to the association as follows: Dear Sirs (omitted above), I recently heard of your association's charter and the solicitation of membership, combining the power of the country to seek the development of the electric power industry. The purpose is just and great, and I admire it very much. Although I am not talented, I have been in the electric power industry for a long time. I would like to discuss with my colleagues what I have seen and heard: (1) The name and reality should be consistent. Since your association is named the National Private Electric Power Association, then in terms of territory, it is naturally limited to the territory under the jurisdiction of the Republic of China. In terms of people, it should also be the industry operated by the people of the Republic of China. Now, Article 3 of the charter stipulates that the qualifications of members include a supporting member item, and</p>
<p>foreign electrical appliance companies can also be included, and stipulate the membership fee that should be paid each month. I think it is not possible. For the sake of exchanging knowledge and promoting culture, the development of the European and American electric power industries is more than several times greater than that of our country. How can they condescend to the scope and be willing to be a member and bear the annual expenses? How can we ask the guides who import culture to join the association and collect their membership fees? Even if there are foreign merchants who are willing to come and are happy to transport, their intentions are different. This is the first point that should be discussed in fact. If it is said that this association is not enough to be called a union without borrowing from other mountains, then it is already named the National Private</p>
<p>Electric Power Association, and the national private electric power industry is naturally the main body. Why add supporting members among the members? Why add foreign companies in addition to domestic companies? This is even more suspicious and should be discussed in two (2) The charter and application form should be changed to Chinese. The text is the expression of a country's culture. All independent countries respect their national text. Our country has suffered from the invasion of great powers for a long time, either by military force, or by economy, or by culture, and their invasion purposes are all the same. In recent years, the Chinese people have become quite aware, so the foreign language documents used in the future are gradually changed to Chinese, and the intention is very good. Your association is a large group with a nationally recognized organization, and the charter and application form sent are all in English. Outsiders are unpredictable, thinking that this is a group of international organizations. But who knows that it is a union of our national private electric power industry. Although the matter is trivial, it is very important to the public opinion, and this should be discussed even more. The above two points are said from the beginning. I am not talented, and I venture to present my words, and I hope to be taught (omitted below).</p>
<h3>Fire Insurance Policyholders in Disaster Areas Temporarily Suspend Claims</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Association Claims Committee has gathered fire insurance policyholders for several days to negotiate and dispute claims with various insurance companies. The Social Affairs Bureau has come out to advise them, and the Executive Committee held a discussion at 11:00 AM yesterday to suspend claims. The association will specifically publish a notice in the newspaper today to inform all policyholders, stating the attitude of the authorities and announcing the temporary suspension of claims. Yu Qiaqing and other executive committee members of the association specifically submitted a report to the Municipal Government yesterday, requesting it to find a way to provide relief so that the disputes can be resolved as soon as possible. However, the attitude of Sincere is still steady, saying that it should be resolved in accordance with proper procedures. The Social Affairs Bureau will convene representatives of the insurance industry association and representatives of the compensation association to jointly conduct mediation.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Kaiping Boy Scout Touring Group Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Departs for Beijing by Night Train on the 8th</p>
<p>The Kaiping County Boy Scout Trainer Training Institute in Guangdong Province traveled to Jiangsu and Zhejiang to increase the wisdom of the Boy Scouts, enrich their experience, and conduct on-site inspections of Boy Scout education in order to develop the Boy Scout cause in Guangdong. It was found that the institute had a total of 81 touring members, led by Director Zhu Lieguang, trainers Zhang Changmin, Ye Weidong, Ma Wenfu, and Tan Jianbo, Boy Scout instructor of the Guangdong Provincial Party Department. They took a train from Guangzhou on September 30 and arrived in Shanghai on the 7th. The Guangzhao Public School and the Boy Scout Council had already received the institute's telegram about arriving in Shanghai, so on that day, the entire staff and students of the Guangzhao Public School and Gan, the representative of the Boy Scout Council, rushed to the pier to welcome them and invited them to stay in Moore Hall. At the same time, they also informed the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, and the Education Bureau to provide guidance. They originally planned to visit various schools and war relics in the city. Later, after learning that Nanjing would hold the Ning City Boy Scout Jamboree on the 8th, 9th, and 13th, they immediately changed the schedule to take a night train to Beijing on the 8th to participate in the Ning City Boy Scout Jamboree. After about a few days, they would return to Shanghai, inspect it for a few days, and then go to Hangzhou.</p>

<h3>The Case of the Robbery and Assassination of Wu Guangzhong at the Changxing Coal Mine</h3>
<p>Zhou Mingshan Also Implicated</p>
<p>Identified by Maid Qiuhong</p>
<p>All Suspects Temporarily Not Transferred</p>
<p>A Seven-Day Extension for Investigation</p>
<p>Li Yangyuan, the Detective Chief of the Second Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Security Team, investigated that the Changxing Coal Mine Bureau in Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, was raided by a large gang of bandits armed with weapons in November of last year. The bandits robbed over five thousand yuan, opened fire to resist arrest, killed Police Chief Lu, and seized over ten firearms. It was discovered that some of the bandits had fled to Shanghai, so he led detectives Yao Bailin, Zhou Mingshan, etc., to Shanghai. They requested the Old Zha police station to send more Chinese and foreign detectives to Room 89 of the Juelu Hotel on Xizang Road and Room 28 of the Xindahua Hotel on Fuzhou Road. They arrested four suspects: Song Jiande, Wu Jigui, Zhang Shaoliang, and Yao Jieshen. Two box-type pistols and fifty-nine rounds of ammunition were found in Room 28. After examination, it was found that the firearms were all stamped with the seal of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. They were handed over to the First Special District Court, which ordered them to be detained for investigation and interrogation. This matter has been reported in this newspaper.</p>
<p>Assassination of Wu Guangzong The police station has now found that Wu Guangzong, the director of the Hydrographic Survey Bureau, was assassinated on the 21st of last month at 8 a.m. While he was sleeping in his residence at No. 16 Ningli, Fangxie Road in the city, several thugs broke into his house, forced their way upstairs, and shot him, causing his death. It has been confirmed that Song Jiande, Zhang Shaoliang, and Zhou Mingshan (also known as Zhou Asi), a detective of the Second Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Team, colluded to commit the murder.</p>
<p>Robbery on Wuzhou Road At 6 p.m. on the 24th of last month, the home of Chen Rongsheng, a resident of No. 1040 Wuzhou Road, was raided by four armed robbers who stole valuables worth 140 yuan. It has also been confirmed that Zhou Mingshan, along with Song and Zhang, and other accomplices who are still at large, committed the robbery. The firearms stamped with the seal of the Municipal Police Bureau were lost by the Zhabei Fourth District Police Department during the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, the Chinese and foreign detectives detained Zhou Mingshan.</p>
<p>Identifying the Real Culprits Wu Guangzong's wife, Zhong Huizhen, his family maid, Qiuhong, and Chen Rongsheng's son, Chen Akang, were summoned to the police station separately. Zhou Mingshan was made to change his clothes and mixed among the group of suspects for each person to identify. Qiuhong immediately identified Zhou as one of the murderers. Yesterday morning, Zhou, along with Song, Wu, Zhang, and Yao, were all sent to the First Special District Court. Judge Feng Shide conducted the interrogation, and Chief Prosecutor Wang also attended the court to perform his duties.</p>
<p>All Temporarily Not Transferred After arriving in court, the representative of the Municipal Police Bureau and the Zhejiang Provincial Detective Chief Li Yangyuan each stated their reasons, competing to request the transfer of the suspects. However, Detective Li still defended his colleague Zhou Mingshan. The police station lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated the findings of the investigation, arguing that since the defendants had committed robbery within the concession, the transfer should be delayed until the robbery case was thoroughly investigated and concluded before further action was taken.</p>
<p>Witness Testimony Next, Chen Akang testified that three robbers came that day, all carrying handguns. He only recognized Song Jiande and Zhang Shaoliang. Chen Rongsheng's wife testified that Yao Jieshen had previously rented a room upstairs in her house, and Song, Wu, and Zhang all came to visit Yao every day. However, she was out when the robbery occurred, so she did not witness it. Wu's maid, Qiuhong, testified that four people came that morning. They first talked to the homeowner's bodyguard, Lao Xu, for half an hour, so she clearly recognized the faces of all four people. Besides Zhou Mingshan, the others were Song, Wu, and Zhang.</p>
<p>Defendant Testimony When questioned, Song Jiande and Zhang Shaoliang both stated that Zhou Mingshan had given them the handguns, and they returned them to Zhou after the robbery, who then distributed the stolen money, three yuan and five yuan respectively. Yao Jieshen claimed that Zhou Mingshan provided the money to rent the room at the Xindahua Hotel, and he claimed he did not know who hid the firearms in the room. Zhou Mingshan completely denied the robbery and the murder of Director Wu, claiming that he came to Shanghai to arrest bandits and was being falsely accused by them. He requested a detailed investigation. The judge then ordered the defendants to be returned to custody and extended the period for seven days to investigate and continue the interrogation.</p>
<h3>One Bandit in Lu Shaotang Kidnapping Case Sent Back for Retrial</h3>
<p>Kidnapping Crime Already Received Clemency</p>
<p>Gun Murder of Bodyguard Requires Further Investigation</p>
<p>Lu Shaotang, a compradore at the Fairchild &amp; Co., was kidnapped at dusk on December 18th two years ago when his car passed the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road by Fei Shuaisong and others. The Russian bodyguard hired by Lu, Mao Taisituluo, who was sitting in the car, was shot and killed by the bandits. Afterward, the police rescued Lu and successively captured many of the bandits, all of whom were convicted by the First Special District Court. Those sentenced to death, except for Li Changyuan from Tianjin, are still imprisoned awaiting execution. The others, such as Fei Shuaisong, have already been executed. Li's death sentence had also been approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, but at that time the National Government was issuing a general amnesty, so Li's execution was temporarily suspended. After re-examination by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, a doubt was discovered. According to the amnesty regulations, kidnapping offenders could receive clemency, but those who committed premeditated murder were not included in the amnesty. Li Changyuan's kidnapping of Lu Shaotang with his accomplices was confirmed, but whether Li was also involved in the shooting of Lu's bodyguard required further investigation. Therefore, the Second Branch of the High Court ordered Shen Jiayi, the president of the court, to instruct Zhou Xianjue, the president of the First Special District Court, to re-examine the murder portion of the case to ensure caution. After the Special Court notified the police station, yesterday morning, detectives were dispatched to the Western Prison to bring Li Changyuan to court, and the accomplice Hu Mingde and witnesses were also summoned separately. Judge Feng interrogated them. Li Changyuan mistakenly believed that the reason for the retrial was to absolve him of his guilt, so he denied all the circumstances of the kidnapping that were interrogated in court, and even denied what he had previously confessed. Hu Mingde and Lu Shaotang's two drivers could not definitively prove whether Li Changyuan was present when the shooting occurred. However, police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that, according to the confessions of other accomplices in the case, Li delivered the handgun to the hotel, and Li and his accomplices were in the same car when the shooting occurred, so Li was not only present at the scene, but had conspired beforehand and should not be entitled to the amnesty. The court also appointed a lawyer to defend Li, and after being instructed by Chief Prosecutor Wang, Judge Feng scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 15th of this month, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Killing on Yu Tong Road: One Bandit Captured, One Killed</h3>
<p>Police Bravery in Apprehending Robbers Commendable</p>
<p>At 9:55 p.m. the night before last, when Wu Jinshan's Wu Yilong noodle shop at No. 89 Yu Tong Road, Zhabei, was about to close, four robbers suddenly appeared. Two were wearing black cloth short shirts and trousers, and two were wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers. They were bald and spoke with a Jiangbei accent. They carried three handguns, and one unarmed robber stood guard at the door. One robber walked into the shop, and two robbers went upstairs, driving Wu's family to the roof, prohibiting them from making any noise. Under Wu's bed, they searched and stole 140 yuan in banknotes. Then they went downstairs and searched the shop assistant, Zhong Chengcai, taking three yuan in silver, four yuan in banknotes, and ten jiao in small silver coins. Wu's relative, Cang Fa, happened to be visiting and staying overnight in the shop, so he was also robbed of 15.40 yuan. When the three robbers saw that they had achieved their goal, they immediately ran out. Before leaving, they turned back and took a felt hat from the counter. Wu Jinshan immediately chased after them, shouting for help. Police officers at posts No. 15 and No. 3 nearby heard the alarm and urgently reported to the Second Sub-bureau of the Fourth District. Section Chief Hou Zhai immediately dispatched Inspector Lin to lead a large number of police officers to surround and capture the robbers in three directions: Yu Tong Road, Guangfu Road, and Guangzhao Road. Seeing that they were being closely pursued, the robbers split up and fled west. In a moment of desperation, one robber fled into a thatched house on Chang'an Road. Seeing that police officer Shao Xueyi was closely pursuing him, he turned back and opened fire to resist arrest. Shao returned fire, and both sides exchanged four or five shots. The robber was shot and killed by Shao. At the same time, Inspector Lin also captured a robber near Guangfu Road. The other two robbers escaped due to the darkness. The captured robber was taken to the Second Sub-bureau, where, after interrogation, he confessed his name as Liu Jinbiao, 25 years old, from Funing. The dead robber was named Zhang Ziyu, who had previously visited friends unsuccessfully and earned a living by pulling a rickshaw. On the first day of this month, he met Cao Xiaosizi, who was on the run, at Xinqiao in the Sampan Factory. Cao gave him two small silver coins because he saw that he was poor, and asked him to go to his thatched house on the night before last (the 7th) to discuss matters. He kept his promise and went. Cao Xiaosizi told him to stand guard at the door of the Wu Yilong noodle shop. After Cao Xiaosizi finished robbing the shop, he gave him 24 yuan in silver and a felt hat. After verifying his confession, the sub-bureau found 24 yuan in silver and a felt hat on his person. Section Chief Hou then strictly ordered all police officers to pursue the two robbers who were still at large and bring them to justice. The body of the dead robber was reported to the court for inspection by the local bailiff. The sub-bureau has prepared a document to report Liu Jinbiao to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Centenarian Mother Celebrates Her Birthday Today</h3>
<p>There is a rural woman named Gu Yao on the Caojiaqiao in west Shanghai, between Jiaozhou Road and Yuyuan Road. She is already one hundred years old, and today is her birthday. Her children and grandchildren are holding a celebration for her. Gu Yao's family is quite wealthy and owns a lot of farmland. Her husband passed away 25 years ago, and he was the same age as her. He was 75 years old when he passed away. Gu Yao's family used to be engaged in farming. After the opening of Shanghai as a concession, the land in western Shanghai became valuable, so Gu Yao became even wealthier. However, she is still able to manage her household frugally and work hard as before. She has three sons and two daughters, three grandsons and five granddaughters, three great-grandsons, and four great-granddaughters. She also has many nephews, nieces and great-nieces. However, her eldest son has already passed away. When her husband passed away, Gu Yao divided her family property into three shares. The eldest son's family still lives in the old house in Caojiaqiao, while the second and youngest sons have built new residences on Yuyuan Road. Today's celebration is being held in the new house of her youngest son, Gu Jiatang, on Yuyuan Road. However, Gu Yao does not like living in Western-style houses and still lives in her old house in Caojiaqiao. Gu Yao is very frugal in her life, and her diet and clothing are regular, so she is still quite healthy. She says that she has never had any illnesses in her life, and even a slight headache is considered a major illness. She is now a hundred years old, but her movements are no different from those of a woman in her fifties. Her teeth have fallen out, her eyes are slightly blurred, and her ears are slightly deaf, which is similar to ordinary old women. She gets up at 7 a.m. every day and rests at 8 p.m. She eats one bowl of rice for each of her three meals a day and can still work as before. Three years ago, she could wash her own clothes without help, but now she still sews her own clothes if they are slightly torn. Gu Yao often admonishes her children to manage their households without extravagance. She has visited places such as the Sincere Company and traveled by car, but later said that cars are not as comfortable as rented cars, and rented cars are not as smooth as sedan chairs. She can talk about historical events vividly and is concerned about the recent changes. In modern times, people indulge in licentiousness, and it is rare to live to be a hundred years old, so today's banquet will definitely be a grand occasion.</p>

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Zikawei Observatory's weather forecast for 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the sky along the Chinese coast would be overcast, with strong northwesterly to northeasterly seasonal winds. Between the Ogasawara Islands, Kyushu, and the southeast coast of Japan, the weather is deteriorating due to the northward movement of a hurricane, with violent cyclones. The center of the hurricane was located at noon today within 120 miles of the intersection of 26 degrees north latitude and 138 degrees east longitude, moving northward with unknown wind force. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in this city reached a maximum of 77.9 and a minimum of 53.6. On the same day last year, the maximum was 79.2 and the minimum was 66.9.</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>Regarding your newspaper's report (October 8th), on page 14 of section four, entitled "Collision Between Yunlong and Yongyuan Steamers Causes Damage," the following is a statement to clarify the facts, which do not entirely align with the report. Our company's Yunlong steamer was, in fact, struck by the Yongyuan steamer because the other vessel was unfamiliar with the Yangtze River navigation rules and went off course. Had our ship not taken emergency measures, the danger would have been considerable. The blame rests entirely with the Yongyuan. After the incident, we sent a letter of inquiry and requested compensation, but the company refused to accept the letter, only noting on the letter that the responsibility was still to be determined by an impartial party. Later, the other party asked a friend to intercede several times, so negotiations have not yet proceeded. The report in your newspaper today, based solely on the one-sided account of the other party, without any on-site investigation, is, in our opinion, regrettable. We hope that you will promptly issue a correction to set the record straight. Sincerely, Heng'an Chengji Steamboat Co., Ltd., October 8th.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shenbao, Greetings. Having read your newspaper's report regarding the collision between our Yongyuan and Yunlong vessels, we find that the information presented is slightly inaccurate, likely due to a misunderstanding by your reporter. We hereby submit this letter to clarify the matter and request a correction. Yours respectfully, Yongyuan Steamboat Co., October 8th, Telegram Address: 5207.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shenbao, Greetings. Your newspaper's local news column on September 27th published a report regarding the death of a patrolman who was shot. The report stated that the wife of the deceased, Jiang Shang, claimed that her husband, Jiang Guohua, had previously served as a militiaman in Pudong. This is completely untrue. Our militia has never employed anyone named Jiang Guohua, and our management committee has records to verify this. The false claim by Jiang Shang is likely intended to mislead and harm our reputation. We are submitting this information to be published in the Letters to the Editor column to set the record straight. Respectfully, The Joint Militia of Yangsi District, Gaoqiao District, Yangjing District, Gaohang District, Luhang District, and Tangqiao District, Shanghai.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shenbao, Greetings. I was astonished to read your newspaper's report on the 7th regarding the increased tax on liquor licenses by various liquor industry groups. As the director of general affairs, I did not identify myself as a section chief to representatives of the tobacco and liquor industry regarding the license tax. At the time, I stated that we would follow the regulations of the Ministry, and those who were concealing their income would be dealt with according to the regulations. However, those who were in compliance would naturally continue to pay according to the old rates. The claim that I insisted on raising the license fee from two yuan to four yuan is a complete misunderstanding. There were more than ten of them, and I showed them the license documents, which they all reviewed. How could there be such unfounded claims? As for the autumn tax amount, there may have been some concealment in the past due to disagreements between the Ministry and the provincial government. If we do not investigate the business situation and make thorough adjustments, how can we maintain national revenue and prevent fraud? Therefore, we cannot cite this as a precedent, which is also a difficult position. The claims of threats and harsh levies are likely intended to damage our bureau's reputation and are based on hearsay. I am submitting this letter for clarification and hope that it will be published in the Letters to the Editor column to set the record straight. Respectfully, Sun Shaoqing, Chief of General Affairs, Shanghai Tobacco and Liquor License Tax Collection Sub-Bureau, October 8th.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shenbao, Greetings. Having read your newspaper's report "Huang Chengxie, a Prisoner in the First Special Court," the article states that "Lawyer Jiang Chiping received a phone call at his residence from Liang Bingchao, a translator at the Special Court (Liang and Jiang are close friends), stating that someone had asked him to appear in court to defend him." There is no translator named Liang Bingchao in our court. We are submitting this letter for clarification and hope that it will be corrected. Respectfully, The Translator's Office of the Shanghai First Special District Court, October 8th.</p>

<p>Aphorisms of Ma Xiangbo, a Nonagenarian</p>
<h3>Poetry, Prose, and Wine</h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>Here are some miscellaneous notes on poetry, prose, and wine.</p>
<p>(A) Poetry</p>
<p>Old Man Xiangbo said: Chinese poetry is passable when describing scenery, but inferior to the works of famous Greek and Latin authors when discussing principles. Han Changli's poems describing fire scenes are quite interesting, as he uses many words denoting "red light"! Jiang Shiquan's courage is truly admirable. In one of his poems on morning purchases, he openly writes about "the birth of the Lord" so many years ago, i.e., the Kangxi year. Because now we only use the so-called "Gregorian calendar"!</p>
<p>(B) Prose</p>
<p>Old Man Xiangbo said: Chinese literati should cultivate their attitudes more. Because they love to be praised, and if someone says something bad about them, they immediately abandon the self-deprecating attitude they showed when they were being praised! They even engage in literary disputes over disagreements, as can be seen in Zeng Wenzheng's collection of writings. After all, everyone has different views, so why argue back and forth? For example, today I look at flowers and say red is good, but tomorrow I look again and say green is good. Even one's own views change from morning to night! Do all the self-proclaimed literary giants have to bow down to me alone? I think such an attitude is unnecessary!</p>
<p>(C) Wine</p>
<p>Old Man Xiangbo often advised us to drink a little wine at meals, saying that it can help with poetic inspiration. Because the vague intoxication of wine is precisely what literature calls imaginative emotion, and he cited many stories of literary giants and poets as proof. Of course, he did not encourage excessive drinking!</p>
<h3>Candied Hawthorns</h3>
<p>— Tie An</p>
<p>Sights and Sounds of the Old Capital</p>
<p>The Northern Capital inherits Mongolian traditions and greatly enjoys dairy foods. The saying that Southerners who come to the North are not fond of dairy products has been around for a long time. Today, there are milk tea shops on the streets that specialize in selling these foods. The milk cakes they make have a sour and smelly taste, which Northerners consider a delicacy, but Southerners often wrinkle their noses at. This difference in food preferences between North and South has persisted for thousands of years and has not been reconciled. The Ming dynasty followed Yuan customs, and many of its foods were taken from beyond its borders. Chen Yuan's "Sights and Sounds of the Imperial City" states that during the Ming dynasty, the court gave officials a box of seven kinds of sweets for the Winter Solstice: one was pine nut hailixuan. Zheng Yiwei said that the character xuan is not found in various dictionaries, and he also does not know what hailixuan is, probably a Yuan term. Another anecdote in "Jie'an Rambling Notes" states that on the eighth day of the fourth month of the Ming dynasty, the court gave officials Buluojia to eat outside the Wu Gate. Buluojia is also a Yuan term, which some say is zongzi (rice dumplings) or the current term bobo, which seems closer. Bobo is a general term for wheat foods. As for Manchu foods that are still popular today, sachima is one. It is made with rock sugar, cream, and white flour, shaped like glutinous rice, baked in a lime wood oven, and then cut into squares, which are sweet and greasy to eat. Furong cake is similar to sachima, but with brown sugar on the surface, resembling furong (hibiscus). Both of these do not have the taste of milk or cheese and can be appreciated even by Southerners. However, I think the most inexpensive and delicious is candied hawthorns. They are made by skewering grapes, yams, haitang fruit, haws, walnuts, etc., on bamboo sticks and dipping them in rock sugar, which is sweet, crunchy, and cool. Eating them on winter nights can refresh the palate. In the North, winter is not warm without a blazing stove, so it is good to eat cool foods to moisten the heart and lungs. In the Northeast, people often eat watermelon, but in the capital, they often substitute fresh grapes, which are white, juicy, and cool, and even the poor can enjoy their taste.</p>
<p>Two Seasonal Foods</p>
<h3>Osmanthus Chestnuts</h3>
<p>— Hong Liu</p>
<p>Osmanthus chestnuts are produced in Changshu and Lushan. When eaten, they have the aroma of osmanthus, hence the name. One theory is that the original variety is now extinct, and those sold on the market today are all ding, so the aroma is far less pronounced. As for why the original variety became extinct, according to old tales, there was a gentleman who retired to his home. He sighed over the osmanthus chestnuts, considering them a rarity of the world. Moreover, their production was very small, and he feared that they would be presented to the imperial garden, leading to annual tributes and corvée labor, which the people could not bear. Therefore, he bought all the trees and cut them down to prevent future troubles. The original variety was thus lost. I saw a poem by Mr. Zong Ziwei a few years ago that also commemorated this event, which may be true. It is a pity that the famous variety has not been passed down!</p>
<h3>Red Mushrooms and Mist Dance</h3>
<p>Are delicacies of autumn, with an extremely delicious taste, but many are poisonous. In general, those with delicate colors that change color in sunlight or turn silver black are inedible. Gifting them to superiors for consumption has been the practice since the Song dynasty. Fang Weng's poem says, "Sealed small gift box of red mushrooms." Red mushrooms are also known as mushrooms. Mushrooms that are red in color are often poisonous, so did the Song people eat poisonous mushrooms without harm?</p>
<h3>Family Dietary Hygiene Methods</h3>
<p>— Cao Ji Kuai</p>
<p>Beware of Disease Entering Through the Mouth</p>
<p>As the saying goes, a hundred diseases enter through the mouth. Although this statement does not entirely conform to medical theory, many digestive disorders are actually induced by food. Here are some of the simplest family dietary hygiene methods to offer to the people. If they can be implemented, they may prevent diseases from taking shape. (1) Boil utensils. Tableware such as chopsticks, spoons, bowls, and plates should be washed clean and boiled in a pot for ten minutes before eating to kill any attached fungi.</p>
<p>(2) Cook food thoroughly. No matter what kind of food it is, it must be fully boiled to ensure that it is thoroughly cooked before eating. Otherwise, it is easy to cause problems, especially with meat. (Because it often contains parasites.) Therefore, all fried meat and raw fish, shrimp, and crabs should not be eaten.</p>
<p>(3) Cleanliness of the cook. Anyone who cooks food, whether male or female, should strictly adhere to cleanliness, such as washing clothes and aprons frequently, cutting fingernails regularly, and washing away dirt from the hands, to prevent bacteria from harboring there.</p>
<p>(4) Discard leftover food. All food should be cooked and eaten immediately. If there are leftovers, they must be thoroughly boiled before eating. If the leftover food has a bad smell, it is a sign of bacteria and should not be eaten even if it is boiled. Boiling can kill bacteria, but the toxins of dead bacteria may still be present and harmful. Therefore, Confucius said not to eat food with a bad color or smell, which also means discarding leftover food.</p>
<p>(5) Drive away flies. Flies are excellent vectors for spreading bacteria, and food is a good culture medium for bacteria. Therefore, if flies come into contact with food, it is inevitable that it will be contaminated. Because prevention is difficult, the best way is to find ways to drive them away.</p>
<h3>Tofu Snack Recipe</h3>
<p>— Jing Ru</p>
<p>Good Taste</p>
<p>Tofu is a common food in our country, and Westerners consider it to be one of the most nutritious. Everyone knows how to make it, so there is no need to repeat it. The following details only the methods of cooking.</p>
<p>(1) Tofu Pudding comes in sweet and savory varieties, and the method is very simple. The sweet one is made by adding sugar to tofu whey. It is best eaten in the morning. The savory one is made by removing the whey and adding soy sauce, and then adding a little sesame oil. It is very good for eating with rice. Or you can add a little mustard powder. (Southerners hate mustard like an enemy, probably because they hate its bad breath. But they don't know that eating a little is very good for hygiene, and it has the effect of preventing epidemics and dispelling phlegm. After eating, rinse your mouth with clean water, and then hold a pinch of tea leaves in your mouth, and the smell will disappear.)</p>
<p>(2) Scrambled Tofu First stir-fry shredded meat in a pot, add appropriate seasonings, and then stir-fry with tofu.</p>
<p>(3) Chicken Lung Tofu First chop the chicken lung, mix it evenly with egg white, then stir-fry it in a pot with sesame oil, add appropriate seasonings, and then stir-fry with chopped tofu. The taste is quite sweet and fragrant.</p>
<p>(4) Stewed Tofu First boil clear soup in a pot, add seasonings, and then add tofu, abalone slices, and matsutake mushrooms to the pot to cook together. The taste is extremely delicious. It is also good to stew it with chicken offal.</p>
<p>(5) Fried Tofu Squeeze out the water from the tofu, add oil to a pot and fry it. Use it in place of meat to make various vegetarian dishes, all of which are excellent. I once saw something called stinky tofu in Shanghai, which had a strange and unpleasant smell, but many people liked it. I found that the way it was made was very unhygienic. And the authorities did not ban it, even allowing it to be sold on the streets, which I do not understand. (End note)</p>
<h3>Pine Flowers of Qiyun Mountain</h3>
<p>— He Lianlu</p>
<p>Qiyun Mountain is located fifteen miles southwest of Qixian County, two hundred li east of Gansu Province. The mountain is lined with Southern temples and lush with pines and cypresses. Deer and leopards can be found, and it also produces good musk. It can be called one of the famous mountains in Longshang. Every early autumn, a plant grows that is about three inches tall, yellow in color, and shaped like coral. The locals call it pine flower. It is sold in Yuyi and is considered a top-quality fresh vegetable with an exceptionally delicious taste. I have asked general travelers, and they all say that it is rare in China and abroad. However, after it is separated from the soil, it should be cooked immediately. If it is left for two or three days, its taste will be lacking, and it will easily become infested with insects. It is a pity that it is produced in a remote area in the northwest, and few people know about it. If it could be brought to the sea, then we could try this northwestern delicacy.</p>
<h3>Sampan Congee at Lychee Bay</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yi</p>
<p>Guangdong Flavors</p>
<p>Recently, a type of so-called "Sampan Congee" has become popular in Shanghai's Guangdong food restaurants. To Shanghainese, this name may seem novel and inexplicable; even Guangdong people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time and have not returned to their hometowns may not fully understand it. I must first do a little explanatory work here: "Sampan" means small boat, equivalent to what Shanghainese call "sanban" and Hangzhou people call "hua zi." "Congee" is just congee, no need to explain. But why is congee prefixed with the name "sampan"? It turns out that this type of congee is similar to "Fish Congee" and "Zhuangyuan Congee," but the ingredients are added or subtracted differently, and the creators were a group of boat people in Guangzhou who cooked and sold it on their boats. Its taste is indeed more delicious than ordinary fish congee, hence the name. Examining the preparation of fish congee, the ingredients include fish slices, meat patties, pig liver, pig intestines (small intestines), eggs, "zheng cai" (a type of dried salted vegetable sold in Guangdong stores), fried dough sticks, coriander (Shanghainese call it cilantro), scallions, soy sauce, cooked peanut oil, and pepper. Sampan congee, however, omits the meaningless pig liver and pig intestines, replacing them with crunchy peanuts, shredded jellyfish, and shrimp roe. First, a "ren zi huo" (a large, nearly cylindrical earthenware pot) is used to cook the chicken and congee together, supposedly using two or three chickens per pot. When eating, the remaining ingredients are arranged in the bowl, and then the congee is poured over them. Coriander, scallions, pepper, shrimp roe, peanuts, and other ingredients are added after the congee. Sampan congee has less liquid than fish congee, and the chewable parts account for six or seven tenths of it. Peanuts, jellyfish, and shrimp roe are its defining features. The Lychee Bay area is the most famous for selling sampan congee.</p>
<p>The name Lychee Bay is fascinating, but in reality, it is far inferior to West Lake; Shanghai's "Wa Li Da" is somewhat similar. However, Lychee Bay has many large trees, the water is more turbid, there are many dilapidated buildings on both sides, the boats on the water are quite crowded, and there is a time of day when many pleasure boats come and go.</p>
<p>Guangzhou's upper class enjoys leisure, but there are not many places for water recreation in Guangzhou, so Lychee Bay has been favored and gained fame. In recent years, a small golf course has been built on the nearby shore, and sampan congee has become very popular.</p>
<p>Except for the very short "deep winter" in the south, every sunny Saturday and Sunday, or on holidays, the upper class would invite their lovers, hire a sampan, and float on the less than two-mile-long Lychee Bay.</p>
<p>The rental price of a sampan, including the labor of the rower, is only one or two dimes per hour. A bowl of sampan congee costs one dime; someone with my appetite can eat two bowls when not hungry, and three bowls when hungry.</p>

<h3>The Art of Getting Along in the World</h3>
<p>— Lu Ding</p>
<p>Whether you are in the Garden of Eden, whether you are in the Kingdom of Happiness, even if you are a favorite of heaven, every dream is inevitably dominated by the real environment.</p>
<p>This means that when a person reaches a certain age and time, there will always be a day to contact society and a day to struggle with the environment. If you do not have the art of getting along in the world, the result will be failure. Many people see the art of getting along in the world as a difficult task, but the art of getting along in the world is by no means difficult. Even if it is difficult, you should not fear it.</p>
<p>On the contrary! Many people see the art of getting along in the world as an easy task, but the art of getting along in the world is not easy. Even if it is easy, you should not ignore it.</p>
<p>Originally, an art, at least, has its own value. Of course, the art of getting along in the world is particularly important and particularly close to us.</p>
<p>Please ask those who are promoted to official positions and those who become rich, how did they achieve it? I don't believe they rely solely on their own abilities. I also don't believe they rely solely on their own good fortune. I am afraid that the art of getting along in the world has the greatest power. If so, sisters and brothers are exceptions.</p>
<p>To put it simply, the art of getting along in the world has the following characteristics. First, be aware of current affairs and watch the wind. Don't blunder about. Second, have a thick skin, don't be afraid of embarrassment, and don't be afraid of being laughed at. Third, be able to boast and flatter. If not, you can also use deception or intimidation.</p>
<p>These are the lessons that should be taught to those who have received long-term training in the specialized school of the art of getting along in the world. It is not enough to achieve them without sophisticated skills and insidious intentions.</p>
<p>Work hard, put your heart into it, and let's all study this art of getting along in the world.</p>

<p>Another year, and the autumn wind blows easily; restoring Liaoyang is being planned. Young men joining the army is truly joyful; in the wine house, they sing aloud, "The Great River Flows East."</p>
<p>Lost territories along Yan and Sui are being recovered one by one; under the green gauze canopy, arrows aim in hatred. The scholar's proclamation is like a giant brush; from now on, display a talent for killing the enemy.</p>

Is the stele of the Northern Song party still there? In vain, I hold the tears of serving the country.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Radium and its Applications</h3>
<p>— Meng Fu</p>
<p>Radium (Ra), abbreviated as radium, is a chemical element. It was discovered by the French chemists Mr. and Mrs. Curie. This element has many unique properties and is extremely relevant to the progress of modern chemistry and medicine.</p>
<p>Radium is widely distributed in various minerals, seawater, and some spring waters, but the amount is very small. Radium itself does not have crude ore; it is extracted from uranium ore. Most of the radium now available is extracted from a type of uranium ore called pitchblende. There are several pitchblende mines in the Belgian Congo region of Africa. However, the extraction of radium is one of the most difficult and expensive in mineral extraction chemistry. It is said that according to ordinary procedures, to obtain one ounce of radium, it is necessary to process 350 to 400 tons of crude ore. Moreover, the extraction methods are kept absolutely secret by each factory.</p>
<p>Radium is a white metal with a melting point of approximately 7000°C. It is easily altered in the air. Its chemical properties are similar to those of its sibling (barium), but it has another unique property, namely radioactivity. This action is actually a result of countless uranium atoms internally active. Here are some noteworthy strange phenomena: (1) Radium can emit light on its own, and this light is not caused by any kind of chemical combination. Therefore, even if it is placed in a vacuum, it can still emit light. (2) Radium can generate heat on its own, and this is not caused by any kind of chemical combination. (3) Radium can turn air into an electrical conductor. (4) Radium can emit several types of radiation (radial rays). This radiation can pass through opaque materials, such as black paper, wooden boards, and metal sheets, and cause changes in photographic film, similar to X-rays. Based on the different abilities to penetrate metal sheets, this radiation can be divided into three types: alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha is the most difficult to penetrate, and it has the effect of generating heat and turning air into an electrical conductor. Magnets can attract it and cause it to bend, and it clearly has positive electrical properties. Beta has greater penetrating power, and magnets can also bend it. Because the bending direction is opposite to that of alpha, it can be known that it has negative electrical properties. Gamma has the strongest penetrating power, and even iron sheets as thick as twelve inches can be penetrated. This radiation has the ability to cause changes in photographic film and turn air into an electrical conductor. However, it is not attracted by magnets, so this radiation is actually a type of wave action, not made of solid matter. (5) Radium can gradually change into various other substances. For example, if a small amount of air is passed over radium, this air will contain a radioactive gas. This gas was initially called radium emanation. Now scientists call it Neton.</p>
<p>Speaking of the application of radium, it lies in the treatment of what was previously called incurable cancer. Because cancer can only be treated with radium, there is simply no hope of recovery with other medicines. The method of treatment is to irradiate the cancerous area with the gamma radiation of radium. Then the cancer cells will gradually shrivel. If the cancer cells completely shrivel and die, then it will work. However, gamma radiation can also damage healthy tissues in the human body. Therefore, the application of radium must have surgical skills. Now there is a new method, which is to use radioactive gas, which is the previously mentioned Neton. Radium has no other important uses besides medical use. For example, it can be used as a self-luminous dye, such as on the hands of luminous watches, but it is not only too expensive, but also has substitutes. Thick metal photography can also be replaced by cheaper X-rays.</p>
<p>Finally, everyone should know that this radium is the most precious thing in the world. Initially, it was worth 300,000 gold dollars per ounce. Now, because more is produced, it is still worth 150,000 gold dollars per ounce. Of course, the reason why it is so expensive is nothing more than the scarcity of production and the difficulty of extraction. At the same time, the needs of the medical community are also a contributing factor. Although radium is expensive, it also has an advantage, that is, the loss of radiation is extremely small. Even after two thousand years, only half of the light intensity will be lost.</p>

<h3>Improvement of the Family System</h3>
<p>— Zong Wen</p>
<p>A Comparison of New and Old Families</p>
<p>The organization of the family is nothing more than two types: cohabitation system and separation system. The cohabitation system is the so-called old family, and the separation system is the so-called new family. Originally, almost everyone in China adopted the cohabitation system, as if it had become a custom from ancient times to the present. Thus, stories such as "Zhang Gong's Hundred Tolerances" and "Five Generations Under One Roof" have been passed down as good stories to this day. But is the old family really good? Or is the new family good? This is a question that is very worthy of research and discussion, and it is also a very important and urgent issue in society to be resolved.</p>
<p>The important principle of the old family is the so-called "cohabitation." Speaking of this, I am afraid that someone will ask me, "Aren't their fathers, brothers, spouses, sisters-in-law, etc. in the old family able to gather in one place, which is very happy?" Indeed, originally its disadvantage is gathering in one place. Why?</p>
<p>(1) Too many people are noisy, which easily leads to dependence. The reason why Chinese people have dependence is originally cultivated in the family. If the people are like this, how can the country not be like this?</p>
<p>(2) Ill feelings are easily generated among the members. From then on, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and sisters-in-law in the family will be suspicious of each other, and there will never be peaceful days. Even if the head of the family is very good, and the rest of the people are also very good, nothing will happen, right? But these are just some false masks of smiling faces and disunited hearts. In fact, can the personalities of all the people in a family be the same? As the saying goes, "One mother gives birth to nine sons, and even the mother has more than ten hearts." It's really well said. I assert, "The military nature of our country is probably also cultivated by the old family."</p>
<p>(3) Individuality cannot be freely developed, and an independent spirit cannot be cultivated.</p>
<p>(4) It is extremely difficult for the head of the family to deal with the members of the family.</p>
<p>(5) Comparison and jealousy are common to all people. In cohabiting families, laziness is often caused by comparison and jealousy. Every disadvantage must have an advantage. What is its advantage? This is talking about the economic aspect. In cohabiting families, property is pooled, which can increase the productivity. In terms of consumption, the consumption rate of cohabitation is small. For external economy, such as national taxation and social donations, they are mostly based on the family as a unit, so it is more economical than separation. Doesn't this point show that the old family also has advantages?</p>
<p>The important principle of the new family is the so-called "separation." Its advantages are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) By implementing the separation system, dependence can have no way to occur.</p>
<p>(2) After separation, not only will the friendship between brothers and sisters-in-law deepen, but also the feelings for parents-in-law will not be reduced at all. Because after separation, everyone can do their own things and be responsible for their own affairs. All the pain of restraint and the disadvantages of submission can be eliminated from now on. Mutual love and mutual help can be generated from now on.</p>
<p>(3) Individuality can be freely developed, and an independent spirit can be cultivated.</p>
<p>(4) After separation, family management is easier.</p>
<p>(5) After separation, although the same comparison and jealousy exist, the result is enough to make everyone strive to struggle.</p>
<p>In short, the advantages of cohabitation are limited to the material aspect, while the advantages of separation include the spiritual aspect. If the spiritual aspect is already sound, even if the material aspect is slightly consumed, it can be remedied. Moreover, because of careful planning, it can be saved instead, so why not do it?</p>
<p>Looking at the above points of comparison, the question of whether the old family is good or the new family is good can also be easily solved.</p>

<h3>Interesting Anecdotes Heard and Seen at Banquets</h3>
<p>— Ya Shi</p>
<p>Giving Cigarette Butts as Gifts</p>
<p>At the end of last month, my friend Mr. × mentioned that his friend Mr. ×, who had just left school for a few days, had obtained the nice position of magistrate of × County in × Province. This was such a glorious thing! He was going to take office that day, and I still needed to congratulate him. But I felt lonely on the way alone, and I thought you could go with me. I wonder what your opinion is? When I heard this, I was really envious and agreed to go together.</p>
<p>On that day, I dressed up and went forward with my friend Mr. ×. Arriving outside the lane, a greeter came forward to welcome us and walked into the lane together. Upon entering the door, I saw that the room was decorated with red knots everywhere and was extremely lively. The congratulatory guests were all erudite scholars. Everyone chatted for a long time. We were seated at the table, and the dishes were all delicacies from land and sea. The deliciousness need not be mentioned.</p>
<p>Only on the table across from us, there were piles of silver shields, calligraphy and paintings, bird's nest, ginseng, and everything precious. However, there was a box (about six or seven inches square and about two inches high) with particularly brocaded covering, with an unusually striking color. It must contain something that money cannot buy (my ideal). But I don't know how many silver dollars the owner of this gift spent. At that time, the recipient (the new magistrate) also felt curious and hurriedly came forward to open the box to see what kind of valuable thing it was. Just as the box was opened, the host turned red in the face and ran back into the room like a tiger turning over a mountain. The guests at the table were all surprised and stopped their cups when they saw this.</p>
<p>One of them immediately stood up and said with a smile, "Everyone, don't be suspicious of that small flower box. It is my respectful gift. My younger brother and the magistrate are classmates and are known to be close friends. Because I know that his esteemed self loves to eat cigarette butts the most, when we were classmates many years ago, the cigarette butts left over by our classmates were all left for him to eat. He liked it very much. Even the cigarette butts that were stepped on on the ground, he would pick them up to eat. Therefore, I specially presented a box today to bring joy. Who knew that the magistrate now no longer likes this thing? I am really out of touch." When the guests heard this, they all giggled and laughed non-stop. After a long time, the banquet ended, and after drinking fragrant tea, everyone thanked each other and returned home.</p>
