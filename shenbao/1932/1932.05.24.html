<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本新内閣之前途彬</h3>
<p>自犬養首相遇剌殂逝吾人即斷言日本必組超然内閣今齋籐己奉命繼任總揆。超然内閣之勢己成。吾人之言果騐。蓋勢至今日。除以超然内閣代政黨内閣而興外。絶無他道也。</p>
<p>犬養殂逝而後。繼任組閣之人物。以國本社領袖平沼與政友會新總裁鈴木之呼聲爲最高但究竟鹿死誰手頗難捉模迨西園寺晋京審察形勢。旣不能不勉徇軍部組織超然内閣之意見。復不敢予政黨以難堪。乃决然捨去爲政潮中心人物之平沼與鈴木。齋籐乃得拜受大命然而齋籘以一人緩衝中流爲浪潮之所集。如何應付此一艱局。博取各方面之好感。自爲絶大之困難。故新内閣之閣員人選。煞費躊躇。其難產亦自在意中。</p>
<p>雖然。新内閣之成立要終當於日内寳現吾人固不必費心推敲吾人今所應注意者。應爲新内閣產生而後。其前途如何其影響於世界者又如何。</p>
<p>吾人認爲齋藤之組閣。與其謂爲由於西園寺之推薦。毋寗謂爲軍部主張</p>
<p>之勝利。吾人前已數言日本法西斯蒂運動。今已達到最高峯。而法西勢力所以抬頭之原因。則實由於經濟凋敝。不景氣日益加深。左傾運動日益激化之剌激。處於此經濟恐慌狂潮之下。社會之一切矛盾。一切危機。必都伺隙而發。政黨内閣旣無以遏止此危機。穏定政治。超然内閣亦未必遂有此可能。即純軍人内閣實現。竭力厲行法西主義。鎭壓反動。要亦無以阻遏時代之狂潮故齋藤内閣處於當前時代浪潮激盪之下。亦不過爲一過度時代之橋梁而已。其前途而有若何之光明。而有若何長永之政治生命。吾人殊不敢信。</p>
<p>齋藤内閣成立之後。必以軍部之意志爲意志。換言之。即必厲行軍國主義。對外加緊醖釀對美對蘇之戰爭。對我貫澈强硬之政策。對内亦必厲行法西政治。竭力鎭壓左傾運動。以剌激左傾運動之愈益激化。十三日大阪朝日新聞曾載有大竹博吉之論文。懼日美戰時。蘇聯從中搗亂使日本蘇維埃化。故主張對蘇緩和。然日美戰爭一起。世界立即捲入旋渦。日本在大戰期間。果能不發生突然之變動耶。總之日本之政治。今已如脫覊之馬。絶塵邁馳。不可駕馭。其前途固不容樂觀也。</p>

<p>大阪每日新聞云、際此國民生活壓迫、政界潮流急變之時、非常時内閣說、醖釀正劇、其間活動最著者、可分爲八派、即安逹一派之協力内閣運動、該派有多數策士、奔走畫策、惟該派因國民大衆對於政黨政治之信任如何、與西園寺之意嚮如何、尙難預卜、但目下當否認政黨改造政黨與政黨協力等交錯線上、因時局之切迫、非常時内閣、究由如何形態而造成、亦爲最近之重大問題　杳可爲非常時内閣之首班者、不外東鄉元帥·齋藤實·山本權兵衛·尾崎行雄·伊澤喜多·宇垣一成·平沼騏一郎等七人、但亦有擁護現任參謀總長閑院宫載仁親王、與海軍軍令部長伏見宫博恭王二人、主張擁護東鄉元帥者爲薩派中人、即倣德國興登堡之前例、齋藤實自辭朝鮮總督職後、即奔走協力内閣運動、山本權兵衛、亦有、部分人擁戴、他如崇拜咢堂派去年外游返國之尾崎行雄氏、亦有擁立新運動、然軍部少壯將校中、憤旣成政治家之腐敗、與二三年來心境變化尙自由主義之老鬭將、多傾向於祖國主義、伊澤喜多氏在民政黨改造後、曾有擁立風聞、以上諸說紛紜、尙無歸結、最近以國本社爲號召·與荒木一派提携之平沼擁立運動、與軍部宇垣派相聨絡、民政黨一部之宇垣大將擁立運動、己漸具體化、蓋國本社之中心人物、如荒木陸相大角海相太田耕造等、具有絶大的勢力、而平沼無妻無子、在市外西大久保私邸、度其類似僧侣之生活、何以得各實力者之擁立、因平沼除任樞密院副議長外、以國本社爲中心與軍部有密切關係故也、若平沼崛起、則有軍部各　　　　　　　　　背景　細羅幾多人才確立强力内閣　他大小無數政客、圍繞於平沼與國本社者、亦皆欲聨袂而起、其中如犬養内閣之書記長森恪、最爲露骨之人、苟平沼内閣成立、國本社必有强烈的大　民運動發生、又組閣後實行政策時、不得不維持永續的組織勢力、旣成政黨、自歸消滅、然旣成政黨、經半世紀以上之奮鬭築成今日之地盤、一舉而樹新政黨之旗、恐亦勢所不能、至於宇垣一成大將、曩時有加入民政黨之運動、今民政黨中之擁戴宇垣派、與軍部之宇垣系相聨絡、企國繼若槻之後而代以宇垣、宇垣若出、則依憲政之常道式、其政權恐不歸於民政黨、否則在宇垣之下、以民政黨爲主體、成立政黨聨立人才内閣、惟軍部中之反宇垣系、果能同意與否、亦一疑問、又如在政界表面活動之中野正剛所提倡社會國民主義·與下中彌三郎·赤松克磨等之國家社會主義·以及大日本生產黨·愛國勤勞黨等各政派之策動、亦甚猛烈中野正剛在新黨樹立以前、游說全國各地、宣傳社會國民主義、頗得國民之同情、但中野之政治勢力薄弱、故究難實現、要之、在此混沌情勢之下、各派均盡其活動力、暗中飛躍、未知鹿死誰手、頗堪注目、</p>
<h3>大阪每日新聞日美戰機切迫（再續）</h3>
<p>美國第　流外交家蘭辛、以一九一五年之中日交涉經過所提出國務卿勃拉安之對日抗議、顯然以擁護美國之利益爲目的、然巴黎威爾遜·與華盛頓許士、不啻爲中國之僕役、專迎合中國人之心理、排斥日本之要求·與非議日本之權益、藉保護中國之幸福相標榜、假道義爲楯、而巧弄實利之槍、實爲最近外交史上美國政治家之伎倆、無怪美國之極東政策頗受中國人之歐迎、即如近代中國人中、思慮比較精深之孫中山、對於日本、亦謂爲「帝國主義的一外交」、而對於美國、則謂爲「友誼的一外交」、妄分日美兩國之差異、訓練美國式的方法、於是排日媚美之風、幾遍全國、且前駐美公使施肇基、在美發揮其迎合性、與美國資本家締結陜西之煤·四川之煤油等開採契約、一面將鼓吹有害無益之日英同盟廢棄、以中國爲舞臺、擬結成Ａ.Ｂ.Ｃ.同盟、（即Ａ爲Ａmerica,B.爲British,　C.爲China）</p>
<p>日俄戰爭後、最近二十年間、美國之態度、在世界上可謂「堂堂擁護中國者」、故彼對於日本、突下最後之鐵槌、當然根據歷來傳統的虛榮心、以與日本抗衡也、</p>
<p>滿洲問題、與美國之關係、旣如是複雜、當滿洲事變勃發時、美國之態度、究竟發生如何感想、吾人就最近之事實以證之、（一）居指導對外政策之現大總統胡佛、其思想的骨子、素重功利主義、故美國對於滿洲問題、處於退守的局勢、日前米拉土評論胡佛曰、「胡佛之思想、原非政治家而爲實業家」、距彼任商務卿時代己逹十年之今日、仍不出其功利主義之範圍、凡對於自國之存立、無關緊要問題、决不願拚自國之運命而與他人爭也、蓋其洞鑒利害得失、尤不願有積極的干涉、</p>
<p>當滿洲事變之前、適值美國有史以來未聞之經濟國難、失業者激增、對於基礎薄弱之地方銀行、亦不得不謀救濟、舉國社會、頓呈不安、大總統胡佛、在林肯紀念席上演說云、現當經濟國難之衝、對於」有形之敵」、實較無形之敵」爲可慮、况美國今日之海軍現勢力、比日本海軍爲劣、如欲有所干涉、須有充分强大之武力、爲其保障、今旣乏强大武力爲後盾、自不能有何等之威嚴、旣無威嚴而貿然干涉、反自遭敗戰之禍、故當滿洲事變勃發時、美國雖欲出而干涉、亦勢所不許也、（未完）</p>

<h3>英報評犬養暗殺日圖征服大陸</h3>
<p>東京報知新聞云、自犬養首相被害英國全國、非常驚駭、國内各黨、均有嚴重之批評、如保守黨之機關報、謂統觀日本之現狀、反動派受陸海軍將校之支配、彼等政治之目的、以超愛國的軍國主義、實行征服大陸、與國家的膨脹政策、即今後日本爲己國利益、由軍國主義者之野心所起之爭鬥、依然不能解决、又自由黨方面之機關報評曰、此次凶變威脅政府、蓋欲實行軍人獨裁政策、然日本因目下平和主義者之思想勃興、故若萬一革命發生、究竟是否實行軍事革命、尙難預料、但日本派遣多數軍隊於滿洲、勢將與俄引起正面衝突、果爾、則國際聨盟與其他列强、爲恐發生慘禍計、亦不能袖手旁觀耳</p>

<h3>火燒日船續誌</h3>
<p>全船留一空壳</p>
<p>軍火損失甚多</p>
<p>日軍運輸船孟買丸、（昨報誤爲廣福丸）在黃浦碼頭失火、己誌昨報、茲將續訊、分誌如下、</p>
<h3>續運日軍</h3>
<p>江灣吳淞閘北各處之日本陸軍、均在撤退中、日本陸軍省此次調來運兵船共八艘、先後離滬者己有四艘、而二十二日復有日軍十八旅團之步兵一聨隊、十九聨隊中之步兵一大隊、飛行隊第九大隊、又砲兵一大隊繼續撤退、由日輪江蘇丸運載赴東洋、其餘大隊則定二十四五兩天載出、</p>
<h3>起火原因</h3>
<p>孟買丸與哈爾濱丸等均停在楊樹浦之黃浦碼頭、備裝從吳淞閘北撤退之日本第九師團内之步兵一大隊、砲兵兩隊、飛行隊一大隊特種兵、與通信隊等、預定二十四及二十五兩天離滬、故軍用汽油與示用之炸彈手溜彈、及飛機用之重量爆裂彈等先行下船、兵十等須今天上輪也、軍械彈藥汽油方裝船内、二十二日上午七時、船内突然失愼、其起火原因、據稱由遺火入彈藥而爆裂、延燒入飛機用汽油、故火勢至盛、無法撲息、</p>
<h3>延燒猛烈</h3>
<p>日本海軍在該運輪失火後、以碼頭上尙有大宗軍火及子彈炸彈等、裝入哈爾濱丸中、而碼頭棧房内存儲彈藥更夥、萬一船内火勢蔓延不止、流入碼頭或哈爾濱丸輪中、勢成巨禍、遂派船將孟買丸拖到高喬沙附近之江面上抛泊、一面由海關救火輪、及日海軍之救火器等、協同助救、無如船内彈藥過多、一時難以撲滅、</p>
<h3>繼續爆裂</h3>
<p>該輪延燒至昨日下午、己歷三十餘小時、而火燄仍未稍息、初時尙祇一部分燒着、後則全輪波及、非射水可以撲滅、故日軍聽其自燒、直至今日午刻、船内彈藥猶未燒完、故在午刻、輪中尙有極大之爆裂聲、後經調查、係屬船中所裝之大砲彈和飛機炸彈之着火爆炸、因之至下午火勢仍復熾烈、凡船體内部之内台甲艙位機器等、己完全燬失、</p>
<h3>加派運輪</h3>
<p>在滬日軍、急待運日、孟買丸失火後、至昨日己經查明、全輪燒燬、即引擎等項亦己炸破、僅留一空壳、輪體損失至少四十萬元、此船爲日郵社之輪、由陸軍省所調用者、船内炸去之軍火、亦有值十餘萬元者、日陸軍省得報、急派常盤丸輪來滬、代替孟買丸裝運日軍歸國、撤退各隊、准今明兩天離滬、昨日黃浦碼頭、仍在裝運軍用品也、</p>

<h3>各團體救國會反對圓桌會議</h3>
<p>糾正英僑協會建議宣言</p>
<p>上海各團體救國聨合會反對日本勾串外橋破壞上海領土主權宣言云、自二十年九一八以來各國所遵守國聨盟約·非戰公約·與九國公約·被暴日破壞盡矣、所幸世界眞理尙未盡泯、各友邦尙能主張公道、致暴日在東省與上海之領土野心、不敢公然宣逞、乃不圖暴日爲上項國際公約所拘束、其暴力所攫取者、在法理上不能生效、意必以種種鬼蜮伎倆、勾串在滬之少數外僑、陰謀促成圓桌會議、以設立所謂自由市、在明逹之友邦人士、自不至爲其利用與摇惑、惟頃見報載有英人胡特海者、以英僑協會名義、致各國商會一函、意欲慫恿各國政府、召集圓桌會議、解决上海今後之地位、其不顧國際公約、竟與日本同一狂暴、本會對於此等宣傳、認爲中英友誼最大之遺憾、查上海爲中國人之上海、除洋涇浜章程規定條欵外、其行政主權之完整與獨立、任何人不得侵犯、非特有國際最高憲章國聨盟約第十條、足資保障、而各國政府與人民之不能協定或協議或諒解足以侵犯我國之領土主權、尤有九國公約第一第二第四各條之明白規定、最近國聨之歷次决議、與美國之胡佛主義、亦莫不以此爲主臬、想主張正義之英僑、斷不能抺殺此國際憲章、而自墮其在世界之榮譽也、抑考一八六二年之際、外僑有藉口上海騷亂而倡立自由市者、英使白羅司曾力闢其逹國際公法而寢其議、詎今十年後、而倡立自由市者、反出自英僑、此固少數人、受暴日之愚弄、誠不能不爲英僑太息也、至該胡特海所持之理由、曰在（一）解决越界築路之管理權、（二）免除上海周圍駐紥華軍之危險、（三）改良特區法院之辦理訴訟問題、若不召集圓桌會議、殊無以保障租界之安全、殊不知彼所指之第一點、係地方事件、究應如何辦法、自有己成章規可資循按、又有地方當局、可資解决、豈容任何人不遵軌道妄加干涉、其所指之第二項曞</p>
<p>匪特提出此議、即有害我國行政主權之獨立、抑且抺殺一二八事件、係暴日利用租界屯兵所釀出之事實、各外僑果不忘正義、應秉嚴度、以懲戒暴日之破壞租界治安則租界和平、自有保障、乃不此之圖、而以防範中國駐兵之危險爲口實、試問數十年來中國軍隊、幾曾危及租界、此種偏袒暴日之口吻、實可不攻自破、至所指第三項、尤爲我國主權所繫、不容外人置喙、且自法院成立後、除少數外僑律師收入略减外、並無其他不便之事、本會愛護本國領土主權、尤愛護國際各種公約、仍有破壞國際公約危害我國領土主權者、惟有本正義公道、相與周旋、茲爲喚起上海各外僑之注意謹宣言如下（一）圓桌會議之歷史意義、爲宗主國對殖民地而設者、此種名詞、有辱及我國家之獨立、吾人斷不能忍辱、（二）上海事件、與東省事件、係中日間之整個問題、絶不能單獨解决且如何解决、吾人在法理上所信任者只有國聨盟約及九國公約不知其他、（三）上海爲中國領土、反對任何人或任可國有變更我原有行政組織行政方式者之任何企圖、以侵犯我主權尤其反對企圖產生所謂自由市之圓桌會議、以上三點、爲吾人對上海問題所堅持之態度、甚望各明逹之外僑、對胡氏之說、予以嚴厲之糾正尤盼與日人接近之外僑、認清日本今次暴行之性質、勿作迹近分贓之錯舉、倘不幸少數人利令智昏、甘爲暴日所利用、俾胡氏之說、繼續傳播、則本會惟有率領三百萬民衆、誓死奮鬭、以保國際公约之尊嚴、與我國領土主權之完整、即使淪上海爲荒廢之墟、亦斷不使所謂自由市出現、海枯石爛、此志不渝、惟中外人士、其昭鑒之特此鄭重宣言、</p>

<h3>自來水公司聲述用水表制理由</h3>
<p>上海自來水以司書記兼總理華爾德爲水表制聲述理由云、茲爲聲述創用水表制計算水費事、關於此事、去年業經工部局核准、且該時上海房產業主公會（萬國之會）及上海房產公會（華人會）、均無反對、何以至今竟有宣傳者、謂其效力係爲增加水費云云、查以上所宣傳者、殊與事實不合、按使用水表制、其效力即是用戸能照所使用水料之實在量數付費、决不似現在宅内所用者、其水費按租金計算也、法租界及閘北均用水表制、且在美國、此制亦庶乎通行、即歐洲多數國家、亦無不施用此制、</p>
<p>或謂、某產業如用水表計算、比較現在之費、增加五倍云云、然照彼處現在所用水料之量數、比較現在所付之價、實超過五倍、現己將此事查明、在該處所使用之水料、實非宅仙用水者、故以此事即爲使用水表制之效力、殊屬援引錯誤、</p>
<p>現在想預定任何一處所用之水料是多寡、實屬難能、總須將來查看經過如何、始以明瞭、故用戸不必預料有否艱難之處、如將來用水表制、其水費有超過刻下包月費較遠時、屆時應即詳查原因、以資證明、且業主或房客之用戸、果能與公司合作、總能將用水之量數、限制至合理之度數、</p>
<p>用水表之大意者、實爲免去濫用水料也、且其較遠目的、即係比包月制價廉、并無增加餘利之可言、因其餘利、乃係照工部局與自來水公司所訂之合同而定也、</p>
<p>又有某某業主、擬將業主承包一片房屋水費之習慣註銷、并在用水表制時、每房客另裝分表云云、惟此事當討論現在水價率時、己經充分研究、不過按施行以前之水價率時、敝公司有權令一片房產之業主、負該一片房產之水費、此實歷來之習慣）并法租界及閘北公司）尋常亦或如此辦理、在英美兩國亦有類似之事、且在新式大樓内分租房屋者、用業主名義承包各房客水費、亦係普通辦法、當在施行新水價率時、按照某某業主要求、遂改變此情、但尋常仍有與業主成立合同者、可是業主有權、令公司在任何地方與各房客、成立合同、如是以上之水管改置費、須均由業主負担、且須在公司方面、存放足以相抵另水表價值之押櫃金、如產業轉移他人或水表拆去時、該押櫃金、依然付還、雖押櫃金之利息、相當水表價之利息、而維持調查號碼及收欵等之格外費用、均由水價率内補助、故其改變水管費用及押櫃金、令業主負責者、初視似乎稍差、及至以後即可渙然冰釋矣、緣改變水管費用、實符合業主與公司訂立合用時所省餘之欵、換主之、即當初置水管時、具按置方法、即有與各用戸成立合同之可能、此不過增加該水管之原價了、再各戸另裝水表所需、其格外費用、結果須增加水價、且其利益、祇能與用戸一部分、故必照水價率所列各條欵、方稱公允、</p>
<p>又業主可先於各一片房產處、裝一總水表、按所有統計觀察、在相似之處、及相似房租之房屋所用之水料、并不相同、互相所差甚遠、在費用水料過多之處、總有特别原因、故此總須詳爲查明、如公司及業主之努力、减少費用水料仍然無效、至是時業主如欲辦時、仍可照以上之條件、俾各用戸另裝水表、</p>
<p>倘向虑界各處諮詢意見、庶乎完全贊成用水表制、即如美國俾特斯巴　（譯音）濾水委員會、當一八九九年時業經聲述、「用戸大多數係爲合理之用水者、并無濫用之處、祇有少數用戸、因疏忽或濫用、放出大量之水數與地溝内、其結果、必至增加應供給水之量數、及個人應負之水費、於是必致因少數用戸、濫用水料所成之損失、使本城全體居民、任其賠償、如各用戸裝用水表、其濫用者須自己出費、可免他人代負、即他人之水費、亦能减少、」云云、又一九零一年、美國工程師總會之年刋第四十六纂内特若特偉納（譯音）君演說、「現下工程專門家、不必研討限制濫用水料之事、而全體亦庶乎無不同意、其限制濫用方法、惟不幸者、在美國城鎭内、多數之水廠、經理者係多爲無專門知識之外行委員會所經理、且多聽從大多數無知識之意見、」云云、又法國巴黎水廠前任總理云、「用水表者、可使用戸隨意取用水料之量數、而水廠方面有恒久及最準之監督、故用戸無用水料即不付費、水廠方面所供給之水料、均可完全收價、」云云、又在新式大欓内分租房屋者、業主房客、在用水表時之感情、（在歐西各國、此項房屋、即類乎中國之一片房屋、）對此問題、有黑遜（譯音）君、曾著水廠用水表制之價律一書、（在一九一八年）内云、「所取水料總數、是業主負責、如房客濫用、必致業主吃虧、故時生糾葛、甚全於擬採用水表制、均難創辦、嗣後業主漸知費水原因、是爲水具、破壞漏水、無人過問所致、故將水具常常修理、庶不致將水欵漲大、且各房另裝水表、如自來水電燈等）實屬困難、因設置水管之故、然亦不能云不能辦、不過無甚利益耳、」云云、按以上所說、可謂上海自來水之艱難、與世界各處自來水之艱難、大抵相同、故在他處採用水表制、可解决此種艱難、而在上海若採用水表制、亦許能得同樣之結果、</p>
<p>本地自來水問題、當討論時、應注意其水廠股東之利息、因其利息、係訂定不變者、故此所售出水料之價、直接從製水輪水之總費而定、如總費高昻、水價亦必爲之高昻、如總數减低、水價亦必因之減低、故採用增加總費方法、直接必將水價增加、所以如勉强在各小房屋另裝水表、其用水之费、實不足相抵、其裝置維持觀看水表等費用、如此雖爲業主方便起見、但此法實與經濟不合、其結果總須增加公共所負之水費、反言之、如用不經濟之方法、實足使居民全體蒙其損失、</p>
<p>現爲創辦水表制、將本界分成幾個小區、此事前己說明、勿庸再詳、茲特簡言之、其各區陸續裝置水表、俟設備完成時、即用水表制計算水費、刻下業己在兩區内設備完竣、己將新合同發送、該兩區内各用戸、其業己簽字送還者、固在多數、而其聽信外邊宣佈遲延觀望者、亦有數處、望欬數處將新合同早日簽字送還、以免將來發生糾紛、實爲至荷、</p>

<h3>古廟敲鐘錄（四）不除庭草齋夫</h3>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>天上的星是不斷的在運行。他們每天從東邊起來，經過我所立的子午線，向着西邊走去。我用漏壺與天星比較，看出一件很奇怪的事。我拿一個兩尺長的大竹筒，兩頭打通，向外的一頭用一根絲線做直徑緊粘在筒上使平分筒口爲三半圓。再將這竹筒使筒日絲線配進子午線安在一個架上使竹筒能上下轉動。等到一顆星走近子午線的時候，我使將竹筒上下轉動去瞄準這顆星，當這顆星走到絲線上的時候我便檢查漏壺裏的水滴到了那一格。眞奇怪，過十五天，這顆星是提早一小時中天，過一個月，牠是提早二小時中天，過十二個月牠是提早二十四小時中天。</p>
<p>我起初懷疑漏壺出毛病。後來有一位游客在我們廟裏住了七天。他帶來了一個圓而扁的怪物。他說這個怪物呌做錶，短針每半天轉一周爲十二小時，長針每小時轉一周爲六十分，一點也不差。我拿道錶來着北斗之天樞星每天經過竹筒口中線時間，我察出每過一天則天樞星是提早四分鐘經過。這與漏壺比較的結果恰合，每天提早四分鐘，半個月恰是一小時，後來又有一位客人帶來一個更精細的錶，一分一秒都能報告出來。拿這個東西試了幾天，我察出每個星宿第二夜比第一夜是提早三分五十六秒中天。拿這個數目乘一年的日數三六五日五時四八分四六秒差不多是總共提早二十四小時。</p>
<p>我爲什麽要這樣囉唆呢？因爲我那晚鐘曉鐘之所以能夠準時的敲，全靠這一點。我先用臉兒朝北去找北斗七星。次找七星中之天樞天璇二星。如斗柄朝右，天樞天璇就在極左，天璇在南，天樞在北。次從天璇出一線到天樞再伸長五倍便遇着靠近北極之北極星。次以北極星做中心觀察天樞天璇聨線之旋轉，便推定了一年之二十四節氣和一日之二十四小時。爲便利起見，我取一個小孩子玩的大鐵圈，用十二根缐做鐵圈的十二道直徑，各以相等弧度交於圈之中心。這十二根交缐便把鐵圈分成二十四等分，每等分成爲十五度。每隔十五度畫「個方向。共二十四向。那四個正向是正東，正南，正西，正北。次把圈心之交點對準北極星，將正南正北二點切合子午線·那末！正東是靠右手，正西是靠左手。次看天樞天璇聨缐落在圈中那個方向，只要知道是何節氣便知道是何時間，只要知道是何時間便知道是何節氣。比如晚上八時天樞天璇聨缐春分在東南，立夏便在正南，夏至便在西南，立秋便在正西，秋分便在西北，立冬便在正北，冬至便在東北也是照這樣推定的。每小時星行十五度，相隔八小時即移動一百二十度。如晚八時是在正南早四時則必在西偏北三十度了。每過一天，星兒北斗在極北，不易看見，我便用王良一等星代替。早三分五十六秒中天，若在一定的時間觀察，這星是自東由南向西移動不到一度光景，（五十九分多）每節氣移動十五度。因此每夜敲鐘的鐘點都因星行方位而規定。諸位伯是有些不耐煩了。我說了這一大套只是表明我受了衆人付托擔任這個敲鐘的職務是不敢絲毫苟且。我知道我的辦法，照天文學嚴格的說起來！還不能算是最正確。可是在可能範圍之内我這個鄉下孩子是努燕了力了。當然，我還在追求那最正確的敲法咧。</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市在停頓中五底結賬……雙方觀望</h3>
<p>棉紗市情極蕭散、實需大爲岑寂、又以五月底結賬之期銀根愈緊、各帮尤無生氣、以致人心十分萎挫、但廠方意態尙鎭靜、故現紗市價尙堪維持不動、惟形勢異常滯鈍、故環境雖惡化、然新抛戸未鑡踴躍、多數心理均持觀望態度、所以勢成殭局、須待節後客銷方面、或有活動之氣、但照大勢測之、深恐希望有限云、</p>
<h3>人標籌碼絶少</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、以金價趨升、致塲中賣戸稍缺、各月漲四五錢、但交易極清、所以收盤甚早、因籌碼太少、午後標紗各月又漲一二錢、全日成交統計三千二百包、查賣出同孚二百包、振大一百包、森康三百五十包、長豐三百五十包、永大一百包、買進賡豐一百五十包瑞大二百包、愼記四百包、吉豐二百包、信誠一百包協生一百包、茲將人標收盤價分列如下、</p>

<h3>棉市無大起伏外棉亦在徘徊中</h3>
<p>棉市仍平靜之局、暫時恐無大變遷、蓋以塲中買賣缺乏、兼之目前情形、仍屬暗淡、至於外棉亦在徘徊停滯中、故現在起伏甚微、升降祇五至十磅音、而上海各廠消費甚少、且外棉價格仍廉、各廠一時難有進胃云、</p>
<p>鄭標微漲　鄭標前市開盤、以美棉雖跌、而金價又升騰、致人心略堅、各月漲五分、惟寗波帮賣出一千二百擔、午後又漲五分、全日成交統計四千三百擔、查賣出同孚三百擔、恒益三百擔、天隆四百擔、餘昶一千二百擔瑞源二百擔、買進信誠三百擔、長和四百擔、顧大二百擔、新亨三百擔、義源四百擔、茲將鄭標收盤價分列如下、</p>

<p>紐約五月廿日電告一週棉市狀况云、本週原棉市况起落參差、價落時之同業購進與缺方補入、足以造成穏定之人心、國會未有平衡美國預算之迅速進行、證劵市塲復有不如人意之行動、故失望而出售者、頗有其人、但南方並無出售壓力、而價格己覺甚低、故市價續跌時、買風輒起買賣雙方無積極動作、足見市人欲待華盛頓官塲行動及棉作與商業狀况之發展也、過去一星期中、棉作發育較緩、因西南濕度低而陰、東南又覺土壤乾燥、惟棉作進行雖緩、並不影響市塲人氣、至於棉田增减一層、一般意見顯無變更、棉業中人大都以爲棉作開始良好、日本在南方之需求、業己减少、内地售出無多、基礎價格尙穏、</p>
<h3>孟買棉業週訊</h3>
<p>上週期貨營業、因地方騷亂、幾全停頓、歐洲及遠東、對於平果爾、雖有問訊、成交甚少、此外更有一不振之原因、即棉田將益行擴大是也、現貨方面、因紗布需要不佳、本地廠家存棉甚足、當然毫無起色可言、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包、</p>

<h3>現粉市極平靜</h3>
<p>昨現粉市面、大致呈平靜之態、因各路銷塲、均見停滯、市塲交易、異常寂寞、兵船開價、初尙穏定、旋因客帮無甚動辦、故收價减低五厘、開二兩零三分半、紅藍車因所有棧單、均在本街手中、價反提高、開二兩零四分二厘半、交易甚少、不過應酬而己、觀察後步、以新麥將次登塲、各方均在觀望之中、後步恐呈盤旋之象云、</p>

<h3>蔡孑民讀拉丁文</h3>
<p>— 賴</p>
<p>吾幼時讀外國書很困難。字典，文規，都没有，法文文規是吾譯的，拉丁文通還是吾爲震旦編的講義。</p>
<p>那時蔡孑民，張菊生，汪康年三人都硬要讀拉丁，我勸他們單讀英文，法文，比較實用些。他們都不肯，說是拉丁是西洋文字之源，不可不讀。於是不得不依了他們。後來敎他們讀羅馬謝雪廬Gicero的文集。蔡，張，汪，輩青年求學的熱誠眞可佩！吾還記得蔡孑民在徐家匯南洋公學敎書，吾住在土山灣前面的樓房裏，孑民每晨必從南洋公學步行而來，約摸有四五里路，從吾讀拉丁，有時竟在五點鐘的時候，天還没有亮，孑民己在外邊低聲喊呌：「相伯！相伯！」吾很希奇，老淸早己有人來看吾，吾就開窗下望，原來，就是蔡孑民，吾急忙摇着手，對他說：「太早了，太早了。八九點鐘再來吧！蔡孑民這好孩子不得不敗興而去。</p>
<h3>什刹海之夏鸚哥</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>丨故都雜冩之五丨</p>
<p>熱烈的陽光無遮無蔽的直射到地面，楊柳垂着頭微妙地在喘氣。人們被這灼熱的雰圍蒸出了一點汗，懶慵慵地怕得走動，不知在什麽樹的頂上傳送來一陣蟬聲，這好像在說，盛夏己經到了。</p>
<p>吃罷午餐，差不多是熱度最高的時候，尤其在這沙漠般的故城裏，泥土中的濕分了全部被蒸騰著，假如你不找一個清凉的所在去把這永晝度過，那麽你也許要爲這天氣而煩躁了。</p>
<p>約摸是一點鐘的光景，我和諤兩人耐不住在書屋裏坐着，也没平日那種翻帖讀碑的興趣，終於冒着酷熱的太陽，踱過寂寞的長街，直到什刹海來，途中祇有光亮的陽光躺着，駝鈴都没有聽得一聲。</p>
<p>到了什刹海，什刹海己經被佈置得和避暑的山莊一樣，在廣大的長滿荷葉的水流邊，接連地架着很多的茅蓬，可是四圍全都開敞着，可以避開陽光的晒照而有凉風的輕拂，這委實是個消度這漫漫永畫的適宜地帶，我和諤倆就泡了一壺茶，揀了塊比較幽靜的地方坐下了。坐了一會，覺得身上凉爽了點，於是又想走動一下。什刹海的邊兒上被連接的凉蓬和小攤的布幔夾成了一條長街，長街上有着如織的游人，穿着艶麗衣裳的所謂北國濃裝的小脚女人，正和蝴蝶般的在人羣中顯耀她們如花一樣的姿態，並且那雙靈活的眸子不時地在疎疎的髮絲下瞟你一眼，或是將描金的小扇捲這荒蕪的什刹海點飾成迷人的宫闋，恍如這盛夏呀己經回復到花香鳥語的春日，而年年酷熱的夏天，當我困頓在旅途的時候，我便不由得會想起了這不勝神往的什刹海了。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>傳熱的糊墻紙英國新近發明一種傳熱的糊墻紙。糊在墻壁上。能使室中發生温和的熱度。經過了幾度試騐。己告成功。加那大太平洋鐵道公司的定期郵船「栗區孟公爵夫人號Duchessof　Richmond中。曾在幾間客艙的天花板上糊着這種糊墻紙。即使在極冷的天氣。也覺得一室生春。這發明的起端。是由於飛行家所穿的一種特製的衣服。他們在寒天飛行。或飛到天空中極高的高度。就不得不穿這種傳熱的衣服。其製法是將無線電細銅絲。網一般織在衣料中。通以電流。便可傳熱。而絶不覺得寒冷之苦了。那傳熱的糊墻紙的發明。正與此大同小異。所用紙料是隔離而不會燃燒的。細電線通在紙背。表面上却一些也看不見。好像普通的糊墻紙一樣。到得電流一通。四壁便生出温和的暖氣來。</p>

<h3>南北兩十九</h3>

<p>敵宼淞滬。戍守是邦之衛國將士。十九路軍也。以三萬之師。當四倍之敵。以血肉之軀。當犀利之械。苦戰匝月。迭敗巨宼。十九軍之忠勇英武。不第我國人歌頌弗己。舉世之圓顱方踵莫不崇敬有加也。今也辱國之停戰協定簽字矣。咄彼倭人。以淞滬不足慮乃舍南而北。再以全力圖我東省。北望長空。山海關之風雲緊急無似矣。此間之守將。何柱國也。何所統衆。十九旅也。南方之十九。吾人己見其以拚死精神。予敵大創爭得民族光榮提高國際地位。惜乎阻於僉侫。不獲以竟全功。則繼起殺賊。惟有屬望於北方之十九矣。報載倭兵要求榆關内八十里地方有自由剿匪之權。何旅長告之曰。「中國領土内之土匪。自有中國軍隊剿除。勿勞他人代庖。本人之旅長與人不同。如有危害我轄境内人民者。决以全力與之周旋。本人雖粉身碎骨亦所不懼。」寥寥數語。大義凛然。吾人固知北方之十九亦能抗日無疑也。當關一卒。不讓胡騎侵凌。大厦獨支。無愧國家柱石。且出塞逐賊。爲收復失地之先聲聨合義軍。併力驅巨寇於三島。行見忠勇英武。南方十九不能專美於前也。雖然。東北空氣。充塞不抵抗主義。而北方十九。又僅一旅之衆耳。以一旅之微。困於惡劣環境。其堅苦實甚於南方十九也。所願何將軍能本粉身碎骨之念。誓灑最後一滴血於山海關。則堅苦不足慮。巨寇不難平。而此同一十九。南方之强歟。北方之强歟。要亦未敢斷言也。</p>
<h3>甘地夫人訪問記（上）</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>伊是一個不知名的婦人</p>
<p>印度亡於英國己久，但甘地的非武力抵抗，却使得我們舉世的人民崇拜，關於甘地的學識和人格，我們早己認識了，不過關於甘地夫人的一切，我們恐怕還没有知道吧？因爲伊是一個不知名的婦人The　Woman　thnt　nobody　knows，這次伊坐了四十五天的監獄，出獄以後，日日新聞的記者克利華H.J.Greenwall便去訪聞甘地夫人，現在爲使讚２者認識這不知名的婦人起見，把克利華訪問後發表的那篇甘地夫人訪問記，譯述在下面：</p>
<p>我去訪問過這位不知名的婦人了，伊便是甘地夫人，伊新從獄中吃滿了第一次的四十五天的官司而出來的。</p>
<p>這的確是一件困難的事情，我們去訪問的時候，一連等了三天，因爲伊齊巧在參與一種會議，世後來伊終於走入了我們守候的那間屋子裏了，那間屋子是平頂的，從實口望去，便是摩剌巴爾山的山麓，那座印度廟恰是和那屋子相對着。</p>
<p>「你在監獄裏覺得怎樣？」這便是我開頭第一句問伊的話，甘地夫人是一個很矮的婦人，伊的身體，恐伯不滿四尺高，把伊那黑邊的衣服刷光後，便答道：</p>
<p>「不很好；的確，」伊帶着微笑，「因爲是甘地的夫人，他們是另眼看待，在犯人中我是」</p>
<p>可算最優待了。」</p>
<p>我們的坐位和星緣的距離很近，天正在很快的黑暗起來，甘地夫人所說的話不多，而且没有一句是英語，所以我們的談話，是完全由人翻譯的。</p>
<p>我們在屋子裏的人數，很快的增加起來，最初發現的是一個戴着眼鏡的少婦，伊把六個月監獄生活的經騐，來打斷我們的談話，後來的是一個年輕的少女，伊來告訴夫人，伊和四個同伴是如何的受警察來干涉自由，最後是一個戴着眼鏡的青年，他的話鑽進了我的左耳朶，他大聲疾呼的說，西北邊境的人們的舉動是如何的殘暴。</p>
<p>甘地夫人赤着脚，在伊每隻瘦小的臂膀上，帶着一雙玻璃的絞鐲。</p>
<p>我知道伊的年齡是五十五歲，但從伊稀少的灰白的頭髮上看去，如果以歐洲人爲標準，那麽至少有六十多歲了。</p>
<p>甘地夫人現在得到了許多的年輕的監獄同伴，伊們都因少繳了鹽稅而犯罪的，據夫人說，這些少女，被警察抛在地上，扯破過衣服被他們虐待得非當苦痛。</p>
<h3>斷指殉葬</h3>
<p>— 芮禹成</p>
<p>邑人陳某。曾在南京高等師範畢業。歷任各中等學校的國文敎師。現充縣立民衆敎育館長。其人富於感情。而對於伉儷尤篤。數年前與同鄉茅女士結婚。家庭很是和洽。兩年以後。茅女士腹中懷孕了。陳某暗自歡喜。因爲這是他們夫婦倆愛情的結晶。不料未過數月。女士忽然流產。并以心裏懊喪。致染病症。陳某晝夜看護。毫無倦容。一方面延請著名的醫生診治。湯藥必親自熬煎。不假僕人之手。深恐發生錯誤。那知女士的病症日漸沈重。弄得諸醫束手。陳某心裏煩悶。但表面上還是鎭靜的伏侍。這樣過了七天。女士竟與世長辭了。臨危之時。用手緊握着陳某的左手。口中己不能言語。直到氣絶的當兒。手仍緊握着不放。家人欲來撥開。陳某堅持不可。敎人拿了一把快刀。便斷去這左手的四個指頭。由他親愛的亡妻握着。一直握到棺材裏。土裏。</p>
<p>這段故事差不多傳徧了故鄉。陳某至今還健在。人都稱他爲「獨指先生。」</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（六一）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第八回　無邊哀怨懺情中難期曠逹　極度聲歌行樂裏得覩威嚴　　梁笑雲聽了這番委婉悽情的說話。無意中瞟了安玉田一眼。見他垂首至臆。心中似有無限的酸楚與慚惶。不由也長嘆了一聲道。這樣說來。我倒不如人家曠逹了。便我自有我的苦處。才不得己而有此舉。事到如今。己擠到這樣。也只好寗我負人。等日後有機會。再找伊表明心迹了。說罷。檢出那張支票。摺疊成個小方勝。夾在纖指縫裏。隨又很無聊的輕輕把它撕掉。由兩片撕成四片。再四片撕爲八片。以至於無數片。順手一抛。這許多紙片兒便如蝴蝶紛飛一樣。飄舞著次第落到屋中鬆軟的地毯上。聽不出半絲的聲息。於是座中這三個人都感覺得有一種莫名的悲哀。冷冰冰的向心靈中襲到。而面面相觑著齊僵在那幽默的境界。魏卓謀耐不了這寂靜。悄悄便欲逃走。安玉田搭訕著要起身相送。至魏卓謀回頭向他扮了個滑稽面孔。又舉起右手來。將大姆指與食指摩觸著碰出微微一聲怪響。他就復頽然坐下。聽其自去。再停了片刻。梁笑雲慢慢將小手帕兒擦拭過眼眶邊潮潤的痕迹。對安玉田遥遞個極不自然的苦笑道。别再想這個疚心的事情了罷。我且把今天替你頭一次出馬辦事的經過。告訴你一點聽聽。如今向官塲運動差事。最妙莫過於走内缐。葉五太太雖和我很不錯。那條路也算找的對。但僅憑賣空面子究還是不行的。所謂世故人情。總還須借重一點相當的禮物做敲　磚。我幸而想起從前我和伊同住在一家班子裏的時節。我有個客人。送了我一個很大的雞心形悲翠戒指。顔色滴綠。毫無瑕疵。雖價錢至高也不過幾千塊錢。却很不易再掏摸著同樣的到手。伊當時見了。就非常心愛的極口稱讚。當時我不能無緣無故的送給伊。恰好留到今天。用得著送禮了。送旁的東西。很難合伊的意。又不便多現痕跡。順便就送上這個。倒非常的合式呢。</p>

<p>此次滬變，我人民損凟失頗重，總得想法來救濟救濟，現擬在上海方面，建設兩條幹路，一由極南而至極北，一由極東而至極西，並擬於某某地，建築一住宅區，使人民住的問題，容易解决，預算建設費約一千萬元，倘若不彀再加五百萬元，</p>

<h3>化學美術小工業</h3>
<p>— 乃徵</p>
<p>我們看見玻璃上有像雕刻的文字畫案，非常美麗，這種大槪都是日貨，他們不是用刀來雕刻的，因爲玻璃很硬，不容易下刀·他們是用化學的方法來雕刻，手續簡單，所用藥品的價錢又很便宜，可惜我國還没有這種小工業，實在因爲不曉得的人很多·所以現在我介紹出來，提倡提倡。</p>
<p>（一）簡便雕刻法</p>
<p>先在玻璃片上，塗滿蜜蠟（Ｗax　Bee），用小刀或針，隨意刻去所塗的蠟，寫字或畫圖。於是拿一只大口鉛質瓶，（用輕鉛製，别種器具不可用，否則要熔裂的，）裏面放十五分氟化鈣（Ｃalciumfluride），十九分硫酸（ＳulphuricAcid）置在三脚鐵架上，下面用酒精燈加熱，就可以拿刻好的玻璃片，擱在鉛瓶口上熏，同時拿冷水布覆在玻璃片背後，防蠟溶蝕，經過七八分鐘，在没有蠟的玻璃紋上，現出銀白色來，然後拿下來用刀刮脫蠟，再放在熱水中洗後，就有文字或畫案出現了。所要雕刻的深淺，與熏的時間成正比例。</p>
<p>（二）精細雕刻法</p>
<p>拿氟化鈣與硫酸（數量同上一法）置在輕鉛製的曲頸瓶中，瓶口塞一個有孔的橡皮塞，再拿一只空鉛瓶，亦拿有孔橡皮塞塞緊口，然後把一根橡皮管的兩頭塞在兩個橡皮塞孔内，使兩只瓶連通。而後拿空鉛瓶放在冰桶内（冰中加食鹽），再拿曲頸鉛瓶置在火酒燈上燒熱。裏面二物即融化成氣體，從橡皮管通到空瓶裏，受冷凝結成液汁，待氣化完，都變成液汁，就拿一個無孔橡皮塞塞好，安置於陰濕的地方。再拿玻璃片像上面一法塗蠟刻紋完畢，拿橡皮筆（像皮削成筆狀）蘸這種液汁，塗在刻去蠟的玻璃上。經半小時後，用温水洗去即成。用此法製成的花紋較前一法顯明而精細，但是手續稍爲煩一些。</p>
<p>再有量杯外面的條紋格子，也是用上面的法子製成；倘使要製毛玻璃（攝影機上用）可以拿玻璃片一面塗滿蜜蠟，浸入製成的液汁中，用竹筷迅速拿出，（切不可用手），放在清水中冲洗過即成。</p>
<p>按玻璃上刻書畫的方法，前月業己載過一文，惟與此篇方法略有不同，且並無精細刻法，爰重錄之，</p>
<p>何好意</p>
<h3>不好意思</h3>
<p>— 力出</p>
<p>在一個星期的下午，走進××書局去選買幾本應用的書籍，恰巧這星期日，顧客特别的多，尤其是這家書局丨有幾位摩登女店員的丨爲最盛，這些顾客，川流不息戸限爲穿，看他們面部的表現好像是因有幾位女店員而光臨的，做生意的人，眞善於適應顧客們的心理，在這社交公開的時期，男女界線，早經打破，利用這個機會？一則可以擴張生意，再則可以帮助女子的生產力，兩全其美，正值得這樣做去，</p>
<p>我跨進店堂裏，看見眞實買書的人也有，而東張西望並不買的也有，那男女的店員們，也不見得十分忙碌，有一面櫃台外旁，站着一位女顧客，年齡約模二十歲的光景，櫃臺裏面，有兩位女店員，與她的年紀不相上下，那位女顧客，尋找了多時，才得着了一本她所要看的戀愛的情書，便用和藹的態度低聲的問一位女店員，「這本書丵對於戀愛的事情怎樣？」這一位長而秀的女店員，含笑着而未及答，那另一位肥而碩的女店員搶着說，「很好！很好！可以買一本做參考參考！」那曉得即觸怒了那先笑而不答的女店員，高聲的喊道，「啊！你看過，你知道，你對於戀愛是有經騐的人，」這樣一說，在店内的一般人們，都回頭望着她們笑，還有幾位没有聽清爽的，在那低聲說，「什麽事，她們莫非是情敵在吃醋吧？」她們見着大家的神氣都注意她們，很感覺羞愧，鵝蛋色襯出桃紅的臉兒，忽然赤過兩耳了，現出很不好意思的樣子，</p>
<p>社会的一角</p>
<h3>三部曲</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>提畔的桃雲深處，春之朝陽綿密地緊擁着這一對人兒。她和他在低聲細語：</p>
<p>「薲妹！啊！你！當我第一次拜識」</p>
<p>你的時候，我便决心將生命中的一切完全獻給你！」</p>
<p>「呀！是的。我謹接受你的好意·我願在這世界裏只有我能同情你！只讓我一個人來…愛你！」</p>
<p>「啊！這使我沉醉，使我沉醉，我簡直不能再等待那還未到來的婚禮。…你呢？」</p>
<p>「我？…我也願意……。」</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>牀畔的抬燈暗處，秋之夜雨凄清地滴落在妻的心頭。妻和夫在低聲細語：「親愛的，你爲什麽回來得這樣晚啊？」</p>
<p>「自然是有事囉！」</p>
<p>「你不會想到我在等着你麽？」</p>
<p>「但你也該知道我自有事忙。」</p>
<p>「哎！可憐我的病啊，……」</p>
<p>「唯有你的病才有這未多。」</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>簷畔的雪花密處，冬之北風怒吼地震頣着這年輕的父母。她和他在低聲細晤：</p>
<p>「這孩子眞是麻煩啊，老是哭。」</p>
<p>「耐煩一點罷，看在我們愛情的面上！我的丈夫。」</p>
<p>「愛情嗎？早己死了！哼！」</p>
<p>「……那末，……我的苦……」</p>
<p>「媽的！閙什麽呀？你這醜婦！」</p>
<p>「那末乾脆離婚罷，我想一定比現在這樣地舒服。」</p>
<h3>生夢</h3>
<h3>玉清宫裏一瞥</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>啊！這是玉清宫，當我才步入時發現在圓洞的上面很明顯的標示着，</p>
<p>那威嚴的神像的前面，豎立着高大的燭架與香鼎，牠的上面和内中滿缀了點點的火紅和盈握的香條，燭與香的烟霧在結合着嬝嬝地上升，因着火與烟的浸禮，使亨受的神像失落了他的原有的色澤，同時，殿中的其他，也都因着福澤所庇在同等的享受，</p>
<p>「阿要請幾股香燭？」殿落中的香燭販不時的用他那和靄的口調及含有笑意的面容在向來往的男女，尤其是老太婆詢問着，</p>
<p>「五股香，五對燭，」那懸掛着黃布袋的信士很豪爽的購買，她們膜拜着，默祈着，把手中燒熾的香零星的分插在諸神的鼎内，並且其他的偏殿，也一律的使他們安享這同等的待遇，</p>
<p>「嘩啦，嘩啦啦，」銅板很自然的由她們的手中飛到那立在佛旁桌側久受薰陶的圓竹筒裏，</p>
<p>「善心的太太，發財的………」一個受過鍜鍊的乞丐，也擠了進來，在這信女的背後求祈着，希冀能獲得些理想中的安慰，</p>
<p>「走開，嘸没，」</p>
<p>「啊！慈悲的……不在乎此……」他繼續的尾隨和懇禱，</p>
<p>「那是佛喲！你……」很輕巧而自然的由那個正在向另外一殿邁進曾經購香的中年信女的口中宣洩出來，</p>
<p>啊！他大槪是在吁嘆着自己没有做佛，不能妄想這誠摯的供奉吧？她的背影迷失在烟中了，他仍向那烟霧迷漫中張望，</p>
<p>彬　　尾</p>
<h3>一個可憐的黃包車夫</h3>
<p>— 熹</p>
<p>「今天出來己經半天了，一個子兒還没有拉着，回去吃甚麽？」一個年約四十歲的車夫，拉着一輛笨重的車，在馬路上慢慢地走着，懊喪着對自己這樣的說，</p>
<p>剛巧對面走出一個穿西裝的闊先生，車夫暗想道，救星到了，趕快的拉車子去迎接，</p>
<p>「先生！到那兒？我拉您去！」車夫這樣的問着，巴不得那闊先生立刻就上他的車，</p>
<p>「天蟾舞台多少子兒？」闊先生問，「拉去！您給我三十個子兒就是了，」車夫答，</p>
<p>「二十個子兒，去不去？」闊先生問，</p>
<p>「乾脆點，您給我二十三個子兒罷」，車夫答，</p>
<p>「多一個也不要，不去就拉倒，」闊先生一面說，一面向前走着，</p>
<p>「多一個子兒，您算得甚麽？」車夫懇求的說着，</p>
<p>闊先生一聲不理，便大踏步的向前走去了，</p>
<p>「這樣的闊先生，多三個子兒都不願意，眞是……」車夫自己說，</p>
<p>「先生！站着，我拉二十個子兒罷」，因爲他想到今天一個子兒還没有拉着，所以就呌那闊先生，拉車跟上去，他剛到時，對面也來了一個車，</p>
<p>「天蟾舞台，二十個子兒，去不去？」闊先生問那個車夫，</p>
<p>「拉去！」那個車夫答，</p>
<p>「先生是我先講好的，」這個車夫望着闊先生說，</p>
<p>「你不去嗎？」闊先生怒聲的說，他坐在那個車上，那個車夫飛也似的拉着跑去了，這個車夫望那車不見了，便放下他的車，垂頭下去，默不作聲，一會兒，眼圈發紅，熱涙流出來了，</p>

<h3>「看香頭」的效果</h3>
<p>警愚</p>
<p>自從鄰居李府老太太病重以后，她的女兒「蓉」便急得像熱鍋上螞蟻般的團團旋轉，</p>
<p>「喂！小姐！我看還是請「看香頭」的「雙仙人」來看看香頭，倒很有意思呢！」這是張府的女傭胡媽，對着「蓉」的建議，</p>
<p>「怎樣呌做「雙仙人？」「看香頭」又是什麽一回事！」「蓉」很詫民異似的向她窮問，</p>
<p>「喏！「看香頭」就是「雙仙人」的一種業務，「雙仙人」是天生着兩個眼瞳人的，所以能夠看得見陰空的一切，祗須點了香燭，虔誠禱祝，目注香頭，神妖鬼怪的形像，就此畢現，因而判斷人家的休咎，這是最準不過的，現在×地的×仙人，也是「雙仙人，」它的「看香頭，」靈騐非凡，遠近很有名氣，怎不請來試試看喲？」她絮絮地述明「雙仙人」的效用，和「看香頭的好處，並且稱讚×仙人的能爲，極力地推薦，</p>
<p>「啊！當眞嗎？那是好極了，我正在急得無法可想，你就去给我請來罷！」「蓉」喜不自勝，巴不得立刻呌她實行，明天的午后，×仙人果然如約光臨了，所有焚香燃燭等排塲，一切俱備，而「蓉」亦必恭必敬，盈盈地跪禱起來，「你家上代有個冤鬼，在此纒擾，這是非請「道士」捉拿不可的，此外還觸犯了「鄷都大帝」「北陰喪司」和「滕蛇」「五聖」……諸神，都要盛設牲醴，隆禮祈禳，至少須謝菩薩三十六桌，照此做去，包管病人馬上轉機，三天就好，×仙人據其香頭上觀察所得，逐一指示明白，「蓉」則如奉綸音敬謹祇遵，</p>
<p>到了晚上，「道士」「太保」丨此輩盛行於浦南一帶，專謝菩薩，丨源源而來，實行其「打醮」「謝菩薩」的工作，於是鑼鼓喧天，李府中異常熱閙，而所費亦即不資，</p>
<p>等到「道士」「太保」事畢散塲，老太太也嗚呼哀哉，壽終正寢，</p>

<h3>The Future of the New Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>Since Prime Minister Inukai was assassinated, we have asserted that Japan would inevitably form a supra-party cabinet. Now, Saito has been appointed to succeed as the prime minister. The formation of a supra-party cabinet is a foregone conclusion. Our words have been verified. Because the situation has reached a point where there is no other way than to replace the political party cabinet with a supra-party cabinet.</p>
<p>After Inukai's assassination, the most talked-about figures to succeed him were Hiranuma, the leader of the Kokuhonsha, and Suzuki, the new president of the Seiyukai. However, it was difficult to predict who would ultimately win. When Saionji went to the capital to assess the situation, he felt compelled to follow the military's opinion and organize a supra-party cabinet, but he also dared not cause embarrassment to the political parties. He resolutely abandoned Hiranuma and Suzuki, who were at the center of the political storm. Saito was thus able to receive the imperial order. However, Saito, acting as a buffer, is gathering in the midst of the tide. It will be extremely difficult to cope with this difficult situation and win the favor of all parties. Therefore, the selection of cabinet members for the new cabinet was quite hesitant. It is natural that it was a difficult birth.</p>
<p>However, the establishment of the new cabinet will eventually become a reality within days. We don't need to spend time speculating. What we should pay attention to now is what its future will be after the new cabinet is produced, and what its impact on the world will be.</p>
<p>We believe that Saito's cabinet formation is more due to the victory of the military's advocacy than to Saionji's recommendation. We have said many times before that the Japanese fascist movement has reached its peak. The reason for the rise of fascist forces is actually due to the economic depression and the increasing severity of the recession, which stimulated the intensification of the left-leaning movement. Under this tide of economic panic, all social contradictions and crises are bound to erupt at any opportunity. The political party cabinet has no way to curb this crisis and stabilize politics, and the supra-party cabinet may not have this possibility. Even if a purely military cabinet is realized and fascism is vigorously implemented to suppress reaction, it will not be able to stop the tide of the times. Therefore, Saito's cabinet, under the impact of the current era, is only a bridge in a transitional era. We are very doubtful about whether its future will be bright and whether it will have a long and lasting political life.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Saito Cabinet, it will definitely take the will of the military as its will. In other words, it will definitely vigorously implement militarism, intensify preparations for war against the United States and the Soviet Union externally, implement a tough policy toward us, and vigorously implement fascist politics internally to suppress the left-leaning movement, which will stimulate the increasing intensification of the left-leaning movement. The Osaka Asahi Shimbun published an article by Otake Hakuyoshi on the 13th, fearing that the Soviet Union would disrupt the situation in the event of a Japanese-American war and make Japan Sovietized. Therefore, he advocated easing relations with the Soviet Union. However, once a Japanese-American war breaks out, the world will immediately be engulfed in a vortex. Can Japan really avoid sudden changes during the war? In short, Japan's politics are now like a horse freed from its reins, galloping away and uncontrollable. Its future is certainly not optimistic.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, Zhenru and Zhabei Were Taken Over</h3>
<p>Today, Yanghang and Shizilin Will Be Taken Over</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Baoshan and Wusong Will Be Taken Over</p>
<p>Three hundred soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 9th Regiment, 9th Division of the Japanese Army in Zhenhua, completely withdrew at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. They were taken over by Shi Jinzhang, director of the 3rd Sub-District of the 4th District of our Municipal Public Security Bureau, and 72 police officers were dispatched to maintain order. The Japanese Naval Landing Forces in the jurisdiction of the 5th District, 2nd Sub-District, 4th District, etc., east of Zhongshan Road in Zhabei, west of Songhu Road, and north of Jinghu Road, also completely withdrew at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Huang Ming, director of the Zhabei Office of the Public Security Bureau, took over. Local security was also maintained by plainclothes police officers on guard. Zhabei, which had been occupied for a long time, began to see the light of day again from yesterday afternoon. However, after the disaster, everything is waiting to be rebuilt, and it will take a long time to restore the original state. The details of the takeover are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Zhenru Was Taken Over in the Morning</h3>
<p>Departure of Takeover Personnel: Yesterday, the personnel who went to Zhenru to take over included: Tao Xiaojie, Liang Fuchu, and Cha Nanqiang from the committee; Gong Xikui, Shi Jinzhang, Yin Tixin, Cheng Jinxin, and Wu Qing from the Public Security Bureau; Hong Lanxiang, member of the municipal government; Ma Chonggan and Zhong Shijie from the Education Bureau; Sun Kairen and Zhuge Xun from the Public Works Bureau; Zhou Zanbang from the Public Works Bureau; Jiang Shicheng from the Health Bureau; Yu Ruilin, station manager of Zhenru Station; In addition, the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Jinan University, the Beijing-Hankou Power Line Bureau, the Telephone Bureau, and the China Business Electric Steam Company all sent personnel to participate in the takeover. At 8:00 a.m., they gathered at the Takeover Committee and departed for Zhenru together.</p>
<h3>Arrangements Were Made Separately in Advance</h3>
<p>Arriving in Zhenru at 8:30 a.m., they first went to the Japanese Army Headquarters at Xinmu Bridge to meet the captain, Inoue Sanichi. After the meeting, the Joint Committee, representatives from various countries, and Tao Xiaojie, the special envoy of the Takeover Committee, stayed at the headquarters for negotiations. The takeover personnel from various agencies rushed to the Municipal Committee of Zhenshang to rest temporarily and arrange their positions and the steps of the takeover. Then, the Japanese side sent Deputy Adjutant Yamakawa Yoshiharu to inform our takeover personnel that they could first go to various places to make preliminary arrangements. So, twenty police officers were dispatched to advance to the vicinity of Xinmu Bridge at 9:40 a.m., and after the Japanese army withdrew, they would be deployed in the town. The remaining personnel from various agencies also went to make arrangements.</p>
<h3>Formal Handover Procedures</h3>
<p>Then, at around 10:00 a.m., the handover procedures began. At that time, in addition to our takeover personnel and representatives from various countries, the Japanese side included Captain Inoue Sanichi, Deputy Adjutant Yamakawa Yoshiharu, and translator Kojima Seiichi. First, British Military Officer Brand showed the map, and Director Wen Yingsing and Japanese Military Officer Harada checked it. Then, the handover document was issued, and the handover personnel from both sides signed it. Our side was Shi Jinzhang, Director of the 3rd Sub-District of the 4th District, and the Japanese side was Captain Inoue Sanichi.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Documents Between China and Japan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange of documents between China and Japan was completely different from the withdrawal of Japanese troops in other areas. The original text of the exchange of documents between China and Japan is recorded below. The original Japanese text reads: (1) All the houses and furniture used by the Japanese army have been completely handed over without any remainder. (2) At 11:00 a.m. on May 22, Showa 7, the security of Zhenru and the Zhenru Town and Zhenru Station area has indeed been handed over to your side. (3) We are not responsible for any accidents that occur after the withdrawal of the Japanese army. May 23, Showa 7, Inoue Sanichi, Captain of the Zhenru District Garrison, Infantry Major. Our original text reads: (1) The houses near Zhenru Town and Zhenru Railway Station where the Japanese army was stationed and the furniture in the houses have been accurately received without error. (2) At 11:00 a.m. on May 23, Showa 7, the security of Zhenru Town and Zhenru Railway Station area was indeed taken over by the Japanese army. (3) From now on, the security of this place will be maintained by our side. It goes without saying that the responsibility for any accidents that occur after the withdrawal of the Japanese army does not lie with our army. May 23, 21st year of the Republic of China, Shi Jinzhang, Zhenru Takeover Commissioner, Director of the 3rd Sub-District of the 4th District of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. (Reporter's note: The above exchange of documents was drafted by the Japanese side in advance.)</p>
<h3>The Beiping Security Team Arrived</h3>
<p>The seventy-two members of the Beiping Security Team who opened to Zhenru yesterday were originally stationed on Menggu Road in Zhabei. Yesterday, due to the takeover of Zhenru, they were led by Chief Instructor Ma Hongru and Patrol Officer Zhang Shengfu of the 3rd Sub-District of the 4th District, and departed from Zhabei at 9:00 a.m., passing through Caojiadu, Zhongshan Road, and arriving in Zhenru. It was 10:00 a.m. Then, they were notified by Hong Lanxiang, Tao Xiaojie, etc. to go to the town to set up posts. Another twenty people were deployed in the vicinity of Jinghu Road. However, from today onwards, the security of Zhenru will still be maintained by the police of the 3rd Sub-District of the 4th District. The Beiping Security Team will be transferred back to Zhabei.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Japanese Army's Withdrawal</h3>
<p>The three hundred soldiers of the 1st Battalion of the 9th Division finally left in the Zhenru area. Except for the fifteen people stationed at No. 47 South Main Street in the town, the rest were stationed near Zhenru Station. The Japanese army south of the railway completed the preparation of guns and horses at around 9:00 a.m. The baggage and food were first transported back to the town by more than ten trucks. The fifteen people moved to Jinan training ground at 9:40 a.m. The soldiers and sentries stationed in other houses also gathered at Jinan training ground one after another at 10:20 a.m. At 10:30 a.m., Inoue gave a speech and reviewed the troops at the field for half an hour. At 11:05 a.m., they marched in formation towards Zhongxing Road and withdrew.</p>
<h3>Post-War Matters in Zhenru</h3>
<p>During the battle, Zhenru Town was in the rear, so the destruction of houses was not very serious. However, after the Japanese army entered, the loss of residents' property was very great. Just the residence of Mr. Chen Depei, occupied by the 1st Battalion of the Japanese Army, the antiques and ancient paintings were all taken away, and the loss reached more than 9,000 yuan. The rest can be imagined. In addition, the school supplies and furniture of Jinan University were looted by the Japanese army, and a part of them was seized by the maintenance association of the puppet organization. Yesterday, the representative of the school, Yang Yufen, asked Shi Jinzhang, the director of the 3rd Sub-District of the 4th District, to conduct a thorough investigation of each household to return a part of it. As for Shen Songge, the so-called chairman of the Zhenru Local Maintenance Association of the puppet organization, he has disappeared yesterday.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Was Taken Over in the Afternoon Takeover Procedures in Zhabei</h3>
<p>At 2:30 p.m. yesterday, our takeover personnel officially took over the area north of the Zhabei Railway. The handover ceremony was held at the headquarters of the 3rd Battalion of the Japanese Army in Anhui Middle School on Zhongxing Road. The Japanese Navy authorities also stipulated the following procedures for the second takeover of Zhabei: (1) Chinese Committee members in attendance, (2) Japanese Committee members seated, (3) Handshake between Commander Mori and Commander Huang Ming, (4) Commander Mori's handover</p>

<h3>Departure of Takeover Personnel</h3>
<p>The Takeover Committee appointed special envoys Cha Nanqiang, Tao Xiaojie, and Li Shengjun to be responsible for the handover. After completing the handover in Zhenru at 11:30 a.m. yesterday, the special envoys went directly to Zhabei to negotiate the handover with the Japanese side. Huang Ming, Long Xikui, Yin Tixin, He Yiming, and Niu Jingjian from the Public Security Bureau; Gu Xianbai from the Public Works Bureau; Zhong Shijie from the Education Bureau; He Bingsong from the Commercial Press; and Zeng Zhihong from the Two-Road Bureau gathered at Jiangping Nursery on Yuyingtang Road at 1:30 p.m. At 1:40 p.m., they departed together to the headquarters of the 2nd Battalion of the Japanese Navy to hold the takeover ceremony.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Handover Between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>At 1:45 p.m., the committee members from China, Britain, the United States, Italy, and other countries of the Joint Committee came to the headquarters of the 3rd Battalion of the Japanese Navy in Anhui Middle School to monitor the withdrawal of the Japanese army. After the committee members of the Joint Committee arrived at the scene, they successively studied the map and carefully verified the withdrawal points of the Japanese army. At that time, the Japanese army was gathered in the courtyard of Anhui Middle School. At 2:10 p.m., the handover ceremony was held. Mori Kakuyoshi, Commander of the 1st Battalion of the Japanese Navy, and Huang Ming, Commander of our Police Battalion, took their positions. First, Japanese Commander Mori Kakuyoshi gave a speech, saying that China and Japan were unfortunately enemies, and today, a truce and troop withdrawal have been realized and a satisfactory solution has been reached, which he feels very happy about. In this war, both China and Japan sacrificed many precious lives, which he feels very painful about. Looking back on the past, he feels even more regret. Since the Japanese Navy entered Zhabei, there have been few Japanese residents in Zhabei and many Chinese residents. However, the Japanese army has prevented security and treated everyone equally, so that the people can live and work in peace. Fortunately, there has been nothing wrong for more than a month. Now that local security is handed over to the Chinese side, he hopes that the Chinese police can maintain security as usual, restore order, and do their best to protect Japanese residents, so that Zhabei, where the Japanese army has been stationed, will become a model area in Shanghai in the future, which he hopes for. After Commander Nichida finished speaking, Commander Huang Ming of our side gave a speech, saying that in this Sino-Japanese war, the two countries were unhappy. Now that a truce and troop withdrawal have been achieved, he will protect the local area as much as possible, regardless of class or nationality, and do his best to maintain it. After the speech, Commander Nichida and Commander Huang Ming shook hands and decided to carry out the document exchange procedures.</p>
<h3>The Original Text of the Handover Document</h3>
<p>(1) No abnormality in the security maintenance and guard area, (2) (Area) West of Hongkou, north of Huning Railway, south of Yinying Road, (3) (Occupied buildings) The occupied state is preserved, middle school (that is, Anhui Middle School) Jinglu Temple, (4) (Occupied movable property) Separate line pass (that is, the meaning of another attached book) (5) (Criminals) None</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Retreated in Formation</h3>
<p>The Japanese Navy stationed in Zhabei has a total of 13 two battalions. The commander of the first battalion is Mori Kakukyu, and the commander of the third battalion is Oeyan. Yesterday, after the document exchange procedures were completed, at 2:30 p.m., all the Japanese troops began to withdraw, walking east along Zhongxing Road to Zhongxing Road to gather with the first battalion, and then walking east along Dongxing Road to Jiangwan Road into the Hongkou Japanese area. The Japanese troops were well-equipped, and there were two armored vehicles to protect the rear when they withdrew.</p>
<h3>Pingjing Takes Over Zhabei</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the two battalions of Pingjing, totaling more than 200, were responsible for taking over Zhabei. At 1:40 p.m., they were stationed at Jiangping Nursery on Gonghe Xin Road and Yuyingtang Road. After the Japanese army withdrew, the police team was stationed in each area to take over. Yesterday, when the Pingjing went to take over the defense, the chief commander Lu Lu also went to arrange it. The area was originally under the jurisdiction of the 5th District General Office and the 2nd Sub-District of the 5th District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. From yesterday, it has resumed office. The 5th District General Office is temporarily located at Shen's residence, No. 537 Hongxing Road, the headquarters address of the army's first battalion. The 2nd Office of the 5th District is temporarily stationed at Jiangping Nursery on Yuyingtang Road.</p>
<h3>Joint Committee Inspects</h3>
<p>The Joint Committee, Sang Hai'er, Brand, Faratini, Wen Yingsing, Harada Kumakichi, etc., after the takeover was completed, took cars to inspect the junction where the Japanese army temporarily stationed after the withdrawal of the Japanese army from Yokohama River. They were afraid that the Japanese army and our police would misunderstand each other across the river in the future, and inspected the post-war situation there. A group of six people exited Anhui Middle School, entered Gonghe Xin Road, Hutai Road, Zhongshan Road, Sanyang Road, Gujiawan, and Yokohama River along Zhongxing Road, a distance of more than a hundred weapons, that is, the Eight Character Bridge, which was the most intense place recorded in the war where the two armies faced each other for more than a month. There were almost no complete houses within dozens of miles around. Along the way, broken walls, rubble, scorched earth, and debris were piled up like mounds. The factory buildings, chimneys, etc. that had not been bombed or burned out were also mostly penetrated by cannonballs, like opening doors and households, and the holes in the bullets were even denser than beehives. After inspecting, the committee members went to the nearby Japanese crematorium and cemetery to inspect, and then took the cars and turned back, crossing the Songhu Railway from Xinmin Road, Tongji Road, and Jiangwan Road, and entered the concession from North Sichuan Road and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Taking Over Zhenru and Zhabei Schools</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Zhenru area was taken over, including Jinan University, Southeast Medical College, and nine municipal primary schools, including Zhenru, Guanlong, Pengcheng, Gucun, Changtou, Xincun, Yanlong, Luku, and Ganlu. In the afternoon, the Zhabei area was taken over, including 26 private schools, such as Shibei, and 6 municipal primary schools, such as Peiben. The Municipal Education Bureau sent Ma Chonggan, Zhong Shijie, Zhang Yanggao, Zhou Shang, Zhu Chenggui, Li Haihong, Zhang Meisun, Yao Changjiong, etc., accompanied by the responsible personnel of each school, to take over and inspect. It was found that Guangdong, Shanggong, Shibei, Daozhong, Yude, Huifeng, Jiancheng, Xinming, Jianguo, Zhabei Kindergarten, Peiben, and other 26 schools in Zhabei were completely burned down on the fire line. China Women's Physical School and Pengnan Primary School only had empty school buildings left, and the items were looted. The losses in Zhenru schools were relatively small. Jinan and Southeast Medical College were bombed in many places, and the school equipment was lost, resulting in huge losses.</p>
<h3>Yanghang and Shizilin Will Be Taken Over Today</h3>
<p>The Japanese troops in the north of Zhenru and Zhabei withdrew separately yesterday morning and afternoon, and were taken over by our side. The Japanese troops in Yanghang and Shizilin Fortress will also withdraw at the same time at 11:00 a.m. this morning. A squadron of the Capital Security Team, which was taken over by our side, has been transferred to Yuepu by Captain Bian, and will go to take over at 11:00 a.m. today, together with Wang Qingtao, the district chief of the first district of Baoshan County, and Shi Ze, the takeover commissioner of the takeover committee.</p>
<h3>Baoshan and Wusong Will Be Taken Over Tomorrow Departing for Inspection Today</h3>
<p>The Japanese troops in Baoshan and Wusong have decided to withdraw tomorrow. The Takeover Committee decided to send personnel to inspect and negotiate the takeover of Wusong, and designated Yin Tixin, Li Jing, Tao Xiaojie, and Tang Chengzong to negotiate everything with the Japanese side. They will gather at the association at 7:10 a.m. this morning and must depart at 8:00 a.m.</p>
<h3>Police Dispatched to Handle the Takeover</h3>
<p>The Takeover Committee also ordered Sun Xiwu, the county magistrate of Baoshan County, to order 30 to 50 provincial police officers to arrive outside Baoshan City before 9:00 a.m. tomorrow to handle the takeover with the Capital Security Team.</p>
<h3>Jiangwan Police Replaced</h3>
<p>The Takeover Committee also ordered Bian Zhishan, the commander of the Capital Security Team, to order a squadron of police officers currently stationed in Jiangwan to arrive outside Baoshan County before 9:00 a.m. tomorrow to handle the takeover with Sun Xiwu, the county magistrate of Baoshan County. The defense of Jiangwan Town will be handed over to Dai Hongen, the director of the 5th Sub-District of the 5th District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who will lead the Beiping Security Team to take over.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of Pengpu After the Takeover</h3>
<p>Since Pengpu Town was taken over by our side on the 19th of this month, there has been a squad of the Capital Security Police, totaling more than 30 people, stationed there. The leaders of the defense regiment, Hou Qizhang, Zhou Buli, Shangguan Rong, Zhao Zuyan, and Wang Yingxiang, personally lead their departments to patrol day and night. Therefore, the town and its vicinity have been peaceful as usual in recent days. The reporter of Xinsheng News Agency met Ling Zhibin, the municipal committee member of the district yesterday, who said that the municipal office of the district has been operating as usual since the 19th, and Pengpu Primary School also started classes on the 20th. In terms of transportation, since Zhabei has been taken over by our side, there have been no traces of the Japanese army between Shanghai and Pengpu since yesterday afternoon. Yu (Ling Jun himself) personally visited the entire area between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. today (the 23rd), east to Yemaowan, north to Dachang Town, west to Dayang Bridge and Wangjiajing, and south to Zhongbei Road, Qiujiang Road, Yongxing Road, and Zhijiangmiao Road, transportation is convenient, and there are police posts everywhere. The new Yingpan branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau also resumed operation at 4:00 p.m. today, and Chen Xuemin is still the patrol officer. The 2nd team of the Zhongxing Road Pengpu Defense Regiment also resumed posting at 3:00 p.m. today. Most of the shops in the district have also opened for business. Therefore, please ask your reporter to publish the peaceful situation in detail, hoping that the people who have not returned to their hometown will move back immediately. The reporter also asked about the serious disaster situation in your district as reported in the newspapers, and how to provide relief in the future. He replied that the houses in the district, such as Yongxing Road and Qiujiang Road, were all burned down. The relief method here is planned to be handled in the same way as in Zhabei. As for the rural farm households, in addition to distributing tens of thousands of pounds of cotton seeds three weeks ago, they are now contacting the four districts of Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinhang, and Zhenru to prepare a relief plan, such as providing loans, clothing, medical treatment, disaster relief, and organizing small industries, and jointly submitting it to the Municipal Government for separate implementation.</p>
<h3>The Status of the Postal Workers' Strike on the Second Day</h3>
<p>Airmail Efforts to Deliver</p>
<p>Preparing for an International Temporary Post Office</p>
<p>Huang Naishu Took Office Yesterday</p>
<p>The General Labor Union is Conducting Mediation</p>
<p>The general strike of postal workers in the city entered its second day yesterday. Although Mayor Wu and others made every effort to mediate, there was no progress. In order to rescue international postal delivery, the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession consulted with the municipal government and the French Concession authorities yesterday morning to discuss countermeasures, and decided to set up a temporary post office to send and receive international mail. Huang Naishu, the new director of the Post Office, took office yesterday morning. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Airmail Delivery as Usual</h3>
<p>Since China Aviation Corporation announced that it would continue to collect and deliver airmail as usual, the number of people who came to the company to send airmail yesterday was very crowded, and the company's staff also worked overtime due to the work of checking and sorting letters. In order to protect the safety of the staff, the company has negotiated with the police station to send more police officers to the office for protection. The Longhua Aircraft Factory has also dispatched 40 police and security team members from the Public Security Bureau to protect it permanently. All the airmail from various places that arrived in Shanghai the day before was also delivered by dozens of Boy Scouts hired by the company. Yesterday afternoon, all of them were delivered. When the Boy Scouts were delivering letters, the company also asked the police station and the Public Security Bureau to order the police officers on duty to pay attention to protection. Therefore, the Boy Scouts' service was very safe. The recipients and the public were grateful and admired the energetic Boy Scouts who were delivering letters.</p>
<h3>Opening a Temporary Post Office</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau decided to open a temporary emergency post office dedicated to receiving and sending international mail due to the strike at the Shanghai Post Office. It will begin operations at 9:30 a.m. this morning. The address is located on the third floor of the Public Works Bureau on Fuzhou Road. Feeson, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Merihac, French Consul-General, and Zaplin, Director of the Shanghai Post Office, met at the Public Works Bureau at 11:00 a.m. yesterday morning to discuss the matter and decided to handle it. At the beginning of the opening, only letters to Hong Kong and foreign countries will be accepted. The method of postage is to issue a kind of letter coupon, each five coupons are sold for one yuan, and each letter is affixed with one coupon. If you want to register, you need to add two more letter coupons. The Public Works Bureau has now assigned a number of temporary staff, but it is afraid that it will not be enough, and it is still recruiting volunteers to serve as letter pickers or other positions. If you have anything to contact with this post office, you can write to Mr. Lan, the director of the Public Works Bureau. This post office is completely temporary and emergency in nature, because the work of the Chinese Post Office is currently suspended.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Allowed to Collect and Send</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening Post said that the reporter of this newspaper inquired about various shipping companies this (23rd) morning, and most of them are also willing to receive letters and postcards to facilitate the public. However, registered letters are not accepted. All letters with sufficient postage affixed by the sender can be received by Changxing Dalai Consulting Company and sent to various export ships. And various wheel bill rooms can also receive this kind of letter and sell stamps. The companies such as Beide and Henry are not convenient to receive mail in the company, only the ships can receive it, but they must affix sufficient German postage. The Japan Mail Ship Company can also receive letters with sufficient Chinese postage affixed, and its ships can also receive letters.</p>
<h3>Accommodation Measures for Deposit Withdrawals</h3>
<p>After the postal workers' strike, regarding postal savings and remittances, in addition to the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau at No. 5 Fuzhou Road and the National Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, which continue to operate as usual, the remaining branches are closed because they have always been handled by postal workers. Yesterday, the reporter visited the manager of the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. According to the manager, after the postal workers' strike, the savings and remittance branches in this port were temporarily suspended because they were previously handled by the post office. Now, the branch deposit households have decided on the following accommodation measures: (1) The branch deposit households who have a passbook for accommodation savings can withdraw deposits from the head office at No. 5 Fuzhou Road. (2) Non-accommodation savings in each branch, because the head office does not have the seal of the deposit household, are difficult to handle and must be temporarily suspended. In case the strike extends gradually, a new method will be found to accommodate non-accommodation savings. As for the staff in the head office who joined the postal workers' union, there are only fifteen people, although they are also on strike, but it has no impact.</p>
<h3>Huang Nai-shu Assumes Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation, suspecting Qian Chunqi, the Director-General of the Postal Administration, of inciting the recent postal workers' strike, detained him in the capital a few days ago. He is currently being held at the Garrison Headquarters. Huang Nai-shu has been appointed to replace him as Director-General of the Postal Administration. After receiving the appointment, Mr. Huang arrived at the office yesterday morning (the 23rd) at 10 a.m. to take charge. Lin Shi, the representative of the Ministry of Transportation, delivered a speech. Those who attended the inauguration ceremony yesterday included Lin Shi, the representative of the Ministry of Transportation, Zhong Shigang, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Transportation, Yang Jianping, the Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Liu Peiquan, the General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation, and over fifty staff members of the Postal Administration. At 10:20 a.m., Mr. Huang arrived with officials from the Ministry of Transportation, and the inauguration ceremony immediately began. Lin Shi delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Yang Jianping. Finally, Mr. Huang gave a response. After the ceremony, everyone dispersed.</p>
<h3>Expression of the Strike Committee</h3>
<p>The Strike Committee sent representatives Zhang Kechang, Qi Jiamou, Chuan Dewei, and Shi Yitang, among others, to meet with Mayor Wu at the City Hall on the afternoon before last. After the meeting, they reported the details back to the Strike Committee. The committee, after hearing the report, immediately convened a plenary meeting and seriously considered the situation. They believe that the proposed plan to consolidate the postal foundation is of great importance to the future of the postal service, so they are willing to take the final action to achieve it. During this critical period, they sincerely hope that the Ministry of Transportation will openly accept the proposal so that it can be resolved as soon as possible. They also sent a letter to various sectors of society, which stated: "Dear Sirs, Our committee, in view of the repeated requests to implement the plan to consolidate the</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>postal foundation, which have been rejected by the Ministry of Transportation, and the instability of the postal service, which is as precarious as a pile of eggs, cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the collapse of the postal service. We have no choice but to endure hardship and pain and rise up to save ourselves. We have declared a strike from the 22nd of this month in the hope that the transportation authorities will awaken. Our committee is in a state of great distress. Now, we sincerely inform all sectors of society that this strike is truly out of love for the postal service and to save it. Our loyalty and sincerity can be testified by Heaven and Earth. Considering that the postal service is a public utility and is closely related to all sectors of society, we hope that you will sympathize with our efforts to save the postal service. We have always admired your leadership and your upholding of righteousness. We earnestly request your assistance to maintain the postal service. We offer our most sincere prayers."</p>
<h3>The Rise of Supporters</h3>
<p>The entire staff of the Supply Division of the Jiaozhou Road Postal Administration, numbering over two hundred, are also members of the two associations and have now joined in the unified action. It is understood that the Supply Division is the central hub for the supply of postal supplies and stationery nationwide. In addition, those who have offered assistance and condolences include: (1) The Tongyi Association of clerks of the Shanghai Wireless Telegraph Main Station of the Ministry of Transportation sent a letter to the association, which stated: "Dear Sirs, Your association's contribution of grand ideas for striving for the consolidation of the state-owned transportation industry and seeking ways to save the postal service has been rejected by the authorities. You have not avoided difficulties and have resolutely persevered in your struggle. We express our utmost admiration and sympathy. Our association, on behalf of all its members, extends our sincere wishes that your association will achieve final victory and reach its initial goals. We will do our best within our capabilities to provide assistance. This letter is sent to express our condolences and to seek your understanding." (2) The Shanghai Toothbrush Industry Union, the Shanghai Ink Manufacturing Industry Union, and others have also sent letters of condolence. In addition, the employees of the five wharves of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Tea Room, the Steamboat Wood Industry, the Ink Manufacturing, the Hat Manufacturing, the Cigarette Rolling in the four districts, the Knitting in the two districts, the Shipbuilding in the one district, the Laundry, the Dyeing in the three districts, the Shipbuilding in the four districts, the Cleaning in the four districts, the Public Transportation in the six districts, the Lithography, the Tobacco Exchange, the Sauce Industry, the Pharmaceutical Industry, the Tea and Snack Industry, the Water and Electricity in the six districts, the Toothbrush Industry, the Cotton Spinning in the seven districts, the Fragrance Industry, the Dyeing Industry, the Silk Weaving and Garment Making in the two districts, the Rubber Industry in the six districts, the Soap and Medicine in the nine districts, the Egg Industry in the four districts, the Sand Casting, the Catering, and the Inland Steamboat and more than seventy other labor unions also jointly issued a declaration yesterday in support.</p>
<h3>The Mediation of the General Labor Union</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union, in response to the postal strike, convened a temporary emergency meeting yesterday morning at 10 a.m., chaired by Zhou Xuexiang. The following measures were decided to provide assistance: (1) Telegraph the Executive Yuan to promptly adopt the plan so that it can be resolved as soon as possible. (2) Issue a declaration. (3) Issue a letter to fellow workers. (4) Appoint Li Yongxiang, Zhou Xuexiang, Yu Xianting, Shao Xubai, Lu Muqin, Weng Ruifu, Long Peiyun, and Liu Jintai to consult with the municipal government on mediation opinions. (5) Schedule a representative assembly to discuss further measures. (6) Appoint Zhou Xuexiang, Weng Ruifu, Yu Xianting, and Li Yongxiang to offer condolences. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., Li Yongxiang and others went to the City Hall to inquire about the mayor's mediation opinions. Because the mayor was attending a takeover meeting, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun met with them on his behalf. The two sides exchanged opinions. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun hoped that the General Labor Union should sympathize with the postal strike but should also consider the government's position and do its best to persuade the workers not to expand the labor unrest. He also promised to convey the representatives' opinions to the mayor and schedule another meeting to discuss the matter. The telegraph sent by the union to the Executive Yuan is as follows: "To President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Nanjing: The Shanghai postal workers, in order to save the postal service from its perilous state, have carefully considered the matter and pledged their loyalty. They have submitted a plan to consolidate the postal foundation to the Ministry of Transportation. The various points they have raised are in fact the unanimous demands of all sectors of society. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Federation, and other organizations have all sympathized and responded. However, the Ministry of Transportation has not only failed to adopt the plan but has also accused them of deliberately causing trouble and has slandered them. As a result, the postal workers' emotions have boiled over, leading to this unfortunate strike. The Ministry of Transportation cannot escape blame for its improper handling of the situation. Now that the strike has already broken out, if it is not properly handled, there is a risk of it spreading across the country. The impact would be extremely significant. Therefore, we urgently request the Executive Yuan to promptly instruct the Ministry of Transportation to comply with public opinion and adopt the plan as much as possible so that it can be resolved as soon as possible and avoid expanding the unrest. We are extremely anxious. We respectfully send this telegraph and request your consideration and implementation. Shanghai General Labor Union."</p>
<h3>Investigation of Bribery and Transportation Preparation</h3>
<p>According to responsible representatives of the two postal unions, since the news was reported the day before yesterday that the Ministry of Transportation had received a secret report that someone had used 30,000 yuan to instigate the Shanghai postal workers' strike, the two unions believe that this movement is entirely for the love of the postal service and to save it. The intention is extremely clear. This kind of secret report affects the reputation of the two unions and is infuriating. The two unions immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Transportation to thoroughly investigate the truth and make a clear statement. To this day, the Ministry of Transportation has not made a clear statement as to whether the news reported is accurate. The two unions have now entrusted their legal counsel, lawyers Jiang Yiping and Chen Tingrui, to prepare the procedures to file a public lawsuit in accordance with the law to protect their reputation and legal rights.</p>
<h3>Clarification of the Ministry of Transportation's Clarification</h3>
<p>The Strike Committee of the Shanghai Postal Workers Union and the Shanghai Postal Employees Union believes that there are many errors in the points made by the Ministry of Transportation in its clarification of the two unions' proposed plan to consolidate the postal foundation, which were published in today's newspapers. Therefore, they are providing further clarification based on the facts, which states: "Upon investigation, the Ministry of Transportation's arguments can be summarized into five points: (1) Copying Japanese precedents necessitates separation. (2) Developing postal savings and remittances requires a separate bureau. (3) Selecting specialized talent for the Savings and Remittance Bureau does not require examination, and the Postal Administration does not need to be involved. Regarding the other points, the facts about the dismissal of the former director and the appointment of personnel within the bureau, as well as the recall of postal personnel, are self-evident and do not require clarification from our committee. Let us first discuss the Japanese precedents. Japan is a small country, but because its national economy is prosperous, its total savings exceed 300 million yuan. Therefore, it is necessary to have separate bureaus to manage it. China's postal lines are extensive, and its postal districts are vast, but its total savings are only 30 million yuan. The size of the business scope differs by a hundredfold. It is like a poor family pretending to be wealthy, which is ridiculous. Moreover, the management rights of the Japanese Savings Bureau still remain within the postal system. The administrative and personnel systems are also the same as the postal system. Although they are separated, they are not truly separated. The establishment of another bureau is only another part of the Postal Administration. It is not like our Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, where the Postal Administration does not need to be involved. Since it is called the postal service, how can the Postal Administration not need to be involved? What is the meaning of the word 'General' in the name 'Postal Administration'? The bureau also operates banking business, which is not allowed by national laws and is also not permitted by the Japanese Savings Bureau. As for the speculative, extravagant, and various other businesses that should not and cannot be carried out in the postal service, the bureau engages in them all, thinking it is a proud creation, but it does not know that it is greatly contrary to the original purpose of establishing postal savings. The so-called imitation of Japanese precedents is neither in name nor in substance, and it is truly a mere imitation with no value. This is the first point. The Ministry of Transportation says that postal savings were not developed under the management of the Postal Administration, so there is a need to set up a specialized management organization and vigorously promote it. This shows a lack of understanding of the internal affairs of the postal service and the function of savings. The postal service is a state-owned enterprise whose purpose is to facilitate the public. Its operation of postal savings is to encourage limited savings by ordinary people. It is not comparable to ordinary banking businesses. Therefore, the Postal Administration has restrictions on the operation of savings. Individual savings cannot exceed 2,000 yuan per year, and group savings cannot exceed 3,000 yuan per year. Monthly savings cannot exceed 200 yuan. These regulations show that the reason why rural savings could not increase in the past was due to the postal service's business policy. It was not a question of setting up a bureau to manage and promote it. If the postal bureau cancels the restriction policy and operates according to the methods of banks, then the amount of increase may be more than what it is now. Moreover, given the current state of poverty among the people, ordinary people do not even have enough to eat and wear, so they have no surplus to save. It is difficult for postal savings to achieve a sudden increase. This is the result of social change. To think that setting up another bureau and promoting it can promote its development is truly ignorant of the content of postal savings and the national and social conditions, and it is a Utopian dream. Let us also discuss the item of remittances. Before the separation, the total amount of remittances reached more than 130 million yuan per year. According to the statistics for last year, it only reached more than 160 million yuan. The so-called promotion and development is indeed the case. Why does the Ministry of Transportation deliberately exaggerate its claims and deceive society? This is the second point. The Ministry of Transportation says that the personnel of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau are experts and are also postal workers. Why should there be such a clear distinction and opposition? I do not know that what our committee opposes is the system, not the people. The postal service has many businesses, and there are quite a few talents. The selection and appointment of personnel is not like the rapid turnover of the bureau. It is based on formal examinations by the postal bureau. During the term of appointment, promotion, demotion, rewards, and punishments all have a fixed system. There has never been the arbitrary appointment and dismissal of personnel like in the bureau. The postal examination system is a common practice for the appointment of personnel in various civilized countries. It is not a matter of taking an examination to monopolize the business. As for the Ministry of Transportation's saying that postal personnel cannot be proficient in savings and remittance business, and the necessity of selecting experts, let us ask, postal savings have been managed by postal personnel for thirty years, and the main directors and section chiefs of the bureau must be transferred from postal personnel. The business in various places must also be handled by postal personnel. Why deny the facts and say that there are no talents who are proficient in savings and remittance among postal personnel? Moreover, the experts selected by the bureau are either relatives of powerful people or are supported by friends. In fact, they all hold ordinary clerical positions. The daily documents and official duties are not entirely related to savings and remittance. This shows that their words are unfounded. This is the third point. As for the Ministry of Transportation's saying that setting up a separate bureau does not waste postal funds, it is a blatant lie. After the establishment of the bureau, because it is another main bureau, it must pay 360,000 yuan per year to the Ministry of Transportation for routine expenses, according to the example of the Postal Administration. The bureau's headquarters and the two branch bureaus in Hankou and Nanjing have deputy directors, directors, deputy directors, managers, deputy managers, section chiefs, section members, clerks, trainees, police officers, consultants, and committee members, etc. The salaries and office expenses amount to 1.56 million yuan, which are all borne by the postal bureau. The branch expenses of the National Bureau for the combined operation of savings and remittance business are more than 6 million yuan. The so-called no waste of funds is shocking. In short, the bureau has been separated for three years, and the results have been shown to society through the recent increase in postal rates. If the Ministry of Transportation does not promptly pull back from the brink and merge the bureau back into the Postal Administration, then the postal foundation will be shaken, and the result of the postal service will be no different from that of the telegraph and navigation. The two associations base their sincere suggestions to the Ministry of Transportation on their experience in serving the postal service. Sending telegrams and petitions is time-consuming and laborious, which is unbearable. What they care about is protecting the last remaining postal service in the country, preserving the interests of the people and the dignity of the country. The Ministry of Transportation is the national transportation administrative agency, and it should openly accept the will of the people. The people's suggestions for improving the business are by no means comparable to coercion or interference in administration. It is the expression of the spirit of democracy. Moreover, the postal foundation is being shaken and urgently needs to be rescued."</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Instruction</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report from Nanjing on the 23rd stated: "President Wang of the Executive Yuan telegraphed Mayor Wu of Shanghai on the 23rd, saying: 'To Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai, Today's political meeting has decided on the policy regarding the postal workers' strike. The Executive Yuan is instructing the Shanghai Municipal Government as follows: According to your telegram of the 22nd, the Shanghai Postal Employees Union and the Postal Workers Union held a strike at 5 a.m. today. Article 3 of the Trade Union Law states that employees and workers of national administrative, transportation, military, and state-owned industries shall not invoke this law to organize trade unions. Article 23 also states that trade unions organized by workers in the industries listed in Article 3 shall not declare strikes. Article 37 states that when a trade union has any of the following circumstances, the competent authorities shall disband it: (1) The basic elements of existence are not available; (2) The violation of laws and regulations is serious; (3) The disruption of public order or harm to the public interest. Now, the Shanghai postal workers are not abiding by the laws and regulations and are holding a strike at a time when the situation is serious and the country is in difficulty, which is a form of coercion. This has a significant impact on the country and society. The government should immediately instruct the competent authorities to handle it in accordance with the law. Now, we are giving leniency and instructing you, Mayor, to earnestly persuade the postal workers to return to work immediately. The government will consider whether or not to handle the suggestions regarding postal affairs separately. If they still do not realize their mistake, then the government, in order to protect the national transportation agencies, public order, and the public interest, will have to implement strict measures. This is the instruction. You must comply and not disobey. This order is from Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan."</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu's Statement</h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Nanjing on the 23rd stated: "Chen Mingshu told the press on the 23rd regarding the Shanghai postal unrest that the Shanghai postal strike had been brewing for a long time, and the government had made considerable preparations and would thoroughly resolve it soon without expanding the unrest. The reasons for the strike put forward by the trade unions are not related to the interests of the postal workers themselves but involve the national administrative system, which is very unconventional. Within my authority, in addition to reporting to the central government for thorough handling in accordance with the law, there is no other way. According to reports, the striking workers posted many improper slogans, such as 'Down with so-and-so' and 'Support so-and-so.' These troublemakers are not to be pitied, but it is a great pity that the majority of postal workers who have been loyal to their duties and have contributed to the national revolution are also affected by the minority."</p>
<h3>Yu Feipeng's Report</h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Nanjing on the 23rd stated: "Transportation Vice Minister Yu Feipeng reported at the memorial week on the 33rd that he believed that the four demands of the Shanghai postal union were unreasonable. He also said that Minister Chen dismissed Long Dafu, the Director of the Postal Affairs Department, because he did not handle the unrest well. It is the inherent right of the superior to discipline the subordinate for dereliction of duty. Director Qian Chunqi was detained because of reports from various sources that Qian was suspected of being involved in the strike. He has now been handed over to the judicial authorities for handling."</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 23rd stated: "Transportation Vice Minister Yu Feipeng announced at a ministry meeting today that the Ministry of Transportation has agreed to restore the rice allowance for postal employees with monthly salaries below 80 yuan. The plan to cut staff and reduce administration will also be postponed. However, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau cannot be merged with the Postal Administration as requested by the strikers. In addition, the contracts signed with various airlines cannot be canceled."</p>
<h3>Chen Gongbo Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 33rd stated: "The government is paying close attention to the postal workers' strike in Shanghai. Yesterday, the leaders held a full-day meeting in Tangshan to discuss mediation methods. Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo has been ordered by President Wang to travel to Shanghai this morning to investigate the truth."</p>
<h3>Lin Shi Denies Mediation</h3>
<p>According to sources from the central government yesterday, the rumor that the Ministry of Transportation had sent former Postal Administrator Lin Shi to mediate the postal unrest is not true. As for the case of Mr. Lin's contract for printing stamps during his tenure as administrator, the central government had investigated and found no evidence of corruption. The 9th State Council meeting of the Executive Yuan on January 20th approved the report to the National Government to withdraw the investigation case (see National Government Gazette No. 682, January 27th, 20th year). The so-called pretexts for requesting the central government to be lenient and exempt from further investigation are also not true.</p>

<h3>The Central Supervisory Committee Discussed the Impeachment of Wang Yesterday</h3>
<p>On the Grounds That the Agreement Procedures Were Complete</p>
<p>The Motion to Punish Wang Was Rejected</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Supervisory Committee convened a meeting of supervisory committee members in the capital on the 23rd to discuss the impeachment of Wang Jingwei. As a result, it was decided that since the ceasefire agreement had been passed by the Central Political Council and the procedures were complete, there was no need to discuss the Supervisory Yuan's request to punish Wang. A report was submitted to the Central Political Council immediately. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Described the Signing Process</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Central Political Council on the 23rd, with Jiang Zhongzheng presiding and Yu Youren absent, Wang gave a detailed explanation of the signing of the Shanghai ceasefire agreement, which stated that before the agreement was signed, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had reported the content of the agreement to the Executive Yuan and submitted it to the Central Political Council for review and deliberation. The council then discussed whether or not it should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and decided that the situation could be notified to the Legislative Yuan by the Central Political Council, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Mo reported to the Legislative Yuan on record. This type of agreement is different from the signing of international treaties. The impeachment proposed by the Supervisory Yuan was presumably due to a misunderstanding of the case.

This is not comparable to an ordinary violation of the law. If you use the name of punishment to quell the public anger of the people, then so be it. If you are acting for the sake of the country and the nation, please take a further step and declare it invalid. If the content of the agreement does indeed sacrifice rights and humiliate the country, then those who have harmed the country should be severely investigated and punished.

<h3>Chen Jitang Actively Deploys Defenses on the West River</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang generally agreed to Hu Hanmin's proposal to mediate the naval unrest, agreeing to divide the navy under the jurisdiction of the Jiangfang and Haifang command posts. In peacetime, the Haifang ships would be under the jurisdiction of the Political Council, and the Jiangfang ships would be under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. However, in wartime, the Haifang and Jiangfang ships must be under the unified jurisdiction of one group. Chen Ce was also asked to transfer all the land troops of Qiongyai back to the province for reorganization by the Political Council. Chen Jitang sent Chen Rong to Hong Kong on the 20th to meet with Hu Hanmin and present the above proposals. Hu negotiated with Chen Ce for two days, and Chen Ce believed that he could not accept them. Chen Rong returned to the province on the 21st to report back. Chen Jitang therefore decided to use force against Qiong and sent someone to Macao to welcome Zhao Guizhang back to the province to carry out the reconciliation and appeasement of the navy again. It was decided that Zhao would be given the position of naval commander if the matter was successful. Zhao has already returned to the province. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Postal Protection Movement Across Various Regions</h3>
<p>Two Postal Associations Host Representatives from All Circles in Beijing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This afternoon, the Nanjing Postal Workers' Union and the Jiangsu-Anhui Postal Workers' Union hosted over a hundred representatives from agricultural, industrial, commercial, academic, women's, overseas Chinese, news, legal, banking, and financial circles at the Central Hotel. Representatives Kong Fanzao and Wang Shushen respectively reported on the reasons and aims of the postal protection movement. They also explained the necessity of abolishing the merger of the postal savings and remittance bureau, ceasing the allocation of subsidies to airlines, postal economic self-sufficiency, implementing special accounting, and maintaining the postal system. Finally, they declared that the postal strike in Shanghai is serious. The position and responsibilities of the two postal workers' unions in Nanjing and the Jiangsu-Anhui region are extremely important. The workers' unions in various ports along the Yangtze River have always been under the leadership of this region, and their actions are sufficient to affect the overall situation. Therefore, it has been decided to adopt peaceful movement and reasonable methods to request the authorities to accommodate their consistent views and resolve the issue as soon as possible, so as to avoid the expansion of the incident. This joint movement is entirely for the purpose of protecting the postal service and has absolutely no other background or color. They hope that all sectors will provide assistance.

The current expenditure of 3.5 million yuan for this project is expected to be completed by the end of the month. "We are very ashamed. Why didn't we repair the Grand Canal before the breach, avoiding such huge losses? It is easier to prevent things before they happen than to remedy them afterward. The people have suffered many losses in recent years, and we can only blame ourselves. We must break through the adverse environment and achieve our ideal goals. We must have active confidence, but on the other hand, we must have even deeper self-criticism. So-called confidence is confidence in the entire party, not in oneself. If we only believe in ourselves, it is worse than having no confidence at all. We also recall the relief of disaster victims. The central government has spent a lot of money, but there are still many victims in Henan and Shaanxi who have not received relief. Thinking of these difficult issues, we feel even more the great responsibility of our party. In the future, we cannot cope with the current difficulties without the strength of the entire party. We can never gain the sympathy and trust of others without constant self-criticism. In short, we can only overcome this difficulty and complete the mission of the revolution by having confidence in the party and self-criticism regarding our responsibilities," and so on.

Premier Sun Yat-sen said, 'Knowing is difficult, acting is easy.' We should take this as our guiding principle. With your talent and ambition, you will surely comfort the overseas Chinese. The association was initiated after the 'May Third' tragedy and was originally an overseas Chinese protection agency. It was transferred to the central government in the eighteenth year of the Republic. The association has been powerless to remedy the disputes in Nanyang's Party affairs, the losses suffered by overseas Chinese, the oppression in the Fujian-Guangdong region, and the destruction of the education of overseas Chinese returning to reside in the government. I hope that in the future, you will do your best to protect and maintain overseas education, give preferential treatment to those returning to study, make legal protection effective, ensure local safety, so that overseas Chinese will compete to invest in the country, and that industry and mining can be successful," etc. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Saito in Consultation to Form Cabinet</h3>
<p>Japanese People Regard Him as Hindenburg the Second</p>
<p>Gathering National Talents to Join the New Cabinet</p>
<p>Whether He Can Cope with the Current Situation Remains Doubtful</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Saito visited Saionji this morning, and after an earnest discussion on the cabinet formation policy, he visited dignitaries such as Marshal Togo, Speaker of the Privy Council Kuratomi, Minister of the Interior Makino, Count Yamamoto Gonnohyoe, Count Kiyoura Keigo, and Marshal Uehara, as well as elders of the two political parties, Presidents Suzuki and Wakatsuki, and Takahashi Korekiyo and Yamamoto Tatsuo, seeking the support of the two parties.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd The new Prime Minister Saito visited Takahashi today, reportedly intending to invite him to serve as Minister of Finance. It is also reported that Wakatsuki, the leader of the Minseito party and former prime minister, has decided to decline the cabinet position, but will allow the Minseito party to support the new cabinet, and recommend Baron Yamamoto, an advisor to the Minseito party, as his representative. Although this news has not been verified, it is sufficient to show that Saito is trying to recruit national talents, regardless of which party they belong to. At the same time, he seeks to connect the two major political parties to cope with the serious national crisis that Japan is believed to be facing. Although the candidates for the new cabinet are still unpredictable, Saito's handling of politics has won almost universal praise, because the public recognizes that the current difficulties can only be saved by a true leader who can unify the country like German President Hindenburg, who is not suspected of any party conspiracy, can gain the trust of the country, and puts national interests and people's happiness above everything else. The current disturbances across the country are not small in the minds of the people. Now, with a fair and honest politician like Saito as Prime Minister, he will surely alleviate the fears, and at least temporarily restore credibility. However, everything still depends on how the cabinet handles the current economic situation, and whether it can permanently eliminate hidden dangers. The agricultural area is particularly important, so the position of Minister of Finance must be carefully selected.</p>
<h3>Predictions for Cabinet Member Candidates</h3>
<p>Saito's cabinet formation policy has not yet been decided. Roughly, three from the Seiyukai, two from the Minseito. The candidates are Seiyukai: Takahashi Korekiyo, Tokonami Takejiro, Mizuno Rentaro, Mitsuchi Chuzo; Minseito: Izawa Takio, Yamamoto Tatsuo, Machida Chuji, Kawasaki Takuzo, etc., are all under consideration. Matsumoto Joji, Nagata Hidejiro, Prince Konoe Fumimaro, Count Kodama Hideo, Viscount Makino Tadamasa, Arichika Chuichi, and Baron Hayashi Hirotaro of the House of Peers are also highly vocal. Hiranuma and Yuasa are also candidates. Among them, the most certain are Mizuno, Mitsuchi, Tokonami, Kodama, and Makino. Foreign Minister Uchida Kosai and Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira are said to be powerful. Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo, Army Minister is internally set to be Lieutenant General Masaki, and the Navy Minister will be selected from between Admirals Abo and Okada. Hiranuma is internally set as Minister of Justice, Secretary General Kuyama Tsurukichi, Director General of the Legislation Bureau is either Arichika or Matsumoto, and the Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Department will be selected from among Akaike Ko, Goto Fumio, and Shibata Yoshisaburo.

(Domei, Tokyo, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Minseito Actively Assists</h3>
<p>President Wakatsuki visited Yamamoto this afternoon at 2:20 PM to report on the details of Saito's negotiation to join the cabinet. After discussion, because the current situation is critical, the Minseito should work hard to assist and has reached a consensus. Yamamoto may join the cabinet due to the surrounding situation, so President Wakatsuki visited Saito at 5:40 PM this afternoon and formally replied that the Minseito has decided to assist the new cabinet, but is afraid that its strength will be insufficient, so members of the party will join the cabinet, but he cannot join the cabinet. As for the specific measures, they will meet again for discussion. (Domei, Tokyo, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Seiyukai Passively Supports</h3>
<p>President Suzuki convened elders and advisors such as Tokonami, Kuhara, Okazaki, Ogawa, and Mochizuki, and the chief secretary, at the Prime Minister's official residence at 8:00 PM, and the results of the decided policy are as follows, the remaining is the issue of candidates: (1) President Suzuki will not join the cabinet; (2) If requested to determine the number of Seiyukai members to join the cabinet, the situation of the party must be considered before joining the cabinet; (3) If a specific request is made for someone to join the cabinet, President Suzuki will consult with the candidate before joining the cabinet.</p>

<h3>International Anti-War Congress</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Convene in Geneva on August 1st</p>
<p>The Premier's Wife is Also One of the Initiators</p>
<p>國民社 (Kuomin News Agency) dispatch from Paris, 22nd: The International Anti-War Congress has been scheduled to convene in Geneva on August 1st. Its executive committee today appealed to men and women of goodwill throughout the world, regardless of political affiliation, to give full support to the Congress. One section of the appeal stated, "War has now broken out in the Far East. Japan has invaded China. Whether the results will lead to intervention in Soviet Russia or become a flood engulfing the whole world depends on how the work of this Congress shifts world opinion." The signatories to the Anti-War Congress appeal include Madame Sun Yat-sen, Professor Einstein, Romain Rolland, Tresca, Barbusse, Gorky, Sinclair, Mann, and many other world-renowned writers and scientists.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from London, 22nd: The great scientist, German Professor Einstein, has been residing in Oxford for several weeks. He recently departed for Geneva with Lord Ponsonby, the chairman of the International Anti-War Congress, to jointly protect peace and justice. Many members of the Congress saw them off at the station platform. As Professor Einstein does not speak English well, Mr. Ponsonby made a statement to the press on his behalf, briefly stating, "We are going to Geneva in a private capacity, because public opinion is more accurate than the representatives of the disarmament conference. Our purpose is not only to observe how everything is proceeding. So far, the work of the disarmament conference is less about permanently eliminating war and more about jointly avoiding war. Global public opinion hopes for the success of the disarmament conference like a great drought hopes for clouds. If the conference fails, it will have an ominous effect on public opinion." Professor Einstein will first thoroughly study this problem and then propose practical proposals. He will return to England after staying in Geneva.</p>
<h3>British Poet Holds Pessimistic View of the Current Situation</h3>
<p>"The Night is Dark, Dawn Still Awaits"</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London, 23rd: Prominent literary figures such as Kipling and Wells have all published writings believing that the world situation must worsen before it can take a turn for the better. Kipling published a new poem in today's Morning Post, the opening line of which reads, "The night is dark, dawn still awaits." Wells, currently traveling in Spain, told a Reuters reporter in Madrid that if countries cannot quickly establish an organization to control global finance, cultural decline will be inevitable.</p>
<h3>World's Premier Gold Nation Also Feels Economic Panic</h3>
<p>Budget Deficit</p>
<p>Unemployment Rises Sharply</p>
<p>United States Fails to Devise Good Policies to Restore its Former Position</p>
<p>World Commercial Prosperity Will Never Be Revived. Reuters dispatch from London, 22nd: The United States, possessing half of the world's gold, which has long been revered as the foundation of its prosperity, is gradually showing signs of dissolution under the pressure of the current economic panic. Financiers and politicians are deeply anxious. World commentators are now offering advice on restoring sound policies. The United States occupies a gear-like position in the world trade machine. Only when the gear turns can the world trade machine operate. Therefore, the revival of Europe depends on the United States restoring its gear-like position. For this reason, although observers know that the fundamentals of the U.S. economic power will not be shaken and that its future recovery is assured, they cannot help but feel apprehensive about the increasingly serious situation in the United States. Some say that although the U.S. budget is currently in deficit by a large amount, it can eventually be balanced. More important than fiscal policy is the difficult problem of the large number of unemployed. The rule of law in the United States is solid, but actions that undermine the rule of law can also be taken at any time. If private charitable funding is exhausted, the future of the United States has very serious possibilities. Given the current situation in the United States, the amount of funds being withdrawn from the United States by foreigners is quite large. If this continues, all of New York's foreign exchange reserves will be completely depleted in a relatively short period. However, the United Kingdom, in accordance with the policy set by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, established a pound exchange equalization fund to sell pounds and buy U.S. dollars, resulting in approximately 200 million yuan being deposited in the United States. This can offset some of the withdrawals by foreigners. The absolute collapse in the value of U.S. securities can be seen in the stock market listings. The face value of several major railway securities is approximately 200 million yuan, which rose to a high of 350 million yuan in 1929 but has now fallen to 28 million yuan. The U.S. railway freight business has also declined sharply. In the week before May 14th this year, freight cars transported 521,000 vehicles, while at the same time last year, there were 748,000 vehicles.</p>
<h3>Greek Labor Unrest Eases</h3>
<p>Search for Successor to the Premiership</p>
<p>國民社 (Kuomin News Agency) dispatch from Athens, 22nd: Today, the Greek labor unrest has made some progress. Since the authorities threatened striking leaders with military trials, postal workers resumed work this morning. Railway workers, who were about to join the strike last night, have also softened their stance. However, the situation in Macedonia and Thessaly remains extremely critical. Today, the newspapers published the full text of Prime Minister Venizelos's resignation letter to the President last night. Regarding the current situation, it stated that the civil servants' strike must be regarded as an attempt at revolution. He strongly advocated that Greece must be considered to be in a state of war until all work is resumed and order is restored everywhere. Finally, he suggested adding a clause to the constitution authorizing the President to temporarily suspend all civil rights, including the right to strike, if national security is endangered by the exercise of civil rights. This morning, the President and the Speakers of both houses of Parliament met for a long time. Subsequently, he summoned Tsaldaris, a political leader who is highly regarded by the people. However, it is reported that Mr. Tsaldaris expressed his unwillingness to form a cabinet. Therefore, the President is expected to choose the next Prime Minister from between Panagiotis Tsaldaris, the leader of the United Republican Party, and General Kondylis, the leader of the National Republican Party.</p>

<h3>Prussian Prime Minister Resigns</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Berlin, 22nd: Dr. Braun, the Prime Minister of Prussia, who has been in office for several years, officially resigned today due to the National Socialist Party's great victory in the parliamentary elections. However, the National Socialist Party does not have an absolute majority in Parliament. The Communist Party, with 57 members, is the force that sways Parliament. Therefore, the task of forming a new cabinet will be very difficult. It is likely that the Braun cabinet will maintain office temporarily.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Muslims and Hindus in India Gradually Subsides</h3>
<p>138 Dead</p>
<p>1,600 Injured</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Bombay, 23rd: The conflict between Muslims and Hindus in India intensified again on Thursday, especially in the cotton mill area. However, it has gradually subsided since then. Although there are still occasional clashes here today, resulting in one death and seven injuries, the atmosphere is no longer as tense as before. The police have been working tirelessly day and night for many days and are now feeling fatigued. Therefore, the Governor of Bombay has called on local auxiliary forces and the Bombay Light Horse to assist the police in maintaining order. People are leaving the city one after another, mostly heading to Pune, from where they will go to the countryside. According to the official report released, as of Friday night, there were a total of 128 deaths and 1,600 injuries.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Cabinet Amidst Chaotic Political Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>Eight Factions Compete to Rise</p>
<p>The Military Faction Generally Predominates</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reports: At a time when national life is under pressure and the political tide is rapidly changing, talk of an extraordinary cabinet is being seriously discussed. Among those most active in this regard, there are eight factions. The first is the coalition cabinet movement led by Adachi. This faction has a number of strategists who are actively working to achieve this. However, the extent to which the public trusts party politics and the intentions of Saionji are difficult to predict. At present, the question of whether to reform political parties, reorganize political parties, or form a coalition of political parties is intertwined. Due to the urgency of the situation, the form of the extraordinary cabinet that will be formed is also a major issue in the near future. Those who are considered to be heads of the extraordinary cabinet are none other than Marshal Togo, Saito Makoto, Yamamoto Gonnohyoe, Ozaki Yukio, Izawa Takio, Ugaki Kazushige, and Hiranuma Kiichiro. However, there are also those who support the current Chief of the General Staff, Prince Kan'in Kotohito, and the Chief of the Naval General Staff, Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu. Those who support Marshal Togo are members of the Satsuma faction, following the precedent of Hindenburg in Germany. Saito Makoto has been actively working on the coalition cabinet movement since resigning from the position of Governor-General of Korea. Yamamoto Gonnohyoe also has the support of some people. Others, such as those who admire the Gakudo faction, have been promoting Ozaki Yukio, who returned from a foreign trip last year. However, among the young officers of the military, who are resentful of the corruption of established politicians and have changed their minds from the past two or three years of liberalism, many tend towards patriotism. Izawa Takio was rumored to be promoted after the reorganization of the Minseito. The above-mentioned views are confusing and have not yet been resolved. Recently, the Hiranuma promotion movement, which is called the Kokuhonsha and is linked to the Araki faction, and the Ugaki Major General promotion movement, which is linked to the military Ugaki faction and a part of the Minseito, have gradually taken shape. The central figures of the Kokuhonsha, such as Minister of the Army Araki, Minister of the Navy Osumi, and Ota Kozo, have absolute power. Hiranuma, who has no wife or children, lives a monk-like life in his private residence in Nishiohkubo, outside the city. Why does he get the support of various influential figures? Because Hiranuma, in addition to being the Vice President of the Privy Council, has a close relationship with the military centered on the Kokuhonsha. If Hiranuma rises to power, a powerful cabinet will be established with the backing of various military backgrounds. Countless other large and small politicians, surrounding Hiranuma and the Kokuhonsha, also want to join hands and rise up. Among them, Mori Kaku, the secretary general of the Inukai Cabinet, is the most blatant person. If the Hiranuma Cabinet is established, the Kokuhonsha will definitely have a strong mass movement. Moreover, when implementing policies after the formation of the cabinet, it is necessary to maintain a permanent organizational force. The established political parties will naturally be eliminated. However, it is feared that it will not be possible to raise the flag of a new political party in one fell swoop, as the established political parties have built their current base through more than half a century of struggle. As for General Ugaki Kazushige, there was a movement to join the Minseito in the past. Now, the Ugaki faction in the Minseito is linked to the Ugaki system in the military, aiming to succeed Wakatsuki with Ugaki. If Ugaki comes out, his regime will probably not belong to the Minseito in accordance with the usual constitutional path. Otherwise, under Ugaki, a cabinet of party alliances will be formed with the Minseito as the main body. However, it is also doubtful whether the anti-Ugaki system in the military can agree to it. In addition, the promotion of social nationalism advocated by Nakanono Seigo, who is active on the surface of the political world, the state socialism of Shimochu Yasaburo and Akamatsu Katsumaro, and the actions of various political factions such as the Greater Japan Production Party and the Patriotic Labor Party are also very fierce. Before the establishment of the new party, Nakanono Seigo traveled around the country, promoting social nationalism, which gained the sympathy of the people. However, Nakanono's political power is weak, so it is difficult to realize. In short, in this chaotic situation, each faction is doing its best, secretly leaping, and it is unknown who will win. It is worth noting.</p>
<h3>Osaka Mainichi Shimbun The Imminent U.S.-Japan War Machine (Continued)</h3>
<p>U.S. diplomat Lansing took the U.S. Secretary of State Bryan's protest to Japan during the Sino-Japanese negotiations in 1915, which was clearly aimed at protecting U.S. interests. However, Wilson in Paris and Hughes in Washington were no less than servants of China, catering exclusively to the psychology of the Chinese people, rejecting Japan's demands, and criticizing Japan's rights and interests. They used the protection of China's happiness as a banner, used morality as a shield, and skillfully wielded the gun of practical interests. This is truly the skill of American politicians in recent diplomatic history. No wonder the U.S.'s Far Eastern policy has been well-received by the Chinese people. Even Sun Yat-sen, who is comparatively thoughtful among modern Chinese people, regarded Japan as "imperialistic diplomacy" and the U.S. as "friendly diplomacy," falsely dividing the differences between Japan and the U.S., and training in the American method. As a result, the trend of rejecting Japan and flattering the U.S. spread almost throughout the country. Moreover, Shi Zhaoji, the former ambassador to the U.S., exerted his catering nature in the U.S. and concluded mining contracts for coal in Shaanxi and oil in Sichuan with American capitalists. On the one hand, he abandoned the promotion of the harmful and useless Anglo-Japanese Alliance and planned to form an A.B.C. alliance with China as the stage (A is America, B is British, C is China).</p>
<p>In the 20 years since the Russo-Japanese War, the U.S.'s attitude in the world can be said to be "grandly supporting China." Therefore, it is natural for them to strike a final iron hammer at Japan, based on their traditional vanity, to compete with Japan.</p>
<p>The relationship between the Manchurian problem and the U.S. is so complex. When the Manchurian Incident broke out, what kind of feelings did the U.S.'s attitude produce? Let us verify it with recent facts. (1) The current President Hoover, who is guiding foreign policy, has a utilitarian ideology at his core. Therefore, the U.S. is in a defensive position regarding the Manchurian problem. Miratu recently commented on Hoover, saying, "Hoover's thinking is originally that of a businessman, not a politician." Even today, ten years after he served as Secretary of Commerce, he still does not go beyond the scope of his utilitarianism. He is determined not to risk his own country's fate to compete with others for issues that are not important to his own country's existence. He is particularly unwilling to have active intervention because he understands the gains and losses.</p>
<p>Before the Manchurian Incident, the U.S. was in an unprecedented economic crisis in its history. The number of unemployed people increased sharply, and it was necessary to seek relief for local banks with weak foundations. The whole country was in a state of unease. President Hoover said in his speech at the Lincoln Memorial that he was now worried about the "visible enemy" more than the "invisible enemy" in the face of the economic crisis. Moreover, the current naval strength of the U.S. is inferior to that of the Japanese navy. If it wants to intervene, it must have sufficient and strong military force to protect it. Now that it lacks a strong military force as a backing, it cannot have any dignity. Intervention rashly without dignity will only lead to defeat. Therefore, when the Manchurian Incident broke out, the U.S. wanted to intervene, but it was not allowed by the situation. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japan's Serious Harbor Security</h3>
<p>The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reports: The Director of the Police Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs recently arrived in Nagasaki to inspect the status of harbor security. It is reported that a Korean group has recently secretly planned some improper plans. The Ministry of Home Affairs, in order to prevent it in advance, has spent 500,000 yuan in reserve funds to station harbor inspectors in Shanghai, southern China, Nagasaki, Moji, Shimonoseki, Kobe, Osaka, and other places.</p>

<h3>British Newspaper Comments on Inukai's Assassination: Japan Plans to Conquer the Continent</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reports: The assassination of Prime Minister Inukai has caused great shock throughout the United Kingdom. All parties in the country have serious criticisms. The organ newspaper of the Conservative Party said that, considering the current situation in Japan, the reactionaries are dominated by army and navy officers. The purpose of their politics is to implement a super-patriotic militarism, conquer the continent, and expand the country. In the future, the struggles arising from the ambitions of militarists for Japan's own interests will still not be resolved. The organ newspaper of the Liberal Party commented that the current assassination threatened the government, attempting to implement a military dictatorship. However, since the idea of pacifism is rising in Japan, it is difficult to predict whether a military revolution will be implemented if a revolution occurs. However, Japan has dispatched a large number of troops to Manchuria, which will inevitably lead to a head-on conflict with Russia. If that happens, the League of Nations and other powers will not be able to stand idly by in order to prevent a catastrophe.</p>
<h3>Min People Petition to Suppress the Communists</h3>
<p>Dispatch Representatives to Nanjing to Meet Wang and Chiang</p>
<p>Please Immediately Transfer a Large Army to Fujian at Full Speed</p>
<p>Wait for the Official Announcement Before Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Fujian Association of Shanghai-Based Organizations for Saving the Country, all work is progressing extremely tensely. A few days ago, Qiu Hanping, Zhen Yaogong, and Ge Jianxi were dispatched as representatives to Nanjing to petition. On the afternoon of the 20th, they met with President Wang along with representatives from the Shanghai-Based Association of People from Fujian. Wang personally received them. The representatives presented six key points of the petition: (1) Request the central government to dispatch a large army to Fujian to suppress the communists in the near future in order to save the people's lives. (2) Request the central government to send at least two divisions of capable troops by both land and sea in order to encircle and suppress the communists. (3) Request the central government to appoint a senior military officer to be responsible for directing the suppression of the communists throughout the province. (4) Request the central government to indicate the date of mobilization of the troops aiding Fujian in order to comfort the expectations. (5) Request the central government to provide disaster relief to the refugees in the disaster area in order to avoid displacement and being seduced by the communists. (6) Request the central government to earnestly purify the administration in Fujian and properly plan for the aftermath in order to eliminate the source of the chaos. Wang indicated that all of them could be accepted and said that the government was extremely concerned about the situation in Fujian and had decided to send three divisions of the most capable troops to Fujian at full speed in the shortest possible time and to appoint a senior military officer to uniformly command the suppression of bandits throughout the province. The representatives were satisfied and then excused themselves. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, also received the representatives on the morning of the 22nd. The representatives are waiting for the government to make an official announcement before returning to Shanghai. As for Shanghai, Xie Yinpo and Xiao Bichuan have been recommended to contact various organizations and ask for their sympathetic assistance for Fujian affairs.</p>
<h3>Shandong People Call for Yellow River Control</h3>
<p>Please Help German People with the Cost of Yellow River Control</p>
<p>Please Allocate Boxer Indemnity to Repair the Lower Reaches</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The flooding of the Yellow River is a major disaster in North China, and the provinces of Shandong and Henan are particularly affected. Every year, millions of dollars are spent on Yellow River control, but there is still the risk of breaches. The reason for this is that in the past, only prevention and blocking could be done, and fundamental dredging could not be carried out. The river water carries a large amount of sediment, which has been deposited for a long time. The riverbed is several feet higher than the ground. Once there is a breach, the water flows from top to bottom and cannot be stopped. Dozens of villages are immediately submerged. The losses over the years are countless. German Professor Engels is willing to use his recently established large-scale experimental field to provide experimental planning for Yellow River diversion. However, the required cost of materials and travel expenses of 22,000 yuan must be borne by the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. The Provincial Government has already decided through political conferences to send a telegram to the governments of Hebei and Henan to negotiate and share the expenses. The Caozhou River Engineering Promotion Committee, which belongs to eight counties, has submitted a petition to the Shandong Provincial River Engineering Committee to present it to the Provincial Government as soon as possible to eliminate the huge disaster in North China. It has already been approved by the River Engineering Committee and will be presented to the Provincial Government in writing.</p>
<p>Li Baoren, a member of the River Engineering Committee, believes that the harm caused by the Yellow River is very serious in the lower reaches and should be fundamentally controlled at once. He specifically proposed to submit a petition to the Provincial Government to present it to the Central Government to allocate 800,000 yuan from the Boxer Indemnity to repair the dikes in the lower reaches in order to achieve a permanent solution. His proposal said, "I think that the lower reaches of the Shandong dikes are the most dangerous, and the reason for the danger in the lower reaches is nothing more than the low and thin dikes and the narrow and silted riverbed. In the past, Qing envoy Li Hongzhang was ordered to investigate the river and once奏准the method of treating the symptoms, and a major repair of the dikes was carried out. Since the founding of the Republic of China, more than 20 years have passed, the country has been eventful, and there has been no time for major repairs. Even in times of emergency, occasional repairs have not helped. Years of wind and rain have eroded and washed away, like a whetstone, it has not been seen to be damaged, but there has been a loss every day, and it is still as low and thin as before. Every time there is a strong flood in the autumn, dangerous situations arise. The constitution is weak, and the defense force is lacking. Therefore, in less than a few years, the Gongjia Dam incident occurred in the past, and the Wangji Hutantan also overflowed and broke the dikes one after another. The people's difficulties have not been alleviated, and the dikes are deteriorating day by day. It is estimated that the lower section of the south bank, from Putai Daoxu to Ninghai, and the north bank from Huimin Wuyangjia to Lijin, such as the Liu Tangjia, Li Tingzhuang, Fengjia, Wang Wangzhuang, and Laoguan Zhao Hanjia on the south bank, and the Laojun Tang, Lanjia, Zhao Jia, Temple Palace Jia, and Panjia Jiahe Jiangzhuang on the north bank, etc., are extremely short of water during a strong flood, and even the dikes are level with the water, or temporary sub-dikes are added, or various dangerous situations such as the successive emergence of small holes occur in various places. In addition, the riverbed is silted up, the tail is not connected, the amount cannot be accommodated, and it swells and spreads. If there is a slight oversight, it will immediately lead to confusion. Now, it is not easy to repair and expand, but it is doubly difficult to delay. It is proposed to start with the lower section, and the work should be doubled. According to the maximum water level, it should be 4 feet higher, and the top width should be 4 zhang uniformly. The dangerous work should be doubled. According to the maximum water level, it should be 5 feet higher, and the top width should be 6 zhang uniformly. In addition, the height of the sub-dikes added below Lijin in the autumn of last year is sufficient. If the increase is continued, the work can be completed in one fell swoop. It seems that the back of the dikes should be leveled uniformly again. If this is done, it can not only be done once and for all, but also turn danger into safety. It is estimated that a total of 800,000 yuan will be needed. At a time when the country is eventful and financial resources are tight, it is difficult for the provincial treasury to raise funds, and it is feared that the national treasury will also be difficult to allocate funds. It is found that the Boxer Indemnity will be allocated next time, and various water conservancy agencies are requesting allocation. The Yellow River in this province is also an important project. It is proposed to ask the association to present a case to the Provincial Government to present it to the National Government for approval, and to allocate the aforementioned 800,000 yuan from the Boxer Indemnity so that the River Affairs Bureau can engage in repairs in order to eliminate floods and protect the people's livelihood."</p>
<h3>Wuhan Flood Prevention Continued Report</h3>
<p>Torrential Rains for Weeks, Situation Critical</p>
<p>Recent Water Levels Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: Here, torrential rains have persisted for weeks, and the river is rising rapidly. Wuhan, being the confluence of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, faces an especially dangerous situation. Citizens, recalling last year's tragic disaster, are filled with dread and fear. Initially, the Wutai Sluice Gate suddenly showed signs of danger. As the protection for Wuchang, it suffered delays in repair work, and the river water gradually reached the same level as the gate. Nearby residents appealed to the government. Provincial Chairman Xia Douyin and Construction Bureau Chief Li Shucheng personally inspected the site and confirmed the danger. They specially ordered Water Conservancy Bureau Chief Jiang Mingjing to expedite repairs, estimating that the work could be completed within ten days. If the water does not rise further, the situation can be turned from danger to safety. Secondly, the Hanyang dike from Black Mountain to Lanjiang is also planned for construction. According to the Water Bureau's budget, approximately 300,000 yuan is needed. Detailed plans are currently being drafted. In Hankou, the most important structures are the Zhang Gong Dike and the riverfront flood prevention dikes. The Zhang Gong Dike was previously contracted to the Fifth District Public Works Relief Bureau, but due to mismanagement, no progress was made. Recently, the river water is only a foot or so away from the base of the dike, making the situation very serious. It has now been transferred to the Post-Disaster Relief Committee for handling. Preparations for construction are underway, starting with an outer protective barrier to protect the dike body. Regarding the riverfront flood prevention project, a decision has been made by Chinese and foreign communities: the Chinese street and Special District One and Two will be the responsibility of the Post-Disaster Relief Committee; the Japanese and French concessions will be responsible for their respective areas; and the section below the Japanese concession will be the responsibility of the Pinghan Railway Bureau. Except for the Chinese street section connecting the Japanese concession and passing through Special District One, up to the connection with the French concession, which has already started construction, and the section in Special District Two and the section from Dakou Lane to the Jianghan Customs House, which are preparing for construction, the rest have not yet started. Due to the recent heavy rains, the river water almost reached the riverbanks in an instant, drawing some attention. On the 20th, Chinese and foreign officials and citizens held a flood prevention project meeting, urging progress on all sides. According to Chinese representative Zhao Huanzhang's report, the Special District One section is 70-80% complete and will be finished within a week. Other sections are being rushed, and all are expected to be completed within about a month. The Special District Three representative reported that the Chinese and foreign board of directors of the district approved a meeting of Chinese and foreign taxpayers to be held next Friday to raise funds for construction. The French Concession representative reported that the area is actively proceeding according to the construction plan. The Japanese Concession Japanese Residents' Association representative reported that regarding the project's progress, they are still awaiting government instructions, but when Special District Three and the French Concession start construction, the Japanese Concession will also begin at the same time. The Pinghan Railway Bureau initially seemed to have objections, but has now expressed its agreement. The bureau will be fully responsible for repairing the revetment from Chenjiaji up to Fenjinlu, requiring over 110,000 yuan. The landslide section from Fenjinlu up to the old Belgian pier will also be repaired in combination. If this section is taken over by the Post-Disaster Relief Committee, it will contribute over 25,000 yuan. All projects must be completed by June 12th at the latest, and must not be delayed beyond June 20th. (May 20th)</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the beginning of summer this year, rainfall has been excessive, and the Yangtze River's water level has continued to rise without end. On the 21st, the Jianghai Customs water mark was 32 feet, only 3 feet and 4 inches lower than the same day last year. Citizens are filled with panic. Yesterday, according to water conservancy experts, if there are no more torrential rains in the future, the water level will not rise as rapidly as it has. Even if it rises slightly, there will be no major obstacles. However, in the next few days, the water level will recede just as quickly as it rose recently. (21st)</p>
<h3>Shantou Transport Union's Strike Against British Ships</h3>
<p>No Loading or Unloading of Passengers or Cargo Since the 16th</p>
<p>Shantou Communication: The Shantou Transport Union, formed by lighter wharf workers, has historically received a "small labor fee" for loading, stacking, and storing goods in foreign firms and warehouses. This fee was calculated per item and allocated by the foreign firms to the union, amounting to approximately two to three thousand yuan per year. Last year, the British shipping companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire refused to pay this fee, claiming that it should be collected from the various storage shops. The union repeatedly negotiated with the two foreign firms without success. On the 12th, the Transport Union specially convened a representative conference of various unions, resolving to prepare for a strike and forming a 50-member investigation team to prevent Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire ships from loading or unloading passengers or cargo in Shantou. They also encouraged sailors to strike and disembark at the same time. However, this matter has significant implications for commercial traffic and local security. The municipal government has not paid attention to mediation. On the 14th, the Transport Union convened another representative meeting of relevant groups to discuss the tactics for the strike. They immediately resolved: (1) Starting on the 16th of this month, all work on Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire ships will be suspended. (2) Regarding passengers, because there are many waiting for ships in Shantou, the Hotel Association will first notify outbound passengers from inland counties to postpone their arrival in Shantou. Passenger disembarkation will be suspended one week from the 16th to avoid difficulties for passengers en route. Separately, the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, the Nanyang Water Passengers Joint Association, the Hotel Association, and others sent letters to overseas Chinese in Nanyang, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, urging them not to take the ships of the two foreign firms to avoid having no one to load or unload their goods upon arrival in Shantou. (3) If the issue is not resolved three days after Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson ships arrive in Shantou, the Seamen's Union will notify all workers to leave the ships. (4) Regarding other foreign firms or shops renting Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson warehouses, those who are paid by the customer for loading and unloading work will be allowed to continue working as usual. (5) Losses incurred by workers due to this strike will be investigated and reported by the various friendly associations for separate decisions. (6) If a satisfactory resolution is reached in this case, the various friendly associations should be notified first to discuss various plans for resuming work and handling the aftermath. Since the economic boycott against Japan in Shantou, almost all anti-Japanese businesses have been occupied by Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships have disappeared from Shantou port for over two years. Therefore, this move will have a significant impact on Chaoshan commerce. (May 15th)</p>

<h3>Shirakawa's Life Hanging by a Thread</h3>
<p>Seriously Ill Yesterday Afternoon at 2 PM</p>
<p>Vomiting and Passing Blood, Life in Danger</p>
<p>In a Comatose State This Morning</p>
<p>Japanese Commander Shirakawa was seriously ill yesterday, his life hanging by a thread. As of this morning when this newspaper went to print, he was still clinging to life. According to reports from the Japanese military hospital, Shirakawa's condition at noon yesterday was a body temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius, a pulse of 98, and a respiration rate of 15. By 2:30 PM, he suddenly vomited blood and passed black-reddish blood, and his condition became critical. Hearing the news, officers from the Japanese Command rushed to his sickroom. Doctors immediately administered hemostatic injections and transfused 300 grams of blood. Shirakawa's consciousness was slightly restored. At that time, Acting Consul General Iguchi also arrived at the hospital to convey the Emperor's gift of wine. Chief of Staff Tashiro then arrived to convey the Emperor's imperial message bestowing the title of Baron. After Tashiro read the Emperor's message, Shirakawa drank a glass of wine and was still able to taste its deliciousness. Thereafter, his condition hovered between life and death, showing no signs of improvement.</p>
<p>First-Class Military Surgeon Sanuki Yoshihide from the Japanese Army Hospital was ordered by the Japanese Army Ministry to come to Shanghai to examine Shirakawa. He arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru at 3 PM yesterday and went to examine Shirakawa at 3:30 PM. At that time, Shirakawa was still able to answer silently, but his condition remained critical. The Japanese Navy Ministry telegraphed Commander Nomura at 5 PM tonight, ordering him to escort Shirakawa's remains back to Japan by warship if Commander Shirakawa unfortunately passed away. Whether he can escape danger tonight is truly in doubt. Important Japanese figures in Shanghai have gathered at the military hospital to prepare for any eventuality.</p>

<p>The Japanese troops stationed at Shanghai Station and Zhenru Station were not very numerous. Shanghai Station had only ten or so soldiers, and Zhenru Station had only twenty or thirty. After 10 AM yesterday, they successively withdrew to the headquarters of the military police. By noon, no Japanese troops were visible at either station.</p>
<h3>Received Shanghai and Zhenru Stations Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau had designated personnel to receive the stations yesterday morning. Shanghai Station telegraphed in advance to Yin Zhilu, the Western Section Engineer stationed in Nanxiang, to go to Zhenru Station at that time to handle the handover matters. After receiving the order, Yin, together with Chen Zhonghan, Chief of the Train Operations Corps; Chen Sicheng, Deputy Engineer; and Shen Shao, Suzhou Section Engineer, departed from Nanxiang by handcar at 10 AM yesterday and arrived at Zhenru Station at 11 AM. They reached an agreement with the Japanese troops stationed there. At 11 AM, our Ping An Security Team went to Zhenru Railway Station to take over. Yin then received the station. At 12 PM, he received MacKay Road Station and then went to North Station. The Japanese troops stationed at Shanghai Station withdrew at noon. At 11 AM, the Railway Bureau dispatched Li Zhaoyu, Station Inspector; Zeng Zhihong, North Station Master; Jin Zhu, Train Yard Inspector; and Rong Yi, Chief of the Police Corps; and Gong Guodong, Chief of the First Police Group of North Station, along with twenty or so police officers, and gathered at Meiyuan Road in the Fourth District of Zhabei. After Yin Tixin of the Takeover Committee reached an agreement with the Japanese side, they went to North Station to take over.</p>
<h3>Director Chen and Others Inspect North Station</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Director Chen Xinghan, accompanied by Secretary Ding Zhenheng, Train Operations Director Zheng Baozhao, Deputy Director Yuan Shaochang, Works Director (Westerner) Drashus, Deputy Director Pu Dengqing, Accounting Director Ellis, Deputy Director He Yongyuan, Eastern Section Chief Engineer Feng Qili, Engineer Cheng Pengzhu, and Taweison of the China-British Bank, and others, went to North Railway Station to inspect the locomotive shed, ticket office, train operations office, and the damaged lower level of the Railway Bureau.</p>
<h3>Losses and Repairs at North Station</h3>
<p>Director Chen and the others returned to the bureau at 6 PM. According to those who went with them, all the items inside the North Station had been moved away, and all the glass windows on the station roof were broken, with none surviving. As for the Railway Bureau's headquarters, the second and third floors were almost completely burned down, with only the lower level remaining unburned. The bureau sent employees yesterday to clean up all the accumulated tiles, broken glass, etc., inside the station. It is planned to rebuild the second and third floors of the Railway Bureau's headquarters.</p>
<h3>Jinghu Fully Open Today</h3>
<p>Jinghu</p>
<p>The railway is scheduled to fully open today, with no obstacles from Shanghai to Beijing. Because vehicles loaded with gravel have already arrived in Shanghai yesterday, proving that there is no danger along the way, it has been decided to open today. The Railway Bureau's Train Operations Office will issue a notice today, the contents of which are as follows: "After the Japanese troops withdrew from North Station on the Jinghu Railway, it has been fully received and is scheduled to resume train service between Beijing and Shanghai today. Two round-trip trains will be temporarily opened. The first train from North Station will be a slow train at 10 AM, stopping at all stations, arriving in Beijing at 11 PM. The second train will be a special express train at 3:45 PM, arriving in Beijing at 11:23 PM. Also, the first train from Nanjing Station will be an express train at 7:30 AM, arriving in Shanghai at 4:46 PM. The second train will be a slow train at 8 AM, stopping at all stations, arriving in Shanghai at 9:05 PM."</p>
<h3>Officially Open at the Beginning of the Month</h3>
<p>After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the Jinghu Railway bore the brunt, and the buildings on the railway between Shanghai and Kunshan were almost completely destroyed. Fortunately, all movable assets, such as vehicles and telephones worth 50 million yuan, were rescued before the incident by Zheng Baozhao, Chief of the Train Operations Office of the railway, who risked his life day and night to pull them out. After the Japanese troops withdrew yesterday, the press vehicles were able to travel from Suzhou to Shanghai, and the fact that the railway tracks and bridges along the way were unobstructed was entirely due to the Director of the Bureau Chen Xinghan, Director of the Train Operations Zheng Baozhao, and Director of the Mechanical Affairs Wang Shanshan, who supervised the planning in advance. It is now scheduled to open a temporary special train on the 25th, and officially operate according to the newly revised timetable from approximately June 1st. All offices at North Station will be temporarily located in the flat houses opposite the original site of the destroyed station. Furthermore, it is learned that the Railway Bureau's Train Operations Director Zheng Baozhao has recorded in detail the maintenance of traffic in the rear, the rescue of refugees, and the bombing of various stations after this incident. He has specially compiled and printed it, which was published the day before yesterday, and will be distributed to the transportation and news industries for reference.</p>

<h3>Verdict in the "Dahua Evening News" Case</h3>
<p>The "Dahua Evening News," having not been published for long, was targeted because of its fierce language and attacks on the government. Ma Muya, squad leader of the political department of the French Concession police, discovered that the newspaper had not registered with the Municipal Council during publication, violating the publication law and the provisions of the French Consul. On the evening of the 9th of this month, he first went to Qinyi Printing House at 82 Gelaoke Road, arrested Fan Fuzhi, the owner of the printing house, and seized two sets of lead type and 1,000 copies of today's newspaper. Then, he went to No. 6 Huabao Lane, Huanghe Road, arrested Luo Gusun, the editor from Henan, and seized drafts and documents, taking them all to the police station and escorting them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation. These details have been recorded in previous reports. The case has been concluded after several trials by Judge Wu Fanglian. The verdict was issued yesterday afternoon: Luo Gusun was fined 150 yuan for publishing an unregistered newspaper, and Fan Fuzhi was fined 100 yuan for assisting in the publication of an unregistered newspaper. If they are unable to pay, they will each be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. The two sets of lead type and 1,018 copies of the "Dahua Evening News" were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Protests to French Ambassador</h3>
<p>Regarding the Extradition of Ahn Chang-ho</p>
<p>Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested to French Ambassador Wilden regarding the arrest of Korean Ahn Chang-ho by the French Concession police in Shanghai for extradition to the Japanese authorities.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Requests Immediate Withdrawal of Japanese Troops from Concessions</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council stating: "Respectfully, we received a letter from the temporary office of the Hongkou District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, stating: 'Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, nearly four months have passed. The concession authorities have allowed Japanese troops to occupy and rampage, causing fear and panic among merchants and residents. How can they dare to open the market suddenly? The once prosperous market has now become desolate and unbearable. Who does not feel heartbroken? At this time of ceasefire and troop withdrawal, how can Japanese troops be allowed to rampage in the streets in groups of three or five? The committee of national defense forces should order the Japanese troops to withdraw immediately to restore the previous state so that merchants and residents can operate in peace. The citizens of Hongkou all fulfill their tax obligations and hope to restore commerce. Please send a letter to the concession authorities to negotiate as soon as possible so that the local area can be pacified as soon as possible. Please do not ignore this matter.' We are reviewing this matter. We also received a letter from the Shanghai Citizens' Federation stating the same reasons. Therefore, in the joint effort to restore normalcy, it seems that this unstable force that hinders the restoration of commerce should be removed by all means. Otherwise, who can guarantee that unfortunate events such as those on the south bank of Wuzhen Bridge will not happen again? All those involved are deeply concerned. Based on the reasons stated in the letter, we respectfully request you to investigate and handle this matter and provide a reply."</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Burning of the Japanese Ship</h3>
<p>The Entire Ship Left a Hollow Shell</p>
<p>Many Military Supplies Lost</p>
<p>The Japanese transport ship Bombay Maru (yesterday's report mistakenly stated Guangfu Maru) caught fire at the Huangpu Wharf, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Further details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Continuing to Transport Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>The Japanese army in Jiangwan, Wusong, and Zhabei are all withdrawing. The Japanese Army Ministry has dispatched a total of eight troop transport ships this time. Four ships have already left Shanghai. On the 22nd, a regiment of infantry from the 18th Brigade of the Japanese Army, a battalion of infantry from the 19th Regiment, the 9th Battalion of the Aviation Corps, and a battalion of artillery continued to withdraw, transported by the Japanese ship Jiangsu Maru to the East. The remaining battalions are scheduled to be transported out on the 24th and 25th.</p>
<h3>Cause of the Fire</h3>
<p>The Bombay Maru, Harbin Maru, and others were all docked at the Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu, preparing to load the first battalion of infantry, two artillery companies, the first battalion of the aviation corps, special forces, and communication troops from the Japanese 9th Division, which were withdrawing from Wusong and Zhabei. They were scheduled to leave on the 24th and 25th. Therefore, military gasoline, unused bombs, hand grenades, and heavy explosive bombs for aircraft were unloaded first. The soldiers had to board the ship today. While military equipment, ammunition, and gasoline were being loaded onto the ship, a fire suddenly broke out inside the ship at 7:00 AM on the 22nd. The cause of the fire is said to have been caused by sparks entering ammunition, causing it to explode and spread to the aircraft gasoline, causing the fire to become extremely intense and impossible to extinguish.</p>
<h3>Fire Spreads Fiercely</h3>
<p>After the Japanese Navy discovered the fire on the transport ship, fearing that there were still large amounts of military supplies, bullets, and bombs on the wharf, which were loaded into the Harbin Maru, and even more ammunition stored in the wharf warehouses, and that the fire would spread uncontrollably into the wharf or the Harbin Maru, creating a catastrophe, they sent ships to tow the Bombay Maru to the Jiangmian area near Gaoqiaosha to anchor. At the same time, the Customs fireboat and the Japanese Navy's fire extinguishers assisted in the rescue, but due to the excessive amount of ammunition inside the ship, it was difficult to extinguish it for a while.</p>
<h3>Continuing Explosions</h3>
<p>The ship has been burning since yesterday afternoon, for over thirty hours, and the flames have not subsided. Initially, only a portion was burning, but later the entire ship was engulfed. It couldn't be extinguished by spraying water, so the Japanese army let it burn. Even at noon today, the ammunition inside had not finished burning, so there were still extremely loud explosions at noon. After investigation, it was found that the large artillery shells and airplane bombs loaded on the ship had caught fire and exploded. Consequently, the fire re-ignited intensely in the afternoon. The interior of the ship, including the inner deck cabins and machinery, was completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>Additional Transport Ships Dispatched</h3>
<p>The Japanese troops in Shanghai were urgently awaiting transport to Japan. After the fire on the "Bombay Maru," it was confirmed yesterday that the entire ship was destroyed, including the engine, which was also blown up, leaving only an empty hull. The ship's losses are at least 400,000 yuan. This ship belonged to the Japanese mail company and was requisitioned by the Ministry of the Army. The military supplies destroyed in the explosion were worth over 100,000 yuan. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese Ministry of the Army urgently dispatched the "Tokiwa Maru" to Shanghai to replace the "Bombay Maru" in transporting Japanese troops back home. The withdrawing units are expected to leave Shanghai in the next two days. Yesterday, military supplies were still being loaded at the Huangpu Wharf.</p>

<h3>Various Patriotic Associations Oppose Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>Correcting the British Residents' Association's Proposed Declaration</p>
<p>The Shanghai United Association of Patriotic Organizations' declaration opposing Japan's collusion with foreign parties to undermine Shanghai's territorial sovereignty states: Since the September 18th Incident in 1931, the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, which all nations have adhered to, have been completely violated by the tyrannical Japan. Fortunately, world justice has not been completely extinguished, and friendly nations are still able to uphold fairness, so that the tyrannical Japan's territorial ambitions in the Eastern Provinces and Shanghai dare not be openly displayed. However, because the tyrannical Japan is constrained by the aforementioned international treaties, and its violent seizures cannot take effect in law, it is bound to use all sorts of insidious tricks to collude with a small number of foreign residents in Shanghai to conspire to promote a round table conference to establish a so-called free city. Enlightened friends from friendly nations will certainly not be used or swayed by them. However, we have recently seen reports that a British man named Huthwaite, in the name of the British Residents' Association, sent a letter to the chambers of commerce of various countries, intending to encourage the governments of various countries to convene a round table conference to resolve the future status of Shanghai. Disregarding international treaties, it is as狂暴 (wild and violent) as Japan. Our association believes that such propaganda is the greatest regret for Sino-British friendship. Shanghai is the Shanghai of the Chinese people. Except for the clauses stipulated in the Yangjingbang Regulations, the integrity and independence of its administrative sovereignty must not be violated by anyone. Not only is there the highest international charter, Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, to guarantee this, but also the clear provisions of Articles 1, 2, and 4 of the Nine-Power Treaty stipulate that the governments and people of all countries cannot agree or negotiate or understand in a way that infringes upon our country's territorial sovereignty. Recent resolutions of the League of Nations and the Hoover Doctrine of the United States all take this as their principle. We believe that British residents who advocate justice cannot obliterate this international charter and tarnish their reputation in the world. Moreover, during the riots in Shanghai in 1862, when foreigners used the excuse of the riots to advocate the establishment of a free city, the British Minister Bruce strongly refuted it based on international law and shelved the proposal. Who would have thought that ten years later, the advocate for the establishment of a free city would come from the British residents? This is certainly a small number of people who have been deceived by the tyrannical Japan, and we cannot but sigh for the British residents. As for the reasons given by Huthwaite, they are: (1) to resolve the management rights of roads built beyond the concession; (2) to eliminate the danger of Chinese troops stationed around Shanghai; (3) to improve the handling of litigation cases in the Special District Court. If a round table conference is not convened, it will be impossible to guarantee the safety of the concession. However, it is not known that the first point he referred to is a local matter. How to deal with it should follow the existing regulations, and there are local authorities to resolve it. How can anyone interfere recklessly without following the proper channels? The second point he referred to is not only harmful to the independence of our country's administrative sovereignty, but also obliterates the fact that the January 28th Incident was caused by the tyrannical Japan using the concession to station troops. If all foreign residents do not forget justice, they should uphold strict standards to punish the tyrannical Japan's destruction of the concession's security, then the peace of the concession will be guaranteed. Instead of doing this, they use the danger of preventing the stationing of Chinese troops as an excuse. May I ask, in the past decades, when have Chinese troops endangered the concession? This kind of pro-tyrannical Japan rhetoric is self-defeating. As for the third point he referred to, it is even more related to our country's sovereignty and does not allow foreign intervention. Moreover, since the establishment of the court, apart from a slight decrease in the income of a few foreign lawyers, there have been no other inconveniences. Our association cherishes our country's territorial sovereignty and especially cherishes various international treaties. If there are those who violate international treaties and endanger our country's territorial sovereignty, we will only maintain justice and fairness and deal with them accordingly. In order to awaken the attention of foreign residents in Shanghai, we hereby declare as follows: (1) The historical significance of the round table conference is for the mother country to deal with colonies. This kind of term insults the independence of our country, and we must not tolerate it. (2) The Shanghai Incident and the Eastern Provinces Incident are the entire problem between China and Japan. It cannot be resolved separately, and how to resolve it, we only trust the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty in law, and we do not know others. (3) Shanghai is Chinese territory, and we oppose any attempt by anyone or any country to change our original administrative organization or administrative methods to infringe upon our sovereignty, especially opposing the round table conference that attempts to create a so-called free city. The above three points are our attitude towards the Shanghai issue. We hope that all enlightened foreign residents will severely correct Mr. Huthwaite's statement, and especially hope that foreign residents who are close to the Japanese will recognize the nature of Japan's atrocities this time and not make the mistake of acting like they are dividing the spoils. If unfortunately a few people are blinded by greed and willingly used by the tyrannical Japan, allowing Mr. Huthwaite's statement to continue to spread, then our association will lead three million people to fight to the death to protect the dignity of international treaties and the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty. Even if Shanghai is reduced to ruins, we will never allow the so-called free city to appear. The seas may dry up and the rocks may crumble, but this will will not change. We hope that Chinese and foreign people will take note of this solemn declaration.</p>
<h3>The Light Emitted by the Meteorite and White Clouds Last Night</h3>
<p>There Was a Thunder-like Sound in the Sky</p>
<p>Regarding the strange and colorful white clouds discovered in the sky over this city last night, according to the North China Daily News yesterday, it was the light emitted by the tail of a meteorite. It lasted for about fifteen minutes. A Chinese police officer witnessed the meteorite, saying that it was about half the size of the full moon, with a white light tinged with pale green. One and a half minutes after its appearance, there was a rumbling sound in the sky, like thunder.</p>
<h3>The Water Company States the Reasons for the Water Meter System</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Water Company's Secretary and General Manager, Walter, states the reasons for the water meter system as follows: Regarding the matter of creating a water meter system to calculate water fees, the Public Works Department approved it last year, and at that time, the Shanghai Property Owners' Association (International Association) and the Shanghai Property Owners' Association (Chinese Association) did not object. Why is it that there are now people propagating that its effect is to increase water fees? The above propaganda is inconsistent with the facts. According to the water meter system, its effect is that users can pay according to the actual amount of water they use, which is definitely not like the current system in homes, where water fees are calculated based on rent. The French Concession and Zhabei both use the water meter system, and this system is also common in the United States. Most European countries also use this system.</p>
<p>Some say that if a certain property is calculated using a water meter, the cost will increase fivefold compared to the current cost. However, according to the amount of water currently used there, compared to the price currently paid, it is actually more than five times higher. This matter has now been clarified. The amount of water used there is not for ordinary household use, so using this matter as the effect of using a water meter is an erroneous inference.</p>
<p>It is currently difficult to predict how much water will be used in any given place. It will only be clear after checking how it goes in the future. Therefore, users do not need to anticipate whether there will be any difficulties. If, in the future, the water fees using the water meter system are much higher than the current monthly fee, the reason should be investigated in detail at that time to provide proof. Moreover, if the property owner or tenant can cooperate with the company, they can always limit the amount of water used to a reasonable level.</p>
<p>The main idea of using a water meter is to avoid the waste of water. Its more distant goal is to be cheaper than the monthly fee system, and there is no extra profit to be made. The extra profit is determined according to the contract signed between the Public Works Department and the Water Company.</p>
<p>Also, some property owners intend to cancel the habit of property owners contracting for the water fees of a piece of property and install separate meters for each tenant when using the water meter system. However, this matter was fully studied when discussing the current water rate. However, according to the water rate before implementation, our company has the right to have the property owner of a piece of property be responsible for the water fees of that piece of property. This is a long-standing habit (and also for the French Concession and Zhabei companies). It is usually handled in this way. There are similar things in the United Kingdom and the United States. In new-style buildings with rented rooms, it is also common to contract for the water fees of each tenant in the name of the property owner. When implementing the new water rate, this situation was changed according to the requirements of some property owners. However, there are still contracts established with property owners. However, property owners have the right to have the company establish contracts with each tenant in any place. If so, the cost of changing the above-mentioned water pipes must be borne by the property owner, and a deposit sufficient to offset the value of the water meter must be deposited with the company. When the property is transferred to others or the water meter is removed, the deposit will be returned. Although the interest on the deposit is equivalent to the interest on the price of the water meter, the extra costs of maintaining the investigation number and collecting payments are subsidized from the water rate. Therefore, having the property owner responsible for the cost of changing water pipes and the deposit seems a bit worse at first, but it will become clear later. The cost of changing water pipes is actually in line with the money saved when the property owner and the company sign a contract. In other words, when the water pipes were originally installed, there was a method of installation that made it possible to establish contracts with each user. This only increased the original price of the water pipes. Furthermore, the extra cost of installing separate water meters for each household will ultimately increase the water price, and its benefits can only be given to a portion of the users. Therefore, it must be fair according to the various clauses listed in the water rate.</p>
<p>Also, property owners can first install a total water meter at each piece of property. According to all statistics and observations, the amount of water used in similar places and houses with similar rents is not the same, and the differences are very large. There is always a special reason for places where the cost of water is too high, so this must be investigated in detail. If the efforts of the company and the property owner to reduce the cost of water are still ineffective, the property owner can still install separate water meters for each user according to the above conditions if they want to do so.</p>
<p>If opinions are sought from various places in the concession, they would likely fully support the water meter system. For example, the Board of Water Commissioners of Petersborough (transliteration) in the United States stated in 1899, "Most users are reasonable water users and do not waste it. Only a few users, due to negligence or waste, release large amounts of water into the sewers. As a result, it will increase the amount of water that should be supplied and the water fees that individuals should bear. Therefore, the loss caused by the waste of water by a few users must be compensated by all residents of the city. If each user installs a water meter, those who waste it must pay for it themselves, and others can be exempted from paying for it. In other words, the water fees of others can be reduced." Also, in the 46th compilation of the annual journal of the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1901, Mr. Trotter Wana (transliteration) said, "Experts in engineering do not need to study the matter of limiting waste of water, and everyone would likely agree that the only way to limit waste is unfortunately that in most towns in the United States, the managers of the waterworks are managed by committees of laymen without expertise, and they often listen to the opinions of the majority who are ignorant." Also, the former general manager of the Paris Waterworks in France said, "Those who use water meters can use the amount of water they want, and the waterworks have permanent and the most accurate supervision. Therefore, users do not pay if they do not use water, and the waterworks can fully collect the price for all the water supplied." Also, in new-style buildings with rented rooms, the feelings of property owners and tenants when using water meters (in European and Western countries, this type of house is similar to a piece of house in China) on this issue, Mr. Hixon (transliteration) wrote a book on the price law of the water meter system of waterworks (in 1918), in which he said, "The total amount of water taken is the responsibility of the property owner. If the tenant wastes it, the property owner will suffer. Therefore, disputes often arise, and it is difficult to create a water meter system. Later, property owners gradually realized that the reason for wasting water was that the water equipment was damaged and leaking, and no one cared about it. Therefore, the water equipment is often repaired so as not to increase the water costs. Moreover, it is difficult to install separate water meters for each room (such as tap water and lights) because of the installation of water pipes, but it cannot be said that it cannot be done, but there is not much benefit." According to what is said above, it can be said that the difficulties of the Shanghai Waterworks are roughly the same as the difficulties of waterworks in other places. Therefore, adopting the water meter system in other places can solve this kind of difficulty, and adopting the water meter system in Shanghai may also achieve the same result.</p>
<p>When discussing the local water problem, attention should be paid to the interests of the shareholders of the waterworks, because their interest is fixed. Therefore, the price of the water sold is directly determined by the total cost of water production and transportation. If the total cost is high, the water price will also be high. If the total number is reduced, the water price will also be reduced accordingly. Therefore, adopting a method of increasing the total cost will directly increase the water price. Therefore, if separate water meters are forcibly installed in each small house, the cost of using water is actually not enough to offset the cost of installing, maintaining, and viewing the water meter. Although this is for the convenience of the property owner, this method is actually not economical, and the result will always increase the public's water burden. In other words, using an uneconomical method will actually cause the entire population to suffer losses.</p>
<p>The city is now divided into several small areas for the purpose of creating a water meter system. This matter has been explained before and does not need to be detailed again. In short, water meters will be installed in each area one after another. When the equipment is completed, water fees will be calculated using the water meter system. The equipment has now been completed in two areas, and new contracts have been sent. Most of the users in these two areas have signed and returned them, but there are also some who are listening to outside announcements and delaying to see what happens. It is hoped that these users will sign and return the new contracts as soon as possible to avoid future disputes. This would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government built civilian housing to improve the lives of ordinary people. Currently, there are 1,233 completed and managed units. The first civilian housing is located on Quanjia'an Road in Zhabei, the second civilian housing is located on Xietu Road in Nanshi, and the third civilian housing is located on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei.

<h3>Two Organizations Telegraph to Request Assistance for the Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>The Shanghai United Association of Patriotic Organizations and the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association telegraphed the military and political authorities of various provinces yesterday, stating: "To the chairmen of the governments of all provinces and the pacification commissioners of all provinces: Since the September 18th Incident, more than 30 million compatriots and 4 million square li of territory in the Northeast have fallen to foreign races. The pain of national subjugation has been personally experienced. Fortunately, Generals Ding Chao, Li Du, and Ma Zhanshan, as well as Wang Delin and other folk heroes, are leading brave soldiers in the midst of difficulties and dangers, fighting to the death. Their spirit of perseverance and their disregard for death are enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods weep. The only hope for our nation's survival depends on this. All Chinese people should rise up and provide assistance. Our associations, despite their meager resources, have united patriotic people from all walks of life in Shanghai to establish the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association. Chu Fucheng, Li Cishan, Zhao Yu, Yin Ruli, Wu Shan, Wang Baozhen, Feng Shaoshan, Lin Yunfan, and Chen Yafu have been elected as managing directors, and Zhu Ziqiao, Xu Jingren, Hu Shuhua, Yin Zhiling, Jiang Wenyu, and Zhang Zilian have been elected as directors. Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Yanpei, Yu Xiji, Zhang Tianzhi, and Hu Fengxiang have been elected as custodians, and Pan Xulun, Bei Zuyi, Lu Jianai, Chen Depei, and Wang Zhisheng have been elected as supervisors. They have been organized and established separately and have started working. Fortunately, we have received donations from all parties, which have enabled us to provide practical support and enable the volunteer armies to fight for a long time. However, a cup of water cannot save a cart of firewood. It is easier to lift with many hands. Therefore, we urge all talented people in the country to enthusiastically contribute and advocate for the masses, so that hundreds of rivers can converge into a huge flood and the whip can be thrown to cut off the flow. Your Excellency is the pillar of China and the guardian of the country. You have always been enthusiastic about resisting Japan and saving the country. We dare to ask for practical assistance and also encourage the local political and business circles to raise as much money as possible. It is seen that a call will be made and all mountains will respond, directly benefiting the Northeast Volunteer Army, and indirectly protecting the country. We are looking forward to good news on the horizon. The Shanghai United Association of Patriotic Organizations and the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association bow in unison."</p>

<h3>Burmese Overseas Chinese Volunteer Team Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Burmese Overseas Chinese National Salvation Volunteer Team, consisting of 60 members, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the British mail ship "Karma". They landed at 5:30 p.m. and brought with them all the yellow uniforms and sneakers of the volunteer army, looking very heroic. They then walked to the city and temporarily stayed in Chongwu House. The text of their telegram is recorded below (titles omitted): "All respectfully acknowledge that the Japanese disregard international law and undermine world peace. Sending troops to forcibly occupy our Eastern Provinces is already a public enemy of the world. How can we endure the fact that they have become even more aggressive and dare to send planes and warships to bomb Shanghai, the transportation hub and economic center of our country? Our 19th Route Army resolutely resisted with force for the sake of national survival and national self-defense. In the blink of an eye, they repeatedly defeated strong enemies and the good news spread. All overseas Chinese cheered. Although our team is far away in Burma, we are angered by the tyranny of the Japanese invaders and saddened by the massacre of our compatriots. Our chest-filling aspiration is a matter of duty. In addition to organizing the Burmese Overseas Chinese Youth League National Salvation Volunteer Team, it was established immediately and set off to return to the country to kill the enemy. We hope that all the ruling officials and armed comrades in the country will unite against foreign enemies. We would rather be shattered jade than complete tiles. Our team dares to be the vanguard and vows to be the government's backing. We respectfully report our humble intentions and hope that you will take note of them. The Burmese Overseas Chinese Youth National Salvation Volunteer Team Leader, He Senli, and all team members bow in unison."</p>
<h3>Exemption of Telephone and Water Fees within the Hongkou Area</h3>
<p>Streets Like Ghost Towns During the War</p>
<p>No Usage, Of Course, No Fee</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday sent a letter to the Public Works Department, requesting that telephone and water fees in the Hongkou district during the war be exempted and asking for consultations with relevant companies. The letter stated: "Respectfully, we received a letter from the temporary office of the various district branches of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation in Hongkou, stating that since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, the entire city has been closed down, and financial institutions have ceased operations. Residents in the war zone have either perished in the artillery fire and blood-soaked fields or fled for their lives, enduring unspeakable suffering. Even residents of the concession enjoying the protection of the Public Works Department's police force, such as those in the Hongkou district, have been occupied by the Japanese army since the beginning of the Shanghai Incident. The entire district has fallen into chaos, enduring the ravages of war as if it were a war zone. Moreover, they have suffered even more from the killings and destruction by the Japanese army. During the war, the footprints of Chinese people in our Hongkou and other areas have disappeared, and the city streets are like ghost towns. These facts are widely seen and heard by both Chinese and foreigners. Now that the troop withdrawal agreement has been initially reached, residents are gradually gathering. However, the difficulties ahead are great, and recovery will not be easy. Therefore, our association and others advocate that during the war, since telephones and water were mostly unused, their fees should be exempted for one season altogether. This is the minimum requirement and not an unreasonable request. We have already informed the various branches to notify their members to suspend payment until a result of the negotiation is reached, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and maintain the market." Upon investigation, the statements in the letter are indeed unavoidable facts. The motive for waiving donations and rents also lies in this. Logically, no fee should be paid if there is no usage.</p>

<p>z　　　　methods (but due to the fee　　　　　the reason for using the exemption is 　　　for the sake of fairness, please　　　your kind assistance in consulting with relevant companies. Sincerely, to the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>Long Unresolved Labor Dispute at the Shishi Xinbao Newspaper</h3>
<p>Since April 2nd, the authorities of the Shanghai Shishi Xinbao newspaper, citing the "Da Wanbao" incident as a pretext, have dismissed a large number of workers without cause. It has been two months, and the attitude of the employer towards the laid-off workers remains stubbornly unchanged. Feeling that there is no hope of resolution and under the pressure of life, they all went to the residence of Zhang Zhuping, the chairman of the newspaper, yesterday morning (22nd) to petition. At that time, Zhang was still asleep. The workers submitted a petition and waited for a long time before he instructed them to send representatives to talk. At that time, Zhang said that he understood the intentions of the gentlemen and others, but the words "return to work" were difficult to accept. He himself was only one of the directors of the newspaper and had no right to interfere with the newspaper's administration. The gentlemen and others could ask the labor union to negotiate with the newspaper's manager themselves. He then instructed the driver to pick up the newspaper's manager, Xiong Shaohao, and asked him to be responsible for negotiating with the labor union. The workers' representatives, believing that Zhang had agreed to negotiate, withdrew and reported to the labor union, requesting that representatives be sent to negotiate with the newspaper. It is said that the labor union immediately sent five responsible representatives to meet with the newspaper's manager, Xiong Shaohao. Unexpectedly, when the newspaper's manager met with the labor union representatives, he secretly reported to the police station to send detectives to closely monitor them, as if facing a formidable enemy. Although the labor union representatives argued based on reason, the newspaper still evasively defended itself, without any result.</p>
<h3>Yu Bolu's Appeal Case Scheduled for Trial</h3>
<p>Yu Bolu, the former district chief of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who ordered police officers Lin Qingxiang, Liu Weicheng, Wu Zhanyou, and others to open fire on Baoshan Road in front of the district, killing civilians, was sentenced by the District Court. Yu and the police officers were each given a reduced sentence of two years and six months imprisonment and allowed temporary bail. Now, Yu Bolu and others, dissatisfied with the sentence, have appealed to the High Court. The High Court has scheduled the hearing for 1:00 PM on June 6th and has ordered the District Court to subpoena the defendants and witnesses to appear in court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Over Eighty Boxes of Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Discovered by Water Patrol</p>
<p>Boatmen Repeatedly Evade Responsibility</p>
<p>Around 10:00 PM the night before last, a large sand barge suddenly docked at the waters off Wusongkou. Soon after, a pier boat and a rowboat sped in from the outer harbor and docked alongside the sand barge. This was spotted by Wu Minzhen, a sergeant of the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who was patrolling the river. He saw that the pier boat and rowboat were loaded with a large number of wooden boxes, and the crew members were suspiciously transferring the boxes onto the sand barge. Suspecting foul play, he boarded the sand barge and conducted a search. He found two rifles in the cabin and pried open the wooden boxes one by one. Upon inspection, he found that they were filled with bullets. Believing that it involved the smuggling of a large quantity of military supplies, he seized the rifles, the sand barge, the rowboat, and the pier boat, along with more than eighty wooden boxes containing approximately 61,000 bullets. He also arrested the sand barge's crew members Zhang Gaohua, Zhang Xiaoqing, Chen Lin, and the rowboat's crew members Shang Qingyu, Zhang Xiaozhi, and others. When Liang, the chief captain, conducted a preliminary hearing, Tao Liufa and Chen Guangzai confessed that the wooden boxes were entrusted to them by a customer named Chen Xiangfu for transportation. Zhang Gaohua, Zhang Xiaoqing, Chen Lin, Shang Qingyu, and Zhang Xiaozhi all claimed that the wooden boxes were hired by a customer surnamed Wang in Wusongzhen to be transported to this location and unloaded onto the sand barge, and that they did not know that they contained military supplies, pleading for leniency. They were ordered to prepare documents to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Origin of the Loud Noise on Fuzhou Road</h3>
<p>Around 2:00 PM yesterday, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was testing gunpowder cartridges for cannons in the drill hall on Fourth Avenue. They accidentally detonated one, and because the room was quite large, the sound was especially loud, causing nearby listeners to be surprised.</p>
<h3>The Ephemeral "Security Donation Company" in the French Concession</h3>
<p>The Security Company Cannot Provide Security</p>
<p>The French Authorities Insist on Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>The reemergence just the day before yesterday (the 22nd) of the "Security Donation Company" in the French Concession, suddenly discovered behind No. 8 Bu Nian Li on Rue du Consulat, almost shattered the quiet atmosphere of the French Concession in recent months and cast doubt on the resolute will that the French Concession authorities had always held. However, after the incident was revealed by this newspaper yesterday, the Chief of Police, Fébvre, immediately sent personnel to conduct a secret investigation and confirm the facts. Then, around 10:00 AM, he specially dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to search and arrest the perpetrators. Ten employees of the fake company were arrested on the spot, and more than ten account books and many national emblems and documents were seized. The signboard of the "Security Company" at the entrance was pried off and taken to the police station. After the head of the police questioned them one by one in detail, he ordered them to be detained separately to await trial in the Special Court. Since the case occurred, there has been much public discussion, with some saying that unscrupulous people were collecting money under false pretenses and others saying that negotiations had not yet taken place. Although these are just unfounded rumors, it is an undeniable fact that the French Concession has been strictly enforcing the ban on opium in recent months. Now, in the midst of this strict prohibition, such an illegal company has been established, and the location of its establishment is just a stone's throw from the police station in Bu Nian Li. It is said that the authorities attach great importance to this case and insist on a thorough investigation in order to get to the bottom of the matter.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Homicide in a Kitchen</h3>
<p>Qing Wu's Life Story Fragmented</p>
<p>West District and Zhang Engaged in Deadly Fight</p>
<p>Zhang Fu (also known as Zhang Fulang), who lived in the kitchen of No. 392 Chongqing Road in the New Concession, and the woman Zhang Wu retired to bed on the twelfth of this month at ten o'clock. The following morning they still had not stirred. At four o'clock in the afternoon, Zhang's friend Wang Heshang discovered Zhang dead on the floor in the room, while Zhang Wu was still lying unconscious in bed. The room was extremely messy, with broken bowls scattered on the floor. The responsible New Concession Police Station, upon receiving the report, sent detectives to transport the deceased to the morgue, where it was determined that he had died from injuries sustained in an attack. The woman was sent to the hospital for diagnosis. When she regained consciousness, she was transferred to the First Special District Court. Interrogation yielded no results, and she was ordered to be detained for further investigation. These details have already been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the woman is over forty years old and not particularly attractive. She originally lived with her husband, Mr. Wu, in Anting. Unfortunately, Mr. Wu died of illness in his hometown on September 1st of last year. The woman became a widow, and within two months, her son also passed away, leaving her with only two daughters, one fifteen years old and one eleven years old. Due to poverty, it was difficult to survive. The woman brought her two daughters to Shanghai last winter to make a living. She was introduced to work for the Du family at No. 66 Hehefang. Her two daughters, both petite and lively, were loved by their employer and were also kept as maids. Since then, they have not had to worry about hunger and cold. Around the first month of the lunar calendar, a hairdresser named A'er used her eloquent tongue to introduce Zhang Fulang, a Chongming native from the Wufuzhai pastry shop on Rue Guillaumme Brenier in the French Concession, to live with the woman. Zhang, who was about the same age as Wu, was like a thirsty man meeting water, while Wu was a newly widowed woman. After A'er's persuasion, they quickly became inseparable and rented a kitchen at No. 392 Chongqing Road to realize their love. Zhang had been a clerk at Wudingzhai for four years, earning a monthly salary of twelve yuan, which was more than enough for his personal expenses. After living with Wu, he inevitably felt that his income was not enough. In order to increase his income, he hired a substitute to replace him at the pastry shop, while Zhang and Wu set up a noodle stall on the side of the street. They had just started operating on the twelfth of this month when, unexpectedly, this unofficial couple did not embrace each other when they went to bed the next night. According to Wu's statement to the police station after regaining consciousness, she and Zhang had finished washing their feet and went to bed at ten o'clock on the thirteenth night. About an hour later, she heard someone calling Zhang's name outside the room in her dream. She got out of bed and opened the door, and suddenly saw two people rush in and beat Zhang severely. At that time, she was so shocked that she fainted and did not know anything about being arrested and so on. Now her nerves have fully recovered, and she denies having had a fight with Zhang Fulang. The head of the police sent detectives to investigate the other residents of the house, who all said that they had not heard any movement in the kitchen that night, and that the back door of the house had been tightly closed from 12:00 AM on the thirteenth night to 5:00 AM the next morning. If someone had entered from the outside, they would have had to pick the lock. After the police investigation, they concluded that the woman's statement was difficult to believe, and based on the messy state of the room, it was likely that they had fought with each other. Therefore, they charged the woman with the crime of assault leading to death in the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng interrogated her. First, Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, presented the case, followed by a Western detective who reported on the investigation. Then, the second landlord of the house, surnamed Jiao, and a fellow resident, Wang Shigui, testified that they had not heard any noise in the kitchen that night. Afterwards, Judge Feng questioned the defendant, Zhang Wu, who recounted the entire story of bringing her daughters to Shanghai to work as maids and her subsequent union with Zhang Fulang. Later, when her eleven-year-old daughter was also brought to the court, the woman was overwhelmed by the misery of her life and burst into tears. Judge Feng, believing that the case still required investigation, ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Fukushima Departs Shanghai Today</h3>

It is said that Fukushima is scheduled to leave Shanghai for his home country on Tuesday of this week.</p>
<h3>Chen Shuren Prepares for American Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>To Be Held in Berlin</p>
<p>A reporter from the Riri News Agency interviewed Chinese Committee Member Chen Shuren at his residence in Beijing and learned that Chen and others are preparing for the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition and Mr. Chen's solo exhibition, which will be held in China and abroad in the near future.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Chinese Art　Mr. Chen said that Chinese art is broad and profound, and is sufficient to represent the characteristics of Eastern culture. It is indeed praised by Europeans and Americans. After the Belgian Exposition two years ago, the only art that was praised more was French, then Belgian, then Chinese. This proves the importance of the status of Chinese art in the international arena. Last spring, the Chinese artist Liu Haisu held a Chinese modern exhibition at the University of Frankfurt in Germany, and then moved it to the exhibition hall in Heidelberg in the summer, arousing Europeans' deep attention to Chinese art. Because at the beginning of the spring of that year, the Japanese had held a large-scale exhibition in Berlin, but most of the works in it were made to cater to Europeans, so Europeans felt that Japanese art was merely superficially Europeanized and did not see its unique strengths. When they saw Chinese modern art, they were surprised and praised it, and all newspapers competed to praise it, winning a lot of honor.</p>
<p>Motivation for the Berlin Exhibition At that time, the person in charge of the Chinese Embassy in Germany suddenly felt the need for China to hold a Chinese art exhibition in Berlin, and formally agreed with the German National Art Academy to hold a large-scale Chinese art exhibition at the Berlin National Art Academy in February 1934. The German side has elected ten committee members who are all famous figures in the country's art world. On the Chinese side, the Minister of Education, the President of the Academia Sinica, the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, and Liu Haisu, Ye Gongchuo, and I were initially appointed as committee members. The other six members will be appointed after the Ministry of Education and the Academia Sinica jointly form a preparatory committee. The Chinese Embassy in Germany once sent a detailed account of the reasons by telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Academia Sinica. Later, it was decided that the Ministry of Education and the Academia Sinica would be responsible for handling the matter, and it was requested that the Executive Yuan allocate funds for preparation. At that time, Mr. Liu and I would be given the opportunity to go to Berlin in person, if possible, and we also planned to transfer to Paris and London to exhibit and promote them, so that foreigners would have a more refined understanding of Chinese art. Regarding the method of collecting exhibits, we are preparing to widely collect the works of famous artists in the country, so as to form a spectacular exhibition, with the aim of creating a unique bloom of Chinese art in the world.</p>
<p>Solo Art Exhibition　I held a solo art exhibition in Guangzhou last year. It lasted for five days, and more than 50,000 people visited it. All the exhibits were eagerly sought after by the viewers. Although I politely declined to sell them because I was reluctant to part with them, the enthusiasts insisted on buying them. In the end, I reluctantly sold more than 20 pieces, worth about 10,000 yuan, but the best ones were not sold. At that time, the consuls of various countries in Guangzhou and foreigners paid special attention to them, and some even came early to request a special opening for one hour. The newspapers in Hong Kong and Guangzhou all published special editions dedicated to this news, which shows that Chinese and Westerners have a very strong interest in appreciating Chinese modern art. For the sake of popularizing the introduction, I plan to transport all my works, more than 100 pieces, from Guangdong to Beijing after the plum rain season, and then hold an official exhibition in the capital, and then go to Shanghai and then to Peiping, each place exhibiting for five days. These exhibits are the result of my years of experience in the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River basins, and all the local landscapes and customs are incorporated into the paintings, especially the Guilin landscapes in Guangxi. My move is not to seek fame or praise, but to arouse the interest of Chinese people in art research. As for the effect and evaluation, I will transport them to Europe and the United States for phased exhibitions, because art is enough to promote the true spirit of the nation and express the inherent culture of the country.</p>
<h3>The World of National Doctor Gao Qiupu</h3>
<p>National doctor Gao Qiupu from Gaojiazhai, south of Tangqiao Town in Pudong, is a student of Cao Ziyun, a famous doctor from Pudong. He has assisted in diagnoses for many years and has profound medical skills. He has insights into both internal and external departments. Yesterday was the day of his medical practice, and the halls were filled with congratulatory guests. Many people from political, business, and medical circles came to congratulate him, saying that he could be trusted to benefit the people.</p>
<h3>Ding Xingzi Sentenced for Stabbing His Aunt to Death</h3>
<p>To Serve Eleven Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Ding Xingzi from Yangzhou, resenting that his wife, Mao Guiying, a woman from Hubei, was introduced by his aunt Gao Xushi (also known as Xu Huiqing) to have a relationship with a certain adjutant, which caused Guiying to want to break away from her relationship with him and used the excuse of entering the church for spiritual cultivation, took advantage of his drunkenness at noon on the 3rd of this month and stabbed Gao Xushi in the abdomen with a knife in the pavilion of his house at No. 195 Dong Youheng Road, which led to her death after unsuccessful medical treatment. Mao Guiying and her mother, Mao Gao, were also stabbed in the forehead and hands. Ding was arrested by Liu Zhaonian, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and sentencing. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the first trial, and Ding Xingzi was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for the crime of murder, seven years of imprisonment for killing a collateral relative, and five years of imprisonment for the crime of attempted murder. He should serve eleven years of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the final judgment will be offset by two days of imprisonment for one day. The murder weapon, a knife, was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Fire Log</h3>
<p>Yangshupu Bridge　Yesterday evening at 6:00 PM, a stove room at Xiangtai Timber Company near Yangshupu Bridge suddenly went out of control, burning a lot of wood and pine boards, and destroying a house. The fire brigade rushed to the scene and tried its best to put out the fire. It was extinguished after half an hour. The estimated loss is about 500 taels.</p>
<p>Lu Road　At 5:45 PM yesterday afternoon, a fire suddenly broke out at Sheng Dachang Paper Store at No. 54 Rue du Consulat in the French Concession. It spread to the neighboring Wang Dachang Cigarette and Paper Store at No. 52, Zhida Chaiyue Store at No. 50, and a certain Dabing Shop at No. 48. The French Concession Fire Brigade rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which was not extinguished until 7:30 PM. A total of four municipal houses were burned, with an estimated loss of about 6,000 yuan. The arsonist was arrested on the spot by the constable and taken to the French Police Station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Renji Hospital Second Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>The new building of the Ningbo Renji Hospital has been completed and the opening ceremony is scheduled for June 16th, as reported earlier. It is now learned that Yu Runquan, Tu Yunsheng, Wu Quansong, and other gentlemen from the Ningbo Preparatory Office of the hospital have come to Shanghai to discuss the preparations. Yesterday, the second preparatory meeting was held at the Ningbo Association in Shanghai to proceed with all the opening matters separately by the Shanghai and Ningbo preparatory offices.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Shareholders' Meeting of Dongfang Nianhong Electric Light Company</h3>
<p>Dongfang Nianhong Electric Light Partnership Company held its second shareholders' meeting at 2:00 PM on the 23rd on the ninth floor of the YMCA in the Shanghai Concession. A total of five unlimited liability shareholders and twenty-five limited liability shareholders attended, totaling 5,260 shares, exceeding the majority. Therefore, the shareholders present unanimously elected Mr. Ren Shigang as the temporary chairman and Mr. Mao Tifei as the recorder. The company's business operations and current situation for the 20th year were reported, followed by a report on the business by General Manager Mr. Chen Junwu and a report on the accounts by Manager Mr. Zhang Huikang. Accountant Dong Weicheng was also invited to attend in person to certify the authenticity of the financial statements and the good business performance. All the shareholders were satisfied. Because the company's factory was located in Zhabei and suffered heavy losses from floods during the war, fortunately, the surplus from the previous session could be used to make up for the losses. Therefore, after discussion by the majority of shareholders, the surplus was retained and no dividends were distributed this year, to be disposed of in the next session.

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I have recently read in the local news section of your esteemed newspaper about the discovery of a large batch of military supplies at No. 2, Lane 29, Fushantang Street. Upon investigation, there has been absolutely no such incident at our four houses. It is actually a mistake concerning No. 5, Southern Head, Sheep Intestine Lane, north of our location, belonging to Delu. As this concerns our reputation, I am writing to request that this letter be published in the "Letters to the Editor" section to correct the error, in order to avoid misunderstandings. Yours sincerely, Wang Zhuojun, May 23.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Regarding the item in the Shanghai Municipal Council's administrative records published in your newspaper on the 20th of this month concerning the waterworks investigation, there is a sentence stating that the Director of Public Works found it "inconvenient to add criticisms" to the experts' report. Please note that "add criticisms" should read "add opinions". I am writing to request that you kindly make the correction. Yours sincerely, Information Office, Shanghai Municipal Council, May 23, 1932.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>According to Mr. Li Guangqin, the manager of the Jingzu Office of the Qian Yuan Industrial Company, I have recently read a news report in various newspapers about the Public Security Bureau seizing military supplies, which is inconsistent with the facts. This morning, the gatekeeper of Xinming Lane, Shen Zhubing, reported to me that six boxes of heavy objects, large and small, were discovered under the stairs in an empty house at No. 27, Miaoqiao Road, and he did not know what they were. I immediately went with him to investigate and reported the matter to the Chenjiaqiao Police Station. Police officer Sun Changrong came and used an iron tool to open the boxes, which contained prohibited military supplies. The police station then sent Chief Liu and other officers to transport the prohibited items to the bureau to avoid danger. The details reported in the news are mostly inaccurate. I have been asked by a lawyer to write to request a correction. I am writing on behalf of my client to request that your newspaper publish a correction to ensure accuracy. Yours sincerely, Zhou Shi Bi, Lawyer, May 23.</p>

<h3>Important News: National Compilation and Translation Bureau Improves Textbooks</h3>
<p>Engaging in Translation Work</p>
<p>Researching Natural Sciences</p>
<p>After the organizational regulations of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau were promulgated by the Ministry of Education, the internal organization has been largely determined. The following is a selection of the bureau's recent work and future plans: (1) Improving primary and secondary school textbooks. Although primary and secondary school textbooks have been reviewed in the past, it is now felt that they are not entirely suitable and that standards need to be revised and improved. The plan is to invite experts to critique the textbooks that have already been reviewed, select the better ones among the published books, conduct in-depth research, consider the pros and cons, and make supplements to improve them. It is also hoped that those who edit textbooks will not be bound by the standards set by the Ministry of Education, but will instead be divinely inspired, so as not to be as rigid as the eight-legged essays of the imperial examination era. Some aspects of improvement can be mentioned briefly, such as the scope of analysis of geology and minerals. In the past, secondary school textbooks provided detailed descriptions of minerals, but little research on geology. In fact, our travels through mountains and rivers, our archaeological studies of the past and present, make the study of geology even more necessary. It is heard that the bureau has invited Dr. Wang Gongmu to preside over the research on geology and minerals. As for history, the bureau plans to compile textbooks of extended length for university use. By shortening the long version, it can be used as a secondary school textbook, and by further shortening the secondary school textbook, it can be used as a primary school textbook. This cycle can also be consistent. It is heard that this compilation will be presided over by Messrs. Fu Sinian, Gu Jiegang, and Zheng Hesheng. (2) Translation work. This translation work has little foundation. Since the establishment of the Translation Committee, considerable work has been done. It is heard that, in order to be cautious about pharmaceutical terminology, Mr. Weng Zhilong will review it in detail before it can be published. Mr. Zheng Zhenwen is working on chemistry and plans to review it at the chemistry conference during the summer vacation. Physics is being organized. Biology is currently in the preliminary stages of work. (3) The bureau plans to contact university professors and specialized personnel to compile basic science textbooks for secondary schools and universities in the field of natural sciences, such as science. In the field of social sciences, it plans to compile and introduce more about international politics and international economics. It is heard that the bureau plans to appoint Mr. Chen Kezhong and Mr. Tong Guanxian as the heads of natural sciences and social sciences, respectively.</p>

<h3>Jinan University Recovers Zhenru Campus</h3>
<p>Inspecting and Photographing Each Location for Sealing</p>
<p>Strict Entrance Control, Striving to Restore Order</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese troops withdrew from Zhenru, and the area was taken over by the Shanghai Ceasefire Zone Reception Committee. The most important institution in the area is National Jinan University. Therefore, at 9:00 AM yesterday, the university sent more than ten members of the university's Post-War Reconstruction Committee, including Fan Shouzhi, Yang Yufen, Zhang Tianfang, Lin Zhiying, and faculty and staff, to receive the campus with the Reception Committee. It was found that all the school buildings and equipment were badly damaged, especially the science building, which was destroyed by Japanese aircraft, resulting in even greater losses on the right side. After taking over, the university immediately raised the flag of the Kuomintang and the national flag, inspected and photographed each location for future reference, and sealed them separately. In accordance with the Reconstruction Committee, a plan for reconstruction and restoration was drafted and implemented step by step. In order to ensure strict entrance control, the school gate and the surrounding areas were guarded by police officers. Any faculty or students returning to the Zhenru campus for observation must first obtain a temporary pass from the Shanghai campus and present it to the police for verification before entering. Moreover, no one is allowed to take any items out of the campus at this time. They will be temporarily handed over to the custodians for safekeeping and returned at a later date. It is estimated that the restoration work will take two months to restore the original condition. In addition, President Zheng of the university also visited the campus for an inspection at noon on the same day and gave detailed instructions on the restoration matters.</p>
<h3>Shanghai University Scheduled to Move Back to Yangshupu</h3>
<p>Shanghai University, formerly located on Jungong Road, changed to opening and holding classes in the city center district due to the inconvenient transportation during the extraordinary situation. Now that the transportation in the area has been restored, and the school buildings and equipment have fortunately remained unscathed after this turmoil, for the convenience of students studying, the University Affairs Administration Committee has decided to move the university department back to the Yangshupu campus on June 1st, while adhering to the original policy of emphasizing strict training and guiding students to balance academic pursuits and saving the country.</p>
<h3>China Women's Physical Education Teachers College Moves Campus</h3>
<p>The China Women's Physical Education Teachers College moved to Foch Road after being affected by the war. Now that the number of students in the school has increased and the school buildings are insufficient, the school has rented a Western-style house at No. 517, Jufanda Road to move in and hold classes. It is also heard that the school still has surplus space, which is very suitable for schools and institutions to sublet.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Primary and Secondary Schools Set Up Branch Schools</h3>
<p>The school building of the private Guangdong Primary and Secondary School in this city, located next to the Commercial Press factory, was directly hit during the January 28th Incident, and all the school buildings and property were reduced to ashes, resulting in a loss of more than 200,000 yuan. Principal Chen Hongbi was disheartened by the destruction of his achievements of many years in one day. Later, Wen Qinfu and school directors Wu Yaoting and Wang Yunwu made every effort to maintain it, and were able to temporarily resume classes at Changfengli, Tongfu Road. Among them, Ms. Yueqin, the wife of Wu Yaoting, was the most enthusiastic. Because the existing school buildings were not sufficient and were far from the western district and the Hongkou area, many children of Cantonese people were unable to attend school due to the distance. Ms. Yueqin temporarily lent her original Western-style apartment on Laobazi Road for use as a branch school of the school, so as to avoid students' long journeys and to promote the development of the school. Someone had offered to rent the apartment from Ms. Yueqin for 150 taels, but Ms. Yueqin refused and instead sacrificed her own interests to benefit the students. It is heard that Principal Chen Hongbi is actively preparing to open the school as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Temple Bell Ringing Records (IV) Not Removing Courtyard Grass Studio</h3>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>The stars in the sky are constantly moving. Every day, they rise from the east, pass through the meridian where I stand, and head west. I compared the clepsydra with the stars and saw something very strange. I took a large bamboo tube, two feet long, with both ends open. At the outer end, I used a silk thread to make a diameter and glued it tightly to the tube to divide the tube opening into three semicircles. Then I placed this bamboo tube on a frame with the silk thread aligned with the meridian, so that the bamboo tube could be turned up and down. When a star approached the meridian, I turned the bamboo tube up and down to aim at the star. When the star reached the silk thread, I checked which grid the water in the clepsydra had dripped to. Strangely, in fifteen days, this star reached the meridian one hour earlier. In one month, it reached the meridian two hours earlier. In twelve months, it reached the meridian twenty-four hours earlier.</p>
<p>At first, I suspected that there was something wrong with the clepsydra. Later, a tourist stayed in our temple for seven days. He brought a round and flat monster. He said that this monster was called a watch. The short hand rotated once every half day for twelve hours, and the long hand rotated once every hour for sixty minutes, without any error. I used the watch to track the time when the Tian Shu star of the Big Dipper passed through the centerline of the bamboo tube opening every day. I found that the Tian Shu star passed through four minutes earlier each day. This was consistent with the result of comparing it with the clepsydra. It was four minutes earlier each day, which was exactly one hour in half a month. Later, another guest brought a more sophisticated watch that could report every minute and every second. After testing this thing for a few days, I found that each star reached the meridian three minutes and fifty-six seconds earlier on the second night than on the first night. Multiplying this number by the number of days in a year, 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds, it was almost a total of twenty-four hours earlier.</p>
<p>Why am I being so long-winded? Because the reason why my evening bell can be rung on time is entirely due to this point. First, I look north to find the Big Dipper. Then, I find the Tian Shu and Tian Xuan stars in the Big Dipper. If the handle of the Dipper is pointing to the right, Tian Shu and Tian Xuan are on the far left, with Tian Xuan in the south and Tian Shu in the north. Then, I draw a line from Tian Xuan to Tian Shu and extend it five times longer to encounter the North Star near the North Pole. Then, I use the North Star as the center to observe the rotation of the line connecting Tian Shu and Tian Xuan to estimate the twenty-four solar terms of the year and the twenty-four hours of the day. For convenience, I took a large iron ring that a child plays with and used twelve lines to make the twelve diameters of the iron ring, each intersecting at the center of the ring at equal angles. These twelve intersecting lines divide the iron ring into twenty-four equal parts, each equal part being fifteen degrees. I draw "a direction" every fifteen degrees, for a total of twenty-four directions. The four cardinal directions are east, south, west, and north. Then, I align the intersection point of the ring center with the North Star and make the north and south points coincide with the meridian. Then! East is on the right hand, and west is on the left hand. Then, I see which direction in the ring the line connecting Tian Shu and Tian Xuan falls on. As long as I know what solar term it is, I know what time it is. As long as I know what time it is, I know what solar term it is. For example, at 8:00 PM, the line connecting Tian Shu and Tian Xuan is in the southeast during the vernal equinox, then it is due south during the beginning of summer, southwest during the summer solstice, due west during the beginning of autumn, northwest during the autumnal equinox, due north during the beginning of winter, and northeast during the winter solstice. The same is true for this estimation. The stars travel fifteen degrees per hour, and move one hundred and twenty degrees every eight hours. If it is in the south at 8:00 PM, it will definitely be thirty degrees west of north at 4:00 AM. As each day passes, the stars, including the Big Dipper, are in the far north and not easy to see, so I use Wang Liang as a replacement. It reaches the meridian three minutes and fifty-six seconds earlier. If observed at a fixed time, this star moves less than one degree (more than fifty-nine minutes) from east to south to west. It moves fifteen degrees every solar term. Therefore, the time for ringing the bell every night is determined by the position of the stars. Everyone must be a little impatient. I have said all this just to show that I dare not be negligent in the slightest when entrusted by everyone to perform this bell-ringing duty. I know that my method, strictly speaking in astronomical terms! It still cannot be regarded as the most accurate. But within the realm of possibility, this country child has tried his best. Of course, I am still pursuing the most accurate way to ring the bell.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Education After the January 28th Incident (IX) Still</h3>
<h3>XIV. Educating Refugees</h3>
<p>The discovery of traitors is invariably due to the hardships of people's livelihood and the effect of ignorance. If we have statistics on traitors, we can prove that if we patiently guide them, it is not difficult to save them. People are not wood or stone. How can they clearly understand the great path and willingly be slaves and plunge their descendants into eternal destruction? The Shanghai Education Bureau, in view of the fact that most of the refugees in various shelters are adults who have lost their education and children who have no occupation, are easily prone to idleness and bad habits, iron errors in their thinking, and enter into misunderstandings. It is not difficult to be without them. Therefore, a "Refugee Education Committee" was organized to remind the displaced compatriots of their patriotism and to make them recognize the "nation as an eternal and immortal state" as said by the German patriotic philosopher, to provide spiritual training, and to cultivate the hearts of the people. In addition, efforts are made to implement general education, literacy teaching, and the inculcation of common sense.</p>
<p>The Refugee Education Committee was established in mid-February, with a total of twelve members. They prepared a sum of money and did the grassroots work in a practical manner. They found that there were as many as eighty-two refugee shelters in Shanghai, with more than 2,700 disaster victims. The twelve members used their spare time to prepare suitable educational materials and published three-color day reports. They took the teaching materials and went to the shelters to teach the refugees. On average, each person could visit two shelters per day, and the teaching time was about one or two hours each time. Every week in the morning, the members held a meeting to discuss matters that should be promoted or abolished.</p>
<p>The picture they published was very welcomed by the refugees. It is said that the painter Zhang Meisun was responsible for the picture, and the writer Yao Sufeng explained it in simple words, such as describing Shanghai's position, Shanghai's hustle and bustle, the enemy's situation, killing and arson, inhumanity, and the necessity of our resistance, etc. The second lesson of the third issue of the pictorial was a picture of displaced people, with the words "People with homes become homeless, people with money become penniless, many people lost their lives, many people have no food to eat". These few words can deeply stimulate the displaced refugees who have no homes to return to and are heartbroken by the scenes, which is very effective.</p>
<p>Sacrifice the price to benefit the students. It is heard that Principal Chen Hong is actively preparing to open the school as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Puyi Society Holds Health Sports Meeting</h3>

People from all walks of life are welcome to visit. In addition, at 7:00 PM on the 28th, the Shanghai Southern Secondary School Students Mandarin Speech Contest will also be held at the Language Society, and there will be singing by the Qingxin Girls' School.</p>

<p>(Hangzhou Special Dispatch) The basketball championship initiated by the Zhejiang Provincial Stadium has reached its thirteenth day.

In the semi-finals on the 21st, Hongdao defeated Women's Vocational with a score of 22 to 7. Because the three teams of Hongdao, Municipal Middle School, and Women's Vocational each won twice in this group, and the scores were equal, another semi-final must be scheduled. At 2:00 PM on the 22nd, the Shanghai Faux French Institute team, which won the right to the finals in the men's group A, competed with the Zhejiang Institute of Technology team for the championship. As a result, the Shanghai Faux French Institute's basketball skills were superior to those of the Zhejiang Institute of Technology in all aspects.

The championship was won by the Shanghai Faux French Institute.</p>
<h3>The Football Field is Calm: First Friendship Match on Sunday in March</h3>
<p>Starlight Defeats the French Army Four to Zero</p>
<p>Hua Ling Ties With Qinghua Team One to One</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, the bustling football matches have disappeared. Counting the days, it has been more than three months. The China Football Field held two friendship matches for the first time the day before yesterday. Although the football skills were not superb, the fans had been quiet for a long time, so no fewer than five or six hundred people went to watch. The first match started at 3:00 PM. Starlight defeated the French Army four to one. The first half was two to one, and the second half was two to zero. The second match started at 4:30 PM. Hua Ling tied with Qinghua one to one. There were no goals in the second half. Famous players Li Yichen and Wang Changying joined Hua Ling to fight, Li as center forward and Wang as defender. However, the field was wet and slippery after the rain, and they had not trained for a long time, so their performance was inevitably diminished. The thrilling moments also won cheers. Jia Jiliang scored for Hua Ling, and Wang Guorong scored for Qinghua. The lineups for the three teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Hua Ling Lineup</p>

Yanjing University is the first in baseball, Tsinghua is second, and Furen is third. Yanjing University and Peking University are in a confrontational position in tennis. Tsinghua and Furen are also not bad. However, Yanjing University is most likely to win the championship, followed by Peking University, and then Tsinghua and Furen.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Market: Rapid and Sharp Rise of 13.1 Taels</h3>
<p>Surpassing 730 Taels: Yesterday, the 23rd, the gold price soared, surpassing 730 taels without significant fluctuations. Trading hovered around 5 taels both before and after noon, ultimately surging by 13 taels. The peak occurred early on, primarily due to repeated declines in the silver market and the formation of the Saito "super-party" cabinet in Japan. The general sentiment was that international crises were unlikely, strengthening confidence. Buyers were excited, and short sellers rushed to cover. Foreign exchange was also brisk but with slight fluctuations, causing gold prices to fluctuate by 2-3 taels at times. The afternoon market moved from decline to sharpness, with a prominent upward trend, eventually standing above 732 taels. Those who had not settled their June contracts found that the premium was only 2 taels, still offered by short sellers. The overall situation of the day is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Morning Session Immediately Reveals Peak</h3>
<p>The opening price for July contracts in the morning session rose sharply by 12 taels and 8 mace, reaching 732 taels. The previous day, major banks and American banks each fell by one-eighth, and private cables were also slightly down. The market appeared weak, but buyers were active, with Yuan Mao Yong, Hong Kang Yong, and Wupin, etc., all entering the market, reaching 33.5 taels. At that time, Da De Cheng, Wan Xing, Rui Xing, Shun Li, Tong Tai Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Ding Chang, etc., all sold, causing the price to plummet by 5 taels. Furthermore, with offers coming from Mumbai, August US dollars were priced at 30.8125 yuan, and September required 31 yuan to sell. English gold for August was priced at 1 shilling and 8 pence. Consequently, at 9:15 AM, the price was 728 taels and 7 mace. After 5-6 minutes, it rose by 3 taels, then quickly retreated by over 2 taels. This was due to varying payouts from different firms. At 9:30 AM, the shilling opening price narrowed by 0.125, and the US dollar by 0.375. Subsequently, Tong Tai Chang, Da Xing Yong, etc., entered the market, immediately raising the price by 3 taels. At 9:40 AM, it reached 732 taels and 3 mace. Afterwards, the US dollar seemed firmer, with September contracts trading at 31.125 yuan. There were also many sellers in the market, including Fu Chang, Da De Cheng, Yu He, and Wan Xing. Near 10:00 AM, it was 728 taels and 8 mace. Shortly after, Qian Chang Xiang, Hong Kang Yong, Ri Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, etc., bought in, reaching 730 taels and 8 mace. At 10:15 AM, it began to decline again as Yuan Mao Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Tai, Fu Tai Heng, and the Dalian gang, etc., sold extensively. The Japanese Commercial Bank also sold July US dollars at 30.6875 yuan, and Anda offered June at 30.5 yuan. Until after 11:20 AM, it was 728 taels and 1 mace. However, within an hour, the price fluctuated by just over 1 tael, then quickly returned by over 1 tael. Da De Cheng re-entered the market, and Heng Chang Yong, etc., also purchased, reaching 729.5 taels at 11:30 AM. The market then closed at 729.1 taels, with Wupin trading at a premium of 0.6 mace.

After 2:30 PM, Tong Tai Chang, the Dalian gang, Yuan Da Yong, etc., sold, and the US dollar appeared weak. Shanghai offered August at 30.8125 to 30.9375 yuan, and English gold for September could settle at 1 shilling, 8 pence, and 0.125. At 2:45 PM, it was 728 taels. Afterwards, it rebounded, driven by interbank trading of June English gold at 1 shilling, 7 pence, and 0.9375, and June US dollars at 30.4375 yuan, with August contracts trading at 30.8125 yuan. Additionally, Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Wan Xing, etc., bought in, propelling the price upwards by 5 taels, reaching 733 taels at 4:10 PM. During this time, fluctuations were no more than a few cash or at most a little over 1 tael. It then retreated slightly by 1 tael and 2 mace, to 731 taels and 8 mace. By the 4:30 PM closing bell, the price was 732 taels and 3 mace, an increase of 13 taels and 1 mace compared to last Saturday. Wupin traded at a premium of 0.7 mace. The maximum price for the day was 733.5 taels, and the minimum was 728 taels, a difference of 5.5 taels. The indicative price was estimated at 74-70 taels pressed down. Accounts showed 32 taels for June and 29 taels for July, with a supplementary water charge of 32 taels in the afternoon and 35 taels. The naked strip added 9.75 taels.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Market: Overt and Covert Trading Both Brisk</h3>
<p>Most Chinese Merchants Cling to Existing Short Positions</p>
<p>Arbitrage Prices Differ by Over 10 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, Monday, there was no telegraphic news for the silver market and foreign exchange. However, due to the reported decline yesterday, HSBC's listed prices were reduced by half a notch, with English gold down by 0.125 to 1 shilling, 7 pence, and 0.625, and US dollars down by 0.375 to 29.875 yuan.

<h3>Month-End Settlement Nears: Both Call Loan and Short-Term Loan Markets are Weak</h3>
<p>Very Little Business Development</p>
<p>Market Overview: Recently, the financial sector is focused on month-end settlements, so there is little willingness to develop business. It is necessary to get through this difficult hurdle before making major moves. Therefore, there is very little progress at present. Clients are urgently requesting account settlements or demanding the repayment of large debts. Consequently, the scope of business is contracting, and there is no possibility of expansion. The market atmosphere is bleak.</p>
<p>Call Loan Rates: Due to the lack of competition between buyers and sellers in the "foreign cash" call loan market in the morning session, the call loan rate finally weakened to 7 cash without any interest. There were few transactions in the afternoon session, and the price remained at 7 cash. The "silver cash" rate was 7 fen in the morning session and 5 fen in the afternoon session, resulting in a decrease of 0.05 compared to the previous day. Banks did not post rates, and the markup with water was only 0.02-0.03.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Early in the morning session, Jiangnan small silver dollars fell slightly by 0.0125 to 0.060875. The afternoon session recovered by 0.0025 to 0.0609, resulting in a slight decrease of 0.01 compared to the previous day's market price. Transactions were 4,000 jiao in the morning session and 7,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Guangdong small silver dollars were 0.0598125 in the morning session and 0.05975 in the afternoon session, resulting in a total decrease of 0.03 compared to the previous day's morning session. Transactions were 130,000 jiao in the morning session and 15,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper cash decreased by 1,000 strings to 420,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds": Banks received and released foreign merchant bills totaling 2,340,000, remittance and mortgage goods miscellaneous totaling 3,450,000, telegraphic transfer funds over 800,000, special funds over 1 million, and withdrawals of 600,000. Chinese banks received and released bills totaling 2,560,000, various commodity taxes, remittance mortgages, and miscellaneous totaling 5,560,000, special funds totaling over 1 million, and withdrawals of 800,000. Money shops and silver guilds received and released over 27,700,000, markup funds of 4,330,000, remittances from various routes of 500,000, and cash receipts of 7-800,000. "Foreign Funds": Remittances and bills made in the morning session totaled 640,000, and 385,000 in the afternoon session. Banknotes were 55,000 in the morning session and 20,000 in the afternoon session. Off-exchange banknotes were 105,000 in the morning session and 40,000 in the afternoon session. Checks were 70,000 in the morning session and 15,000 in the afternoon session. Bank buying and selling transactions totaled 950,000 in both sessions. Foreign exchanges received and released over 1,440,000, banknote inflow and outflow over 1,660,000, foreign currency borrowing and lending over 1,780,000, and money shop and foreign guild funds released over 6,550,000, foreign currency markup funds released over 2,220,000. Small money shops had transactions over 500,000.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bonds: Prices Slightly Down by a Few Corners</h3>
<p>Market Conditions Still Good, Turnover Over 3.7 Million. Yesterday, the market conditions for various bonds at the Chinese Securities Exchange were as follows: spot transactions totaled 39,500 yuan, of which demobilization bonds accounted for 15,000 yuan, and the rest only a few thousand yuan. The futures market was more active than the previous day. Although prices did not rise or fall significantly, the atmosphere for buyers and sellers was not dull. Transactions were 1.8-1.9 million in each of the morning and afternoon sessions, totaling 3,755,000 yuan. Unified tax bonds accounted for the most, at 940,000, followed by salt tax, 20 customs tax, and 19 customs charity bonds, each at 4-500,000. Demobilization 20 bonds also had over 300,000, and the rest were still clear. As for the trend of various bonds, although market transactions were more active than the previous day, there were still few large transactions from major players. Transactions were quite dispersed among various parties, and the supply and demand situation remained balanced. Therefore, various prices continued to fluctuate without significant increases or decreases. There was only a change of 0.40 for the whole day. The two morning sessions were more stable, with almost no change from the end of last week. The buying interest in the afternoon session was slightly weaker, so prices fell back slightly. As a result, only the six-percent fixed-term futures, demobilization, demobilization-aid 19 Customs, and other spot goods rose slightly compared to the previous day, while the rest fell back by 0.2-0.4. The market situation for compensation bonds was still as dull as before.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Report from the American Eastern Silver Company</p>
<p>Saturday Market: Although the opening price was slightly higher than the previous day, buying and selling were not enthusiastic. Therefore, the quoted prices fluctuated throughout the day. As a result, the closing prices of railway and industrial stocks all fell by several points. Public utility stocks only rose by 0.03 pounds. The market was filled with a quiet atmosphere, and transactions only reached 300,000 shares. Most traders were generally uninterested in the half-day market on Saturday due to the dull news this week, simply passing the time and waiting for future developments. However, this attitude cannot be maintained for long. It is expected that the atmosphere will change in the near future. The news announced recently that the Federal Reserve Bank is prepared to provide loans to assist the industrial sector did not seem to have the desired effect in the Saturday market, as traders were still skeptical about the method of lending. However, the previous news is still one of the most promising things to encourage people. The Dow Jones daily index is attached as follows:</p>
<p>May 20 May 21</p>
<p>30 Industrials 53.31 53.04 Down 0.27</p>
<p>20 Railroads 17.67 17.40 Down 0.27</p>
<p>20 Utilities 21.73 21.76 Up 0.03</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market is Stagnant, Month-End Closing in Mid-May... Both Sides Watch</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is extremely sluggish and very quiet. With the month-end closing in mid-May approaching, credit is becoming tighter, and all parties are lacking vitality, causing morale to be very depressed. However, the factories' attitude is still calm, so the current yarn market price is still holding steady. However, the situation is extremely sluggish, so although the environment is worsening, new households are not eager to sell. Most people are taking a wait-and-see attitude, so the situation has become a deadlock. It is necessary to wait for post-holiday activity in customer sales, but judging from the overall trend, I am afraid that hope is limited.</p>
<h3>Very Few Human Mark Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>The human mark lottery market opened with rising gold prices, resulting in a slight shortage of sellers in the market. The prices for each month rose by 0.4-0.5, but trading was extremely light, so the market closed very early due to too few lottery tickets. In the afternoon, the prices for each month rose by 0.1-0.2. The total turnover for the day was 3,200 bales. It was found that Tong Fu sold 200 bales, Zhen Da 100 bales, Sen Kang 350 bales, Chang Feng 350 bales, and Yong Da 100 bales. Geng Feng bought 150 bales, Rui Da 200 bales, Shen Ji 400 bales, Ji Feng 200 bales, Xin Cheng 100 bales, and Xie Sheng 100 bales. The closing prices for the human mark lottery are listed below:</p>
<p>Human Mark Closing Price Up/Down Inventory</p>
<p>September 1539 Up 0.7 22,850</p>
<p>July 1535 Up 0.6 15,050</p>
<p>October 1539 0.5 25,550</p>
<p>August 1536 0.6 20,850</p>
<p>Total 84,300</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Sales Clear, Price Set</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still sluggish. It was found that all parties bought a total of 310 bales throughout the day, with 20 bales from domestic suppliers, 10 bales from Xiamen, 152 bales from Guangdong, 95 bales from the interior, 37 bales from Ningbo, 40 bales from Youtou, 2 bales from Jiangxi, and 5 bales from Anqing. The market is stable.</p>
<h3>No Major Fluctuations in Cotton Market, Imported Cotton Also Hovering</h3>
<p>The cotton market is still in a calm state, and there will probably be no major changes for the time being. This is because there is a lack of buying and selling in the market, and the current situation is still bleak. As for imported cotton, it is also hovering in a stagnant state, so the fluctuations are very small, with only a rise or fall of 5-10 pounds. The consumption of Shanghai factories is very low, and the price of imported cotton is still low, so it is difficult for factories to have an appetite for it for the time being.</p>
<p>Zheng Mark Slightly Up: The Zheng mark lottery market opened with a slight increase in prices due to the rise in gold prices, even though American cotton had fallen. Prices for each month rose by 0.5, but the Ningbo gang sold 1,200 dan. In the afternoon, prices rose again by 0.5. The total turnover for the day was 4,300 dan. It was found that Tong Fu sold 300 dan, Heng Yi 300 dan, Tian Long 400 dan, Yu Chang 1,200 dan, and Rui Yuan 200 dan. Xin Cheng bought 300 dan, Chang He 400 dan, Gu Da 200 dan, Xin Heng 300 dan, and Yi Yuan 400 dan. The closing prices for the Zheng mark lottery are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Mark Closing Price Up/Down Inventory</p>
<p>October 3265 Up 10 62,900</p>
<p>July 3250 Up 15 42,600</p>
<p>Total 165,300</p>
<p>August 3265 15 57,800</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Unchanged: Spot cotton transactions are deadlocked, and all factories have unanimously suspended operations.</p>
<h3>American Cotton: American Anxing Report: Demand is Limited, Supply is Also Scarce</h3>
<p>The Base Price Shows a Stable State</p>
<p>The American Anxing Cotton Company of this port received a telegram from New York on May 19, stating that the cotton market has no special characteristics and is mostly tied to the state of domestic and foreign finance and politics. Demand is not much, and sales are also few. The base price is stable, and sales of cloth are sluggish. Although cotton mills have greatly reduced production, it is ultimately ineffective. The new cotton crop is progressing well, and the weather is good.</p>
<h3>Last Week's American Cotton</h3>
<p>In Irregular Fluctuations</p>
<p>But the New Cotton Crop is Progressing Well</p>
<p>New York, May 20, telegram reporting on the cotton market situation for the week: This week's raw cotton market situation fluctuated. Industry purchases and short-covering at price drops were enough to create a stable sentiment. The lack of rapid progress in Congress to balance the US budget and the unsatisfactory actions in the securities market caused some people to sell in disappointment. However, there was no selling pressure in the South, and the prices were already very low. Therefore, when the market price continued to fall, a buying trend emerged. There was no active action from both buyers and sellers, which shows that people in the market want to wait for the actions of Washington officials and the development of cotton crops and business conditions. In the past week, cotton crops have developed more slowly due to low humidity and overcast skies in the southwest and dry soil in the southeast. However, the slow progress of cotton crops did not affect the market sentiment. As for the increase or decrease in cotton fields, the general opinion has not changed. Most people in the cotton industry believe that the cotton crop has started well. Japan's demand in the South has already decreased, and there are not many sales in the interior. The base price is still stable.</p>
<h3>Mumbai Cotton Industry Weekly News</h3>
<p>Last week's futures business was almost completely suspended due to local riots. There were inquiries from Europe and the Far East about Pingguoer, but very few transactions. In addition, there is another reason for the downturn, which is that the cotton fields will be expanded even further. In terms of spot goods, due to the poor demand for yarn and cloth, the local factories have sufficient cotton in stock, so naturally there is no improvement. The statistics for last week are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1931 1932 Cumulative total since September 1st</p>
<p>Receipts 2,960 1,688</p>
<p>Weekend inventory 967 829</p>
<p>Cumulative total exports since September 1st 1,929 726</p>
<p>To Europe 509 106</p>
<p>To China 291 176</p>
<p>To Japan 1,109 411</p>
<p>Other places 20 33</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Fresh Silkworm Cocoon Price in Xinchang is Low, Self-drying</h3>
<p>The Highest Price for Foreign Varieties is Only 30 Yuan</p>
<p>The amount of spring silkworms raised in various cities and villages in Xinchang has been greatly reduced. In addition, the weather has been bad, with alternating cold and heat, and excessive rainfall. Silkworm diseases are rampant, and many are discarded. The cocoon production has been reduced and only accounts for less than 30% of the usual harvest. Only two or three cocoon brokers in the entire county have opened scales, and they all restrict the cocoon price, specializing in improved varieties of cocoons. The highest price is only 30 yuan, and the local varieties are only 24-25 yuan. However, farmers need about 50 yuan for silkworm capital, so the losses are too great. Most of them are carrying them back to dry them using local methods, and the cocoon market is almost lifeless.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silk Telegrams Not Relayed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port was still quiet. The raw silk telegrams sent to overseas European and American firms last week were not relayed to Shanghai yesterday morning. Both Chinese and foreign silk merchants were watching and not moving forward, and the market was quiet with no transactions.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Zhenmei Has Opened, 15 Taels Lower Than Last Year</h3>
<p>Several hundred boxes of Tunxi Zhenmei green tea were transported from Hangzhou yesterday. Tianyu Foreign Company opened at 155 taels, 15 taels lower than last year. There were also scattered transactions of Zhenmei green tea from other routes such as Suian Tuzhuang. The market plate has not changed from before. Only over 730 boxes of Qimen black tea were traded in the entire city. Dealers' recognized prices were tighter than before, but Chinese merchants maintained a firm attitude due to high costs. There was no drastic loosening in the market.</p>
<h3>London Qicha Stock is Thin</h3>
<p>London telegram said that there are only over 1,300 boxes of Chinese Qimen black tea left, and the stock is extremely thin. However, the stock of Indian Ceylon tea is still abundant.</p>
<h3>Food: The Rice Market's Sales are Increasing Daily</h3>
<p>Changbang Dinggeng Arrives Sparsely and is the Firmest</p>
<p>South Shanghai: There were still quite a few people coming to the market yesterday morning. Changxi Dinggeng is still scarce, and the thin rice here has seen higher prices. Ordinary prices have risen by 1 foot due to brisk sales. Su Tong Pingli and other short-grain rice are in high demand from both rural areas and customers, and the market is tight by 0.2 yuan. The early and late rice market is active, and the market is stable. There is a slight shortage of Yanglu tops, and the price has not changed. Yin Yuan liquor workshops still have good demand, with fluctuations of 0.1-0.2 at the opening.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: The weather was sunny yesterday, and the sources from various gangs were 20-30, and sales turned better. Dinggeng from Changbang arrived sparsely, and prices suddenly increased by 0.1 yuan. The quoted price for crude short-grain rice from the West Road is firm and stable. The locals are optimistic due to the approaching Wu Festival. There is a slight arrival of early and late rice. The quantity of Yanglu top-quality goods is limited and has not changed. The total amount of Heyu rice throughout the day was about 4,000 shi.</p>
<h3>Huaian Merchants Purchasing Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Price Increases by Five Percent</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was very active, with merchants from various inland areas inquiring, in addition to those from this street. Furthermore, new merchants from Huaian were purchasing in the market, causing prices to rise by about five percent. However, there was little activity in high-quality goods, and the asking prices in the market were actually lower than the previous day. Moreover, with Dumi rice rising by half a yuan for several consecutive days, people were particularly optimistic. The market opened with 5,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice, priced at ten yuan and six jiao to ten yuan, four jiao, and two fen; 400 bags of Xiaojiao old coarse rice, priced at nine yuan and three jiao, and a half; 500 bags of Saigon No. 1, priced at eleven yuan and six jiao to eleven yuan and a half; and 1,500 bags of Mindang rice, priced at eleven yuan, with the price for rice from other routes at eleven yuan and one jiao. Although there were no foreign firms selling Xiaojiao rice, many merchants who had purchased and stored it were willing to sell it back, and the market immediately showed signs of fatigue. The opening price for May delivery was four liang, nine qian, two fen, and a half. Yinghua Co. offered four liang, nine qian, and four fen. Merchants from this street also bought back 105 bags of Jiangxi machine yuan, priced at fourteen yuan and five jiao and a half.</p>
<h3>The Starch Market is Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the starch market was generally quiet, as sales in various areas were stagnant. Transactions in the market were exceptionally quiet. The opening prices for "warship" starch were initially stable, but due to a lack of activity from merchant groups, the prices were reduced by five li, opening at two liang, zero fen, three li, and a half. Honglan Car starch prices increased because all the warehouse receipts were held by merchants in this street, opening at two liang, zero fen, four li, and two li, and a half. There were very few transactions, mostly just ceremonial. Observing the future trend, with the new wheat crop about to enter the market, all parties are in a state of watchful waiting, and the future trend is feared to be one of fluctuation.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Sugar Over-Supplied</h3>
<p>Market Steps Up Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's public association had a rather active trading session. Moreover, demand exceeded supply, and prices rose accordingly. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white sugar traded at thirteen liang, five qian, and a half; Hong Kong goods at thirteen liang, four qian, and a half; and high-quality goods were bid at thirteen liang, seven qian, but still lacking supply, and the market situation was extremely buoyant. No. 20 medium sand white sugar traded at thirteen liang and two qian, with an upward trend. Taikoo CW mark traded at fifteen liang and nine qian, HM mark at fourteen liang, H mark at twelve liang and two qian, CX mark at fifteen liang and six qian, and Tianjin B mark at sixteen liang and four qian, later at sixteen liang and four qian and a half. The market was only stable. Changxing Co. offered 2,000 bags of coarse sand white sugar recently shipped from Hong Kong, priced at thirteen liang, four qian, and a half per yuan, and all were sold, creating a buoyant market atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Demand for Cotton Prints and Pongee Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>No Major Changes in Local Cotton Cloth; Sales to Local Merchants Are Still Fairly Good, Especially to Northern Merchants. Yesterday, Transactions Continued with Merchants from Niuzhuang, Yantai, Tianjin, etc. Shuanglong sold for seven liang and six qian, Shuangyu Jiqing for seven liang, five qian, and a half, and Samsung for seven liang and seven qian, all of which were purchased. Sales to merchants in the Yangtze River area remained sluggish, and thirteen-pound cloth remained difficult to sell. Feitai Ren Dingqiu all sold for five liang, three qian, seven fen, and a half, Magou for five liang and seven qian, and nine-pound cloth was in highest demand from merchants in this street and Ningbo.

<p>Western Goods Become Suddenly Active Due to Hot Weather; Demand from This Street is Highest, Especially for Cotton Prints and Pongee, Which Are Selling Even More Smoothly, and Prices Have Also Risen Slightly. Yesterday, Yuanfang Bai Xu traded for three qian, one fen, and a half; Xinxie for three qian and one fen; Huaji for three qian; and Hengli for two qian and nine fen and a half. The above are all made of full yarn. One yarn and one thread, Gongping Baizi Gaosheng, traded for three qian and nine fen. Xinxie Sanyi Tuhua Jin traded for four qian and two fen and a half, and white Chong hemp gauze, Deki goods, traded for two qian and five li. Zhonghe double width traded for three qian and eight fen and a half.</p>
<p>Observations on the Broadcloth and Wool Market Before Settlement</p>
<p>Recently, the broadcloth and wool market has been declining rapidly, with prices falling steadily. The weakness of the trend is beyond expectations. Yesterday, Jihuater broadcloth was purchased by merchants from Da Xiaochuan. Falong, Balene, Yusane, Huang Xie Wen, Bai Ji, Bai Zhigong, and inland small merchant groups have slight spot needs. Sellers require cash payment for all goods offered, whether retail or wholesale.</p>
<h3>Copper Coin Bureau Purchases Over Two Hundred Dan of Copper</h3>
<p>Other Hardware Sales Are Actually Sluggish</p>
<p>Hardware transactions are sluggish because the settlement period is approaching, and no merchant groups have large appetites. Also, factory transactions have been very sluggish recently, so the market feels quite desolate. Except for the Yangtze River merchants buying over a hundred dan of French and Western nails and English steel sheets yesterday, few other merchants touched them. The price of French Western nails opened at eight liang, and the price of English steel sheets remained unchanged. The price of green lead fell by another qian yesterday, selling for thirteen liang and five qian. Only a hundred dan or so were traded. Transactions of plain white iron, corrugated iron, new lead wire, etc., are also few and far between. Fortunately, the standard prospect has not changed. The opening price of copper was down two qian and a half yesterday, selling for thirty-seven liang and seven qian and a half. It is said that the Copper Coin Bureau opened over two hundred dan yesterday. Aside from inquiries from merchant groups and factories, no one touched it. In addition, the market for triangular iron, new foreign silver, black iron sheet, white lead sheet, etc., remains relatively unchanged.</p>

<p>The Sayings of Ma Xiangbo, the Ninety-Three-Year-Old</p>
<h3>Cai Yuanpei Reads Latin</h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>When I was young, it was very difficult to read foreign books. There were no dictionaries or grammar books. I translated the French grammar book, and I compiled the lecture notes for Latin for Aurora University.</p>
<p>At that time, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Jusheng, and Wang Kangnian all insisted on studying Latin. I advised them to study English and French, which were more practical. They refused, saying that Latin was the source of Western writing and must be studied. So I had to agree. Later, I taught them Cicero's works. The enthusiasm of young people like Cai, Zhang, and Wang for learning was truly admirable! I still remember Cai Yuanpei teaching at Nanyang Public School in Xujiahui. I lived in a building in front of Tushanwan. Every morning, Yuanpei would walk from Nanyang Public School, about four or five li, to study Latin with me. Sometimes, at five o'clock, when it was still dark, Yuanpei would shout softly outside: "Xiangbo! Xiangbo!" I was very surprised that someone was coming to see me so early in the morning. I opened the window and looked down, and it was Cai Yuanpei. I quickly waved my hand and said to him: "It's too early, it's too early. Come back at eight or nine o'clock!" Cai Yuanpei, that good child, had to leave disappointed.</p>
<h3>Summer Parrots at Shichahai</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>| Miscellaneous Writings on the Old Capital - 5 |</p>
<p>The intense sunlight shines directly onto the ground without any obstruction. The willows droop their heads, breathing subtly. People are steamed with a little sweat by this scorching atmosphere, lazily afraid to move. From the top of some tree comes a burst of cicada sounds, as if to say that high summer has arrived.</p>
<p>After lunch, it is almost the hottest time, especially in this desert-like old city. All the moisture in the soil is being evaporated. If you don't find a cool place to spend this long day, then you may be annoyed by the weather.</p>
<p>Around one o'clock, E and I couldn't stand sitting in the study. We didn't have the usual interest in turning over posts and reading inscriptions. Finally, braving the scorching sun, we strolled across the lonely long street until we reached Shichahai. There was only bright sunlight lying on the road, and not even the sound of a camel bell could be heard.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Shichahai, it had already been arranged like a summer resort. Many thatched huts were built continuously along the wide, lotus-filled water. However, all sides were open, so that one could avoid the sun and feel the gentle breeze. This was indeed a suitable place to spend this long day. E and I made a pot of tea and chose a quieter place to sit down. After sitting for a while, we felt a little cooler, so we wanted to move around again. The edge of Shichahai was lined with connected cool sheds and stall canopies, forming a long street. The long street was full of tourists. The so-called Northern-style women with bound feet, wearing brightly colored clothes, were like butterflies, showing off their flower-like姿态 in the crowd, and their lively eyes would occasionally glance at you from under their sparse hair. Or they would decorate this barren Shichahai into a charming palace with a gilded small fan, as if this high summer had returned to the spring day of flowers and birds. When I was stranded on the journey in the sweltering summer every year, I couldn't help but think of this fascinating Shichahai.</p>
<h3>World Short News</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>Heat-Conducting Wallpaper: England has recently invented a heat-conducting wallpaper. When pasted on the walls, it can generate mild heat in the room. It has been successfully tested several times. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company's regular mail steamer, "Duchess of Richmond," has this wallpaper pasted on the ceilings of several cabins. Even in extremely cold weather, the room feels like spring. The origin of this invention comes from a special type of clothing worn by aviators. When flying in cold weather or to extremely high altitudes, they have to wear this heat-conducting clothing. The method is to weave thin radio copper wires into the fabric like a net. When an electric current is passed through, it can conduct heat without feeling cold. The invention of heat-conducting wallpaper is essentially the same. The paper material used is isolated and non-combustible. Thin electric wires are passed behind the paper, but they are not visible on the surface, looking like ordinary wallpaper. When the current is turned on, the walls will generate mild warmth.</p>
<h3>Humorous Instruction</h3>
<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>In modern wedding ceremonies, it is necessary to invite a venerable and virtuous marriage officiant. This is an indispensable character.</p>
<p>Yingchuan student Tong Hongnong and Ms. Hongnong were married during the national crisis. As usual, they invited a famous person to officiate the wedding. After reading the marriage certificate, the officiant, as usual, delivered a few words of instruction. In addition to two auspicious platitudes, he added three very witty humorous instructions to the bride, which were:</p>
<p>"At critical moments, you must bear the pain and not resist."</p>
<p>At the time, the bride seemed to want to laugh but couldn't after hearing these words. I don't know if she was shy or annoyed.</p>
<h3>Two Nineteens in the North and South</h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>The soldiers defending our country in the Battle of Shanghai are the Nineteenth Route Army. With an army of 30,000, they faced an enemy four times their size. With flesh and blood, they faced sharp weapons. They fought fiercely for a month, repeatedly defeating the enemy. The loyalty, courage, and heroism of the Nineteenth Army are praised not only by our countrymen but also respected by people all over the world. Now, the humiliating armistice agreement has been signed. Damn the Japanese! They considered Shanghai unworthy of attention and abandoned the south for the north, concentrating their efforts to seize our eastern provinces. Looking north to the sky, the situation at Shanhaiguan is extremely urgent. The defending general there is He Zhuguo. The troops under He's command are the Nineteenth Brigade. The people of the South have already seen how the Southern Nineteen, with their spirit of sacrifice, inflicted great wounds on the enemy, won national glory, and enhanced international standing. It is a pity that they were hindered by treacherous officials and could not achieve complete success. Therefore, we can only hope that the Northern Nineteen will continue the fight to kill the enemy. According to reports, the Japanese troops demanded the right to freely suppress bandits in the area within eighty li of Yuguan. Brigade Commander He told them, "The bandits within Chinese territory will be suppressed by the Chinese army. We do not need others to do it for us. I, the brigade commander, am different from others. If anyone endangers the people within my jurisdiction, I will fight them with all my strength. I am not afraid of being crushed to pieces." A few words, full of righteousness and awe. We firmly believe that the Northern Nineteen can also resist Japan without a doubt. One soldier guarding the pass will not allow the barbarian cavalry to invade. A single pillar supporting the great mansion, worthy of being a cornerstone of the country. Moreover, we will drive the enemy out of the border, paving the way for the recovery of lost territory, and unite the righteous army to drive the invaders from the three islands. We will see loyalty, courage, and heroism, and the Southern Nineteen will not be able to claim all the credit. However, the atmosphere in the Northeast is filled with non-resistance, and the Northern Nineteen is only a single brigade. With the weakness of a single brigade, trapped in a harsh environment, their hardships are much greater than those of the Southern Nineteen. We hope that General He can uphold the spirit of being crushed to pieces and vow to shed the last drop of blood at Shanhaiguan. Then, hardships will not be a concern, and the enemy will not be difficult to defeat. Therefore, this same Nineteenth, whether the Southern one is strong or the Northern one is strong, we dare not say for sure.</p>
<h3>A Visit with Mrs. Gandhi (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>She is an Unknown Woman</p>
<p>India has been conquered by England for a long time, but Gandhi's non-violent resistance has made him admired by the people of the world. We already know about Gandhi's knowledge and personality, but we probably don't know everything about Mrs. Gandhi. Because she is an unknown woman, "The Woman that nobody knows." This time, she was imprisoned for forty-five days. After being released, H.J. Greenwall, a news reporter for the Daily News, visited Mrs. Gandhi. Now, in order to help readers understand this unknown woman, I will translate the interview with Mrs. Gandhi that Greenwall published after the visit:</p>
<p>I have visited this unknown woman, and she is Mrs. Gandhi. She has just been released from prison after serving her first 45-day sentence.</p>
<p>It was indeed a difficult task. We waited for three consecutive days for the visit because she happened to be participating in a conference. Later, she finally walked into the room where we were waiting. The room had a flat roof. From the opening, we could see the foothills of Malabar Hill. The Indian temple was just opposite the room.</p>
<p>"How did you feel in prison?" This was the first question I asked her. Mrs. Gandhi is a very short woman. Her height is probably less than four feet. After smoothing out her black-edged clothes, she replied:</p>
<p>"Not very good; indeed," she said with a smile, "because I am Gandhi's wife, they treat me differently. Among the prisoners, I am the"</p>
<p>"Considered the most favored."</p>
<p>Our seats were very close to the stars, and the sky was quickly darkening. Mrs. Gandhi didn't say much, and none of it was in English, so our conversation was entirely translated.</p>
<p>The number of people in the room quickly increased. The first to appear was a young woman wearing glasses. She interrupted our conversation with her experiences of six months in prison. Later, a young girl came to tell Mrs. Gandhi how she and four companions were being interfered with by the police's freedom. Finally, a young man wearing glasses entered my left ear. He loudly exclaimed how brutal the people on the northwest border were behaving.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gandhi was barefoot, wearing a pair of glass bangles on each of her thin arms.</p>
<p>I know that she is 55 years old, but judging from her sparse gray hair, by European standards, she is at least over 60 years old.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gandhi now has many young prison companions, who are all guilty of underpaying the salt tax. According to Mrs. Gandhi, these young women were thrown on the ground by the police, their clothes were torn, and they were abused very painfully.</p>
<h3>Finger Sacrifice for Burial</h3>
<p>— Rui Yucheng</p>
<p>A resident of our county, Mr. Chen, graduated from Nanjing Higher Normal School. He has served as a Chinese language teacher in various secondary schools. He is currently the director of the county's Public Education Center. He is a man of deep emotions, especially devoted to his spouse. Several years ago, he married Ms. Mao from the same hometown. The family was very harmonious. Two years later, Ms. Mao became pregnant. Mr. Chen was secretly delighted because this was the crystallization of their love. Unexpectedly, after a few months, Ms. Mao suddenly had a miscarriage and, feeling heartbroken, fell ill. Mr. Chen took care of her day and night, without any fatigue. On one hand, he hired famous doctors to diagnose and treat her. He personally decocted the medicine, not relying on servants, for fear of making mistakes. Who knew that Ms. Mao's illness would gradually become more severe, leaving the doctors helpless. Mr. Chen felt distressed, but on the surface, he remained calm and served her. After seven days, Ms. Mao passed away. At the time of her death, she held Mr. Chen's left hand tightly. She could no longer speak, but her hand remained tightly clasped until her last breath. The family wanted to pry it open, but Mr. Chen insisted not to. He told people to bring a sharp knife and cut off the four fingers of his left hand, so that his beloved deceased wife could hold them. She held them all the way to the coffin and into the earth.</p>
<p>This story has spread almost throughout the hometown. Mr. Chen is still alive today. People call him "Mr. One Finger."</p>
<h3>Records of Military Horses in the Double Pavilion (61)</h3>
<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Boundless Sorrow and Repentance, Difficult to Achieve Open-Mindedness; Extreme Singing and Dancing, to Witness Authority</p>
<p>After hearing these gentle and sad words, Liang Xiaoyun glanced at An Yutian unintentionally. Seeing him bowing his head to his chest, his heart seemed to be filled with infinite sorrow and shame. She couldn't help but sigh deeply and said, "In that case, I am not as open-minded as others. But I have my own difficulties and had no choice but to do this. Now that things have reached this point, I can only betray others. When I have the opportunity in the future, I will explain my feelings to him." After saying this, she took out the check, folded it into a small square, and clipped it between her slender fingers. Then, she lightly tore it apart into two pieces, then four pieces from the two, and then eight pieces from the four, until there were countless pieces. With a wave of her hand, these many pieces of paper flew like butterflies, fluttering and falling onto the soft carpet in the room without making a sound. As a result, the three people in the room all felt an inexplicable sadness, which attacked their hearts coldly. They looked at each other and froze in that humorous realm. Wei Zhuomou couldn't bear the silence and quietly wanted to escape. An Yutian made small talk and wanted to get up to see him off, but Wei Zhuomou turned his head and made a funny face at him. He also raised his right hand and touched his thumb and index finger together, making a slight strange sound. He slumped back down and let him go on his own. After another moment of silence, Liang Xiaoyun slowly wiped the moist marks around her eyes with her small handkerchief and gave An Yutian an extremely unnatural bitter smile. "Let's not think about this guilty thing anymore. Let me tell you a little about how I handled your first business today. Nowadays, the best way to maneuver in the official arena is to go through the inner line. Although Fifth Madam Ye and I are quite close, and that path can be considered the right one to take, it is still not enough to rely on selling empty favors. So-called worldly ways and human sentiments still require a considerable gift to be used as a stepping stone. I was fortunate to remember when I lived with her in the same troupe, I had a customer who gave me a very large chicken-heart-shaped jadeite ring. The color was dripping green, with no flaws at all. Although the price was not high, only a few thousand yuan, it would be very difficult to find the same one again. When she saw it at the time, she was very fond of it and praised it highly. At that time, I couldn't give it to her for no reason. It just happened to be saved for today and came in handy as a gift. It is difficult to give her other things that would suit her. It is also inconvenient to show too many traces. So, I just sent this one up, and it was very suitable."</p>

<h3>Free City</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The sound of a free city has been spreading for a long time, but I believe that there is no possibility of it being realized when viewed through common sense or human reason.</p>
<p>However, yesterday I heard a very peculiar conversation from a certain important person in a certain organization. He said,</p>
<p>During this Shanghai incident, our people suffered heavy losses, and we must find a way to help them. We are now planning to build two main roads in Shanghai, one from the southernmost point to the northernmost point, and one from the easternmost point to the westernmost point. We are also planning to build a residential area in a certain location to make it easier for people to solve the problem of housing. The estimated construction cost is about 10 million yuan. If that is not enough, we will add another 5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Readers, please close your eyes and think about this. What a grand and ambitious plan!</p>
<p>Ordinary residents will naturally welcome it when they hear that there are cheap houses available. Landlords and land brokers will see an opportunity to make money and will naturally not object. Even residents living closer to the concessions will consider this a one-time solution because they have suffered losses from moving their establishments due to repeated wartime events.</p>

<h3>The Anti-Japanese War</h3>
<p>— Cherry Blossom Hermitage</p>
<p>The country is in difficulty, and foreign insults invade. Jiangwan and Zhabei are filled with gunfire. Who says the soldiers are not capable of fighting? Last night, they were united in hatred against the enemy.</p>
<p>Ten thousand zhang of trenches crisscross, forming countless small rivers. The blood of the three armies is all generous. We will not rest until Lou Lan is beheaded.</p>
<p>Vowing not to return alive and sacrificing for the country, their battle achievements break through five thousand years. From now on, we will wash away the title of "sick man" and rein in our horses on the eastern coast of the Yellow Sea.</p>
<p>Thirty days of bitter fighting, with blood forming rivers, and hand-to-hand combat, the enemy is no match. Leaving behind a new war history, the red dust is ten li of ruins.</p>

<h3>Chemical Arts and Small Industry</h3>
<p>— Nai Zheng</p>
<p>We see glass with engraved text and picture designs that are very beautiful. These are mostly Japanese goods. They don't use knives to engrave them because glass is very hard and difficult to cut. They use chemical methods to engrave, the procedure is simple, and the cost of the chemicals used is very cheap. It's a pity that our country doesn't have this kind of small industry yet, mainly because not many people know about it. So, I'm introducing it now to promote it.</p>
<p>(1) Simple Engraving Method</p>
<p>First, coat the glass pane with beeswax. Use a small knife or needle to carve away the wax, writing words or drawing pictures. Then, take a large-mouthed lead bottle (made of light lead; other types of containers are unusable, or they will melt and crack). Inside, put fifteen parts calcium fluoride and nineteen parts sulfuric acid. Place it on a tripod iron stand and heat it with an alcohol lamp. Then, you can take the carved glass pane and place it over the mouth of the lead bottle to be fumed. At the same time, cover the back of the glass pane with a cold, wet cloth to prevent the wax from melting. After seven or eight minutes, silver-white will appear on the glass lines where there is no wax. Then, take it down, scrape off the wax with a knife, and wash it in hot water. The text or picture design will appear. The depth of the engraving is directly proportional to the fuming time.</p>
<p>(2) Fine Engraving Method</p>
<p>Take calcium fluoride and sulfuric acid (same amounts as in the previous method) and put them in a light lead retort. Seal the mouth of the bottle with a rubber stopper with a hole. Then, take an empty lead bottle and also seal the mouth tightly with a rubber stopper with a hole. Then, insert the two ends of a rubber tube into the two rubber stopper holes to connect the two bottles. Then, place the empty lead bottle in an ice bucket (add salt to the ice). Then, place the retort on an alcohol lamp and heat it. The two substances inside will melt and turn into gas, which will pass through the rubber tube to the empty bottle, where it will condense into liquid. Wait until all the gas has turned into liquid, then seal it with a non-porous rubber stopper and place it in a cool, damp place. Then, take a glass pane and coat it with wax and carve a design as in the previous method. Dip a rubber brush (shaped like a pencil) into this liquid and apply it to the glass where the wax has been removed. After half an hour, wash it off with warm water. The pattern made with this method is clearer and finer than the previous method, but the procedure is a little more cumbersome.</p>
<p>Also, the stripes and grids on the outside of measuring cups are made using the above method. If you want to make frosted glass (used in cameras), you can coat one side of the glass pane with beeswax, immerse it in the prepared liquid, quickly take it out with bamboo chopsticks (never use your hands), and rinse it in clean water.</p>
<p>Regarding the method of engraving calligraphy and paintings on glass, an article was published last month, but it was slightly different from the method in this article and did not include a fine engraving method, so I am re-recording it.</p>

<h3>Embarrassed</h3>
<p>— Li Chu</p>
<p>One afternoon of a week, I went into the ×× bookstore to select and buy a few practical books. It happened to be this Sunday, and there were particularly many customers, especially in this bookstore which had several modern female clerks. These customers, flowing in an endless stream, seemed to be visiting because of the presence of the female clerks. People in business are truly good at adapting to the psychology of customers. In this era of open social interaction, the boundaries between men and women have long been broken. Why not take this opportunity? On the one hand, it can expand business, and on the other hand, it can help women's productivity. It is a win-win situation and worth doing.</p>
<p>I stepped into the store and saw that there were also people who genuinely wanted to buy books, and there were also those who were looking around without buying. The male and female clerks didn't seem particularly busy either. Beside one of the counters stood a female customer, around twenty years old. Inside the counter were two female clerks, not much different in age from her. The female customer had been looking for a long time before she finally found a romance novel she wanted to read, and then asked one of the female clerks in a gentle tone, "What's this book like for romance matters?" The tall and slender female clerk smiled but didn't answer, while the other, plump female clerk抢着said, "Very good! Very good! You can buy one for reference!" Little did she know that it would infuriate the female clerk who had smiled and didn't answer earlier, who shouted loudly, "Ah! You've read it, you know, you're someone with experience in love!" As soon as she said this, the general public in the store turned to look at them and laugh. There were also a few who hadn't heard clearly who were saying in low voices, "What's going on? Could they be love rivals jealous of each other?" Seeing that everyone's expressions were paying attention to them, they felt very ashamed. Their goose-egg-colored faces, tinged with peach red, suddenly flushed red to their ears, revealing a very embarrassed look.</p>

<h3>Trilogy</h3>

<p>Deep within the peach blossoms by the embankment, the morning sun of spring tightly embraces this pair. She and he whisper:</p>
<p>"Bin Mei! Ah! You! When I first met"</p>
<p>you, I was determined to dedicate everything in my life completely to you!"</p>
<p>"Ah! Yes. I respectfully accept your kindness. I wish that in this world, only I can sympathize with you! Let only me...love you!"</p>
<p>"Ah! This intoxicates me, intoxicates me. I simply can't wait any longer for the wedding that hasn't yet arrived...What about you?"</p>

<p>In the dimness of the bedside lamp, the autumn night rain pathetically dripped on the wife's heart. Wife and husband whisper: "Dear, why are you coming back so late?"</p>
<p>"Naturally, there is something to do!"</p>
<p>"Won't you think that I am waiting for you?"</p>
<p>"But you should also know that I have my own business to attend to."</p>
<p>"Ah! Pity my illness..."</p>
<p>"Only your illness has this much..."</p>

<p>Amidst the dense snowflakes by the eaves, the winter north wind roars and shakes this young couple. She and he whisper:</p>
<p>"This child is really troublesome, always crying."</p>
<p>"Be patient, for the sake of our love! My husband."</p>
<p>"Love? It's long dead! Hmph!"</p>
<p>"...Then...my suffering..."</p>
<p>"Damn it! What's all the noise? You ugly woman!"</p>
<p>"Then let's just get a divorce. I think it will definitely be more comfortable than it is now."</p>
<h3>A Dream</h3>
<h3>A Glimpse Inside Yuqing Palace</h3>
<p>— Youqi</p>
<p>Ah! This is Yuqing Palace, as I just stepped inside, I discovered that it was clearly marked above the round hole.</p>
<p>In front of the dignified statue of the god, tall candle stands and incense tripods are erected. Their tops and insides are adorned with dots of fiery red and handfuls of incense sticks. The smoke from the candles and incense combines and rises gently. Due to the baptism of fire and smoke, the statue of the god, who enjoys the offerings, has lost its original color. At the same time, everything else in the hall enjoys the same treatment, blessed by the blessings of fortune.</p>
<p>"Would you like to order some incense and candles?" The incense and candle vendor in the hall constantly uses his amiable tone and smiling face to ask the men and women who come and go, especially the old women.</p>
<p>"Five bundles of incense, five pairs of candles," the believers hanging yellow cloth bags buy very generously. They worship, pray silently, and scatter the burning incense in their hands among the tripods of the gods. Furthermore, they uniformly allow the other side halls to enjoy the same treatment.</p>
<p>"Clatter, clatter," copper coins naturally fly from their hands into the round bamboo tube that stands beside the Buddha's table, having been soaked in incense for a long time.</p>
<p>"Kind ladies, may you be prosperous..." A well-trained beggar also squeezes in, begging behind these believers, hoping to gain some comforting ideal.</p>
<p>"Go away, nothing there,"</p>
<p>"Ah! Compassionate...doesn't care about this..." He continues to follow and plead.</p>
<p>"That is the Buddha! You..." Very lightly and naturally, it flows from the mouth of the middle-aged believer who had previously bought incense and is now stepping towards another hall.</p>
<p>Ah! He is probably sighing that he himself has not become a Buddha and cannot aspire to this sincere offering, right? Her figure is lost in the smoke, and he still gazes into the misty smoke.</p>

<h3>A Pitiful Rickshaw Puller</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>"I've been out for half a day today, and haven't earned a single cent. What will I eat when I go back?" A rickshaw puller, about forty years old, pulling a heavy rickshaw, walked slowly on the road, saying this to himself in frustration.</p>
<p>Just then, a well-dressed gentleman in a suit walked out from across the street. The rickshaw puller thought to himself, my savior has arrived, and quickly pulled the rickshaw to greet him.</p>
<p>"Sir! Where to? I'll pull you there!" the rickshaw puller asked this, hoping that the well-dressed gentleman would get into his rickshaw immediately.</p>
<p>"How much to the Tianchan Theatre?" the well-dressed gentleman asked. "I'll take you there! Thirty cents will do," the rickshaw puller replied.</p>
<p>"Twenty cents, will you go?" the well-dressed gentleman asked.</p>
<p>"Make it easy, give me twenty-three cents," the rickshaw puller replied.</p>
<p>"Not one more, if you don't go, forget it," the well-dressed gentleman said, and walked forward.</p>
<p>"What is one more cent to you?" the rickshaw puller pleaded.</p>
<p>The well-dressed gentleman ignored him and strode forward.</p>
<p>"Such a well-off gentleman, not willing to pay even three more cents, really is..." the rickshaw puller said to himself.</p>
<p>"Sir! Wait, I'll pull you for twenty cents," because he thought that he hadn't earned a single cent today, so he called out to the well-dressed gentleman and pulled the rickshaw to follow him. Just as he arrived, another rickshaw came from across the street.</p>
<p>"Tianchan Theatre, twenty cents, will you go?" the well-dressed gentleman asked that rickshaw puller.</p>
<p>"I'll take you!" that rickshaw puller replied.</p>
<p>"Sir, I was the one who agreed with you first," this rickshaw puller said, looking at the well-dressed gentleman.</p>
<p>"Aren't you going?" the well-dressed gentleman said angrily. He sat in that rickshaw, and that rickshaw puller pulled it away as if flying. This rickshaw puller watched the rickshaw disappear, then put down his rickshaw, lowered his head, and remained silent. After a while, his eyes turned red, and hot tears flowed out.</p>

<h3>Casual Jottings of the Fearless After Class</h3>
<p>Everyone says that "Sick Man of East Asia" is a shameful title, and to wash away this shame, of course, strengthening the physique is the most important thing. However, when it comes to military exercises, only half the people show up for the exercise.</p>
<p>"National crisis is pressing, stop entertainment," these two sentences can always be heard two or three times every day. However, when Saturday comes, the sound of "Going to see a movie?" constantly drills into my ears.</p>
<p>Everyone says, "Hurry up and focus! There's been too much neglect of classes this semester." However, during class, only the sound of talking can be heard. Although some seem to be very quiet, they have other special tasks.</p>
<p>Several female classmates often say that they want to eliminate cosmetics, but when Saturday comes, their faces have Paris face powder, bright red rouge, and lipstick. The amount of consumption must be considerable 丨丨</p>
<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<h3>The Effect of "Looking at Incense Heads"</h3>
<p>Warning the Foolish</p>
<p>Since the neighbor Mrs. Li's health deteriorated, her daughter "Rong" has been as anxious as an ant on a hot pot, spinning around in circles.</p>
<p>"Hey! Miss! I think you should ask the 'Incense Head Reader' 'Double Immortal' to come and look at the incense head, it's very interesting!" This was the Zhang family's maid Hu Ma, suggesting to "Rong."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by 'Double Immortal'? What exactly is 'Looking at Incense Heads'?" "Rong" asked her, full of surprise and curiosity.</p>
<p>"Well! 'Looking at Incense Heads' is one of the 'Double Immortal's' businesses. 'Double Immortals' are people who are born with two pupils in their eyes, so they can see everything in the underworld. Just light incense and candles, pray sincerely, and focus on the incense head, the images of gods, demons, ghosts, and monsters will appear completely, and thus judge people's fortunes and misfortunes. This is the most accurate. Now the × Immortal in × place is also a 'Double Immortal.' Its 'Looking at Incense Heads' is extraordinarily effective and famous far and wide. Why not invite them to try it out?" She explained the effectiveness of the "Double Immortal" and the benefits of "Looking at Incense Heads" in detail, praised the abilities of × Immortal, and strongly recommended it.</p>
<p>"Ah! Really? That's great. I'm so anxious that I don't know what to do, you go and invite them for me!" "Rong" was overjoyed and couldn't wait to call her to do it immediately. The next afternoon, × Immortal came as promised. All the arrangements for burning incense and lighting candles were complete, and "Rong" was also reverent and respectful, kneeling and praying, "Your family's ancestors have a wronged ghost who is entangled here. You must ask a 'Taoist priest' to capture them. In addition, you have offended the 'Fengdu Emperor,' the 'Northern Yin Funeral Department,' and the 'Teng Snake' and 'Five Saints'... all the gods. You must set up grand sacrifices and pray with great etiquette. At least you must thank the Bodhisattva with thirty-six tables. If you do this, I guarantee that the patient will immediately turn the corner and get well in three days." × Immortal, based on observations from the incense head, gave instructions one by one, and "Rong" followed them respectfully as if obeying an imperial edict.</p>
<p>In the evening, "Taoist priests" and "Taibao" 丨 These types are prevalent in the Punan area, specializing in thanking the Bodhisattva, 丨 came one after another, performing their work of "doing rituals" and "thanking the Bodhisattva." Therefore, gongs and drums shook the sky, and the Li residence was extraordinarily lively, and the expenses were also considerable.</p>
<p>When the "Taoist priests" and "Taibao" finished their work and left the scene, the old lady also passed away with a sigh, dying peacefully in her sleep.</p>
