<h3 id="c1">悼白里安 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>翰</p>
<p>素稱「世界和平天使」之白里安。已於前日逝世矣。噩耗傳來全球震動。而我酷愛和平之中華民族。適在强敵鐵蹄下圖掙扎。驟聞此哲人云亡。其悲感更何如耶。</p>
<p>白里安爲近世以來最奇特之政治家。前後組閣凡十一次。自一九二五年以迄最近。歷任外交部長。從無間斷。其人雄辩大略。更富理想。故不特爲法國國民所愛戴。抑且爲世界人士所推重。早年曾任新聞記者。與歐戰前主張非戰最烈之法社會黨領袖查萊士曾一度合作辦報。其後和平思想之發達。受查萊士之影響甚深。白氏生平有記錄之價值者。累累可成巨秩。祇就其關於世界和平事業之創造論。已足供吾人之無限推崇。羅加諾條約之簽訂德國之加入聯盟。莫非白氏一人斡旋之力。年來且進一步發表歐洲聯盟之計劃。欲使歐洲之和平。樹立永久磐石之基礎。繼囂俄之遺志。不僅無愧於「詩人外交家］之稱。</p>
<p>吾人對白氏之逝世。所以不勝其哀悼者。尤以白氏爲主張和平最堅之一人也。自九一八禍變以後。國聯行政會第一次接受中日事件。白氏以事不及參加。二三兩次皆由白氏主持。第三次在巴黎開會。白氏扶病出席。鞠躬盡瘁。其維持和平之苦心。亦可謂無以復加矣。乃竟無以挽回日方强硬之主張。轉移國際聯盟之難局。雖素稱國際上排難解紛之斵輪老手。至此亦徒喚奈何。最近賴伐爾閣潮。白氏乘機下野。從此國際舞臺上不見白氏之踪影。日内瓦議塲上。更不能領略白氏之言論丰采。最近白氏病重時。猶眷眷以東亞和平爲念及其死也。舉世各國無不表示哀悼。即德國之白魯寗。亦深致其惋惜之意舉世之所以崇仰白氏。非僅崇仰白氏之人格。更崇仰白氏之以身殉和平也。而今後。誰能繼起保障和平。爲國際聯盟之保姆耶。　　當一九二五年十月。布希糾紛時。白里安任國聯行政會主席。即曾發表堅决之主張。［一民族如感有外患之逼迫。苦訴國聯。行政會必挺身而出。大聲曰有吾在。排難解紛。何欋之有。］今竟以未能實践其志。而憂鬰以終。我人留此悲痛之印象眼前。更一聯想及於世界和平之危險。誠不能不悲從中來唏嘘不置也。</p>

        <h1>1932.03.09</h1>
<h3 id="e1">In Memory of Briand <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Han</p>
<p>Briand, known as the "Angel of World Peace," passed away the day before yesterday. The sad news shook the world. And the Chinese nation, which deeply loves peace and is struggling under the iron heel of a strong enemy, felt even more grief upon hearing of the death of this philosopher.</p>
<p>Briand was the most extraordinary statesman of modern times. He formed cabinets eleven times. From 1925 until recently, he served as Foreign Minister without interruption. He was eloquent, strategic, and full of ideals. Therefore, he was not only loved by the French people but also respected by people around the world. In his early years, he was a journalist and once co-edited a newspaper with Jaurès, the leader of the French Socialist Party who most strongly advocated against war before the European War. Later, his peace ideals were deeply influenced by Jaurès. Briand's life has countless events worthy of recording, enough to fill volumes. Just his contributions to the cause of world peace are enough for us to admire him endlessly. The signing of the Locarno Treaties and Germany's entry into the League of Nations were all due to Briand's mediation. In recent years, he further proposed a plan for a European Union, seeking to establish a permanent foundation for peace in Europe. Continuing the legacy of Xiao E, he was not only worthy of the title "Poet Diplomat."</p>
<p>Our grief over Briand's death is especially profound because he was one of the strongest advocates for peace. After the September 18th Incident, the Council of the League of Nations first accepted the Sino-Japanese issue. Briand did not participate in the first meeting. Briand presided over the second and third meetings. He attended the third meeting in Paris despite being ill, dedicating himself to the task. His dedication to maintaining peace can be said to have been unparalleled. However, he was ultimately unable to reverse Japan's strong stance or shift the difficult situation of the League of Nations. Even as an experienced troubleshooter in international affairs, he could only lament his powerlessness. Recently, with the Laval cabinet's downfall, Briand seized the opportunity to step down. Since then, Briand's presence has been absent from the international stage. Briand's speeches and demeanor could no longer be appreciated at the Geneva conference. Even when Briand was seriously ill recently, he was still concerned about peace in East Asia. Upon his death, countries around the world expressed their condolences. Even Brüning of Germany deeply expressed his regret. The world's admiration for Briand is not only for his personality but also for his dedication to peace. In the future, who can step up to safeguard peace and be the guardian of the League of Nations? In October 1925, during the Buxi dispute, Briand, as Chairman of the Council of the League of Nations, made a firm statement: "If a nation feels threatened by external enemies and appeals to the League of Nations, the Council must step forward and loudly say, 'I am here. What difficulty is there that cannot be resolved?'" Now, he has ended his life in sorrow because he could not fulfill his aspirations. The painful impression remains in our minds, and when we think of the dangers to world peace, we cannot help but feel grief from the bottom of our hearts.</p>

<p>Military Headquarters Announces Battle Report</p>
<p>Situation at Huangdu and Zhujia Bridge</p>
<p>The rear office of the 19th Route Army received a telegram from Zhao Yijian, Chief of Staff at the front, at 6:00 PM on the 8th, stating: 1) Over a thousand enemy troops attacked Huangdu on the 6th, and were met with a head-on attack by our ○ Division ○ Regiment, suffering heavy casualties. The battle lasted until the evening of the 7th, when the enemy was defeated and retreated to Nanxiang. 2) This morning (8th), over four hundred enemy soldiers returned to Huangdu for reconnaissance and then retreated. 3) On the Jiading front, an enemy regiment attacked Zhujia Bridge on the morning of the 7th, and our troops engaged them in a fierce battle all day. As a result, the enemy troops were defeated and retreated this morning (8th) in a very disheveled state. An agency obtained information from the front yesterday (8th) at 4:45 PM that approximately 300-400 Japanese cavalry troops attacked Liudubridge east of Taicang. Fierce fighting is currently in progress.</p>

<h3 id="e4">No Fighting at Qingyang Port <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>According to a worker who escaped from a certain agency in Jiading yesterday, Japanese troops have placed heavy artillery at all four gates of Jiading. The headquarters is located inside the county government, and civilians are forced to go to the headquarters to obtain badges in order to move freely. Many White Russians and Jiangbei people are among the Japanese troops, all wearing Japanese uniforms. The outposts outside the west gate extend to the outer port, which is about twenty miles from the city of Jiading. The Japanese headquarters is concentrated in Nanxiang, and the outposts extend six to seven miles west of Huangdu. Our army's forward outposts are one to two miles southeast, with trenches prepared and ready for battle. As for the rumors of fighting at Qingyang Port and other places, they are completely inaccurate.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Only Minor Contact at Liuhe <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The "Da Mei Evening News" reported that the claim that Chinese troops were taking an offensive in the west and northwest of Liuhe was denied this morning (8th) by the spokesman of the Chinese military authorities, and has not been confirmed by reliable neutral authorities. It is heard that at a certain location southwest of Liuhe, the Chinese and Japanese outposts are less than a few hundred yards apart, and there was some gunfire yesterday, but of no fighting nature. The Japanese communique stated that yesterday they saw a column of Chinese soldiers advancing northwest towards Liuhe, encountering Japanese sentries six kilometers from the riverbank. The Chinese soldiers fired, but the Japanese sentries did not return fire. The Chinese authorities stated that after a brief exchange of gunfire, both sides retreated beyond rifle range.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Qingpu as Peaceful as Usual <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>After recent rumors of Japanese planes going to Qingpu for reconnaissance and arson by Jiangbei plainclothes teams in the city, fellow Qingpu natives in Shanghai were alarmed. According to Mr. Xu from Qingpu, who arrived in Shanghai around 3 PM yesterday morning (8th) after taking a boat from Qingpu to Songjiang and changing to a train, Qingpu is currently as peaceful as usual. However, many people have sought refuge in Qingpu from Jiading, Taicang, and other places. There are now three or four shelters. The reported fire in the city was caused by carelessness, and there was no arson by plainclothes teams. The waterway between Shanghai and Qingpu is open, and small boats are running as usual. The city and countryside have strict defenses, and public security is not a concern.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Japanese Military Actions in Western Shanghai <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 1:30 PM, 26 Japanese soldiers, two holding submachine guns, and the rest with rifles, crossed the bridge on Zhongshan Road, proceeded west along the Suzhou River to Zhoujia Bridge on Jessfield Road, then via Brenan Road to Beixinjing, crossed Macleod Road and Hardoon Road, turned north on Hongqiao Road, and returned to Zhongshan Road and the bridge. There were no conflicts with Chinese police officers on duty along the way.</p>

<p>It has been confirmed that our country's troops have been withdrawn from the areas of Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei. All matters relating to public safety, sanitation, and public services in those areas should continue to be maintained. It is the responsibility of this government to instruct the relevant authorities to handle them separately. Since there are still troops from your country stationed in the aforementioned areas, in order to avoid misunderstandings, this letter is hereby sent to you. Please investigate and inform your country's military authorities to give a reply. Respectfully, to Murai Kuramatsu, Consul-General of Japan stationed in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Nanshi as Peaceful as Usual <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou trains run twice a day, local security maintained by police</p>
<p>Yesterday, rumors were rampant in Nanshi. Western newspapers even reported that the Nanshi railway station had moved its operations to Songjiang. The reporter from the Guowen News Agency made a special inspection of various parts of Nanshi in the afternoon. Not only was the area as peaceful as usual, but the Shanghai-Hangzhou trains were still departing and arriving twice a day. The details obtained are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e13">Minkuo Road <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Minkuo Road and Xiaodongmen in the Southern District are adjacent to the French Concession, making disputes likely. Therefore, the defenses constructed on both sides by the Japanese troops after the start of the war are still in place at key thoroughfares. Entering the Chinese territory from the concession, or going from the Chinese territory to the concession, requires strict inspection by the Chinese and French police authorities. The iron gates of the French Concession are opened at 7 AM every morning, with the side gates unobstructed. Pedestrians can pass from east to west, including sixteen shops along the riverbank, the Xiaodongmen tram station, Xin Kaihe, Lao Beimen, Xixin Bridge Street, Xiaobei Men, Nanyang Bridge and seven or eight other locations. Vehicles are only allowed to enter and exit through Nanyang Bridge. The three tram lines of the French Concession are not running in the morning. The five tram lines going south turn around at the Xinya Men stop next to the Xiaobei Men iron gate. The section in Ximen has also been suspended. The Public Security Team patrols Minkuo Road with flags, constantly moving back and forth, fearing that petty criminals may be carrying dangerous goods into the territory. Therefore, the Southern District Security Corps conducts spot checks on those with suspicious behavior at the Fangbang Bridge to the south. Although the market is very depressed, the streets are still crowded with pedestrians. Small businesses are still operating. Formal troops are not seen, presumably they have all retreated south.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Shiliupu <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Shiliupu is adjacent to the Huangpu River. Before the 19th Route Army retreated from Zhabei, the tax police regiment stationed in Nanshi had built very strong defensive works along the riverbank, such as the Dada Pier, Dongjiadu Shanghai Hospital, and Nan Pier. Now that the troops have retreated inland, the sandbags still shield the area along the riverbank. All the stationed soldiers have also been replaced by the Public Security Team and the Merchant Corps. It is no longer possible to find a large cargo ship at the pier that used to have thousands of masts. Most of the small boats docked there are like refugees, with nowhere to escape, and many are Jiangbei boats that use the boats as homes. The timber yards nearby, which usually stack timber by the riverbank, have now become natural defenses. Even bundles of planks are covered with sandbags. Since the timber yards do not have a large enough place to store the materials, it seems that they do not care about this small matter at this time of national crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Nanshi Railway Station <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway's Nanshi Railway Station continued to operate as usual after our troops retreated to Nanxiang on the night of the first day of the month. On the fourth day, due to rumors and panic, the station staff was temporarily moved to Xinzhuang. Outsiders were unaware of this, and refugees felt as though they could not go on. On the sixth day, in order to facilitate the refugees and stabilize public morale, the railway bureau immediately returned to the South Station. Therefore, the passenger trains running twice a day, in the morning and afternoon, have been operating as usual for the past two days.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Longhua Area <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The reporter passed through Gaochang Temple and turned towards Longhua. The market was depressed and the streets were deserted. It is noted that there were three to five members of the Public Security Team on duty at Jianqiao Bridge to the south. Only pedestrians are allowed there, and vehicles are not allowed. All vehicles must detour to Xinxiqu Fenlin Bridge and turn into the French Concession. In short, the defense in various parts of the Southern District is very tight, and it is even more peaceful than when Zhabei was under artillery fire. Alarming rumors are not credible.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Sanitation Work in Zhabei <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Fessenden Indicates Unwillingness to Unilaterally Manage</p>
<p>But May Be Forced to Temporarily Undertake</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reported that the Zhabei district, after a month of war, has no sanitation to speak of. If excrement is not removed immediately, it will be detrimental to the well-being of the residents of the Public Concession, especially those areas adjacent to Zhabei, such as the Old Zhabei district and the New Zhabei district. Yesterday, Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, stated that the Municipal Council may be forced to temporarily undertake sanitation work in the Zhabei area along the border of the Public Concession. The Municipal Council is unwilling to interfere in matters outside the boundaries of the concession, but for the sake of the well-being of the concession, it is urgent to restore sanitation measures in the Zhabei district. It would be best for the Chinese authorities to request the Municipal Council to assist in this matter. However, at present, the Municipal Council is unwilling to take on any responsibilities in any area outside the boundaries of the concession without the permission of the Chinese authorities, even temporarily. The Municipal Council does not want to unilaterally manage any Chinese territory over which the bureau has no legal jurisdiction. However, if it becomes absolutely necessary, it may be forced to address the health hazards to residents within the Public Concession. In this situation, the political ramifications will have to be considered later, as it is imperative to consider the well-being of all residents. The Chinese authorities have not yet sought assistance from the Municipal Council, but there is nothing that can be done. From the perspective of the Chinese inspectors, the Japanese troops stationed in Zhabei are a major obstacle to the return of the Chinese to Zhabei. The actions of the Chinese officials depend on the attitude of the Japanese. However, the unsanitary state of Zhabei cannot be allowed to continue. If the Chinese do not take responsibility for removing excrement, then others will have to take on this responsibility, etc.</p>

<p>Most of the Buildings in the Town Were Burned Down</p>
<p>Since the Japanese troops attacked Jiangwan, the once prosperous area has now become scorched earth. A reporter from the Nichinichi Shimbun drove from Hongzhen to Jiangwan yesterday morning at 10 AM, detouring. Countless refugees had to undergo strict searches by Japanese troops and Chinese traitors when returning to the Wusong and Jiangwan areas. Only those deemed to be free of suspicion were allowed to pass. The details of the investigation yesterday are recorded below:</p>

<p>When the reporter's car reached Hongqiao Town, a person resembling a Japanese officer was seen leading several people wearing Japanese uniforms, stopping pedestrians. They were asked, "Where are you from? Where are you going?" After a detailed search, only those deemed to be free of suspicion were allowed to pass. The reporter was also subjected to the same interrogation, but fortunately, preparations had been made in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Labor University Destroyed <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Upon arriving at Jiangwan Town, the towering clock tower that once reached the clouds was now nothing but a pile of scorched earth. A corner of a dangerous building remained on the northeast corner, standing alone. Only a corner of the station remains. The tracks have been repaired. A section of a small train is still parked at the station. The rows of willows across the street were broken beyond recognition. The fields are full of bomb craters, which were dropped by Japanese planes during the battle. Most heartbreakingly, several skeletons have become white bones, seemingly abandoned by wild dogs.</p>
<h3 id="e21">The Entire Town Turned to Scorched Earth <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Passing through Labor University and turning into Jiangwan Town, the area has been completely destroyed. The Wanle Bridge area is all scorched earth. East Street and Dasiqian, the most prosperous areas of the town, are now desolate. Only a few firewalls remain. Several small houses and a new house in the North Lane were spared and did not have a single bullet mark. As the reporter passed through the area, several Japanese officers galloped by on horseback.</p>

<p>The water in the river in Jiangwan Town is smelly and reddish-brown. There are two corpses floating in the small river in front of the Dongyue Temple, both facing upwards with severed heads, seemingly thrown into the river after death. In front of a certain lumber yard, there is the corpse of a young child. In the river in front of the Niulang Temple, there are several corpses of soldiers that have not yet been retrieved and buried. Chinese and Japanese troops had held out there for several days. There are many bullet marks and the trenches still remain. The river water has turned bluish-purple and smells fishy and unbearable. There are also many military supplies that have not yet been collected.</p>

<p>National Salvation United Association - The Shanghai Organizations National Salvation United Association decided at its 12th executive director meeting yesterday to send Mr. Tan Bozhi and Mr. Wang Kecheng to the headquarters of the 19th Route Army at the front lines to offer condolences, and to visit the chambers of commerce and lawyers associations of Wuxian, Wuxi, and Changzhou to discuss assisting soldiers and handling rear affairs. Mr. Tan and others are scheduled to depart this morning and will return to Shanghai in about a week. The letter of condolence to the 19th Route Army is recorded below: Sirs, the Japanese pirates are invading Shanghai, and gods and men are angered. Fortunately, your army has resisted with all its might and shed blood on the battlefield for more than a month, and has already gained a considerable position in national defense. The people at home and abroad support you. Unexpectedly, the government did not send reinforcements, causing the Japanese army to sneak into Liuhe and attack our backs. Your army temporarily shortened the front line due to strategic considerations. This is a necessary plan in military terms and is deeply understood by our people. In addition to sending telegrams to the government to quickly order the dispatch of reinforcements, and separately requesting various organizations at home and abroad to provide unified assistance, this association is now sending Mr. Tan Bozhi and Mr. Wang Kecheng to the front lines to express the sincerity of the 3 million people of Shanghai who support you from beginning to end, and to rush to the Suzhou and Changzhou areas to awaken the people to go to the national crisis and do their best to provide relief so that they can wait for an opportunity to counterattack and recover the lost territory. The country is fortunate, the people are fortunate. Respectfully addressed to the 19th Route Army, Shanghai Organizations National Salvation United Association, March 8.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee of the Whampoa Military Academy Alumni Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps, Jiang Cai, and others sent a telegram: General Commander Jiang, Commander Cai, Commander Dai, and all the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army - Japan disregards humanitarianism and justice, destroys world peace, and has not only seized our Eastern Provinces but also invaded our Songhu. Your army is loyal and brave, defending the country, resisting the Japanese army, and fighting fiercely for more than a month, achieving remarkable feats. Your bravery and good fighting are known at home and abroad. The good news has been spread, and all are pleased and gratified. Because the government did not send reinforcements, resulting in a disparity in numbers, it was forced to endure the pain and withdraw from the front line. Reading the pleadings, we are filled with anger and resentment. All members of this corps swear to live and die with your officers and soldiers, and we hope that you will persevere in your original intention, maintain an unyielding spirit, and win the final victory. We hereby send a telegram of condolence. May you understand, He Jingmin, Zhu Yecang, Chen Guangya, Li Tianzhao, Xu Ruiheng, Lou Shengli, Chen Zhiqiang, and all 400 members of the Whampoa Military Academy Alumni Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps respectfully kowtow.</p>

<p>Gangglin Returns Home Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that Méré, the new French Consul-General in Shanghai, and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday (7th) on the "Rousseau". Important French members of the consulate, the military, and the Public Works Bureau went to the wharf to welcome them and sent land and sea soldiers and police to stand in formation to show respect. Last night, the colleagues of the Public Works Bureau hosted a banquet at the French Club to welcome the new Consul-General and to bid farewell to the old Consul-General Gangglin and Superintendent Fevrier, and invited dignitaries from diplomatic, military, and political circles, as well as well-known gentry and merchants to accompany them.

<h3 id="e28">Song Ziwen Announces the Customs Revenue and Expenditure Figures for February <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Song Ziwen telegraphed all ministries, military commissions, pacification directors, provincial governments, city governments, general commanders, army commanders, division commanders, newspapers, provincial and municipal chambers of commerce, and educational organizations, that since the National Government accepted the bond maintenance method proposed by the ticket holders' association, the monthly bond fund has been reduced to 8.6 million yuan. If this is done, the principal and interest of domestic debts can continue to be paid. However, although the bond fund has been reduced, the government has not actually had any surplus funds that can be used for support. Since the great flood was followed by the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, customs duties have plummeted, exceeding the amount of the reduced bond fund. Therefore, after reducing the bond fund, the entire customs revenue is only enough to pay for reparations and various internal and external debts, and there is no surplus to speak of. As for the rumors that the Boxer Indemnity has been suspended, that is absolutely not true. Various Boxer Indemnity payments are still being made as usual.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Inspector General of Customs, the total customs revenue for February, including both old and new portions, amounted to 12,516,037.17 taels of Haikwan silver. The total expenditure for February was 13,833,778.05 taels of Haikwan silver. The deficit was 1,317,740.88 taels of Haikwan silver, which was made up from the reserve fund. The customs revenue and expenditure figures for February are listed below:</p>
<p>Income</p>
<p>Total Customs Revenue: 12,516,037.17 taels of Haikwan silver</p>

<h3 id="e30">Talk Regarding the Situation of Foreign Merchants Surveying the Burnt-Down Site of the Commercial Press General Factory <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Commercial Press General Factory was bombed by Japanese troops this time, occupying a vast area with a wide variety of machinery, raw materials, and inventory. The loss is appalling. For more than a month, this newspaper has repeatedly recorded the war achievements. Everyone praised the 19th Route Army for their loyalty, bravery, and skill in defense. When discussing the tragic destruction of factories in Zhabei, they all said that the Commercial Press, as a cultural institution, was also brutally devastated, causing everyone to express their regret. The machinery used by the company had been purchased and replaced over many years and were all high-quality European and American products. The foreign merchants in Shanghai who had been involved in installing the machinery for the General Factory were eager to inspect the situation. They visited the site for surveys in the past two days. According to them, they drove from North Sichuan Road to the intersection of Qiujiang Road and then walked, turning into Zhabei. They originally hoped to go straight to the back gate of the General Factory of the Press via Guangdong Street, which would have been quicker, but unfortunately, due to the unfinished obstruction engineering from the fighting, they could not pass. So, they detoured along Qiujiang Road westward, crossed the Songhu Railway, turned into Baotong Road, and entered the site through the side gate of the factory. The situation of the surveyed areas is as follows: (1) The staff sanatorium is still intact. (2) The oil manufacturing department was completely destroyed. (3) The cutting and binding department (formerly the China East Machinery Factory) had all its paper stocks burned, and dozens of large and small cutting and binding machines were destroyed. (4) The machine repair department is still intact. (5) Three large paper warehouses and one large book paper warehouse, storing various paper materials and books, were all burned to ashes. The paper ash was so deep that it reached the knees. The remaining debris from the roofs and walls was piled up on the road, making it difficult to walk. (6) In the engraving department, the copper, zinc, and lead plates stored inside were completely melted due to intense burning, flowing out of the building and forming fragments. The three-story giant building was like an empty shell. (7) The plate casting department seemed to be still intact. (8) The instrument and stationery warehouse was completely destroyed. (9) The woodworking department was completely destroyed. (10) The First and Second Printing Plants were the main printing sections of the factory, consisting of two large rows of long two-story buildings. There were hundreds of machines, large and small, each worth tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars. They were destroyed along with the buildings, which was one of the biggest losses for the company. Leaving the First Printing Plant, there was a road leading to the main gate of the General Factory, but there was no way to reach the First Printing Plant from the main gate. Similarly, the cutting and binding department mentioned in item (3) also had a road leading to the main gate of the General Factory, but unfortunately, it was covered with barbed wire by the army. Therefore, they walked out from the back gate of the General Factory (the back gate faces the main gate and runs through the center of the factory, about 500 meters long), turned from Baoyuan Road to Baotong Road, and walked through the side gate to Baoshan Road. Looking north, the Translation and Compilation Institute, Correspondence School, various magazine offices, the Oriental Library, Shang Gong Primary School, and the factory's off-site book warehouse (formerly the Moudeley Organ Factory building) were all that remained: dilapidated walls, rubble, ash, and debris. The situation seen from the main gate is as follows: (11) The general book warehouse and the book storage buildings were all destroyed, similar to the paper warehouses. (12) The publishing department and consignment sales department were both destroyed. (13) The specimen and model manufacturing department and the magazine distribution office were all destroyed, along with the buildings, drawings, and name lists. (14) The cutting and binding sub-department (the old Translation and Compilation Institute building), machinery, and the three-story building were completely burned down. (15) The Third Printing Plant, also a three-story building, where the main work was monochrome lithography and the English typesetting department was located, was also completely destroyed. (16) The Fourth Printing Plant, a four-story building with the office and business department on the lower floor, and dozens of the factory's main color and fine printing machines on the second and third floors, and the entire company's general affairs department on the top floor, were all destroyed. The loss in this section was also extremely large. After surveying all the above locations one by one, I deeply lamented that the General Factory of the Press had suffered such a great calamity and that nothing remained. The remaining debris was not worth even two or three percent of the factory's value. Although I am a foreigner, I cannot help but feel heartbroken at this tragic sight. It is truly a case of using every extreme measure to achieve a malicious end. What a pity! What a pity! After the inspection, we left the factory and walked south along Baoshan Road, turning west into Baotong Road. Many of the houses along the road were destroyed, but not as badly as Qiujiang Road, the eastern section of Baotong Road, and Baoshan Road. Further west, we reached Tiantong'an Road, where the printing branch of the Press was located. The branch factory occupied an area of about four mu (the General Factory occupied an area of about one hundred mu). The scale was not large, and the value of the machinery and inventory was not high, but the contents were not severely damaged. The building had several holes pierced by shells. A major incident occurred in the surrounding area, but it was said that the fire was extinguished by the Public Concession Fire Brigade and was not affected, which was fortunate. The factory is now practically unable to send people to guard it and pay attention to fire prevention. It is also unknown whether it will be burned again in the future.</p>

<p>No Military Installations Along the Coastline</p>
<p>Two Japanese military officers in plainclothes arrived at the Nichihua Cotton Mill in Pudong by small steamer the other day. They sent someone to invite Zhang Mingqin, the chief of the Third District of the local Public Security Bureau, and Xu Baoming, the head of the Security Corps, to the factory for discussions. Zhang and others immediately went to the factory with their staff. The Japanese military officers first questioned why there were troops stationed in Pudong and why trenches were being dug, making various military preparations. They also pointed out that someone had planted mines in the river some days ago, coming from the Pudong side. The district chief replied that the Pudong coastline was lined with foreign factories and warehouses, which were closely protected by local police and security corps members, and no accidents had occurred. Since the Shanghai Incident, no troops had been stationed along the Pudong coastline, and there were no preparations for digging trenches. Furthermore, the police guarding the ferries along the coast were strict, and no one would dare to carry mines into the water. These were obvious facts. Upon hearing this, the Japanese military officers requested permission to go for a survey. The district chief said that public sentiment was high, and there might be unexpected incidents due to misunderstandings, and he could not be responsible for that. The Japanese military officers insisted that the district chief protect them and let them have a look so that they could report back. District Chief Zhang accompanied the Japanese military officers from Lujiazui along the coast northward, passing through the Taitung Wharf, Qichang Warehouse, and Mitsui Warehouse. They realized that there were indeed no military installations. They then thanked him and left.</p>

Yesterday, another three boatloads of clothing, food, and sundries were shipped to the front lines. The Chamber also allocated a large number of military blankets, sanitary clothing, gas masks, and raincoats to the Civilian Volunteer Army, which were loaded onto a boat and sent to the army.</p>

<p>According to a report by Mr. Borland, a lawyer for the Public Works Department, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese military conflict, the Shanghai Special District Court and the Second Higher Branch Court have been located no more than 400 yards from the front line. The sound of gunshots and artillery fire sometimes made it difficult for people in the courtroom to understand the words of the court. However, the court continued to operate as usual. However, in order to avoid stray bullets, sandbags were placed on the windows of the fourth and fifth floors. It is estimated that in February of this year, a total of 1,666 cases were filed, which is a huge difference compared to the 5,112 cases in the same month of the previous year. These are all criminal cases. As for the Civil Division, it was almost at a standstill. There was little income from civil litigation fees, and criminal fines also decreased, so the court's income was greatly reduced. It is estimated that there were the most robbery cases this month, mostly occurring in the Hongkou area. The court has dealt with them severely in accordance with the law. A total of 1,035 cases were concluded this month, with 961 people sentenced and 74 people released. There were a total of 22 appeal cases, 21 of which have been processed. As of the end of the month, there were 105 appeal cases pending and another 5 miscellaneous cases.</p>

<p>The China Public School replied to the Ministry of Education telegram, stating that the telegrams from Minister Zhu and Vice Minister Duan of the National Government Ministry of Education in Kyoto and Luoyang have been received. The Japanese pirates disregarded public agreements this time, invading Songhu, massacring our compatriots, and destroying our cultural institutions. Anyone with blood and qi is filled with righteous indignation. The China Public School, which our country's scholars have painstakingly managed for more than two years, has been almost completely destroyed by artillery shells. Not only has the loss of school equipment, school buildings, books, and machinery been about a million, but more than a thousand teachers, staff, and students remaining at the school have also fled in a hurry, displaced. Now the Wusong location of the school has been occupied by enemy troops, and the remaining school buildings and dormitories will likely not be preserved. Education is the foundation of the country. Therefore, we cannot stop because of changes. We have temporarily rented school buildings at No. 1260 Lafayette Road in the French Concession and started school as usual. In addition to awaiting the end of the war, clarifying the losses, and reporting separately to request compensation from the enemy, we are grateful for the telegram of慰劳. Sincerely reply, China Public School, Yang Kouchong.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Important Domestic and Foreign Telegrams League of Nations Conference Still No Results <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Neither Concluded Discussion Nor Agreed on Any Resolution; Meeting to Resume Tomorrow</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council adjourned at 3:30 PM this afternoon, neither concluding its discussions nor agreeing on any resolution. The meeting will reconvene tomorrow (March 8th). Currently, eight more representatives have declared their desire to speak at the meeting. Noteworthy in today's meeting was the lengthy speech by British Foreign Secretary Simon, who advocated continued mediation in order to seek a solution to the current difficulties and requested that Yan Huiqing and Matsudaira solemnly acknowledge the fundamental principles of the League of Nations. The main theme of Simon's speech was the spirit of goodwill with which the League of Nations was created. Simon placed the weight of British influence on the side of mediation as a way to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. Simon claimed that he knew that what was involved in the situation was not only peace in the Far East, but also the future of the League of Nations. He heard the remarks of Swiss representative Motta and other representatives, all of whom believed that the primary responsibility of the League of Nations Council under Chapter 15 of the Covenant was mediation, and that this was also the case under other international treaties. He now felt that the importance of these remarks was not diminished by the outbreak of large-scale hostilities. Paragraph 3 of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that the League of Nations Administrative Council should strive to resolve disputes, and paragraph 9 gives the parties the right to submit disputes to the League of Nations Council. Therefore, Dr. Yan's submission of the Sino-Japanese question to the Council was within his power. However, the first obligation of the Administrative Council is to reach a settlement, and the hope that its efforts can succeed should not be regarded as completely exhausted, but must continue. The future of the League of Nations is certainly cause for concern, but representatives with the authority and responsibility of both sides are present here as friendly comrades, and members of the League of Nations who have a special relationship with Shanghai also have the convenience of facilitating negotiations and observing developments locally. At the same time, the United States is also cooperating with us, and reconciliation does not seem difficult, although it may take a long time, but this should be our primary purpose. If the Council makes an announcement before the League of Nations Commission of Inquiry is proceeding and the League has not received full case files from both sides, it would seem to violate the first principle of fairness. Therefore, the Council must await a complete investigation into the rights and wrongs of the dispute. Czech representative Pienshi's remarks on the special difficulties of the Far Eastern situation were deeply felt by him. He had no objection to the proposed method of handling this matter. The method of announcement should not be to judge the merits of this dispute, but to determine how to resolve this dispute. Simon then turned to Dr. Yan and Matsudaira and said, "My little friends, please solemnly acknowledge the principles on which the League of Nations is based and the Paris Pact. This is the step that we can and should take at present. Even if the League of Nations fails to make people respect its principles, it is better for the League of Nations to declare its principles than to abandon its principles due to unconscious arguments." Simon's remarks attracted very close attention and clearly made a deep impression. Shortly after, the meeting adjourned. The remaining speakers were Panama representative Calais, French representative Peng Gu, and Italian representative Rosso. Calais advocated upholding the principle of territorial integrity and inviolability, and praised the British Foreign Secretary Simon's efforts in the Shanghai truce. French representative Peng Gu said that any resolution passed by the League of Nations Council, whose main purpose is to stop the war and safeguard the dignity of the League of Nations Covenant, he would definitely agree to. He had not yet heard of any suggestions that exceeded what the Administrative Council had tried. On the eve of the Council meeting, the war had already stopped. Even if this was not a complete result, it was a tangible result. Now, the first effort should be directed towards easing the situation through a truce, which could resolve the Shanghai problem. As for the other issues, in his opinion, they were connected to the report of the League of Nations Manchurian Commission of Inquiry. Italian representative Rosso read a telegram from Shanghai, which stated that the Japanese army had stopped advancing 20 kilometers from Shanghai and had not contacted the Chinese army since then. Although Italy had special interests in China, it was willing to deal with the current dispute with a cautious and impartial attitude. He deeply knew the importance of what Sir Simon had said that the Council should first exercise its power in accordance with paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant to engage in reconciliation. He also agreed with Peng Gu's proposal to hold a round table conference to restore peace in Shanghai. This procedure, supplemented by the work of the Commission of Inquiry led by Lytton, should provide a good opportunity for resolution. Dr. Yan told Reuters reporters after the meeting that Sir Simon's arguments were good, but not thorough enough. He considered the remarks in the meeting today to be empty. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the League of Nations Council reconvened at 3:45 PM this afternoon, it adopted a proposal to send a special delegation of the Council to attend Briand's funeral, led by Council President Hymans and League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond. Next, British representative Simon read a telegram from British Ambassador to China Lambson, regretting that the information on the state of war was not detailed, stating that it was difficult to obtain accurate information because Shanghai was far from the front line. In the future, the four countries would work together to seek concrete information and report it daily. French representative Peng Gu welcomed this statement, saying that the League of Nations was gradually forging the tools for application. Hymans asked the meeting to pay attention to the slow progress of the Council's preliminary work. If the speakers did not speak briefly, it would be delayed until next week. Next, Irish representative Lester elaborated on the benefits of mediation. He believed that the Sino-Japanese dispute could be resolved through mediation. Lester also advocated upholding the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. If there were any violations, the Council should insist on solemn principles and order the parties involved to comply. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the League of Nations Council met today, Polish representative Zaleski also expressed his opinion, saying that Poland, due to its geographical location, was particularly concerned about peace in the Far East and respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of League of Nations member states. Therefore, it welcomed the guarantee given by Japanese representative Sato that Japan did not want to quickly violate the fundamental obligations of the League of Nations. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>German and Italian Representatives Demand Abolition of Military Aircraft</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Bureau of the Disarmament Conference met this morning for a long time, specifically to review the list of proposals prepared by Rapporteur Benes. The Bureau approved the first list, which should be submitted to the various committees for review. It included the principles of reducing armaments, the standards for limiting armaments, and whether or not to consider the different circumstances of each country. During the discussion, the German representative requested that the principle of reducing armaments to the lowest limit be added to the above issues. With the agreement of the majority, it was included in the list, but not submitted to the General Affairs Committee for review. Then, the German and Italian representatives again requested that the issue of abolishing military aircraft be added to the list of principles. Thereupon, representatives from Norway and other countries also stood up to express their opinions. Then, the Bureau approved the Benes list, together with the amendments proposed by the various delegations. In addition, there were several other issues that should be submitted to the General Committee for review. Another list was opened and passed. The General Committee is scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday morning. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Yan Huiqing has a long telegram report. In addition to recording the debate at the meeting, he also has insights on the League of Nations situation and the Shanghai case. The main points are summarized as follows: 1. This truce is in acceptance of the League of Nations' advice. If Japanese conditions are accepted alone at this time, the League of Nations meeting would be meaningless. Sino-Japanese negotiations should be held only after the League of Nations Commission of Inquiry arrives in Shanghai for investigation. 2. There is not much difference between the General Assembly's report on various sections of our country and the four reports of the Shanghai Consular Corps to the League of Nations. There is no doubt about their sympathy for us. 3. The General Assembly has proven that all the remarks of Japanese diplomats are not related to the actions of military leaders in Shanghai. Finally, he said that if Japan could first withdraw its troops occupying our territory, it would not be impossible to open negotiations first. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Meetings Only After Japanese Troops Withdraw</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiang Zuobin discussed the Shanghai incident and the attitude taken by our country in foreign affairs. First, our country has expressed its acceptance of the new resolution unanimously passed by the League of Nations Special Meeting. However, what needs to be reserved is that the resolution of the Shanghai issue cannot be attached with any conditions and cannot be accepted before the Japanese troops withdraw from the defense line. Regarding the so-called round table discussion, the basic principle of our country in the Shanghai case is that it cannot be threatened and there can be no acts that humiliate the country and infringe upon its rights. It is also necessary to clarify the responsibility for this incident and the issue of compensation. Second, after China and Japan accept the League of Nations resolution, the steps for the withdrawal of Japanese troops will be discussed under the supervision of the Sino-Japanese military authorities in Shanghai and the countries concerned. After the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn, a round table conference will be convened to discuss the issue of the entire city of Shanghai. The second step is to resolve the Dongsan Province incident. Third, the League of Nations Special Assembly should not close until the Sino-Japanese incident has reached a considerable stage. The strength of the League of Nations must be determined by whether or not it can resolve the Sino-Japanese incident. Fourth, Representative Yan has stated to the League of Nations that the Japanese army's aggression against China has destroyed the League of Nations Covenant. The League of Nations must bear considerable responsibility for the Sino-Japanese dispute. The League of Nations must clearly recognize that the Shanghai incident is a continuation of the Liaoning case. Therefore, we must thoroughly recognize that the motion has a close connection with the Liaoning case. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Nor Has He Obstructed the Passage of the Fourth Army</p>
<p>(Changsha) He Jian recently sent a circular stating that he had read reports in Shanghai newspapers that three Guangdong planes had been detained in Changsha and were not allowed to leave. He also read an editorial in the Shishi Xinbao supported by Japan, which heard that Jiang had secretly ordered Jian to prevent Zhang's troops from aiding Shanghai, which was extremely shocking. Upon investigation, one Guangdong plane had passed through Hunan and stayed in Changsha for two days due to bad weather, and then flew to Beijing and Shanghai to participate in the battle. Since then, no more planes have arrived. As for Zhang's troops, the route through Hunan had been agreed upon long ago, and preparations were made to welcome and send them off warmly. The Hunan provincial army, in addition to a part that was preparing to aid Shanghai and waiting for orders to depart, was engaged in suppressing bandits in northeastern Hunan and had already advanced to western Jiangxi and southern Hubei. How could Zhang's troops be obstructed from passing through Hunan from Guangxi to Shanghai? Zhang's troops should not fail to make it clear in order to highlight their crimes. At this time of great difficulty, I respectfully hope that people across the country will unite sincerely and unite against foreign aggression, and also hope that they will not believe rumors and treat people with suspicion. I am very fortunate and grateful. He Jian Kouchouyin. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>He was known as a Champion of Peace or an International Frenchman, a State Funeral to be Held on Saturday. London - The entire world now recognizes the late Briand as an emissary of peace. This morning, all London newspapers published editorials mourning his passing and detailing his life and achievements. The "Times" states that Briand was a devoted lover of peace, the greatest diplomatic figure of the post-war era, and his passing is a permanent loss. Briand's decline coincides with the resurgence of nationalism in Europe. Since his influence waned, it seems European nations have been treading a thorny path. The "Daily Telegraph" calls Briand an international great and a good Frenchman. The "Daily Mail" says Briand was the person France invariably turned to during difficult and dangerous times. The "Daily Express" and "Daily News Chronicle" both call Briand a champion of peace. The "Daily Sketch" calls him an international Frenchman. (Reuter's dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The King of England sent a telegram to the French President expressing condolences on the death of Briand. The British Ambassador to France also delivered a letter of condolence from the British Prime Minister to the French Premier, stating, "We worked with Briand for decades. Today, I am particularly saddened by his sudden passing. Briand dedicated his life to advancing good understanding among peoples. His name will be remembered longer than any bronze statue. The world will mourn his passing, not just France." During the debate on the naval budget in the British House of Commons, Chamberlain made a eulogy for Briand, saying that no one was more loyal to peace than Briand, and those who die after him should have the courage to follow his example and continue his efforts.

<p>returned to his hometown in Normandy. On February 28th, he returned to Paris, residing on Rue de Clichy. He only received close friends. On Saturday and Sunday, his condition worsened. The next day, he had only a faint breath and eventually passed away. Briand expressed his desire for a simple funeral before his death, but his family has now agreed to a state funeral. His remains will likely be moved to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Reuter's dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Upon receiving news of Briand's death, President Hoover sent a telegram to President Doumergue, stating briefly, "During his life, Briand consistently strived to achieve peace between Europe and America. The American people deeply revered him, and we are deeply saddened by his sudden passing." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Briand passed away at 1:30 PM today. Some time ago, Briand's health was not good, so he went to his villa in Cocherel for rest. Recently, doctors determined that Briand's heart disease was severe and that treatment would be inconvenient in the countryside, forcing Briand to return to Paris and planning to send him to the hospital soon. After returning to his Paris residence, Briand remained bedridden. Doctors strictly prohibited visits from relatives and friends. The window shutters facing the street were closed to allow him to rest quietly. After last Thursday, his condition worsened, but no one expected his sudden passing. This afternoon, the doctor stated that he had given Briand an injection in the morning as usual, and saw him sitting in an armchair in the room, more exhausted than before. At noon, Briand was still on the phone with friends, but an hour later, he suddenly passed away, without showing any pain in his final moments. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) News of Briand's death spread throughout Paris, and all evening newspapers published special editions. When Briand passed, only the doctor and two junior members of his staff were present. At 2:30 PM, over a hundred people gathered at Briand's residence. Across the street, many women were overwhelmed with grief. Subsequently, President Doumergue, Premier Tardieu, Laval, and many members of Parliament, representatives of the diplomatic corps, and former colleagues from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs personally arrived to offer condolences. Briand's residence was simply furnished, filled with books, and the walls were covered with photos, a dazzling array, all capturing highlights from Briand's life and career. Visitors were guided to the main room by Le Vert, the former head of the general affairs department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a former subordinate of Briand. Briand lay on an ordinary bronze bed, dressed in formal attire, without medals, his face and hands pale white, his body thin, but his expression serene, his white hair covering his forehead, his white eyebrows drooping. Viewed under the lamplight, they were even paler than his face. Tardieu was the first to bow to the deceased. At that time, more and more people gathered in front of the door, and many police officers maintained order. Correspondents and film crews filled the premises. Briand had few relatives present, only one or two junior members of his staff. They placed camellias and orchids before the altar. Briand's will stated his wish to be buried in his villa in Cocherel, without excessive extravagance, but at Tardieu's request, his family no longer opposed a state funeral. Cabinet members met at 6:00 PM to prepare for the funeral. Briand's remains will be embalmed to prevent decay, and a temporary memorial will be established in the hall of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on March 10th, allowing the entire nation to pay their respects. The state funeral will be held at 2:00 PM on March 12th. The coffin will first be placed in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at which time Premier Tardieu will deliver a eulogy to the diplomatic corps and members of both houses of Parliament, praising Briand's noble words and deeds during his life. After the eulogy, the coffin will be transported. It is expected that the grand ceremony will be led by soldiers and followed by attendants clearing the way. Briand's coffin will be temporarily placed in the western district of Paris and later transported to Cocherel to rest in peace, according to his wishes during his lifetime. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The news of Briand's death caused great regret in political circles here. Even after his temporary retirement, Briand diligently focused on promoting Franco-German friendship to strengthen European peace. Now, with the loss of this champion of peace, it is feared that this endeavor will inevitably suffer a setback. After receiving the news, German Chancellor Brüning sent a telegram to French Premier Tardieu, expressing his and his colleagues' condolences. In the evening, Briand met with correspondents from the French press stationed in Berlin, reiterating that Germany and the German government shared France's sorrow over the death of this great statesman, and that one of the most important figures in modern history had now departed. France has lost one of its greatest leaders and most diligent politicians, and the world has lost one of its most interesting and inspiring figures. Germany will forever associate Briand's name with the cause of Franco-German friendship. Although its development has been very disappointing to Germany, Briand's efforts to achieve peace between the two countries cannot be denied. He also said that he had the opportunity to interact with Briand last autumn and immediately admired his quick political mind and his sincerity in making decisions. Now, he has suddenly passed away, and he is deeply grieved. (National News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, it was officially announced that Briand's funeral will be held on Saturday at 2:00 PM. Premier Tardieu will deliver the eulogy. Briand's remains are still lying in state in his bed, dressed in a simple evening suit. Former President Doumergue, accompanied by former Premier Laval, visited today to pay respects and kissed Briand's left hand. It has been decided that on Thursday, the remains will be moved to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the state funeral. After the state funeral on Saturday, the remains will be temporarily buried in the Passy Cemetery in Paris, and then reburied in the Cocherel cemetery near Briand's villa. Today, Tardieu stated that he will propose holding a state funeral, with the same protocol as that for Marshal Foch. The French Parliament adjourned immediately after convening at 9:30 PM last night.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Attached: A Brief Biography of Briand <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The late French Premier Briand, whose full name was Aristide Briand, was born in Nantes Province in 1862. After graduating from the University of Saint-Nazaire and the Nantes Academy, he entered the world at the age of twenty. He initially practiced law, but soon switched to journalism, becoming an editor at the Nantes "Western Democracy" newspaper, using the pen name "Nichel." Every article he wrote was widely read. He later went to Paris, where his reputation grew. In 1902, he entered politics, being elected to the National Assembly from the Loire region. He then led the crowd with his eloquence and sharp insight. In 1906, he first served as Minister of Education in the Sarrien cabinet. Shortly after, the cabinet was reorganized, but Briand remained in the same position. In 1908, he became Minister of Justice. The following year, he became Premier and Minister of the Interior. During the railway workers' strike, Briand decisively responded by sending troops to manage the railways, causing a great uproar that eventually subsided. In 1912, Briand's first cabinet was dissolved, but he remained Minister of Justice in the subsequent cabinet. The following year, he formed a new cabinet, but it only lasted two months before collapsing. In 1914, when the European War broke out, Briand was Minister of Justice. In the early stages of the war, he strongly opposed the majority opinion in the National Assembly, firmly advocating resistance. Later, the National Assembly decided to order General Joffre to stop the retreating troops and fight the Germans on the Marne River, all thanks to Briand's efforts. In early 1915, he became Foreign Minister and led his comrades in forming the "Sacred Union," the cabinet vowing to make peace only after victory. The following year, as Foreign Minister, he issued the three-phrase armistice formula of "restoring to the original owner," "compensating for losses," and "providing adequate guarantees" in response to the German peace proposal. In 1917, the cabinet was dissolved, and Briand temporarily withdrew from politics. In 1921, he re-emerged to form a cabinet, still serving as Foreign Minister. During his tenure, there were two major events: the dispatch of troops to occupy the Ruhr industrial area of Germany and his personal attendance at the Washington Conference. The following year, the cabinet collapsed. Subsequently, in April 1925, he was reappointed Foreign Minister, and in November, he became Premier and Foreign Minister until March of the following year. At that time, the resolution of the war debt issue was largely due to Briand's negotiation efforts. However, Briand's greatest contributions to the country and the world were not only made during his time in power, but also during his attendance at the League of Nations. The Locarno Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Young Plan for revising reparations, all prominent in world history, were largely due to Briand's efforts. In 1930, the outline of the European Federal Plan, with its high ambitions and far-reaching vision, was admired by the world. In that year, France withdrew its troops from the Rhineland ahead of schedule, largely due to Briand's efforts. When the Mukden Incident occurred last year, the League of Nations Council held a special meeting in Paris, chaired by Briand. Although the results were not obvious during the meeting, his mediation efforts were numerous. Three months ago, Briand resigned from the heavy post of Foreign Minister due to heart disease, resting at his villa, but he still did not forget politics and was still concerned about peace in the Far East. He planned to return to the political stage soon after recovering from his illness, but unexpectedly, his heart disease suddenly worsened, and he passed away, at the age of only seventy. The news spread around the world, causing shock and grief, and everyone deeply mourned the loss of a champion for world peace. (National News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) A large number of munitions are currently being shipped from Europe to Guangzhou for the purpose of suppressing the Communists in Fujian and Jiangxi. More munitions will be shipped to Guangzhou before the middle of this month. The Air Force recently ordered fifteen aircraft, eight of which are already equipped and ready for use, and the rest will arrive in Guangdong soon. In addition, there are fifty fighter planes donated by Cantonese overseas Chinese residing in the United States. The local aircraft factory is currently operating day and night, organizing engines and aircraft parts. Craftsmen work in two shifts, and wages are paid generously to encourage them. Several aircraft have been built locally, but the engines used come from overseas. Unemployed military officers are now being recruited into the army as mid-level officers or staff officers in the new army. The Military Academy in the north of the city is also recruiting students, with Chen Jitang as the principal. It is currently training 4,000 non-commissioned officers using new tactics. The equipment and funding of this school are more than sufficient compared to the Whampoa Military Academy. Xiong Shihui, Chairman of Jiangxi Province, telegraphed the military authorities here, welcoming the Cantonese troops to enter Jiangxi to suppress the Communists, and said that part of the Jiangxi army is currently used to defend the Yangtze River, so he hopes that the Cantonese army will eliminate the Red scourge as soon as possible. (Reuter's dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Second Central Committee telegraphed the Cantonese Central Committee on the 4th, stating that the Congress has decided to resist Japan in the long term and will never allow an inch of land to fall into Japanese hands without a price. They hope that Guangdong and Guangxi will quickly send troops to Jiangxi to suppress the Communists so that the Jiangxi troops suppressing the Communists can be transferred to resist Japan. The Executive Department replied by telegram on the 6th, stating that in addition to transferring the Fourth Army and the Air Force to support Shanghai, it has also sent the 14th Army Group to aid Jiangxi and Fujian. It hopes that the central government will take overall consideration and make a decision as soon as possible. The safety of the country is at stake, and there should be no hesitation.

<h3 id="e81">The League of Nations' Consular Investigation Team's Fourth Report to the League of Nations <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Shanghai Consular Investigation Team, composed of the Italian Chargé d'Affaires and the Consuls-General of France, Britain, Germany, Spain, and Norway, in cooperation with the US Consul-General, has successively sent three reports to the League of Nations on February 6, February 12, and February 20.</p>
<p>Now, a fourth report has been sent to Geneva on the 4th of this month. The full text is translated as follows:</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese hostilities that began on February 20 continued uninterrupted until March 1. The fighting was very serious on the entire front from Zhabei to Wusong. Many houses were burned down.</p>
<p>On February 23, Japanese aircraft bombed Hongqiao Airport. On the 26th, they also bombed Hangzhou Airport.</p>
<p>On February 29, the Japanese Consul-General informed the Mayor of Shanghai that if China continued to gather reinforcements, Japanese aircraft would inevitably bomb the two railways from Jiaxing to Shanghai and from Suzhou to Shanghai, as well as the military trains on these lines, starting from March 2. The dates were given so that residents could evacuate. The Mayor replied that since the evening of January 28, the Japanese army has been invading Chinese territory and killing Chinese people, continuing to violate international law and treaties and committing cruel and inhumane acts. The Chinese army is only defending against Japanese aggression. All responsibility should be borne by Japan.</p>
<p>On February 28 and 29, the Japanese 11th Division arrived in Chinese waters. A portion of them landed at Wusong, especially near Liuhe on the Yangtze River. Before landing, they shelled the Shizilin Fort and its vicinity. On the 29th and in the days before, several teams landed in the Public Concession, but the Japanese insisted that these troops were to replace the 9th Division and the 24th Mixed Brigade.</p>
<p>On March 1, there were two explosions in the Huangpu River not far from the Japanese Admiral's flagship and another cruiser. The Japanese said that it was caused by China laying underwater mines. Before noon on March 2, Japanese aircraft, in accordance with their notice of February 29, bombed a section of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway near Kunshan.</p>
<p>The Zhabei fire on the afternoon of March 1 caused extremely heavy losses. It is unknown who is responsible. The 11th Division landed at Liuhe, threatening the left flank of the Chinese army, while at the same time the Japanese army launched a large-scale attack in the Jiangwan area. At 4:00 PM on March 1, the Chinese military authorities ordered the Shanghai area</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>to carry out a general retreat, including the troops in Nantao and Longhua. The Japanese army pursued the retreating Chinese troops and occupied the area from Jiading to Nanxiang west of Shanghai by noon on March 3. The Wusong garrison did not retreat first. It was still under attack by the Japanese army until the morning of March 3 and was then occupied.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of March 3, the Japanese Commander-in-Chief declared that the Chinese army had withdrawn beyond the area specified in the Japanese demands of February 18. The threat to Japanese residents and the Public Concession has been removed, so he ordered the Japanese army to temporarily stop at the place reached and stop fighting, on the condition that China takes no hostile action. The Japanese Naval Commander also issued the same declaration. In the evening, the Commander of the Chinese Army declared that he had ordered the troops to cease hostilities if the Japanese did not attack.</p>
<p>The report stated that it should be solemnly declared that all negotiations aimed at achieving a ceasefire have failed as of now. Japan has now stopped advancing, but there is still local fighting in remote areas far from Shanghai at night.</p>
<p>Japanese interference in police and other administrative affairs of the Public Concession, which was stated in the second telegram, has not stopped within the period mentioned above. Protests have been lodged with the Japanese authorities repeatedly. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations' Commission of Inquiry on the Manchurian Incident has been busy with banquets and meetings every day during its week-long stay here and has exchanged views with Japanese authorities and non-political figures in private talks. It has now left here today and is taking the train to Xijing, and then on March 11, it will take the President Adams to Shanghai in Kobe. (Reuter's dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Yan Heling asked US Secretary of State Stimson today to firmly support the League of Nations General Assembly's application for a Shanghai ceasefire resolution. Secretary Stimson issued a statement the other day, declaring that the US State Department is cooperating with the League of Nations on the critical situation between China and Japan in Shanghai, but did not directly mention the League of Nations' resolution. Today, Secretary Stimson again stated that he is considering Dr. Yan's request, but it is still difficult to know whether the US government will issue a firm statement declaring its support for any action by the League of Nations. According to previous statements by the US government, it is paying close attention to developments in Geneva, so the State Department may continue to wait for the results of the League of Nations General Assembly before taking further action.

The investigation is still ongoing. As for Wadu's injuries, according to doctors, his recovery is good, and he is still being treated at the Kremlin Hospital. (National News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(New York) The Lindbergh baby kidnapping case has developed today, attracting the attention of the entire nation, even more than the Sino-Japanese problem. The police intercepted a letter to Lindbergh demanding a ransom of $500,000, a sudden increase of ten times compared to before, and agreed to meet Lindbergh's representative at a restaurant near Mansfield, Pennsylvania. It is rumored that the famous gangster, Spittel, is willing to work with his accomplices to find Lindbergh's young child. After Lindbergh received this letter, he immediately took a train to Mansfield.</p>
<p>Police in Bristol today captured two men and one woman who were rumored to be related to the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. The police began investigating the person who sent the letter when Lindbergh received the $50,000 ransom letter on Saturday and devised a plan to arrest the bandit. (Reuter's dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(Lo-yang) At 9:00 AM on the 7th, the Central Party Headquarters and various government organs held the 4th Expanded Memorial Week in the East Garden of the West Palace. Attending were Central Committee members Zeng Kuoqing, Ding Weifen, Zheng Feihuang, Xiao Zhongzhen, Ye Chucang, Zhou Qigang, Lin Sen, Xiao Jishan, Miao Peicheng, Zhang [blank] Cun, Huang Jichen, Li Jing [blank], Ju Zheng, Qin Zhen, Huang Shaogu, Wang Zhaoming, Chu Minyi, Bai Yunti, Ma Fuxiang, Chen Guofu, Zhang Ji, and staff from various organs. Committee member Ye Chucang presided and led the ceremony. Committee member Zhang then gave a report, stating that this was the first memorial week after the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. The results of the Second Plenary Session and its spirit of sincere unity are already known to all and need not be elaborated upon. We must never forget the aggression of the brutal Japanese. During this time, we should be calm and avoid being restless. If we are easily delighted or angered, we will easily be taken advantage of by the enemy. Two or three hundred years ago, foreign tribes also invaded. At that time, everything was dictated by power, and there was no justice to speak of. In the 20th century, international justice is clearly guaranteed and cannot rely solely on power. The Japanese aggression only exposes their barbarity, and the whole world will definitely not sympathize with them. As for our country, as long as we have a strict organization and plan, we will never be subjugated. Therefore, our civilian and military comrades should immediately eliminate the previous disagreements and the evils of territorial division, unite as one, follow the late Premier's instructions, and strive to implement the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session. Then the national foundation can be stabilized, and the national crisis can be overcome. The Central Political Council has elected Comrade Jiang Zhongzheng as the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. Our armed comrades have someone to lead them. In terms of administration, Comrade Wang Jingwei has already determined the policy direction and it has been approved by the Second Plenary Session. From now on, we should respect the wishes of these two comrades, assist in their work, and not be concerned about personal fame and fortune, but prioritize the nation and the people. The future of China is not hopeless. Belgium was ravaged by the Germans, and even the government moved to France, yet it still exists. Our country has a vast territory and a large population. Unless we destroy ourselves, no one can destroy China. From now on, we hope that we will all be inspired and the Chinese nation will surely exist forever, and the Republic of China will surely achieve lasting glory. (8th dispatch)</p>

Among them, a ticket inspector from the Shanghai Railway Bureau and a driver from the Hutchison Whampoa, etc., were released on bail after the bureau provided a guarantee. (8th dispatch)</p>

<p>Songjiang correspondence: Yesterday (the 6th) at around 5 PM, nine large boats passed through the river inside the West Outer Drawbridge, fully loaded with boxes, cages, objects, tables, chairs, etc., and there were also nine coffins. The people on board were all from north of the Yangtze River, which aroused suspicion among the public, who reported it to the Public Security Bureau. Inspector Ling was dispatched to investigate. They claimed to be from Hukiaochiao in Hongkou, Shanghai, and were planning to return to Funing, etc. The number of onlookers from the public continued to increase. Inspector Ling, considering the current tense situation, had to request instructions on how to handle the situation and ordered the boats to be temporarily detained in Caihua Jing, with police guarding them. The authorities were quite suspicious of the coffins on board, but due to the late hour, they were unable to open the coffins for inspection. This morning (the 7th), the coffins were opened and all contained corpses. They were immediately escorted out of the area, and the people's hearts were somewhat settled.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Japanese Financial Situation <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Japan's Insufficient Annual Income. The Tokyo Times reports that due to the expansion of the war in Shanghai, all aspects of our country's financial world have been agitated, and the financial sector has been particularly affected. The government wants to raise debt to cope with the situation, but Minister of Finance Takahashi strongly opposes the idea of publicly issuing military bonds. He solemnly declared at the National Debt Exchange Association some time ago, but the planned amount of 97.9 million yuan has been issued, and if it is all to be borne by the Deposit Bureau, then there will be no more capacity to bear it in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to raise funds from the market. Unexpectedly, the war in Shanghai has now added 23 million yuan, which will inevitably lead to currency inflation. If this public debt is raised from the market, it will not be able to recover market funds in a short time, but will instead stimulate a surge in prices. Moreover, the current society and the public have no ability to bear it. According to the Ministry of Finance's investigation of the settlement at the end of December in the sixth year of Showa, the revenue and expenditure for the sixth year are currently estimated to be 819.08 million yen and 679.4 million yen, respectively, with a revenue shortfall of 140.403 million yen, a decrease of 109 million yen compared to last year's revenue, and an increase of more than 8.9 million yen in expenditure. Various tax revenues have all plummeted, and the Ministry of Finance's issuance of securities and the limit on borrowing have been internally determined to expand to 350 million yen (currently 250 million yen). Because the parliament was dissolved, the budget for the seventh year is still based on the sixth year and has not yet been formally established. In terms of internal affairs alone, the budget for the seventh year is about 180 million yen, an increase of 80 million yen. Today, the national treasury is already insufficient, and since the Shanghai Incident, many countries in the alliance have tended to be radical. The yen-dollar exchange rate has suddenly plummeted, various stocks have crashed, and bank exchange rates have also changed greatly. Markets across the country are sluggish, and the financial sector cannot avoid being affected.</p>
<p>Japan's Foreign Debt Exceeds 300 Million. The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reports that due to sluggish trade, the international balance of payments and the amount of repayment of other foreign public debts, from March of this year to February of next year, the total principal and interest to be repaid is 300.345 million yen. The monthly calculations are as follows: March, £758,000, 1,955,000 francs, 1,719,000 yuan; April, 539,000 yen, £124,000; May, 8,734,000 francs, £52,000, 2,814,000 yuan; June, £728,000, 2,881,000 yuan; July, £7,570,000, 13,354,000 yuan; August, £20,000, 5,256,000 yuan; September, 1,955,000 francs, £728,000, 1,719,000 yuan; October, 719 yuan; November, 8,734,000 francs, £52,000, 2,814,000 yuan; December, £3,131,000, 728,000 yuan; January of next year, £1,380,000, 1,561,000 yuan; February, £92,000, 6,376,000 yuan; for a total of one year, 11,378,000 francs, 42,883,000 yuan, £12,232,000, totaling 303,045,000 yen.</p>
<p>Japan's Trade Deficit Again. The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun publishes the Ministry of Finance's announcement of the foreign trade volume of sixteen ports in late February as follows: exports were 25,676,000 yen, and imports were 41,832,000 yen, with a trade deficit of 16,156,000 yen. From January to the end of February this year, the total trade deficit in two months reached 91,401,000 yen, breaking all previous records.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Japanese Reception of the League of Nations Investigation Team <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The League of Nations investigation team has now arrived in Japan and is about to begin investigating the dispute between China and Japan. The investigation team was originally named the "Manchurian Incident Investigation Team." When the League of Nations decided to send the investigation team, the Japanese army had not yet invaded Shanghai, so the name "Manchurian Incident" was used. Now, the incident in Shanghai has expanded, and the largest commercial port in the Far East, jointly operated by countries around the world and China, is in danger. The foreign merchants in Shanghai have witnessed and heard more and more since January 28th, and have felt the pain deeply. The scope of the investigation team's investigation will naturally not be limited to the Manchurian Incident. The investigation team has a total of five members: British Dr. Lytton, French General Gamel, American General MacLowey, German Dr. Schnee, and Italian Mr. Marquis Scotese, all of whom are world-renowned figures. The governments of the relevant countries were extremely cautious in selecting them, because the matter is of great importance, and people all over the world are looking forward to a fair report from the investigation. According to a merchant who received news from Tokyo, the Japanese government's reception of the investigation team was extremely grand. A reception committee was specially organized, with Ambassador Yoshida as the chairman and Minister Arita and other important figures in the diplomatic community, both in and out of office, as members. People from all walks of life who are proficient in English, French, German, and Italian were also recruited as receptionists. The investigation team arrived in Yokohama at 6:00 AM on February 29th aboard the American ship President Coolidge. The entire reception committee was waiting at the port. Newspapers from all over Japan sent two or three reporters to accompany them. The local police also organized a very orderly welcoming group from all walks of life in advance. The investigation team immediately transferred to a special train and went directly to Tokyo, arriving at Tokyo Station at 9:15 AM. All the staff at the Tokyo and Yokohama stations and on the special train were very neat and were temporarily transferred. The receptionists on the special train were also temporarily hired and were all young students above high school level who were proficient in various foreign languages, which shows the thoughtfulness of the arrangements. It is also said that all the government receptionists welcomed them in Yokohama and accompanied them to Tokyo, following them closely all day long. On the special train, they distributed pre-printed documents about the events in the three northeastern provinces and Shanghai to the investigation team. The documents were in five languages: English, Japanese, French, German, and Italian. On the same day, all the newspapers in Tokyo published large-character welcomes to the investigation team on the first page. There were also people giving speeches in various bustling areas of Tokyo to express public opinion. People's organizations printed a large number of various English and French pamphlets and leaflets. All the arrangements were handled by different groups of the reception committee and had been completed two weeks in advance. It is also said that the investigation team met with Prime Minister Inukai at 3:00 PM on the 29th. Japanese government and private organizations are preparing banquets, and the schedule is as follows: March 1st, Prime Minister Inukai's luncheon; 2nd, Press Association luncheon, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa's dinner; 3rd, Emperor's luncheon, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa's wife's tea party at 5:00 PM, League of Nations Association dinner; 4th, German and French Ambassadors' luncheon, industrial groups' theater visit and dinner in the afternoon; 5th, Minister of the Navy's luncheon, Pacific Affairs Research Council tea party in the afternoon, Baron Okura and the Italian Ambassador's dinner; 6th, tour to Hakone Nikko Honkan for dinner; 7th, Minister of the Army's luncheon, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs' dinner; 8th, departure from Tokyo; 9th, tour to Kyoto; 10th, tour to Daye; 11th, departure from Kobe to Dalian aboard the President Adams. The Japanese people's external propaganda and communication can be said to be meticulous.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Jiangsu Provincial Government Collects Rent <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that with the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the security of the province's rear is extremely important. Military and police forces are urgently needed, and it is necessary to plan for funds in advance. After a committee meeting, it was decided to collect two months' rent from the counties, following the method of rent collection in 1928, to meet urgent needs. Fifteen articles of the constitution were also agreed upon, and the county governments and public security bureaus were responsible for implementation, with a deadline of the end of April to collect all the funds and complete the process. If Zhenjiang follows the number of collections in 1928, 80,000 yuan can be obtained in two months. The constitution is as follows: 1. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to maintain local security in the event of war and prepare for urgent military and police needs, has specifically formulated this constitution for the collection of rent from the counties. 2. The collection of rent is limited to two months and will not be continued. 3. All houses owned by people within the province, whether shops or residences, are subject to collection. 4. The area for rent collection is limited to county towns and prosperous towns. Rural houses without towns are exempt from collection. 5. All party and government organs, military and police schools, local public welfare organizations, nunneries, temples, ancestral halls, etc., are exempt from collection. 6. All monthly rents of less than two yuan are exempt from collection. 7. For rented houses, the lease should be inspected, and the rent should be paid by the tenant on behalf of the landlord in two months, according to the rent price. The tenant should obtain a receipt to give to the landlord as a deduction (vacant houses are not collected). 8. If the tenant colludes with the landlord to hide the true amount or report less rent, they will be fined one time the rent due, with the tenant and landlord each bearing half of the fine. 9. For self-owned houses, the rent should be estimated and an appropriate rent should be determined for collection, based on the size and comparison with neighboring houses. 10. Rent collection uses three-part forms, which are issued and published in the style prescribed by the Department. 11. Rent collection is supervised by the county government and the public security bureau, and the urban and rural public security sub-bureaus are responsible for the actual collection. 12. The public security bureau's handling fee for rent collection can be deducted from the rent income at a rate of 5%. The county's printing costs for receipts can be deducted at a rate of 3%. 13. The rent collection funds should be sent by the public security bureau to the county government on a monthly basis, together with the payment, and reported to the Department of Finance. In counties with financial bureaus, the funds should be transferred to the financial bureau for reporting. 14. Special funds are designated for special purposes and county governments are not allowed to retain them. 15. This constitution shall be promulgated and implemented by the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>
