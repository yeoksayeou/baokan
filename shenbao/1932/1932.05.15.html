<p>時評</p>
<h3>研究蘇聨彬</h3>
<p>對於國際問題之忽視。是國人一般的通病。數年前對於近鄰的日本。因爲戴季陶先生出版了一本日本論。繼復有人組織研究日本問題的團體。一般人才注意日本問題。對於蘇聨的一切。因爲防遏共産黨反對馬克思主義之故。一向是禁止研究。禁止討論。一般人併摒棄蘇聨一切而亦不願談。這正如戴季陶先生所説恰爲一種（智識上的義和團。）　　近年來南京曾有俄羅斯研究與蘇聨評論出版。最近又聞有人將組織蘇聨研究會。蘇聨問題。漸爲國人所注意。這是學術界的一種好現象。實在姑無論共産黨怎樣。馬克思主義怎樣。即使我們欲反對蘇聨。亦應該對於他們國内的一切。細加研究。找出一個反對的理由來。　　在目前整個世界都陷於經於經濟凋敝的過程中。深刻而擴大的不景氣。使每一個政治家。每一個金融家或企業家。都苦臉愁眉。獨有蘇聨似乎處在另一個世界。站在不景氣的圈外。朝着繁榮的前途突飛猛進。假如我們認爲道是一個（奇蹟）。這（奇蹟）也就值得我們一加研究了。我們能夠説（這不干我們的事）嗎。　　進一步説。無論如何。我們總不能不承認蘇聨是一種新的創作和試騐。這種創作和試騐根本對於過去的所謂道德。宗教。自由。正義。家庭。文伦。制度。以及一切人與人的關係。都予以重新的估價。無論其爲好或是壞。但在今後的年代中。必和任何一個國家都發生更深切的影響。末那。我們對於這種創作。這種試騐的研究和了解。是可以少的嗎。而且。一個佔全地球六分之一的國家的人民。他們整天埋着頭吃苦。究竟是在做些什麽。我們又不應該明白知道嗎。　　在過去。關於蘇聨。我們所聽到的傳聞。不是如像童話或神話中所記載的故事一樣的離奇荒謬。便是有意的傷。或誣衊。然而蘇聨畢竟只是一個國家。支持這個國家的。也只是一些如像我們一樣的人。不是洪水。也不是猛獸。咒咀與誣衊。事實上非但不足以使蘇聨自然消滅。且足以證明咒咀者之恐怖與驚惶。所以我們認爲現在我們對於蘇聨的研究。先應抱定三種態度。第一是應剷除對蘇聨恐怖的觀念。第二是應絶對的立於客觀的地位。平心靜氣。不帶感情。不存成見。第三是應研究其政體制度政策等一切的得或失。作自己的借鏡。　　蘇聨的産生。不是偶然的。它是有着悠遠的歷史背景。蘇聨目前的繁榮。也並不是奇蹟。而只是他們領袖和人民一致刻苦。犧牲。堅忍。奮鬥所穫得的果實。世界已動盪在轉換的過程裏。而他們却正在做一種歷史上最勇敢的試騐。徹斯曾説。（現代的蘇聨人。無需别的動機。只要這種創造新天新地的熱忱。已足使每個良善的共産黨員的胸中燃燒起來了。）我們且一研究這勇敢的試騐的内幕罷。我們且一檢查這種新天地創造的工程罷。</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>外論社譯十三日法文日報云、日政府突然决定將駐滬日軍即刻撤回日本、使本埠及各地人士咸感驚愕、在和平會議期間、日代表經數星期之堅持、反對規定撤退日期、日政府亦屢次表示對於此點不能讓步、當十九國委員會宣稱、上海共同委員會有權以多數承認常態之恢復時、東京政府即不承認十九國委員會、我人因此以爲日本此種態度、乃有長期佔據上海區域之意、吾人因揣測其必有黑幕、有謂將在上海開闢日租界、有謂其將待至公共租界推廣至吳淞、然後方肯撤兵、但於協定簽字之翌日、日本陸相即將其軍隊全部調回、並放棄其代表在和會中苦爭所得之（暫駐地點）、乃與自稱探悉内情者所云、毫不相符、惟日本如此突然决定、其所宣布之理由、似亦無關重要、前者日代表宣稱、日軍决於最早期間澈退、吾人以爲其用意在使外間輿論熄滅耳、但必有其他重要原由、使犬養内閣提早撤兵之期、華文報紙及不少外人、以爲撤退上海駐軍、乃將運往滿洲、因彼方情形、確於最近數星期内日趨嚴重也、所言固不無相當理由、但亦不能認爲確切之論、蓋如日人在滬確有所圖、彼不妨遺留一二師團於此、而並不妨其在滿洲之行動、因日本軍隊之人數與物質俱不感缺乏也、實在原因、日軍之撤退乃因列强至今不予以答覆、（譯者按指自由市提案）及列强中有若干國、急速從事於攫取因日軍侵略而産生之種種利益、對於日本則反忘恩負義報以惡聲、東京政府以不耐久待列强有條件合作之實現、覺其不應再延長其使華人仇視及引起漁翁得利之某數强國咎責之措施、彼已不願爲人作嫁焉、日人當已想及外人將乘日軍侵滬之機修改本埠之約章、但欲達此目的、必需列强出其力量、不幸列强竟違反其僑民在租界納税人會所表示之意志、並未思及利用機會實現費唐法官主張之全部或一部份、在歐洲或在上海之官方聲明、竟俱屬不利於日本者、全體一致詬斥日軍之侵滬、在此期間、有若干洋商出口公司、稍貶其價、以吸引一般本爲日人主雇之華商、揚子航業、日商船已絶跡、而其競爭者乃得獨霸航業、日本政府、因或思及彼不應再延長此項不智之計謀、尤甚者、竟無人能認識其希圖擴張租界而所盡之力量或願盡之力量、而爲其知音者、因此彼决然及早撤其軍隊而讓人單獨自理也、自今日起、吾人似應靜待目前雖因種種糾紛而分離之遠東二大國、或能於不甚久遠之時將復見親善云、</p>

<h3>説愛爾蘭自由邦（下）</h3>
<p>— 開煦</p>
<p>旣而佛黨中選得美麗天成之少女二人。彼等均大學畢業。足智多謀之女子。於是即以此二女子。扮作田家女。作爲假農民之戚串。使同居於田舍中。暇則田間散步。故與獄卒近。日久益稔。亦時與携手同游。竟忘其職守。佛勒拉出獄之日。旣定時爲一九一九年之二月三日下午。依獄規季人應於是日羣入獄後院。作三小時之體操。體操時間自下午四時始至七時止。約五時許二少女來獄附近。獄卒等歡然迎之。於是羣相笑謔。或則故爲風情撩撥。情話綿綿。此數獄卒竟爲美色所迷。各挾其所歡徜徉於田間。無意之間。已距獄甚遠。其餘數農夫如於此千金一刻之時光中。割斷鐵絲網。復以假鑰啟獄之後户。導佛氏出。預伏之汽車凡六。以一載佛氏疾駛去。其五則在後故作疑陣。使不獲佛車。此佛氏越獄之浪漫事蹟也。佛氏自獄先徴服至倫敦。復扮作苦力。西渡至美。翌年英政府劃愛爾蘭二十六府地建設愛爾蘭自由邦。一九二一年英愛間訂立自由邦條約。佛氏先曾言自由邦條約告成。愛爾蘭必有流血發生。故一九二二年之六月。愛爾蘭義勇軍興師討伐自由邦軍隊。蓋亦如我東北義勇軍之勃興。與傀儡政府軍隊抗也。（然愛爾蘭自由邦之軍隊豈如滿洲僞國軍隊之受日人之嗾使而自吠其主乎）戰役一生。（都柏林）名區半爲灰燼。是後一年之中。暴亂相循。死亡如麻。暗殺者相望於途。凡自由邦首領之死者。不可更僕數。佛氏時已深匿山谷中。凡發號施令。皆經數十人轉輾而出。即其部屬亦莫能知佛氏之所在。故自由邦當局有無可弋獲之歎。至一九二三年之一月。自由邦獄中之黨已逾萬人。佛氏以禍亂連結。徒苦人民。於是召其部屬。訓以放棄奮鬥。此十年内和平之所自也。然今日佛氏復出。豈遂能如我國之以民治爲標榜者。一旦入主中樞。如南面王之侈然自得耶。</p>

<h3>玄武湖初夏散記</h3>
<p>— 眞相</p>
<p>櫻桃紅熟。黄鶯婉囀。此玄武湖濱。士女雲集之時也。玄武湖年來因京市府之慘淡經營。利用天然形勢。加意整頓佈置。湖濱馬路放寛。已倍疇昔。而五洲公園沐歐風美雨。綠草成茵。綵花如帶。背山臨湖。風景尤覺怡人。是以秦淮莫愁之遊客。而今咸爲玄武湖所吸引。固不僅爲櫻桃之吸力也。　　櫻桃市價不獨早晚不同。而且亦因人而異。往往西裝革履偕有女伴者。欲購櫻桃。必較他人爲略貴。通常吾人在初上市時。出洋三角可得一斤。而貴時則一元尚不得三斤。同時。船價之變化。亦似隨櫻桃爲轉移櫻桃售最高價時。舟子索價亦甚昻。反之。櫻桃價廉時。舟子亦即不奇貨可居矣。平時繞湖一大週。一舟載五六人。其代價不過四角。貴時。則雖出一番。亦不得一小舟焉。　　城北人遊湖者。昔多由臺城上逕往。安步當車。亦頗方便。今則因時局關係。臺城斷絶交通。遊人須繞道前往。莫不苦之。聞當局方面。不日即須拆除障碍物。以便遊人。但尚不知果否能成爲事實也。　　日前蔡廷楷將軍來京。特輕車減從作湖上遊。一小學生遥見之曰。此非蔡廷楷將軍乎。將軍含笑視之。於是遊人聞將軍至。莫不以爭睹抗日大將之英顔以爲快。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>政府標榜着（長期抵抗），事實上恰是（從來不抵抗），於是政府喪權失地的罪過，國人始終不能諒解。我們以俄國爲例，就可證明武力抵抗，是多麽大的權威！俄國在東省事變以後，便在海參崴···等處，趕築要塞，佈置海陸空軍陣地，儼然有（山雨欲來）之勢，憑你日本怎樣兇暴，也不敢越雷池一步；反而隨處表示讓步，欲求其諒解，即美國也主張美俄有復交的必要。俄國準備（抵抗），而日本軟化；中國步步退讓，而日本反得隴望蜀。當局誤解了（禮讓爲國），一再鑄成大錯，貽萬世之羞！現在榆關吃緊，只有義勇軍去拚命，政府是不是（抵抗），誰都不知道，但現政府究竟是（救國），或是（賣國），却就看這次最後的試騐。</p>
<h3>從那兒説起</h3>
<p>— 孫榖梁</p>
<p>蔣明極因組織什麽東南自衛軍，已經軍政部組織特别法庭審判，結果宣布死刑，執行槍决了。（見昨日本報路透電）這種企圖逞火打刦，謀爲不軌的危險份子，明正極刑，咱們當然是没有話説，願聞之至的。但是曾經甚囂塵上，實行新獻地圖的王賡，因（案情重大）而被逮解京之後，似乎長久得要被一般人所遺忘了！當時也曾聽到要組織什麽法庭來審判，可是審到現在，還不見判出什麽來。據神經過敏的朋友説，（此王有恃無恐，逮解入京，實際反多一重保障，這條命兒，一定可以賡續下去，不會出什麽亂子的！）這話究竟怎樣，咱們自然不得而知，但直覺上感到世事確有幸有不幸。仔細忖忖，却發生一種莫名其妙的感觸，覺得這年頭兒，眞從那兒説起！</p>
<h3>木中取糖</h3>
<p>— 嘉宣</p>
<p>誰都知道我們現在吃的糖，都是由甘蔗或蘿蔔製成的，從來却没有聽見過木頭裏面也可以取出糖來。但是我們用不着驚奇，幾百年前我們祖宗視爲不可能的種種事情，現在我們不是司空見慣了嗎？木中取糖，在最近的將來，或者要成爲很平常的事情：因爲這在試騐室中現在已告成功，而且成本低廉，所以這種製糖的方法，定有商業化的可能！　　木中取糖，係利用一種化學作用，｜化學上所謂（加水分解）｜而成功的。因爲我們現在已知道木中纖維素，假若受到酸的影響，牠就能和水化合而成糖及其他物質。這種取糖的方法，亦很簡單：用一個圓桶，滿盛極細的木屑，再拿這木屑，用蒸汽蒸一小時左右；同時，將稀硫酸的溶液（濃度爲千分之一至千分之二，就是在一千分的稀硫酸中，祗有一分或二分是純硫酸，其餘都是清水。）加熱到華氏八十度至九十度的光景，然後將這熱溶液通入木屑桶的下底而入桶内，再由桶的上口流出，在這樣流出的液體中，約含有百分之二·五至百分之三的糖。這含糖質的液體，在未到貯藏缸以前，還要經過一個盛骨灰的圓桶，自的在使這液體内的加水分解作用，得以完全運用。　　用這樣的方法製糖，每百分的木屑中，可得三十分至四十分的糖。在製造的過程中，硫酸的消耗量，大槪佔所得糖量的百分之六。</p>
<h3>哭訴</h3>
<p>— 蓓舊</p>
<p>身經轟炸之險，目擊彈火之慘，家·欲歸不得，人。流離顚沛，孤零零地流落在春申江畔，望長空而哭訴：　　蒼天啊！我没罪吧？我自信待人以厚。我自信持事以恭，對國家，聊表寸心，對社會，貢獻微忱；然而美滿的家庭，啓了殘痕，快樂的環境，滿跟狰獰；錦繡河山，留得灰爐狼烟，故鄉風土，</p>
<h3>國難中的父母</h3>
<p>— 陳汝敏</p>
<p>兒童，這原是可人的名詞。要是世界上失去了兒童，那這世界是充滿了枯燥而没半點生氣，家庭中少了兒童，像幸福之源泉乾涸了！我們相信愛倫凱女士的話：（二十世紀是兒童世紀。）但是兒童的世界中，需要兒童化的父母去教育他！眞像一個園丁去灌溉一朶含苞未放的紅玫瑰一樣，飽滿的芬芳和醉人的色澤是需要有力的帮助，才會展放她的香和色。　　過去中國底兒童，被父母鄙棄了，他們做了富家的私産，窮人的奴隸，天性，自由，幸福，全給父母阻遏而湮没了！這眞是浩大的損失，影響了我們整個的中國。唉！　　現在該是臨崖勒馬的時期了，國難已到，敵兵尚在國境裏開砲，在這艱難的環境中，做父母的，該如何負起救國的責任，去訓導自己的孩子，走上救國之路呢？　　來！這裏有三個具體的方法告訴你們：　　（一）佈置抗日的家庭環境｜｜我們要給兒童一個深刻的印象，對於自己的敵人。　　（二）講述革命偉人的故事｜｜呌兒童的思想革命化，造成他見義勇爲的習慣。　　（三）參觀敵人踐踏的戰地｜｜領你的兒閘北女到吳淞去看看敵人的殘暴痕跡，他會激起有力的反饗。　　中國的兒童，是世界上責任最重大的兒童，我們且莫輕看了他，我們要竪起兒童救國的旗幟，打開前面的障礙物，我們要舉起火把，照耀着前程，讓孩子們走上救國之路。　　摧殘了刀劍森森，有家歸不得！憶春風兮彷徨，蒼天啊！請指示我迷途，請歷數我罪過。　　蒼天啊！你何太不仁？傖夫誤國，盜賊横行，尸位素餐之輩，朝座盈盈，小民之疾苦兮不顧，暴宼攻門兮無聞！哀哀小民，競競業業，到如今黄泉路英魂接踵，森羅殿有寃莫伸，蒼天啊！你何太不仁？　　蒼天啊！你也聽見過長期抵抗，你也看見過抵抗精神，可是和議協定，簽字告成，十四萬萬之代價安在？英雄熱血之價值何存？嗚呼！死作含寃之鬼，生爲踐踏之民，滿腔悲憤，片片赤心，可向誰去伸訴？更誰鑒其眞忱？蒼天啊！只你可聽我撫琴哭訴，無病呻吟。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（五二）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第七回干謁到豪門常使將軍顚倒幽覊在情獄卒能夫婿牢籠　　這兩個馬弁正待上前動問。忽地門房中另有一個人也因聽得大門外汽車喇叭呌。掀開窗帘子隔窗張望了一眼。就一頭鑽出來迎着那女客笑嘻嘻的呌道。八小姐。您來的電話早接着了。五太太正在候着您呢。請罷。上五太太房裏去坐罷。那女客妙目一瞟。見這個向伊打招呼的人。眉清目秀。瘦小身材。穿一套剪裁得極合式的新黄呢軍服。繫着武裝帶。佩着一支不帶木盒子而裝在皮套上的自來得小手槍。登著一雙附有馬剌輪在脚後跟的黄色長統皮靴。兩肩上又掛着個上尉階級的小肩牌。直像個最漂亮的少年軍官模樣。乍一相見。竟幾乎不認得。及細看出來是誰。才含笑點頭説道。喝：德順。你現在眞得法啦。那名呌德順的臉上微微一紅。腆然回答道。好説。您啦。這還不是五太太特别栽培我的嗎。於是一問一答有説有笑的逕領導着那女客一路向裏走去、那兩個馬弁聽得明白。相對着又各扮了一個鬼臉道。原來是找五太太的。難怪那小子會混到門上來專心等候。不關咱們的事呢。説罷。門外又來了客人。他們揀一些不認得的。指引到二門邊的承啟處。又有些常來的熟人。不營指引也自會向承啟處去投到。再由承啟處酌量分别班次的先後。一個或幾個一班。由一員少校階級的承啟官。拈着各人的名刺。帶到會客聽去參見葉督軍。那葉督軍每天特訂出這個時間會客。求見的總常有百人上下。每一班叙談那麽幾分鐘。從下午四點會到六點。時間還是不够。總不能把這些人一個個都見完。或是鐘點到了。或是半腰裏臨時另有要公及偶爾感着厭煩與疲倦。那就宣告截止。明天再見。若明天仍没輪着。好在還有後天。及後天還是那樣。你們就不妨天天都來候他一輩子。好像是全憑各人的運氣。與承啟處將一大束名片分配班次時那一時的手法。</p>

<h3>電鍍</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>電鍍在工業上應用甚廣，平常簡單實騐，亦有趣而易行，凡鑰匙或其他金屬小件，欲防其生銹或欲使其較爲美觀者，皆得鍍上他種金屬一層，此外如圖章草木或錢幣之花紋皆可仿製，而與原物畢肖，　　原理凡一種金屬之鹽類之溶液，（電液）經過直流電，則起分化，金屬之純質則附於負極，與鹽化合之養氣及酸類則附於正極，　　甲金屬物上鍍他種金屬用具一，五至四伏脱電池一個或數個瓷質器一個（用平常飯盌或玻璃杯亦可）電液凡金屬鹽之溶液都可，茲舉數例；一、鍍銅，可用硫酸銅溶於適量之水中，二、鍍銀，炭酸銀一份，𩇛化鉀十份清水百份，三、鍍鎳，硝酸鎳五份重亞硫酸鈉五份清水百份，　　裝置將電液承入瓷器中，將欲鍍之物浸入懸空，接至電池負極、正極則懸一與電化液相同之金屬片（如鍍少量之銀得以炭精片代銀片）經數小時後電鍍即成，可取出洗凈擦亮之，　　注意凡物在電鍍之前，必需先用細砂皮將銹污等去淨，入輕養化鈉中洗之，然後再以稀鹽酸擦過，否則恐不能經久而易脱落，　　乙翻製花紋　　譬如有一徽章，或古錢，今欲仿製其表面花紋，可先將蠟，粘土，或石膏·壓在上項物件上，而得一陰紋模型，再以乾毛筆醮筆鉛粉輕輕塗之，使模面成導電體，即可如上述電鍍，俟有相當厚度，取出使與模分離即得，其他如布，草木之葉，甲蟲皆可電鍍，殊爲有趣，惟以篇幅關係，不及細述，主於工業上如鋁·純鐵·電氣業中之銅，及其他極純粹之金屬，皆可用電化法得之，故電氣化學，殊有提倡之價值，</p>

<h3>悞會得好笑</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>一國的言語，不能統一，眞是莫大的不便，即如我國一省有一省的言語，一縣一鎭有一縣一鎭的土白，我國言語如此複雜，可稱世界之冠，往往共處一堂，同是一國裏的人，因爲彼此言語不通，（如廣東人之與浙江人福建人之與江蘇人···）就非得請翻譯不可，否則，就得閙笑話，　　我家新近換了一個娘姨，是安徽蕪湖人，她呌（鉛壺）呌（串子），一天，正下着雨，她向我的母親説，要去拿那修好的（串子），於是母親一時悞，以爲她因爲下雨，要坐車子去拿（鉛壺），就向她説，（下雨你好撑傘，何必化錢坐車子），後來纏了許久，方始明白，她是要去拿（鉛壺），細想起來，令人忍俊不住，　　因此我聨想起，前天三母舅講的一章笑話，他説，（南方有一種菜，名呌（馬籃頭），而北方則呌（牲口筐子腦袋），因爲北方人呌（馬）是（牲口），呌（籃）是（筐子），呌（頭）是（腦袋），一天，老爺呌僕人去買（馬籃頭）而説（牲口筐子腦袋），這個僕人是南方人，他聽了這個名詞，雖莫明其妙，但是不敢多問，他於是走遍了北京城，（現呌北平）竟不知什麽地方買這（牲口筐子腦袋），後來向旁人多方探問，方纔知道就是（馬籃頭），這個不解言語的笑話，也夠令人捧腹，　　同時我又聨想起，一天在某處，見一位廣東人，要與一位浙江人通話，無奈彼此言語不同，然而彼此却能説英語，他們不得已，祇好拿英語權代國英語於是彼此就大講其英語，我常見國人相遇，以説外國語爲時髦，每爲之痛心，像本文所講的這兩位仁兄之大説其英語，自當别論，因爲他們彼此言語不同，如果不説英語，那祇好如金人之緘默，不然也難免要閙笑話，於此可見謀國語之統一，實在也是一樁要緊的事情，</p>

<h3>Researching the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Neglecting international issues is a common problem among our countrymen. Years ago, people only started paying attention to Japan, a close neighbor, after Mr. Dai Jitao published his book "On Japan" and groups were formed to study the Japanese issue. Regarding all things Soviet, due to preventing and suppressing the Communist Party and opposing Marxism, research and discussion have always been prohibited. The general public rejects and avoids talking about anything Soviet. This, as Mr. Dai Jitao said, is exactly a kind of "Boxer Rebellion in intellect." In recent years, Nanjing has published "Russian Studies" and "Soviet Union Commentary." Recently, it was also heard that someone will organize a Soviet Union Research Association. The Soviet Union issue is gradually attracting the attention of the Chinese people. This is a good phenomenon in academic circles. In fact, regardless of what the Communist Party is like or what Marxism is like, even if we want to oppose the Soviet Union, we should carefully study everything within their country and find a reason to oppose them. Currently, the entire world is trapped in a process of economic decline, with a deep and widespread depression. Every politician, financier, or entrepreneur wears a bitter and worried face. Only the Soviet Union seems to be in another world, standing outside the circle of depression and advancing rapidly towards a prosperous future. If we consider this a "miracle," then this "miracle" is worth our research. Can we say, "This is none of our business?" Furthermore, regardless, we must admit that the Soviet Union is a new creation and experiment. This creation and experiment fundamentally re-evaluates the so-called morality, religion, freedom, justice, family, ethics, systems, and all human relationships of the past. Whether it is good or bad, in the years to come, it will inevitably have a deeper impact on every country. Then, can our research and understanding of this creation and this experiment be less? Moreover, what exactly are the people of a country that occupies one-sixth of the earth doing all day long with their heads buried in hard work? Shouldn't we know this clearly? In the past, what we have heard about the Soviet Union has been as bizarre and absurd as the stories recorded in fairy tales or myths, or intentionally slanderous or fabricated. However, the Soviet Union is, after all, just a country. What supports this country are just some people like us, not floods or fierce beasts. Curses and slander, in fact, are not only insufficient to make the Soviet Union disappear naturally, but also sufficient to prove the terror and panic of the cursers. Therefore, we believe that our research on the Soviet Union should first be based on three attitudes. First, we should eradicate the concept of being terrified of the Soviet Union. Second, we should absolutely stand in an objective position, calmly and peacefully, without emotions and without preconceptions. Third, we should study the gains and losses of its political system, institutions, policies, and everything else as a mirror for ourselves. The emergence of the Soviet Union was not accidental. It has a long historical background. The current prosperity of the Soviet Union is not a miracle, but simply the result of the consistent hard work, sacrifice, perseverance, and struggle of its leaders and people. The world is already in a turbulent process of transformation, and they are doing one of the most courageous experiments in history. Chase said, "Modern Soviet people need no other motivation. Just this enthusiasm for creating a new heaven and earth is enough to ignite the hearts of every good communist." Let us study the inside story of this courageous experiment. Let us examine the project of creating this new world.</p>

<p>▲ Report on the Inspection by the Management Committee: The Takeover Committee ordered Special Commissioner Li Shengjun the day before yesterday to inspect Dachang, Liujiahang, Luodian, and Zhenru. Special Commissioner Li's report is as follows: (1) Dachang: Arrived at Dachang at 11:00 AM on the 12th and met with the commander of the Japanese army, Matsuno. It was said that the local infantry regiment and cavalry company had not received orders regarding the time of withdrawal and had no way of knowing. It was also said that there were about 30 soldiers stationed in the Gujiazhai area, who could be withdrawn tomorrow. There were about 600 shops in Dachang Town. The eastern part was completely burned down after the war, and only a few remote areas remained in the western part. Currently, about two-tenths of the residents have returned, and only a dozen shops have opened. (2) Liujiahang: Arrived at Liujiahang at 12:00 PM. Our side has taken over the defense of the area since the 10th. Although the houses have not been destroyed, they are mostly empty. Of the original 200 or so merchants and residents in the town, only about one-third have returned. (3) Luodian: Arrived at Luodian at 1:00 PM. The area has been relatively peaceful since the takeover on the 10th. Of the original 2,000 or so merchants and residents, about six-tenths have returned to the town. Half of the shops have reopened, and the entire town has not suffered any major losses. Only the items in the houses where the Japanese troops were stationed have been mostly destroyed. (4) Zhenru: Arrived at Zhenru at 3:00 PM and met with Major Hirai, the adjutant of the Japanese army. It was said that a Japanese regiment is currently stationed there, and there is no definite date for withdrawal. Also, the Takeover Committee yesterday ordered Secretary Yin Tixin of the Public Security Bureau and others to inspect Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Baoshan, and Yanghang. Their reports are as follows: (1) Zhabei: Arrived at Zhabei at 10:30 AM on the 12th and met with Major Katsuno, the commander of the Fifth Battalion of the Japanese army. When asked about the number of Japanese troops currently stationed in the area and the date of withdrawal, it was said that there are currently about 500 or 600 Japanese soldiers in the area. The date of withdrawal is scheduled for the morning of the 16th. It was also agreed that our side would send 15 or 16 personnel in charge of the takeover to the area at 9:00 AM on the 15th to conduct on-site surveys of the takeover zone and earnestly discuss the takeover procedures. It was also promised that two military police officers would be dispatched on the same day to lead the inspection. The area originally belonged to the Fourth District and had a population of 130,000 to 140,000. The area suffered the least from the war. All fire fighting, water, electricity, and other facilities are still intact. The area north of the railway and west of the Yokohama River originally belonged to the Fifth District. With Katsuno's introduction, we went to meet Major Mori, the commander of the First Battalion of the Japanese army. It was said that the area is located in the center of the war zone, and the rubble is unbearable to witness. (2) Jiangwan: Thousands of Japanese troops are currently stationed in Jiangwan. It is said that they have not yet received withdrawal orders. The town was almost completely destroyed by artillery fire. Only a few farmhouses outside the town remain.

<h3>Unreasonable Japanese Propaganda</h3>
<p>▲ Round Table Conference Cannot Be Held, Let Alone a Free City</p>
<p>▲ Britain, the United States, and Other Countries Express Sympathy to Us and Will Not Be Deceived</p>
<p>Since the Japanese troops who invaded Shanghai began to withdraw, the Japanese side has been doing its best to engage in propaganda for convening a round table conference and proposing the establishment of a free city in Shanghai. Yesterday, a Tokyo telegram reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa invited the ambassadors of the four countries, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, to a meeting to urge the convening of a round table conference and propose changing Shanghai into an international free city, which is openly contemptuous of legal principles and particularly absurd. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency originally intended to visit Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi to inquire about this matter. However, because Guo had just recovered from his injuries and was unwilling to see guests, he had a brief conversation with Guo over the phone. According to Guo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already expressed its opinion on the round table conference, indicating that it has no intention of accepting the conference at all. The round table conference cannot be held, let alone a free city. This kind of wishful thinking on the part of the Japanese side is just a kind of propaganda. When the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, Italy, and France were in Shanghai, they expressed considerable sympathy for our maintenance of Shanghai's security and other circumstances. The Japanese side's propaganda only shows that it is working hard and failing.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 14th said that Foreign Minister Yoshizawa invited the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy to a meeting last night in order to promote the convening of a round table conference and obtain the permanent security of Shanghai in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations Council on March 14. Yoshizawa explained to the four ambassadors the reasons for Japan's decision to withdraw its army from Shanghai and asked the four ambassadors to report this situation to their respective governments. According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, Yoshizawa advocated holding preliminary negotiations in Tokyo after the powers replied to the proposal issued by Japan last night. It is heard that Yoshizawa's proposal last night included changing Shanghai into an international free city, with a no-troop zone around the city, it is said.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 14th said that regarding the proposals made by Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa to the four ambassadors yesterday, according to the Nichinichi Shimbun, it included a proposal to change Shanghai into a free city with no troops allowed around it. The reporter specifically inquired with a responsible official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but his reply was not very informative. He only said that Yoshizawa explained the reasons for the Japanese government's withdrawal of troops to the major powers yesterday and expressed his gratitude for the mediation of the representatives of various countries in Shanghai's peace conference. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement, but it has neither confirmed nor denied the news from the Nichinichi Shimbun. This kind of extraordinary measure has attracted much attention from the outside world. French newspapers discuss</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Rapid Withdrawal of Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>▲ Powers Do Not Approve of Their Proposals</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Merchants Get the Benefit of the Fisherman</p>
<p>▲ Eager to Reverse Chinese Hostility</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Translated by Foreign Affairs News Agency, French newspaper, 13th: The Japanese government's sudden decision to immediately withdraw the Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai back to Japan has surprised people in this port and elsewhere. During the peace conference, the Japanese representative insisted for several weeks on opposing the stipulation of a withdrawal date, and the Japanese government has repeatedly stated that it cannot make concessions on this point. When the Committee of Nineteen declared that the Shanghai Joint Committee had the right to recognize the restoration of normalcy by a majority, the Tokyo government did not recognize the Committee of Nineteen. We therefore believed that this attitude of Japan was intended to occupy the Shanghai area for a long time. We speculated that there must be a hidden motive. Some said that they would open a Japanese concession in Shanghai, and some said that they would wait until the public concession was extended to Wusong before they would be willing to withdraw their troops. However, the day after the agreement was signed, the Japanese Minister of the Army transferred all his troops back and abandoned the "temporary stationing points" that his representative had struggled to obtain at the peace conference. This did not match what those who claimed to have learned the inside story said. However, the reasons announced by Japan for this sudden decision do not seem to be important. Earlier, the Japanese representative declared that the Japanese army would withdraw as soon as possible. We believed that its intention was to quell outside public opinion. However, there must be other important reasons that prompted the Inukai Cabinet to bring forward the date of troop withdrawal. Chinese newspapers and many foreigners believe that the withdrawal of the Shanghai garrison will be transported to Manchuria because the situation there has indeed become more serious in recent weeks. What they say is not without considerable reason, but it cannot be regarded as a definitive argument. If the Japanese had a plan in Shanghai, they might as well leave one or two divisions here, which would not hinder their actions in Manchuria, because Japan does not lack troops or material resources. The real reason for the withdrawal of Japanese troops is that the powers have not yet responded to them (Translator's note: refers to the free city proposal), and some countries are rapidly seizing the various benefits generated by the Japanese military invasion, and are ungrateful to Japan and repay them with evil words. The Tokyo government, feeling that it should no longer prolong its measures that are causing Chinese hostility and provoking blame from certain powerful countries that are benefiting at the expense of others, feels that it should no longer work for others. The Japanese must have thought that foreigners would take advantage of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai to amend the charter of this port. However, to achieve this goal, the powers must exert their strength. Unfortunately, the powers violated the wishes expressed by their expatriates in the concession's ratepayers meeting and did not think of using the opportunity to realize all or part of Judge Feetham's proposal. Official statements in Europe or Shanghai were all unfavorable to Japan. The unanimous condemnation of the Japanese military invasion of Shanghai. During this period, some foreign merchants and export companies slightly reduced their prices to attract Chinese merchants who were originally employed by the Japanese. The Yangtze shipping industry, Japanese merchant ships have disappeared, and their competitors have been able to monopolize the shipping industry. The Japanese government, perhaps thinking that it should no longer prolong this unwise strategy, and even more so, no one can recognize its efforts to expand the concession or the efforts it is willing to make, and be its confidant, so it resolutely withdrew its troops as early as possible and let people manage themselves alone. From today onwards, it seems that we should wait quietly and see whether the two major countries in the Far East, which are currently separated by various disputes, will be able to see goodwill again in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents' Meeting All Night Long</h3>
<p>▲ Still Not Awake from the Free City Dream</p>
<p>▲ Factional Disputes and Fierce Debate</p>
<p>▲ Summarize the Public Opinion and Decide to Telegraph the Government</p>
<p>Japanese residents in Shanghai, because of their opposition to their government's deadline for the withdrawal of troops and their advocacy of the establishment of a free city, have been holding secret meetings at the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Club on Wenjian Road for several days. Among the meetings, the one on the 13th was the longest, lasting from 5:00 PM to 7:25 PM. During this meeting, in addition to reporting on the progress of the past few days and the results of visiting various military and political dignitaries, no other issues were discussed. Therefore, after dinner, the meeting continued at 10:30 PM until dawn the next day before it was adjourned. The lights of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Club were bright all night. The debate was fierce at the conference table of each faction, but they were united in their opposition to the government's withdrawal of troops and their advocacy of the establishment of a free city. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency made every effort yesterday to inquire about the results of this meeting. The information obtained from the inquiry is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Factional Divisions</p>
<p>Since learning that their government had ordered the invading troops in Shanghai to withdraw within a month, all Japanese residents in Shanghai immediately organized the "Shanghai Japanese Residents' Group Emergency Committee" to plan opposition. However, the various factions within it, although united in their opposition to the withdrawal of troops and their advocacy of the establishment of a free city, had different opinions and different strategies. One is the moderate faction, led by Funatsu and Yoshida, who advocate trusting the government, obeying the orders of Army Minister Araki, and adopting a calm attitude to observe the final outcome. One is the radical faction, led by Yasui and Ikeda, who advocate immediately sending representatives back to the country to petition the government, striving for the necessity of Shanghai to urgently expand the area where foreign residents can freely live, and petitioning the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to immediately withdraw the order to withdraw troops and demand that the official army be temporarily stationed in Shanghai until the goal of establishing a free city is achieved, and then withdraw the troops. Otherwise, all Japanese residents in Shanghai will swear to oppose it to the death. Another is the compromise faction, with Horigura and others as core members, who advocate urging the government to send more naval landing forces to Shanghai for defense, because the government authorities previously had a declaration that the lives and property of Japanese residents in Shanghai would be protected by the landing forces. Now that the peace conference has been established, the lives and property of Japanese residents in Shanghai are still in danger, so the government should be urged to quickly fulfill its previous declaration to reassure the residents, etc. Although the opinions of the above three factions are very different, they have not awakened from their dream of "establishing a free city."</p>
<p>▲ Resolutions</p>
<p>The first meeting from 5:00 PM to 7:25 PM on the 13th was chaired by Teramura Hisakazu. First, the five representatives who were selected at the meeting on the 12th reported on the progress of their petition. Then, the chairman read out the full text of the two telegrams that had been sent. Due to time constraints, the meeting was adjourned temporarily. The attendees had a brief dinner at the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Club. At 10:30 PM, the meeting resumed to discuss further measures to be taken. First, the radical faction expressed its opinions, but the compromise and moderate factions felt that the means proposed by the radical faction seemed too radical and might not be accepted by the government. Therefore, they successively expressed their views and debated with the radical faction, but they expressed unanimous support for their advocacy of the establishment of a free city. Finally, Chairman Teramura Hisakazu, after listening to the opinions of the three factions, put forward the following proposals: (1) Telegraph the government again that the round table conference should be held in Shanghai before the "country's (the Japanese call themselves) troops are withdrawn." (2) Lodge a serious protest with the Chinese government to completely cancel all anti-Japanese movements. (3) Do not insist on opposing the government's order to withdraw troops by a deadline, but the government must guarantee that the goal of establishing a free city can be achieved. After the proposal was put forward by Teramura Hisakazu, all factions expressed their support. By this point, the meeting had reached 5:10 AM, and it was immediately adjourned. Copy of the Ceasefire Agreement</p>
<h3>Japan May Not Be Able to Sign</h3>
<p>▲ Because the Japanese Side Firmly Refuses to Modify the Chinese-Japanese Ceasefire Agreement According to the Original Intention</p>
<p>The Chinese-Japanese ceasefire agreement may not be signed tomorrow because the Japanese side firmly refuses to modify the points on "(dāng fēn sì jiān)當分四間" (for the time being) and "(fù jìn)附近" (nearby). The Japanese explanation of the two points on "當分四間" and "附近" is that they are the same as the words "暫時" (temporary) and "鄰接" (adjacent). After our side repeatedly refuted their errors, and explained the meaning of the English original of the agreement in extremely clear terms, that it meant "temporary" and not "at a considerable time" (according to the Japanese, "當分四間" means "at a considerable time"), the Japanese version of the agreement could not include words and sentences that were different from the original text of the agreement. "附近" (nearby) is also not the original meaning of the English words "毗連" (adjacent). The meaning of the word "附近" (nearby) is that two locations are not connected, but the distance is not too far, they can also be called "附近" (nearby). The word "鄰接" (adjacent) has the meaning of "倚角" (angle) in mathematics. Therefore, the meaning of the words "附近" (nearby) and "鄰接" (adjacent) is completely different, it is said. The two sides still did not have any contact on this matter yesterday, and only briefly discussed it on the phone. Our side inquired about the Japanese instructions and requested the Japanese side to find a way to modify it as soon as possible. It is heard that the result is still not certain. Whether it will be signed tomorrow depends on whether the Japanese side agrees to modify it, it is said.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 14th said that it was learned from a high-ranking official tonight that the National Government intends not to sign the Chinese and Japanese versions of the Shanghai truce agreement. This move has no impact on the agreement, because any disputes will be based on the already signed English version. The reason why the National Government has this opinion is that the translation of the Chinese and Japanese versions is not easy for both sides to accept. It is expected that the Japanese side will definitely agree, because there has been a similar proposal in Tokyo recently. National Crisis Association</p>

<h3>No War in Yuguan</h3>
<p>The Pseudo-State Police Act Recklessly. The Leshanbao Local Militia Disarmed. After the 9th, although the movements of the Japanese army in Yuguan in Shanhaiguan have slightly eased, the police of the pseudo-state are still very active and have become the focus of disputes.

They confiscated guns, ammunition, national flags, militia flags, militia uniforms, telephone boxes, and other miscellaneous items, and abducted the militia platoon leader, militia secretary, and others. The Linyu County government, upon receiving the report, negotiated with the Yuguan Japanese military police headquarters. The Japanese side replied that it was an incident of the "Manchukuo" and they could not interfere, resulting in no outcome from the negotiations.

<p>Qin Huang Dao, after a clash between the Japanese army and a unit of Zhang Xueliang's Volunteer Army near Yuguan yesterday, the situation has eased today, but the aftermath is still a cause for concern.

The area is currently patrolled by four types of military and police: the Chinese Railway Police, Zhang Xueliang's troops, the Japanese Railway Garrison, and the police force of the new government of Manchuria. The overall situation remains tense, and it is feared that a small spark could start a prairie fire.

<h3>The Question of Sino-Russian Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Karakhan Expressed to Mo Dehui. It Can Be Realized If China Proposes It.

Mo asked the government for instructions, but stopped because he did not receive a reply. The situation between Japan and Russia is very bad. After Japan's invasion of the Northeast, it propagated anti-communism. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs even announced the increase of troops in Vladivostok to defend against communism in the Northeast. Russia was extremely angry, exposing Japan's conspiracy in the Northeast and making substantial preparations. If the Japanese army in Heihe moves north again, they will resist, otherwise they will protect their graves. In mid-April, Dong Dehui went to Italy, and Wang Zhenshi took over Russian affairs.

<h3>Slight Debate Over the Postal Fee Increase Case</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the routine meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 14th, the issue of the postal fee increase was discussed and questioned. First, Qin Zhen reported on the Executive Yuan's reply. Then, committee members Zhang Zhihan and Wang Yongbin spoke, with the general idea: (1) This inquiry is not directed at any individual and does not exceed the scope of authority. To consider the Executive Yuan's reply satisfactory would be self-contradictory. (2) Since this case has now been decided by the Central Political Conference, it should be submitted to the Yuan for review, along with the operating budget. (3) The Yuan has the power to review the budget. Whether there are increases or decreases, a budget should be prepared and submitted to the Yuan for review. The Yuan should reply accordingly. The Executive Yuan stated that it could not set this bad precedent, and that this matter was not a dispute between Yuan and Yuan and did not require the intervention of the National Government Committee. Committee member Chen Zhaoying then spoke, saying that since a portion of the matter had been reduced, it seemed satisfactory. It was only necessary to submit the entire case to the Yuan for review and not to be overly demanding. Before Chen finished speaking, Wei Tingsheng stood up to refute Chen. The two sides argued slightly, but Qin Zhen dissuaded them and said that since this case had been decided by the Central Political Conference, the Yuan should wait a few days for the entire case to be submitted before further discussion. The majority agreed, and it was decided that the case would be temporarily reserved. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Administrative Enforcement Law Submitted for Review</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan, based on a report from the Municipal Government, stated that with regard to the penalty for overdue payment, the Administrative Enforcement Law stipulated during the Republican era distinguished between government offices based on rank, with fines below 30 yuan. This practice has continued for a long time and is not appropriate and that it is being revised by itself, lacks a basis, and requested an explanation. The Judicial Yuan was consulted, which replied that the matter concerned the scope of legislation and should be interpreted by the Legislative Yuan. The Executive Yuan then consulted the Legislative Yuan to formulate a separate Law on Administrative Enforcement. The matter was raised for discussion at the general meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 14th and was resolved to be submitted to the Legal Committee for review.

<h3>Russia and Japan Brewing War</h3>
<p>Sino-Russian alliance not far off, keen observations from British Labor Party members</p>
<p>▲Havas, London, 13th: Since last autumn, British newspapers leaning towards the Liberal or Labor parties have expressed hostility towards Japan, sometimes even intensely. Although the situation in Shanghai has improved and Japanese troops have withdrawn from Shanghai, this hostility does not seem to have diminished. Yesterday, the Daily People's Voice expressed suspicion of the decisions of Japan's senior military authorities, saying that the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai was only the prelude to a serious incident in Manchuria. Today, the paper again published an essay by former Labor Party member Camhuasu in a prominent position, titled "Asian War Clouds." Camhuasu fears that the recent tensions in Japanese-Russian relations, General Araki's declaration, and rumors of partial mobilization of Japanese troops in Siberia are a harbinger of a Japanese-Russian war. Camhuasu first described the so-called military plan to occupy the Russian Maritime Provinces, saying that the result of this will inevitably lead to a Japanese-Russian conflict. The Soviet Union will try to form an alliance with China, and the result of its efforts will be to bring the entire Asian continent together with the Soviet Union. In the future, major disturbances may occur in northern India and even in Japan itself. Camhuasu believes that the most frightening thing is that countries around the world will also be gradually drawn into the vortex. In order to avoid this disaster, measures should be taken now to adopt preventive measures ("before the first shot is fired"). However, Camhuasu did not specifically explain what the preventive measures are. British Foreign Secretary</p>
<h3>Expresses Opinions on Arms Reduction</h3>
<p>Qualitative and quantitative reduction should be considered simultaneously, international forces are difficult to implement</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 13th: During a discussion on arms reduction in the House of Commons today, Foreign Secretary Simon made an important speech, saying that Article 8 of the Treaty of Versailles stipulates that German arms reduction is the first step towards general arms reduction and limitation, and the Locarno Treaty also states that Article 8 of the Treaty is a tool to promote effective arms reduction. The holding of the arms reduction conference is essential to achieve this goal. The declarations at the conference, to be translated into practical form, have two methods: quantitative and qualitative. He believes that both methods should be pursued simultaneously. The purpose of qualitative arms reduction is to prohibit the use of powerful offensive tools, so as to avoid the relative weakness of the defending side and make it difficult for the attacking side to launch a fatal attack immediately. Therefore, arms reduction must not only proceed from the quantitative aspect, but also from the qualitative aspect. What is currently being discussed at the conference is the security theory proposed by France and Germany. Germany's theory is based not only on substance, but also on politics. Germany believes that it is participating in the conference on an equal footing with other countries, and this issue of status is extremely important, as it raises the question of what the status of German armaments will be in the future. The French memorandum advocates the establishment of international forces. As far as he is concerned, no matter what is said in favor of international forces, if there are international forces, there must be an international commander and an international staff. However, the individual staff members are not of an international nature, but of a national nature. The staff members will belong to countries A, B, and C. He fears that serious difficulties will arise as a result, and they cannot be resolved. Assuming that country A invades country B, the international staff's duty is to plan the best way to bomb the cities of country A. The international staff's strategy, since it is formulated by staff members from various countries, how can this strategy be maintained and hoped that this strategy will not be leaked before it is implemented? Or can it be implemented without much change? What kind of concept should be held about the future of this international force? Is it developing along the lines of an international police force of the League of Nations? Or is the League of Nations increasing its power as an organ of world public opinion? He believes that when difficulties arise, world opinion has a deep-seated agitation and a clear expression, then its effect is extremely great. If so, there is no need for a police force. If not, even if there is a proper command guidance, Simon continued to explain his attitude towards the arms reduction conference, saying that he has limited optimism about the results of the arms reduction conference, but has unlimited determination to pursue the best possible results.</p>
<h3>Coalition and Division of French Parties</h3>
<p>Radical Socialist Party influences political situation</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Paris, 13th: Today, French political circles predict that when the new parliament opens on June 1st, there will be important changes in the coalition and division of various parties. The Radical Left (the central faction) will split into two. A small faction, led by former Aviation Director-General Laurent-Eynac, will join the left-wing Radical Socialist Party. If so, the Radical Socialist Party will have a total of 170 seats. The remaining members will join forces with the Bourin faction to form an independent Radical Party. This faction is willing to support any government that has no relationship with the Socialist Party. Also, the Democratic Socialist Party, formerly led by the late Army Chief Maginot, will be completely dissolved. Its members will join the Independent Republican Party led by Taittinger. ▲Havas, Paris, 13th: As a result of the French Chamber of Deputies re-election, the left wing won a great victory. The most hotly debated issue among French political figures at present is what attitude the Radical Socialist Party will take. Will it join hands with the parties to the right of the party, or will it ally with the Socialist Party? From some perspectives, the current new Chamber of Deputies is the most left-leaning in the history of the French Republic. During the 1924 Chamber of Deputies election, the left-wing alliance formed by the Radical Socialist Party, the Socialist Republican Party, and the French branch of the Socialist Party/International Labor Party, although victorious, still failed to form a majority party, so it had to win over the Lucier faction of the Radical Left. As for the present, the situation is very different. The above-mentioned three parties occupy an absolute majority, and the comparison of the mutual strength of the three parties has also completely changed due to the victory of the Radical Socialist Party. In short, the current power of the Radical Socialist Party is sufficient to influence the political situation. It plays an important role in this Chamber of Deputies, even if it changes its attitude in the future and takes the opposite decision, it is not surprising.</p>
<h3>Lindbergh Baby Cremated</h3>
<p>Hoover Orders Strict Arrest of Kidnappers, National Outrage Reaches Extreme</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 13th: When Colonel Lindbergh's beloved son's remains were discovered, he was on a yacht at sea, still hoping to find the kidnappers and his son's last whereabouts and redeem his son and take him back home. The police on shore had specially set up a radio to communicate with the yacht when necessary. Unfortunately, at this critical moment, the yacht's radio was damaged, so Lindbergh did not receive the bad news until nine hours after the child's body was discovered. He immediately returned to shore and took a fast train 200 miles to Hopewell, extremely exhausted, but still trying to maintain calm, wanting to see his son before the coffin was closed and inspect him by opening the shroud. He then immediately cremated him. Only Lindbergh and his lawyer were present. After the cremation was completed, Lindbergh shook hands with the crematorium director and thanked him, without saying another word. When Lindbergh examined his son's body, his face was tragic. After carefully examining the child's teeth and toes for several minutes, he told the local prosecutor that it was indeed his son's body. Afterwards, he handed over several letters he had received from the kidnappers to the police. After the news of Lindbergh's son's death spread, the whole country was extremely angry. President Hoover also issued an order to search for the kidnappers. Hoover sent a letter to the Lindbergh couple today to express his condolences, and then issued instructions to various administrative agencies and detective teams, instructing them to strictly arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice. There was a kidnapping case in Chicago, and jurors were originally scheduled to be appointed for trial today, but public resentment has reached a boiling point, so the court has granted the defendant's lawyer's request to postpone the appointment, because there can be no fair jury until public anger has subsided somewhat. The above country is a photograph of Lindbergh's son taken before he was kidnapped. Standing on the right is Lindbergh's wife, sitting on the left is his grandmother, and sitting in the middle holding the son is his great-grandmother. ▲National News Agency, 13th, relayed from London: After Lindbergh's son's body was discovered yesterday, Colonel Lindbergh personally went to the morgue here today to identify the body, and then transported it to Lintim for cremation in a hearse. Mrs. Lindbergh did not come to see this tragic scene because she will give birth soon. Many people gathered in front of the morgue, but Lindbergh left through the back door to avoid seeing them. At present, all detectives in the eastern United States have been mobilized to investigate the kidnappers in this case, and the people of the whole country are also very shocked by this tragedy. Newspaper editorials all advocate maintaining law and order and eliminating bandits. ▲Havas, New York, 14th: The place where Lindbergh's beloved son's body was found is now guarded by troops, and a wall has been built around it to preserve the original state for investigation. Before the body was discovered, the kidnappers were still planning to extort another $200,000.</p>

<h3>Request the Deposed King's Slap in the Face</h3>
<p>Causing harm to the country by using intimidation</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Marseille, 13th: When the deposed King Alfonso of Spain disembarked here today, he was beaten by a Spanish worker. After a doctor's examination, he only suffered a minor skin injury on his right cheek. When Alfonso walked down the suspension bridge, his son Juan was on the ship to greet him and followed him. The worker suddenly stepped forward and punched him. The deposed king was also good at self-defense. His son quickly stepped forward and hugged the attacker until the police arrived and handed him over to the police. The worker, surnamed Messanier, 38 years old, confessed at the police station that he did not intend to seriously injure Alfonso, but only wanted to scare him. He did this because Alfonso caused great harm to the country. As for the deposed King Alfonso, although he encountered an accident, he remained calm and immediately entered a car and drove to the hotel. It is reported that he will go to Paris the day after tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Observations on Recent Political Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>Rivalry between Tokonami and Suzuki factions, Fascist movement becomes apparent</p>
<p>▲Japan News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: Railway Minister Tokonami's plan to purchase private railways is planned to be submitted to the special session of the Diet for approval. At this time of political tension, Okamoto, a member of the Diet from Tochigi Prefecture, suddenly announced his opposition to the plan yesterday afternoon and sent an opinion letter to the Prime Minister and all members of both houses of the Diet. His challenging attitude towards Railway Minister Tokonami is said to be backed by Mori Kanenaga of the Suzuki faction. It is generally expected that this is a conspiracy by Suzuki. Thus, Suzuki's resistance to Tokonami has become apparent. This time, Railway Minister Tokonami is determined to purchase private railways and persuaded Finance Minister to use 30 million yen in public bonds as funding. If this plan can be passed by both houses of the Diet, Tokonami's methods will be recognized by the people, and his success will not only overwhelm the opposition party, but also increase Tokonami's power in various places. The Suzuki faction observed the progress of this situation in advance and openly began to challenge recently, implementing counter-propaganda and hindering the passage of the plan through both houses. The fascist movement problem centered on the military and the vice-chairman of the Privy Council, and the Suzuki-Tokonami opposition problem that occurred this time have already become apparent. The atmosphere at the special session of the Diet is indeed gloomy, and the central political situation is becoming increasingly tense. Important news</p>
<h3>Report on Alliance Among England, America and France</h3>
<h3>Consistent Policy Toward Japan on Northeast Problem</h3>
<h3>Unwilling to recognize Manchuria as independent nation</h3>
<h3>Japanese pay the most attention to diplomacy toward France</h3>
<p>Correspondent Eito Okuma of Osaka Mainichi Shimbun telegraphed from Geneva that even though the Shanghai issue has ended, the focus of most people is still on the Manchurian issue. When Secretary of State Stimson, who was sailing back to America from Cannes on the 4th of this month, seemed to be focusing on the arms reduction issue on the surface, his major mission was actually diplomatic dealings with Japan regarding the Manchurian issue, discussing a political agreement with the highest officials of the English and French governments. It seemed that in the past, because Secretary Stimson alone led the American actions against Japan, which caused relationships between the two countries to worsen, that this was not a good plan. Therefore he then went on to take unified action with the Allies. Hence after Manchuria became independent, the recognition of Manchuria from each country has become a major issue. Now that Secretary Stimson is using established policy to invite England and France, planning to establish a common policy for the three countries in dealing with Japan, he worked tirelessly to realize the claim, running around in Geneva. According to recent reliable sources, regarding Manchuria, with Secretary Stimson's maneuvering, a political agreement has been established among America, England and France, but the contents of the agreement are not yet clear. However the fact that both England and France are following America's lead and not recognizing Manchuria as an independent nation, cannot be concealed. Therefore, not only must Japan use extreme consideration in diplomacy toward America, but diplomacy toward England and France will increase in importance in the future. In particular, the prior neglect of French diplomacy should now be given great consideration. The world's diplomacy today, in the sphere of international relations, does not allow for ignoring France's influence. Chairman of American naval affairs proposes</p>
<h3>Extreme Naval Expansion</h3>
<p>▲ Preparing for a Far East War ▲ Also Intending to Warn Japan ▲ Expressing Sympathy for the Weak ▲ Safeguarding Chinese Territory</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reports that Senator Hale, Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee of the United States Senate, recently introduced a bill to expand the navy to the maximum extent possible based on the London Treaty. The bill was reviewed at a Senate meeting on the 4th. On that day, Hale explained on the floor the reasons for strongly advocating naval expansion. He stated that although the United States is currently standing outside the war zone, it must prepare a sufficiently superior navy for future defense. As for the proposals to reduce the danger of war and reduce armaments, they are not worth considering. The bill I am proposing is based on the position insisted upon by the U.S. representative at the Geneva International Disarmament Conference. The Washington and London naval treaties state that the United States has no danger of war and no need for armaments. It is difficult to acknowledge this kind of argument. Considering the uneasy situation in the Far East, I am paying close attention. The international treaties we once trusted can no longer achieve direct results. The credibility of various treaties has fallen to the ground, leaving no trace. Therefore, it can be said that we are completely disappointed in safeguarding future wars. Moreover, according to the current situation, although the people are tired of hearing about war, most people are still afraid of the imminent approach of war. At this time, I will warn Japan that the United States' naval defenses in the Pacific agree not to strengthen, with the aim of safeguarding China's territorial integrity and the Open Door Policy. Since the Washington Conference in 1922, the United States has been at the forefront of disarmament. Unexpectedly, today the situation in the Far East is becoming more and more dangerous, and the United States Navy is at a very disadvantage. Therefore, it is necessary to change policy as soon as possible and fully expand to the maximum extent possible.</p>

<h3>Reasons for the Tight Situation at Yuguan</h3>
<p>▲ Talk by the Director of the Yuguan Public Security Bureau ▲ He Zhuguo Refuses Unreasonable Demands from the Japanese</p>
<p>A Beiping dispatch reports that train No. 102 on the Beining Railway arrived in Beiping from Shanhaiguan yesterday (the 10th) at 10:20 a.m. Mr. Lu, the director of the local Public Security Bureau, came to Beiping. According to him, since the League of Nations investigation team went to the Northeast, the Japanese have repeatedly provoked incidents in Yuguan. Local military and political authorities, fearing trouble, have tried their best to prevent it, and the Japanese conspiracy has not succeeded. It happened that a Chinese bandit leader, Wang Dapeng, nicknamed "Flying Horse Fast Gun Wang Er," kidnapped a civilian woman to be his concubine. The woman, resentful, stabbed Wang Er but failed and fled. Wang Er then searched everywhere for the woman to take revenge. The woman, fearing the bandit's ferocity, hid in the Japanese street. Wang searched and harassed in the Japanese street. Therefore, the Japanese military police regarded Wang as a volunteer army and took the opportunity to arrest our Chinese merchants and civilians, entering people's homes without permission, and demolishing the ceiling of the rooms to search for guns. Other acts such as rummaging through boxes and cabinets were even more unscrupulous, causing deep anxiety among the people. On the 5th of this month, several people, including the Japanese Civil Administration Police Chief Okitsuka and Takeda, led 200 Koreans from Jinzhou and others and suddenly occupied the station buildings and the telegraph office. At the same time, a false national flag was erected at the station, with the words "General Headquarters of the Manchurian Empire Border Surveillance Police Team stationed in Shanhaiguan." These false police officers, in groups of three or five, harassed merchants and civilians and interfered with railway administration. After negotiations by local railway staff and military police, no results were achieved. At this time, a Japanese division was increased in Suizhong County, and eight Japanese destroyers came from Qinhuangdao. Other important passes, such as Jiukou, were equipped with gun emplacements and electric nets. After nightfall, the Japanese deliberately fired guns and cannons to disrupt public order, causing extreme panic among the merchants and civilians. Therefore, a Japanese staff officer, Maeda, was sent to the 19th Brigade Headquarters to meet with Brigade Commander He Zhuguo, requesting that he sign a document allowing the Japanese army to have the right to freely dispatch troops to suppress bandits within eighty li of Yuguan. He replied that the bandits in Chinese territory would naturally be suppressed by the Chinese army, and there was no need for others to do it for them. My brigade</p>
<h3>The Situation in Changchun on May 3rd for the League of Nations Investigation Team</h3>
<p>In the front row, the person sitting in the middle is Sir Lytton, to the right is the Earl of Maugham, and to the left is Zheng Xiaoxu, the prime minister of the puppet state. He also said that if anyone harms the merchants and civilians within my jurisdiction, I will do my best to deal with them. Even if I am crushed to pieces, I cannot allow the merchants and civilians to be in danger. If the Japanese army wants to freely suppress bandits, they must first give me a signature. If they harm my merchants and civilians, the Japanese army will be responsible. Only then can I give the Japanese army a signature. The Japanese staff officer was speechless and left. Now that the Japanese intimidation tactics have failed, they are using plainclothes agents and traitors to disrupt Yuguan in order to create an opportunity and achieve their conspiracy. Therefore, the local military and political authorities are implementing precautions, with a curfew from 8:00 p.m. every night until 6:00 a.m. the next morning. The market is still very lively during the day, but at night, traffic is cut off, and there are no pedestrians. The Japanese run around everywhere, and the military police cannot stop them. Now, my 19th Brigade has a strong force, and the defense is very solid. There are troops stationed along the Beining Railway, such as Haiyang and Funing. Local security can definitely be assured.

<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Thoughts</h3>
<p>▲ Regretting Jiang Guangnai's Resignation ▲ No News of Chen Jitang Inviting Him to Guangdong</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Yuxiang, who has been recuperating in Mount Tai for a long time, has declined to meet guests, so most visitors have not been able to see him. Recently, a member of Feng's staff gave a detailed account of Feng's recent situation, saying that Mr. Feng's condition has improved, but his phlegm, asthma, and cough have not improved. However, the doctor advised him not to take any more eye medicine, as it would hurt his intestines. However, the recuperation method can not only cure phlegm and cough, but also restore physical and mental strength. Therefore, in addition to writing and reading, he walks in the nearby mountains, forests, and fields, and takes deep breaths in the morning. Because it is suitable for recuperation in a quiet environment, many guests from various places cannot be received in person, and I think everyone will forgive him. As for Mr. Feng's arrival here, it was to avoid trouble and recuperate. He does not often talk about political issues on weekdays. However, his views have been published in various newspapers many times before, and he still remains true to his original intention. As for his feelings, he talked about the news a few days ago that Jiang Guangnai's resignation was about to be approved, and he was very emotional and indignant. Jiang Guangnai was one of the main generals in the Shanghai Battle, and he had contributed to the country and the nation, so he regretted it very much for him. Today, he saw in the newspaper that Jiang Guangnai's resignation had been rejected. The will of the majority of people is always useful. There is no news here of Chen Jitang inviting Mr. Feng to Guangdong, which is probably a misunderstanding. A few days ago, the newspaper reported that Sun Lianzhong had gone to Shanghai on Feng's orders. Just as I was surprised, I saw Sun Lianzhong's denial in the telegram, which has been published in various newspapers, which shows that rumors are unavoidable. Wang Jingwei</p>
<h3>Sends Wang Maogong to Ji'nan</h3>
<p>▲ Reporting on the Shanghai Incident and the Guangdong Incident</p>
<p>A Jinan dispatch reports that Wang Zhaoming, the president of the Executive Yuan, has now specially dispatched San Maogong, the director of the Zhengtai Railway Bureau, to represent him in Lu, to meet Feng Yuxiang in Mount Tai, and to visit the chairman of the province in Jinan to discuss matters. Mr. Wang arrived at Zhong'an at 3:00 p.m. on the 9th and immediately went to Mount Tai to visit Feng at Puzhao Temple. He left Tai'an at 10:00 a.m. on the 10th and arrived at Yangjinan Hotel in Jinan. According to Wang, he met Mr. Feng in Tai'an, and Mr. Feng's illness has recovered, but he still has a cough. There is no news of the Guangdong side inviting Feng to go south. Li Xiehe is also in Mount Tai and will go to Beijing soon. My coming to Ji'nan is on the orders of President Wang to see Chairman Han, and there is no special task. When the reporter asked whether the Zhengtai Railway had stopped being taken over, Wang replied that it had not stopped being taken over and that all procedures were being handled. Today (11th) at 2:00 p.m., Wang went to the provincial government to visit Han Fuqu and left at about 3:00 p.m. Han has scheduled to hold a banquet for Wang at the provincial government tomorrow (12th). It is reported that Wang plans to take the Pingpu train to Beiping tomorrow night to meet Zhang Xueliang. Today, Han Fuqu told the reporter that Wang Zhaoming's dispatch of Wang Maogong to Lu this time has roughly two meanings: (1) The Shanghai Ceasefire Conference Agreement has been signed, and I am deeply afraid that the outside world will not understand the difficulties of the central government and the diplomatic authorities in the negotiations, which will lead to misunderstandings. Therefore, I have sent a representative to Lu to personally state the process of the meeting and the actual situation in order to dispel doubts. (2) Recently, Chen Jitang and others in Guangdong have had disputes over the issue of the navy's change of affiliation. The outside world does not understand the truth of the incident, which has led to various rumors. Therefore, I have sent Wang to Lu to report on the incident in order to quell the rumors. As for Wang's task of going to Tai'an to meet Feng, it is purely to visit Mr. Feng's condition. Also, Wang Maogong told people after meeting with Han Fuqu that Chairman Han is doing well and has not expressed anything. I will go to Ping in the next few days and return to Zhengtai Road. (11th) Wan Bi suggests</p>
<h3>Last Resort for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>▲ Hold a National Disaster Relief General Donation Week</p>
<p>Our country's disaster relief efforts have been disrupted by the sound of Japanese cannons since the September 18th Incident and the Shanghai Battle. Now the disaster situation in various provinces is becoming more and more serious, and the disaster relief authorities in various places have repeatedly sent urgent telegrams to the Disaster Relief General Association, requesting continued relief. Zhu Qinglan has only raised 7 million yuan in donations from last year to the present and has borrowed 450,000 tons of American wheat, which has long been distributed. Now there is no surplus power to continue to provide relief, and there are still about 60 to 70 million disaster victims in various provinces who have fallen into a desperate situation. I really can't bear to sit idly by. Therefore, I have telegraphed to all parties to appeal and intend to revive the disaster relief atmosphere again and seek the last resort for the disaster victims. Wan Bi, the vice president of the World Red Swastika Society of China and a member of the National Government Relief Committee, specially telegraphed to Zhu yesterday, explaining that since this is the last resort, if the usual methods of raising donations are still used, it may be difficult to obtain good results. Therefore, I suggest holding a "National Disaster Relief General Donation Week," that is, a national general mobilization, for a last large-scale relief. There are still 300 million people in the country, excluding those who are absolutely incapacitated. If each person only donates a few jiao, a huge sum of 120 million yuan can be raised. The methods determined are as follows: First, a national disaster relief general donation will be held. This donation is planned to be held within the shortest possible time from the date of decision, and a national disaster relief general donation week will be set. It is planned to temporarily divide the donation amount into five grades, with the minimum limit being 2 jiao as the starting point, and each increase of 2 jiao will advance one grade, totaling up to 1 yuan. That is, the fifth-grade donation is 2 jiao per person, the fourth-grade donation is 4 jiao per person, the third-grade donation is 6 jiao per person, the second-grade donation is 8 jiao per person, and the first-grade donation is 1 yuan per person. Now, assuming a family of ten, in the lowest limit, the amount donated by this household can be 2 yuan. In the highest grade, the amount donated by this household can be 10 yuan. These five grades of donations will be recognized by the people themselves and will not be forced. However, at least one grade of the lowest grade donation must be recognized. Those who can recognize the higher grades are welcome. Those who can make greater compassionate vows outside of these five grades and independently donate thousands or hundreds of millions of yuan will be especially welcome. Those who donate more money will be recommended by the Disaster Relief General Association to the government for commendation in order to encourage them. Those who can designate special disaster areas, donate huge amounts of relief money, and save the lives of a large number of disaster victims can also be designated by the local government to build statues in the relief area to highlight their good deeds and last forever. In total, the current national population is 450 million people, and the number of disaster victims in various provinces, although there are no accurate statistics yet, is only 60 to 70 million people in total. The majority of people in the country should be able to save this minority of people. Second, we must quickly find ways to continue to borrow American wheat. The 450,000 tons of American wheat borrowed for the flood relief this time, although the distribution in various provinces is not very sufficient and the work relief and agricultural relief cannot be thoroughly relieved, the disaster victims in various provinces have been able to survive from last year to the present, and the American wheat has also been of great help. Therefore, it is advocated that a large-scale final general donation should be carried out quickly to raise relief funds, and the government should still be consulted to quickly continue to borrow a large amount of American wheat and rush to transport it. If the fundraising is slightly successful, the transportation costs can also be paid from it. Suppressing bandits in Hubei Province</p>
<h3>Clear Out Within Four Months</h3>
<p>▲ Jiangxi and Zhejiang Will Each Transfer a Division to Assist ▲ Funding is Also Being Actively Raised</p>
<p>A Hankou dispatch reports that the Red bandits in Hubei Province have been repeatedly attacked, but they have not been completely eliminated. Last year, there was a Yong disaster, and starving people were everywhere. The bandits used coercion and inducement to replenish their forces. Therefore, the bandit forces became more and more rampant, and it became more and more difficult for government troops to attack. The most heavily red areas are Huang'an in eastern Hubei and Mianyang, Qianjiang, Tianmen, Yingcheng, Jingshan, and Hanchuan counties in central Hubei. Southern and western Hubei are relatively peaceful. Eastern Hubei is the territory of Kuang Jixun's gang, and central Hubei is the territory of He Duan's two gangs. Although Hubei Province is stationed with heavy troops, they cannot be concentrated in one place due to the limitations of the defense zone. However, its recent deployment and funding are more tense than before. According to the investigation of military deployment, such as in the central Hubei area, Zhang Zhenhan, Xiao Zhichu, and Xu Yuanquan's three divisions have all been sent to the front line to prepare for the second general attack. Xu has already taken a boat to Hanchuan on the 12th and transferred to the front to supervise the attack. Western and northern Hubei are paying attention to blocking at the same time. Western Hubei is guarded by the 36th Regiment of the Sichuan Army, stationed in various places and commanded by Wang Lingji. In addition to Liu Maoen's division, northern Hubei also retains a brigade of Fan Shisheng's troops stationed in Xiangyang to assist in blocking the attack. Eastern Hubei is attacked by Ge Yunlong, Zhang Yinxiang, and Peng Zhenshan's divisions, and southern Hubei is attacked by Xie Bin and Guo Rudong's divisions. In addition, there is also a saying that Hao Mengling's division stationed in Jiangxi and Shangguan Yunxiang's division stationed in Zhejiang will be transferred to Hubei to assist in the attack. It is also decided that all districts will be cleared out within four months. As for raising funds, in addition to the 420,000 yuan allocated by the provincial government every month, the Salt Affairs Inspection Office has also agreed to allocate 100,000 yuan every month. However, the Township Clearance Promotion Association is responsible for soliciting public bonds, but it is difficult to raise enough for a while. He Chengjian, the director of the Pacification Office, Xia Douyin, the chairman of the provincial government, and He Hengfu, the standing committee member of the Township Clearance Association, have proposed to mortgage the public bonds for cash to borrow 1.5 million yuan to meet urgent needs. In the future, the gentry and the wealthy will pay the public bonds they should have paid, and a committee will be organized to keep them and be responsible for repayment. As for the formal salary, He Chengjian has forwarded it to the Military Commission and requested an additional 500,000 yuan per month. The Military Commission replied by telegram that it would increase the issuance by 10% from this month. The promissory notes issued were requested by the generals to He and forwarded to the central government for relief. The telegram said, "We have found that the expenses of our troops, since the Ministry of Finance issued 70% of the promissory notes in the middle and late December of last year, the food of the various armies has been in panic. Especially during the Chinese New Year, the difficulties are even greater. We have appealed to the central government to request cash payment. The Shanghai Incident has had an impact, and these promissory notes have become waste paper. The amount of these promissory notes is nearly one million yuan, which is the food that each army should have received after the reduction. During the period before the due date, we still hope to cash them on time. We have borrowed from banks and money houses, and when we cannot cash them on time, we have to find ways to repay the loans from banks and money houses. For several months, the expenses of the various armies have been reduced and discounted, and the unpaid promissory notes have been issued. Even half of the half cannot be collected on time, so that the food of the various armies is always in danger of running out. We cannot make up for the deficit, and we cannot pay back the debt. We have been in a difficult and exhausted state for five months. Now that the bandits are rampant, the supplies of the various armies are so difficult, which has a great impact. We should earnestly request the exchange and issuance to facilitate the bandit suppression. For this reason, we respectfully request that you have compassion for the difficulties and quickly forward a telegram to the central government to urgently seek relief and convert the promissory notes issued to the various armies into cash in installments to be used for repayment and to maintain the status quo. Is this appropriate? Please give instructions to follow. Sincerely, Xu Yuanquan, Qian Dajun, Wan Yaohuang, Fan Shisheng, Xiao Zhichu, Guo Rudong, Zhang Yinxiang, Ge Yunlong, Peng Zhenshan, Zhang Wanxin, Xie Bin, Liu Peixu, Li Zongjian, and Li Dingwu Zhou kowtow."

<h3>Recent News on the Increase in Business Tax in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>▲ Officials and Merchants Have Reached a Stalemate</p>
<p>A Hangzhou dispatch reports that the business tax in Zhejiang Province, starting from April, regardless of the standard grade, has been uniformly changed to 10 per mille. Merchants and civilians in various counties have risen up to oppose it, but it has not been resolved. According to Wang Zhuzhai, chairman of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce, after the announcement of this case, the association requested exemption from the increase from various Ye Gong associations. The Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce also forwarded the request from the members of various chambers of commerce to withdraw the order. Repeated instructions have been given, all of which are to support the difficulties of the times and persuade various businesses to reluctantly overcome the difficulties. In this move by the government, the tax revenue can be increased by 4 to 5 million yuan per year, which is used to support the finances of Zhejiang Province. However, on the merchant side, the business tax is divided into whole sales and retail sales. Uniformly collecting 10 per mille, some have increased by 4 or 5 times, and some have increased by 8 or 9 times. How much can the merchant power bear? Moreover, it is at a time when the Shanghai War has just stopped, and all industries are reorganizing to seek development. If the increase is one or two times, the retailers may be able to reluctantly overcome the difficulties. Now the increase is too great, and the chamber of commerce advises them to support the difficulties of the times, and the merchants scold the chamber of commerce for not caring about the difficulties of the merchants. Therefore, the two sides are in a stalemate, and it is difficult to resolve.</p>
<h3>Wuchang Plane Arrives in Qingdao After Trial Flight</h3>
<p>▲ China National Aviation Corporation Expands Tianjin-Shanghai Line</p>
<p>A Qingdao dispatch reports that China National Aviation Corporation is expanding the Tianjin-Shanghai line and passing through Haizhou and Qingdao. It has telegraphed to the Qingdao City Government and the Navy to facilitate it. Today (11th) at noon, the company specially dispatched the Wuchang plane to Qingdao for a trial flight. The plane landed at Huiquan Bathing Beach and anchored in the sea in front of the bathing beach. The Navy Air Force sent people to greet it. The city government also sent Secretary Zhang Jianchu to the scene to receive it. Soon, the plane drove to the beach, and a group of people got off the plane, including Zeng Tong, the engineer of the company, Anlison, the chief pilot, Palin, the pilot, and one other Westerner and one Chinese (both assistants), totaling five people. They were invited to the team headquarters by Yang Junjing, the captain of the first squadron of the Navy Air Force, and Wu Guangdou and other team members to rest. According to engineer Zeng Tong, this trip is a trial flight. It departed from Shanghai yesterday afternoon and arrived in Haizhou at 3:00 p.m. that day. It stayed there overnight and flew to Qingdao from Haizhou this morning (11th) at about 10:00 a.m. It plans to stay for one day to survey a suitable location for stopping the plane in Qingdao in preparation for formal air service. It will fly to Tianjin tomorrow (12th). The fuselage of the plane is dark green, with the word "post" marked on both sides. The wings are silver-gray, and the words "China National Aviation Corporation" are written below. It takes about five hours to fly directly from Shanghai to Qingdao. (May 11) Local Communication</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>▲ Rioters Gather to Beat and Injure County Committee Members</p>
<p>On the 10th of this month, the Nanhui County Government sent Gao Keji, a member of the County Security Committee, to Liuzhao Town to investigate a case. Tang Yao, Ji Qingren, Huang Xin, and others involved in the case led hundreds of rioters to severely beat and injure Gao, seize official documents, and disarm and detain twelve police officers who were brought along. Later, although the escaped police officers sought assistance from the nearby security group, the rioters opened fire to resist the enemy, injuring many group members. Finally, the county government sent a large group of police officers to encircle and suppress them. Huang Xin, Lu Da, Zhang Yongbiao, and others were captured on the spot and sent to the county for legal action. Also, in the Huizhoudian area of the seventh district of this county, a large group of suspicious people suddenly arrived on the night of the 12th and advanced towards Hengmian. When questioned by the local security group, they were shot, killing two group members and injuring many others. After being surrounded and arrested, twelve people were captured, and the rest fled in all directions. It is rumored that it is related to the Liuzhao incident. The county government is currently sending teams to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>▲ Telegraphing to Request the Return of Farmland Used for Airfields</p>
<p>When the Japanese Kou were rampaging and our government was preparing to resist, the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs sent people to Songjiang and borrowed 300 mu of farmland outside the South Gate in the Jiutu area to build airfields, costing thousands of yuan. The fields were abandoned. Now that the agreement has been signed, the military affairs can be said to be over. The farmers all intend to recover their land for cultivation. Li Zuhua, Cai Guangyao, Wu Qianmei, and others, the directors of the Production Office, specially telegraphed to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, calling on them to allow the Songjiang County Government to quickly return the 300 mu of farmland borrowed for the airfield in accordance with the number for cultivation in order to restore people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲ Chamber of Commerce Explains Qian and Silk Industries</p>
<p>Silk factories in Wuxi have suffered losses in recent years and are on the verge of bankruptcy. They are unable to repay the debts owed to the silver and money industries. As the new cocoons are about to be put on the market, all the factories have decided to postpone the repayment of debts, request a reduction in interest, and borrow new money to help them. The Money Industry Guild is the intermediary for deposits and loans. If the loans cannot be repaid, the deposits will also be terminated at the same time. Qianzhuang has no way to turn stones into gold, and it will inevitably not be able to circulate. The decisions made by the silk factories have a great impact on the financial market. A general meeting was convened, and Jiang Huanqing, Chen Songxun, and Cai Yourong were appointed to consult the Chamber of Commerce for their opinions. The Chamber of Commerce believes that the factories borrow money based on their credit. If there are difficulties, they can only discuss solutions based on their past credit. There is no way to make a decision based solely on one-sided opinions. Therefore, it invited various members of the silk factory industry to explain separately and sent letters to the money and silk industries for reference.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Criminals in the Qishutan Robbery Case Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>Qishutan Town, a subordinate town of the county, was robbed by bandits a few days ago, and the police team's guns were confiscated. Later, the police team found guns and stolen goods in Wangjiahe, and the bandits involved in the case, Zhou Shengju (ie Zhou Er), Sun Wu, Shan Huaixi, and Xu Zhaosheng, were arrested in Zhenjiang and sent to the Superintendent's Office for interrogation. The criminals confessed without hesitation and confessed to the cases of robbing Jiangtai Class and the river port Ban Xiaolun. They were sentenced to death in accordance with the Regulations on Punishing Bandits and were taken to the execution ground outside the Fuyunmen bus station on the morning of the 12th for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>▲ Bandits in Yaojiadai Extort Huge Sums of Money</p>
<p>In Yaojiadai, Qin Hu Township, Lugang District, Rugao, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came to Zhu Hengtai's house late at night with flashlights and pistols. They broke into the wall and captured Zhu, extorting 400 yuan in cash. Zhu said that there was no surplus money at home. The bandits shouted, "Have you not heard of the Xu Shanfu family in Wangjiadai nearby?" (Xu was robbed and burned once last month and his mother was killed.) If you don't give us the money, we will burn and kill you in the same way. Fearing, Zhu handed over more than 200 yuan in cash. The bandits then took the stolen goods and roared away.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>▲ Water and Land Police Team Defeats Gang of Bandits</p>
<p>Hua'ao Mountain in Hua'ao Township, Nantian County, is an isolated island in the sea and is a den of pirates. A few days ago, bandit leader Xu Bangde led more than a hundred bandits to gather on the mountain, and the situation was very rampant. The Water Police Bureau sent the Yongping warship and the Second Water Warship to attack. Magistrate Li of the county also ordered Guo Yao, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to lead more than 40 police and security group members to attack. The bandits stubbornly resisted, and after three days of stalemate, they were broken by the government troops. Four bandits, including Xin Donghan and Zhou Changfa, were captured alive, and six hostages were rescued. The remaining bandits took advantage of the dark night to escape by boat.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Tragic Incident Arising from a Love Triangle with an Elderly Woman</p>
<p>Qiu Caichun, a farmer from Dongshanwu, Shangsi Township, Hang County, had been living with a 40-year-old woman, Ms. Li, for many years after they became acquainted. Unexpectedly, Ms. Li recently developed a relationship with a stonemason named Shunli, and viewed Qiu as a thorn in her side, leading to frequent quarrels. Yesterday afternoon, Shunli, carrying a wooden club, came looking for trouble and suddenly struck Qiu's head dozens of times. Qiu's head was immediately smashed open, and he died on the spot. Realizing the severity of his actions, Shunli fled the scene. The incident was reported to the police, who apprehended the adulterous woman, Ms. Li, and reported to the Hangzhou District Court for an autopsy. It was confirmed that the cause of death was head injuries. The body was placed in a coffin and prepared for burial. Currently, Ms. Li has been transferred to the court, and a strict search is underway for the murderer to bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>▲ Rampant Activities of Communist Bandits in Northern Anhui</p>
<p>The Communist bandits in western Anhui have been rampant for a long time. Although government troops have launched repeated suppression campaigns in the past, the Communist forces scatter and regroup constantly, making it difficult for the government troops to effectively suppress them. Currently, Chen Diaoyuan, the general commander of the First Route Army, is stationed in Hefei and has directed troops to defeat bandit groups west of Liu'an and near Sujiabu. However, Zhengyang in northern Anhui is now facing an emergency. Bandits from Huoqiu, Shou County, Fuyang, and the Henan border have taken the opportunity to join forces and are advancing eastward along the Huai River, threatening Zhengyang. It is reported that Communist propaganda slogans were recently discovered in Zhengyang. Although local authorities have implemented strict defenses, the severe spring famine has led many disaster victims to join the bandit ranks as guides. Yesterday, the bandits approached Zhengyang, causing widespread panic and a tense atmosphere in the town. Today (the 12th), telegraph communications between Zheng and Bengbu were suddenly cut off, and news has been completely blocked. This has caused anxiety and uncertainty in the area. It is currently unknown whether the town has fallen. If it is unfortunately lost, the entire Changhuai area will face serious threats. This intrusion by the Communist bandits appears to be a planned and organized operation. It is reported that the military authorities in charge of suppressing the bandits have telegraphed the central government requesting the dispatch of a larger force for joint suppression.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Resident Foreign Consuls</p>
<h3>Carefully Review the Registration Forms for Overseas Chinese Schools</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued an order to all resident foreign consuls, stating: "It has been found that various consulates abroad often fail to carefully review the registration forms of overseas Chinese schools that are to be forwarded. On the first day of this month, the Ministry issued instruction No. 110, ordering all consulates to thoroughly review the forms before forwarding them to the Ministry for record-keeping. However, a recent review of the registration forms sent by various consulates reveals that some have been carefully reviewed and found correct, while others still contain errors and have not been properly reviewed, which is a serious oversight. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated. Hereafter, all consulates shall be responsible for carefully reviewing the registration forms of overseas Chinese schools. Any discrepancies shall be returned directly to the original board of directors for correction. After verification and confirmation, the forms shall be resubmitted to the Ministry. The consulates shall be responsible for investigating or supplementing documents as instructed by the Ministry and shall not simply forward them without due diligence." In addition to issuing separate orders, the consulates are hereby urged to comply. This order comes from the Zhejiang Provincial Literacy Promotion Association.</p>

However, in the past, generals and lords who wore armor and yellow jackets often regarded education as a trivial matter, and were willing to spend the money for cultivating the nation's students on rouge and powder. The income of elementary school teachers was less than that of petty officials' servants, and the income of middle school teachers was less than that of ordinary chauffeurs. But teachers had to maintain appearances, and wear long gowns. They had to be tolerant of the imperial court, ingratiate themselves with superiors, associate with politicians, and dare not offend the gentry. As a result, they ended up demanding salaries due to unpaid wages. But no matter how loudly you cried out and how much you saw it as a matter of national survival, it was ultimately ineffective. After the establishment of the revolutionary government, education was valued more. However, news of teachers suffering from hunger and cold is still frequently reported in the newspapers. Although the salaries of teachers in Shanghai are better than those in the interior, the cost of living is high. Living beyond one's means is common, and there are even those who have not received their wages for the current month even though it is already half over. Schools have suffered greatly from this disaster, and few teachers have escaped being on the brink of starvation. The following are the number of teachers at various levels of schools and the number of unemployed teachers. According to the Municipal Education Bureau, there were originally 2,332 teachers in 33 public and private higher education institutions, 2,793 teachers in 125 public and private secondary schools, and 4,866 teachers in 774 public and private primary schools. It is currently known that 2,396 teachers at all levels of schools are unemployed, including 541 from higher education institutions, accounting for 22% of the original teachers; 663 from secondary schools, accounting for 24% of the original teachers; and 1,182 from primary schools, accounting for 27% of the original teachers. From this number of unemployed teachers, it can be inferred the situation of those now sitting on the cold bench. As for the loss of luggage, books, writings, beloved objects, souvenirs, etc. of the disaster-stricken teachers, the reporter has no way to inquire. I can only briefly talk about one or two examples to conclude this chapter. The following is an example: Mr. Zhou Jifan, who taught at the Patriotic Girls' Middle School, recalled a small story from the disaster. He studied Chinese classics and usually liked epigraphy and calligraphy. On the night of January 28th, he went through many difficulties to escape danger. Among the belongings left at the school were inkpads more precious than opium, stone seals that Bao Yu seemed to value, and a Chinese philology work that he had been working on for ten years. This was the effort of years, and it could not be bought back at any price. Now it has all become a dream at night. Zhou Yueran, an English writer, had all the English literature books he had collected over the years stolen. Liu Shimu of the Nanyang Cultural Research Department of Jinan University lost all his precious collections for studying Nanyang culture. Zhang Feng, an archaeologist, lost archaeological materials, ancient bricks, ancient tiles, ancient tripods, fossils, oracle bones, etc. that he had found over the decades. Yi Peiji's antiques, rubbings, and secret editions were all lost. Everyone has something they cherish in their life. These things may be easily found everywhere, but to find them, one may have to wear out iron shoes and travel all over China, expending a lifetime of effort. After the ruthless and evil artillery fire, I don't know how many thousands of people are sobbing and wailing, holding on to their resentment and anger for the rest of their lives. Unemployment may be short-lived, or there may be hope for re-employment. However, the loss of priceless lifelong treasures will cause permanent trauma to the soul. There is nothing that can comfort this deep wound. At the same time, it is a double blow to the future of culture. The armistice agreement has been signed, but has anyone considered the immeasurable losses of the masses and what kind of negotiations are being prepared to comfort the people?</p>
<h3>5. Cultural Tomb</h3>
<p>In the past, when people mentioned the Oriental Library, everyone would joyfully give a thumbs up and say, "(This is the only knowledge treasure house in the East)." Now, when people mention the Oriental Library, everyone's face reflects the tragedy in their hearts. The nation's most comprehensive public library, with the largest collection of rare books, has been buried in the gun smoke of the "Siege of Shanghai." It has gone with the spring breeze of 1921. (Heaven and earth may have an end, but this hatred will last forever.) Chinese people, remember it, remember it deeply. How much material value is there in this cultural tomb? Please look at the following list: A. Buildings: 96,000 yuan. B. Books: 2,152,000 yuan. 1. General Books (an average of three or four volumes bound together): 260,000 volumes of Chinese books, 154,000 yuan; 80,000 volumes of foreign books, 640,000 yuan; 5,000 sets of charts and photographs, 50,000 yuan. 2. Rare Books: Classics section, 274 kinds, 2,364 volumes, 1,000,000 yuan; History section, 996 kinds, 10,201 volumes, 1,000,000 yuan; Philosophy section, 876 kinds, 8,438 volumes, 1,000,000 yuan; Literary collection section, 1,057 kinds, 8,710 volumes, 1,000,000 yuan; He Family rare books purchased about 40 million volumes, 1,000,000 yuan; Local chronicles, 2,641 kinds, 25,682 volumes, 100,000 yuan; Newspapers and magazines, 200,000 yuan. 3. Catalog cards: 400,000 cards, 8,000 yuan. C. Business decorations: 28,210 yuan. Total loss: 2,276,210 yuan.</p>
<h3>6. Bookstores Suffer Calamity</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai became a trading port, it seems to have become the center of various industries in China. Many people say that Shanghai is also the center of culture. If this is true, then Zhabei, Wusong, and other places can be called the center of the cultural center. Bookstores are originally the source of intellectual food for the entire nation. The headquarters of China's only publishing industry is located in Zhabei, and many bookbinding factories are also concentrated in Zhabei. Now they have all been swallowed by the ruthless artillery fire. Every time we think of this, we can't help but feel grief and confusion about the future of culture. Everyone has shed tears of sympathy for the destruction of the editorial office and factory of the Commercial Press and will always remember it in their hearts and minds. There are also several unnamed heroic bookstores that have suffered disasters, but few people know about it. Take this opportunity to tell the people of the country.</p>

Yesterday (the 10th), four teachers who had been dismissed for a long time, Shen Shiyuan, Hu Yanzhi, Li Shousan, and Wang Sun, clashed with Director Jia Qixing when they went to the Education Bureau to demand back pay. They were taken to the county government, and County Magistrate Yang believed that Hu and others were disrupting education and arrested them all, waiting to transfer them to the court for disposition. All the teachers and staff in the urban area were shocked to hear the news.</p>
<h3>Disaster-Stricken Secondary Schools</h3>
<h3>Will Send Representatives to Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>▲ Requesting the Executive Yuan to Approve the Issuance of Cultural Bonds as Soon as Possible The Shanghai Municipal Committee for the Aftermath of Disaster-Stricken Schools held its second meeting at Nanyang Vocational School yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Representatives from Nanyang Vocational School, Guangdong Junior High School, Anhui Middle School, Xinmin Middle School, Patriotic Girls' School, Shibei Middle School, Fudan Experimental Middle School, and Women's Physical Education School attended. Wu Jiangleng was elected chairman. First, Zhang Xinsheng from Shibei Middle School reported that Zhu Jiahua, the Minister of Education, said, "(The current financial situation is difficult, and although there are no funds to restore Shanghai's cultural undertakings, we cannot but take responsibility for finding ways to help the disaster-stricken schools to recover. In the future, we can issue cultural bonds, using the British Boxer Indemnity as a fund, and the disaster-stricken schools should actively promote the sale.)" However, although Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education supports the issuance of such bonds, we should unite all disaster-stricken schools in the city to jointly organize a joint committee for the aftermath of disaster-stricken schools to petition the Nanjing government, requesting the Ministry of Education to propose the matter to the Executive Yuan and requesting the Executive Yuan to approve the proposal as soon as possible. Disaster-stricken universities have already elected Mr. Chu Fucheng and others as representatives, and this committee should also elect three representatives to jointly proceed with the representatives of disaster-stricken universities. Then, the agenda was discussed, and the following was passed: (1) Nanyang Vocational School, Shibei Middle School, and Patriotic Girls' School were elected as representatives by ballot; (2) Secretary Lin of Nanyang Vocational School was hired as the honorary secretary of this committee.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Educational Community National Salvation Federation Requests</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education to Provide Relief to Schools in the Songhu War Zone</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Educational Community National Salvation Federation submitted a document to the Ministry of Education requesting relief to schools in the Songhu War Zone, which reads: "Submitting a request for relief to the severely damaged schools of all sizes in the Songhu War Zone. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, areas along the Songhu Railway, such as Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Paotai Bay, have become war zones. The violent Japanese, relying on their naval, land, and air power, bombed and destroyed school buildings with artillery fire, and scattered books and records. The cruelty of their destruction of culture is even worse than that of Yingzheng. All colleagues in the educational community are heartbroken and furious. Now that the armistice agreement has been signed, it is especially important to restore all schools of all sizes that have suffered in the war zone, so as to avoid the suffering of young people who are out of school. Zi Yu said, 'If there is no propriety above, there is no learning below, and the rise and fall of bandits and people will not have a day.' It can be seen that the method of saving the country is not effective unless we first restore education. However, the losses suffered by various universities, such as Tongji, Jinan, Labor, China Public School, Soochow Law School, Shanghai Law School, Central Medical College, Business School, Chizhi University, and Fisheries School, are estimated to be more than 6.6 million yuan. The losses of secondary schools, such as Wusong Merchant Marine School, Shibei Middle School, Nanyang Vocational School, Hubbei Junior High School, Daozhong Girls' Middle School, Guangdong Junior High School, Huisheng Midwifery School, Lida Academy, Wusong Middle School, and Minsheng Junior High School, are estimated to be more than 2.36 million yuan. The losses of primary schools are also more than 400,000 yuan. More than 127 schools of all sizes have been plundered, with a total loss of assets of more than 9 million yuan. Most of the staff have been sent to investigate, and all schools have submitted damage reports, photographs, and descriptions of the war damage. The losses of other cultural institutions are not included. Moreover, various universities in the country have been in arrears with various expenses for several months. Now, with the damage caused by the violent Japanese, their economic difficulties are even more unbearable. At present, if we want to restore education, we should ask the Ministry to make a comprehensive plan and decide on all practical relief measures, so that schools may have a day of revival. According to the national expenditure statistics, education expenditure accounts for only a few percent. No matter which item is cut, it is not impossible to provide sufficient subsidies. In short, if the Ministry can have good methods and raise a large sum of money to be the nectar of restoring education, it would be a great blessing for the students. If it is not possible, we can only ask the Ministry to issue education bonds, and allocate a part of the British Boxer Indemnity as collateral, so that the fund for culture can be used for the cause of restoring culture. There is nothing better than this. The Ministry bears the responsibility for national education and loves the youth of the country as fathers and brothers love their children. We should share weal and woe and be closely related. This committee is pained by the unending national crisis and awed by the urgency of education. We dare to express our views, hoping to wipe out the shame. All the reasons for requesting relief for the losses of major and minor schools in the Songhu War Zone are included in the document for review and approval. It is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Education of the National Government. Hu Shuhua, Zheng Tonghe, and Wang Xiaoying of the Shanghai Educational Community National Salvation Federation."</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to</p>
<h3>Receive Cholera Preventive Vaccine Injections</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to all schools yesterday, stating: "The Department of Health's Official Letter No. 4380 states that everyone knows the harm of cholera. The preventive measures taken by this Bureau over the years have been quite effective. However, this year, the Shanghai area has been in a state of war for a long time. If preventive measures are not taken in time, a major epidemic will inevitably occur. Now that summer has arrived, the Bureau's prevention plan has been prepared and is scheduled to begin administering cholera preventive vaccine injections on the 16th of this month. All teachers, staff, and students of all major and minor schools in this city must complete the injections before the summer vacation. The injection dates will be determined by the Bureau and directly notified to each school. Fearing that the schools may not understand the principle or even resist accepting it, we are hereby writing to instruct all schools to accept the injections to prevent and protect their health. With the approval of this, we have checked that epidemic prevention is very important after the war. Teachers and students of all schools should accept the injections to prevent and protect themselves. The above order shall be complied with."</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Southern Indochina Save the Country by Reducing Food</h3>
<p>▲Two Million Taels of Silver Have Been Remitted Before and After ▲Funding for the 19th Route Army's Military Expenses During the recent invasion of Shanghai by violent Japan, the 19th Route Army rose up to resist. Since January 28th, it has been more than three months. During these three months, people from all over the country, driven by the same hatred for the enemy, have spontaneously and enthusiastically provided spiritual or material support to the 19th Route Army. The efforts have been great, and especially the donations from overseas Chinese have been continuously remitted to support the army's expenses, with the largest amount. Some have even initiated groups to reduce food consumption and remit the savings to support the 19th Route Army's anti-Japanese military expenses. According to news from Southern Indochina, Vietnam, after the 19th Route Army rose up to resist the violent Japanese on January 28th, giving the Japanese invaders a heavy blow, and the news of repeated victories reached Southern Indochina, the local overseas Chinese were overjoyed. They believed that the 19th Route Army could vent their anger after decades of being invaded and oppressed by the Japanese, and gave the Japanese a head-on blow. Their joy was more than 300 times. Therefore, the overseas Chinese in Southern Indochina at that time enthusiastically donated funds to support the 19th Route Army, and initiated the organization of the Overseas Chinese Food Reduction Association of Southern Indochina, Vietnam, to save military disasters and charities, in order to make it permanent. The association's purpose is to save money by reducing food consumption, support the front-line military expenses during the period of resisting the enemy in the motherland, and provide relief to military disaster refugees. After the war is over, the funds will be used to support national defense construction and shall not be used for other purposes under false pretenses. As for the food reduction method, shops are used as units, and each shop saves 20% of the daily vegetable expenses (for example, if a shop buys vegetables for one yuan a day, it saves two cents), stores it by itself, and pays the saved money once a week. The amount of money received by the association is completely public, and the amount of money received is announced once a week. The association is divided into executive, supervisory, publicity, registration, remittance, and consultation remittance departments. All office staff are volunteers and receive no salary. The initiators are He Dacong, Hu Zhigang, Zhang Yuting, Li Yihuan, Liang Puqing, Wu Jiongzhao, Huang Luzhong, Li Rilun, He Shangping, Cai Jingtang, Huang Yueting, Deng Xueru, Ye Tiansun, Lin Shuru, Yang Zhongfen, Tao Huting, Xie Zhibin, Wen Rongkai, Mai Gansheng, Zeng Gongwei, Zheng Junwei, Liang Zhiye, Zeng Ziming, Mei Fangting, etc. Among them, Lin Shuru and Zeng Ziming are from Minhou, Fujian, and the rest are all from Guangdong. Those responsible for handling affairs are He Dacong, Hu Zhigang, He Shangping, and Huang Luzhong. Those responsible for remittance are Ye Boxing. Those responsible for consultation remittance are Li Yihuan and Huang Yueting.

According to the news from the Shanghai Office of the 19th Route Army, the association has remitted 10,000 yuan of national currency by Mr. Ye Boxing, the chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, on April 6, and another 10,000 yuan on April 27, totaling 20,000 yuan. At this time of national crisis, our overseas Chinese are even reducing clothing and food to support the anti-Japanese military expenses, while the general magnificent ruling gentlemen often spend hundreds of gold on banquets, and 80 yuan a bowl of large fins is swallowed and chewed, and they still complain that there is no place to put their chopsticks. It can be seen that the difference in patriotism between the people and the traitors is as different as heaven and earth.</p>

The staff of the association accepted it on their behalf. When asked for the woman's name, she firmly refused to say, only writing (A foreign friend sends to the wounded soldiers of the 19th Route Army, the great heroes of China). Therefore, the staff of the association transferred it to Mr. Yin Zhiling, the representative of the National Salvation Federation of various groups attending the association, and sent the Han jade flower basket to the Red Cross Hospital to comfort the brave and patriotic wounded soldiers of the 19th Route Army.</p>

<h3>Pay Attention to Taxpayer Standing</h3>
<p>▲Case of Nanyang Employees Kidnapped by Japanese Troops ▲The Municipal Council Directly Negotiates with the Company According to the Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Concession Taxpayers Chinese Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Lead Printing Industry Association yesterday, which said, "Dear Sirs, regarding the case of the employees of the Nanyang Printing Company being kidnapped by the Japanese army, our association previously received a report from your association and immediately forwarded it to the Municipal Council for investigation and rescue. Subsequently, although the employees were released, the Japanese army should be held responsible for the damage caused during and after the kidnapping, and the perpetrators of the illegal act should be punished. Our association has also repeatedly sent letters to the council for negotiation, and on May 9, we sent the injury examination form and film of the injured worker to the council for investigation. Now, we have received a translated letter stating that it is a letter dated May 9 to forward the injury certificate issued by the doctor of the workers of the Nanyang Printing Company. After the incident, the bureau and the workers of the company immediately had direct negotiations, and there were also considerable steps to resolve the matter. A copy of the attached doctor's certificate has been ordered to be retained by the bureau, and the original is returned herewith." Accordingly, we found out whether the council's claim of having direct negotiations immediately after the incident and having considerable steps to resolve the matter is true. We hereby send a letter to your association to investigate and inform us of the subsequent progress. However, there is one word that we would like to ask you to convey, that is, when negotiating with the Municipal Council, you should pay attention to the position that (taxpaying citizens should be protected by the Municipal Council). Your association will be able to see this.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Burned Opium Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, from July 16 last year to February 8 this year, piled up the opium, opium pills, opium paraphernalia, gambling tools, reactionary publications, and counterfeit bank currency plates confiscated in various cases of violations of police regulations. Yesterday (the 14th) at 3 pm, in front of the office hall of the bureau, Zhang Shaoyi, the staff member of the Third Section of the bureau, and Xu Shaoxiu, the representative of the municipal government, checked the causes of the cases. After verifying each item case by case, they used kerosene fuel to burn all the items to ashes. Suddenly, smoke filled the air and flames soared into the sky. The bureau immediately notified the fire brigade by telephone to avoid misunderstandings. More Than Eighty Groups</p>
<h3>Responding to the Impeachment of Liu Ruiheng</h3>
<p>More than 80 important public groups in the city believe that Liu Ruiheng, the current Director of the Department of Health and Chairman of the Anti-Smoking Committee, previously encouraged the financial authorities to implement a disguised public sale of the Anti-Smoking Investigation Department, which was rejected by the Chinese people. Recently, he took advantage of the national crisis to secretly brew the revival of public sale. The Inspectorate Committee member Gao Youtang has filed an impeachment, but the authorities have not taken any action. In addition, the opium public sale in Jiangsu Province has been progressing rapidly, which is actually tacitly approved by the central anti-smoking authorities. If we do not rise up and strive for it, we are deeply afraid that it will be realized in the near future. Therefore, we especially jointly telegraphed the National Government Inspectorate to send a letter to the government and judicial organs, according to the impeachment case of Committee Member Gao Youtang, to punish the responsible anti-smoking authorities according to law, in order to emphasize anti-smoking and show determination. The telegram is as follows: Urgent Delivery to the President of the Nanjing National Government Inspectorate, Ziyun. It is found that since Liu Ruiheng has been in charge of the Central Anti-Smoking Committee, anti-smoking has been abandoned and is unbearable to hear. At first, he cited those who advocated public sale, such as Wu Liande and famous corrupt officials such as Li Jihong, and colluded with each other to make profits from poison, deceiving the government and trampling on the people. The Anti-Smoking Investigation Department was established in the front, and the Narcotics Management Agency was rumored in the back. Fortunately, with the spirit of the Premier in heaven and the strength of the people's resistance, the cold thieves were afraid and did not succeed. Recently, foreign insults have invaded, and the national crisis is imminent. When the people's attention is focused on foreign affairs, Liu believes that it is a good opportunity to stir up trouble, instigating various provinces to conduct opium public sales in order to disperse the people's resistance. The fact that the central government formally announced the public sale will also be realized in the shortest period of time. He painstakingly plans to speed up the country's demise. It is found that the anti-smoking laws have been promulgated and implemented by the Legislative Yuan, and the articles are all there. Opium business absolutely cannot be established by the National Government entrusted with the power given to it by the people and clearly recorded in the Premier's will. However, Liu is blinded by profit and risks not being ashamed, only seeking to indulge his private desire to amass wealth and flatter the superiors, and does not hesitate to take this measure that disregards the country and the nation, violating the will, destroying the anti-smoking laws, poisoning the people, and endangering the party and the country. It is impossible to list his crimes. The whole country wants to eat his flesh. Last year, a member of the Inspectorate Committee filed an impeachment, but the result was that there was no investigation. Now, Committee Member Gao Youtang has resubmitted the impeachment, which represents the public opinion of the people of the whole country. We are concerned about the rampant spread of drug disasters and the approaching prairie fire. We sympathize with the rejection of drugs and are determined to eliminate them. We pay special respect to Committee Member Gao's actions of fulfilling his duties and eliminating harm for the people. We urge the head of the court to maintain law and discipline, and to restrain the strong and violent. We will immediately ask the government and judicial organs to punish Liu Ruiheng according to law, so as to maintain the anti-smoking efforts and eliminate greed. This is really virtuous and convenient.

<h3>Tenant Association Holds General Meeting Yesterday</h3>

(3) Send a letter to the Municipal Council, asking why the new contract was not announced in advance to solicit residents' opinions before it was signed and took effect. It is said that the water company even used water cut-off measures, which is disrespectful to the landlords' position and deliberately hinders people's livelihood. (4) Resolved that the method of reducing and exempting rent north of Suzhou Creek shall be handled in accordance with the Municipal Council's method of exempting donations, and requested that the water company exempt water fees during the rent-free period, the electricity company exempt lamp fees, and the Municipal Council exempt land donations.</p>

<h3>Regulations Regarding National Product Certificates, etc.</h3>
<p>Because the Ministry of Industries recognizes that the regulations regarding national product certificates, etc., were all drafted three years ago by the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and that three years have passed, and facts have changed, the clauses have been appropriately revised, and the provincial and municipal governments have been notified to follow them uniformly. The Shanghai Municipal Government has ordered the Municipal Social Bureau to comply. Here is an excerpt of the original order:</p>
<p>Order to implement: Approved by the Ministry of Industries, Document No. 4048. It is about circulating matters. It has been found that the Regulations for Issuing National Product Certificates, Provisional Standards for Chinese National Products, and the Rules of the National Product Examination Committee were all drafted by the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the 17th year of the Republic of China and submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation by ministerial order. Now, more than three years have passed, and there have been considerable changes in the facts.

<h3>Lu Zuofu Advocates Going to the Inland</h3>
<p>▲ Lecture at the Industrial and Commercial Management Association. The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its 29th luncheon meeting yesterday at noon at the United China Association, inviting Mr. He Dekui to speak on the topic of "Industry and Commerce and Domestic Peace." It was learned that Mr. Lu Zuofu, a great industrialist from Sichuan Province, had come to Shanghai, and the association specially invited him to participate temporarily. Although the sky was gloomy and threatening rain, several dozen people attended. Mr. Hu Shuhua, a director of the association, presided over the meeting. After the meal, the chairman briefly introduced Mr. Lu Zuofu, who spoke, saying that the center of Chinese industry and commerce is not in Shanghai, but in the inland, especially in the border areas. Shanghai is merely a gathering place for Chinese and foreign goods. The raw materials for factories here mostly depend on foreign countries, while the resources of the inland are undeveloped, attracting the covetousness of foreigners. Once an incident occurs, there is no way to deal with it. We should advocate the slogan "Go to the Inland." He hoped that the people of the country would learn from the past and strive to catch up, seeking the development of inland industries, so that the Shanghai market could also prosper. Although there are wars and bandits in the inland, if we can bravely go there, it is not impossible to eliminate them. The situation in Sichuan Province is like this, he said. Then, Mr. He Dekui gave a speech, saying that in the past twenty years, our country has suffered from continuous civil wars. The direct responsibility lies with the warlords, but the people cannot unite and strive to stop them. We should also blame ourselves. At a time when foreign enemies are deepening, we should stop internal strife and promote domestic peace. The industrial and commercial circles have a stronger force and are concentrated in cities, making it easier to unite. We hope that everyone will follow the principles of self-help and national salvation, unite and eliminate civil war, and promote domestic peace, so that the future of industry and commerce can also be developed day by day.</p>

<h3>Verdict in the "Dangerous Words Daily" Case</h3>
<p>▲ The two defendants were each fined. Fan Shuheng from Hubei recently founded the "Dangerous Words Daily" in the French Concession and distributed it in the city. He did not register with the Public Works Department beforehand, and the newspaper did not publish the address of the office. Furthermore, the words and opinions exceeded the scope, which was discovered by Ma Muya (transliteration), the head of the political department of the French Concession police. He believed that it violated the regulations of the concession and hindered public security. It was found that the newspaper was printed by Junyi Printing House at 573 Edward Road. The owner of the printing house, Chen Linyi, was arrested first, and then Fan Zhiping, an employee of the newspaper, was arrested at 61 Xiafei Lane. One hundred and fifty copies of the newspaper and two sets of lead type were confiscated and taken to the police station, then sent to the Second Special District Court. The police charged them with violating the publication law and Article 187 of the French Consul's order. After Judge Zhang Chaozuo tried the case, the defendants hired lawyers to defend them. The debate was declared closed, and the date for the verdict was set. The defendant Chen Linyi was ordered to pay a bail of 500 yuan, and Fan was ordered to pay a bail of 200 yuan, pending verification. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. The defendants and their lawyers went to the court to wait for instructions. At 3 p.m., Judge Zhang presided over the judgment in the First Criminal Court. Fan Zhiping was fined 60 yuan for publishing a newspaper without applying for registration. Chen Linyi was fined 40 yuan for helping to publish a newspaper without applying for registration. If they were unable to pay the fines, they would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. Before the judgment was final, the number of days of detention would be offset against the fine at the rate of two yuan per day. One hundred and fifty copies of the "Dangerous Words Daily" and two sets of lead type were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Smooth Flow of Shanghai-Fuzhou Telegraph</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications on Sichuan Road has been striving to rectify the Shanghai-Fuzhou telegraph communication since the Xiamen submarine cable was taken over, as it is of great importance.

<h3>Business and Labor Representatives Postpone Trip to Beijing</h3>
<p>Chen Dongwu, Zhu Gongchui, Hu Kun, and Ma Weiqun, the representatives sent to Beijing by the Post-Disaster Relief Committee for Employees of the Commercial Press, were originally scheduled to depart today.

<h3>Striving for at Least One Quarter of Tax Exemption</h3>
<p>The Yangshupu Road, Huade Road, Yinxiang Port, Broadway Road, West Huade Road, Jiaxing Road, North Jiangxi Road, North Xizang Road, Haining Road, Aierjin Road, Jielu Road, Han Bili Road, Suzhou Road, and other business associations of the Hongkou District Branch of the Municipal Federation of Citizens believe that the Public Works Department of the Hongkou District has expressed a reduction or exemption of the patrolman tax, but the methods vary. Considering the severity of the damage to Hongkou District, the tax exemption is too small to be fair. Yesterday, a resolution was passed at a representative meeting to send a letter to the Municipal Federation and the Taxpayer Chinese Association, arguing on the basis of reason. The original letter is recorded as follows: We have received your letter regarding the Public Works Department's method of reducing or exempting the municipal general tax. We have found that since the January 28th Incident, the Public Works Department of the Hongkou District concession has allowed the Japanese army to commit atrocities, causing severe damage to the citizens. Even today, most of the businesses have not yet opened, and the scene is desolate. The commercial market has gone bankrupt, and the painful situation cannot be expressed in words. The merchants and people used to fulfill their tax obligations, but now they have lost their right to protection. Exemption from the general tax is a legitimate relief measure. However, the published methods of exempting taxes by district, such as January and February, are completely inappropriate. These inconsistent methods will only cause market disturbances. This case has been submitted to the representative meeting of the Federation's office. The Hongkou District should be exempt from the tax for at least one quarter as the minimum standard. In addition to notifying the merchants and people of Hongkou District to wait for the negotiation to achieve its purpose, so as to show fairness and alleviate the merchants' difficulties, we hereby submit this case for your review and diligent protest, in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. We hope to receive a reply.</p>

<h3>Jianghai Customs Discovers</h3>
<h3>Addiction Treatment Contains Toxic Substances</h3>
<p>▲Leiyu Pharmaceutical Company Accused ▲The Two Defendants Released on Bail Pending Trial Cai Yusheng from Guangdong has been running the Leiyu Pharmaceutical Company on Baoshan Road, Zhabei, specializing in selling Cai's Freedom Addiction Treatment Peace Medicine with the Flying Thunder trademark. It has been sold for four years and has been quite successful. The medicine is divided into four types, with the large size being 42 taels per bottle, selling for ten yuan; the next size is 28 taels, selling for five yuan; the next size is 24 taels, selling for three and a half yuan; and the smallest size is 10 taels per bottle, selling for one yuan and five jiao. Until January of this year, Zhabei was affected by the war, so the company moved to No. 22, Sanhe Lane, Jiangxi Road, and continued to sell. On the 25th of last month, the medicine was suddenly discovered by the Jianghai Customs, which reported that it contained a large amount of morphine and opium toxins, and reported to the Narcotics Department of the General Patrol Room. West Inspector Pan Gensi, Chinese Inspector Song Bingzheng, Detective Zhang Yushaoqing, Ding Gao, and others, acting on a search warrant from the court, went to the Leiyu Company on Jiangxi Road and arrested the shareholder, Cui Daosheng from Guangdong, and the manager, Zheng Ziqian from Guangdong. They also confiscated 83 boxes of the medicine, including 54 boxes of 10-tael bottles, 14 boxes of 24-tael bottles, 14 boxes of 28-tael bottles, and 1 box of 42-tael bottles, as well as a bamboo basket containing 19 10-tael bottles, 7 24-tael bottles, 4 28-tael bottles, and 3 42-tael bottles, and 172 taels of opium ash, one opium pipe, one lamp, and one tray, and took them all to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated that the police were prosecuting the two defendants for manufacturing and selling opium substitutes under Article 6 of the Anti-Opium Law, and Zheng Ziqian was additionally charged with possessing smoking paraphernalia under Article 13 of the Anti-Opium Law. This case was reported to the police by the Jianghai Customs, which said that the Leiyu Company was selling addiction treatment with the Flying Thunder trademark, which contained a lot of morphine. The police sent detectives on the 2nd of this month to purchase a small 10-tael bottle from the company for 1.5 yuan and handed it over to the Public Works Department's Health Department for chemical testing. It was found that the medicine contained 13% morphine and could replace opium. Therefore, the court was requested to issue a search warrant, and the above-mentioned medicines were searched and the two defendants were arrested yesterday. The chemical test report and the four types of medicines were presented to the court. According to the Chinese and Western detectives, the defendant Cui Daosheng claimed that he was an advertiser. The Leiyu Pharmaceutical Company had a total capital of 5,000 yuan, with each share being 100 yuan. He had one share. The company was originally in Zhabei, but moved to Jiangxi Road this year due to the war. He was helping out there, greeting customers when they came. However, the medicine was registered by the owner, Cai Yusheng, with the Nanjing government in 1929. He did not know the manufacturing method of the medicine. Zheng Ziqian claimed that he was the acting manager of the Leiyu Company and that he had only been in charge of selling goods since 1930. He did not know whether the medicine contained morphine or anything else. All the smoking paraphernalia were used by his mother, who had now gone to Guangdong, so she left the smoking paraphernalia behind. The opium ash seized was used to make the medicine, etc. Finally, the defendant's lawyer, E Sen, claimed that the Public Works Department's doctor's chemical test report did not determine the amount of morphine or opium in the medicine. It only said that it was consistent with the ingredients of the medicines sold on the market. The words "indeed" in the translation were a mistake. Therefore, he requested that the court reschedule the re-testing of the medicine. Chief Judge Zhou Hanting reviewed the report and instructed each defendant to pay a deposit of 1,500 yuan in cash or property to be released pending trial. The four medicines, large and small, were handed over to the court's forensic doctor for re-examination. The case was rescheduled for trial.</p>
<h3>Refugees Return to Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Tragedy in Huangpu</h3>
<p>▲ Two Boats Collide, Three Missing Lu Boyin from Si'an has been running a jute shop in Shanghai. Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, Lu moved his family to his hometown of Si'an to take refuge. Now that the situation is calm and the market is gradually recovering, Lu returned to Shanghai on the 12th. He hired Qiu Daosheng's boat in Si'an, carrying Lu's mother, wife, children, apprentices, a total of eight people, and boxes and luggage. Lu was eager to arrive in Shanghai to do business, so he told Qiu to sail quickly so that he could arrive in Shanghai as soon as possible. The day before yesterday, Qiu's boat sailed to Tagang and stopped overnight. Yesterday morning, before dawn, Lu ordered Qiu's boat to set sail. Qiu's boat sailed to a bay at the south end of Shihetang, South Huangpu. Just then, Yang A'jin's boat from Shanghai Hengjihao, fully loaded with sundries, was speeding to the interior. Qiu's boat was unable to avoid it and was violently hit, retreating more than ten yards. The bow of the boat was knocked off, and the boat sank immediately. Lu's family and others woke up in their sleep and cried for help. The boat had already been flooded with water. Yang's boat stopped and lowered a sampan to rescue them. Lu and five of Lu's children and apprentices were rescued. Lu's mother, wife, and an apprentice were missing. Many of the boxes and luggage were lost with the boat. However, Yang's boat, although the bow was damaged, was not hindered and could still sail. Qiu is now holding Yang for negotiation. Yang refused to take responsibility, saying that Qiu's boat had strayed into the wrong waterway, causing the collision. Lu said that the bodies of his mother and wife had not been recovered, and the lost boxes contained valuable items and important account books from the shop.

<h3>To Rape a Young Woman</h3>
<p>▲Drawing His Sword to Frighten the Villagers ▲The Rapist Plans to Sell the Woman Zhang Yingdi is 17 years old and very beautiful. Since she was a child, her parents betrothed her to Zhang Wenzao of Daijia Village, Jiading, and she was immediately brought into the family as a child bride. During the recent invasion of Shanghai by the Japanese, Zhang Yingdi and others fled from the war zone and took refuge in a shelter in Xieqiao. The day before yesterday, after lunch, Yingdi had an important matter to attend to at her brother Zhang Shunchang's house in Houjia Lane, Zhabei. However, she did not know the way, so she asked her fellow villagers Wu Zhongshan and Qiu A'gen to accompany her. When they were returning after finishing their business and passing near Gonghe Road, they suddenly met Gu A'mao. Gu knew Zhongshan, so he greeted him. After exchanging pleasantries, he saw that Yingdi was young and beautiful, and a bad idea came to his mind. He falsely claimed that the outside was under special martial law and that the Japanese soldiers were very fierce. It would be difficult for them to return to the Nanshi. He thought it would be better for them to spend the night in a nearby inn to avoid danger. Wu and the others believed him and were led by Gu to the Shuanglong Inn, where two small rooms were opened. Gu only had six copper coins in his pocket, so he asked Wu to take off his shirt and pawn it for some money to pay for the room. In the evening, Yingdi slept alone in one room, and Gu, Wu, and the others slept together in the other room. In the middle of the night, Gu suddenly sneaked into Yingdi's room, climbed onto the bed, and tried to commit indecency. Yingdi woke up from her sleep and was shocked to see this. She cried out for help. Gu immediately put his hand on her throat to prevent her from shouting. At that time, Wu and the others heard the sound and gathered together. Gu suddenly pulled out a sharp blade from his side to stop them from making any noise, and said, "You guys get out of this room immediately, or I will cut off your heads." Wu and Qiu were villagers and were so frightened by the sight of the snow-white steel knife that they were numb. They reluctantly withdrew and returned to their room to sleep. Yingdi saw that there was no way to call for help and had to suffer Gu's forcible rape. After the night was over, Wu and the others still accompanied Yingdi back to the shelter. Unexpectedly, Gu followed them to the vicinity of Dadongmen, intending to take Yingdi to another port. Yingdi refused, and they quarreled on the way. They were discovered by Ma Bulong, a policeman from the Third Precinct of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who took them all to the station. During the preliminary interrogation, Yingdi and the others confessed what had happened and requested a strict investigation. Gu A'mao claimed to be 22 years old and worked as a mason, but was now unemployed. Qiu A'gen had lured Yingdi out of the shelter, and he had asked Gu to rape her in the inn to spoil her reputation and make her unable to return. He could then sell her to another port to fulfill his wishes. Now, these people suddenly accused him of forcibly raping the woman. The truth was that he was wronged, etc. As the case involved rape, he was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Woman Commits Suicide in Hotel</h3>
<p>▲Claiming to be Xu Difan, a Medical Practitioner At around 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, a female guest checked into the Lao Huizhong Hotel on Shandong Road, Ma Jiaquan. The bellboy led her to room number 12. She paid five yuan on the spot, claiming to be Xu Difan, 30 years old, and a medical practitioner. After the bellboy brought tea, she ordered him to buy some snacks to fill her stomach. After eating, she closed the door and went to sleep. Around 12 p.m. the next day, she had not yet gotten up. The bellboy knocked on the door several times, but there was no response. He then found a way to pry open the door. He saw her lying stiffly on the bed, her body as cold as ice, and she had already died. He immediately reported to the front desk and reported to the Fourth Road General Patrol Room, who ordered the police to come. They carried the body to the opposite Renji Hospital and transferred it to the coroner's office, waiting for the court to investigate.</p>
<h3>Taking Advantage of the War</h3>
<h3>To Form Another Family</h3>
<p>▲The Wife Did Not Return Home ▲The Adulterer Detained in the Police Station Sun Yucai, a native of Gaoyou, No. 65 Yangjiadu Street, Nanshi, was a worker. His wife, Sun Dai, was 29 years old. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Sun, fearing danger, ordered his wife to return home. Unexpectedly, after several months, there was no news from home. He was very surprised and immediately sent a letter to his hometown to inquire. The reply was that she had not returned home. Sun became anxious and asked people to look around. He learned that she had become intimate with Zhao Yuanshan, a waiter at the Overseas Chinese Bathhouse on Minguo Road, and had taken advantage of the war to form another family in Sande Lane, Jiu Mu Di. He went there the day before yesterday to arrest them both. However, his wife was snatched away by thugs, so he called the police and had the adulterer detained in the First Precinct of the Second District and transferred to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Doctor Extorted by Bandits</h3>
<p>▲Bandits Claim to be from the Three K Party Dr. Tang, who lives in a bungalow in Qiasheng Lane, College Road, in the city, has been doing well in his practice, which has attracted the attention of bandits. A week ago, he received five or six threatening letters, claiming to be from the Three K Party. They said that the party was short of funds and asked for a loan of 300 yuan. Later, a letter even included a bullet and reduced the amount by half, asking for only 150 yuan. They asked him to wrap the money and place it at the foot of the left wall in the lane at 3 p.m. on the 13th. After receiving the letter, Tang rushed to the nearby security corps to report. He also placed a fake package of money. At the appointed time, the team leader of the corps led several team members in disguise to ambush around the lane. At about 3:30 p.m., three people in short clothes arrived. The first person bent down to search under the left wall and was bravely apprehended by the members of the security corps, who arrested all three of them and transferred them to the Second Sub-precinct of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Under preliminary interrogation by the station chief, they confessed that the person who was searching at the wall was named Huang Xiaogou, and the other two were Huang Afu and Huang Zhiming. They said that Wang Laowu had ordered them to retrieve a letter and that they did not know they were committing a crime. Finally, they confessed that Wang Laowu was living in a certain room at the Qingyun Hotel at the intersection of Dongzilaihuo Street, Edward Road, in the French Concession. The station chief ordered several detectives to go to the French Concession police station and arrest Wang Apin, also known as Lao San. He firmly denied being Lao Wu. He was taken to the police station, and after being interrogated by the police chief, he confessed that there were four other accomplices involved in the conspiracy: Li Xiaosan, Luo Changchun, Li A'bao, and Yao Ziqing. After the interrogation, they were handed over to the original police officers and taken back to the sub-precinct, and a report was sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for punishment.</p>

<h3>Silk Shop Owner</h3>
<h3>Returns Home and Encounters Robbery</h3>
<p>▲Silk Clothes Robbed Clean ▲Bandits Deceive Him of Ten Yuan Jiading native Zhu Shilin, 43 years old, has been running a silk shop in Jiacheng. Due to the Japanese invasion, the place was devastated. Zhu stopped his business and fled with his family, taking some luggage and renting a place at No. 119 South Wuxi Road. He heard that [Jiading] was now safe. Therefore, Zhu was very anxious and wanted to return home to take a look. However, because the train was not open, he hired a boat yesterday at around 7:00 am. He carried his family and luggage, and set off to return home. Before travelling for a long time, just near Xiaoshadu, Suzhou River, in a remote area, six or seven bandits suddenly came to the shore, shouting fiercely and ordering them to stop. They jumped aboard and robbed a suitcase full of silk and clothes. The bandits carried the stolen goods ashore and rushed into a shed. Shortly afterwards, two bandits returned to the boat and told Zhu that they needed to pay 30 yuan in order to redeem the suitcase. Zhu only had ten yuan on him, so he agreed to pay all ten yuan. The two bandits took the money, went ashore with the other bandits, and disappeared with the stolen goods. Then Zhu recovered from the shock. He separately reported to the police station and the Sixth District police station.</p>

<p>Gold Price</p>
<h3>Swap Day Mediocre</h3>
<p>▲Swap Shorts Finally Post Three to Four Tael</p>
<p>Yesterday, as usual, the Gold Exchange began swapping. However, because the 16th is a Western holiday and the market will be closed, the swap was held two days early. The exchange opened at 8 AM. The short side was posting for the June-July swap, initially at four and a half to three taels. It then went to the listed price of four taels and some cents, then four taels and five or six cents. However, the longs quickly swapped, and the price dropped to within two taels, and finally three to four taels. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, all the long and short firms had practically no trading in June, and as usual, they changed to July. However, the opening price was 718.9 taels, and the noon close was 18 taels, a drop of 1.7 taels from the previous day. This was due to the July listing being transferred.</p>
<p>▲July Slightly Softer on Debut</p>
<p>The July contract debuted yesterday, trending slightly downward. The high was only two or three taels. Different firms had unequal trading and there wasn't much volume. It ultimately stood between 715 taels. Initially, the slight drop in silver prices didn't seem to affect it. However, because of the sudden convocation of the American White House for a silver conference, rumors of discussions arose, causing people to feel down, which affected the gold market. By noon, there seemed to be more buyers, and since the foreign exchange rate was neither clearly rising nor falling, it turned mild again. The market will be closed due to Saturday, and also this week's situation has been exceptionally complex. Initially, due to the swap flood, the longs were squeezed, causing the price to rise to 734.1 taels. Then, news of cooperation between Britain and the United States to alleviate the silver shortage caused a sharp decline, breaking 710 taels, and suddenly falling to 708.3 taels, a total difference of 26 taels or so. Overall, compared to last Saturday (June contract), there was a sharp drop of 10 taels. The changes were unpredictable. The details of yesterday's market are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Market Extremely Dull</p>
<p>Since opening early at 714.5 taels for the July contract, the big firms were returning a quarter. The silver price was only calculated at one-eighth, and private telegrams did not update, so it opened lower. However, Zhi Feng, Yong Qian Chang, Xiang Yuan Kang, and Xiang, etc., bought in, presumably at 17 taels. Yuan Chun, Hong Kang, Yong Heng, Yu, etc., sold, and it dropped to 13.2 taels. With the foreign exchange rate stabilizing, HSBC first absorbed US$31.5625 for September delivery, and Yuan Heng, Yuan Mao, Yong Shun Li, Bing Xing, etc., bought in, jumping 3 taels. By 9:30 AM it was 16.5 taels. Unexpectedly, British and American exchanges were back to 625, and it immediately dropped to 15 taels. Upon hearing rumors of the silver conference being brought up again, Da Xing, Yong, etc., sold off, and it continued to fall by 3 taels. Around 10 AM it was 12 taels. Afterwards, it slightly rebounded, calculated at 13.89 taels, but there was little trading. Da De Cheng, Wu Pin, Ying Feng Heng, etc., bought in, while small firms, etc., sold out. From 10 AM to 10:45 AM, it fluctuated by a few cents or a tael. Later, because US$5625 for August delivery could be settled, and Ri Chang, Xie Xing, Yong Hong Kang Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, etc., were all selling off, the price depreciated again by 2 taels. At 11:10 AM it was only 11.5 taels. Suddenly, it was heard that HSBC was absorbing US dollars for future delivery at 625, and Yuan Heng, Ri Chang, Wu Pin, and foreign exchange hedgers bought in, instantly rising 3 taels. At 11:30 AM it was 14.8 taels. Because small speculators were selling out, it retreated to 13.2 taels. However, material hedgers and Dalian firms were dragging it in, thereby raising the price by 2 taels. By the noon close it was 15 taels, a drop of about 1.67 taels compared to the previous day, excluding the swap. The largest fluctuation in half a day was 17 taels, the smallest was 11.5 taels, with a range of 5.5 taels. The posted price was changed to 787 taels, a reduction of 72-73 taels to 75 taels, then back to 72 taels. The booked amount for May and June was 18 taels, 15 taels for July, supplementary water was 18 taels, and the red line increased by 8.5 taels.</p>
<p>▲Not Much Trading Among Firms</p>
<p>According to surface trading statistics, Yuan Heng, Da De Cheng, Qian Chang Xiang, Shun Li, Wan Xing, and Yuan Kang Xiang were all buying in. Fu Tai Heng, Ri Chang, and Yu He sold out and then bought in. Yuan Mao Yong, Hong Kang Yong, Yuan Chun, and Yi Feng Yong all sold out. Yuan Tai, Heng Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, etc., seemed to be active, buying and selling. However, hedging firms only bought in a small amount.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market Clearly Loose, Secretly Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market suddenly fell, reversing the five-day upward trend, while the exchange rate continued to decline slightly. The HSBC listing trend was quite different, showing an inverse proportion. It was raised by one level, which is the rate system for British-American exchange. The British gold was calculated at 25, which is one shilling and eight pence; the US dollar was only 25, calculated at 30.5 yuan; Hong Kong remained at 77 taels; the Indian exchange rate added 1.5 yuan; the French franc added 5 yuan; the German exchange rate added 1 yuan; the Japanese yen added half a shield; the Singapore dollar decreased by 1.75 taels. As for the domestic market, the British and American exchanges were initially flat and then seemed loose, but there was no special change, and the fluctuations were very small. Because the gold market had opened swapping, and the price was slightly lower, it was affected by the renewed discussion of the silver conference. By noon, the close was unchanged from the previous day, truly an image of obvious looseness but secret flatness. There was limited trading among banks. The British gold was particularly low, and the US dollar was no more than 2-300,000 yuan, all sold by the gold firms. As for the set-off strips, because there was no market yesterday afternoon due to Saturday, and next Monday is the Western Pentecost, all banks will be closed for one day as usual.</p>
<p>▲British Exchange Internal Market Only Fluctuated by 0625 in Half a Day</p>
<p>From the early market selling price of one shilling, eight pence and thirteen one-two-fifths to three-seventy-fifths, the buying price was three-seventy-fifths to four-thirty-seven-fifths. Hua Bi absorbed half a penny for July, and the noon close was flat.</p>
<p>▲American Exchange Internal Market Only Had a 125 Difference</p>
<p>Near tight and far loose. This month and August-September are actually half a yuan apart. From the early market selling price of 30.09375 yuan this month, 31 yuan for June, 31.1875 yuan for July, and 31.4375 yuan for August-September, the buying price was 31.0625 to 5625 yuan. HSBC entered 5625 for September, Zhong Fa entered 31 yuan this month, Pan Gen entered 5625 for August, Sumitomo entered the same price for September, and Shanghai Zhong Fu did the same price for August. HSBC absorbed 625 for September. The noon close for this month was still 30.9375 yuan. The other month's entry and exit prices were also no different from the early opening. The market situation was particularly peaceful. The listed price was one yuan equal to 3.27869 taels of silver.</p>
<h3>Large Bar Long Zero Six Two Five</h3>
<p>国民社 Fourteenth, London cable, near far big bars long zero six two five, calculate recent term is seventeen pence one eight seven five, distant term is seventeen pence three one two five, London to New York exchange price, open three yuan six jiao five cents all weakened momentum.</p>
<h3>▲Collection Solution Rarely Belongs to Weekend Example</h3>
<p>▲Market Overview Yesterday, the foreign market heard that silkworm cocoons were used, and the situation was slightly sharp. However, the silver dismantling was very loose and still trending down. In the afternoon market, it was suddenly heard that the buying momentum had stopped, causing people's hearts to show fatigue again, so it was still seen to fall. As for the collection and solution situation, since banks are only open for half a day on weekends as usual, the overall trend is very rare.</p>
<p>▲Price of Li Chai (Foreign Li) The Li price in the morning market was still the same as the previous noon, at seven qian zero three li. The noon market fell half a li, to seven qian zero two and a half li. The overall trend was very soft.

<p>▲Auxiliary Coin Market Conditions</p>
<p>Jiangnan small foreign coins fell sharply by three li from the previous noon, to six qian one fen. Because there were few transactions in the morning market, no one competed for prices, so it remained the same. Transactions were 4,500 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were six qian zero two and a half li in the early market and six qian zero two li in the noon market, a drop of half a li.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>▲Transactions Only Exceeding One Million</p>
<p>Yesterday (14th), the conditions of various bond markets in the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange showed scarce spot entry and exit, totaling 9,000 yuan. The futures market was also unusually deserted, and the market's morale was low. It is estimated that over 400,000 were opened in the morning, and only over 600,000 were opened in the afternoon. The total salt tax was about 200,000 yuan, and the others were only around 100,000 yuan. In terms of trends, the environment was also dull. There was no new development in the domestic situation and diplomatic situation, so the market became more quiet. Large investors had no transactions, and the attitude of small investors was also particularly indifferent. The demand and supply momentum was flat, and the stagnant situation of each price was added to the before and after market with only one or two corners of hovering. Although it fell slightly compared to the previous day, the number was only around two or three corners.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Deteriorating</h3>
<p>▲American East Silver Company Report</p>
<p>Friday, the New York stock market continued to show weakness. The outlook for railway stocks was bleak, and sales were constant throughout the day. Although the selling pressure in the market was not very strong, the decline in various representative stocks was very large. According to the Dow Jones Daily Index, industrial stocks fell 2.16 pounds. Among them, only copper, oil, and automobile stocks were more stable. Railway stocks continued to fall 1.10 pounds, to 18.17. Among them, Union Pacific Railroad fell 3.125, to 45.375. New York Central Railroad continued to fall 0.75. At present, the public is confused, and it is difficult to reverse the decline without a definite change in politics. The current stock prices have reached the lowest price in 1915, but it is still doubtful whether they will continue to fall after that.</p>

<h3>Yarn Market Has Some Floating Long Liquidation</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market showed a slight decline, and the decline started again. In fact, due to the continuous rise in recent days, the current yarn sales have slightly stopped, and the public's morale has turned weak, and the rebound has suddenly risen. Moreover, the general floating longs have seen the situation as flat and have liquidated actively, so the market has fallen. However, the factories have sold half of their current yarn this time, and they are much more relaxed. Their thinking is not as empty as it was the day before. For the price of 55 taels of standard yarn, it may temporarily hover for a while, but the raw materials are very cheap, and the fundamentals are cheap, so there is still a strong desire to sell. The future situation will still be based on actual needs. Moreover, the various gangs have bought a lot recently, so a temporary pause is also expected.</p>
<p>▲Man-Made Standard Slightly Declines by Two or So</p>
<p>The market opened with foreign cotton being flat and tired. The current sales of various gangs have shown signs of fullness, and the tone has changed to tired. The situation has loosened, and some long positions have been liquidated, falling by five, six, and seven cents. In the afternoon, the tired state remained the same. There were not many buyers in the market. The prices in each month fell by three, four, and five cents. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 9,550 bales of Xiang sold by Yi Chang 300 bales, Chang Ji 250 bales, Tian Long 300 bales, Mei Ji 200 bales, Yu Da 350 bales, Da Feng 350 bales, Rong Xing 300 bales, Yi Da 650 bales, and Da Chang Cheng 500 bales. Geng Feng bought 200 bales, Tong Yu 200 bales, Yuan Tai 300 bales, Chang Feng 1,650 bales, Xin Cheng 250 bales, and Xie Sheng 200 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous day, the number of man-made standard closing positions was: September 1555 fell 1122, 4007 month period 1553 fell 1014, 350 October 1557924, 850 August period 1552 921, 750 total... 83,250</p>
<p>▲Current Sales Decreased Compared to Yesterday</p>
<p>The sales of current yarn were less than yesterday. It was found that the various gangs bought a total of 2,325 bales for the whole day, and more than 1,000 bales were opened yesterday and merged into today. Customer gangs: Guangdong entered 530 bales, Mainland entered 90 bales, Sichuan entered 850 bales, Shantou entered 515 bales, Jiangxi entered 65 bales, North Gang entered 10 bales, Ningbo entered 50 bales, Changsha entered 160 bales, Fujian entered 10 bales, Wenzhou entered 50 bales, and colleagues entered 35 bales. The market is trending weak.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Falls</p>
<h3>▲American Flower Has A Large Batch Opening</h3>
<p>The cotton market trend is weak, and the decline wind is stronger. The reason is that American cotton is flat and soft, and some foreign firms are peddling in the market and are eager to find a way out. The prices are very accommodating. It is heard that Shenxin has purchased a large amount of American flower again, and the market price is quite cheap, which makes people feel greatly panicked. Some cotton merchants are selling off standard cotton, and the market is falling further.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Standard Falls Four or Five Cents</p>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng Standard front market, because the price of gold fell again and foreign cotton was flat, the buying momentum in the market was not strong, and the prices in each month fell to the three-two-point barrier, falling by two and a half cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that a large number of American flowers were being opened in the market, and Xincheng was selling heavily, and the market situation was even weaker, falling by two and a half cents. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 15,200 dans. It was found that Xincheng sold 2,100 dans, Changfeng 1,600 dans, Tongxing 500 dans, Gengfeng 900 dans, Dafeng 400 dans, Jifeng 300 dans, and Changhe 400 dans. Changfeng bought 800 dans, Ruiyuan 400 dans, Yuanda 700 dans, Yi Chang 600 dans, Shenji 700 dans, Ruida 600 dans, and Mingde 400 dans, Dafu 200 dans. The closing prices are listed below. Compared to the previous day, the number of Zheng Standard closing positions was: October 3275 fell 3561, 3007 month 3265 fell 5039, 200 Total 157,5008 month 32754057, 000</p>
<p>▲Raw Cotton Factory Appetite Not Bad</p>
<p>The current cotton business is still good, and the factories all have appetite. It is heard that Shenxin purchased American cotton for a price of 29 taels. This telegram has not yet returned to Shanghai, so a compromise has not been reached. The opening prices are recorded on the left: Lingbao Flower 34.50, Shenxin Factory entered 200 pieces of spot goods to the factory. Also 36.25, Sulun Factory entered 180 pieces. Also, Ong Mola 30.35, Chongxin Factory entered 500 pieces immediately. Also 30.50, Dafeng Factory entered 1,000 pieces. Also, also.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Lackluster</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was lackluster, and industry peers were in a wait-and-see mode. Futures prices fell by one to two points, spot prices fell by five points. British cotton futures fell by three to four points, and spot prices fell by three points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton opened higher due to positive news from Liverpool. 平果爾 fell by 2.5 rupees, and 白羅溪 fell by 2.25 rupees. The original telegraphic record on the left (dated the 13th):</p>

<h3>Tianjin West River Cotton Flower Prices Trending Down</h3>
<p>The Tianjin West River Cotton Flower market is sluggish. Recently, Donghui has fallen. Japanese merchants have already taken in goods, but the delivery procedures are not yet complete. The market atmosphere has suddenly turned bleak and shows a precarious downward trend. Qingxi Bank bought 290 packages, with an asking price of 27 taels and 3 qian, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Yarn Market Dull</h3>
<p>The situation in the Tianjin yarn market: Japanese yarn sales are relatively active, but transactions are still stalled. Xianghe merchants bought 16-count Sunlight yarn and 20-count Hongxi yarn, with asking prices of 150 taels each, for delivery in June and July. Gaoyang merchants bought 20-count Lanfeng yarn with an asking price of 153 taels, it is said.</p>

<h3>Wenzhou Green Tea Has Opened</h3>
<p>▲Higher by 20 Taels Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of this port, Wenzhou "Zhen Mei" and "Zhen Mei" needle-shaped green teas from Lailu Tea Firm were officially opened by Jinlong Trading Company. The price of "Zhen Mei" was opened at 80 taels, higher by 20 taels compared to last year, and the price of needle-shaped was opened at 50 taels, higher by 10 taels compared to last year. As for the local "Zhen Mei", transactions were sparse, and the price recognition by traders was as strict as yesterday. Whether the market can develop depends on the French telegram returning to Shanghai next week, which can also be used as a determination, it is said.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Qimen Black Tea Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiang'an steamship imported more than 1,800 boxes of Qimen black tea. It is heard that there are still more than 4,000 boxes arriving in Shanghai today. It is expected that tomorrow, there will be a huge amount of 6,000 to 7,000 boxes of Qimen tea on the market, which will be a grand occasion, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tea News from Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, and Supplementary Notes</h3>
<p>▲New Tea from Southern Zhejiang Is Being Harvested Immediately</p>
<p>Since the opening of the tea season in Wuyi County, there have only been two or three days of sunny weather, and the rest have been heavy rain and hail, which is unfavorable for picking and processing. The daily picking is reduced by half compared to sunny days, and the tea leaves are heavily soaked by rain, making them hard and not soft, and the kneading and frying process is very labor-intensive. Fortunately, the weather is still cold, and the tea buds are not growing too fast, so they will not become old leaves.</p>
<p>Due to the invasion of the Gan bandits, the new tea in various villages in southern Zhejiang could not be picked and processed. The red bandits who had gathered and fled to Dexing boundary the day before yesterday (the 5th) were urgently pursued, besieged, and defeated by the Jiangxi Provincial Security Regiment, and the situation has eased. Mountain households are taking advantage of this to open their gardens and rush to pick tea, ensuring the livelihood of poor households.</p>
<p>▲New Tea in She County Is Half Harvested and Processed</p>
<p>New green tea from the most famous Jieyuan, Dafang, and Huangshan areas of She County has been harvested and processed by mountain households one week before the Start of Summer to increase the market price of tender buds. However, due to the cold spring and frequent rains, the shipment is slow. The tea produced by each household is about half of the total production. In recent days, the weather has not warmed up, and heavy rains have poured down, which is not conducive to picking and processing. Mountain households have temporarily stopped picking because the mountain tea is still tender. Tea shops in this county are busy transporting goods to foreign countries and opening scales early because the new tea is about to be launched on the market.</p>
<p>▲New Tea in Xiaoshan Is Slow-Moving in Foreign Trading Companies</p>
<p>Jiangtang, Shiliwang, Mashe, Shanxi Yue, and other places at the junction of Xiaoshan and Shaoxing are all tea-producing areas in Zhejiang Province. This year, due to the severe cold in spring, the tea trees in this county budded later, so there was not much new tea before the Rain. Last week, the weather turned warmer, and the first tea was harvested and processed. However, the harvest was not good. Although the selling price of green tea was opened to 120 yuan, the local tea shops in Zhabei, Shanghai, were destroyed by artillery fire, and fewer people opened shops than in previous years. There are few people who come to Xiaoshan to buy tea, so the tea produced by each household is still mostly hoarded and unsold, and the market situation is very sluggish.</p>
<p>▲Weiping Green Tea Has Opened</p>
<p>Weiping in Zhejiang is also a tea-producing area. The annual production and sales of foreign trading companies are no less than tens of thousands of boxes. Since the start of harvesting at the Start of Summer, it is now coming to an end. According to a letter from the area yesterday, the new goods have been officially opened, and the price per dan is 64 yuan, which is 14 to 15 yuan higher than last year. The production in various places has not increased or decreased compared to last year, it is said.</p>
<p>▲Anren and Yugan Tea Suffers from Banditry and Arrears</p>
<p>Anren and Yugan are also tea-rich areas in Jiangxi Province. The tea leaves produced in Yugan, which borders Anren, are inferior in color and taste to An tea, and the price is also cheaper. Most of the annual production is supplied to shops and trading companies, and foreign trading companies rarely purchase it. An tea leaves are tender and can be supplied to foreign trading companies for the production of fine goods. Wuyuan Southwest and Deyi Tea Company used to purchase here. In recent years, Anren and Yugan counties have suffered repeated bandit disasters, and most of the tea trees have been abandoned. Although the new tea in the two places is now suitable for harvesting and processing, farmers are uneasy about farming, fleeing to avoid disasters, and the number of people picking and processing tea leaves in various villages is less than three-tenths of what it used to be, and most of them are extremely poor mountain households who occasionally pick and dry tea to support their lives, and there is almost no tea market to speak of.</p>
<h3>Shandong Factory Silk Firm Despite Lack of Price</h3>
<p>▲Silk Merchants Insist on Not Selling at Reduced Prices, Market Atmosphere Is Strained</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market of this port still lacked progress. It was found that the losses in Europe and the United States were due to the relatively high cost of raw silk, and the losses were still huge, making it difficult to sell. The interest of American companies in purchasing was also weak. The inventory of Shandong Yellow Factory Silk was scarce, and Shandong silk merchants insisted on not selling at low prices. European companies hoped to reduce prices, and the market atmosphere was strained. Yesterday, only Hangzhou silk merchants purchased 10 packages of Shanghai White Factory Silk from Middle Grade Top Grade 18 to 22 strands at the price of 580 taels. Xin Shichang purchased 5 packages of Jinniao Brand Top Grade White Dry Silk at the price of 650 taels. Kechang purchased 3 packages of Heji Top Grade Over-Basin Yellow Silk at the price of 320 taels. Efforts were made to promote the sale of old silk.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Silk Inventory in Shanghai Warehouses</h3>
<p>▲Total Silk Inventory, Including Old Cocoons, Reaches More Than 40,000 Bales</p>
<p>New cocoons from the mainland will be launched on the market in a blink of an eye, while the number of old silk and old cocoons that are slow-moving in Shanghai is very large. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry have agreed with the leaders of silk and cocoon merchants and the financial community (because old silk and cocoons have been mortgaged to the financial community) on a plan to promote sales. It is found that the old factory silk accumulated in Shanghai warehouses over the years totals more than 20,000 bales, and 100,000 dan of old dried cocoons, which can be converted into 20,000 bales of factory silk based on a reeling conversion rate of 500 catties. Therefore, the total old silk inventory reaches more than 40,000 bales. Overseas silk sales are increasingly sluggish, and there is currently no possibility of dumping, it is said.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Markets Tightening</h3>
<p>▲Yesterday morning in southern Shanghai, due to unfavorable weather, fewer rice boats from the western routes arrived than on the 20th. The inventory in the port is gradually decreasing, and sales in urban and rural stores are not smooth. In addition, it is the end of the lunar month, and firms on both sides are closing their accounts, so the market situation is in a slump. The opening price of Changzhou and Xixi North Japonica rice is fixed. There is not much early rice, late rice, and Feilaifeng in stock. The appetite for Ningbo rice is turning active, although retail sales are limited, and prices are rising sharply. The supply of goods from Suzhou and Tongli is becoming scarce, and the market in this street is moving but not brisk, but prices have risen slightly by one or two jiao.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday in the northern market, there were more retail sales and fewer wholesale sales. The opening price in the morning fluctuated by nearly one jiao, and it turned weak in the afternoon. The price of top-quality Changzhou and Xixi rice was similar to before, and the price of Zhongguan rice rose by one or two jiao. Early rice and late rice were still stable. The price of sharp-edged rice from Lupu was firm, with a price increase of five fen to one jiao. The sources from the mainland include Wuxi, Liyang, Kunshan, Jiangyin, Suzhou, Tongli, Qingpu, Chonggu, Songjiang, and other fifteen or six markets, with a total of about 5,000 dan of river factory rice.</p>
<h3>Continued Dumping of Foreign Rice in Recent Times</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice turned active. Because the appetite of mainland traders turned greedy, traders from Changzhou and Wuxi came to the market to purchase. This street also inquired about prices following the market, and the market immediately appeared tighter. However, because the inventory in recent days is sufficient, the supply continues, and foreign firms still have surplus to dump, it is difficult to expect the market price to rise in steps for a while. Yesterday, new transactions continued. Hongxing, on behalf of Yuanxing Foreign Firm, dumped 3,500 bags of Mindang rice for delivery in three weeks at a price of 10 yuan, 0 jiao and 7 fen. 2,000 bags of Jia Ladi for delivery in two weeks at a price of 9 yuan and 7 jiao. 150 tons of Xiaojiao reclaimed goods in May at a price of 5 taels and 4 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen, all were handled by this street. Spot transactions included 7,000 bags of Xiaojiao at a price of 10 yuan, 0 jiao and 6 fen and 8 fen, down to 3 jiao and 2 fen, and 2,000 bags of Mindang rice at a price of 10 yuan, 0 jiao and 9 fen and 8 fen, down to 0 jiao and 8 fen, which were distributed to mainland traders and traders from this street.</p>
<h3>Improved Sales of Flour in the North</h3>
<p>▲30,000 Bags Handled Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market situation: foreign market prices were reported to be up by a large jiao, and people's hearts turned slightly better. However, when the price was opened, due to many competitors selling back, the Bingchuan brand for this month only opened at 2 taels, 0 jiao and 1 fen and a half, and 1 fen and 75. Although the old Che brand had real consumption in this street, it only opened at 2 taels, 0 jiao and 2 fen and a half. Later, Shandong and scattered traders from the north inquired and handled 30,000 bags of spot flour of various brands, and the market situation immediately improved. The Bingchuan brand for this month was up to 2 taels, 0 jiao and 3 fen, the old Che brand was 2 taels, 0 jiao and 3 fen and a half, and the price for June opened at 2 taels, 0 jiao and 6 fen and a half, and there were 3,000 bags of counterpart transactions, it is said.</p>
<h3>Factory Cloth Fell More Than Rose</h3>
<p>Abundant Inventory in the Western Goods Market</p>
<p>After a period of slight activity in fabric transactions, it became flat again. The reason is that there are few days left until the end of May, and the capital of the traders is exhausted, so they all dare not purchase too much. Yesterday, the appetite from Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, and other places was smoother, and the rest were all watching. Prices fell more than rose. Lightweight cloth rose and then softened. 16-pound and 13-pound coarse cloth have a great tendency to gradually decline, and fine twill is even more in a slump. Although the trend of fine cloth is soft, customer sales are still active, with 100 pieces leaving the market every day, which is due to the sales order. The trend of coarse twill is originally weak, and coupled with the unstable situation in recent years, traders from Shaanxi, Gansu, and other places have never purchased in wholesale, so the output is quite small, and the market has no major fluctuations. Under the internal and external pressure, the sales of Western goods are sluggish, which is the highest in recent years, but the supply is still endless. Therefore, products such as Fuchou, white striped muslin, and Yuanyu Fuchou are all flooded in the market. Among them, it is said that the sales of striped Fuchou alone will take three years to sell out. In addition, Eastern goods are also active in recent days, with goods made of yarn and thread selling for only 2 jiao and 5-6 fen, so the sales channels of the shops in this street have been encroached upon. Bleached cloth is also affected by this, so the unfavorable environment is indeed rare in recent years, it is said.</p>
<h3>White Lead Sheet Market Conditions Changed</h3>
<p>Number 2 white lead sheet is a necessary item for tea traders, so in the previous months, sales were booming. Recently, however, the market conditions have changed. The new tea has already entered the market, and the tea traders no longer need to purchase it. In addition, the export business has not seen any progress, and the market situation is extremely cold. As a result, the standard has fallen sharply. The current market price is 22 taels and 5 qian per dan, which is a drop of about 2 taels compared to before. However, the bottom goods are full, and it is not easy to sell them for a while, so those who are engaged in this business are extremely terrified. Therefore, the standard in the later market may fall again, it is said.</p>
<h3>Coal - Kailuan Coal Sales Turn Better</h3>
<p>Recently, the coal market in this port has gradually shown improvement. The market is busy with transactions, and the sales of various Kailuan coals are particularly active. In the past two days, the spot transactions reached more than 5,000 tons, most of which were purchased by factories inside the port. Local traders and shops also purchased a lot. The market price is stable. The price of special fine coal is 10 taels, 0 qian and 2 fen and a half per ton, Number 1 fine coal is 9 taels, Number 2 fine coal is 8 taels and 4 qian, and Kailuan lump coal is 9 taels and 5 qian, it is said.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On the Irish Free State (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Kai Xu</p>
<p>Then, two beautiful, naturally talented young women were selected from the Buddhist party. They were both university graduates and resourceful women. So these two women were disguised as country girls, as relatives of fake farmers, and lived together in the countryside. During their leisure time, they took walks in the fields, so they became close to the prison guards. As time went on, they became more familiar with them and even held hands and went on游玩 together, completely forgetting their duties. The date of Fuller's release from prison was set for the afternoon of February 3, 1919. According to prison regulations, prisoners should enter the prison courtyard on that day and do three hours of exercise. Exercise time was from 4 pm to 7 pm. At about 5 pm, the two young women came near the prison. The prison guards greeted them with joy. So they all laughed and joked, or deliberately flirted and whispered sweet words. These prison guards were so fascinated by the beauty that they each led their loved ones to wander in the fields. Unintentionally, they were already far away from the prison. The remaining number of farmers cut off the barbed wire at this precious moment. They opened the back door of the prison with a fake key, led Mr. Fuller out, and six pre-ambushed cars took Mr. Fuller away quickly. The other five created a false front in the rear to prevent them from getting the Fuller car. This is the romantic story of Mr. Fuller's prison break. Mr. Fuller first went to London from prison and then disguised himself as a coolie and crossed the West to the United States. The following year, the British government divided the 26 counties of Ireland to establish the Irish Free State. In 1921, the Irish Free State Treaty was signed between Britain and Ireland. Mr. Fuller had previously said that once the Free State Treaty was concluded, there would be bloodshed in Ireland. Therefore, in June 1922, the Irish Volunteers launched an army to attack the Free State army. It was like the rise of our Northeast Volunteers to fight against the puppet government army. (But is the army of the Irish Free State like the army of the Manchurian puppet state that is incited by the Japanese to bark at its master?) The battle took place in (Dublin), and half of the famous district was reduced to ashes. In the year after that, riots followed one after another, and deaths were numerous. Assassins looked at each other on the road. The deaths of the leaders of the Free State cannot be counted. Mr. Fuller was deeply hidden in the valley at this time. All orders were issued through dozens of people, and even his subordinates could not know Mr. Fuller's whereabouts. Therefore, the Free State authorities had no way to capture him. By January 1923, the party in the Free State prison had exceeded 10,000 people. Mr. Fuller believed that the chaos was causing suffering to the people, so he summoned his subordinates and taught them to give up the struggle. This is the origin of peace in the past ten years. However, now that Mr. Fuller has come out again, can he be like those in our country who advocate democracy and once they enter the central government, they can be as complacent as a king sitting in the south?</p>

<h3>Random Notes on Xuanwu Lake in Early Summer</h3>
<p>— Zhen Xiang</p>
<p>Cherries are red and ripe, and orioles are singing sweetly. This is the time when gentlemen and ladies gather on the shores of Xuanwu Lake. In recent years, Xuanwu Lake has been carefully managed by the Beijing Municipal Government, making use of its natural terrain and carefully arranging it. The lakeside road has been widened and is now twice as wide as before. The Five Continents Park is bathed in European-style beauty, with green grass and colorful flowers like ribbons. Backed by mountains and facing the lake, the scenery is particularly pleasant. Therefore, the tourists of Qinhuai and Mochou are now attracted by Xuanwu Lake. It is not only the attraction of cherries.</p>
<p>The market price of cherries is not only different in the morning and evening, but also varies from person to person. Often, those who are well-dressed and accompanied by female companions who want to buy cherries are more expensive than others. Usually, we can get one catty for three jiao of洋元 when they first come on the market, but at the most expensive time, we can't get three catties even for one yuan. At the same time, the change in boat price also seems to change along with the price of cherries. When cherries are sold at the highest price, boatmen also ask for very high prices. On the contrary, when cherries are cheap, boatmen will not hoard them. Normally, a big circle around the lake costs only four jiao for a boat carrying five or six people. When it is expensive, you can't get a small boat even if you spend a lot of money.</p>
<p>People from the north of the city who visit the lake used to go directly from Taicheng, which was quite convenient by walking. Now, due to the current situation, traffic on Taicheng has been cut off, and tourists have to detour, which is very painful. It is said that the authorities will remove the obstacles soon to facilitate tourists, but it is still unknown whether this can become a reality.</p>
<p>A few days ago, General Cai Tingkai came to Beijing and made a special trip to visit the lake. A primary school student saw him from a distance and said, "Isn't that General Cai Tingkai?" The general smiled at him. So tourists who heard that the general had arrived all rushed to see the heroic face of the anti-Japanese general.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The government is touting (long-term resistance), but in fact it is (never resisting), so the people of the country cannot forgive the government's crime of losing power and land. We can prove how great the authority of armed resistance is by taking Russia as an example! After the Eastern Province Incident, Russia rushed to build fortresses in Vladivostok and other places, and deployed naval, land, and air force positions, as if (a storm is about to break), no matter how violent Japan is, it would not dare to cross the Lei pool; on the contrary, it repeatedly expressed concessions and wanted to seek its understanding, even the United States advocated the need for the United States and Russia to resume diplomatic relations. Russia is preparing (resistance), while Japan is softening; China is retreating step by step, while Japan is gaining more and more. The authorities misunderstood (yielding for the country) and repeatedly made big mistakes, leaving shame for generations! Now that Yuguan is in a state of emergency, only the volunteers are going to fight desperately. Whether the government is (resisting) or not, no one knows, but whether the current government is (saving the country) or (selling the country) depends on this final test.</p>
<h3>Where to Start</h3>
<p>— Sun Guliang</p>
<p>Jiang Mingji has been sentenced to death and executed by firing squad after being tried by a special court organized by the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs for organizing some Southeast Self-Defense Army. (See yesterday's Reuters dispatch in this newspaper) We certainly have nothing to say about this kind of dangerous element who attempts to take advantage of the fire and rob and plot wrongdoing, and we are willing to hear more about it. However, Wang Geng, who once made a lot of noise and implemented the new dedication of maps, seems to have been forgotten by the general public after being arrested and taken to Beijing because (the case is serious)! At that time, we also heard that some kind of court was going to be organized to try him, but nothing has been judged out so far. According to a paranoid friend, (this Mr. Wang has nothing to fear, and being arrested and taken to Beijing actually provides him with more protection. This life of his will definitely be continued, and nothing bad will happen!) Of course, we don't know what this is all about, but we intuitively feel that there is indeed luck and misfortune in the world. Thinking about it carefully, a strange feeling arises, and I feel that in this era, I really don't know where to start!</p>
<h3>Extracting Sugar from Wood</h3>
<p>— Jia Xuan</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the sugar we eat now is made from sugarcane or turnips, but we have never heard that sugar can be extracted from wood. But we don't need to be surprised. Haven't we become accustomed to all kinds of things that our ancestors considered impossible hundreds of years ago? Extracting sugar from wood may become a very common thing in the near future because it has now been successful in the laboratory and the cost is low, so this method of making sugar is bound to be commercially viable!</p>
<p>Extracting sugar from wood is achieved by using a chemical reaction, | chemically known as (hydrolysis) |. Because we now know that cellulose in wood, if affected by acid, can combine with water to form sugar and other substances. This method of extracting sugar is also very simple: use a barrel and fill it with extremely fine sawdust, then steam the sawdust for about an hour; at the same time, take a dilute sulfuric acid solution (the concentration is one to two parts per thousand, that is, in one thousand parts of dilute sulfuric acid, only one or two parts are pure sulfuric acid, and the rest are clean water.) Heat it to 80 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and then pass the hot solution into the bottom of the sawdust barrel and into the barrel, and then flow out from the top of the barrel. The liquid flowing out in this way contains about 2.5 to 3% sugar. Before this sugary liquid reaches the storage tank, it has to pass through a bone ash-filled barrel so that the hydrolysis reaction in the liquid can be fully utilized.</p>
<p>Using this method of making sugar, 30 to 40% of sugar can be obtained from every 100% of sawdust. In the manufacturing process, the consumption of sulfuric acid accounts for approximately 6% of the amount of sugar obtained.</p>
<h3>Lament</h3>
<p>— Bei Jiu</p>
<p>Having experienced the danger of bombing, witnessing the horror of gunfire, unable to return home, people are displaced, wandering alone on the banks of the Chun Shen River, looking up at the sky and lamenting:</p>
<p>Heavens! I am innocent, right? I am confident that I treat people with kindness. I am confident that I hold things with respect. I express my heart to the country, and contribute a little to the society; however, the happy family has opened up残痕, the happy environment is full of狰狞; the beautiful rivers and mountains leave behind ashes and smoke, and the hometown customs</p>
<h3>Parents in National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Chen Rumin</p>
<p>Children, this is originally an endearing term. If the world were to lose children, it would be filled with dryness and devoid of vitality. If a family lacks children, it is like the wellspring of happiness has dried up! We believe in what Ms. Ellen Key said: (The 20th century is the century of the child.) But the world of children needs child-like parents to educate them! It's like a gardener irrigating an unopened red rosebud. Abundant fragrance and intoxicating color require strong assistance to release its fragrance and color. In the past, Chinese children were despised by their parents. They became the private property of the wealthy and the slaves of the poor. Their nature, freedom, and happiness were all blocked and submerged by their parents! This is truly a huge loss, affecting our entire China. Alas! Now is the time to rein in at the cliff's edge. National crisis has arrived, and enemy soldiers are still firing cannons within our borders. In this difficult environment, how should parents shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and guide their children onto the path of national salvation? Come! Here are three specific methods to tell you: (1) Create an anti-Japanese family environment: We must give children a deep impression of their enemies. (2) Tell stories of revolutionary heroes: Revolutionize children's thinking and create in them the habit of acting bravely for righteousness. (3) Visit battlefields trampled by the enemy: Take your children, both boys and girls, to Wusong to see the traces of the enemy's brutality, and it will arouse a strong reaction. Chinese children are the children with the greatest responsibility in the world. Let's not underestimate them. We must raise the banner of children saving the country, clear the obstacles ahead, and raise torches to illuminate the future, allowing our children to embark on the path of national salvation. The devastation of sharp swords and dense forests means there is no home to return to! Recalling the spring breeze with hesitation, oh heavens! Please show me the lost path, please count my sins. Oh heavens! Why are you so unkind? Worthless men mislead the country, bandits run rampant, those who hold office without doing their jobs fill the court, they do not care about the suffering of the common people, and are deaf to the enemy's attack on the gate! Alas, the common people, working diligently, now follow each other to the Yellow Springs, and in the Halls of Hell, injustices cannot be redressed. Oh heavens! Why are you so unkind? Oh heavens! You have heard of prolonged resistance, you have seen the spirit of resistance, but the peace agreement has been signed and completed. Where is the price of 400 million people? What is the value of heroes' hot blood? Alas! They die as ghosts with grievances, and live as trampled people, full of sorrow and indignation, with a heart full of sincerity. To whom can they appeal? Who will appreciate their true sincerity? Oh heavens! Only you can hear my lyre and crying, a moan without illness.</p>
<h3>A Record of Military Life in Twin Buildings (52)</h3>
<p>— Owner of Qiuxingfu Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Visiting the powerful often makes generals fall, hidden imprisonment in the prison of love allows jailers to become husbands.</p>
<p>The two orderlies were just about to step forward and ask. Suddenly, another person in the gatehouse, having heard the car horn outside, lifted the curtain and glanced out the window. He rushed out to greet the female visitor with a smile, calling out, "Miss Eight. We received your call earlier. Madam Five is waiting for you. Please come in. Go to Madam Five's room and sit down." The female visitor glanced with her beautiful eyes. Seeing the person greeting her, he was fair and handsome, with a slender figure. He wore a well-tailored new khaki military uniform, with an armed belt fastened. He wore a small automatic pistol in a leather holster, without a wooden box. He wore a pair of yellow long boots with spur wheels on the heels. On his shoulders hung small shoulder boards indicating the rank of captain. He looked just like the most handsome young military officer. At first glance, she almost didn't recognize him. Only after a closer look did she smile and nod, saying, "Hey, Deshun. You've really gotten ahead." The one called Deshun blushed slightly and replied sheepishly, "It's nothing. Isn't this Madam Five's special cultivation of me?" So, with questions and answers, they laughed and chatted as they led the female visitor all the way inside. The two orderlies heard clearly, and faced each other, making funny faces, saying, "So she's looking for Madam Five. No wonder that kid waited so intently at the gate. It's none of our business." Having said that, more guests arrived outside the gate. They directed some of the unfamiliar ones to the registry at the second gate. Some of the regular acquaintances would go to the registry on their own without being directed. Then, the registry would consider the order of arrival and divide them into batches, one or several at a time. An officer with the rank of major, holding the visiting cards, would lead them to the reception hall to see Military Governor Ye. Military Governor Ye had a specific time set aside each day to meet guests. There were always around a hundred people seeking an audience. Each batch would chat for a few minutes. From 4 pm to 6 pm, the time was still not enough. He couldn't possibly meet everyone. Either the time was up, or there was other official business that came up temporarily, or he occasionally felt annoyed and tired. Then he would announce the end and tell them to come back tomorrow. If they still didn't get a turn tomorrow, luckily there was the day after. If it was still the same the day after, they might as well wait for him every day for the rest of their lives. It seemed to depend entirely on luck, and the skill of the registry in distributing the large stack of cards into batches at that moment.</p>

<h3>Officialese</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>The meaning of the four characters "officialese" is equivalent to a bad check. The check exists, but it cannot be cashed. If you search for such bad checks in newspapers, there are countless examples every day. Today, I will only cite one example. Foreign Minister Luo Wengan said that he received a telegram from Zhang Xueliang, stating that the situation in Yuguan was serious and that our side had made considerable preparations. He also said that the Northeast problem could not be resolved through diplomatic channels and could only be dealt with by force. It was also heard that Zhang, due to the urgency in Yuguan, would fly to Beijing within days to personally request instructions. According to the telegram, Zhang has made considerable preparations in Yuguan. But I don't know if the preparations are based on the (non-resistance) doctrine or the (resistance) doctrine? As for the so-called personal request for instructions, is it to be given the (long-term resistance) instruction or the (short-term resistance) instruction? This is what is called one type of officialese.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Renshen Year</h3>
<p>— Han He</p>
<p>The sound of war drums shatters my heart, the powerful invaders have invaded our borders for no reason. Empty calls for help bring only tears from the generals, the rise and fall depends entirely on the shoulders of the common people. I can't bear to see the divine tripod sink into the Si River, competing to destroy copper mountains to cast salaries. It was a miscalculation to gather hazel and lingzhi, how can we bear to see the setting sun fall into the Yu Abyss. On one corner of the sea frontier stands a lone army, who will write a poem of common hatred to stop the enemy's atmosphere. The division of Yan and Yun poses an urgent border threat, the parties are divided like the factions of Luo and Shu. The Jin's destruction of Song is a warning from the past, Qi and Chu honoring Zhou are merely empty words. I ask the guest by the Tianjin Bridge, have you heard the cuckoo crying blood? Yellow leaves are everywhere in the villages south of the Yangtze River, pitiful to see that there is no door to look forward to. Yue and Qin fought to the death over peace and war, what caused Niu and Li to form resentment? The journey on boats and cars fills dreams with sorrow, the pine and chrysanthemum in the old garden have long ceased to exist. When will we roast and eat the whale and eel, laughing as we add it to the wine and swallow it with the east wind. How many are there among the comrades who chant together, the rivers and mountains are no longer the same, the years are new. Who will test the general's arrow on Tianshan, it is difficult to find the fuel of the hegemon in Kuaiji. The Ming is on the verge of extinction, yet they compete to form parties, the Han made many mistakes, first seeking peace. I gradually feel that the universe is narrow, turning to envy the people of Tongjiang and Ying Shui.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Electroplating</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Electroplating has a wide range of applications in industry. Simple experiments are also interesting and easy to do. Any keys or other small metal parts that need to be protected from rust or made more beautiful can be plated with a layer of other metals. In addition, patterns on seals, plants, or coins can be reproduced and are exactly like the originals. Principle: When a solution of a metal salt (electrolyte) is passed through direct current, it decomposes. The pure metal substance adheres to the negative electrode, and the oxygen and acids that combine with the salt adhere to the positive electrode. A. Plating other metals on metal objects. Equipment: 1. One or several 5-4 volt dry batteries. 2. A porcelain container (ordinary bowls or glass cups can also be used). Electrolyte: Any metal salt solution can be used. Here are a few examples: 1. For copper plating, copper sulfate can be dissolved in an appropriate amount of water. 2. For silver plating, one part silver carbonate, ten parts potassium cyanide, and one hundred parts clear water. 3. For nickel plating, five parts nickel nitrate, five parts sodium bisulfite, and one hundred parts clear water. Arrangement: Pour the electrolyte into a porcelain container, immerse the object to be plated and suspend it in the air, connect it to the negative electrode of the battery, and suspend a metal sheet of the same metal as the electrolyte at the positive electrode (a carbon rod can be used instead of a silver sheet for plating a small amount of silver). After several hours, the electroplating is completed. It can be taken out, washed, and polished. Note: Before electroplating any object, it must first be cleaned of rust and dirt with fine sandpaper, washed in dilute sodium hydroxide, and then wiped with dilute hydrochloric acid, otherwise it may not last long and will easily peel off. B. Reproducing patterns. For example, if you have a badge or an ancient coin and want to reproduce its surface pattern, you can first press wax, clay, or plaster on the object to obtain a negative model. Then, lightly coat it with pencil lead powder with a dry brush to make the surface conductive. Then, electroplate it as described above. After it has a certain thickness, take it out and separate it from the mold. Other things such as cloth, plant leaves, and beetles can also be electroplated, which is very interesting. However, due to space limitations, I will not go into detail. In industry, metals such as aluminum, pure iron, copper in the electrical industry, and other extremely pure metals can all be obtained by electrolysis. Therefore, electrochemistry is worthy of promotion.</p>
<p>A Word of Advice on Education</p>
<h3>The Level of University Students</h3>
<p>— Jin Huan</p>
<p>It is truly unbearable to ask. The level of such a university student is beyond the comprehension of ordinary people. It is truly not only laughable but also infuriating. This university student is naturally an exception, and it cannot be said that most university students are like this. The day before yesterday, a certain university held an entrance examination for transfer students and accepted many transfer students from several universities that had been destroyed. My old friend Song Yin, after grading the papers, said with a laugh, "Now, I will introduce to you a few answers from the transfer students of a certain university. Do you think they are funny or not?" 1. What are the Five Dynasties? Answer: Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing. 2. What is the Three Kingdoms period? Answer: England, France, America. 3. The cause of the Shanghai War? Answer: Chinese and Japanese soldiers shooting at each other (one answer was too long to record, please read the major newspapers). 4. Who is the current Chairman of the National Government? Answer: Chiang Kai-shek (some wrote Wang Jingwei). 5. Where is the headquarters of the League of Nations? Answer: London (many wrote Paris). 6. What is the purpose of the Chinese National Revolution? Answer: Sun Yat-sen wanted to be emperor, so he overthrew Yuan Shikai. 7. What are the Three Principles of the People? Answer: The Three Principles of the People are our country's laws. 8. What are the Five Continents? Answer: Suzhou, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Zhengzhou. 9. What nationality is Chamberlain? Answer: Zhang Jun Chamberlain is of course Chinese (it can be seen from the name that the surname and name are Chinese). 10. What is Doihara? Answer: China is an agricultural country, and to make the land fertile, fertilizer should be used. There were also answers such as "Song Ziwen is the son of Song Jiaoren" and "Cai Yuanpei and Cai E were brothers." It is truly amazing that they can think of such things. I am laughing with anger, so I specially introduce the level of students in a certain university. Alas!</p>
<p>Through a Telescope</p>
<h3>Afraid to Drink Ice</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident occurred in the three northeastern provinces, my classmate ×××'s blood suddenly boiled. Whether it was fundraising or joining the volunteer army, he was always the vanguard of the entire school. (Brother Ji! Are you really cold-blooded? With the situation so tense, you still don't throw your pen and join the army to kill the enemy?) At this time, I was criticized by him, and I felt very ashamed in my conscience. I felt countless anxieties all over my body. I immediately got up and threw all kinds of textbooks on the table, my eyes glaring at classmate ××× in a daze. (Are you willing to join the volunteer army?) (Brother, to be honest, my physique is really not suitable for saving the country. I can handle propaganda.) (Alas! Our country will not perish, what country will perish? If everyone is like you, making excuses, who will save the country?) After saying that, he snorted through his nose and left angrily. After separating from classmate ××× that day, I haven't seen him for several months. I miss him very much. I don't know how hard he is working on the front line. His enthusiasm for saving the country fills me with 120% admiration. Suddenly, on a Saturday afternoon, I happened to meet him on Nanjing Road, and he was even accompanied by a modern girl. When he saw me, he seemed very embarrassed. (×××, long time no see. Did you meet this female comrade on the front line? Which front are you fighting on now?) (Brother Ji, don't mention it. The weather is really hot. How about going for some ice?) (Thank you, I won't go, because if I drink ice, I'm afraid the heat of patriotism will be reduced to zero.)</p>
<p>Chatting About Everything</p>
<h3>Amusing Misunderstandings</h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>It is a great inconvenience that the language of a country cannot be unified. For example, in our country, each province has its own language, and each county and town has its own local dialect. Our country's language is so complex that it can be called the crown of the world. Often, people are in the same hall, all people from the same country, but because they don't understand each other's language (such as Cantonese and Zhejiang people, Fujian and Jiangsu people...), they have to ask for a translator, otherwise, there will be jokes. My family recently hired a new nanny, who is from Wuhu, Anhui. She calls a (teapot) a (skewer). One day, it was raining, and she said to my mother that she was going to get the repaired (skewer). So my mother misunderstood for a moment, thinking that because it was raining, she wanted to take a car to get the (teapot), so she said to her, (It's raining, you should hold an umbrella, why waste money taking a car?). After arguing for a long time, she finally understood that she was going to get the (teapot). Thinking about it carefully, it was hard not to laugh. Therefore, I thought of a joke that my third maternal uncle told me the other day. He said, (There is a kind of vegetable in the south called (horse basket head), while in the north it is called (livestock basket brain). Because northerners call (horse) (livestock), call (basket) (basket), call (head) (brain)). One day, the master asked the servant to buy (horse basket head) and said (livestock basket brain). This servant was from the south, and although he didn't understand the meaning of the word, he didn't dare to ask too many questions. So he walked all over Beijing (now called Beiping) and didn't know where to buy this (livestock basket brain). Later, after asking others in many ways, he finally knew that it was (horse basket head). This joke of not understanding the language is also enough to make people laugh. At the same time, I also thought of one day, I saw a Cantonese person wanting to talk to a Zhejiang person in a certain place, but unfortunately, they spoke different languages, but they could both speak English. They had no choice but to use English as a temporary substitute for the national language, so they talked a lot in English. I often see Chinese people meeting and speaking foreign languages as fashionable, which always makes me feel sad. The two brothers mentioned in this article speaking English so much is another matter, because they speak different languages, if they don't speak English, then they can only be like the silent Jin people, otherwise, it is inevitable to make jokes. From this, it can be seen that unifying the national language is really an important thing.</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<h3>Norma Shearer's Divorcée</h3>
<p>Divorcée, starring the aristocratic and romantic female star Norma Shearer, is Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's latest production. Norma Shearer's performance in this play is superb and intoxicating. The novelty and dazzlingness of her costumes is rarely seen anywhere. There are several scenes that show the state of love in adolescence, which is truly wonderful and indescribably beautiful. And the male lead Maurice, paired with her, is even more brilliant. Those who like to watch Norma Shearer's movies will surely feel that this movie's romance is rare among her productions. This film was publicly screened in Paris.</p>
<h3>The Heart-Stirring Scandal of a Fallen Woman</h3>
<p>The blockbuster Scandal of a Fallen Woman (Silent Witness), which recently premiered at the Nanjing Grand Theater, stars Greta Nissen, the former lead actress of Passionate Blood in the Desert. She is a very talented woman in Hollywood, proficient in music, dance, and sculpture. Her achievements in the film industry are particularly great. Her style of coquetry has long been known to rival Greta Garbo. Silent Witness is her latest masterpiece. In the film, she plays a fallen woman who lures inexperienced teenagers down the path of depravity, performing in a way that truly captivates the human soul. The male lead, Lyn Harding, is known for his stage plays and is highly respected in the art world. His inner performance reaches the peak of perfection. He has played the role of a loving father in the play Silent Witness over a hundred times. His performance of a loving son, willing to sacrifice himself for his fallen son, is even willing to bet his life on it. The sad and tragic parts make people weep, and the overall structure of the film is wonderful, with sorrow, passion, and adjustment properly arranged. It is truly one of the crown jewels of Fox Corporation this year.</p>
<h3>Carlton's Sneak Preview of The Love Habit</h3>
<p>Carlton's next premiere, The Love Habit, is a romantic comedy blockbuster about a lecher who admires a married woman, whose husband is also a lecher with other affairs. The lecher uses this point to try to get his wife, but the result is that because the woman maintains her chastity, his efforts are in vain. It satirizes the humorous, and is a very humane work. The film is based on the works of famous writers, and the plot is very tortuous. The stars of this film are all silver screen generals. The humor inserted is often unexpected, making people unable to help but smile. There are also several scenes in the film that are romantic and unbearable to watch, truly enough to make people lose their souls.</p>
