<p>時評</p>
<h3>法總統杜美爾被刺</h3>
<p>彬</p>
<p>法總統杜美爾突於前日遭遇不幸之狙擊。延至昨晨四時許。竟以傷重薨殂。一國元首。竟犧甡於宵小之一擊。此誠足以令全世界人哀悼感喟於無窮。</p>
<p>此一鉅案之内幕。至今尙無正確足以徵信之消息。據電訊所傳。吾人但知行剌之兇手爲俄人。其名爲戈古洛夫。而其供詞則自承爲俄羅斯之愛國者。崇拜墨索里尼及希特勒之爲人。憤法助蘇聯。其剌杜氏。爲欲迫令法國反對蘇聯。并稱美林白之子。亦爲其所綁。供詞奇離閃爍。若爲神經病者。又若故意裝瘋。不易捉摸。但就吾人之推斷。則此震動世界之血案。其背景斷不如戈古洛夫所供之簡單。而戈古洛夫之爲非神經病者。要亦爲無須置疑之問題。</p>
<p>吾人認爲杜氏之遭遇不幸。應不外乎下列二因。</p>
<p>一日國際間之一大陰謀也。自歐戰結朿而後。法國憑藉凡爾賽條約及其優越之國力。顯然以歐洲之霸權者自居。其對於德奥兩國。以防止其復興頗力。故其所以對德奥者亦頗嚴。法之强盛。幾於完全以凡爾賽條約爲其基礎。而法之所厚。則他國之所薄。彼被壓抑於凡爾賽條約下之諸戰敗國。其茹辛忍痛飲泣呑聲之情狀。蓋爲世人所可想見。意則感於法之威脅。其對於法之全歐霸權之實現。固亦無時不以爲慮。怨毒之所積。妬念之所激。在此國際糾紛之情勢下。固難保不有軌外之行動。此不幸事件發生之可能者一也。</p>
<p>又如遠東情勢。近日趨緊張。日俄間巳劍拔弩張。待機而動。一面美俄聯盟之呼聲甚囂塵上。另一面又屢有日法密約之風傳。則在此風雲緊張之際。又安知陰毒者不下毒辣之手叚。圓遂其栽禍挑撥之陰謀。以激起法人之忿恨。而造成一種犄角之形勢。前數月駐俄日大使之被謀剌。其内幕固巳耐人推敲國際間之陰謀。固無所不有。此不幸事件之可能發生者又一也。</p>
<p>次則曰法西斯主義之激盪也。由於資本主義之動搖與崩潰。左傾勢力固日見强大。而右傾之法西斯主義。則亦頓呈迴光返照之現象。軍國主義之抬頭。國家主義之復興。在各國都有同樣之情勢。以狹隘之愛國思想之剌激。狂𤍠之徒。遂不恤肆其毒手。擾亂秩序。以博取虚名。以震懾社會。日濱口之被剌。與大規模暗殺陰謀之破獲。即其先例。此次法國之不幸事件。遂於此種動機。</p>
<p>之下發生。則又無不可能也。</p>
<p>雖然。邇近以來。暗殺之風盛行。頗足以令人談虎色變。在日本前有濱口之慘變。繼有井上與團琢磨之被戕。最近復有上海之炸案。在蘇聯前有暗殺駐日廣田大使陰謀事件。近如西班牙有剌害元首之謀。埃首相之險遭不測。茲在法國。復有杜氏之不幸事件。由於經濟之動盪。進而影響於政治之不安。蓋至顯然。吾人迴首一九一四年由於奥皇儲之被剌。擴大而爲全世界互相肉搏殘殺之慘禍。殊不能不興起山雨欲來風滿樓之感。往事未遠。危機又動。亦可慨矣。</p>

<h3>洛陽五五紀念會</h3>

<p>洛訊、五日國府舉行五五紀念會、林主席等均有致詞、分錄如下、</p>
<p>林森　略謂、今天是五月五日、就是民國十年總理在廣州就任非常大總統的紀念日、今天我們在這裏開紀念大會、回想到總理當日就職的情形、經過了許多波折和許多困難、才實現的、因爲那時有許多人不明白總理就職的意思、故持反對之論、其實總理當時就職唯一的意志、就是要統一中國、積極北伐、掃除革命的障碍、鞏固中華民國的基礎、總理基此意志、所以在就任非常總統之後第一步、就出師北伐、期貫澈其主張、實在統一、毫沒有私心或權利之見、存於其間、這一點、就民國元年、總理讓職於袁世凱一事證之、很可以明白看到的、當民國元年、總理就臨時大總統之職、其後因政策根本不行、遂讓職於袁世凱、當時有許多同志、不明總理意思、頗有勸阻者、因爲那時北方有一部份武裝同志和一部份非同志軍人、都表示贊助共和、殊不必讓位於袁、但總理則以所志不行、且共和旣有人贊助、則成功不必自我、終將總統位置讓出、這可見總理天下大公的懷抱了、由於這一點、我們可以看出總理就非常大總統職、並不是想對自身地位上有什麽增益、他在元年讓位於袁世凱、與十年就任非常大總統、形勢雖然異趣、精神確是一貫、就是全爲一個公字、想爲國家謀統一、爲國人謀利益、他這種不惜犧牲和不辭勞瘁的苦心、當時許多人不明白、今天在場諸同志中、也有知道這種情形、知道當年的種種苦痛與波折者、所以在今天紀念的日子、我們應回想到、總理當年百折不撓的精神、完全是至公無私、爲國爲民的、現在正是國家時局非常嚴重的時候、我們對於總理生前昭示的遺型、應當怎樣猛省、怎樣體全、怎樣刻苦力行、才不負今天紀念的意思、</p>
<p>焦易堂　略謂、今天五五節紀念、就是在廣州就護法總統的紀念、一個國家的成立、完全繫於法、沒有法或不守法、即不爲國家、中華民國成立之後、原是有法的、因爲常有人毁法、所以弄得連年内亂、到現在巳形成重大的國難、致行都到洛陽、陪都到西安、我們今後不獨要守法以安定國本、而且要本總理所說的恢復中國固有文明、來振興國家、要師周公訓成王之義、來訓練民衆、舉辦下級地方自治、急速恢復周禮、用伍兩卒旅師軍制度、把人與人組織起來、國家有事、即以此爲兵、無事即作田役、即用州黨族閭鄰的制度、把家與家組織起來、一面藉此奬人民生產、一面也可强迫人民生產、此種固有文明、確是經國之大本、自治之寳筏、應該努力實行、復次、周代的百官、不曰百官而曰百工、官的俸祿、等於農夫的收入、所以仕風不囂、民安其業、這也足常借鏡的、現在國難嚴重、大家應篤守遺敎、努力爲國、才不負總理平生倡導守法爲國恢復固有文明的苦心、</p>
<p>居正　略謂、總理當年就非常大總統職、不是本身地位增高的問題、而是爲擔負改造國家應有的責任、總理當時所抱的政策、軍事上主張北伐、求國家統一、政治上主張各省均權分治、因爲中國地廣人衆、要是一省一省集權於中央政府、治理上一定感到許多不便、所以總理力主各省均權分治、而實際歸於統一、當他就非常總統之後、即遺兵出湘北伐、恰巧那時湖南省議會有自選省長之制、總理認爲可行、就想把此制推行到各省、以速民治之實現、這是第一點、其次、當時各省都有很多軍隊、總理要想方法消納此溢量的軍隊、於是有工兵制和民兵制創議、如古屯墾之制、把所有軍隊、逐漸工農化、此外對於各地自治事宜、也有詳細的計劃和說明、其主旨完全以民有民治民享爲立足點、並想不用武力統一中國、這是第二點、凡此、都可見總理謀國公忠與做事負責的精神、他於民國十年的今天、毅然就非常大總統職、亦是這個道理、今日我們在此舉行紀念、不幸恰在國難期中、實使我們感覺無限的沈痛、但是這個對日問題、我們要弄個淸楚、今後對日關係、如不確定一個妥善方針來、其禍害必有不可勝計者、兄弟以爲今後如能堅持長期抵抗、則最後勝利、必屬於我、因爲日本國小人稠、糧食有限、國内情形、複雜異常、知識界與經濟界、處處暴露不調整的狀態、就其經濟言、日本國用年達十七萬萬金元、至少亦須十六萬萬金元、而收入方面、賦稅祇佔極小部分、大部份全恃工商業盈餘之捐輸、若我國能與之作長期抵抗、日必大受影響、所以我國現在抵抗日本、不在一時的兵爭、而在長期的抵抗、希望同志們、同下决心、來準備抵抗、實現抵抗、</p>
<h3>蘇省出口生絲免稅</h3>
<p>政府允每担補助推銷費百兩</p>
<p>江浙絲繭業、近年以改良育蠶、出口增加、不料歐美購買力不振、日絲跌價、中國天災人禍、人民購布且無力、更無餘力購買絲綢、因此今年所存生絲達二萬餘担、蠶繭十萬石之巨、如不設法推銷、春繭更難出新、蘇省府主席顧祝同、實業廳長何玉書、兩次赴京、先後協商增加人造絲入口稅、及取銷中國天然絲出口稅、以求根本之救濟、茲聞何氏由京電省、出口免稅巳辦到、並由政府每担生絲補助推銷費銀一百兩、蘇錫一帶繭市、得此消息、巳現活動景象、此爲蘇省府改組以來、關於民生最有價値之措施、可以增加江南全部及江北一部農民之生產、惟人造絲增加入口稅、尙須待商耳、</p>

<p>套頭拉攏</p>
<p>美金合銀三兩三錢六分一三</p>
<p>昨日銀市英跌美平、而匯兌略有異趨、英升美降、惟匯豐掛牌未有變動、僅以德匯加二五、至於英美兩匯、内部行情、早晨尙平、旋後見硬、結果則平、雖金市暴落十兩、破進七百三十兩、實係廣帮出籠所致、兼之傳聞美金將欲取銷金本位之空氣、不無影響也、無如匯市並弗過鬆、套頭拉攏、揭價多撳十兩、計達八十兩、迨午收比上日計英金長一八七五、美金僅長一八七五、至二五、華商金帮大都抛出、計英金約成交七八萬鎊、沙遜洋行亦有售出、而美金約共一百萬元之譜、以八月份居多數、各號努力而塞、下午因週六無市、</p>

<h3>厘跌難於終止</h3>
<p>雙毫下落…銅元驟長</p>
<p>市塲槪况　昨値週末、銀行祇半天營業、下午照例無市、故大勢上業務頗爲冷僻、市塲中洋厘以根本未有轉機、終屬於跌、而銀拆微見好面、輔幣以雙毫銷胃窒滯、故亦墜落、銅元驟長、亦爲前昨日之特殊景象、差幸市面尙安、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市厘價爲七錢零三厘、較前日早市計小二厘、午市又弱一毫二忽半、爲七錢零二厘八毫七忽半、（銀拆）早市及午市同爲六分、較前日略又好起二分、銀行掛牌仍無行市、劃頭加水開盤爲一錢、旋高至一錢五分、最後收盤時大濫、而爲白劃、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋較前日跌小二厘、計爲六錢一分七厘、早午均同、交易早市二千角、午市無交易、廣東小洋早市爲六錢零一厘半、午市爲六錢零一厘二毫半　較前日跌小二厘有奇、交易早市十二萬角、午市僅一萬角、銅元突長三千文、爲四百十八千文、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市漸有起色望</h3>
<p>五九花紗市塲停市一日</p>
<p>紗市漸見佳象、實需益覺活動、形勢有起色之望、久巳沉悶之江西帮、業巳發動採辦、故現紗市情、較昨爲堅、但其他帮口胃量仍滯、華北一帶日紗充斥、本紗早巳無挿足餘地、至本埠日商紗廠、工作逐漸恢復常態、暗中活動甚烈、所以本紗受其重大打擊、有一部份廠商心思鬆動、對於現紗毫無扳緊之念、隨勢而走、以致囤積或可輕縮、不過邇來跌勢太巨、暫時應有一度之回漲可能也、但時局不寗、金融呆木、均與紗市大有密切之關係耳、</p>
<p>人標漲五六錢　人標前市開盤、以上日形勢緊俏、兼之外　又漲、塲中賣户缺乏、但交易仍少、各月又漲五六錢、午後市勢平、本月漲一錢、遠平、全日成交統計四千九百五十包、查賣出長豐四百包、協生二百包、義餘三百五十包、瑞大七百包、願大一百五十包、賡豐一百包、振大一百包、買進明德一百五十包、昶記三百五十包、長豐九百包、吉豐一百包、恒昌一百五十包、仁豐一百包、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市俏狀更進一步</h3>
<p>棉市狀况尤形緊俏、因美棉連漲幾日紗市轉佳、致棉市更挺、以本棉底貨較少、塲中新抛户缺乏、形勢愈昻、但實需方面仍然沉滯、各廠心思極其呆木、至於外棉市盤雖漲、金價趨疲、採算銀盤仍較本花爲廉、所以市况亦無大升象云、</p>
<p>鄭標好三四錢　鄭標前市開盤、以美印棉均漲、塲中人氣緊張賣户較缺、各月漲二·三錢、午後形勢仍堅、各月漲五分、全日成交統計一萬六千一百担、查賣出愼昌三百担、瑞大一千二百担、同興四百担、長豐一千一百担、大昶三百担、源大一千六百担、長和一千担、振大二百担、買進明德七百担、恒益一千二百担、昶記七百担、愼記四百担、願大一千四百担、長和一千五百担、泰興八百担、餘昶一各一百担、茲將鄭標收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>絲茶土莊新綠茶巳開盤</h3>
<p>本埠土莊製茶廠、連日由諸曁·泗安·湖洲·遂安等處、運來新毛茶、爲數不下二百餘包、各茶廠如天成·義同興·萬成祥·吳森記等、均巳一律興工趕製紹興頭批珍眉、新盤巳於前昨兩日、由怡和協和等行、開出一百二十兩至一百二十五兩、至遂安湖州等路葉底較優之貨、聞下星期一、亦有大批陸續上市云、</p>
<h3>祁門紅茶新樣到滬</h3>
<p>祁門紅茶、昨日巳由九江寄到新樣二字、經怡和茶師評判結果、認香味條子、均較上年尤佳、惟因去冬霜過多、各路收成、均告歉折、據一般茶商調查估計、本年祁浮建德產額、合計不過四萬八千餘箱、較往年約减十分之二云、</p>
<h3>遂安毛茶價跌</h3>
<p>遂安綠茶、自上月二十七日開秤後、因買方進意濃厚、每擔提問至九十四元、嗣因各山頭產額旺盛、號家亦鑒於茶價過昻、深覺危險、業經聚議、一律停秤、市價因之猛跌十五六元、現聞該處茶號、及上海客帮、又復開辦、惟議定茶價、不准繼續抬高云、</p>
<h3>糧食河下米市向上</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮來源不多、因天時關係、人心向上、店號雙方講辦存貨、立夏節巳過、米價必硬、常錫北硬本城略有應酬、昨日喊起二角有零、薄稻浦存亦少、開盤降增角許、早稻及洋杜尖銷塲極殷、情况站定、變陰二元昨到四筒、當日如數解完、行情跳起二三角左右、</p>
<p>滬北　昨内地來源十餘號、城鄉店胃不見十分活動、常錫北粳及崑山米各提一角、薄稻寗胃轉細、本街略動、行情亦增五分、洋蘆尖貨色寥寥、形勢定局、通變陰化酒户需要尙好、開盤硬起近角、</p>

<p>昨日洋米市况極活、漢口江北崇明無錫南京及本街散户均有問津、市形大見起色、漢口帮因下星期又須增加水脚、日上裝出甚多、昨日更有軍米去路、市面更爲望好、統市開小絞有一萬五千以上、惟邇日迭有到貨、在此十天内到有各米十五萬包光景、因此銷化雖活、行情未克上漲、昨開小絞十元○三角至十元○○五分、特高小絞市上曾喊至十元○四角　及十元○三角八分但無成交、西貢一號米一千包、價十一元半、小絞糙五百包、價九元四角、又江西陳元四百十包、價十三元四角八分及十一元七角九分云、</p>
<h3>粉市被洋麥帶好</h3>
<p>昨日洋麥電報、支坎兩地一致報漲、漲起五角及三角不等、粉市形勢略爲轉好、且以北方稍有去胃、市價前日狂落後、及引起本街與客户之間津、低次各粉亦有去化、五月份標粉開價即至二兩○二分繼至二兩○三分收市、比前市較大分外、老車牌開二兩○二分七厘半、後形似可暫居定勢矣、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白突漲至十三兩</h3>
<p>劃盤交易頗暢</p>
<p>糖市公會市塲劃盤交易頗盛、　勢均甚堅消、荷糖二十四號粗砂白成交價升爲十三兩、香港貨十二兩八錢半、後市升至十二兩九錢、出户甚缺、市氣頗挺、大有逐升之象、太古糖　　十六兩三錢半、ＤＹ嘜十五兩三錢、ＨＭ嘜十三兩七錢半、比前亦均微升、而市形甚爲　秀云、</p>
<h3>疋頭棉布在平和狀態中</h3>
<p>本廠棉布邇日趨勢平定、客帮去路以北方較佳、故重磅粗布頗爲活動、昨又成交十三磅財神六兩二錢半、十五磅財神七兩三錢、十六磅雙魚吉慶等二百多件、汕頭厦門二帮自共亂後頗少採辦、寗波台州亦較前爲靜、本街門店去路頗形起色、故金三塔漂布復漲五分、須八兩五、本街頗有採辦、細布染廠帮趨勢觀望、祇本街零星去路、以藍神英藍鷄汽球走勢較佳、細斜頗呆、常州貨更形見靜、故多數售六兩五六錢、粗斜邇來又靜、價亦無大變動、西貨疋頭、仍呆、惟元素府綢本街進意略濃、昨一線一紗之發多數售五錢左右、條子仍形停頓云、</p>
<h3>呢羢市面進展</h3>
<p>昨日呢羢市面、漸漸轉機、本客帮交易比上星期繁盛、蓋時局刻巳平靜如昔、銀根亦漸轉鬆動、賣買生意、隨而發展、定貨號均肯蓋印放賬、對於零拆亦極遷就、不若上月份之不許墊出矣、如雨衣布·嗶嘰花呢·直貢華特呢·夏白貨法蘭羢類、公會上都有開出、惜市盤售價仍無上漲、此乃時局與天時之關係耳、</p>
<h3>五金棋子銅跌價五錢</h3>
<p>棋子銅爲兵工廠及四川帮之繁銷品、每年銷塲、爲數頗夥、惟近幾年來、因市貨太少、行情提高不少、現售一百八十五兩、但自從加價之後、底位太昻、以致採辦者反裹足不前、因之交易大受打擊、而標準巳於無形中减落五錢、計售一百八十兩、惟買户仍不多、逆料前途、行情恐尚要再小云、</p>
<h3>新鐵絲昨有走動</h3>
<p>久趨冷落之新鐵絲、昨因四川漢口各帮、均有問津、是以市情較爲𤍠閙、行情雖一時不見提加、但人心良佳、故亦無趨疲之傾向、現市十六號至二十號每担開十三兩二錢半、二十一號至二十五號售十四兩、調查市貨極少、苟來日生意一動、前途存貨殊有軋缺之虞也、</p>

<h3>母親節之重要紀念</h3>
<p>— 碧漪</p>
<p>中華婦女節制協會。以五月八日。各國所紀念之母親節將屆。曾致函各分會。請於是日。舉行母子同樂會。以資發揚該會素所提倡之孝道。並規定種種方法。以表示下輩致愛母親之心。意至善也。或謂毛詩云。哀哀父母。生我劬勞。是父母之當紀念。劬勞旣同。宜乎相提並論。不合偏重於母者也。不知從事實上一爲體察。則劬勞之苦。母親爲尤甚。農田家之山歌有云。「十月懷胎娘辛苦。三年乳哺母辛勤。」實地寫出。眞所謂假曲子弗及眞山歌也。蓋觀此二語。便知母親所負之責任。更重於父親。故其劬勞之恩。亦比父親爲尤甚耳。雖乳哺之辛勤。有力者類皆委責於人。雇用乳母。其實產兒以食親母之乳爲宜。生理學家論之詳矣。况一般無力者。烏能卸此重任乎。歸震川先生先妣事略一篇。人人誦之而欲淚者也。其云。「大者牽衣。小者乳哺。手中紅綴不輟。」貧家母親之劬勞。歷歷如繪。又况懷胎之辛苦。臨產之因難。無論貴族富室。無有能卸其劬勞之責任。而雇人替代者。是以母親節之紀念。尤當視爲重要。並非單就婦女協會本身言。但知有母親也。其云該會素所提倡孝道。則知劬勞之恩。父母並念矣。</p>
<h3>說但澤</h3>
<p>— 開煦</p>
<p>近據歐洲報紙所傳。波蘭近有呑併但澤自由城之企圖。終以隣國之干涉。未能成爲事實。事後波蘭當局及各有關係方面。均發表辯正書。聲明傳言之無據。夫世界各國慓悍軍閥之行徑。如出一轍。侵人土地。據爲己有。傳言旣非無據。辯者亦屬多事。查但澤自由城。位於巴爾的海之南岸。有維斯多拉河横貫其中。爲歐陸商業之中樞。水陸軍事上必爭之地。四週大國。如德。如俄。如波蘭。如普魯士邦。如瑞典丹麥。莫不環視耽耽。各欲遂其鯨呑之志。然但澤以咫尺彈丸之地。四十萬之民衆。終能拒强隣於境外。不失其獨立國之尊嚴。嗚呼。較之我東北三省之淪亡於旦夕者何如。但澤以一城而立國。而我國則幅員萬倍。且不能立國。但澤在中古之時。曾以數千烏合之衆與英吉利戰。敗之而擄倫敦之市長以歸。使英國數百年中。未敢以其地小而加以藐視。後曾一敗於波蘭。波蘭以戰勝之威。本可遂其鯨呑之志。然終畏其民氣而聽其獨立。波但之間。敵體相視。凡波王與但澤來往之文件。俱以拉丁或德文爲主。從未敢以波蘭文字相加。此條頓民族不可侮之精神有以致之者也。後波蘭爲隣國割裂而亡。但澤一城。獨得保其自主。但澤之民族。德人也。而德人亦無呑併之志。後遂以民族自决之志願。依附於德。歐戰後。波蘭復國。但澤爲毘連波蘭之海口。然終不以屬之波蘭。僅爲波蘭另闢襟帶之地。以通於海。而名之曰波蘭之走廊焉。Ｃｏｒｒｉｄｏｒ然波蘭以走廊迂曲不便。致呑併但澤之志。終不稍衰。然亦豈能遂如其意。嗚呼。吾念及此。不覺撫膺長歎。但願爲小國自由之民。而不願爲大國之亡國奴也。</p>

<h3>梁某</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>梁某忘其名。曩昔鄰家子也。體健碩。喜運動。彼時學校中方有運動會。觀者至衆。梁在運動會中。跑也跳也。屢奪錦標。大顯男兒身手。年少英俊。誠可兒也。辛亥革命軍起義武昌。梁攘臂而起日。昔魯童汪琦能執干戈以衛社稷。吾年雖少。然巳較汪琦爲長。安能不盡國民之天職乎。遂背其家人。私往從軍。在。</p>
<p>武漢數月。受創而歸。自憾未能死於沙塲。家人皆異之。自此梁遂不再求學。及二次革命時。鈕永建氏在松江組織學生軍。梁又濳往投入。家人不能禁。當革命軍在滬攻製造局時。學生軍尤奪勇衝鋒。大半犧牲其生命於彈雨之下。梁亦與焉。惜功敗垂成。學生軍遂無形解散。而梁之消息竟杳如焉。家人佇望其歸。久之不見影蹤。四出探問。亦不得知其存亡。意者梁巳捐軀沙塲矣。今茲滬戰起時。又有學生軍參加。殺敵致果。爲國犧牲。使梁某若尙在世間者。必又投袂而起矣。可念哉此子也。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（四五）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第六回　可憐同夢夜迫爲床下盟　猶憶初戀時負卻窗間約</p>
<p>如今且不必先忙那些。還是請你在贊成我這個提議以後。先擇期宣布我們的婚約。舉行我們的婚禮。雖說你現在孝服中。大舉動有點不便。但邀請幾位。</p>
<p>熟友作證。登報紙廣告宣布。將種種手續辦完全。使外人明瞭我們這是正式合法的婚姻。那總是不可少的。也請你今晚就給我一個决定。以便提早實行。你該不至於還有什麽推諉罷。說時。意態雍容。又吸燃了一支紙烟。靜候安玉田的回答。安玉田這時本巳被迫到要屈服於床下之盟。只準備趁早遞上降書降表了事。但因爲聽到婚約婚禮兩件咄咄還人之事。猛地想起前晚照樣先就有此提議的李問霞來。不由暗暗呌苦。這婚姻大事非同兒戲。曾答應了一個人。便不能再對第二人爲輕率的允諾。偏偏這兩天事勢會來得這般奇突。一波未平。一波又起。第一人正猛烈要求履行舊約。尙未有妥適的處置。而第二者乘間提出新盟。亟待迅速的解决。如今左右爲難。無法兼顧。歸降於這眼前的第二者。便是喜新忘舊。將來何以處置那第一人。若執意以前情爲重。拒絶這第二者。卻又自悔荒唐。不該輕身嘗試。墜落於這密層蛛網之中。終於沒有話可解釋這番無故玷汚伊人淸白的妄舉。甚且因此還更想到今晚這嚴重的時間。也就是昨夜與李問霞約定在公寓中等候伊來共商大計的最緊要的時間。怎麽同一性質的大事。會無端換了一個對手與一處地方。移到這裏來另生枝節的與梁笑雲開玩笑。又怎麽剛才以前那幾個小時内。自己會昏瞶糊塗。將昨夜與李問霞的約會竟忘了個一乾二凈。而賴在這兒自找更大的煩惱。這眞是自己也難於原諒自己。對於李問霞和梁笑雲二人。都一律的大大對不起呢。一時惶恐百端。汗流浹背。就衝口道出自己的心病來道。這…這樣好便好。只是我…我以前還做…做過一件該死的事。曾與另一個女人有過那樣一句許婚的話。如今我和你正式作什麽舉動。在我是决沒有什麽不可。但那個女子郤難保沒有異。　異義。</p>

<h3>暗殺事件</h3>
<p>— 金</p>
<p>暗殺原最慘酷最殘忍的一件事，但是在行使這種手段方面，天然認爲「無路可走」，不得巳而出此最後的一着，不料這種慘酷而殘忍的事件，兩日之間，三國竟會同一時期内發生三件，殊爲不幸，</p>
<p>一巴黎六日電，法總統杜美爾，今日被暴徒鉏擊，連開五槍，杜身中三槍，業巳慘殞，</p>
<p>一瑪德里五日電，西班牙京城，近曾發現暗殺總理亞柴拉氏之陰謀，並有謀剌總統柴摩拉氏之企圖，</p>
<p>一開羅六日電，埃及首相錫特基，及其他有名政治家，旅行至迦瑪車站時，炸彈適在片刻前轟發，幸未遇禍，</p>
<p>以上三件的暗殺案，雖無連帶關係，或屬於國外的，或屬於國内的，其原因内幕若何，在未經明瞭眞相以前，不必加以討論，但一言蔽之，其中定含政治色彩，可以斷言，</p>
<p>據今日報載，行剌法總統兇手戈古羅夫供稱，因歐戰時，白俄參加作戰，頗帮法國之忙，現在白俄失敗至此，而法國袖手旁觀，不一援手，故而有此一擊，此供詞是否可靠，不得而知，不過白俄慘敗，赤俄當令，業巳多年，何以今日方思報復，殊爲疑問，其餘兩案，更未知其詳，</p>
<p>惟暗殺案的造成，必定有兩個對象，甲方面欲貫澈自己的主張，而不肯容納乙方面的主張，而乙方面的主張，旣無所施，乃出此慘酷而殘忍的手段，此理甚明，故暗殺案發生，則其國外或國内的政治，必呈隍杌不安的狀態，此是明顯的一個公例，</p>
<p>公說公有理，婆說婆有理，雙方曁各有一理，究屬公有理呢？還是婆有理？雙方的是非，可以不論，公一定不肯容婆的主張，婆一定不肯容公的主張，雙方均不能開誠布公，和衷共濟，致激烈者計無復之，乃出此殘酷之手段，此又一定的一個公例，</p>
<p>我誠悼法總統之不幸，而深爲一般政治家危，</p>

<h3>墨水製造法</h3>
<p>乃徵</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>墨水的用途甚廣，無論校中的先生學生，商界辦公室寫字間内，都要用牠，從前市上的墨水都是舶來品，近年來亦有國貨墨水出產，講到製造墨水，並不是一件極難的事，但要製得極好，則非有大資本去購辦機械來製造不可。</p>
<p>製墨水祇須略備玻璃器具等物如下··</p>
<p>醬油瓶一只，製好的墨水可以儲在裏面。舊墨水瓶一只，墨水儲在裏面，寫時用的。漏斗一只，夏布一方塊，小琺瑯鍋或面盆一只，竹或木小棒一二根。做各種墨水大槪用這些器具巳足夠。</p>
<p>墨色墨水（ＢｌａｃｋＬｎｋ）沒食子（粉末）（ＰｕｌｏＧａｌｌｉｃ）四英兩（４ｏｚ）沸水二磅（Ｑｐｉｎｔ）</p>
<p>硫酸鐵溶液（ＬｒｏｎＳｕｅｐｈａｔｅ）（Ｓｏｕｌｔｉｏｎ）一英兩半（１１／２ｏｚ）阿剌伯樹膠漿（ＧｕｍＡｒａｂｉｃ）四分之三英兩（３／４ｏｚ）克立阿曹脫（Ｃｒｅｏｓｏｔｅ）二三滴。</p>
<p>以上藥品，在西藥房或儀器店都有得買的，合起來牠的價錢是不滿五角大洋。但是做起來，可以變成一醬油瓶。</p>
<p>製造是非常便當，我們先以沒食子粉侵在沸水中一畫夜。（水冷了不必加𤍠）然後取夏布濾過，放在小面盆内，再拿硫酸鐵溶化在水中，完全溶化後，可把牠一同放在小面盆内，然後再加入阿剌伯樹膠漿，一面再拿小棒調動，使牠均匀，同時再加二三點克立阿曹脫，此時墨水就成功，即可用漏斗灌入醬油瓶内儲藏起來，用時祇要倒些舊墨水裏内，用完了，再倒些，非常便利，但舊的墨水瓶，第一次必須洗淸爽。再介紹一種藍墨水如下··</p>
<p>沒食子粉末，三英兩半，硫酸藍靛，二英兩半，硫酸鐵溶液，二英兩半，丁香，少許，阿剌伯樹膠漿，一英兩半，淸水，二磅（品脫）</p>
<p>製法與上面完全一樣，牠的顏色是一種非常美麗的藍色，寫在紙上很能耐久。</p>
<p>末了我要交代淸爽，這二個方子，大約是從一本（ＩｎｋＭａｎｕｆａｃｔｕｒｅ）上來的，但也說不定是這本書，新近我欣欣然到西藥房中去買了些藥品，回到家裏做，但是我心太急，沒食子侵在水中，侵了我吃過一頓夜飯的時間，就拿其牠的藥品加下去，結果大失其敗，顏色極淡，後來一研究，曉得毛病出在沒食子沒有浸透。第二次做得還不錯，第三四兩次，更加進步，至於上面方中的成分，我巳經稍爲改變過了，是最好一次結果的成分，照英文書本上的成分做出來不很好，我想他們决不肯拿好的成分告訴我們，這一點便靠自己活變，研究試騐改良，</p>

<h3>戰後</h3>
<p>— 毓賢</p>
<p>我偶然在南京路上散步，</p>
<p>南京路依舊是戰前的南京路，風頭十足的汽車，好像車水馬龍的奔馳，印度阿三依舊耀武揚威拿起棍子打黃包車夫的背脊，巨大的玻璃窗内，裝飾着引人注目的廣告，電燈，當然不分晝夜的點得很好看，而我們的公子小姐，也穿了新奇的服裝，點綴滬上的春色不少，</p>
<p>這裏沒有戰事的遺跡，</p>
<p>我偶然在民國路上散步，</p>
<p>民國路將恢復戰前的民國路，鐵棚門次第的開放了，戰事時託庇於租界的中國人，都搬回來了，商店開市了，（别管牠長期抵抗忍痛開市）最注目的是鐵絲網與沙袋，也不知不覺間消滅了，</p>
<p>這裏將要沒有戰事的遺跡</p>
<p>我不敢到吳淞去散步，</p>
<p>恐怕永遠留著慘痛的遺跡，引起了我心頭的惡感，</p>
<p>生</p>
<h3>外灘公園所見</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>情男情女和Ｘ國兵艦從馬路上的行人，影戲館裏的觀衆的面上，雖然看不出絲毫國難的色彩，但今年的春天，西子湖邊，龍華道上的遊春者，總究比往年冷淡了些吧，在過去的三個月中，就是無關於家無關於國的我，也覺得無心去遊春，無心去看影戲呢？直到前天的午後，因爲打從外難走過，順便化了兩角小洋，到外灘公園去走一趟，吸些比較淸鮮一點的空氣。</p>
<p>然而不進去倒也罷，走了進去，又使我得到也不少悲傷的印象，外灘公園的一切，依然不改昔時的景象，紅的花，綠的樹，分明在告訴我春之神巳降臨了多時，藍眼高鼻的西洋男子，挽着瘦腰肥乳的西洋婦人，直挺的在園中徘徊，園裏的遊人，佔居多數的，當然是我们中國人，男的·女的·老的·小的，他們或她們，面孔上都堆滿了微笑，而正在喁喁談他們的情話。</p>
<p>這些遊人的中間，最是令人注目的，當然是那些崇尙歐化的摩登男女，一對對携着手，並着肩，坐在鐵梗椅上，不是在目挑心許，便是在眺望隔江的景色，當此春盡夏初的時期，和情人在桃紅柳綠之間，遊目聘懷，綿綿情話，自然是一件人生無上的樂事，那裏還想得到閘北被人侵佔，吳淞被人强奪呢？</p>
<p>倚靠在鐵欄杆上，隔一江望去，我們的視線，祇要射到江心，便會看見灰黃色的波浪之中，有幾艘Ｘ國兵艦停泊着，Ｘ國的國旗，正在臨風飄展，艦上滿貯着歡樂的空氣，有的在高唱着勝利的軍歌，不一致的歌聲，由遠處隱約可送進了我的耳鼓，有的在甲板上眺望江邊的一切，他們的視線，有時也許會和園中人接觸，而表露種驕傲的態度，向着我們沒有的中國人嘲笑着。</p>
<p>這是多麽的難堪，多麽的傷心，我的眼淚不由自主的淌下來了，走罷，我眞不願再看這種景象了。</p>
<p>有</p>
<h3>眞歟假歟</h3>
<p>— 無畏</p>
<p>前天我到裏園去吃茶，在我旁的桌上來了三位茶客，聽到他們一番的妙論，不，也許是鬼話，</p>
<p>甲　中日開戰的時候，城隍老爺，和關老爺，岳老爺，都在陰空裏帮忙呀，</p>
<p>乙　哦，怪不得敵人連吃敗仗，………但，你怎樣知道的呀？</p>
<p>甲　我們隔壁乩壇上，純陽祖師臨壇時候說的，……</p>
<p>丙　是呀，打得吃緊時，我到城隍廟去求籤，足有五分多鐘，籤竟不跌出來！……</p>
<p>乙　後來怎樣呢？</p>
<p>丙　後來香夥呌我等一刻，他告訴我，近來城隍老爺極忙，時常外出，……</p>
<p>甲　後來等多少時候呢？</p>
<p>丙　後來足足等了二十分鐘，香夥說來了，並且呌我看城隍老爺額上有許多汗？……</p>
<p>甲　眞的有麽？</p>
<p>丙　自然，我親眼見的呢·</p>
<p>乙　哦，怪不得我内人有一次買了一塊錫箔，幾雙草鞋，說拿到城隍廟去燒，她還說，隔壁婆婆告訴她，城隍老爺托夢給香夥說，要銀子草鞋，我起初還不相信呢，</p>
<p>「…………………」我聽到這裏看天似乎要下雨的光景，也就起身來走了，</p>
<p>不可思議</p>
<h3>一席話</h3>
<p>— 心秀</p>
<p>前星期六晚上，我走訪一個朋友，他的家裏，正聚着幾位朋友，互相談論，淞滬戰後各人的行業狀况，我便坐下，靜靜的聽着，</p>
<p>一位國貨廠布批發所的經理，搖頭縐眉的說道··「眞不得了，我們這些靠着推銷本廠布吃飯的人，眞要餓死了，平常的時候，廠布的銷路，除了那些風氣不甚開通的地方，一般渾金璞玉崇尙樸實的民衆，倒還歡迎外，其餘越是號稱文明的大埠，越是少人過問國貨布疋，但我以爲一般民衆，經過這次痛心的滬變，受了這樣的剌激，我們本廠布的銷路，或可有轉機的希望了，那知還是王老閶那邊生意興隆！」</p>
<p>王老閶笑嬉嬉的答道··「也不見得，不過新進的大批花標，顏色花樣，都很不錯，銷路或可旺些吧，我最羨慕的張先生，那種買賣最好，只要領一張開燈執照，無論市面好壞，一般老槍，總是風雨無阻的天天光顧，這簡直比開米行生意還好，那些失業，沒錢買米燒飯的窮人，只要難爲了幾個銅板，也可胡亂混一餐，倒是這「吃黑飯」的問題，比「吃白飯」要困難得多。發起癮頭來，眞個「如喪考妣」的眼淚鼻涕，十分難過，所以張先生的寳號裏，總是天天嘉賓滿座，利市三倍啊！</p>
<p>張先生却笑着對一位西裝少年道··「生意最發達的，要算貴業了！你看現在全國四萬萬人之中，少講些，倒有兩萬萬人，是吃香烟的，眞是無論富貴貧賤，男女老幼，都普遍到了！若把一年到頭，我們吃香烟的錢，來造一個統計表，牠的總數目，一定大的可驚！和我們敝業比較起來，眞是不可同日而語了。」</p>
<p>書店經理的李先生歡口氣道，「你們大家的生意都好，惟有我這書業，眞是一口苦飯，平時除了一部分言情，愛情，和性的書籍，還有些銷路外，其餘敎科書，文學書，簡直一天到晚，沒人請敎，我們坐在店堂裏，眼看着一般類似學生的西裝少年，摩登小姐，上跳舞場，進電影院，都是過我們而不入—現在我們每日連開銷都不够，如何是好呢？」</p>
<p>大家聽到這裏，都無精打彩的，各自分别回去了。</p>

<h3>飄蕩</h3>
<p>— 渚萊</p>
<p>爲了戰事關係，這飄蕩兩字，很不幸地加在我們的身上了，</p>
<p>本來飄蕩過日，是人生的大不幸，平時在街頭上，看見三三五五的飄蕩者，一方面恨社會事業衰落，不能收容那般年靑的有用的人，一方面以爲他們自甘墮落，所以被社會擯斥，但同時却深深地感到失業的痛苦，因爲他們不幸而失業了，所以化爲飄蕩之流，如果我們的飯碗打碎了，不是和他們一樣嗎，因此徬徨於社會的荆棘道上者莫不懷着飄蕩的恐怖，</p>
<p>在閘北烽火連天的前一天，我本來預備到校裏去上課，但一聞不幸的消息，便怏怏地回到家去，從此以後，整天地飄蕩在綠柳成行的村莊上，飄蕩在黃花靑麥的田畝間，飄蕩在芳草萋萋的大道中，可是如此飄蕩，却也領略一番風味，足以滌除胸中一切的雜念，眞可說是苦中的樂事了，</p>
<p>風聲吃緊了，駕一葉扁舟，到崇明去，飄蕩過二十天，吃過那處異味的菜肴，看過那處有名的勝地，還有崇明的學校，崇明的風俗，都深深地印在我的耳目中，這樣的飄蕩，幾疑身置異國，不知浦江之西巳在日人鐵蹄之下了，</p>

<h3>Assassination of French President Doumer</h3>
<p>By Bin</p>
<p>French President Doumer was suddenly the victim of an assassination attempt the day before yesterday. He succumbed to his injuries yesterday morning around 4 a.m. A head of state perished by a single blow from a petty criminal. This is truly enough to cause endless grief and lamentation among people worldwide.</p>
<p>The inside story of this major case remains without accurate and credible information. According to telegraphic reports, we only know that the assassin is Russian, named Goguloff. His confession claims he is a Russian patriot, admires Mussolini and Hitler, and resents France for assisting the Soviet Union. His assassination of Doumer was intended to force France to oppose the Soviet Union. He also claimed that the son of Lindbergh was also kidnapped by him. The confession is bizarre and erratic, as if from a mentally ill person, or deliberately feigning madness, making it difficult to understand. However, based on our assessment, the background of this shocking global bloodshed is certainly not as simple as Goguloff claims. And there is no need to doubt that Goguloff is not mentally ill.</p>
<p>We believe that Doumer's unfortunate fate stems from no more than the following two causes:</p>
<p>First, a grand international conspiracy. Since the end of the European War, France, relying on the Treaty of Versailles and its superior national strength, has clearly regarded itself as the hegemon of Europe. It has spared no effort in preventing the revival of Germany and Austria, and its treatment of Germany and Austria has been quite severe. France's strength is almost entirely based on the Treaty of Versailles, and what France cherishes is what other countries resent. The defeated nations oppressed by the Treaty of Versailles, their suffering and silent endurance, are situations that the world can imagine. Italy feels threatened by France's realization of pan-European hegemony and is constantly worried. In the context of these international disputes, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no out-of-bounds actions. This is one possibility for the occurrence of this unfortunate event.</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider the situation in the Far East. Recently, tensions have been rising. Japan and Russia are at daggers drawn, awaiting the opportune moment to act. On one hand, calls for a US-Russia alliance are rampant, while on the other hand, rumors of a secret Japan-France pact frequently circulate. In this tense atmosphere, how can we know that sinister individuals will not resort to vicious tactics, implementing their malicious plots of sowing discord, inciting French resentment, and creating a pincer-like situation? The assassination of the Japanese ambassador to Russia a few months ago, its inside story was already worthy of scrutiny. International conspiracies are all-encompassing. This is another possibility for the occurrence of this unfortunate event.</p>
<p>Secondly, the surge of Fascism. Due to the instability and collapse of capitalism, leftist forces are indeed growing stronger day by day, while right-leaning Fascism is also experiencing a sudden resurgence. The rise of militarism and the revival of nationalism are common situations in various countries. Incited by narrow patriotic ideologies, fanatics do not hesitate to unleash their venomous hands, disrupting order, seeking vain fame, and intimidating society. The assassination of Hamaguchi in Japan and the cracking of large-scale assassination plots are precedents. The unfortunate incident in France was thus triggered by such motives.</p>
<p>This is entirely possible.</p>
<p>However, in recent times, the prevalence of assassinations is enough to make people turn pale at the mention of it. In Japan, there was the tragic incident of Hamaguchi, followed by the killings of Inoue and Dan Takuma. Most recently, there was the bombing in Shanghai. In the Soviet Union, there was the assassination plot against Japanese Ambassador Hirota. Recently, in Spain, there was a plot to assassinate the head of state, and the Prime Minister of Egypt narrowly escaped disaster. Now, in France, there is the unfortunate incident of Doumer. Due to economic turmoil, which has further affected political instability, it is all too obvious. When we recall 1914, when the assassination of the Austrian Archduke expanded into a global catastrophe of mutual carnage, we cannot help but feel a sense of impending doom. The past is not far away, and the crisis is stirring again. It is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3>Two Committees Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Joint Committee Held Its First Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Takeover Committee Held an Informal Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Municipal Government Prepares to Form Post-War Reconstruction Committee for War Zones</p>
<p>Following the signing of the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement, Japanese troops began their withdrawal the day before yesterday. As a result, the Joint Committee organized by representatives from China, Japan, and neutral countries, as well as the Takeover Committee for the withdrawal areas designated by the National Government, were both established yesterday to handle all post-war matters. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Joint Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The Joint Committee, organized according to Article 4 of the Armistice Agreement, held its first meeting at 9:45 a.m. yesterday at the American Consulate on Jiangxi Road. U.S. Consul General Cunningham was elected as chairman of the committee, Mr. E. Erland, Secretary of the Consular Body, as secretary, and the allocation of expenses was decided. Finally, the Japanese side reported on the troop withdrawal matters. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Personnel Present Yesterday Those present yesterday included U.S. Consul General Cunningham, Counselor Tredwell; French Consul General Meyrier, Counselor Pennavaria; Italian Chargé d'Affaires First Secretary Rossi, Counselor Fattini, who arrived together at 9:20 a.m. British Consul General Brenan, Counselor Sandilands, also arrived at 9:25 a.m. Next were our committee members, Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, and Municipal Police Bureau Chief Wen Yingxing. Finally were Japanese Consul General Murai, Representative Secretary Okazaki, Counselor Harada, and Committee Secretary E. Erland. The meeting began at 9:45 a.m.</p>
<p>Election of Chairman and Secretary After the meeting, the first order of business was to elect the chairman. The British Consul proposed, and the French Consul seconded, U.S. Consul Cunningham as chairman, which was passed. Mr. E. Erland, Secretary of the Consular Body, was elected as secretary of the Joint Committee.</p>
<p>Committee Expense Issue Next, the committee expense issue was discussed. The friendly nations proposed that the expenses be borne by the six countries. Our committee member Yu Hongjun proposed that they be borne by China and Japan, and the Japanese side expressed no objection. As a result, the committee expenses were to be borne equally by China and Japan, limited to what was resolved by the committee.</p>
<p>Japanese Report on Troop Withdrawal Subsequently, the issue of the Japanese troop withdrawal was discussed. First, the committee members from the friendly nations stood up and stated that when the Japanese troops withdrew, China should be notified in advance to facilitate the takeover and avoid accidents. Japanese committee member Harada then reported on the Japanese troop withdrawal situation, stating that the Japanese troops had already begun their withdrawal on the 6th according to the Armistice Agreement. The main force had withdrawn eastward to the line of Shizilin, Yanghang, Dachang, and Zhenru. Starting from the 6th, within three days, one battalion of infantry stationed in Liuhe, one battalion of infantry stationed in Jiading, and the regimental headquarters and one battalion of infantry stationed in Nanxiang would be completely withdrawn. One battalion of infantry and one company of mountain artillery stationed in Luodian would be withdrawn and handed over to the Chinese police for takeover.</p>
<p>Special Police Issue After the Japanese side reported, they then asked our committee member when the Beiping police would come to Shanghai. Mr. Yu replied that the Armistice Agreement and the Chinese statement did not mention the term "Beiping police," so we only knew of "special police." The Japanese side then stated that the Beiping police were well-trained by foreign advisors. Our side Yu Hongjun then replied that we did not know of foreign advisors, only experts. The committee members from the friendly nations nodded in agreement. It was already 11:30 a.m. The meeting adjourned after a photograph was taken. The date of the second meeting was not determined yesterday.</p>
<p>Establishment of Joint Committee Office After yesterday's meeting, U.S. Consul Cunningham designated a room on the second floor of the consulate as the office of the Joint Committee.</p>
<p>China and Japan Discuss in the Afternoon Regarding the Japanese troop withdrawal after the 3rd, it was decided that the Chinese and Japanese committee members would discuss it directly. If any problems arose regarding the troop withdrawal, etc., one party would report to the committee, and the committee would then convene another meeting to decide on a solution. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., the Chinese and Japanese committee members Yu Hongjun, Wen Yingxing, Okazaki, Harada, and our translator Mr. Wang directly discussed the procedures for the Japanese troop withdrawal, the resumption of traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai and Songhu Railways, and the repair of the railway tracks at the committee office at the American Consulate. Since there were no Japanese troops west of Nanxiang on the railway line, the railway bureau could immediately send workers to repair it. However, east of Nanxiang, it was not possible to repair it. It was immediately decided that the workers would wear a symbol to avoid obstruction. The discussion concluded at 4:30 p.m., and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Takeover Committee</h3>
<p>Regarding the personnel for the Takeover Committee, there was no formal order from the central government arriving in Shanghai as of last night. However, the personnel for the committee had already been internally decided. It was formally established yesterday, with its office located at the Joint Society on West Amherst Avenue. Yesterday afternoon, the committee members held an informal meeting. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Takeover Committee Personnel The personnel for the Takeover Committee were officially announced yesterday, totaling five people. One person from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Guo Dewa. Two people from the Municipal Government: Yin Rugeng, Wen Yingxing. Two people from the Jiangsu Provincial Government: Zhu Xibai, Han Deqin. Yin Rugeng was publicly elected as the director. All of the above people, except for Zhu Xibai, are in Shanghai. Mr. Zhu is also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning to handle takeover matters.</p>
<p>Sub-Committee Takeover Personnel After the establishment of the Takeover Committee, since the Japanese troops in Liuhe, Nanxiang, Luodian, and Jiading are scheduled to completely withdraw to the east of Shizilin, Yanghang, Dachang, and Zhenru starting today, it is necessary to have someone responsible for all the withdrawal areas. Therefore, Pan Zhongjia, the magistrate of Jiading County, was appointed to handle the takeover of Jiading; Shen Ziyun, the chief of the Jiading Public Security Bureau, was appointed to handle the takeover of Nanxiang; Qian Jinpan, the second district chief of Taicang County, was appointed to handle the takeover of Liuhe; and Sun Xiwu, the magistrate of Baoshan County, was appointed to handle the takeover of Luodian. The above personnel are scheduled to depart for their respective locations today. It is also heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has specially appointed Li Mingyang to preside over all matters related to the takeover of troop withdrawals within the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Committee Notifies the Railway Bureau The Takeover Committee for the withdrawal areas, having learned that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line from the front line to Nanxiang is now clear of Japanese troops, and that the entire Beijing-Shanghai Railway needs urgent repairs, specially notified Chen Xinghan, the director of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, yesterday to immediately send workers to expedite the repairs in order to restore traffic as soon as possible. For the section east of Nanxiang, the committee has also consulted with the Joint Committee and agreed that the railway bureau will first send a group of workers, wearing symbols, to proceed with the repairs in order to quickly restore traffic.</p>
<p>Remarks by Yin Rugeng According to Yin Rugeng, the director of the Takeover Committee for the withdrawal areas, who spoke to reporters, the system of this committee is directly under the central government, and it is dedicated to handling takeover matters. Although the target of the Takeover Committee is the Japanese side, all matters are relayed through the Joint Committee. The Japanese troops in the four districts of Nanxiang, Jiading, Liuhe, and Luodian will be completely withdrawn to the east of the first line by noon on the 9th. Therefore, specialized personnel have been appropriately assigned to handle the takeover matters in the above locations separately. The security matters in the withdrawal areas will be taken over by the special police first. Once public order is restored, all administrative, public security, sanitation, and other functions in those areas will be taken over by the local agencies. This committee is of a temporary nature, and it will cease its work once the Japanese troop withdrawal procedures are completed.</p>
<p>Special Police Arrive in Shanghai Guo Taiqi received a telegram from Zhang, the Pacification Commissioner of Beiping, yesterday, reporting that the Beiping police had already departed. However, according to some sources, the Beiping police only departed from Beiping yesterday (the 7th) and are expected to arrive in Pukou in about ten days. Shanghai has already telegraphed the Nanjing authorities, requesting that when the Beiping police arrive in Pukou, they be immediately transported south across the Yangtze River via special train to Nanxiang in order to be dispatched to various locations to maintain public order.</p>
<h3>Signing Date for Agreement Copies</h3>
<p>After the official signing of the English version of the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement, there were still Chinese and Japanese copies that had not been signed. Due to differences of opinion between the two sides regarding the translation, Yin Rugeng and others from our side, along with Okazaki, the secretary from the Japanese side, spent three days at the Japanese Consulate, carefully reviewing and proofreading the copies. Yesterday, they were finally completed, with both sides in complete agreement. According to Yin Rugeng, who spoke to reporters from this newspaper yesterday, the Chinese and Japanese copies have been finalized. However, the signing date has not been determined due to Shigemitsu's serious illness. According to the Japanese side, three possible solutions have been proposed: (1) Wait for Shigemitsu's condition to improve slightly before both sides sign; (2) Guo Taiqi signs first, and Shigemitsu temporarily does not sign, to be signed later; (3) The Japanese government sends someone to sign on behalf of Shigemitsu. The Japanese side has already requested instructions from Tokyo, and a definitive solution is expected next week, it is said.</p>
<h3>Post-War Reconstruction Committee for War Zones</h3>
<p>Regarding the Post-War Reconstruction Committee for war zones being organized by the Municipal Government, it is heard that the number of committee members will be 30, with the directors and councilors of various bureaus of the Municipal Government as ex-officio members and the mayor as the chairman. The remaining members will be appointed by the Municipal Government, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Luo's Statement</h3>
<p>Denies Fourth Annex to Armistice Agreement</p>
<p>The Issue of the Eastern Provinces Will Be Resolved as a Whole</p>
<p>Nanjing, June 6 (Central News Agency) A foreign newspaper reported that there is a fourth annex to the Armistice Agreement. According to Foreign Minister Luo's responsible statement, this is absolutely untrue.</p>
<p>Also, according to diplomatic sources in Nanjing, the Shanghai Armistice Agreement only resolves the issues of ceasefire and troop withdrawal. Other incidents are part of the overall Sino-Japanese problem and must be resolved together with the issue of the Eastern Provinces.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Joint Association Held Representatives' Congress Yesterday</h3>
<p>Opposes the Armistice Agreement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Association of National Salvation Organizations convened its tenth representatives' congress at 3 p.m. yesterday. The organizations present included the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Lawyers' Association, the University Professors' Association, the National Medical Association, the Roads Association, the Anti-Japanese Radical Association, the Jiangxi Association, the Rickshaw Pullers' Association, the Telecommunications Workers' National Salvation Association, the Constitutionalism Association, the National Disaster Relief Association, the Local Self-Government Advancement Association, the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society, the All-Zhejiang Association, the National Disaster Assistance Association, the General Labor Union, the Middle School Teachers' Joint Association, the University Students' Federation, the Taxpaying Chinese Association, the National Endeavor Association, the Education Sector National Salvation Joint Association, the Engineers' Society, the Sichuan Association, the Chaozhou Association, the Anti-Japanese Association of the Five Southeastern Provinces, the Chinese Students' National Salvation Association, and 32 other organizations, with 55 representatives.

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>The purchase of military equipment and other cases were not discussed due to lack of time and were referred to the board of directors for review and handling. The meeting adjourned at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Declaration Issued Since its establishment, this association has repeatedly issued declarations, always adhering to three fundamental principles: (1) The Shanghai issue and the Northeast issue cannot be resolved separately. (2) Japanese troops should withdraw to their home country before negotiations begin. (3) Armed resistance against Japan should be carried out to the end. For months, we have been running around advocating, believing that the government could comply with public opinion and would not sacrifice national sovereignty, plunging our nation into an irrecoverable abyss. Unexpectedly, the government, while publicly proclaiming long-term resistance, secretly engaged in humiliating negotiations, hoping to preserve its strength and consolidate its power, resulting in the establishment of the Shanghai Armistice Agreement. Despite the public's fierce opposition, the government disregarded everything and instructed Guo Taiqi, who had been beaten by the public, to sign the agreement under the strict protection of the foreign concession police. This not only allows the Shanghai issue to be resolved separately, disregarding the Northeast, but also allows Japanese troops to concentrate in the military key areas of Shanghai, on the one hand, gaining the opportunity to withdraw troops northward to destroy our Northeast Volunteer Army, and on the other hand, helping to create a basis for further coercing us into a treaty under duress in the future. This clearly abandons the principle of no negotiations without troop withdrawal. As for the government's so-called long-term resistance against Japan, it is now known to be a complete deception of the people of the country. Therefore, in retrospect of the principles we have always adhered to, this association cannot but fundamentally oppose this humiliating and detrimental agreement. Even in terms of the agreement itself, it contains endless crises, which we would like to explain to our compatriots: First, according to Article 3 of the agreement, the Japanese troops are temporarily stationed in designated locations such as Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinxiang Township, and Zhabei. It does not clearly stipulate a deadline for them to withdraw to the areas of the International Settlement and the extra-settlement roads, while the area from which the Japanese troops withdraw, according to Annex 1 of Article 2, our troops cannot freely move in until a method for restoring normalcy is decided. Our land has been invisibly lost its integrity. Even if the Joint Committee can truly fulfill its responsibilities, how can we guarantee that the Japanese troops, even after withdrawing to the International Settlement and the extra-settlement roads, will not repeat the atrocities of January 28th and infringe upon our land? The agreement may be interpreted as restoring the situation before January 28th, but it is not known that before January 28th, the Japanese troops in Shanghai consisted only of a small number of naval personnel, without this large army. Now, it even acknowledges its stationing of heavy troops in the concession, which is no different from inviting a wolf into the house. Second, according to Article 2 of the agreement, the Chinese troops are to remain in their current positions and can only change their positions after the normalcy of the areas from which the Japanese troops withdraw has been restored and a method has been decided. However, what constitutes the restoration of normalcy and how a method can be decided are major problems. Although our side has stated that the movement of troops is not restricted, it cannot freely move its location under the supervision of the Joint Committee, thus committing the crime of violating the agreement. If there is a large band of pirates or other bandits and disturbances occur in the areas from which the Japanese troops have withdrawn, and our troops cannot attack, then how can the lives and property of the people in that area be protected? Japan repeatedly uses the excuse of protecting its overseas nationals, while we are bound by the agreement and lose the opportunity to protect our people. How can the pain be described? Third, according to Article 4 of the agreement, there are no restrictions on the Chinese police taking over the areas from which the Japanese troops have withdrawn. However, our government voluntarily declares that it is a special police force and will hire experts as officials and instructors. At the same time, according to the Japanese representative, the hiring of experts includes foreigners. Our country's administrative organs have a certain organization and system. For example, Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong have the 4th, 5th, and 7th police districts, and Baoshan and Jiading also have their respective county governments responsible. Since the Japanese troops have withdrawn, our administrative organs should immediately restore the old order and exercise their powers as usual. Now, suddenly establishing a new title and organizing a new organization clearly regards the areas from which the Japanese troops have withdrawn as a special area. If hiring foreign experts is true, then it is even more intentional to sacrifice national sovereignty and give foreigners a handle, which is enough to open the door to international joint administration, and the so-called neutral zone or free city is virtually formed. Fourth, according to Article 1 of the agreement, the point that combat operations around Shanghai are to cease, according to the Japanese representative, includes that Chinese troops are not stationed in the Suzhou Creek and Pudong, which is said to be recorded in the minutes. At the same time, according to Chinese and foreign newspapers, the minutes of the ceasefire meeting do state that areas 20 kilometers outside of Xin Zhuang, Longhua, Huacao, and across from Wusong and Yangshupu are non-stationing locations. Our government has established the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters in Shanghai, which is an important agency for maintaining public order and the lives and property of the people of Shanghai rely entirely on its protection. Now, the Garrison Headquarters is not allowed to exercise its functions in the areas under its jurisdiction, and the non-military related Nanshi and Pudong are not allowed to station troops, which is no different from the humiliating treaties of Dagu Port not being allowed to have fortresses and the area around Tianjin not being allowed to station troops. In short, upon careful examination of the entire text, there are countless places where national sovereignty is sacrificed and the country is humiliated. All our compatriots should unanimously reject it and declare it invalid. And for this kind of measure taken by the government, we must hold them accountable in a just manner. On the one hand, the people must do everything possible to intensify the practical anti-Japanese work, and we will not stop until the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn from our territory and our national administrative power has been fully restored. This is our solemn declaration.</p>
<h3>Opposition to the Agreement from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Huangpu Military Academy National Salvation Corps Telegram: To be forwarded by all newspapers for the public's consideration nationwide. Since the January 28th Incident, due to the government's failure to dispatch reinforcements, the 19th Route Army was forced to retreat completely. In addition to our grief and indignation, we still hoped that the government would turn over a new leaf, uphold an indomitable will, safeguard national interests, and reject the signing of all treaties that would forfeit rights and humiliate the nation. Unexpectedly, the ceasefire agreement actually allows for the cessation of hostilities around Shanghai, which clearly restricts our army from stationing troops in the vicinity of Shanghai. Moreover, the clauses of the agreement delineate Wusong, Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Yinxiang as areas for Japanese troops to be stationed, which explicitly permits Japanese troops to be stationed on our territory. This group vows to oppose the government's willingness to sell out national interests. We hope that compatriots across the country will rise up together to stop the government's treasonous actions. The future of the nation truly depends on this. Respectfully submitted by He Jingmin, Zhu Yecang, Li Tianzhao, Xu Ruiheng, and Tian Zibin, executive committee members of the Huangpu Military Academy Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps, and all 400+ members.</p>
<p>Letter from Ni Yibao and Others: Ni Yibao, Wu Mutang, and He Jingmin question the first article of the ceasefire agreement in a letter to various organizations, stating: Shanghai organizations and compatriots nationwide, the spirits of the Yellow Emperor are failing, and the Central Plains are sinking. The disasters of cyclical years have led to the unprecedented foreign aggression of the September 18th Incident last year. Furthermore, on the 5th of this month and year, the current government authorities signed the so-called humiliating ceasefire agreement with Japan, along with four appendices, or some say three. The Japanese representative also added a statement regarding the meaning of the first article of the agreement: (1) The phrase "cessation of all and various acts of combat" in the first article of the agreement includes the activities of plainclothes teams and all words and deeds that provoke hostile sentiments. (2) Regarding the issue of the stationing of Chinese troops in the area south of the Suzhou Creek and east of the Huangpu River, in addition to the explicit provisions in the first article of the agreement regarding the cessation of hostilities around Shanghai, there is also a record of understanding in the minutes of the meeting, as seen in today's Shen Bao. Alas, sadly, on the morning of the 3rd of this month, at 8:30 AM, when various Shanghai public organizations, national salvation groups, and student representatives requested the public disclosure of the draft agreement at Guo Taiqi's private residence, Guo Taiqi first showed the Chinese draft. Yibao, Mutang, and Jingmin were also among them and raised four points of inquiry regarding the phrase "cessation of hostilities around Shanghai," as reported in the Shanghai Shen Bao on the 4th of this month. Upon investigating the issue of stationing troops in South Shanghai and Pudong, Guo Taiqi had repeatedly made responsible statements, and various newspapers had publicized this. At that time, how was the debate, how was the denial, and there was no further mention of "around Shanghai" in any aspect. Unexpectedly, it was first seen with one's own eyes at Guo's residence. Therefore, repeated questions were raised loudly in public. However, Yin Junzhiling stood next to the table, seemingly intending to stop it and explained it deviously. The next day, at the emergency meeting of the Shanghai United Association of National Salvation Organizations, Li Cishan, Wu Shan, Xie Chengzhong, and others reported that Guo Taiqi stated that "around Shanghai" had been changed to "near Shanghai," which could be satisfactory, as seen in the newspapers on the 5th. Alas, what is it like now? The Japanese side originally proposed South Shanghai and Pudong, and as a result of the debate and denial, it was combined with "around Shanghai." What generosity! The draft seen on the 3rd was "cessation of hostilities," but what is being announced now is a change to "all and various acts of combat." How tireless is it to advance further and further? Humiliation to this extent. Looking at the additional statement from the Japanese side, what will those who debated and denied say now to evade responsibility? Moreover, in addition to the explicit provisions, there is also a record of understanding in the minutes of the meeting. What kind of understanding is the so-called record, and what level of understanding? It is not included in the announcement, but it can be imagined from what is unsaid. For example, unless records of resistance against Japan, boycotts of Japanese goods, and records of atrocities are completely wiped out, it will be impossible to fulfill the agreement. It is indeed as the telegram from the Southeast Three Provinces National Salvation Association says: "The ten characters 'around Shanghai' in the first article of this agreement are the death warrant for around Shanghai" (see the Shishi Xinbao on the 5th of this month). Alas, in the world, what could be more tortuous, accommodating, confusing, and bizarre than this humiliating agreement? It is especially surprising that those who twist and interpret it with satisfaction have such different psychology and vision. Now that the truth is clear, it is too late to reverse it. However, from the standpoint of our people, we should still take calm steps: (1) Demand that the authorities fully publish an image of the complete text of the agreement, all records, attachments, and effective documents to see if this agreement is consistent from beginning to end; (2) Demand that around Shanghai, in addition to military agreements, there be concrete guarantees for all public opinions and national salvation movements, free from all restrictions of the agreement; (3) Based on the strength of our people, just as in the meaning of "each doing their best to the extent of their ability" in the first article of the agreement, we should each seek to preserve our civil rights and the integrity of our territory, vowing that heads may be broken but wills cannot be changed, and the nation cannot be humiliated. Based on the natural rights of humanity, we must strive for necessary movements, be indomitable, never take shortcuts, abandon reliance, be faithful and trustworthy, and exhaust our strength before stopping. Otherwise, life is worse than death, and in the short term, perhaps there is still a place for us to bury ourselves. Alas, respectfully submitted on May 6th by Ni Yibao, Wu Mutang, and He Jingmin.</p>
<h3>Withdrawal of Japanese Troops from Various Locations</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th: An order was issued today to recall one aircraft carrier and four destroyers in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Jiading: Japanese troops implemented a state of emergency at 6 PM on the 5th, prohibiting pedestrians from passing both inside and outside the city. Meanwhile, they forcibly recruited residents to help transport important military equipment, loading dozens of trucks, along with military horses. That night, they departed in two routes: one from outside the East Gate on the Shanghai-Tai Road to Jiangwan, and the other from outside the South Gate on the Jiading-Xiangshi Road to Nanxiang. By the morning of the 6th, only a hundred or so people remained in the city. Pedestrians could pass after being inspected. Regarding the Nanxiang area, withdrawals began on the morning of the 6th, also in two routes to Zhabei: one from the south of the city along the railway and the motor road, and the other from the east of the city via Chendian to the motor road to Zhenru (both routes were newly built by our army during the war). On the same day, Japanese troops from the Lou Tang area were all stationed in the city. Currently, there are no Japanese troops at Landu Bridge, Lou Tang, Shagangmen, Malu, Yuan Situ, Huangdu Station, etc. There were never any Japanese troops stationed at Waigang, Gelong, and Ji Wang Temple. In the Nanxiang area, there are only about a hundred people. However, according to news from the takeover committee, the Japanese troops will not be able to completely withdraw before the 9th. After the 9th, each of the four locations, Nanxiang, Luodian, Jiading, and Liuhe, will need to keep one battalion to guard the baggage. Regarding the local takeover matters, the takeover committee has appointed Jiading County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia and Public Security Bureau Chief Shen Jinghua as Jiading takeover officers, scheduled to accompany takeover committee members Li Mingyang and Han Deqin from Shanghai to Qingpu on the 8th. They will bring Jiading Public Security Bureau police and police teams to Anting on the 9th to liaise with the Japanese troops for the takeover. It is also heard that after the takeover, the Beiping police, who will maintain local order, have been designated by the takeover committee to temporarily station 200 men in Anting and 300 men in Taicang, and they will arrive within a few days.</p>
<p>Suzhou, 7th: Three thousand Japanese troops in Liuhe were moving military supplies on the 7th and will withdraw in the evening. Jiading currently has three thousand troops that have not withdrawn. The Japanese troops in Xintang City, Landu Bridge, and Qi Jing City all withdrew at 3 AM on the morning of the 7th. The Japanese troops in Waigang and Lou Tang withdrew at 11 AM on the 6th. Japanese troops from various locations concentrated over a thousand people in Luodian. Zhu Qingzhao, standing committee member of the Taicang County Party, went to recover lost territory. From Fuqiao and Hupu south to Yanglinkou, all the villages and houses in the Japanese military alert zone have been demolished by the Japanese troops. When the Japanese troops in Xintang City and Qi Jing were about to depart, they engaged in extensive looting.</p>
<p>Changshu, 7th: (1) The enemy in the Landu Bridge area have been retreating towards Liuhe since the 6th. By 1 PM on the afternoon of the 7th, there were no traces of the enemy there, but the fortifications remain. (2) There are still thirty or so enemies in Lou Tang Tang, and they are still on guard at night, perhaps because the troops have not completely withdrawn. (3) The enemy in Jiading retreated to Luodian. The Xintang archway was completely evacuated by 1 PM this afternoon. (4) On the 7th, a portion of the enemy in Liuhe walked to Shanghai, singing military songs along the way, showing a strong desire to return. (5) Currently, there are still over a thousand enemies stationed in Liuhe.</p>
<p>The Wusong Yunzaobiao and Outer Ma Road ferry terminals, which are important transportation hubs by both land and water, originally had Japanese military police who had set up the First and Second Inspection Stations at these two locations to check pedestrians and passengers arriving in Song by city ferries. It is learned that the above two locations were completely withdrawn yesterday, but the signs have not yet been removed.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, villagers from Jiading, Lou Tang, Waigang, Fangtai, Gelong, etc., came to Shanghai and went to the various refugee shelters in western Shanghai, saying that the Japanese soldiers inside and outside Jiading City and in the nearby villages have all withdrawn. They are carrying their wives and children back to their hometowns, so there is a continuous stream of people carrying burdens on their shoulders in groups of three or five, leaving the shelters and returning to their hometowns. However, refugees from Nanxiang, Zhenru, and Jiangqiao, etc., have heard that the Japanese soldiers have not yet withdrawn, so they must wait a little longer, but their hearts are all longing to return home like arrows.</p>

<h3>Jilin-Heilongjiang National Salvation Army Regains Advantage</h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Gathers 40,000 Men to Attack Keshan</p>
<p>National Salvation Army Advances Westward from Mao'er Mountain Towards Harbin</p>
<p>(Harbin) News from various fronts in northern Manchuria today indicates that the Japanese army has not been victorious in several locations. The anti-"Manchukuo" army has now regained the upper hand. Ma Zhanshan has gathered 40,000 men since breaking away from the Changchun New Government. It is said that the military equipment is quite complete. This large army is now attacking Keshan, northwest of Harbin, which is at the end of the railway. At the same time, Ma Zhanshan sent a message to the Chinese army in Hulan, resolutely resisting the enemy and not retreating. The situation in the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway is also becoming more serious. Ashihe, only twenty miles from Harbin, has been occupied by the anti-"Manchukuo" army, and the "Manchukuo" cavalry originally stationed in Ashihe, after being defeated, retreated to Harbin last night, causing considerable panic among the residents here. According to news from the Songhua River, the Japanese army fighting along the river has also not achieved the victory as initially reported. It was initially reported that Fangzheng and Sanxing were both captured by the Japanese army after fierce battles, but it is now heard that the Japanese army has withdrawn to await reinforcements. Wounded Japanese soldiers from the Songhua River area are arriving in Harbin one after another. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Battles Near Harbin</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Chinese army is now advancing westward from Mao'er Mountain and encroaching on Harbin from the north. At a location five miles from Harbin, the Chinese army is fighting with the "Manchukuo" army. Details are unknown, but the anti-"Manchukuo" army is now approaching Harbin, causing great panic here. The Chinese army has gained the upper hand east of Harbin and is now departing towards this direction, seemingly intending to seize Harbin. The Japanese army is mostly operating east of Yimianpo, in the lower reaches of the Songhua River, and several miles west of Harbin. The future depends on whether Ma Zhanshan's troops currently stationed in Hulan are willing to exert effort for Ma. If they are willing to fight for Ma, then the northeast and northwest sides of Harbin will be attacked simultaneously. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Koreans from Acheng Flee to Harbin</h3>

<p>League of Nations Investigation Team Arrived in Jilin Yesterday for Investigation</p>
<h3>Held Talks with Japanese Division Commander Domon</h3>

<p>(Changchun) The League of Nations investigation team departed from Changchun for Jilin at 6 AM today and is scheduled to return to Changchun at 9 PM tonight and then go to Harbin at 9 AM on the 9th. (Dentsu, 7th)</p>

<h3>Lytton and Others Question Komai</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the League of Nations investigation team went to the "Manchukuo State Council" to visit Komai, the Chief of General Affairs. This was the investigation team's final meeting in Changchun. Regarding the fact that there are a disproportionately large number of Japanese in the new government's high-ranking positions, starting with Komai, the investigation team questioned in great detail. Komai answered Lord Lytton's questions about his reasons for taking office as Chief of General Affairs, and General McCoy and Dr. Schiller's questions about the origins of the establishment of the state and the administrative organization. The investigation team left at 5:40 PM. The content of Chief Komai's response was as follows: "For over twenty years, I have been concerned about the affairs of Manchuria. This is the third time I have participated in major Manchurian events. The first time was the Zongshe Party incident in Taisho 5, the second time was the Guo Songling betrayal incident in Taisho 13, and this time is the third time, and I have reached the ideal of establishing a state in Manchuria. Regarding domestic affairs, Manchukuo rejects any national interference, but it adopts the open door policy and equal opportunity as its foreign policy. If one can understand the spirit of this kind of state building, then one can see that the independence of Manchuria is truly a matter of inevitability," and so on. (Dentsu, 7th)</p>
<h3>Puppet Government Allows Gu to Enter</h3>
<p>(Changchun) The "Manchukuo Government" has now formally agreed that Dr. Gu, the Chinese assistant to the League of Nations investigation team, may enter Manchukuo territory, but with the condition of respecting Manchukuo's sovereignty. The previously issued arrest warrant for Gu has now been revoked. The investigation team has now arrived here, and the Manchukuo government has dispatched three assistants to accompany the investigation, including Mr. Ohashi, the former Japanese Consul General in Harbin who is now in charge of external affairs in Manchukuo. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Pose as Representatives of Merchants</h3>
<p>(Beiping) When the investigation team was en route to Changchun, when passing through Gongzhuling, a Japanese police officer posed as a representative of merchants to request a meeting. He appeared quite timid. When Lytton asked questions, his words were disjointed and insincere. It was clear that he was being coerced, and the committee members all laughed it off. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Lytton Is Also Under Surveillance by Japanese Spies</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Shenyang said that when Lytton was in Shenyang, he was walking in the open space in front of the Yamato Hotel one day when he suddenly saw four Japanese spies watching him. Lytton was very displeased. When the Chinese representative went to a bookstore to buy books, the Japanese spies followed him. When he wanted to buy books about the Northeast Incident, he was forced not to sell them. The number of people the Chinese representative took to Changchun was all decided by the Japanese side. There were those who were blocked from leaving on the first day they were ready to depart. A formal report has been made and it is scheduled to be drafted in Beiping. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Interfere with Representatives Meeting Guests</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, a foreign newspaper reporter came to Beiping from Changchun and said that since the League of Nations investigation team arrived in Changchun, the Japanese surveillance has been even stricter than it was in Shenyang, especially towards the Chinese representatives. Their actions are not free at all. Many Chinese who visit them are arrested. Even when foreign advisors go out, plainclothes Japanese police officers forcibly accompany them, as if escorting them. In the afternoon of the 3rd, when Gu Weijun was meeting with two American priests at home, five or six Changchun Japanese police officers suddenly pushed the door open and barged in, firmly asking what the guests were talking about. Their attitude was strong and unreasonable. Gu refused to tell them. Just then, Lytton's secretary, Haas, came to visit and was very angry at the situation, rebuking them sternly. The police even asked if the representatives had obtained permission from the police department to meet guests, and that all Manchurian people must first apply to the police department before visiting. Haas then told them that the representatives' meeting with guests had been permitted by Committee Chairman Lytton and that the police department had no right to interfere, and they then left. Afterwards, Gu prepared a document to the investigation team, asking them to forward a protest to the Japanese side, requesting that the representatives' freedom to meet guests be guaranteed.

<h3>Guangdong Naval Generals Send Telegram to Support Chen Ce</h3>
<p>In Order to Avoid Chen Jitang's Violent Oppression</p>
<p>The Fleet Was Moved to Tang Bay in Qiongya</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangdong naval generals Chen Ding, Jin Yanwen, Chen Qingyun, and twenty-odd captains of the Zhongshan Flying Eagle, etc., sent a telegram from Tangjia Bay on the 5th, first stating that because of the violent Japanese oppression, they know that without unity, there is no way to save the country, so they sent a telegram last year, not participating in the civil war, and sharing the national crisis. Next, they blamed Chen Jitang for holding onto his troops, deliberately eliminating the navy, shelling our ships, and imprisoning our officers, willing to be the leader of internal strife, and shifting the blame to the Southwest Political Council. His current horizontal oppression of this army is the same as his previous private disposal of the air force. In Chen Jitang's mind, does he still have the National Government and the Political Council? They vow to sincerely support General Commander Chen of this army to implement the advocacy of external opposition to strife. To avoid Chen Jitang's violent oppression, the fleet was moved to Tang Bay in Qiongya to welcome General Commander Chen to come to the army and preside over it. If Chen Jitang is enlightened and supports the central government in resisting Japan, they will release all previous grievances. Otherwise, they will only know how to uphold justice and deal with each other. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Sends Three Warships to Zhaoqing</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) On the day after the Humen Incident occurred, Chen Jitang sent a telegram to Yang Dezhao, the representative stationed in Beijing, ordering him to visit Sun Ke in Shanghai to explain the truth of the matter. Yang flew to Beijing yesterday morning. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang's Power Becomes More Consolidated</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Judging from news from Guangzhou, the abolition of the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Guangzhou Air Force has consolidated the power of Chen Jitang, the military leader of Guangdong Province. Since the establishment of the Guangzhou National Government, the Guangzhou Air Force has been independent. Although the Guangzhou National Government no longer exists, and Nanjing has ordered that provinces not use the title of Commander-in-Chief, the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force has not been abolished. The appointment of Huang Guangrui as Air Force Commander to replace Zhang Huichang has now been realized without resistance. Huang is the Chief of Staff and leader of the fleet and is a close friend of Chen Jitang. Therefore, the Guangzhou Air Force has now become a part of the Guangdong Provincial Army and is no longer an independent entity. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Requests Leave to Mediate the Guangdong Situation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Mingshu has requested a week's leave to mediate the Guangdong situation and plans to go to Shanghai within a few days to hand over departmental affairs, which will be handled by Chen Fumu in his absence. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Mingshu made the following statement today:</p>
<p>(1) According to Chen Bonan's latest report, the resolution of the Guangdong naval incident has not been fully completed. The air force is no longer a problem. The future situation is unlikely to escalate. The deployment of troops in Guangxi is to assist in suppressing the communists and there is no other intention.</p>
<p>(2) The saying that Mr. Sun Zhesheng invited Mr. Wang and Mr. Jiang to Hangzhou to discuss national affairs seems to have subsided recently. It is difficult to predict whether it will be realized in the future.</p>
<p>(3) Commander-in-Chief Jiang has long been suffering from illness and had applied for rest before the Shanghai Sino-Japanese incident occurred. However, because of his eagerness to resist Japan, he forced himself to go to war. Now that the Sino-Japanese issue has come to an end and his body is in urgent need of rest, he has once again expressed his desire to resign, but it has not been approved. As for the saying that Military Commander Cai has resigned, there is no such thing. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Huang Bingheng Talks About the Lack of Escalation of Guangdong Affairs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Director of the Aviation Administration Huang Bingheng said that the Guangdong air and sea affairs are because the Eighth Route Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang is consolidating and maintaining the strength of the central government, so he has taken such measures. Although the navy was at Humen and there was a forty-minute standoff, it has been pacified. The air force has no problems. This matter will not escalate. This time I have returned to the department to take up my duties to (1) add more hangars, (2) increase enrollment and hire more American professors to specialize in training after the aviation school moves to Hangzhou, and (3) the Commanders-in-Chief of the three provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong to suppress the reds have already embarked on their journey west.

<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Affairs Committee believes that the telegram from Xiao Focheng and others opposing the ceasefire agreement is merely issuing irresponsible high-sounding statements because Chen Jitang and Li Zongren, who are factually responsible in the two Guangs, are absolutely clear about the central government's actions.

The letter to He stated that there are nineteen regiments entering Jiangxi and that before the central government has an overall joint suppression plan, they plan to thoroughly suppress the local communists in southern Jiangxi, striving to stabilize one county at a time. Those entering Fujian will still follow the original plan, attacking Shanghang, Yongding, and Zhangzhou, but they hope that the joint suppression plan will be promulgated quickly, etc. The letter to Xiong stated that the situation in southern Jiangxi is currently like a prairie fire, so they have decided to clear and suppress on one hand and reorganize on the other, with Li Zhenqiu serving as the Director of the Southern Jiangxi Highway Office to handle road administration in seventeen counties. This trip vows not to take a single blade of grass or tree from southern Jiangxi. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Zhao Pilian Arrives in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Negotiate Troop Reduction on Behalf of Yan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Yan Xishan, Director of Pacification of Shanxi, took office, it was deemed necessary to report to the Central Government on the issue of troop reduction. Therefore, he dispatched Zhao Pilian as his representative to Beijing to establish an office. Zhao arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 7th and is scheduled to meet with Chiang on the 8th to report on everything. Zhao told reporters that the political situation in Shanxi Province is unstable this year, and there is no financial solution. After Yan returned to the province, he first reduced the number of troops. The reorganization has been completed, and there are currently seven divisions of infantry, one division each of cavalry and artillery, totaling 100,000 men, with over 20,000 men being eliminated. In the past, military expenditure required more than two million per month, with a monthly deficit of one million after provincial treasury payments. After the reduction, there is still a shortfall of 600,000 yuan, and efforts are being made to make up the difference. As for internal affairs, due to the impact of years of military affairs, they have become increasingly chaotic. It has been decided to comprehensively reorganize and establish a Provincial Administration Design Committee to gather talent and improve provincial and county affairs.

<h3>Chen Shaokuan Resigns as Minister of the Navy</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shaokuan resigned as Minister of the Navy. The original memorial stated that since the "September 18th Incident" last year, when the Japanese invaded and occupied the three northeastern provinces, he dared not act freely because he had not received orders from the Central Government. Outsiders are unaware of this, making it difficult to explain. Furthermore, the intellectual class does not adhere to the facts, making reckless and defamatory attacks, even resorting to arbitrary slander to achieve poisonous political purposes. The Shanghai Incident has now been signed and contracted, and the naval vessels are old and cannot consolidate national defense. When a crisis comes, there will be no ability to resist insults. Rather than being bound and slandered, it is better to retire immediately to make way for the capable, thereby silencing the critics. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Executive Yuan Responds to the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan responded to the Legislative Yuan on the 6th, stating in brief: "The postal rate increase is of the same nature as the railway freight rate increase.

<h3>French President Doumer Dies</h3>
<p>The People of Paris Are Shocked by This Tragedy</p>
<p>The Remains Will Be Buried in a State Funeral on Thursday</p>
<p>The President of the Senate Temporarily Assumes Presidential Powers</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th: French President Doumer succumbed to his injuries and passed away at 4:40 this morning. His family and ministers such as Taittinger were by his side. At dawn, his body was moved to the presidential palace. The French cabinet convened a special meeting this morning to discuss the state funeral and the convocation of parliament at Versailles to elect a successor president. The whole world was shocked and angered by the news of the assassination of the French president. Dignitaries from various countries telegraphed Paris to express their sympathy. In addition to grief and indignation, French newspapers unanimously expressed the opinion that France accommodates too many insidious foreigners. British newspapers detailed the assassination and offered criticism, expressing their grief and sorrow, calling Doumer a good friend of Britain and a loyal servant of France, and recounting the loss of his four sons in the Great War. The previous French president assassinated was Carnot, in 1894, at Lyon.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th: At dawn today, the police chief announced outside the Beaujon Hospital, "Gentlemen, the President has just passed away." The scene was extremely tragic. Then, the President's wife led her two daughters out in tears. Someone then carried a yellow litter covered with a white cloth. Following them was General Tracouani, head of the President's military household, carrying Doumer's remains to the presidential palace. The people waiting outside the courtyard all removed their hats in tears and stood silently on both sides to let it pass. The people of Paris were shocked by this tragedy, and almost all businesses were suspended today. Countless merchants and workers gathered outside the presidential palace early in the morning. The body is now being embalmed. After that, the public will be allowed to pay their last respects to this benevolent white-bearded old man of France. According to the constitution, parliament must convene immediately to elect a successor president, but since tomorrow is the second round of voting in the election, it will not convene before Tuesday. Judging from the situation, Senate President Lebrun is likely to be elected without opposition. What impact this tragic death will have on the general election cannot be measured at present. However, since everyone regards the murderer as a madman, even if there is an impact, it will be minimal. It is still uncertain whether the members of parliament attending the convening of parliament will be the old members or the new members, as there is no precedent to follow.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th: The late President Doumer will have a state funeral at Notre Dame Cathedral, scheduled for May 12 and buried in the Pantheon. No one had been buried there since the death of President Carnot, who was also assassinated in 1894. On that day, the national theater and public offices will be closed, and the whole country will fly flags at half-mast to express mourning. Civil and military officials will observe mourning for one month. On the afternoon of Sunday, the remains will be displayed in the grand hall of the presidential palace. Today, all theaters in the country have suspended performances to show respect. The famous writer Frélaut, who was shot twice while trying to seize the murderer's weapon, has had one bullet removed, while the other bullet remains in his body. He cannot sleep peacefully at night and is in a precarious state.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 7th: President Doumer passed away this morning due to his injuries. The powers of the President are temporarily assumed by the President of the Senate. Members of parliament have generally stated that the lack of a vice president in the French constitution is a real regret.</p>
<h3>The Circumstances of the Assassination at the Venue</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th: According to eyewitnesses at the venue, the murderer, Gorguloff, wore dark glasses and asked the famous writer Frélaut to sign his name on three books. Frélaut agreed. President Doumer then stepped forward to greet Frélaut. At this moment, gunshots rang out, and the President fell to the ground unconscious. The Minister of Defense and the Police Chief quickly grabbed the assassin and took away his gun. The general audience initially suspected that the gunshots were the sound of a flashbulb exploding, but then a woman holding a book stained with blood ran out of the venue and exclaimed, "They are killing people!" The assassin was surrounded by an angry crowd and would have been beaten to death without police intervention. When the assassin was taken to the police station, he raised his hands to the sky in prayer, and the crowd still shouted wildly, "Kill the assassin!" The police have now detained a Swiss woman from Monaco who once lived with Gorguloff and brought her to Paris for questioning. The chairman of the Russian Emigrant Committee in France has issued an article expressing the committee's indignation at this act of violence. The police believe that Gorguloff's claim that he opposed communism may be an intentional deception. The backlash from the political violence of the Russian fascists may have a great impact on the second election on Sunday. Even if Gorguloff is indeed mentally ill, his crime may still implicate the Russian émigrés who have taken refuge in Paris and throughout France.</p>
<h3>Comatose All Night</h3>
<p>Succumbing to Injuries</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 7th: Doumer was only conscious for four minutes before and after being assassinated. The rest of the time he was comatose and groaned incessantly. Doctors administered morphine from time to time, but the pain did not subside, so he did not leave a will. After the news of Doumer's death was announced, the police immediately stated that they would charge the murderer Gorguloff with first-degree murder.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 7th: French President Doumer was in critical condition after being attacked yesterday. At 2:30 this morning, doctors reported that the President had entered a coma. At 10:00 last night, doctors reported that his temperature was 37.2 degrees Celsius and his condition remained extremely serious. At 5:41 last night, doctors reported that the President had one bullet wound, one at the base of the skull and one in the right chest. The bleeding had stopped, but the situation was extremely serious. Two blood transfusions had been performed. He is now in a coma. It is said that the bullet that penetrated the neck went deep behind the ear and stopped in a glandular substance, which is in a very dangerous position. It is also said that the shoulder artery was ruptured by the bullet, so the bleeding did not stop. After surgery to stop the bleeding at 7:15 last night, it started bleeding again at 7:45, and a third blood transfusion was performed at 9:10. At that time, his condition seemed to have improved slightly, but he fell into a coma again at midnight.</p>
<h3>The Murderer's Bizarre Confession</h3>
<p>Claiming to Be a Russian Fascist</p>
<p>A Diary Was Found in His Pocket</p>
<p>Feigning Madness? Mental Derangement?</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 7th: The murderer, Gorguloff, is still in the police station near the scene of the incident, heavily chained and interrogated overnight by the authorities. The man is a patriot, with the fantasy of becoming a Russian Mussolini or Hitler. He claims to be the creator and president of the Russian Fascist Party. He returned to Paris from Monaco on Wednesday to personally assassinate Doumer because France and other European countries and the United States were assisting Soviet Russia and providing money, which was harming Russia. He also muttered to himself that France and the United States were the great enemies of Russia. He also said that he had no personal hatred for Doumer and had no intention of harming him at first, but when he saw France preparing to join hands with Soviet Russia, he took this action to make France declare war on the communists. He also claimed that this was entirely his own doing and had no accomplices. However, his confessions were inconsistent and often discontinuous. He also claimed to be the president of the Russian Fascist Republican Democratic Party, because France had already been red-ified, just like the United States had become a great enemy of past and future Russia, so he took this action. Gorguloff is a White Russian who yearns for his homeland and has gone mad. He is 37 years old, a medical practitioner, and came to Paris two years ago. He was very active among the White Russians at one point and was deported from Czechoslovakia for inciting everywhere. He came to Paris from Monaco this time, and his wife is still in Monaco and has been arrested. The police are investigating whether there are any accomplices.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 6th: The murderer who assassinated President Doumer was neatly dressed. In the police station, he confessed that he was a Russian patriot and said, "I know you will kill me, but I am doing what I have to do, it is my responsibility. I greatly admire the character of Hitler in Germany and Mussolini in Italy, but I have never received their assistance." The assassin's name is Gorguloff. In his pocket, there was a blue diary with the inscription "The confession of Gorguloff, the killer of the French President." Gorguloff was born in Rabenskaya in 1895. According to him, the reason he killed the French President was because France was aiding Bolshevism and the West was subsidizing Soviet Russia to promote Bolshevism. Gorguloff also claimed to be the former chairman of the Russian Fascist Party and came from Monaco to assassinate the French President. Gorguloff studied medicine in Brussels.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th: The diary found in Gorguloff's pocket contained words such as "I will kidnap Lindbergh's child and educate him to become a Russian terrorist." Three psychiatrists are currently examining the assassin. Official sources say that it is still doubtful whether Gorguloff is feigning madness, but it has been determined that he formerly belonged to the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>National Government Sends Condolences</h3>
<p>Reuters, Nanjing, 7th: Chairman Lin of the National Government and Foreign Minister Luo have both telegraphed the French government to express condolences on the death of President Doumer. Upon receiving Reuters' telegram reporting the President's attack, Foreign Minister Luo immediately telegraphed the Chinese Embassy in Paris, ordering them to express condolences on behalf of the National Government and wish him a speedy recovery.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 6th: The news of President Doumer's assassination spread like wildfire, shocking the world. King George V of England immediately telegraphed Mrs. Doumer and Taittinger to express his condolences. French Ambassador to England, Froulliveau, a close friend of the President, went to Buckingham Palace in the afternoon to pay his respects to the King and was immediately received. German President Hindenburg and Prime Minister Brüning also telegraphed the French government. Berlin newspapers published special editions to report the assassination. The Spanish government, wishing to await news, ordered the Chamber of Deputies to delay its meeting by one hour. When the news arrived in Geneva, the Committee on Defense Expenditures of the Disarmament Conference was in session. At the suggestion of the German representative, the meeting was adjourned to express shared indignation.</p>

<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th: According to the official gazette, President Doumer presided over a cabinet meeting yesterday and decided to promote the French Minister to China, Wilden, to first-class minister. This was Doumer's last official act.</p>
<h3>The Life of Doumer</h3>
<p>Served in Important Positions During His Lifetime</p>
<p>Four Sons Died in the European War</p>
<p>President Doumer was born on February 22, 1856, in Aurillac, studied law, and after graduation, soon became the secretary of Mr. Floquet, the Speaker of the House of Representatives. He was then elected as a member of the House of Representatives. From 1897 to 1902, Doumer was the Governor-General of French Vietnam. After leaving office in 1902, he returned to France and re-entered the House of Representatives, serving as Speaker of the House from 1905 to 1906. In 1912, he was elected as a Senator for Corsica and was re-elected in each subsequent term. During the European War, he was entrusted with important tasks in Russia. From 1917 to 1926, he joined several cabinets. When Briand was Prime Minister, Doumer was the Minister of Finance. In 1927, Doumer was elected as the President of the Senate. On May 13, 1931, he was elected as the 13th President of France. This year, he is 76 years old. Doumer was a member of the left-wing Democratic Party. All four of his sons died in the European War, and the French people mourned them, naming a street "The Four Sons of President Doumer" to commemorate them forever. Doumer wrote many books, including one specifically about Vietnam. Mr. Fallières, who was injured at the same time as the President, was formerly a naval officer. After retiring, he engaged in writing novels and enjoyed a high reputation in the French literary world, having written many novels about the Far East. (Havas News Agency)</p>

<h3>Chinese Staff of the League of Nations Investigation Team Returns to Beiping</h3>
<p>Heavily Monitored in Shenyang</p>
<p>Journey to Changchun Also Restricted</p>
<p>Forced to Return in Two Batches</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The League of Nations Investigation Team departed from Shenyang by special train for Changchun the day before yesterday (the 2nd). Due to restrictions imposed by the Japanese, the Chinese representatives who accompanied them were limited to Gu Weijun, secretaries Yang Chengji and Shi Zhaokui, specialized committee members Liu Chongjie and Chen Liting, and consultant Ho Ping-yin, a total of seven people. The rest returned south in two batches on the 30th of last month and the 2nd of this month. The first batch, consisting of hospitality director Yan Enjun, secretary Yang Jingbin, committee members Liu Guangpei, Gu Zhizhong, and Xie Enzeng, arrived in Dalian on the evening of the 1st. Liu Guangpei temporarily stayed in Dalian due to business, and boarded a ship from Dalian directly back to Shanghai. Gu Zhizhong, Yang Jingbin, and Xie Enzeng arrived in Tianjin on the 2nd. Gu and Yang took the Jinpu train back to Shanghai on the 3rd, and Xie returned to Beiping at 12:10 AM on the 3rd. In addition, people such as Ge Gongzhen, Bao Jingan, and Chen Yichun should arrive in Beiping today or tomorrow, barring any delays en route. It is heard that after the investigation team arrived in the Northeast, they were closely monitored by the Japanese, and the Chinese representatives were treated with particular discourtesy. When taking the special train from Dalian to Shenyang, the rooms prepared on the train allocated Lord Lytton and the committee members to the foremost carriages, while the Chinese representatives were placed in the last, with the Japanese representatives in the middle, to isolate them and prevent contact between our representatives and the investigation team. After arriving in Shenyang, the Japanese immediately claimed to have prepared rooms in the Yamato Hotel, but only booked four rooms for the twenty-odd Chinese representatives, forcing our representatives to mostly find accommodation in the Orient Hotel. However, all room and board expenses, even for the rooms they booked, were paid by our representatives themselves. The day after arriving in Shenyang, a large number of Japanese detectives were dispatched to separately monitor the personnel, with two detectives monitoring one person, and four detectives monitoring those of slightly greater importance. The movements of our representatives were particularly difficult, with detectives closely following them whenever they went in or out. If they conversed with local friends on the street or had any interaction, their friends would be arrested immediately. When the investigation team left Shenyang for Changchun, our representatives originally intended to go with them, but due to repeated refusals from the Japanese, they were limited to only six people accompanying Gu Weijun. Those who could not go with them originally intended to wait in Shenyang until the team returned to Shenyang, and then return to Beiping together. However, the Japanese again strongly opposed this, claiming that if a part of our representatives were in Shenyang, it would still be a nuisance to monitor them. The team had no choice but to take a detour through Dalian and return south in succession. The investigation team's work in Shenyang, apart from five talks with Honjō, did not involve meeting with any Chinese officials. Therefore, apart from interviews with consuls from various countries and foreign merchants, the materials obtained were rarely more accurate. Lytton had very much wanted to talk to Zang Shiyi, but the Japanese did not want Zang to meet with the investigation team alone, so it did not happen. In addition, there were also Han Chinese traitors posing as representatives of merchants and farmers who visited the investigation team, all making statements flattering to the Japanese. One day, Lytton planned to go to Beiling to play golf, and the Japanese, upon hearing this, hired a large number of hoodlums, giving each of them five Japanese yen and holding small petition flags, waiting at Beiling. As a result, Lytton was unable to go due to business, and the Japanese's farcical trick did not succeed. (4th)</p>
<h3>May Fifth Memorial Meeting in Luoyang</h3>
<p>Lin Sen: The Meaning of "The World is for All"</p>
<p>Jiao Yitang: Restoring Inherent Civilization</p>
<p>Ju Zheng: Long-Term Resistance Will Surely Lead to Victory</p>
<p>Luoyang News: On the 5th, the National Government held a May Fifth Memorial Meeting, and Chairman Lin and others gave speeches, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>Lin Sen: Briefly stated, today is May 5th, which is the anniversary of the Premier taking office as the Extraordinary President in Guangzhou in the tenth year of the Republic. Today, we are holding a memorial meeting here, recalling the situation of the Premier's inauguration on that day, which was realized after many twists and turns and many difficulties. Because at that time, many people did not understand the meaning of the Premier's inauguration, they held opposing views. In fact, the only will of the Premier at that time was to unify China, actively launch the Northern Expedition, remove the obstacles to the revolution, and consolidate the foundation of the Republic of China. Based on this will, the Premier launched the Northern Expedition as the first step after taking office as Extraordinary President, hoping to implement his proposition of true unification, without any selfishness or consideration of rights in between. This point can be clearly seen from the fact that the Premier ceded his position to Yuan Shikai in the first year of the Republic. When the Premier took the position of Provisional President in the first year of the Republic, he ceded his position to Yuan Shikai because the policy was fundamentally unworkable. At that time, many comrades did not understand the Premier's meaning and advised him against it, because at that time, a part of the armed comrades in the north and a part of the non-comrade soldiers all expressed support for the republic, and it was not necessary to cede the position to Yuan. However, the Premier believed that if his ambitions could not be realized and the republic had someone to support it, then success did not have to be achieved by himself, and he eventually ceded the position of President. This shows the Premier's great public-spiritedness. From this point, we can see that the Premier's taking the position of Extraordinary President was not to increase his own position in any way. His concession to Yuan Shikai in the first year and his taking office as Extraordinary President in the tenth year, although the situation was different, the spirit was consistent, that is, entirely for the sake of the public, wanting to seek unification for the country and benefit for the people. Many people did not understand his painstaking efforts of not hesitating to sacrifice and not shirking labor. Today, among the comrades present, there are also those who know this situation, who know the various pains and twists and turns of that year. Therefore, on today's anniversary, we should recall that the Premier's indomitable spirit that year was entirely selfless and for the country and the people. Now is the time when the national situation is very serious. How should we reflect deeply, how should we fully understand, and how should we strive to implement the legacy shown by the Premier during his lifetime, so as not to fail the meaning of today's memorial?</p>
<p>Jiao Yitang: Briefly stated, today's May Fifth Festival is the anniversary of the inauguration of the Constitutional Protection President in Guangzhou. The establishment of a country is entirely dependent on law. Without law or without obeying the law, there is no country. After the establishment of the Republic of China, there was originally law, but because people often destroyed the law, it has led to years of internal strife, and now it has formed a major national crisis, leading to the relocation of the capital to Luoyang and the relocation of the secondary capital to Xi'an. In the future, we must not only abide by the law to stabilize the foundation of the country, but also revive the country by restoring the inherent civilization of China, as the Premier said. We must learn from the meaning of Duke Zhou's instruction to King Cheng to train the people, to organize local self-government at the lower level, to quickly restore the Zhou rites, and to use the Wu, Liang, Zu, Lü, Shi, and Jun system to organize people. When the country is in trouble, this can be used as an army, and when there is no trouble, it can be used for farming. We should use the Zhou Dynasty's system of state, party, clan, village, and neighborhood to organize families, on the one hand, to encourage people to produce, and on the other hand, to force people to produce. This kind of inherent civilization is indeed the foundation of governing the country and the raft of self-government, and should be vigorously implemented. Furthermore, the officials of the Zhou Dynasty were not called Baiguan but called Baigong, and the salaries of the officials were equal to the income of the farmers, so the official style was not arrogant and the people were content with their work. This is also worth borrowing from. Now that the national crisis is serious, everyone should firmly adhere to the legacy and strive for the country, so as not to fail the Premier's lifelong advocacy of abiding by the law to serve the country and restoring the inherent civilization.</p>
<p>Ju Zheng: Briefly stated, the Premier's taking the position of Extraordinary President that year was not a matter of increasing his own position, but to shoulder the responsibility that should be taken for transforming the country. The Premier's policy at that time was to advocate the Northern Expedition in the military to seek national unification, and to advocate equal rights and decentralized governance among the provinces in politics, because China is vast and populous, and if the powers of each province are centralized in the central government, there will definitely be many inconveniences in governance. Therefore, the Premier strongly advocated equal rights and decentralized governance among the provinces, but in reality, it was to return to unification. After he took office as Extraordinary President, he immediately sent troops to Hunan to launch the Northern Expedition. Coincidentally, at that time, the Hunan Provincial Assembly had a system of self-selecting the provincial governor, and the Premier thought it was feasible, so he wanted to promote this system to all provinces in order to accelerate the realization of people's governance. This is the first point. Secondly, at that time, there were many troops in various provinces, and the Premier wanted to find a way to absorb this excess amount of troops, so he created the engineering corps system and the militia system, such as the ancient Tuntian system, to gradually transform all the troops into industrial and agricultural workers. In addition, there were also detailed plans and explanations for local autonomy, the main purpose of which was entirely based on people's ownership, governance, and enjoyment, and he wanted to unify China without using force. This is the second point. All this shows the Premier's dedication to the country and his responsible spirit. His resolute taking of the position of Extraordinary President on this day in the tenth year of the Republic was also for this reason. Today, we are holding a memorial here, unfortunately just in the period of national crisis, which makes us feel infinitely saddened. However, we must clarify this issue with Japan. If we do not determine a proper policy for future relations with Japan, the harm will be incalculable. I believe that if we can persist in long-term resistance in the future, the final victory will surely belong to us, because Japan is a small country with a large population, limited food, and the domestic situation is extremely complicated. The intellectual and economic circles are exposing an unadjusted state everywhere. In terms of its economy, Japan's national expenditure reaches 1.7 billion yuan per year, or at least 1.6 billion yuan, while on the revenue side, taxes account for only a very small part, and most of it relies on donations from the surpluses of industry and commerce. If our country can engage in long-term resistance with it, Japan will be greatly affected. Therefore, our country's resistance to Japan now does not lie in temporary military struggles, but in long-term resistance. I hope that comrades will make up their minds together to prepare for resistance and realize resistance.</p>
<h3>Exemption of Export Duties on Raw Silk from Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>The Government Agrees to Subsidize 100 Taels of Promotion Expenses per Picul</p>
<p>In recent years, the silk and cocoon industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has increased exports through improved silkworm breeding. Unexpectedly, the purchasing power of Europe and the United States is weak, and the price of Japanese silk has fallen. China is suffering from natural and man-made disasters, and people cannot even afford to buy cloth, let alone silk. Therefore, this year's stock of raw silk has reached more than 20,000 piculs, and the stock of silkworm cocoons has reached 100,000 stones. If we do not find ways to promote sales, it will be even more difficult to sell the new spring cocoons. Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and He Yushu, Director of the Department of Industry, went to Beijing twice to negotiate an increase in the import tax on rayon and the abolition of the export tax on Chinese natural silk, in order to seek a fundamental solution. It is now heard that Mr. He telegraphed from Beijing to the province that the export tax exemption has been obtained, and the government will subsidize 100 taels of promotion expenses per picul of raw silk. The cocoon market in the Suzhou-Wuxi area has shown signs of activity upon receiving this news. This is the most valuable measure taken by the Jiangsu Provincial Government since its reorganization in terms of people's livelihood, which can increase the production of farmers in the entire Jiangnan area and a part of Jiangbei. However, the increase in the import tax on rayon still needs to be discussed.</p>

<p>Fire Outside Guangfu Gate Kills Two Children (Wuxi Correspondence) Yang A'er, owner of the Hexing firewood store outside Guangfu Gate, on the east side of the city, and the upstairs residents Liu Desheng and Jin Guisheng had a fire at around 4:00 AM yesterday (the 5th) due to carelessness. Suddenly, a fire broke out, and thick smoke filled the roof, spreading to the Zhenxiang Hardware Store warehouse next door. The fire was extinguished after the fire brigades from various sections drove to the scene and tried their best to rescue it. When the fire was raging, Liu Desheng's two-year-old son and Jin Guisheng's nine-year-old daughter were unable to be rescued and died in the fire. The total loss is estimated to be more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Thief Jumps Off a Vehicle and Escapes (Wuxi Correspondence) Lu Deguan, a villager near Anzhen in the eighth district of the county, was killed by bandits last year, and his body was buried to cover up the traces. Later, Zhu Meiji, the security chief of the district, captured three bandits, Wang Xiaomei, Pan Fulang, and Du Xiaoer, and recovered Lu's remains. The county court sentenced Wang Xiaomei to death, and Pan Fulang and Du Xiaoer to twelve years of imprisonment each. Wang Xiaomei refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Suzhou High Court. Yesterday (the 5th) at around 7:00 AM, three bailiffs from the Wuxi County Court, Zhao Chengyu, Zhou Fuzhen, and Hu Ren, took a vehicle in Suzhou to escort Pan Fulang, Du Xiaoer, and two other human trafficking suspects to Wuxi. When the vehicle was about to arrive at the Wuxi station, the bandit Pan suddenly jumped out of the hole and escaped without a trace. Bailiff Zhao and others were unable to pursue him and reported to Chief Prosecutor Zhou Erkai for handling. After Zhou opened the court, he ordered the arrest of Zhao and the other two and ordered the officers to arrest the fugitive.</p>
<p>Multiple Deaths by Drowning at Yiling Broken Bridge (Yangzhou Correspondence) Yiling Town, located in the eastern countryside of this county, holds a market once a year on the 28th day of the third month of the lunar calendar, as well as a god-welcoming and competitive event, which is extremely lively. Yesterday (the 3rd) was another meeting day, and pedestrians came and went, shoulder to shoulder. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon of that day, the bridge in the town suddenly broke due to the large number of pedestrians, and more than a hundred people fell under the bridge at that time. After the various agencies in the town tried to salvage the people, many were rescued, but not a few drowned. After the Jiangdu County Government received the news, it believed that the chief of the public security bureau of the town did not prevent the event in advance and did not take precautions against danger in time, which was truly inexcusable. It specially ordered Chen Xun of the Public Security Bureau to severely punish him and sent Construction Chief Xiao Zicai to investigate and review the matter.</p>
<p>Fire at the God of Wealth Temple (Ningbo Correspondence) The God of Wealth Temple on the north bank of the Yong River has been built for more than 200 years and is a large building in northern Yong. The Yongbei Kindergarten and the Ningbo Minguo Daily News Editorial Department are both attached to it. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 PM yesterday (the 5th), the kitchen of the kindergarten suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. The fire was very fierce and unapproachable. It took about an hour to put it out. The main hall and the side rooms on both sides of the temple were completely burned down. The staff bedrooms and accumulated reports of the Minguo Daily News were also destroyed. The total loss is estimated to be about 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Relief for Flood Victims in the Lower River Region Completed (Nantong Correspondence) In the autumn of last year, Nantong established a reception center for flood victims from the lower river region north of the Yangtze River, accommodating more than 2,000 male and female flood victims, according to provincial orders. Now, the province's relief efforts have been cut off, and local subsidies are difficult to raise. After a resolution by the Relief Affairs Conference, the flood victims will be completely assisted in returning to their hometowns, and a report will be submitted to the province on the 6th to abolish the reception center.</p>
<p>Department of Education Rules on Disputes Over School Property (Nantong Correspondence) The dispute between the Nantong County Education Bureau and the Xinhua Soap Factory over school property has not been resolved for four years. The Department of Education has now ruled that the original disposition regarding the county government sending personnel to jointly receive the property with the Education Bureau should be revoked, and the Nantong County Education Bureau should file an administrative appeal according to law.</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Lampson Took a Plane to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>About to Return to His Country from Beiping</p>
<p>After the signing of the Sino-Japanese truce agreement, British Ambassador Sir Miles Lampson and British Fleet Commander Admiral Kelly, with the Shanghai Incident temporarily coming to an end, both left Shanghai yesterday. Ambassador Lampson and Secretary Scott took a plane to Nanjing at 8:30 AM yesterday, and then transferred to a car to Beiping. Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi sent the Director of the Intelligence Department, Zhang Sixu, as a representative to the Hongqiao Airport to see him off. Many other Chinese and British dignitaries also saw him off. Ambassador Lampson will apply for leave to return to his country after returning to Beiping this time. Therefore, the Chinese and Japanese government officials both presented gifts to commemorate his mediation in the Shanghai Incident. Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei specially presented a golden incense burner and several flower carpets. The Japanese government also presented valuable gifts. British Fleet Commander Admiral Kelly took the HMS Suffolk to Wusong this morning, transferred to his flagship HMS Kent, and then led the HMS Suffolk and the destroyer HMS Westminster to Weihaiwei. In addition, US Ambassador Johnson also took a ship to Ningbo the day before yesterday and then transferred to a car to Beiping.</p>
<h3>Japanese Praise its Great Diplomatic Success</h3>
<p>Osaka Asahi Shimbun, Geneva dispatch: Since the British Ambassador to China advised his government to advocate the principle of localism in the Sino-Japanese armistice negotiations, the Continuing Committee on the 26th did not have any objections and recognized that negotiations should be conducted directly between the parties concerned on the ground, which did not violate the resolution of the General Assembly. This is considered very satisfactory for Japan. Currently, the League of Nations Secretariat is gradually showing a harmonious attitude towards the Japanese government in order to solve the aftermath of the situation. As for the results of the Continuing Committee, only small countries harbor dissatisfaction. This is the result of the joint suppression of small countries by major countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. Therefore, even if they still have the idea of retaliation if they have any opportunities in the future, they can't do anything about it. Moreover, the negotiations have actually been completed, and they can no longer intervene. This can be said to be a great diplomatic success for our country, and the small countries that echo and follow can only succumb, even if they show dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun: After the Armistice Agreement Drafting Committee amended Article 4 on the 27th, a new note was added: "If one of the Sino-Japanese parties neglects to implement the Armistice Agreement, the Mixed Committee may draw the attention of the parties concerned to this fact." Regarding this point, China's previous stubborn insistence on wanting our government to clearly indicate the time for the withdrawal of troops has also been invisibly eliminated. However, Chinese newspapers on the 28th unanimously criticized this point, saying, "Why did the National Government approve such a proposal? If so, the land of Jiangnan will be occupied by the Japanese army semi-permanently." All Chinese newspapers unanimously expressed such a view. On the other hand, English newspapers praised the approval of the Lampson plan as a great victory for Japanese diplomacy.</p>
<h3>The World's Attention is Once Again Focused on Manchuria</h3>
<p>Japan's Stance on the Manchurian Problem</p>
<p>Still Advocates Withdrawal from the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily News reported that after the signing of the Sino-Japanese truce agreement, the Shanghai issue can be said to have come to an end. However, the attention of the world is once again focused on Manchuria. A small number of countries advocate that Manchuria should be under international joint management, but our country believes that the Manchurian problem should be resolved by Manchuria itself and governed by the Manchurian government. If necessary, we will not hesitate to provide assistance. Our government will implement this established policy. In the event that the League of Nations conference takes unfair measures against Japan in the future, our country will resolutely adopt a tough stance and withdraw from the League.</p>
<h3>重光 Not Yet Out of Danger</h3>
<p>His Temperature Reached 39 Degrees Celsius Last Night</p>
<p>There Is Still No Definite Certainty About His Life</p>
<p>Since Ambassador Shigemitsu underwent major surgery to amputate his right leg, due to anemia, his temperature soared to 40 degrees Celsius the day before yesterday, and his pulse reached 130, putting him in extreme danger for a time. After 6 PM the night before last, as a result of blood transfusions, his temperature gradually decreased, and his life began to show a glimmer of hope. His condition also improved slightly yesterday morning, with an increased appetite, and an average temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius. However, at 2 PM yesterday afternoon, his temperature suddenly rose again to 38.9 degrees Celsius. At 4 PM, Dr. Goto performed another surgery, incising the sole of his left foot and removing four fragments, and the process went well. However, by 9 PM in the evening, his temperature had risen again to 39 degrees Celsius. Although Dr. Goto expressed an optimistic attitude to the Japanese reporters, according to the evaluation of general physicians, Ambassador Shigemitsu's life is still far from certain. If there are no significant changes today, he may be able to escape danger. According to the condition report released by Fumin Hospital yesterday, at 2 AM yesterday morning, the temperature was 38 degrees, the pulse was 96, and the respiration was 20. At 5 AM, it was 38.5 degrees, the pulse was 100, and the respiration was 28. At 8 AM, it was 38.6 degrees, the pulse was 96, and the respiration was 26. At 11 AM, it was 38.4 degrees, the pulse was 94, and the respiration was 22. At 2 PM, it was 38.9 degrees, the pulse was 96, and the respiration was 24. At 9 PM, the temperature was 39 degrees. As for Consul General Murai, since yesterday morning, his temperature has decreased to 37.4 degrees, and he is expected to gradually recover.</p>
<h3>The End Is Near for the Traitors of Zhabei</h3>
<p>The Zhabei traitors Hu Lifu, Wang Du, etc., seeing that the ceasefire agreement has been signed and established, and that all areas of Zhabei will soon be taken over by the municipal government and police authority will be restored, are extremely panicked. They have been pleading with the Japanese military authorities for protection. Unexpectedly, the Japanese military also, due to the provisions of the ceasefire agreement stipulating that the municipal administrative power, including police power, within the areas temporarily stationed by the Japanese military, will still be exercised by the Chinese authorities, and that the Japanese military should not in any way interfere with the work of the municipal government, refused to provide protection. Thus, the traitors who relied on the power of the Japanese military have now fallen into a dead end. Yesterday, the Zhabei Self-Government Advancement Association on Linping Road was also dismantled and disbanded.</p>
<h3>Letters from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, etc., Regarding the Preparation of National Crisis Savings Funds</h3>
<p>Because Long-Term Savings Funds Are Different from Temporary Fundraising</p>
<p>Increasing Members' Burdens Requires Submission to the General Assembly According to Law</p>
<p>The National Crisis Savings Fund initiated by the Citizens' Joint Association and other organizations, after sending personnel to contact various circles, has seen a continuous stream of enthusiastic responses. Although the time has not been long, the results have already been quite impressive. The association had previously sent representatives to request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send personnel to participate in the preparations. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce replied to the association, stating, "In reply, we have received your letter requesting approval of the preparation committee for the National Crisis Savings Fund, etc. This case was first brought up for discussion at the 91st regular meeting of our Chamber on the 2nd of this month. It was unanimously agreed that saving funds to save the country is a preparation for long-term resistance against Japan, and in principle, it is absolutely agreed. Furthermore, our Chamber has previously had resolutions regarding the preparation fund for the war against Japan and the contribution of various industries. However, long-term savings funds are different from temporary fundraising in terms of approach. According to the Commercial Association Law and the Trade Association Law, increasing members' burdens must be approved by the members' general meeting, and the undertaking must concentrate the power of various industries in order to achieve satisfactory and grand results. It is proposed that the executive committee submit this case to the members' general meeting for discussion, etc." After deliberation, it was submitted to the 24th meeting of the executive committee of our Chamber on May 6, and with the endorsement of Executive Committee Member Wu Zhihao, it was passed in accordance with the opinion of the standing committee. We are now replying to your letter, please take note accordingly.</p>

<h3>The 19th Route Army Will Hold a Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers on a Regular Basis</h3>
<p>Location: Suzhou</p>
<p>Date: May 20th</p>
<p>Since the night of January 28th, when the brutal Japanese began their invasion and started the war in Zhabei, Shanghai, the 19th Route Army, fulfilling its duty as soldiers to defend the country and its territory, bravely resisted, maneuvering with the enemy, charging and fighting hand-to-hand, venturing in and out of a hail of bullets. It has now been more than three months. There have undoubtedly been many loyal and brave soldiers who have died under the artillery fire of the brutal Japanese. Recently, news was received from the Shanghai office of the 19th Route Army, stating that the army has established a preparatory office for the memorial service for fallen soldiers of the 19th Route Army in Suzhou, preparing everything. The memorial service will be held on a regular basis on the 20th of this month at the Suzhou Public Sports Field. If various circles have elegiac couplets, please send them directly to the preparatory office in Suzhou, or to the Shanghai office of the 19th Route Army at the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office on Xinzha Road for collection and forwarding.</p>
<h3>The 19th Route Army Organizes an Air Force</h3>
<p>With Zhang Huichang as Air Force Commander, and Ding Jixu as Deputy</p>
<p>Divided into Five Squadrons: Reconnaissance, Bombing, Pursuit, Combat, and Cover</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, and the 19th Route Army's active resistance against Japan, Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai and Army Commander Cai Tingkai have sent telegrams to overseas Chinese around the world, soliciting donations of airplanes to facilitate the resistance against Japan. Aviation Commander Zhang Huichang of Guangdong has also sent personnel to various places to personally solicit donations, with excellent results. A total of more than 120 aircraft have been raised and are being shipped back to the country in batches. However, the overseas Chinese have repeatedly and solemnly declared that these aircraft should be used exclusively for foreign defense or bandit suppression and should not participate in domestic operations. According to reliable information from the Shanghai office of the 19th Route Army, Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai and Army Commander Cai Tingkai believe that in this battle against Japan, the 19th Route Army suffered heavy losses due to the lack of an air force. It has now been decided to establish an air squadron of the 19th Route Army with the aircraft donated by overseas Chinese, with Zhang Huichang as the air force commander and Ding Jixu as the deputy commander. The organizational structure is divided into five squadrons: reconnaissance, bombing, pursuit, combat, and cover, with a number of aircraft in each squadron, evenly distributed among the more than 120 aircraft. If overseas Chinese continue to donate in the future, they will all be added to the combat and bombing squadrons to strengthen their strength. This time, when Zhang Huichang came to Shanghai from Guangdong, Jiang and Cai entrusted Zhang to handle this plan with full authority. Once approved by the central government, organization can begin. According to personnel from the Shanghai office of the 19th Route Army, after the air squadron is approved and successfully organized by the central government, it will not participate in any internal warfare other than resisting foreign aggression and suppressing bandits, in order to live up to the expectations of the overseas Chinese.</p>

Now, according to the instructions of the municipal government, "All barges in this city are approved for exemption from one month's tax for February only. However, those who have already paid taxes and are operating as usual should be allowed to retain the refund to show fairness." The Bureau of Finance has replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and instructed the trade associations to separately prepare a list of barge numbers for verification by the barge tax offices.

<h3>The Relief Association Continued to Send Victims Back to Wuhu Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The Food Commission Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Food Commission held its 33rd regular meeting at 2 PM on May 7 at the Bureau of Social Affairs. Twelve people attended, including Zhang Binghui, Sun Yongyi, Zhu Zixiang, Yu Zixiang, and Yan Xiaoquan. Zhang Binghui chaired the meeting, and Zhou Minggang recorded the minutes. First, the chairman reported: (1) Due to the situation, the meeting was suspended twice, and thereafter, the regular meeting will still be held once a month as usual. (2) Recently, there have been too many rice and grain exports. For the sake of prudent food supply, and in accordance with the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office's request for joint restrictions, the rice and grain export registration method has been revised. If rice merchants come to Shanghai to handle rice, and the local governments do not directly send official documents to the Bureau of Social Affairs, they must provide proof from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce or the Rice and Grain Trade Association or a certified public accountant. (3) Recently, the rice and grain trade association, which sells rice and grain, has requested the issuance of passports for rice and grain purchased from the interior. However, the Bureau of Social Affairs believes that the municipal government also issues rice transportation passports, which is unavoidable. The bureau is currently requesting instructions for a unified method and will reply after receiving instructions. (4) The transportation expenses for expert committee members were temporarily suspended due to the city treasury's shortfall. Now that the situation has recovered, it is planned to submit a request to the municipal government to approve the continuation of the previous allocation. As for the discussion items, it was resolved: (1) The survey and statistics of rice and grain in this city will continue to be carried out. In addition to requesting the Bureau of Social Affairs to send personnel to investigate, the Rice Industry Association will be asked to assist in reporting. (2) Rice ships transporting rice to Shanghai from the interior are often detained by the military, which greatly affects the food supply. It was decided to submit a request to the municipal government to forward it to the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Military Commission to instruct all armies in the front to release all ships holding the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs' rice transportation flag. (3) Regarding the export of rice and grain, in addition to proof from the local government and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce or the rice industry group and certified public accountants, the Bureau of Social Affairs is requested to formulate a certificate format for distribution to various rice industry groups. After the rice industry groups are responsible for verification, it can be released.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs to change the rice and grain export registration method. Yesterday, the person in charge of the bureau stated, "Regarding the export of rice and grain in this city, rice merchants have always held rice transportation passports from local governments, which are stamped by the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, and then apply for registration with the bureau. The bureau previously received a letter from the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office stating that since the Japanese army forcibly occupied Zhabei, Liuhe, and other places, rice and grain exports from this city have suddenly increased. In one month, the rice and grain transported to Tong, Chong, and Hai have totaled more than 10,000 dan. In order to prevent aiding the enemy and exporting it to other places, it is proposed to jointly restrict it. The bureau checked the registered quantity of rice and grain exports, and the quantity of rice and grain exports in March and April was double the export quantity of the previous year. In order to prevent abuses, the registration method was changed. That is, for all rice and grain exports, in addition to having passports from various governments, there must also be a direct telegram from the government to this bureau for verification. If this procedure is not available, there must be a certificate issued by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce or the Rice and Grain Trade Association or a certified public accountant in Shanghai to prove it. This regulation is designed to be prudent about the food supply, so the inclusion of the certified public accountant item was originally intended to facilitate rice merchants to obtain proof from more places. Certified public accountants can handle or certify all documents or events in commercial affairs, and it is not inappropriate in principle. If it is said that certified public accountants charge public fees, this is a matter of personal business and is not this bureau opening up a way for certified public accountants to make a fortune. This bureau has not stipulated that all certificates must be issued by certified public accountants and that fees must be paid. If rice merchants want to be free, they can ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce or the Rice and Grain Trade Association for certification. This bureau has never delayed registration. For example, the North City Office of the Bean and Rice Industry Association and Mr. Gu Xinyi, a member of the standing committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, submitted certificates to the bureau, which were stamped immediately. As for the so-called different proofs and different treatments in the news, it is not known what it is based on. The registration method of this bureau is entirely based on principles and is not inconvenient for merchants and people. For the sake of prudent food supply, it should be handled in accordance with the newly revised method and never be easily changed."</p>
<h3>The Anti-Opium Association Again Cables Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>Public Sales in North China Provinces Have Become Concrete Realities</p>
<p>Questions Whether Telegram to Tianjin Association Is Based on Denial</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Association reported yesterday that Hebei Pacification Director Zhang Xueliang had cabled to deny the implementation of public opium sales in the four provinces of North China. The Anti-Opium Association believes that it is necessary to thoroughly understand the truth in this matter and has again cabled Zhang Xueliang to inquire about the beginning and end of the matter. The original text is recorded as follows: "Urgent delivery to Mr. Zhang Hanqing, Hebei Pacification Director. The previous telegram should have arrived and been noted. Now, according to the report from the Hebei Anti-Opium Association, regarding the implementation of public opium sales in the four provinces of North China, you telegraphed the association, strongly denying it. The association was first happy to hear this, but then became confused. We were happy because you advocated opium prohibition and have not changed your original intention. We were confused because the obvious facts are like this and seem difficult to erase. According to recent newspaper reports, public opium sales have indeed been implemented in the four provinces under your jurisdiction. The opium delivered to Tianjin has reached more than 3,000 tons, and the rest is still being transported. The official opium sales agency in Hebei Province is the Northern Company, a powerful organization initially established in the Third Special District. Later, because the transportation of opium passed through the Italian Concession and 60,000 taels were seized, it was moved to the Second Special District. When opium arrives in Tianjin, it is unloaded at the new station, and destruction certificates are issued. People who sell and transport opium purchase certificates and can pass without hindrance. Police and soldiers must protect them. Each destruction certificate costs two yuan, and one certificate is affixed to each package of opium weighing twenty taels, which can be used in this area. If it is transported from this area to another area, the fee is doubled. If the police and soldiers inspect the destruction certificate in transit and the amount affixed is insufficient, a double penalty will be imposed. Thus, Sui opium is sold smoothly in the Pingjin area. The fundraising committee, in order to plan for the long term, is afraid that after official sales, the number of addicts will increase and the source will be limited. For a long time, the supply will not meet the demand. Therefore, it is proposed to order the county magistrates to persuade farmers to plant opium, which will not only avoid a lack of supply but also allow the collection of opium taxes. All of the above measures are symbols of public sales. Openly collecting taxes, persuading farmers to plant opium, issuing destruction certificates with the nature of stamps, eating, selling, transporting, and planting are all free from the law. Police and soldiers also have the obligation to protect them. The concrete state of public opium sales has already adopted everything, without exception. What has not been used is only to avoid the name of public sales. It is completely contrary to your telegram, which is very confusing. In the past, the area where opium prohibition was best handled in our country, the Northeast, achieved the most prominent results. This association was proud of it, believing that meat eaters are not necessarily all incapable of planning. Unexpectedly, the Mukden Incident occurred, and you retreated to Pingjin. The blows you suffered were too deep, and your views also wavered as a result, reversing your previous determination to implement opium prohibition and coveting the evil system of public opium sales. This cannot but make those who love you heartbroken and those who hate you more critical. I hope that you will act decisively, exert your wisdom, and immediately withdraw your order, abolish the public sales system, and severely punish those who advocate traitors to prevent disaster and protect your reputation. Your sincere heart hopes for your understanding. Respectfully, the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association, Yang."</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Shanghai Bar Association</h3>
<p>Correcting Macnaghten's Speech</p>
<p>On April 13 of this year, the Western taxpayers of the Shanghai Public Concession held an annual meeting. Macnaghten, the chairman of the Municipal Council, vigorously attacked the First Special District Court when reporting on the administrative situation of the concession in the past year. The points of his attack can be roughly divided into two points. First, after September 18, the court turned a blind eye to the boycott of Japanese goods, which led to the Sino-Japanese Zhabei War. Therefore, the court was deemed to have failed in its duty. Second, foreign merchants were very dissatisfied with the court's civil cases, and the annual speech of the chairman of the Harmony Merchants' Association was used as proof. It was also hoped that after the current agreement expires, an international court could be organized to replace the existing court, and that uniform civil and criminal laws could be implemented for residents within the concession, regardless of nationality. Macnaghten's report on the situation of the court that day was roughly like this. This association feels that it is necessary to correct such fallacies that are not legal or factual and specially refutes them as follows. According to this, Japan used its naval, land, and air forces to invade Shanghai, which was a step planned for its entire policy of aggression against China. Anyone who is familiar with the situation in the Far East can see this. Therefore, it is not true that the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods was the fuse for the Japanese aggression. Otherwise, Mayor Wu would have unconditionally succumbed to the beautiful note of his naval commander on January 28, and one of the conditions of surrender was to disband the anti-Japanese national salvation association. If the Japanese regarded the anti-Japanese movement as the reason for their use of force, they would have been complacent and silently rested. However, the blood was not yet dry, and the smoke of war suddenly rose. A good market was turned into ashes. What was the intention? There is no need for our people to investigate. However, Macnaghten actually placed the responsibility for this war on the First Special District Court, not only ignoring the general trend in the Far East but also obliterating the local situation. Furthermore, according to our country's laws, the court does not hear criminal cases unless they are reported, and the Special District Court is restricted by the agreement, that is, the prosecutor's right to sue is almost completely deprived. The person who holds the criminal prosecution power in the Public Concession is the Municipal Council Police Department. According to the court's statement the day before yesterday, the Municipal Council only prosecuted three cases related to the anti-Japanese movement, and all of them were legally judged by the court. Some were acquitted due to insufficient evidence, and some were fined due to minor circumstances. Benevolence and knowledge are seen, and the judges have the power to make their own judgments. How can they be judged to have failed in their duty because the legal judgment failed to meet the hopes of a small number of citizens in the area? This kind of argument can be tolerated if it comes from the mouth of an ignorant person. But now it is seen in the speech of the person sitting in the position of the chairman of the Municipal Council at the annual meeting of Western taxpayers, talking eloquently and making wild remarks. This is something that members of this association cannot but regret. It is heard that one of the cases is in the process of appeal, and the police department is still in the position of the plaintiff. However, the responsible person of the police department's superior agency publicly criticized how unfair the judgment was and how partial the judge was. It is obvious that they are trying to use political power to suppress the judiciary. It is impossible not to be surprised and disappointed. Furthermore, in Macnaghten's speech, he spared no effort to attack how the Anti-Japanese Association was engaged in private gain and corruption. The organization of the Anti-Japanese Association is a patriotic movement of the people. Whether it should exist or not does not involve the scope of the law and does not need to be elaborated. If its behavior is truly out of line, it should also be reported by the police department in accordance with the law, and then the court can hear and judge it. Now, only two cases have been reported by the police department, and neither of them involves the Anti-Japanese Association itself. Now, why is the court blamed for not enforcing the law to rope it in? Why is it strict in blaming others and lenient in blaming oneself? Therefore, based on the above, it is more appropriate to say that the police department failed in its duty than to say that the court failed in its duty. As for foreign merchants' dissatisfaction with civil cases, the points of dissatisfaction are not stated. Aimless, there is no value in answering. Looking closely at Macnaghten's speech, the most important focus is to establish an international court in the Public Concession. This is his attack on the Special District Court and his criticism of China's judiciary. He uses the theory of innocence as a step to support his own arguments. If this is the case, then why not say it directly? Why go around in circles and use our country's dignified legal system as a sacrifice for his speech? This is not what the people of a country ruled by law should do. In short, what our colleagues cannot say to Macnaghten and all the Western directors and citizens of the Municipal Council is that if you want the safety and prosperity of the Shanghai Public Concession, the rule of law is the first priority. If you want to promote the rule of law, then eliminating power is the first priority. This responsibility should be borne entirely by the Municipal Council. But in this incident, the Japanese navy, army, and air force used the concession as a base for operations, which already violated the treaty, and the ronin and hooligans acted as accomplices, committing all kinds of evil. It is not known how many Chinese people were slaughtered, raped, and killed, and it is not known how many people were kidnapped and disappeared. The property of Chinese and foreigners suffered losses due to this Japanese invasion, and the value is more than tens of millions of yuan. The law is equal to invalidity, and the treaties have all become waste paper. It has not been heard that the Municipal Council has protested in one incident or prosecuted in one case. The rule of law that Chinese and foreigners have longed for has fallen to an all-time low and entered a point of no return. Our colleagues are deeply saddened by this. Why did Macnaghten and the Western directors not mention a word about it at the current annual meeting of Western taxpayers? This is truly what is called seeing the small and abandoning the big, knowing the near and forgetting the far. If this kind of erroneous view is not changed one day, then the future of the concession's security will be worrying one day, and the goal of the rule of law will not be achieved one day. Macnaghten has gone, and may the Western directors of the current session encourage themselves well.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Employees of the Commercial Press Compilation and Translation Institute</h3>
<p>Discussing Ways to Deal with Employer Dismissals</p>
<p>The entire staff of the Compilation and Translation Institute of the Commercial Press was quite excited after recently learning that the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs had approved the employer's dismissal. They all believed that the employer had not gone bankrupt, and was in the process of recovery. To apply such a poisonous means to employees who had suffered the same disaster and had no home to return to was contrary to law, reason, and human sentiment. In the Compilation and Translation Institute, many old friends, such as biologist Du Yaquan and scholar Jiang Boxun, have been colleagues of the institute for twenty or thirty years. Their retirement pensions and old-age pensions are worth thousands of yuan. They had repeatedly wanted to retire in the past, using this to support their remaining years, but were retained by the company. This time, the company is using losses as an excuse to deprive them of this old-age pension, which is even more embarrassing. The employees currently in Shanghai are all requesting that a general meeting be convened to discuss countermeasures. It is heard that the committee has decided to convene a tea party at the Central Western Restaurant this afternoon (the 8th) at 2 PM.</p>
<h3>The Long Unresolved Labor Dispute at the *Shishi Xinbao* Newspaper</h3>
<p>The labor dispute at the Shanghai *Shishi Xinbao* newspaper, which began over a month ago, has remained unresolved despite mediation efforts by third parties, due to repeated delays by the management. It is reported that the workers who were forced to leave the newspaper after being unreasonably dismissed by the management are facing severe financial difficulties. They have printed fundraising booklets and various promotional materials, and are appealing to the public for donations, gaining widespread sympathy. The labor union believes that the newspaper issue is crucial to the survival of the entire union, and therefore insists on achieving the goal of resuming work.</p>
<h3>Reported Strike at the Qiuxin Shipyard Yesterday</h3>
<p>Workers at the Qiuxin Shipyard, dissatisfied with the management's violation of labor-management agreements and various forms of oppression, have launched a strike. It is understood that the management has expressed willingness to concede on certain conditions, such as retroactively paying wages deducted for the Huanghuagang Martyrs' Memorial Day and night shifts. They also agreed to universally increase wages by five cents for all workers. However, the issue of full payment of wages during the strike period remains in contention. The factory only agreed to pay for one day of strike wages and set a deadline of 4:00 PM yesterday for the union to respond. The union argued that the strike was triggered by the management's oppression, therefore the fault lies with the management, and wages should be paid in full. A meeting was convened with all members at 2:00 PM yesterday for discussion. It is understood that in order to maintain labor-management relations, the union has also expressed a willingness to make some concessions.</p>
<h3>Detective Killed While Arresting Thieves, Eight Notorious Robbers Captured</h3>
<h3>Detective Jin's Funeral Set for Tomorrow</h3>
<h3>Police Station Will Provide Compensation to the Bereaved Family</h3>
<h3>Qian Achun Dies from Severe Injuries</h3>
<h3>Trial of Eight Robbers Postponed</h3>
<p>Jin Baoyi, a probationary detective from Siyang who had recently been promoted to Detective Number 61 at the French Concession Police, was patrolling with fellow officers at 8:20 PM when they encountered three suspected criminals at the intersection of Avenue de la Victoire and Rue de Bayle. The suspects opened fire, injuring Jin in the head, killing him instantly, and wounding passersby with stray bullets. Fellow officers and patrolmen pursued and captured one of the suspects, seizing a Mauser pistol with nineteen rounds of ammunition. The suspect was taken to the police station, and Jin's body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor for an autopsy. The injured passersby were sent to the hospital for treatment. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the captured suspect identified himself as Wang Ziqing, age 28, from Anhui Province. He also revealed the hiding places of his accomplices. Special agents, including Detective Inspector Jin Jiulin, Chief Detective Li Yaolong, Mao Jingen, Deputy Detective Zhang Ziying, and Qian Yumin, led a full complement of armed officers, along with detectives from the Second Branch of the Second District of the Chinese Public Safety Bureau, to No. 2 Lanfang Lane, Zhaojiabang Road at midnight. There, they arrested Liu Biao, Wang Shoujing, and Zheng Chang, all from Hunan Province. Waiting until 2:00 AM, they apprehended Fu Shunqing and Fu Panmin, both from Shandong Province, who arrived at the location. They were all taken to the police station. Later, in collaboration with Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession Police, they proceeded to Room 38 of the Lin'an Hotel at No. 257 Jiu'an Lane, Guangdong Road, and captured Wang Yousheng and Yu Juxing, both from Zhejiang Province. A handgun and seven rounds of ammunition were found on the roof of the hotel and confiscated. The suspects were taken to the police station for investigation. Yesterday morning, Wu Xiaoke, the prosecutor from the Second Special District Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Jiang Xuan and clerk Zhao Yifen, arrived at the police station after being informed by the Criminal Division of the General Police Station. They examined the body and convened a formal hearing. Detective Bao presented the details of the case. Jin Wangshi, the deceased detective's wife, filed a request for redress. The defendants were escorted to the case by police detectives. After questioning by the prosecutor, it was determined that Jin Douyi (Jin Baoyi) had indeed died from gunshot wounds sustained before his death. The body was released to his wife, Jin Wangshi, for funeral arrangements. The defendants were handed over to the police for further investigation. After the autopsy, at 11:00 AM, the police escorted the eight defendants to the Second Special District Court. Judge Li Changnian, accompanied by clerk Wu Shan, presided over the hearing in the First Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case, stating that at approximately 8:00 PM the previous night, detectives from</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>the Police Station were inspecting pedestrians for criminals on Avenue de la Victoire when they were fired upon by the defendants, resulting in the death of Detective Jin Baoyi from a headshot and injuries to bystanders from stray bullets. Only one defendant and seven of his accomplices were apprehended. The police are charging them with obstructing official duties, murder, and robbery under Articles 142(3), 282, and 348 of the Criminal Code. The police still need to thoroughly investigate whether the defendants have committed other crimes. Due to time constraints, the police requested a postponement of the trial for two weeks. The seized Mauser pistol and ammunition were presented as evidence. Judge Li briefly questioned the defendants and announced that the trial would be postponed to May 21st. The defendants were temporarily detained at the police station. Qian Achun, also known as A Lin, the bystander who was injured by a stray bullet, age 35, from Changzhou, and working as a dockworker, was sent to Guangci Hospital. Due to severe abdominal injuries, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 10:00 AM yesterday. The hospital notified the police, who took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor for an autopsy. As his address was unknown, his family could not be located. The court will be notified tomorrow to conduct an inspection. Wu Yuexiang, a tailor, age 33, from Taicang, sustained minor injuries and is being treated at Renji Hospital. He is expected to recover soon. The detective's body will be placed in a coffin today and the funeral will be held tomorrow. At 1:00 PM, the procession will depart from the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor, proceed west on Xixinqiao Street, north on Avenue Edward VII, west on Avenue Petain, turn onto Avenue de la Victoire, and south on Rue de Bayle, directly to the Yiji Shanhui in the Chinese area for temporary storage. A date will be chosen later to transport the remains back to his hometown for burial. His colleagues and police staff commend Jin's bravery and dedication to public service and will raise funds to support his family. All will attend the funeral.</p>
<h3>Sister Sues Brother with Tears, Brother Remains Unmoved</h3>
<h3>Father Left an Estate of Nearly a Million</h3>
<h3>Court Awards Five Thousand Yuan, Brother Refuses to Pay</h3>
<h3>Siblings Continue to Litigate</h3>
<h3>Judge Urges Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Hu Disheng, manager of the Xinyun Money Exchange, and his brother, Hu Runsheng, both shareholders of the Yida Money Exchange and both from Yuyao, were sued last year by their sister, Hu Shanshan, for neglect of support. According to the complaint, Shanshan was only seven months old when her father, Youxiang, passed away, leaving an estate of nearly a million. The estate was managed by her eldest brother, Disheng, and second brother, Lansheng. Disheng was born to the first wife, Zhou, while Lansheng and Shanshan were born to Cheng. The plaintiff claimed that she had a hard life and is now over thirty years old. After her two elder brothers divided the property and lived separately, she lived with her biological mother at Lansheng's residence. However, the plaintiff has vowed to remain single and works at the Nanyang Women's Middle School to support herself. Now, more than thirty years after her father's death, she does not have the right to demand a share of the estate. However, since the plaintiff is determined not to marry and has no ability to support herself, based on the precedents of the Supreme Court cases 5Shang318, 3Shang669, and 7Shang761, she is entitled to request that the defendants assume the obligation of support or provide a living allowance. Therefore, she requested a judgment ordering the two defendants to pay 100,000 yuan in alimony. After investigation by the First Special District Court, the court concluded that the amount requested by the plaintiff was excessive. After considering the defendants' ability, the court ordered them to pay the plaintiff 5,000 yuan in cash. Hu Lansheng expressed his satisfaction with this judgment. However, Hu Disheng refused to pay even a single cent. He hired a lawyer to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, claiming that Shanshan had no right to claim support and that she lived with her mother, whose food and clothing were provided by Lansheng, which means she was already being supported. He further argued that the appellant had no ability to pay and requested that the original judgment be dismissed. Hu Shanshan, because her elder brother did not accept the original judgment and filed an appeal, also hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend her case and filed a cross-appeal, insisting that the court order the defendants to comply with the original judgment and pay her 50,000 yuan in cash. Her reasons were as follows: Shanshan is alone and has not received adequate education and lacks specialized skills. She is only thirty years old and has a long life ahead of her. Her mother will eventually pass away, and she has no reliable relatives. If she does not seek support, how will she maintain her livelihood? Lansheng's economic status is far less than that of Disheng. He is also kind enough to accept the judgment out of brotherly love. Only Disheng is cruel and has control of the vast estate of their ancestors but has not provided support or education to his biological mother and sister, leaving Shanshan without skills and alone. He is now unwilling to pay the small amount ordered by the court and has filed an appeal, further demonstrating his unreasonableness. Furthermore, according to Disheng, their deceased father's will was forged by Lansheng. Regarding this point, she is currently collecting evidence and preparing to file a criminal lawsuit. She requested that the appeal be rejected and the original verdict be changed, ordering Disheng to pay 50,000 yuan in cash. Yesterday, Presiding Judge Hu Min of the Second Branch of the High Court, along with judges Han and Ye, held a hearing. They first questioned Hu Disheng about the reasons for his appeal. Hu claimed that he had no ability to pay and requested that the original judgment be dismissed. He further stated that his deceased father's estate was only over 30,000 yuan, and after deducting the expenses for his father's death and funeral, only 28,900 taels remained. Judge Hu then asked Disheng, "If you have no ability to pay now, will you fulfill the original judgment when you have the ability in the future?" Disheng hesitated and said, "This will have to be determined in the future." Judge Hu then advised him, "Siblings litigating against each other is not only frowned upon by traditional morality, but also detrimental to good customs in this modern era. Why do you value money more than your siblings?" He then urged them to seek reconciliation to end the dispute. However, Disheng did not make any concrete expression. The court then questioned Hu Shanshan, who tearfully stated that her elder brother definitely had assets and had deposits in banks such as the Bank of China and the Continental Bank, but it was not easy to investigate. She wept, her appearance likened to a pear blossom in the rain. After the lawyers for both parties had finished their arguments, the court announced that the verdict would be announced at a later date. The judge again earnestly advised both parties and their lawyers to reconcile outside the court. If a peaceful resolution can be reached before the date of the verdict, it can be avoided by legal judgment. The Hu siblings then withdrew with their lawyers.</p>

<h3>Recent Updates on the Riyie Bank Case Handled by City Government Volunteer Lawyers</h3>
<h3>Creditors Should Pay Litigation Fees Quickly</h3>
<p>The case of creditors suing to recover deposits from Shanghai Riyie Bank and Dashijie Amusement Savings Department has been legally pursued by volunteer lawyers Jiang Yiping, Chen Tingrui, Qin Liankui, and Wu Jingxiong, appointed by the city government. Creditors have already received two installments of the distributed payments. However, in the part of the case filed in the former French Court, the court ruled that Ye Shantao and others were exempt from shareholder and director liability, which is inconsistent with the facts. After the appeal was filed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, it was ruled that the litigation fees of more than 7,000 yuan were required to be paid. Because the creditors had financial difficulties and no money to advance, they had to explain the situation and request permission to use legal aid. The court refused to grant the request, and the petition was dismissed. An appeal was filed to the Supreme Court, but it was also rejected. After that, a ruling was received from the High Court urging the payment of the litigation fees. At that time, the Japanese army invaded and the war was raging. Two requests were made to the court for an extension, and the four lawyers published notices in various newspapers, urging creditors to pay the litigation fees within ten days, calculated at one percent of the original amount of the claim, so that they could be collected and submitted to the court to avoid unfavorable judgments due to incomplete appeal procedures. After seeing the notice in the newspapers, creditors actively went to the four lawyers' offices to pay the litigation fees. Every day, a significant amount of litigation fees was remitted from other locations. In addition, many letters were received requesting an extension or a postponement. In order to protect the interests of the creditors, the four lawyers requested the court for one last extension. A ruling has now been received extending the deadline to the 20th of this month. Before the 20th, if there are any creditors of Shanghai Riyie Bank and Dashijie Amusement Savings Department "who have registered at the lawyers' office designated by the city government" or "who have registered at the creditors' group on Lloyd Road," and who have not yet paid the litigation fees, they can bring their deposit slips to the four lawyers' offices and continue to pay the litigation fees at one percent of the total amount of the claim. Those who have already registered in other locations can also clearly state the type, number, date, and amount of the claim and remit the litigation fees to the four lawyers' offices so that they can be collected and submitted to the court to obtain legal remedies.</p>
<h3>Correspondence Between Jin Shuren and the Road Association</h3>
<h3>Xinjiang Actively Building Roads</h3>
<p>A letter from Jin Shuren, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, to the Road Association reads: (Omitted above) Xinjiang is isolated in the frontier and separated from the interior. Traveling from Lanzhou to the capital or other prosperous areas takes months. If disasters or other accidents occur, the timeframe cannot be determined. Although it is faster to go through Siberia, it still takes more than a month and is subject to strict restrictions and difficulties. It can only be done as a last resort. Shuren is now planning to start a long-distance bus service from Dihua to Suiyuan and has sent staff to conduct on-site surveys twice. The results are good. It is estimated that it will take 13 days to reach Suiyuan. Suiyuan is flat and direct, which is far better than the previous two routes. If it can be opened smoothly, it will bring great benefits in terms of transportation and economy. The only concern is the opening cost, which is estimated to be more than one million yuan. He is now actively raising funds to implement the plan as soon as possible. (Omitted below) The Road Association replied: "(Omitted above) We received your letter and are delighted to learn that your province is opening a long-distance bus route from Dihua to Suiyuan, which is estimated to take 13 days to reach. In the future, it will be unimpeded, bringing great benefits in terms of transportation and economy. The success is imminent and the benefits will last for generations. Your construction achievements are truly no less than those of the legendary Yu the Great. After hearing this news, we are very happy. Please send us the project plans, charts, photos, and descriptions of the entire route at any time so that we can publish them in the Roads Monthly, so that people across the country can understand the real achievements of your province in road construction. (Omitted below)"</p>
<h3>Extension of Public Bus Route No. 2</h3>
<p>The public bus company, in view of the fact that many residents in the northern district have now moved to the south of Avenue Foch and Avenue Edward VII, and there is no direct bus route from that area to the northern district, is planning to extend the existing public bus route No. 2 from Hongkou Park to Two-Mile Creek Bridge on Avenue Edward VII westward, via Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, and Avenue Haig, to the vicinity of the Georg Hotel. This plan has now been approved by the Public Works Department and will be implemented soon. After the extension of the route, the company plans to double the number of buses to maintain the frequency of service. The congestion on Route 9 will also be alleviated in the future.</p>
<h3>New Police Station in the Eastern District</h3>
<p>The eastern district of the Public Concession, east of Huishan Road, has been developing rapidly in recent years. However, there is only one police station in that area, the Yangshupu Police Station at the corner of Yangshupu Road and Lan Road. Its jurisdiction is very large, and the police station is one and a half miles away from the eastern boundary. In view of this, the Public Works Department has built a new police station at the corner of Yulin Road and Weituoma Road, and another new police station at the corner of Gelan Road and Pingliang Road. The police station on Yulin Road has been completed and will begin operations on May 15th. The jurisdiction of the new police station extends to the Yangshupu River. The area east of the river will still be managed by the Yangshupu Police Station. The new police stations are built with steel and reinforced concrete, with four floors in one part and five floors in another. They are equipped with steam pipes and sanitary facilities. The lower floor has offices, storage rooms, detention centers, workshops, garages, etc. The upper floors have dormitories for police officers, including three units with four rooms and four units with three rooms for Western officers. There are also 16 single rooms, a dining room, and a recreation room. For Japanese officers, there are 16 units with three rooms and three single rooms. For Indian and Chinese officers, there is accommodation for 28 Indian officers and 78 Chinese officers. In addition, there are dining rooms and accommodations for 36 servants. The garage can accommodate five cars. The construction of the new police station on Gelan Road started later and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Once it is opened, the current Yangshupu Police Station will be closed. The Yangshupu Police Station was established in 1891. It has two floors. Forty years ago, when the population was small, it was sufficient.</p>

<h3>Murder Case of Gao Qiao Cracked</h3>
<p>Adulterous Woman and Murderer Both Detained</p>
<p>Last summer, a case occurred where Zhang Jinmao, a native of Gao Qiao Town in Pudong and a foreman at the Texaco Oil Company, was murdered and his body dumped in the river. The Third District Fourth Precinct, considering it a murder case with the perpetrator at large, reported it to their superiors and issued a strict order for apprehension. Now, almost a year has passed, and the murderer had not been caught, leading many to believe the injustice would remain buried forever. However, recently, Captain Lu of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Detective Squad received a confidential report from Detective Zhang Quanzhou, stating that the suspect, named Fu Peisheng, was currently hiding with his mistress, Zhang Gao (also known as Mao Lang), at No. 12 Hui Ning Road in the South City. Captain Lu, upon receiving the report, first summoned the deceased's father, Zhang Shaoyun, to the station for detailed questioning. According to Zhang Shaoyun, his son Jinmao had been living with his mistress Gao (also known as Mao Lang) in Gao Qiao Town. He worked as a foreman at Texaco, leaving early and returning late, which was his usual routine. A man named Fu Peisheng, whom he had known, was imprisoned in the 16th year due to a case. After his release, having no home to return to, Jinmao invited him to live in his house. Unexpectedly, Gao was of a romantic nature and, taking advantage of Jinmao's absence during the day, gradually began an affair with Fu Peisheng. Furthermore, Jinmao was always enthusiastic about public affairs in Gao Qiao, especially regarding theft cases, where he would do his best to assist the authorities in solving them. Therefore, he was deeply resented by bandits. Two days before his death, while he was drinking tea in the Qujiaqiao teahouse, Fu Peisheng suddenly said, "Although your son Jinmao is currently catching robbers with the Gaoqiao police, there are many robbers, and he will be beaten to death by them in the future." Unexpectedly, on the night of the eleventh, Jinmao was murdered. The next day, he went to Gao's residence to inquire, but she had already fled, and Fu Peisheng was also nowhere to be found. Following these clues, Fu Peisheng was deemed to be highly suspicious. Detective Hu Kui-sheng, Cui You-kuan, Gu You-san, Han Feng-ying, and Xia Xiu-ying were dispatched, along with police officers from the Second District, to arrest Fu Peisheng and Zhang Gao and bring them back to the station for separate interrogations. Fu confessed that during the fourth month of the previous lunar year, he had an affair with Zhang Gao. He initially knew nothing about Zhang Jinmao's murder. The next day, Mao Lang came to Shanghai and found him at his sister's place, where he learned about it. Later, due to rumors that anyone acquainted with Zhang Jinmao would be arrested, he fled with Mao Lang, first to Hankou, then back to Nanjing, and then from Nanjing back to Shanghai, eventually fleeing to Jiaxing. Only at the end of November did they return to Shanghai. When questioned, Zhang Gao confessed that on the night of the incident, she and Jinmao had already gone to sleep when two men came upstairs and asked Jinmao to come outside to talk. At that time, Jinmao instructed her to follow him downstairs. However, after walking a few steps out the door, she saw that there was another man and woman waiting there. She then saw Jinmao walking ahead with the two men who had come upstairs, while she followed behind with the other man and woman. Unexpectedly, as she passed Qujiaqiao, she suddenly heard a sound like a small cannon, and immediately the woman told her, "Zhang Jinmao has been killed by them." She screamed for help but they stuffed her mouth, etc. After hearing the confessions, Captain Lu believed that although Fu Peisheng and the others did not confess to the murder, their act of fleeing with Zhang Gao from Hankou to Nanjing to Shanghai to Zhejiang clearly indicated guilt and evasion. At the same time, it was also discovered that the suspect was also significantly involved in the case of Yuan Erlang and other robbers that the Third District Fourth Precinct had submitted last autumn. He was also wanted by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. Therefore, the suspect was not only suspected of murder but was also a fugitive robber. Therefore, he prepared a document and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening around 10:45, near the eastern end of the Xiafei Road Songshan Road Police Station, a rickshaw carrying a pedestrian in his twenties was traveling west to east.

<h3>Gradual Improvement Expected in Yarn and Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The Flower Yarn Market Suspended for One Day on the 5th</p>
<p>Signs of improvement are gradually emerging in the yarn market, requiring even more activity. There is hope for a turnaround in the situation. The Jiangxi merchants, who have been inactive for a long time, have begun purchasing. Therefore, the current yarn market situation is firmer than yesterday. However, demand from other merchant groups remains sluggish. Japanese yarn floods North China, leaving no room for domestic yarn. As for the Japanese-owned yarn factories in this city, their operations are gradually returning to normal, with vigorous activity in the background. This has dealt a significant blow to domestic yarn. Some manufacturers are losing confidence and have no intention of holding firm on current yarn prices, choosing to follow the trend. This may lead to a slight reduction in inventory. However, given the recent sharp decline in prices, a temporary rebound is likely. However, the unstable political situation and stagnant financial conditions are closely related to the yarn market.</p>
<p>Spot Standard Up Five to Six Cents. The spot standard market opened with a tight situation due to the rising prices. In addition, external prices also increased. There was a shortage of sellers in the market, but transactions remained low. Prices for all months rose by five to six cents. The afternoon market was flat, with this month's price rising by one cent, and far-month prices were flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 4,950 bales. Changfeng sold 400 bales, Xiesheng 200 bales, Yiyu 350 bales, Ruidar 700 bales, Yuandar 150 bales, Gengfeng 100 bales, and Zhenda 100 bales. Mingde bought 150 bales, Changji 350 bales, Changfeng 900 bales, Jifeng 100 bales, Hengchang 150 bales, and Renfeng 100 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Spot Standard Closing Prices Compared to Previous Day's Account Balance: September 1520, up 5, 16.500; July futures, 514, up 6, 11.400; October 1520, 5, 18.050; August futures, 1513, 4, 15.550; Total: 61.500</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Relatively Active: The sales of spot yarn have improved. It is found that all merchant groups purchased a total of 1,221 bales throughout the day, with 111 bales being traded among peers. Prices rose by 2.5 to 5 cents, but thread prices remained unchanged. Ningbo merchants purchased 20 bales, Jiangxi merchants 720 bales, inland merchants 90 bales, Guangdong merchants 105 bales, Northern merchants 50 bales, Wuhu merchants 15 bales, Shantou merchants 55 bales, and Fujian merchants 55 bales. Shenxin Factory offered 1200 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Even More Bullish</h3>
<p>The cotton market situation is particularly tight. The continued rise in American cotton prices for several days has improved the yarn market, leading to a stronger cotton market. Due to the low inventory of domestic cotton, there is a shortage of new sellers in the market, pushing prices higher. However, actual demand remains sluggish, and factories are extremely hesitant. Although the price of foreign cotton futures has risen, the weakening exchange rate makes calculations based on silver prices still cheaper than domestic cotton. Therefore, there is no indication of a significant price increase in the market.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Up Three to Four Cents. The Zheng Standard market opened with rising prices due to increases in both American and Indian cotton. Market sentiment was tight, and there was a shortage of sellers. Prices for all months rose by 2.3 cents. The afternoon situation remained firm, with prices for all months rising by 5 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 16,100 dan. Shenchang sold 300 dan, Ruidar 1,200 dan, Tongxing 400 dan, Changfeng 1,100 dan, Dachang 300 dan, Yuandar 1,600 dan, Changhe 1,000 dan, and Zhenda 200 dan.

The closing prices of Zheng Standard are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Prices Compared to Previous Day's Account Balance: October futures, 3265, up 35, 49.000; July futures, 3265, up 30, 32.500; Total: 125.500; August futures, 3275, 40, 44.000</p>

<p>Shaanxi cotton: 31.75; Dafeng purchased 200 pieces; Spot delivery to factories, Tianjin cotton: 33.50; Shenxin purchased 400 pieces; Also, Also</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Prices Rise Across the Board</h3>

<h3>New Green Tea Opens in the Silk, Tea, and Local Produce Market</h3>
<p>Local tea factories in this city have been transporting new raw tea from Zhuji, Si'an, Huzhou, and Suian for days, numbering no less than 200 packages. Tea factories such as Tiancheng, Yitongxing, Wanchengxiang, and Wusenji have all started working overtime to produce the first batch of Zhenmei tea from Shaoxing. The new prices were offered by Jardine Matheson and Xiehe companies in the past two days, ranging from 120 to 125 taels. It is reported that large quantities of leaves from Suian and Huzhou, which are of better quality, will be listed on the market one after another next Monday.</p>
<h3>New Samples of Qimen Black Tea Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Qimen black tea, yesterday, two new samples were sent from Jiujiang. After the assessment by Jardine Matheson tea experts, it was recognized that the aroma, taste, and strands were even better than last year. However, due to excessive frost last winter, the harvests in all regions were reported to be poor. According to a general survey and estimate by tea merchants, the total output of Qimen, Fuliang, and Jiande this year will be no more than 48,000 boxes, a decrease of about 20% compared to previous years.</p>
<h3>Suian Raw Tea Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Suian green tea market on the 27th of last month, the asking price rose to 94 yuan per dan due to strong interest from buyers. Subsequently, due to the vigorous output from various mountain areas, tea merchants also recognized that the tea price was too high and felt it was dangerous. They have gathered to discuss and unanimously suspended the market. As a result, market prices plummeted by 15 to 16 yuan. It is now reported that the local tea merchants and Shanghai merchants have resumed operations, but it has been agreed that tea prices will not be allowed to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Rice Market in Hexia Rises</h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, there were not many sources from various merchants. Due to weather conditions, people's sentiment was upward. Shops on both sides discussed inventory. The Start of Summer has passed, and rice prices are bound to be firm. Changshu and northern Japonica rice were slightly responsive. The opening price of Bo Dao Pu rice slightly decreased, but inventory was also low. Early rice and foreign Du Jiao were very popular. The situation stabilized. Tong Bian Yin Er Yuan arrived in four packages yesterday and were all sold on the same day. Prices jumped by about 23 cents.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Yesterday, there were more than ten sources from the interior. The demand in urban and rural stores was not very active. Changshu and northern Japonica rice and Kunshan rice each rose by 10 cents. The demand for Bo Dao Ning rice turned weaker. The local street moved slightly, and prices also increased by 5 cents. There were very few foreign Lu Jiao goods, and the situation was stable. The demand for Tong Bian Yin Hua wine was still good. The opening price rose sharply by nearly 10 cents.</p>
<h3>Large Amount of Foreign Rice for Military Needs</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River Hinterland Market is also Smooth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was extremely active. Hankou, Jiangbei, Chongming, Wuxi, Nanjing, and local retailers all made inquiries. The market situation greatly improved. Due to the need to increase shipping costs next week, the Hankou merchants were loading a lot of goods daily. Yesterday, there was even a demand for military rice, further improving the market outlook. The total market opening volume was over 15,000. However, there have been successive arrivals of goods recently. Within the next ten days, 150,000 bags of various types of rice are expected to arrive. Therefore, although sales are active, prices have not been able to rise. Yesterday's opening price for small bags was 10.03 to 10.005 yuan. The market price for special grade small bags was once as high as 10.04 yuan and 10.038 yuan, but there were no transactions. 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were priced at 11.5 yuan, and 500 bags of small bag brown rice were priced at 9.4 yuan. Also, 410 bags of Jiangxi Chen Yuan rice were priced at 13.48 yuan and 11.79 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Boosted by Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign wheat telegrams reported uniform increases in both Zhili and Henan, rising by 50 cents and 30 cents respectively. The flour market situation improved slightly, and the north experienced some demand. After the sharp price drop the day before, this aroused interest between local merchants and customers. Lower-grade flours were also sold. The opening price for May Standard Flour was as high as 2.02 yuan, then 2.03 yuan at closing, significantly higher than the previous market. The old Chepai brand opened at 2.0275 yuan. The situation seems likely to stabilize temporarily.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Sugar Suddenly Rise to Thirteen Taels</h3>
<p>Bargain Trading Quite Smooth</p>
<p>The sugar market in the sugar merchants' association was quite active, and the trend was very firm. The price of Dutch Sugar No. 24 coarse sand and white sugar rose to 13 taels. Hong Kong goods were 12 taels and 8.5 qian, later rising to 12 taels and 9 qian. There was a shortage of sellers, and the market atmosphere was quite strong, showing signs of a continued rise. Taikoo sugar was 16 taels and 3.5 qian, DY mark was 15 taels and 3 qian, and HM mark was 13 taels and 7.5 qian, all slightly higher than before, and the market trend was very promising.</p>
<h3>The Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth Market is in a State of Peace</h3>
<p>The trend of cotton cloth in this factory has stabilized recently. The sales to merchant groups are better in the north. Therefore, heavyweight coarse cloth is quite active. Yesterday, 13-pound Caishen was sold for 6 taels and 2.5 qian, 15-pound Caishen for 7 taels and 3 qian, and 16-pound Shuangyu Jiqing, etc., for more than 200 pieces. The Shantou and Xiamen merchants have purchased very little since the communal strife. Ningbo and Taizhou are also quieter than before. The sales in local stores have improved, so Jin Santa bleached cloth has risen by 5 cents to 8 taels and 5 qian. Local merchants have purchased quite a bit. The trend of fine cloth dyeing factories is wait-and-see, with only sporadic sales in local stores. Blue God, English Blue Chicken, and Balloon are selling better, while fine twill is quite sluggish. Changzhou goods are even quieter, so most are sold for 6 taels and 56 qian. Coarse twill has been quiet again recently, and prices have not changed much. Western piece goods are still sluggish. However, local interest in Elementary Fine Silk is slightly stronger. Yesterday, most of the single-strand and single-yarn products were sold for about 5 qian. Striped patterns are still stagnant.</p>
<h3>Progress in the Woolen Fabric Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric market gradually turned around. Transactions with local merchant groups were more frequent than last week. The political situation has now returned to normal, and credit is gradually easing. Business is developing accordingly. Ordering companies are willing to stamp and release accounts, and they are also very accommodating to small orders, unlike last month when they were unwilling to extend credit. Raincoat cloth, serge, fancy suiting, Zhigong Huate flannel, summer white goods, and French flannel have all been offered by the guild. Unfortunately, the selling prices in the market have not risen. This is due to the relationship between the political situation and the weather.</p>
<h3>Hardware Chess Copper Drops Five Qian</h3>
<p>Chess copper is a frequently sold item for military factories and Sichuan merchants. The annual sales volume is quite large. However, in recent years, due to the scarcity of goods in the market, prices have risen significantly, currently selling for 185 taels. However, since the price increase, the base price has been too high, causing potential buyers to hesitate, which has greatly impacted transactions. The standard has invisibly dropped by 5 qian, selling for 180 taels. However, there are still few buyers. It is expected that the price may decline further in the future.</p>
<h3>New Iron Wire Had Some Movement Yesterday</h3>
<p>New iron wire, which has been sluggish for a long time, was more lively yesterday because merchants from Sichuan and Hankou made inquiries. Although the market price has not increased temporarily, market sentiment is good, so there is no tendency to weaken. The current market price for 16 to 20 gauge is 13 taels and 2.5 qian per dan, and 21 to 25 gauge is 14 taels. Investigations have shown that market inventory is extremely low. If business picks up tomorrow, there is a risk of inventory shortages in the future.</p>

<h3>Xuzhou Middle School Students Disobey Provincial Order to Disband</h3>
<p>Dispatched Supervisor Beat, Five Students Sent to County Government for Custody</p>
<p>The situation of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education temporarily disbanding the senior high school of the Provincial Xuzhou Middle School was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The details are listed below: After the student unrest at Xuzhou Middle School, Supervisor Yi Zuolin, dispatched by the Department of Education, arrived in Xuzhou from Zhenjiang on the evening of the 2nd with Principal Xue Zhongtai. Yi carried a Department order stipulating measures to place five students, Li Gaosong, Li Ruizhu, Ma Guangjun, Yao Hezhang, and Liu Haixi, who were the leaders of the senior high school, under custody pending investigation. Three senior normal school students were expelled, their deposits were confiscated, and tuition and board fees were recovered. All senior high school students were temporarily disbanded and will be reconvened later. Junior high school classes resumed immediately. After arriving in Xuzhou, Yi stayed at the county government and borrowed a company of soldiers from the 7th Division from the military police inspectorate, and mobilized 40 police officers and public security officers. At 5:00 AM on the 3rd, they went to a courtyard of Xuzhou Middle School outside Beiguan and surrounded the inside and outside for security. Yi ordered the police to summon the five students Li, Li, Ma, Yao, and Liu, and immediately sent them to the county government for custody. The students rioted, so Yi summoned the students to the auditorium to read out the Department order. The students continued to clamor and shout, refusing to accept the Department order. Fearing that accidents might occur, Yi ordered the military police to withdraw and returned to the county government at 9:00 AM and telegraphed the province for instructions. The students in the second courtyard in the city did not participate. The students in custody were treated favorably in the Protection Committee. When the reporter interviewed Yi, Yi stated that the Department of Education had to take strict measures in order to maintain its authority and rectify the academic atmosphere. If the students obeyed the order and realized their mistakes, he would not want to sacrifice the youth's studies. He expressed his regret for the students' refusal to comply with the order and their arbitrary actions. Subsequent measures will be handled after receiving a telegram from the Department. The Department order is recorded as follows: "Case investigation of the Provincial Middle School senior high school normal department students, approaching the graduation period, there is a precedent for going out for visits. This year, during the national crisis, schools in the Beijing-Shanghai area have been affected by the war and cannot proceed as usual, and transportation in various places is mostly blocked. The order has been issued to various schools to stop all out-of-town visits. However, the Xuzhou Middle School senior high school normal department third-year students demanded to change their destination to Shandong and Beiping, threatening with a suspension of all classes and arbitrarily striking. After repeated persuasion by Principal Xue Zhongtai, the Department determined that the students' actions were out of line and ordered Principal Xue to investigate the instigators and submit them for punishment. Unexpectedly, the students of the grade not only did not repent but dared to expand the unrest, mobilizing the senior high school grades, occupying the two courtyards, expelling the principal and faculty from the school, and even threatening the entire junior high school to strike, cutting off transportation, and disrupting order. According to Principal Xue's personal report, it has been impossible to maintain the school. The senior high school students of the school have no regard for the law and insult their teachers. The circumstances are serious and should be severely punished in order to maintain discipline. The normal department third-year students Li Gaosong, Li Ruizhu, Ma Guangjun, Yao Hezhang, and Liu Haixi are identified by Principal Xue as the main instigators of the incident and should be taken into custody first pending investigation. All other third-year students in the department, except for those who requested leave for personal reasons, participated in the unrest after repeated persuasion. They are beyond redemption and should be expelled, and their deposits should be confiscated and their tuition and board fees recovered. The other senior high school grades that participated in the unrest and expanded the unrest should be temporarily disbanded for thorough rectification. The junior high school grades should immediately resume classes to emphasize their studies. For this reason, this supervisor is hereby ordered to go to the school to work with the principal to comply with this order and report for inspection. This order."</p>

Pan Xulun proposed the establishment of a large-scale vocational tutoring school as a 15th anniversary project, and Zhang Yunbo proposed launching a frugal national salvation movement. Both proposals were unanimously approved, and a committee was appointed to prepare for their implementation. Finally, Qian Xinzhi, chairman of the Society's board of directors, gave a reply, and the meeting was adjourned after a group photo was taken.</p>
<h3>Shanghai University High School Holds Filial Piety Day</h3>
<p>Since the opening of Shanghai Hujiang University in the city center, it has intensified its curriculum and focused on moral education. All school affairs are progressing as usual. It is reported that the school recently designated May 7 as Filial Piety Day to encourage students to respect their parents and follow their parents' guidance. At 11:50 AM yesterday, faculty, staff, and students gathered in the auditorium on Sichuan Road and invited the principal's wife, Mrs. Liu, to give a speech. She said that filial piety is an inherent Chinese virtue. She hoped that students would always consider how their parents love, care for, and educate their children, and not forget to be filial. They should also strive in their studies to live up to their family's expectations and extend their filial piety to love their country and nation. In this time of national crisis, we should be more determined to endure hardship and have a deep understanding. The meaning of the speech was profound and the words were very touching. After the speech, each person in attendance was presented with a flower to express the hope that parents would live long and symbolize remembrance.</p>

<h3>Morocco Beats Norway in Davis Cup</h3>
<p>Switzerland and Hungary Also Win Decisively</p>

<h3>The Important Commemoration of Mother's Day</h3>
<p>— Bi Yi</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Association, with Mother's Day, commemorated by various countries on May 8th, approaching, has sent letters to its branches, requesting that mother-child gatherings be held on this day to promote the filial piety that the association has always advocated. It also prescribed various methods to express the affection of the younger generation towards their mothers. The intention is excellent. Some may say that the Book of Odes says, "Pitiful, pitiful are our parents, who bore me with such toil." It is the parents who should be commemorated. Since the toil is the same, it is appropriate to consider them equally and not to place undue emphasis on the mother. However, if one examines the reality, the mother's suffering in childbirth and raising children is even greater. A folk song from farming families says, "Ten months of pregnancy, the mother suffers; three years of breastfeeding, the mother toils." It is a true depiction. The saying, "A fake tune cannot compare to a real folk song," is indeed true. From these two phrases, one knows that the mother bears a greater responsibility than the father, so her kindness in toiling is even greater than the father's. Although the hardship of breastfeeding is often delegated to others by those who are able to hire a wet nurse, it is better for a child to be fed with its own mother's milk, as physiologists have explained in detail. Moreover, how can ordinary people without the means shirk this heavy responsibility? Mr. Gui Zhenchuan's "Biography of My Late Mother" is a piece that everyone reads and wants to weep. It says, "The older ones tug at her clothes, the younger ones are breastfed; the needlework in her hands never stops." The toil of poor mothers is vividly depicted. Furthermore, the hardship of pregnancy and the difficulty of childbirth cannot be avoided by anyone, whether noble or rich, who cannot shirk the responsibility of toiling and hire someone to replace them. Therefore, the commemoration of Mother's Day should be regarded as especially important. This is not just from the perspective of the Women's Association itself, but simply knowing that there is a mother. When it says that the association has always advocated filial piety, it means that the kindness of both parents is remembered.</p>
<h3>On Danzig</h3>
<p>— Kai Xu</p>
<p>Recently, according to European newspapers, Poland had an attempt to annex the Free City of Danzig, but it ultimately did not become a reality due to the intervention of neighboring countries. Afterwards, the Polish authorities and various related parties issued statements of clarification, stating that the rumors were groundless. The actions of fierce warlords in various countries around the world are all the same, invading people's lands and occupying them as their own. If the rumors were not without basis, the clarification would also be meddlesome. The Free City of Danzig is located on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, with the Vistula River running through it, making it a central hub for European commerce and a strategically important place for land and naval military affairs. Surrounding powers, such as Germany, Russia, Poland, Prussia, Sweden, and Denmark, are all watching with covetous eyes, each wanting to fulfill their ambition to swallow it. However, Danzig, with its small area and 400,000 people, has been able to resist strong neighbors from outside its borders and maintain the dignity of an independent country. Alas, how does it compare to the demise of our three northeastern provinces in an instant? Danzig establishes a country with a single city, while our country has ten thousand times its area and cannot establish a country. In the Middle Ages, Danzig once fought England with thousands of undisciplined troops, defeated them, and captured the mayor of London, causing England not to dare to despise it for its small size for hundreds of years. Later, it was defeated once by Poland. Poland, with the prestige of victory, could have fulfilled its ambition to swallow it, but ultimately feared its people's spirit and allowed its independence. Between Poland and Danzig, they regarded each other as enemies. All documents between the Polish king and Danzig were mainly in Latin or German, and they never dared to use Polish. This is due to the unyielding spirit of the Teutonic people. Later, Poland was divided and perished by neighboring countries, but Danzig alone was able to maintain its autonomy. The people of Danzig are Germans, but the Germans also had no intention of annexing it. Later, based on the desire for national self-determination, it became attached to Germany. After World War I, Poland was restored, and Danzig was a port connecting Poland to the sea, but it was ultimately not given to Poland. It was only opened up as a belt area for Poland to access the sea and named the Polish Corridor. However, Poland found the corridor circuitous and inconvenient, so its ambition to annex Danzig never waned. But how could it achieve its wish? Alas, when I think of this, I cannot help but sigh deeply. I would rather be a free citizen of a small country than a slave of a large country.</p>
<p>Records of Polishing the Sword</p>
<h3>Mr. Liang</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Mr. Liang, I forget his name, was a neighbor's son in the past. He was physically strong and liked sports. At that time, the school had sports meets, and many people came to watch. Liang ran and jumped in the sports meet, repeatedly winning championships, showing off his manly skills. He was young and handsome, truly a lovable child. When the Xinhai Revolution army revolted in Wuchang, Liang rolled up his sleeves and said, "In the past, the young boy Wang Qi of Lu could take up arms to defend his country. Although I am young, I am older than Wang Qi. How can I not fulfill my duty as a citizen?" So he went to join the army secretly behind his family's back. He was in</p>
<p>Wuhan for several months, was wounded and returned. He regretted not being able to die on the battlefield. His family was surprised by this. From then on, Liang no longer sought education. When Mr. Niu Yongjian organized a student army in Songjiang during the Second Revolution, Liang again secretly went to join it. His family could not stop him. When the revolutionary army attacked the Shanghai Arsenal, the student army especially bravely charged forward, most of them sacrificing their lives under a hail of bullets. Liang was also among them. Unfortunately, the effort failed, and the student army disbanded invisibly. Liang's news disappeared without a trace. His family waited for his return, but he was not seen for a long time. They inquired everywhere but could not find out whether he was alive or dead. They thought that Liang had already sacrificed himself on the battlefield. Now, when the Shanghai War started, there were student armies participating, killing the enemy effectively and sacrificing themselves for the country. If Mr. Liang were still alive, he would surely roll up his sleeves and rise up again. How pitiful is this child!</p>
<h3>Record of the Double Towers in Military Affairs (45)</h3>
<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Pitifully Forced into an Alliance Under the Bed in the Night of Shared Dreams; Still Remembering the Promise Neglected by the Window During First Love</p>
<p>Now, let's not rush into those things first. After you agree to my proposal, please first choose a date to announce our engagement and hold our wedding. Although you are currently in mourning, a large-scale event is a bit inconvenient, but inviting a few</p>
<p>close friends as witnesses and announcing it in the newspaper is essential to complete all the procedures, so that outsiders understand that this is a formal and legal marriage. Please give me a decision tonight so that it can be implemented as soon as possible. You shouldn't have any more excuses, right? As he spoke, he was composed and elegant, and lit another cigarette, waiting for An Yutian's answer. At this time, An Yutian had already been forced to surrender to the alliance under the bed and was preparing to submit a letter of surrender as soon as possible. However, upon hearing about the engagement and wedding, two pressing matters, he suddenly remembered Li Wenxia, who had made the same proposal the previous night. He couldn't help but secretly cry out in distress. This marriage is not a trivial matter. Once a promise has been made to one person, it cannot be lightly promised to a second person. It just so happened that the situation in these two days had become so strange, with one wave not yet settled and another rising. The first person was fiercely demanding the fulfillment of the old agreement and had not yet been properly dealt with, while the second person took the opportunity to propose a new alliance and was eager for a quick solution. Now he was in a dilemma and unable to take care of both. Surrendering to the second person in front of him would be like liking the new and forgetting the old. How would he deal with the first person in the future? If he insisted on prioritizing the old relationship and rejected the second person, he would regret his recklessness and falling into this dense spider web. In the end, there was no way to explain this rash act of defiling her purity for no reason. Moreover, he even thought of the serious time tonight, which was also the most important time he had agreed with Li Wenxia to wait for her at the apartment last night to discuss important matters together. How could the same kind of major event have replaced an opponent and a place for no reason, moving here to create new complications and joking with Liang Xiaoyun? And how could he have been so confused and forgotten his appointment with Li Wenxia last night in the past few hours, and relied on himself here to find even greater trouble? He truly couldn't forgive himself. He felt extremely sorry for both Li Wenxia and Liang Xiaoyun. For a moment, he was full of panic and drenched in sweat. He blurted out his heart's disease, saying, "This...this is fine, but I...I have done a terrible thing before. I had a promise of marriage with another woman. Now, it doesn't matter what formal actions you and I take. But that woman is not guaranteed not to have... objections."</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<h3>Assassination Incidents</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>Assassination is originally the most cruel and brutal thing, but in the aspect of using this means, people naturally think that there is "no way to go" and have no choice but to take this last resort. Unexpectedly, such cruel and brutal incidents would occur in three countries at the same time within two days, which is very unfortunate.</p>
<p>One, Paris, 6th dispatch: French President Doumer was attacked by a rioter today and shot five times in a row. Doumer was shot three times and has tragically died.</p>
<p>One, Madrid, 5th dispatch: The Spanish capital recently discovered a conspiracy to assassinate Prime Minister Aznar and an attempt to assassinate President Zamora.</p>
<p>One, Cairo, 6th dispatch: Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky and other famous politicians were traveling to Ghamra Station when a bomb exploded moments before, fortunately escaping unscathed.</p>
<p>Although the above three assassination cases have no connection, or belong to foreign countries, or belong to domestic countries, there is no need to discuss the causes and inside stories before clarifying the truth. But to put it in one sentence, it must contain political colors, it can be asserted.</p>
<p>According to today's newspaper, the murderer Go Guoloff who assassinated the French president confessed that during the European War, the White Russians participated in the war, which helped France a lot. Now that the White Russians have failed to this point, and France is standing by, not lending a hand, so he took this action. Whether this confession is reliable is unknown, but the White Russians have been miserably defeated, and the Red Russians have been in power for many years. Why only think of revenge today? It is very doubtful. The details of the other two cases are even more unknown.</p>
<p>However, the creation of an assassination case must have two objects. Party A wants to implement its own claims and refuses to accommodate Party B's claims, and Party B's claims have nowhere to be implemented, so they resort to this cruel and brutal means. This reason is very clear, so when an assassination case occurs, the politics of the country, whether foreign or domestic, must be in a state of precariousness. This is a clear and common rule.</p>
<p>The public has its own reasons, and the mother-in-law has her own reasons. Both sides and each has a reason. Is it the public's reason? Or is it the mother-in-law's reason? The right and wrong of both sides can be ignored. The public will definitely not accommodate the mother-in-law's claims, and the mother-in-law will definitely not accommodate the public's claims. Both sides cannot be open and honest, and work together in harmony, so the extremists have no other choice but to resort to this cruel means. This is also a definite and common rule.</p>
<p>I sincerely mourn the misfortune of the French president and am deeply worried about the general politicians.</p>

<h3>Two Poems Expressing Feelings</h3>
<p>— Ge Chuan Kui</p>
<p>For five years, I have served in the English Department of the Commercial Press Translation Institute, associating with English classics every day, purchasing dozens of Western books, and writing several volumes of annotations on famous works. After the Shanghai Incident, everything was reduced to ashes. I was inspired to write this.</p>
<p>For years, I have been immersed in crab-like writing, loving to read Western books as if they were classics and tombs. How could I have known that Heaven would still be stingy with me, turning everything into ashes? What else is there to say?</p>
<p>Commenting on poems and essays takes a long time, carefully choosing words and phrases and spending time on thinking. If I had known that everything would become ashes today, I would laugh at myself for being too foolish in the beginning.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Ink Manufacturing Method</h3>
<p>By Nai Zheng</p>
<p>Ink is widely used. Whether it is teachers and students in schools or in business offices and writing rooms, they all need it. In the past, the ink on the market was all imported. In recent years, there has also been domestic ink production. Speaking of manufacturing ink, it is not a very difficult thing, but to make it very good, you must have a large capital to purchase machinery to manufacture it.</p>
<p>To make ink, you only need to slightly prepare glass utensils and other things as follows:</p>
<p>A soy sauce bottle, the finished ink can be stored inside. An old ink bottle, the ink is stored inside for writing. A funnel, a piece of summer cloth, a small enamel pot or basin, one or two small bamboo or wooden sticks. These tools are generally sufficient for making various inks.</p>
<p>Black Ink (Black Ink) Gallic Powder (Pulo Gallic) Four ounces (4oz) Boiling Water Two pounds (Q pint)</p>
<p>Iron Sulphate Solution (Solution) One and a half ounces (1 1/2 oz) Gum Arabic Three quarters of an ounce (3/4 oz) Creosote Two or three drops.</p>
<p>The above medicines can be bought in Western pharmacies or instrument stores. Together, their price is less than five dimes. But if you make it, it can turn into a soy sauce bottle.</p>
<p>The manufacturing is very convenient. We first soak the gallic powder in boiling water for one day and night. (If the water is cold, there is no need to add heat) Then take the summer cloth and filter it, put it in a small basin, and then take the ferrous sulfate, dissolve it in water, and after it is completely dissolved, you can put it in the small basin together, then add the gum arabic, and then stir it with a small stick to make it even, and at the same time add two or three drops of creosote. At this time, the ink is successful, and you can use a funnel to pour it into the soy sauce bottle for storage. When you use it, just pour some into the old ink, and when it's used up, pour some more. It's very convenient, but the old ink bottle must be thoroughly cleaned the first time. I will now introduce a blue ink as follows:</p>
<p>Gallic Powder, three and a half ounces, Indigo Sulfate, two and a half ounces, Iron Sulphate Solution, two and a half ounces, Cloves, a little, Gum Arabic, one and a half ounces, Clean water, two pounds (pints)</p>
<p>The method is exactly the same as above. Its color is a very beautiful blue and is very durable when written on paper.</p>
<p>Finally, I must explain clearly that these two formulas are probably from a book (Ink Manufacture), but it may not be this book. Recently, I happily went to a Western pharmacy to buy some medicines and went home to make them, but I was too impatient. The gallic was soaked in water, and I soaked it for the time I ate dinner, and then I added the other medicines. As a result, it was a great failure, the color was very light. Later, after studying it, I realized that the problem was that the gallic was not soaked thoroughly. The second time I did it was not bad, and the third and fourth times, I improved even more. As for the ingredients in the above formula, I have already slightly changed them, they are the ingredients of the best result. It is not very good to make them according to the ingredients in the English book. I think they will definitely not tell us the good ingredients. This point depends on one's own flexibility, research, experimentation, and improvement.</p>
<p>End of the Street</p>
<h3>After the War</h3>
<p>— Yu Xian</p>
<p>I happened to be strolling on Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>Nanjing Road is still Nanjing Road before the war. The stylish cars seem to be running like a busy street. The Indian Sikh is still brandishing his stick and hitting the backs of rickshaw pullers. In the huge glass windows, eye-catching advertisements are decorated. Of course, the electric lights are lit very beautifully day and night, and our young masters and misses are also wearing novel clothes, adding a lot of color to the spring in Shanghai.</p>
<p>There are no traces of war here.</p>
<p>I happened to be strolling on Minguo Road.</p>
<p>Minguo Road will restore Minguo Road before the war. The iron sheds are opening one after another. The Chinese who took refuge in the concession during the war have moved back. The stores have opened. (Never mind their long-term resistance and painful opening) The most notable thing is that the barbed wire and sandbags have disappeared unconsciously.</p>
<p>There will be no traces of war here.</p>
<p>I dare not go to Wusong to take a walk.</p>
<p>I am afraid that the painful traces will always remain, causing me a bad feeling.</p>
<p>Birth</p>
<h3>What I Saw at the Bund Park</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Although you can't see a trace of national disaster on the faces of lovers, men and women, and the soldiers of country X, from the pedestrians on the road and the audience in the movie theaters, the spring travelers by the West Lake and on Longhua Road this year are still colder than in previous years, right? In the past three months, even I, who have nothing to do with family or country, have felt no desire to go for a spring outing and no desire to see a movie. It was not until the afternoon of the day before yesterday that I happened to pass through the Bund and took the opportunity to spend two dimes to take a walk in the Bund Park and breathe some relatively fresh air.</p>
<p>However, it would have been better not to go in. After walking in, I got quite a few sad impressions. Everything in the Bund Park still remains unchanged from the past. The red flowers and green trees clearly tell me that the god of spring has descended for a long time. Blue-eyed, high-nosed Western men, holding slender-waisted, full-breasted Western women, walk straight in the park. Of course, the majority of the tourists in the park are our Chinese, men, women, old and young. Their faces are filled with smiles and are whispering sweet nothings.</p>
<p>Among these tourists, the most noticeable are of course those Westernized modern men and women. Pairs of them, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, sit on iron-framed chairs, either making eye contact or looking at the scenery across the river. During this period of late spring and early summer, it is naturally an unparalleled pleasure in life to tour the red peach blossoms and green willows with a lover, and to exchange endless sweet nothings. Where do they still think of Zhabei being invaded and Wusong being forcibly seized?</p>
<p>Leaning on the iron railing, looking across the river, our line of sight, as long as it shoots to the center of the river, will see several ships of country X moored in the gray and yellow waves. The flag of country X is fluttering in the wind. The ships are full of joyful air. Some are singing victorious military songs loudly. Inconsistent songs are faintly sent into my eardrums from afar. Some are looking at everything on the riverside on the deck. Their line of sight may sometimes come into contact with the people in the park, revealing an arrogant attitude, mocking us Chinese who have nothing.</p>
<p>How embarrassing, how sad, my tears couldn't help but flow down. Let's go, I really don't want to see this kind of scene anymore.</p>
<p>There Are</p>
<h3>True or False?</h3>
<p>— Wu Wei</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I went to the theater to have tea. Three tea drinkers came to the table next to me. I heard some wonderful theories, no, maybe it was nonsense.</p>
<p>A: When China and Japan were at war, the City God, Lord Guan, and Lord Yue were all helping in the sky.</p>
<p>B: Oh, no wonder the enemy kept suffering defeats... But, how do you know?</p>
<p>A: The Pure Yang Patriarch said it when he descended on the altar in our neighbor's spirit medium temple...</p>
<p>C: Yes, when the fighting was tight, I went to the City God Temple to ask for a divination stick. For more than five minutes, the stick wouldn't fall out!...</p>
<p>B: What happened then?</p>
<p>C: Later, the incense keeper told me to wait a moment. He told me that the City God was very busy recently and often went out...</p>
<p>A: How long did you wait then?</p>
<p>C: Later, I waited for a full twenty minutes. The incense keeper said he was here, and told me to look at the City God's forehead, which had a lot of sweat on it?...</p>
<p>A: Really?</p>
<p>C: Of course, I saw it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>B: Oh, no wonder my wife bought a piece of tin foil and a few pairs of straw sandals once and said she would take them to the City God Temple to burn. She also said that the neighbor told her that the City God had entrusted a dream to the incense keeper saying that he wanted silver and straw sandals. I didn't believe it at first...</p>
<p>"..................." I heard this and saw that the sky seemed to be about to rain, so I got up and left.</p>
<p>Inconceivable</p>
<h3>A Few Words</h3>
<p>— Xin Xiu</p>
<p>Last Saturday night, I visited a friend. Several friends were gathered at his house, talking about the status of their respective industries after the Songhu War. I sat down and listened quietly.</p>
<p>The manager of a domestic goods cloth wholesale store shook his head and frowned, saying, "It's terrible. Those of us who rely on selling cloth from this factory are really going to starve to death. Usually, the sales of factory cloth, except in those places where the customs are not very open, and the generally unadorned people who value simplicity still welcome it, the more so-called civilized ports, the less people ask about domestic goods cloth. But I thought that after this painful Shanghai Incident, the general public would be stimulated like this, and the sales of our factory cloth might have a turning point. Who knew that the business of Wang Laohe was still thriving!"</p>
<p>Wang Laohe replied with a smile, "Not necessarily. However, the newly arrived batches of patterned cloths have very good colors and patterns, so sales may be better. I most envy Mr. Zhang, whose business is the best. As long as you get a light-on license, regardless of whether the market is good or bad, the general old guns always patronize every day, rain or shine. This is simply better than opening a rice shop. Those unemployed poor people who have no money to buy rice and cook can also muddle through a meal with a few coppers. However, this problem of 'eating black rice' is much more difficult than 'eating white rice.' When the addiction comes, it's truly like 'mourning one's parents,' with tears and snot, very sad. Therefore, Mr. Zhang's store is always full of guests every day, and profits triple!"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang smiled and said to a young man in a suit, "The most developed business is your industry! Look, among the 400 million people in the country now, let alone a few, there are 200 million people who smoke cigarettes. It's truly become so widespread, regardless of the rich or poor, men or women, old or young! If we make a statistic of the money we spend on cigarettes throughout the year, the total amount must be surprisingly large! Compared with our industry, it's simply incomparable."</p>
<p>Mr. Li, the bookstore manager, sighed, "Everyone's business is good, but my book business is truly a bitter meal. Usually, except for a portion of romance, love, and sex books that still have some sales, the rest of the textbooks and literary books are simply unattended all day long. We sit in the store, watching the generally student-like young men in suits and modern ladies go to dance halls and movie theaters, all passing us by without entering - now we don't even have enough for daily expenses. What should we do?"</p>
<p>When everyone heard this, they were all listless and went back separately.</p>
<p>Bamboo Root</p>
<h3>Drifting</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lai</p>
<p>Due to the war, the word "drifting" has unfortunately been added to our lives.</p>
<p>Originally, living a drifting life is a great misfortune in life. Usually, when I see groups of drifters on the street, I hate that social undertakings are declining and cannot accommodate those young and useful people. On the one hand, I think they are self-indulgent, so they are ostracized by society, but at the same time, I deeply feel the pain of unemployment. Because they are unfortunate and unemployed, they turn into drifters. If our rice bowl is broken, aren't we the same as them? Therefore, those who wander on the thorny road of society are all filled with the terror of drifting.</p>
<p>The day before the flames of war engulfed Zhabei, I was originally preparing to go to school to attend class, but upon hearing the unfortunate news, I returned home dejectedly. From then on, I drifted all day long in villages with rows of green willows, drifted in fields of yellow flowers and green wheat, drifted on avenues with fragrant grass. However, such drifting also allowed me to appreciate a flavor, enough to wash away all the miscellaneous thoughts in my heart. It can truly be said to be joy in suffering.</p>
<p>The wind is getting tighter. I boarded a small boat and went to Chongming, drifting for twenty days. I ate the exotic dishes there, saw the famous scenic spots there, and the schools and customs of Chongming were all deeply imprinted in my ears and eyes. Such drifting made me almost think I was in a foreign country, not knowing that the west of the Huangpu River was already under the iron hooves of the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Movies</h3>

<h3>Corrections</h3>
<p>In the May 1st issue, there was a sentence saying "Xu Xilin's rule." According to Xu, he was the superintendent of the Higher Police School. This is incorrect.

Upon reviewing the petition, it is noted that this court, due to a petition from the Shanghai New Medicine Trade Association to purchase Huang Chu Jiu Hospital, held a hearing on April 29th of this year. After the agents of both parties agreed to first announce a public auction of the real estate, it was decided that if no higher bid was received, the association would be allowed to purchase it. As this method does not harm the interests of creditors, it is not appropriate to change it again. The petitioner's request for a temporary suspension of the public auction and a copy of the Shanghai New Medicine Trade Association's petition for investigation shall not be considered. This instruction. ▲ One case: Kingsbury et al. request registration for adopting a young girl. Upon reviewing the petition, this instruction. ▲ One case: Chen Fengbao petitions to withdraw the judgment of exclusion. Upon reviewing the petition, permission is granted to withdraw the petition. This instruction. ▲ One case: Da Li petitions for execution. Upon reviewing the petition, it is found that the second-instance judgment in this case has not been served because the debtor's address is unknown, and therefore the judgment has not been finalized. The requested execution should be delayed. This instruction. ▲ One case: The Shanghai New Medicine Trade Association petitions to be allowed to purchase the Huang Chu Jiu Hospital buildings and land at the highest bid. Upon reviewing the petition, permission is requested to purchase the Huang Chu Jiu Hospital buildings and land at the stated price. After summoning both parties, they both stated that they still requested the auction to continue according to the previous method and court ruling. Only if no one offers a higher price should the Shanghai New Medicine Trade Association be allowed to purchase at the highest bid. Given the previous circumstances and the interests of both parties, this matter should be delayed before an auction is held. This instruction. ▲ One case: Xie Mao Hang's agent, lawyer Zhou Xiao'an et al., petitions to receive funds. Upon reviewing the petition, the funds obtained from the auction of Zheng Honghui's property, previously deposited with this court, should be collected at the court at 9:00 AM on the 9th of this month. This instruction. ▲ One case: Li Xing San petitions for an order to deliver funds. Upon reviewing the petition, it is noted that the Shanghai Local Court previously requested assistance in placing a preliminary attachment on the shares of Chen Hongxiang's Quanfu Gong Paper Shop. Regarding the requested matter, this court has not yet received a letter from the Shanghai Local Court requesting execution, so it should be handled after the letter arrives. This instruction. (The above is dated May 7th)</p>

This instruction. ▲ One case: Ti Que Nao Fusige declares the types of evidence and requests to receive them.

This instruction. ▲ One case: Dong Puqing petitions for an extension of execution. Upon reviewing the petition, it is noted that the movable property of the debtor Jiang Runzhi has already been appraised, and another creditor, Yu Kunzhi, is involved. According to law, the cases should be combined for execution. The request for an extension is granted for two weeks, after which the auction will proceed.

Upon reviewing the petition, as the detention of the debtor Wang Shouquan is about to expire, the request to entrust the Shanghai First Special District Local Court to assist in the execution of his movable property should be approved.
