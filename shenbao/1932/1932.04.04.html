<p>時評</p>
<h3>第一届兒童節獻辭彬</h3>
<p>今天是中華民國第一届兒童節。是中國成千成萬活潑天眞的兒童們最値得紀念的一天。亦即中國的政府。敎育當局成千成萬的父兄和幼穉敎育家。最應注意的一天。</p>
<p>有人説十九世紀是婦女的世紀。二十世紀是兒童的世紀這即是説十九世紀是婦女解放的時代。二十世紀是兒童解放的時代自從一九二五年八月國際兒童幸福促進會。曾在比京布魯塞爾舉行第一次國際大會定下了關於保護兒童權利的五條原則以後。世界各國都已開始注意到兒童問題了。這是兒童前途於曙光。亦即人類前途的曙光從擺在我們眼前的事實上看。兒童所受的壓迫是最爲深重而又最爲我們所忽視。甚且公認爲合理。父兄們都把兒童當作自己私有的財產同時更認爲兒童們是不識不知。儼然把自己看做偉大的智慧者於是朿縛兒童們底純潔意志。摧殘他們底蓬。勃生機。桎梏他們底偉大生命强制兒童的意志使適合於自己的意志。蔑視兒童的力量。一切代之以自己的力量使兒童們沒有自由。沒有活力。如像牛馬一樣在主人的鞭策之下機械地順從使喚安受豢養。在這樣的父兄與幼穉敎育家的手裏眞不知斷送了多少偉大的生命。眞不知斷送了多少生機蓬勃的兒童。這是一種罪惡。是一筆大至無可估計的損失。所以我們應該爲成千成萬被壓迫的兒童爆發一次偉大的革命</p>
<p>至於我國的兒童所受的壓迫與苦痛。更較任何一國尤爲深重由於政治的黑暗與大多數人民生計的窮蹙。成千成萬的兒童都隨着他們的父兄在飢餓之下。掙扎生命。陜甘前年旱荒。災民們易子而食幾成爲尋常事嬰兒的死亡率。爲千分之五百四十。僅次於印度。至於兒童敎育更是談不到全國四千三百萬學齡兒。童。得享受讀書權利的。僅六百五十萬。被剝奪讀書權利的竟達百分之八十以上父母不僅是把小孩看做私有的財產且認爲養育小孩。完全是爲了養老與傳宗。『養兒防老』與『積穀防饑』是大多數人所堅持的傳統哲學。所以中國的兒童。在今日尤其應該立即爆發一次偉大的革命。</p>
<p>我們認爲兒童自有其偉大的生命兒童們活潑的自然的純潔的生命絶非成人所能體解。更絶不容成人加以桎梏。而且兒童是未來社會的主人兒童的前途即是社會的前途。人類的前途。我們應該發揚兒童們的生命力。使其成爲新時代的創造者絶不容加以桎梏。使其成爲舊時代的承繼者。父兄與幼穉敎育家的手裏。實掌握着社會與人類的前途。所以重新估量重新體認把握在自己手裏的幼苗的價値與生命。是當前最切要的工作。我們認爲生存應該機會均等。敎育也應該機均等。政府坐視千千萬萬的兒童失學。這是政府的無能。坐視千千萬萬的兒童在飢餓之下掙扎其小生命。更不啻殺減兒童。所以我們在今日。切盼政府不止於頒布兒童節而更進一步的爲兒童謀健康與敎育上種種幸福之增進發揚兒童的生命力養成未來時代健全的主人。</p>
<p>在今天。我們當爲成千成萬的兒童祝福。當爲未來的中華民族祝福。</p>

<h3>川同鄉會致政府電</h3>
<p>四川旅滬同鄉會、昨致國府電云、淞滬陷落、迄今已一月於茲矣、此一月以來、吾民所受異族之侵凌、已去朝鮮台灣而不遠、爲之政府者、當如何努力殺敵、以出吾民於水火、乃鈞府始終依賴國際調停、謀與日方妥協、雖日事宣言抵抗、究不見收復失地、據連日停戰會議所表現者、尤令人懷疑殊甚、第一、鈞府旣一再宣言不撤兵不交涉、何以又有此撤兵之交涉、彼撤兵則撤兵矣、有何交涉可言、撤兵而言交涉、非有意承受喪權辱國之條件乎、第二·所謂日本撤兵者、當係指退出中國境内而言、何以日軍退駐吳淞江灣閘北一帶、便認爲彼己撤兵、而承認開圓桌會議、試問此與城下之盟、有何異乎、第三、東省與上海兩案、不能分開解决、爲鈞府所宣示於人民者、何以對於滬案、竟承認單獨開圓桌會議、此豈非有意中日方之詭計、將東小斷送乎、第四、中國軍隊駐中國境内、誰人得而限制、何以鈞府竟承認我軍暫駐原地、聽候圓桌會議解决、其所謂保持土地行政之完整也者、果何在乎、以上四點、在鈞府解釋、自必曰一切皆暫局、撤兵限期一到、圓桌會議一開、則淞　滬必回復原狀矣、但鈞府亦會憶及第一次　聯决議、對於日本撤兵、非亦定　限期乎、而今日東省之日兵、究竟撤退也未、吾人相信、在今日情勢下、國際公約已成廢紙、世界公理更屬空談、除却以武力收復失地一途外、東省固已矣、即淞滬亦必至淪爲東省第二、倘鈞府不此之圖、而能憑外交之力、以保金甌無缺、本會同人、實顧抉目以懸國門、用祝諸公之勝利、特是終成幻想耳、東省陷失、旣己逾半年、而淞滬失守、今日又爲週月紀念日、鈞府之信賴國聯、其效果何若、吾人慘痛之餘、深覺今日之事、不降即戰、切望鈞府毋忘國民革命之意義、與民族主義之精神、迅即振起堂堂之師、驅逐日兵出境、</p>
<p>以收復我淞滬及東省失地、而獲取我中華民族之獨立自由、苟不幸而以長期抵抗爲名、以長期拖延爲實、或竟爲保持個人地位與實力、不惜犧牲民族利益與人格、則一般國民、是否尙聽命于國民政府、恐非吾人所忍言者也、　言奉凟、請勿以逆耳而置之、是幸、四川旅滬同鄉會叩、江印、</p>

<h3>馬衛里論東北問題與國際聯盟（續昨）翰</h3>
<p>（五）歐洲政治家與外交家之錯覺　但我人若以一切猶太人的罪惡、（即狡滑不負責任）均加諸美政府之身、未免不公、蓋華盛頓方面所表示之空氣、與其他列强首都所表示者、並無甚大之出入、歐洲方面之政治家與外交家、其本能的反動、並不有利於中國、此亦無可諱言者、其理由亦不一、外交家多數對於國聯及戰後</p>
<p>之新國際公法、均不甚信仰、且自然之趨勢、關於此事件不得不讓外交家中遠東問題之專家發言、而若輩在遠東任職期中、又莫不因不平等條約問題、與中國</p>
<p>發生一度之齟齬、於是日人即乘隙施用手段、以條約神聖之保障者自負、尤其是關於不平等條約、使全世界外交家均有日本爲各國共同利益而爭之感相、</p>
<p>至歐洲政治家之所懼、則認盟約嚴格履行、其制裁手段、恐非目前世界情形所許、日本政府對於此種情形、最爲熟悉、故其手段至爲敏捷、此我人所不得不承認者也、日本在歐洲宣傳、弦外之音、一若滿州之問題、乃一遵守條約之問題、是故日本所辯護者、適爲歐洲各國所正欲絶大犧牲之權利、日本政府且在東京聲言、日本將不顧國聯之命令、斷然實行武力的制裁、此種景象、使歐洲之政治家非常惶恐、而此時之憂慮、正在非常嚴重中矣、</p>
<p>（六）國聯竟受秘密約定之牽制但我人經過此種種察以後、尙不能藐視另一觀察之重要、我人今日生存之時代、乃一過渡之時代、新的國際公法之實行、仍不免受國聯存在以前、及最近種種秘密約定之牽制、在國聯之空氣、人人皆知行政會之懦弱、大半由於日本與列强間關於滿州問題之秘密約定、此種種秘密約定、並無法律的價値、此種種秘密約定、旣未向國聯秘書　登記、又與盟約相反、實陷於雙重之無效、但我人此時所重視者、非此種種約定之法律價値、而爲一般人認欲遵守此種種約定之事實、以致若輩在國聯行政會中之行動、表現懦弱、且至於呆滯不動、凡此諸點、皆足以解釋國聯爲何不敢明白施行盟約之規定、</p>
<p>（七）中國交外手腕之錯誤最後爲解析完善計、猶須追加一點、中國政府方面、不敢斷然使行政會負全部責任、假若中國早具更有力之軍事抵抗、則日本亦决難推託滿州事件决非戰爭、假若中國早就提出第十五條、則行政會亦决難圖卸責任、而糾紛之兩造、旣無須投票、則十月二十四日之决議、亦不致於不發生强制的性質、是故中國方面、在外交手腕上、亦嘗減弱生政會之行動、使行政會不期然而然趨於不動之情勢、此則非我人所欲訾議者也、</p>
<p>（八）世界未來之凶兆總之此事使國聯之怨恨、實甚於中國、蓋中國猶得相當事實之滿意、如滿州調查團之委派、可使中國得在公正無私之法庭前、呈訴一切、滿州所發生之種種爭執、由來已久、其原因皆由於種種權利之内容、及其是不合法、糢糊不定故也、日本出其不意、驟進滿州、固從未料及竟致給與一種機會、使世界人士注意一日本所欲單獨注意之地方、關於此點、國聯調查團、可以有相當</p>
<p>之實際價値、而不容藐視、國聯調查團所貢獻於中國者、當爲嚴正的滿意、</p>
<p>反之、國聯自身對於此次事件、實無可自慶、行政會之弱點、己證明國聯之行動、可以受國聯所絶未認識之秘密約定的牽制、此實爲未來之凶兆、而我人適在軍縮會議之際、安全問題、適爲該會之主要關鍵、此一預兆、尤非佳祥也、凡此種種、甫經過去之事實、皆足以貽人口實、使人有破壞軍縮會議之强有力的理由、行政會之行動、所以不能稍示剛毅者、其亦在於斯乎、（完）</p>

<p>以告國人、</p>
<h3>在兒童節告全國成人們陳鶴琴</h3>
<p>現在的兒童是將來的國民、這句話是誰也知道誰也不能否認的、兒童旣然是將來的國民、那麽將來我們的國家社會能否繁榮、全看這些兒童現在有無良好的敎育和將來能否成爲良好的國民、至於如何敎育兒童、使他們成爲良好的國民、這就是我們成人的唯一重任了、</p>
<p>講到敎育兒童先要明瞭兒童的生理和心理、曉得兒童身體方面的性質、和心理方面發展的程序、才可以曉得怎樣去敎他們、怎樣去育他們、使他們發育强健的身體、養成良好的習慣、獲得豐富的經騐和知識、成爲健全的國民、爲我們將來的國家社會盡力、</p>
<p>我們現在先就兒童的生理講、兒童身體的外觀、好像和成人是一樣的、實際上可就不然、頭及四肢和身體的比例旣然和成人大不相同、骨骼的構造、血液的密度、以及腸胃的消化力、亦相差遠甚、因爲手足短小、骨骼柔軟的原故、兒童應當有兒童的小桌椅和適合身量的衣服、否則長短高低、不與身體相稱、不但發育方面將大受影響、體格上或恐要變畸形、因爲兒童消化力不如成人的原故、就應當吃富於滋養而容易消化的食物、可是就現在社會上一般成人對於兒童的觀念和態度看來、實在離開上面條件太遠了、公共塲所旣然缺乏兒童的設備、家庭中間大槪都把成人當做中心、吃的方面勉强着兒童吃成人吃的東西、坐的方面勉强兒童坐成人坐的大桌椅、穿的方面也勉强兒童穿成人式樣的衣服、一切生活都拿成人做標準、兒童好像是具體而微的小成人一樣、這種蔑視兒童地位、戕賊兒童特性的事實、是非常危險的、所以我們現在第一急務、是要把兒童當作兒童看待、換一句話説、就是兒童在社會上應該占有相當的地位、得到相當的待遇、</p>
<p>再從兒童的心理方面講、兒童是好遊戲的、好模仿的、好奇的、我們單就兒童好模仿的一層講、兒童不到一歲的時候、就會模仿簡單的聲音和簡單的動作、比如鷄啼狗呌、刷牙洗面等一類簡單的聲調和動作、他們一聽到一看見、就會模仿的、到了兩歲的時候、這種模仿能力漸漸發展、如掃地洗衣等比較複雜的動作、看到就會模仿了、到了三四歲的時候、模仿的能力、就非常發達、如籌祭喜慶、以及公共集會等儀式、兒童看到了都會隨時模仿、因爲看見就模仿的緣故、各種習慣就此漸漸地養成、這時候社會環境、和家庭中間成人的一舉一動、在在都可以影響到兒童的品性、兒童如果聽到家庭裏常常駡人的聲音、就不知不覺的也會駡人、看到成人隨地吐痰、也不知不覺的隨地吐痰、他們不曉得駡人是好是壞、也不曉得隨地吐痰是好是壞、不過看見成人做、也就這樣做、久而久之就會成爲習慣、所以做父母的、第一是要自己在品性和</p>
<p>生活的方各面、處處以身作則、第二是要選擇良好的環境、使兒童所見所聞都是好的事物、所模仿的也都是好的動作、無形之中、就可以呌他們養成良好的習慣、和良好的品性、孟母三　的故事、就是最好的一个例證、</p>

<p>雖然兒童者實世界之主人翁也、今日之成人、即過去之兒童、而今日之兒童、亦即將來之成人、新陳代謝、實括機輪、故西哲有言、一國家文明的進步、隨看兒童的脚跟』、又曰『兒童是地球的推轉者』、不寗西哲有此重視兒童之言論、即我國古昔聖賢亦有之、孔子曰、『後生可畏』、孟子曰『幼吾幼以及人之幼』、凡此種種、皆可以闡明兒童爲民族之生命、文明之生機、國家之元氣、社會之質點、關係根本、不容稍有玩視也、然則由是言之、吾人對於今日之兒童節、又烏可以一時之國難、而視爲緩　耶、</p>
<p>夫養成健全之分子、積而爲健全之社會培成健全之社會、積而爲健全之國家、因果相乘、理無成爽、是以近年來吾揭此義、策進本會、明告邦人、亦已屢矣、無如慈幼之事、正在進行、而外侮之來、又相接踵、本未固而先受摧殘、力未充而即遭襲擊、瞻念前途、實深悚懼、而　夫今之謀救國難者、不曰應如何改良政治、即曰應如何擴張軍力、獨對於國家生命所寄託之兒童、竟無人焉、爲之計其保養敎育、轉視兒童對於國家健全上、若相</p>
<p>關然者、此實未知十年生聚十年敎　之爲何事矣、蓋救濟目前之國難、固唯現在之成人是賴、若欲發揚國光、永絶外侮、使我五千年之中華民族、常能屹然獨立於世界、則非對於全國之現有兒童、儘量設法、竭力籌維、以保其生、而遂其養、以强其身、而迪其智、實不足以收安内攘外之永久效果也、</p>
<p>夫國家之强弱、莫不視乎其兒童敎養之良否而定、旣如上述矣、則吾人當此國難期間、舉行兒童節、其意義之重大、當迥異乎尋常之一般紀念節、又無待言矣、用敢趁此時期、更揭其意義如次、須知兒童爲國家之兒童、非一人之私有、故其敎之養之、國家應負其責、曠觀歐美各國、對於兒童保育、莫不設有種種機關、以盡其敎養兒童之職責、可以知矣、此一義也、兒童敎養、必須有平等之機遇、無論其爲貧爲富、以及有父兄與否、旣應使之各得其所、無衣食之堪虞、又應使之各有所學、謀天能之發展、端其始以謀其終、俾之成爲健全分子、以安社會、而强國家、此又一義也、所冀海内賢達、宣傳此義、勸導社會、督促政府、以謀慈幼事業之發展、而建百年樹人之大計、倘能自茲以往、國難幸除、敵國外患、永不復見、則吾人今日所舉行紀念之兒童節、庶爲不虚矣、</p>
<h3>今年本市小學敎師紀念兒童節應有之認識</h3>
<p>上海市敎育局長徐佩璜</p>
<p>兒童、是怎樣甜蜜可愛的一個名詞、兒童是怎樣有希望的未來世界的主人翁、我們任何時候都愛兒童、我們爲了未來世界的幸福計、更覺得兒童的寳貴可愛、這兒童節的舉行、委寳是尊重兒童地位的一種新制度、自從民國二十年敎育　　定四月四日兒童節紀念辦法通令各省市敎育行政機關遵辦之後、今年當然是第一次舉行兒童節的紀念、在那期間正當强敵入宼淞滬、本市兒童爲了抗敵作戰而犧牲讀書的同多、並且爲之而喪失性命的、亦復不少、我們在這强敵無理摧殘本市兒童的環境中、要舉行偉大的莊嚴的尊重兒童地位的儀式、不由的覺得小學敎師工作的重要和責任的偉大、因有下列三點、敬獻於我本市小學敎師之前、第一、我們做小學敎師的紀念兒童節、應該脚踏實地把整個的生命付之於兒童敎育事業之研究改進、我們題爲兒童謀利益而犧牲一已的希望、我們不願爲自己的利益而犧牲多數兒童的幸福、</p>
<p>第二、我們今後的兒童敎育應該爲團體爲國家着想、養成活潑健康肯爲公衆服務的美滿兒童、從今以後、不再有自私自利的兒童產生、</p>
<p>第三、體格的健全、和科學的研究、是我國兒童最需要的兩大敎育目標、從今以後、我們小學校的健康敎育、和科學校育、應該更有一種積極的實際準備、</p>
<p>總之、紀念兒童節、在兒童方面爲鼓舞兒童興趣和啓發兒童愛羣愛國之心理、在敎師方面、實爲整飭精神、努力於兒童敎育事業之唯一原動力、國難未己、民族存亡關鍵、全靠我們親愛的小學敎師的下層工作、我們應該堅决地相信國家的興亡、小學敎師實握有偉大的勢力、從今以後、國家未來的主人翁、經了我們小學敎師的栽植培養、今日破離的河山、不難由我們今後的努力以恢復之、那末兒童節的舉行、彷彿是爲了我們小學敎師舉行敎育救國一種宣誓禮了、我於兒童節、　節、以　　　南北相同、又　往　之『三三』、『五五』、『七七』、『九九』及今時之『十十』各節、互相　映、而不衝突、屬會戰司慈　、用敢　　　　（下略）云云、</p>

<p>中華慈幼協會遵於是日預備材料、擬就辦法大網、派員出席社會局聯席會議、結果謂此事關係全國、旣經呈請市政府轉呈國府核示、應　國府明令再行舉辦云云、</p>
<p>該會復於四月二日、奉上海市社會局第八四四七號調令、内開、</p>
<p>爲令知事、查該會呈請轉呈規定兒童節一案、前經據情呈請市會呈國民政府核示、業己令飭知　在案、兹舉市府第七七七九號訓令内開、以准國民政府文官處函開、奉主席發下貴市府呈據社會局轉呈、中華慈幼協會請予規定四月四</p>

<p>奉蔣兼部長交下行政院訓令一件、以開於規定四月四日爲兒童節一案、奉中央交國民政府轉行敎育部擬定紀念辦法、頒行全國小學校幼稚園舉行、其辦法交由敎育部制定等因、自應遵辦、惟查此案原由貴會發起、足徵對於慈幼事業夙具熱心、慈奉前因、相應函請貴會貢獻意見見覆、以便參訂轉呈、至紉公誼、</p>
<p>該會於是將兒童節紀念辦法、擬具意見書、於五月二十一日呈敎育部社會敎育司、靜候採擇施行在案、嗣奉國府敎育部通令各省市府敎育廳内開、</p>

<p>所幸川粤帮時有零星交易</p>
<p>棉紗實需、在上週間形勢極其暗澹、以中日和平問題、尙未妥協、日兵未曾撤退、致人心異常恐惶、而金融緊急、銀根不能活動、交通困難、凡百商業蕭條、棉紗幸爲日常必需品物、故生意大量當然無望、但四川廣東内地零星交易、尙不斷絶、其他帮口舉動甚　、然查廣東·四川·汪西·等處、近日紗市大跌、而各地存貨均有、内地紗價廉過於滬、照此狀態論之、前途難有暢銷之望、幸上海各廠團積未厚、價格尙可維持、查全週各帮買去統計一各九百九十包、同行二百包、行情比前遇跌一二兩不等、申新廠開出二十支人鐘秒二百包、價爲一百七十七兩五錢、茲將各帮日買去之量額、分誌於後、</p>

<h3>上週棉花尙能站住</h3>
<p>可是缺乏大量的消費</p>
<p>棉花現銷近來尙稱不惡、但大量交易異常缺乏、因但界棉業狀况仍在悲觀中、俄棉在歐洲貨價甚廉、所以對於原棉採辦一層、目前無積極之必要、然滬埠存貨單薄、各廠略有購買添配之用而四路來源凋敝、故市價尙能平穩、申新廠在此週中進量最健、又進美棉二千件、美棉比前週跌一二十磅音、茲將各廠買進量額及高代價分誌於後、</p>

<h3>First Children's Day Message</h3>
<p>Today is the first Children's Day of the Republic of China. It is the most memorable day for the tens of thousands of lively and innocent children of China. It is also the day that the Chinese government, educational authorities, tens of thousands of fathers and brothers, and early childhood educators should pay the most attention to.</p>
<p>Some say that the 19th century was the century of women, and the 20th century is the century of children. This means that the 19th century was the era of women's liberation, and the 20th century is the era of children's liberation. Since the International Save the Children Fund held its first international conference in Brussels, Belgium, in August 1925, and established five principles for protecting children's rights, countries around the world have begun to pay attention to children's issues. This is the dawn of children's future, and also the dawn of human future. Looking at the facts before us, the oppression suffered by children is the most profound and the most neglected by us, and even considered reasonable. Fathers and brothers all regard children as their own private property, and at the same time, they believe that children are ignorant and unknowing, and they regard themselves as great wise men. Thus, they bind the pure will of children, destroy their vigorous vitality, and shackle their great lives, forcing children's will to conform to their own will. They despise the power of children and replace it with their own power, so that children have no freedom and no vitality. Like cattle and horses, they mechanically obey and are tamed under the whip of their masters. In the hands of such fathers and brothers and early childhood educators, how many great lives have been ruined, how many vibrant children have been ruined. This is a sin, a loss too great to estimate. Therefore, we should launch a great revolution for the tens of thousands of oppressed children.</p>
<p>As for the oppression and suffering suffered by children in our country, it is even more profound than in any other country. Due to the darkness of politics and the poverty of the livelihoods of most people, tens of thousands of children are struggling for their lives under starvation with their fathers and brothers. The drought in Shaanxi and Gansu the year before last, where people exchanged their children to eat, almost became commonplace. The infant mortality rate is 540 per thousand, second only to India. As for children's education, it is even out of the question. Of the 43 million school-age children nationwide, only 6.5 million have the right to receive education. More than 80% are deprived of the right to education. Parents not only regard children as their private property, but also believe that raising children is entirely for the purpose of supporting the elderly and passing on the family line. "Raising children to prevent old age" and "storing grain to prevent famine" are the traditional philosophies adhered to by most people. Therefore, Chinese children, especially today, should immediately launch a great revolution.</p>
<p>We believe that children have their own great lives. Children's lively, natural, and pure lives are absolutely incomprehensible to adults, and should never be shackled by adults. Moreover, children are the masters of the future society. The future of children is the future of society, the future of mankind. We should promote the vitality of children and make them creators of the new era, and never allow them to be shackled and become successors of the old era. In the hands of fathers, brothers, and early childhood educators lies the future of society and mankind. Therefore, re-evaluating, re-recognizing, and grasping the value and life of the seedlings in one's hands is the most urgent task at present. We believe that there should be equal opportunities for survival, and equal opportunities for education. The government's sitting idly by while millions of children are out of school is the government's incompetence. Sitting idly by while millions of children struggle for their small lives under starvation is tantamount to killing children. Therefore, today, we earnestly hope that the government will not only promulgate Children's Day, but also further seek to improve children's health and various educational happiness, and promote children's vitality to cultivate healthy masters of the future era.</p>
<p>Today, we should bless the tens of thousands of children, and bless the future Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Conference to Continue Today</h3>
<p>Li Jishen Advocates for Japanese Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Various Groups Oppose Compromise with Japan</p>
<p>Japanese Side Convenes Important Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The plenary session and the subcommittee meetings of the ceasefire conference are scheduled to continue at the British Consulate this afternoon at 3:00 PM. The agenda is to discuss the locations and timing of the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Japanese military authorities, Lieutenant General Ueda, Chief of Staff Tashiro, and Naval Chief of Staff Shimada, held a meeting at the Japanese Consulate yesterday afternoon. Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu also attended. The public believes that the content of the various issues of the ceasefire conference is quite secret.</p>
<h3>Li Jishen Discusses Troop Withdrawal Deadline</h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Nanjing on the 3rd reported that Li Jishen, who also serves as the director of the First Hall of the Military Affairs Commission, stated that Japan's failure to determine a deadline for troop withdrawal clearly shows a lack of sincerity for peace. If they station troops at the locations they requested, they can restore their current positions within a few hours. Huang Qiangjun came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 2nd to report to the central government on the progress of the conference and Japan's attitude, which makes people deeply worried about the prospects for peace. The central government will allow at most two weeks for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, otherwise they will vow to resist to the death.</p>
<h3>List of Members of Joint Committee</h3>
<p>Foreign news reports that the members of the Joint Committee of the Shanghai Ceasefire Conference have been drafted and agreed upon by both China and Japan. The list is as follows: Guo Taiqi, Huang Qiang, and Hua from China; Shigemitsu and Ueda from Japan; Lampson and Sandys from England; Johnson and Terrace Trestle from the United States; Wayreton and Penavete from France; and Ciano and Latini from Italy. The list will be announced as soon as the issue of the timing of the Japanese troop withdrawal is resolved.</p>
<h3>Expressions of the National Salvation Associations of Various Groups</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of National Salvation Associations of Various Groups held its seventh emergency representative conference yesterday afternoon. More than sixty representatives from various groups, including Hu Fengxiang, Shi Zhikun, Feng Shaoshan, Chu Fucheng, and Yin Zhiling, attended. Chu Fucheng was publicly elected as chairman. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, the discussion began on (1) Issuing a declaration urging Japan to withdraw its troops in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations, which was resolved and approved in principle, and the University Federation was appointed to draft it. (2) An advisory proposal to our chief representative Guo Taiqi was resolved and passed. (3) A proposal to prepare for the organization of a support committee for the Northeast Volunteer Army was resolved and the Road Association, the National Lawyers Association, the All-Zhejiang Association, the University Federation, the National Salvation Association, the National Relief Association, and other groups were appointed to prepare for it.</p>
<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of National Salvation Associations of Various Groups, on behalf of the three million people of Shanghai, tearfully appeals to the four hundred million compatriots of the country. This time, Japan's invasion of Shanghai with violent force is not only a local oppression of Shanghai, but an oppression of the entire Chinese nation. This association and the three million people of Shanghai, for the sake of the survival of the entire Chinese nation and for the sake of the interests of the entire Chinese nation, have unanimously resolved to vow to oppose the conditional withdrawal of troops. And with any diplomatic official, if he dares to defy the great disapproval of the world, to admit that Japan has conditionally withdrawn its troops, to admit that the Japanese army has indefinitely occupied the four important military areas of Wusong, Yinxiang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei, and to conditionally withdraw its troops, first, it violates the resolution of the League of Nations, and second, it violates the public opinion of the four hundred million compatriots of the country. This association and the three million people of Shanghai unanimously consider those who sign such an agreement that loses sovereignty and humiliates the country to be national traitors who sell out the sovereignty and territory of the Republic of China. We, the three million people of Shanghai, and our four hundred million compatriots across the country, should deal with them with the most effective and strictest methods. From the bottom of our hearts, this is the declaration.</p>
<h3>Letter to Guo Taiqi</h3>
<p>The Federation of National Salvation Associations of Various Groups sent a letter yesterday to our chief representative Guo Taiqi, stating that the Shanghai Sino-Japanese ceasefire and troop withdrawal negotiations, in accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly, can only agree on a certain procedure for Japan's troop withdrawal and must not have conditions that harm China's territorial integrity and administrative independence. Your representative has made solemn statements repeatedly and guaranteed it with his personal integrity. However, in the past few days of meetings, your representative has both admitted that the locations of our troops are restricted and admitted that Japanese soldiers can temporarily station in the four locations of Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, and Yinxiang, in an area of ​​fifty square miles. This is the fact that Japanese soldiers occupy the area and a legal acknowledgement. This violates the resolution of the League of Nations, obliterates public opinion, and loses sovereignty and humiliates the country. How can you face the soldiers who have fought hard to defend the country? How can you face the people who have sacrificed their lives and property to support the war of our national army? Upon hearing this news, this association is furious and hereby issues a warning. It is hoped that your representative will adhere to the initial position and not accept any conditions other than Japan's troop withdrawal. Otherwise, if you use sweet words to deceive the people and surrender to the enemy, the patriotic people will definitely not forgive your representative. The situation is urgent and it is difficult to choose words carefully. It is hoped that you will think carefully about how to handle this.</p>
<h3>Wen Zongyao and Others Issue a Public Telegram Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wen Zongyao and others telegraphed, "To the national public through all newspapers: At the Shanghai Ceasefire Conference, Japan not only demands to station troops in the four important areas of Wusong, Yinxiang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei, but also refuses to stipulate a withdrawal period. Recently, it has been heard that our government has completely conceded on the troop stationing locations and intends to discuss the withdrawal period in a round-table conference, with Japan only issuing a unilateral statement. If this is indeed the case, it is clearly a violation of the League of Nations resolution, combining political and military issues into one, and trapping the aforementioned four important areas in a hopeless situation of long-term occupation. Holding a conference under the pressure of enemy troops is akin to signing a treaty under duress. All our citizens should rise up and oppose it, supervise the government, and not hold a round-table conference until the situation before January 28 is restored. This telegram cannot express the urgency of the situation. Wen Zongyao, Sun Hongyi, Zhang Yaozeng, Tao Jiayao, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Yuanhao, Mu Xiangyue, Peng Yunyi, Qian Yongming, Xu Kecheng, Gu Xinyi, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Gangbo, Pan Xulun, Wang Zaoshi, Li Zukui, Zhang Zigui, Qian Zhixiang, Li Huang, Chu Fucheng, Cha Liangzhao, Di Baoxian, Zhao Shuyong, Nie Lusheng, Hu Yunlai, Feng Shaoshan, Yang Xixian, Hu Yungan, Kui Yanfang, Zhu Yinjiang, Yang Zhixiong, Hu Yunzhuang, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, You Jusun, and Tao Leqin, Hu Yunqiu."</p>
<h3>Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association Sends Telegram to the Government</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai telegraphed the National Government yesterday, stating, "Shanghai has fallen for a month now. The humiliation our people have suffered from foreign tribes in this month is not far from that of Korea and Taiwan. What should the government do to work hard to kill the enemy and rescue our people from fire and water? However, your office has always relied on international mediation and sought compromise with the Japanese side. Although you declare resistance every day, we have not seen you recover lost territories. What has been expressed in the ceasefire conference in recent days is even more suspicious. First, your office has repeatedly declared that there will be no troop withdrawal and no negotiations. Why is there now a negotiation on troop withdrawal? If they withdraw troops, they withdraw troops. What is there to negotiate? Negotiating about troop withdrawal, isn't it intentional to accept conditions that lose sovereignty and humiliate the country? Second, the so-called Japanese troop withdrawal should refer to withdrawing from Chinese territory. Why is it considered that they have withdrawn troops when the Japanese army retreats to the area of Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei, and the opening of a round-table conference is approved? May I ask, what is the difference between this and a treaty under duress? Third, the cases of the Eastern Provinces and Shanghai cannot be resolved separately, which your office has declared to the people. Why is it that for the Shanghai case, you are now approving the opening of a round-table conference separately? Isn't this intentionally following the Japanese side's trick to abandon the Eastern Provinces? Fourth, Chinese troops are stationed on Chinese territory. Who can restrict them? Why does your office even admit that our troops are temporarily stationed in their original locations, awaiting resolution by the round-table conference? Where is the so-called maintaining the integrity of the land and administration? Regarding the above four points, in your office's explanation, you must say that everything is temporary, that once the deadline for troop withdrawal arrives and the round-table conference opens, Shanghai will definitely return to its original state. But your office also remembers the first League of Nations resolution. Didn't it also set a deadline for the Japanese troop withdrawal? And today, have the Japanese troops in the Eastern Provinces withdrawn at all? We believe that in today's situation, international conventions have become waste paper, and world justice is even more empty talk. Apart from recovering lost territories by force, the Eastern Provinces are already gone, and Shanghai will also become the second Eastern Provinces. If your office does not plan for this, but can rely on diplomatic power to keep the territory intact, the colleagues of this association will really pluck out their eyes and hang them on the country's gate to wish you all success. But this will ultimately become an illusion. More than half a year has passed since the loss of the Eastern Provinces, and today is also the monthly anniversary of the loss of Shanghai. What is the effect of your office's trust in the League of Nations? In the aftermath of our misery, we deeply feel that today's matter is either surrender or war. We earnestly hope that your office will not forget the meaning of the National Revolution and the spirit of nationalism, and will quickly raise a righteous army to drive the Japanese troops out of the country.</p>
<p>To recover our lost territories in Shanghai and the Eastern Provinces and to gain the independence and freedom of our Chinese nation. If unfortunately, you use long-term resistance as a name and long-term procrastination as a reality, or even sacrifice national interests and personal integrity in order to maintain personal status and strength, then whether the general public will still obey the National Government is something we are afraid to say. Honest words are offensive to the ear. Please do not disregard them as being contrary to what you want to hear. The Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association bows in respect, Jiang Yin."</p>
<h3>There is More Contact at the Front</h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Kunshan on the 3rd stated that on the night of the 2nd, the enemy disturbed our Cao'an Temple in five directions, but our defending troops learned of it and immediately divided their troops to surround the enemy. As a result, the enemy was killed or wounded by more than 20 people, and the rest retreated to Xizhu Village. A special dispatch from Suzhou on the 3rd stated that the villages near the pailou market were severely disturbed after being occupied by the enemy. The peasants were forced to be greatly angry. At noon on the 2nd, they gathered two to three hundred people and fought against the Japanese soldiers with farm tools. As a result, several people were killed and the peasants retreated into our army's position. When the enemy chased to our troops, they were repelled by our army. In the afternoon, the villages of Huangdu and the eastern suburbs of Taicang were looted by the enemy. There were more than 1,000 enemies in Jiading and the enemy headquarters in Liuhe. There were 2,000 enemies.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai for Medical Treatment Due to Poor Health</p>
<p>Visited Sun Ke in the Morning and Received Guo and Wu in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Beijing yesterday morning at 10:30 a.m. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, and others went to welcome him. After arriving in Shanghai, Wang returned to his private residence to rest. Then, at 11:10 a.m., he went to visit Sun Ke at No. 10 Molier Road in the French Concession and talked for a long time. He left at about 12:00 p.m. At about 3:00 p.m., he went to the Sincere Company and Wing On Company with his daughter in car No. 79299 to buy clothing materials. He returned to his residence at about 4:00 p.m. Then, Guo Taiqi, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai, went to visit him one after another at 4:20 p.m. Mayor Wu reported on the recent security situation in the city. Vice Minister Guo reported on the situation of the ceasefire conference. Mayor Wu left first at 5:55 p.m., and Vice Minister Guo reported on the situation of the ceasefire conference until 6:10 p.m. According to Mr. Guo's remarks to the New Sound News Agency, President Wang came to Shanghai for medical treatment recently due to poor health and did not have any important mission. The rumor that he came to Shanghai for the National Crisis Conference to urge Sun Zhesheng to attend the meeting in Luoyang is not true. (I, Guo, claim that) when I paid a visit, I reported the details of the ceasefire conference in detail in person. Wang did not make any expression on the progress of the conference. As for President Wang's views on the progress of the ceasefire conference, he has repeatedly expressed his views in training telegrams, so he did not make any other expressions yesterday. It is expected that he will return to Beijing in a day or two.</p>
<p>President Wang made a speech to reporters yesterday, saying, (Question) What is the purpose of your coming here? (Answer) Since the close of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, I have long wanted to come to Shanghai to meet with Mr. Sun Zhesheng and others. It was delayed because of the League of Nations investigation team. I was only able to come this morning. (Question) What was the content of the League of Nations investigation team's several talks in Beijing? (Answer) The League of Nations investigation team inquired about the Sino-Japanese incident. I and others answered them one by one based on the facts and the legitimate wishes of the people. (Question) What are the nature and powers of the National Crisis Conference? (Answer) The nature and powers of the National Crisis Conference were stipulated by the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, with the scope of discussing resistance to insults, disaster relief, and pacification. After I took over as President of the Executive Yuan, I could only handle everything according to the resolution. (Question) Then, when will democratic politics be implemented? (Answer) The First Plenary Session of the Central Committee resolved that half of the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan should be elected by the people. The recent political conference has resolved that the election will be completed before August 1. This can be the beginning of democratic politics. (Question) When will the party rule end? (Answer) The Kuomintang is different from the Communist Party of Soviet Russia and the Fascist Party of Italy. It is not a permanent dictatorship of one party, but it wants to introduce constitutionalism through tutelage. As long as the time and conditions are met, constitutionalism can begin. I am very willing to work hard to promote it. (Question) Some people say that after you came to power, you gave up the advocacy of democratic politics. Is that true? (Answer) Please review my speeches and writings over the years. I advocate "restoring democratic centralization at the time and cultivating democratic politics in the country." I am certainly not in favor of dictatorship, but I do not want to return to the nominal constitutionalism before the twelfth year of the Republic of China. This view has not changed to this day, and I am working hard to achieve it.</p>
<p>Last Autumn</p>
<h3>Six Dikes Breached at Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee Hires Workers to Repair</p>
<p>All Expected to be Completed in April</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee is currently repairing the six dikes that were breached near Gaoyou last autumn. Previously, an anonymous Chinese person generously donated 200,000 yuan for the repair of the dikes. The committee then engaged in surveying, dike repair projects near Gaoyou, and with the assistance of the Dredging Bureau, created an engineering plan. The estimated cost is approximately 400,000 yuan. They then negotiated with the Jiangsu Provincial Government for consent and were approved by the National Government Relief Flood Committee to allocate 20 million tons of disaster relief wheat, and began construction. Of the six breaches to be repaired, the largest project is the Dangjunlou, which is 166 zhang long and the mouth of the breach is more than 2 zhang deep. The built dike base is approximately 14 zhang and 8 chi wide. The next is the Miaohang mouth, which is 34 zhang long and the dike base is 11 zhang and 9 chi wide. The 20-li shop is 64 zhang long and the dike base is 13 zhang and 3 chi wide. The 30-li shop is 67 zhang and 5 chi long. There are also two locations, one is Jigon dike and the other is Yumatou. The breaches are smaller, but they are also quite important. Currently, the daily employment of workers ranges from 10,000 to 12,000 people. It is planned to build all dikes to a height of 2 zhang and a width of 3 zhang. It is estimated that all will be completed in April.</p>

<h3>The National Chamber of Commerce Holds a Meeting</h3>
<p>After receiving the letter, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce decided to hold a standing committee meeting at 4:00 p.m. today to discuss the nomination of representatives so that a reply can be sent.</p>
<p>National Postal Workers Union</p>
<h3>Disapproves of Postage Stamp Price Increase</h3>
<p>Will Submit a Proposal to the Ministry to Merge with the Savings and Remittance Bureau</p>
<p>And Advocate that Postal Revenue Should be Used Exclusively for Postal Services</p>
<p>The National Postal Workers Union held its 28th regular meeting at its office yesterday afternoon. Committee members Lu Jingshi, Zhu Xuefan, Wang Shufan, Wang Yisheng, Zhao Shusheng, Zhang Kechang, and Zhu Yinghua, and Secretary-General Xiao Qingshan attended. They reported on the work since February and the process of rescue, consolation, and donation, and resolved more than a dozen important cases. In addition to having detailed regulations on the general outline of work during the national crisis, it is understood that there are also cautious and appropriate expressions regarding the issue of postage stamp price increases, which are roughly as follows: In recent years, due to domestic floods and foreign troubles, the postal service has suffered huge losses. Therefore, the postal economy has been greatly affected, especially after the separation of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, which squanders postal public funds. Moreover, the government's aviation business has repeatedly extracted postal revenue as a source of funding, further causing the postal economy to plummet. However, the transportation authorities do not seek fundamental improvements in administration to thoroughly reduce costs, but only dig a well when they are thirsty. When there is no other choice, they implement postage stamp price increases, increasing the burden on the people. This association expresses its deep regret. It is heard that the association also notified the postal workers' unions in various places under its jurisdiction to follow the above-mentioned intentions, work hard to publicize them, and order them to separately submit requests to the Ministry, suggesting that the Savings and Remittance Bureau be merged and requesting that postal revenue be used exclusively for postal services, and that all subsidies to the airline companies be stopped. It is also heard that committee members Lu Jingshi and Zhao Shusheng and others plan to take advantage of the opportunity to participate in the National Crisis Conference to inspect the postal workers' unions along the way.</p>

<p>The Jiangwan War Victims' Association's</p>
<h3>Report and Plan</h3>
<p>Total losses estimated at over ten million yuan, rehabilitation plan requires 800,000 yuan, emergency relief fund over 280,000 yuan</p>
<p>The Jiangwan District War Victims' United Association prepared a report and plan yesterday, excerpts of which are as follows: "As our association is organized by war victims, it concerns our vital interests. Therefore, since its establishment, we have been striving to carry out our work. The progress made includes investigation, registration, and burial. After several meetings, honorary directors were appointed to provide assistance. Regarding investigation and registration, there are 2,716 war-stricken households registered, with direct and indirect losses totaling 21,326,000 yuan. However, due to time constraints and the scattered residence of villagers, the investigation and registration only cover less than a quarter of the area. Therefore, the total losses in the district are estimated to be worth over 80 million yuan. Regarding burial work, except for the bodies burned by Japanese soldiers in the war zone before it was opened, our association, under the name of the Chongshan Hall, has been collecting and burying bodies. As of now, 946 bodies have been buried, and many incomplete bodies remain hidden in secluded places and under the ruins of houses. After this catastrophe, our Jiangwan villagers are not in a position to mourn the dead, but must urgently seek to survive. Therefore, we must have a rehabilitation plan for Jiangwan, where we have lived and will continue to live, and hope to realize it. However, after this major destruction, the high prices of timber, materials, and all goods are inevitable. Even with a simple estimation based on the original houses and goods, we need 800,000 yuan to proceed. Therefore, without external assistance, there is no hope for rehabilitation. (The reasons and facts can be found in our association's declaration.) Our only hope is to implement the original policy of the municipal government and obtain compensation from the Japanese side. Otherwise, we hope to follow the precedent of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and allocate cash and issue public bonds for relief and compensation. We also hope that benevolent capitalists will organize a city development company to invest in renting land and building houses on a semi-charitable basis, and that landlords will have the priority to rent the houses, so that fellow villagers will not be homeless. However, the rehabilitation plan is a major matter and cannot be realized in a short period. Fish in a dried-up rut can hardly wait for the water of the West River. Therefore, immediate relief is urgently needed. According to statistics, there are over 8,000 disaster-stricken households. Assuming an average of six people per household, there are 50,000 victims. Except for half who can barely support themselves, providing one month's worth of food at five yuan per person requires over 120,000 yuan. However, simply providing food is not a long-term solution. Cultivating the land requires capital. Jiangwan has 40,000 mu of arable land. Even if we only consider the cost of seeds, at an average of half a yuan per mu, we need 20,000 yuan. Building a straw shed in each village costs an average of 120 yuan, and there are 34 destroyed villages, requiring over 80,000 yuan. Now that the atmosphere of peace is gradually becoming stronger, if we do not plan for immediate relief for the survivors of this catastrophe, there will be nothing left. Therefore, we must rely on the assistance of charitable individuals and those responsible for maintaining order."</p>

<p>War Damage Registration Office</p>
<h3>Notice to All Affected Households</h3>
<p>The destruction and casualties caused by the Japanese troops' invasion are evident everywhere. Our losses are enormous and difficult to calculate. To obtain accurate statistics, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Accountants' Association have jointly established a special investigation office to conduct initial and detailed registrations. Although the number of people registering daily is overwhelming, there may still be victims who are unaware of this, or who are aware but still hesitant to come forward, or who have taken refuge in other cities and are unaware that they can request forms by mail and register by mail, or who, after their losses, are unwilling to register. If they do nothing, there will be no hope of compensation in the future. To protect the interests of the victims, the office hereby reiterates to all affected parties to request forms by mail or in person from the Accountants' Association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road, Public Concession, fill them out in detail, and register them for compilation and statistics, which will serve as the basis for negotiating compensation. There will be absolutely no fees charged. There is no doubt about the fairness and justice of the law. As your rights are involved, please do not ignore this.</p>

It is hoped that many benevolent individuals in Shanghai will attend the concert on that day. It is both a feast for the senses and a manifestation of doing good, truly achieving two goals at once.</p>

<h3>Closing of the Siming Public Association Shelter, Republic of China</h3>
<p>The shelter jointly established by the Ningbo Fellow Association and the Siming Public Association on Minquan Road has housed more than 16,700 refugees. Fortunately, the place is spacious, and the order of sleeping and eating is relatively orderly. However, due to the large population, diseases inevitably occur. Fortunately, the fellow villager, Dr. Wang Boyuan, enthusiastically provides free medical treatment, working tirelessly and often residing in the shelter. He has experience in reviving patients with strange diseases, truly bringing the dead back to life. Recently, it has been learned that the shelter has a plan for dissolution, allowing those who wish to return to their hometown or stay in Shanghai to do so according to their own convenience. Each person is given two types of assistance: 5 yuan for men, 6 yuan for women, and half for children. Those who leave Shanghai are also given boat tickets. All are treated fairly, and the refugees are very grateful and dispersing. The shelter will be closed soon, demonstrating the generosity and efficiency of the shelter's organizers, which is admirable. It is heard that Dr. Wang Boyuan has established Boyuan Hospital at No. 4, A, Tongzhou Road, at the intersection of Heng Road in Hongkou East. If anyone is suffering from a chronic illness, please try visiting the hospital, which will surely bring about recovery.</p>

The county magistrate is ordered to strictly investigate and prohibit this, and to report the current stock of rice in the county for verification. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Yan has ordered all districts to comply.</p>

(3) The letter from Fu Linqing and other representatives of residents of Hongyuan Lane, stating that the landlord Hengyi Real Estate Company was forcing them to pay rent and threatening to auction off the tenants' belongings, requesting assistance. It was resolved to hand it over to the investigation department for investigation. If the allegations are true, in addition to warning the landlord, the matter will be handed over to the legal team for handling according to law. (4) The investigation department proposed that the "My Views on Rent Reduction" advertisements were nonsensical and appeared to have other motives and intentions, and how to respond. It was resolved to refute the advertisements and hand them over to the investigation department for strict investigation of the real names and to deal with them according to law. (5) The standing committee proposed that the association should send a letter to the Lawyers' Association, requesting them to inform their members not to represent landlords in cases of disputes arising from alleged rent arrears before the rent reduction measures are decided. It was resolved to pass the motion and to hold the fifth executive committee meeting at 6:00 PM today to discuss all ongoing matters.</p>
<p>The Shanghai West Citizens' Rent Reduction Association submitted a document to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"Regarding the request for landlords to reduce rent due to the hardship of the war and the difficulties of livelihood, in order to benefit the people and show compassion, since the outbreak of the war, our Songhu, Jiatai, and other places have been frequently devastated by artillery fire, and houses have been reduced to ruins. The Shanghai West area is adjacent to the war zone, and Japanese planes come several times a day to bomb. In addition, with the establishment of Japanese factories, the Japanese army uses the excuse of protection to cause disturbances from time to time. Citizens flee in panic to save their lives, businesses are closed, and there are no pedestrians on the road, which is almost the same as the war zone. The losses are enormous, and the suffering is immense, the severity of which is unprecedented. Moreover, most of the residents in Shanghai West rely on factories for a living. In the past, when things were peaceful, the high rent was already too much to bear. Now, with the need to evacuate and relocate, livelihoods are cut off, and food is scarce. They have no ability to pay the rent. As a result, disputes over rent collection arise in streets and alleys, causing constant disturbances. If this continues, it will seriously affect social security. The citizens are deeply concerned about this situation, and after repeated discussions with representatives from various neighborhoods in Shanghai West, it has been agreed that the central government has moved its capital to Luoyang, and the Beijing municipal authorities have also issued clear orders to reduce rent and taxes to relieve the people's suffering. Now, the war in this city has had a greater impact, and the people's suffering is greater than that in Beijing. Therefore, rent reduction is urgently needed. We hereby submit this document to the government, hoping that you will understand the people's suffering and order all property owners to uniformly reduce rent by 30% before the end of the war. Other organizations, schools, and private residences that house refugees should be granted a full exemption, in order to avoid disputes arising from rent collection and to prevent the poor from taking risks. This concerns social welfare and people's livelihood, and we beg that you immediately approve it in order to relieve the people's suffering and show compassion. This would be of great benefit. The French Concession."</p>

<h3>The Iron-Blood Ambulance Team Solicits Medicine</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Blood Battlefield Ambulance Team sent personnel to Shanghai yesterday with a letter to solicit medicine from the New Drug Association and other groups. The letter stated: "Since the Japanese bandits have been tyrannical, the whole country is indignant. Fortunately, our country's officers and soldiers are loyal and brave in defending the country, seeking survival for the nation, and winning glory for the nation. Although the Japanese bandits relied on sharp weapons, our army held the spirit of certain death and was able to resist for more than a month, eventually making the enemy lose their courage. The members of our team, mindful that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country, but without weapons, cannot participate in killing the enemy. They are willing to swear to be as firm as iron and as hot as blood, hold a spirit of sacrifice, and organize this team. It has been filed with the local party and government agencies and designated by the 19th Route Army Headquarters to assist in the work. On the third day of departure to the front line, it coincided with the general retreat. Immediately, we cooperated with various associations to rescue refugees from danger. At this moment, our team is temporarily stationed in Kunshan, quietly awaiting orders. Although it is a period of truce, we will definitely rely on the overall situation and will never stop halfway. In the future, there will be a greater lack of medical supplies for supplies and rear hospitals. In order to avoid digging a well when thirsty, we have to request relief. With the通行證 issued by the General Headquarters, personnel were sent to the front to request that your association give its full support and actively donate medical supplies."</p>

<h3>The Rumor That the Ye Garden in Meiwang Was Destroyed Is Not True</h3>

<h3>Shen-Su Two Small Steamers Were Robbed</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway was blocked, the transportation on the Shanghai-Suzhou route has been entirely dependent on small steamers. However, robberies of steamers by bandits have occurred repeatedly, all committed by Taihu bandits. In the past two days, two more Suzhou steamers have encountered robbers on the way. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Yong Sheng</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the tense situation in Suzhou, many residents have moved to Shanghai. Shanghai's inland river steamer companies, which did not operate the Shanghai-Suzhou line in the past, have also opened temporary services, and there is no space for passengers. The Yong Sheng, a Shanghai-Suzhou steamer of the China Merchants Bureau, was carrying three company ships and cargo ships from Suzhou this time. The passengers were crowded, and there were many cages and boxes. The captain, Li Arong, departed from Suzhou on the 2nd. At 10:30 PM that night, the ship arrived at Yuwan, about 140 miles from Shanghai, where there are the most bandits. At the end of January this year, a steamer of the Bureau was robbed here. Unexpectedly, the Yong Sheng arrived near Yuwan Town, and four bandit ships were waiting. As the Yong Sheng approached, the bandits fired their guns from the ships and shouted for the steamer to stop. The captain of the Yong Sheng, knowing it was difficult to resist, had to stop. There were more than 30 bandits on the four ships, each holding guns and knives. They boarded the steamer and the company ships to rob, first opening the boxes and luggage to search, then searching the passengers, and finally searching the ship's office for money, jewelry, and valuable clothes. After an hour, the total loss from the robbery was about 3,300 to 3,400 yuan. They only returned to Shanghai yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Heng Ren</h3>
<p>The Heng Ren, a Suzhou steamer of the Tongyuan (i.e., Dai Shengchang) Company, also departed from Suzhou after the China Merchants steamer returned. The steamer was towing five ships, three of which were hired by passengers to bring goods to Shanghai. When the Yong Sheng encountered the bandits, the Heng Ren had not yet known, because they were about a mile apart. When the Heng Ren arrived at Yuwan, the Yong Sheng had just finished being robbed. The captain of the Heng Ren, Zhang Hufu, saw the bandit ships and wanted to escape, but it was too late. The bandits fired their guns as a warning, and the Heng Ren stopped immediately. The bandits then jumped onto the steamer and the five ships to search, thoroughly. It took two hours to complete. The loss from the robbery was greater than that of the Yong Sheng, totaling about 4,000 yuan for the passengers and others. However, the passengers were unharmed. The Yong Sheng and Heng Ren only started sailing after the bandits had escaped. They also suffered engine damage on the way, and only arrived in Shanghai at 9:40 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Fudan Football Causes Trouble</h3>
<p>Xu Zhicheng Was Severely Beaten</p>
<p>The Prosecutor Examined and Waited for Questioning</p>
<p>Xu Zhicheng, a graduate of Fudan University, was carried to the Shanghai Local Court by his family yesterday to examine his injuries. The complaint stated that in the spring of this year, former classmates organized a football team in their spare time to compete at the Fudan football field. At 3:00 PM on the 1st of this month, the team competed again. I was a referee and notary for one side, and the other side was Chen Zhanggen and Xia Shiliang (i.e., Da Ying A Bao). As the game was coming to an end, Chen's side lost two goals. Unexpectedly, the other side became angry and said that I was unfair. Da Ying A Bao immediately pointed a gun at us as if to shoot, making us afraid to move. Chen Zhanggen then stabbed me with a sharp knife, causing my left eyeball to be poked out. At the same time, the other side shouted to commit the crime. Eleven people from their side each held a stick and beat us. Our side, intimidated by the power of the pistol, caused our player Tu Huijun to also be severely injured. I was sent to the Red Cross Hospital by the Sixth District Second Office. My eyelid was sewn up. The injury is very serious and there is a risk to life. I request an investigation. The judge, Zhao, opened the court for questioning, and then ordered the inspectors to verify that Xu Zhicheng was indeed injured, fearing that he would become disabled. The questioner said that football is a noble sport, but now it has turned into a barbaric tragedy. He ordered that the defendants be brought to justice.</p>

<h3>Newspaper Vendor Crushed to Death by a Car</h3>
<p>Zhang Are, a resident of No. 1 Deshan Lane, Avenue Edouard VII, 37 years old this year, made a living selling newspapers. At 8:00 PM on the 1st of this month, while selling newspapers at the intersection of Xinxiao Street and Avenue Edouard VII, a driver surnamed Jia from the Tianshengtang Street Perilli Car Company drove a car. For some reason, the car went off course, causing Zhang to be unable to avoid it and was knocked down and injured in the head. The patrolman found it, copied the number, and brought the driver and the car to the police station to report to the head of the police. On one side, the injured was sent to the Renji Hospital, but he died in the hospital that night due to serious injuries. The hospital notified the police station and brought the body to the autopsy room of the Auxiliary Element Branch Hall. The next morning, Chen Beisan, the chief prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, and the forensic doctor arrived at the scene to verify that the deceased had indeed died from being hit by a car before his death. After the verification, the head of the car department reported the situation of the accident and questioned the defendant. Because there was no body in the case, it was ordered that the body be handed over to the Auxiliary Element Hall for photography and collection. The defendant was sent to the hospital by the police station for questioning. The younger brother of the deceased, Zhang Awu, learned of the incident and rushed to the autopsy room to identify the body, and then went to the car department to request to claim the body for collection. It is heard that the police station will send this case to the court for questioning today after investigation.</p>
<h3>Treatment for Meningitis</h3>
<p>Zheng Wenrong submitted a letter stating, "I have checked that the disease 'meningitis' is a kind of 'spasm' disease in traditional Chinese medicine. At the beginning, there is headache, chest tightness, stiff neck, followed by opisthotonos and coma. It is indeed a dangerous disease, but it is not incurable. Now, I have a friend who is well-versed in treating this disease and has repeatedly achieved miraculous effects. I have also given this medicine to a German doctor in Tianjin, who praised it very much after the verification. I am willing to make the treatment method public to benefit the sick. The method is to use 'ferrous sulfate' calcined to retain its properties (this alum will turn red when calcined) and grind it into a fine powder. If the patient has a headache on the left side, blow a little alum powder into the right nostril. If the headache is on the right side, blow it into the left nostril. If the headache is on both sides of the head, blow it into both nostrils. After two or three minutes, the chest will feel refreshed. This is effective. After a while, clear nasal mucus will flow, followed by blood. That is when the condition is cured. According to the nature of ferrous sulfate, it is sour, cool, and non-toxic, and has the same effect as alum. It is a product that dissolves phlegm and detoxifies, and is most effective in treating blood stasis. I especially record it for the research of medical experts."</p>
<h3>Contribution of Natalac Milk Powder</h3>
<p>Natalac milk powder, which is no different from human milk, is manufactured in the famous country of Holland. It has been known throughout Europe and its sales are very large. Because it is made from disinfected and sterile fresh milk juice, dried by the latest invention of low-heat drying method, and supplemented and cut according to the composition of human milk, all the enzymes and vitamins in it are not damaged at all. Doctors everywhere who have heard of its composition have introduced and praised it as a new contribution to milk powder. Now, the German company Huikang Foreign Firm at No. 29 Sichuan Road in this city is the agent in China. The New World Company and Taikang Food Company on Nanjing Road, major companies, Yonglong, Xinchang, and Jinwen in the French Concession, etc., and all major and small pharmacies are selling it. The firm also employs female nurses to specialize in guiding infant hygiene. If people from all walks of life want to try Natalac milk powder, they can write to the firm, and they will immediately send a female nurse to come, without any charge.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Respected Sir, I have just read the news published in your newspaper on the 2nd of this month about Zhang Lianquan, the special envoy for the development of the Northwest, arriving in Shanghai. In it, regarding the customs, it said that cloth in the Northwest is very precious. In the Pingliang Road area at the junction of Shaanxi and Gansu, unmarried women do not wear pants because cloth is scarce. It is only when they get married that they use the cloth sent by the man's family to make pants. This custom has been passed down to this day. After investigation, my country's cultural development has been from the northwest to the southeast. Therefore, Gansu Province is the hometown of Xuanyuan and the source of culture. However, in recent years, due to the separation of mountains and rivers and inconvenient transportation, it is not easy to contact the material culture of the West, resulting in extravagance and luxury that is far less than that of the southeastern provinces, and there are absolutely no different points in etiquette and customs. Zhang Lianquan's remarks are extremely regrettable. Our Association bears the important responsibility of developing Northwest culture and has a very detailed investigation of the customs of the people of Gansu. Such bizarre stories are absolutely non-existent. I am writing this letter to request a correction. Best regards, The Northwest Society Investigation Department of the Shen Bao, April 3, 21st year.</p>
<p>Respected Sir, In today's newspaper, it was reported that I negotiated the release of eight detained refugees in two days, and that Consul Chizaki was in charge of detaining Chinese people. After investigation, Chizaki was the one who made contact, not the one in charge of the matter. This does not conform to the facts, and I fear it will cause misunderstanding. I am writing this letter to correct it, and I hope you will publish it in the letter column. Respectfully, Liu Jingwu, April 3.</p>

(3) It is hoped that all the elected members this time will be non-party members, so that the public's opinions can be communicated with the government as much as possible. It is also learned that the drafting committee intends to suggest to the central government to expand the number of elected members to account for two-thirds of the legislative supervisory committee, in order to broadly absorb public opinion.

<h3>Japan's Financial Situation Extremely Difficult</h3>
<p>Unable to Raise Funds for the Invasion of China</p>
<p>Various Policies Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>South Manchurian Railway Foreign Debt Due Soon</p>
<p>Only Option is to Borrow to Repay Debt</p>
<p>Jiji, Tokyo, 3rd Telegram The government is scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting on the 7th to decide on the supplementary budget for Showa 7 in order to submit it to the second provisional Diet. However, Japan's financial situation is extremely difficult, and there is no way to raise funds for the Shanghai and Manchurian cases. Therefore, the various policies advocated by the Seiyukai cannot be implemented. The Seiyukai is currently negotiating with Finance Minister Takahashi about the budget for the party's five-year industrial plan in order to implement it. However, the Finance Minister has rejected all requests. Some members of the Seiyukai are dissatisfied with the Finance Minister's attitude and even advocate replacing the Finance Minister. Although this kind of advocacy has no possibility of being realized, it will definitely have a bad impact on the future of the government. Jiji, Tokyo, 3rd Telegram The South Manchurian Railway's foreign debt of 60 million yuan will be due on July 23.

<h3>To Attend the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 2nd Telegram Secretary of State Stimson is scheduled to leave for Geneva on Friday in order to temporarily serve as the U.S. chief representative to the Disarmament Conference. Stimson will stay in Geneva for a few days to investigate various matters and then return to the United States. U.S. representative Gibson will serve as chief representative after Stimson leaves Geneva. According to responsible sources, Stimson's trip to Geneva has no other purpose than for the work of the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 3rd Telegram Stimson, at the strong request of former Undersecretary of State Davis, immediately decided to personally go to Geneva. Davis is the U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, has an optimistic view of the future results of the conference, and expects rapid progress to be made. Davis told Stimson that when the Disarmament Conference reconvenes in the future, Stimson's personal speech will be more powerful than other members of the delegation. Stimson plans to meet with dignitaries from major countries. Ostensibly, Stimson is solely focused on the Disarmament Conference, but in fact, Stimson is determined to take this opportunity to discuss international issues that are vital to the survival of the United States. Stimson is certainly prepared for people to ask about the U.S.'s attitude towards war debts and reparations issues, but the U.S. government is extremely hopeful that such sensitive issues will not be mentioned in order to avoid hindering the Republican Party's election campaign.</p>

The route will pass through Urumqi in Xinjiang Province, with 2,500 miles of the route passing through Chinese territory.

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from all the disaster victims in Fufeng and Wugong, Shaanxi The whole country is suffering from rare droughts and floods, but Shaanxi has been the most severely affected for four years. Among the disasters in Shaanxi, the western region is the most severely affected. Among the tragic conditions in the western region, Fufeng and Wugong counties are the most severely affected. Early on, this was lamented by people at home and abroad. Only one or two tenths of the survivors remain. No more than three or four percent of the land is cultivated. Last year, there was no rain for planting wheat, and the seedlings were originally weak. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of March 12, a cloudy wind arose on all sides. A drizzle of rain sprinkled the dust. In the evening, a hurricane arose, with flying sand and stones, shaking the trees and houses, and it did not stop all night. The weather turned cold, and water dripped into ice. The months were cold beyond the severe winter, resulting in the new shoots of wheat seedlings turning black and dying. Rapeseeds, peas, etc., were also pressed to the ground, and their vitality was cut off. Now, there is still no rain, and the north wind is frequently destroying, making it difficult to restore the original state. The harvest this summer is disappointing, and the sound of crying shakes the fields. Desolation fills the eyes. What have the disaster victims done to deserve such poisoning? We beg your newspaper to consider the urgency of the disaster victims and, with the utmost intention of saving them, list them in the newspaper so that kind and virtuous people at home and abroad can learn of the suffering of the disaster and provide benevolent broth and righteous grain to save the dying. All the disaster victims in Fufeng and Wugong counties, Shaanxi Province.</p>
<p>Important News Daily</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to the Attitudes of Russia and the United States</h3>
<p>Strongly Argues that Soviet Russia Has Military Actions The Nagoya Newspaper says: The Soviet government has recently been actively increasing its troops in the Far East. All specialists, such as technicians, architects, drivers, aviators, doctors, and engineers, have been dispatched in large numbers. However, the Soviet government has maintained strict silence on military actions and has not made any clear statement. Recently, the Izvestia newspaper published the fact that the government is paying attention to border defense, which has been fully acknowledged. At the same time, in the Far East, there is correspondence between people in the Soviet Union, stating when the reserves will be called up. On the one hand, Soviet state-owned factories have recently started operating and are about to be fully mobilized. They are actively conducting military training in operating tanks and preventing poison gas. At the same time, they are working hard to promote the importance of national defense. For example, radio theaters and movies all have serious warnings. In particular, Japan's military actions have aroused the attention of the Soviet people.</p>
<p>Criticizes the U.S. Authorities for Not Recognizing Manchuria The Osaka Mainichi Newspaper says: U.S. Secretary of State Stimson was greatly angered after Foreign Minister Xie Jieshi of the government of Manchuria issued a diplomatic note to the governments of seventeen countries on March 20. Stimson, in his personal capacity, issued an emphatic statement, saying that with the exception of Japan and Russia, we should unite with other countries and absolutely not recognize this note. The Japanese government's diplomatic authorities criticize the U.S. for inciting other countries not to recognize Manchuria, accusing it of the first point of insufficient understanding. It also said that the construction of Manchuria was not based on national self-determination, but entirely due to Japan's military force. It also cited Article 2 of the Nine-Power Treaty, mistakenly recognizing Japan as an aggressor, which is the second point of the Empire's dissatisfaction. Even taking the name of the Empire exercising its right of self-defense to form today's new situation in Manchuria, wanting the Empire to bear all the customary obligations under international law, is the third mistake of the United States.</p>
<p>Japanese Sasebo Fleet</p>
<h3>Disturbing Our Country's Coasts</h3>

<p>According to the Nagoya Newspaper, a dispatch from Sasebo reports that the combined fleets led by Commander Kobayashi have completed their preparations and are conducting large-scale exercises in the coastal areas of China.

These two fleets completed training in the Terashima Strait on the 28th and 29th of last month and set sail on the 30th. In addition, the First Destroyer Squadron led by Colonel Ajiuchi is currently training in torpedo launches. Aside from the First Squadron which departed on the 28th of last month, and the Second Destroyer Squadron which set out for Dalian and Qingdao on the 29th, the combined fleets are also conducting joint large-scale exercises in the eastern sea of China stretching to the Korean Strait.</p>
<p>Hee-Chia</p>
<h3>Again Seeking Peace with Ding and Li</h3>
<p>Li Guilin Goes to Persuade Ding Chao</p>
<p>Wang Zhiyou Attends the Harbin Conference</p>
<p>Volunteer Armies Launch a Major Offensive Against Jilin and Harbin</p>
<p>A Harbin dispatch states that Li Du is currently in Yilan, establishing a long-term factory to actively manufacture ammunition and replenish military supplies. Ding Chao, on the other hand, is in Baoqing, Muling, and Yanshou, where he has demarcated areas for self-governance, issued paper currency, and subsidized military expenses. Hee-chia, deeply fearing that Li and Ding's deep-rooted influence would be detrimental to him, dispatched Li Guilin, the pseudo-commander of the Jilin Garrison, to Harbin on March 23rd, together with Zhang Shu, the director of the East Railway Supervision, to seek compromise from Ding and Li on the eastern front. Zhang Shu, fearing danger, avoided going. Li Guilin, however, arrived alone at Zhuhe on the Harbin-Suifenhe line on the evening of the 23rd and requested by telephone to see Wang Zhiyou, the front-line commander of the Self-Defense Army. Wang cabled back his permission. Li then first went to Ping'an Fort, eighteen li from Zhuhe, that night to meet Wang, who led him overnight to Liangzhuhe, eighty li from Zhuhe, to meet Generals Ding Chao, Xing Zhanqing, Zhao Yi, and Chen Decai. Li used the argument that peace would benefit both sides, otherwise the Japanese army would attack, and negotiations continued all night. Ding and others then dispatched Wang Zhiyou with three attendants to Harbin to meet with Japanese generals Domon and Dohihara. Wang arrived in Harbin on the 24th at noon. That day, Guo Enlin, the pseudo-chief of the Jilin Military and Political Office who was waiting in Harbin for news, immediately reported the results of Li Guilin's negotiations back to Jilin by airplane. In the evening, the Japanese special service agency held a meeting, but because they had not yet received Hee-chia's intentions, they only briefly discussed their respective intentions. On the afternoon of the 25th, Guo Enlin returned to Harbin by airplane with Hee-chia's orders. The conditions he brought regarding Li Guilin's meeting with Wang Zhiyou, which were approved, are as follows: (1) The clause regarding the restoration of the original positions of all generals of the Self-Defense Army should be changed to state that Ding and Li must first be relieved of their military power, while other brigade commanders may be restored to their positions; (2) The clause regarding the various brigades continuing to serve as railway protection troops and garrisoning the Harbin-Suifenhe line is absolutely impossible, and Li Du continuing to lead troops stationed in Yilan is also not approved; (3) The clause regarding the payment of three months' salary can be arranged. On the same day, Domon and Dohihara again invited Wang and Guo to a meeting at the Second Division Headquarters. Wang then stated that Hee-chia's approvals were completely different from Li Guilin's proposals and dared not make a decision. He immediately dispatched Yang Gaoru, who had come with him, to rush back to Liangzhuhe to report. Wang remained in Harbin to await further instructions. However, according to another report, the Self-Defense Army has recently been in contact with the National Salvation Army units of Wang Delin, Liu Wankui, and Li Qingshan, and their momentum is very strong. They have decided not to cooperate with Hee-chia. Wang Zhiyou's visit to Harbin was to inquire about the truth of the military situation, and military action cannot be stopped immediately. Today, according to those returning from the Harbin-Suifenhe line, the sound of artillery fire between Hengdaohe and Shalahezi is very intense. A unit of the Japanese army has retreated from Hailin towards Wuzhuhe, surrounded by Liu Wankui's unit of the National Salvation Army. The fierce battle has been going on for half a day. The Japanese army has suffered many casualties. The area above the Yimianpo Hailin station has been recovered by Liu Wankui. Ning'an, Bamiantong, Dongjingcheng, and the Muling Railway and Lishuzhen are all garrisoned by Liu's army. The Sanchakou near Dongning is garrisoned by a thousand members of the local militia, who have recently been led by the militia chief Jiang Haishan to join Liu's army. The Japanese army used four armored trains to carry troops to attack this National Salvation Army unit, but because the eastern line is mountainous, Liu's army lay in ambush in the mountains, not appearing during the day and attacking at night, causing the armored trains to be ineffective. Furthermore, because Zhao Yi's brigade of the Self-Defense Army appeared in Liangzhuhe, threatening to cut off the Japanese army's return route, the Japanese army that had gone to Dongshanli all retreated and gathered in Wuzhuhe. The Amano and Murai brigades of the Japanese army stationed in Harbin were ordered to provide assistance. Because the East Railway refused to allocate trains, they requisitioned large automobiles in the city to transport them, but they only went as far as Mao'ershan and Wuzhuhe and did not dare to go any further, only using airplanes to reconnoiter and drop bombs all day long. The two counties of Yanshou and Fangzheng, because they are the areas where the Self-Defense Army is stationed, have been bombed by Japanese airplanes for days, destroying many civilian houses and causing casualties among soldiers and civilians, but the effect on threatening the Self-Defense Army's strength is minimal. Binzhou was captured on the 24th by the Self-Defense Army led by Gong Zhanhai. A regiment of Hee-chia's bandit army fled in disarray, and its cavalry fled to Huangshan Zuizi in eastern Harbin, causing great panic in Harbin. The Japanese General Domon then ordered his basic team leader, the Kawagawa brigade, to take seven airplanes to defend. Yu Shengteng also led a brigade of bandit troops to go. On the 25th, a fierce battle occurred in Bin County. Three Japanese aircraft dropped many bombs on the county seat, and a fierce fire broke out in the city. Business associations and other groups pleaded with Gong's army to withdraw. Gong, in response to the pleas of the merchants and residents, withdrew from the city, and is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. The National Salvation Army led by Wang Delin, numbering approximately 5,000, recently attacked Huangnihezi on the Jidun Railway, and the line is now impassable. The Japanese army dispatched an armored train to engage in fierce fighting with Hee-chia's bandit army, the Liu Pantou and Qu Baoying regiments. As for Li Qingshan's unit of the Righteous and Brave National Salvation Army, which occupied Fuyu, they once advanced to the outskirts of Changchun on the 22nd. A thousand of Hee-chia's cavalry surrendered to the army. The situation in Changchun was dangerous that day, and Puyi even had the intention of fleeing. The situation eased slightly after the Japanese garrison came to their aid, but Li's unit has not gone far, and the pseudo-capital of Changchun has not yet escaped danger. At present, the righteous armies in the Northeast are rising like swarms of bees, and the morale of the people is high. If the former leaders of the Northeast have the determination to punish the traitors, then the two provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang, even with the Japanese army, can be pacified with a proclamation.

<h3>Bombing in Tianjin</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Shops Were Bombed, Fortunately No One Was Injured</p>
<p>Rumored to be the Work of the Leifeng Team to Punish Unscrupulous Merchants</p>
<p>A Tianjin dispatch states that last night (the 27th) at 7:30 PM, when pedestrians were thronging in front of the Majiakou in the French Concession, a loud explosion suddenly erupted in front of the Huazhu Silk Shop, shattering the glass of the shop's front door, causing temporary chaos. At about 8:00 PM, the front door of the Heji Foreign Goods Store on Route 6 in the French Concession was also bombed, and an explosive was also discovered at the Dunqinglong South Store of the French Barracks, leaving a crack on the wall. A bomb was also discovered in front of the Chengji Paper Store at the northeast corner of the city, but it did not explode. Simultaneously, explosions occurred at the Hexing Bank, Tongde Cotton Yarn Store, Gongyu Paint Store, and Juxingyong Foreign Cloth Store in Erduo Hutong. An unexploded bomb was also found at the Longchang Seafood Store on North Majia Road. After the incident, the French Municipal Council and the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched personnel to inspect the various locations, and only found many fragments of iron at the bombed locations. The bombers had long since disappeared, so there was no way to solve the case. It is rumored that this was the work of the Leifeng Team, an organization of patriotic youth, because the bombed merchants were all selling enemy goods and had lost their conscience, which was hated by patriotic youth.

<h3>Illness Gradually Worsening</h3>
<p>Residing in the Mountains for a Long Time, Dispersing Attendants</p>
<p>A Jinan dispatch states that the chairman of the provincial government, Han Fuju, dispatched Bureau Chief Niu Zhao and Liu Xizhong to visit Feng Yuxiang again because the mayor of Jinan, Wen Chenglie, reported that Feng Yuxiang's illness had worsened after returning from Mount Tai. Liu took a car to Tai'an early yesterday (the 30th) morning and returned to Jinan at 6:00 PM in the evening. According to Liu, Feng's illness has gradually worsened. When I (Liu referring to himself) arrived at Puzhao Temple, Feng had declined all visits from guests. Because I am an old friend, I entered his sick room. Feng's cheeks were gaunt, and his spirits were not as good as when he met Chairman Han a few days ago. He was reading a book. I advised him to stop reading for now and rest his mind. Feng said that because he felt his knowledge was insufficient, he was eager to read, and that only reading could dispel his sorrow and calm his mind. When Feng spoke, he coughed frequently, but there was no blood in his phlegm. Feng has now decided to take a long-term rest. All incoming letters and telegrams will not be opened or read. The telephone line connecting Puzhao Temple to the foot of the mountain has been disconnected. He is summoning his children to live with him in the mountains and dispersing his attendants, and is also instructing Deng Zhexi to find suitable jobs for them so that they do not have to follow him again. Therefore, those currently with Feng are only his wife, Li Dequan, his secretary, Wang Shijiu, his doctor, Chen Chongshou, and Dr. Cai. According to the doctor, Feng's illness is not suitable for medication, and it is best to eat lilies, so someone was sent to Jinan to buy them. (31st)</p>

It circled around the city for an hour, the first time a Japanese plane has reconnoitered in this manner. Yesterday's newspapers reported that a Japanese plane had crashed in Shihudang, with the aircraft completely destroyed and two injured pilots rescued and transported back by another aircraft.

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Ma Weili Discusses the Northeast Problem and the League of Nations (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>(5) The Misconceptions of European Politicians and Diplomats. But we would be unfair to place all the blame (i.e., cunning and irresponsibility) of the Jews on the American government. The atmosphere expressed by Washington does not differ greatly from that expressed by the capitals of other great powers. The instinctive reaction of European politicians and diplomats is not favorable to China. This is undeniable. The reasons for this are varied. Most diplomats do not have much faith in the League of Nations and post-war</p>
<p>new international law. And naturally, in this matter, the experts on Far Eastern affairs among the diplomats must be allowed to speak. During their tenures in the Far East, these people have all had disagreements with China</p>
<p>over the issue of unequal treaties. Thus, the Japanese seize the opportunity to use their means to present themselves as defenders of the sanctity of treaties, especially regarding unequal treaties, making diplomats around the world feel that Japan is fighting for the common interests of all countries.</p>
<p>What European politicians fear is that the strict implementation of the Covenant and its sanctions may not be permitted by the current world situation. The Japanese government is most familiar with this situation, so its methods are extremely swift, which we must acknowledge. Japanese propaganda in Europe has the underlying message that the Manchurian problem is a matter of upholding treaties. Therefore, what Japan is defending is precisely the right that European countries are about to sacrifice greatly. The Japanese government has even declared in Tokyo that Japan will disregard the orders of the League of Nations and resolutely implement military sanctions. This situation has made European politicians very fearful, and their worries are currently very serious.</p>
<p>(6) The League of Nations is Controlled by Secret Agreements. But after all these observations, we cannot ignore the importance of another observation. The era in which we live today is a transitional era. The implementation of new international law is inevitably constrained by the secret agreements that existed before the League of Nations and by recent secret agreements. In the atmosphere of the League of Nations, everyone knows that the weakness of the Administrative Council is largely due to the secret agreements between Japan and the great powers regarding the Manchurian problem. These secret agreements have no legal value. These secret agreements have not been registered with the League of Nations Secretariat and are contrary to the Covenant, effectively making them doubly invalid. But what we value at this time is not the legal value of these agreements, but the fact that people generally recognize and want to abide by these agreements, so that their actions in the League of Nations Administrative Council are weak and even stagnant. All of these points are sufficient to explain why the League of Nations dares not clearly implement the provisions of the Covenant.</p>
<p>(7) Errors in China's Diplomatic Maneuvering. Finally, for the sake of complete analysis, one more point must be added. The Chinese government did not dare to decisively place full responsibility on the Administrative Council. If China had earlier possessed stronger military resistance, then Japan would have found it difficult to deny that the Manchurian incident was not a war. If China had earlier proposed Article 15, then the Administrative Council would have found it difficult to evade responsibility, and since the two parties to the dispute would not have to vote, the resolution of October 24 would not have had a mandatory nature. Therefore, China, in its diplomatic maneuvering, has also weakened the actions of the Administrative Council, causing the Administrative Council to unintentionally tend towards a state of inaction. This is not something we wish to criticize.</p>
<p>(8) Ominous Signs for the Future of the World. In short, this matter has caused the League of Nations to be more resentful than China, because China has gained considerable satisfaction from the facts, such as the dispatch of the Manchurian Investigation Team, which allows China to present everything before an impartial court. The various disputes that have occurred in Manchuria have long been caused by the ambiguous and illegitimate contents of various rights. Japan's sudden advance into Manchuria was unexpected and has given the world an opportunity to pay attention to an area that Japan wants to pay attention to alone. The League of Nations Investigation Team can have considerable</p>
<p>practical value in this regard and should not be underestimated. What the League of Nations Investigation Team has contributed to China should be regarded as a just satisfaction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the League of Nations itself has nothing to be proud of in this incident. The weakness of the Administrative Council has proven that the actions of the League of Nations can be constrained by secret agreements that the League of Nations has never recognized. This is an ominous sign for the future, and we are at the time of the Disarmament Conference, with the issue of security being the main key to the conference. This omen is not a good omen. All of these past events are sufficient to give people a reason to undermine the Disarmament Conference. The reason why the actions of the Administrative Council cannot show any firmness is precisely this. (The End)</p>
<p>Children's Day Special Issue, Inscribed by Cai Yuanpei</p>
<h3>Letter to the Public on Children's Day</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association has petitioned the government to designate April 4th as Children's Day, with April 4th of this year as the first session. This is to implement the late Premier's principle of "providing for the young" in the Book of Rites, Datong. Our country's memorial days include Double One, Double Five, and Double Ten, which all have significant meanings. Children's Day is Double Four, which commemorates children all over the country, and thus commemorates the new atoms that constitute the new life of the Chinese nation. Its significance is even greater than the previous ones, because the former commemorates what has been inherited, while the latter commemorates what is to come. Our people should know that although children temporarily belong to the family, most of their future belongs to the country. Therefore, we should adhere to the principle of Datong in the Book of Rites, regard all children in the country as our own children, and vigorously promote the doctrine of child welfare to improve the narrow family concept, so as not to betray the great intention of the China Child Welfare Association in advocating Children's Day. There are no parents in the world who do not love their children, but the neglect of children's education and the abuse of children cannot be avoided. This is tantamount to destroying the flowers of the new life of the Republic of China, which is contrary to the doctrine of child welfare. If there is such an act, our people have the right to interfere. This is especially what our people should know. Therefore, the meaning of Children's Day has two aspects: positive and negative. Both should be emphasized and expressed specifically</p>
<p>to tell the people of the country.</p>
<h3>On Children's Day, Speaking to All Adults in the Country by Chen Heqin</h3>
<p>The children of today are the citizens of tomorrow. Everyone knows this sentence, and no one can deny it. Since children are the citizens of tomorrow, whether our country and society will prosper in the future depends entirely on whether these children receive a good education now and whether they can become good citizens in the future. As for how to educate children to make them good citizens, this is the sole responsibility of us adults.</p>
<p>When it comes to educating children, we must first understand their physiology and psychology, and know the characteristics of children's physical aspects and the developmental stages of their psychological aspects. Only then can we know how to teach them and how to nurture them, so that they can develop strong bodies, form good habits, gain rich experiences and knowledge, and become healthy citizens to contribute to our future country and society.</p>
<p>Let us first talk about children's physiology. The appearance of children's bodies seems the same as that of adults, but in reality, it is not. The proportions of the head and limbs to the body are very different from those of adults. The structure of the bones, the density of the blood, and the digestive power of the stomach and intestines are also vastly different. Because the hands and feet are short and the bones are soft, children should have small tables and chairs and clothes that fit their bodies. Otherwise, if the lengths and heights are not commensurate with the body, not only will development be greatly affected, but the physique may even become deformed. Because children's digestive power is not as good as that of adults, they should eat foods that are nutritious and easy to digest. However, looking at the general concepts and attitudes of adults in society towards children, it is far from the above conditions. Public places lack facilities for children, and in families, adults are generally considered to be the center. In terms of eating, children are forced to eat what adults eat. In terms of sitting, children are forced to sit on large tables and chairs that adults sit on. In terms of dressing, children are also forced to wear adult-style clothes. All aspects of life take adults as the standard. Children seem to be small adults in concrete form. This disregard for children's status and the trampling of children's characteristics is very dangerous. Therefore, our first urgent task now is to treat children as children. In other words, children should occupy a considerable position in society and receive considerable treatment.</p>
<p>Speaking from the psychological aspect of children, children like to play games, like to imitate, and are curious. Let us just talk about the layer of children's love of imitation. When children are less than one year old, they will imitate simple sounds and simple actions, such as chicken crows and dog barks, brushing their teeth and washing their faces, and other similar simple tones and movements. As soon as they hear or see them, they will imitate them. When they are two years old, this imitation ability gradually develops. They will imitate more complex actions such as sweeping the floor and washing clothes when they see them. When they are three or four years old, their imitation ability is very developed. They will imitate ceremonies such as preparing for sacrifices and celebrations, as well as public gatherings when they see them. Because they imitate what they see, various habits gradually form. At this time, the social environment and the actions of adults in the family can affect children's character in every way. If children hear people scolding in the family often, they will unknowingly scold people too. If they see adults spitting everywhere, they will also unknowingly spit everywhere. They do not know whether scolding people is good or bad, nor do they know whether spitting everywhere is good or bad, but they do it because they see adults doing it. Over time, it will become a habit. Therefore, the first thing parents should do is to set an example in all aspects of character and</p>
<p>life. The second thing is to choose a good environment so that what children see and hear are all good things, and what they imitate are all good actions. Imperceptibly, they can be called to form good habits and good character. The story of Mencius' mother moving three times is the best example.</p>
<h3>The Significance of Commemorating Children's Day During a National Crisis</h3>
<p>By Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the China Child Welfare Association</p>
<p>Our country designated April 4th as Children's Day, an initiative championed by this association. It began last year, but unfortunately, by the time we received the government's approval and directive, it was already late, and we couldn't hold a commemoration. Now, as the joyous festival approaches, we also find ourselves in a time of severe national crisis. Farmers lament in the fields, merchants sigh in the marketplaces, laborers halt their work, and scholars abandon their studies. Society is uneasy, and the whole nation is shaken. We are preoccupied with saving the nation and ensuring its survival, so how can we have the leisure to focus on children and hold a grand-scale commemoration for Children's Day?</p>
<p>However, children are truly the masters of the world. Today's adults were once children, and today's children will become tomorrow's adults. The cycle of renewal is a crucial mechanism. Therefore, Western philosophers say, "A nation's progress in civilization follows the footsteps of its children," and "Children are the movers of the Earth." Not only do Western philosophers have these views on the importance of children, but our ancient sages also held them. Confucius said, "The younger generation is to be held in awe." Mencius said, "Love your own young, and extend that love to the young of others." All of these sayings illustrate that children are the lifeblood of a nation, the engine of civilization, the vitality of a country, and the essence of society. They are fundamentally important and cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, from this perspective, how can we disregard Children's Day due to the current national crisis?</p>
<p>Cultivating healthy individuals leads to a healthy society, and fostering a healthy society builds a healthy nation. Cause and effect are intertwined, and the principle is unfailing. Therefore, in recent years, we have advocated this idea, promoted our association, and repeatedly informed our fellow citizens. However, child welfare efforts are still in progress, and foreign aggression continues to come one after another. The foundation has not yet been solidified, and it is already being undermined. Our strength has not yet been fully developed, and we are already being attacked. Looking ahead, we are deeply fearful. Those who are now trying to save the nation are talking about how to improve politics or how to expand military power. Yet, no one is focusing on the children, who are the future of the nation. No one is planning for their care and education. Instead, they treat children as if they are irrelevant to the health of the nation. They truly do not understand the meaning of ten years of gathering resources and ten years of education. Saving the nation from the current crisis depends on the adults of today. However, if we want to promote national glory and permanently eliminate foreign aggression, so that our five-thousand-year-old Chinese nation can stand tall in the world, then we must do everything possible to protect the health and foster the growth of all the children in the country. Only by providing for their survival, nurturing their development, strengthening their bodies, and enhancing their intellect can we achieve lasting effects of internal stability and external resistance.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the strength of a nation depends on the quality of its children's upbringing and education. Therefore, the significance of holding Children's Day during this national crisis is far greater than that of ordinary commemorative holidays. There is no need to elaborate further. I dare to take this opportunity to further clarify its meaning as follows: It must be understood that children belong to the nation, not to any single individual. Therefore, the nation should be responsible for their education and upbringing. Looking at various European and American countries, they all have various institutions dedicated to child care, fulfilling their responsibility to educate and raise children. This is one aspect. Children's education and upbringing must have equal opportunities, regardless of whether they are rich or poor, or whether they have fathers or elder brothers. Everyone should be able to get what they need, free from worries about food and clothing. They should all have the opportunity to learn and develop their talents, starting from the beginning and planning for the end, so that they can become healthy individuals who can stabilize society and strengthen the country. This is another aspect. It is hoped that wise people across the country will publicize this idea, encourage society, and urge the government to promote the development of child welfare and build a long-term plan for nurturing people. If from now on, the national crisis is resolved and foreign threats never return, then our commemoration of Children's Day today will not have been in vain.</p>
<h3>The Understanding That Elementary School Teachers in This City Should Have When Commemorating Children's Day This Year</h3>
<p>By Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education</p>
<p>Children – what a sweet and lovely term. Children are the hopeful masters of the future world. We love children at all times. For the sake of the happiness of the future world, we feel that children are even more precious and lovable. The holding of Children's Day is truly a new system that respects the status of children. Since the Ministry of Education issued an official notice in the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931] to all provinces and cities regarding measures for commemorating Children's Day on April 4th, this year is, of course, the first time that Children's Day is being commemorated. During that period, a powerful enemy was invading Shanghai, and many children in this city sacrificed their studies to fight against the enemy, and some even lost their lives. In this environment where a powerful enemy is unreasonably destroying the children of this city, to hold a grand and solemn ceremony to respect the status of children, one cannot help but feel the importance of the work of elementary school teachers and the greatness of their responsibility. Therefore, I respectfully offer the following three points to the elementary school teachers in this city: First, as elementary school teachers commemorating Children's Day, we should be down-to-earth and devote our entire lives to the research and improvement of children's education. We should sacrifice our own hopes for the benefit of children. We do not want to sacrifice the happiness of the majority of children for our own benefit.</p>
<p>Second, the goal of our children's education from now on should be to think about the group and the country, and to cultivate lively, healthy, and well-rounded children who are willing to serve the public. From now on, there should be no more selfish children.</p>
<p>Third, physical health and scientific research are the two most needed educational goals for children in our country. From now on, our elementary schools should have more active and practical preparations for health education and science education.</p>
<p>In short, commemorating Children's Day is to encourage children's interest and inspire children's love for the group and the country, and for teachers, it is the sole driving force for rectifying their spirits and working hard in the cause of children's education. The national crisis has not ended, and the key to the survival of the nation depends entirely on the grassroots work of our beloved elementary school teachers. We should firmly believe that the rise and fall of the country is in the hands of the great power held by elementary school teachers. From now on, the future masters of the country, after being planted and cultivated by our elementary school teachers, it will not be difficult for us to restore the broken rivers and mountains through our future efforts. In that case, the holding of Children's Day seems to be a swearing-in ceremony for our elementary school teachers to save the country through education. I am at Children's Day... [fragment of a sentence indicating harmony, likely omitted in original document]...north and south are the same, and... the '3/3', '5/5', '7/7', '9/9' and now the '10/10' festivals, reflect each other without conflict, and are associated with a benevolent warfare division... [likely omitted in original document]...etc.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on March 13th, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau issued approval No. 7586, stating:</p>
<p>Received and read the submission. The matters presented are not without merit. Apart from approving the submission to the Municipal Government for forwarding to the National Government for review and instruction, a meeting will be held at 3:00 PM on the 16th of this month, inviting representatives from the Public Security, Education, and Health Bureaus, as well as the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation, to solicit their opinions. It is requested that the association send a responsible representative to the bureau at the designated time to attend the meeting and present their views. This is the approval.</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association, accordingly, prepared materials on that day and drafted an outline of measures. They sent representatives to attend the joint meeting of the Social Bureau. The result was that this matter concerned the whole country. Since the matter had already been submitted to the Municipal Government for forwarding to the National Government for review and instruction, the meeting concluded that the matter should be held after the National Government issued a clear order to hold the event.</p>
<p>The association received Order No. 8447 from the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau on April 2nd, stating:</p>
<p>To inform you that this Bureau has reviewed the association's application to forward the proposal to designate Children's Day, which was previously submitted to the Municipal Government for forwarding to the National Government for review and instruction. This has already been communicated to you on file. Now, Directive No. 7779 of the Municipal Government is cited, stating that a letter from the Secretariat of Civil Affairs of the National Government has been received, stating that the Chairman has forwarded to your Municipal Government the submission from the Social Bureau, which forwarded the application from the China Child Welfare Association to designate April 4th as Children's Day, etc., for review and instruction. This matter has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for instruction. Accordingly, this order is issued to inform the association. Also, on May 20th, a letter was received from the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education of the National Government, stating:</p>
<p>A directive from the Executive Yuan has been forwarded by Minister Jiang [Chiang Kai-shek], stating that regarding the proposal to designate April 4th as Children's Day, the Central Government has instructed the National Government to forward it to the Ministry of Education to formulate commemorative measures and promulgate them to elementary schools and kindergartens nationwide. The measures are to be formulated by the Ministry of Education. This should be followed. However, since this case was initiated by your association, demonstrating your enthusiasm for child welfare, in view of the foregoing, your association is hereby requested to contribute your opinions for reply, so that they may be considered and forwarded. We greatly appreciate your collaboration.</p>
<p>Therefore, the association drafted a letter of opinion on the commemorative measures for Children's Day and submitted it to the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education on May 21st, awaiting selection and implementation. Subsequently, an official notice from the Ministry of Education of the National Government was issued to the Education Departments of various provinces and cities, stating:</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal from the China Child Welfare Association to designate April 4th as Children's Day, the Executive Yuan Yang Shu Office previously forwarded a letter to the Ministry, and after joint discussion with the Ministry of Interior, it was deemed feasible. The two ministries have jointly replied to the request to forward it on file. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan No. 2174 instructed [likely a reference to a quotation from a Classic text, now lost], "Old as I am, [I will treat] others as I would treat my own aged.</p>
<p>Young as I am, [I will treat] others as I would treat my own young." [This] expands human [kindness/nature.]</p>
<p>[One] does not only [treat] one's own aged, [nor only loves] one's own child."</p>
<p>Commemorative Title for Children's Day, April 4th, Year 21 [of the Republic]</p>
<p>We should celebrate the future of all the children in the city, but I should also wish all the elementary school teachers in the city in advance success in fulfilling their responsibility to save the country through education.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the Establishment of Chinese Children's Day (By Chen Zhengfan)</h3>
<p>A Western philosopher has said, "The eighteenth century is the century of man, the nineteenth century is the century of women, and the twentieth century is the century of children." When we look at the recent decades, scholars from various countries have competed to advocate for the happiness of children, forming children's societies and establishing child welfare organizations, countless in number. This is enough to show that this statement is not inaccurate and makes people believe it deeply. Although our ancient Chinese nation had early sprouts of child welfare thought, it was only in the last three or four years that it brewed into a clear consciousness, developed into a universal movement, and used the power of group organizations to plan to promote the national child welfare cause. Furthermore, the National Government, based on the request of the China Child Welfare Association, promulgated Children's Day commemorative measures last year and issued notices to hold them throughout the country, which has attracted the world's attention and left an extremely valuable mark in Chinese cultural history. It is necessary to describe this in detail.</p>
<p>On March 7th, the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], the China Child Welfare Association submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, which forwarded it to the Municipal Government, which forwarded it to the National Government, to designate April 4th as Children's Day. The submission reads as follows:</p>
<p>Submission for the Petition to Hold Children's Day, Please Approve the Forwarding to Promote This Cause. I humbly submit that the prosperity of the nation depends on the people, and the strength of the people depends on the children. Children are the future masters of the country and the center of cultural transformation. All countries in the East and West pay attention to the children's cause, so there are children's laws, children's courts, and children's affairs bureaus. Geneva also has a formal declaration to protect the rights of children. The United States also designated May 1st as Children's Day, and Japan designated March 3rd as Girls' Day and May 5th as Boys' Day, which are universally followed throughout the country. Examining our country, the Wangzhi [a classic text] has articles on child welfare, and ancient sages have instructions on cherishing the young. It is not that we do not pay attention to the children's cause. However, the country has many misfortunes and frequent disasters. Although the country has established educational officials and various places have built elementary schools and kindergartens, the people's wisdom has not been developed, and many regard this as an insignificant act. At a time when national education is not yet universal and compulsory education has not yet been implemented, without an important indication, it is not enough to awaken the people. I would like to choose a date to designate as Children's Day and follow the example of neighboring countries to submit to the National Government to issue a notice to the whole country to hold a celebration on that day. Lectures should be given everywhere on various measures to protect the rights of children, arouse public attention, make everyone have child welfare thoughts, and make everyone bear child welfare responsibilities. This can also make children aware of their position, so as to expand the scope of child welfare and build a foundation for a strong country and a strong people. If you approve, please designate April 4th as Children's Day and order the subordinate departments to hold celebrations to promote this cause, because the time is right in the spring season and it is also the time for planting and training seedlings. Training Order, The Children's Day Commemoration Measures should be formulated and promulgated by the Ministry of Education, etc. In addition to the Ministry formulating the Children's Day Commemoration Measures and submitting them to the Executive Yuan for the record, and separately issuing notices for implementation, the aforementioned measures are hereby issued to inform the Department for their notification. This is the order.</p>
<p>Thus, the Children's Day promoted by the China Child Welfare Association was formally declared established. From now on, the happiness of Chinese children should be guaranteed, and the future of the Chinese nation should be promoted and enhanced. What joy and dance can we have!</p>
<p>Attached is the National Government's Promulgation of Children's Day Commemoration Measures</p>

<h3>The China Child Welfare Association Prepares for the Chinese Children's Day Commemoration</h3>
<p>April 4th is Chinese Children's Day. The commemoration measures have been promulgated by the Ministry of Education of the National Government and notified to all provinces and regions to hold celebrations on schedule. The China Child Welfare Association, as the initiator of Children's Day, published 20,000 copies of the Children's Day Handbook half a month ago, detailing the origin and significance of Children's Day and the implementation methods, and sent them to government agencies and mass organizations in various places for application. They also collected a number of Children's Day commemorative essays and plan to publish a special issue of the Child Welfare Monthly dedicated to Children's Day to commemorate the event. Mr. Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the association and member of the Central Committee, also plans to give a radio speech on April 4th through the international radio station, discussing the significance of commemorating Children's Day during a national crisis. As for gatherings and parades, they are also being prepared by the association. However, due to the situation in Shanghai, it is still uncertain whether they can be held on a large scale. The Shanghai Children's Bookstore will offer special discounts for one month to commemorate Children's Day, and will also publish a Children's Day commemorative booklet and Children's Day songs.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Dong Provincial Public Education Center has prepared a Children's Day program and plans to hold a large-scale commemoration and publish a booklet called "The Voice of Children," which describes the pitiful lives of twelve kinds of orphaned children, such as maids, bookboys, prostitutes, young monks, young nuns, orphaned soldiers, child laborers, and apprentices, which is very touching.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Children's Times will publish a special issue for Children's Day on April 4th and will offer prizes for essays to encourage readers' interest. The essay titles are "What I Hope My Parents and Teachers Will Teach Me" and "What Kind of Child I Want to Be."</p>
<p>According to news from the Child Welfare Association, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, the Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Education, the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Education, the Peiping [Beijing] Municipal Bureau of Education, the Xiangshan Child Welfare Home, the Hangzhou Municipal Government Municipal Bureau of Education, the Public Education Center, the Jiaxing County Bureau of Education, the [missing text] Youth Association of Japan, the Jinzhou Youth Association, the Suzhou Lequn Society, and the Wuhu Gospel Church will all hold grand commemorations on Children's Day.</p>

<h3>Fluctuations in Gold Prices in the Past Week</h3>
<p>Speculation Differed, Quantities Were Thin</p>
<p>The gold market situation fluctuated slightly last week, with no special rise or fall. Each day, the fluctuations were no more than ten taels, and the market heads were almost the same. The divergent wills of the industry led to differences in receipts and disbursements, but the quantities were not large. The trend weakened from the beginning of the week because optimism was not allowed in the ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference, so a selling atmosphere permeated. Furthermore, the exchange rates of British and American currencies rose frequently, suddenly breaking through 670 taels, with only 68 taels and 3 [missing currency unit]. Afterwards, the silver market diverged, but the situation turned flat, hovering around the 80-tael mark. Later, a certain bank purchased cash extensively, and Guangbang Hengxing and others continued to buy relentlessly. By the end of the week, it was up to 690 taels. The difference in this week's [likely a currency term] was 21 taels and 7 qian. The total increase was slightly increased by</p>
<p>Increased by five qian, it has been rising for five consecutive weeks. However, the cash price was actually five or six taels lower than the futures price due to the interest rate. In particular, the movements of all parties were slow. As for the frequent falls in large bars of silver, the price of American silver rose instead. This was due to the unbridled rise in exchange rates. British currency increased by a total of eight and a half fen against the US dollar, and the US dollar also increased by six and a half fen against the pound. As a result, the Shanghai shilling contracted by three and a half points (875), and the US dollar only contracted by 25. The so-called going in opposite directions, the actual transaction price of the banks seems complicated. The gold speculators and speculators are inconsistent, and the US dollar hedging price is more than 40 taels outside, and the listed price is more than 670 taels. The general situation during the week is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Only Slightly Better by Five Qian on Monday (March 28th)</p>
<p>It happened to be the Western holiday of Spring Break, there was no market for large silver bars, and American silver did not change. However, exchange rates soared, and gold transactions were still suspended to make up for the holiday (Sunday). On Tuesday, there was still no report on large silver bars, and American silver rose by 125. The exchange rate continued to rise greatly, and the shilling fell by more than 875. Due to exchange rates, the US dollar grew by 25. The inner market also showed divergent trends. The initial opening of gold at the exchange was a sharp drop of nine and a half taels, totaling 676 taels and 5 qian. However, buyers bought more and increased by two taels. Soon after, the US dollar loosened, and the big dealers in the market sold out. Then, the shilling strengthened, and the price was 68 taels and 3 after it fell. The buyers made a move and the price rose by seven taels to 75 taels. Then it fell by two taels. The noon closing was 74 taels and a half, a continued drop of 11 and a half taels compared to the closing before the break (March 24th). On Wednesday, the large silver bars [likely a unit of currency, but unclear] fell by 25, the silver price still rose by 375, and the exchange rate diverged. The British currency rose and the American currency fell. The shilling grew by 25, and the US dollar did not change. The inner market saw [missing characters]. The gold market initially opened and settled at 674 taels and a half and then rose and fell alternately. After hearing that a certain bank had opened more than 100 cash deposits, the price surged and broke through the 80-tael mark. The buying side seemed diligent, at 81 taels and 2. The noon closing was 80 taels and two, a rebound of five taels and seven points compared to the previous day. Looking back at noon, there was a 6 tael and 7 difference, but the Dalian help slightly sold, and other companies were more demanding than supply. On Thursday, the large silver bars rebounded from 1875 to 25, the silver price shrank again by 25, the British and American listed prices remained the same, the exchange rate was slightly British and large American. As for the gold market, the initial opening was large by 1 tael and 8, totaling 682 taels. As soon as the price went up to five taels, there was a three- or four-tael market head at noon. The exchange market eased. The total price was 79 taels. At the time of closing, it was 80 taels, and Hengxing came in. Only two qian were reduced compared to the previous day. On Friday, the large silver bars shrank by 25, the silver price did not change, and the exchange rate was reported to have risen again. The shilling shrank by half a level, and the US dollar was as before. The interior was strong in British currency and loose in American currency. The gold market also had a full day of business. The initial opening was 82 taels and 5, then it added up to 86 taels and 5, and then Yuanheng and others sold it, dropping to 78 taels. Later, a certain bank ate 210 cash units, so it added up to 81 taels and 4. There was no selling, but it retreated to 78 taels and 3. The noon closing was 79 taels and 8. The afternoon opened at 80 taels and a half, and then retreated from one and a half taels to 79 taels and 8 [missing punctuation] and then (added up to 823 taels and 3. By the time of the market, it was 81 taels and 9, a rebound of 1 tael and 9 compared to the previous day. [Missing characters] fell again by 1875, the silver price shrank by 125, and the shilling hung [missing characters] 125, and the US dollar [missing characters] half a yuan because the exchange rate between the US and Britain decreased by a small three-point two-five [missing characters] and the inner [missing characters] was flat. The initial opening of gold was 86 taels and 5, plus four taels and six, and then it fell from seven and a half taels to three and a half taels. It was speculative new sales, and another bank [missing characters] absorbed cash, and people's hearts rose. It had [missing characters] 90 taels. By the time of the noon closing, it was 86 taels and a half, adding another four taels and six, compared to the previous day. After the market, due to the market on Saturday, now the high and low prices of the British and American money markets and the exchange gold are described separately below:</p>

<p>Gold 690 taels 668 taels and 3 qian Increase five qian</p>
<h3>The Drop in Foreign Coins Has Slowed Slightly</h3>
<p>The Rising Trend of Guangdong Fish Turned Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, the downward trend of foreign coins in the morning was still strong, at seven qian and eight li, which was still a small seven hao and a half lower than the low price of the previous afternoon. In the noon market, the sellers showed weakness. Although there was little human intervention, as no one was willing to purchase, the price was bound to increase, so it increased by half a li, to seven qian and eight li and a half. As a result, it was only three hao and a half lower than the previous afternoon. The silver dismantling in the early and noon markets was still one qian and six fen, making out exchange bills of 160,000 in the early market and 155,000 in the noon market. There was no transaction in banknotes in either market. The banks were closed on Sundays, and there was no information. Money industry peers dismantled approximately 900,000 in both markets. The public receipts for foreign coins were over 2,300,000, the public receipts for silver coins were over 17,700,000, and small money houses traded more than 300,000. As there were few transactions in the Jiangnan small foreign coins, the market price dropped sharply by two thickness and more. The early market was six qian and two fen, and the noon market was one fen and eight li. There were 3,500 horns of transactions in the early and noon markets. The Guangdong small foreign coins suddenly increased by four or five li, with the early market being six qian and two fen and two and a half li, and the noon market being five li and a half. There were 95,000 horns of transactions in the early and noon markets. Copper coins increased by 1,500, for a total of 415,500.</p>

<h3>Sluggish Cotton Yarn Sales Last Week</h3>
<p>Fortunately, There Were Sporadic Transactions with Sichuan and Guangdong Merchants</p>
<p>The actual demand for cotton yarn was extremely bleak last week. Due to the unresolved Sino-Japanese peace issue and the Japanese troops' failure to withdraw, people were unusually fearful. Financial emergencies made it difficult for funds to circulate, and transportation was difficult, leading to the general stagnation of all businesses. Fortunately, cotton yarn is a daily necessity, so a large volume of business was naturally not expected. However, sporadic transactions with Sichuan and Guangdong inland areas continued uninterrupted. Other merchants were not very active. However, it was found that the yarn market in Guangdong, Sichuan, Jiangxi, and other places has fallen sharply recently, and there are stocks in various places. The price of yarn in the inland areas is lower than that in Shanghai. Judging from this situation, there is little hope for sales to pick up in the future. Fortunately, the Shanghai factories have not accumulated excessive inventory, and prices can still be maintained. It was found that the total amount of purchases by various merchants throughout the week was 1,990 bales, and the peer amount was 200 bales. Market prices fell by one or two taels compared to the previous week. Shenxin Factory offered 200 bales of 20-count "Ren Zhong" yarn at a price of 177 taels and 5 qian. The daily purchase volume of each merchant is listed below:</p>
<p>Merchant	Bale Amount	Merchant	Bale Amount	Merchant	Bale Amount</p>
<p>Sichuan	700	Jiangxi	150	Wuhu	1</p>
<p>Ningbo	83	Inland	338	Northern	61</p>
<p>Guangdong	312	Yunnan	50	Fujian	20</p>
<p>Hankou	60	Miscellaneous	15	Peer	200</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Managed to Hold Last Week</h3>
<p>But Lacked Large-Scale Consumption</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales have been relatively good recently, but large-scale transactions are extremely lacking. This is because the cotton industry situation is still pessimistic. Russian cotton prices are very low in Europe, so there is currently no need to actively purchase raw cotton. However, Shanghai's inventory is low, and factories are slightly purchasing to replenish their supplies, but the four sources of supply are depleted. Therefore, market prices can still remain stable. Shenxin Factory had the largest purchase volume this week, also purchasing 2,000 bales of American cotton. American cotton fell by one or two pounds compared to the previous week. The purchase volume and high prices of each factory are listed below:</p>
<p>Factory	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Bales</p>
<p>Nanyang Brothers	32.0	300 Bales	Spot</p>
<p>Nanyang Brothers		32.3	4,000 Bales	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Xisha	34.0	34.0	Pieces	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Shaanxi	34.5	100 Pieces	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Suzhou	.00	200 Pieces	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Meiwen	34.75	90 Pieces	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Baobao	36.23	100 Pieces	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Squires &amp; Mitchell	34.00	2,000 Pieces	Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<h3>American and British Cotton Moved in Opposite Directions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to a lack of major buyers and the downturn on Wall Street. Later, it strengthened due to some short covering. Futures fell by four to eight points, and spot prices fell by five points. British cotton futures rose by six points, and spot prices rose by five points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by fifteen points. Indian cotton market closed. Original telegram on the left (dated 2nd):</p>

<h3>Thin Rice Suddenly Jumped Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>In South Shanghai, it rained yesterday morning. More than 20 boats arrived from various merchants in the west. The market was relatively active, and people became anxious. The price of inland rose again, and merchants bought 2,000 shi of thin rice, with the opening price jumping half a yuan. Glutinous Su white japonica rice and early thin rice rose by two jiao. Yin Hua Yang tip reached the sales resistance, and the overall market continued to rise. Convertible yuan was scarce and the market was inactive.</p>
<p>In North Shanghai yesterday, twelve or thirteen rice boats from Wuxi, Liyang, Suzhou, Jiaoli, and Songjiang arrived at the south end of the Garbage Bridge. The morning trade was more active than the previous market. More than sixteen or seventeen hundred shi of Wuxi Kunshan goods were also available on the market. The price was raised by three jiao. The thin rice store was not weak, and the price rose by two jiao. Bai Yuan early rice was sold as soon as it arrived, and the price did not rise or fall.</p>
<h3>Hardware and Tinplate Soared</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have been declining since the Shanghai Incident. Although market prices barely held, actual transactions were very sluggish, due to the extremely tight credit and significant obstacles to sales. Only the tinplate business showed signs of soaring. The reason is partly due to the thin existing inventory and limited sources of supply, and partly due to the rising prices, so there are no new orders. The environment is very good. Moreover, many merchants in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou are replenishing their supplies, and supply cannot meet demand. The market is very promising. The current market price for 90-pound British goods is 10 taels and 5 qian, 100-pound is 12 taels and 2.5 qian, 90-pound American goods is 13 taels and 2.5 qian, 100-pound is 15 taels, and Huisi iron is 25 taels. It is reported that more than 1,500 boxes were sold yesterday.</p>

<h3>Italian Silk Factories Are Opening One After Another</h3>
<p>Italian silk sales to the United States are smooth... Supply is insufficient</p>
<p>Italy is a well-known silk-producing country, and the silk factory industry is becoming increasingly developed. Silk reeling technology is also becoming more refined. Silk production is fine and uniform in color and luster, far superior to our country's factory silk. There are more than 2,000 silk factories across the country, with Milan, Como, Bergamo, and other places being the most numerous and the most famous for silk production. After the new silk was put on the market last year, Italian silk prices also plummeted due to the impact of Japanese silk being sold cheaply in European and American markets. The Italian silk factory industry suffered losses, and the Milan raw silk market and European and American silk sales became increasingly sluggish. Silk factories reduced their production and shut down machines. By the end of last year, only 50% of the country's silk factories were operating. Now, due to the American people's launch of a boycott of Japanese goods movement, women's leagues do not purchase Japanese silk or Japanese silk fabrics, which has led to a sudden improvement in Italian silk sales to the United States. European and American silk merchants in Milan have begun hoarding silk, so existing silk stocks are low and supply cannot meet demand. Silk factories are taking advantage of the situation to resume operations. It is now estimated that more than 1,700 silk factories have resumed operations throughout Italy. Unfortunately, the raw material (i.e., dry cocoons) inventory is insufficient. There are still two months before the new cocoons are on the market, and I am afraid that it will not be able to sustain the new market.</p>

<h3>Rather Be a Shattered Jewel Than an Intact Tile</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>The ceasefire conference continued to discuss the deadline for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops. The discussion was divided into two steps. First, the Japanese troops would withdraw from the front line to the area adjacent to the Public Concession. It is said that the Japanese side has agreed to complete the withdrawal within four weeks. The second step, the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the area adjacent to the Public Concession to the original defense before January 28, is still the focus of discussion at the conference. When people with extremely contradictory opinions are gathered together, the opinions of both parties must first be eliminated before they can be harmonized. If the interests of both parties at the conference are extremely conflicting, the partial interests of the proactive party must first be sacrificed before they can be approached. If one party makes concessions and the other party takes an inch and presses forward step by step, this kind of conference has no possibility of compromise from the beginning.</p>
<p>In this ceasefire conference, the contradictions in opinions are like this, the conflicts in interests are like this, and the proactive party is also coercing and hijacking in many ways. It is appropriate that the conference has been held many times, the military sub-committee has been held many times, and the results obtained are still "no progress" and "no hope." As for the key points of the ceasefire conference, according to the announcement by our military authorities, our side insists on the principle that the first step is for the Japanese troops to withdraw to the area within the concession, the second step is to withdraw troops back to the country, and the third step is political issues. These three steps were originally the minimum conditions for our side, but the Japanese side stubbornly procrastinates and wants to put political issues on the table for discussion. Our side will definitely not admit it. Indeed, these three steps are as solid as iron, and no matter what, we cannot retreat another step.</p>
<p>According to recent news from the front, Japanese troops in Taicang are challenging us from time to time. Yesterday, Japanese planes flew in the sky, more than 20 planes, heading west. This kind of means of meeting on the one hand and threatening with force on the other hand is a trick commonly used by the Japanese side. However, with the strategy of our government, the determination of the people, and the enemy's hatred of the soldiers, the government and the people are united and very determined. What is the determination? It is: Rather be a shattered jewel than an intact tile.</p>

<h3>Market News</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Library informs that the Chamber of Commerce Library has not suffered any losses since the Shanghai Incident. Since February, the librarians have been engaged in comfort and relief work. There is a large accumulation of books, newspapers, and magazines, which have now been sorted out and will be reopened as usual on April 1st. Books that have been borrowed previously can be returned and borrowed again.</p>
<p>The library also stated that the various universities in Shanghai have suffered especially from the looting, especially the largest losses of books in the libraries of universities such as the School of Commerce, Labor, Tongji, Zhonggong, Fudan, and Jinan. All universities have relocated their campuses in borrowed locations, and are prioritizing academic work, but students feel extremely pained by the lack of books for reference. The library plans to adopt cooperative book borrowing, book purchasing, and mobile book borrowing methods for schools and organizations, so that they can strive for knowledge in the midst of national crisis.</p>
<p>The Foreign Commentary Translation Agency Regularly Submits Manuscripts The Foreign Commentary Translation Agency is organized by translators Ming Yaowu and Sun Shiyi, and specializes in translating all opinions and records related to Chinese affairs from various foreign newspapers and journals published domestically and from various countries in the East and West.
