<p>時評</p>
<h3>國貨年</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>最近滬上實業界。鋻於國貨凌夷。舶來品充斥市塲。國窮勢蹙。社會經濟日趨破落。有如江河之就下。怵目驚心之餘。特定民國二十二年爲國貨年。擬於此一年以内。合我全國人民之力量。作長期有計劃之國貨運動此一偉舉。其含義之重大。誠有足以令吾人特别嚴重注意者</p>
<p>我國爲生產落後之國家迄至今日。仍尙淪滯於農業經濟之範疇。重以關</p>
<p>税主權旁落。内政不上軌道。工業之保障盡撤。國際經濟侵略之巨潮。遂以一日千里之勢。奔騰席捲而來。　日自給自足之農業經濟社會。早隨此　天之</p>
<p>巨潮而根本發生動搖。漸將淪於破滅。因之而獨立自由之國家。一變而成爲世界之市場。產業先進國家之經濟勢力。縱横馳騁。予取予求。敲骨吸髓血肉皆盡。觀夫歷年我國對外贸易。藎無年不爲大量之入超且年月遞增迄無止息。凡此一點一滴。莫非我全體人民之血汗。往者如斯。來日大難。瞻顧前途。</p>
<p>能不寒心。</p>
<p>是以今日，吾人不欲自拔於殖民地之深淵則已。否提倡國貨。實爲萬不容緩之要圖。不過吾人認爲提倡國貨。當由中上階級做起。藎今消費外國貨者。類爲中上階級人士。普遍之勢働農工。大部分都服用國貨並無須吾人爲之提倡。且提倡國貨。决非空言所可奏效。必一方有精良之國產品可以代替外貨。而其價格。復不高於外貨。則無人不樂於服用國貨。故吾人之意。提倡國貨必檵之以振與實業。使國内有相當生產機關。以供人民需求。則外貨不壓而自倒。國貨不提倡而自風行。</p>
<p>抑猶有尤要之先决間題在政治不清明。社會不安定。則萬事皆末由發展。</p>
<p>如兵匪横行。運輸困難。雖有生產。亦無從迅速出售。苛捐雜税。重重壓迫。雖有廉價之物品。亦必因捐税之增重而加高其價格。致不能與外貨抗衡。凡是種種。眼前之事實。至爲明顯。捨此不圖。其他皆爲枝節。此又吾人於滬上實業界發起國貨年之始。不得不特别鄭重提示者也。</p>
<p>國人乎。今日何日。豈猶是沉沉醉夢之日耶。有志者當執干戈。以馳驅於疆場之間。其次亦當矢志於盡我地方上應盡之責任。致力於一切救國事業。奮</p>
<p>起精神。振興國貨。毌爲舶來品之奴隸。以留我民族生機於一綫。茲當國貨年行將開始之際。吾人谨以萬分之誠意。期望我全國人民一致奮興。共同努力。</p>
<p>提倡國貨。發展實業。使我國勿長淪爲世界之市場而永刦不復。</p>

，走游藝場又是無聊黑暗，嫖和賭自認爲不正當的事件，專心研究學識未免又和日間辦事用心一樣的辛苦，這樣的考慮，那樣的選擇，結果漸漸瀹入舞場而爲荒唐的舞客了，由於囊中充實，面貌漂亮，進身舞場以來，結識舞女不在少數，加以平日慷慨對人，和自己一樣本非相識的舞客，也都成爲知友，場中非理胡閙，也無人嫉妒尋　，舞女和我有性的關係遂得自此發生，一年有餘，竟達二十餘人，其中年齡大都是二十歲以下的居多，也有六個是未滿十六歲的，這樣胡調，銀錢化得不少固係小事，身體可是糟透了今年的秋季，竟累成大病一場，歸家養疴，吃盡苦痛，更貽憂於父母，恢愧之心，莫此爲甚，至今始卒告痊，自問過去之事，人格未免多有損傷，從此立志，誓不再蹈前轍，但在病中，永日留戀牀席讀報消遣時，見本埠欄内常載有舞女向法院訴人遺棄，或各告人强姦未滿十六歲之幼女等等事實，却使我發生了極大的疑　，自思我是道德上有缺陷的人，已受過舞場不正當的洗禮，同多數舞女有過不正當的行爲，更且犯過六個强姦未滿十六歲女子的刑章，罪惡實在不小，可是回憶我的犯罪事實，原因實有不是我自己，却是那般舞女們，就是和未滿十六歲的舞女發生關係，主動者也是她們，尤其使我奇怪的，和我有關係的舞女們，多數不是處女，就是未滿十六歲的幼女，也有四個人已非完璧，由我的犯罪情形，推想到報上所載被舞女所告發犯罪的人的犯罪原因，恐怕未始不和我一樣，不過有口難以聲辯吧，由這種情形看來，造成社會上受刑事裁判的人，却非報上所載受人告發的人，却是告發他人的原告舞女本人自己了，從此社會裹犯罪的人日增月盛，社會本體的惡點，也同時加多，可是受罪的人却是冤盡極了，明明和婦人發生關係而稱爲姦淫未成年的少女，明明主動者是原告，而被動者反犯强姦的刑章，個人的犯罪成立在此，社會的造成惡劣的原因亦在此，請問這種和我一樣犯罪的人的罪名能卸脱嗎？社會上有這種犯罪的原因能設法除去嗎？同時希望解釋舞場是否犯罪的所在地？舞女是否犯罪的原素？上海沒有跳舞場是否能減少犯罪的人？上海沒有跳舞場是否能减少上海社會的劣點？不勝幸甚。　　記者按：我們讀了吳嘉英君這篇素描的「供辭」，並不想對他有什麽責備而且對他的覺悟的態度表示十二分的欽敬。因爲他已經覺悟到過去種種是「罪惡」了，而且在追問一「誰是罪惡的製造者」了。這種覺悟是有意義的，而這種追問尤其是有意義的。我們希望大家共同出馬，爲吳君捉出一個「罪惡的製造者」的「正犯」來。</p>

<p>自由談	按摩　㈡  隠女士「哦·按摩院有什麽好玩？」妻有些莫明其妙的重複的説着。過了些時，妻又問道：「你怎麽想起到按摩院呢去？」　　「當然有人介紹我去，我所要告訴你的，也就是這件事情的經過。當我們吃完飯，在辦公室裏吸着三砲台，喝着龍井茶·在這種安適的環境中，於是乎便大談起女人問題：他們覺得一個人生活疲倦的時候，去玩玩女人，呌女人全身按摩按摩是最美妙的事···简直説這個世界的一切事業興趣，都在性的支配之下，···因此他們便勸我入夥···」　　「哦·原來還有這麽一番大道理呀，這樣説來，你那幾位朋友也有榮膺性學博士的資格了。」　　肖波聽了這話，也笑了道：「你别摀亂，還有下文呢！······我想要搬到學校去住···」　　「爲什麽？」　　　「自然有道理，因爲離家太遠，天天跑來跑去太費時間。」　　「我看，都不成理由，恐怕你是爲了、］到按摩院去方便些吧！」　　「那裏，那裏」肖波笑嘻嘻的掩飾着。　　「你别摀鬼，我的眼睛雪亮···大約這都是他們替你想出來的好方法吧。哼！這倒不錯，有這些以身作則的敎育家，所以現在男女學生的生活才特别豐富。···那麽你打算幾時搬到學校去呢！」　　「鬼話，我騙騙你玩罷了。我果眞要這樣作，還肯把個中秘密告訴你嗎？」肖波笑着説。　　「哦,我果然是個笨蛋，但是我不明白，你爲什麽又不去了呢？」　　「這還不很简單嗎？這種鬼混的趣味太低了，我懶得去。」　　「這樣説來，你還應當進訓練班，請　些駕輕就熟的高明先生指敎！指敎！···不然你的生活永久是不豐富的···我想你在前兩個星期是最熱烈的想去吧？不然你怎麽星期六會那樣不高興呢？···可是我始終是個傻瓜！」　　「不，我從來沒有這種野心。」肖波辯正着。　　「不過人的野心是慢慢的訓練出來的你只要受一些訓練還怕不成功嗎？而且你們這些自命多才多藝的人，總要找點浪漫事跡點綴點綴單調的人生，不然就不夠風流，不夠偉大，更不能引起男人和女人的注意了！」　　肖波聽了這些話，只是看着妻笑。一你笑什麽？」妻假作正經的問他。　　「笑你！」肖波説。　　「我有什麽可笑，　多不過説我倆興趣不同，你便可以獨自行動，爲所欲爲了！去吧，到按摩院去玩吧」　　妻一面説笑着便下樓去收拾夜飯了。肖波望着妻的後影，感到一種觸着玫瑰花瓣似的柔情。（完）長壽運動  陳望道　　近來長壽運動已經盛極一時，所謂百十叟百二十叟的宣傳亦已閙熱到和替要人宣傳不相上下，大約使人入海求神仙及不死藥的千古偉業，不久也就要出現了。　　説到入海求神仙，有些神經過敏的或者就會聯想起焚書坑儒來。但這是現在絶對不會有的事。因爲我們在報上絶對不曾看見記載過。　　現在中國是一個大光明的時代。對於文化是可説愛護無所不至。試看：河南等處，現在正以國家的力量從事發掘。再看：每次會議差不多總有要人也者提出出版言論集會結社的自由的議案來，每次又都毫無困難地通過了。這與「偶語棄市」的時代不同，單看報章便可明白的。　　生在這樣一個大光明的時代，自然該來一個長壽運動。不管怎樣可以存活，只要能夠存活便好！　　據紅十字會醫院幾個外國醫生説：中國人的抵抗力非常的强，往往他們斷定要死，在外國人是不會不死的，而中國人竟還是醫得活。而且活得很長久。因此他們往往挨人駡，説他們診斷得不準確。據此，中國人的長壽運動也可以説是有科學上的根據。大約無論怎樣受人榨絞壓迫，都會活得下去的，能夠活得下去，則無論其爲行尸走肉，爲一切榨絞壓迫的對象，總之就是長壽運動的成功。悲壯的祝福  程耘平　　我們的森兒，是在不被歡迎中誕生了。　　假如一個擁有資產只知享樂的人得到這樣消息的時候，他該是如何地如何地歡欣呀：然而當我接着家裏人的來信，報告我説我們的森兒已經誕生了的時候，我却反而覺得有捺不住的悲愁襲上心來。　　森兒｜你的爸爸直到現在演過來的一塲塲都是悲劇，雖然和你的母親訂婚的那時，也算是我過去半生中僅有的幸福的刹那，但這幸福祇一瞬便消逝了接着來的就是精神上和物質上的苦難｜我有時和你母親默默地坐在燈前，彼此的心都蒙上一層悲痛的陰影，覺得我們彷彿已被命運註定了要來經受這些精神和物質上苦痛的摧殘｜雖然我們根本不相信「命定論」，但貧困的環境是無可掩飾的事實呵｜有時我悲壯地在你母親肩上拍了一拍，我説：「在狂風暴雨中開出來的花是偉大的，我們衝出這困苦的環境吧！」「我們要不避艱苦地來戰鬥。此刻正是我們和惡劣環境戰鬥的開始，也就是我們迫視慘酷人生的開始呵！」在這剛抖擻着精神準備苦鬥的時候，森兒，誰知你却加入我們無力的集團了！　　假如你誕生在那些求子的人家，你會增加人家的歡樂和福氣，你準會受到人家極度的歡迎：然而，我們的森兒呵如今你却是做了我們的累贅，你分散了我們不避艱苦地去拼命苦鬥的精神，你增加了我們此刻就已感受着苦痛的負擔，啊，森兒，你何必苦苦地要誕生在我們的家庭裏來呢？　　我如此憤憤地想了一陣，又極可笑地高興起來。我走到門外去，看閃閃的小星在寒空裏巍巍地戰抖着。我又恨不到飛回家去，把你從你母親的懐裏搶奪過來。我要在你的嫩臉上狠狠地痛吻一下。你哭了，你的母親吃驚了，我也會沉默地站着感到一陣悲壯的暢快罷。　　森兒，你已在不被歡迎中誕生了。你將來享受不到一般兒童們享受的幸福這只怪你自己摸錯了門環。你旣然來了，好吧，就也來加入我們的集團罷｜我不盼望你將來長大成人，可以升官發財：僅希望你要有勇氣跟我們同來披荆斬棘，殺出一條大路。將來我們即使被荆棘刺得滿身創傷，我們可把鮮血滴入酒杯裏面，像葡萄酒一樣痛飲！　　時代的暴風雨正在急劇的展開，森兒，你的父親在這裏爲你的未來祝福，希望你要有迫視「慘酷人生」的勇氣！　　借着程君的力作，祝福我自己的·　　同樣「在不被歡迎中誕生了」的孩子。　　　　　　　　　　　烈文。殺人兇器的歸宿處  嚴　　美國公安局，在最近一年裏面，從一般暴徒手中押收下的兇器，統計有手槍八千四百二十枝·步槍六百三十八枝·刀劍等四百五十件·手槍步槍彈共三萬八千顆。日前已把這些兇器一槪運往大西洋中，抛沉於海底了。可見愈文明的地方，殺人流血的事愈多。談難  傅東華　　凡談之難，固在談之不自由，而亦在談之太自由，故我們的方程式是：　　「今天天氣很好」｜「打倒帝國主義」「實現民主政治」　「反對瓜分中國。」　　按理論，你如果祇要談談而不要幹，至少不要妨碍人家的幹，人家是不妨害你自由談談的。所以你每次談時，最好先對天或上帝或××賭一個咒，説「我不過談談罷了。幹是我决不幹，」那末你應該可以自由得多。　　然而賭咒在中國是誰都知道怎麽回事的，所以偏是那些每星期要賭咒一次的人們偏不肯相信你的賭咒，於是乎你雖賭咒在先也不中用了。此談之所以爲難也。　　而且今之所謂健談家者，大都是自己要幹而不得幹，而後成爲健談家者也。自己要幹不好意思明説，於是乎採用代數的説法。代數的説法云者，各種口號之謂也。及到他們眞個幹上了，這才把千句口號萬句口號都化作一句口號｜　「爲政不在多言。」　　亦有並不想幹而隨便談談者，亭子間裏的賣談者流是也。賣談者流本無可談偏要健談，於是乎也只好隨便拈個口號來做做經義，注疏，考證之類，而「賦得打倒資本主義的資字五言八韻」之類的試帖詩也，因而大可彙編三萬選了，　　然而天下最能了解口號之作用者，畢竟莫以喊口號出身的專家們，故當他們自己的口號用黃袱包好之後，當然不許别人再喊别樣的口號。因此，不管你是自己想幹的健談家，或是自己並不想幹的賣談者，旣然無法可以逐一偵查，便只好皂白不分一槪不許你開口。此談之所以尤難也。　　這樣看來，祇有亭子間裏賣談的朋友才是大大犯不着！　　朋友們，你要幹嗎？那末我們唯有預、祝你擇主而事，擇口號而喊，或則鵬程萬里，或者殺身成仁，當然不好掃你的興子。　　但是你的主人眞靠得住嗎？你對於你的口號眞能有宗敎的信仰嗎？如其不然，那末你爲要繼繼談談起見，不如及早的改絃易轍。　　所謂改絃易轍者，並非要你採取明哲保身的態度，而是要你覺悟一切口號都是野心家的武器，犯不着替它做頌詞，而且談之價值亦决不在口號也。　　朋友們，我們唯有不替任何口號做奴隸，才算得着眞正的自由。蘇州印象記㈢  振甫　　迥廊的一面是小的天井，一面就是廳堂房屋了。屋内的陳設也很精緻，有紅木的桌椅，兩旁的玻窗有幾處用着種種顏色玻璃，因此室内的光綫更覺微弱了。在這種地方，不特沒有物質文明的煩擾，機器的吼聲和車馬的閙聲都聽不到，就是自然界的鳥聲和强烈的使人興奮的陽光，也似乎感不到。他的特點就是幽靜，能夠安靜人煩燥的心，好比在月下的樹林中一樣的幽靜。屋前的天井也不很大，雖處處地方顯出牠的小巧，但也處處地方見得牠的精緻，從屋内到天井裹的階沿石，有的即用假山石做成，在石的周圍，又徧栽着長綠的衣帶草，地上鑲着圓的小石子，或者做出種種花紋，在靠牆的一邊，又多有假山石和花塢，種着天竹子等等，庭的兩旁，或種樹或不種；天井與天井之間，都有荷葉邊的短牆作間隔；牆上的洞門，似也有種種不同的式樣。在這種「曲、徑通幽處」的房攏間，時有情侣們在那兒情話，想不到這種都市文明的特徵，却也帶到了這個純綷中國式的名勝地方來了。　　繞完迥廊曲榭之後，又有一處假山，山上古木蒼然，危亭兀立，山路也很曲折而狹小，上邊繁枝密葉，相互交榮，把整個的天日遮沒了。這種地方，似乎是一個最宜於夏日避署的所在。可惜我門來時正在深秋，所以游客也非常之少。因爲時間已晚，我們沒有勾留許久就忽忽的離去了。　　在路上，使我們感到人類理想的影響之偉大，自從陶淵明做了一篇桃花源的理想的文字，於是就眞個有桃源縣。同時就我們所見到的，無錫的東大池有小桃源，　頭渚也有許多處造得與桃花源相彷彿，這還不是桃花源記一文的影響嗎？現在看到留園的完全摹倣大觀園，還不是紅樓夢的影響嗎？我們相信彿家之所謂業力不滅：雖然一種理想的能否實現，完全有時代背境的關係。但是理想究竟是超時代的，我們又怎能輕視牠呢。　　　　（四）客窗寂寞話天平　　在一個深秋的早上，太陽的光線偷偷地跑進了我們的臥室，把我和我的同學沅都從睡夢中唤了起來。我們是怎樣的欣喜啊，看到了這可愛的太陽，牠把溫和的光散佈到桌上地上牀上，使我們心裹起一種溫暖的快感，尤其是當感謝的，牠替我們帶走了苦雨凄風的惱人印象，而給我們一個溫暖睛麗的开光，使我們忘記了現在是一個被時人詛咒的秋天了。長篇創作時代与愛的歧路二十九  張資平　　海泉聽見又有點不好意思起來了。「你有工夫最好星期日到我們禮拜堂來。保管有你看得中意的靚貨。好麽？」　　他笑着凑近他的頰邊來了。　　「禮拜日那天怕沒得空」　　看見公共汽車駛來了，海泉裝出要上車的姿勢。世光才鬆了搭在他的肩背上的手。　　「請多到我們敎會來。」　　海泉已跳上公共汽車了，只向他點了點首，公共汽車就開了。　　在大馬路口下了公共汽車，又轉搭了電車趕着向北四川路這邊來。他坐在電車裹，愈想愈覺得今天到敎會去的失策。他想，恐怕他們還當自己是個傻瓜吧。　　他立在Ｓ里的弄堂口了。望了望裹面，似乎充滿着一種灰暗而神秘的景象。他覺得自己的胸口也有點跳動。　　「密絲卓雖不算是絶世的美人。但她的那樣活潑的態度，秀麗的面龐，實在是個最大媚力的所有者。」　　他一面想，一面覺得一種道德感在制裁他，於是躊躇了一忽，不知進去好還是不進去好。　　「又不是我自動地到這裹來，是她先約了我的。有什麽可愧的呢？」　　他壯起膽子，踏進來了。但是弄堂裹十分的幽暗，不容易辨認門牌的號數。問了問看弄堂的，才知道十五號是靠左手邊的三弄最後的一家。海泉看見這家屋子是石庫門的二樓建築。門首靠牆，恰恰有一口水門汀作的垃圾箱，有些有機物的屑片和菜葉散亂在垃圾箱的口外和地面上，發散出一種不快的臭氣。海泉便想：　　「原來是這樣的地方。住在這弄堂裹的少有高尙的人家吧。」　　他看見門扉上的一對鐵環，就想敲了。　　「且慢，讓我看看，卓淑華在裹面麽。説不定她們正在吃晚飯。」　　他凝神靜氣地在十五號門首立了一會，聽見裹面有女性説話的聲音，但不是卓淑華的。　　「衰鬼！」　　一個女子在駡的聲氣。　　「唔敢哩！莫揑我啊！」　　另一個女子的哀懇的聲音。　　接着是一陣很快的低聲的私語。海泉覺得有點奇怪，更加不敢敲門了。他禁不住把一隻眼睛貼在門縫上，睞了一下裹面的情形。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言賣長  梅村　　看了賣老，也來談談賣長，事眞凑巧，談起這兩個玩意兒，恰在同一遊戯塲裏，『世界第一長有常樹德』的廣告，和『一百零九歲長鬚老人張再豐』的字，一樣惹人注目，也有一談的價値，　　長，可作長處解，是名詞，在這裏，長是常樹德的長處，拿他長的長處來買錢，所以呌賣長，無論什麽長處，都可賣去換錢，不過爲了命運或地位關係，就各有不同了，　　隨便什麽人都得有一技之長，纔能生存，否則要淘汰，不過赫胥黎的學説是『適者生存』，所以有了長處，還要適應時代的潮流纔行，否則雖要賣長，恐怕也沒有人買吧！不應時的賣長，是要失敗的，甚至於一敗塗地而不堪收拾，所以沒有價値的長處，還是不實爲妙，　　文人的『賣長，』大半藉其才學，記得在去年曾有一個『考試』，文人們方幸有『賣長』的機會，不料是一齣滑稽戲，他們『長』的價格是估好了，爲着不適時效切實一點説，還是命運不佳，所以沒有人買，我想他們眞糊塗，所謂聰明一世，懵懂一時，你想沒有適應時代典型！高跟皮鞋綢緞旗袍，富於曲線美而摩登的｜或有靠山的｜的長處，誰肯買呢？你要『賣長』而偏偏碰着『不買長』的人，他們拳大臂粗，憑你三寸毛椎，濟什麽事？唉！只得吃㾫，　　武人的長處，全恃會『打杖』，有這特長，一定會『飛黃騰達』。因爲這種長處，是極適時效的，確是有價値的長處，可是賣法不同，最好賣到異國去，不要賣在自家人地面上，纔有生路，否則『同室操戈』助長别人乘𨻶的機會，那就一敗塗地而至於不堪收拾，這樣『賣長』簡直活活『埋藏』自已的身子到泥裏去啦！　　年來的『赤匪』，和不久以前的山東『韓劉』案，現在四川的『叔姪串戲』，都不應賣長而『賣長』，東北的所謂『關外小王，應該賣長而不『賣長』，一樣是沒有價値的『自殺政策』，影響國家非淺，和常樹德的『賣長』，文人們想藉考試來『賣長』不可同日而語了，要人的舉足輕重，可以想見，所以他們要賣長，須先看清國界纔好，『生民塗炭』已夠了，這樣的『賣長』免免吧，文藝傷春（一）  王復鼎南北兵氛厲，春光似舊妍，蕭條關塞外，離亂大江邊，風雨愁疆場，陰晴哭杜鵑，魯戈羣已棄，倉粟各方全，成敗寗論命，安危賴選　，諸公幸進壽，好復故山川，其二江水當春滿，山花到眼明，胡兒新奪壘，漢將舊抛營，洛邑修宫殿，金門棄國城，運籌疑有策，未勝忍爲盟，戰死啼冤鬼，流離哭衆生，瓦全何復益，渾欲請長纓，常識橡皮製品之保存法  眞善美　　橡皮製品，若保存不善，足以損害其品質，如乾裂，僵硬，等，故不可不注意及之。有時亦能使此製品，完全毁壞，不能供用。其要點可分爲貯藏，保護及保存，分述於後；　　　貯藏　橡皮品件宜貯存於陰暗而凉之室中。最有害於橡皮者，當爲室中有熱空氧之流通。橡皮製品亦不宜與油類接觸。　　保護　當使用橡皮製品，亦須時時注意保護之。即常使該品件清潔，不受奇寒酷熱。例如車胎之内管，旣爲裝入空氣之用，勢必裝滿空氣，否則壓力不足，因行動時之振動，毎易破裂。其外胎内層之布，若含水分，即易舊壞。毎日揩洗，固欲使其清潔，然須先裝足空氣，否則水入内層，有害橡皮之品質。油類亦爲有損橡皮之物，亦宜注意。　　保存　㈠依余個人之經騐，欲保存橡皮製品，可將橡皮製品擱置於火油之上，使常蒸受火油蒸氣，則可得很好效果。其法即先製一木桶或木橱，其下部置一淺盆，中盛火油，橡皮製品可擱置於櫉中層層之横架上。因爲火油爲揮發性液體，自能使櫉中充滿火油之蒸氣。　　㈡橡皮品之不含有金屬或布者，可浸於水中保存之。　　㈢以橡皮製件，浸於石蜡液中，熱至攝氏表一百度。能抵抗光線及火氣之作用。　　㈣若有橡皮製品之久露乾燥空氣，及其他不適宜之環境而减彈性者，可浸入三％之石炭酸溶液中，則可恢復之。魔的正反  沙文　　太陽像個慈愛的牧母，溫和地撫着這年靑人的頭部，　　怕是因爲陽光的力量，年靑人，雖然臥在床上，像還有着夢了，可是眼臉已在必必地忙着跳動，不一會竟悠悠地醒來，但是因爲驟然觸到過强的陽光的緣故，雖是已經醒了的人，還把眼睛閉上一些時間，　　以後慢慢的睜大眼來，認清了當前的境界，『！統統上課去了』，駭着，一個骨碌，跳出被窩，擦擦眼，想起夜來的酣睡，是近一個月來未有的『盛况』，笑了，　　走向盥洗室的時候，這年靑的人哼着一隻快意的洋歌，輕柔地，　　然後又從盥洗室回來，看錶，第三課還早，於是從床底拖出盛餅乾的盒子，端一杯開水，嘴是動着，心就慢慢的想起另外的一些事了，是關於他昨日以前的生活的，　　時間從某一段落起，這靑年像個上了獵人勾當的野獸，苦悶？憂鬰，掙扎，無用｜倘使想知道一些他當時生活的人，靠這樣的筆尖來告訴，不能滿意是一定的，除非他也有過獵户陷阱裏的生活經騐，然而姑且我們把他想起的事情勉强記録下來，讀者不滿意，記者當然告罪，　　話説從那時起，他夜裏固是睡不穏，即使在白天，也彷彿丢了印把子的官兒，做事短少精神，坐，立，像失去了重心的東西，找不到適當的平衡點似乎是需要一點睡眠的時間，可是被一蓋上身，精神倒抖擻起來，同時某一種固定的想念，像個猢猻，在樹頂，極頑皮地不許他入睡，換一種事情，看書，然而書對他也全是毫無意義的東西，像螞蟻排着陣，更換一種，找同學談天，然而談天的資料又老是使他苦悶的東西················　　這樣的生活方式延長到昨天，他接着他母親的信，説『看汝最近照片，何竟消瘦若是？想係功課太緊，嗣後務以身體爲重，以免縣念·····』捧着信，他突然哭了，　　哭後，他自已當做醫生，細心地診察着這病的根源，即刻病根是找到了，於是更小心地處方，這方子今天還放在桌角，上面是寫着：『春繭自縛，何苦的事！』就是靠着這小小紙條的魔力，　昨夜，他得到安眠，　　○　　　　　○　　　　　○　　離開第三課的時間，已經差不多，他隨手攫了講義，上課室去，　　在敎室裏，他恰巧又坐在一個女人的後排，那女人，正是昨日以前使他苦悶的泉源，　　然而年靑人還算不弱，儘可能的把眼望住課本，看他額上微微地滚着汗，我們可以曉得他是怎樣的在用力，可是當他偶然向黑板一望時，他看到她在偷偷的注視他，他又心慌，忙着念『莫『春繭自縛』！』，十遍，廿遍，·····，可是這法寳今天不靈了，像個受了潮的爆竹，　　年靑人雖然掙扎着，終於還是陷入憂鬰，苦笑着、</p>

<p>從自殺到復活  文炳　　誰都以爲Ｋ是不在人世了。只要由他的凌亂的房間，由他前幾日顚狂的狀態看來，便有八九分把握來下這樣的肯定。何况Ｈ還在他的書桌抽屉裏發現他這樣一個字條：　　「有些人説，環境越是險惡，越須向前奮鬥，這話，在一年以前，不但自己服膺着，而且還要用以昭誥别人。現在我才明白了，那簡直是騙人的狗屁，民族國家已是這樣的蹇厄，還要加上自己雲魂的被摧毀，呌我如何去奮鬥？不如消極的抨擊方法，雖然自己是毀滅了，但，我想毀滅自己的代價，也許能震破若干人的迷夢，所以我敢於下我的决心，敢於去實行我的主張。」　　Ｋ本是一個醒腦的靑年，在××大學唸書已是三年級了，再過一年，方帽戴在頭上，文憑握在手中，緣着父兄的政治路線，怕不能踏上民衆的頭顱，赫赫就在社會上做所謂第一流人物麽，那眞誰也不相信。然他却覺得這類的人，不但是不榮耀，而且是罪惡。自九一八禍變後，他情願犠牲自己的一切，去從事反日工作，他並不像普通人的空口呐喊，骨子裏却在想媚日的機會，甚至擁日。　　他第一摏反日的工作，是把穿着日本貨的洋服，撕成粉碎，把桌上的東洋茶杯以及其他文具，統統摔了，表示他不再用仇貨的初步决心。　　此外他想要反日，需要一個强壯身體，於是他便向軍事訓練方面努力。此外他更口頭宣傳，文字鼓吹，在在都表現着他的反日工作的緊張。　　時光像電流似的奔逝，接着又發生了一二八滬變，學校淪爲戰塲，民族到了毀滅的光頂，他想時候到了，於是他去投軍××師，師長接見他，當面是很贊賞，背地却十分懷疑，以爲學生總是危險的，不大靠得住，使他感到請纓無緣，然他爲了要貫澈爲民族戰的决心，他就投入後防義勇隊。殺，他只想向前殺敵去，那知前線全部後退了，他僅逃出一條性命。　　這果然使他受一個莫大的打擊。　　從此他將爲民族戰的熱心，漸漸移向到了女人的身上，Ｃ女士是他平日所傾心注目的，伊也有幾分注意到他。可是伊是十足虚榮的女子，他那裏夠得上，至多他只能在伊的腦中作些晃動。固然在某一個時候，他們果然很親暱，然而不多久，伊又投到了另一個人的懷裏。自然他便成了情場中的失戀者。　　這是他受的第二個大打擊。　　從此他的心更冷了，他想只有一死百了：然而他去投海，偏偏又遇了救。　　現在他又收回了他的殺敵的雄心，他想：「這那裏是我的行爲？自殺，不但是怯弱無用的表現，而且，簡直是人類的醜行！當前民族的命脈是越益危殆了，東北幾乎全部喪失了，錦州退守了，熱河平津也都到了岌岌可危的線上，我們民衆還能坐視整個民族的傾覆麽？只有，只有靠民衆的力，把民族唤轉，領土恢復，浴血鏖戰，入死出生的東北義勇軍，才是人類的忠臣，民族的救星｜去，我要去投從他們，用我的力，撲滅我們的敵人，用我的血，洗滌那海中三島！」　　自殺以後的Ｋ果然投向東北義勇軍裹去了，暴風急雨在爲他奏着勝利之曲。賣唱的小鳥  尤其　　深秋的風徐徐地吹着，雖則時節是在深秋，但是所吹的風的含質，却一些都沒有冷意。　　在愛多亞路那長蛇似的電炬的光芒下，一雙一雙的所謂「市虎」在緊啣接着由東面向西駛來、那大世界口的紅緑燈，須經過一個很相當的時間才能調轉。這時，在一般人的面容上，浮現着一種需求，這需求，很顯然的可以看得出情態的緊張。　　大的和小的飯館，他們的鍋勺很迅速的工作着，來减少一部份期待者的神態的緊張，因此，鍋與勺的敲響，跑堂的奔忙，餐客的談笑，肉香，酒氣······在不自禁的由樓頭和其他的部份迸發了出來。　　餐客陸績的佔據了飯館裹的其他的空位，同時，雜亂與奔忙也更勝過了以前，就在這時，不提防，不，沒有想到，一個年齡還不及䈂的遍塗着白粉與口紅被所謂摩登衣服緊裹着的女子跨進了某一個一丈見方的餐間。　　「要唱吧？」她開口了，隨着用她那含有诱誘惑性的眼睛向餐客們一掃。　　像羅通大殺四門般的正在起勁的好漢，受了尖鋭的呼聲的震撼，不禁的反過頭來望了幾眼。　　「不要唱」。一個人這樣説，樣子好像很討厭這不幸的攪擾，説了後，在他們的面部表情間顯然的起了一種分化的肉感，不過，因着某種的關係，不能立即的表示出什麽。　　「要唱吧，先生？」聰明的小鳥｜她即刻的體察出他們間的肉感，於是，很有把握似的移動過去立在另一個人的身旁，這樣的問。　　「你去問他吧｜他！」他先看了她一眼，然後和靄的説。　　微微地她遲疑了一霎那，又迅速的回了過去。　　「先生，哎唷，唱一齣吧！」她的聲浪是那樣的嬌媚，同時，又立刻的掏出了一個小摺子放在他的面前。　　「不，不｜｜」他的語氣不像剛才那般的堅决了。　　「哎唷，先生·····」她用他的筷子把盤裹的菜拑進他的碗裹，並且，用拳頭在他的背脊上輕輕地擂着。　　「呵！呵！好了，就唱一　×××。」終於他允許了。　　阿×，拿胡琴來。　　不久，繚繞的琴音和婉轉的聲調，飄散街心來。聚餐會  阿品　　昨天我正抰了講義急冲冲的上課去經過佈告板，偶然抬頭·「打倒一盤散沙之惡名」九個斗大還圈了紅圈的字跳進了我的眼簾。　　啊！又不知閙什麽把戯了，我納罕起來，禁不住走上去讀一讀，　　呵！原來是有幾位「小開」在微徵求參加聚餐會的同學，　　照這張通告看來，好像「打倒一盤散沙之惡名」只有「吃」才能做到｜除了「吃」以外沒有第一個辦法了，這到也是事實：用「開會」的方法來「打倒一盤散沙之惡名」的只有幾位活動份子的窮酸朋友去幹的，袋裹麥克麥克裝滿「大拉斯」的同學們以杯盤交錯中來「打倒一盤散沙之惡名」的，　　在今天我走過佈告板時，看見「贊成者請簽名於後」後的空白上，寫着：酒肉朋友，肉的團結，吃的同盟·····這顯然是幾位窮酸同學尋的開心，但裹面也有好幾位簽上尊姓大名的，這當然是預備「吃」一頓的同學了，　　外人説中國人是「吃」的民族，這話並不苛刻，我們只要看社會上一切什麽重大事情，都可以以請「吃」一頓來解决的，甚至於國家大事，如財長籌欵，發行公債等，也只須請銀行界「吃」一頓來解决的，我們的大學生是未來的中國的主人翁，社會的領導者，爲將來服務國家社會起見，也應當綀習綀習「吃」的藝術，而爲保持「吃」的民族的榮譽起見，更應該實習實習「吃」的本領了。市場訊▲申新染廠，新聞路卡德路口申新染廠、爲滬上染業界後起之秀，資本雄厚，規模宏大、選購歐美上等顏料、特聘化學專門技師、精染各種綢綾布疋呢絨嗶嘰毛織等品、色澤鮮明、洗晒不退、深得各界贊許去、▲生路第十二期出版預告、生路週刊第十二期定於二十二年一月二日出版、内容較前益形豐富、有魏中天的冬夜、吳承達的生路在那裹、周天籟的夢、朱少飛的豐年當米等文藝創作十餘篇、每册仍售銅元四枚、各報販均有代售去、店員通訊　　上夜校的權利被剝削了編者先生：　　近閲貴報載的「店員通訊」一欄，專門解答一切的疑題，引導我們工商界的靑年，踏上那光明的大道前進：使一般意志薄弱者不致誤入歧途。貴刊的創設，眞可算得工商界裹的燦爛明亮的燈塔了。　　現在我是在一家固執而奮式的商店内學業，當然不會例外，牛馬一般底操作：奴僕樣的驅使：日常的工作和生活，一切無聊到極點。不過時間一長，僞也習焉而不覺其苦，習慣已經成自然了。　　因爲個人的智識不足：營業上的需要：以及諸高級職員們的贊助，費了數次的波折：始得揷入某夜校裹的英文班第二班内肄業。該校所選的課本，倒很合我的個性，所以甚感得到興趣。勇猛研讀的成績，考試下來尙還差强人意。　　不過，我的店主是固執慣的，並且是擅長壓迫。近來更變本加厲，隨意責駡。昨日又突然命令似的厲聲説：『此後决不准你們再繼續上任何夜校的功課！』啊哟！先生！我們利用那晚上的一些餘　，求些常識。尙不蒙店主諒解，心中是何等的失落！但是爲了依賴生活的職業，也只好服從。只是我以前所修的學業，豈非半途而廢嗎？以前所用去的書學費，豈非擲於烏有嗎？我是何等的痛心！我於痛心失望之餘，歸納兩個問題，要求先生的解答：㈠倘寗願犧牲職業而繼續求學者則爲經濟所限制：㈡如忍痛而度此生活則前程黯淡毫無把握。　　　　　　　　盛福均上　　編者按：承蒙過獎，愧不敢當。我們也不過就我們所知，與讀者諸君共同探討，得一個適當解决而已。　　盛君現在的處境，確甚困難。舊式商店内之店主經理，大多固執。惟盛君之店主，起初尙能允許盛君進夜校肄業，雖然「費了數次的波折，」總算是一個開得通的人。盛君不妨利用這一點試試：請一個與店主有關係而頭腦清新的人，代爲説項，言詞務宜委婉動聽，以達到允許繼續求學之目的爲度。此是第一步。　　如果第一步的計劃難以實現，那麽，沒有别的辦法，祇好不進夜校，單在工作餘暇自己修習。好在已經有相當的成續，不至於茫無頭緖。同時多看書報：這樣雖不能與在學校裹有同樣進步，至少亦可不致「半途而廢」。一方面再多託親友，留心較好的機會。不過須注意；在店主及其他戰員面前必須嚴守秘密，切勿露出形跡；假使給店主知道了，也許立時會給你嚴重處分的。　　以上兩個計劃，盛君能依次行去，抱着十二分的毅力，不灰心，不悲觀，我們想前途是一定光明的。　　以上不過是答復盛君個人的，但是我們深信要整個的得到解放。確不是容易的事，必須共同團結起來，向社會呼籲，以期得到社會的同情心，方始談得到保障。關於這一點，我們以後再來討論，亦徵求讀者諸君的意見。小説同情者（八績）  張恨水　　王老二道：孟先生幾年不回來，難道這是個都忘了嗎？大槪總是田東一半，我們一半。孟國寳道：這就對了。你自己揷田，人工不算而外，種子，牛，糞料，犁耙水車，那一樣不是本錢？揷起田來，上面是太陽晒，下面是熱水蒸，有蟲防蟲，無水車水，一粒汗珠子，換出一粒稻米，多麽辛苦。從三月忙起，好容易忙到八九月裹，稻熟了，割了打了，一担一担的，挑到家裹，用篾圍子圈上。於是乎東家來了，帶了挑子，把圍子裹的稻子，給你挑了一半去。你苦了個夠，他風不吹，雨不灑的，分個現成。九月十月，你們也許還是光了兩條腿，赤了一雙脚，你們東家，可是長袍子，短套子，鞋襪整齊，在村子裹搖擺到鎭上，鎭上又搖擺到村子裹來，你們見了他，老早的客客氣氣呌他一聲東家老爹，他還是愛理不理的。你想，同是一個人，爲甚這樣不平等呢？王老二一隻手扶了旱烟袋，一隻手擦了臉笑道：話怎麽那樣比得，那是人家的田呀。田給我們種了，難道，就不要收租。孟國寳道：當然的！他不能收租。他要收稻，就當自己去耕田，不耕田就不能收稻，這是天下的大道理。王老二笑道；那豈不是反了？孟國寳將手按了膝蓋，微昂了頭嘆了一口氣道：像你們這樣的人，眞是忠厚得可憐。被人壓迫得慣了，有一天有不受壓迫的機會，倒以爲是要造反，這話從那裹説起？王老二道：孟先生説的也有理。可是人家的田，也是錢買的，又不是搶來的，爲什麽白給人種呢？孟國寳道：怎麽不是搶的？而且就是搶得你們的。好比你現在的東家，專靠你們這作佃户的，賣苦力和他揷田，年年坐地收租，有了稻，賣了錢，積攢得多了，就可以賣田。錢是你們佃户和他掙的，自然田也是你們佃户給他買的，你們總是苦，他就越來越發財，所以我以爲佃户給東家種的田，大可以拿了過來自種自食。他這一篇子大道理，王老二眞是聞所未聞，雖然覺得奇怪，想着想着，也有些道理。他心裹倒有幾點可研究之處，便是作田東的應當怎麽辦。然而這理由可説不出來。他正躊躇着呢，王二嫂却是噗嗤一聲的笑了出來了。王老二道：你笑什麽？王二嫂看了看孟國寳的臉色，低了頭，又低了聲音道：要是那末説，孟先生家裹那麽些個田，都給佃户收去了，到那兒去收租哇？孟國寳倒不考慮，挺了胸，就答復着道：自然都讓佃户拿了去。王二嫂笑道：要是那樣辦，孟先生可就沒有錢花了。王老二笑道：是呀！孟先生在省裹讀書，那個月不由家裹解一筆欵子去，那欵子呢，説起來，也是我們佃户的了。孟國寳一番好意，和王老二表示無限的同情，大大的和他説話。不料他不但未能了解，倒反駁一句，自己正是坐地分財的人，這可怎樣去答覆人家？</p>

<p>電影專刊影界珍聞蠻女天堂瑣話（續前日）  白　　　　Ｔhe　Bird　of　Paradise　　　㈢劇情的根據及神話　　「蠻女天堂」所叙述的，可以説是未開化民族的一種宗敎的恐怖，在夏威夷，未開化的境界裹，兩性可以公開的選擇他的配偶。於「愛攸亞」（Ｔua即土人的擇偶大舞會）舉行的時候，成年的女性，站於少男們圍繞的圈子裹，在融融的火光中鼕鼕的鼓聲裹，震聲價響的唱着求歡之歌，扭着草裙之舞（Hula-Hula）。在這擁抱按捺的狀態下，她們的眉目是橋慵得發光而紅潤的。她們舞向各個愛慕的少男，盤旋着，扭嬝着，直至他的熱情已沸儯到了焦點，立起來擁着她到深密無人的森林中，去溫存着對手。　　然而，擇偶公開的土人，却在兩性的中間縣着嚴酷的「交接禁例」，尤其對女性爲難。　　假使，信服這種禁例而世代不替，土人們當然自慰着，因爲他們沒有觸怒了神明，火山可以不爆發，一切的建設可以不燬滅。反之，這「衆矢之的」的罪魁禍首，便在魔法師（Tom　toms）的指揮下，非跳入火山的噴口，作爲祭品，不足以贖整個種族的罪戾。　　夏威夷原是一清雅幽美的去處，幾勞成埃火山（Kilauea）矗立天際，高一萬三千六百七十五尺。當爆發時，鎔石便滾滾而下，遍地沸騰：聲浪是哄哄震耳：地面是搖搖欲傾：海嘯了·地裂了，恐怖充滿了整個鳥嶼。基勞威埃火山的最高峯是漢拉門門（Halamanman）火口，當地有許多關於這火山口的神話，最普遍的是説：這山口是「萬火之宫」，火山女神潘爾（Pele）的府邸。　　㈣攝製的經過及其他　　攝製上·「蠻女天堂」是侈奢的，眞實的。整實的。整個夏威夷的村落給金維多導演租赁了攝影。　　在這村落中，桃樂絲德里奥和五十個夏威夷的美貌姑娘，穿了顯露着豐潤的肉體的草裙，掛着鮮花結成的圈子，微微掩飾她們的前胸，而跳着求偶的舞蹈：數千個土人充當着演員；百餘隻小艇，參與着一次送殯。　　幾幕極難得的鏡頭，是不能不加以褒揚的。最重要的是海嘯。海水在奔騰而急　湍，佐麥克利游泳於這向海底急轉直下的湍流中。這是他生命與死亡的抗鬥，雖然，在四周佈滿着精於水性的土人，以防萬一。　　佐麥克利不僅表演此一幕水中技術，還在海底和一條大海鼈鬥戰，這海鼈是有三百十磅重。　　談到水，又想起了桃樂絲，想起她在水底裹浴的光景，美而健的體格在淺澹的水中，隠約可見；以及她登岸奪布蔽體的嬌羞不勝，和初嘗甜吻的痴戀無忌：以及她···　　講愛的表示，麻醉的誘力，不拘形跡，不受禮敎的拘束，任性地，隨意地發揮兩性的追求與需要，姚樂絲的確能毫無顧忌的發揮在片中。桃樂絲德里奥佐麥克利合演充滿了南海風味的「蠻女天堂」中最熱烈的一幕　　公開書啓，伯英君鑒：本刊所載照片，均不給酬。閣下如有佳照，願割愛投寄者，無任歡迎。小馬君鑒：來稿不登載者恕不能一一作覆；如欲知不登載的理由，大槪係篇幅不夠的原故吧。　　　　編者白觀衆意見評「東北二女子」  吉仲　　天一公司以九一八與一二八二次事變作背境之「戰地二孤女」，宣傳以來，將及期年。但卒因南京電檢會及租界當局之多方留難，始終未得公映。最近因公司當局之竭力疏通，遂得以「東北二女子」之相見於觀衆之前矣。今將管見所及，遂一評之。㈠劇旨方面｜劇旨是很有意識的，牠能給我們一個强有力的剌激，以九一八與一二八之事變作背境，搖旗呐喊，很能夠挽回人民已死的良心。租界當局之所以留難頻加，正爲着牠富有民族色彩，所以將劇旨方面來講，的確是我們危亡的民族所絶對的需要。㈡導演方面｜導演是李萍倩，現在他已脱離天一了。在這部裹，我們可以明白的黨示，就是他的確已能夠貢獻他的聰明。如佈局的靈活，分幕的緊凑，尤其是那幾句對白，如某傷兵已傷去了左手，但是他説還有右去可以去放鎗，再如招募義勇軍一段，孫敏所飾的演説者，大聲疾呼的喊着「不做亡國奴的，快些去殺敵吧。」···諸如此類，不勝枚舉。無疑地觀衆們在不知不覺中，飽受了無數的興奮劑。㈢演員方面｜胡珊的表情，較在「一夜豪華」裹，已進步不少，在修書給意想中情人的時候，那一付含情脈脈，眞虧她描寫得出新進的陸麗霞亦很稱職，在病房裹痛述過去情景，那一種不勝抑鬱的情調，很能合格。馬陋芬覺得呆木些。全片並沒有怎樣令有滿意的表演㈣雜説幾句｜幾幕戰爭的怖景很好。肉搏的數幕，也很逼眞，不過飛機沒有聲音，却是個絶大的缺點。街道的佈景，非常簡陋，臨時醫院，只有病人六個，也太失眞。光線還清晰。收音不甚講究，以阿貴僕役穿揷其間，尙覺討人歡喜。但當他同小姐至旅館裹的時候，忽然穿了西服，在情理上又太覺當戲做好萊塢綁案多  紫因　　明星們闊是闊了，但是心裹對於一切不熱悉的來訪者，都含着恐懼。他們的臉貌行動，旣爲大衆所熟悉，他們的住宅，也是隠秘不住。綁匪要想法起來，機會也正多呢。並且一般已做了母親的明星，鑒於林白之子的綁案悲慘的結局，更是提心吊胆，不得不妥爲防備了。明星們很多僱用了包鏢，日夜追隨他們的左右，並圍護他們的住宅。來客良莠不齊，難以區别，索性一槪謝絶。他們更爲愼重起見，汽車夫也往往是半包鏢的。譬如瑙瑪希拉的汽車夫，和一位平常服裝的包鏢，永遠把尖鋭的眼光，注射在希拉那個小實實身上，就是一個最好的例。影星韻聞張織雲與阮玲玉  銀絲　　　　　　　｜一幕邂逅的趣劇｜　　影星張織雲女士，和茶商唐季珊君。他們夫婦倆的愛情上，確已發生了巨大的裂痕。早就勞燕分飛，各不相問。張女士擅長交際，朋友甚多。近來，她於許多異性友好中，和一位呌做小滕的，出入相偕，遊樂與共。比較的，最爲親密。　　前天晚上。他們同到辣斐花園跳舞塲跳舞去。兩下在燈光掩映，舞影婆娑，悠揚而怡蕩的音樂狂奏聲中。並坐品茗，娓娓清談。等到一曲旣罷，電燭齊輝。一變變舞侣們紛紛挽臂，各回原座時。張女士驀地發現意外的奇遇。觸目凝視着緊鄰座上一對情侣。　　在這一刹那間。空氣緊張，逹於極點。接着，不期而然的大家立了起來。點頭，微笑，｜不自然的微笑。　　『我來給你們介紹一下罷！這一位是我的Wife張織雲女士。這一位是我的朋友阮玲玉女士！』唐季珊笑着爲他的舞伴阮女士的張女士介紹。　　『我也來和你們介紹｜這一位是我的Ｈusband唐季珊先生。這一位是我的朋友小滕先生！』張女士含笑説着，聲音很是低微。　　雙方都介紹過了。大家連聲哈哈，笑了一陣。表示非常愉快。　　這一幕兩大女星驀地邂逅的短劇。表演深刻，精采動人。只可惜當時沒有攝入「開末拉」中，來供給大衆們的欣賞。末未免終是一件憾事。　　意見貢獻影戲場的空氣問題  小歐陽　　一羣人們，納在一座四面不通風的電影場中，坐了二三小時，然後才散了出去。可是在事實上，電影場每天是連接的要開映，那麽全場之内，可算不斷地人許多人們在呼吸着。而電影場的空氣問題，不能不認爲很重要很　研究的一件大事了！　　第一，那容量問題，我們不得不打量賣座若干，平均每人須呼吸若干容積？（在某時間内）然後依科學上的方法，測出必須的至少的電影場的容積，或即就電影場的容量，限定只許若干觀衆！　　　第二，換氣問題，這就是如何引入新鮮空氣，排出惡濁空氣（炭養等），這就是在外國已早有了設置，像抽氣換氣，皆有進一步的研究。　　第三，如何設法改造空氣的惡濁？這對禁止吸烟及吃雜食，與夫咳嗽吐痰，是得要緊的一個意義。　　事實上在上海各戯院，似乎很少存這關於空氣的設置，（國泰南京光陸等戯略有一二）。並且劇場的不合理，幽暗神似山谷，小販隨意賣物，隨意吐痰，隨意抽烟，種種不道德舉動，令人作嘔，在外國這幾點的（電影衛生），政府是注意審查的，並且認爲很重要的問題，我很望我國各電影院，也來好好整頓一下子才行！電影專著「阿呀！救命吓！」  陳大悲　　用聲音帮助表情的獨習注仍以轉變遲緩爲最須注重之點。因爲突然做像某一種表情，在尋常未經訓綀的人都無一不能當鏡一試。至若進漸退隨心所欲，以及隨時可以將某一種表情一絲不走的保留至若干秒鐘，則非久經訓綀不可。如果絶對的未經訓綀，而能將任何一種表情一絲不走的保留至一分鐘以上，絶不至噴飯樣的笑出來，這個有眞是我所久欲尋覓而從未見到的天才。　　老實説，我在學得獨習的方法勤苦修綀之前，我對於表情是一無所能的。雖然我也常常對着鏡子偶爾模仿這樣那樣的表情，但是當着大衆，我就面紅耳赤的不好意思表演出來。所以我確信表演藝術是非勤苦修綀不能成功的。　　第十一式表情獨習法和第三式相彷。不過第三式用深呼吸的方法來綀習的。這第十一式却需要聲音的帮助。　　學者對鏡中眉心間先作極度的怒容，然後將緊張的筋肉逐漸鬆弛下來，目光變成非常的驚訝。　　先看看這種表情已做到如何程度。然後用力呼出『阿呀！救命吓！』的聲音來。你再細察這種表情又加深到如何程度。然後逐漸將這種表情退去，髣髴已經察出自已的錯誤，原來使你受驚的不過是一種幻象而已。</p>

<h3>Japanese Actively Planning to Invade Jehol</h3>
<p>Concentrating Forces on the Pseudo-Fengshan and Jin-Chao Lines, Attempting to First Occupy Northern Jehol and Organize a Mongolian Government</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese are quite active in invading Jehol. It is heard that Japan has decided to use the forces of the 14th, 8th, and 63rd Divisions as the main force for attacking Jehol. The 14th Division is concentrated in Tongliao, the 8th Division is concentrated on the Jin-Chao line, and the entire 6th Division is concentrated in Suizhong. The pseudo-troops Cheng Guorui and Li Jichun, with more than 20,000 men in the front lines of Chaoyangsi and other places, are supplied with uniforms and bullets by the Japanese. Koiso personally inspected them in Chaoyangsi a few days ago. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in Kailu area of Jehol is complicated. The volunteer armies are all concentrating towards Tongliao. The Japanese army is busy transporting in Tongliao, and another regiment has been added to the area. In Fuxin and other counties on the Jehol border, a large number of Mongolians are recruiting bandits, under the instigation of the Japanese. The Japanese are attempting to first occupy several counties in northern Jehol and organize a Mongolian government. Our countrymen should pay urgent attention. There are many traitors on the Jehol border, and there are even more ignorant people in the counties of Fuxin who are being incited by the Japanese to resist paying taxes, creating an even greater crisis. Feng Zhanhai's troops, numbering more than 20,000 men, are now replenishing their military supplies in Jianping, Suidong, Kailu and other areas. Once completed, they will set out to kill the enemy. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army's plan to attack my Jehol is becoming more and more obvious recently. They are actively buying off the remnants of the Zhili-Shandong armies in Peiping and Tianjin, numbering about 150,000 men, and organizing them into a pseudo-construction army, divided into five corps. The Japanese army is providing them with military expenses, bullets, and firearms, using them as the vanguard to disturb Jehol. Chief of Staff Koiso went to Jinzhou, and held a military meeting at the headquarters of the 8th Division on the 26th. Commander Mutō ordered all divisions and brigades to concentrate their forces on the Jin-Chao Road and the pseudo-Fengshan Road. Armored vehicles, tanks, airplanes, mountain guns, heavy guns, and various other military supplies are being successively transported to Chaoyangsi. The Japanese army in Tongliao has also been ordered to be transferred to Chaoyang. Airplanes are bombing towns and villages on the Jehol border in formations every day, and countless innocent farmers are dying under the bombs. The Japanese and puppet troops concentrated on the Jin-Chao and pseudo-Fengshan lines total more than 100,000 men, which shows that the situation on the Jehol border is in a critical state. (China United Press dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Tang Cables Stating Intensified Defense</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin cabled Ping today, saying that there were no changes in Jehol Province, and that all counties had intensified their defenses. The bombing of Fulingnan County by Japanese aircraft was not true; however, Japanese aircraft often flew there for reconnaissance. Japanese troops were gathering on the Jehol border, but had not yet clashed with our regular army. Furthermore, a telegram from Chengde stated that the 5th Regiment of the 8th Division of the Japanese Army attacked volunteer forces in the Shiguizi area on the 25th, and used Cheng Guorui and others to harass villages near Yaowangmiao in the Zhonglingnan San District. The Lingnan defense team is maintained by local militias. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Koiso's Address to Suzuki Brigade</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army has recently concentrated three divisions on the Jehol border, namely the 5th, 8th, and 9th Divisions, with a total of more than 50,000 men. Koiso, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, addressed the Suzuki Brigade in Chaoyang on the 26th, saying in brief that the previous Hanjō policy of governing Manchuria was entirely based on hegemony, which aroused the indignation of the Manchurian people, and volunteer armies rose up like silkworms, making it difficult to eliminate them. Now, Commander Mutō is governing Manchuria with benevolence and implementing a policy of appeasement. It is expected that Manchuria will be filled with obedient people, and the volunteer armies will be eliminated through recruitment, etc. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bombing Koubei Yingzi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army has been sending planes to bomb Nanling, Koubei Yingzi, and other places for several days. One fighter plane was shot down by the volunteer army. Our army has built extremely solid positions in Chaoyang and other places, making it difficult for the Japanese army to attack. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Set Deadline for Recruiting Pseudo-Troops</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Commander Mutō of the Kwantung Army plans to organize sixteen mixed brigades in the Northeast before April next year, with Chinese and Japanese officers serving as commanders. People like Cheng Guorui, Fang Yongchang, Li Jichun, and Yang Ziqing are all within these sixteen mixed brigades. All soldiers are entirely recruited from our people. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Building Motor Roads on Jehol Border</h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) The Yuguan area has been calm recently, and the people's hearts are more stable than they were ten days ago. There are currently no confirmed reports on the Japanese activities on the Jehol border. Xintai Gate in Cheng County and Jiangjiatun in Jinxi County, which border Jehol, are both building roads to prepare for stationing troops. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Guogui talked about being unable to sleep for several nights due to the tension in Yuguan, leading to anemia and neurasthenia. Now that Yuguan has eased, there are dozens of pseudo-police at the station, and several hundred Japanese troops have been transferred from Tianjin. Britain, France, and Italy each have dozens of troops stationed there, and there are also American troops stationed on Qindao. He swore to defend the country to the death, and everything must be in accordance with the orders of his superiors. His visit to Peiping was to recuperate, and he would return to his post as soon as he recovered. After the failure of the volunteer army outside the Guan, bandits rose up in droves, and the villagers gathered in the county seat in great fear. He sincerely hoped that the country would recover the lost territories as soon as possible. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Incitement of Volunteer Army Ineffective</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A Japanese man from Wang Yunping's volunteer army delivered a letter from the Xindian Sanjian Zhenbu Brigade of the Kwantung Army Command a few days ago. The original letter roughly stated: "The general trend of China is over, and the state of Manchuria is about to be pacified. In the past, we were concerned about Su Bingwen's troops in the Northwest and Rehe in the Southwest. Now, the Northwest Army has been resolved by us, and Rehe will also be pacified within the next two months. We hope that you will observe the general trend of the country and surrender to Manchuria as soon as possible, and you will definitely be treated with preferential treatment, etc." The unit believed that his words were absurd and that he was plotting to lure them, so they executed the Japanese man who delivered the message. Recently, planes have repeatedly scattered leaflets in the Fuxin area, but the people have ignored them. The Japanese, realizing that this was ineffective, used large quantities of Japanese copper coins to tie the leaflets together and scatter them, in order to seek welcome and acceptance from the villagers. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Use Heavy Money to Induce Card-Playing Civilians in Jehol</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Jehol said that the Japanese military group was in a hurry to get to Jehol. Recently, they used heavy money to induce card-playing civilians in eastern Jehol, and made them make flags and exempt them from donations, and changed the large car road from Beikouzi to Chaoyangsi into a motor road. Also, the Japanese army in Jin County was mobilized very frequently, with an increase in the situation, it was said. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army's Increase in the Datong Line</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army has increased its troops by more than 3,000 in Xinlitun on the Datong Line, stationed to the left and right of the area. There were originally more than 500 Japanese troops stationed in the area, all under the command of Koiso. The plan is to first eliminate Wang Yunping's volunteer army, and then advance towards Fuxin. The Japanese are also supervising many workers, starting from Zhangwu and repairing the motor road directly to Fuxin, in order to facilitate the transportation of invading Jehol. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Japan Claims Not to Desire Major War Recently</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although there have been various alarming news reports regarding the overall situation in Jehol recently, the Japanese Ministry of the Army remains remarkably calm, stating that as far as Japan is concerned, it does not want to engage in a major war in the near future. The Ministry of the Army recently received information stating that Zhang Xueliang recently transferred three brigades of troops into Jehol, two brigades stationed near Shanhaiguan, and one brigade stationed north of Beiping. However, the Japanese military authorities, while closely monitoring possible developments, do not pay much attention to this information. Furthermore, according to a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Army, the old troops of Su Bingwen are trying to go south to join other volunteer armies, but many have been intercepted, and the rest are exhausted from cold and hunger. The Japanese military authorities still hope that the Jehol issue can be resolved peacefully, but they regret that Tang Yulin has become increasingly stubborn recently, so they fear that war will become unavoidable before the start of the two seasons in June next year. The spokesperson also confirmed the rumors that the Japanese military authorities intend to increase their military strength in Manchuria, saying that they plan to increase the number of troops stationed in Manchuria to 60,000 or 65,000 within the next two years, and at the same time improve the weapons of the Manchurian garrison and re-equip them. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Receives Reports from the Front</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Military Affairs Commission has been receiving reports from the front about the Japanese army's coveting of Jehol for several days. The Beiping Military Branch has also sent several telegrams to the capital. As for how our side is preparing for defense, the telegrams have been forwarded to Chairman Chiang for instructions. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Government Has Made Its Decision</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain member of the Central Committee said that the Jehol issue has become serious due to the Japanese army's advance. The government has made its decision to resist by force and is preparing. The continued expansion of Japan's aggressive actions not only endangers China, but also threatens the Soviet Union, the United States, and other countries that uphold peace. In other words, it is making a more blatant challenge to world justice and peace. Japan believes that this kind of action is beneficial to them, but dares to predict that the result will be the opposite. Before the eighteenth century, this kind of action might have succeeded, but after the eighteenth century, all imperialistic acts that violate humanity and justice will inevitably fail and be destroyed. History has shown this without the slightest error. The Russian Empire and Germany during the European War are willing witnesses. Regarding the arrival of violence, we cannot just make superficial and furious jumps, nor can we indifferently ignore it and wait for its natural progress. We must prepare for the actual revenge under the indignation of the enemy's situation. The government should do so, and the people should do so even more. Otherwise, if we only seek superficial clamor, without seeking truth from facts, or are even more courageous in internal strife and selfish attempts, then the loss of the eastern provinces is irreparable, and the great cause of national revival will never have hope.

<h3>Zhangjia Arrived in Ping Last Night</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjia arrived in Ping tonight and will set up the Xuanhua Envoy's Office in Songzhu Temple. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Zhangjia passed through Jinan this morning on his way to Ping. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Hosts a Banquet for Various Generals</h3>
<p>Han Fuju's special train back to Jinan is ready</p>
<p>Ma Hongkui arrived in Ping and will transfer to Ningxia</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang, due to the rumors circulating outside about the Jehol border in recent days that are not entirely true, plans to invite the press in the next few days to report everything. Zhang hosted a banquet for Han Fuju and Ma Hongkui at the Shuncheng Wangfu tonight, and invited Jiang Bocheng, Wan Fulin, Song Zheyuan, etc. to accompany them. Han is scheduled to return to Jinan tonight or tomorrow morning, and a special train is ready. The issue of the troops stationed in Yantai and Longkou is still under discussion between the two sides, and a concrete decision has not yet been made. Shen Honglie is scheduled to leave Ping for Tanggu tomorrow night, take the Zhenhai warship to Changshan Island to inspect the deployment of the Second Fleet of the army, then transfer to Weihaiwei to inspect the Naval Academy, and then return to Qingdao. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui arrived in Ping from the capital this afternoon, bringing more than 200 entourages and guards. Zhang's representatives, Wan Fulin, Jiang Bocheng, Wang Shuchang, and others, all welcomed him at the station. Secretary-General Feng Yanzhu of Ma said that Ma was suffering from stomach illness and had a doctor to care for him along the way. He came to the capital this time to say goodbye to Chiang, and will leave Ping in two weeks to take up the post of chairman in Ningxia. The heads of various departments will be announced after arriving in Ningxia. The troops transferred to Ningxia this time are the two mixed brigades of Ma Baolin and Lu Zhongliang, who departed from Xinyang on the 28th and will be concentrated in Baotou before January 15. Ma will take over the post of commander of the Seventh Division from Ma Hongbin in Ningxia, while Ma Hongbin will go to Xinyang to take over the post of commander of the Thirty-Fifth Division, still under the command of the Fifteenth Route Army, stationed in Xinyang to suppress bandits. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhu Qinglan visited Han Fuju this afternoon and discussed the situation on the Jehol border for about half an hour. Guo Chuntao then visited Han, spoke briefly, and left. Han is scheduled to leave Ping and return to Jinan late this afternoon, and his luggage has been transported into the special train. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuju said that the rumors about the three measures for Feng's residence were to give Feng a nominal position and provide funds for investigation or return to Beijing to work. The Central Government may have had this intention, because Chiang had expressed his hope that Feng would return to Beijing to jointly maintain the country. However, Feng has not yet expressed his opinion on these two measures. Song Zheyuan may return to take charge of the government due to unanimous retention from all parties. Regarding the tension in Jehol, only seen in the newspapers, someone mentioned it at the Political Committee meeting yesterday. The Central Government and Zhang, along with the Jehol authorities, have expressed their determination to resist if the enemy invades. The generals in Ping are all very enthusiastic about their responsibility to defend the territory. This time, they will never allow the loss of territory to be taken lightly. After the withdrawal of Liu's army from Jiaodong, the local police and militia can maintain order. There are usually one or two warships stationed there, and the Marine Corps can land at any time to assist in maintaining security. (The Central Government and Zhang Shen have repeatedly urged the provincial army to take over the defense, but the provincial government believes that local order can be maintained and there is no need to send troops again.) (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yang Aiyuan said that Yan has the determination to resist Japan. He will return to Jin on the 28th to visit Yan and report on his journey south. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying said that he came to Ping to treat his leg disease. He has reported the defenses of his army to Zhang and will return to Tangshan within the next few days, abolishing the old custom of returning to the defense before the New Year. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The generals of North China will hold a meeting at the Shuncheng Wangfu tonight to make final discussions on the issue of Feng's residence and the security of North China.</p>

<h3>Xiuyan is Surrounded</h3>
<p>Volunteer Army Units Seeking to Coordinate Attacks</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in the Former Location Set Fire to Burn Down Civilian Houses</p>
<p>(Beiping) On December 16, the pseudo-armies attacked Xiuyan in five routes, namely from Zhuanghe, Liaoyang, Dashiqiao, Haicheng, and Gushan. The Liaoyang route, led by pseudo-county magistrate Yang Xianqing with more than 500 pseudo-army Datong troops, was repelled midway by Liu Jingwen's troops, and more than 300 guns were seized. There is a saying that the pseudo-county magistrate died in battle. The Zhuanghe route was repelled by Zhang's regiment of Liu Jingwen's troops. The Gushan route was repelled by Deng Tiemei's troops. The Dashiqiao and Haicheng routes reached Xiuyan County on the 19th. Liu Jingwen's troops withdrew automatically and lurked around, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. On the 23rd, Liu's army launched an ambush, fiercely attacking the county. The Japanese and pseudo-coalition forces in the city were divided into two routes, north and south, to defend the city. The south route reached Dongtucheng and was surrounded by Deng Tiemei's troops. Five Japanese planes were shot down and two cannons were captured. The north route traveled to Gongdonggou and was repelled by Liu Jingwen, capturing 11 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese and puppet troops suffered countless casualties and huge losses.

When the Japanese army returned to the former location that evening, they passed Ningzigou and vented their anger on the farmers, setting fire to more than 20 civilian houses. The Japanese army recently convened a meeting of village chiefs in the former location, requesting that all men under the age of 30 in each village help out before and after the New Year. The villagers, hearing this news, did not know its purpose and were extremely panicked. Many fled to the interior. On the evening of the 22nd, the Japanese army in Yuguan investigated the population, household registration, and number of vehicles and horses in Shizhuang, south of the railway, claiming that men under the age of 30 were qualified to apply and ordered them to prepare vehicles and horses. After the investigation, no one was allowed to pull away without permission. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Methods for Sorting Out Sichuan Affairs</h3>
<p>Chairman of the Reorganization Committee, Zhang Qun, Plans Not to Resign Anymore</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun's position as chairman of the Sichuan Affairs Reorganization Committee, after being urged by Chairman Chiang, has been decided not to be resigned anymore. As for the standards for the selection of committee members, the list is currently under consideration. As soon as the consent of all parties is obtained, the appointments will be made and reported. It is true that Liu Wenhui's transfer to the chairmanship of Xikang and the transfer of several counties to Xikang have been discussed, but no final decision has been made. In the future, the breaking of the defense zone system will be conditional on the quota of troops of the military leaders, which is the prerequisite. Once the quota of troops is determined, the amount of salaries and supplies required each year can be budgeted, and then the total income of Sichuan Province will be used as a percentage to allocate military and administrative expenses. After this, it is not allowed to expand the troops privately. During this reorganization period, the chairman of the reorganization committee will temporarily reside in Sichuan to supervise. The reorganization committee will be disbanded only after politics is brought back on track. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Is Ma Zhanshan in Tomsk?</p>
<p>| A Bizarre Report from the Russian Side |</p>
<p>Reportedly Found Among Su Bingwen's Subordinates</p>
<p>Russian Authorities Have Isolated Him and Others</p>
<p>(Moscow) The whereabouts of Ma Zhanshan, the leader of the Heilongjiang volunteer army who fought bravely against the Japanese army in Nenjiang, had been a mystery. Now, he has suddenly been discovered among the subordinates of General Su Bingwen, who retreated into Soviet territory. General Ma reportedly retreated into Soviet territory with General Su Bingwen on December 5th. This was reported in a telegram from Tomsk, stating that on December 23rd, Soviet guards inspected Su Bingwen's soldiers staying there and found a person carrying documents. The person initially claimed to be named Ma Su Fang, but later stated that he was General Ma Zhanshan. He had concealed his name during the initial inspection, so he was not discovered. The Soviet military authorities stationed in Tomsk have isolated General Ma from others because he had deceived them. (28th TASS News Agency)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Everyone knows that General Ma Zhanshan is currently in northern Manchuria, but there is a bizarre report from Russian sources in Moscow. It is said that General Ma has appeared in Tomsk. When Russian officials inspected the Su Bingwen soldiers' accommodation center, a person claimed to be General Ma. He also said that he did not reveal his real name during the first inspection after the Soviet army fled into Russian territory. During the initial inspection, this person produced documents bearing the name [Ma Fan] (transliteration). Russian officials, believing that this person had deceived the Russian authorities, have detained him separately as a punishment. This news makes people more convinced that there are several imposters claiming to be General Ma. Some also say that this person claiming to be General Ma is just someone who wants to show off. (28th Reuters News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) People from Heilongjiang say that Ma Zhanshan has more than 40,000 men in the Keshan and Taian area and is actively resisting Japan. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>National Goods Year</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Recently, the industrial circles in Shanghai, seeing the decline of national goods and the market flooded with foreign goods, the country becoming poor and the situation deteriorating, and the social economy declining day by day like a river flowing downwards, are alarmed. They have decided to designate the 22nd year of the Republic of China as the National Goods Year and plan to use the power of all the people of the country to carry out a long-term, planned national goods movement within this year. This great undertaking is so significant that it deserves our special and serious attention.</p>
<p>Our country is a country with backward production. Even today, it is still stuck in the category of an agricultural economy. In addition, tariff sovereignty has fallen by the wayside and internal affairs are not on track. The protection of industry has been completely dismantled. The huge tide of international economic aggression is rushing in at a rapid pace. The self-sufficient agricultural economic society has long been fundamentally shaken by this huge tide and will gradually decline and perish. As a result, an independent and free country has been transformed into a world market. The economic power of advanced industrial countries roams freely, taking whatever they want, sucking the marrow and draining the blood. Looking at China's foreign trade over the years, there has been a large trade deficit every year, and it has been increasing month by month without stopping. All of this is the blood and sweat of all our people. The past was like this, and the future will be difficult. Looking ahead, how can we not be disheartened?</p>
<p>Therefore, today, if we do not want to extricate ourselves from the abyss of colonialism, then promoting national goods is an urgent and indispensable plan. However, we believe that the promotion of national goods should start with the middle and upper classes. Nowadays, most of those who consume foreign goods are middle and upper-class people. The general working farmers and workers mostly use national goods, and there is no need for us to promote them. Moreover, the promotion of national goods cannot be achieved by empty words. There must be high-quality national products that can replace foreign goods, and their prices must not be higher than foreign goods. Then everyone will be happy to use national goods. Therefore, in our opinion, the promotion of national goods must be followed by invigorating and strengthening industry, so that there are considerable production institutions in the country to meet the needs of the people. Then foreign goods will fall without being suppressed, and national goods will become popular without being promoted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is an even more important prerequisite: if the political situation is not clear and the society is not stable, then nothing can be developed. If soldiers and bandits run rampant and transportation is difficult, even if there is production, it will be impossible to sell it quickly. Heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies oppress heavily. Even if there are cheap goods, their prices will inevitably increase due to the increase in taxes, making them unable to compete with foreign goods. All of these are obvious facts before our eyes. Ignoring this and planning for other things is just dealing with the branches. This is what we must especially and solemnly remind you of at the beginning of the Shanghai industrial circles' launch of the National Goods Year.</p>
<p>Countrymen, what day is today? Is it still a day of deep drunken dreams? Those with aspirations should wield their weapons and gallop on the battlefield. Secondly, they should also be determined to fulfill their due responsibilities in their locality and devote themselves to all national salvation undertakings. Rise up and invigorate national goods. Do not be slaves to foreign goods, so as to leave a glimmer of hope for our nation. As the National Goods Year is about to begin, we sincerely hope that all the people of the country will rise up together and work together to promote national goods and develop industry, so that our country will not long remain a world market and will never recover.</p>
<h3>Two Notes from Our Delegation to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>One Proposes Amendments to the Draft Resolution of the Committee of Nineteen</p>
<p>One Rebuts the Aide-Mémoire and Declaration of the Japanese Delegation</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation recently sent two formal notes to the secretariat of the League of Nations. The first note contains the amendments proposed by the Chinese government to the draft resolution of the Committee of Nineteen. The second note contains China's comments on the Japanese delegation's aide-mémoire of December 28 and the Japanese representative's declaration at the extraordinary meeting from December 6 to 8. The Chinese delegation stated that Japan assumes the responsibility of defending against the Red Peril of Soviet Russia. From the declaration of the Japanese representative, it can be seen that Japan is indeed very afraid of the expansion of Soviet Russian communism. However, the Chinese note vigorously proves that Japan's fear is false. When China was using all its military and financial resources to suppress the Red Peril in the Yangtze River Basin, Japan invaded Manchuria at that time. This is an example. The Chinese note also explained the contradictions in the Japanese representative's declaration. On the one hand, it mentioned "the threat of the Red Peril," and on the other hand, it implied "a Japanese-Russian alliance." It is clear that Japan wants to use a kind of pretentious policy to alarm the General Assembly. What Japan hopes is to shock the world so that it can achieve its goals, but it itself knows that it is failing its formal promises. Japan said that after the Russo-Japanese War, it returned Manchuria to China. Regarding this matter, the Chinese note declares that Japan requested that US President Roosevelt mediate so that it could begin peace talks with Russia. From April 1905, Roosevelt expressed the hope that Japan would agree to the open door in Manchuria and allow the return of Manchuria to China. Both of these principles were accepted by Japan at that time. Therefore, negotiations for the Treaty of Portsmouth began in June 1905 and were soon signed. The treaty, at least regarding the territory of Manchuria, was based on the above-mentioned two principles. The US government's note of January 7, 1932, stated that the country has decided to follow its policy of 28 years ago on the Manchurian issue. A Japanese advisor of Zhang Xueliang previously advised Zhang Xueliang not to submit to the central government. The purpose was to obstruct the unification of the Chinese government. Later, the Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke explained that the advisor gave the advice according to Zhang's wishes. Regarding this, the Chinese representative Xiang Zhang Xueliang inquired. Now, Zhang Xueliang replied, "If Japan really considered my wishes when giving this advice, why did Japan oppose me on other issues? The details of Japan's interference in the internal affairs of the Eastern Provinces at that time were well known to the foreign diplomatic corps in China. If other evidence must be presented, I have various documents that can be used as evidence. If it is said that I originally did not want to change the flag, then why did I urgently implement the change of flag and not hesitate when I had the power at that time?"

<p>Yan Huiqing's Trip to Russia is Still Pending</p>
<h3>Continuing to Serve as Chief Representative Attending the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan's credentials will be submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Chairman of the National Government for signature, and then mailed to Geneva. After reaching a proper agreement with the Soviet Russian government, Yan will go to Moscow during the League of Nations recess to take up his new post and present his credentials. Regarding the rumored non-aggression treaty, it is heard that both parties had a basic draft treaty when exchanging the texts of the resumption of diplomatic relations. After detailed rules are agreed upon, it can be signed. As for the Sino-Russian commercial treaty and the China Eastern Railway issue, it has not yet been decided whether the negotiations will be conducted in Nanjing or Moscow. However, the preliminary consultations on the above issues will still be undertaken by Mo Dehui. As for when Yan will go to Russia, it depends on when both parties complete their arrangements, perhaps at the end of January. Our country's chief representative attending the League of Nations will still be Yan. The government does not intend to change people. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is actively selecting consular personnel stationed in Russia, and appointments will be made around the time Yan arrives. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) For the position of Minister to the United States, the government will once again propose Shi Zhaoji, and will telegraph the US government to seek agreement. After the reply arrives, he will be appointed. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Military Department's statistics show that the number of horses in the country has decreased from several million to less than one million in the past 20 years.

<h3>Inspecting the Judicial Process in Zhejiang and Fujian</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Vice Minister of Justice, Zheng Tianxi, went to Zhejiang and Fujian to inspect the judiciary and returned to Nanjing on the 27th. According to Zheng's statement to reporters on the 28th, he inspected the judiciary in Hangzhou, Jinhua, Yiwu, Zhuji, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and other places, lasting one month and thirteen days. The scope of the inspection included courts at both levels, administrative prisons, judicial income, and trial litigation execution, with particular emphasis on three items: personnel, economy, and system, and whether the new legal system is compatible with the actual environment. The impression of the judicial situation in the two provinces is still good. Zhejiang Province's performance is slightly inferior to Fujian's, but due to economic difficulties, the setting is difficult to complete. The general establishment of prison factories is urgent. As for changing fines to concurrent punishments, general judges believe that it is better to restore fines for minor cases. Zheng will prepare a detailed report and submit it to the ministry for reference, and will inspect the judiciary in Ningbo and Jiangsu after the New Year. (28th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>The Field of Forensic Medicine Studies Acupuncture</p>
<p>▲Havas Agency, Paris, November – Some people in the medical community here are currently studying the "acupuncture" method passed down through generations in Chinese medicine. Westerners have always considered themselves advanced in scientific progress, but now they are humbly and diligently devoting themselves to the art of Qi Huang in China, which is quite surprising. Everyone in China knows about acupuncture. The internal organs of the body are closely connected to the skin. By carefully identifying the location of the disease and applying slight stimulation to a certain part of the skin connected to it, the internal disease can be cured suddenly. This type of treatment should not be ignored. By what path did the Western medical community abandon its original knowledge and engage in Chinese medical skills, which they had never inquired about? This is an extremely interesting question. Westerners have also heard of acupuncture, but for hundreds of years, no one has paid any attention to it. In the early 19th century, the French had some exploration that was slightly related to acupuncture. Around 1820, Professor Wiel of the Paris Medical University (named Clark, surname) conducted various experiments on the connection between the internal organs of the body and the sensation of certain parts of the skin. Later, Doctor Danqiu wrote a book based on the results of this experiment called "The Law of Acupuncture." Although the number of experiments was extremely large, the results were not very good. The author's experimental method exceeded a considerable degree, because acupuncture only stimulates the sensation of the skin, but the experimenter used too much force and often pierced the diseased organ. Despite this, the original meaning of Chinese acupuncture gradually became clear, and Europeans continued to study it. In 1884, the French scholar Levens wrote a book called "Stomach and Brain," proving that stomach diseases are connected to the left side of the body. In 1893, Weir also explained that patients with lung disease also have this kind of internal and external correlation. However, both of them believed that this connection originated from a kind of "hysteria" (a kind of neurological disease especially felt by women). In 1894, the Englishman Heide also said that stimulation of certain internal organs can cause skin excretion. Due to the inventions of these people, European medicine gradually became closer to ancient Chinese medicine. After a few more years, a doctor named Ruo Gai denied that "hysteria" could cause such a phenomenon. By 1906, his student, Surillabo, presented a doctoral thesis and reached an important conclusion, stating that "nerve disorders on the skin are related to local diseases." Although Europeans were interested in the work of the above people, they were still laymen in the art of acupuncture. Later, Dabriti Tiel Sang wrote a book called "Chinese Medicine." Although recent experiments with reflex therapy to treat nasal organs and spines are similar to this, in fact, what acupuncture is is not understood by the general public. Recently, Suriel Molang has provided a detailed explanation of this matter. Suriel Molang was previously a consul in China and paid attention to Chinese medical skills. Soon he translated the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic, which existed 2,600 years before Jesus. In addition, Suriel Molang also obtained the assistance of Dr. Frielar and wrote a booklet called "Chinese Acupuncture—This book explains all the problems" and lists various experiments. In the past, Westerners regarded Chinese medicine as strange and thought it was beyond human power. Today, the facts are in place, and the value of Chinese medicine is undeniable by Westerners. Not only that, but the antiquity of Chinese medicine is equal to the history of its country. Although Western medicine is extremely complete in science, it cannot but study this thousands-year-old Chinese old science with a sincere and fearful attitude.</p>

<p>The Rights to Northeast Forests Fall Entirely into Japanese Hands Japanese Timber Has Been Lacking in Recent Years With Such Forest Reserves, It Can Look Down Upon the World Compatriots Urgently Rise Up to Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reports that Japan's forest rights in Manchuria were almost completely eliminated due to the influence of the "old warlords" there in the past. Since the emergence of "Manchukuo," there has been an opportunity to demand their revival. The majority owner of the forest areas, the Kyoei Kigyo Company (a joint venture between Oji Paper Company and Okura Gumi), has been negotiating with the military and the "Manchukuo government" since this summer for confirmation of rights, and has already obtained understanding and permission from all parties. The owners of the forest areas have thus begun to manage forest rights. The current plans for forest rights are as follows: (1) On the Japanese private sector side: Kyoei Kigyo Company (investment of 7 million yuan), South Manchuria Railway (investment of approximately 3 million yuan by companies such as Xinggu Company and Zhamian Company), Dongtuo and Hailin Company (investment of approximately 3 million yuan). (2) On the Japanese government side: Loans for forest and mineral resources in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces (part of the Nishihara loans), 30 million yuan. (3) On the Manchurian bank side: Capital amount unknown. Currently, the three parties are jointly planning to establish a large forest company jointly run by "Manchu" officials and Japanese civilians. At the same time, the private sector has submitted a detailed forest area plan, which is expected to be realized by April next year. If the Jidun Railway is completed, it will open a new era for the Japanese paper and timber industries. In recent years, Japan has felt a lack of timber. In addition to the 50% that can be supplied from the mainland, the remaining 50% can be relied upon on the exploitation of Manchuria, and the timber that was previously dependent on the northern Pacific region of the United States will no longer need to be dependent on foreigners. It is found that the forest storage volume in Manchuria reaches 14.9 billion dan. The accurate numbers are still unknown for areas such as the upper reaches of the Yalu River, Songhua River, Tumen River, Mudan River, and Hun River on the right bank, the Sansing area in the eastern section of the Middle East Railway, the western part of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, and the Daxinganling and Yilehuli forest zones in Heilongjiang Province. According to a survey by the Agricultural Affairs Section of the South Manchuria Railway's Industry Department, the data is as follows:</p>
<p>Forest Region Forest Area Standing Timber Volume</p>
<p>Right Bank of the Yalu River 980,931 435,352</p>
<p>Hun River Basin Tumen River Basin 832,563 433,600</p>
<p>Songhua River Basin 1,436,893 903,123</p>
<p>Mudan River Basin 634,775 301,150</p>
<p>Eastern Section of the Middle East Railway 2,651,065 924,652</p>
<p>Sansing Area 5,290,992 2,618,602</p>
<p>Daxinganling 14,000,000 5,600,000</p>
<p>Lesser Khingan Mountains 10,000,000 3,500,000</p>
<p>Total 36,461,126 15,135,462</p>
<p>According to the above rough calculations, the storage volume of the entire Manchuria region is approximately 15.03 billion dan, with approximately 14.9 billion standing trees, plus the unknown Daxinganling and Xiaoxinganling (approximately 6 billion or more), making it almost the only forest area in the world.</p>
<p>The Sichuan Situation Amidst the Infighting Between the Two Lius</p>
<p>Chongqing Air Mail: In the Sichuan provincial war, only the 21st and 24th armies are currently engaged in a desperate battle in the Jiading, Renshou, Jingyan, and Rongxian areas. The other major figures are all inactive. Liu Wenhui has used his tactics to pull back Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao, re-establishing cooperation. By winning over Yang Sen and Liu Cunhou, he has resolved the crisis of encirclement and can confidently disregard the rear and flanks, concentrating all his elite troops throughout Jiading, Renshou, and Jingyan, launching a fierce counterattack against the 21st Army, and plotting to recover the lost territories in southern Sichuan. Because Deng, Tian, Yang, and Liu are not taking action, Liu Xiang's front-line troops are finding it difficult to cope. He is also mobilizing troops from eastern Sichuan to fully resist the enemy. The two armies have thus begun their final showdown. It is estimated that from the 11th, both sides have had their victories and defeats, but it has not been too fierce. From the 18th to the 22nd, an unprecedented fierce battle occurred, with heavy losses on both sides. From the 22nd to the 24th, there was no major fierce battle. Regarding the situation of this battle, Liu Wenhui telegraphed all parties on the Yang (23rd) to report, and Liu Xiang's side also had a war report on the Jing (24th), which was described in detail. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui's Yang Telegram</p>
<p>The 24th Army's Liu Wenhui telegraphed to report the war situation, saying: "Since Hui left the province on the Zhai (7th) and stationed at the front, the vanguard of the Yu army has approached the riverbank in Jiading. I had no choice but to urgently defend myself. On the Zhen (11th), I ordered all routes to begin fighting on the three lines of Jia, Ren, and Jing. The Yu forces were the divisions of Pan, Tang, and the Model Division, Chen Lantian's brigade, Fan Shaozeng's division, and Xu Yaoqing's brigade, encountering the front line from Bizi Street on the opposite bank of Jiading, passing through Quanfu Market, Binxing Market, Wulong Market, Qianfo Temple, Mankan Mountain, Yan Jingwan, and Songfeng Market, with the left and right wings extending over 200 li. Both sides adopted offensive tactics, encountering each other in advance. The fierceness of the battle was unprecedented. On the Zhen (11th) at noon, our army occupied Bizi Street, Binxing Market, Quanfu Market, and Qianfo Temple. The enemy forces on the opposite bank of the Tong River were also defeated by our left-wing troops. On the Wen (12th), we also occupied Arekan, Mankan Mountain, Dongjiazhai, and Yan Jingwan. We discovered that the Yu army planned to use the complex terrain to construct fortifications and solid positions, using airplanes to drop bombs during the day and heavy artillery and machine guns to bombard us, and using flares at night to assist in shooting. Our soldiers fought bravely and selflessly. After two days and nights, on the Qin (13th), our left and right wings approached Matajing, occupied Songfeng Market, and captured the Tang division's position in Donglin Market, surrounding the market. On the Han (14th), our army occupied Donglin Market. On the Shan (15th), we divided our forces to pursue the enemy towards Yujia Market and Shuanggutian, with corpses scattered along the way and countless weapons abandoned. In the Matajing area, our Zhang and Peng brigades attacked its front on the Jiading-Rongxian road, while the Yu and Zhao brigades attacked its flank from Qianfo Temple and Mankan Mountain. On the Xian (16th) at noon, our army completely occupied it and advanced into Shanjian Town. The Yu army retreated towards the Shanjiao-Rongxian area and the area south of the Jiading-Rongxian Avenue. The counties of Niuhua, Wutongqiao, and Jianwei on the south bank were occupied by our army. On the Tiao (17th), our army concentrated the 11th Brigade to launch a fierce attack on the Yu army. On the Qiao (18th), our army occupied Rongxian and Weiyuan in one fell swoop. The vanguard almost crossed Xufu and directly approached Luxian. Later, due to the lack of reinforcements in our rear, we temporarily abandoned the front line and retreated to Rencheng, Jiayan, and Jingyan. On the Hao (19th), our army concentrated its elite and launched a fierce attack on the enemy, resulting in a major battle. On the He (20th), the vanguard made repeated advances. On the Ma (21st) and Yang (22nd), we recaptured Rongwei. Currently, our army is heading straight for Xufu and is engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy. Two fierce attacks lasted for four days. Both sides fought bloody battles, day and night. The fierceness of the battle exhausted the power of new and old weapons. Our army suffered more than 10,000 casualties, and dozens of battalion commanders were also killed in action. The Yu army suffered even greater casualties than us. After this battle, the enemy's self-proclaimed new weapons are no longer to be feared, and our army's bravery and solidity also have a point of self-confidence. The strong material power is ultimately not as good as the transcendence of spiritual power. Even the Guo Xun and Fan Shijie troops, which the enemy was proud of for their good fighting, are now dilapidated. This is the course of events since the start of the war. It is necessary to deeply rely on the poor military and martial arts to reflect on the fact that the poison of a bee sting cannot be too aggressive and that pride leads to defeat. At the beginning of the Sichuan war, Hui declared that as long as he could preserve the soldiers of our two armies for future service to national defense, Hui could automatically step down. Moreover, if the other party disliked my territory being too large, I would automatically cede more than a dozen counties, but I still did not receive understanding and kept pressing forward, taking the son and destroying the house, causing the soldiers of our army to shed blood in battle and fight to the death to survive. Today, where the smoke of gunpowder is, the villages have become ruins. In the rain of bullets and guns, corpses are piled up. Hui is not a warlike or ambitious person. Both sides have more than 200,000 strong soldiers who are not used as defenders to protect national defense but as tools of self-destruction. Regardless of who wins or loses, Hui is ashamed of it. What I am talking about here is to clarify the origin of the instigator, that the common people cannot be humiliated, and to await the public opinion of the sea and the court, and the other party's awakening, hoping to shorten the war zone and protect this offspring. I hope that the domestic sages and my Sichuan compatriots will examine it." Liu Wenhui Yang, Liu Xiang's Jing Telegram</p>
<p>The 21st Army's Liu Xiang telegraphed to report the war situation, saying: "Since our army started its campaign, it has been victorious in all directions, capturing famous cities one after another. The vanguard is approaching the Tong River and will soon capture Jiading. The enemy will be resolved soon. The enemy is desperately defending by relying on the terrain, trying to prolong their last gasp. They took advantage of our army's unpreparedness and suddenly launched a full-scale attack on us. Our army avoided its fierce flames. On the Qiao (18th), we temporarily retreated and abandoned Rongwei, concentrating our troops in Xiaoshi (under the jurisdiction of Luxian). On the Hao (19th), we recaptured it. I believe that the enemy army is on the verge of collapse, and its remaining power is exhausted. Due to our army's strategy, we are now concentrating our troops, preparing to wipe them out in one fell swoop. On the Ge day, we received a telegram from Songyao, who has dispatched troops to intercept the enemy's retreat. We are advancing to take Xin (Jin) and Shuang (Liu). Deng's army has also joined in. Li Luo is using Huaizhou to deter the enemy's rear. All are fully mobilized. The enemy will be destroyed. The Sichuan war is expected to be resolved within a week." Liu Xiang Kouching.</p>
<p>The Post-War Affairs Conference in Sichuan</p>
<p>The cooperation between the five units of Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Liu Wenhui, Liu Cunhou, and Yang Sen has been solidified. Deng and Tian took a special train from Chengdu to Jian to meet Yang Sen and discuss everything in person. They then persuaded Yang Sen to go to the province. The five units then held a Sichuan peace and post-war affairs conference in Chengdu. The location was in the provincial government. Deng, Tian, and Yang all attended in person. Liu Zhaoqian represented Liu Cunhou, and Xiang Qingren represented Liu Wenhui. There were four main cases in the meeting. They considered adopting the outline of governing Sichuan proposed by the 94 generals and Liu Wenhui's Jiang telegram's proposition, including (1) The 21st and 24th armies should immediately cease fighting in accordance with the clear order of the National Government. Liu Wenhui should still be stationed in the Jiading, Renshou, and Jingyan area, and Liu Xiang should return to the original defense and hand over the 24th Army's defense area to the coalition forces for handling. Otherwise, armed mediation would be carried out, and the four units of Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, and Yang Sen would send troops to cut off both sides and prohibit further fighting. If there was any non-compliance, the coalition forces would resolve it. (2) The organization of the Sichuan Political Consolidation Committee should be improved. Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Liu Wenhui, Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, Liu Xiang, Li Qixiang, Luo Zezhou, Xiang Xiren, Sun Zhen, Wang Fangzhou, Liu Zhaoqian, Qiao Zhongquan, and Chen Shunong, a total of 14 people, would be appointed as ex officio members, and Zhang Yuejun, a member of the Central Committee with Sichuan origin, would be welcomed back to Sichuan to serve as the chairman of the committee, responsible for consolidating Sichuan's politics. (3) The Sichuan Provincial Military Commission would be established, jointly formed by military generals from Sichuan and personnel sent by the Central Government. Its content would include the following three items: 1. The Reduction and Compilation Committee would be responsible for supervising each army to carry out proportional reduction and compilation. The entire Sichuan province should not exceed 20 divisions at most. 2. The Military Expenditure Committee would be responsible for the overall planning and unified distribution of military expenses for each army. 3. The Land Reception Committee would be responsible for receiving the counties in each army's defense area, breaking the defense area system, and allowing each army to be stationed in various locations as appropriate. (4) The Sichuan-Kang Border Defense Committee would be organized jointly by military generals to consolidate Sichuan-Kang border defense. It is reported that the five capitals have issued a message to cease the war in Chengdu, with all five generals signing their names (the text of the telegram is unknown), requesting the two armies to cease fighting and negotiate peace. In this situation, there is a glimmer of hope for the future of the Sichuan situation.</p>
<p>A Wave of Peace Calls In the midst of the Sichuan war, the National Government issued a clear order to cease the war. People from Sichuan residing abroad and people from all walks of life in the province have successively appealed for peace, but they have been unable to slightly curb the warlords' ambitions. They have exploited the people and disregarded everything, leading to the revolutionary nature of the people of Sichuan. Therefore, the Alliance to Abolish War and the Great Alliance Against War were established, calling for strikes, farming strikes, work strikes, school strikes, and resistance to donations and taxes, which has attracted the attention of the warlords. At the same time, Zhu Demen and others, who organized the National Salvation Self-Defense Army in Northeast China, telegraphed various generals, requesting them to stop internal strife and resist foreign aggression, and to donate the military funds and ammunition consumed in the civil war to the army for the recovery of lost territory, for the sake of national glory and the honor of the people of Sichuan. The Shanghai National Salvation Organizations Federation also sent Wu Rubai, a director of the federation, to Sichuan to mediate the war. Wu has arrived in Chongqing and is now traveling to the front line to meet with Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui, requesting them to immediately stop the war. Wu has expressed to others that he vows not to return alive unless the Sichuan war is resolved, indicating a willingness to risk his life to fight the warlords on behalf of 70 million people.</p>
<p>The Current Situation of the Sichuan Army</p>
<p>(1) The 29th Army, under Tian Songyao, originally had only 50,000 men. It suffered more than 10,000 casualties in this operation. Tian took advantage of the chaotic situation in Sichuan to greatly expand his forces. In addition to the original 1st Division (Dong Chang'an), 2nd Division (Zeng Xiantong), 3rd Division (Luo Naiqiong), 4th Division (Wang Mingzhang), and Independent Division (Huang Zhenggui), he has now expanded to five more divisions, with the Independent Division (Huang Zhenggui) being reorganized into the 5th Division, the 1st Route Commander (Li Weiru) becoming the 6th Division, the 2nd Route Commander (Liu Hanxiong) becoming the 7th Division, the 3rd Route Commander (He Deyu) becoming the 8th Division, and the Independent Commander (Yang Jie) becoming the 9th Division. Another brigade commander, Tian Zefu, was appointed as the 10th Division Commander. Each division is prescribed to have 10,000 men, totaling approximately 100,000 men. (2) The 28th Army, under Deng Xihou, originally had 40,000 men. It has also been reorganized and expanded, with Huang Yimin's division becoming the 1st Division, Ma Dezai's division becoming the 2nd Division, Chen Shunong's division becoming the 3rd Division, Yang Xiuchun's brigade becoming the Model Division, and Chen Jingshan's brigade becoming the Education Division. Each division is prescribed to have 12,000 men, totaling approximately 60,000 men. (3) The 24th Army, under Liu Wenhui, originally had 110,000 men. It suffered considerable losses in this operation. Liu is now recruiting local soldiers in his hometown of Dayi and recruiting new soldiers in various counties to replenish his troops. He has now recruited more than 10,000 men. (4) The 21st Army, under Liu Xiang, originally had approximately 100,000 men. Due to suppressing bandits in western Hubei and this operation, there were many deaths. In order to replenish his army, Liu ordered each county in the defense area to send 300 soldiers, implementing a conscription system. More than 40 counties can obtain 11,000 to 12,000 men. Moreover, the approximately 10,000 laborers sent by each county have also been forcibly incorporated into the troops by Liu Xiang as new soldiers and deceived to the front line. (5) The 20th Army, under Yang Sen, originally had approximately 30,000 men, consisting of five mixed brigades. Yang has now reorganized them into three divisions, with Yu Mengqun as the 1st Division, Qiao Deshou as the 2nd Division, and Yang Hanzhong as the 3rd Division.

<p>Military Expenses in Sichuan Province</p>
<p>For the past five years, Sichuan Province has had an unbreakable defense area system. Each army occupies a certain area, and all the people and property in the defense area are handled by the leader of the army. Outsiders are not allowed to interfere. Under this situation, the ambitious warlords have unscrupulously plundered, imposing three, four, five, or even six levies of grain tax a year. There are also temporary military expenses, borrowing, raising, allocating funds, and various taxes, which are countless. After the warlords have scraped the people's fat and blood, they use it to expand their military strength. From 1928 to the present, for five years, the people of Sichuan have borne a total of 235 million yuan in military expenses each year. On average, 70 million men, women, and children must bear more than three yuan each year. In five years, a total of 1.175 billion yuan has been spent. The people's fat and blood have been sucked clean by the warlords, and they are still fighting each other endlessly, year after year. It is no wonder that the world calls Sichuan a devil's den.

<p>Inspection Report on Suppressing the Communists and Recovering Various Areas An Inspection of the Communist Bandit's Nest in Honghu</p>
<p>Famous Bandit Leaders</p>
<p>Among the famous bandit leaders of the Honghu Communist bandits, the military leaders are He Long, Duan Dechang, Zheng Jixun, Wang Yimin, etc. On the political side, there are Xia Xi, Lu Yi, Pan Jiaxun, Wan Tao, Deng Zongxia, Zhou Yichun, Cui Qi, Ma Wu, Peng Zhiyu, etc. The famous female bandit leaders are He Long's sister He Ying, Duan Dechang's sister Duan Wuxian, and Qian Ying, etc. The origins of He, Duan, and Kuang have been mentioned above. Wang Yimin is unknown. Among the military bandit leaders, Duan Dechang is the most alert. In the beginning, he only had one rifle and gathered twenty or thirty bandits. They gradually plundered the guns of the police and security groups in the western Hubei area, and their momentum began to grow. His method of robbing police guns was extremely clever, often beyond expectation. In the beginning, he led his bandits to sneak into Lijiashi at night, carrying only one rifle himself. The rest of the bandits each held spears and scattered around the town. Duan first went to the east of the town and fired a shot, then turned to the west, south, and north of the town and fired a shot in each direction. The residents of the town were awakened at night and heard gunshots coming from all directions. They did not know the details and thought that they were surrounded by Communist bandits on all sides. They thought that the bandits must be numerous and did not know how many guns there were. They were all afraid beyond description, and the police were also at a loss, allowing them to steal their weapons. After Duan's bandits seized the police guns, they robbed some property and marched through the town several times to show their power before leaving. The residents only heard the Communist bandits coming and going continuously, and they all thought that the bandits' power was extremely strong. They did not expect that the bandits only had twenty or thirty people and only one rifle. One day, the Zhoujiazui Security Team was drilling when Duan's bandits, leading forty or fifty people, disguised themselves and surrounded them to watch. Some pretended to be chopping firewood, some were selling grilled fish, some were peddlers, and some were onlookers, all dispersed to watch the drill. The security team had a total of twenty-four people. After the drill was over, they reported the number and prepared to return to the team to rest. When they reported to twenty-four, Duan suddenly shouted twenty-five from the crowd and fired a shot as a signal. Upon hearing the gunshot, the surrounding bandits rushed up from all sides and surrounded the security team. The security team was caught off guard and surrendered their weapons. After Duan got the guns, he roared away, like a reenactment of the Liangshan heroes robbing the execution ground. It is said that Duan's bandits read the Water Margin enthusiastically and were able to use the ancients and transform them. Xia Xi once served as the secretary of the pseudo-Hunan-Hubei-West Central Bureau of the Communist Party, managing the party affairs of western Hunan and Hubei. He was very powerful. Later, due to some suspicion, he was removed from his position by the Communist Party and fled in fear of punishment. Lu Yi was from Changde, Hunan, 46 years old. He was extremely qualified among the Communist bandits. After Xia Xi was no longer in charge of party affairs in the western Hunan and Hubei red area, he served as the political minister of the Pseudo-Hunan-Hubei-West Soviet Military Commission, concurrently serving as the chairman of the pseudo-military court and the political commissar of the pseudo-7th Division. Before the Honghu bandit nest was broken, he held great power in the western Hunan and Hubei red area in February and March. When the National Army broke the bandit nest, he was arrested in Yanglinguan and sent to the headquarters of the Tenth Army in Yuekou for strict interrogation. The bandit's attitude was unusually stubborn. He was later executed in Yuekou. He showed no fear before the execution and raised his head to be killed. Pan Jiaxun, Wan Tao, Deng Zongxia, Zhou Yichun, etc. were mostly people from Hubei. The Communist bandits considered them to be reorganized factions. They were either killed in the anti-rebellion movement or fled. Their whereabouts are currently unknown. Cui Qi once served as the chairman of the Pseudo-Hunan-Hubei Soviet Province. After the bandit nest was broken, his whereabouts are unknown. Ma Wu was one of the Pseudo-Hunan-Hubei chief group and was the son of a farmer. He is now 32 years old and does not look like an evil person. He was captured after the bandit nest was broken and is currently detained at the headquarters of the Tenth Army in Yuekou. He may be able to save his life. Peng Zhiyu was also one of the Pseudo-Hunan-Hubei chief group. His whereabouts are unknown. The female bandit He Ying, relying on the power of her brother He Long, acted recklessly and violently. She killed many people. She is now fleeing west with He Long, and her life and death are unknown. Duan Wuxian is only sixteen or seventeen years old, beautiful and fierce, and kills people like hemp. She and He Ying are known together. She was arrested near Jianli and has been executed in Yuekou. Qian Ying was a widow who joined the Communist Party due to family problems. With the assistance of the Communist Party, she studied in Russia. After returning to China, she became a bandit in the Hunan-Hubei-West red area. She embraced celibacy and engaged in free promiscuity. She was quite prominent among the female bandits. The innocent people killed by her are countless. She was arrested and executed in Qianjiang this autumn. After the Honghu bandit nest was broken, most of the bandit leaders in political work were captured and executed, except for military bandit leaders such as He and Duan who escaped. After this painful suppression, the Communist bandits in central Hubei were mostly wiped out. There are currently no bandit tracks in central Hubei, and the people can gradually live in peace.</p>
<p>Recovery Process</p>
<p>After the Communist bandits in central Hubei were defeated by the National Army on the north bank of the Xiang River, the pseudo-7th, 8th, 9th, and 3rd divisions suffered heavy losses and fled back to the old nest in Honghu. The two bandits, He Long and Duan Dechang, separately led the remnants of the pseudo-8th and 9th divisions and concentrated in the Xionkou-Longwan area to resist the pursuing troops. The important nests on the south bank of the Xiang River and both banks of the East Jing River, such as Lao Xinkou, Xinkou, Zhouliuzui, Yanglinguan, and the areas surrounding Honghu, such as Fenyen, Liukai, Qujiawan, Xiaoshakou, Fengkou, and Zhuhe, were defended by Wang Yimin's pseudo-7th Division and the pseudo-Guard Division, respectively, and extremely solid fortifications were built as a means of resistance. The National Army divided into left and right wings to suppress them. The commander-in-chief of the left wing was concurrently held by Xu Yuanquan, commanding the 41st, 44th, 48th, and 34th divisions and the New 3rd Brigade and the Independent 37th Brigade, encircling and suppressing them from the east, west, and south. The commander-in-chief of the right wing was Wang Lingji, leading his troops from Jingzhou and Shashi to prevent the Communist bandits from fleeing west. On August 18, the Xu Jiwu and Huang Xin brigades of the 48th Division crossed the river from Yuekou and advanced south. At dawn on the 24th, they besieged Fu Market. After several hours of fierce fighting, the bandit forces were unable to support themselves and Fu Market was completely occupied. At the same time, the 34th Division also crossed the river from places such as Shijiagang and Baimiao and occupied Fengkou at noon on the 24th. On August 31, the Zhang Zhenhan unit of the 41st Division attacked places such as Xinkou and Zhouliuzui, defeating the remnants of Wang Yimin's pseudo-7th Division. The bandit Wang barely escaped with his life. Bandit leader Lu Yi was captured, and countless others were killed or captured alive. After the bandits lost the important nests of Xinkou and Zhouliuzui, they collapsed towards the old nest of Qujiawan. With their elite exhausted, they no longer had the ability to resist. The National Army pursued, and their momentum was like splitting bamboo. The important</p>

A record of the grand occasion follows:</p>
<p>▲Grand Birthday Celebration</p>
<p>The birthday hall was set up in the main hall of the East Asia Restaurant on Nanjing Road. More than two hundred and fifty people attended. First, the colleagues present offered a toast to Mr. Zhang, who responded with extremely humble and sincere words, moving all those present. After the presentation of birthday gifts, General Manager Shi Liangcai delivered a speech, saying: "This year marks the 60th anniversary of our newspaper, and we also celebrate Mr. Zhang's sixtieth birthday, which is truly rare. Mr. Zhang is of high moral character and has served this newspaper for more than thirty years as if it were just one day. I hope that colleagues will strive forward with this spirit, so that in the future, for seventy, eighty, one hundred, two hundred years, we can advance with the times and achieve boundless longevity together. May Mr. Zhang grow stronger with age. I offer this as a special congratulation." Mr. Zhang also thanked everyone in return. Subsequently, colleagues' representatives Zhou Shoujuan and Ma Yinliang delivered congratulatory speeches, and a round of applause erupted. A photograph was taken on the spot as a memento. Finally, the celebration concluded with performances of traditional Chinese martial arts, Kunqu opera, and Beijing opera.</p>
<p>Colleagues' Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>The colleagues of the Editorial Department offer their congratulations, saying: "Mr. Zhang Yunhe of Yun Jian is renowned for his outstanding learning and noble character, serving as the editor-in-chief for over thirty years. His upright arguments benefit the world, serving as the voice of the people. His discernment is keen and penetrating, winning the hearts of all. Recognizing the weight of his responsibility, he is deeply conscientious and devoted to public service, leading by example, rigorously checking and verifying, and carefully managing affairs. He exhausts his body and mind, sacrificing sleep and meals. With accumulated years, he remains diligent and cautious. His diligence in his duties is unparalleled. People far and near praise Mr. Zhang, but he remains humble. He embodies the great way, never being petty or trivial. He is respectful and principled, behaving properly at all times. His peers admire his integrity, and his subordinates regard him as a model. He is kind-hearted and particularly skilled in managing people. He is gentle and unassuming in ordinary life, using subtle and tactful words to persuade and encourage. His followers are inspired and deeply moved. He is strict with himself and generous in helping others. He can be described as purely constant and amiable. January of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China marks Mr. Zhang's sixtieth birthday. We, like Meng Xiong, have long been blessed by his guidance. His profound words and admirable virtue are deeply impressed upon our hearts. We believe that just as Dong Jiangdu spoke of long service rewarding longevity, and Gou Lanling spoke of good intentions prolonging life, these words are fitting for Mr. Zhang. Drawing from his past deeds and looking forward to the future, we humbly express our heartfelt congratulations.</p>

<p>Representatives from All Sectors Console Anti-Japanese Generals of the Fifth Army</p>
<p>Representatives from Agriculture, Commerce, Industry, and Academia Participate</p>
<p>General Sun and Brigade Commander Li Deliver Eloquent Speeches</p>
<p>The Shanghai community held a grand assembly yesterday to console the anti-Japanese generals of the Fifth Army. An investigation into the event follows:</p>
<p>Guests included Eighty-eighth Division Commander Sun Yuanliang, Brigade Commander Li Yueyang, and Brigade Commander Song Xilian, who was unable to attend due to other important matters. Hosts included representatives from the Citizens' Association Preparatory Committee, the United National Salvation Associations of Various Organizations, the General Labor Union, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Citizens' Association, the Chinese Academic Society, the Newspaper Workers' Union, the Distribution Workers' Union, the Sichuan Fellow Townsmen Association, the United Associations of Student Friends from Various Provinces in Shanghai, the Sichuan National Salvation Association, the Chinese National Diplomacy Association, the National Salvation Association, the Xinhai Revolution Comrades Association, the Quan Chong Association, the Film Education Association, the United Association of Primary and Secondary Schools in the French Concession, and over thirty other organizations, as well as representatives from all walks of life including Feng Shaoshan, Zhao Nangong, Wang Huiguan, Li Qingfan, Kang Xuanyi, Chen Yafu, Huang Hao, Chen Peide, Jiang Zhensan, Shen Zuru, Wang Xuequan, Zheng Yongzhi, Jiang Liangfu, Guo Ping, Mao Yufeng, Zhu Chaoran, Song An, Li Xiaoti, Zhang Yaoming, Wu Zhiqian, Zhu Lin, Chen Dawei, Li Chongpu, Gao Xiangzhi, Ma Zaiqiang, Liu Chuanzhong, Huang Xuchu, Feng Mingzheng, Li Kaixian, and female representatives including Miao Xiajing, Ms. Tao, and over seventy others.</p>
<p>The assembly began with Chairman Kang Xuanyi delivering a speech of condolence on behalf of all those present, stating: "The nation knows of General Sun and Commander Li's meritorious service in resisting Japan, but they may not know that these two gentlemen are also young generals with profound knowledge and cultivation. I have been friends with these two gentlemen for many years, so I will briefly introduce their detailed academic backgrounds, (excerpt) and hope that in the future, the two gentlemen can work together with people from all walks of life to strive forward in the cause of national salvation." He then raised his glass to wish the two gentlemen good health.</p>
<p>Following this, General Sun responded, stating: "Defending the nation is the duty of soldiers, and resisting Japan is our responsibility. We do not dare to accept condolences. During the January 28th Incident, the Fifth Army and the Nineteenth Route Army cooperated sincerely, which allowed us to resist the strong enemy. At that time, reactionaries deliberately provoked discord, claiming that the government had no intention of resisting. However, the facts speak for themselves. All sectors can now understand the truth."</p>
<p>Next, Brigade Commander Li responded, saying: "Our army was able to resist the violent Japanese entirely because of the spiritual and material support of the people. The foreign crisis is rising and has not yet subsided. In the future, we hope that the military and the people will cooperate and work together to save the nation."</p>
<p>Following this, Huang Hao delivered a speech, stating: "The January 28th Anti-Japanese War, thanks to the meritorious service of the Fifth Army, has proven that the government's army is the people's force. In the future, our people must understand the government's policies, trust the government's army, and further engage actively in domestic construction, strengthening our physical strength, so that we can lead the nation with one heart and fight."</p>
<p>Finally, Zhu Lin, Chen Peide, Shen Zuru, Li Qingfan, and others delivered speeches in succession. Their words were earnest and heartfelt, moving the entire audience. In the end, the entire group took a photograph and dispersed joyfully.</p>
<p>Report on Recent Work of the Volunteer Army Medical Team</p>
<p>Hosted the Press Yesterday</p>
<p>Second Batch Has Arrived at Huahuzhuang</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Medical Team hosted the local press at its office in Xiaonanmen at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than ten reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. Chairman Wu Huiquan reported on the team's recent work progress. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Wu Huiquan reported on the team's recent medical work, stating: "Our team has been organized for several months now. The first batch of team members is already implementing medical work in the Fourth Route Volunteer Army unit of Geng Jizhou in Beipiao, Liaoning. The second batch of team members reported in a telegram yesterday that they have safely arrived at Huahuzhuang and are working in Zheng Gui'an's unit. The third batch of team members, consisting of previously selected members and the medical team organized by the Zhenjiang Anti-Japanese Association, has been reorganized and is now ready. Once the preparations for medicines and other items are complete, they will set off on schedule. However, our colleagues have limited abilities, and we hope that everyone will publicize our efforts as much as possible so that all sectors can provide material assistance."</p>
<p>Telegram Announcing Departure</p>
<p>The team's Shanghai office received a telegram yesterday from Chen Ruchen, the leader of the second team at the front lines. The original text is as follows: "To the Shanghai office of the Northeast Volunteer Army Medical Team: We departed from Xuzhou on the eighth of the month and arrived in Ping on the tenth. After staying for several days, we departed on the Beijing-Fengtian train at 8:00 PM on the fourteenth. We got off at Liushouying in the morning of the fifteenth. We proceeded on foot out of the pass. While passing through Luotaizi, due to unfamiliarity with the geography, surrounded by countless mountains, the situation was extremely dangerous. We encountered the puppet state army, who immediately opened fire, attacking head-on. All the members of our team were unarmed, and the order was slightly disrupted. While Ruchen was leading the way on horseback, the horse was startled by the gunfire and threw him to the ground, resulting in injuries to his left arm and waist, almost causing him to die. Fortunately, at this critical moment, officers and soldiers of the Eleventh Brigade of the Fifth Route Volunteer Army, who were patrolling in the field, came to the rescue, resolving the danger. Our team arrived at Huahuzhuang, where we assembled and counted the members, who were all safe and unharmed. On the nineteenth, we arrived at Yong'anpu and joined the Fifth Route front line. On the twentieth, the team leader led all personnel to distribute work at the front line. Stretcher squad leader Gao Yadong and Han Zhaoxiang led the stretcher bearers to reside at Dadianzi. Medical section chief Wang Ruidong led all section members to reside at Caofangzi. The medical section set up a dressing station at Huahuzhuang, with medical director Li Baobinqiu leading the medical staff to carry out the work. The temporary hospital was established at Daliuzhuang. Transportation section chief Gao Xinru was responsible for transporting the wounded soldiers. The staff of our team have already been assigned and are ready for work. However, our team lacks supplies, and the weather is extremely cold. The staff members have no winter clothing. Please provide assistance with all your strength. This concerns a good deed. Please approve our request. In urgent need of orders. Chen Ruchen, leader of the Second Team of the Northeast Volunteer Army Medical Team, respectfully awaits a reply from the rear."</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram from the Second Team at the front, the team replied to the front yesterday. The original text of the telegram is as follows: "To Team Leader Chen: We have received your telegram. Former Deputy Team Leader Ge Minglong came to the general office and took away medicines worth seventy yuan, ten sets of military uniforms, fifty rolls of white cloth, eight pounds of cotton gauze, thirty yuan for travel expenses, ten cotton quilts, and ninety sets of thermal underwear. Now, we have received a telegram from Cheng Zhixuan, the person in charge in Beiping, stating that Deputy Team Leader Ge has not yet arrived in Ping to return to the team, which is extremely worrying. We remitted one hundred yuan from the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank on the sixteenth, to be transferred and sent by Ping. We received a telegram from Ping on the twenty-fourth, informing us that this money has already been received by Cheng Zhixuan. Future funds will be allocated and sent one after another. We also hope that you will report the ten-day and monthly reports to the office on schedule for verification. All news from the front must be sent to Shanghai by telegram once a week. Sincerely, The Shanghai General Office of the Northeast Volunteer Army Medical Team."</p>

<p>An Agreement is Signed to Determine Rotating Work Schedules</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the suspension of the night shift in the cloth weaving workshop of the Shenxin No. 1 Textile Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai, the labor union, recognizing the seriousness of the matter, convened a workers' representative assembly to determine a course of action. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a labor-management mediation committee for formal mediation. The committee members present were Lu Yinchu from the Municipal Party Department, Tang Mengxiong and Wen Xirong from the management, Sun Shouxiang and Fan Luquan from the labor side, Zhu Guilin, the chairman of the committee from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Wang Zuofang, the recorder. The labor side first stated that the workers' assembly had resolved to oppose the management's further suspension of the night shift for the second and third groups. As for the wage deductions for the first group of machinists, the current situation should be temporarily maintained. After discussion, both sides agreed and signed the following record: The dispute between the parties concerned over the dismissal of workers was mediated by this committee. Now, with the consent of both parties, an agreement is signed and recorded as follows: (1) Due to the sluggish business in the cloth weaving workshop of the Shenxin No. 1 Factory, the night shift is temporarily suspended. The first group is changed to a rotating work schedule. If business improves, the original situation will be restored. (2) The rotating work schedule is as follows: By analogy, the suspended groups are Kun 1, numbers 2 and 3; Kun 2, numbers 4 and 5; Kun 3, numbers 6 and 7; Qian 3, numbers 8 and 9; Qian 2, numbers 10 and 11; Qian 1, numbers 12 and 13. (3) The wages of the machinists in the Qian 1 group, who calculate their wages on a daily basis, are adjusted by the factory to long-term work. The wages of the laid-off workers are deducted, and they are not allowed to do outside work. This matter has been signed by both parties with their consent. The mediation is successful and should be regarded as a labor contract between the parties concerned.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Petitions for the Opening of the Majiawan Dam</p>
<p>Zheng Zenan is Recommended to the Jiangsu Construction Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Jiangsu Construction Department yesterday to petition for the opening of the Majiawan Dam, stating: "Regarding the matter of the grain and cake industry requesting the opening of the Majiawan Dam, we telegraphed your department on the sixteenth of this month, and received a reply stating that the dam would be opened after dredging work was completed.

It is necessary to personally visit your department to petition for a prompt opening. Therefore, our chamber has recommended Executive Committee Member Zheng Zenan, accompanied by Wang Gongyi, a representative from the Grain Association, to visit your department with an official letter to petition.

<p>The Homeowner in Dafeng Lane Denies Robbery and Kidnapping</p>
<p>Around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, three robbers armed with handguns suddenly broke into house number two of Dafeng Lane, Huanlong Road in the French Concession, ordering everyone to remain silent. They searched the house and stole gold jewelry and silver coins worth approximately six to seven hundred yuan. As they left, they also kidnapped a young child. By the time the homeowner chased after them, the robbers had vanished without a trace. The homeowner immediately reported the incident to the police station.</p>
<p>When our reporter heard the news and went to investigate, the police station remained tight-lipped and no information could be obtained. The reporter then went to the homeowner's residence to inquire. The lane was a narrow alley, with three small Western-style houses at the west end. The house in the middle, number two, was the homeowner's residence. However, the gate was tightly closed and there was a faint light on the upper floor. After calling for a long time, a young woman peered out of the upstairs window. When the reporter explained his intentions, the young woman responded hastily, insisting that her house had not been robbed and that all the children were safe and sound. Her contradictory manner was evident in her words.</p>
<p>The reporter then inquired at various shops near the entrance of the lane and learned that the incident had indeed occurred at lane number two. However, when asked about the homeowner's name, they all smiled and remained silent, only pointing to a covered car parked near the entrance of the lane, indicating that it was the homeowner's private vehicle.</p>

<p>Huacheng's Special Mark for Golden Mouse Cigarettes</p>
<p>Everyone who smokes cigarettes knows that the Golden Mouse brand is the leader in affordable cigarettes. Its wide sales are outstanding. However, some unscrupulous merchants have been coveting it, and some have been counterfeiting and selling it. Not only does the company's reputation suffer, but also those who love to smoke this brand of cigarettes are greatly harmed. Therefore, in addition to offering a generous reward to prevent counterfeiting, the company has added a small "Huacheng" mark to the cigarette paper. The design is very beautiful, so that smokers will not be deceived into buying counterfeit goods. It is now reported that counterfeiters have nowhere to hide. The sales of this cigarette are even more popular, and recently there has been an oversupply. In these times of national crisis, the news of the booming sales of this domestic product should be welcomed by patriots.</p>

Therefore, when the bid for gold opened, it was as high as 829 taels and 3 mace. Heng Yu Yuan Mao Yong bought in, rising to over 30 taels.

The registration price for December was 827 taels, and the registration prices for January and February were both 826 taels. Make-up water was at 823 taels. Speculation trends were mixed, and the quantity was not much.　　In over-the-counter transactions, Fu Yu Yong, Heng Xing, Wan Xing, Da De Cheng, Tong Feng Heng, and Da Yu Yong all bought in.

Therefore, the British exchange rate opened at 1 shilling and 7 pence and 0.625, only 0.0625 tighter than the previous close. The New York silver price decreased by 0.25, and the forward silver price fell by a small 3.5% to 4.5%. The bank private cable also decreased by 0.3125. Therefore, the recent American exchange rate opened at 27.1875, which was 0.125 tighter than the previous close. The HSBC exchange rate listed both British and American exchange rates as decreasing, and the market was slightly tighter. Finally, a telegram came stating that war debts would be repaid with silver, and the price of gold fell, and the exchange rate tightened accordingly. As a result, both British and American exchange rates decreased by 0.125 compared to before the market closed. The fluctuations in the half-day were minimal, and the buying and selling were very calm. Dealers first tightened, then loosened, but there were very few transactions. The same was true for banks.　　(British Exchange Rate) The entire market was very calm. The spot rate opened at 1 shilling and 7 pence and 0.625. Later, due to the listing rate decreasing by 0.25, the trend gradually tightened. Mitsui bought in December at 0.5625, which was profitable for selling.

Exchange rates must be in accordance with the exchange rates set by the bank.　　The government report stated that due to political instability, large purchases of drafts through irregular procedures, and the use of gold coins as savings, these irregular facts continue unabated, making bank lending very risky. The Federal Government had to take emergency and beneficial steps to protect the country's gold reserves and exchange rates. The government, in view of the environmental situation, agreed to abolish the gold standard, so that the Reserve Bank is not responsible for gold exchange.　　Reopening Day　　The Financial World is Extremely Busy　　Four Days of Collection and Settlement　　Concentrated on One Day for Clearing　　The Time is Especially Extended to Facilitate Full Acceptance　　The Bund banks closed for three days for the Winter Solstice holiday, and all have resumed business yesterday. All kinds of collection and settlement and transactions that should have been sorted out during these four days must be completed on this day. Therefore, the busyness in procedures can be imagined. Moreover, the end of the year is approaching in the blink of an eye, and the annual grand opening is in these few days, and the prosperity is self-evident. After extensive probing by reporters, it was said that due to procedural issues, preliminary calculations could not be made, and accurate figures would be difficult to obtain until after 10 PM. Therefore, we can only briefly describe what we know as follows.　　Higher Interest Rates Lead to More Selling and Lower Prices　　Silver Lending Remains Stable　　The interest rate on silver dollars in the early and afternoon markets was 7 mace, 1 fen, and 3.5 li, slightly lower by 1 li and 1 hao and 2 hu than the early market on the previous day. This was because the selling pressure in the early market was too strong, and confidence was weak, leading to the decline. The volume of transactions in the afternoon market was 60 yuan, eventually similar to the early market. The "silver lending" rate in the early and afternoon markets was the same, 0.02, slightly more vibrant than the white lending market on the previous day. Initially, there was no added interest on clearing, but later there were still rates of 0.02 to 0.03.　　Silver Coins Trend Lower　　Copper Coins Rebound　　Jiangnan silver coins, after a rebound the previous day, fell again yesterday morning, lower by 0.03, to 6 mace, 3 fen, and 5 li. The situation was difficult to stabilize, but price fluctuations were difficult to predict. There were few transactions in the afternoon market, and the price did not move. The volume of transactions was 8,500 jiao in the early market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong silver coins also fell slightly by 0.05 in the early market, to 6 mace, 1 fen, and 5 li. The afternoon market rebounded by 0.025, to 6 mace, 1 fen, and 7.5 li. The volume of transactions was 112,000 jiao in the early market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins, for no reason, decreased by another 3,500 wen, to 390,000 wen. Transactions were also low, only 9,400 taels, equivalent to 36,660 strings of copper coins.　　Silver Collection and Settlement is Busy　　Foreign Exchange is Also Extremely Active　　"Silver collection" was particularly high yesterday due to the reopening of banks, and the time for collecting tickets was especially extended. All kinds of sorting and rates were extended, and acceptance was handled calmly. Therefore, detailed amounts of various collections were unavailable within the drafting time. According to rough estimates, foreign bank collections were even more, totaling no less than 20 million or more. Local bank collections were also in the range of several million. According to what is known, foreign merchant collections totaled more than 5 million, and Chinese merchant collections also totaled more than 3 million. Money shops and silver shops alone collected more than 39 million. Clearing collections totaled more than 5.7 million. Remittances from various routes totaled more than 1.4 million.

Banknotes amounted to 115,000 in the early market and 85,000 in the afternoon market. Off-exchange banknotes amounted to 140,000 in the early market and 130,000 in the afternoon market. Checks amounted to 175,000 in the early market and 65,000 in the afternoon market. Bank transactions amounted to 1.3 million in the early market and 950,000 in the afternoon market. Foreign exchange collections between banks totaled more than 2.2 million. Banknote inflows and outflows totaled more than 2 million. Money shop foreign exchange collections totaled more than 1.05 million. Foreign exchange clearing collections totaled more than 230,000. Special loan foreign exchange inflows and outflows totaled more than 260,000. Small money shop transactions totaled more than 1.2 million.　　Review of the Bombay Silver Market　　Bombay, 24th Telegram: Mao Wenqi Company's silver market report states that the silver market weakened last week following foreign silver prices. Domestic silver demand has increased, and domestic sources have almost ceased. The local jewelry industry is not in a healthy position, and there is no significant development. Domestic silver demand is 65 bars per day, an increase of 10 bars compared to the previous week's 55 bars. It is now estimated that by January 16, silver reserves will increase by 9,500 bars. London bar silver imports last week were still worth £40,000, the same as the previous week.

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Guangdong Merchants Procure Large Quantities of Futures and Spot Yarn</p>
<p>Sichuan Merchants Also Show Interest</p>
<p>Bidding Market Therefore Extremely Popular</p>
<p>Due to the real demand for cotton yarn, the Guangdong merchants in the southern ports are busy procuring a large amount of futures. Sichuan merchants are also showing interest, causing confidence to suddenly tighten. Retail investors are active in offsetting positions. The market rose in the afternoon, but since this month is the last day, some longs closed out positions. Those taking delivery were mostly financial institutions absorbing for arbitrage. Therefore, the market passed quietly. The bidding yarn market was greatly boosted by real demand.</p>
<p>In the opening of the pre-market bidding, the market atmosphere was calm. Due to no fluctuations in American cotton, there was a lack of buyers in the market. Each month fell by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Guangdong merchants were improving their actual sales, and the market situation became even tighter. The prices of Kang cotton in the second and third markets trended upward, and the situation became increasingly strong. Each month rose by 0.08 to 0.09 yuan to 0.12 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 32,600 dan. It was verified that 1,350 bales were sold by Chu Geng, 1,250 bales by Yuan Da, 1,100 bales by Yi Chang, 950 bales by Ming De, and 850 bales by Chang Feng. 3,200 bales were bought by Xin Cheng, 1,650 bales by Da Fu, 1,000 bales by Chun Ji, 950 bales by Da Feng, and 1,150 bales by Yuan Tai. The closing prices are listed below. Fluctuations in Bidding Market Closing Prices</p>

<p>Over 2,000 Bales of Spot Yarn Traded</p>
<p>The movement of spot yarn suddenly became smooth. It was verified that the total statistics of spot and futures purchased by various guilds throughout the day was 2,745 bales. The market price rose by 0.05 yuan. Dafeng Factory opened with 650 bales of 10-count sailing ship yarn in February-March. Shenxin Factory opened with 100 bales of 16-count "Good to Do" yarn and 60 bales of 42-count "Ren Jing" yarn, and 75 bales of "Double Horse" yarn. The purchase volumes of each guild are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong: 1,950 bales</p>
<p>Inland: 57 bales</p>

<p>Cotton Market Rises in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Rumors of Factories Offsetting Positions and Active Yarn Sales at the Same Time</p>
<p>Many Floating Longs Eager to Offset Positions in January</p>
<p>Buyers Highly Bullish</p>
<p>The cotton market was calm in the morning and suddenly rose in the afternoon. Xin Cheng bought in to cover short positions, and it was rumored that a certain factory was offsetting positions. At the same time, yarn sales were relatively active. It was verified that, excluding holidays, there were only 14 or 15 actual business days in January. Generally, floating short positions are short-term, and the situation is tight. Offsetting short positions is particularly urgent. As for buyers, they are particularly bullish due to the thin inventory of underwater goods. Therefore, the market sentiment is slightly higher, and buyers flock in.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rose by 0.035 to 0.045 Yuan</p>
<p>In the opening of the pre-market Zheng Biao, although the gold price reached a new high, American cotton was flat. The market situation in each month was very weak, falling by 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon, a major player covered short positions, and the market became very tight. Each month rose by 0.04 to 0.045 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 66,900 dan. It was verified that 12,700 dan were sold by Geng Feng, 1,700 dan by Ming De, 2,200 dan by Yi Chang, and 3,300 dan by Zhang Da. 4,000 dan were bought by Chang Cheng, 1,800 dan by Yuan Yu Xing, 2,000 dan by Yu Heng, 1,800 dan by Xie Sheng, 1,000 dan by Yi Feng, and 1,100 dan by Yuan Tai.

<p>American Cotton Flat and Weak, Indian Cotton Slightly Up</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was sluggish, and dealers watched. Futures rose or fell by 1 to 2 points. Spot goods did not move. British cotton was closed. The Indian cotton market was stable. Pingguoer and Bailuoxi rose by 2.25 rupees, and Aomula rose by 2.5 rupees.</p>

<p>Food: The Huangpu Rice Market Becomes Increasingly Weak</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 50 sources from various guilds. About 200 boats of Huangpu cargo were stockpiled. Due to light rain in the morning, few people visited the market. Transactions were minimal. Guest guilds purchased 700 to 800 dan. Prices continued to decline. The number of goods from the Dangxi guild was limited, and the opening gate was still thick. The opening price was set, and the Xiangzi guild was slightly lower by 0.05.</p>
<p>(New Gate) There was no activity in yesterday's market. Although river footers showed improvement, transactions were slightly lower in the early morning at various shops. Northern japonica was set at a high price, and secondary was weak. Early and late rice had limited fluctuations. The Du Jian from the port was extremely short of purchases from this city, and the Ningbo and Taizhou guilds in other ports had both purchased. About 40 vessels arrived in Shanghai from the western route. Fujian merchants continued to purchase Ke Xian.</p>
<p>Supply is Weak, Market Calls for Higher Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian was not strong. Fujian merchants were still active, and the market showed a firm trend. Prices showed a slight increase of 0.02 to 0.03. The supply of finished products was not large at the source, and costs increased. The water level in various places was dry, making transportation difficult and unprofitable. The arrival of goods gradually decreased. Therefore, landlords had excellent intentions and called for higher prices of 0.05, but landlords did not move. Northern guilds and some southern guilds changed to Du rice, and their purchasing appetite weakened. As a result, Gan Wan was slightly better by 0.02 to 0.03, and Xiang rice was strong. The Tong City market purchased 500 bags of Hunan engine oil at a price of 8.95 to 8.9 yuan. 519 bags of Jiangxi engine late rice were priced at 8.67 to 8.52 yuan. Soybean oil and miscellaneous grains were still active.</p>
<p>Local Factories Were the Main Purchasers</p>
<p>Guangdong and Ningbo Guilds Purchased the Next Most</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil and miscellaneous grain market continued to be active. Small Du beans were both tight and in high demand. The purchasing appetite remained strong, with local factories being the main purchasers, followed by Guangdong and then Ningbo guilds. Special Chong Lu beans were exclusively purchased by the Guangdong guild, with 10 cars of Xicheng Yuan beans and 500 bags of Andong Sand Yellow beans purchased for factories. In addition, 2 cars of Kaiyuan foreign large-grain Yuan beans, 200 bags of Pinghu Du beans, 600 bags of Pudong Du beans, and 500 bags of Yingdian special vegetable Lu beans, as well as 350 bags of Chong vegetable Lu beans, were all purchased by the Guangdong guild. However, the purchase of 150 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow beans belonged to the El guild. The collection market was flat, and 40 bags of Jiujiang black sesame were opened for sale and purchased by the El guild. Peanuts and peanut kernels were tight. 70 bags of Shuanggou peanuts, 250 bags of Xuzhou peanuts, and 240 bags of Qinhuangdao peanut kernels were all purchased by local guilds. The situation in the oil market was similar to before. Soybean oil was slightly weak, with only the price of the Lianqi oil from the boat falling by 0.05 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: A Large Batch of Artificial Silk Will Be Imported Soon</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the sales of artificial silk in inland silk factories have been active. In the past week, Chinese silk merchants purchased and transported 500 to 600 boxes of American artificial silk from inland areas. The inventory in Shanghai warehouses is gradually thinning. According to news from Italian merchants Yi Hua and other firms, the Italian post ship Huatuofan Te will import a large batch of British-made artificial silk to Shanghai, estimated at over 70 boxes.</p>
<p>Sales of Artificial Silk Are Active</p>
<p>The demand for artificial silk by inland silk weaving factories is gradually becoming active. The sales of Japanese artificial silk in Shanghai have affected the sales of European and American artificial silk, making it difficult to be as smooth as in previous years. Yesterday, silk weaving merchants from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places delivered 82 boxes of first and second-class futures for January and February from the United States, France, Italy, and Germany through the guild. Prices were increasingly firm.</p>
<p>Tunxi Zhenmei Tea Transactions Are Brisk</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms in the local tea market received telegrams from Morocco requesting Tunxi Gaozhuang Zhenmei green tea from the Yingzhuang Jinlong and Yihe firms. The firms purchased large quantities, and other firms also replenished their stocks. The total volume of transactions throughout the city was 1,500 Jin boxes, which was also extremely brisk. The Jinlong Zhun firm actively promoted Northern Gong-colored Zhenmei and issued a large number of telegrams to solicit business. The current inventory of Zhenmei on the market is approximately 12,000 boxes. Tea merchants generally believe that the amount of tea is extremely small and sales are not smooth. People are resuming their habit of trending firm.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated Sugar Rises Again with Gold Prices</p>
<p>Xinmiaoqing Was Reported to Be Rising Yesterday</p>
<p>The Trend After Opening Was Still Stable</p>

<p>Film Supplement Movie World Tidbits Tales from Paradise (Continued from the Previous Day) Bai The Bird of Paradise</p>
<h3>㈢ The Basis of the Plot and Mythology</h3>
<p>The narrative of "Tales from Paradise" can be said to be a kind of religious horror among uncivilized peoples. In Hawaii, in the realm of the uncivilized, both sexes can openly choose their mates. During the "Aiuoea" (Tua, the native great mating dance), adult women stand in a circle surrounded by young men. In the warm firelight and the pounding of drums, they sing songs of courtship with resounding voices, twisting in the grass skirt dance (Hula-Hula). In this state of embracing and restraint, their eyes are glowing and flushed. They dance towards each young man they admire, circling and twisting, until his passion has reached its peak. He then stands up, embraces her, and takes her to a secluded and deserted forest to cherish their partner.</p>
<p>However, even among the natives who openly choose their mates, there are strict "rules of intercourse" that weigh heavily between the sexes, especially on women.</p>
<p>If they believe in these prohibitions and pass them down through generations, the natives reassure themselves that they have not angered the gods, that the volcano will not erupt, and that all construction will not be destroyed. Conversely, the "scapegoat" who violates these prohibitions will, under the direction of the sorcerers (Tom toms), have to jump into the mouth of the volcano as a sacrifice, insufficient to atone for the sins of the entire race.</p>
<p>Hawaii was originally a place of serene beauty. The Kilauea volcano stands tall in the sky, 13,675 feet high. When it erupts, molten rock rolls down, and the ground boils everywhere. The sound is deafening, the ground shakes as if about to collapse, tsunamis occur, the earth cracks, and terror fills the entire bird island. The highest peak of Kilauea is the Halamanman crater. There are many myths about this crater in the local area. The most common is that the crater is the "Palace of Ten Thousand Fires," the residence of the volcano goddess Pele.</p>
<h3>㈣ The Filming Process and Other Matters</h3>
<p>In terms of production, "Tales from Paradise" is extravagant and realistic. The entire Hawaiian village was rented by director King Vidor for filming.</p>
<p>In this village, Dolores del Río and fifty beautiful Hawaiian girls, wearing grass skirts that revealed their plump bodies and adorned with garlands of fresh flowers, shyly covered their chests and danced the courtship dance. Thousands of natives served as actors, and over a hundred boats participated in a funeral procession.</p>
<p>Several extremely rare shots must be praised. The most important is the tsunami. The seawater is rushing and rapid. Joe MacClure swims in this torrent that plunges straight to the bottom of the sea. This is his struggle between life and death, although, surrounding him, are natives skilled in the water, just in case.</p>
<p>Joe MacClure not only performed this underwater stunt but also fought with a sea turtle weighing three hundred and ten pounds on the seabed.</p>
<p>Speaking of water, it reminds me of Dolores, and the scene of her bathing underwater, her beautiful and healthy body vaguely visible in the shallow water, as well as her shyness and embarrassment as she came ashore to grab cloth to cover herself, and her infatuation and recklessness in her first sweet kiss: and her...</p>
<p>The expression of love, the intoxicating allure, unrestrained, unconstrained by etiquette, arbitrarily displaying the pursuit and needs of both sexes, Dolores can indeed play it out without any scruples in the film. Dolores del Río and Joe MacClure co-star in the most passionate scene in "Tales from Paradise," filled with South Seas flavor.</p>

To Mr. Xiaoma: We regret that we cannot reply to all submissions that are not published; if you want to know the reason for non-publication, it is probably because of space constraints.

<p>Audience Opinions on "Two Northeastern Women" Ji Zhong</p>
<p>Since its promotion nearly a year ago, Tianyi Film Company's "Two War Orphans," set against the backdrop of the September 18th and January 28th Incidents, has been repeatedly hindered by the Nanjing Film Censorship Board and the concession authorities, and has never been publicly screened. Recently, due to the company's best efforts to lobby, it was able to meet the audience as "Two Northeastern Women." Now, I will offer my humble opinions.</p>
<h3>㈠ Thematic Aspect</h3>
<p>The theme is very conscious, and it can give us a powerful stimulus. Set against the backdrop of the September 18th and January 28th Incidents, it waves the flag and shouts, and is very capable of salvaging the dead conscience of the people. The reason why the concession authorities repeatedly obstructed it is precisely because it is rich in nationalistic sentiment. Therefore, from the perspective of the theme, it is indeed an absolute necessity for our endangered nation.</p>
<h3>㈡ Directing Aspect</h3>
<p>The director is Li Pingqian, who has now left Tianyi. In this film, we can clearly see that he has indeed been able to contribute his intelligence. For example, the flexibility of the layout, the compactness of the sub-scenes, especially those few lines of dialogue, such as a certain wounded soldier who has lost his left hand, but says he still has his right hand to fire a gun, and the recruitment of volunteers, where Sun Min, who plays the speaker, shouts loudly, "Those who do not want to be slaves of a subjugated nation, go and kill the enemy quickly."... Examples like these are too numerous to mention. Undoubtedly, the audience unknowingly receives countless stimulants.</p>
<h3>㈢ Acting Aspect</h3>
<p>Hu Shan's expression has improved a lot compared to "One Night of Luxury." When writing a letter to her imagined lover, her affectionate appearance is truly commendable. The newly joined Lu Lixia is also very competent. In the ward, recounting the past with pain, that kind of unbearable depressing mood is very passable. Ma Loufen feels a bit dull. There is no particularly satisfactory performance in the entire film.</p>
<h3>㈣ A Few Words</h3>
<p>The scenes of several wars are very good. The several scenes of hand-to-hand combat are also very realistic, but the lack of sound for the planes is a major flaw. The set of the streets is very simple. The temporary hospital only has six patients, which is too unrealistic. The lighting is still clear. The sound recording is not very sophisticated. The insertion of Ah Gui as a servant is still pleasing, but when he goes to the hotel with the young lady, he suddenly wears a Western suit, which is too out of character.</p>
<p>More Hollywood Kidnapping Cases Zi Yin</p>
<p>The stars are indeed wealthy, but in their hearts, they harbor fear towards all unfamiliar visitors. Their faces and actions are familiar to the public, and their residences are also difficult to conceal. When kidnappers come up with ideas, there are many opportunities. Moreover, many stars who are mothers are even more apprehensive and have to take proper precautions, given the tragic ending of the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. Many stars hire bodyguards to follow them day and night and protect their residences. Visitors are of mixed quality and difficult to distinguish, so they simply decline all. To be even more cautious, even the chauffeurs are often semi-bodyguards. For example, Norma Shearer's chauffeur and a bodyguard in plain clothes always fix their sharp eyes on Shearer's little son, which is a perfect example.</p>
<p>Movie Gossip Zhang Zhiyun and Ruan Lingyu Yin Si</p>
<p>A Funny Scene of an Unexpected Encounter</p>
<p>The love between movie star Zhang Zhiyun and tea merchant Tang Jishan has indeed developed a huge rift. They have long been separated, each not asking about the other. Ms. Zhang is skilled in socializing and has many friends. Recently, among her many male friends, she has been spending time with someone named Xiao Teng, going out and having fun together. Comparatively, they are the most intimate.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, they went to the Calla Lily Garden ballroom to dance. Under the dim lights, swaying shadows, and the wild rhythm of the melodious and pleasant music, they sat side by side, sipping tea and chatting intimately. When a piece of music ended and the electric candles shone brightly, the dancing couples took each other's arms and returned to their seats. Ms. Zhang suddenly discovered an unexpected encounter. Her eyes fixed on a couple sitting next to her.</p>
<p>In that instant, the atmosphere was tense to the extreme. Then, unexpectedly, everyone stood up, nodding and smiling - unnatural smiles.</p>
<p>"Let me introduce you! This is my wife, Ms. Zhang Zhiyun. This is my friend, Ms. Ruan Lingyu!" Tang Jishan said with a smile, introducing his dance partner Ms. Ruan to Ms. Zhang.</p>
<p>"Let me also introduce you - this is my husband, Mr. Tang Jishan. This is my friend, Mr. Xiao Teng!" Ms. Zhang said with a smile, her voice very soft.</p>
<p>Everyone had been introduced. Everyone laughed heartily for a while, expressing great pleasure.</p>
<p>This short play of an unexpected encounter between two major actresses was profoundly performed and wonderfully moving. It is a pity that it was not captured on "Kinetoscope" at the time for the enjoyment of the public. It is indeed a regrettable matter.</p>
<p>Contribution of Opinions on the Air Quality of Movie Theaters Xiao Ouyang</p>
<p>A group of people are confined in a movie theater with no ventilation on all sides, sitting for two or three hours before dispersing. But in fact, movie theaters are continuously showing films every day, so the entire theater can be said to be constantly filled with many people breathing. Therefore, the air quality of movie theaters must be regarded as a very important and worthy-of-study matter!</p>
<p>First, the capacity issue. We have to estimate how many tickets are sold and how much volume each person needs to breathe on average (within a certain period). Then, based on scientific methods, we can measure the necessary minimum volume of the movie theater, or simply limit the number of viewers based on the capacity of the movie theater!</p>
<p>Second, the ventilation issue. This is about how to introduce fresh air and expel foul air (carbon dioxide, etc.). In foreign countries, there are already installations for this, such as exhaust fans and ventilation systems, with further research.</p>
<p>Third, how to find ways to improve the poor air quality? This has a very important meaning for prohibiting smoking and eating snacks, as well as coughing and spitting.</p>
<p>In fact, in Shanghai's various theaters, there seems to be very little attention to air quality installations (the Cathay, Nanjing, and Paramount theaters have a few). Moreover, the irrationality of the theaters, their dark and valley-like atmosphere, vendors selling things at will, spitting at will, smoking at will, and all kinds of immoral behaviors are disgusting. In foreign countries, the government pays attention to and examines these aspects of "movie hygiene" and considers them very important issues. I hope that the movie theaters in our country will also take the time to properly rectify these issues!</p>
<p>Film Treatise "Ah! Help!" Chen Dabei</p>
<p>The unique practice of using sound to assist expression should still focus on the gradual and slow transition as the most important point. Because suddenly making a certain expression can be tried in front of a mirror by anyone who has not been trained. However, to advance and retreat gradually at will, and to be able to maintain a certain expression exactly the same for a certain number of seconds, requires long-term training. If someone who has absolutely no training can maintain any expression exactly the same for more than a minute without bursting out laughing like a rice sprinkler, that would truly be a genius that I have long sought and never seen.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, before I learned the method of independent practice and diligently cultivated myself, I was completely incapable of expressing myself. Although I often imitated this and that expression in front of the mirror occasionally, I was too embarrassed to perform in front of an audience. Therefore, I am convinced that the art of acting cannot be successful without diligent cultivation.</p>
<p>The eleventh form of expression practice is similar to the third form. However, the third form uses deep breathing to practice. This eleventh form requires the help of sound.</p>
<p>The student should first make an extremely angry expression between the eyebrows in the mirror, and then gradually relax the tense muscles, and the eyes become very surprised.</p>
<p>First, see how far you have achieved this expression. Then, forcefully shout out the sound of "Ah! Help!" Take a closer look at how much this expression has deepened. Then gradually fade this expression, as if you have realized your mistake, and that what startled you was just an illusion.</p>

<h3>Contents of the Japanese Military Reform Plan</h3>
<p>A Heavy Military Force Will Be Moved to Our Northeast</p>
<p>Intensifying Training for Junior and Mid-Level Officers</p>
<p>Weaponry to Strive for Scientific and Mechanized Approach</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 28th Dispatch: The Army Ministry, after deliberation by the 64th session of the Diet, yesterday announced the contents of the military preparedness improvement plan to be implemented from the next fiscal year. ㈠ Enhancement of troop strength in Manchuria; ㈠ Enhancement of supplementary education; ㈠ Improvement of emergency systems; ㈠ Consolidation of operational materials. The first item aims to maintain the security of Manchuria in accordance with the clauses of the Japan-Manchuria Protocol, maintaining the necessary troop strength in Manchuria. The current dispatched troops are based on peacetime formations, and although the number of groups is large, their strength cannot match the strategic deployment, causing many inconveniences. Therefore, although the number of groups will not increase much in the next fiscal year, the content of each group will be enhanced, and the number of technical units such as aircraft, automobiles, tanks, heavy artillery, railways, and communications will be increased relatively, so that they can carry out difficult security maintenance tasks in vast and remote areas. The troops remaining in the homeland will be drastically reduced or even abolished, to focus on maintaining strategic readiness in that area. The second item is to cultivate the personnel necessary for the increase of new-style units due to the improvement of equipment. In peacetime, personnel from other troops and officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers who have already received education in their hometowns will be given necessary education for a specific period in case of emergency. The third item is mostly a military system reform plan, and the most urgent measures are to increase the number of officer students to enrich the lower-level cadres, to establish a short-term volunteer officer system to supplement the shortage of junior lieutenants, and to increase special warrant officers and revise the officer candidate system. The fourth item is based on the improvement and enhancement of equipment, and the content corresponding to the results of the above-mentioned military preparedness improvement is the improvement of various military supplies such as weapons, clothing, food, hygiene materials, and veterinary materials. Particular emphasis is placed on the improvement and maintenance of weapons and ammunition such as heavy and light machine guns, light rifles, heavy artillery, and anti-aircraft guns, as well as new-style equipment such as aircraft, tanks, and automobiles, and gas protection equipment. Therefore, 87.85 million yuan will be needed for the next fiscal year. From the ninth fiscal year onwards, depending on the changes in the financial situation, an increase will be requested. This kind of equipment improvement can both help small and medium-sized industrialists and promote industry in times of depression for the purpose of rectifying the current situation.

<h3>Will Adopt a Pro-Agriculture Policy</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented from January Next Year</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Moscow, 27th Dispatch: When the Second Five-Year Plan is implemented starting next week, "gradual progress" will be its slogan. According to a statement announced by the authorities today, all radical industrial activities will be slowed down.

However, the Second Five-Year Plan will pay more attention to agriculture, and it is expected that the standard of living will increase by three or two times. As for the achievements of the Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan, the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom, and it is not easy to make a fair judgment.</p>
<p>Gandhi Released Indefinitely</p>
<h3>Plans to Fast Again for the Untouchables on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>▲ Havas, Bodie, India, 28th Dispatch: Gandhi plans to start fasting again from January 1, but the general public still hopes that Gandhi can cancel the fast after a general vote is held by Hindus around the famous Guravayur Temple. The purpose of this vote is to decide whether to allow untouchables to enter the temple. Since Gandhi was arrested and detained in Yeravda Prison, it has been nearly a year. The issue of Gandhi's release is now more urgent than before. The Third Round Table Conference of the British and Indians has just ended. Because this conference took a compromise form, rumors of Gandhi's imminent release are rampant. However, according to observations from responsible parties, there are many reservations. The Governor-General of India recently declared that he cannot consider releasing Gandhi until Gandhi completely severs relations with the leaders of the non-cooperation movement. It is generally said that the government does not seem to be prepared to change its attitude.</p>
<p>France's Overdue Debt</p>
<h3>The US Insists on Payment</h3>
<p>To Start New Negotiations</p>
<p>Democratic Members Advocate Allowing the Use of Silver to Repay Debt</p>
<p>Roosevelt Will Send a Special Envoy to Europe to Inquire About Opinions</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 27th Dispatch: Secretary of State Stimson declared to the press that the US government intends to insist on the following: before any negotiations begin, France must first pay the debt due on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Washington, 27th Dispatch: French Ambassador to the United States Claudel, having received the latest instructions from the French government, met with Secretary of State Stimson at 11:20 this morning to explain France's position on the war debt issue. Claudel seemed to have stated that although France wanted to negotiate war debts with the United States, given the current political situation, the French government believed that suspending consultations for the time being would be better. American officials interpreted this matter as the result of differences in political views between the outgoing and incoming presidents of the United States. Before the inauguration of the new President Roosevelt on March 4 next year, negotiations on the war debt issue will also come to an end.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 27th Dispatch: Democratic Senator Hayden issued a radio speech today, advocating that the United States should allow Britain to use 100 million ounces of silver to repay 100 million yuan of debt, but with the following conditions: ㈠ Britain must purchase 100 million ounces of silver at the same time to restore its former silver-containing currency; ㈡ Britain must guarantee that India's sale of silver to other governments is only for minting purposes.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 27th Dispatch: The Chicago Tribune Paris edition published today that US President-elect Roosevelt will send a special envoy to Europe to inquire about the opinions of key government figures in France, Britain, and Italy on the war debt issue. The candidate has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>The South African Government</p>
<h3>Decides to Maintain the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>The Prime Minister Has No Intention to Resign</p>
<p>Preparing to Face Parliament</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Pretoria, 27th Dispatch: The South African Federal Government has decided not to abandon the gold standard, but according to the Emergency Act of 1931, it will recover gold coins circulating in the market and try to prevent the outflow or hoarding of gold coins. The government believes that this method does not conflict with the maintenance of the gold standard. Prime Minister Hertzog has no intention of resigning. He will face Parliament and declare a party war to resist Mr. Roos, a former cabinet member who has now resigned. The content of the cabinet discussions is unknown, but political circles speculate that a minority of members advocate resignation. The atmosphere is now slightly calmer. It is heard that Hertzog has decided to convene National Party members to unanimously support the government. Former Prime Minister Smuts and former cabinet member Roos will both deliver speeches tomorrow, which the general public is eager to hear. The Ministry of Finance has now issued a statement, according to the Financial Emergency Act of 1931, allowing banks not to be responsible for paying paper money in cash first. Exchange rates must be determined by silver in accordance with the regulations.</p>
