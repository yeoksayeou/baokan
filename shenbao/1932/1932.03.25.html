<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c1">告今日從事政治運動者㈠彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>處今日國難重重局面之下。國人本「天下興亡。匹夫有責」之義。於是努力從事於所謂政治運動者。乃應時而起。吾人就當前之事實而試予分析。則可知今日之從事政治運動者。雖其形式上皆以共赴國難爲出發點。但各有其立塲與本質。槪分述如次。</p>
<p>一曰舊軍閥官僚政客也。自國民黨底定全國以後。一部分投機之舊軍閥官僚政客。依然度其政治上優越之生涯。寖且儼然爲現政府之要角。惟尚有一部分迄今不得於現政府。失意枯坐。久已滿懷抑鬱。際此時會。乃視爲不可</p>
<p>復得之機。而羣起活動。昭示國民之主張。固無不日以國家與人民之利益爲前提。集其臭味相投之類。組織政黨。企圖捲土重來。向國民黨問鼎之輕重。以分得一杯政治之美羮。</p>
<p>吾人認爲國民有聞問政治之神聖權力。固不容少数人所把持壟斷。昔日之軍閥官僚政客。亦爲今日之國民。故從事於政治活動。吾人固不能謂其非是。然而今日民衆之所耍求。不在口頭上之主張。亦不在紙頭上之宣言。而在於救國之誠意。政治之臧否。視其合乎人民之利益興否而定論。民視最明。民聽最聰。能眞實代表人民利益者。乃眞能博得人民之擁護。否則甜言蜜語。雖能掩蔽人民之聰明於一時。終當爲其偉力所粉碎。過往史蹟歷歷具在。即如國民黨當北伐之始。以其眞能代表人民之利益。人民乃簞食壺漿以迎。備受熱烈之擁護。乃不久軍閥政治官僚政治復興。政治日趨於黑暗。自然漸失人民之信仰。吾人敢問今日之舊軍閥官僚政客。果有絕大之覺悟乎。昔日之頭腦果能接受時代思潮之洗禮乎。其活動之動機。果眞爲解除人民之困厄乎。其主張。其行動。果能以大衆之利益爲依歸乎。如其不能。則其結果其前途究如何。歷史未必許一再復演其舊劇。吾人敢正告今日從事政治活動之舊軍閥官僚政客者。愼勿以爲「混水中好摸魚。」人民長可欺罔。而日爲自己掘墳墓也。覆轍未遠。曷速回頭。</p>

<p>今晨仍繼續開會</p>
<p>上海停戰乃日本撤兵問題、中日乃關係國代表、昨在英總領事館舉行正式會議、兩次討論六小時之久、因日方提出便衣隊問題、討論甚久、以致其他重要問題未乃討論、故昨日會議、雖稱稍有進步、實未獲得具體結果、約定今晨十時、繼續開會、</p>
<h3 id="c3">出席代表 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>

<p>昨午第一次會議畢、各代表先後出、英藍使稱經過順利、日使重光謂第一次會議尚無具體决定、重要關鍵在午後第二次會議、昨晩第二次會議畢、即發表簡單公報、宣稱討論實行停戰、大體問題稍有進步、惟尚無結果云云、詢之郭次長及日使重光是否樂觀、郭氏答稱、渠生而樂觀者、重光答曰、唯唯、本報記者昨夜更從外交　　　　、中日雙方經過數度非正式會議、巳根據三項基本原則、成立停戰草約、昨日正式會議、逐條討論、修正字句、字義斟酌、費時甚久、更以日方態度枝枝節節臨時提出許多問題、以致進行非常遲緩、昨晨第一次會議、首先討論停戰草約緒言、繼即討英領署停戰會議攝影</p>
<p>論第一條中國軍隊暫時留駐現在防線、將中國軍隊所駐地點、一一確定、至此、日方提出取締便衣隊問題、要求載入停戰條約、戴司今當予駁覆、否認我軍有便衣隊、故便衣隊問題、實無載入停戰條約之理由、雙方對便衣隊問題、討論甚久、第一次會議、遂無結果、午後二次會議、繼續討論便衣隊問題、直至五時、仍無結果、遂將此問題擱置、進行討論停戰條約本文、</p>
<h3 id="c5">今晨續議 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>昨日會議、以時間不及、故最重要之第二條日軍依照一定之程序撤退、及第三條組織共同委員會等等、均未提及討論、約定今晨十時開第三次會議、據外交界消息、此項會議、尚須經過若干時日、方得結束、至外傳日本堅持撤退至吳淞及淞滬路以東一帶區域、據外交當局稱、日方迄未有此提議、至日方要求撤退區域、由國際警察維持治安一節、日方確有此提議、惟已根本打銷、撤退區域、現决定由我方保安隊或特别警察維持治安、</p>

<p>本星期三之工部局董事會、已批准一九三二年度之預算草案、及所附三月十八日財政委員會之按語、財務處於提出此草案時、聲明係照費唐法官之主張、於董事選舉之前、提交委員會之手、</p>
<p>上年九月時、該處長曾預料恐有巨額虧短、幸匯率改善、及各處勸行緊縮、故仍能得有三五一、○○○兩盈餘之結果、又因局中所負之債、均已有辦法、故可將若干經常支出改歸於資本支出也、</p>
<p>查一九三二年經常支出、共達一五、五○○、○○○兩、但敎育費另計、各處之數、大致皆較上年爲少、但不致妨及公務、即如工務處、即比去年减少二六○、八七○兩、係將某某項經常費歸人臨時費、此項辦法、已經查賬員認爲合理、至敎育費之别立預算、亦爲工務經費减少之因、關於局中之音樂隊、已經竭力减削經費、將來或更須再减、惟以後所開之音樂會、似應採較爲普通之秩序單、俾收費加多可以抵當設備之費、又局中之方針、以本地僱用之隊員代替、外洋所僱、亦應勸行</p>
<p>財務處之預算、略同於上年、有兩高級職員之缺、尚未計議補人、如此、本年内或須提升兩華籍職員、並加用相當之助辦一員、至於捐務部</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>部分、現亦併入財務處預算之中、其數目所以略</p>
<p>增、乃因提升出力之高級職員之故、爱倫君之酬金、已列於普通用費之中、</p>
<p>總辦處經費、約爲三二五、○○○兩、較去年略少、法律部八九、○○○兩、較去年多十分之二、係因自然之增長、及助理律師之辦公改良辦法已經批准者、華文處擬添助辦一人、尚待董事會之核准、情報處預算約四五、○○○兩、係第一次見於預算、又普通用費項下、比去年减少許多、乃因無甚特别用費、如上年之費唐報告、希爾報告、與薪俸委員會之類也、</p>
<p>經主席之詢問、該處長又稱、防止绑票會之補助費二萬兩、該會大約即將請領、所有局中補助之機關、應於編製預算之前、以前一年之用項、開送來局、請領本年補助金、否則甚爲不便、</p>
<p>關於利息佣金等之項下、向以電力公司未付之欵之利息爲巨數、該公司已照約按期付欵、已經局中用於投資事業、此數今已大减矣、</p>
<p>預算中收入項目、编製在本埠事變之前、今年總捐及公用事業之短收、究將達若干、無法預料、故只可仍其原數、另作彌補之計、地税一項、較一九三一所列爲少、蓋爲不收税之地產預留地步、市政捐及特捐、列數較大、因市政之自然發展、及將减捐免捐之額列入之故、至减免之數、已另開於支出項下矣、</p>
<p>碼頭捐估計較上年少十五萬兩、乃因與鄰區之分配比例略有變更、又近日貨物漸多由浦東卸下、故本局頗蒙損失、</p>
<p>公用事業及局營事業之項下、自來水股票之陸續購入者、已列於「利息」類、歸爲投資、以其與他項投資並無區别、又有二八七·四四○兩之數、歸入特别收入及支出、</p>
<p>至於目前戒嚴事態、將需欵若干、不能確知、惟已在普通收入項下少列四十萬兩、又於特别支出項下加列八十萬兩、此已將减收捐税之數計入、但斯項化費應分歸數年分攤也、</p>
<p>在普通收入項下加列之一、二二五·○○○兩、此乃因極力緊縮之後、仍不能以現行捐額使預算平衡、過去數年中、局中始購入若干地皮、超過各處所需、此辦法自不欲更改、因投資之合宜之故、今所列之數、即係預期由售地可得之餘利、此數適略等於百分之二三、市政捐九個月之數、將此數加於一四、三一二·○○○兩之經常收入、乃得有約一萬一千兩之盈餘、</p>
<p>特别預算之支出、凡約一八、九一六·○○○兩、内列各項、已經各處審閲、並經會同工務處長斟酌修正、内由上年移來之虧額爲五一六、三○○○兩、較預計超過十六萬餘、乃因修路工作加緊之故、</p>
<p>讑及特别收入、電力公司本年應付一千六百萬兩、内以八百萬償還一九二二之公債、其餘則供投資及基金之用、又於此列入二百萬之收入、於必要時、當舉行募債、或以他法籌出、如非必要、仍應避免募債、或可與持券人之董事部通融二百萬、或向銀行透支此數幾個月、以待電力公司之下批付欵、總計特别收入約一千九百萬兩、除支約餘八萬四千兩、</p>
<p>敎育預算之内、收入列一·三八四·○九○兩、約當市政總捐及地税之百分之一·七四、又學校補助費一項、係初次列於此預算之中、</p>
<p>某董事聲稱、外僑學校補助費、上年未發、本待與華人學校同發、後者因與華當局未商妥而停頓、前者不應因之而受影響、此議經通過、即由財務處長照辦、</p>
<p>又某董稱、預算内有數校、已受特别補助、又經免捐、今若又另得補助金、則每校究得若干利益、不免混淆、財務處長荅稱、各項補助費如不統一、則分别頗難、此事當另行報告、或於下年預算得以分清也、</p>
<p>關於特别支出之敎育項下·五三九·四三○兩、係由總預算移出、此法可使市民之主張增加或減削敎育費者、皆知每年之敎育費究爲若干、亦可助董事會、便能决定繼續供給此項政策之可能與否、</p>
<p>該處長又聲稱、本年市政捐不增、完全係因戒嚴狀態、使納税人難於擔負之故、惟渠意地皮擔負之捐額尚欠公允、爲增加收入以供局用計、仍主張照前定辦法、將地價重行估計也、</p>

<h3 id="e1">A Word to Today's Political Activists (I) Bin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Amidst the current situation of profound national crisis, our countrymen, adhering to the principle of "everyone is responsible for the fate of the nation," are striving to engage in what is called political movements. This has arisen in response to the times. If we analyze the current situation, we can see that although all those engaged in political movements today take jointly overcoming the national crisis as their starting point, they each have their own stance and nature. A general description is as follows:</p>
<p>First, there are the old warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians. After the Kuomintang established national stability, some opportunistic old warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians continued their privileged political lives, and even became important figures in the current government. However, there are still some who have not been successful under the current government, sitting idly in disappointment, filled with resentment for a long time. Seizing this opportunity, they regard it as an opportunity not to be missed and rise up to take action. The propositions they proclaim to the people invariably take the interests of the nation and the people as their premise. They gather those of like mind, organize political parties, and attempt to make a comeback, questioning the Kuomintang's weight, in order to obtain a share of the political pie.</p>
<p>We believe that the people have the sacred right to be involved in politics, which should not be monopolized by a few. The former warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians are also citizens today, so we cannot say that it is wrong for them to engage in political activities. However, what the people demand today is not verbal propositions or declarations on paper, but sincerity in saving the country. The merits of politics are determined by whether they conform to the interests of the people. The people's eyes are sharp, and their ears are keen. Those who can truly represent the interests of the people can truly win the support of the people. Otherwise, sweet words may be able to deceive the people's intelligence for a time, but will eventually be shattered by their great power. The historical records of the past are vividly present. Just as when the Kuomintang began the Northern Expedition, because it could truly represent the interests of the people, the people welcomed them with food and drink and gave them enthusiastic support. However, soon the warlord politics and bureaucratic politics revived, and politics became increasingly dark, naturally gradually losing the people's faith. We dare to ask, do today's old warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians have a great awakening? Have their past minds been able to accept the baptism of the trends of the times? Is the motivation for their activities truly to relieve the people's distress? Are their propositions and actions based on the interests of the masses? If not, what will be the result and the future? History may not allow the old drama to be repeated again. We dare to solemnly tell the old warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians engaged in political activities today: Be careful not to think that "it is good to fish in troubled waters." The people can be deceived forever, and they are digging their own graves day by day. The past is not far away, why not turn back quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Yesterday's Formal Ceasefire Conference <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Two meetings were held, morning and afternoon</p>
<p>Japan raised the issue of plainclothes troops</p>
<p>Resulting in little progress in the conference</p>
<p>The meeting continued this morning</p>
<p>The issue of Shanghai ceasefire is related to the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Representatives from China and Japan, related countries, held a formal meeting at the British Consulate General yesterday. After two discussions lasting six hours, the Japanese side raised the issue of plainclothes troops, which was discussed for a long time, so other important issues were not discussed. Therefore, yesterday's meeting, although said to have made some progress, did not achieve concrete results. It was agreed to continue the meeting at ten o'clock this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Attending Representatives <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The first formal ceasefire meeting was held at 10:00 AM and ended at 12:45 PM. The second meeting was held from 3:00 PM to 6:25 PM. The attending representatives were: Chief Chinese Representative, Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi; Military Representative, Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji;</p>
<p>Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army, Huang Qiang; translator Guo Dehua; and Yin Rugeng; aide Zhang. The Chief Japanese Representative was originally scheduled to be Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu, but was temporarily replaced by the Commander of the 9th Division, Kenkichi Ueda. Military representatives: Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army, Waniichiro Tashiro; Chief of Staff of the Navy, Shigetaro Shimada; translators: Ide Hayashi and Okazaki; aides: Mizuno, Kita, and Abe. On the side of the countries concerned: British Minister Lampson; American Minister Johnson; Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano; French Minister Wilden, who was absent due to illness, was represented by Boudet, Counselor of the French Embassy. Naval attachés of various countries were not present. The seating arrangement was in a T-shape, with the American Minister, the Italian Chargé d'Affaires, and the French representative sitting at the top. On both sides, the British Minister sat at the head of the right side, followed by the Chinese delegation; on the left side, the Chinese Secretary of the British Embassy, Tai Ximan, sat at the head, serving as the recorder, followed by the Japanese delegation. The Chinese and Japanese translators sat separately at two tables. A Japanese plane suddenly appeared at the start of the meeting at 10:00 AM, soaring in the airspace of the British Consulate, flying very low, and then flying towards Pudong.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Meeting Content <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>After the first meeting yesterday afternoon, the representatives left one after another. British Minister Lampson said that the progress was smooth. Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu said that the first meeting had not yet made any concrete decisions, and the key was the second meeting in the afternoon. A simple communiqué was issued after the second meeting last night, declaring that the discussion on the implementation of the ceasefire had made some progress on the general issues, but there were still no results. When asked if Vice Minister Guo and Ambassador Shigemitsu were optimistic, Guo replied that he was born an optimist, and Shigemitsu replied, "Yes, yes." According to the reporters of this newspaper, after several informal meetings between China and Japan, a draft ceasefire agreement has been established based on three basic principles. At yesterday's formal meeting, the articles were discussed one by one, and the wording and meaning were carefully considered, which took a long time. Moreover, the Japanese side raised many temporary issues in a piecemeal manner, which made the progress very slow. At the first meeting yesterday morning, the preamble to the ceasefire draft agreement was discussed first, and then the first article, "Chinese troops will temporarily remain on the current defense line," was discussed, and the locations where the Chinese troops were stationed were determined one by one. At this point, the Japanese side raised the issue of suppressing plainclothes troops, demanding that it be included in the ceasefire treaty. Commander Dai Ji immediately refuted this, denying that the Chinese army had plainclothes troops. Therefore, there was no reason to include the issue of plainclothes troops in the ceasefire treaty. The two sides discussed the issue of plainclothes troops for a long time, and the first meeting was inconclusive. At the second meeting in the afternoon, the discussion on the issue of plainclothes troops continued until 5:00 PM, but there was still no result. The issue was then shelved, and the discussion of the text of the ceasefire treaty continued.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Continued Discussion This Morning <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's meeting did not have enough time, so the most important Article 2, "Japanese troops will withdraw according to a certain procedure," and Article 3, "The establishment of a joint committee," etc., were not mentioned for discussion. It was agreed to hold the third meeting at 10:00 AM this morning. According to diplomatic sources, this meeting will take some time to conclude. As for the rumors that Japan insists on withdrawing to the area east of Wusong and the Songhu Road, the diplomatic authorities said that the Japanese side has not yet made this proposal. As for the Japanese request that the area to be withdrawn be maintained by international police, the Japanese side did make this proposal, but it has been completely rejected. It is now decided that the area to be withdrawn will be maintained by our security forces or special police.</p>

<p>Vice Minister Guo said that the outside world did not understand the truth of the negotiations and there were many misunderstandings. The other day, the Central Committee members stationed in Shanghai held a meeting, and Vice Minister Guo attended to report, and they were very understanding. Guo also plans to invite the chief editors of various newspapers to explain the content of the negotiations in the next few days. Also, at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Paramount Pictures of the United States filmed the meeting representatives. British Minister Lampson introduced the Chinese and Japanese representatives, and the Chinese and Japanese representatives introduced the military representatives respectively. Finally, Vice Minister Guo also gave a simple speech to the radio, saying that the Japanese army had come from afar, and now he hoped that the Chinese and Japanese representatives could get closer to each other, so that the ceasefire conference could be completed successfully.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Compilation of Frontline Information <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>

<p>Had a Sincere Conversation with Zhu Ziqiao Yesterday</p>
<p>Received Representatives of Over a Hundred Organizations This Morning</p>
<p>The following is a compilation of the news about the actions of the League of Nations Inquiry Team yesterday and everything before leaving Shanghai:</p>
<h3 id="e9">Hangzhou Representatives Come to Shanghai to Welcome <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Various organizations in Hangzhou previously sent representatives Lin Die, Shen Naizheng, and Zhang Yinian to Shanghai to welcome the League of Nations Inquiry Team. The three gentlemen went to the Cathay Hotel to pay a visit at around 7:00 PM last night. They were received by Sir Lytton, who asked in detail about the situation of Japanese planes disturbing Hangzhou, and talked for about half an hour before they took their leave. In addition to handing over to Sir Lytton a letter of opinion from various organizations in Hangzhou with official seals, Mr. Lin and others also carried a list of Japanese aircraft flying over Hangzhou, damage photos, and other evidence for the reference of the Inquiry Team.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Mr. Zhu Qinglan Paid a Visit Yesterday Morning <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, a representative of charitable organizations, went to the Cathay Hotel at 10:30 AM yesterday morning to visit the Inquiry Team. Mr. Zhu spoke in Mandarin, which was translated by Chen Liting. He made a statement to Sir Lytton, saying: I have served as an official in Shandong Province for 30 years. Based on my experience in politics, I feel that the Japanese have been deliberately plotting to seize our Shandong Province, which can be divided into three main points: 1. The Japanese aggression in Shandong Province. What they want is to seize and manage it. By the time we repeatedly negotiate with them, what has been seized is no longer ours, such as the Fushun Coal Mine, which is still a Sino-Japanese pending case. 2. The Japanese economic power in the three northeastern provinces is completely taking control. Foreigners are not allowed to invest, and Chinese are not allowed to invest. The investment rights are almost exclusively held by the Japanese. For example, the Jinhui Railway, where American investment was rejected. The Japanese criticize the Chinese for being xenophobic, but in fact, there is no greater and more severe xenophobic force in our Shandong Province than the Japanese. 3. The Japanese have firm and affirmative propositions, destroying the integrity of our country's politics, such as the Northern Expeditionary Army being blocked when it advanced to Jinan, which led to the May 3rd Tragedy, and then bombing Zhang Zuolin and threatening Zhang Xueliang, not allowing the Qing Tian Bai Ri flag to be hung, etc. There are too many examples to enumerate. Later, the Inquiry Team raised a question, saying that the Japanese side strongly stated that China extremely hindered the development of transportation by Japan in Shandong Province. Have you (referring to Zhu Ziqiao) also heard about it? Mr. Zhu said that it is true. For example, the Jihui Railway, which the Japanese side called developing the economy of Shandong Province, actually had other intentions. If you look at the textbook printed by the Ministry of Transportation of Japan in Showa 4, there is a lesson on the expansion of Japanese power in the three northeastern provinces, and you can understand everything. In short, the Japanese are deliberately destroying peace in East Asia in order to monopolize the three northeastern provinces, which is an undeniable fact. I hope that the gentlemen of the Inquiry Team can impartially report all the facts to the League of Nations in order to seek a fair judgment from the world. Finally, Sir Lytton asked Mr. Zhu if he had any other opinions to contribute to the League of Nations on this kind of behavior by the Japanese. Mr. Zhu replied that we no longer trust the Japanese. Therefore, unless the Japanese army withdraws all its troops in China to show its sincerity to the world, we will never believe that it has the sincerity of peace. We firmly believe that the League of Nations will eventually overcome tyranny, so we rely on the League of Nations to solve our problems. Finally, I have one more word to tell you, that is, the people who invaded our country by the Japanese army were all those who had served as officials in our country, such as advisors and the like. During the conversation, all the members of the Inquiry Team paid special attention.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Several British Missionaries Visited <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, several British missionaries went to the Cathay Hotel to talk with the League of Nations Inquiry Team, roughly stating the cruelty of the Japanese army's atrocities and that there was no need for the Japanese army to send troops at all this time, because Shanghai would never endanger the safety of Japanese residents, etc., in detail. They left at 10:30 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Representatives of Organizations Will Visit This Morning <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association of this city, the Joint Federation of Commercial Circles of Various Roads, the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, the China National Salvation Association, the Joint Federation of National Salvation Associations of Various Organizations, and the cultural and business circles of this city, more than a hundred organizations, because the League of Nations Inquiry Team will leave Shanghai tomorrow morning, yesterday, they specially asked Mr. Ren Jinpin to go to the Chinese representative office at the Cathay Hotel to discuss the formalities for visiting the League of Nations Inquiry Team. They were received by Mr. Wang Licun, and it was agreed that this morning, representatives of more than a hundred organizations, Jiang Junyi, Hu Yongqi, Ren Jinpin, etc., would go to the residence of the Inquiry Team to state their hopes for the team and submit a detailed letter of opinion on the Japanese army's invasion of the Northeast before and after the invasion of Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e13">National Salvation Association Sends a Telegram to the Inquiry Team <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The National Salvation Association of the Republic of China sends a telegram to the League of Nations Inquiry Team, Sir Lytton of the United Kingdom, Major General McCoy of the United States, General Claude of France, Count Mako de of Italy, and Dr. Hini of Germany: This time, our country, with an excessive degree of peaceful tolerance, has failed to resolve the excessive aggression of Japan, which has caused you gentlemen to travel a long distance, which we are deeply ashamed of. You gentlemen are entrusted by the League of Nations with heavy responsibilities, which are not only related to peace in East Asia, but also related to the future safety of mankind in the world. Therefore, the people of our country have a warm welcome and a faithful contribution, which is very meaningful. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has used the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese to invade and occupy Liaoning and Jilin, and recently has used the pretext of resisting goods to invade and occupy Songhu. On the one hand, it uses diplomatic means to deceive the League of Nations, and on the other hand, it uses active policies to annex China. The League of Nations has been repeatedly deceived, and our country has been very tolerant, but Japan still does not know how to wake up, and directly regards the League of Nations as a child's play. If our country does not exist, people will inevitably be too arrogant. Our association now has four points to contribute as follows: 1. The number of Japanese overseas businessmen in China is not small. I would like to ask, what major damage has been done over the years? If compared with the harm done to our country's residents in various parts of Korea, what action should our country take against Japan? Moreover, the process of each tragedy was caused by Japan sending troops to China, and our country has never sent troops to Japan. This should be paid attention to. 2. The people of our country, in view of the innocent killing of our compatriots in Shandong Province and the innocent destruction of our products, have inspired the conscience of our country's people to save the country and save themselves, and therefore have a passive expression of resisting Japanese goods, which is completely caused by Japan's oppression by violence. No matter what country, when it is in danger of extinction, can it not allow such a minimum degree of resistance? Moreover, there is freedom of trade, and it has never been heard that people are forced to buy and sell by violence. Even our country's government has no possibility of interfering in the people's patriotic movement in law. If Japan can abolish its cruel oppression, then our country's patriotic movement will naturally stop. This should be paid attention to. 3. I have heard that the roads in Shandong Province and the Zhabei area of Shanghai have been changed by Japan. If it is not preparing to implement the occupation of land, why do this? The ambition of Japan's mainland is booming, and the world is aware of it. If our country takes a part of the land as the basis for its expansion, I am afraid that after a few years, the allied countries will also be harmed. The interests are related, not only to our country. This should be paid attention to. 4. All the people of our country are happy to hear about the ongoing peace talks. However, the attitude of the people of our country is to hope that Japan will first withdraw its troops and that the cases of Shandong, Shanghai, and Korea will be resolved at the same time in order to achieve true peace and justice. If our country's government surrenders to Japan's local treaty, and the future troubles cannot be eliminated, then not only will the 400 million people of our country never recognize it, but it will also violate the League of Nations' claim to justice and the purpose of your coming from afar. This should be paid attention to. The above four points are all events worthy of attention. Our association has a long history and holds a fair claim. We offer our contribution with 120,000 sincerity, and we hope that you gentlemen will base your mission of investigation, uphold justice, redress right and wrong, and make the implementation of the League of Nations' resolution open a new path to world peace. We pray to the highest degree. National Salvation Association of the Republic of China Kowtows, Seal.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Special Flower Cars at the South Station Are Waiting for Seats <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The first group of the League of Nations Inquiry Team, Sir Lytton and 17 others, are scheduled to travel from Shanghai to Beijing by boat on the 26th of this month. The second group of five committee members, 16 secretaries and attendants, will travel from Shanghai to Hangzhou by car on the same day and transfer to Beijing. Our side has been preparing to welcome them separately. For the part going to Hangzhou, Zheng Baozhao, the director of the traffic department of the Two-Route Administration, ordered Zhong Wenjiang, the chief of the South Station traffic section, to take care of them at that time, and specially prepared a special car to go to Hangzhou, with a flower car, a first-class car, and a first- and second-class car, a total of one train, parked at the South Station, waiting for the scheduled departure. The special car has been prepared by the Hangzhou Station yesterday and will be sent to Shanghai today to be parked at the South Station for application.</p>

<p>Zhang Xiaolin, a Shanghai gentleman and merchant in Hangzhou, and Yu Yefeng, the former commander of the Zhejiang Water Police, and eight others, took the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road No. 38 express train to Hangzhou at 3:20 PM yesterday to contact local officials and businessmen to prepare for all the welcome matters after the League of Nations Inquiry Team arrives in Hangzhou and make arrangements in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Dehe and Jiangxin Two Rounds for差 <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Sir Lytton and others took the Dehe Wheel to Beijing. Later, because the Japanese side also had 12 representatives traveling to Beijing on the same wheel, and other parties also had accompanying personnel, the wheel cabin was not enough. Yesterday, it was rented to the China Merchants Bureau Jiangxin Wheel Ship to reserve cabins for the rest of the personnel to ride. Both wheels have prepared everything.</p>
<p>Japanese Attempt</p>
<h3 id="e17">To Seize Customs Duties of the Three Northeastern Provinces <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiter Suzhou and Hangzhou Every Day</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing Reports to the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yan Huiqing, the chief Chinese representative to the League of Nations, informed the League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond today that the Japanese are now planning to seize the customs duties of the three northeastern provinces, sending Japanese as advisors, and demanding that the customs duties be handed over to the puppet government. He is now instructed to lodge a serious protest, and the Chinese government will never recognize the legitimacy of this action. Dr. Yan also said that Japan, disregarding the resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council and Parliament, is now gradually completing the annexation of the three northeastern provinces. He also said that, according to the report of the magistrate of Suzhou County on March 21, Japanese planes were surveying Suzhou City every day, and on March 20, planes equipped with machine guns attacked the Hangzhou Railway Station. Although most of the representatives in Geneva are now elsewhere, the Chinese representative Dr. Yan and the Japanese representative Sato are still here during the Easter period. Sato has rented a house and plans to live here during the Disarmament Conference. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today firmly denied Dr. Yan Huiqing's claim in Geneva that the Japanese occupied the customs of the three northeastern provinces, and said that the informal representative of the Shanghai Customs Administration is now going to the three northeastern provinces to discuss customs tax collection issues. As for the tax collected by the Dalian Customs, Japan will still transfer it to Shanghai to wait for further agreement. Before the Manchurian government is formally recognized, it will never be allowed to use the customs duties. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Song Ziwen's Statement <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Denies Protesting to League of Nations Investigators</p>
<p>National News Agency said that Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi stated yesterday that a news agency in Geneva reported that the Chinese representative sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on March 19, stating that it had received a telegram from Song, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, stating that the stay of the League of Nations Investigation Team in Shanghai should not be extended, and that the Chinese government could not approve of the team changing its attitude, etc. I would like to declare the following:</p>
<p>Seeing in the newspaper this morning that China protested to the League of Nations about the investigation team's slow arrival in Manchuria, I was deeply shocked. China did not have any instructions to send to Dr. Yan Huiqing, ordering him to protest the investigation team's attitude on any issue, and even less did it want to protest its short stay in Shanghai to receive the welcome of all circles. I have already telegraphed the Chinese delegation to inquire whether the reported news is true. The rapid development of the situation in the three northeastern provinces has made the situation more and more complicated. The Chinese government's anxiety is well known to everyone. The government's opinions on this development have also been telegraphed to the Chinese delegation from time to time. If there is such a document with this intention sent to the League of Nations, it must be that the words and sentences were erroneous during the delay in the transmission of the telegram. The procedure of the investigation team was completely determined after consultation with the Chinese representative, and China has no reason to be dissatisfied, etc.</p>
<p>Havas Agency</p>
<h3 id="e19">Correction for Song's Telegram <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Havas Agency Shanghai, 24th message, yesterday this agency received a message from Geneva regarding the telegram sent by Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance and Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, to Yan Huiqing, the chief Chinese representative in Geneva. All the newspapers in Shanghai printed it this morning. Recently, this agency has learned that after this news was released, the Chinese people found it strange. This agency believes that the message from Geneva that was received yesterday should be supplemented with the following explanation to clarify the truth. Earlier a few days ago, British Minister to China Lampson telegraphed London to ask first the British government and then the Secretariat of the League of Nations whether they agreed to the current Manchurian investigation team in Shanghai to participate in the negotiations to resolve the Shanghai Incident. Therefore, London, Geneva, and other political centers naturally had different opinions. It was within the intention of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations to telegraph the Nanjing government for their opinion on this matter. Song Ziwen can represent the opinion of the Chinese government, which is beyond doubt. Because the Chinese delegation asked for instructions, he sent a telegram to Yan Huiqing, saying that the itinerary and procedure of the Manchurian investigation team were stipulated by the resolution of the Executive Council of the League of Nations on December 10, 1931. The Chinese government does not want it to be changed. Song's telegram was sent to the League of Nations by Yan Huiqing in a letter, and Secretary-General Drummond replied to this letter, saying that the Chinese government's opinion could be stated directly to the Manchurian investigation team, especially by the Chinese assistant Gu Weijun to convey it, and that the task of the investigation team, after the resolution of the League of Nations Executive Council on December 10 of the previous year, has not changed in any way.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Comforting Western Troops <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The European and American troops stationed in Shanghai were first comforted separately by representatives elected by Japanese overseas businessmen. The Shanghai Citizens Local Maintenance Association believed that as the people of our country, it should pay special attention to the matter. Therefore, the Maintenance Association entrusted Mr. Kong Yongzhi and his family to first express their comfort to the French army, specially giving each French officer a table blanket, and 1,500 soldiers each a porcelain cup. Starting from the 16th, Hu Yunqiu, a member of the Maintenance Association, and the wives of various members, successively expressed their comfort to the British, American, and Italian troops. There were 3,830 British troops, 150 officers, 1,030 infantrymen of the 31st American Regiment, 63 officers, 1,480 marines of the 4th Regiment, 75 officers, and 424 Italian marines, 33 officers. Each soldier was given a pair of silk stockings, and each officer was given a pair of brocade cushions. A silver bottle was given to the British Defense Commander, the American Marine Corps Commander, and the Shanghai International Merchant Corps Commander, and a pair of embroidered cushions were given to the other commanders. Until yesterday, they were sent and addressed one after another. The commanders of the respective troops said that it was natural for them to come to Shanghai to jointly defend the city out of friendship, and they respectfully received and thanked the various gifts.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Overseas Chinese Oppose Humiliating Peace Telegram <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>To respected representatives Guo Taiqi and Jiang Guangding, Shanghai Shenbao forwards: The Japanese bandits are removing our barriers and invading our heartland, treating us like Korea. There is no room for negotiation. Peace can only be restored when they voluntarily withdraw from Shanghai and Manchuria, and compensate us for our losses. Moreover, our 19th Route Army bravely slays the enemy, their military achievements are renowned, and admired by all nations. Rather than endure humiliation and seek peace, we would rather fight to the last man. You bear the heavy responsibility of negotiating peace. The life and death of our country depend on you.

<h3 id="e22">Recent News on Japanese Military Transportation <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>11th Division Continues Withdrawal: The Japanese 11th Division is continuing its withdrawal to Japan. The first batch departed Shanghai on the 21st of this month. The second batch, consisting of the division headquarters camp and officers and soldiers, departed from the Huangpu Wharf around 11 AM yesterday, boarding the transport ship Tsukuba Maru. Furthermore, four battalions of infantry and a portion of cavalry from the Rikutojima Brigade and the Zentsuji Brigade also boarded the transport ships Maya Maru and Kasuga Maru at the Zhanghuabang Wharf in Wusong at noon yesterday, and sailed back to Japan. In addition, one regiment of artillery and one battalion each of engineers and transport troops are scheduled to board ships today. Thus, the entire 11th Division has been withdrawn. Their baggage, military equipment, and various types of ammunition were loaded onto other transport ships such as the Taishan Maru and left Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese Police and Gendarmes Arrive Again: It seems Japan intends to occupy the conquered territories for a long time. Previously, a team of gendarmes and a contingent of police were transferred. Now, due to the need for gendarmes in the rear, another team of gendarmes and over a hundred police officers have been dispatched to Shanghai. These police and gendarmes have been assigned to reside and serve in areas such as Zhabei and Hongkou.</p>
<p>Arms and Food Shipped from Outside the Pass: Multiple shipments of Japanese military equipment have been brought from outside the pass to Shanghai to supply the Japanese troops stationed there. Furthermore, a batch of military supplies allocated by Honjo Shigeru has arrived from Dalian, along with a large quantity of lumber needed at the front and a large amount of military rations. They were all loaded onto a certain Osaka-bound Japanese ship and arrived at 8:30 AM yesterday, and were immediately unloaded and transported ashore at Yangshupu.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Economic Power</p>
<h3 id="e23">Japanese Attempt at Monopoly <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Says the Shanghai Battle Was Significant</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Minister Abo Admiral came to Shanghai to inspect the post-war situation, then returned to Japan after completing his duties. He expressed his opinion that China's wealth originates in the Yangtze River basin. To develop trade with China, it is necessary to secure a superior position in Yangtze River transportation, and then economic strategies can be developed. Although Japan has secured a position in the Yangtze River, it is still inferior to other countries (seemingly referring to Britain). This battle in Shanghai is of great significance. In the future, China's commercial economy and everything else in the Yangtze River basin will use this military power to achieve a position of monopoly and superiority.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Bomb at Soong Tzu-wen's Home <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>This is the Second Time</p>
<p>A Girl Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3:15 PM, another bomb exploded in the backyard near the southern end of the short wall of the former residence of Soong Tzu-wen, Minister of Finance of the National Government and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, at No. 83 Avenue Petain in the French Concession. At the time, Xu Li Linxian (age 14, from Wusong), the adopted daughter of the servant guarding the residence, was playing in the garden and was hit by shrapnel in the jaw and right arm, immediately falling unconscious. Several guards and servants of the Soong residence suddenly heard a loud noise and, knowing something was wrong, rushed into the garden to investigate. They saw Linxian lying on the ground, unconscious, with shrapnel scattered all over the ground and the smell of sulfur still lingering. The Soong servants immediately reported the incident to the French Concession Police Station at Louza, and also urgently notified Minister Soong's current residence on Qizhi Road. Upon receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to conduct a thorough investigation. They first transported the injured Xu Li Linxian to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment, where she soon regained consciousness. According to the doctor's diagnosis, the injuries were minor and her life was not in danger. The detectives then thoroughly inspected the area around the garden but found no traces. They collected all the shrapnel for safekeeping and reported back to the chief for further investigation. The French Concession authorities have paid close attention to the repeated unfortunate incidents at the Soong residence. The first incident occurred on January 4th of this year, when Zhou Ada, the son of a gatekeeper, was injured. Now, less than three months later, a second similar incident has occurred, indicating that something significant is going on. Police Commissioner Fevrier has issued an order to his subordinates for a thorough investigation and to solve the case as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Relief Society Treats Refugees: The Shanghai War Zone Temporary Relief Society for Refugees has been continuing its relief efforts with great intensity in recent days. It is reported that most of the rescued refugees are farmers from the Nanxiang and Jiading areas. Considering that many refugees in the various lodging places are suffering from smallpox and measles, the society urgently needs to send them to various isolation hospitals for diagnosis and treatment to prevent infection. At the same time, it has sent a letter to the Municipal Health Bureau requesting that they provide free transportation for distribution to facilitate relief. The society has increased the number of lodging places to twenty-nine. In order to ensure the safety of the refugees, it recently sent a letter to the Concession authorities requesting that they instruct the various police stations to provide special protection.</p>
<p>Jisheng Society Provides Relief in Suzhou: The Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Society has established a temporary relief office of the White Cross inside the Baolin Temple Hidden Poor Society in Suzhou City because there are many refugees in Taicang, Qingpu, and Suzhou areas. It has elected officials and started operations on March 18th, and has also set up refugee shelters in various places and sent teams to rescue women and child refugees and send them to Suzhou for accommodation. It does not solicit donations from outside, but benevolent people with great virtue who are willing to help with relief can deliver donations to the society in Shanghai for forwarding, or deliver them to the office inside the Baolin Temple Hidden Poor Society in Suzhou City. Receipts will be issued and published in the newspapers to express gratitude.</p>

Now, Mr. Jiang Guiqing has transferred 200 yuan from the banquet expenses of the Yiyuan Tiehao moving to a new location to help, showing enthusiastic support. However, the relief funds are far from sufficient, and it is still hoped that benevolent fellow townsmen will generously donate.</p>

<p>The True Meaning of Urgent Grain Relief in Pudong: After the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, factories along the Pudong River were greatly affected, leading to a sharp increase in unemployed workers. Mr. Liu Hongsheng and others, to plan ahead, discussed with Mr. Du Yuesheng to find ways to help the unemployed workers and poor residents along the Pudong River. Mr. Du immediately consulted with the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association and the local police district to investigate the people in need of assistance, and printed a form for investigation. As of March 14, there were 24,500 people. Starting from the 16th, rice was distributed according to the listed number of people, with 0.3 sheng of rice for adults and half for children, every five days. Each time, a total of 300 shi of rice was needed. The first distribution has already been completed. Mr. Liu helped with one-sixth of the rice, totaling 300 shi. Various industry leaders have committed to 200+ shi and if there were people willing to continue to donate, the insufficient amount will be taken care of by Mr. Du. Mr. Du does not promote forced donations. Also, this relief effort is purely for the unemployed and the impoverished. People who are employed, or temporarily unemployed but still able to support themselves, do not need to receive this assistance, so that more rice can be made available to truly struggling workers and residents. Recently, some workers have been requesting relief from the Social Bureau. The Social Bureau is struggling to cope, so they invited Mr. Chang Yuqing to form another relief association for unemployed workers. Yesterday, Mr. Chang and officials from the Social Bureau met at the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association to discuss the matter. It was decided that Mr. Chang would invite people from the industry to Pudong today to explain the meaning of the relief effort and conduct a review. Once confirmed, the rice will be distributed. The Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association deeply hopes that the Social Bureau will urgently seek fundamental relief.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association has a total of 74 refugee shelters run by various organizations in Shanghai. However, the methods are scattered and urgently need to be connected. The Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association aims to concentrate on discussing common problems of various shelters to improve the accommodation and post-disaster affairs. It specially convened various groups and their refugee shelters for a general assembly at 2 PM yesterday. Over fifty representatives from the Renji Hall, the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Relief Center, the Red Swastika Society, the Citizens' Association, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, the Jianghuai Association, the Jiangning Guild Hall West Hall, the Coal Industry Guild, the Catholic Believers Association, and the representatives of various groups and shelters, such as the Shien Shelter Representative, were present. Li Dixian of the Red Swastika Society was elected as chairman. Hu Yunqiu and Kui Yanfang first reported the purpose of the meeting and the status of the association, hoping that all sectors would employ more refugees as staff and workers, and also hoped that the various shelters would register separately and workers would register with the association, so that people could find jobs and jobs could find people. Then the articles of association were passed one by one, and Cai Renbao delivered various undertakings, which should be started from each refugee shelter. Finally, it was decided that each shelter should submit a report to the association at any time and that another meeting would be held at the same place on the 30th of this month (Wednesday).</p>

<p>Dedicated to Housing Single, Dispersed Women and Children</p>
<p>To Plan for Education, Reunification, and Post-Disaster Care</p>
<p>The Shanghai War Zone Temporary Relief Society for Refugees, in view of the fact that there are many people who have been separated from their families during the war, has paid special attention to the refugees it has taken in. If there are people who are separated from their families and urgently need to be recognized, they will be photographed and displayed at the entrance of the society, so that they can be reunited. Xu Jingren, Huang Bo Du, Huang Hanzhi, and other permanent committee members of the society still considered this method to be insufficient. Therefore, the permanent member Huang Bo Du proposed a method to protect single women and children at the last standing committee meeting, which has already been resolved. On the one hand, the directors of each lodging home will properly protect them and explain at any time. On the other hand, letters have been sent to the Public Security Bureau, the police stations of the two concessions, and the port detectives of the Chinese Women and Children Relief Society to intensify the investigation of the abduction and sale of refugee women and request the assistance of the Bar Association in dealing with such cases. In addition, letters have been sent to various courts, requesting that criminals who abduct and flee with refugees be severely punished in order to warn evil people. As for the management and care of single women and children, it has been decided to use the Western-style house at No. 751 Albert Road as the society's lodging home for women and children. All single women and children in the society's various lodging homes will be concentrated there from tomorrow. The organization of the lodging home and the procedures for recruitment and recognition, education, and post-disaster affairs will be handled exclusively by Feng Liutang, the deputy director of the society's executive group, who will be publicly recommended by the society. As for management, Huang Ejun, Ms. Liu Lingji, and Ms. Wang [blank space] Yu will be in charge of everything.</p>

<p>Totaling Over 500,000 Yuan in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong Districts Previously, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to investigate the statistics of fire brigade losses during the war in the war zone, separately ordered each team to report the value of the losses for statistics. It is now learned that the three districts of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong have been investigated and reported. The fire brigades of Hujiamuqiao, Hongzhen, and Zhenru, because the site is still occupied by the Japanese army, have not been able to investigate and have not reported. The statistics of losses in the three districts that have been investigated are recorded below: site and buildings 41,400 yuan, office supplies 23,626 yuan, fire alarm bells 74,200 yuan, pump trucks 134,920 yuan, hose reels 19,720 yuan, ladder truck heads 17,800 yuan, chemical extinguishers 4,200 yuan, discharge hoses 98,280 yuan, firefighting equipment 28,234 yuan, seasonal uniforms 57,750 yuan, firemen's raincoats 4,400 yuan, totaling 504,530 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Railway Ministry Orders Attention to Traitors <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Using Military Telephones to Transmit Military Information</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Police Departments yesterday received an instruction from the Railway Ministry, stating that, in compliance with an official matter, a letter from the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters dated March 6th stated that Mr. He Zhuolian, the chief of the Pukou Office in this city, reported that according to the people of Pukou, the Japanese side has dispatched ninety traitors to spy on the situation in Xiaguan, Pukou, and other places. It is said that although there is no concrete evidence, it is not without reason that these people can easily investigate our military situation, but it is very difficult for us to capture them. However, the way they transmit information is either by going to Japanese warships or by using telephones and telegraphs. Therefore, our attention should be focused on starting from here to block their transmission. Moreover, now is a time of external emergency. If military telephones are not thoroughly rectified, it will be difficult to handle matters smoothly and easily leak information. It is often seen that troops in the capital freely set up telephones, with poles and eaves everywhere, military telephones are more chaotic than spider webs, how can it be said to be careful? In my humble opinion, all military telephones in the capital should be reorganized by the Transportation Department to ensure order and easy inspection, and unless it is a very important military matter, the use of telephone calls should not be allowed in order to ensure security. Therefore, it is requested that the Capital Police Department be ordered to instruct the police stations and guards in the city, suburbs, Xiaguan, and Pukou to pay attention to and immediately investigate and deal with those who are not wearing official symbols and are communication soldiers who are setting up telephone machines or eavesdropping on military information on telephone lines. In addition, a request should be made to the Ministry of Military Affairs to promulgate regulations on the use of military telephones, ordering the telephone team, the 1st Regiment of Transportation Corps, and the communication units of various divisions stationed in Beijing to strictly abide by and strictly inspect to prevent leakage of military information. Correspondingly, a letter is requested to your bureau to instruct the railway police along the route to pay close attention and strictly interrogate. Anyone encountering the above situation should be immediately arrested and sent to the Ministry for investigation to emphasize the importance of military information.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Ministry of Finance Reduces and Exempts Business Tax on Raw Silk and Secondhand Clothing <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Business Tax Collection Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau previously received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating that raw silk is a unique product of our country, which has suffered huge losses due to the competition from Japanese silk. It was requested that the Ministry's regulations on business tax reduction and exemption be followed and submitted to the Ministry for approval of tax exemption. The office submitted a report to the Finance Bureau, requesting the Municipal Government to transfer it to the Ministry of Finance for approval of tax exemption. It is now known that the office has forwarded the Ministry of Finance's Decree No. 324, approving the exemption of business tax on raw silk. It is also known that the Ministry of Finance has also approved the business tax on the secondhand clothing industry, which will be levied at 2/1000 of the business volume.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Maintaining Silk and Tea Finance <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Banking and Qianzhuang Guilds, stating: We are writing to inform you that on the 24th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products, stating that according to the joint proposal of Executive Committee members Zhang Deqi, Lin Guyun, Xi Guansheng, Shen Shuyu, etc., our country is famous for silk and tea, especially the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, with Shanghai as the main distribution center. Since the invasion of Shanghai by the Japanese, all industries have been suspended, and the banking and qianzhuang industries have also been shut down as a result. All industries deeply feel the stagnation of finance and lack vitality. However, the production of silk and tea is about to be launched on the market, especially the tea season is approaching. Once it is overdue, it will be wasted. The livelihood of farmers in the three provinces will be declared bankrupt. At this critical moment of resisting aggression, this is not conducive to the welfare of the rear area. This matter concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood, and there should be safe preparations. It is proposed that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce send a letter to the Banking and Qianzhuang Guilds, informing all members to continue to provide circulation to silk and tea merchants with good credit before the silk and tea season, so that they can explore new products, regulate the market, maintain national products, and stabilize people's livelihood, etc. This proposal has been submitted to the 12th 11th Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees, and it was resolved and recorded. Correspondingly, we are sending the recorded proposal for your consideration. We hope that your association will investigate and promptly send a letter to the Banking and Qianzhuang Guilds to provide financial convenience to silk and tea merchants with good credit, relieve people's livelihood, and we look forward to your reply. As approved by the association, it has been found that since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, all industries have been suspended, and the inability of finance to circulate as usual has made it impossible for various industries to operate. Now that the silk and tea industries are about to be launched on the market, especially the tea season is approaching, the association advocates that financial turnover should still be provided to silk and tea merchants with good credit, which is indeed an essential method to regulate the market. Correspondingly, we are writing to your association to investigate and adopt this proposal, and we look forward to your reply.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Summary of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Budget for This Year <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council approved the draft budget for 1932 and the attached comments of the Finance Committee on March 18th at its meeting this Wednesday. The Finance Department stated when submitting this draft that it was submitted to the committee's hands before the election of directors, according to Judge Feetham's proposal.</p>
<p>In September of last year, the department head had predicted that there would be a huge deficit. Fortunately, the exchange rate improved and various departments promoted austerity, so a surplus of Taels 351,000 was still achieved. Also, because the debt owed by the Bureau had been resolved, some current expenditures could be reclassified as capital expenditures.</p>
<p>The current expenditure for 1932 totals Taels 15,500,000, but the education expenditure is calculated separately. The amounts for each department are generally less than last year, but this will not affect public affairs. For example, the Public Works Department will reduce Taels 260,870 compared to last year by classifying certain current expenses as temporary expenses. This method has been deemed reasonable by the auditor. The separate budget for education is also the reason for the reduction in the Public Works Department's expenses. Regarding the Bureau's orchestra, efforts have been made to reduce expenses, and further reductions may be necessary in the future. However, the concerts held in the future should adopt a more ordinary program so that increased fees can offset the cost of equipment. The Bureau's policy is to replace foreign-hired members with locally hired members, and those hired overseas should also be encouraged</p>
<p>The Finance Department's budget is roughly the same as last year. Two senior positions are vacant and have not yet been considered for replacement. If so, two Chinese staff members may need to be promoted this year, and a corresponding assistant should be added. As for the Revenue Department</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>section, it is now included in the Finance Department's budget. The number is slightly increased because of the promotion of senior officials. Mr. Allan's remuneration has been listed in the ordinary expenses.</p>
<p>The General Office's expenses are approximately Taels 325,000, slightly less than last year. The Legal Department's expenses are Taels 89,000, 2/10 more than last year, due to natural growth and the approved improvement measures for the assistant lawyer's office. The Chinese Department plans to add an assistant, which is subject to the Board of Directors' approval. The Information Department's budget is approximately Taels 45,000, which is the first time it has appeared in the budget. Also, the general expenses item is much less than last year because there are not many special expenses, such as the Feetham Report, the Hill Report, and the Salary Committee of last year.</p>
<p>In response to the Chairman's inquiry, the department head also stated that the subsidy for the Anti-Kidnapping Association is Taels 20,000, and the association will probably apply for it soon. All organizations subsidized by the Bureau should submit the previous year's expenses to the Bureau before preparing the budget to apply for this year's subsidy, otherwise it will be very inconvenient.</p>
<p>Regarding interest, commission, and other items, the interest on the unpaid funds of the electricity company was a huge amount. The company has paid the funds on time according to the agreement, which the Bureau has used for investment projects. This amount has now been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>The income items in the budget were prepared before the incident in this port. It is impossible to predict how much the total donation and public utilities will be short this year, so only the original amount can be retained and other measures can be taken to make up for it. The land tax item is less than that listed in 1931 to reserve space for tax-free land properties. The municipal donation and special donation are listed in a larger number due to the natural development of the city and the inclusion of the amount of tax reduction and exemption. The amount of reduction and exemption has been listed separately under the expenditure item.</p>
<p>The dock donation is estimated to be Taels 150,000 less than last year due to a slight change in the distribution ratio with neighboring areas. In addition, more and more goods have recently been unloaded from Pudong, so the Bureau has suffered a lot of losses.</p>
<p>Under the items of public utilities and Bureau-operated businesses, the continuous purchase of water company stocks has been listed under the "Interest" category and classified as investment, as it is no different from other investments. In addition, the amount of Taels 287,440 has been classified as special income and expenditure.</p>
<p>As for the current martial law situation, it is impossible to know exactly how much money will be needed. However, Taels 400,000 has been deducted from the ordinary income item and Taels 800,000 has been added to the special expenditure item. This has already included the reduced tax revenue, but this expense should be amortized over several years.</p>
<p>The addition of Taels 1,225,000 to the ordinary income item is because it is still impossible to balance the budget with the current donation amount after exerting extreme austerity. In the past few years, the Bureau has begun to purchase some land that exceeds the needs of various departments. This method is not intended to be changed due to the suitability of investment. The amount listed now is the expected surplus from the sale of land. This number is approximately equal to 2-3% of the municipal donation for nine months. Adding this number to the current income of Taels 14,312,000 results in a surplus of approximately Taels 11,000.</p>
<p>The expenditure of the special budget is approximately Taels 18,916,000, and the items listed therein have been reviewed by various departments and revised in consultation with the Director of Public Works. The deficit carried over from last year is Taels 516,300, which exceeds the estimate by more than Taels 160,000 due to the intensified road repair work.</p>
<p>Regarding special income, the electricity company should pay Taels 16,000,000 this year, of which Taels 8,000,000 will be used to repay the 1922 public debt, and the rest will be used for investment and fund purposes. Also included in this list is an income of Taels 2,000,000, which should be raised by issuing bonds or other means if necessary. If it is not necessary, bond issuance should still be avoided, or the Board of Directors of bondholders can be contacted for Taels 2,000,000, or this amount can be overdrafted from the bank for a few months to await the next payment from the electricity company. In total, the special income is approximately Taels 19,000,000, leaving a surplus of approximately Taels 84,000.</p>
<p>The education budget lists an income of Taels 1,384,090, which is approximately 1.74% of the total municipal donation and land tax. The school subsidy item is listed in this budget for the first time.</p>
<p>One director claimed that the foreign school subsidy had not been issued last year and was waiting to be issued together with the Chinese school subsidy. The latter was suspended because no agreement had been reached with the Chinese authorities, and the former should not be affected by this. This motion was passed and the Finance Department Director was instructed to handle it accordingly.</p>
<p>Another director stated that several schools in the budget have received special subsidies and have been exempted from donations. If they receive additional subsidies now, the benefits of each school will be confused. The Finance Department Director replied that it would be difficult to distinguish the various subsidies if they were not unified. This matter will be reported separately, or the budget for the next year may be able to be clarified.</p>
<p>Regarding the education item under special expenditure, Taels 539,430 has been transferred from the general budget. This method allows citizens who advocate increasing or decreasing education expenses to know how much the annual education expense is, and it can also help the Board of Directors decide whether to continue to supply this policy.</p>
<p>The department head also stated that the municipal donation will not be increased this year because the martial law situation makes it difficult for taxpayers to bear it. However, he believes that the amount of donation borne by land properties is not fair. In order to increase income for Bureau use, he still advocates re-evaluating land prices according to the previous method.</p>

<p>Lasted for Three Hours</p>
<p>The case of lawyer Wu Mai suing Wu Zequan, the section chief of the Public Security Bureau, and others for injury was resumed by the District Court yesterday afternoon. Prosecutor Shen opened a preliminary investigation court and secretly interrogated Wu Mai. The three reasons for his accusations against Wu Zequan, Ding [blank], Wen Yingxing, etc. for injury, obstructing freedom, and murder lasted for three hours. The testimony was very strict, and the court door was tightly closed, making it impossible to find out. As a result, Wu Mai was still ordered to return to the hospital for treatment and await review. It is rumored that the Shanghai Lawyers Association believes that the defendants are all administrative officials of this city, and the trial is very inconvenient. It plans to request that the case be transferred to another jurisdiction for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Statement from the Producer of the Shanghai War Film <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the audience at the Nanjing National Grand Theater was outraged by the Shanghai War film produced by Tianyi Film Company, which depicted the Japanese army's aircraft and heavy artillery bombing our army, which was close to promoting the Japanese military's power, resulting in a conflict. It is now known that the producer of this film was not Tianyi Film Company, but American film technician Xu Guojun, who filmed the battlefield situation. Although Xu Guo is employed by Tianyi Film Company as one of the employees of the sound film department, this film was actually produced by Xu Guo on his own initiative, and all responsibilities and authority belong to Xu Guo. Therefore, Tianyi Film Company has repeatedly stated in correspondence with Director Fan of the 19th Route Army Rear Office and the Nanjing Film Inspection Committee regarding the screening of this film in Beijing that the film was made by Xu Guo personally, and the copyright belongs to Xu Guo. It shows that Tianyi Film Company is not responsible for the content of the production and screening procedures. It is also heard that Xu Guo said that the film was produced at a time when the Chinese military was winning the war. The film completely captured the valiant fighting situation of the 19th Route Army. The bombing by Japanese aircraft and artillery can prove the [blank] power of the Japanese military. He is an American and has been in China for many years. He will never promote the Japanese military's power for no reason, as the relationship between China and the United States is traditionally friendly.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of Dull Trading Before the Holiday</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was particularly peaceful, but the price rebounded and weakened, returning to within the Taels 690 level. From morning to noon, there were only two or three Taels of trading volume. There was not much buying and selling in the market. The silver market and foreign exchange had risen, and people's hearts tended to weaken. The opening was low, and there was some progress and retreat afterwards. In the end, the trading volume was more than Taels 6, and the market was closed in the afternoon. The May contract opened in the morning and fell sharply by Taels 9.2 to Taels 683.5. The price of large silver suddenly rebounded by 7/16, the forward rate by 3/8, and the US dollar also rose by 3/8. The British gold price was listed at 125. The US dollar was 25. Only Qian Changxiang and others entered the market to buy, adding Taels 2 to Taels 85.5. It was suddenly sold by Hengyu Shunli, losing Taels 2 to Taels 83.5. Later, Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Heng, Fu Chang, Hengyu, Da Decheng, and others competed to buy, and banks did a deal for May US dollars at 32.375. Datong and Great Britain did a deal for March at 375. Dehua and Mai exchanged forward British gold at 9 pence 125, causing the price to rise. There was a difference of two Taels up and down in half an hour, reaching Taels 87.5 at 9:50. In an instant, Da Xingyong and others came to sell. Chinese banks did a deal for May British gold at 9 pence 125, also absorbing 1875, so the price could not be sustained and fell by four Taels in just a moment, to Taels 83.5 at 10:00. Yifeng Yong and others bought in again, picking up more than three Taels, reaching Taels 86.8 at 10:30. Afterwards, the April British gold could be traded at 3125, and the forward US dollar was absorbed by Huabi at Taels 32.5, and Zhifeng Yong and retail long positions took the opportunity to sell, so the price immediately fell by two or three Taels, to Taels 84 at 11:00. Arbitrageurs and short positions, etc., seeing that the price was small, sold out and entered. There was a turnover of more than one Taels, reaching Taels 86.5 at 11:45. However, the floor trading was sluggish, and the price was mediocre. By the time the market closed at noon, it was Taels 86, a decrease of Taels 6.7 compared to the previous noon.

Even the three principles of withdrawing troops should be considered unacceptable, because military failure, with one's back to the wall, can still be remedied, but diplomatic failure means the loss of rights and humiliation of the nation, which is difficult to recover throughout history. The rise and fall of the nation are at stake, and we sincerely hope that the central government will adhere to the spirit of 'better to be a shattered jade than an unbroken tile,' persist in the advocacy of long-term resistance against Japan, and if war is waged, quickly dispatch elite troops to join in the fight, and if peace is negotiated, it should be based on the principle of not losing rights and humiliating the nation.

<p>Students Investigate and Prohibit the Sale of Inferior Goods, Leading to a Market Strike</p>
<p>Both Sides Confront Each Other with Weapons, Causing Chaos Throughout the City</p>
<p>The Authorities Impose Temporary Martial Law and Send Personnel to Mediate</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to customs reports, inferior goods accounted for nine-tenths of imports this month. Merchants only know how to seek profit and disregard warnings and accusations from all sides, truly lacking conscience. Students from Tangshan Jiaotong University, Fengluo Middle School, and other schools organized the National Salvation United Association and repeatedly planned to investigate and prohibit inferior goods, but were prevented from doing so by the Party and government. Later, through the mediation of Lu Tan, a representative of the Public Security Bureau, Zhou Qinxi of the Bank of Communications, and Ze Kun, the director of moral education at Jiaotong University, merchants were persuaded to register their inferior goods with the National Salvation United Association, sell them off, and no longer sell them. The merchants ignored this, and the Public Security Bureau even issued a notice stating that, according to a letter from the Party headquarters in the urban area, the National Salvation United Association was illegally organized and should cease its activities. The students were outraged. At 10:00 a.m. on the 23rd, they gathered more than 300 people, each carrying hammers, wooden boards, nails, and seals, and went to the Party headquarters to petition for the sealing of inferior goods. Yang Letian, a member of the Party headquarters, expressed deep sympathy to the students and immediately led them to set off. Upon hearing the news, the merchants went on strike. The students immediately closed the Ruicheng Sheng, Sanyi Cheng, Kuifa Hao, and Kuifa Zhan stores. Then they broke into Liangyi Cheng Zhan, transported away three large carts of inferior goods. At 3:00 p.m., merchants gathered two to three thousand people, each carrying sticks, intending to fight the students. The city was in chaos, and the police were unable to stop it. Then, Battalion Commander Niu Yuanfeng of the Transport Battalion led his troops to the scene, dispersed the students. The merchants formed a group and went to the Public Security Bureau to petition for: 1) the arrest of Yang Letian; 2) the National Salvation United Association to compensate the merchants for their losses; 3) the Public Security Bureau to be responsible for protecting the merchants. Director Ning Wu accepted their demands and arrested Yang at 6:00 p.m. The National Salvation United Association also held a meeting, and representatives from various civil groups attended, deciding to fight the treacherous merchants and set out on the morning of the 24th. The local garrison, fearing a bloody tragedy, imposed temporary martial law. The students were unable to enter the market, while the merchants continued their strike. The provincial government and the provincial Party headquarters sent personnel to mediate on the afternoon of the 24th. (24th Dispatch) (Tianjin) The 4th Branch Bureau of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau forcibly opened the market on the morning of the 24th. A Liu, a manager from Dechangyuan, was injured by the police. Through the mediation of gentry and directors, the decision to open the market was left to the merchants' discretion. Director Zhang of the Hebei Provincial Public Security Administration Bureau arrived on the afternoon of the 24th and immediately convened a meeting of representatives from the gentry, merchants, military, government, police, and academic circles at the Public Security Bureau. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 p.m., deciding to order the school authorities to be responsible for persuading the students to temporarily suspend the boycott movement and to order the chamber of commerce to encourage the opening of the market. All disputes would be resolved after personnel from the provincial government and the provincial Party headquarters arrived in Tangshan to mediate. However, as of 8:00 p.m., the merchants had not agreed to open the market. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Our country has made a serious protest to the Japanese government regarding the puppet state in the three northeastern provinces, which was entirely orchestrated by Japan, and has made a formal statement to the international community that the Japanese government should be held responsible for this matter and that China will absolutely not recognize it. However, the Japanese side's reply has evaded responsibility, claiming that it was the result of self-determination and has nothing to do with Japan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already refuted this severely. Now, it is learned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed our embassy in Japan, ordering it to strictly refute the Japanese Foreign Ministry's reply. The refutation stated that since the Japanese army illegally occupied various parts of the Northeast, overturned Chinese administrative organs, and lured and coerced a small number of unscrupulous elements to form illegal organizations, although the leaders of these organizations are Chinese, the real power is entirely controlled by Japanese advisors, who are numerous and all dispatched by the Japanese side. Last month, Puyi was even kidnapped to the eastern provinces and forced to take a puppet position in the puppet government, which clearly shows that the Japanese government is not only supporting this illegal organization but is actually the initiator.

<p>There are Important Figures in the Political World Active</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo, 24th - The House of Peers today questioned the affairs of the Three Eastern Provinces, Shanghai, and the assassination of Inoue Takuma. The government was quite embarrassed. The questioner also said that there are several other important figures also being targeted by the assassination corps. Legislator Matsumura gave a speech impeaching the government, scolding the authorities for being unable to move a certain figure behind the scenes, and mentioned the theory that a certain important person in the nation was active behind the League of Blood. Questioning the Minister of the Army, Araki, Araki asked him to explain clearly. Matsumura replied that the person he was referring to had already died as a hero, so out of respect for his widow, he did not want to say his name. Araki neither confirmed nor denied this theory. He then said that according to the spirit of Bushido, cruel assassinations are not allowed, but he believed that junior officers may be motivated by patriotism, leading them to be instigated by external forces. Araki expressed regret over this trend, saying that he would take strict precautions.</p>

<p>Repealing the Oath and Stopping Land Annuity Payments</p>
<p>Reply States It Is Not Permitted by the Agreement</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Reuters) - Overseas Territories Minister Thomas stated in the House of Commons today that Irish representatives informed him that the Irish government believes the oath issue is not specifically stipulated in the treaty, and the Irish government has absolute authority to amend the constitution according to public opinion. Thomas continued, stating that the oath issue is an inseparable part of the treaty signed ten years ago and has been strictly adhered to by both parties to this day. Therefore, the British government will clearly state this viewpoint in its note to Ireland. Regarding land annuities, Thomas said that the British government has not yet received any formal documents, but according to the statements of Southern Irish leader de Valera, the Free State government intends to withhold land annuity payments. However, he stated that the British government had lent money to Irish tenants to buy land, and the aforementioned annuities are to repay this debt. Thomas continued, stating that it is evident that Ireland should continue to pay the Debt Commissioners. Stopping payments would be a blatant breach of the agreement, as the agreement binds Ireland and the signatory country. After the parliamentary recess, Thomas reiterated that this serious issue should be dealt with calmly and patiently, and stated that the time for debate has not yet arrived.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Issue of Convening an International Silver Conference <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>U.S. Monetary Commission Seeks Opinions from Various Countries</p>
<p>Washington, 23rd (Reuters) - On February 8th, the House of Representatives instructed an investigation into the causes of the low silver prices. Subsequently, under the guidance of Mr. Somers, a Monetary Commission was formed to investigate the causes and effects of the low silver prices, the monetary policies of various countries, and their relationship with banks. It also studies the possibility of convening an international conference to consider international cooperation to stabilize silver prices. The Monetary Commission has now requested economists, bankers, and government officials from eight countries to express their views on the feasibility of convening an international conference. This letter has been sent to former British Cabinet member Horne, London Bank President Norman, and HSBC General Manager Eldis, as well as China's Bei Songsun, and bankers from France, Mexico, Canada, India, and Sweden, requesting their opinions. American bankers such as Young and Gilbane are also among those invited. The letter is accompanied by the Monetary Commission's declaration of February 25th, which states that the silver issue is an international problem that can only be resolved through international cooperation. However, whether cooperation can be found at present is a problem that must be resolved. There should be a relationship between gold and silver, but this does not mean that gold and silver must be subject to a common production ratio, nor does it mean that a bimetallic system is desired. From various appearances, there is no way to restore world prices other than to make the purchasing medium of the East sound, as the people of the East account for one-fifth of the global total. If international trade does not return to normal, no country can continue to develop its natural resources and produce its goods. Therefore, the urgency of immediate action in this regard is obvious to all.

<p>Rio de Janeiro, 24th (Reuters) - Brazil has been under a dictatorship for over a year. Recently, the provinces of São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul demanded the restoration of freedom of speech. Interim President Vargas has therefore convened a meeting of political figures and decided to restore the constitutional system. Committees have been appointed to draft a new constitution, clear national and provincial debts, and prepare for parliamentary elections this year. Before the general election, Vargas will continue to serve as interim president. It is expected that the election will be held soon.</p>

<p>Sending Banners and Items to Welcome Him</p>
<p>He Jian Also Rewards Him with 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence - Zhang Fakui's troops are heading north to resist the Japanese, passing through Hunan along a route designated by He Jian. Therefore, the army's progress is very rapid. Deputy Commander Wu also sent a telegram regarding the army's passage through Hunan, stating the following points: 1) During this passage through Hunan, the troops will be restrained and will pass through quickly. Except for a small number of new recruits without weapons, all local Hunanese militia forces will be refused, and even a small number of former subordinates who had dispersed to various places in previous years will be stopped from rejoining. Every effort will be made to ensure the peace and tranquility of Hunan Province and prevent any impact from the army. 2) The army will send representatives to visit the local authorities in advance of arriving in each city, requesting them to inform their subordinates not to be suspicious. There are many people in Hunan Province who welcome the army and present many gifts of慰問品, such as rush-making silk banners embroidered with words such as "Loyal Servants of the Party and State" and "Iron-Blooded Nation Salvation." They also purchased towels, biscuits, and other items, and representatives from various groups were sent to deliver them to the army. The Provincial Party Headquarters also sent Executive Committee member Huang Xigong, the General Headquarters and the Provincial Government sent the Provincial Capital Garrison Commander Hu Da, and the Hunan People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association sent members Yao Xuehuai and Zhou Naigu, carrying goods to Lilu to慰勞 the army. He Jian also sent a reward of 10,000 yuan to慰勞 the officers and soldiers, and a letter expressing his respect. It can be seen from this that the people of Hunan Province are filled with enthusiastic sympathy for the army (22nd).</p>
<p>Japan Arrests Anti-Imperialist League Members</p>
<p>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reports that at 2:00 PM on the 17th, the Hongō Fuji Police Station, after detecting that several Imperial University students were holding a secret meeting on the second floor of the Mizukami Rice Store at 27 Yushima Hanacho, surrounded the area with dozens of police officers and arrested Tanaka Toshio, a student in the Faculty of Letters; Nagata Yukio, a student in the Faculty of Letters; Terazaki Tamotsu, a student in the Faculty of Law; Fukai Tokio, a student in the Faculty of Science; Ishii Hisao, a student in the Faculty of Economics; and Ishikawa Kiyoo, a student in the Faculty of Letters. These individuals were all the masterminds of groups such as the Anti-Imperialist League and Autonomous Student Associations on the eve of Kigen-setsu (Empire Day). On that day, they were preparing various things and taking action. It is also reported that at 6:00 AM on the 19th, all the detectives of the Kōtō section of the Dadaihatagaya Police Station mobilized and rushed to the residence of Kim Jae-sam in the Ōyamadani area of Shimokitazawa, Setagaya Town, outside Tokyo City, and arrested six members of the Anti-Imperialist League. They also found a bundle of leaflets from the Japanese branch of the Communist Party, as well as maps of the new Manchuria, *Mu Shin*, *Mu Qing*, *Lao Shin*, and many other unstable publications. After a thorough investigation, it was revealed that this place was the general headquarters of the Anti-Imperialist League, and the arrested individuals were the leaders of the Anti-Imperialist League. They had been very active in recent days, preparing to connect with various groups and carry out a gate-fighting movement during the parliamentary session.</p>
<p>Jiji Shinpo reports that at midnight on the 13th, the Ebarahara Police Station outside Tokyo City arrested more than a dozen members of the Japanese Anti-Imperialist League at 159 Kamishakujii, near the Akiyamei Awakubo. Among them were students from Chuo University. On National Foundation Day and Army Memorial Day, they were still distributing leaflets against the invasion of Manchuria and other radical and unstable documents in the labor streets of Tokyo Prefecture, and they were also inciting the Yokohama streetcar strike.</p>
<p>Kobe Yushin Nippo reports that in the Yokohama streetcar dispute, the Communist Party's Zenkyo and the Proletarian Youth League secretly joined forces, planned a cell organization, and carried out the fourth reconstruction movement of the Communist Party. The prefectural government has recently detected that their organization is very large and has spread to Kawasaki, Tsurumi, Yokosuka, Hiratsuka,</p>
<p>Qinno, Odawara and other places, with a strong presence. The party members are all teachers and students from vocational schools, middle schools, and elementary schools. Therefore, on the 12th, the prefectural government secretly ordered the police stations in various places to conduct separate crackdowns. As a result, more than 60 people were arrested, and weapons such as pistols, bullets, Japanese swords, and daggers were seized, almost like a mountain.</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun reports that in the factory areas of Yokohama City, centered on Yokohama Higher Commercial School, Higher Technical School, and various vocational schools, the 赤化 movement (reddening, communization) in various parts of Kanagawa Prefecture is expanding and intensifying day by day. Unstable documents are often found. The Kanagawa Prefecture Special Higher Police Department conducted a large-scale search and arrested 84 extreme leftists, who confessed to planning periodic riots and carrying out a fourth preparatory movement to organize the Communist Party. Among the 84 arrested, many were students from vocational schools and middle schools.</p>

<p>Nagasaki Nichi-nichi Shimbun reports that the Sasebo Police Station held a police examination on the 17th and 18th. There were 121 applicants, and the academic level of the examinees was mostly university and vocational school graduates, followed by middle school graduates, while the number of elementary school graduates taking the examination has decreased sharply. Among the examinees, there were graduates from Takushoku University, Nihon University, Doshisha University, Koyasan University, and many vocational schools. There were three 段 holders in kendo, three 段 holders in judo, and countless elementary school teachers, company employees, and navy soldiers. This shows the difficulty of finding employment in society.</p>
<p>Hochi Shimbun reports that due to the difficulty of finding employment in the country and the increase in unemployment, the South Manchuria Railway recently recruited only 70 employees, while the number of university and vocational school graduates who applied for the examination reached 1,801. Among them, the quota for technical positions was 50, and the number of applicants was more than 500; the quota for administrative positions was 20, and the number of applicants was 1,300. All of them had no choice but to seek other avenues abroad due to the difficulty of finding employment and the hardship of life in the country.</p>
<p>Nagasaki Nichi-nichi Shimbun reports that the appellate court in this city handled 47,730 criminal cases last year, a decrease of 3,304 cases compared to the previous year, but crimes involving intelligence have doubled. What is most noteworthy is the sharp increase in crimes involving embezzlement, fraud, forgery of documents, etc. The future of society cannot help but be disheartened.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Status of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway After Opening <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou News - The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has been operating well since it opened to Lanxi. As this road is an important construction project for transportation in Zhejiang Province, the Railway Bureau is very active in developing the road. For example, given that passenger transport business is booming, although train service has been increased, with two up and down trains each day, passengers are still extremely crowded, so it is imperative to add more vehicles. The 24 passenger car chassis that the Bureau ordered from abroad have recently arrived at the Xixing Works, so the Mechanical Engineering Division has been instructed to expedite the assembly process. It is expected that five third-class passenger cars will be assembled in March, ten third-class passenger cars and second- and third-class mixed cars will be assembled in April, and the remaining nine cars will be fully assembled by May 15 to facilitate travel.</p>
<p>The original plan for the railway was to run directly to Jiangshan to connect with the Yushan County of Jiangxi Province and connect with the Changyu Highway. Later, due to the inadequacy of the provincial treasury, after repeated discussions between former Chairman Zhang Nanxian and former Director of Construction Shi Ying, it was decided to temporarily build the railway to Jinhua and extend the line to Lanxi. Construction above Jinhua was temporarily suspended, and further development will be considered when financial resources are slightly more abundant. However, a highway is still being planned to connect and facilitate transportation. After Chairman Lu and Director of Construction Zeng took office, they believed that the road had a significant relationship with military affairs, culture, and commerce, so they decided to borrow money from banks in Shanghai and Hangzhou to complete it. Therefore, Director Du of the Bureau was instructed to quickly form a survey team to conduct preliminary and repeated surveys of the route above Jinhua, and Director Zeng of the Construction Department contacted banks in Shanghai and Hangzhou to discuss the borrowing of funds. After several negotiations, an understanding and agreement has been reached with the banking community, and the terms of the contract are being discussed. Suddenly, the Shanghai Incident occurred, financial conditions stagnated, and the previous agreement had to be temporarily canceled. It is now known that the survey team has completed the survey last month, and the foundation engineering for the Jinhua River Bridge has also been explored and completed. Drawings are now being made and budgets are being prepared separately. Once the national crisis has subsided slightly and finances are slightly better, construction will continue to complete the original plan and facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>Although the railway has now opened to Lanxi, the ballast has not been laid and the tracks are new, so train travel is still dangerous. Therefore, the engineering personnel of the section have been ordered to complete the ballast laying project within a limited time frame to ensure safety. In addition, many stations do not have platforms, awnings, and sheds. Now, in order to facilitate passengers, it is planned to advance the completion of these facilities. The station masters for each station have been separately appointed.</p>
