<h3>救濟米價之急計寰澄</h3>
<p>穀賤傷農年豐成災於是救濟米價之呼聲逎迫切呌號遍於全社會我國糧食雖無精密確切之統計然就大槪而論似不至遽有生産過度之慮蘇省稱産米區域據蘇建廳報告中稔之歲尙屬不敷民食由是而南浙閩粤桂滇黔諸省均屬缺米之區歲賴洋米接濟北方産麥諸省豫陜魯直不過中稔各省均參種花生棉作不盡種麥而晋陜且以旱歉聞惟長江中游兩湖贛皖等省稻産甚豐産銷相劑如國内調理得宜流通有道何至有糧食慘跌之慮</p>
<p>然而各處米麥價値均告慘跌原因多端而大要不外乎國内不流通又加以國外之壓迫</p>
<p>國内不流通之現象例如粤閩諸省往歲均採辦蕪湖米近歲因皖軍閥濫加米税匪盜阻碍交通蕪米市驟然衰歇天南各省不得不購米於西貢仰光各處今欲恢復國内流通必先捐除米稅保護交通纔有希望</p>
<p>何言乎國外之壓迫全世界麥産統計確屬供過於求而美國存麥尤多據最近報載全球産麥十二萬萬噸而銷數不過七萬萬噸以故美國坎拿大澳洲均向我國競銷賤價銷售猶勝於喂飼牲畜燒燬廢棄於是糧食進口爲壓迫我農産之重要原因</p>
<p>然而政府今猶有美麥借欵之議事之成否不可知而其爲有類乎仰藥引刃則無可疑</p>
<p>有創進口洋米抽税之議者尙躊躇於制定標準價格謂跌過標準始抽税漲過標準則停抽不知我國關税已爭得半自主欲税則税欲停則停儘可隨時酌定何必斷斷於標準一加税則粤閩諸者之購洋米者必轉向内地採購米價不難驟見起色</p>
<p>非特米官加税也即麥子麫粉亦宜加税以制傾銷且税率不宜過輕洋米每石必須在國幣兩元以上麥子每石須一元有半麫粉每包須一元以上迺有保護國内農産之力量</p>
<p>一加税則進口糧食必驟减少加税之目的在於保護農産不在乎增益税收故所收糧食税欵應另行儲存爲恢復農村經濟之用</p>
<p>美麥借欵之議未定則速即取消巳定則借麥應一體加税且應躉儲專供軍食之用不傾銷於市塲以爲補救之計政府如尙顧農民一線之生機保將來無限之税源於此應加意</p>
<p>除内地税以復國内之流通加進口税以制國外之壓迫救濟米價之辦法雖不盡於此而要以此爲最急最要之辦法故先及之</p>

<h3>上院熱烈辯論後英政府對中日案宣示態度</h3>
<p>英在國聯不欲以領袖地位自居願與他國聯合覓取共同的政策工黨領袖開始質問</p>
<p>路透二日倫敦電上院反對黨領袖彭森璧今日詢問英政府對於李頓報告書結論之態度彭氏以莊嚴詞句開始滿洲問題之辯論稱讚李頓調查團之報告書承認調查時所遇之困難環境謂事有可顯然可見者滿洲問題非僅僅恢復原狀所可解决日内瓦考慮此事時英國須在此難題之解决中予以指導此乃甚關重要之點</p>
<p>日軍冒天下大不韙</p>
<p>國聯行動不常如若干人所期望之迅速但巳獲有雖非特殊然亦甚大之勝利以制止遠東戰爭而使當事者雙方集議於一室日本事態變化不巳渠有理由確信世人對於日本軍事情緒之暴發未有熱切贊助之者渠深知各大國可聯合解决滿洲問題云</p>
<p>應進一步抑退一步</p>
<p>自由黨洛襄勳爵稱滿洲爭議中之最大問題爲吾人在其解决中應更進一步以趨向一種國際制度之設立乎抑退後一步以趨向不可避免之戰爭乎美京九國公約凱洛格非戰公約及史汀生宣言如適當堅决運用之皆爲應付此難題極有勢力之工具今日本戰爭氣槪日見昻起即日本之最好友人亦多盧日本可怖的困難或將改變其所以成爲一代頭等國之穏健政策</p>
<p>中國民氣蓬勃方興</p>
<p>同時中國敵愾之氣亦蓬勃方興中國少年或將離憲法之發展而趨向報復之準備苟滿洲之禍根不除渠料定華盛頓公約將卒被撕毁而海上軍縮終將放棄届時所謂軍縮者所謂非戰公約者將如何乎而英帝國在太平洋之部份又將如何乎渠希望政府了解此問題之嚴重今之時局需要慧智不在煽惑遠東輿論以作無考慮之行爲但在堅决主張現有條約之可謀解决耳云</p>
<p>星火燎原宜早爲計</p>
<p>工黨愛倫勳爵稱一九一四年星火燎原遍及世界一九三一年之星火則未釀成同樣大禍此乃極有希望之一事渠請政府宣佈凡不使各國尊重國際義務之任何協議英國决不悦服云</p>
<p>希望尊重國聯精神</p>
<p>薛西爾勳爵亦請政府早日宣佈英國擁護國聯之决心並聲明李頓報告書如爲國聯行政院所核准則英國必贊助此報告書云</p>
<p>李頓勳爵申述意見</p>
<p>掃除異見成就可期</p>
<p>李頓勳爵亦出席上院至是起而發言首向贊助其報告書者致謝繼謂半個月内日内瓦將討論此報告書現未有催促提早考慮之必要渠不期望政府現即發表切實之聲明國聯非獲有全體同意不能有所作爲如各國先有成見則决不能獲取一致同意但時局若再任其延宕則危險殊甚渠承認中日政府對於調查團之忠實襄助調查團之提議志在建議而非一定不移調查團有一次欲作更詳細之條陳但卒未行之蓋欲集其注意於更重要之原則問題也渠贊同洛襄勳爵關於問題嚴重及應付時局應有智慧之言論渠以爲成功之最大希望在予國聯以自由之手腕渠以爲外相西門可接受此報告書而以此爲其在日内瓦之扼要點俾使其试作的建議變爲甚重要之成就云英在國聯避作領袖亦不願採單獨行動</p>
<p>陸相海爾珊勳爵代表政府發言謂數年前渠遊東京參加太平洋交誼大會渠乃知時局之困難今李頓報告書以明白而建設的文字對於雙方皆作持平之論至可嘉尙報告書辦理一困難工作欲在國聯結搆中成立兩國間之和好關係英國對此兩國固始終希望與之友好也國聯行政院現巳定期討論故無須促其提早考慮外相西門在起程直日内瓦以前當然將有機會討論此報告書而與内閣妥議行政院所可採行最好途徑之假定計劃但英國在日内瓦之目的不在作使人注意其引導或發起之行動但在聯合他國共謀一致的政策英代表之目的尤欲勸令中日兩國政府贊成列强政策渠深知問題牽涉之嚴重與遠大在行政院考慮此報告書以前英政府未便説明其對於報告書全部或對於其某種提議之行爲渠可爲彭森璧勳爵告者渠所以不能對此問題有所宣佈者因此問題過於重大須在適當時機適當地點處理之不可爲事前之言論所拘束也云彭森璧勳爵作結束此番辯論之詞謂李頓勳爵頃所稱外相西門所執之扼要點應即爲報告書本身一語渠甚寛慰云辯論至此終畢</p>

<h3>國聯特會與日美戰爭</h3>
<p>（日本海軍少佐石丸藤太著·本報譯）</p>
<p>引起戰爭機會頗多日本當有以自處</p>
<p>叙言此次國聯特别會議若遇有最惡之事態能否引起戰爭（？）此問題極有興味可稱爲日本對國聯戰之結論余確信其甚乏可能性又以爲戰爭果起决非日本對聯盟戰之直接結果而爲美國利用日本所惹起之險惡空氣迭試其第二段第三段之對日壓迫策結果遂致引起戰爭以下當依次説明之</p>
<p>國聯之制裁無力吾觀國聯之制裁未免毫無實力在今日之狀態似乎不能引起戰爭</p>
<p>國聯規約上之制裁計分三種㈠除名㈡經濟制裁㈢兵力制裁其中以除名爲最輕决不致有戰爭之結果不待言也</p>
<p>至於經濟之制裁即須有兵力爲後援換言之即非以雖戰爭亦不辭之决心與準備不能收經濟制裁之實效故積極主張經濟制裁結局當成爲戰爭不以戰爭爲前提之經濟制裁雖行之亦無甚效力此爲關於經濟制裁之最後結論</p>
<p>故國聯對於日本若欲爲眞有效之經濟制裁至少亦須英美兩國共同具有不辭戰爭之决心與準備否則成功斷無希望至其他聯盟各國皆以協同經濟制裁爲必要所不待言但令中堅之英美兩國始終漫無定見則日本便覺其毫不足憂然則英美之態度今果如何（？）英旣絶無戰爭之氣勢美國則輿論不欲戰爭即使大海軍論者勉强爲戰爭之主張顧在海軍實力不足之今日亦不能單獨從事戰爭故最近數年間暫時可保無事</p>
<p>若第三種之兵力制裁果能實見施行當然最有功效但其實行極爲困難在國聯規約上殊少實現之希望即就國聯規約言之關於兵力制裁並未作爲聯盟國之當然義務定有必須奉行之明文不過間接規定以爲可得行之及得有行之之時而巳此觀於規約第十六條第二項即可明瞭其實際者也原文如左</p>
<p>（國聯理事會遇有前項事情爲擁護國聯約束計凡兵力足用之聯盟各國有按照陸海空軍分担程度提出於關係各國政府之義務）</p>
<p>由此觀之實行兵力制裁之情事規約上雖曾豫定但所謂理事會之提案純是勸告性質並未定有絶對奉行義務故收到提案之聯盟國亦無必須照辦之義務也且於遇到如何事情方得加以兵力制裁一節亦未用明文規定換言之即聯盟各國旣無必須參與兵力制裁之義務而所謂兵力制裁亦僅言可得加之及得有行之之時蓋一種極溫和之規定也</p>
<p>因爲規定溫和故此種兵力制裁非經中堅之英美兩國持有定見不能實見施行則就此方面言亦無引起戰爭之可能性</p>
<p>胡佛式制裁不足恐美國大總統胡佛見國聯規約所定制裁旣不完備又無實力而非戰條約則并無制裁之規定其力更失之於弱因想出所謂胡佛式之制裁法提出之於國聯隨榑得國聯大多數贊成若日本對國聯戰情形最惡時此種制裁法有被其采用之可能</p>
<p>此種制裁法所以認爲在國際關係中防止使用兵力之最良方法者因其主旨在使凡有蔑視和平條約徑自訴諸戰爭而得之結果一切歸於毫無價値此經定有明文并載在本年三月十一日國聯總會决議中</p>
<p>（凡以反於國聯規約或非戰條約之手段所實現之一切事態·條約·或協定各聯盟國負有槪不承認之義務）</p>
<p>換言之即日本在滿洲之行動旣爲反於國聯規約非戰條約者則從不承認滿洲國之實現起凡有日滿議定書以及今後日滿間之條約·協定并滿洲與日本以外之國所結之條約·協定一槪不予承認</p>
<p>此種裁法若使美國當局加以説明彼將謂意在避去兵力制裁·經濟制裁故改用訴諸世界輿論之道德制裁其所以避去兵力制裁者以爲旣經訂定非戰條約若再以兵力爲制裁未免於理不合也然則何以不用經濟制裁（？）曰由政府公然命令經濟絶交結局當引起戰爭且僅一國經濟絶交效果甚少非各國一同實行不可若欲使各國一同實行則决定誰爲侵略國之困難問題又起即决定誰爲侵略國矣然欲各國一同實行仍爲至難之事又經濟絶交之結果蒙惡影響者轉爲非戰鬥員與戰鬥員反無多大關係凡此諸點皆不釆經濟制裁之理由也然則胡佛式制裁法之效果果如何乎（？）記史汀生曾以（日本可謂侵略國）爲題作如下之演説以叙述此種制裁之功德</p>
<p>（不認侵略結果之宣言在侵略者視之或以爲無足重輕亦未可定然旣由美國政府首唱且網羅全世界文明各國相率而主張不承認則實爲國際絶未經見之重大事件何也因世界之輿論以如此方法組織且下全體動員令固亘古以來所罕聞也）</p>
<p>但如史汀生所言果能使日本屈服乎（？）吾有以知其必不然也何也以我日本國民意志堅决斷不爲空言所搖動也美國人白雷耳士福特蓋嘗言之其言曰（當美國人埋頭於砂中之際日本人仍是取其所可取者）因此之故以美國可侖比亞大學校長巴德拉博士爲會長之經濟制裁委員會其會中幹事古拉古博士等曾提出一案内容大致如左</p>
<p>㈠對於違反協約者各國應加以道德之壓迫</p>
<p>㈡若尙有繼續違反協約之國則當另籌對付方法即（甲）妨害其軍事行動（乙）使其國内産業與商業發生危險但各國應取一致之行動</p>
<p>然妨害違反協約國之軍事行動終不免近於戰爭行爲至使國内産業與商業陷於危險且幾與經濟絶交無異矣由是以思則胡佛式制裁法對於其所欲避之經濟絶交仍含有可能性質而其所欲防止之戰爭結局亦終歸難免是則應當注意者也</p>
<p>要之胡佛式制裁法各國果能協力繼續實行則日本國内當增加債務對外當信用掃地準備金當失去大部分金圓匯價當慘落政府當陷於萬難維持之苦境此日本於商業經濟財政各方面所受之損害最爲顯著者也然欲發生此種結果自以各國和衷忍耐拚得犧牲爲必要此事言之甚易行之綦難非英美兩國先有决戰之豫備以爲各國援助不能奏功於是日本終覺胡佛式制裁法不足深懼則以其類似空言故（未完）</p>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<p>特載</p>
<h3>一個比較科學化的敎學指導計劃（二）杜剛</h3>
<p>㈠敎學指導的組織應成爲敎育研究的中心近三十年來敎育學術的各方面如智慧測騐敎育測騐譯程編　敎學制度敎學技術等等都有長足的進步就是比較發展遲緩的敎學指導也頗有日新月異之勢最近且有敎學指導應側重研究的主張其實從事實上講敎學指導的組織如成爲研究的中心指導員如成爲敎育研究的專家那末自然會獲得敎師的信仰自然會領導敎師向改進敎學的人道上邁進</p>
<p>一敎學指導的方法應充分科學化所謂敎學指導的科學化并非只運用了評點標準視察紀綠卡以及輔導記錄卡等等巳算盡其能事了其實科學化的最重要條件是可測量的有簽禮依據的有系統計劃的如在進行敎學指導之前先調查敎學的效果診斷其缺陷分析其原因然後根據缺陷原因擬訂指導方案以捕救之　測量其結果藉以估計敎學指導的效率</p>
<p>㈢從消極的批評到積極的輔導指導員不只是個視察者還應是個輔導者對於敎師不能只予以消極的批評使失却勇氣和自信却處以應予以積極的鼓勵同情的輔助使之能獨創和進步這幾句話説起來似乎很容易實行起來却到處會碰到困難如指導員對於敎育研究自己不甚感到興趣敎學指導的組織本身不能成爲研究的中心則如何能獲得敎師的信仰而收指導的功效指導員如無科學化的方法和計劃又如何着手進行就是着手進行了也不過是漫無依據徒憑個人主觀的意見下藥未必對症罷了所以要做到積極的輔導還須先使敎學指導的組織成爲研究中心敎學指導的方法儘　科學化普通敎學指導方案中大槪是先提出幾條原則然後再規定相當於原則的辦法原則未必諸統抽象無裨於實際敎學辦法又過於瑣碎令人不知從何着手如何進行因此作者提出上述三個努力方向後就接着叙述一個較有系統的敎學指導計劃</p>
<p>㈠敎學指導的第一步應該擬訂敎學目標</p>
<p>㈡敎學目標旣已確定第二步應着手調查敎學結果敎學指導的最後目的是增進學習的效果那末自然先應調查學習的何方面發生缺陷需要增進此　調查應繼續定期舉行</p>
<p>㈢旣經精密的調查後指導員更應進一步診斷其缺陷分析原因所在</p>
<p>㈣指導員應根據缺陷的原因擬訂指導方案以改進之擬訂時須參照最優良的敎育實施法</p>
<p>㈤測量敎學指導的效果測量在敎學指導上所佔地位的重要正和在敎學過程中所佔的地位相同指導員對於指導的效果須有確切的認識然後對於指導技術知所改進和選擇</p>
<p>㈥在敎學指導的研究和實施上應儘量運用科學方法茲再分述於下</p>
<p>要聞</p>

<p>胡何包徐四位先生文壇　　宿將小説界之老前輩！</p>
<p>近因他們大都從事於政治生活而無暇再及著述●●以致文壇减色藝林蕭條一般小説迷都感到寂莫本局有感於是多方請託得四先生允許始克成此鉅著你若一看此書則甜酸苦辣各味備嚐喜怒哀樂不由自主喜書中描寫幾個文士，因爲腦筋新了過頭，閙出種種可笑的事來，如樂天翁提倡剪鬚運動，柳如聲兄弟發明漫畫影片，及特别人種論，黄益齋組織接吻會，李光華徐亞男發明萬里姞婚法，程誠之提倡學生殺先生，火立之實行公開性交····等等，在别人以爲不可能及大逆不道的事，他們却都能説出充足的理由而至實行，看了眞令人噴飯，著者胡寄塵（懷琛）先生是國學名家，他以雋雅的文筆，來寫這種滑稽的事，好像八十歲老頭子扮子面孔談戀愛一樣，更使人發鬆到極點</p>

<p>怒何海鳴先生從事政治生活有年，所以對於軍政界秘聞軼事，無不瞭如指掌，又熟識娼門，描寫娼門中之種種，體貼入微，文藝界稱爲娼門文學的獨手，本書是描寫北平一個大政客的家庭事實，極盡曲折熱閙之能事，中有團長嫖院以春藥壯慾摧殘妓女，妻妾爭風怒爭螟子，主婢同姦蹂躪童貞，老鴇貪金虐待病妓····等等，寫來於旖旎風光之中又含一種忿忿不平之氣，不脱本書（怒）之題旨，眞屬難能可貴，一讀此書，包你眥烈髮指，變成一個怒目金剛。</p>

<h3>善果藏</h3>
<p>— 最記</p>
<p>善果藏是樂善堂代募捐册題名·相老人親書啓事·如次··</p>
<p>（欽奉當今敎宗庇吾十一世·訓誥聖敎之事蹟云云··意謂傅敎區建設士女精修新院·求合於國族所宜·時勢所需·亦爲主敎者職思其居神聖之要務。今本區（江蘇海門華籍主敎區）爲養成主祭人才·幸荷美邦捐助。置有主心小秧田一所其他博愛善舉，有利民生敎務之進行，如顧病，憐貧，撫嬰。安老，講要理，敎經言，從幼學幼稚園至女子高中以上各主任，非得專門女士，赤心忠良一無家累，不爲功者，苦尙闕如！</p>
<p>所幸區内。仰承聖召，願誓福音三絶者。不乏其人。僉謂亟宜奉聖女嬰仿耶穌小德肋撒爲主保，建設婦女精修院，以安集而陶成之分任之。惟本區濱江北，頻遭海盜及共匪，其勢不能不呼籲江南父老兄弟，助成此博愛之功焉。一面院規，規定··每日兩修女恭預聖祭領聖事，爲諸恩人祈求天主申福無疆··不愆不忘！）</p>
<p>相老人在文中特稱（聖女嬰仿耶穌小德肋撒），値得介紹讀語錄者，略略知道是如何的人物··如明悉後，有求必應，可保證的！</p>
<p>相老人對我講過··（假如有一位西洋太太和小姐來見我，我至多起身招待，點點頭罷了！可是這位聖女，千千萬萬的聖敎徒向伊致敬··我老人當然不能例外！因爲伊的德行如此高超，能翕合救世主的聖意··不像一般人物自尊自大！溫良謙卑，倒成了現代世界已故偉人中，最偉大的一位聖人呢！）每逢宗敎難題發生，相老人常説··（請這位大聖女轉求··我們不過是小走卒啊！）</p>
<p>相老人年將九十時，親譯聖女自傳，（靈心小史）。又曾書聯，表示敬禮：（祈爾萬陣玫瑰雨：啓予一片赤子心）</p>
<p>（備考）相老人譯（靈心小史），上海土山灣印書館刋行，近將三版矣。</p>
<h3>東方與西方</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>｜依賴與獨立｜</p>
<p>談到東方與西方，有一個顧著的不同點，便是依賴性與獨立性。這二種根性，造成了二種不同的民族，！柔弱與剛强。</p>
<p>在東方，不乏以布施乞丐爲唯一功德的慈善家，而西方的慈善家則反是。曾有一個中國人與一個西友去同游杭州。杭州的乞丐，甲於天下，是三百六十行之外的一種特殊的職業。有不少窮苦的小孩，從小父母就敎以求乞的技能，在街頭奔走。倘你游玩到杭州，那末，你覺得唯一阻你淸興的，便是滿山滿街的乞丐。那時中國人與其西友同游至靈隠，有一個小孩向他們求乞，追隨有半里多路，起初大家不給，後來中國人終究是中國人，因不忍而給他一個銅子，那西友就説··（我們剛才給他的敎訓現在統給你毁了。這不是一個銅子的問題，而是他終身的問題。你這是害他，！養成他的依賴性，不是救他。）言下不勝惋惜。同是一件事，同是爲計那小</p>
<h3>社會斷片</h3>
<p>— 啟沃</p>
<p>在理髮室裏</p>
<p>理髮師給他倒上一杯茶·（哼！茶杯是日本貨，我不喝！）他側下頭看了看茶杯底，這樣傲然地説着·</p>
<p>一瞬·理髮師給他梳着頭髮問··（先生，還是照樣分開嗎）</p>
<p>（唔）·</p>
<p>（哈，先生，又得用日本剪子哩！）</p>
<p>（什麽？剪刀是日本貨嗎？不行！没有别國貨嗎？）</p>
<p>（不！先生，理髮店用的都是日貨剪刀，也只有日貨好。先生要不然你就剃光頭，倒可以不用日本剪刀·）</p>
<p>（啊···那···還是照樣分開···景且用一次吧···）</p>
<p>孩，就可以看出東方與西方民族性的不同。西人重視獨立，而中國東方之一部份｜則不免於依賴。你看，西方所發明的代步物是自動車，而東方日本一所發明的是人力車，兩者之間，相去萬倍。這是小事，更從其大者言之，西方對付人家的武器是（飛機，）（戰艦，）（坦克車，）自我主張··而東方所以禦敵的武器則是（絶食，）（通電，）一發文告，）希望取得人家的哀憐。姑不問是一國的事，或是一個工廠的事，是否用（絶食）（通電）（發文告）等弱者行爲可以取得勝利，雖孺子亦知其無成，然而居然發現於二十世紀的政治史上，這不是奴隸性的表現，東方的恥辱嗎？</p>
<h3>向後轉的時代</h3>
<p>— 傳紅</p>
<p>｜社會裏發現着｜</p>
<p>一般人似乎都這樣説··（時代在前進着）！其實，時代何曾在前進着呢？我們只要在社會裏，偶一留神，發現的却都是一些（向後轉）的現狀，時代大槪是已應了（物極必反）的那句話。</p>
<p>在這裏我們先從摩登的女人們説起··在最初，從舊的轉到新的時候，女人們只怕衣裳的不短·領子不矮·對於從前古式的旗裝，却又是那樣的厭棄，然而到了現代呢？衣裳是拚命的往下拉，領子是絶端的向上聳，高跟鞋，至少有一些滿淸時代高底鞋的色彩。一切都漸漸的向後頭跑，至於男人，西瓜皮尖小帽，紥褲管，淺口鞋，他們也極力的在復古，時代又那裏是（前進着？</p>
<p>語體文在剛倡行的時候，小鳥呌，也可以做兩首詩，猫狗吵，也可以做一篇散文，漪歟盛哉，（的嗎了那）是那樣値得大家供奉着··可是時至今日·幹語體文的新人物·大家都掉轉筆管在圈點什麽南宋詞，或是唐詩了。這一切又是怎麽一回事？在最近·那一些時人聞人們，大家又在幹什麽（時輪金剛法會）了鑼鼓聲喧，香烟繚繞，在這個時代裏，我們又那裏會相信有這種怪現狀發生呢？然而事實，却明顯的排在我們眼前，時代却只是向後轉着呢！</p>
<h3>同學的未婚妻</h3>
<p>— 沈枕月</p>
<p>｜恶家庭的童養媳生命｜</p>
<p>這是十六年前的事實··這時我在距離我家不遠的小學校裏唸書我每天上學校裏去，總是要經過我那同學趙海文的門前·有時放學回來，我那同學趙海文終是邀我到他家裏去吃餅乾··要洋娃娃·我因爲很害怕他的母親，所以雖然進去，終是不敢久戀。</p>
<p>最奇怪是趙海文的未婚妻，（童養媳）伊這年是十歳，十歲的小女兒，當然是一個天眞爛漫，活潑玲瓏的好寳寳。但是我始終没有見過伊的笑臉，更没有見過伊和人玩耍，祗見伊一顆淚珠，常常浸紅了伊的眼皮。</p>
<p>道天我上學去的時候。正經過趙海文的門前，忽然聽得一種很悽慘的聲音，似乎是趙海文的未婚妻哭着喊着··（痛啊···媽媽饒饒我···）還夾雜着一種劈劈拍拍似乎竹爿敲人的聲音。</p>
<p>學校裏點名了，每天必到的趙海文，今天不知爲了什麽事情，忽然不到。時候巳正午了，我回家去午餐了，我又經過趙海文的門前，我不覺吃了驚，原來我那同學趙海文在門口哭着，我忙去安慰他和詢問他哭的原因，那海文這樣的回答我··（伊早上敲碎了一隻碗，所以被我媽媽打死了。）</p>
<p>短訊本埠大陸商塲五樓德商華達藥房所經理德國瑪爾入藥廠之獅力牌牛肉汁雞汁，係用最新冷榨法製造，功能增精補血，開胃　神，爲可靠之常服補品，故營業之盛，亦首屈一指，購者須加以注意，凡有一獅字固非本品，有一力字亦非本品，要認淸獅力牌三字，方爲眞德國貨云，</p>
<h3>死之岔道（四）</h3>
<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>二適應了時代以後</p>
<p>（愛姑·····）</p>
<p>從農家的童養媳進而爲城市大戸人家的婢女的愛姑，正坐在外房的窗前一隻有彈性的椅子裏，對着鏡臺上金光橙亮的小擺鐘呆看，一，二，三，···默默的一壁聽它狠淸圓的敲，一壁記數，數到十，鐘聲憂然而止，伊纔聽得間壁，|韓大少奶的臥室|裏，有輕嗔薄怒的聲氣，喊（愛姑。）愛姑如夢方覺地立起來，答應一個㕭字，急忙掀開綠絲緩的門窗，放低了脚步，走進臥室去，望到金光橙亮的床上，有一位天仙似的女人，給薄霧輕烟似的珠羅紗帳子籠罩着，面孔向外，雖不能瞧得眞切，但是己非昨天初相見的細眉毛，白裏泛紅，紅裏泛白的兩頰，猩紅的嘴唇，倘然不聽伊的聲音，幾乎要疑心是另一女人了。伊無暇去研究變態的所以然來，要緊聽伊的後命，見伊從粉紅色薄綢的被　裏，伸出一隻不豐腴的手來，向床前夜壺箱上指指説··</p>
<p>（關了燈！）</p>
<p>這個差使，使愛姑難窘的幾乎哭出來，伊雖在昨夜從聰明的觀察上，懂得電燈的神秘，只消用手把牆上一塊銅板上一個小鈕頭撳了一下，就可以開，再撳一下，也就可以關的。但是這臥室裏，四面牆壁上，都是夏天在鄉間見慣的一絲不掛的游水的孩子的畫，和意象中的洋婆，粗枝大葉的花紋襯託着，再也找不到一個小鈕頭。</p>
<p>（笨貨！）韓大少奶鄙夷不屑的神氣，把半個身子撑起來説着，在夜壼箱上摸到一個金光橙亮的小葫蘆，咕噥着説··（開關在這裡啊。）擦的一聲，夜壼箱上一盞游水孩子手裡捧着一盤白萄萄，倏的没有黄光了。愛姑仔細向小葫蘆看了幾眼，莫名其妙的記憶着··一這也是個開關的機關。一</p>

<h3>厘軟拆穏輔幣漲｜銅元遽縮二千五百文｜</h3>
<p>連日金融市况自經十底長期欵歸納終了後外界各商業以週轉無望市上拮据自不待言而銀錢業集中現欵不肯儘最供應明知市面在短時間内無活動可能故對種種營業上貿易亦略事減縮如是銀洋需途益形遜色誠恐銀洋趨勢將日現平疲之象</p>
<p>厘微減低拆高一分（洋厘）早市厘價爲七錢零六厘較前午小去二毫半午市續小一毫二忽半爲七錢零五厘八毫七忽半結果兩市間共跌三毫七忽半形勢仍無若何變化（銀拆）早午兩市俱開五分較前日改昻一分劃頭加水因頭襯過剩卽白劃亦無人受遑論加水</p>
<p>角洋均漲銅元續縮江南小洋早市爲六錢一分八厘較前午又好一厘午市更較早市漲一厘計爲六錢一分九厘結果共漲二厘交易早市五千五百角午市七千五百角廣東小洋早市五錢九分八厘七毫半較前日午市續又好起一厘午市與早市雷同交易早市十四萬五千角午市三萬角銅元因買氣鼎盛多方略事居奇結果重縮二千五百文爲四百二十千文交易五萬零八百餘串文</p>

<h3>長期消息尾聲</h3>
<p>本届十底到期之長期存放各種欵項大部分完全由於月内歸納淸楚然未能如期淸了者尙有不少昨據該業人言能還者不拘多寡隨便付償其不敷之處祇得轉入往來以便隨時找償此項數額當亦可觀核計不下二三百萬現由銀行方面設法或以信用品抵做押欵以出借據訂期償還或再轉短期（如二月三日等）放欵以資陸續凑繳所有新做交易則完全未有見聞可見現在放欵果然不易而要求放欵賴以週轉者更爲難堪焉</p>

<h3>日煤在滬傾銷實况</h3>
<p>▲開平煤大受影響</p>
<p>近來日煤在我國市塲因欲奪回其（九一八）以前固有之銷路特將撫順·元山·神田·池野·各貨一跌再跌大事傾銷期達彼擾亂目下煤市危害我國經濟之目的茲爲使國人澈底明瞭日煤傾銷實况起見再就各方調查所得披露於後▲日煤價一跌再跌</p>
<p>撫順煤由大連到滬售價爲十兩零六錢而此價格之中除去運費一兩三錢半碼頭費六錢佣金至少五錢依此數計之每噸實價僅八兩一錢更如池野一種刻僅售四兩而此四兩之中除去運費等三項外僅餘一兩五錢矣其餘元山·神田·等十餘種亦與池野等貨相仿謂非傾銷其誰信之</p>
<p>▲開平煤大受影響</p>
<p>申時社記者昨赴開濼煤礦公司實地調查據該公司重要職員語記者云開平二號屑於本年一月七日尙售十兩零七錢半今因撫順及日煤之傾銷已逐步减退至六兩五錢而各地存貨秦皇島尙有六十餘萬噸漢口十三萬餘噸蕪湖以下十五萬噸左右總計約達百萬噸之鉅外間不明情形者有謂開平因缺少車輛不敷運輸殊不知該公司自受傾銷影響以來將原有之運煤車六百輛已向路局退夫二百輛矣</p>
<p>▲煤斤運輸費比較</p>
<p>或謂運價太貴以致華煤滯銷但據記者調查結果與外間所傳者亦大相徑庭開平及開平以外之數種運費於下開平·○一五一三元中興·○○五元井陘○○六八五元六河溝·○○八二五元以上運費均係每噸每公哩計算價旣平平可見滯銷仍係日煤傾銷故也且國煤如長興等實無一不受影響開平特其尤者耳長此以往我國如不亟圖補救非但危害煤業因此搖動全國經濟地位前途不堪設想矣</p>

<p>丙、財政委員會之控制財政</p>
<p>六、預算案獲得其所必需之核核准後、工部局財務處之所應注意者、不僅在於支出之數、並未超過預算規定、且其用途以所經核准者爲限、抑亦須使此種用途、非經依照該處所授權力辦理、不得支出、</p>
<p>七、工部局財政之全部管理、集中於財務處、該處爲支付欵項及保管賬目之唯一負責機關、故其所處地位、足以切實限制其他各部份之費用財務處處長之説帖、又將該處所有控制財政之原則與方法、説明如左、</p>
<p>（董事會曾經裁决、謂一種指定支出之列入預算、並非意爲卽此核准、可將關於此項支出之計畫卽付諸實行、（註三）、故在實行各該項計畫以前必須先由有關係之各處處長、提出詳細建議、設係關於建築工程、則應連同圖樣、遞請正式核准、倘祇牽涉銀三百兩、或不及三百兩、而又無原則關係者、則一經塡送請准購辦物品册、卽視爲業巳提出建議、</p>
<p>説帖旋進而叙述各種簿册、爲工部局所用以控制各部份之用途、並以編製該局之財政紀錄者、就鄙人現在之目的而論、祇須提及其中之二種、卽一請准購辦物品册）及（固定需欵豋記册）、説帖之叙述此兩種簿册如左</p>
<p>（請准購辦物品册）此種簿册、爲全部份控制財政辦法之基礎、故糜施以極爲嚴密之審查與監督、其最初所達之目的如左</p>
<p>㈠切實記載與註册有關係部份之需要</p>
<p>㈡因册内列有預算等項、足以恊𦔳限制費用、使以可能之最獗狹範圍爲限、</p>
<p>㈢佐以各部份之定貨册、足使所有未償債務、便於估計、</p>
<p>各部份之請准購辦物品册、由各該部份自行編製、按期送交財務處處長將其所列各欵、審查認可、</p>
<p>財務處處長將所有支出各欵逐一審查、遇必要時、並將必需批評之任何事項、提出報告、一九二九年以前、請准購辦物品册、孫由財務處處長簽署、送由工部局總辦、轉呈有關係之委員會、但自一九二九年起、該册之登記無誤、由財務處處長對於董事會負責、並僅將依照上文所摘叙之財政條例、而經該處長認爲宜報告者、向董事會報告（註四）</p>
<p>固定需欵豋記册、此册爲前項簿册之附屬物、其目的在將有例行性質之按期固定費用、彙集於固定需欵項下、每一此項費用、一經登入請准購辦物品册内、卽由財務處處長附註數語、表明准將該項費用列入固定需欵豋記册内、經如是核准以後、此項債務卽可列入固定需欵豋記册將來之欵項支出、僅爲一種例行事務、）</p>
<p>八、上文所述辦法、使財務處對於其他各處需用之欵得行使一種甚爲完全且有效力之控制、但行使此項控制權之責任、在於爲財務處長官之財務處處長、至於財務委員會、及與各部份有關係之任何常務委員會、則均未切實分負控制費用之責、財務處處長固巳提明、將請准購辦物品册送交各委員會之辦法、業經棄而不用、</p>
<p>九、在規定財務處處長之職務條例内、該處長對於各部份請准購辦物品所可行使之職權、經叙述如左、</p>
<p>該處長應審查各部份之請准購辦物品册及付欵册設使請用之欵、未經列入預算、或未得董事會認可、則該處長有拒絶撥付之權、</p>
<p>上項規定、係授權財務處處長、使得堅令未經列入預算之所擬任何支出、必須陳請董事會或委員會核准、但如所擬支出、預料必能獲得其所需要之核准、亦顯然可由該處酌予通過、</p>
<p>丁、財政委員會之責任</p>
<p>一○、董事會所有處置公欵之權其經地産章程第二十五條如何規定、上文業已引述、該條條文似故意如此訂立、而使董事會不致過受預算案内所定詳細支出條目之拘束、董事會得（酌照業經通過之預算、支配公欵、）但不得超過年會所准支出之總數、有權議决籌撥欵項之唯一團體、爲運用不便之納税人大會、故爲董事會留有若干斟酌辦理之餘地、顯屬必要、董事會之須將業經審查之上年支出帳目、提交在四月間舉行之年會、係使業經預算决議案認可之各項預算、得有被相當尊重之保證、通過核准所提上年帳目之决議案、係使超過預算案内任何項下所列數目之支出、由納税人正式認可、</p>
<p>一一、動用預算决議案内所準備之欵項、其必須有若干伸縮餘地、誠無疑義、但如須許其伸縮則爲尊重預算案及節省起見、監督支出、顯屬一種重要任務、並可望由財政委員會担承此項任務之一大部份、詳細之監督工作、因必須交由財務處處長辦理、但關於此種監督之情形、財政委員會似應與財務處處長有密切之接洽、如此則關於政策之進行、可由該委員會承認其黹○於董事會所負之責、且能担保、謂歷任財務處處長之對於支出均能維持所需要之注意、不寗唯是、設使一種所擬支出、在未獲得特别認可以前、財務處處長認爲必須加以制止者、該處長亦能深信財政委員會之必能予以認可與贊助、</p>
<p>所以上章所論、關於各委員會與各處處長間宜有切實接觸之普通原則、似對於財政委員會與財務處處長間所有關係、爲特殊適用、</p>
<p>一二、依照現有情况、顯然可見財政委員會工作之最要部份、係在將預算案提交四月間舉行之納税人年會以前、對於編製該預算案所盡之任務、且在一年之中、該委員會並非按期開會、銓叙委員會、爲一切關於職員事項問題所應先交其考量之委員會、設立此種委員會之結果似已將財政委員會前此所有任務取銷、乃使其在管理工部局之一般財政方面、較爲不繼續切實參預、</p>
<p>戊，財政委員會職責之界限</p>
<p>一三、在英國市府之内、財政委員會所處地位、殊爲重要市府之設立財政委員會、早已成爲習慣、而此種習債、則又經十九世紀後半期之地方政府法令承認、州郡議事會之財政委員會經規定爲必須設立、並授以特别職權、有時經解釋爲、得將其他委員會之建議予以否决者、使一市議會之任何委員會、得處於此種特殊地位、固顯然有可反對之處、但須知英國地方政府之財政、因設有財政委員會、而大受裨益、此項委員會、係以担承監督財政之普通職務、並須將牽涉用欵之一切建議、在未經市議會自身表决以前、就財政方面立論、向市議會提出報告、</p>
<p>一四、英國法規所載關於財政委員會任務之各項規定、業經他國之市政法規、酌改其程式而採用、爲舉證例起見、鄙人茲將杜蘭斯窪爾市政法規所載關於財政委員會之各項規定提出、（註五）依照該法規之規定、（市議會應隨時組織財政委員會、以調節並控制市議會之財政）、（任何支出、倘未列入財政委員會所遞、並經市議會核准之詳細預算者、不得撥付）、所應注意者、此項規定、通常爲市議會規則或財政委員會之職權範圍所補充、而使財政委員會、必須履行一種義務、卽無論財政委員會自身、對於應請撥欵之建議、贊同與否、該委員會須造具此項建議所需費用之預算遞交市議會、關於財政問題、財政委員會通常負爲市議會顧問之責任、務使該委員會造送前項預算之特殊目的、在令牽涉支出之建議、倘未經財政委員會造送所需費用之預算不付表决、（未完）</p>

<h3>金剛石愼永</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>物以希爲貴，金剛石（ＤiaＭond）因爲牠産量的少，並且加上牠有那最會引誘人的燦爛的光芒，所以世界上最寳貴而人人羨慕渴望的就要算那可以做飾物的一種金剛石了，其實呢，牠不過是一塊没有生命的礦石罷了，</p>
<p>金剛石多爲八面或十二面等軸系的結晶禮，純粹的是透明無色，有時也略含雜質，就呈黄，紅，綠或褐色，並且折光的能力亦很强，能反射種種燦爛的光彩，</p>
<p>牠在各物質中，硬度最高，所以能夠用爲鑽礦，至於牠的化學成分呢·係純粹的碳素（Ｃarbon），我們若把金剛石加熱，就可以看見牠漸漸地澎漲，而變成一種黑色的物質，再繼續的熱加，就氧化合成二氧化碳氣，這試騐就可以看出牠是純粹碳素而無疑了，</p>
<p>天然的金剛石多産在河海沿岸的砂礫裏面··在南亞非利加河（ＳouthＡfria)最多·約占總産額百分之九十，在印度·巴西及我國山東沂州南鄕李家莊一帶也有，不過在我國所産的，是一種黑金剛石</p>
<p>原來金剛石有多種，現在且把各種及其效用分述於后··</p>
<p>愛河即是恨海！青年慎毋墮落！</p>
<p>㈠黑金剛石（Ｃarbonado）｜是一種黑色的結晶體，其性質頂堅硬·所以不能劈開，祇能用於金剛石的穿巖機中，用牠穿地洞及開礦，</p>
<p>㈡鑽石屑(Ｂort)｜有輻射纖維構造，色很濃，表面常爲球形，可以供砥磨之用，</p>
<p>㈢結晶金剛石｜這種若是色澤光彩的，就可以做世人最羨的飾物··暗的，就祇能用牠切玻璃了，</p>
<p>這種結晶金剛石｜用以做飾品的，更賴人工磨琢，磨琢成多數的琢面，帮助反射光彩的實現，其磨琢式有三··　　㈠玫瑰式（Ｒosette）｜有一平面爲底面，側面成數三角形，</p>
<p>㈡光明式（Ｂrilliant）｜係利用金剛石劈開琢成，</p>
<p>㈢橄欖式（Ｂriolett）｜成橄欖形，　　至於牠的結成法，還不十分明瞭，不過現在有一種製造假金剛石的方法，是法國的一個大化學家茅遜（Ｍaissan）所發明的，</p>
<p>他的方法是拿鐵加熱到攝氏一千三百度以上，使鐵溶成液體··再把碳加入，再加熱，使牠也溶在鐵液裏面，然後使這碳和鐵的混合液體遇冷，凝成固體，當凝固時牠的體積漸漸縮小，同時在鐵裏面的碳，受了極大的壓力，變成了金剛石，這金剛石不會溶化在鹽酸裏，所以把牠浸入鹽酸裏，鐵就受溶解，金剛石乃成，</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3>談談提倡短衣問題</h3>
<p>— 白</p>
<p>服裝是社會限象的一種。人的生活的一部份，因着這種關係，我們就不能不加以注意，誰也不能説；我不要穿衣，旣要穿衣，就不得不拿來研究一番，過去不是時常有着研究的結果麽，男服雖則變動尙少，然也有着許多顯著的差别，馬褂穿的人逐漸減少了亦可證明，人終竟是進步的啊、看女人的服裝吧</p>
<p>近代的女人隨着生活程度增高的情形之下，益形表現着，被視爲玩物和娛樂的器具，短衣變爲旗袍，短袍一翻又變爲長袍，因爲這是適於舞蹈·閑步做男人的伴隨的，這些進步正是相反的，是進步的障碍。以上是我的服裝泛論，結論是必須確立服裝的正確定則，應該是適於身體的制定··</p>
<p>一、男子應採用廣東式短衣，形似學生裝，而無學生裝的不便，束壓胸部的弊病可以免去，舉手的不便，亦可避名。且學生裝稍有縐摺，即現不整的形狀，而該項短衣則較爲牽就。故我於男子服裝，主張（廣東論）。</p>
<p>二、女子在這個社會裏脱不掉商品的資格，所以她們的服裝應以博取美觀爲條件，我也不去另立新裝樣式，僅就原有的幾種衣服加以選擇··現行的長旗袍我是反對的因爲迷醉男人的雙腿，同時是表示女人美的曲綫被掩蓋了，不能讓她自由地擺出來任人欣賞，這些都是女子的（威權，）决不應把她埋没，可是，過於緊小的束縛生理發展的製法是要不得的。這一項意見，不是我個人的意見，而是有着多數人的意見爲依據的。　　三、兒童的衣着，也應予以確定，依我的觀察最好是海軍裝，未成年的兒童都很適宜。</p>
<p>在（提倡短衣）的標題下我是被吸引住了，但是極積的提出三個短衣的意見，却不知能夠得到怎樣的評價，贊成與異議惟有俟諸公判了。</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>
<h3>商情</h3>
<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>好久没有去他們家裏了。現在忽接到莉英的電話邀我去談談，可是我最怕就是訪友作客，因爲動輒要碰到一般神氣十足的看門將軍來難爲你一下，（推車撞壁）的權請門外站立一下，何况莉英家又是門警森嚴呢？但是旣蒙主人的誠意，怎能呌我不去！</p>
<p>我們從生活近况開始講起，一直談到了十分嚴重性的關於國家大事··</p>
<p>（大槪你也是提倡布衣運動的吧，欽佩欽佩！）莉英看了我穿的一件自由布長衫説··（你看，現在每條馬路裏依然密密層層掛滿了大减價的旗子，聰敏的老閶，也是利用着氣候名目繁多的呌做春季大减價，冬季····尤其在這外貨充溢市塲而社會經濟演着一齣（空城計）的時候，於是大减價成了一個（不速之客）接二連三的舉個不停！）莉英滿面笑容手裏又很靈活的打着一件粉紅色的外套説道·</p>
<p>（這話不錯，埀危的社會，動搖得多麽可怕呀！）我深深地長嘆了一聲。　　（並且現在所謂大减價，完全仇貨在那裏活躍，奸商乘此時機，藉大減價之名，而爲傾銷仇貨的勾當，也就是坐收利市三倍之奇效；所以我簡直不敢出去買辦東西，一不當心就會投進他們的網裏！）</p>
<p>（是的，分明仇貨改頭換面，偏要説得冠冕堂皇的完全國貨，提倡國貨撲朔迷離地來蒙蔽顧客，奸商之奸，死有餘辜！）</p>
<p>（呀！我們的傭人眞太可憐啦，！動他們呢，而他們總是笑嘻嘻的道··（價廉物美，機會難得。）唉｜你想吧，他們那會曉得帝國主義者正用着向我們</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>吸收　的經濟畫夜不息在兵工廠裏大量的製造慘殺我們滅亡我們的兇器！他們更那會知道新聞紙上巳經滿載着敵兵在津演習巷戰，或在平檢閲會操的消息｜）</p>
<p>莉，總之，國家民族的出路，積極的是要促進政治走上軌道，然後可以言振興國家生産事業。消極的是大家毅然决然的一致拿出天良來抵制仇貨，這可説是我們唯一的武器！倘再發現利令智昏的奸商，我們也可以拿（安内攘外）的最後辦法來對付他們，何必徒作憤懣呢？我們要築建鞏固廣大的陣線，一致奮勇向前衝去，國難還可藉此打破，豈僅一仇貨之不能澈底抵制？）</p>
<p>黑幕</p>
<h3>和藹的房東太太人</h3>
<p>一個没有女人的男子在上海求生活，比吃飯問題還要難解决的，就是住的問題。肚子餓子，腰包裏只剩兩毛錢，上小館子吃洋葱麵，再不然，大餅油條隨處可得，總可鬼混過這一天··倘使你有錢而（光蛋）！就是想租一間亭子樓或是灶披間，那可别想！</p>
<p>光蛋隊伍中的Ｄ，又是充溢着土的氣味，這次初來上海，雖説腰裏纒着不少他爹爹從田裏赤脚袒臂用汗血換來的東西，照説，甚麽都應稱意了。可是這（住的問題）却重重地深深地煩惱了他整整的一個月。</p>
<p>他常常在住宅區一帶閒逛。一次，他發現一條弄堂口貼着的紅紙條子，他看明號數，帶着一顆（必然被拒）的心去詢問。這是一幢一上一下的房子，出租的是一間亭子樓，每月房金十六塊大洋，談判的結果，房東太太認爲滿意，很意外地竟然成功了。</p>
<p>與Ｄ同居的，除房東住在樓下客堂裏外··樓上前後樓各一家，陽台裝成的房間裏一家，樓梯旁邊裝成的小閣樓裏一家··樓下後廂房一家，灶披間裏一家··統計這屋子裏住着八家人；男女大小共有二十五個。</p>
<p>房東太太是一位具有道地的東方病態美的婦人。她不過三十來歲，她有（柳腰）和（蓮步），瓜子形的臉蛋，細弱的手臂，平平的胸脯，瘦瘦的身材···。人很和藹可親，常常到房裏來閒談，也請Ｄ到她房裏去坐。她告訴他，她最同情没有女人的男子，她認房東不借房子給單身男子住是極不講理，極不人道的事。她又呌Ｄ不要客氣，住在一屋，便是自家人，有困難的問題，她可以盡量帮助他。</p>
<p>房東太太不但性情溫柔，和藹可親而富於同情心，她還仁俠好客，單就每天往來於她房裏很多很的靑年的男女，尤其是夜裏，這便是一個鐵證。</p>
<p>（您的先生在那裏發財？····）Ｄ在她房裏發現一架玻璃櫉，櫉裏擺着許多大小的瓷瓶，瓶上都貼着一條寫着藥名的紅紙。</p>
<p>（唔唔｜他是研究化學的，現在做醫生。）當Ｄ問到這個問題的時候，她有些遲疑，但還是滿堆着笑容。</p>
<p>有一天黄昏時候，Ｄ從朋友家回來，在自已屋子後門口擁擠着一大堆人，人頭浮動着。他伸長了頸子朝屋裏　望，他不曉得屋裏出了甚麽亂子，用死力也擠不進去，嗓子也嚷燥了。</p>
<p>不一會，五六個武裝的中西探捕，拖出一個長衫馬褂的漢子和一個蓬髮瘦瘦的婦人，巡捕手裏拿着許多瓷瓶，聲勢汹汹的帶着走了。Ｄ還是莫明所以，惟聽見鄰舍在談論（打胎打死人····私開窰子····秘密賣淫····）</p>
<p>當一張法院封條貼在Ｄ居住的大門上的時候，他再度玩味住的煩惱了。</p>

<h3>中國人善於適應模倣陳大悲</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>如果我們有一天得到政治淸明的樂境、我們的社會能夠建設多數的演員訓練機關、在相當的敎練人材指導之下、我們一定可以得到許許多多比今天在美國銀幕上更好的演員、</p>
<p>不信嗎、没有成事實之前、我有甚麽方法可以使人笑我是發了誇大誑呢、伹是這是我由十多年導演劇戲的經騐中發見的一點眞理、我確信我們國人的表演天材確乎在任何國人之上、表演的要素就是適應、也就是模倣、日本人自以爲模倣的能力勝於西方人、但是他們比起中國人來還差一籌、姑且設一個比喻吧、你去問美國朋友們、他們曾經見過中國人説美國話説得和美國人一樣圓潤的没有、他們一定會告訴你、他們見過很多很多的人、你問英國、德國或是法國的朋友們、也一定能夠得到同樣的結果、但是你再閉目靜心默想一下、你聽見過幾個外國人、能夠完全擺脱了他們本國的土音土腔説幾句道道地地乾乾脆脆的中國話、　　這你就明白了吧、我們中國人在别的方面是不是不如他國人、我不敢强辯但是在適應或是模倣這些方面我是千準萬確相信我們中國人的能力實在超過任何一國的、</p>
<p>假如我們的國運有一天轉機、假如我們理想中的訓練計劃有一天能夠實現的話至多在五年之内我可以拿事實來證明給你看的、</p>
<p>爲甚麽我們中國人的表演藝術能夠超過世界上任何民族的成績呢、這也是很容易明白的、因爲我們中國民族的血統是極其複雜的、越複雜的血統越富有適應種種環境的特性、血統簡單的民族、在表演藝術上、無論如何努力多少總保留着一些笨頭笨腦的土氣、這些土氣就是不能夠變化不能夠適應的憑據、所以、祗有血統複雜的民族、才可得到（裝龍像龍裝虎像虎）的藝術的效果、</p>
<p>國際要聞</p>
<h3>蘇聯的兒童電影</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>蘇聯自提出了利用電影以提高國民敎育程度的口號以來、對於兒童的敎育、也認定有利用電影之必要、一九二七年在莫斯科所召集的電影會議中、决定攝製百分之二十五的兒童電影、並設立專門機關從事研究、其電影主題、常聯繋着各種（鬥爭）問題、以及其他諸眞實的社會問題、如（黄金之密）（破袖）是以救濟浮浪兒爲目的、反對浮浪兒所給與一般兒童的不良影響揭破他們空想的企圖、覺悟他們同情少年先鋒之規律的情感、同時敎他們努力於社會主義的建設、（三人）一片主要的描寫鄕村與都市的兒童以及無家可歸的兒童們參加少年先鋒隊、（大人與小孩）是描寫兒童們反對官僚主義與投機商人、而獲得兒童們的共同福利、（酒店姑娘）聯繋着禁酒運動、還有（託易克·飛爾姆）的短篇喜劇、是以動物的生活與機械爲主題、這種特殊的製作、乃是爲了、在學兒童而攝製的、</p>
<p>這種兒童電影之演出、並不需要固定的演員、可以完全利用有組織的兒童、即是一部份的俱樂部會員或一部份的少年先鋒都是頂好的演員、而導演攝影師等也只消到兒童塲所中指導攝製、</p>
<p>關於兒童電影之開映、也是有組織有計劃的、如莫斯科有名的文化電影院都定期開映兒童電影、在上映中特别爲兒童加以簡短的解説、同時在電影院的另一室内陳列着與這電影有關的圖書或新聞雜誌、</p>
<p>在此我們可以了解蘇聯政府當局對於兒童的敎化是如何的注意、對於社會主義的建設是如何的努力了、</p>
<h3>評（古屋怪人）</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>古屋怪人、ＴheＯldＤarkhouse是在美國説部中、佔了很光榮的位置的、拿我們的經騐來説、凡是用著名小説作劇本、所得的成績、常常能呌人非常滿意、因爲牠的組織、巳經早有了健全的骨骼、　　這張片子、可以算是環球公司得意之作、導演手腕、非常爽利、目光非常精細、攝影差不多完全用很暗的光線而表演却絲毫不忽、盡力表顯出神秘和恐怖、特别有許多鏡頭、拍得非常呌人看了、感到美滿、</p>
<p>這片子還有一個特長、就是化裝、在毛根和羅得力克兩人的化裝、看來、化裝術、的確呌人驚奇、那佈景山和水、表現出天然的偉大、使人｜觀象｜如身臨其境、覺得自已宇宙間的渺小、古屋内景、也極佈景之能事、</p>
<p>錦毛根的卡洛夫Ｋarloff、名爲主角、其實也並不比别人繁重多少、表漢一個莽野匹夫、作風又和科學怪人、大大的不同、眞所謂、能者無不能了、</p>
<p>其餘九個人、都很好、我巳説過、這片子是十人並重的、牠整個的美、不是一二個人的力量、只有在前半部、却利拉夫楨ＣharlesＬaughton、和麗蓮彭得Ｌilian、Ｂond的表演、略略火了一些、不過决影響不到片中的精彩、</p>
<p>這片子的確能呌人的心弦、無時不在顫動、能呌你替劇中人、急得呼出聲來、每一寸的影片、都是緊緊的握着人們的情感、</p>

<p>六萬元祇拍一部　　女演員用中國人　　天一公司演員王慧娟女士張雲喬攝</p>
<p>闊星鶴</p>
<p>好萊塢明星們薪水最大的是誰、是很容易知道的、因爲按照他們每年所付的所得税就可以查得出的、所以、島葛拉斯范朋克、瑪琳黛維絲、惠爾羅傑士、羅克、安哈婷、康絲登斯巴撒瑪、晒瑪希拉、李却巴色瑪、葛雷泰嘉寳、珍妮蓋諾、以上十個人、每年大約要付所得税十萬美金左右、爲數也就很可觀了｜</p>

<h3>替外國人澆盆冷水</h3>
<p>— 不敏</p>
<p>我在外國電影雜誌裏面、看見了一幅畫、或一串的畫、裏面畫的是一個化妝師、將一個美國人改造爲中國人、將這不幸而被改造的美國人的眉毛望上畫、將他的眼角亦往上挑、結果他就變成了一個（標準式的Ｃhinaman了、於是他居然以一代宗匠自居、自命爲奇蹟Ｍiracle眞是Ｗonderful但我看來、一點亦不像、并且什麽也不像、這種奇蹟、是太奇了、</p>
<p>這裏有一封短信、係一個美國居留的中國人寫的、他投到ＭotionＰixcture的投函欄内、還得了十個金元的奬金、我將他翻譯在下面、</p>
<p>（我係一個中國人、我在多年以前離開了故鄕、來到貴邦、在各地大學校受了多年的敎育、所以在許多問題上、我的見解可以説多半與美國人同化了、但是、我對於電影裏面描寫我們種族的地方、實在有些不敢贊同、這是我常常看見而生的感觸、尤其是在美國人裝扮成一個中國的時候、</p>
<p>（在我的祖國、我還有七個姊妹、他們都是電影迷、當他們看見佳妙而眞實的中國背景之中、用白人來充作華人、他們笑得上氣不接下氣、這眞滑稽極了、現在差不多的美國人、從電影上的指示、都知道中國女子走路、是走急促的（碎步）的、而高貴男子、都是直立將雙手鑲攏放在肚皮上的、但是他們不知道、中國人無論如何高貴、他肚子不疼的時候、他不會將雙手放在肚子上的、而中國的女子、赤不都像維多利亞時代女子的怕羞、從前裏足的時候、或有這伶仃可愛的（碎步）但現在蓮船三尺、快步如飛、以前的陳迹、今日已成廣陵散了、</p>
<p>（美國片子中尤多暗示中國人隂狠險惡之處、這亦不全實在、我隨便提起那一個的人、（殺人不貶眼）（口蜜腹劍、）多比中國人利害、所以貴邦的影片製作家、何不力求眞切、用幾位眞正的中國人、來一張確能描寫中國實情的片子呢？　　我讀完了這封信、我很想抽出一張洋信紙、照樣在打字機上打了、簽上我自己的名字、寄到美國去、可惜未必能再得那十個金元的奬金唉！</p>
<p>天一公司自從拍攝了有聲影片、中國電影界平空又多添了些外國電影界的人物、單以天一來説、有兩位是外國老　（收音機械經租人）一個是“ＣhasＨugo”許杲、一個是“ＬeonＢritton”白立登、許果在前些日子巳往英國、白立登巳將天一的收音機械收回、因爲邵醉翁不要用他的機械了、近數日來、白立登因爲那機械無人租赁、所以集合了六個外國資本家、每人拿一萬中國銀弊、合成六萬元、預備祗拍一部戲、並不是外國戲、是用中國人、中國風景、中國社會做背景、但是語言是用英語對白、導演、除他自己外、尙有一個中國人爲助手、</p>
<p>前些日子、新聞報廣告欄内有一條是（招請女演員）其中標明（須熟諳英語者）那就是白立登登的廣告、據白立登親自語記者、此番招的女演員在面貌與體格的健美方面、均極嚴格審視、稍帶病態者即不取、</p>
<p>近兩天、他們巳經在蘇杭二州採取認爲滿意的風景兩處、照成像片預備取景的參考、工作時期、一俟女演員選定、</p>
<p>就要開拍那部英語對白的中國戲了、</p>
<p>在他們未拍之先記者先來報告讀者、這外國資本的中國戲、就許是一部外國經濟實行在内地侵略的探試針、更許是有辱我國民族的惡劣片子、在他們未開始工作之先、我們可以不武斷、但是我們不得不顧慮、敬告讀者、倘若你們的親戚朋友有被選爲女演員時千萬注意到劇本的本身、若有辱我民族的劇情時、我們萬勿貪圖了萬元的薪金而賣了個人的人格辱没了中華國體、</p>

<h3>十五年來蘇聯影片趨勢｜根據ＨarryＡlanＰotamkin氏意見｜</h3>
<p>— 施誼</p>
<p>早期蘇聯影片的内容、就題旨及其取材而言、是無可非議的、但爲了當時的不成熟所限制、使其理想不克有力地實現、因此不免發生如下的兩種錯誤價値（alsevalucs)、第一、是一種極端的無産階級主義(ＥxtremeＰroletarinism)而實際則是一種小貿産階級的自身意識(ＰettybourgeoiＳelfconsciousnees)、第二、是陷於一種文學主義(Ｌiteralism)、他們需要兩方面的訓練、意識形態的和技術的、(ＩdeojogicajgＴechnical)</p>
<p>但是、如果不把蘇聯影片的這一時期、當作一個歷史的前誕生時代去研究、則我們便不免失之歪曲的錯誤、這一個時期、即蘇聯電影家們在無準備的狀態之下、從苦的認識轉換到新的題材的這一段落、我們可以稱之爲自發主義的時期、這種自發主義、很快地便被醒覺的目的意識所取消、並爲電影力量底統一運動所代替、所以、我們稱一部名爲（波立苦斯加）（Ｐolikushka）的影片、爲第一部蘇聯底影片、是並中錯誤的、因爲這是第一個包涵、得有電影劇之本質底理解的作品、但、這郤仍然不能算是把革命底經騐從電影的演劇再現了、説明了、或是使它變形爲藝術而更神化了、最初把革命經騐在影劇中聯繋起來的、是蒲鐸夫金（Ｐudov）、｜其作品（母親）｜、愛森斯坦｜亞歷山大甫（ＥisentienＡlexanddrov）｜其作品（罷工）及（戰艦波特姆欽）｜、雷斯曼（Ｒaisman）｜其作品（在古西比利亞）及其他諸人等、在這一個時期之中、蘇聯影片、把影劇之美學的範圍擴大了、它也從瑞典的地方影劇、從德國影壇的（黄金時代）、從美國電影之種種俗調乃至葛雷斐司之平淡無奇的一套、均曾加以吸收、而就此朽腐、化爲神奇、誠如毛新勒（ＩeonＭoussinac）氏説、蘇聯｜影片之參加爲（革命）中的一部、是把本來的電影之廣度與深度都擴大並增高了、</p>
<p>就蘇聯電影所演之世界的角色而論、那種製作原則成爲使人感興味、而使一般電影導演從其滿足的經騐中亦不免時時令其迷惑的事、並不是可驚的、這種原則、便是稱之爲Ｍontage的、實將成爲一種其自身在不斷　革中的世界電影文化底要素、這不僅是對於蘇聯影片而言、也是對於全部的電影劇而言、在實際上、這是把本來具有無上力量的電影底力量更其使之强化了、今日的蘇聯電影機關是認爲運用這些工具不難到達那種人類經騐之最終點的接觸的、然而這並不是説對於過去的原始時期是没有一種依存的關係、（未完）</p>

<h3>An Urgent Plan to Rescue Rice Prices by Huan Cheng</h3>
<p>Low grain prices hurt farmers, and a good harvest becomes a disaster. Therefore, the call to rescue rice prices is urgent, and cries resonate throughout society. Although China's grain statistics are not precise, it seems unlikely that there will be overproduction based on a general overview. Jiangsu province, a rice-producing area, reports through the Jiangsu Construction Department that even in years of average harvest, it is insufficient to feed the population. As a result, the southern provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou all lack rice and rely on foreign rice for assistance each year. The northern provinces that produce wheat, such as Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Zhili, only have average harvests. Each province also plants peanuts and cotton, not exclusively wheat. Furthermore, Shanxi and Shaanxi have reported droughts and shortages. Only the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, including Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui, have abundant rice production. If domestic coordination is proper and circulation is smooth, there should be no fear of a drastic drop in grain prices.</p>
<p>However, the prices of rice and wheat have plummeted everywhere due to many reasons, but the main ones are nothing more than the lack of domestic circulation and the oppression from abroad.</p>
<p>An example of the lack of domestic circulation is that in previous years, provinces like Guangdong and Fujian procured rice from Wuhu. In recent years, due to excessive rice taxes imposed by Anhui warlords and bandits obstructing transportation, the Wuhu rice market has suddenly declined. The southern provinces have had to purchase rice from Saigon and Yangon. If we want to restore domestic circulation, we must first abolish rice taxes and protect transportation. Only then can we have hope.</p>
<p>What about the oppression from abroad? Worldwide wheat production statistics certainly show oversupply, and the United States has an abundance of wheat in storage. According to recent reports, global wheat production is 1.2 billion tons, but sales are only 700 million tons. Therefore, the United States, Canada, and Australia are all competing to sell at low prices to China, which is better than feeding livestock or burning and discarding it. Thus, grain imports are an important reason for oppressing our agricultural products.</p>
<p>However, the government is still considering a loan of American wheat. Whether it will succeed is unknown, but it is undoubtedly similar to taking poison to quench thirst.</p>
<p>Some propose imposing taxes on imported foreign rice, but they hesitate to set a standard price, saying that taxes should only be levied when the price falls below the standard and stopped when the price rises above the standard. It is not known that China's tariffs have already been largely granted autonomy, so taxes can be levied or stopped at will. There is no need to be adamant about a standard. Once taxes are added, those who purchase foreign rice in Guangdong and Fujian will inevitably turn to the interior to purchase rice, and rice prices will not be difficult to see rising quickly.</p>
<p>It is not only rice that should be taxed. Wheat and flour should also be taxed to curb dumping. Furthermore, the tax rate should not be too low. Foreign rice must be above two yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) in national currency, wheat must be one and a half yuan per shi, and flour must be above one yuan per bag to have the power to protect domestic agricultural products.</p>
<p>Once taxes are added, grain imports will inevitably decrease sharply. The purpose of adding taxes is to protect agricultural products, not to increase tax revenue. Therefore, the grain tax revenue should be stored separately for the purpose of restoring the rural economy.</p>
<p>If the proposal for a loan of American wheat has not been finalized, it should be canceled immediately. If it has been finalized, taxes should be added to the borrowed wheat, and it should be stored entirely for military use, not dumped on the market as a remedy. If the government still cares about the livelihoods of farmers and protects the unlimited source of tax revenue in the future, it should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Abolish inland taxes to restore domestic circulation, and add import taxes to curb foreign oppression. The methods to rescue rice prices are not limited to these, but these are the most urgent and important methods, so I will discuss them first.</p>

On the 3rd, 3,000 salt industry employees and students gathered and marched, petitioning military police and salt affairs agencies to maintain the people's livelihood and abolish the public business office. The turmoil has expanded. (Special dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>After Heated Debate in the Upper House, British Government Announces its Attitude on Sino-Japanese Case</h3>
<p>Britain in the League of Nations Does Not Want to Act as a Leader, Willing to Unite with Other Countries to Find a Common Policy, Leader of the Labor Party Begins Questioning</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd, Opposition Leader Lord Parmoor asked the British government today about its attitude towards the conclusions of the Lytton Report. Parmoor began the debate on the Manchurian issue in solemn terms, praising the Lytton Commission's report, acknowledging the difficult circumstances encountered during the investigation, and stating that it was clear that the Manchurian issue could not be resolved simply by restoring the status quo. When Geneva considers this matter, Britain must provide guidance in the resolution of this difficult problem, which is extremely important.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Disregards World Opinion</p>
<p>The actions of the League of Nations are not always as rapid as some people expect, but have achieved a victory, albeit not special, but very large, in stopping the war in the Far East and bringing the two parties together in one room for deliberation. Japanese affairs are constantly changing, and he has reason to believe that the world does not warmly support the outbreak of Japanese military sentiment. He deeply knows that the major powers can jointly resolve the Manchurian problem.</p>
<p>Should Advance Further or Retreat</p>
<p>Lord Lothian of the Liberal Party said that the biggest question in the Manchurian dispute is whether we should move forward further in its resolution to establish an international system or retreat one step to a war that cannot be avoided. The Nine-Power Treaty of Washington, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Stimson Doctrine, if properly and resolutely applied, are all very powerful tools to deal with this difficult problem. Now the atmosphere of war in Japan is rising daily, and even Japan's best friends see Japan's terrible difficulties as possibly changing its steady policy of becoming a first-class power.</p>
<p>Chinese National Spirit is Flourishing</p>
<p>At the same time, the spirit of Chinese resistance is also flourishing. Chinese youth may deviate from the development of the constitution and move towards preparations for revenge. If the root of the Manchurian disaster is not removed, he predicts that the Washington Treaty will eventually be torn up and maritime disarmament will eventually be abandoned. What will happen to so-called disarmament and the anti-war pact at that time? And what will happen to the part of the British Empire in the Pacific? He hopes that the government understands the seriousness of this issue. The current situation requires wisdom, not inciting Far Eastern public opinion to act without consideration, but firmly advocating the possibility of resolving existing treaties.</p>
<p>Should Plan Early to Prevent a Small Spark from Starting a Prairie Fire</p>
<p>Lord Allen of the Labor Party said that the small spark in 1914 spread throughout the world, but the small spark in 1931 did not cause the same disaster. This is a very hopeful thing. He asked the government to announce that Britain will never be pleased with any agreement that does not make countries respect international obligations.</p>
<p>Hoping to Respect the Spirit of the League of Nations</p>
<p>Lord Cecil also asked the government to announce Britain's determination to support the League of Nations as soon as possible and to declare that if the Lytton Report is approved by the League of Nations Administrative Council, Britain will support the report.</p>
<p>Lord Lytton Expresses his Opinion</p>
<p>Achieving Success is Possible by Eliminating Dissent</p>
<p>Lord Lytton also attended the Upper House and rose to speak. First, he thanked those who supported his report, and then said that Geneva would discuss the report within half a month. There is currently no need to urge an early consideration. He does not expect the government to issue a concrete statement immediately. The League of Nations cannot act without the unanimous consent of all. If countries have preconceptions, unanimous agreement can never be obtained, but if the situation is allowed to delay any longer, the danger is very great. He acknowledged the faithful assistance of the Chinese and Japanese governments to the investigation team. The proposals of the investigation team are intended to be suggestions rather than unchangeable. The investigation team once wanted to make a more detailed report, but it was not done in the end because it wanted to focus its attention on more important principles. He agreed with Lord Lothian's remarks about the seriousness of the problem and the wisdom that should be used to deal with the situation. He believes that the greatest hope for success is to give the League of Nations a free hand. He believes that Foreign Secretary Simon can accept this report and use it as his focus in Geneva to allow his tentative proposals to become a very important achievement. Britain in the League of Nations Avoids Acting as a Leader and Does Not Want to Take Unilateral Action</p>
<p>Lord Hailsham, Secretary of War, spoke on behalf of the government, saying that he traveled to Tokyo several years ago to attend the Pacific Friendship Conference, and he knew the difficulty of the situation. Now the Lytton Report is commendable for making a fair statement on both sides in clear and constructive language. The report handles a difficult task, seeking to establish a harmonious relationship between the two countries within the structure of the League of Nations. Britain has always hoped to be friendly with these two countries. The League of Nations Administrative Council has now scheduled a discussion, so there is no need to urge an early consideration. Foreign Secretary Simon will certainly have the opportunity to discuss this report before setting off for Geneva and to discuss with the Cabinet a hypothetical plan for the best course of action that the Administrative Council can take, but Britain's purpose in Geneva is not to draw attention to its guidance or initiative, but to unite with other countries to seek a consistent policy. The purpose of the British representative is to urge the Chinese and Japanese governments to agree to the policies of the powers. He deeply knows the seriousness and far-reaching nature of the issues involved. Before the Administrative Council considers this report, the British government is not in a position to explain its behavior regarding the entire report or some of its proposals. He can tell Lord Parmoor that the reason why he cannot make any announcement on this issue is because the issue is too important and must be handled at the appropriate time and place and not be bound by prior remarks. Lord Parmoor made closing remarks to this debate, saying that he was very comforted by Lord Lytton's recent statement that Foreign Secretary Simon's focus should be the report itself. The debate ended here.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Sets Meeting for the 21st</h3>
<p>Special Committee and General Assembly to Be Postponed to Next Spring</p>
<p>Geneva, 2nd (Havas) – The League of Nations Administrative Council has decided to hold a meeting on November 21st to review the Lytton Report. A Japanese semi-official news agency in Geneva announced today that the Japanese government welcomes the League of Nations Administrative Council's decision to postpone the meeting by one week. This is because the Japanese government's written opinion on the Lytton Report is being brought to Europe by Ambassador Yoshida, who is not expected to arrive in Geneva before November 16th. Furthermore, the written opinion previously brought by Representative Matsuoka needs revisions. The postponement of the Administrative Council meeting will allow Japan to undertake these revisions. It is also expected that the Committee of Nineteen, organized by the League of Nations specifically for the Sino-Japanese dispute, will convene after the Administrative Council meeting adjourns. It is unlikely that this committee meeting will take place before December. If this is the case, how will the League of Nations Extraordinary General Assembly proceed? Considering that December is approaching the end of the year, the convocation of the Extraordinary General Assembly may be uncertain. From this perspective, although it cannot be immediately said that the Lytton Report will be delayed until January or February of next year for discussion by the League of Nations Special General Assembly, it is not impossible given the circumstances.</p>
<p>Japanese Representatives Using Tactics to Secure a Compromise in the Administrative Council and Avoid Discussion of the Manchurian Issue in the General Assembly</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Hualianshe) – The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed the Japanese representative in Geneva to use all efforts before the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting to win over representatives from smaller countries, as well as France, Italy, and England, to discuss a compromise solution to the Manchurian issue. Concessions should be made within the possible range. In any case, a decision should be made in the Administrative Council to strenuously avoid discussion of the Manchurian issue in the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Supplement to Japanese Written Opinion</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Dentsu) – The postponement of the League of Nations Council meeting by one week to the 21st, giving representatives from various countries the opportunity to thoroughly read the Japanese written opinion, is advantageous to Japan. However, several points in the main text of the written opinion carried by Ambassador Yoshida require supplementation and revision. An urgent telegram was sent to Ambassador Yoshida, who is en route to Geneva, instructing him on the points that need to be supplemented and revised. These include facts that have occurred since Ambassador Yoshida's departure on October 28th, such as the continuous internal strife in China, the further expansion of the state of political collapse, and the significant progress in the development of Manchuria. These two points should be further clarified to completely counter the Xiang Army's opposition to the report.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Hualianshe) – After the publication of the League of Nations investigation report, the Japanese military was greatly angered. They criticized the Lytton Report for not acknowledging that the Japanese military's actions were in self-defense and for asserting that the puppet organization was not at the request of the Chinese people. All actions of the Japanese military were declared bankrupt. Therefore, the Japanese military is urging the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to oppose the report while also ordering Xiang Armies across the country to hold large-scale meetings to oppose the League of Nations. Meetings have already been held twice in Kobe and Kyushu Fuzhou, and today a national convention is being held in Tokyo. Only 20,000 Xiang Army members out of 4 million attended. The following two resolutions were passed: (1) Oppose the League of Nations investigation report, which insults Japan; (2) Vigorously support the independence of (Manchukuo).</p>
<p>Ding Nishi-gen Arrives in Warsaw</p>
<p>Warsaw, 3rd (Reuters) – Ding Nishi-gen, the representative of the (Manchukuo) government, along with a personal representative of Puyi, who were en route to Geneva, have arrived here from Moscow.</p>
<p>Matsuoka Yosuke Seeks Russian Assistance</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Hualianshe) – According to Japanese sources, Matsuoka Yosuke arrived in Moscow this morning and is scheduled to meet with Karakhan and Litvinov this afternoon to persuade Russia to recognize the puppet organization and to discuss a non-aggression treaty and disarmament issues between Japan and Russia. It is said that the success of a compromise between Japan and Russia depends on this negotiation.</p>
<p>Seiyukai Opposes Russo-Japanese Treaty</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Hualianshe) – After the publication of the Lytton Report, there were widespread rumors in Japan about the desire to sign a treaty with Russia. This claim is merely a means to restrain the League of Nations and lacks concrete preparation. The Kokumin Domei faction of Adachi Kenzo expressed strong support, so the Seiyukai issued a statement opposing it. They argued that international disputes have always been resolved through treaties or war, but in the future, there will be ideological warfare in addition to military warfare. The national system and ideological stance of Soviet Russia and Japan are completely opposite, and there is no possibility of friendship. Japan should not seek temporary convenience at the expense of long-term harm.</p>

<h3>Herriot Leaves the Western Capital Under Strict Police Protection</h3>
<p>Besides Obtaining Spain's Support for the French Plan, There Were No Other Achievements on This Trip, and His Disappointment Was Evident in His Words</p>
<p>Madrid, 2nd (Kokuminsha) – French Prime Minister Herriot stayed here for approximately 48 hours and left Spain today under strict police protection to return to France. Spanish Prime Minister Azaña and the majority of the cabinet members saw Mr. Herriot off at the station. However, according to news disclosed by French newspapers, Mr. Herriot's disappointment at the time of his departure from the Western Capital was mixed with joy. This is because, besides obtaining empty promises from the host to assist France in promoting European peace, Mr. Herriot can be said to have gained nothing else. Furthermore, the military agreement between France and Spain is practically out of the question here, so Mr. Herriot's wishes are difficult to fulfill. However, Mr. Herriot and all the figures in the current Republican government have been old friends for many years, as they often interacted when they were in exile in Paris. It is unknown whether Mr. Herriot raised the issue for discussion during this visit. Mr. Herriot's dissatisfaction with this trip can be seen in his interview with Spanish journalists. During the interview, Mr. Herriot expressed his indignation at the Spanish public's distrust of France, attributing it to the malicious propaganda of newspapers. When a reporter asked Mr. Herriot whether France had any intention of modifying the Treaty of Versailles, Mr. Herriot became quite angry and said that France had done its best to modify the treaty, adding, "What else do they want? Do they want our shirts? If so, let them come and take them, but we are not willing to give them away!" His tone and expression were fierce.</p>
<p>Madrid, 3rd (Kokuminsha) – It has been learned that French Prime Minister Herriot has obtained Spain's unconditional support for France's new plan for security and disarmament. Today, the Spanish Foreign Minister stated to the press that the government will instruct its representatives attending the Disarmament Conference to support the French plan, adding that his views are completely consistent with those of the French Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Paris, 2nd (Kokuminsha) – It is widely rumored here tonight that there was an assassination attempt on Herriot before he left Madrid. Political circles have denied this claim. Mr. Herriot is heading directly from Madrid to Toulouse, where he will participate in the opening ceremony of the Radical Party's annual meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Rome, 2nd (Kokuminsha) – Although the newspapers here have published many reports about French Prime Minister Herriot's visit to Madrid, they do not comment on them or speculate on the purpose of this trip. However, they all unanimously believe that it has political significance.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Conference Executives Meeting</h3>
<p>Henderson Presents Reports from Various Specialized Committees</p>
<p>French Representative Explains New Disarmament Plan</p>
<p>Geneva, 3rd (Havas) – The Presidium of the Disarmament Conference held its first meeting at 3:30 PM today. Chairman Henderson explained the current situation and presented reports from various specialized committees. Tomorrow, French Representative Paul-Boncour will give an oral explanation of the French plan for disarmament and security, which is eagerly awaited by the public. After this explanation, Paul-Boncour will submit a memorandum on this plan to the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference so that French Prime Minister Herriot's speech to the French Chamber of Deputies and Paul-Boncour's oral explanation to the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference can be further substantiated. This plan is expected to be widely discussed by the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference between the 21st and 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Public Gatherings During German Parliamentary Re-election Period</h3>
<p>General Strike of Transportation Workers in Berlin</p>
<p>Conflicts Between Kuomintang and Communist Parties Occur Frequently in Various Regions</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Reuters) – All public meetings, whether indoors or in the streets, are prohibited in Germany during the election period from November 6th to the 19th. President Hindenburg has issued this order, stating that the purpose of this measure is to calm political emotions and allow the police to have some rest.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Reuters) – The German Parliament previously passed a proposal by the Social Democratic Party to abolish all temporary emergency decrees by a majority vote. Dissatisfied with the Papen government, it was dissolved on September 12th, and elections are scheduled to be held on November 6th. As the voting date approaches, the national atmosphere is becoming increasingly active. Slogans of the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party can be seen everywhere, and party flags are gradually appearing, especially red flags in workers' residences. Berlin still feels peaceful, but disturbances have occurred in other places. Yesterday, there was a shooting incident between the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party in Hamburg. The police searched the Communist Party's offices and arrested many people. In the Bavarian town of Bad Reichenhall, a bomb exploded in the mayor's garden, killing a servant. It is believed that this was done by unemployed people.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Tariff Modifications</h3>
<p>Ottawa Agreement to Be Implemented</p>
<p>Labor Party Amendment Rejected</p>
<p>Wellington, 2nd (Reuters) – The Ottawa Agreement Act was passed on October 13th. To implement the act, a tariff bill was introduced in the House of Representatives tonight. The bill includes clauses authorizing the government to negotiate with other parts of the Empire on future tariff adjustments and surcharges, and to protect the interests of New Zealand tobacco producers from harm caused by the abolition of import surcharges. According to the Ottawa Agreement, New Zealand undertakes to Britain not to increase unloading fees, lower existing taxes, abolish surcharges on British goods, and modify certain basic import taxes. London, 2nd (Reuters) – Today, the House of Commons rejected the amendment proposed by the Labor Party by a vote of 268 to 57. The Labor Party argued for the inclusion of a clause in the Ottawa Agreement Act stating that the act should not prevent the government from reducing the ad valorem tax of one-tenth stipulated in the Import Duties Act of 1932. Liberal Party member Beveridge stated that the act did not prevent the government from reducing taxes according to law, nor did it stipulate a five-year validity period for the Ottawa Agreement. Parliament is always in the highest position, and a parliamentary act today can be repealed by Parliament in the future. Therefore, the amendment proposed by the Labor Party is not necessary.</p>
<h3>Berlin Traffic Paralyzed</h3>
<p>General Strike of Transportation Workers Begins</p>
<p>Major Clash Between Extremist Factions in Hamburg</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Havas) – Workers in Berlin's public transportation system began a general strike this morning. Although the Social Democratic trade union expressed opposition, it was to no avail. Supporters of the strike did not account for the majority in the meetings of workers and employees, but the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party had already organized it. Therefore, trams, buses, and the underground railway have completely stopped.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Kokuminsha) – This morning, workers of the Berlin underground railway, trams, and buses suddenly went on strike. Only the state-run city railway is operating as usual, becoming the only means of transportation in the city. It is said that this strike was decided last night due to the company's plan to reduce wages.</p>
<p>Hamburg, 2nd (Kokuminsha) – After a period of calm, the activities of extremist factions here show signs of resurgence. Today, a violent clash occurred between the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party, injuring dozens of people, with several people in critical condition. The reason is that many Communist Party members saw National Socialist Party members distributing leaflets and opened fire on them, resulting in a conflict between the two sides. The police quickly took a large-scale encirclement approach to search. All Communist Party meeting places were inspected, and more than 200 Communists were arrested.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of Polish Foreign Minister's Resignation</h3>
<p>Warsaw, 3rd (Kokuminsha) – The resignation of Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski, who is only 49 years old, due to illness is clearly due to disagreement with Piłsudski. This can be seen in his claim that he will completely withdraw from politics and return to his old career in science. As for the truth of the dispute, it is still kept secret. It is widely believed that recent diplomatic developments, such as Romania's unilateral ratification of the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, are of great importance.</p>
<p>Warsaw, 2nd (Havas) – After the resignation of Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski, Undersecretary Colonel Beck was appointed. Born in 1894, Beck greatly assisted Poland in organizing its army after the European War. Beck is also a confidant of General Piłsudski and an important figure in the (officer) party. Former Foreign Minister Zaleski constantly attended various international conferences, so he spent most of his time in Geneva. Therefore, Beck often acted as Undersecretary on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. For example, when Poland and the Soviet Union negotiated the Treaty of Non-Aggression, Beck was responsible for deciding on several important issues.</p>
<h3>British Unemployed Workers' Petition to Parliament Confiscated by Police</h3>
<p>Demonstration Movement Seems to Be Coming to an End</p>
<p>London, 2nd (Havas) – Police authorities have confiscated a petition signed by one million (hunger marchers). This petition was originally intended to be submitted to Parliament. Last night, it was handed over to a delegation of (hunger marchers). When the delegation was about to go to Parliament, the police prohibited them from approaching Parliament for fear of arrest. The petition was deposited in the Charing Cross Street Station. Today, when the delegation went to the station with the receipt to retrieve it, they learned that it had been confiscated by the police. This shows that the police are taking strict precautions against the actions of the delegation. The demonstration movement of the (hunger marchers) seems to be coming to an end. Some demonstrators have been arrested for minor crimes and have been sentenced to imprisonment or fines. The rest will be deported by the government. Furthermore, this movement seems unlikely to be mentioned again in Parliament. Although unemployed workers have repeatedly expressed their opposition to the government's system of (assessing living ability before granting subsidies), it has been largely ineffective.</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Palace Commemorates Meiji Day</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Jiji) – Today is the memorial day of Emperor Meiji. A ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace. At noon, a banquet was held in the Toyoake-den. Marshals Togo and Yamamoto, Prime Minister Saito, cabinet members, privy councilors, generals of the army and navy, speakers of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, and ambassadors and ministers from various countries, totaling 700 people, attended. The Emperor, wearing an army uniform, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. Prime Minister Saito delivered a response on behalf of the ministers, and the Belgian ambassador delivered a response on behalf of the foreign envoys. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>League of Nations Special Meeting and Japanese-American War</h3>
<p>(Written by Japanese Navy Major Ishimaru Tota, Translated by this Newspaper)</p>
<p>Many Opportunities to Incite War, Japan Should Be Prepared</p>
<p>Preface: If the worst were to happen at this League of Nations special meeting, could it lead to war? This question is of great interest and can be called the conclusion of Japan's war against the League of Nations. I firmly believe that this is very unlikely. Moreover, I believe that if war does break out, it will not be a direct result of Japan's war against the League, but rather the result of the United States taking advantage of the dangerous atmosphere stirred up by Japan and repeatedly trying its second and third stages of anti-Japanese suppression tactics, ultimately leading to war. The following will explain this in order.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' Sanctions Are Weak: In my opinion, the League of Nations' sanctions are inevitably powerless and do not seem to be able to cause war in the current state.</p>
<p>The League of Nations Covenant's sanctions are divided into three types: (1) Expulsion; (2) Economic sanctions; (3) Military sanctions. Among them, expulsion is the lightest and will definitely not lead to war.</p>
<p>As for economic sanctions, they must have military force as a backup. In other words, the effect of economic sanctions cannot be achieved without the determination and preparation to accept even war. Therefore, actively advocating economic sanctions will ultimately lead to war. Economic sanctions without war as a premise will have little effect even if implemented. This is the final conclusion regarding economic sanctions.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the League of Nations wants to impose truly effective economic sanctions on Japan, at least Britain and the United States must jointly have the determination and preparation to accept war. Otherwise, there is no hope of success. As for the other member states of the League, it goes without saying that they must cooperate in economic sanctions. However, if the core Britain and the United States remain indecisive, Japan will feel that there is nothing to worry about. So, what is the attitude of Britain and the United States now? Britain has absolutely no momentum for war, and American public opinion does not want war. Even if naval theorists reluctantly advocate for war, they cannot engage in war alone today due to insufficient naval power. Therefore, peace can be temporarily maintained for the next few years.</p>
<p>If the third type of military sanctions can actually be implemented, it would certainly be most effective, but its implementation is extremely difficult and there is little hope of realization in the League of Nations Covenant. Even according to the League of Nations Covenant, military sanctions are not defined as a mandatory obligation of the member states and there is no clear statement that they must be followed. However, there are indirect provisions stating that they can be implemented and that there will be a time when they can be implemented. This can be seen in Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the Covenant. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>(In the event that any Member of the League resorts to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to all the provisions of Article 16 of this Covenant.)</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the implementation of military sanctions is provided for in the Covenant, but the so-called proposal of the Council is purely advisory and there is no absolute obligation to follow it. Therefore, the member states receiving the proposal are not obligated to comply with it. Furthermore, there is no clear stipulation as to what circumstances warrant the imposition of military sanctions. In other words, the member states of the League are not obligated to participate in military sanctions, and the so-called military sanctions only say that they can be imposed and that there will be a time when they can be implemented. This is a very moderate provision.</p>
<p>Because the provisions are moderate, these military sanctions cannot be implemented without the core Britain and the United States having a clear view. Therefore, in this regard, there is no possibility of causing war.</p>
<p>Hoover-style Sanctions Are Insufficient: Perhaps American President Hoover saw that the sanctions stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant were incomplete and lacked strength, and that the Kellogg-Briand Pact had no provisions for sanctions and its power was even weaker. Therefore, he came up with the so-called Hoover-style sanctions and proposed it to the League of Nations, which was endorsed by the majority of the League. If the worst were to happen in Japan's war against the League of Nations, this type of sanction could be adopted.</p>
<p>This type of sanction is considered to be the best method of preventing the use of force in international relations because its main aim is to make all results obtained by those who disregard peace treaties and resort to war have no value. This has been clearly stipulated and is recorded in the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on March 11 of this year.</p>
<p>(The Members of the League undertake that they will not recognize any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the Covenant of the League of Nations or to the Pact of Paris.)</p>
<p>In other words, since Japan's actions in Manchuria violate the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, from not recognizing the realization of Manchukuo, all Japan-Manchukuo protocols and future treaties and agreements between Japan and Manchukuo, as well as treaties and agreements between Manchukuo and countries other than Japan, will not be recognized.</p>
<p>If the American authorities were to explain this type of sanction, they would say that it is intended to avoid military sanctions and economic sanctions, so it is changed to moral sanctions that appeal to world opinion. The reason for avoiding military sanctions is that since the Kellogg-Briand Pact has been signed, it would be unreasonable to use military force for sanctions. So why not use economic sanctions? It is said that openly ordering economic severance by the government would ultimately lead to war, and the effect of economic severance by only one country is minimal and must be implemented by all countries together. If you want all countries to implement it together, the difficult question of deciding who is the aggressor arises again. But it is still extremely difficult for all countries to implement it together. Furthermore, the negative impact of economic severance is shifted to non-combatants, and combatants are not greatly affected. All of these points are reasons for not adopting economic sanctions. So what is the effect of Hoover-style sanctions? Secretary Stimson gave a speech titled "Japan Can Be Called an Aggressor" to describe the merits of this type of sanction.</p>
<p>(The declaration of not recognizing the results of aggression may be regarded by the aggressor as insignificant, but it cannot be determined. Since the US government first advocated it and has rallied all the civilized countries of the world to advocate non-recognition, it is actually a major event that has never been seen in the international community. How can the world's public opinion be organized in this way and a total mobilization order be issued is rare since ancient times.)</p>
<p>But can Stimson's words make Japan yield? I know that it will not. Why? Because the will of our Japanese people is firm and will never be shaken by empty words. The American Brailsford once said, "While Americans bury their heads in the sand, the Japanese still take what they can take." For this reason, the Economic Sanctions Committee, whose chairman is Dr. Butler, the president of Columbia University, and whose directors include Dr. Gulick, have proposed a plan with the following main points:</p>
<p>(1) Countries should exert moral pressure on those who violate the treaty.</p>
<p>(2) If there are still countries that continue to violate the treaty, then other ways to deal with them should be considered, namely (a) hindering their military operations and (b) endangering their domestic industry and commerce, but countries should take consistent action.</p>
<p>However, hindering the military operations of countries that violate the treaty ultimately borders on acts of war, and endangering domestic industry and commerce is almost the same as economic severance. Thinking about it this way, Hoover-style sanctions still contain the possibility of economic severance that they want to avoid, and the war outcome they want to prevent will ultimately be difficult to avoid. Therefore, what should be noted is that if countries can cooperate and continue to implement Hoover-style sanctions, Japan's domestic debt will increase, its external credit will be lost, its reserves will lose most of their value, the yen exchange rate will plummet, and the government will be in a difficult situation to maintain. This is the most obvious damage that Japan suffers in terms of commerce, economy, and finance. However, in order to achieve this result, it is necessary for countries to be patient and willing to make sacrifices. This is easy to say but difficult to do. Unless Britain and the United States first have the preparation for a decisive battle, thinking that the assistance of various countries will not succeed, then Japan will ultimately feel that Hoover-style sanctions are not to be feared because they resemble empty words.

<h3>Current Situation and Trends of the Sichuan War</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang's Troops Occupy Rongchang and Longchang</p>
<p>The 24th Army Has Retreated to the Third Line of Defense</p>
<p>Liu, Tian, Deng, and Yang Are Implementing Armed Mediation</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Since the general offensive by Liu Xiang's army in the Sichuan war, Liu Wenhui's 24th Army has been retreating steadily. Its first line of defense, Jiangjin, Yongchuan, Hechuan, and Dazu, has been successively occupied by Liu Xiang's army. In recent days, fierce battles have taken place in Rongchang and Longchang, with heavy losses on both sides. According to Chongqing's propaganda, Rongchang has been captured by their army. At the same time, Anyue was occupied by Yang Sen, Li Jiayu, Zaze Zhou, and other units. On the 2nd, Liu Xiang's office in Hankou received a telegram from Li Hongkun, the chief of staff of the army, reporting on the war situation. The gist of the telegram is as follows: (1) According to a telegram from Division Commander Tang Zijing, the three brigades of Yu, Li, and Tian, which were originally expected to hold firmly in Dazu, were attacked by our army in multiple directions, with Zhou's brigade flanking the enemy's rear. The enemy was unable to resist and retreated towards Wujiapu, and Dazu was occupied. In this battle, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, with more than 1,000 guns captured and hundreds surrendering. (2) According to a telegram from Division Commander Pan Zhongsan, the enemy in Rongchang fought with us for about four hours and retreated towards Longchang. Our Guo brigade occupied Rongchang on the evening of the 31st, with numerous captives and spoils. (3) The Yang brigade, the enemy in Hejiang, was attacked by our army's Bayu and Yangtze River warships, as well as Liao's and Mu's brigades towards the south bank detachment. The enemy abandoned the city and fled. We immediately occupied Hejiang. (4) According to telegrams from Yang, Li, Luo, and other units in the north, these armies launched a joint attack on Anyue from Suining in multiple directions and occupied Anyue at 3:00 pm. (5) According to a telegram from Division Commander Pan Zhongsan and Guo and Fan brigades, the enemy in Longchang was fiercely attacked by our army and retreated to Neijiang, Guanyintan, and Niufudu. We have already stationed troops in Longchang. The enemy has been defeated repeatedly, and the morale of the army has been disintegrating. After a brief but fierce battle, the enemy quickly collapsed. We captured Jiangjin a few days ago, and the enemy Xu Yanxiu brigade collapsed completely and disintegrated. Judging from the current enemy situation, it seems that they will retreat to the south bank of the Tuojiang River, but their momentum has been thwarted, and even the wise cannot remedy the situation. However, according to Liu Wenhui's propaganda, the areas were voluntarily abandoned to avoid the scourge of war. However, the victory of the Chongqing army seems to be confirmed. When Rongchang and Longchang were fiercely fought, Liu Xiang once went to Yongchuan to supervise the battle. It is now heard that he has returned to Chongqing and will go to Suining to meet with Yang, Luo, Li, and others. Liu Wenhui is in Luzhou, taking Luzhou, Xufu, Zizhong, and Neijiang as the final line of defense, deploying fortifications, and preparing for the final battle. If Liu Xiang continues to advance south, he will launch a full-scale counterattack. Luzhou is located at the intersection of the Yangtze and Tuo rivers, the gateway to Yunnan and Guizhou, surrounded by mountains and rivers, and is the most important town in southern Sichuan. Hence, there is a saying: "Naturally occurring Chongqing, iron-cast Luzhou." Xufu, Zizhong, and Neijiang are also places where heavy troops are stationed. Therefore, although Liu Xiang's army is said to have won repeatedly, it may not dare to venture deep and make a desperate gamble.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Liu Wenhui is shortening the battle lines, relying on dangerous terrain for defense, and on the other hand, he is publicizing that he does not want internal strife. He has also repeatedly telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek about Liu Xiang's attack, requesting him to take measures to stop it. Chiang recently replied from Hankou: "I have received all the telegrams and have telegraphed Fu Cheng to try to stop it. Your respect for the central government and efforts to end the war are commendable. I still hope that you will strictly instruct all departments to avoid conflicts." It is heard that Chiang is paying close attention to the Sichuan affairs. When he went to Hunan, he summoned Xu Zhongqi, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, to inquire about the truth of the Sichuan situation, and instructed him to prepare opinions for review and adoption after returning to Hankou. At the same time, Zhang Qun and others are also studying solutions. Zhang has departed from Nanjing and is coming to Hankou to meet with Chiang. As for other generals in Sichuan, Liu Cunhou, the Border Defense Commissioner of Sichuan and Shaanxi, Yang Sen, the commander of the 20th Army, Deng Xihou, the commander of the 28th Army, and Tian Songyao, the commander of the 29th Army, were previously ordered by the central government to mediate, but to no effect. Liu and others then implemented the so-called armed mediation. Liu Bangjun, the commander of Liu's army, led two divisions to station in Peng'an. More than 10,000 troops of Yang's army advanced to Wusheng and Suining. Deng's Huang Yinquan division stationed in Jianyang and Lezhi. Tian's troops also stationed in Jianyang. The first step was to convene a meeting in Suining. Liu Bangjun and Yang Sen have arrived first to prepare. Liu Xiang, Liu Cunhou, Deng Xihou, and Tian Songyao will all attend in person. If mediation fails, neutral generals will intervene with heavy troops. The generals hold resentment towards Liu Wenhui for his ability to incite the troops and want to suppress him. They also hate Liu Xiang for his habit of withholding weapons and do not want to be driven by him. Therefore, they have no fundamental determination to eradicate Liu Wenhui, and they especially do not want Liu Xiang to achieve final victory. The best way for each general is to maintain mutual benefits. It is heard that the generals will propose conditions to force Liu Wenhui to cede one or two dozen counties as garrison areas for the armies and hand over political power, retaining the titles of the 24th Army and the Sichuan-Kang border defense forces. The position of chairman may be taken over by Tian Songyao. The Chongqing transportation issue will also be discussed with Liu Xiang. This plan has not yet been announced and is still under consideration. Liu Wenhui, knowing that he is isolated, has recently changed his course and expressed agreement with the principles of governance proposed by the second-tier generals, and is willing to unconditionally hand over the areas occupied by the coalition forces to ease the situation. Therefore, the atmosphere of peace has become浓厚 again in recent days, and perhaps the Sichuan situation will take a sharp turn for the better from now on. Overall, Liu Xiang, with the momentum of his victory, wants to swallow Zizhong and Neijiang. Liu Wenhui is determined to die and does not want to be humiliated by Liu Xiang. Each general has a desire to share the spoils and creates opportunities at any time. In the future, the result of the war will be that the two Lius will gain nothing, only increasing the territory and expanding the power of Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, Deng Xihou, and Tian Songyao.</p>
<p>According to Xu Zhongqi, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, who came to Hankou, the Sichuan war has both distant and immediate causes. The distant cause is the issue of the strength and wealth of the generals. Liu Wenhui has the largest territory and the most wealth, and is inevitably coveted by others, so they agreed to restrain him. The immediate cause is the issue of collecting national defense donations. Liu Wenhui has ambitions to unify the entire Sichuan and is wealthy and good at business, often buying off the subordinates of various armies. Once he raises a huge sum of 20 million, he will mobilize the troops in all directions to be under his command, which makes everyone feel threatened and triggers a major war. As for the various armies plundering the people's wealth, they are all-encompassing. Generally, the land tax has been collected until the 45th year of the Republic of China. Liu Wenhui's defense area collects taxes about five times a year, and Liu Xiang's defense area collects taxes about three times a year. Other generals are mostly the same. The people have been exploited to the point of being empty. Among them, Liu Wenhui is the most resistant to the central government, the most destructive to party affairs, and the most oppressive to the masses. County party committee members and special commissioners have been shot and killed. He is the most powerful of all the generals. Therefore, if the central government wants to transform Sichuan and save the people from misery, it must break the existing separatist situation, restrain the disastrous generals, and then support the people to organize militia groups so that they can defend themselves. Only then can Sichuan's politics be clear. Otherwise, it will be just empty talk and will not help the situation. (November 2nd)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Pays Tribute to the Four Martyrs Jiao, Chen, Huang, and Cai</h3>
<p>And Tours the Scenic Spots of Yuelu</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: October 31st is the anniversary of the death of the four martyrs Jiao, Chen, Huang, and Cai. The two martyrs Jiao and Chen launched the uprising in Changsha on October 22nd, immediately after the Wuchang Uprising on October 10th of the Xinhai year. A group of inferior gentry, very jealous of them, incited rioters on October 31st under the pretext of the Hefeng Paper Money run, and brutally killed them. Mr. Huang Xing (Huang Keciang) worked hard for the revolution and never gave up. He made great contributions to the Guangzhou and Wuchang battles. Unfortunately, he died of illness in Shanghai in the 5th year of the Republic of China. Mr. Cai Songpo launched the uprising in Yunnan during the campaign against Yuan Shikai. Within a few months, the provinces responded and overthrew the imperial system and rebuilt the republic. Unfortunately, he also died of illness. The tombs of the four gentlemen are all located in Mount Lu. Chairman Chiang, in order to admire the predecessors and inspire future generations, expanded the memorial week on this day. After finishing the training speech, he accompanied his wife, He Jian, Liu Jianxu, Li Jue, Tao Guang, Cao Bowen, Tan Changgai, and more than 200 others, from the Changsha Customs Wharf at 10:00 am, took a steam boat across the river to Yingwanshi, and took a sedan to Mount Lu. They stopped at the Five-Wheel Pagoda. Chiang, He, and others walked to Wanchou Temple for a short rest and then entered the auditorium to pay tribute. All the participants stood in two rows, front and back, solemnly. Led by Xiong Shiding, Luo Yue, and others, they first paid tribute to the spirits of the four martyrs Jiao, Chen, Huang, and Cai, offering fresh flowers and fruits. Then, they read the memorial text: "Chiang Chung-cheng, Chairman of the Military Affairs Committee of the Republic of China, and Song Meiling, member of the Legislative Yuan, led Wang Qi, Zhang Jiong, Zhu Haohuai, Xie Zuyou, Huang Jiasheng, Peng Guojun, Peng Yunbin, Xiao Fengwei, Meng Qingxuan, Liu Binshu, members of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, Zeng Jiwu, Ye Kaixin, Song Hegeng, Cao Dianqiu, Wu Jianxue, Cao Bowen, Zhang Kailian, Tan Changgai, Zhu Jingnong, Huang Shiheng, Chen Quzhen, Yu Jichuan, Secretary-General Yi Shuzhu, Liu Jianxu, Commander of the 28th Army, Wang Dongyuan, Commander of the 15th Division, Peng Weiren, Commander of the 16th Division, Li Jue, Commander of the 19th Division, Tao Guang, Commander of the 62nd Division, Chen Guangzhong, Commander of the 63rd Division, Xu Shengjin, President of the Hunan High Court, Hu Da, Commander of the Hunan Provincial Garrison, and others, respectfully present livestock and fruits to the spirits of the four gentlemen Jiao, Chen, Huang, and Cai. Alas! The establishment of democracy truly began in the Xinhai year. Following the first uprising in Hubei, the high banners and extraordinary colors changed suddenly. After the event, we mourn forever. Souls, return to Mount Lu in the night rain! Clear and bright is Shanhua, resolute and upright is Shaoyang. We hope to enlighten the nine heavens. The merits of restoring order are vast, rescuing the people from fire and water, and establishing the national foundation. Heaven did not spare them, how can we forget their legacy? The world is in turmoil, and wars have continued for years. The island barbarians are cunning and invading, and the danger is even more imminent. The people rely on you for protection, and the country is tied to you. Suppressing the bandits and eliminating the violence, the bright sun shines. The tombstone stands tall, and the bronze statue is majestic. The sacrificial rites are solemn, and the sincerity will resonate for ten thousand years." After the ceremony, lunch was served. At 1:00 pm, some of the participants crossed the river and returned to the city. However, Chiang stayed in the mountains to tour the scenic spots of Mount Lu and the tombs of Jiao, Chen, Huang, and Cai. He Jian, Liu Jianxu, Tan Changgai, and others accompanied him. First, they went to Zhang Shihou's tomb, then to the tombs of Cai Songpo, Huang Keciang, Liu Kuntao, and others. At each place, Chiang respectfully walked forward and gave the highest respect. He Jian and others also accompanied him to pay respects. Then, they toured the Yuelu Palace. Passing through Hunan University, the entire student body lined up to welcome Chiang and gave a speech in the auditorium for about half an hour. The main points were: (1) He hoped that all the students of the school would carry forward the revolutionary spirit of Hunan in the past to save China and improve the national status as a model for the whole country. (2) Young students should seek the truth of being human and saving the country with a neat and solemn spirit. (3) They must cultivate the eight virtues of filial piety, brotherhood, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. (4) As long as young students have genuine awareness, it will not be difficult to conquer the tyranny. The ancients said, "Even though Chu has only three households, Chu will surely destroy Qin." The people of Hunan must not belittle themselves. It was already 4:00 pm. Chiang, because Mount Lu is a famous mountain and a place where the ancients lectured, and the air is fresher than in the city, stayed at Zhang Gong's tomb for rest. He Jian, Zhu Jingnong, Cao Dianqiu, and others stayed at Wanfu Temple. This morning (1st), they crossed the river at 9:00 am to inspect the Fourth Route Army troops in the province at the Xiecao training ground. (November 1st)</p>

<p>Important News II</p>
<h3>Opening of the Seven Provinces Highway Conference</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Seven Provinces Highway Conference convened by the Third Route Army General Headquarters was held at 9:00 am on the 2nd in the auditorium of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. Participants included Cao Haosen, Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters; Zhu Shaoliang, Chief Advisor; Yang Yongtai, Secretary-General; Xu Baozhong, Director of the Transportation Department; Lin Xiang, Director of the Transportation Department; Luo Junqiang, Wang Zhaoquan, and Yu Zhiming, Secretaries; Zhang Jingyu, Director of the Henan Construction Department; Li Shucheng, Director of the Hubei Construction Department; Liu Yiyan, Director of the Anhui Construction Department; Gong Xuesui, Director of the Jiangxi Construction Department; Xu Xingcheng and Kong Xianwen, representatives of the Jiangsu Construction Department; Chen Ticheng, Director of the Zhejiang Highway Bureau; Zhou Fengjiu, representative of the Hunan Construction Department; Qin Fen, representative of the National Economic Committee; and Wang Lun, representative of the General Staff Headquarters, totaling more than 20 people. Zhu Shaoliang presided over the meeting and delivered the opening speech, stating that the construction of highways is very important. For example, between Shanghai and Nanjing, there are the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Shanghai-Hankou shipping routes, so it is considered that there is no need to worry about transportation. However, many people have not paid attention to the highway aspect. It should be understood that relying solely on rivers and railways is incomplete for national defense. If war breaks out, the railway will be cut off and the river will be blockaded, wouldn't national defense be unreliable? Therefore, in China, where our naval defense is incomplete, it is necessary to actively build highways. As for suppressing bandits, it is easier to win in places with convenient transportation because convenient transportation allows for the rapid dispatch of troops and the transportation of supplies, ammunition, and food. If we go to places with inconvenient transportation to suppress bandits, the deployment of troops will be delayed, and the supply of food and ammunition will be troublesome. Therefore, if we want to eliminate bandits and prevent internal disturbances, we must ensure that highway transportation is smooth. In the past, the construction of highways in various provinces was almost independent, and the engineering routes and funding arrangements were completely inconsistent. For national defense, the routes in various provinces must be connected and unified according to a plan to be successful. However, the finances of the central government and various provinces are very difficult, and it is not easy for the central government or a province to bear the costs alone. Therefore, we must repair several main lines so that the public knows the benefits of convenient transportation, and everyone will be willing to help. Half of it should be promoted by the government, and half should be enthusiastically supported by the people. Only then can it be successful. Therefore, the Commander-in-Chief specially convened the construction authorities and road construction professionals of these related provinces to discuss. The discussion should cover how to divide the highway routes, how to determine the width of the road surface, how to apply it to national defense transportation, and how to raise funds. These all require collective efforts to study a method. Furthermore, supervision is also indispensable. For example, the current plan is to unify the construction of connecting highways by the provinces, with each province responsible for completing a section. There should be a supervisory agency to guide and inspect the engineering facilities and the maintenance of the roads after completion to avoid disagreements. In addition to the need for people's assistance, the route also needs the assistance of the army. The construction of several sections of highways in Jiangxi last year was also assisted by the army. The purpose of the General Headquarters convening this meeting is to enable the army to assist in road construction in the future. With the assistance of the army, the speed of work can be increased. Therefore, it is necessary to set up this supervisory agency, which will also be discussed and decided at the meeting in the future. The above points are very important. It is hoped that the meeting will be short, the resolutions will be many, and everything will be implemented. Then, Cao Haosen delivered a speech on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief, stating that he was speaking a few words on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief at the opening ceremony of the highway conference today. He had been in Jiangxi for five months last year and in Hubei for five months this year. He deeply knew that the major reason for the rampant bandits was the poor roads and inconvenient transportation. They took advantage of our shortcomings. They knew that the deployment of troops was not smooth due to inconvenient transportation, so they dared to act recklessly and without restraint. Therefore, if we do not quickly develop highways, there is a real danger of being out of control once a bandit disaster occurs. Furthermore, the economic foundation of China's rural areas can be said to have been completely destroyed. This reason is also affected by inconvenient transportation. We can understand that only by building highways can we save all the harms. Therefore, the Commander-in-Chief specially convened you to discuss this matter, which is also of particular importance. At the Lushan Conference before, the Commander-in-Chief said that there must be three resolutions to do things now, that is, to do it hard, do it fast, and do it practically. We must take this as the slogan for building highways, and we will definitely achieve satisfactory results. Next, Shi Lun, Qin Fen, Liu Yiyan, Zhang Jingyu, Gong Xuesui, Li Shucheng, Chen Ticheng, and others successively gave speeches. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 am. It was heard that the first meeting to discuss proposals would be held at 9:00 am on the 3rd. (November 2nd)</p>
<h3>Wu Chaochu Talks About His Impressions of the Westward Journey</h3>
<p>The Abundance of Resources in the Northwest Is Startling</p>
<p>Inconvenient Transportation Causes Goods to Be Abandoned on the Ground</p>
<p>Wu Chaochu and his wife recently traveled to Datong with Zeng Guangxiang, Director of the PingSui Railway Bureau, to visit the Yungang Grottoes and then went to Suiyuan to meet with Director Zhao Daiyi. He returned from his journey the other day. When he passed Zhangjiakou that night, he got off the train to visit Feng Yuxiang. He then took the PingSui train south and arrived in Pingmei yesterday morning (31st). James Ranson, the American invader, hosted a banquet for Wu and his wife at the American Embassy at 20:00 yesterday. The reporter visited Wu at the Beijing Hotel in the afternoon and asked about his impressions of the westward journey and his meeting with Feng. Wu said the following: This trip to the Northwest was very short. From Ping to Baotou to Suiyuan, I learned that the coal reserves are extraordinarily abundant, even on the surface. This shows that the abundance of resources in the Northwest is startling. It is said that the local coal sells for only a few yuan per ton, while it costs 20 or 30 yuan per ton in Guangdong. Comparing the two, the huge amount of coal production can be said to be goods abandoned on the ground. It is extremely painful to talk about it. On the way back, I visited the coal mine in Kouquan and inspected the mine. Due to inconvenient transportation and obstructed sales, only five or six tons of coal are produced every day. It is said that the maximum output can reach 1,000 to 3,000 tons per day. However, there are many reasons why this huge amount of coal production cannot be transported to the interior. I have two feelings: (1) The development of the Northwest must have a good government to exempt additional taxes. (2) Seek convenient transportation to sell to various places. At present, the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan have been pacified and are moving towards construction. When passing Baotou, I heard that Zhao Daiyi, the commander of the Baotou Bandit Suppression, was ordered to abolish the position, which shows the local peace. Zeng Guangxiang, Director of the PingSui Railway Bureau, traveled with me this time. When passing Pingdiquan yesterday morning, it was reported that Chairman Zhao Daiyi came to meet me in person. Director Zeng was also present at that time. We agreed to reduce the PingSui freight rate. The provincial government also reduced the cargo damage tax. We jointly planned to transport the products of the Northwest to the interior. Director Zeng expressed his strong support. It is heard that the freight rate has been determined to be reduced. Baotou has reduced by 40%, and the rest has been reduced by 20% or 30%, depending on the situation. However, the PingSui Railway has been declining for many years, and everything is waiting for funds to be built. However, the number of vehicles cannot be increased, and the income cannot be increased. Therefore, developing the resources of the Northwest and repairing the railway is the most urgent task. Also, the Suiyuan Province is currently implementing a land reclamation system, giving each soldier more than ten acres of land to engage in farming. When the country is in trouble, they will take up arms and defend the border. If it can be realized, it is a very good method. In short, the Northwest has a vast territory. If the people of the country can shift their internal focus and pay attention to its development, the country's wealth and strength will be hopeful. Last night, when passing Zhangyuan, Mr. Feng (Yuxiang) sent his secretary Wang Yili to the station to greet me and invited me to get off the train and visit him. We only talked about courteous words and did not discuss anything else. It is heard that Mr. Feng has no opinion on politics and diplomacy. He will not leave Zhang for the time being. He will go elsewhere. After I return to Ping, I will stay for a while and then return south.</p>
<h3>Jinan Opens Ancient Music Exhibition</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Shanghai Datong Music Association sent Yang Shaoyi and Dong Junxiang to Shandong to organize a meeting to solicit members to practice national music. Mr. Yang also agreed with Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library, to hold an exhibition of more than 100 kinds of ancient Chinese musical instruments collected over the past few decades in the library. It opened at 8:00 am today (1st). I went to visit and saw that more than 100 kinds of ancient musical instruments were displayed in the reference book reading room downstairs. The instruments for blowing, plucking, and striking were all available, ancient and lovely. Many visitors were mostly driven by curiosity. There were also those who pointed out the origin of a certain musical instrument and its musical notes, who may be connoisseurs. All the musical instruments, in addition to the commonly seen qin, se, pipa, xiao, and flute, also included the konghou and the hulei, which belong to the silk string plucked instruments. The huqin of Wang Zhaojun is not like the pipa and is smaller and included in the qin music. The hujia of the Eighteen Songs of Hujia can also be appreciated. The jiao is made of cow horn and is a common item in the Mongolian army. It is connected with a long tube to blow it, and its sound is sad. It is said that the Mongols still use it today. The Ruan, made of wood with a round belly and a long neck, is roughly like the modern Yueqin. Its silk strings are plucked with fingers, and its sound is dull. It is said to be the legacy of Ruan Ji of the Jin Dynasty. The most minor instrument made of soil is the fou, shaped like a tea cup. It is the most memorable item at the Mianchi meeting. Another type is the xun, shaped like an inkstone water container. It can be blown at its end to make a sound and is also made of soil. The Boxie blows the xun in the Book of Songs, which should be this item. A large xun is called an instrument. Other instruments, such as the small drum on the stage called the bang drum and the small gong called the xi, also exist among the musical instruments. There is also an instrument called a du, which is like the clapper on the stage that beats the rhythm of the tanban but is smaller. There are many others that have not been seen in the world. Due to time constraints, I have not had time to browse through them all and will have to wait for another day. (October 1st)</p>
<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>A Bomb Was Found in XinCheng Sock Factory: The incident of a bomb being thrown into the XinCheng Sock Factory at the bottom of Xita Lane in this city this morning (3rd) caused a commotion among the neighbors. According to the factory, a bomb resembling a dumbbell used for gymnastics was found at the entrance this morning. Its shape was octagonal at both ends with a stem in the middle, and there was an eyelet with a fuse coiled around the eyelet, pressed by an iron piece. It is estimated that the ignition force of this bomb depended entirely on the fuse. However, the fuse was tightly pressed by the iron piece, so it was not ignited and exploded, which was fortunate. The incident was reported to the Public Security Bureau, which immediately sent inspectors to investigate. They took the unexploded bomb for safekeeping and were carefully investigating the case. The commander of the water and land police force was transferred. Shi Wenhuan, the chief of the second public security sub-bureau of Xunfeng, was suspended by the county public security bureau due to an incident and is awaiting reassignment. The vacancy was filled by Zhang Huaijin, the current captain of the water patrol team. The appointment was announced yesterday. The officers and police of the water patrol team gathered today (3rd) to bid farewell and take photos as a souvenir. Zhang will go to Xunfeng on the 5th to take over. However, the issue of who will succeed the captain of the water patrol team is still being searched for. Many parties are vying for the position, and it is unknown who will win.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Liuhe Cracked Down on Private Sales of Opium: The Liuhe Public Security Sub-Bureau received a secret report the day before yesterday that Du You Teng Tingtao was privately selling opium in the town. Director Ji Zeng received the report and immediately led the police to the address.

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Tax Police Intercepted a Ransom Victim: The salt tax ship stationed in the Welcome Dragon in Fengxian County was on guard duty at 12:00 pm last night (1st). About two miles south of the place, a small boat was seen coming from the north. They suspected that there was smuggling of salt in the boat at night, so they ordered the boat to be inspected. Unexpectedly, the bandits heard the sound of people and swam away to escape. The small boat was detained. A 70-year-old female ransom victim, Yao, was found in the rear cabin. She said that she lived in the northern countryside of Yaqian Town in Pinghu and was kidnapped on the 6th day of the seventh lunar month and had been held for three months. The ransom was too high, so it had not been paid. The captain of the tax ship, considering that the matter was a kidnapping case, sent the bandit boat and the victim to the South Bridge District Department for disposal this morning (2nd).</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Liyang Murder Case Was Steamed in Suzhou for Bone Examination: The case of Xu, the wife of Zhou Sheshu, the owner of a noodle shop in Zhoujiayuan outside the west gate of Liyang County, being strangled to death with a rope by her sister-in-law Zhou Xu and her husband Jin Shu on November 5th of the 16th year of the Republic of China. After the case, in addition to Jin Shu escaping, Zhou Xu and the wet nurse Xu Pan were detained. Zhou Xu was sentenced to death by the Liyang County Government. She refused to accept the original judgment and appealed to the High Court and the Supreme Court. She was sentenced to life imprisonment, which was then reduced to ten years of imprisonment. Xu still refused to accept it and appealed to the Supreme Court again, which was still sent back to the High Court for retrial. Song Yuan, the chief of the criminal division of the High Court, believed that the case was of great importance, so he ordered the coffin to be transported to Suzhou. Yesterday (3rd) at 9:00 am at the Ruiguang Pagoda in Panmen, Guo Rongchun, the examiner of the Zhenjiang District Court, and Da Fang, the examiner of the Wuxian District Court, steamed the bones for examination. The examination had not been completed by the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, which organized a branch of the League of Nations Support Association, has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from the Shanghai League of Nations Support Treaty Committee, urging it to immediately implement economic sanctions against countries that undermine peace, based on the principles of free trade and the principle of merchants' self-determination in accordance with the League of Nations treaty. Luo Qinghua, Deng Chengqing, Ye Jiaxing, and others were appointed to come to Wuxi to take over the preparation and organization of the branch. A meeting of various industries was convened yesterday to discuss the measures. It was decided to organize a Wuxi branch of the League of Nations Support Treaty Committee immediately, based on the articles of association and the organizational rules of the executive department, with one or two representatives appointed by each trade association. Work will begin as soon as the implementation plan and operating rules are sent from Shanghai.</p>
<p>The murderer of the Xianli Mound blood case has been arrested. It was reported that on the 18th of last month, Ji Daxiangshan, the adopted son of Shi Laowu, a resident outside the west gate, was murdered near Xianli Mound. His waist was tied with a large stone, and his body was dumped in the river. After the case was reported, the Public Security Bureau secretly ordered the police to investigate and found clues. Yesterday, the main suspect in the case, Li Buyou (also known as Lu Qilin), was arrested in a straw shed in Cangbangxiang. According to his confession, he was from Yancheng and worked in the Zhenxin Cloth Factory. He stated that the case was committed by three people in total.

<p>Bai Tu Bridge Primary School Robbed. Hui Yousan, the principal of Bai Tu Bridge Primary School in the second district of the county, was fast asleep after 1:00 AM the night before last when more than ten bandits suddenly came, each wielding sharp blades and wooden sticks. They broke into the school and looted at will for about an hour before leaving. After inspection, it was found that clothing and silver dollars worth about two hundred yuan had been stolen.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>The bandit gang at Yao Tan has fled elsewhere. According to a previous secret report to the Civil Affairs Department, a large group of bandits had recently occupied the Yao Tan area bordering Gaoyou and Dou. The department ordered the Sixth District of the Water Police to instruct the Gaobao You Patrol Team to cooperate with the military police of Gaoyou and Dou counties to suppress them. However, when the troops arrived at Yao Tan, the bandits had already fled without a trace. Seven grass sheds, gambling equipment, and paper cigarettes were found in the reed marshes. The reeds have now been cut down by the Bao Ying military police to prevent bandits from hiding there again. The Gao Shen You Patrol Team and the county military police have returned to the city. A kidnapping and robbery case occurred in Baima Town. Dozens of bandits suddenly came to Baima Town the night before last, each armed with guns and weapons. They went to the homes of farmers Zhou Yongmao, Zhou Fangcheng, Jiang Liheng, and others, looting everything. Zhou Daluan and Zhou Juyin were kidnapped.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>The Englishman who shot a farmer is ordered to be transferred to Shanghai by the provincial government. An Englishman named Martin traveled by boat to Fuxingfang, south of Pinghu County, on the 30th of last month to hunt. He mistakenly shot Fei Jinkui, a farmer who was cutting grass in the field. Fei fell to the ground. Nearby villagers took Martin and another Westerner who was hunting with him to the township office and then transferred them to the Pinghu County government for temporary custody that night. The injured farmer was taken to Nanmen Hospital for treatment. Upon receiving the news, the British Consul-General in Shanghai sent a Vice-Consul to Pinghu to investigate. He then telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government, instructing the Pinghu County Magistrate to release the Englishman Martin and send him to the British Consulate in Shanghai for processing. The provincial government, upon receiving the report, telegraphed the Pinghu County Magistrate yesterday to quickly send the Englishman Martin and the other person involved, along with all the evidence, to the Shanghai Municipal Government for transfer to the British Consulate in Shanghai, and to reserve all rights for the victim. The injured farmer is being treated in the hospital, and a diagnosis report should be obtained for future negotiations.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Lu Diping suddenly suffers a stroke. Lu Diping, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, had previously been overworked and ill. He had followed his doctor's advice and went to Mogan Mountain for recuperation. However, due to the provincial government affairs and border defense matters requiring Lu's personal handling, he returned to the province from the mountain the day before yesterday and勉强 went to the government to work. The night before last, at 6:00 PM, the provincial government hosted a banquet to welcome the delegates to the Fifth Provincial Representative Assembly. Lu personally received the guests while enduring his illness and delivered a welcome speech. However, due to his hard work during the day, Lu's body could not bear it any longer. As soon as he finished speaking, he fainted. He was helped by his assistants to the Secretary-General's office, and Dr. Zhang Xinpei was immediately called to administer acupuncture. He regained consciousness at about 10:00 PM. He was unable to leave the government and return home that night. His speech was still slurred this morning. He had a light congee for lunch, and his condition has improved slightly, but he is still resting in the government office. He will look for a house in 靈　鞱光間 to recuperate in the next few days. According to police sources, Lu had previously suffered from insomnia due to high blood pressure. Fortunately, this stroke was a mild one, so there is no threat to his life.</p>

<h3>A More Scientific Teaching Guidance Plan (II) Du Gang</h3>
<p>(1) The organization of teaching guidance should become the center of educational research. In the past thirty years, all aspects of educational scholarship, such as intelligence tests, educational tests, curriculum compilation, teaching systems, teaching techniques, etc., have made great progress. Even the relatively slow-developing teaching guidance has been undergoing rapid changes. Recently, there has been a proposal that teaching guidance should focus on research. In fact, from a practical point of view, if the organization of teaching guidance becomes the center of research and the instructors become experts in educational research, they will naturally gain the trust of teachers and naturally lead teachers to move towards the path of improving teaching.</p>
<p>One, the methods of teaching guidance should be fully scientific. The so-called scientific teaching guidance does not mean that the use of rating standards, inspection records, and counseling record cards is the ultimate. In fact, the most important condition for scientificization is measurability, evidence-based, and systematic planning. For example, before conducting teaching guidance, first investigate the effectiveness of teaching, diagnose its defects, and analyze its causes. Then, based on the defects and causes, formulate a guidance plan to remedy them, measure the results, and estimate the efficiency of the teaching guidance.</p>
<p>(3) From passive criticism to active guidance. The instructor is not just an inspector, but also a counselor. Teachers should not only be given passive criticism, which causes them to lose courage and confidence, but should also be given active encouragement and sympathetic assistance so that they can be creative and progressive. These few words seem easy to say, but they will encounter difficulties everywhere in practice. For example, if the instructor is not very interested in educational research himself, and the organization of teaching guidance itself cannot become the center of research, how can he gain the trust of teachers and achieve the effectiveness of guidance? If the instructor does not have scientific methods and plans, how can he start? Even if he does, it is only a matter of prescribing medicine based on personal subjective opinions without any basis, and the medicine may not be effective. Therefore, to achieve active guidance, the organization of teaching guidance must first become a research center, and the methods of teaching guidance must be as scientific as possible. In general teaching guidance programs, a few principles are first put forward, and then corresponding measures are prescribed for the principles. The principles may not be too abstract and useless for practical teaching, and the measures are too trivial, making people not know where to start or how to proceed. Therefore, after proposing the above three directions of effort, the author will then describe a more systematic teaching guidance plan.</p>
<p>(1) The first step in teaching guidance should be to formulate teaching goals.</p>
<p>(2) Once the teaching goals have been determined, the second step should be to investigate the teaching results. The ultimate goal of teaching guidance is to improve learning effectiveness, so it is natural to first investigate which aspects of learning have defects that need to be improved. This investigation should be conducted regularly.</p>
<p>(3) After a precise investigation, the instructor should further diagnose the defects and analyze the causes.</p>
<p>(4) The instructor should formulate a guidance plan based on the causes of the defects to improve them. The best educational practices should be consulted when formulating the plan.</p>
<p>(5) Measure the effectiveness of teaching guidance. The importance of measurement in teaching guidance is the same as its importance in the teaching process. The instructor must have a clear understanding of the effectiveness of the guidance, and then know how to improve and select guidance techniques.</p>
<p>(6) Scientific methods should be used as much as possible in the research and implementation of teaching guidance. The following is a further description.</p>

<h3>The Charity Basketball Game Encounters Obstacles: Chi Zhi Defeats Datong Last Night</h3>
<p>The result was 27 to 21.</p>
<p>| Only two games were played out of the original four groups |</p>
<p>| Quan Zhang and Chong De teams did not show up |</p>
<p>Tonight, Chi Zhi and Tong Ji will compete in the final.</p>
<p>The first day of the charity basketball game had many problems, and the second day last night was even more complicated. Only the first and fourth groups played out of the original four groups. The second group, Quan Zhang, arrived but did not play. The third group, Chong De, did not advance. It is inevitable that the scene was out of sync. As for why Quan Zhang arrived but did not play, it is said that according to the previous order, Quan Zhang was originally scheduled to play Fudan Shizhong, but yesterday it was suddenly changed to playing Jiangnan. The matter was not notified in advance, so they were unwilling to play. However, the purpose of this competition is to raise money for disaster relief. It is regrettable that those in charge are negligent. However, now that things have come to this, the teams should be more understanding and sacrifice everything and hold the spirit of seeing righteousness and acting bravely to help the scene.</p>
<p>Last night's Group A match between Chi Zhi and Datong was very interesting because the two teams were of similar strength and the competition was fierce. Chi Zhi has a long-standing reputation, while Datong's tenacity and outstanding performance were commendable. In the first half, Datong was always dominant, and Chi Zhi was at a disadvantage. The score was 14 to 12, with a large difference. Datong once led by 14 to 6. In the middle of the second half, Chi Zhi rallied its spirits and was determined to win. Yuan's successful long shot brought the score to 17 to 14, surpassing Datong. However, Datong continued to work hard and did not show weakness, once again taking the lead with a score of 18 to 17. Then, the score became tied at 19 to 19. After that, Chi Zhi 　fought bravely and won with a score of 27 to 21. Referee Qian Yiqin's performance last night was as follows:</p>
<h3>Chi Zhi Defeats Datong... 27 to 21</h3>

<h3>Quan Zhang Basketball Team Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from the Quan Zhang Basketball Team yesterday, saying: Mr. Editor of the Sports Column, I am writing to you. Our school participated in the charity basketball game this time. The association notified our school that we were scheduled to play Fudan Shizhong at the China Basketball Hall at 6:00 PM on November 3. Unexpectedly, our school's team went there tonight and did not see Fudan Shizhong appear. According to the rules of sports, it should be considered a forfeit. However, the person in charge of the competition temporarily notified our school to play against another team. Because our school had not received notice from the association in advance, we considered it not in accordance with the procedures and could not comply. However, a certain gentleman of the association actually wanted to force our school to play against another school with strong words and threatened us, and falsely accused our school of automatically forfeiting. In addition to seriously negotiating with the association, we are afraid of confusing rumors, so we specially sent a staff member to appeal to you to clarify the truth. Respectfully yours, Quan Zhang Middle School Sports Department, November 3, 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Liang Jiang Basketball Team Issues Another Statement</h3>
<p>The Liang Jiang Basketball Team issued a message yesterday, saying: The Liang Jiang Basketball Team denies participating in the charity competition for two reasons. First, the newly organized organization has not specified a disaster area, and it is inconvenient for the participating team to understand the true nature of the organization. The admission tickets sold do not have numbers for statistics. It is heard that the Municipal Education Bureau had an early public order that donation groups initiated by educational institutions should first submit a request to the Education Bureau for review. The school is deeply afraid of engaging in illegal activities, so it denies it. Not only is our school like this, but there are also similar facts in John's and Shanghai. As for not competing, it is purely because the organization did not follow the proper procedures and could not participate, which is completely different from ordinary forfeiture.</p>
<h3>Chi Zhi and Tong Ji Compete in the Final Tonight</h3>
<p>There are a total of three games tonight. The final between Chi Zhi and Tong Ji will be fiercely competitive. The remaining two groups are the semi-finals. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Time Competing Teams Nature of the Game Referee</p>
<p>Starting at 6:00 PM John's vs. Zhengfeng Middle School Group Semi-Final Ni Xiaoben</p>
<p>Starting at 7:00 PM Jiangnan vs. Yu Qing Middle School Group Semi-Final Ying Qiaoshu</p>
<p>Starting at 8:00 PM Chi Zhi vs. Tong Ji University Group Final Qian Yiqin</p>
<h3>Men's and Women's Charity Volleyball</h3>
<p>| At the Track and Field at 1:30 PM Tomorrow |</p>
<p>Women's Group: Wu Ben vs. Hai Xing</p>
<p>Men's Group: Qing Lian vs. Czech</p>
<p>The long-awaited charity volleyball game will be held at the Chinese Track and Field at Laozhaofu Road this Saturday (5th) at 1:30 PM. The women's group, Wu Ben and Hai Xing, meet again on a narrow road. One is with the remaining prestige of the Central Youth Championship, and the other is with the determination to avenge the defeat. Each has a determination to win for the country and for themselves. Who is willing to lag behind? At that time, the intensity of the war will definitely exceed the expectations of ordinary viewers. There is also a men's group, which is Qing Lian vs. Czech. Qing Lian is composed entirely of veterans, and Czech is an up-and-coming star, which is also worth seeing. Tickets are sold for six jiao in small silver coins, and all proceeds will be used to help the Northeast. People in Shanghai who have not had the opportunity to see the skills of Wu Ben and Hai Xing should take the lead to increase their knowledge, which is a win-win situation.</p>

<h3>Fudan Volleyball Team's Mighty Power Remains</h3>
<p>Defeated Shanghai 2 to 1 yesterday.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, the game will be rescheduled.</p>
<p>Fudan Volleyball Team is the leader in the country. Unexpectedly, the team lost to Shanghai in its first appearance at the beginning of this year. The team's ambition has not been extinguished. Therefore, the team re-scheduled Shanghai yesterday (3rd) afternoon at 4:00 PM for a charity match at the school. In the first game, Fudan defeated Shanghai with a score of 22 to 20. In the second game, Shanghai exhausted its efforts and defeated Fudan with a score of 21 to 14. In the third game, Fudan's style and power was revived, and the team won with a score of 21 to 18. It was already late in the game, and the referee announced that the game would be rescheduled. Since the departure of Cao Ting, the backbone figure of Fudan, the team is still full of talents. Judging from today's skills, it is still better than Shanghai. The cause of Jiangnan's dominance is as solid as ever. Other teams may have difficulty winning the championship. The members of both teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Fudan</p>
<p>Front Row Middle Row Back Row</p>
<p>Zhou Jieming Mei Fengqi Chen Bocai</p>

<p>The Middle School Tennis Tournament opened at the China Tennis Court at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. There were originally four schools competing in the preliminary round. However, because Fudan's registration letter was delayed by a postal friend, the order was slightly changed. The war between Shangzhong and Guanghua did not take place. In the evening, Jinan and Chi Zhi competed according to the original schedule. As a result, Jinan defeated Chi Zhi 2 to 0. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lin Tianyuan (Jinan) defeated Wei Wenbing (Chi Zhi) 6 to 0, 6 to 0 (2) Shen Rongbao (Jinan) defeated Yun Fengxi (Chi Zhi) 7 to 5, 7 to 5. Today's competition order is as follows:</p>

<h3>World Female Swimmer Braun, Who Participated in Competitions at the Age of Three</h3>
<p>Bitten by a Poisonous Insect, Leading to Illness</p>
<p>Will No Longer Be Able to Swim for Life</p>
<p>(Reuters, London) The world's female swimmer, the 20-year-old Dutch woman Mrs. Feilepperson, is known as Marie Braun. At the 9th Olympic Games in Amsterdam in 1928, she won the 100-meter backstroke championship and the 400-meter freestyle second place. She may no longer be able to swim for life.</p>
<p>Miss Braun's mother is the director of the Laudertun swimming pool, so Marie learned to swim at the age of two and participated in her first competition at the age of three. When she grew up, in 1927, at the age of sixteen, she won the European women's 400-meter freestyle championship in Bologna, Italy.</p>
<p>Winning again and again, she holds many world records. Her reputation is even greater in England because she often competed against the British female swimmer Miss Hebert. Last year, Marie also won the European women's 100-meter backstroke and 400-meter freestyle. This autumn, she went to Los Angeles to participate in the 10th Olympic Games.</p>
<p>In the Los Angeles 400-meter freestyle preliminary, she was ranked first in the group with the American Ms. Madison. In the 100-meter backstroke preliminary, she was also ranked first. But the tragedy that affected her lifelong swimming career began. Marie was bitten by an insect and poisoned by the blood, leading to illness. As a result, she could not participate in the final and gave up the 400-meter freestyle, which was won by the American Ms. Madison. The 100-meter backstroke was won by the American Ms. Holm.</p>
<p>Marie was only recently able to leave the hospital and will return to the Netherlands via England. After being weakened by the illness, she will fly directly from Liverpool back to her hometown of Laudertun to recuperate.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: In the November 1st issue of your newspaper, in the "Education News" section, there was a piece titled "Obstacles to the Development of Huangdu Rural Teachers' School," which seemed to be Principal Teng Songsheng boasting about his school's achievements. Our group also hopes that this is the case, so as not to waste provincial education funds. However, the last paragraph evaluates our defense force as forging seals, posting slogans indiscriminately, and students being detained, injured, or killed. May I ask how many people have died and how many have been injured? If a student has died, and the principal does not file a lawsuit with the court, he is derelict in his duty. The family members of the deceased are also silent. Could it be that the entire family has died? This news must have been sent by the school. Furthermore, in the "Education News" section of your newspaper on October 29th, there was a piece titled "Head of Huangdu Rural Teachers' School Distributes Leaflets," claiming that our defense force opened fire, which is also not true. This matter occurred because on the 23rd and 25th of last month, students were posting reactionary slogans in the streets. Soldiers of the defense force tried to dissuade them, but they refused. They went to the district office to reason with them. Principal Teng thought the students had been arrested and sent fifty or sixty students to rush into the defense force headquarters, beating one guard and one employee. Our defense force temporarily guarded the students who committed the violence and handed them over to school staff to take back and discipline. This is the truth, which is known to all. Our town's rural teachers' school has been established for more than ten years. All previous principals have had good relationships with local agencies. However, Principal Teng acts arrogantly and often oppresses our defense force. Our defense force has always taken the defense of the locality as its duty and does not argue with others. We request that your newspaper make a correction. Sincerely, to the esteemed editor, the Sixth District Office of the Jiading County Defense Force, 21.11.3.</p>
<h3>New Basketball Techniques (20) ㈥</h3>
<p>(Prohibited) Original by Claire Burcky (Reprint) Co-translated by Zhang Guodong and Qian Yiqin. Mr. J.W. St. Cr, basketball coach at the Southern Methodist University of America.</p>
<p>After intercepting the opponent's ball in our own zone, we use a slow and steady advance and when reaching the opponent's zone we use a quick pass to win. This method is particularly effective against individual defense. The code is one-two-three-four, that is, the players exchange positions with each other. Number five quickly passes the ball to number three, and number three then hooks the ball back to number two, who runs into the free throw area. At the same time, number one rushes forward to block number two's defender, so that number two can receive the ball and immediately pass it to someone under the basket.</p>

<h3>Joy, Anger, Sorrow, and Happiness</h3>
<p>Four Literary Masters, Mr. Hu, He, Bao, and Xu!</p>
<p>Veteran Novelists!</p>
<p>Recently, because they are mostly engaged in political life and have no time to write, ●● the literary world has become less colorful and the art world has become desolate. General novel fans feel lonely. The Bureau felt this and made many requests to get the four gentlemen to allow this great work to be completed. If you take a look at this book, you will taste all the sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy flavors. Joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are involuntary. The book happily depicts several literati who, because their minds are too new, make all kinds of ridiculous things. For example, Old Man Letian advocates beard-cutting movement, Liu Rusheng brothers invent cartoon films, and special race theory, Huang Yizhai organizes kissing associations, Li Guanghua and Xu Yanan invent Wanli marriage method, Cheng Chengzhi advocates students killing teachers, Huo Lizhi implements public intercourse, etc. In the eyes of others, things that are impossible and rebellious, they can all say sufficient reasons and even implement them. It is really laughable. The author, Mr. Hu Jichen (Huaichen), is a master of Chinese studies. He uses his elegant writing style to write such humorous things, just like an eighty-year-old man playing a child's face and falling in love, which makes people relax to the extreme.</p>
<p>The joyful plot: A village teacher explains words to enlighten young children, elementary school students write books to celebrate birthdays, Wang Letian publishes famous remarks on beard cutting, Yang Baichuan discusses the wonderful plan to deceive the world, sings the song of striking the building after drinking wine, and talks about saving the country after dinner. Le Daoren publishes in the newspaper to find his beard, Mr. Zhang recruits people to claim his teeth, promotes the reform of the clock system, and discusses abolishing the names of day and night. Liu Rusheng lectures on new German life, Wang Letian criticizes the old thoughts of ancient people and talks about makeup. A small witch sees a big witch, jokes, fake faces become real faces, imitates comics to invent new films, and wins good reviews. It is difficult to help Wang Letian in publicity. Wonderful words force Xu Qichang to retreat. Secrets are made public. Ten thousand people go to the Xuanhuang meeting. The mysterious saying is broken and laughed at. The field is collected. The two mouths together are just the word "Lu". The long beard is cut off and becomes a fairy. The nine things in life have all become problems. Love triangle is better than cattle and sheep. Female cats miss each other. Actors are proud. Goldfish bathing beauties. Viewers are embarrassed. Viewers give gifts. Teachers send deep meaning. Viewing titles. Writers play tricks. Contradictory debates. Awarded a doctoral degree. Red Mansion race theory. Strange words are shocking. Advocates students killing teachers. Ingenious ideas are unique. Advocate newspapers instead of books. Wanli marriages. Two sides salute. Four-character speech. Work hard to be human. Marry the country. Mediators fail. Publicly marry wives. Claim to be married. Spreading rumors at home. Cheating wives. Qingming poems. Pray to Bodhisattvas. Make an appointment for dinner. Come together with great interest. Chat freely and contribute happily.</p>
<p>Mr. He Haiming has been engaged in political life for many years, so he knows all the secrets and anecdotes of the military and political circles. He is also familiar with brothels and describes the various aspects of brothels with great care. The literary world calls him the unique hand of brothel literature. This book is a description of the family affairs of a great politician in Beiping, and it is full of twists and turns. Among them, a regimental commander prostitutes and uses aphrodisiacs to harm prostitutes, wives and concubines compete for the favor of concubines, masters and servants commit adultery and ravage virginity, and old prostitutes greedy for money abuse sick prostitutes, etc. The writing contains a kind of indignation in the beautiful scenery, which is worthy of the title of this book (Anger). It is truly rare and valuable. Reading this book will surely make you tear your eyes and raise your hair, turning you into an angry King Kong.</p>

The last two chapters can make people shed tears. Pay attention, this is Mr. Bao's first masterpiece since he entered politics, and it is also the pride of sad love novels in recent years.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Quotations from Old Man Ma Xiangbo</p>
<h3>Good Fruit Collection</h3>
<p>— Most Remembered</p>
<p>"Good Fruit Collection" is the title of the donation brochure on behalf of Le Shantang. Old Man Xiang personally wrote the announcement, as follows:</p>
<p>(By the grace of the current Pope Pius XI, the teachings of the Holy Church, etc. ... meaning that the construction of mission areas, nuns' meticulous new homes, should be in line with the needs of the nation and the times, and it is the duty of the bishop to think about the sacredness of his residence. Now, this area (Jiangsu Haimen Chinese Diocese) is fortunate to have donations from the United States for the cultivation of priests. There is a small model farm as the core, and other philanthropic acts that benefit the people's livelihood and the progress of missionary work, such as caring for the sick, caring for the poor, raising infants, caring for the elderly, explaining the principles, teaching scriptures, and from early childhood kindergartens to women's high schools and above, all directors must be dedicated women, loyal and without family burdens, and not doers of merit, suffering is still lacking!</p>
<p>Fortunately, within the district, following the holy call, those who are willing to swear the Gospel of the Three Absolutes are not lacking. They all say that it is appropriate to follow the example of the infant Saint Therese of Jesus as the patron saint and build a women's convent to gather and cultivate them and assign them. However, this area is located in the north of the Yangtze River and is frequently attacked by pirates and bandits, and the situation cannot but call on the elders and brothers of Jiangnan to help make this philanthropic work a success. One side of the courtyard rules stipulates that ... two nuns should attend the Holy Mass and receive the sacraments every day, to pray for the benefactors to God for boundless blessings ... without error and without forgetting!)</p>
<p>Old Man Xiang specially referred to (the infant Saint Therese of Jesus) in the article, which is worth introducing to readers of the quotations, so that they can know what kind of person she is ... If you understand her clearly, you will be guaranteed to have your requests answered!</p>
<p>Old Man Xiang once told me ... (If a Western lady and young lady come to see me, I will at most get up to greet them and nod! But this saint, tens of millions of believers pay their respects to her ... of course, I, an old man, cannot be an exception! Because her virtue is so high that she can unite with the Holy Will of the Savior ... unlike ordinary people who are self-respecting and arrogant! Meek and humble, she has become the greatest saint among the deceased great men in the modern world!) Whenever religious problems arise, Old Man Xiang often says ... (Please ask this great saint to intercede ... we are just small errand boys!)</p>
<p>When Old Man Xiang was almost ninety years old, he personally translated the saint's autobiography, (The Little Story of the Soul). He also wrote couplets to express his respect: (Pray for your ten thousand rains of roses: inspire me with a pure heart)</p>
<p>(Note) Old Man Xiang's translation (The Little Story of the Soul) was published by the Shanghai Tushanwan Printing House and is now in its third edition.</p>
<h3>East and West</h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>｜Dependence and Independence｜</p>
<p>Speaking of the East and the West, there is a difference in emphasis, which is dependence and independence. These two kinds of root causes have created two different nations, ! Weak and strong.</p>
<p>In the East, there is no shortage of philanthropists who regard giving alms to beggars as their only virtue, while Western philanthropists are the opposite. Once, a Chinese and a Western friend went to Hangzhou together. Hangzhou's beggars are the best in the world, a special occupation outside the 360 trades. Many poor children are taught begging skills by their parents from an early age and run around in the streets. If you travel to Hangzhou, then you will feel that the only thing that hinders your pleasure is the beggars all over the mountains and streets. At that time, the Chinese and his Western friend traveled to Lingyin, and a child begged them, following them for more than half a mile. At first, everyone did not give, but in the end, the Chinese was still Chinese, and out of pity, he gave him a copper coin. The Western friend said ... (The lesson we just taught him is now all ruined by you. This is not a problem of one copper coin, but a problem of his whole life. You are harming him! Cultivating his dependence, not saving him.) His words were full of regret. The same thing, the same thing to calculate that small</p>
<h3>Social Snippets</h3>
<p>— Qiwo</p>
<p>In the barber shop</p>
<p>The barber poured him a cup of tea. (Humph! The teacup is Japanese, I won't drink it!) He tilted his head and looked at the bottom of the teacup, saying so proudly.</p>
<p>In an instant, the barber combed his hair and asked ... (Sir, do you still want to part it the same way?)</p>
<p>(Um)</p>
<p>(Ha, sir, I have to use Japanese scissors again!)</p>
<p>(What? The scissors are Japanese? No! Isn't there any foreign goods?)</p>
<p>(No! Sir, the scissors used in barber shops are all Japanese goods, and only Japanese goods are good. Sir, otherwise you can shave your head, so you don't need Japanese scissors.)</p>
<p>(Ah ... then ... still part it the same way ... just use it once ...)</p>
<p>child, you can see the difference in the national character between the East and the West. Westerners value independence, while some parts of China in the East are inevitably dependent. You see, the means of transportation invented in the West is the automobile, while the one invented in the East, Japan, is the rickshaw, which is ten thousand times different between the two. This is a small matter, but even more so from the larger ones. The weapons that the West uses to deal with others are (airplanes,) (battleships,) (tanks,) asserting themselves ... while the weapons that the East uses to defend against the enemy are (hunger strike,) (telegram,) a statement,) hoping to gain the pity of others. Without asking whether it is a matter of a country or a matter of a factory, whether the weak behavior of (hunger strike) (telegram) (issuing a statement) can achieve victory, even a child knows that it will not succeed, but it is actually discovered in the political history of the twentieth century. Is this not a manifestation of slavery, the shame of the East?</p>
<h3>An Era of Turning Backwards</h3>
<p>— Chuan Hong</p>
<p>｜Discovering within Society｜</p>
<p>Most people seem to say, "The times are moving forward!" But in reality, have the times ever truly moved forward? We only need to pay a little attention within society to discover that what we see are all instances of "turning backwards." The times have probably already reached the point of "when things reach an extreme, they revert."</p>
<p>Here, let's start with modern women. In the beginning, when transitioning from the old to the new, women were only concerned that their clothes were not short enough or their collars not low enough. They despised the old-fashioned Qing dynasty attire. But what about now? They are desperately pulling their clothes down longer and longer, their collars are exceedingly high, and their high heels, at the very least, bear some resemblance to the elevated-sole shoes of the Qing dynasty. Everything is gradually running backwards. As for men, with their watermelon-style skullcaps, bound trousers, and shallow-cut shoes, they are also eagerly trying to revive the past. Where, then, is the so-called "progress"?</p>
<p>When vernacular Chinese was first promoted, even the chirping of a bird could be turned into two poems, and the quarreling of cats and dogs could become an essay. How magnificent! The words "de ma le na" were so worthy of everyone's reverence. But today, the new figures writing in vernacular Chinese have all turned their pens to circling and annotating Southern Song lyrics or Tang poems. What is the meaning of all this? Recently, those fashionable people, the celebrities, what have they all been doing? (The Kalachakra Tantra Ritual). The sounds of gongs and drums are deafening, and incense smoke is swirling. In this era, where would we believe that such strange phenomena could occur? But in fact, the evidence is clearly displayed before our eyes. The times are simply turning backwards!</p>
<h3>A Classmate's Unmarried Fiancée</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhenyue</p>
<p>｜The Life of a Child Bride in an Evil Family｜</p>
<p>This is a true story from sixteen years ago. At that time, I was studying at a small school not far from my home. Every day, on my way to school, I would always pass by the house of my classmate, Zhao Haiwen. Sometimes, when returning from school, my classmate Zhao Haiwen would always invite me to his house to eat biscuits and play with dolls. Because I was very afraid of his mother, although I went in, I never dared to stay long.</p>
<p>The strangest thing was Zhao Haiwen's unmarried fiancée, a child bride. She was ten years old that year. A ten-year-old girl, of course, should have been a good, innocent, lively, and exquisite treasure. But I never saw a smile on her face, nor did I ever see her playing with anyone. I only saw that her eyelids were often reddened by a tear.</p>
<p>One day, as I was going to school, just as I passed by Zhao Haiwen's house, I suddenly heard a very mournful sound, as if Zhao Haiwen's unmarried fiancée was crying and shouting, "It hurts… Mother, please forgive me…" Interspersed with the sound was a series of cracking sounds, like bamboo strips hitting someone.</p>
<p>Roll call at school; Zhao Haiwen, who always arrived every day, was absent today for some reason. It was already noon when I went home for lunch. I passed by Zhao Haiwen's house again. I couldn't help but be shocked. It turned out that my classmate Zhao Haiwen was crying at the door. I hurried to comfort him and ask him the reason for his crying. Haiwen answered me like this: "She broke a bowl this morning, so my mother beat her to death."</p>
<p>Brief News from Local Area: The "Lion Power" beef juice and chicken juice managed by the German Wada Pharmacy on the fifth floor of the mainland commercial building are manufactured using the latest cold-pressing method by the German Marl Pharmaceutical Factory. They are effective in increasing essence, nourishing blood, and stimulating appetite. They are reliable daily supplements. Therefore, their business is also second to none. Buyers must pay attention: anything with just "one Lion character" is not the genuine product, nor is anything with only "one Power character." Be sure to recognize the three characters "Lion Power" to ensure they are genuine German goods, it says.</p>
<h3>Dead End (4)</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>II. Adapting to the Times</p>
<p>(Ai Gu…")</p>
<p>Ai Gu, who had transitioned from a child bride in a farming family to a maid in a wealthy urban household, was sitting in a springy chair in the outer room, staring blankly at the small, golden-orange clock on the dressing table, one, two, three… silently listening to its sharp, clear chimes, while counting. When she reached ten, the chimes stopped somberly, and she heard from the adjacent room, |The Young Mistress Han's Bedroom|, a light, reproachful voice, calling out, "Ai Gu." As if awakening from a dream, Ai Gu stood up, responded with a drawn-out "Ah," lowered her footsteps, and walked into the bedroom. She saw on the golden-orange bed a woman like a celestial being, enveloped by thin, misty gauze curtains, her face turned outwards. Although she couldn't see her clearly, she was not the same woman with slender eyebrows as she had met for the first time yesterday. Her skin was white with a reddish tinge, and her lips were scarlet. If one didn't hear her voice, one would almost suspect she was another woman. She had no time to study the reasons for the transformation; she had to heed her next command. She saw her stretch out a slender hand from the pink silk quilt, pointing to the chamber pot stand by the bed, saying…</p>
<p>"Turn off the light!"</p>
<p>This task made Ai Gu so embarrassed that she almost cried. Although she had understood the mystery of the electric light from her clever observations last night – that all she had to do was press a small button on a copper plate on the wall to turn it on, and press it again to turn it off – but in this bedroom, all the walls were covered with paintings of naked swimming children that she used to see in the countryside in summer, and images of foreign women, set off by bold, leafy patterns. She couldn't find a single small button.</p>
<p>"Stupid thing!" Young Mistress Han said with a disdainful air, propping herself up halfway. She felt a small, golden-orange gourd on the chamber pot stand, mumbling, "The switch is here." With a "snap," a dish of white grapes held in the hands of a swimming child on the chamber pot stand suddenly lost its yellow light. Ai Gu carefully looked at the small gourd a few times, inexplicably remembering… "This is also a kind of switch."</p>
<p>"Go and tell the newcomer to put the lotus seed soup on the electric stove, and when it's boiling, bring it in. Get some cold water from the coal stove."</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Significant Fluctuations in Finance and Gold Markets</h3>
<p>Down Three Taels and Seven Mace: Yesterday's volatility was quite significant. It rose and fell repeatedly, with a difference of eight taels between the highest and lowest points throughout the day, making it difficult to navigate. The final result was a drop of three taels and several mace. The intentions of the industry were confused. The morning started with a slight rise, supposedly due to a decline in the silver market, as well as reports of twenty-one small banks closing in the United States, leading to tighter foreign exchange rates. Foreign merchants were eager to settle accounts, and buying interest on the trading floor intensified. Because of this, the market price gradually rose, exceeding 750 taels. Suddenly, news came from abroad about unfavorable conditions in the gold market, saying that the United States intended to purchase silver ingots to make up for budget shortfalls. This caused immediate anxiety and caution against a major surge. Furthermore, the Guangdong contingent aggressively dumped, causing prices to plummet rapidly, falling by more than seven taels. The market stabilized somewhat at noon, but there were no major fluctuations in the afternoon. However, Hengxing's selling pressure remained strong, and prices ultimately fell below 744 taels. All November contracts, which had been sold short by Ruikang, Dingchang, and others to Tongfeng and Heng, covering more than 200 contracts, were posting a loss of between 1.9 and 2 taels. The past conditions of the market are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>The Morning Market Advanced and Retreated Sharply</p>
<p>Early in the morning, December opened at 749.5 taels, up 2.1 mace. It was said that the US bank telegrams were shrinking by one-eighth, but the market situation was firm, the exchange rate rose, and Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, Yongfeng, Yifeng, Yiyifeng, Yongyuanxing, Yongdeng, and others were selling off, causing the price to drop by more than three taels to 46.2 taels at 9:15. After a while, Linghu and Hengchangyong and others came to buy, with banks also buying January US dollars at 30.0625, reaching 48.1 taels by 9:30. Subsequently, Huifeng listed the exchange rate without any changes. Internally, Huifeng's appetite was quite good, having absorbed 8.125 in November. With forward prices at 0.0625, buyers were active on the trading floor, and the price advanced rapidly. Hengyu, Fuyu, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Yuanmao, Yongzhaofengchang, Daxingyong, Zhifengyong, and others were all vying to purchase, especially because Mobil, British American Tobacco, and others were constantly seeking to settle US dollars, with January at only 0.9375 and November at 0.75, so the price of gold reached 51.2 taels by 11:00. Hengxing and Yifeng then sold off, immediately turning back to 50 taels. Zhaofengchang, Fuyu, Dadecheng, Hengchangyong, Hengxingyuan, and Dalian gangs all came to sell, and short covering also occurred. In just ten minutes, the price rose by three taels to 46.3 taels. However, Yifeng, Yuantai, Futaiheng, and others sold, and it retreated again by more than two taels to 4.7 taels at 11:30. It was closed at 5.7 taels, which was Linghu covering. The afternoon market selling pressure was not weak. The afternoon market opened at 46 taels. Hengyu sold, bringing it down to 44.6 taels. Then, because the silver companies bought forward US dollars at 1.25, and Huifeng also absorbed January first at 6875, Yuanmaoyong and others bought and added 1.5 taels, reaching 6.1 taels at 2:45. After that, Hengxingzhifengyong, Hengyutianfengyong, Yifengyong, and Linghu collectively sold off, and January US dollars also required 1.25, so the market saw a loosening and the price of gold fell further, reaching 43.5 taels at 4:00, with a difference of only one tael in one hour. Fuchangbingxing then pursued and added six or seven mace to reach 4.2 taels. The situation then became increasingly sluggish, and Hengxing repeatedly dumped, dropping by one tael, eventually closing at 43.2 taels. Bingxing then entered again, reaching 3.7 taels at 4:30 to close, compared to the previous day, a drop of 3.7 taels. The maximum for the entire day was 51.2 taels, the minimum was 43.2 taels, a difference of eight taels. The bare margin increased by only 1.1 taels. It was rumored that the Central Bank entered the spot market in the morning, buying 210 contracts, but this was inaccurate.</p>
<p>The Marked Price Was Mostly Suppressed by Four Taels: The marked price remained at 810 taels, with a discount of approximately 62 to 60 taels. It was 67 taels at noon and 64 taels in the afternoon. The morning price was 67 taels, four taels more discounted compared to the previous day. The registered amounts were 48 taels and 46 taels, with supplementary water at 47 taels and 45 taels. Trading in the market was brisk, and trading on the trading floor was quite active. Statistics show that Hengyu and Yuanheng bought 700 to 800 contracts, Yuanmaoyong, Fuyu, and Yifengyong all bought 400 contracts, and Fuchang, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Qianchangxiang, Zhaofengchang, and Daxingyong each bought 200 to 300 contracts.

Dadecheng sold about 1,000, and Bingxing also sold 300 to 400 contracts. In the afternoon, Changmaoyong, Wanxing, Bingxing, and Fuchang all bought, and Dadecheng, Yuanchun, Yifengyong, and Hengyu both entered and exited. Tongtaichang, Zhifengyong, and Hengchangyong all exited, while the rest were mixed, with no large amounts. The Dalian gang sold a total of 300 contracts and bought 500 contracts throughout the day. Yifeng of the Guangdong gang sold a total of 2,000 in the morning, of which more than 1,000 were on behalf of Hengyu, and Hengxing sold 500 and then bought 400. In the afternoon, another 1,700 contracts were sold, with Yifeng seldom mentioning it.</p>
<p>Autumn Races Next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday Only in the Morning Market: Next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday (November 7, 8, and 9), due to the Western merchants' autumn horse racing season, the Gold Exchange will only be open for half a day in the morning, because all banks will be closed in the afternoon as usual, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Sterling Steady, US Dollar Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market reported a decline, and the exchange rate showed sterling steady and the US dollar rising. There were slight changes in the local foreign exchange market, but the situation stabilized. Huifeng listed the exchange rate without any changes. The domestic market was steady in the morning, then rose and loosened due to Reuters' news that the United States might buy raw silver to balance the budget. The gold price then went from high to low, and the exchange rate also took a hit. The afternoon then trended to be steady. The final result compared to last year was sterling level, and the US dollar rose by only 0.025. However, because the gold price had already fallen by more than three taels, the settlement was only 4 taels more, at 66 and 67 taels. Chinese merchants traded diligently, with sterling traded around 100,000, with various amounts bought and sold. Banks also did some offsetting transactions. US dollars totaled approximately 1 million, with Mobil and British American Tobacco continuing to settle, totaling more than 200,000. Silver companies entered the forward market, and Guangdong merchants Hengxing and Shengda all sold. All gold shops generally sold and covered, with some profit to be made.</p>

<h3>The Great Silver Bar Rose by 0.0625</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 3rd: The great silver bar rose. The closing price for the near term was 18 pence 125, and the far term was 18 pence 25, each rising by 0.0625 compared to the previous day. The Anglo-American exchange rate opened at 3 yuan, 2 jiao, and 9.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Interest Soft, Money Market Steady, Subsidiary Coins Rise ｜Copper Coins Suddenly Shrink by 2,500 Strings ｜</h3>
<p>Since the financial market has undergone the final consolidation of long-term loans due at the end of October, various commercial sectors outside have been unable to turn around, and the market's straits have gone without saying. The silver and money industry, concentrating cash and refusing to fully supply it, knows that there is no possibility of activity in the market in the short term. As such, they have slightly reduced trade on various businesses. As a result, the demand for silver dollars has weakened, and there is a real fear that the trend of silver dollars will become flat and sluggish.</p>
<p>Interest Slightly Lower, Money Market Up One Cent (Silver Interest) The early market interest rate was 7 mace and 6 li, down 0.25 hao from the previous noon. The noon market continued to be down 0.1125 hao, at 7 mace, 5 li, and 8 hao, 7 hu. The final result was a total drop of 0.375 hao between the two markets, and the situation has not changed much. (Silver Draft) Both the morning and noon markets opened at 5 fen, a 1-fen increase from the previous day. Because there was a surplus of cut head water, no one accepted it, let alone added water.</p>
<p>Corner Coins All Rose, Copper Coins Continued to Shrink: The early market for Jiangnan small dollars was 6 qian, 1 fen, and 8 li, an improvement of 1 li from the previous noon. The noon market rose even more than the early market by 1 li, calculated at 6 qian, 1 fen, and 9 li. As a result, it rose by a total of 2 li. Trading was 5,500 corner coins in the morning market and 7,500 corner coins in the noon market. The early market for Guangdong small dollars was 5 qian, 9 fen, and 8 li, 7 hao, a further improvement of 1 li compared to the previous noon market. The noon market was the same as the early market. Trading was 145,000 corner coins in the morning market and 30,000 corner coins in the noon market. Due to strong buying interest, the copper coins were slightly hoarded by many parties, resulting in a sharp reduction of 2,500 strings, to 420,000 strings. Trading was over 50,800 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Receipts, Settlements, and Transactions All Slackened: (Silver Funds) The bank's receipts and settlements yesterday were quite deserted. The receipt of funds from Chinese merchants was 2.67 million, similar to the previous few days, while the foreign merchants' receipts and settlements were noticeably less, only 1.45 million. The various goods, exchange taxes, and other funds totaled 9.23 million, advances totaled 1 million, and pledged funds transactions totaled 1.4 million. Special funds totaled only a few hundred thousand, and 1.2 million was withdrawn from the warehouse. The money shops and public silver offices received and settled over 28 million, and cut head funds received and settled over 4.22 million. The various exchange funds received and settled over 800,000, and cash receipts totaled over 100,000. (Dollar Funds) The morning market exchange ticket funds made out 950,000, and the noon market made out only 225,000. The early morning banknotes were 85,000, and the noon market was 50,000. Off-market banknotes were 115,000 in the morning and 95,000 in the afternoon. Payment slips were 65,000 in the morning and 45,000 in the afternoon. The inter-market morning market purchases and sales by banks were 900,000, and the noon market inter-market purchases and sales were 300,000. The various banks' dollar accounts received and settled over 1.3 million. The dollar banknote inflows and outflows were 1.45 million. The passenger road went to the stomach for over 600,000. The dollar pledge fund transactions were 400,000. The money shops' dollar public bills received and settled 6.2 million. The dollar cut head funds received and settled over 1.7 million.

<h3>The End of the Long-Term News</h3>
<p>Most of the various types of long-term deposits due at the end of the 10th of this month have been completely consolidated and cleared up during the month. However, there are still quite a few who have not been able to clear up on schedule. According to people in the industry, those who can pay back, whether in small or large amounts, should pay whatever they can. The shortfall can only be transferred to current accounts so that they can be repaid at any time. This amount is also considerable, estimated to be no less than two to three million. Now the banks are trying to find ways, such as using credit goods to make pledges for loans and issuing IOUs to set repayment dates, or re-transferring short-term (such as February 3, etc.) loans in order to gradually collect payments. All new transactions have not been seen or heard of, indicating that it is indeed difficult to make loans now, and those who need loans to turn around are even more embarrassed.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Rose by About Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>｜Transactions Totaled 4.5 Million Yuan｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange traded many types of bonds. Spot trading totaled 42,000 yuan, of which salt tax accounted for 19,000 yuan and 20-year customs accounted for 13,000 yuan. The other types were still scarce. The futures market saw prices rise again, and the market trading was quite active. The number of buyers and sellers was more active than before. It is estimated that the morning transaction volume was 1.7 million yuan, and the afternoon transaction volume was 2.7 million yuan, totaling 4.46 million yuan. Among them, the total amount of uniform salt tax, 20-year customs, and demobilization was about 700,000 yuan, and the 20-year rolling bond was 620,000 yuan. Only the remaining amount was relatively flat. The 96-year customs tax and whole 6th-grade bonds remained clear. The situation of the various bonds was that the morning was more sluggish, and the supply and demand in the market were clear. The price fluctuation was extremely slight compared to the previous day. The second market turned slightly firm, but the fluctuation was still slight. The subsequent market continued to lack major changes, especially because the number of buyers in the market was more active, so the price gradually rose, and the result was five or six jiao better than the previous day. Only the 1919 customs bond spot price rose nearly three yuan compared to last month. The market situation of the compensation bonds is still quite stable, it is said.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Continued to Decline</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Trading Company reported that on Wednesday (2nd), the New York stock market saw the liquidation of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway being announced. Railway stocks first fell, and trading suddenly became active. In total, the stocks fell by one to five yuan each. The total number of shares traded for the day was 1.1 million. According to the Iron and Steel Century Magazine, the steel workload this week was 20%, which was 1% better than last week. In November, the automobile industry and railways seemed to need a large amount of steel for the manufacture of automobiles and railway equipment, but orders will be temporarily undecided before the election results are announced. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Yarn, Flower, and Yarn Markets Are Gradually Showing Signs of Decline</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is trending sluggish, gradually showing signs of decline. Because the environment is too bad, it is really necessary to be calm, and all parties are subject to financial constraints, and yarn sales are very dull, which has led to the deterioration of people's hearts. As for the current month's standard yarn, the seller already has a large number of chips. If the customer sales have not been launched for a long time, it is rumored that there will be a full amount of delivery later. A certain factory's yarn is very willing to open up, so the pressure is getting heavier and the market atmosphere is quite weak.</p>
<h3>American Cotton is Weak, and People's Hearts are Softened</h3>
<p>In the early market, the opening was marked by weak American cotton, softening people's hearts. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and the price of each month fell by 2.4 qian. In the afternoon, the situation became even more virtual, and each month fell by 3, 5, 6, and 9 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 12,700 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 700 bales, Yicheng 500 bales, Daji 500 bales, Shenxin 600 bales, Xincheng 750 bales, and Gengfeng 450 bales. Suilong bought 650 bales, Changji 450 bales, Rongxing 400 bales, and Yongda 450 bales. The closing price is listed below.</p>

<p>Inland 80 Guangdong 25 Xiamen 35 Jiangxi 1</p>
<p>Shantou 15 Luzhou 5 Anqing 10</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending sluggish, and the trend of decline is gradually rising. This is because American cotton is weak, the situation is bleak, and American prices have fallen sharply and gold prices are trending down, which has caused people's hearts to become even more worried, and the selling pressure has suddenly risen. Therefore, the recent decline has been more severe, approaching the 30 tael mark. However, the sellers in the distant month are more gentle, and the market situation is a bit stronger. The actual need in the market has stalled, and each factory has no buying volume. In short, the environment is too bad, and the market situation is difficult to stabilize. However, there are some who are watching from the sidelines due to the bottom line relationship, it is said.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Dropped Four Qian</h3>
<p>The Zheng standard opened in the early market with American cotton still soft, with mixed gains and losses. Each month fell by 5 fen to 1 qian, and the air became even weaker in the afternoon. Each month fell by 2.5 fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 42,000 dan. It was found that Mingde sold 3,300 dan, Jifeng 1,100 dan, Changfeng 3,200 dan, Xincheng 5,400 dan, and Yuchang 1,600 dan. Suilong bought 2,500 dan, Changji 2,600 dan, Yuanda 2,200 dan, Dafu 1,000 dan, and Yukang 1,000 dan. The closing price is listed below.</p>

<h3>Need for Raw Cotton Clarification</h3>

<h3>Foreign Cotton Remains Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was stable. At closing, it weakened due to the Wall Street downturn and Southern hedging. Futures prices fluctuated by 1 to 2 points. Spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures fell by 1 to 3 points, and spot prices fell by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 1 point. The Indian cotton market was quiet. Pingguoer fell by 4.25, Robiao La fell by 4.5, and Robi Bai Luo Creek fell by 3.75 (Second day telegram)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Flower Market Calm, Yarn Stiff</h3>
<p>Flower (1st day) Tianjin report: The Xihe flower market is fair, but purchasing interest has shrunk. Shanghai merchants have not yet begun trading. Western merchants and He Ping &amp; Co. bought 200 bales, offering 24 taels. Other foreign merchants bought 200 bales, offering 23 taels and 6 qian. The Xihe American cotton market is flat. Due to continuous strong sales, speculative buyers have slightly reduced inventory. Tong Fu &amp; Co. bought 100 bales, offering 28 taels and 8 qian, unchanged from before.</p>
<p>Yarn (1st day) Tianjin report: Cotton yarn transactions have been slightly active in recent days, and buyer interest is gradually increasing. Yarn merchants have slightly strengthened their position, but both sides are holding back, so no deals have been made.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Changes from Weak to Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday in South Shanghai, arrivals from various routes were insufficient. Sales in the local market were flat. Changshu and Xibei japonica rice opened lower by a small amount. Old and broken rice also followed, down a small five fen. Sales of six types of kiln-dried rice were average, with no increase or decrease. Yishi Xing white rice was stable. The total volume traded for the day was approximately 1,500 dan.</p>
<p>Yesterday in Xin Zha, seven or eight boats arrived from inland regions along the Suzhou River. Sales in urban and rural areas were average. Kiln-dried rice was firm, while lower-quality rice was slightly weaker, down 1 jiao and a half. Changshu, Yixing, and Danyang japonica rice were sold as soon as they arrived, and prices were stable. Yin Yuan's purchasing interest was low, showing a downward trend.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Market Turns Active</h3>
<p>｜Fuzhou Handles Newly Arrived Xiang Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice turned active, and local merchants inquired. The market changed from weak to stable, but the number of transactions did not increase significantly. Purchasing interest remained strongest for Fuzhou merchants. They purchased 200 bags of small milled rice and also purchased all of the newly arrived Hunan rice, buying regardless of price. Local merchants had not shown interest for many days. Yesterday, they purchased 100 bags of Saigon No. 1 and 500 bags of small milled rice, with small milled rice opening at 8 yuan, followed by 7 yuan and 6-7 jiao. Saigon No. 1 was 9 yuan. Over 1,000 bags of Hunan rice continued to arrive. Besides a small amount purchased by Beiyang merchants at about half a yuan, all were purchased by Fuzhou merchants. Hunan machine-milled rice opened at 9 yuan and 2 jiao, machine Jing rice at 9 yuan, Jing rice at 8 yuan and 3 jiao, and machine-milled rice at 10 yuan and 1 jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Continues to Decline After Reopening</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the flour market exchange remained closed due to the unresolved margin call issue. In the afternoon, as the margin call issue was resolved, only a few brokers who had not fulfilled their obligations were restricted from entering the market, and trading resumed as usual. Initially, sentiment was stable because foreign wheat had fallen the previous day but rose slightly yesterday. Therefore, buying and selling were relatively peaceful. However, because the overseas atmosphere remained unfavorable, Australian wheat prices gradually weakened and were close to dumping prices. It was heard that 240,000 bags of foreign flour scheduled to be shipped in March at 1 tael and 6 qian and a half had already been traded. With the simultaneous arrival of flour and wheat, if factories disregarded the overall situation, they would be cutting off their own livelihoods. Therefore, Fufeng took the opportunity to sell off, and market sentiment continued to decline. What is perplexing is that spot prices are still rising, which does not reflect the actual low prices of goods. As a result, December prices were lower by 5 li per bag, January prices were down 1 fen and 2.5 li, February prices were down 1 fen and 3 li, March prices were down 1 fen and 2.5 li, and April prices were down 7.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Trading Actively</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market generally showed a stable and active trend in the morning and afternoon after the opening. Foreign wheat prices were slightly better, up 1 jiao. Although the overseas atmosphere remained unfavorable, the arrival of spot wheat in the local market was indeed sparse, and factory demand remained good. Therefore, major short sellers gradually covered their positions and sold off spot goods. As a result, sentiment in the near term strengthened. However, with the dumping of foreign wheat, there is little hope for a substantial increase in prices. As a result, this month's prices were better by 4 fen compared to the previous day, December's prices were better by 2 fen, January's prices were better by 3 fen, and there were no changes in other months. The spot wheat market was quite active. Ciyao Bay wheat opened at 3 taels and 3 qian and a half.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: No Turnaround in Silk Sales to Europe and America</h3>
<p>Recently, the exchange rate remains weak. European and American markets continue to receive silk from Chinese silk factories. The decline in raw silk prices remains sharp, making it increasingly difficult for factory agents to raise prices. Chinese silk merchants believe that losses are too great and their attitude is passive. Yesterday, only Yihe and Dachang purchased 15 packages of Lu Huang from factory agents, and Samsung purchased 24 packages of yellow coarse silk.</p>
<p>Fifty Pieces of White Factory Silk Shipped to Hangzhou</p>
<p>Recognizing that the prices of white factory silk from foreign firms have fallen drastically and that silk weaving factories in Hangzhou urgently need white factory silk for winter silk fabrics, they took the opportunity to actively purchase it in Shanghai. The sales of spot white factory silk were quite strong last month, and the purchased quantity reached over 300 packages. They are now being shipped to Hangzhou in batches. Yesterday, it was calculated that 50 pieces of white factory silk were transported to Chang'an, Genshanmen, and other stations on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated Sugar and White Sugar Market Sentiment Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to decline and trading was sluggish, resulting in very weak sentiment. The association's prices for the 24th grade coarse granulated white sugar were 14 taels and 9 qian and a half for high-quality goods and 14 taels and 9 qian for ordinary goods. There were more sellers than buyers, resulting in a lack of transactions. The 20th grade medium granulated white sugar was priced at 14 taels and 3 qian, slightly down 1 qian from the previous day. The 18th grade medium granulated white sugar was 14 taels. He Chi No. 8 new goods were 11 taels and 7 qian, stable. Old goods were 11 taels and 1 qian. No. 90 He Chi old goods were 11 taels and 5-6 qian. Trading was sparse and showed slight weakness. Bowl blue sugar sales have slowed down and a large amount has been shipped in, lowering the price to 9 taels and 5-6 qian. Cotton He white high-quality goods were 15 taels and 4 qian and a half. Jianbang's new arrival of 130 packages of local white sugar was offered at 14 taels and a half but has not yet been traded.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Heavy Woolen Fabrics Soft, Light Woolen Fabrics Trend Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend for woolen fabrics remained stable. Retail and wholesale transactions were still very active, but market sentiment was mixed. Heavy goods such as overcoat woolens were soft, while light goods such as serge were firm. This was due to the different levels of sales. Plaid Walter woolens were very popular and have already increased in price to 3 taels. Plain grey Walter woolens, Hanling Peng suit woolens, and riding breeches woolens were all very popular. Plain heavy woolens, mixed woolens, and ordinary plaid colorful flashing overcoat woolens were trending soft. Good quality colorful overcoat woolens were falling steadily, selling for 3 taels and 7 qian. Business Price List.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Issues 6 Million Yuan in Public Bonds</h3>
<p>For the Reconstruction of the Municipality After the January 28th Incident</p>
<p>Regulations Have Been Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Review</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency Nanjing Correspondence: The Central Political Conference held its 330th meeting on the 2nd. The Executive Yuan submitted a report from the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating: "During the January 28th Incident, areas such as Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Zhenru were devastated as war zones, with shops and residences reduced to ashes. Although several months have passed since the takeover, the scene remains desolate. Shanghai is the commercial and cultural center of the country, and the focus of both domestic and international attention. Planning for reconstruction is imperative. However, due to severe shortages in the treasury, replenishment is difficult. After repeated deliberations, the only option is to adopt a public bond policy to facilitate adjustments. It is proposed to issue 6 million yuan in Post-War Reconstruction Municipal Bonds, with the municipal government's income from donations and taxes serving as the principal and interest repayment fund, specifically for beneficial construction projects in the city. Detailed regulations and a principal and interest repayment schedule are submitted for review and approval." The Executive Yuan's 74th meeting resolved to pass the proposal, and the original regulations and principal and interest repayment schedule are copied and submitted for review in principle by the Legislative Yuan. The Shanghai Municipal Post-War Reconstruction Municipal Bond Regulations are transcribed below:</p>
<h3>Municipal Bond Regulations</h3>
<p>Article 1: The Shanghai Municipal Government, for the purpose of reconstructing municipal projects after the war, will issue 6 million yuan in public bonds, designated as the Shanghai Municipal Post-War Reconstruction Municipal Bond. Article 2: The interest rate for these public bonds is set at 7% per week. Article 3: These public bonds will be issued in January of the 21st year of the Republic of China [1932]. Article 4: Interest will be paid on these public bonds annually at the end of April and October. Article 5: Starting from April of the 22nd year of the Republic of China [1933], repayment of these public bonds will be conducted through a lottery system over twenty years. Two lotteries will be held each year, with the total amount repaid in accordance with the principal and interest repayment schedule. By the end of October of the 42nd year of the Republic of China [1953], both principal and interest will be fully cleared. The aforementioned lottery will be held annually in April and October, with payments commencing at the end of each month. Article 6: Bond tickets drawn in the lottery must be redeemed within six years, and interest coupons must be redeemed within three years. Overdue payments will not be honored. Article 7: The Shanghai Municipal Government will designate the city's dockage fees as the principal and interest repayment fund for these public bonds and will deposit funds in designated banks in installments according to the amounts specified in the principal and interest repayment schedule to cover the principal and interest due. Article 8: The face value of these public bonds will be fixed at 1,000 yuan and 100 yuan. Article 9: These public bonds are designated as unregistered. Article 10: These public bonds may be freely mortgaged and sold and may be used as security deposits or collateral for municipal government affairs, as well as funds or reserves for municipal public organizations and institutions. Matured principal and interest coupons may be used for the payment of municipal taxes. Article 11: The management of principal and interest repayment for these public bonds may be entrusted to banks. The municipal government will pay the bank managing the principal and interest repayment a handling fee of 0.25% of the payment amount annually. Article 12: Any acts of counterfeiting or undermining the credit of these public bonds will be punished by the judicial authorities according to law. Article 13: These regulations will take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>Over a Thousand Women and Children from Jiangwan Continued to Petition the Municipal Committee Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Relief Association Decided on a Method for Distributing Relief Funds Yesterday</p>
<p>Hundreds of women and children from various rural areas in Jiangwan gathered in front of the Jiangwan Municipal Committee Office the day before yesterday to demand the allocation of relief funds for disaster victims. (Photo by Li Zuntang)</p>
<p>The funds were explained to them by Municipal Committee members Wu Xuen and others, but to no avail. Therefore, starting from 8:00 AM yesterday, they continued to go to the office to petition, reaching over a thousand people. After explanations until 3:00 PM, they began to disperse. A portion of the women and children even went to the home of Municipal Committee member Wu Xuen and shouted, but they also dispersed soon after. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Security Team, and the Defense Corps, upon receiving the news, immediately dispatched teams to maintain order. As the order was relatively good, no accidents occurred. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Original Relief Plan</h3>
<p>After the end of the Shanghai War, disaster victims in the war zone were in urgent need of rescue. Therefore, the Local Maintenance Association raised 600,000 yuan, with 300,000 yuan used as a慰劳 for the 19th Route Army and an additional 300,000 yuan divided into 150,000 yuan for the relief of disaster victims in Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan, and other districts, and 150,000 yuan for the relief of disaster victims in the Shanghai municipal area. The relief funds for the Jiangwan district totaled over 50,000 yuan, with 25,000 yuan designated as building capital and 3,000 yuan as loan capital for the poor. The so-called building capital would be allocated based on receipts, and the remainder would be used for the construction of memorial villages for the淞沪 War. The construction plan included building one village in each of the four rural areas of Jiangwan Town to provide housing for disaster victims who had nowhere to live. One village had already been built near Gaojing Temple, with 130 civilian houses. However, the farmers there, who had always lived scattered for the convenience of耕种, found it inconvenient to live in a village and were unwilling to live there, requesting that housing be built at convenient locations. It is said that over 1,800 households, totaling over 8,000 rooms, were destroyed in the four rural areas of Jiangwan.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Petition</h3>
<p>On the 31st of last month, women and children from the district went to the Municipal Committee Office to petition, but as they did not receive a satisfactory response, they declared that they would stage a larger-scale petition on the 3rd. Therefore, starting from around 8:00 AM yesterday, they successively went to the office to願, totaling over a thousand people. The voices were loud, and the situation was serious. Municipal Committee members Wu Xuen and Yan Enzu came out to explain, saying that the disaster victims were anxiously awaiting relief and were relying on them. However, they did not understand and甚至责骂 the Municipal Committee members for embezzling funds. Although the number of people was large, there were no越轨 acts. Around 3:00 PM, they began to disperse, but another group of petitioning women and children went to the home of Municipal Committee member Wu Xuen and protested, but they also dispersed soon after. Before leaving, they demanded a response by the 13th of this month.</p>
<h3>Police Dispatched to the Scene to Suppress</h3>
<p>Upon receiving the news, the Municipal Security Office immediately dispatched the 8th company commander of the 2nd regiment of the 1st Security Team, Yan Hefu, along with two squads of the Security Team, totaling 80 men, to maintain order. At the same time, the Municipal Public Security Bureau also dispatched inspector Guo Lai, Dai Souen, the chief of the 5th section of the 5th district, and Li Lanxin, an officer, leading over 20 police officers, to the scene to suppress. The local Defense Corps also dispatched防, and the 7th District Party Department also sent幹事 Zhong Mian and 善章 to the scene to investigate.</p>
<h3>Relief Standards Determined</h3>
<p>The reason for the乡民's petition was that the 25,000 yuan allocated for building capital had to be issued based on housing deeds. The 乡民s believed that this办法 was unsuitable and requested that houses be built on the spot. Therefore, the Jiangwan Municipal Committee members gathered the night before to商变办法 and decided to函请 the War Zone Relief Committee to核办 40,000. That is: 1) Those who are孤苦 and without family property, 2) Those who are年老 and耕种无幼辈帮忙, 3) Those who are因战事而残废无力谋生, 4) Complete tenant farmers. Those who meet one of the above four items are eligible for relief. Therefore, when the乡氏 went to the bureau to petition yesterday, they immediately ordered the乡民s to按戸记 and summoned the 地保s to investigate the actual situation of the poor in each village within a time limit in order to proceed.</p>
<h3>Request to Change the Use of Funds by Letter</h3>
<p>The Jiangwan Fire Brigade, the Defense Corps, the Education Association, the Disaster Victims' Union, the Jiangwan Municipal Committee Office, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Jiang Disaster Office, and other organizations of the Seventh District Party Department sent a letter to the Shanghai War Zone Relief Committee, stating: "We hereby inform you that the乡民s of the four rural areas in this district are gathering and requesting息地建屋. The situation is serious and difficult to cope with. On the afternoon of the 2nd, we convened various闽 organizations to discuss relief measures. It was unanimously agreed that the要点 of the disaster victims' requests was nothing more than坚持散建. In addition to requesting the Local Maintenance Association to allocate funds, all the funds allocated to this district by your committee for building should be批准准予 to change the use of funds for the needs of就地建屋 as a means of providing immediate relief. The meeting also drafted樣准 to be issued by the Municipal Office to各图保 immediately, setting a deadline to查 the number of the poorest households in order to distribute funds. We respectfully submit this会衔函选希望 for your approval. Sincerely, Shanghai War Zone Relief Committee."</p>
<h3>Relief Group Held a Meeting Yesterday</h3>

The attendees were Tang Chengzong, Hong Lan, Wang Binyan, Wang Yiting, Lin Zainan, Zhang Binghui, Wu Xuen, Zhu Jiajun, Zhou Nianzu, Wang Zenghu, and others, totaling ten people.

Then, they discussed how to handle the unrest among the乡民s of Jiangwan. It was decided that 25,000 yuan would first be allocated from the funds designated by the跑方 Maintenance Association for the relief of the Jiangwan district to be distributed to each鄉户. The remaining funds would be decided on for a separate loan method.</p>
<h3>Erecting Monuments to Commemorate the Fallen Employees of Two Railways</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>Colleagues from the Jinghu, Huhangyong, and Lianglu railways collectively raised funds to manufacture copper memorial monuments, both large and small, to commemorate the fallen employees. These monuments were placed at various stations along the Jinghu Railway. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a memorial ceremony was held simultaneously at each station. All 200 employees at the North Station participated.</p>
<h3>Erecting Monuments for Commemoration</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a colorful archway was erected at the entrance of the North Station, with the national flag of the party and the state hung high. On the wall to the left, a temporary portrait of the General Manager and the national flag of the party and the state were hung. On the wall to the right, the monument was erected, with the words "Spirits Never Die" written in white cloth at the top. On both sides hung elegiac couplets from colleagues from the two railways. The monument was made of copper, four feet long and three feet wide, with a circular Blue Sky White Sun pattern cast on the top, and the inscription read: "Memorial Monument to the Fallen Employees of the Lianglu Railways. This year's January 28th incident. Employees of the Lianglu Railways martyred their lives. Remembering the former glory, the posthumous regret increases. Funding was donated to erect a monument at the site of their martyrdom. A general monument was erected at the Jinghu and Lianglu stations to not forget." The names of the martyred colleagues are listed on the left: Station Master Ji Youqing, Xu Bin, Officer Wang Jingxian, Ye Keqing, Zhang Jinyi, and husband Xue Sanlang, Zhu Yonglin, Gao Shaoquan, Zhang Shengrong, Zhang Wenkui, Xuan Jinda, Fan Hongsheng, Zhang Wenhua, Zhou Rongfu, Respectfully erected by colleagues from the Jinghu, Huhangyong, and Lianglu railways on November 3rd of the 21st year of the Republic of China. The Pioneer Corps of the Rotary Elementary School maintained order inside the premises. (Photo by Xu Tianzhang)</p>
<h3>Ceremony Details</h3>
<p>The ceremony was conducted with due formality. First, Chairman Zheng Binzhao briefly reported on the history of the martyred heroes and the circumstances of their deaths. Then, music was played to consecrate the memorial. Subsequently, the directors of the two railways and the head of the Traffic Department presented wreaths and delivered speeches, saying: (Today, we are holding the consecration ceremony for the memorial to the martyred employees of the Traffic Departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. This is to commemorate all those who sacrificed their lives during the January 28th Incident. We recall that on the evening of January 28th, when the Shanghai North Station was attacked by the enemy, more than a hundred of our colleagues gathered together spontaneously and worked hard for the country and the railways until their deaths. What was the reason for this? It was to find a way out for the nation, to fight for the survival of the weak, and for the integrity of our Republic of China's territory. The 19th Route Army resisted on the front lines, while our railway colleagues did commendable and moving work by obstructing the enemy's transportation and facilitating our army's movements. Although the deaths of our colleagues were so tragic this time, their loyal, courageous, and heroic spirit will last forever. Everyone knows that this heroic spirit was not for personal gain, but to fully fulfill the responsibilities of citizens and railway employees. Therefore, although their physical bodies have been destroyed, their spirit will never die. This valuable sacrifice is worthy of being a model for the employees of this railway and a loyal and courageous guide for them. It is hoped that everyone can inherit the legacy of the martyrs and continue to work hard to carry out the great will of our martyrs' fearless sacrifice. Only then will we not fail the heroic actions of the martyrs and comfort their spirits in heaven. Only then will this consecration ceremony today be more valuable and more meaningful.) Furthermore, Zou Zhengjian, representative of the party branches of the two railways, and the heads of the locomotive, traffic, and engineering departments delivered speeches. Finally, Ji Wenlie, representative of the families, gave a reply. A photograph was taken to mark the occasion.</p>
<h3>Situation at Various Stations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at 10:00 AM, memorial services were held at the Zhenru, Nanxiang, Shishan Road, Tiantong'an, Zhanghuabang, Yunbang, and Huaxin stations. Representatives from the party branches and labor unions of the two railways were dispatched to participate in the ceremonies at each station.</p>
<h3>Geng Chongde Telegraphed War Situation</h3>

Geng Jizhou personally led more than 3,000 of his troops to attack Jinzhou, engaging in fierce fighting with more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers for several hours. The Japanese army sent armored vehicles and reinforcements of over 700 men to launch a general attack on us. At that time, Xie Zhenguo's Sixth Detachment of over 2,000 men went to assist and launched a fierce attack together. After another two hours of fighting, the Japanese army sent several planes to bomb us and strafe us with machine guns. Our army shot down two planes and killed over 200 enemy soldiers. Our side lost one battalion commander and 30 soldiers. The fighting is still ongoing. Brother Geng Chongde.</p>
<p>Another telegram said: (Omitted above).

<h3>Two Englishmen Accidentally Injured Pinghu Villagers, Brought to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲The Martin Brothers</p>
<p>▲Immediately Handed Over to the British Consulate</p>
<p>▲The Municipal Government Forwarded Zhejiang Telegrams</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that two British employees of the Asiatic Petroleum Company in this city, the Martin brothers, accidentally injured Fei Jinkui and Zhou Pan, a man and a woman, while hunting in Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province. They were seized by the villagers and temporarily placed under the custody of the county government. The previous reports have already mentioned these details. It is now known that after the British Consul-General in this city received a telegram from Pinghu regarding the Martins, he immediately dispatched Vice-Consul Kidson to meet and receive them. He also requested the Municipal Government to send a letter to the county government, asking them to hand over the Martin brothers to Kidson to be brought to Shanghai for interrogation. After the Municipal Government approved the letter, it sent separate letters to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Pinghu County Government for review and handling. It received a reply from the Zhejiang Provincial Government the day before yesterday, stating in brief that it had informed Pinghu County Magistrate Wu to send the Englishmen, the Martin brothers, to the Municipal Government to be handed over to the British Consulate in Shanghai. It also requested the Municipal Government to declare on behalf of the victims, Fei Jinkui and Zhou Pan, that they reserved all rights. The Municipal Government immediately forwarded the telegram to the British Consul-General for verification. Last night at 5:00 PM, Yan Shenfu, a patrol officer from the Public Security Bureau of Pinghu County, Huang Sisong, a judicial police chief, and Yang Hanzhao and Sun Lanfang, judicial police officers, accompanied British Vice-Consul Kidson to bring the Martin brothers to the Municipal Government. The British Vice-Consul immediately applied to Mayor Wu to transfer them to the consulate. According to Yan Shenfu, the patrol officer from the Public Security Bureau of Pinghu County who escorted the Martin brothers to Shanghai, the villagers Fei Jinkui and Zhou Pan were only slightly injured and would recover soon. He and the others would return to the county tomorrow (i.e., today) to report for duty. The Shanghai Times reports that yesterday (the 2nd), according to a telegram from Vice-Consul Kidson, the two men were treated very well by the local officials in Pinghu.</p>
<h3>Update on the Volunteer Army Relief Effort Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Telegraph to Jiang Bocheng in Beiping for Assistance</p>
<p>▲Patriotic Boy Insistently Requests to Enlist</p>
<p>Since the first team of the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Team from this city departed for the north, the office has been actively preparing for the departure of the second batch of team members. In recent days, many people have been enthusiastically registering and donating funds. The following is a record of yesterday's news:</p>
<h3>Telegraph to Jiang Bocheng in Beiping</h3>
<p>The team's office telegraphed Jiang Bocheng in Beiping, requesting assistance for the first batch of relief workers upon their arrival in Beiping. The original telegram stated: "To Jiang Commissioner Bocheng of Beiping, considering that the Northeast Volunteer Army is determined to resist with unwavering resolve, risking flesh and blood in a desperate battle with the invaders, and although the Volunteer Army is brave, it is still vulnerable to injury, our team has gathered patriotic individuals from all walks of life to organize the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Team, which departed from Shanghai on the tenth day of the previous month to carry out relief work in the war zone. We know that the Commissioner is enthusiastic about patriotism and charity. We hereby send this telegram respectfully requesting you to find ways to assist and provide guidance as needed. The Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Team, Shanghai Office, Fei Jian, Wu Huiquan, respectfully."</p>
<h3>Boy Insistently Requests to Enlist</h3>
<p>The team received a letter yesterday from Chen Yisheng of Lao Gong Cang Foreign Firm, which stated: (Omitted above). "My son, Xiaoqian, who knows how to read, is extremely indignant after reading the newspapers every day. He went to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association on Guling Road to request an introduction to go out and fight the enemy, but to no avail. That night, he took Lysol disinfectant in an attempt to end his life. Fortunately, his family noticed early and called a doctor in time to save his life. After repeated persuasion, he is waiting for the opportunity to serve the country again. Now that he knows that your team is actually departing to take on the relief of the Northeast fighting Volunteer Army, my son, Xiaoqian, came to register and meet with the comrades of your team. According to them, he has no medical experience and was politely rejected. Who knew that after returning home, he still wanted to take poison for the second time. If he is not allowed to depart, his life and future are at risk. Moreover, he has long held this intention to serve the country. Therefore, I am willing to disregard his youth and separation from his family, and I especially recommend him and request that you allow him to be assigned to the second batch for departure to fulfill his wishes. I would like to come forward to ask, but due to working on ships, I have very little free time. Therefore, I specifically write this letter of recommendation, requesting permission to join. I would be extremely grateful. Sincerely, Chen Yisheng of Lao Gong Mao Foreign Firm on Guangdong Road, this city, to the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Team." After receiving the letter, the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Team sent personnel to investigate at the firm. Because the boy's patriotic ambition was commendable, they have allowed him to join the team. He went to the team yesterday to practice, waiting to depart with the second batch.</p>
<h3>Chinese Employees of Butterfield &amp; Swire Initiate Monthly Donations to Aid the Volunteer Army</h3>

<h3>Whereabouts of Contemporary Figures</h3>
<p>▲Xu Yongchang arrived in Shanghai last night, taking the 6:00 PM night express from Hangzhou.</p>
<p>▲Chen Shaokuan and Liu Chongjie took the night train to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>German Ambassador Todtmann Returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou</h3>
<p>▲Scheduled to Visit Chen Gongbo This Morning</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that German Ambassador to China Todtmann returned to Shanghai the night before last after visiting Hangzhou and stayed at the German Consulate General. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him yesterday morning, but he was out. According to consulate personnel, the Ambassador plans to stay in Shanghai for a week before heading north again. Trade between China and Germany has increased this year compared to last year, but Chinese goods exported to Germany are more than German goods exported to China. It is also understood that the Ambassador is scheduled to meet with Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo this morning to discuss matters related to the steel mill.</p>
<h3>Swedish Consul General in Shanghai, Lagerfelt, Promoted to Chargé d'Affaires to China</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Geneva, 2nd: The Swiss Federal Administrative Committee has changed the title of the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai to Chargé d'Affaires. This is the beginning of Switzerland's diplomatic representation in China. The Geneva Daily News, describing this matter, stated: "The proper solution would be to establish an embassy in China and send a plenipotentiary minister, but in fact, this is very difficult to implement because the establishment of an embassy is very costly, and the federal budget must be kept economical. Now, changing the duties of the Consul General to Chargé d'Affaires means that there is someone in charge of diplomatic affairs, and it does not hinder the federal finances. This is a win-win situation. The first Chargé d'Affaires of Switzerland to China, promoted from the Consul General in Shanghai, is Lagerfelt. His father was a member of the Nushad family and served as the Swiss representative in Paris for thirty-four years. His brother headed the Swiss Legation in Tokyo for four years and was later appointed as the Minister to Sweden. Lagerfelt has been in the diplomatic service for a long time and has traveled to almost every famous city in the world. He was promoted to Counsellor of the Embassy and finally transferred from the Embassy in Washington to Shanghai to succeed the former Consul General Isler. From this point of view, Lagerfelt's origin in the diplomatic field is solid."</p>
<p>Relations between China and Switzerland began in the 18th century, when watchmakers in Valtraverne specialized in making watches for export to China. At the same time, the British East India Company shipped precious artifacts, lacquerware, and ivory goods to Switzerland. Even today, old homes in Geneva still treasure these items. In the 19th century, silk fabrics were imported from China and were appreciated by upper-class women. This is the past relationship between the two countries. Currently, there are several hundred Swiss residents in China, mostly engaged in business. Among the merchants, there are quite a few who hold important positions, mostly centered in Shanghai. Switzerland initially had no consulate, but as the number of Swiss residents increased, it first established a formal commercial office in Shanghai between 1911 and 1914, followed by a consulate. In addition to material interests, Switzerland also has religious interests in China. The Basel Protestant Church has branches in China. Now, in China, where the local situation is unstable and bandits are rampant in several provinces, it is of great importance for Swiss representatives to exercise their authority to protect Swiss missionaries.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Petition Representatives to Enter Beijing Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>▲Petitioning Various Yuan and Ministries Separately</p>
<p>▲National Federation of Commerce and Industry Submits a Petition Requesting Negotiation</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Huang An and Xu Bianxian, the representatives dispatched by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in South Vietnam to return to the country to petition, have been quite busy contacting various parties. Huang and others stated that their work in Shanghai has been completed and they are scheduled to take the train to Beijing tomorrow night to separately petition the various Yuan and ministries of the central government. The National Federation of Commerce and Industry has prepared a petition and entrusted it to Huang and Xu to present. The original petition is recorded as follows: "Presenting on the matter of the old Sino-French Treaty of Commerce having been abolished, the new treaty not yet implemented, Chinese overseas are treated harshly in Vietnam, and suffering is immense. Representatives have been dispatched to return to the country, requesting negotiations with France for the swift implementation of the new treaty to alleviate the difficulties of overseas Chinese. On November 1 of this year, we received a letter from Huang An, a representative of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in South Vietnam, which stated briefly: 'The old treaty was originally followed for Chinese merchants doing business in Vietnam. Since the abolition of the old treaty in May 1930 and the revision of the new treaty, the French government has not yet implemented it. In the meantime, the overseas Chinese merchants in Vietnam are in the position of people of an untreatied country and are taxed according to ordinary tax rules. It has been found that the Sino-French Vietnamese old treaty gave our country special tariff preferential benefits. In recent years, it has been treated with ordinary tax rules, and the tax rate has suddenly increased by 10%. The business has been extremely difficult. In addition, at a time when the Vietnamese economy is low and the commercial markets are increasingly bleak, the failure of Chinese merchants has become inevitable. Furthermore, with the implementation of the Most Favored Nation Treaty between Japan and Vietnam in August of this year, there is a great difference between it and ordinary tax rules. As a result, our goods can no longer gain a foothold in Vietnam. Our association has routinely decided to dispatch advisor Huang An as a representative to return to the country to seek government rescue to negotiate with France for the implementation of the new treaty. We have long admired your association's leadership of the merchants, whose weal and woe are related. We hereby send this letter requesting a transfer of assistance, etc.' Upon approval, an investigation found that the Sino-French Treaty of Commerce was signed on May 16, 1930, by our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the French Minister to China."</p>
<p>"At that time, although our country had promulgated it, the French government has not yet implemented it, and our country has not continued to negotiate. As a result, for several years, the Chinese overseas in Vietnam have suffered this harsh tax treatment and immense hardship. In light of the foregoing, we hereby present this to your esteemed government departments for examination and approval. We earnestly request that you quickly negotiate with the French government to implement the Sino-French Treaty of Commerce within the shortest period of time, and quickly dispatch consuls to various places to effectively urge the cancellation of the ungrounded harsh taxes to alleviate the difficulties of overseas Chinese. This is for public benefit. In addition to separately presenting to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we respectfully present this."</p>
<h3>Muslim Representative Ma Xingdong Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Talked About the Success of the Petition to the Executive Yuan in Beijing</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Ma Xingdong, Da Pusheng, Mu Huating, Wu Yongjin, and other four representatives were previously dispatched by Muslims in this city to Beijing to petition the Executive Yuan. Representative Ma returned to Shanghai first yesterday and attended the standing committee of the Shanghai Muslim Mosque Association at 7:00 PM last night to report on the process of petitioning in Beijing. According to Representative Ma's remarks to a Central News Agency reporter, this trip to Beijing was a joint petition to the Executive Yuan with representatives of the North China Muslim Protection Association. The Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Chu Minyi, received them and held a total of two meetings. The Shanghai representatives requested two points: First, order the Shanghai Municipal Government to seal up the Beixin Bookstore, which insulted Islam, and punish the author of "Little Pig Bajie." Second, issue a circular to the national publishing industry that it must not publish insulting religious texts in the future. The North China representatives requested three points: First, order the suspension of Nanhua Literature and Art Magazine. Second, punish Zeng Zhongming, the editor-in-chief of Nanhua. Third, punish Lou Zikuang, the author of "Why Muslims Don't Eat Pork." Secretary-General Chu promised to accept each point of the request and promised to provide a concrete reply by a set date. Therefore, the result of this petition in Beijing can be considered satisfactory. Currently, Da Pusheng, Mu Huating, Wu Yongxia, and other three representatives are still staying in Beijing, waiting for Secretary-General Chu's reply. The speaker himself returned to Shanghai first to report.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Replied to the Chamber of Commerce: Protested the Increase in Burmese Taxes</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the Burmese government's increase in import taxes on Chinese goods was contrary to the Sino-British Reciprocal Tariff Treaty, and requested that the ministry negotiate on reasonable grounds. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, with the original text stating: "Having learned of the telegram from the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, we have been informed of the Burmese government's tax increase by Consul Xu, stationed in Yangon. We have telegraphed and ordered that a protest be lodged based on the treaty. As for the proposal to maintain a reduced tax system for land trade along the Yunnan border, given the occupation of the customs in the Northeast and the impact on tariff policy, it cannot be implemented. This is a special reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, World Seal."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Denies that the Steel Plant is a Sino-German Joint Venture</h3>
<p>Regarding the Ministry of Industry's contract with the German firm GHH Machine Works, a representative of the Ministry of Industry stated yesterday that the contract is expected to be signed around the end of this month. The proposed steel plant is entirely operated by the Ministry of Industry and is not a Sino-German joint venture. The Ministry of Industry handed over 40 million in national treasury bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance to the company as collateral. After receiving these national treasury bonds, the company will ship machinery worth 10 million US dollars to China. GHH Machine Works suggested that the steel plant be located in Xiejiadian, near Pukou, because the company is a creditor and its suggestions regarding the plant site are based on transportation convenience. However, the Ministry of Industry believes that it must comply with military defense. Whether Ma'anshan is immune to military invasion needs to be carefully inspected by military authorities before a decision can be made. As for the repayment period, it is generally seven years and may be subject to change before signing. The interest rate is not yet known, but it is also very low.</p>

<h3>Nanjing Road Citizens Continue to Strive Against Telephone Rate Hikes</h3>
<p>▲ The Municipal Council Should Eliminate Preconceived Notions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Citizens' Association have repeatedly written to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Municipal Council and all public associations in the city to continue opposing telephone rate hikes, as reported in various newspapers. It is understood that the association is making unremitting efforts. Yesterday, it also sent an urgent telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Industry of the National Government in Nanjing, stating: "The National Government of Nanjing, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Industry: The Shanghai Telephone Company was first approved by the Municipal Council of the First Special District, and then agreed upon by the Public Works Bureau of the Second Special District, raising the telephone usage fee for residences from 52 taels of silver to 65 taels, and for businesses from 78 taels of silver to 105 taels. Each call was increased from 5 cents of small money to 4 cents of silver, retroactive to March 27 of this year. While we recognize that the telephone company may inevitably use coercive and intimidating tactics, such as cutting lines, to gain the approval of the local authorities in the district, we have not achieved the goal of canceling the rate increase and making it retroactive. However, we will never abandon our interests and submit this unjust act and high-handed means to the judgment of world opinion. The telephone is a public utility. On the one hand, it obtains a patent, and on the other hand, its capital is consolidated through the fee. Therefore, its usage fee should be lower than that of a business without a patent. An investigation reveals that the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States this year is 2.5%, the Bank of England is 2%, and the interest rate on Chinese government bonds is 6%. The interest rates on the debentures of the Shanghai Power Company and the Shanghai Telephone Company are both 6%. We do not know why the municipal authorities in the district approved the Shanghai Telephone Company's revenue to be 8%, plus an additional 1%, totaling 9%, thereby increasing the burden on users. The Municipal Council, which first approved this measure, has failed in its responsibility to those it represents. Even if we concede that this telephone rate increase is bound by the contract signed between the Municipal Council and the Shanghai Telephone Company on August 5, 1930, the price increase must be based on the Aesop report. The contract does not stipulate that it can be based on the unreasonable 10% interest. An investigation reveals that the Shanghai Telephone Company's invested capital and installed lines amount to several tens of thousands of users, and the number of users is assumed to be 30,000, while the former is 100,000. Then, the capital used for the 70,000 unused lines is the company's miscalculation and self-stagnation, which has nothing to do with the users. It is incomprehensible why the Municipal Council must force the users to bear the profits of the capital stagnated due to the company's miscalculation. The most unfair aspect of this matter is the utmost effort to exempt the telephone company from fulfilling its contractual obligations and to protect its rights, while ignoring the economic decline suffered by the taxpayers it represents after the Japanese disturbances in Shanghai, refusing to exempt them from their forced obligations and protect their right to low fees. This is a dereliction of duty by the Director-General of the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council Gazette of October 21 of this year published a letter from Anson to Jones, the Director-General of the Public Concession, regarding his opinions on the telephone rate increase. From the meaning of the third paragraph of Anson's letter, Anson has already realized that he cannot escape the judgment of public opinion and admits that his opinions did not take into account the economic changes during this period. He also said that if he were asked to come to China for investigation again, he would definitely have another report to suppress our hopes. This proves that Anson himself admits that the previous report could not take into account the interests of the majority of the masses, which led to the gentry dispute. Therefore, the Public Concession Municipal Council should eliminate its prejudices, take responsibility, negotiate with the company to cancel the new price and compensate for it, and set a fair price after obtaining the consent of the users, so as to resolve the gentry dispute and achieve a peaceful solution. We also earnestly request and compel the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to submit a serious protest to the diplomatic missions, seeking a fair solution that takes into account the interests of both parties. We are infinitely hopeful and respectful. The Shanghai First District Citizens' Association and the Nanjing Road Business Association respectfully salute."</p>

<h3>A Patrolman Shot Dead in Front of the Yongyu Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>▲ An Argument Suddenly Erupted During the Inspection of Female Workers Leaving Work</p>
<p>▲ Workers Gathered, and the Patrolman Was Fatally Shot</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, at around 6:20, an argument occurred between female workers and a patrolman in front of the Yongyu Yarn Factory at No. 29 Guangfu Road, Xiaoshaduhe, Shanghai West, which escalated into a shooting resulting in death. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Incident Triggered by Inspection of Female Workers</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, at 5:20, as the female workers of the factory's night shift were leaving work, a female worker named Zhang Wang, 31 years old from Yancheng, had just left the factory gate. Patrolman Ren Yuanshun, who was guarding the factory entrance to prevent concealed items from being taken out, went forward to search her. Ms. Zhang refused, and the two sides got into an argument. Ms. Zhang grabbed Ren Yuanshun and accused him of deliberately making things difficult and intentionally harassing her. Therefore, Ren slapped her face. The two sides then engaged in a physical altercation. After another patrolman nearby mediated, Ms. Zhang was persuaded to leave the factory. However, Ms. Zhang sat at the factory gate, crying and scolding loudly. At around 6:10, when the male workers of the factory's night shift were leaving work, Ms. Zhang's cousins, Fu Rusong and Fu Rugao, from Yancheng, came out and asked her what happened. They went to Ren to reason with him. However, after a disagreement, Fu Rugao was tied up and beaten by Ren. Seeing this, his brother Fu Rusong took the opportunity to run away. Ren Yuanshun chased after him, and when he was about to reach the factory gate, he was caught up by Ren, and the two wrestled together at the gate. At the same time, male and female workers gathered at the factory gate and did not disperse.</p>
<p>▲ Patrolman Shot Dead</p>
<p>While the two sides were arguing, two patrolmen, Chen Huahai and Lou Qihuo, saw Ren Yuanshun surrounded by the crowd and went forward to disperse them. Suddenly, a shot rang out from the crowd, and patrolman Chen Huahai was shot and fell to the ground. Another patrolman, Zhang Zhoumu, seeing that Chen was injured, fired a shot into the air. The crowd dispersed in shock and arrested Fu Rugao, 34, Fu Rusong, 27, and Zhang Wang. At that time, Hu Lizhong, the police chief of the branch of the Second Detachment of the police stationed there and the Sixth District Police Station, rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. He first arrested the three and sent them to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau to report. Chen Huahai was shot by a bullet that entered his face and did not come out. He was immediately taken by car to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. However, due to his serious injuries, he was dying. After the doctor's examination, just as he was about to find a way to remove the bullet, he died at 10:30. The Sixth District Public Security Bureau immediately ordered Xu Yunchu, the local guarantor of the area, to report to the local court for an autopsy.</p>
<p>▲ Investigation into Who Fired the Shot</p>
<p>After the incident, Hu Lizhong, the police chief of the Guangfu Road Police Station in the Sixth District, went to the factory to investigate who fired the shot. According to Wang Jinliang, the factory's patrol leader, he only heard a gunshot, and Chen was injured and fell to the ground. He did not know who fired the shot. Patrolman Zhang Zhoumu said that he fired a shot into the air because he saw Chen fall to the ground. However, according to people nearby, two gunshots were heard. However, it was unlikely that any of the workers had a gun, and it was feared that it was fired by Ren Yuanshun when he was surrounded or that Chen accidentally shot himself. After Hu, the police chief, inquired, he took both Brown Lin pistols worn by Ren and Chen to the district, along with Zhang Wang and others, and transferred them to the Sixth District Office. After the director of the office interrogated them, he prepared a document to report to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Umbrella Industry Establishes National Products Promotion Branch</h3>
<p>The Umbrella Industry Association, in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, established the Umbrella Industry Branch of the National Products Promotion Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce at its meeting place at Peidel 里, Jijia Lane, in the city at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. In addition to the attendance of all committee members, members of various factories also attended in full. The meeting proceeded as follows: (A) Report Matters Chairman Zhao Tianmin reported that the national product umbrella originated in the fifth year of the Republic of China. Although the achievements over the past ten years have not been worth mentioning, they have benefited the livelihood of workers and recovered rights and interests. It is gratifying that the raw materials for domestic umbrellas have now been successfully produced. This is indeed a major threat to imperialist economic aggression. However, the ambition of imperialism has not ended, and it is now intensifying its dumping policy to attack our country, hoping to wipe out our national products in one fell swoop and then raise prices to dominate the market. This kind of large-scale economic aggression is enough to destroy our country and cannot be feared! Now, the Association follows the orders of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to establish a National Products Promotion Branch. It is hoped that colleagues will work hard together to seek survival, abandon jealousy, and do their best to create national products so that foreign goods will disappear from the market in order to defeat the ambition of imperialist economic aggression. I am willing to encourage all colleagues to work together. (B) Discussion Matters Member Jin Dichen proposed that the Association must earnestly promote national products and not engage in empty talk. It must first pay attention to investigation, inspection, research, and other matters in accordance with the charter of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Please draft a plan (Decision) The above matters are broad and cannot be handled immediately. Submit them to the Executive Committee for detailed consideration and handling. Committee member Zhu Chunbo proposed that the branch should hire a general manager who has research experience and familiarity with the raw materials of various factories to be responsible for all matters related to promoting and contacting national product raw materials. Is this appropriate? Please decide (Decision) The committee will hire Lin Husheng as the general manager of the branch. (C) Organizational Situation 1. Zhao Tianmin, chairman of the Umbrella Industry Association, will be the director of the branch. 2. All committee members of the Umbrella Industry Association will be the committee members. 3. The representatives of the members of the Umbrella Industry Association will be the members. (D) Matters to be Handled 1. Matters related to the inspection of colleagues. 2. Matters related to the investigation of colleagues. 3. Matters related to the publicity of colleagues. 4. Matters related to the research of colleagues. Li Ruzhang, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech, saying that the promotion of national products should first focus on publicity, followed by the establishment of raw material factories with capital in order to ensure sufficient domestic raw materials so as not to rely on foreign goods. It is most appropriate for colleagues to enthusiastically adopt domestic raw materials, unify prices, eliminate infighting, and unite and help each other. If this continues, it will definitely achieve satisfactory results. Moreover, the manufacture of national products is in its infancy. The promotion is not a one-day or one-night effort. It must be done with perseverance. If it is not completed in one year, it will take two or three years to achieve complete adoption of national products. As the saying goes, "Where there is a will, there is a way." Therefore, it is hoped that your association will be dedicated to promoting national products. The inspection team of the former enemy goods was first established by your association, and the National Products Promotion Branch was also first established. It is hoped that you will do it earnestly in the future, and do not be superficial, and do not betray the high expectations of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. This is what I hope to hear from you.</p>
<h3>The Reality of Japanese Coal Dumping in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ The Kailuan Coal is Greatly Affected</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese coal in our country's market, in order to regain its original sales channels before (September 18 Incident), has repeatedly reduced the price of Fushun, Yuanshan, Kamida, and Ikeno coal, engaging in large-scale dumping in order to disturb the current coal market and harm our country's economy. In order to make the people of our country thoroughly understand the reality of Japanese coal dumping, the findings from various investigations are disclosed below. ▲ Japanese Coal Prices Plummet Again and Again</p>
<p>The price of Fushun coal from Dalian to Shanghai is 10 taels and 6 qian. After deducting the freight of 1 tael and 3.5 qian, the dock fee of 6 qian, and the commission of at least 5 qian, the actual price per ton is only 8 taels and 1 qian. The price of Ikeno coal is only 4 taels now, and after deducting the three items of freight, etc., only 1 tael and 5 qian remains. The other ten or so types of coal, such as Yuanshan and Kamida, are similar to Ikeno. Who would believe that this is not dumping?</p>
<p>▲ Kailuan Coal is Greatly Affected</p>
<p>A reporter from Shen Times News visited the Kailuan Coal Mine Company yesterday for an on-the-spot investigation. According to an important official of the company, Kailuan No. 2 fines were still sold for 10 taels and 7.5 qian on January 7 of this year. Now, due to the dumping of Fushun and Japanese coal, the price has gradually decreased to 6 taels and 5 qian. The inventory in various places is as follows: Qinhuangdao has more than 600,000 tons, Hankou has more than 130,000 tons, and the area below Wuhu has about 150,000 tons, totaling about one million tons. Outsiders who do not understand the situation say that Kailuan lacks vehicles and cannot transport enough coal. However, the company has returned 200 of the original 600 coal transport vehicles to the railway bureau since it was affected by dumping.</p>
<p>▲ Comparison of Coal Shipping Costs</p>
<p>Some say that the freight rate is too expensive, causing Chinese coal to be unsalable. However, according to the reporter's investigation, the results are quite different from what is rumored. The freight rates for Kailuan and other types of coal are as follows: Kailuan · 0.01513 yuan, Zhongxing · 0.005 yuan, Jingxing · 0.00685 yuan, Liuhegou · 0.00825 yuan. The above freight rates are all calculated per ton per kilometer. Since the prices are reasonable, it is clear that the sluggish sales are still due to the dumping of Japanese coal. Moreover, no domestic coal, such as Changxing, is unaffected, with Kailuan being the most affected. If this continues, if our country does not urgently seek remedies, it will not only harm the coal industry, but also shake the country's economic position. The future is unimaginable.</p>
<h3>The Dispute at the Anlu Factory Was Declared Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ All Employees Receive Severance Pay</p>
<p>The Anlu Cotton Weaving Factory on Yuezhou Road, Hongkou, announced its closure in June of this year due to poor business performance. Its Nanjing Road retail department was also announced to be liquidated at the same time. Recently, the liquidation was completed, and the retail department also closed on the 30th of last month. All the employees of the factory petitioned to the party and government authorities for assistance because the company suddenly closed down without prior notice. It is learned that the factory and the employee representatives negotiated directly yesterday and reached an agreement that the company would pay each employee two months and ten days of salary as severance pay. The employees were satisfied and received the severance pay in full. The wages borrowed by the company from the employees in the past were also not deducted. Therefore, it has been declared a successful resolution.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Holds a Regular Memorial Service for Workers</h3>
<p>The water room of the gate engine room of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway suddenly exploded at 2:50 pm on the 24th of last month. Seven workers, including Zhao Ayou, Wang Changming, Shen Jinji, Shan Deming, Chen Yantang, and Zeng Ji, were killed on the spot. Hu Chuan died from ineffective treatment. In addition to collecting the bodies of the deceased, the department also took pity on the workers and decided to hold a memorial service for the fallen colleagues at 2:00 pm on the 6th of this month in the open space next to the gate station to express their condolences. In addition to the participation of all employees, the party headquarters and trade unions of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways were also invited to participate and express their condolences. It is learned that the two railways have appointed Director Chen Bohua and others to attend at that time.</p>
<h3>Chief Prosecutor of the District Court Changes</h3>
<p>Liu Maochu, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court, has been transferred to the Zhenjiang Local Court as the Chief Prosecutor by order of the Ministry of Justice. The position of Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court will be filled by Lou Ying, the Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangning Local Court. Lou Ying, the Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangning Local Court, has been transferred to the current local court to take over the position. The Prosecutor's Office of the current local court has prepared transfer procedures to facilitate the new Chief Prosecutor's assumption of office.</p>
<h3>Wang Aoxi, Jiao Daosong, and Song Are Detained</h3>
<p>Wang Aoxi and Jiao Daosong from Sichuan organized the Li Society, which attracted the attention of the authorities. Gan Weiqi was specially dispatched to Shanghai to investigate. After Gan arrived in Shanghai, he was appointed as an inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He was a classmate of Jiao at the Whampoa Military Academy, so he stayed at Jiao's house on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession in order to spy on Wang's whereabouts. He learned that Wang was hiding in Room 408 of the China Hotel on Guizhou Road in the Public Concession. He was about to apply to the police for assistance in arresting him. However, fearing that the news would leak, he did not request the court to issue an arrest warrant and went to the China Hotel that night. Jiao was in Wang's room, so they were arrested together and sent to the Lao Zha Police Station to explain the situation and request temporary detention. Meanwhile, the head of the police station sent Chinese and Western detectives to search Wang Aoxi and found many drafts written by him. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Wang and Jiao, along with various drafts, to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. Judge Zhao Zhengtang held a hearing. Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor specially appointed by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, attended the hearing to request a transfer. The police station lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated in court that since Wang Aoxi was a wanted criminal, the police station would agree to the request from the mainland authorities for a transfer. However, whether Jiao Daosong could be transferred together still needed to be considered. Judge Zhao interrogated Wang Aoxi, who stated that he had previously worked as an editor at the Nanjing Citizen's Daily and took over the New World News in September of last year, but it was banned from publication. The drafts found this time were all written by him and were intended to be sent by air to Sichuan Province for publication, etc. He also made extensive remarks on the current situation. Jiao Daosong stated that he was a current member of the Military Affairs Committee and left his position in July to come to Shanghai, but he had not resigned and had received his salary up to October. He and Wang were friends, and their opinions were the same. However, he had not written or published anything. Judge Zhao adjourned the court after questioning them. Wang and Jiao were temporarily detained. The court originally intended to continue the hearing in the afternoon, but since the police station had not yet made a definite decision on whether to prosecute, it was still considering it carefully. After the police station lawyer, Li Zhishan, went to court to request an extension for review, it was approved by President Yu, so the hearing was not continued in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>National Products Review Committee Begins Reviewing Products from Various Factories</h3>
<p>At the National Products Exhibition held last month, national products factories in the city added their products to the displays for public viewing and promotion. After the National Products Exhibition closed on the 24th of last month, a review committee was organized to review the products from various factories and add ratings, and certificates will be issued by Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Xingya, divided into four types: special grade, excellent grade, superior grade, and first grade. The committee convened a meeting of all review committee members the day before yesterday and began to review the products separately from the day before. It is estimated that the review process will take about four or five days. The reviewed goods will be returned to the original factories starting today. Once all the reviews are completed, a general meeting of all review committee members will be convened to make detailed judgments on the grades. At the same time, Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Xingya will be invited to the meeting to present awards.</p>
<h3>Bombing Incidents Occur at Two Shops</h3>
<p>▲ Only Broken Glass, Fortunately No One Was Injured</p>
<p>At 7:20 last night, a man dressed in a blue cloth short shirt, resembling a worker, suddenly threw a bomb at the entrance of Yufeng Yanghuo Store, which was opened by Xin Huasheng at 112 French Avenue in the French Concession. The bomb landed in the middle of the cement floor at the main entrance of the store and exploded with a deafening sound. Fortunately, no one was injured. Only one tree foot, two pieces of glass, and one light bulb were damaged. The patrol police on duty at the site rushed to the scene upon hearing the sound. However, due to the chaotic crowd, the bomber had already escaped. Afterwards, the manager of the store, together with the patrol police, took a bomb casing to the French Police Station at the Big Bell Tower to report the incident.</p>
<p>▲ At about 6:00 pm yesterday, in the Rongchangxiang Clock and Watch Store at No. 128 Fujian Road, the shop assistants were preparing dinner when a bomb suddenly landed on the glass counter in the shop hall. The glass of the counter was shattered, but the shop assistants were not injured. The shop assistants were alarmed and quickly reported to the Lao Zha Police Station. The police station immediately sent detectives to the scene to investigate and took the unexploded bomb back to the police station for storage. According to the store, they had not received any letters beforehand.</p>
<h3>Petition Regarding the National Products Exhibition</h3>
<p>▲ Request for Compensation for Fire Damage to Exhibition Site</p>
<p>The National Products Exhibition yesterday submitted a document to the Municipal Government, stating that the exhibition concluded on the 24th of last month. According to regulations, exhibitors were to remove their products within seven days to finalize the event. However, due to waiting for the Review Committee to assess and award prizes, the process was delayed until yesterday. During the committee's review, around noon to 1 PM, while the association was hosting the review committee members for lunch, a nearby construction project by a Mr. Yao involved setting off celebratory fireworks during the raising of a roof beam. These fireworks shot into the roof of the recreational platform pavilion, immediately causing a fire that spread to the entire central building, parts of the second exhibition hall, and the entrance pavilion. Fortunately, the fire brigade responded promptly and effectively, preventing the exhibits and other items from being completely destroyed, suffering only some damage during the firefighting efforts. Afterward, the responsible party, Mr. Yao, was detained and handed over to the police station for transfer to the Public Security Bureau for handling. The damages incurred by the association were substantial. In addition to notifying the Public Security Bureau, the association hereby submits this document to your office for review and requests that the Public Security Bureau order the perpetrator to compensate for the damages, which would be in the public interest.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou National Products Store Requests Introduction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factories Association received a letter yesterday from the Hangzhou National Products Factories Association stating: "Messrs.

Helplessly, on April 16th, I followed the crowd to flee. I arrived here with no luggage, holding only a few clothes. I have been searching for my son, Hongnian, 31 years old, and visiting friends for two months without success. Now, I lack funds to return home.)" The note was signed Wang Yiming, Ruoqin.</p>
<h3>Qiao Liu Cries Out with Iron Chain Around Her Neck</h3>
<p>▲ Qiao A'yong and His Son Flee</p>
<p>▲ Liu Gengsheng Tries to Mediate</p>
<p>Several days ago, Qiao Liu, a rural woman from Beiqiao Town, County, suddenly rushed to the Public Security Third Precinct with an iron chain around her neck, crying out that she was married to Qiao A'yong, the son of Qiao Zhi Rong of the Liang Wang Zou Wu Family Warehouse. Her husband, father-in-law Qiao Zhi Rong, and aunt Qiao Zhang, abused her in every way possible. Since the eighth day of last month, they had been using a massive iron chain to lock her up. She had been living a hellish existence. Today, taking advantage of a moment of inattention, she broke the lock and escaped, coming to the police station to seek justice. After hearing her complaint, Director Zhang immediately sent a police officer to arrest them, but Qiao Zhi Rong and Qiao A'yong, father and son, had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Qiao Zhang was arrested and brought to the station. Director Zhang prepared a document and sent it to the Shanghai County Government. Yesterday, Yao, Section Chief of the Public Security Section, opened the court for questioning. The plaintiff, Qiao Liu, testified about the previous events, which were corroborated by the defendant, Qiao Zhang. Qiao Zhang testified that his daughter-in-law Liu repeatedly ran away and could not be controlled, so she locked her up. She cut off her own hair. During the trial, she was ordered to remove the iron chain from Liu's neck, but she refused, saying she would rather die than return to her husband's house. Her brother, Liu Gengsheng, testified that the matter was being actively mediated by the people and requested that the court not pursue the matter further. The court ruled that they be temporarily detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Wife Abducted by Military Officer</h3>
<p>▲ Wife Struggling to Make Ends Meet</p>
<p>▲ Introduced by Someone to a Paramour</p>
<p>At the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway South Station yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, when the 38th express train to Hangzhou was about to depart, a man in his twenties suddenly appeared, angrily claiming that his wife, Wang, had been abducted by a military officer and that he had come to pursue her. He spotted his wife, Wang, in the ticket office and seized her. At that moment, a military officer walked from the platform to the waiting room and was grabbed by the husband, Huang Guifu. Without asking any questions, he slapped the officer in the face. The officer immediately argued with him, saying, "If your wife didn't come with me willingly, why would you attack me so violently? Where is the evidence that I abducted her?" The husband said, "You have been having an affair for a long time, how dare you deny it?" The wife said that because her husband was unable to support her, she worked in a cosmetics factory. Due to financial difficulties, she was introduced by a relative to the military officer. Now, the officer was returning to Anhui, so she was following him to Hangzhou, then to Anhui via the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. Liu Xueli, patrol officer of the Second District Police Station, saw the two sides arguing endlessly and brought both parties to the Gaochangmiao Police Station. The husband, Huang Guifu, was 28 years old, from Ningbo, and worked as a fishmonger. He married Wang, who was 21 years old and had a three-year-old daughter. They lived at No. 1 Renhe Lane, Jiumu Di. The military officer was Chen Qizhen, a supply officer of the 50th Regiment of the 25th Brigade of the Ninth Division of the Army, over 30 years old. He was ordered to purchase military supplies and was accompanied by several orderlies. He had completed his mission and was traveling to Hangzhou to transfer to Anhui.</p>

<h3>Gas Users Must Beware of Stealing Fire Meters</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Gas Company, on the 24th of last month, someone impersonated a company employee and privately dismantled a gas fire meter at No. 84 Fujian Road. The person involved had been deceived once several months ago and immediately reported it to the police, who took him back to the police station for delivery to the Special District Court. According to his confession, he had stolen no fewer than twenty gas meters with fleeing accomplices. Although the sentence imposed by the court was relatively light, it can be seen that since this person was arrested, there have been no more cases of stealing fire meters, which shows that these people have temporarily disappeared. However, these people's cunning tricks are endless. It is hoped that gas users will be extra careful. If the visitor cannot produce a company certificate, do not allow him to dismantle the fire meter and other equipment. Such thefts often occur in Chinese homes.

<h3>News from Various Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Western Clothing Trade Association, in order to advocate against telephone price increases, sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Concession yesterday and issued a declaration. The original text is as follows: "Our association deeply sympathizes with the declaration against telephone price increases by the Nanjing Road Business Federation and the First District Branch of the Citizen's Association. Telephone service is a public utility, unlike ordinary businesses. Users find it difficult to switch to alternatives. The Shanghai Telephone Company, having obtained the right of patent, should not rely on this patent as a shield to act arbitrarily, nor should a small number of users bear the burden of future equipment for the majority. It should consider the state of commerce, comply with public opinion, and examine the social situation. Since the January 28th Incident when Shanghai was ravaged by Japanese invaders, all businesses have declined, and unemployment is rampant, which goes without saying. If the burden on merchants and residents is further increased, it will be unbearable both in terms of reason and sentiment. Moreover, in this environment of unrecovered public hardship, devastated landscapes, and economic decline, there are even proposals for graded reductions and exemptions for capturing house rent, but only the telephone company cannot exempt fees and even takes the opportunity to increase prices. It is noted that the company disclosed the news of price increases in Chinese newspapers in July of this year, but did not announce the amount. The general public could not foresee the specific figure. Therefore, the company's forced pursuit of previous prices from users is even more unreasonable. This city's merchants and residents should argue strongly based on reason and unite to protest. Moreover, it is a common practice in all countries that overdue accounts cannot be recovered. The company's current threat and intimidation with cutting lines is extremely barbaric and completely devoid of morality. The city's millions of merchants and residents cannot allow it to trample on them and poison them. Our association stands on the same battle line, sharing weal and woe, and cannot remain silent. We must express our resentment, oppose telephone price increases, and hope that all sectors will work together to address this issue. We hereby declare." Furthermore, the letter to the Ratepayers' Association stated: "We respectfully inform you that the case of the Shanghai Telephone Company's price increase has been widely rumored since July of this year. A small number of users have been negligent and passively succumbed to pressure without calculating the consequences. Subsequently, public organizations such as the First District Branch of the Shanghai Citizen's Association and the Nanjing Road Business Federation have listed the reasons why prices should not be increased, repeatedly argued based on reason, and published declarations of protest. We believe that your association has already taken notice. Our association, considering the economic state of this city, believes it is difficult to bear this burden. We have long known that your association upholds justice. We have read your association's letter to the Municipal Council, which is stern, righteous, and persuasive, deeply resonating with the public sentiment. We are immensely grateful and hope that your association will persevere to the end, sympathize, and assist, vowing to achieve the cancellation of the original proposal for telephone price increases. This would be fortunate for merchants and residents alike. This is addressed to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Concession."</p>

Passed. (F) Half of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's membership fees have not yet been paid. How should this be handled? Public decision: The fees should be collected in advance from the registration fees within this month. (G) How should the payment of membership fees by members be regulated? Public decision: After the registration is completed, representatives from various groups will be convened to discuss the matter together. The meeting adjourned. The Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai knows that since the solicitation of members, the number of joiners has long exceeded the original quota, and the number of those who continue to join is still enthusiastic. The association has now received letters from various solicitation committee members to extend the deadline. After discussion, it was decided to extend the solicitation period until the end of December to allow more fellow-provincials to participate, thereby avoiding being left out and aiming for widespread participation.</p>
<p>The Henan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, recently because the Yuna, Guangshan area of southern Henan province and the Linzhang area of northern Henan province were devastated by red bandits and floods. Although the red bandits have now been suppressed and eliminated by Commander-in-Chief Chiang, the area has become a wasteland, and the general victims have no clothes, no food, and no homes to return to. Men, women, old, and young are displaced everywhere, and the starving are everywhere. Commander-in-Chief Chiang has previously telegraphed all parties, requesting relief, and Shanghai's celebrities and charitable organizations have even formed a temporary relief association for the disaster areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. The association specially convened a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees to discuss relief together.</p>

<h3>Judge Feithang's Report on the Situation of the Shanghai International Settlement, Volume 4 (12)</h3>
<p>C. Financial Committee's Control of Finances</p>
<p>6. After the budget has received its necessary approval, the Finance Department of the Municipal Council should pay attention not only to the fact that the amount of expenditure does not exceed the budget, and that its use is limited to what has been approved, but also that such use cannot be spent without being handled in accordance with the powers conferred by the department.</p>
<p>7. The entire management of the Municipal Council's finances is concentrated in the Finance Department, which is the sole agency responsible for paying funds and keeping accounts. Therefore, its position is sufficient to effectively restrict the expenses of other departments. The Finance Officer's statement explains the principles and methods of all financial controls in the department as follows:</p>
<p>(The Board has ruled that the inclusion of a designated expenditure in the budget does not mean that this is approved and that the plan for this expenditure can be implemented immediately. (Note 3). Therefore, before implementing each of these plans, the head of the department concerned must submit detailed proposals, and if it concerns construction projects, it should be submitted together with the drawings for formal approval. If it only involves three hundred taels of silver, or less than three hundred taels, and there is no matter of principle involved, then once a form requesting the purchase of goods is filled out, it is deemed that a proposal has already been submitted.</p>
<p>The statement then proceeds to describe the various books used by the Municipal Council to control the use of each department and to compile the financial records of the Council. For my present purpose, it is only necessary to mention two of them, namely the (form for requesting the purchase of goods) and the (fixed expenditure registration book). The statement describes these two books as follows:</p>
<p>(Form for requesting the purchase of goods) This book is the basis of the entire financial control method, so it is subject to extremely strict examination and supervision. Its initial purpose is as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ Accurately record and register the needs of the relevant department.</p>
<p>㈡ Because the book lists budget items, it is sufficient to assist in restricting expenses to the narrowest possible scope.</p>
<p>㈢ Supplemented by the ordering books of each department, it makes it easy to estimate all outstanding debts.</p>
<p>The forms for requesting the purchase of goods from each department are compiled by the departments themselves and sent to the Finance Officer on a regular basis. The Finance Officer examines and approves the items listed in the forms.</p>
<p>The Finance Officer examines each expenditure item by item and, when necessary, reports any matters that need to be criticized. Before 1929, the forms for requesting the purchase of goods were signed by the Finance Officer and sent to the Municipal Secretary, who forwarded them to the relevant committee. However, since 1929, the registration of the forms has been correct. The Finance Officer is responsible to the Board and only reports to the Board those matters that the officer deems appropriate to report in accordance with the financial regulations summarized above (Note 4).</p>
<p>Fixed expenditure registration book This book is an appendage to the previous book. Its purpose is to compile regular fixed expenses under fixed expenditure items. Once each of these expenses is entered into the form for requesting the purchase of goods, the Finance Officer will add a few words to indicate that the expense is approved to be included in the fixed expenditure registration book. After it is approved in this way, this debt can be included in the fixed expenditure registration book for future expenditure items, which is only a routine matter.)</p>
<p>8. The above-mentioned method enables the Finance Department to exercise a very complete and effective control over the funds required by other departments, but the responsibility for exercising this control rests with the Finance Officer, who is the head of the Finance Department. As for the Finance Committee, and any standing committees related to each department, they do not effectively share the responsibility of controlling expenses. The Finance Officer has indeed pointed out that the method of sending the forms for requesting the purchase of goods to each committee has been abandoned.</p>
<p>9. In the regulations defining the duties of the Finance Officer, the powers that the officer can exercise over the goods purchase requests of each department are described as follows:</p>
<p>The officer shall review the goods purchase request forms and payment forms of each department. If the funds requested have not been included in the budget or have not been approved by the Board, the officer has the right to refuse to allocate them.</p>
<p>The above provision authorizes the Finance Officer to firmly require that any proposed expenditure that has not been included in the budget must be submitted to the Board or committee for approval. However, if the proposed expenditure is expected to obtain the approval it needs, it can obviously be approved by the department at its discretion.</p>
<p>D. Responsibility of the Finance Committee</p>
<p>10. The Board's power to dispose of public funds is stipulated in Article 25 of the Land Regulations, which has been quoted above. The wording of this article seems to be deliberately formulated in this way, so that the Board is not overly bound by the detailed expenditure items stipulated in the budget. The Board may (dispose of public funds in accordance with the budget that has been approved) but may not exceed the total amount of expenditure approved by the annual meeting. The only body with the power to decide on raising funds is the inconvenient general meeting of taxpayers, so it is obviously necessary to leave some room for the Board to exercise discretion. The Board's obligation to submit the audited expenditure accounts of the previous year to the annual meeting held in April is to ensure that the various budgets approved by the budget resolution are given due respect. The resolution to approve the submitted accounts of the previous year is to ensure that the expenditure exceeding the amount listed under any item in the budget is formally approved by the taxpayers.</p>
<p>11. It is undoubtedly true that some flexibility must be allowed in the use of the funds prepared in the budget resolution, but if it is necessary to allow such flexibility, then for the sake of respecting the budget and saving money, supervising expenditure is obviously an important task, and the Finance Committee can be expected to bear a large part of this task. Detailed supervision must be handled by the Finance Officer, but the Finance Committee should be in close contact with the Finance Officer regarding this supervision. In this way, the committee can acknowledge its responsibilities to the Board in terms of policy implementation, and can ensure that successive Finance Officers maintain the necessary attention to expenditure. Otherwise, if a proposed expenditure is deemed necessary to be stopped by the Finance Officer before obtaining special approval, the officer can also be confident that the Finance Committee will approve and support it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the general principle discussed in the previous chapter regarding the need for close contact between the committees and the heads of departments seems to be particularly applicable to the relationship between the Finance Committee and the Finance Officer.</p>
<p>12. According to the existing situation, it is obvious that the most important part of the Finance Committee's work is the task of preparing the budget before submitting it to the annual meeting of taxpayers held in April, and that the committee does not meet regularly during the year. The Remuneration Committee is the committee to which all matters relating to staff should be submitted for consideration first. The establishment of this committee seems to have canceled all the previous tasks of the Finance Committee, thereby making it less continuously and effectively involved in the general financial management of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>E. Limits of the Responsibilities of the Finance Committee</p>
<p>13. Within a British municipal government, the position of the Finance Committee is particularly important. The establishment of a Finance Committee by a municipal government has long become a habit, and this habit has been recognized by the local government laws of the second half of the 19th century. The Finance Committee of the County Council is required to be established and is granted special powers, which are sometimes interpreted as being able to veto the recommendations of other committees. It is obviously objectionable to allow any committee of a city council to be in such a special position, but it must be known that the finances of British local governments have greatly benefited from the establishment of Finance Committees. This committee is responsible for undertaking the general task of supervising finances and must submit a report to the city council on all recommendations involving the use of funds, from a financial point of view, before the city council itself votes on them.</p>
<p>14. The various provisions regarding the tasks of the Finance Committee contained in British regulations have been adopted by the municipal regulations of other countries, with modifications to their procedures. To give an example, I will now submit the various provisions regarding the Finance Committee contained in the Municipal Regulations of Durbanville (Note 5). According to the regulations (the City Council shall organize a Finance Committee at any time to regulate and control the City Council's finances), (no expenditure shall be allocated unless it is listed in the detailed budget submitted by the Finance Committee and approved by the City Council). It should be noted that this provision is usually supplemented by the rules of the City Council or the scope of authority of the Finance Committee, so that the Finance Committee must fulfill an obligation, that is, regardless of whether the Finance Committee itself agrees with the recommendation to request the allocation of funds, the committee must prepare a budget of the costs required for this recommendation and submit it to the City Council. Regarding financial matters, the Finance Committee is usually responsible for advising the City Council, and the specific purpose of the Finance Committee in sending the aforementioned budget is to ensure that the recommendation involving expenditure is not put to a vote unless the budget of the costs required has been sent by the Finance Committee (to be continued)</p>

<h3>Zhang, Righteousness and Brilliance of the Sea of Hatred</h3>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Diamond, Shen Yong</h3>
<p>---</p>
<p>Things are valued because they are rare. Diamond, because of its scarce production and its most tempting, brilliant light, the most precious thing in the world that everyone envies and desires is the diamond that can be used as an ornament. In fact, it is just a lifeless mineral.</p>
<p>Diamonds are mostly isometric crystal gifts of eight or twelve sides, etc. The pure ones are transparent and colorless, and sometimes contain slight impurities, so they are yellow, red, green, or brown. And the ability to refract light is also very strong, which can reflect all kinds of brilliant brilliance.</p>
<p>It has the highest hardness in all substances, so it can be used as a diamond mine. As for its chemical composition, it is pure carbon (Carbon). If we heat the diamond, we can see it gradually expand and become a black substance. Continuing to add heat, it is oxidized and synthesized into carbon dioxide gas. This test can show that it is pure carbon without a doubt.</p>
<p>Natural diamonds are mostly produced in the gravel along the coast of rivers and seas. South Africa (South Afria) has the most, accounting for about 90% of the total output. India, Brazil, and the Lijiagang area of southern Xiang, Yizhou, Shandong Province, China, also have them. However, what is produced in China is a black diamond.</p>
<p>Originally, there are many kinds of diamonds. Now, let's describe the various kinds and their effects separately.</p>
<p>Love River is the Sea of Hatred! Young people, do not fall!</p>
<p>㈠ Black Diamond (Carbonado)｜ is a black crystalline body with extremely hard properties, so it cannot be split open and can only be used in diamond rock drilling machines to drill holes and mine.</p>
<p>㈡ Diamond Grit (Bort)｜ has a radial fiber structure, the color is very dark, and the surface is often spherical, which can be used for grinding.</p>
<p>㈢ Crystal Diamond ｜ If this kind has color and brilliance, it can be made into the ornament that the world envies the most. If it is dark, it can only be used to cut glass.</p>
<p>This kind of crystal diamond ｜ Used to make ornaments, it depends more on artificial grinding. The grinding is made into a number of facets to help the realization of reflected light. There are three types of grinding: ㈠ Rose Style (Rosette)｜ has a flat surface as the bottom surface, and the side surface is a number of triangles.</p>
<p>㈡ Bright Style (Brilliant)｜ is made by splitting and grinding the diamond.</p>
<p>㈢ Olive Style (Briolett)｜ is olive-shaped. As for its formation method, it is not very clear, but now there is a method of making fake diamonds, which was invented by a great French chemist, Maissan.</p>
<p>His method is to heat iron to above 1300 degrees Celsius to melt the iron into liquid. Then add carbon and heat it to dissolve it in the iron liquid. Then cool the mixture of carbon and iron to solidify it. When it solidifies, its volume gradually shrinks. At the same time, the carbon in the iron is under great pressure and turns into diamond. This diamond will not dissolve in hydrochloric acid, so immerse it in hydrochloric acid. The iron will be dissolved, and the diamond will be formed.</p>

<h3>Talking about Advocating Short Clothing Issues</h3>
<p>— Bai</p>
<p>Clothing is a kind of social limit. A part of human life, because of this relationship, we can't help but pay attention to it. No one can say; I don't want to wear clothes. If I want to wear clothes, I have to study it. In the past, there were often research results. Although men's clothing changes less, there are also many significant differences. The fact that fewer people are wearing mandarin jackets can also prove that people are finally making progress. Let's look at women's clothing.</p>
<p>In modern times, women are increasingly seen as playthings and entertainment tools as the level of life increases. Short clothes become cheongsams, short robes turn into long robes, because they are suitable for dancing, strolling, and accompanying men. These advances are exactly the opposite and are obstacles to progress. The above is my general discussion on clothing. The conclusion is that a correct rule for clothing must be established, which should be a system suitable for the body.</p>
<p>1. Men should adopt Guangdong-style short clothes, similar in shape to student uniforms, but without the inconvenience of student uniforms. The drawbacks of binding and compressing the chest can be avoided, and the inconvenience of raising hands can also be avoided. And student uniforms will show an untidy shape if they have slight folds, while the short clothes in question are more accommodating. Therefore, I advocate (Guangdong theory) for men's clothing.</p>
<p>2. Women cannot get rid of their status as commodities in this society, so their clothing should be beautiful. I will not create new clothing styles, but only select from the existing types of clothing. I am against the current long cheongsam because it fascinates men's legs, and at the same time, it means that the curves of women's beauty are covered up, and they cannot be freely displayed for people to admire. These are women's (authorities,) and should never be buried. However, methods that are too tight and restrict physiological development are unacceptable. This opinion is not my personal opinion, but is based on the opinions of many people. 3. Children's clothing should also be determined. In my observation, the best is the naval uniform, which is very suitable for underage children.</p>
<p>Under the title of (Advocating Short Clothing), I was attracted, but I actively put forward three opinions on short clothing, but I don't know what kind of evaluation I can get. Approval and dissent can only be decided by the public.</p>
<p>Just talk about it</p>
<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>— Flood</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I visited their home. Now I suddenly received a phone call from Li Ying inviting me to chat, but I am most afraid of visiting friends and being a guest because I inevitably encounter a general who is full of airs and graces at the gate to make things difficult for you, (pushing the cart against the wall) and asking you to stand outside the door for a while. Moreover, Li Ying's house is heavily guarded. But since I have the sincerity of the host, how can I refuse to go!</p>
<p>We started talking about our recent lives and then discussed the very serious matter of national affairs...</p>
<p>(I guess you also advocate for the cloth clothing movement, admiration, admiration!) Li Ying said, looking at the free-style cloth long gown I was wearing... (Look, now every street is still densely covered with flags advertising big sales. Clever old merchants are also taking advantage of the climate and various names to call them spring sales, winter sales... especially when the market is flooded with foreign goods and the social economy is playing out a "empty city strategy," big sales have become an "uninvited guest," occurring one after another!) Li Ying said with a smiling face, skillfully knitting a pink coat in her hands.</p>
<p>(That's right, the society is in a critical state, how terribly shaken!) I sighed deeply. (And now, the so-called big sales are completely driven by old stock. Unscrupulous merchants are taking this opportunity to use the name of big sales to dump old stock, which is equivalent to reaping three times the profit; so I simply dare not go out to buy things, and if I'm not careful, I'll fall into their trap!)</p>
<p>(Yes, it's clearly old stock disguised, but they insist on saying it's completely domestic goods in a grand and righteous way, advocating domestic goods in a confusing way to deceive customers. The cunning of unscrupulous merchants deserves to be punished!)</p>
<p>(Ah! Our servants are really too pitiful! If you talk to them, they always say with a smile... (Cheap and good, a rare opportunity.) Alas! Just think, how would they know that imperialists are using us to</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>absorb economic resources day and night in arsenals, mass-producing weapons to cruelly kill and destroy us! How would they know that newspapers are already full of news about enemy troops conducting street fighting exercises in Tianjin, or inspecting military drills in Hebei!)</p>
<p>In short, Li, the way out for the country and the nation is to actively promote politics to get on track, and then we can talk about revitalizing the country's production. On the passive side, everyone must resolutely and unanimously bring out their conscience to resist foreign goods. This can be said to be our only weapon! If we find any unscrupulous merchants who are blinded by profit, we can also use the last resort of "pacifying internal unrest and resisting external aggression" to deal with them, why just be angry? We must build a solid and broad front, and bravely charge forward together. National difficulties can be overcome, how can we not thoroughly resist just foreign goods?)</p>

<h3>The Amiable Landlady</h3>
<p>For a man without a woman seeking a living in Shanghai, the problem of accommodation is even more difficult than the problem of food. If you are hungry and only have twenty cents left in your pocket, you can go to a small restaurant for onion noodles, or you can easily find sesame cakes and fried dough sticks everywhere, and you can muddle through the day... If you have money and are "bare," don't even think about renting a small room on the second floor or a kitchen extension!</p>
<p>D, who is in the ranks of the "bare," is also full of the smell of earth. This was his first time in Shanghai. Although he had a lot of things that his father had earned from the fields barefoot and bare-armed with sweat and blood, he should have been satisfied with everything. But this "accommodation problem" deeply troubled him for a whole month.</p>
<p>He often wandered around residential areas. Once, he saw a red paper slip pasted at the entrance of a lane. He identified the number and went to inquire with a heart of (inevitably being rejected). This was a one-up-one-down house. What was for rent was a small room on the second floor, with a monthly rent of sixteen silver dollars. After negotiation, the landlady was satisfied and surprisingly succeeded.</p>
<p>Besides the landlady living in the living room downstairs, D lived with... one family each in the front and back rooms upstairs, one family in a room made of the balcony, one family in a small attic made next to the stairs... one family in the back wing room downstairs, one family in the kitchen extension... Statistically, there were eight families living in this house; a total of twenty-five men, women, and children.</p>
<p>The landlady was a woman with genuine oriental morbid beauty. She was only in her thirties, she had a (willow waist) and (lotus steps), an oval face, slender arms, flat chest, and a thin figure... She was very amiable and often came to chat in the room, and also invited D to sit in her room. She told him that she sympathized most with men without women, and she believed that it was extremely unreasonable and inhumane for landlords not to rent houses to single men. She also told D not to be polite, that living in the same house meant being family, and she could help him as much as possible with any difficult problems.</p>
<p>The landlady was not only gentle, amiable, and sympathetic, but she was also kind, righteous, and hospitable. Just the fact that there were many young men and women coming and going to her room every day, especially at night, was an ironclad proof.</p>
<p>(Where is your husband making a fortune?...) D found a glass cabinet in her room. In the cabinet were many large and small porcelain bottles, each with a red label on it with the name of the medicine.</p>
<p>(Um, um, he is studying chemistry and is now a doctor.) When D asked this question, she hesitated a little, but still had a smiling face.</p>
<p>One day at dusk, D returned from a friend's house and found a large crowd of people crowding at the back door of his house, with heads bobbing. He stretched his neck and looked into the house. He didn't know what was wrong in the house, and he couldn't squeeze in even with all his strength, and his throat was hoarse from shouting.</p>
<p>After a while, five or six armed Chinese and Western detectives dragged out a man in a long gown and a mandarin jacket and a thin woman with disheveled hair. The detectives held many porcelain bottles in their hands and took them away menacingly. D still didn't understand what was going on, but he heard the neighbors talking about (aborting and killing people... privately running a brothel... secretly prostituting...)</p>
<p>When a court seal was posted on the door of D's residence, he once again savored the troubles of living.</p>

<h3>Chinese People are Good at Adapting and Imitating - Chen Dabei</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>If we one day achieve a politically clear and happy environment, if our society can establish many actor training institutions, and with the guidance of capable coaching talents, we will definitely be able to obtain many, many actors who are even better than those on the American screen today.</p>
<p>Don't you believe it? Before it becomes a reality, how can I make people laugh at me for making exaggerated claims? But this is a bit of truth that I have discovered from more than ten years of directing dramas. I firmly believe that the performing talent of our people is indeed above that of any other nation. The key to performance is adaptation, which is imitation. The Japanese believe that their ability to imitate is superior to that of Westerners, but they are still one step behind the Chinese. Let's take an analogy. If you ask your American friends if they have ever seen Chinese people speak American English as fluently as Americans, they will definitely tell you that they have seen many, many people. If you ask your British, German, or French friends, you will definitely get the same result. But then close your eyes and think quietly for a moment, have you heard any foreigners who can completely get rid of their native accent and say a few authentic and crisp Chinese phrases? Then you will understand. I dare not argue strongly that we Chinese are not as good as other countries in other aspects, but in terms of adaptation or imitation, I am 100% sure that our Chinese ability is indeed superior to any other country.</p>
<p>If our national fortune one day takes a turn for the better, if our ideal training plan can one day be realized, I can at most prove it to you with facts within five years.</p>
<p>Why can our Chinese performing arts surpass the achievements of any nation in the world? This is also very easy to understand, because the bloodline of our Chinese nation is extremely complex. The more complex the bloodline, the more adaptable it is to various environments. Nations with simple bloodlines, no matter how hard they try in the performing arts, always retain some clumsy rusticity. This rusticity is the proof that they cannot change and cannot adapt. Therefore, only nations with complex bloodlines can achieve the artistic effect of (dressing like a dragon like a dragon, dressing like a tiger like a tiger).</p>

<h3>Soviet Children's Films</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Since the Soviet Union put forward the slogan of using films to improve the educational level of the people, it has also recognized the necessity of using films for children's education. In the film conference convened in Moscow in 1927, it was decided to produce 25% of children's films and to establish specialized institutions to engage in research. The themes of the films are often linked to various (struggle) issues and other real social problems. For example, (The Secret of Gold) and (Torn Sleeves) aim to help vagrant children, oppose the adverse effects of vagrant children on ordinary children, expose their illusory attempts, awaken their feelings of sympathy for the rules of young pioneers, and at the same time teach them to work hard for socialist construction. (Three People) mainly depicts children in rural and urban areas and homeless children participating in the Young Pioneers. (Adults and Children) depicts children opposing bureaucracy and profiteers and obtaining common welfare for children. (Hotel Girl) is linked to the alcohol prohibition movement. There is also the short comedy (Toy Film), which is based on the lives of animals and machines. This special production is made for children in school.</p>
<p>The performance of these children's films does not require fixed actors. It can completely utilize organized children, that is, a part of the club members or a part of the Young Pioneers are excellent actors. Directors, photographers, etc. only need to go to the children's venues to guide and produce.</p>
<p>The screening of children's films is also organized and planned. For example, the famous Moscow Cultural Cinema regularly screens children's films. During the screening, a brief explanation is given to the children. At the same time, books or news magazines related to this film are displayed in another room of the cinema.</p>
<p>From this, we can understand how much the Soviet government authorities pay attention to the education of children and how hard they work for the construction of socialism.</p>
<h3>Review of (The Old Dark House)</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>The Old Dark House occupies a very glorious position in American films. Based on our experience, the results obtained from using famous novels as scripts are often very satisfactory, because its organization already has a sound framework. This film can be regarded as Universal's masterpiece. The director's skills are very sharp, the vision is very meticulous, and the photography almost completely uses very dark light, but the performance does not neglect at all, and strives to express mystery and horror. In particular, many shots are filmed very beautifully and make people feel satisfied when they see them.</p>
<p>This film also has a special feature, which is makeup. The makeup of Maogen and Roderick is amazing. The scenery of mountains and waters shows the greatness of nature, making people feel as if they are in the scene and feel the insignificance of themselves in the universe. The interior scene of the old house is also the best of scenery.</p>
<p>Karloff, who plays Jin Maogen, is nominally the protagonist, but in fact, he is not much more burdensome than others. He plays a reckless and savage man, and his style is very different from that of Frankenstein. He is truly so-called capable of everything.</p>
<p>The other nine people are all very good. I have said that this film is equally important to ten people. Its overall beauty is not the power of one or two people. Only in the first half, the performances of Charles Laughton and Lilian Bond are slightly more fiery, but it will not affect the highlights of the film.</p>
<p>This film can indeed make people's heartstrings tremble all the time, and make you shout out in a hurry for the characters in the film. Every inch of the film is tightly holding people's emotions.</p>
<p>I don't want to say it's good again, but at least I can say (do you remember the deceased Lang Que Nai? If you like to watch exciting and mysterious films, such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame, London After Midnight, etc., then this film is a substitute in sound.</p>

<h3>Pouring Cold Water on Foreigners</h3>
<p>— Not Sensitive</p>
<p>I saw a picture, or a series of pictures, in a foreign film magazine, in which a makeup artist transformed an American into a Chinese. The makeup artist drew the eyebrows of this unfortunate American upwards and also raised the corners of his eyes. As a result, he became a (standard Chinaman. So he actually regarded himself as a master and called himself a miracle. Miracle is really wonderful, but in my opinion, it doesn't look like it at all, and it doesn't look like anything. This kind of miracle is too miraculous.</p>
<p>Here is a short letter written by a Chinese person living in the United States. He submitted it to the letters column of Motion Picture and won a prize of ten gold coins. I will translate it below:</p>
<p>(I am a Chinese, I left my hometown many years ago and came to your country. I received many years of education in universities everywhere, so on many issues, my views can be said to be mostly assimilated with Americans. However, I really don't agree with the way our race is depicted in movies. This is a feeling I often have when I see it, especially when Americans dress up as Chinese.</p>
<p>(In my motherland, I have seven sisters. They are all movie fans. When they see white people acting as Chinese in beautiful and real Chinese backgrounds, they laugh so hard that they can't catch their breath. This is really ridiculous. Now almost all Americans know from the instructions in movies that Chinese women walk with hurried (small steps), and noble men stand upright with their hands in their bellies, but they don't know that no matter how noble a Chinese person is, he won't put his hands on his belly unless his stomach hurts, and Chinese women are not all as shy as women in the Victorian era. In the past, when they had bound feet, they might have had this pitiful and lovely (small step), but now their lotus boats are three feet long and they walk as fast as flying. The traces of the past have become the Guangling San today.</p>
<p>(American films often imply that Chinese people are insidious and evil, which is not entirely true. If I just mention one person, (killing without blinking an eye) (honey in the mouth, dagger in the heart) are more powerful than Chinese people, so why don't your country's film producers strive for authenticity and use a few real Chinese people to make a film that can truly depict the real situation in China? I finished reading this letter, and I really wanted to take out a piece of foreign letter paper, type it on the typewriter in the same way, sign my own name, and send it to the United States, but unfortunately, I may not be able to get the prize of ten gold coins again!</p>
<p>Since Tianyi Company started filming sound films, the Chinese film industry has suddenly added some figures from the foreign film industry. Taking Tianyi as an example, there are two foreign old men (rental agents for sound recording equipment), one is "Chas Hugo" Xu Gao, and the other is "Leon Britton" Bai Liding. Xu Guo went to England a few days ago, and Bai Liding has taken back Tianyi's sound recording equipment because Shao Zuiweng no longer wants to use his equipment. In recent days, because Bai Liding's equipment has no one to rent, he has gathered six foreign capitalists, each taking out 10,000 Chinese silver coins, totaling 60,000 yuan, to prepare to shoot only one drama. It is not a foreign drama, but uses Chinese people, Chinese scenery, and Chinese society as the background, but the language is English dialogue. In addition to himself, there is also a Chinese person as an assistant director.</p>
<p>A few days ago, there was an advertisement in the advertisement column of the Xinwen News (recruiting actresses), which stated (must be proficient in English). That was the advertisement posted by Bai Liding. According to Bai Liding personally told reporters, the actresses recruited this time are extremely strictly examined in terms of the beauty and fitness of their faces and bodies. Those with a slight morbidity will not be accepted.</p>
<p>In the past two days, they have already taken two satisfactory landscapes in Suzhou and Hangzhou, and took photos for reference in preparation for location shooting. The working period will begin as soon as the actress is selected.</p>
<p>The Chinese drama with English dialogue with foreign capital is about to be filmed.</p>
<p>Before they started filming, the reporter first reported to the readers that this Chinese drama with foreign capital may be a probe for foreign economic invasion in the mainland, and may even be a bad film that humiliates our nation. Before they start working, we cannot be dogmatic, but we have to worry. We would like to inform the readers that if your relatives and friends are selected as actresses, be sure to pay attention to the script itself. If there is a plot that humiliates our nation, we must not covet the salary of 10,000 yuan and sell our personal personality and humiliate the Chinese national system.</p>
<h3>Latecomer Star Ms. Ai Xia - Gift from Gu Wenzong</h3>
<p>Foreign Theory Compilation</p>
<h3>Trends in Soviet Films in the Last Fifteen Years｜Based on the Opinions of Mr. Harry Alan Potamkin｜</h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>The content of early Soviet films, in terms of theme and material, was beyond reproach, but limited by the immaturity at the time, its ideals could not be effectively realized, and therefore the following two false values inevitably occurred: first, an extreme proletarianism, which in reality is a petty bourgeois self-consciousness; second, it fell into a literalism. They needed training in two aspects, ideological and technical.</p>
<p>However, if we do not study this period of Soviet films as a historical pre-birth era, then we will inevitably make the mistake of distortion. This period, that is, the section where Soviet filmmakers, in an unprepared state, switched from bitter recognition to new themes, we can call the period of spontaneousness. This spontaneousness was quickly eliminated by the awakened sense of purpose and replaced by the unified movement of film power. Therefore, it is wrong to call a film called (Polikushka) the first Soviet film, because this is the first work that contains an understanding of the essence of film drama. However, this still cannot be regarded as associating the revolutionary experience with the theatrical representation of the film, explaining it, or transforming it into art and making it even more deified. The first to link the revolutionary experience with shadow drama was Pudovkin ｜his work (Mother)｜, Eisenstein ｜Alexandrov｜ his work (Strike) and (Battleship Potemkin)｜, Reisman ｜his work (In Ancient Siberia) and others. During this period, Soviet films expanded the scope of film drama aesthetics. It also absorbed from the Swedish local shadow drama, from the (golden age) of the German film industry, from the various vulgar tunes of American films, and even from the mediocre set of Griffith, and from this decayed and transformed into magic. As Mr. Leon Moussinac said, the participation of the Soviet｜film as a part of (revolution) has expanded and increased the breadth and depth of the original film.</p>
<p>In terms of the role of the world played by Soviet films, that production principle has become something that makes people feel interesting, and that makes general film directors inevitably confuse them from their satisfying experiences. It is not surprising. This principle, which is called Montage, will actually become an element of the world film culture that is constantly innovating itself. This is not only for Soviet films, but also for the entire film drama. In practice, this has strengthened the power of the film, which originally had supreme power. Today's Soviet film institutions believe that it is not difficult to reach the ultimate point of contact with human experience by using these tools. However, this does not mean that there is no relationship of dependence on the past primitive period. (To be continued)</p>
