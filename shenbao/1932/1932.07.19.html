<p>時評</p>
<h3>敬告今年的大學畢業生彬·</h3>
<p>在迅速得如像白駒過隙一樣的時間之波流中。目前是已臨到了暑假丨丨一個學年的盡頭。</p>
<p>就在這幾星期之中全國各地大學校又將有大批學生畢業而出。除了一小部分能繼續求學而外。其他大部分必然的將從此終了其黄金時代的學生生活。而開始踏進社會。</p>
<p>然而在諸君提起脚踏入社會之先。諸君對於自已是否曾有過一番整個的打算呢。換言之。你們準備做些什麽呢。</p>
<p>這裏我所說的自然不是問諸君將怎樣去尋覓職業。怎樣去謀得衣食。或者是怎樣走上新政客官僚之路。因爲這些都是「個人問題。」都不是我現在想討論的問題。我所問的是在於怎樣體認這個動盪的時代。這個破落的社會。這個多災多難瀕於危急存亡的國家。同時。更怎樣體認自已所應負的使命打算做個怎樣的人。</p>
<p>不錯。「個人問題。」並不能不算是一個急待解答的問題。也許在諸君對於「職業」「生活」以及「個人出路」等問題。看得更爲迫切。更爲重要。但事實上。「個人問題。」是只有放在整個社會問題之中。才能找得其依據。同時。亦惟有在整個社會問題獲得解决之。後個人問題也才能解决。在目前破落崩潰動盪黑暗的社會裏。失業。飢寒。刑罰。死亡。時時圍繞在每一個人丨丨除特殊階級而外丨丨的周遭。在大衆失業的唏嘘聲裏。在大衆飢寒的哀號聲裏。諸君的職業。諸君的衣食。能夠單獨解决嗎。即使暫時能。但終於不過是「暫時。」所以我說「個人問題。」只有在整個社會問題獲得解决之後。才能解决。於此。諸君當可以看淸自已的地位。并可以認淸個人在痛苦的大衆中所應負荷的使命。</p>
<p>依據於去年敎育部所發表的統計。全國僅有大學三十四所。專門學校十六所。大學生僅一萬二千二百二十五人。專門學生二千一百六十八人。以我國全人口四萬萬五千萬人爲比例。九百萬人中才有大學一所。三萬一千一百三十五人中才有大學生一人。諸君能在三萬餘人中爭得一個受大學敎育的機會。那末諸君已經是很幸運了。但三萬餘的多數人榨取其血汗。以供給諸君受大學敎育。這與其說是諸君幸運。毌寗說是正所以顯不諸君使命的加重。諸君是社會的優越份子。眼前正陳列着許多問題。切盼着諸君動手做。</p>
<p>「認淸時代」「認淸自已」這是諸君應時時兩句話。時代很顯然的是在轉變。空前的經濟恐慌。已使這世界感到空前的苦悶。在我國内。則由於九一八以來外敵之壓迫。與内政之愈趨於混亂。社會經濟日益破落。人民生計亦日益艱苦。社會亦正在轉移其動向。這是一個非常的時代。也是一個偉大的時代。在這非常的偉大的時代裏。諸君將怎樣處置自已呢。換言之。諸君是打算把自已作成一種怎樣的「力」呢。丨丨是推進時代的「力」呢。抑是障碍時代進展的「力」呢。</p>
<p>「信仰」是眞實的覺悟。也是生命力之泉源。在認淸了時代。認淸了社會之後。諸君尤必確定自已的信仰。遵依着你自已的信仰去努力。否則你便將如盲人騎着瞎馬。在黑暗中亂竄。或者是你踐踏了别人。或者是别人踐踏了你。</p>
<p>我認爲目前是已臨到了空前動盪的堦段。中國尤其是已臨到了空前腐亂的堦段。諸君必須從經濟的觀點上去體認大衆生存的出路。同時勇敢地把握自已出路。悲與憤。傷感與頽唐。都是無用的。其結果適都等於自殺。</p>
<p>當諸君開始踏進社會之先。我謹獻與諸君這一點意見。并敬祝諸君奮鬥的新生活之開頭。</p>

<p>自德國）但機件購就之後、至今猶未能到用、此項鍊事業所以未能早日進行者、因先則爭論廠址問題、費時甚多、其後滿鐵會社又不能代籌必要用費、故遷延迄今猶未開工、最近鋼鐵跌價、日本鋼鐵過剩、而日本政府不敢即時採用鋼鐵政策、有此種種原因、故該廠不得不實行關閉、</p>

<p>宋慶齡來京請保　宋慶齡楊杏佛等、因悉法長羅文幹·次長鄭天錫之辭職、非因彼等之請保牛蘭夫婦、故决定再度請保、楊杏佛於十六晨抵京後、曾兩度往訪羅文幹、羅當以聲請暫保、於法固無不合、但在法院未便以行政而干涉司法、且本人業已辭職、更無權過問、故請楊等向承審該案之江蘇高等法院接洽、十六夜、宋慶齡女士亦由滬乘車來京、十七晨七時許到達、下車後、即會同楊杏佛到江寗地方法院看守所探視牛蘭夫婦、告以再度請保之意、并進安慰之詞、宋楊等旋離院往訪羅文幹、但羅因赴外前部處理要公、致未面晤、十一時、宋楊等偕牛蘭夫婦之戚馮傑思、同赴江寗地方法院、時司法行政部李司長亦到、遂即同在會客室商談保釋手續、</p>
<p>法院准許暫保釋　宋楊李馮等、在會客室中商談時、均用英語、并禁止他人入室、商談達一小時半、以楊杏佛發言爲最多、謁盡其請釋責任、聞最初宋楊等仍擬請法院准許移送上海醫治、但法院以該案在管轄問題未解决前、仍須繼續審訊、如開庭不能隨傳隨到、將使該案進行審訊、發生極大困難、且牛蘭夫婦移送上海時、沿途是否發生意外、亦未可知、保人須負完全責任、故未允准、宋楊等亦以責任過於重大、故商談結果、决定仍在本京就醫、十二時半、宋楊等遂至牛蘭夫婦處告知此意、牛蘭夫婦遂表不同意、宋楊李等遂又返會客室商洽、當以日來天氣炎熱、醫院中恐亦未妥、故决定在總理陵園附近、擇一適當房屋、每日延醫診治、當宋楊李會商時、江蘇高等法院刑庭長黎冕、雖已於十六夜由蘇返京、但以審理期間、𢌞避見客、故未參加商談、但對宋楊等商談結果、表示同意、故即批准、</p>
<p>牛蘭夫婦離法院　江蘇高等法院批准暫准保釋後、江寗地主法院看守所、遂即籌備一切手續、至下午七時半、江蘇高等法院、遂即簽提牛蘭夫婦出看守所、牛蘭夫婦因絶食已十六日、不能行走、由看守所派人抬出至門外登汽車、開往總理陵園附近之屋中療養、江蘇高等法院並派警前往看守、聞牛蘭夫婦、自離法院後、已表示即日復食、將由醫士妥爲調養、先進以液汁之滋養品、聞宋慶齡楊杏佛等、以手續已畢、十七夜即離京赴滬、</p>
<p>法律專家憤慨語　記者十七日晤本京之某法律專家、即詢對牛蘭夫婦絶食案之意見、承發表公正詳盡之意見如次、「牛蘭夫婦犯危害民國罪案、情節至爲重大、但辦理手續、則殊爲簡單、祇須由法院依法審訊調查證據、按照法律以判决其是否犯罪或犯罪之輕重可矣、但牛蘭夫婦、始終不受審理、鑽營請託、無理取閙、是直藐視我國之法律、與法爲敵、彼等因聲請管轄及聘外國律師辯護、未蒙允許、而開始絶食、彼等一面表示堅决絶食、一面又接受醫士之診治、則其無必死之决心、而爲恐嚇要挾、已至爲明顯、法院方面、自彼等絶食後、一面盡力開導、一面逐日延醫診治、則法院已盡其應盡之責、如果牛蘭夫婦竟不幸餓死獄中、則亦係彼等自取其咎、法院絶對不負絲毫責任、宋慶齡蔡元培楊杏佛等爲彼等向法院請求暫准保釋、彼等堅持必須送入上海之醫院、拒絶在本京之醫院診治、更爲無理取閙、蓋彼等因絶食而發生疾病、乃咎由自取、且因絶食而發生之疾病、本京醫院中如中央醫院·鼓樓醫院等、均設備完善、足可診治、何必一定赴上海之醫院、而始能診治、測其用意、無非藉此用强力壓迫法院、而達到其移轉管轄聘請外籍律師之目的、司法當局、因此憤然辭職、此種精神、深足爲吾人欽佩、蓋司法當局所爭者、爲維護法律、因維護法律而敝屣尊榮、以去就力爭、實足爲我國政治界放一異彩、我國之司法政値萌芽時代、亟須維護其獨立之精、神且治外法權、正須積極收回、將來外國人犯罪者、均須受我國法律之審判、如此時對一無國籍之危害民國犯、而放弛法律、則將來羣起效尤、我國尚有何法律可言、司法之破壞、將不堪設想矣、現値國難時期、外患同憂、相迫而來、所待於國人努力奮鬥挽救危亡者、其途徑不如凡幾、牛蘭夫婦、是否犯罪或犯罪之輕重、由法院依法審判可矣、殊不必斤斤然掀動司法院之軒然大波、如因牛蘭夫婦係一學者、應特别顧惜、則我國之學者及靑年因犯危害民國罪而被判决者、已不知凡幾、輕國人、重外人、未審何理、况牛蘭夫婦、尚須依法審判者乎云云、」言次不勝憤慨之至、（中央社）</p>

<p>岡崎訪俞　共同委員日委岡崎於昨日十一時二十分、至市政府訪晤俞鴻鈞氏、會譚後、岡崎向俞氏詢問、（一）前日D區日軍撤退時、其經過情形、中國方面、是否認爲滿意、（二）日兵撤後、對該區内之日本居留民、請加留意爲之保護、俞氏當時答謂、撤退情形、大致尚好、至居住該區内之日本居留民、我方因責任之所在、自當盡力爲之保護、日方對此點、可無庸慮、</p>
<p>兩廠駐兵　關於公大豐田兩紗廠駐兵之撤退事、我方本擬於上次與D區撤兵事一併提出共同委員會、嗣因日方業將D區駐兵撤退、故遂中止、然對公大豐田兩紗廠、尚未有正式答復、故岡崎於談及前各點後、即向俞宣示之關於公大豐田兩紗廠之駐兵、係保護該處日人之財產、人數每一紗廠内不過二三十名、且祇限於駐紮屋内、不得外出、日方雖以爲該兩處於一月二十八日以前、即有少數日兵駐紮、但日方願與軍事當局磋商從速撤退、希望中國方面略加體諒、俞氏聆言後、即向岡崎聲述、如日方此語係屬誠意、則中國方面、當加以體諒、請於最近期中、能得日方之誠意答復、否則自當提出共同委員會、至十一時五十分、岡崎乃辭出、</p>
<p>共會任務　關於共同委員會之辦理結束事宜、據新聲社記者昨訪該會負責人、探悉該會根據中日停戰協定、因尚有公大豐田兩紗廠日兵、尚未撤退、故認爲工作未畢、尚須待至相當時期、方可開會辦理結束、記者因詢以日方對公大豐田兩紗廠究有無表示撤退日期、發言人謂、日方對此認爲渠有權駐紮於以上兩紗廠、惟華方則要求其必須撤退、是以共會之結束期、尚非目前可實現者也、又據另一發言人談、依照停戰協定、公大豐田兩紗廠、必須撤退、日方雖有久駐之意、但此事實所難能、蓋共同委員會之結束、必須日兵完全撤退恢復一二八以前原狀、故公大豐田兩紗廠、日兵未撤退、自不能認爲已恢復一月二十八以前日兵原狀也、</p>

<h3>錢中甫談南洋華僑窘狀</h3>
<p>爪哇糖運華銳减</p>
<p>中國貨被日掠奪</p>
<p>滬戰發生後、各業均受影響、而航商尤甚、上海至南洋羣島　路、平時有爪哇糖之運輸、及華僑之往來、較爲起色、今亦營業衰落、滬航商錢冲甫君、特往南洋考查商務、並視察糖業、順便留心僑務事宜、昨已歸國、承告記者爪哇華僑受糖業損失、而有不能立足之勢、此事頗關重要、亟爲轉述如下、</p>
<p>現貨糖無人買　錢君於六月九日動身、至昨日歸國、此行先到望家錫·泗水·三寳龍·井里当·萬隆·茂物·及巴達維亞、凡爪哇通商大埠、均已遍歷、爪哇市面、以糖產爲大宗、十九操在華僑手中、今年滬戰發生、長江又因匪禍不能運糖至内地、加以銀錢業不放欵、而停止辦糖、在四月以後、進口糖稅、每擔徵收銀十三元五角、稅額較糖價大出一倍半、遂致爪哇糖市、竟無市價、現時存積現貨、達二百萬噸以上、</p>
<p>甘蔗田放火燒　自三月至今、爪哇經營糖業華僑行號、受此空前打擊、紛紛倒閉、未閉者僅留兩家、爪哇之甘蔗田、亦以華僑所有者居多、本年甘庶成熟時、以糖無去路、多不願收刈造糖、蓋每擔須虧耗十餘元也、錢君在爪哇時、適華僑將田内所植甘庶、議决放火燒毀、烈燄騰空、數日里不絶、</p>
<p>出口貨被日奪　中國出口貨到爪哇者、以布疋與荳子爲最大宗、今此兩項營業、已爲日人奪去、蓋東三省被占後、荳子從大連運到爪哇、而疋頭則從日本裝往、據爪哇各處華僑領袖語錢君、在國外僑民、無强有力政府之保護、在在受人侮辱、祖國内辭不絶、在外僑民、無立足之地、現在爪哇華僑商業、十八九爲日人奪去、</p>
<p>僑民歸國日多　爪哇華橋、共有一百餘萬、多爲粤閩籍、上海與山東人不過一千名、本來南洋羣島勢力、盡操華人、本年滬戰發生後、糖業衰落、在爪哇華僑、近四個月中、祇有歸國、而無入境、即間有前往、亦屬最少數、如果國内不能統一、再起内戰、爪哇華僑將無立足之點矣、錢羣又言爪哇地無曠蕪、市無竊盜、公路甚修闊、夜間可不閉户、而絶無失竊等事、蓋境内不許容留無職業之外人也、</p>

<h3>司法部將修正滬特區法院協定</h3>
<p>使成一純粹中國法院</p>
<p>不受外人之牽掣拘束</p>
<p>新聲社云、本埠公共租界特區地方法院、係前臨時法院改組者、該院成立之初、因自外人手中收回、故與各有關係國訂立恊定、明年四月、恊定期滿、司法行政部準備進行修正恊定、使不再受外人之拘束、而成爲一純粹之中國法院、新聲社記者、昨赴該法院探詢、茲將所得消息、分誌如下、</p>
<p>法院迥溯　滬特區法院最初設於遜淸、名會審公廨、專訊理公共租界内發生華人案件、及華洋案件、彼時審判者、由華員及領事合審、然大權則操之於華員、自革命軍起、民國成立、於是該公廨之正審判員滿人某宵夜遁去、廨中無負責者、遂由工部局接管、并將廨中職員之欠薪、一律發淸、而斯時大權、遂淪於洋人手中、嗣後一切審判、均惟領事是聽、其間時有破壞我國法律之精神、陷成畸形的司法機關、雖經我方當局力爭收回、終無效果、</p>
<p>初步收回　民國十五年、彼時尚在孫傳芳時代、迭派員與各國領事商洽、實行接收　果、於次年（十六年）實行接收、改組爲臨時法院、期爲三年、其組織如會審公廨時代、僅審判權則操之於我華方推事之手、然遇捕房解來及華洋案件、則仍有陪審領事出庭陪審判决之時、除推事批示外、尚須經外籍領事之簽字、而一切逮捕及偵審之權、仍操之於捕房、我方所收回者、僅一部妥之審判權而已、彼時定期爲三年期滿、再作進一步之改組、</p>
<p>目下現狀　民國十九年、臨時法院之規定期滿、於是再由司法行政部派徐謨等、爲接收委員、迭與各國領事商訂改組恊定、至四月一日、恊定成立、改組爲特區地方法院、臨時法院之第二審案件受理機關、原爲上訴院、茲則改組爲高等法院第二分院、而内部之一切、較臨時法院時爲進步、各種審判權、完全爲我方辦理、其與前特異之點、爲領事　審制之取消、騐屍所之收回、尚有不及中國純粹法院者、卽警務上之權利、均操之捕房、警務人員、均由捕房保舉之、法院雖有檢察處、然因恊定之關係、祇有刑法一零三條至一八六條、方由檢察官偵查起訴、其餘諸條則仍由捕房辦理、</p>
<p>進行修正　最近司法行政部因特院恊定、將於明年四月一日期滿、現準備期滿時、向各有關係國進行商議修正恊定、昨據該法院書記官畏完謙談、對於恊定之修正、司法行政部尚未有命令至此、大致將來修正時、第一步爲警權使法院得能指揮便利、不受牽掣、其他則爲檢察權之行使等、使成爲一純粹之中國法院、</p>
<p>根本問題　記者嗣又往訪該院某高級當局、據謂恊定期滿後、對於恊定之修正、自當進行、警權亦爲一重要問題、然此事之根本、尚在收回租界、因目下法院中之司法警察、雖由外人任用、爲數　少、祇有二十餘人、將來卽使收回、亦僅二十餘人、而出外搜查逮捕處處須受捕房之恊助、法院不能直接指揮云、</p>

<h3>徐廣德論廢兩改元</h3>
<p>我國幣制條例、早於民國三年頒佈施行、在理國幣應以銀元爲本位幣、時至今日、不應再有所謂廢兩改元一種問題、然事實方面、上海一埠、用規元爲計算貨幣本位、其勢力遠駕乎銀元之上、沿江沿海各埠、因上海貿易勢力之轉移、亦幾認規元爲一種不可缺少之計算本位、本年春夏之交、忽因種種關係、銀元市價已由七錢三分跌至六錢八分左右、一般金融界頗思挽此頽局、僉主乘此時機、毅然廢兩改元、并與中央當局互相磋商進行步驟、以期實現由此觀之、其動機實爲挽救銀元之市價、免致再跌、而其實踐之目的、則爲統一幣制、辦法正當、無可　議、今所欲討論者、並非應否改革問題、乃是改革中之利害問題、查規元旣是一種虚本位、其所具之流通勢力、所以能歷久不變者、必有其存在之原因、拙見以爲規元之所以能歷久維持其流通勢力於我國最大之商埠者、不外以下三種原因、（一）上海各界對於沿用規元之習慣根深蒂固、（二）上海一般金融界居間人、對於銀兩有特殊利害關係、（三）歷來政府對於整理幣制、力量簿弱、無一貫政策、今請就以上三點加以說明、并貢末議、殆亦爲廢兩改元聲中之一種研究資料也、</p>
<p>（一）上海沿用規元之習慣　夫規元能在上海商務上佔極大勢力者、一則因國際匯兌上、沿用規元爲上海本位幣、歷時已近八十年、距今七十六年以前、上海一埠所作貨幣、并無規元名稱、其時華洋貿易、多用外國貨幣、其流行最廣者則爲西班牙及墨西哥（卽　洋）銀元兩種、初以西班牙銀元流行最廣、迨後西班牙銀元逐漸减少、現貨旣少、市價升水日高、與墨洋相較、後竟升水至四成左右、於是上海各行商於西歷一八五六年、將西班牙銀元、由硬貨幣改作記賬貨幣、卽名規元、市面流通之硬幣、均用墨洋、當時墨洋一元値西班牙七角二分四厘三毫、卽照此比例、規定墨洋一元、値規元七錢二分四厘三毫、是故上海之有兩種單位貨幣、卽由一八五六年開端、迄今將近八十年規元雖屬一種虚本位幣、而其信用能永久維持不　者、尚有兩種原因、甲、現銀準備、乙、錢莊之信用力、關於甲點、因爲規元是一種虚本位貨幣、苟有相當之銀塊準備、不　其成色重量參差不齊之缺點、其爲習慣上之一種向心力、一旦習慣變更、當無何種困難、關於乙點、通常銀塊準備、包括　銀及大條銀兩種、不到市面收解規元十分之一、餘多賴錢莊票之信用、維持周轉、</p>
<p>（二）金融界居間人之特殊利害關係　錢莊方面對於兩元并用、其最大利益似乎在二毫半之手續費、是項費用、由每次折合上計算、爲數甚鉅、一旦廢兩改元、則必完全犠牲矣、又如錢莊莊票、向來爲上海進口貿易流通最廣之信用貨幣、華商銀行所出本票之勢力、遠不及莊票之受人歡迎、一則圖然以錢莊爲無限責任之組織、然一部份原因、則錢莊莊票、來源甚遠、社會一般信仰力、旣認莊票可以代表規元、一旦規元廢去、銀行本票之流通力、或亦因之增加、錢業方面在業務上、或另受一種影響、在外國銀行方面、向來以規元爲國際匯兌之標準幣、今若廢兩用元、本無重大關係、但匯兌上旣少一種虚本位貨幣、較　未改革時之有規元銀元之兩種折合機會、收付手續方面、少去一種手續費、此爲規元存在與居間商有特殊利害關係之大概情形、</p>
<p>（三）政府對於整理幣制力量薄弱無一貫政策講到政府方面、製造銀幣由中央辦理、所有造幣廠　　中央管轄、對於成色重量、如果認眞辦理、未始不可將銀元完全統一、從前反對廢兩改元、在洋商方面所持之理由、以中央政府勢力薄弱、各省造幣廠各处自製造、不相統一、銀元一旦旣爲各國貨幣匯兌上之單位、倘本位幣成色及重量上稍有參差、必致影響國際貿、易此項理由、現在已不能成立、因實際上我國銀幣已悉照幣制條例所規元之標準成色辦理、但尚有應待斟酌者、我國現有硬幣、究屬有若干流行在市、財政部雖無切實統計發表、據一般人推測、約十七萬萬元、設使此數正確、是否濟用、尚屬問題、倘硬貨幣不足、濟之以紙幣、必得統一發行權、嚴定準備金方法、否則恐有濫發紙幣等事端發生、影響到銀本位之健全方面、</p>
<p>以上三點總括說起來、上海爲全國金融之中心點、歷來銀洋兼用、已數十年、一般社會明知是一種畸形式的貨幣、但旣習慣成自然、一旦廢除、在過渡中當然有多少不方便處應稍忍痛苦、贊成其事、錢業方面亦應體察現代潮流趨勢、毅然放棄銀兩銀元匯劃上之特殊利益、與政府及本國銀行界通力合作、俾達銀元統一之目的、至於政府方面、更應從速督促上海造幣廠實現開工製幣、以期永久維持銀元之標準成色、用重量、一方面將各省造幣廠若天津南京杭州等廠、劃作中央造幣分廠、或設法歸併、以期統一、同時亟須取締濫發紙幣、以免發生幣制上不健全之狀態、</p>

<p>今夫兩元並用之害、已盡人知之、盡人能言之、廢兩改元之益、與廢兩改元之不容稍緩、亦盡人知之、盡人能言之、奚　述焉、茲之所欲言者、處目前環境之下、而言廢兩改、元卽使如願以償、其所得之利、果敵所蒙之害否耶、夫揠苗助長、昔人所　、今之所爲、果能免於揠苗助長之議否也、深願各界人士平心靜氣、有以討論之也、今之主張立時廢兩改元者、豈不曰厘價日跌、市面日　、將以廢兩改元、振興貿易、福利民生焉、夫然、則若英美日本、固皆　法優良之邦也、美且以多金著聞世界、金本位屹立不搖、何以不景氣亦彌温全國、按經濟衰落、原因複雜、就我國論、農村之衰敗、民生之憔悴、天災人禍之流行、内亂外侮之交迫、均有以致之、顧非廢兩改元所能救濟、或曰、邇來各國方主張擴充信用、澎脹通貨、視爲療治不景氣病之惟一　方、如英蘭銀行等之一再减低金利增加放欵、如美國各有力方面力主鼓鑄銀幣發行無準備之紙幣、其目的即在澎脹通貨、俾物價得以上漲、人民購買力得以提高、產銷得以適合、而後經濟乃能逐漸恢復原狀、今若吾國一旦廢兩改元、則銀元之流通愈廣紙幣之發行愈多、籌碼充斥、通貨澎脹具與各國救濟不景氣方案異途同歸、應之曰、是　不明我國救濟組織也、今日中國之地位、與用金本位諸國適成反比例、不患生產過剩、而患過少、不患物價低落而患高漲、誠以連年天災人禍、畎畝荒蕪、金價奇昂、百物騰貴、加以一二八之後、瘡　滿目、元氣凋喪、欲求休養生息、首在節縮通貨、而非擴張通貨、降低物價、而非抬高物價、是以各國之救濟不景氣方案、在我國適成爲自殺政策、學我者死、天下事豈能輕易效　者哉、最近有江君　　在申報發表一文（見七月十一十二日申報）題曰「廢兩改元今尚何待、」對於時賢顧慮廢兩改元後紙通貨將因之膨脹之說、認爲不能成立、並引上海諸銀行之發行額與查倉單爲證、以爲現下一般紙幣之發行準備均甚充足、不虞跌價、關於此點、吾人以爲應分作兩個問題研究、卽目下通貨是否有膨脹之必要、廢兩改元之結果、是否助成通貨之膨脹爲一問題、通貨膨脹後之紙幣準備、將如何規定、目下四六準備制與各發行銀行之公開檢查辦法是否認爲盡善盡美、無懈可擊、政府有無控制全國發行之權力、能否不再蹈昔年平漢之覆轍爲又一問題、按目下内地現洋一無用途源源向商業中心地集中、津滬平漢、均感籌碼過剩之痛苦、物價高漲、實坐是因、故通貨之亟須節縮而不宜膨脹、乃顯明之事實、若於斯時貿然廢兩改元、則造幣廠勢必積極鼓鑄新幣、以應功令、同時各地銀兩一旦失其通貨效用、自必紛紛送入造幣廠、改鑄銀圓、是銀圓之數量當然日益增加而人民復因現金行使之不便、爭取紙幣、於是發行銀行（包括外商銀行在内）勢必乘機積極擴充發行額、以應需要、而通貨之膨脹、遂一發而莫遏、目前奉票之不可收拾、粤鈔之兎起鶻落、彰彰在人耳目、至於昔年平漢之事至今談者猶爲色變、考當時漢口諸行、準備均皆按法定辦理、無如迫於環境力難反抗、卒成停兌之局、而此次一二八之變、東南各地、迭起擠兌風潮、當時事態之嚴重、吾人當未健忘、今後設不幸重生事變、設不幸重蹈平漢覆轍、其爲禍之烈、自必什百倍於疇昔、前其數量更巨、而流布之區域愈廣也、故在政治未臻淸明、發行權未曾統一之前措施偶一不愼、卽足貽社會無窮之禍、夫因噎廢食、固屬不可、明知故犯又豈得計、此從容考量實有必要者也、</p>
<p>更就銀幣之成色立論、目下種類龐雜、成色參差、卽以總理新幣言、亦覺成色不一、欲謀廢兩改元、必須集中造幣、權嚴訂新幣成色、勤加化騐、妥爲監督、毋使成色參差、而後新幣之信用始克樹立、一面予人民以自由鑄造之機會、則新幣之行使、乃能遠近無阻、或曰、此事目下上海造幣廠已優爲之、奚鰓鰓爲、不知此非有强有力之中樞、令出惟行、使各省各地、俯首聽命、不敢稍挾異見不可、不然者、造幣權仍無集中之可言、循至省自爲政以昔日濫鑄銅元者、進而濫鑄銀元行使市面、其結果有不忍言者、吾人之主張出以愼重者、正爲此耳、</p>
<p>時人論廢兩改元、必抨　銀兩不遺餘力、投井落石、是乃國人慣技、吾人雅不欲作違心之論、試思數十年來、迭經巨刼、市面屢起風波、然而恐慌終於消、弭市面卒免崩潰者、未始不隱受兩元並用下兩重準備之賜、復因華洋貿易、大小契約、債權債務、多以銀兩爲準、故歷年銀元成色、縱有高下、紙幣縱有風潮、而物價無形中實爲之穩定不少、吾人觀於各省濫鑄銅元之結果、致銅元價格一落千丈、於是以銅元計値之日用物品、價格大漲、彼貧苦小民、收入以銅元爲標準者、生計乃大感困難、雖其收入亦可要求增加、然其增加之速度、决不能如物價上漲之迅且疾、故在某一時期内所受痛苦實難形容猶幸社會多數人士、因收入均爲銀元、而銀元又以銀兩爲後盾、故能不受影響、今若一旦廢兩改元、彼實値與面値相等之銀兩、旣因此消滅、則銀幣之成色與紙幣之準備、設或發生問題、卽以銀元計値之凡百貨物、爲彌補損失起見、自必狂漲、斯時整個社會所起之騒擾、殆將不堪設想、而經濟組織崩裂潰决、陷人民於水深火熱之中、尤在意中然則施行之前、可不審愼考慮者哉、（未完）</p>

<p>我國自提倡新敎育以來、數十年於茲矣、成效如何、識者自有公評、毋待予之喋喋、　人聽聞、且作者並非專家、偶有鑑及、亦未敢遽作皮相之談、致遭方家之譏、惟十餘年來、鑒於學校當局之所謂提倡體育、及一般大中學之主體育行政者、其措置之失當、與夫誤入岐途之危機、不特貽害靑年於一時、兼且危及國本、　喪民族、常此遷延、後患堪虞、茲者敎育部行將有全國體育會議之召集、對於學校體育、定多改革之處、予不敏、敢將平素所見、與夫一般大中學學校當局與主體育行政者、一述過去之錯誤、曁今後之亟宜改絃更輒者數端於後、藉供芻蕘於全國專家會議之前、掛漏之見、幸希敎之、</p>
<p>（一）師資時虞缺乏、政府宜設專校以全國學校數量論、體育敎師之支配、不論其質與量、俱感欠缺、流弊所至、非材不稱職、卽濫竽充數、浸淫而成今日不倫不類之體育現狀、而學校當局不察也、祗須得一有虚名、有頭銜之人物、充當一校之體育主政者、措置之適當與否、提倡之普遍與否、不計也、亦不問也、而其所求者、祇在吾校之是否能得某項錦標某項獎品、而自詡於衆曰、此吾校體育之發達也、此吾校提倡之得宜也、吁甚矣、當局者之誤解體育也如此、體育行政者之設施措置也又如彼、宜乎初出茅廬之運動員也、忽然一躍而爲大學體育主任矣、足球健將也、籃球明星也、幾無往而不可充大中學體育敎授、吁、甚矣、以此而欲望當今學校體育之提倡得其道也、不亦難矣、揆其情理其弊不在運動員與夫一般明星健將、而在政府之不能多設體育專科學校、廣造人材、分佈全國、而學校當局之祗圖虚名、不諳實際之提倡、亦爲罪無可　之一事、</p>
<p>（二）經濟須有的欵支配尤宜適當今學校當局之視體育也、以之作爲招搖品者有之、以之作爲　瘤品者亦有之、前者其爲害造成學校運動員之特殊階級、後者養成一般風流自賞之文弱少年、曠觀全國各校不聘體育敎師、不以體育爲必修科目、無運動塲、無體育設備者、比比皆是、當局者之唯一託辭、無不曰受經濟影響、而學業與身體之關係、靑年與民族之前途、均非顧及、以此而言學校敎育、不亦重可悲乎、尚望今後學校當局、在不論何種困難環境之下、力去此弊、確定學校體育經費、提倡體育、培養民族原氣、爲國家樹百年之基、則幸甚矣、然更有言者、一般不名一文於提倡體育者、固屬不當、而濫用大宗欵項於運動選手學校、亦屬不宜、蓋有多數大學及中學、　用其　面提倡之方法、徵收全體學生體育經費每年若干元、盡量耗費於少數選手身上、而置多數學生於不顧、此種運動員特殊訓練、　夫上多數人所出之代價、供少數人享用之　度實爲提倡體育之厲階、致於此種流弊發生、尤爲學校體育主政者之亟宜猛省　改進者、夫曰學校提倡體育、　宜有的欵、但支配務求平均　當、尤須與取之於衆、用之於衆之原則相吻合、</p>

<h3>大言炎炎</h3>
<p>九工老人馬相伯</p>
<p>吾生平死過三四回，（請參閱五月二十二日本欄相老之四不死）記得有一次，四歲，出痘子，小棺材都預備好了，下棺材的衣服都穿好了，吾的父親剛在外邊回來，抱了吾的身體號啕大哭，不知麽樣吾忽然聽到父親的哭聲，就猛然覺醒，嗚咽地說道：</p>
<p>「吾不死，吾要立了功勞再死！」</p>
<p>這句話驟看起來，好像很卑鄙，其實不然，吾幼時想立功勞，無非已認淸人生在世，必須做些事業，决無升官發財的夢想。這種純潔的。好爲人上人的念頭是從宗敎的素養得來。這種宗敎的素養是宗敎的家庭所賦給的。吾因爲有了宗敎的家庭，宗敎的環境，天天聽到宗敎的道理，從小心境就很偉大，開出口來，也不免大言炎炎了。</p>
<p>人說宗敎是愚的。其實狂則有之，愚未必也。文人嗜酒，必是要喝得大醉，醉得雲天霧地，像發狂一般，才後有好詩寫出來。宗敎家信仰堅决，於是誠之所至，金石爲開，旁人看來，好像愚蠢，吾則自認發狂。</p>
<p>有了發狂一般的信仰，然後可以成爲宗敎家！同樣，有了發狂一般的信仰，然後可以成爲學問家。世間不知多少學問家，都是發了狂然後成功的。吾對於宗敎有了發狂一般的信仰，所以對於科學也就有了發狂一般的興趣，對於科學始有特殊的興趣啊—</p>
<h3>滬西讌集記</h3>
<p>— 陸鏡淸</p>
<p>滬西徐滙一帶。濃蔭如　。夏景尤宜。綠野幽　。水木明瑟。俊侶同車。携尊載酒。亦賞心樂事也。蛟川李雲老。邇自錦州言旋。朱丈子橋。方由經原返斾。前昨招集鷗盟。讌飮於白眉寓邸。（徐滙西郊）熊鳳凰·黄抱一·李祖紳·殷汝驪·諸丈。亦翩其來遊。軒車戾止。舊雨今雨。酒星文星。魚魚雅雅。滿座生春。聯裾接　。適符登灜之數。披襟憑欄。堪娱挹勝之情。時則卓午蔭淸。　風解慍。遠眄梵渡　涇。蒼妍入畫。龍華古塔。似延頸相窺。四圍翠色。盡　茜紗窗下矣。俄而酒炙紛綸。刀叉繽錯。蔌肴。斟桂　。談高趣逸。體曠心怡。相與綢繆家國。商榷古今。洒冰雪之胸懷。吐雲霞之意氣。　龍炙　。樂且未央。益以昭席花枝。秀助樽罍之色。堆盤雪　。甘同瓊玉之漿。晚菘早韮。鄉味淸腴。香荔蜜蘋。山珍稠疊。紫茄靑豆。同增齒頰之芬芳。素鴨　　。亦等文章之火候。厥味　醰。足快朶顧矣。蓋監廚之雲老。靑磬紅魚。素耽禪悅。並以老　自謙。固雅擅易七鹽梅之術者。（李氏雇有名廚）侈非何允。精甚韋邭。旣香旣潔，彷茅氏之天廚。必約必精。遵伯廬之家訓。以是投轄留賓。有不勝鼠飮者。按是日酒席。由雲老飭菜根香素食館承辦。掌廚楊氏。倭奴曾　金（每月）毛詩之數。聘往櫻島。蜚聲一時。近頃返國。爲該館司鼎鼐。調羹妙手。人譽其才。席間佳肴。以棗泥銀耳。七　甘露」翡翠粥。香雪菜諸品。尤爲來賓嘖嘖稱賞。桃花潭水。倍憶深情。祇蔬笋之類。合熊魚之美。熟謂素食太簡。菜根味淡耶。</p>
<p>相老人於座次。躬携民治手稿傳觀。羣推崢　宏論。將從事於棗梨。當揚芬於荃　。斯文所繫。一髮千鈞。吾道不孤。寸心萬古。超超元箸。當如佳肴之膾炙人口也。酒過半。相老人已酡顏薄醉。與雪　相映。樂麈尾以談玄。忘駒陰之移　。尚復滔滔妙緒。娓娓如珠。興　之餘。不覺　然其　。玉山頽矣。李雲老與朱子老容采。粗有虎賁中郎之似。雲鶴朱霞。翛然雅度。所戴國產笠帽雙纓下垂。古意盎然。缅懷江山黯淡。爱國淚多。抑示老成提倡之意歟。熊秉老年來息影香山。董理慈幼事業。銀髯如戟。垂垂老矣。寒潭秋月。彷彿淸標。自頃淞湄暫駐。悉心於紅卍字會。席示暇暖。東平好善。曠世罕儔。迨酒闌時。對於拙作文畫小册題贈「高尚純潔」四字。子老亦惠題「胸貯五岳。」雖零縑碎錦。彌足珍也。及乎嘉賓臨别。聯翩上平台去。相老如昨宵酒醒。亦扶筑而來。相與攝影數幀。聊存鴻爪。所以誌雅集之紀念。示古歡之不忘云爾。</p>
<h3>駱亮公之死</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>蜀中名士駱亮公。於日前殁於滬寓。聞者惜之。公體碩而微髭。健於談。發聲宏響。固壽者相。今乃未届耄耋。而溘然長逝。非所料也。公　年曾參吳禄貞將軍戈幕。運籌帷幄。將軍深倚重之。將軍年少翩翩。未免風流自賞。頗涉聲色之好。公力諷勸。不以上峯而稍事媚悅。將軍亦以其剛直正大。而憚避之。彷彿嚴子陵之與漢光武。大有微公不能成將軍之高。微將軍豈能遂公之高之概。公晚年好讀經典。所譚均妙有禪機。又嗜　蘖成癖。量極宏博。一日。有友招之飮五十年之陳醪者。發醅香氣濃郁。公大喜。連傾數觥。友阻之。謂陳醪不宜多飮。多飮則泥醉不易醒。不如淺嘗適可之爲得。公以爲友之吝酒也。不之聽。又進若干盞。微醺始止。及席散辭歸。時方嚴冬。朔風襲裾。凛然而寒。且頭眼暈眩。幾仆於地。勉力支持。雇車抵寓。病三日始瘳。乃信友言之不我欺。而知貪杯勺之爲害。戒酒月餘。有貽以杜製之玫瑰釀數瓶。又復狂飮如故。公素善書。醉後所作。更神化入妙。海上諸素餚館中。常有其楹帖手蹟也。予識公。且慕公書法。因循未之求。茲欲求之而無從矣。可知天下事往往因因循而坐失。不僅求書之微末已也。公篤於伉儷情。去歲其夫人病卒。公哭之慟。從此鬱鬱寡懽。體魄遂日益疲　。今夏一病而死。殆神傷所致歟。公身後殊蕭條。子嗣又穉幼。深願藝林同志。有以恤助之也。</p>
<h3>八哥能言記後·錢·小·山</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>八哥能作抗日口號。義矣。因憶宋詩人林霽山集中。有詠秦吉了一首。注　南有畜秦吉了者。能作人語。夷酋欲以錢十萬　買之。其人告以貧。將賣爾。秦吉了曰。我漢禽也。不願入夷中。遂勁而死。今之八哥。可與秦吉了先後媲美。賦詩張之。</p>
<p>八哥抗日聽頻呼。可以人而竟不如。千古並轉秦吉了。漢禽終不作夷奴。</p>
<h3>消夏漫談</h3>
<p>— 濟翔</p>
<p>友人某君。曩年曾在都下購得石子一。色作淡紅。初視了無異處。及置水中。則水中呈蟹足影八。麗石而生。固儼然一蟹也。更取而諦視之。則仍是一石耳。絶不究其足影何來。眞可異已。友人又言。某君得一石。中有美人。手抱琵琶。風姿曼妙。若隱若現。直是鬼斧神工。價比連城之璧焉。</p>
<p>余家藏有刻竹筒一事。徑約三寸餘。高五寸。上刻人物凡十餘事。皆漏雕。各人面目動作。神情畢肖。栩栩如生。不知何處出品。亦甚可寳也。</p>
<p>遜淸某桐城派文家。好與其生徒月旦當時作家優劣。至於下品。輒曰。是文佳則佳矣。惜乎高山聞鼓。諸生不解所謂。進問何指。某曰。高山聞鼓。其聲不通不通也。諸生皆爲莞爾。</p>
<p>近在某處。見熊秉三先生自書念奴嬌詞一首云。「雙峯殘照。看樓台爭聳。萬門千户。太息東南民力盡。依舊湖山歌舞。遠聽江潮。胥濤怒吼。總爲私仇訴。獨餘孤柏巍巍。精忠千古。曾記勾踐君臣。臥薪嘗胆。忍力全疆土。绝代佳人能助國。愧殺男兒無數。敵勢方張。廷爭未息。又見金兵渡。國魂安在。域中今竟誰主。」蓋游西湖作也。家國之憂。溢於詞表。</p>
<h3>摩登女子</h3>
<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>—上海像贊之二—</p>
<p>我在素稱交際家的雲那兒無意間得到了一個女子的片段日記。雲在上面寫了這樣六個字：「摩登女子日記」；我不懂雲的意思；茲抄錄於後，讓大家評評這個理：</p>
<p>「昨天和小王約好，今天下午二時上我家來一起去看影戲。誰知道一直等到兩點半小王還没有來；我眞氣極了：小王没有錢請我看影戲，其實我也可以請小王的，也用不着不來啊；哼，若不是小王的臉蛋子漂亮，恐怕誰也不稀罕這個窮小子吧。</p>
<p>「到了兩點三刻我可眞忍耐不住了，才打算換衣服去找小王，出我意外的老陳來了。一個人的姓名上面有了一個『老』字，就是瞎子也知道這個人的尊容該是多麽老而醜了。但老陳有錢。在這個年頭兒，我們靑年女子爲了某種的需要，漂亮的少年固然不能缺少，可惜他們窮的多；所以有了鬍子的富男人就不妨有這麽一兩個，免得經濟上發上恐慌。我對於小王和老陳的態度。就是這個意思。現在老陳來了，雖有點兒討厭他，但不能冷淡他。他說，他特來請我去看影戲。我裝做很快樂的樣子答應了他的要求。</p>
<p>「我把我的動人的新裝全藏起來，只穿了一件不時髦的衣服。我故意的在着衣鏡前照了又照；一會兒皺眉頭，一會兒嘆聲氣。他催我快些兒。我說衣服太寒蠢，不去了。他就說道：『那末，我們先去剪衣料。』我心裏當然快樂極了，可是臉上還保持着怏怏不樂的樣兒。乘了他的大Buick車子，到了永安公司。我揀貴重的衣料剪了三百多塊錢。他仍是微笑着，嘴裏含着的雪茄烟的灰都不落下來，一點兒也不在意。</p>
<p>「這時有一個手指上戴着一個金鋼鑽戒子的女人，也在剪衣料：我以貪　的眼光注視着伊的金鋼鑽戒子。老陳眞伶俐，眞聰明，他猜着了我的心思，便笑着對我說道：『曼，我們也去買一個吧。』我並没開口，只望著他很嫵媚的一笑。我們又到了烏利文洋行。我也不知道這是一個幾克拉的金鋼鑽戒子，反正價錢很貴就是了。老陳簽那張一千三百塊錢的支票的時候，他的手指一點兒也不顫動。</p>
<p>「我們在國泰大戲院看完了『馬戲之花』以後，便一起上立道飯店吃晚飯。我恐怕小王在家裏等我，隨便吃了一點兒，藉口頭痛，要回家睡覺。他就用車子送我回家。在半路上，他用手摟著我的腰，想和我接吻。我拒絶掙扎的當兒，右手碰著一包衣料，左手的金鋼鑽戒子的光芒射進眼簾中。就不拒絶了：他以一千六百多塊錢買了一個吻去。………」</p>
<h3>談福建肉鬆</h3>
<p>— 阿絜</p>
<p>昨碧城君在自由談撰『肉鬆創始之述聞』。略謂肉鬆創始於太倉倪鴻順。今雖上海商埠之廣大。賣肉鬆者。亦且掛倪鴻順之老牌。猶之老三珍陸稿荐之醬鴨醬肉。非用此牌號。不足以標高貴之格云。又謂肉鬆製法。有特殊秘訣。據云須用蛇油。可使日久不壞。儲於器中。無庸抽去空氣。與今之罐頭食物相同矣。以予所知。肉鬆各地皆產。而以福州所製爲最佳。今日海上盛行之肉鬆。厥唯福州之鼎日有肉鬆。未聞太倉倪鴻順之負盛名也。福建肉鬆。質鬆味鮮。入口即融。色綘而油。鮮美亡可倫比。爲下酒雋品。若裏麥餅食之。尤覺别有風味。六七年前。愛多亞路孟納拉路有閩人所設『賽有天』者始出售福建鼎日有肉鬆。每罐售價一元二角。較閩地之價。昂至十分之二。海上多富人。初不以價高爲意。是以營業蒸蒸日上。有供不應求之勢。今則街頭寄售之家。比比皆是。然眞正鼎日有出品。實不易觀。而售價亦漸低矣。實則福州肉鬆之特點。在於製時多　豬肉。故味鮮而富于油分。以蛇油製成。可免抽去空氣。實屬讕言。不論蛇油之不易得。藉曰有之。詎有防腐之功。何足信哉。</p>
<h3>碎語</h3>
<p>— 流沙</p>
<p>小姐！我謹以至誠，勸你别再對着鏡子自艾你容顏的醜惡，你可也别要怨恨你的愚笨，你的醜惡和愚笨喲，便將是你的幸福。小姐！你知道金甲蟲嗎？他在草莽間吃着露水是多麽自由喲！但是當办們發現他有一副金甲，他便被人拘捕着玩弄了，這拘捕呵是說明人是在愛着他。同樣，人愛着玫瑰花便將玫瑰花折下了。美呵！愛呵！算了吧</p>
<p>主婦和婢女不同的地方是主婦貪懶一點，婢女刻苦一點，但是這社會懶是美德，愈懶將愈被人尊敬的。</p>
<p>某機關裏的小職員對小學敎師的氣燄是將把瘦小的人壓死的那麽足，原因不過是每月多領二十塊大洋的薪金。</p>
<p>當代立法院某大人，身穿馬掛長過膝，腰間漢玉數枚，儀表與衆不同，一日諭小子曰：「不吃鴉片不成官。」</p>
<p>架子要大，謀事不能太巴結，人不來訪毌先訪，架子不在則不尊，謀事太巴結則不成，人不來而先訪者自落身分，—此老師敎余處世之道也，信夫？</p>
<p>古廟敲錄暫停數天。敬希讀者原諒。</p>

<h3>銀洋市無大變更</h3>
<p>市塲情形仍懈昨日雖値星期一、銀行開關、按諸平時情形、銀洋交易必較孔多、但目前　暑時期、買賣人心照例不勁、是以市氣無競爭熱度、價格遂無何種變風、洋厘尤爲穩健、僅在二五之差别、銀根外表仍挺、而内容略似緊張、劃頭頭襯比較缺欠、幸銀行前日有押欵可做、否則不免有緊急可慮耳、</p>
<p>厘拆早午同價「洋厘」早市厘價較前午略好二毫平、爲六錢九分五厘二毫半、午市因供求平匀、故價無上落、仍與早市相同、「銀拆」早午兩市同爲一錢四分、較前午略好一分、劃頭加水居然又有二錢五六分、銀行掛牌六分、</p>

<p>銀收解頗　　昨因銀行開關、收解消息、比較稍多、而收欵又多、故劃頭加水甚昂、頭襯頗爲缺欠、華商各銀行收解票欵三百四五十萬、各種收解六百四十餘萬、押欵交易一百餘萬、進倉八十萬、外商收解票欵二百七八十萬、各種收解七百十餘萬、押欵交易八十餘萬、進倉七十萬、錢莊銀公單收解三千五百餘萬、劃頭欵收解五百二十餘萬、各路匯欵收解八十餘萬、解欵一百餘萬、</p>

<h3>證劵一般債價都見小挫</h3>

<p>變化、故求供甚平、買賣大户進出均稀少、各債劵價以是遂亦陷於盤旋狀態、上落甚微、計全日各債劵多僅有四五角徘徊、較上週末則爲需要冷淡、各略小一二角左右、觀目下之債劵市之形勢、一時實難望發展、暫時或須益見沉靜也、又本年氣候酷熱、遠勝往年、交易所爲辦事便利計、或終將被迫而準照往年成例、而停止下午市一部份交易云、</p>

<p>滬南昨日米市各帮來源寥寥、約抵十餘號、浦存稀少、聞市府　社會局、討論補救辦法、　可樂觀、是以人心轉活、成交較前轉濃、而售意因存貨薄弱、各處　價相差太遠、以致厚　行情又　角外、早薄稻共抵四號、積存零星、　洋尖到銷均細、市無榮辱、變元陰化胃雖不佳、因到貨無幾、且聞閘市轉硬、形高二角、</p>

<h3>標粉初平繼俏</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼俏之象、以洋麥報價曾小三角左右、人心尚懈、惟至二盤後、步步挺　、近期因前週津銷通暢、不免引人注意、遠期月份、聞烟台帮曾有購買、浮多又從而抬高、所以漲度頗銳、廠方之抛售、現已轉寂、因内地麥價、又復回漲、聞無錫高麥、已開至五元三角左右、因此居奇、亦未可知也、結果本月份較前週漲一分、八月份漲一分二厘半、九十月份漲一分七厘半、十一月份漲二分二厘半、十二月份漲三分云、</p>
<h3>本月麥軋空暴跳</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、突呈巨大之變化、本月份因距交割不遠、買方調查市上、願交割者、爲數無多、故有意軋空、頻頻狂收、聞以二十四及　十三號爲最多、致本月份之漲度、竟達一錢之巨、微聞賣方受此打擊、將收羅現貨、預備交割、此說如確、前途將仍有變化也、遠期各月份、亦稍帶起、惟漲度無幾、計八九十月份、各較好三分、現麥市面、高貨步提、中次仍平、　台州麥二兩九錢半、大　來三兩、　淞麥二兩七錢八分、黄渡麥二兩八錢四分、外　麥二兩八錢二分、雙　麥二兩八錢三分、崇明麥二兩七錢二分、太倉麥二兩八錢四分、次至七錢八分、直塘麥二兩九錢、安亭麥二兩七錢九分、共開四千三百包、　新申大華豐信大辦去云、</p>

<h3>高試及格員擬自請取消資格</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>去年高等考試，典禮異常隆重，即其經費一項，聞亦耗費百餘萬之鉅，洵不愧爲國家一件　才大典也。</p>
<p>據昨日京訊「考試院前次高考及格人員，定八月六日舉行年會，擬要求國府嚴厲實行考試及格後之銓叙，否則全體人員，將證書退還考試院，自請取消資格」照這樣看來，諸位高考及格的先生們，尚没有一個銓叙過的，所以此次焦躁起來，要自請取消資格，其實亦可不必，因爲就諸位先生的頭銜而論，國家拿出了百餘萬金錢，舉行了盛大的考試典禮，原不是容易得到的，也應該表示滿意，加以原諒。</p>
<p>本來「朝裏無人莫做官」，原是一句金科玉律的話，倘使你有很大的靠山，即使你没有資格，也自然而然會有官做，反之那怕你有什麽資格，原是没有用處的，所以當高考的時候，我就預料是白費心的，因爲去應高考的先生們，一定後臺没有奥援的，倘然你有了奥援，早已做了官，得了意，决不願再去應試，所以我知道即使錄取，仍舊没有用處，這是一定的道理。</p>
<p>國家的掄才大典，原是裝裝幌子的，請諸位仔細算算，現在政府中，頭等要人有多少，（在野的不算）二等要人多少，三四等要人多少，而諸要人的親戚朋友又有多少，試問共總有幾隻飯碗，那裏還輪得到僅有資格而没有勢力的諸位先生呢？高等考試，業已考過，諸位資格，亦已取得，則國家對於考試一事，也算義務盡了，尚有什麽話說呢。</p>
<p>并且還有一層，假定你有大力者爲後臺老　，則做官比較好做，就是你出些亂子，也可以馬馬虎虎過去，若没有鼎乖乖的後臺老闆，即使你有了官做，也必定不安於位，就是好容易銓叙到了，亦不過數日與數月的官運，包你就要下臺，决不會有飛聲騰達的希望，</p>
<p>但是後臺老闆，也不是一概的，最好有些裙帶的氣味，方有意想不到的效力，其餘的親戚次之，朋友更次之，倘使你要做官麽？對於極重要的要人們，當思如何去發生些裙帶的關係，這原是一條終南大道，資格不資格，不要放在心浪。</p>

<h3>殺蟲消毒及防腐劑</h3>
<p>— 夢</p>
<p>夏日疾病，半由蝨虫之傳染，半由食品之不愼；如能以人工方法，以有効而經濟之藥品，殺却虫豸，而對于食品，則施以相當之消毒及防腐，則微生物自無發展之機會，病源亦因此而斷絶。今以最普通之防腐殺虫等劑，列之于後，亦家庭衛生之一道也。</p>
<p>石炭酸石炭酸溶液，爲極桂之殺蟲劑。惟性極毒，不宜入口目。如用以除蝨或用爲非食品之消毒劑，則頗奏神効。各藥房均有出售，自製則頗繁。</p>
<p>硫磺硫磺殺虫良劑，尤宜于除臭虫，故床板或棕架内，灑以硫横粉末，或塗以硫磺合水之漿糊，臭虫即能絶跡。如爲全室消毒，則然硫磺于室中，使成二氣化硫。若室内空氣乾燥，雖對于蚤蠅等之惡物，毒害其大，可使昆虫之子，斷絶生育；然對于微生物之影響極小。故宜噴霧少許，使室内空氣潮濕，則同時殺菌能力亦增大。大概于一千立方呎内，燃硫磺二三磅，經二十四小時之久，則病菌可完全殺却。故若于因傳染病而死之室内實施以此種消毒爲最宜。</p>
<p>水楊酸爲一有効之防腐劑。因其無毒，故可保存食物，如加少許于食物或漿糊内，（洋漿糊即可以此製成）。可歷久不壞。因其防止菌類繁殖力極强。此物于藥房中，皆有出售，售價極廉。（約二角可用三四十次）如自製，則反複雜而不經濟。</p>
<p>硼酸硼酸水之消毒，盡人皆知。而價又極廉，（通常用以洗眼睛）其殺菌力雖比較甚弱，然防腐力則極强，如以在分硼酸，加一分硼砂，加入牛乳内，可免酸化。通常用于食品，牛油，乳酷中。</p>
<p>以上四種，二爲殺蟲消毒劑，二爲防腐劑。滬上蚊蠅尚少，然常苦于臭虫，初生於松板中，繼則滿佈全室，無法可治，倘以上列之殺虫劑，治之爲効頗速。食品腐化，及不需要之發酵，皆可用以上二種之防腐劑以避免之。如能于家庭烹飪之中，牛乳黄酒之内，加入少許之防腐劑，則可免微虫物之繁殖，使經久不壞。記者曾實地試騐，皆有良好成績，故敢爲讀者告也。</p>

<h3>三的地獄生活</h3>
<p>— 浣花</p>
<p>衖堂一角，别有天地，一位　三先生，便看定了這塊地盤，作爲臨時寄宿舍，地上舖了兩張報紙的衾褥，靠墻的一面，釘上兩根釘，繫着破布條做的繩子，扣牢一塊三尺立方體的舊蔴袋，也算是被頭，也算是帳篷，要算是帳篷的話，只消在睏倒的辰光，面對着墻，將蔴袋向身後一裏，那麽，這頂帳篷便完全宣告成立，好在頭部有個垃圾箱的天然屏風，脚部又安放了個高級帽盒，上面並遮覆着一所過街樓，這個所在，風雨不侵，在　三眼裏看起來，倒也形勢雄美，像座絶妙的安樂窩呢。</p>
<p>三先生日長無事，朝帳篷裏一躺，將自已所最心愛的一副烟具，搬出擺開，就是一根竹桿短槍，一只洋蠟燭頭加上廢電燈泡製成罩子的烟燈，一支鐵絲的針　，在個香烟罐的茶壸，在那裏裝吸人家所棄掉的紅丸灰，消閑取樂，一口復一口，無奈灰並不多，祇得吸進斗去，再從斗裏挖出來，挖了再吸，循回往復，吸個無休無歇。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>等到烟癮過足，便執着那盛餅干的長方洋鐵盒，向衖堂裏的挨户施主，討些殘羹剩飯，大嚼一頓，吃飽了，又向那張特殊的牀舖上一坐，將那件百孔千瘡的短衫脫在手中，對那密如珍珠的　蝨，開始下討伐令，只見他一個一個的拈出，送向嘴裏，像吃炒　豆似的，從伊微笑的表情裏，看出他的津津有味。</p>
<p>另一位　三先生，上身裏着一幅油垢堆滿了的蔴袋，脚下趿着在垃圾堆裏檢來的一雙大小不同的破鞋，頭上亂髮有四五寸長，結作一餅一餅的，手裏捧了一隻磁消見鐵的面盆，做他吃飯的傢具，每天到十二點鐘一敲，他肚皮裏的飢餓，就在自然的告訴他說，現在已是交了午刻，你好往你每日所到的樂園，去等待你的食神降臨了。</p>
<p>他就風雨無阻的，利用他那兩隻腿的汽車，飛奔到這衖堂口來，不一會，一個包飯作裏的夥計，從衖堂一家人家收了盤碗出來，他便似小孩子看見奶娘，狂躍上前，將人家所未曾吃完的飯肴，一古攏兒倒來那隻面盆裏，揀一所較風凉的人家階石上坐着，用那五個指頭做靈便的箸筷，去慢慢的享受，非將留在盆裏的餘汁，都用舌頭舔完，决不肯就此罷休。</p>
<p>隨後便在左近的地上，尋拾着兩個香烟屁股，來燃吸着消消飽悶，有時到了衖堂口，看看辰光還早，就跑到衖堂對面一帶那些人肉市塲的人家；去討幾隻銅板，只要往門口一站，他那身上發出着穢臭的氣息，和那摩登的鹹肉小姐身上香氣一鬥法，她們便情情願願拿出錢來給他，他是没有一次不得到勝利。</p>

<h3>家庭敎育</h3>
<p>— 友如</p>
<p>「乖兒子，别哭！你聽着賣熟小菜的「老甲魚」來了，買五個銅板牛肉給你吃。」母親在阻不住兒子的哭泣時候，拿着這種「預約」作爲兒子止哭的條件。」</p>
<p>「媽媽，老甲魚來了！喊進衖堂來了！銅板呢？快拿來，我自已會買。」兒子狠急迫地，催他娘履行方才的口頭契約。</p>
<p>「胡說！媽那來這許多閑錢，買零食你吃？你要錢不會向你爹要？他自已穿得好，吃得好，還要賭錢，嫖堂子，兒子身上的事，就完全不問信兒！昨兒我還對他說說阿寳的同學，天天逛大世界；看跑狗，頑跳舞塲，白相得多開心，幾時你也學他出去頑一下子，也呌孩子别眼熱人家。那曉得他扳起臉孔，睬都没有睬一聲！」</p>
<p>「媽媽，爹爹爲什麽不睬媽呢？」</p>
<p>唉！好兒子，你那裏曉得你爹的事情？他從有了那個「濫汚婊子」兩家頭打得火一般熱！有了她，還來理你媽作甚？」</p>
<p>「媽媽，不是說，那個鹹肉老三嗎？向來我見子爹，非得駡他一頓替媽媽出口氣！」</p>
<p>「好兒子！我的乖兒子！你的話不錯，這等老子，眞是該駡的？你能這樣孝順媽媽，媽媽一定要買雙外國貨的新皮鞋給你。等你生日到了，好穿起來出風頭！」</p>
<p>諸君！請瞧瞧上面這一段故事，在中國家庭中，不是常常聽得到的？極平常的說話，替牠分析評註起來，至少可以得到下列幾種意義：</p>
<p>（一）說話不必有信用，只要敷衍得眼前。</p>
<p>（二）對于年老的任何人，可以隨便駡他一聲「老甲魚」。</p>
<p>（三）養成孩子吃不衛生的零碎胡亂用錢的習慣。</p>
<p>（四）啓迪孩子們白相游戲塲跑狗塲跳舞場……等知識和引起他們的不良慾望？</p>
<p>（五）使孩子們腦筋中，嵌着「賭錢」「嫖妓」和「濫汚婊子」「鹹肉」……的印象。</p>
<p>（六）引導和獎勵孩子反抗尊長的理性。</p>
<p>（七）皮鞋必要外國貨，至少可以養成孩子們輕視國產重視舶品的心理。</p>
<p>（八）孩子也攷究做生日，更敎他出風頭，這是怕他没有虚榮心，而在切實鼓舞和引導他。</p>
<p>唉！這便是中國的家庭敎育！</p>

<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>他瞧不慣政治舞台上奸詐欺騙的勾留，偷偷的從南京歸來；自以爲神不知鬼不覺的舉動，却當天晚上接到聚餐會的一紙通告丨他們畢業後，聯合幾位志同道合的同學，每月舉行一次聚餐會丨他懷疑他們手段竟如此高妙；遂即換了衣服，對鏡中的淸瘦少年微微一笑，預祝在上海能找到適合他個性的工作。</p>
<p>他按着通告書上的地址，踏上杏花樓，小張似乎一驚，茅盾（因爲他頌拜茅盾）幾時歸來的？</p>
<p>時光還早，只小張一人招呼茶房搬橙排桌，二個久别重逢的老友，略談幾句别後情况，他問起怎樣知道自已回到上海？</p>
<p>「那裏？會裏新近的章程，没有更改地址的信，每月底無論如何，寄通知書去的。」</p>
<p>一霎時，嘉賓滿座，對於他的回來表示特殊歡迎。因爲會裏出版一種雜誌，他有茅盾的雅號，當然於文藝有相當的認識。</p>
<p>酒過數巡，席上的空氣異常濃厚，各人面上露着難得見的微笑，各人忘了現在的生活和在校裏的希望完全相反了。小小酒樓中充滿了靑年的生氣，像幾年前的生活一樣。</p>
<p>談話的方向轉到他的政治生活，因爲在座的同學中，畢畢後上過政治舞台的，祇有他一個。他乾了一杯酒，嘴角露了一絲苦笑說。</p>
<p>「政治舞台像一隻染缸，白的料子都變顏色出來；也像從前的文明戲，貓跳狗呌而已。」他的火也似的眼睛注視在某一點上繼續說「唉！我要是女子，不如賣性去。」</p>
<p>他本是懷疑派，而從南京歸來，言語更奇突，座上的同學當然深知他的性情，都以有聲電影，跳舞塲等話岔了開去。</p>
<p>他問起各人的生活，不是某洋行的小職員，便是小校敎員，想在上海找適合他個性的工作，又給他一個失望。</p>
<p>他悶悶的喝了酒歸途，在東新橋畔聽見，來啦！來啦！」的慘呌。「賣性也這樣不容易嗎？」他自已向着自已，踏着瘦長的影子歸寓，想着一句格言「要吃飯，非腐化不可！而奸詐欺騙，正是腐化的工作步驟！」</p>

<h3>踏出校門</h3>
<p>— 毓賢</p>
<p>我依稀記者一個較凉快的長夜，幾個朋友往校園裏的草地上閒談，燈光從瑣碎的樹隙間照下來，還能看見幾隻閃耀的面孔，一切未來的希望，都在刹那間很滿足的微笑了，那正是行畢業禮的晚上，六年窗下，換得一紙文憑，但是同學們一旦分離，依依不捨的眞情，促成我們作最後一次的聚餐會，聚餐席上談笑生風，那一種逸興遄飛的情景，誰知會換來今天回憶的惆悵！</p>
<p>初夏，淸晨天氣凉爽，一輛汽車，在拂拂微風中向火車站進發，駿和微是我最知已的朋友，我辭不掉他們的熱情，其實也捨不得最後一刻的相聚，送我到車站，車站上似乎換了一種空氣，使我們窒息着不能講一句話，黯然消沉的離别情緒整個的佔領着各人的心扉，終於在「常常通信」的慘别中火車向我故鄕進發，我佔據着車廂的一角，幻想他們歸校時的頽毀，不禁濳然淚下。</p>
<p>故鄕漸漸的接近，六年前雪夜分别的車站，在陽光裏露出粉飾過的笑臉歡迎我，久不聽見的鄕音漸漸地雜閙着；在人羣中一個蘋果般的小臉舉着手高呼我，那是六年不見的弟弟萍影，已長成得那末高了。</p>
<p>夢裏的故鄕實現在我面前了，她並不像我夢裏的美妙，一禮拜後我確實感騐到了，這是我初嘗人生的苦味，也是踏出校門後預想不到的事。</p>
<p>家庭間的衝突，没有身受的人不能從旁人的臉上搜尋出來，而自身受到了牠的苦難的又不屑詳細地告訴旁人，因爲縱然能到得旁人的同情，但同情無補於我，我現在就用「家庭衝突」的四字被故鄕擠逼出來，但並不包括「婚姻」或者更瑣小的事在内。</p>
<p>我重來送我回故鄕的火車上漂泊之途了，没有一個人送行，没有一個人可憐，人類的没有眞實的同情心，都在這裏暴露，而一杯滿滿的苦酒，放在每一個被遺棄了的人的面前了。</p>
<p>三天後訪着駿和微的行踪，他們合資辦一所書局，我擔任了校對之責和塗些東西，生活也很安然的過去，三人同居在編輯所的樓上，三個人爲生活而生活着，辦事很認眞，雖然常常有過半夜然後可以安睡的，但是身心兩方面都很安適，一月過後，已是人間天上的團圓節了，</p>
<p>編輯所的凉臺上，不成所謂宴會的喝着酒，月光當然很聖潔的普照人間，不過人間的悲歡離合非聖潔的月光所能了解罷了。</p>
<p>「你們爲甚不回家去呢？」我喝了一杯酒，若有所感的問。</p>
<p>「你呢？」</p>
<p>「有家歸不得啊！」我禁不住笑了。</p>
<p>「有家歸不得；」駿反覆的吟誦著，同時擎起一杯酒，一飮而盡。</p>
<p>「朋友！」駿的聲音激慷起來，「有家歸不得的朋友携手起來，同盡此一杯！」</p>
<p>月光從烏雲裏探出頭來看我們同飮一杯，酒席上的空氣重行濃厚，談到卓氏的馬戲，易卜生的傀儡家庭，朋友間的戀愛故事，再有學校時的頑皮生活…</p>
<p>席散時駿鄭重的說「以後不許誰流一滴眼淚，堕我們的勇氣。」</p>
<p>我們在不許流淚的環境下，延長了半年生活：</p>
<p>書局裏爲了某種嫌疑，書店被對了，駿和微奔亡了，我只負了校對責任，未罹於難。</p>
<p>以後的生活，無統系的漂流了，其間也曾歸家種竹養龜，閉門悔故，但終於「家」不能屬於我的。</p>
<p>唉！漂流！漂流！七，十七兩夜。</p>

<h3>A Respectful Announcement to this Year's University Graduates</h3>
<p>In the rapid flow of time, as swift as a white horse flashing past, we have now arrived at summer vacation, the end of the academic year.</p>
<p>Within these few weeks, universities and colleges across the country will once again see a large number of students graduating. Except for a small portion who will continue their studies, the majority will inevitably end their golden era of student life and begin to step into society.</p>
<p>However, before you all set foot into society, have you ever given yourselves a thorough plan? In other words, what are you preparing to do?</p>
<p>What I am naturally referring to here is not asking how you will seek employment, how you will make a living, or how you will embark on the path of new politicians and bureaucrats, because these are "personal problems" that I do not intend to discuss now. What I am asking is how to understand this turbulent era, this dilapidated society, this disaster-ridden nation on the verge of life and death. At the same time, how to further understand the mission that you should bear and what kind of person you intend to become.</p>
<p>Indeed, "personal problems" cannot be considered unimportant and urgently need to be solved. Perhaps you see issues such as "career," "life," and "personal prospects" as more pressing and more important. But in fact, "personal problems" can only find their basis when placed within the entire social problem. At the same time, only when the entire social problem is resolved can personal problems also be resolved. In the current dilapidated, collapsing, turbulent, and dark society, unemployment, hunger, cold, punishment, and death constantly surround everyone—except for the special class. Amidst the sighs of mass unemployment and the cries of mass hunger and cold, can your careers and your livelihoods be solved individually? Even if it is temporarily possible, it will ultimately only be "temporary." Therefore, I say that "personal problems" can only be solved after the entire social problem is resolved. Here, you should be able to see your own position clearly and recognize the mission that individuals should bear in the suffering masses.</p>
<p>According to the statistics released by the Ministry of Education last year, there are only 34 universities and 16 vocational schools in the country. There are only 12,225 university students and 2,168 vocational students. In proportion to our country's total population of 450 million, there is only one university for every 9 million people and only one university student for every 31,135 people. You have been very fortunate to be able to compete for a university education opportunity among more than 30,000 people. But the fact that a majority of over 30,000 people extract their blood and sweat to provide you with a university education is not so much a matter of your luck, but rather precisely reveals the increased weight of your mission. You are the privileged members of society, and many problems are now on display, eagerly awaiting you to take action.</p>
<p>"Recognize the times" and "recognize yourself" are two phrases you should always keep in mind. The times are clearly changing. The unprecedented economic panic has made the world feel unprecedented distress. Within our country, due to the oppression of foreign enemies since the September 18th Incident and the increasing chaos of domestic politics, the social economy is increasingly dilapidated, and people's livelihoods are also increasingly difficult. Society is also shifting its direction. This is an extraordinary era and also a great era. In this extraordinary and great era, how will you handle yourselves? In other words, what kind of "force" are you planning to make yourselves into? Is it a "force" that promotes the times, or a "force" that hinders the progress of the times?</p>
<p>"Faith" is true awareness and also the source of vitality. After recognizing the times and recognizing society, you must especially determine your own faith and strive according to your own faith. Otherwise, you will be like a blind person riding a blind horse, scurrying around in the dark. Either you trample on others, or others trample on you.</p>
<p>I believe that we have now reached an unprecedented turbulent stage. China, in particular, has reached an unprecedented stage of corruption. You must understand the way out for the survival of the masses from an economic point of view, and at the same time, bravely grasp your own way out. Sorrow and anger, sentimentality and decadence are all useless. The result is equivalent to suicide.</p>
<p>As you begin to step into society, I respectfully offer you this piece of advice and sincerely wish you the beginning of a new life of struggle.</p>

<h3>The International Disarmament Conference, Fraught With Deceit, Prepares to Adjourn</h3>
<p>Czech Foreign Minister to Draft Report</p>
<p>No Agreement Yet Reached Among Nations on US Disarmament Proposal</p>
<p>Germany's Demand for Equality in Armaments Put Aside for Discussion</p>
<p>Geneva, 17th, Guomin News Agency: The report drafted by Czech Foreign Minister Beneš clearly signals that the Disarmament Conference will decide to adjourn. The content begins with a preface, based on the resolutions already passed during January and April regarding the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the US President's proposal. The issue of Germany's demand for equality in armaments will be left for future discussion. Next, based on what was discussed and resolved at the conference, all acts of aerial bombardment of civilians are prohibited, but the possibility of national governments agreeing to permit aerial bombardment in certain areas is still reserved. Regarding land armaments, only a limit on the tonnage of tanks and an agreement on the maximum caliber of artillery, to be handled in the same way as naval artillery, are suggested. In addition, the drafting of international law specifically targeting chemical warfare and the issue of organizing a permanent committee to manage armaments are also discussed. The third part of the report discusses preparations for the second phase of the Disarmament Conference, the most important of which is that the Executive Committee should consider President Hoover's proposal and the various proposals already obtained by the representatives at the conference, and recommends authorizing the major naval powers to negotiate and continue reducing naval armaments themselves.</p>
<h3>German Party Strife Intensifies</h3>
<p>Extremes of Left and Right Are Incompatible</p>
<p>Mass Gatherings and Fierce Fighting Result in Many Casualties</p>
<p>Troops Deployed to Suppress Unrest Before Calm Returns</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th, Reuters: Communist and National Socialist parties clashed again in various parts of Germany, resulting in 11 deaths and 83 injuries. The situation in Altona was particularly serious. Yesterday, when the National Socialists were parading there, the Communists attacked with guns from rooftops. The 10,000 paraders then attacked the Communist headquarters en masse, resulting in 10 deaths and over 50 injuries on both sides.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th, Guomin News Agency: Whenever there is political turmoil, Sundays often see conflicts between political enemies. Today was no exception. There are reports of conflicts in many parts of Germany, the most violent being in Altona, near Hamburg, where nearly a thousand National Socialists and Communists engaged in a desperate battle. The police tried to dissuade them, but to no avail. The battle gradually spread into Hamburg, almost developing into a massive conflict. It took a long time to calm down. According to the official announcement, 12 people died and 50 were injured, including six women who are in critical condition. Two police officers were also seriously injured. Over 200 people were arrested. Also, in Fürstenwalde, near Berlin, a parade by the National Socialist Stormtroopers triggered a conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Before long, republican elements also joined the Communists, escalating the situation. There were few police officers in the town, and the authorities urgently dispatched the army to assist in the suppression. Fortunately, the army arrived, and both sides immediately dispersed. There were only minor conflicts in other places. However, since the National Socialist Party declared that it would arm its Stormtroopers and, if the government did not suppress the Republicans and Communists within 48 hours, it would take action itself, the situation has become even more tense.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th, Havas: Although conflicts between various political enemies in Germany have been frequent recently, they have always been suppressed by the police and the army has never been used. This only started last night. Last night, a truck loaded with National Socialists was heading to a campaign rally in Forst Zinna, near Beelitz, when it was attacked by Communists. The conflict escalated, and the few gendarmes and police officers present were not enough to quell the unrest. Therefore, the local authorities requested assistance from the county magistrate of Potsdam. However, the county had already sent all its police officers to maintain order at numerous political gatherings, so the county magistrate had no choice but to ask the army authorities to dispatch a squadron of cavalry to surround a hotel where about 140 Communists were hiding. The police and gendarmes then rushed into the building and searched the demonstrators one by one. Although nothing was found on their persons, many handguns and knives were found inside the hotel. Most of the Communists were from Berlin, so the police took the arrestees back to Berlin. The soldiers who were dispatched returned to their barracks after the search. The police report stated that the demonstrators became docile as soon as they saw the soldiers arrive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th, Guomin News Agency: Following the major conflict between the National Socialists and Communists in Altona and Hamburg yesterday, which resulted in 12 deaths and 107 serious injuries, including 54 in critical condition, the Federal Government and the Prussian State Government will meet today to discuss preventing similar conflicts from happening again in the future. The Altona police station has officially announced that the Communists are fully responsible for yesterday's conflict, because they suddenly opened fire on the National Socialist parade with supervising officers from rooftops and windows. At that time, the police were forced to return fire, firing about 150 shots. The parade then dispersed, and order was completely restored by midnight.</p>

<p>Washington, 17th, Guomin News Agency: American officials and businessmen are currently filled with apprehension as they await the opening of the British Imperial Conference in Ottawa, fearing that the annual US exports of goods worth 1 billion dollars to the British Empire will be hit, and that American economic life will be significantly affected. The economic relationship between Britain and the United States is almost unparalleled. US exports to the British Empire account for 43% of its total exports, and Canada is the US's largest customer. If the proposal for preferential tariffs within the Empire is implemented, trade between Britain and the United States will be greatly affected. British factories that purchase American raw materials will switch to purchasing domestic raw materials, and British agricultural territories that sell American goods will switch to selling domestic manufactured goods. Not only will trade suffer huge losses, but the establishment of preferential tariff systems within the Empire may also prompt American industrialists to establish branches in Canada and other British territories to avoid heavy taxes. In recent years, the practice of American industrialists establishing branches abroad has been increasing rapidly. American politicians, especially labor leaders, are increasingly concerned about foreign workers receiving wages and the growing unemployment in the United States. According to government experts, there are currently over 2,000 American-owned branch factories in Canada and 300-400 in Britain. This not only affects the labor sector but also has a considerable impact on foreign trade. Therefore, American officials and businessmen have been deeply apprehensive about the Ottawa Conference.</p>
<h3>Irish People Protest British Special Tax</h3>
<p>Shops Display Banners Rejecting British Goods</p>
<p>De Valera States</p>
<p>Will Not Accept Imperial Arbitration</p>
<p>Will Continue to Suspend Land Annuity Payments</p>
<p>Dublin, 18th, Reuters: Shop windows in the capital of the Free State are plastered with leaflets, and banners are hung in the streets, proclaiming the rejection of British goods. Police have been ordered by the government to tear down these banners. Meetings are being held throughout the city to discuss practical methods to protest the British government's imposition of special taxes on goods from the Free State. Several days ago, a number of horses from the Free State were transported to the border to participate in races near Belfast. British officials demanded a horse tax of 20 pounds per horse. The horse owners refused to pay the tax, and the horses were returned.</p>
<p>Dublin, 18th, Reuters: After a lengthy meeting of the Free State cabinet today, Executive Council President de Valera issued a statement reaffirming the Free State government's unwillingness to accept Imperial arbitration, and said that the Free State would not continue to pay land annuities while negotiations were in progress. The government does not want to engage in economic warfare with Britain but is determined to protect the rights of the people of the Free State who are being forced to bear the burden of the current payments.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Irish Dispute Could Affect US Attitude Towards War Debts</h3>
<p>Paris, 18th, Guomin News Agency: Diplomatic circles here are deeply concerned about the news of the escalating Anglo-Irish dispute, fearing that it will affect the World Economic Conference this autumn. The Economic Conference must have the US abandon its current tough stance on European debts to achieve positive results. If the Anglo-Irish dispute is not resolved soon, the US, with 12 million Irish-American voters, can easily influence the presidential election and may use its electoral power to block US concessions to Britain and other European debtor nations.</p>
<h3>White House Gates Locked Tight</h3>
<p>To Prevent Veteran Demonstrations</p>
<p>Washington, 17th, Havas: Police have closed the iron gates of the White House and blocked all nearby traffic with ropes to prevent veterans of the European War, who are demanding the issuance of bonus payments, from causing further disturbances at the White House. The veterans are protesting because Congress, before deciding to adjourn until December, did not pass a bill that would allow them to receive a total of 2 billion US dollars in bonus payments. A bill on the issuance of bonus payments to veterans has been passed by the House of Representatives but rejected by the Senate. Recently, 7,000 veterans have been camping around the Capitol, nearly causing serious disturbances.</p>
<p>Washington, 17th, Guomin News Agency: The leader of the veteran petition representatives expressed deep disappointment with Congress's adjournment without discussing the bonus payment bill. Under the current circumstances, it seems that a movement to remain in the capital is being brewed. As long as food is sufficient to sustain them, they will temporarily reject government assistance and stay in the capital, waiting for Congress to convene a short session in December to petition again. However, reporters have observed that all veteran shelters are strictly observing military discipline and maintaining order, and there are no signs of unwillingness to accept assistance. Local authorities are doing their best to assist those who wish to return home.</p>
<h3>Japanese Local Officials Conference</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th, Japan United Press: The conference of local officials to deliberate on the current cabinet's policy for alleviating the current situation opened at the Prime Minister's official residence at 9:00 this morning. Police Commissioner-General Fujinuma, Hokkaido Governor Sanjo, the governors of Osaka and Tokyo Prefectures, and the governors of the two prefectures and 43 counties all attended. First, Prime Minister Saito, Foreign Minister Uchida, and Finance Minister Takahashi delivered speeches, followed by reports from the governors on local conditions. A luncheon was held at noon, with Prime Minister Saito delivering a speech and the Governor of Osaka Prefecture responding. The meeting resumed at 1:30 PM, deliberating on rural issues in various counties.</p>
<h3>Uchida Speaks on the Manchurian Problem</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th, Japan United Press: The gist of Foreign Minister Uchida's speech at today's conference of local officials is as follows: The establishment of Manchukuo is the result of the political disintegration of China. Now that a new nation has been established, Japan must hope for the development of Manchukuo. The current government has decided on a policy of recognizing Manchukuo at a certain time, but first, various preparations must be made.</p>
<h3>Japanese Finance Minister Consults on Fiscal Crisis</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th, China United Press: Finance Minister Takahashi stated at today's conference of local officials that Japan's finances are facing a crisis. The newly issued government bonds this year exceed 615 million yen, of which 160 million yen is to make up for the budget deficit. This is unprecedented in Japanese finance. The new budget of the extraordinary Diet also uses government bonds as a source of funds for various emergency relief projects. To escape this crisis, the people must have a major determination, otherwise, it will be difficult to overcome this difficult situation. Among the various requests for government relief, some requests are made in the name of national treasury subsidies, but in reality, they are requests to save a certain group or its private interests. The government absolutely cannot agree to this kind of proposal. (This statement implicitly refers to the unreasonable obstruction of the Seiyukai). The people must recognize the current national situation and cooperate with the government to find ways to escape this predicament.</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>Seiyu and Minsei Parties Communicate</p>
<p>Promoting the Ugalaki Enlistment Movement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th, Telegraph: As political unrest gradually expands, Governor-General Ugaki of Korea suddenly entered Beijing. Some in the political world are secretly plotting to support Ugaki's rise to power. As for the political tide, within the Minseito Party, there is a movement to reinstate Adachi. The majority of the party is seeking a suitable central figure. In particular, since the establishment of the National Policy Research Club, there have been many defections. Although there are those who are trying to reverse this trend, the future of these movements is in danger of expanding, which is extremely worrying. Also, figures such as Koizumi Fusanosuke of the Seiyukai have begun various considerations. There are also elements of the Minsei and Seiyu parties who are communicating with each other, plotting to unite with the Adachi faction and form a new party centered on Ugaki. However, Ugaki's aides are advising him not to enter the fray at a time when the established parties have lost credibility, and that it is wiser to remain calm and observe future developments. Ugaki himself has considerable intentions to be active in the political world. Ugaki's attitude will have a major impact on the future of the political world, and the machinations of the various factions surrounding Ugaki are particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th, Japan United Press: Colonial Minister Nagai met with Korean Governor Ugaki last night to discuss Korean governance issues, Manchurian-Mongolian issues, and recent current issues.</p>
<h3>Japan Purchases Large Quantities of Military Supplies From Germany</h3>
<p>Preparing for a Far East War</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th, China United Press: According to a certain military expert in Tokyo, Japan has realized that a Far East war is inevitable and has ordered its military attaché in Germany to order large quantities of gunpowder, bullets, cannons, and poison gas bombs from Germany. The exact number is unknown, but it is said to be very large. As a result, German arms factories have suddenly become busy, and unemployed workers have also gained new jobs. Japan has also made a secret agreement with the German Pan-German League, with the condition of attacking Soviet Russia. Japan and Germany seem to have reached some kind of meaningful understanding.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Ranks Second in the World in Steel Production and Oil Production</h3>
<p>Two Giant Metallurgical Furnaces Put Into Operation One After Another</p>
<p>Daily Production of 1,800 Tons of Cast Iron</p>
<p>Moscow, 17th, Havas: A giant metallurgical furnace with a volume of 826 cubic meters has recently been installed and put into operation at the Kuznetsk Metallurgical Plant. This is the second furnace. The first furnace was put into operation several months ago. When both furnaces are working at full capacity, they can produce 1,800 tons of cast iron per day. Reports of this event coincide with a comparison of Soviet steel, coal, pig iron, and oil production figures for the first half of 1932 with those for the first half of 1929.</p>
<p>First Half of 1932 First Half of 1929</p>
<p>Pig Iron Production 3,000,000 tons 2,100,000 tons</p>
<p>Steel Production 2,900,000 tons 2,400,000 tons</p>
<p>Coal Production 33,000,000 tons 19,300,000 tons</p>
<p>Oil Production 11,200,000 tons 6,400,000 tons</p>
<p>In terms of metallurgical efficiency, the Soviet Union ranks first in Europe. Globally, the United States ranks first, and the Soviet Union ranks second. In terms of coal production, the Soviet Union ranks third in Europe and fourth globally, ahead of France. As for oil extraction, the Soviet Union ranks clearly second globally, surpassed only by the United States.</p>
<h3>Chinese Officials Inspect German Steel Industry</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th, Guomin News Agency: Liu Wentao, the Chinese ambassador to Germany, accompanied a group of Chinese experts and engineers on a tour of the Ruhr region to inspect the German mining and steel industry. They will visit numerous mines and several factories of the German Steel Trust, as well as factories of the Thyssen Group.</p>
<h3>Showa Steel Works in Japan Closed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th, Havas Communication: A general meeting of shareholders of Showa Steel Works has resolved to close all factories belonging to the company and reopen them when the situation improves. As a result, all machinery belonging to the company, worth 8 million yen, has become useless. In reality, however, this machinery has not been used for two years. Showa Steel Works was established in 1929 by the South Manchuria Railway Company (Mantetsu) with a nominal capital of 100 million yen, of which one-quarter was paid up. At that time, machinery was purchased (mostly purchased from Germany), but the machinery has not yet been put into use. The reason why this steel business has not been able to proceed earlier is that, first, there was a dispute over the factory site, which took a lot of time. Later, the South Manchuria Railway Company was unable to raise the necessary funds, so it was delayed until now. Recently, steel prices have fallen, there is a surplus of steel in Japan, and the Japanese government is afraid to adopt a steel policy immediately. For all these reasons, the factory had no choice but to close.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>A GlimPSE OF JAPANESE SOCIETY</h3>
<p>Tax Arrears: The Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun reports that due to the severe economic recession, citizens in both urban and rural areas are increasingly impoverished, with tax arrears reaching 15 million yen. Approximately 300,000 people are in arrears, with land tax arrears accounting for 200,000, demonstrating the extreme hardship in rural economies. Similarly, small and medium-sized businesses are declining, and business taxes cannot be paid, causing difficulties for financial authorities.</p>
<p>Increase in Runaways: Recently, due to livelihood difficulties, the number of runaways has surged. According to investigations by the Metropolitan Police Department's Criminal Investigation Division, from January to June of this year, 7,500 men and 4,900 women, totaling 12,000 people, have been taken in by charity and shelter institutions due to running away. These are mostly due to difficult living conditions, mental deficiencies, poor character, or romantic relationships.</p>
<p>Increase in Prostitution: According to a recent survey by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the number of young girls falling into prostitution has doubled nationwide. As of Showa 5 (1930), there were 10,861 brothels nationwide, with 52,117 prostitutes, an increase of 2,640 compared to last year. This negative phenomenon is contrary to the anti-prostitution movement.</p>
<p>Student Theft: Recently, the trend of elementary school students forming theft gangs has become rampant. Although repeatedly exposed, it has not been eradicated. Recently, in Miyaji Town, Aso District, Kumamoto Prefecture, Miyaji Elementary School even saw the emergence of a theft gang formed by more than 50 students, who divided into groups each night to steal from shops large and small. The Miyaji Police Station investigated and discovered stolen goods worth over 1,000 yuan in the Tenpo Shrine mountain.</p>
<p>Unemployment of Maids: Recently, the social economy has become increasingly impoverished, and middle-class families mostly do not hire maids. Even shops and organizations have reduced their staff. Therefore, the number of unemployed female students seeking work is increasing monthly. The Kanda Employment Agency and Iidabashi Women's Employment Agency receive about a thousand job seekers each month, but due to limited demand, they are unable to find placements.</p>
<h3>NORTHEAST REBELS PREPARING TO SEIZE POSTAL RIGHTS</h3>
<p>New Stamps to Be Issued on August 1st</p>
<p>Japanese National, Fujiwara, Sent to Shenyang to Proceed</p>
<p>Shenyang dispatch: The Northeastern rebel organization, in order to implement the takeover of Northeastern postal rights, recently sent Fujiwara, the so-called Director of Manchurian Postal Affairs, to Shenyang to actively negotiate with the Liaoning Postal Director regarding the issuance of new stamps on August 1st. Although rejected, they are still proceeding recklessly and have announced the types and dates of the new stamps' issuance through a Japanese-style Chinese circular from the pseudo-Ministry of Communications. Judging from the types and names of the stamps printed, it is known that they intend to use them within the pseudo-Manchukuo and Japan. However, the postal relationship between China and Japan in the three Northeastern provinces is based on the 1910 Sino-Japanese Postal Agreement. If Japan establishes a postal relationship with the pseudo-Manchukuo it created, it would violate this agreement. It is earnestly hoped that the people of the country will pay close attention to this. The original text of their announcement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Stamps: Regarding the issuance of new postal postcards and stamps, Manchurian postal postcards and stamps will be changed to the following five types of postcards and eighteen types of stamps starting from the first year of Datong (1932), August 1st. Old postal postcards and stamps can still be used as before for one month starting from the first year of Datong, August 1st. Those who have old postcards and stamps can bring them to the post office to exchange for new postcards and new stamps. The exchange period is limited to December 31st of the first year of Datong. (1) Types of new postal postcards: one fen brown, two fen green, two fen round-trip postcard brown, four fen round-trip postcard green, one fen five li red. (2) Types of new stamps: half fen banana tea color, one fen clover color, one fen five li light purple, two fen blue, three fen kite color, four fen oriole tea color, five fen green, six fen red, seven fen mouse color, eight fen golden tea color, one jiao vermilion, one jiao three fen gray, one jiao five fen tea color, one jiao six fen dark green, two jiao burnt tea color, three jiao yellow ochre, five jiao old green, one yuan reddish purple.</p>

Old postal money orders are valid only until August 1st of the first year of Datong. Types of postal money orders: one fen green tea color, two fen green, five fen reddish-purple, one jiao blue, two jiao gray, five jiao golden tea color, one yuan crimson tea color, two yuan green, five yuan reddish-purple, ten yuan blue, twenty yuan gray, fifty yuan golden tea color,</p>
<p>one hundred yuan red.</p>

<h3>ZHANG QUN ARRIVES IN BEIPING ON JIANG'S ORDERS</h3>
<p>To Confer with Zhang Xueliang on Important Matters</p>
<p>Beiping dispatch: Zhang Qun recently came north to Beiping on orders from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He left Hankou on the 11th, first going to Kaifeng to represent Chiang in offering condolences for the passing of Liu Zhi's mother. On the 13th, he passed through Zhengzhou from Bian, taking the Pinghan express train north. He arrived in Beiping at 7:40 AM on the 14th. Wan Fulin, Wang Shuhan, Tang Guozhen, and Jiang Bocheng, among others, all went to the West Station to greet him. After Zhang alighted from the train, he took a car to his residence at the Beijing Hotel to rest. Wang and Jiang accompanied him to the hotel and met with him for a long time. Wan Fulin hosted a banquet at his residence at 7:00 PM that evening to welcome Zhang, and invited important military and political figures from Beiping to attend. Zhang also scheduled to visit Director of Pacification Zhang Xueliang that evening to confer on important matters. According to Zhang, "This time I have come to Beiping to visit Director Zhang and have no special mission. The length of my stay in Beiping has not been determined. Since I haven't been to the north in over a year, I plan to stay for a few more days. My departure from Beiping may not be via the Pinghan Railway southward; I may first go to Tianjin and then take the Jinpu Railway to Nanjing and then to Hankou. Regarding the suppression of bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, before Commander-in-Chief Chiang went to Hankou, the provinces had joint defense, but there was a lack of command convenience, so there were no satisfactory results. Commander-in-Chief Chiang came to Hankou to take overall control for thorough elimination. There should be concrete measures for the suppression plan. The Sichuan troops under Fan Shaozeng in western Hubei previously came into contact with bandits in the Songzi area and suffered slight damage. Currently, they have achieved victory. The communist bandits in Macheng, eastern Hubei, are currently confronting government troops outside the city and have not attacked the city. Now that the bandits have heard of the advance of a large army, they plan to flee into mountain lairs and are being pursued by government troops; defeat is imminent and not a problem. The situation of bandit suppression in Anhui Province is also progressing. The communist bandits in the southern section of the Henan Pinghan Railway have been defeated. The defenses in southern Henan, where Ma Hongkui, Liu Zhi, and Zhang Fang are stationed, are solid, and the communist bandits are no longer able to rise up again. When I passed through Wusheng Pass, I met Ma Hongkui. He said that the bandit problem in southern Henan would soon be completely eliminated, etc. Also, the headquarters of the communist bandits in the three provinces is in the mountains of Shangcheng County, Henan. The strategy adopted by the communist bandits is to avoid strength and attack weakness, dividing into smaller units. The headquarters has strict measures to deal with this and anticipates that the communist bandits in the three provinces can be eliminated within two or three months. Commander-in-Chief Chiang will not leave Hankou for the time being; whether he will go to Hunan has not been determined. The rumor that the troops stationed in North China will be transferred south to assist in bandit suppression is not accurate. The small portion previously transferred was to suppress the bandit troops of Liu Guitang and is unrelated to this matter. This time, the bandit suppression in the three provinces does not focus solely on suppression. Among the communist bandits, there are many who joined due to intimidation and coercion, so it was decided to implement both pacification and suppression. The Party and Government Committee in the bandit areas was established based on this practical need and also to handle post-bandit affairs. Initially, it was intended to establish a Political Bureau, but it was later decided to expand its scope and change it to a Party and Government Committee because (1) the Bureau could only be managed by the Director and not a committee system, and (2) Party affairs should not be included. This committee is directly under the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the three provinces and has supervisory and guiding functions but is not external. The members of the committee do not hold local government positions so that they can focus on the pacification of bandit areas and post-disaster work. Each of the three provinces has a Party and Government Conference; the members of the local government and Party headquarters are all ex officio members and belong to the Party and Government Committee, whose nature is the same as the Party and Government Committee. All matters concerning post-bandit affairs reported to the headquarters are directly presented to the Party and Government Committee for forwarding and processing. The regulations of the Party and Government Committee were agreed upon before I left Hankou and have now been announced and established. The detailed organization need not be repeated. The duties of the Political Affairs Guidance Office that I am in charge of will be handled by the Deputy Director during my absence." Finally, when discussing diplomatic issues, the reporter first asked if China had any intention of turning the Northeast into an autonomous region, as reported by the Japanese side to the League of Nations investigation team. According to the response, "I have not heard of this matter and believe that it is absolutely impossible. Regarding the current diplomatic situation, the following conclusion can be drawn: Today's diplomacy allows neither optimism nor pessimism. The whole country should unite and work together with a spirit of great fearlessness and effective methods to carry out everything. There is hope for the future," etc. (15th)</p>
<h3>SONG QINGLING ET AL. GUARANTEE BAW DINH'S RELEASE AGAIN</h3>
<p>Baw Dinh and his wife sent to the mausoleum for treatment</p>
<p>Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, and others previously sent a letter guaranteeing the release of Baw Dinh and his wife to Shanghai for medical treatment, and then sent another letter requesting the withdrawal of the guarantee. On the 16th, Yang Xingfo came to Nanjing again to request the guarantee again. Song Qingling also arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 17th to proceed together. After several rounds of negotiation, Baw Dinh and his wife were finally transferred to the vicinity of Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum for treatment at 7:30 PM on the 17th with the approval of the court. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Song Qingling comes to Nanjing to request guarantee: Song Qingling, Yang Xingfo, etc., upon learning that the resignations of Law Chief Luo Wengan and Vice Minister Zheng Tianxi were not due to their request to guarantee the release of Baw Dinh and his wife, decided to request the guarantee again. After Yang Xingfo arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 16th, he visited Luo Wengan twice. Luo said that the request for temporary guarantee was in accordance with the law, but the court should not interfere with the judiciary through administration, and since he had already resigned, he had no right to intervene. Therefore, he asked Yang and others to contact the Jiangsu High Court, which was hearing the case. On the night of the 16th, Ms. Song Qingling also came to Nanjing from Shanghai by train, arriving at about 7:00 AM on the morning of the 17th. After getting off the train, she immediately went with Yang Xingfo to the Jiangning District Court Detention Center to visit Baw Dinh and his wife, informing them of the intention to request the guarantee again and offering words of comfort. Song, Yang, and others then left the court to visit Luo Wengan, but Luo was dealing with important official business before leaving for elsewhere and did not meet them. At 11:00 AM, Song, Yang, and Feng Jiesi, a relative of Baw Dinh and his wife, went to the Jiangning District Court together. Li, the Director of the Ministry of Justice and Administration, also arrived at the time, and they immediately discussed the guarantee procedures in the reception room together.</p>
<p>The Court Approves Temporary Release on Bail: When Song, Yang, Li, Feng, and others were discussing in the reception room, they all used English and prohibited others from entering the room. The discussion lasted for an hour and a half, with Yang Xingfo speaking the most, exhausting his request for release responsibility. It was heard that initially, Song, Yang, and others still intended to ask the court to allow them to be transferred to Shanghai for medical treatment, but the court held that the case still needed to be tried continuously before the jurisdiction issue was resolved. If they could not be summoned as needed when the court was in session, it would cause great difficulties for the trial. Moreover, it was unknown whether there would be accidents along the way when Baw Dinh and his wife were transferred to Shanghai, and the guarantor had to bear full responsibility, so it was not approved. Song, Yang, and others also felt that the responsibility was too great, so the result of the discussion was to decide to seek medical treatment in Nanjing. At 12:30 PM, Song, Yang, and others went to Baw Dinh and his wife to inform them of this intention, but Baw Dinh and his wife expressed disagreement. Song, Yang, Li, and others then returned to the reception room to negotiate. It was said that the weather had been hot recently, and it was feared that the hospitals would not be adequate, so it was decided to choose a suitable house near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and extend medical treatment every day. When Song, Yang, and Li were negotiating, Li Mian, the Criminal Division Chief of the Jiangsu High Court, had already returned to Nanjing from Suzhou on the night of the 16th, but he avoided seeing guests during the trial period and did not participate in the discussion. However, he expressed agreement with the results of the discussion between Song, Yang, and others, so he approved it.</p>
<p>Baw Dinh and his wife leave the court: After the Jiangsu High Court approved the temporary release on bail, the Jiangning District Court Detention Center immediately prepared all the procedures. At 7:30 PM, the Jiangsu High Court immediately signed the release of Baw Dinh and his wife from the detention center. Baw Dinh and his wife had been on hunger strike for sixteen days and could not walk, so the detention center sent people to carry them out to the car outside the door and drive them to a house near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum for recuperation. The Jiangsu High Court also sent police to guard them. It was heard that Baw Dinh and his wife had expressed their intention to resume eating immediately after leaving the court and would be properly cared for by doctors, starting with nutritious liquids. It was heard that Song Qingling, Yang Xingfo, and others left Nanjing for Shanghai on the night of the 17th after the procedures were completed.</p>
<p>Comments from legal experts expressing indignation: On the 17th, the reporter met a legal expert in Nanjing and asked for his opinion on the Baw Dinh and his wife hunger strike case. He gave a fair and detailed opinion as follows: "The case of Baw Dinh and his wife endangering the Republic of China is very serious, but the handling procedures are very simple. The court only needs to conduct a trial in accordance with the law, investigate the evidence, and judge whether they have committed a crime or the severity of the crime according to the law. However, Baw Dinh and his wife have consistently refused to be tried, seeking favors and making unreasonable demands, directly despising our country's laws and being enemies of the law. They started a hunger strike because their request to apply for jurisdiction and hire foreign lawyers to defend them was not allowed. While expressing their firm hunger strike, they also accepted the diagnosis and treatment of doctors, making it clear that they had no determination to die and were intimidating and coercing. The court has done its duty by trying its best to guide them and extending medical treatment every day since they went on hunger strike. If Baw Dinh and his wife unfortunately starve to death in prison, it will be their own fault, and the court will not bear the slightest responsibility. Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, and others requested the court to temporarily release them on bail, and they insisted that they must be sent to a hospital in Shanghai and refused to receive treatment in a hospital in Nanjing, which is even more unreasonable. The diseases caused by their hunger strike are their own fault. And the hospitals in Nanjing, such as the Central Hospital and Gulou Hospital, are well-equipped and can treat the diseases caused by the hunger strike. Why must they go to a hospital in Shanghai to be treated? It is speculated that their intention is nothing more than to use this to forcefully pressure the court and achieve their goal of transferring jurisdiction and hiring foreign lawyers. The judicial authorities resigned in anger because of this, and this spirit is deeply admired by us. What the judicial authorities are fighting for is to maintain the law. It is a shining example for our country's political circles to abandon their position and fight for the sake of maintaining the law. At a time when our country's judicial politics is in its infancy, it is necessary to maintain its spirit of independence, and extraterritorial rights must be actively recovered. In the future, foreigners who commit crimes must be tried under our country's laws. If we relax the law against a stateless criminal who endangers the Republic of China at this time, then everyone will follow suit in the future, and what law will our country have? The destruction of the judiciary will be unimaginable. Now is a time of national crisis, with internal and external troubles pressing in on us. The way to save our country from danger depends on the efforts and struggles of our people. Whether Baw Dinh and his wife have committed a crime or the severity of the crime can be judged by the court in accordance with the law. There is no need to stir up such a big wave in the Judicial Yuan. If Baw Dinh and his wife are scholars and should be given special consideration, then there are countless scholars and young people in our country who have been convicted of endangering the Republic of China. Lightly treating Chinese and valuing foreigners, what is the reason for this? Moreover, Baw Dinh and his wife still need to be tried in accordance with the law," etc. He was extremely indignant during his speech. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>FUZHOU MERCHANTS AND RESIDENTS STRIKE</h3>
<p>Opposing the Provincial Government's Collection of House and Shop Donations</p>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch: Merchants and residents in Fujian oppose the provincial government's heavy collection of house and shop donations. On the morning of the 14th, the Commercial Affairs Research Institute and Fire Brigade of each shop held a joint meeting and decided to thoroughly oppose it. They also requested the Nineteenth Route Army Commander Cai Tingkai to come to the province as their backing. They notified all shops in the city to post slogans at their doors, uniformly saying "Welcome Nineteenth Route Army Commander Cai Tingkai, we vow to deny the heavy collection of house and shop donations" to show their determination. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a large number of officers and inspectors that evening to supervise the police to clear the streets, using black paint to paint over the seven characters "deny the heavy collection of house and shop donations," leaving only the eleven characters "Welcome Nineteenth Route Army Commander Cai Tingkai we vow," completely changing the meaning. When the merchants and residents opened their shops on the morning of the 15th and saw that the slogans had been painted over, they were deeply suspicious. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM, the House and Shop Donation Office suddenly sent a large number of security police teams and soldiers from the Second Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, fully armed, to forcibly collect donations in cooperation with the collectors, first in the busiest Nan Street and Zhongting Street shops in the city. Those who resisted were immediately arrested, causing great anger among the shops, which immediately announced a strike. Upon hearing the news, the Commercial Affairs Research Institute of each shop held an emergency meeting at the Shanghang Street County Chamber of Commerce at 10:00 AM, resolving that all shops in the city would strike in resistance. After the meeting, the representatives set off in cars, shouting along the way slogans such as "The government violently extorts house and shop donations, merchants should unanimously strike to resist." All shops in the city closed their doors and raised white cloth flags in front of the shops and on the upper floors, saying "We will not open the market until the house and shop donations are revoked." At 1:00 PM, the Fire Brigade of each shop also held a temporary meeting at the Xiapu Street Fire Brigade Federation, deciding that each brigade should summon support members (about a hundred people per brigade, with a total of thirty-six brigades in the city) to gather in the brigade and prepare to resist if the government forced the merchants to open their shops, so the situation was extremely serious. Unexpectedly, the government's attitude remained tough, and the police chief of the First Police Station, Shi Taizhen, was still sent to lead the police team to advise the merchants on Nan Street to open their shops, and he was surrounded and beaten, suffering serious injuries. The provincial government has ordered temporary martial law, and the turmoil is expanding. The third declaration against the heavy collection of house and shop donations issued by the Fire Brigade and Commercial Affairs Research Institute of each shop on the 15th is recorded below. This time, the Fujian Provincial Government, disregarding its prestige and disregarding the hardships of the people, heavily collected house and shop donations. The representatives of this association have repeatedly represented public opinion, requesting the authorities to withdraw their order, and have telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the fellow villagers associations in Shanghai and Beijing, as well as various dignitaries, calling for them to telegraph the provincial government immediately and cancel the cases. We have been running around and appealing, but there has been no result. Moreover, the government has stated that the Commercial Affairs Research Institute has not been recognized by the government, and the Fire Brigade is a charitable organization and has no qualifications to petition. The Minhou County Chamber of Commerce was instructed to inform us. The Commercial Affairs Research Institute and the Fire Brigade have a very deep relationship with the history of Fuzhou. Moreover, when the provincial government discussed collecting house and shop donations to suppress bandits during the rampant Red bandits two years ago, it sent a letter summoning each association to send representatives to the government to declare that it would only be collected once and would not be repeated. If each association is not sufficient to represent public opinion, then what is the purpose of the government's summons? The contradiction is the worst. Those who have not been recognized are nothing more than because each Commercial Affairs Research Institute has repeatedly represented public opinion and resisted miscellaneous taxes and harsh levies, incurring the anger of the authorities. However, the requests of each representative are purely to cancel this donation and have no other purpose. If one is punished for requesting, then what is the meaning of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine of people's rights? Recently, the House and Shop Donation Office has been sending people to forcibly collect donations from shops and residences in various places every day, and people in various places have been holding meetings to discuss this. They all believe that the authorities disregard their prestige and disregard the opinions of the people. All our citizens refuse to pay the house and shop donations and vow to die. If there is forced oppression, we can only make a final struggle within the scope of the law. We must achieve the goal of cancellation so that we will not sink into the endless sea of suffering in the future. No matter what, each citizen must have the will to persevere and the thought of not looking back. This association accepts the aforementioned intention, and in addition to continuing to present a request to the authorities for cancellation and re-telegraphing the central government for appeal, it will make another declaration. I hope you will understand. (15th)</p>
<h3>XU YUANQUAN SUPERVISES THE GENERAL ATTACK ON HE LONG'S BANDITS</h3>
<p>He Chengjun Goes to Shashi to Inspect Defenses</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: The remnant bandits of He Long's troops, after being fiercely suppressed by the Tenth Army, suffered extremely heavy losses. Now the bandits and the Duan Dechang faction are running around in central Hubei, eking out a living, and are no longer as rampant as they used to be. Xu Yuanquan, the commander of the Tenth Army and the deputy commander of the left route of bandit suppression, asked for instructions on the deployment of troops after Commander-in-Chief Chiang arrived in Hankou. On the 10th, he set off from Hankou with Chief of Staff Miao Songpei and others. On the 13th, he arrived in Yingcheng. In accordance with the original plan, he began the general attack on the 15th. Xu once gathered Xiao Zhichu, the commander of the Forty-fourth Division, Wan Yaohuang, the commander of the Thirteenth Division, Zhang Zhenhan, the commander of the Forty-first Division, Jiang Zuojun, the brigade commander, Liu Peixu, Huang Xin, Xu Jiwu, and Miao Songpei, the chief of staff of the Tenth Army, and others at Yuekou, and Zhu Huaibing, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, also participated. A general decision was made regarding post-bandit affairs in the bandit areas. First, in cooperation with the county magistrates and local impartial gentry, the restored people's regiments in each county will be sorted out and trained, and household registration, baojia, and the organization of anti-communist volunteer troops will be carried out to enable the people to obtain self-defense as soon as possible. After the meeting, a telegram was sent to the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, asking them to transfer orders to the county magistrates who had come to the province to return to their posts on a scheduled basis in order to achieve the effect of military-government cooperation. Yan Zhongmei, the secretary of the army, telegraphed Hankou from Yingcheng on the 15th, saying that the encirclement and suppression of the remnant bandits had been carried out in accordance with the Commander-in-Chief's methods, and it was expected that the remnant bandits could be annihilated in the shortest possible time. It was also said that according to the captured bandit troops, there was panic in the bandit's internal ranks, and ammunition and food were exhausted. In addition to tempting the people to join them with benefits, they also forced them to transport food for supply. Given the situation in the bandit areas, the general attack will surely have results. As for western Hubei, there are also remnant bandits who are causing trouble, and the Sichuan troops under Wang Lingji and Fan Shaozeng have advanced to suppress them. After Qianjiang was recovered, the bandits' power greatly declined. Now Wang has arrived in Shashi and is uniting with the Tenth Army to suppress the remnant bandits. He Chengjun, the Director of Pacification in Hubei and Commander of the Left Route of Bandit Suppression, went to Shashi by plane on the 15th with Zhu Chuanjing, the chief staff officer, Qiu Jia, the representative of the Twenty-first Army stationed in Hankou, Zhu Xiangwen, the section member of the Quartermaster Department of the Third Army, and others to inspect the defenses in western Hubei and to meet with Wang to discuss bandit suppression military affairs. It is said that he will return to Hankou within one or two days. During He's departure, the affairs of the Pacification Office will be handled jointly by Chief of Staff Yang Kuiyi and Office Director Chen Guangzu.</p>
<h3>HAN FUJU IS ABOUT TO RETURN TO JINAN</h3>

<h3>PROGRESS OF RECOVERY IN THE THREE COUNTIES OF JIADING, TAIHANG, AND BAOSHAN</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Construction Department Plans a Program</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, the towns in the counties of Jiading, Taicang, and Baoshan have been scarred and severely damaged. The Jiangsu Construction Department previously ordered the county heads to supervise the directors of the construction bureaus to investigate the actual damage in the towns under their jurisdiction in detail and submit the proposed repair plans for verification. Director Dong Xiujia also accompanied Provincial Government Chairman Gu Zhutong to Shanghai to personally inspect the actual situation in order to plan the entire program and seek active recovery methods. It is learned that the department has now drafted a construction and recovery program for the three counties and will submit it to the Provincial Government Committee for discussion, seeking to restore the original state as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, the aftermath of the Jiangnan Seawall Changtai Section project is divided into four sections. The Taicang Parade Ground, Daotang Temple, Fangjia Weir Bridge, and Yanglinkou sections have all started construction one after another. The Xuliujing section is scheduled to start construction on the 23rd of this month. The engineering office of this section has a post-disaster engineering office in Liuhe, with Director Qiu Xijue stationed there to supervise and facilitate the progress. (18th)</p>
<h3>Shi Ying's Report at the Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Rural Economic Panic and Its Remedial Measures</p>
<p>The Central Government's Office in Beijing held Premier's Memorial Week on the morning of the 18th. Those present included Shi Ying, Chen Lifu, Zheng Zhannan, Xie Zuomin, Zhang Daofan, Li Zonghuang, Huang Jichen, Xiao Jishan, Xiao Zhongzhen, Li Ciwen, and over 600 staff members. Chen Lifu presided over the event. Shi Ying gave a report titled "Rural Economic Panic and Its Remedial Measures," which briefly stated: Our country is based on agriculture, with farmers accounting for more than 80% of the total population. Therefore, the rural economy is the foundation of the national economy. However, in recent years, the rural economy has become increasingly panicked. If we do not make every effort to remedy this, the foundation of the national economy will be shaken. Even without foreign enemies, it would be enough to accelerate our demise. Moreover, at this time when the national crisis is becoming more urgent, facing both internal and external pressures, we are in a precarious state. However, there is currently no detailed investigation or statistics regarding the rural economy. Based on my personal observations, the causes of rural economic panic can be roughly divided into the following points: (1) Banditry, (2) Military disturbances, (3) Too many institutions and corrupt officials, (4) Heavy and complicated taxes, (5) Education not adapted to rural life, (6) Natural disasters, (7) Planting opium. In addition, the inability to fully control tariffs, the excessive naivety of farmers' knowledge, and the failure to improve agricultural technology are also causes of rural economic panic. As for agricultural products, the fact that there are too many farmers becoming bandits, soldiers, and idlers, or inconvenient transportation, or lack of capital, leading to reduced production and increased costs, are all closely related to the rural economy. Therefore, organizing credit cooperatives, establishing farmers' loan offices, developing transportation, improving farmers' agricultural knowledge, cultivating farmers' integrity, promoting farmers' self-defense, and implementing tariff protection policies are all essential measures to rescue the rural economy at present. The above are just the major points. As for the details, due to time constraints, I cannot describe them all. I hope everyone will pay attention to the approaching national crisis. While preparing for revenge, we should have a deep understanding of the phenomenon of rural economic panic and devise rescue strategies so that the countryside can have hope of revival. Then the foundation of the national economy can be consolidated, which is also our preparation for revenge."</p>

<h3>Chongming</h3>
<p>Three People Infected and Died in the Ship: A certain family in the western countryside of the county had an eight-year-old child who died of cholera at the home of relatives in Shanghai. The other day, three members of the family went to Shanghai to bring the child's coffin back to Chongming on the Dayun steamboat yesterday. After the ship left Shiliupu Guanqiao, before long, one of them suddenly contracted cholera. By the time it reached the Wusongkou, it was too late to save him, and he died. The other two also contracted the disease and died in the town and harbor of the county seat. It is indeed tragic that three members of one family died of the epidemic.</p>
<p>Confiscation of Smuggled Opium Pills: A certain inspector stationed at the Qiyao port of the Fifth Brigade of the Anti-Smuggling Unit of the Suzhou District in Chongming was selling red opium pills between Shanghai and Chongming, making considerable profits. The other day, a certain person carried a large quantity of opium and red pills at Pier No. 10 of Daguanqiao in southern Shanghai, intending to take a boat back to Chongming. This was detected by a certain inspector of the Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau's pier. The inspector boarded the ship for inspection and seized both the person and the goods, and brought them back to the bureau. The next day, he was sent to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Absconding with Stolen Money, Arrested in Xinzhuang: Zhu Baosan, a fellow from Xiashi and partner at Gu Wanyun's second-hand clothing store in Huayang, eastern suburbs, had been employed for many years and had always been considered honest. Recently, the store's new boat brought back more than 800 yuan from Shanghai. The partner was blinded by greed, found the key in the accounts, secretly took the money, and quietly left the store, whereabouts unknown. After the incident, the store owner immediately notified various places to investigate by long-distance telephone. It was then learned that the runaway partner was arrested by the police in Xinzhuang Town. According to his confession, after leaving the store, he walked to Xinzhuang, intending to take a car to Shanghai. Now, Hua Wenren, the patrol officer of the Xinzhuang branch, has prepared a document to be sent to the Songjiang County Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Resolution of the Resignation Case of Firefighting Members: The carelessness of the Dafeng Silk Store on West Street extended to the neighboring Tang Sanju Shoe Store. Subsequently, the shoe store owner made proposals regarding the post-disaster firefighting policy to the County Chamber of Commerce. Upon hearing of the original proposal, the firefighting members believed that it was insulting and unanimously decided that the store owner must publish an apology in the newspaper. After several negotiations, there was no result, which caused all the firefighting members to resign, resulting in a major dispute. It is now learned that this case has been mediated by mediators, and the store has agreed to publish an apology in the newspaper. The dispute between the firefighting association and the shoe store owner has also been resolved.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Grain-Borrowing Uprising in Zhenze Township: Zhenze Township, under the jurisdiction of Wujiang County, has a population of 16,000 to 17,000 households. Due to the failure of silk cocoons this year, the rural economy collapsed, causing more than 10,000 households to have difficulty making a living. The other day, more than 400 villagers flocked to a certain rice shop in the township, claiming to borrow 500 dan of rice, and forcibly took food from nearby food stores. The security team police came out to maintain order, and fortunately, there was no uprising. Subsequently, Wang, the county magistrate of Wujiang County, personally went to the town and convened a meeting of gentry and representatives of the people, and decided to allow each township to borrow 2,500 dan of rice to the villagers, but the township chief must be responsible for repaying it in winter. The funds will be raised by the gentry.</p>
<p>Brothel Keepers Beat Up Military Police: Prostitution and gambling in Suzhou have been ostensibly suppressed, but this is not the case in reality. Gambling dens such as those in Niujiaobang are still gambling heavily, there are still more than 100 opium dens, and prostitutes are everywhere. The other night (the 16th) at about nine o'clock, a certain military police inspector went to a brothel at No. 11 Lerongfang to investigate whether there were any soldiers prostituting there. He was scolded severely by a brothel keeper. At that time, they were taken to the police station where a peaceful settlement was reached. On the afternoon of the 17th at six o'clock, six military policemen went to inquire about what had happened the previous night. Unexpectedly, the brothel keeper, Xing Gen, gathered more than ten people, including Da Jinzi, and dragged the six military policemen to Fangli Lane and beat them severely. Fortunately, a neighbor reported to the police district, and the police were dispatched and arrested Yao Xinggen, Da Jinzi, Chen Baosan, Yao Zhou, and two other suspects and sent them to the police district for review and handling.</p>
<p>Cabby Rapes Eleven-Year-Old Girl: Li Ziwei's daughter, Jin Nan, age eleven, who lives in Tonglefang outside the Loumen gate, was discovered by her mother the other day with bloodstains on her crotch and behaving strangely. She was asked about it, but she steadfastly refused to tell the truth. When pressed, she finally said that on the 13th, she was lured by a cabby named Guo Zhichang to an open space in Sanliuwang and raped. Upon hearing this, Li Ziwei immediately searched everywhere and found Guo on the road at ten o'clock last night and took him to the police station. Guo confessed that there were more than ten children playing on my car in Tonglefang, so I pulled them to Sanliuwang, but there was no rape, and other such statements. The police station immediately transferred the case of rape of a young girl to the general bureau for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Extension of Time Limit for Redeeming Old Silk and Old Cocoons: The various money houses in our district had received a large number of old silk and old cocoons as collateral last year, and now the deadline has long passed. The mortgagors have delayed redeeming them, causing the financial stagnation of the various money houses, making it difficult to turn over. The money industry association has jointly requested the money industry association to convene a meeting of the industry to discuss and decide to limit the mortgagors to redeem from the various money houses before July 15. At the same time, it was submitted to the Department of Industry for record. After receiving the report, Director He immediately ordered the county to convene both the money and cocoon industries to properly discuss remedial measures. County Magistrate Chen convened the leaders of both industries at the Wenxi Hall in the county government yesterday morning (the 17th) to discuss everything. As a result, the silk and cocoon industry's request to extend the redemption deadline to the end of July was approved. The silk and cocoon industry association will notify its members to quickly find a way to redeem within the time limit, and at the same time appeal to the Department of Industry to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>Famine Relief Representatives Go to the Provincial Capital to Petition: The Temporary Famine Relief Association of our district held its fourth executive committee meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning (the 18th) at ten o'clock.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Public Security Branch Turmoil Subsides: A police officer in the first branch north of the city caused turmoil by accusing the branch chief, Li Mutang. On the 16th, County Magistrate Ma summoned more than ten leading patrolmen, including Li Chunshan and Hu Guirong, to lecture them in the main hall. Then, he ordered Wu Jigui, Xu Shuzhen, Yin Yonggui, You Guirong, and Li Chunshan to be interrogated by the Public Security Bureau to determine whether the six charges against Li Mutang were true. The five patrolmen fully admitted and claimed that it was the opinion of the entire group. They will be transferred to the county for interrogation on the 17th. Branch Chief Li Mutang has been transferred to the Qingyang second branch to exchange posts with Wang Hanchen. Patrol Officer Wang Hewu will exchange posts with General Bureau Patrol Officer Gu Shiming. Patrol Chiefs Wang Hongru and Jin Wenhai have been dismissed. The turmoil has come to an end.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Request to Punish Two Unlawful Officials: The Zhenjiang County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee stated that Chao Peizhi, a patrol officer of the Second Branch Office of the Third Branch Bureau of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, abused his authority and brutally tortured Zhang Defu, causing serious injuries. Xue Shenzhen, the director of the Third Branch Bureau, shielded his subordinates and detained Zhang Defu for four days, which violated the constitution. The committee dispatched member Bu Yulin to investigate and confirm the facts. Now, the actual situation of the investigation has been separately sent to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau and the Zhenjiang Local Court, requesting that they be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Project to Salvage the Yuzhang Battleship Halted: The Ministry of the Navy hired more than 200 workers from Hubei to come to Nantong to salvage the Yuzhang warship in the Lujinggang river area. After more than 20 days, the ship had just emerged from the water when the rope broke and it sank back to the bottom of the river. Currently, the river water is rising sharply and it is impossible to proceed. The project has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Inmates from Rugao and Haimen Prisons Transferred in Batches: The prisons in Rugao and Haimen counties have now been designated as sub-prisons of the Nantong Fourth Prison. Sun Xiong, the warden of the Fourth Prison, has gone to investigate the prisons. All male and female inmates who have been sentenced to more than three years will be transferred to Nantong, totaling more than 200 people.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>News of the Closure of Dengying School: Dengying Elementary School in this city, originally named the First Elementary School, was established with donations from the Hu family during the imperial examinations. It has been in operation for more than 20 years. Since Principals Zhang and Xu took over, Zhang was dismissed due to a criminal case, and Xu ran away due to deficits. The school's affairs have deteriorated day by day. Last year, Feng Fukui took over, but there was no improvement. Now, after the provincial school inspector inspected the school, he submitted a report to the department requesting that the school be ordered to close. Its students will be merged into the nearby Danghu Elementary School, to reduce expenses.</p>
<p>Strange Phenomenon of Selling Japanese Goods: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, in order to take care of the poor merchants, has allowed the merchants in this county who have Japanese goods to sell them all off within the month, and they will never be allowed to import them again. A certain amount will be extracted as anti-Japanese office expenses. However, since the start of the sale, more and more are being sold, and it is impossible to investigate. What is even stranger is that those whose original prices were more expensive but whose marked prices are low are all bought by relatives and friends and stored separately, so that they can be resold in the future under a different guise. The domestic goods that are slow to sell are put into the Japanese goods for sale. Also, most of them prepare two sets of books, cheating to avoid paying donations. Xu, the owner of a certain clothing store in Dongmen, is even more blatant, openly selling thousands of pieces of Japanese clothing materials imported from Shanghai. The industry has reported this to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for handling.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Homicide in Songxia: In Songxia, where Shaoxing and Shangyu meet, Wang Shuitang and Wang Yanliang, who are engaged in fishing, have long-standing grudges due to professional jealousy. The other day, in the afternoon, Wang Tingliang privately carried a handgun and shot Wang Shuitang to death. His son, named Erpang, was also seriously injured by the gun. The murderer immediately fled. The family has reported to the Shangyu Court, requesting that the murderer be arrested and punished.</p>

<h3>Joint Committee Still Difficult to Conclude Immediately</h3>
<p>Okazaki Visited Yu Hongjun Yesterday Morning to Discuss</p>
<p>The Issue of Troop Withdrawal from the Gongda and Toyota Factories</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement, it has been more than two months since the deadline on the day before yesterday, and the Japanese army has finally completely withdrawn. However, there are still 20 to 30 Japanese soldiers stationed in the Gongda and Toyota yarn factories, so it cannot be said that the original state before January 28 has been restored. Yesterday, Okazaki, the Japanese representative of the Joint Committee, went to see Mr. Yu Hongjun to discuss this matter, and promised that after consulting with the military authorities, the remaining Japanese troops at the two locations would be withdrawn. The Joint Committee also indicated that this matter still needs to wait until a considerable period of time before it can be concluded. The news is published below:</p>
<p>Okazaki Visits Yu: Okazaki, the Japanese representative of the Joint Committee, visited Mr. Yu Hongjun at the Municipal Government at 11:20 yesterday morning. After the meeting, Okazaki asked Mr. Yu: (1) When the Japanese troops withdrew from District D the other day, what was the process like? Is the Chinese side satisfied with it? (2) After the Japanese troops withdraw, please pay attention to protecting the Japanese residents in the area. Mr. Yu replied at the time that the withdrawal was generally good, and that the Japanese residents living in the area would be protected by us because of our responsibility. The Japanese side need not worry about this point.</p>
<p>Troops Stationed in the Two Factories: Regarding the withdrawal of troops stationed in the Gongda and Toyota yarn factories, our side originally intended to propose it to the Joint Committee together with the withdrawal of troops from District D. However, because the Japanese side had already withdrawn troops stationed in District D, it was stopped. However, there has not yet been a formal reply to the Gongda and Toyota yarn factories, so Okazaki, after talking about the previous points, declared to Yu that the troops stationed in the Gongda and Toyota yarn factories were to protect the property of the Japanese there. The number of people is no more than 20 to 30 in each yarn factory, and they are only limited to being stationed indoors and cannot go out. Although the Japanese side believes that there have been a small number of Japanese soldiers stationed at these two locations before January 28, the Japanese side is willing to consult with the military authorities to withdraw as soon as possible, hoping that the Chinese side will be more understanding. After listening to this, Mr. Yu stated to Okazaki that if the Japanese side's statement is sincere, then the Chinese side will be understanding. Please give a sincere reply from the Japanese side in the near future, otherwise it should be submitted to the Joint Committee. At 11:50, Okazaki resigned.</p>
<p>Tasks of the Joint Committee: Regarding the handling of the conclusion of the Joint Committee, according to the New Voice News reporter's interview with the person in charge of the committee yesterday, it was learned that the committee believes that the work has not been completed because the Japanese troops at the Gongda and Toyota yarn factories have not yet withdrawn, based on the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement, and must wait until a considerable period of time before a meeting can be held to handle the conclusion. The reporter then asked whether the Japanese side had indicated a date for the withdrawal of the Gongda and Toyota yarn factories. The spokesperson said that the Japanese side believes that it has the right to be stationed in the above two yarn factories, but the Chinese side requires its withdrawal. Therefore, the conclusion date of the Joint Committee cannot be realized at present. According to another spokesperson, according to the ceasefire agreement, the Gongda and Toyota yarn factories must be withdrawn. Although the Japanese side intends to stay for a long time, this is difficult to achieve in fact. The conclusion of the Joint Committee must be the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops to restore the original state before January 28. Therefore, the Japanese troops at the Gongda and Toyota yarn factories have not withdrawn, so it cannot be considered that the original state of Japanese troops before January 28 has been restored.</p>
<h3>The Takeover Committee Held a Closing Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Publish the Takeover Record to Announce Everything</p>
<p>The Japanese army stationed in Shanghai began to withdraw one after another after the signing of the ceasefire agreement. From May 5 to the day before yesterday, all Japanese soldiers have withdrawn. The Troop Withdrawal Area Takeover Committee organized by our side has also completed the takeover matters, so it is scheduled to end on the 24th of this month. Yesterday, the committee also reported the withdrawal situation in District D to the Executive Yuan. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Report to the Executive Yuan: After receiving District D tomorrow, the committee reported the entire process to the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, by telegram yesterday, because all tasks have been completed. The report included the withdrawal of the Japanese troops from District D, our takeover matters, and the general situation of the previous process, which was quite detailed.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting: The Takeover Committee held a closing meeting at the Joint Society on West Ames Road at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. The attending members were Guo Dehua, Wen Yingxing, Zhu Xibo, and four others. Han Deshen did not attend due to business. The meeting discussed the closing matters, and as a result, it was decided to close on the 24th, and it was also decided to hold a simple closing ceremony at the time of closing. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Announcement of the Process: After the committee closes on the 24th, although the takeover of Zhabei, Yinhang, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places has been disclosed in detail in various newspapers, there are still some points that have not been fully covered. Therefore, it is planned to publish a rare and systematic takeover record, announcing everything from the start of the Japanese army's withdrawal to the completion of the withdrawal, including all documents, inheritance, re-acceptance, and photos, etc., without exhaustive collection. It is expected to be published around the time of closing.</p>
<p>Disposal of Staff: The establishment of the committee was temporary in nature. When it was first established, it was jointly formed by staff members from various agencies, and many special commissioners and clerks were hired. Since the committee has ended, these staff members will be dismissed. However, the members will all return to their original positions in principle. For example, Director Yin Rugeng originally served as a counselor in the Municipal Government, Wen Yingxing originally served as the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Guo Dehua originally served as the secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Zhu Xibo originally served as the section chief of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Han Deshen originally served as the secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>Qian Zhongfu Talks About the Plight of Overseas Chinese in Nanyang</h3>
<p>Sugar Transport from Java Sharply Reduced</p>
<p>Chinese Goods Plundered by Japan</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, all industries have been affected, and shipping merchants are particularly affected. The Shanghai to Nanyang Islands route has been relatively prosperous in peacetime due to the transportation of sugar from Java and the travel of overseas Chinese. Now, its business has also declined. Mr. Qian Chongfu, a shipping merchant in Shanghai, made a special trip to Nanyang to inspect business affairs, inspect the sugar industry, and pay attention to overseas Chinese affairs. He has now returned to China and told reporters that the overseas Chinese in Java have suffered losses in the sugar industry and are unable to stand on their own. This matter is very important and must be retold as follows:</p>
<p>No One Buys Spot Sugar: Mr. Qian set off on June 9 and returned to China yesterday. This trip first went to Wangjiaxi, Surabaya, Sanbaolong, Jinglidan, Wanlong, Maowu, and Batavia. All major commercial ports in Java have been visited. The Java market is dominated by sugar production, 19% of which is in the hands of overseas Chinese. This year, the Shanghai war broke out, and the Yangtze River cannot transport sugar to the interior due to banditry. In addition, the silver and money industry does not release funds and has stopped handling sugar. After April, the import tax on sugar is 13 yuan and 5 jiao per dan, which is one and a half times higher than the price of sugar, resulting in the Java sugar market having no market price at all. The current stock of spot goods exceeds 2 million tons.</p>
<p>Sugarcane Fields Set on Fire: Since March, overseas Chinese firms in Java that operate the sugar industry have suffered unprecedented blows and have closed down one after another. Only two remain open. Most of the sugarcane fields in Java are owned by overseas Chinese. This year, when the sugarcane matured, many were unwilling to harvest it and make sugar because there was no way to sell the sugar. It would cost more than ten yuan per dan. When Mr. Qian was in Java, the overseas Chinese decided to set fire to the sugarcane planted in the fields. The flames soared into the sky and continued for several days.</p>
<p>Export Goods Seized by Japan: The largest exports from China to Java are cloth and soybeans. Now these two businesses have been taken away by the Japanese. After the three northeastern provinces were occupied, soybeans were transported from Dalian to Java, and piece goods were shipped from Japan. According to the leaders of the overseas Chinese in various parts of Java, overseas Chinese abroad are insulted in every way without the protection of a strong and powerful government. The motherland is in constant turmoil, and overseas Chinese have no place to stand. At present, 18 or 19% of the overseas Chinese businesses in Java have been taken away by the Japanese.</p>
<p>More and More Overseas Chinese Returning to China: There are more than one million overseas Chinese in Java, mostly from Guangdong and Fujian. Only about 1,000 people are from Shanghai and Shandong. Originally, the power in the Nanyang Islands was entirely in the hands of the Chinese. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war this year and the decline of the sugar industry, in the past four months, the overseas Chinese in Java have only returned to China and not entered the country. Even if there are occasional trips, it is the smallest number. If the country cannot be unified and there is another civil war, the overseas Chinese in Java will have no place to stand. Qian Qun also said that there is no wasteland in Java, no theft in the markets, and the roads are very wide and well-maintained. The doors can be left unlocked at night and there is no theft. This is because the territory does not allow the stay of unemployed foreigners.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan</h3>
<p>Xu Kan Returns to Beijing to Report</p>
<p>The Money Industry Held a General Meeting Last Night</p>
<p>The issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan has been decided in principle since Xu Kan, the director of the Coinage Department of the Ministry of Finance, was sent to Shanghai to discuss it. The situations of all parties are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Returns to Beijing: Since arriving in Shanghai, Xu Kan has repeatedly discussed everything with various circles in Shanghai. He also held a meeting at the Central Bank last week to discuss the issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan with Bei Songsun, Liu Hongsheng, Han Jingzhou, Hu Bijang, and others, deciding on the unification of the currency system and the manufacture of new coins, etc. Xu has been in contact for a long time and has obtained a result, so he will return to Beijing tomorrow night to report to the Ministry of Finance and then decide everything.</p>
<p>Contact Before Departure: Mr. Xu is going to Beijing with many important written opinions from all parties regarding the abolishment of taels and changing to yuan. He will also summarize the contributions of the bankers, and before leaving, for the sake of caution, he will contact Chen Xing of the Central Bank, Bei Songsun of the Bank of China, and others to discuss other unresolved issues. The results are all kept secret and cannot be announced.</p>
<p>Song Will Come to Shanghai: After Director Xu goes to Beijing, he will report the results of this contact in Shanghai to the Ministry of Finance. The reporter from Xin Sheng News learned from the banking industry yesterday that Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance, must also come to Shanghai within days to discuss the central government's opinions with the banking industry, and then make a final decision.</p>
<p>General Meeting of the Money Industry: The local Money Industry Association has expressed six opinions after the financial authorities announced that this issue will be re-implemented, and submitted them to the government for adoption. At 7:00 p.m. last night, an extraordinary general meeting of members was also convened to discuss this case. More than 100 representatives from various banks, including Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoting, and Li Zishan, attended. In addition to discussing various cases such as members' debts, the issue of abolishing taels and changing to yuan was discussed for a long time. According to Yu Zuoting, a standing committee member of the association, who spoke to the National News Agency reporter at the meeting last night, the money industry is in favor of abolishing taels and changing to yuan if it is to achieve a unified currency system. If the government has no standard measures for this case in advance, and implements it rashly, the financial world will inevitably experience great terror in the near future.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Attending the Opening of the Yingshi Memorial Hall</p>
<p>Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, previously traveled by plane to Wuhan with Minister Song to pay respects to Chairman Chiang, reporting on the issue of military expenses for suppressing bandits. After completing his official duties the day before yesterday, he returned to Nanjing by the same plane, arriving at 10:00 AM. In the evening, he took the express train on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway to Shanghai, arriving at the North Station at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. A reporter from the Central News Agency, upon hearing the news, went to interview him. He made the following remarks: (Reporter asked) Besides reporting on military expenses to Chairman Chiang in Wuhan, did you have any other missions? (Minister replied) This trip to Wuhan was solely for the military expenses issue; there were no other missions. I only stayed in Wuhan for one day before returning to Nanjing. (Asked) What is your mission in coming to Shanghai today? (Answered) The Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall is scheduled to hold its opening ceremony on the morning of the 19th. Chairman Chiang sent me here to participate. Fearing that I would not make it in time, I came to Shanghai a day early. (Asked) What is the situation with the bandits in Jiangxi Province recently? Is it true that Da Yu and Nankang have not been relieved, as reported in yesterday's newspaper? (Answered) The situation with the bandits in Jiangxi Province has not changed recently. Our armies are cooperating to suppress them, and there are new deployments. Da Yu and Nankang have not been besieged. Recently, near Shuikou in Nanxiong, Guangdong troops and the Red bandits had a brief encounter, but they were ultimately defeated by us. Our army, Zhang Meixin's division, suffered several hundred casualties, but this is a necessary phenomenon during suppression operations. The Red bandits' casualties are usually several times higher than ours. (Asked) How many days will you be staying in Shanghai, and when will you return to Jiangxi? (Answered) I will return to Nanjing after attending the memorial hall ceremony. The date of my return to Jiangxi is not yet determined, as the affairs of the Ministry of Military Affairs are more important and need to be handled in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>The Yingshi Memorial Hall Holds Its Opening Ceremony Today</h3>
<p>The Lake Society previously received an order from the National Government to establish the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall within the society. A site was selected at the intersection of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road for construction. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 18, 1920. It has now been completed and is scheduled to hold the completion and opening ceremony at 9:00 AM today. Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin and Acting President of the Legislative Yuan Shao Yuanchong will both participate.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan and Others Leave Hong Kong to Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai on the President Hoover on the 21st</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, Chen Liting, Cha Liangzhao, and San Bi, who went to Guangdong to petition, have completed their mission and are scheduled to return to Shanghai from Hong Kong today. The Anti-Civil War League received a telegram from Zhu, saying, "Returning to Shanghai this year, (17th) going to Macau, (19th) returning to Shanghai on the Hoover, Qinglan." According to news from the China Travel Service yesterday, the President Hoover that Zhu is traveling on is scheduled to enter the port on the 21st. Zhu sent a letter to a friend in Shanghai, briefly stating that when they arrived in Guangdong, the two Chens had already resolved peacefully. Some influential figures in Guangdong Province suspected that Qinglan had other motives, but after explanation, the misunderstanding was cleared. Negotiations for the non-war movement in various places are progressing smoothly. The Anti-War League conference is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on August 6th.</p>
<h3>Joint Telegram from Public Organizations</h3>
<p>The Loss of Territory is Imminent</p>
<p>Compatriots Across the Country Must Rise Up Together</p>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Association of Public Organizations sent a telegram yesterday regarding the recovery of lost territories in the Northeast, saying: To all public organizations and newspapers across the country: Since the incident in the Northeast, the officials responsible for defending the territory have advocated a policy of non-resistance to the enemy. In less than a day, thousands of miles of territory were lost. The government procrastinated and made empty promises of long-term resistance, while watching the failure of the Shanghai War, allowing the Japanese invaders to establish a puppet state at their leisure. The policy of the Japanese imperialists to first destroy the Northeast and then annex the mainland of China can be said to have largely succeeded. Now that the puppet state has been established, the fascist movement of the military阀 in Japan is like a raging fire. Their desire to invade China is urgent. It is widely rumored that in September, they will use the puppet state of Puyi to advance into Pingjin and spy on North China under the guise of restoring the Qing Dynasty. Judging from the rumors before the Northeast and Shanghai incidents, it cannot be said that all of them are groundless. Recently, the Vice Minister of the Japanese Staff, Masaki, personally went to Manchuria, reportedly to plan this matter. The Japanese army is now forcibly conscripting young men in the Northeast to train 250,000 troops in the name of the puppet state, as preparation for invading the interior. Our Northeastern civilian volunteer army is fighting bravely and bitterly, fighting against powerful enemies with flesh and blood, but the government turns a blind eye, acting as if nothing has happened. The soldiers are arrogant, cruel, and indulgent as before. Once the Japanese invaders drive in, North China will perish with the Northeast, the rivers and mountains will change hands, and the loss of territory is imminent. We hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up together. There is a government willing to perish the country, but there are no people willing to be slaves. Quickly seek a way of self-salvation and self-determination. Shanghai Joint Association of Public Organizations.</p>
<h3>Wang Hanchen, Executive Committee Member of Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, Goes to Southeast Asia to Promote Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>Wang Hanchen, Executive Committee Member of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, came to Shanghai yesterday to expand domestic trade. He went to the Shanghai Federation of Domestic Goods Factories to solicit samples, saying that he brought various domestic cloths and planned to promote them in Southeast Asia. He had already made proper arrangements. In Southeast Asia, after the January 28th Incident, the enthusiasm for using domestic goods was even greater than before. It is hoped that all kinds of daily necessities can be replaced by domestic goods. After a brief gathering in Shanghai, he plans to depart in about four or five days.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Justice to Revise the Shanghai Special District Court Agreement</h3>
<p>To Make it a Purely Chinese Court</p>
<p>Free From Foreign Interference and Restraint</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency said that the Local Court of the Special District of the Public Concession in Shanghai is the reorganized former Provisional Court. At the beginning of the establishment of the court, it was taken back from foreigners, so an agreement was signed with the relevant countries. Next April, the agreement will expire, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration is preparing to revise the agreement so that it will no longer be restricted by foreigners and become a purely Chinese court. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency went to the court to inquire yesterday, and the information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Court Retrospective The Shanghai Special District Court was first established during the late Qing Dynasty, and was called the Mixed Court. It specialized in hearing Chinese cases and Chinese-foreign cases that occurred in the Public Concession. At that time, the judges were jointly judged by Chinese officials and consuls, but the power was in the hands of the Chinese officials. Since the rise of the Revolutionary Army and the establishment of the Republic of China, the presiding judge of the court, a Manchu, fled in the night, and there was no one in charge of the court. The Public Works Department took over and paid all the arrears of wages of the court staff, and at that time, the power fell into the hands of foreigners. Since then, all trials have only listened to the consuls, and from time to time, the spirit of our country's laws has been destroyed, and a malformed judicial institution has been formed. Although our authorities have strived to recover it, it has been to no avail.</p>
<p>Preliminary Recovery In 1926, during the era of Sun Chuanfang, representatives were sent to negotiate with consuls of various countries to implement the takeover. The result was that the takeover was implemented in the following year (1927), and it was reorganized into a provisional court for a period of three years. Its organization was like the era of the Mixed Court, only the power of judgment was in the hands of our Chinese judges. However, when the police station brought Chinese-foreign cases, the consular jury still appeared in court to participate in the judgment. In addition to the judge's instructions, the foreign consul's signature was still required, and the power of arrest and investigation remained in the hands of the police station. What we recovered was only a part of the right of judgment. At that time, the deadline was three years, and then a further reorganization was carried out.</p>
<p>Current Situation In 1930, the term of the Provisional Court expired. Xu Mo and others were sent by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to negotiate with the consuls of various countries to revise the agreement. On April 1st, the agreement was established and reorganized into the Special District Local Court. The appellate agency for second-instance cases of the Provisional Court was originally the Court of Appeal, but now it has been reorganized into the Second Branch of the High Court, and everything inside is more advanced than in the Provisional Court. All kinds of judicial powers are completely handled by our side. The unique points from the previous one are the cancellation of the consular jury system and the recovery of the coroner's office. What is still inferior to a purely Chinese court is that the rights of the police are in the hands of the police station. Police officers are all recommended by the police station. Although the court has a prosecutor's office, due to the relationship of the agreement, only Articles 103 to 186 of the criminal law are investigated and prosecuted by the prosecutor. The remaining articles are still handled by the police station.</p>
<p>Proceeding with Revision Recently, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has prepared to discuss the revision of the agreement with the relevant countries when the agreement expires on April 1 next year. According to Wei Wanqian, the clerk of the court, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has not yet issued an order on the revision of the agreement. Generally, when the revision is made in the future, the first step is to make the police power convenient for the court to command and not be restricted. The others are the exercise of prosecutorial power, etc., to make it a purely Chinese court.</p>
<p>Fundamental Issues The reporter then visited a senior official of the court, who said that after the expiration of the agreement, the revision of the agreement should be carried out. Police power is also an important issue, but the fundamental issue is still the recovery of the concession. Although the judicial police in the current court are employed by foreigners, the number is small, only more than 20 people. Even if they are recovered in the future, there will only be more than 20 people, and the search and arrest outside must be assisted by the police station. The court cannot directly command.</p>

<h3>The Cross-Border Road Construction Case Will Continue to be Discussed Soon</h3>
<p>Fei Xinhan Arrived at the Bureau Yesterday to Work</p>
<p>After both parties met once in the last period to discuss the cross-border road construction case, our side has conducted a precise study of the three points requested by the Public Works Department. As for the results, Yu Hongjun told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday that our side believes that any points of the Public Works Department's proposed amendments that hinder our sovereignty are unacceptable. According to the New Voice News Agency, Fei Xinhan, the representative of the Public Works Department, has been ill for several days. Yesterday, Mr. Fei Xinhan recovered slightly and arrived at the bureau in the morning to work. However, he was unable to work in the afternoon. Therefore, after lunch, Mr. Fei did not go to the Public Works Department to work. It is expected that both parties will have to wait one or two days for Mr. Fei to recover before continuing to discuss the amendment of the draft.</p>
<h3>The Food Committee Resolved on Measures to Regulate Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Requesting the Municipal Government to Purchase Large Quantities of Rice</p>
<p>Requesting the Central Government to Impose a Tax on Food Imports</p>
<p>The Municipal Food Committee held its 35th regular meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 2:00 PM on the 16th. The attendees were Zhang Laihui, Wu Guiyu, Sun Yongyi, Wu Juenong, Zhu Zixiang, and ten other members. Those attending as observers included rice industry representatives Gu Xinyi, Fu Zisheng, Fu Qiangeng, and three others. Chairman Zhang Laihui and recorder Zhou Minggang performed the formalities. First, the chairman reported (1) that the resolutions of the previous meeting had been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval, (2) that the postponement of the implementation of the new municipal peck system had been ordered to be difficult to approve, (3) that the rice of the storage association had lost more than 200,000 yuan according to the current market price, and it was proposed to sell it off with pain, which had been submitted to the municipal government for approval, (4) that committee member Ye Huiwen had many plans for the association's affairs, and had passed away due to illness yesterday, and all committee members were requested to stand in silence to express their condolences. Then, they discussed the proposal by committee members Zhu Zifan and Yan Xiaoquan that rice prices had plummeted, and farmers and merchants were frequently going bankrupt, so the municipal government should be requested to find a way to maintain it, and the proposal by committee member Gu Fu to request that rice merchants be persuaded to stop fresh rice, which were of the same nature, were discussed together. Measures to regulate rice prices were immediately resolved. (1) Submit to the municipal government to request the Shanghai and Baoshan counties should allocate a part of their accumulated funds to borrow cash from the silver and money industries to purchase rice in storage to maintain market prices. At the same time, rice merchants will voluntarily donate a storage fund of five cents per stone for a period of two years as a guarantee. If there is a loss, the money will be used to offset it. If there is a surplus, it will be allocated to the storage fund to complete the city's rice warehouse. (2) According to the old case of the association, submit to the central government to instruct the financial organs to levy a tax on food imports to show restrictions, and submit them for separate handling.</p>
<h3>Xu Guangde Discusses Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan</h3>
<p>Our country's currency system regulations were promulgated and implemented as early as the third year of the Republic of China. In theory, the national currency should be based on silver yuan as the standard currency. Today, there should be no more questions about abolishing taels and changing to yuan. However, in fact, in Shanghai, the sycee tael is used as the calculation currency standard, and its power is far above the silver yuan. Due to the shift in Shanghai's trade power, various ports along the Yangtze River and the coast almost recognized the sycee tael as an indispensable calculation standard. In the spring and summer of this year, suddenly due to various reasons, the market price of silver yuan has fallen from seven qian three fen to about six qian eight fen. The general financial circles are thinking of saving this situation, and they all agree that taking advantage of this opportunity, we should resolutely abolish taels and change to yuan, and consult with the central authorities to proceed with steps in order to realize it. From this point of view, its motivation is to save the market price of silver yuan and avoid further decline. Its purpose is to unify the currency system. The method is appropriate and there is nothing to discuss. What I want to discuss now is not whether to reform, but the advantages and disadvantages of the reform. The sycee tael is a virtual standard, and the reason why its circulation power can last for a long time must have its reasons for existence. My opinion is that the reason why the sycee tael can maintain its circulation power in our country's largest commercial port for a long time is nothing more than the following three reasons: (1) All circles in Shanghai are deeply rooted in the habit of using sycee taels. (2) The intermediaries in the general financial circles in Shanghai have special interests in silver. (3) Throughout history, the government has had weak strength in reorganizing the currency system and has no consistent policy. Now, please explain the above three points and contribute my humble opinions, which are also a research material in the voice of abolishing taels and changing to yuan.</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai's Habit of Using Sycee Taels The reason why the sycee tael can occupy a great influence in Shanghai's business is that the international exchange rate has used the sycee tael as Shanghai's standard currency for nearly 80 years. Seventy-six years ago, Shanghai did not have the name of sycee tael for its currency. At that time, Chinese and foreign trade mostly used foreign currencies, and the most popular ones were Spanish and Mexican (i.e. foreign) silver yuan. At first, Spanish silver yuan was the most popular. Later, Spanish silver yuan gradually decreased. The existing goods were scarce, and the market price of water rose day by day. Compared with Mexican silver yuan, the water even rose to about 40%. Therefore, in 1856, Shanghai's merchants changed Spanish silver yuan from hard currency to accounting currency, named sycee tael. The hard currency in circulation on the market was Mexican silver yuan. At that time, one Mexican silver yuan was worth 7 jiao 2 fen 4 li 3 hao Spanish silver yuan. According to this ratio, one Mexican silver yuan was valued at 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 3 hao of sycee tael. Therefore, Shanghai's two units of currency started in 1856. Nearly 80 years have passed. Although the sycee tael is a virtual standard currency, its credit can be permanently maintained. There are still two reasons: A, cash reserves, B, the credit of money houses. Regarding point A, because the sycee tael is a virtual standard currency, if there is a considerable amount of silver bullion prepared, it will not be the lack of uneven color and weight. It is a kind of centripetal force in habit. Once the habit changes, there will be no difficulty. Regarding point B, the usual silver bullion reserves include raw silver and large bars of silver, which account for less than one-tenth of the sycee taels received and redeemed in the market. The rest relies on the credit of money house notes to maintain turnover.</p>
<p>(2) Special Interests of Intermediaries in the Financial Sector The greatest interest of the money house in using both taels and yuan seems to be the handling fee of two hao and a half. This fee is calculated from each conversion, which is a huge amount. Once taels are abolished and changed to yuan, it will be completely sacrificed. In addition, money house notes have always been the most widely circulated credit currency in Shanghai's import trade. The power of banknotes issued by Chinese banks is far less popular than money house notes. On the one hand, it is said that the money house is an organization with unlimited liability, but a part of the reason is that the source of money house notes is very far away. The general social belief is that money house notes can represent sycee taels. Once sycee taels are abolished, the circulation of bank notes may also increase. The money industry may be affected in another way in terms of business. Foreign banks have always used sycee taels as the standard currency for international exchange. If taels are abolished and yuan are used, there is no major relationship, but there is less a virtual standard currency in exchange, which is less than the two conversion opportunities of sycee taels and silver yuan before the reform. In terms of collection and payment procedures, there is one less handling fee. This is the general situation of the special interests of sycee taels and intermediaries.</p>
<p>(3) The Government's Weak Strength in Reorganizing the Currency System and Lack of Consistent Policy When it comes to the government, the minting of silver coins is handled by the central government. All mints are under the jurisdiction of the central government. If the color and weight are handled seriously, it is not impossible to completely unify the silver yuan. The reason why foreign merchants opposed abolishing taels and changing to yuan in the past was that the central government was weak, and the mints in various provinces manufactured themselves without unification. Once the silver yuan becomes the unit of currency exchange in various countries, if there is a slight difference in the color and weight of the standard currency, it will inevitably affect international trade. This reason can no longer be established now, because in fact, our country's silver coins have all been handled according to the standard color of the sycee tael stipulated in the currency system regulations, but there are still things that should be considered. How much hard currency is currently circulating in the market in our country? Although the Ministry of Finance has not released accurate statistics, according to general estimates, it is about 170,000,000 yuan. If this number is correct, whether it is enough is still a question. If there is not enough hard currency, it must be supplemented with banknotes. We must unify the right to issue them and strictly determine the reserve method. Otherwise, we are afraid that there will be incidents of excessive issuance of banknotes, which will affect the soundness of the silver standard.</p>
<p>To sum up the above three points, Shanghai is the financial center of the country. Silver and foreign currency have been used for decades. The general public knows that it is a malformed currency, but since it has become a habit, once it is abolished, there will naturally be many inconveniences in the transition, and we should endure a little pain and agree to it. The money industry should also understand the trends of modern times, resolutely give up the special interests in the exchange of silver taels and silver yuan, and cooperate with the government and domestic banks to achieve the goal of unifying silver yuan. As for the government, it should also promptly urge the Shanghai Mint to realize the start of production of coins, in order to permanently maintain the standard color and weight of silver yuan. On the one hand, the mints in various provinces, such as the Tianjin, Nanjing, and Hangzhou plants, should be designated as branches of the central mint, or merged in order to unify them. At the same time, we must urgently crack down on the excessive issuance of banknotes to avoid the occurrence of unsound conditions in the currency system.</p>

<h3>The Retail Department of the Sanyou Industrial Society on Nanjing Road Was Still Temporarily Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Will Summon Both Parties for Questioning Today</p>
<p>After a dispute over the closure of the Sanyou Industrial Society factory in Yinxiang Township occurred, the retail department on Nanjing Road was temporarily closed due to workers surrounding and petitioning. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting to question both labor and management today. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Closure Situation Yesterday, the iron doors of the retail department of the Sanyou Industrial Society at No. 497 Nanjing Road were tightly closed. At the back door of Yuxing Lane, two armed Chinese police officers were stationed by the Zhabei Police Station. At No. 21 Niuzhuang Road, the first dormitory, one Chinese police officer was stationed for protection. At 10:00 AM, the Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Trade Union dispatched Wu Renfu, Kuang Yuanlong, Yuan Zhixian, Xu Lijin, etc. to the retail department to continue to petition Associate Manager Wang Xianhua. Because Wang had gone out, they could not get any results and then withdrew.</p>
<p>Executive Yuan Letter The municipal government received a letter from the Executive Yuan's Office, saying, "I hereby inform you that according to a telegram from the Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Trade Union, it is submitted that the Sanyou Industrial Society has suspended work, and thousands of workers are in a desperate situation. Now the employer wants to destroy the labor movement during the national crisis, please severely punish it. It should be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Government and informed to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce." In addition to sending a separate letter to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the original document is enclosed for reference.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Order The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau ordered the Sanyou Industrial Society and the Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Trade Union yesterday, saying, "In order to comply with the order, it is found that the labor dispute over the suspension of the Shanghai General Factory of the company was previously mediated by the bureau's Mediation Committee but failed. It has been submitted to the municipal government for arbitration. It has been instructed to re-follow the disposal and instructed to re-follow the mediation. The bureau has now scheduled a meeting to question at 9:00 AM on the 19th of this month. In addition to separate orders, it is ordered to comply with the order, immediately dispatch a responsible representative and come to the bureau on time.</p>
<p>Company Losses The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting to question both labor and management at 9:00 AM today. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Party Department were specially notified to send personnel to participate in the joint handling. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with a staff member of the Sanyou Industrial Society yesterday, who said that the retail department had suffered heavy losses after it was announced to temporarily close due to workers surrounding and petitioning. The daily retail income was usually more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to Properly Mediate the Dafeng Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Workers Continued to Petition the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>The unemployed workers of the Shanghai West Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory demanded to resume work, resulting in a conflict between workers and police. The 15 arrested workers have been sent to court for trial. The workers continued to petition yesterday. The municipal government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to properly mediate.</p>
<p>Continuing to Petition At 8:00 AM yesterday, the Third District Dyeing Industry Trade Union gathered more than 100 workers and went to the municipal government to continue their petition, demanding the immediate release of the arrested workers and the restoration of the jobs of the unemployed workers. They sent representatives Zhang Hongtong and others to pay a visit, and Section Chief Wang Shaojie received and answered each item: (1) The release of the arrested workers is a judicial matter and has been sent to the court. It is only allowed for the municipal government to send a letter to the court to leniently handle the workers who have been unjustly accused. (2) The labor dispute has been ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate properly, but the petitioning workers insisted on immediate release. Later, they were dispersed by police officers. Then, the workers gathered on the road behind the Finance Bureau.</p>
<p>Dispersed in the Afternoon The Dafeng petitioning workers gathered at the municipal government and insisted on not leaving. Zhu Xuefan, Li Yongxiang, and other members of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions went to the municipal government at 11:00 AM yesterday to visit Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and find a way to dredge the situation in order to resolve it as soon as possible. Secretary-General Yu replied, requesting that the issue of restoring the jobs of unemployed workers has been ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau to handle it, hoping to advise the workers to wait patiently for the processing. The issue of assaulting police officers is an insult to administrative staff, and the municipal government has sent it to the local court for handling according to law. However, the request for bail has been sent to the court, and the municipal government cannot comply with it, but the workers' knowledge is simple, and the municipal government is very forgiving. Therefore, it has notified the court to consider the situation and leniently handle it. Then, the Federation of Trade Unions tried its best to persuade the workers, and they dispersed at 1:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Instructions The Municipal Government obtained information from the petitioning workers of the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory requesting to restore the work of 108 workers who were unemployed due to the war. In order to resolve it quickly and avoid the expansion of the labor unrest, it specially instructed the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to properly mediate. It is heard that the bureau, after receiving the order, has decided to handle it according to law in the shortest period. Xu Yefu, chief of the Third Section, has designated staff to handle it.</p>
<h3>Regarding Rent Reduction, a Re-examination of Rent Reduction Measures is Requested</h3>
<p>The Municipal Citizens' Rent Reduction Movement Committee, considering the four rent exemption standards announced by the Municipal Government on the 8th of this month to be biased and unfair, has presented the facts and earnestly requests the Municipal Government to retract its decree and formulate a new one. Simultaneously, it has also submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters, urging a unified stance to comfort the people's hopes. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Submitting a report that the announced rent exemption standards are biased and unfair, presenting the facts, and earnestly requesting a retraction of the decree and a re-formulation to ensure fairness and comfort the people's hopes. On the 9th of this month, the report stated that your esteemed government's No. 28 announcement outlined four rent exemption standards. After reading them, the public was bewildered. In recent days, various groups of tenants from Zhabei, Pudong, the Nanshi, and the Central District have come to the association to question and express indignation. The association, after carefully considering the situation and based on past facts, also feels that the standards set by your esteemed government are biased and unfair, easily leading to disputes. Regarding what we have observed, we state the following: (1) In the areas of Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei, your esteemed government stipulates a three-month rent exemption. However, the Japanese army invaded on January 28th, so the so-called three months should refer to February, March, and April. However, investigations reveal that our side did not complete the takeover of Wusong and Zhabei until June 17th. Before the takeover was completed and the Japanese army had not completely withdrawn, the tenants in the Wusong and Zhabei areas, according to the legal principle of "use and benefit," found it difficult to use and benefit from their residences in May and June. Now, they are unexpectedly required to bear rent from May onwards, which is truly perplexing. (2) In the special district north of the Suzhou River and west of Yokohama, your esteemed government stipulates two and a half months. The area north of the Suzhou River and west of Yokohama refers to the Hongkou area. This area was the Japanese army's operational base. The various cruel actions have been reported in newspapers and are countless. Therefore, many residents have not dared to move back even after evacuation. Even in terms of shops, although the Central District announced the resumption of business on April 1st, this area barely opened its doors in early May. Therefore, the exemption of rent for May is also a matter of course. (3) In the special district east of Yokohama, the Yangshupu area, only a two-month rent exemption is granted. The Yangshupu area was also a Japanese military operational base. The Public Grand Yarn Factory was the Japanese army's headquarters, and the situation was no better than in Zhabei and Hongkou. Therefore, normal conditions did not return in April. Why is only a two-month exemption granted? This is unfair. (4) The parts of South Shanghai and Pusong District north of the Suzhou River are generally exempted for one month, which is too vague. First, regarding South Shanghai, since the Japanese army invaded Zhabei, South Shanghai has been in frequent turmoil. Even your esteemed government and its subordinate bureaus and offices moved into the special district to work, which shows how critical the situation was. After the resumption of business on April 1st, the Nanshi area was still fearful day and night because the Japanese army in Zhabei had not withdrawn. It was not until the settlement was signed that the area became slightly stable. Therefore, the tenants' lack of use and benefit of their houses was probably not limited to one month in February. The part north of the Suzhou River is too broad and not fair. For example, the area around North Henan Road is also north of the Suzhou River. When did the Municipal Chamber of Commerce move back to work? This area was still in a state of terror in March. How could it be used and benefited? A one-month rent exemption is not fair. (5) The Central and Western districts of the Public Concession and the French Concession, as well as the Pudong area, are not included, which is unfathomable. If it is said that these two areas are safe areas, then the bombs that fell on Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, the destruction of the Wing On No. 3 Factory on McTaggart Road, and the bombing of the French Concession were all common occurrences. Furthermore, shops were closed, factories were shut down, and the entire situation was no different from a war zone. It was clear that people could not live and work in peace. If it is said that it does not meet the regulations of use and benefit, then in the presence of enemy troops and flying shells, could the people's rental houses achieve the purpose of use and benefit, even though government organs were constantly moving? Or it is said, why didn't the tenants terminate their leases at that time? The transportation was obstructed at that time, and Shanghai was a place where people from all walks of life were mixed. Could leases be terminated with a single word? However, the fact that hundreds of thousands of people moved to other cities shows that it was not an absolutely safe area, but for the sake of the entire national spirit, long-term resistance, common defense against insults, and the decades of historical reasons for the Shanghai market, they could not all escape. Therefore, from the closure of the Central District from February to the resumption of business on April 1st, rent should be exempted at least according to this standard to be fair. Furthermore, regarding Pudong, although it was not a war zone, the bombing by airplanes was heard every day when the war broke out. Also, Japanese soldiers were stationed at companies such as Qichang Mitsui and Laobaidu Riqing. Japanese troops landed in places such as Takahashi. Therefore, the closure of shops and the evacuation of residents were undeniable facts. Why did your esteemed government regard them as outside the pale of civilization and not take them into account? The above statements are based on past facts and are in line with what your esteemed government calls "the use and benefit of the leased property is a prerequisite for the payment of rent, which is expressly stipulated in law and should be understood in reason." If it is not used and benefited, rent should naturally be exempted. This is the logical conclusion. Now, let us make another statement to your esteemed leader on the principle of rent reduction and exemption. A. Since the January 28th Incident, the social and economic situation has plummeted. The demand for rent reduction and exemption is nothing more than a remedy for the post-war economy, so as to ease the people's difficulties and facilitate their recovery. It is not intended to impose responsibility or burden on any party. Your esteemed government's announcement said, "The burden of this disaster should not be entirely placed on the property owners." In other words, the burden of this disaster should be entirely placed on the tenants? In short, during times of national crisis, all citizens should share both good and bad fortune, just as rights and obligations are equal to each other. Now, residents and shops have closed down, lost their jobs, and suffered losses due to the national crisis, which is already terrible. Property owners still enjoy income and bear no burden. In terms of the equality of rights and obligations, how can it be said to be fair? B. Your esteemed government's announcement said, "The property situation in this city is complicated, and the economic capacity of the property owners may not be as the residents say." This is even more perplexing. The property situation in this city is indeed complicated, but the reason for its complexity is that the property owners regard real estate as an investment business. Each transfer and each increase in value have created today's situation. This not only violates the essence of our Prime Minister's legacy of equalizing land rights, but also promotes the evil forces of capital monopoly. How should the revolutionary government fulfill its mission, strictly crack down on it, and prevent the Three Principles of the People from becoming a mere formality, so that the suffering of the people can be alleviated? Why should it only defend the interests of the property owners? Furthermore, since your esteemed government knows the economic capacity of the property owners, why doesn't it know the economic capacity of the tenants, and why doesn't it consider the overall social and economic capacity at present? Taking all these points into consideration, who would believe that your esteemed government is not partial to the property owners? C. Your esteemed government's announcement focuses on rent exemption and does not mention rent reduction at all. The high cost of rent in Shanghai is unprecedented in the country. The property owners use the excuse of increasing land value, but they do not know that the increase in land value is caused by the property owners using real estate as a speculative business. This kind of abnormal development should be suppressed, and especially after the war, the social and economic capacity is far from what it used to be. Rent should be reduced in a timely manner to alleviate the burden on the people. Nanjing, Hangzhou, Anqing, and other places also automatically reduced rent one after another in the rear. This city has suffered more than 30 days of artillery fire. Even if the rent reduction and exemption measures publicly formulated by the entire city are strictly implemented, I am afraid that the effect will not be much. Now, only a few months of rent is exempted. How can this make up for the recovery of industry and commerce? D. Renting a house is originally a contract, but rent reduction and exemption are not purely a rental dispute. According to the case of Tongchunfang, the court's judgment stated, "If the rent reduction and exemption movement can become a reality and be promulgated by a competent authority, it can be recognized as having the effect of excluding general laws. Then the tenant can deduct the rent." It clearly recognizes that rent reduction and exemption are not a legal contractual relationship. Otherwise, why would the promulgation of laws and regulations by the competent authority be able to exclude the effectiveness of general laws? Why would your esteemed government issue an announcement? Furthermore, in the previous talks convened by your esteemed government between property owners, tenants, and other relevant parties, Secretary-General Yu made the following statements: (1) The principle of receiving rent exemption is an indisputable fact between both parties. (2) The standards proposed by the Rent Reduction and Exemption Association will be given to the property owner representatives for reference, and a reply must be submitted before the 25th. (3) Before the announcement, all parties will be convened again to discuss and decide. Now, what has been announced violates the principle of rent exemption and has not fulfilled the promise of consultation and decision-making, resulting in criticism. The association also feels unable to explain itself. Therefore, we dare to state the various points and submit them to your esteemed leader, hoping that you will uphold your original intention of relieving the suffering of the people, retract the announced standards, consider the facts, solicit opinions from all parties, and formulate a new one to calm public anger and comfort the people's hopes. With the utmost urgency, we await your orders. Respectfully submitted to Wu, the Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government. (The document submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters is the same, omitted.)</p>

It is said that the registration will close soon. Those who are interested in serving and willing to receive military training should quickly report to the team's headquarters on the third floor of No. 11 Hankou Road, otherwise they will inevitably feel regret.</p>

<h3>Japanese Rogues Collude with Chinese to Sell Green Gas Guns</h3>
<p>Seized at the New Hui Zhong Hostel</p>
<p>Three Japanese and Two Chinese Arrested</p>
<p>The Narcotics Division of the Shanghai Municipal Police, having recently learned that Japanese rogues were colluding with Chinese to organize a gun trafficking ring, possessing all kinds of military equipment and secretly selling green gas guns, which are strictly prohibited by the international community, dispatched detective Song Bingzheng, Chen Huiting, and Ding Yugao to act as military officers. They repeatedly went to Room 511 on the fifth floor of the Huizhong Hostel on Hankou Road to contact the leaders of the Chinese and Japanese smugglers to purchase a large number of military equipment. After more than ten days of negotiations, everything was basically ready, and they were only waiting to pay and deliver the goods. At 9:20 am yesterday, Song and other detectives, together with Pan Gentong, the Western Detective Chief, rushed to the hostel to investigate and arrest them. Three Japanese and two Chinese, Xu Zailin and Tian Chunyi, were arrested on the spot. Nine green gas guns, large, medium, and small, more than 200 bottles of green gas liquid, a submachine gun, more than 500 bullets, and several sample books of various pistols were seized and taken to the Old Gate Patrol Station. After questioning, the head of the patrol ordered the three Japanese to be handed over to the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai for interrogation, and the two Chinese, Xu and Tian, were temporarily detained. This morning, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. It is reported that the green gas gun does not require bullets and only uses liquid to fire. The large ones have a longer range and greater power. Once the other party smells the gas, they will immediately fall into a coma and sleep forever, unable to be rescued. The medium and small ones can also cause people to faint after smelling the gas, but they can wake up after six hours without any danger to their lives.</p>
<h3>Noulens Case Summons Six Witnesses in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Only Huang Wen Arrived</p>
<p>The Whereabouts of the Other Five are Unknown</p>
<p>The Noulens couple's case of endangering the Republic of China has been tried once by Li Mian, the criminal court president of the Jiangsu High Court, at the Jiangning Local Court. Currently, due to the various problems of the Noulens couple's hunger strike in Beijing, the request to transfer jurisdiction, and the request for bail for medical treatment, the second trial period has not yet been set by Judge Li. However, most of the witnesses in the case are in Shanghai. It is believed that six men and women, including Fei Jinshan, Zhao Yangshi, Ding Zhenxun, Zheng Bojin, Huang Wen, and Pan A'da, need to be summoned for questioning. Therefore, the Jiangsu High Court asked the Second Branch of the High Court in the First Special District to assist in summoning them by name. The Second Branch of the High Court issued summonses to the General Patrol Room based on the addresses of the witnesses listed in the documents, ordering them to be notified as soon as possible. However, more than a year has passed since the Noulens couple were arrested. Only Huang Wen still lives at the original address. The others have scattered and their whereabouts are unknown. Therefore, only Huang Wen complied with the summons yesterday morning and went to the Second Branch of the High Court, stating that he was from Guangdong, 53 years old, and the manager of the Xinghua Company. Judge Yu informed him of the reason for the summons from the Jiangsu High Court to testify in Beijing, saying that if he had to go by the deadline, otherwise he would be punished. Huang replied obediently and left. As for the five witnesses, including Fei Jinshan, who could not be found, the Patrol Room lawyer Li Zhishan went to court and stated that the Patrol Room would prepare a written report and submit it to the court so that the court could reply according to the situation. Judge Yu considered this method appropriate and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Tragic Cry for Help in the Dark Night</h3>
<p>A Female Corpse Discovered in the River</p>
<p>A Man Lying on the Bank</p>
<p>Wife's Infidelity Leads to Husband's Murder</p>
<p>Janitors and others at Jiangwan Central School were enjoying the cool air in the school the night before last, when they suddenly heard a sharp and tragic cry for help at around 10:00 pm, suspecting it was a robbery. They immediately sounded the alarm. The Fifth Precinct of the Fifth District heard the chaotic alarm and suspected that there was an extraordinary incident. They ordered the patrol leaders to search the surrounding area. They discovered a female corpse in the small river east of the school and a man lying on the ground on the bank. They immediately arrested him and took him to the station for interrogation. The man confessed that his name was Zhang Shouan and he lived in Hujia Muqiao. The deceased was his wife, Zhang Sunshi, 23 years old. Because of her infidelity, he brought her to this place, murdered her, and pushed her into the river. He heard the alarm and lay in the dark to escape, but he was seen by the flashlight. The police station detained Zhang and ordered the Baoshao to report the case to the local court yesterday. Prosecutor Yang An and Inspector Shen and others were commissioned to the scene and found that the deceased was wearing a white cotton short shirt and black gauze pants. There was dirty cloth on her lower body. Her neck and throat were broken, and there were several nail marks. It was determined that the murderer strangled her to death by breaking her throat. It is thought that the cry for help at that time was from the deceased begging for help and was the time when the murder was committed. The Baoshao was ordered to collect the body on behalf of the government, and the police station was ordered to send the case to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Male and Female Corpses Embracing Each Other Discovered in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Both Men and Women are from the Upper Class</p>
<p>There is a Name on the Flower Handkerchief</p>
<p>Apparently Sacrificed Due to Unrequited Love</p>
<p>The Water Patrol Room recovered a male and female youth corpses from Floating Buoy No. 16 the day before yesterday. The two corpses were tightly held together, and there was a trouser belt between them. The two corpses were tied together by this trouser belt, apparently a love suicide due to unrequited love. The detective Huang Songsheng was ordered to take them to the Putan of the Rescue Bureau at the South Wharf and report to the local court. Prosecutor Yang Qi and others identified the bodies as drowning and ordered them to be collected. The male corpse was in his twenties, wearing a white silk short shirt and pants. The female corpse was about twenty years old, wearing a white silk gown, both dressed in upper-class fashion. There was a flower handkerchief in the corpse bag with the words "Dear Brother Chengxun, Best Wishes, Sister Juying." It is presumed that the man was Chengxun and the woman was Juying, and the tragic death of love has become clear.</p>
<h3>Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Proposes to Use Chinese for Insurance Policies and Articles of Association</h3>
<p>Municipal Federation Sends a Telegram to the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation believes that the policies and articles of association of the Chinese-owned insurance industry in this city are all printed in foreign languages, which is an insult to the national system. Yesterday, it specially issued a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and the Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting the change to Chinese. The original text is as follows: Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs in Shanghai, Chairman Wang of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, according to the proposal of Committee Member Yu Zhongxian of the 24th Branch of the Federation, the policies and articles of association issued by Chinese-owned insurance companies should be printed in Chinese, which not only preserves the national essence but also makes it easier to identify. However, the insurance companies have not done this, but still follow the accumulated practice of printing in English, which is an insult to national sovereignty and should be corrected to use Chinese. The case has been discussed and a letter has been sent to your office requesting that it be forwarded to the Chinese-owned Insurance Industry Association for investigation and change to Chinese articles of association. It is recorded in the case that it should be vigorously advocated.</p>
<h3>National Government Flood Relief Committee Adds Funds for Anhui Province Agricultural Relief</h3>
<p>Additional Allocation of 1,800 Tons of Relief Wheat</p>
<p>The National Government Flood Relief Committee previously allocated 15,000 tons of relief wheat, entrusting the China International Famine Relief Commission to handle agricultural relief in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, providing low-interest loans to disaster-stricken farmers to restore agricultural production. All administrative expenses were to be raised by the China International Famine Relief Commission itself. The Commission established a general office for Anhui and Jiangxi agricultural relief in Anqing, with branch offices in Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, Nanchang, and Jiujiang for investigation and management. This was carried out with utmost diligence, and farmers in more than thirty disaster-stricken counties were deeply grateful, praising the two organizations incessantly. Except for the Bengbu branch, all other branches have completed the loan distribution. Further steps are being taken to organize cooperatives. The National Government Flood Relief Committee, recognizing the extreme hardship of disaster victims in counties of northern and southern Anhui that have not received agricultural relief, recently allocated an additional 1,800 tons of relief wheat, again entrusting the China International Famine Relief Commission to handle this agricultural relief. It is reported that the China International Famine Relief Commission has informed its Anhui office in Anqing to prepare for implementation as usual. The Commission has published reports of its relief efforts for the Xinren water disasters.</p>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission has published successively this year "Reports on Relief Efforts for the Xinhai and Renzi Water Disasters," "Explanation of Agricultural Relief," "What are Rural Cooperatives," and "Cooperative News Supplements." Interested readers may contact the Shanghai office of the China International Famine Relief Commission at 23 Yuanmingyuan Road to request copies, which will be provided free of charge.</p>
<h3>Creditors of Riyue Bank Oppose Immediate Auction of Huang Chu Jiu's Assets</h3>
<p>Regarding the bankruptcy of the Shanghai Riyue Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department, the Second Special District Court has scheduled a general auction of all movable and immovable property of Huang Chu Jiu to repay debts and expedite the closure of the case, as previously reported. Lawyers Wang Shizong, Dong Yu, Dong Chi, Chen Zhigao, Bian Jialu, Qin Zemin, Xu Yannian, and Chen Tingrui, representing several thousand creditors, unanimously opposed the immediate auction. They jointly submitted petitions to the execution division of the Second Special District Court yesterday morning, stating to Judge Cao that they were pleased to learn from the newspapers of the 7th of this month that the court had ruled to implement the auction of Huang's assets. However, they noted that the court had held several hearings before the deadline, and the petitioners had not been summoned. Only Yan Luqing, a lawyer representing a portion of the creditors, had appeared in court to present arguments and make requests, which could hardly represent the intentions of all creditors. Furthermore, most of Huang's real estate is subject to mortgages. It is uncertain whether the auction proceeds, after deducting the mortgage debts, will yield a surplus or be insufficient to cover the mortgaged debts. Moreover, it is questionable whether the current disposition of properties built on leased land will secure favorable returns. All these matters are closely related to the interests of the creditors. Since the creditors and their representatives were not given the opportunity to consider the disposal methods before the fact, nor was their consent obtained afterward, in order to protect the creditors' interests from losses, they requested that the court summon all creditor representatives to present their opinions before disposing of Huang's assets, so as to safeguard the interests of the creditors. Judge Cao announced that he would summon them within the shortest possible time and ordered accountants Pan and Wu to submit detailed written reports for review, before adjourning the hearing.</p>
<h3>Submissions to the Municipal Government from Various Branches of the Citizens' Federation</h3>
<p>Similar Commercial Losses in the Central District</p>
<p>Request for Fair Treatment in Rent Exemption Standards</p>
<p>The 26th, 11th, 8th, 18th, and 24th district branches of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, noting that the municipal government's recent promulgation of rent exemption announcements has overlooked the area south of the Suzhou Creek (Central District), failing to consider the suffering of businesses due to the strike, deemed it unfair. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a petition to the municipal government stating: "We petition to request consideration of the overall situation of the city, insight into the difficulties of businesses, and the promulgation of rent exemption measures for the area south of the Suzhou Creek (Central District) as well, to show that relief is universally applied and that fairness and facts are emphasized. When the January 28th incident occurred, the city unanimously went on strike to resist aggression for more than two months. The commercial losses are incalculable. Since the painful resumption of business on April 1st, the postwar commercial decline threatens bankruptcy. Therefore, an atmosphere of rent exemption pervades the entire city, hoping for its implementation to provide adjustment. Demands for promulgation are eagerly awaited. Unexpectedly, the announcement of rent exemption has greatly disappointed the people. The so-called weighing of the situation, deliberation of principles, and broad collection of public opinion are mere formalities. The Central District, which was equally affected by the war and suffered similar losses due to the strike, has been excluded from rent exemption, discriminating against public opinion and disregarding the people's livelihood. The public is bewildered by this. If prompt measures are not taken, it will be impossible to uphold public opinion and emphasize principles. The association, recognizing the difficulties of the commercial market and to prevent the proliferation of disputes, requests a two-month rent exemption to demonstrate fairness. We respectfully submit this document requesting review and approval for implementation, for the public good."</p>

<h3>News of Rent Reduction Dispute in Fuxing Lane, French Concession</h3>
<p>Various organizations and tenants in the French Concession are paying close attention to the rent dispute in Fuxing Lane. In addition to sending a letter to the court requesting a fair trial, all tenants in the lane continued to hold an emergency general meeting at a tea garden in the city's Chenghuang Temple at 2:00 PM yesterday, with more than thirty people attending. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by proposals from various tenant representatives: (1) The Third Tribunal of the Second Special District Court will continue the trial next Wednesday at 9:00 AM. Although only the Fuli Tai Beef Shop is suing, the case affects everyone, so everyone should attend the trial. Also, send letters to various organizations requesting them to send representatives to attend and observe. (2) All tenants have evidence that the landlord collected rental deposits. Each tenant has verified the ticket stubs with the Qianzhuang banks and will not recognize the landlord's changed rent terms. It is illegal to extort rent. Legal advisors Li Ming and Chen Chou will be asked to file a criminal lawsuit with the court. (3) Regarding the landlord's lawsuit for rent arrears, each tenant has a large deposit, which, according to the amount claimed, is more than sufficient. Furthermore, since May, each tenant has deposited the rent into the bank, so there is no reason for the claim in fact. The court should dismiss it and file a counterclaim. (4) Issue a declaration exposing the landlord's unreasonable oppression and profiteering by subletting and extorting rent, hoping to gain sympathy from all sectors of society. (5) In the name of the Tenant Federation, send letters to the Municipal Rent Reduction Movement Committee, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Concession, the Citizens' Federation, and the various Road Business Federations to uphold justice and provide assistance. Declare that if the rent reduction requirement is not met due to complete evidence and reasonable demands, it will inevitably affect the city's rent reduction movement. (6) If necessary, the tenant association will petition the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Council for Adjudicating Rent Disputes. (7) In the name of the Tenant Federation, schedule a dinner to invite representatives from various organizations, agencies, and Chinese consulates to report the true facts of the lane to facilitate external understanding. (8) Appoint three representatives in advance to report everything to the Rent Reduction Committee of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession and the volunteer legal team. (9) Each tenant has thoroughly investigated the landlord's subletting and building costs and the fact that they are making large profits and has made a form, which will be sent to lawyers Li and Chen today for submission to the court for reference. (10) The reason why each tenant is participating in the rent reduction request is that they are affected by the expensive deposits, their businesses are not improving, they have suffered losses due to the war, and every family is finding it difficult to support themselves. If the goal cannot be achieved, then when necessary, they will all give up their leases to the landlord. There are already several businesses in the lane who have expressed their determination to give up their leases before the problem is resolved, such as the Yuedong Inn in the lane, whose business is poor, with a maximum of five or six yuan of business per day, which is not enough to cover daily expenses, let alone maintain the business in the past. Therefore, all middle- and upper-class inns in the French Concession are being liquidated and closed. This suffering is due to the influence of high rents. The other shops in the lane are also suffering the same pain, but the landlord does not show compassion and is oppressing each tenant, so they must fight to the end. All of the above proposals were approved by the crowd and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Two Recent Rescue Efforts by the Municipal Ferry</h3>
<p>One Russian woman... one Frenchman</p>
<p>Last Saturday (the 16th) at 1:00 PM, the Municipal Ferry No. 1 departed from the Bund of Nanjing Road. When it reached the vicinity of the Jianghai Customs gunpowder depot, a Russian woman suddenly jumped into the river from the stern of the ship, attempting suicide. Deputy Director Cao of the Municipal Ferry Administration happened to be on board and, upon seeing this, immediately threw four lifebuoys. He also ordered the ferry to reverse and circle back. Eventually, the sailors helped to rescue the Russian woman, gave her clothes to change into. He asked her the reason for the suicide, but she remained silent, with a look of sorrow on her face, revealing a kind of grief. Later, the woman waited for the ferry to dock and borrowed one yuan from the ship's staff before leaving.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (Sunday) at 3:00 PM, a Frenchman, accompanied by friends and family, took the municipal ferry to the Gaoqiao seaside bathing beach. He did not swim, but sat on the beach, drinking a lot of alcohol. Suddenly, he fainted, and his limbs became rigid. A ferry staff member spotted this and immediately took out his own wire bed, helped him lie down, and the staff members, along with his family, tried their best to rescue him and took him to the hospital and found a doctor to treat him. However, he had already stopped breathing. The Municipal Ferry Administration then specially opened a boat to send him back to Shanghai. According to his family, the Frenchman had been ill for many days with a high fever. He was forced to come here by his friend's insistence. They expressed deep gratitude to the Municipal Ferry staff for their assistance.</p>
<h3>Collision between Inland Ships in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Fortunately, No Major Damage</p>
<p>The Yih Ho &amp; Co's Shanghai-Yixing ship Jiang He, which arrived in Shanghai from Hankou on the 16th, was docked at the No. 22 river buoy near Tilanqiao. At 4:00 PM on the 17th, it changed to the No. 2 river buoy, untied the cable, and drove south. Near the river buoy, it was driving slowly to tie the cable. Unexpectedly, it was pushed by the rapid current, and the hull leaned toward Pudong. The Italian warship Esperia, which was moored there, saw the Jiang He colliding and was unable to move, so the Jiang He grazed it on the starboard side. Fortunately, the Jiang He was a small ship, and neither ship sustained major damage. The water patrol police dispatched a boat to the scene to investigate. The Jiang He itself was damaged by the collision, but the crew was unharmed.</p>
<h3>Reactionary Elements Rotated for Preliminary Hearing</h3>
<p>At the Gonghe Grand Theater on the corner of Caobao Road, Roberts Road, and Jiaozhou Road in West Shanghai, a group of reactionary elements gathered on the morning of the previous day under the pretext of raising funds to aid the Northeast Volunteer Army by staging a play. They convened a secret meeting of representatives of the Anti-Imperialist League of Jiangsu Province, distributed reactionary leaflets. Zhu Mingqin, the sixth district chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, dispatched patrol officers and police officers from the second battalion of the police force, along with Chinese and Western detectives from the Concession Police, and detained more than ninety people in the field, along with reactionary publications. They were transported in three trucks and presented to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that Wu Zhiquan, chief of the third section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, dispatched Ding Shibai, director of the interrogation section, along with four section staff members, to conduct preliminary interrogations in rotation. It is said that the case is serious and cannot be disclosed. After the preliminary hearing procedures are completed, the prisoners and their statements will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiqing's Secretary Su Youxi Seriously Injured and Dies in Car Accident</h3>
<p>Automobile Driver Zheng Yuqiu Also in Life-Threatening Condition</p>
<p>Zhu Jiqing, a member of the Central Committee, was travelling from Shanghai to Beijing and then to the Northeast. Because there were still unfinished matters in Shanghai, he left his private secretary, Su Youxi, in Shanghai to take care of everything. Yesterday morning at 9:35, Su was riding in a black Zhao Hui No. 726 car on official business. When the car drove to the front of the Wanguo Cemetery on Jing'an Temple Road, a trolley car from the first route of the British Concession was coming from the east.

<h3>Suspicious Behavior of Concubine Leads to Assault During a Quarrel Over Cooling Off</h3>
<p>Violently Attacked with Six Knives, Severely Injured</p>
<p>Wang Qian, a woman from Shaoxing, is 27 years old. She had a relationship with Wang Yanshan, also from Shaoxing, for seven years and lived together at 1990 Peng Road. In May of last year, she suddenly ran away. Wang found her on Tangshan Road. After that, Wang became suspicious of his concubine's runaway behavior and tightened his control, forbidding her from going out. At around 10:00 PM on the night before last, she wanted to go out to cool off because the weather was hot, but Wang did not allow it. At 10:45, she sneaked out. Shortly after, she came back after cooling off. Wang scolded her, and she argued back, which led to a quarrel. Wang took a kitchen knife and suddenly went forward and attacked her violently with six knives, causing her to sustain five injuries to her left leg and one injury to her left hand. Blood gushed out, and she fell to the ground, shouting for help. The second landlord, Lu Yonglin, reported it to the Huishi Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detective Tang Guangfu and notified the fire brigade to send a fire truck. Wang was arrested with the knife and taken to the police station, and the injured Wang Qian was taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the previous situation, saying that the victim Wang Qian was seriously injured and was receiving treatment in the hospital, so she could not come to court. He requested a postponement of the interrogation and presented the murder weapon. Then, the witness Lu Wang, a woman, testified that at around 10:00 PM last night, she suddenly heard screams for help upstairs. She hurried upstairs and saw the defendant still holding a kitchen knife, while Wang Qian was lying on the ground. After Ge Sixun checked the confession, he questioned the defendant Wang Yanshan and ordered him to be detained for another seven days for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Wang Yousheng Suddenly Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Government Accuses Him of Falsely Accusing Farmers of Colluding with Bandits</p>
<p>Result: Released on Bail of 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Wang Yousheng (aka Wang Liuquan), a 55-year-old native of Shangyu County, Zhejiang, is a businessman in Shanghai with modest assets. He lives at No. 12, Lane 366, Bubbling Well Road, French Concession. The other day, lawyer Gu Changyuan, holding an arrest warrant from the First Special Court, went to the Xinzha Police Station to request the police to arrest Wang Yousheng. The reason for the arrest was that Wang had falsely accused farmers Chen Shijing and others of colluding with bandits in Zhejiang Province in February of last year. The chief then sent Chinese detective Su Yinggen to the French Police Station to cooperate with French detectives in arresting Wang. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Chen Shijing hired Gu Changyuan and Tao Wuzhi as lawyers to appear in court. Wang Yousheng hired Fan Gang, Yu Chengxiu, and Tan Xinwan as lawyers to defend him. First, police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the defendant was suspected of making false accusations, so the Zhejiang Provincial Government requested the court to arrest him and requested permission to transfer him. However, the Zhejiang Provincial Government is not a modern court, so according to the agreement, the plaintiff should submit sufficient evidence. Until the evidence is proven, the police station is unwilling to transfer the defendant. Moreover, the Zhejiang Provincial Government did not send anyone to court today to make the request, so he requested a postponement of the interrogation. Then, lawyer Gu stated that the defendant was not only suspected of making false accusations in Zhejiang Province, but also of illegally establishing public cases and forcibly occupying sand fields. As the lawyer was about to speak at length, the defendant's lawyer immediately stood up and objected, saying that lawyer Gu had not submitted a power of attorney today and had no right to speak. He should be prohibited from speaking. Moreover, the Zhejiang Provincial Government is the highest-level administrative organ in Zhejiang Province and is not a judicial authority, so the Zhejiang Provincial Government has absolutely no right to hear this case. The points mentioned by lawyer Gu just now were similar to those of local tyrants. The regulations for punishing local tyrants have been explicitly abolished. According to the agreement, sufficient evidence must be submitted for proof. Since he has not submitted any, he should be released, or allowed to post bail to be available at any time. Because the defendant has lived in the concession for many years and is a legitimate merchant, there is no risk of him fleeing. After Judge Ge Sixun checked the report, he stated that this case was requested by the Zhejiang Provincial Government for assistance. Since the Zhejiang Provincial Government did not send any official documents, the case could not be clearly understood. He then ordered the defendant to post bail of 10,000 yuan in cash or by guarantor, pending the arrival of official documents from the Zhejiang Provincial Government for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Chongming Bandit Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Cao Aqing, a notorious bandit involved in the robbery of Zhang Sanjiang and other families in the Fifth District of Chongming County, has been wanted by the water and land police departments for a long time, but has not been apprehended. Recently, Mao Xiaoshan, a detective from the 17th team of the Fourth District of the Waterborne Public Security Team of Jiangsu Province, learned that the bandit was hiding on a coal boat outside the Taitong Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong. He secretly reported it to Team Leader Gong, who prepared official documents and came to Shanghai yesterday morning to request the Third District of the Public Security Bureau to send police to assist in the arrest. The bandit was leaving the Longquan Tea House and was identified correctly by the informant. He was arrested on the spot and taken to the district. After Director Yu briefly interrogated him, the bandit confessed that he was 35 years old, a native of Chongming, and had no fixed address. He was ordered to be sent to the General Bureau for interrogation first and then the detective was instructed to take him back to the bureau for trial.</p>
<h3>Father-in-Law and Son-in-Law in Violent Incident Over Unpaid Rent</h3>
<p>He Jinyu, a carpenter from Yangzhou living at No. 30 Qijiabang, Jingzhou Road, lived with his father-in-law, Gu Yongchang, from Jiangbei. At 9:00 PM the night before last, Gu demanded four months of rent, totaling 14 yuan, but He refused to pay, causing a dispute. He went to his friend Zhou's place at No. 43 Baocheng Lane and obtained a chisel, with which he stabbed Gu in the left arm and punched him to the ground. Gu's son, Zhenrong, saw this and was shocked. When he went forward to dissuade them, he was also stabbed in the arm, chest, back, and other parts, injured and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. He saw that he had caused a big disaster and took the opportunity to escape. After the police were informed, they immediately ordered Chinese detective Ma Wenda to investigate and sent the two injured to the Sacred Heart Hospital. Gu Yongchang's injuries were relatively minor. After the doctor bandaged him, he was discharged. When the murderer He Jinyu was arrested by the detective at No. 43 Baocheng Lane, he tried to escape and jumped out of the window on the second floor, injuring his leg. He was taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The police station lawyer stated that the victim Gu Zhenrong was seriously injured and could not attend the court. He requested a postponement. Gu Yongchang complained that the defendant was his son-in-law and lived in his house, owing four months' rent without paying a penny. When he asked for it, he dared to commit violence. His son Zhenrong tried to dissuade them and was also stabbed. He requested an investigation. His daughter He Gu stated that she had been married to the defendant for three years and had not yet had children. At that time, it was over the unpaid rent, and the defendant insulted and scolded her father, causing him to be slightly hit in the face. He went out to get a chisel and came home and stabbed her father. She did not witness it, however. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he had owed rent for four months, but there was a war in Shanghai, so he should be given three months' rent exemption. His wife had paid four yuan. At that time, his parents-in-law, his wife, and his brother beat him together. Unable to resist, he used a chisel to resist, etc. After Judge Shen Bingrong checked the confession, he ordered him to be returned to custody, pending the recovery of the victim for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Laborer Drowns While Taking a Cold Bath</h3>
<p>Lu Fulin, a 26-year-old native of Haimen, worked as a laborer for the Shanghai Moving Company. The day before yesterday afternoon, he went to the Suzhou Creek, south of Henan Road, to take a cold bath alone. He accidentally slipped and fell into the river, causing him to drown. His body sank to the bottom of the river. After Lu's wife, Wang, found out, she sent people to dredge for him. At 7:00 PM, the body was recovered near the silk merchants' wharf. That night, a coffin was prepared to take in the remains.</p>
<h3>Yong An Tang's Hu Guigeng's Banquet for the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>With Sincere Remarks During the Gathering</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Guigeng of Tiger Balm Yong An Tang hosted a banquet for reporters from various newspapers at Xing Hua Lou on Fourth Malu last night. A large number of reporters attended and were warmly welcomed by Mr. Hu. After several rounds of drinks, Mr. Hu stood up and delivered a speech, saying, "I, on behalf of Mr. Hu Wenhu, the owner of Yong An Tang, have prepared this simple feast tonight to celebrate with the leaders of the press. I am honored and grateful for your presence. This banquet has three meanings, which I would like to share with you all. (1) The significant relationship between the press and society and the nation is well understood by the world and needs no further explanation from me. I have a great interest in this field. I have lived in Southeast Asia for more than ten years, and most of my time has been spent in newspaper offices. However, I am of mediocre talent and have achieved nothing. Only this interest has not diminished. Shanghai is the center of the nation's economy and culture, and Shanghai's newspapers are the center of national public opinion. You are all erudite and experienced, and you are the driving force behind this center of public opinion. Although I have only been in Shanghai for a month, I have always wanted to learn from you. Tonight, in the spirit of friendship over drinks, I take this opportunity to meet with the leaders of the press, who shape the national public opinion, to witness your elegance and hear your insightful views. It is truly a pleasure. (2) Mr. Hu Wenhu, the owner of our company, although raised in Southeast Asia, loves his motherland no less than others. He has always been the first to donate to various disasters in the country, such as floods and droughts. The Central Women and Children's Hospital in Nanjing was also built with his sole investment of over 370,000 yuan. He pays special attention to and respects the press and journalists. He has established the Burmese Morning Post in Yangon, the Star Daily in Singapore, and the Star Hua Daily in Shantou. Last year, he returned to China and planned to establish newspapers in Shanghai, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and other places to serve as tools for communication between China and Southeast Asia and to encourage overseas Chinese to invest in China. Due to the turbulent times and the temporary lack of talent for running newspapers, he had to start with a trial in Shantou. His ambition has not diminished. During my return to China this time, Mr. Hu repeatedly instructed me to pay close attention to and engage with the press and its leaders in Shanghai in my spare time to learn from them for improving the newspapers in Singapore and other places. Mr. Hu is also eager for overseas Chinese to invest in the motherland, so he also hopes that I can report to you on the recent situation of overseas Chinese to encourage them, guide them, and support them in returning to China to start businesses. (3) Now, from the perspective of overseas Chinese, I would like to report to you on the situation of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Since the global economic crisis became serious, Southeast Asian businesses have also suffered a major blow. The unemployed are feeling the pain of displacement and lack of food and clothing, while the wealthy are also facing crossroads and difficulties in advancing and retreating. Staying means lamenting the lack of investment opportunities, while returning to China means feeling isolated. Their distress and crisis are truly unknown to outsiders. You are the guides of society, and I sincerely hope that in addition to writing about national affairs and criticizing political gains and losses, you will also pay attention to these pitiful overseas Chinese, encourage them to invest in China, guide them on investment paths, and awaken the sympathy and support of the people of the country. I urge the government to provide them with effective protection, which is within your authority and responsibility." After Mr. Hu's speech, the guests exchanged toasts and enjoyed the banquet until around 9 o'clock, when the guests and host parted happily.</p>

<h3>Ship Industry Organizes Special Committee for Unified Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The matter of unified weights and measures has long been ordered by the municipal government to be implemented uniformly throughout the city.

<h3>Wang Letang Takes Office Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Publication of New Life Elementary School Textbooks</h3>
<p>In order to promote education and cultivate national talents, Datong Bookstore is actively editing New Life Elementary School textbooks while successively publishing middle school textbooks. However, this matter is of great importance and progress is quite difficult. No aspect of writing, compilation, proofreading, or printing can be taken lightly. After a year of effort and struggle, fortunately, each book can be published successively before the autumn school opening, including five types: Chinese, arithmetic, social studies, nature, and art. The editors are all members of the curriculum development committee, and are editing according to the latest curriculum standards. The materials used are purely centered on the actual lives of children, and focus on adapting to new environments. The method of writing teaching practices is also different from the usual teaching books. Although teachers have different experiences and children have different abilities, they can feel the natural interest of teaching activities by using the various methods described in the teaching practices. It is truly a complete set of elementary school textbooks before the new curriculum standards are promulgated, and stands at the forefront of the times, worthy of being called "New Life."</p>
<h3>Machine-Made Felt Hat Factories Prevent Inferior Goods from Being Mixed In and Passing Off</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Felt Hat Industry Association and its members, machine-made felt hat manufacturers throughout the city, are aware that recently there have been unscrupulous merchants who, for petty profits, either falsely use the names of foreign merchants, mix and sell inferior felt hats, or alter imported inferior felt hats by adding trademarks and brand names to pass them off as domestic goods, confusing the genuine with the fake. This not only destroys commercial ethics, but also affects the future of domestic goods. Therefore, sixteen felt hat manufacturers have carefully devised prevention measures, publishing the trademarks and brand names of the sixteen companies in newspapers, and submitting them to Party and government agencies and various organizations for verification and filing. In the future, if any mixing occurs, once discovered, they will be investigated according to the law.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the news item in yesterday's newspaper about the temporary closure of the San You Society's retail department, it was stated that "the factory notified the power company to remove the current meter," which is not in accordance with the facts. It was found that the power company received a notification from the factory that day to go and remove important components of the power generating motor, which caused panic among all the workers and led to them automatically going to the company to petition. Also, when the petition was made on the 16th, because the workers were mostly orderly, the retail department did not close its iron doors. We hereby request a correction. Thank you for your attention. Sincerely, Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Textile Workers Union, July 18.</p>

<h3>A Fair Discussion on the Issue of Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan Currency by Wu Jingxiong</h3>
<p>The proposal to abolish taels and change to yuan currency has been advocated for a long time. When the National Currency Regulations were promulgated in the third year of the Republic of China, the government had the determination to unify the currency system. Subsequently, through the suggestions of the financial community and the advocacy of well-known scholars, more than ten years have passed. The reason for the delay in achieving this can be stated as follows: (1) Politics have not been brought on track. Abolishing taels and changing to yuan currency is not simply an economic issue. The political components it contains are even greater. Because politics cannot be brought on track, provinces govern themselves, and the central government has no power to refute them. Once taels are abolished and changed to yuan currency, it will create an opportunity for the provinces to seek profits. This is one reason. The power of judgment has not been recovered. Foreign banks use unequal treaties as shields, issuing paper money and absorbing deposits in various ports of our country. Once implemented, it will be like frightening birds in the forest. This is the second reason. There is no large-scale mint that can use accurate fineness to supply sufficient new coins to meet the needs of the whole country, while also giving people the opportunity to freely mint. This is the third reason. Domestic banks are numerous and paper money is rampant. Once taels are abolished and changed to yuan currency, the circulation of paper money will inevitably become wider. If there is a disturbance, the mistakes of the Pinghan Railway in the past are worrisome. Before the political situation is stable and the issuance system is comprehensively reorganized, once implemented, counterfeit currencies will emerge in large numbers. This is the fourth reason. Other details are too numerous to mention. In recent years, only the Shanghai Mint has been built on the banks of the Suzhou River, with a large scale, capable of minting one million yuan day and night. If the fineness can be unified and the management is strict, then the third point can be avoided. This is the only achievement of advocating abolishing taels and changing to yuan currency for more than ten years. What is the progress of the other three points compared to the past? Have the obstacles that hindered progress in the past been completely removed? This is what we should carefully consider before implementing the abolition of taels and changing to yuan currency.</p>
<p>The harm of using both taels and yuan is known to everyone and can be spoken of by everyone. The benefits of abolishing taels and changing to yuan currency, and the urgency of abolishing taels and changing to yuan currency, are also known to everyone and can be spoken of by everyone. What need is there to repeat them? What I want to say now is, in the current environment, even if the abolition of taels and changing to yuan currency is achieved as desired, will the benefits obtained outweigh the harm suffered? Forcing seedlings to grow is what people of the past warned against. Can what we are doing now avoid the criticism of forcing seedlings to grow? I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will calmly discuss it. Don't those who advocate abolishing taels and changing to yuan currency immediately say that the price of customs taels is falling daily and the market is deteriorating daily, and that abolishing taels and changing to yuan currency will revitalize trade and benefit people's livelihood? If so, then Britain, the United States, and Japan are all countries with excellent currency systems. The United States is famous for its wealth in the world, and its gold standard stands firm. Why is the recession also spreading throughout the country? Economic recession has complex causes. As far as our country is concerned, the decline of the rural areas, the plight of the people, the prevalence of natural and man-made disasters, and the entanglement of internal strife and external insults all contribute to it, but they cannot be remedied by abolishing taels and changing to yuan currency. Some say that recently, countries are advocating expanding credit and inflating currency as the only prescription for treating the recession, such as the Bank of England repeatedly reducing interest rates and increasing loans, and powerful parties in the United States strongly advocating minting silver coins and issuing unprepared paper money. The purpose is to inflate the currency so that prices can rise, people's purchasing power can be increased, and production and sales can be matched, and then the economy can gradually return to its original state. Now, if our country abolishes taels and changes to yuan currency, the circulation of silver yuan will become wider and the issuance of paper money will become more. Chips will be rampant and currency inflation will lead to the same goal as the economic relief plans of various countries through different routes. The answer is that this is not understanding our country's relief organization. Today, China's position is inversely proportional to that of countries using the gold standard. It does not suffer from overproduction, but from too little. It does not suffer from falling prices, but from rising prices. Due to years of natural and man-made disasters, fields are barren and the price of gold is extremely high. Prices of all goods are soaring. After the January 28 Incident, the wounds are all over and vitality is lost. To recuperate, the first priority is to reduce the currency, not to expand the currency, and to lower prices, not to raise prices. Therefore, the economic relief plans of various countries will become a suicidal policy in our country. Those who imitate me die. How can things in the world be easily imitated? Recently, Jiang Jun published an article in Shen Bao (see Shen Bao on July 11 and 12) entitled "What Are We Waiting For to Abolish Taels and Change to Yuan Currency?" He believes that the current concerns about the expansion of paper currency after the abolition of taels and changing to yuan currency are untenable. He cites the issuance amount of various banks in Shanghai and the warehouse receipts as proof, believing that the current issuance preparations for general paper money are sufficient and there is no fear of price drops. Regarding this point, we believe that it should be studied as two questions. Is it necessary to inflate the currency at the moment? Is the result of abolishing taels and changing to yuan currency helping to inflate the currency as a problem? After the currency is inflated, how will the paper money preparation be regulated? Is the current 46 preparation system and the public inspection method of each issuing bank considered perfect and impeccable? Does the government have the power to control national issuance? Can we avoid repeating the mistakes of the Pinghan Railway in the past as another problem? At present, the ready cash in the mainland is useless and is concentrated in the commercial center. Tianjin, Shanghai, Pinghan all feel the pain of excess chips. High prices are caused by this. Therefore, the currency needs to be reduced urgently and should not be inflated, which is an obvious fact. If we rashly abolish taels and change to yuan currency at this time, the mint will inevitably actively mint new coins to comply with the law. At the same time, once silver taels lose their currency effect everywhere, they will inevitably be sent to the mint to be recast into silver yuan. The number of silver yuan will naturally increase day by day, and people will compete for paper money due to the inconvenience of using cash. Therefore, issuing banks (including foreign banks) will inevitably take the opportunity to actively expand the issuance amount to meet the needs, and the inflation of currency will be unstoppable. The unmanageable situation of Feng banknotes and the sudden rise and fall of Guangdong banknotes are obvious to everyone. As for the Pinghan incident in the past, people still change color when talking about it. It was found that the preparations of various banks in Hankou at that time were all handled according to the law, but they were difficult to resist due to environmental forces, and they finally became a situation of suspension of exchange. The severity of the situation at that time cannot be forgotten. If an incident happens again in the future, if we unfortunately repeat the mistakes of the Pinghan Railway, the harm will be a hundred times greater than in the past. Before its number is greater and the area of circulation is wider. Therefore, before the political situation is clear and the issuance power has not been unified, if measures are taken carelessly, it will cause endless disasters to the society. It is unacceptable to give up eating because of choking, but how can it be wise to knowingly commit a crime? It is necessary to consider this carefully.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of the fineness of silver coins, the current types are complex and the fineness varies. Even with the new coins of President Yuan, the fineness is uneven. To abolish taels and change to yuan currency, it is necessary to concentrate minting, strictly stipulate the fineness of new coins, diligently add chemical verification, and properly supervise them. Without making the fineness vary, the credit of the new coins can be established. Give people the opportunity to freely mint, so that the use of new coins can be unimpeded far and wide. Some say that the Shanghai Mint is already doing this well. Why worry about it? I don't know that this requires a strong central government, with orders being carried out, making the provinces and regions submit and dare not hold different opinions. Otherwise, the power to mint coins still cannot be concentrated. Following the example of provinces governing themselves, those who abused the minting of copper coins in the past will go on to abuse the minting of silver yuan and use them in the market. The result is unbearable to say. Our suggestion is made with caution for this reason.</p>
<p>When people discuss abolishing taels and changing to yuan currency, they must criticize silver taels without reservation. Throwing stones at someone who has fallen into a well is a common technique of the Chinese people. I do not want to make a false statement. Think about it. Over the past few decades, there have been many major calamities, and there have been frequent disturbances in the market. However, the panic has finally subsided, and the market has finally avoided collapse. It is not that it has implicitly received the benefit of double preparation under the parallel use of taels and yuan. Because of Chinese and foreign trade, large and small contracts, claims and debts are mostly based on silver taels, although the fineness of silver yuan has been high and low over the years, and there have been ups and downs in paper money, prices have been stabilized a lot invisibly. We see that the result of the provinces' abuse of minting copper coins has led to a sharp drop in the price of copper coins. As a result, the prices of daily necessities valued in copper coins have risen sharply. The poor people whose income is based on copper coins are greatly affected by the difficulty of making a living. Although their income can also be required to increase, the speed of its increase can never be as fast as the rise in prices. Therefore, the pain suffered in a certain period is difficult to describe. Fortunately, most people in society are not affected because their income is in silver yuan, and silver yuan is backed by silver taels. Now, if taels are abolished and changed to yuan currency, the silver taels whose actual value is equal to the face value will disappear. If there are problems with the fineness of silver coins and the preparation of paper money, all kinds of goods valued in silver yuan will inevitably skyrocket in order to make up for the loss. At that time, the commotion caused in the entire society will be unbearable, and the economic organization will collapse and inundate the people in deep water and fire. Therefore, should it not be considered carefully before implementation? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>On School Physical Education (1) by Lu Xiangqian</h3>
<p>It has been several decades since we advocated for new education in our country. What has been the effect? Those with knowledge will have their own fair opinions, and there is no need for me to repeat them. Furthermore, the author is not an expert and has only observed a few things, so I dare not make hasty remarks for fear of being ridiculed by experts. However, for more than ten years, I have seen that the so-called promotion of physical education by the school authorities and the main physical education administrators in general universities and middle schools have made inappropriate arrangements and entered into dangerous detours, which not only harm young people at the time, but also endanger the foundation of the country and ruin the nation. If this continues, the consequences will be unimaginable. Now that the Ministry of Education is about to convene a national sports conference, there will be many reforms in school physical education. I am not talented, but I dare to present my usual observations and what the school authorities and main physical education administrators in general universities and middle schools have done wrong in the past and what urgently needs to be changed in the future, in order to provide some humble opinions before the national expert conference. I hope that any omissions will be corrected.</p>
<p>(1) Lack of Teachers Often Occurs; the Government Should Establish Specialized Schools. Considering the number of schools nationwide, the allocation of physical education teachers, regardless of their quality or quantity, is inadequate. As a result, either the material is not suitable for the job or unqualified people are used to fill the positions, gradually leading to the current incoherent state of physical education. The school authorities do not see this. They only need to find a person with a false reputation and a title to serve as the main physical education administrator of a school. They do not care whether the arrangements are appropriate or whether the promotion is widespread. What they seek is only whether our school can win a certain championship or a certain prize, and they boast to the public that this is the development of physical education in our school, this is the appropriateness of our school's promotion. Alas! The authorities' misunderstanding of physical education is like this, and the physical education administrators' facilities and arrangements are like that. It is appropriate that a young athlete suddenly leaps to become the director of physical education at a university. Football masters and basketball stars can almost all be filled as physical education professors in universities and middle schools. Alas, it is difficult to hope that the promotion of current school physical education can be done in this way. Considering the situation, the problem does not lie with the athletes or general star athletes, but with the government's inability to establish more specialized physical education schools to cultivate talent and distribute them throughout the country. The school authorities' pursuit of false reputations and lack of practical promotion is also an inexcusable thing.</p>
<p>(2) Economic Resources Must Be Appropriately Allocated and Managed. Some school authorities view physical education as a tool to flaunt, while others view it as a burden. The former causes the creation of a special class of school athletes, while the latter fosters a generation of weak and self-admiring young men. Looking at schools across the country, there are many that do not hire physical education teachers, do not make physical education a compulsory subject, and have no sports grounds or physical education equipment. The only excuse given by the authorities is that they are affected by the economy, and they do not consider the relationship between academic work and physical health, or the future of young people and the nation. It is so sad to talk about school education in this way. I hope that in the future, school authorities, no matter what kind of difficult environment they are in, will strive to eliminate this problem, determine the funds for school physical education, promote physical education, cultivate the nation's vitality, and lay a century-long foundation for the country. Then it will be fortunate. However, there are also those who say that it is inappropriate for those who do not contribute a penny to the promotion of physical education, and it is also inappropriate to misuse large sums of money on athletic schools. There are many universities and middle schools that use superficial methods of promotion, collecting annual physical education fees from all students and spending them on a small number of athletes, while neglecting the majority of students. This kind of special training for athletes, using the price paid by the majority of people to benefit a small number of people, is actually a dangerous step in promoting physical education. It is especially important for those in charge of school physical education to reflect and improve on the occurrence of this kind of abuse. If it is said that schools should promote physical education, they should have adequate funding, but the allocation must be equal and appropriate, and it must be consistent with the principle of taking from the public and using it for the public.</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of the World Games (13)</h3>
<p>(12) A Glimpse of the Venue of This Year's Games</p>
<p>Among all the buildings in the Olympic Village, the most outstanding is the Olympic Village itself. It used to be a desolate and shabby area, but now it has become a glorious and magnificent sports village. The main entrance and the general office of the venue are purely Spanish-style buildings, and the surrounding stands and dining halls are designated for each country to avoid mixing.</p>
<p>The Olympic Village is exclusively for athletes and staff from various countries to reside in, and can accommodate two to three thousand people. The village is located west of Los Angeles, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, and is conveniently located between sixteen competition venues and training grounds. The houses in the village have two rooms each, accommodating four people. There is also a management office and a dining hall. The dining hall is about 1,200 feet long and divided into several rooms, so that each country's team can bring their own chefs and prepare their own food and drinks. The construction cost was as high as 500,000 US dollars. As for the female athletes and female coaches, they live in the dormitories of the University of Southern California, which are very close to the venue.</p>
<p>The Olympic Stadium The Olympic Stadium is located in the Olympic Park and includes a track and field stadium, boxing arena, wrestling arena, and art museum. Its construction was planned ten years ago, and it is located near Los Angeles, with extremely convenient transportation. The track and field stadium can accommodate 105,000 people. The track is one mile in circumference and 220 meters straight. There are locker rooms for thousands of people. The construction began in 1921, and it was first opened in 1923, accommodating 80,000 spectators at that time. Three years ago, someone contracted to expand it for one million US dollars.</p>
<p>Swimming Pool The pool is connected to the track and field field. It is 50 meters long and 20 meters wide. One end is 1.5 meters deep and the other end is 5 meters deep. The water is extremely clean. The stands are made of very strong cement and can accommodate 10,000 people. Underneath the stands are locker rooms, bathrooms, offices, etc. The construction cost was as high as 250,000 US dollars.</p>
<p>Fencing Room This is the gymnasium of the California military camp. The building is also very strong, with a high roof and lush wisteria, which is quite spectacular. The floor is 90 meters long and 45 meters wide, suitable for eight fencing competitions. The surrounding area can also accommodate 10,000 spectators, with entertainment rooms, locker rooms, and offices.</p>
<p>Art Museum The art performances are held in the Olympic Stadium, which has nineteen exhibition rooms, adjacent to the fencing arena. The surrounding area is shaded by trees and the flowers are competing for beauty, making it a perfect place for art competitions.</p>
<p>Boxing and Wrestling Boxing, wrestling, and weightlifting are held in the Olympic Stadium, which can accommodate 10,000 spectators. The location is in the center of the Olympic Park.</p>
<p>Velodrome The construction cost was as high as 500,000 US dollars. It is constructed entirely of sturdy wood, forming a sloping, semi-concave shape. It was designed and built by the International Cycling Association and can accommodate 85,000 spectators. The construction cost was 250,000.</p>
<p>Rowing and Sailing The rowing venue is at the Marine McLaines Stadium. In addition to the docks, referees' seats, and offices, there are stands that can accommodate 15,000 people. The river is 2,000 meters long and 130 meters wide. Both banks of the river can accommodate 100,000 spectators. The Los Angeles seashore sailing competition venue can accommodate tens of thousands of spectators. In addition, the polo field and golf field are flat and wide, also serving as part of the Olympic Games venue.</p>

<h3>Blazing Grandiose Words</h3>
<p>Old Man Jiu Gong, Ma Xiangbo</p>
<p>In my life, I have died three or four times (please refer to the immortal four of the old man Xiang in this column on May 22). I remember one time, at the age of four, I had smallpox. Even the small coffin was prepared, and the clothes for going into the coffin were all put on. My father had just returned from outside, and he hugged my body and wept loudly. I don't know how, but I suddenly heard my father's crying, and I suddenly woke up and said with sobs:</p>
<p>"I won't die, I want to make meritorious service before I die!"</p>
<p>At first glance, this sentence seems very despicable, but it is not. When I was young, I wanted to make meritorious service, but I had already realized that one must do something in this world, and there was no dream of getting promoted and making a fortune. This pure and good idea of being superior to others comes from religious upbringing. This religious upbringing was given by a religious family. Because I had a religious family and a religious environment, I heard religious principles every day, and my state of mind was great from a young age, and when I opened my mouth, I couldn't help but speak blazing grandiose words.</p>
<p>People say that religion is foolish. In fact, it may be crazy, but not necessarily foolish. Literati who love to drink must drink to the point of being very drunk, drunk to the point of being in a world of clouds and mist, like being crazy, before good poems can be written. Religious people have firm beliefs, so sincerity can move mountains and open rocks. To others, it seems foolish, but I consider myself crazy.</p>
<p>With a crazy belief, then one can become a religious person! Similarly, with a crazy belief, then one can become a scholar. In the world, I don't know how many scholars have succeeded after going crazy. I have a crazy belief in religion, so I also have a crazy interest in science. It is because of this that I have a special interest in science!</p>
<h3>Records of a Gathering West of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Lu Jingqing</p>
<p>The Xuhui area west of Shanghai is lush with shade, especially suitable for summer scenery. The green fields are secluded and serene, the water and trees are clear and bright. Elegant companions share carriages, bringing wine and musical instruments, a truly delightful and pleasing experience. Li Yunlao from Jiaochuan recently returned from Jinzhou. Zhu Zhang Ziqiao has just returned from Jingyuan. They invited old friends to a gathering at Bai Mei’s residence (in the western suburbs of Xuhui). Xiong Fenghuang, Huang Bao-yi, Li Zushen, Yin Ruli, and other gentlemen also came to join the excursion. Carriages arrived one after another. Old and new friends, like wine stars and literary stars, gathered in high spirits, filling the room with the joy of spring. Their connected hems touching, fortuitously mirroring the mythical voyage to Penglai. Loosening their robes and leaning on the railings, they savored the magnificent scenery. The midday sun cast cool shadows, and the gentle breeze dispelled the heat. Gazing afar at the Brahma Ferry and Hongjing, the verdant beauty resembled a painting. The ancient Longhua Pagoda seemed to stretch its neck to peer at us. The surrounding emerald green hues filled the view like a red gauze window. Soon, the food and wine were abundant, knives and forks clattered, delicacies piled high, and fragrant wine was poured. They discussed profound and refined topics, feeling relaxed and joyful. They contemplated matters of the nation and family, debated ancient and modern times, expressing their pure and untainted thoughts and lofty aspirations. The long night was filled with feasting and merriment. Adding to the atmosphere were blooming branches, enhancing the colors of the wine vessels. Piles of snowy white fruit tasted as sweet as jade nectar. Late cabbages and early chives offered the refreshing flavors of home. Fragrant lychees and sweet apples, mountain delicacies piled high. Purple eggplants and green beans added to the pleasant flavors. Vegetarian duck and gluten were cooked to perfection. The flavors were rich and satisfying, truly delightful. The cook, Yunlao, usually a Buddhist, is known for his skill with vegetarian cuisine. He modestly calls himself old and clumsy, but he is a master of culinary arts (Li's employed a renowned chef). Extravagance is not like He Yun, but precision is like Wei Qiu. Both fragrant and clean, emulating Mao’s heavenly kitchen, carefully crafted and precise, following the family precepts of Bo Lu. Therefore, the guests were loath to leave, with some drinking too much. The dishes and wine on this day were prepared by the vegetarian restaurant "Caigengxiang" at Yunlao's request. The chef, Yang, once received (monthly) poetry-worthy sums from Japanese to work on Sakura Island, gaining fame. Recently returning to his home country, he now helms the kitchen, lauded as a culinary genius. Among the delicacies served were date paste silver ear fungus, "Seven Treasures Ambrosia," emerald green porridge, and fragrant snowy vegetables, which were particularly praised by the guests. Reminiscing on past friendships. Seemed the vegetables combined the best of fish. Who can say that vegetarian food is too simple, or that the flavor of Caigeng is bland?</p>
<p>Master Xiang sat among the guests, personally sharing his draft manuscripts on civil governance for everyone to peruse. People lauded his brilliant and insightful arguments, which he would devote himself to publishing. His fame would spread far and wide. Such literature is of utmost importance. Our cause is not solitary, and our hearts will endure forever. His transcendent ideas will be as popular and well-received as fine cuisine. After drinking a bit, Master Xiang's face was flushed, and he was slightly tipsy. The pink face reflected the snow. He enjoyed discussing metaphysics with a duster, forgetting the passing of time. His wonderful ideas continued to flow, like pearls rolling from his lips. Carried away by the revelry, he inadvertently slipped and fell. The venerable gentleman had lost his balance. Li Yunlao and Zhu Ziqiao had the appearance of brave soldiers. Yunhe and Zhuxia showed elegant demeanor. They wore homegrown straw hats with double tassels hanging down, full of ancient charm. Remembering the bleak state of the country, they were moved to tears of patriotism, perhaps to show their mature and patriotic intentions. Xiong Bingnian has been living a quiet life in Xiangshan in recent years, managing the children's welfare cause. His silver beard was like a lance, indicating his age. Like a cold pool and autumn moon, he had a clear and noble bearing. Since temporarily staying in Shanghai, he has been diligently involved with the Red Swastika Society. At his leisure, he showed his kindness and generosity, unparalleled in the world. As the banquet came to an end, he inscribed the words "Noble and Pure" on a small book of amateur writing and drawings as a gift. Master Zhu also graciously inscribed "Chest Filled with Five Mountains." Although only scraps of paper and broken silk, they are truly precious. When the honored guests departed, they ascended the platform together. Master Xiang, as if awakened from last night’s wine, also came with a cane. They took several photos together, leaving a lasting impression. This served as a memento of the elegant gathering, a sign that ancient pleasures would not be forgotten.</p>
<h3>The Death of Luo Liangong</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Luo Liangong, a famous scholar from Sichuan, passed away in his Shanghai residence a few days ago, much to the regret of those who heard the news. He had a large build and a light mustache, and was energetic in his conversations, speaking in a loud voice. He had the appearance of a long-lived person. Now, he suddenly passed away before reaching eighty, which was unexpected. In his younger years, he served in General Wu Luzhen’s military staff, devising strategies in the tent. The General deeply relied on him. The young General was handsome and charming, and prone to indulgence in pleasure. Luo Liangong strongly advised him against it, without flattering or pleasing his superior. The General also respected and avoided him for his uprightness and integrity, like Yan Ziling and Emperor Guangwu of Han. It could be said that without Luo Liangong, the General could not have achieved his high position, and without the General, Luo Liangong could not have fulfilled his own ideals. In his later years, Luo Liangong enjoyed reading classic texts. What he spoke of often had Zen-like wisdom. He also had an addiction to drinking, with an immense capacity. One day, a friend invited him to drink fifty-year-old aged wine. The aroma was strong and rich. Luo Liangong was overjoyed and drank several large cups. His friend tried to stop him, saying that aged wine should not be drunk in excess, as it could lead to a deep intoxication that is difficult to wake from. He suggested that a small taste would be better. Luo Liangong thought his friend was being stingy and did not listen. He drank several more cups, only stopping when he felt slightly tipsy. After the banquet, he said goodbye and returned home. It was during the dead of winter, and the biting wind assaulted his clothes, making him shiver with cold. He felt dizzy and almost fell. He struggled to keep his balance and hired a car to take him home. He fell ill for three days before recovering. He then believed that his friend's words were not meant to deceive him, and realized the harm of excessive drinking. After abstaining from alcohol for over a month, someone gifted him several bottles of Du's rose wine. He once again drank excessively. Luo Liangong was skilled in calligraphy. His works after drinking were even more inspired. His calligraphy of couplets could often be found in vegetarian restaurants in Shanghai. I knew Luo Liangong and admired his calligraphy. I kept putting off asking him for a piece. Now, I want to ask but it is impossible. It shows that things in this world are often lost due to procrastination, not just in trivial matters like requesting calligraphy. He was deeply devoted to his wife. Last year, his wife passed away from illness. He wept bitterly and became depressed from then on. His health gradually deteriorated. He fell ill this summer and died, likely due to his emotional distress. His funeral was very simple. His children are still young. I sincerely hope that colleagues in the art world can provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Afterword to "The Talking Myna Bird" - Qian Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>A myna bird that can speak anti-Japanese slogans is righteous. This reminds me of a poem about the Qin Jiliao bird in the collection of the Song Dynasty poet Lin Jishan. The note says: "In the south, people raise Qin Jiliao birds that can speak human language. A barbarian chieftain wanted to buy one for 100,000 coins. The owner, claiming poverty, said he would sell it. The Qin Jiliao bird said, 'I am a Han bird. I do not wish to enter barbarian lands.' It then stiffened and died." Today's myna bird can be compared to the Qin Jiliao bird, one after the other. I compose a poem to praise them:</p>
<p>The myna bird shouts anti-Japanese slogans frequently,</p>
<p>Some humans can't even compare.</p>
<p>Forever side-by-side with the Qin Jiliao,</p>
<p>A Han bird will never be a barbarian slave.</p>
<h3>Casual Summer Chat</h3>
<p>— Jixiang</p>
<p>A friend of mine once bought a pebble in Beijing. It was light red in color. At first glance, it looked no different from any other stone. But when placed in water, eight crab legs appeared in the water. The legs seemed to emerge from the stone, like a real crab. But taking it out to look at it again, it was still just a stone. No one could figure out where the leg shadows came from. It was truly strange. My friend also said that someone else got a stone that had a beauty inside, holding a pipa, with graceful manner. It appeared only vaguely. It was truly the work of gods. The value was more than the city's walls.</p>
<p>My family has a carved bamboo cylinder. The diameter is about three inches and the height is five inches. Over ten human figures are carved on it. All are hollowed out. Each person's face, movements, and expressions are vividly portrayed, as if they were alive. I don't know where it came from, but it is also a precious object.</p>
<p>A certain Tongcheng School writer of the late Qing Dynasty liked to judge the merits of contemporary writers with his students. When it came to inferior works, he would always say, "The writing is good, but alas, it's like hearing drums on a high mountain." The students didn't understand what he meant, so they asked. He said, "Hearing drums on a high mountain, the sound is not clear." The students all smiled wryly.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw Mr. Xiong Bing-san's self-written "Niannujiao" lyrics in a certain place, which read: "The setting sun reflects the twin peaks, watching the buildings compete to rise. Thousands of doors and households. Sigh, the people of southeastern China are exhausted. The lake and mountains are still full of songs and dances. Listening far away to the river tide, the Xutao roars, all to sue private enemies. Only the solitary cypress remains upright, its loyal spirit lasting for thousands of years. Remember the ministers of King Goujian, sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, enduring hardship for the whole territory. An unparalleled beauty can help the country, shaming countless men. The enemy's strength is growing. Court disputes have not stopped. I see Jin soldiers crossing again. Where is the soul of the nation? Who will rule this land?" It was written while traveling in West Lake. His concern for the country and his family overflowed in the lyrics.</p>
<h3>Modern Woman</h3>
<p>— Moyi</p>
<p>— Shanghai Portrait Eulogies No. 2 —</p>
<p>I unintentionally obtained a woman’s diary fragment from Yun, who is known as a socialite. Yun wrote these six words on it: “Modern Woman’s Diary.” I don’t understand what Yun meant. I am copying it here so everyone can judge the reasoning:</p>
<p>“I made an appointment with Little Wang yesterday to come to my house at 2 PM today to go see a movie together. Who knew I’d waited until 2:30 and Little Wang still hasn’t arrived. I’m really angry! Little Wang doesn’t have money to pay for me to see a movie. Actually, I could pay for Little Wang too. There’s no need not to come, ah! Hmph, if it weren’t for Little Wang’s pretty face, I’m afraid no one would want this poor kid, right?</p>
<p>“At 2:45, I really couldn’t stand it anymore. I was just about to change clothes to go find Little Wang when Old Chen came, unexpectedly. If a person’s name has ‘Old’ in it, even a blind person would know that person’s appearance must be very old and ugly. But Old Chen has money. In this era, we young women need certain things. Beautiful young men are certainly indispensable, but it’s a pity they’re mostly poor. So, we might as well have one or two rich men with beards, so we can avoid economic panic. That’s what I mean by my attitude toward Little Wang and Old Chen. Now that Old Chen has come, even though I dislike him a little, I can’t treat him coldly. He said he came especially to invite me to go see a movie. I pretended to be very happy and agreed to his request.</p>
<p>“I hid all my stunning new clothes and only wore something unfashionable. I deliberately looked in the dressing mirror again and again. I frowned for a while, then sighed. He urged me to hurry. I said the clothes were too plain and dull, so I wasn’t going. Then he said, ‘Well then, let’s go cut some fabric first.’ Of course, I was extremely happy inside, but my face still maintained a displeased expression. I got into his big Buick car and went to Wing On Company. I picked out expensive fabric and cut more than three hundred dollars’ worth. He was still smiling, and the ash from the cigar in his mouth didn’t fall off. He didn’t care at all.</p>
<p>“At this time, there was a woman with a diamond ring on her finger who was also cutting fabric. I stared greedily at her diamond ring. Old Chen is really clever, really smart. He guessed what I was thinking and said to me with a smile, ‘Man, let’s go buy one too.’ I didn’t say anything, just gave him a very charming smile. We went to the Ulivon Foreign Firm again. I don’t know how many carats this diamond ring was, but anyway, it was very expensive. When Old Chen signed that check for thirteen hundred dollars, his fingers didn’t tremble at all.</p>
<p>“After we finished watching ‘Circus Flower’ at the Cathay Theatre, we went to the Li Dao Restaurant for dinner together. I was afraid that Little Wang was waiting for me at home, so I ate a little and then said I had a headache and wanted to go home to sleep. He took me home in his car. On the way, he put his arm around my waist and wanted to kiss me. As I struggled to refuse, my right hand touched a package of fabric, and the light from the diamond ring on my left hand shone into my eyes. So I didn’t refuse anymore. He bought a kiss for more than sixteen hundred dollars…”</p>
<h3>Talking about Fujian Meat Floss</h3>
<p>— A Jie</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Bi Cheng wrote "A Narrative of the Origin of Meat Floss" in Ziyoutan, saying that meat floss was founded by Ni Hongshun in Taicang. Now, although the Shanghai Concession is vast, the sellers of meat floss still use the old brand of Ni Hongshun, just like the sauce duck and sauce meat of Lao Sanzhen Lu Gaojian. Without this brand, it is not enough to show the high quality of the product. It is also said that the method of making meat floss has a special secret. It is said that snake oil must be used to prevent spoilage and allow it to be stored in containers without removing the air, the same as canned food today. As far as I know, meat floss is produced everywhere, but the best is made in Fuzhou. Today, the most popular meat floss in Shanghai is the Dingri You meat floss from Fuzhou. I have never heard of Ni Hongshun from Taicang being so famous. Fujian meat floss is light, fluffy, and fresh. It melts in your mouth. It is red and oily, and its deliciousness is unmatched. It is a perfect snack with wine. If you eat it with Shaobing, it has a unique flavor. Six or seven years ago, "Sai You Tian," a shop set up by Fujianese people on Route Edward VII, began selling Dingri You meat floss from Fujian. Each jar cost one yuan and two jiao, which was two-tenths higher than the price in Fujian. There are many rich people in Shanghai, who didn’t care about the high price at first. Therefore, the business was booming and there was a shortage of supply. Now, there are many consignment shops everywhere. However, it is not easy to see the real Dingri You product, and the price has also gradually decreased. In fact, the characteristic of Fuzhou meat floss is that it has more pork fat added during the production, which makes it more flavorful and oily. To say that it is made with snake oil to avoid removing the air is a fabrication. Regardless of the difficulty of obtaining snake oil, even if it were available, how could it have preservative properties? It is not credible.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Liusha</p>
<p>Miss! I sincerely advise you, don't keep lamenting the ugliness of your face in the mirror, and don't hate your stupidity. Your ugliness and stupidity, alas, will be your happiness. Miss! Do you know the golden beetle? How free it is to eat dewdrops in the grass! But when people discover that it has a golden shell, it is arrested and played with. This arrest, alas, shows that people love it. Similarly, people who love roses will break them off. Beauty! Love! Forget it.</p>
<p>The difference between a mistress and a maid is that the mistress is a little lazier, and the maid is more diligent. But in this society, laziness is a virtue, and the lazier you are, the more respected you will be.</p>
<p>A small clerk in a certain agency shows off his power to a primary school teacher with such force that he almost crushes the thin man to death. The reason is simply that he receives twenty more dollars of salary each month.</p>
<p>A certain high official of the Legislative Yuan in the current era, wearing a long mandarin jacket past his knees, with several pieces of Han jade around his waist, his demeanor is different from others. One day, he instructed his young attendant: "You can't become an official without smoking opium."</p>
<p>Have a big attitude, don't be too eager to seek things, don't visit before people visit you, without attitude there is no respect, if you're too eager to seek things you won't succeed, visiting before people visit you lowers your status - this is what a teacher taught me about dealing with the world, is it true?</p>
<p>The Ancient Temple Notes will be temporarily suspended for a few days. We hope readers will forgive us.</p>

<h3>Fluctuations in Gold Standard are Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the fluctuations in the gold standard were extremely drastic. The price was constantly rising and falling around 750 taels, with a total market swing of 7.5 taels. Later, it rose more than 4 taels. However, as the silver price suddenly reported a fall the previous night, the opening was high. Subsequently, news came of the United States issuing public bonds to aid finance. Upon hearing this news, the market became fervently bearish and immediately dropped. It fell from 51.80 taels to 44.30 taels. The exchange rate rose and then fell back. In the afternoon, it turned flat. Towards the end, it was within 50 taels, and people were inevitably anxious. In August, Yufeng Yong liquidated 385 bars, while short positions such as Hengxing and Hengyu increased their holdings. The short positions still paid 2-3 taels, with the minimum being 1.90 taels. However, there were still about 10,000 bars that had not been liquidated. The situation of the past day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The high opening was 750 taels. The September futures opened high at 750 taels, up 4.90 taels. The major firms unexpectedly fell by 3/16 to 1/8, and the silver price also fell by a small 1/8. As a result, buyers were active. Yuanmao Yong, Hongkang Yong, Hengxing and others took the lead in making deals, and the price rose from 49.50 taels to 51 taels. Afterwards, Tong Taichang, Hengxing, Hengyu, Yuanda Yongyuan, Taidadecheng and others sold, immediately falling by 3 taels. Almost at the same time, the bonus bank mutual fund made 6875. Citibank also sold 30 yuan in October, reaching 47.70 taels at 9:20. In an instant, the price rose by 4 taels, because Dadecheng, Fushun Shunli, Hengyu Yifeng and others competed to buy. HSBC also bought 75 August US dollars, pushing the price up to 51.80 taels. HSBC's listed prices did not change, and then returned to 49.5 taels, with Tong Taichang and others selling. Subsequently, there was a rise and fall of 1 tael or so. Near 10 o'clock, it increased to 50.5 taels. However, after learning that the United States would issue public bonds to help the market, people's minds were fickle and the price was not supported. It dropped 5-6 taels at a time. However, from 10:15 to 10:45, there was still a gyration of 1 tael or so. Hengxing Yifeng, Yongzhifeng, Yongfutai, Hengyuan, Taifuyu, Qianchangxiang, Daxingyong and others successively sold, with the September US dollar settlement at 30 yuan. Until 11 o'clock, it finally reached 44.30 taels, and then turned flat. It was heard that a certain bank bought 105 current bars, and also 420 bars, at a price of 46 taels, sold by Runchangyu. Moreover, Yuanheng Hengyu and hedging came to buy, so the price was pulled up by 3 taels to 47.40 taels. Hengxing came out again, and at 11:30 it was 45.80 taels. At that time, it rose again by 1 tael, reaching 7.1 taels. When the midday closed at 46.60 taels, it fell again by a small 5-6 qian.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was soft and then hardened. The afternoon market opened softly at 45.80 taels and immediately went upward. Because Zhaofeng Chang, Yuanmao Yong, Hengchang Yong, Daxing Yong and Hengyu all entered, it was heard that speculators also bought in, because the exchange market was easier to improve. The wheat firms initially sold 125 November US dollars, and then absorbed 1875. The Bombay electric entry was 1875 in September, and the silver companies entered 30 yuan in October. Therefore, at 2:30, it was 50 taels. Zhifeng Yong and Hengxing came out, slightly less than 2 taels, but there was no major change. At 3:30, it was 47.5 taels. After entering, Hengyu Yuanheng Dachen Zhifeng Yong entered again, and Zhengjin absorbed 625 US dollars this month, and then immediately increased by 4 taels. At almost 4 o'clock, it was 51.5 taels. Suddenly, Daxingyong Hengxing and others sold, especially the 8125 September US dollars can be settled, and the 0625 British gold can also be in and out, so it was reduced by more than 2 taels again. At 4:20, it was 49.3 taels. When the market closed at 4:30, it was 49.5 taels. Compared with the end of last week, it rose by 4.4 taels, and it also made up to 9 taels, with the goods being pressed by 7 qian. According to the maximum price of the day, 51.8 taels, and the minimum price of 44.3 taels, the difference was 7.5 taels, and the naked price was 9.5 taels.</p>
<p>The quoted price was slightly reduced by 5 taels. The quoted price was still 821 taels, with a discount of 70 taels to 77 taels. At noon, it was 74.5 taels, and in the afternoon it was 75 taels, and then it was 70 taels. The final price was 72 taels, 5 taels less than last Saturday. The ledger showed 50 taels between July and August, and 87 taels in September. The replenishment water was 47 taels before and after the market.</p>
<p>Trading in the field is tense. The over-the-counter trading is still hot and lively, but the sellers seem to see that there are more of them. According to statistics, Yifeng Shunli and Tongchun all entered. Hengxing, Dadecheng, Zhifeng Yong, Yuantai, Hengchang Yong, Yuankangxiang, Futaiheng, Qianchangxiang and Yifeng Yong all exited. Tong Taichang, Hongkang Yong, Hengyu, Fuyu, Fushun and Daxing Yong came out and entered suddenly. In the afternoon market, Zhaofengchang, Hengchang Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Yuanda Yong, Hengyu, Yifeng Yong, Yuanheng and Dadecheng all entered. Daxing Yong, Hongkang Yong, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Zhifeng Yong exited and then entered again. Qianchangxiang and Hengxing all exited. The rest are complicated. On that day, the Dalian help entered more than 400 bars and sold more than 200 bars. The Cantonese help entered more than 700 bars and exited more than 600 bars. The bar quota of each number is about 20,000.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Fluctuated Slightly</h3>
<p>Trading is Unremitting</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the beginning of the week, there was no telegram from the silver market, and all foreign exchange rates in the local market changed. However, the opening was slightly fluctuating. It was slightly higher in the morning and looser later. The afternoon market turned firm. As a result, British gold fell by 0.0625 and US dollars fell by 0.125 compared to last Saturday. The gold market rebounded by more than 4 taels, while the foreign market situation was very complex. As for the day's unremitting trading, the income and expenditure were divergent. It is estimated that 60,000 to 70,000 pounds of British gold were traded, and banks traded with each other. Guangdong's Shengyu Dax had some sales, and the Bombay telegram entered. Also, there were about 700,000 to 800,000 US dollars, and each number had different revenues and expenditures. The US Silver Company went in and out again, and US dollars were used to make US-British exchange in October, which was 3 yuan and 5 jiao and 6 fen. Among the gold dealers, it was mostly hedging. The market situation showed signs of repeated trading. The transactions are recorded below.</p>
<p>British exchange rates on the domestic market only accounted for 0.0625 difference throughout the day. The selling price at the beginning of the morning was approximately 1 shilling and 8 pence, 0.0625 to 1875, the buying price was 125 to 25, and the swap was still 125.

<h3>The Major Commodity Shrank by 0.0625</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 18th: Major commodities fell slightly, closing with the near-term at 17 pence and the far-term at 17 pence 0625, each shrinking by 1/16 compared to last weekend. Also, the London exchange rate to New York was 3 yuan, 5 jiao and 5.</p>
<h3>No Major Changes in Silver Dollar Market</h3>
<p>The market situation remains sluggish as yesterday was Monday, and banks were open. Under normal circumstances, silver dollar transactions would be more frequent. However, it is currently the hot summer season, and buyers and sellers are not as active as usual. Therefore, the market lacks competitive heat, and prices have not changed much. The premium remains stable, with only a difference of 0.25. The silver market appears stable on the surface, but the underlying liquidity seems slightly tight. There is a relative shortage of "huatou touchen" (premium notes), but fortunately, banks had mortgage loans available the day before, otherwise, there might have been cause for concern.</p>
<p>Premium Rates Unchanged in Morning and Afternoon: "Foreign Premium" opened slightly better in the morning market, up 0.2 hao from the previous afternoon, at 6 qian 9 fen 5 li 2 hao and a half. The afternoon market saw balanced supply and demand, so the price remained unchanged, the same as the morning market. "Silver Premium" was 1 qian 4 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, slightly better by 1 fen from the previous afternoon. "Huatou jia shui" (premium notes with added water) surprisingly reached 2 qian 5 or 6 fen, with banks quoting 6 fen.</p>
<p>Small Silver Coin Rose, Copper Coins Increased: The small silver coins from the Yangtze River region remained at 6 qian 1 fen in the morning market, the same as the previous afternoon. The afternoon market was slightly higher by 0.1 li, totaling 6 qian 1 fen 1 li. Transactions were 6,500 jiao in the morning and 4,500 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver coins were 5 qian 9 fen 1 li in the morning, a significant increase of 2 li from the previous day, with 125,000 jiao transacted. The afternoon market had the same price as the morning, with 20,000 jiao transacted. Copper coins increased by 2,000 wen again, to 416,000 wen, with over 45,500 strings of wen transacted.</p>
<p>Many Silver Transfers and Collections: Yesterday, due to banks being open, there were more transfer and collection notices. With more collections than payments, the "huatou jia shui" was quite high, and "touchen" were scarce. Chinese merchant banks collected 3.4 to 3.5 million in drafts and over 6.4 million in various collections, with over 1 million in mortgage transactions and 800,000 entering warehouses. Foreign banks collected 2.7 to 2.8 million in drafts and over 7.1 million in various collections, with over 800,000 in mortgage transactions and 700,000 entering warehouses. Money shops and silver firms collected over 35 million in single transfers and over 5.2 million in "huatou" transfers. Transfers from various routes totaled over 800,000, with over 1 million in payments.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Transactions Remain Weak: Yesterday, foreign exchange transactions were slow. Drafts made 795,000 in the morning and 665,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes were 80,000 in the morning and 40,000 in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes were 141,000 in the morning and 100,000 in the afternoon. Check transactions were only 40,000 in the morning. Bank transactions were 700,000 in the morning and 600,000 in the afternoon. Transactions between foreign exchange accounts at various banks totaled over 2.1 million, with 2.6 to 2.7 million in banknotes collected and issued. Money shops and foreign exchange firms collected over 6.4 million in single transfers and over 2.5 million in "huatou" transfers. Foreign exchange loans totaled over 2.2 million, and small money shop transactions were 800,000 to 900,000.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Generally See Slight Declines</h3>
<p>The Trend is Increasingly Stable, and Market Conditions are Also Turning Clear.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for various bonds at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw scarce spot transactions, with only 15,000 yuan changing hands throughout the day. Futures trading was also quieter compared to the previous week. Market sentiment was gradually becoming inactive. In the morning session, transactions amounted to 1.4 million yuan, while the afternoon session was less than 800,000 yuan, totaling 2.185 million yuan. Transactions for most bonds were only around 300,000 yuan, with only 110,000 for the reorganization bonds and even less for the 96% consolidated bonds.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of changes, supply and demand were very balanced. Large buyers and sellers were rarely active. Therefore, the prices of various bonds were also trapped in a state of fluctuation, with very slight ups and downs. Overall, most bonds only fluctuated by around four or five jiao throughout the day, which was more lukewarm compared to the end of last week, with each slightly lower by one or two jiao. Observing the current situation in the bond market, it is difficult to expect development for the time being, and it may be temporarily necessary to see more calm. In addition, the climate this year is extremely hot, far exceeding previous years. For the convenience of business, the exchange may eventually be forced to follow past precedents and suspend part of the afternoon trading.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>(Report from American Eastern Banking Corporation)</p>
<p>On Saturday, the New York Stock Exchange opened with a firm market, but later trends were mixed, and closing prices showed ups and downs. The U.S. Congress officially adjourned at 11:30 AM on Saturday, but this did not have a special impact on the securities market, mainly because the unemployment relief bill and the issuance of financial bonds had not yet been approved by the President. The U.S. Department of Commerce released the U.S. cash export value for the first half of the year, valued at $767,838,000, and the import value at $146,175,000. The June cash export value was $226,000,000, and the import value was $18,000,000. In addition, foreign trade in June had imports of $121,000,000 and exports of $115,000,000, resulting in a surplus of $6,000,000. These reports did not have a significant impact, as the general public was already aware of recent commercial and financial conditions. Although the market was slightly weaker on Saturday, sentiment seemed very strong, so there is a possibility of further progress during the day. The Dow Jones Index for Saturday is attached below:</p>
<p>Index | July 15 | July 16 | Change</p>
<p>-------|---------|---------|--------</p>
<p>30 Industrials  | 45.47   | 42.29   | Down 0.18</p>

<p>20 Utilities     | 18.31   | 18.33   | Up 0.02</p>
<p>Attached is the Shanghai Commercial Securities Index from the American Eastern Banking Corporation:</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth Market Situation is Ordinary</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn lacks momentum in any direction, so both buyers and sellers are unenthusiastic. The futures market is filled with an ordinary atmosphere. Currently, the sellers' aggressiveness is quite weak. It is heard that 900 bales of a certain brand of yarn for delivery this month have been sent to the yarn and cloth warehouse, but a certain speculator and a certain manufacturer are quite prepared to receive them. 20-count yarn is especially welcome because the quoted price is cheaper than the market price.</p>
<p>Little Fluctuation in Human Bidding: The human bidding for Chung-hua brand cloth is quite peaceful. Neither side released huge new amounts, seemingly waiting quietly for a shift in the environment. Yesterday, the sellers offered more of the 58, 65, and 18 brands, while the buyers bought 24 and 56, etc. A total of 5,150 bales were traded in the front and back markets. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Delivery Month | Price     | Change    | Delivery Month  | Price      | Change</p>
<p>--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|------------|---------</p>
<p>July          | 144.0     | Up 0.10   | October         | 145.30     | Up 0.20</p>
<p>August        | 144.0     | Flat      | November        | 145.20     | Up 0.30</p>
<p>September     | 14.0      | Up 0.00   | December        | 145.30     | Up 0.20</p>
<p>Current Yarn Sales are Still Good: The spot sales of current yarn are still reasonably good, and it is expected that they will not be too sluggish. Selling prices have not changed. The total daily sales are about 1,500 bales. A summary of transactions by various groups is as follows:</p>
<p>Mainland: 165 | Guangdong: 265 | Amoy: 20 | Wanxian: 435 | Changsha: 30</p>
<p>-------|--------|------|---------|---------</p>
<p>Ningbo: 190 | Same Trade: 50 | Shantou: 20 | Northern Group: 70 | Datong: 5</p>
<p>Sichuan: 170 | Wuhu: 60 | Xuzhou: 23 | Yunnan: 100</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Shows a Slightly Soft Trend</h3>
<p>Cotton prices weakened slightly because of rumors that few were taking delivery this month, causing some bulls to shift to long-term contracts, giving the market a near-term weakness and a long-term stability. However, on the whole, it was a slight softening trend in a peaceful environment. It is expected that U.S. cotton will not develop much in the short term, and the favorable weather for new cotton seems sufficient to prevent the cotton market from rising.</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Bidding Flat and Weak: Zhengzhou bidding flowers fell because the bulls in the current month closed their positions. Prices for other months were flat after delivery. The largest buyers were brands such as 108, 24, and 27, while the sellers were brands such as 47, 3, 34, and 104. A total of 30,800 bales were traded in the front and back markets. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Delivery Month | Price   | Change   | Delivery Month | Price   | Change</p>
<p>--------------|---------|----------|----------------|---------|----------</p>
<p>July          | 30.45   | Down 0.25| November       | 30.65   | Down 0.10</p>
<p>August        | 30.80   | Down 0.05| December       | 30.70   | Flat</p>
<p>October       | 30.70   | Flat</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Stabilized: The factory demand for spot cotton was not too sluggish, and the market situation was stable. The following are factory transactions:</p>
<p>Shanghai Yarn Factory purchased Shaanxi Cotton: 100 bales, priced at 29.50, spot delivery to the factory.</p>
<p>Da Feng Yarn Factory purchased: Another 200 bales, priced at 29.25, also spot delivery.</p>
<p>Tongyi Yarn Factory purchased Huoji Cotton: 200 bales, priced at 28.75, also spot delivery.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Futures Flat Last Week, Spot Prices Firm</h3>
<p>British Cotton Rebounded Slightly After Selling Off</p>
<p>Bombay futures were not very active last week, and sentiment was slightly bullish. The trend seemed unlikely to fall too much, and arrivals were not high. Spot prices were very firm because factories have constant demand after selling piece goods in Bombay and Ahmedabad. Japanese merchants did not buy much, and European demand remained poor. The statistics for last week are listed below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>Item                            | 1931          | 1932</p>
<p>---------------------------------|---------------|---------------</p>
<p>Accumulated Receipts since Sept 1 | 3,308         | 1,966</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory              | 811           | 817</p>
<p>Accumulated Exports since Sept 1   | 2,245         | 874</p>
<p>Exports to Europe                | 558           | 135</p>
<p>Exports to China                 | 198           | 205</p>
<p>Exports to Japan                 | 1,265         | 497</p>
<p>Exports to Other Regions          | 24            | 37</p>
<p>Liverpool spot sales were quiet last week. In terms of futures, everything depended on harvest conditions and politics had no relationship. The market rebounded slightly on the weekend due to mainland buying and short covering, but softened again due to sales by the British Ministry of Agriculture. Although Egyptian cotton acreage decreased, the market price remained weak due to profit-taking by bulls and weakness in U.S. cotton.</p>
<h3>Upward Trend in Grain and Rice Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market in Shanghai South saw few sources from various groups, about a dozen. There was little stock in Pudong. It is heard that the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau is discussing remedies, which is encouraging. Therefore, sentiment turned active, and transactions were more concentrated than before. Because inventory was weak and prices varied widely, the premium was another corner. Early thin rice totaled four sources, with scattered stocks. Yangjian sharp rice sold in small quantities, and the market had no ups or downs. Although the assimilation of Yuan Yin was not good, there were few arrivals, and it was heard that the Zhabei market was hardening, forming a high of two corners.</p>
<p>Yesterday's rice situation in Zhabei had about seventeen or eight sources on the west road. The main street started dull but became active later. Changxi North slightly increased stocks. Top and middle prices remained stable. Qing Shi thin rice raised prices repeatedly, and buying interest was not weak. Bianyin Yuan was sold as it arrived, increasing the corner slightly. Yang Dujian's customer demand did not move, presenting a downward trend.</p>
<h3>Flour Bidding Initially Flat, Then Became Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw the market for each month initially flat but then popular after the morning opening. The Yankee wheat quotation had been down about a small corner, and sentiment was still lax, but by the second round, it stepped up steadily. The near-term months attracted attention due to smooth sales in Tianjin the previous week. It is heard that the Yantai gang bought the long-term months, and many floaters followed, so the rise was quite sharp. The factory's selling has now turned silent because mainland wheat prices have risen again. It is heard that Wuxi Gao wheat has opened to about five yuan and three corners, so hoarding is also possible. As a result, the current month rose one fen from the previous week, August rose one fen and two li and a half, September and October rose one fen and seven li and a half, November rose two fen and two li and a half, and December rose three fen.</p>
<h3>Wild Jump in Naked Short Squeeze in Current Month Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market suddenly presented huge changes in each month's market after the morning and afternoon openings. Because the current month is not far from delivery, the buyers investigated the market and found that there were not many willing to deliver. Therefore, they intended to squeeze the shorts, frequently and wildly collecting. It is heard that numbers 24 and 23 were the most active, causing the rise in the current month to reach a huge amount of one qian. It is vaguely heard that the sellers, under this attack, will collect spot goods in preparation for delivery. If this statement is true, there will still be changes in the future. The distant months also rose slightly, but the rise was not much. It is estimated that August, September, and October were each about three fen better. In the spot wheat market, high-priced goods stepped up, while medium-quality goods remained flat. Taizhou wheat was two liang and nine qian and a half, Dabula came to three liang, Song wheat was two liang and seven qian and eight fen, Huangdu wheat was two liang and eight qian and four fen, Waifu wheat was two liang and eight qian and two fen, Shuangmai wheat was two liang and eight qian and three fen, Chongming wheat was two liang and seven qian and two fen, Taicang wheat was two liang and eight qian and four fen, sub-grade to seven qian and eight fen, Zhitang wheat was two liang and nine qian, and Anting wheat was two liang and seven qian and nine fen. A total of 4,300 bales were opened and it is said that New Shen, Dahua, Fengxin, and Da have gone to handle it.</p>
<h3>Reaction After Foreign Rice Has Been Backlogged and Has Fallen Wildly</h3>
<p>Over 30,000 bales opened throughout the day, prices up two corners</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market suddenly saw a smooth outflow of customers, and the main street's turnover was also active. The market opened 25,000 bales, and even more than 10,000 bales of the first-class with customer packaging were shipped. Prices immediately rose by more than two corners. The recent surge in rice market prices and sales was really due to the excessive fatigue and decline of the past. Once there is an unexpected change, the market will immediately see a reaction. When the market was most tired last week, rice merchants repeatedly met to discuss support measures, which it is heard was quite successful. Therefore, sentiment was very good, and local customers turned to small smooth handling, and the market immediately saw a sudden rise. A small 35,000 bales were sold, priced at nine yuan and two corners to nine yuan, and old small twisted was eight yuan and nine corners to eight yuan and seven corners and a half. 500 bales of Saigon No. 1 rice were priced at ten yuan and five corners. It is estimated that 8,000 bales of old small twisted were sold by the Tianjin, Yantai, Fujian, and Guangdong gangs, and more than 10,000 bales of new small twisted were sold, and local scattered households sold 6,000-7,000 bales of small twisted, and firms that packed their own customers also sold 10,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sees Granulated and White Sugar Step Up</h3>
<p>3,000 Bags Opened and Selling Well</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market at the Sugar Merchants Association saw smooth clearing house transactions. The buying interest for Dutch sugar No. 24 granulated white sugar was very strong, and the market price stepped up again. The initial transaction price was fourteen liang three qian and a half, Hong Kong goods fourteen liang two qian and a half to three qian. As a result, the original goods price also followed, rising to fourteen liang four qian, and the market was stable, and shipments were very active, causing the buyers to be more cautious. Although the transaction for Dutch red sugar Nos. 8 and 9 at ten liang and seven qian was quiet, the market was quite firm. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was sixteen liang and three qian, CW Mark fifteen liang and eight qian, DY Mark fifteen liang and five qian, HX Mark fifteen liang and four qian, HM Mark fourteen liang and nine qian, H Mark twelve liang and five qian, PX Mark eleven liang and three qian. There were few transactions, and the market was stable. The Zhenxiang company opened for sale 2,000 bags of Hong Kong granulated white sugar, priced at fourteen liang and two qian, and was quite popular. Huaxin opened for the original granulated sugar priced at fourteen liang and four qian. The firms' intention to buy was tired because the price was high, so only several thousand bags were sold, and the market was not very strange.</p>
<h3>New Golden Needles Vegetable from North China Falls by 1-2 Liang</h3>
<p>A batch of new golden needles vegetable was collected from Zhenjiang by various firms the day before yesterday, totaling 262 bales, and yesterday they have been transferred to this warehouse. There were more arrivals this time, and the Hong Kong market price fell again, and the market suddenly turned weak. Yesterday, Guangdong, Hong Kong, Shantou, Amoy and other groups had all purchased, and prices had fallen by one or two liang. It is estimated that Daxing vegetable sold for seventeen liang to sixteen liang, Yanghua vegetable fifteen liang and a half, Zhongxing vegetable fourteen liang and a half to fifteen liang. Only most of the new arrivals were sold, and the market may be difficult to stabilize later.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Factories, also Cleared Tiredly with Silk Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market in the foreign firms in this port remained tired and quiet. The European and American firms did not see any transfers from the medium-term and current silk telegrams sent to overseas at the request of the Chinese silk merchants in the middle of last week, and the sales of white cloth from the white factories also became bleak. Yesterday, only the Huchou factory brought in 20 to 22 bales of Shanghai white cloth of medium-sized B grade, priced at only 480 liang, and the Shanghai factory brought in three bales of Jinwu brand No. 1 Qilibai Ganjing, priced at 415 liang.</p>
<h3>Needle and Eyebrow Green Tea Sells Well in Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market in the foreign firms in this port, with green teas such as needle and eyebrow from Wuyuan and Tunxi, the British firms such as Xiehe, Yih, Tianyu, and Tongfu all searched and handled them on a large scale, and other firms also scrambled to buy them, and the transactions were unusually prosperous, and the market was exceptionally firm. There were scattered transactions for items such as treasured eyebrows and tribute, but the route for the light-colored treasured eyebrows stopped. In addition, the Ping, Shui, and Lianglu from other Zhuang major gangs in the United States have not yet moved, and no one asked about Qining black tea yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal, Russian Coal is Shipped to Shanghai for Sale</h3>
<p>Russian-produced Ruichang coal is soft and suitable for use in factories and ships. This is the first batch to arrive at this port. The market price opened yesterday at twelve liang per ton, but there were no transactions due to the high price.</p>

<p>Supplement of Shen Bao</p>
<h3>Candidates Passing Higher Civil Service Exam Intend to Voluntarily Withdraw Qualifications</h3>
<p>— Foshi</p>
<p>Last year's Higher Civil Service Examination was marked by exceptionally grand ceremonies. The expenditure alone was said to have reached over a million, truly befitting a major national talent selection event.</p>
<p>According to a Beijing dispatch yesterday, "The candidates who passed the previous Higher Civil Service Examination are scheduled to hold an annual meeting on August 6th, intending to request the National Government to strictly implement the appointment of qualified candidates after passing the examination. Otherwise, all personnel will return their certificates to the Examination Yuan and voluntarily withdraw their qualifications." Based on this, it seems that none of the gentlemen who passed the Higher Civil Service Examination have been appointed, so they are now anxious and want to voluntarily withdraw their qualifications. In reality, this may not be necessary, because based on the titles of these gentlemen, the country spent over a million dollars and held a grand examination ceremony, which is not easily obtained, and should be satisfied and forgiving.</p>
<p>Originally, "Don't become an official unless you have someone in court" has always been a golden rule. If you have strong backing, you will naturally become an official even if you are not qualified. Conversely, no matter what qualifications you have, it is useless. So, when the Higher Civil Service Examination was held, I predicted it was a waste of effort, because the gentlemen who went to take the Higher Civil Service Examination must not have any behind-the-scenes support. If you had support, you would have already become an official and be content, and would not be willing to take the exam again. So I know that even if you are admitted, it will still be useless. This is a certain truth.</p>
<p>The country's selection of talent is just a façade. Please carefully calculate how many first-class important figures there are in the current government (not counting those out of office), how many second-class important figures, how many third and fourth-class important figures, and how many relatives and friends of these important figures. How many rice bowls are there in total? How can it be the turn of the gentlemen who only have qualifications and no power? The Higher Civil Service Examination has already been taken, and you have already obtained your qualifications, so the country has fulfilled its obligations regarding the examination. What else can be said?</p>
<p>Furthermore, assuming you have a strong backstage boss, it is better to become an official. Even if you mess up, you can get away with it. If you don't have a reliable backstage boss, even if you become an official, you will not be able to stay in your position peacefully. Even if you are appointed with great difficulty, it will only be a few days or months of official luck. I guarantee you will step down, and there will be no hope of a rapid rise.</p>
<p>However, not all backstage bosses are the same. It is best to have some connection with the family, as it will have unexpected effects. Other relatives are secondary, and friends are even less important. If you want to become an official, you should think about how to establish some family relationship with the most important figures. This is originally a shortcut to success. Don't take qualifications to heart.</p>

<h3>Collection of Sentences by Ding'an by Shanghai Changes</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiaqing</p>
<p>What can I do with my few students? I sigh at my wasted time in this world. Where are the five hundred men of Tian Heng? I lean alone in the southeast, shedding many tears.</p>
<p>Proposal for Collecting Grievances by Compiling Tang Poems</p>
<p>A song of Yizhou brings tears, the cold moon and mountain colors are all vast. I cannot bear to hear the border horses leaving my heart, weeping on Longdui, gazing at my homeland.</p>
<p>Sending Interest in Collecting Works</p>
<p>Plum blossoms surround the walls, my dreams are pure, experiencing the famous fields and changing states. I just buy Qingshan and sleep soundly, spreading my poetic name in the countryside.</p>
<p>The Confucius wall is hazy, and the lost threads are exhausted. The nine borders are familiar, like carving insects. Now the extinct school is truly extinct, and I glance at the talent and the emptiness of the sea.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Summer Cool-off Poem</h3>
<p>— Rangshui</p>
<p>After visiting Hatong Garden, I then visited the French Park to watch the Vietnamese soldiers practice.</p>
<p>How can there be a home without a country? The desolate trees are left with perching crows. Can you remember the heartbreaking things at the fountain? The road to my homeland is far away, and my eyes are strained.</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>Alas, how can I catch up with the dead heroes? The surviving soldiers are even more sad. Sharing the same hatred for the destruction of our country, I also pity these words for the tourists.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Insecticide, Disinfectant, and Preservative</h3>
<p>— Dream</p>
<p>Summer diseases are half transmitted by lice and insects, and half caused by carelessness in handling food. If effective and economical medicines can be used artificially to kill insects, and appropriate disinfection and preservation measures are applied to food, microorganisms will have no chance to develop, and the source of disease will be cut off. Here are some of the most common preservatives and insecticides, which are also part of household hygiene.</p>
<p>Carbolic Acid: Carbolic acid solution is an extremely effective insecticide. However, it is extremely poisonous and should not be ingested or come into contact with the eyes. It is very effective for removing lice or as a disinfectant for non-food items. It is available in all pharmacies, but it is quite complicated to make it yourself.</p>
<p>Sulfur: Sulfur is a good insecticide, especially for bedbugs. Sprinkling sulfur powder or applying a paste of sulfur and water inside bed frames or palm fiber mattresses can eliminate bedbugs. For full room disinfection, burn sulfur in the room to create sulfur dioxide. If the air in the room is dry, it is very toxic to fleas, flies, and other pests, and can prevent insect eggs from hatching. However, it has very little effect on microorganisms. Therefore, it is best to spray a small amount of water to humidify the room air, which will increase its ability to kill bacteria at the same time. Generally, burning two to three pounds of sulfur in 1,000 cubic feet for 24 hours can completely kill bacteria. Therefore, it is best to use this type of disinfection in rooms where someone has died from an infectious disease.</p>
<p>Salicylic Acid: An effective preservative. Because it is non-toxic, it can be used to preserve food. Adding a small amount to food or paste (Western paste can be made with it) can prevent spoilage for a long time. It has a very strong ability to prevent the growth of bacteria. This substance is available in pharmacies and is very cheap (about 20 cents can be used 30-40 times). It is complicated and uneconomical to make it yourself.</p>
<p>Boric Acid: Everyone knows that boric acid water disinfects. It is also very cheap (usually used to wash eyes). Although its bactericidal power is relatively weak, its preservative power is very strong. Adding one part boric acid and one part borax to milk can prevent acidification. It is commonly used in foods such as butter and cheese.</p>
<p>Of the above four types, two are insecticides and disinfectants, and two are preservatives. There are few mosquitoes and flies in Shanghai, but bedbugs are a constant problem. They first appear in pine boards, and then spread throughout the room, making them difficult to control. Using the above-listed insecticides can quickly cure them. Food spoilage and unwanted fermentation can be avoided by using the above two types of preservatives. Adding a small amount of preservative to household cooking, milk, or yellow wine can prevent the growth of microorganisms and keep them fresh for a long time. The reporter has tested this in practice and achieved good results, so I dare to tell the readers.</p>

<h3>The Life of Ah San in Hell</h3>
<p>— Huanhua</p>
<p>In a corner of the alley, there is a different world. An Ah San gentleman has set his sights on this piece of land as a temporary dormitory. Two newspapers are spread on the ground as bedding. On one side of the wall, two nails are nailed, and a rope made of torn rags is tied to hold a three-foot cube of old burlap bag. It can be considered a blanket or a tent. If it is to be considered a tent, just lie down facing the wall and pull the burlap bag behind you, then the tent is fully established. Fortunately, there is a natural screen of a trash can at the head, and a high-end hatbox is placed at the foot, with an overpass building covering it. This place is weatherproof. In the eyes of Ah San, it looks like a magnificent and comfortable nest.</p>
<p>Mr. Ah San has nothing to do all day long. He lies in the tent and takes out his favorite smoking set, which is a short bamboo gun, a smoking lamp made of a Western candle head and a waste light bulb cover, and a wire needle. He puts the cigarette can into the teapot, where he smokes the red pill ash discarded by others, taking pleasure in his leisure. He sucks one puff after another, but unfortunately there is not much ash, so he has to suck it into the bowl and then dig it out of the bowl, digging and sucking again, repeating the process endlessly.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>When the tobacco craving is satisfied, he takes the rectangular tin box used for biscuits and begs for leftovers from the households in the alley. After a hearty meal, he sits on that special bed, takes off his short shirt with hundreds of holes in his hand, and issues an order to exterminate the lice that are as dense as pearls. He picks them out one by one and puts them into his mouth, like eating fried soybeans. From his smiling expression, you can see that he is enjoying himself.</p>
<p>Another Mr. Ah San, with a burlap bag full of oil stains on his upper body, wearing a pair of broken shoes of different sizes picked up from the garbage dump, and his hair is four or five inches long, forming cakes. He is holding a magnetic-eroded iron washbasin as his dining furniture. Every day at twelve o'clock, the hunger in his stomach naturally tells him that it is noon and that he should go to the paradise he goes to every day to wait for his god of food to descend.</p>
<p>He braves the wind and rain, using his two legs as a car, and rushes to the entrance of this alley. After a while, a waiter from a restaurant delivering meals comes out of a house in the alley with plates and bowls. He jumps forward like a child seeing a nanny, and pours all the leftovers that people have not finished eating into the washbasin. He sits on the steps of a cooler house and uses his five fingers as nimble chopsticks to enjoy slowly. He is determined not to give up until he has licked all the remaining juice in the basin.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he looks for two cigarette butts on the nearby ground to light and smoke to relieve his fullness. Sometimes, when he arrives at the entrance of the alley and sees that it is still early, he runs to the houses in the area opposite the alley in the human flesh market to ask for a few copper coins. As long as he stands at the door, the foul smell emanating from his body and the fragrance of the modern salted meat ladies fight each other, they will willingly take out money for him. He never fails to win.</p>
<p>Family Problems</p>
<h3>Family Education</h3>
<p>— Youru</p>
<p>"Good boy, don't cry! Listen, the 'Old Turtle' who sells cooked side dishes is here. I'll buy you five copper coins worth of beef to eat." When the mother couldn't stop her son from crying, she used this "promise" as a condition to stop her son from crying.</p>
<p>"Mom, the Old Turtle is here! Call him into the alley! Where's the money? Hurry up and give it to me, I'll buy it myself." The son urged his mother urgently to fulfill the verbal contract just now.</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Where would Mom get so much extra money to buy you snacks? If you want money, why don't you ask your dad? He dresses well, eats well, and even gambles and visits prostitutes. He doesn't care about his son at all! Yesterday, I was still telling him that Ah Bao's classmates go to the Great World every day, watch dog races, play in dance halls, and have a lot of fun. I asked him when he would learn to go out and play for a while, so that the child wouldn't be envious of others. Who knew he would pull a long face and ignore me!"</p>
<p>"Mom, why doesn't Dad pay attention to Mom?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Good son, how would you know about your dad's affairs? He's been fighting like fire with that 'dirty bitch' since he got her! With her, why would he care about your mom?"</p>
<p>"Mom, didn't you say that salted meat old man? I always see Dad and have to scold him to vent my anger for Mom!"</p>
<p>"Good son! My good son! What you said is right, that kind of father really deserves to be scolded! If you can be so filial to Mom, Mom will definitely buy you a pair of foreign new leather shoes. When your birthday comes, you can wear them to show off!"</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen! Please look at the story above. Isn't it often heard in Chinese families? Analyzing and commenting on such ordinary words, we can at least get the following meanings:</p>
<p>(1) There is no need to keep one's word, as long as it can deal with the present situation.</p>
<p>(2) Anyone old can be casually scolded as an "Old Turtle."</p>
<p>(3) Develop children's habits of eating unsanitary snacks and spending money recklessly.</p>
<p>(4) Enlighten children with knowledge of places such as game halls, dog racing tracks, and dance halls... and arouse their bad desires?</p>
<p>(5) Implant in children's minds the impressions of "gambling," "prostitution," "dirty bitches," and "salted meat"...</p>
<p>(6) Guide and encourage children to resist the reason of their elders.</p>
<p>(7) Leather shoes must be foreign-made, which can at least cultivate children's psychology of despising domestic products and valuing foreign goods.</p>
<p>(8) Children also study to celebrate their birthdays, and even teach him to show off. This is because they are afraid that he has no vanity, and they are actually encouraging and guiding him.</p>
<p>Alas! This is Chinese family education!</p>

<h3>At a Dinner Party</h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>He couldn't stand the cunning and deceitful machinations on the political stage, so he secretly returned from Nanjing. He thought that his actions were unbeknownst to anyone, but that evening he received a notice for a dinner party - after graduation, he and several like-minded classmates held a dinner party once a month. He suspected that their methods were so clever; so he changed his clothes, smiled slightly at the thin teenager in the mirror, and wished himself good luck in finding a job in Shanghai that suited his personality.</p>
<p>He followed the address on the notice and stepped into the Xinghualou Restaurant. Little Zhang seemed surprised, when did Maodun (because he admired Maodun) return?</p>
<p>It was still early, and only Little Zhang asked the waiter to move the orange rows of tables. The two old friends who had not seen each other for a long time briefly talked about what had happened since their separation. He asked how they knew he had returned to Shanghai?</p>
<p>"Where? The recent regulations of the association have not changed the address. No matter what, we send the notice at the end of each month."</p>
<p>In a flash, the guests were seated, and they expressed special welcome for his return. Because the association publishes a magazine, and he has the alias of Maodun, he naturally has a considerable understanding of literature and art.</p>
<p>After a few rounds of wine, the atmosphere at the table was unusually thick. Everyone's face showed a rare smile, and everyone forgot that their current lives were completely opposite to their hopes in school. The small restaurant was filled with the vitality of youth, just like the life a few years ago.</p>
<p>The direction of the conversation turned to his political life, because among the classmates present, he was the only one who had been on the political stage after graduation. He drank a glass of wine, a bitter smile appeared at the corner of his mouth, and said.</p>
<p>"The political stage is like a dyeing vat, where white materials change color; it is also like the old civilized drama, where cats jump and dogs bark." His fiery eyes stared at a certain point and continued, "Alas! If I were a woman, I would rather sell my body."</p>
<p>He was originally a skeptic, and his words were even more bizarre after returning from Nanjing. The classmates at the table of course knew his temperament, so they diverted the conversation to sound movies, dance halls, and other topics.</p>
<p>He asked about everyone's lives. They were either small clerks in a foreign company or teachers in a small school. He wanted to find a job in Shanghai that suited his personality, but it gave him another disappointment.</p>
<p>He sullenly drank wine and returned home. On the bank of the Dongxin Bridge, he heard a miserable cry, "Here it comes! Here it comes!" "Is it so difficult to sell one's body?" He said to himself, walking home with his long shadow, thinking of a maxim: "To eat, one must be corrupt! And cunning and deceit are the working steps of corruption!"</p>
<p>End</p>
<h3>Stepping Out of School</h3>
<p>— Yuxian</p>
<p>I vaguely remember a cooler long night, when a few friends chatted idly on the grass in the campus. The lamplight shone down through the scattered gaps in the trees, and we could still see a few shining faces. All future hopes were smiling contentedly at that moment. It was the night of the graduation ceremony. Six years of studying under the window had earned us a diploma, but once the classmates separated, the true feelings of reluctance prompted us to have one last dinner party. The scene of laughter and lively conversation at the dinner party, who knew that it would be replaced by the melancholy of today's memories!</p>
<p>In early summer, the weather was cool in the morning. A car was heading towards the railway station in the gentle breeze. Jun and Wei were my closest friends. I couldn't refuse their enthusiasm, and I was actually reluctant to part with the last moment of being together. They sent me to the station. The station seemed to have changed its atmosphere, suffocating us and making us unable to say a word. A gloomy and depressed mood of separation completely occupied everyone's hearts. Finally, in the miserable farewell of "keep in touch often," the train headed towards my hometown. I occupied a corner of the carriage, imagining their dejection when they returned to school, and I couldn't help but shed tears silently.</p>
<p>My hometown was gradually approaching. The station where we had parted on a snowy night six years ago showed a decorated smiling face in the sunlight to welcome me. The hometown accent that I hadn't heard for a long time was gradually mixing with the noise; in the crowd, an apple-like small face was raising its hand and shouting my name. That was my younger brother, Pingying, whom I hadn't seen for six years, and he had grown so tall.</p>
<p>The hometown in my dreams was realized in front of me. It was not as wonderful as I had dreamed. After a week, I really felt it. This was my first taste of the bitterness of life, and it was also something unexpected after stepping out of school.</p>
<p>The conflicts between family members cannot be searched out from the faces of others by those who have not experienced them themselves, and those who have suffered its hardships do not bother to tell others in detail, because even if they can get the sympathy of others, sympathy cannot help me. Now I am being squeezed out of my hometown by the four words "family conflict," but it does not include "marriage" or even smaller things.</p>
<p>I was back on the train that had sent me back to my hometown on a drifting journey. No one saw me off, and no one pitied me. The lack of true sympathy in mankind was exposed here, and a cup full of bitter wine was placed in front of everyone who had been abandoned.</p>
<p>Three days later, I found out about Jun and Wei's whereabouts. They had jointly opened a bookstore, and I was responsible for proofreading and writing some things. Life was also very peaceful. The three of us lived together on the upper floor of the editorial office. The three of us lived for life. We worked very seriously, although we often had to stay up past midnight before we could sleep peacefully, but both our body and mind were very comfortable. After a month, it was already the Mid-Autumn Festival, a time for family reunions.</p>
<p>On the cool terrace of the editorial office, we were drinking wine at what could hardly be called a banquet. The moonlight was of course very sacred, shining all over the world, but the joys and sorrows of the world could not be understood by the sacred moonlight.</p>
<p>"Why don't you go home?" I drank a glass of wine and asked with some feeling.</p>
<p>"What about you?"</p>
<p>"I can't go home even though I have one!" I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"I can't go home even though I have one;" Jun repeatedly chanted, while raising a glass of wine and drinking it all in one gulp.</p>
<p>"Friends!" Jun's voice became impassioned, "Friends who can't go home, join hands and drink this cup together!"</p>
<p>The moonlight peeked out from the dark clouds to watch us drink together. The atmosphere at the dinner table became thick again. We talked about Zhuo's circus, Ibsen's A Doll's House, love stories between friends, and then the mischievous life at school...</p>
<p>When the banquet was over, Jun solemnly said, "From now on, no one is allowed to shed a tear, or let down our courage."</p>
<p>We extended our life for half a year in an environment where we were not allowed to cry:</p>
<p>The bookstore was raided due to some suspicion. Jun and Wei fled, and I was only responsible for proofreading and was not in trouble.</p>
<p>After that, my life drifted aimlessly. During that time, I also returned home to plant bamboo and raise turtles, and repented in seclusion, but in the end, "home" could not belong to me.</p>
<p>Alas! Drifting! Drifting! The seventh and seventeenth nights.</p>
