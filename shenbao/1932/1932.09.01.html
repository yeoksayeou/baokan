<p>時評</p>
<h3>再論東北問題與美日關係</h3>
<p>華</p>
<p>自去年九一八事變後美國對於中日問題曾有三次正式表示其一即由國務卿面致日本駐美大使出淵氏之備忘錄其二十月五日發出之覺書其三本年一月七日致中日兩國相同之照會自是以後美日間關於我東北事件之正式外交文書即已停止而惟藉國務卿斯汀生氏非正式之言論以表示美國之態度斯氏於二月二十五日公表其致參議院外交委員長波拉氏長函一通書中根據以前正式表示之主旨備述美國對華所取門戶開放及機會均等之政策並指斥日本破壞九國公約與非戰公約其時適吾十九路軍與第五軍在淞滬積極抗日故公表後甚引起世界各國之注意而日本則深爲反對謂足助長中國抗日之情緒八月八日斯氏又於紐約外交調查會席上演說擁護非戰公約而隱斥日本在我東北之暴行日人聞之舉國譁然甚致有人主張向美國質問最近日本内田外相在臨時議會大放厥詞準備承認僞組織而美竟默然未有何種表示豈美國竟亦如所謂銀樣蠟銷頭乎抑美政府明知日本軍閥如中瘋狂不可以理喻正擬以别種方法對付之乎此問題與未來東亞之局勢大有關係竊就管見所及再討論之</p>
<p>依過去情形論美政府似早已覺悟東北問題非口舌所可解决故自本年一月七日以後斯汀生對於東北問題即不復以正式外交文書對日作何表示與交涉而僅僅於書翰及演詞中表示美政府對於本問題之立塲與態度其表示也並非妄冀日本軍閥懸崖勒馬回復常態却是向列强作嚶嗚之求呼將伯之助冀有與國作粰鼓之應爲共同對日之備良以現代作戰範團廣犧牲大一得一失關繫於國運之隆替又至鉅不有與國未可操切從事日法近似親密而美猶立於孤立之境地美國審時度勢非先於外交上用準備工夫不可故暫時不得不取觀望態度</p>
<p>然美於現在欲亟求能相合作之與國殊不易易在昔英國純粹工黨内閣時代首相麥唐納雖採聯美政策顧在現在國民内閣秉政之時情形已有變更歐陸近方多事欲英助美抗日恐亦不易最近美國上下有對俄復交之呼聲俄美兩國主義上根本不同今有此呼聲足見美國對日似因一時尋不着利害相同患難相共之與國不得已而想求其次矣美之對日今猶徘徊觀望未採何種有力行動其主因或即在此</p>
<p>或謂美無與國何不單獨與日抗爭則應之曰從軍事觀察美在遠東海軍根據地殊虞不足菲島非海軍根據地關島上軍事設備猶未完成贸然作戰反有先失太平洋上原有島嶼之危險雖美之空軍優於日日之持久戰能力不如美然美海軍苟鮮勝算則美日相隔太遠空軍亦難施展其宏大之威力次從經濟觀察日占美輸入第二位占美輸出第五位兩國商業經濟關係異常密切設若持久作戰美國雖有勝算然而不但對日商務完全犧牲抑且曠日持久又難保無意外之變化此亦美國所不能不顧慮者因此二因美國在未得與國以前恐其對日决無何等積極行動本年十一月美國將改選總統胡佛如仍蟬聯一旦得到與國尙有從速對日積極相抗之可能不然將靜待明年三月四日卸任由繼任總統主持一切故從各方面觀察與設想美國對日雖在將來必然發生衝突但衝突之發生爲期恐未必甚早</p>
<p>上述情形日人亦必洞悉是以吾人預料在最近期間日本對我侵略其勢將愈益猛進國人丁此時難惟有咬緊牙關抱大無畏大犧牲精神誓本自身之努力以與堅持抵抗到底一息尙存此志不容稍懈近得京訊日本如實行承認僞組織中央决明令討伐此訊若確實爲前途一綫之曙光吾人深信吾國目今雖立於孤立寡助之國際地處境甚苦然誠能奮起以最大之努力與日周旋國際局勢必有變化不但美國必予相當的援助即尙未復交之俄國當亦同情於我不致左袒帝國主義之日本而吾國不難左右逢源解除孤立之困况蓋我果集中力量一致對日實凡世界上擁護國際公法公約與一切平和保障者最好之與國也</p>

<p>日兵五百名抵海倫之初、駐各商號、對我軍舊有軍營、並不去住、旋陸續增兵二千餘名、先後共到三千餘名、在大街小巷設置各種障礙物、以防我軍之攻擊、並用鐵絲在小巷中間織成障礙網、中間留門、畫開夜閉、凡十字街及大街、均用蔴袋裝土壘成砲台、晝夜嚴防、其後日軍步騎三百名又開到海北鎭駐防、設備與海倫同、步兵少校隊長石川茂氏、入鎭之始、公買公賣、不料於六月十日夜間、馬主席所屬鄧文旅長派某團騎兵二百餘名、偷越鎭壕、入鎭向日本守衛兵開槍射擊、雙方當即開戰、約戰五句鐘之久、天明、我軍退出、擊斃日兵十餘名、負傷六七名、活捉四名、我方戰死士兵五六名、不意我軍退後、日人誣詆海北鎭居民、裏應外合、當將鎭内居民及早晨趕集之鄉民、剌殺及活埋一百零八人、遇見壯年男子、即以剌刀殺之、就地埋葬、不問街心巷内、遍地塋葬、該石川隊長、遂報吿旅團長平賀貞藏、謂海北鎭居民均通馬、無有好人、請用砲火將全鎭燬滅、十二日、日方即派遣砲兵支隊、携帶山砲數尊、由海倫出北門、向海北鎭進發、行至七星泡地方、砲車陷落泥溝中、百拉不出、嗣後又經海倫徵收局局長及商會會長等、向平賀司令求情、滅亡浩刦、始得倖免、海北八千生靈、幾乎慘遭毒害、此役雖則逢凶化吉、然零星虐待、在所難免、自此之後、日軍對於商民、食宿買賣、任意搶奪、復又暗縱鮮民、强搶敲詐、種種情形、筆難罄述日方在海倫城内、每日接到密信甚多、如有人挾嫌向日方密吿某人、誣爲馬主席之偵探者、即被逮捕、立時槍殺活埋、海倫每日下午八點鐘凈街、稍逾鐘點、即殺不容、自五月四日以來、海倫海北商號、完全閉門停業、後雖强制復業、因無農人趕集、開門等於閉門、海北鎭之浩刦、較海倫爲尤甚、因海北乃赴通北克山等處必經之路、日軍北行、定必經過、嗣後日方復抓人背負子彈給養等物、如果潛逃、即被槍殺、鎭内車馬牛、均已逃避一空、最後鎭内居民祇剩十分之一、</p>

<p>最可慮者、馬主席之軍隊、已陷於孤立無緩危險萬狀之境、中央如延不出兵、恐難久持、因日軍對馬主席、抱十二分之决心、每次與馬交戰、陸空連絡齊擊、空軍除投彈爆炸外、並作砲兵之目標、砲火異常兇猛、馬軍又無防空武器、祇以血肉抗敵、别無善策、子彈尤爲缺乏也、</p>

<p>昨日本埠日文報紙、載日海軍司令杉坂、將要求我國報紙、取消［排日］［侮日］之記載、幷表示决計將以斷然手段處置、其辦法、大約將與上海事變前對民國日報事相同、事態似頗危險、但日領則謂、杉坂僅向日記者表示、將要求中國報紙對［排日］［侮日］消息、加以取締、幷無所謂倣對付民國日報之事、</p>

<h3>葉恭綽談負責運輸</h3>
<p>路商兩方應開誠商榷</p>
<p>鐵路應有充分之準備</p>
<p>鐵道部此次頒行鐵路負責運輸通則、定於今日起實行、日前鐵部業務司司長兪　來滬、招待各界、報吿負責運輸意義、連日商界頻加討論、記者以此事關係甚鉅、特走謁交通界前輩葉恭綽氏、叩其對於負責運輸之意見、承葉氏發表譚話如下、葉氏云、鐵路負責運輸、乃世界通行辦法、吾國各路、以種種原因、有已舉辦者、有尙未舉辦者、但以現在世界潮流而論、全國各路、均應一律辦理、惟在舉辦以前、應先作相當之準備、庶幾定期實行、客商不致感覺不便、亦不致引起誤會、各路員司、對實行負責運輸、似很多顧慮、但以北寗·膠濟·兩路言、辦理負責運輸、亦未覺其有不良之結果也、北寗路於舉辦之初、路員對賠償損失、很爲憂慮、恐爲數過多、鐵路不勝負担、但結果一年之中、平均不過賠償一萬餘元、余意無論何種事業、於舉辦之初、總難免有利害小衝突、爲事業前途着想、任何方面、應將利害丢開、以輔助其進行、此次鐵道部所頒行之鐵路負責運輸通則、或者某路有特别情形時、似可於施行細則上、另有特别規定、務使適合各該路之情况、以利進行、普通商家對於政府所頒佈之法令規章、每苦其複雜、因此缺少研究、而許多利益、乃爲第三者所得、余意商家最好能直接與鐵路彼此作開誠佈公之商榷、對於認爲障礙之點、不妨加以討論、加以研究、務將此種障礙割除、同時鐵路方面亦應將必須準備之事、加緊充分準備、譬如車輛·倉庫·碼頭·等等皆是、雖目下鐵路財政艱窘、達於極點、但鐵路補助商貨流通、萬不能稍加漠視也、負責運輸爲極正當之事業、如欲眞正辦好、如欲有美滿結果、各路員司、亦應有很大的努力、若言商界反對、余意恐係一種暫時之誤會、蓋負責運輸爲一極普通之事、而且其他各路、亦已有相當經騐、初無障礙之可言也、</p>

<h3>費唐報吿第四卷槪要</h3>
<p>費唐法官報告之第四卷、刻已經工部局將英文本印就、該卷内容、幾盡係關於工部局内部行政手續之討論、其研究所及、有委員會制度之改進、財政委員會職權　審計員之任命與職權、局董之任期資格及其服務規律、局中職員地位之保障等等、茲將該卷之内容、撮要叙述於後、</p>
<p>▲委員制度應予改進　費唐法官以爲將來如照渠　、將局董數目增至二十二人以上、三十人以、内則董事會處理事務之方法、不得不行改變、卽現在局董未增、而亦有可以改革之處、現行之議事辦法、不甚重正式的形式、而委員會制度之利益、亦未能充分表見、現今委員會對各事爲初步之考慮、而以其結論式建議載之紀錄、而送致於董事會、委員會自身無行政之權、故一切必有待於董事會之决定、是以未見有分土之利、然現今之委員會委員、多有非董事而因其知　經騐或關係由局方聘請加入者委員之中、旣非盡係董事、則爲地產章程所限、委員會自不能有執行之權、而僅可處於諮詢之地位矣、</p>
<p>▲行政主官事權略重　委員會旣無行政之權、然現今董事會之事務、亦未見特别緊重者、蓋各行政部分之主任職員·以及總裁·與財務處長、按照習慣、頗可負責以處分一切例行事件、而不必事事請示於董事會、惟關係行政方針者、則必俟董事會之指導、然而何者係屬例行·何者有關於方針、其分别殆由各主任行政員自行决斷之、因此委員會之權頗絀、而行政主官之權頗重、但行政主官之權、仍因下述二項而有限制、一卽總裁有槪括的轄權、而財務處長亦有財政上之監察權、二則依習慣及定例、總董亦有親自督率之權、且近今習慣、總董每日必以多量時間親蒞局中、而總董又常係連選連任、因之總董成爲各行政員及董事會間之連絡環、而其地位亦因之增重、然而雖有上述之限制、而究不免偶有行政主官之處置與董事會之見解政策不一致之危險、且使委員會委員、對於該項事務發生隔膜、是在現制之中、個人性格之關係太大、應將委員會制予以發展、以爲行政上之安全保障、此非剥奪行政主官自由處分之權、但對選民負責者乃董事會、故董事會必須能善爲監督各部分之行政也、關於委員會之數目、費唐法官主張設常任委員會五個或六個、（圖書音樂委員會改爲特别委員會、）以代現有之八委員會、其職權以明文規定、分爲執行的及諮詢的兩類、每兩星期、舉行常會一次、以省通函之繁、委員會之紀錄、應另行繕具報告、以報吿於董事會、以便董事會之處理、且宜於公布、至於聘請之委員額數、應予確定、不得過全數三分之一、</p>
<p>▲查賬員應明確規定　查公共租界地產章程、曾規定應行查賬、並向年會報告、但查賬員之如何選定、及其停給與保障、資格與職權、均無規定、費唐法官之建議、爲（一）應將查賬之舉、明文規定、著爲定例、（二）查賬員須爲依法合格之人、局董及局員皆不得充任、（三）如果將來中外納稅人分别各行聚會、則兩會各舉一查賬員、（四）應選之查賬員候補人、其資格應先行審定、其薪俸由局中規定之、（五）查賬員任期至少三年、（六）查賬員須有相當之權力、俾能行其職務、（七）以特蘭斯哇制度爲參考、規定查賬員之證書格式、</p>
<p>▲董事之資格及限制　按照公共租界地產章程、充任局董者、只須具備一種財產的資格、但照各地市政通例、則對於某某種人不得任巾董、頗有限制、現今公共租界之習慣、凡局中職員、卽不能當選、此亦因局員免納稅捐、故無復選舉之權、如果將來局董增額、而任期延長爲二年、則資格一層、應再加明文規定、又如董事常常缺席、及因故長期不能出席、應令其退職、又如所議之事、有與董事之個人經濟有關係、應令迥避一層、現今無明文可據、僅臨時斟酌其應否迥避、深爲不便、不過此項迥避制度、亦不可過嚴、否則一般殷實商人、或且視局董爲畏途、而不復敢擔任矣、補救之法、惟有將局中與商家訂定合同之事、予以公開、則流弊可免也、</p>
<p>▲財委會之權應增加　財政委員會之職權、費唐法官主張應予以鄭重規定、庶凡重要之財政設施、皆先經該委員會討論、然後繕具報告、以陳之董事會、假如將來納稅人年會之制度更改、則預算或將由董事會爲最終之决定、財政委員會須有權審查其他各委員所認可之支出預計、總支出數目之大小、何種捐稅之應徵收、及其入欵之如何分配於各項事業、預算通過之後、財政委員會仍應監察各部分、不得溢支、不得濫用、現今之制度、監察用途之權在財務處長、但觀於英國各地之市政府、其於財政上之監督、以及事先之籌畫、均甚得財政委員會之力、現今之財務委員會、除議預算外、聚會頗少、應使之常年以定期聚會、而令財務處長與其委員會之關係、更爲密接、</p>
<p>▲常任職員應加保障　現今制度、局員之養老金、非依法而可卽得之者、蓋所用人員、旣限於三年期之合同、而局中又有以六個月通告免　之權力、故局員未必能依其服務年數而得養老金、是應修正地產章程、推行此制、使局員服務獲得永久性質之保障、蓋凡爲公共機關之職員、於其執行職務之時、難保無觸犯輿情、或與有勢力之私人利益相衝突、必須使其本身地位得有保障、庶可以不屈不撓、奉公守法、此實非保護局員之個人、而實以保護公衆之利益、假如來日租界之治理機關有根本之更動、則爲行政效率及職員之利益計、凡退職者、應予以公平之待遇外、仍應保留一大半有經騐之職員、以繼續一切行政、在現今過渡時期之中、不獨應引進華人、使任高級職員、亦須保留並能招致充份的合格外籍職員、第一、當規定在某等級以上之職員、經過若干時之試用後、卽可令其永久服務、第二、當制定一種仲裁辦法、以判斷公安局與局員之事議、局員之進用、應設一任用委員會、關於永久職員服務上之問題、以及某等職員之黜退、均由該委員會爲最終之决斷、又關於年金之應否全數給與、亦可由委員會决斷、如以委員人多、不便裁决、則可以三人仲裁之、一人由局推舉、一人由該管領事推舉、另一人由上二人公推、或由委員會推定之、如此規定、則局員不　無保障矣、</p>

<h3>上週疫勢大减</h3>
<p>伍連德之報告</p>
<p>海港檢疫處處長兼上海防止霍亂臨時事務所主任伍連德、昨日（八月三十一日）發表第十四期霍亂週報、茲誌錄如下、（一）上週末（八月二十七日）據紀錄所知、一週内共祇霍亂二五八例、較前週三四七例、顯已減少、是霍亂疫氛、已大見減輕矣、茲將上週發見霍亂地點分述如左、</p>
<p>區域　例數　　　　　　　　死亡數</p>
<p>上海市　七五　　　　　　　　二</p>
<p>公共租界二Ｏ（内有外僑三人）一二（内有外僑二人）</p>
<p>法租界　九二（内有外僑一人）三</p>
<p>不詳區域二　　　　　　　　　Ｏ</p>
<p>上周共計二五八（内有外僑四人）一七（内有外僑二人）</p>
<p>以前共計三七一四（内有外僑六十六人）三七二（内有外僑一）</p>
<p>七人）</p>
<p>總計三九七二（内有外僑七十人）二九Ｏ（内有外僑一九人）</p>
<p>（二）截至上週末止、計發現霍亂約共四千例、内有外僑七十人、死亡數爲二九Ｏ例、内有外僑十九人、由此推算、卽華人之患霍亂者爲三九Ｏ二例、死亡二七一例、卽華人之霍亂死亡比率爲百分之六·九、外僑之患霍亂者爲七Ｏ例、死亡一九例、卽外僑霍亂死亡比率爲百分二七·一、（三）目前上海霍亂疫氛、確有消滅之趨向、觀乎近來各時疫醫院診務近狀、卽可推想而知、蓋各院病床、類均虚懸無人、尤以西藏路時疫醫院爲甚、查該院能容病床三千餘只、自霍亂流行後、救治患者、不可勝計云、（四）近據各海港報吿宣稱、各該埠霍亂趨勢、亦見同樣之輕滅、如八月二十日週末、據厦門報吿、有霍亂病九七例、死亡二一例、廣州七例、死亡二例、漢口一一三例、死亡二Ｏ例、汕頭四九例、死亡一一例、塘沽二例、死亡一例、天津一例、南京八月二十七日週末報吿、九三例、死亡七例（五）青島一埠、雖經嚴密之預防、亦于七月十一日、被霍亂侵襲、至八月二十日、計共發現霍亂病五二例　死亡十例、按前週爲一八例、死亡四例、（六）秋凉已屆、疫勢已減、凡屬服務于霍亂時疫醫院及化騐室或奔走救治于霍亂流行區者、往日工作之艱苦、今亦可以稍事休息矣、上海地大人衆、此次虎疫流行、竟能平穩度過、收此良果、胥賴衛生當局之處理得當、因此雖有三百五十萬人口廣大區域、而霍亂死亡之比率、僅占百分之七、誠屬難能可貴、抑亦確有研究之價値也、</p>

<h3>送鄭兆佳往美洲意見</h3>
<p>爲求中國網球界復興</p>
<p>請鄭君到加利福亞去</p>
<p>贊成林寳華一同赴美</p>
<p>希望一致提倡</p>
<p>留心上海網球情形的朋友、沒有不一致的說、鄭兆佳是上海未來的錦標、亦卽中華將來之第一席國手、然而以鄭君之天才久、留在上海是决不會得甚麽進展的、林邱是一個先例、於是爲求中國網球的復興、恢復八屆遠東會的光榮、大家一致的主張請鄭君到美國去、而林寶華也很透澈的寫了一信、在大陸報上發表、是否姑且不論、這是我們的意見、</p>
<h3>加利福尼亞州最適當</h3>
<p>當然不用說、以鄭君的天才、在美國能住下一年二載、技術的長進、經各名家的陶冶、一定是青雲直上、爲求中國網球界復興、是非請鄭君到美國去不可、更其加利福尼亞州、美國網球明星集中、和發祥地、</p>
<h3>不希望鄭君犧牲學業</h3>
<p>然而鄭君尙在求學的時期、决不能因爲要成一個特殊網球家、而犧牲他全部的學業、所以最妥當的辦法、還是到加利福尼亞去留學幾年、像梵恩斯就是南加大的一位學生、</p>
<h3>恊進會希望起來提倡</h3>
<p>鄭君的家况、我們尙未知道、如此的往美洲去、經濟上的負担、當然不小、在今日中國什麽尙且顧不到的辰光、要求政府幫些忙、是不可得、所以我想愛好網球、熱心體育事業、和希望中國能在運動中爭些面上的朋友、大家却應該起來表示提倡、而中華全國體育恊進會、更可起來做個首倡、</p>
<p>贊成林寳華同去</p>
<p>假使成爲事實了、鄭君是去了、其次的問題、是這樣、不過造成了一個鄭兆佳、譬如要參加台維斯杯的話、孤軍不成旅、到惠勃爾豋、孤另另在成就方面恐怕很少、所以我們十二分盼望林寶華同去、</p>
<h3>林寳華也有希望的</h3>
<p>不少的人反對林、因爲技術退步、實在退步的原因、就是找不到練習的機會、林君今尙二十六、以其天才、自然也是希望無窮的一位、更其鄭君出其門下、今年夏季雙打合作的成練、更其是堅决我們林君有同去必要的相信、我們要向積極方面去、消極換句話、是自殺、</p>
<h3>徵求公衆的意見</h3>
<p>至於鄭林二君的赴美、有人是贊成請政府當局和外交部幫些忙、我們是這樣的提議、如何進行、很希望注意這問題的朋友、發表些高見、大家來促成這事情的實現、機會是再不能錯過、</p>

<h3>記樂善堂</h3>
<p>— 徐景賢</p>
<p>曩誦清初藝術家墨井道人詩，有云：［此喜非常喜，鐸聲振四溟。七千年過隙，九萬里揚舲。杲杲中天日，煌煌向曉星。承歡無别事，一卷福音經。］此種饒有詩意之境地，所謂樂善堂者，彷彿似之矣！</p>
<p>樂善堂者，九三叟馬相伯先生現寓之所；地址在徐家匯，與明徐文定公所遺勝跡，遥遥相望，若比鄰焉。距今六十年前，叟年逾三十，講學論道之餘，從事觀察天象。其後出仕高麗，奉使東灜，觀光北美，復游歐土，遄返父母之邦，問政興學，怱怱老！矣人生七十古來稀；鄉里且播爲美談。猶憶古羅馬名家季宰六所撰說老，中稱［年老而能寗靜純一，則亦必溫文而無所忤，如柏拉圖年八十一，至死猶秉筆著述。伊索克臘德斯年九十四，亦著書不息，其師爵吉亞百有七歲，猶孜孜誨人不倦云。］又憶吳稚暉先生壽樂善堂主人曰：［得天地厚，應壽一萬八千齡，才經過二倍百分之一；］可徵天之厚古人而亦不薄今人也。</p>
<p>申報凌博士，憲老乞言，曾記九三老人馬相伯語錄；今牽於事，囑余續之：爰紀所聞若干。若有錯誤，責在記者！</p>
<h3>祝自由談的［轉變］！</h3>
<p>— 養正</p>
<p>自由［談談］談談［自由］</p>
<p>［自由］兩字在未沾歐化而閉關時代的中國，當然不是訓作與［平等］一起的近代的［自由］；僅僅是帶了［隨便］的意思。望文生義，［自由談］三字就會被誤解爲［隨便談談］。於是極有價値的［副刋］往往因這誤解而遭人輕蔑了。近時許多報紙的［副刋］大半除吟風弄月的詞章外，便是談妖說怪的文字；每况愈下的，甚至於精蟲，生殖器，屁，尿，屎……都拿來供作重要的［題材］：因此，最不名譽的［報屁股］也成了它的［尊號］；這是［副刋］自身不愼［立言］而自取的侮辱！自由談在過去實在含有［隨便談談］的傾向；即近來除陶知行先生的不除庭草齋夫談薈和程瞻廬先生的二一枝譚具有生動深刻的筆調與［談言微中］的作風外，差不多隨時會發見只有文學價値而缺乏［寓褒貶，别善惡］意味的文章。這自然是已往［副刋］之［不談政治］的［超然］病；同時也是言論［不自由一的結果。一旦言論有了［自由］，［副刋］篇幅雖小又怎麽不可以談起國家大事來呢？由於不能［談］，所以［談］也［不自由］；最後索性［不談］！自由談就不得不偏重於［談談］方面去了。現在决計在九月一日起［轉變］，這種［革故更新］的［前進］是値得欽佩的！我竭誠希望自由談自［九一］的［轉變］以後能夠抱定不屈不撓的精神站在言論［自由］的立塲上爲中國人，乃至全人類的［解放］與［自由］的實現多說幾句話！我祝着：</p>
<p>［［九一］前，　　　［九一］後，</p>
<p>自由談；　　　　　　自由談；</p>
<p>自由談，　　　　　　自由談，</p>
<p>自由［談談］。　　　談談［自由］！］</p>
<h3>詩意的秋</h3>
<p>— 錢台生</p>
<p>誰管得了熱湯熱水？</p>
<p>秋凉了，風是吹人胸襟是那樣地凉快，感覺夏天的熱，便不得不感着秋的可人了。夏，是那樣熱，煩躁得要使人找汽水，找刨冰。旋轉的電扇在頭頂上旋，冷水汀的設備，把滿屋冰得凉凉的，那，還嫌着夏天的熱！</p>
<p>東三省，誰管得了？有槍有砲的還征服不了，誰還去管這閒事！誰都忘了的東三省，便用得着在那熱得發炸的天氣裏，去忙得滿身臭汗？</p>
<p>在東方熹微舞塲歸來，或是午夜睡眼惺忪是出了電影院，誰能在都市的肉的氛圍中，擺脫地抓出了東北的影子？</p>
<p>秋風來了，究竟是詩意的秋，樹葉蕭蕭，長風掃地，感着秋的凉快，炎熱的夏居然忘却！</p>
<p>一二八戰地情况，是正可大加鑒賞的時候，吳淞江畔，重登砲台，指點着，這是敵軍的投擲的炸彈的土坑，這是敵軍二十四隻兵艦圍攻砲台時所放砲彈的創痕，多麽驚奇的戰蹟呢？多麽濃厚的詩意呢，這秋天，這凉爽的秋天！</p>
<p>東北沉淪經年，而邊省熱河，敵軍又以重兵來襲，熱河，熱河，誰管得了這熱湯熱水？好在誰都能耐眼看着東北沉淪了經年，區區熱河，又會使誰提起精神來呢？</p>
<h3>啤酒中的蒼蠅</h3>
<p>— 綿綿</p>
<p>法國人心目中的中國人</p>
<p>日本人侮辱中國人，不必待我說。美國人在影片中侮辱中國人，也是人所共知的了。法國人呢，他們在現在的世界舞臺上與日本朋比爲奸，對於中國人自然也不懷好感。我們看了下面舉的一個例，便可知道此中的情形了。</p>
<p>在法國的書本中有這樣的一節記述，題目是［啤酒中的蒼蠅。］譯之如下：</p>
<p>［在酒館裏呌了一杯啤酒若發見了酒杯中有一個蒼蠅的時光，這顧客所取的態度，依國籍而異的。</p>
<p>西班牙人付了錢跑出店去。</p>
<p>法國人先把蒼蠅捉出來踏死，然後將店裏的人臭駡一頓。</p>
<p>英國人將啤酒潑在地上，高呼一聲。堂倌，再拿一杯來！馬上轉說别的話。</p>
<p>德國人將蒼蠅取出，再喝啤酒。</p>
<p>俄國人對於這些小事毫不介意，把蒼蠅和啤酒一塊兒呑下去。</p>
<p>最後，中國人怎樣呢。他先把蒼蠅像老吃客一般嚼嚼滋味，再慢慢地喝啤酒。］</p>
<p>有這荒謬絶倫的話麽？中國人自已怕也决沒有看到過這樣的中國人！會吃蒼蠅的中國人。我只知道日本倒有一個會吃毛虫吃蛇的人。這個日本人蒼蠅也一定會吃。可是我從未知道會吃蒼蠅的中國人。這並非替中國人爭面子，實在沒有這樣的人才的，該記述中的中國人决不是實際生存在世上的中國人。一定是法國人心目中的中國人吧。</p>
<p>這個記述只吿訴我們法國人所恨的是那幾國人，他們恨的是德國人俄國人中國人。丨對的，證之於現在法國對國際間的態度，不是很與這記述的態度暗中吻合的麽。</p>
<h3>醒後隨筆</h3>
<p>— 濟翔</p>
<p>新與舊兩性觀念性的罪惡</p>
<p>這個年頭，事情是什麽都矛盾，舊的是動摇了，崩潰了，但它的殘骸還到處遺留著；新的呢，待裝進去，又裝不進去，結果，只粘了一些些氣息。</p>
<p>舊的在排斥新的，新的在咒咀舊的，可憐，它們竟沒有握手的機會。</p>
<p>時代是像放大的纏過的小脚一樣，裏脚帶是抽了，鞋子是放大了，可是它的足指，仍是彎曲著，走起路來，一切都不自然，有時還得在鞋尖裏，塞上一大塊棉花呢。</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>兩性的觀念，總是這麽奇妙不可思議。</p>
<p>我相信，我的心地，是十分坦白，純潔，一點沒有甚麽猥褻的觀念，夾雜在裏面，但是，當我同一個女人講話時，我總不能不感覺到伊是一個女人，要是這女人漂亮一點的話，我還能感到一些輕微的陶醉，雖然我並不覺得。</p>
<p>朋友，你大槪也有這麽一個經騐吧。</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>關於性的罪惡，大槪總歸男人們負責，這似乎已是天經地義，無可非議。</p>
<p>然而，猩紅的嘴唇，雪白的面頰，如水的媚眼，惱人的香氣，緊窄的衣衫，肉色的絲襪，粉紅的褲管：這些，這些，隨處都在發射一種誘惑的力，結果，男人是追求了，犯罪了。</p>
<p>究竟是男人的不是呢，還是女人在欺惘男人？</p>

<h3>銀絲</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>這小鎭上已經過了兩個多月的整理，但是戰後的坵壚，還隨處可見到，雖然它在許多戰區中，受砲火是最少，受敵人的蹂躪也最輕。</p>
<p>但是余芬若女士的家，已被砲火所燬，伊的東西，除了逃出鎭上的時候所帶着的一個衣包之外，什麽也沒有了。本來伊除了自已孑然一身之外，旣沒有丈夫，又沒有子女，更沒有任何家人，戰後本來無須再住到這小鎭上來了；但是伊還掛念着伊隣居的一個瘋婦，伊的慈善心，驅迫伊來找尋這個可憐而爲全鎭可厭惡的一個女瘋子。居然被伊找到，便同住在一個屋子裏。</p>
<p>奇怪！這個瘋子住的屋子，只和余芬若隔着一個門面，却不會被敵人的砲火所轟掉，而左右的隣居，却已墻坍壁倒；這個瘋子並沒有逃，居然沒有死在槍彈和砲火之中。</p>
<p>這個瘋子，太可憐了，伊也只孑然一身，沒有什麽親戚家人也許伊有幾個親戚，但是伊在發瘋的時候，是使人十分討厭，所以沒有一個人願意和伊往來，雖然伊也有神經清楚的時候，不是完全在瘋的。只有余芬若可憐伊和伊要好，並且十分的照顧伊。</p>
<p>伊們的生活是狠可憐，余芬若在上海繡貨店裏取些繡件做着針黹過日子，瘋子在腦筋清楚的時候，提着一隻布籃子，給人縫補縫補。余芬若只知道伊姓袁，對於伊的身世，和怎樣會成瘋子，是一些也不知道；伊有時也問過袁瘋子，但是伊不曾明白地講過，只在伊瘋的時候，聽着伊的瘋話，意會出伊是一個被人遺棄的婦人。而余芬若的歷史，鎭上的人，也都不知道，只知道伊是一個嫞婦，因爲伊已是四十歲的婦人，也沒有歹人再去欺負伊，伊茹苦含辛地過着日子，而且帮助着年齡和伊相仿的袁瘋子過着一輩子的可憐生活。</p>
<p>這樣的婦人，在鄉鎭間是司空見慣，不足爲奇，所以並沒有人注意到伊們，但是有一位繡貨店［放生活］（把繡貨到工人家裏收發的呌做放生活）的老頭兒，狠看得起余芬若，知道伊常常帮助袁瘋子。這位放生活的人，呌做王先生。</p>

<p>銀公司進近期</p>
<p>昨英銀雖升、但市况反疲、美銀勿動、是以本埠市面未有若何影響、趨勢似好、匯豐掛牌、英印和港均無榮辱、惟美金長一二五、係匯兌又漲半分至六二五故也、法印加二元、德坡均加二五、殆内盤初平後挺復鬆、旋又見佳、終則平平、結果較隔昨、計英金縮Ｏ六二五、美匯縮一二五、可謂明放暗佳之勢、而金價因之復漲四兩、華商交易不鮮、計英金數萬鎊、沙遜洋行續購來年一月期、至美金約有五六十元、各金號扒過於塞、匯豐有所售出、銀公司略進近期、華銀行如上海賣意不怠、中央則出現期、或套掉現金、下午因逢週三停市、</p>

<h3>月底銀洋市非常繁暢</h3>
<p>▲市場交易固繁收解尤盛　昨日因値大月底、銀錢業銀洋收解非常鼎盛、除原有例應理者外、對於結欵亦殊孔多、故形勢甚爲忙碌、至於市場中之銀洋交易狀况、洋交易亦甚緊暢、銀拆票亦較平時略多、不過市價方面洋厘早市略俏午市仍軟、銀根則依然軟化耳、</p>
<p>▲洋厘早漲午跌銀拆仍弱　［洋厘］早市洋交甚旺、人心大好、故厘價遽又越出九厘外、爲六錢八分九厘二毫半、午市依舊回落、與前日價復同爲六錢八分八厘八毫七怱半、形勢較前日略優、［銀拆］因頭　充裕、銀行又有出倉、故銀拆益見回弱、早午兩市同爲四分、較前日小去一分、劃頭始終無加水、槪行白劃、</p>
<p>▲輔幣中銅元許久無上落　江南小洋較前日略高一厘、計爲五錢九分六厘、早午兩市又無羞異、交易早市七千五百角、午市三千五百角、廣東小洋、早市似好七毫半、爲五錢八分二厘七毫半、午市又跌爲五錢八分二厘、交易早市十五萬五千角、午市四萬角、銅元屹然不動、計爲四百三十三千文、交易五萬五千四百餘串、計銀欵一萬二千八百兩、</p>
<p>▲銀收解因月底大忙特忙　昨日銀行收解甚爲忙碌、華商收解票欵竟有四百餘萬之多、外商收解票欵亦有四百萬光景、至於結欵收解更多、華洋各銀行共有七八百萬、押欵交易一百九十餘萬、各種貨匯稅雜押特諸欵收解一千六百餘萬、出倉一百四十萬、錢莊銀公單收解三千四餘萬、劃頭欵收解五百四十餘萬、各路滙欵收解一百十餘萬、收現一百餘萬、</p>

<h3>上月份銀拆總計額</h3>
<p>上月份銀根鬆滯、達於極點、然上旬　尙有一錢外銀拆市價、後即跌入一錢關内、直至月底、從未越出一錢範圍以外、故全月統計銀拆總額、以三十一天中共祇二兩二錢三分、每天僅扯七分Ｏ三毫餘雖今年（除上半年二三月外）未有最高銀拆之見聞、而觀其目前現狀、確難有轉機希望、大槪此次常會開議、存息案總在二兩及二兩半之間、尙不及欠息坐盤之底碼、一般存欠二方之供求用戶、個中拆耗、自不待言云、</p>
<h3>證劵債市仍極寥落</h3>
<p>十月期無市價均趨疲</p>
<p>昨（卅一日）華商證劵交易所各債市况、現貨祇後市有數種開出、成交八千二百元、内久無交易之十九年關稅公債、怱成交一千元、期市亦寥落如前、市場人氣、非常冷淡、十月期雖照常開拍、仍無成交、九月期全日共做開一百七十六萬五千元、環象沉悶、人心觀望、而零戶求售尙多、買進稀少、故價比交割前、一致下跌、内　裁兵現貨比上星期跌一元半、餘各小四五角至七八角不等、觀債市形勢、似未可樂觀、暫時或須盤旋續疲云、</p>

<h3>糧食米市趨勢轉穩</h3>
<p>▲滬南　昨日西路來源較前略多、約抵三二餘號、而浦存宿次仍屬　塞、城鄉店胃不佳、厚粳行情新鮮又增角外、薄稻客帮略動、開盤定局、同里河灘尖到數十石、米品尙佳、行盤約九元五角左右、</p>
<p>▲新閘　米市昨到念　號、本街交易、因天雨有限、北粳頂緊、中關見鬆、　早二稻無榮辱、糯米需要尙好、價漲近角、新粳新客尖坐定之勢、</p>
<h3>湘米源到埠</h3>
<p>續小五分今明可到千餘包</p>
<p>昨日米市更見無神、因客胃呆木、湘米續到、人心向下、市價步小、昨市内地帮辦去湘米百餘包、其他盡爲本街應酬、湘米較前市又小五分、因報載湘米有大批來申、數有一萬餘包、市面更受影鄉、但招商之江大輪今明可以到埠、所裝湘米只有一千餘包、餘數以申市不振、多爲退裝以待機會、全市祇開機靖米三百廿包、價八元八角半至八元八角、砶米貨主尙喊八元四五角、面吃戶祗還八元一二角、致難成議、西貢米市上開出二百包、價祗九元三角九分、小絞米四百包、價九元Ｏ五分至八元九角半、均爲本街收去、</p>
<h3>八月份麵粉交割祇三千包</h3>
<p>昨爲八月份粉交割、全日交割數量、甚爲零星、因大　家方面、事前均自行軋去、或臨時爲客帮抽去、故祇有零星未了之成交、實際履行、計華豐廠交割綠麥根二千包、泰隆之回籠綠　球一千包、餘則一無所有、至洋麥報價昨已回小二三四角左右、故出月開價、恐將又趨跌勢云、</p>
<h3>八月期麥交割七十八車</h3>
<p>八月份標準小麥、昨日已完全交割清楚、總數計七十八車、（按事前尙有卅七車爲申大廠抽去）、交出者計鼎泰五車、愼昌廿六車、潤德十一車、仁成十八車、義興十三車、八號廿八號各二車、廿五號一車、收進者均爲泰潤、聞此項貨品、大半仍係廠家取去云、</p>
<h3>南北貨生晒圓肉首批已到</h3>
<p>同安漳州所產生晒桂圓肉、茲値新貨豋場、昨據號方消息、首批業已到申、統共不上十件、其中碼生晒圓肉僅三數件、餘爲同安元肉、大約今日可以見樓開盤云、</p>
<p>前日又運到七百餘件</p>
<p>歐美絲銷暢達、乾繭消費激增、滬埠存繭不充、内地乾繭類均陸續運滬、乘機善價求售、是以皖墨新乾繭運滬不弱、前日各江輪、又由蕪湖大通兩埠裝到皖乾繭七百四十八件云、</p>
<h3>期絲電報續有發出</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊絲市、續呈堅俏、查歐美各莊黃白灰各絲經電報、昨晨續有發出、進胃未衰、市氣堅挺、昨由連納愼餘等進中身Ｂ級十三至十五條份滬白廠經六十包、價自六百兩至六百三十兩、乾利怡和等進鐵機十三至十五條份川黃廠經六十包、價自五百八十五兩至六百六十兩</p>
<h3>茶市轉趨沉靜</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、轉趨沉靜、英莊行家、均以日來英國銀價、逐步提漲、而華商對於市盤、又不願放鬆、是以多持觀望態度、交易頓趨寥落、昨日全市僅祇針眉秀眉及低莊貢熙等項、略有交易、珍眉珠茶等花色、因價値鉅大、市面幾於完全停頓云、</p>
<h3>五金純銻洋莊有活動望</h3>
<p>五金市情、近仍混沌、各貨交易、條旺倐衰、其趨勢難於捉摸、亦爲業中人所不能預料、總之在此混沌之時局、向有混沌之市面、殊不能以正當市面觀之也、</p>
<p>▲湖南純銻靜極思動　純銻爲我國之特產品、其銷于東瀛西歐以及花旗坎拿大等邦、爲數可觀、惟自蘇俄發現銻礦之後、西歐銷路頓告斷絶、近市所賴以點綴者、日美諸邦而已、惟以實銷不起、購辦不多、致申市仍歸冷落、最近問津者、已絡繹於途、市象已有靜極思動之槪、行情每噸爲一百九十五兩、比前亦好起十餘兩云、</p>
<p>▲本廠元釘出口甚廣　本廠元釘自跌價後、出路銳進、惟苦于成交躉鮮零　、致市情熱鬧、青島長江福建粤汕諸帮昨均有辦去、行情每桶爲六兩倍司（稅餉在内）、而本街開出價爲五兩四錢、聞成出價達五六百桶之多、後之求交者、仍大有人在也、</p>
<p>▲點錫市在尶尬局面中　點錫交易、近多零星、大宗買賣、自紹興帮存觀望後、全市大感落冷、行情因之難于進展、雖海外定價高于申地、但全市在尷尬之局而中、一無發展之能力、因此市情殊爲閑散、聞昨日雖開出二三百担、其價小硔爲八十五兩、荷蘭九十二兩、雜錫八十六七兩之譜、鈎光四十八兩云、</p>
<p>▲烟皮鐵昨開五百餘担　昨日秋雨滂沱、連綿不息、致五金交易大爲减色、惟久無問津之烟皮鐵、昨日由天津帮開去五百六七十担、價每担爲八兩五錢、比前已覺好起數錢、惟調查此貨存底、甚爲單薄、所以人心良佳、後市標準大有繼續看好之希望云、</p>
<h3>煤炭煤交清淡魯貨略跌</h3>
<p>昨日天雨、又値月底結賬、是以市塲交易異常清淡、統計全市成交不滿千噸、而魯產之各貨行情、遂有跌落錢數、如做開之小山統八十噸、跌一錢五分、西河統五十噸、跌一錢、</p>

<p>我在八月三日，廢止内戰的談言中，早已言之，我國地大物博，而有領袖欲的人太多，其惟一的希望，現在的軍政長官，減少其領袖欲，先要脚踏實地，就近做去，我能力足以統一一省者，先以一省整理之，我能力足以統一數省者，我先以數省整理之，得寸則寸，從頭做去，自會有統一的一日。</p>
<p>前日汪精衛先生，在中央黨部紀念週演說熱河問題，與共赴國難之方法，以建設來求統一，以均權來求共治，亦是此意，不過所不同的一點，我建設這個主張，是因廢止内戰而發，而汪先生表示這個主張，是爲共赴國難而發，若廢止内戰，這種主張，原是對病良藥，若共赴國難，發表這個主張，所謂［急驚風遇着慢郎中，］眞是有鞭長不及馬腹之勢呢。</p>
<p>汪先生三個辦法，第一能夠統一的各省，應替他們解决種種困難，極力整頓，建設起來，使人民得到安居樂業，在這幾省　樹立起近代政治的榜樣來，第二名義上服從中央，而實際上不完全一致的各省，應該打算建設來求統一，第三民衆組織起來，這是平時整理内政的方法，都不似共赴國難的方法，因爲這種辦法，决非一年二年所能奏效，遠水救不着近火。</p>
<p>現在國難當前，猶如燃眉之急，若再要從容暇裕，整理内部，則國難已成，再無挽救的希望，故我的主張，祇有［寗爲玉碎不爲瓦全］就是汪先生所謂［苟有一槍一彈，必要誓死抵抗，］無論如何犧牲，必使敵人破鈔相當的代價，我國苟有這樣的軍隊，我人民無不惟力是視，竭力援助·馬占山，第十九路軍，第五軍，是其例　。</p>

<p>— 逸僧</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>悉煞秋風秋雨天，可憐黑水白山前，胡兒復國先亡國，堅子防邊竟棄邊，義卒艱難匡復志，中朝抵抗口頭禪，漫言邦難尋常事，高龍臺灣未幾年，</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>忽傳將相起支吾，色變風雲南北都，意氣拚爭當外侮，鈞衡無法失中樞，黎元東省淪新國，匪赤中原負舊隅，如此江山如此夜，奈何更惜好頭顱，</p>

<h3>松葉造棉法</h3>
<p>— 江天覽</p>
<p>人造棉花，吾人只知利用稻草，而不知松葉亦爲造棉的唯一原料，且松葉較稻草價賤，造成棉後，獲利更鉅，凡關心工業的，對於松葉造棉，不妨研究一下，</p>
<p>但鄙人所知的松葉造棉法，係採取老而堅的松葉，於日中曝燥，隨浸於攝氏六十度之熱水中，約六個小時取出，以水一千烈脫，加酒精一烈脫，酵母一烈脫之五分之一，拌攪使和，取有小孔若干的木板，下面墊簀，上面加石，將松葉壓沈，不使其浮於水面，</p>
<p>缸蓋上要有孔，以便流通空氣，於是缸内漸起發醇，自增其熱度，但浸漬久暫，則視天氣寒煖而定，大槪兩星期，即可發泡，俟發酵已達適當程度，可將缸底木塞拔去，放去浸出的鹻性的水，倘葉中尙有不溶於水的膠油，當加下稀薄的鉀輕養液，一起拌攪，導入蒸汽，膠油自解，隨水流出，更加水和蒸汽洗滌數回，然後使其得適宜之乾燥，</p>
<p>此時若尙有皮不能脫盡，可放入圓篩中，迅速旋轉，分離其皮，於是施以最後手續，令其柔軟，置臼中或平板上，覆以粗布，用棒叩擊，再揉細篩之，所得的纎維質，即爲純粹的棉花，其篩出的屑，燃燒之後，可製成一種松烟，</p>
<p>此法鄙人不過就所知籠統說一下，備作試騐之用，世上不乏發明家，當有比此法更詳的，書以敎我，</p>

<h3>中下級的殯儀館應設問題</h3>
<p>— 宗白</p>
<p>婚喪喜慶的事是個個都有的，但是社會上到底是中下級的人居多數，中級人的住宅，平日都是僅僅可用，或者是兩家一舍，或是三家一舍，下級人更不足說，什麽灶披間，什麽三層擱，都住滿一舍幾口，碰着做喜慶的事，就可以去借用酒樓旅館，中級也有中級的，下級也有下級的，這不必說，</p>
<p>但碰着做喪事，那就發生大問題，遇着你有了一個將要死的人，二房東不肯讓你在屋裏死去，同住的人們也厭惡的，送到醫院裏去，醫生說沒有法子來救命醫院是不能收留的，那時眞個是走頭無路，祗可讓他死在馬路中，還不知去抓一塊什麽地方來收殮屍首來做做喪事，你道中下級人這時候苦不苦呢？，莫道下級人，就算是中級的，能夠死在家裏，一間單幢房子，辦起了喪事，客堂間擺了屍首，就沒有地方招待那吊孝的親戚朋友，勢不得不利用那屋外的弄堂，架起了竹棚，擺了幾張不倫不類的桌子椅子，來招待他們坐坐，這都是無法可想，碰着天氣熱，太陽一百幾十度，竹棚下都不可坐的，碰着天氣冷，兩面通風，又是不能坐的，所以我認爲中下級的儀殯館應該要辦的，</p>
<p>上海膠州路是有一間煌煌大厦的萬國殯儀館，但是祗可讓那上流階級的亨受，什麽玻璃棺材，怎樣藏製屍首，種種的用費，動一動手就非一千幾百兩辦不到的，下級更談不要談，中級的也是望洋興嘆罷了，所以中下級的儀殯館，是應該早的籌辦，大家可以倣着萬國殯儀館的辦法，當作是營業機關，上海地方這樣的大，人口這麽的多，三五間也可以容納的，或者許多人以爲做上等的，那可以多拿些利益，但是社會上中下</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>級的人居多數，你拿薄利多，買主義去做，又豈不是一件好好的生易經嗎？况且這種館子，本錢不用多，祗要租一座房子，小的好比雙幢房子的大，大些的或者三上三下的大小，用着一兩個職員，不要粉飾太過輝煌，賺錢方面是計算喪家租借的房租，同代辦棺材代呌儀仗種種的事情，取回一個公道的回佣，何嘗不是好好的生易經，這個事業輕而易舉，有益社會的民生狠大、大家怎麽不去試辦一間呢？（却酬）</p>

<h3>失望地歸來</h3>
<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>在這鬧着百業凋敝經濟恐慌的社會裏，那一羣羣的人們都是徘徊在十字街頭，拿着他們的生命在掙扎，他們想找個職來謀生，可是［粥少僧多］的影子，老是在你的眼簾前閃耀，可有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>黃君總算僥倖的踏進了ＸＸ文化機關，充個小小的書記職務，照我所曉得的，他每月薪水拿三十元，膳宿自備，幷且要擔負他的家庭一切，家裏有妻子，有滿了三足月的孩兒和年逾半百的慈母，而且都是不能生產者，以那樣的收入，維持這樣的家庭，生活難於安定，自是一個狠明顯的事實，</p>
<p>爲了生活重重的壓迫，眼看他的身體一天天的比較瘦弱下來，環境的惡劣，於是便影響到他的意志薄弱，他覺得此後的一切，似乎都是飄蕩在五里霧中，眼前望見一羣的猙獰的面目向他含有惡意的譏剌，但是他想不出什麽法子去應付它們，有法子但也拿不出勇氣去做，一天的早晨，黃君翻閱報紙廣吿，無意識地忽然看見一只打字學堂的廣吿，學費如何的低廉，學成如何的有用，……黃君心靈一動，向着報紙微笑，結果典質了一件羊皮袍子，到ＸＸ打字學堂報名，因爲想多得到一種能對於生活上有帮助的技能，</p>
<p>那一間小洋房式的亭子樓中，把着四部打字機器和一盞電燈，也就是學校全部的財產，迎面來了一個西裝楚楚的敎師，開始向黃君攀談起來，</p>
<p>［先生是來學打字的嗎？呃，尊姓？］敎師抬頭就這樣問，</p>
<p>［是來學打字的，我呌黃百曼，請問先生貴姓，貴校長是那一位？］</p>
<p>［敝姓朱，本校就是我經辦的，現在鄙人要同黃先生簡略一談，本校學程分三班速成，特别，普通，速成課一月可畢業，特别兩月，普通三月，一經練習，即能閉目按打，每屆本校畢業同學，都介紹進公司銀行…………薪水都蠻大，黃先生志願加入那一班？］朱校長眉開眼笑的問，</p>
<p>［速成班！］黃君脫口而出，他心裏暗暗地想，雖然校舍只有一間亭子間，從剛剛朱校長所談，在社會上的成績倒狠不錯，幷且介紹的同學，薪水據說蠻大，這時黃君頭腦裏只有充滿着大有希望的四個字，</p>
<p>［那末，請先付報名費吧！兩只洋，明日就可來校，再繳學費十三元，紙張用品費兩元，報名費在學費内扣除，如不來恕不退還，時間可聽尊便，上午九時至晩上九時止。］朱校長好像現出一種遷就學生的一付神容，</p>
<p>三天之後，黃君的學費早已被朱校長逼得要命，在打習的時候，朱校長竟白眼相敎，於是黃君用了九朱二虎之力，而把學費勉强繳足了，在他想若是不爽爽快快繳齊，定被朱校長看清他是個窮光蛋，畢竟要得到偌大的障礙，還不如早點討好，可是事實却是格格相反，在付清學費之後，這位朱校長老是躱在太太的房裏，大唱其［妹妹！……］的情調，好像黃君買了票子來聽戲一般的唱得十分起勁，對於打習的方法等等，不加以指導，倒是將到鐘點的時光，朱校長拖着輕飄的皮鞋來敎室裏預備着息燈，</p>
<p>畢業期是到了，朱校長照例的發給各位學生所謂一張畢業文憑，自然黃君也蒙其恩賜，</p>
<p>［黃百曼，一有機會，即行通知好了，再會再會！］</p>
<p>［……………］</p>
<p>歸途上，黃君長嘆了一聲，不但速之無成，一張書店裏化五分錢即可買獲的現成畢業文憑，拿來究有何用？何况還要自已塡上一元的印花？生活上帮助的期望，還在白雲深深處，</p>
<p>社會的一角</p>
<h3>三官生日</h3>
<p>— 月蟾</p>
<p>［黃家嫂嫂，今朝阿是陰曆七月念七三官生日（音逆）］，一個中年婦人，對他的同居，一個抱着小孩的少年婦人這樣說着，</p>
<p>［不錯，我倒忘記了，我想要去買一只脚桶，因爲舊年三官生日買的那一只，已經爛得像豆腐一樣，吳家伯母儂阿要買點啥？］黃家嫂嫂含着微笑的這樣說，［諾！我那碗櫉壞了，本想正月念七去買的，（一年有三次是正月念七，七月念七，十月念七，三次）那知因爲打仗不擺了，想今天去買多少可以便宜些，所以等到現在，走吧！］素來性急的吳家伯母又是故態復萌的催着，</p>
<p>［喔唷！爲啥這樣性急，謝謝儂，阿好等一等，］</p>
<p>［那末快點］……</p>
<p>不多一刻，果然吳家伯母，和黃家嫂嫂並領着她四歲的孩子三囡，出了石庫門，徑向陸家浜路走去，</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>素來冷僻的南市陸家浜路，這幾天小販們都來趕生意，所以漸行熱鬧起來，什麽買傢具呀，絲襪啦，竹器藤器啦，都是些一年中買不掉的次貨，他們用着不同的招徠顧客法，有摇鈴的，有用他出售貨敲擊着，也有提着他的喉嚨高聲喊呌的，還有西洋鏡變把戲，鼕鼕鐺鐺的敲着鑼鼓引誘人們，一片嘈雜很是熱鬧，</p>
<p>［姆媽！我要看西洋鏡，］三囡提出這條件，懇求他的母親！黃家嫂嫂，</p>
<p>［不許，沒有多帶錢，［她擺出做母親架子，說不許看的理由，</p>
<p>三囡知道今天出來的興趣絶望了，只得很着由好們走，</p>
<p>畢竟人心是不知足的，尤其是婦人家，買了這樣又要買那樣，就是家裏有的也要再買，她倆只貪價錢便宜不問物質的好壞，一共買了十幾樣，弄得四隻手拿不了，祇得呌黃包車，車價一角兩角的竹槓由他敲，回到家中，仔細一想，實在毫無便宜，反而多出了三四角的車錢，想想眞是不値得，</p>
<p>唉！</p>
<h3>戀愛和麫包</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>天光還沒有亮，整個的Ｎ鄉沉醉在甜蜜的夢中，通碼頭的石橋邊突然轉出兩個模糊的人影，很快的向前奔去，似乎負着什麽重大的使命，開往上海去的船停挿在碼頭旁，好像祇等他們函個，一上船後，就啓行了，船裏點着一盞昏暗的油燈，分辨他們是一男一女，他們面色紅潤，胸部還起伏不定，佔據了船艙的一角，他們相與一笑，彼此依靠着沉沉睡去，</p>
<p>這一天的正午，Ｎ鄉喧鬧着某鄉紳的女兒和雜貨店裏的兒子淫奔的事件；但是他們倆說自由戀愛得了勝利，安抵上海，</p>
<p>在愛河裏的同志，當然體會這是人生過程中最難以描寫的刹那，他們在都市的大旅社中，跳舞塲中：：一切罪惡之區，過着浪漫，肉慾的生活，但是這消金窟裏一會兒，使他們倆偷出來的錢已將化用殆盡，這時候他們才知道戀愛和麵包一樣重要，從大旅社搬進了亭子間，從狂歡的生活而去看闊朋友的嘴臉，錢祇會去不會來，他們稍稍感到失望，偶然在分欄廣吿中看見三十元一月的書記職位，鄭重的提起他起的筆，初次端正的寫上幾行正楷，附了詳細的地址，抱了極度希望把它寄了出去，當夜他們以爲已找着了新生活，很［悽慘］（言不豐盛）的備了下酒的東西，鼓勵以前的失望，慶祝未來的成功，他們比較愉快的過了這樣一個晩上，</p>
<p>清晨起來，從下一天起，盼望前送的覆信，但是一天，兩天……直到付不出第二個月房租時候，再度失望後，他們知道麵包比戀愛更重要，一方面典質度日，一方面一悉莫展，在報上儘量找機會，給他發現了某書局出版無名作家專號徵稿，他以爲還是從這方面努力吧，他從前在校裏讀書時候，担任過校刋的編輯，他很喜歡的吿訴她這個意思，當晩動筆作了一萬字的稿子，第二天的太陽降臨，他還不覺得疲乏，</p>
<p>無名作家專號終於盼望到出版之期，化五毛大洋購來一看，儘是些海上第一流作家的東西，末後有一篇徵求來的稿子，編輯後話上說篇幅有限，不能多載，並且希望無名作家繼續努力，我們的刋物是絶對公開的，</p>
<p>他把書撕得粉碎，想起她說到同學家裏去借錢，已三夜沒有歸來，他長嘆一聲，［人生爲的麵包，並不需要戀愛］</p>

<h3>Re-discussing the Northeast Problem and the US-Japan Relationship</h3>
<p>Hua</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident last year, the United States has made three formal representations regarding the Sino-Japanese issue. The first was a memorandum from the Secretary of State to the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi. The second was a memorandum issued on October 5th. The third was a note sent to both China and Japan on January 7th of this year. Since then, formal diplomatic documents between the United States and Japan regarding the Northeast Incident have ceased. Only the informal remarks of Secretary of State Stimson have been used to express the attitude of the United States. On February 25th, Stimson publicly released a long letter to Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The letter reiterated the main points of previous formal representations, detailing the US policy of Open Door and Equal Opportunity towards China, and denouncing Japan's violation of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. At that time, the 19th Route Army and the Fifth Army were actively resisting Japan in Shanghai, so its public release attracted the attention of various countries around the world, while Japan strongly opposed it, saying that it fueled China's anti-Japanese sentiment. On August 8th, Stimson again gave a speech at the New York Council on Foreign Relations, supporting the Kellogg-Briand Pact and implicitly criticizing Japan's atrocities in Northeast China. The Japanese people were outraged, and some even advocated questioning the United States. Recently, Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida made a series of radical statements in the provisional Diet, preparing to recognize the puppet regime, but the United States remained silent and made no response. Could it be that the United States is also a "silver-like wax spearhead," only good for show? Or does the US government know that the Japanese militarists are like madmen and cannot be reasoned with, and are planning to deal with them in another way? This question is of great importance to the future situation in East Asia. I would like to discuss it further based on my limited knowledge.</p>
<p>Based on past situations, the US government seems to have realized that the Northeast problem cannot be solved by words alone. Therefore, since January 7th of this year, Stimson has no longer made any formal diplomatic representations or negotiations with Japan regarding the Northeast problem. He only expressed the US government's position and attitude on this issue in letters and speeches. His expression was not a vain hope that the Japanese militarists would pull back from the brink and return to normal. Rather, it was a cry for help to the great powers, hoping to find allies to prepare for a joint response to Japan. This is because modern warfare involves a wide range of activities and large sacrifices. Every gain and loss is related to the rise and fall of national fortune, which is of great importance. Without allies, it is not possible to act rashly. Japan and France are somewhat close, while the United States stands in isolation. The United States must assess the situation and make preparations diplomatically before taking action. Therefore, it has to take a wait-and-see attitude for the time being.</p>
<p>However, it is not easy for the United States to find allies who can cooperate with it at present. In the past, during the era of the purely Labour Party cabinet in Britain, Prime Minister MacDonald adopted a pro-American policy. However, the situation has changed now that the National Government is in power. Europe is facing many problems, and it may not be easy to get Britain to help the United States resist Japan. Recently, there have been calls in the United States for the resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia. The ideologies of Russia and the United States are fundamentally different. The fact that there are such calls now shows that the United States seems to be seeking a second-best option because it cannot find allies with common interests and who can share its troubles. The United States is still hesitant and has not taken any strong action against Japan. The main reason may be this.</p>
<p>Some say, "Why doesn't the United States fight Japan alone if it has no allies?" The answer is, from a military point of view, the US naval base in the Far East is insufficient. The Philippines is not a naval base, and the military facilities on Guam have not yet been completed. A rash war would risk losing the existing islands in the Pacific. Although the US Air Force is superior to Japan's, Japan's ability to sustain a war is not as good as the United States'. However, if the US Navy lacks a chance of victory, the United States and Japan are too far apart, and the Air Force would also find it difficult to exert its great power. Secondly, from an economic point of view, Japan ranks second in US imports and fifth in US exports. The commercial and economic relations between the two countries are extremely close. If a protracted war breaks out, the United States, even if it has a chance of victory, would not only completely sacrifice its trade with Japan, but also face a long-term struggle and unpredictable changes. This is also something that the United States cannot ignore. Therefore, for these two reasons, the United States is unlikely to take any active action against Japan before it finds allies. In November of this year, the United States will hold presidential elections. If Hoover is re-elected, he may take active action against Japan as soon as he finds allies. Otherwise, he will wait until he leaves office on March 4th next year and let the next president take charge of everything. Therefore, from all aspects of observation and speculation, although a conflict between the United States and Japan is bound to occur in the future, it may not happen very soon.</p>
<p>The Japanese are bound to be well aware of the above situation. Therefore, we predict that Japan's aggression against us will become more and more intense in the near future. At this time, there is nothing more difficult for the people of the country than to grit their teeth, embrace the spirit of great fearlessness and great sacrifice, and pledge to resist to the end with our own efforts. As long as there is a breath left, this will should not be relaxed in the slightest. Recently, we received news from Beijing that if Japan actually recognizes the puppet regime, the central government will definitely issue an order to suppress it. If this news is true, it will be a ray of dawn for the future. We firmly believe that although our country is currently in a very difficult situation of international isolation and lack of assistance, if we can rise up and deal with Japan with our utmost efforts, the international situation will definitely change. Not only will the United States provide considerable assistance, but also Russia, which has not yet resumed diplomatic relations, will sympathize with us and will not side with imperialist Japan. Our country will not find it difficult to be in a favorable position from all sides and get rid of the predicament of isolation. If we concentrate our forces and unite against Japan, we will have the best allies in the world, those who uphold international law, treaties, and all guarantees of peace.</p>

<h3>Russian Troops More Active on the Border of the Eastern Provinces</h3>

<h3>The Military Committee's Beiping Branch Increases the Number of Committee Members</h3>

<p>(Beiping) The members of the Military Committee's Beiping Branch held a meeting at the Shuncheng Wangfu last night and resolved to increase the number of committee members.

<h3>The Forbidden City Stops Selling Antiques</h3>
<p>The Inspection Committee Holds a Meeting to Decide</p>
<p>Yi Peiji Arrives in Beijing to Explain Everything</p>
<p>(Beiping) The inspection committee of the Forbidden City, appointed by the Political Committee, held a meeting this morning. Wang Shuchang presided over the meeting, and Yi Peiji represented Yu Xingchu. A committee member questioned the private sale of goldware from the Forbidden City. Yu replied that the goldware sold so far has been sold for 310,000 yuan. The sale was decided by the board of directors and approved by the central government. Both the Beiping and Tianjin authorities knew about this matter. Yu Xuezhong and Wang Shuchang both said that they did not know about it beforehand. It was decided to order the Forbidden City to: (1) immediately stop selling all antiques from now on, (2) submit the list of directors and meeting minutes to the central government, and all telegrams and sales accounts to the Political Committee, and (3) immediately go to the Forbidden City for inspection. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yi Peiji, who was accused of stealing antiques from the Beiping Palace Museum, arrived in Beijing from Beiping on the 31st and went to the Central Party Headquarters.

(31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yi Peiji told visitors that there are reports and records of the inspection of the antiques in the Forbidden City, and there is no shortage at all. This time, due to the unstable situation, the important items were selected and moved into the warehouse for safekeeping, which led to misunderstandings from the outside world. In fact, the Forbidden City has extremely strict security, and the custodians are mostly academic experts. The rumors from the outside world are absolutely impossible in reality. He came here to report various situations and discuss safe storage methods. As for how to handle it in the future, he will listen to the central government's instructions. (31st Dispatch)</p>

The procedure for requesting exemption is the same as in the previous item. (5) For those exempted, reduced, or deferred from Ding Cao land tax, other related taxes and levies will be handled in the same manner as the land tax.

The government plans to respond to the Indian government with retaliatory tariffs during the tariff revision period next March."</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 31st - Rodier, head of the India Department of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, said today that the result of the Lancashire cotton industry strike may lose the benefit of India increasing import taxes on non-British cotton cloth. Rodier told news reporters that two weeks before the strike in Lancashire, the Indian market was very active and there were many inquiries about prices, and the atmosphere was excellent. Now there are inquiries about the conditions for resolving the strike, which is very detrimental to ordering goods.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 31st - The two sides in the Lancashire cotton industry dispute have not yet approached each other. The Employers' Association met in Manchester today. Although no announcement was issued when the meeting adjourned, it is heard that the employers decided to maintain their current wait-and-see attitude. The Central Committee of the Weavers' Union also held a meeting today. After the meeting, the union secretary stated that the Central Committee, after receiving reports from various districts, expressed deep gratitude for the response of the strikers. Although the number of strikers has increased today, most of the cloth factories in South Lancashire have not stopped work.</p>
<h3>German Social Democrat Elected Speaker of Parliament</h3>
<p>Prior Agreement Reached with the Center Party Through Negotiations</p>
<p>Unexpectedly Quiet Opening Day</p>
<p>▲Berlin, National News Agency, 30th – The new parliament opened at 3 PM today. Ms. Sittkin, the eldest member of parliament from the Communist Party, presided over the session, and it proceeded peacefully, which was quite unexpected. A crowd gathered near the parliament building in the early morning to observe the arrival of the parliamentarians. Although there were no disturbances, the police began clearing the streets, forcing the onlookers to stand at a distance. Ms. Sittkin entered the parliament building through a side door sometime in the morning to avoid being swarmed by reporters, photographers, and filmmakers who were waiting for her. Members of the National Socialist Party, dressed in brown party uniforms with swastika armbands, arrived successively and quietly took their seats. Communist Party members entered shouting various slogans like "Red Front." After three bell rings, Ms. Sittkin, supported by two other female Communist members, ascended to the speaker's seat. Surprisingly, the 230 members of the National Socialist Party, who nearly constituted half of the entire assembly, did not obstruct the proceedings. Even though the speaker's opening remarks contained some provocative language, they remained unmoved, evidently following the orders of their party leader. During the speaker's address, the National Socialist members sat silently, while the National People's Party members left the chamber together, only to return when it came time to vote. The speaker's speech was met with cheers from the Communist members, but was otherwise received coldly. Subsequently, it was decided to elect the executive officers, a move that deviated from German parliamentary practice and was also quite astonishing. Its purpose was evidently to use the speaker to pressure the president, avoiding the dissolution or suspension of the parliament. Subsequently, National Socialist member Göring was elected speaker with 307 votes. Only the Social Democrats and the Communists did not vote for him. This demonstrates that the National Socialists and the Catholic Center Party had reached an agreement on this matter beforehand, but it does not necessarily prove that the two parties had also compromised on forming a new coalition government. The two deputy speakers, Graf from the National People's Party and Rochus from the Bavarian People's Party, were elected with the same majority. Then, the new speaker, Göring, took the stage and delivered a concise and sharp speech, refuting rumors that the parliament would be excluded and not allowed to participate in state affairs. He also requested the entire assembly to authorize him to send a telegram to the president, urging him to receive the parliament officials to hear their report on the political situation. He continued, "I solemnly declare before the entire German nation that today's meeting, especially the election of the executive officers, has fully demonstrated that the new parliament has a harmonious working majority. Therefore, there is no reason to dissolve it due to urgent national issues." After the entire assembly granted the speaker the necessary power to handle this matter, the session was adjourned, with the date of the next meeting to be decided by the speaker.</p>
<p>▲Berlin, Reuters, 30th – The new speaker, Göring, is an army captain and a key figure in the Nazi Party. He commanded an air squadron during the European War. The temporary speaker, Sittkin, is a 75-year-old woman and a Communist Party member known as the "grandmother of the revolution." In her opening remarks, Sittkin demanded the impeachment of President Hindenburg and his cabinet for violating the constitution. Sittkin denounced the current cabinet as tools of capitalists and large landowners. Because of being the oldest member of the parliament, Sittkin was chosen as the temporary speaker to conduct the opening ceremony. The National Socialists had opposed Sittkin's appointment as speaker in the past few weeks, but yesterday Hitler decided that the party members must act in an orderly manner to set an example for the nation, and, especially when the parliament is struggling with von Papen, not give von Papen an excuse to implement the president's order to resolve the parliament. Therefore, Sittkin was able to become the temporary speaker. After the president's address was read, the parliament adjourned until next week, so that members of the Center Party could attend the Catholic Congress. It is widely expected that the parliament will be dissolved, but the dissolution order has not yet been issued.</p>
<h3>President Signs Dissolution Order</h3>
<p>Authorizes von Papen to Fully Handle the Situation</p>
<p>Temporarily Postpones Meeting with Representatives of the New Parliament</p>
<p>▲Berlin, Havas Agency, 30th – The circumstances of this session of the German parliament are unprecedented in the history of parliaments in any country. When von Papen met with Hindenburg at Neudeck, the president had already signed the order to dissolve the House of Representatives and handed it to von Papen for safekeeping. Once something happens, it can be announced at any time. Thus, before the new parliament had even been successfully organized, it had already been sentenced to death. However, von Papen may not exercise the power of dissolution within a few days because von Papen's cabinet has already obtained Hindenburg's full protection and wants to first prove to the public that the various factions in the new House of Representatives are disorganized, have differing opinions, and cannot work properly before issuing the dissolution order.</p>
<p>▲Berlin, National News Agency, 31st – After being elected speaker, National Socialist member Göring telegraphed President Hindenburg, requesting to present the current situation of the parliament and the steps to organize a normal parliamentary government. After receiving Göring's telegram, Hindenburg replied that he would return to Berlin in a few days and would sincerely receive the representatives of the parliament at that time. Therefore, no major events are expected to occur between the parliament and the government in the next three or four days, because von Papen's statement of government policy to the parliament will have to wait until September 4th or 5th, and before that date, the parliament does not really have much important work to do.</p>
<h3>Reiterate Demand for Military Equality</h3>
<p>German Defense Minister Publishes an Article</p>
<p>▲Berlin, National News Agency, 30th – Today, German Defense Minister Schleicher published an important article in the "Hermesdorf" magazine, elaborating on the need for Germany's military to be equal to that of the major powers. Schleicher stated that the previous disarmament conferences not only failed to pay attention to Germany's reasonable demands, but also increasingly consolidated the existing system, which Germany can no longer tolerate. Schleicher further stated that if the countries do not have the sincerity to jointly reduce armaments in the future, then the increase in Germany's armaments is inevitable due to the pressure of the situation. Germany's powerful neighbors have already fully armed themselves from head to toe, and their national defense security, according to their own experts, is already completely secure. However, Germany's military is labeled with names such as nationalism and imperialism. In fact, what the German people desire is permanent peace and the peaceful existence and development of the nation. But in the current international situation, it is difficult for the German people to live and work in peace. The countries have built barriers on their borders, while Germany alone is not allowed to take measures to defend itself. Is this fair? Schleicher concluded that Germany does not want to immediately join the international arms race, but hopes to use its own resources to strengthen its national defense.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Proceeding with Shipbuilding Program</h3>
<p>New Submarine Launched</p>
<p>▲London, Havas Agency, 30th – Official sources claim that the Admiralty has decided to entrust three British private shipyards with the construction of the components for all the cruisers within the 1931 naval shipbuilding plan. Two other ships, the "Arethusa" and the "Amphion," will be built by state-owned shipyards. The aforementioned ships were supposed to begin construction in March 1931, but were delayed due to economic reasons. If the 1931 shipbuilding plan is completely successful, then there will still be eight destroyers, two submarines, and two small tugboats that need to be contracted out to private shipyards for construction.</p>
<p>▲London, Havas Agency, 30th – The newly built submarine "Porpoise" was launched at Barrow-in-Furness today.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Peers Opposes Seiyukai Proposals</h3>
<p>Government Optimistic About the Future of Parliament</p>
<p>▲Tokyo, United Press, 31st – The Japanese House of Peers convened at 10 AM this morning. Many members opposed the Seiyukai's rice law proposal. Although the Seiyukai's proposal passed the House of Representatives, it is determined that it will not pass the House of Peers. Prime Minister Saito has also resolved to maintain Minister of Agriculture Goto's policy, so he is very optimistic about the future of the parliament.</p>
<h3>Budget Passed by House of Representatives</h3>
<p>▲Tokyo, Denstu Agency, 31st – The Emergency Economic Relief Budget, with the attached resolution by the Seiyukai, passed the House of Representatives and was immediately sent back to the House of Peers.</p>
<p>▲Tokyo, Denstu Agency, 31st – The Seiyukai held a joint conference last night to discuss their attitude toward the budget. As a result, it was decided to approve it with the following three warnings: (1) the three-year continuation of the relief plan is not sufficient to meet the current emergency; (2) the entire budget cannot be said to be sufficient for relieving the economic situation; (3) upon the budget's approval, implementation must begin immediately.</p>
<h3>Motion to Impeach Minister Nagai Withdrawn</h3>
<p>▲Tokyo, Denstu Agency, 31st – The Seiyukai was considering submitting a motion of no confidence against Minister Nagai regarding the dismissal of former Karafuto Governor Kishimoto. Subsequently, as Minister Nagai made an apologetic explanation at the budget general meeting yesterday, and also because at this time of emergency, if party strategy problems cause a major wave, it may invite misunderstanding from the world, it was decided to withdraw the motion to impeach Minister Nagai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Red Movement</h3>
<p>Young Students' Ideologies Lean Left</p>
<p>Influence Spreads to Business and Industry</p>
<p>Authorities Severely Suppress, Over a Thousand Reported</p>
<p>▲The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports that since the repeated investigations of the Communist Party, there has been a resurgence of red reading groups organized by the education sector, the Communist Youth League, attempting to rebuild its activities, and its influence is quite strong. Participants in the group include Osaka High School, Osaka Commercial University, Naniwa High School, Kansai University, Kansai Gakuin, Osaka Dental College, Osaka Foreign Language School, and other schools. The members are all young students who directly promote red ideals and have established the Osaka Youth Communist League local committee. Its leaders are Hashimoto, Tamaki, Konishi, and Shimoji from Kishiwada Textile Bridge. These individuals incite red ideas within their respective schools while also participating in practical struggles outside the schools. Funds are provided by the National Council of Trade Unions to promote left-wing cultural movements, frequently distributing leaflets opposing imperialist war, and gradually spreading to factories in various locations. Furthermore, these left-leaning students are mostly the children of wealthy families, including the sons of viscounts, the sons of university presidents in Tokyo, and the nephews of naval admirals. In Osaka alone, there are as many as 172 student members. Public servants, school teachers, company clerks, shop assistants, and employees of various transportation agencies are also being increasingly expanded and strengthened. Especially since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident last year, at a time when people's hearts were shaken, they distributed anti-war leaflets in the Osaka barracks and army factories, or inserted unstable slogans, documents, and advertisements into items sent to soldiers on the front lines. They secretly investigated the deployment of troops, the construction of military factories, the location of ammunition depots, the location of gunpowder depots, and the names and addresses of senior military officers from company commanders down to the higher echelons. Consequently, soldiers such as Machioka Yuuo, a private first class in the 8th Regiment, were assimilated by the red ideology. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of the Osaka Prefecture Special Higher Police, the key figures were gradually arrested, preventing a major incident from occurring. Similar unstable red organizations exist in major cities such as Tokyo, Kyoto, and Kobe. Over the past year, over a thousand people have been reported.</p>
<h3>Anti-Imperialist War Congress Concludes</h3>
<p>Permanent Committee Established to Continue Congress Work</p>
<p>Premier's Wife Elected as One of the Committee Members</p>
<p>▲The Hague, TASS Agency, 31st – The World Anti-Imperialist War Congress concluded today. The last resolution passed was the establishment of a permanent anti-war committee with a headquarters in Paris to continue the work of the congress. Before closing, the congress delegates also passed a declaration to the workers of the world, the gist of which was to call on workers to pay attention to the approaching war and urge them to prepare to disrupt the imperialist war conspiracies. The representatives elected to the permanent committee include Gorky, Shivernik, and Mrs. Stasova from the Soviet Union; Barbusse and Romain Rolland from France; Einstein and Zetkin from Germany; Tang Maine from the United Kingdom; Tran San, Passes, and Da Luo from the United States; Mrs. Sun Yat-sen from China; Katayama Sen from Japan; Poguzh Vosky from Poland; and representatives from Italy, the Czech Republic, Scandinavia, Africa, the Balkans, and labor and peasant groups in France and Germany. The Physicians' Anti-War Conference also elected Pang Heim as a representative to participate in the permanent committee of the congress.</p>
<h3>Ecuadorian Rebels Occupy Armory</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Continues in Quito</p>
<p>▲Guayaquil, National News Agency, 30th – Fierce street fighting continues in Quito today. It is reported that government troops still hold the upper hand, but lack ammunition because the armory has been occupied by rebels.</p>
<h3>Invention of New Diving Gear</h3>
<p>▲Sydney, Australia, Havas Agency, 20th – A diver invented a new type of diving gear and publicly tested it. Local naval officials, engineers, and scholars were all in attendance. The diver wore the diving gear, entered the water, stayed at a depth of 50 meters for over an hour, and surfaced in less than four minutes. This invention is enough to revolutionize the method of diving into deep water. Today's achievements have set a world record.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Jehol Rising Up to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>History of the Jehol National Salvation Army</p>
<p>Jehol is a remote special region, which has gradually attracted attention since the recent invasion by the Japanese bandits. Its land is rich, not inferior to the Northeast, and its mineral resources are especially abundant. A brief summary of its situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Population: There has never been an accurate count of the population of Jehol. According to official investigations, there are 584,559 households in the entire region, with 2,166,146 men and 1,329,332 women, totaling 3,495,478 people. However, according to local estimates, the population has been increasing in recent years and is actually higher than this number. Approximately, the population of the entire region is over five million.</p>
<p>Climate: Similar to Hebei, with the seasons lagging by half a month. Mineral Resources: Coal and gold are the most abundant, followed by iron, then copper and tin. Asbestos, gemstones, and crystal are also found. The most notable is the petroleum mineral, with a total of four locations. The one in Jiufotang, 99 li south of Lingyuan County, has been repeatedly identified as very promising after many surveys. Unfortunately, the survey report has not been made public, so the details are unknown. There are also locations in Pingning City County. After the extension of our country's suspension, there are no large oil fields in the country. In this era of oil competition, Jehol is a treasure trove and covetted by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Waterfalls and Hydroelectric Power: There is a large waterfall in the northern mountains of Chifeng County. It has been estimated that if a hydroelectric power plant were built, the electricity could supply the entire region.</p>
<p>Culture: The four counties of Pingquan, Lingyuan, Chaoyang, and Chifeng are the most prosperous. Chifeng is the center of Jehol, with commerce concentrated there, and is considered the richest. Pingquan and Lingyuan are known for their talent and culture. Chaoyang is close to Liaoning and is quite prosperous. The remaining counties are mostly undeveloped.</p>
<p>History of the Jehol National Salvation Army: Jehol has a great hero, Huang Shouzhong, who enjoys local prestige. In 1923, the people suffered from the authorities' forced planting of opium and the heavy collection of opium taxes. Huang Shouzhong took the lead, contacted heroes from all over the region, and organized the local self-government army. The following year, Huang went to Beiping in disguise and met with Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Sun Yat-sen praised his aspirations and appointed Huang as the Special Military Commissioner for Inner Mongolia. Huang worked even harder upon receiving the order, gathered comrades, and secretly worked under the name of the militia, forming eight cavalry teams (each team roughly equivalent to a cavalry regiment), with both guns and horses equipped. This was the beginning of the Jehol National Salvation Army. When the Northern Expeditionary Army rose and the Northwest Army entered Beiping through an indirect route, Huang led his troops to respond, first raising the Blue Sky White Sun flag. The Northwest Army appointed Huang as the Commander-in-Chief of Jehol and fought with the Feng Army for years, eventually securing the entire territory of Jehol. Later, Yan Xishan of the Jin Army appointed Huang as the Commander-in-Chief of the Jehol Security Force. In 1928, Chiang Kai-shek sent Shang Wuzhai to present Huang with the appointment letter of the Commander of the First Cavalry Army of the National Revolutionary Army, ordering Huang to assist the Jin Army and pacify Jehol and Chahar. However, this incurred the jealousy of a certain general in the Jin Army, who, under the guise of issuing pay, lured Huang to Beiping, detained him at the Garrison Headquarters, and issued an order to encircle and attack his subordinates. His subordinates retreated to the border between Jehol and Chahar, protecting the local area and remaining steadfast. Later, with the strong protection of the local people, Huang was released from prison. Huang returned to Jehol, reorganized his troops, and continued to raise the banner of the self-government army, resisting the Jehol authorities' forced planting of opium and all illegal donations and taxes, protecting the people of one region. As a result, the united ranks became even broader, totaling ten militia units with over 30,000 people. When the September 18th Incident occurred, the leaders of the Jehol self-government army gathered in Longhua to discuss countermeasures. Huang strongly advocated that from now on, the guns should be pointed outwards, that past grievances with the Jehol authorities should be abandoned, and that they should unite to resist Japan. It was proposed to rename the self-government army the National Salvation Army, divided into ten routes, with commanders Geng Jizhou, Zhao Yi, Zhang Beifeng, etc. Over 8,000 troops from three routes entered Liaoning one after another and actively resisted Japan. Their battles have been reported in various newspapers. If the authorities can provide them with supplies and encouragement, they will be an extremely powerful anti-Japanese force between Jehol and Liaoning.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle of Ma Zhanshan in Hailun</h3>
<p>Japanese Planes Follow and Drop Bombs</p>
<p>Ma Meets with Representatives of the Investigation Team</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Massacre in Haibei Town</p>
<p>Ma's Army Isolated and Helpless, Extremely Worrisome</p>
<p>Hailun Correspondence: Chairman Ma arrived in Hailun from Heihe on May 1st. The next day, he led his troops out of the city to fight. At 6:00 AM on May 3rd, six Japanese planes flew in from the direction of Harbin and dropped over 50 bombs over Hailun. They also strafed the city's residents with machine guns. Dozens of sulfur bombs were dropped at the main intersection and the West Market, immediately starting fires that destroyed over 20 large and small businesses, over 30 brothels, and over 10 homes. About 30 people were killed or injured, with losses estimated at around one million yuan. When the bombs were dropped, Chairman Ma was residing in the Guangxintong Trading Company on East Main Street in Hailun. The 400 or so guards he brought were stationed in businesses and hotels and were not injured. Seeing the fire in the street, Chairman Ma personally risked his life to supervise the people in fighting the fire amidst a rain of bombs, loudly shouting for everyone to come and put out the fire. However, with bombs and machine-gun fire raining down, people were too busy trying to escape to even think about fighting the fire. Witnessing this tragedy, Chairman Ma couldn't help but weep in sorrow, saying, "This is the disaster I brought to Hailun," and so on. As he was grieving, Chairman Ma's guards and those around him urged him to return indoors to avoid danger. Chairman Ma said to them, "Don't be afraid. Life and death are destined." He only returned indoors after the Japanese planes left. The planes circled over Hailun for a total of 40 minutes, having exhausted all the bombs they carried. The 2,000 troops that Chairman Ma brought simultaneously fought the Japanese army south of Hailun City. Due to poor weaponry, they lost their combat capability and retreated into the city. On the morning of the 4th, Chairman Ma led his troops north, retreating 45 li to Haibei Town (also known as Dazhutang), where they stayed overnight. That same day, another Japanese plane came to Hailun to scout and dropped several bombs. On the 5th, Chairman Ma retreated from the Catholic Church toward the border of Tongbei County. The main force headed due north, while Chairman Ma retreated toward the southwest of Haibei Town. An hour before Chairman Ma left the town, another Japanese plane came to scout over the town's streets. It then quickly flew to a point 10 li north of the town, dropped two bombs into the ranks, and returned south. That day, Chairman Ma went to a villager's home in Moshizi Shijing to meet with representatives of the League of Nations investigation team. He reported in detail the war situation of the violent Japanese invasion of the Northeast and the Huhai line. After Chairman Ma parted with the representatives, he personally led 2,000 troops southward. At 3:00 PM on the 6th, two Japanese planes flew in from Harbin and arrived over Haibei Town, dropping over 20 bombs and firing machine guns, killing 19 innocent men and women and injuring four. The planes circled for half an hour before flying away. On the 7th, two more planes came to Zejia Town (in Tongbei County), 40 li north of Haibei Town, dropping bombs and killing and wounding six people. Because the town had only about 30 households, the casualties were not high. On the 9th, two more Japanese planes came to the skies over Tongbei County, dropping bombs and killing or wounding three or four residents. Again, because the county was sparsely populated, with only about 100 households in the entire city, not many people were injured. After bombing the two counties of Hai and Tong and various towns, the Japanese planes went to explode in the Longzhen County Nanbei'an area and also bombed Keshan County, Kedong County, Dedu County, and other places. The number of people injured is unknown but likely not small. In short, the entire Jiang Province, except for the frontier counties far away, suffered from the bombing. All counties within a thousand li of Harbin, Hailun, Suihua, and Bokui were not spared. Therefore, there are Japanese airstrips everywhere. The situation in places already occupied by the Japanese army is especially tragic.</p>
<p>When 500 Japanese soldiers first arrived in Hailun, they stayed in various businesses, not moving into the old military camps of our army. Later, over 2,000 more soldiers were successively added, totaling over 3,000. Various obstacles were set up in the main streets and alleys to prevent our army from attacking. Barbed wire was used to weave obstacle nets in the middle of the alleys, with doors left open during the day and closed at night. At every intersection and main street, sandbag bunkers were built and guarded day and night. Later, 300 Japanese infantry and cavalry also arrived in Haibei Town to garrison it, with the same equipment as in Hailun. When Infantry Major Ishikawa Shigeru entered the town, he engaged in public buying and selling. Unexpectedly, on the night of June 10th, Deng Wen, the brigade commander under Chairman Ma, sent over 200 cavalry from a certain regiment to sneak across the town moat and enter the town, opening fire on the Japanese guards. The two sides immediately started fighting, fighting for about five hours. At dawn, our army withdrew, killing over ten Japanese soldiers, wounding six or seven, and capturing four alive. Our side had five or six soldiers killed in action. Unexpectedly, after our army retreated, the Japanese falsely accused the residents of Haibei Town of colluding with outsiders. They then stabbed and buried alive 108 residents of the town and villagers who came to the market early in the morning. Any able-bodied men they encountered were killed with bayonets and buried on the spot. Regardless of whether it was in the center of the street or in the alleys, graves were everywhere. Captain Ishikawa then reported to Brigade Commander Hiraga Teizo that the residents of Haibei Town were all in league with Ma and that there were no good people. He requested that the entire town be destroyed with artillery fire. On the 12th, the Japanese dispatched an artillery detachment, carrying several mountain guns, from Hailun's north gate toward Haibei Town. While traveling to the Qixingpao area, the artillery vehicles got stuck in a mud ditch and could not be pulled out. Later, through the pleas of the director of the Hailun Collection Bureau and the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce to Commander Hiraga, the disaster of destruction was averted. The 8,000 lives of Haibei were almost tragically poisoned. Although this battle turned out to be a blessing in disguise, sporadic abuse was unavoidable. From then on, the Japanese army arbitrarily robbed merchants and civilians for food, lodging, and purchases. They also secretly colluded with Koreans to forcibly rob and extort money. All kinds of situations are difficult to describe in detail. The Japanese in Hailun received many secret letters every day. If someone harbored a grudge and secretly reported someone to the Japanese, falsely accusing them of being Chairman Ma's spy, they would be arrested, immediately shot, and buried alive. In Hailun, the streets were cleared every day at 8:00 PM. Anyone who was even slightly late would be killed without exception. Since May 4th, businesses in Hailun and Haibei have been completely closed. Although they were later forced to reopen, without farmers coming to the market, opening the door was the same as closing it. The disaster in Haibei Town was even worse than in Hailun because Haibei was a necessary route to Tongbei, Keshan, and other places. Japanese troops going north were bound to pass through it. Later, the Japanese again forced people to carry ammunition and supplies. If they tried to escape, they would be shot. All the vehicles, horses, and cattle in the town had fled. In the end, only one-tenth of the residents remained in the town.</p>
<p>The wealthy villagers of the Northeast usually prepared firearms and built walls and bunkers. At this moment, they have all been broken and looted. As far as the counties of Jiang Province are concerned, the people suffered such a tragic disaster at the hands of the Japanese army that it surpassed the time when Korea was destroyed. Currently, in Jiang Province, besides a portion of Chairman Ma's army, there are seven brigades including Cheng, Tu, Su, Pu, Zhou, Jia, and Zhang, who have surrendered to Japan. These troops have recently been chasing after Ma's army, and the two sides have engaged in several fierce battles, killing each other. Currently, Chairman Ma has retreated to the mountainous area east of Tieli County. His subordinates number only about 10,000 people and are in great danger under the pursuit of the Japanese army. Japanese planes follow and bomb them all day long. They move every night and hide in rural villagers' homes during the day. Currently, Deng Wen and Li Haiqing's armies, numbering about 10,000, attacked Haibei Town before July 20th because there were over 100 Japanese soldiers in Haibei surveying the route, planning to extend the Huhai Railway from Hailun northward to Keshan County and connect it with the Tao'ang Railway. Construction will begin soon, and it is scheduled to be completed to Haibei Town by the end of August. This section is 45 Chinese li long. Chairman Ma is eager to destroy this plan.</p>
<p>Most worrying is that Chairman Ma's army has fallen into a state of isolation and extreme danger. If the central government does not send troops soon, it will be difficult to sustain for long. Because the Japanese army is determined to defeat Chairman Ma, they coordinate land and air attacks every time they engage Ma in battle. The air force, in addition to dropping bombs, also serves as artillery targeters. The artillery fire is extremely fierce. Ma's army has no air defense weapons and can only use flesh and blood to resist the enemy. There is no good strategy. Ammunition is especially scarce.</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of the Harbin Flood</h3>
<p>The Puppet Government Had No Disaster Prevention Preparedness</p>
<p>Japanese Military Police Took the Opportunity to Oppress Disaster Victims</p>
<p>The Entire City Became a Marsh, Few Escaped</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: After being ravaged by the Japanese, Harbin had barely extinguished the flames of war when it was tragically flooded on August 7th. Except for the elevated Qinjiagang and Majiagou areas, the entire city was underwater. The water was deepest in Daowai, ranging from eight chi to one zhang, five or six chi, disrupting transportation. Boat traffic was necessary in the city. Telephone and electric lights were also cut off. In Daoli, the area around 36 Peng and Zhengyang River was four or five chi deep. The usually prosperous Central Avenue was five chi deep, and transportation could only be done by boat. Puppet government officials paid no attention, causing all 300,000 residents of the city to suffer. To this day, all businesses have stopped, and there is no end in sight to the flooding. The prosperity of Harbin is almost hopeless. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Situation When Water First Rose in Daowai</p>
<p>▲Rivers Rose Greatly: The weather this summer, starting from June 2nd, was rainy every other day, and sometimes it rained continuously for several days and nights. Until late July, the rain did not stop. Various rivers were scoured by mountain floods and fed by tributaries, causing the water level to rise greatly. The Songhua River is the only main stream of various rivers in northern Manchuria, and it received the most flow. Since June 25th, the water volume has been rising daily. Even the usually shallow shoals in the downstream areas of Mantianxing and Sankuishi were more than one zhang deep. Initially, the cities and towns along the river regarded the rising water as a customary event every year and paid no attention to it. They were also negligent in their defenses. By July 25th, Yilan, with its lower terrain downstream and shallow riverbanks, was the first to be flooded. The riverbank was ten li away from the city, but the water still overflowed and entered the entire city. By the 28th, the entire city was submerged in water. At the same time, the Mudan River also overflowed its banks. The two rivers merged, and the water depth in the city reached one zhang, four or five chi. Even the shallowest areas were over five chi deep. Homes and government buildings were all in the water. Countless people and animals died. Disaster victims struggled in the water, fleeing to nearby mountains and living in the open air. Because food and supplies had been submerged, many victims had nothing to eat and picked leaves to fill their stomachs. Although boats were used in the city, they were requisitioned by the Japanese military and puppet government agencies. Weak families were unable to break free. Countless people were washed away by the flood. However, at this time, Harbin upstream still believed that the flood would not come suddenly, so no precautions were taken.</p>
<p>▲Water Forces Harbin: After July 29th, the Songhua River rose rapidly by one or two chi per day. The embankments of Bin City had only four chi exposed above the water. The embankment was built in August of the ninth year of the Republic of China, starting from First Avenue Street in Binjiang City and ending at Eighteenth Avenue Street in Binjiang City. The entire line was over 430 zhang long. From Eighteenth Avenue Street to Twentieth Avenue Street, it turned to the base of Jiajiagang, a high ground, which was an old-style earthen embankment. The entire line was 280 zhang long. When the river rose greatly in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the Binjiang gentleman silk organization's River Embankment Project Office added a two-chi-wide and three-chi-high brick dam on top of the stone dam. However, the project was very simple. Since the addition, the water has not exceeded the stone dam, so it is not known whether the brick dam is effective. The river water in the past was mostly about three zhang away from the dam and never reached the base of the dam. After the water rose, the river widened. This time, the water reached the base of the dam and gradually rose higher. The Harbin International Association, seeing that no puppet government officials paid attention, risked violating the strict news censorship and published news that the rising river water threatened people's lives. This lasted for a week. At that time, the water level had risen to within half a chi of the stone dam, leaving only the one or two chi of brick dam added in the twelfth year. At this time, the Binjiang gentry merchants and puppet government officials began to pay attention. However, they all had the mentality of benefiting from their neighbors, thinking that the northern bank of Jiang, Machuankou, and Songpu Town were lower in elevation. If the river rose further, the water would definitely flow to the northern bank, and the southern bank would be safe. Therefore, although the River Embankment Project Office, led by the Chamber of Commerce, held two meetings, they were full of disputes and could not come up with a solution. In the end, they only slightly prepared sandbags and piled them up at the intersections of the docks on Seventh, Twelfth, and Eighteenth Avenue Streets in Binjiang City. Although the merchants and civilians were panicked, they still hoped that the brick dam would not collapse. But at 8:00 AM on the 4th, the river rose again. Machuankou on the northern bank, with its lower riverbank, was submerged. The dike first breached behind the Tangguantun Hulan Sugar Factory and flowed in. In less than two hours, the entire city of Songpu and Machuankou was flooded. The vital Xingquan Avenue was about one zhang deep, and the current was very rapid. Even boats could not easily enter. Over 10,000 residents were caught off guard and unable to escape. They all fled to the roofs. Furniture and belongings could not be retrieved. Fortunately, it was daytime, and no one drowned. In the afternoon, the Harbin Red Swastika Society and the Charity Federation hired over ten large ships to transport disaster victims to Harbin to temporarily reside in Nangang. However, the victims were still told to find their own open-air places to stay. After the entire city of Songpu was flooded, the river flowed toward Hulan County. The Hu-Hai Railway in the section of Songpu and Machuankou was washed away in many places. Crops and homes were all washed away. Dozens of villages were flooded. From Machuankou northward for about 70 li, there was an endless expanse of water. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>▲Moxie Newspaper Closed Down: The Moxie Newspaper in our county has been in operation for many years. It was initially changed to a daily newspaper in August, hoping to develop further. Unexpectedly, on the 19th and 28th, due to the publication of an article about business tax, the county government believed that it contained words that incited the people and resisted national taxes. On the 29th, the newspaper was closed down, and the director, Zhu Tieying, was summoned. The county magistrate, Zhao Enju, personally opened the case and sentenced Zhu to one year of imprisonment and a fine of one hundred yuan in accordance with the publication law.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The High Court Sends Personnel to Escort Hu Lifu: The notorious traitor Hu Lifu, since being arrested by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and transferred to the capital for military law trial, was approved to be handed over to the judicial authorities for handling. It was then assigned to the jurisdiction of the Jiangsu High Court. The Suzhou High Court Prosecutor's Office received a telegram from the Ministry of Justice yesterday (the 31st), ordering the dispatch of personnel to Beijing to escort him. After receiving the order, Chief Wang immediately appointed Secretary Pang to supervise Judicial Policeman Bu Guisheng and Bailiff Ren Bingguang to go to Beijing by car. They are scheduled to escort him to Suzhou this afternoon (the 1st). After the Prosecutor's Office investigates, it will prepare to send him to the Siqian Street Detention Center for detention.</p>
<p>▲The Prosecutor Appeals the Xu Yabo Case: Xu Yabo, the former district chief of the First District of the Provincial Water Police, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the Songjiang County Court for the crimes of joint robbery and receiving stolen goods. He appealed to the High Court. The Third Criminal Division of the High Court, headed by Judge Song, made a judgment on the 19th of this month, revoking the original judgment and acquitting Xu Yabo. The judgment was delivered the day before yesterday. Yesterday, it was learned that the original prosecutor of the case, Wang Shicheng, declared that he was dissatisfied with Xu's acquittal and filed an appeal. The written appeal was notified to Xu Yabo yesterday (the 31st), ordering him to submit a defense if he had any reasons.</p>
<p>▲Lake Bandits are Active in the Countryside Again: On the morning of the 31st, over 30 bandit boats carrying two to three hundred bandits were discovered on the waters of Baxian River and Taishi Dian River between Zhouzhuang and Chenmu. They were moving southwest. Upon hearing the news, the Second Detachment of the Jiaozhi Police Station urgently telegraphed Zhouzhuang, Chenmu, Chefang, and Guoxiang to be on guard. It also dispatched troops to gather at Chefang to intercept them. On the city side, the Third District of the Water Public Security Bureau also dispatched two warships to join the military and police and set off for Chenghu to meet the bandits. Also, the Water Patrol Second Squad of the Police Team encountered four bandit boats carrying over sixty bandits from Henan on the Zhuangzi Bridge between Dongshan and Hengjing at 6:00 AM on the 30th. They immediately opened fire to suppress them. The bandits also returned fire. After half an hour, the bandits fled to South Taihu. As a result, one kidnapped person was shot down.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲Various Counties Vigorously Contend for Half of the Acreage Surtax for Road Construction: The Wuxi County Government previously received a joint telegram from the Finance and Construction Departments, ordering it to remit half of the local surtax of five fen per mu for road construction to the departments for use as funds for the construction of national and provincial highways, and instructing the Finance Bureau to report the collected amount and remit it along with the land tax on a ten-day basis. The county party headquarters and various mass organizations believed that provincial and county administrations each had their own systems and that operating expenses should be kept within boundaries and not mixed, so as not to start a trend of disorder. The surtax for road construction in various counties of Jiangsu Province is a special fund for local construction in the county, used for the construction of county roads. It has always been kept in the custody of the county construction bureau. Moreover, when the surtax was initially levied, the Jiangsu Provincial Government had repeatedly and clearly stipulated the purpose of the fund, and it should not be suddenly overturned, lest there be a suspicion of changing orders every morning and evening. They telegraphed the central and provincial departments separately, requesting that the case of remitting half of the acreage surtax for road construction to the province be revoked in order to maintain local undertakings and avoid confusing finances. At the same time, various counties such as Wuxian, Wujin, Jiangyin, Liyang, and Changshu also filed petitions to the central and provincial departments, requesting the revocation of this case. Subsequently, Construction Department Director Dong brought up the 524th provincial government meeting, which resolved that half of the acreage surtax for road construction in each county should be remitted to the province in order to centralize funds, coordinate the development of branch lines throughout the province, and seek to facilitate transportation throughout the province. It was not to be used for other purposes. Now that the case has been confirmed, it should be earnestly implemented and cannot be changed due to misunderstandings in a few localities. Another circular should be issued for compliance.</p>
<p>▲Substandard Yarn Seized and Scheduled for Burning: The Wuxi Committee for Suppressing Enemy Goods seized ten pieces of substandard yarn at Laoyabang. They reported it to the county party headquarters for instructions. Now, they have received an approval order and have decided at a committee meeting to burn the substandard yarn at the open space west of the train station on the 5th of this month. They have also sent letters to various organizations, inviting them to send personnel to observe at that time.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>▲Provincial Government Requests Commendation for Two Virtuous Women: Dai Wang Sitian, a virtuous woman from Pi County, remained chaste in her youth and continued the legacy of her aunt, Dai Dong Shumin. In the 17th and 21st years of the Republic of China, she donated a total of 110,000 yuan for the operation of schools and public welfare. Acting County Magistrate Sun of the county petitioned the Jiangsu Provincial Government for commendation. Now, the provincial government believes that the two women pledged in their youth to remain chaste until old age, demonstrating the integrity of ice and frost, and expanded the regulations of the school system, destroying their families to start schools, a situation worthy of commendation. They have requested the Ministry of the Interior to petition the Executive Yuan to forward a request to the National Government for the issuance of plaques and medals of honor, and to add laudatory words to commend their virtue and inspire others.</p>
<p>▲Good Autumn Harvest and Falling Rice Prices: Since the beginning of autumn this year, rice prices have been falling due to sluggish sales, which is unprecedented in the rice market. The weather has been particularly hot in recent days, and new grain from various places is about to be harvested. Rice prices have fallen further. The higher prices are only 14 yuan, while the lowest Saigon rice is only over 9 yuan. It is said that those in the industry say that if the weather does not change, the autumn harvest will be abundant, and the price of new rice will continue to fall. This is good news for the future of the people's food.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>▲Bandits Rob Grain Shop and Burn Owner: In Gongjin Township, Sixth District of the county, on the night of the 28th, dozens of bandits armed with Mauser pistols rushed to the home of Yang Tingzhen, the owner of the Lu Chen rice shop, and looted it clean. They burned Yang Tingzhen badly and demanded that Yang hand over silver dollars. After searching for several hours, they fired their guns and dispersed. Yang has crossed the river to the Hongjiang Hospital for treatment. His family has come to the city to report the case. It is also said that the bandits who were previously discovered by Sun Tan Xuewen in the case of the kidnapped six-year-old child, Ye Shihua, lived in the west of Yingxu Lake. Today (the 30th), the county detective team has dispatched detectives Ma Chunshan and Gao Lian to lead a team by boat to Bao to investigate the victims and arrest the bandits.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>▲Large Group of Kidnappers Not Found: According to confidential reports from military and police agencies, a large group of kidnappers from Hongze Lake, holding many kidnapped men and women, secretly came to Nantong and stayed in various hotels on Taowu Road to negotiate ransoms.

<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>▲Extortion Failed, Victim Killed: In Zou Guojiaxia, Liuzhuang, Dongchen District of Jiagao, a Chen family, who opened an oil workshop and were wealthy, were suddenly broken into by over ten bandits on the night of the 27th. They were armed with guns and demanded 2,000 silver dollars, but they failed. They shot and killed the two Chen brothers and left. The family reported to the district office, which relayed the message to the county government to send personnel to investigate. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Qian and Judge Li Cheng personally went to investigate at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 28th).</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Shanghai Probably Will Not See War Again</h3>
<p>Talks with Commander Dai</p>
<p>Observations by Ariyoshi</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, rumors have been rampant in the city these days, almost all saying that a second war is about to break out in Shanghai. As a result, residents in Zhabei and Nanshi have been relocating continuously for days. The panic is almost the same as before the January 28 Incident. Yesterday, the public was even more alarmed, and more people moved. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Dai Ji, commander of the Songhu Garrison, and Yano, acting Japanese Minister to China, to inquire about the truth of these rumors. Commander Dai and Ariyoshi, Counselor of the Japanese Consulate, provided detailed answers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Dai Ji's Talk The Central News Agency reporter visited Dai Ji, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, at the headquarters yesterday morning to inquire about the recent installation of military telephones by the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai and various rumors circulating outside. The reporter asked if the headquarters had received any formal reports on these matters. According to Dai, although these rumors are mostly groundless, some points are supported by facts. For example, the headquarters has received formal and concrete reports about the Japanese army installing military telephones in western Shanghai. As for their intentions, outsiders cannot fathom them. Because the Japanese army is well-trained, military secrets are difficult for the outside world to discover. This patriotic movement has achieved considerable results. The Japanese side's preparations may be for this reason. As for the rumors that a second war is about to break out in Shanghai, according to my observation, it may not come to this. In the January 28 Incident, the Japanese side did not gain any advantage. This time, they probably won't sacrifice money and lives again in vain. However, the Japanese side hates our country's patriotic movement and may use it as an excuse to expand the issue. We must take precautions. Therefore, I hope those involved in the patriotic movement will be extra cautious to avoid giving the Japanese side any pretext. As for public security in the urban area, I will do my best to maintain it. In Zhabei, there are security teams maintaining security. In Nanshi, there is a regiment of troops newly arrived from Zhejiang Province and police stationed there. There is no need to worry about maintaining normal public security. There are already more than three thousand Japanese troops in Shanghai, and their firearms are sophisticated. If they disregard everything and act, I, as a soldier, have a responsibility to defend the territory. I will do my best to fulfill my duty. The reporter also asked that recently, the Northeast Volunteer Army's counter-offensive is extremely urgent. Is the Japanese side concentrating the Third Fleet to disturb the Yangtze River area to create a diversion? Dai replied that the three northeastern provinces have been invaded, and they are now planning to use all their strength to seize Rehe. If our country proceeds to recover lost territory, Japan will definitely demonstrate and create a diversion in the Yangtze River area, and so on.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Statement The Central News Agency reporter then visited Yano, Acting Japanese Minister to China, at the Japanese Consulate. Because Yano was out on official business, Ariyoshi, First-Class Chinese Counselor, received the reporter. According to Ariyoshi, the six-point plan for Japan to disturb Shanghai again, as reported in the newspaper this morning, is completely inaccurate. The reporter also asked that recently, the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai has installed military telephones in western Shanghai and conducted armed demonstrations, causing panic among all sectors, who believe that a second war is about to break out. What does the Japanese side have to say to alleviate the public's panic? Ariyoshi replied that he is not very clear about the situation in Shanghai. However, according to his observation, Shanghai probably will not see a second war again.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Explains Rumors</h3>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, rumors have been spreading for days that Japanese plainclothes soldiers and Red Shirt gangs are appearing in Zhabei and other places from time to time, causing residents there to relocate one after another. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency specifically inquired about these two matters with Japanese Consul Shirai Yasushi yesterday, requesting an explanation. According to Shirai, there are no Japanese plainclothes soldiers appearing in Zhabei. The origin of these rumors is mostly due to ignorant people seeing Japanese people traveling to and from Zhabei, suspecting them of being plainclothes soldiers, and spreading the rumor from one person to ten, and from ten to a hundred, causing the rumors to spread throughout Shanghai. In fact, most of these Japanese people traveling to and from Zhabei are Japanese residents living in Zhabei, and their range is only near North Sichuan Road. Those further away cannot see them. As for the so-called Red Shirt Gang, the municipal government has not protested to the Japanese consulate. However, if such organizations disturb the security of the concession, the Japanese authorities will definitely take action to suppress them.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Japanese-language newspaper in this city reported that Japanese Navy Commander Sugisaka will demand that Chinese newspapers cancel articles containing [anti-Japanese] and [insulting to Japan] content, and stated that he is determined to take decisive measures. The method will probably be the same as the treatment of the "Min Guo Daily" before the Shanghai Incident. The situation seems quite dangerous. However, the Japanese consul said that Sugisaka only told Japanese reporters that he will demand that Chinese newspapers suppress news containing [anti-Japanese] and [insulting to Japan] content, and there is no such thing as imitating the handling of the "Min Guo Daily."</p>
<h3>Residents of Zhabei and Hongkou Moved South Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Intersection of the Chinese and Concession Areas Was Blocked</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Sent Police to劝阻 (persuade and stop) Without Success</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, due to various rumors in Zhabei and Hongkou recently, generally nervous people are relocating again. Starting at dawn yesterday, people carrying luggage and hiring cars moved south to take refuge in the concession. The intersection of the Chinese and concession areas, such as Baoshan Road, Kaifeng Road, and Qiujiang Road, was blocked for a time. The Fourth and Fifth District Offices of the Municipal Public Security Bureau separately sent police to persuade and stop them, but it was ineffective.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Bureau Workers Striked for Two Hours Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Request for a Pay Raise Was Not Fulfilled, So They Went on Strike</p>
<p>The Business Director Mediated and Resumed Work</p>
<p>Because the telegraph workers' request to improve treatment and increase wages was not fulfilled, a half-day strike occurred on August 2. Subsequently, Zhong Xun, Director of the Telegraph Administration, accepted the request and set a pay raise of two yuan per person, which was implemented in stages, and then work was resumed. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. However, yesterday, the telegraph workers in this city suddenly announced a strike again at 3:00 p.m. The reporters immediately rushed to investigate and learned that it was still due to the pay raise issue. According to the workers, when they requested a pay raise in early August, Director Zhong promised that the telegraph bureau workers and the radio station workers would implement it at the same time starting in August. When the radio station workers were paid on August 25, the approved pay raise of two yuan was paid out. However, the official order for the telegraph bureau workers' pay raise has not yet been approved. On the 26th, representatives were sent to meet with the director to inquire about the matter. The director sent Li Gongwei, director of the cashier section, to meet with them on his behalf. Li promised to forward the representatives' opinions to the director and telegraphed the ministry to request expedited approval. The representatives then withdrew. Yesterday was the day for the bureau workers to receive their monthly salary. When the workers received their salary, they saw that the approved pay raise of two yuan had not been added. They again sent representatives to question the director. The bureau replied that they had not received an approval order. The representatives immediately reported back to the workers. As a result, the 55 workers were very dissatisfied and decided to go on strike to urge the authorities to realize the situation. Fei Hengfu, the bureau's business director, believed that the workers' strike was of great importance to transportation. He took the initiative to mediate with the workers' representatives. After several consultations between the bureau and the workers, the result was that before the approval order for the pay raise was received, the two yuan of wages that each worker should receive would be temporarily advanced by the bureau starting from that day. The workers were satisfied and resumed work at 5:00 p.m., delivering telegrams as usual.</p>
<h3>The Sanyou Factory Dispute Was Arbitrated at the Municipal Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Employer Did Not Send a Representative to Attend</p>
<p>The Result Was Officially Announced</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the long-delayed Sanyou Industrial Society factory closure dispute was formally submitted to arbitration at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. All the arbitration committee members and labor representatives were present, but the employer was absent at the last minute. The result has been announced. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲The Arbitration Process The arbitration officially began at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Those present were Luo Panhui (Municipal Government), Chairman of the Arbitration Committee, Lu Jingshi (Municipal Party Headquarters), Yang Peng (Special District First Court), Pang Shurong (Local Court), Xu Jilong (Municipal Chamber of Commerce), Zhao Shusheng (General Labor Union), Gong Yuting and Xia Zhongzhao, labor representatives, and Chen Tian, ​​recorder. Zhou Xuexiang and Shao Xubai from the General Labor Union also attended. The employer only submitted a petition and did not send a representative to attend. First, Counselor Luo Panhui, Chairman, declared that the Sanyou Factory dispute had been delayed for a long time. The Social Affairs Bureau was repeatedly ordered to organize a mediation committee to implement mediation, but it was ineffective. Now, the municipal government has received a telegram from the central government and requests from both parties, so it is specifically submitting it to arbitration. Although the employer is not present today, there is no problem. Therefore, it is still officially arbitrating according to the law. Then, the labor representatives stated the process of the dispute, hoping that the members would make a final and fair ruling to relieve the workers' suffering. Then, the arbitration committee members raised questions about the two fires in the factory and whether there were any difficulties in starting the factory, which were answered in detail by Gong Yuting, the labor representative. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>▲Announcement of the Ruling After the arbitration was adjourned, the arbitration committee members went to the conference room on the second floor to hold an arbitration meeting. They immediately decided on four measures. Each member signed the main text of the draft and announced the official ruling. The full text of the ruling will be officially released after the reasons are supplemented. The content principles are as follows: (1) Restore the work of the Shanghai factory, at least one-fifth of the total. If it cannot be restored immediately, a preparation period of three months is allowed. During the preparation period, food should be provided to the workers according to the original maintenance fee amount. (3) The remaining employees should be dismissed in accordance with the original labor-capital contract. (4) If the Shanghai and Hangzhou factories need to add workers, they should give priority to hiring from the dismissed workers.</p>
<p>▲Pan Xulun's Statement Accountant Pan Xulun sent a letter to Sanyou Industrial Co., Ltd. yesterday, making a statement regarding the factory closure audit. The draft letter is as follows: [To Whom It May Concern: I have checked the advertisements published by your company in the local newspapers, which stated that our company had to close the factory due to irresistible war damage, and the Social Affairs Bureau ordered accountant Pan Xulun to review and verify the evidence. This accountant was ordered to review your company's accounts and only reported all facts in accordance with the points inquired by the Social Affairs Bureau. As for whether your company's factory closure was necessary, it should be decided by the competent authority with reference to the facts. This accountant's audit report does not contain any such proof. Your company's advertisement is deeply afraid of causing misunderstandings among all parties. I hereby make a statement and ask you to check and correct it. Sincerely, Sanyou Industrial Co., Ltd.]</p>
<h3>Xu Chongdao's Labor Dispute Was Mediated by the Party and Government Yesterday Without Success</h3>
<p>The Labor Side Proposed Four Demands</p>
<p>The Employer Filed a Petition Asking the Authorities to Strictly Stop It</p>
<p>More than 200 employees of all branches of Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store in the city suddenly launched a joint strike the day before yesterday. Party and government agencies, together with representatives of the pharmaceutical industry trade union, rushed to mediate yesterday, but the mediation failed due to the labor and management sides holding different views.</p>
<p>▲Party and Government Mediation After this incident occurred, in order to quickly resolve it, the party and government agencies dispatched Yu Zhongbiao of the People's Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters and Zhu Guilin of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, together with Fang Qingjian, director of the Pharmaceutical Industry Trade Union, Wang Youling and Sun Zixue, representatives of the Xu Chongdao group, and Zhang Mei'an, representative of the industry association, to mediate at the main store on Avenue Edward VII at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. The mediation failed due to the two sides holding different views.</p>
<p>▲Four Demands According to the labor spokesperson, after Zheng Peiran was detained and released, all employees heard the news and immediately convened a team leader meeting. Seven representatives were elected to negotiate with the employer, but they were rejected. A general meeting of all members was reconvened and it was decided to strike to assist them. A strike committee of 23 people, a maintenance team of 21 people, and a transportation team of 5 people were elected to be responsible for carrying out all matters, and four conditions were agreed upon: (1) Dismiss Qu Min and Lou Hechao, the manager of the Seventh Branch. (2) Compensate Zheng Peiran for the loss of reputation. (3) Guarantee the safety of all employees in the future. (4) Pay wages as usual during the strike period and bear all losses by the employer. We will never resume work until the goal is achieved.</p>
<p>▲Store Petition Presented in order to accuse and coerce, illegally strike, endanger business and people's livelihood, please give a strict ruling according to law, and order the resumption of work. The subordinate branch No. 7 is located in the Zhongzhong Road. At about 5:00 a.m. on August 28, when Zheng Peiran, an employee of our store, returned to the store from outside, he noticed that valuable Chinese goods such as ginseng, swallow's nest, and deer antler were missing from the display cabinet. The number was very large, estimated to be worth about 400 yuan. The branch manager Lou Heming telegraphed our general manager and asked for instructions. Our general manager believed that the theft case was criminal, so he telegraphed Qu Ming, the branch manager of the No. 1 branch, to issue a loss sheet and report it to the relevant police station. Later, a detective from the police station came to the store to investigate and believed that the case was internal, so he interrogated all the employees of the branch one by one. As a result, Zheng Peiran looked flustered and his words were contradictory, so he was identified as the most suspected and taken to the police station for questioning. Later, because there was no evidence, Zheng was released and returned to the store. Zheng Peiran falsely accused Qu Ming of deliberately framing him and immediately convened a meeting of all the team leaders of this general branch to request assistance. The team leaders were deceived and decided to request our general manager to immediately dismiss Qu Ming from his position in order to quell public anger. It was found that Qu Ming's report of the theft case to the police station was commissioned by our general manager and did not falsely accuse Zheng Peiran of being the thief. How could it be said that he was framing him? The team leader meeting only relied on Zheng Peiran's false accusation and requested the store to dismiss Qu Ming from his position. Our general manager naturally found it difficult to accept. Unexpectedly, the team leaders convened a general meeting of more than 200 employees from all the branches of this general branch yesterday morning and decided to strike unanimously, only to achieve the purpose of immediately dismissing Qu Ming from his position. This kind of excessive action is disregarding the law. In order to seek an emergency solution and prevent a strike tide, the subordinate branch specifically approved the dispatch of representatives Cen Zhiliang and others to respectfully visit your meeting and ask for prompt relief. The comrade Yu Zhongbiao, sent by your meeting, and the representative Chen Liangping from the Social Affairs Bureau, rushed to the subordinate branch to thoroughly investigate the truth. At that time, Zhao Zhenhui and Fang Qingjian, representatives of the Pharmaceutical Industry Trade Union, and Zhang Mei'an, representative of the Chinese Medicine Industry Association, were all in the subordinate branch to mediate. They also invited various representatives such as Cen Yongkang and Yang Xihui, the chairmen of the small group of the subordinate branch. They all believed that the dispute between Qu Ming and Zheng Peiran was a judicial issue and should be resolved by the judicial authorities and did not involve the store. They also believed that the employees' announcement of the strike without legal procedures was inappropriate and advised them to resume work by a certain date. However, despite the representatives' bitter persuasion, the employees still insisted as before, resulting in no result. Thinking that the pharmaceutical industry is related to people's livelihood and that the strike violates the prohibited regulations, the employees are only using a strike to coerce the employer because of personal disputes, causing the subordinate branch's business to suffer losses and endangering people's livelihood. I am deeply afraid that if this trend continues, the future of commerce will be unimaginable. I am hereby expressing my distress and respectfully ask your meeting to strictly rule according to the law and order all the employees of the subordinate branch to resume work by a certain date in order to respect the law. Otherwise, in order to defend itself, the subordinate branch will take decisive measures. I am at a loss for words to express my urgent desire to obey the order.</p>
<p>▲Corrected News The employer of the store believed that there were discrepancies with the facts in the news published by the Dagong News Agency yesterday, so they specifically sent a letter to correct it. The news about the labor unrest in our store published in your newspaper yesterday stated that the police detectives identified Zheng Peiran as a suspect of theft and immediately arrested him. The employees were shocked and specifically requested the general manager Cen Zhiliang to bail Zheng Jun from the police station within one hour. This is inconsistent with the facts. Zheng Peiran was taken to the police station for questioning by the detectives because of contradictory words and was immediately released. There was no detention, and the employees did not request the general manager to bail Zheng Jun. I am sincerely afraid that this will cause misunderstandings from the outside world. Please correct it in your newspaper to clarify the facts.</p>

<p>▲Business as Usual The store has been operating as usual for two days since all the employees suddenly went on strike on a pretext. Because the pharmaceutical industry strike is related to people's livelihood and is very important, in order to supply the needs of patients and maintain social stability, during the strike period, they have exhausted all efforts to distribute all the dozens of senior employees of the store to all the branches to take charge of various departments such as retail, wholesale, prescription medicine, and medicine preparation for customers. Therefore, they can operate as usual and cope with it easily. In addition, the store has a complete organization and sufficient inventory to meet long-term needs and will never feel difficult. It has been announced to all sectors that they will continue to patronize as usual. Retail and wholesale on the past two days have been operating as usual.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Nanshi Public Bus Company Paid Off Back Wages Yesterday After Closing</h3>
<p>The Request for Dissolution Fees Will Be Mediated at a Later Date</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Nanshi Public Bus Company's board of directors decided to temporarily suspend operations, all the workers put forward conditions. The day before yesterday, the party and government agencies mediated the labor-capital dispute, which temporarily came to an end. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Decided Measures The Social Affairs Bureau dispatched Peng Zhenqiu and the Municipal Party Headquarters dispatched Fan Guoren to rush to the company at 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday to thoroughly investigate the truth and mediate accordingly. The workers put forward the following conditions: (1) Pay off the back wages. (2) A dissolution fee of six months' wages per worker. (3) Give priority to hiring old workers when resuming operations. The representatives of the party and government agencies, together with the workers' representatives Hu Jinshan, Zhou Anshan, Qiao Jihe, Gu Yongquan, Gu Alin, Qian Shunmao, Yin Changlin, Wu Junhui, Tao Baoyu, etc., and the company manager Shen Hegao and liquidator accountant Jiang Wanping, negotiated a solution. It was decided that (1) the wages for the second half of August and the 70% of the wages owed in March would be paid on August 31. (2) The dissolution fee, etc., will be mediated by the party and government agencies in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday's Back Wages Were Paid Yesterday, all the public buses on all routes in Shanghai Nanshi were still completely suspended. All the workers gathered at the intersection of Xiexu Road and Jumen Road. The order in the factory was maintained by the Public Security Bureau police. Fan Guoren from the Party Headquarters went to the factory to monitor the company's payment of back wages to all the workers. It was not completed until 5:00 p.m. At the same time, the representatives of the party and government agencies advised the workers to return after receiving their back wages. The Social Affairs Bureau decided to formally mediate the dissolution fee, etc., in the shortest possible time and ordered them to elect responsible representatives to wait for the summons. As a result, the workers were satisfied and dispersed.</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Decided on Two Principles for the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>The Result of Summoning Labor and Management for Questioning Yesterday</p>
<p>The Employer Promised to Consider and Respond Tomorrow</p>
<p>All the workers of the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory opposed the factory's management rules, causing a serious labor unrest. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau specifically summoned both labor and management for questioning at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Li Deque and Cao Yunxiang, representatives of the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory, Gu Ruofeng and Chen Peide, representatives of the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Trade Union, Chairman Wang Gang, and Recorder Wang Zhongqin, first reported on the labor side's submission regarding this case, requesting (1) that the factory implement the Factory Law, (2) that the various established measures of the labor-capital contract be revised, and (3) that the management rules established by the factory be revised. The employer stated that if there are any inappropriate points, they can be revised first through proper procedures. The labor side stated that the rules established by the factory conflict with the Factory Law and the labor-capital contract, and the factory's facts are still in conflict with the management rules themselves. The employer also said that if the facts of the conflict are pointed out, the factory can correct them. As for the factory rules, if they are inappropriate in themselves, they can also be revised. After a long period of debate between labor and management, the chairman finally decided on two principles: (1) The trade union and the factory should both abide by the current labor laws and regulations. (2) The factory's usual methods of treating workers should still be followed if they are superior to the current laws and regulations. All relations between labor and management should be examined based on the above two principles. If there are any violations, they will be revised. The labor side was satisfied, and the employer promised to consider and respond at 9:00 a.m. on Friday.</p>
<h3>The Labor Unrest of the Chafang of the Datong Vessels</h3>
<p>Due to Filling Out Application Forms and Searching for Guarantees Again</p>
<p>The Middle Cabin Guild Petitioned Yesterday</p>
<p>The Chafang of the Datong Renji Shipping Company's Zhida, Longda, Zhengda, and Hongda vessels launched a labor unrest due to opposing the company's forcing them to fill out application forms. The Middle Cabin Guild petitioned the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Cause of the Labor Unrest The Datong Company announced that all the Chafang of each vessel must fill out application forms and search for guarantees again. All the workers believed that according to the usual practice of sailors across the country, there is no need to fill out application forms. The Datong Company's announcement this time clearly violates past practices. Moreover, the so-called compliance with the company's new regulations in the application form has not been approved by the government in advance, and it has not been announced to the workers. They unanimously refused to express it. As for the guarantees that have already been deposited in the company, there is no reason to search for them again. They requested assistance from the Shanghai Branch of the Seamen's Association and the Seamen's Middle Cabin Guild. The Shanghai Branch took on the task of mediation to no avail.</p>
<p>▲Workers Petitioned The Seamen's Middle Cabin Guild yesterday sent representatives Zhou Xiaoting, Jiao Langcai, Gao Yongliu, Qian Ziyun, and Zhang Heyun to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to petition, requesting that the company be stopped from forcing workers to fill out application forms. Zhu Guilin, mediator of the Third Section, received them. Regarding the workers' request, he promised to accept it and convey it to the section chief. It was decided to send personnel to cooperate with the Municipal Party Headquarters to find a solution before September 2. The representatives were satisfied and returned. It is heard that the bureau has scheduled personnel to cooperate with the Municipal Party Headquarters to conduct a thorough investigation this afternoon in order to verify and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Ye Gongchuo Talks About Responsible Transportation</h3>
<p>The Road and Business Sides Should Discuss Openly and Frankly</p>
<p>The Railway Should Be Fully Prepared</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways has promulgated the General Rules for Responsible Transportation of Railways, which will be implemented starting today. Yu Zha, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, came to Shanghai the other day to host people from all walks of life and report on the significance of responsible transportation. The business community has been discussing it frequently in recent days. The reporter believes that this matter is of great importance, so he visited Ye Gongchuo, a senior figure in the transportation industry, to ask for his opinion on responsible transportation. Ye published his views as follows: Ye said that responsible transportation by railways is a common practice in the world. Due to various reasons, some of our country's roads have already implemented it, while others have not. However, in terms of the current world trend, all roads across the country should be handled uniformly. However, before implementation, considerable preparation should be made so that customers do not feel inconvenienced and misunderstandings are not caused. It seems that many road employees are concerned about implementing responsible transportation. But in the case of the Beining and Jiaoji roads, the handling of responsible transportation has not been found to have any adverse results. At the beginning of the Beining Road's implementation, the road employees were very worried about compensating for losses, fearing that the number would be too large and the railway would not be able to bear it. But as a result, the average compensation in a year was only more than 10,000 yuan. In my opinion, no matter what kind of business, it is inevitable that there will be small conflicts of interest at the beginning of the implementation. For the sake of the future of the business, any party should put aside interests and assist in its progress. When the General Rules for Responsible Transportation of Railways promulgated by the Ministry of Railways this time, or when a certain road has special circumstances, special regulations can be made in the implementation rules to make it suitable for the situation of each road in order to facilitate progress. Ordinary merchants often suffer from the complexity of the laws and regulations promulgated by the government, so they lack research, and many benefits are obtained by third parties. In my opinion, it is best for merchants to directly discuss with the railway each other openly and frankly. For points that are considered obstacles, it may be discussed and studied to remove these obstacles. At the same time, the railway should also step up and fully prepare the things that must be prepared, such as vehicles, warehouses, docks, etc. Although the railway finances are currently difficult to the extreme, the railway's subsidy for the circulation of goods must not be neglected. Responsible transportation is a very legitimate business. If you want to do it well and want to have satisfactory results, road employees should also make great efforts. If it is said that the business community opposes it, in my opinion, it may be a temporary misunderstanding. Responsible transportation is a very common thing, and other roads have considerable experience, and there is no obstacle to speak of.</p>
<h3>Important News Regarding Responsible Transportation</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Railway Department Explaining to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Various Industries Plan Water Transportation Methods</p>
<p>▲Railway Department Responds to Chamber of Commerce via Telegram The Railway Department responded via telegram yesterday to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's request to revise the articles on responsible transportation, explaining: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, your telegram has been received and understood. We have examined the issue of responsible transportation, which is a sound strategy for organizing railway transport and benefiting merchants. It was previously announced by the Ministry of Communications in the tenth year of the Republic of China, with a 10% surcharge on freight rates on record. The current implementation by the Tianjin-Pukou and Shanghai-Nanjing railways requires substantial funding, such as for adding equipment, increasing staff, and compensating for cargo losses. The costs are considerable, and since railway costs have already increased, the 10% surcharge for responsible transport is, in reality, too low to cover costs. The Chamber's submissions are presumably based on misunderstandings. As for the method of charging priority and top-priority freight fees, it is purely for the convenience of merchants. The railway service is entirely for the community, aiming for fast transportation and eliminating the long-standing problem of private sales of railcars. The method is extremely sound. If merchants do not require urgent transportation, the original price still applies, and there is no issue. The railways are not forcing anyone. The Ministry's reception for representatives from all sectors at the Shanghai Banking Association on the 28th was for informational purposes, not to convene a meeting. The request for item-by-item discussion is unnecessary. If businesses have other questions, they can submit them in writing to the Ministry for review. Please comply accordingly." Railway Minister Gu Mengyu.</p>
<p>▲Planning Water Transportation According to a leader in the transportation industry who spoke to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, since the January 28th Incident, railway transportation has been disrupted for a long time, and the interior is also affected by the war, causing extreme economic hardship. Therefore, as soon as the war stopped, goods were shipped to Shanghai for sale. At that time, railway transport was not available, so all goods were transported by ship. After unloading, ships immediately sought cargo to carry back, and the prices were very low, only two-thirds of the railway freight rates. As a result, railway freight has not yet recovered to its former state. Now, the Railway Department wants to increase freight revenue, but instead of reducing freight rates to attract business, it is using responsible transport to promote the development of water transport. This is a mistake. Transportation companies are purely intermediaries and are not greatly affected by changes in freight rates. However, various industries are finding railway transport too expensive and are switching to water transport. The livelihoods of transportation companies are at stake, so they have to engage in water transport to survive. Therefore, a joint meeting of the North and South City Public Associations was held today to discuss concrete measures, and it was decided to work jointly with various stations along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways. As for the comparison of water transport and rail transport in terms of time, except for the Zhenjiang-Nanjing section of the Shanghai-Nanjing line, where water transport takes one day longer, the difference is very small. If merchants still wish to have their goods transported by rail, transportation companies will load them without exception, and will not use water transport to resist the railways.</p>
<p>▲Letter Questioning the Director of Business Affairs Yu Chengzhi, the Director of Business Affairs of the Railway Department, mentioned the large profits of transportation companies and their impact on current freight rates during a reception for various sectors in Shanghai to explain responsible transportation. The Shanghai Transportation Trade Association sent a letter of inquiry yesterday to clarify the truth. The original letter reads: "Regarding Article 4, Items 1, 2, and 3 of the explanatory statement made by our Director at the reception for various sectors to explain responsible transportation: 'On the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, the railway freight for one car of 20 tons of goods from Tianjin to Beiping is 140 yuan. If handled by a transportation company, they charge 200 yuan. On the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the railway freight for 40 tons of fourth-class goods from Nanjing to Shanghai is 90 yuan 55 fen. If handled by a transportation company, they charge 132 yuan 72 fen. The railway freight for 21 tons of flour from the Nanjing wharf to Machen Road in Shanghai is 46 yuan 37 fen. If handled by a transportation company, they charge 92 yuan,' and he claimed that this was the truth obtained from investigations, reciting it repeatedly. We are extremely shocked. Although it is true that industry representatives incur costs for reporting, transporting, loading, and unloading on behalf of customers, and should be compensated, the fact that they charge so much more than the railway's freight rates is unheard of unless there are special circumstances. If this is true, not only should our Director condemn it, but these individuals are also the moths of the industry, deeply hated by all members of the industry and should be punished to serve as a warning. Since the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway is outside the scope of our association, and we cannot reach it, we will not inquire about it. However, the second and third items, which occurred on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, greatly damage the reputation and credibility of all members of our association. Moreover, there is also legal responsibility to be borne. The truth must be thoroughly investigated. Since our Director claims that it is the truth obtained from investigations, he must have absolute evidence. We dare to ask that he quickly provide two copies of this evidence, transcribed in full, and send them to us by a specific date so that we can investigate the matter and take appropriate action, and to demonstrate our Director's impartial and responsible sincerity. We are extremely eager to receive clarification."</p>
<h3>A Hand Grenade Exploded at the Sino-American Watch Company Last Night</h3>
<p>Glass Windows Were Destroyed</p>
<p>Fortunately, No One Was Injured</p>
<p>The Sino-American Watch and Optical Company at 389 Nanjing Road has been in business for many years and has a good reputation in the industry. The company's manager, Dong Zixing, is also an executive committee member of the industry association. Last night, it was reported that the store was bombed, but the thrower was not caught. According to eyewitnesses, around 8:00 PM, as the store employees were taking the clocks and watches displayed in the shop and glass cabinets on both sides to the warehouse, other stores had not yet closed, so the road was very busy. There were many cars traveling on the road. Suddenly, a black object was thrown from a car heading west toward the company. The car did not stop and drove straight west. At the time, the employees were gathered around a round table behind the middle glass cabinet, so they did not notice the object flying in from behind. They only became aware when they heard a loud explosion, and shards of metal flew everywhere, filling the room with sulfur gas. At the same time, the glass windows on the left, right, and middle cabinets were completely destroyed. However, the object thrown was a hand grenade, and the explosive power was relatively weak, so no one was injured. Only one customer was slightly injured on the heel and immediately went to the hospital. The explosion was very loud, and the Zhabei Police Station rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. After questioning the manager, they collected all the remaining metal fragments and kept them for the record. The company's losses were minor.</p>
<h3>Summary of Volume IV of the Feetham Report</h3>
<p>Volume IV of Judge Feetham's report has now been printed in English by the Public Works Department. The content of this volume is almost entirely devoted to a discussion of the internal administrative procedures of the Public Works Department. The research covers the improvement of the committee system, the powers of the Finance Committee, the appointment and powers of auditors, the term of office and qualifications of directors, and the protection of the status of employees in the bureau, etc. A summary of the contents of this volume is given below:</p>
<p>▲Committee System Should Be Improved Judge Feetham believes that if the number of directors is increased to more than 22 or even 30 in the future, the way the board of directors handles affairs must be changed. Even now, before the number of directors is increased, there are still areas that can be reformed. The current way of conducting business does not emphasize formal procedures, and the benefits of the committee system have not been fully realized. At present, committees conduct preliminary considerations of matters and record their conclusions and recommendations, which are then sent to the board of directors. Committees themselves have no administrative power, so everything must be decided by the board of directors, and the benefits of decentralization have not been seen. However, many of the current committee members are not directors but are hired by the bureau because of their knowledge, experience, or relationships. Since committee members are not all directors, they are restricted by the Land Regulations, and the committee cannot have executive power and can only be in an advisory position.</p>
<p>▲Administrative Officers Have Slightly More Power Since committees do not have administrative power, the current affairs of the board of directors are not particularly important. Generally, the chief officers of the various administrative departments, as well as the Director-General and the Chief Financial Officer, are customarily responsible for handling all routine matters without having to consult the board of directors on everything. However, matters related to administrative policy must await the guidance of the board of directors. However, the distinction between what is routine and what relates to policy is mostly determined by the chief administrative officers themselves. Therefore, the power of the committees is rather limited, while the power of the administrative officers is relatively great. However, the power of the administrative officers is still limited by the following two factors: first, the Director-General has general jurisdiction, and the Chief Financial Officer also has financial supervisory power; second, according to custom and precedent, the Chairman of the Board also has the power to personally supervise. In recent times, the Chairman of the Board has spent a large amount of time in the bureau every day, and the Chairman is often re-elected, so the Chairman has become the link between the administrative officers and the board of directors, and his position has become more important. However, despite the above-mentioned restrictions, there is still the danger that the actions of the administrative officers will occasionally be inconsistent with the views and policies of the board of directors, and that committee members will become alienated from the matter. In the current system, the influence of individual personalities is too great. The committee system should be developed as a safeguard for administration. This does not mean depriving administrative officers of their freedom of action, but the board of directors is responsible to the voters, so the board of directors must be able to supervise the administration of each department well. Regarding the number of committees, Judge Feetham proposes establishing five or six standing committees (the Library and Music Committee would be changed to a special committee) to replace the current eight committees. Their powers should be clearly defined in writing and divided into executive and advisory categories. Regular meetings should be held once every two weeks to reduce the need for circulars. The minutes of the committees should be prepared as separate reports to be submitted to the board of directors for processing and should be made public. As for the number of hired committee members, it should be fixed and not exceed one-third of the total number.</p>
<p>▲Auditors Should Be Clearly Defined The Public Concession Land Regulations stipulate that audits should be conducted and reported to the annual meeting, but there are no regulations on how auditors should be selected, their remuneration, protection, qualifications, and powers. Judge Feetham's recommendations are: (1) The audit should be clearly stipulated as a regular practice; (2) Auditors must be legally qualified persons, and directors and employees of the bureau should not be appointed; (3) If Chinese and foreign taxpayers hold separate meetings in the future, each meeting should elect an auditor; (4) The qualifications of candidates for auditor should be reviewed in advance, and their salaries should be determined by the bureau; (5) Auditors should serve for at least three years; (6) Auditors must have sufficient power to perform their duties; (7) The Transvaal system should be used as a reference to specify the format of the auditor's certificate.</p>
<p>▲Qualifications and Restrictions of Directors According to the Public Concession Land Regulations, only a property qualification is required to serve as a director. However, according to municipal common practice in various places, there are restrictions on who may not serve as a director. The current practice in the Public Concession is that employees of the bureau cannot be elected, because bureau employees are exempt from paying taxes and therefore have no right to vote. If the number of directors is increased in the future and the term of office is extended to two years, the qualifications should be further defined in writing. In addition, if a director is frequently absent or unable to attend meetings for a long time due to various reasons, they should be asked to resign. Also, if the matter under discussion is related to the director's personal financial interests, they should be asked to recuse themselves. There are currently no clear written rules, and it is inconvenient to consider whether or not they should recuse themselves on a case-by-case basis. However, this system of recusal should not be too strict, otherwise, honest businessmen may regard the position of director as a daunting task and be reluctant to take on the responsibility. The only way to remedy this is to make the bureau's contracts with businesses public, which can prevent abuses.</p>
<p>▲Powers of the Finance Committee Should Be Increased Judge Feetham believes that the powers of the Finance Committee should be formally defined so that all important financial measures are discussed by the committee before a report is prepared and submitted to the board of directors. If the system of taxpayer annual meetings is changed in the future, the budget may be finally decided by the board of directors. The Finance Committee must have the power to review the estimated expenditures approved by other committees, the total amount of expenditures, the types of taxes to be levied, and how the revenue should be allocated to various projects. After the budget is approved, the Finance Committee should still supervise each department to prevent overspending and misuse. Under the current system, the power to supervise the use of funds lies with the Chief Financial Officer, but in municipal governments throughout the United Kingdom, the Finance Committee plays a very important role in financial supervision and prior planning. The current Finance Committee rarely meets except to discuss the budget. It should be made to meet regularly throughout the year, and the relationship between the Chief Financial Officer and the committee should be made closer.</p>
<p>▲Permanent Employees Should Be Further Protected Under the current system, bureau employees cannot obtain pensions by law, because employees are limited to three-year contracts, and the bureau has the power to dismiss employees with six months' notice, so employees may not be able to obtain pensions based on their years of service. The Land Regulations should be amended to promote this system, so that employees' service can be permanently guaranteed. As employees of public institutions, it is difficult to ensure that they will not offend public opinion or conflict with the interests of powerful private individuals when performing their duties. It is necessary to ensure their own positions so that they can be unyielding and abide by the law. This is not to protect the individual employees, but to protect the interests of the public. If there is a fundamental change in the administration of the Concession in the future, for the sake of administrative efficiency and the interests of employees, all retirees should be treated fairly, and a large number of experienced employees should be retained to continue all administration. In the current transition period, not only should Chinese be brought in to hold senior positions, but also sufficient qualified foreign employees should be retained and recruited. First, it should be stipulated that employees above a certain grade should be given permanent service after a certain period of probation. Second, an arbitration procedure should be established to judge disputes between the Public Security Bureau and employees. A recruitment committee should be established to recruit employees. All final decisions on issues related to the service of permanent employees, as well as the dismissal of certain employees, should be made by the committee. The committee can also decide whether or not to grant full pensions. If it is inconvenient for a large number of committee members to make a decision, the matter can be arbitrated by three people, one nominated by the bureau, one nominated by the relevant consul, and the other nominated jointly by the first two, or appointed by the committee. With such provisions, bureau employees will be protected.</p>

<h3>Son Illegally Imprisons His Own Mother</h3>
<p>Arising from Embezzlement of Property</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Mother Escaped by Breaking Through the Wall</p>
<p>Fu Zhang, a woman from Pudong, is 67 years old and lives at No. 5 Huazhanjiatang Bay. Recently, she hired Lawyer Dong to sue her eldest son, Fu Atao, at the District Court Prosecutor's Office for attempting to destroy evidence and illegally imprisoning a senior family member. The main points of her indictment are as follows: The plaintiff has four sons: the eldest son Atao (the defendant), the second son Fuxing, the third son Liubao, and the fourth son Qibao. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, they divided the real estate and land left by their late father, Quan Sheng, according to their respective shares and established a division agreement. However, they had two large ships in Shanghai that specialized in business with foreign firms such as Mei Foo and Ju An, which was quite prosperous. At that time, because Liubao and Qibao were still underage, it was agreed that the eldest son, Atao, and the second son, Fuxing, would manage them. Later, because Fuxing developed an eye disease, Atao was put in charge, with the understanding that after deducting expenses, the accumulated principal and interest would be divided equally among the four shares. Unexpectedly, Atao has been in charge for seven years and has accumulated more than 18,000 yuan in profit, but he has refused to divide it and listens to his wife's words, intending to embezzle it. Therefore, Fuxing, Liubao, and Qibao have filed a lawsuit in your court's civil court (the day before yesterday, the court ordered an out-of-court settlement after the hearing). Unexpectedly, Atao had malicious intentions. On the afternoon of the 20th of this month, at 3:00 PM, while the plaintiff was chatting at her son-in-law Jin Liusheng's house, Atao came to deceive the plaintiff into going to a lawyer's office, urging the plaintiff not to appear in court. The plaintiff was instructed to testify that because both parties were her own children, she should be fair to both sides. Unexpectedly, Atao became malicious and lured the plaintiff to his home for the night. The next morning, his wife and two daughters (the plaintiff's daughter-in-law and granddaughters) escorted the plaintiff to a house in Tangwang Bridge, Chuansha County, for illegal imprisonment. The plaintiff cried and made a lot of noise. In the evening, the plaintiff was escorted to a small room upstairs at Jin Chengkun's house in Yangjing, Pudong, for illegal imprisonment. The door was locked, and the plaintiff's body was not free, which lasted for a whole night. The next day, at around 5:00 AM, the plaintiff saw that the rear wall was broken and that the other guards were still asleep. The plaintiff broke through the wall and escaped, arriving at Liubao's house at 11:00 AM and regaining her freedom. Such illegal imprisonment of a direct relative constitutes a crime under Article 317, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. It is requested that Atao and his wife and daughters be arrested and dealt with according to the law. The prosecutor has ordered that each defendant be summoned to court for verification.</p>
<h3>National Anti-Drug Representative Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>Publishes Declaration</p>
<p>The National Anti-Drug Representative Conference held its second day of meetings yesterday at the Zhongshe Auditorium on Weihaiwei Road, with more than 100 representatives in attendance. First, Chairman Ge Baohang reported on the election procedures. Then, all the representatives in the venue, for the sake of caution regarding the election of important personnel, decided that the election should be changed to the afternoon. Subsequently, Secretary Li Fengchu of the Anti-Smoking Design Committee, Secretary Zhang Shengcai of the Economic Committee, Deputy Chairman Zhu Qiluo of the Tobacco Committee, Chairman Zhang Zhenliang of the Organization Committee, and Deputy Chairman Wu Zhenduo of the Education and Investigation Committee successively reported on the results of the review of the proposals yesterday. The proposals passed by each group, along with those reserved, were transferred to the Executive Committee for handling, which was unanimously approved by the venue. Then, the representatives voted by secret ballot to elect 15 executive committee members, including Wang Jingqi and Li Denghui, and more than 10 special committee members, including Xiong Xiling and Ma Yinchu. At around 6:00 PM, the closing ceremony of the conference was held. Ge Baohang delivered the closing speech, and the whole assembly dispersed after shouting slogans. The situation of this conference was very good. The proposals passed were all the most important tasks at present. In the future, they will be implemented in order, which will definitely contribute to the domestic anti-drug movement. The conference declaration is excerpted below: At this time, from August 29th to 31st, the 21st year of the Republic of China, the representatives, in view of the rampant drug scourge in the country, which has been spreading endlessly, and that it is not enough to quell the surging tide of opium without gathering the strength of the entire nation, the China National Anti-Drug Association initiated this conference, gathering more than 130 representatives from all over the country to seek strategies for future anti-drug movements. All of them were frank and open, calm and peaceful, and discussed only for the sake of what is right. They scrutinized without being tired of the details, willing to gather the opinions of the majority of groups and individuals to form a concrete plan for anti-drug efforts. A total of more than 90 proposals were submitted, and dozens of groups from all walks of life participated in the discussion. This is a glorious and grand occasion for the conference. The representatives dare to take comfort in this and briefly list them to comfort the people of the country. In the past, the reason why the people's anti-drug movement did not succeed completely was that the key was that the progress of each other was not connected, the voices were not communicated, and people fought on their own, so there was no concentrated force to respond to the rampant drug atmosphere. In the past, the reason why the domestic opium ban was abolished was also that the weakness was that the people were indifferent to this, did not give the authorities appropriate supervision and responsibility, and adopted a supportive attitude, which made those in power able to manipulate the situation and collude with each other. The so-called Chen Yan, who is wise to protect himself and ordinary people do not discuss, is a huge mistake for the people's anti-drug movement. The representatives punished themselves, made up for what they had done before, and felt that to complete the opium ban in our country, we must take the people's anti-drug movement as the main body, and the people's support and supervision is the policy of the government to implement the opium ban. The representatives do not believe that the Chinese people do not have the ability to assist the government, the spirit of unity, the ability to self-determination, and the endowment of civil rights. They dare to start from today, and through the deliberation and cooperation of the representatives from all parties at the meeting, they will use unified strength, orderly steps, and a hundred strategies, and the courage to go forward to carry out a total attack on opium and all anesthetic drugs. They hold the concept that if the drug is in me, I will die, and if I am in the drug, the drug will die. They issue a grand wish to benefit the world. If the poison is still rooted for a day, then the representatives have not fulfilled their responsibility for a day. Now, the voices of opium sales are sometimes loud and sometimes silent. The enemies who destroy the anti-drug work are ambushing around. It is the day when the representatives are restless and staring intently. If the opium ban authorities show an unstable attitude, we will vow to go to the death. If the destroyers have any harmful means, we will defend it with all our strength. We will depend on each other and never forget the sincerity of this day. We will work together and dare to forget the sincerity of this day. We must ensure that after this, every move and every word against drugs will not betray the sincere intention and mission of our participation in the conference today. It is clear above, and it is clear beside. If you break this word, you should abandon it together. The National Anti-Drug Representative Conference hereby declares.</p>
<h3>The Garrison Department Burned Opium Yesterday</h3>
<p>Held in the Backyard of the Department Yesterday</p>
<p>Commander Dai Ji Personally Supervised</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters burned the opium stored in the Military Law Office of the Headquarters in the open space in the backyard of the Longhua Headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday. The total amount was more than 1,100 taels. The Municipal Government, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the District Court, the First and Second Special District Courts, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent representatives to supervise. Garrison Commander Dai Ji, Chief of Staff Zhang Xiang, and Adjutant Lin Jing also personally supervised. More than 100 packages of opium were cut open and inspected to ensure that there were no mistakes before they were burned. At that time, Wang Yiji, the Director of the Military Law Office, reported the amount of opium sent by the Public Security Bureau, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Police Department, and other agencies from May 20 to August 22 of this year, one by one. The procedures were extremely cautious and were not completed until 2:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Changing Northeast Mail Delivery Methods</h3>
<p>Mail from Manchukuo will be verified and treated as underpaid postage. Post offices remain in operation in Heilongjiang Province, such as Daheihe. After the postal blockade of the Northeast, although the Directorate General of Posts has repeatedly revised the methods for delivering mail in the three eastern provinces and the South Manchuria Railway Zone, there were still omissions. Therefore, the Directorate General yesterday, after careful consideration, made further amendments and instructed the Shanghai Postal Administration to comply. Director Zha Peilin issued Bureau Edict No. 1651 yesterday, stating that regarding the methods for mail in the three eastern provinces and the South Manchuria Railway Zone, previous Bureau Edicts No. 1629 and No. 1639 have been notified. Now, according to the order of the Directorate General of Posts, the supplementary methods for mail in the three eastern provinces and the South Manchuria Railway Zone are listed as follows: (Mail from the three eastern provinces or the South Manchuria Railway Zone, posted in Dalian,) All types of mail, with obvious signs on the exterior indicating that they originated from the so-called Manchukuo or the South Manchuria Railway Zone and were forwarded to Dalian for posting, must be subject to a double penalty of postage according to domestic rates, regardless of whether the postage stamps affixed are Japanese postage stamps or not. However, it should be noted that this method of underpaid postage can only be applied to mail whose place of origin is definitely the false Manchukuo or the South Manchuria Railway Zone, without any doubt. If there is any doubt, the mail should not be treated as underpaid postage but should benefit the public. If the recipient sues due to underpaid postage and can prove that the original sending post office was indeed Dalian, the underpaid postage should be waived.

<h3>Two Approvals from the International Trade Association</h3>
<p>Agreeing to the principle that exported goods must be labeled with their country of origin.</p>
<p>Returning the import tax on rayon to the Ministry of Finance for consultation.</p>
<p>The China International Trade Association previously requested the Ministry of Industry to specify regulations and order all stores nationwide to label the country of origin of foreign goods they sell; otherwise, they would be severely punished. Now, Approval No. 13285 of the Ministry of Industry has been received, stating that the proposal has been noted. It is considered that it is essential to specify the country of origin and manufacturer of foreign goods sold in the domestic market for identification. Many countries have precedents. China, as a country with import surpluses, is flooded with foreign goods. The original proposal requested that stores be ordered to label the country of origin of foreign goods they sell so that buyers can make informed choices and businesses can have a reference. It has merit. However, at the same time, it is necessary to require that all imported foreign goods be labeled with their country of origin and be strictly inspected by customs to be effective. The association previously submitted the same request to the ministry, which has been sent to the Ministry of Finance for review. The issuance of certificates by consuls abroad is about to be implemented. If only customs restrictions are imposed, foreign merchants will inevitably object, citing consular certification. It is now proposed to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ordering consuls abroad to first consider this point when issuing visas and strictly instruct all foreign merchants to clearly label the country of origin, place of origin, or manufacturer on the packaging of goods and to conduct inspections or clearly specify it in the certificate to prevent omissions. Before the aforementioned measures are fully implemented, the request to order all stores nationwide to label the country of origin should be handled properly by chambers of commerce and trade associations in an autonomous manner to the extent possible. If the government specifies laws and strictly enforces them, there may be obstacles. In addition to consulting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct consuls abroad to pay attention to the conspicuous labeling of the country of origin, place of origin, and manufacturer on the packaging of goods and to strictly limit foreign countries to comply, you are hereby notified, etc. Furthermore, the association's request, forwarded by the Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association, to return the import tax on rayon fabrics and rayon interwoven raw materials exported abroad has also been approved by the Ministry of Industry, stating that it has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review.</p>

<p>Wang Yiting Allocates 10,000 Yuan for Relief Funds</p>
<p>Remitted to Xiong Bingsan to be Distributed by Li Fenggang</p>
<p>Outer Mongolian refugees are in urgent need of relief. Previously, Commissioner Shi Qingyang of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission came to Shanghai to implore leaders of various charitable organizations in the city to raise funds. Now, Wang Yiting and other gentlemen have raised 10,000 yuan for relief, which will be remitted in batches to Mr. Xiong Bingsan of the Red Swastika Society in Peiping, to be distributed by Representative Li Fenggang. Two letters and telegrams regarding this matter are disclosed below:</p>

<h3>Xu Tingyao Inquires About Relief Funds for Huo Qiu</h3>
<p>Huo Qiu should have received 60,000 to 70,000 yuan in relief funds for northern Anhui last year.</p>
<p>The county was occupied by bandits, and the funds were not distributed, so they should still exist.</p>
<p>Commander Xu Tingyao of the Fourth Army Division recently recovered Huo Qiu and is planning for local rehabilitation. He repeatedly telegraphed for relief and telegraphed Commissioner Xu Shiying of the Central Relief Commission, stating that the National Government's Flood Relief Committee allocated over one million yuan to northern Anhui last year, to be distributed among 21 counties. Huo Qiu should have received 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, but because the county was occupied by bandits, the funds were not distributed. This relief money should still exist. Please send someone to distribute it as soon as possible, etc. Commissioner Xu, regarding the aforementioned relief funds, inquired with the National Government Disaster Relief Working Group and simultaneously telegraphed Quan Shaowu, Commissioner of the Northern Anhui Relief Office, to investigate how much relief money was allocated to Huo Qiu, to whom the money was given, and whether there was any remaining money, and where it is now. He then received a telegram from Quan Shaowu, stating the facts of the distribution and stating that the money was received by Wang Junbao. As for how it was distributed and whether there was any remaining relief, please inquire with Wang Jun nearby for details. Commissioner Xu then forwarded Quan's telegram and inquired with Wang Jun. It is now heard that Wang Junbaozhai has already responded. The original text of the telegram is disclosed below for reference by those concerned about relief in northern Anhui. Wang Zhuren (i.e., Baozhai) telegraphed, (omitted above) Yesterday, I received a telegram from Bengbu forwarded from Fengyang. I understand everything. On May 22, I went to Bengbu for business, just when the county seat of Huo Qiu was occupied. Refugees from Huo Qiu fled to various places, without food or shelter, and starved to death on the roads. I was heartbroken at the time and immediately thought of ways to provide relief. For several months, I have been running around and consulting with the Northern Anhui Office, receiving a total of 26,000 yuan in relief and 185 tons of relief wheat. After repeated meetings with various fellow villagers, we investigated and distributed emergency relief in Bengbu for the first time with 2,612 and a half bags of American flour (i.e., relief wheat). The second time, we distributed approximately 8,000 yuan in foreign currency (the American hemp was not enough, so it was sold at the current price), 7,000 yuan in Gushi, 4,000 yuan in Yingshang, 8,700 yuan in Chuzhou, Quanjiao, and Laian, 400 yuan in Fuyang, 3,300 yuan in Huaiyuan, Fengtai, Shouxian, Fengyang, and Wuhe, and 1,000 yuan in Hefei, for a total of more than 32,000 yuan. Currently, the distributors in Gushi and Hefei have not returned, so the exact amount cannot be calculated. It is estimated that there are still more than 2,000 yuan left, which is intended to be distributed to the refugees in Huo Qiu who have not escaped. The previous time, I entrusted Commissioner Zhang Zepu to bring the remaining relief money to Huo Qiu for distribution, and he has agreed. In addition to sending a letter to Commander Xu for verification, I hereby reply, Wang Zhuren kowtows.</p>
<h3>Municipal and County Accumulated Grain and Public Property to be Sold at Auction</h3>
<p>Estimated value of over 430,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of dividing the accumulated grain and property originally belonging to Shanghai County between the Shanghai Municipality and County, the Real Estate Evaluation Committee has been organized, and Wei Xinyi and others are responsible for surveying and estimating. It has been found that over 100,000 yuan of the cash portion of the accumulated grain and property has been taken by former Military Governor He for military use, so little remains. As for the real estate portion, after detailed surveying and estimation by Commissioner Gu and others, excluding the roads that have been built and those related to charity, the land and buildings are worth over 430,000 yuan. It has now been decided to sell them by public auction, and the proceeds will be divided according to the proportion between the municipality and the county to ensure fairness.</p>
<h3>Postponement of Opening of the Qian Industry Reserve</h3>
<p>The Qian Industry Reserve organized by the Shanghai Qian Industry Association has been preparing for nearly a month. The address has been selected at the old site of the Jiangnan Bank, and construction and renovation are currently underway. The original resolution to open on September 1 (i.e., today) has been postponed due to the urgency of time and the inability to complete the preparations in time, and the renovation will still take time. It is now learned that the internal arrangements will be made by gathering the staff on the 15th of this month, and the opening will definitely be possible around October 1.</p>
<h3>News from the Wenzhou-Chu Salt Affairs Improvement Association</h3>
<p>The Wenzhou-Chu Salt Affairs Improvement Association recently received letters from various legal entities in the two prefectures, requesting that the auditing office immediately execute the Ministry's order, strictly pursue illegal levies, and revoke permits. Because Wang is now actively lobbying to put the Ministry's order on hold, the people are indignant. The Yongjia County Party Department has sent a letter to the Provincial Government, clearly expressing this.</p>

<h3>Significant Decline in Epidemic Situation Last Week</h3>
<p>Report by Wu Liande</p>
<p>Wu Liande, Director of the Seaport Quarantine Office and Director of the Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office, issued the 14th Cholera Weekly Report yesterday (August 31). The following is a record: (1) According to records from the end of last week (August 27), a total of only 258 cholera cases were reported in one week, which is a significant decrease compared to the previous week's 347 cases. The cholera epidemic has been greatly reduced. The locations where cholera was found last week are listed below:</p>
<p>Area Cases Deaths</p>
<p>Shanghai City 75 2</p>
<p>International Settlement 20 (including 3 foreigners) 12 (including 2 foreigners)</p>
<p>French Concession 92 (including 1 foreigner) 3</p>
<p>Unknown Area 2 0</p>
<p>Total for Last Week 258 (including 4 foreigners) 17 (including 2 foreigners)</p>
<p>Previous Total 3714 (including 66 foreigners) 272 (including 17 foreigners)</p>
<p>Total 3972 (including 70 foreigners) 290 (including 19 foreigners)</p>
<p>(2) As of the end of last week, approximately 4,000 cases of cholera have been discovered, including 70 foreigners, with 290 deaths, including 19 foreigners. From this, it can be inferred that 3,902 Chinese people have contracted cholera, with 271 deaths, meaning the cholera mortality rate for Chinese people is 6.9%. 70 foreigners contracted cholera, with 19 deaths, meaning the cholera mortality rate for foreigners is 27.1%. (3) The cholera epidemic in Shanghai is indeed showing a trend of disappearing. This can be inferred from the recent situation of the clinics in various epidemic hospitals. The beds in the hospitals are mostly vacant, especially in the Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital. The hospital can accommodate more than 3,000 beds, and since the cholera outbreak, the number of patients treated has been countless. (4) According to reports from various seaports, the cholera trend in those ports is also showing the same reduction. For example, for the weekend of August 20, Xiamen reported 97 cholera cases, with 21 deaths, Guangzhou 7 cases, with 2 deaths, Hankou 113 cases, with 20 deaths, Shantou 49 cases, with 11 deaths, Tanggu 2 cases, with 1 death, Tianjin 1 case, and Nanjing reported 93 cases, with 7 deaths for the weekend of August 27. (5) Qingdao, despite strict prevention, was also invaded by cholera on July 11. As of August 20, a total of 52 cholera cases have been discovered, with 10 deaths, compared to 18 cases and 4 deaths in the previous week. (6) Autumn has arrived, the epidemic has decreased, and those who serve in cholera epidemic hospitals and laboratories or run around providing treatment in cholera epidemic areas can now rest after their hard work in the past. Shanghai is a large city with a large population, and this tiger epidemic was able to pass smoothly, achieving such good results. This is all thanks to the proper handling by the health authorities. Therefore, although there is a large area with a population of 3.5 million, the cholera mortality rate is only 7%, which is truly rare and worthy of research.</p>
<h3>Four People Released in Lizhong Lane Murder Case</h3>
<p>On August 2, a carpenter was beaten to death and two other Chinese were stabbed by Indians in Lizhong Lane, Yuezhou Road. Five Indians were arrested on the spot. Except for one who was formally arrested after preliminary hearing and handed over to the British Chief Justice's Office for trial, and two who were released without charge, there were two remaining, Ali Hait and Mao Huasihan. They were also brought to trial by the British Consulate Police Court a few days ago. The acting trial officer Maurice found that the defendant's actions were in self-defense and ordered their release.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Association Endorses Silk Fabric Appraisal Method</h3>
<p>Raw material registration will be organized, and the association will be responsible for guaranteeing it.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association has a positive opinion regarding the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry's silk fabric appraisal method. It has specifically notified its members that raw material registration will begin on September 1, and appraisal will be implemented as soon as the procedures are completed. The original letter is recorded below: Dear Sirs, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, stating that in order to promote domestically produced silk fabrics and facilitate the public's understanding of quality, our bureau plans to implement silk fabric appraisal in the shortest possible time. We are sending you six articles of the appraisal rules, mimeographed, for your reference. It has been found that silk fabric appraisal is indeed the only way to prove domestic goods, and the bureau's stamping of seals on both ends of the fabric will further facilitate public recognition of quality. The method is good and well-intentioned. At a time when inferior goods are filling the market and causing confusion, appraising silk fabrics to prove domestic goods is a matter of great urgency. All of our members should enthusiastically accept it. Therefore, our association has convened an executive committee meeting, unanimously approved, and decided that before the bureau implements the appraisal, our association must first organize the raw material registration work for the members. After this procedure is completed, we can complete the request form and request appraisal in accordance with the rules, guaranteed by our association. It is scheduled from September 1st to 5th as the period for registering raw materials in stock. All members must, within these five days, combine the warp and weft raw materials in stock as of August 31st, including those on the machine and sizing silk, verify them, fill out a form, and send it to the association. From September 1st onwards, future purchases of raw materials must be reported to the association before the transaction is completed, and the association will fill out the certificate for registration. Otherwise, if they are concealed and not reported, the association will not be responsible for any external inquiries in the future. This matter is related to promoting domestic goods, business interests, and has a great impact. Please pay close attention and do not delay, lest you regret it later. In addition to the attached copy of the appraisal rules, inventory raw material registration form, and volunteer form, we are sending this letter accordingly. Please refer to it. Attached (Silk Fabric Appraisal Rules of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry) Article 1: In order to promote domestically produced silk fabrics and facilitate the public's understanding of their quality, this bureau has specially formulated these rules to implement silk fabric appraisal. Article 2: The products of silk weaving factories within the borders of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces must be appraised by this bureau to determine whether they are purely domestic genuine silk fabrics or interwoven fabrics of genuine silk and rayon, etc. After the appraisal, this bureau will stamp seals on both ends of the fabric to prove it. After the silk fabric is appraised by this bureau, when it is rolled, one end with the seal should be exposed to the outside so that buyers can easily recognize it. Article 3: In addition to sending personnel to be stationed in various refineries to carry out appraisal procedures, each factory may send its products to this bureau for appraisal. Article 4: Each factory requesting appraisal of silk fabrics must fill out a request form with a duplicate, and report to this bureau with a guarantee from the industry association. Those who transport their products to the bureau for appraisal will be implemented in order of priority. Article 5: This bureau will charge a handling fee of one cent per piece for appraising silk fabrics, regardless of their quality and price. Article 6: These rules will be implemented from the date of promulgation by bureau order upon approval by the bureau.</p>
<h3>Zhabei No. 1 Public Bus Route Resumes Service Today</h3>
<p>From 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>The Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company suffered heavy losses during the Shanghai incident. However, all shareholders are making every effort to restore service in order to maintain transportation. In addition to resuming service on Route 3 from the North Station to Zhenru, Route 1 from the North Station to Jiangwan could not operate due to the slow withdrawal of Japanese soldiers from Zone D and the bombing of road bridges. Now that the Japanese soldiers have withdrawn, the Public Utilities Bureau has instructed that the roads traversed by the public buses can be fully repaired by the end of this month and ordered a speedy resumption. Manager Huang Zhongwen immediately prepared vehicles and decided to resume service from today. Temporary vehicles are prepared, one every twenty minutes. The first bus departs from the North Station at 6:00 AM, and the last bus returns from Jiangwan at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Air Transport Implemented Today</h3>
<p>The China Sin Kee Land, Sea and Air Transportation Company, with air transport as its main business, has a special contract with the China National Aviation Corporation, and the company exclusively manages air transport matters. In addition to air transport, the company also provides (1) cargo handling, (2) cargo sales, (3) collection of payment for goods to meet the major needs of various national goods factories. Detailed regulations have been printed to welcome inquiries from all sectors. It is scheduled to open today and begin air cargo transportation. The company has branch offices in major commercial ports on the Shanghai-Sichuan line of the China National Aviation Corporation: Nanjing, Anqing, Jiujiang, Hankou, Shashi, Yichang, Wanxian, and Chongqing. The service is thorough and the procedures are fast.</p>
<h3>The People's Sanatorium Opens Today</h3>
<p>Physician Mou Hongyi and others, in view of the increasing population of Shanghai and the scarcity of hospitals, and the fact that they are either too luxurious or too simple, so that people below the middle class often have no suitable hospital to enter when they become ill, have opened the People's Sanatorium in the four-story Western-style building on Weihaiwei Road, Chongqing Road. The air is fresh, facing Jingjin and adjacent to the garden, which is very suitable for sanatoriums. The sanatorium is equipped with various latest electrotherapy equipment and various wards with low prices. Outpatient clinics only charge a registration fee of two jiao, and no consultation fee is charged, in order to benefit the common people. The internal decoration has been completed and it officially opens today.</p>
<h3>Judgment in the Yuanshenghao Appeal Case</h3>
<p>Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>Yuanshenghao is a well-known securities firm in Shanghai. The general manager, Shi Zian, colluded with the former manager of the China Exchange Bank, Tian Hongnian, to embezzle and misappropriate funds, resulting in a loss of over 240,000 yuan. At the end of last year, shareholders Yu Shouzheng, Luo Kunxiang, and others filed a lawsuit in the first instance, and the verdict was rendered a month ago, establishing the crime of breach of trust. However, only a fine of 1,000 yuan was imposed on each of them. The plaintiffs were dissatisfied and appealed, while the defendants considered the fine a victory and made no indication of any kind. Judge Yu Hua presided over the case. In addition to slightly questioning the facts determined in the original trial, he also summoned the managing director of the China Exchange Bank to testify. The bank elected Yao Yong as their representative to testify in court, stating that the loan to Yuansheng was entirely the decision of Tian Hongnian alone, and the board of directors had never agreed to it beforehand, which was quite unfavorable to the defendants. The appellate trial consisted of two court sessions and then declared the debate closed. The plaintiffs' lawyers were Zhang Shizhao, Dong Kang, and Peng Yuanxun, while the defendants' defense lawyers were Yuan Yang'an and Zhu Fengchi. The arguments on both sides were very激烈 (intense/heated). Yesterday (i.e., August 31), at 8:00 AM, Judge Yu ascended to the first courtroom and announced the verdict, rescinding the sentencing portion of the original verdict. Shi Zian was sentenced to imprisonment for continuous breach of trust and fined 500 yuan. Tian Hongnian was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for joint breach of trust and fined 300 yuan. If they fail to pay, they will be subject to imprisonment at a rate of three yuan per day. This sensational breach of trust case has now come to an end in its second stage. Lawyer Zhang's appeal, regarding the overly lenient sentencing, contained a narrative tracing the origins of jurisprudence, which people referred to as an ancient-style pleading. A small newspaper published a short excerpt, and readers were surprised, saying that the citation of sources in the pleading was unprecedented. Lawyer Yuan Yang'an attacked in court, saying that Lawyer Zhang was abusing logic and not sticking to the facts, and that his thinking was outdated, constantly referring to the Three Dynasties, which seemed to be legal thinking that should not exist in the 20th century. This kind of legal battle writing, which is not often seen, is what the public is eager to see. Lawyer Dong's concise statement also contained many insightful remarks, such as saying that criminal law fraud, breach of trust, and general embezzlement are all treated the same, ending with a fine of 1,000 yuan, which is to give the judge the power to use it, not to leave it for perfunctory use. Moreover, the penalty of a fine, according to the explanatory memorandum of the 46th article of the Second Amendment, has been recognized as a minor penalty. This book has the same effect as this law, and the court cannot be unaware of it.] The wording is cold and refined, and deserves to be called a masterpiece. Due to the complexity of the words, I apologize for not recording them all.</p>
<h3>Change in Court Office Hours</h3>
<p>Due to the end of the summer vacation, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the First Special District District Court under its jurisdiction will change their office hours from September 1 (i.e., today) to 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily. The notice has been jointly issued by President Shen of the High Court and Chief Prosecutor Wang, and all litigants should be aware of this.</p>
<h3>Female Prison Guard Guilty of Accepting Bribes</h3>
<p>Sentenced to One Year and Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Mai Wen, a Cantonese man who worked as a gatekeeper at the women's prison in the First Special District, privately accepted a bribe of ten yuan on August 13th to deliver a package of opium to female prisoner Du Wen. The head female guard, Guo Huijun, reported this to the warden, who then reported it to the Mixed Court police. Mai was arrested, along with the opium, and sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Mai hired lawyer Wu Linkun to request leniency. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the case yesterday morning and sentenced the defendant, Mai Wen, to a reduced term of imprisonment of one year and six months. The package of opium was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Recaptures Accomplices in Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>To Be Tried Jointly with Previous Offenders After Postponement</p>
<p>The notorious kidnapping kingpin, Zheng Shifan, also known as Zheng Liantang, nicknamed "Big Brother," successively organized gangs last year to kidnap Qian Shanfu, the owner of Yongfeng Lumber Company in the French Concession's Pushi Road and Hehefang alleyway, and Pu Wenting, the manager of Fuxin Flour Mill at No. 19 Chenghe Village on Fuxu Road. He hid in a Western-style house at No. 9, Lane 601, Route Lafayette. It was not until the 16th of last month that Jin Jiulin, a special agent of the French police, along with detectives Zhang Ziyu and Li Yaolong, and other patrol officers, discovered and arrested Zheng, along with his accomplices Zhang Afu and Zhang Jiancheng. A pistol was seized, and they were sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Subsequently, accomplices Gao Atai, also known as "Cow Nose Big Brother," and Chen Lianglin were arrested in Wuxi and transferred to Shanghai. Zhao Xingsheng, who was related to the case, was also brought back from the First Special District Court to the police station for joint investigation. The case was originally scheduled to be heard yesterday. The police dispatched the detectives in charge of the case to escort Zheng and the other six defendants to the court. At 2:30 PM, Judge Xiong Huicui, accompanied by Clerk Tao Zongkan, presided over the hearing in the First Criminal Court. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer for the police, stated that the case was complex and the police investigation was not yet complete, requesting another postponement for further investigation. After a brief interrogation of the defendants by Judge Xiong, the request for postponement was granted. The defendants were temporarily detained in the police station.</p>
<h3>Abusing Maidservant Results in Eight Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Xu Changxian, a 50-year-old man from Pudong residing in a bungalow at the corner of Linqing Road and Hejian Road, adopted a nine-year-old girl named Ju Mei as his daughter last autumn for one hundred yuan in his hometown of Datuan. However, the girl suffered from enuresis, leading to Xu's frequent beatings. Early in the morning, around six o'clock, Xu beat Ju Mei again for no reason, causing injuries all over her body and swelling and bruising around her eyes. Ju Mei cried at the door, and a neighbor, Song Wanye from Jiangbei, couldn't bear to see it and reported it to Chinese Constable No. 848 at the nearby station. The constable arrested Xu and took him and Ju Mei to the Yangshupu Police Station. The police chief ordered Xu's detention, and Ju Mei was sent to the Jiliang Institute to await questioning. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, recounted the previous events and requested a severe sentence. Ju Mei, when questioned, was pale and emaciated, with severely bruised and swollen eyes. She kept her head down and dared not speak. The court asked how her eyes were injured, but she remained silent. The court told her not to be afraid, and she said she had been beaten with fists. A female staff member from the Jiliang Institute slightly rolled up her clothes, revealing severe scars on the girl's back and legs, which was heartbreaking to see. Xu confessed that because the girl wet the bed, he had only slightly scolded her, claiming her eyes were injured from bumping into something in her sleep. He had spent one hundred yuan to adopt her as an heir, hoping she would take care of him in his old age. He presented the purchase document and asked for consideration. Judge Fu Lin questioned him, stating that he had a wife and should not have brutally beaten the girl if she had done wrong, treating her like an animal. He added that if the girl grew up, he would make her a prostitute to make a living. The defendant lowered his head without a word, pleading for leniency. The police lawyer Zhang then stated that Ju Mei did not want to go home and wanted to study at the Jiliang Institute. Judge Fu then sentenced Xu Changxian to eight months of imprisonment as a warning. Ju Mei was sent to the Jiliang Institute for care.</p>
<h3>Verdict in Illegal Possession of Firearms Case</h3>
<p>According to a tip from Chen Sanbao, a Tongzhou native, to the French Concession Police's special task force, Chen Baoyuan and Zhao Haihai, both from Tongzhou, who rented and pulled rickshaws on Lujiabang Road in the South City, and Wang Xiaofu, from Jiangyin, who lived at No. 8, Renmei Lane, West New Bridge Street in the French Concession, were illegally possessing firearms and had committed robberies in the French Concession. The detectives arrested Chen and the other two and found a pistol in a pile of bricks outside Chen Baoyuan's house. They were taken to the Second Special District Court for questioning. Chen and the other two claimed they had never committed robbery and were ordered to be detained for investigation. Later, the police found out that Chen and the other two had a feud with Zhang Laobao, a Tongzhou native who also pulled a rickshaw and lived at No. 6 Lujiabang Road. Zhang had hidden the gun in the brick pile and incited Chen Sanbao to falsely report them. It was confirmed that Zhang and Chen had framed them. Zhang and Chen were arrested and taken to court for interrogation. The police charged Zhang and Chen with false accusation under Article 180 of the law. The court ordered Chen Baoyuan and the other two to be released. Zhang and Chen were held for sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Li Changnian presided over the First Criminal Court and sentenced Zhang Laobao to three years' imprisonment for falsely accusing others with the intent to subject them to criminal penalties, and six months' imprisonment for possessing military firearms, to be served concurrently for a total of three years and two months. Chen Sanbao was sentenced to one year and two months' imprisonment for falsely accusing others with the intent to subject them to criminal penalties. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed would be counted as two days for one day of imprisonment. The pistol was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Private Minting of Copper "Double Horns" Sentences Imposed</h3>

<h3>One Life Lost for One Dollar</h3>
<p>A Mediator's Hard Fate</p>
<p>Barge owners Chen Linhu and Wang Meifu, sailing together on a boat, collided with Ye Shenglin's barge near the Bund Beijing Road pier at 9:30 PM on the 23rd of last month. Chen and Wang's boat suffered minor damage, so they demanded compensation. After negotiation, Ye agreed to pay one dollar but did not have the money on hand. Gong Ronghua, a fellow barge owner acting as a mediator, agreed to lend the money. He gave one dollar to Ye to pass on to Wang. However, Wang later secretly asked Gong for the money directly. Gong replied that the money had already been given to Ye, so he could not pay again, leading to an argument. Wang and Chen violently assaulted Gong, who could not defend himself and was injured. However, the two did not stop and tried to drag Gong ashore for further beating. In the dark, Gong suddenly lost his footing and fell into the Huangpu River. Seeing that a life had been taken, Chen and Wang fled. Although Gong knew how to swim, he was seriously injured and unable to struggle, resulting in drowning. Trying to resolve a dispute, he lost his own life. Ye Shenglin immediately reported the incident to Gong's wife, Sun, who then reported it to the General Police Station, requesting the arrest of the perpetrators Wang Meifu and Chen Linhu. Meanwhile, they tried to recover the body. Detective Ni Jiaxin arrested Wang and Chen. The body was finally found on the 25th and taken to the Fielun Road morgue. The coroner confirmed that death was due to drowning after being beaten. The family was instructed to collect the body. The police yesterday sent Wang and Chen to the First Special District Court. Judge Shen interrogated them, and the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested that the two defendants be punished according to Article 294 of the Criminal Law. Gong's wife, Gong Sun, stated that she had a 70-year-old mother-in-law and a two-year-old child who depended on her husband for support and requested that the defendants be ordered to pay compensation of 1,000 yuan. However, the two defendants only agreed to pay more than 100 yuan, stating that they could not afford a larger amount. After arguments between the defendants' lawyer and the police lawyer, Judge Shen ordered the defendants to be detained and set a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Boat Girl Drowns</h3>
<p>Zhao, a boatman from Suzhou, had a 17-year-old daughter who had been promised in marriage and was scheduled to marry in the first month of the next spring. In order to buy her dowry, the girl accompanied her mother on a boat to Shanghai. The boat was moored at the public pier on the south embankment of the old garbage bridge on the Suzhou River. Yesterday (the 31st), at 12:30 PM, during a heavy rainstorm, Zhao's daughter went ashore to shop. However, the gangplank was slippery, and she lost her footing and fell into the river. The tide was high at the time. Zhao and the boat crew immediately tried to rescue her, and they finally retrieved her body at 1:30 PM. They carried her ashore and tried to resuscitate her, but she had been in the water too long and could not be revived. Her body was laid on the bow of the boat, and her mother and others wept bitterly.</p>
<h3>Ning Shao Steamer Line Revises Tips Starting Today</h3>
<p>Adhering to Ministry Orders to Collect 20% of Ticket Price</p>
<p>It has been observed that the tips given to the stewards by passengers on various commercial steamers traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo often equal the ticket price, greatly exceeding the fare itself. Although these tips are supposedly voluntary, they have become a customary practice. Given the current difficult economic situation, this burden on passengers is excessively heavy. The Ning Shao Steamer Line Company, recognizing this issue, has decided to implement a new policy starting from September 1st. Stewards' tips on the new Ning Shao steamers will be uniformly set at 20% of the ticket price, in accordance with Ministry orders. This restriction has been officially announced to all stewards on the new Ning Shao line.</p>

Tonight, in their second battle, they will meet the Youyou Sports Association at the Youyou Basketball Hall on Route Mettehurst. The battle will begin at 7 PM. Yesterday's football match against Huadong was again blocked by the rain god.</p>

<h3>Opinions on Sending Zheng Zhaojia to the Americas</h3>
<p>In order to revive the Chinese tennis world</p>
<p>Please invite Mr. Zheng to go to California</p>
<p>Support Lin Baohua to go to the United States together</p>
<p>Hope for unanimous advocacy</p>
<p>Friends who care about the tennis situation in Shanghai are unanimous in saying that Zheng Zhaojia is Shanghai's future champion and will be China's first national player in the future. However, with Mr. Zheng's talent, staying in Shanghai for a long time will definitely not make much progress. Lin Qiu is a precedent. Therefore, in order to revive Chinese tennis and restore the glory of the eighth Far Eastern Games, everyone unanimously advocates inviting Mr. Zheng to go to the United States. Lin Baohua also wrote a very thorough letter, which was published in the Mainland Report. Whether or not to take this up, this is our opinion.</p>
<h3>California is the Most Appropriate</h3>
<p>Of course, needless to say, with Mr. Zheng's talent, if he can live in the United States for one or two years, his technical progress will be greatly improved through the influence of various famous players. For the sake of reviving the Chinese tennis world, it is necessary to invite Mr. Zheng to go to the United States. Moreover, California is the center and birthplace of American tennis stars.</p>
<h3>Don't Want Mr. Zheng to Sacrifice His Studies</h3>
<p>However, Mr. Zheng is still in school, and he must not sacrifice all his studies in order to become a special tennis player. Therefore, the most appropriate way is to go to California to study for a few years, just like Barnes, who is a student at the University of Southern California.</p>
<h3>Hope the 협진회 Will Rise Up and Advocate</h3>
<p>We don't know about Mr. Zheng's family situation. Going to the Americas like this will of course be a heavy financial burden. Today, when China cannot take care of anything, it is impossible to ask the government for help. Therefore, I think friends who love tennis, are enthusiastic about sports, and hope that China can win some honor in sports, everyone should rise up and express their advocacy, and the中華全國體育협진회 can also rise up and take the lead.</p>
<p>Support Lin Baohua to go together</p>
<p>If it becomes a reality, Mr. Zheng will go. The next question is this. However, creating a Zheng Zhaojia, for example, if you want to participate in the Davis Cup, a single army will not form a brigade. To go to Wimberton alone, I am afraid there will be very few achievements. Therefore, we very much hope that Lin Baohua will go together.</p>
<h3>Lin Baohua Also Has Hope</h3>
<p>Many people oppose Lin because his skills have regressed. The real reason for the regression is that he can't find the opportunity to practice. Mr. Lin is only twenty-six years old now. With his talent, he is naturally a promising person. Moreover, Mr. Zheng is his student, and the success of their doubles cooperation this summer makes us firmly believe that Mr. Lin has the necessary conditions to go together. We must go to the active side. Negativity, in other words, is suicide.</p>
<h3>Soliciting Public Opinion</h3>
<p>As for the trip to the United States by Mr. Zheng and Mr. Lin, some people agree to ask the government authorities and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for help. This is our proposal. How to proceed? I hope that friends who pay attention to this issue will publish their opinions and everyone will promote the realization of this matter. The opportunity cannot be missed again.</p>
<h3>Qiu Feihai Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Arriving here tomorrow on the French Post Athos</p>
<p>It has been rumored that tennis general Qiu Feihai will come to Shanghai. According to a telegram sent to his friend, it has been determined that he will arrive here from Hong Kong tomorrow, on the French Post Athos II. He will arrive at the port at 11 AM tomorrow morning. The ship will dock at the China Merchants Bureau Terminal in Hongqiao.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>A Record of the Leshan Hall</h3>
<p>— Xu Jingxian</p>
<p>I once recited a poem by the early Qing Dynasty artist Mo Jingdao, which said: [This joy is extraordinary joy, the sound of the bell shakes the four seas. Seven thousand years pass in an instant, ninety thousand miles of sailing. The sun shines brightly in the mid-heaven, the stars shine brightly at dawn. There is nothing else to offer joy, but a volume of gospel.] This kind of poetic realm, what is called Leshan Hall, seems to resemble it!</p>
<p>Leshan Hall is where Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a ninety-three-year-old, currently resides. The address is in Xujiahui, facing the former residence of Xu Guangqi of Ming Dynasty, looking at each other from afar, like neighbors. Sixty years ago, the old man was over thirty years old. In addition to lecturing and discussing Tao, he was engaged in observing celestial phenomena. Later, he went to serve in Korea, and was sent to Dongying, visited North America, and returned to Europe. He returned to his parents' country to ask about politics and promote learning. He is old! It is rare for life to reach seventy years in ancient times. The villagers also broadcast as a beautiful talk. I still remember the famous Roman Ji Zailu said in the book on old age that [old age can be calm and pure, then it must be gentle and without offense, such as Plato at the age of eighty-one, still writing until his death. Isocrates at the age of ninety-four, also wrote books without stopping, and his teacher Georgeya at the age of one hundred and seven, still tirelessly taught people.] I also remember that Mr. Wu Zhihui wished the owner of Leshan Hall: [Get the thickness of heaven and earth, should live to be 18,000 years old, only after twice 1%.] This can show that heaven is generous to the ancients and not thin to the present people.</p>
<p>Dr. Ling, constitutional elder of Shen Bao, asked for words and once recorded the sayings of Ma Xiangbo, an old man of ninety-three; now, due to business, he asked me to continue it: I will record what I have heard. If there is any error, the responsibility lies with the reporter!</p>
<h3>Wishing the [Transformation] of Free Talk!</h3>
<p>— Yang Zheng</p>
<p>Free [Talk] Talk [Freedom]</p>
<p>[Freedom] The word in China, which had not been Europeanized and closed to the outside world, was of course not the modern [freedom] that is taught together with [equality]; it only carried the meaning of [casual]. Literally, the three words [Free Talk] will be misunderstood as [casual talk]. Therefore, the extremely valuable [supplement] is often despised because of this misunderstanding. Recently, most of the [supplements] in many newspapers, in addition to the words and chapters of singing the wind and playing with the moon, are the texts of talking about demons and saying strange things; getting worse and worse, even sperm, genitals, farts, urine, and feces... are taken as important [themes]: Therefore, the most infamous [newspaper ass] has also become its [honorable title]; this is the [supplement's] own inadvertent [speech] and self-inflicted humiliation! Free Talk in the past really contained the tendency of [casual talk]; that is, in recent times, except for Tao Zhiqing's No Chuting Caozhai husband's talk collection and Cheng Zhanlu's Two One Branch Tan, which have lively and profound strokes and the style of [talking about subtle points], almost always found articles that only have literary value but lack the meaning of [praising or criticizing, distinguishing good from evil]. This is naturally the [supernatural] disease of the [no politics] of the previous [supplement]; at the same time, it is also the result of [no freedom] of speech. Once there is [freedom] of speech, even if the [supplement] is small, why can't you talk about national affairs? Because you can't [talk], so [talking] is also [not free]; finally, it's simply [not talking]! Free Talk has to focus on the [talk] aspect. Now I have decided to [transform] from September 1st, this [removing the old and renewing] [advance] is worthy of admiration! I sincerely hope that Free Talk can hold on to an indomitable spirit and stand on the position of [freedom] of speech to say a few more words for the [liberation] and [freedom] of the Chinese people, and even all mankind, after the [transformation] of [September 1st]! I wish:</p>
<p>[[Before [September 1st], [After [September 1st],</p>
<p>Free Talk; Free Talk;</p>
<p>Free Talk, Free Talk,</p>
<p>Free [Talk] Talk. Talk [Freedom]!]]</p>
<h3>Poetic Autumn</h3>
<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>Who Can Control Hot Soup and Hot Water?</p>
<p>It's getting cooler in autumn, and the wind is blowing so coolly in people's hearts and minds. Feeling the heat of summer, one cannot help but feel the loveliness of autumn. Summer is so hot that it makes people look for soda and shaved ice. The rotating fan spins overhead, and the cold water cools the whole room, but still, it is嫌着 the heat of summer!</p>
<p>Who can control the three eastern provinces? Those with guns and cannons still can't conquer them, so who will take care of this idle business! Who has forgotten the three northeastern provinces, and needs to be busy with sweat all over in the explosive weather?</p>
<p>Returning from the eastern dawn dance hall, or sleepily emerging from the cinema in the middle of the night, who can get rid of and grab the shadow of the northeast in the atmosphere of flesh in the city?</p>
<p>The autumn wind is coming, after all, it is a poetic autumn. The leaves are rustling, the long wind sweeps the ground, feeling the coolness of autumn, the hot summer is actually forgotten!</p>
<p>The battle situation of January 28 is the time when it can be greatly appreciated. On the banks of the Wusong River, re-boarding the fort, pointing, this is the crater of the bomb thrown by the enemy army, this is the scar of the cannonball fired by the enemy army when twenty-four warships besieged the fort. What an amazing battle record! What a strong poetic meaning, this autumn, this cool autumn!</p>
<p>The northeast has been sinking for years, and the border province of Jehol, the enemy army is attacking again with heavy troops. Jehol, Jehol, who can control this hot soup and hot water? Fortunately, everyone can endure watching the northeast sink for years, and the mere Jehol, who will cheer up?</p>
<h3>The Fly in the Beer</h3>
<p>— Mian Mian</p>
<p>How the French See Chinese People</p>
<p>The Japanese insulting the Chinese doesn't need me to say. Americans insulting the Chinese in films is also common knowledge. As for the French, they are now on the world stage colluding with the Japanese, so naturally they don't harbor any good feelings towards the Chinese. We can understand the situation by looking at the example given below.</p>
<p>There is a section in a French book with the title [The Fly in the Beer]. Translated as follows:</p>
<p>[When a customer orders a beer in a tavern and finds a fly in the glass, the attitude they take varies depending on their nationality.</p>
<p>The Spaniard pays the money and runs out of the store.</p>
<p>The Frenchman first catches the fly, steps on it to death, and then gives the store staff a loud scolding.</p>
<p>The Englishman spills the beer on the ground and shouts, "Waiter, bring me another glass!" and immediately changes the subject.</p>
<p>The German takes the fly out and drinks the beer again.</p>
<p>The Russian doesn't care about these small things and swallows the fly and the beer together.</p>
<p>Finally, what about the Chinese? He first chews the fly like an experienced gourmet to savor its taste, and then slowly drinks the beer.]</p>
<p>Are there such absurd and outrageous words? Even the Chinese themselves have probably never seen such a Chinese person! A Chinese person who eats flies. I only know that there is a Japanese person who eats caterpillars and snakes. This Japanese person would definitely eat flies as well. But I have never known a Chinese person who eats flies. This is not to save face for the Chinese, but there really is no such talent. The Chinese person in this description is definitely not a real Chinese person living in this world. It must be the Chinese person in the minds of the French.</p>
<p>This description only tells us which countries the French hate. They hate the Germans, Russians, and Chinese. Yes, it is consistent with the current French attitude towards international affairs, isn't it?</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts After Waking Up</h3>
<p>— Ji Xiang</p>
<p>The Sins of New and Old Sexual Concepts</p>
<p>In this era, everything is contradictory. The old is shaking and collapsing, but its remnants are still left everywhere; the new, waiting to be installed, cannot be installed, and in the end, only some breath is attached.</p>
<p>The old is repelling the new, and the new is cursing the old. It's a pity they don't have a chance to shake hands.</p>
<p>The era is like an enlarged bound foot. The foot binding cloth is removed, and the shoes are enlarged, but its toes are still curved. Walking is unnatural, and sometimes you have to stuff a large piece of cotton into the toe of the shoe.</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>The concepts of the two sexes are always so wonderfully incredible.</p>
<p>I believe that my heart is very frank and pure, without any obscene concepts mixed in it. But when I talk to a woman, I can't help but feel that she is a woman. If this woman is a little prettier, I can still feel a slight intoxication, although I don't think so.</p>
<p>Friend, you probably have this experience too.</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>Regarding the sins of sex, men are generally responsible, which seems to be a matter of course and beyond reproach.</p>
<p>However, scarlet lips, snow-white cheeks, watery charming eyes, annoying fragrance, tight clothes, fleshy stockings, pink trousers: these, these, are everywhere emitting a kind of seductive power. As a result, men pursue and commit crimes.</p>
<p>Is it the man's fault, or is the woman deceiving the man?</p>
<h3>Ramblings</h3>
<p>— Liu. Huo. An</p>
<p>Many chaotic people in chaotic times. Chaotic people mess around methodically. Chaotic people make a name for themselves through chaos.</p>
<p>Thinking wildly is chaotic ideology. Talking nonsense is chaotic propaganda. Being flustered is chaotic struggle. Creating trouble is chaotic revolution.</p>
<p>▲ Correction Yesterday's "Browsing at the Study" Discussing the Hongzhang's Chapter. The "not advancing a step" sentence. Step was mistakenly planted as level. Also, the sentence "at that time, the Secretary and Hanlin officials" Secretary was mistakenly planted as Village Military Officer. Combined correction.</p>
<h3>Silver Threads</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>This small town has been tidied up for more than two months, but the war-torn mounds can still be seen everywhere, although it suffered the least artillery fire and the lightest trampling by the enemy among the many war zones.</p>
<p>However, Ms. Yu Fenruo's home has been destroyed by artillery fire. Apart from a clothing bag that she took with her when she fled the town, she has nothing left. Originally, she was alone, without a husband, children, or any family members. After the war, there was no need to live in this small town again; but she still cared about a madwoman in her neighborhood. Her charitable heart drove her to find this poor woman who was hated by the whole town. She actually found her and lived with her in a house.</p>
<p>Strange! The house where this madwoman lived was only separated from Yu Fenruo's house by a storefront, but it was not bombed by enemy artillery fire, while the neighbors on the left and right had walls collapsed and houses overturned. This madwoman did not escape, and she did not die in the bullets and artillery fire.</p>
<p>This madwoman is too pitiful. She is also alone, without any relatives or family members. Perhaps she has some relatives, but when she is mad, she is very annoying, so no one wants to associate with her, although she also has times when she is mentally clear and not completely mad. Only Yu Fenruo pities her and wants to befriend her, and takes good care of her.</p>
<p>Their lives are very pitiful. Yu Fenruo takes some embroidery work from the embroidery shop in Shanghai to do needlework to make a living. When the madwoman is mentally clear, she carries a cloth basket and mends for people. Yu Fenruo only knows that her surname is Yuan, and she knows nothing about her background and how she became a madwoman; she sometimes asked Yuan, but she never spoke clearly. She only heard her crazy talk when she was mad and vaguely understood that she was a woman who had been abandoned. The people in the town also don't know Yu Fenruo's history, they only know that she is a middle-aged woman, because she is already a forty-year-old woman, and no bad people dare to bully her anymore. She lives a hard life and helps Yuan, who is about the same age as her, to live a pitiful life.</p>
<p>Such women are common in townships and are not surprising, so no one pays attention to them, but an old man from the embroidery shop [release life] (the person who distributes and collects embroidery work to the workers' homes is called release life) looks up to Yu Fenruo and knows that she often helps Yuan. This release life person is called Mr. Wang.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in Gold Standard Funds</h3>
<p>▲Finally Rises by Four Liang One Qian Yesterday's situation of gold standard funds was still chaotic and changing rapidly. There was a review of five liang in the morning and afternoon, but in the end, it rose again to four liang zero. The intention of the industry was to remain firm and rise. Due to the frequent rise of silver and British silver in the silver market, and American silver remained as before, the gold price opened higher. The reason was that the United States tended to sell, the market was sluggish, and the forward silver price was slightly lower. Afterwards, it went from high to low, mainly because the American exchange rate was both overtly and covertly loose, which was due to the repeated rise in exchange rates. Afterwards, buyers became brave, and it was heard that a certain bank hedged out American exchange, so there was talk of absorbing spot goods, and it suddenly became sharp, once exceeding the 700 liang mark. It was learned that Russia had military actions against Japan, and planned to concentrate troops in Manchuria. The market waves rose suddenly and turned downward. There were still many sellers. In short, people's hearts were flustered and difficult to guess. The market will be closed on Wednesday as usual, but it is not yet resolved whether it will continue to be closed next Wednesday or restore the old rules. Today, the situation in the previous market is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲A Morning Market with Several Ups and Downs From the opening of the October market in the early morning, it rose by three liang and seven qian to 696 liang and eight qian. The big bar rose slightly by one-sixteenth. There were no changes in American silver official and private telegrams, and the forward silver fell slightly by five hao. With the activity of buyers, Tong Taichang Yuhe Yuan Maoyong and others took the lead and continued to add one liang zero, for ninety-eight liang and two qian. At that time, Hengxing and Hengyu Hengchang Yong and others came to sell, and the Shanghai Bank initially sold December US dollars at 32.0625, which immediately depreciated by more than one liang, for ninety-six liang and a half, and the hedgers came out. Unexpectedly, they entered again in a moment, so they sold December at 32 yuan, and October British gold at 19875. Various banks mutually traded September US dollars at 31.5 to 4375, and Hengxing Hengyu Yuanxing Yong Bing Xing Yifeng Yong Tong Taichang Yuantai Hengchang Yong Daxing Yong and others bought enthusiastically, gradually rising by three liang, with only one liang of profit-taking. At 9:20, it was 99 liang and six qian. At this time, Hengxing came out again. Yuhe Fuxing Yongyuan Dayong Dadecheng Yuan Maoyong Richang Zhifeng Yong and others all sold, and the December US dollars at 32 yuan were not easy to sell again. Because HSBC's listed prices were the same as before, the US dollars were hedged, so they lengthened by 125, and the gold price fell sharply by three liang, 9:30 for 96 liang and eight qian, and after a moment, it added one liang and saw the decline again. Because the December US dollars at 32 yuan could be settled, Hengyu Hengxing Yuanyi Fengyong Goods and other came to compete for sale, immediately falling by two liang zero, 10:00 for 95 liang and a half, shifting and fluctuating by more than one liang. At 10:30, it was suddenly heard that the central government was absorbing cash, so people's hearts turned better. Hengyu Tong Taichang Bing Xing Richang Zhifeng Yong Yifeng Yong Hengchang Yong Hengxing Yuan Futai Heng Yuantai and others were excited to buy, to September US dollars 5625 could be sold, the market was firm, and in half an hour it rose sharply by four liang zero, rarely looking back, and at nearly 11 o'clock it was 700 liang 005 qian. Unexpectedly, it was a flash in the pan and was about to be exhausted again. Suddenly, there was a rumor that the situation between Japan and Russia was deteriorating, and people's hearts were immediately empty. The selling wind suddenly intensified, such as Dadecheng Zhifeng Yongyi Yongfeng Hengyu Shunli Goods hedge and so on. In particular, HSBC came out with September US dollars 5625, December 0625, and the market price泻 for four liang and several qian. 11:30 for 95 liang and eight qian. Tong Taichang repeatedly advanced, Zhifeng Yong Yuantai continued to advance, and the price returned to two liang well. 11:30 for 97 liang and nine qian. Afterwards, it seemed weak, but there were several qian of rise and fall, and at noon it was 96 liang and nine qian. It closed at 97 liang and two qian, which was four liang and one qian higher than the previous day. It continued to raise about two liang, for eight liang. The maximum price in half a day was 700 liang 005 qian, and the minimum price was 695 liang and a half, suppressing five liang, and the bare bar was added by ten liang.</p>
<p>▲The quoted price is slightly suppressed by six or seven liang The quoted price of US dollars is listed at 125, so it is changed to 771 liang, calculated to suppress 73 liang, then 76 liang, and then 70 liang, and finally 74 liang, which is six or seven liang less than yesterday. The registration and water supplement are both 97 liang.</p>
<p>▲There are many speculators seeking On the table trading, it is quite different, and generally the demand is greater than the supply. Statistics Tong Taichang, Hengchang Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Yuantai, Futai Heng, Daxing Yong, Yuhe, Yifeng Yong, Fuyu, Xie Xing Yong, Hengxing Yuan, Zhaofengchang, Zhifeng Yong, etc. are all purchased. Wanxing, Shunli Yuanchun, Hengyu, Richang, Hongkang Yong have frequent ins and outs. Yuan Maoyong, Yuanda Yong, Dadecheng, Fuxing Yong, etc. are all out. Bing Xing advances first and then goes out. Other numbers are complicated. Dalian gangs total over two hundred bars and put out over three hundred more, Guangzhou-based transactions appear desolate.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Exchange Market is Slightly Improved</h3>
<p>Gold Shops are Hoarding Excessively</p>
<p>Silver Companies Import the Near Future</p>
<p>Yesterday, although British silver rose, the market was weak, and American silver did not move, so the local market did not have much impact, and the trend seemed good. HSBC's listed prices, British, Indian and Hong Kong silver did not have gains or losses, but the US dollars were lengthened by 125, which was because the exchange rate rose again by half a cent to 625. French Indian silver was increased by 2 yuan, and German silver was increased by 25. The inner market initially stabilized, then strengthened and then loosened, and then improved again, and finally it was flat. As a result, compared with yesterday, British silver was reduced by 0625 and the US exchange rate was reduced by 125, which can be said to be an overt release and covert improvement. The gold price rose again by four liang. There were many transactions between Chinese merchants. Tens of thousands of pounds of British silver were calculated. Sassoon Bank continued to purchase January futures, and US dollars were about 5 or 60 yuan. Various gold shops were hoarding excessively, HSBC sold some, and silver companies slightly imported the near future. Chinese banks such as Shanghai Bank did not slacken their selling intentions, and the central government appeared with futures, or cashed out cash. The afternoon was closed due to Wednesday.</p>
<p>▲The exchange rate within the market fluctuated by 0625 in half a day. From the early opening selling price of one shilling and nine pence 875 to ten pence 0625 buying price 9375 to ten pence 125, the difference between September and December was 1875. Mai Bank entered October 875 and exited January at ten pence (Sassoon entered). HSBC Wahbi exited December 9375 and closed at noon with a selling price of nine pence 8125 to ten pence and a buying price of 0625.</p>
<p>▲US exchange rate The inner market had a stretch of 1875 in the morning and afternoon. The opening price in September was 31.625 yuan, October 75, November 875, and December 32 yuan. The buying price was 75 to 32.125 yuan (September swaps December to open 375, Shanghai exits December 32.0625, Citibank exits 32 yuan, Shanghai exits October 31.75 again, Citibank Wahbi mutually trade September at half yuan, to 4375, Wahbi absorbs December 32 yuan, Zhenggin exits and Citibank enters September 5625, Ananda HSBC mutually trade December 32 yuan, Mai Bank enters 0625, HSBC Ananda mutually trade December 32 yuan, Shanghai exits September 5625 (Silver Company enters).

<h3>The Silver Dollar Market is Very Prosperous at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>▲The market transactions are prosperous and the collection and settlement are very prosperous Yesterday, due to the end of the big month, the collection and settlement of silver dollars in the silver money industry was very prosperous. In addition to the original examples, there were also many for settlement, so the situation was very busy. As for the silver dollar transaction situation in the market, the foreign transactions were also very tight and smooth. The silver lending bills were also slightly more than usual, but the market price of foreign money was slightly good in the early market and still soft in the afternoon market, and the silver root was still soft.</p>
<p>▲Foreign Cents Rose in the Early Market and Fell in the Afternoon, Silver Lending Remains Weak [Foreign Cents] Foreign transactions were very prosperous in the early market, and people's hearts were very good, so the cent price immediately went beyond 9 cents, for 6 qian 8 fen 9 li 2 hao and a half. The afternoon market still fell back, and the price was the same as the previous day, for 6 qian 8 fen 8 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half. The situation was slightly better than the previous day. [Silver Lending] Because the first money was sufficient, and the bank also had outbound warehouses, the silver lending became weaker. The early and afternoon markets were both 4 fen, which was 1 fen less than the previous day. The head has never been watered, and the lines are all white.</p>
<p>▲Among the Auxiliary Coins, Copper Coins Have Not Risen or Fallen for a Long Time Jiangnan small foreign coins were slightly higher than the previous day by 1 cent, calculated as 5 qian 9 fen 6 li. There was no difference between the early and afternoon markets. Transactions were 7,500 jiao in the early market and 3,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins, the early market seemed good at 7 hao and a half, for 5 qian 8 fen 2 li 7 hao and a half, and the afternoon market fell again to 5 qian 8 fen 2 li. Transactions were 155,000 jiao in the early market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained unchanged, calculated as 433,000 wen, transactions were more than 55,400 strings, calculated as silver 12,800 liang.</p>
<p>▲Silver Collection and Settlement is Especially Busy Due to the End of the Month Yesterday, the bank's collection and settlement was very busy. Chinese merchants' collection and settlement bills amounted to more than 4 million, and foreign merchants' collection and settlement bills were also about 4 million. There were even more settlements and collection and settlements. Chinese and foreign banks totaled 7 to 8 million, mortgage transactions were more than 1.9 million, and various goods, exchange taxes, miscellaneous mortgages and other settlements amounted to more than 16 million, outbound warehouses were 1.4 million, money shops and silver public single settlements were more than 34 million, and head-start settlements were more than 5.4 million. Collection and settlement of exchange bills from all roads was more than 1.1 million, and cash collection was more than 1 million.</p>
<p>▲Foreign Transactions are Prosperous in the Morning and Afternoon, but Sales are Still Sluggish Hui's Settlement Bills, 930,000 were made in the early market and 760,000 in the afternoon market. In the banknote market, 75,000 were made in the early market and 100,500 in the afternoon market. Outside the market, 172,000 were made in the early market and 80,000 in the afternoon market. Bank checks were 65,000 in the early market and 50,000 in the afternoon market. Bank trading, mutual trading was 850,000 in the early market and 800,000 in the afternoon market. Various banks had a lot of foreign household transactions, totaling more than 3.2 million. More than 1.2 million banknotes were recovered and more than 800,000 were issued. Money shops and foreign public single settlements were more than 9.1 million, foreign settlement of head-start money was more than 2.8 million, and foreign exchange lending in and out was more than 2.4 million. Foreign mortgage transactions were more than 800,000, and small money shop transactions were 8 or 900,000.</p>
<h3>Total Amount of Silver Lending Last Month</h3>
<p>The silver root was loose and sluggish last month, reaching its extreme point. However, the silver lending market price was still above 1 qian in the first ten days, and then it fell into the 1 qian range, and it never exceeded the 1 qian range until the end of the month. Therefore, the total amount of silver lending for the entire month, with a total of 2 liang 2 qian 3 fen in 31 days, was only 7 fen 03 hao per day. Although this year (except for February and March in the first half of the year) there has been no highest silver lending news, the current situation makes it difficult to see a turnaround. Generally, the interest rate case will be between 2 liang and 2 liang and a half in this general meeting, which is not as good as the bottom code of interest-owing settlement. The supply and demand users of the general deposit and owed parties, the handling expenses are self-evident.</p>
<h3>The Securities and Bond Market is Still Extremely Deserted</h3>
<p>No Market Price in October, All Trending Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday (31st), the situation of various bond markets in the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the spot market only opened in the aftermarket, with a transaction of 8,200 yuan. Among them, the 19th year Customs Public Bonds, which had not been traded for a long time, suddenly traded 1,000 yuan. The futures market was as deserted as before. The market atmosphere was very cold, and people were waiting and watching. There were still many retail customers seeking to sell, and there were few purchases, so the price was unanimously lower than before the settlement. Among them, the layoff spot was down one and a half yuan from last week, and the rest were down four or five jiao to seven or eight jiao. Observing the bond market situation, it seems not optimistic, and it may have to hover and continue to weaken for the time being.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Rises First and Then Falls</h3>
<p>This local Xinfeng Foreign Bank reports that on the 30th, railway stocks were quite active, and the market tended to be firm. Steel stocks rose first, once creating a new high price. The aftermarket was more active, and various stocks rose one after another. When closing, it suddenly suffered an unexpected blow, and the price fell back.

<h3>Activity of Sellers in the Yarn, Flower, and Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is trending down and the situation is weaker. Because American cotton has fallen back, people's hearts are slightly tired, and sellers are active again. The actual demand is not smooth, and there are many rumors in the local area, so retail investors unanimously tend to short, but large long-term investors are still increasing their holdings, and their intentions are still strong and bullish.</p>
<p>▲The human standard falls back by two and a half. In the opening of the human standard market in the pre-market, due to the fall in American cotton, retail investors shorted, and the market was tired. Each month fell one liang and one hundred and thirty-five qian, but large investors still entered. The market situation in the afternoon was still flat, and each month fell one or two qian. The total number of transactions for the day was 36,450 packages. Check the sales of Xincheng 2,200 packages, Yichang 2,150 packages, Tianlong 1,900 packages, and Yuande 1,500 packages.

<h3>Recent Cotton Prices Drop Six Cash</h3>
<p>After seven consecutive days of price increases, American cotton prices reversed course today, falling 50 points per pound. This caused the previously firm confidence in the local market to waver. There was more profit-taking, and the market became looser. However, major players continued to buy on the dips to increase their holdings. In addition, the weather was adverse, with heavy rain expected. Some believe that because cotton is currently being harvested, prolonged rain would be detrimental to the crop.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Biao Profit-Taking Increases</p>
<p>Trading on the Zheng Biao market opened lower, following the decline in international cotton prices. The situation remained relatively stable, with major players making purchases. In the second session, prices remained flat, with all months falling by four to five cash. In the afternoon, prices for all months dropped slightly by an additional 0.05 to 0.1 cash. Total trading volume for the day was 147,900 dan (a unit of weight). Sell orders included Dafu (3,000 dan), Gengfeng (5,100 dan), Xincheng (4,200 dan), Changfeng (3,600 dan), and Yuanda (3,400 dan). Buy orders included Ruida (4,900 dan), Yuchang (5,800 dan), Suilong (3,200 dan), Renfeng (3,500 dan), Yiyu (3,100 dan), Yuanda (2,500 dan), and Rongxing (2,700 dan).

<h3>International Cotton Prices Plunge Suddenly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market experienced mixed conditions. Prices initially weakened due to profit-taking by long positions, but then rebounded due to buying by industry participants. Futures prices fell by 41 to 53 points per pound, while spot prices fell by 50 points per pound. British cotton futures fell by 36 to 37 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 20 points. Indian cotton weakened due to lackluster opening prices in Liverpool and profit-taking by long positions. Pingguoer fell by 0.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 0.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.25 rupees. (Report from the 30th)</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Trends Stabilize</h3>
<p>▲ South Shanghai Yesterday, the supply of rice from the west road increased slightly compared to the previous day, reaching about 32 numbers (of units). However, the amount of rice remaining in storage remained high. Demand from urban and rural shops was poor. Prices for thick japonica rice increased again, while prices for thin indica rice showed slight movement. Around ten dan of Tongli River Beach rice arrived. The quality of the rice was good, and the market price was about 9.5 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ New Zha The rice market saw the arrival of 20 units yesterday. Trading on this street was limited due to rain. Northern japonica rice was tight, while central rice showed signs of loosening. Early indica rice prices were neither good nor bad. Demand for glutinous rice remained strong, and prices rose by nearly 0.1 yuan. The prices of new japonica rice are now stable.</p>
<h3>Hunan Rice Arrives in Port</h3>
<p>An additional 1,000 bags are expected to arrive tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market appeared even more lackluster due to weak demand. The continued arrival of Hunan rice put downward pressure on prices. Yesterday, local brokers in the city sold over 100 bags of Hunan rice, with the rest being used for local needs. Hunan rice prices fell by an additional 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day. Reports that a large shipment of Hunan rice, totaling over 10,000 bags, was coming to Shanghai further dampened market sentiment. However, the China Merchants Jiangda steamer, which is scheduled to arrive today or tomorrow, is only carrying about 1,000 bags of Hunan rice. The remaining amount has been mostly unloaded due to the weak market in Shanghai, awaiting a better opportunity. Only 320 bags of Jili rice were traded citywide, at a price of 8.85 to 8.8 yuan. Rice merchants were still asking 8.45 yuan for rice, while buyers were only offering 8.1 to 8.2 yuan, making it difficult to reach an agreement. 200 bags of Saigon rice were offered at 9.39 yuan, and 400 bags of small-grain rice were offered at 9.05 to 8.9 yuan, all of which were purchased by local traders.</p>
<h3>Only 3,000 Bags of Flour Delivered in August</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for August flour. The total delivery volume for the day was very limited, as major players had already settled their accounts or had their clients withdraw the flour. Therefore, only a few outstanding transactions were actually fulfilled. Huafeng Factory delivered 2,000 bags of Green Wheat Root flour, and Tailong delivered 1,000 bags of Recycled Green Ball flour. There were no other deliveries. International wheat quotations have fallen by 0.2 to 0.4 yuan, so opening prices for next month are expected to decline as well.</p>
<h3>78 Truckloads of August Wheat Delivered</h3>
<p>The delivery of August standard wheat was fully completed yesterday, totaling 78 truckloads. (37 truckloads were previously withdrawn by Shen Da Factory). Deliveries were made by Dingtai (5 truckloads), Shenchang (26 truckloads), Runde (11 truckloads), Rencheng (18 truckloads), Yixing (13 truckloads), No. 8 and No. 28 (2 truckloads each), and No. 25 (1 truckload). Purchases were made by Tailun. Most of the wheat was reportedly taken by factories.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Dried Longan Arrives</h3>
<p>The first batch of sun-dried longan from Tong'an and Zhangzhou has arrived. According to sources, less than ten pieces in total, among which there are only three or four pieces of standard sun-dried longan and the rest are Tong'an dried longan. It is expected to open for trading today.</p>
<p>Over 700 Pieces Shipped Again the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>With strong sales of European and American silk, the consumption of dried cocoons has increased significantly. Due to insufficient cocoon inventories in Shanghai, dried cocoons from the interior are being continuously shipped to Shanghai to take advantage of high prices. As a result, shipments of new dried cocoons from Anhui are strong. The day before yesterday, various ships transported 748 pieces of dried cocoons from Wuhu and Datong.</p>
<h3>Telegram Orders for Raw Silk Continue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the raw silk market in Shanghai continued to be firm and active. Telegram orders for various grades of European and American silk were sent out yesterday morning, and demand remained strong. The market sentiment was robust. Liannaxin and others imported 60 bales of Grade B 13-15 denier Shanghai white filature silk at prices ranging from 600 to 630 taels. Ganli Yihe and others imported 60 bales of 13-15 denier Sichuan yellow filature silk at prices ranging from 585 to 660 taels.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Turns Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai became quiet. British firms are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach due to the gradual increase in the price of silver in Britain and the unwillingness of Chinese merchants to relax their prices. As a result, transactions have become scarce. Yesterday, only needle tea, eyebrow tea, and low-grade Gongxi tea saw some trading. High-value teas such as Zhenmei Pearl Tea have almost completely stopped trading.</p>
<h3>Non-Ferrous Metals - Pure Antimony Expected to See Activity</h3>
<p>The non-ferrous metals market remains chaotic, with fluctuating transactions and unpredictable trends. Generally, the current situation is viewed as atypical and not representative of a normal market.</p>
<p>▲ Hunan Pure Antimony Stirs with Anticipation Pure antimony is a special product of China, with considerable sales to Japan, Western Europe, the United States, and Canada. However, since the discovery of antimony mines in the Soviet Union, sales to Western Europe have been cut off. The market now relies on Japan and the United States, but weak actual demand has limited purchases, leaving the Shanghai market stagnant. Recently, inquiries have been increasing, suggesting a potential change in the market. Prices are at 195 taels per ton, up over 10 taels from before.</p>
<p>▲ Local Wire Nail Exports Are Extensive Since the price decrease, local wire nail exports have sharply increased. Business is bustling, especially in Qingdao, the Yangtze River region, Fujian, Guangdong, and Shantou, where purchases have been made. Prices are at 6 taels per barrel (including taxes), while the local market price is 5.4 taels. Reportedly, purchase offers have reached 500-600 barrels, and there are still many buyers looking to place orders.</p>
<p>▲ Refined Tin Market in Awkward Situation Refined tin transactions have been mostly small-scale recently. With the Shaoxing merchants adopting a wait-and-see approach, the market has become quiet, making it difficult for prices to rise. Although overseas prices are higher than local prices, the market is stuck in an awkward situation with no ability to develop. Yesterday, 200-300 dan were offered, with Xiaoxiong priced at 85 taels, Dutch tin at 92 taels, mixed tin at 86-87 taels, and Hook Light at 48 taels.</p>
<p>▲ 500+ Dan of Zinc Plate Traded Yesterday Yesterday's torrential rain significantly reduced non-ferrous metals trading. However, 560-570 dan of zinc plate, which had been out of demand for a while, were traded by Tianjin merchants at 8.5 taels per dan, a slight increase from before. Inventory levels are reportedly low, creating positive sentiment and expectations for continued improvement in the market.</p>
<h3>Dull Coal Trade, Slight Drop in Shandong Coal Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rain and month-end accounting made the market exceptionally quiet. Total trading volume was less than 1,000 tons. Prices for Shandong coal fell slightly, with Xiaoshan Unified coal dropping 0.015 yuan per ton and Xihe Unified coal dropping 0.01 yuan.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Facing National Crisis Together</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>In my comments on ceasing civil war on August 3rd, I already stated that our country is vast and rich, but there are too many people with leadership ambitions. The only hope is for current military and political leaders to reduce their desire for leadership and instead take a practical, down-to-earth approach. Those capable of unifying a province should start by organizing one province. Those capable of unifying several provinces should start by organizing those provinces. Gain an inch, then another, and start from the beginning. Eventually, there will be a day of unification.</p>
<p>The other day, Mr. Wang Jingwei, in a speech commemorating the week at the Central Party Headquarters, discussed the Rehe problem and methods for facing the national crisis together. He proposed seeking unification through construction and joint governance through balanced power, which aligns with this idea. The only difference is that my construction proposal stemmed from the cessation of civil war, while Mr. Wang's proposal was for facing the national crisis together. If ceasing civil war, this proposal is a good remedy for the illness. If facing the national crisis together, releasing this proposal is like ["a slow doctor encountering a sudden wind"], truly as if the whip cannot reach the horse's belly.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's three methods are: First, the provinces that can be unified should have their difficulties resolved and be actively reorganized and built up, so that the people can live in peace and prosperity. In these provinces, set up a model of modern politics. Second, the provinces that nominally obey the Central Government but are not fully consistent should plan for unification through construction. Third, organize the people. These are all methods for organizing internal affairs during peacetime and not methods for jointly facing the national crisis, because these methods will definitely not be effective in one or two years. Distant water cannot put out a nearby fire.</p>
<p>Now, the national crisis is at hand, like a fire burning one's eyebrows. If we continue to leisurely reorganize the internal affairs, the national crisis will become reality, and there will be no hope of saving it. Therefore, my proposal is only ["I would rather be a shattered jade than an intact tile"], which is what Mr. Wang called ["If there is a gun or a bullet, we must resist to the death"]. No matter what the sacrifice, we must make the enemy pay a corresponding price. If our country has such an army, our people will do their utmost to assist. Ma Zhanshan, the 19th Route Army, and the 5th Army are examples.</p>

<h3>Autumn Night Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Yi Seng</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The bleak autumn wind and autumn rain, pitiful are the lands of Heilongjiang and Jilin. The Tartar tries to restore his country, but first loses it. The Jianzi garrison the border, but ultimately abandon it. The righteous soldiers struggle with the will to restore, the central court offers only lip service to resist. Don't lightly speak of the national crisis as an ordinary matter, only a few years have passed since the loss of Keelung and Taiwan.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Suddenly comes news of the generals and ministers evasive, the colors of the skies shift in the northern and southern capitals. Competing in emotion rather than facing foreign insults, unable to balance, the center is lost. The people of the East Province have sunk into a new country, the bandits of the Red Province have burdened the old corners. In such a country, in such a night, why cherish one's worthless head?</p>

<h3>Pine Needle Cotton Manufacturing Method</h3>
<p>— Jiang Tianlan</p>
<p>For artificial cotton, we only know about using rice straw, but we don't know that pine needles are also the only raw material for making cotton. Moreover, pine needles are cheaper than rice straw, and the profit is greater after making cotton. Anyone who cares about industry may wish to study pine needle cotton production.</p>
<p>However, the pine needle cotton manufacturing method that I know is to take old and strong pine needles, dry them in the sun, and then soak them in hot water at 60 degrees Celsius for about six hours. Take them out and add 1 part of water, 1 part of alcohol, and 1/5 part of yeast, mixing them well. Take a wooden board with several small holes, put a bamboo mat underneath, and add stones on top to press the pine needles down, so that they do not float on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>There should be holes in the cylinder cover to allow air to circulate. Then, fermentation gradually begins inside the cylinder, increasing the heat. The length of soaking depends on the warmness or coldness of the weather. Generally, it will foam in about two weeks. When the fermentation has reached the appropriate level, the wooden plug at the bottom of the cylinder can be pulled out to release the alkaline water. If there is still glue or oil in the leaves that does not dissolve in water, add a thin potassium hydroxide solution and mix it together, then introduce steam, the glue or oil will dissolve and flow out with the water. Wash with water and steam several times, and then let it dry appropriately.</p>
<p>At this time, if the skin cannot be completely removed, it can be placed in a round sieve and rotated quickly to separate the skin. Then, apply the final procedure to make it soft, place it in a mortar or on a flat board, cover it with coarse cloth, and pound it with a stick, then rub it finely through a sieve. The resulting fibrous material is pure cotton. The chips sifted out can be burned to make a kind of pine soot.</p>
<p>I am just broadly describing this method based on what I know, for experimental purposes. There is no shortage of inventors in the world, and there should be more detailed methods than this one. I am writing to ask for instruction.</p>

<h3>Should Mid- and Lower-Class Funeral Homes Be Established?</h3>
<p>— Zong Bai</p>
<p>Weddings and funerals are events that everyone experiences. However, most of society is made up of middle and lower-class people. The homes of middle-class people are usually just barely adequate. Sometimes two families share a residence, or even three. It goes without saying the homes of lower-class people are worse, and several people live in one room with a kitchen or a three-tiered shelf. When a celebratory event comes, one can borrow a restaurant or hotel. There are different levels for middle-class and lower-class people, but this does not need mentioning.</p>
<p>But when a funeral occurs, a big problem arises. If someone is about to die, the landlord will not allow them to die in the house, and the co-residents also dislike it. Sending them to the hospital, the doctor says there is no way to save their life, and the hospital cannot accept them. At that time, there is truly nowhere to go. One can only let them die in the street and then not know where to grab a place to collect the corpse and hold the funeral. Do you think middle and lower-class people suffer at this time? Not to mention lower-class people. Even for middle-class people, if they can die at home, and hold a funeral in a single-story house, there is no place to entertain relatives and friends who come to pay their respects. They inevitably have to use the alley outside the house, set up a bamboo shed, and put out some mismatched tables and chairs to entertain them. This is all without any way to think about it. If the weather is hot, with the sun at 100-some degrees, it is impossible to sit under the bamboo shed. If the weather is cold, with wind blowing from both sides, it is also impossible to sit. So, I think that funeral homes for the middle and lower classes should be established.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there is a magnificent Wanguo Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road, but it is only for the enjoyment of the upper class. Glass coffins, various ways to preserve the corpse, all kinds of expenses, it costs at least one or two thousand taels to move a hand. Lower-class people should not even talk about it. Middle-class people can only sigh with admiration. Therefore, middle and lower-class funeral homes should be planned for early. Everyone can imitate the methods of the Wanguo Funeral Home and treat it as a business organization. Shanghai is such a large place, with such a large population, that three or five funeral homes can be accommodated. Perhaps many people think that doing upper-class funerals can bring more profit. But the majority of society is made up of middle and lower-class people. If you take small profits but sell a lot, isn't it a good business? Moreover, these kinds of funeral homes don't require much capital. You only need to rent a house, the smaller one can be a double-story house, and the bigger one can be three-up and three-down. Use one or two employees, and don't decorate too lavishly. The way to make money is to charge rent to the bereaved family for renting the rooms, and to take a fair commission on the coffin and ceremonial arrangements. Wouldn't that be a good business? This is an easy undertaking, which is very beneficial to the lives of the people and the society. Why doesn't everyone try to start one? (For Discussion)</p>
<p>Dark Side</p>
<h3>Returning Disappointed</h3>
<p>— Flood</p>
<p>In this society where all industries are declining and there is economic panic, groups of people are wandering at crossroads, struggling with their lives. They want to find a job to make a living, but the shadow of ["few monks and much porridge"] is always flashing before your eyes. But what can be done?</p>
<p>Mr. Huang was fortunate enough to enter a certain cultural organization, filling a small clerical position. As far as I know, he receives a monthly salary of 30 yuan, and must provide his own room and board. Also, he must bear all of his family's expenses. In the family, there is a wife, a three-month-old baby, and a mother over half a century old, and they are all unable to produce. It is very obvious that it is difficult to maintain such a family with such income.</p>
<p>Because of the heavy pressure of life, his body became weaker day by day. Due to the harsh environment, it affected his willpower. He felt that everything from now on seemed to be drifting in a fog. He saw a group of sinister faces smiling maliciously at him, but he could not think of a way to deal with them. He had a way, but he did not have the courage to do it. One morning, Mr. Huang was reading the newspaper advertisements, and unconsciously saw an advertisement for a typing school, how low the tuition was, how useful it was to graduate... Mr. Huang's heart moved, and he smiled at the newspaper. As a result, he pawned a sheepskin robe and registered at a certain typing school because he wanted to gain a skill that could help him in life.</p>
<p>In that small Western-style pavilion, with four typewriters and a light bulb, was all the property of the school. A well-dressed teacher came to meet him and began to talk to Mr. Huang.</p>
<p>["Are you here to learn typing? Uh, your honorable name?"] The teacher looked up and asked.</p>
<p>["I am here to learn typing, I am called Huang Baiman, may I ask your honorable name, who is your principal?"]</p>
<p>["My last name is Zhu, I run this school. Now I want to talk briefly with Mr. Huang. The school course is divided into three classes: intensive, special, and ordinary. The intensive course can be graduated in one month, the special course in two months, and the ordinary course in three months. Once practiced, you can type with your eyes closed. Every graduate of this school is introduced into a company or bank... The salaries are quite large. Which class does Mr. Huang want to join?"] Principal Zhu asked, smiling from ear to ear.</p>
<p>["Intensive class!"] Mr. Huang blurted out. He thought to himself, although the school building has only one pavilion, judging from what Principal Zhu just said, the achievements in society are quite good, and the salaries of the students introduced are said to be quite large. At this time, Mr. Huang's mind was filled with the four words "great hope."</p>
<p>["Then, please pay the registration fee first! Two dollars, you can come to school tomorrow, and then pay the tuition of thirteen yuan, and the paper and supplies fee of two yuan. The registration fee is deducted from the tuition. If you don't come, it will not be refunded. The time is at your convenience, from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m."] Principal Zhu seemed to show a look of accommodating the students.</p>
<p>Three days later, Mr. Huang's tuition was already being forced to death by Principal Zhu. When he was practicing typing, Principal Zhu taught him with a disdainful look. So Mr. Huang used nine oxen and two tigers to barely pay the tuition in full. He thought that if he did not pay it off quickly, Principal Zhu would definitely see that he was a poor man, and he would definitely get a great obstacle, so it is better to please him early. However, the fact was exactly the opposite. After paying the tuition, this Principal Zhu always hid in his wife's room, singing the "Sister!... " tune very vigorously, as if Mr. Huang bought a ticket to listen to the opera. He did not give any guidance on typing methods, etc. Instead, when the time was about to come, Principal Zhu dragged his light leather shoes to the classroom to prepare to turn off the lights.</p>
<p>The graduation period arrived, and Principal Zhu routinely issued so-called graduation diplomas to the students, and naturally Mr. Huang was also given this grace.</p>
<p>["Huang Baiman, I will notify you when there is an opportunity, goodbye, goodbye!"]</p>
<p>["……………"]</p>
<p>On the way home, Mr. Huang sighed deeply. Not only was it not quick, but what is the use of taking a ready-made graduation diploma that can be bought for five cents in a bookstore? Not to mention having to fill in a one-yuan stamp himself? The expectation of helping in life is still in the deep clouds.</p>

<h3>The Birthday of the Three Officials</h3>
<p>— Yuechan</p>
<p>["Sister-in-law Huang, is today the 27th day of the seventh lunar month, the birthday of the Three Officials?" (sound inversion)], a middle-aged woman said to her cohabitant, a young woman holding a child.</p>
<p>["That's right, I forgot. I wanted to buy a foot tub because the one I bought last year for the Three Officials' birthday has rotted like tofu. Auntie Wu, are you going to buy anything?" Sister-in-law Huang said with a smile. ["Yes! My rice steamer is broken. I wanted to buy one on the 27th day of the first month (there are three 27th days in a year: the first, seventh, and tenth months), but I knew the celebrations were cancelled because of the war. I thought I'd buy one today, maybe it'll be cheaper, so I've waited until now. Let's go!"] Auntie Wu, always impatient, urged them on as usual.</p>
<p>["Oh dear! Why are you in such a hurry? Thank you, can you wait a moment?"]</p>
<p>["Then hurry up"]…</p>
<p>In a short while, Auntie Wu and Sister-in-law Huang, leading her four-year-old child, Sannan, left the shikumen and headed towards Lujiabang Road.</p>
<p>XXXXXXXX</p>
<p>Lujiabang Road in the Nanshi district, usually deserted, has been bustling with vendors these past few days, eager to do business. As a result, it has gradually become lively. Furniture, silk stockings, bamboo and rattan ware – all unsellable leftovers from the year – are being sold. They employ various methods to attract customers: ringing bells, striking their wares, shouting at the top of their voices, and even using peep shows with puppet shows, enticing people with the clanging of gongs and drums. It's a noisy and bustling scene.</p>
<p>["Mommy! I want to see the peep show!"] Sannan pleaded with her mother, Sister-in-law Huang.</p>
<p>["No, we didn't bring enough money,"] she said, putting on her motherly air, giving a reason why she couldn't let her watch.</p>
<p>Sannan knew her hopes for fun today were dashed, so she had to obediently follow them.</p>
<p>After all, people are never satisfied, especially women. They buy this and then want to buy that, and even if they already have it at home, they want to buy it again. They only cared about the cheap prices and didn't care about the quality of the goods. They bought over a dozen items in total, so many that they couldn't carry them all in their four hands. They had to hire a rickshaw. They let the rickshaw puller overcharge them by a dime or two. When they got home and thought about it carefully, they realized there was no real bargain. On the contrary, they had spent three or four dimes more on the rickshaw fare. They really felt it wasn't worth it.</p>
<p>Alas!</p>
<h3>Love and Bread</h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>The sky was not yet light, and the entire N village was immersed in sweet dreams. Two blurry figures suddenly emerged from the stone bridge at the pier, running quickly forward, as if carrying a major mission. The boat bound for Shanghai was docked beside the pier, as if waiting just for them. As soon as they boarded, it set off. Inside the boat, a dim oil lamp was lit, distinguishing them as a man and a woman. Their faces were flushed, and their chests were still heaving. They occupied a corner of the cabin. They smiled at each other, leaned on each other, and fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>At noon that day, N village was in an uproar about the elopement of a certain local gentry's daughter and the son of a grocery store owner; but the two of them said that free love had triumphed, and they had safely arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Those who have been in the river of love naturally understand that this is the most difficult moment to describe in life. In the big hotels and dance halls of the city: : in all areas of sin, they lived a romantic, carnal life. But this money pit quickly used up all the money they had stolen. It was only then that they realized that love was as important as bread. They moved from a big hotel into a small attic room, from a life of revelry to seeing the faces of rich friends. Money only goes out and doesn't come in. They felt slightly disappointed. By chance, they saw a classified advertisement for a secretarial position with a monthly salary of thirty yuan. He solemnly picked up his pen and wrote a few lines of regular script neatly for the first time, attached a detailed address, and mailed it out with great hope. That night, they thought they had found a new life, and they prepared some drinks and snacks in a very ["miserable"] (not abundant) way, encouraging them to forget their past disappointments and celebrate their future success. They spent a relatively pleasant evening like this.</p>
<p>When they woke up in the morning, from the next day onwards, they waited for a reply. But one day, two days… until they couldn't pay the second month's rent, and after they were disappointed again, they realized that bread was more important than love. On the one hand, they pawned things to make ends meet, and on the other hand, they were at a loss. They tried to find opportunities in the newspaper and discovered that a certain publishing house was soliciting manuscripts for a special issue of unknown writers. He thought he should work hard in this area. When he was in school before, he had served as the editor of the school magazine. He happily told her about this idea, and that night, he wrote a manuscript of ten thousand words. The next day, when the sun came up, he still didn't feel tired.</p>
<p>The special issue of unknown writers was finally published. They spent five dimes to buy it and saw that it was full of works by top writers in Shanghai. At the end, there was a submitted manuscript, and the editor's note said that the space was limited and could not include too much, and hoped that the unknown writers would continue to work hard, and that their publication was absolutely open.</p>
<p>He tore the book to pieces and remembered that she had said she was going to borrow money from a classmate's house and had not returned for three nights. He sighed deeply, ["Life is for bread, and doesn't need love"].</p>
