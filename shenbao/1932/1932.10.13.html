<p>時評</p>
<h3>生命線乎·又·玄</h3>
<p>東北三省因不抵抗而被强佔。使我東北天府淪於異族統制之下。三千萬人民備嘗亡國之痛。乃日人於强取豪奪之餘。復造作危言以驅策其國内人民。故爲善語以惑亂國際觀聽。日人之言曰。「滿洲者日本之生命線也。」其詮釋之義。則爲彼之國防第一線也。非擁有「滿洲」不足以保障朝鮮之安全。</p>
<p>朝鮮之安全不保。則日本之本地可危。其次則蘇聯虎視耽耽。第一五年計劃。專心於蘇俄本境之一切建設。第二次五年計劃。於指正社會主義途徑邁進之外更將肆力開發西比利亞。　　以及於北滿。如果吉黑受「赤氛」包圍。則非特「南滿」之日本利益不保。即朝鮮亦將不爲日本所有矣。再次則爲日本對華投資數逾二十五萬萬日金。而投下在「南滿」一帶者幾達二十萬萬元。近年以來我國民族醒覺。漸次普遍。東北雖開發較遲而民族獨立之自覺。則與東南先進諸省分無大懸殊。一般中小產業。皆有起而與日本競爭之勢。於是日人危懼。乃借用武力。將經濟的競爭轉化而爲政治的侵略。彼亦自知其未必能一手掩盡天下耳目。故自號於國中曰。「滿洲者日本之生命線也。」　　其實東三省之開發。日俾兩國僅具剌激之力。而胼手胝足晝夜辛勤。冒風雪披荆棘。以從事於東北三省之開發。出力最多受酬最少者。我國冀魯諸省之移民也。以最客觀眼光察之。（即日人中亦多云然）東北天候過於寒冷。一般生活標準過於低下。實不適宜於日本之農業移民。試以近二十五年日本管理南滿鐵道以來。用盡種種方法獎勵日本「移民。」給與日本「移民。」以一切生活上及事業經營上之莫大便利。而日本人之住居於東三省境内。關東州所屬不過十萬零一千人。沿南滿路及其他支線。凡歸日本領事館直轄之日本「移民。」亦僅九萬零三百餘人。再加各色浪人及未在日領館註册者。合計最大限亦不出二十萬人。以二十萬人口。竟至出十萬大軍以保護之。所謂「生命線」也者固如是乎。而經此次大擾亂之後。日本興師動衆。以擢奪我土地。（我國雖號稱保存實力。實際損失土地及鑛藏之外。亦不下百萬萬元。）然計其「移民。」自去年九月迄於今年九月。亦不過五百户。而武裝亦僅四百二三大人。所謂「生命線」者乃如是乎。</p>
<p>我中國者除極少數之漢奸而外。雖日處彼帝國主義的軍隊鐵蹄蹂躪之下。懾於淫威。有淚祇好和血呑向腹内。欲哭而不敢聲。奈何亦莫能喚。然而義勇軍此仆彼起。甘以血肉之軀與鋼鐵爭短長。其行動誠不免乎愚拙。其精神則堪千古。且也日本自以爲志得意滿。有一般漢奸足供其驅使。而乃撥亂反正。願爲民族爭光者。馬占山之後。繼之以蘇炳文張殿九。使日本金錢收買。盡失其效。我中國民族在東北三省最後一點生機。更儼然存在。目前一時勝敗。誠不易確知。即使邊遠孤軍。因餉彈兩缺至於不能支持。而民族爭鬭之種子。已遍佈於東北三千萬華人「心田」之中。若干時日之後。勢必一齊怒發。復國運動。其期亦未必遙遠。彼日本自去年九一八掀起變亂以來。一般工商損失。姑不具論僅就陸海軍軍費迄今年九月爲止。其實數已起過三萬萬四千萬圓日金。來年度豫算。僅陸軍用費。亦必在二萬萬圓以上。其得究有幾何耶。僅愈激我民族反抗而已。愈增列國嫉視而已。</p>
<p>此外。北美合衆國。早已公佈其非承認主義。雖於日本侵占東北。無大直接影響。而此種露骨「否認。」使日本不能由危懼而警戒。而大量增加海軍。以備一旦事變之突然來襲也。同時潛伏於冰天雪地之蘇聯。此刻固競競於其内部建設。對外僅取機敏的靜觀形勢。然其嚴整軍備。秣馬厲兵。已爲世所共知。日本旣奪取東北三省。直接衝突之機乃愈多。（現時日蘇兩國之漁業協定煤油協定等。具屬短時期中之利害結合。且中蘇未復交。蘇聯對日。亦不能不採取一種有效的外交策略。故目前此種諒解。爲時必暫。）日蘇衝突之機旣愈多。則日本在東北之戒備。必愈嚴重。是日本之海陸雙方。隨時均處於被夾攻之形勢下矣。再加以農困於野。（米價低落）工困於市（工資减輕）商困於營業衰頽。（物價高漲）如之何其能併呑中國。北侵蘇聯。東戰美國乎。　　日本軍閥之侵略心理。匪僅欲獨覇「滿洲。」并有侵我華北向長江流域運其軍事蠻力之勢。英國處此。恐亦未必不生疑懼而與日分離。則日本他日在國際間。在東亞所處地位。乃大戰前德意志所處之地位也。苟一旦惹起列國之環攻。將應騐内田康哉「全國變爲焦土··」之語耶。所謂「生命線」也者。其果爲生命線乎。抑爲「摧命線」乎。</p>

<p>二一枝譚</p>
<h3>同時打破悶葫蘆</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>倘是用着封神榜的筆法描寫這麽一回事，　　一定要說：有三位上界星君，各各背着一個大葫蘆，脚踏雲頭，分向日内瓦南京東京去走一遭；同在一個時候·揭開這葫蘆蓋兒。不開時，萬事全休；揭開時，忽喇喇的一聲響亮，霎時騰起霞光萬道　，耀得五洲萬國的人民，一個個眼花撩亂。也有撫掌的，也有搖頭　的，也有吐舌的，也有怒目的；這三個同樣的大葫蘆，簡起是奇妙不可思議的大葫蘆！</p>
<p>國聯的調查報告書，業已發表了。世界各國的輿論，對於這葫蘆裏的藥品，有滿意的，也有不滿意的。凡是滿意的，認爲葫蘆有絶大的價値；分明是金葫蘆，銀葫蘆，八寳葫蘆，神仙葫蘆。凡是不滿意的，又嫌着葫蘆裏面的藥品含有油滑性，分明是個油葫蘆；含有酸澀性，分明是個醋葫蘆；含有麻醉性，分明是個酒葫蘆。</p>
<p>究竟葫蘆裏面的藥品，是仙丹還是爛藥？在不曾化騐以前，依舊是一個奇妙不可思議的悶葫蘆！</p>
<h3>瞄準</h3>
<p>— ·台·生</p>
<p>火候還没到家|</p>
<p>東北的北大營兵工廠旣瞄準轟炸於先，再來一個瞄準閘北轟擊砲台。而且都瞄得不錯，没有差過幾個基羅密特。</p>
<p>這是表明敵人平日能對巷戰野戰上用功夫，一上槍，祗見彈珠得得，要就不瞄，要瞄定準！</p>
<p>至於我們的瞄準手段呢？除了黑山白水山凹叢林中有班健兒能使敵人膽寒以外，餘外能瞄得準確射得中的槍手，據說也還在實際訓練之中！</p>
<p>或者有人不相信，以爲說少點，民國廿一年的長期訓練，連瞄準的功夫都不會麽，這廿一年中間，紛紛攘攘，你對我瞄準，我對你瞄準，有時玩得好，果然也還大家招呼一聲，來一個明槍明彈，然後排定佈置了陣勢，再行大家瞄準，但有時玩意兒玩得不上腔，弄毛了的時候，給你個冷冷的瞄準，來不及還手，來不及防。</p>
<p>這樣手段，還算錯麽？能把這一「把勢」掉轉槍口，不是也儘夠能把東北收回，踏平三島！</p>
<p>然而，一向以謙遜和平的我們的槍手，也還都是「自歉不遑」的說，「火候」還没到家，要再演習演習，再行出馬罷！</p>
<p>於是大家仍把槍口互相瞄準，實槍實彈的穿胸貫腹公演於世界！</p>
<p>我們，祇得暗暗焦灼，等待這班槍手「火候」到家的時候，再把槍口向外對外瞄準吧。</p>
<h3>村童鄕女的歌謠</h3>
<p>— ·君·碩</p>
<p>頗有比興諷諫意義|</p>
<p>古時輶軒採風，不遺民俗歌謠，爲其有裨政敎，政府所不厭詳求的。後世亦有田野山歌，出諸村童鄕女的口中，合得古詩人比興的意義！且似諷諫的聲口。假使有人採集爲歌謠箴勸的書本，或有么引導兒童，似乎也合得新敎育的原理。姑以所聞，略貢一二，不知能否不見嗤於大雅君子？</p>
<p>一心要想上高山，脚底下的草鞋做弗來，白米飯好吃田難種啊，鮮　魚好吃網難攀。</p>
<p>這種山歌，在詩的六義中看來，可算合得比的一義。口中說想上高山，居然有志向上！然而上山的草鞋，郤又做他不來，一定是不能自勉自奮，只好在山脚下看人上山而已。下面兩句，說到欲享權利，須盡義務，豈不是很明白曉暢麽？</p>
<p>紅鳳仙，白鳳仙，爺娘養我弗周全，晚娘推我靑草裏，巿草開花亦可憐。</p>
<p>此歌合得興的一義·朱子云，『興者，先言他物，引起所詠之詞。』鳳仙兩句，即先言他物，下面再及後母虐待。末句又似含得比的意義，深可玩味。</p>
<h3>反常怕事</h3>
<p>— 態·乙·未·生</p>
<p>糖炒栗了攤和小食館之類|</p>
<p>我國人習性，對於許多事情都喜歡自秘，尤其中屬於技術之類。每於所得，便深自珍秘，不得其人，便不肯輕於傳授；卽使傳授，也往往把最重要最高深的那一部份保留着，直等到十二萬分放心的時候才肯拿出來敎給他最信任的門徒。俗語說：「敎敎了徒弟，没有了師傅」就是這意思。上海話呌作：「賣關子。」因此你想在中國的匠工手裏學會一件精通的技藝，煞非易事。然而我近來却發見了一件反常的事態，那就是得之於糖炒栗子攤和許多小食館飯館之類的。粮炒栗子這種工技，雖不能說是十分神秘，然而至少也可以抵得住陸稿薦的醬肉醬鴨等東西。據說陸稿薦的醬肉醬鴨的烹製，是用一種祖傳的秘法，其中還有一段足以令十九世紀頭腦驚美的神話。然則糖炒栗子也應該照樣深自珍秘了；可是他們非但不自珍秘，而且十分公開；每一個糖炒栗子的攤子，必定在當門擺設爐灶，怎樣放糖，怎樣放砂，怎樣放栗，怎樣加柴用火，怎樣用鏟攪撥，怎樣從砂堆裡篩出栗子來，一一宣示無遺，弄得馬路旁邊烟霧騰騰，店門前炭灰遍地。小食館小飯館之類呢，在他們店堂後面，不盡是没有可以安置爐灶，陳設刀砧的地方，可是他們却偏要所廚房設在店堂前面，甚或設正當門，那一陣陣的煤氣和油氣腥氣，令食客覺得有點不可逈邇。這兩業，我覺得他們太把技術公開了。也許他們以爲鑊子裡呈出的色香，含有，有力的廣告作用，這就不可知。在我的意思，可勸他們還是秘密一點好，因爲赤膊着在工作的技師會呌異國人聯想到非洲或印度。</p>
<h3>仙境般的淸晨</h3>
<p>— ·茸·餘</p>
<p>是在鄕間，不在上海|</p>
<p>居住上海的我，夜夜睡在鴿棚式的房間裏，一覺醒來，總學得心胸煩悶，呼吸不暢。你要跑得靜安寺路兜兜吧！又要難爲你的尊足；而且沿路上糞車，垃圾車，亦使得你難受。咳！上海的淸晨|中午|晚上|午夜|又到了明天的淸晨，總是一股　囂，一股腥臭。居住在這裏的人，壽命上總要打一個折扣。</p>
<p>在這幾個月裏，我因職務的關係，搬到鄕間來住，那個地方，離開燬滅大上海的焦點|虹口公園|有六里路，離開江灣鎭也有六城，出進雖是不便些，可是都市生活的沉迷，熱閙，煩囂，一掃而光。</p>
<p>我每天早上五點鐘起來，總要到田岸上去跑一周。那時草上的露滴，像明珠般的閃閃發光。秋露飽吸的露水，精神抖擻的呌着。遠望樹林裏的一股水汽，未經太陽光的蒸發，好像雲霧般一起一伏。道時天空是淸潔的；大地是沉靜的，一股淸晨的早氣，撲到鼻管裏來，正像甘露般凉澈心胸。</p>
<p>點綴這淸晨的其麽呢？幾家茅屋，烟囱上的烟，裊裊的上昇天空。一泓溪水的旁邊，强健而天然美的村姑，正在淘米洗菜。一羣羣的鷄鴨，從棚裏出來，在塲上尋食。樹上的小鳥，亦開始向人們道早安！</p>
<p>東方的太陽出來了。每塊田裏，總有幾個鄕人，老的小的男的女的都有，鋤草的鋤草；種菜的種菜。大路上亦有前呼後應的邪許聲，原來是鄕有挑了蔬菜，到上海去出賣。</p>
<p>這樣的散步了一周，兩脚微微覺得酸麻，看看臂上的手錶，正指六下。我想在大上海的跳　舞塲裏，摩登的靑年男女們，剛剛惺忪着眼睛回去睡眠咧！</p>
<h3>名劇得失記</h3>
<p>— ·梯·公</p>
<p>國慶前一夕，蘇財廳舒石父君，爲其令媛于歸。田莘前輩，特邀爾爾社同人堂會於貴州路之湖社。臨畤，忽有朱施二小姐，加入坐宮。四郎嗓雖細，而善用，韻味極佳，小番嘎調，尤一鳴驚人，公主扮相美極，使腔恪守繩墨，非徒以　巧炫人。是皆時下女票之不可多得者。有云二者之一，爲馮耿光君姬人。不知確否，而是夕馮君料量奔走，因嘗碌碌也。</p>
<p>七日夕，某巨室壽慶，社友晦厂，爲代邀徐子權君串狀元譜。君尊人凌雲老人，曲界名宿，淵源家學，非同凡響。况君更特約兪振飛君爲輔，同人方喜耳福匪淺。詎意主人竟嫌不吉，婉請易碼。君遂託疾不至，并羣英會之蔣幹，本允爲愚配演者，亦連帶爽約，惆悵奚如。兩名劇。一則得之無意，一迺失諸交臂，一飲一啄，信有前定也。</p>
<h3>入關郵侶（十）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主</p>
<p>魯伯勤雖與伊訂交已數月之久，郤還是第一遭發現伊有這樣絶頂的華貴與艷麗，幾非平日意境中所能想像。在伊是女爲悅己者容，特在家裏掉了個槍花，說是女友相邀出遊，才故意有這番修飾。而伯勤在驚眩之下，不覺靈魂也會喊呌起來，竟又給與他一個嚴重的詔示：|似這樣天仙般的愛人，本是屬於你的；只要你輕輕一點頭，順從伊的主張，你們立刻就可携手偕行，到别一極樂世界結成神仙眷屬，，同享最美滿的幸福了。你如今若還要拘執那迂腐之見，拒絶了伊，不獨這可愛的人會立時失去，你不見得能割捨；而且眼前當着伊這可喜的春風面，你又豈能眞忍心做得出，便與伊一種斬釘截鐵不近人情的拒絶，招伊對你傷心失望達於極點嗎？|這樣一想，他幾乎軟化得再没有半點氣力，把昨夜所熟籌而又堅定了的一種决絶的主張，要整個兒推翻，壓根兒放棄了呢。</p>
<p>佟一貞徐徐把肩上横着的綢傘，放下來收起；另伸直個纖纖玉指，慕地向他那看得出神的視線上，横掠一下，笑嘻嘻的說：</p>
<p>「傻子！你又在發的什麽呆？老瞪了眼珠子釘住我，雖道我今天這樣的打扮不好看嗎？」</p>
<p>魯伯勤微微一震動，忙回答道：「很好！很好！」</p>
<p>「眞好嗎？」佟一貞又嫣然的笑了。隨又把綢傘擱在魯伯勤膝上，在他身旁貼近着的另一石鼓上坐安，再提起了正文：「我知道你没有不說我好的，也没有不愛我的，昨天所說的那件事，你該有了極痛快的答復了罷？」</p>
<p>「？？？？？」他還是沈默着。</p>
<p>「這是關係我終身幸福的大事啊！你怎麽說是猶豫不决？好人！别敎我多灼急了，快答復我罷」。伊雖然已有了點焦急和慍怒，但仍是柔聲媚氣的催促。</p>

<h3>紗花紗市午後大鬆</h3>
<p>標紗市情始平繼跌趨勢甚疲、因環境不良、蜀魯兩處皆有戰事、以致人心愈弱、且賣方有交解現貨之說、壓力尤重、於是一般散多稍有斬結市盤愈落、榮興之多頭亦賣出、現紗客銷更覺岑寂、本月份最低曾見一百四十五兩云、</p>

<h3>棉市虚弱</h3>
<p>棉市晨漲午跌、但美棉回漲十餘磅音、惟本埠人心頗虚、因某廠商抛賣仍多、壓力愈重、兼之國内天氣順調、利於新花、各廠以紗銷而凄凉、對於採原料心思愈淡、故市上實需頗淸、市面呆滯云、</p>

<h3>糧食天晴米價跌勢愈厲</h3>
<p>滬南昨日内地來源約四十餘號、浦積豐厚、市銷寂寞、人心看低究緣洋米棧存充足、常錫陳貨頂跌近角、普通宿次乏人過問用落三尺、新粳百哥窰中白稻等貨胃口寥寥亦跌二三角、洋杜尖無榮辱全日浦江斛脚約一千石左右、</p>
<p>新閘昨日來源尙湧、城鄉店銷呆滯、常州江陰新粳頂貨批落三四尺、與南市同跌靑浦·松江·楓涇·嘉善等窰中白稻、來貨略接、鄉胃仍細、價短二角、洋埠尖到銷二平、趨勢平疲、變陰元酒胃淸淡、市形站定</p>
<h3>洋米本銷活動</h3>
<p>湘米新到五百包|</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、本街胃口突見活動數日來疲滯之市面似又蘇息、惟行情則被杜客各尖旺到之影響、價乃繼續下跌、比之上週末售開者較小近角、統市開出一號西貢一千餘包價九元零五公至九元一角小絞五百包價、七元七角至六角半、統係本街及零星散户辦去</p>
<p>湘米因搬運不划、久無到貨、昨日運到五百包、因該地成本已低、販户略爲裝惟昨日尙未售開云</p>
<h3>粉市急轉直下</h3>
<p>昨日粉市中下午開盤後近遠各月份一致急轉直下、因洋麥電訊雖見報漲但以美國賒麥已有八日簽字之確訊且定於十一月中裝華、共計粉十五萬噸麥钴十萬噸、他日蛭埠影響於市面者必鉅、故大小各廠一致旺出、市面乃逐盤下跌無可挽救收市價本月小一分七五十一月小二分七五十二月小二分半、一月小二分半、二月小二分二五、三月小二分、</p>
<h3>麥價步步下落</h3>
<p>昨日麥市、期貨被美國賒麥影響行家抛套甚力空多兩方均有售出、市價乃步步下跌、午後遠期疲勢更銳、因洋麥均在遠月抵華抛套者均注意遠期也收市三月祇小二分下月小五分、十二月小七分、一月小八分、二月小八分、三月小七分、現麥開四千包、由阜豐等各廠辦去、計江北麥三兩四錢三分、六合麥三兩四錢、五河麥三兩四錢七分揚州麥三兩四錢至三兩三錢八分瑤灣麥三兩四錢半、</p>

<h3>絲茶歐美絲電轉滬寥落</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市仍無生氣、緣歐美絲電仍鮮轉滬、川魯絲商鑒於時局不靖、來源告阻、廠絲商以工潮起伏無常、態度消極、昨祇開利進木機揚返十三至十五條份川黃廠經十五包、價扯五百兩、中和進童鶴牌頂頭號七里白乾經十包、價四百三十五兩、</p>
<h3>川絲頭來源告阻</h3>
<p>川省二劉發生政爭、戰事業已爆發、川輪航運艱困、川絲頭來源告阻、僅郵包尙有運滬、然均限於高等絲頭、是以下脚如川巾子·尾巴·挽手等滬存不充駐滬川絲商均已愼重抛售矣、</p>
<h3>珍眉綠茶銷滯價低</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶市、近來益形黯淡、路莊土莊之珍眉、銷路尤爲呆滯、其原因實由日茶廉價競銷所致、昨屯莊珍眉、同孚洋行雖有少數電訊交易、但售盤又跌四五兩、惟貢熙一項、俄國協𦔳會進意仍未鬆懈、白頭莊鑒於市上存逐漸枯薄亦多紛紛補充缺額雖售盤極低、交易尙不寂寞云、</p>
<h3>油市落令後之桐油</h3>
<p>洪江桐油中秋後、本已落令今庚卽當銷之際、亦不能發展蓋因江浙兩省連年荒欠、人民以開門七件尙難維持焉有餘錢從事髹添、且値滬上兵災之後、内地金融、咸受影響、農村經濟瀕於破產、百業凋零、洪油僅仗内銷、丁此年令、無從發展、已爲市上所公認、所幸產地各榨坊、深知此中原委、咸將產額减少、免遭擱置、此亦根本解决也、職是之故、銷雖一蹶不振、而來源又非往年可比、所以市上堆積、尙不致滿坑滿谷、而市面亦無一瀉千里之勢以久疲聲中尙能勉力維持過去、亦產消支配之得宜也、現時已届落令、若以往年而衡、則尙有尾聲、乃今庚未到中秋、早已銷聲匿跡、致現在幾無市面可言所賴各處存積不厚、銷塲之有無、均不在意中、市面雖疲、尙能穏立、本埠售價以副牌慶元豐爲正市、餘牌按格升降、此後銷場旣淸而到亦無、預計無甚榮辱可言也、</p>
<h3>煤炭山西煤回漲五錢</h3>
<p>山西白煤、因來貨衆多、存煤擁積、市價頻跌、每噸自上春由十九兩直跌至十四兩五錢、一般同行店家、競相收買最近來貨不多、存煤頗感稀缺、故昨市場呌開盤子每噸回起五錢、仍售十五兩云、</p>

<h3>三角戰</h3>
<p>— ·佛</p>
<p>我早已說過，中國的事，打天然弄不好，不打也弄不好，索性打，索性大打，但是打要打得痛快，打得澈底。</p>
<p>任何主義我相信，武力主義，天然也不是例外，但總以澈底痛快爲條件，中國人只會殺中國人，不會殺外國人，也是我國人的特性，現當國難嚴重時期，而我國一般軍閥先生們，又開了大門專演「煎荳」的好戲，起初則魯省的韓劉，繼則川省的二劉，今則閩省的好戲也已開幕了，故觀察現在的情形，而推測將來的趨勢，不但是三角戰，或者四角戰五角戰，以至於無數角戰，將應運而起，</p>
<p>不用說，他們的戰，一定有戰的道理，戰的理由，但是不去對外，專門對内，任何說法，總恐無以自圓其說，現在他們旣經開幕，我是不反對他們的打，亦無法反對他們的打，索性請他們打，不過我最不喜歡聽這樣的一類話，甲說我擁護某某而戰，乙說我擁護某某而戰，老實說句話，擁護某某而戰，也不過爲擴張自己的地盤，不擁護某某而戰，到底也爲擴張自己的地盤，索性痛痛快快說，我爲自己而戰，我爲自己地盤而戰，我倒拜服，</p>
<p>眞正的好軍隊，决不會擁護自己，也不會擁護别人，只曉得擁護國家，若軍隊能個個如此，自然會站在一條戰線之上，若擁護某某，就是支某某爲招牌，而保持自己的利益，若某某受他人的擁護，亦無非欲借他人的力量，以樹個人的勢力，結果仍是黨派紛歧，門户各别，弄來弄去，依舊是不澈底，不痛快</p>

<h3>感時次杜工部秋興韻（續）</h3>
<p>— ·金·靄·士</p>
<p>纔開眞面見廬山，變態依然瞬息間，猶自鬩牆增魯難，任他敵騎陷邊關，淪夷昔有漢蘇節，返渡今無楚項顏，滿地萑苻何足異，沐猴况復點朝班，</p>
<p>爛羊何事苦爭頭，同室戈操廿一秋</p>
<p>，撤盡藩籬招外侮，飄零骨肉繫離愁，風驚鶴唳如談虎，浪捲鯨波怎狎鷗，人禍天災相逼甚，那堪回首話神州，</p>
<p>辱成和約棄全功，依舊金迷紙醉中，獵艷舞殘銅夜漏，徵歌圍作肉屏風，　蒲戲惑貪心黑，罌栗花開照眼紅，軍閥不知亡國恨，尙爭鷸蚌利漁翁，</p>
<p>東南半璧勢逶迤，大澤鴻嗷月滿陂，苫蓋只今多覆被，鷦鷯從此罕棲枝，杜陵營厦寒誰庇，鄭俠披圖刦未移，吟罷楚狂徒感慨，問天無語夕陽埀，（不受酬）</p>

<p>我們每天吃的食物，若放置數日，便發生不堪近鼻的惡臭，和不可入口的惡味；這種惡臭和惡味就是食物的腐敗，凡食物的腐敗，是因爲空氣内有許多微生物，到處飛散，倘遇着食物，便寄生在上面，產出酵素，使食物發酵，漸漸分解，以致腐敗啊，這種微生物的繁殖力很强，不但能寄生在食物裏面，並且能繁殖到動植物的體内，或人體的血液裏，我們若讓牠跑到食物中，吃了下去，不但是不衛生，而且要生病，所以我們吃的食物，應當用下面四種方法中的一種來保存喲。</p>
<p>（一）乾燥法，黴菌和細菌，都要在濕潤的食物上面纔能寄生；如把食物中含有的水分，用日光曬乾，或用火爐烘乾，使黴菌和細菌不能寄生，雖放置多日，也就不容易腐敗了。這是呌做乾燥防腐法。</p>
<p>（二）寒冷法，黴菌和細菌，遇着食物的溫度，和攝氏的普冰點相近，就不能繁殖；所以當夏季天氣很熱的時候，把食物放到冰箱裏去，過了一兩天，仍和新鮮的一樣，這是呌做寒冷防腐法。</p>
<p>（三）加熱法，黴菌和細菌，遇着食物</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>的溫度，和攝氏的沸點相近，便不能生活；所以市上出售的罐頭食物，就是先把食物裝入洋鐵罐内，外面用火加熱，等熱到沸點以上，便把罐口密密的封好，罐裏的食物，便能久藏不腐，這是呌做加熱防腐法。</p>
<p>（四）藥物法，黴菌和細菌，不能在食鹽或蜜糖的裏面繁殖；所以吾人常食的鹹肉，鹹魚，鹹菜等，都是用食鹽醃漬的，就是藏了多日，味仍鮮美。又市上出售的蜜餞菓品，都是有蜜糖浸漬的，也可以貯藏多日，不致變味，這是呌做藥物防腐法。</p>

<h3>討論改良宗祠管理問題</h3>
<p>— ·王·士·本</p>
<p>中國人的宗族觀念，比較國家觀念，來得深重，所以富貴人家，都在本族中，募集若干資產，創設宗祠一所，作爲救濟族中孤寡貧苦的一種機關，並爲供奉祖先神位，及舉行祭祀的一個處所，在這種宗祠，設立了以後，對於一族中的貧苦人家，故然受益不少，可以减少一族中的不良的事情發生，保全一族的整個名譽，因之這個宗祠的設立，眞夠也非常重要的，但是這種宗祠，考之實際方面，除了爲少數的救濟族中貧苦，及供那無知的神位外，簡直没有别的利益可尋，並且都是辦理不善，缺乏良好的規例，來管理，和保障，所以每見很大的一所宗祠，被經管者，亂七八糟弄了數年，就實行破產，使先人苦心擘劃經營的事業，就此毀滅，言之不勝浩歎，所以現在寫了幾句，改良管理的方法出來，以作管理和保障宗祠上的討論，</p>
<p>（一）管理條例欲這種宗族的團體，保持永久，第一要取銷舊有的董事制度，因爲谊種制度，無非是把整個宗祠的權柄，付之一二人之手，弄得發生侵呑公欵，侵占公產，甚之把合族公有的祠產，視爲個人私產，任意取求，結果，無不促成宗祠破產，所以要打破這種不良的弊竇，必須把這種不良的董事制度取銷，另行設立宗祠管理委員會，由合族人士，推舉若干族中爲人公正，辦事幹練的人，來擔任委員，每年改選一次，以防日久頑生，這委員會的職權，包括管理關於宗祠上的，應興應革的事宜，及辦理族中一切公共事業，至於牠内部的組織，可分若干股，如經濟，事業·敎育·財產·雜務·等股，分頭辦事，有條不紊，對於祠内一切收進支出賬目，應半年或一年，公佈一次，以昭財政公開之大信，一方面，合族的人士，也要隨時監督，和指導，這樣方可免去獨裁侵私等弊竇發生，祠業也得以埀之永久了，</p>
<p>（二）辦理事業每見現有的宗祠，除了年終，施放若干糧米，於族中貧苦寡孤，及四時八節，祭祀祖先，兩事外，無其他的事業可尋，所以宗祠貢獻於一族的利益，亦渺乎其淺呢，現在應當把祠中公欵收入中，提出若干，辦理宗族學校一所，使得族中貧苦子弟，有入學的機會，减少族中文盲的人數，提高一族對外的地位，另外再設宗族圖書館一所，採辦若干關於社會·家庭·農業·醫藥等，一類有益書報，置備其間，可使合族人士，有研究學問，增進智識的機會，並可有陶養德性，舒展精神的處所，因之得以造成族中優秀人材，免得墮落整個宗族的名譽，其外對於祭祀等制度，亦應改良，總之，以切於實際的經濟的，爲前提，取銷舊有的，虚僞的，奢侈的，一切舉動，至於怎樣改良，可由委員會内的事業股，草訂詳細規條，分别停行可了，</p>
<p>因爲中國的民族團體，實際方面，是以宗族團體爲單位，所以努力地，把宗祠問題，改良得好了，才後有好的民衆，有了好的民衆，才後國家可以强盛了，現在限於篇幅，不能細細地，舉出改良的方法來，不過約略舉其犖犖大者，提出討論，請會員諸君，不吝賜敎是幸。</p>
<p>病源</p>
<h3>肺結核患者</h3>
<p>— ·惠</p>
<p>他帶着疲乏和創痛的心，蹣跚地拖着沉重而遲緩的步子走回宿舍裏。一踏進門，有一陣悶氣衝人欲嘔，他忙開了小窗，從袋裏摸出兩只裝滿藥水的玻璃瓶順手放要堆滿了書，酒瓶和散亂着稿紙的桌上。他的兩條腿再也不能支持他笨重的身子了，他頽廢地靜默着躺在牀上，但他還不住在氣喘嗆咳。</p>
<p>宿舍是這麽矮小而黑暗，再加之秋雨纏綿，室裏更覺陰鬱沉悶而增加他的傷感。他拿起適才醫生給他的診斷書，眼角裏潮濕了，他想：「聽說肺病到了第三期是不可藥救了的！啊，完結了！醫生呌靜養，少思想和操，勞但賣文過生活的窮人也有不思想少操勞的權利麽？而且，這顆受了劇創的破碎的心，還能夠鎭靜而呌它不慘痛不振盪呀？··完了，完了！哈哈，甚麽都完了喲！·····」</p>
<p>他漸漸地像發狂了；慘白的瘦臉上，慢慢的浮出赭赤，心裏燃燒着，喉間感覺激劇的燥癢，他爬起來用力大聲嗆咳，好半天，口裏覺得一陣奇腥，胸頭浮動，最後咯出一口痰來，吐在紙杯裏，他發現痰裏跳躍着的鮮紅的一絲一絲的而以又腥臭的東西，他望着，眼前昏黑了，全身疲軟，重躺下來。</p>
<p>一個可咒詛的傷心的時代在他的眼前重新展開了。在這個時代的開始，誰不欣羨他是時代的幸運兒？即他自己在和他的她變愛到白熱度的時候，他幻夢也没想到悲劇之幕就是那個時候揭開的。這是當他在失學後再度會晤她的時候，他發覺她已軟綿綿的笑躺在那個大肚子的懷裏了。在他。這當然足以呌他發狂的事，雖說他很明白這建築在物質上而爲經濟條件所支配的戀愛，對於他，這是必然的結果。但曾在他心上佔有的一個深刻的印痕，任他如何洗滌，總留有些許糢糊的影子！這些影子和少許淺薄的理智便在他的内心裏交相衝突和矛盾！有時他很知道没有和不懂愛情的女子結合，是極幸運的事，從此他正可以向事業求發展；但，同時間，那個嬌憨的可愛的影子浮現了，他重回味到甜和酸，於是人的心痛，他便起了殺人的惡念，當他望見了白亮亮的利刃，他的手又顫抖得不能自主，心兒狂躍使他撑持不住身子，勇氣消失盡了！有時，他憤怒：「女人，甚麽東西？··不是金錢可以交易的物品麽？··」這是必然的，他的痛苦和鬱悶只有沉醉在肉市裏求解除了！狂歡，瀾飲，是的啊，他深深的走入狂歡瀾飲的自殺之路去了！</p>
<p>喉間總是燥癢，他不住地嗆咳；痰裏的血絲，他已看慣了，他不再像開始的恐怖和驚惶，因爲他曉得肺結核到了第三期是不可藥救了的。</p>
<p>生活的片段</p>
<h3>少婦日記</h3>
<p>— ·吾</p>
<p>九月十六日</p>
<p>我們的生活完全和去年兩樣了。去年常感覺着生活的甜味，而現在却是孩子的奴隸了。</p>
<p>阿B爲了家庭過於負重，整天的在外面忙着，我們談話的時間没有了，就連Miss的時間也没有了。</p>
<p>了許久的　　，今天　了六角六洋診治，顯然的好了許多。本來醫生要我明天再去的，當然，我得徵求丈夫的同意，可是他只怱忙的應着「隨便你」那末爲了節省用度，爲了體念他賺錢的難困，我只好忍着痛讓創口慢慢的痊愈。</p>
<p>不過近來阿B愈益給生活折磨了，煩悶的心情。常使他對於一切都感覺厭煩：譬如這對我漠不關心的態度，都是去年所没有的。</p>
<p>九月十九日</p>
<p>爲了家庭經濟的支絀，爲了小孩兒的偶然傷風，我們常是相駡，甚至於一點兒小事，也没有好的商量的。簡直比不上舊式家庭的和好。</p>
<p>不過，我應當負大部份的責任，因爲我不能更進一步的去體貼他，原諒他。啊·我是多麽笨啊！</p>
<p>然而再是這樣繼續下去，我眞感覺可怕。苦痛煩悶。</p>
<p>小孩兒長得越發可愛了，正因爲他的可愛，使我覺得憂愁，不是嗎？假如没有這個孩子的話，我的整個的心便是屬於丈夫的了。</p>
<p>近來每晚都苦於失眠，阿B却一上床便疲倦的睡着了。他過於疲勞，他的臉瘦削得露骨，簡直像一具骷髏。</p>
<p>記得去年我們在物質上苦到萬分，然而精神却是十分愉快的。没有了米，阿B自己爭着吃粥，而將飯留給我吃，呀！那時多麽美好啊！現在呢，我有時買了一點自己所想買的東西，他便用盡話句責駡我。我眞奇怪，爲什麽他變成這樣了？我流淚风背着他痛苦。</p>
<p>總之，我希望能夠找着一個適當的職業。</p>
<p>九月三十日</p>
<p>今天他居然跑開了，離開我跑到我不知道的地方去了。我無論如何也不能睡着，我的心啊，淒凉的心，破碎的心，啊，絞痛！</p>
<p>他說；「除了變愛之外，還有比戀愛更重要的東西存在。」那末這重要的東西是什麽呀？是主會事業？是革命？還是重新投到另一個女人的懷裏去呢？</p>
<p>對了，從前當他醉心戀愛的時候，他將其他一切完全擯棄，他認定一切妨碍戀愛，而現在，瘋狂的時代過去了，於是戀愛便妨碍一切了。</p>
<p>啊！嗎呀！我此刻眞需要你來安慰我啊！</p>
<p>他現在離開我了，當然他决不會體念到我此刻難堪的心緒。</p>
<p>好的，一切都過去了，現在我應當開始做我所要做的事了。但願我永遠不會聽到那可愛的孩子的哭聲。</p>
<p>我此刻支持不住了，我要倒在床上。病也好。死也好，我自不能動顫，同時誰也不來顧及我，而且，我又何須　們顧及呢？</p>
<p>一切都完了，就連那可愛的小孩也在其内。</p>
<p>「死就死，否則就得前進！」</p>
<p>唉！</p>
<h3>雙十節日記</h3>
<p>— ·一·萍</p>
<p>今天又是國慶，但是一切的景像和九一八國難相去幾何！政府下令禁止慶祝，一國的國慶日，而至於禁止慶祝，我們小百姓哭好呢還是笑好？我們的一羣每天愁着麫包問題尙且不遑，國家事亦不過偶然，想起先烈造成民國不容易，在外侮内爭的時候，發一兩聲不平的浩嘆罷了！</p>
<p>踐老友的約，跳上電車，仍擠滿了人羣，問或見幾面國旗，都含羞的在空中飄蕩，而遊戲塲及影響院却黑壓壓的人頭提但娱樂救國哩！</p>
<p>見了老友的面，就被他拉出來，跑上酒樓，老友是個愛國志士，一二八他曾到前線去的，後來慘敗下來，幾乎想自殺，他的情感很重，今天大槪特地約了我去一發牢騷吧，在酒樓上我見他狂飲，我不知如何勸慰他好，</p>
<p>中國竟像我們一樣不可救藥嗎？」終於他併出了這一句話，</p>
<p>「說來也慚愧」他接着說「我們曾替國家幹了些什麽！在學校時代還在每個紀念日，紅着臉喊幾句標語口號，現在呢？」他好像問着自己，</p>
<p>「民衆的心到底還没有冷」他重反轉來說，「就說一二八吧，民衆對於十九路的愛戴，　　　義勇軍跑到前線去，但是爲什麽國難不許紀念，國慶不許慶祝呢？啊！要是民衆的心冷了呢？」他舉了空的酒杯，望着屋頂，没有說出下文來，然而他的眼精已在發亮，</p>
<p>我差不多呆了，因爲我没有見過他像今天發狂的樣子。幸而酒樓裏没有人，我無可奈何祇硬把他拖下泍樓，</p>
<p>「朋友，爲什麽不許我喝酒，我從來没有像今天的傷心······」</p>
<p>「老友，你醉了，我扶你回去，」</p>
<p>「誰說我醉！」他張着怕人的眼精，</p>
<p>從他家裏歸來，已是晚飯時分，望見檯上一大堆的報紙，我没有看牠，就把牠放在舊紙堆上面，</p>
<p>國慶和我的年齡一樣的過去，同樣没有一些强差人意的事，我再像每年的希望！希望明年振作起來，熱烈的慶祝我們的國慶，</p>
<p>生活鞭子</p>
<h3>黃狗呌</h3>
<p>— ·小·剛</p>
<p>是一個長日永晝的夏午。</p>
<p>張公館裏一頓豐富的普能魚肉飯剛剛用罷，二少爺已接過老媽子絞來的熱燙手巾，抹過油膩嘴臉坐在和尙椅上了。這是老例：二少爺在大便，飯後一定要吹烟，現在他也伸手到短衫袋子裏摸出一個玲瓏扁盒來，就從那裏面抽出枝烟捲兒！自然要火來點一點哪，但這一點小事情，無用二少爺自己費力的，好久守在旁邊正想尋點什魔差替二少爺當當差以獻殷勤的王大，已給劃火來咧，　　「怪香！茄力克？」</p>
<p>歡喜喝酒再歡喜吹吹烟的王大在下風呑着一股烟味亂贊起來。可是他的嘴巴一動，給二少爺發見使人討厭的滿嘴嘴角瘡來了。</p>
<p>「唔！你到茅坑裏去偷過糞汚吃麽？」</p>
<p>但二少爺並不眞討厭在殷勤自己的王大，而且，他聽到那偷過糞汚吃的嘴巴裏說出來的高尙烟品：茄力克，心中倒有三分高興咧|所以雖然銜的是小美麗，雖然看見討厭的嘴角瘡，也笑容可掬地「唔||」着了。</p>
<p>王大看見二少爺面有笑影，以爲開口機會到了，於是便請二少爺帮忙：</p>
<p>「今天帮我對塲牌，二少爺！」</p>
<p>張公館裏原來天天有牌聲，不是新奶奶在對，便是二少爺在打。人多時，兩桌也常常有。二少爺的對牌興趣眞好呢。現在王大請帮忙，在二少爺，固然興之所至啦，但立刻就答應，似乎有失少爺身分。於是他忽然蹴蹴臥在脚旁拖出舌頭在喘的黃狗這樣說道：</p>
<p>「天這樣熱，有誰高興呢？」二少爺彷彿不高興。</p>
<p>「陳大爺是總要來玩的：戴大少，陸先生我已請好他們了，」王大像眞有些急模樣，</p>
<p>說着曹操就到。陳大爺，戴大少一輩子都趕到張公館來咧，　　主客招呼一陣後，王大就爲一個大洋頭錢的驅使，擺檯子，縛檯單的趕忙起來，</p>
<p>「陳大爺來不是對牌的嗎，」</p>
<p>二少爺曉得陳大爺也有個脾氣：便是恰巧祇有四個人時他一定是做做不是高興對牌來的表示。果然，陳大爺聽了二少爺的一句話，昨在籐榻上無意起來對牌了。</p>
<p>「王大！你要請陳林爺對牌，一定要對他磕三個頭求拜的。」</p>
<p>旁邊人指示王大一條路。王大於是堆着一隻哭笑不出的臉，請陳大爺起來對牌。</p>
<p>「呌三聲黃狗呌|給你對牌：」陳大爺同　時站起身來告訴大家說王大會黃狗呌的。</p>
<p>「好！呌三聲黃狗呌吧！我贊成！」二少爺也從和尙椅上躍起來，又顯出高興來了。</p>
<p>「黃狗呌啦！呌了對啦！」</p>
<p>旁邊人敎王大這樣應付，同時也想聽聽人狗呌。</p>
<p>王大曉得爺們在尋自己開心，可曉得回答說不會狗呌是殺爺們的風景的。於是他就兩手捧着一嘴嘴角瘡「嘮嘮嘮」像狗呌不像狗呌地說：「不會的。」</p>
<p>然而，爺們彷彿聽到黃狗呌聲大家自己坐到桌上去摸牌了。</p>

<h3>Lifeline? Or... A Mystery</h3>
<p>The Northeast Three Provinces were forcibly occupied due to non-resistance, causing our fertile Northeast to fall under the rule of foreign races. The 30 million people have tasted the pain of national subjugation. Furthermore, after forcefully seizing and plundering, the Japanese fabricated alarming statements to incite their domestic population. They also used deceptive words to confuse international public opinion. The Japanese said, "Manchuria is Japan's lifeline." The meaning of this interpretation is that it is their first line of national defense. Without possessing "Manchuria," the security of Korea cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p>If the security of Korea is not guaranteed, then the mainland of Japan itself will be in danger. Secondly, the Soviet Union is eyeing them covetously. The first Five-Year Plan focused entirely on the construction of everything within Soviet Russia. The second Five-Year Plan, in addition to advancing along the path of socialism, will further exert efforts to develop Siberia and North Manchuria. If Jilin and Heilongjiang are surrounded by "red atmosphere," then not only will the Japanese interests in "South Manchuria" be unsecured, but Korea will also no longer belong to Japan. Thirdly, Japan's investment in China exceeds 2.5 billion Japanese yen, and nearly 2 billion yen has been invested in the "South Manchuria" area. In recent years, the national consciousness of our country has gradually become widespread. Although the development of the Northeast is relatively late, the self-awareness of national independence is not significantly different from that of the advanced southeastern provinces. Small and medium-sized industries generally have the momentum to rise up and compete with Japan. Therefore, the Japanese were alarmed and used military force to transform economic competition into political aggression. They also knew that they might not be able to completely deceive the eyes and ears of the world. Therefore, they proclaimed within their own country, "Manchuria is Japan's lifeline." In reality, the development of the three northeastern provinces was only stimulated by Japan and Russia. Those who toiled day and night, braving wind and snow, and hacking through thorns, to engage in the development of the three northeastern provinces, were the immigrants from our Hebei and Shandong provinces, who contributed the most and received the least. Observing it from the most objective perspective (and many Japanese also say so), the climate in the Northeast is too cold, and the general living standards are too low, making it unsuitable for Japanese agricultural immigrants. Consider that in the nearly 25 years since Japan managed the South Manchuria Railway, they have used all kinds of methods to encourage Japanese "immigration," providing Japanese "immigrants" with enormous conveniences in all aspects of life and business operation. However, the number of Japanese residing within the territory of the three northeastern provinces, including those belonging to the Kwantung Leased Territory, is only 101,000. Along the South Manchuria Railway and its other branch lines, the Japanese "immigrants" directly under the jurisdiction of Japanese consulates number only 90,300. Adding various vagrant Japanese and those not registered with the Japanese consulates, the total maximum is no more than 200,000 people. With a population of 200,000, they actually dispatched an army of 100,000 to protect them. Is this what is meant by a "lifeline"? And after this great disturbance, Japan mobilized its troops to seize our land (although our country claims to be preserving its strength, the actual losses of land and mineral deposits are no less than one million yuan). However, counting their "immigrants," from last September to this September, there are only 500 households, and the armed force is only 420-30 adults. Is this what is meant by a "lifeline"?</p>
<p>Apart from a very few traitors, we Chinese, though daily under the iron heel of imperialist troops, and intimidated by their violence, can only swallow our tears and blood into our stomachs, wanting to cry but not daring to make a sound, and unable to call for help. However, righteous armies rise up one after another, willing to use their flesh and blood to compete with steel. Their actions may inevitably be clumsy, but their spirit is worthy of all ages. Moreover, Japan thinks it is riding high, having a number of traitors at its disposal to command. However, those who correct disorder and return to righteousness, willing to fight for national glory, follow Ma Zhanshan, succeeded by Su Bingwen and Zhang Dianjiu, causing Japan's monetary bribes to completely lose their effectiveness. The last bit of vitality of our Chinese nation in the three northeastern provinces still exists. At present, the temporary victories and defeats are not easy to determine. Even if the isolated troops in remote areas cannot sustain themselves due to lack of supplies and ammunition, the seeds of national struggle have been sown in the "hearts" of the 30 million Chinese in the Northeast. After some time, they will inevitably erupt together. The movement for national restoration may not be far off. Since Japan started the September 18th Incident last year, the losses of general industry and commerce are not mentioned for now, but just the military expenses of the army and navy up to September this year have actually exceeded 340 million Japanese yen. The budget for next year, just for the army, will definitely be over 200 million yen. What will they gain in the end? It will only further incite our national resistance and increase the jealousy of other countries.</p>
<p>In addition, the United States of America has already publicly announced its non-recognition doctrine. Although it has no major direct impact on Japan's occupation of the Northeast, this kind of explicit "denial" prevents Japan from being vigilant due to fear and increases its navy on a large scale to prepare for the sudden arrival of an emergency. At the same time, the Soviet Union, lurking in the icy and snowy land, is currently competing in its internal construction, only adopting a keen observation of the situation externally. However, its well-organized military preparations and sharpening of weapons are already known to the world. Now that Japan has seized the three northeastern provinces, the chances of direct conflict have increased. (At present, the fishery agreement and petroleum agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union are all based on short-term combination of interests, and since China and the Soviet Union have not resumed diplomatic relations, the Soviet Union has to adopt an effective diplomatic strategy towards Japan, so this kind of understanding will only be temporary.) Since the chances of conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union have increased, Japan's precautions in the Northeast must be more severe. This means that Japan's navy and army are always in a position to be attacked from both sides. In addition, the farmers are suffering in the fields (rice prices are falling), the workers are suffering in the cities (wages are being reduced), and the merchants are suffering from business recession (prices are soaring). How can it annex China, invade the Soviet Union, and fight the United States in the East? The aggressive mentality of the Japanese warlords is not only to dominate "Manchuria," but also to have the momentum to invade North China and transport their military power to the Yangtze River basin. If Britain is in this situation, it may not be suspicious and separate from Japan. Then, the position of Japan in the international community and in East Asia in the future will be the position of Germany before the war. If it provokes a ring attack from various countries, will it verify Yasuya Uchida's words that "the whole country will be turned into scorched earth"? Is the so-called "lifeline" really a lifeline or a "life-destroying line"?</p>

<p>Jinan, 10 PM tonight, Shahe telegram: (1) From last night to this morning, Liu's army in the city continued to bombard the north of the city with artillery. (2) Li Yue and Li Henghua met twice at Shentang this afternoon. Fan Yuhuang did not go due to physical discomfort. Li Henghua talked, and after returning to the city to visit Liu Zhennian, Liu expressed complete obedience to the central government and cessation of military operations. Li Yue immediately questioned why the city was still bombarding outwards with artillery fire last night. Li Henghua said that it was still under investigation as to which party fired the artillery. In the midst of the conversation, a loud boom was heard, and a shell flew out of the city, exploding near the place where the two Lis were talking. Li Henghua then blushed and was speechless, expressing that he would immediately order his subordinates upon returning to the city to strictly prohibit bombardment. The matter of inspecting the city was considered unnecessary by all and was terminated. It is reported that Li Yue and Fan Yuhuang will transfer from Shahe to Laiyang within the next few days. It is also heard that Li and Fan brought three conditions raised by a certain important person to negotiate with Liu. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, representatives of public groups from Yexian, Zhao Baoshan, etc., telegraphed to the capital, stating that the innocent people of Yexian were surrounded by a large army, and constantly attacked by field artillery and mortars. Three to four thousand people have been killed or injured in the city, and over two thousand five hundred houses have been destroyed. Corpses lie everywhere, a tragic sight. They earnestly appeal to all parties to call for a ceasefire as a united front to save the lives of the people. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Beiping, a certain agency received a telegram stating that Li Yue met with Liu's representative, Li Henghua, at Shilipu, Yexian, on the 11th. Liu's side proposed that the Korean army must first withdraw to the original defense in Weixian before discussing other issues. Liu is determined to obey the central government's orders. The meeting between the two sides produced no results. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Jinan Shahe letter: When Li Yue and others first arrived, they sent someone with a letter into Yexian to meet Liu Zhennian. Liu's army fired shots, and only when a white flag was shown did they stop. After a strict search, they were blindfolded with cloth and led into the city. Liu sent a local to accompany them with a reply letter. They removed the cloth only after leaving Liu's army defense line. Liu's letter welcomed Li and others to enter the city, and sent a car to Wulipuzi or Fanjia to greet them. When inquiring the local about the situation in the city, he only shook his head and sighed, saying that it was terrible, and dared not say anything else. Li Yue is also planning to go to Laiyang and Yantai for inspection. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, news from a certain source, the highest military leader of the central government's disposal method for the conflict between the Korean and Liu armies is to advocate that both sides' troops immediately withdraw to their original defenses, cease hostile actions, and then discuss the root causes of the conflict between the two sides. If necessary, Liu's army can also be transferred to other defense locations. At present, Liu's expression is that he will obey the central government in everything. The Korean army's goal is for Liu's army to stop hostile actions first. Therefore, the crux of the matter at present is whether both sides sincerely accept the central government's orders. If each is insincere and disobeys, then even if the military and political department's committee mediates, it is still difficult to determine whether this crux can be resolved. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Jinan, six representatives from the Laiyang Party Committee and gentry and merchants, representing the people of the entire county, met Li Yue and Fan Yuhuang in Shahe, requesting the central government to uphold the principle of settling matters peacefully and resolving the Shandong affair peacefully. According to the discussion, there are a total of six regiments of Liu's army in Laiyang. In addition to Liang Lizhu's brigade of three regiments, there are also a cavalry, a training, and a special affairs regiment. He Yisan lives in the county government, presides over everything, and actively repairs defense works. Gun holes are dug around the city, and soldiers move in underground tunnels. Office work is also done in underground tunnels. No one is seen on the streets, and they leave the city through underground tunnels. The current first line of defense is at Mashanpu, west of the city, defending based on the mountains, about 20 li from the city. Food and livestock have been looted to prepare for a long-term resistance, but it is dependent on Yexian. The current defense lines of the two armies are 20-30 li apart. The county head and the chief of the public security bureau have set up an administrative office at Shuigoutou, 50 li southwest of the city. The representatives denied the report in the Dagongbao on the 6th that the representatives of all sectors in Laiyang sent a telegram. Li and Fan went to Shilipu at 10 AM on the 12th to wait for the representative, Li Henghua. At noon, Henghua was led out of the city by a local. The provincial army</p>
<p>first sent people to protect him within the defense line. After meeting, because the houses in Shilipu were inconvenient, they changed to Shentang for the meeting, and had a secret talk for an hour. Henghua was still sent out of the defense line and back to the city by people from the provincial army. Li and Fan also returned to Shahe. Li Yue said that the contact was extremely satisfactory and that he could guarantee that there would be no more shooting in the future, and that military action would be stopped absolutely, awaiting the central government's resolution. Whether to enter the city or not will be decided after Henghua asks Liu for instructions. It is scheduled to meet again on the 12th. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

They are now attacking Yingpeng Guangyue. Gong Fusong and Ji Hui are all preparing for armed suppression. It is also telegraphed that the Sichuan affair is caused by ambitious warlords seeking to expand their personal desires, with the intention of encompassing the overall situation, using provocation as a skill. Recently, they have extorted money from the people, inciting public anger. Last year, they oppressed our army and invaded Huayang, Jianyang, Anue, Lezhi, Suining, Hanbei, Pengxi, and Shunqing counties in violation of central government orders. Their violence and arrogance are equal to those of the Japanese pirates against us this time.</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>They have attacked Luo's division again. Colleagues are filled with righteous indignation and have risen up to prevent it with armed force. It is truly as Jing Gong said, seeking a thorough solution, so that the Sichuan situation can be stabilized, and we can work together to save the country, secure internal affairs, and resist foreign aggression.

Unexpectedly, news of the emergency in Wusheng came, and Liu Wenhui's troops stationed in Suining, Tongnan, Anue, and Lezhi advanced one after another, with a strong momentum to approach Peng'an, Yingshan, Guang'an, and Yuechi. If war breaks out, the crime of misleading the country and Sichuan will be countless. I, Jiayu, feel the danger and cannot remain silent. I urge our government to immediately issue strict orders to investigate and deal with the culprits. Our military committee sternly reiterated military orders.

<h3>Key Points of the Petition by Representatives of the People of Xikang in Beijing</h3>
<p>Due to the Tibetan invasion of Kang, which has not been suppressed for a long time, and taking advantage of the Sichuan affairs disputes, the people of Xikang are preparing a major counter-offensive. A large number of representatives have been appointed to form a petition delegation. Fifteen people, including Nuona Ma Zechun, have arrived in Beijing to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and various departments, committees, and ministries. The most urgent matters are: (1) The Central Government should be responsible for stopping the Sichuan war; (2) The Central Government should resolve to recover lost territory; (3) Provide relief funds to the volunteer army so that the national defense forces are not constrained by internal strife and can be withdrawn to the mountains. The next most urgent matters are: (1) Organize a people's self-defense army; (2) Determine the boundaries of Kang and Tibet; (3) Quickly establish the provincial government of Xikang; (4) Assign Ningyuan and other counties to Xikang; (5) Improve Xikang's transportation; (6) Establish Mongolian and Tibetan schools in Xikang quickly; (7) Immigrate and colonize the border areas to promote social prosperity. According to a representative, the main goal of the Tibetan army's invasion is to seize the boundaries of Qingkang, separate from Chinese territory, and establish a false Tibetan state. The flags used by the Tibetan army in combat with the national army are a lion image, not the national emblem of the Republic of China, which reveals their intentions. The Tibetan side clearly has a background and is using a strategy of dividing China, instigating the Dalai Lama to declare independence. However, they are not yet fully prepared. The government should pay close attention and use military and political force to curb their conspiracy and force them to submit, striving for a thorough solution without concessions that would leave future troubles.

<h3>Xie Jieshi Goes to Japan</h3>
<p>Xie Jieshi and seventeen other members departed from Changchun this morning by train to Tokyo. Zheng Xiaoxu, Zhang Jinghui, and others went to the station to see them off. Xie and his group are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo next Monday to meet with the Japanese Emperor and present Puyi's letter of recognition. They will then meet with Japanese Prime Minister Saito, Foreign Minister Uchida, Army Minister Araki, and Honjo to exchange views on the "Manchukuo" and attempt to conclude a commercial treaty with Japan and abolish the "Manchukuo's" consular jurisdiction. Regarding the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia, they will exchange views with Uchida, as Russia requires the establishment of such a treaty with Japan before agreeing to sign one with Manchukuo. It is currently believed in Manchukuo and Japanese circles that Xie will explain to the Japanese Foreign Minister that it is now appropriate for Japan, Russia, and Manchukuo to conclude a non-aggression treaty to promote peace in the Far East.

<p>The Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Sangashima, has protested to the municipal government on the 12th about the voluntary sealing of over 9,000 yuan worth of Japanese goods by ten department and thread stores, including Renchang, which had requested the National Salvation Association of Merchants to send personnel to supervise their storage. The consul claims that the stores had done so under duress by the National Salvation Association. The municipal government immediately sent personnel to investigate secretly and confirmed that the merchants had done so voluntarily and that the National Salvation Association was not involved. The government is scheduled to reject the protest on the 13th. (12th Special Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Huang Musong Talks About the Future of Disarmament</h3>
<p>Huang Musong in Nanjing stated that the contents of China's proposal at this disarmament conference can be divided into three points: (1) spiritual restrictions, (2) qualitative restrictions, and (3) quantitative restrictions. Most countries have expressed sympathy for this, but according to China's actual situation, it is still insufficient for self-defense and naturally has no restrictions. Although all countries in the world have no objections to disarmament, the path to peace is still far away, and the people of the country must deeply reflect on themselves in order to survive. This time, Japan's atrocities in our country have destroyed peace in the Far East. Public opinion in various countries has mostly expressed dissatisfaction with Japan. Although there is a League of Nations mechanism to uphold justice, the manifestation of strength depends entirely on us, and we must never rely solely on it. (12th Special Telegraph)</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Increases Troops on Border</h3>
<p>Comintern Directives:</p>
<p>Consolidate the Strength of the Chinese Red Army</p>
<p>Encourage Intensified Anti-Japanese Work</p>
<p>▲The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported that the Soviet Union has suddenly ordered a large number of Red Army soldiers to be sent to the Siberian border, while informing Japan that it is to maintain local order and does not interfere with Japan's actions.</p>
<p>▲A telegram from the National News Agency in Moscow on the 12th disclosed for the first time that at the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party in September, a directive was passed and forwarded by the Third International to the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party to consolidate the strength of the Red Army and intensify anti-Japanese activities in Manchuria. The disclosure of this order has attracted great attention here, especially since news from Tokyo and Changchun indicates that Japan and Russia are about to reach a compromise and become friendly, and this order serves as a counter-evidence.</p>
<h3>Japanese Traitors Exert All Efforts to Appease the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>False Diplomatic Center Moves to Tokyo</p>
<p>▲A telegram from Hualianshe in Tokyo on the 12th reports that Japanese Army Minister Araki held a secret talk with Soviet Ambassador to Japan Troyanovsky at some place a few days ago and discussed Russian-Japanese issues. Both parties kept the content secret. Bao Guanjong also held secret talks with the Russian ambassador, and the false Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Oohashi Chikai arrived in Tokyo today. His mission is also to appease Russia as a tool to deal with the League of Nations. It is reported that Xie Jieshi, the false Foreign Minister, and Feng Hanqing, the false Minister of Justice, will also arrive in the capital within days. The false diplomatic center has moved to the capital.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Council Meeting</h3>
<p>Decides on New Policies Towards Russia and Manchuria</p>
<p>▲A telegram from Hualianshe in Tokyo on the 12th reports that the Japanese military held two important confidential meetings today. At the first meeting, Army Minister Araki, Vice Minister Yanagawa, Army Affairs Director Yamaoka, General Staff Officer Masaki, General Affairs Director Umezu, and First Department Director Furusho attended to discuss the following issues: (1) basic issues of the Manchurian policy, (2) deployment of the Kwantung Army, (3) total attack on the volunteer army, and (4) policy towards Russia. They also discussed the four aspects of the current Manchurian policy: the conquest of Jehol, the independence of Manchuria, methods of suppressing the anti-Japanese and anti-puppet movements in the entire Northeast, and policies for dealing with Russia in the operation in Manchuria. The discussion lasted a long time. It is reported that the military has decided on its strategy. Afterwards, a military council meeting will be held, and it is scheduled that a certain director will be dispatched to the Northeast with instructions within days. ▲A telegram from Hualianshe in Tokyo on the 12th reports that a temporary military council meeting was held at the Ministry of the Army at 2:00 PM today. Araki reported on the countermeasures against the report by Li Ton, the situation of Manchuria's independence, the anti-Japanese and anti-puppet movements of the Northeast volunteer army, and the military's countermeasures, as well as the attitudes of various countries towards Japan and the issue of the Russian-Japanese-Manchurian non-aggression treaty. The military councilors all expressed their approval of the government's countermeasures. However, regarding the issue of the Russian-Japanese-Manchurian non-aggression treaty, according to the military, the final attitude can only be determined after Xie Jieshi arrives in the capital. However, Japan's friendliness towards Russia is merely a pretext for restraining the League of Nations, or perhaps merely a scare tactic.</p>
<h3>Japan Adopts a Proactive Approach to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>▲A dispatch from Dentsu in Tokyo on the 12th reports that as a result of recent consultations between Foreign Minister Uchida and the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it became clear that even if a reservation is attached to the League of Nations General Assembly, expressing a passive opposition intention, it will have no practical effect. It is better to vote against it openly at the time of the General Assembly vote, indicating the attention of the Japanese government, which is more appropriate. The heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs fully agreed with this and decided that Ambassador to France Nagaoka, Ambassador to Belgium Sato, and Matsuoka Yosuke will be formally appointed as Japanese representatives, and formally recognize the temporary General Assembly and openly participate in the discussion. Foreign Minister Uchida's transformation to such proactive diplomacy towards the League of Nations is noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Communist Party Plans Nationwide Uprising</h3>
<p>Police Department Conducts Extensive Raids for Days</p>
<p>Many Members of the Bourgeoisie Implicated</p>
<p>▲ China United Press, Tokyo, 12th – According to a statement by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, the robbery of the Omori Daihyaku Bank branch at 3:50 PM on the 8th was an act of the Communist Party. The purpose was to raise military funds for a nationwide uprising. Matsuzaka Hisahira confessed that a certain major industrialist and a certain banker were secretly donating funds to the Communist Party. The Metropolitan Police Department is extremely alarmed. At 5:00 AM this morning, they surrounded five important institutions in the city and arrested a large number of Communist Party members. The first group surrounded the residence of a certain Kosaka in Oi-machi, Shinagawa Ward, seizing eighteen pistols and 5,000 rounds of ammunition. The second group surrounded the fifth floor of the Tedi house near Shinbashi Station, discovering automobile license plate number 15,278. The third group surrounded No. 332 Nishi-Sugamo, Sugamo Ward, capturing Ito Asao. The fourth and fifth groups of police officers only arrested one male party member and three female party members. It is rumored that the Communist Party has established a separate headquarters for purchasing military equipment, with Ito in charge. They planned to launch a nationwide uprising on the 15th anniversary of the Russian Revolution, but the plan was thwarted before it could be carried out. Furthermore, the accountant of the robbed Omori Daihyaku Bank was also a key member of the Communist Party and assisted in the robbery. A certain major bank is also expected to be searched within the next few days. Because this plan involves many members of the bourgeoisie, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department feels particularly powerless. It is said to be the largest plan of its kind ever seen in Japan.</p>
<h3>Japan's Attitude Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Therefore, China's Boycott of Japanese Goods Will Continue Unabated</p>
<p>Dr. Yang Answers Questions from Londoners</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 11th – Dr. Yang Guang-sheng, the Chinese Consul-General in London, gave a speech at the London Friendship Hall today, titled "China and the New World." After the speech, Dr. Yang invited the audience to ask questions freely. When asked what events would occur if the League of Nations could not get Japan to accept the Lytton Report, Dr. Yang slowly replied that if that were the case, animosity towards Japan would deepen, and the boycott would intensify, not only in commerce but also in social interaction. The situation would worsen, perhaps inevitably leading to conflict between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Internal Warfare Continues</h3>
<p>Giving Japan Propaganda Material Against America</p>
<p>Debuchi to Return to America Before Christmas to Assume Office</p>
<p>▲ Kuo Min News Agency, Approximately from New York, 11th – Japanese Acting Ambassador Saito delivered a speech at Columbia University tonight, defending Japan's invasion of Manchuria, and claiming that if China remains politically disorganized and continues its internal strife, the word "prosperity" will completely disappear from China.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 12th – According to reliable sources today, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, recently requested leave to return to his country and plans to return to his post before Christmas. It is rumored that the authorities asked Yoshida, the current ambassador to Italy who is currently in the country, to replace Debuchi as ambassador to the United States, but he declined.</p>
<h3>Hungary Voices Support for Germany, Demands Equality in Armaments</h3>

<h3>German Chancellor Visits Bavaria to Promote Internal Unity</h3>
<p>Federal Government Accused in Trial Opens for Second Time</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Munich, 11th – Chancellor von Papen has arrived here and will discuss constitutional reform plans with the Bavarian authorities. Both von Papen and Bavarian State Premier Held said that Germany must first seek internal unity in order to achieve its diplomatic goals.</p>
<p>▲ Kuo Min News Agency, Leipzig, 11th – The trial of Prussia and the Central Church Party against the Federal Government opened for the second time today. The focus is on whether the Federal Government's actions on that day were the result of an understanding with the National Socialist Party. Federal Government representative Dr. Goetzimo, on behalf of Chancellor von Papen, emphatically declared that there was no understanding, stating that Prussian Interior Minister Severing had even met with Federal Interior Minister Gayl before July 20 to urge the appointment of a Prussian High Commissioner. To save time, the court did not want to hear testimony from those involved in the disputed points and asked Severing and Gayl to explain everything in writing. However, the two men's accounts of the conversation differed greatly. Gayl insisted that Severing strongly advocated for the early appointment of a High Commissioner, while Severing claimed that he never mentioned it or even thought about it. The hearing continued in the afternoon, debating Article 48 of the constitution. Many of the country's most renowned law professors were in attendance.</p>
<h3>German Restoration Conspiracy</h3>
<p>German Newspapers Speak with Certainty</p>
<p>Government Vigorously Denies Its Absurdity</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 10th – The Berliner Volks-Zeitung carried a bizarre story today, claiming that the government has a conspiracy to restore the monarchy. The former Crown Prince, known as Little Wilhelm during the European War, recently told his friends that he and three of Germany's most powerful figures have jointly formulated a policy. The three so-called key figures are German President Hindenburg, Chancellor von Papen, and Defense Minister Schleicher. According to the planned, Hindenburg will resign at an appropriate time, and the former Crown Prince will be appointed regent. At that time, the Bavarian army and 400,000 Stahlhelm members will support the former Crown Prince. The initiators of this plan are determined to fight if necessary. Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria has approved the plan, with the condition that he must be the head of a certain Danube country on the day the former Crown Prince is appointed regent. The German government dismissed the above news as pure speculation.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Expels Large Number of Party Members</h3>
<p>For Participating in Right-Wing Activities</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Moscow, 11th – According to TASS news agency, the Central Control Commission of the Soviet Communist Party issued an order on October 9 expelling twenty-four party members. These people had participated in counter-revolutionary activities, secretly establishing organizations of property owners to restore capitalism in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>▲ Kuo Min News Agency, Berlin, 12th – The expulsion of twenty-four prominent figures from the Soviet Communist Party coincided with the completion of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the largest in the world.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The Soviet Russian Communist Party celebrated it as a milestone in the development of socialism, but Berlin newspapers saw it as evidence of the increasing struggle between Stalin and the right-wing opposition and the many difficulties ahead. The so-called right-wing opposition does not approve of the party's current path, advocating for a major policy change, moving towards democracy, and opening the chains that prohibit all privately run businesses. This faction's advocacy fully represents the demands and aspirations of the general peasantry, and its power is not to be underestimated. Therefore, German newspapers have commented on these two major events, believing that the expulsion of twenty-four people is just one scene in the secret struggle between Stalin and the opposition. As the Vossische Zeitung stated, Stalin is facing a serious crisis, and when he suddenly takes an offensive stance, he is certainly deeply aware of this situation. Without a doubt, the Berliner Lokalanzeiger claimed that the economic elements that make up the opposition will continue to operate in secret, and hinted that major events are about to occur in the Soviet Union. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung said that there is an important part of the Soviet Russian Communist Party that wants to remove Stalin from power.</p>
<h3>French Parliament to Convene at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 11th – This afternoon, the cabinet met at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with Premier and Foreign Minister Herriot presiding.

When asked about his trip to London, Herriot said that his trip was only to consult with the British perspective and did not involve any decisions. He expects to return to Paris around Saturday.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Workers Riot in Northern Ireland</h3>
<p>Reuters, Belfast, 11th – There was a serious riot by unemployed workers in Belfast, Northern Ireland, today. More than 2,000 police officers, assisted by armored vehicles, are patrolling the streets. Before dawn, all people were prohibited from entering the city, and police checkpoints were densely deployed on the outskirts to monitor pedestrians.</p>
<p>Reuters, Belfast, 12th – In the riot here, three people died and twenty-five were injured. The police court convened an unusual midnight session, detaining forty rioters. Rioting and looting occurred throughout yesterday, as the unemployed were dissatisfied with the wages paid under the special relief plan. Because the authorities prohibited marches and demonstrations, the crowds threw stones at the police to vent their anger. The police later returned fire after someone opened fire, killing one bystander. Several people were wounded by bullets in the evening. Shops were looted, and streetcars were attacked, injuring drivers. The police repeatedly dispersed the crowds, but only briefly. The crowds included women, who bravely threw stones and glass bottles at the police. The police were outnumbered and in a precarious situation. Fortunately, armored vehicles arrived, forcing the riots into side streets and a standoff. The crowds shouted, "We want bread!"</p>

<h3>En Route to Central Europe · Gong · Zhen</h3>
<p>The September 18th Incident on the Ganji Ship</p>
<p>The Northeast has been lost for nearly a year. Today, compatriots at home will express their firm and painful remembrance of this September 18th incident everywhere. Generally, the farther people are from their motherland, the more ardent their love for their motherland. Seeing the strength of other countries, their hopes for their own country also increase. We are very concerned about the domestic situation, but unfortunately, only the wireless telegraphs sent daily by the Italian National News Agency (Agenzia Radis Nazionale) are available on the ship, and they mainly report European affairs. Even when there are mentions of China, the details are often vague, which is extremely depressing.</p>
<p>There are more than 40 Chinese passengers on the "Ganji" ship. All of them said that since the September 18th incident was approaching, there should be a simple memorial service. Therefore, it was decided to hold it early with the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar. As there were more people in the economy class, it was decided to gather in the restaurant of that class. After introducing each other, Wen Yuanmo, director of the Physics Department of Beijing Normal University, was elected chairman. His speech stated that from the 18th of September of last year, when Japan launched an unprovoked attack on our country, to today, it has been almost a year minus four days. In this year, our country lost three provinces of land and 30 million compatriots in the Northeast, and nearly 200 million in property and nearly 100,000 lives in the Southeast. Although this is due to our country's poor political governance, underdeveloped academics, and incomplete military preparations in peacetime, which resulted in decades of poverty and weakness, it is undeniable that our country failed to respond effectively after the outbreak of the national crisis, resulting in the loss of many opportunities diplomatically and militarily. Speaking only of diplomacy, for more than half a year from the September 18th incident of last year to March and April of this year, there were no ministers stationed in many important countries. Those who were there were unknown to the Chinese or foreigners. We were unable to resist internally and cut off aid from abroad. How could national affairs not deteriorate day by day? Minister Gu Wei-jun disregarded the danger to accompany the investigation team to the Northeast, and is now leading a mission to France to attend the League of Nations General Assembly. I deeply hope that he will use his rich talents and experience to reverse all the previous failures. I also want to hear clearly about how we should strive in the future. Then, Minister Gu Wei-jun, the envoy to France, gave a speech, saying that everyone present is excellent, and some have been serving society for many years and are still not satisfied, so they are going to Europe for further study, which is admirable. Today, there is such a gathering on a ship in a third country, and I think everyone has endless feelings. Looking back, when can the Northeast be recovered? The future is very bleak. What is past cannot be undone, but what is to come can be pursued. I only hope that we will not take the wrong path in the future and not miss any opportunities. I am also a member of the students studying abroad, and now I would like to briefly describe my thoughts on returning to the country for your reference. How could such a large Northeast be easily seized? Why are we helpless after it has been seized? People say that China is too poor and everything cannot be done without money, but our country has fertile land and rich resources, such as various mineral products that are envied by the world, and the people are hardworking and patient, which is also rare in the world, so it cannot be said to be poor. Others say that China's educational level is too low, and the upper class cannot lead by example. In fact, in the past 20 years, many universities and elementary schools have been added, so it cannot be said that there has been no progress compared to before. And many of the politicians are returned students, so the instability of the political situation is not the responsibility of those who have not been educated. Others say that China is bound by unequal treaties, which deprives it of all freedom. Such treaties should be amended, but looking at Dalian, which was a wasteland 30 years ago, and Hong Kong, which was an isolated island in the sea dozens of years ago, both are now flourishing and have become one of the leading commercial ports in the East, and eight or nine out of ten of their residents are Chinese. Furthermore, flourishing areas such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao are all operated by foreigners. Why can't we open up our own markets to show the spirit of development of our nation? This is nothing else but a lack of cooperation. Confucian and Mencian academics emphasize personal cultivation, so the teachings of "wise men protect themselves" and "those with different paths do not conspire with each other" are deeply ingrained in people's hearts, which is completely contrary to the current situation. The military and political policies of Europe and the United States follow public opinion. Sometimes when a problem arises, even if individuals with experience do not necessarily agree with the solution, they have to abandon their prejudices because the situation is extraordinary. Therefore, they would rather help from the side, and not only do they not take credit, but they often hold the mindset of "if I don't do it right, I will ruin it." After you go to Europe, I hope that on the one hand, you will study hard, and on the other hand, you will investigate the founding elements and national spirit of the countries where you are staying. Science is omnipotent, which is certainly true, but the Northeast Arsenal is the largest and newest in the country, and the Northeast also has all kinds of scientific equipment, such as radio stations, which are also very advanced. Why can't they protect our country? All of this should be considered carefully. Others say that China has vast land and abundant resources and a large population, so it will never perish. However, looking at the 30 million people in the Northeast who are now controlled by 60,000 to 70,000 Japanese soldiers, and Singapore, where we are passing through, which has a population of 400,000, of which Chinese account for eight-tenths, but the British, numbering only 5,000, manage it in an orderly manner, and Korea and India, which can also be said to have vast land, abundant resources, and large populations, are they in a good situation now? The existence of this dangerous state makes us anxious day and night. Leaders from all walks of life in the country often have too strong personalities and do not understand the importance of cooperation, resulting in mutually harmful outcomes. I hope that we can change our ways and work together with one heart and one mind within ten years, so that we can not only resist foreign aggression but also enable China to enjoy its due position in the international community. After the meeting, everyone went to the deck to take a photo as a souvenir.</p>
<p>On that day, in addition to university professors, students studying abroad, and representatives, there were also eight Yantai merchants who were going to the Netherlands to sell silkworm cocoons and silk. They also participated. Furthermore, the ship employed 14 Chinese people, six of whom were servants and eight who specialized in laundry. They also came to listen, saying that they would like to donate their remaining money to the Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>On September 18, when the ship was sailing between Colombo and Pambei, Chinese people agreed not to go to the music room, dance hall, and cinema to show that they would not forget the national humiliation. At 4:30 PM, another lecture was held in the economy class restaurant. Wen Pengjiu was elected chairman. Wang Dazhen, a specialist member of the delegation, spoke on "Japan's diplomatic strategy after the September 18th incident," and Qian Tai spoke on "Where does our way to avenge the humiliation after the September 18th incident lie?" Other issues were also discussed. (Night of September 18 on the coast of Pambei, India)</p>
<h3>Su Bingwen Suddenly Occupies the China Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Simultaneous Occupation of Stations, Swift Action</p>
<p>Most Organized Attack by the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Japanese and Traitorous Officials Detained On the Spot</p>
<p>Traffic on the Western Section of the China Eastern Railway Will Be Severed</p>
<p>From the North China Daily News, Harbin, September 30: Rumors of General Su Bingwen's Railway Protection Army preparing to resist Japan had been circulating for some time, so this sudden occupation of the China Eastern Railway stations west of Qiqihar was not unexpected. However, the speed of their actions was extraordinary, showing evidence of careful planning and excellent organization, so the stations were virtually occupied simultaneously. According to news from Manzhouli, the commander there pretended to host a banquet, inviting Japanese and "Manchukuo" (puppet) officials to a feast, and detained them all on the spot. Someone who came from Manzhouli recently confirmed this, saying that although there was fierce gunfire in the streets at the time, it was quickly quelled. Within one or two hours, the area was completely stable. Some Japanese were arrested, some were killed, and some fled into Russian territory. The Chinese army then issued a notice stating that they only wanted to expel the Japanese and traitors, urging the Chinese and Russian people to live in peace and not to be alarmed. The stations occupied by Su's troops have all removed the Soviet Russian and "Manchukuo" flags, and re-erected the Blue Sky White Sun flag. Railway traffic has not been disrupted yet. In the Northeast, the Volunteer Army has been carrying out irregular attacks on the railways, without a central command. This uprising on the western section of the China Eastern Railway is entirely under the command of Su Bingwen's army, with countless farmers joining the ranks to resist Japan together. Most of the area is outside the Xing'an Mountains and has no Japanese troops, so its situation can be said to be self-contained. If the Japanese army attacks in the future, the railway line will be cut off everywhere, similar to the eastern section of the China Eastern Railway, and the troops will not be able to pass through.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Goes to Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>Visits Nankou and the Ming Tombs</p>
<p>Expresses Deep Sympathy for the Northeast Volunteer Army</p>
<p>News from Beiping: Feng Yuxiang left Taian at 5:00 PM on the 7th and traveled north. At 3:45 AM on the 8th, he passed through Fengtai and transferred to the PingSui Railway to the north. When passing through Nankou, he visited the cemetery of the fallen soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army in the Battle of Nankou, and after visiting the Ming Tombs, he took a train from Nankou at 5:00 PM and arrived in Zhangjiakou the next morning. The details of Feng's visit to Zhangjiakou are as follows.</p>
<p>Special Train Passes Through Hebei: After receiving the news of Feng's trip north, Qin Decun, Chen Xiven, Zhao Yanqing, and more than ten others from Song Zheyuan's office in Beiping took a train to Fengtai to welcome him on the evening of the 7th. Feng's special train was scheduled to arrive at Fengtai at 12:00 that night, but it was delayed along the way, not arriving at Fengtai until 3:45 AM on the 8th. By then, Feng had already gone to bed. The welcoming party boarded the train one after another. At 4:10, the special train entered the PingSui Railway. At 4:55, it arrived at the Ximen Station. Wan Fulin, representing Zhang Xueliang, along with Tang Guozhen and several others, was waiting at the station to greet him. After the train stopped, Wan boarded the train and spoke with Feng for a long time. When the train was about to leave, Feng got off the train and said goodbye to Wan. Feng was still wearing the blue short cotton jacket and pants and black cloth shoes that he wore when he passed through Beiping last year. His face was fuller than before. Deng Zhexi introduced the reporters to Feng. After shaking hands with the reporters, Feng said that everyone was an old friend and that his itinerary was not yet determined. After speaking, Deng handed the reporters the speech he had written. Tang Guozhen brought a lot of iron-canned biscuits and fresh fruits sent by Zhang Xueliang to Feng. Feng immediately ordered them to be taken in. Besides Qin Decun and Chen Xiven, who accompanied Feng on the train north, the rest of the welcoming party returned to the city from Xizhimen. In addition to his wife, sons, and daughters, Deng Zhexi, Han Duofeng, Liu Shande, Yu Xinqing, Zhang Yunrong, and more than twenty others from Taian accompanied him. In addition, there was a company of guards to protect him.</p>
<p>Visiting the Ming Tombs: The special train left Xizhimen at 5:15 and arrived at Nankou at 7:00 AM. At that time, Feng was having breakfast in the train with his wife, Li Dequan, and his sons and daughters. Feng then walked out of the station with Chen Xiven, Qin Decun, Yu Xinqing, Liu Shande, Zhang Yunrong, and more than ten others to pay tribute at the cemetery of the fallen soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army in the Battle of Nankou. Qin Decun and Chen Xiven stood with Feng in front of the tomb and talked about the battle that day. For a moment, hundreds of local villagers gathered around the tomb to watch Feng's demeanor. Feng ordered Liu Shande to hire three sedan chairs and ten mules to visit the Ming Tombs. At that time, Feng and others walked out of the tomb fence and got into the sedan chairs in front of the Nankou Hotel. Feng, Chen Xiven, and Qin Decun each rode in a sedan chair. In addition, five attendants and five guards rode donkeys to follow. Before leaving, Feng also ordered his attendants to bring two shotguns from the train so that he could hunt along the way. They planned to return in six hours. The departure was at 10:00 AM, and they were scheduled to return to Nankou at 4:00 PM. Around 5:00 PM, they took the original train north and arrived in Zhangjiakou the next morning. According to Chen Xiven, Mr. Feng originally had several houses in Zhangjiakou, but he sold some of them. This time, in addition to inspecting the remaining houses, he also planned to stay there.</p>
<p>Feng's Speech: At 9:00 AM on the 8th, at the cemetery of the fallen soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army in the Battle of Nankou, the reporters asked to visit Mr. Feng and had the following conversation with Feng: (Reporter asked) Mr. Feng, you must be tired from your trip north. (Feng replied) It's not tiring. The country has come to this point, and there is no point in talking about tiring or not. You have followed the train to Nankou, and there has been no good hospitality along the way. I'm really sorry. Fortunately, there is plenty of tofu in Nankou Station. Please eat a few more bowls. People who have lived in Beiping for a long time cannot easily eat the common people's tofu. (Asked) What is the purpose of Mr. Feng's trip? (Answered) I have nothing to do this time I came to the north. When I get to Chahar, I don't want to stay long. I also want to go to Datong to see the Yungang Grottoes. The place to live permanently has not yet been determined. In today's China, where can we talk about a permanent place? It is still warm in the south, so I came to the north to cool off. Fortunately, my illness has recovered, and it doesn't matter if I walk a few more steps. (Asked) What is Mr. Feng's opinion on the current situation? (Answered) The central government has its own way. If you say that the central government has no way, I don't believe it. I am a member of the National Government. Who can say that the central government has no way? I can pull them to court. You are news reporters, so be careful when you speak and don't end up wearing a red hat. (Feng smiled and looked at the reporters when he said "north"). (Asked) Mr. Feng's opinion on the report of the investigation team. (Answered) After the report was published, many people asked me for my opinion. Before the government makes a concrete statement, I can only answer you based on my personal feelings. The three northeastern provinces are our land, and now they have been taken by others. The reports all represent the so-called justice and justice of the great powers towards semi-colonies. I have always advocated recovering the lost land by force. Besides everyone uniting to do it, relying on friends to help is only a temporary effect. (Asked) What is Mr. Feng's opinion on the situation of the Volunteer Army? (Answered) The Northeast Volunteer Army are all good lads, who dare to do it, but unfortunately there is no support. Today, they are still wearing single layers, which is almost like not wearing clothes. It is really heartbreaking to express countless sympathy for them.</p>
<p>Arriving in Zhangjiakou: According to a certain follower of Feng who returned to Beiping from Zhangjiakou on the evening of the 9th, the special train left Nankou and passed Xuanhua at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 9th. Huang Weigang, the brigade commander of the 29th Army, and his officers boarded the train to meet Feng. The special train stayed in Xuanhua for about a quarter of an hour before heading north. At 9:10, it arrived in Zhangjiakou. Song Zheyuan, the chairman of Chahar Province, and the heads of all departments welcomed him at the station. After Feng got off the train, he went to his residence, and Song Zheyuan followed him. The attendants and guards also got off the train. Because it was inconvenient to live in Chahar, Feng decided to go to Datong with his wife, Li Dequan, this week to quell outside rumors. He specifically sent me to Beiping to buy new books for research in his spare time. (Evening of the 9th)</p>
<h3>Eastern Hubei Remnant Bandits Retreat and Flee</h3>
<p>He Chengjun Goes to Southern Hubei to Reward Troops</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Longgang and Yansha, which have been occupied by bandits for several years, were valiantly attacked and recovered by the Southern Hubei Bandit Suppression Army led by Guo Rudong and Zhang Gang on the 3rd and 4th of this month. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek was deeply gratified and, in addition to sending a telegram of commendation, awarded 20,000 yuan to be handed over to Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun for rewarding the troops. He Chengjun had long planned to go to Southern Hubei for inspection and to supervise the suppression of remnant bandits. After receiving the order, he prepared to leave. On the 10th, He Chengjun led Chief of Staff Si Kezhuang, a staff officer, two adjutants, two telegraph operators, and constables from the Pacification Headquarters, and departed from Yangxin on four small steamers. He will set up an administrative office there. It is reported that He Chengjun is scheduled to arrive in Yangxin on the 11th, stay there briefly, and then go to the front to reward the troops and personally inspect Longgang and Yansha, so as to supervise the suppression of remnant bandits. At the same time, he will supervise the administrative inspector of the district and the county magistrates to quickly reorganize the locality. After completing matters in Yangxin, he will detour to inspect Echeng, Xianning, and other areas before returning to Hankou. Furthermore, Nanjing Mayor Shi Ying has suggested to He Chengjun that Longgang and Yansha should be incorporated into Tongshan, the county seat should be moved to Longgang, and a garrison area should be designated to ensure permanent peace and tranquility. This trip of He Chengjun may also include the task of surveying the situation and considering the urgency of the matter. It is noted that Yangxin and Daye both belong to Southern Hubei and are separated from Qichun, Guangji, and Huanggang in Eastern Hubei by the entire Yangtze River. It is possible that the remnant bandits from Jinjiazhai on the Anhui border who are harassing Huanggang are attempting to collude with</p>

<h3>Guangdong Army Breaks Through Bandit Nest in Western Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Peng Dehuai's Faction Has Lost Its Base in Western Jiangxi</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In Recent Days, the Various Units of the First Army Stationed in Southern Jiangxi Have Launched a Large-Scale Search and Suppression of Peng Dehuai's Bandit Faction in Western Jiangxi. On the 1st of This Month, Bandit Traces Were Discovered Near Guobu, and the Wang Regiment of the First Division Was Ordered to Go to Suppress Them Overnight. The First Battalion of the Wang Regiment Went Deep into the Bandit Area, Killing Dozens of Bandits. The Remaining Bandits Fled Toward the Qinjiang Area. Yesterday, More Than 3,000 Bandits Still Gathered in Front of the Zuo An Camp, Consisting of the Red Bandits' Pseudo-New Twelfth Division and the Pseudo-Training First and Second Detachments, as Well as the Pseudo-Hexi Independent Regiment. The First Army Quickly Sent the Li Zhen Unit of the First Regiment to Encircle and Suppress Them. The Bandit Troops Resisted Stubbornly. After Hours of Stalemate, The Fierce Bandits Were Again Defeated, and More Than Sixty Rifles Were Seized. Since Repeatedly Suffering Setbacks, Peng Dehuai Planned to Assemble All His Forces and Concentrate in the Dawang Cave to Attempt Activities. However, The First Army Discovered This in Advance and Sent the Li Zhen Unit of the First Regiment and the Peng Linsheng Unit of the Third Regiment to Directly Attack the Dawang Cave Bandit Nest and Sweep Away Peng Dehuai's Base. It Was Found That the Bandit Had Been Operating the Dawang Cave Nest for Years, and the Defense Works Were Extremely Solid. After Receiving the Order, The First, Third, and Second Regiments of the First Army Set Out on the 4th and Launched a Multi-Pronged Attack on the Bandit Nest on the 5th. After More Than Ten Frontal Assaults and Six Hours of Bloody Battle, the First Defense Line of the Bandit Nest Was Broken, Several Hundred Bandits Were Captured, More Than Three Hundred New-Style Rifles, Four Mortars, Three Machine Guns, and More Than Ten Sewing Machines Were Seized, and Countless Other Supplies and Printed Materials Were Transported for Two Days, Still Not Finished, Which Shows the Abundance of Their Accumulation.

Hundreds of Captives Were Taken, More Than Three Hundred Rifles Were Seized, Four Mortars Were Seized, Three Machine Guns Were Seized, and Several Sewing Machines and Other Items Were Piled Up Like Mountains. (2) The Fierce Battle Was Similar to That of Tangkeng. Bandit Corpses Were Everywhere, and Our Army Also Suffered Slight Casualties. (3) The Bandit Items Here Cannot Be Completely Transported in Two Days. I Will Return to Defense After the Procedures Are Completed. This Battle Was Successful, Thanks to Regiment Commander Li Zhen Taking the Lead and Setting an Example. The Above Is Reported by Telegram. Respectfully Submitted by Yang Youmin." (October 7)</p>
<h3>The Judicial Yuan Unified the Law and Decree Conference to Resolve Important Interpretations</h3>
<p>Adopted Children Have No So-Called Concurrent Status</p>
<p>Related to the Period of Proclaiming an Heir and Contesting Inheritance</p>
<p>A Wife Who Takes a Concubine May Request a Divorce</p>
<p>Beijing News: The Judicial Yuan's Unified Law and Decree Interpretation Conference Recently Resolved Interpretations Regarding Adopted Children, Inheritance, and Taking a Concubine, Which Are Extremely Important. The Following Is an Exploration of the Records:</p>
<p>Adopted Children: The Judicial Yuan Believes That the Meaning of Matters Regarding Adopted Children Has Been Repeatedly Submitted by the Higher Courts of Various Provinces for Interpretation. Yesterday, the Interpretation Conference Resolved That One Person May Not Be the Adopted Child of Two People at the Same Time. The Law Has Already Expressly Prohibited This, but There Is No Express Prohibition on the Only Son or Only Daughter Being the Adopted Child of Another Person, Which May Be Based on the Agreement Between the Parties. Before the Adoption Relationship Is Terminated, the Adopted Child's Relationship With His/Her Own Parents Cannot Be Restored. There Is No So-Called Concurrent Status. However, Since the Relationship of the Adopted Child Is, in Principle, the Same as That of a Child Born in Marriage, the Collateral Relatives Within the Eighth Degree of Relationship by Blood and the Collateral Relatives by Marriage Within the Fifth Degree of Relationship Whose Generation Is Not Appropriate May Not Be Adopted Children, So as to Avoid Confusion.</p>
<p>Inheritance: The Conference Also Resolved That the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code Does Not Have Provisions for Ancestral Temples. If the Inheritance Begins After the Implementation of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code, and the Parties Still Proclaim an Heir and Contest Inheritance, It Should Be Rejected Immediately. As for Requesting Confirmation of the Fact of Proclaiming an Heir Before the Implementation of the Civil Code, It Is Not Related to the Implementation of the Civil Code and Should Be Investigated and Adjudicated.</p>
<p>Taking a Concubine: Furthermore, the Family Section of the Civil Code Does Not Have Provisions for Concubines. After the Implementation of This Section, Taking a Concubine May Not Be the Purpose of Entering Into a Contract. If There Is Such Conduct, It Constitutes Adultery With Another Person, and His/Her Wife May Request a Divorce in Accordance With Section 2 of Article 1052 of the Civil Code. If the Wife Does Not Request a Divorce and Only Requests Separation, It May Be Considered a Legitimate Reason as Referred to in the Proviso of Article 1001 of the Civil Code. If a Concubine Contract Was Established Before the Implementation of the Family Section of the Civil Code, or If, After the Implementation of This Section, the Wife Expressly or Tacitly Recognized It and Took a Concubine, His/Her Wife May Not Base It on a Request for a Divorce. However, If There Is a Legitimate Reason for Not Being Able to Cohabit Because of This, He/She May Still Request Separation. As for the Living Expenses of the Family After the Wife Separates, If the Wife Has No Property, or Has Property but Does Not Have the Circumstances of Articles 1026, 1037, 1047, Paragraph 2 of 1048 of the Civil Code, All Should Be Paid by the Husband. If There Are Difficulties in Paying on Time, the Wife May Request That a Part of the Husband's Property Income Be Designated to Be Used for Payment.</p>
<h3>Gansu Provincial Government Determined to Prohibit the Cultivation of Opium</h3>
<p>Completely Prohibit It From Next Spring</p>
<p>Find Other Ways to Make Up for Insufficient Military Expenses</p>
<p>Lanzhou Air Mail: Gansu Is a Famous Province for Growing Opium, and the People Have Suffered Greatly. However, Over the Years, Warlords Have Regarded Opium Cultivation as a Wonderful Way to Raise Funds. The So-Called Opium Acreage Fine Amounts to More Than 4.79 Million Yuan Annually, and All Military Expenses Rely on This for Support. In Recent Years, Opium Sales Have Been Stagnant, and the People Only Suffer From the Harm of Opium Cultivation, but Do Not See Its Benefits. However, Whether Opium Is Cultivated or Not, the So-Called Opium Acreage Fine Must Still Be Apportioned Across the Board. Farmers Who Do Not Cultivate Opium Are Subjected to Both Heavy Taxes and Evil Reputations. There Is No More Excessive Policy Than This in the World. When Chairman Shao Came to Gansu, Many Gansu People Asked Whether to Implement Opium Prohibition. Shao Did Not Express Anything Definite, Because Gansu's Finances Had Fallen Into a Desperate Situation Due to Years of Disaster and Warfare. The Current Monthly Military Expenses Require 700,000 Yuan. Even If the Opium Acreage Fine Is Still Collected, It Is Not Enough. If It Is Abolished, There Will Be No Way. Moreover, Due to Traffic Obstruction in Gansu Province, Agricultural Products Cannot Be Exported Even in Times of Bumper Harvest. In Addition, Special Products Such as Water Tobacco and Furs Have Been Completely Unmarketable This Year, and All Daily Use Crafts Rely Entirely on Foreign Imports. The Only Items That Can Be Exchanged for Foreign Cash in This Province Are Almost Opium. If It Is Prohibited, Some Say That It Will Greatly Hinder the People's Economy. Therefore, It Is Still Under Careful Consideration. However, the Time for Sowing Winter Seedlings Is Approaching. If a Decision Is Not Made Again, Opium Will Inevitably Be Cultivated as Before Next Year. Therefore, the Provincial Government Held Repeated Meetings Last Month to Discuss This. Finally, Due to the Great Harm of Opium, the Decision Was Made to Completely Prohibit Cultivation at Two Meetings on the 27th and 30th. A Proclamation Was Issued Immediately. On the 3rd of This Month, a Strict Telegram From Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Was Received, Which Strengthened the Determination of Chairman Shao and Others to Prohibit Opium. The Provincial Government's Proclamation and Shao's Reply to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Telegram Are Recorded Separately Below.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government's Proclamation on Implementing Opium Prohibition States: "It Is Known That Prohibiting the Cultivation of Opium Poppies Is Extremely Important and Related to Domestic and Foreign Affairs. This Province Is a Region That Generally Produces Opium, So Its Harm Is More Severe Than That of Other Provinces. Although Various Previous Governments Have Repeatedly Ordered Investigations and Prohibitions, They Have Been In Vain Due to Frequent Banditry and Unstable Provincial Situation in Recent Years. Moreover, the Army Is Large and There Is No Source of Funds. They Had No Choice but to Compromise and Allow It. Year After Year, the Important Policy of Opium Prohibition Has Not Been Effectively Implemented. It Is Important to Know That the People Regard Food as Their Heaven. Although Opium Cultivation Can Temporarily Obtain Taxes and Profits, It Will Reduce the People's Food Supply and Cause Endless Troubles. For Example, During the Famine of the 18th Year of the Republic of China, Countless People Starved to Death in the Province. There Was No Food in the Homes of the People From One Night to the Next. Opium Cultivation Is Indeed a Terrible Threat. Qinghai Province Has Always Had Strict Opium Prohibition, and the People Are Extremely Wealthy, Which Can Serve as Clear Proof. Now That the Provincial Situation Is Stable, The Bandit Troubles on Various Roads Are Gradually Being Suppressed. Our Chairman and Others Are Renewing Political Orders and Starting Anew With the People. We Will Not Allow This Political Stain to Remain and Give Foreigners An Excuse. Now, After the 42nd and 43rd Provincial Affairs Meetings, It Was Resolved That Another Method Would Be Determined to Raise and Make Up for the Military Expenses of the Troops Stationed Throughout the Province. When a Proper Agreement Is Drafted, It Will Be Announced to Everyone. All Opium Seedlings, From Next Spring Onward, Will Be Completely Prohibited From Being Cultivated in All Parts of This Province. No One Is Allowed to Discover Another Plant or Seedling. We Must Fundamentally Eradicate Them. It Is Investigated That the Counties in Northwest Longxi All Cultivate Spring Opium, and the Counties in Southeast Cultivate Winter Seedlings. They Should Be Investigated and Prohibited as Soon as Possible to Eliminate the Roots. In Addition to Issuing Orders to Various County Governments to Effectively Investigate and Prohibit Them, This Is Combined With a Proclamation for All Farmers in the Province to Comply With. If There Are Unscrupulous People Who Violate the Order and Grow Them Secretly, Once Discovered or Reported, the Land Will Be Confiscated According to the Regulations, and the People Will Be Punished According to the Law. We Will Never Show Leniency. You Must Know That This Opium Prohibition Order Must Be Implemented. Our Government Will Send People to Investigate Secretly From Time to Time. Do Not Knowingly Fall Into the Legal Net and Incur Heavy Punishment. Do Not Violate This."</p>
<p>Shao Lizhi's Reply to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Telegram, Addressed to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou: "I Have Received Your Telegram, Revered Sir. Opium Is Extremely Harmful, As You Have Stated. Gansu Province Is Even Worse. During the Drought of the 18th Year of the Republic of China, More Than a Million People Starved to Death, All Because of the Extensive Cultivation of Opium. There Was Little Food Stored in the Homes. An Investigation of the Opium Farmers Throughout the Province Shows That, in the Least Affected Counties, No Less Than Five-Tenths of the Women and Children Are Also Suffering From Opium Poisoning. This Will Inevitably Lead to the Extinction of the Race. Since Our Assumption of Office, We Have Considered This Several Times. Initially, We Considered That the Military Expenses of Gansu Province in Recent Years Are All Derived From the So-Called Opium Acreage Fine, Which Amounts to 4.8 Million Yuan Annually. The Current Monthly Military Expenses of the Province Require 700,000 Yuan, Which Is Not Enough. If We Vigorously Implement Opium Prohibition Again and Abolish the Opium Acreage Fine, Military Expenses Will Be Even More Unsustainable. There Were Proposals to Prohibit It in Stages. Ultimately, Due to the Great Harm of Opium, We Would Rather Find Other Ways to Apportion and Make Up for It. We Must Completely Prohibit It. Furthermore, Because Many Counties in Southern Longxi Cultivate Winter Opium, We Resolved to Completely Prohibit Cultivation at the Two Provincial Affairs Meetings on the 27th and 30th of Last Month. We Immediately Issued a Proclamation to All Counties in the Province to Effectively Investigate and Prohibit It. Now That We Have Received Your Instructions, We Are Very Fortunate That It Coincides With Your Intentions. Moreover, We Are Able to Have Your Excellency Steadfastly Preside Over This Matter, and We Will Certainly Be Able to Achieve the Goal of Eliminating the Poison Thoroughly. In Addition to Strictly Following Your Instructions and Handling This Matter Seriously, We Are Sending This Telegram in Reply. I, Shao Lizhi, Bow and Salute. Jiang Yin. (October 9)</p>
<h3>Xia Douyin Asks to Resign as Chairman of Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Political Affairs Temporarily Handled by Yang Zaichun on His Behalf</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After Taking Office as Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Xia Douyin Immediately Resigned From His Original Positions as Commander, Division Commander, and Wuhan Garrison Commander, and Moved to the Lakeside Garden in Wuchang, Notifying All Committee Members, Department Heads, and Subordinate Staff That They Must Not Reside in Hankou to Avoid Hindering Work. He Seemed to Have the Greatest Determination to Reorganize Provincial Affairs. In the Middle, He Repeatedly Encountered Difficulties, but He Never Had Any Intention of Retiring. Today (the 11th), There Was a Sudden Rumor That Xia Douyin Asked the Central Government to Resign as Chairman, and He Did Not Go to the Government Office to Work on That Day. All Incoming and Outgoing Official Documents Were Entrusted to Secretary-General Yang Zaichun to Handle on His Behalf. The 44th Regular Meeting Was Also Temporarily Presided Over by Yang Zaichun. Xia Douyin Originally Belonged to the Military Group, and He Naturally Had No Experience in Politics. However, He Was Quite Principled and Courageous in Undertaking Affairs. At a Time When the Remnant Bandits Are About to Be Suppressed and the People Are Eager to Recuperate, the Provincial Government Bears the Highest Administrative Responsibility of the Province, and the Chairman Is Also the Person Responsible for the Provincial Government's Policy Implementation. It Seems Inappropriate to Express Passivity at This Time. According to News From Related Parties, Xia Douyin Is Quite Indifferent to Fame and Wealth. Previously, He Resolutely Took on the Post of Chairman, Originally Wanting to Make Some Arrangements, and He Declared That He Would Exert His Full Strength to Serve for Half a Year. Now That the Time Has Arrived, and Political Affairs Are Still Difficult to Fully Promote to Benefit, He Has the Intention of Being Tired of His Job, Which Is Also So as to Fulfill His Past Promises. It Is Also Heard That Hubei's Finances Are Extremely Difficult, and the Accumulation of Arrears in Political and Educational Expenses Has Reached More Than 3 Million Yuan. Together With Various Loans, the Total Deficit Is More Than 15.21 Million Yuan. On the Revenue Side, Because Various Counties Have Been Ravaged by Red Bandits for a Long Time, They Cannot Re-Impose Taxes on the People. On the Expenditure Side, It Is Difficult to Implement Austerity, and Even After Repeated Reductions, It Is Still Difficult to Provide Uniform Payments. At a Time When the Provincial Treasury Is Short of Funds, Xia Douyin May Feel the Pain of It Being Difficult to Cook Without Rice. However, Whether This Is One of the Reasons for His Resignation, We Still Dare Not Conjecture Randomly. (October 11)</p>
<h3>Tianjin-Pukou Railway Streamlines Railway Affairs</h3>
<p>Regularly Implements Responsible Transportation</p>
<p>Purchases Locomotives to Restore Express Delivery</p>
<p>Qian and Lu Come to Jinan From Tianjin to Inspect</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Qian Zongyuan and Lu Deting, Committee Members of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau, Completed Their Inspection of Railway Affairs in Tianjin as Ordered. At 9:00 AM on the 9th, They Took Train 201 From Pingpu to Jinan. Important Officials of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Stationed in Jinan All Arrived at the Station to Welcome Them. After Qian Zongyuan and Lu Deting Arrived in Jinan, They Telephoned the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to Discuss Joint Transportation and Locomotive Leasing Matters. They Scheduled to Inspect Jinan's Railway Affairs on the 10th, and Convened Personnel From the Mechanical, Traffic, Engineering, and Police Departments to Give Instructions. After Qian and Lu Completed Their Official Business in Jinan, They Will Go to the Xuzhou-Yanzhou Area for Inspection Within Two or Three Days. According to Qian, Director Gu (Mengyu) Is Now Determined to Greatly Streamline the National Railway Affairs. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway Runs Through the North and South and Is the Main Trunk Line of Our Country's Railways. Its Relationship Is Even More Important Than the Pinghan and Longhai Railways. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways Has Repeatedly Ordered This Railway Bureau to Actively Streamline It. This Bureau Has Formulated a Detailed Plan for Streamlining Railway Affairs and Will Implement It in Stages. The First Step Is to Implement Responsible Transportation and Telephone Dispatching. It Is Now Scheduled to Be Implemented on November 1st. The Responsible Transportation Method Is That the Railway Bureau Will Be Fully Responsible for Goods From All Places, No Matter Which Station Along the Line They Are Transported To. If There Are Any Losses, the Railway Bureau Will Be Responsible for Compensation. However, the Freight Rate Will Increase by 10%. This Not Only Causes No Loss to Merchants, but Also Has Three Benefits, Because Before Responsible Transportation, Merchants Used to Insure Their Goods, and the Insurance Premium Sometimes Exceeded 10% of the Freight Rate. Now That the Railway Bureau Is Responsible for Transportation, (1) Merchants Can Know the Exact Amount of Freight Costs and Can Calculate in Advance When Selling Goods. At the Same Time, Other Scattered and Illegal Expenses Can Also Be Avoided. (2) Not Only Can Responsible Transportation Be Applied to Goods From All Places Along the Tianjin-Pukou Line, but in the Future, They Can Also Cross the River and Be Directly Transported to Shanghai and Hangzhou. (3) Merchants Can Use the Goods Bill of Lading Issued by the Railway Bureau to Mortgage It at the Bank and Then Use the Mortgage Money to Engage in Other Businesses, Seeking Profits. As for the Traffic Telephone, It Is to Completely Eliminate Railway Staff's Malpractice, Because in the Past, the Right to Allocate Freight Cars Was Controlled by the Station Master, Which Led to Many Malpractices. In Order to Eliminate These Malpractices, the Railway Bureau Decided to Take Back the Right to Allocate Freight Cars and Hand It Over to the Committee. Traffic Telephones Will Be Set Up at the Stations Along the Line, and Traffic Telephone Offices Will Be Set Up in Pukou, Xuzhou, and Jinan. All Freight Cars Along the Line Will Be Directly Ordered by the Committee to Implement It Through Long-Distance Telephone Calls, Depending on the Situation. The Current Traffic Telephone Has Been Set Up in Jinan, and the Jinan-Tianjin Connection Is Being Purchased and Erected. It Can Also Be Completed Soon. The Reason Why I Was Ordered to Go North This Time Is to Inform the Employees and Staff Along the Line of This Matter and to Inspect the Status of Railway Affairs. After Completing My Official Business in Jinan, I Will Go to Yanzhou and Xuzhou for Inspection in Two or Three Days. As for Restoring Express Trains, Tianjin-Pukou Express Trains Have Been Suspended for a Long Time Due to a Lack of Vehicles. Now the Railway Bureau Has Used Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity) to Order Eight Locomotives and Twenty Third-Class Passenger Steel Cars From the United Kingdom. Each Locomotive Costs 170,000 Yuan, and Each Passenger Car Costs 40,000 Yuan. They Can Be Transported Here in February Next Year. After They Are Transported Here, Passenger Trains Will Be Added and the Traffic Situation of the Tenth Year of the Republic of China Will Be Restored. Before These Cars Are Transported Here, the Railway Bureau Plans to Lease Large-Wheel Locomotives to Restore the Tianjin-Pukou Special Express Train First. When I Was in Tianjin, I Discussed Leasing Large-Wheel Locomotives With the Beijing-Nanning Railway Bureau, but There Were No Extra Large-Wheel Locomotives on That Line, So There Were No Results. After I Arrive in Jinan, I Will Consult With the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to Lease Large-Wheel Locomotives From That Line at a High Price, So as to Restore the Tianjin-Pukou Special Express Train as Soon as Possible. This Railway Is Now Ordering 250,000 Track Ties From the United States, Each Root Costing 1.3 Yuan. They Can Be Transported to Beijing in February and Distributed to Various Sections to Replace Decayed Track Ties. This Railway's Revenue Has Gradually Improved. The Total Expenses of the Whole Railway Are 1.25 Million Per Month. There Was a Deficit of More Than 400,000 in July and August. In September, Revenue Reached More Than 1.7 Million. After Deducting All Expenses, the Deficit of July and August Has Been Made Up. Now That Railway Affairs Have Been Streamlined, Revenue Will Naturally Be More Prosperous, and There Is Hope That It Will Reach 2 Million Each Month. (9th)</p>

<p>The Whole County's Fortune-Telling Blind Men Petition: Social Evolution, Scientific Prosperity, Divination and Astrology, Originally Banned. The First District Party Department of This County Believes That There Are Many Diviners and Astrologers in the County. The Committee Resolved to Present It to the County Party Department and Forward It to the Public Security Bureau for Strict Prohibition.

Then, Branch Director Peng Telegraphed the Situation to the General Bureau for Instructions. The General Bureau Maintained the Authority of the Government Office and Stated That Detention Was Not Over and Could Not Be Released. The Blind Men Did Not Get What They Wanted and Dispersed Like Birds and Beasts. It Was a Boring, Pitiful, and Ridiculous Situation.</p>
<p>The Whole County's Silk Factories Failed to Resume Work: More Than 20,000 Employees From 25 Silk Factories in Wuxi County, Because They Requested That the Factory Restore the Labor-Capital Agreement Revised on May 1 of Last Year, Which Was Not Fulfilled. On the Afternoon of the 8th, Female Workers, Led by Gan Sheng, Started Trouble and Implemented a Work Slowdown. On That Day, Twelve Silk Factories in the East and North Districts Struck First. The Strike Extended to Various Factories in the South District on the Following Day (9th), Implementing a General Strike. The Party and Government Authorities Invited Both Labor and Capital to Try to Mediate. However, Director He of the Department of Industry Believed That at a Time When the Silk Industry Was Declining, the Sudden Occurrence of a Strike Trend Was Not Appropriate to Allow to Continue for a Long Time. In Addition to Telegraphing the County Magistrate to Inquire About the Details, He Also Sent Inspector Zhou Juesheng to Wuxi to Assist in Handling It. At the Same Time, the Provincial Party Department Also Believed That the Current Trend Was Extremely Serious and Specifically Sent Civil Affairs Instructor Sun Danchen to Wuxi to Mediate. After the Two Committees, Sun and Zhou, Arrived in Wuxi, They Immediately Consulted With County Magistrate Chen, Executive Committee Member Xu Tongji of the County Party Department, and Gui Wochen to Seek a Solution. They All Agreed to Resume Work First and Find a New Way to Thoroughly Solve It. On the Morning of the 11th, Fifteen Silk Factories, Including Yifeng and Santai, Resumed Work at the Same Time. However, A Small Number of Female Workers Hurried to Stop Them and Beat the Female Workers Who Had Resumed Work. After a Long Time of Disturbance, Except for Jinji, Minfeng, and Hefeng Factories, Which Continued to Work as Usual, the Other 22 Factories Remained Shut Down. After Receiving the News, the Party and Government Authorities Believed That If the Labor Unrest Was Delayed and Not Resolved, There Was a Fear That Unexpected Disputes Would Occur. They Immediately Agreed That the County Party Department and the County Government Would Jointly Issue a Proclamation, Limiting the Factories to Resume Work Across the Board on the 12th. If There Were Any Obstacles, the County Would Dispatch Police Teams to Suppress Them Effectively. All Six Conditions Put Forward by the Labor Side Will Be Discussed and Decided After Work Resumes.

After the Various Factories Sent Back Three Echos Yesterday Morning, Most of the Honest Female Workers Had Already Arrived at the Factories to Work. However, a Portion of the Female Workers Believed That the Conditions Had Not Yet Been Discussed and Decided, and Work Could Not Be Resumed Suddenly. They Divided Into Several Teams and Hurried to Various Factories, From the North to the West and to the South District, to Stop Work. There Was Disturbance for a Long Time, and the Various Factories Still Did Not Resume Work. The Party and Government Sides Also Immediately Convened a Meeting, but There Was No Solution Yet.</p>

<h3>Representatives Conference of the Jiangsu Province Middle School Faculty and Staff Association (II)</h3>
<p>The 11th Representatives Conference of the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Faculty and Staff Association continued in the second courtyard of Nanchang from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on the 11th. Wu Dezhang presided over the meeting and Xue Jianwu recorded the proceedings. Liu Beihe, Section Chief of the Education Fund Management Office, attended the meeting by invitation to explain the content and current status of the office's revenue and expenditure funds. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Continuing the discussion of proposals, except for the merging and retaining of various cases, the following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the "Education and Training Integration Method" issued by the Education Department this year, the schools should mutually study the implementation methods. It was resolved that there would be two methods: 1. The association will convene a conference of training and education from middle schools throughout the province during this semester to discuss the integrated training and education method. 2. At the next conference, representatives from each school will report on the implementation process. (2) Regarding the implementation of ability grouping for Chinese, English, and math in junior high school, two methods were decided upon: 1. Send a letter to the school association to earnestly implement the method and contribute opinions (increase class hours, extracurricular guidance, etc.). 2. Hand over the issue to the Training and Education Association for discussion and specific methods. (3) Regarding the value of researching and improving material selection and teaching methods in various subjects in secondary education, how should we find ways to connect in order to achieve the effect of mutual learning and observation? It was resolved that the association should continue to hold subject-specific research meetings. A science research meeting will be convened this semester. (4) How should this association express its opinion on the League of Nations investigation team report? It was resolved that the school that originally proposed the idea should draft a statement, consult with the Middle School Association, and then send a telegram to all sectors to awaken the public. (5) With national difficulties intensifying and civil war breaking out again, should this association send a telegram to the whole country to ask for an end to internal strife and united resistance against foreign aggression? Approved. (6) How should this association express its support for the Northeast Volunteer Army? It was resolved that the association should send letters to the faculty and staff associations of each school to quickly find ways to raise funds to support the Northeast Volunteer Army (such as having staff and students economize on expenses and transfer funds to support the Volunteer Army, as well as through fundraising events, etc.). (7) Students who have passed the Education Department’s joint entrance examination should be recommended by the Education Department to the Ministry of Education for admission to domestic universities without examination, and those who are poor or have special talents should be given free preferential treatment by the government as an incentive. Approved. (8) Moving the Management Office to Zhenjiang: Approved. (9) Requesting the Education Department to reduce tuition fees for provincial school students: Approved. (10) This association should welcome the inclusion of rural normal schools in this province: Approved. (11) The location of the next representatives conference: It was decided to be in Xuzhou (if there are special circumstances, it will be in Wuxi). (12) This association should print a membership directory: Approved. After the discussions, it was 1:00 p.m. The Jingnv Middle School hosted a public banquet for the representatives. In the afternoon, colleagues from Nanzhong hosted a tour of various scenic spots, and the first executive committee meeting was held at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. In the evening, the faculty and staff association of Nanzhong hosted a public banquet for the representatives. At 8:00 p.m., the Nanzhong Music Troupe held a music concert to welcome the representatives. The music was excellent and uplifting.</p>
<p>Liu Beihe’s report briefly stated that he felt very guilty about the fact that the provincial schools could not receive funds and were in debt. He said that theoretically there was nothing to say, but in reality, there were all kinds of difficulties (listing many facts, the important ones being that the special education funds could not be effectively divided, resulting in their misappropriation, and that the Management Office had no power or influence, and the financial bureaus of the counties only followed the orders of the provincial authorities, leading to biased fund allocations. Only Wu County and Changshu County in Jiangsu's 61 counties had Management Office members supervising them, and they promptly withdrew and deposited educational funds in banks. The remaining counties had no such procedures. The Management Office had sent a letter to the provincial authorities asking them to order all counties to separate the educational funds effectively, but the provincial authorities had not responded.) The Management Office was working hard to find ways to overcome the difficulties. The audit committee could sign off on a portion of the provincial school's July expenses and the rural teachers' elementary school and other schools' August expenses today, as well as half a month's expenses for schools that had changed principals. After settling the funds in the treasury, there was still a deficit of more than 130,000 yuan, so the banks could not immediately pay the issued notices and would have to wait for the county funds to be transferred before they could be paid. At the beginning of last month, the Management Office borrowed 560,000 yuan from 19 counties, using the winter grain tax as collateral. Since the establishment of the Management Office, this type of borrowing has been done eight times. In the past, about 200,000 yuan was borrowed, but last year, more was borrowed, 500,000 yuan, due to the floods. As a result, 140,000 yuan was received. This year's harvest is more promising. If all the funds can be collected, two months' expenses can be paid. Currently, Suzhou has already replied, first sending 70,000 yuan, Changshu 20,000 yuan, and Zhenjiang Danyang 13,000 yuan, saying that the funds will be transferred on the 15th. Your association requested that the expenses for July, August, and September be paid in full within October, which is impossible in reality. What is the benefit of an empty reply? In short, the Management Office is actively finding ways to pay off the July expenses within October. In addition, the living expenses for normal school students should be advanced one level so that all provincial schools can receive monthly payments, which would not be a problem. Otherwise, there was a method to pay the living expenses of normal school students first in the previous year, and this matter does not need to be requested from the government, and the Management Office can be notified by letter. As for the temporary expenses of the 18th year, they have already been settled, and the matter will be answered after investigation. As for your association's resolution to suggest to the provincial government to guarantee education funds, the Management Office has already made suggestions but has not achieved results, so we can work together to improve and strive to remedy the situation.</p>

The bureau will formulate the test questions and send personnel to the schools on a regular basis to conduct the tests. Preparations are currently underway, and it is expected to begin within the next week.</p>

<h3>Situ Guang Creates New National Record in Triple Jump at 16th North China Games</h3>
<p>—Score of 13.94 Meters—</p>
<p>Shandong Wins Women's Championship in Track and Field</p>
<p>Beijing Wins Men's Senior and Intermediate Championships</p>
<p>Women's Softball Throw Also Sets National Record</p>
<p>Kaifeng Electric, 11th - The 16th North China Games track and field competition has ended. Beijing won the men's senior and intermediate championships, and Shandong won the women's championship. Situ Guang of Hebei Province set a new national record of 13.94 meters in the men's senior triple jump. The women's softball throw of 39.17 meters also set a new national record. The all-around sports and ball games will begin on the 12th.</p>
<p>After many days of preparation and one postponement, the 16th North China Games, during this period of national tension and urgent foreign invasion, were held in Henan on National Day this year. A total of 826 people participated, including eight provinces: Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, Henan, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shandong, and Liaoning, as well as the two cities of Beijing and Qingdao, totaling ten units. Liaoning was occupied by the brutal Japanese, and all the heroes were scattered. The strength of Liaoning was far from that of the previous session, but the Liaoning heroes bravely participated, and regardless of the results, it was enough to show that our three provinces will not perish. The opening ceremony began at 8:00 AM. At 7:00 AM, the Longting Road was crowded with people, and there was an overwhelming surge of enthusiasm. The road was clogged with traffic and carriages, and military police maintained order. Athletes from ten provinces gathered in one field, standing solemnly in front of the rostrum, full of masculine energy and awe-inspiring power. After a cannon shot, the opening ceremony began. The opening speech was delivered by Liu Zhi, the chairman of the Henan Provincial Government and chairman of the conference. This was followed by speeches by Dun Li, the executive member of the North China Sports Federation, and Li Jingzhai, the representative of the Central Party Headquarters. Airplanes donated by the people of Henan to the Central Government performed in the sky and dropped leaflets. The athletes paraded around for a week as usual, and then the competition began. The details of the first day for women are recorded below.</p>
<p>The dazzling prizes: The reporter went to the stadium to visit and walked to the prizes section. The room was full of dazzling prizes, but the most outstanding was the banner donated by the Shandong Provincial Government, which was full of artistic ideas, such as the silver cup from Chairman Lu, the silver shield from the Shandong Party Headquarters, and the banners from Education Director He Siyuan and other departments, with novel styles and bright colors, which were extremely gorgeous. The gold cup from Chairman Liu Zhi of Henan Province was also quite outstanding.</p>
<p>Declaration of Liaoning athletes: The declaration of the Liaoning Province athletes attending the 16th North China Games states, "This year, the various provinces and cities of North China are holding the 16th Games in Kaifeng today. The amateur athletes of Liaoning residing in Beijing held preliminary elections in Beijing and selected a number of senior, junior, and national defense athletes to participate in the Games. We hereby respectfully declare the true significance of this participation to the people of the whole country, hoping that they will appreciate it. Since the Three Eastern Provinces Incident last autumn, the people of the Three Eastern Provinces have been displaced and subjected to suffering and humiliation. We thought that the incident would end soon, and we would be able to return to our homeland, live and work in peace. But time flies, and more than a year has passed. Now that our rivers and mountains are broken and the people are displaced, how can we have the heart to engage in these timely pleasures? However, considering that in past North China Games and National Games, our Northeast athletes have actively participated and shown their skills, and that we all have our籍隸in the eastern provinces, we have never dared to forget that the Three Eastern Provinces are a part of our country's North China territory, even though we are in turmoil. Now, although we are temporarily occupied by the enemy, it is especially important to have a correct representation to the Chinese and foreign audiences. This is why we endure humiliation and bear the burden, determined to participate, not for the vanity of scoring points and winning awards, nor to compete with our domestic compatriots, but only to ensure that the Liaoning flag is permanently displayed at the North China Games, to awaken the people of the country to the fact that there are still the Three Eastern Provinces in China's territory, and to train ourselves, striving forward until the rivers and mountains are restored, and vowing to never change. We especially hope that the people of the whole country will work together so that the Liaoning athletes of the 17th Games will be pre-selected in Liaoning Province, which is what we pray for and strive for. Furthermore, Mr. Liu Changchun, who represented China at the World Games this year, should also return to the country and represent Liaoning Province at the National Games, so that both China and foreign countries will know that Liaoning is Chinese territory, and the people of Liaoning are Chinese people, and we will never forget this. We especially hope to prove this with our actions at this Games. This is our declaration. October 10, 21st year."</p>

<h3>Breaking Open the Mute Gourd Simultaneously</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>If one were to use the writing style of the Investiture of the Gods to describe this matter, one would surely say: there are three star lords from the upper realm, each carrying a large gourd on their backs, stepping on clouds, heading to Geneva, Nanjing, and Tokyo; opening the gourd lids at the same time. When not opened, everything is at rest; when opened, there is a sudden loud noise, and in an instant, countless rays of rosy light rise up, dazzling the people of the five continents and nations, one by one. Some clap their hands, some shake their heads, some stick out their tongues, and some glare; these three identical large gourds are simply wondrous and unfathomable!</p>
<p>The League of Nations' investigation report has already been published. The world's public opinion on the medicine in this gourd is both satisfied and dissatisfied. All those who are satisfied believe that the gourd has immense value; it is clearly a golden gourd, a silver gourd, an eight-treasure gourd, a divine gourd. All those who are dissatisfied complain that the medicine in the gourd contains oiliness, clearly an oily gourd; contains astringency, clearly a vinegar gourd; contains anesthesia, clearly a wine gourd.</p>
<p>In the end, is the medicine in the gourd a miraculous elixir or rotten medicine? Before it has been proven effective, it remains a wondrous and unfathomable mute gourd!</p>
<h3>Aiming</h3>
<p>— ·Tai· Sheng</p>
<p>The heat isn't up to par yet.</p>
<p>The Northeast Beidaying Arsenal first aimed and bombed; then came another aiming at the Zhabei bombardment fort. Moreover, they aimed quite accurately, not missing by many kilometers.</p>
<p>This shows that the enemy usually puts effort into street fighting and field battles. Once they take up a gun, all you hear are bullets 'dede', either they don't aim, or they aim accurately!</p>
<p>As for our aiming methods? Apart from the brave men in the Black Mountain and White Water mountain valleys and forests who can strike fear into the enemy, the sharpshooters who can aim accurately and hit their targets are said to still be in practical training!</p>
<p>Perhaps some people don't believe it, thinking that I'm understating it. After the long-term training of the twenty-first year of the Republic, they still can't even aim? During these twenty-one years, there has been much clamor, you aiming at me, I aiming at you. Sometimes we play well, and indeed everyone greets each other with a clear gun and clear bullet. Then we arrange the formation and everyone aims again. But sometimes the game doesn't go well, and when things get heated, you get a cold aim, with no time to fight back, no time to defend.</p>
<p>Is this method wrong? If we could turn this "skill" around, wouldn't it be enough to recover the Northeast and flatten the three islands!</p>
<p>However, our shooters, who have always been humble and peaceful, are still saying with "self-deprecation," "The heat" isn't up to par yet, we need to practice more, then go into battle!</p>
<p>So everyone continues to aim at each other with real guns and real bullets, performing a chest-piercing and abdomen-penetrating public performance for the world!</p>
<p>We can only secretly fret, waiting for the time when these shooters' "heat" is up to par, and then aim the gun outwards, at the outside.</p>
<h3>Folk Songs of Village Children and Rural Women</h3>
<p>— ·Jun· Shuo</p>
<p>With considerable allegorical and satirical significance.</p>
<p>In ancient times, imperial envoys collected folk songs, not neglecting the ballads of the people, because they were helpful to government and education, which the government did not tire of seeking in detail. Later generations also have field songs and mountain songs, coming from the mouths of village children and rural women, matching the allegorical meanings of ancient poets! And similar to the tone of satire and remonstrance. If someone collected them into books of songs and admonitions, or to guide children, it seems to fit the principles of new education. I will offer one or two examples based on what I have heard, not knowing if they will be ridiculed by refined gentlemen?</p>
<p>I really want to climb high mountains, but the straw sandals on my feet can't be made. White rice is delicious, but the fields are hard to plant; fresh fish is delicious, but the nets are hard to climb.</p>
<p>Looking at this kind of mountain song in the six meanings of poetry, it can be considered to fit the meaning of metaphor. Saying in the mouth "I want to climb high mountains" shows ambition! However, the straw sandals for climbing the mountain cannot be made, surely because one cannot encourage and strive for oneself, and can only watch others climb the mountain from the foot of the mountain. The next two sentences say that to enjoy rights, one must fulfill obligations, isn't that very clear and understandable?</p>
<p>Red balsam, white balsam, my parents did not raise me well. My stepmother pushed me into the green grass, and the city grass blooming is also pitiful.</p>
<p>This song fits the meaning of allusion. Zhu Xi said, "Allusion is first speaking of other things, leading to the words being sung." The balsam sentences are speaking of other things first, then referring to the abuse by the stepmother. The last sentence also seems to contain the meaning of metaphor, which is deeply worth pondering.</p>
<h3>Abnormal Fear of Trouble</h3>
<p>— Tai· Yi· Wei· Sheng</p>
<p>Like Sugar-Fried Chestnut Stalls and Small Eateries</p>
<p>The habit of people in our country is to keep many things secret, especially those related to technology. Every time they gain something, they treasure it deeply, and unless they find the right person, they are unwilling to impart it lightly; even if they do impart it, they often keep the most important and profound part reserved, until they are twelve-thousand percent sure before they take it out to teach it to their most trusted disciple. As the saying goes: "Teach the apprentice, and the master is gone," that's the meaning. In Shanghai dialect, it's called "selling guanzi (keeping something back)." Therefore, if you want to learn a thorough skill from a craftsman in China, it is not easy. However, I have recently discovered an abnormal situation, which is what I have learned from sugar-fried chestnut stalls and many small eateries and restaurants. The technique of frying sugar-fried chestnuts, although it cannot be said to be very mysterious, can at least be comparable to the sauced meat and sauced duck of Lukaochien. It is said that the cooking of Lukaochien's sauced meat and sauced duck uses a secret method passed down from ancestors, which also contains a piece of mythology enough to amaze the minds of the nineteenth century. In that case, sugar-fried chestnuts should also be treasured in the same way; but not only do they not treasure it, but they make it very public; every sugar-fried chestnut stall must set up a stove at the door, how to put sugar, how to put sand, how to put chestnuts, how to add firewood and use fire, how to stir with a shovel, how to sift out the chestnuts from the sand, all are displayed without reservation, causing smoke to rise from the roadside and charcoal ash to cover the front of the shop. Small eateries and restaurants, on the other hand, it's not that they don't have a place behind their shops where they can set up stoves and display knives and chopping boards, but they insist on setting up the kitchen in front of the shop, or even right at the door, and that wave after wave of gas, oil, and fishy smells make diners feel a little unwelcome. I think these two industries are making their technology too public. Perhaps they think that the color and aroma presented in the wok contain powerful advertising effects, which is unknowable. In my opinion, I would advise them to be a little more secretive, because technicians working with bare chests will remind foreigners of Africa or India.</p>
<h3>A Paradise-like Morning</h3>
<p>— Rong· Yu</p>
<p>It's in the countryside, not in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Living in Shanghai, I sleep in a pigeon-coop-like room every night, and when I wake up, I always feel depressed and have trouble breathing. If you want to run around on Jing'an Temple Road! It will be difficult for your honored feet; and the dung trucks and garbage trucks along the way will also make you uncomfortable. Alas! Shanghai's morning, noon, evening, midnight, and then tomorrow's morning, are always a burst of noise and a burst of stench. People living here will always have a discount on their lifespan.</p>
<p>In these few months, due to my job, I moved to the countryside. That place is six miles away from the focus of destruction, the Great Shanghai, Hongkou Park, and six cities away from Jiangwan Town. Although it is inconvenient to go in and out, the immersion, hustle and bustle, and noise of urban life are swept away.</p>
<p>I get up at five o'clock every morning and always go for a run along the fields. At that time, the dew drops on the grass sparkle like pearls. The dew, having fully absorbed the moisture of the autumn dew, cries out energetically. Looking into the distance, a plume of water vapor in the forest, unevaporated by the sunlight, rises and falls like clouds. At that time, the sky is clear; the earth is quiet, and a burst of morning air rushes into the nose, as cool and clear as sweet dew.</p>
<p>What adorns this morning? A few thatched houses, smoke rising from the chimneys into the sky. Beside a clear stream, a strong and naturally beautiful village girl is washing rice and vegetables. A group of chickens and ducks come out of the shed and look for food in the courtyard. The birds in the trees also begin to say good morning to the people!</p>
<p>The eastern sun rises. In every field, there are always a few villagers, old and young, male and female, some weeding, some planting vegetables. There are also shouts echoing on the main road, it turns out that villagers are carrying vegetables to Shanghai to sell.</p>
<p>After such a walk, my feet feel slightly sore and numb. Looking at the watch on my arm, it points to six o'clock. I think in the dance halls of Great Shanghai, the fashionable young men and women are just groggily going back to sleep!</p>
<h3>Record of Gains and Losses of Famous Plays</h3>
<p>— ·Ti· Gong</p>
<p>On the eve of National Day, Mr. Shu Shifu of the Jiangsu Finance Department, hosted a banquet for his daughter's wedding. Senior Tian Xin specially invited the Er Er Society to perform at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road. At the event, Misses Zhu and Shi suddenly joined the performance. Although the Fourth Son's voice was thin, he used it well, with excellent charm. The Little Foreign Tune was especially impressive. The Princess's costume was extremely beautiful, and her singing strictly adhered to the rules, not merely showing off with skill. They are both rare female performers of the present time. Some say that one of the two is a concubine of Mr. Feng Gengguang. I don't know if it's true, but that evening Mr. Feng was running around busily, so I suspect it may be true.</p>
<p>On the evening of the seventh, a certain wealthy family celebrated a birthday. Society member Hui Chang invited Mr. Xu Ziquan to sing "Zhuangyuan Pu" on their behalf. Mr. Xu's respected father, Elder Lingyun, is a well-known figure in the art world, with profound family learning that is extraordinary. Moreover, Mr. Xu specially invited Mr. Yu Zhenfei to assist him, and the society members were delighted to have a rare treat for their ears. Unexpectedly, the host disliked it as unlucky and politely asked to change the play. Mr. Xu then claimed to be ill and did not come, and Jiang Gan of "Heroes' Gathering," who had originally agreed to play the role I was assigned, also canceled, much to my disappointment. Two famous plays: one was gained unintentionally, and the other was lost unexpectedly. Every drink and every morsel is destined.</p>
<h3>Postal Companions Entering the Pass (10)</h3>
<p>— Seeking Happiness Hermit</p>
<p>Although Lu Boqin had been engaged to her for several months, it was the first time he had discovered that she possessed such supreme nobility and beauty, almost beyond what he could imagine in his everyday state of mind. She, as a woman, adorns herself for the one who pleases her, and had specially put on a new look at home, saying that a girlfriend had invited her to go out, and that she had deliberately made this kind of embellishment. And Boqin, in his astonishment, felt his soul cry out, and he was given a serious indication: This heavenly-like lover belongs to you; as long as you nod your head lightly and follow her proposal, you can immediately join hands and go to another paradise, forming a divine couple, and sharing the most perfect happiness. If you still insist on those pedantic views now and reject her, not only will this lovely person be lost immediately, which you will not be able to give up; but also, when you are in front of her pleasing face, how can you really bear to make a firm and impersonal refusal to her, causing her to be extremely sad and disappointed with you? Thinking like this, he almost softened to the point where he had no strength left, and the firm decision that he had carefully considered and strengthened last night was about to be completely overturned and abandoned.</p>
<p>Tong Yizhen slowly put down the silk umbrella that was across her shoulder and put it away; then stretched out a slender jade finger and swept it across his gaze, which was looking at her mesmerizedly, and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Silly! What are you spacing out about again? You're staring at me with your eyes wide open, do you think I don't look good today?"</p>
<p>Lu Boqin was slightly shocked and quickly replied: "Very good! Very good!"</p>
<p>"Really good?" Tong Yizhen smiled sweetly again. Then she put the silk umbrella on Lu Boqin's lap, sat down on another stone drum next to him, and brought up the main topic again: "I know you can't say I'm not good, and you can't not love me. You should have a very happy answer to what I said yesterday, right?"</p>
<p>"???????" He was still silent.</p>
<p>"This is a big matter related to my lifelong happiness! Why are you still hesitating? Good person! Don't make me worry too much, answer me quickly." Although she was a little anxious and angry, she still urged him in a soft and charming voice.</p>

<h3>Calm Financial and Gold Markets</h3>
<p>Very Peaceful Process. Yesterday's standard gold situation was very calm, with the price slightly declining. The entire day only saw a difference of three taels. The total audit result showed a slight drop of five qian. Trading in the market was very scattered. At the opening, despite the decline in silver prices and exchange rates, the European market was stable, the United States was buying a lot, and the rise in US cotton had an impact. Then, it once trended higher, almost because foreign exchange was seen to be firm, and half a stop was reduced. Then it turned flat, and even more so because retail multi-headed traders sold off, the downstream market was extremely mediocre, and the various firms were watching and waiting. Because it was Wednesday, there was a lack of exchange tickets in the market, so the price stood between seven hundred and thirty-four taels. As for the spot market, its trend was more agile than the previous market, with Qian Changxiang and others selling to the Central Bank at a price of thirty-five taels. However, it is said that there were a total of six or seven hundred bars. The detailed situation for the entire day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening fell by one tael and three qian. The November opening fell by one tael and three qian, to seven hundred and thirty-three taels and two qian. Although large bars fell by one-sixteenth and US silver one-eighth, the forward prices were seen to return slightly, but they were not moved by it. In fact, my cotton reported a large increase of more than ten pounds. Following this, items were bought in, adding to thirty-four taels. However, Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Heng, Zhaofeng, Chang, and retail investors sold out immediately, retreating to thirty-two taels and seven qian. At 11:00 AM, the US dollar was traded at 375 against the US dollar. Afterwards, with the bank absorbing 625 in January and Shen Kang, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongfu, Taiheng, Fuchang, Tianfeng, Yongyi, and Fengyong vigorously buying, especially with China Bank selling half a dollar in January to Citibank, the price frequently rose to thirty-six taels at 9:20 AM. At this time, Bingxing, Fuyu, Hongkang, and Yongsheng came to sell, returning by about two taels. However, fearing that HSBC's listed British gold would shrink by 125 and the US dollar by 375, it became thirty-five taels and eight qian. However, the market was seen to be loose. October British gold was traded at 125, and January US dollars were bought by Zhongfu Wheat Company at 5625. Also, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, Richang, Yifeng, Yuanda, Yong and others sold out, so at 9:30 AM it was thirty-three taels and seven qian. Afterwards, there was a one tael, two or three qian market head. Around 10:30 AM, the Central Bank opened 385 cash bars at a price of thirty-five taels, so Qian Changxiang entered futures, and Tong Taichang and others followed suit. Also, in December, the US dollar was entered by Huabi and Old Citibank at a price of 4375, so it was added to thirty-five taels and two qian. Later, the US dollar traded two-five this month and HSBC released 125 British gold this month, so the gold price was slightly suppressed by one tael. However, the situation was peaceful. From 10:40 AM to 11:50 AM, there were only a few qian fluctuations, with prices above thirty-four taels. Transactions from all parties were also rare, but Hengyu, Hongkang, Yongshen, Changyong, Yuhe, etc. slightly came out, and Yifeng, Yongyuan, Xingyong, and Yuantai entered. Near closing, retail multi-headed traders slightly spit out, so the afternoon closed only at thirty-three taels and seven qian. Following this, two or three qian were recovered and items came in.</p>
<p>Afternoon Entering a Stagnant State. After the market opened at thirty-three taels and seven qian, there were only two qian fluctuations. Firms such as Hengyu and Bingxing entered items, adding three or four qian to thirty-four taels and one qian at 2:30 PM. Afterwards, it became extremely silent, but Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yong and others slightly sold out, and at 3:00 PM it was thirty-three taels and eight qian. Afterwards, there was a one or two qian rotation, and the market closed at 3:30 PM at thirty-four taels, a decrease of five qian compared to the previous day. According to the whole day, the maximum was thirty-six taels and the minimum was thirty-two taels and seven qian, a difference of two taels and three qian. The red bar was added to nine taels, two qian, and five.</p>
<p>The Posted Price Mostly Relied on Ten Taels. The outside posted price was changed to eight hundred and three taels because the US dollar was posted small at three-seven-five, calculated to press sixty-seven taels to sixty-nine taels. In the afternoon, it was sixty-nine taels, pressing more than ten taels more than the previous day. The registered book was thirty-six taels this month and thirty-four taels next month. The make-up water was thirty-four taels for the whole day.</p>

<h3>Little Change in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Listed Price Reduced by Half a Stop.</p>
<p>Yesterday's silver market reported a narrowing exchange rate, falling by one fen to one fen and one eighth-seven-five to the Shanghai market's exchange tickets, which was almost stimulated. HSBC's listed price was reduced by half a stop, calculated as British gold one two five and US dollars squeezed the exchange rate, so three seven five was reduced. The rest, except for Hong Kong, remained unchanged, and all were also more expensive. The domestic market was first flat, then tight, and then turned flat again. There was not much change, because the gold market was also mediocre. By the afternoon close, there was no prosperity or decline compared to the previous day. Trading was light among the various banks. British gold was no more than tens of thousands of pounds, and the gold firms had a small number of receipts and payments. Hua Bank had mutual transactions, and US dollars were only three or four million dollars. The gold industry slightly clogged the forward prices and offset it with recent prices. Bank transactions were not deserted, and Citibank's buying appetite was still strong. Also, silver companies slightly sold forward prices. Under the trend of the market stabilizing, because it was Wednesday in the afternoon, there was usually no market.</p>
<p>The domestic market for British exchange fluctuated by only zero six two five in half a day. The recent selling price opened at one shilling, nine pence, zero six two five, the forward price at two-five, the buying price at one two five to three one two five. Wheat Company entered October one two five. Zhongfu came out with Shanghai one two five. Huabi came out in January two five. The afternoon close was the same as the morning market.</p>
<p>The domestic market for US exchange only fluctuated by one two five. The swap for this month and January was still three one two five. The selling price for this month was twenty yuan zero two five, November three one two five, December four three seven five, January five six two five. The buying price was three seven five to six eight five thousand closed flat. This month was still two five and January was five six two five. The buying price was increased by one two five. Sometimes, the zero six two five could also be used for those with each position. Also, the listed price of one yuan had been changed to three taels, three qian, four fen, seven two eight for full silver.</p>
<h3>Large Bars Near Long Zero Six Two Five</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, December 12th. Large bars were seen to return slightly. The closing price for recent prices was seventeen pence and three-quarters, the forward price was seventeen pence and eight one two five. Also, the British-American exchange rate opened at three yuan, four jiao, four fen, and three-eighths.</p>
<h3>Ocean Silver Rises Sharply, But There is a Reversion</h3>
<p>The market price of ocean silver has been rising sharply in recent days, like a mad horse galloping, unstoppable. In one week, it has risen sharply by several points, which is rare in the market history. This time, after the smooth sales to customers, the export of cash has been huge every day. Banks have also bravely bought a lot again, so the situation seems to have the right to rise again on the surface. However, observing the content, the scene yesterday afternoon was relatively slightly loose, or perhaps a drop of a few li is also not unexpected, but it ultimately belongs to the rising side, which can be decided in advance.</p>
<p>Ocean Li Rose Early, Fell at Noon, and Silver Lending Returned Weak. The "Ocean Li" market was very good in the morning, and the price of Li rose again to seven qian, one fen, four li, which was two li, one two five better than the previous afternoon. The bank's buying appetite was slightly sluggish in the afternoon market, and the supply from the industry was also very abundant, so it fell back by one li, calculated as seven qian, one fen, three li. The "silver lending" in the morning market and the afternoon market were both three fen, which was one fen smaller than the previous day. The head was added to water by four-five fen. The silver market situation was very stagnant. It was probably because the ocean li was raised and suppressed.</p>
<p>Corner Ocean was Raised, Copper Coins Flew Shrunken by Seven Thousand. The Jiangnan Little Ocean rose a total of seven li in the morning and afternoon markets, calculated as six qian, one fen, five li in the morning market and six qian, one fen, seven li in the afternoon market, and the trading situation was also more than usual, calculated as one thousand three hundred and fifty corners in the morning market and five thousand corners in the afternoon market. The Guangdong Little Ocean in the morning market was six qian, zero two li, eight hao, seven hu, half, and in the afternoon market it was six qian, zero one li, half. As a result, it also rose by one li and more, and the morning market traded one hundred and ten thousand corners and the afternoon market traded sixty thousand corners. Due to the relationship with the price of li, copper coins continued to shrink crazily. Yesterday, it continued to shrink by seven thousand wen, to only four hundred and fifteen thousand wen, and in less than a week it had shrunk by more than ten thousand. Trading then decreased, calculated as thirty-nine thousand and ten strings with a price of silver nine thousand four hundred taels.</p>
<p>Silver Ocean Enters and Exits, Silver is Stable, Ocean is Tighter. "Silver Funds." Although yesterday's bank collection and delivery news was slightly busier than usual, the Wang calculation was very prosperous. Chinese merchants collected and delivered drafts of over one million seven hundred and eighty thousand, foreign merchants collected and delivered drafts of over two million one hundred thousand, telegraphic transfers of fifty thousand, special funds of two million, advances of two million five hundred thousand, various goods, exchange taxes, and other funds collected and delivered over one million tens of thousands, collateral transactions of over one million three hundred thousand, eight hundred thousand entered the warehouse, four hundred thousand exited the warehouse, and money houses and silver companies collected and delivered over thirty-five million, and the head collection and delivery funds were over five million and ten thousand. Various route collection and delivery funds were over fifty thousand, and cash delivery was forty to fifty thousand. The "Ocean Funds" market traded a lot of opening exchange drafts every day, and yesterday was also not weak, with one million three hundred and thirty thousand in the morning market and one million one hundred and ninety-five thousand in the afternoon market. Banknotes were fifty-five thousand in the morning market and twenty-five thousand in the afternoon market. Outside the market, banknotes were one hundred and seventy-five thousand in the morning market and one hundred and five thousand in the afternoon market. Check transactions were fifty thousand in the morning market and thirty-five thousand in the afternoon market. Bank entry and exit trading was one million two hundred thousand in the morning market and one million one hundred and fifty thousand in the afternoon market. The various bank ocean accounts exchanged over one million seven hundred thousand, and the banknotes recovered and issued over two million four hundred and fifty thousand. Ocean collateral transactions were one million five hundred and sixty thousand. The customer routes went to Tianjin with sixty thousand, Xiamen with thirty thousand, Hankou with fifteen thousand, and the interior with twenty thousand. The various money houses and ocean public orders collected and delivered over seven million five hundred thousand.

<h3>Stable and Quiet Securities and Bond Market</h3>
<p>Transactions Totaled Two Million Three Hundred Thousand.</p>
<p>Yesterday (December 12th), the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market situation was extremely clear, with no market except for demobilization, which had transactions of one thousand yuan in the morning. Although many of the futures for the next month were opened, the market situation was calm due to the stagnant price. Both buyers and sellers were seen to be idle. It was calculated that there were more than one million three hundred thousand in the morning, but less than one million yuan in the afternoon, totaling two million three hundred and twenty-five thousand yuan. The market was calm, with only sporadic entry and exit. The demand and supply situation was very balanced. The prices were quite stagnant, and the fluctuations before and after the market were extremely small. Although it rose slightly compared to the previous day, the amount was only about three or four jiao. The bond market situation is feared to gradually turn calm.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Rebound is Strong</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: On Tuesday (the 11th), the New York stock market rebounded sharply due to improved sentiment towards outstanding orders of U.S. Steel Corporation. The next day (the 12th) was Columbus Day, and the New York Stock Exchange was closed as usual. Bears were uneasy and covered their positions, causing stock prices to soar. However, this rebound was a technical reaction, as mentioned in yesterday's report. Future developments cannot be determined based on this. The total trading volume for the day was 1.7 million shares. Closing prices of major stocks were as follows: U.S. Steel 49 (dollars), AT&amp;T 103, American Tobacco 71, Allied Chemical 35, Kodak 49.5, Electric Bond and Share 23, General Electric 15.5, Goodyear Tire 14, New York Central Railroad 21, Packard Motor 3, Standard Oil of New Jersey 9, Texaco 12, Union Pacific Railroad 6, United Aircraft 23, U.S. Steel 36.

<p>40 Bonds 79.40 Down 0.02</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Slackens Greatly in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market started calmly but continued its downward trend, which was very weak. Due to unfavorable conditions, there was warfare in both Sichuan and Shandong, further weakening confidence. Moreover, sellers were reportedly eager to deliver spot goods, adding to the pressure. Consequently, many small investors took profits, causing the market to decline further. Rongxing's long positions were also sold off. Spot yarn sales were even quieter. The lowest price this month was reportedly 145 taels.</p>
<p>The human-marked cotton market had poor conditions. In the morning session, the market opened with U.S. cotton trending higher, and sentiment was still calm. However, the current month was relatively slack, falling 8 cash, while distant months rose 12 cash. In the afternoon, the market weakened greatly, with each month falling 6 to 8 cash. The total trading volume for the day was 40,600 dan. Sales included Tongxing 1,300 bales, Rongxing 1,550 bales, and Dachang 650 bales. Purchases included Suilong 1,000 bales, Mingde 2,000 bales, Yichang 1,400 bales, and Zhenda 1,000 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Anqing 25, Guangdong 95, Ningbo 15, Xiamen 10, Mainland 100, Jiangxi 15, Shantou 20, Fujian 10, Fellow Traders 15, Luzhou 60.</p>
<h3>Weak Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning but fell in the afternoon. Although U.S. cotton rebounded by more than 10 points, local sentiment was quite weak due to continued selling by a certain manufacturer, increasing pressure. Moreover, favorable weather conditions in the country were conducive to the new crop. Due to poor yarn sales, factories were less inclined to purchase raw materials. Therefore, real demand in the market was quite limited, and the market was sluggish.</p>
<p>Near-term cotton fell 3.5 cash. The Zheng-marked cotton market opened in the morning with U.S. cotton slightly higher, and market sentiment was relatively strong. Each month rose 1.5 cash. In the afternoon, the market suddenly changed. Xinchenghao sold again in the near months, and prices fell further, reaching new lows. Each month fell 2.5 to 3.4 cash. The total trading volume for the day was 52,400 dan. Sales included Xincheng 2,100 dan, Renfeng 2,900 dan, and Changfeng 2,600 dan. Purchases included Suilong 4,700 dan, Gengfeng 5,300 dan, Mingde 2,500 dan, and Yuanda 2,400 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Total 1,126,100</p>
<p>Real demand was sluggish and unbearable. The sources of spot cotton were estimated to be 2,100 bales of Yao cotton and 800 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>American Seed Cotton 34.25. Dakang entered 100 pieces for factory delivery. Huoji Cotton 29.50, Yukang entered 500 bales for factory delivery.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Consistently Rose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was firm due to favorable news from Liverpool, frost, and buying by fellow traders. Futures rose 13 to 16 points, and spot prices rose 15 points. British cotton futures rose 5 to 7 points, and spot prices rose 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 5 points. Indian cotton market was closed.

<h3>Shanghai Yarn Inventory at the End of September</h3>
<p>According to investigations, as of the end of September, the total cotton yarn inventory of Chinese and Japanese mills in Shanghai was 84,055 bales, including 34,350 bales from Chinese mills and 49,705 bales from Japanese mills. The breakdown is listed below (unit: bales):</p>

<p>Total 34,350 49,705</p>
<h3>With Clear Skies, Rice Prices Fall More Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, approximately 40+ boats of domestic rice arrived in South Shanghai. Warehouse accumulation was abundant, sales were quiet, and sentiment was bearish. This was due to sufficient stocks of foreign rice, and Changzhou-Wuxi aged goods fell nearly a corner. Ordinary over-seasoned rice was neglected and discounted significantly. New japonica rice, Bai Ge kiln-fired, and Bai Dao rice were sparsely traded and fell by 2-3 corners. Foreign Du Jian rice saw no changes. The total volume of rice traded in the Huangpu River was approximately 1,000 stones.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flow of goods to Xinzha was still surging, but sales in urban and rural shops were sluggish. Top-quality new japonica rice from Changzhou and Jiangyin fell by 3-4 corners, similar to the South Shanghai market. Bai Dao rice from Qingpu, Songjiang, Fengjing, and Jiashan kilns saw a slight increase in incoming goods, but rural demand remained weak, and prices shortened by 2 corners. The arrival and sales of foreign Bu Jian rice were balanced, with a flat and weak trend. The sales of glutinous rice wine were weak, and the market was stable.</p>
<h3>Active Sales of Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>500 bags of Hunan rice newly arrived.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw a sudden increase in activity in the local market, and the sluggish market in recent days seemed to be reviving. However, prices continued to fall due to the influence of the Du rice merchants, who had a large supply of sharp-pointed rice. Compared to the sales at the end of last week, prices were smaller by nearly a corner. The overall market opened with more than 1,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice at a price of 9.05 to 9.10 yuan per bag, and 500 bags of Xiaojiao rice at a price of 7.70 to 6.50 yuan. They were all handled by local shops and scattered retailers.</p>
<p>Hunan rice had not arrived for a long time due to unprofitable transportation. Yesterday, 500 bags arrived. Because the cost in that area was already low, vendors made slight profits, but they had not been sold as of yesterday.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Plunges Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, after the midday opening, all months, near and far, plunged sharply. Although the news of the increase in foreign wheat was reported, the confirmed news that the U.S. wheat loan had been signed eight days ago and was scheduled to load in mid-November, totaling 150,000 tons of flour and 100,000 tons of wheat bran, would inevitably have a huge impact on the market in the future. Therefore, all major and minor factories were actively selling, and the market fell sharply and uncontrollably. The closing prices were down 1.75 points for the current month, down 2.75 points for November, down 2.5 points for December, down 2.5 points for January, down 2.25 points for February, and down 2 points for March.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Fall Step by Step</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market futures were affected by the U.S. wheat loan. Market participants were vigorously hedging, and both short and long positions were sold. Market prices fell step by step. In the afternoon, the weakness of the distant months was even more pronounced, because foreign wheat will arrive in the distant months, and hedgers are all paying attention to the distant months. The closing price was only down 2 points for March, down 5 points for next month, down 7 points for December, down 8 points for January, down 8 points for February, and down 7 points for March. 4,000 bags of spot wheat were opened, and were handled by Fufeng and other factories. The prices were 3.43 taels for Jiangbei wheat, 3.4 taels for Liuhe wheat, 3.47 taels for Wuhe wheat, 3.4 to 3.38 taels for Yangzhou wheat, and 3.45 taels for Yaowan wheat.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Changes from Weakness to Rise</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: On Tuesday (the 11th), Chicago wheat first fell due to selling from the East, then rose due to short covering. As a result, it rose 0.75 to 875 points compared to the previous day. The total trading volume on the 10th was 20 million bushels. The market prices on the 11th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>December 49.375 Up 0.750</p>
<p>May 54.500 Up 0.750</p>
<p>July 55.750 Up 0.875</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea European and American Silk Telegrams to Shanghai are Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firms' silk market was still lifeless. The European and American silk telegrams to Shanghai were still scarce. Sichuan and Shandong silk merchants, in view of the unstable situation, reported that the supply was blocked. Factory silk merchants had a negative attitude due to the constant labor strikes. Yesterday, only Liyijin bought 15 bales of Muji Yangfan silk, with 13-15 strings, at a price of 500 taels. Zhonghe bought 10 bales of Tonghe brand top-grade Chilibai silk at a price of 435 taels.</p>
<h3>Supply of Sichuan Silk is Blocked</h3>
<p>Political disputes have broken out between the two Lius in Sichuan Province, and warfare has already erupted. Shipping on Sichuanese boats is difficult, and the supply of Sichuan silk is blocked. Only postal packages are still being shipped to Shanghai, but they are limited to high-grade silk. As a result, lower-quality silk such as Sichuan scarves, tail silk, and wristbands are in short supply in Shanghai. Sichuan silk merchants stationed in Shanghai have all been cautiously selling.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Green Tea Sales are Sluggish and Prices are Low</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign firms' tea market has become increasingly bleak recently. The sales of Zhenmei tea, both from Luzhuang and Tuzhuang, have been particularly sluggish. The reason is actually due to the low-price competition from Japanese tea. Yesterday, Dunzhuang Zhenmei tea saw a small number of telegraphic transactions at Tongfu Foreign Firm, but the selling price fell another 4-5 taels. However, for the Gongxi item, Russia’s Co-op Association has not relaxed its intention to purchase. Baotouzhuang, in view of the gradual depletion of inventory in the market, has also been supplementing its deficits, although the selling price is extremely low, transactions are still not quiet.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil After the End of the Season</h3>
<p>After the Mid-Autumn Festival, Hongjiang tung oil had already passed its peak season. Now, at the time when it should be sold, it cannot develop because the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have suffered from famine for consecutive years, and the people can hardly maintain the basic necessities of life, let alone have extra money to engage in renovation. Moreover, after the war disaster in Shanghai, domestic finance has been affected, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and all industries are declining. Hongjiang oil relies only on domestic sales. Given the year, there is no way to develop. This is already recognized by the market. Fortunately, the various presses in the producing area are well aware of this situation and have reduced their production to avoid being shelved. This is also a fundamental solution. For this reason, although sales have plummeted, the supply is not comparable to previous years. Therefore, the accumulation in the market is not completely full, and the market does not have a tendency to collapse. It can only struggle to maintain the past in the midst of prolonged fatigue, which is also the appropriate distribution of production and consumption. Now the peak season has ended. If measured by previous years, there is still a tail end, but this year it disappeared long before the Mid-Autumn Festival, resulting in almost no market to speak of. Relying on the fact that the accumulation in various places is not thick, the existence or absence of the sales market is not in the mind. Although the market is tired, it can still stand steadily. The selling price in this port is based on Fupai Qingyuanfeng as the main market, and the remaining brands are increased or decreased according to the grade. In the future, there will be no sales, so it is estimated that there will be no honor or disgrace to be said.</p>
<h3>Coal Shanxi Coal Rebounds by Five Cash</h3>
<p>Shanxi white coal has fallen frequently in price due to the large number of incoming goods and the accumulation of stored coal. The price per ton has fallen from 19 taels in the spring to 14.5 taels. General fellow traders and shopkeepers competed to buy. Recently, there were not many incoming goods, and the inventory of coal felt scarce. Therefore, yesterday the market called for an opening price of 5 cash per ton, still selling for 15 taels.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Requests Implementation of Anti-Dumping Duties</h3>
<p>Also Plans to Formulate Raw Material Tax Rebate Measures</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce, due to the increasing economic invasion by foreigners, with Chinese merchants and factories suffering greatly from the dumping of foreign goods, almost to the point of being unable to survive, yesterday specifically petitioned the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to implement anti-dumping duties. At the same time, it also requested the formulation of raw material tax rebate measures to save Chinese merchants from their plight. The original text is recorded below: A petition regarding the matter of requesting. We believe that after years of war and famine in our country, production has declined and imports have increased year by year. Coupled with the global economic recession and the strict tariff barriers, many think of the Far East market as the final destination for their surplus goods. The state-owned industry of Soviet Russia, with its mass production, has a tendency to dump goods in countries around the world. Our country, as a country with a rudimentary industry, should pay even more attention. All these crises are too numerous to list. Although our country's tariff is called autonomous, the main market items are still bound by treaty mutual benefit agreements, and foreign merchants who come to set up factories in China benefit from our rich raw materials and cheap labor to produce goods and sell them locally, which is beyond the control of tariff policies. The dumping of imported goods and the rapid advancement of setting up factories locally complement each other, which is enough to make our country's industry lose its ability to compete and survive. The association is worried day and night and proposes two remedial measures: 1. For foreign goods that meet the conditions of Articles 2 and 6 of the Anti-Dumping Duty Regulations, the competent authority should review and propose anti-dumping duty rates and submit them to the Executive Yuan for implementation. At the same time, please also have your department consult with the relevant departments to quickly establish the Anti-Dumping Goods Review Committee to start the first step of the work. 2. Please, in accordance with the common practice of various countries, formulate raw material tax rebate measures for the import of manufactured products, in order to protect the rudimentary industry. In order to avoid foreigners setting up factories in China and also taking precedence, or using a tax rebate system and applying the name of a bonus, it is expected that excuses will be avoided. Is it appropriate? We hereby submit a document to your department for review and implementation. This is for the public good.</p>
<h3>Current Postal Locations in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Reliable news from the postal service: Ordinary and registered mail to Heihe, Aihun, Qike, Wuyun, Jinshan Town, Mohe, Suifenhe, Tongjiang, Dongning, Xiaosuifen, Mujiao Station, Xingyuan Town, Xiachengzi, Maqiaohe, Mujiao, Lishutown, Pingyang Town, Banzijie Hezi, Mishan, Hulin, Boli, Baoqing, Raohe, Fuyuan, and other places in the Jilin-Heilongjiang postal district can still be accepted and forwarded via Vladivostok.

<h3>All Sectors Actively Raise Funds for Northeast Refugees</h3>
<p>Telegram from Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce: Yesterday, Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and others jointly telegraphed Hong Kong merchants, requesting that they donate a percentage of their business profits to help Northeast refugees. Mr. Chen Lianbo, Chairman of Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong, is well aware that the people of the Northeast who have suffered are in dire need of relief in the cold weather. Merchants in Shanghai have initiated a campaign to donate a percentage of their business profits to help the relief effort. Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun companies are all donating 5% of their business profits for four days. Merchants in Hong Kong and Guangdong have always been charitable and righteous. We respectfully request that you quickly promote and encourage imitation. We are grateful and look forward to your telegraphic response. Xu Shiying, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhengting, Wang Yiting, Zheng Hongnian, Xiong Xiling, Wen Lantng, Huang Qinglan, Jie Yingguang, Guo Shun, et al. bowed. Seal.</p>
<p>Jiangwan Charity Horse Race: The United Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations for the Relief of Northeast Refugees, in view of the Northeast refugees who have suffered from both war and flood disasters, with hundreds of thousands of victims starving and freezing in the open air, which is unbearable to witness, has repeatedly convened meetings of all sectors to carry out relief measures. In addition to obtaining the consent of the three major companies in Shanghai, Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun, to donate 5% of their sales revenue within four days, they have also decided to hold charity horse races at the Jiangwan Racecourse on the 16th and 26th of this month by the Wan Guo, Yinxiang, and Jiangwan three associations, with all proceeds from ticket sales going to the relief fund. The Association has already sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, requesting that it show compassion for the disaster victims and exempt all these charity horse race tickets from taxes.</p>
<p>Three-Star Stage Night and Day Performances: Since the establishment of the United Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations for the Relief of Northeast Refugees, the Pushen Mountain Villa has been working hard to raise relief funds. Recently, due to the cold weather, the Northeast refugees are about to freeze and starve, and the relief is urgent. Therefore, we specially requested well-known figures in Shanghai and gentlemen from the Leshan Society to hold day and night performances at the One-Star Stage on Friday, October 21, to assist in the relief effort. All ticket proceeds will be used to relieve the Northeast refugees. It is heard that the stage owner Zhao Ruquan and Zhao Junyu and the performers are doing their best and will perform their best plays. In addition to ticket sales, there will be no fundraising in the venue. It is thought that benefactors from all walks of life in Shanghai will definitely come to watch in droves to enjoy the performance and support the good cause.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Negotiates Relocation of North Station</h3>
<p>McGon Road West to Become a Joint Transportation Station</p>
<p>Another Passenger Terminal to Be Built in Jiangwan</p>
<p>In order to revitalize Zhabei, the Municipal Government believes that the priority is to improve transportation. It has already decided to raise funds to widen the original roads and repair all damaged bridges and ditches to restore the original state. However, the North Railway Station, which separates Zhabei from the Public Concession, must be relocated first. Otherwise, transportation will be inconvenient and commerce will not develop. It has negotiated with the Ministry of Railways to move the station to the west of McGon Road to become a joint transportation station, and to build another passenger terminal in Jiangwan to meet the needs of the new city center area. Currently, the route from Baoshan Road to Datong Road will be completely demolished and rebuilt into a road. As for the steps of building the new station, the houses and tracks of the Jinghu Station east of Song Park Road will be demolished first, and a section west of that road will be used as a temporary station. After the Zhenru new joint transportation station is built, the west section will be demolished to complete the plan of moving the station and rebuilding the road. Regarding funding, according to the agreement between the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Railways, the cost of the new road within the scope of the original road land will be borne by the Railway Bureau. The construction and repair costs of the new and old roads outside the scope of the road land will be borne by the Municipal Government. However, the road construction plan and the required construction costs will be determined by the Municipal Government, and will be handled after both parties agree.</p>
<h3>Liaodong Volunteer Army Begs for Assistance</h3>
<p>Currently Surrounded by Japanese Army on Three Sides, Situation is Very Critical</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Local News: The Shanghai Office of the General Command of the Liaodong Volunteer Army received a telegram yesterday from Tang Jujuwu, Commander-in-Chief, and Huang Yuzhou, Commander, stating that they are currently under pressure from more than two divisions of the Japanese army and the situation is very critical. Our army is determined to fight to the death with the Japanese invaders with a spirit of great fearlessness. We hope that the rear will urgently appeal to all sectors for assistance. It is reported that the office has already sent letters to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, the Overseas Chinese Federation, the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Economic Committee, and various organizations to beg for assistance.</p>
<h3>Operational Situation of the Rehe Anti-Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Local Important News: Mr. Yan Bowen, a representative of the Rehe National Anti-Japanese Army, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. The reporter specifically went to his residence to inquire about the army's past situation. According to him, since the September 18th Incident, comrades such as Li Shiru and Li Haifeng have gathered old troops and contacted local militia to carry out activities in the Jin-Chao line area. More than half a year has passed since the fierce fighting with the Japanese imperialist army. Japanese planes have repeatedly bombed Chaoyang and nearby places, which was to bomb Li Shiru's and other troops. At that time, Chinese and foreign newspapers recorded this news. The Japanese invaders, under the pretext of the Ishimoto Incident, attacked the Rehe border several times. In fact, Ishimoto was a ronin, a spy of the puppet Manchurian government, colluding with opium and heroin dealers and unconscious bandits along the Liaoning-Rehe border, disrupting the rear of our Volunteer Army, resulting in the detention of Mr. Li Haifeng's troops. A month ago, Rehe comrades Zhang Zizhao and others telegraphed Mr. He Minhun, requesting that he go north to preside over and strengthen the anti-Japanese forces and unified command. Therefore, He went north in the middle of last month and consulted with the various Rehe anti-Japanese comrades to establish a military committee as the highest leading body of the Rehe Anti-Japanese Army. On the day before last month, a telegram was sent to compatriots at home and abroad, resolutely expressing the attitude of resisting Japan and fighting to the end. They will not stop their anti-Japanese actions until the lost territory in the Northeast is recovered. They will never ask about any domestic political issues. This time, Yan was sent as the representative stationed in Shanghai. His task is to enable compatriots at home and abroad to have a deeper understanding of the anti-Japanese significance of the army. According to him, among the anti-Japanese armies in the Northeast, some belong to the government and some belong to the people. Our Rehe National Anti-Japanese Army completely stands on the side of the people. We must understand the importance of Rehe's position today. If Rehe is not defended for a day, then there is no hope of recovering the Northeast, and Tianjin and Beijing will inevitably not be preserved. Therefore, to recover the Northeast, we must first preserve Rehe. In short, the importance of Rehe's position today is not only related to the entire Chinese revolution, but also Rehe has become a key point in the Second World War. Therefore, He went north to participate in the Rehe Anti-Japanese Military, and based his meaning on this. The situation of the Second World War is extremely urgent and can be said to have arrived at the eve. The comrades of our army can only shoulder the preliminary anti-Japanese mission of the Chinese revolution, and must fight to the end regardless of any difficult environment. As for the army's ammunition replenishment and rations, they are in dire straits. At this time, the cold weather in the border is approaching, and the soldiers fighting on the front line not only lack ammunition, but also suffer from the lack of cotton for warmth and hunger. We hope that compatriots at home and abroad will continue to provide assistance, but it is best not to provide cash assistance, but to provide ammunition and other military supplies. The various units of our army have now completed their assembly and have begun to seize the Jin-Chao line and launch a general attack on Jinzhou. There should be detailed war reports during the day.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei May Be Discharged from Hospital in Ten Days</h3>
<p>News from the Noel Hospital</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, is currently being treated at the Noel Hospital on Avenue Joffre for diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver, and has been granted a three-month leave of absence by the Central Political Committee for recuperation.

<h3>Wu Chaochu and Others Will Go North</h3>
<p>Visiting Suzhou and Wuxi, and Coming to Shanghai for Recuperation</p>
<p>Central Committee members Wu Chaochu and Chen Ce previously traveled to Suzhou and Wuxi with their families. Wu returned to Shanghai on National Day. According to Wu, he plans to recuperate in Shanghai for a week and then leave with Chen (Ce) and Ma Chaojun to inspect Beijing, Tianjin, and Ding County, for a period of one month before returning to Shanghai and going to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Bai Wenwei's Recommendations on Guiding the Huai River</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Bai Wenwei recently discussed the current plan for guiding the Huai River and made special recommendations, submitting them to Chairman Lin of the National Government to be forwarded to the Huai River Guidance Committee of the Ministry of Interior for joint discussion. The aim is to determine a major plan that truly benefits the people's livelihoods and to inform the governments of the four provinces of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui, as well as the people of the Huai River region.</p>
<p>The document states: "Water is inherently beneficial and harmless; going against its nature causes harm. The Huai River is located in the belly of China, carrying water from the four provinces of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui, and flows eastward into the sea, which is its natural course. Its benefits for transportation and irrigation are no less than those of the Yangtze River. However, Jiangsu, located downstream, has built embankments to block it. The Huai River originally flows eastward, but Jiangsu's embankments all run north-south, such as the Honghu Great Embankment, the Grand Canal East Embankment, and the Fan Gong Embankment, layer upon layer of obstructions, leaving the Huai River with no outlet. Furthermore, Haizhou in northern Jiangsu, which is the outlet for the Yishui River to the sea, has been dammed section by section for the purpose of transporting salt by water. The Yishui River flows eastward, but the embankments and dams of the Salt River all run north-south, so the Yi River has also stopped flowing.</p>
<p>In the past, Gun blocked the floods, and Yao executed him. However, Gun also followed the direction of the water and used embankments to contain it, but he never heard of blocking the flow and building dikes. Blocking the flow and building dikes is something that Gun would not dare to do, but Jiangsu Province, from north to south, has built barriers along hundreds of miles of the coast to block the Huai and Yi Rivers from reaching the sea. Is this not an extremely astonishing thing?</p>
<p>However, Jiangsu Province also has its reasons for building embankments to block the flow. Since the Southern Song Dynasty, the Yellow River has seized the Huai River, and the Huai River could not reach the sea, so it turned into the Yangtze River. The water level of the Yangtze River is high and cannot accommodate the Huai River, which has a tendency to head east to Lixia River and directly return to the sea. At that time, Lixia River was already a region rich in agricultural products, so they had no choice but to raise the Grand Canal embankment to block it. Subsequently, they had no choice but to build the Honghu Great Embankment to contain it. At that time, the Yellow River and the Huai River were merged, and the embankments, dams, and sluices were controlled properly, and they never stopped taking pride in the ingenuity of the engineering. But since the Honghu Embankment was completed, Sihong upstream has been successively submerged, and the Anhui northern plains fear the backflow of Hongze Lake, so they have built higher Huai River embankments. The Huai River is becoming heavier, and the water of the Anhui northern plains cannot enter the Huai River. The water of the Henan province plains also cannot flow smoothly into Anhui. The flow is stagnant, and the sand stops, accumulating for hundreds of years, and the ditches and river channels of the hundreds of thousands of square miles of plains of Henan and Anhui have all been filled into flat land. The well-irrigated fertile fields of the past are now thousands of miles of barren land, or boundless floods. Such is the current situation upstream.</p>
<p>Downstream, east of the Grand Canal embankment, the area known as the richest in agricultural products is now experiencing dry and depleted water, with the harm of salt tides flowing backward every year, and the harm of the Huai River flowing westward and causing breaches and floods. Last year, the breach at Gaoyou and Shaobo turned the Lixia River into a vast lake. This can be said to be the natural result of blocking the flow and building embankments, and it can also be said to be the beginning of the eastward migration of Hongze Lake.</p>
<p>The Yishui River in Haizhou, from the high ground in southern Shandong, has the momentum of a waterfall, but it is blocked by salt dams. The flow is stagnant, and the sand stops, so the Luoma Lake and Liutang Lake upstream are successively filled. To this day, when the water comes, it is flat and overflowing; when the water goes, it is dry and barren. The people of Haizhou still do not know that the salt dams are harmful and only seek to guide the Yi River. Such is the current situation downstream in Jiangsu Province. It can be seen that welcoming the flow and blocking it with dams may bring temporary benefits downstream, but the result will be that everyone suffers.</p>
<p>Since the Yellow River moved north in the fifth year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty, there was a great opportunity to restore the Huai River's access to the sea. However, the old channel, having been filled by the Yellow River for hundreds of years, was already higher than the surrounding plains, and the accumulated sand outside the mouth could not be removed. The work was difficult and costly, and discussions dragged on without success. In the first year of the Republic of China, Wenwei proposed reducing the army and guiding the Huai River, and engaged in investigation and surveying. He advocated changing the course to the lowlands of Haizhou and exiting to the sea from the Guan River estuary. At that time, he invited Cheng Dequan, the governor of Jiangsu, to jointly recommend Zhang Jian as the director of Huai River guidance, and the government approved. Zhang Jian then recommended Wenwei and Xu Dinglin as joint directors. They repeatedly discussed, and Zhang Jian reluctantly agreed, and issued the first declaration on Huai River guidance, which stated, in brief: "Guiding the Huai River should be done with 70% entering the sea and 30% entering the Yangtze River. Entering the sea should be done through the Guan River estuary, and entering the Yangtze River should be done through the Sanjiangying estuary. The estimated cost is 20 million yuan, and the time required is five to six years."</p>
<p>The following year, Zhang Jian became the director-general of the National Water Conservancy Bureau and ordered a loan of 30 million US dollars. He suddenly changed the plan of the previous year and advocated entering the sea through the abandoned Yellow River. After an American engineer came to China to survey, he determined that the abandoned Yellow River was absolutely unsuitable for the Huai River, and the loan failed. Zhang Jian returned south and re-selected the outline of the Huai River guidance plan, still advocating exiting the sea through the abandoned Yellow River, with a budget of over 99.9 million yuan for downstream construction costs. At that time, people in Jiangsu and Anhui expressed doubts about this engineering plan. American engineer Freeman said, "Like the Nantong Zhang family's plan, it cannot reduce the high water level upstream." If it costs hundreds of millions and still cannot reduce the high water level upstream, then it is clear that the abandoned Yellow River is not suitable. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>New Developments Yesterday in the Case of Recovering Extraterritorial Road Construction</h3>
<p>Fessenden Visited Yu Hongjun Again Yesterday to Continue Discussions</p>
<p>Agreement in Principle Reached on Draft Treaty and Amendments</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report stated that the long-delayed issue of recovering extraterritorial road construction has recently seen new developments. Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, visited Secretary-General Yu at the Municipal Government at 3:10 PM yesterday to continue discussions on this matter. The talks lasted until 3:40 PM. Fessenden then attended a meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors at approximately 5:00 PM to report on the results of his meeting with Secretary-General Yu. The directors then engaged in a detailed discussion of this matter.</p>
<p>Regarding the content of the meeting between Fessenden and Secretary-General Yu, Secretary-General Yu told a Central News Agency reporter that Fessenden had discussed two points during his visit. The first point was the two amendments requested by the Municipal Government, to which the Municipal Council had already agreed in principle, but the wording still needed to be modified. The second point was the principle of the Municipal Council's draft treaty for the recovery of extraterritorial road construction, to which the Municipal Council had already agreed, but there were still several points in the wording that it intended to modify slightly. In addition, the detailed measures for the trial implementation of the recovery of extraterritorial road construction were also discussed. It is currently planned that these detailed measures will be submitted to the relevant authorities for separate study.</p>

We eagerly await your response."</p>
<h3>Mourning the Postal Workers Who Sacrificed Themselves in the War of Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>Grand Memorial Service to Be Held in Shanghai on October 16</p>
<p>The National Postal Workers' Memorial Service for Postal Workers Who Sacrificed Themselves in the War of Resistance Against Japan is being actively prepared by the National Postal Workers' General Union. It is scheduled to be held at the Youth Propaganda Corps on the 16th of this month (Sunday). The general announcement of the conference and the deeds of the martyrs have already been printed into a separate booklet and sent to public groups and celebrities in all sectors of the party, government, and military nationwide. It is reported that the association has received many elegiac scrolls in recent days. Elegiac scrolls from Chairman Chiang, Minister Yu Feipeng, Minister Huang Shaoxiong, Mayor Wu, the Judicial Yuan, the Central Party Headquarters, and the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters have all been received. The association has also promulgated a unified memorial ceremony, notifying postal worker unions across the country to hold memorial services on the 16th and to add the inscription "Commemorate the Martyrs of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Vow to Recover the Lost Territories of Northeast China" to the mail.</p>
<h3>News on the Ministry of Industry's Steel Plant Plan</h3>
<p>No Suspension or Postponement of Contract Signing</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Regarding rumors that the Ministry of Industry's steel plant has been temporarily suspended or that the contract signing has been postponed, Huang Jintao, Director of the Mining Department of the Ministry of Industry, stated yesterday that the Ministry of Industry's Central Steel Plant plan has been completely negotiated. The funds have been designated by Finance Minister Song and accepted by the German merchants, so the formal contract is being drawn up. The rumors of suspension or postponement of contract signing are inaccurate. The reason why the formal contract has not yet been signed is that the draft is currently being prepared, and it contains many detailed items. In addition, communication between the Hopes Company and the German authorities takes time. However, the main conditions have been agreed upon by both parties. According to Chen of the Hopes Company, his statement is consistent with Huang's statement. Therefore, the steel plant, which is eagerly anticipated by the people, can be realized in the near future.</p>
<h3>Organizational Rules of the Postal Workers' Union: Shanghai Postal Workers' Union Requests Reconsideration</h3>
<p>Petitioning the Central Government for Approval to Reconsider</p>
<p>The Main Aim is to Maintain the Existing Organization</p>
<p>The organizational rules of the postal workers' union were promulgated by the Executive Yuan on the 5th of this month. After studying the rules, postal workers' unions in various places believed that the rules were difficult to implement, so they listed reasons based on facts and separately petitioned the Central Executive Committee and the Central People's Movement Committee for reconsideration, and requested the Executive Yuan to postpone implementation before the reconsideration and modification. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union's petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>"We are submitting this petition to request that the organizational rules of the postal workers' union are difficult to implement, and we are listing the reasons based on reality, urgently requesting your review and approval to submit them for reconsideration and modification, and to postpone the promulgation and implementation before the modification, in order to maintain postal operations.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Executive Yuan promulgated four organizational rules for postal workers' unions, etc., on October 5th. Except for roads, electricity, and aviation not being within the scope of the associations, after detailed examination of the articles of the organizational rules regarding postal workers' unions, there are many points that are difficult to implement. We are now presenting them to your organization.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the postal workers' unions in various places were established based on the union organization regulations first established by the Premier, and in accordance with the special union organization regulations promulgated by the 157th Central Standing Committee of the Second Central Committee, and the special union organization system promulgated by the 154th Standing Committee resolution. For more than eight years since their establishment, they have been conducting union affairs under the guidance of the party. The organizational members are mixed organizations of employees at all levels of the post office, and the preparatory committee for the National Postal Workers' General Union was established in the eighteenth year. All of this has been known to the party and government organs. Although the above-mentioned regulations were suddenly cancelled, the union affairs continued as before, and the guidance and supervision of the party and government organs also continued as before. The reason is that an organization established according to law, if it does not violate laws and regulations or disrupt order, there is no need to cancel or reorganize it. In the past, the request to promulgate special union laws was also to seek legal protection to consolidate its existing organization. The new organizational rules do not take consolidating the existing organization as the legislative basis, and Article 5 of the organizational rules stipulates that the organizational members are mail carriers, letter carriers, and postal assistants. Others, such as the most laborious coolies, miscellaneous workers, messenger boys, and the relatively wealthy old-system postal students and postal staff, are all excluded and excluded from the association, fundamentally destroying the existing organization. According to legal principles and based on facts, the organizational rules greatly violate your organization's good intentions to consolidate postal operations. This is one point in terms of the basic principles of the organization. The violation of facts in the provisions of the organizational members in Rule 5 is the biggest obstacle to the implementation of the rules. Regarding the members, the association suggests that the entire organization of postal workers at all levels is the highest principle, that is, all employees serving in the Chinese Postal Service are eligible to be union members, and at a minimum, the existing organizational members must be maintained. The reasons are:</p>
<p>A. The postal workers' union has always adopted a system of organizing all levels of postal workers. It started with the old-system postal students, and all the way down to the lower-level messengers were union members. After the postal students were changed to postal staff, the membership remained the same. Later, senior postal staff, with like-mindedness, were willing to join the local union as members. Therefore, the union's constitution stipulates that all citizens of the Republic of China who serve in various post offices within the scope of the association are eligible to be members of the association, which shows the intention of the association to unify the organization and eliminate class distinctions. The post office emphasizes division of labor, and although there are levels of employees, they are all workers. Therefore, it is a great violation of the good intention of the entire organization to restrict senior postal staff from being union members. If even the old-system postal students, who are superior in knowledge, courageous in revolution, loyal to the doctrine, and have always been the backbone of the union's leadership, are excluded from the association, it is not only unacceptable in terms of reason and sentiment, but also difficult to implement in practice, and it is greatly contrary to the central government's purpose of rectifying postal operations and promulgating laws and regulations. This is the second point.</p>
<p>B. The old-system postal students have superior knowledge and are rich in revolutionary spirit, so they are the backbone and leadership members of the union. They are all loyal to the doctrine of this party. In the past Northern Expedition and Purge, the union repeatedly made outstanding achievements, which shows that the leadership is effective. The central government not only does not cherish them, but instead excludes them, fearing that they will go astray and cause great harm to the party and the union members. This is contrary to the central government's legislative purpose. This is the second point.</p>
<p>C. The salary of the old-system postal students starts at 40 yuan, and the maximum is only 170 yuan. Currently, the salary of the old-system postal students is mostly between 40 yuan and 80 yuan. Those with more than 100 yuan account for only 1-2% of the total. Compared with ordinary letter carriers, whose maximum salary is about 90 yuan, and ordinary postal assistants, whose salary is about 130 yuan, they actually feel that they are inferior. This is in terms of the salary system. There should be no discrimination against the old-system postal students. This is the third point.</p>
<p>D. The work of the old-system postal students is exactly the same as that of the postal assistants. The post office also issues appointment letters, so there is no clear distinction in terms of position and responsibility. To allow this and exclude that in the regulations is inevitably depriving the people of their legitimate legal rights. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>The above four reasons show that the existing organization cannot be separated. The fact is very obvious. Otherwise, class struggle will grow with the implementation of the rules, and the future of postal operations is difficult to imagine. This is the second point regarding the organizational members that should be requested for re-provision.</p>
<p>The original rules regarding the organization of the National Postal Workers' General Union or Federation should be clearly stipulated in writing. The reasons are:</p>
<p>A. Article 45 of the Trade Union Law stipulates that unions of the same industry or occupation may organize a federation. The postal workers' unions in various places are all affiliated to the post office, and their service industries and natures are the same. According to law, there should be a national general organization.</p>
<p>B. The preparatory committee for the National Postal Workers' General Union was established on December 1, 1929, in accordance with the special union organization regulations promulgated by the 157th Central Standing Committee of the Second Central Committee and the special union organization system promulgated by the 154th Standing Committee resolution. Although the above-mentioned regulations were abolished in March 1930, the preparatory committee for the National Postal Workers' General Union was established first, and the organization according to law is still valid. In addition, requests have been repeatedly made to promulgate special union laws, and the National Assembly and the Central National Congress have accepted them for reference and forwarded them to the Central People's Movement Committee for handling. In July of this year, the Central People's Movement Committee approved the holding of a symposium of representatives of postal workers' unions from all over the country in the capital, and many resolutions were passed. If there is no national general organization, how will the resolutions of the conference be carried out? This is the second point in terms of historical evolution and factual needs, there should be a national general organization.</p>
<p>C. The post office is all over the country, and there are more than 30,000 workers. Without a national general organization, how can they be uniformly directed? This is the third point. This is the third point regarding the federation organization.</p>
<p>As for Article 13, which stipulates that the competent authority for the postal workers' union is the Ministry of Transportation and that the provincial, municipal, and county governments in the area where its branches are located are the supervisory organs, it should be supplemented, that is, the postal workers' unions in various places are subject to the guidance of the National Postal Workers' General Union, the management of the Ministry of Transportation, and the National Postal Workers' General Union should be subject to the guidance of the Central Party Headquarters and the jurisdiction of the National Government. This is to conform to the reality of party and government guidance and supervision and to prevent the risk of postal operations being neglected. This is the fourth point in terms of guidance and supervision.</p>
<p>Others, such as the provisions and restrictions on the directors and supervisors in Article 7, are deemed to be too strict. It is still requested that the current practice be followed, with 5 to 15 directors and 3 to 5 supervisors, and the proportion should be determined according to the number of members, so that it is possible to concentrate talents and promote union affairs.</p>
<p>The association believes that the special union law has not been promulgated for a long time, and it is deeply afraid that it will not be possible to follow it. Now, the organizational rules have been promulgated, and we admire the great kindness of your organization in maintaining the union movement. However, because the organizational rules still have many points that are difficult to implement in practice, we have ventured to present our humble opinions. Whether they are appropriate or not, we have prepared this document and requested your organization to review and accept them. We earnestly request your approval to submit them to the meeting for reconsideration in order to amend them, and we also request that you forward them to the Executive Yuan to postpone the implementation. We are awaiting orders with urgency.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to: The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, The People's Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang, The Executive Yuan.</p>

<h3>Messages on the Sichuan War</h3>
<p>Zhang Qun Sends Another Telegram to Sichuan Urging Cessation of Hostilities</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report stated that newspapers in this city yesterday reported that the Central Political Council had decided to mediate the Sichuan situation and that Central Committee members Song Ziwen and He Yingqin would consult to determine the candidates, and there were suggestions of Central Committee member Zhang Qun. A Central News Agency reporter went to Zhang's residence to inquire about this matter. According to Zhang, he originally intended to return to Sichuan in his personal capacity this spring to inspect and discuss plans to improve Sichuan affairs, but he was unable to make the trip due to personal matters. Now that he hears of internal strife in Sichuan, he feels that it is not impossible to make a trip for the sake of his hometown and the country, but it is difficult to travel far due to the accumulation of public and private affairs. Moreover, if there is no practical solution to the Sichuan affairs, it would be futile to engage in emotional mediation, and even if he went, he was afraid that it would not help. Yesterday, upon seeing the newspaper reports, he had already sent a letter to Nanjing explaining the whole story and pre-emptively declined. The reporter then asked whether there were any replies to the telegrams previously sent to the various generals in Sichuan. Zhang replied that there were replies, and their words did not want to be the leaders of the military, but the situation was becoming increasingly tense, so he sent another telegram yesterday to offer further advice. The telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Most urgent: To Chief Supervisor Fu Cheng of Chongqing, Chairman Liu Zigang of Chengdu, General Deng Jinkang, General Tian Songyao, General Yang Zihui of Guang'an.</p>
<p>The previous telegram expressed my sincerity. I am honored to have received your replies, and I respectfully observe your intentions not to lead the military, and we all share the admonition that good soldiers are ominous. In addition to disappointment, I am delighted to hear good news. I sincerely hope that we can adhere to this sincerity and be consistent with each other. For the past twenty years, Sichuan has experienced several wars, and the intention was to stabilize the Sichuan situation and complete unification, but the result has been division, with each ruling on their own. This shows that the Sichuan affairs cannot be resolved by force. Only by seeking a peaceful path in politics can we understand and concede to each other, neglect and live in peace with each other, and work together to overcome difficulties and plan for the long-term stability and security of the Southwest. Otherwise, grudges will deepen, knots will not be resolved, the people will suffer in dire straits, and the consequences of suffering will be dire, and the impact on the overall situation is even more worrying. The generals should be aware of the lessons of the past and not want to repeat the mistakes. On the one hand, we should listen to the central government to preside impartially, and on the other hand, we should negotiate openly and honestly with each other, and use political solutions to resolve disputes. We should not resort to arms and bring disaster to the future. I am heartbroken by the national crisis and eager for peace. As far as my limited strength allows, I dare not fail to do my best. Only the benevolent can love the people, only the wise can see the opportunity, and only the brave can achieve themselves. I respectfully express my innermost thoughts again, and I hope that you will consider them. Sincerely, your brother Zhang Qun."</p>
<p>Reports from Sichuan Generals</p>
<p>A Guo Wen News Agency report stated that generals Tang Shizun, Pan Wenhua, and Wang Zanxu of the 21st Army sent a telegram to the army's representative stationed in Shanghai reporting on the situation of the Sichuan war. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>"To Deng Mingjie, Fu Zhenwu, and Fan Chongshi:</p>
<p>Confidential. Since the conflict between the 24th Army and the various units of Yang, Li, and Luo in the border areas of Shunqing, Chi, and Peng'an counties, the situation has been very serious. For years, the various units of Yang, Li, and Luo have been induced and coerced by Liu Zigang, and their anger has been accumulating for a long time. Deng was deceived by him two years ago, saying that he would help him unify the internal affairs, resulting in the war in Shunqing and Sui'ning last year. As a result, Li and Luo were dispersed, and the two Chens were reorganized by Qian, and Deng lost land and troops for no reason, suffering in silence. He has been repeatedly seduced by Qian, and his troops should be on guard against each other in Chengdu. Yang also discovered evidence of Qian seducing his troops during their cordial relationship, resulting in the temporary removal of dozens of regimental and battalion commanders from his subordinates. Because of this, the various units are in danger, so they have risen up to unite in order to seek survival, which is inevitable. In addition, since recently, Qian has been raising funds in his defense zone in the name of national defense, amounting to more than 10 million. The people are opposed to it, and their appeals are beyond the ordinary. The various armies believe that Qian's move is based on swallowing the various units. Qian has lost credibility for a long time and does not know how to repent, and he is so cruel to the people. Therefore, there is today's change. Recently, Yang, Li, and Luo are not the only ones. Tian is preparing troops urgently, and Deng is ostensibly helping and borrowing things from the province in order to regain his old troops. This situation is so serious. The various units have suffered from Qian's deceit and often report to our army for assistance. We are aware of the situation, but we have no way to help. We are very sad. Qian is immoral, but he complains about our army and spreads propaganda and petitions in the Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan newspapers and to the government authorities, wanting to preemptively accuse us of destroying peace. Now that the facts are in Shunqing are all there, we are still trying to stop the war. Our pain is in the national crisis. Our desire for internal strife is not the same as those who fabricate facts for one-sided propaganda. The brothers are outside, and we hope that you will properly disclose this situation so that the people of the country will understand and not be blinded by those with more wealth and skill. Our army is still calmly mediating and doing our best to stop the war. We will listen to the government's orders. This is our current attitude. Although the situation in Sichuan is complex and long-standing, as mentioned above, how can empty words and boundless plans solve the problem? The government and the media have ignored it, and this is another sigh from those who know the situation that the country has no public opinion or right and wrong, so things are crowded with difficulties. Tang Shizun, Pan Wenhua, and Wang Zanxu."</p>
<p>Li Hongkun's telegram:</p>
<p>Omitted. Today, we received telegrams from various parties that the 24th Army had increased its troops. (1) Two regiments of Chu and Wang were added to Tongnan. (2) Yang Zongli's brigade arrived at Yaoshi Town, Chen Min's brigade arrived at Baizi Town, Chen Nengfen arrived at Anju Dam, Sun Xiansong arrived at Longtai Field, and You Guangju arrived at Xinqiao. (3) Li Yushu's brigade of three regiments and Yu Zhongying's regiment were added to Ruzu, and three brigades were transferred from Wu Jiapu, with more than 300 camels of ammunition and many artillery pieces. In Yongchuan, two regiments of Yang Shangzhou's brigade were added. In various trivial matters, our army is currently working hard to eliminate the Sichuan war and is sending personnel to dredge and relieve various parties. If the enemy comes to commit a crime, the troops that are now guarding the department and joining the department, work hard to avoid it and gradually retreat. Special report. 21st Army Chief of Staff Li Hongkun."</p>

<h3>Support Association for the Righteous Army Replies to Yang Yijie Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Support Association for the Northeast Volunteer Army received repeated letters requesting aid from Yang Yijie, representative of the Fourth Route of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, but there was no official document. That was considered not in accordance with procedure. After investigation, it was determined that the Righteous Army was indeed a unit organized by responsible persons in the Northeast. Therefore, a letter was sent to the representative again yesterday, stating: "Regarding your previous letter requesting assistance for your army, we replied on October 2nd. Because we had no way to send it, it was delayed for several days. Later, we received your letter of October 5th and learned that your representative had moved to the guest hall. We immediately ordered a servant to deliver the reply. We trust this has been noted. Your letter of the 5th has been discussed and resolved by the 59th Standing Council Meeting. It is confirmed that both the 10th Route and the 26th Route are units organized by the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and are now under the command of General Zhu Ziqiao. It is hoped that you will quickly contact General Zhu. If there is anything needed, General Zhu can request it for forwarding. We are replying to you accordingly. We hope you will take note. Respectfully addressed to Yang Yijie, representative of the Fourth Route of the Liaoning Volunteer Army."</p>

<h3>The Telephone Problem in the Area of Extended Roads is Expected to be Resolved Soon</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Central News Agency states that the Ministry of Transportation's Shanghai Telephone Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau, the Shanghai Telephone Company, and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement all felt that it was necessary to resolve the telephone problem in the area of extended roads as soon as possible. Therefore, they continued to meet on the previous day. Of the five new conditions proposed by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, four have been resolved. The issue of telephone installation rights in the area of extended roads in the northern district, which was the focus of the dispute between the two sides, has also been resolved satisfactorily through mutual understanding and compromise among the four parties. According to a person in charge speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the parties involved in this matter are currently submitting it to the higher authorities for approval, and it is expected to be fully resolved in the near future.</p>
<h3>Ceylon Will Set Up a Tea Promotion Bureau</h3>
<p>Annual Promotion Expenses Reach 2.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>China's Tea Industry Will Suffer a Major Blow Again</p>
<p>The local tea industry recently received news from Ceylon that Ceylon's tea sales to various countries have reached second place in the world. The annual export volume reaches 25,000 pounds, more than twice the export volume of China, with a value of 100 million rupees (each rupee is currently worth about 1.25 Shanghai silver dollars). It has become one of the island's most important industries. Since the economic panic in various countries in recent years, tea sales have been slightly affected. It is recently learned that the government and merchants plan to raise funds for even more extensive foreign promotion. Recently, its government formulated the Ceylon Tea Promotion Ordinance, which was passed at a meeting in June of last year and approved by the Governor last month, and will be promulgated and implemented soon. The main points of the law include: (1) In order to promote Ceylon tea abroad, a promotion bureau (The Ceylon Tea Promotion Board) is specifically established. (2) The necessary expenses will be covered by increasing the additional tax in the tea export tax, but it shall not exceed one rupee per hundred pounds. (3) A separate committee will be set up, composed of the Minister or Deputy Minister of Finance and Industry, as well as representatives from the Tea Planters Association, the Tea Merchants Association, and tea plantation owners. After the implementation of this plan, there will be 2.5 million yuan in expenses each year for foreign promotion. The sales of Chinese tea are even more unimaginable. I wonder if those in our country who care about tea are also considering how to handle the aftermath.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Schedule Farewell for Weng Zhaoyuan</h3>
<p>And Welcome Mrs. Muir and Chen Wulie, etc.</p>
<p>Weng Zhaoyuan, brigade commander of the 19th Route Army, was dispatched by Cai Tingkai, commander of the army, to the United States to comfort overseas Chinese and seek support for the army's resistance against Japan in Shanghai, and to represent the China Aviation Construction Association in contacting overseas countries to develop China's aviation plan. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and is preparing to set sail. The Support Association for the Northeast Volunteer Army, the Shanghai National Salvation Federation of Various Organizations, the National Federation of National Salvation Organizations, and the China Aviation Construction Association will hold a tea party at 3:00 PM on the 15th of this month at 15 Jessfield Road to bid him farewell. At the same time, they will welcome Mrs. Muir and overseas Chinese Chen Wulie, who came from Germany to comfort the 19th Route Army, and so on.</p>
<h3>Tax Authorities Urge Collection of Winter Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department previously received a petition from the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association requesting that the director of the license tax bureau be held accountable for threatening and imposing harsh taxes, and submitted evidence to deter greed. After receiving the petition, the Taxation Department stated that the director of the bureau did not engage in embezzlement and specifically issued an order to the association to inform them and urge them to pay the winter tobacco and alcohol license tax. It has been learned that the temporary regulations on tobacco and alcohol business license tax clearly stipulate that other shops that also sell tobacco and alcohol should pay four yuan per season for each, and retailers should pay two yuan per season for each. The tax amount at each level is summarized and published on the license so that merchants can easily understand. Now, after reviewing the 14 licenses submitted, the merchants have all opened shops and also sell tobacco and alcohol. Naturally, they should pay four yuan per season. There is no doubt about it. As for the claim that they previously paid two yuan per season, whether it is true or not, it was the former director of the branch bureau engaging in embezzlement and violating the regulations. How can this be used as a standard? The Ministry's previous approval to collect taxes in accordance with the old regulations refers to the tax rates being in accordance with the original Ministry regulations, and not being allowed to change or increase the collection. Since the branch bureau is collecting taxes in accordance with the Ministry regulations, it is a matter of course and cannot be referred to as an increased burden, let alone be regarded as a threat and harsh tax. Merchants are accustomed to long-standing practices, and once they are rectified, misunderstandings are inevitable. The association should understand the overall situation, study the Ministry regulations in detail, and explain them clearly to each shop, and not allow them to make excuses to be biased, or even resolve to send the winter license tax to the association to be donated by the association to the tax bureau in accordance with the amount, which would be suspected of overstepping its authority to collect taxes and sheltering non-compliance. In short, the Ministry presides over tax administration and upholds impartiality. It will not allow tax collectors to illegally increase collections, nor will it allow shops to make excuses to resist payment of the amount due. The 14 licenses are hereby returned with the document. You should forward them to the shops for their retention and notify those who have not paid the tax to not resist again, lest they incur penalties. Be sure to comply. This order.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the China Border Colonization Society</h3>
<p>The China Border Colonization Society at 203 Moore Road, Shanghai, after submitting an application for registration with the Ministry of Interior and being approved, was also approved for registration by the Municipal Bureau of Education on the 9th of last month. In addition to sending personnel to the border provinces for on-site investigations, it has also published a society journal, which has already been published in four issues. The content is gradually being improved and is quite rich. Currently, in order to concentrate talent, the society plans to recruit more basic members and ordinary members (bylaws are on file). It is reported that those with specialized talents at home and abroad who are interested in border affairs and willing to become basic members are especially welcome. The society's published Border Colonization Monthly has been published in four issues, and the fifth issue has also been sent to print. Those who love to read border area publications can go to purchase them.</p>
<h3>Fresh Pig Industry Protests Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fresh Pig Industry Association received a joint letter from the Taixing County Pig Industry Association in Jiangbei and pig industry representatives Cai Xiqing from Nantong, Wang Ronghu from Rugao, Song Shigu from Jingjiang, He Banglun from Taixing, and Gao Renyao from Dongtai, stating that because the business tax bureaus of Taixing and other counties in Jiangbei have rented civilian houses in various ports along the river to establish official offices specifically to collect business tax on pigs passing through, estimating the value of each pig at twenty yuan and charging two jiao in tax, which harms merchants and people, they have repeatedly protested by telegram. The letter states that since the pain is shared, they should respond in kind and strive to protest and temporarily provide support. Therefore, the association specially convened an extraordinary meeting and decided to unite all its forces to actively protest until the goal is achieved.</p>
<h3>Brewing Industry Conditions Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>General Wage Increase of Six Jiao Per Month Per Person</p>
<p>All the workers in the Shanghai brewing industry demanded improved treatment and proposed conditions. After self-negotiations were ineffective, and repeated mediation by Party and government organs also failed to fully resolve the issue, yesterday the Social Affairs Bureau sent mediator Tan Peiyan, and the Municipal Party Department sent cadre Li Weixiong, to try again to mediate. They succeeded in getting labor representatives Wang Bingkui and Shen Guomin, and management representatives Zhu Qingtang and Fang Zhongheng, to agree to sign and resolve the issue. The original text is recorded as follows: (1) The management will increase the salary of each worker by six jiao per month. (2) In the future, labor and management should cooperate with each other. If there are any disputes that cannot be resolved by both parties, they should be submitted to the higher authorities for handling. (3) All parties will receive the same treatment, in accordance with past practice.</p>
<h3>Luo Jingyou Transferred to Anhui for Service</h3>
<p>Luo Jingyou, chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Government, recently received an order from the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, appointing him as the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Seventh District of Anhui Province and concurrently as the County Magistrate of Fuyang. Therefore, he submitted a request to Mayor Wu to resign from his various positions in the Municipal Government. Mayor Wu repeatedly tried to persuade Luo to stay, as he had made many achievements while in office, but Luo insisted on resigning and was approved. As Luo was repeatedly urged by the General Headquarters, he is scheduled to depart for Hankou tonight to receive instructions, and then go to his new post. Mayor Wu and Secretary-General Yu held banquets yesterday to bid him farewell. Colleagues in the Municipal Government are also scheduled to hold a farewell party at the Nanjing Hotel today and present him with a large silver tripod as a souvenir.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at the Chinese Electric Company Reaches Impasse in Negotiations</h3>
<p>Company Board of Directors Resolves to Punish Perpetrators</p>
<p>Refuses Any Demands Until Objectives Are Met</p>
<p>Workers' Mass Meeting Prevented Last Night</p>
<p>The Chinese Electric Company held a board of directors meeting yesterday to address the labor dispute. It was resolved that any negotiations would be completely rejected until the perpetrators were punished, resulting in the failure of direct negotiations yesterday. The Municipal Government ordered the Public Security Bureau to prevent the workers' mass meeting last night. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Company Board Meeting The board of directors of the Chinese Electric Company held a meeting at 2 PM the day before yesterday. All directors, including Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, and manager Lu Bohong, were present. The manager first reported on the workers' demands for National Day wages, the assault on Secretary Feng, and the mediation efforts of party and government organs. The discussion then began. It was noted that Secretary Feng's injury was purely work-related and based on the joint announcement of the government and party headquarters. The workers' actions were clearly a violation of the law. It was resolved that (1) although Secretary Feng did not wish to pursue the matter, the company, for business reasons, should petition the government to strictly arrest the perpetrators; (2) any demands from the workers should be suspended until the perpetrators are brought to justice; and (3) condolences should be extended to Secretary Feng.</p>
<p>Negotiations Failed Yesterday Yesterday, the Chinese Electric trams on various roads in the Nanshi area were covered with slogans, such as "Support representatives in negotiations with the company," "Demand the same treatment as staff," and "Demand equal treatment for all." Worker representatives Wang Qingyi and others, based on Article 1 of the resolution determined by party and government organs, directly negotiated with the company's responsible representatives at 1 PM yesterday on issues such as wage increases. However, due to the board of directors' resolution to reject negotiations, no agreement was reached.</p>
<p>Mass Meeting Prevented The Municipal Government received a report yesterday that workers of the Chinese Electric Company planned to hold a mass meeting at 10 PM yesterday. Given the current martial law period and the fact that the workers' gathering had not been approved by party and government organs, the Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to strictly prevent it. It is reported that Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen ordered the police brigade and the Second District Police Station to dispatch police to dissuade the meeting.</p>
<p>Letter from the Union Correcting the Record The Shanghai First District Water and Electricity Industry Workers' Union sent a letter stating: "Dear Editor, upon reading your newspaper's report on the labor dispute at the Shanghai Chinese Electric Company, we find that the facts are completely inaccurate. We now provide a detailed account of the actual situation: Since July, union members have requested the company to increase wages according to the standard wage increase for workers, but the company has shown no sincerity in accepting this request and has used the excuse of the war's impact to completely refuse the request. This has led to months of accumulated anger among the workers. Regarding the issue of stopping work on Double Ten Day, on October 8, representatives from the tram depot requested union committee members to go to the company to negotiate. Secretary Feng Liutang appeared to explain that due to legal reasons, the request could not be complied with. At that time, union representatives Fu Chongde and others accepted Secretary Feng Liutang's promise to relay to the board of directors the request for supplementary pay for May 1st and the demand for the company to provide equal treatment according to the standard wage increase for workers. They were satisfied and left. Later, on October 10, tram depot workers learned that the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant, Gaochangmiao Shipyard, and Hexing Plant had all stopped work. They were extremely angry and took independent action, going to the board of directors' office to negotiate with Secretary Feng. However, Feng Liutang made unacceptable remarks, publicly insulting the workers, which immediately led to a conflict, resulting in slight injuries to Feng Liutang. Fortunately, union committee members Fu Chongde, Zhao Sanyuan, Zhang Zhendong, and others arrived upon hearing the news and worked hard to persuade the workers, and the situation was calmed. In summary, regarding all the above situations, we hope you will correct the record according to this letter. Sincerely, to the editor of Shen Bao."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shangnan and Shangchuan long-distance bus companies sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Construction Department stating: "To Director of the Zhenjiang Construction Department: Regarding the temporary measures for auditing long-distance bus tickets, the measures stipulated by your department to understand the operating conditions of various companies are already extremely detailed. Ticket stamping is particularly obstructive. We sincerely request that the department temporarily suspend implementation to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. Sincerely, Mu Shu, Shangnan Bus Company; Gu Bowei, Shangchuan Transportation Company."</p>
<h3>Aftermath of the Textual Dispute Between Muslims and the Nanhua Monthly Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>Petition to the Executive Yuan to Severely Punish Editor Zeng Zhongming</p>
<p>The Nanhua Literary Semi-Monthly previously caused controversy due to the publication of texts insulting Muslims. Although the matter had been settled after the journal's authorities accepted the four demands put forward by local Muslims, the Nanhua side has delayed publishing the articles submitted by Muslims, leading to further dissatisfaction among Muslims. At the same time, Muslims in North China also expressed objections. It has been decided to draft a petition to the Executive Yuan requesting that the journal's editor be punished. The petition has now been sent out on behalf of the Muslims in North China by their representatives stationed in Shanghai. The original text is as follows: "Presenting [this petition] due to extraordinary insult and overwhelming grief, appealing for strict punishment according to law to prevent trouble from arising and to comply with public sentiment. Islam has been introduced to China for more than a thousand years, coexisting peacefully with Confucianism, Buddhism, and other religions. The country has never rejected it, and the people have never discriminated against it. This is because the tenets of Islam are all reasonable and contain no secret or clandestine points. The only difference from other religions is the prohibition of eating pork. This is because diet is a source of nutrition and affects one's temperament. People generally only pay attention to hygiene in their diet, but Muslims emphasize both hygiene and moral character. Therefore, their choices are particularly strict. Pigs are filthy and lazy creatures, and their meat contains the most germs among animals. The reasons for Islam's prohibition of eating pork are detailed in the 'Tianfang Dianli' [Islamic Rites] and are the same as the prohibition of alcohol because it can intoxicate. Moreover, having dietary restrictions is common to all religions. Confucius distinguished between colors and smells, Buddhist and Taoist monks do not eat meat, and Jews prohibit eating pork and dog meat. Those who are slightly knowledgeable and aware of world customs can generally understand this. Unexpectedly, the 'Nanhua Wenyi' [Southern China Literature], edited by Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, contained texts that extraordinarily insulted Islam. The 14th issue of the first volume of the journal contained an article titled 'How Muslims Don't Eat Pork,' which attached base and absurd elements from the 'Journey to the West' novel, fabricating wildly, criticizing recklessly, and directly regarding the 50 million Muslims as aliens, wanting to exclude them from the human race. Upon reading it, we cannot help but be shocked and indignant. Since the founding of the Republic of China, Muslims have always supported the Kuomintang. During the Xinhai Revolution, Muslims from Shaanxi and Gansu were the first to start the uprising, and the 'Five Races' were created. However, Mongolia and Tibet have successively seceded, and Manchuria has relied on foreign powers to establish a puppet state. Only our Muslim people have supported the Party and the country consistently. Many Muslims served as vanguards in the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army. At a time when the country is facing great difficulties, how should we unite sincerely to resist foreign aggression? However, Zeng Zhongming, a key official in the central government, instead of thinking about serving the country wholeheartedly, is using the journal to abandon the Muslim people. We do not know what his intentions are. In recent years, in the Northwest provinces, misunderstandings between Muslims and Han people have often led to disputes. The state has been sending officials to appease and mediate. How can we provoke further discord? If the journal is disseminated everywhere and those who are not Muslims and lack common sense arbitrarily ridicule [Muslims] based on the article, Muslims may be provoked to anger and even lead to riots. What will be the consequences? Britain's experience in India over the years ultimately led to the failure of unification due to discord between Muslims and Hindus, which should be taken as a warning by those who plan for the country. Zeng Zhongming is a key figure in the Party and the country, and his knowledge should be exceptionally superior, far from being comparable to a village school teacher. Now, he has included vulgar literature in the journal, which clearly indicates ulterior motives. Zeng Zhongming, as the editor-in-chief, is responsible for selecting and approving the contents, and he cannot deny knowledge of this. If the wise government of China does not consider the 50 million Muslims as citizens, then so be it. If it still considers the 50 million Muslims as citizens, then it should punish the editor-in-chief with appropriate punishment to redress the grievances of Muslims. Therefore, we appeal to the Executive Yuan to issue an order to dismiss Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, and hand him over to the court to be charged with the crime of sowing discord among ethnic groups and endangering the country. Furthermore, issue orders to the Capital Police Department and the Shanghai Municipal Government to order the 'Nanhua Wenyi' to cease publication immediately. The author Lou Zikuang fabricated falsehoods and publicly insulted [Muslims], and his crime is even more serious. He is currently hiding in Hangzhou. We request that the Zhejiang Provincial Government immediately arrest him and hand him over to the court to be punished according to law. All the above reasons, including redressing grievances and urgently seeking strict punishment according to law, are presented in this petition. We respectfully request the Executive Yuan to review and implement it. We are extremely apprehensive and pray for your consideration. Respectfully presented to the Executive Yuan of the National Government by all Muslims in North China."</p>
<h3>Special Zone and Caohejing Prisons Seek Donations of Clothing and Bedding for Prisoners</h3>
<p>The Second Special Zone Prison and the Caohejing Prison in this city are now soliciting donations from all sides for winter clothing and bedding for the prisoners, as winter is approaching and the prisoners are isolated in iron cages, unable to withstand the cold. The prisoners in prison only wear a prison uniform and have no other items to keep them warm. They also have nothing to cover themselves at night when they go to sleep, which is quite miserable. Every winter, some prisoners fight with each other over a blanket, which is very pitiful. There are now more than 2,000 prisoners in Caohejing Prison and 1,000 to 2,000 in the Second Special Zone Prison, requiring a total of about 4,000 sets of clothing and bedding. Donations can be sent to the prison.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Speech at the International Friendship Luncheon</h3>
<p>Hoping for a Spirit of Friendly Mutual Assistance</p>
<p>Applying Its Effectiveness to Facts</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM yesterday, the United Nations Association held an international friendship luncheon at its club and invited Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng to speak at the meeting. Mayor Wu's speech was brief, saying, "I am very pleased to be invited to this banquet by your association. Today's banquet is slightly different from ordinary banquets. Today's banquet actually contains the deep meaning of promoting friendship between China and foreign countries. Therefore, I would like to contribute sincere and enthusiastic friendship to you, and I firmly believe that you will respond with the same friendship. I hope that this sincere and enthusiastic friendship will not only be expressed in a spirit of friendship, but should also be applied to facts. There is an ancient Chinese saying that 'when two people are of one mind, their strength can break gold.' Although there is no clear saying about the combination of more than three people, if people from all countries present here work together to accomplish great things, I dare to say that its effect will exceed our imagination. There is no doubt that the Republic of China will become the center of the world's commercial market. However, it is impossible to realize this without sincere cooperation. If we have thorough understanding and sincere cooperation, our country's inexhaustible treasures can</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>be developed, and we can all benefit from each other. Wouldn't that be great? Unfortunately, a few people are blinded by suspicion and tempted by greed, so that this good possibility cannot be realized, and it gradually forms a general economic oppression, causing suffering to the whole world. However, we must not be complacent with this economic oppression for a single day, but should strive together to achieve understanding and cooperation, be sincere and loyal, and unite to promote the realization of the central force of cooperation with our existing shares. We should not shirk our responsibility and make our example of cooperation sufficient to show the world, so that the world will know the value of friendship and cooperation. Therefore, I suggest that we first form a common public opinion on these few aspects to enhance the spirit of friendly mutual assistance and make it a reality. Thank you for your kindness, and I wish you success."</p>

<p>Dahua Real Estate Opens New Roads The property at the original site of the Dahua Hotel is now managed by Puyi Real Estate Company, which is opening two new roads. One road from north to south is proposed to be named "Dahua" Road (Majestic Road).

<p>Cessation of Construction of Xidingxing Road The Public Works Department originally planned to open a new road between Chengdu Road and Datong Road, in a densely populated area, to facilitate police and fire services, and proposed to name it Xidingxing Road. The cost of land acquisition would be 100,000 taels. In order to save expenses, it is proposed to remove this item from the road plan for next year. Furthermore, previously, for the purpose of building this road, four fen and nine hao of land had been purchased there. The original owner still wants to buy it back at the original price plus 6% compound interest for seven years. This proposal has been approved by the board of directors.</p>

The fire destroyed more than ten houses. Gang police from the 4th District Public Security Bureau detained fire starters Zhong Guilin and Xie Wanbao for investigation.</p>
<h3>Another Shantytown Fire in Zhabei Last Night</h3>
<p>One Boy Burned to Death</p>
<p>The shantytowns on the west side of Kangjili, at the intersection of Jinling Road and Minli Road in Zhabei, are densely packed, with more than a thousand rooms, mostly inhabited by poor people from Jiangbei. At 9:35 PM last night, a fire broke out suddenly in shanty numbers 1 and 2. Due to the dry weather in recent days and the fact that the shanties are easily flammable, the fire spread rapidly, with red light soaring into the sky. Forty to fifty shanties were burned down. A child, Chen Changfu, ten years old, was unable to escape in time and died in the fire, his head and face charred beyond recognition. When the fire broke out, Tong Daosheng from Xuzhou, who lived in shanty number 27, witnessed the fire starting in shanty numbers 1 and 2 and immediately alerted the gang police, who frantically blew whistles. The fire brigade arrived and extinguished the fire. After a charred corpse was recovered, it was abandoned on the roadside.

<h3>Arrest of Xia Qin for Allegedly Impersonating an Official</h3>
<p>Wen Hongen, Chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, yesterday urgently received a message from the Capital Police Department stating that Xia Qin (alias Zheng Hao), chairman of the Xiamen Datong Daily and general manager of the Jinghan National Daily, had recently impersonated Wu Siyu, chief of the Capital Police Department, in Shanghai, and shown a gentleman his own business card, on which he had personally written "Please Mr. [So-and-so] ask Chief Wu to discuss important matters, please grant an audience."

After receiving the message, Chief Wen ordered the chiefs of various districts and Lu Ying, the chief of the detective team, to arrest Xia Qin.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Committee for the Chicago Exposition Appoints Special Commissioner for Fujian Province</h3>
<p>The Chinese government has organized a preparatory committee to participate in the Chicago Exposition to be held next June and is responsible for its affairs. It is learned that the committee has specially appointed Mr. Dong Kunfan, vice chairman of the Fujian Huier Orphanage, as the special commissioner for the collection of goods in Fujian Province. Lacquerware is the best special product of Fujian Province. It won a special award at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in the United States, but lacquer merchants generally do not improve their products, leading to the decline of this handicraft industry, which is a pity. The Huier Orphanage workshop has a lacquer department. When the Chinese Vocational Education Association held a vocational education discussion meeting in Fujian, there was a provincial vocational education exhibition. The orphanage's lacquerware and other products won the championship at the exhibition. Mr. Jiang Hengyuan commented that "Only by improving old occupations and creating new occupations can we fulfill the mission of vocational education. The Huier Orphanage's approach is quite close to this and is truly one of the leading vocational education institutions in China." It is recently learned that the orphanage's workshop has produced new lacquer products and intends to participate in the Chicago Exposition.</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Falsely Labeled as American Goods All Destroyed by Customs</h3>
<p>Stancombe Hair Cream, manufactured by the American company William Warner, has been sold for many years. In November of the year before last, a Japanese merchant who opened a Western-style company falsely claimed that it was that brand and shipped it to China for sale. The first batch consisted of ten large boxes, which were shipped from Nagasaki to Shanghai. When they arrived, the customs authorities discovered the deception, and immediately detained the goods. Mr. Klein, the manager of William Warner, filed a lawsuit according to law, requesting appropriate compensation and the complete destruction of the goods to avoid disrupting his business, and that such counterfeit goods should never be discovered again. The results were all approved. Then, the customs inspector, the company's manager, and dozens of business representatives burned the counterfeit goods in public.</p>
<h3>Traveler Smoking Opium and Tea Room Selling Opium at the Far Eastern Hotel</h3>
<p>Sentenced Separately and Granted Suspended Sentences</p>
<p>West Detective Mei Sheng Hua and Sergeant Xu Shuren of the Old Zhabei Police Station, patrolled various hotels the night before last to see if there were any bandits or undesirable elements hiding there. At 10:40 PM, they went to Room 309 of the Far Eastern Hotel on Xizang Road and found several people lying on the bed, inhaling opium and smoking. They immediately arrested five people: Hu Ruigen from Wuxi, Xu Zhuqing, Wang Wenru, Xu Ziming, and Mao Jiafu from Ningbo. They confiscated two opium pipes, one and a half opium lamps, half an ounce of opium, and found fifteen ounces of raw opium, fifteen ounces of opium residue, and seven and a half qian of opium paste in the room. After investigation, it was discovered that the opium belonged to Jin Linfu from Wuxi and Shi Zhaoyin from Ningbo, who worked in the tea room and specialized in selling it to travelers. The police arrested Jin and Shi and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court, Criminal Division One. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, charged Jin and Shi with selling opium in violation of Article 6 of the Opium Prohibition Law, and charged Hu and the other five with smoking opium in violation of Article 1 of the Opium Prohibition Law. After the presiding judge, Qian Hongye, heard the case, he announced the judgment in court: Jin Linfu was sentenced to six months imprisonment with a three-year suspended sentence; Xu Zhuqing and Wang Wenru were each sentenced to one month imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence; the rest were found not guilty. All confiscated items were ordered to be confiscated. Lawyer Ru of the police station requested a period for appeal, which Judge Qian approved, ordering them to post bail. He instructed Jin and Shi to each post 300 yuan bail during the appeal period.</p>

They confiscated more than 3,000 counterfeit champagne tickets. It was discovered that the counterfeit tickets were printed by the Aiguo Printing House at 7 Xiamen Road, so they also took the owner of the printing house, Zhou Xueshou from Haimen, and his partners Qin Jiaqiu from Kunshan and Ma Baogen from Baoshan, to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Criminal Judge Feng Shide opened the court for continued interrogation. Because the evidence had been clearly investigated, he ordered the start of the debate. After a mutual debate between the police lawyer Ru Baoyi and the defendant's lawyer Fan Gang, Judge Feng announced the judgment in court: Qian Genshou, Zou Fugeng, and Zhou Xueshou were each sentenced to six months imprisonment, and Ma Baogen was sentenced to two months imprisonment. The number of days detained before the final judgment will be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days. The counterfeit champagne tickets were confiscated. Qin Jiaqiu was found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Record of a Pair of Men and Women Who Died for Love</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, Double Tenth Day, at around 3:00 PM, a young man and woman went to the Great China Hotel and booked Room 501, registering the man's name as Zhao Wenlong and the woman as Zhao Yuying. Afterwards, they both committed suicide by taking poison, etc. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the man was from Kunshan, 22 years old, and worked as a clerk in an advertising department on Hualong Road in the French Concession. He lost his parents at a young age, and both of his older sisters were married. He had been married but his wife died of illness last year, leaving behind a five-year-old son, who is currently living with relatives. The woman's original name was Su Fengying, 18 years old, and she was a prostitute at 42 Qinghefang on Zhejiang Road. Several months ago, after meeting Zhao, the two fell in love and planned to live together for the rest of their lives. Unexpectedly, things did not go smoothly, and the madam interfered, preventing their wishes from being fulfilled. Feeling disillusioned, the two decided to commit suicide together by swallowing opium. They left behind three letters, two of which described their brief lives, and one insulted the woman's biological mother, which included a note with the words "Gao's car repair shop, North Changjie, South Gate, Wuxi" for collection. There were also two savings account books from Jin Cheng Bank and Shanghai Commercial Bank, two checks, two rings, and a woman's purse, etc. Afterwards, the Old Zhabei Police Station received a report and ordered detectives to investigate. They carried the two bodies to the Feilun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Local Court and commissioned Prosecutor Zhan Liangce, along with forensic doctor Wang Zuyi and others, to go to the morgue to examine the bodies. After confirming the identities of the bodies, they ascended the court case and interrogated Yu Zhenting, who stated that he was a tea server at the Great China Hotel. After the two came to book the room that day, they went out together. They returned to bed about two hours later, and wrote a note to him, asking him to wake them up at 11:30 AM the next morning. When he went to call them at that time, the door was tightly closed and no one answered when he knocked. He and others realized that something was wrong, and climbed in through the window, where they saw the two already lying in the room, etc. Du Qianji and Lu Zonghai also testified that the deceased Zhao Wenlong was the wife's younger brother of them. They lived in Kunshan and learned the news through a report. His family now has only a five-year-old child, so they requested that the body be handed over to them for burial, etc. Prosecutor Zhan said, after examining the deceased Zhao Wenlong, male, and Su Fengying, female, it was confirmed that they had taken poison before death. Zhao Wenlong's body was handed over to Du Qianji and Lu Zonghai to collect for burial. Su Fengying was temporarily handed over to the Pushan Villa for storage. The bank savings accounts and checks, etc., were handed over to Du Qianji. The rest of the items were taken to the court warehouse for collection.</p>

Yesterday, the county magistrate sent Examiner He to interrogate them. First, the plaintiff female students Zhang Wenxia, ​​Lu Qihua, Zhu Rong, and Zhang Yiqin testified about the robbery. Then, Zhang Jiansheng testified: "I often hung out with Zhu Axiao. That day, I met Wang Linsheng at Zhu's place. He said that it would be easy for us to go to the normal school to rob things, so we did it that night." Zhu Axiao testified: "Although I went with them, I only kept watch outside and did not go in." Wang Linsheng confessed to going to the school with Zhu Axiao, Zhang Jiansheng, and others, and robbing five trunks, etc. The suspect Li Pintang did not admit to the robbery. After Examiner He verified the confessions, he sentenced Zhu Axiao and Zhang Jiansheng to one year imprisonment each for jointly stealing as a gang of three or more people.

<p>Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective of the Narcotics Division of the General Police Department, and detective Chen Yaoting learned that someone had opened an opium den at No. 461 Hengyuan Lane, Tianjin Road.

At around 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, they secretly searched the premises with West Detective Bai Po and others, and arrested Liu Kaifu from Yangzhou, Xia Youliang, Kan Guangjin, Zhang Wenhua from Nanjing, and seized seventy ounces and three qian of Yunnan opium, seven account books, and one seal. They took them all back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court, Criminal Division One. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the case, charging each defendant with selling opium in violation of Article 6 of the Opium Prohibition Law, and stating that the defendant Xia Youliang had also been arrested for carrying opium two years ago. It was discovered that Xia had used bribery at that time and was unsuccessful, and was sentenced to a fine of 200 yuan by your court. Now he is engaged in this opium business again, which shows that he is specializing in making a profit by selling opium. It should be severely punished. Detective Song then reported the search process. Liu Kaifu confessed that the opium belonged to him and had nothing to do with others. Xia Youliang and others denied selling opium and hired a lawyer to defend them. After Judge Qian Hongye verified the confessions, he announced the judgment in court: Liu Kaifu and Xia Youliang were each sentenced to one year imprisonment and fined 300 yuan. If the fines are not paid, they will be converted to imprisonment at the rate of three yuan per day. The confiscated opium and other items were confiscated. Kan Guangjin and Zhang Wenhua were both found not guilty.</p>

They requested assistance in searching and arresting them.

They confiscated more than 90 types of books, including "New Creation Bi-Monthly", "History of the Russian Revolution", and "Development of 20th Century Russian Capitalism". They took them to the police station and sent them to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court the next morning on charges of endangering the Republic of China.

Now, the police station charged the defendants with violating Article 160 of the Criminal Law for disrupting order, as well as Articles 19 and 35 of the Publication Law for disturbing public order. Yesterday, they were transferred to the Second Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for interrogation. First, police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case and interrogated Zhou Futing, who said that Zhenli Bookstore was opened by Xiao Shuzi and that he was a dispatcher with a monthly salary of 20 yuan. However, the store specialized in selling the "New Creation Bi-Monthly", which was funded by Sun Zhesheng. Other books were wholesale from bookstores on Fourth Road and had no Communist activities. Xiao Zhongfu and Xie Zhijiang both said that they were partners in the retail department and did not know about Communist matters. They asked for investigation. Then, the defendants' defense lawyer, Luo Jiaheng, said that the defendants were all partners in the store, had no Communist connections, and had been detained for more than 40 days. He requested that they be released. The police lawyer said that the case still needed investigation and requested a postponement. Zhang Tuizhong ordered Zhou Futing to pay a 1,000 tael store guarantee. Xiao and Xie were each released on bail, to appear when summoned. The interrogation was postponed.</p>

<h3>Triangular Warfare</h3>
<p>— · Buddha</p>
<p>I have long said that Chinese affairs will not improve whether fought naturally or not. It is better to fight, to fight a big one, but the fight must be enjoyable and thorough.</p>
<p>I believe in any -ism, and the use of force is naturally no exception, but thoroughness and pleasure are always the conditions. Chinese people only know how to kill Chinese people and do not know how to kill foreigners. This is also a characteristic of our people. Now, when the national crisis is severe, our warlords are staging the good old drama of "frying beans". First, there were Han and Liu in Shandong Province, then the two Liu in Sichuan Province, and now the good show in Fujian Province has also begun. Therefore, observing the current situation and predicting future trends, it is not only a triangular war, but perhaps a quadrilateral or pentagonal war, or even countless multi-sided wars will arise in response.</p>
<p>Needless to say, their wars must have their reasons and justifications, but if they are only directed inward and not outward, any explanation will probably be untenable. Now that they have started, I do not oppose their fighting, nor can I oppose their fighting. I simply invite them to fight, but I dislike listening to such words the most: A says I am fighting to support so-and-so, and B says I am fighting to support so-and-so. To be honest, fighting to support so-and-so is nothing more than expanding one's own territory, and not fighting to support so-and-so is ultimately for expanding one's own territory. It would be better to say frankly, I am fighting for myself, I am fighting for my own territory, and I would admire that.</p>
<p>A truly good army will never support itself, nor will it support others, but only knows how to support the country. If every army could be like this, they would naturally stand on the same battle line. Supporting so-and-so is using so-and-so as a signboard to maintain one's own interests. If so-and-so is supported by others, it is merely to borrow the strength of others to establish personal power. In the end, there are still factional differences and separate camps. After all the fuss, it is still not thorough and not enjoyable.</p>

<h3>How to Preserve Food from Spoiling</h3>
<p>— · Shao · Liang</p>
<p>If the food we eat every day is left for a few days, it will develop an unbearable stench and an inedible taste. This stench and taste are food spoilage. All food spoilage is due to the fact that there are many microorganisms in the air that scatter everywhere. When they encounter food, they parasitize on it, producing enzymes that cause the food to ferment and gradually decompose, leading to spoilage. These microorganisms have a strong reproductive capacity and can not only parasitize on food, but also reproduce in the bodies of animals and plants, or in human blood. If we let them run into our food and eat it, it is not only unsanitary, but also causes illness. Therefore, the food we eat should be preserved using one of the following four methods.</p>
<p>(1) Drying method: Molds and bacteria can only parasitize on moist food. If the moisture contained in the food is dried in the sunlight or in an oven, molds and bacteria will not be able to parasitize. Even if it is left for many days, it will not easily spoil. This is called the drying preservation method.</p>
<p>(2) Cold method: When molds and bacteria encounter food at a temperature close to the freezing point of Celsius, they cannot reproduce. Therefore, when the weather is very hot in summer, putting food in the refrigerator for a day or two will keep it as fresh as new. This is called the cold preservation method.</p>
<p>(3) Heating method: Molds and bacteria, when encountering food</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>at a temperature close to the boiling point of Celsius, cannot survive. Therefore, canned foods sold in the market are first placed in tin cans, heated externally, and when they are heated above the boiling point, the can opening is tightly sealed. The food in the can can be stored for a long time without spoiling. This is called the heating preservation method.</p>
<p>(4) Chemical method: Molds and bacteria cannot reproduce in salt or honey. Therefore, salted meat, salted fish, salted vegetables, etc., which we often eat, are all pickled with salt, and even after being stored for many days, the taste remains fresh. Also, candied fruits sold in the market are all soaked in honey and can be stored for many days without changing their taste. This is called the chemical preservation method.</p>

<h3>Discussion on Improving Ancestral Hall Management</h3>
<p>— · Wang · Shi · Ben</p>
<p>Chinese people's clan concept is more profound than their national concept. Therefore, wealthy families all raise some assets within their clan to establish an ancestral hall as an organization to provide relief to the orphans and the poor within the clan, and as a place to enshrine the ancestral tablets and hold sacrifices. After the establishment of such an ancestral hall, the poor families within the clan naturally benefit a lot, which can reduce the occurrence of bad things within the clan and preserve the entire reputation of the clan. Therefore, the establishment of this ancestral hall is indeed very important. However, in practice, apart from providing a small amount of relief to the poor within the clan and enshrining those ignorant gods, there is simply no other benefit to be found. Moreover, they are all poorly managed and lack good regulations for management and protection. Therefore, we often see a very large ancestral hall being messed up by the managers for several years and then going bankrupt, causing the career painstakingly planned and managed by the ancestors to be destroyed. It is impossible to express the sigh of sorrow. Therefore, I have now written a few sentences on methods for improving management to serve as a discussion for managing and protecting the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>(1) Management Regulations: To maintain this kind of clan organization permanently, the first thing to do is to abolish the old board of directors system. Because this kind of system is nothing more than placing the entire authority of the ancestral hall in the hands of one or two people, resulting in embezzlement of public funds, encroachment on public property, and even regarding the ancestral property jointly owned by the entire clan as personal private property to be taken at will. As a result, the ancestral hall inevitably goes bankrupt. Therefore, to break this bad practice, it is necessary to abolish this bad board of directors system and establish an ancestral hall management committee separately. Some clan members who are fair and competent in handling affairs should be elected by the entire clan to serve as committee members, and they should be re-elected once a year to prevent them from becoming entrenched over time. The powers of this committee include managing matters relating to the ancestral hall that should be established and reformed, and handling all public undertakings of the clan. As for its internal organization, it can be divided into several sections, such as finance, undertakings, education, property, and miscellaneous affairs, to handle affairs separately in an orderly manner. All income and expenditure accounts within the ancestral hall should be published every six months or one year to show the great credibility of financial transparency. On the one hand, the members of the entire clan should also supervise and guide it at any time, so as to avoid the occurrence of autocratic infringement and other malpractices, and the ancestral property can be passed down permanently.</p>
<p>(2) Undertaking Undertakings: It is often seen that existing ancestral halls, apart from distributing some grain and rice to the poor and orphans in the clan at the end of the year and offering sacrifices to ancestors at the four seasons and eight festivals, have no other undertakings to be found. Therefore, the contribution of the ancestral hall to the clan's interests is also very small. Now, a certain amount of the public funds received by the ancestral hall should be set aside to run a clan school so that the poor children in the clan have the opportunity to attend school, reducing the number of illiterate people in the clan and raising the clan's status externally. In addition, a clan library should be set up, and some useful books and newspapers on society, family, agriculture, medicine, etc. should be purchased and placed in it, so that members of the entire clan have the opportunity to study, increase their knowledge, and have a place to cultivate their character and relax their spirits. As a result, outstanding talents can be created in the clan to avoid degrading the reputation of the entire clan. In addition, the sacrificial system should also be reformed. In short, the premise should be practical and economical, and all old, false, and extravagant actions should be abolished. As for how to improve it, the undertaking section of the committee can draft detailed rules and implement them separately.</p>
<p>Because the Chinese national organization, in practice, takes the clan organization as the unit, only by striving to improve the ancestral hall problem will there be good people. Only with good people can the country become strong. Now, due to space limitations, I cannot list the methods of improvement in detail, but I will briefly list the main points for discussion, and I hope that the members will not hesitate to give advice.</p>
<p>Source of Illness</p>
<h3>Tuberculosis Patient</h3>
<p>— · Hui</p>
<p>With a tired and wounded heart, he staggered back to the dormitory with heavy and slow steps. As soon as he stepped into the door, a stuffy air rushed towards him, making him want to vomit. He quickly opened the small window and took out two glass bottles full of medicine from his bag and casually placed them on the table, which was piled with books, wine bottles, and scattered manuscripts. His legs could no longer support his heavy body, and he collapsed silently on the bed, but he kept wheezing and coughing.</p>
<p>The dormitory was so small and dark, and with the autumn rain lingering, the room felt even more gloomy and depressing, increasing his sadness. He picked up the diagnosis from the doctor just now, and his eyes became moist. He thought: "I heard that tuberculosis in the third stage is incurable! Ah, it's over! The doctor told me to rest, think less, and work less, but do poor people who make a living by selling articles also have the right to not think and work less? Moreover, can this broken heart, which has suffered a severe wound, be calmed down and not be painful and agitated? ·· It's over, it's over! Haha, everything is over! ·····"</p>
<p>He gradually became like a madman; on his pale and thin face, reddish-brown slowly emerged. His heart was burning, and his throat felt intensely dry and itchy. He got up and coughed loudly and forcefully. After a long time, his mouth felt strangely fishy, his chest heaved, and finally he coughed up a mouthful of phlegm and spat it into a paper cup. He found streaks of鲜 red jumping in the phlegm, and also something fishy and foul-smelling. As he looked at it, his eyes darkened, and his whole body weakened. He lay back down heavily.</p>
<p>A damnable and sad era unfolded again before his eyes. At the beginning of this era, who did not envy him as the lucky one of the times? Even when he and she were burning with love, he never dreamed that the curtain of tragedy would be raised at that time. This was when he met her again after dropping out of school, and he found that she was already lying softly in the arms of that big-bellied man. For him, this was certainly enough to drive him crazy, although he understood very well that this love, built on material things and dominated by economic conditions, was an inevitable result for him. But it had left a deep mark on his heart, and no matter how he tried to wash it away, there were always some blurry shadows left! These shadows and a little shallow reason conflicted and contradicted each other in his heart! Sometimes he knew very well that not being united with a woman who had no love or did not understand love was an extremely fortunate thing, and from then on he could seek development in his career. But, at the same time, that charming and lovable shadow appeared, and he relived the sweetness and sourness. Then his heart ached, and he had murderous thoughts. When he saw the bright, shiny blade, his hand trembled uncontrollably again, and his wildly beating heart made him unable to support his body, and all his courage disappeared! Sometimes he was angry: "Women, what are they? ·· Aren't they just items that can be traded with money? ··" This was inevitable, and his pain and depression could only be relieved by indulging in the flesh market! Revelry, unrestrained drinking, yes, he deeply embarked on the suicidal path of revelry and unrestrained drinking!</p>
<p>His throat was always dry and itchy, and he kept coughing. He had gotten used to the streaks of blood in his phlegm, and he no longer felt the terror and panic he had at the beginning, because he knew that tuberculosis in the third stage was incurable.</p>
<p>Fragments of Life</p>
<h3>Young Woman's Diary</h3>
<p>— · Wu</p>
<p>September 16th</p>
<p>Our life is completely different from last year. Last year, I often felt the sweetness of life, but now I am a slave to my child.</p>
<p>Ah B is overburdened because of the family, and is busy outside all day long. We have no time to talk, not even for Miss.</p>
<p>For a long time, today's six jiao and six yang were diagnosed and treated, and it was obviously much better. Originally, the doctor wanted me to go again tomorrow, of course, I have to ask my husband's permission, but he only hurriedly replied "Whatever you want". Then, in order to save expenses and to be considerate of his difficulties in earning money, I have to endure the pain and let the wound heal slowly.</p>
<p>However, lately Ah B has been increasingly tortured by life, and his bored mood often makes him feel bored with everything: for example, his indifferent attitude towards me is something that did not exist last year.</p>
<p>September 19th</p>
<p>Because of the family's financial difficulties, and because the child occasionally catches a cold, we often quarrel, and there is not even a good discussion about small things. It is simply not as harmonious as an old-fashioned family.</p>
<p>However, I should bear most of the responsibility, because I cannot go further to understand him and forgive him. Ah, how stupid I am!</p>
<p>However, if this continues, I really feel scared. Pain and boredom.</p>
<p>The child is growing more and more lovely, and it is precisely because of his loveliness that I feel sad, isn't it? If it were not for this child, my whole heart would belong to my husband.</p>
<p>Lately I have been suffering from insomnia every night, but Ah B falls asleep tired as soon as he gets into bed. He is too tired, his face is thin and bony, almost like a skeleton.</p>
<p>I remember that last year we were materially very poor, but spiritually we were very happy. When there was no rice, Ah B himself would fight to eat porridge and leave the rice for me to eat. Ah! How wonderful it was then! Now, sometimes I buy something that I want to buy, and he uses all his words to scold me. I really wonder, why has he become like this? I shed tears and hide my pain from him.</p>
<p>In short, I hope to find a suitable job.</p>
<p>September 30th</p>
<p>Today he actually ran away, leaving me and running to a place I don't know. I can't fall asleep no matter what, my heart, a desolate heart, a broken heart, ah, stabbing pain!</p>
<p>He said; "Besides love, there are more important things than love." Then what are these important things? Is it the Society's career? Is it revolution? Or is it to throw himself into the arms of another woman again?</p>
<p>That's right, in the past, when he was infatuated with love, he completely abandoned everything else, he believed that everything hindered love, and now, the crazy era has passed, so love hinders everything.</p>
<p>Ah! Mamma! I really need you to comfort me at this moment!</p>
<p>He has left me now, of course he will not be considerate of my embarrassing mood at this moment.</p>
<p>Okay, everything is over, now I should start doing what I have to do. I hope I will never hear the crying of that lovely child.</p>
<p>I can't support it at this moment, I want to fall on the bed. Sickness is fine. Death is fine, I cannot tremble, and at the same time no one cares about me, and, why should they care about me?</p>
<p>Everything is over, even that lovely child is included.</p>
<p>"Die or go forward!"</p>
<p>Alas!</p>
<h3>Double Tenth Day Diary</h3>
<p>— · Yi · Ping</p>
<p>Today is the National Day again, but how different is everything from the National Crisis of September 18th! The government has ordered a ban on celebrations. A country's National Day, and it has come to the point of banning celebrations. Should we little people cry or laugh? Our group is worried about the problem of bread every day and has no time for it. National affairs are just occasional. Remembering that it was not easy for the martyrs to create the Republic of China, in the face of foreign insults and internal strife, we let out one or two sighs of injustice!</p>
<p>Keeping my old friend's appointment, I jumped on the tram, which was still crowded with people. I asked or saw a few national flags, all shyly fluttering in the air. The game fields and influencing yards were full of black heads, but entertainment was saving the country!</p>
<p>When I met my old friend, he dragged me out and ran to the restaurant. My old friend is a patriotic man. He had gone to the front line on January 28th. Later, he suffered a crushing defeat and almost wanted to commit suicide. He is very emotional. Today, he probably specially invited me to vent his grievances. At the restaurant, I saw him drinking wildly. I didn't know how to comfort him.</p>
<p>"Is China as hopeless as we are?" Finally, he blurted out this sentence.</p>
<p>"It's embarrassing to say," he continued, "What have we done for the country! In school, we would still blush and shout a few slogans on every commemorative day. What about now?" He seemed to be asking himself.</p>
<p>"The people's hearts are not cold yet," he turned around and said, "Just take January 28th as an example. The people's love for the 19th Route Army, the volunteer army ran to the front line, but why are national crises not allowed to be commemorated, and National Day not allowed to be celebrated? Ah! What if the people's hearts are cold?" He raised an empty wine glass and looked at the roof, without saying the rest. However, his eyes were already shining.</p>
<p>I was almost stunned, because I had never seen him so crazy as today. Fortunately, there was no one in the restaurant, so I had no choice but to drag him downstairs.</p>
<p>"Friend, why don't you let me drink? I have never been so sad as today ······"</p>
<p>"Old friend, you're drunk, I'll help you back,"</p>
<p>"Who says I'm drunk!" He opened his scary eyes.</p>
<p>It was dinner time when I returned from his home. Seeing a large pile of newspapers on the table, I didn't look at them and put them on the pile of old newspapers.</p>
<p>The National Day passed like my age, and there were still no satisfactory things. I hope again like every year! I hope to cheer up next year and celebrate our National Day enthusiastically.</p>

<h3>The Yellow Dog Barks</h3>
<p>— · Xiao · Gang</p>
<p>It was a long, long summer afternoon.</p>
<p>After a hearty meal of ordinary fish and meat at the Zhang residence, the second young master had already taken the hot towel squeezed by the old nanny, wiped his greasy face, and sat on the monk's chair. This was the usual practice: the second young master had to smoke after defecating. Now he reached into his shirt pocket and took out a delicate flat box, and took out a cigarette from it! Naturally, he needed fire to light it, but for this small matter, the second young master didn't need to bother himself. Wang Da, who had been waiting by his side for a long time, was just thinking about finding something to do for the second young master to curry favor with him, had already struck the match. "So fragrant! Cligue?"</p>
<p>Wang Da, who liked to drink and smoke, was swallowing a puff of smoke downwind and praising wildly. But his mouth moved, revealing the annoying sores all over his mouth and corners of his mouth to the second young master.</p>
<p>"Ugh! Did you steal and eat fecal waste from the latrine?"</p>
<p>But the second young master didn't really hate Wang Da who was currying favor with him. Moreover, he heard the noble brand of cigarette, "Cligue," coming from the mouth that had stolen fecal waste to eat, and he was actually a little happy. So, although he was holding a "Little Beauty" cigarette, and although he saw the annoying sores at the corners of his mouth, he smiled and grunted "Ugh ||."</p>
<p>Seeing the smile on the second young master's face, Wang Da thought his chance had come, so he asked the second young master for help:</p>
<p>"Help me with the mahjong game today, second young master!"</p>
<p>There was always the sound of mahjong at the Zhang residence every day. Either the new mistress was playing, or the second young master was playing. When there were many people, there were often two tables. The second young master's interest in mahjong was really great. Now that Wang Da asked for help, the second young master, of course, was moved to the point of excitement, but to agree immediately seemed to demean his status as a young master. So he suddenly kicked the yellow dog that was lying at his feet and panting, and said:</p>
<p>"It's so hot, who would be happy?" The second young master seemed unhappy.</p>
<p>"Master Chen is always coming to play: Young Master Dai, and Mr. Lu, I've already invited them," Wang Da seemed a little anxious.</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke of Cao Cao, Cao Cao arrived. Master Chen and Young Master Dai had been rushing to the Zhang residence all their lives. After the guests and hosts greeted each other for a while, Wang Da was driven by a dollar and quickly began to set up the table and fasten the tablecloth.</p>
<p>"Master Chen isn't here to play mahjong?"</p>
<p>The second young master knew that Master Chen also had a temper: that is, when there were exactly four people, he would definitely pretend that he wasn't happy to be playing mahjong. Sure enough, when Master Chen heard the second young master's words, he casually got up from the rattan couch to play mahjong.</p>
<p>"Wang Da! If you want to ask Master Chen Lin to play mahjong, you must kowtow to him three times to beg him."</p>
<p>Someone next to him pointed out a way to Wang Da. So Wang Da, wearing a face that was both crying and laughing, asked Master Chen to get up and play mahjong.</p>
<p>"Bark like a yellow dog three times! And I'll play mahjong with you:" At the same time, Master Chen stood up and told everyone that Wang Da could bark like a yellow dog.</p>
<p>"Good! Bark like a yellow dog three times! I agree!" The second young master also jumped up from the monk's chair, showing his happiness again.</p>
<p>"Bark like a yellow dog! Bark and we'll play!"</p>
<p>People next to him taught Wang Da to respond like this, and also wanted to hear someone bark like a dog.</p>
<p>Wang Da knew that the masters were making fun of him, but he also knew that saying he couldn't bark like a dog would ruin the masters' fun. So he held the corners of his mouth full of sores with both hands and said "Woof woof woof" in a way that was neither dog-like nor human-like: "I can't do it."</p>
<p>However, the masters seemed to have heard the sound of a yellow dog barking, and everyone sat down at the table to draw tiles.</p>
