<h3 id="c150">失陷於倭之錦州談 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>倭奴鐵騎。長驅直入。而錦州以失陷聞矣。地距女兒河二十五里。遼置州。清爲府。屬盛京。民國廢。今錦縣其舊治也。明末祖大壽守錦州。聞松山失。獻城降清。是地爲兵家所爭。非自今日始也。西爲小凌河。北爲沙家墳。而唐家屯在其東。有轎車大車爲交通。蓋轎車載人。大車運貨。甚便利也。市塲俱在城中。城外絕少市集。城中大佛寺。有浮圖一。高三十丈許。相傅爲唐代所建。民多迷信神權。每歲廢曆四月十八日。爲娘娘會期。其他更有四月二十八日之地藏會。五月二十八日之城隍會。均有雜要演戲諸舉。所以媚神祈福者。窮力以爲之。附近有觀音洞及金牛洞。夏未秋初。草木蓊鬱。士女來游者。絡繹不絕。尤多晝家寫生。蓋境佳地勝。宜於丹青點染也。物產有蝦油小菜。氈條。氈帽鞋。猪。猪毛。羊毛。豆子。豆餅。均運至平津及營口等處售銷。營業頗盛。此次倭人肆暴。損失之巨。爲從來所未有。倭人以焚殺爲揚威。姦淫爲樂事。某軍人嘗闖入小新民屯王姓家。王家少婦新寡。頗有姿色。軍人欲沔之。婦故意留之飲。酒酣。婦特以酒甇擊軍人首。用力猛。首破腦流而死。婦知肇禍。即仰藥自殺。聞者謂民國以來。世風日下。婦女之節烈事。絕少聞見。偶有談之者。莫不媸爲迂腐。今不料於國難聲中。竟有此一段可歌可泣之事蹟。洵難得已。北平歸客述及。特表場之。亦我輩操觚者之責也。</p>

<p>— 斯人</p>
<p>新年元旦。荀慧生以其長子令香。從程玉霜游。在豐澤園設宴。行拜師禮。是日午后五時。慧生率令香登程宅。恭迎玉霜至豐澤園。嘉賓多自挟賀聯而來。琳琅滿目。茲錄其佳者。悔廬聯云。［程門立雪］。［荀子如龍］。劉曉桑聯云。［玉潤霜清。輝映程門三尺雪］。［硯池秋</p>
<p>水。平添荀令幾分香。］又去。［雪牘侍伊川。濁世今見佳公子］。［竹書承闇解。故人樂有賢父兄］。鐘鳴六句。行拜師禮。禮成入席。來賓推劉曉桑致祝詞。略謂［今日爲元旦佳節。玉霜不久將出國考查劇藝。作第一次之壯游。令香又於今日拜玉霜爲師。實爲空前之盛會。予希望令香不徒學取玉霜風靡一世的腔調。尤要繼續玉霜革新戲劇的偉業。則其成就當在一般名伶之上］。次由徐凌霄演講。略謂［玉霜之成爲宗派。不徒以腔調見長。其心思才力日趨於戲劇的使命之途。逈非常人所可及。且不日赴歐游學。將以光大劇藝。實戲劇界空前之壯舉。今令香於此時拜師求學。其意義頗爲嚴重。希望玉霜悉心傅授。俾令香成爲有功劇藝之人。所以我用兩句戲詞父是英雄兒好漢。强將手下無弱兵爲令香賀］。至是。來賓要求玉霜致答詞。玉霜略謂。［今天是我三十歲的第一日。又是我改名硯秋的第一日。又是我收錄門徒的第一日。孔子說三十而立。這立是能站得起。這站得起是很不昜的。我行年三十。所以把艷麗的艷字改爲硯田的硯字。我這硯田還是開墾荒田。不過種田的農人都是希望有收穫的。孔子又說。人之患在好爲人師。我現在還不能站得起。今忽爲人師。豈非自相矛盾。但是我收令香爲徒。有兩種原因。第一因爲令香聰敏。習英文算術。頗知勤學。所以我願意爲他的師。第二因爲慧生是我的前輩。藝術高明。我所敎不到的地方有他加以補正。所以我敢於爲他的師。學劇的門徑。須先學崑曲。以立基礎。王泊生先生說並須先學話劇。予極贊成。因爲話劇無音樂以爲倚傍。其内心表演。尤爲困難。望令香努力爲之］。次由慧生致答詞。略謂［玉霜所講的話。過於客氣。我的藝術不高明。不能敎子。所以命子求敎高明。諸位先生所講的話維護藝術。受益良多。過愛小子。尤爲感謝。敬請諸位浮一大白］。退席後。合攝一影。賓主盡歡而散。</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>人體的眞價人類的貧富貴賤。智愚賢不肖各有不同。因此謂常人與要人的區别。要是一評他們身體的眞價。那麽無論貧富貴賤。智愚賢不肖。都是一模一樣的。英國生物學家營遜博士。Ｄｒ·Ｉ·ＥｒＬａＷ·ｓｏｎ近在某處演講。曾將人體加以化學的分析。據他說如以普通一個重量一百四十磅的人體作例子。那麽可以知道這身體中所包含的水可裝滿一隻容量十加倫的水桶。所有的脂肪可製肥皂七條。所有的炭質可製鉛筆九百枝。所有的燐質。可製火柴頭二千二百粒。所有的鎂質可製鹽一劑。所有的鐵質可製大小適中的釘子一枚。所有的石灰質可刷白一隻雞塒。所有的琉璜質可殺除一頭狗身上的蚤　統計這些質料的眞價。照目前市價計算。只須五先令便可買到。所以每一個人體。說是祇值五先令。亦無不可。</p>

<p>— 青年援馬圑一員</p>
<p>（十）京滬段總結（下）</p>
<p>我們的生活很簡單的。因爲我們是救國的隊伍。一切都是軍隊化。天未亮。軍號一響。數百個勇士便齊集在矌塲上演習。日將中。軍號復響。我們便各自拿了一個漱口器具去盛飯充飢。日西墜。軍號又響。我們也如前一樣去膳食。月東上。軍號再響我們便迅速地把舗蓋在地上打開。兩人或三人蓋着一條棉絮便去安息。如果軍號驟響。便管不得正在做富家翁或是做洞房花燭的好夢。揉一揉眼角便衝着寒威去接受命令了。</p>
<p>我們的同志很義氣的。［有飯大家吃。有事大家做。］眞的我們的心理都是這樣。但在吃東西的時候。却老實不客氣了。因爲恐怕［客氣］成了習慣。到了前方殺敵時如果也客氣起來。那不是糟了嗎。　　我們在南京睡在車裹兩夜。睡的形式很别緻的。由第一人伏在第二人的肩上。第二人也伏在第三人的肩上。這樣一個一個地伏着倒很舒服。但是。有一位同志的身體像倭寇一般的短小。因此他的頭祇能倚着下一人的臂上。又有一位同志的軀幹却特别的瘦長。於是他的頭便可以壓在次一人的脖子上。我從鼾聲震撼山川的當兒向四面窺望了一回。見了這一長一短的腦袋。不禁吃吃好笑。</p>
<p>我們有時在將睡之前。舉行濯足大會。</p>

<p>— 劉抗</p>
<p>這是留法同志劉抗最近寄給我的一封信，描寫巴黎現在秋季沙龍的情形和藝術家的生活</p>
<p>，眞是比我以前做的［歐游通信］還詳。我想一定有許多的讀者，希望聽聽最近巴黎藝壇的消息·所以我請於本刋編者將這封信發表。我就略略聲明當做小引。想劉抗也不至責我多事？　一九三二，一，一，海栗，上海存天閣。</p>
<p>海師··動筆也不知多少次了，想作個秋展的詳細報告；但是·懶呢·忙呢？我也莫明其妙地終於無結果遷延起來，這實是不幸的事。今晨接到十一月九日的來信，讀之使人興奮，於是逼得我不得不重新動筆了，我想這回終不至於再失敗吧！</p>
<p>秋展於十月一日開幕，（直至十二月十三日）以大體而言，與去歲略同。全塲中心視線又是集到篷那Ｂｏｎｎａｒｄ的兩張新作品上··緣調子的風景與金黄色的少女面像··一是清靜的，神秘的，一是熱情的，活躍的，總之，色之運角手段，可謂逹於極點。阿司朗Ａｓｓｅｌｉｎ較去年精進多多，兩幅四十號的大人與小孩的肖像Ｐｏｒｌｔａｉｔ適掛於篷那Ｂｏｎｎａｒｄ的兩旁，很有意思！因爲他們互相比較起來，一個顯出他色彩的富麗，一個更證實他質地的堅固。克司林Ｋｉｓｌｉｎｇ晝化，這次出品的那一幅，可算他生平花卉的結晶，瓷器之趣味極深。女晝家瑪佛Ｍａｒｖａｌ之［夢］，寫少婦富貴慾之幻想，極出神入化，豔麗之色，雄偉之筆，猶其餘事。蘇佛比Ｓｏｎｖｅｒｂｉｅ希臘化的人物，旣可愛又可敬。Ｂｌａｎｃ作一極大幅圖·題爲新婚之前；熱閙，歡喜皆盡情表露。至於梵鈍根Ｖａｎ　Ｄｏｎｇｅｎ·我很代他惋惜·兩張名人肖像，（政界名人日白爾東Ｂａｒｔｂｏｎ與班樂衞Ｐａｉｂｌｅｖｅ）的確有些平凡以下之流的不忠（忠於藝術）不誠（誠心對人，誠</p>
<p>心對已）的表現·爲利祿所誘，爲名勢所惑，藝人人格掃地無餘！此外賴潑剌特Ｌａｐｒａｄｅ愛司班牙Ｅｓｐａｇｎａｔ·等不進不退，一如往年，無容贅述。</p>
<p>事先問人家借來一個大缸。盛滿了清潔的温水。然後一羣一羣的同志便將腿兒伸向缸裹游泳。女同志們也是如此。有趣得很。</p>
<p>末了。此去東北尙有三分之二的道途。我們在南京尙須逗留數天。便整師前進了。同胞們。祝你們爲國珍重。前途的消息。容再奉告吧。</p>

<p>他慕伊的名貴艷麗。伊羡他的英俊豪華。每當良晨佳夕。他常到伊家裹來披襟寄嘅。娓娓清談。間或也一同並肩携手。邀游在名園勝地。舞謝歌塲。乍看去好似如花美眷。這在伊芳心可可之中。殆已經過無數次縝密的考察。費過多少回精細的衝量。深覺得安玉田這人實似一方渾璞未鑿的寳玉。凑上他那些丈夫氣槪。健兒身材。學士文章。游侠風格。都很合乎伊理想中愛人的條件。只可惜他生性有些倔强。景况又並非貧乏。像不能低首下心。皈依到伊的石榴裙下。乖乖的服從伊的指揮訓練。作個情俘般的郎君。若只圖　鰈相依。僅爲濮上桑間野駌鴦的臨時結合。又或委曲求全。甘郊那薄命憐卿退居側室的故事。皆非伊始願所及。不能這樣牽就。况且無端改變了伊的初衷。撹輸了滿盤的綦局。無異輕輕斷落了這次過合的機緣。弄成欲速不逹的過錯。焉知再堅持下去。就未必没有可乘的間隙。因此持重居奇。徘徊瞻顧。老没肯露出半星可尋的迹象。而安玉田這個人。海闊天空。粗枝大葉。雖覺得這個玲瓏　透矌代少有的佳人。常常在有意無意之間。靈犀暗通。目挑眉逗。實是對他不薄。然而細看她那名貴不可一世的儀態。大有望之堪神仙中人之槪。</p>

<p>爲着要證實我的話，隨手檢出元旦以來的本報，查一查每日記載的時人行蹝。檢查的結果··是二十年十二月三十一日，朱培德朱履龢楊虎出京，當日下午五時到滬，是晚去京的，有于右任陳紹寬孔祥熙三人。元旦以後五天無報，這五天内的要人行蹝無從查考。七日晚陳銘樞到滬；八日晨張靜江劉蘆隠劉瑞恒到滬，是晚陳紹寬朱家驊唐生智葉開鑫晋京；九日孫科黄樑于右任到滬，是晚，陳銘樞晋京；十日何應欽陳友仁到滬，是晚陳回京；十一晚褚民誼出京，是晚，劉瑞恒晋京，十二晨褚到滬。從去年十二月三十一日到今天，除去五天，爲時不過一週，而要人們來滬去京的記載，也就很有可觀了。</p>
<p>官有官守，做官的便應守其［職］，守其［責］，非必要决不容輕離職守，尤其是在這國家多難的時候，做官的就勤其所事，至於不遑宵旰猶恐不足以紓國難，慰民望。我們敢問這一羣晋京出京的要人們僕僕於京滬道上，究竟是爲了什麽？</p>
<p>南京是政治中樞，關乎國計民生的大計，便應在南京處理。除去新財長黄漢樑爲着籌要欵和金融界接洽，事實上不得不來滬以外，其餘的，究竟是來上海做什麽？爲國計民生嗎？但上海并不是政治中心地呀！</p>
<p>不是爲國計民生，不是爲公事，自然是爲私事，吃了老百姓的飯，拿了老百姓的錢，當國家多難的時候，當民困水火的時候，爲私事而優遊於上海，不理政，不管事，來去京滬道上，還要特備不要錢的花車，還要特别派兵迎送，一人之外，有時還帶着太太少爺小姐以及隨員馬弁一大羣的人，這不僅是溺職，不僅是負國負民，而且是禍國殃民了，這樣的官，我們人民要他幹嗎？</p>
<p>胡漢民先生做立法院長的時候，從未離京，從不來滬，這一黠是值得推崇的。一個負有政治重責的［官］常來這金迷紙醉的上海，他是否還有閑心置念國計民生，也就不問可知了！你僕僕於京滬道上的一羣究竟爲了什麽呢？</p>

<p>刮擦！一新聽了這很大的聲音，慌張的跑進這屋子，看見桌上臉盆裹面有一個壓扁的小洋鐵罐頭。他的哥煥新，站在旁邊笑嘻嘻的，很表現一種高興的樣子。</p>
<p>一新│哥哥！剛才是什麽東西響？］</p>
<p>煥新│［是我在做一個有趣的實騐，</p>
<p>你看這臉盆水的中間，不是有一個壓扁的洋鐵罐頭麽？這洋鐵罐頭原來是一個好的·剛才刮擦一聲，就是牠在作怪發出的響聲·］</p>
<p>一新│［新牠怎樣發出這響聲來，又怎樣會被壓扁呢？］</p>
<p>煥新│［我拿了一個好好的罐頭，在罐頂中間開一小圓孔，取出菜後，灌進了四分之一的水，舉火燒開，使其沸騰，即用木塞緊緊封口，（若不緊時，或擦</p>
<p>上火漆及其牠可封口的東西·</p>
<p>）投入臉盆水裹面·只過了五六分鐘的光景，牠就刮擦一聲，這洋鐵瓶忽然就壓扁掉了。］</p>
<p>一新│［這是什麽理由呢］</p>
<p>煥新│［因洋鐵瓶裹面，只有四分之一的水，被火燒沸騰後，水蒸汽將瓶内有的空氣，完全驅逐淨盡了·上面封了瓶口，僅有滿滿的水蒸汽在裹面·把牠投進臉盆冷水裹，大約在五六分鐘上下的時間，那水蒸汽受了冷，就完全變成冷水了·洋鐵罐即成了眞空，我們知道大氣的壓力是很大的，每平方時的面積約有十五磅壓力。罐冷了，裹面除少許水外，什麽東西都没有，受着大氣的壓力·便刮擦一聲壓得一圑糟。這瓶體之所以壓扁的緣故，原來就是因爲外面大量空氣的壓力·這不是一個有趣的一回事吧？</p>

<p>這銀行王Ｚ·Ｂ·摩爾幹是賣掉了父親所愛藏的美術品得着許多現金而開始的。當時他家裹的人都衆口一聲的反對，人們都對他加以自私自利的，小器的惡評。可是頑强而自信的Ｚ·Ｂ·不顧家中的反對和人世的批評，默默地斷行了他的自信，那末他眞的是小器嗎？事實上决不是那樣。</p>
<p>其實他父親所遺傅給他的，只有這此美術品，和所負債相等的財產，如無價值的股票，以及一千九百萬的現金，但是他不能不支付三百萬金的遺產稅，不能不遵照遺言而分配財產，更不得不經營着龐大的事業；所以他確是陷於不得不變賣父親所愛藏的美術品的苦境中。　　他是這樣决然的斷行了，於是他便挽。回了家運而成功這偉大的銀行王摩爾幹了。於是他不僅是成爲美國金融界的支配者，在大戰中借給恊約國方面百五十萬萬元的借欵，而從歐洲吸入百萬萬的金塊，以數百萬萬元的兵器糧食而將歐洲諸國從生死境内救了出來。果然他成爲比父親更偉大的銀行王了。</p>

<p>［現在做的事業，什麽時候才能發展，我們還不知道。我們還是合力來從事銅山罷。］</p>
<p>兒子們都非常贊成，於是他的銅山業便從此開始。特别是他的第三子戴尼爾更有爲敢。不久一個年產五十萬吨，佔世界產業二分之一的大銅山王國便這樣建設起來了。</p>

<p>×最初的貿昜與關稅</p>
<p>商埠開放後，蘇松太道指定六家錢莊代發進出口稅以及噸稅的收據。英領巴爾福提出抗議，認爲違背條約，因恐英人商業爲少數人所包辦也。英領本欲擬定凡外貨到埠，未售之前不付關稅的制度，經欽差大臣之反對，遂作罷諭。</p>
<p>開關以後最初六星期以内，即是十一月十四日至十二月三十一日，僅有商船七隻進港。進口貨物總價爲四十三萬三千七百二十九兩，出口貨物總價值爲十四萬七千一百七十二兩。所收進口稅爲一萬六千五百六十四兩八錢；出口稅爲七千五百三十七兩一錢九分。共收噸稅九百八十五兩，較之從前廣州所收噸稅减輕多矣。</p>
<p>×治外法權的開始</p>
<p>所謂治外法權，即是外我在中國境土以内不受中國法律的管轄，而受其本國駐在中國領事裁判，所以又名日領事裁判權。</p>
<p>南京條約並未明白承認外人在中國通商口岸享有治外法權，但咸豐八年五月中英續約第十五，十六，十七三欵以及同年五月中美條約第二十二，二十八二欵，始明白承認外人在中國通商口岸享有治外法權。</p>
<p>咸豐八年中英續約第十七欵去；［凡英國民人控告中國民人事件，應先赴領事官衙門投禀，領事官即當查明根由，先行勤息，使不成訟，中國人民有赴領事官告英國民人者，領事官亦應一體勸息，問有不能勸息者，即由中國地方官與領事官會同審辦，公平訊斷。］</p>
<p>又中美條約第二十七欵云··［大合衆國民人在中國通商各港口，有因財產涉訟，由本國領事等官訊明辦理，若大合衆國民人，在中國與别國貿易之人，因事爭論者，應聽兩造，查照各本國所立條約辦理，中國官員，不得過問。］</p>
<p>又第二十八欵云··</p>
<p>［大合衆國民人，因有要事向中國地方官辦訟，先禀明領事等官，查明禀内字句明順，事在情理者，即爲轉行地方官查辦，中國商民因有要事向領事等官辯訴者，准其一面禀地方官，一面到領事等官，禀呈查辦，倘遇有中國人與大合衆國人，因事相爭，不能以和平調處者，即須兩國官員，查明公議察奪，更不得索取規費，並准請人到堂代傅，以免言語不通，致受委曲］</p>
<p>自從這幾欵條約訂定以後，外人得在中國境内享受治外法權，不受中國法律的管轄，於是租界以内，匪盜縱横，無惡不作，上海得成爲遠東的罪惡淵藪，都是由於這種不平等條約發生的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Heavy Losses for Japanese Troops on Datong Line <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Many Enemy Soldiers Annihilated by Volunteers Near Xinlitun; Badaling River Power Plant Destroyed; Japanese Troop Train Derails; Volunteers Establish Contact with Zhang Shusen's Brigade (Beiping) After the Japanese army occupied Jinzhou, a large number of them crossed Yixian southward towards the more than 3,000 civilians. On the 10th, they fought fiercely with the Japanese army at Chaoyang Temple. Our civilian army leaders Bi Jingshan and Zhang Menglin fought for five hours. Due to the coercion of Japanese aircraft, they retreated to Luotuo Gou North on the 9th and have established contact with Zhang Shusen's brigade in Beipiao. They are still engaged in fierce fighting. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, but ammunition is running out and there is no way to resupply. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army in Suizhong, hearing that the Japanese army in the Qianhushan area was surrounded by volunteers and fearing their retreat would be cut off, urgently retreated eastward yesterday. Passenger trains outside the pass are still not running. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Xiansheng received reports on the war situation against Japan from various volunteer forces, stating: 1. According to a telegram from the Eighth Route Army on the 10th, on the morning of the 3rd, the five regiments of the Third Brigade's cavalry withdrew from Tongliao and were completely occupied by Mongolian bandits and the Japanese army. Our troops counterattacked. On the 4th, we formally engaged with the main force of the Japanese infantry, approximately 2,400 men, four 450-horsepower aircraft, and two armored trains. Japanese aircraft dropped a total of forty-odd 250-pound bombs, injuring 34 civilians, destroying more than 60 civilian houses, and injuring more than 30 of our officers and soldiers. Fierce fighting continues. 2. The First Route Army reported that they repelled the enemy at Dahushan early on the 7th, killing 42 enemy soldiers, capturing 18 rifles, with two officers killed, one injured, and 31 soldiers injured or killed. One enemy armored vehicle was destroyed. 3. The Fourth Route Army reported that from the 9th to dawn on the 10th, the enemy reinforced with a total brigade of infantry. Due to our side running out of ammunition and supplies, we temporarily retreated towards Xintai Bianmen. 4. The Fifth Route Army reported that they shot down one enemy aircraft, killing two pilots and officers. The Fourth Route Army also shot down one aircraft, with both the aircraft and crew burned. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The volunteers at Dahushan have won successive battles. On the 10th, a Japanese troop train derailed, causing considerable damage. All the Japanese troops in Xinmin were mobilized. On the 11th, 13 troop trains departed from Shenyang for Jinzhou, Dahushan, and other places. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army in Jinxi is heavily surrounded by our volunteer army under Geng Jizhou and other units. Although the main force of the Shi Shitu's regiment has arrived as reinforcements, they are unable to break through. Many Japanese soldiers have been killed. All Japanese aircraft in Jinzhou have departed for Honglu Mountain to bomb. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Saga Flying Corps from Sipingjie departed for Jinxi yesterday afternoon. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinzhou Yesterday, near Xinlitun on the Datong Railway, our volunteer army inflicted a major defeat on the Japanese army. Xinlitun is located 20 li north of Dahushan. The brigade of Japanese Major General Murai suffered heavy losses. Our volunteer army surrounded their infantry and cavalry, engaging in fierce fighting for several hours, killing two officers and thirty soldiers. Eventually, a portion of the Japanese army broke out of the encirclement and fled back to Dahushan, with the rest still engaged in fierce fighting. The reinforcements dispatched by the Japanese side derailed en route after departing from Dahushan and are now proceeding on foot. It is reported that our volunteer army is stationed everywhere along the Datong Railway, and their momentum is strong. There are also many volunteers along the Anfeng Road and near the South Manchuria Railway. However, according to today's announcement from Jinzhou, the brigade of Major General Yoda has occupied the city, and other Japanese troops are also advancing towards the Rehe border to attack the volunteers. (12th Nationalist Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) According to news from here this morning, a number of Japanese soldiers fought fiercely with 5,000 volunteers near Xinlitun. The entire Japanese unit has now been annihilated. However, reinforcements are currently en route to assist. The Japanese soldiers included a small infantry squad and a group of engineers. They resisted the enemy at night, resulting in the death of four officers and 2,000 soldiers, with the remainder injured except for ten people. The ten uninjured men escaped from the dangerous area and occupied the power plant at Badaohe, continuing to fight. However, the volunteers pressed closer and closer, eventually destroying the power plant. These ten men disappeared along with the power plant. It is not yet known whether there were any survivors. With the power plant destroyed, thick smoke filled the air, and Xinlitun, Dahushan, and Jinzhou were immediately plunged into darkness. However, the misfortunes encountered by the Japanese army did not end there. An armored train reportedly rushed to the rescue upon hearing the alarm, speeding away from Dahushan. However, while traveling somewhere near Xinlitun, the train suddenly derailed and overturned. There are no details on casualties. According to investigations, several sections of the track at this location had been dismantled by the volunteers. The lightly injured Japanese soldiers and a small number of reinforcements who broke through the encirclement are now holding Xinlitun with few against many, and have reported everything to the Dahushan headquarters.

<h3 id="e2">Japanese Army Plans to Occupy Rehe <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Military Leaders Actively Propagating</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The activities of the Japanese army seem likely to extend to the Mongolian territory soon. Unconfirmed news is spreading in Tokyo today that Commander Honjo is now planning to send three columns of troops into Inner Mongolia. In the coming months, the Japanese army may occupy the Rehe provincial capital and other important cities. A portion of the Japanese military leaders advocate attacking Mongolia, and have begun actively propagating this month, expressing opinions on radio broadcasting stations, stating that Japan's demands for special interests in Mongolia will be of no use unless they are realized. This statement implicitly suggests that only the use of force can achieve such interests. Military observers here now believe that even without other reasons, from the perspective of "clearing the fields," it is necessary to attack Mongolia. Several tens of thousands of scattered soldiers under Zhang Xueliang are still loyal to Zhang, and he will use Inner Mongolia as a base to attack the Japanese army in Manchuria. As a preventive measure, the Japanese army must strike first. However, from a military perspective, once such a war begins, it is unknown when it will end, because Mongolia is vast and sparsely populated. The Japanese army may win temporarily, but the patriotic volunteers are unpredictable and will counterattack at any opportunity. (12th Nationalist News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to the Dadao News Agency, Chen Youren proposed steps to sever diplomatic relations with Japan at the Central Political Conference last week. Although the majority agreed, it was ultimately decided to be cautious due to the advocacy of a certain important person, who believed that a comprehensive plan must be formulated first. The recent gatherings of government officials in Shanghai and the dispatch of personnel to Ningbo and Hong Kong may be related to this matter. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Burning Down the Entire City Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Disturbing the Republic of China Daily Newspaper Office</p>
<p>Destroying the Public Security Branch</p>
<p>Firing Guns in the Streets to Demonstrate</p>
<p>(Qingdao) At around 9:00 AM on the 12th, two Japanese rioters armed with handguns broke into the business department of the Republic of China Daily, firing seven shots, without injuring anyone, and setting fire to the southern corner of the newspaper office, which was quickly extinguished. Japanese residents throughout the city held a meeting at the Foreign Residents' Association at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, resulting in three demands to the municipal government: 1. Dissolve the City Party Headquarters. 2. Close down the Republic of China Daily. 3. Punish the president and editor-in-chief. The municipal government is deliberating on a reply. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) After the emergency meeting of Japanese residents, rioters were again dispatched, armed with guns, wooden sticks, and knives, to provoke trouble at the Republic of China Daily, firing shots. They then went to the City Party Headquarters building, setting fire and firing more than ten shots, without injuring anyone. All personnel of the Party Headquarters fled. In order to avoid escalating the incident, the authorities only dispatched several plainclothes officers to secretly monitor, without any conflict occurring. However, the Japanese continued to provoke trouble. The municipal government has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese consulate. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) At 7:30 PM on the 12th, hundreds of members of the Japanese Kokusuikai departed from the Japanese shrine, shouting wildly along Zhongshan Road, with an imposing manner, and rushed to the Foreign Residents' Association, appearing to be preparing for a riot. European and American residents, due to the seriousness of the situation, held a meeting at the International General Association on the night of the 12th to discuss preventive measures. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) At 9:30 PM, Japanese rioters used firewater and kerosene to burn down the entire City Party Headquarters and destroyed the office of the Fourth Branch. They fired guns along the streets. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The Republic of China Daily in Qingdao previously published a lengthy article on the incident of the Korean Lee Bong-chang's attempted assassination of the Japanese Emperor, which failed, containing the phrase "Korean patriots attempted to assassinate the Japanese Emperor, unfortunately failing." The Japanese Consul in Qingdao has now seized on this as an excuse to lodge a serious protest with the Qingdao Municipal Government, demanding that the author of the article be punished and that the Mayor of Qingdao apologize. Furthermore, the Japanese residents of Qingdao have convened a general meeting of residents to discuss how to deal with these remarks that defame the Imperial Family.

<p>(Harbin) According to Japanese sources, there is a danger that the troops of Xi Qia and Ding Chao will start a war near Harbin in the near future. They are holding daily meetings in Fushun Township to discuss this matter. It is rumored that Ding Chao's subordinates are demanding an immediate attack on Xi Qia.

<p>(Beiping) A draft of the founding outline for the new state of Manchu-Mongolia, manipulated by Japan, has been prepared. The main points are: 1. Abolish warlord autocracy and adopt "交治主义" (governance-sharing doctrine). 2. Adopt a constitutional system based on the theory of separation of powers. 3. Adopt the people's autonomy doctrine unique to China. 4. Concentrate power in the central government and strive to reduce the powers of the provinces to facilitate unification. As for the constitution of the new state, it will combine the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai's New Covenant Act, Cao Kun's Constitution, and the Kuomintang's Five-Power Constitution, and create a new constitution. That is, establishing a State Council, that is, the cabinet, the Supreme Court, the Legislative Yuan, and the Procuratorate, each exercising governance powers, but not establishing an Examination Yuan, to show that it is different from the five-Yuan system. A Senate will be established separately, similar to the Japanese Privy Council and the American Senate. Any treaty and important laws cannot take effect without the approval of the Senate. The Senate will be composed of Japanese, Han, Manchu, and Mongolian people. The candidates for the President of the State Council are internally determined to be Zang Shiyi, and the leaders of the Senate are rumored to be Yuan Jinkai, Luo Zhenyu, and Zhang Jinghui. Representatives from the three northeastern provinces are gathering in Shenyang to plan the establishment of a new state, which will be realized soon. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e26">A Sincere Admonition to the Government and the People <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Those discussing national salvation today all crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, hoping and praying for the cooperation of the three leaders, Wang, Hu, and Chiang, so that they can solidify the political center. However, the more ardent the public's hope, the more the three leaders consistently claim illness, recuperation, and lofty detachment, as if the nation could perish and the race could be exterminated, but the misunderstandings and resentment among them are absolutely impossible to resolve. Because of the three leaders' unwillingness to cooperate, the political obstacles and restraints are increasing. The new government not only deeply feels the pain of having no leading figure, but also is deeply aware of the exhaustion of coping with enemies secretly entrenched on all sides. People are anxious, and the situation is chaotic. Since the establishment of the new government, the crisis has been increasing day by day. Who is doing this? Who is causing this? If this continues, what will ultimately become of the nation's affairs?</p>
<p>When Chiang had not yet resigned from the chairmanship, he often showed the whole country his determination to be responsible to the end, to exert himself wholeheartedly, and to die in the line of duty. He handled all affairs of state and did not avoid hardship and resentment. His willingness to take responsibility and not fear difficulties was highly regarded by public opinion at the time. Now, although he has left the chairmanship due to changes in the political situation, the nation is in danger, and the people's lives are in misery. After three years in power, the result is like this. How can he shed his responsibility simply by leaving the chairmanship? If he claims to be tired of politics, this is definitely not the time to make a lofty gesture. If he claims to be avoiding someone more capable, this is not the time to retreat. If leaving the chairmanship means that responsibility is also completely shed, then is it necessary to hold the chairmanship to be able to serve the country? The flames of war in Western Liaoning are becoming increasingly urgent, the borders are shrinking day by day, and the country is like a pile of eggs. Who planted the seeds of evil that led to this evil result? Although the scenery of Fenghua is beautiful, the country is full of difficulties. How can I not feel guilty to the gods when I alone enjoy myself?</p>
<p>As for Wang and Hu, they were originally the key figures advocating the reorganization of the government. Now that the government has been reorganized, the first step has been achieved. At this time, they should rush to the capital to resolutely take on the heavy responsibility of resisting foreign aggression and saving the nation. What will be accomplished by constantly claiming illness? Even if the claims of illness are true, why can't they force themselves to enter the capital, choose a quiet place to recuperate, and thereby comfort the people and stabilize the public sentiment? Moreover, when Hu was in Beijing before, his blood pressure was also high. He could stay in Beijing before, so why is it so difficult now that he must stay in Guangdong and Shanghai, viewing entering Beijing as a path of dread? They advocated reorganizing the old government, but they cannot consolidate the new government. They accused others of misleading the country and failing the people. What is the reality today? After disappointment, the people are naturally unable to tolerate those who make empty words and deceive others.</p>
<p>Moreover, the other leaders today are all making excuses for Wang, Hu, and Chiang's absence, each shirking their responsibilities, as if this is not their business and they cannot do anything about it. Those who are concerned about the times only sigh, those who seek temporary ease muddle along, and those who are unscrupulous take advantage of the chaos to satisfy their selfish desires, constantly working to distribute and seize power and positions. With a government that sighs, seeks temporary ease, and fights for power, Jinzhou fell after Liaoning and Jilin, and Rehe is in danger after Jinzhou. The whole country is silent, staring blankly, waiting for the enemy to wield the knife and slaughter us, unable to cope. Perhaps they even think that it is Jinzhou that has fallen, and it is still far away from here, so there is no need to panic and disturb themselves. Looking around, the people's hearts are dead. Alas, can our country really be called an organized nation?</p>
<p>Since the Kuomintang took power five years ago, the people have given them the opportunity to govern. It cannot be said to be too short. In the past five years, the country's affairs have deteriorated day by day, and the people's livelihood has become increasingly difficult. Until today, it is even more precarious. Those who are responsible for this mistake in running the country should be the entire Kuomintang. In today's critical situation, what else can the Kuomintang leaders say except to turn over a new leaf, unite sincerely, accept the public opinion of the people, and work together to resist foreign aggression, save the nation, determine national policies, and revitalize the people's livelihood? If they cannot do this, then they should return the national power to the people and give the people the opportunity to save themselves and the nation. After five years of misleading the country to this point, we will definitely not allow them to mislead it again.</p>
<p>As for the people, they should be thoroughly aware today that the country is not privately owned by the Kuomintang, nor is it privately owned by a few leaders such as Wang, Hu, and Chiang. The country is in danger to this point, and yet they only hope and pray that the government and a few leaders will save the country and the people. This is as foolish and shameful as the government only hoping and praying that the League of Nations will provide us with assistance. People who are insightful have repeatedly said this before. Only with responsible citizens can there be a responsible government. All the people of the country have turned a deaf ear to national affairs, allowing a few people to take them as private property, leading to today's crisis. This is all self-inflicted. How can we blame others? From now on, the people of the country should wake up and rather rely on themselves than rely on the government. Only the power of the people themselves is the most real and the most great. Saving the country and saving oneself is the most effective. We are facing this critical moment of survival. We should resolutely rise up. The country belongs to all of us citizens. The responsibility of saving the country should be borne by all of us citizens. If the government cannot resist foreign aggression and save the nation, then the final effective and powerful actions of hope and waiting should be necessary and unavoidable. Sun Tzu said, "Place them in a deadly position, and then they will live." We are now truly facing a deadly position. Will we live, or will we simply sit and wait for death? We should know how to choose for ourselves.</p>

<p>▲Paris, 11th - The Ministers of the French Cabinet all resigned to Premier Laval today, so that Laval can reorganize the cabinet or resign to the President and form a new cabinet. Since the death of Minister of War Maginot and the resignation of Foreign Minister Briand due to illness, the French Cabinet has had to change course. Laval's cabinet has lasted for over a year, which is the longest-lasting cabinet since the Poincaré cabinet.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 12th - The ministers have all made their positions available to Premier Laval to allow Laval to negotiate with leaders of various parties to form a mixed cabinet. Today's cabinet meeting unanimously decided that the Lausanne reparations conference and the Geneva disarmament conference are about to open. At this time, the formation of a mixed cabinet can facilitate everything. However, the ministers making their positions available to the Premier does not mean they have resigned. Before today's cabinet meeting, Premier Laval visited the resigned Foreign Minister Briand and then met with President Doumer. Laval later stated at the cabinet meeting that he and Briand completely agreed on all issues.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, San Francisco, 11th - Today, the Immigration Bureau of Angel Island is overcrowded with Chinese, half of whom have been expelled from Mexico and half of whom are overseas Chinese repatriated from the United States. Among them, 425 people are scheduled to board ships on the 15th of this month to be sent back to China. The remaining will be deported in batches thereafter. The anti-Chinese sentiment in Mexico has been going on for several months and has not abated. Several weeks ago, the situation became increasingly dangerous. The homes and shops of Chinese overseas Chinese were attacked by Mexican mobs. The Chinese fled in panic and rushed into the American border. The American authorities therefore specially ordered that the expelled Chinese be allowed to temporarily enter the American territory, but after transit, they can only proceed to the ocean port to wait for ships to return home.</p>

<p>Caused by the Murder of a Local by a U.S. Naval Officer</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Washington, 11th - The American government is extremely concerned about the anti-American sentiment that is currently erupting in Hawaii. Senator McKeller, a Democrat from Tennessee, has submitted a bill to the Senate requesting a thorough investigation of the case. The case was caused by a local resident of Honolulu raping the wife of U.S. Naval Officer Massie. The perpetrator was arrested by the authorities and released shortly thereafter. Many U.S. naval officers, believing that the law was insufficient to protect the safety of the wives and daughters of U.S. naval officers, automatically arrested the perpetrator and shot him to death in the bathtub, letting him bleed to death in the water. This aroused public outrage among the Hawaiian people, leading to racial resentment. Currently, U.S. Supreme Court Justice McGill has begun investigating the disturbances in Honolulu at the request of the House Naval Affairs Committee.</p>

<p>Separation from or Integration with India is Up to the Burmese to Choose</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 12th - At the final meeting of the Burmese Round Table Conference today at St. James's Palace, Prime Minister MacDonald announced the British government's policy on Burma's future constitutional status, stating that when the British government learns that Burma wishes to separate from India, it will proceed to entrust a responsible government to Burma, a bicameral legislative assembly representing the Burmese people, with certain restrictions. Any agreement formed by half elected and half governor appointed members must be approved by the British Parliament. The Prime Minister also mentioned the situation in India, stating that Britain will never abandon its responsibility for governing India.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, London, 12th - The Burmese Round Table Conference concluded today. British Prime Minister MacDonald delivered a speech lasting 40 minutes.

If Burma separates from India, the Burmese will have a constitution and can exercise broad powers, including national defense, foreign affairs, and financial management.

<p>Bombay Business Comes to a Standstill</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Pune, 12th - The authorities are racking their brains to figure out how to deal with Gandhi. Today, they came up with a new method to have him swear an oath and allow him to live alone temporarily without contact with others. However, it is questionable whether this plan can resolve Gandhi's future. Those guarding Gandhi in prison all call Gandhi a perfectly good prisoner, but Gandhi has a slight quirk. He is not flexible with food. He must see the goat's milk taken. Therefore, the goat must be brought into the prison cell before taking the milk. He was allowed to have a haircut by the prison barber, but he is very particular about the razor. Therefore, the prison authorities specially purchased a razor for his use.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Bombay, 11th - The General Cotton Brokers Association passed a resolution yesterday to advise the Indian people not to allow cash to be transferred out of their jobs, and those from scattered Indian countries should not be allowed to transfer it into the local financial sector.

Although the cotton, gold, and silver industries here are still open, there is no transaction. It is heard that someone intends to find a way to open and close each trading place only one day each week in order to calculate arrears.</p>

<p>But Advocate for a National Vote</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 12th - The German National Socialist organization of Hitler and German Prime Minister Brüning both urgently want President Hindenburg to stay in office. However, Brüning advocates that Parliament keep Hindenburg in office, while Hitler opposes it. Hitler and Nationalist Party leader Hugenberg have the same opinion on this matter and have decided not to support the extension of the President's term by Parliament. It is heard that these two will send a letter to Brüning stating that they very much want President Hindenburg to stay in office, but this should be elected by the people's vote, not by the government's proposed method. Although the Nationalist Party and the National Socialist Party both do not support the extension of the President's term by Parliament, if Hindenburg declares his intention to run for office again when his term expires in May of this year, they will definitely support him. At that time, Hindenburg will definitely get a majority of votes, because at present, all parties except the Communist Party do not want to nominate others to compete with Hindenburg.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 12th - Dr. Hugenberg of the Nationalist Party sent a letter to Prime Minister Brüning stating that if the party accepts the government's proposal to extend President Hindenburg's term, it is equivalent to expressing confidence in the policies that the party opposes, especially the current government's foreign policy. In fact, if the government resigns, the German political situation can be strengthened.</p>

At the suggestion of Moreau, President of the Bank of France, the Clearing Bank unanimously rejected an unconditional extension. The loan totals US$25 million. The German Finance Minister protested against the unconditional extension, saying that if</p>

<p>such a resolution were made, he feared that the German currency would be adversely affected. But the public replied that this responsibility should be borne by the German government. Thereupon, the view of the French representative, Moreau, was endorsed by the entire body. It was said that this resolution was a warning to the German government. The Clearing Bank then made another resolution: the German national debt would be extended for three months under certain conditions. The loans extended by the British, French, and American banks must be of the same amount. This resolution has the appearance of France fiscally restraining Germany. Moreau, the President of the Bank of France, initially stated that even with conditions, the Bank of France was unwilling to extend its loans for more than one month. After discussion, this resolution was finally made.</p>

<p>Relief for Domestic Industry</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 11th - The Senate today approved the establishment of a central financial corporation with a capital of US$2 billion. President Hoover proposed this plan to use government funds to assist national industries. Recently, due to the economic depression, it has been impossible to obtain loans from ordinary financial institutions, even with very sound guarantees. The establishment of this financial corporation is intended to address this situation by lending large sums to agricultural and other lending institutions to expand the convenience of financial circulation. Although the railway industry is currently in a stable situation, it also needs cash to get through this emergency period, so the railway industry can also use this company. The Senate Banking and Currency Committee reported on the general financial situation, saying that many banks are now in danger, some have run out of funds, and some are unable to raise funds, so the establishment of a financial corporation is necessary.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Telegram - All newspaper offices should be aware that the duty of soldiers lies in protecting the country and defending the people, and revolutionary soldiers bear the mission of revolutionary nation-building. It has been one year since the founding of the Republic of China, but the people's suffering remains the same, and the country's weakness remains the same. In terms of internal affairs, the communists run rampant, and the people have nowhere to die. In terms of national defense, strong neighbors invade, and land is lost in a short time. To this day, the communist bandits have ravaged Jiangxi and Fujian, and the embers have become a prairie fire. Jin and Yu have been swallowed up, and the enemy's atmosphere is about to charge into the inner chambers. If we revolutionary soldiers do not unite in time and overcome difficulties together, I fear that we will start with revolutionary nation-building and end with revolutionary national destruction. Even if we are laughed at by future generations, how will we face the martyrs in the ground? Alas, when the Liao and Jin invaded, the Song dynasty perished. When Zhang and Li raised their banners, the Ming dynasty collapsed. History repeats itself. Speaking of this, I am filled with fear. I hope that our revolutionary comrades will rise up together, chant the poems of brothers defending against insults, and cherish the friendship of sharing weapons and fighting against a common enemy. With our iron blood, we will serve as the country's shield and fortress. We will punish the Japanese invaders with the determination of destroying the cooking pots and sinking the boats. We will eliminate the red bandits with the plan of cutting grass and eradicating roots. All the officers and soldiers of our First and Fourth Army Corps, as well as the Navy and Air Force, have been immersed in the teachings of the late Premier for many years, and are well able to distinguish between right and wrong, understand advantages and disadvantages, recognize the times, and know themselves and the enemy. We firmly believe that today's suppression of the communists and resistance against Japan is an urgent and essential plan to seek survival in death. No matter how difficult the environment may be, we will never hesitate or wait and see. We are now actively preparing and awaiting the central government's dispatch, vowing to do our utmost to eliminate the red bandits and recover the lost territories, so as to show the spirit of our Chinese nation to the world. The survival of the Party and the nation depends on this one move. I hope that all our compatriots, comrades, and fellow soldiers across the country will rise up together to plan for it. Urgent words, respectfully submitted for your public review.

<h3 id="e69">Japanese Troops Forcibly Occupy Beining Railway <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲ Section Chiefs and Station Masters Replaced by Employees of the South Manchuria Railway</p>
<p>▲ Through Traffic to Guan Nei Limited to Shanhaiguan</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the capture of Jinzhou, Japanese troops have continued to advance to Suizhong, seeking to connect with the Japanese troops stationed in Shanhaiguan. The Chinese troops at the forefront are the 9th Brigade under He Zhuguo, stationed in Guan Nei. A few days ago, Brigade Commander He, fearing further attacks by the Japanese troops, specifically discussed the matter with the Japanese commander stationed in Shanhaiguan and went to Suizhong together to declare to the Japanese troops that the Chinese troops had completely withdrawn to Guan Nei and that there was no need for further military action. He Zhuguo is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy and is proficient in Japanese. After this negotiation, the situation seemed to ease slightly. In fact, since the Chinese troops had already withdrawn, the Japanese troops had no targets for hostility. However, the Beining Railway, from Beiping to Shenyang, a total length of over 843 kilometers, takes 21 and a half hours to reach its destination. Shanhaiguan is conveniently located at the midpoint of Beining. Since the September 18th Incident last year, although the section outside the pass has been able to reach Huanggu Tun, in fact, all freight and passenger traffic has decreased by eighty or ninety percent. According to the railway's statistics, the loss from transportation alone exceeds 5 million yuan in three months. Other losses, such as the damage from Japanese artillery fire and bombs, are not included. After Jinzhou was captured, through traffic on the section outside the pass was completely suspended again. During the height of the war, most of the employees at the stations felt their lives were in danger and returned to Tianjin. The railway bureau, considering that the railway was related to international transportation and had British investment, could not allow the Japanese troops to ravage it, so it sent Mr. Stealey (British), head of the Motive Power Department, and foreign employee Baker to the front to negotiate with the Japanese troops, intending to discuss ways to resume traffic and ordered the employees who had returned to Tianjin to return to their original posts outside the pass. The Japanese troops did not allow it. It is now heard that the Japanese side has taken over the trunk and branch lines of the Beining section outside the pass in the name of the puppet Northeast Transportation Committee and has renamed the section outside the pass the Shanfeng Railway. In addition to transferring Kan Duo, Director of the Siping-Taonan Railway Bureau, to serve as Director of the Shanfeng Bureau, the section chiefs and station masters of each section have also been appointed and replaced by employees of the South Manchuria Railway. The railway signs have also been changed. The special train sent by the railway bureau here to repair telegraphs and telephones only reached Suizhong yesterday (the 9th). Beyond this point, it was stopped by the Japanese troops and could not proceed. In addition, all the telephone and telegraph machines at the stations outside the pass were taken away by the Japanese troops after this major destruction by the Japanese troops. Each station along the route has twenty or thirty Japanese soldiers stationed. It is also heard that the Japanese troops have also sent engineering teams to repair the damaged sections along the way by a deadline, preparing to open traffic on the section from Shenyang to Shanhaiguan. The Japanese intention to destroy China's transportation industry and forcibly seize the rights of the Beining Railway is already very clear. (January 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Abolition of the Guangzhou National Government <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>▲ Extraordinary Conference to End Before the 15th</p>
<p>▲ The Southwest Executive Department and Other Organizations Are Quite Simple</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the unified government was established, the mission of the Guangzhou National Government has been completed and there is no need for it to exist. It was officially abolished on New Year's Day this year by sending a telegram. However, after the abolition, the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou will still be followed. The Southwest Executive Department of the Central Executive Committee will be established, and at the same time, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the Southwest Military Branch will be established as three institutions to preside over the important political, military, and party affairs of the Southwest. As for the Central Party Headquarters, which was previously in Guangdong, it has been gradually closing down and is required to complete the closure before the 15th of this month. From the 6th to the 15th of this month, working hours will be increased, so all staff must arrive at the department at 8:00 a.m. every day and will not be dismissed until 8:00 p.m. They will also dine in the department. During the closure period, they may not go out without permission. From this, we can see the busyness of rushing to complete the closure. As for the members of the Southwest Executive Department of the Central Party Headquarters and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, they have successively taken office. A joint meeting was held on the 5th to discuss various ongoing cases. At 10:00 a.m. on the 6th, another joint meeting was held in the National Government conference hall. Those present included Deng Zhiru, Xiao Focheng, Chen Jitang, Liu Jiwen, Lin Yizhong, Li Xiaosheng, Qu Fangpu, Yang Xiji, and more than ten others. Xiao Focheng presided over the meeting. There was a detailed discussion on the organization of the Southwest Executive Department and the Military Branch, and various items of the Political Affairs Committee. The results of the discussion were as follows: (1) The organizational regulations of the Southwest Executive Department of the Central Party Headquarters were adopted. (2) The organizational regulations of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee were adopted. (3) The principles for the recurring expenses of the above two institutions were determined. In addition, the distribution of new agency staff and the resettlement of comrades who opposed Chiang Kai-shek were decided. The organization of the Southwest Military Branch was largely discussed on that day, but no specific decision was made. The organization of the Southwest Executive Department of the Central Party Headquarters and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee is quite simple. The Executive Department has a Secretariat and an Organization Group, a Publicity Group, and an Overseas Party Affairs Group, which are reorganized from the original Secretariat and three committees of the Central Party Headquarters. The Political Affairs Committee has several departments to manage various political affairs. The institutions of the various provinces in the Southwest that are related to the committee are all under the supervision and command of the committee. The affairs of the above two committees are handled by the Standing Committee members of each committee. (January 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Shantou Party-Student Turmoil Escalates <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>▲ All Schools Completely Strike</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Last year, students in Shantou City had a dispute with the city party headquarters, which led to the suspension of the Anti-Japanese Association and affected the work of resisting Japan and saving the country. The student side insisted that primary school students had the freedom to participate in saving the country and demanded punishment of those suspected of corruption in the former Anti-Japanese Association, as well as a thorough investigation of the China and Foreign Cotton Mill, etc. The party headquarters insisted on severely punishing the students who caused trouble during the patrol on the 15th and preserving the authority of the party. Both sides went to extremes, and the turmoil intensified day by day. The party headquarters of Chaoyang, Chenghai, Chaoan, and Huilai counties have sent telegrams in support of the Shantou City party headquarters. Primary and secondary schools in various counties have also risen up to support the students in Shantou City. The Shantou City Student National Salvation Association has resolved to implement a strike from December 30th and wait for the higher authorities to issue clear instructions. At the same time, it will send personnel to various counties to establish joint associations of student anti-Japanese national salvation in various counties. On the afternoon of the 31st, a strike picket group was formed at the Commercial College. The group stipulated nine members, divided into general affairs, documents, pickets, team leaders, etc., and selected students from the student associations of nine schools, including Gao Zhuan, No. 1 Middle School, Girls' Middle School, Youlian, Lan, Yu Huai, Zhongying, and Minqiang, to jointly organize it. On New Year's Day this year, student teams paraded and promoted anti-Japanese sentiment, and posted slogans. The city party headquarters also posted slogans to eliminate all reactionaries. Now both sides have fortified their positions, and it is not known how to resolve it. (January 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Bandits Withdraw from Huangpi <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>▲ Li Mingzhong Resigns as Border Area Pacification Commissioner</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Kuang Jizhu's department of the Fourth Army of the Red Bandits, with all its strength, captured Huang'an this time and attacked Huangpi, almost threatening Wuhan. It destroyed the Pinghan Railway. He Chengjing, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, seeing the rampant banditry, specially dispatched heavy troops to suppress and encircle them in various directions. Xu Tingyao's 11th and 12th Brigades of the Fourth Division were responsible for the front, attacking from Hengdian. Xia Douyin's 13th Division and Xiao Zhichu's 44th Division were responsible for the flanks. Xia's division attacked from Qijiawan, and Xiao's division attacked from Zhujiawan. In addition, the 48th Division's Han Changjun Brigade was responsible for the rear, attacking from Xinjie, Hekou, and Changqu. The 4th Aviation Team dispatched two aircraft to bomb everywhere. The railway artillery team dispatched the 9th Team to patrol the railway. Xu Tingyao was also sent to the front line to supervise the troops. All troops, aircraft, and artillery vehicles were temporarily placed under his command. Xu departed on the 6th and, after arriving at Hengdian, immediately ordered a general offensive. The fighting was fierce on the 6th, 7th, and 8th. The bandits suffered heavy losses due to being attacked from three sides and retreated north. Although the bandits retreated north, they still gathered in large numbers in Changxuanling and Yanzi Gang and built solid fortifications. They could retreat for a long time and then attack again. When Xu's division and Han's brigade launched from Xinjie, Hekou, and Changyan, the bandit army was attacked from both sides and felt increasingly unable to support itself, so it decided to withdraw from Huang'an and, if necessary, flee into Henan Province or detour around northern Hubei and join forces with He Long. It was heard that the withdrawal began on the 9th and was completed by the 11th. The various armies that suppressed and encircled the bandits returned to their garrisons after the bandits had fled far away. Xu Tingyao's division returned to Wuhan completely on the 11th and was stationed in Wuchang and Hankou's Qinjiaji. Huangpi County Town is still defended by Li Mingzhong's 30th Division. It is said that the local area is safe and order has been completely restored. After Li's troops recovered Qiliping in Huang'an last year, they repeatedly confronted the bandits. Now is the time to encourage morale and take the opportunity to attack the bandit dens again, so as to permanently eliminate the bandit scourge in the border area of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. Unexpectedly, Li suddenly claimed that his lung disease had recurred and that it was difficult to perform his duties. On the 10th, he telegraphed He Yingqin, Minister of Military Administration, and Zhu Peide, Chief of Staff, asking them to request the National Government to relieve him of his duties as Pacification Commissioner of the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Area and concurrently as Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Eastern Hubei, in order to recuperate. Although Li himself went to Huangpi on the 11th to await orders, he still used the 30th Division Commander to search and suppress the remaining bandits, but his attitude was passive, and it was feared that sweeping the dens and plowing the courtyards would not be possible in a short time. It has been found that there are as many as 40,000 bandits remaining in Hubei Province. The damage suffered in Huangpi this time was only part of Xu Xiangqian's force. The main force of the Kuang bandits was not greatly damaged, and it is difficult to avoid a resurgence. (January 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Northwest Flight Success <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>▲ No. 1 Aircraft Returns to Beiping from Tianshan</p>
<p>▲ Li Jingcong Talks About the Flight Experience</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Eurasia No. 1 aircraft, which was test-flying in the Northwest, returned east the day before yesterday after arriving in Dihua on the 22nd of last month. It stopped at Ruoshui River that night and took off from Ruoshui River yesterday morning (the 9th), passing through Suiyuan without stopping. It flew to Nanyuan, Beiping at 4:25 p.m. The Northwest trip was thus a success. The aircraft is scheduled to be taken by Li Jingcong and others tomorrow to Nanjing and then to Shanghai. After Li reported the test flight to the company, he immediately began to plan the official opening of the route. Yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m., after Li and others returned to the city, the reporter visited the Eurasia Company office. Li kindly talked about his flight experience as follows: [</p>
<p>At 7 a.m. on the 20th of last month, I, along with pilot Luz, Stonemide, Shi Berlin, and others, departed from Nanyuan in the No. 1 aircraft. At 10 a.m., we arrived at Guihua. After stopping to refuel, we flew to Ruoshui River. It was already dusk, and we searched everywhere for the place where we had agreed to place gasoline but could not find it. We circled in the air for about an hour. It was already dark, and we had no choice but to land in an ancient city. The city is named Heichengzi and was built in the Han Dynasty. It has now been buried and no one knows about it. There were no possessions in the city. We curled up in the aircraft. We fired our guns late at night, but no one responded. We could not even hear the sound of dogs. The next day, we waited until noon, but no one came. So we flew up again and discovered a herd of camels in the air. We landed to ask the camel riders and were able to find the place where the gasoline was placed. It was already past noon, and it was too late to fly to Dihua, so we spent another night in Ruoshui River. On the morning of the 22nd, we flew west and safely arrived in Dihua at 2 p.m. At that time, representatives of the Xinjiang Provincial Government and many people had arrived at the scene to welcome us, which was extremely enthusiastic. The whole city also hung flags to mark the celebration. We met with Chairman Jin Shuren five times in Xinjiang. Jin praised the success of the flight and was willing to do his best to help. In addition, he entrusted us to bring more than 100 catties of valuable items to his representatives in Beiping and Tianjin, Guanglu Jun, and other agency personnel. The various agencies also regarded the flight as an unprecedented event and held banquets to welcome us, so our social activities were endless. Dihua City is located north of the Tianshan Mountains. The climate has been quite cold recently. The daytime temperature is below 15 degrees Celsius, and the nighttime temperature is below 20 or 30 degrees Celsius. The city gates close at 4 p.m. every day, and the night is unusually cold. The people there only know news from the interior from two or three months ago. The Beiping and Tianjin newspapers are transported to the area by the Siberian Railway, which takes a month and a half. Those transported from the interior take three months. This time, we brought the Beiping and Tianjin newspapers from the 19th of last month, and the people there treated them as rare treasures, praising them as opening a new era of culture. The local newspaper, Tianshan Daily, only published news from two or three months ago. Now that they had the newspapers we brought, they reprinted as much as possible. Until yesterday, when we left Xinjiang, the newspaper was still using materials from the Beiping and Tianjin newspapers from the 19th. It is a pity that I was unable to bring back a few copies. We originally planned to test-fly to Yili and Tacheng in Dihua, but then temporarily cancelled it. Since we had already stayed in Xinjiang for more than ten days, we decided to return east yesterday morning. We departed at 7 a.m. and arrived at Ruoshui River at 4 p.m., where we spent the night. We took off from Ruoshui River at 7:30 this morning, passed through Guihua without landing, and went straight to Nanyuan. This trip was a risky attempt because we were completely unfamiliar with the geography. The result was that we measured the distance from Beiping to Ruoshui River to be 1,400 kilometers, and the distance from Ruoshui River to Dihua to be 1,200 kilometers, a total of 2,600 kilometers. There were more high mountains along the way than plains. The flight altitude was about 700-800 meters and 2,000-3,000 meters. But we arrived safely and on time, which is gratifying. I am scheduled to take the same aircraft to Nanjing and then to Shanghai the day after tomorrow to report the test flight to the company, so as to prepare for the official opening of the route.] (January 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Chambers of Commerce in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province Request Amendments to the Business Tax Rectification Measures <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Representatives from the chambers of commerce of various counties in Jiangsu Province went to the Provincial Government's Finance Department on the morning of the 11th to personally submit a petition, requesting the cessation of business tax rectification measures that contain clauses that harass merchants. Chairman Gu and Director Shu of the Finance Department were in Shanghai to discuss the Grand Canal project, so Jin Tigan and Cheng Botang received the representatives separately and promised to forward the petition. The petition is recorded below: [Since the central government abolished likin (internal transit tax), local governments, in order to compensate for the reduced revenue due to the abolition of likin, have implemented business taxes. This measure is a last resort for the provincial governments and is understood by all merchants. However, since its implementation, the chambers of commerce have repeatedly gathered to discuss and request changes to the collection methods, as they are not conducive to business, but these requests have not been adopted by the Provincial Government's Finance Department. As a result, business conditions have not been harmonious, and the measures are largely unsuitable, leading to poor revenue collection after half a year. This is partly due to the impact of floods and financial problems, but also to a lack of communication and cooperation between officials and the public. Now, the provincial government, due to a shortage of tax revenue, has specially formulated thirteen articles for rectification, with the original intention of increasing tax revenue and allowing the provincial treasury to have sufficient funds for operation, which should still be understood by merchants. However, after careful analysis of the articles, the chambers of commerce feel that they are even more incompatible with business conditions and are sufficient to cause harassment, and they violate the regulations of the Ministry of Finance's amended articles, which is unacceptable to merchants. Therefore, we specifically enumerate the following points: For example, Article 5 of the rectification measures states, "This investigation should be entrusted to the bureaus to send personnel to fill out the declaration forms household by household." Article 6 states, "For stores that use business volume as the standard, they should present their business ledgers for the 20th year of the Republic of China during the investigation. For stores that use capital amount as the standard, they should present their business contract documents during the investigation. Those who do not comply with the investigation and presentation will have their ledgers and contracts retrieved and reviewed by the Review Committee for a decision." The above two articles stipulate that, on the one hand, the bureaus should be entrusted to send personnel, and on the other hand, ledgers and contracts should be presented during the investigation, without regard for the provisions of Article 6 of the Ministry of Finance's amended regulations. Article 6 of the Ministry of Finance's amendment stipulates that the collection agency may, when necessary, send personnel to investigate and inspect ledgers, documents, and goods, but must do so in conjunction with the local chamber of commerce. The essence of this article is that everyone knows that sending personnel to investigate and inspect is a method that the collection agency can adopt when necessary, and it is not that the bureaus can send personnel to investigate and inspect at any time or when it is not necessary. Furthermore, even if the collection agency sends personnel to investigate and inspect when necessary, it must do so in conjunction with the local chamber of commerce. This proviso shows that investigation must be done in conjunction with the chamber of commerce. In other words, even if the bureaus want to carry out the investigation independently, they cannot do so. Even according to the Business Tax Law passed by the Legislative Yuan, it only stipulates that businesses should declare the amount of capital and business, and only when the provincial or municipal government considers it inaccurate can the Review Committee review it. The organization of the Review Committee is even more clearly stipulated, that the review committee members representing the interests of taxpayers should not be less than one-third of the total number of committee members. This further shows that the bureaus cannot independently and arbitrarily investigate and inspect. This is the first point that the Department should request to abolish according to the Ministry's regulations and the Business Tax Law. Another example is Article 8 of the rectification measures, "Wholesale and retail are taxed separately," which is not permitted by the Business Tax Law and should be collected uniformly from the 21st year of the Republic of China according to regulations. The Business Tax Law is the general outline stipulated by the central government. As for the detailed implementation rules, the competent officials should supplement them based on the actual situation. Since the Business Tax Law does not stipulate that wholesale and retail must be uniformly treated, and according to the actual situation, the nature of retail and wholesale is indeed different, it is necessary to collect them separately. Moreover, does not the Business Tax Law clearly stipulate in Article 1 of the new measures that the implementation will be postponed again from January of next year? What is shown to the merchants is the postponement of implementation, so it should not be considered whether the Business Tax Law permits it or not. Furthermore, the phrase "collected uniformly from the 21st year of the Republic of China according to regulations" is unclear as to which regulations it refers to, making it impossible to follow. Moreover, Article 14 of the Ministry of Finance's amended regulations has clearly stipulated that wholesale can be taxed at half the business tax rate. It is absolutely clear that separate taxation of wholesale and retail is permitted by Article 14 of the Ministry of Finance's amended regulations. In addition, Article 1 of the new rectification measures passed by the provincial government clearly admits that the tax rates will still be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance. Since it is said that the regulations of the Ministry of Finance will still be followed, then wholesale and retail should be taxed separately, and wholesale should be taxed at half the rate. Why is it ambiguous and said that it will be "collected uniformly according to regulations," which violates the regulations of the Ministry of Finance? Furthermore, Article 10 of the new measures states, "Since the tax rate is temporarily unchanged, it should be collected in accordance with the original tax rate set by the Ministry of Finance, and no further reduction or circumvention is allowed." It is true that merchants should not be allowed to reduce or circumvent taxes at will, but why can the government freely change or increase the measures it has set in relation to the original regulations of the Ministry of Finance? The above are the important points in the rectification measures that violate the regulations of the Ministry of Finance and contradict the regulations, and should be abolished. This is the second point. Furthermore, Article 13 of the rectification measures states, "The bureau staff who collect taxes can extract 20% of the extra revenue as a reward." Using the surplus or deficit of tax collection as the standard for reward and punishment is originally the general policy of the likin era. Moreover, business tax can only be collected according to the reported amount. Unless there is arbitrary exaction, there is no possibility of extra revenue. The provision of this article is tantamount to opening the door to corruption and harassment, and should be abolished. This is the third point. The above only lists a few points in the new measures that violate the regulations of the Ministry of Finance and are difficult for merchants to agree to. We urgently request the government to suspend the implementation of these measures and convene a meeting of all provincial chambers of commerce within the shortest possible time to properly discuss rectification methods, so as to comply with the principle of public finance. The government's aim is to rectify provincial tax revenue, while the merchants' aim is to protect their own interests. If they can sit together and deliberate carefully, there will be no situation where both cannot be taken into consideration. The chambers of commerce have researched in detail and have the same opinion. We hereby jointly submit this petition for your review and approval. We are filled with anticipation and await your command.]</p>

<p>The Third Public Security Bureau Cracks a Female Bandit Case Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Xuezhu is currently investigating the kidnapping case of Fan Xuetai's family in the 14th district. The investigation has revealed that the case is related to the wanted bandit Zhen Xianglin. The chief led patrol leader Zhou Zhaonan to search on the night of the previous day. Unexpectedly, when they arrived near where the bandit was hiding, they suddenly saw two people, a man and a woman, entering the house from outside. Upon hearing the sound of footsteps, they turned around and asked who it was. Seeing that the situation was not good, Chief Chen ordered his team to step forward and open fire. The bandit was very alert and, realizing that something was wrong, immediately fled outside Qin Gongtang. As a result, only the bandit's concubine, Chen Linshi, and a Type 13 Box Cannon were captured. The male bandit who escaped is the concubine's younger brother, named Lin Asi. Chief Chen has already escorted the female bandit to the county seat for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<p>Record of the Interrogation of the Ganpu Kidnapping Case After the Xu Liqiao Security Corps cracked the Ganpu small kidnapping case of Chen Shunguan on the night of the 9th in Bizheng Township, about three miles from the town, they handed the case over to the county government for trial yesterday. According to the kidnapper Lu Xingsheng, he suffered losses in the flower business and switched to farming. Last month, a relative named Gu Alang asked him to wait for a job in Songjiang. After waiting for many days, he was asked to row a boat to Ganpu. There were a total of four sailing boats, with about three to four hundred people. They kidnapped more than thirty people and divided the spoils in Taihu Lake. He was asked to take care of this child, with the promise that he would receive a large sum of money after the child was redeemed. However, because he had many family members, he entrusted his aunt Yuan Lushi to foster the child. Yuan Lushi, however, consistently denied knowing anything. In addition to telegraphing the case to the provincial government for instructions, County Magistrate Shen has temporarily handed the kidnapped child, Chen Shunguan, to the Nanqiao Orphanage for proper care, pending identification.</p>

<p>Patrol Police Detain Suspicious Persons Due to the frequent theft cases in various districts of the city during the winter prevention period, the military and police authorities ordered strict patrols to prevent problems. Last night (the 11th), three strangers were lurking in the dark in the third district. Upon seeing them, the patrol police went forward to question them. According to their statements, one was Gao Zihe from Hunan, wearing a symbol indicating that he was a soldier in the mortar company of the 20th regiment of the 10th brigade of the 4th division of the army. Another was Gao Jifu from Shandong, who was on leave from the 2nd guard brigade to return to his hometown and planned to go to Shanghai. The third was Mei Bozhi, also from Hunan, who was a water police soldier in Jiaxing and had deserted. The rest of their statements were evasive. The patrol police, considering their suspicious behavior, immediately detained them and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Gunfire in the Middle of the Night Around 9 p.m. on the 10th, residents in the western suburbs of the city vaguely heard loud gunfire for about an hour, causing doubt and confusion. It has recently been discovered that the gunfire was due to a conflict between barge boats and Jiangbei boats in the Jinshan County area across the river from Xiaocijing. It is unknown which side fired the shots.</p>
<p>The County Party Headquarters Orders the Songbao Newspaper to Suspend Publication for Seven Days The Songbao Newspaper published two news items on December 18 of last year and on the 11th of this month, regarding the Standing Committee member being accused and the Standing Committee member Sun's enthusiastic inspection of party affairs, respectively. The County Party Headquarters believed that the newspaper deliberately slandered the Standing Committee member Sun and damaged his reputation. The 20th Executive Committee meeting decided to order the Songbao Newspaper to suspend publication for seven days as a punishment. It is reported that the Songbao Newspaper was greatly shocked after receiving the order. It believed that if the news was untrue and damaged the reputation of the Standing Committee member Sun, a lawsuit could be filed in accordance with the law and the legal solution could be accepted. It should not violate the central government's clear order to suppress public opinion. Therefore, in addition to submitting the facts to the Provincial Party Headquarters to await a solution, the newspaper continued to publish as usual.</p>

<p>The Urgent Advancement of Organizing a Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce The chambers of commerce of various counties in Jiangsu Province previously initiated the organization of a provincial federation of chambers of commerce in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law. They applied to the Provincial Party Headquarters for a permit twice, on April 7th and April 29th of last year, in order to start preparations. However, the permit has not been granted to this day. Recently, the chambers of commerce of various counties believe that the current situation is unstable, foreign aggression is increasingly urgent, and merchants really need to unite. The provincial federation of chambers of commerce is stipulated by law, and the initiating chambers of commerce of various counties exceed two-thirds of the chambers of commerce in the province. The procedures are not incomplete. During the recent meeting of representatives of the chambers of commerce of various counties in Zhenjiang regarding the business tax issue, the matter of the federation of chambers of commerce was also brought up for discussion. After unanimous agreement, it was decided to continue to submit a request to the Provincial Party Headquarters, requesting that the permit be issued immediately in order to facilitate the organization, and that all representatives personally petition to facilitate progress.</p>
<p>Five Kidnappers Escorted to Wuxi for Trial The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team arrested six criminals on the 5th of this month at the Maojia Alley Wharf in Nanshi, who kidnapped Yao Qibao, a shop assistant at the Shuntai South Goods Store in Xinan Town, the 13th district of this county, and Wang Jiannan, the owner of the Xinchang Rice Store, namely Xing Youyi, Cao Jinbiao, Pan Guoliang, Dong San, Yang Kunshan, and Duan Dekui.

<p>The Fifth Precinct Detains a Notorious Bandit Gu Guoxiang, the chairman of the Village Improvement Association in Gaochangan Township, the sixth district (Tianxia City), noticed four burly men with suspicious behavior behind his house at noon on the 9th of this month. He immediately called more than ten villagers to arrest them on the spot. The next day, he sent them to the Fifth Precinct of the Jiangyin An Public Security Bureau. After the bureau member Ji Yapin conducted a preliminary interrogation, they confessed that they were named Zhang Xiaodi, Wang Ruilin, Hu Xicheng, and Li Youlong, and that they planned to steal from a certain family. Bureau member Ji noticed that Zhang Xiaodi's feet moved sluggishly, as if he had shackles from a previous crime. He questioned him strictly, and Zhang confessed that he was a small gang leader in Taihu Lake at the end of the Qing Dynasty. He was arrested in the first year of the Republic of China for a case and imprisoned for sixteen years. After being released from prison, he was imprisoned again in the 18th year of the Republic of China for trafficking soil and sentenced to two years. Now, less than a month after his release from prison, he and Wang and the other three have joined together to steal in order to make a living. He also said that four people were currently living at the home of Zhao Guozhen at No. 7 Tongan Lane, Nancangmen. According to Ji's confession, he learned that he was a bandit from Wuxi. [Illegible Characters] went to search and arrested [Illegible Characters] and [Illegible Characters], and brought them to the bureau for temporary detention.

The next day, he received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 100,000 yuan. The contact place was Zhuji Xishen. The handwriting of the letter was that of his brother Zhengfu, so he did not take it seriously. Unexpectedly, on the 5th, the corpse floated in a pool under Xuan Shanxia. It was then known that he had been killed for ransom. Sun secretly reported to the Xiaoshan County Public Security Bureau, who rushed to arrest Sun Zhengfu, Sun Xianming, Sun Xuetang, Sun Jinyu, and Sun Youtian.

<p>▲ Decision to Organize a Special Committee</p>
<p>▲ To Cope with the Current National Crisis</p>
<p>▲ All Central Committee Members Return to Beijing This Morning Together</p>
<p>Premier Sun Ke’s trip to Fenghua was cancelled. Key figures of the central government, such as Vice Premier Chen Mingshu, Foreign Minister Chen Youren, Interior Minister Li Wenfan, Finance Minister Huang Hanliang, and Railway Minister Ye Gongchuo, left Beijing for Shanghai, causing a virtual standstill in the central political apparatus. Shanghai became the focus of the current situation. Yesterday, these key figures held an important meeting again at Sun’s residence on Molier Road to discuss emergency measures to cope with the national crisis. They decided to organize a special committee as a stopgap measure before Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and Hu Hanmin arrive in Beijing, in order to overcome the current major crises in diplomacy, finance, and military affairs. Premier Sun, believing that a solution to the current situation has been discussed, decided to return to Beijing with all the ministers this morning. Yesterday, Sun also expressed a proactive attitude of “national survival with survival, national demise with demise.”</p>
<p>▲ Establishment of a Special Committee. Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Chen Mingshu, Chen Youren, Li Wenfan, Huang Hanliang, Ye Gongchuo, Zou Lu, Feng Yuxiang, Li Jishen, Li Zongren, Wu Tiecheng, Ma Chaojun, and other key central figures held an important meeting at Sun's residence for two hours. During the meeting, Sun Ke reported on the current difficulties of the government and the tense diplomatic situation. Subsequently, everyone successively expressed their opinions, stating that at this critical moment of national crisis, they could not sit idly by as the central government remained vacant. Therefore, it was decided to establish a special committee under the Central Political Conference to cope with the current serious national issues. The members of the special committee would include Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and Hu Hanmin, the Standing Committee members of the Central Political Conference, as ex officio members, and Sun Ke, Chen Mingshu, He Yingqin, Yu Youren, Chen Youren, Feng Yuxiang, Li Jishen, Li Zongren, Zhu Peide, and nine others would be elected as members. All Central Committee members will return to Beijing today, and the Central Standing Committee meeting will be held tomorrow to formally finalize the decision.</p>
<p>▲ Sun Ke's Remarks Before Returning to Beijing. Premier Sun is scheduled to return to Beijing with all the ministers and Central Committee members at 9:30 this morning. Yesterday, he made the following remarks on the current situation: (Reporter asked) Mr. Chiang, Mr. Hu, and Mr. Wang have not yet confirmed their arrival in Beijing, and you are leaving Beijing at this time, making the central government even more vacant, leading to the standstill of all matters and causing public anxiety. You bear important entrustments from the Party and the country. How will you overcome this difficulty? I believe you have deliberated thoroughly and would like to hear your thoughts. (Answer) The national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent every day, truly an unprecedentedly difficult situation since the founding of the Republic. It cannot be salvaged without gathering the talent and strength of the entire nation. As a member of the public, and especially with a deep and long-standing historical relationship with the Chinese Nationalist Party, I cannot shirk my responsibility at this critical moment. However, considering the recent situation, if the central organs cannot be strengthened, then this kind of past responsibility of the Premier cannot be borne by me. In terms of finance, the debt burden has been mounting for several years, and all resources have been exhausted. The central government's annual revenue is originally 400 to 500 million, but after paying off debts, less than 100 million is available. If we want to issue more public bonds, the collateral has already been completely used up, and the market price of bonds is only 20 to 30 percent of their face value. Even if we forcibly issue public bonds, it will not help. Recently, the government's monthly fiscal revenue is only 6 million, while the expenditure is 18 million for military expenses alone, even after the reductions approved by the previous Finance Committee. Government expenses and education expenses still require 4 million, resulting in a shortfall of 16 million. The national finance has reached such an extreme state of difficulty that even the minimum necessary expenses for maintaining the national organization cannot be supported. This affects various issues such as diplomacy and military affairs. Even with good solutions, they are difficult to implement due to the constraints of the situation. The reason why I decided to go to Fenghua in person the other day to ask Mr. Chiang to return to Beijing quickly, and the reason why the central government also sent Mr. Yu Youren to Hong Kong to urge Mr. Hu to come north immediately, is precisely because the national crisis has reached this point. There is no other way but to do our utmost to facilitate the cooperation of the leaders. For several days in Shanghai, responsible comrades from the central government have repeatedly consulted with each other and expressed agreement with my views. All of them believe that at this time, Chinese Nationalist Party comrades must restore the spirit of revolution, and everyone is willing to sacrifice personal interests in order to address the nation's urgent needs first, and must break through the difficult situation to find a way out for the Party and the country. Before Mr. Hu, Mr. Wang, and Mr. Chiang arrive in Beijing, the central organs especially need urgent measures to strengthen them. Therefore, it was unanimously decided that all Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai will first return to Beijing tomorrow morning, and the Central Standing Committee will establish a special committee within the Central Political Conference to take full responsibility for coping with the national crisis and quickly handling various political affairs. At the same time, we will continue to urge Mr. Hu, Mr. Wang, and Mr. Chiang to come to Beijing as soon as possible to share the great responsibility. Mr. Wang has indicated that he will come to Beijing as soon as he recovers from his illness. Mr. Hu and Mr. Chiang, after such earnest appeals from comrades and the people of the country, should not be able to ignore everything and should be able to comfort the people's ardent hopes. Today is truly the autumn of life and death for the Chinese nation, and it is also the day for us to sacrifice ourselves to serve the country. I firmly believe that as long as the people of the country embrace the spirit of revolution, the affairs of the nation will definitely not be without hope. Today, all the comrades in the central government have made up their minds to share the fate of the nation and resolutely go to Beijing together to jointly take responsibility for the current situation, and there has been a turning point. I will certainly bear my share of the responsibility and will not hesitate to go through fire and water. I hope that all compatriots across the country will also share this determination and work together with the government. Regardless of diplomacy or finance, we must be the government's support. As for the civil and military officials who serve the country, they must work hard and diligently at this time and not seek personal gain. Then, a nation can be revitalized through adversity, and who knows if the enemy's disaster will not be a blessing to us. I especially hope that the news media will promote this idea to the people, so that everyone can shoulder their responsibility to save the country and not just blame the government. This is to do everything possible to save the country, which is the great fortune of the nation."</p>

He firmly believes that the political situation can develop rapidly from now on, so as to comfort the hopes of the people. The reporter also asked if he had seen Mr. Wang. He replied, "I know that the doctor advised Mr. Wang not to see guests, so I did not go. But I firmly believe that Mr. Wang will go to Beijing immediately when his illness improves slightly."</p>
<h3 id="e88">Opinions on Financial Matters After Provinces Seize Taxes <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Consolidated Tax Administration Will Send Personnel to Various Provinces for Investigation</p>
<p>▲ Deputy Finance Minister Lin Kanghou Declines to Take Office Due to the Tax Seizure Issue</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the unified government, provincial governments have suddenly taken the action of seizing customs duties and consolidated taxes, and Guangdong Province has directly collected national taxes and has not yet reported or remitted them to the central government. There are even rumors that Tianjin and other places are also withholding tax revenues. This matter is of great importance to national finance and bond credit. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency inquired with the authorities of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance and the Consolidated Tax Administration yesterday. According to the Ministry of Finance, when the unified government was not yet established, Guangdong Province had indicated that after the establishment of the government, national taxes in Guangdong Province would still be collected by the central government. However, after the unified government was established, Guangdong Province did not fulfill this commitment, and the provinces of Shandong and Fujian also followed suit. There are also confirmed plans in North China provinces to seize salt taxes, etc. Previously, the central government's tax revenue reached 30 million per month, but now it has suddenly decreased to 6 million, while the monthly military expenditure requires 18 million, and administrative and educational expenses amount to 4 million, leaving no solution. Deputy Finance Minister Lin Kanghou has therefore delayed taking office. This situation has the potential to cause the national finance to completely collapse. The reporter then visited the Consolidated Tax Administration. According to the section chief of the administration, it is a fact that various provinces are seizing consolidated taxes. This action has a significant impact on the consolidated tax treasury bond fund. Currently, Director Zou has just taken office, and everything within the department is still being reorganized. Once the reorganization is completed, personnel will be sent to various provinces for investigation and to communicate with various provincial governments.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou has not yet taken office nearly ten days after the government appointed him as the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance. Reporters specifically visited him at the Bank Association at 3 p.m. yesterday. After Mr. Lin invited them to sit down and exchanged pleasantries, they began their conversation. (Reporter asked) When will you go to Nanjing to take office? (Mr. Lin replied) I plan not to take office. (Asked) Why did you agree to take office initially? (Answer) This time, the government invited people from the public to take on national affairs. All citizens should take on this responsibility without regard to sacrifice. Moreover, the people in the current government do not agree with the policies of the previous government and want to innovate and start anew with the people. Therefore, I agreed to consider taking on the position after a definite direction was decided. (Asked) What are the reasons why you plan not to take office? (Answer) Everyone knows that the government's finances have reached a dead end. Now, to overcome the difficulties, first, the military must realize the need to reduce military spending and, at the same time, use the military to protect production; second, various provinces must maintain the central government's financial unity and not seize national taxes in order to maintain the bond fund, so that the nation's credit will not be lost and public bonds can be reissued to carry out industrial and transportation construction. However, at the beginning of the new government's establishment, Guangdong Province was the first to refuse to return the national taxes seized previously to the central government and continued to seize them. Then, Shandong and other provinces followed suit. Recently, there have been rumors that the northern provinces are also seizing customs duties and salt taxes. That is, the provinces not only do not realize the need to reduce military spending but also seize the central government's revenue, indirectly robbing the public bond fund. On the one hand, they receive salaries, and on the other hand, they seize revenue, which is no different from increasing military spending. In this situation, I believe that it is hopeless to seek financial innovation from the government. Therefore, there is no need to hold a false title and help oppress the people. (Asked) Does that mean you will not be involved in financial matters at all? (Answer) I am willing to work with the people to strive for financial innovation. The people are well aware that over the past few years, tens of thousands of yuan of public bonds have been issued and used for military expenses. Previous financial authorities have repeatedly proposed reductions, but they could not be implemented. Today, 18 million yuan is still required each month, and what the military repays to our people is only internal warfare, bandits, communists, and opium. However, the authorities still tell the people that if they want to quell internal warfare, eliminate the communists, and eliminate bandits, they must raise more military expenses; otherwise, they will not be responsible for the people's suffering. Therefore, the people squeeze out every last drop of blood and sweat to survive. How can the people survive in this situation of utter devastation? If the people of all provinces and regions do not rise up together to supervise the finances, then politics will never be clear and the national crisis cannot be saved. The reporter, seeing that Mr. Lin had many visitors, arranged for another conversation and shook hands to say goodbye.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Continued Opposition to the Seizure of National Taxes <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>▲ Banking and Money Industry Association Fund</p>
<p>▲ Sends Telegrams to Various Authorities</p>
<p>▲ Remittance of Tax Revenues to the Central Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association and the Treasury Bond Fund Custody Committee telegraphed the central government and various authorities yesterday regarding the seizure of customs duties and salt taxes by various parties, appealing to them. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Two Associations of the Banking and Money Industry</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the National Government's Executive Yuan, Nanjing. Revered Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government: Recently, news of various provinces seizing national taxes has been widely reported. If this is true, it is truly shocking. Salt and customs taxes are used to guarantee foreign debts. If there is any breach of contract, it will inevitably lead to reproaches from foreigners. At this time of national peril and urgent diplomacy, we fear that it will give enemy countries an excuse and lose the sympathy of friendly countries. The situation is very important. This is one reason why it is unacceptable from the perspective of the diplomatic situation. The way to establish a nation is to prioritize good faith. The current tobacco, alcohol, stamp, consolidated, customs, and salt taxes are all funds for public bonds and treasury bonds, which are managed by associations and recorded in regulations. If the fund is shaken, the bonds will become worthless. If one province sets a bad example, other provinces will follow suit, and national credit will be lost. In the future, the central and local governments will have no source of funds for emergency needs or for daily construction. This is the second reason why it is unacceptable from the perspective of the financial future. The government has frequently taken out loans over the years, and the people trust the government. Most of the loose capital has gathered, so there are holders of bonds all over the country. If the bonds lose credibility one day, the domestic financial system will inevitably be disrupted, and the livelihoods of ordinary people will be destroyed. The harm is unimaginable. This is the third reason why it is unacceptable from the perspective of the national economy. The matter is important, and the associations cannot remain silent. In addition to sending telegrams to the authorities in Beiping, Shandong, Hubei, and Guangdong, we respectfully request that you order a strict prohibition to demonstrate unification and care for the people's livelihood. We await your orders with trepidation. The Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association, respectfully.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Director Zhang of Beiping, Beiping. Revered Director Zhang: (The following is the same as the previous telegram) The matter is important, and our associations cannot remain silent.

<p>▲ Fund Committee</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Zhang Xueliang, Beiping. Revered Director Zhang of Beiping: It is reported that you intend to seize customs and salt taxes. After investigation, customs taxes, in addition to guaranteeing foreign debts, are used to guarantee various domestic debts, while salt taxes guarantee salt tax treasury bonds. Over the years, the government has issued various bonds, and the people have actively subscribed to them. The central and local military and political needs have mostly been met from these sources. It is believed that the provinces in the north have used no small amount of these funds. We hope that you will not take actions that will lose the trust of the people. Now that unification has been achieved, how can the central government have no good solutions to the financial problems of the provinces? Bond credit is of utmost importance to the national economy. If the fund is unstable, we fear that the disaster of national bankruptcy and destruction will come without foreign troops. It is our duty, and we cannot remain silent. We respectfully request that you consider the people's livelihood, maintain national credit, and clearly declare to dispel rumors. We are ever so prayerful.

<p>▲ Telegram to the Guangdong Provincial Government. Revered Guangdong Provincial Government: Previously, the Ning-Guang public officials left Guangdong. The customs taxes of the Guangdong Customs, except for the portion guaranteeing foreign debts, were all seized and not remitted. This was a temporary and accidental phenomenon. After investigation, this tax is designated to be used as a fund for various domestic debts, which has been formally approved by the legislative branch. The people have actively subscribed to them. Whether the fund is stable or not is of great importance to the national economy, and it is not a matter of a few people or a few institutions. Now that the government has been reorganized and unified, the central and local governments will naturally come up with good solutions to various financial problems. We respectfully request that you issue an order to the Guangdong Customs to remit the seized taxes to the central government in full and continue to do so in the future in order to protect national credit and avoid setting a bad example.

<h3 id="e90">The Bank of China Increases the Reserve for Banknote Issuance <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>▲ All Domestic Bonds Whose Market Prices Have Fallen Are Excluded</p>
<p>▲ Banknote Holders Can Rest Easy</p>
<p>Since the public disclosure of banknote issuance by the Bank of China, its credibility has been evident. Recently, because a portion of the guarantee reserve consisted of domestic bonds whose market prices have fallen, the people had doubts. It has now been decided that these domestic bonds will be excluded from the reserve in the future in order to strengthen it. This demonstrates that the bank's operations are stable and take into account the overall financial situation. The letter from the bank to the Public Inspection Committee is recorded below: We take the maintenance of a strong reserve for all our bank notes. Sixty percent of it is composed of cash, while the other forty percent is composed of guarantee fund of gold bond from domestic or international locations, and commercial draft. The recent drop in bond prices has had an unfortunate effect on public perception. Even though we value the guarantee fund in the reserve at the current market value to accurately reflect the financial state, the current situation is still unsatisfactory to our standards. We have decided, starting from the inspection on the fourteenth of this month, to withdraw those bonds whose value has not stabilized and replace them with gold debt bond from domestic or international locations, and commercial draft to stabilize the fund and demonstrate our credibility. The details are as follows: The forty percent reserve fund consists of (1) Domestic debt (A) secured by German and Russian compensations (i) seven-year term bond of face value 22,020.00, market value 13,212.00 (13,000 yuan) (ii) fourteen-year 8% bond of face value 165,000.00, market value 132,000.00 (132,000 yuan) (iii) seventeen-year short term financing bond of face value 3,650,000.00, market value 3,285,000.00 (3,285,000 yuan) (2) Gold bond (A) Sino-Belgium gold bond of face value USD 574,400.00, market value 1,450,505.00 national currency (1,450,505 yuan) (B) Sino-France gold bond of face value USD 907,100.00, market value 2,290,656.56 national currency (2,290,656 yuan 56 cents) (C) UK gold war reparations bond of face value GBP 906,900.00, market value 7,557,500.00 national currency (7,557,500 yuan) (D) Australian dollar gold bond of face value USD 48,000.00, market value 202,020.20 national currency (200,202 yuan 20 cents) (E) Japanese dollar gold bond of face value USD 150,000.00, market value 458,754.21 national currency (458,754 yuan 21 cents) (F) UK gold bond of face value GBP 150,000.00, market value 1,750,000.00 national currency (1,750,000 yuan) (3) Land titles (land titles of properties in Shanghai foreign concession) 12,905,825.21 (12,905,825 yuan 21 cents) (4) Highest grade US stocks USD 760,744.87, market value 3,201,788.87 national currency (5) commercial draft of 3,809,017.14 yuan (3,090,017 yuan and 14 cents) The grand total is 31,715,629 yuan 19 cents. The amount issued on the 11th of this month was 122,351,055 yuan. In addition to the 29,368,124 yuan that the other banks took in notes, the amount issued by our bank was 92,669,231 yuan, and forty percent of the amount is 37,067,692.40 yuan. There is in addition, 11,413 yuan and 21 cents extra. We announce that all the reserve fund is of sufficient amount and kindly request that the Shanghai Bank of China note reserve funds public inspection committee prepare this for review. Thank you. Shanghai Bank of China.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Record of the Inauguration of the New Mint Director <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>▲Xu Jiqing Hopes to Abolish Taels and Adopt the Yuan</p>
<p>The newly appointed director of the mint, Mr. Xu Jiqing, arrived at the factory yesterday to take over. A brief account of his inauguration is recorded below: Yesterday at 10:30 a.m., Mr. Xu arrived at the factory. All the factory staff and workers welcomed him. The ceremony hall was set up on the second floor, and the ceremony was carried out accordingly. Then, Mr. Xu delivered a speech, stating that in the eighth and ninth years of the Republic, the banking industry generally believed that the currency system was closely related to finance and should be reorganized. The first step was to abolish taels and use the yuan. The key to abolishing taels and using the yuan lies in the establishment of a mint. At that time, I was also one of the strongest advocates. In the tenth year of the Republic, the Shanghai Mint was established with a loan from a banking syndicate. On March 2nd of that year, the syndicate signed a contract with the government to borrow 2.5 million yuan, and the government would allocate 70,000 yuan per month from the salt surplus, which was expected to be repaid in May of the twelfth year. At the same time, directors Zhong and Sa successively engaged in preparation, purchasing machinery, constructing factory buildings, and hiring the famous American technician, Mr. He Weide, to plan everything. However, the government failed to fulfill the contract and repay the loan on a monthly basis. As a result, the loan was exhausted, and the budget was still insufficient. The factory building was completed, but the machinery had not yet been installed. The Beijing government could not repay the loan and left the factory affairs unattended. Fortunately, the syndicate temporarily kept it safe. By the summer of the sixteenth year of the Republic, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and paid great attention to the reorganization of the currency system. It appointed Wang Zisong and Tang Shoumin as directors successively. In June of the seventeenth year of the Republic, the Economic Conference resolved that the abolition of taels and the use of the yuan must be completed. Finance Minister Song of Shanghai also tried his best to maintain it. Finally, in that year, the previous debt was completely cleared, and the name was changed to the Central Mint. In October, Guo Biao was appointed as the director and actively carried out the work, specially sending several technicians to Europe and the United States to inspect and add the latest machinery, so that it could become the only mint in the world. Recently, the technicians have returned to China one after another and are actively carrying out the work. Unfortunately, Director Guo passed away due to heart disease on January 3rd of the new year, which is a pity for the future of the mint. Recently, Finance Minister Huang believed that the relationship between the mint and the Central Bank was very close. After I was entrusted with the position of Vice President of the Central Bank and Acting President, I was further ordered to concurrently serve as the Director of the Central Mint. I have always served in the bank and have never been an official. However, the mint has a great relationship with finance. Currently, there is only one minting institution in Hangzhou. In the future, when the goal of abolishing taels and using the yuan is achieved, the urgent need for the Central Mint to start operation goes without saying. I and the banking community have tried our best to advocate in the past, and after the planning of Minister Song and Director Guo, I am optimistic about its success. However, before the establishment of the National Government, the political situation was unstable and undecided, and it has been shelved for a long time. In the past three or four years, although the factory foundation has been solid, it has not been able to start minting because the currency standard of our country has not yet been determined. After the publication of the Kemmerer Report, there has been no concrete plan. Recently, the gold standard of various countries in the world has been shaken, and the United Kingdom has taken the lead in suspending the gold standard, and Japan has followed suit in prohibiting the export of cash. It is expected that the issue of the currency standard will eventually be resolved. The abolition of taels and the use of the yuan and the establishment of a standard system in our country are urgent. If the political situation can be stabilized from now on, the minting of silver coins will be realized, and the mission of the Central Mint can be completed. As for the original staff of this factory, they are all knowledgeable and experienced, so there is no need to make any changes. I hope that my colleagues will work with peace of mind. Afterwards, the guest Mr. Dai Ailu delivered a speech, stating that the currency chaos in our country has a great impact on the national economic life, so the unification of the currency system lies first in abolishing taels and changing to yuan, and the abolition of taels and changing to yuan lies first in completing the Central Mint. Today, when Director Xu took office, he repeatedly told the colleagues of the factory about this hope that he would start work as soon as possible to achieve the goal of unifying the currency system, which would be beneficial to the people's livelihood. After the speech, the slogans "Long live the Republic of China" and other slogans were shouted, and the ceremony ended. After the inauguration ceremony, Mr. Xu briefly talked about the factory affairs with Mr. He Weide, the chief engineer of the factory, and received the secretary and section chief to review several official documents. Then, Chief Engineer He led the tour of the entire factory.</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent Letters to Various Industries Soliciting Opinions on the Strike <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>▲Silk and Satin Industry Vetoed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various industries, announcing and soliciting opinions on the student representatives' request for a strike. The letter said: To the esteemed members of the industry, due to the fall of Jinzhou and the Japanese army's advance on Shanhaiguan, the government has no way to deal with it. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of university students and middle school students in this city has sent representatives to the chamber on the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th of this month to request a strike and participate in the citizens' assembly to urge the government to send troops immediately. The chairman of the chamber personally received and explained everything, and submitted it to the 78th Standing Committee meeting for discussion. It was decided that the National Government should be immediately informed by telegram to quickly determine a major plan to use force to recover the lost land and implement revolutionary diplomacy. The issue of a strike is of great importance and should be discussed in detail by the Executive Committee. After the decision was made, in addition to issuing a public telegram, which has been published in various newspapers, the 22nd Executive Committee was convened at 4 p.m. on the 9th of this month to specifically discuss the case. A total of 11 executive committee members and 7 supervisory committee members attended. During the meeting, in addition to the chairman reporting on the progress, the student representatives explained the reasons for advocating a strike and requested (1) that the strike be held on the 11th of this month and (2) that they be allowed to participate in the citizens' assembly on the 17th. After detailed discussions by the committee members present, it was decided that the Executive Supervisory Committee of the chamber would express deep sympathy and admiration for the student representatives' patriotic enthusiasm. The request to participate in the citizens' assembly on the 17th would be notified to all members to actively participate. As for the strike on the 11th, the Executive Supervisory Committee could express its acceptance, but the matter was of great importance and the consent of the various trade associations must be obtained. The date of the strike is proposed to be held on the 17th of this month. Therefore, this case is specially recorded and notified to be handled accordingly. Please promptly reply by letter before the 15th of this month whether or not you agree to hold a strike on the 17th of this month to serve as a basis for the decision. We look forward to your reply and wish you all the best.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association specially replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce regarding the student representatives' request for a strike, expressing its veto. The letter said: We hereby reply that we received your letter on January 11th, in which the student representatives, due to the fall of Jinzhou and the Japanese army's advance on Shanhaiguan, proposed to strike and hold a citizens' assembly on the 17th of this month to urge the government to send troops immediately. We were asked whether we agreed and whether we would participate in the assembly. We were informed that the matter was of great importance and that an emergency meeting was immediately convened to submit it for discussion. Everyone said that while sympathy could be expressed for the patriotic actions of the student representatives, the end of the year is approaching, and all businesses must settle their accounts in order to facilitate turnover. If a strike is held at this time, the capital will inevitably be disrupted and fall into stagnation, leading to commercial panic. Although it is not a pity to sacrifice for the country, in the end, it will not only be of no help to the facts, but will also give the reactionaries an opportunity to make trouble, and the violent Japanese invaders will not be affected by it. For the sake of the present, we can only appeal to the National Government to quickly determine a major plan to implement revolutionary diplomacy and invoke the League of Nations Covenant to arouse the justice of various countries. On the one hand, please immediately deploy capable troops to recover the lost land by force, and order the defending officers to be responsible for the survival of the city. In addition to economic sanctions, the people in the rear must firmly maintain their composure and serve as the government's support. Do not panic and make unnecessary sacrifices to expose their weakness and hasten their demise. Therefore, the members of the association believe that suicide is absolutely unacceptable. In addition to sending representatives to participate in the citizens' assembly at the time, the reply was based on the consensus of the members of the association. We respectfully request your esteemed chamber to base your decision on the opinions of the members of the association, promptly sign and reply to the student representatives, consider carefully, withdraw the previous proposal, and seek other appropriate methods. Please also send a telegram to the National Government to quickly determine a major plan to secure the country and resist foreign aggression, and recover the lost land as soon as possible to reassure the people. We look forward to your reply.</p>

<p>▲Corps Members Assembled Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Volunteer Dare-to-Die National Salvation Corps has been approved by the general assembly to depart north on the 14th. Corps members in this city carried their bedding and assembled at the corps' office next to the Chinese Women's Sports School on Qingxue Road, Zhabei, yesterday.

Mayor Wu Tiecheng personally wrote an inscription: [Revolutionary National Salvation]. Madam He Xiangning personally wrote an inscription: [Following the bloodstains of the martyrs can comfort our conscience]. There are also inscriptions from other literary circles.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Volunteer Dare-to-Die Corps issued a notice stating: Esteemed Sirs, the fall of Jinzhou has caused the Japanese bandits to drive straight in, and half of the country's territory is sinking. The comrades of our corps have repeatedly heard the bad news and are extremely saddened. We have decided to take a train north on the evening of the 14th of this month, and convene a general assembly at the Xiaoximen Juvenile Propaganda Corps at 9 a.m. on the 13th, inviting Mr. Feng Huanzhang to come and give instructions. At that time, we ask all sectors to attend and give instructions. We hereby request your esteemed association to take note of this.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Establishment of the Huai Xu Hai National Defense Support Association <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>▲Advocating Training Local Soldiers to Resist Japan</p>
<p>Chen Yanfu, Jiang Jiechao, Dong Bingnan, Ji Qunqing, and other fellow villagers from Jiangsu Xuhai in Shanghai, believe that the land of Huai Xu Hai is an important part of the national defense. Based on historical facts, it is necessary to strengthen the defense. They specially joined with fellow villagers to form the Jiangsu Huai Xu Hai National Defense Support Association, which was established yesterday and issued a declaration stating: The eastern provinces have fallen, and the Japanese bandits are deepening. Diplomacy cannot save the disaster, and military force cannot rush to the border. The integrity of the country is in danger. The people of our Huai Xu Hai live near the port of Haizhou and the Longhai Railway line. During the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates once used this route to go south and ravaged more than a dozen coastal provinces for hundreds of years. Finally, Hu Zongxian and Qi Jiguang trained local soldiers to eliminate them. At the beginning of the invasion of the eastern provinces, warships were repeatedly sent to spy on Haizhou to measure its strategy. They wanted to go west along the Longhai Railway line to horizontally impact China's waist and ribs, so that the north and south would lose contact and achieve the effect of individual strikes and encirclement. On the one hand, Haizhou is used as a base to benefit from its fish and salt to supplement its military supplies. The art of war says that [winning the enemy and becoming stronger] is also. The people of our Huai Xu Hai are inherently strong, tolerant of hardship, and have great talents. Since the 20th year of the Republic of China, although the military and bandits have repeatedly multiplied, the people have been overwhelmed. However, ordinary families have purchased self-defense firearms, and young scholars who have shooting skills are estimated to be more than 200,000 in the 18 counties of the three prefectures, and the police teams of each county do not have artillery weapons. If it is possible to transform the scattered into the whole, and use the Weiji Guang and Yu Dayou's methods of defending against Japanese pirates, and learn from Zeng Wenzheng and Zuo Wenxiang's methods of training the group, it can be used to protect against disasters and defend the people. It is generally agreed that soldiers are stationed in agriculture, which is the plan of the past dynasties in our country. Now, the 3.6 million square miles and 28 million people in Liaodong have been captured by the Japanese pirates at their fingertips. Men are used as guns, women are used as the lower ranks, property is confiscated, and national sovereignty is taken away. If the large groups had been united earlier to gather self-defense, the whole to resist Japanese slaves would have led to such a loss of power and humiliation. However, the Japanese slaves are not satisfied with the loss of Liaoning. Once they land from Haizhou, this tragedy will continue the Ming Dynasty and open the prelude. The lessons of the past can be learned. At this critical moment, we should plan ahead. The comrades are specifically organizing themselves to support the national defense and do their best. We specially declare this to the people of the whole country.</p>

<p>The Newly Compiled 60th Army of the National Revolution sent a telegram stating: (Title omitted) I am deeply saddened that since the Northeast Incident, Japanese slaves have occupied our land, plundered our people, and looted our property. Those who hear it are saddened, and those who speak of it are pained. Recently, it has become more and more aggravated and increasingly encroaching, trapping my Jinzhou and attempting to break into Jian Pass. However, our border defense soldiers only know the doctrine of non-resistance and retreat step by step. If we continue to think like this, the Great Wall's defense will be withdrawn and Tianjin will not be guaranteed. The Japanese pirates' iron hooves will spread all over North China. Our army is responsible for defending the territory by force and cannot bear the loss of the country. We are determined to fulfill the responsibility of every man. We are ready to wait for orders to be the pioneers of killing thieves and vow to sprinkle our hot blood to wash away the national disaster and build national fortresses with our heads. The salvation spirit of the people is enthusiastic, but the power of building a single unit is still weak. We hope that the people of the whole country will support us so that our army can fulfill its long-cherished wish. The country is fortunate, and the nation is fortunate. Lee Chung Jen, Commander of the Newly Compiled 60th Army, Shang Li, Staff Officer of the First Division, Hu Kuang-chun, Commander of the Second Division, Chen Yin-tan, Commander of the Third Division, and Wang Le-tung, Commander of the Training Division, led all officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers to kowtow.</p>

<p>The Radio Operators' National Salvation Anti-Japanese Association wrote to the people of the country: To all newspapers, the people of the country, the national army was originally raised to resist foreign invaders, and the people pay tens of millions of dollars in taxes to feed them, hoping that they will defend the country and resist enemies in times of crisis. However, the fall of Jinzhou and the danger of Tianjin are shocking news, and those in charge are all self-interested and shirk responsibility. They are servile and weak against foreign countries and strive for power and profit internally, disregarding public opinion and even suppressing the people's patriotic movement under the pretext of reactionary crimes. This is very painful. Compatriots, the situation is urgent. If we continue to sit idly by, the country will perish soon. In the face of such a dangerous situation, we should strive for strength and organize people's self-defense groups to expand people's movements and concentrate people's power to closely monitor the government's efforts to resist Japanese imperialism and its allies. At the same time, we should vigorously implement economic sanctions to promote its economic collapse, so that the dangerous situation can have a glimmer of hope. As members of the people, we cannot sit idly by, but the responsibility of saving the country is heavy and great. Although we have established branches throughout the country, we are afraid that our abilities are limited and we will not be able to succeed. We vow to cooperate with the people of the whole country. We earnestly request the nation to discern our blood and tears.

<p>▲Quota Full, Planning for Expansion</p>
<p>▲Drawing Lots to Determine Booth Location</p>
<p>The Zhabei Third National Goods Exhibition, organized by the Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods, is fully prepared. The thatched houses built for the exhibition have also been approved for completion today. The industrial and commercial booths have been fairly divided by the field affairs committee members Chen Bing, Si Xu Jianruo. A total of 70 booths will be allotted with dimensions of twelve feet deep and ten feet wide. A fourth large display area is designated for non-participating factory members to exhibit products for publicity. The circular walkway is fifteen to twenty feet wide to facilitate traffic and prevent congestion, so as to avoid losing the true meaning of circumspect viewing and practical reference. Hongxiang Water and Electricity Materials Co. undertakes the installation of electric lights throughout the field and the construction of two electrified archways at the front and rear gates to enhance the scenery. The number of participating factories has reached the full quota by 10 a.m. yesterday. Those who came to ask to participate afterwards were still crowding, and it was difficult to refuse the enthusiastic support of the various factories. It was decided to allow the expansion of the location, and only when it was absolutely necessary would the same industry be merged for display to avoid exclusion. It is learned that the association has scheduled a representative conference of participating factory owners to be held at the Jiumudi Club at 3 p.m. today to discuss all the ongoing issues and to draw lots in public to determine the booth location and issue association certificates and staff badges. The secretariat notified the various factories yesterday to send representatives to attend and limited the entry to the field to 9 a.m. on the 14th for the layout and completion of the display by 12 p.m. on the 15th, and to invite guests from all walks of life to visit at 2 p.m. The various departments of the association were preparing overnight quickly and completely with deep experience. Everything is proceeding very smoothly.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Coal Industry Groups Sanction Yongchang Coal Company <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>▲ **Privately Importing Japanese Coal and Undermining the Anti-Japanese Movement**</p>
<p>▲ **Fellow Business Owners and Workers Unanimously Decide to Sever Ties**</p>
<p>▲ **Public Assembly Resolution** On January 12th, at 2 PM, the Coal Industry Association held a joint meeting of the Executive Committee and Inspection Committee regarding the owner of Yongchang Coal Company (Chihama Bridge, Xinzha Road), Wu Jichang, who on the 11th of this month dispatched store employees with a single manifest for 188 tons of Matsuura coal imported from Mitsui Coal Depot's Kahoto Mine, openly and privately transporting it to the Chihama Bridge warehouse. The inspection staff of this industry encountered them and reported to the inspection staff of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association, who together went to seal the coal. Wu Jichang, the owner of Yongchang Coal Company, dared to collude with a Westerner from a certain foreign firm to falsely report to the Gordon Road Police Station that robbers were stealing coal. The police station, acting on the report, dispatched a police car to arrest the alleged robbers. At that time, 5 PM, the inspection staff transferred the Japanese coal from the river to the Yitaixing West Warehouse. The police went to the second branch of the fourth district to demand the extradition of the five inspectors Yan Bin, Ye Yongfu, Fang Bainian, Xie Baoxing from the labor union, and Tang Rongsheng from the Anti-Japanese Association. He Bumming, the chief of the second branch of the fourth district, refused. Later, the association sent a letter and dispatched Pan Yisan and Wang Wenzheng as representatives to provide bail. Twenty-three committee members and over one hundred sixty members attended the meeting, and they publicly elected Wei Hongwen as chairman. The resolutions were: ㈠ How to handle Yongchang's private import of Japanese coal? The meeting resolved: (甲) Announce in the newspaper that Wu Jichang, the owner of Yongchang Coal Company, is guilty of privately buying Japanese coal and undermining the anti-Japanese movement, and send a letter to the banking and money exchange industries requesting them to sever ties with the traitorous merchant Wu Jichang of Yongchang immediately and refuse to list his products on the market. (乙) All businesses in the industry will completely sever ties with Yongchang. (丙) Appoint Lu Qisheng, Pan Yisan, and Mao Chunpu to urge the Anti-Japanese Association to actively handle this case. (丁) Everyone should sever ties with Yongchang, and those who outwardly comply but secretly disobey will be treated the same as Yongchang. ㈡ How to handle Yongchang's false report to the Gordon Road Police Station about coal robbery? The meeting resolved to send a letter to the Public Works Department and the Gordon Road Police Station stating that the association is conducting patriotic movement inspections and requesting that they not misunderstand and believe false reports in the future. On one hand, the association will appoint its perennial legal counsel to file a lawsuit according to law to protect the association's inspectors. An interim proposal was made to reward those who report private imports of Japanese coal. The meeting resolved to award the reporter one yuan per ton, regardless of whether they are in the same industry. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM.</p>
<p>▲ **Labor Union Resolution** The Coal and Firewood Workers' Union held an emergency meeting yesterday, chaired by Zheng Xiaotang, with Yao Suikai as the recorder. ㈠ The chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting and the process of the union dispatching staff to work with the Coal Industry Association to detain a large batch of Japanese goods privately imported by Yongchang Coal Company. ㈡ Yongchang Coal Company's private import of Japanese goods is deliberate sabotage of the patriotic movement and is extremely despicable. How should we express our opinion? The meeting decided to order all workers of the company to resign voluntarily. ㈢ After the resignation, how should the livelihood problems of these workers be solved? The meeting decided that the union should create a list and earnestly request the industry association to take responsibility. ㈣ Notify all workers in the city to never work for Yongchang. The resolution was passed. ㈤ Yongchang Coal Company does not know it is wrong but has detained the union's investigators. How should we handle it? The meeting decided to request higher authorities to handle it strictly and send a letter of warning from the union. ㈥ Should the union send representatives to attend the industry association's hearing? The meeting decided to appoint Zheng Xiaotang and Yao Suikai. ㈦ Restore the union's anti-Japanese work. The resolution was passed.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Japanese Yarn Case Not Yet Heard <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>▲ **Further Investigation Needed Before Decision**</p>
<p>It was reported in this newspaper that the Shenxin Yarn Factory recently uncovered a large batch of Japanese yarn impersonating its "Human Clock" trademark, and the Public Security Bureau, together with the Harbin police, escorted the case to the First Special District Court. This case was originally scheduled to be heard yesterday, but because the court wanted to understand the truth, the police are currently conducting a detailed investigation to allow them to file a public prosecution. Therefore, the hearing was not held yesterday. The Shenxin Yarn Factory has entrusted attorneys Wu Linkun and others from the Tongren Law Firm to handle the case. It is reported that if the police do not file a public prosecution in this case, Shenxin will file a private prosecution. It is now heard that during the investigation yesterday, clues were obtained regarding the exclusive sale of this counterfeit yarn. It is rumored that the crime site is in the French Concession, so the date of the trial is currently difficult to schedule. Because this case is quite significant, it must be thoroughly investigated before a hearing can be held.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the Shenxin Textile Company previously suspected of mixing Japanese goods with the 20-count and 42-count "Human Clock" yarn found on the market and offered a large reward in the newspaper to clarify the matter. Since the case has been solved, it has been proven that this act was entirely the initiative of Japanese merchants to repackage. Therefore, attorney Wu Linkun and others have been entrusted to publish a notice in the newspaper to revoke the previous reward advertisement.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Wu Nanpu Kidnapping: Ransom of 400,000 Demanded <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>▲ **Rescued in the Beixinjing Area**</p>
<p>▲ **Bandits Still Deviously Attempt to Deny Involvement**</p>
<p>▲ **Police Request Investigation of Case**</p>
<p>▲ **Court Hearing Rescheduled for Two Weeks**</p>
<p>Wu Ze, also known as Nanpu, a broker from the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange, No. 49, is from Gu'an, Jiangxi Province, and is currently 56 years old. He resides at No. 42 Liaoyang Road, Wader Road. On the morning of the 7th of this month, at 9:00 AM, Wu was riding in his private car from his home, intending to go to Linqing Road, Yangshupu, when suddenly multiple kidnappers blocked his path near Pingliang Road and Lan Road, threatening him with guns. They kidnapped Wu and sped away in a black sedan that was waiting by the roadside. After his family learned of this, they reported to the police and requested a rescue. On the 9th, Wu's family suddenly received a letter from the kidnappers demanding a ransom of 400,000 yuan, so they again reported to the police. In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Lu Liankui, the chief Chinese detective of the General Inspectorate of the General Police Department, received a tip that a person from Tongzhou named Lu Wenbin was the mastermind of this case and was currently hiding in the Suzhou Inn at No. 810 Zhejiang Road. Chief Detective Lu immediately led Chinese detectives Liu Shaokui, Tang Jian, Wu Changkai, detective Feng Zhiming, and Western detective Thanerfou to the inn. They arrested Lu Wenbin in room 24 and also arrested an accomplice named Zhang Afu, taking them both back to the police station. He assigned detectives to guard the room. After strict interrogation of Lu Wenbin, the suspect confessed that the hostage Wu Nanpu was hidden in a bungalow near Fangjia Wood Bridge at the end of Beibaoxing Road, Beixinjing, in the Chinese district. Chief Detective Lu then led Detective Liu, along with detectives Wang Chengying, Bao Han Zhang, Shen Tianbao, Xie Futang, and others, each equipped with weapons, and took Lu Wenbin in a car to the Sixth District Police Station. They went to the address with the police detectives. They arrived at the bandits' den at 2:30 AM. They broke into the house and arrested two people from Tongzhou, Zhang Tonggen and Zhang Laigen. They seized a pistol and five bullets and rescued the hostage Wu Nanpu. They then captured three more people, Lu Maoqing, Zhang Dexing, and Liu Degui, in the next room and took them back to the police station together. The detectives guarding the Suzhou Inn also arrested Sun Jinpeng (also known as Lao Wu) and escorted them to the police station. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, they were escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Zhou Hanting and Prosecutor Qian Hongye took their seats for interrogation. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case and said that the police were prosecuting according to Articles 1 and 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. Due to time constraints, he requested that the hearing be postponed for two weeks to facilitate the investigation. Chinese and Western detectives then reported on the arrest situation. Wu Nanpu then reported on the kidnapping situation and identified Lu Wenbin as the one who held the ransom letter and ordered him to write it in his own handwriting. Zhang Afu was formerly a car driver at the Xinchanglong Customs Broker at No. 287 De'an Lane, North Suzhou Road, and he also had a business account at the agency, so Zhang knew him. This case may have been his tip-off. Sun Jinpeng was the one who carried out the kidnapping on the scene, stripped him of his coat, and stole 36 yuan in cash. Zhang Tonggen, Zhang Laigen, and Lu Maoqing were the bandits who guarded him. Liu Degui was the one who delivered tea and rice to him every day. Lu Wenbin confessed that someone surnamed Ding ordered him to write the draft of the letter, and he did not participate in the prior planning. Zhang Afu denied any involvement in the case. Sun Jinpeng confessed without hesitation. Zhang Tonggen, Zhang Laigen, and Lu Maoqing confessed that Sun Jinpeng ordered them to guard the hostage. Liu Degui confessed to guarding the garden outside the bandits' den and denied delivering tea and rice. The court judge reviewed the confessions and decided to reschedule the case for two weeks and remand all defendants.</p>

<p>Zhu Ziqiao, Xu Shiying, Qu Wenliu, and others from the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, in view of the fact that compatriots in the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have been unable to settle in their homes and have been displaced since being occupied by the brutal Japanese. At this severe winter season, their cries of hunger and cold are extremely tragic, and the number of young students who have lost their education due to this is even greater. Recently, Wu Zhanlin, a Northeast student from Chaoyang College in Beiping, requested relief from the committee. As a result, Zhu Ziqiao and others initiated the establishment of the Northeast National Disaster Relief Association for Compatriots, soliciting large sums of money from all parties to save these orphans. As of yesterday, Zhu Ziqiao, Xu Shiying, and Gu Zhutong recognized and helped with 1,000 yuan, Qu Wenliu, Wang Yiting, and Huang Hanzhi recognized and raised 1,000 yuan, and the Relief Commission allocated 1,000 yuan. Xu Shiying helped himself with 100 yuan. In addition, there are still overseas Chinese who are in contact with recognized donors, and the amount is already quite significant. According to Zhu Ziqiao, they will definitely find ways to allow unemployed compatriots to continue their studies starting next semester to preserve the nation's vitality.</p>

<p>▲ **Sentenced to One Year and One Day in Prison**</p>
<p>According to the "Great American Evening News," American woman Hecq was convicted in the case of stealing and transporting relief wheat. Hecq conspired with a German and three others to steal and sell the relief wheat. On December 7, after the American relief wheat was transported to Shanghai, Hecq secretly instructed a barge to load 746 bags of wheat and anchor at the Lan Road pier, and then transport it onto a car and away in the night. However, after the incident, she was arrested and assisted the authorities in recovering the stolen goods and arresting the remaining accomplices. Therefore, Judge Pandi leniently sentenced her to one year and one day in prison and sent her to the McNeill Island Correctional Institution in Washington State, USA, to reform. In addition, American woman Walsh was accused of theft for swindling goods from businesses for several months due to unemployment. Today, the American judge also sentenced her to one year and six months in prison and sent her to McNeill Island.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Mastermind of Kidnapping Case Three Years Ago Identified <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>▲ **Huang Xianwu Tragically Torn to Pieces**</p>
<p>▲ **Shi Danran Confesses to Past Events**</p>
<p>The notorious bandit Shi Danran, also known as Danquan, 28 years old, from Shaoxing, specializes in colluding with gangs to kidnap people for ransom and tear up tickets in this city, and there are too many cases to count. Recently, he was arrested by the police in the French Concession for another kidnapping case and sent to the court, where he was sentenced to five years in prison and then sent to the mainland for legal action. Recently, Dong Mingde, a foreman from the First District of Nanshi, reported through an informant that Shi was the mastermind of the kidnapping of Huang Xianwu, the owner of Huang Yitai Longan Store in Xian Gua Street, outside the Dadongmen of Nanshi, in the Republic of China in 1928. Yesterday morning, he took detective Yuan Haishan, Lu Anpu, and others to the court to extradite Shi and interrogated him in Nanshi. According to him, in January of the Republic of China in 1928, he met Zhou Zuohan, a former battalion commander, at a friend's house. Both sides talked about how it would be better to do some business since they had been idle for a long time. Then, Chen Bolin, as an informant, came up with the idea of kidnapping Huang Xianwu, the owner of Huang Yitai Longan Store in Xian Gua Street, outside the Dadongmen. So, on the morning of the second day of the second lunar month of that year, around 8:00 AM, Zhou Zuohan assigned Zhou Afa, Wang Jinshi, and someone named Youbing to carry firearms, and Ma Guisheng drove a car near the Dadongmen and kidnapped Huang Xianwu and hid him on the floor of a building at a certain number on Hou Chang Road, Yu Garden Road, North City, and Zhou and others guarded the hostage. He then wrote a letter and sent it to Huang's family demanding a ransom. Huang's family sent their friend Wang Huiru, also known as Wang Laowu, to meet with Qiu Bosun, the person assigned by him, at the Central Hotel in North Shanghai, and they met several times. Unexpectedly, Wang had bad intentions and not only did not take the money to redeem the ticket but continued to embezzle more than 4,000 yuan in foreign currency. He was extremely angry and tore up the ticket. At that time, he shot Huang Xianwu to death with a pistol. Chen Bolin, Zhou Afa, Wang Jinshi, and others are all on the run. Zhou Zuohan, Ma Guisheng, and others have been arrested and executed by firing squad in other kidnapping cases. He said that since the matter concerned kidnapping, he was ordered to prepare a document and submit it to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>▲ **Wife and Children Cry Piteously**</p>
<p>▲ **Kind Villagers Help With Arrangements**</p>
<p>A Jing-Hu train departed from Beijing the day before yesterday and arrived at Nanxiang Station around 3:00 PM. A passenger, resembling a villager, boarded the train with his wife and two children, ages eight and six. As the train traveled four or five li from Zhenru Station, the passenger suddenly collapsed and died. Passengers in the car were thrown into chaos. When the train attendant learned of this, he blew the whistle and immediately stopped the train, carrying the body off the train and placing it by the roadside. The passenger's wife pleaded with the attendant to take the body off the train at Zhenru Station, saying that the area was desolate and difficult to guard, but the attendant refused because of the hygiene of the passengers on the train. The wife was helpless and cried by the roadside, holding the body. The two children also cried with their mother. Fortunately, kind people in the area came forward to inquire. According to the passenger's wife, they lived in a village northwest of Nanxiang, more than ten li from the station. Her husband had no prior illnesses and was traveling to Shanghai with his children to attend a banquet at a relative's house and to have his frostbite on his feet treated. The villagers, seeing this, felt sorry for them and temporarily took in the two children and sent someone to accompany the wife to her home in Nanxiang. The family had no money to buy a coffin. The wife borrowed money from relatives to cover the body for three days and nights. Yesterday, the wife borrowed silver dollars to buy a coffin in Zhenru. She and her two children transported the coffin back, and before leaving, the wife and her two children prostrated themselves on the ground to thank the villagers.</p>

<p>▲ **Requesting Cancellation of Provisional Execution**</p>
<p>The Yixin Lane tenants and the owners, Cheng Linsheng and Cheng Yize, are involved in a lawsuit in the Special District Court over eviction issues. The court has ruled that the tenants should be evicted immediately and declared a provisional execution. The tenants have filed an appeal against the provisional execution, requesting an urgent disposition to advance the trial and cancel the declaration of provisional execution. The first reason is that the jurisdiction is wrong, stating that this case belongs to the local jurisdiction. Local Judge Yang Kai heard the case, and the summons also stated "Di Zi No. 452." Judge Yang did not express any objection to the jurisdiction, but suddenly changed it to a primary case. Therefore, they requested a correction regarding the declaration of disapproval of provisional execution, even if it belongs to a primary case, Article 464 of the Civil Procedure Law should also be applied ["If the debtor proves that the provisional execution may cause irreparable damage, the court should declare disapproval of the provisional execution according to the circumstances of Article 462 upon their request"]. And other various reasons. Yesterday morning, the civil court president Zhou Daren held a collegiate panel hearing. The tenants' lawyers Ye Fukang, Yu Hualong, and others were present, but Cheng Linsheng and others were not. Judge Ying then adjourned the hearing to another date.</p>

<h3 id="e130">At Least Six Major Reforms Should Be Made in Politics <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of political reform, one cannot help but sigh with exhaustion. The reform of Chinese politics has been going on for nearly thirty or forty years. In these decades, what has not been tried, such as constitutional monarchy, democratic republic, centralized power, one-party dictatorship? However, today's political phenomenon is still not on track, society is still in chaos, the economy is increasingly bankrupt, bandits are becoming more and more numerous, warlord separatism is still the same, and corruption is rampant. Recently, the Japanese have unreasonably occupied our entire Northeast. Let us look at Turkey after the Great War, which was oppressed by the Treaty of Mudros. All the coastal artillery positions of the straits were managed by the Allied forces, all warships had to be handed over, and all wireless, wired, and submarine cables were under the control of the Allied forces. Shipyards and all railways in the harbor were used by the Allied forces. Was not such a national situation even worse than China today? However, thanks to the leadership of Kemal, they were able to eliminate the corrupt old government internally and defeat the powerful Greek forces that manipulated them externally, and there was the Lausanne Conference that abolished unequal treaties. In less than ten years, Turkey has become a modern country again. In addition, the Japanese Restoration has been going on for less than sixty years, and the revival of Germany, which was defeated in the Great War, has only taken about ten years. Why has China not made any progress after thirty or forty years of reform? I believe that there are many and complex reasons for this, and the incomplete and insincere nature of political reform is also a major reason. In the future, if China's politics are to be on track, thorough and genuine reform, at least the existing politics should have the following six reforms: 1. Abolish the one-party dictatorship and implement party politics. One-party dictatorship is theoretically untenable and practically unworkable. Party politics is theoretically correct and has these advantages in practice: (A) Party politics is a natural political education, which can achieve the purpose of political tutelage. (B) Party politics is an effective political supervision, which can achieve progressive politics. (C) Party politics can gather national talents to jointly plan the great cause of the country. 2. Generate legitimate public opinion organs and promulgate a constitution representing public opinion. The constitution stipulates the rights and obligations of the people and the government, and the organs of public opinion are indispensable to any country. However, China did not have a provisional constitution until recently, and today there is still no legitimate organ representing public opinion. This is one of the reasons why politics is not on track. 3. The people's opinion and publication must be guaranteed by law and not subject to any illegal interference or oppression. Only in this way can strong and impartial public opinion be created. Only with impartial public opinion can there be right and wrong, and only with right and wrong can politics have a way. 4. Stop using national funds to fill party expenses. In theory, the party is part of the country and should not use public funds of the country as private expenses of a party. In fact, today's party departments in various places have lost the faith of the people, have no work, and cannot work. If they are not abolished, they will only be hated by the people. 5. In the current national crisis, we advocate imitating the national defense government organized by the French during the Franco-Prussian War, regardless of party affiliation, and the mixed cabinet recently organized by the British to deal with the economic crisis, to deal with the current Sino-Japanese problem. 6. In the current national crisis, we advocate that the Sino-Japanese problem should be decided by national referendum. The above six points, the first four points are the reforms that politics should have, and the latter two points are the reforms that should be made to deal with the current national crisis. I believe that it is the great way for China to rise from the dead. We citizens should rise up and strive for it. (Bing)</p>

<h3 id="e133">Normal School Students Must Serve Their Term Before Being Allowed to Further Their Education <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>▲Those Who Have Already Advanced Must Perform Service After Graduation</p>
<p>Several years ago, there were quite a few normal school graduates who went on to universities and colleges above the level of specialized schools. Later, the principals of provincial middle schools and the educational administrative authorities agreed that the public cultivation of normal school students was aimed at training elementary school teachers for local education. Even if normal school students wanted to pursue further studies and strive for advancement, they received free treatment from the public and were different from ordinary self-funded middle school graduates. Therefore, normal school graduates must undergo a considerable period of service after graduation to repay the public before they can advance to further studies. In the past two years, the educational administrative authorities have paid attention to implementing this matter. The Ministry of Education previously received a report from the Fujian Education Department, which was submitted by Xiamen University, a private university, asking whether this year's new students, who had graduated from senior high normal schools, should be allowed to make changes in their studies. The Ministry of Education instructed the department that senior high normal school graduates who have received free treatment must have proof of service before they are allowed to advance to further studies. Previously, the National Central University reported difficulties in handling this matter and requested instructions. It was instructed that since these students had been admitted, they should be allowed to retain their admission qualifications and enter the university in the next academic year after completing their service. For students who have no service opportunities, in order to take care of their studies, they are temporarily allowed to make special accommodations and wait until after graduation to complete their service to show compassion. However, this cannot be taken as an example in the future. The matter reported by Xiamen University is the same and should be handled in the same way.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Two Cables from the Education Sector <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>(1) Cable to the Government to Quickly Determine Foreign Policy</p>
<p>(2) Cable to the Whole Country to Unite in Spirit</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Sector National Salvation United Association issued two cables yesterday as follows: (1) To the Nanjing National Government: The new government was established for three days, and Jinzhou was lost. The eastern border is completely lost. The disaster is imminent. The people of the country deeply love and look forward to the new government, but after many days, the government has not taken any concrete measures. The people are bewildered and do not know what to do. Therefore, we implore our government to find a way to remedy the situation as soon as possible. If it benefits the country, the people will do their best to support the government. We are extremely terrified by this telegram. Shanghai Education Sector National Salvation United Association. (2) To the elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters of the whole country: The three provinces have fallen, and the four borders are in danger. The whole country, from top to bottom, is working together to defend against the enemy, but we are still afraid that it will not be enough. However, we read in the newspapers that some ambitious military men in various provinces are suddenly advocating joint defense, disregarding the national crisis and only fighting for territory. They are frantic and insane. If the country is not defended but the provinces are defended, then it is intended to divide the territory. If the outside is not defended but the inside is defended, then disaster can be called upon. The proverb says that if the skin is not there, what will the hair cling to? Hearing this ominous news increases the worry of national subjugation. All of us citizens should try to save ourselves, rise up to express our opposition, and hope that we will jointly send a telegram to the government to clearly investigate and stop those who have it, and prevent those who do not. Unite in spirit and face the outside world. The country is fortunate. Shanghai Education Sector National Salvation United Association.</p>

<p>▲Representatives' Remarks: Zhang Shude, head of the delegation, said to the reporter of the China Society: "At a time when the country is in trouble, the central responsibility is borne by Mr. Wang, Jiang, and Hu, but the three gentlemen are not in Beijing, which has caused the government to lose its center of gravity and politics to fall into a state of despair. The students and others, based on their patriotism, do not hesitate to sacrifice their precious time to urge Mr. Wang, Jiang, and Hu to rush to Beijing to jointly face the national crisis. After staying in Shanghai for a short time to urge Wang, they will go to Fenghua to urge Jiang and Hong Kong to urge Hu. They will not return to Beijing until the goal is achieved."</p>
<p>▲Wang Was Sick and Did Not See Them: The delegation was afraid that there would be too many people and the actions would be inconvenient, so after arriving in Shanghai, they specially sent representatives Xu Ruixiang and Zhang Shude to Wang's residence on Pushi Road, hoping to meet Wang. However, Wang was sick in the hospital and could not see guests. The representatives handed the letter to Wang's residence for forwarding. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Mr. Jingwei, a great view. We, the entire student body of our school, are aware that the country is in a daily decline, foreign aggression is increasingly urgent, the central hub is vacant, and the center of gravity is falling. Therefore, regardless of everything, we have come to Shanghai to urge you to quickly go to Beijing and cooperate with Jiang and Hu to preside over the party and the country.

As a result, there are more than a dozen organizations of volunteer troops to the Northeast in various places. The enthusiasm of our unarmed people to resist Japan and save the country is so intense. The military officers who possess hundreds of thousands of troops and face one side alone should be so inspired. However, instead of trying to survive for the Chinese youth, they have even brewed nine-province joint defense and some kind of political committee in order to undermine unification and form warlord separatism. The actions of such frantic and insane people are opposed by our people to the death. Those ambitious warlords and politicians should quickly take care of themselves.

<p>▲ John Had the Will but Not the Strength</p>
<p>▲ Failed 50 to 21 Yesterday</p>
<p>￣↓Tonight, Group B Finals↓</p>
<p>The John University basketball team fell short. In yesterday's final against the Pirates, they still lost 50 to 21. Thus, the Pirates won the Western Green Basketball Championship for the third year in a row. The Pirates were unstoppable, exerting relentless pressure on John from beginning to end, leaving them overwhelmed. The Pirates' long shots were particularly wonderful, beyond description and irresistible. In the first half, the score was 21 to 6. The referees were Zhang Guodong and inspector Xu Zhendong. There was also a Group A game, which Qingguang won. The first half score was 17 to 12, resulting in a final score of 32 to 27.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Reasons for John's Failure <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Less than three minutes into the game, John lost six points in a row due to inadequate defense. Haines shot from the corner of the basket, Lin Zequn headed it in himself, and Euler shot from long range. Mysteriously, they lost three goals in a row. First, their luck with the ball was poor, and they could not penetrate under the basket, with most attempts failing due to inaccurate rebound angles. Second, the Pirates were accurate with long-range shots under the basket, hitting the mark every time with incredible skill. Third, while the Pirates' shooting guards were skilled, John's defense was lax, with gaps appearing frequently. In the first half, they used a five-man zone defense, but the Pirates crisscrossed and shot from long range with ease. Although they switched to a man-to-man defense in the second half, their running and turning were not as quick as the Pirates. Given these three shortcomings, how could John not lose? If the Pirates continue to dominate, where will valiant athletes rise up to defeat them? It is a pity that the Northeast University basketball team has become a historical term today; otherwise, they would surely give the Pirates a head-on blow.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Talking About the Fall of Jinzhou to the Japanese <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The Japanese bandits' iron cavalry advanced rapidly and directly, and Jinzhou has fallen. The place is twenty-five li from the Nuer River. It was established as a state in Liaoning and a prefecture in the Qing Dynasty, belonging to Shengjing. It was abolished in the Republic of China. Today's Jin County is its old governance. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Zu Dashou defended Jinzhou. Upon hearing of the loss of Songshan, he surrendered the city to the Qing Dynasty. This place has been contested by military strategists, not just starting today. To the west is the Xiaoling River, to the north is the Shajia Cemetery, and Tangjiatun is to the east. There are sedans and large carts for transportation, where sedans carry people, and large carts transport goods, which is very convenient. Markets are all in the city, and there are very few markets outside the city. In the city is the Great Buddha Temple, which has a pagoda thirty zhang high, said to have been built in the Tang Dynasty. The people are mostly superstitious in divine power. Every year on the eighteenth day of the abolished lunar April, there is a Niangniang Fair. There are also the Dizang Fair on April 28th and the City God Fair on May 28th. There are various operas and other performances to please the gods and pray for blessings, with people exerting all their efforts for them. Nearby are Guanyin Cave and Jinniu Cave. From late summer to early autumn, the vegetation is lush, and men and women come to visit in an endless stream, especially painters sketching from life, as the scenery is beautiful and the location is excellent for painting. Products include shrimp oil pickles, felt strips, felt hats and shoes, pigs, pig bristles, wool, beans, and bean cakes, all transported to Tianjin, Yingkou, and other places for sale, and business is thriving. This time, the Japanese people have been rampant, and the loss is greater than ever before. The Japanese people take burning and killing as a display of power and rape as pleasure. A certain soldier once broke into the Wang family in Xiaoxinmintun. The young widow of the Wang family was quite beautiful. The soldier wanted to defile her. The woman deliberately kept him to drink. When he was drunk, the woman struck the soldier's head with a wine jar. She hit with great force, breaking his head and causing brain matter to flow out, killing him. Knowing that she had caused trouble, the woman immediately took poison and committed suicide. Those who heard about it said that since the Republic of China, the world has been declining, and there have been very few reports of women's chastity and martyrdom. Anyone who talks about it is branded as pedantic. Unexpectedly, in the midst of national crisis, there is such a moving and praiseworthy story, which is truly rare. A guest returning from Beiping mentioned it, so I specifically praise it. It is also the responsibility of us writers.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Cheng Yanqiu Takes Students in the South <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Si Ren</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, Xun Huisheng had his eldest son, Lingxiang, study with Cheng Yuqiu. A banquet was held at Fengzeyuan to perform the apprenticeship ceremony. At 5 PM that afternoon, Huisheng led Lingxiang to Cheng's residence to respectfully welcome Yuqiu to Fengzeyuan. Many guests brought congratulatory couplets. Here are some of the best ones. Huilu's couplet said, "Cheng's gate stands in the snow," "Xun's son is like a dragon." Liu Xiaosang's couplet said, "Jade is moist and frost is clear, reflecting the three-foot snow of Cheng's gate," "The inkstone pond is autumn water, adding a few fragrances to Xun's order." And also, "Snow tablets serve Yichuan, and good young masters are seen in this turbid world," "Bamboo books carry dark solutions, and old friends enjoy having virtuous fathers and brothers." At six o'clock, the apprenticeship ceremony was held. After the ceremony, they entered the banquet. The guests pushed Liu Xiaosang to deliver a congratulatory speech, which briefly said, "Today is the New Year's Day holiday. Yuqiu will soon go abroad to study theatrical arts, making his first grand tour. Lingxiang also takes Yuqiu as his teacher today, which is truly an unprecedented grand event. I hope Lingxiang will not only learn Yuqiu's popular tunes, but also continue Yuqiu's great cause of reforming drama, then his achievements should be above those of ordinary famous actors." Then Xu Lingxiao gave a speech, which briefly said, "Yuqiu's becoming a school is not only due to his tunes. His thoughts and talents are increasingly moving towards the mission of drama, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people. And he will soon go to Europe to study, which will greatly enhance the art of drama. It is truly an unprecedented feat in the drama world. Now Lingxiang is seeking knowledge at this time, which is of great significance. I hope Yuqiu will teach him carefully so that Lingxiang can become someone who has contributed to the art of drama. Therefore, I use two lines of opera lyrics, 'The father is a hero, the son is a good man, and there are no weak soldiers under a strong general' to congratulate Lingxiang." At this point, the guests asked Yuqiu to give a reply. Yuqiu briefly said, "Today is the first day of my thirtieth year. It is also the first day that I changed my name to Yanqiu. It is also the first day that I have enrolled disciples. Confucius said that at thirty, one should be established. This establishment means being able to stand up. This standing up is not easy. I am thirty years old, so I changed the word 'Yan' in 'Yanli' to the word 'Yan' in 'Yantian.' My inkstone field is still reclaiming barren land. However, farmers who plant fields hope to harvest. Confucius also said, 'The problem with people is that they like to be teachers.' I cannot stand up yet. How can I suddenly become a teacher, isn't it a contradiction? But I accept Lingxiang as a disciple for two reasons. First, because Lingxiang is smart and studies English and arithmetic, and he is quite diligent. That's why I'm willing to be his teacher. Second, because Huisheng is my senior. His art is brilliant. If I don't teach well, he will correct it. So I dare to be his teacher. The gateway to learning drama must first learn Kunqu to lay the foundation. Mr. Wang Bosheng said that he must first learn spoken drama. I highly agree because spoken drama has no music to rely on. Its inner performance is especially difficult. I hope Lingxiang will work hard on it." Then Huisheng gave a reply, which briefly said, "Yuqiu's words are too polite. My art is not brilliant. I can't teach my son, so I ordered my son to seek teaching from someone brilliant. What the gentlemen said is to maintain art, and I have benefited a lot. I am especially grateful for your love for my little son. Please everyone drink a big white one." After leaving the seats, a group photo was taken, and the guests and hosts parted happily.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>The True Value of the Human Body: Human beings have different statuses, whether rich or poor, noble or lowly, intelligent or foolish, virtuous or unworthy. Therefore, there is a distinction between ordinary people and important figures. If you were to assess the true value of their bodies, then regardless of wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness, intelligence or foolishness, virtue or unworthiness, they are all exactly the same. British biologist Dr. I. ErLaW. son recently gave a speech somewhere, giving a chemical analysis of the human body. According to him, taking an ordinary human body weighing one hundred and forty pounds as an example, it can be known that the water contained in this body can fill a ten-gallon bucket. All the fat can make seven bars of soap. All the carbon can make nine hundred pencils. All the phosphorus can make two thousand two hundred match heads. All the magnesium can make a dose of salt. All the iron can make a medium-sized nail. All the lime can whitewash a chicken coop. All the sulfur can kill fleas on a dog. Counting the true value of these materials, calculated at current market prices, you only need five shillings to buy them. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to say that each human body is only worth five shillings.</p>

<p>Our life is very simple because we are a national salvation team. Everything is militarized. Before dawn, a bugle sounds, and hundreds of warriors gather in the open space to practice. When the sun is in the middle of the sky, the bugle sounds again, and we each take a mouthwash utensil to fill with food and satiate our hunger. When the sun sets in the west, the bugle sounds again, and we eat in the same way as before. When the moon rises in the east, the bugle sounds again, and we quickly spread our bedding on the ground, and two or three people cover themselves with a cotton batting and go to rest. If the bugle sounds suddenly, then you can't care whether you are dreaming of being a rich man or having a wonderful dream of a wedding night. You rub your eyes and brave the cold to receive orders.</p>
<p>Our comrades are very loyal. "Everyone eats together when there is food, and everyone does things when there is work." Truly, that's what we all think. But when eating, we are honestly not polite because we are afraid that "politeness" will become a habit. If we are also polite when killing the enemy in the front, wouldn't that be terrible?</p>
<p>We slept in the car for two nights in Nanjing. The form of sleeping was very unique. The first person lay on the shoulder of the second person, and the second person also lay on the shoulder of the third person. It was quite comfortable to lie down like this one by one. However, one comrade had a body as short as a Japanese pirate, so his head could only lean on the arm of the next person. Another comrade had a torso that was particularly thin and long, so his head could press on the neck of the next person. From the moment when the snoring shook the mountains and rivers, I peered around and saw these long and short heads, and couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Sometimes, before going to sleep, we hold a foot-washing conference.</p>
<h3 id="e154">A Letter About the Recent Art Scene in Paris (Part 1) <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Kang</p>
<p>This is a recent letter that comrade Liu Kang sent me from France, describing the situation of the current Autumn Salon in Paris and the lives of artists, which is even more detailed than my previous "European Correspondence." I think there must be many readers who want to hear about the latest news from the Paris art scene, so I asked the editor of this publication to publish this letter. I will briefly declare it as a small introduction. I don't think Liu Kang will blame me for being nosy? January 1, 1932, Hai Li, Shanghai Cuntian Pavilion.</p>
<p>Teacher Hai... I don't know how many times I've started writing, wanting to make a detailed report on the Autumn Exhibition; but... lazy? Busy? I also inexplicably ended up procrastinating without results. This is really unfortunate. This morning, I received a letter from November 9th, reading it made people excited, so I had to start writing again, I think this time I shouldn't fail again!</p>
<p>The Autumn Exhibition opened on October 1st (until December 13th). Generally speaking, it is much the same as last year. The center of attention of the entire venue is again focused on Bonnard's two new works... a landscape of delicate tones and a golden-colored portrait of a girl... one is quiet and mysterious, the other is passionate and active. In short, the means of operating color can be said to have reached the extreme. Asselin has improved a lot compared to last year. Two size 40 portraits of adults and children were appropriately hung next to Bonnard's two, which is very interesting! Because comparing them with each other, one shows the richness of his color, and the other further confirms the solidity of his texture. Kisling's painting this time can be regarded as the crystallization of his lifelong flower paintings, with a very deep interest in porcelain. The female painter Marval's "Dream" writes the fantasy of a young woman's desire for wealth and honor, which is extremely vivid, with gorgeous colors and majestic brushstrokes. Sonverbie's Hellenized figures are both lovely and respectable. Blanc made a very large-scale picture, entitled Before the Wedding; excitement and joy are fully expressed. As for Van Dongen, I feel very sorry for him. The two portraits of celebrities (political celebrity Riberton and Paibleve) do have some unfaithfulness (faithful to art) and insincerity (sincere to people, sincere to oneself) that are below mediocrity. Tempted by profit and fame, the artist's personality is swept away! In addition, Laprade, Espagnat, etc. neither advance nor retreat, just like in previous years, and there is no need to repeat them.</p>
<p>I borrowed a large vat from someone in advance and filled it with clean warm water. Then groups of comrades stretched their legs into the vat to swim. The female comrades were also like this. It was very interesting.</p>
<p>Finally, there are still two-thirds of the journey to the Northeast. We still need to stay in Nanjing for a few days before advancing as a whole division. Compatriots, I wish you all the best for the country. I will report more news from the future later.</p>

<p>— Wei Qi</p>
<p>The national painting style of the China Art College is the purest and most natural in Shanghai. The painting path is unique and upright. Generally, landscapes look up to the Yuan masters from Wen Tang, while flower and bird paintings adhere to the boneless method of hooking in the Northern and Southern Song Dynasties and are imbued with the spirit of Baiyang Xinluo. This is due to the good teaching of masters such as Xin Hu, Shizi Gongzhan, Hongwei Mengrong, Wuchang Manqing, and Jiekang, as well as the good learning of the students, so they were successful. Qi Weixin regards the Art College as his alma mater and is now in charge of teaching in the school. The rules still follow Ma Zheng. It can be said that Xihe is to Zhusi. This time, the school's fourth graduation exhibition is full of masterpieces. Graduates such as Huang Jinghua, Fang Jiangshui, Dai Tinghe, and Zuo Dequan are all excellent choices. Among the students at the school, there are Xu Hui's landscapes, Qu Zongxie's animals, and Lu Xiaying, Liu Shen, Xie Jun, Huang Dacong, and Ding Bao's flower and bird paintings. All of them have brushwork and charm. The autumn harvest has not yet arrived, but the spring flowers are worth appreciating. Lu Cha is a strange sight. The world is in great turmoil. Ms. He Xiangning is advocating saving the country with calligraphy and painting, then the achievements of the Art College's colleagues in art, the contribution to society, and saving and loving the country can all be divined at this meeting.</p>

<p>— Seeking Happiness, the Master of Qi</p>
<p>Chapter 1: A Famous Courtesan Secluded, Misses Her Beautiful Partner, A Student Wandering in a Foreign Land, Builds a Strange Romance</p>
<p>It's just that his temperament is a little frivolous, and he has always lived a life of abundance. With his family constantly supplying his expenses, he inevitably likes to compete with a group of useless friends in recreational and playing fields during his spare time and holidays. Relying on his extraordinary appearance, handsome clothes, generous actions, and refined temperament, he has gatherings with playboys and the flattery of beautiful women everywhere. He almost acts like a playboy. Through a friend who is an English teacher in the Liang family, he got to know this romantic and suave Liang Xiaoyun. Counting the time, they have been friends for seven or eight months, and they can be considered unusually compatible with each other.</p>
<p>He admires her famous beauty, and she admires his handsome luxury. Whenever there are good mornings and evenings, he often comes to her house to open his heart and chat intimately. Occasionally, they also walk hand in hand together, traveling in famous gardens and scenic spots, dancing and singing. At first glance, they look like a beautiful couple. In her heart, this has been through numerous thorough investigations and careful considerations. She deeply feels that An Yutian is like a piece of uncarved jade. Coupled with his masculine demeanor, athletic body, scholarly articles, and chivalrous style, they all meet her ideal lover's conditions. It's just a pity that he is a bit stubborn by nature, and his circumstances are not poor. It seems he cannot lower his head and heart to rely on her pomegranate skirt and obediently obey her command training, acting like a love-captive gentleman. If he only seeks harmony and is merely a temporary union of wild mandarin ducks between the Sang and Jian rivers, or compromises and humbly retreats to a side room like the story of Lian Qing, who pities her fate, then all of this is beyond her original wishes and cannot be accommodated in this way. Moreover, it would needlessly change her original intention and lose the entire game, which is no different from lightly cutting off this opportunity and turning it into a mistake that is too hasty. How can she know that if she persists, there may not be a gap to take advantage of? Therefore, she is cautious and expectant, hesitant and hesitant, and has never revealed any trace of what to look for. And An Yutian is broad-minded and careless. Although he feels that this exquisite and transparent beauty is a rare beauty, often between intentional and unintentional, their hearts are in sync, and their eyes are provocative, which is indeed not bad for him. However, looking closely at her noble and invincible demeanor, she seems to have a demeanor worthy of an immortal.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Financial and Gold Market Entering a Slump <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>▲ Tael Gold Falls Back 8.60 Taels Yesterday's benchmark gold price showed weakness again. However, the morning market started calmly with a slight surplus, about two taels. The afternoon market suddenly became turbulent, breaking through 690 taels, with a total fluctuation of more than 10 taels throughout the day. It finally fell back around 9 taels. However, there were no large transactions. Generally, supply exceeded demand. Dealers' attitudes were uncertain. The silver dollar rose slightly, but the silver price remained unchanged. Therefore, the opening price stabilized. Foreign exchange seemed loose, but major players in the market competed to sell, driving prices lower. Suddenly, in the evening, it was reported that Germany was buying silver bars, further fueling the selling spree. Both British and American exchange rates felt particularly loose, causing the gold price to plunge by more than 8 taels, retreating from 94 taels to 87 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Morning Opening Still Able to Stabilize The morning opening rose slightly by 8 cents to 697.5 taels. Although major firms extended long positions by one-eighth and forward positions by one-sixteenth, American silver remained unchanged, so it was not considered a significant move. However, transactions among various firms were complex. Initially, Yuan Mao Yong, Wu Pin, and others bought, while Yi Feng sold. With initial British gold purchases by the bank at 1.875, followed by forward contracts settling at the same price, the price immediately dropped by more than 2 taels, settling at only 95.1 taels. The listed price for British gold did not change. The US dollar shrank by 125, then increased to 5.7 taels during exchange settlement. Subsequently, Heng Yu, Yi Feng, Zhi Feng, and Yong sold, showing a looser US dollar. Dong Ya bought July at 3.0625 yuan, and An Da absorbed April British gold at 25, immediately dropping the price to 93.7 taels. In a blink, it returned to 5.7 taels. A January British gold at 25 could be sold. Then, the Silver Company bought US dollars at 32.875. After 10:15, the market suddenly turned weak. Qian Chang Xiang, Zhi Feng, Yong, Da De Cheng, Wu Pin, and others rushed to sell, coupled with Mitsui selling US dollars at 3 yuan, causing the price to plummet by more than 4 taels. At nearly 11 o'clock, it was 91.3 taels. Then, banks cross-traded March at 3 yuan, Sumitomo absorbed 3.0625 yuan, and Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Chang, Heng Yu, Shun Li, and others pulled in, raising the price by more than 2 taels. At 11:30, it was 93.8 taels, then depreciated by 1 tael, and closed at 93.4 taels at noon. Wu Pin bought again, adding more than 4 taels, revising the listed price to 747 taels, calculated at a premium of 52-53 taels to 56 taels. At noon, 52-53 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Germany Buys Again, Market Trend Gradually Low The afternoon market opened at 94.5 taels, a residual effect from the noon closing. Subsequently, it increased by 4.1 cents to 4.9 cents, with retail buyers entering. The exchange market was flat, and dealers settled March US dollars at 2.875 yuan. Banks cross-traded January British gold at 25. Yi Feng Yong and others slightly sold at 2:30, settling at 93.5 taels. Mitsui bought April at 25, then at 3 o'clock it was 94.3 taels. Afterward, the market gradually weakened. Because British gold cross-traded at 3125, US dollars could be settled at 3 yuan. Sellers in the market were excited, but Yi Feng was able to hold steady at 92 taels due to limit orders. Unexpectedly, after 3:45, news suddenly spread that Germany was buying silver, causing the atmosphere to deteriorate sharply. Zhi Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Heng Yu, Hong Kang Yong Yu He, and others all rushed to sell, and various firms indiscriminately sold off, especially with short-term British gold settling at 375 and US dollars at 3.125 difficult to sell, requiring a premium of 1.875. As a result, waves arose, plummeting by 5-6 taels, breaking through 90 taels until, at 4:20, it finally reached 86.5 taels. At that time, Fu Yu, Da Lian, and others slightly bought, briefly pulling the price up by 2 taels to 88.5 taels (reportedly, there were transactions at 9 taels). At 4:38, the market closed at 88.1 taels, a decrease of 8.6 taels compared to the previous day. Further trading occurred at 7 taels and some change. The day's highest benchmark gold price was 97.5 taels, and the lowest was 86.5 taels, a difference of 11 taels. Wu Pin's morning market was 97 taels, noon closing was 4 taels and a half, afternoon 4 taels 8 cents, and closing market was 87 taels, revealing that the listed price was calculated with a premium of 6 taels, registering 95 taels to 93 taels, and in the afternoon, 90 taels to 88 taels, with water added to 95 taels, and 90 taels in the afternoon. The bare gold bar was calculated with an addition of 9 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Small Trading Volume, Supply Exceeds Demand Although trading on the counter was bustling, there were no statistics for the number of transactions. Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Kang Xiang, Fu Tai Heng, Shun Li, Heng Xing, Fu Chang, and others all bought. Zhi Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Hong Kang Yong, Yi Feng, Da De Cheng, Yu Da, Da Kang, and others all sold. Yuan Tai, Heng Yu, Yi Feng Yong, Tian Feng Yong, and Wu Pin covered short positions and then sold again. In the afternoon, Yi Feng, Tong Tai Chang, and Bing Xing all bought. Yi Feng Yong, Fu Yu, Fu Tai Heng, Yuan Tai, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Chang Yong, and others had frequent entries and exits. Zhi Feng Yong and Qian Chang Xiang sold about 1,000 or more taels. Da Kang, Yuan Xing Yong, Heng Yu, Yuan Da Yong, and Hong Kang Yong all sold, while those covering US dollar shorts bought. Da Lian still had no substantial transactions, with only about 200 taels bought throughout the day and several dozen taels sold. Guangdong firms sold 600 taels and bought 400 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Foreign Exchange Declines <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>▲ Most Gold Businesses Sell Off... Transactions Not Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, British silver rose and American silver remained unchanged, and the market was quite flat. However, foreign exchange still tended to be low. British to American was 3.38 yuan, American to British was 3.39375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were, like the US dollar, reduced by 125 to 32.125 yuan, and the French franc was slightly reduced by 4 yuan. German exchange decreased by 1 mark, and Hong Kong added 125, totaling 76.125. Other currencies such as British Indian and Singapore remained unchanged. The bank initially appeared flat internally, then loosened, and in the afternoon, it appeared especially weak. As a result, compared to the previous day, British gold rose by 1.875 and the US dollar also rose by 3.125. In fact, the gold price had retreated to the 690 tael mark, because it was rumored that Germany continued to buy silver for silver coin use. Large silver bars were expected to lengthen, causing market conditions to appear weak. Transactions in the gold industry were still considered lively, with most selling off. About 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded, and about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan of US dollars. Mumbai telegraphed sales of March contracts in the morning, but American Silver Company bought them. Gold firms had unequal inflows and outflows, mostly covering short positions.</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange Inner market has a difference of 25 points all day. The bank buys the most short-term, at 1 shilling, 11 pence, 1875, and the loosest is 1 shilling, 11 pence, 4375. From the morning market, the asking price was 1 shilling, 11 pence, 1875, and the buying price was 1 shilling, 11 pence, 25 to 1875. HSBC first absorbed January at 1 shilling, 11 pence, 1875. Mitsui offered April at the same price. An Da bought April at 1 shilling, 11 pence, 25. Hua Bi offered, and Zheng Jin bought January at 1 shilling, 11 pence, 25. The afternoon asking price was 1 shilling, 11 pence, 25 to 1875, and the buying price was 1 shilling, 11 pence, 3125 to 25. In the afternoon, Taiwan offered and Mai Jia Li bought, cross-trading January at 1 shilling, 11 pence, 25. Mitsui bought 1 shilling, 11 pence, April at 1 shilling, 11 pence, 25. Yun Tong and Holland, and Taiwan and Hua Bi, all cross-traded January and January at 1 shilling, 11 pence, 3125. The closing asking price was 1 shilling, 11 pence, 375 to 3125, and the buying price was 1 shilling, 11 pence, 4375 to 375. Short-term was still looser and long-term tighter, but the difference was no more than 0.0625.</p>
<p>▲ American Exchange The inner market fluctuated by 3125 throughout the day. The bank buys the furthest term, at 32.875 yuan, and the loosest is 33.1875 yuan. The morning market asking price was 32.75 yuan, and the buying price was 32.875 yuan. Mitsui initially bought March at 32.875 yuan (Mumbai order). Dong Ya bought July at 33.0625 yuan. Zhong Fu offered March at 32.875 yuan. Korea offered the same price (American Silver Company bought). Shanghai He Feng Sumitomo bought March at 3 yuan. Mitsui's asking price was the same as Dong Ya's offer of April at 32.9375 yuan. Mitsui and He Feng cross-traded March at 33 yuan. Sumitomo bought March at 33.0625 yuan.

You Li and Zheng Jin cross-traded June at 33 yuan. Korea offered the same price in February. Mitsui and Hua Bi bought May at 33.125 after 4 o'clock. The closing asking price was 33.0625 yuan, and the buying price was 33.1875 yuan. The American dollar was listed at 1 yuan, equivalent to 3 taels, 1 qian, 1 fen, 284.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Silver Bars Lengthen, Silver Stabilizes <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegrams, silver bars turned longer again, with short-term lengthening by 125 and long-term lengthening by 0625, both at 20 pence. Short sellers made slight covering purchases, and the market was calm. The aftermarket was still flat. The United States was uncertain and unsettled. Also received from New York telegrams, American silver price had not been enlarged or shrunk, with the spot price at 2 jiao 9 fen 875, British to American dropped 2 fen to 3 yuan 3 jiao 8 fen, and American to British also dropped slightly 625 to 3 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 375. British Shanghai shilling lengthened 125 to 1 shilling 11 pence half. Mumbai was closed, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Silver Dollar Market Unusually Slack <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview The financial industry in the 20th year was affected by various major impacts, especially the occurrence of many unfortunate difficulties in commerce, resulting in economic conditions that could not be remedied. Financial adjustments were very difficult. Although the transition through the year-end was said to be smooth, the majority of difficult hurdles lie in the abolition of the traditional Chinese New Year (i.e., mid-early February in the Gregorian calendar). Therefore, the current distance is not far, and financial constraints are precisely due to this major malady. It is appropriate that the current market is bleak and the public is idle, a situation even more pronounced than in previous years. Yesterday, the unremarkable tranquility of the interest rate on the money market was almost entirely due to this.</p>
<p>▲ Interest Rate Prices [Foreign Interest] The early market interest rate was 7 qian 1 fen 5 li 3 hao 7 suddenly half. The noon market was 7 qian 1 fen 5 li half. As a result, it seemed to rise by half a li compared to the early market of the previous day, but the public remained weary. [Silver Discount] Due to the relationship of balanced demand, the early and noon markets were mostly weak, both at 6 fen, which was 4 fen smaller than the early market of the previous day, causing listed prices to have no market price to list, and the headline allowance ultimately had no water to add.</p>
<p>▲ Auxiliary Coin Market Conditions The Jiangnan small dollar was largely the same as the previous day, calculated at 6 qian 5 fen 7 li half for both the early and noon markets, with 4,000 jiao of transactions in the early market and 3,000 jiao in the noon market. The Guangdong small dollar was also the same in both the early and noon markets, calculated at 6 qian 5 fen 7 li 7 hao, with 155,000 jiao of transactions in the early market and 25,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins shrunk by 1,000 wen to 372,000 wen, with over 28,000 strings of transactions.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Dollar Inflows and Outflows [Silver Funds] Yesterday, the bank's receipt and remittance were very simple. Chinese merchant receipts and remittances totaled over 1.5 million, foreign merchant receipts and remittances totaled over 1.5 million, and various goods, exchange, tax, and miscellaneous funds totaled 6.45 million. The amount released from the warehouse was 80 million. Money shops and silver public receipts and remittances totaled over 4.1 million, headline allowance receipts and remittances totaled over 3.2 million, various route remittances totaled over 700,000, and cash receipts totaled 500,000 to 600,000. [Foreign Funds] Exchange and remittance drafts made 990,000 in the early market and 968,000 in the noon market. Banknotes were only 40,000 in the noon market. Off-market banknotes were 100,050 in the early market and 70,000 in the noon market. Bank transactions were 750,000 in the early market and 650,000 in the noon market. Incoming and outgoing receipts and remittances between various bank foreign accounts totaled over 1.2 million. Banknote redemption and issuance totaled over 1.5 million. Money shops and foreign public receipts and remittances totaled over 4.4 million. Foreign headline allowance receipts and remittances totaled over 1.3 million. Borrowing and lending of foreign funds totaled over 1.1 million. Small money shop transactions totaled 400,000 to 500,000. Guest route outflows totaled over 300,000.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Securities and Bond Prices Fall by About One Yuan <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>▲ Public Sentiment Pessimistic, Supply Exceeds Demand</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions of various bonds in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange continued to weaken, and trading in the forward market was quite lively in both the early and late markets. Various bonds expiring in February were also actively traded, and there were many types of spot openings. The market conditions were also more vigorous than the previous day. The circumstances of the various bonds were due to the deterioration of the diplomatic situation and the increasingly serious Northeast problem, while the internal situation in our country was still unusually chaotic, with no one in charge of the central government and the future quite worrying. The market, in light of this situation, was generally pessimistic, and public sentiment was increasingly pessimistic. Except for slight purchases by retail investors, major investors were extremely indifferent, and the selling side, although there were no large-scale sell-offs, sporadic selling was quite active. Therefore, the market supply exceeded demand, and prices turned weak again, continuing the downward trend from the end of last week, but the trend was still relatively peaceful, as the various prices gradually circled lower without major changes. As a result, only the consolidated tax spot goods slightly improved by several jiao compared to the previous day, such as troop reduction in 19 and Customs in February, each falling by 2 yuan and 2 jiao, while others also fell by 7-8 jiao to 1 yuan and several jiao. Only the 96 price remained unchanged. The 20-volume futures only had small numbers of jiao. Looking at the market situation of bonds, it is temporarily feared that it will be difficult to improve, because the current circumstances are still not optimistic. Total spot goods transactions were 47,000 yuan. Futures were 3.25 million in the morning market and over 2.3 million in the afternoon market, totaling 5,585,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Yarn, Flower, and Cotton Yarn Trends Slightly Favorable <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly better, but the trend is still flat. The situation in the current month is relatively tight because the actual sales recently have been good, and the yarn in the warehouse is scarce, leading to good public sentiment and speculative covering of short positions. However, the current situation is still bad, and the Japanese invasion is still intense, making it difficult to loosen finances, so the overall situation is one of calm.</p>
<p>▲ Recent Benchmark Rises by 7-8 Cents In the early market, human benchmarks opened with the current month's situation firm, rising by 7 cents, and distant months also rose by 3, 4, 5, or 6 cents. In the afternoon, near months rose by 1, 2, or 3 cents, and distant months were flat. Total transactions were recorded at 15,200 bales. Geng Feng sold 1,200 bales, Da Chang sold 1,300 bales, and Shen Chang sold 400 bales. Xin Cheng bought 1,600 bales, and Tai Xing bought 500 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>▲ Current Demand Still Strong Current yarn sales are still good. The total number of bales bought by various groups throughout the day was recorded at 1,200. The market was flat. Shantou guest group bought 90 bales, Guangdong bought 275 bales, inland bought 130 bales, Luzhou bought 25 bales, Sichuan bought 625 bales, and miscellaneous groups bought 20 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Cotton Market Suddenly Turns Tight <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>▲ It Is Said That Japanese Merchants Are Receiving Goods This Month</p>
<p>The cotton market has turned firm because it is said that this month, Japanese merchants have entrusted Indian merchants to receive and deliver goods to Japanese factories, causing the market situation to suddenly turn tight. Therefore, the rising wind has suddenly risen. However, the actual sales of various factories have not yet been initiated, and the US cotton situation is still flat, so a portion is still pessimistic about the future situation. It is still difficult to predict, but there may be upward momentum.</p>
<p>▲ The Atmosphere in the Han Benchmark Market Has Improved, and Transactions are Lively The early market in the exchange's Han Benchmark was tighter this month, with each month rising by 1-2 qian. In the afternoon, each month rose by another 1.5 qian. Total transactions were recorded at 57,300 dan. Gong Tai sold 1,100 dan, Shen Chang sold 2,600 dan, Yi Yu sold 2,000 dan, Yuan Da sold 1,600 dan, and Yi Feng sold 1,100 dan. Da Chang bought 1,100 dan, Xin Cheng bought 3,900 dan, Gong Tai bought 1,200 dan, Tai Xing bought 6,100 dan, and Tong Xing bought 3,100 dan.

<p>Yesterday, US cotton was calm and firm due to dealers buying in to cover household shorts, and there was a lack of sellers. Futures rose 1 to 6 pounds, spot goods remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose 3-4 points, spot goods rose 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose 5 points. Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded below (11th telegram):</p>

<p>▲ Shanghai South Yesterday about a dozen ships arrived at rural stores. Due to the relaxation of foreign rice and weak public sentiment, transactions were sluggish. The price of Suchang white japonica rice was weak, with a slight corner discount. The arrival of thin rice was limited, and the sales market was quite active. Foreign company sharp rice arrived with steady sales, and the market was also stable. The reason for the change was that the continuous price decline made arrivals gradually scarce. Selecting high-quality rice slightly moved, and the market rose by an angle.</p>
<p>▲ Xinzha Yesterday over 30 boats arrived, mostly from Kunshan and Songjiang. The activity of city stores was not seen. Changxi white japonica rice was still heavily stocked, and public sentiment was flat. Thick and thin japonica rice was reduced by one jiao. There was not much sharp rice in foreign ports, and the price followed the original trend. Although there was limited arrival, it was also dull and the price was short. Early rice went on the dock near 1000 shi, the price rose by half an angle.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Spot Foreign Rice Sales Active, Showing Slight Improvement <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of spot foreign rice on this street were very good, and the market showed a turning point. If sales continue smoothly today and tomorrow, the market price will rise. Total transactions were very active, with 3000 bags of small twist rice opening at 9 yuan 5 jiao half to 9 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen, 1000 bags of Saigon number one at 10 yuan 7 jiao half, 500 bags of Minchou rice at 9 yuan 5 jiao half. New futures transactions were not opened. Huelong opened 200-300 tons each of small twist, Min Dang, and Saigon, and the market was also steady.</p>

<p>▲ Guest Groups Draw and Buy This Month's Factory Chips</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the afternoon, each month tended to be firm and rising. Foreign wheat quotations continued to be good by about 3 jiao. The factory chips for this month were successively drawn by guest groups. Yesterday, groups such as Shandong and Tianjin also drew about 100,000 bags. Because the current benchmark market value is actually very cheap, distributors from foreign ports can all calculate it, so although the year-end is near, the sales are more vigorous. The near and far terms saw a boost due to good actual sales. The trend of May and June, when factory dumping was very quiet, was also good. As a result, this month rose by 7 li and a half from the previous day, February rose by 1 fen and a half, March and April rose by 1 fen and 2 li and a half, May rose by 2 fen and 6 li, and June rose by 2 fen and a half, it is said.</p>

<p>▲ Distant-term Short Positions are Heavily Covered</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market in day-term wheat showed an initial stabilization and continued to rise. Due to the delivery relationship in the current month, there were very few entries and exits. Distant-term short positions were covered, and because the flour market turned up, public sentiment also improved. According to the current situation, if foreign wheat does not create a setback, the needs of the factory can be expected to increase. If so, the foundation of the wheat market may turn stable. However, the button for rising and falling still depends on whether foreign wheat can come to a peak. As a result, the current month rose by 2 fen and 2 from the previous day, February rose by 6 fen, March rose by 5 fen, April and May rose by 6 fen, and June rose by 5 fen, it is said.</p>

<p>▲ Golden Needles Recently, the sales of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shantou groups have become more active, and the market situation has rebounded. The number of transactions for several consecutive days has been quite considerable. The sales in Guangdong and Hong Kong have been sluggish for a long time. Now that the market price has reached a low level, they have started to stock up in preparation for spring sales. The selling price has risen by more than 2 taels from before. Yesterday, the selling price of top-quality vegetables in the city was around 23 taels, and gradually from 21 taels to 17-18 taels, with the trend gradually entering a stable path.</p>
<p>▲ Fungus The asking price for Sichuan goods is no less than 70 taels. The current market has risen to 72 taels. It is even more difficult to negotiate the price in the Han market, with a difference of 10 taels. The sales here have suddenly increased recently, and the selling price has rebounded by 4-5 taels for several consecutive days. Ordinary miscellaneous fungus sells for 70 taels, and higher-quality goods are priced higher. Guangdong groups have also taken action because the price has rebounded, so there is hope for the future, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port was still difficult to activate. Although there was a telegram from New York regarding the silk from Bai Li, the New York Raw Silk Exchange only opened the recent silk at 1.61 US dollars per pound and the distant-term silk at 1.70 US dollars. The price was still difficult to rise. Yesterday, Bai Li bought 10 packages of Huang Raw, and Shen Yu and others bought 15 packages of Gan Da Raw. The price was still flat and weak.</p>

<p>▲ Silk Ben Still Needs to Pull 850-860 Taels Per Hundred Catties</p>
<p>Last year, the spring raw in various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang suffered from improper weather conditions. The cocoon production was great, the cocoon quality was less than ideal, and there were more inferior products. According to statistics, the spring cocoons produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were not enough for the various silk factories to produce. Fortunately, the sales in Europe and the United States plummeted, and there was still some surplus of spring cocoons, and the bottom had the price of cocoons. The current market price of ordinary spring dry cocoons is 520-30 catties, which converts to a cocoon price of 163-4 taels per dan. Silk ben still needs to pull 850-60 taels per hundred catties.</p>

<p>│Who are they busying themselves for, rushing back and forth?</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway seems to have been specially built for important people. Going to Beijing and leaving Beijing, rushing back and forth. If someone were to record the important people coming and going on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway every day of the year, they could compile a very thick record of the comings and goings of dignitaries on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway every year.</p>
<p>To prove my point, I randomly picked up this newspaper from New Year's Day onwards and checked the itineraries of the people of the time recorded each day. The result of the inspection... was that on December 31st of the twentieth year, Zhu Peide, Zhu Lixue, and Yang Hu left Beijing and arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM that afternoon. That evening, Yu Youren, Chen Shaokuan, and Kong Xiangxi went to Beijing. There were no reports for the five days after New Year's Day, so the itineraries of important people during these five days cannot be checked. Chen Mingshu arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 7th; Zhang Jingjiang, Liu Luyin, and Liu Ruiheng arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 8th. That evening, Chen Shaokuan, Zhu Jiahua, Tang Shengzhi, and Ye Kaixin went to Beijing; Sun Ke, Huang Liang, and Yu Youren arrived in Shanghai on the 9th. That evening, Chen Mingshu went to Beijing; He Yingqin and Chen Youren arrived in Shanghai on the 10th. That evening, Chen returned to Beijing; Chu Minyi left Beijing on the evening of the 11th. That evening, Liu Ruiheng went to Beijing. Chu arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 12th. From December 31st of last year to today, excluding five days, which is only a week, the records of important people coming to Shanghai and going to Beijing are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Officials have official duties, and those who are officials should abide by their [duties] and uphold their [responsibilities]. They should not lightly leave their posts unless absolutely necessary, especially in these times of national crisis. Those who are officials should diligently attend to their duties, so much so that they fear that not even working day and night is enough to alleviate the national crisis and meet the people's expectations. We dare to ask this group of important people going to Beijing and leaving Beijing, rushing back and forth on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, what exactly are they doing?</p>
<p>Nanjing is the political center, and major plans concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood should be handled in Nanjing. Apart from the new Minister of Finance, Huang Hanliang, who has to come to Shanghai to discuss raising funds and liaise with the financial community, what exactly are the rest coming to Shanghai for? For the national economy and the people's livelihood? But Shanghai is not a political center!</p>
<p>If it is not for the national economy and the people's livelihood, not for official business, then it must be for private affairs. They eat the food of the common people and take the money of the common people. When the country is in crisis and the people are suffering, they leisurely travel to Shanghai for private affairs, ignoring politics and neglecting their duties. They come and go on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, requiring specially prepared free railway cars and specially dispatched soldiers to greet and send them off. In addition to the individual, they sometimes bring their wives, young masters, young ladies, and a large group of attendants and orderlies. This is not only dereliction of duty, not only failing the country and the people, but also harming the country and the people. What do we the people need such officials for?</p>
<p>When Mr. Hu Hanmin was the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, he never left Beijing and never came to Shanghai. This is a point worth praising. An [official] who bears heavy political responsibilities often comes to this Shanghai of gilded palaces and dissipated pleasures. Whether he still has the leisure to consider the national economy and the people's livelihood is self-evident! What exactly are you, a group of people rushing back and forth on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, doing?</p>

<p>My teacher, Mr. Qi Fu, who does not remove the weeds in his courtyard, wrote three New Year songs in the 17th year of the Republic of China, which are quite sufficient to warn the world.

<p>Scrape! Yi Xin heard this loud sound and ran into the room in a panic, seeing a crushed small tin can in a basin on the table. His brother, Huan Xin, stood beside him grinning, looking very happy.</p>
<p>Yi Xin│Brother! What was that sound just now?</p>
<p>Huan Xin│[I'm doing an interesting experiment.</p>
<p>Look, isn't there a crushed tin can in the middle of this basin of water? This tin can was originally a good one. Just now, with a scrape, it was the sound it made when it acted up.]</p>
<p>Yi Xin│[How did it make that sound, and how did it get crushed?]</p>
<p>Huan Xin│[I took a good can, opened a small round hole in the middle of the top of the can, took out the vegetables, poured in a quarter of water, lit a fire to boil it, and then tightly sealed the hole with a wooden stopper (if it's not tight, or apply fire lacquer or other things that can seal the hole).</p>
<p>) Put it in the basin of water. After only five or six minutes, it scraped, and the tin can suddenly collapsed.]</p>
<p>Yi Xin│[What's the reason for this?]</p>
<p>Huan Xin│[Because there was only a quarter of water in the tin can. After being boiled by the fire, the steam completely expelled the air in the can. The top was sealed, with only full of steam inside. When it was thrown into the basin of cold water, after about five or six minutes, the steam cooled down and completely turned into cold water. The tin can became a vacuum. We know that the atmospheric pressure is very high, about fifteen pounds of pressure per square inch. The can cooled down, and there was nothing inside except a little water, so it was subjected to atmospheric pressure and collapsed with a scrape. The reason why the can collapsed was originally because of the pressure of the large amount of air outside. Isn't this an interesting thing?]</p>

<p>This banking king, Z. B. Morgan, started by selling the art collection that his father loved and obtaining a lot of cash. At that time, everyone in his family opposed it in unison, and people gave him selfish and stingy bad reviews. However, the stubborn and confident Z. B. ignored the opposition of his family and the criticism of the world, and silently carried out his confidence. Then, was he really stingy? In fact, it was definitely not like that.</p>
<p>In fact, all that his father left him were these art collections and property equal to the debts he owed, such as worthless stocks and 19 million in cash. However, he had to pay 3 million in inheritance tax, had to distribute the property according to the will, and had to operate a huge business. Therefore, he was indeed in the difficult situation of having to sell the art collection that his father loved. He resolutely carried it out, and then he saved the family fortune and succeeded as the great banking king Morgan. Therefore, he not only became the ruler of the American financial world, but also lent 1.5 billion yuan to the Allied countries during the war, absorbed millions of gold blocks from Europe, and saved the European countries from the brink of life and death with millions of yuan of weapons and food. Sure enough, he became an even greater banking king than his father.</p>

<p>[My copper mine is about to go bankrupt now, can you help me?] Guggenheim's friend asked him.</p>

<p>Guggenheim, who was rich in friendship and chivalry, took out money to save his friend's copper mine. This was the beginning of his copper kingdom.</p>
<p>After he decided to help his friend run the copper mine, he carefully planned it in his mind, and then he called his sons to talk.</p>
<p>[We don't know when the business we are doing now will develop. Let's join forces to engage in copper mining.]</p>
<p>The sons all agreed very much, so his copper mining business started from then on. Especially his third son, Daniel, was even more daring. Soon, a large copper mining kingdom with an annual output of 500,000 tons, accounting for one-half of the world's industry, was built in this way.</p>
<p>If anyone asked Daniel Guggenheim's secret to success, he would immediately answer:</p>

<p>×The Earliest Trade and Tariffs</p>
<p>After the opening of the trading port, the Su Song Tai Dao designated six money shops to issue receipts for import and export taxes and tonnage dues. British Consul Balfour protested, believing that it violated the treaty, for fear that British business would be monopolized by a few people. The British Consul originally wanted to stipulate that tariffs would not be paid before foreign goods arrived at the port and were sold, but this was rejected by the Imperial Commissioner.</p>
<p>Within the first six weeks after the opening of the port, that is, from November 14th to December 31st, only seven merchant ships entered the port. The total value of imported goods was 433,729 taels, and the total value of exported goods was 147,172 taels. The import tax collected was 16,564 taels and 8 mace; the export tax was 7,537 taels, 1 mace, and 9 fen. A total of 985 taels of tonnage dues were collected, which was much lower than the tonnage dues previously collected in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>×The Beginning of Extraterritoriality</p>
<p>The so-called extraterritoriality means that foreigners in Chinese territory are not subject to Chinese law but are subject to the jurisdiction of their country's consuls stationed in China, so it is also called consular jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Nanjing did not explicitly recognize that foreigners enjoyed extraterritoriality in Chinese trading ports, but Articles 15, 16, and 17 of the Sino-British Supplementary Treaty in May of the eighth year of Xianfeng, as well as Articles 22 and 28 of the Sino-American Treaty in May of the same year, explicitly recognized that foreigners enjoyed extraterritoriality in Chinese trading ports.</p>
<p>Article 17 of the Sino-British Supplementary Treaty in the eighth year of Xianfeng stated; [In the event that British nationals accuse Chinese nationals, they should first go to the consular office to file a complaint. The consul should immediately investigate the cause and first try to resolve the matter peacefully to avoid litigation. If Chinese people go to the consul to accuse British nationals, the consul should also try to resolve the matter peacefully. If the matter cannot be resolved peacefully, the Chinese local officials and the consul shall jointly try the case fairly.]</p>
<p>Article 27 of the Sino-American Treaty says··[If citizens of the United States have disputes over property in Chinese trading ports, they shall be investigated and handled by their consuls and other officials. If citizens of the United States have disputes with people trading in China from other countries, both parties should be heard and handled in accordance with the treaties established by their respective countries. Chinese officials shall not interfere.]</p>
<p>Article 28 also says··</p>
<p>[If citizens of the United States have important matters to litigate with Chinese local officials, they should first report to the consuls and other officials. After confirming that the wording in the report is clear and the matter is reasonable, they will forward it to the local officials for investigation. Chinese merchants are allowed to submit reports to the local officials on the one hand and to the consuls and other officials on the other hand for investigation. If Chinese people and citizens of the United States have disputes that cannot be resolved peacefully, the officials of the two countries must investigate, discuss, and decide on the matter fairly. No fees may be charged, and people may be invited to the court to act as interpreters to avoid misunderstandings due to language barriers]</p>
<p>Since the signing of these treaties, foreigners have been able to enjoy extraterritoriality in Chinese territory and are not subject to Chinese law. Therefore, bandits run rampant within the concessions, committing all kinds of evil. Shanghai has become a den of sin in the Far East, all due to these unequal treaties.</p>
