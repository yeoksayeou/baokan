<p>今日本報要目</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>所謂（亞細亞經濟聯盟）之前路又玄</h3>
<p>（現金徧在）爲今日市面衰微之根本原因。（商品過剩）亦當前經濟恐慌之基幹底流。是故現世各國。無不自固其藩籬。增高其關税壁壘。一則防止現金之流出。再則阻止外貨輸入。提倡自國製品輸出。然而各國彼此皆取相同政策。國際貿易乃不能不遭受非常阻滯。經濟市面之不况。乃日益加甚。景氣之轉機。遂愈不可期。各强國處此危機四伏之時自不能不求更生之道於是乃捨棄國際合作而力謀（自給自足）其道爲何。則經濟的聯盟是也。</p>
<p>當今世界領地最廣。人種最雜。出産極豐。而矛盾亦最顯露者。首推大英帝國自渥太華經濟會議而後。實質上名義上。均已抛棄其君臨世界之自由貿易主義。實行保護政策。向自給自足之途狂奔猛進。法國欲獨攬歐洲大陸覇權。指導（歐洲）各小邦。形成經濟同盟。前外長白利安提倡以來雖未竟成。但迄今未嘗須臾忘懷英帝國之經濟聯合將更剌激法蘭西之未來企圖。北美合衆國天賦獨厚。歐戰而後。其經濟的優勢早巳駕乎英國之上。而南北美諸國。又當然歸（門羅主義）領導之下。是以合衆國羣之經濟聯盟其形跡雖未嘗明顯。而實際却巳無形中成立。且兩洋相隔。更具自然的形勢。新興之蘇聯。地跨歐亞其地雖大多貧瘠而面積占全世界大陸六分之一。人口亦超過一萬萬六千萬。俄羅斯大革命以後。乃奮發有爲。近乃另成一勢力。赫然與上述諸國對立。盡量發揮其固有功能。形成獨特之經濟系統。</p>
<p>日本處此經濟的狂潮之中。縱肆意發揮其軍事蠻力强横侵略東北三省。而其國内劣弱諸點乃更見敗露。世界經濟恐慌發生以來之種種現象。如商品停滯。如失業人數增加。如農村衰敗。如中小工商業之倒閉等等險惡景象。皆可委諸人事。姑暫置勿論。而其國天産微薄。彼地下埋藏之鐵爲數不過一億噸。而煤炭礦埋藏量最大限。亦不過八十億噸需要同於赤血之石油。縱併台灣在内。亦僅十二億樽。其窮乏之甚。在亞細亞洲之地位。實有同於歐洲之意大利。空自誇傲。設一旦遇强敵。中國而能自强者。日本圖存。豈屬容易。彼固自知其劣點。又目撃英美法蘇諸國各成一羣。設爲經濟的聯鑿。致各小國皆爲其衛星。以鞏固其經濟勢力。日本當此。亦難安於故常。乃極力圖謀。以武力侵奪東北三省。除經濟的支配之外。復擴大其政治的支。配以爲自今以後。（滿蒙）皆巳入其囊槖矣。於是發揮其野心。大倡其（亞細亞經濟聯盟）所謂（東亞門羅主義。）其意則曰日本在東亞應處於絶對　支配地位。同時即據此地位。而與英美法蘇諸國相頡頽。我國亦在此種雰圍中爲所蹂躪。在日本固屬夜郎自大。氣呑一世。而實際情况則何如。自日軍侵略東北之後。彼所借口之惟事件。厥爲當地安寗秩序。而九一八事變前南滿路没綫每月被襲繋事件。平均不過四五十件。戰爭旣起。秩序乃因日軍之維持而愈不可收拾。茲僅依據日方材料。以作最客觀之正視。</p>
<p>南滿鐵路被襲繋次數（九一八戰爭之後）試舉如次</p>
<p>去年十一月中旬（十日間）　　三百四十二件（上海每日所報）</p>
<p>本年二月上旬（十日間）　　　五百七十二件（關東廳報告）</p>
<p>本年七月中旬（十日間）　　　四百二十九件（東京時事新聞）</p>
<p>本年七月下旬（十日間）　　　六百三十四件（東京時事新聞）</p>
<p>準上所述。皆爲日報記載。此足以評定日方所高倡之自衛與夫所謂（東亞門羅主義。）究有如何價値。</p>
<p>且日本之爲輕工業國家。彼自己亦審知之。縱具有若干金副資本的形勢。其實力亦至爲微薄苟善能自愛誠决對華而不行侵略。尙不難繼續保持其强國之勢。乃不此之圖。妄思併呑我中國。以爲囊括三省。則（門羅主義）之恨基巳固亞東牛耳穏執手中。豈知中國雖一時未能團結一致。與之疆塲鐵血的爭鬭。而民族仇恨已深種乎華人腦中。今日義勇軍之殊死作戰。足以表示我華堅毅不屈之熊度。是則是本所謂亞細亞經聯盟者。在國際間爲一新生癌腫。對東亞亦促成另一釁端。縱彼自認侵略爲别開生面之工具。而實際則仍屬帝國主義之末路也。所謂經濟聯盟者。果能成爲事實乎。日本軍力之保障。亦同於往事。僅暫時勝利耳。最後决定。究竟誰屬須視吾人之努力何如以卜之。</p>

<p>以上係最後修正結果、查此次選舉趨勢、最可注意者厥爲國家社會黨社會民主黨中央黨勢力之衰减、與國權黨共産黨票數之大增、蓋東普魯農民紛紛擁護巴本、故國權黨票數比上届雙增三分之一、又不滿意社會民主黨或國家社會黨者、相率擁護共産黨、故其票數比上届亦增一成以上、再上届國會中、國家社會黨中央黨與巴威人民黨聯保後、可占大多數議席、故在一時間曾有組織聯合内閣之趨勢、今則三黨合計祇有百分之四八·二、巳不能居大多數、惟擁護巴本内閣之國權黨·德意志人民黨·農黨等、不過六十餘席、故料國家社會黨如拒絶與巴本合作參加内閣、則政府於必要時、或將再度解散國會、而選舉修改憲法會議云、</p>
<p>哈瓦期六日柏林電　衆院改選情形、據最先報告觀之、一般人事前之推測、在大體上似巳證實、國家社會黨自一九三○年九月以來、進步神速、此次則喪失一部分之勢力、然仍不失爲德國第一大黨、國權黨及共産黨、此次顯有進展、國權黨爲現政府唯一之後援、本年七月衆院選舉時、完全失敗、今日因政府正式予以援助、故又稍抬頭、但仍不能儕於大黨之列、共産黨則按步就班向前進展、其目下所得之票數、竟能與社會民主黨相埓社民黨此次略失地盤、然不失爲第二大黨、其在投票總數内所占之數、未超過百分之二十、其力最要亦不可厚非、以擁護民主主義而論亦當首推此黨、惟其手段素來穏健、故大部份勞工、責其過於小心耳、本日最令人驚訝者、爲基督敎黨勢力之驟長是也、此派素以宗敎信仰爲基礎、其勢　代表中資階級之唯一政黨、對巴本内閣向取反對態度、此次之所以得勢、其故在是、毫無可疑、此次選舉扼要之點、仍爲新衆院中不能成立多數黨、故欲組織以議會爲後盾之内閣仍、仍不可能、由此點言之、則今日選舉之結果、又可視爲巴本内閣之勝利矣、巴本所持之唯一少數黨、（按指國權黨而言）此次所得之票、雖略有增加、而以之與全德選民人數比較、則爲數極微、然即如此而巴本仍不失爲戰勝者、</p>

<h3>孟買棉業週訊</h3>
<p>上週市况、初因日商竭力購買、頗形活潑、惟利物浦帮之套賣、亦能與之相抵、上印度出貨不多、目前巾價、難令賣戸脱手、但　印間差價旣狹、出口交易大受阻碍、而對日貿易、亦大受打撃、歐洲方面印棉需要甚微、收成情形、大致滿意、甘地虚及皮拉爾、傳有黑　病、惟發育進步、仍如去年、附錄上週統計如後（單位千包）</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市又甩三四角</h3>
<p>滬南　昨各帮來船計有五六十號、本街交易更覺呆滯蘇同帮及平望黎里盛澤等中關貨、瀉落四角光景、六穏白稻野稻亦跟跌二二角常溧北粳市無榮辱全日浦江斛開六七百石、</p>
<p>新閘　昨内地帮來船計有四十號左右、城郷店胃不佳崑山丹陽米開盤降短三角窰種客帮胃口全無、行情縮短二角洋杜尖及變隂元到銷二平形勢見鬆</p>
<h3>湖南秈昨有新到</h3>
<p>｜北帮辦胃尙活｜</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况本客鎖路均呆、統市未有交易、進戸以河下米價鬆落、亦有擯小再辦之意貨主心思甚堅、市面因此擯持未開、湖南米途貨已到埠、總計有二千包左右、惟福州帮胃口轉淡意存觀望北洋帮忽有去胃、乃繼閩帮到帀購買成交新到之湖南機油米七百五十六包、價九元三角至九元二角、又機元米一百零六包價十元零一角市價與前市相似、但以到過於銷、形勢巳不及上週之活潑云、</p>
<h3>粉價昨忽昻騰</h3>
<p>｜浮空抵補大廠收進｜</p>
<p>象以洋麥報價、祗好一角零、開盤時本月份反見軟弱惟十二月份則人心良好、開價提高一分、致以後各盤、開價步振、一時浮空抵補、頗見亟切、大廠聞爲維持粉價亦有收進、惟小廠則仍有脱售、業外客戸、因見市面廉宜收買亦不少、故各月份均見步俏、迨至下午開盤、大廠聞不論近遠、又有收進、故各月份市勢又爲抬住、較上午曾又好近分至以洋麥之定價而言、聞英美行家三兩四錢八分、可以打電日商祗三兩四錢半、雖謠傳洋麥將徵進口税、但事屬人事作用、與世界物價之低落、尙須分等觀之也、結果本月份較前週漲一分半、十二月份漲三分七厘半、一月份漲三分二厘半二月份二分二厘半三月份漲二分、四月份漲一分七釐半云</p>
<h3>期麥回好頗勁</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後各月份一致呈堅漲之象、以洋麥報價回好一角外市塲抛戸自然見寂且因大廠熊度不可捉摸投機客戸、遂見擯住而本年之籌碼實在不多如經少數抬住、卽易上騰傳廣帮欲做心思、各盤均有收進、致近遠期回漲頗速惟此種情形純係一時之供求關係前途尙不能以此依據也結果本月份不動、十二月份一二月較前週各漲四分、三月份漲五分四月份漲六分云、</p>
<h3>糖市荷糖又到四萬餘包</h3>
<p>昨糖市以走銷尙未大動、趨勢仍疲、公會劃盤二十四號捐砂白高貨ＲＡ嘜十四兩九錢半、普通貨初盤十四兩八錢七分半後爲八錢半、比前日小二分半、中砂白荷赤均平平如前、價乏上落、綿荷白前　之貨、全棉高貨十五兩半、後到身份半燥半霍者十五兩二錢、市尙堅穏、芝巴海輪昨日入口又到荷糖四萬餘包、計綿荷白一萬一千零四十包、粗砂白一萬一千一百三十五包靑糖一千九百七十五包、荷赤一萬六千三百六十六包、本廠綿白糖潮帮開出數十包、價十三兩七錢半、五福白泳大東　號稍有開出每砠價爲十兩零七錢、</p>
<h3>閘北貨篩莊桂元行盤轉跌</h3>

<h3>絲茶無錫宮繭續有運滬</h3>
<p>｜昨由滬錫貨車運到三百二十擔｜</p>
<p>氣　絲廠、自回復工作以來、生絲及絲繭下脚産額、日見加增、是以現絲等運滬、頗不寂莫、昨滬錫客貨車又有雙宮繭三百二十擔運滬、上棧待修云、</p>
<h3>洋莊茶市略淡</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、因西商賽馬、英莊行家祗有半日交易、市面頗形淸淡、全巾僅祇白頭莊瑞昌裕隆等地、及華茶公司、買進珍眉針眉娥眉貢熙暇目等貨、總計四百六十箱、市盤均無甚上落、惟據一般消息鹽通者稱、邇來摩洛哥市塲、茶銷巳逐漸發動、預料西商秋賽過後、市面或有活動之希望云、</p>
<h3>疋頭西裝花呢大批成交</h3>
<p>西裝套頭花呢、最近來洋服裁繼帮、大有進胃、因氣候漸寒、實銷仇需、門莊現定生意激增、尤以新盛行之漢令蓬Ｓportex四泡的克司ＧofteＸ考夫的克司Ｓprioghon司必　肯呢三種西裝套頭呢、修形旺銷、海上西服舖、咸有相當進胃、其趨勢較其了毛織品爲優云、</p>
<h3>煤炭山西煤續漲半兩</h3>
<p>昨市塲售開山西白煤、每噸漲五錢、計現售每噸非十五兩七錢半不可、紅崎白煤與馬克白煤、因而亦被帶上二錢五分云、</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語錄</p>
<h3>關於語錄的回響</h3>
<p>樂善堂最近收到從澳門寄來的一封信，内開：｜（相伯老先生座右。敬啓者，嘗於申報拜讀執事語錄，巳心儀其人；蓋閲歷旣深，世事洞明，人情練達，老成人固自不凡｜昨閲語錄中，有（惟有眞心萬古留）之句，尙街屬對。僕見獵心喜，自忘謭陋，屬成一打呈上，未審中有可取之句乎？想雕蟲小技，不合亦無傷大雅；望有以正之，是所欣幸焉｜恭請</p>
<p>頣安！僕林安登上。</p>
<p>錄出四句：一，允宜孝行千秋仰：二，焉能大道須臾離：三，莫貽失足千秋恨；四，母忘善念霎時現，其餘從删相老人閲此信後説：（最好集王了一遺文，原有字句來對。曾試集成一句（誰悲浮景總歸盡）對那（惟有眞心萬古留）。何妨錄出原文，讓大衆來推敲｜）</p>
<p>這麽一來，我祇好費半天工夫，臨寫于右任先生的字，抄給大衆，共同欣賞，且待下一次公表｜</p>
<h3>内戰的頌詞啟沃</h3>
<p>爲的顧全東亞的安謐，爲的維持世界的和平，中國軍人寗肯容忍着一腔氣忿，自家兒火迸，絶不肯輕啓國際的戰端：雖失地萬里，亦所不惜。這種（摩頂放踵）的態度，這等酷愛和平的苦心，也只有中國軍人才有，也只有中國軍人才做得到，諾貝爾和平奬金得主，其在中華乎！其在中華乎！</p>
<p>閙過災，閙過匪，老百姓弄得鳩形鵠面，似人非人，似鬼非鬼，這種人旣找不着事做，又病　　地餓不死，活在世上反正没有用，倒不如一砲給他掃個乾凈。戰塲有的是野狗，省得買棺材，這又節省了一筆費用；而且照優生學講，這般下層人物當然不像要人一樣應該盡量繁殖，這於民族體質有關，早不除根，必遺後悔。</p>
<p>内戰的高尙意義，如是如是！</p>
<h3>慈谿北鄕之高抬擱會</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>｜娱樂不忘救國？</p>
<p>當然·北平舉辦時輪金剛法會，爲祈禱國家和平；那末，鄕下地方｜茲谿北鄕山北｜舉行高抬擱會，也是祈禱國家和平的一種方法了。慈谿北鄕山北地方，濱海背山，民俗强悍，從淸初以來，每年隂歷三月，本有迎神賽會這種事情。或説：明旣被滅於滿淸，遺民非常痛恨，借着賽會的事，暗寓革命之意。所迎的神，雖説是東嶽大帝，實是明之懷宗；所以三月賽會，便是紀念懷宗殉國的日子。｜浙東風俗，淸明家家挿柳枝，也是招魂的意思。又謝年的時候，供着（南朝一切聖衆）紙馬。甬人好唪太陽經，虔信朱天菩薩。都是反淸復明的好證據。｜雖然放翁詩道：一到家更約西鄰女，明日河橋看賽神。）賽會之事，宋代已經盛行，我們浙東的賽會，可是别有意義啊。</p>
<p>這次慈北高抬擱會，已有二十九年没有舉行了。會也没有什麽稀罕，旂纛儀仗，和江灣等會，没甚特色，不過抬擱高到三丈三尺，用七十二人舁行，|二十四人一組，互換舁抬，|臺上並不用童男女扮裝戲劇人物，是用成人串扮的。據説：每座抬擱，費洋多至萬金，全會分十四社，每社會是每堡人所出的，共有抬擱十四座，所費巳經很可觀了。而且抬擱所過的地方，雖然不是逢山開山，遇河搭橋，而遇到了屋簷樓臺等障礙物，都要拆毁，没得違抗。路呢，各堡人民，都應自己臨時建築，廣約二丈左右，塡得很爲平坦。我想：山北的賽會，何以獨有高抬擱，也許别有歷史吧。山北有一個小城，呌做（觀海衛），是明時防倭寇造的，因爲地瀕大海，那時倭寇常來擾害，這高抬擱也許是作瞭望倭寇之用，賽會又是民衆練習武備了。否則别處賽會，儘管有抬擱，何以没有三丈三尺高呢。</p>
<p>本月五·六·七·三日，慈北是舉行高抬擱會了，人山人海，必有一番熱鬧！要是看會賽會的朋友們，都記得抵抗倭寇的故事，寓兵於農，習練武事，那纔配説（娛樂不忘救國了）。|這次賽會，縣官本來禁止，後來由大力者抱腰，縣裏乃派兵去保護，聞第一社名喚（中山會，）當然舁的神，是中山先生了</p>
<p>。</p>
<h3>矛盾</h3>
<p>— 沃</p>

<p>Ｘ　X　X</p>
<p>（長期抵抗），（討伐僞組織）的口號都聽得厭了，然而關外還不見有我們的武裝同志）的踪跡；奔馳於黑山白水間的，還是那此受大人先生們口頭援助的單衣禦敵的義勇軍</p>
<h3>人老珠黄不値錢</h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>|靑年人應當怎樣？|</p>
<p>人生最快樂的黄金時代，是在十歲以前吧！不過我應預先聲明，現在所記的，是和我同一個階段的人們；其他具有（超）或（特）的人，當然不在此例。</p>

<p>三、遺棄了一個落伍者</p>
<p>革命不忘戀愛呢？變愛不忘革命呢？還是革命和戀愛都要呢？腦筋簡單的韓大少爺慕良，已記不淸楚了。總之，自從他到了首都以後，眼見玄武湖裏，秦淮河邊，淸涼山上，雨花台畔，和其他一切可以登臨游眺的地方，總是一個男子和一個女子很親熱的有談有笑的一起來往着，坐立着。一個烫頭髮，跳舞襪的女子，倚在軍裝帶，軟皮鞭的男子身邊，便覺得革命的空氣，充滿了戀愛，戀愛的潮流，捲起了革命。</p>
<p>更使他不能由　生妬，由妬生恨的，是每度的宴會了。</p>
<p>記得，到ＸＸ部任職的第八天，許多同事，在安樂酒家接風，一間屋子，擺了兩席酒，男的女的夾雜坐着，玉笑珠香，把乾燥的恭維，巴結，數衍，誇大，炫耀，欣羡，種種不同的（吹）（拍）方式，調劑得和諧了。馮科長的夫人，講故都的小考而夫球，用淸脆的京話説着，比聽梅蘭芳唱的戲，還要悦耳，李科長的夫人，喜歡賭的，上海的跑狗，最有心得，眞正的上海白，也不討厭。最引起闔座注意的，是科員常珊芬女同志的跳舞絡，却爾司登咧，華爾次咧，用伊帶着四粒頭鑽戒的纎手，代替穿高跟鞋的玉趾，在圓桌面邊上模擬出步式來，還要把頭一側一側的動着，嘴裏輕輕的哼着進行曲，連安定着的人造象牙筷，幾乎也要軒軒欲舞了。</p>
<p>到底男子們是平淡而粗魯的，只能讚美璇宮艶史的偉大，胡蝶兩個酒渦的有詩意，麥賽而的西菜，不及樂郷飯店的好，南京的旗袍太短了，蘇州太冷靜了，這些話，幾乎廳得騷韃子快從耳管裏跳出來了。不要去聽他們罷，還是賞鑑女子們的容顔和粉飾罷，這一個額際幾根頭髮梢，怪有味兒，那一個嘴唇上的臙脂，塗得太濃了，連菜都不敢多吃了。倒不如那邊桌子上一個只畫細眉毛，抺巴黎乾粉，不（點絳唇）的來得大方，自然。</p>

<h3>上南變更區域問題</h3>

<h3>中外商輪停航東北</h3>
<p>貨物缺乏營業衰落</p>
<p>封鎖後無貨可裝　　安東營　　口、自經僞國宣布、於九月二十五日、實收關税及噸鈔以來、凡中國貨件、運至該處者、須値百抽三、强迫納進口税、而由該埠裝來之雜糧荳油等項、亦須繳出口税、我國宣布封鎖東北各海關後、滬上客帮、即一致停辦貨物、又以金融不能流通、致貿易無形阻斷、加以南華各埠所用油荳等項、紛紛改由長江及海州等處購辦、成本較輕、且避兩重課税、故安東上海間之貨運、因亦中斷矣、</p>
<p>英商輪减班改航　　九一八事發生以來、上海在東北航行之船、逐漸减少、華商毓大輪局、已被僞國監視、肇興海昌等船、亦各减少班次、祇裝煤斤、惟英商太古公司、在安東上海、派有專航輪船、上次自行駛該路舟山號觸礁沉失後、曾改派成都輪代航、刻因安滬間來去、均無貨儎、空放須納噸鈔、遂將該輪改行南華航綫、</p>
<h3>日商日淸公司謀復長江班輪</h3>
<p>免收水脚竭力招攬</p>
<p>但結果乘客仍寥寥</p>
<p>新聲社云、日商日淸汽船會社、自九一八事件發生後、受我國民衆之抵制、營業大受影響、自一二八事起、將長江班各輪停航、迄今雖經再三設法恢復、用盡心計、毫無效果、</p>
<p>被抵停駛　　該社總社在日本、上海爲分社、營業以長江班爲主、計洛陽·鳳陽·南陽·岳陽·瑞陽·襄陽·大貞·大福·大利·等九艘、專行駛長江上下游、北洋班華山·唐山·等二艘南洋班廬山·嵩山·等二艘、受我國民衆之抵制、於一二八事起、將長江班各輪完全停駛、南洋班北洋班設法勉强維持通航、但每次損失甚巨、旋將長江班鳳陽南陽襄陽等三艘恢復行駛、其餘各輪、停泊於黄浦江及長江沿途各碼頭、</p>
<p>設計無效　　自停航後、長江班各輪海員、因此失業、爲愛國起見、情願犧牲、現長江班南陽丸等三艘雖巳復航、但每次開駛、華人旅客及客貨寥寥、僅日本來華之轉口日貨、每行駛一次、虧本甚巨、所有中艙工友、不得已均臨時調班工作、雖經總社長來華再三設計恢復、如水脚跌價、武裝保護、物别宣傳、不惜犧牲、準備於八月一日完全恢復、詎届時仍因我國民氣激昻、以致無法實行、</p>
<p>免收水脚　新聲社記者、昨聞航業界探知日淸公司用盡苦計、無日不在籌議設法恢復營業、最近新計畫、現巳實行、公司免收水脚、向來水脚即運脚客脚、由買辦承包、由買辦酌收船票、（即客脚）及運費、（即運脚）爲船上開支、例如船票上海至漢口、六元五角、現視旅客酌收二元三元四元不等、俟稍有起色、即將洛陽岳陽瑞陽等三艘、先行恢復、而貧苦之華人旅客、雖樂於搭載、但每次開駛、總仍寥寥、客貨仍僅日本各轉口日貨、故事實上恢復行駛、仍難實現、</p>

<h3>件費唐法官研究上海公共租界情形報告書第四卷（十六）</h3>
<p>第四章　董事之資格及閘於董事操行與任期之條例</p>
<p>一（地産章程所載關於董事資格之規定、係僅就董事之經濟資格而言、即凡對於市府收入輸助若干欵額者、有被學爲董事之資格、前已述及、註一）、按照地産章程第十九欵之規定董事之資格比投票人爲高、無論何人（非除執照費外、每年繳納工部局估定房地捐滿五十兩、或其貨住之房屋、每年付給工部局估定之租價滿一千　百兩者）不合被舉充任　寧之資格、</p>
<p>二、市組織法内、通常有一種明白規定、使在某種情况之下、不得被舉爲議董或不能保留其爲議董之地位、此種剥奪資格之規定普通包括下列各欵、</p>
<p>（一）充任市議會之任何職員、或在市議會之下、處於任何侔利之地位者不合被舉爲謠董或充任議董之資格、</p>
<p>（二）謹董未經請假、不出席市議會會議至若干時期者應卽開缺、</p>
<p>（三）除某某例外之事件外、倘一議董與市議會所訂合同有經濟關係、該議董應卽迴避、</p>
<p>（四）犯有重罪經定　者、經該管法院宣告爲神經不健全者或經宣告破産而債務尙未淸償者均無被舉爲董事或保留其董事地位之資格、</p>
<p>三爲舉證例起見茲將天津英租界地産章程所載關於上文（一）（三）（四）三項之規定引述如左第十四條（一）無論第十三條之規定爲何若、凡有左列情形之一者、無被舉爲董事及充任董事之資格、</p>
<p>（甲）市審計師、或在董事會所有授與權或處分權之下、充任任何職員或處於任何　利之地位者、</p>
<p>（乙）本人或其合夥者、對於董事會或代表董事所訂任何同或爲董事所承辦之任何事務直接或間接有股份或關係者、</p>
<p>（二）但無論何人、倘僅因其對於下列事項爲有股份或關係、則不應取消其被舉爲董事及充任董事之資格、或視爲與此種合同或承辦事務爲有股份或關係、</p>
<p>（甲）任何租地售地或購地、或租地售購地之任何合同、</p>
<p>（乙）借欵之任何合同、或僅爲付欵之任何擔保、　　（丙）公衆投標所訂合同、其應接受與否、有關係之董事未嘗參與表决者、</p>
<p>（丁）刊豋關於市府事務任何廣告之任何新聞紙、或、</p>
<p>（戊）任何有限責任公司與董事會所訂關於在市區内供給電光水料或任何其他事件之合同、三）任何董事倘被控告犯有可以起訴之罪、或受破産之審查者不得繼續其董事之職務、</p>
<p>四·除關於此項問題之任何明白規定外鄙人深信、上文所述關於董事資格及董事操行之各種限制、在已往之時、大部份業經公共租轼是内之明達社會、認爲合乎情理、且屬需要、故曾爲有關係人士所遵守、但鑒於業經提出之建議（註二）卽　㈠增加董事人數、㈡展延董事任期爲兩年、鄙人以爲、修改地産章程時、宜將關於此項事件之明白規定、包括在内、此項規定之究應如何措詞、鄙人固不欲在此詳細論述、但可將某數點、簡單討論、</p>
<p>五·工部局職員之不得充任董事、雖未經地産章程明文規定、但鄙人深信、此種限制、在已往之時經認爲事屬必要且謂目前之工部局、當不准許任何職員、出爲董事之候選人、或不許任用任何董事充當董事會控制下之任何職務、而一面復任其保持董事之席位、此固可安然假定、而無欵義者、但爲保障將來起見、似宣有明白規定、董事與工部局職員間之區别、如不嚴格維持、而工部局之各級職員、又經認爲可以被舉充任董事則工部局之性質以及公共租界之全部治制、顯將不久完全改變、惟就現有情况而論、此種改變、或可無庸改變地産章程之文字、而即實現、</p>
<p>所須注意者、工部局之外籍職員、按照其服務條例之規一、經准免納房捐及其他市税、故若　現均不能取得投票人或董事所必需之資格、</p>
<p>六、至於董事因不出席會議而開缺、修正之董事會規則第四十七欵載有規定如左、</p>
<p>爲社會之福利起見、茲經建議、任何董事、倘須離滬三個月、或三個月上、應將其辭職書遞交總董聽其處分、庶在董事會决定將遺缺選人袖充時、得行選補、依照地産章程第二十條之規定、現任董事出缺、（倘所出不過三缺、得由在職之董事、多敎投票選補、）</p>
<p>設使董事任期、經由一年而展長爲兩年、則關於董事　常不出席會議而出缺、或因離滬、患病、以及其他原因、而不能參加會議而出缺、其須訂立一種規定、顯然更見重要、</p>
<p>七、關於董事對於工部局所訂合同有經濟關係之規定、其性質何若、此所經討論之各項問題、尤感困難、但此項問題、在將來董事人數增加以後、對於工部局所有能力藉以維持其財政廉潔之高尙程度、向爲該局之行政特色者、又有影響、故該項問題殊爲重要、</p>
<p>八、工部局之辦事規則、載有左列各項規定、以限制董事會董事及委員會委員、對於與其自身有經濟關係事項之發言權、或投票權、</p>
<p>（第三四條　任何董事、對於預定提出討論之事項、有經濟關係者、應聲明有此種關係、倘經總董請其勿發言、或勿投票、或於開會時退席、均應照辦、）</p>
<p>（第七七條　任何委員、對於預定提出討論之事項、有經濟關係者、應聲明有此種關係、倘經其他各委員請其勿發言、或勿投票、或於開會時退席、均應照辦、）</p>
<p>九、上述兩項規則、雖係以承認一種原則爲基礎、即董事或委員、倘與提出討論之任何問題有私人經濟關係、卽應使其對於該項問題、不得投票、或設法影響其同僚對於該項問題之投票、但此項規定之程式、有可指摘之處、緣不將有關係董事或委員之發言或投票、予以無條件禁止、而將應否禁止之問題、一則交由總董、一則交由有關係之委員會委員、斟酌决定乃使總董或委員會之所决定者、時或令人窘迫不安、且易招人怨妬、鄙人以爲、較妥之辦法、在於訂立一種確定之標例、使董事或委員、對於其自身有經濟關係之任何問題、不得參加討論或投票、或甚至可令於該項問題經提出辯論、或付表决時、退在會議室、唯如該董事或委員所有關係、爲與大部份之民衆所共有者、或可作爲例外、尙有可注意者一層、卽　現有規定之方式、似僅指董事或委員會所有個人經濟關係、至於僱用該董事或委員之商行或公司所有經濟關係、並未經明白包括在内、</p>
<p>在本報告書之某附錄内、（註三）、鄙人曾將杜蘭斯窪爾市政法規所載、關於此項問題之更爲確定槪括之規定引述、以資例證、</p>
<p>一十、除限制董事或委員、使對於與其有經濟關係之任何問題、不得發言或投票之問題外、尙有一種問題、卽　董事或委員、除種有限之例外外、是否應與工部局所訂任何合同不得有何關係、考量此項問題、一方面須計及切實保障公衆之利益、使董事或委員、不致圖謀利用其地位、以增進其私人利益、一方面須計及不可訂立無謂之限制致使負責之商人、因此種限制之損及其個人營業、或其所代表之商行或公司之營業而不敢充任董事、嚴格之限制、每使才可勝任董事之商人、失其充當董事資格乃有減弱董事會人材之危險、且市府所訂合同、其與董事自身、或其所代表之商行、有經濟關係者、果能保證公布、當不至有董事不正當利用其地位之嚴重危險、此固爲業在他處所予承認者、</p>
<p>一一、由是觀之、僅有兩　以供採擇、卽　（一）除某種有限之例外外、一律禁产止董事與工部局訂立合同、或與工部局所訂合同有關係、（二）訂立一種規定務使（甲）與工部局所訂合同、凡與董事有關係者、應將此項關係正式公布、俾衆周知、（乙）有閘係之董事自身、對於此項合同有關係之問題、不得參加討論或投票、</p>
<p>在本報告書之某附錄内、（注四）、鄙人曾引述杜蘭斯窪爾市政法規所載、足爲關於此項問題而有兩種更替辦法例證之規定、</p>
<p>（註一）參閲本報告書第五編第六韋三十節、</p>
<p>（註二）參閲本報告書第五編第六章（已）所　之改革計畫（三）及（六）、</p>
<p>（註三）參閲附錄四十三、一九二六年地方政府法令第四十一條</p>
<p>（註四）參閲附錄四十三、一九二六年地方政府法令第三十九條及第四十條、並參閲該法令第三十八條及第四十二條、該兩條法令對於市議董之競爭任何專門職業士奬賞、無論爲贊助　家會、或反對市議會者、均予禁止、並不准市　董以當事人資格出席於市議會所設立之佔價法庭或市　會所組織之執照委員會（未完）</p>

<h3>念經修廟與敎育</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>近來社會上情眞有點「反常，」大槪是生物學家所謂「隠性復現」。與心理學家所謂「返本遺傳」吧。？否則何以我們處處覺得踏着過去的足跡呢？</p>
<p>不信，請看北平在念經，而今仙人不世出。，海佛倒還有。，不可謂非幸事。此次金剛法會，據報載各方至贈三萬五萬的合計起來，消耗不下二三十萬金，猗歟盛哉。｜足使小和尙聞之昨舌。。近比梁武帝。，遠溯到封神榜時代。，大槪也相差不遠吧。｜惜乎未能咒死木屐兒。，大是憾事。。大槪對方也有神道。，神神相遇。，如物理學上之正負對立。，效力因以抵銷。。　　近法會功德剛圓滿，而修廟又將動工，前日報載南京電，修建孔廟費三十萬，國府再催財部籌撥，可見國家尙武而又崇文之心。，眞是雙方顧到。。獨財部有部無財。，小民無財有命。。平津敎費。，久欠未發。，而蘭州小學敎員。，又因經費無着而罷敎。。｜見報載本月二日西安電｜何幸而爲死人。？何不幸而爲活人。。　　孔廟因與我國古代文化有關，且其建築也値得保存，我雖非聖人之徒，也不持反對理由，然而此乃國家承平之時，國庫充裕後的工作，不足以語於現在，孔子當年譏管氏「三歸」。，魯「刻桷」。，而今其亦未能免乎。？誦「未能事人。，焉能事鬼」之語。，不禁三嘆。。　　或説造廟念經，並不是爲死去的人。，是爲。活着的人。，那末。，我無間言。。</p>

<h3>讀調查團報告書有感二首</h3>
<p>— 易炳初</p>
<p>象胥驚成帙，讀罷涙暗埀，有土人皆羡，無才衆共欺，胡兒横朔漠，悍將弄潢池，燮理偏忘迹，私心何所期，</p>

<h3>一般人對於生物的誤解（續）</h3>
<p>— 曉光</p>
<p>㈥蝙蝠是老鼠變的</p>
<p>蝙蝠和老鼠，頭的形狀頗相似，並且兩者都寄居在人家幽僻的處所，在夜間出外覓食，因此有些人説蝙蝠是老鼠變的。這是一種（類似推想）的錯誤，在動物學上蝙蝠屬於哺乳動物的翼手類｜並非屬於鳥類｜老屬於齧齒類，蝙蝠肢尾間滿張薄膜，能飛翔，以昆虫爲食料，牠的習性和老鼠全不相同。</p>
<p>㈦蟹無血</p>
<p>有的地方土話説（没有），常以（蟹血）爲代用詞。不過不是紅色罷了。牠的心臟係一心耳與一心室合成，司循環作用。呼吸用鰓，取水中養氣以清血液。又抱朴子云：（山中稱無腸公子者，蟹也）；俗語説蟹爲（七脚八手無肚腸），亦屬誤解。</p>
<p>㈧犀角能照妖分水</p>
<p>犀角能照妖的傳説，大槪起源於晋書：「溫嶠至牛渚磯，水深不可測，世云其下多怪物。嶠遂燃犀角而照之。須臾，見水族覆火，奇形怪狀。這是無稽之談，犀爲一種食草獸，較象略小，皮虜無毛，極堅厚，古人用以製甲。産於西藏印度者，鼻上生一角，呌做一角犀：産於非洲者，鼻上前後生二角，呌做二角犀。角質堅緻，可以製器或入藥。這兩種犀均喜游泳，角露水上，凌波而進，故見者誤信犀角能分水。</p>
<p>㈨鬼呌</p>
<p>人死後有靈魂，這差不多是世界上各種民族的共通觀念。據説靈魂有知覺，能行動，當然也會説話，於是鬼呌」的迷信就附會出來了！李華弔古戰塲文：「常覆三軍，往往鬼哭，天隂則聞」。杜甫兵車行：「新鬼煩寃故鬼哭，天隂雨濕聲啾啾」。言之鑿鑿，好像眞有其事。但是聲的成因，起於物體的振動，人死則軀體配腐，精神作用亦隨之而消滅，那裏會有靈魂？那裏會有鬼呌？王充論衡訂鬼篇：「凡天地之間有鬼，非人死精神爲之也，皆人思念存想之所致也。致之何由？由於疾病。人病則憂懼，憂懼是鬼出」。這話很對｜所謂鬼呌實在是一種夜鳥｜俗名項鳥｜的鳴聲。隨園詩話中記着王葑亭的詩句：「怪禽聲類鬼，暗樹影欵人」。這可説是先得我心了。</p>
<p>㈩黄瓜和落花生不可同吃</p>
<p>胡瓜俗稱黄瓜，漢張騫使西域得其種，故名。落花生又名長生果，夏秋之交開花，色黄如蝶形，花後子房入地下，結實成莢，故名落花生。相傳這兩種果實不可同吃，吃足以傷命。有人曾經分析牠們的成分，無論怎樣化合，都檢不出絲毫毒質：並且將牠們同吃，經過了長久的時間，也没有不良的影響。</p>

<h3>答「廢除鬧新房的惡習」的非議</h3>
<p>— 曉雪</p>
<p>「人是感情的興奮的動物，至少有一部分眞理，因其如此······人間的節縟繁文愈甚·」文炳君劈頭便伸説社會進化的要素·可是社會之所以進化，人類之所以文明，感情外應加以理智的考慮·眞的，憑感情及一時興奮所作的行動，往往是錯的，唯有理智纔能判斷事情的善惡：若是一種興奮感情之行爲不加以理智考慮的，或者可以説惡的，因其對社社的進化有防碍，那麽有一種習慣，承着傳統而不加以理智來思考，或可名之曰惡習，於是鬧新房不能例外，　　鬧新房的發始者，（一種推測，因其不可查考故）或許曾加以考慮，但是漸漸地傳統下直到現今，一種考慮，早已湮没無聞：所以致於有野蠻之舉動以因無考慮之故·若試問剛鬧過新房的人：「老Ｘ，你做啥鬧新房？」他必瞠目以對，或者説：「鬧新房是開開懷，單喝酒氣悶，阿懂？」這種現象，普遍着羣衆的心理，就是智識階級也如此，</p>
<p>惟其已失去鬧新房的眞義，惟其現代人已没有理智的考慮，也惟其憑情感作用，憑興奮的作用，所以本席有廢除的提議·</p>
<p>從上面幾段理論可證明是社會的惡習·而文君説我「故作危辭」未免過於武斷，而未加以考慮吧？！又文君説甲乙丙的例子，「恐」是虚構，這須加以辯正的，我當時作此文時，極力想縮短篇幅，因此事實之陳述過於簡單，致文君疑之「恐」是虚構，這件事實是我從已婚與未婚的靑年學生中探討得，他們的心理都作如是觀，而且還形諸事實，文君没有見過，而本人探討過也見過·</p>
<p>新郎與賀客衝突文君以爲「也許」（偶然）有之，若文君矚目四顧，向全中國一看，就知不是「也許」「偶然」了！而是常常有之了！</p>
<p>文君若不　鬧新房是惡習，請參考新聞報茶話欄中江西人的把戲，小一點説，上海及其附近的把戲，大一點説看看全中國社會中的把戲！</p>
<p>文君坐在上海徒喊「提倡」，可是徒增了中國社會的罪惡！</p>
<p>惡習</p>
<h3>十月朝的會</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>鏜，鏜，鏜，的鑼聲，强有力的剌進了我的耳鼓·接着又是一陣嘈雜聲和一片鳴鳴叭叭的樂器聲，自遠而近，悠揚動聽，啊！誰家又在迎娶新娘娘了，我心中狐疑地猜着。</p>
<p>踏出門外一看，黑壓壓的，街坊上早巳擁擠着不少的人，紅男綠女，紛至沓來，今天這樣的熱鬧，早巳猛烈地衝破了，冷靜得鬼也捉得出的十八世紀風味的Ａ鎭上的寂寞的空氣。</p>
<p>經過了一陣人聲鼎沸，鼓樂喧天，就見一面面的，紅緞綠邊，繡着一爪金龍的三角旗，飄揚飛舞，浩浩蕩蕩而來，後面還緊跟着，一對對的，白地黑字，紅底金字的馬牌，和刀槍劍戟，十八般武器的鑾架，這種充滿着封建色彩的，落伍，時代廢物，一椿椿，一件件，如梭般的，經過得川流不息，啊！我猜錯了，不是人家迎娶，又是在舉行甚麽迎神賽會的把戲了，於是不禁深深地嘆了一口氣，唉！内憂外侮，國將不國，正當的，急迫的，救國運動，不去做，還在熙熙攘攘的，踴躍地，幹這種無智識的，勞民傷財的，修干例禁的，迎神賽會的迷信舉動，眞是醉生夢死了，但，我末這樣觸景生情的，悲喪，嘆息，而萬頭鑽動中，充滿着一片贊成的，歡迎的空氣，燃香啊，點燭啊，膜拜啊，各個人，都笑嘻嘻的，熱烈地，歡騰着，兩旁店舖中人，也都裂開了嘴，東指西盡地，興緻淋漓的，高談闊論：</p>
<p>「洽哈，天罡旗來哉，我記得天罡旗，一共有三十六面，打頭一面，是剌殺閻婆媳的，梁山好漢，宋公明阿！」</p>
<p>「老孫｜你瞧，「蕭靜」，「逃遁」，兩塊馬牌來了，南貨店裏的小夥計，向着一個姓孫的同事説。</p>
<p>哼！不要臉，識白辽的總司令，這兩塊馬牌，一塊呌，「肅靜」，一塊呌「迴避」，你讀做「蕭靜逃遁」，看來你的字，是孔夫子的太婆敎你的」姓孫的夥計，説畢，揚揚得意，旁邊的小夥計，羞得面紅耳赤。</p>
<p>「看囉，看囉，皇命來了，啊唷唷，這位老爺，眞威風了，皇命有八個哩，怪不得有這樣靈騐啊！一般妖精妖怪，見了他這八個皇命，馬上要發拌，所以人家生了病，求了這位老爺，馬上就好，原來他皇命多的緣故，」這充滿着封建意義的，不倫不類的，迷信的話，是一個商人模樣的男子説的。</p>
<p>「啊唷！好看煞了，還有託香參加呢，哈哈哈，·····」拍手狂笑的歡呼聲中，出現了十多個，勇糾糾，氣昻昻，精神百倍的，鄕下靑年，個個赤着臂膊，臂上都剌着不少的鐵絲鈎子，繋了一根紅頭繩，下面埀着石獅子，花盆，一類的東西，這名呌託香，唉！勇武啊，好好的肉上，剌了鐵鈎，掛上三四十斤的東西，可惜這種苦肉的犧牲精神，不去爲國效勞，徒然做這種迷信的舉動。　　「老爺到了，快放高升迎接，」砰卜，砰卜，劈拍，劈拍，一陣高升鞭砲，就見許多人，簇擁着一座木偶，到來，對門射角的，商店老闆，個個恭恭敬敬地，跪上去，叩頭像搗蒜，又都燃香，焚元寳，忙個不亦樂乎。</p>
<p>鐺，鐺，鐺，鑼聲響處，一羣無知的善男信女，又把木偶，簇擁到别處去了。我觀畢入内，母親問我，「士兒，今天十月朝的會，好看嗎？」</p>
<p>笑話</p>
<h3>雨傘和便壼</h3>
<p>— 迓施</p>
<p>我們鄕裏有一個紳士，很甚有錢，人家恭維他都呼做土財翁，只是未曾讀過書，所有人家借了他的銀錢用物等，他總是在賬簿上畫些形像作爲記賬，或是借出幾十元洋錢，便在賬簿上畫幾十個圓圈洋錢形，借出幾只碗，便畫幾個碗形，</p>
<p>他確有個親家，是一位　門秀士，家裏頗貧，有一回來到他家，他外出，未得晤面，就一人沉坐，忽然在桌上看</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>見了他那一本銀錢進出賬，即無聊地用手翻開看了看，噫，怎麽這樣一本好賬簿，弄得這樣污糟難看，如是便問他家的僕人，這是做什麽用的，僕人説，那是我主人的賬簿，所有銀錢借出，貨物買進，都在這賬簿上寫着的，這位秀士聽了這詁，即向空長嘆了一口氣，唉，他這樣一個目不識丁的人，偏是發財，我雖不才，也算是一個黌門秀子，原何如此貧窘呢，慨然發嘆，曰，亦是「命也，就提起筆管信手在賬簿上寫了個「命也」二字，即辭而去，</p>
<p>後這位目不識丁的財主回來了，見了賬簿上有了這個形跡，即問僕人，我不在家有什麽人來了的，僕人答道，是某某親家來過的，他當時聽到這話，將賬簿向檯上一擲，氣忿忿的道，説不和這些窮鬼往來的，一跑來就借一把雨傘找個便壼，哈哈，他把個「命」字當是畫的一把雨傘，「也」字當是畫的一只便壼，形勢像再有些像，未免令人噴飯，</p>

<h3>備而不用</h3>
<p>— 祖來</p>
<p>賬房王先生提議説，世風日下盜賊不分晝夜，像我們一天到晚銀洋進出實在眞正危險，故我想裝只警鈴備而不用各友以爲如何，夥友們聽了王先生的話，都異口同聲説（對），并且還贊美他辦事周到·</p>
<p>三日後·XX莊大門上發現一只四方紅玻璃燈，玻璃上還寫着二個字「報警·」</p>
<p>不料事有凑巧，不到一星期强盜果然臨門了，一個把守大門，一個把守後門，另四個各持手槍衝進櫃檯内，「識相些」一個强盜很兇猛的説，</p>
<p>各夥友們見四枝手槍都駭得魂飛天外，不是凳底下鑽，便是檯底下蟠，把警鈴二個字早已忘得烟消雲散了，强盜毫不客氣的將桌上三千元鈔票四百元現洋拿了堂而皇之的去了·</p>
<p>夥友們見强盜已去，漫漫的從凳底下或檯底下扒出來，但都是面無人色呆若木雞般的了，久之便開始爭論了，「你爲什麽不撳警鈴？」「撳了警鈴你性命要不要「」見了手槍魂也没有了那裏還想得着撳警鈴「」嗄性命險啊」號稱滑稽大王的李先生挿口説，這就呌「備而不用」</p>

<h3>夜襲</h3>
<p>— 善</p>
<p>義勇軍光復藩陽城的意象畫　　時間的巨輪，已將我們帶入了秋的領域。這夜，正是一個凉爽的愉快的美麗的秋之夜。一條城西的大街上，靜悄悄地，行人早已閉了門躱在他們的屋子裏守候着，祈禱着平安的明日來臨：只有街沿一株株的老樹，兀立着浴在慘澹的電光下和毛雨徽風之中，枝葉振動，送出颯颯之音。遠處小巷裏，一聲聲的犬吠聲，不時傳來，偶然驚破了這夜之沉寂。</p>
<p>忽然間，一個漆黑的摸糊的人影兒，手裏執着一根像桿兒樣的東西，從街之盡頭匍匐着像蛇一樣，探手探脚地向前進來，忽隠忽現，爬到老樹的背後，把身子藏住子；不一會，同樣地又閃出一個影子。接着一個。又是一個！頃刻，每一株老樹的後面，都有一個持桿兒的雄偉的影子在幌動着。</p>
<p>午夜時分了。毛雨漸漸的急驟，狂暴：風，牠亦盡能的呼吼，怒號！只有電光，仍然保持着牠的慘澹，隂緣········</p>
<p>「轟｜｜」城門外天崩地塌似的一聲；五百個義勇軍齊聲呐喊，槍口緊對着城門衝來｜火把高擎着，染紅了半邊天。老樹背後的影子，一個個全跳出街心，抽出火把，一齊撥動桿兒上的機紐。「怦｜怦｜怦｜｜」一個首先搶上城牆砍倒了守衛的敵兵：迅速地把城門開放，五百個活虎般的壯士，像潮水湧了進來｜</p>
<p>敵人正在做着美妙的酣夢。驚醒了，趕忙下急集合令。一部份的敵人已開始發動了。</p>
<p>「殺｜殺呀｜」····「怦！）···」轟！）····恐怖之幕已顯然揭開了！映在人的眼前的是｜火把！血光！人頭！伏屍！······</p>
<p>「殺！殺啊！中華的男兒呀！時候到了！就在今夜和敵人總算血帳！一個也不要放過他！拿我們中華民族的血來淹死敵人！····殺！殺呀！｜」</p>
<p>敵人的陣線粉碎了！義勇軍的鐵騎佈滿了城之四廂！</p>

<h3>好萊塢的經濟復蘇桀克</h3>
<p>全世界的經濟恐慌也使好萊塢受着嚴重的打撃。好萊塢有一萬四千個臨時演員。飢寒交迫的失業了兩年之久。現在因西席地密爾創作ＴheＳignoftheＣross偉大歷史新片。已有三分之的人數。重新得吃牛乳和三明治。今日的好萊塢。又是生氣蓬勃。同從前黄金時代相彷佛了。每天午後五時三十分。好萊塢的會計處窗洞口。成百成千羅馬衣裝的男女演員在領薪金。在蔭道上。有古裝耶蘇敎徒。有穿豹皮衣裳的奴隸。有羅馬裝的男女。同羣衆混雜着。地密爾的天材解决了好萊塢的失業問題了。</p>
<p>今年正月裏。地密爾要導演ＴheＳignoftheＣross新片的消息。一經傳出。他立刻給演員包圍了。地密爾每天足足要費十八小時的工夫。去聽鈴聲不絶的電話和看雪片飛來的函件。他的辦公室前面。竚候着密密層層的男女。在呌喊着。「地密爾先生。看上帝的面子。用了我罷。我好幾月没事幹了。我的妻子專靠救濟會養活。我的兒子又生病了。可憐可憐我罷」。</p>
<p>「這多麽傷心呀」。地密爾帶笑的説。「我到那裏他們便跟到那裏。要挑選幾個拒絶幾個。眞是一件傷心的工作。爲着一幕。我們要從兩百多人裏面。挑選五十人。一看那些落選的人的面孔。啊。多麽難受呀」。</p>
<p>地密爾的新片中。僱用的大小演員。有的只做幾天。有幾個在全片裏都做。一幕裏有一羣穌敎徒。秘密的在羅馬城邊墓旁祈禱。羅馬守兵的辭箭紛紛射來。射死了許多。許多演員。哀憫的懇求。不要把他們扮做射死的。因爲一經射死。他們就不能再用在片子裏了。</p>
<p>好萊塢登記的演員一萬四千人。在兩年以前多能從拍影戲過活。從前每一部影戲。一定要有熱鬧的一幕。否則觀衆就不滿意。地密爾在「十誡」影片裏。有一幕用過三千人。「賓漢」等片演成。却撮合了幾百個演員。結婚生子。並且給他們溫飽了好幾年。現在二百人的一幕。就算很熱鬧。地密爾的新片成功了之後。可以挽回頽勢不少。</p>
<p>佳片預告</p>
<h3>明星又一新片將公映嘯谷</h3>
<p>明星公司因爲要增加出品，這幾個月，又竭力羅致導演和演員，預備多分幾組開拍，除演員方面，已添聘了胡萍，孫敏，艾霞，和正在接洽中的宣景琳王瑩等以外，導演是添了一位李萍倩，李君在天一公司多年，他第一部導演的，是王乾白，所編的（舊恨新愁），這是一件因戀愛而發生痛苦的故事，情節是非常錯綜，由龔稼農，艾霞，二人主演，現已在李君導演下，努力工作，不日卽將告竣，預計在本月中旬，可以公映了，</p>
<p>影星雋聞</p>
<h3>明星的本來面目思沛</h3>
<p>笑匠卓别麟，在銀幕演戲時，總是蓄上了鬍鬚，身上着了腐舊的衣衫，脚上套一雙破皮鞋，可是他的本來面目，却是很漂亮英俊，祗以頻年辛勞，再加鬧了離婚以後，心境不佳，不以頭髮巳轉了灰白</p>
<h3>有嗅電影桀克</h3>
<p>科學萬能這一句話。在今日是千眞萬確無須再加證明的了。影戲這個玩意兒。因科學的進步。在近幾年來。已造成了驚人的紀錄。從前無聲無色的影片。現在甩爲有聲有色。風行全球。人們的喜笑怒駡。言談歌泣。以至宇宙間的山崩海裂。獅吼虎嘯。一切聲音。現在都容易在影片上聽得。現在又來了一個奇特消。説歐美科學家不久將發明有嗅電影了。我們如果相信科學萬能的話。那末這個消息是靠得住的。這個消息的來源是這樣。英國科學會。今年九月裡。在倫敦開會。有一個科學家宣稱。他十分相信有嗅電影“Ｓmellies”不久將成事實。影片上的花的香味。我們快要嗅着了。從前好萊塢須要選影和配聲。此後將加以選擇氣味了。</p>
<p>色了。</p>
<p>曼琳黛維絲，在銀幕上，是個極美麗白嫩的姑娘，但她的本來面目，却生着許多雀斑。</p>
<p>范朋克臉極黑，滿面鬍髭，倘一二天不剃，同他的夫人璧克馥接吻，豎硬的髭，觸在嫩腮上，好的夫人或者竟會呼痛呢。</p>
<p>約翰吉爾勃，是電影界著名的小生人材，生得極漂亮英俊，但他的大鼻子，和長頭頸，是好萊塢著名的，倘不是服裝的領圈做得相稱，或者攝影師，對於攝影上的角度，稍不留意，那麽，他那長頭頸和大鼻子的缺點，就委容易暴露在看客的眼底。</p>
<p>騎術明星湯密克斯，到現在還飾演和少女們戀愛的西方牧童的角色，他巳近五十歲年紀了，額上巳生下深長的縐紋，幸虧有化妝箱，修容掩飾，所以望去還祗三十許人呢。</p>
<p>威廉包爾，時常飾演的，多半是流氓痞棍，但本人却是個高尙的君子，好萊塢人都稱他（威廉叔叔，）可見他忠厚和藹的一斑。</p>
<p>巳故電影明星郎却乃，專以化裝殘疾怪人，及表演刻毒殘忍之個性，見稱於世，惟本人則體格頗强，生性尤慈祥不過，即在他服務的米高梅影片公司的司閽人，他也屈尊相好，一些也没有傲慢氣槪，所以，當時惡耗傳來，説郎却乃死了，竟有不少人爲他落滬呢。</p>
<p>意見貢獻</p>
<h3>國産電影的簡評呂夢</h3>
<p>電影之在近代，可以説是盛及一時了！當然，這種事業的發展，不僅是完全由於社會人士的歡迎，而它存在的價値方面，實在也占着一個很重要的分子；這幾年來，國産影片如雨後春荀，替中國電影前途，放了不少光芒，我外論撰述</p>
<h3>十五年來蘇聯影片趨勢論（續）施誼</h3>
<p>｜根據ＨarryＡlanＰotamkin氏意見｜</p>
<p>在蘇聯影片，進程底研究中，我們不妨不妨一説及其電影藝術家之個人經歷。就普洛托珊羅夫（Ｐrotozanov）而言：他道演了「愛理達」，及「餐館之人」，這其中一片，是受了德國影響的最壞的片子，這種影響是屬於一種不正確的無産階級類型的；但在這以後，他也製作了幾部最好的喜劇，明細地描寫了侵略的「聖喬治恩之假日）及（西比利亞之哨兵」。普洛托珊羅夫，是蘇聯影片底息祖之一；他很早便提出了Ｍontage的理論。在他，雖然尙不願意忘郤他最初的過去之遣跡，然而他能夠用他那種特有的才智之「幽默」，賦予其影片以活潑之生命力，這是他善於自處的地方。</p>
<p>們不能不贊佩從事於電影事業者的精神和努力，可是缺憾的地方，還很多，所以我們認爲有討論的必要，</p>
<p>觀念的錯誤：現在一般電影界，往往以「肉感「風艶」來取悦於色慾狂的觀衆，而求滿售其賣座，這種低卑的心理，實在足以使電影本身破産；我不承認這是社會環境的驅使，而是一種觀念的錯誤，他們忘了電影藝術的眞義，是在於暗示行爲的改造，以致所製出的片子，大家都以「消遺品」及「玩意兒」視之，揮戈戕，不能不令人嘆息！</p>
<p>意識的幼稚；這是恐怕誰也不能否認的，固然，近代的歐美電影，也還配不上説意識都很高尙豐富，但是比中國總要好得多，本來「意識在影片中是最重要的，如果「意識」不强，對於觀衆就不會有什麽印象，甚至於有没有價値的危險，二十年來中國電影的毛病，壞在只知道「模彷」，而不知道「創作」，所以「意識」</p>
<p>上也受了莫大的影響，那末它的幼稚，當然也在絶對的可能性中，這種情形，我們祗要多看幾次國産影片，就能發覺，</p>
<p>導演的不精：在攝影過程中，負有最重要責任的，要算是導演者了，他是一個將可讀的劇本，譯爲可見的動作的人，他的任務旣然這樣着重，那末他的困難當然也隨着發生，所以做導演者非但要有充分的各種思想，並且還要有長時間的預備；可是中國電影導演者，類多草率從事，以致全部製成後，「破綻」叢出，片中情節往往有不「完全」和「紕繆」的地方，容易失去動作表現的整齊及精神，</p>
<p>以上所舉出來的，都是犖犖大者，其他瑣細還多着，因爲限於篇幅，不能作詳細的討論，就此停笨了，希望我國電影界多多的注意！　　二十一，十一，一，於江灣</p>
<p>本埠瑣聞</p>
<h3>一場汽車糾紛麥</h3>
<p>大凡明星們坐慣了自備汽車，一旦失去的時候，心裏頭仍舊是需要那闊綽物質上的享受，那麽没有的時候又怎樣呢？自然祇好去僱出差汽車，記得上月的月底左右，大明星張織雲，她在利利汽車公司包租了一輛一八三零六號的汽車，一連包了四天，到了五天頭上，（卽本月三日）利利車夫黄某，得到了一個織雲遷移的消息，所以他開了車子去找她要賬，車夫的知識也太淺薄，他不懂討賬的藝術，言語之間，難免衝撞了張女士，所以她喊了兩位西裝少年和一位千金小姐，就在弄内開起了交手杖！誰知這文弱的西裝少年武力不行，三拳兩手倒被車夫打入隂溝，弄得渾身污水，車夫乘機就跑去報了善鐘路捕房，捕房當卽派了包探周某，隨同車夫趕往張女士寓所，問起情由，車夫説「張女士租車四日，分文不付，並且推延時日，甚致於連利利的車都不乘而改乘雲飛的汽車，還要糾衆動武！」張女士怪車夫野蠻！失禮！並且打失了她兩顆鑽石和一隻手錶·包探就問她：「旣是打失了珍飾，當然要告發涉訟，」張女士很大方很坦然地説：「區區鑽石，小意思，無需涉訟了，」這一件事旣是本主不顧涉訟，可是拉回了本題目，還是要討賬，張女士約定他們晚上十時來取·</p>
<p>夜晚十時，周包探和利利司賬同去收欵，共結的數目是：八十一元五角，張女士打了一個折扣，付了六十四元五角，這樣纔把那事了淸·</p>
<h3>不要親戚明</h3>
<p>有許多好萊塢的大明星門、常常供給他們的親戚以金錢、或替他們親戚找着了職業、但是把那些親戚、總是送到離好萊塢遠些的地方、愈遠、那明星才愈痛快、因爲他們相信、有親戚是是好的、不過不要親戚在四週環爛縈着、</p>
<h3>嘉寳突然發見了！靄</h3>
<p>因爲有多少人、想知道ＧretaＧarbo嘉寳的個性和行動、所以紐約泰晤日報、特派了一位專門訪員、到歐州去追尋她、不料正在這記者乘的船上、第三天、突然發見一個很有誘惑性的古典女郎、只穿了短褲和襯衫、緩緩的踱到甲板上來散步、這就是踏破鐵鞋無尋處的嘉寳、使全船的人、都驚異到發呆、｜奇怪嘉寳、竟會如此狂放</p>
<p>電影專著</p>
<h3>皇帝受命於天一樣陳大悲</h3>
<p>孔子説過，「知之者不如好之者。了之者不如樂之者。」希望中國電影上獨創的正軌，我們就不能不希望多出些對於表演藝術好而樂之的忠實同志。因爲表演藝術不是讀幾篇高談闊論的文章就可以學得會的。所以僅僅求知是不夠的。非得好而樂之，學而時習之，是不能成功的。</p>
<p>「銀幕明星果然能夠自己造成的嗎？」這樣的問題，無論在美國或是中國，都是常常有人問的。這問題有甚麽價値？</p>
<p>試問，銀幕明星不由自己造成的，難道説，還得由他人造成不成？難道説，非得由天造成不成？</p>
<p>不錯。有許多人確實相信明星是天造地設的。這樣的人不但對於銀幕明星是這樣的想法，他們對於一切有所成就於各項事業中的特殊人都作如是想。</p>
<p>而且這種想法很適合一部分在銀幕上已經佔有位置的人底脾胃。他們自以爲得天獨厚。天給他們做明星，猶之乎從前的皇帝受命於天一樣。他們認定你們是無福受天之命的凡夫俗子，對於已成功的表演手段，只是望塵莫及，當然的，這輩子你們就休想成爲明星。明星的榮譽權利是應當由他們天才，永遠獨享獨佔的。</p>

<h3>The So-Called "Asia Economic League's" Future is Obscure</h3>
<p>(Cash hoarding) is the fundamental reason for today's market decline. (Commodity glut) is also the underlying cause of the current economic panic. Therefore, all countries in the world today are strengthening their defenses and raising their tariff barriers. Firstly, to prevent the outflow of cash, and secondly, to prevent the import of foreign goods, while promoting the export of their own products. However, because all countries are taking the same policies, international trade cannot help but suffer great obstruction. The economic situation of the market is becoming increasingly worse, and the turning point in the economy is becoming more and more unpredictable. Facing this crisis-ridden situation, the major powers cannot help but seek ways to regenerate themselves. Therefore, they are abandoning international cooperation and striving for (self-sufficiency). What is the way to achieve this? It is economic alliances.</p>
<p>In today's world, the British Empire is the one with the widest territory, the most diverse population, the most abundant production, and the most obvious contradictions. Since the Ottawa Economic Conference, it has abandoned its free trade policy of ruling the world, both in substance and in name, and is rushing headlong toward self-sufficiency. France wants to monopolize hegemony over the European continent and guide the various small countries of (Europe) to form an economic alliance. Although it has not been completed since it was promoted by former Foreign Minister Briand, it has never been forgotten for a moment. The economic union of the British Empire will further stimulate France's future ambitions. The United States of America is naturally gifted. After the European War, its economic advantage has long surpassed that of Britain. The countries of North and South America are naturally under the leadership of the (Monroe Doctrine). Therefore, although the economic alliance of the United States is not obvious in its form, it has actually been established invisibly. Moreover, the separation of the two oceans gives it a natural advantage. The emerging Soviet Union spans Europe and Asia. Although most of its land is barren, its area accounts for one-sixth of the world's landmass, and its population exceeds 160 million. After the Russian Revolution, it has worked hard to make progress. Recently, it has become another force, standing in stark contrast to the countries mentioned above. It is making every effort to give full play to its inherent functions and form a unique economic system.</p>
<p>Japan is in the midst of this economic frenzy. Even if it arbitrarily exerts its military force and aggressively invades the three northeastern provinces, its domestic weaknesses are even more exposed. Various phenomena since the outbreak of the world economic panic, such as commodity stagnation, increased unemployment, rural decline, and the closure of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises, etc., can all be attributed to human affairs and put aside for the time being. However, its country has meager natural resources. The iron buried underground is no more than 100 million tons, and the maximum amount of coal reserves is only 8 billion tons. The petroleum it needs, as precious as red blood, is only 1.2 billion barrels, even including Taiwan. Its poverty is so great that its position in Asia is similar to that of Italy in Europe. It is just boasting and bragging. If it encounters a strong enemy, and China can strengthen itself, how can Japan survive easily? It is well aware of its shortcomings, and has also witnessed the formation of economic alliances by countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, with small countries acting as their satellites, in order to consolidate their economic power. In this situation, Japan can hardly be content with the status quo. Therefore, it is making every effort to seize the three northeastern provinces by military force. In addition to economic control, it has expanded its political control, so that (Manchuria and Mongolia) have already fallen into its pocket from now on. Thus, it is developing its ambition and vigorously advocating its (Asia Economic League), also called (East Asia Monroe Doctrine). Its intention is that Japan should be in an absolute dominant position in East Asia. At the same time, it will use this position to compete with countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Our country is also being trampled on in this atmosphere. Japan is indeed arrogant and overconfident, but what is the actual situation? Since the Japanese army invaded the Northeast, the only excuse it has used is the security and order of the local area. However, before the September 18th Incident, the average number of monthly attack incidents on the South Manchurian Railway line was only forty or fifty. After the war began, order became even more unmanageable due to the maintenance of the Japanese army. Now, we only rely on Japanese materials to take the most objective view.</p>
<p>The number of times the South Manchurian Railway was attacked (after the September 18th War) is exemplified as follows:</p>
<p>Mid-November of last year (10 days) 342 incidents (Shanghai Daily reported)</p>
<p>Early February of this year (10 days) 572 incidents (Kwantung Government report)</p>
<p>Mid-July of this year (10 days) 429 incidents (Tokyo Jiji Shinpo)</p>
<p>Late July of this year (10 days) 634 incidents (Tokyo Jiji Shinpo)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, all are recorded in Japanese newspapers. This is enough to judge the value of Japan's highly touted self-defense and the so-called (East Asia Monroe Doctrine).</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan is a light industrial country, and it is well aware of this. Even if it has some financial capital, its strength is very weak. If it can cherish itself and resolutely refrain from invading China, it will not be difficult to continue to maintain its status as a strong country. However, it does not plan for this, but妄思吞并我中国,以为囊括三省,则(门罗主义)之恨基巳固,亚东牛耳稳执手中. How can it know that although China has failed to unite temporarily and fight with it in the battlefield with iron and blood, ethnic hatred has been deeply rooted in the minds of the Chinese people. Today, the heroic and desperate battles of the Volunteer Army are enough to show our Chinese people's perseverance and unyielding attitude. Therefore, this so-called Asia Economic League is a new cancerous tumor in the international community and also promotes another source of conflict in East Asia. Even if it considers aggression as a tool to create a new situation, it is actually the last road of imperialism. Can the so-called economic alliance become a reality? The guarantee of Japan's military power is the same as in the past, only a temporary victory. The final decision depends on how we work hard to predict.</p>

<h3>The Volunteer Army in Northern Manchuria Has Tremendous Momentum</h3>
<p>The general opinion in Harbin is that the situation in northern Manchuria is deteriorating daily. Commerce has stagnated. The Japanese army and the (Manchukuo) army are under the jurisdiction of (Manchukuo), and there has been no progress. The momentum of the volunteer armies in the east and west is very strong.

Li also dispatched Li Nao and his troops to take command in the Yilan area. They have already passed Fujin and are approaching Yilan. The Japanese are building a highway from Dunhua to Ning'an, which has been seized by our army commanders Ma Xianzhang and Wan Kui. The Japanese army dare not operate away from the railway. Except for several cities occupied by the Japanese army, the rest are in the hands of our army. Even bandits and the Big Sword Society have the determination to resist Japan.

<h3>Our Country's Proposal to the League of Nations Can Be Divided into Two Principles: A Brief Talk by Luo Wengan</h3>
<p>The Niuzhuang Incident and Responsibility for the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>Presenting a Counter-Proposal to Chapter 10 of the Report</p>
<p>Luo Wengan of Nanjing stated that the principles of our country's proposal to the League of Nations this time can be divided into two points. The first point emphasizes Chapters 1 to 9 of the League of Nations Investigation Committee's report, aiming to fundamentally clarify the issue of responsibility for the September 18th Incident in the Northeast and the January 28th Incident in Shanghai. After thoroughly clarifying whether the responsibility for the incident lies with Japan or China, other issues related to responsibility can be continuously discussed based on this principle, allowing the League of Nations to make a fair judgment and providing a resolution to the right and wrong of the Sino-Japanese issue. The first point also includes a separate explanation regarding Chapter 10 of the Investigation Committee's report. Because Chapter 10 is the Investigation Committee's suggestion to the League of Nations and is not definitive, our country should present a counter-proposal, while also providing a practical explanation based on China's factual issues. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Nanjing - The Council of the League of Nations will hold a meeting on the 20th to discuss the Lytton Report. Before submitting it to the Special Assembly, it will first be sent to the Committee of Nineteen for study. The Assembly is expected to convene no earlier than the end of the year or January of next year. According to reliable sources in diplomatic circles, the League of Nations, seeing that previous resolutions have not been implemented, has decided that this Assembly will first consolidate the opinions of various countries to ensure that this resolution can take effect and prevent this dispute, which is sufficient to affect the peace of the Far East, from being constantly delayed. Currently, all countries have reached a consensus on not recognizing the so-called "Manchukuo" and accepting the Lytton Report in principle, but the specific methods for resolving the Sino-Japanese issue still require detailed consideration. Therefore, it is expected that this Assembly will take a considerable amount of time to conclude. As for our country's strategies for responding to the meeting, the Foreign Affairs Committee has decided to issue instructions to the delegation, allowing them to respond flexibly during the discussion of the Lytton Report based on these instructions, rather than submitting a written opinion to the League of Nations meeting.

<h3>Liu Shishun Discusses Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Negotiations on the Sino-Brazilian Trade Treaty</p>
<p>The Dutch Boxer Indemnity Issue</p>
<p>The Sino-U.S. Arbitration Treaty</p>
<p>Liu Shishun, Director of the Department of European and American Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, stated that the Sino-Brazilian Trade Treaty was signed in 1887 and has been largely inapplicable for many years. In May of this year, it was agreed that the Brazilian government would revise the treaty. The Brazilian envoy to China, Wei Suoluo, came to Nanjing for this purpose and made contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then sent him a draft of everything related to this matter for his reference. However, the Brazilian envoy's intention to sign the treaty was too far from our side's original intention to sign the treaty, and nothing came of it. The Brazilian envoy has conveyed our side's views to his government and must wait for instructions from his country's government before coming to Nanjing to continue negotiations. As for the Dutch Boxer Indemnity, after the previous Dutch envoy, Baker, came to Nanjing and discussed the matter with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an exchange of notes was agreed upon. The Dutch envoy is now waiting for instructions from his government before signing. There has been no further progress recently. The reports in the newspapers about this matter are not factual. Regarding the Sino-U.S. Arbitration Treaty, it was signed by both parties in June of the 19th year of the Republic of China [1930]. However, because our Legislative Yuan at the time believed there were inappropriate aspects, it was delayed for two years, and our government has not yet ratified it. Now that times have changed, both sides feel the need to finalize it as soon as possible. Our Legislative Yuan has also approved it, and it has been formally approved by the National Government. Yan Heling has been appointed as the plenipotentiary representative. Once all procedures are completed, it will take effect. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>The Three Powers Maintain a Consistent Stance on Far Eastern Events</h3>
<p>Nanjing - Diplomatic authorities in Nanjing stated that the three major powers, Britain, France, and the United States, have adopted a consistent stance on Far Eastern events. The reason for this is that the recent issue of disarmament has had a significant impact on the international community's credibility. In order to maintain world peace, Britain and France are actively seeking the support of the United States for the League of Nations to increase its strength and authority. Therefore, the three countries have adopted a consistent stance on the Far Eastern issue. Recently, relations between the United States and Russia have become closer, and the United States' lack of sympathy for the puppet organization in Manchuria is very evident. Japan hopes that Soviet Russia will recognize the puppet organization. However, the Soviet-Japanese Non-Aggression Treaty is needed by Soviet Russia to maintain its interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway and northern Manchuria, preventing Japan from invading the eastern Russian territory of Siberia. Therefore, even if the treaty is signed, it will not be beneficial to Japan. Japan's repeated overtures to Soviet Russia are intended to alleviate the fears of its own people, embolden the puppet Manchukuo, and threaten the United States with the perceived closeness of the Soviet-Japanese treaty. Its intentions have been seen through by the international community. In summary, Japan has become isolated in the recent international situation. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>German General Election Results Show Papen Cabinet's Position Not Consolidated</h3>
<p>National Socialist Party Loses Thirty-Five Seats but Remains Largest Party</p>
<p>National People's Party and Communist Party Show Significant Gains</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 7th – Final count of the German general election: out of 44 million eligible voters, over 36 million voted, a turnout rate of 81.5% (compared to 83.2% in the previous election). The new parliament will have 582 members (compared to 608 in the previous one). Party distribution is as follows:</p>
<p>New Parliament　Percentage of Votes　Compared to Last Session</p>
<p>Seats　　　　Rate　　　　　　　Seats</p>
<p>National Socialist Party　　195　　33.2　　　　　　Decrease of 35</p>
<p>National People's Party　　53　　　8.0　　　　　　　Increase of 13</p>
<p>German People's Party　　11　　　1.8　　　　　　　Increase of 4</p>
<p>Center Party　　　　　　69　　　11.9　　　　　　Decrease of 7</p>
<p>Bavarian People's Party　　18　　　3.1　　　　　　　Decrease of 4</p>
<p>Social Democratic Party　　121　　20.7　　　　　　Decrease of 12</p>
<p>Communist Party　　　　　100　　17.0　　　　　　　Increase of 11</p>
<p>Farmers' Party　　　　　3　　　　　　　　　　　Increase of 1</p>
<p>Economic Party　　　　　2　　　　　　　　　　　No Increase or Decrease</p>
<p>Christian Social Party　　5　　　　　　　　　　　Increase of 2</p>
<p>Constitution Party (i.e., National 2　　　　　　　　　　　Decrease of 2</p>
<p>The above is the final revised result. The most notable trends in this election are the decline in the strength of the National Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Center Party, and the significant increase in votes for the National People's Party and the Communist Party. Farmers in East Prussia overwhelmingly supported Papen, resulting in the National People's Party doubling its votes compared to the previous election. Dissatisfied voters from the Social Democratic Party or the National Socialist Party rallied to the Communist Party, increasing their votes by over 10% compared to the previous election. In the previous parliament, the National Socialist Party, the Center Party, and the Bavarian People's Party, after forming an alliance, held a majority of seats, leading to a temporary trend towards forming a coalition cabinet. Now, the combined strength of these three parties is only 48.2%, no longer a majority. The National People's Party, the German People's Party, and the Farmers' Party, which support the Papen cabinet, hold only over 60 seats. Therefore, it is expected that if the National Socialist Party refuses to cooperate with Papen and join the cabinet, the government may dissolve the parliament again and call for an election to revise the constitution.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 6th – According to the initial reports on the House of Representatives election, the general pre-election predictions appear to have been largely confirmed. The National Socialist Party, which had made rapid progress since September 1930, lost some ground this time but remains the largest party in Germany. The National People's Party and the Communist Party showed significant gains. The National People's Party is the sole supporter of the current government. It failed completely in the House of Representatives election in July of this year, but has rebounded slightly due to the government's official support, though it still cannot be counted among the major parties. The Communist Party is making steady progress, and its current vote count is comparable to that of the Social Democratic Party. The Social Democratic Party lost some ground this time but remains the second-largest party. Its share of the total vote did not exceed 20%, and its influence, though significant, should not be overestimated. It is considered the primary defender of democracy, but its cautious approach is criticized by many workers as being too timid. The most surprising development today is the sudden growth in the strength of the Christian parties. This group is based on religious belief and represents the only political party of the middle class, consistently opposing the Papen cabinet. There is no doubt that this is the reason for their recent success. The crucial point of this election remains that no majority party can be formed in the new House of Representatives, making it impossible to form a cabinet backed by parliament. From this perspective, the outcome of today's election can be seen as a victory for the Papen cabinet. The only minority party supporting Papen (referring to the National People's Party) slightly increased its vote share, but it remains a very small number compared to the total number of German voters. Even so, Papen remains a victor.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 7th – After the election results were announced, National Socialist Party leader Hitler told a Reuters reporter that the German people had clearly expressed their opposition to Prime Minister Papen, and public opinion must be respected. The National Socialist Party still holds the position of the most powerful party, and we will achieve complete victory. The election results have further complicated the political situation. The future of the nation rests on President Hindenburg, and politicians are already seeking his opinion. The Papen government does not seem to intend to take any action but wants to observe the situation after the parliament is convened. The special points to note in this election are: 1) the sharp decline in Hitler's power, 2) the rapid advance of communism in the labor sector, 3) the aversion of the middle class to radicalism, 4) the opposition of the majority of people to Prime Minister Papen. The number of votes cast in July accounted for 84% of the total number of eligible voters, compared to 79% in the previous session, so the new parliament has 512 members instead of 608 as in July. The key figures of each party were naturally elected. The National Socialist Party lost over two million votes, thus losing 35 seats. The German National People's Party and the People's Party, both supporting the Papen government, gained 700,000 and 200,000 votes respectively. The 700,000 votes lost by the Social Democratic Party were gained by the Communist Party. The 200,000 votes lost by the Center Party were due to voters abstaining from voting. Notably, one in four people in the Greater Berlin area voted for the Communist Party. East Prussia has always been a stronghold of the National Socialist Party, but the number of votes for the National Socialist Party decreased by 114,000, while the number of votes for the National People's Party increased by 60,000. In Mecklenburg, where the National Socialist Party also holds power, both the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party lost 25% of their votes, allowing the National People's Party and the People's Party to gain some seats. Although the Papen government can boast that the number of government supporters has doubled compared to before, it still has to deal with a majority of opposition parties.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Berlin, 6th – In today's German House of Representatives election, the parties can be divided into three camps: 1) the reactionary faction, i.e., the National People's Party, supported by Hugenberg, and various small parties in the center; 2) the extreme right and extreme left, with revolutionary tendencies, i.e., the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party; 3) the democratic republican faction, centered on the Social Democratic Party and the Catholic Center Party. The Social Democratic Party has always opposed adventurous policies, and its political actions never exceed the bounds of the constitution. On November 7, 1918, the party leader Ebert (i.e., the first president) said, "If the German Emperor does not abdicate, a social revolution will surely occur. I not only do not want this kind of revolution to happen, but I also hate it very much." This year, the party still opposes adventurous actions but believes that the party's political actions and social actions are distinct. Therefore, when preparing for this election, it has changed its strategy and demanded agricultural reform. This proposition contains two main points: first, the socialization of large areas of land; second, the socialization of large industries. The party aims for future gains, not immediate victories. The party is confident in representing a stable force in the country. Although Germany is in turmoil, the party is confident that it still has a firm grip. The Catholic Center Party is the same as the Social Democratic Party. It neither violently opposes the reactionary dictatorial forces in the country nor sets up obstacles in the streets to confront them. Its policy is only to severely criticize the various actions of the dictatorial government. What it pays attention to is especially to ensure that the workers and people who have followed the party for many years can remain inseparable from it. The Center Party has always been able to seize opportunities, so it can establish connections in both the left and right factions. The Center Party firmly believes that after Germany's disastrous defeat in 1918, the country has gradually recovered because of stable political ideas, and the party is the representative of this kind of thinking, which is the same as the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<h3>Soviet Revolution Anniversary</h3>

<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 7th – Today, at the celebration held by the Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, Kalinin, he stated in his speech that although the situation has improved, the Far East has not yet passed the danger point, but the policy of Soviet Russia remains unchanged, that is, to live in peace with all countries.

As usual, the Army Commissioner Voroshilov gave a speech to the public, earnestly stating that Soviet Russia is striving for peace, but it must not forget danger in times of peace, so as not to be taken advantage of by the enemy.

<h3>Matsuoka Leaves Russian Capital Yesterday After Attending Russian Revolution Anniversary</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 7th – Matsuoka attended the 15th anniversary of the Soviet Russian Revolution today and watched the exercise of 50,000 elite Soviet Russian soldiers in Red Square. Afterwards, he told an Associated Press reporter that it was a "spectacle," and he was completely impressed. Recalling the army of the Imperial Russian era, today's Red Army is far superior to the past. In particular, the robust physique of the women's battalion and the magnificence of its military appearance are deeply impressive. Matsuoka Yosuke will leave Moscow tonight for Warsaw and Paris. The Polish Ambassador here has invited him to visit Warsaw, so Matsuoka plans to stay for a while and discuss the League of Nations incident informally with Polish officials. After arriving in Paris, he will begin to gather the Japanese diplomatic community to discuss Japan's handling of League of Nations procedures. It is expected that the meeting will be held in Paris for about a week.</p>
<h3>Invited a Famous Russian Reporter for Secret Talks</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 7th – Soviet Russian officials have not yet expressed their views on the issue of concluding a non-aggression treaty with Japan and the puppet organization in Manchuria. Therefore, it is widely rumored here today that the Russian government wants to restore normal relations with China and is unwilling to take any action regarding Manchuria. Matsuoka Yosuke, the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, invited a famous Soviet Russian news reporter, Radek, for a long talk today. It is reported that Matsuoka expressed to Radek that Japan wanted to obtain Soviet Russian guarantees of Japan's security in Manchuria because the Japanese felt that the existing guarantees were not sufficient. He also said that if Soviet Russia had no territorial ambitions, then the Russian government's recognition of Manchuria (Manchukuo) would be a natural procedure. Radek replied that he could understand the Japanese people's psychology regarding this matter and the wishes of Minister of the Army Araki, but Soviet Russia only had one wish, that is, peace. Therefore, Soviet Russia has not interfered in the Manchurian dispute, nor has it inquired about the "Manchukuo" incident. It is also heard that Radek did not make any suggestions on a non-aggression treaty, nor did he express his support for the treaty. According to reports, Radek went to the Japanese Ambassador's residence at 5:00 p.m. today at the invitation of Matsuoka to meet with Matsuoka. The two immediately closed the door for secret talks and did not come out until 6:50 p.m. It is heard that Matsuoka advised Radek to travel to the Far East, saying that Radek was deeply trusted by the Soviet Russian people. If he could go to the Far East for an inspection, it would greatly help to dispel Soviet Russian misunderstandings about Japan's motives. He then explained that the psychology of the Japanese people was not focused solely on material things and that their policy towards "Manchukuo" was out of necessity. It is heard that Radek was quite moved by Matsuoka's defense and, when leaving the Japanese Ambassador's residence, was more sympathetic to Japan than before.</p>
<h3>Ridiculing America's Attitude Toward the Far East</h3>
<p>Japanese United News Agency, Moscow, 6th – Matsuoka Yosuke, the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, told a Japanese United News Agency reporter at the Japanese Embassy here this morning that he did not intend to discuss any issues at the League of Nations but would explain Japan's position in good faith. He said his mission was over, and he believed the League of Nations would understand Japan's position. If it did not change its attitude from the beginning, then he had decided to withdraw from the League of Nations decisively. The Japanese government should listen to the League of Nations' opinions, which are the most important event for world peace. At the same time, the League of Nations should also accept Japan's opinions. The attitude taken by the US government since the Manchurian Incident was based on the following two reasons: (1) The United States is worried that the establishment of "Manchukuo" will block American trade in the Far East and violate the principle of the Open Door Policy. (2) An inexplicable American-style concept of international justice. Regarding the first reason, he advised the United States to wait and see how things develop. However, the United States' concerns were premature. The second, the uniquely self-righteous concept of international justice of the Americans, only regards their own actions as legitimate and determines that all actions of other countries are improper. Its attitude is extremely arrogant. There is no other way to solve this problem except to wait for the American people to reflect on themselves.</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 6th – Professor Blakeslee, the American member of the League of Nations Manchurian Incident Investigation Team, gave a speech at the Foreign Policy Association tonight, saying that members of the investigation team and most Western observers believed that Japan's attempt to conquer bandits and militia would only lead to a replay of guerrilla warfare, the continuation of Chinese boycotts of goods, and increased animosity between China and Japan. To say that Japan will not accept the investigation team's report is still too early. Even if the Japanese government is unwilling to accept it at the moment, time may change its position. He hopes that both China and Japan can accept the report to help resolve the dispute as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Full-Scale Anti-China Propaganda</h3>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 6th – Matsuoka Yosuke, the Japanese representative to the next special session of the League of Nations, recently stated in an interview with a reporter from the Paris (Times) that: "My mission is to go to Geneva to explain Japan's position to the world, which should be understood but has not yet been understood. We believe that the establishment of Manchukuo is an element of stabilizing the situation, and the clarification of the overall situation and the peace of the Far East all depend on it. If we compare Manchuria with the chaotic situation in China, the progress of Manchukuo is clearly visible. If Manchukuo can set an example of an orderly, unified, and law-abiding model for China, as we hope, then the Japanese people will be the first to be happy. Soviet Russia provided assistance and expressed sympathy to the Japanese residents who were surrounded by Chinese troops in Manchuria. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Litvinov and Karakhan." Regarding the issue of a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty, Matsuoka only stated that "negotiations on this matter should be conducted through normal diplomatic procedures." The (Times) reporter added a note stating that "(members of the Japanese delegation were not without mockery of the Lytton Report)."</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 6th – The (Times) editorial criticized Matsuoka Yosuke's remarks, saying that "(seeing the Soviet Union's strong desire to conclude various non-aggression treaties, we at least believe that the Soviet Union intends to establish safeguards at present to avoid all dangers of war. The Soviet Union seems to attach particular importance to this kind of treaty, and if its policy goal is as generally stated, then we may as well test it. However, there is one condition that cannot be ignored, that is, to strictly guard against policies of a revolutionary nature, so as not to let it harm our country when we are unprepared. European countries have suffered disadvantages from this kind of policy, and this has happened repeatedly.)"</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, Will Return to His Post Soon</h3>
<p>Chinese United News Agency, Tokyo, 7th – Debuchi, the Japanese ambassador to the United States, entered the palace this morning at 11:00 a.m. to bid farewell to the Japanese Emperor. He is scheduled to return to the United States via the Siberian Railway on the 11th. Ambassador Matsushima and Ambassador Ota also held inauguration ceremonies in the palace.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister of Finance Explains New Budget Proposal at Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Total Expenditure Exceeds 2.1 Billion Yen</p>
<p>Decision to Issue Government Bonds Limited to 800 Million Yen</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 7th – The budget cabinet meeting was held at 10:00 a.m. today, and all cabinet members attended. First, Minister of Finance Takahashi explained the Ministry of Finance's draft in detail, followed by questions from Minister of the Army Araki and others. Next, Minister of the Army Araki and Minister of the Navy Okada requested an expansion of the limit for the issuance of government bonds. Because Minister of Interior Yamamoto supported Minister of Finance Takahashi, the result was that the issuance of government bonds was decided to be limited to 800 million yen. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Japanese United News Agency, Tokyo, 7th – At the budget cabinet meeting today, Minister of Finance Takahashi reported the results of the Ministry of Finance's examination of the budgets of various ministries. According to this, the current amount of annual expenditure is 2.1 billion and 5 million yen, the total amount of annual revenue is 1.337 billion yen, and the deficit in annual revenue is 768 million yen. This deficit will be offset by the issuance of government bonds. The main new requests from various ministries are 156 million yen for the Manchurian Incident expenses of the Ministry of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs, 148 million yen for the improvement of military equipment for the Army and Navy, and 193 million yen for the rectification of the current situation. However, there are other new requests from the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs that can be regarded as rectification of the current situation expenses, so the actual amount of rectification of the current situation expenses is 265 million yen. Minister of Finance Takahashi also reported the budget figures as follows:</p>
<p>(Annual Revenue) Regular Section 1,286,615 (unit: thousand yen), Temporary Section 818,467, Total 2,105,082</p>
<p>(Annual Expenditure) Regular Section 1,334,448, Temporary Section 770,634, Total 2,105,082</p>
<p>Military's Excessive Demands – The Japanese Cabinet held a cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 a.m. this morning to discuss the new budget. Out of the 140 million yen in new requests from various ministries, 80 million yen were cut by the Ministry of Finance. Various ministries expressed dissatisfaction, especially the Army and Navy. Out of the 379.5 million yen in new requests from the Army, 163.8 million yen were cut. Out of the 277 million yen in new requests from the Navy, 177 million yen were cut. The total amount cut from the military was over 340 million yen, so it was very dissatisfied with the Ministry of Finance and hoped to argue with Minister of Finance Takahashi at the cabinet meeting. The situation before the cabinet meeting was very tense. It is heard that the amount of budget revival requested by various ministries is as follows: (1) Army 145 million yen, of which 30 million yen will be paid from the reserve fund; (2) Navy 100 million yen; (3) Transportation 12 million yen; (4) Colonial Affairs 4 million yen; (5) Interior 31.7 million yen; (6) Education 10 million yen. The above revival requests amount to around 300 million yen. The revival requests from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Agriculture and Forestry, Foreign Affairs, Justice, and Railways will reach 50 million yen. In this way, the revival amount for general accounting is 350 million yen. How will the Minister of Finance cope with this difficult situation? Everything will be decided at this morning's budget meeting (Chinese United News Agency, Tokyo, 7th).</p>
<p>Chinese United News Agency, Tokyo, 7th – At this morning's cabinet meeting, Minister of Finance Takahashi first explained the constraints on Japan's finances, stating that the existing national debt at the end of October had reached 6.3 billion yen. The amount borrowed from the Bank of Japan this year was 700 million yen, which will be converted into long-term national debt in the near future. The amount of government bonds in this year's new budget approval is 700 million yen, and other special accounting requires another 300 million yen. If various ministries request revival again, the national debt at the end of 1933 will exceed 9 billion yen. In this case, Japan's finances will be declared bankrupt. Although the requests of various ministries are reasonable, they must focus on the country, so the requests of various ministries can only be approved for revival within the scope of the estimated amount of government bonds for the next year, which is 800 million yen, through emergency funding. Minister of the Army Araki and Minister of the Navy Okada first pointed out to Minister of Finance Takahashi that since the limit is 800 million yen for government bonds, there is no room for negotiation. However, the military fears that it will not be able to accept the Ministry of Finance's proposal and hopes to broaden the scope further. Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto also opposed limiting the amount to 800 million yen. Only Minister of Interior Yamamoto agreed with Takahashi's proposal, saying that the various departments of the Ministry of Interior were also very dissatisfied and repeatedly requested revival, but he persuaded them to respect the country's future and maintain financial credit, so they had a slight understanding.</p>
<h3>Japanese Youth President Kodama Arrested for Attempted Suicide</h3>
<p>Toyama Fully Confesses Assassination Conspiracy</p>
<p>Significant Blow to Blood Pledge Group Members' Activities</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 7th – Kodama Yoshio (30 years old), the leader of the Independent Youth League and a person implicated in the assassination plot of senior officials of the Tianxing Society, learned of the Metropolitan Police Department's activities and fled without a trace. Yesterday afternoon at 10:30 p.m., Kodama went to a friend's house in Nakayama Town, Higashikatsushika District, Chiba Prefecture, where he was discovered by police hiding there and arrested. Kodama immediately took out a pistol from his pocket and shot himself in the chest in an attempt to commit suicide. This morning, he was sent to Shioda Surgery at Tokyo Imperial University Hospital. The bullet stopped in the lower part of the scapula of his left shoulder, which was quite serious.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th – Kodama, the creator and leader of the Youth League, had been hiding because his conspiracy was discovered, but he was finally arrested last night. At the time, Kodama attempted to shoot himself, causing serious injuries. It has now been determined that Kodama had been repeatedly imprisoned for reactionary activities. In 1928, he attempted to directly petition the Japanese Emperor. In 1929, he interfered with the May 1st parade. Last year, he sent a dagger to the deceased Minister of Finance Inoue to show intimidation. It is heard that Kodama and Toyama's third son will both be charged with participating in the May 15th assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi and others. Their crimes are rebelling against the current government. One day, they will be interrogated together with the other three masterminds.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 7th – Regarding the assassination conspiracy of right-wing groups, the result of the Metropolitan Police Department's crackdown on Tianxing Society members Yudoku Akada, Shiro Urakami, Isamu Koyanagi, Toshio Shintani, Youth League member Rihei Okada, Katsuo Shiba, etc., revealed an extremely terrifying plan. The masterminds were Akada and Urakami, who were waiting for the return of Zijiyama Juku head from Manchuria in late July to plan the second assassination. They made a betrothal with Okada of the Youth League and had begun concrete preparations. When the Zijiyama Juku head was investigated by the authorities, they set up the Yōshin Gijuku, which belonged to the Tianxing Society, and each took on a task. The first execution was undertaken by Okada, who took advantage of the opportunity for various ministers and dignitaries to travel west to assassinate Prime Minister Saito and a high official in the Imperial Court. Meanwhile, Toyama Hidesan, who was being interrogated by the Metropolitan Police Department, suddenly became aware last night regarding the bombs that were darkening the capital. He confessed everything with a very sincere attitude, including how he participated in the May 15th Incident, how Inoue, Hoshi, Furuya, Eiji, the Zijiyama Juku head, etc. acted, and how Lieutenant Navy Kuchi obtained a pistol from the Zijiyama Juku head, etc. Therefore, the May 15th Incident can be considered to have come to an end in fact. Toyama himself is currently detained in the Ichigaya Prison. Since the Blood Pledge Group, 36 members of right-wing groups have been arrested.</p>
<h3>Prediction of the American President: Roosevelt Seems More Likely</h3>
<p>Havas, New York, 6th - (New York Times) reports that informed observers of the political situation in the Democratic and Republican parties believe that Democratic candidate Roosevelt can win at least thirty-nine states out of the forty-eight states. More than two hundred people hold this view. Most newspapers believe that if Hoover wants to be re-elected, he can only rely on divine help.</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 6th - America's forty million voters are resting today, preparing to listen to the final speeches in the election campaigns of President Hoover and Governor Roosevelt tomorrow. Roosevelt has completed his week-long speaking tour, and tomorrow's broadcast speech will be the last major event on the Democratic agenda. President Hoover is preparing to speak in Salt Lake City tomorrow, broadcasting nationwide. However, due to the silver mining industry's dissatisfaction with the current government, even Republican leaders doubt whether Hoover's explanation of the Republican Party's attitude towards stabilizing silver prices can win back the hearts of the people of Utah. After his speech in Salt Lake City, Hoover may return to his hometown of Palo Alto by special train and will not give any more speeches. Currently, small bets on the election results have become five to one, betting on Roosevelt's victory. In addition, the total expenditure of the two parties in this election campaign is $1,960,000 for the Republican Party and $1,161,412 for the Democratic Party, both of which are far less than the previous election.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<h3>Fierce Battle Between Deng Tiemei's Troops and Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Deng's Officers Arrive in Beiping to Discuss Situation at the Front</p>
<p>Dong Rongjiu's Troops Temporarily Withdraw to Original Defense Due to Lack of Ammunition</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: The 28th Route of the National Salvation Army, led by Deng Tiemei, previously captured 15 Japanese instructors and translators in Xiuyan and executed them all. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese side sent troops to attack Deng's troops. Fierce battles took place several times in Huangtukan. An officer of Deng's troops arrived in Beiping yesterday (3rd) and discussed the battle situation in detail. He stated that our army previously captured nine Japanese instructors in Xiuyan. Later, the Japanese side sent four more Japanese and two translators from Shenyang to contact our army to rescue the captured Japanese. After our investigation, we found that their actions were secretive and were actually spying on our army's secrets. They were immediately detained, and on the 13th of last month, the Japanese and translators, 15 people in total, were executed. Upon receiving this news, the Japanese side sent more than 200 troops and colluded with Li Shoushan's Second Brigade of the Puppet Border Pacification Army to attack our army in three routes. Our side prepared defenses in advance and responded separately. The enemy's southern route arrived at Huangtukan in the southern third district of Fengcheng on the 17th of last month and encountered Zhu's regiment of our army in a fierce battle that lasted all day without a clear victor. Zhu's regiment retreated to Huangtukan, more than ten miles north, for strategic reasons. The enemy occupied Huangtukan. On the 20th, our side increased troops and, under the command of Commander Deng, counterattacked the enemy forces in Huangtukan, defeating them, killing their battalion commander Li (Li Shoushan's brother), killing nine rebel soldiers, and wounding more than 30. The enemy retreated to Andong. Huangtukan was recaptured by our army, seizing one pistol and thirteen large guns. Three of our soldiers were wounded. The enemy's northern route consisted of more than 100 Japanese and more than 400 rebel soldiers, who went west from Fengcheng and arrived at Kabaling. Our side deployed heavy troops there for defense, and under the command of Zhang Xiaoqian, Director of Training, Yun and Liang's regiments encountered the enemy troops on the 18th of last month in a fierce battle that lasted half a day. The enemy troops collapsed, killing five enemy soldiers, wounding more than 20, killing one of our soldiers, wounding five, and seizing six large guns. The enemy's central route consisted of 200 Japanese and 400 rebel soldiers, who went west from Andong and contacted our defense forces at Daxiao Lou on the 19th. After fighting for about three hours, the enemy collapsed towards Andong. Furthermore, Dong Rongjiu, Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Army, reported to a certain organization in Beiping yesterday that his army had temporarily withdrawn to its original defense on the second day of winter due to lack of supplies and ammunition, and the sudden cold weather, which made it impossible for the soldiers to endure wearing single clothes. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "On the evening of the 26th, I led my troops in three routes to launch a fierce attack on Jinzhou. On the evening of the 29th, Wang's brigade (Wang Yongliang) had broken through the north gate. At dawn on the 30th, the puppet Fengshan Railway Station was also occupied by Cao's brigade (Cao Zhenguo) and Gong Zhongjiu, Li Ronglu, and other troops of our army. The west gate was not captured due to the enemy's firm defense. The headquarters of the division in Jinzhou ordered the entire army to concentrate on defending the north gate, but our soldiers were determined not to fear their machine guns and artillery and continued to charge. The Broadsword Team was the backbone. From the 26th to the 2nd of winter, countless enemy soldiers were cut down. After the loss of the railway station, the enemy dispatched armored trains and a large number of troops to reinforce. Li Ronglu, commander of our First Detachment, and Hou Bifeng, commander of the Second Detachment, then commanded their troops to engage the enemy head-on. Li Shiming, commander of the First Brigade, and Gong Zhongjiu, commander of the Third Detachment, charged the enemy's left flank. Exhibition Commander Zhan Guosi commanded the remaining troops to attack the enemy's right flank. Brigade commanders and detachment commanders personally supervised the troops, and the fighting was fierce, with many enemy soldiers killed. Yesterday, on the afternoon of the 1st, at about 2:00 p.m., the enemy dispatched a large number of planes from the east and west to bomb our various units, causing considerable casualties. And tanks, armored vehicles, etc., covered their infantry, cavalry, and artillery, advancing towards our army, and a fierce battle broke out. That night, the weather suddenly turned cold, and the soldiers were wearing single clothes, making it impossible to endure. In addition, the enemy's mountain artillery and field artillery posed an increasing threat, and our army had been fighting bloodily for six or seven days without stopping, and was extremely exhausted. Our reinforcements were also insufficient, and ammunition was lacking, making it impossible to continue fighting. To avoid losses, I had no choice but to lead the various brigades and detachments to temporarily withdraw to our original defenses on the morning of the 2nd of winter, awaiting the full army to rest and reinforcements to follow. We are determined to fight the violent Japanese to the death, eliminate the puppet state, eradicate the traitors, restore our country, return our mountains and rivers, and sacrifice our lives to repay the country, vowing not to return alive. Respectfully reported by telegram, I hope you will consider this. Dong Rongjiu, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, bowed on the seal of winter.

<h3>Joint Attack on Longsha by Ma and Su's Armies</h3>
<p>More Than 500 Japanese Soldiers Killed in the Battle of Fularji</p>
<p>Japanese Side's Attempt to Seek Peace with Su Bingwen Results in Failure</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The situation in Manzhouli remains in a state of confrontation between strong bows and crossbows. The Japanese side dispatched a representative for peace, Jin Xianli, the puppet mayor of Qiqihar, who originally planned to go to Zhujiakan on the 22nd to meet with Su Bingwen's representative. However, on the evening of the 22nd, the Northeast Iron Blood National Salvation Army suddenly launched a fierce attack on Fularji with four regiments of troops. The Japanese side desperately resisted, and the fierce battle lasted for a day and a night, stopping on the 23rd. Although Fularji is still in the hands of the Japanese army, the railway line four li away from the city, which is a strategic point of contention, is completely occupied by the National Salvation Army. Jin Xianli was afraid and did not dare to go. Currently, the National Salvation Army is taking a large encirclement approach towards Fularji and Qiqihar, echoing the Xu Zihe army under General Ma Zhanshan. All areas within five li outside Qiqihar belong to the righteous army. The Japanese army, in cooperation with the puppet army, is guarding the city walls and constantly firing cannons to demonstrate. The residents of Qiqihar are moving to Harbin and Changchun to avoid danger. On the 27th, Su Bingwen convened a military conference in Zhalantun, attended by all officers above the rank of battalion commander, deciding to concentrate forces in Zhalantun, placing Turciha (15 li from Fularji) at the front line, Nianzishan at the second line, and Zhujiakan at the third line, gradually moving forward step by step. The commander-in-chief of the front line is Zhang Yuting, the regimental commander of Zhang Dianjiu's troops. The soldiers all wear armbands with the words "Northeast Iron Blood National Salvation Army" printed in black on a red background, and they are exceptionally brave in every battle. In the recent battle of Fularji, the Japanese army suffered more than 500 casualties. The sound of cannons can be heard in Angangxi, which shows the intensity of the battle. Japanese planes recently dropped bombs in Hailar and Boketu, but they were all repelled and the bombs did not hit any important targets. Therefore, it has become difficult for planes to go to the western front for reconnaissance. Su Bingwen is still using an ambiguous approach to deal with the Japanese side, so the Japanese side does not know whether to laugh or cry. Moreover, because more than 800 Japanese residents are being held in Haiman and other places, the Japanese side has many concerns and dares not advance troops rashly. Su is also using this point to restrain the Japanese. In addition, the Japanese planes came to drop bombs, so he sent a special letter to the Russian Consul Slunov in Manzhouli, informing the Japanese side that if they could stop the bombing, they could first release the Japanese women and children, and men who had not resisted. Yamazaki, the Japanese consul stationed in Manzhouli, then opened a list while in confinement and handed it to the Russian Consul for transmission to Su. Although Su has already accepted the list, he has not yet made a decision to release them. Captain San Shansugi, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy in Russia, and Mr. Toyohara, the consul stationed in Heihe, have jointly gone to the Mazifu station on the Russian border near Manzhouli, pleading with the Russian Consul to discuss with Su to send a representative for direct negotiations. The Japanese side claims that this is the last hope, and if it is not successful, they will have to resort to force. However, the righteous army in Heilongjiang Province is encircling Qiqihar, and the Japanese side is already feeling at a loss to cope with it. It is doubtful whether they have the strength to advance towards the Haiman line. Li Haiqing's army is currently operating in the Harbin-Angangxi section of the railway, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Li Tiande's army is occupying Zhaodong, coordinating with Li Haiqing's army. Another unit is approaching Angangxi, so the Japanese army must take care of the traffic on the South Manchuria Railway in addition to Qiqihar. (October 30th)</p>
<h3>Results of the Sino-French Border Negotiations in Dongxing</h3>
<p>Sino-French Sides Conclude Memorandum</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Dongxing, a part of Qinzhou, Guangdong Province, is adjacent to the Gulf of Tonkin in French Indochina, where Chinese and foreigners live together, and disputes often arise. Recently, the provincial government specially set up a French secretary in the Dongxing County Government to handle local negotiations. Since then, minor incidents between Dongxing and the French territory have been resolved locally, unlike in the past when major negotiations would often break out. However, in July of last year, a border case occurred in Dongxing 𥐞 Street, and Zhu Zhaoshen, the diplomatic inspector of the five provinces of China, went to handle it. As a result, the two sides signed the Sino-French Memorandum on the Dongxing Negotiation Case for mutual observance. Until recently, the memorandum has been published. A record is provided below for the reference of those concerned with Sino-French border negotiations. The original memorandum states that one representative, Mr. La Garde, counselor of the French Embassy in China, representing the Vietnamese government, discussed the Dongxing 𥐞 Street border negotiation case with the authorities of Guangdong Province in Guangzhou. Realizing that there were misunderstandings that harmed the interests of both countries, they sincerely wanted to correct this unfortunate situation and further consolidate their mutual relations. Therefore, both parties agreed that the articles of the Sino-Vietnamese Border Police Implementation Regulations signed on May 7, 1896, and the Sino-Vietnamese Border Maintenance of Security Agreement signed on April 13, 1915, should be implemented in accordance with the spirit of honest cooperation and broad mutual implementation.

<h3>Bengbu Salt Tide Has Eased</h3>
<p>North Salt Public Camp Office Begins Operations</p>
<p>Various Salt Companies Have Also Returned to Their Original State</p>
<p>Miao Qiujie Comes to Bengbu to Find a Solution</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The North Salt Public Camp Office, run by Huai salt merchants, was vehemently opposed by the salt industry when it was first established in Bengbu, causing a tide. The establishment of the North Salt Camp Office was due to the fact that Huai salt flooded the Bengbu market, and supply exceeded demand, resulting in price drops and抢售. In order to reform the salt administration, two announcements were issued, one allowing salt merchants to directly buy and sell, and the other organizing a Salt Administration Consolidation Committee, which resulted in the production of the North Salt Public Camp Office. The committee also stipulated a number-selling method, such as numbers 1 to 10, which had different salt samples and prices. Customers could choose to buy at their own discretion, and there would be no monopoly or manipulation. However, these fifty-seven salt companies feared that they would be indirectly controlled by the Public Camp Office, indirectly eliminating their brokerage business, and losing the commission (1.9角 per担) they earned from evaluation, introduction, and running errands, resulting in激烈反. In fact, it was just a matter of survival. The salt merchants believed that the North Salt Public Camp Office was established by the salt administration officials to consolidate the salt administration, and its sovereignty was controlled by the salt envoy, which the salt merchants could not participate in. Now, the salt companies are not seeking a proper solution, but are asking the salt envoy to abolish it, and are directly opposing the salt merchants, which is a mistake in the target, and is also very激愤. They have made earnest defenses for the actions of the salt companies, but the salt companies said that the salt merchants were relying on their thick capital to deceive the salt envoy and approved the establishment of the North Salt Public Camp Office, and always believed that they were intentionally monopolizing. The salt merchants and salt administration agencies denied this extremely. Therefore, the salt companies and the salt merchants have been in a stalemate for days. Jin Xiangshao, the Commissioner of the Resident Bengbu Tax Collection Office of the Huaibei Salt Administration Audit Office, felt that he could not remain silent due to his official duties. He reported the demonstration and petition of the salt companies against the North Salt Public Camp to Salt Envoy Miao Qiujie for processing. He also believed that the long-term stalemate between the salt merchants and the salt companies would have a significant impact on the salt administration. Therefore, at 6:00 p.m. on the 4th, he convened a meeting at the Public Security Bureau with more than ten key figures from Fengyang Chief County Mayor Shi Guozhu, Bengbu Public Security Bureau Chief You Kaiyun, and the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce of the Salt Merchants Association and the Salt Industry Association to discuss mediation methods. It was decided that before receiving the explicit order and solution from the Lianghuai Salt Envoy, a compromise method would be determined, that is, the North Salt Public Camp Office would begin operations from the 5th, and the salt companies would also resume work and return to their original state. As for the dispute, they would wait quietly for the Salt Administration to resolve it. All parties were very satisfied with this temporary method. Yesterday (the 5th), the salt industry was operating as usual. This matter seems to have come to an end on the surface, but in the dark, they are still fighting and showing their supernatural powers. In addition, people from Wanbei who are traveling in Bengbu have been卷 入漩, organizing the so-called Wanbei Twenty-One Counties Committee Against the North Salt Public Camp Office, and recommending Yang Yaonan and other twenty-nine people as executive committee members to be responsible for handling negotiations and requesting abolition. The various circles in Bengbu will also establish similar groups against the North Salt Public Camp Office to provide strong support. The salt administration dispute is turning into an expansion trend. This morning (the 6th), Salt Envoy Miao Qiujie specially came to Bengbu by car from Banpu with the British Mr. Pearson, a洋员 from the Audit Office, to resolve this matter. Jin Zhuan, Commissioner of the Salt Administration Tax Collection Office here, and the salt merchants and people from the salt companies received the news in advance and went to the station to meet them. Miao and others got out of the car and went to the Salt Administration Tax Collection Office to stay. In the morning, they convened representatives of various salt companies at the office to talk, and in the afternoon, they convened representatives of salt merchants to talk, separately consulting their opinions and discussing practical and effective compromise methods to completely resolve the problem. The Committee Against the North Salt Public Camp Office, organized by people from Wanbei traveling in Bengbu, also recommended representatives to visit and state their opinions. According to Miao's statement, Lianghuai is an important salt production area in China. In the past, the salt production volume was the highest in Huainan. In the past 20 years, Huainan's production has gradually decreased due to changes in the coastal salt fields, and Huaibei has become the area with the highest salt production. The people of the four provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, and Henan mostly rely on this for food. In recent years, due to the decline of river transport, most of the salt is transported by sea and car. The transport is convenient, and the sales are naturally high. The annual salt tax collected is nearly 30 million yuan. Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance pays special attention to the salt administration of Lianghuai. Projects such as dredging rivers and building 坨 are being carried out vigorously. It has been decided to build seven large salt farms in Huainan and twelve in Huaibei with 1.4 million yuan. It is estimated that all projects will be completed by the end of next year at the latest. Wanbei has been a free sales area since the abolition of the 引岸 system nearly 20 years ago. Bengbu is the largest commercial port for selling Huai salt in Wanbei. The highest tax collected was more than 6 million yuan. However, since last year, due to the impact of natural and man-made disasters, the social economy has declined, and people lack the ability to purchase. Therefore, the sales volume of Huai salt is far less than before. The salt tax collected last year was only more than 2 million yuan. And because the transport is free, the number of salt merchants with small capital has increased sharply. The salt transported has therefore become surplus. Since the salt supply exceeds demand, small merchants try to sell it off due to stack rent and discount interest, so the price drops. Other salt merchants also抢售, resulting in a very unstable situation. In order to consolidate the salt administration, the North Salt Public Camp Office was organized to display salt samples and allow customers to purchase them. In order to prevent monopoly and price increases, it is stipulated that a six-month trial period will be implemented. Salt companies are allowed to have tooth licenses and operate as brokers, which are not prohibited by the salt administration officials. However, merchants should not entrust salt companies to intermediate evaluations, and salt companies should not force customers to follow. If customers are willing to entrust salt companies to purchase on their behalf, it is naturally free. I came to Bengbu this time to first convene representatives of salt companies and salt merchants to consult their opinions, so as to use appropriate methods to resolve the dispute. I have no prejudice whatsoever. Judging from Miao's expression, the salt camp dispute may be resolved within a day. (6th)</p>
<h3>The Cause of the Japanese Ship Shiraha Maru Running Aground</h3>
<p>Carrying over 8,000 Tons of Ore from Daye</p>
<p>Strayed from the Course Leading to Erroneous Impact with Reefs</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Customs, Concerned About Mineral Ore Being Dumped into the River as a Precaution</p>
<p>Has Dispatched Personnel to Monitor and Set a Deadline for Unloading</p>
<p>The Japanese ship Shiraha Maru ran aground at Beixingzhou near Zhenjiang at 7 a.m. on the 3rd. This reporter investigated the Zhenjiang Customs, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, and Hengda Customs Brokerage yesterday, and found discrepancies from the outside rumors. Originally, the mineral ore produced annually in Daye Ma'anshan, Wuhu and other places in our country contains a lot of iron and the output is quite large. Because there is no perfect iron smelting plant in the country, it is taken away by the Japanese without compensation. In the past, it was customary for commercial ships from that country to carry coal and other goods to Hankou and Yichang, and then transport mineral ore on the return trip, which has been the case for more than a year. Recently, due to the impact of imported goods, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha reluctantly dispatched three ships on the Yangtze River line for route relations, loading daily necessities for Japanese residents. This time, the Tatsuma Kisen Kaisha's Shiraha Maru arrived at Daye at the end of last month with more than 8,000 tons of ore. At 7 a.m. on the 3rd, when it arrived at Beixingzhou, about six miles upstream from Zhenjiang, it ran aground due to the shallow and dry river and straying from the course. It immediately telegraphed for help. Two Japanese warships (Ogi) and (Fuji) have arrived from Nanjing to rescue it. However, because the front of the first cabin is leaning forward, it cannot be towed. Hengda Customs Brokerage, which manages the ship, has reported it to Zhenjiang Customs. Zhenjiang Customs is worried that the Japanese ship will dump mineral ore into the river, blocking the river flow, and has dispatched personnel to station on the ship to monitor and set a deadline for unloading the mineral ore onto other ships.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Withdrawal of the Boundary Demarcation Proposal  The originally scheduled meeting on the boundary demarcation between Shangchuan, Songjiang, Nanhui, and Fengxian Counties was to be held on the 11th at Huaan Life Insurance Company on Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai, with the participation of the county magistrates of each county and two local gentry members for discussion. County Magistrate Shen of this county approved the consultation and instructed the 14th and 15th districts to comply. Now, it is learned that Nanhui's proposal to include Chenjiahang Township of Shanghai County under the jurisdiction of Nanhui was rejected by the Civil Affairs Department as unreasonable. Therefore, Fengxian's attempt to delineate a section of the 14th district of this county was also reported to the provincial government and requested to be withdrawn as it was not very relevant. Therefore, it seems that there is no need for Shangchuan and Songjiang Counties to attend this Shanghai County boundary demarcation meeting. After the consultation from the county arrived in Songjiang, County Magistrate Shen has instructed the relevant districts to exempt representatives from being sent.</p>
<p>The Opium Public Sale Office Will Soon Open  It is rumored in the market that a certain Xie from Shanghai has been sent to Songjiang to open an opium public sale office, with many staff members. They have now contacted various places and rented a house owned by a certain person in Bailongtan to organize an office called the Sanhe Company. The opening date is approaching.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Business Tax Bureau Strictly Pursues Tax Payments  Since taking office, Xia Zhenlong, the director of the Wuxi Business Tax Bureau, has been earnestly rectifying, and he has been particularly strict in conducting investigations. However, due to the water disaster in Xishan last year and the subsequent Shanghai war, the market has been extremely depressed, and business has been sluggish. Moreover, the business tax rate has suddenly increased by one and a half times this autumn, so many people are unable to pay. However, the bureau is very strict in collecting payments, and most people have reluctantly paid the spring and summer seasons first. However, industries such as rice, money, cotton yarn, flour, sauce and wine, grain, rickshaw, and coal have either paid the brokerage tax or have special business circumstances, and have failed to declare on time. They have successively requested Director Xia to consider the difficulties of the merchants and consider both tax revenue and business conditions. Director Xia, however, stated that the provincial government is urging the remittance of tax payments urgently. Yesterday, he specially reported the above-mentioned industries to County Magistrate Lu and summoned the leaders of each industry to a meeting to discuss and urge them to resolve the matter as soon as possible. The industry directors stated their difficulties in person and promised to discuss a solution immediately.  An Old Farmer Committed Suicide by Hanging Due to Injustice  In Caozhuangli, Changbang River, Zhangjingqiao, Huai Shangshi, the 7th district of the county, Xu, the wife of Wang Renquan, a villager, was nearly forty years old, naturally fierce and specializing in gossiping, hence the nickname "long-tongued woman." On the 4th of this month, Xu suddenly falsely accused Chen Jinfu, the neighbor on the right, of stealing manure, and scolded him all day long for two days and one night without rest. However, Chen Jinfu was sixty-two years old, honest by nature, and felt deeply wronged by this false accusation, so he became disgusted with the world. He hanged himself in his room early in the morning the day before yesterday without anyone knowing. When his wife discovered it, he had already died of suffocation. His wife was extremely saddened and cried bitterly. Later, she reported it to the Township Office and requested to appeal the injustice. The village chiefs Wang Zhihe and Wang Sanyuan, among others, came forward to mediate and ordered Wang Renquan to pay 40 yuan in funeral expenses as a settlement. A case of a life lost due to stealing manure was thus resolved.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Private Issuance of Cash Chips  The shops such as Dingfeng Liu Xinchang in Meicun Town, the 10th district, privately manufactured cash chips, which were popular in the market and disrupted the financial order. The county government strictly ordered Yuan Yongtang, the district head of the district, to ban them. District Head Yuan issued a notice ordering each household to prohibit them all at the end of last month and to collect them on their own. Unexpectedly, the shops still disobeyed in secret, and cash chips were still rampant in the market. After District Head Yuan learned of this, he went to the Meicun Town Office with assistant Qin Zhicang yesterday morning and summoned the town head Chen Shengshan and the shopkeepers of each cash chip issuing shop to the office, urging them to prepare cash as soon as possible to redeem the cash chips outside. He also granted a grace period of half a month, allowing them to be collected in full by the 15th of this month. The shopkeepers were ordered to hand over the unissued cash chips and burn them first. After all the chips were collected by the 15th, they would be burned for the second time. Soon, the shopkeepers complied with the order and handed over the cash chips stored in their shops, totaling about 200,000 wen, piled up in front of the town office and burned together under the supervision of District Head Yuan.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Schools in the Fourth District Petition the County Bureau  Educational funding in our county has been in arrears for eight or nine months. The principals of each school all have the lament of a clever housewife. However, the education authorities, because of the precedent of arrears, do not try to plan, but instead issue half a period every one or two months to deal with the situation. Now, the schools in the fourth school district, because they see that the arrears are huge and difficult to cope with, gathered at their respective villages the day before yesterday to discuss solutions. As a result, it was decided to send twelve representatives to the city on the 5th to petition the Education Bureau to release the arrears. The Director of the Education Bureau, Yu Cheng, said that one period, half old and half new, could be released between the 15th and 20th of this month, and there was no guarantee beyond that. The representatives, unable to find a satisfactory solution, went to the County Government in the afternoon to petition.  The Matricide Case Will Be Retried in Suzhou In the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic of China, Cai Yizhi, a gentleman from Baoben Street in this county, conspired to seize property, and colluded with rickshaw puller Zeng Zeng, his wife Jin, and his concubine Li, to strangle his adoptive mother Cai Qu to death on the night of October 10th. Subsequently, Qu's son-in-law Weng Qiaosheng and others sued the county. After the county examined and verified the facts, Cai Yizhi and the two rickshaw pullers were sentenced to death, and the wife and concubine were sentenced to life imprisonment. Cai and others refused to accept the sentence and repeatedly appealed to the High Court and the Supreme Court. After several years of transfer, the Supreme Court finally ruled on the matter last month and sent it back to the High Court for retrial. Now, the High Court has scheduled the retrial in Suzhou on the 8th of this month. The rickshaw puller Qian Zeng and concubine Li have already passed away. It is not yet known whether there will be any changes during the retrial.</p>

He identified himself as Wu Tie'an, a secret investigator of opium for the Department of Civil Affairs, and accompanied by the resident patrol officer of the bureau, went to designated locations to investigate and arrest opium and gambling activities. However, nothing was found. Later, the resident patrol officer suspected his behavior and feared that he was an imposter. He was immediately arrested and sent to the headquarters. Under interrogation, he confessed that he was indeed an imposter and also admitted that he went by the name of Tushan and that he had friends Su Pinshan and Xu Jiasong, who lived in Kangshan in the city. The bureau then dispatched Inspector Lang to lead the police to arrest them together. A suitcase was found in Wu's residence (No. 29, Dalu Hostel), as well as Wu Tie'an's business card, wooden seals of Qian Jiaqi of the Third Section of the Jiangsu Department of Civil Affairs, symbols such as Wu Xiang, the deputy adjutant of the 264th Brigade of the 88th Division, and the deputy adjutant of the General Political Training Department of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and two forged instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs.

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Lu Dipin's Condition Slightly Improves  Lu Dipin, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, suffered a stroke and fainted at a banquet for the Fifth Provincial Representative Conference the other day.

He has been resting in the chairman's office for days due to his serious illness. He also extended an invitation to Chinese medicine practitioner He Gongdan for diagnosis and treatment. Because the chairman suffered from hyperemia that has not yet healed, the provincial government specially sent clerk Li Xiyi to Shanghai on the 6th to invite Director Le of the Red Cross Hospital to Hangzhou for diagnosis and treatment. Lu's condition has slightly improved. His hiccups stopped at 1 a.m. this morning (the 7th). He had some bread in the morning, but he is still dizzy, his hands are numb, and he hates noise.

<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Entire City's Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Shut Down Due to Excessive Taxes  The 80-plus tobacco and alcohol businesses in the Hefei urban area have been subjected to a unified tax collection for the urban area and suburbs for more than ten years, with monthly revenues of only a hundred-plus yuan. The current contract holder for the urban area and suburbs of the tax collection bureau suddenly increased the tax amount tenfold. Those who were responsible for collecting three yuan of alcohol tax were increased to thirty yuan, and those who were responsible for one yuan of tobacco tax were increased to ten-plus yuan. This was already unanimously opposed. However, yesterday, the tax collection bureau investigated the goods in Yixingshun Tobacco Shop on Beirujie Street and had a verbal conflict, arresting the shop owner Li Jingbao and sending him to the county government for detention, causing a great uproar. On the 3rd, all the tobacco and alcohol shops in the city were closed, and a petition was submitted to the head office for relief.</p>
<p>Major Fire Outside the West Gate  There has been no rain here for several months, and the drought is extreme. The rivers and wells are dry, and the two wheat crops cannot be planted safely. The farmers are afraid of famine. Unexpectedly, at noon on the 2nd, a fire suddenly broke out at the Xu surname house next to Shdashan on Erlijie Street outside the West Gate. At that time, the south wind was strong, and the north and south streets were both affected. Moreover, there was no water for rescue, so the situation became more severe. The Liuhe Automobile Station was also burned down. Fortunately, the military police dismantled the connecting houses on all sides and extinguished the fire after two hours. A total of 14 households and more than 140 houses were burned down. After 7 p.m., a haystack behind Pingliang Villa on Gulou Street in the city caught fire again for unknown reasons. Fortunately, it was in a busy market, and military police and water dragons all arrived to put out the fire, and only three houses were burned.</p>

Recently, the central government decided to organize a committee, hire many educators in the country, and based on the education proposals accepted by the previous central governments, conduct a detailed research to formulate a practical implementation plan and submit it to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee for deliberation and decision, so as to achieve the principle of rationalizing education and cultivating healthy citizens.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the representatives' request to punish the bookstore that published words insulting Islam, after discussion, it was stated that during the national crisis, one should not publish words that harm national feelings. It was advocated that the Beixin Bookstore should be severely punished, Nanhua Literature and Art should be suspended, and the author of this article should be punished according to law. In the future, any publication is prohibited from publishing words that provoke national feelings. Efforts should be made to improve the teaching materials of various schools so as to integrate the differences between ethnic groups. The Propaganda Committee and the Executive Yuan will be responsible for handling this matter separately.</p>

<h3>Central Government to Formulate Overall Education Reform Plan</h3>
<p>Political Conference to Deliberate at Length Before Submitting to the Third Plenary Session; Central Committee Members Discuss Three Failures of Current Chinese Schools and Social Education</p>
<p>Nanjing, 7th Dispatch: This morning, at the Central Government Discussion Meeting, Central Committee members expressed three opinions on education reform: 1. Today, not only higher education has failed in China, but also elementary education and social education are nominal and lack substance or a unified plan. Therefore, the general public has a very weak concept of the country, leading some to willingly become traitors and accomplices. If social education were well-managed, such things would not happen. 2. In the past, in addition to inappropriate education systems or policies, many textbooks used in primary and secondary schools today are also unsuitable for the needs of the times. In the future, strict review or revision is necessary. 3. Current popular movies, dramas, novels, poems, and other content rarely improve society or stimulate national spirit, with most being works of love or mythology. This is directly related to social education and must be considered in the overall plan for education reform. As a result of the discussions, the committee members proposed submitting these opinions to the Political Conference for a comprehensive plan and assigning several additional members from the Executive Committee to discuss it together within two weeks. Once the overall plan is finalized, it will be submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Executive Committee for a decision.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Tend to Decrease</h3>
<p>General Sentiments Soften. Yesterday, due to the first day of the Western Merchants' Autumn Horse Racing, the Gold Exchange followed the usual practice of only conducting transactions for half a day in the morning session. The gold price situation continued to show signs of fatigue. Although there were no dramatic changes, from morning to noon, there were still seven taels of fluctuations. Ultimately, it fell four taels and two qian compared to last Saturday. Market sentiment was weak, and supply and demand varied. Initially, weakness was observed. Although silver prices did not move, large bars slightly increased, mainly due to the rise in American cotton. Subsequently, as foreign exchange rates eased and sellers became active, the 740 tael mark was broken. Later, as exchange rates stabilized and buyers were eager, it was reported that the Central Bank repeatedly opened spot sales at a price of 40 taels and 0.05 qian, sold by Dadecheng, Dafengheng, and others. This caused the gold price to rebound. Afterwards, it remained around 40 taels with some small changes. The detailed morning situation will be recorded below.</p>
<p>Down Four Tael and Two Qian. The opening price for December was 744 taels and 7 qian, slightly down 2 qian (before the market opened, the black market price was 45 taels, briefly reaching over 6 taels before retreating to within 5 taels). The Dalian gang first sold slightly, followed by 4 taels and a half. It quickly returned to one tael, as Hengxingshunlifuyutianfenyonghenxing and others entered. When the initial US dollar price for the month reached 81.25, it became 45 taels and 0.34 qian. Yifeng posted a price because the Autumn Race normally starts half an hour earlier at 9:00 AM, but there was no change, at 5 taels and 0.02 qian. Yifenghengyiyifengyongyuantaizhifengyong and others also entered, immediately raising the price to 46 taels. Within a few minutes, there were fluctuations of several qian. Suddenly, the foreign exchange market seemed to ease. McKelliget initially bought February US dollars at 1.25, then 1.875, and then December at 30 yuan, but at 9:30, it was 4 taels and a half. Hengxing entered on behalf of a client, slightly adding 0.8 or 0.9 qian. At 9:45, it was 5 taels and 0.04 qian. Afterwards, there was a small correction, with Fengyi and Li selling, along with Tongfengheng, Tongchang, Zhaofengchang, Zhifengyong, Yiyifengyong, Fuyutai, Hengyiyifeng, Daxing, Yongruixing, Yuanmao Yong, and others constantly selling. Furthermore, Zhongfu bought January US dollars at 0.25, and Hua Bi sold December at 0.0625. After 10:30, it suddenly broke 40 taels. Around 11:00, it was 39 taels. Later, rumors spread that the Central Bank had bought 140 spot bars, so Runchangyong, on behalf of Dafengheng and Dadecheng, Yingfengheng, Zhaofengchang, Qianchangxiang, Yongfengheng, Yutai, Xie Xingyong, and others rushed to buy. Furthermore, Old Citibank absorbed March US dollars at 0.375 and January at 1.875, so it pulled up again by 2 taels or so, reaching 41 taels and 0.07 qian at 11:30. Unexpectedly, ordinary retail investors came to sell, and Xiexingyong, Fuyu, Zhaofengchang, and Dadecheng吐反 again, suppressing it slightly by 1 tael. At 11:45, it was 40 taels and 0.04 qian. Then, it stabilized, slightly picking up 0.03 or 0.04 qian. By noon closing, it was 40 taels and 0.07 qian, down 4 taels and 0.02 qian from last Saturday. According to the half-day high of 46 taels and the low of 39 taels, there was a difference of 7 taels. Red bars increased sharply by 11 taels and a half.</p>
<p>Fixed Prices Mostly Down Four Tael. The fixed price was still 814 taels, a reduction of around 70 taels. Afterwards, it was 75 taels, and finally 72 or 3 taels, a reduction of 4 taels compared to the end of last week. Accounting was done at 42 taels and 41 taels, with a supplement of 42 taels.</p>
<p>Not Much Counter Trading. Counter trading statistics show that Hengyu, Tongtaichang, Wanxing, Yuantai, Shunli, Yiyifengyong, and Dadecheng all bought. Bingxing, Daxingyong, Richang, Futaiheng, Yuanmaoyong, Ruixing (on behalf of Qiao Zhifu) all sold. Zhifengyong and Zhaofengchang sold more and bought less. Fuyu, Yuanchun, Hongkangyong, and Yuheshiy both sold and bought, seemingly scalping. Those covering US dollars bought. The Dalian gang bought over 500 and sold over 200. The Guangdong gang had no major transactions. Hengxing bought around 300, and Yifeng sold around 200.</p>
<h3>British and American Exchange Rates Shift from Stable to Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver and exchange market at the beginning of the week was, as usual, without electricity. The local exchange market was nominally stable but quietly loose.

British gold only had several tens of thousands of pounds, with HSBC and others having previously absorbed spot gold. American gold totaled approximately 560,000 yuan. Hengxing and Dadecheng and others sold off to cover call options, and the price difference was slightly far, with January being approximately 48 taels, February being 46 taels, and this month being 51 or 2 taels.

<h3>Silver Dollar Market on the First Day of Customs Closure</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the banks were closed in the afternoon as usual for the Western Merchants' Autumn Race. Because the previous day was Sunday, there was a lot of receipt, delivery, and various procedures in the morning, making it impossible to estimate. Due to the afternoon closure, it was impossible to investigate the results. Nothing was known about the various receipts and deliveries of foreign firms. Although some information was known about Chinese firms, the information was inaccurate because the Chinese exchanges were also closed.</p>
<p>Small Change in Price. Silver Dismantling Slightly Increases. The early market price for one silver dollar was 7 qian, 0 fen, 7 li, 8 hao, and 0.075 hu. The noon market price was 7 qian, 0 fen, 7 li, and 0.075 hu. The difference between the two markets was only 0.0125 hu.

Copper coins continued to decrease by 2,000 wen to 416,500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow Slightly Better Due to Closure. Due to the bank closures, it was impossible to investigate the receipts and deliveries of foreign firms. For Chinese firms, the receipts and deliveries of tickets totaled 2,560,000, tariff revenue was over 500,000, silver receipts and deliveries were over 900,000, the receipts and deliveries of Qianzhuang and Silver Public bonds totaled 23,000,000, and settlement fee receipts and deliveries were over 310,000.

Transactions at small Qianzhuan totaled over 500,000.</p>
<h3>Peculiar Changes in the Securities and Bond Market Yesterday</h3>
<p>｜Increased by 80 to 150 Cents Compared to Previous Days｜</p>
<p>｜Turnover Reached Over 5,800,000 Yuan｜</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 7th), the situation of various bond markets at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was as follows: most spot transactions opened, with a turnover of 37,000 yuan, of which 15,000 yuan for the 1929 Customs bonds was relatively large, with the rest being only a few thousand yuan. The forward market saw a strong rebound, and the market sentiment was lively. Trading volume was far greater than last weekend, with 2,100,000 yuan in the morning session and over 3,700,000 yuan in the afternoon session, totaling 5,825,000 yuan. Among them, salt tax bonds accounted for about 1,500,000 yuan, 1931 Customs bonds and consolidated tax bonds each accounted for 800,000 to 900,000 yuan, disbandment bonds, 1929 Customs bonds, and Relief bonds each accounted for 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, and other bonds remained relatively stable. As for the trend of various bond prices, there was a sudden and peculiar change, with a very sharp increase compared to previous days. However, there has been no major development in the overall environment of the bond market. Although the domestic and international situation seems better, there has been no obvious progress. The biggest reason is that those with a long-term vision in the market believe that the future is quite promising, thus making huge investments and aggressively buying in. The attitude of major players is no longer as indifferent as before. This is why bond prices have been rising recently, with demand constantly exceeding supply. Yesterday's continued firm trend was also due to this. It was observed that various prices rose steadily in each trading session, resulting in an increase of 80 to 145 cents compared to the previous day. The market situation was particularly good for a time.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Continues to Firm</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Fung Company, on Saturday (the 5th) the New York stock market saw little fluctuation due to the upcoming election and the lack of interest in trading among major players. Cargo volume suddenly decreased by over 20,000 tons, leading to slight selling, but prices soon rebounded. However, trading was unusually slow, and the upward trend was gradual. Most sellers were members, with very few outsiders participating. The half-day turnover was only 300,000 shares. From October 22nd to October 29th, the total cargo volume for the entire week was 1,607,642 tons, a decrease of 24,531 tons compared to the previous week. It is predicted that there will be no major changes in stock prices before the election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price  Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks  62.41  Up 0.88</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks  26.91  Down 0.48</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks  27.10  Down 0.20</p>
<p>40 Bonds   78.30  Down 0.13</p>
<h3>The Rising Trend in the Yarn and Cotton Market is Becoming Increasingly Clear</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market has become firmer, with a rising trend gradually emerging. This is due to the continuous rise in American cotton prices, which has slightly boosted market sentiment. At the same time, actual demand has improved somewhat, but large-scale transactions have not yet become active. Merchants from Guangdong are still purchasing in Shanghai, which has strengthened the market. However, buyers remain cautious, and inflationary expectations are not strong. If current sales can continue, the market is expected to rise.</p>
<p>The people's standard is rising strongly by one or two yuan. At the opening of the morning session, due to the rise in American cotton prices, there were fewer sellers in the market, and the atmosphere became tight. Prices for each month rose by one, two, three, four, or five cents. In the afternoon, prices for each month remained flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 29,800 piculs. It was observed that Lichang sold 800 bales, Yichang 750 bales, Hengchang 950 bales, and Yiyu 500 bales. Jifeng bought 1,005 bales, Changfeng 1,550 bales, and Xincheng 1,150 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Price Change  Inventory  111461 Up 12  38,350</p>

<p>January 1452 12 112,050 Total 300,500</p>
<p>Current Yarn Consumption is Relatively Improved. Current yarn sales are relatively smooth. It was observed that the total number of bales purchased by various merchants throughout the day was 1,120. Prices rose by five to seven and a half cents. The purchase amounts of each party are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 505 Jiangxi 5 Datong 10 Ningbo 10 Fujian 20</p>
<p>Nanjing 15 Luzhou 15 Sichuan 125 Mainland 25 Shantou 70</p>
<p>Yunnan 200 Xiamen 15 Anqing 10 Wenzhou 5</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Surging</h3>
<p>The cotton market has suddenly surged, and the situation is firm. This is due to the continuous rise in American cotton prices, which has boosted market sentiment. Most small investors have slightly covered their positions, but a certain manufacturer still has no intention of covering their short positions and remains calm. Business in the spot cotton market has slightly improved, but the prices offered by various factories remain low. The future situation will still depend on the fluctuations in American cotton prices.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard is rising strongly by six or seven cents. At the opening of the morning session, due to the rise in American cotton prices, there was a shortage of sellers in the market, and small short positions were covered, making the situation quite firm. Prices for each month rose by five or six cents. In the afternoon, prices remained flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 91,900 piculs. It was observed that Suilong sold 3,200 piculs, Yifeng 4,700 piculs, Huachang 2,700 piculs, Changhe 1,800 piculs, and Yuanda 2,400 piculs. Jifeng bought 5,000 piculs, Mingde 3,700 piculs, Gengfeng 4,400 piculs, Yuanxing 4,300 piculs, and Yicheng 2,000 piculs. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Weekly Bombay Cotton Industry Report</h3>
<p>The market situation last week was initially active due to the efforts of Japanese merchants to purchase cotton. However, the hedging sales by Liverpool merchants offset this activity. The supply of Indian cotton was not large, and current prices made it difficult for sellers to dispose of their goods. However, as the price difference between India and other countries narrowed, export transactions were greatly hindered, and trade with Japan was also severely affected. European demand for Indian cotton was minimal. The harvest situation was generally satisfactory. There were rumors of black mold in the Gandhi cotton and Pila cotton varieties, but their development progressed as well as last year. The statistics for the past week are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1931 1932</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts since September 1st 94 182</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 421 500</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports since September 1st 196 182</p>
<p>Exports to Europe 45 60</p>
<p>Exports to China 69 |</p>
<p>Exports to Japan 69 120</p>
<p>Other Regions 13 3</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market in Hexia Drops Another 30 to 40 Cents</h3>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, there were 50 to 60 boats from various merchants. Transactions in this street were even more sluggish. Goods from Suzhou, Tongzhou, Pingwang, Lili, Shengze, and other central regions fell by about 40 cents. Liuwen, white rice, and wild rice also fell by 22 cents. The Changli Northern Japonica market saw no gains or losses. The total opening volume in Pujiang was 600 to 700 stones.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, there were about 40 boats from mainland merchants. City and township shops were not doing well. Kunshan and Danyang rice opened lower by 30 cents. Yaozhong merchants had no interest, and prices shortened by 20 cents. Yangdujian and Bianyin yuan arrived and sold in a flat shape, and the situation loosened.</p>
<h3>Hunan Indica Arrives Yesterday</h3>
<p>｜Northern Merchants Still Interested｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the foreign rice market was dull for both local and out-of-town merchants. There were no transactions in the consolidated market. Importers, seeing the falling prices of Hexia rice, intended to wait and see before making further purchases. Sellers were very firm, and the market remained unchanged. Hunan rice en route had arrived, totaling about 2,000 bags. However, merchants from Fuzhou showed less interest and were observing the situation. Merchants from the North suddenly became interested and purchased 756 bags of newly arrived Hunan machine-oiled rice at prices of 9.30 to 9.20 yuan, and 106 bags of machine yuan rice at a price of 10.10 yuan. Market prices were similar to the previous session, but due to arrivals exceeding sales, the situation was not as active as last week.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Suddenly Soar Yesterday</h3>
<p>｜Short Covering and Major Factories Buying In｜</p>
<p>Prices for foreign wheat were only one dime. At the opening of the session, prices for the current month were weak, but market sentiment for December was good, and prices rose by one cent, causing prices to rise steadily in subsequent sessions. Short covering was particularly urgent for a time. Major factories were said to be buying in to maintain flour prices, but smaller factories were still selling. Due to the cheap market prices, non-industry customers also bought a lot, so prices for each month rose steadily. When the afternoon session opened, major factories were said to be buying in regardless of delivery date, so the market situation for each month was boosted again, even better than the morning session. As for the price of foreign wheat, it was heard that British and American firms were quoting 3.248 yuan, while Japanese merchants were only quoting 3.245 yuan. Although there were rumors that foreign wheat would be subject to import duties, this was a matter of human intervention, and the low global prices should be viewed separately. As a result, the price for the current month rose by 1.5 cents compared to the previous week, the price for December rose by 3.75 cents, the price for January rose by 3.25 cents, the price for February rose by 2.25 cents, the price for March rose by 2 cents, and the price for April rose by 1.75 cents.</p>
<h3>Forward Wheat Rebounds Strongly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the forward wheat market showed a consistent firm upward trend for each month in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The price of foreign wheat rebounded by one dime, and sellers in the market naturally disappeared. Moreover, because the attitude of major factories was unpredictable, speculators became hesitant. The number of chips this year was actually not many, and it was easy to rise if a few people pushed up the price. It was rumored that merchants from Guangdong intended to speculate, and all sessions saw buying in, resulting in a rapid rebound in near and far futures. However, this situation was purely a temporary relationship between supply and demand, and the future cannot be based on this. As a result, the price for the current month remained unchanged, the prices for December and January each rose by four cents compared to the previous week, the price for March rose by five cents, and the price for April rose by six cents.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Another 40,000+ Bags of Dutch Sugar Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw slow sales and remained weak. The exchange set the price for No. 24 donation sand white high-quality RA mark at 14.95 yuan, and the price for ordinary goods in the initial session was 14.875 yuan, which later became 88.5 yuan, down 2.5 cents from the previous day. Prices for medium sand white, Dutch red, and other varieties remained flat, with no price fluctuations. The price for early cotton Dutch white goods was 15.5 yuan for full cotton high-quality goods, and 15.2 yuan for semi-dry and semi-wet goods that arrived later. The market remained stable. The Ziba Hai round imported another 40,000+ bags of Dutch sugar yesterday, including 11,040 bags of cotton Dutch white sugar, 11,135 bags of coarse sand white sugar, 1,975 bags of green sugar, and 16,366 bags of Dutch red sugar. Local factories opened a few dozen bags of cotton white sugar at a price of 13.75 yuan. The Wufu white sugar of Dayong was slightly opened at a price of 10.07 yuan per picul.</p>
<h3>The Longan Business of Gui Yuanhang in Zhabei Falls</h3>
<p>Recently, as longan arrivals continued and sales became scarce, the market situation weakened. In particular, the stock of small and medium-sized longans was even larger, and the business also fell. In order to cater to consumer demand, various firms have lowered the market prices of various grades of screened longans, with top-grade Jiyuan and Jijiyuan each falling by two yuan, Tianhong falling by one yuan, and Chu Ban falling by five cents.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Wuxi Double Cocoons Continue to be Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>｜Yesterday, 320 Dan Were Transported by Shanghai-Wuxi Freight Train｜</p>
<p>Since resuming work, the silk factory has seen a daily increase in the production of raw silk, silk cocoons, and by-products. Therefore, the shipment of raw silk and other goods to Shanghai is not uncommon. Yesterday, a Shanghai-Wuxi freight train transported another 320 dan of double cocoons to Shanghai, where they were unloaded and prepared for processing.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Market is Slightly Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign tea market was quiet due to the horse racing by Western merchants. British firms only had half-day transactions. Only Baitou, Zhuang Ruichang, Yulong and other places, and China Tea Company, purchased Zhenmei, Zhenmei, Emei, Gongxi, Xiamei and other goods, totaling 460 boxes. Market prices did not fluctuate much. However, according to general news, sources in Yantong claimed that tea sales in the Moroccan market have gradually started to move. It is expected that the market will be active after the Western merchants' autumn races.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Pieces of Western Suits and Flannel Were Traded</h3>
<p>Western suits, top pieces and flannels, have recently seen a large appetite from Western clothing tailors. Due to the gradually cooling weather, actual sales are in demand. The current order business of door-front stores has increased sharply. In particular, the newly popular Hanling Peng Sportex four-bubble Dex GofteX Kauff's Dex Sprioghon and other three types of Western suits and top-pieces flannels, which have a good shape and are selling well. Seaside Western Clothing Shops all have considerable orders, and their trend is better than other wool fabrics.</p>
<h3>Coal: Shanxi Coal Continues to Rise by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of Shanxi white coal rose by five cents per ton, so the current selling price must be 15.75 yuan per ton. Red Qi white coal and Mark white coal were therefore also raised by 2.5 cents.</p>

<p>Quotations of Ma Xiangbo, a 93-Year-Old</p>
<h3>Response Regarding Quotations</h3>
<p>Leshan Hall recently received a letter from Macau, which stated: | (To Elder Xiangbo. Respectfully, I have admired your quotations in Shen Bao for some time. Your rich experience, clear understanding of worldly affairs, and sophisticated knowledge of human relationships are indeed extraordinary for an elder. | Yesterday, I read a sentence in your quotations, "(Only sincerity lasts forever)," which I would like to match. I, with my humble skills, have composed a matching sentence. I wonder if there is anything worth considering? If my trivial skill is unsuitable, it does not matter. I hope you will correct it, which would be my pleasure. | Respectfully, your servant, Lin Andeng.</p>
<p>Four sentences are extracted: 1. "Filial piety should be admired for a thousand years"; 2. "The great path cannot be abandoned for a moment"; 3. "Do not leave behind a thousand years of regret for a misstep"; 4. "Never forget to show kindness at any moment." The rest have been deleted. After reading this letter, Elder Xiang said: "(It would be best to collect Wang Xizhi's posthumous works and use the original sentences to match. I once tried to compose the sentence (Who mourns that fleeting scenes all return to nothingness) to match (Only sincerity lasts forever). Why not publish the original text and let the public ponder it?)</p>
<p>In this case, I have no choice but to spend half a day copying Mr. Yu Youren's calligraphy to share with the public and wait for the next public announcement. |</p>
<h3>Eulogy to Civil War启沃</h3>
<p>For the sake of preserving peace in East Asia and maintaining world peace, Chinese soldiers would rather endure a bellyful of anger and internal strife than rashly provoke an international war. Even losing thousands of miles of territory is of no concern. This "sacrificing everything for the greater good" attitude and dedication to peace can only be found in Chinese soldiers. Nobel Peace Prize, is it in China? Is it in China?</p>
<p>Having experienced disaster and banditry, the common people are in a miserable state, barely human. They cannot find work, and they are starving but not dying. Since they are useless in this world, it would be better to wipe them out with a single cannon blast. The battlefield is full of stray dogs, saving the cost of coffins, which would save a sum of money. Moreover, according to eugenics, these lower-class people should not be bred as much as important people, as it affects the nation's physical health. Failing to eliminate them early will lead to regret.</p>
<p>The noble meaning of civil war is thus and so!</p>
<h3>Gaotai Ge Fair in Northern Cixi</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>| Entertainment without forgetting to save the country?</p>
<p>Of course. When Beiping holds the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly to pray for national peace, then the countryside | Cixi North Township Shanbei | holding the Gaotai Ge fair is also a way to pray for national peace. Shanbei in Northern Cixi is located by the sea and backed by mountains. The customs are strong. Since the early Qing Dynasty, there has been a tradition of welcoming gods and holding fairs every year in the third month of the lunar calendar. Some say that the Ming Dynasty was destroyed by the Manchus, and the survivors were deeply resentful. They used the fair to imply revolution. The god they welcome is said to be the East Peak Emperor, but in reality, it is Emperor Huaizong of the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, the fair in the third month is to commemorate the day of Emperor Huaizong's martyrdom. | In Eastern Zhejiang, every family inserts willow branches on Qingming Festival, which also means summoning souls. Also, during Thanksgiving, paper horses of (All Saints of the Southern Dynasty) are offered. The people of Ningbo like to chant the Sun Sutra and devoutly believe in Zhu Tian Bodhisattva. All are good evidence of anti-Qing and restoration of the Ming. | Although Lu You's poem says: Once home, I invite the women of the western neighbors, to watch the god fair on the bridge tomorrow.) Fairs were already popular in the Song Dynasty, but our fairs in Eastern Zhejiang have a special meaning.</p>
<p>This Gaotai Ge fair in Northern Cixi has not been held for twenty-nine years. The fair is nothing rare. The banners and ceremonial guards are not very characteristic compared to the Jiangwan fair. However, the Gaotai Ge is as high as thirty-three feet and is carried by seventy-two people. | Twenty-four people are in a group, and they take turns carrying it. | The stage does not use children dressed as theatrical figures but is strung together by adults. It is said that each Gaotai Ge costs as much as ten thousand foreign dollars. The entire fair is divided into fourteen communities, and each community is funded by the people of each fort. There are a total of fourteen Gaotai Ge, and the expenses are already considerable. Moreover, the places where the Gaotai Ge passes, although not encountering mountains to open mountains and encountering rivers to build bridges, must demolish obstacles such as eaves and towers without resistance. The roads should be temporarily built by the people of each fort, about two feet wide, and filled very smoothly. I think, why is the Gaotai Ge unique in the Shanbei fair? Perhaps there is a special history. There is a small city in Shanbei called (Guanhaiwei), which was built during the Ming Dynasty to defend against Japanese pirates. Because it is located near the sea, Japanese pirates often came to harass it. This Gaotai Ge may have been used to scout Japanese pirates, and the fair was a practice of military preparations for the people. Otherwise, although other fairs have Gaotai Ge, why are they not thirty-three feet high?</p>
<p>On the 5th, 6th, and 7th of this month, the Gaotai Ge fair will be held in Northern Cixi. There will be crowds of people and a lively atmosphere! If the friends who watch the fair remember the story of resisting Japanese pirates, practice military affairs while farming, then they can be said to be (entertaining without forgetting to save the country). | This fair was originally prohibited by the county magistrate, but later, a powerful person supported it, and the county sent troops to protect it. It is heard that the first community is called (Zhongshan Association), and the god they carry is of course Mr. Zhongshan.</p>

<h3>Old and Faded Pearls Are Worthless</h3>

<p>| How should young people be? |</p>
<p>The happiest golden age of life is before the age of ten! However, I should declare in advance that what is recorded now is for people of the same stage as me. Others with (super) or (special) abilities are, of course, not included in this example.</p>
<p>After you pass your tenth anniversary, this is the first major turning point in life. Before, you were at home or at school. Your parents or teachers probably always thought you were too young and did not restrain you very much. But after you turn ten, your parents or teachers will urge you even more. Indeed, in these years, there must be adequate preparations for entering school or business. This is the foundation. If the foundation is not solid, even if the grand building on top is beautifully built, it will eventually collapse.</p>

<p>Young people over the age of twenty are in an era of striving. However, it is also an era of depravity! You see, most of those who serve in companies, firms, and other institutions are young people in their twenties. Take another look, and those who are lost in the world of sensual pleasures, dogs, and horses are also mostly young people in their twenties! I think that at this time, it is when you are spreading your branches and leaves. You should not let them run wild but restrain them. You will see that the lush trees will become withered branches. Isn't this too regrettable? I think that if you hold on to a fixed purpose and do not blindly follow others, then you can gradually reach a stable path. XX XX XX</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of Death (8)</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>3.  Abandoning a Lagging One</p>
<p>Is it that revolution shouldn't forget love? Or that changing love shouldn't forget revolution? Or that both revolution and love are needed? The simple-minded Young Master Han Muliang has already forgotten. In short, since he arrived in the capital, he saw at Xuanwu Lake, by the Qinhuai River, on Qingliang Mountain, beside Yuhuatai, and all other places where one could climb and gaze, there was always a man and a woman, very intimately talking and laughing together, coming and going, sitting and standing. A woman with permed hair and dancing socks, leaning on the side of a man in military uniform with a soft leather whip, made him feel that the air of revolution was filled with love, and the tide of love stirred up revolution.</p>
<p>What made him even more unable to avoid jealousy, and from jealousy to hate, were the frequent banquets.</p>
<p>He remembered, on the eighth day of taking office at the XX Department, many colleagues held a welcome dinner at the Anle Restaurant. In one room, two tables were set, men and women mixed together, their laughter and the scent of perfume filling the air, harmonizing the dry flattery, fawning, enumeration, exaggeration, boasting, envy, and various different methods of (blowing) and (patting). Mrs. Feng, the section chief, speaking in crisp Beijing dialect about the old capital's miniature golf, was more pleasant to listen to than Mei Lanfang's opera. Mrs. Li, the section chief, liked to gamble and was most experienced with the Shanghai greyhound races, and her authentic Shanghai dialect was not annoying either. What attracted the most attention from the whole room was the dancing skills of Comrade Chang Shanfen, a clerk. Foxtrots, waltzes... she used her slender hand, adorned with a four-carat diamond ring, to simulate the steps on the edge of the round table instead of her jade feet in high heels, and even moved her head from side to side, lightly humming a marching tune in her mouth, so that even the stably placed artificial ivory chopsticks almost wanted to dance with her.</p>
<p>In the end, the men were plain and crude, only able to praise the greatness of "Secrets of the Imperial Palace," the poetic nature of Hu Die's two dimples, that the Western food at Mercier's was not as good as at the Lexiang Restaurant, that the Nanjing cheongsams were too short, and that Suzhou was too calm. These words almost made the tartar jump out of their ears. Don't listen to them, let's appreciate the women's faces and makeup instead. That one with a few strands of hair at the hairline is quite charming. That one's rouge on her lips is too thick, she doesn't even dare to eat much food. It's better to be like the one at that table, who only draws fine eyebrows, applies Paris dry powder, and doesn't (dot rouge on her lips), which is more generous and natural.</p>

<p>The Anhui Provincial Association of All Anhui Tea Industries in Shanghai, the Xiuxihui Wuyuan Tea Industry Association, and all Tea Merchants jointly received an order from the Ministry instructing the Anhui Finance Department not to set up checkpoints along the river to collect original business tax, and to handle the case where Cao Yan and other tax guarantors in Xiuxihui did not comply with the Ministry's order and dispatched troops to set up checkpoints along the river to collect taxes and additionally levy tea tax. A telegram was sent appealing. The text of the telegram is recorded below: Respectfully addressed to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Supervisory Yuan, Hankou Military Affairs Committee, Chairman Chiang, and the Kuomintang and Political Affairs Supervisory Committee: We have carefully examined the Business Tax Law, which has already been promulgated and implemented. Article 4 stipulates that the business tax rate shall be levied at a rate of four to twenty per thousand of the business capital amount. Article 9 states that the business tax shall be paid directly by the taxpayer to the collection agency, and shall not be contracted or handled by others. The laws and decrees are brilliant, and financial authorities and business people should abide by them together. However, the Anhui Finance Department, in the spring of this year, under the name of special business, contracted the business tax of tea in She and Xiu counties to merchants Chen Changde, Shi Yuyu, Cao Zai, and Wang Xuehua. Chen Changde and others recognized the package rules of 28,080 yuan and set up checkpoints along the river at Huizhou, Tunxi, Shendu Street, and other places to collect taxes according to the original tea tax method. At that time, merchants knew that the matter was illegal, but they endured it silently because the tax rate had not increased. Unexpectedly, the tax contractors Chen Changde and others still harbored evil intentions, and they presented to the Anhui Finance Department and the Special Business Tax Bureau for approval to collect according to the tea capital tax rate of seventy per thousand in the 19th year, actually restoring the likin, and dispatched troops to coerce merchant Liu Shuzhi, who was forced to drown in the river and died. Merchants were sad and indignant, and unable to bear the oppression, they began to appeal to the Ministry and provinces. In mid-June, they received an order from the Ministry of Finance to levy taxes at a rate of five to twenty per thousand. Chen Changde and others then agreed to temporarily collect at a tax rate of twenty per thousand, and the remaining excessive amount was recorded in the account books using a registration method to temporarily avoid payment. From May to August of this year, until the date of suspension, in addition to the approximately 50,000 yuan that had been collected that did not exceed the tax rate of twenty per thousand, more than 10,000 yuan of illegal taxes had been collected, which was not a small amount. If the contractor Chen Changde and others can submit the legally collected tax amount, they will already have a surplus. However, the merchants concealed it and did not release it, and the Director of the Finance Department, Hua Yuanlong, for some unknown reason, did not pursue the tax contractors, but instead pursued the illegal taxes that the tea merchants had registered but not paid. He successively appointed special commissioners to guard and demand payment, ordering the She County Tea Industry Association to complete the payment on its behalf. Because this illegal tax amount had not been collected and there were no funds to pay, the tea merchants had no choice but to file an administrative appeal with the Anhui Provincial Government according to legal procedures. However, the provincial government delayed handling it, and the Finance Department did not wait for the provincial government's decision, nor did it stop the punishment. Committee member Zhang Siqing and others urged the She County Government to seal up the property of the chairman of the She County Tea Industry Association, threatening to auction it off to pay off the debt, acting swiftly and vigorously, as if dealing with bandits. It is truly unknown what crime the chairman of the tea merchants has committed, and that the official authorities should use force to such an extreme. If this tea likin of seventy per thousand is truly legal, then the merchants, even if they lose their homes and livelihoods, would not have the slightest complaint. Or if this money has already been deposited with the association, with most of the fellow merchants being nearby in the same village, how can the chairman of the tea merchants alone conceal it? Ye Yuanlong, the director of finance of a province, cannot pretend to be unaware of the National Government's order to abolish likin and the financial and criminal laws and regulations. He clearly knows that the abolition of likin concerns national credibility, but he brazenly levies a tea likin in disguise of seventy per thousand. He clearly knows that merchants have no obligation to pay illegal taxes, but he brazenly pursues them and seals up the property of innocent merchants. He shelters those who contract taxes for personal gain and exploit merchants, fearing that he is not doing enough, and he abuses law-abiding and tax-paying good merchants, fearing that he is not being cruel enough. The country still has laws and regulations, and the laws have not yet failed. What responsibility should Ye Yuanlong bear? The people of Huizhou have always been known for their simplicity and willingness to help others. Unless they are driven to the point of unbearable suffering, they would not dare to lightly trouble the authorities. We hereby truthfully state the facts, hoping that you will secretly send a high-ranking official to Anhui to thoroughly investigate and order the cessation of the illegal punishment of pursuing taxes and sealing property in order to maintain the rule of law and save the people's lives. We are filled with trepidation as we await your orders.

<h3>Citywide Martial Law Yesterday for Communist Party Anniversary</h3>
<p>▲···········▲</p>
<p>Slight Disturbances in the Concession</p>
<p>Peace in the Chinese Area</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet government. The Communist Party organizations in this city had secretly plotted activities. The authorities in the Chinese and concession areas had received early reports and taken unusually thorough precautions. Therefore, the Nanshi and French Concession areas were as quiet as usual. However, there were slight disturbances in the International Settlement. The situation in various places yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>International Settlement</p>
<p>At about 11 am yesterday, between Beijing Road, Zhifu Road, and the Northern Mud City Bridge, near the Sino-French Pharmacy, two men dressed in blue cloth shirts and pants, resembling workers, stood at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhifu Road, holding red flags and firecrackers. There were more than a hundred people resembling workers and students on both sides of the road cheering them on. The workers holding the flags waved them to direct the crowd, shouting slogans and setting off firecrackers, followed by applause. As a result, nearby residents and businesses were slightly frightened. The patrol officers at that location immediately blew their whistles and rushed into the crowd to make arrests. Nearby patrol officers also arrived after receiving the information. They arrested one person each resembling a student and a worker. The others had already scattered and fled. The police car from the Laoza Gate Police Station also arrived and took the two people to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<p>French Concession</p>
<p>Yesterday, patrol officers in the French Concession wore helmets and patrolled back and forth. At the iron gates where the Chinese and French concessions met, more patrol officers were stationed to maintain strict vigilance. As a result, only in the quiet areas of the western section were red reactionary leaflets and various slogans discovered. No disturbances occurred.</p>
<p>Zhabei</p>
<p>After receiving orders to prepare for defense, the Fourth and Fifth Districts of Zhabei cooperated with the Municipal Security Team to maintain vigilance. They paid particular attention to pedestrians. In the evening, they implemented a factory curfew, and all public entertainment venues were ordered to close to avoid mixing with the crowd. In addition to the armed police stationed in the North Railway Station area, the Municipal Security Team also stationed double guards at various key points. The defenses at the intersection of Baoshan Road and the Chinese and concession areas were particularly strict. In addition, there was a patrol team patrolling back and forth, so the order was quiet, and no incidents occurred. Only reactionary slogans were found on the electric poles or walls in secluded places. When the patrol team discovered them, they immediately tore them down and reported them to the district office.</p>
<p>Pudong</p>
<p>The police and militia organizations in Pudong received orders from their superiors in advance to step up precautions yesterday to prevent Communist Party disruptions and other incidents. Zhang, the district chief of the Third District, and Xu, the head of the militia, each dispatched armed police and militiamen to patrol and inspect various important crossings starting at 6 am. The defenses were particularly strict in the evening. At the same time, detectives Zhang Yong and Yang Jinsen led all the detectives to check pedestrians at various key intersections. Throughout the day, the area was peaceful as usual. Only the patrol team of the Third District discovered six or seven small red Communist Party flags and several leaflets on the electric poles on New Market Road. The district reported them to the General Bureau for inspection and verification.</p>
<h3>Drastic Drop in Rice Prices; Various Parties Seek Relief</h3>
<p>Silver and Money Industries Jointly Raise 3 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letters to Various Places Seeking Circulation</p>
<p>This year, due to the abundant harvest of grains in the country, rice prices have drastically fallen, endangering the farmers' economy. The central authorities convened a food meeting to discuss relief measures. Jiangsu Province and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai specially organized food adjustment associations to seek solutions. After two meetings, it has been decided to set up rural public warehouses in various places to facilitate farmers' loans and mortgages. The authorities in this city are also actively implementing plans formulated by the Social Affairs Bureau. At the same time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also telegraphed the Fujian and Guangdong Chambers of Commerce to investigate the food situation in order to find ways to circulate it.</p>
<p>Planning Warehouse Funds</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu-Shanghai Food Adjustment Association held a joint meeting last Friday with representatives from Jiangsu Province and decided to establish rural public warehouses, it participated in a meeting of the Shanghai Local Association of Silver and Money Industries last Saturday to discuss funding and loan methods. As a result, it was decided to jointly raise 3 million yuan, with the Shanghai Banking Association undertaking 1 million yuan, the Money Industry Association undertaking 1 million yuan, and banks that are not members of the Banking Association sharing 1 million yuan. The lending institutions will be handled by the local branches of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and major banks. If there are no branches established, they will be handled by neighboring branches. The warehouses will be jointly organized by fair merchants and branches of the Bank of China in various places. The association also considered that the areas with the most rice production in Jiangsu Province include the 22 districts of Suzhou, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi, and that the Jiangnan area is traditionally wealthy and easier to manage, so it was decided to start there first. In the Jiangbei area, due to various inconveniences such as transportation and financial institutions, other methods will be needed.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letters to Various Places</p>
<p>In addition to participating in the Jiangsu-Shanghai Food Adjustment Association to actively promote food adjustment and relief of the farmers' economy, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the fundamental solution is to promote circulation. Therefore, yesterday, it specially sent letters to the Chambers of Commerce in Guangzhou, Shantou, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Tianjin, and other places, requesting them to investigate the local food situation in order to find ways to circulate it and assist in the adjustment.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Plans Storage</p>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city is also paying close attention to the sharp drop in grain prices. In addition to the Food Committee originally established by the Social Affairs Bureau to specialize in adjusting rice prices, it has now requested the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior to pay attention to the import of foreign rice and to find ways to transship it for sale. According to Secretary-General Yu Hongjun yesterday, the Municipal Government intends to establish a large-scale grain storage warehouse to relieve the farmers' economy. The Social Affairs Bureau has been actively planning this, and it will be implemented soon. The content of the plan is roughly divided into three points: (1) The warehouse fund will be separated from the municipal finances and dedicated to handling this matter. (2) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and financial and rice industry groups will cooperate. (3) Loans or mortgages will be completely aimed at benefiting farmers.</p>
<h3>Chen Jiliang Inspects Various Ships at Songkou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to go to Xiangshan Ocean to inspect tomorrow morning</p>
<p>Commander Chen Jiliang of the First Fleet has been ordered by the Ministry to inspect the navy and various naval affiliated agencies in the Yangtze River and coastal areas. The first to be inspected were the garrison warships in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The inspection in the Hankou area has been completed long ago, and the inspection in the Nanjing area was completed on the 4th. Commander Chen immediately took the flagship Hai Chou and arrived in Tongzhou at 8 am on the 5th to inspect the Jiao Ri Survey Ship. At 10 am, the inspection was completed. He still took the original ship and sailed straight to Shanghai, arriving at Wusongkou to anchor in the evening. The inspection of the ships stationed at Sanjiashui in Songkou was originally scheduled for the 6th, but the wind in Songkou was very strong that day, and all the ships sailed to Wusong Town to temporarily anchor and avoid the wind. Therefore, the inspection was temporarily postponed. Yesterday, the wind weakened slightly, and the ships temporarily anchored in Wusong to avoid the wind sailed back to Sanjiashui to be inspected. The inspection was not completed until the evening. The ships inspected yesterday included the Jiankang and Hu ships, two torpedo boats, and the Qingtian and Jiangzhen Survey Ships. Commander Chen has scheduled to take the flagship Hai Chou to the waters of Xiangshan in Ningbo tomorrow morning to inspect the Ganlu and Jingxing ships, and then transfer to Xiamen, Fujian, and other places for inspection. After the inspections in Fujian and Xiamen are completed, he will return to Shanghai to inspect the land-based agencies affiliated with the Fujian Naval Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Association Holds Banquet Last Night for Professor Martin</h3>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Martin Return to the United States this Morning</p>
<p>Professor Martin, Director of the Journalism Department of the University of Missouri, USA,</p>
<p>was hired by the Journalism Department of Yenching University in Beiping to serve as a visiting professor for one year. He is scheduled to return to the United States this morning. The Shanghai Newspaper Association specially hosted a banquet at Xinghualou last night to bid farewell to Mr. and Mrs. Martin and their son. Those invited to attend from the press included Shi Liangcai, Qian Bohan, Ma Yinliang, and Gu Angruo from Shen Bao; Wang Boqi and Wang Cuwei from Xinwen Bao; Wang Yingbin and Xiong Shaohao from Shishi Xinbao; Huang Bohui and Cai Hangsu from Shibao; Chen Hanming from North China Daily News; Dong Xian Guang from China Press; Powell from China Weekly Review; Mr. and Mrs. Harris from the United Press; Mr. and Mrs. King from the New York Times; Huang Xianzhao, Director of the Journalism Department of Yenching University; and Wu Dao, Professor of Journalism at St. John's University. During the banquet, Chairman Shi Liangcai delivered a welcome speech, stating that Mr. Martin, Mrs. Martin, distinguished guests, and colleagues, today, the Chinese press in Shanghai welcomes Mr. Martin, Dean of the Journalism School of the University of Missouri, and his wife. My colleagues consider Mr. Martin a scholar with mathematical knowledge of journalism. He has taught at the University of Missouri for many years and inspired the younger generation. His contribution is very great. Moreover, because he is an exchange professor with the Journalism School of Yenching University, he came to our country to preside over the Journalism School of Yenching University. Thus, the foundation of the Journalism School of Yenching University, which is still in its initial stages, is becoming more and more solid. It is truly beneficial to the future of journalism and culture in our country. It is a great honor for my colleagues to jointly welcome this famous professor and scholar today. Professor Martin then delivered a response, stating that he had visited China three times before. The courteous and amiable spirit of the Chinese people is well known throughout the world. He has personally experienced it and cannot forget it. He has not made any contribution to the Chinese press. However, he feels that the future of Chinese newspapers will have unprecedented development. His only suggestion tonight is that Chinese newspapers become a major undertaking for public education, analyzing and criticizing current events to enlighten the public. The future of the new China depends on the promotion of newspapers. He hopes they will work hard.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Commercial Association Boy Scout Memorial Monument for Sacrificing for the Country</h3>
<p>Inauguration Ceremony to be Held Soon</p>
<p>Letter Requesting a Decision on the Memorial Day</p>
<p>The Boy Scout Corps of the Municipal Commercial Association has established a monument for the members who died for the country in the Battle of Shanghai, including four martyrs such as member Wei Yunxiang. The new Jinji Construction Factory has undertaken the construction as a semi-voluntary service. Now it is completed and the memorial service and inauguration ceremony will be held soon. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Erection of a Memorial</p>
<p>The monument is located in front of the council hall of the Municipal Commercial Association, about eight feet in circumference and about two feet high. It is surrounded by iron railings and topped with the Boy Scout emblem. It faces northeast. The front is engraved with the four large characters "Sacrifice for the Country" inscribed by General Cai Tingkai of the 19th Route Army. A white stone inscription is embedded on the side, written by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Commercial Association. The text reads: "On January 28th of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Japanese army attacked Zhabei unsuccessfully and then divided into land, sea, and air forces to attack Shanghai. In order to save refugees and wounded soldiers, this association dispatched Boy Scouts to form rescue teams and set out to rescue them. Members Luo Yunxiang, Mao Zhengxiang, Ying Wenda, and Bao Tingwu, who were non-combatants, were killed by the enemy. This is unheard of in international law. Funds were raised to support their families, and the general circumstances of the four martyrs' deaths were recorded on a stele beside the court of this association to show their loyalty and commend them. Alas, the spirit of Xianzhen has not returned, and the talk of the Hu cavalry grazing south is still rampant. Those who come later, strive for it. The time is the September 18th National Humiliation Memorial Day of the 21st year, and the names of the martyrs are Luo Yunxiang, age 21, from Shantou, Guangdong; Ying Wenda, age 21, from Fenghua, Zhejiang; Mao Zhengxiang, age 19, from Shanghai, Jiangsu; Bao Tingwu, age 18, from Yinxian, Zhejiang."</p>
<p>Selecting a Memorial Day</p>
<p>The Municipal Commercial Association sent a letter to the Preparatory Committee of the China Boy Scout Association, stating that the members of the corps reported that the four martyrs' memorial tower will be completed soon, and that the memorial service should be held as soon as possible. On the 28th of last month, a plan for the memorial of martyrs was drafted and submitted to the Preparatory Office of the China Boy Scout Association in Nanjing and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the China Boy Scout Association for adoption. In addition to the Shanghai Municipal Council, which has agreed to submit it to the meeting for discussion, the original letter and plan are copied and submitted to your association for review. It is proposed to request your permission to urge the Preparatory Office of the China Boy Scout Association to quickly decide on the memorial and commemoration methods, so that the memorial service for the four martyrs can be held as soon as possible. This has been discussed and resolved by the 17th Standing Committee meeting, and a letter has been sent to your association requesting you to quickly review and handle the case. Accordingly, the case is recorded and submitted, hoping that you will investigate and reply to it.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Convenes Representatives from Various Industries to Discuss Donating Funds to Aid Northeast Refugees</h3>
<p>Ten Articles Outlining Donation Methods</p>
<p>Each Industry Association to Establish Fundraising Teams</p>
<p>The Northeast Refugee Relief Association, jointly initiated by all executive and supervisory committee members of the City Chamber of Commerce and prominent figures from all sectors, has already been formally established. Currently, fundraising efforts are underway with great intensity. Recently, the fifth executive and supervisory meeting of the City Chamber of Commerce resolved ten articles outlining donation methods for various industries in Shanghai to aid Northeast refugees. These have been circulated to each industry trade association for compliance. To clarify the purpose of donations to all merchants and residents in the city and to awaken national consciousness, Mr. Luo Qinghua, a committee member and director of the Commerce Department of the Chamber, has been convening representatives from various industries for discussions since the second of this month.</p>
<p>Industries summoned for discussions included shipping, sugar, paper, cotton cloth, yarn, rice, construction, silk, Chinese soap, and 173 other trade associations. Mr. Luo passionately described the plight of the compatriots in the Northeast, who have fallen under the iron heel of the brutal Japanese but are fighting valiantly at the risk of their lives, all to defend the dignity of the Chinese nation and to serve as the last shield for their compatriots in the interior. He argued that if sufficient assistance is not provided, the people of the Northeast will inevitably perish under the merciless slaughter of the Japanese due to lack of support. This would not only mean the loss of land with no hope of recovery, but also that the enemy would surely move their brutal forces to sweep across the Southeast. The pain of national subjugation would be far greater than the Yangzhou Massacre. He pointed out that everyone has a wife and children and a home, and to avoid being slaughtered by the enemy, they should quickly aid the righteous people of the Northeast. Everyone has a heart of compassion, and aiding the righteous people of the Northeast is a supreme act of charity. While it is undeniable that Shanghai's commerce is depressed, he said, the difference between the suffering of our compatriots in the Northeast and our own is like heaven and earth. That we can still live in relative peace and engage in commerce today is all thanks to the struggles and sacrifices of the righteous people of the Northeast. If we truly wish to delay our demise even for a moment, we must generously open our purses and aid the righteous people of the Northeast who are fighting for the nation's survival. Mr. Luo’s earnest explanation and instructions on fundraising methods moved all the industry representatives, who agreed to establish fundraising teams within their respective industries within five days and to subscribe to monthly donations. They each received donation registers and dispersed. It is now known that the association has established a donation affairs unit office within the Commerce Department, assigning Sun Mingqi, Yuan Hongjun, Li Ruzhang, Zhang Yousheng, Xue Jianxin, and others to serve concurrently as staff members. The sugar and other trade associations have also confirmed their monthly donations and have directly remitted them to the designated bank. The donation methods agreed upon at the meeting, as well as the preface to the donation register, are recorded below:</p>
<p>Donation Methods: 1. The purpose of this donation is to aid Northeast refugees and awaken national consciousness. 2. Donation methods are divided into the following three categories: (A) Percentage of store sales, (B) Percentage of employee salaries, (C) Free donation. 3. For percentage of store sales, the minimum donation standard is one-thousandth of daily sales revenue. 4. For percentage of employee salaries, the minimum donation standard is five-thousandths of monthly salary income. 5. Donors may determine the percentage methods themselves. Those who voluntarily increase the standard amount will be appropriately rewarded by the Northeast Refugee Relief Association. 6. For free donations, the Northeast Refugee Relief Association will create donation registers to be distributed by various industry fundraising teams. 7. Donation payment methods will follow the regulations of the Northeast Refugee Relief Association. 8. The above donations will be collected by the Shanghai Northeast Refugee Relief Association and remitted to the Peiping Relief Association, to be managed and distributed under the auspices of General Zhu Ziqiao, with reports from the said association. 9. To facilitate donation coordination with various industries, the Northeast Refugee Relief Association has established a donation affairs unit office at the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce. 10. These methods will be implemented upon approval by the executive and supervisory committee of the City Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Preface to the Donation Register: On January 28th of this year, the Japanese army attacked Zhabei, and the 19th Route Army rose to resist, wiping away long-standing resentment in one fell swoop. Women sold their hairpins to support the troops, and merchants and industrialists carried baskets of food to comfort them. In just a month, donations reached over ten million yuan, a display of popular sentiment unprecedented in ancient times. Cunning schemers, thinking to take advantage, eventually retreated under oath. Can it not be said that this was the effect of cooperation between the people and the military? What, then, of the Northeast? The border commanders played games with the enemy, the central authorities were cautious, and the valiant soldiers were all withdrawn into the interior. Those who swore not to coexist with the invaders under the same sky were either common people from the fields or battle-scarred veterans who endured hunger and thirst, risking their lives in the borderlands. Their heroism is no less than that of the 19th Route Army, and the hardships they face are ten times greater. They may be called refugees, but they may also be called righteous soldiers. In terms of their circumstances, these righteous soldiers have already experienced the pain of national subjugation and refuse to be treated as subjugated people. Calling them refugees is a description of their reality. Our association's initiative to provide relief is not merely to provide sustenance for the refugees, but to enable them, with their remaining strength, to complete the task of rebuilding the Northeast. The situation of the three northeastern provinces in China is like the head to a person. Without the head, the person cannot preserve his life. Therefore, the loss of the three northeastern provinces means the loss of China. This has already become an unbreakable law. Saving money and scrimping today to rescue the refugees of the three northeastern provinces is to preserve our own future lives. Japan's invasion of Shanghai was not aimed at annexing territory, but specifically at implementing economic aggression. However, we fought to the death, and our assets and homes were reduced to ashes, but we did not care. This is how the men of spirit should be. The three northeastern provinces have already become a place that Japan is determined to seize. The seriousness of this is probably a hundred times greater than the situation in Shanghai. To save our compatriots in the three northeastern provinces, we should at least approach it with the same sacrifice. Perhaps there will be a day when the Qin Dynasty is reborn and the ashes are rekindled. I have summarized the main points briefly to inform the people of the nation. Written on October 10th, the 21st year of the Republic of China, by Wang Xiaolai, Director of the Donation Affairs Unit of the Shanghai Northeast Refugee Relief Association, and Deputy Directors Luo Qinghua and Yan Fang, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan to Review Rejuvenation Public Bond Regulations</h3>
<p>City Government to Send Representatives to Capital at That Time</p>
<p>To Attend Legislative Yuan Meeting for Explanation</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the City’s Rejuvenation Public Bonds, for which the City Government had previously drafted public bond regulations and a principal and interest repayment schedule and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review, have been approved by the Executive Yuan and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Legislative Yuan has scheduled a meeting this Wednesday to discuss the matter. The City Government has instructed the Finance Bureau to send representatives to the capital at that time to explain everything. Once the Legislative Yuan completes its review, the Executive Yuan can instruct the City Government to comply. It is also reported that the total amount of these public bonds is six million yuan, with a discounted actual receipt of four million eight hundred thousand yuan according to the public bond regulations. However, the Rejuvenation Plan for this year drafted by the City Government requires a total of six million yuan, leaving a shortfall of one million two hundred thousand yuan after deducting the proceeds from the public bonds. The Finance Bureau will need to find other ways to raise this amount. According to Secretary-General Yu of the City Government, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, there have been many parties who have come to discuss subscribing to the bonds since the announcement of the public bonds. Foreigners have also expressed a willingness to invest. The City Government is open to both domestic and foreign investors, but will operate within the scope of the proposed regulations and will conduct detailed research to select the most favorable offers before making a decision. Therefore, no announcement can be made at this time. As for the use of the public bonds, in terms of relief, they will be used to provide loans for the construction of housing for the common people. This matter will be handled by the City Bank. In terms of construction, they will be used to establish public hospitals, public libraries, and main roads in the city.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Inspects Construction Projects in the City Center</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 6th (previous day), Mayor Wu of this city went to the Jiangwan city center to inspect the construction progress.

They first inspected the Municipal First Public Cemetery, followed by the new City Government building, the police station building of the Public Security Bureau, and the road engineering management office in the city center. They also inspected the road and city center public sports field construction projects within the area of the first land reclamation project. The Director of the Public Works Bureau, Shen Yi, reported on the progress of the projects at each location. They returned by car at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee to Hold Finance Committee Meeting Next Week</h3>
<p>To Discuss Loan for Yuehan Railway</p>
<p>Regarding the Ministry of Railways borrowing funds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee to complete the Yuehan Railway, the Board of Directors previously resolved to hand the matter over to the Finance Committee of the Committee for discussion of detailed plans, and nominated two directors, Ye Gongchuo and Donner, to participate in the discussion. According to Mr. Donner, a director of the Committee, who spoke to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency yesterday, the Committee will hold a meeting next week to discuss this case. The amount is 2.15 million British pounds. A small section of the railway from Nanzhen River (Shaoguan) to Lechang has already been completed with government funding. The remaining section from Lechang to Zhuzhou will be completed with this loan. (New Sound News Agency)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Stipulates Priority Delivery of Aviation Telegrams</h3>
<p>Fees Still Charged at Regular Telegram Rates</p>
<p>China's aviation industry has been developing rapidly in recent years, with applications becoming more widespread. Facilities for flight safety are urgently needed. Items such as weather forecasts for various locations, preparations for airport landings, and requests for assistance in the event of an accident all require rapid transmission. Recently, to enhance aviation safety, the Ministry of Communications has designated a special type of aviation safety report that will be delivered with priority over other telegrams to ensure speed. The reporting fee will still be charged at regular telegram rates. However, the content of the telegrams is limited to the following essential matters: 1. Requests for weather reports before takeoff and replies. 2. Notification to airports to prepare for aircraft landings. 3. Requests for assistance in the event of an aircraft accident. 4. Warnings regarding aircraft precautions. 5. Reporting the aircraft's takeoff time (the number of passengers and cargo may also be included). 6. Other urgent matters concerning aviation safety. The telegrams must not contain unrelated matters or vague and non-urgent phrases. Otherwise, the sending telegraph office may handle the telegram as a regular telegram. The Ministry of Communications issued instructions to all telegraph offices and wireless stations yesterday to comply with these regulations for aviation safety telegrams.</p>
<h3>Central Mint to Begin Minting Next Spring</h3>
<p>Remarks by Deputy Director Wang Lai-Zhi</p>
<p>After the implementation of the "abolish taels, adopt dollars" system, the Central Mint decided to start minting new dollars to meet the demand. The opening plan and other matters have already been decided. It only remains to wait for the order from the Ministry of Finance before recruiting workers and starting everything. As for the official opening of minting, it has not yet been decided. According to Deputy Director Tu Xiaolai, speaking to reporters, it is likely that minting will begin in the spring of next year. Because the first issue to decide is the silver dollar fineness, this point has not yet been set by the Ministry of Finance, so work can not be started this year.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Bandit Suppression in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Published by the First Army Group Communication Office in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the First Army Group Communication Office in Shanghai published the latest news yesterday regarding the suppression of bandits by the army. Currently, they received a telegram from Chief of Staff Miao Peinan reporting the bandit suppression situation in Guangdong Province as follows: 1. The Xiaobei River area on the Guangdong border has rugged terrain, with many mountains and steep ridges, often serving as a haven for bandits and communists to flee to. For the past two or three months, under the supervision of Li Hanhun, Director of Pacification of the North River, troops have been actively suppressing them, gradually clearing the area. The pacification work is now 80% complete, with only a small remnant of bandits, about 200 people, fleeing into the Yao Mountains. Director Li continues to send troops to encircle and suppress them. Once this group is cleared, the pacification work can be considered complete. 2. Remote counties in Qiongya also occasionally have bandits and communists gathering. When the troops come, the bandits leave; when the bandits leave, the troops come. After Chen Zhang’s army earnestly searched and suppressed the area, there was also great progress. It can be completely cleared this year. 3. Yu Hanmou of the Guangdong First Army has been very effective in clearing and suppressing the Red bandits in the Yingqian area of Jiangxi Province. The long-standing bandit troubles in Sannan have almost been completely eliminated. Zhang Meixin's division has now dispatched a team to capture Shizi Xu, which belongs to Anyuan County, and continues to advance towards Xiaowei. However, there are many blockhouses in the area, making it difficult to attack. Artillery has now been added to suppress the bandit traces. It can be reported that it will be completely cleared soon.</p>

<p>Zhang Chunchun of the Jiali Pawnshop Advocates Donations</p>
<p>Zhang Chunchun, the manager of the Jiali Pawnshop on the Bund, moved by the team's enthusiasm and patriotism, and because the team's operations are hampered by financial difficulties, initiated a donation drive among his colleagues at the pawnshop, as well as relatives and friends. He collected 300 yuan and sent it to the Northeast Volunteer Army Rescue Team yesterday with a letter. After receiving the funds, the team immediately used 100 yuan to purchase medicines to be sent to the front lines, remitted 150 yuan to the team headquarters in Peiping through the Shanghai Bank, and kept the remainder for later use. The letter and the names of the donors are recorded below to alert the nation and to commend them: The letter reads: Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have brothers? Yet the righteous soldiers of the Northeast resolutely use their flesh and blood to fight against the fierce artillery fire of the invaders, without any thought of turning back. They are alert to the pain of national subjugation and do not want to see the great land of China sink. However, in the mournful winds outside the Great Wall, the patriots sacrifice their lives, shedding their blood and throwing their heads. But we, in this gentle land, are silent and indifferent, as if we have heard nothing. Alas! We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, but we cannot shoulder the burden of resisting the enemy together. We are already deeply ashamed! How can we begrudge our material and spiritual assistance? Now, the patriotic elements in Shanghai, seeing the deaths and injuries of the righteous soldiers and the lack of medical care, have organized the Righteous Soldiers Rescue Team. The first batch has already arrived in Peiping, and the second batch is actively preparing to depart. However, the long journey makes it difficult to succeed without sufficient financial resources. Therefore, we are asking for assistance from all sectors. I am moved and my blood is boiling. I dare to advocate for this cause, even though my strength is like that of an ant. It is a matter of saving the country, and there is no room for refusal. Saving the country is like saving oneself. Why don't you generously contribute to this cause? Respectfully written by Zhang Chunchun on November 7th, the 21st year of the Republic of China. Chen Yunwan 100 yuan, Zhang Chunchun 100 yuan, Zhang Shicong 6 yuan, Tao Deguang 10 yuan, Zhang Shizheng 30 yuan, Zhang Haizhong 5 yuan, Zhang Qingchao 1 yuan, Gu Zutong 10 yuan, Gu Qingji 6 yuan, Zhang Pinchang 2 yuan, Wang Jianguo 1 yuan, Shen Hanwen 6 yuan, Zhang Jiansong 5 yuan, Zhang Gengsong 4 yuan, Zhang Muyan 1 yuan, Zhang Junchao 4 yuan, Zhang Shulin 1 yuan, Zhang Zhenkun 5 yuan, Ren Shijie 3 yuan, totaling 300 yuan.</p>

<h3>US Wheat Loan to be Signed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Flour Industry Expresses Intent to Use US Wheat</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, although various sectors are making every effort to request a halt to the second continuation of the US wheat loan to the value of 11 million US dollars from the US Financial Rehabilitation Corporation to the Ministry of Finance, according to reliable sources in the financial and flour industries, the details of the second continuation of the loan have been successfully negotiated and cannot be stopped. In the coming days, representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the US Financial Rehabilitation Corporation stationed in Shanghai will officially sign the agreement and discuss the method of shipping in batches to China. As for how the shipment of US wheat to China will affect the economy of domestic farmers, it is said that domestically produced wheat is generally difficult to convert into flour. Flour companies have always used US wheat, but because it is currently harvest season for domestic agricultural products and the quantity is too large, it is inevitable that it will conflict with reality.</p>
<h3>The National Products Exhibition's Examination of Exhibits is Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>Now Relocated to the Xiaodongmen Exhibition Hall for Operations</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of the Shanghai National Products Exhibition, a review committee was promptly organized to meticulously examine the products from various factories, carefully evaluate their grades, and award certificates to provide encouragement. It has been learned that the review process is mostly complete, and the examined goods have been returned to their original factories. Only a portion of the products, due to their more complex manufacturing, require chemical testing and research during the review, thus taking more time. It is expected that this will also be completed in the coming days. After all reviews are finished, the review committee will mark the grades on the goods and report to the National Products Exhibition, so that the grades can be entered on the certificates. After the mayor and director of the Social Affairs Bureau have affixed their seals, the certificates will be issued to the manufacturers on a scheduled date. Yesterday, Mr. Cao, who is handling matters for the National Products Exhibition, told reporters that the date of the awards and whether a ceremony will be held during the awards are yet to be determined, because the association’s finances are very tight and this expense is completely outside of the budget. Additionally, the equipment and items displayed in the exhibition hall have all been moved to the Xiaodongmen National Products Exhibition Hall yesterday. At the same time, its branch office at the "Penglai Market" will also be moved to the exhibition hall today. All unfinished matters will continue to be handled on the fifth floor of the hall.</p>
<h3>Shandong Province's Soybean Oil Transported to Shanghai: Customs Temporarily Allows Tax-Secured Release</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Regarding letter No. 210, which opened with a letter from the Cereal and Oil Cake Industry Association stating that oil products transported from Shandong Province are taxed as foreign goods, creating an unbearable burden, please forward to the business tax department a request to reduce taxes on the large batch of soybean oil imported by the Chengdu, Hexing, and Lianxing steamboats on the 14th. Pending approval from the Ministry, please allow the tax-secured release of goods or temporary suspension of penalties, etc. Upon investigation, this office previously received a similar petition from the said association, which was forwarded to the customs for review. Subsequently, the Tax Affairs Department replied, stating that if the amount of the security exceeds the tax due, it can be accepted, while awaiting the government's decision. Apart from informing the relevant merchants by customs valuation and assessment, this reply is being forwarded for your information."</p>
<h3>Two Aviation Organizations to Merge</h3>
<p>Each Nominates Three Representatives;</p>

Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city also convened a discussion with members of both aviation organizations at the Municipal Government at 4 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Aviation Construction Association</h3>
<p>Two More Experts to be Sent to the U.S.</p>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Construction Association held its 17th standing committee meeting at the office of the Renlu Commercial Market yesterday. Yin Zhiling, Yan Zhifang, Weng Zhaoyuan (represented by Lin Jiyong), Huang Mengsheng, Xiong Xiling (represented by Zhu Lin), and Tan Bozhi attended, with Ling Xianyang as an observer. Lin Jiyong was elected as chairman. First, Yin Zhiling reported on the preparations for General Weng Zhaoyuan to represent the association on a promotional tour overseas, stating briefly that experts and staff members Luo Yintuan and Lin Junneng would accompany Representative Weng to Nanyang. More experts were needed to go to the Americas to assist with everything. It was resolved to send Lin and Ling Xianyang as commissioners of the association to the Americas to arrange everything and assist Representative Weng in promoting aviation. Second, regarding the solicitation of membership in North China, currently chaired by Standing Directors Wei Qinglan and Xiong Xiling of the association, the question of whether to send personnel to assist was raised. It was resolved to send Zhu Lin to assist Directors Zhu and Xiong in their work, and to report on Representative Weng's overseas plan and to liaise on other matters. Third, the Chinese National Aviation Salvation Association preparatory committee sent a letter nominating Wang Zhengting, Wang Xiaolai, and Lin Kanghou as representatives to discuss cooperation with the association. It was resolved to file for reference.</p>
<h3>Li Guojie Returns to Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Guojie, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was summoned to Wuhan by telegram by Chairman Chiang and inspected shipping on the Yangtze River. From Wuhan he went to Nanjing, met with the new Minister of Communications, Zhu Jiahua, and suggested plans to reorganise the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. He returned to Shanghai yesterday. As for the resignation of Director Chen Fumu, he has been preparing for a few days to finalize and hand over affairs.</p>
<h3>Upstream Yangtze Waterway Fees Increase</h3>
<p>Fees Increase by Half Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>Local steamship companies recently received a telegram from Hankou, stating that due to the daily decrease in the Yangtze River's water level from Hankou to Hunan, the passage of ships has become difficult. Yesterday, five companies, including China Merchants, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, and the Three Northern Companies (excluding Nisshin Kisen Kaisha), each sent representatives and agreed to increase cargo fares for the shallow upstream section. The public resolution was made that, starting tomorrow (the 9th), the shallow water freight rate will increase by 50% from Hankou to Changsha, Hunan. Cargo shipped from Shanghai to Hunan will have the fee collected in Shanghai. All passengers have been notified.</p>
<h3>Andong Port is Frozen</h3>
<p>The weather has been getting colder recently, and Andong Port in Northeast China is frozen, making navigation difficult. Local Chinese and foreign steamship companies received a telegram from Andong yesterday, stating that the port river there would begin to freeze on the 12th of this month. Except for ships departing from Shanghai to the Northeast before the 12th, it will be impossible to sail into the ports of An-Ying after the deadline. Therefore, local steamship companies have decided to suspend all Andong routes starting from the 12th, and resume them only after the ice thaws next April.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy Returns Home This Morning</h3>
<p>Yanagihara and Araki Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Japanese Minister to China Akira Ariyoshi purchased two first-class cabins, number two, on the Nagasaki Maru from the NYK Line yesterday, and is scheduled to board the ship at the Wayside Wharf with his wife and secretary Okazaki at 9 a.m. this morning to return to Japan.</p>
<p>In order to increase the handling of negotiations at the Japanese Consulate in Nanjing, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dispatched Foreign Ministry official Yanagihara Keiichi to China, ordering him to assist with everything in Nanjing. Yanagihara arrived in Shanghai by boat yesterday with his wife and is scheduled to go to Nanjing today to take up his duties at the consulate.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a large trading port with many Japanese ships entering and leaving, and there are many maritime disputes. Japan has specially dispatched a maritime affairs officer to Shanghai, with Araki Shigeo taking office. Araki had returned to Japan for a long time due to personal matters, and only returned to Shanghai yesterday to resume his original post as maritime affairs officer.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Abuse of Power Incident: Robert Fforde Appropriately Applied for Leave and Left Shanghai</h3>
<p>Affairs are Handled by Deputy Tax Commissioner Grio Lee.</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that over one hundred trade associations in this city jointly requested the Ministry of Finance to severely punish customs officials, for reasons including the Jianghai Customs’s auctioning of confiscated white sugar, improperly allowing merchants to alter labeled prices on confiscated sugar, withholding the tax-paid bills of lading of Guangyuan Sugar Firm, and misinterpreting the regulations for boats traveling between Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai, thereby detaining civilian boats traveling to Hebei. According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Mr. Robert Fforde, the Customs Commissioner, applied for leave to return to his home country from July 12th of this year, and did not return to his post until October 9th. Previously, there was a notice published in the newspaper stating that during Mr. Robert’s leave, all affairs would be handled by Deputy Tax Commissioner Grio Lee. Mr. Robert has now made some explanations regarding this situation to avoid misunderstandings. His statement reads that someone in the General Affairs Section of Jianghai Customs improperly allowed merchants to change the labels and auction off confiscated white sugar, withheld Guangyuan Sugar’s tax-paid bills of lading, and misinterpreted the regulations for boats traveling between Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai to detain civilian boats, etc. The improper handling of these matters was long ago criticized by a group of merchants. However, Commissioner Robert Fforde has been out of Shanghai and back in his home country since July 12th, and only returned to his post on October 9th, which was stated in a notice published in newspapers. It is said that Mr. Robert has always been committed to promoting good relations with merchants, and intended to correct the misconduct of the person in question. Therefore, as long as merchants' opinions and representations do not violate established regulations, he has always tried to accommodate their wishes. The joint petition from over one hundred trade associations in this city mistakenly included Mr. Robert's name, which should be corrected.</p>
<h3>Question of Redrawing Boundary in Southern Shanghai</h3>
<p>Qin Xitian expresses his opinion</p>
<p>Recently, Qin Xitian, a resident of Chenxing Township, Shanghai County, expressed his views on the redrawing of boundaries between Shanghai and Nanhui Counties, stating: "The Xinnanhui Daily, issue number 243, contains a report that the County Government convened a joint conference of four counties to discuss boundary issues, including a petition from the Nanhui County Magistrate to take jurisdiction over Chenxing Township, which belongs to Shanghai County. Whether Chenxing Township belongs to Shanghai or Nanhui, both belonging to Jiangsu Province of the Republic of China, is not worth discussing. However, any change in administrative divisions should be based on the convenience of the local people as the premise. Chenxing Township is about eighty li east to the seat of Nanhui County, and about twelve or thirteen li west to the new seat of Shanghai County in Beiqiao. Which is more convenient is self-evident. However, I recall that in the first and second years of the Republic, gentry and citizens of Nanhui County, such as Zhu Zihao, proposed dividing the districts and townships of Nanhui County, and combining Sanlin and Chenxing Townships of Shanghai County, to establish another county, with the county seat in Zhoupu Town, to be named Puzuo County. This was approved by Chenxing Township. At that time, Qin Liangchen of Luhui, Pan Shiruo of Xinchang, and Du Shenzhi of Duxing all strongly supported the idea. Although the matter was not completed, the idea had already deeply penetrated the minds of the people. If the previous proposal could be implemented, it would not only conform to the wishes of the people of Chenxing Township, but also to the wishes of the people in the western half of Nanhui County. As for the case of the late Qing Dynasty Governor-General Cheng Dequan, who奏准劃并斗入表内, [T/N: Unable to translate] including the banks of the Central River in Nanhui County to Shanghai County, in 1928 the Shanghai Special Municipality and the Jiangsu Provincial Government agreed that Chenxing Township of Shanghai County and part of Zhoupu City of Nanhui County would be incorporated into the municipal area, with the takeover temporarily postponed. These two cases have not been canceled and may take effect at any time, which should not be ignored."</p>

<h3>Japanese Goods Flood In to This City</h3>
<p>Japanese Cloth Exceeds British Goods</p>
<p>In the past two days, the Asama Maru and Mikasa Maru ships arrived, carrying a total of more than 12,500 pieces of Japanese goods. Apart from cloth and hardware, there were various miscellaneous goods, such as milk, medicines, cosmetics, leather goods, electrical materials, match raw materials, and other luxury items. These were not large quantities of goods. This further proves the recovery of their trade in China and the success of their dumping policy. According to Japanese business statistics, the amount of Japanese cloth shipped to China last month exceeded British cloth by more than 50,000 pieces, accounting for one-third of the total, amounting to more than 165,400 pieces. Japanese businesses are becoming increasingly optimistic about this.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Merchant Ships Suspend Sailings to Northeast China</h3>
<p>Lack of Cargo Leads to Business Decline</p>
<p>No Cargo to Load after the Blockade</p>
<p>Since the puppet regime announced that import duties and tonnage taxes would be collected starting September 25th at Andong, Yingkou, and 口(illegible) [T/N: Likely Dalian], all Chinese goods shipped there have been subject to an import tax of 3%, and staples such as soybeans and soybean oil exported from those ports have also been subject to export taxes. After China announced the blockade of the Northeast Customs, Shanghai customers stopped shipping goods to these ports. In addition, the financial freeze has virtually cut off trade. Also, the South China ports now source their soybean oil and other products from the Yangtze River and Haizhou, which are less expensive and avoid double taxation. Therefore, cargo transport between Andong and Shanghai has also been cut off.</p>
<p>British Merchant Ships Reduce Sailings and Change Routes</p>
<p>Since the 918 Incident, the number of ships sailing to the Northeast from Shanghai has gradually decreased. The Huashang Yu Da Steamship Company has been monitored by the puppet regime. Ships such as Zhaoxing and Haichang have also reduced their sailings, carrying only coal. However, Butterfield &amp; Swire, a British company, had specialized ships sailing the Andong-Shanghai route. After the previous ship, the Zhou Shan, sank after hitting a reef, the Chengdu was reassigned to the route. Now, since there is no cargo going to and from Anhui and Shanghai, and it must pay tonnage taxes, the ship has been reassigned to the South China route.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nisshin Kisen Kaisha Company Plans to Restart the Yangtze River Liner Service</h3>
<p>Waive Passenger Fees to Attract Customers</p>
<p>But the Result is Still Few Passengers</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that since the 918 Incident, the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, a Japanese company, has suffered greatly from the boycott by the Chinese public, affecting its business. Since the January 28 Incident, it has suspended the Yangtze River liner services. Although it has repeatedly tried to restore the services by every means possible, it has had no effect.</p>
<p>Suspended Due to Boycott</p>
<p>The head office of the company is in Japan, and Shanghai is a branch office. Its business is mainly the Yangtze River routes, with nine ships, including the Luoyang, Fengyang, Nanyang, Yueyang, Ruiyang, Xiangyang, Dazhen, Dafu, and Dali, specializing in sailing up and down the Yangtze River; two ships, the Huashan and Tangshan, on the North China route; and two ships, the Lushan and Songshan, on the South China route. Due to the boycott by the Chinese public, it completely suspended the Yangtze River liner services since the January 28 Incident. It tried to maintain services on the South China and North China routes, but suffered huge losses each time. It then resumed services with three ships on the Yangtze River route: the Fengyang, Nanyang, and Xiangyang. The remaining ships were docked at the Huangpu River and various docks along the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Ineffective Plans</p>
<p>Since the suspension of services, the sailors on the Yangtze River ships have become unemployed. For patriotic reasons, they are willing to sacrifice. Although three ships, including the Nanyang Maru, have resumed services on the Yangtze River, there are few Chinese passengers and cargo on each sailing. Only Japanese transit goods come to China. Each sailing incurs huge losses. All the Chinese workers in the middle-class cabins had to be temporarily reassigned to other jobs. Although the president of the company came to China and made repeated plans to restore services, such as lowering fares, providing armed protection, and making special publicity, sparing no expense, and preparing to fully restore the services on August 1st, the national sentiment of the Chinese people remained strong, making it impossible to implement the plans.</p>
<p>Waive Passenger Fees</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reporters learned yesterday from sources in the shipping industry that the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha has been making every effort to plan and try to restore business. Its latest plan, which has now been implemented, is to waive passenger fees. Passenger fees and freight fees have always been contracted by compradors, who collect the ship tickets (i.e., passenger fees) and freight fees to cover the ship's expenses. For example, the ship ticket from Shanghai to Hankou is 6.5 yuan, but now passengers are charged 2, 3, or 4 yuan, depending on the passenger. Once there is a slight improvement, three ships, the Luoyang, Yueyang, and Ruiyang, will be restored first. Although the poor Chinese passengers are happy to board, there are still only a few passengers and cargo on each sailing. The cargo is still only Japanese transit goods. Therefore, it is still difficult to truly restore services.</p>
<h3>Lu Dipin Cables Luan Wenzhao</h3>
<p>To Treat Illness in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Lu Dipin, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, who is obese, recently suffered a stroke. Medical treatment did not cure the illness. He cabled Yan Fuqing, President of the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society in Shanghai, inviting Dr. Luan Wenzhao, Director of Internal Medicine at the hospital, to Hangzhou for treatment. After receiving the cable, President Yan asked Dr. Luan to take the 3:45 PM train to Hangzhou yesterday to provide treatment.</p>
<h3>Banking Community Revises Business Regulations</h3>
<p>Organize Specialized Committee to Study</p>
<p>The banking community in this city believes that the banking business regulations currently in use have been in place for quite some time, and many aspects are no longer suited to recent trends. It is proposed to revise them. The banking community has instructed experts from various banks to organize a specialized committee to discuss the progress of this matter. According to Mr. Lin Kanghou of the Bankers' Association, the revision of the banking business regulations is currently being studied by the specialized committee. In the near future, there may be concrete measures to implement.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Adds a Remittance Bureau</h3>
<p>The Central Bank initially had two institutions: the Issuance Bureau and the Business Bureau, specializing in the issuance of banknotes and business transactions. Now, the Ministry of Finance, to improve the convenience of remittances, has specially established a Remittance Bureau to handle domestic and foreign remittances nationwide. It is now organized and formally established.</p>
<h3>Can Executive Committee Members of Two Trade Associations Hold Concurrent Positions?</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Consults the Ministry for Clarification Based on the Situation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a request from the Silk and Satin Trade Association to clarify whether a member representative of a trade association who has already taken office as an executive committee member of Industry A can be elected as an executive committee member of Industry B, has submitted the request to the Social Affairs Bureau, which has submitted it to the Municipal Government to consult the Ministry of Industry for clarification. It is reported that the Municipal Government has submitted the request to the Ministry of Industry for clarification based on the situation. The consult is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of consultation, according to the Social Affairs Bureau, it states, "According to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, it states, "According to the Silk and Satin Trade Association, it states, "Upon investigation, if a member representative of each trade association has already taken office as an executive committee member of Industry A, whether they can be elected as an executive committee member of Industry B, our association has no basis for this question and requests instructions and explanations to provide compliance." According to Article 7 of the Association's Rules, it states, "A member representative of the Association shall not represent more than two commercial legal entities or stores." According to its provisions, although it seems to be specifically for restricting store members, the intention of this provision at the time was to prevent the monopolization and manipulation of member representatives. Therefore, the draft rules of the Association at the time stated that one person could represent two places, but only had one vote and one right to be elected. Subsequently, the provision was revised by your bureau as above, so limiting the concurrent positions of store member representatives should also limit the concurrent positions of trade association member representatives. The reason why it was not clearly stated in the articles was for a general overview, using one example to illustrate the rest. Therefore, in fact, if one person represents two trade associations to join the Chamber of Commerce, it will be rejected by your bureau. If one person is elected as an executive committee member of Industry A and then elected as an executive committee member of Industry B, it seems that one person may represent two trade associations to join the Chamber of Commerce and should be restricted. This is one argument. Another argument is that a person representing two trade associations should be restricted from joining the Chamber of Commerce because they may monopolize and manipulate the situation. As for the executive committee member of Industry A and the executive committee member of Industry B, they are completely two positions, and there is no suspicion of manipulation. Also, their talents or reputation may be needed by both industries. Therefore, they should only be restricted from joining the Chamber of Commerce as an executive committee member of Industry A, and the election of the executive committee member of Industry B should not be restricted. This is another argument. Judging by the merits of the matter, the latter argument seems more reasonable. How should the matter be handled? It is requested that you review and approve and instruct the Ministry of Industry for review and instructions to facilitate compliance." According to this, please review and approve the request and forward it to the Ministry of Industry for review and instructions so that we can comply. This consults the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<h3>Anhui Northern Relief Dispute</h3>
<p>Quan Shaowu Cables Xu Shiying for Negotiations</p>
<p>Quan Shaowu, the Anhui Northern Relief Commissioner, was previously accused of selling relief grain, and Quan was listed as the first defendant. This dispute is currently being heard by the court and has not yet ended. Yesterday, Quan cabled Xu Shiying, stating that Xu should not listen to only one side and make a second accusation. Quan made contact with Xu in Qiupu, Anhui. His cable said, "Xu Jinglao, Anhui Qiupu National Government Flood Relief Committee Member, respected sir, Quan Shaowu initially believed that the Anhui Northern Relief dispute was due to the dissatisfaction of a few individuals with Shaowu and fabricating rumors and attacks. I have personally reported the situation to the Shanghai Committee, which investigated and gave instructions, believing that the accusations were intentional slander and damage to reputation. You have long been an important member of the National Government Flood Relief Committee and cannot claim to be unaware of the truth of the Anhui Northern Relief dispute. However, it was only yesterday that I read in the Shanghai newspapers that you had accused Shaowu in the Shanghai First Special District Court based on previously recognized slanderous facts. The reversal of right and wrong is unprecedented. Moreover, the accusations even involved foreign members of the Anhui Northern Relief, Ms. Zhou Shi and Mr. Dyke, which surprised and saddened Shaowu. When the 共匪 disturbed Anhui, you consulted with Shaowu about allocating funds for relief. Because the official relief had no funds, you asked for assistance from the Yi relief. After Shaowu returned to Bengbu, he consulted with the foreign members in charge of the Yi relief, and the Yi relief funds were allocated for relief. You then telegraphed your recognition of this righteous act. The source of the Yi relief belonged to the Joint Committee, and Mr. Dyke was the accountant of the committee, and Ms. Zhou Shi was an important staff member of the committee. I did not expect you to recognize the benefit in the beginning, and then accuse the foreign members of intercepting the relief funds. This strange argument, if it came from the mouths of ignorant local tyrants, would be forgivable. However, it came from a senior official of the National Government like you, which would affect the source of relief funds and leave the worst impression internationally. It is now widely spread in society that Xu Shiying, a senior official of the National Government, has accused Quan Shaowu of misappropriation, and many believe the accusations to be true. Shaowu's reputation has been completely destroyed. For the sake of maintaining the future of relief efforts and Shaowu's personal reputation, both publicly and privately, I will definitely deal with you legally. Quan Shaowu."</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Exhibition Closes Yesterday</h3>

<p>Yesterday was the last day of the Chrysanthemum Exhibition at the Donggou Municipal Garden. The crowds were very dense. Groups included the Private Wumu Primary School, Gaoqiao Jiqun Hospital, Municipal Yancang Primary School, Pei Zhao Primary School, Zhendong Primary School, Renji Primary School, Wusong Fisheries School, and personnel from various agencies.

<h3>New Infectious Disease Ward at Shanghai Hospital Completed</h3>
<p>Open to Patients Starting on the 10th</p>
<p>The Public Shanghai Hospital at Santei Wharf, Duojia Road in Nanshi, is the earliest public hospital established in this city. Over the years, it has treated internal and external diseases with notable success, particularly in the field of infectious diseases, where it has a strong reputation. Since 1924, the hospital board hired Dr. Zhou Chuliang, who studied infectious diseases in Germany under Dr. Friedrich Mummert, to manage the hospital. Since then, he has made many contributions to the field. Several years ago, Dr. Zhou further invited Dr. Sha Yunwu, who studied infectious diseases at Jikei University Hospital in Japan, to assist in diagnosis. The number of patients seeking treatment has increased significantly. Recognizing infectious diseases as an important public health issue in Shanghai and the scarcity of hospitals admitting such patients, the hospital board raised funds last year to construct a new building. Designed by engineer Xu Jintang and built by Xieji Construction Company, the facility is well-equipped, featuring not only patient rooms but also nurse stations, sterilization rooms, food preparation rooms, bathrooms, changing rooms, and toilets. It was completed at the end of last month. Recently, board member Yao Xinzhi, along with construction expert Zhang Xiaoliang, inspected and accepted the building. It is reported that the ward will begin admitting patients on the 10th of this month.</p>

<h3>Sheng Family Nephews' Inheritance Dispute to be Judged</h3>
<p>The case of Sheng Ze Cheng and others being sued by their nephews Shao Yunpeng and others for forging the will of their maternal grandmother, Sheng Zhuangshi, and seizing property has been repeatedly heard in court. The judge has urged both parties to reconcile, but recently, reconciliation proved impossible. Upon the plaintiff's request, subpoenas were issued again, ordering witnesses Li Pucheng and Shen Yiqing to appear in court for questioning. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing was held. Both sides, accompanied by lawyers, arrived at the Second Tribunal of the First Special District Court successively. Of the summoned witnesses, only Shen Yiqing appeared. Judge Shen Bingrong took the bench, first questioning Shen Yiqing about the circumstances of writing the will on behalf of the deceased Sheng Zhuangshi. Subsequently, the defendant Sheng Zecheng stated that after the death of his mother, Zhuang Tai Furen, a will was found while sorting through her belongings. Following her wishes, 10,000 yuan was allocated from the estate and sent to the plaintiff, but it was rejected. Finally, Shao Yunpeng stated his reasons for believing that the discovered will was forged by the defendants. After further debate by the lawyers from both sides, Judge Shen ordered a recess and announced that the judgment would be delivered on the morning of the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>More Reports of Fraudulent Qianzhuang Using Zhuang Piao to Defraud Goods</h3>
<p>At No. 8 Jingjiang Lane, Tianzhutang Street, French Concession, someone established the Dingyuan Qinji fraudulent qianzhuang. They issued bad zhuang piao, all dated November 6th, to defraud merchants and factories of goods and absorb money. In addition to the Jinbo workshop at No. 125 Fuyou Road and the Dachangxiang leather store inside Xinbeimen, and the Detaichang cloth store at No. 6 Dongcheng Lane, Shiliupu, which were defrauded of factory cloth worth 250 yuan, several tens of yuan, it is now known that there are dozens of households that were defrauded in this case. After the report was published in yesterday's newspaper, Li Acai of Yilun Silk Store in Xiangfen Lane, who was defrauded of silk goods worth 250 yuan, and Huachang Hardware Factory at the intersection of Yad Road in Hongkou, who was defrauded of water faucets worth 480 yuan, all obtained bad zhuang piao. Yesterday, more than a dozen households who saw the report went to the Second Branch and the First Branch of the First District, requesting an investigation. The police chiefs of the branches informed them that the case had been submitted to the General Bureau, and they should report to the General Bureau. It is also reported that the main culprit in the fraudulent zhuang piao case, Luo Bingyan, has been handed over to the General Bureau.</p>
<h3>Director Wen Stops Secret Agents</h3>
<p>Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently learned that all districts and stations were employing secret agents to assist in arrests. These secret agents lacked experience and knowledge and had not received training, causing them to frequently harass residents, leading to complaints from the local community. Their past performance was also unremarkable, so it should be strictly prohibited to safeguard public security. Yesterday, a special order was issued to all district chiefs to comply. If secret agents are being used, they should be stopped immediately. In the future, if theft cases occur, the original detectives will be responsible for handling them in conjunction with the bureau's detective team. The Inspection Department will oversee the process.</p>
<h3>Failed Robbery Followed by Threatening Letter to Extort the Victim</h3>
<p>Shang Wu, a Chinese detective of the French Concession Police, learned the other day that suspicious individuals were hiding in the Hongbin Teahouse at No. 579 Kaifeng Road. At 2:30 PM, he led detectives Zhou Yushan and Liu Shaocheng in secret to apprehend two individuals, including one Tan Qingxiang, and brought them back to the police station. Under interrogation, Tan confessed that he and Zhang Yingjie, Zhang Xiaogui, and others had repeatedly written threatening letters since the 2nd of this month, extorting 5,000 yuan from Wang Shaofu. Detectives investigated and learned that Wang operated the Guangdalong Customs Brokerage at No. 3, Lane 418, Jiangxi Road and lived at No. 123 Taoyuan Fang, North Jiangxi Road. On the morning of the 14th of last month, several robbers armed with weapons broke into Wang's house in an attempt to rob it. The incident was reported, and detectives were dispatched, who arrested the robbers. The robbers resisted arrest by firing shots, and the detectives returned fire, resulting in two robbers being killed and two being captured on the spot. The newspapers provided detailed coverage the following day. At that time, Tan Qingxiang was being treated at the Four Ming Hospital for an illness. Upon seeing the report, he thought there was an opportunity to exploit. He conspired with the two Zhangs to write threatening letters, intending to extort money. Tan was strictly questioned about the whereabouts of the two Zhangs and led the detectives to No. 2 Yuqing Lane, Zhaojia Road, Ximen, where Zhang Yingjie was apprehended, while Zhang Xiaogui was still at large. The two, Tan and Zhang, were brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang presented the case to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court, stating that since the victim Wang Shaofu had received the threatening letters but had not reported them to the police, the detectives only received three threatening letters when they investigated Guangdalong yesterday, as Wang Shaofu had gone to Hong Kong for convalescence. The letters were being sent to the General Inspectorate for handwriting analysis and had not been brought to court. The police investigation into the case was not yet complete, and Wang Shaofu had not arrived, so no formal charges had been filed, and a request was made to keep the suspects in custody. Tan and Zhang confessed to conspiring with Zhang Xiaogui, who was still at large. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the confession and ordered that they be detained for seven days for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Unlicensed Pig Slaughtering Leads to Extortion</h3>
<p>Giving Away a Pig's Head Was Not Enough</p>
<p>Daring to Gather a Crowd to Demand Two Yuan</p>
<p>Zhou Tong from Yancheng, who lived in a thatched shed at an unnumbered address on Qiwupu Road, made a living raising pigs. Because he slaughtered pigs for sale without obtaining a license from the Municipal Council, Gao Zhengqi, a Jiangbei employee of the nearby Health Department, learned of this. On the morning of the 4th of this month, around 10 AM, he secretly went to Zhou's house, claiming to be a staff member of the Municipal Council Health Department, and used this as a pretext for extortion. Fearing him, Zhou gave him a pig's head, and he left. The next day at 5 PM, he gathered a group of ruffians including Luo Decai (also from Jiangbei), and went to Zhou's place again, saying that they needed ten Yuan tou to settle the matter, otherwise they would report it to the Health Department, and Zhou would have to pay a large fine. Zhou asked his friend Xu Congjin to act as a mediator and paid two yuan, and was finally left alone. The other day, Zhou went to the Health Department to inquire and learned that Gao was actually using a false identity and impersonating an employee to extort money. He reported the situation to the Jianlin Road Police Station. The head detective sent detective Ni Baofeng to Fengshan Road, where Gao and Luo were successively apprehended, brought back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Tribunal of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the facts, saying that Gao Zhengchao claimed at the police station that the pig's head had been snatched away by hooligans and could not be taken to the Health Department to be reported, and that he did not extort two yuan from Zhou the next day. The second defendant, Luo Decai, completely denied the allegations. Therefore, he requested a postponement for further investigation. Subsequently, the victim Zhou Tongren testified to the events, and Xu Congjin testified that Gao Zhengchao had indeed taken a pig's head the first time, and the second time he came with Luo Decai, and he mediated, giving him two yuan, which was true. When questioned, Gao admitted that the plaintiff slaughtered pigs for sale without a license, so he took a pig's head.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>to the Health Department to report it, but it was snatched away by hooligans on the way. He denied going to the plaintiff the next day to take two yuan, and equivocated in his other statements. He also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Luo Decai testified that at that time, he went to the plaintiff to buy two jiao of meat, but was refused and went home, and there was no extortion. He asked for leniency. Judge Zhao Linyu reviewed the confession and ordered that he be remanded in custody for further investigation and questioning.</p>
<h3>Throat Slit and Testicles Crushed, Ni Qilang Dies a Tragic Death</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of a White Waistband</p>
<p>Leads to Suspects</p>
<p>Ni Qilang, a Chongming native residing at No. 1 Tongji Lane, Lao Xiaopi Lane, Dongjiadu, Nanshi, had no regular occupation and was a low-level loafer. The day before yesterday at 6 PM, he left home. Around 9 PM, he suddenly returned home in a rickshaw, with bloodstains and injuries on his throat and neck. He collapsed and was unable to get up, falling onto the bed. He immediately told his wife, Gong, to quickly call his younger brother, Ni Shaoqian. Seeing the situation, she rushed to call her brother-in-law, but by the time he arrived, Ni Qilang had already died. An examination of the deceased's body revealed that the wound on his throat had become mangled, with flesh and blood blurred, and his left testicle was crushed, and his kidney was also broken, and bleeding. In the deceased's hand was a white waistband, stained with blood. Based on the origin of the white waistband, she suspected that not long ago, a couple from Beisha (now Qidong County), Shen Shuchun and his wife, had been brought to Shanghai by Ni Qilang, and Shen's wife had a love affair with Ni Qilang. The Shen couple suddenly returned to their hometown on the day of Ni's death. It was learned that Shen's couple had recently suffered the loss of elders, so this white cloth waistband was likely Shen's. It was suspected that the death was caused by a love triangle leading to a violent fight. She reported the matter to the First Branch of the First District. Yesterday, they ordered Qin Defang, the local head of the 23rd Pu, to cooperate with the deceased's wife, Ni Gong, and others to report to the court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Woman Sells Daughter into Prostitution to Support Lover</h3>
<p>Prostitute Zhang from Wuxi, 46 years old, lived with her husband Ting Jinfu in their hometown, farming for a living. Two years ago, she brought her biological daughter, named Qindi, to Shanghai to work as a servant. Although she was nearly 50, she still had a strong desire for romance. Soon, she became involved with Wang Caijin, a coppersmith near Yuanyang Hall in the city. Later, because Wang's wife had passed away early, she brought her daughter Maideng to live with Wang as a partner, pretending to be an old housekeeper. However, the business was slow, and the economy was tight. Wang was worried day and night, without a solution. Zhang, passionate in her affair, had a strange idea. She thought that her daughter, Qindi, was 28 years old and had a pleasant appearance. Disregarding her own flesh and blood, she pawned Qindi to a prostitute house run by a Zhou in No. 306 Baoyu Lane, Dongxin Bridge, French Concession, for two years, receiving 160 yuan, which she gave to Wang to invest in his business in order to improve it. After entering the brothel, Qindi was escorted to the streets every night by prostitutes and servants to receive guests. If she slightly offended the madam, she would be severely beaten and suffered greatly. She longed to escape from the pit of fire but had no opportunity. Until about 7 PM the other day, she took advantage of the staff's inattention to escape and rushed to her aunt Zhu Zhang's house at No. 40 Dong Tangjia Lane, asking for help and spending the night. Around 7 AM yesterday morning, her aunt planned to send her to her sister, but Qindi refused and cried loudly. The incident was heard by police officer Li Zhenxiang, who was on duty at the Fourth Post, who came and took Qindi to the First Branch of the Third District. During the preliminary hearing by the station chief, Qindi tearfully recounted the events and asked for a fair judgment. Chief Jin, astonished that there could be such terrible parents in the world, immediately sent police to summon Zhang, and then wrote a document to report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Male Corpse Found Murdered on Tianbao Road</h3>
<p>Countless Knife Wounds and Bloody Mess</p>
<p>Yesterday, a male corpse was found murdered on the wasteland between Tianbao Road and Qimei Road in Hongkou. The body was about thirty years old and quite tall. He was wearing a padded jacket and trousers, tied white socks, black shoes, and a tweed overcoat. His attire was mismatched, indicating that he was not a respectable person. His head was covered with countless knife wounds, a bloody mess and a terrible sight. The area was very remote. A passerby discovered the body and reported it to the Third Branch of the Fifth District, which ordered the police to investigate but found no family. The 16th Tu local head was ordered to report to the court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Girl Crushed to Death by Car on Gonghe Road</h3>
<p>Near Gonghe Road and Huasheng Road in Zhabei, at 11:30 AM yesterday, a cargo truck with license plate Hua Zhao 3443 struck a girl when it failed to stop in time. The wheels crushed her left leg bone, and her right leg was also seriously injured, bleeding profusely. Police officer Liu Fengge from the 14th Post took the injured girl and the driver to the station. The girl was first sent to the Pushan Hospital for treatment. The driver, Yan Shaobo, 24 years old, from Tongzhou, who lives at No. 875 Wangjia Lane, Kangnaituo Road in the Concession, and drives for the Tongshang Automobile Company at No. 113 Xinzha Road, admitted to hitting the girl. The injured girl's mother, Chen Zhangshi, 29 years old, from Funing, who lives in a small lane on Gonghe Road, also reported to the police. The girl was her daughter, Xiao Liaotou, six years old. Later, the girl died of her injuries before she could be treated. The case was submitted to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of Detective Who Died in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday at 10 AM, a thief fled into a lane in Hexing Lane, Wuzhou Road. At that time, Zhu Jitang, a Chinese detective No. 294 of the Lao Zha Police Station, attempted to arrest him, but the thief opened fire, hitting a vital spot and causing his death. The thief was also shot and wounded by detective Zhu and captured. The news was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Subsequently, the Jia Yu Road Police Station received the report and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to transport the body of Zhu, who died in the line of duty, to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. The wounded thief was sent to the Municipal Council Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Zhan Liangce, the prosecutor delegated by the First Special District Court, and judicial medical recorder Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office to examine the body and took statements. Detective No. 1874 stated that a Westerner told him that there was a thief in front. After hearing this, he immediately chased after the thief to Hexing Lane on Wuzhou Road and saw the thief fighting with a plainclothes detective. He then drew his gun and fired at the thief. Detective No. 3322 stated that he was also present at the time and fired a shot, but he did not know if it hit. The deceased's wife, Zhu Wu, 35 years old, stated that the deceased was her husband, and she was cooking when the incident occurred, so she did not know the details. The Western police chief of the police station reported that the deceased's parents were still in Tianjin, and the colleagues of the Lao Zha Police Station were willing to contribute funds to buy a coffin and requested that the coffin be temporarily placed in the office until his family arrived in Shanghai and the police station had prepared for the funeral. Mr. Zhan approved the request and ordered that the body of Zhu Jitang, male, had died from head injuries sustained during his lifetime, and the body should be handed over to his wife, Zhu Wu, for burial.</p>
<h3>Digging Up Official Seals to Cure Illness</h3>
<p>Unbelievably Foolish</p>
<p>Yesterday at 12 PM, someone was digging out official seals from the Municipal Public Security Bureau's notice banning small gambling and the Garrison Headquarters' notice banning gambling that were posted on the bulletin board at Xiaobeimen with a small pocket knife, and hiding them on their body. The act was spotted by Liu Zhongheng, the patrol leader of the First Branch of the Second District, who asked why he was doing so. The person claimed that he was using them to cure illness. Fearing forgery and the crime of tearing down official documents, Patrol Leader Liu immediately took him to the station for questioning. Shen, the station chief, questioned him and learned that his name was Li Fa Lu, from Yangzhou, and he lived at No. 25 Chenyi Lane, Xin Taigu Road. His daughter was sick and could not be cured. He went to the Zizhu Nunnery in the Eight Immortals Bridge to pray for a prescription. He was told that she was possessed by an evil spirit and needed two official seals to suppress it to heal. He was anxious to cure her illness and had nowhere to find seals, so someone pointed him to the notices. He had no other intention. The officer, realizing his foolishness, lightly fined him two yuan and kept the seals on file.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Asks the County to Protect Traffic</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently approved a letter from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Engineering Department, stating that since the opening of the railway, residents along the route have been crowding around whenever they see vehicles passing, eager to watch. Some even stand in the road. Children are especially dangerous, deliberately crossing the road when cars pass or throwing mud, sand, and stones as a game. Even worse, during the day, they place obstacles on the road to block traffic, and at night, they pull up and reverse the signposts and signals along the road. Such unwarranted damage to public property is deplorable. If measures are not taken to prohibit this, the consequences will be unimaginable. It is proposed to clearly explain the dangers of the road and the protection of public property. At the same time, instruct each public security bureau to add posts in the station area to prevent and maintain road administration. In addition to separate letters, the corresponding letters are sent to your government for reference, hoping to immediately instruct compliance.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Red Pills Seized on Small Steamboat</h3>
<p>At 8:10 PM the other night, Chinese detectives No. 7 and No. 101 of the Customs Water Patrol boarded a boat to patrol the Jinliyuan Wharf area of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The captain of the Changfu Steamboat saw the detectives and, feeling guilty, reversed the boat to escape. The two detectives were unable to catch up and hid in a dark place to wait. At 9:40 PM, they saw the steamboat returning from afar and docking outside the Jiangyu Steamboat. They boarded the steamboat and seized four items that looked like luggage. Upon opening them, they found they were all red pills, a kind of narcotic, totaling thirty large packages (three hundred small boxes, each worth about eight or nine yuan), worth over two thousand yuan. On suspicion of smuggling prohibited items, they immediately took the captain Yao Zhangsheng, crew members Zhang Jintao, Shen Jintao, Ye Changgen, and Yao Yinbao, along with the steamboat, to the police station. Yao confessed that three people had hired him to transport the four pieces of luggage to the Jiangyu Steamboat at 8 PM that afternoon, and he did not know they contained narcotics. After questioning, the police chief ordered that the red pills be sent to Customs for destruction, and Yao and the other four were handed over to detective Qu Hejin for transfer to the court for interrogation yesterday afternoon. The steamboat was impounded pending further instructions from higher authorities.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Over Lion Cat Cigarette Premium Gifts</h3>
<p>Salesman Accused of Fraud</p>
<p>Released on Bail of 40,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Ford Tobacco Company, in an effort to expand sales of its Lion Cat brand cigarettes, adopted the current commercial practice of offering premium gifts, with the value of the gift determined by the quantity sold. Gongxing Tobacco Store in Jinyang Temple Lane, Hangzhou, which specializes in the sale of various cigarettes, learned that the premium gift program offered by Ford was exceptionally generous, and the gifts were valuable. They entered into a sales contract with Wu Yinting, the Ford manager from Shaoxing, and made great efforts to promote sales. In a short time, they sold over 812 cases, earning gifts worth over 40,000 yuan, which were held by Ford. Last month, Ford shipped 320 cases of Lion Cat cigarettes to Hangzhou for sale, valued at 41,420 yuan. Yang Shengyuan, the store owner, believed that this amount roughly equaled the value of the premium gifts, intending to offset the two to clear the transaction. He did not pay for the goods. However, Wu Yinting refused to pay the required expenses and went to Hangzhou to demand payment but did not receive any money. The other day, he learned that Yang Shengyuan had come to Shanghai from Hangzhou and was staying at Room 69 of the Jue Lu Hotel on Xizang Road. He reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, claiming that Gongxing Tobacco Store had closed and Yang Shengyuan had fraudulently taken money. The police chief sent detective Chen Yonggui and Western detective Klein to the Jue Lu Hotel, where they arrested Yang. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Zhang Junqing interrogated them. The defendant hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend him, claiming that it was because Ford Company did not provide the premium gifts that were due, so the defendant had to deduct the cigarette price. There was no fraud. The facts were clear. Moreover, Gongxing Tobacco Store was still operating as usual, and the defendant was a man of great wealth. The plaintiff's arbitrary accusation requested that the defendant be released on bail and that a lawsuit be filed against Kang for false accusations after the matter was investigated. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated that he had no objection to the defendant's application for bail. The defendant also presented a letter from Wang Xiaozhu, chairman of the Shanghai Business Association, proving everything. Judge Zhang then ordered that the defendant Yang Shengyuan be released on bail of 40,000 yuan, pending further investigation.</p>

Additionally, there were three silver tripod and goblet souvenirs. Over three hundred people, including all members, directors, and their families, attended the ceremony. The ceremony concluded after two o'clock, followed by a celebratory feast. Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry: Considering the brave resistance of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, members Jin Yun Silk Factory and Puyi Warp and Weft Company, after the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, immediately initiated a monthly donation for the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. All employees contribute three percent of their monthly salary. So far, Jin Yun Factory has raised over one thousand yuan for Puyi Northeast. Now, to jointly implement the expansion of the whole industry, the association plans to encourage member factories to organize monthly donations to support this great cause. At this time of crisis in the Northeast, with the clouds of war pervasive, if the factories in Shanghai launch a patriotic movement, tirelessly contributing, then the funding of the Volunteer Army will be continuously supplied, eliminating worries about the rear, and enabling them to focus on fighting the enemy for a long time.</p>
<h3>Record of the Yishan Society Members' General Meeting</h3>

<h3>Ju Jian's Bestselling</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Run wrote the book Ju Jian, based on his years of chrysanthemum cultivation experience, considering both new and old methods for cultivation, and adding illustrations that everyone can understand. Artists and growers have praised it highly. The different types of chrysanthemums have different cultivation methods that have changed from the past. Over the past few hundred years in Beijing, experts have researched propagation and breeding, making continuous progress. However, those who love the old despise the new, and those who like the new dislike the old. It is difficult to find someone who can integrate and thoroughly explain the reasons. The Lu Shi Yi Ju Zhi cites extensively, but omits details on cultivation methods. In modern times, with the development of science, soil and fertilizers are becoming more refined, with each flower able to reach a full diameter of more than a foot, which is rarely seen in ancient times. Mr. Huang has always loved growing chrysanthemums and has studied them deeply. His book, Ju Jian, gathers a wealth of theories and is truly a pioneering work in the horticultural world. Moreover, the price is very low (only one yuan), so it has been selling very well since publication. However, there are few books left, so those who love chrysanthemums should buy them quickly. The Shanghai Shen Bao also has consignment sales.</p>

On the same day last year, the highest was 69.3 degrees, and the lowest was 38.7 degrees.</p>
<h3>件費唐法官研究上海公共租界情形報告書第四卷（十六）</h3>
<p>Chapter Four: Qualifications of Directors and Regulations on the Conduct and Tenure of Directors</p>
<p>1.  (The provisions regarding the qualifications of directors as stated in the Land Regulations relate only to the economic qualifications of directors, that is, anyone who contributes a certain amount to the municipal revenue is qualified to be a director, as mentioned earlier, Note 1.) According to Clause 19 of the Land Regulations, the qualifications of directors are higher than those of voters. No one (unless, in addition to license fees, they pay a full fifty taels of land and house tax estimated by the Public Works Department each year, or the rent paid to the Public Works Department for their residence is estimated at one thousand one hundred taels each year) is eligible to be elected as a director.</p>
<p>2.  Usually, municipal organization laws contain a clear provision that, under certain circumstances, one cannot be elected as a councilor or retain their position as a councilor. This type of disqualification generally includes the following:</p>
<p>(1) Anyone serving as an official of the Municipal Council or holding any lucrative position under the Municipal Council is not eligible to be elected as a councilor or serve as a councilor.</p>
<p>(2) Any director who, without leave of absence, fails to attend Municipal Council meetings for a certain period shall be immediately dismissed.</p>
<p>(3) Except in certain exceptional cases, if a director has an economic relationship with a contract made by the Municipal Council, the director shall immediately recuse themselves.</p>
<p>(4) Anyone who has committed a serious crime and has been convicted, declared mentally unsound by the competent court, or declared bankrupt and whose debts have not been cleared is not qualified to be elected as a director or retain their position as a director.</p>
<p>3.  For the purpose of providing an example, the provisions of the Tianjin British Concession Land Regulations regarding the above (1), (3), and (4) are quoted as follows: Article 14 (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 13, anyone in any of the following circumstances is not qualified to be elected as a director or to serve as a director:</p>
<p>(A) The Municipal Auditor, or anyone serving as an official or holding any lucrative position under the authority or disposal of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>(B) Anyone who, either personally or through their partners, has a direct or indirect share or interest in any contract made with the Board of Directors or on behalf of the directors, or in any business undertaken by the directors.</p>
<p>(2) However, no one shall be disqualified from being elected as a director or serving as a director, or be deemed to have a share or interest in such a contract or undertaking, solely because they have a share or interest in the following matters:</p>
<p>(A) Any lease, sale, or purchase of land, or any contract for the lease, sale, or purchase of land.</p>
<p>(B) Any contract for borrowing money, or any guarantee solely for the payment of money.</p>
<p>(C) Contracts awarded through public bidding, in which the director concerned has not participated in the vote on whether or not to accept them.</p>
<p>(D) Any newspaper publishing any advertisements concerning municipal affairs, or,</p>
<p>(E) Any contract entered into by any limited liability company with the Board of Directors regarding the supply of electric light, water, or any other matter within the municipality. (3) Any director who is accused of committing an indictable offense or is subject to bankruptcy proceedings shall not continue to hold their position as a director.</p>
<p>4.  Apart from any explicit provisions on this issue, I firmly believe that the various restrictions on the qualifications and conduct of directors mentioned above have, in the past, been largely considered reasonable and necessary by the enlightened society within the Public Concession and have therefore been observed by the parties concerned. However, in view of the proposals that have been put forward (Note 2), namely (i) to increase the number of directors and (ii) to extend the term of office of directors to two years, I believe that when the Land Regulations are amended, it is appropriate to include explicit provisions regarding this matter. I do not wish to elaborate on how this provision should be worded, but I can briefly discuss a few points.</p>
<p>5.  Although the ineligibility of Public Works Department officials to serve as directors is not explicitly stipulated in the Land Regulations, I firmly believe that this restriction has been considered necessary in the past and that the current Public Works Department should not allow any official to stand as a candidate for director or allow the appointment of any director to any position under the control of the Board of Directors while also allowing them to retain their seat as a director. This can be safely assumed without any doubt. However, for the sake of future protection, it seems advisable to have a clear provision that if the distinction between directors and Public Works Department officials is not strictly maintained, and officials of all levels of the Public Works Department are deemed eligible to be elected as directors, then the nature of the Public Works Department and the entire governance of the Public Concession will soon be completely changed. However, as things stand, this change may be achieved without even changing the text of the Land Regulations.</p>
<p>It should be noted that foreign employees of the Public Works Department are exempt from paying house tax and other municipal taxes according to their service regulations, so they currently cannot obtain the qualifications necessary for voters or directors.</p>
<p>6.  As for the vacancy of a director due to non-attendance at meetings, Clause 47 of the amended Board of Directors Rules contains the following provision:</p>
<p>For the welfare of society, it is hereby proposed that any director who needs to leave Shanghai for three months or more should submit their resignation to the Chairman for their disposal so that when the Board of Directors decides to elect a replacement to fill the vacancy, they may proceed with the election. According to Article 20 of the Land Regulations, vacancies for current directors (if there are no more than three vacancies, may be filled by the serving directors through a plurality vote).</p>
<p>If the term of office of directors is extended from one year to two years, it is clearly even more important to establish a regulation regarding vacancies for directors due to frequent non-attendance at meetings or due to inability to attend meetings due to leaving Shanghai, illness, or other reasons.</p>
<p>7.  The nature of the regulation regarding the economic relationship between directors and contracts made by the Public Works Department is one of the most difficult issues that has been discussed. However, this issue is particularly important because, after the number of directors is increased in the future, it will affect the high degree of financial integrity that the Public Works Department has the ability to maintain, which has been a characteristic of its administration.</p>
<p>8.  The Public Works Department's rules of procedure contain the following provisions to restrict the right of directors of the Board of Directors and members of committees to speak or vote on matters with which they have an economic relationship:</p>
<p>(Article 34: Any director who has an economic relationship with a matter scheduled for discussion shall declare such relationship, and shall comply if requested by the Chairman not to speak, vote, or withdraw from the meeting.)</p>
<p>(Article 77: Any member who has an economic relationship with a matter scheduled for discussion shall declare such relationship, and shall comply if requested by the other members not to speak, vote, or withdraw from the meeting.)</p>
<p>9.  Although the above two rules are based on the principle that a director or member should not vote or try to influence their colleagues' votes on any matter if they have a private economic relationship with that matter, the procedure of this provision is open to criticism. This is because it does not unconditionally prohibit the speech or vote of the director or member concerned, but leaves the question of whether or not to prohibit it to the discretion of the Chairman in one case and to the members of the committee concerned in the other. This may sometimes cause embarrassment or resentment to the Chairman or the committee's decision. I believe that a more appropriate approach would be to establish a definite standard whereby a director or member may not participate in the discussion or vote on any matter with which they have an economic relationship, or may even be required to withdraw from the meeting room when the matter is brought up for debate or put to a vote. However, an exception may be made if the relationship of the director or member is shared by the majority of the public. Another point to note is that the existing wording seems to refer only to the personal economic relationship of the director or committee member, and does not explicitly include the economic relationship of the firm or company that employs the director or member.</p>
<p>In an appendix to this report (Note 3), I have cited the more definitive and comprehensive provisions of the Durban Transvaal Municipal Regulations regarding this issue as an illustration.</p>
<p>10. In addition to the issue of restricting directors or members from speaking or voting on any matter with which they have an economic relationship, there is also the issue of whether directors or members should have any relationship with any contract made by the Public Works Department, with certain limited exceptions. When considering this issue, one must take into account, on the one hand, the need to effectively protect the public interest so that directors or members do not seek to use their position to advance their private interests, and on the other hand, the need to avoid establishing unnecessary restrictions that would deter responsible businessmen from serving as directors because such restrictions would harm their personal business or the business of the firm or company they represent. Strict restrictions may disqualify businessmen who are otherwise qualified to be directors, which would risk weakening the talent of the Board of Directors. Moreover, if contracts made by the municipality with which the director or the firm they represent have an economic relationship can be guaranteed to be public, there would not be a serious risk of directors improperly using their position. This has already been acknowledged elsewhere.</p>
<p>11. From this perspective, there are only two options for adoption: (1) to prohibit directors from entering into contracts with the Public Works Department or having a relationship with contracts made by the Public Works Department, with certain limited exceptions; (2) to establish a regulation that (A) any relationship between a contract made with the Public Works Department and a director shall be formally disclosed so that it is known to all; (B) the director concerned shall not participate in the discussion or vote on issues relating to the contract.</p>
<p>In an appendix to this report (Note 4), I have cited provisions of the Durban Transvaal Municipal Regulations that serve as an illustration of two alternative approaches to this issue.</p>
<p>(Note 1) See Section 30 of Chapter Six of Part Five of this report.</p>
<p>(Note 2) See the reform plans (3) and (6) in Chapter Six (Section E) of Part Five of this report.</p>
<p>(Note 3) See Appendix 43, Article 41 of the Local Government Ordinance of 1926.</p>
<p>(Note 4) See Appendix 43, Articles 39 and 40 of the Local Government Ordinance of 1926, and see Articles 38 and 42 of the same ordinance, which prohibit municipal councilors from competing for any specialized professional awards, whether in support of family associations or in opposition to the municipal council, and do not allow municipal councilors to attend, as parties concerned, the valuation tribunals established by the municipal council or the licensing committees organized by the municipal council.

<h3>Sutra Chanting, Temple Building, and Education</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Recently, things in society seem a bit "abnormal," perhaps what biologists call "recessive reappearance" or what psychologists call "atavism"? Otherwise, why do we feel like we are treading in the footsteps of the past everywhere we go?</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, look at the sutra chanting in Beiping. Now, immortals are no longer born into the world, but there are still Buddhist masters in Shanghai, which can be considered fortunate. According to reports, the Vajra Dharma Assembly received a total of three to five hundred thousand donations from various parties, spending no less than two or three hundred thousand gold, how grand! It would make the little monks speechless. It's comparable to Emperor Wu of Liang in recent times, and traces back to the era of the Investiture of the Gods, which is probably not too far off. It's a pity that they couldn't curse the wooden clogs to death, which is a great regret. It's probably because the other side also has deities. When deities meet, it's like positive and negative forces opposing each other in physics, and the effects cancel each other out. The merits of the recent Dharma Assembly have just been completed, and the construction of a temple is about to begin. A Nanjing telegram reported the other day that thirty thousand was needed to repair the Confucius Temple, and the National Government is urging the Ministry of Finance to allocate the funds, which shows that the country cares for both military strength and cultural advancement. It truly takes both sides into account. Only the Ministry of Finance has a title but no money, and the common people have lives but no wealth. The educational expenses of Pingjin have been owed for a long time, and the teachers of Lanzhou Elementary School have gone on strike due to a lack of funds. (See Xi'an telegram on the 2nd of this month as reported). How fortunate to be dead? How unfortunate to be alive?</p>
<p>Since the Confucius Temple is related to ancient Chinese culture and its architecture is worth preserving, although I am not a disciple of the sage, I do not have any objections. However, this is something that should be done when the country is at peace and the national treasury is abundant, not at the present time. Confucius once criticized Guan Zhong for his "three returns" and the Lu for "carving rafters." Now, he cannot escape this either? Reciting the words "If you cannot serve people, how can you serve ghosts?" I can't help but sigh three times.</p>
<p>Or it is said that building temples and chanting sutras is not for the dead, but for the living. In that case, I have no objections.</p>

<h3>Two Poems Inspired by Reading the Report of the Investigation Team</h3>
<p>— Yi Bingchu</p>
<p>Like a barbarian interpreter, it startlingly became a volume, tears secretly fall after reading it, the natives all envy the land, the talentless are collectively deceived, the barbarian child runs wild in the northern desert, a fierce general manipulates the vast pond, orderly management forgets traces, what private desires are expected?</p>
<p>Poem Two</p>
<p>Who determined the last teaching to be handed down, in vain did we meet in dreams, the pedantic scholars truly mislead the country, great generals endure peace agreements, the wind and dust of the four borders stir, the atmosphere of the three frontiers is exhausted, the dragons lament being out of place, the five horses each go west and east.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Common Misunderstandings About Biology (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xiaoguang</p>
<p>(6) Bats are Transformed from Mice</p>
<p>Bats and mice have somewhat similar head shapes, and both reside in secluded places of people's homes, venturing out at night to find food. Therefore, some people say that bats are transformed from mice. This is a (similar inference) error. In zoology, bats belong to the order Chiroptera of mammals (not birds), while mice belong to the order Rodentia. Bats have thin membranes stretched between their limbs and tail, allowing them to fly, and they feed on insects. Their habits are completely different from those of mice.</p>
<p>(7) Crabs Have No Blood</p>
<p>In some local dialects, the phrase "(no)" is often replaced by "(crab blood)". However, it's just not red. Its heart is composed of a single atrium and a single ventricle, serving circulatory functions. It breathes through gills, taking in oxygen from the water to purify the blood. Also, Bao Puzi says: "(In the mountains, what is called the 'Intestineless Gentleman' is the crab)"; the common saying that crabs have "(seven legs, eight hands, and no intestines)" is also a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>(8) Rhinoceros Horns Can Illuminate Demons and Divide Water</p>
<p>The legend that rhinoceros horns can illuminate demons probably originated from the Book of Jin: "When Wen Qiao arrived at Niuzhu Islet, the water was too deep to measure, and the world said that there were many monsters underneath. Qiao then burned a rhinoceros horn and illuminated it. After a short while, he saw aquatic creatures covering the fire, strange and bizarre shapes." This is unfounded. Rhinoceros are a type of herbivorous animal, slightly smaller than elephants, with hairless, extremely thick skin. In ancient times, it was used to make armor. Those produced in Tibet and India have one horn on their nose, called the one-horned rhinoceros; those produced in Africa have two horns on their nose, called the two-horned rhinoceros. The horn is dense and hard, and can be used to make utensils or for medicinal purposes. Both of these types of rhinoceros like to swim, with their horns exposed above the water, advancing across the waves. Therefore, those who see them mistakenly believe that rhinoceros horns can divide water.</p>
<p>(9) Ghost Howling</p>
<p>The belief that humans have souls after death is almost a universal concept among various peoples of the world. It is said that souls have perception and can act, and of course they can also speak. Thus, the superstition of "ghost howling" has been fabricated! Li Hua's Elegy for the Ancient Battlefield says: "Often overturning entire armies, often with ghosts crying, heard on cloudy days." Du Fu's Ballad of the Army Carts says: "New ghosts are troubled by injustice, old ghosts cry, with the sound of chirping on cloudy and rainy days." They speak so decisively, as if it were true. However, the origin of sound lies in the vibration of objects. When a person dies, the body decomposes and the spiritual function also disappears with it. Where would there be a soul? Where would there be ghost howling? Wang Chong's Lun Heng: "Whenever there are ghosts between heaven and earth, they are not made by the spirits of the dead, but are all caused by people's thoughts and imaginations. How is this caused? It is due to illness. When people are sick, they worry and fear, and worry and fear are where ghosts come from." This is very true—the so-called ghost howling is actually the cry of a night bird (commonly known as the owl). Suiyuan Shihua records Wang Fengting's poem: "Strange bird's voice is like a ghost, and dark tree shadows resemble people." This can be said to be exactly what I think.</p>
<p>(10) Cucumbers and Peanuts Cannot Be Eaten Together</p>
<p>Cucumbers (Hu gua) are commonly known as yellow melons or cucumbers. Zhang Qian brought their seeds from the Western Regions during his mission, hence the name. Peanuts are also known as "longevity fruits." They bloom in late summer and autumn, with yellow, butterfly-shaped flowers. After the flowers, the ovary enters the ground, forming pods, hence the name "falling peanuts." It is said that these two fruits cannot be eaten together, and that eating them together is enough to harm life. Some people have analyzed their ingredients, and no trace of toxic substances can be detected, no matter how they are combined. Furthermore, eating them together for a long time has no adverse effects.</p>
<h3>Loyal Sails Swallowed by This</h3>
<p>Society Improvement Discussion Group</p>
<h3>Reply to the Criticism of "Abolishing the Evil Custom of Teasing the Newlyweds"</h3>
<p>— Xiaoxue</p>
<p>"Humans are emotional and excitable animals, at least partially true, because of this…the rituals and red tape of the human world become excessive." Wen Bingjun starts by expounding the elements of social evolution. However, social evolution and human civilization require rational consideration in addition to emotion. Indeed, actions based on emotion and momentary excitement are often wrong. Only reason can judge the good and evil of things. If an act of exciting emotion is not rationally considered, it can be called evil because it hinders social evolution. Then, a custom that is carried down through tradition without rational thought can be called an evil habit. Therefore, teasing the newlyweds is no exception.</p>
<p>The initiator of teasing the newlyweds (a speculation, as it cannot be verified) may have given it consideration, but gradually, under tradition, to the present, the consideration has long been buried and forgotten. That is why there are barbaric acts because of a lack of consideration. If you ask someone who has just finished teasing the newlyweds: "Old X, why are you teasing the newlyweds?" He will definitely stare blankly, or say: "Teasing the newlyweds is to have fun. Drinking alone is boring, don't you understand?" This phenomenon is prevalent in the psychology of the masses, even among the intelligentsia.</p>
<p>It is precisely because the true meaning of teasing the newlyweds has been lost, it is precisely because modern people lack rational consideration, and it is precisely because it relies on emotional action and the action of excitement that I have proposed its abolition.</p>
<p>The above paragraphs of theory can prove that it is an evil habit of society. And Mr. Wen's saying that I am "deliberately making dangerous words" is a bit too arbitrary and without consideration?! Mr. Wen's examples of A, B, and C are "feared" to be fictional, which needs to be corrected. When I wrote this article, I tried my best to shorten the length. Therefore, the statement of facts was too simple, which made Mr. Wen suspect that it was "feared" to be fictional. This fact was obtained from my exploration among married and unmarried young students. Their psychology is all like this, and it has also taken shape in facts. Mr. Wen has not seen it, but I have explored it and seen it.</p>
<p>Mr. Wen believes that the conflict between the groom and the guests is "perhaps" (accidental). If Mr. Wen looks around and looks at the whole of China, he will know that it is not "perhaps" "accidental"! But it often happens!</p>
<p>If Mr. Wen does not "fear" that teasing the newlyweds is an evil habit, please refer to the Jiangxi tricks in the News Tea Talk column, a little bit about the tricks in Shanghai and its surroundings, and a little bit about the tricks in the whole Chinese society!</p>
<p>Mr. Wen sits in Shanghai and shouts "advocate", but it only increases the sins of Chinese society!</p>
<p>Evil Customs</p>
<h3>The October Morning Festival</h3>
<p>— Shiben</p>
<p>The "tang, tang, tang" of the gong powerfully pierced my eardrums. Then there was a burst of noise and a cacophony of musical instruments, coming from far away, melodious and moving. Ah! Which family is welcoming a new bride again? I wondered in my heart.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the door, it was dark and crowded. Many people from the neighborhood had already gathered, men and women dressed in colorful clothes, flocking from all directions. Today's excitement had already violently broken through the quiet atmosphere of Town A, which was so calm that you could catch ghosts.</p>
<p>After a burst of hubbub and deafening music, I saw triangular flags with red silk and green edges, embroidered with golden dragons with claws, fluttering and dancing, coming in a mighty and grand procession. Behind them followed pairs of signboards with white characters on black backgrounds and gold characters on red backgrounds, and the luanjia of swords, spears, and all kinds of weapons. These things filled with feudal colors, obsolete and outdated objects, passed by like shuttles in a never-ending stream. Ah! I guessed wrong, it's not someone's wedding, but some kind of play of welcoming gods and holding a festival. So I couldn't help but sigh deeply. Alas! Internal troubles and external invasions, the country is about to perish. The proper and urgent national salvation movement is not being done, but people are excitedly and enthusiastically doing this kind of ignorant, wasteful, and prohibited act of welcoming gods and holding festivals. It is truly a drunken dream. But I was not touched by the scenery and felt sad and sighed. Instead, the crowd was filled with an atmosphere of approval and welcome. Burning incense, lighting candles, worshipping, everyone was smiling happily and enthusiastically rejoicing. The people in the shops on both sides also cracked their mouths, pointing east and west, enthusiastically talking:</p>
<p>"Hee hee, the Tiangang flag is coming! I remember that there are thirty-six Tiangang flags in total. The first one is the Liangshan hero, Song Gongming, who assassinated Yan Poxi!"</p>
<p>"Lao Sun, look, the two signboards 'Xiao Jing' (Silence) and 'Tao Dun' (Escape) are here!" The young clerk in the southern goods store said to a colleague named Sun.</p>
<p>"Hum! Shameless, you should know the commander-in-chief of the Bai Liao. These two signboards, one is called 'Su Jing' (Quiet) and the other is called 'Hui Bi' (Avoidance). You read them as 'Xiao Jing Tao Dun.' It seems that your characters were taught by Confucius's great-grandmother!" The clerk surnamed Sun said, proudly, and the young clerk next to him was ashamed and red-faced.</p>
<p>"Look, look, the imperial mandate is here! Oh dear, this old man is really imposing. There are eight imperial mandates! No wonder he is so efficacious! Ordinary goblins and monsters will immediately shiver when they see his eight imperial mandates, so when people get sick and ask for this old man, they will get better immediately, because he has many imperial mandates." These feudal, nonsensical, superstitious words were spoken by a man who looked like a merchant.</p>
<p>"Oh! It's so beautiful! There are also people carrying incense pillars participating! Hahahaha…" Amid the applause and shouts of joy, more than a dozen courageous, spirited, and energetic young villagers appeared, all with bare arms, and many iron hooks pierced into their arms, tied with a red rope, with stone lions, flower pots, and other things hanging below. This is called "carrying incense pillars". Alas! Courageous, piercing good meat with iron hooks and hanging thirty or forty pounds of things, it's a pity that this kind of self-sacrificing spirit is not used to serve the country, but is used for this superstitious act. "The old man is here! Quickly light firecrackers to welcome him!" With a burst of loud firecrackers, I saw many people crowding around a wooden puppet, coming. The shop owners across the street respectfully knelt down and kowtowed like pounding garlic, and they all burned incense and burned silver ingots, busying themselves happily.</p>
<p>The sound of the gong rang, and a group of ignorant men and women, again crowded the wooden puppet to another place. After watching, I went inside, and my mother asked me, "Shi'er, was the October Morning Festival good to watch today?"</p>
<p>Joke</p>
<h3>Umbrellas and Chamber Pots</h3>
<p>— Ying Shi</p>
<p>In our village, there was a gentleman who was very wealthy. People flattered him by calling him a local tycoon. However, he had never attended school. Whenever people borrowed money or items from him, he would always draw pictures in his account book to keep track. For example, if he lent several dozen silver dollars, he would draw several dozen circles representing silver dollars. If he lent several bowls, he would draw several bowl shapes.</p>
<p>He had a relative through marriage who was an unsuccessful scholar. His family was quite poor. Once, he came to visit when the tycoon was out, so he sat alone in silence. Suddenly, he saw the account book on the table and aimlessly flipped through it. "Oh my," he thought, "how can such a good account book be made so dirty and unsightly?" So he asked the family's servant, "What is this used for?" The servant replied, "That is my master's account book. All the silver money lent out and goods bought in are written in this account book." Upon hearing this, the scholar sighed deeply. "Alas," he said, "how can such an illiterate man become rich, while I, though untalented, am still a scholar, be so impoverished?" He sighed with emotion and wrote the words "fate" on the account book with his brush, then left.</p>
<p>Later, the illiterate tycoon returned and saw the marks on the account book. He asked the servant, "Was there anyone here while I was out?" The servant replied, "It was so-and-so, your relative by marriage, who came to visit." When he heard this, he threw the account book on the table and said angrily, "I told you not to associate with these poor devils. They come running here just to borrow an umbrella and find a chamber pot!" Haha, he thought the character "fate" was a drawing of an umbrella, and the character "also" was a drawing of a chamber pot. The shapes were somewhat similar, which was truly laughable.</p>
<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3>Prepared but Not Used</h3>
<p>— Zu Lai</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, the accountant, suggested, "The world is going downhill, and thieves are active day and night. We are truly in danger with silver dollars coming in and out all day long. Therefore, I suggest we install an alarm bell, prepared but not used. What do you all think?" The colleagues agreed unanimously with Mr. Wang and praised him for his thoroughness.</p>
<p>Three days later, a square red glass lantern was found above the main gate of XX business. The words "Alarm" were written on the glass.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, by sheer coincidence, robbers came to the door less than a week later. One guarded the main gate, one guarded the back gate, and four others rushed into the counter with pistols. "Be sensible!" one of the robbers said fiercely.</p>
<p>The colleagues, seeing the four pistols, were so frightened that their souls flew out of their bodies. Some crawled under the stools, and others hid under the counter. They had long forgotten about the alarm bell. The robbers unceremoniously took the three thousand yuan in banknotes and four hundred yuan in cash from the table and swaggered away.</p>
<p>The colleagues, seeing that the robbers had left, slowly crawled out from under the stools or the counter, but their faces were pale and they were as stiff as wooden chickens. After a long time, they began to argue. "Why didn't you press the alarm bell?" "If I pressed the alarm bell, would you want to keep your life?" "When I saw the pistol, my soul was gone. How could I think of pressing the alarm bell?" "Ah, life is dangerous!" Mr. Li, known as the king of humor, interjected, "This is what you call 'prepared but not used'!"</p>
<p>Nonsense</p>
<h3>In the Courtroom</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Judge: Why did you rob people?</p>
<p>Thug: Because I was hungry and had no food, and cold and had no clothes, so I became a robber and robbed people.</p>
<p>Judge: If you have no clothes and no food, you should find a job. How can you rob people?</p>
<p>Thug: In this time of economic decline, the number of unemployed is increasing every day. Where can you find a job? And to start a small business, the registration fee is not enough to cover the expenses. If you don't pay the registration fee, you have to use small copper coins to pay respects to the XX gentlemen and suffer a lot of injustice. Alas! Alas! Those who have not experienced it themselves will never know the suffering of society!</p>
<p>Judge: Now, according to Article XX of the law, I sentence you to X years and X months of imprisonment. Do you accept it?</p>
<p>Thug: I accept it very much. I can no longer worry about being cold and hungry! The thug walked away with a smile on his face, as if he was very proud.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Judge: Why was the car driving so fast? It killed a pedestrian!</p>
<p>Big shot: Because driving fast shows off my status. If I didn't drive fast, why would I be driving a car?</p>
<p>Judge: I sentence you to pay the family of the deceased three hundred yuan in compensation. Does the car owner agree?</p>
<p>Big shot: What is three hundred yuan? My monthly expenses are more than three hundred yuan!</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Plaintiff (female): The defendant started with affection but abandoned me in the end. Now he has a new lover and has discarded me like old shoes. Therefore, I am filing for divorce and demanding that the defendant pay 25,000 yuan in alimony because the defendant's assets are more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Judge: Defendant, the plaintiff is demanding 25,000 yuan in alimony. Are you willing to pay?</p>
<p>Defendant (male): I am not willing. I am only willing to pay 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Judge: Plaintiff, 5,000 yuan is enough. If the defendant has no money, there is nothing you can do. You can't skin him alive, can you?</p>
<p>Plaintiff (female): Oh...</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Night Raid</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>An Imaginary Painting of the Righteous Army Recapturing Fanyang City: The great wheel of time has already brought us into the realm of autumn. This night was a cool, pleasant, and beautiful autumn night. A street in the west of the city was quiet. The pedestrians had already closed their doors and hid in their houses, waiting and praying for a peaceful tomorrow. Only the old trees along the street stood tall, bathed in the bleak electric light and the light breeze and drizzle. Their branches and leaves swayed, sending out rustling sounds. In the distance, the barking of dogs in the small alleys occasionally broke the silence of the night.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a dark, blurred figure, holding something like a pole in his hand, crawled forward like a snake from the end of the street, feeling his way with his hands and feet, sometimes hidden, sometimes visible. He crawled behind an old tree and hid himself. After a while, another shadow emerged in the same way. Then another. And another! In an instant, behind every old tree, there was a majestic shadow holding a pole and swaying.</p>
<p>It was midnight. The light rain gradually became heavy and violent. The wind howled and roared with all its might! Only the electric light still maintained its bleakness and gloom...</p>
<p>"Boom!" A sound like the collapse of heaven and earth came from outside the city gate. Five hundred righteous soldiers shouted in unison, pointing their guns at the city gate and rushing forward! The torches were held high, dyeing half the sky red. The shadows behind the old trees all jumped out into the center of the street, pulled out torches, and simultaneously moved the mechanisms on the poles. "Peng! Peng! Peng!" One person first rushed onto the city wall and chopped down the enemy soldier guarding it. He quickly opened the city gate, and five hundred tiger-like warriors surged in like a tide!</p>
<p>The enemies were having sweet dreams. They were awakened and hurriedly issued an emergency assembly order. Some of the enemies began to mobilize.</p>
<p>"Kill! Kill!" "Peng!" "Boom!" The curtain of terror was clearly drawn open! Reflected in people's eyes were torches! Blood! Heads! Corpses!</p>
<p>"Kill! Kill! Sons of China! The time has come! Settle the blood debt with the enemy tonight! Don't let a single one go! Drown the enemy in the blood of our Chinese nation! Kill! Kill!"</p>
<p>The enemy's line was shattered! The iron cavalry of the righteous army filled the four sides of the city!</p>

<p>Overseas Rare News</p>
<h3>Hollywood's Economic Recovery (Jieke)</h3>
<p>The global economic panic has also severely hit Hollywood. Hollywood has 14,000 extras. They have been unemployed and starving for two years. Now, because Cecil B. DeMille is creating a great new historical film, "The Sign of the Cross," one-third of them have been able to eat milk and sandwiches again. Today's Hollywood is vibrant again, just like in the golden age. Every day at 5:30 p.m., hundreds and thousands of male and female actors in Roman costumes are collecting their salaries at the window of the Hollywood accounting office. On the sidewalks, there are ancient Christian believers, slaves in leopard skins, and men and women in Roman costumes mingling with the crowds. DeMille's genius has solved Hollywood's unemployment problem.</p>
<p>In January of this year, as soon as the news that DeMille was going to direct the new film "The Sign of the Cross" came out, he was immediately surrounded by actors. DeMille had to spend eighteen hours a day listening to the endless ringing of the phone and reading the snowflakes of letters. In front of his office, densely packed men and women shouted, "Mr. DeMille, for God's sake, use me! I haven't had anything to do for months. My wife relies on the relief association. My son is also sick. Have pity on me."</p>
<p>"This is so heartbreaking," DeMille said with a smile. "Wherever I go, they follow. Choosing a few and rejecting a few is really a heartbreaking job. For one scene, we have to choose fifty people from more than two hundred people. Looking at the faces of those who are rejected, ah, how uncomfortable it is."</p>
<p>DeMille's new film employs actors of all sizes, some for only a few days, some for the entire film. One scene features a group of Christians secretly praying by a grave on the edge of Rome. Roman soldiers shoot arrows one after another, killing many. Many actors pleaded mournfully not to be made to look like they were shot dead because once they were shot dead, they could no longer be used in the film.</p>
<p>Hollywood has 14,000 registered actors. Two years ago, most of them could make a living from filming. In the past, every film had to have a lively scene, otherwise the audience would not be satisfied. DeMille used 3,000 people in one scene in the film "The Ten Commandments." The filming of films such as "Ben-Hur" brought together hundreds of actors, married and had children, and gave them warmth and food for several years. Now, a scene with 200 people is considered very lively. After the success of DeMille's new film, it can recover a lot of the decline.</p>

<h3>Another New Film by a Star Will Be Released Soon (Xiaogu)</h3>
<p>Because Star Film Company wants to increase production, it has been working hard to recruit directors and actors in the past few months, preparing to open several more groups for filming. In addition to Hu Ping, Sun Min, Ai Xia, and Xuan Jinglin and Wang Ying, who are currently in negotiations, the director is Li Pingqian. Mr. Li has been with Tianyi Company for many years. The first film he directed was "Old Hatred and New Sorrow," written by Wang Qianbai. This is a story of pain caused by love. The plot is very intricate and stars Gong Jianong and Ai Xia. It is currently being directed by Mr. Li and working hard. It will be completed soon and is expected to be released in the middle of this month.</p>
<p>Anecdotes of Movie Stars</p>
<h3>The Original Appearance of Stars (Sipei)</h3>
<p>The comedian Charlie Chaplin always wears a mustache, old clothes, and a pair of broken leather shoes when he acts in movies. However, his original appearance is very handsome. It is only because of years of hard work, coupled with the divorce, that he is in a bad mood, and his hair has turned gray.</p>
<h3>A Movie That Can Be Smelled (Jieke)</h3>
<p>The saying that science is omnipotent is a proven fact that does not need to be proven again today. The movie thing has created an amazing record in recent years due to the progress of science. In the past, silent and colorless films have now become sound and color films, which are popular all over the world. People's joys, sorrows, anger, curses, words, songs, cries, and even the collapse of mountains and seas and the roars of lions and tigers in the universe, all sounds can now be easily heard in the films. Now comes a peculiar news saying that European and American scientists will soon invent a movie that can be smelled. If we believe that science is omnipotent, then this news is reliable. The source of this news is this. The British Science Association held a meeting in London in September this year. A scientist declared that he firmly believed that smelly movies would soon become a reality. We will soon be able to smell the fragrance of flowers on the film. In the past, Hollywood needed to select shadows and dubbing, but in the future, it will select odors.</p>
<p>Marie Dressler is a very beautiful and fair-skinned girl on the screen, but her original appearance is covered with freckles.</p>
<p>Douglas Fairbanks's face is very dark and full of beards. If he doesn't shave for a day or two, and kisses his wife Mary Pickford, the stiff whiskers will touch her tender cheeks, and a good wife may even cry out in pain.</p>
<p>John Gilbert is a famous young man in the film industry. He is very handsome, but his big nose and long neck are famous in Hollywood. If the collar of his costume is not properly made, or the photographer does not pay attention to the angle of photography, then the shortcomings of his long neck and big nose will be easily exposed to the audience.</p>
<p>Tom Mix, a star of horsemanship, still plays the role of a Western cowboy in love with young girls. He is nearly fifty years old, and deep wrinkles have grown on his forehead. Fortunately, there is a makeup box to repair and cover up, so he looks only thirty years old.</p>
<p>William Powell often plays the role of gangsters and thugs, but he is a noble gentleman himself. People in Hollywood call him "Uncle William," which shows his kindness and amiability.</p>
<p>The deceased movie star Lon Chaney was known for disguising himself as disabled freaks and performing venomous and cruel personalities. However, he himself was physically strong and very kind by nature. Even the doorman of the MGM film company where he served, he condescended to be friendly with, and there was no arrogance at all. Therefore, when the bad news came that Lon Chaney had died, many people were heartbroken for him.</p>
<p>Opinions and Contributions</p>
<h3>A Brief Review of Domestic Films (Lu Meng)</h3>
<p>Movies in modern times can be said to be at their peak! Of course, the development of this industry is not only due to the welcome of the people in society, but its existence in terms of value really occupies a very important component. In recent years, domestic films have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, adding a lot of light to the future of Chinese films. I will write about my humble opinion.</p>
<h3>On the Trends of Soviet Films in the Past Fifteen Years (Continued) (Shi Yi)</h3>
<p>(According to the opinions of Harry Alan Potamkin)</p>
<p>In the study of the progress of Soviet films, we may as well talk about the personal experiences of its film artists. As far as Protozanov is concerned, he directed "Aelita" and "The Man from the Restaurant." One of these films was the worst film influenced by Germany. This influence belonged to an incorrect type of proletariat; but after that, he also produced several of the best comedies, depicting in detail the aggressive "St. George's Holiday" and "Siberian Sentinels." Protozanov is one of the ancestors of Soviet films; he proposed the theory of Montage very early. Although he is still unwilling to forget the traces of his early past, he is able to give his films a lively vitality with his unique talent for "humor," which is where he is good at dealing with himself.</p>
<p>We cannot but admire the spirit and efforts of those engaged in the film industry, but there are still many shortcomings, so we believe that it is necessary to discuss them.</p>
<p>Error in Concept: At present, the general film industry often uses "sensuality" and "glamour" to please the lustful audience and seek to satisfy its box office. This low-level mentality is really enough to make the film itself bankrupt. I do not admit that this is driven by the social environment, but an error in concept. They have forgotten the true meaning of film art, which is to suggest the transformation of behavior, so that the films produced are all regarded as "entertainment" and "toys," brandishing weapons, which cannot but make people sigh!</p>
<p>Naivety of Consciousness: This is probably something that no one can deny. Of course, modern European and American films are not worthy of saying that their consciousness is very noble and rich, but they are much better than China. Originally, "consciousness" is the most important thing in the film. If the "consciousness" is not strong, there will be no impression on the audience, and there is even the danger of being worthless. The problem with Chinese films in the past twenty years is that they only know "imitation" and do not know "creation," so "consciousness" has also been greatly affected. Then its naivety is of course also in the absolute possibility. We only need to watch domestic films a few more times to discover this situation.</p>
<p>Director's Imperfection: In the filming process, the most important responsibility is the director. He is the person who translates a readable script into a visible action. Since his task is so important, then his difficulties of course also arise. Therefore, a director must not only have sufficient various ideas, but also have a long time of preparation; but Chinese film directors mostly act hastily, so that after the entire production is completed, "flaws" emerge in clusters, and the plot in the film often has "incomplete" and "flaws," which easily loses the integrity and spirit of action expression.</p>
<p>The above are all obvious points. There are many other trivial matters. Because of the limited space, I cannot make a detailed discussion. I will stop my clumsy writing here. I hope that the Chinese film industry will pay more attention! Twenty-first, eleventh, one, in Jiangwan</p>

<h3>A Car Dispute (Mai)</h3>
<p>In general, celebrities are used to riding in their own cars. Once they lose them, they still need that extravagant material enjoyment in their hearts. So what happens when they don't have them? Naturally, they have to hire a taxi. I remember around the end of last month, the big star Zhang Zhiyun rented a car number 18306 from Liyi Taxi Company. She rented it for four consecutive days. On the fifth day (that is, the third of this month), Huang, the Liyi driver, received news of Zhiyun's move, so he drove the car to find her to ask for money. The driver's knowledge was too shallow. He didn't understand the art of collecting debts, and his words inevitably offended Ms. Zhang, so she called two young men in suits and a young lady, and they started a fight in the alley! Who knew that these weak young men in suits were not good at fighting. The driver knocked them into the gutter with three punches and two kicks, getting them covered in sewage. The driver took the opportunity to run to the Shanzhong Road police station to report. The police station immediately sent Detective Zhou, along with the driver, to Ms. Zhang's residence to ask about the situation. The driver said, "Ms. Zhang rented the car for four days and didn't pay a penny, and she kept delaying. She even stopped riding in Liyi's cars and started riding in Yunfei's cars, and she even gathered a crowd to use violence!" Ms. Zhang blamed the driver for being barbaric! Rude! And she lost two diamonds and a watch. The detective asked her, "Since you lost valuable jewelry, of course you have to report it and sue." Ms. Zhang said very generously and frankly, "Diamonds are nothing, a small matter, no need to sue." Since the principal does not care about suing, but returning to the main topic, it is still necessary to collect the debt. Ms. Zhang agreed to have them come to collect it at ten o'clock that night.</p>
<p>At ten o'clock that night, Detective Zhou and Liyi's accountant went to collect the payment. The total amount was 81 yuan and 50 cents. Ms. Zhang gave a discount and paid 64 yuan and 50 cents, thus clearing the matter.</p>
<h3>Don't Need Relatives (Ming)</h3>
<p>Many Hollywood stars often provide their relatives with money or find them jobs, but they always send those relatives to places far away from Hollywood. The farther away, the happier the stars are, because they believe that having relatives is good, but they don't want relatives swarming around them.</p>
<h3>Garbo Was Suddenly Discovered! (Ai)</h3>
<p>Because so many people want to know Greta Garbo's personality and actions, the New York Times sent a special reporter to Europe to find her. Unexpectedly, on the third day of the reporter's ship, a very seductive classical girl was suddenly discovered. She was only wearing shorts and a shirt, slowly strolling on the deck. This was Garbo, who had been searched for everywhere. The whole ship was surprised and stunned! It is strange that Garbo would be so unrestrained.</p>

<h3>The Emperor Receives His Mandate from Heaven (Chen Dabei)</h3>
<p>Confucius said, "To know it is not as good as to love it; to love it is not as good as to delight in it." If we want a unique and correct path in Chinese films, we cannot but hope that there will be more loyal comrades who love and delight in the art of performance. Because the art of performance cannot be learned by reading a few articles of lofty discussions. Therefore, it is not enough to just seek knowledge. One must love and delight in it, learn and practice it constantly, in order to succeed.</p>
<p>"Can screen stars really be made by themselves?" Such a question is often asked in both the United States and China. What is the value of this question?</p>
<p>May I ask, if screen stars are not made by themselves, can it be said that they are made by others? Can it be said that they must be made by heaven?</p>
<p>That's right. Many people do believe that stars are made by heaven. Such people not only think this way about screen stars, but they also think this way about all special people who have achieved something in various careers.</p>
<p>Moreover, this kind of thinking is very suitable for the tastes of a part of the people who have already occupied a position on the screen. They think they are uniquely blessed by heaven. Heaven gave them to be stars, just like the former emperors received their mandate from heaven. They believe that you are ordinary people who are not blessed to receive the mandate of heaven, and you can only look up to their successful performance skills. Of course, you can forget about becoming a star in this life. The honors and rights of stars should be exclusively enjoyed and occupied by their genius forever.</p>
