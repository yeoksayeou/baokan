<h3 id="c1">智利革命與暹羅革命 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>廣泛的經濟恐慌之狂潮。以空前的震撼力搖動資本主義的寳座。以加速的步武。拉着這世界走向一個動邊騷亂的悲境。這已經是任何人所不能否認的事實了。</p>
<p>經濟恐慌愈是尖銳化。深刻化。資本主義社會一切内在的矛盾。即資本主義國家相互間的矛盾。帝國主義國家與殖民地的矛盾。資本主義與社會主義的矛盾。資產階級與無產階級的矛盾。都隨之而整個的爆發。當然。根本的矛盾。仍在於資本主義與社會主義的不容並立。所以在這動盪不安的世界中。一切的動亂。一切的騷擾。以及一切的計劃與籌謀。都是以此一根本矛盾爲其主因。都是伴隨着此一根本矛盾而發動。</p>
<p>法西斯運動的黑潮。已經瀰漫全世界了。這並不是一個怎樣可悲的現象。而恰足以反映出此一根本矛盾之日趨於尖銳化。九一八悲劇的演出。一二八變亂之再起。興登堡的再度當選。希特勒的嶄然顯露其頭角。法總統杜美爾的被刺。日超然内閣的產生。與平沼的崛起。是法西斯運動的勃興。同時亦即此一根本矛盾製痕之擴大。而且不止是法西斯運動而已。改良的社會民主主義。亦必應運而作。竭盡全力的企圖。來緩和這一激烈的爭鬥。而延長資本主義的殘喘。因爲現在是已經到了各種勢力總動員的時候。這次智利與暹羅的革命。恰爲代表此兩種殊途而同歸的運動。前者爲社會民主主義運動。而後者則爲法西斯運動。</p>
<p>智利是南美洲的一個小邦。其全部生產事業及金融財政。都爲英美兩國所把持。故智利亦恰爲一個半殖民地。此次革命運動之所以掀起的原因。當然也不外乎承受世界經濟恐怖的影響。產業凋敝。財政恐慌。失業增加。空軍司令格羅夫之罷免。不過是一根導火線。數小時之内。不流血的革命運動。便告完成。革命政府便告產生。檢閱革命政府的政綱。其最重的是。（一）重要工業及公用事業排除外資。（二）强迫徵收殷富捐。（三）採取農業集圑化。以救濟失業工人。（四）工業社會主義化。然而無論他怎樣堂皇地掛起社會主義的招牌。終於還只是社會民主主義的骨子。因爲建設社會主義社會的第一個條件。即是廢除私有財產制與階級獨裁。然而這兩點是智利新政府的新政綱裏所找不出的。所以智利的革命。終於只是一齣社會民主運動活劇之扮演而已。</p>
<p>至於暹羅。直至現在仍爲一君主國。此次革命運動之爆發。一爲由於經濟凋敝民不聊生。一爲由於政權握於各王公之手。革命之發動者爲軍人。秘密結合之國家主義。及守舊主義的各種圑體。其形式爲一種軍人的革命。革命的結果。只是由君主專制變爲君主立憲。而且舊王仍被舉爲新政府的元首。所謂民黨的領袖。並反對以「革命」的名詞。加入此次政變。由此我們亦可知暹羅這次的所謂革命。亦不過只是法西斯運動的一般惡流。</p>
<p>在經濟恐慌的狂潮之下。即如智利暹羅等小邦。其騷擾動亂。亦不可避免。從可知這世界局勢的不安。已是不可避免的事。無論法西斯運動與社會民主運動怎樣地高漲。怎樣地盛極一時。然而終是從舊社會到新會的一種必然的過程而已。</p>

<h3 id="c113">敎部令辦短期義敎 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>前日敎部令各省市舉辦義敎以及第一期義務敎育實施辦法已誌昨報、兹再將「短期義務敎育實施辦法大綱」及部令全文分别照載如下、聞該項令文由敎部要員五人之起草、並一再修正、始經判行、該部之重視義敎於此可見、令云查我國自清季以來、有識之士咸知敎育普及之必要、提倡義務敎育、不遺餘力、本黨政綱亦有「厲行敎育普及」之規定、訓政時期約法更有「已逹學齡之兒童、應一律受義務敎育」之專條、良以我國國民程度糼稚、無論對外欲與國民程度較高之國家、並　齊驅、即對内欲實行最低限度之地方自治、亦非厲行義務敎育力圖敎育普及不爲功、</p>
<p>顧廿餘年來、提倡推行、不謂不力、其年限惟以初級小學四年爲準、亦不謂不簡單易行、然徵諸事實、十八年度全國初等敎育統計、入學兒童、僅佔學齡兒童百分之十七距敎育普及之期、　乎尙遠、其所以經時久用力多而獲效甚鮮者、則以四年義務敎育所需經費以萬萬計、所需敎員以百萬計、猶與國家財力及現有師資之實際狀况、相差太鉅、</p>
<p>本部受命黨國急圖義務敎育之實施、爲適應環境推行便利起見、特訂定短期義務敎育實施辦法及第一期實施義務敎育辦法大綱兩種、前者惟以一年爲期、用以敎育十足歲至十六足歲之年長失學兒童、故名短期義務敎育後者仍以四年爲期、與向所提倡推行者初無二致、兩辦法同時頒發俾各省縣市及行政院直轄市區、各按其經費師資之多寡、同時並舉、或先辦短期義務敎育、以期速效、</p>
<p>論經費、短期義務敎育以一敎員於上下午晚間分敎年長失學兒童三班、各予以兩小時之敎育、以每班四十人計、一年得畢業兒童百二十人、與以三個敎員對初級小學兒童二班、予以全日之敎育、亦以每班四十人計、四年得畢業兒童八十人者相較、其所需經費之多寡、不啻一與十八之比也、論師資、短期義務敎育、其課程僅爲識字及淺易算術敎學至易稍知書算者優爲之、與初級小學課程繁複、敎學不易、非曾受師範專業訓練不能勝任者相較、其物色師資之難易又不可同日而語也、經費旣省、師資亦易得、程度雖淺而欲求普及、自非難事、</p>
<p>其限於財力僅辦短期義務敎育之區、十足歲以下之學齡兒童、雖不能增加其入學機會、然以現時國民經濟力之薄弱、能遣子弟受满四年義務敎育者、不過十之一二、縱令初級小學林立、彼等固皆無力入學者也、况年齡較長、學習能力較富一年之效果、有時或竟與六歲入學受四年敎育者、相差無幾、果能實施短期義務敎育、俾全國所有十足歲以上之失學兒童、人人得受一年之敎育、其增加國民程度效率之大更不待言、並世各國、義務敎育年限、漸見延長、而我國則轉由四年縮爲一年、就表面觀之、一似與人異趣、不進反退、然就實際而言、以我國經費師資之缺乏、非是無由促進敎育之普及、普之貧無立　之子、見他人廣厦萬間、　羡無已、然與其希冀萬一、因循坐誤、何如結編荆、可蔽風雨、將來國民程度逐漸增高、社會經濟即與之俱上、至是時經費師資、兩得解决、不得四年義務敎育可望普及、即引而長之六年八年以至十餘年、駕各國而上之、亦非不可能之事也、</p>
<p>辦法初定、深恐事屬獨創、國人不明斯意　或懷疑義甚至奉行不力貽誤大計、特將短期義務敎育之用意、反復申說、冀共了解、</p>
<p>兹將該兩項辦法隨令檢發、仰該廳即自二十一年度起參酌地方情形、切實遵照辦理、其不能同時並辦第一期實施義務敎育者、應儘先遵照短期義務敎育辦法辦理並仰儘文到一月内、擬具具體計劃、呈報備案、依限實行、勿稍觀望、是爲至要、此令、計發短期義務敎育實施辦法及第一期實施義務敎育辦法大綱各兩份、（第一期義敎辦法已誌昨報）</p>

<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>三十九細想起來眞好笑。同是一部論語，從前那樣讀法覺得聖人的書没有没有一句錯，現在換个法子讀便覺得句句有重新估價之必要。我是我是懊悔極了，爲什麽應該懷疑的地方我乃絲毫無疑？然而不幸中之幸中之大幸我於今却得着朱先生之指點，從此對於古人的書連一一句也不使他輕易放過。我記得有一個人說過。：『學貴知疑：：大疑則大進：小疑則小進：不疑則不進。」這個疑字我當重用他用他。</p>
<p>我今次讀倫語讀到公山不擾以費畔一段是忍不住笑了。當孔孔子想去勾結叛逆的時候，子路不歡喜，孔子說：「我又不是一個一個葫蘆，豈能掛在這兒不吃飯？」你旣知道要吃飯，爲什麽又說又說：「君子謀道不謀食」呢？</p>
<p>四十阿羊跑來呌我到門口去輕輕的告訴我：『他們講你們請來的宋先先生没有本事，在城裏考背榜的。』我追問他那裏聽來的，他說說是王二嫂子聽人說的。我追去問王二嫂子，她說是裁縫司務老老錢說的。我便去問老錢，老錢說是吳木匠傳來的。等我追到吳吳木匠那兒，詳細盤問了一下，纔知道這風聲是磚匠老許造出來來的。他還在這裏搗亂！</p>
<p>我追到了謠言的根源，就回到廟中，想告訴朱先生。但是我怎　我怎麽能夠唐突？我思來想去，正不知如何進言。小弟弟忽然跑跑來，毫不隠藏的對朱先生說：「哥哥！村裏人講你在城裏考背背榜，又說什麽倒數第一。「天眞爛漫的小弟弟，說話竟這樣不知不知輕重嗎？我爲什麽没有他的爽直與勇敢？他是有什麽話。應應該說的他都說了。</p>
<p>『這呈磚匠老許造的謠言，我已經查明白了』小弟弟才說完完就我說明謠言的來歷，爲的是本給朱先生知道老許故意造謠使使他心裏可以安慰些。</p>
<p>朱先生說：『老許不是造謠。我在城裏過考的確是背榜倒數數第一是一點也不錯。他大槪是實地調查來的。』</p>

<h3 id="c127">悟 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>無論科學的，哲學的，文學的，全在一個悟字上用功夫。什麽呌做悟？便是從那極平常的材料，悟出一種新闢的蹊徑。</p>
<p>見果落，悟吸力；見壼沸，悟汽機；這般驚天動地的神悟，値得世人永遠紀念！</p>
<p>「頻呼小玉緣何事？只要檀郎認得聲。」這是香艷的詩句；但是，有一位古德，從這兩句中參破了禪機。</p>
<p>「怎當他臨去秋波那一轉」。這是西廂記中的曲文；但是，載入弘覺國師的語錄中，也從這一句參破了禪機。</p>
<p>所以，公孫大娘舞劍器，善書者便悟出用筆的方法；庖丁解十二年，芒刃不鈍，養生者便悟出卻病的秘訣；只要善悟，無論什麽事物，總可以悟出一種新生命。</p>
<p>文選上有兩句雋語：「石韞玉而山輝。川含珠而水媚」。有人從這兩句上悟出養生的道理。每見年青的人，往往肉不掩骨，血不澤膚；這是什麽道理？這是石不韞玉，川不含珠，當然山失其輝，川失其媚了。</p>
<p>桐城張文瑞公聽訓齋語，略謂：蘭蕙芍藥的蒂間，必有露珠一點；若此露點爲蟲蟻所食，花便萎了。清晨細看初出土的荀，必有露珠數點在其末，日出，露便歛而歸根，夕則復上。人的元氣，也和露珠一般；云云。</p>
<p>青年的男女啊！在這肉的潮流中，須得自有把握，保守你們的露珠，不要被那蟲蟻食去，才是道理。每在此心捉摸不定時，請你們連誦｜石韞玉而山輝，川含珠而水媚；念到此心有了把握時，才休。</p>
<h3 id="c128">日本陸軍省指導之下的「紙牌戲」 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 有心</p>
<p>讀者看到這紙牌戲三字，恐怕就要想到鄉下人賭博的紙牌，或者是舶來品的撲克，但是日本的紙牌戲，可不是那個東西了。</p>
<p>日本原來的兩種紙牌戲，一種是呌「花札」，大小同撲克相仿，上面寫着字，畫着花，大槪是人家女孩兒的玩品。另一種是街頭巷尾賣糖菓的騙小孩子的紙牌，上面畫着打架的人啦，或是動物之類的東西，他把鈴一搖，聚集了許多小孩子，他們都看着畫片兒，聽他講畫片裏的故事，講一張，換一張，到了那麽光景，他拿出糖來向孩子賣，孩子們也就嘴裏銜着糖聽他講。他也就購了錢。</p>
<p>日本陸軍省指導之下的這一種紙牌戲同第二種差不多、但性質就不同了。這種紙牌上畫的是在東三省或者上海戰死的兵士，與「支那人」的兇樣和醜樣，講的也就是某某軍曹的勇敢殺敵，榮譽戰死，和「支那人」的怎麽兇暴，無理，可殺！日本人要愛國，要準備作戰等等。日本軍部對於這一種營業的人切實的加以指導與統制。現計東京一處有二千人做這個營業的，全國合計有兩萬人以上。日本國的野心，日本軍部（軍閥的代表機關）的企圖，也就可想而知了。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 王翼吾</p>
<p>煙這樣東西，現在已普及於全世界，吸的人很多了。可是它的歷史，並不長遠，也和鴉片一樣的開始發見於明代，也同樣的不是國產。最初是由呂宋傅入中國，末後中國纔種植起來，漸漸的遍於各省，它又名淡巴菰，又呌烟草，高三尺許，開石青色的花，其形像一個漏斗，製烟却用葉子，所以通常又稱爲烟草，能製成種種不同的烟。現在最流行的捲烟，就是種種之一。前日偶然和友人某君談起，却聽得一個故事，說是烟這樣東西，不錯是明代纔有的。但並非由外國傳入，那時有一個石姓男子，和一個馬姓女子締婚，未及親迎，馬忽逝世，石非常悲痛，立誓終身不娶，朝夕哭於馬墓，不論風霜雨雪，從不間斷，墓上竟生出一種草來，就像種的烟一樣，那時石自然不知道是烟，但覺得有一股異香，這天，他因爲悲痛過度，陡然頭眩腹痛，倒身墓前，不能起立，隨手採了一葉，塞在鼻孔裏，不多一會頭竟不眩，腹也不痛，反而神清氣爽，被旁人知道了，都說是他的血淚所化，凡有疾病，採一葉當藥吃，無不立愈，於是輾轉傳說，大家都看作仙草。把它種植起來，漸種漸廣，便成爲烟草，當初鴉片也是非常貴重的，暹羅曾作爲貢品，只有皇帝享用，明神宗最愛它，便吸上了癮，等到中國自已種植，極　的平民化起來，倒變成洪水猛獸了。烟草有麻醉性，能解疲勞，所以吸的人更普遍得快，其實，它也是毒物，含有尼古丁毒質，頗礙衛生，除我國是絶對的不禁外，各國對於未成年的人，是有禁令的。</p>

<p>二十年春，吾國畫家劉海粟受德國佛蘭克府中國學院之聘，講演中國畫學，並即在佛府美術館舉行中國現代畫展，六月又移至海台堡展覽，一時影響之巨，非意料所及。蓋是年春初，適日本人曾在柏林舉行，大規模之展覽造製，所以歐人視之反覺東方藝術徒事皮毛之歐化而未見特長。及見中國現代畫展，乃訝賞不已，蓋素樸天趣不事矯飾，與日人之作僞心勞，自不可同日而語也。使館見德報騰載亦感有在柏林舉行中國現代畫展之必要，乃電促劉氏赴柏林，爰正式與普魯士美術院，東方藝術會各機關談判，並疊與東方學者柏林大學敎授，寇美爾，休雷，美術院副院長阿末而道夫敎授，工科大學敎授巴爾希門等詳細探討，最後由使館正式與德方訂定於一九三四年二月舉行，以普魯士美術院爲展覽地址，並推舉德方委員十人：德國外交部代表一人，德國東方藝術協會長前德國駐日大使沙爾武博士，德國東方藝術協會副會長工學博士克倫配雷，德國東方藝術協會秘書長東方博物館館長柏林大學敎授寇美稱博士，德國東方藝術協會副秘書長國家博物館主任孔威廉，柏林工業大學敎授政府建築顧問白舒孟，國家美術圖書館館長柏林大學敎授克拉愁博士，德國東方藝術協會會計主任銀思伯博士，德國東方藝術協會會計副主任伯爵海豆博士，普魯士美術院秘書長柏林大學敎授阿末而道夫博士。</p>

<p>據紐約傳來的消息，說是有位聲學專家克萊氏Mr·rayKelley，他在徵求一對善於接吻的青年男女，别的人才，徵求本無足爲奇，但徵求接吻的人才，我們却從來没有聽見過，他徵求這種人才，就在攝製一幕有聲影片，他的徵求標準，就在這對男女能夠在接吻的時候，祇有兩對嘴唇相接觸，而這時嘴唇接觸的聲音，由無線電收入，在藝術方面說，克萊氏的目的，就在研究接吻的聲音，當他在研究的时候，曾用枳櫟樹的瓶塞一個，在一塊塗着松脂的玻璃上磨擦，想用以代接吻的聲音，但所發的聲音，完全和接吻不同，所以他不能不徵求一對善於接吻的青年男女呢。</p>

<p>有一個五十多歲的山東人站在地室的鐵門口招攬人去游覧。花了三張「毛票」呌他作嚮導。從石級上一跨下地室，就覺得身上冷颺颺地如入深秋。一道狹長的水門汀造成的甬道裏，黑黝黝地不辨五指，地上又是濕漉漉的，若非地點起一隻燈籠，和一隻小風燈來照着，我們眞是寸步難移呢。他一面走着，一面這間那間這樣那樣指點給我們聽。在傷兵室的左壁上，印着許多血的手印，這就是日軍攻這砲台時德國的傷兵印在上面的。不知這些傷兵是否到底死在這陰森凄凉的地下室裏，或者竟能安然退出，回到他們的故國，重度那和平的歲月，這些事已經無從訽問，恐怕連那「嚮導」也不會知道的了。又過去有一間，據他說是作戰時德僑婦孺避難的所在，因爲那時砲台周圍彈如雨下，住在外面是危險萬分。於是一幅母子相擁，　觫恐怖的慘象，又立時湧現於我的腦際，身經閘北戰禍恰如驚弓之烏的我，在這裏又不期然而渾身戰慄了！</p>

<p>走進了日本浴堂，男女就分道各自一門而入。毛巾和胰子是要自已帶去的。先付了賬（每個人只要六分）然後去洗浴。裏面有池子，先用盆舀水將全身擦個乾凈之後，再到池子裏浸一浸，使垢污完全去掉，就行了。</p>

<p>在裏銅砂撞碰</p>
<p>昨還上海修理</p>
<p>本埠海昌公司上海營口班輪海平號、由滬赴牛莊、行至吳淞口外裏洞砂燈船（距上海約六十海哩）、被日清公司北洋班輪唐山丸撞壞、損失頗巨、肇禍之責、全在日輪、兹經記者調查此事詳情、分記如下</p>
<p>肇禍眞相　海平輪在滬裝載貨物旅客、於二十五日下午四時、開往營口、當夜八時二十八分、駛近裏銅砂燈船之際、海平向導、爲東南向又二分一的南、依準航船進行、突然對面有來船一艘、初見綠燈、至八時三十分、又續見來船一隻、係現紅燈、海平輪再改向道爲東南東又四分之一之東Ｓ·ＥＩＥ１／４Ｅ、顯示綠燈之船、拉汽笛一聲、與顯紅燈之船、乃一先一後、迎面而行、海平輪爲避免肇禍、向九段燈船之邊靠側而行、乃拉汽笛二聲、其時一船已先過去、而顯紅燈之船、爲日清公司唐山丸、從天津經青島至上海、此時亦答兩回聲、表示經過右側、海平即向左讓、八時四十分、唐山丸顯紅燈、詎一分鐘後、唐山丸紅綠燈全見、顯係其船身向海平輪矣、此時海平之左、已緊靠燈船、無可再讓、霎時間唐山丸船頭、已猛撞入海平右舷矣、</p>
<p>撞壞情形　海平輪當時退無可退、而唐山丸船頭、不向右偏、而轉左向、遂致相撞、海平輪第三貨艙外舷右側、受唐山丸船頭猛撞、鐵板盡毁、製成大洞一個、幸而被撞處、尙在水綫以上、故海水雖猛冲而進、猶不致即行下沉、苟損在水綫以下、則早没於海底矣、第三艙内裝貨甚多、均爲冲進之水浸漬、損失頗巨、唐山丸船頭、亦遭撞壞、該輪肇禍以後、便不顧一切、駛行來滬、</p>
<p>自行擱淺　海平被撞後、深恐重儎進水、不勝支持、或發生意外、遂於被撞後二十分鐘内、由該輪船主自行將海平輪開到燈船附近的淺灘上擱住、以免意外而示鄭重、當經輪主設法先將三艙積水抽去若干、一面電滬報告、以損壞過重、殊難長途航行、直至昨日上午、始乘　潮之際、將海平駛出淺灘、開還上海、從事檢騐修理、並與日商交涉、</p>
<p>回滬修理　海平輪昨日已由裏銅砂九段燈船處、開還上海、即在涌口内第二十五·二十六·號河筒停泊、由船主報告公司及海關、先派員到輪檢騐損壞之處、並擬將三艙之貨卸出、然後將破洞修理、船上旅客、祇得上陸改乘他輪、一面向日清交涉、損失數目、尙未查明、惟損壞船貨兩項、爲數甚巨、該輪爲二千三百六十噸、係一八九七年所造、</p>

<p>常州人趙錫林、前在原籍公安局充當偵緝員、自辭職後、來滬住居楊樹浦路安德里二十四號、在申新第九紗廠爲稽查、本月十三號晚十時五分、偕妾南京婦人姜氏出外、行經楊樹浦萬興坊附近、被仇人開槍、擊傷要害、當經中西捕查見、將其車送同仁醫院、延至翌日午後一時許、</p>
<p>傷重殞命　業由特院騐訊各情已誌報端、前日、由楊樹浦捕房華探目沈禹舟偵悉住居楊樹浦路留春坊二十八號門牌之無錫人徐阿二、私藏軍火、且對於趙案頗有嫌疑、遂協同西探馳往搜查軍火無着、詰據徐供、有毛瑟槍一支、藏於眉州路無號平房伊叔徐步月家、該探復往該屋床下、在網籃内抄出第八三七一號</p>
<p>毛瑟手槍　一支、彈壳一只、但徐步月已聞風逃避、即往安德里、將趙姜氏逮捕、昨晨、解送第一特區地方法院高一庭、首由捕房律師張天蔭陳述案情、謂被告等對於趙錫林被人槍殺案、有重大嫌疑、被告趙姜氏係趙錫林之第四妾、查得與徐阿二有</p>
<p>姘識關係　但趙死後有自衛手槍一支、而無工部局執照者、由趙姜氏交徐阿二轉藏在眉州路伊叔徐步月處、業已查獲、捕房查得尙有手槍一支、於此案發生之翌日、交常州公安局偵緝員劉順年取去、因本案趙錫林被人槍殺處、捕房探員在發生地點、</p>
<p>獲子彈壳　數枚、是以請庭上公函致常州縣公安局、着偵緝員劉順年將交伊之手槍一支、須在下次開庭時帶案、俾得研究云云、路將抄獲之毛瑟槍一支呈察、訊之趙姜氏供、三十三歲、與趙錫林姘識、已有四載、是晚、我與錫林出外、同行至楊樹浦路萬興坊口、忽聞搶聲一響、我即向天而望、錫林則向地而視、不見踪跡、俄頃、忽有一人從我肩際開槍、錫林被</p>
<p>擊中要害　倒地、我乃回首、見二人飛奔而逃、是時適有一巡捕汽車到來、將我與錫林帶　捕房、略詰一過、將傷者送醫院療治、我遂回家、翌日午後、錫林因傷重死於醫院、伊之仇人頗多、去年有綁匪首領常州人寗浩明、亦曾開槍暗殺、幸未射中、但當時開槍者</p>

<p>就職情形　到有實業部代表監誓員何炳賢·公安局長温應星·江海關監督唐海安·航政局長何瀚瀾·商標局長何焯賢·社會局代表王德發·及各圑體代表來賓二百餘人、范氏由監誓員監誓下正式宣誓就職、繼由温應星李徵五等致詞、禮成攝影用點散會、</p>
<p>監誓訓詞　我們大家都知道在這地球之上、水界的面積、較陸地的面積還大還廣闊、所以水裏面的物產、當然是很豐富的、據最近生物學家的考據調查、水產中魚類、共有三萬六千五百多種、哺乳動物類、共有二千五百種、爬蟲類共有三千多種、此外還有甲殼類·海藻類·等等、水產的類目旣有這樣的多、水裏面的富源、當然也是很可觀的了、所以現代國家、除開發陸地上的富源以外、眼光一直注意到水裏去、我們東鄰野心勃勃的日本、在數十年前、即着手注重到水產的經營、設立漁業學校、奬勵撈漁事業、改良漁獲的器具之製造、到了現在、日本已變成一個優越的水產國家了、說到我們中國、數千年來、政府及人民都不知力圖水中的厚利、漁法還是守舊、漁具没有改良、沿海一帶之漁民、一方受海盗之壓迫、一方復有外國漁船之侵入、以致漁業成了奄奄待斃的垂死狀態、以我國海岸綫之長、水產物之富、眼睜了地把水產事業放棄、實在是最堪痛心的一件事、據最近調查、我國每年還要由外國（即日本等國）輸入水產物品、價値一億四千萬元之巨、自已有天賜的水產不知撈取、不知利用、反要利權外溢、其於國計民生、對外貿易、損失如是之大、眞是令人萬分痛心、古人說、「貨惡其棄於地、」現在我們可以說、「貨惡其棄於水」了、國民政府有鑒於此、所以特劃定我國沿海爲四漁區、每區設一漁業管理局、專司維護漁民及巡緝海匪之責、現在江浙區漁業管理局業已成立、今天又是范局長宣誓就職日子、范局長學有專長、兄弟深信范局長如能根據本部漁業行政計劃、對於漁民之保護、努力施行、庶幾乎江浙沿途一帶之水產事業、日漸發逹、利權不至外溢、這就是兄弟私心所願望、也就是政府所期望的、</p>

<p>— 高潛</p>
<p>創造相對論的愛因斯坦氏，主張空間是彎曲的，有限的，光綫一直發出去，可以兜一大圈子走回來。他的學說，全世界爲之震動。</p>
<p>可是現在。愛因斯坦氏已經放棄他的彎曲空間的觀念了。</p>
<p>據愛氏的意見，空間大槪是無限的，三度的，光綫一直發出去不會回來，和歷來科學家所假設的相同。不過此種觀念的變動對於相對論的眞實性還是毫無影響。</p>
<p>愛氏所以放棄他的彎曲空間觀念，有幾種原因。</p>
<p>第一，由威爾遜山天文台觀測的結果，遠處星雲的光帶向紅端移動、星雲越遠，移動越大，這便是證明宇宙刻刻在膨　，膨　的速率，異常驚人，每秒鐘有十五萬英里！愛氏從前以爲空間是有定限的，所以他爲完成其學說，假定空間是彎曲的，至於這膨　空間，他却絶未想到。</p>
<p>第二，德國苟庭根大學海克門博士已經證明膨　的空間可以有物質在内，而且仍爲歐几里得式。由此假設，愛氏遂放棄他的彎曲空間主張。</p>
<p>愛氏依此新觀念，用他相對論中的方程式，可以算出空間的密度。不過這種密度却小得出乎我們意想之外。大槪六十倍地球直徑的大空球中，平均不過有一磅物質。空間刻刻在膨大，所以密度還是一天天的減小。</p>

<h3 id="c202">搶油主 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>在馬路的上面，你如果看見一排舊屋的外面，新打了一行竹籬笆，那麽要拆屋了；經過了相當的時期以後，竹籬笆拆掉以後，一排的新屋，自會突然的現露於你的眼簾之前。新屋自然有新的房客，這屋倘靠近馬路，那麽接着便會有許多的店新開了。</p>
<p>新開店，不拘那一行，第一天賣出去的東西，總會比老店便宜了些，雖然他們不見得自願蝕本，但那天不能賺到錢，却可以斷定的。因此，新開的店，第一天的營業，總是非常的熱閙，而所有的夥友，總是忙得不亦樂乎，而要請許多人來帮忙呢。</p>
<p>據說新開店有規矩，第一個人，手裏拿了一個紅紙包，裏面包着很少的錢，要買很値價的東西，店裏的朋友，也不作興拒絶他，所以二角錢買着一條金鼠牌香烟，四角錢買着一隻火腿，：：：：：等，笑話，在新開店的第一天，我們時常有得聽到的。</p>
<p>不過你要到新聞的店裏，第一個走進店門，而買到大便宜而特便宜的東西，那非得要隔夜起來，守候在店門口不可。不信，你看當新開的門，還没有除掉的時候，外面已守了不少的顧客了。第一批的人，都在黑夜中起早，預備來塌便宜貨。但要想第一個跑進店門，你還要非有氣力不可，否則在人叢中，要被人擠你出去的，而你也老是不能擠進人圍。</p>
<p>到新開店去買便宜貨，呌搶油主，我們鄉下也有這種規矩。一個鎭上新開了一片店，四鄉的人們，都來搶油主，他們離鎭有不少的路，但天還没有亮就守在門口，可知他們是隔夜起來。記得小時候我家的對面，新開一片肉莊，有一個朋友，隔夜就睡在門口，第二天肉莊開門，他第一個進去，兩角錢買到一隻猪腿。諸如此類的笑話，時常有得聽見的。</p>
<p>在上海，一有了新開店，老娘姨告訴老太太，小大姐告訴老媽子，汽車夫告訴大少爺，小弟弟小妹妹告訴他們的媽媽，消息會很快的傳佈開來；所以到了開市的一天，顧客總是熱閙得再熱閙没有了。</p>
<p>中國的商人，尤其是上海，妬忌心分外的重，有一家買便宜貨，同行便會立刻和他們競爭。新開店又何嘗不是如此有了一家新開店，在同一的馬路上，同行的店家，也會掛燈結彩，吹着軍樂而大買其便宜貨。最近，我們新閘路新開了一家藥店，附近的同業，也照樣掛燈結彩買便宜貨，但顧客却寥寥無幾，没有别種店來得熱閙，吃藥，本來是倒霉的事，不生病誰去搶油主。同時，我更聯想到新開了棺材店，也許没有人去塌便宜貨的。</p>

<h3 id="c203">畢業生的出路 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 白水</p>
<p>忙於考畢業試的Ｃ君，前晚才到我家裏坐談，自然我少不了恭賀他的話；我問他說：</p>
<p>「四年大學生活，今天可算結束了！那是你最得意的日子吧！」</p>
<p>「那裏話，捱過了四年，結束一個段落罷了！」他說。</p>
<p>「那末到東洋去？抑或西洋去？」我再問他說。</p>
<p>「談何容易，莫說要出洋留學去，就是目前的出路，也没有辦法呢！」他說。</p>
<p>「那是你客氣的話吧，」我瞧了他一眼，帶着一點似信非信的態度，再向他問着。</p>
<p>於是他沉默了一回，接着皺了額頭，莊重地答我說：</p>
<p>「唉！老同學，客氣話不用說吧！别的不講，像我們這樣的人家，得到大學畢業，已經費盡了九牛二虎之力了！還想到出洋嗎？夢想吧！你瞧，最近Ｋ同學到Ｍ城去了，聽說他的親眷馬上已代他找到一席優差，這去是履新吧！Ｌ同學也到Ｋ城去了，祇是我一個人，還是徘徊於十字街頭：前天在路上碰着一位五年不見的老同學Ｗ君，他在ＸＸ軍政治部當主任的，最近要開到Ｆ省剿匪去，在那裏或許有條出路未定？不過天生我的性情，十分孤僻，一方面我捱不慣軍隊裏的生活，一方面我也不願踏進有槍階級裏：但是不去的話，這衣食住幾大問題，又不能解决，唉！眞是悶煞呀！</p>
<p>「他停頓了一回，繼續向我說：現在，我悔恨我讀書了！如查父母不敎我讀書，像我伯父的兒子一樣，天天在家裏耕耕田，種種蔬菜，好不快樂：然我呢？每年費了八百塊袁頭，耗了許多寳貴光陰，結果反找不到一條出路，豈不是笑話？唉！歸根到底都是社會環境的不良！使到我們畢業生都閙着失業恐慌呢！」</p>
<p>我聽了這一番話，心裏自然表現着十分同情；其實，現在中國社會上感着Ｃ君同樣的痛苦，不知幾許人？我想；在這個政治不上軌道的社會當中·用人漫無標準，任你是如何的眞才實學，没有那些政治舞臺的要角來提拔你，恐怕埋没了幾十年，還不能抬頭呢！唉！「畢業生的出路」</p>

<h3 id="c204">鴉片，麻雀和狂宴 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 號鶑</p>
<p>一個狹隘而低小得可憐的寳山城，｜我們的故鄉，在一月以前還落在敵人的衣袋裏；現在，我們總算又獲得了自由進出以及可以安居在被砲彈轟穿的自已的破屋裏了。</p>
<p>屋子裏是空無所有，要找一雙筷和一隻破的食碗簡直是夢想。有的是堆在牆外的高高的垃圾，以及在院子的草堆中的幾册「敵人」所抛棄的雜誌。</p>
<p>我好奇的拾起了那册有五百多頁日文雜誌，一頁一頁的翻過去，不消說。裏面各項豐富的材料和多量的挿國在中國任何一本上號的雜誌上是找不到的，特别是關於中國東三省的研究，在另一方面，那雜誌上刋登着很多的譏諷中國的挿圖，雖然我不懂日文而不能完全看懂這爲挿圖作註解的文字，但在圖上所指示我的，以及在日文中偶有的幾個漢字，已很夠供給一個爲離亂而奔疲者的刺激！</p>
<p>我們只消揀一幅來說說：那題目是『支那Ｙ面子（體面』上面繪着一個十足的中國老紳土模樣的人，瓜皮小帽和老光眼鏡是不缺少的，穿了龐大的黑馬褂，駄起了背脊，相了手伏在桌子上，面前安放了三件不可缺少的生活原料：烟槍，麻雀牌和大魚。</p>
<p>在一段短短的說明挿圖的文字裏，還可以零零碎碎的找到這幾句：『：：大官：：一日：：少：：兩三回宴會。』『麻雀：：鴉片：：亦彼等：：生活的重要分子：：』</p>
<p>多漂亮的中國人的面子！這裏，夠我們深思！</p>
<p>這的的確確是事實；第一，麻雀深入中國民間的力量，比丹麥的敎育還普及。無論不識字的婦人，發育未全的孩子，高貴（！）的官僚，低卑（！）的車夫，都會拉上四個同伴又他四圈。這一種普遍的賭具，非但成了交際的妙品，和消閒的工具，而在一般有閒階級中間差不多成了和衣食住同樣重要的生活條件了！第二，鴉片在中國雖不及麻雀之普及，但吸食者的總數，統計起來一定巨大的會使人吃驚，即以我們人數五六千的寳山城而言，「燕子窠」已有四十餘處之多，其他自吸自燒者尙不在内，每個『燕子窠』的常顧客平均十人，其數已有四五百了！寳山如此，其他如四川，安徽，陜西，河北，福建等勒種罌粟之處，連婦人孺子也有吸食的，那寳山的成績又瞠乎其後了！第三，關於大魚大肉的宴會的話，報紙上每天登載着的官吏的東請客西設宴，以及資本家的狂飲濫吃，眞會使人把一切的困厄和恥辱的遭遇忘去。一般「政治狂」的小政客，下級官吏，也往往以請客（當然是豐　美　）爲進身之階或攏絡的手段的，其他如民間的婚喪喜慶，也總是辦起幾桌或幾十桌的盛席，招致親戚朋友們來大嚼一頓。這一切，日本人所譏諷我們的：以吸鴉片又麻雀辦大魚大肉的宴會引爲體面的一會事，我們還有申辯的餘地嗎？</p>
<p>朋友！大家撾過這時代没有？瞧過眼前的環境没有？我們能不能永遠這樣下去？</p>

<h3 id="c205">讀完了「路」 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴夢</p>
<p>幾日的黃梅苦雨，在苦悶之中我把矛盾的「路」讀完了。矛盾從前一向在小說月報裏做海外文壇消息，那時候，大家都不知道他是中國的大天才。後來因爲參加政治運動，見到的事情是很多很多，於是一切的革命變態事實，都成了他的複雜的題材。及至他的三部曲也完成了，文壇才衆口同聲的驚歎他的描寫手腕。</p>
<p>我的哥哥旣澄同他很熟，從前一起在商務印書館同事，後來又在文學研究會共同負責編文學旬刋。據他說：「矛盾寫小說寫得如此有力，大一半是受了法國文學家莫泊桑氏的影響」。這話我很相信，我想矛盾自已也會承認這句話</p>
<p>「路」，也是矛盾近作之一種，寫得不如「幻滅」，「動搖」，「追求」深刻。即材料亦不如三部曲的豐富動人。不過在許許多多白白蹧蹋紙張和油墨的作品比起來，「路」也還算是充値得出版的一部好小說。在徬徨不可終日的青年意識中，他仍然抓住了時代的靈魂，他替許些青年人在條條死路之間找出路！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chilean Revolution and Siamese Revolution <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The raging tide of widespread economic panic is shaking the throne of capitalism with unprecedented force, dragging the world towards a tragic state of turbulent chaos with accelerating strides. This is already an undeniable fact for anyone.</p>
<p>The more acute and profound the economic panic becomes, the more the inherent contradictions within capitalist society, such as the contradictions between capitalist nations, between imperialist nations and colonies, between capitalism and socialism, and between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, will erupt entirely. Of course, the fundamental contradiction remains the irreconcilability between capitalism and socialism. Therefore, in this turbulent world, all upheavals, all disturbances, and all plans and schemes are primarily caused by this fundamental contradiction and are initiated alongside it.</p>
<p>The black tide of the fascist movement has already spread throughout the world. This is not so much a deplorable phenomenon as it is a reflection of the increasing acuteness of this fundamental contradiction. The performance of the September 18th tragedy, the resurgence of the January 28th incident, Hindenburg's re-election, Hitler's sudden emergence, the assassination of French President Doumer, and the formation of the ultra-nationalist cabinet in Japan and the rise of Hiranuma are all signs of the burgeoning of the fascist movement and the widening of the rift caused by this fundamental contradiction. Moreover, it is not only the fascist movement; reformist social democracy will also inevitably arise, making every effort to mitigate this fierce struggle and prolong the dying breaths of capitalism. Because now is the time for the total mobilization of various forces. The revolutions in Chile and Siam represent these two divergent but ultimately converging movements. The former is a social democratic movement, while the latter is a fascist movement.</p>
<p>Chile is a small country in South America, whose entire production and financial affairs are controlled by the United Kingdom and the United States. Thus, Chile is a semi-colony. The reason for the outbreak of this revolutionary movement is, of course, none other than the impact of the global economic terror. The decline of industry, financial panic, and increasing unemployment, and the dismissal of Air Force Commander Grove, were merely the fuse. Within a few hours, the bloodless revolution was completed, and a revolutionary government was formed. Examining the program of the revolutionary government, the most important points are: (1) excluding foreign capital from important industries and public utilities; (2) imposing forced contributions on the wealthy; (3) adopting agricultural collectivization to relieve unemployed workers; and (4) industrial socialism. However, no matter how grandly it displays the banner of socialism, it is ultimately just the essence of social democracy. Because the first condition for building a socialist society is the abolition of private property and class dictatorship, but these two points cannot be found in the new program of the Chilean government. Therefore, the Chilean revolution is ultimately just a performance of a social democratic drama.</p>
<p>As for Siam, it is still a monarchy to this day. The outbreak of this revolutionary movement was due to economic decline and popular discontent, and because political power was held by various royal princes. The initiators of the revolution were soldiers, secretly combined nationalist and conservative groups. Its form was a military revolution. The result of the revolution was simply a change from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy, and the old king was still elected as the head of the new government. The so-called leaders of the People's Party even opposed including the term "revolution" in this coup. From this, we can also see that the so-called revolution in Siam is just a common evil current of the fascist movement.</p>
<p>Under the raging tide of economic panic, even small countries like Chile and Siam cannot avoid disturbances and unrest. From this, we can see that the instability of the world situation is already unavoidable. No matter how high the fascist movement and the social democratic movement rise, and how prosperous they may be for a time, they are ultimately just a necessary process from the old society to the new society.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Sun Ke arrived in Hong Kong on the 25th morning. The attack on Qiongzhou broke out on the same day. Chen Zhangfu ordered Chen Hanguang, Zhang Wentao, Liang Guowu, and other troops on the 25th to take more than a hundred civilian boats from Xuwen, towed by warships, to attack Xiuying Fort. He also sent seven planes to bomb Fuan, Hairui, and other ships in Haikou. The ships returned fire with anti-aircraft guns. Xiuying Fort recently purchased two new cannons by Chen Ce, which were quite sharp. It had not been captured by the 26th. At the same time, the Qiongzhou Navy also sent planes to bomb Xuwen. It is said that there are seven planes in Qiongzhou. The battle was still fierce on the 26th. Chen Jitang dispatched the Guangjin, Jianru, Haihu, Haiwei, Haizhou, and other ships sent to Leizhou on the 25th at noon, sailing close to the shore. Chen Ce used the Zhongshan ship to patrol the Lingdingyang. Aircraft such as Fuan and Hairui guarded Qiongyai. About ten small ships that escaped from Tangjiawan have all come to Hong Kong for temporary shelter. The Qiongzhou Marine Corps gathered in Haikou to meet the enemy (27th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The British patrol ship Ma Xuan, stationed in the West River, was anchored in the waters of Qi'ao on the afternoon of the 26th. It was mistaken by Guangdong aircraft for Chen Ce's ships and dropped six bombs, none of which hit and there was no damage (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The British gunboat Mohican, while traveling near the Triangle Island Lighthouse in Guangzhou yesterday afternoon, was suddenly attacked from the air by Guangzhou aircraft, which dropped six bombs in succession, all of which missed, but were all not far away. Naval personnel believed that this was a mistake. Another British gunboat also reported that it witnessed the aircraft attacking Chen Ce's gunboat Zhongshan (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) On the night of the 26th, the Shiwuitang Station on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Road was suddenly under strict martial law. Chen Jitang also dispatched two ships to the river surface there, waiting in strict formation, because the Railway Bureau reported that a regiment of Guangxi troops had arrived in Sanshui. Previously, Li Zongren had telegraphed to Guangdong, saying that when he came to Guangdong, he would bring a division with him, which would be assigned after being compiled in Guangdong to suppress bandits in Jiangxi. Chen Jitang replied by telegram that it was not necessary to bring more troops. Upon receiving the report that the Guangxi troops had arrived in Sanshui, he immediately imposed martial law and convened military officers to discuss how to deal with it. By dawn, the situation had eased slightly, but the Guangzhou-Sanshui train only ran to Xiaotang. On the morning of the 27th, Chen Jitang ordered the Railway Bureau to prepare a train to go to Sanshui to welcome Li, but the train did not depart until 2:00 p.m. At the same time, a train on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway departed for Shilong to transport troops back to the province to defend it (27th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Customs in Andong, Yingkou, and Other Places Have Officially Implemented Takeover</p>
<p>Fukumoto Accepts New False Appointment and Returns to Customs Service</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to information from the Customs Administration, a telegram has been received from Liaoning saying that the Northeastern puppet organization formally took over the customs of Andong, Yingkou, Harbin, Hunchun, and Dalian on the 27th. The Dalian Customs Commissioner Fukumoto even accepted a new appointment from the puppet organization on this day and, together with 65 Japanese customs officials from the General Office, returned to the customs. The puppet organization also reappointed Chinese and foreign customs officials in other customs and asked them to continue working. However, the customs officials are in a dilemma and have telegraphed the Inspector General of Customs, Frederick Maze, for instructions (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The Manchurian government completely completed the implementation of the takeover of the eight customs offices in Andong, Yingkou, Harbin, Hunchun, Longjingcun, Aihui, Manchuria, and Bukenaniqia yesterday. From today onwards, the customs officials of Manchuria will begin handling the old customs' affairs. The total income of the old customs is approximately 25 million Haikwan taels per year. The Dalian Customs alone accounts for 14 million Haikwan taels. After deducting the portion for paying foreign debts, the Manchurian government can still obtain a great new source of revenue (27th Den-tsu Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs publicly announced on the 27th that, regarding Japan instigating the puppet organization of the Eastern Provinces to interfere with the Dalian Customs and forcing the banks storing tax funds to stop remitting funds to the Inspector General of Customs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Japanese ambassador on the evening of the 25th, lodging a serious protest. It stated that the Dalian Customs is located in the Dalian leased territory, and sovereignty over this leased territory still belongs to China. Moreover, in the 33rd year of Guangxu, the Chinese Inspector General of Customs and the Japanese Minister Hayashi concluded an agreement on the Dalian Customs, so the Inspector General of Customs handles the tax regulations stipulated by the Dalian Customs and the method of designating banks for depositing funds in the same way as other customs. The Japanese government now disregards its treaty obligations, on the one hand instigating the puppet organization of the Eastern Provinces to interfere with the customs in Andong and other places, and on the other hand ordering the Japanese customs commissioner of the Dalian Customs to stop remitting tax funds to the Inspector General of Customs, thereby undermining China's sovereignty over customs duties in the Eastern Provinces and Dalian Customs and affecting the collateral for China's domestic and foreign debts. This kind of action clearly violates the Covenant of the League of Nations, the resolutions of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and other relevant treaties. The Japanese government should bear full responsibility. In addition to reserving the right to demand compensation for the losses of each customs office, the Chinese government should lodge a serious protest, etc. (27th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person in diplomatic circles said that Fukumoto is an official hired by the Chinese Customs, and China has the right to decide his employment.

<p>London - During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Sir Samuel Hoare asked if the Japanese are often hesitant to fulfill their treaty obligations, and now violate the spirit of the 1907 treaty on the integrity of Chinese Customs. He asked if Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon has made any statements to Japan. The Foreign Secretary first replied to the member's question, saying that the Japanese government has not issued any guarantees on the integrity of Manchurian Customs from June 19th to the present. This matter is currently under active consideration, and he has communicated with Tokyo by telegram. The Foreign Secretary continued to answer the member's question, saying that the authorities in "Manchuria" have ordered the suspension of remittances to Shanghai for the customs revenues of Harbin, Niuzhuang, and Andong. He also said that the British Ambassador in Tokyo has been instructed to ascertain the facts regarding the Dalian Customs case and to express the British government's concern over this matter to the Japanese government. Subsequently, Conservative MP Hooton Law asked about the issue of the Shanghai Special District Court. The Foreign Secretary replied that negotiations are continuing on the issue of establishing an agreement for the court, based on conditions that would ensure the court's full independence and fair justice. The member further asked the Foreign Secretary when he would instruct the British representatives in China to expedite these negotiations, so as to avoid repeating the delays of the past. He asked if the Foreign Secretary was aware that the difficulty in ensuring the fairness of this court was the main cause of the events to date. The Foreign Secretary replied that he attached great importance to this point. He said that the existing agreement must be renewed by April 1933, but he would not delay proceeding with this matter because of this.

<p>Italian Representative Strongly Advocates Total Cancellation of Reparations and War Debts</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 27th: After returning to France, French Premier Herriot returned to Lausanne this morning. Shortly after, he met with Austrian Premier Dufresne. Then, British Prime Minister MacDonald and German Chancellor Papen also arrived here one after another. With the return of various committee members, the Lausanne Conference once again attracted the world's attention. The German-French talks will resume at 4:30 PM this afternoon, with Herriot and Papen meeting in hopes of clarifying the situation. In addition, the British and French delegations will hold a meeting at the same time, and British Prime Minister MacDonald and American Disarmament Representative Gibson will also hold consultations. Layton, the drafter of the Layton Report issued by the experts committee of the Basel Bank the day before, was also summoned to Lausanne today to join the British delegation.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 27th: At today's Lausanne Conference, the Italian delegation issued an unexpected letter from Italian representative Grandi to the chairman, British Prime Minister MacDonald, strongly arguing that reparations and war debts are interdependent. If only one is cancelled, it is not a sufficient solution. The Italian delegation believes that reorganizing the currency system and stabilizing the finances of several countries are prerequisites for reviving trade in Europe and the most effective way to restore commerce. Countries in need of assistance should be assisted by the central banks of various countries through the cooperation of international banks. In addition, gradually reducing tariff barriers and removing other obstacles that hinder the free flow of goods are also urgent tasks.</p>

Officials here do not pay much attention to this, because using the recognition of "Manchukuo" as the price of disarmament is an inconceivable thing. Gibson, the chief American representative stationed in Geneva, reported to Secretary of State Stimson by long-distance telephone today, stating that the Japanese chief representative Matsudaira's attitude was still amiable, but he was unable to negotiate the disarmament plan before receiving instructions from Tokyo. It is recognized here that the Japanese side's silence is a sign of hope, and that the disarmament plan fundamentally involves Europe and has less to do with Japan.</p>

Today, the local guidance newspaper published the full text of his speech, claiming that the election results will definitely give the right wing a very large majority, and the National Rights Party will be a strong force in forming this majority. If the National Socialist Party is allowed to hold the country's power alone, the disaster will be endless. He also said that his opinions differ from Hitler's on political and economic matters. Regarding political aspects, the National Socialist Party has not yet decided whether Germany should be a republic or a monarchy, but the National Rights Party is bound to support the republic. Regarding economic aspects, the National Socialist Party disregards the basic laws of economics and advocates its own ideas. The socialism it advocates, and the socialism advocated by the Socialist Party, are both difficult to see the actual effect. Finally, he attacked the Catholic Central Party and the Socialist Party trade unions. It has long been rumored that the National Rights Party and the National Socialist Party are currently moving in very different directions, but this is the first time it has been publicly announced, and it is expected to have a major impact in the future.</p>

The new order will be signed by President Hindenburg and Interior Minister Geer and will be announced tomorrow. The content is to cancel the ban on uniforms and restore the right to hold open-air meetings, but if public safety is endangered, the police may temporarily prohibit the wearing of uniforms and holding open-air demonstrations. The last order to release the ban on the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers had incomplete legal procedures, which left loopholes for various excuses, so this order was specifically reissued. Furthermore, it is widely rumored that the federal government intends to announce martial law, but it is now known that this is not the case, because the police everywhere are now able to cope with local incidents.</p>

Glezinski is an important member of the Socialist Party, so he is determined not to yield to the arrogance of the National Socialist Party. Therefore, Glezinski also said that if the National Socialist Party hopes to run rampant in the streets of Berlin, it must first fight to the death with the police in Berlin and the power of the whole country. Therefore, if the figures of the National Socialist Party do not cherish their precious heads and rise up in revolt, then the strong men of other parties, including the Republic Emblem Party, will unite to form a defensive line.

<p>Fushun Coal Transport Depriving Workers of Livelihoods</p>
<p>The Inevitable Result of Japan's Aggressive Policies</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 27th: The transport of Fushun coal into Japan is closely related to the life-and-death issue of 400,000 members of the Chikugo Coal Miners' Union. The National Coal Miners' Union Council held a meeting in Tokyo today to discuss ways to prevent Fushun coal from entering the country. The union authorities have notified all workers that if this goal cannot be achieved, they will collectively resign and go on strike. The future of this issue is attracting considerable attention.</p>
<p>China United Press, Nagasaki, 27th: Since the September 18th Incident last year, Fushun coal has been boycotted in mainland China. The South Manchuria Railway Company has been transferring this coal to Japan for sale, resulting in severe pressure on Kyushu coal. Mine owners are unable to sustain operations and are facing bankruptcy. Consequently, many Japanese miners are being laid off, and the number of unemployed is increasing daily. The government and capitalists are at a loss. In their resentment, the workers have risen up, convening 240,000 miners from 53 mines, demanding relief from the government and capitalists. Representatives from various mines gathered in Hakata City, Fukuoka Prefecture, today to hold a general meeting to discuss countermeasures. The slogans "Prevent Fushun Coal from Entering the Country," "Oppose Mine Owners Closing Mines and Firing Workers," and "Demand the Government Provide Relief to Unemployed Miners" resonated throughout the meeting. After the meeting, they marched in formation and sent representatives to visit the Governor of Fukuoka Prefecture, the Director of the Mining Supervision Bureau, and various mine owners to present the workers' demands. It is reported that the workers' demands are forceful, and they will resort to any means necessary if the government does not comply. They are currently carrying provisions and awaiting a response from the authorities. The result of Japan's aggressive policies has created endless suffering for the people.</p>

A decree has been signed declaring all actions of the People's Party to be legal. Currently, the King and Queen of Siam arrived in the capital after midnight yesterday and proceeded to the Sukhothai Palace. This morning, they met with one civilian and one military leader of the People's Party to discuss the new government and constitutional issues. There were also military guards present. It is reported that this draft constitution was secretly agreed upon by key members of the People's Party a year ago. When the King and Queen of Siam arrived at the station, they were greeted by Boy Scouts and police standing in formation. After the King and Queen alighted from the train, they immediately proceeded to the Sukhothai Palace. Prince Prachatipatai, the Minister of Transportation, and Prince Svasti, the King's uncle, accompanied the King to the palace and were not detained. However, Prince Alongkot, the Deputy Minister of National Defense, who commanded the army, disembarked at the central station and went to the palace, where he was immediately placed under house arrest in the Chao Phraya Hall along with other princes.</p>
<p>Havas, Bangkok, 26th: The situation in Bangkok is currently very stable. The new People's Party, which has seized power, has been able to completely control the political situation. Many captured princes, princesses, and consorts are still being held hostage and will only be released after the new government is established. However, they are being treated very well. The Minister of Foreign Affairs stated that the new government will do its best to protect foreigners.</p>

<p>Representatives from Czechoslovakia and other countries are particularly active. According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun, the League of Nations Special Committee has extended the deadline for the report on the Sino-Japanese incident. Meanwhile, it has confirmed the continuation of the nineteen-nation committee meeting. However, recently, representatives from small countries such as Czechoslovakia and Spain have been actively promoting the idea that "although the delay in the report by the investigation committee is unavoidable, the situation in the Shanghai incident has greatly changed since the last general meeting. As for the Manchurian affair, the League of Nations should not stand idly by and delay any longer. In particular, it is not appropriate to hold only formal meetings. The report of Lytton and others should be combined with various other information as a basis for reviewing the recent situation in China and Japan and promptly expressing the League of Nations' views." Currently, representatives from Czechoslovakia and Spain are actively lobbying among representatives from various countries in the League of Nations. Therefore, it is expected that they will express strong opinions at the meeting to oppose Japan.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Japanese Monitoring German and American Journalists <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Pseudo-Administration Summoning Two Journalists</p>
<p>The French Consul Demanding an Apology from the Japanese</p>
<p>Lytton Has Sent a Telegram Clarifying the Relationship</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The American journalist Steele and the German journalist Linde, who recently visited General Ma Zhanshan in Hailun, Northwest Tonghe Town, are currently under Japanese surveillance and have extremely limited freedom of movement. Until this matter is resolved, the Japanese seem unwilling to allow the two to leave Harbin, partly to prevent them from transmitting so-called secret documents of Ma Zhanshan to the League of Nations investigation team, and partly to prevent them from reporting to the envoy, which could lead to expanded negotiations. However, on the nights of the 17th and 18th, the Japanese again directed the pseudo-administration to summon the two journalists. Linde was accompanied by the French consul, while Steele was sent by the American consulate. After arriving at the pseudo-administration, they were interrogated by Yagi, the Japanese advisor to the judicial section of the pseudo-police department, regarding the purpose of their visit to Ma, whether they had a mission from the investigation team, and what the content of their conversation with Ma was, demanding that they submit their records for review. Both journalists stated that their visit to Ma was out of curiosity. Because the League of Nations investigation team had secretly met with Ma Zhanshan's envoy after arriving in Harbin and had multiple conversations, the investigation team prepared to meet with Ma at a certain place on the Hu-Hai Road. Later, due to strong opposition from the Japanese, this plan was canceled. The two journalists then took the opportunity to meet secretly with Ma's envoy to arrange the formalities for meeting Ma. Before departure, they met with Ma's envoy and many guards in Songpu City and went together to Tonghe Town. The content of their conversation was only questions that news reporters should ask. The records were in Chinese, and they did not know what was said, as they were recorded by one of Ma's secretaries at the time and handed to them before departure. These records have now been translated by the American journalist Handa and handed over to French Consul Nonat. It is said that the pseudo-administration questioned them twice, and the two journalists answered in the same way each time. The Japanese then negotiated with American Consul Hanson, demanding the submission of the conversation records. The American consul ordered them to obtain them directly from the French consulate. When the Japanese requested them from the French consul, the French consul said that requesting to read them was not difficult, but the issue of recognition of Manchuria by the League of Nations must be resolved first. Now that Manchuria has not been recognized by the countries of the world, it cannot exercise any rights over foreigners or arrest and detain foreigners without authorization. The official Japanese authorities must formally apologize to the French consulate and to Mr. Linde in accordance with diplomatic procedures before the records can be handed over. After receiving the reply, the Japanese considered it too embarrassing and will order Shi Liben, the pseudo-state's negotiator stationed in Harbin, to raise the negotiation through diplomatic means. Therefore, unless this matter is resolved, the two journalists will not be removed from surveillance and will not be allowed to leave Harbin. At noon on the 19th, Linde visited Shi Liben at the pseudo-negotiation office in a private capacity. Sugihara, the Japanese director of the general affairs department, came out to meet him. Linde questioned why a country without extraterritorial rights would arrest and detain foreigners at will. His visit to Ma was the duty of a news reporter, and there was nothing wrong with it. Furthermore, he had entered and exited the battlefields during the Shanghai war without any restrictions. Why, upon arriving in the Northeast, would he be subjected to unreasonable restrictions by the Japanese? The records are in the French consulate, and everything can be negotiated directly with them. His freedom must be restored, and his residence must not be monitored or searched without reason. Sugihara immediately retorted, saying that Ma Zhanshan was a rebel of the new state, and no one was allowed to meet him without the permission of Manchuria in order to prevent the leakage of Manchurian military secrets. If the conversation records were irrelevant, why would they not hand them over? He finally added that he had obtained sufficient evidence to prove that Ma Zhanshan was transmitting information to the League of Nations. Now, Manchuria would not rest until it had obtained the evidence. Linde left in anger upon hearing this. Regarding this matter, Lytton, the chairman of the investigation team, sent a telegram to Harbin to the Japanese yesterday, the gist of which was: "I read in the newspaper that the two reporters who met with General Ma Zhanshan, Steele (correspondent for the New York Times of America) and Linde (reporter for the Die Weltwoche of Switzerland), were reported to be representatives of the League of Nations investigation team. In the name of the investigation team, I hereby declare to you that these reporters, whether in the past or present, are not members of the investigation team, nor has the investigation team entrusted them to meet with Ma Zhanshan." Although the telegram explained it in this way, the Japanese did not believe it. It is unknown where the future diplomatic dispute will lead. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Chen Jitang Deploys Defense in Northern Guangdong <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Independent Brigade Commander Fan Dexing Suddenly Dismissed</p>
<p>Li Hanxun Incorporates Fan's Troops and Expands Them into a Division</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangdong provincial troops that entered Fujian are now only the Independent 1st Division under Huang Renhuan, still stationed on the border of Shanghang and Jiaoling, and two newly formed independent regiments have been added to assist in defense. Gan Zhuo has been appointed as the commander of the Independent 1st Regiment, and He Maochen as the commander of the Independent 2nd Regiment, recruiting troops. The remaining troops, the 3rd Army's 8th Division under Huang Zhiwen, have returned to Meixian and Xingning, and the 7th Division under Huang Yanzhen has also returned to the Songkou Sanheba area. It is recently rumored that the 8th Division will be transferred to the Huizhou area, so that the 2nd Army's 5th Division under Zhang Da, stationed in Huizhou, can be transferred elsewhere. In short, Chen Jitang seems to have slightly relaxed his posture towards Fujian. However, Chen is paying close attention to the Jiangxi front, and Jiangxi is close to northern Guangdong, so Chen Jitang has recently intensified the deployment of defenses in northern Guangdong. Moreover, for the convenience of transportation, he has ordered the counties of Nanxiong and Renhua from the Northwest Pacification Headquarters to expedite the completion of the traffic roads. Furthermore, feeling that the military strength in the Xiongshao area is still weak, he has specially transferred the Independent 1st Brigade under Fan Dexing, which had entered Jiangxi, back to Shaoguan to be stationed. After Fan's troops arrived in Shaoxiong, Fan Dexing returned to the province to report on military affairs in southern Jiangxi. Unexpectedly, after arriving in the province, Chen Jitang immediately reassigned him as a Major General Senior Staff Officer of the 1st Army Group Headquarters. It is rumored that Fan was dismissed due to some relationship, and there are many other rumors. In any case, the inside story is difficult for outsiders to know in detail. As for the three regiment soldiers of the 1st Independent Brigade left behind by Fan, Chen Jitang ordered Li Hanxun, the Northwest Pacification Commissioner, to reorganize them into the Independent 3rd Division of the Army, and also incorporated the 1st Independent Regiment under Liang Guowu, directly under the 1st Army Group Headquarters, into the division as its training regiment. Chen Jitang also appointed Li Hanxun as the commander of the Independent 3rd Division. Chen Boying, the former commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Independent 1st Brigade, was appointed as the Colonel Commander of the 1st Infantry Regiment of the division. Liao Daoming, the former commander of the 1st Regiment of the Independent 1st Brigade, was appointed as the Colonel Commander of the 2nd Regiment of the division. Qiu Guixun, the former commander of the 3rd Regiment of the Independent 1st Brigade, was appointed as the Colonel Commander of the 3rd Regiment of the division. Liang Guowu was appointed as the Colonel Commander of the training regiment. Wu Yiqi was appointed as the Chief of Staff of the division, Liu Shiliang as the Lieutenant Colonel Director of the Staff Office of the division headquarters, and Lin Shaoxian as the Lieutenant Colonel Director of the Adjutant Office. After receiving the order, Li Hanxun returned to the province from Shaoguan on the 20th to seek instructions from Chen Jitang on everything, and temporarily ordered all the troops of the former Independent 1st Brigade to be concentrated in northern Guangdong to await reorganization. The training regiment under Liang Guowu is currently stationed in Leizhou and is responsible for the heavy task of attacking Hainan Island, so it cannot leave its defense temporarily. Li only sent personnel to go to check the numbers and change the markings. It is heard that the headquarters of the Independent 3rd Division is still located in the Northwest Pacification Commissioner's Office in Shaoguan, in order to facilitate command of the three regiments and deployment of military affairs in northern Guangdong.

<p>Zheng Guilin's Troops Repeatedly Defeat Strong Enemies</p>
<p>Cui Rongshan's Troops Recapture Tai'an</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Zheng Guilin, commander of the 48th Route of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, led his troops, totaling over a thousand men, from Linyu on June 2nd and advanced towards Xingcheng. Upon receiving the news, the Japanese army dispatched over two hundred cavalrymen, carrying machine guns and field artillery, from Sifangtai to intercept. When they reached Gaoling Station, the two sides were very close, so Commander Zheng dispatched the 17th Brigade of the Second Brigade to launch a fierce attack. Fierce fighting broke out at 11 p.m. that night. The National Salvation Army demolished several sections of the pseudo-Fengshan Road, cut off several telegraph lines, and destroyed the ticket office. After holding out for about two hours, the Japanese army was unable to withstand and retreated. In this battle, one officer of the National Salvation Army was wounded, and seven or eight enemies were killed. At 3 p.m. on June 8th, Commander Zheng led his troops to continue advancing towards Xingcheng. When they reached Guchengzi, they encountered twelve Japanese cavalrymen and planned to surround and attack them immediately. The Japanese soldiers did not resist and desperately fled. At 1 a.m. on the 9th, all troops arrived near Xingcheng and dispatched engineers to break bridges in two directions and demolish the railway to prevent enemy armored trains from advancing. They also dispatched the Second Brigade and the Guard Battalion of the Fifth Brigade as vanguards, and the 17th Brigade, the 8th Brigade, the Guard Company of the Third Brigade, and the Guard Battalion as the main force, to attack the enemy troops stationed at the station from the left and right flanks. The Japanese army had prepared in advance, setting up power grids and laying landmines and other obstacles. The officers and soldiers of the National Salvation Army disregarded their own safety, braved the rain of bullets, and rushed to the station and the enemy troops stationed at the Mashen Temple, throwing grenades. Fierce fighting broke out for a while. Enemy guns and bullets rained down, and artillery fire was also loud and continuous. The National Salvation Army killed over two hundred enemy troops, destroyed two of their machine guns, and completely destroyed the station buildings. However, the enemy troops occupied high ground and used machine guns to sweep the area, so the National Salvation Army could not charge up. The enemy also increased reinforcements and attacked the flanks of the National Salvation Army. The National Salvation Army suffered heavy losses, and as dawn broke, enemy armored trains arrived from Suizhong and fired artillery at the National Salvation Army, and planes dropped bombs. The National Salvation Army was forced to retreat. However, over a hundred enemy cavalrymen and six airplanes pursued from the main road. When they reached Guchengzi, they were ambushed and killed over two hundred by the National Salvation Army, and the enemy fled. In this battle, twenty-one officers and soldiers of the National Salvation Army were killed in action, including Zhou Diheng, a member of the Dare-to-Fight-the-Japanese Squad. He was a young patriot who was killed on the battlefield. Dying for the country is certainly glorious, but it is also very regrettable.</p>
<p>Also, Zhang Yaodong, the 15th Brigade commander of the army, advanced towards Qianwei at 2 p.m. on the 14th. At about 9 p.m., they encountered over two hundred Japanese troops and pseudo-police in the northwest of the area and fought fiercely for four hours. The Japanese army was unable to withstand and retreated. The National Salvation Army had just entered the village to search when the Japanese army suddenly launched a fierce attack with reinforcements from the railway. Because it was late at night, and the enemy's forces were very strong, they had to retreat to Xiaoshankou. In this battle, four or five enemies were killed, over ten were wounded, and five rifles were seized. Wu Jinggui, a sergeant of the National Salvation Army, was killed in action, and three soldiers were wounded by bombs.</p>
<p>Also, Fang Weixin, the pseudo-county magistrate of Tai'an, under the orders of the Japanese, exploited the people and issued 280,000 yuan in relief coupons to purchase grain on behalf of the Japanese. The coupons had no credibility, and their value depreciated daily. When they were first issued, they were exchanged directly for silver dollar banknotes, but now thirty yuan can be exchanged for one yuan. The people hated him to the bone. Later, the troops of Cui Rongshan, belonging to the 1st Route of the National Salvation Army, led two thousand men and occupied Tai'an County, and Fang fled. Cui then implemented county administration with the local gentry, and the people deeply celebrated the recapture of the county.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Anhui Western Bandit Suppression Situation <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Independent 40th Brigade Counterattacks Huoqiu</p>
<p>Hu, Xu, Wang and Other Divisions Converge to Aid Lu'an</p>
<p>Su Jiabu Communist Bandits Infighting</p>
<p>From Bengbu Correspondent: After the communist bandits of the false 21st Army in western Anhui occupied Huoqiu, they burned, killed, raped, and plundered, committing all kinds of atrocities. They slaughtered men, women, old and young, regardless of the poor or rich. Initially, they would bury the corpses, but recently, they have been discarded everywhere. The killings are mostly carried out at night. Corpses with blood and flesh are often seen in streets, ponds, bamboo forests, and deep gardens. At this time of hot weather, the stench is unbearable. Most of the tall buildings have been burned down, with rubble everywhere, a desolate sight. The communist bandits on the Anhui border are using Yingshan as their base. The county seat of Lu'an is still surrounded. Xu Tingyao, commander of the 4th Division, after taking the position of commander of the right-wing army, immediately led his troops to Zheng Yang. He convened various officers, personally instructed them on strategies, allocated tasks to various units, and planned to launch an attack in the coming days. He assigned Song Shike's unit of the Independent 40th Brigade of the Army, familiar with the terrain, to take on the lead attack mission. Song Shike then ordered Zhang Benyu's 719th Regiment and Wang Shaojiu's 720th Regiment, stationed in Zheng Yang, to advance towards Huoqiu. He then concentrated Cheng Yi's 718th Regiment, stationed in Yingheji, at Liuzikou, and assigned Sun Peiji's Huoqiu Garrison Regiment to act as guides, attacking the bandits entrenched in Xindianbu, Huangjiamiao, and Chenjiabu. Zhang Yaoming's 1st Supplementary Regiment of the 4th Division and various special forces would assist later to provide support. On the 21st, at dawn, the attack began. The communist bandits of the false 25th Army concentrated their main force in the area of Xindianbu and Huangjiamiao, building simple fortifications, trying to resist stubbornly. However, after the bandit suppression army launched a general offensive, they made progress step by step, and broke the main force of the communist bandits in Xindianbu, and then recovered the town. The 4th Division immediately announced in Zheng Yang to the refugees from the northern villages of Huoqiu scattered everywhere to go to Zheng Yang to collect disaster victim homecoming permits so that the troops along the way could let them pass and protect them to return to their homes to harvest wheat. The Song Brigade continued to advance, successively occupying Zhao圩 and Pei圩 south of Xindianbu. It has now crossed the 20-li fort and is not far from Huoqiu. The task of attacking Huoqiu will be completely taken over by the Song Brigade. The main force of the 4th Division will advance south along the Pi River from Zheng Yang, passing through Matouji, Yinxianji, Yingheji and other places, to approach Lu'an, hoping to join forces with the 1st and 7th Divisions to relieve the siege of Lu'an, because a certain regiment of the bandit suppression army is still trapped inside the city of Lu'an, urgently awaiting rescue. It is reported that the communist bandits are besieging Lu'an from the southwest. The city gates on the northeast side are open, and civilians can still enter and exit. There is no trace of bandits along the Pi River area from Zheng Yang to Lu'an, and traffic is unimpeded. The bandit suppression army going to Lu'an to relieve the siege is taking Wang Jun's 7th Division as the front, attacking from the east; Hu Zongnan's 1st Division as the left wing, attacking from the south; and Xu Tingyao's 4th Division as the right wing, attacking from the north. According to intelligence from the 12th Division, there were about one division of communist bandits in the Hexi area of Lu'an County, entrenched near Su Jiabu. Many of them are awakened elements, unable to bear the oppression, and have spontaneously turned against the communists. Therefore, the false central communist forces transferred a large number of Red Army from Huoqiu to solve this group of communist bandits. They are now killing each other. The collapse of the communist bandits in western Anhui is imminent. (26th)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Qianjiang River Suddenly Rises Several Feet <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Heavy Rain for Days</p>
<p>Embankment Precariously Endangered</p>
<p>From Hangzhou Correspondent: The water in the upper reaches of the Qianjiang River in Zhejiang Province is surging turbulently. Since the 17th of this month, due to continuous mold rain, the upstream water has been flowing down. The sand area on the north bank of Guanyintang outside Qingtai Gate has already collapsed for more than fifty yards. The Municipal Water Conservancy Bureau is collecting sacks to try to repair it. Unexpectedly, since the 23rd, there has been heavy rain pouring down day and night. The Qianjiang River has suddenly risen several feet. From the 25th to the 27th, the sand area on the north bank from Muqiaotou to Yibao area has been washed away for more than twenty yards again. The No. 94 water lifting dam has been damaged. The river water is only a foot away from the stone embankment. The water at Datong Bridge and other places is already level with the embankment, which is extremely dangerous. Mayor Zhao Zhiyou and Water Conservancy Bureau Director Zhang Zili went to inspect and then rushed to send workers to build three more water lifting dams, which are scheduled to be completed in four months. Zhu Kongshuang, the ninth district chief in that area, said that the stone embankment from Erliangting to Sixty-Kuaitou, which is about seven or eight li long, is not very strong due to disrepair over the years. Now it is being impacted by the river water, and it feels even more dangerous, especially the Fangxiatan near Guanyintang is the most serious. He specially submitted another request to the Municipal Government to forward it to the Construction Department to order the Water Conservancy Bureau to repair it quickly. If a breach occurs, not only will the people along the river suffer greatly, but the three prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing and Huzhou may also be flooded. Fortunately, the weather is sunny today, and the water level is expected to recede slightly. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Zhejiang Province Plans to Appropriately Reduce Business Tax Rate <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou News: The Zhejiang Provincial Government, due to previous financial deficits, revised the business tax rate, which was scheduled to be increased to 10 per mille from April 1st. Unexpectedly, after the announcement, it aroused opposition from merchants in various counties throughout Zhejiang. The spring business tax that has not been collected has also been affected and has not been concluded so far. The Provincial Government and the Department of Finance have received hundreds of telegrams from various merchant groups requesting exemption from the increased business tax. On the 6th of this month, after the general meeting of members of the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the entire body petitioned the Provincial Government, the Provincial Party Department, and the Department of Finance. After several consultations by important figures from the party, government, and business, the Provincial Government, in order to comply with the business situation, has a great intention to revise the tax rate and has submitted it for discussion. It is heard that the general idea is to reduce the summer tax rate from 10 per mille to 5 per mille. For various industries with the old tax rates of 10 per mille and 5 per mille, they will still follow the old rates. However, in order to equalize the tax rules, it is necessary to make overall plans, deliberate carefully, and then start to revise. As for the merchants in various places, this time they have risen up to seek exemption from harsh taxes, which is really compelled by circumstances. If the amount of collection can be reduced, there will naturally be no insistence on dissent. (27th)</p>

<p>Rickshaw pullers strike. There were originally more than 280 rickshaws in the city, but more than 240 were lost in the war. The Di, Ji, and Ren companies, considering the heavy losses, jointly increased the rent. The original price was 52 cents per rickshaw per month, but it was increased to 20 cents per rickshaw per day. The rickshaw pullers asked for a reduction to no avail, so they went on strike unanimously on the morning of the 26th. The County Chamber of Commerce mediated and convened both parties in the afternoon to persuade them to make concessions, but there was no result.</p>

<p>A Young Woman Commits Suicide in a Wuxi Hotel. A female guest from Shanghai arrived at the Wuxi Hotel on Gongyun Bridge at more than two o'clock on the night of the 23rd. She was dressed exquisitely and signed herself as Ms. Zou, 23 years old, from the Sichuan academic community. On the 25th, she said that she would go to Nanjing, and bought letter paper and envelopes, closed the door to write a letter. After about four hours, she did not come out. The waiter heard intermittent moans from the room, and peeped through the crack, only to see Zou Yurong looking miserable. He rushed into the room to check and saw an empty bottle of Nalian sleeping pills under the bed, knowing that she was poisoned. He rushed her to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but they said that she was deeply poisoned and it would be difficult to save her. The lady could speak various dialects such as Sichuan, Shanghai, and Guangdong, and her clothes were all silk. It seemed that she had received higher education. However, there was a note on each of her left and right wrists, which read, "Bad luck, better to die." The handwriting was delicate, so the reason for her suicide could not be known.</p>
<p>Wuxi Chamber of Commerce Opposes Special Business Tax. More than 80 industries in Wuxi, including oil, beans, cotton yarn, cloth, paper, tea, and north-south goods, believe that the special business tax in the guise of likin in Jiangsu Province has been set to be implemented and levied on July 1st. At this time of financial recovery and economic depression, not only are merchants unable to cope, but it also violates central laws and regulations. They held an emergency temporary meeting in the Chamber of Commerce the day before yesterday and decided to organize a tax law research committee and send telegrams to home and abroad requesting public judgment. The telegram reads as follows: "The loss from abolishing likin and increasing taxes has already been compensated. The nature of both business and consumption taxes is already supplementary, and according to the original likin abolition plan of 1928, the Ministry of Finance, based on the resolutions of the National Financial Conference and the likin abolition telegram, abolished all domestic likin and various transit taxes similar to likin nationwide, and at the same time established special consumption taxes (that is, the unified tax currently administered by the central government) and business taxes administered by the provinces to compensate. Now Jiangsu Province is implementing a special business tax in the guise of likin, which has fundamentally overturned the original likin abolition plan of 1928. After likin abolition, the customs duties added by the central government, the unified taxes administered domestically, and the business taxes administered by the provinces are all without foundation. At this time, the war in Shanghai has just stopped, and the market has plummeted. Merchants are struggling in pain, and considering the government's difficulties, they dare not rush to ask for relief. How can they bear more burdens? Therefore, an emergency temporary meeting of various industries was held on the 24th, and it was decided that if the special business tax in Jiangsu Province is implemented and levied, in order to maintain the central government's original likin abolition plan and to express its determination, it will have to suspend all unified and business taxes first, and send telegrams to home and abroad requesting public judgment. We hereby telegraphically state first, and respectfully request your public judgment. Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce kowtows." It is also heard that the Department of Finance, in view of the enthusiastic opposition of merchants in various places, has room for maneuver and no longer insists on implementing and levying on July 1st. However, the provincial treasury is in dire straits, and if no other means of compensation are devised, it will be difficult to maintain. Yesterday, it specially invited Yu Xiaochuan, Qian Sunqing, Wang Jingting and others, standing members of the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, to negotiate in the province today (27th) for a thorough discussion on the two sample measures contributed by the Chamber of Commerce Federation, such as rectifying two months of rent throughout the province, and levying business license tax and pre-paying a quarter of taxes.</p>

<p>Roving Bandits Rob a Fast Boat. The Qingyang Kaicheng fast boat, yesterday (25th) at about 5 pm, was sailing from the city to Qing. When passing near Sanhekou Wangzhen, two roving bandits boarded the boat. Together with a bandit on the shore, they fired a pistol. They searched the passengers in the cabin. Li, the concubine of the late Huangqiao Township Director Gu Yuqing, had her gold ring, gold bracelet, banknotes and clothes robbed, losing two or three hundred yuan. After the robbery, the two bandits went ashore and fled towards Jiaodian in Wujin territory. One bandit accidentally shot himself in the abdomen while hiding the gun and died. The boat arrived at Yueqiao, and after inspection by the defense team, they found a card with the number of He Chunfu, squad leader of the third squad of the fourth company of the Eleventh Division Ordnance Battalion, next to the dead bandit. The county was immediately reported to verify the identity, and the body was collected.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Resumption of Jimei. Since the Jimei pawnshop stopped operating, the party and government agencies, in order to maintain the economy of the common people, organized the board of directors and requested the Industrial Department of the County Government to add 100,000 yuan of capital within three months, together with the 200,000 yuan of capital, to officially resume the operation of the pawnshop. Before the capital was fully raised, the pawnshop was ordered to maintain the pawn redemption, and the department approved it. If the pawnshop collected the redemption money and挪用it for other purposes, the county was allowed to send personnel to stop it. After receiving the order, the agencies decided that before the capital was fully raised, the money released by the pawnshop would be used as capital, and the pawnshop would resume operation yesterday (25th), with a limit of two yuan per ticket. At about 9 am, the pawnshop was extremely crowded. The agencies also sent personnel to supervise, but the Sheng pawnshop owner denied the resumption of operation and insisted on closing down. However, the agencies decided that it was based on the order of the Industrial Department and would take effective measures to allow the long-term resumption of operation.</p>

When his family asked him what happened, the student said that after school that day, he was watching soccer at the public sports field. Two bandits dragged him to the side of a boat parked next to the sports field, forced him to get on the boat, covered his eyes, and stuffed his throat. The boat sailed away quickly. On the boat, one bandit asked who he was. He told the truth. The bandit said that he had made a mistake and wanted to kidnap the son of a Gu in the city. Because of this, they were not very guarded against him, so he was able to escape.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Ministry of Education Orders Short-Term Literacy Education <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education's order to all provinces and cities to implement literacy education and the first phase of compulsory education implementation measures was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Herewith, we publish the "Outline of Short-Term Compulsory Education Implementation Measures" and the full text of the Ministry's order separately as follows. It is said that the said order was drafted by five key members of the Ministry of Education and repeatedly revised before it was approved and issued. This shows the Ministry's emphasis on literacy education. The order states that since the late Qing Dynasty, enlightened people in our country have been aware of the necessity of popularizing education, and have spared no effort to advocate for compulsory education. The party platform also has a provision for "vigorously promoting the popularization of education," and the Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period even has a special article stating that "children who have reached school age should all receive compulsory education." The reason is that our country's national level is still immature. Whether we want to catch up with countries with higher national levels in terms of foreign affairs, or implement the minimum level of local autonomy in terms of domestic affairs, we must vigorously implement compulsory education and strive to popularize education.</p>
<p>However, for more than twenty years, advocacy and promotion have not been lacking in effort, and the duration of four years of primary school is not considered difficult to implement. However, judging from the facts, the national primary education statistics for the 18th year of the Republic show that only 17% of school-age children are enrolled. The goal of popularizing education seems far away. The reason why it has taken so long and required so much effort with so little effect is that the funding required for four years of compulsory education is in the tens of millions, and the number of teachers needed is in the millions, which is still a far cry from the actual state of the country's financial resources and existing teaching staff.</p>
<p>The Ministry is ordered by the Party and the country to urgently implement compulsory education. In order to adapt to the environment and facilitate promotion, it has specially formulated two types of implementation measures: the "Short-Term Compulsory Education Implementation Measures" and the "Outline of the First Phase of Compulsory Education Implementation Measures." The former is only for one year and is used to educate older, out-of-school children aged ten to sixteen. Therefore, it is called short-term compulsory education. The latter is still for four years, which is no different from what has been advocated and promoted in the past. The two measures are issued at the same time so that all provinces, counties, cities, and special districts directly under the Executive Yuan can implement them simultaneously, or give priority to short-term compulsory education, according to the amount of their funding and teachers, in order to achieve rapid results.</p>
<p>In terms of funding, a teacher in short-term compulsory education teaches three classes of older, out-of-school children in the morning, afternoon, and evening, giving each class two hours of education. With 40 students per class, 120 children can graduate in one year. Compared with three teachers giving full-day education to two classes of primary school children, also with 40 students per class, 80 children can graduate in four years. The difference in the amount of funding required is no less than a ratio of 1 to 18. In terms of teachers, the curriculum for short-term compulsory education is only literacy and simple arithmetic, which is easy to teach, and those who know a little reading and arithmetic can do it well. Compared with the complex curriculum of primary school, which is difficult to teach, and which cannot be handled without professional teacher training, the difficulty of finding teachers is also different. Since funding is saved and teachers are easier to find, it is not difficult to achieve universalization even if the level is shallow.</p>
<p>In areas where financial resources are limited to short-term compulsory education, school-age children under the age of ten cannot increase their enrollment opportunities. However, given the current weakness of the national economy, only one or two out of ten families can afford to send their children to receive four years of compulsory education. Even if primary schools are everywhere, they are all unable to enroll. Moreover, older children have a richer learning ability, and the effect of one year may sometimes be no different from that of a six-year-old who receives four years of education. If short-term compulsory education can be implemented so that all out-of-school children over the age of ten in the country can receive one year of education, the increase in national standards and efficiency will be self-evident. In all countries of the world, the duration of compulsory education is gradually being extended, while our country is turning from four years to one year. On the surface, it seems to be different from others, not advancing but retreating. However, in reality, given the lack of funding and teachers in our country, there is no way to promote the popularization of education. It is like the poor without a foothold seeing the vast mansions of others, and being endlessly envious. However, rather than hoping for a one-in-a-million chance and delaying action, it is better to build a thatched hut that can shelter from the wind and rain. In the future, as the national level gradually increases and the social economy rises with it, when funding and teachers can be solved, not only can four years of compulsory education be expected to be popularized, but it can also be extended to six, eight, or even more than ten years, surpassing all countries in the world. This is not impossible.</p>
<p>Since the measures have just been finalized, I am deeply afraid that the matter is unique and that people in the country will not understand the meaning, or even doubt the righteousness, or even fail to implement them effectively and delay the grand plan. Therefore, the intention of short-term compulsory education is repeatedly explained, hoping for common understanding.</p>
<p>The two measures are hereby sent with the order. The said department is requested to refer to the local situation and earnestly comply with the implementation from the 21st year of the Republic. Those who cannot implement the first phase of compulsory education at the same time should give priority to implementing the short-term compulsory education measures and submit a concrete plan within one month of receiving the document to report for the record and implement it on schedule without delay. This is of utmost importance. This order distributes two copies each of the Short-Term Compulsory Education Implementation Measures and the Outline of the First Phase of Compulsory Education Implementation Measures (the first phase of compulsory education measures were reported in yesterday's newspaper).</p>

<p>Pay off the April fees before the end of July. The Joint Association of Teachers and Staff of Jiangsu Provincial Middle Schools, because the current semester is about to end and only half a month's worth of funds have been issued, held an emergency meeting of plenipotentiary representatives of various schools in Zhenjiang on the 22nd of this month to discuss concrete measures. The Director of Education, Zhou Fohai, went to attend because the atmosphere was extremely tense due to the strikes by provincial schools. He detailed the difficulties of the province and strongly urged them not to go to extremes, saying that he would do his best to find a solution. After the representatives of the various schools adjourned, they went to the Finance Department, where Director Shu personally received them. In addition to first consulting with the Shanghai Bank to overdraw 50,000 yuan for the provincial education fees owed by the Finance Department, he promised to continue to find ways to repay them. The representatives then went to Ning the next day as a whole to the Education Funding Management Office to sit in and demand payment.

<p>Architectural Excellence Unsurpassed. The Olympic Village, which brings together athletes from 51 countries, has now been completed. This truly international village has a total of 550 beautiful and exquisite small houses, which are no less than an exhibition of model cities. The roofs are painted blue, and the walls are white and pink. Each house has two rooms, and each room can accommodate two people. The room is equipped with two spring beds and a washstand, all of which are from famous American factories. The preparatory committee has separately stipulated the positions of the athletes of various countries. The largest of the cafeterias is the American group, which can accommodate 21 people. All the tables and chairs are rattan furniture for summer use. The meals for each athlete are selected according to the preferences of each country. The Japanese group is about half a mile from the front, east of Turkey, Yugoslavia, Hungary, west of Belgium, and behind France, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Lithuania, and Finland. The village divides its area by language. For example, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Australia, etc., use English as a group, which is in the northeast corner of the village. The committee members of various countries stay in the general affairs building at the main entrance. At the entrance, there are residences for athletes from Mexico, Spain, Cuba, etc. The village is equipped with a fire brigade, which patrols day and night. The telephone bureau uses switchboard operators from various countries, and there is also a hospital. In the middle of the village, there is an amusement park and an open-air theater. In front of the main entrance, 55 national flags of participating countries are clustered. Among them, the most famous French and Spanish cuisines in the world have hired famous chefs to come to the meeting to cook. The athletes who have arrived are all drinking and eating wildly, and those who are on the way and have not arrived are also salivating at the news.</p>

<p>Football will disappear in India. The Indian field hockey team attending the World Games this time has a total of 17 players, along with the team leader, Mr. and Mrs. Lin Bai, and the swimmer Malik, a total of 20 people. The team stayed in Japan for ten days and set off from Yokohama on the Ryudamaru on the 24th. The team performed their magical skills in Japan, defeating the Japanese team by 22 to 0. The mystery of their technology was praised by everyone. According to the team leader, Lin Bai, the strength of the country's field hockey is as follows: The Indian field hockey team's attendance at the World Games began at the 8th Paris Games in 1924. Now, a comprehensive conference is held every two years in the country, and it is particularly enthusiastic about local teams. Records are updated one after another and have long exceeded world standards. The Far East Conference has persuaded the country to join, but due to limited funds, it has not been able to send more players. This team is the holder of the previous World Championship. Among the players selected this time, there are only four old players. Indian football, which was most popular on the 21st, is now almost extinct. Most people have abandoned it and practiced field hockey. The reason why Indian field hockey is so strong is that Indians do not have the habit of smoking or drinking, so their eyesight is particularly sharp, and they are particularly effective in handling white balls. They have reached the upper level in terms of hitting stick skills and defensive work. Although there are strong German enemies at this conference, they are confident that they can definitely keep the championship.</p>
<p>In addition, some Indian track and field and swimming athletes have already arrived in the United States. The schedule of the field hockey team was slightly delayed. It was originally scheduled to stay in Japan for a week, but it has been delayed for ten days.</p>

<p>Ma Xiaohu vs. Cao Weilin The open handball competition hosted by the YMCA has been going on for days. The winners went straight ahead and the losers fell behind. Until yesterday, there were only two groups left, Ma vs. Hua and Cao vs. Rong, to compete for the final. The competition situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ma Xiaohu beat Feng Gang. Among the two groups of competitions, this group was the most exciting. In the first game, the scores of the two sides were close from beginning to end. Ma was good at attacking and Hua was good at defending. The number of wins and losses seemed to be suspended in the air, and it was unknown where it would go. After 18 draws, the god of luck suddenly came to Ma's body, so he won the first game with 21 to 18. In the second game, there were several draws at 3-3, 8-8, and 11-11. Hua fell into a slump, and Ma won again with 21 to 14, for a total of 2-0.</p>
<p>Cao Weilin beat Rong Jiarong. After the fight, the skills of a pair of sticky candies were judged to be superior or inferior, so Cao won two consecutive games with 21 to 6 and 21 to 9.</p>
<p>Today at 5:30 pm is the final. Cao Ma, one soft and one hard, will definitely have another battle of dragons and tigers in the Zhongqing Fitness Room.</p>

<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhaifu</p>
<p>Thirty-nine, it's really funny to think about it carefully. It's the same Analects. The way I used to read it made me feel that there was nothing wrong with the Sage's book. Now, if I read it in a different way, I feel that every sentence needs to be re-evaluated. I am extremely remorseful. Why didn't I doubt the things that should have been doubted at all? However, fortunately, I have now received Mr. Zhu's guidance. From now on, I will not easily let go of even a single sentence in the books of the ancients. I remember someone said: "Learning is about knowing how to doubt: Great doubt leads to great progress: Small doubt leads to small progress: No doubt leads to no progress." I should reuse and use this word "doubt" heavily.</p>
<p>This time, when I read the Analects, I couldn't help but laugh when I read the passage about Gongshan Furao rebelling in Fei. When Confucius wanted to collude with the rebels, Zilu was unhappy. Confucius said, "Am I not a gourd? How can I hang here without eating?" Since you know you need to eat, why do you say, "A gentleman seeks the Way, not food"?</p>
<p>Forty. A-Yang ran to the door and gently told me: "They say that Mr. Song, whom you invited, is not capable and that he copied answers in the city." I asked him where he heard it from. He said that Wang Er's sister-in-law heard it from someone. I went to ask Wang Er's sister-in-law. She said that the tailor's clerk, Lao Qian, said it. So I went to ask Lao Qian. Lao Qian said that the carpenter, Wu, passed it on. By the time I tracked it down to the carpenter, Wu, and inquired in detail, I realized that the rumor was created by the bricklayer, Lao Xu. He's still making trouble here!</p>
<p>I traced the source of the rumor and returned to the temple to tell Mr. Zhu. But how could I be presumptuous? I thought about it and didn't know how to speak. Suddenly, the little brother ran over and said to Mr. Zhu without hiding anything, "Brother! People in the village say that you copied answers in the city and that you were last." The innocent and lively little brother, how could he speak so carelessly? Why don't I have his frankness and courage? He says everything that should be said.</p>
<p>"This rumor was created by the bricklayer, Lao Xu. I have already found out the truth." As soon as the little brother finished speaking, I explained the origin of the rumor in order to let Mr. Zhu know that Lao Xu deliberately spread the rumor so that he could feel more comforted in his heart.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said, "Lao Xu is not spreading rumors. It is true that I copied answers in the city and was last. He probably investigated it on the spot."</p>

<h3 id="e127">Enlightenment <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Whether it's science, philosophy, or literature, all require effort on the word "enlightenment." What is called enlightenment? It is to derive a new path from the most ordinary materials.</p>
<p>Seeing fruit falling, understanding gravity; seeing a kettle boiling, understanding the steam engine; such earth-shattering divine enlightenment is worth commemorating forever!</p>
<p>"Constantly calling out to Xiaoyu, why? Only so that Tanlang recognizes the voice." These are fragrant and seductive verses; however, a certain virtuous elder broke through Zen secrets from these two lines.</p>
<p>"How can one bear that glance of her autumn eyes as she departs?" This is a lyric from the *Romance of the Western Chamber*; however, it is recorded in the sayings of National Master Hongjue, who also broke through Zen secrets from this line.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Lady Gongsun danced with swords, good calligraphers understood the method of using the brush; when Chef Ding dissected oxen for twelve years without dulling the blade, those who cultivate life understood the secret to preventing illness; as long as one is good at enlightenment, one can derive a new life from anything.</p>
<p>There are two exquisite lines in the *Selections of Refined Literature*: "Stone embraces jade, and the mountain shines. River contains pearls, and the water charms." Some people have gained insight into the principles of nourishing life from these two lines. Why do we often see young people with flesh not covering bones and blood not moisturizing skin? It is because the stone does not embrace jade, the river does not contain pearls; naturally, the mountain loses its brilliance, and the river loses its charm.</p>
<p>Duke Wenrui of Tongcheng, Zhang, heard Xunzhai say, roughly: In the stems of orchids and peonies, there must be a drop of dew; if this dewdrop is eaten by insects, the flower will wither. In the early morning, when carefully observing the newly emerged bamboo shoots, there must be several dewdrops at their ends; when the sun rises, the dew will gather and return to the roots, and reappear in the evening. People's primordial energy is also like dewdrops, and so on.</p>
<p>Young men and women! In this tide of flesh, you must have your own conviction, protect your dewdrops, and not let them be eaten by insects; this is the principle. Whenever your hearts are uncertain, please recite repeatedly: "Stone embraces jade, and the mountain shines. River contains pearls, and the water charms"; only stop reciting when your heart has conviction.</p>
<h3 id="e128">"Card Game" Under the Guidance of the Japanese Army Ministry <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— With Heart</p>
<p>Readers, upon seeing the three words "card game," may immediately think of gambling cards in the countryside, or imported playing cards, but the Japanese card game is not that thing.</p>
<p>Japan originally had two kinds of card games. One is called "Hanafuda," about the same size as poker cards, with words and flowers written on them, mostly playthings for girls. The other is the cards sold by candy sellers on the streets and alleys to trick children. These cards have pictures of people fighting or animals, etc. The seller shakes a bell, gathers many children, and they all look at the pictures and listen to the stories in the pictures. He tells one story and changes the card. At that point, he takes out candy and sells it to the children, who listen to him while holding candy in their mouths. He also earns money.</p>
<p>This kind of card game under the guidance of the Japanese Army Ministry is similar to the second type, but the nature is different. These cards depict soldiers who died in battle in the three northeastern provinces or Shanghai, along with the ferocious and ugly appearances of "Chinese people." The stories told are about the bravery of a certain sergeant in killing the enemy and his honorable death in battle, and how the "Chinese people" are ferocious, unreasonable, and deserving of death! Japanese people must love their country and prepare for war, and so on. The Japanese military strictly guides and controls those engaged in this business. Currently, there are 2,000 people doing this business in Tokyo alone, and more than 20,000 throughout the country. The ambition of the Japanese nation and the intentions of the Japanese military (the representative body of the warlords) can be imagined. (But rewarded)</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Story of Tobacco <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yi Wu</p>
<p>Tobacco has now spread throughout the world, and many people smoke it. However, its history is not very long. Like opium, it was first discovered in the Ming Dynasty, and it was also not a domestic product. It was initially brought into China from Luzon, and later China began to cultivate it. Gradually, it spread throughout the provinces. It is also known as "Danbagu" or "tobacco grass," about three feet tall, with blue-green flowers in the shape of a funnel. The leaves are used to make tobacco, so it is commonly called tobacco grass, which can be made into various types of tobacco. The most popular cigarettes now are one of these types. The other day, I happened to be talking to a friend, Mr. So-and-so, when I heard a story saying that tobacco did indeed only exist in the Ming Dynasty. But it was not introduced from a foreign country. At that time, there was a man named Shi who was betrothed to a woman named Ma. Before the wedding ceremony could take place, Ma suddenly died. Shi was very grieved and vowed never to marry for the rest of his life, crying at Ma's tomb morning and evening, regardless of wind, frost, rain, or snow, without interruption. A kind of grass grew on the tomb, just like planted tobacco. At that time, Shi naturally did not know it was tobacco, but he felt a strange fragrance. One day, because he was so grief-stricken, he suddenly felt dizzy and had a stomachache, and fell to the ground in front of the tomb, unable to get up. He casually picked a leaf and put it in his nostril. Before long, he was no longer dizzy or in pain, but instead felt refreshed. When others found out, they all said that it was a transformation of his blood and tears. Whenever anyone had a disease, they would pick a leaf and eat it as medicine, and it would always cure them immediately. Thus, the story spread, and everyone regarded it as an immortal herb. They planted it, and gradually the planting became widespread, and it became tobacco. In the beginning, opium was also very precious. Siam had used it as tribute, and only the emperor could enjoy it. Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty loved it the most and became addicted to it. But when China began to cultivate it itself, it became extremely democratized and turned into a raging flood. Tobacco has narcotic properties and can relieve fatigue, so people smoke it even more widely and quickly. In fact, it is also a poison, containing nicotine, which is very harmful to health. Except for China, which absolutely does not prohibit it, other countries have bans on it for minors.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Preparations for the Chinese Art Exhibition in Berlin (Part 2) <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Baishi</p>
<p>In the spring of the twentieth year [of the Republic], the Chinese painter Liu Haisu was invited by the Chinese Academy of the city of Frankfurt, Germany, to lecture on Chinese painting. He also held a Chinese modern painting exhibition at the Frankfurt Art Museum, which was moved to Heidelberg in June. The impact at that time was greater than expected. This was because in the early spring of that year, the Japanese had held a large-scale exhibition in Berlin, so Europeans felt that Oriental art was merely imitating Western art superficially and had not shown its unique characteristics. But when they saw the Chinese modern painting exhibition, they were surprised and praised it endlessly. This was because its simplicity and naturalness, devoid of artificiality, was different from the Japanese works that were labored and fraudulent. The embassy saw that German newspapers were also carrying articles about the need to hold a Chinese modern painting exhibition in Berlin, so they telegraphed to urge Liu to go to Berlin. They formally negotiated with the Prussian Academy of Arts and the Oriental Art Society, and had detailed discussions with oriental scholars, professors at the University of Berlin such as Komeru and Hewrey, the vice president of the Academy of Arts Professor Armer Adolf, and the professor of the Polytechnic University, Barschimen. Finally, the embassy formally agreed with the German side to hold the exhibition in February 1934, using the Prussian Academy of Arts as the exhibition site, and recommended ten German committee members: one representative from the German Foreign Ministry, the chairman of the German Oriental Art Association and former German ambassador to Japan, Dr. Scharvu, the vice chairman of the German Oriental Art Association, Dr. Klenprei, the secretary general of the German Oriental Art Association, the curator of the Oriental Museum and professor at the University of Berlin, Dr. Komeru, the deputy secretary general of the German Oriental Art Association and the director of the National Museum, Kong William, the professor of the Berlin University of Technology and government architectural consultant, Bai Shumen, the curator of the National Art Library and professor at the University of Berlin, Dr. Krachou, the chief accountant of the German Oriental Art Association, Dr. Silverberg, the deputy chief accountant of the German Oriental Art Association, Count Heitou, and the secretary general of the Prussian Academy of Arts and professor at the University of Berlin, Dr. Armer Adolf.</p>
<p>These negotiations took several twists and turns. Once the outline was in place, Liu began to vigorously advocate for artists in the country to work together to achieve success, so as not to let the Japanese usurp the position of master of the Orient.</p>

<p>Elder Sanyuan, Mr. Chen Boyan, is peerless in his morality and writing in the current era. Old literati in the country regard him as a great master within the nation. In recent years, he has secluded himself in Mount Lu, where his cultivation is deep. He is already eighty years old. I heard that his solitary birthday celebration is approaching. Famous scholars and worthies intend to celebrate the elder's birthday and are competing to compose poems and articles. Soon, those dazzling compositions will glorify the Southeast region, making it a grand event in the Chinese literary world. Yesterday, I saw a congratulatory couplet handwritten by Mr. Li Liejun, expressing the utmost respect for the virtuous and venerable. The couplet reads:</p>
<p>A long life is naturally an auspicious omen among men.</p>

<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>According to news from New York, a sound expert named Mr. Ray Kelley is seeking a young couple who are good at kissing. Seeking talent is not unusual in itself, but seeking kissing talent is something we have never heard of. He is seeking this kind of talent to produce a sound film scene. His standard for selection is that the couple can only have their lips touching when they kiss, and the sound of the lips touching is recorded by radio. From an artistic point of view, Mr. Kelley's purpose is to study the sound of kissing. When he was studying it, he used an oak stopper to rub on a piece of glass coated with rosin, wanting to use it to replace the sound of kissing, but the sound produced was completely different from kissing, so he had to seek a young couple who were good at kissing.</p>

<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>A Shandong man in his fifties stood at the iron gate of the underground chamber, soliciting people to take a tour. I spent three "Mao tickets" to hire him as a guide. Stepping down the stone steps into the underground chamber, I felt a chill on my body, as if entering late autumn. In a narrow, long tunnel made of cement, it was so dark that you couldn't see your fingers, and the ground was wet. If it weren't for a lantern and a small wind lamp to illuminate the way, we really couldn't have moved an inch. As he walked, he pointed out this room and that room, explaining this and that to us. On the left wall of the wounded soldiers' room, there were many bloody handprints. These were left by German wounded soldiers when the Japanese army attacked this fort. I wonder if these wounded soldiers eventually died in this gloomy and desolate basement, or were able to safely withdraw and return to their homeland to live a peaceful life again. These things can no longer be asked, and I'm afraid even the "guide" wouldn't know. Further on, there was a room that he said was used by German expatriate women and children to take refuge during the war, because at that time, bullets were raining down around the fort, and it was extremely dangerous to live outside. Immediately, a scene of mothers and children embracing each other in fear and trembling appeared in my mind. Having experienced the disaster of the Zhabei battle, like a startled bird, I involuntarily trembled again here!</p>
<p>Japanese Bathhouses. Qingdao's bathhouses all have women's bathhouses attached, and all the facilities are the same as those for men. This has given Chinese women, who have never paid much attention to cleanliness, more opportunities to bathe, which is commendable. But Japanese bathhouses have another advantage: that is, the price is particularly cheap, allowing everyone to develop the habit of frequent bathing.</p>
<p>Walking into a Japanese bathhouse, men and women part ways and enter through separate doors. You have to bring your own towel and soap. First, pay the bill (only six cents per person), and then go to bathe. Inside, there is a pool. First, use a basin to scoop water and wipe your whole body clean, then soak in the pool to remove all the dirt, and you're done.</p>

<p>Episode Eleven: Peeking at the Official Banners in a Remote County, Scolding the Mean Currents of the Crowd</p>
<p>Although Fourth Master Wu was busy with this big affair, he took advantage of being associated with these two noble guests to return to his hometown and feel very proud. He intended to show off his talent and boast of his glory, and would never shirk the slightest bit of laziness, nor feel the slightest bit of fatigue. At this time, his energy became stronger with use, and he even put in extra effort to inspect each room again to see if all the arrangements were complete. After looking, he admired his own orderliness and felt even more pleased. He became even less inclined to sleep and strolled outside. He saw Qin the accountant in the accounting room, accompanying several bailiffs from the county government, talking and chatting. He guessed that they must have come to inquire about the news, so he approached to exaggerate a little more for the public to know. He puffed out his big belly, entered the room, pretended to be tipsy, and laughed loudly, saying, "Oh, Accountant Qin, what are you talking about with these gentlemen? Could it be that you are talking about me behind my back?" Qin the accountant and the others hurriedly stood up, smiled apologetically, and offered him a seat, saying, "Fourth Master, you went to the provincial capital and came back with these two important figures. We heard that there is even a big commander among them. His official position must be very high. We thought, now that Fourth Master has met benefactors, he will surely be promoted." Fourth Master sat down proudly and chuckled, saying, "I knew you would say that I was doing a good job. To be honest, my trip to the provincial capital was a lucky opportunity. I got to know this amazing Commander An. His title has the characters 'jade' above and 'field' below. When we started talking about family matters, I found out that he was from Anjia Village, the most famous village in our neighboring county. I even have some distant relatives from his side. This gentleman graduated from Peking University and is accomplished in both literary and military affairs. I also heard that he is related to Grand Marshal Ye by marriage, so Grand Marshal Ye sent him to our county to handle the pacification work and establish an army. When he has recruited enough people, he will return to the province and have a good chance of becoming a military governor. I met this gentleman by chance, and he thought highly of me and insisted on having me help him. He promised me the position of chief of staff, entrusting me with all matters, big and small. He truly listens to everything I say and follows every plan I make. I don't know why we get along so well."</p>

<h3 id="e135">Gold Standard Continues to Decline <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>With a fluctuation of ten taels. Yesterday, the gold standard continued to weaken, with violent waves and panic among traders, making it difficult to predict. There were ten taels of fluctuation throughout the day, later falling about three taels. It was initially stable, and the silver market did not move. Afterward, the price rose by six or seven taels. At noon, there was a sudden drop, because a major player dumped long positions, and Hengxing also seemed to have sold, causing a weakening. The price plummeted by eight or nine taels in an instant, finally breaking the 750 tael mark. As for foreign exchange, it was still peaceful, with the market fluctuating around 50 taels. In short, people were confused and uncertain, and finally settled within 50 taels. The details of the market situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Weakness Before Noon Closes: Opening at 751 taels and three mace in the early morning, slightly up by two cash. However, the public telegram for silver prices remained the same, while the private telegram rose by one-eighth. When it fell back to 49 taels, it was bought by Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongtongchang, and others to cover positions, and the price rose by four taels to 53 taels. However, HSBC released October U.S. dollars at 30.0625 yuan, and Hengchang, Yongshunli, and others sold, causing a decline of two taels. At 9:15, it was 51 taels. Then, the bank absorbed September British gold at 93.75, and Mitsui absorbed October U.S. dollars from 30 yuan to 29.9375 yuan. As more buyers entered the market, Yuankang, Xianghengchang, Yonglai bought in, reaching 55 taels at 9:30. British and American banks did not change their rates, remaining at 4.5 taels. In a moment, it rose by more than two taels, because Zhifeng, Yongfutai, Hengyuan, Dayong, Yuanmao, Yongyuanheng, Yuantai, and others showed strong buying interest, mainly because more U.S. dollars were settled. The July rate was only 29.5 yuan, September 8.125, and Mitsui absorbed August 6.25 and October 8.75, reaching 56 taels and eight mace at 9:50. Later, Qianchang, Hongli, Dadecheng, Hengchangyong, Bingxing, and others sold, causing a drop of four taels. At 10:20, it was 52.5 taels. Afterward, it rose sharply, as Daxing, Yongfuyu, Hongkang, Yonghongxing, Hongli, Xiexing, Yongtongchang, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuanmaoyuyu, and others competed to buy in succession, causing the market price to rise frequently by more than four taels. From 10:30 to 11:30, there was a fluctuation of more than one tael, until 11:45, when it reached 57 taels and one mace. In an instant, a sudden storm appeared, because Yifeng, Yonghengyu, and others representing Yufengyong, old longs exited the market. Hengxing, Bingxing, Yongfeng, Dadecheng, Hongli, Tongchun, Tongtaichang, and others followed suit, and the exchange rate was flat. In just over ten minutes, it plummeted by nine taels, with only one tael of consolidation in an instant, until 11:56-57, finally reaching 48 taels. At this time, Daxing, Yonghengxing, and Bingxing bought in, jumping up by three taels in one minute to 51 taels, but the closing price was calculated at 49 taels, and the selling pressure did not cease. Ordinary retail investors hurriedly closed out their positions, causing it to drop to 46-47 taels. Fuxingyong and others dragged it in, raising it again by two or three taels to 49 taels and some cash.</p>
<p>Resulting in a Drop of 2 Taels and 8 Mace: The aftermarket opened at 48.5 taels. Yuanxingyong, Tongtaichang, and others bought in, reaching 49 taels and eight mace. Zhifengyong, Fuyu Shunli, and others sold again, causing a decline of more than two taels, reaching 47 taels. At 2:20, the buying side seemed diligent, and Citibank cabled in U.S. dollar prices for July and August, calculated at 75. Maijiali also absorbed July at 6.875. Guangbang Yifeng, Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Yuankangxiang, and others bought in, presenting a good situation, breaking through 50 taels. At 2:45, it was 51 taels and seven mace. Afterward, Hengxing Yifeng Yonglai exited, Huabi released September U.S. dollars at 8.75, and HSBC released October British gold at 1.7875, reaching 48 taels and one mace at 3:00. Hongli Yifeng bought in, pulling up two or three taels, and it was 50 taels and nine cash. Suddenly, it went down again, because Hengyu, Fuyu, Fuxingyong, Hengchangyong, Dadecheng, and others sold a lot, as the U.S. dollar seemed to loosen, with October settling at 30 yuan. At 3:30, it fell to 47 taels for the second time. In an instant, Bingxing and others dragged it in, and at 4:00, it was 49 taels and six mace. HSBC absorbed July U.S. dollars at 29.75 yuan. Afterward, Fuyu Qianchangxiang and general retail customers hurriedly spat it out, and the price fell by another tael. At 4:20, it was 48 taels. By the time the market closed at 4:30, it was 48 taels and three mace, continuing to fall by 2 taels and 8 mace compared to last Saturday. After the closing, it was done again at around 49 taels. Goods were traded at a premium of seven cash. According to the daily maximum of 57 taels and one mace and the minimum of 47 taels, there was a difference of 10 taels and one cash. Counting the difference, it was plus nine taels and seven and a half cash.</p>
<p>Quotation Suppressed by 72-73 Taels: The quoted price was still 820 taels, because the U.S. dollar did not change, and the premium was 64-65 taels, then 71-72 taels.

<p>Due to the securities settlement for this month approaching, it was anticipated that a large amount of cash would be released. However, as the demand was not robust, speculators with unique ideas engaged in short selling, exploiting people's psychology. This led to an unprecedented low of nine-tenths of a cent the day before yesterday. By yesterday morning, the situation reversed, and the market gradually improved. As a result, there was a slight increase of half a cent between the two markets. The interbank lending rate gradually rose slightly and was very tight, indicating a potential rise in credit.</p>
<p>Slight Increase in Interbank Lending Rates: The morning interbank lending rate for "foreign exchange" was 6.9025 cents, and the afternoon rate was 6.90375 cents. This resulted in a half-cent increase compared to the previous day's afternoon rate. The "interbank lending" situation gradually improved, rising one cent daily. Yesterday, it rose another cent, totaling 1.3 cents. The morning and afternoon rates were the same, with no changes. The bank's listed rate was 5 cents, but with added water, it was only 2.67 cents, and the final closing rate was 1.56 cents.</p>
<p>Jiangjiao Sudden Drop in the Afternoon: The morning rate for Jiangnan small silver dollars was 5.92 cents, similar to the day before yesterday.

The morning rate for Guangdong small silver dollars was 5.84625 cents, and the afternoon rate was 5.84875 cents. The trading volume was 140,000 jiao in the morning and 100,500 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins remained at the old price of 425,000 wen.</p>
<p>Increased Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars: Yesterday, being Monday, the banks were open, so various receipts and payments were more frequent than usual.

<h3 id="e139">Auction of Securities and Bonds for August Delivery Starts Today <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>June Delivery Halted in Preparation for Settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market Was Quiet, with Prices Dropping by Six or Seven Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange halted trading in June futures to prepare for settlement. Therefore, only July futures were traded. The market was quiet, and trading activity was subdued. The morning trading volume was only over 900,000, and the afternoon volume was about 1.3 million, totaling 2.23 million yuan. Of this, salt tax bonds accounted for 555,000 yuan, consolidated tax bonds and customs bonds each accounted for over 300,000 yuan, and other bonds accounted for about 200,000 yuan. Spot transactions totaled 30,000 yuan, with central troop disbandment bonds accounting for 15,000 yuan, and other bonds accounting for only a few thousand yuan. The trend of various bonds was that market sentiment was cold, purchases were scarce, and demand was weak, leading to an oversupply and a general decline in prices. However, the fluctuations were moderate. Compared to last week, spot 1920 customs bonds fell by 1.5 yuan, and the entire 6th-period futures also fell by a small amount of 1.5 jiao. Other bonds mostly fell by about six or seven jiao, indicating a rather weak trend. Trading in August futures will begin today. The bond prices and trading volumes are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e140">Yarn and Cotton Market Trend: Rise Followed by Decline <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market experienced an initial rise followed by a decline, with a relatively calm trend. This contrasts with the instability of the previous day. The reason is that the trend is such that when prices rise, new short sellers increase, and no single entity can sustain the price. However, most people in Shanghai believe that the bottom has been reached and are keen to buy, providing strong upward momentum. Overall, the domestic economy is depleted, rural areas are declining, and people's livelihoods are suffering, leading to a significant reduction in cotton yarn consumption. In addition, Japanese merchants are competing to sell at particularly low prices, making it even more difficult for Chinese yarn. However, a major player has recently switched from short to long positions, temporarily restraining the market. The afternoon market suddenly weakened.</p>
<p>After the Exchange Session, the Market Weakened: At the opening of the Exchange session, American cotton was flat, and the situation in Guangdong waters was tense. Each month fell by six or seven qian in the first two or three rounds. Due to the firmness of the cotton market, it rose again by six, seven, or eight qian. As a result, each month rose by three to six qian. In the afternoon, news spread that manufacturers were hedging, causing the market to decline round by round, with each month falling by one, two, or four qian. The total trading volume for the day was 31,100 bales. It was found that Gengfeng sold 2,650 bales, Taichang 950 bales, Yida 800 bales, Dachang 700 bales, Yukang 1,100 bales, and Mingde 1,500 bales.

<p>Mediocre Clearance of Spot Yarn: The clearance of spot yarn was mediocre. The Yunnanese brokers were still keen on buying futures. It was found that all brokers bought a total of 1,100 bales of spot and futures yarn. The market was flat. Among the out-of-town brokers, Changsha bought 10 bales, Shantou 180 bales, Xiamen 30 bales, inland areas 30 bales, Ningbo 5 bales, Guangdong 275 bales, Yunnan 550 bales, Wuhu 15 bales, Fujian 20 bales, Jiangxi 20 bales, and Haizhou 5 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Cotton Merchants Tend to Take Long Positions <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market trend is relatively stable, and most people tend to take long positions, buying and holding. This is because the torrential rise in the Yangtze River's water level is a cause for concern, and there is talk that the deal for the US cotton to be sold on credit to our country may not go through. As a result, the situation in the market is becoming tighter, but actual business remains sluggish. Factories have no demand. As for the matter of buying US cotton on credit, all the contracts and procedures are quite troublesome and cannot be resolved in a moment. However, it is not a problem for the market. It was found that from last year to April of this year, imports of foreign cotton have already reached 1.2 million bales. Whether or not this 600,000 bale deal is successful does not have a special relationship in fact. The afternoon market showed slight signs of weakness, probably due to the easing of gold prices.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Up Three or Four Qian: At the opening of the Zheng Biao session, the rising water level of the Yangtze River caused anxiety, and there were few sellers. Each month rose by four or five qian. The market weakened again in the afternoon, falling by one or two qian. The total trading volume for the day was 48,300 dan. It was found that Delong sold 1,500 dan, Yuanda 1,000 dan, Hengde 1,600 dan, Changfeng 1,300 dan, and Xincheng 1,700 dan. Shenchang bought 4,100 dan, Hengyi 1,600 dan, Yu Chang 1,200 dan, Yi Chang 2,700 dan, and Tongxing 2,200 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Zheng Biao | Closing Price | Change | Account Balance |</p>
<p>| -------- | ------------- | ------ | --------------- |</p>
<p>| October  | 2865          | Up 35  | 153,200         |</p>

<p>Continued Sluggish Consumption of Raw Cotton: Spot cotton business remains sluggish. According to the sources at the docks, there were 1,564 bales of Yao cotton. Hubei brokers sold 1,500 pieces of Shaanxi cotton to the Shenxin factory at a price of 27.05 taels.</p>

<p>Bombay: Last week's futures market weakened due to favorable monsoon conditions. Bai Luo Creek cotton prices gradually converged between near and distant periods due to good cotton harvests and local selling. In terms of spot goods, holders remain firm. There is no progress in demand from Europe and the Far East. Japanese shippers are buying Olmra cotton daily, and local manufacturers' transportation is also improving. The following is a summary of last week's statistics (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Liverpool: Last week, spot demand was weak. Futures were quiet and firm due to the general belief that the Lausanne Conference would have satisfactory results and news of excessive rainfall and insect damage in US cotton. Although there is no change in the current business volume, cotton cloth has been reduced in many consumption centers around the world. Egyptian cotton prices have exceeded the price of US cotton due to continuous purchases in Alexandria.</p>

<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday's rice market saw supplies from various brokers reaching around the 15th or 16th, but the stored heat in Pudong remained significant. Retail sales in urban and rural stores seemed calmer as the weather cleared. Thick japonica rice prices stabilized first, while thin indica rice arrivals were scarce, but sluggish sales kept market prices stable. Foreign-produced refined rice was rare and somewhat sluggish, trending downward. Around 1,500 shi of Pudong rice husks were available.</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday's rice market in Xin Zha saw arrivals from around the 20th or 30th due to unfavorable weather. The trend was a slump. Changshu northern japonica rice and early and late indica rice</p>
<p>Opening prices decreased by 0.05 yuan. Foreign-produced refined rice, due to consecutive days of sharp declines, was sure to be scarce. Large shipments were stable, and some fine rice arrivals were sluggish in demand, trending downward. Rice wine producers had extremely high demand, keeping conditions firm.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Foreign Rice Indica Market Settles <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market for Wenzhou indica rice was temporarily stable. Due to few arrivals in recent days and no long-term futures orders, cargo owners reluctantly sold at a loss, temporarily supporting the market. However, transactions remained slow. The Consolidated Market opened with 1,500 bags of small pressed rice, of which 500 bags were taken by inland brokers, with the rest being received by brokers on this street. Prices opened between 9.65 and 9.53 yuan. Another 100 bags of red small pressed rice were priced at 9.10 yuan, also received by brokers on this street. Yesterday, brokers on this street had strong appetites. In addition to handling a small amount of foreign rice, 2,000 bags of Wenzhou white rice were traded at prices between 8.87 and 8.75 yuan, and another 100 bags of brown rice were priced at 8.40 yuan. The market conditions were similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Flour Mills Incessantly Issuing <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, saw market conditions for each month generally stable. Foreign wheat prices were good, up to 0.14 yuan, and the weather was cold, keeping people calm. Prices were up about 0.01 yuan compared to the previous weekend. However, small and medium-sized factories and Fuxin mills continuously issued offers, totaling about 70,000 to 80,000 bags. By the afternoon opening, prices were initially stable, but the attitude of major factories had changed, and they continuously issued offers for both near and distant periods, causing the market to decline sharply. Observing the subsequent steps, it is feared that it will be difficult to be optimistic, as current sales have not been strong and factories are competing to issue endlessly. As a result, July fell by a small amount of 0.025 yuan compared to the previous weekend, August fell by 0.075 yuan, September fell by 0.01 yuan, October fell by 0.0125 yuan, and November fell by 0.075 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Sharp Decline in Wheat Futures Market <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw prices remain stable, with foreign wheat quotes rising by about 0.24 yuan, keeping outside investors quite stable. However, Datong and Xinfeng and other firms took advantage of this good opportunity to gradually issue offers on all their long positions, causing market conditions to be stable but stagnant. By the afternoon opening, the market plunged again, with Dingtai mills gradually issuing their long positions. In addition, the weather had turned clear, making investors more apprehensive. July fell sharply step by step, while August also fell. The decline in distant periods was smaller. As a result, July fell by 0.09 yuan compared to the previous weekend, August fell by 0.07 yuan, September fell by 0.05 yuan, October fell by 0.03 yuan, and the rest were not opened. The spot wheat market remained stable, as Fuxin Huafeng and other mills still had demand, stabilizing sentiment. Lai wheat opened at 2.94 taels, Anding wheat at 2.90 taels, Hengjing wheat at 2.95 taels, Shuangfeng wheat at 2.96 taels, and Huojiaqiao wheat at 2.80 taels, Baihegang wheat at 2.90 taels, totaling more than 1,400 bags.</p>

<p>High-quality walnuts previously reached 24-25 taels, but have gradually declined due to sluggish sales. Local prices have relaxed successively, so the current selling price is 7-8 taels lower than the highest price. Currently, top-grade Zhuang walnuts are only selling for 15-16 taels, Shen Zhuang walnuts for 13-14 taels, and second-grade Zhuang walnuts for 11-12 taels. The market is flat and weak.</p>

<p>Raw Sugar and White Sugar Markets Strengthen Again</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw brisk transactions at the Sugar Exchange, and market conditions were firm. Dutch sugar #24 raw white sugar traded at 14.2 taels, Hong Kong sugar at 14 taels, Dutch oil bag #9 raw red sugar at 9.8 taels, and #24 medium white sugar was quoted at 13.8 taels, while raw red sugar was quoted at 12 taels. For a time, there were few buyers and firm conditions. Taikoo sugar B mark traded at 16.2 taels, CW mark at 15.8 taels, DY mark at 15.5 taels, HX mark at 15.3 taels, HM mark at 14.9 taels, and H mark at 12.4 taels. Trading was brisk, with stable and popular trends. The Zhendianghao firm sold 500 bags of Hong Kong raw white sugar at 14 taels, which was quite popular. Our factory's crystal flower green was quoted at a higher price of 11.5 taels, but many buyers were still watching, and transactions were quiet.</p>

<p>Prices Will Fall to 90 Taels</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese silk waste (i.e., silk scraps) has been relentlessly sold cheaply in European and American markets, regardless of cost, selling as soon as a price is offered. This has caused our country's silk waste sales to be almost completely taken over, and the market has plummeted, with no one inquiring. European firms are taking advantage of this to stockpile cheaply. Yesterday, firms such as Xinfu continued to buy 20 dan of Wuxi silk factory silk waste at a price that is about to fall to 90 taels, a decline of 50-60 taels compared to last year.</p>
<h3 id="e150">No European or American Silk Telegrams Received <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Only French Firms Replenished White Factory Silk by 10 Bales Yesterday, the local foreign silk market remained sluggish. The factory and top-grade telegrams sent by various European and American firms in the middle of last week to New York, Lyon, London, etc., were not mentioned yesterday morning. The market was quiet. Yesterday, only the French firm Dachang replenished 10 bales of top-grade Shanghai white factory silk of the B grade from the top 11th to 15th strands at a price of 575 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firms' tea market saw that black tea from Qimen and Ningzhou, and green tea from local and rural firms, were all selling well. Chinese tea merchants, seeing that the Russian Aid Association has been established and knowing that the firm's sales volume this year will be larger than in the past, have hardened their attitudes. There were negotiations for Zhenmei tea at firms such as Yihua, Jinlong, and Tianxiang. Transactions in needle tea and pearl tea were also brisk. The long-sluggish green tea market seems to be turning around.</p>

<p>Trading in metals is quite slow in this season of economic hardship. Although various companies have been trying their best to promote sales, the pressure from the poor economic environment has resulted in little improvement in actual transactions. However, there was some activity from brokers in the Yangtze River area, such as Anqing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, and Nanjing. Therefore, over 1,300-1,400 dan of goods were sold. Prices for common items such as green lead and tinplate fell slightly by 0.01 yuan, while English steel plate, French nails, plain white iron, and new lead wire fell slightly by 0.005 yuan. Other items such as new cowhide, triangular iron, and white lead sheet remained largely unchanged. In addition, business from Fujian, which is usually substantial, was scarce due to unrest in the area and extremely tight credit.</p>

<p>The textile market has seen a sharp decline in prices over the past half month, the most severe in recent times. This is because Eastern goods have become more active and are selling at very low prices. In addition, American cotton prices have continued to fall, resulting in a slump. Prices for coarse and fine cloths from local factories, except for twills, have fallen by as much as 1 tael per bolt. Holders have suffered great losses. Subsequently, it is now the time of year when supplies are low and demand is high, making it even more difficult to move goods. Therefore, it is feared that there will be no turnaround in the short term. The following is a list of prices for the previous month and current market prices (in taels):</p>
<p>| Weight (lb) | Coarse Cloth     | Current Price | Previous Month Price | Weight (lb) | Fine Cloth   | Current Price | Previous Month Price |</p>

<h3 id="e154">City Chamber of Commerce Cables Foreign Envoys to Negotiate on Northeast Tariffs <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Requests Recognition of Japanese as Principal Party</p>
<p>Due to the Japanese seizing our Northeast tariffs by using a puppet state, the City Chamber of Commerce has cabled the British, American, French, and Italian envoys in Beijing, requesting serious negotiations. The cable reads: "The seizure of customs duties from the three northeastern provinces and the Dalian Customs, located in the Japanese leased territory, by the Manchurian puppet state created by the Japanese, has caused serious concern among creditors, both Chinese and foreign. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs claims that this is a matter for the Manchurian government, but publicly expresses sympathy for this action. The Dalian Customs Commissioner, Mr. Fukumoto, openly admits that his actions were prompted by warnings from responsible Japanese authorities, further proving that this was directed by the Japanese. As the three northeastern provinces are purely under Japanese military occupation, the so-called important officials of the Manchurian state are concurrently serving as personnel of the Kwantung Army and consuls, and have become integrated with Japan. This action is merely intended to pressure China and its allies with financial disputes by negotiating with the so-called Manchurian state, thereby achieving de facto recognition and undermining the purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty. We respectfully request that all allies recognize that the Japanese are the principal party in this matter, conduct serious negotiations, maintain the unified customs system, and prevent its destruction. As Japan is the creator of the Manchurian state and a creditor with customs guarantees, it cannot be allowed to evade or deny responsibility." Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Yangtze River Flooding Causes Disaster <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Ganzhou and Hunan Areas Already Submerged</p>
<p>Flood Relief Committee Discusses Measures Yesterday</p>
<p>This spring, the Yangtze River has experienced continuous rain, causing the river to rise significantly. Last month, the river rose to 32.5 feet in Hankou, causing widespread panic. The tragic scene of last year's submersion is being repeated this year. The engineering department of the Flood Relief Committee has allocated 660,000 yuan for disaster relief to build long embankments to prevent flooding. However, due to continuous torrential rains, the Yangtze River has risen several more feet, and Ganzhou and Hunan areas have already been submerged. The following is a report based on what our reporters have learned:</p>
<p>Central Hunan Submerged: Yesterday, our local office received a telegram from Hunan, stating that on the 26th, Changsha experienced continuous heavy rain and the river rose sharply, exceeding 35 feet. The river in Changsha has submerged the shore, and the Nissin Company branch has moved to Xiangtan. Warehouses in lower areas have already been flooded. In the Shashi area, the river level was even with the riverbank on the 26th. If it rises further, the riverbank will also be submerged. Currently, various shipping companies and warehouses are moving goods to higher ground. Yiyang and Changde were also submerged in floodwaters on the 26th.</p>
<p>Ganzhou and Xunzhou Roads Blocked: On the 26th, the water level in Jiujiang was 37 feet, almost level with the riverbank. Due to continuous heavy rain and rising water, the dikes along the Shuanglin, Changhu, Guangfu, Anle, and Shangfu rivers in Ganzhou and Fu County have been breached in several places by floodwaters. Countless homes and fields have been submerged. The Nanzun road has been completely blocked by floodwaters and is impassable.</p>
<p>Recent Conditions in Anhui and Hubei: The water level in Anqing in northern Anhui reached 33 feet 5 inches yesterday, while the water level in Wuhu in southern Anhui reached 33 feet 6 inches. The engineering department is accelerating the construction of flood prevention embankments and increasing the number of inspectors to prevent them from being washed away by floodwaters. In Hankou, the water level rose to 32.5 feet last month, but then gradually receded, easing people's fears. However, it rose more than 3 feet overnight on the 26th, exceeding 35 feet 5 inches yesterday. The highest level reached 38 feet. Fortunately, the Wutai sluice gate was built early and is solid, preventing a breach. However, if it rises further, it will still be dangerous. Yesterday, the local Flood Relief Committee held an emergency meeting to discuss disaster relief and response measures.</p>
<p>Transportation Disrupted: Due to continuous flooding, several ports in Hunan and Ganzhou have been submerged. Yesterday, local shipping companies received telegrams from Hunan and Ganzhou stating that goods being shipped to Changsha, Yiyang, Changde, and other places in Hunan have been halted due to floodwaters. Goods being shipped to the interior of Ganzhou Province have also been temporarily suspended due to the Nanzun road being blocked by floodwaters. As a result, exports from Shanghai to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have been greatly reduced.</p>
<h3 id="e156">The National Government Flood Relief Committee to Conclude on July 1st <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Concluding Committee to be Organized and Staffed to Preside; Unfinished Matters to Continue Until Completion</p>
<p>The National Government Flood Relief Committee, which held a standing committee meeting on the 18th of this month, proposed to begin the winding down of various departments and agencies from July 1st of this year. However, unfinished work would continue. The proposal was passed, and the committee chairman, Mr. T.V. Soong, convened a plenary session of the committee at the Central Bank Finance Department office at 2:30 PM yesterday to decide that the committee would begin its conclusion from July 1st. However, all unfinished matters would still be handled responsibly. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees Yesterday The attendees at yesterday's meeting included Committee Chairman T.V. Soong, committee members Zhang Shouyong, Liu Ruiheng, Wang Xiao, Shi Liangcai, Baker, Zheng Lai, Zhu Ziqiao, Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Zhang Gongquan, Wei Wenbin, Xi Dejiong, Zha Liangzhao, Anders, Lin Kanghou, Guo Dehua, and more than fifty others.</p>
<p>Chairman Soong's Address National Government Flood Relief Committee Chairman Soong delivered the opening remarks, stating: "Esteemed committee members, the initial work report of this committee since its establishment has been compiled and is now available for your reference. The resolution of the Standing Committee on June 18th is also submitted today for your discussion. You will recall that at the first general meeting of this committee on September 9th last year, I stated that the scale of this flood was unprecedented in history. It might be possible to alleviate it slightly, but it would be impossible to completely avoid it. At that time, I also said that the way to provide relief should be through the joint efforts of public and private sectors. However, in any case, funds are limited, so the use of funds should be very careful. It is better to choose the main work and focus on it to achieve the greatest effect, and do not overextend, resulting in diminishing returns. At that time, the committee decided on the following measures: the first step was emergency relief work, to provide as much relief as possible to the people in the disaster area, providing clothing, food, housing, and sanitation. The second step was, after the flood receded, to repair the embankments that were washed away by the flood as far as financial resources allowed, and to increase their height and solidity to prevent future flooding of the Yangtze River under normal water flow. The final work was to save money to help with spring plowing and post-disaster farmland reconstruction. The most important of these tasks is embankment construction. With the completion of the embankments, emergency relief funds will not be wasted, and post-disaster farmland reconstruction will also be easier. The opinion of the Standing Committee is that the main work within the committee's economic capacity has been 90% successful according to the original plan. Unfinished work has also been planned and can be carried out step by step, so there was the resolution of June 18th. The amount of work of this committee depends on the financial situation. When the committee was first established, in addition to private donations, some people in the community believed that the government should issue 80 million yuan in disaster relief bonds to purchase wheat from the three northeastern provinces for disaster relief. However, the persons in charge of this committee all believed that the market was sluggish and there was no power to absorb this huge amount of bonds. The yield of wheat in the eastern provinces depended on transportation, weather, personnel, and other factors, so its effectiveness could not be guaranteed. Therefore, after many discussions, it was decided to adopt the following methods: (1) Purchase surplus wheat from the United States on credit with long-term payments; (2) Raise private donations; (3) Impose a surtax on customs duties. After the above methods were decided, they were implemented one by one. The facts of the past few months are enough to prove that the committee's methods were correct. On September 25th last year, the National Government officially signed an agreement with the U.S. government to purchase 15 million bushels of American wheat and flour on credit, valued at US$9,212,828.46, which is approximately 43,000,000 yuan in national currency at the current exchange rate. This debt will be repaid with a 5% ad valorem surtax, which will be levied from August 1st of this year until it is paid off. Private donations have reached 7,387,400 yuan in national currency since the fundraising began. There are many voluntary disaster relief organizations established by private individuals in various parts of the country, which have absorbed a large amount of donations. In addition, the world economy is depressed, and the violent Japanese have repeatedly invaded our territory, first attacking the eastern provinces and then committing crimes in Shanghai. All of these factors have affected fundraising, but it is gratifying that this achievement has been made. Due to the sluggish market for government bonds, it was decided to withdraw the proposed 30 million yuan in disaster relief bonds and instead levy a 10% surtax on customs duties for a period of eight months, from December 1st last year to July 31st this year. From the beginning of the levy to June 20th, the income from this surtax has reached 12,131,555 yuan in national currency. The budget set by the committee at the first general meeting in September last year was 70,000,000 yuan in national currency, and the committee's income from public and private donations, including American wheat, is approximately 65,000,000 yuan in national currency, so the difference between the budget and the actual number is not much. On the expenditure side of the committee, one-third of the American wheat was used for emergency relief, agricultural relief, and subsidies for the repair of private embankments, and the remaining two-thirds were used for embankment construction wages. Other expenses were also not much different from the budget resolved in the general meeting in September last year. Transportation costs were slightly lower than the budget. In addition, there were many places in the disaster area where transportation was difficult, so some of the wheat was exchanged for cash to facilitate convenience. The flood last year was unprecedented in history, so there was no precedent for this kind of huge relief work. The staff were also temporarily recruited from various parts of the country. Among them were engineers, accountants, and doctors from public and private institutions, students from various schools who could serve as surveyors and investigators, missionaries with rich disaster relief experience and familiarity with local conditions, and grain depot staff temporarily hired. Mistakes in the work were inevitable. However, the committee dares to assert that even if there are mistakes in the work, they are mostly due to lack of experience and not due to errors of conscience. What is most noteworthy is that the expenditure of 65,000,000 yuan was not involved in political influence, nor was it subject to political interference or control. This is also something that the committee can be proud of. The fact that the work has been intense and unremitting from beginning to end is even more important. Even when the violent Japanese were invading and the gunfire was continuous, and in the communist areas where there was a risk of attack, the staff were still able to carry out the relief work as usual, and it was not heard that it was suspended due to fear or difficulty. The staff of this committee proceeded with this spirit and continued unremittingly, so that they were able to build a dam of 5,000 kilometers in this short period of time (along the Yangtze River from Shashi to Guazhou below Zhenjiang, and along the Han River, Huai River, and Grand Canal where there is a risk of flooding). Most of this huge project was newly built, and the number of workers employed reached 1.4 million at its peak. From now on, even if the Yangtze River overflows, unless it exceeds the ordinary, it should not cause a major disaster again. All the staff of the committee (most of whom are unpaid) are admirable for their loyalty and integrity in handling affairs. Outstanding among them are Sir Simpson and General Zhu Qinglan. These two gentlemen are enthusiastic, fair, diligent day and night. The success of this committee is largely due to the efforts of these two gentlemen. Regarding the proposal made by the Standing Committee, I have a word to explain it. 90% of the work planned by this committee has been completed, and this huge organization is no longer needed. The unfinished projects have been planned, funds have been prepared, and they can be carried out step by step to completion. According to the above situation, the committee believes that the committee's affairs can now begin to be wound down so that the progress can be reported to the government as soon as possible. The permanent maintenance of the dike in the future should also be proposed to the government for selection and completion of the task.</p>
<p>Report on Disaster Area Work Next, the Disaster Area Work Group of the Flood Relief Committee reported on the progress since its establishment: (1) After the establishment of the association in August 20, it began relief efforts and requested Colonel and Mrs. Lindbergh of the United States to assist in measuring the disaster situation in Anhui and Jiangsu, and British naval aviation experts to assist in measuring the Hebei area, and produced a disaster area map of the Yangtze River and Huai River basin. (2) The process of contacting the United States to purchase US wheat on credit, as well as the exact number distributed to various disaster areas. (3) The establishment of the Industrial Relief Office, specially requesting the Yangtze River, Huai River, tributaries, and Grand Canal main dikes, as well as the river diversion projects into the sea in Jiangbei near the sea. (4) The exact number of voluntary relief funds distributed to various disaster areas. (5) The situation of accommodating more than 500,000 refugees during the worst disaster and the total number of porridge factories established. (6) The process of handling agricultural relief. (7) The situation of transporting American wheat, as well as the process of selling a part of the American wheat for cash. (8) Results of inspections and audits of accounts in various places. (9) The organization and diagnosis situation of the epidemic prevention office. (10) Detailed report on the association's financial revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p>Resolving to Conclude Various Cases After the Disaster Area Work Group completed its report, the committee members present successively expressed their opinions. Everyone had no objection to the conclusion of the committee, so they began to discuss the proposals. (1) Resolved that the committee will begin to conclude the various departments and agencies from July 1st of this year, but unfinished work will continue. (2) Resolved that all work that should continue will be wound up successively after completion. (3) Resolved that the chairman will select several members of the committee to form a concluding committee to handle all affairs. Zeng Rongfu, Wei Wenbin, Baker, Xi Dejiong, Zha Liangzhao, Anders, and other six people were appointed as concluding committee members to be responsible for presiding over the concluding affairs of the association.</p>
<p>Carrying out Unfinished Matters Although the association has decided to begin to conclude from July 1st of this year, all unfinished projects should still be carried out according to the original plan. Currently, the work that the association has not yet completed is the completion of the embankment, as well as the inspection and maintenance of the summer embankment, the sorting and auditing of accounts. Due to the scale of the project and the complexity of the accounts, it will take at least three or four months to complete all of them. However, the handling of the concluding matters should be jointly handled by the concluding committee and the accounting and auditing personnel. It is hoped that the accounting books can be cleared by the end of October or early November, and the auditors will prove that there are no errors. At that time, all the tasks of the association can be completely completed.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Workers of the Ordnance Factory Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>And also went to the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters Again Today</p>
<p>The plan to shut down the Shanghai Ordnance Factory, after the factory sent representatives to Nanjing to request a resumption of work, has now been temporarily suspended. However, the future of the shutdown is still pending. The Ministry of Military Administration has not yet made a decision and must wait for a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek before there can be a clear expression. On the workers' side, at 10 AM yesterday morning, representatives Mei Jixin, Yuan Genquan, Chen Yaohua, Zhang Houfu, Lu Shengquan, Chen Changzhou, Sun Songming, Ji Zhiping, and other eight people were dispatched to the Municipal Government to petition first. They went to see Mayor Wu Tiecheng. Because Wu was very busy meeting guests, he sent staff member Wang to receive them on his behalf. The workers informed Wang about the purpose of the petition and presented a petition document. The document contained four points explaining the reasons for requesting a resumption of work: (1) Many of the provisions of the Bromley's recommendations are not appropriate. (2) Many of the Shanghai factory's machinery parts have rusted severely while abroad. If there is a delay, they will become waste. (3) The Shanghai factory is a shield for the southeastern half of the country and has repeatedly made miraculous achievements. It should not be shut down, which would affect national defense. (4) The workers of the Shanghai factory manufactured weapons for the 19th Route Army during the anti-Japanese war, which had an indirect effect. Their livelihoods should be maintained and the factory should not be shut down. The eight representatives requested that Wang relay this intention to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission. Wang promised to ask Mayor Wu to fulfill this request. Later, the representatives went to the Garrison Headquarters to see Commander Dai. Because Dai was not there, Adjutant Zheng Youshang met with them on his behalf. He expressed his deep sympathy for the representatives' requests and promised to relay them to Commander Dai and send a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to continue handling the matter. The workers' representatives then withdrew and planned to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters again this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Withdrawal of Japanese Troops from Zone D is Indefinite <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Promises a Definite Reply Today</p>
<p>Otherwise, Our Side Will Submit it to the Joint Committee</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese troops stationed temporarily in Zone D, Toyota Textile Factory, Gongda Textile Factory, and Huafeng Textile Factory, our side's committee members of the Joint Committee, Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing, have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side. The Japanese side has agreed to withdraw them as soon as possible, but has not yet fulfilled this promise. Committee member Yu Hongjun especially inquired about the Japanese committee member Okazaki on the phone at 9 AM yesterday morning. Okazaki replied to Yu on the phone at 11 AM, stating that the Japanese troops stationed at the Tongwen Academy had completely withdrawn the day before. The Japanese troops stationed at the Toyota, Gongda, and Huafeng textile factories will also withdraw one after another. As for the Japanese troops stationed in Zone D temporarily, they have repeatedly urged the Marine Corps authorities to withdraw as soon as possible. However, the withdrawal date must wait until tomorrow (i.e., today) before a reply can be given. According to Committee member Yu Hongjun, if a satisfactory reply from the Japanese side is not received before noon tomorrow (i.e., today), our side will submit it to the Joint Committee for negotiation in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Nisshin's Tangshan Maru Crashed into Chinese Ship Haiping <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Crashed into 裏 Tongsha</p>
<p>Returned to Shanghai for Repairs Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yingkou liner Haiping of the Shanghai Haichang Company was sailing from Shanghai to Niuzhuang when it was hit by the North Ocean liner Tangshan Maru of the Nisshin Company outside the Wusong estuary near the 裏 Tongsha lightship (about 60 nautical miles from Shanghai), causing considerable damage. The responsibility for the accident lies entirely with the Japanese ship. The reporter has investigated the details of the incident and recorded them as follows:</p>
<p>The Truth of the Accident The Haiping was loaded with cargo and passengers in Shanghai and set off for Yingkou at 4 PM on the 25th. At 8:28 PM that night, when it approached the 裏 Tongsha lightship, the Haiping's navigator was steering southeast by two and a half points south, following the navigation ship. Suddenly, a ship came from the opposite direction, first seeing a green light. At 8:30 PM, another ship was seen, showing a red light. The Haiping then changed course to southeast east by one-quarter east S·EIE1/4E. The ship showing the green light sounded its whistle once. The ships showing the red light followed one after another, heading forward. In order to avoid the accident, the Haiping steered towards the side of the Jiuduan lightship and sounded its whistle twice. At that time, one ship had already passed, and the ship showing the red light was the Tangshan Maru of the Nisshin Company, which was traveling from Tianjin to Shanghai via Qingdao. At this time, it also answered twice, indicating that it was passing on the right side. The Haiping then made way to the left. At 8:40 PM, the Tangshan Maru showed a red light. Unexpectedly, one minute later, the Tangshan Maru showed both red and green lights, indicating that its hull was heading towards the Haiping. At this time, the left side of the Haiping was close to the lightship, and there was no room to make way. In an instant, the bow of the Tangshan Maru crashed into the starboard side of the Haiping.</p>
<p>Damage The Haiping had no way to retreat at that time, but the bow of the Tangshan Maru did not deviate to the right but turned to the left, resulting in the collision. The starboard side of the third cargo hold of the Haiping was hit hard by the bow of the Tangshan Maru, and the iron plates were completely destroyed, creating a large hole. Fortunately, the place that was hit was still above the waterline, so although the seawater rushed in violently, it did not immediately sink. If it had been damaged below the waterline, it would have sunk to the bottom of the sea long ago. There was a lot of cargo in the third hold, which was all soaked by the water that rushed in, causing considerable damage. The bow of the Tangshan Maru was also damaged. After causing the accident, the ship ignored everything and sailed to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Grounding Itself After the Haiping was hit, it was deeply afraid that the heavy load and water intake would be unsustainable, or that an accident would occur. Therefore, within 20 minutes of being hit, the shipowner himself drove the Haiping to the shallow beach near the lightship to run aground to avoid accidents and to show seriousness. The shipowner tried to pump out some of the accumulated water from the third hold and reported to Shanghai that the damage was too severe to travel long distances. It was not until yesterday morning that the Haiping was driven out of the shallows at high tide and returned to Shanghai to carry out inspections and repairs and negotiate with the Japanese merchants.</p>
<p>Returned to Shanghai for Repairs The Haiping returned to Shanghai from the 裏 Tongsha Jiuduan lightship yesterday and was docked at the 25th and 26th river cylinders inside the Yongkou. The shipowner reported to the company and the customs, and first sent personnel to the ship to inspect the damaged areas and planned to unload the cargo from the third hold, and then repair the hole. Passengers on board had to go ashore and take other ships. They negotiated with Nisshin on the other hand. The amount of loss has not yet been determined, but the damage to both ships and cargo is considerable. The ship is 2,360 tons and was built in 1897.</p>

<p>The British merchant ship that came to Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday (Saturday) loaded a large batch of military supplies for transshipment to Guangdong, including 200 boxes of bullets, 24 machine guns, and 14 wireless radios. The military supplies were shipped to Guangdong and received by the Eighth Route Army Headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Hongkou Silk Factories Completely Shut Down Yesterday <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Sent Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate and Mediate</p>
<p>The Guild Will Hold a Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>Following the strike by workers at the Yichang and other silk factories in Hongkou, the situation has become serious, and the strike is spreading. Of the ten single-reeling silk factories that were operating, eight have joined the strike, and two have voluntarily announced a shutdown. Party and government agencies dispatched personnel yesterday to seek mediation. The trade association is scheduled to hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss solutions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strike Increases: Following the strike by workers at Yichang Silk Factory, workers at five other factories, including Xiangcheng, Yuncheng, Tongwei, Yujing, and Xinlun, were also dissuaded from working and joined the strike. The night before last, all workers at the 208 silk reeling machines at Houfu Silk Factory on Zhangjiaxiang Road and the 208 silk reeling machines at Weiyu Silk Factory also joined the strike. As of yesterday morning, a total of eight factories, with more than 5,000 male and female workers, had joined the strike. The factory authorities automatically suspended operations at 352 silk reeling machines at Renji Silk Factory on Tiantong Road and 312 silk reeling machines at Tongyi Silk Factory on Zhangjiaxiang Road. As a result, the single-reeling silk factories in the Hongkou district are completely shut down. Only the 224 silk reeling machines at the Fulunheng double-reeling factory are unaffected because they have no connection with the single-reeling factories.</p>
<p>Guild's Response: At 8:00 AM yesterday, all directors of the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union held an informal meeting to discuss solutions. They originally planned to send Chen Xiufu, Le Xiaorong, and others to negotiate with Shen, the chairman of the trade association. However, after receiving the guild's response, they stopped their trip. The original letter is recorded below: To the respondents, regarding your letters of the 22nd and 24th of this month, and the statements made by your representatives, we have understood everything. We are now sending letters to all silk factories to pay close attention to working hours and careful production. As for the issue of wages, we will convene a meeting of the industry next week to discuss and decide, and then inform you. We are writing to inform you in advance. Please take note. Sincerely, Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union.</p>
<p>Party and Government Investigation: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, considering that the silk factory workers' strike concerns local security, specially dispatched Zhu Guilin, together with Zhou Lianze of the Municipal Party Headquarters, at 1:00 PM yesterday to thoroughly investigate the strike with both labor and management, in order to mediate and avoid the expansion of the labor unrest. At the same time, Wu Tingxun, the chief of the Fifth District Third Sub-Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was ordered to dispatch armed police officers to station in various silk factories within the district to provide protection and strictly prevent thugs from infiltrating and inciting labor unrest. The strike situation has already been reported to the General Bureau for review and handling.</p>
<p>Management Meeting: The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association is scheduled to convene a general meeting of all members on the 29th of this month (i.e., tomorrow, Wednesday) to discuss the labor unrest issue.</p>
<p>Sixth District Requests: Of the silk factories operating in the Zhabei district, there are a total of 14, including Ruifengyu, Gongji, Lunchang, and Yuanfeng. The Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Union, believing that the wage issue concerns all silk factories in the city and fearing its spread and the occurrence of unfortunate events, yesterday morning separately advised workers at each factory to wait patiently for party and government agencies to mediate according to the law and not to act without authorization. Fortunately, all workers deeply understood the greater good and decided to wait patiently for the union to negotiate. At 2:00 PM, they sent representatives Wu Suzhen, Yang Gengdi, and others to negotiate with the trade association. Chairman Shen promised to provide a satisfactory response after the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Brewing Labor Unrest in the National Pharmaceutical Industry <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>A Strike is About to Happen.</p>
<p>The situation between labor and management in the local national pharmaceutical industry is worsening. At a time when the epidemic is spreading, a strike would hit patients the hardest. It is hoped that both sides can show mutual concession and seek a reasonable solution. This would be a blessing for society and not just for the industry itself. The details are summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e164">News from the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The labor unrest in the local national pharmaceutical industry is becoming more serious as employers refuse workers' demands, and a strike is likely to occur. The local party and government agencies have reached an agreement on how to handle the situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Workers' Meeting: Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the wage increase campaign committee held its first meeting. Chairman Feng Xingkang resolved the following matters: (1) The resolution of the executive meeting of the wage increase campaign committee was discussed and passed. (2) The wage increase campaign committee should elect a five-member chairman group. Zhao Zhenhui, Fang Qingjian, Yuan Pinzhang, Chen Yuantao, and Feng Xingkang were elected. (3) Future declarations and interviews with reporters should be based on the resolution. The resolution was passed. (4) The committee should contact the trade association about the wage increase issue. Should a date and number of people be determined? It was resolved that the number of people would be seven. In addition to the original chairman group, Zhu Xiaqing and Fang Qinghe were elected as representatives. The date was set for 1:00 PM on the 28th, gathering at the second district branch. (5) A notice to all district branches to strengthen grassroots work was passed. (6) The resignation requests of comrades Zhao Zhenhui and Han Bingyao were discussed. It was resolved to unanimously retain them.</p>
<p>Document to the Party Headquarters: A document was submitted stating that the National Pharmaceutical Trade Association is instructing its members to undermine labor-management conditions separately, requesting instructions to stop this in order to eliminate disputes and benefit the labor movement. The union held a general meeting of all employee representatives on the afternoon of the 24th of this month, and it was reported that representatives had been sent to guide the meeting. Now, the resolutions and requirements are recorded and submitted to the committee: (1) The employers of Qintongde, Fengcunren, Yetian de, and other three stores have violated the conditions and refused to hire substitutes. (2) The employer of Wangyuandao hires non-union members, causing increased unemployment and extending working hours. (3) Shouquanzhai and Hongji and other stores oppress employees and extend working hours. (4) Recently, the trade association used coercive methods to deceive employees in the outer sections to join the association, dividing the union's organization. The outer sections' employees unanimously swore to oppose this. It is humbly requested that the National Pharmaceutical Trade Association be instructed to accept and implement these measures to eliminate disputes and benefit the labor movement. This would be a great favor. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Refuting the Employers: The Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, in response to the report in the newspaper about Zhang Meian of the Pharmaceutical Trade Association's statement on the dispute, stated that many of the points were untrue. Yesterday, they specially wrote a rebuttal as follows: (1) Regarding the labor-management contract, Mr. Zhang believes it was illegally privately signed. It should be known that the labor-management contract was signed by the five parties of the government, military, and labor following legal procedures. How can it be said to be illegal? Moreover, the contract is permanently valid, and neither party can violate it. Now, employers such as Caitongde and Fengcunren have refused to hire substitutes, while Wangyuandao and other stores have hired non-members without authorization, and Shouquanzhai and other stores have extended working hours, which is obviously a deliberate breach of contract. (2) The issue of outer-section employees. The nature of pharmaceutical work is different from other industries. Ordinary pharmacies are both internal and external, and most can be considered technical. Therefore, employees must not only serve customers and sell goods but also perform other technical work. The major pharmacies in this city have had to divide into inner and outer sections due to the development of their business. In fact, both inner and outer sections are workers and are equal. As for the interpretation of the former Central Training Department and the Ministry of Industry, it is feared that they did not understand the actual situation of the pharmaceutical industry at that time or were deceived by the employers. (3) Legal issues. Since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, after the cancellation of employee organizations, the central government and the local party and government agencies have announced that the original labor-management contracts remain valid. The union's maintenance of the original contract is a legitimate action in compliance with the law. (4) The issue of employees joining the trade association. The employers consider outer-section employees to be clerks and force them to join the trade association. It should be known that even if employees are considered clerks, they have the freedom to join the trade association. How can they be forced? Moreover, it is questionable whether joining is beneficial to employees. (5) The issue of dispatching substitutes. The right to dispatch substitutes is in the hands of the labor party, as clearly stipulated in the contract. The employers cannot refuse it. (6) The issue of wage increases. The wage rate of employees in this industry is extremely low. Although there have been several negotiations for wage increases, the monthly salary of each person is still only 16 yuan. In this period of high living costs, this meager salary is not enough to make ends meet. Moreover, the employers have repeatedly increased retail prices. After the Shanghai war, business has been better than before. Therefore, workers' demand for wage increases is justified. (7) The issue of placing the unemployed. The number of people in the pharmaceutical industry increases every year due to the apprenticeship system. As a result, many are unemployed. It is necessary to find ways to place them, which would affect their livelihoods. However, the employers do not care and refuse to hire unemployed members as substitutes, and even dismiss working employees. Their intentions are obvious.</p>
<p>The Authorities' Handling: A reporter from the Dagong newspaper visited Xu Shifu, the chief of the third section of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday to inquire about the authorities' handling of the labor unrest. He replied that the bureau had sent staff to attend and guide the meeting when the union convened a meeting of members the other day. According to the staff's report, the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense, and a strike was feared. The bureau believes that if the pharmaceutical industry goes on strike during this summer season of epidemic prevention, it will have a major impact on the lives of patients and the public health of society. Therefore, it attaches great importance to this issue. However, the labor unrest arose from the employer's breach of the labor-management contract signed in 1927. The crux of the matter lies in whether the contract remains valid due to changes in laws and regulations. Once this issue is resolved, other issues can be easily solved. Therefore, the bureau has sent a letter to the municipal party headquarters to handle the matter properly and has scheduled a meeting to discuss handling the situation. It has also ordered both sides of the industry to submit the agreed conditions to the bureau for review in order to study them and has ordered the labor side to wait patiently for a resolution and not to take immediate action, in order to eliminate the dispute invisibly and protect public safety.</p>
<h3 id="e165">News from the Trade Association <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The National Pharmaceutical Trade Association convened an emergency executive committee meeting yesterday to discuss how to deal with the labor unrest. In addition to all the executive committee members, more than 200 trade members attended and participated. Zhuang Meitang was elected chairman, and it was resolved to reject the union's demands and issue a declaration to the public. At the same time, several representatives were sent to the competent authorities to petition and stop the union's overstepping actions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Key Resolutions: (1) On the issue of demarcating the boundaries between inner and outer section employees in this industry, the association is executing orders and it is difficult to change according to the law. Therefore, the association will not interfere with the union's opposition to the demarcation. (2) The association is following the Social Affairs Bureau's instructions in refusing substitutes from the outer sections. All unemployed clerks should register with the association. The association will introduce them to various stores as substitutes at any time. It is difficult to accept the union's unauthorized appointment. (3) The association firmly opposes the union's demand for a wage increase of 10 yuan per person per month. (4) Cen Zhiliang, Zhang Meian, Zhou Qiansheng, and Feng Jinpu were elected as representatives to petition various authorities for relief. (5) A declaration will be issued to the public. (6) A general meeting of members will be convened in advance in order to deal with the situation uniformly. (7) Pharmaceutical employees are advised not to be used and endanger society. All members are notified to deal with the environment with a calm and composed spirit. (8) If necessary, the association will set up temporary pharmacies in various places together with the medical community to facilitate patients' purchase of medicine.</p>
<p>Declaration:</p>
<p>We, the pharmaceutical employers, have long been the meat on the chopping block of the drug workers, and are now about to suffer the unjust accusations and oppression of a workers' strike. The reasons the pharmaceutical workers are using to justify their strike this time are: first, that the employers have violated the labor-management conditions; second, that they are upholding the substitute worker system; and third, that they are demanding wage increases. But the revision of the labor-management conditions in our industry is an order from the central government; the improvement of the substitute worker system is an instruction from the Social Affairs Bureau; what fault is it of us employers? As for increasing wages, we employers have already increased them again and again, making them the highest in the national pharmaceutical industry. At a time when the great war has just ended and the social economy is bankrupt, the employers are seeking life but cannot, seeking death but cannot, and the affectionate workers want to demand wage increases at this time; are they not harboring ulterior motives? Among the pharmaceutical workers in the city, there must be many who are aware of the current situation; they should know that today's government and laws are all complete and clear, not like the lawless and reckless bandits who roamed Shanghai during the 16th year of the Republic. All citizens of our country have the obligation to abide by the law. If the pharmaceutical workers still know the meaning of the word "national law," then all their actions should be based on the law. If they rely on the crowd, coerce, and hope to gain an advantage by chance, I fear they will inevitably be subject to legal sanctions. Moreover, the current society is not one where one hand can cover the sky and deceive oneself. Even if we employers can be coerced and subdued by the workers, the people of society all have (eyes), and public opinion is inescapable. Speaking of the present, the treatment and living conditions of pharmaceutical workers in Shanghai, although not as good as those of the general public, are not subject to management and have the freedom to enter and exit, which is still better than them. The cause of this labor unrest is due to a few troublemakers in the union who are using it to seek personal gain, not hesitating to stir up trouble and spread rumors to create a terrifying situation. Their conspiracies and schemes are deeply rooted. How can the pharmaceutical workers of the city be willing to be used and not know to return? The only ones who are indirectly harmed are the patients in society. Therefore, those in society who have the ability to judge and adjudicate should not ignore this pharmaceutical labor unrest and should quickly rise up and make righteous claims, so that the unfortunate situation can be eliminated invisibly. We employers will abide by the law until death, and we hope for your wise consideration.</p>
<p>Orders from the Ministry and Approvals from the Bureau:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued Order No. 290:</p>
<p>It is hereby ordered that the facts are known. According to the letter No. 17513 from the Central Training Department, "According to the report submitted by your committee's former People's Training Committee on the service situation of the workers in the duck and pharmaceutical industries, please review," it has been received by the Ministry. While it is under review, a letter from the Ministry of Industry also stated, "The personnel working in the pill and powder and decoction departments of the pharmaceutical industry also take care of both inner and outer court work. It should be determined based on their main work. If the personnel in the two departments also take care of the outer court work, then they should join the trade union. If they also take care of the inner court work after the outer court work, then they should join the trade association," etc. After checking, the nature of the service of the employers in the duck industry is roughly the same as the personnel in the pill and powder and decoction departments of the pharmaceutical industry who also take care of the inner and outer court work. Their organizations can refer to the above explanation and join the trade union or trade association separately. As requested in the previous report, it is hereby replied to you. In addition to issuing separate orders, it is hereby informed. This order.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Order No. 1911:</p>
<p>Received the report. After checking, clerks cannot join the trade union according to law, and the trade union cannot overstep its authority to dispatch. From now on, when there are unemployed clerks, they should register with the trade association so that they can be introduced, which is in accordance with laws and regulations. In addition to approving the instructions to the trade union to proceed accordingly, it is hereby notified. This approval.</p>
<p>Document to the Municipal Government:</p>
<p>The document is submitted stating that pharmaceutical workers are illegally coercing and brewing a strike. Please strictly stop them to protect the people's health. This association has been reading in the newspapers for days that the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Trade Union convened a meeting of members' representatives regarding cases where the employers refused to hire substitutes, demarcated the boundaries between inner and outer section clerks, and demanded a wage increase of 10 yuan per person per month, and resolved to prepare for a strike to deal with it, etc. Reading it, I am extremely horrified. After checking, the association is acting in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of Industry and the Central Training Department to demarcate the boundaries between inner and outer section clerks in the pharmaceutical industry. The association is following the instructions of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to refuse the trade union's unauthorized dispatch of substitutes in the outer section. As for the request for a wage increase, this association cannot accept it at a time when the great war has just ended and commerce is declining. However, the trade union is disregarding the people's health and planning a strike to coerce, which is extremely illegal. It is reasonable to prepare a document and submit it to the municipal government, humbly requesting that the government strictly order them to stop it, in order to prevent disputes and maintain the people's health. This would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Taxpayers Association Asks the Municipal Council Not to Collect Extra-Settlement House Taxes <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession yesterday sent a letter to the General Office of the Municipal Council, saying:</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>According to the letter from Dai Chunlin of Caojiadu on June 24, during the Shanghai war, he rented a house at No. 14 Sanyi Lane, by the extra-settlement road on Jessfield Road. He has already moved out for four months. At first, a Chinese tax collector from the Public Concession, speaking with a Suzhou accent, went to collect 18 taels of silver for the spring tax for Sanyi Lane. Because the area belongs to the Chinese territory and is not equipped with concession electric lights or telephones, he politely refused. At the end of April, the council sent a notice of spring tax due for Sanyi Lane, totaling 12 taels of silver, and a notice of summer tax due, totaling 18 taels of silver. This morning (June 24), the tax collector came again to collect the tax and said that he had to pay the summer tax together with the two seasons' taxes for Sanyi Lane, otherwise he would add the tax. After a while, he borrowed a Westerner to come, and he answered with the same words. The Westerner, through an interpreter, said that if it was not paid this morning, he would come in the afternoon to cut the electric light wires and seal the door.</p>
<p>According to the letter from Renfengzhai on June 24, during the Shanghai war, several friends sought refuge, and a small number of people temporarily borrowed a house at No. 11 Sanyi Lane, near the extra-settlement road on Jessfield Road. Around early April, the Chinese tax collector of the Municipal Council came to the small store and wanted to collect 18 taels of silver for the spring tax for Sanyi Lane. He replied that the place was beside the extra-settlement road and was not equipped with concession telephones or electric lights, so he should not pay. He also said that the place had already been moved out. The tax collector said that it could be changed to 12 taels of silver. At the end of April, the tax office sent two notices, one for the spring tax of 12 taels and the other for the summer tax of 18 taels. This morning, the Chinese came to the small store to collect the summer tax, and they paid the full amount of tax they should pay. After a while, the tax collector who wanted to collect the tax for Sanyi Lane came with a Westerner and wanted to collect 12 taels of silver for the spring tax for No. 11 Sanyi Lane. He replied as before.</p>
<p>It is beyond doubt that the house tax beside the extra-settlement road should be collected by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Moreover, it should not cause further complications or misunderstandings while the problem is being resolved. According to the letter above, we request that your council, according to law, prevent the tax collectors' extra-legal actions.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association</p>

<p>Hengda New Kee Yarn Factory in Yangsi Bridge, Pudong, is a large-scale factory. Manager Chen Zisheng has been carefully planning, so the business has been booming in recent years. It is quite developed. It has a 500-kilowatt steam turbine generator to supply the factory's electricity needs. However, it consumes a lot of coal and is very uneconomical. It often needs to be shut down for repairs, which hinders work and causes huge hidden losses. It has now reached a satisfactory agreement with the Pudong Electric Company to switch to electricity supplied by the company. It is said that the contracted electricity price is quite low, which can save a lot of expenses every month. Moreover, the company has a sufficient amount of electricity, which can be expanded at any time, and the continuous supply throughout the year will prevent work from being interrupted, which is especially convenient.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Sniping of a Beautiful Young Woman <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Shot Five Times, Life in Critical Danger</p>
<p>The Reason for the Attack is Difficult to Guess</p>
<p>At 10:35 last night, a young woman on the third floor of Dechang Foreign Goods Store, No. 118, Former New Street, near the Grand Clock Tower in the French Concession, was suddenly assassinated by a gunman. She was shot five times all over her body and her life is in critical danger. The murderer escaped from the scene. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Beautiful Young Woman: Song Jinfeng, a woman from Pudong, is 26 years old, slender and beautiful. A year ago, she became acquainted with Zhou Yongkang (nicknamed "Little Baldy"), a well-known gangster, and rented a house together at No. 118, Former New Street, Maidian Road, French Concession, on the fourth floor of Dechang Foreign Goods Cloth Store, the back door is No. 31, Mingde Lane.</p>
<p>Smoking Opium: Little Baldy Zhou Yongkang usually makes a living by gambling. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, he has been in financial straits. He leaves early and returns late every day, borrowing money to make a living. At about 10:30 last night, Zhou was not yet home, and Jinfeng went to the Yanzi Nest opened by a local old woman on the third floor to smoke opium for fun. Before she could go to bed, a violent guest suddenly arrived.</p>
<p>Five Shots Sniped: Jinfeng had just entered the old woman's room and was sitting on a round stool chatting, waiting for another person to finish smoking. Before she could say a few words, two people wearing blue short outfits suddenly rushed up from downstairs. One person leaned against the side of the door, poked his head inside, and the other person took out a pistol and aimed five shots at Jinfeng. The bullets pierced through her like a string of pearls.</p>
<p>Falling in Response: At the sound of the gunshots, Jinfeng fell in response. Everyone in the room was pale and frozen like wooden chickens. The murderer took the opportunity to escape. The old woman immediately ran to the Grand Clock Tower police station to report. The head of the police immediately sent detectives to investigate. They found that Jinfeng had been shot five times all over her body, including two shots in the chest, one shot in each of her left and right hands, and one shot in the abdomen.</p>
<p>Life in Critical Danger: After the police finished investigating, they immediately transported Jinfeng to Renji Hospital. Due to excessive blood loss, she was unconscious upon arrival at the hospital. Her life is in critical danger. Soon after, Zhou Yongkang heard the news and rushed to the scene. He immediately reported to Song Guisheng, Jinfeng's father, who runs a Tiger Dumpling Stove on Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road. According to the speculation of the general public, Song's encounter with violence may contain an affair, or it may be Little Baldy's enemies who came to assassinate Little Baldy. Because he was not at home, Jinfeng was mistakenly targeted.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Zhao Xilin Assassinated, Concubine and Disciple Suspected <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Zhao's Concubine Narrates the Shooting</p>
<p>Zhao's Disciple Denies "Old Man"</p>
<p>Zhao Xilin, from Changzhou, formerly worked as a detective in the Public Security Bureau in his hometown. After resigning, he came to Shanghai and resided at No. 24 Ande Lane, Yangshupu Road, working as an inspector at the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill. On the evening of the 13th of this month, at 10:05 PM, he went out with his concubine, Ms. Jiang, a woman from Nanjing. While passing near Wanxingfang in Yangshupu, he was shot by an enemy, injuring a vital area. Chinese and Western detectives arrived and transported him to Tongren Hospital. He succumbed to his injuries the following day around 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>He Died of Serious Injuries. The special court's interrogation has already been reported. The other day, Shen Yuzhou, a Chinese detective of the Yangshupu Police Station, learned that Xu A'er, a Wuxi native residing at No. 28 Liuchunfang, Yangshupu Road, was privately hiding firearms and was highly suspected in the Zhao case. He then went with Western detectives to search for firearms but found nothing. According to Xu's confession, he had a Mauser pistol hidden in the home of his uncle, Xu Buyue, in a bungalow without a number on Meizhou Road. The detectives went to the house again and found No. 8371</p>
<p>Mauser Pistol, one piece, and one cartridge case in a basket under the bed. However, Xu Buyue had already fled after hearing the news. The detectives then went to Ande Lane and arrested Zhao's concubine, Ms. Jiang. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court's First Tribunal. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, first stated the case, saying that the defendants were highly suspected in the Zhao Xilin shooting case. The defendant, Zhao's concubine Ms. Jiang, was Zhao Xilin's fourth concubine and was found to have</p>
<p>Illicit Relations with Xu A'er. After Zhao's death, she had a self-defense pistol without a Bureau of Public Works license. Zhao's concubine Ms. Jiang gave it to Xu A'er to hide at his uncle Xu Buyue's house on Meizhou Road, and it has been seized. The police found another pistol, which was taken away by Liu Shunnian, a detective from the Changzhou Public Security Bureau, the day after the incident. Because at the scene of the Zhao Xilin shooting, police officers</p>
<p>Obtained Cartridge Cases, several pieces, the court was requested to send an official letter to the Changzhou County Public Security Bureau, ordering detective Liu Shunnian to bring the pistol he took to the next hearing for review. The seized Mauser pistol was then presented for inspection. Zhao's concubine Ms. Jiang testified that she was 33 years old and had been living with Zhao Xilin for four years. That evening, I went out with Xilin to the entrance of Wanxingfang on Yangshupu Road. Suddenly, I heard a gunshot, and I looked up at the sky, while Xilin looked down at the ground, but I didn't see anyone. A moment later, someone fired a shot from my shoulder, and Xilin was</p>
<p>Hit in a Vital Area and fell to the ground. I turned around and saw two people running away. At that moment, a police car arrived and took me and Xilin to the police station. After a brief interrogation, the injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment, and I went home. The next day, Xilin died in the hospital due to his serious injuries. He had many enemies. Last year, Ning Haoming, the leader of a kidnapping gang from Changzhou, also shot at him, but fortunately, he was not hit. However, the shooter at that time</p>
<p>Was Not Aiming at Him. Xu A'er is Xilin's disciple and often comes to my house. There were indeed two pistols, neither of which had a license. One was taken away by Liu Shunnian, and the other, the one presented in court, was given to Xu A'er for safekeeping because it did not have a license and I was afraid it would be stolen, and so on. Xu A'er testified that he was 23 years old and Zhao Xilin had recommended him to work in a sock factory, so he called him "teacher," not "old man." When Xilin was shot, he visited him once in the hospital. He said that his injury was severe and painful, and he feared for his life. However, at the time of the shooting, I was listening to storytelling in Leyilou. I call Zhao's concubine "teacher's wife" and have no illicit relationship with her. Judge Shen Bingrong verified the testimony and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further verification at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Ye Shantao Cannot Shirk Responsibility as Director <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Second Branch of the High Court Pronounces Judgment Yesterday</p>
<p>Ye Sentenced to Imprisonment for Forgery</p>
<p>Zhou Songqing and Others Mutually Acknowledge Being Directors</p>
<p>Escrow Dispute Still Developing</p>
<p>Second Branch of the High Court's Judgment: After Huang Chu'jiu's death, the various businesses operated by his Gongfa Company, such as the Riyue Bank, the Dashijie Amusement Savings Department, and other financial institutions, successively collapsed, greatly affecting depositors. Because Gongfa was not a limited liability company, the shareholders and directors should bear unlimited liability. Therefore, the creditor groups pursued them. Ye Shantao, a wealthy businessman from Haiyan living in Shanghai, was also one of Gongfa's directors. When the creditors negotiated with him, he presented a letter signed by Huang Chu'jiu, stating that he had resigned as a director and had long disassociated himself from Gongfa. However, the creditors all believed that the letter was forged and jointly sued Ye for forgery. After the First Special District Local Court concluded its trial, it acquitted Ye Shantao on the grounds that the plaintiff's evidence was insufficient. After this setback, Zhang Zhengji and Zhu Chengfei expressed reluctance to continue the proceedings. Only Dong Longxing and Chen Kaifu's lawyer, Yan Luqing, still filed an appeal, requesting the reversal of the original judgment and further investigation. Hundreds of depositors of the Riyue Bank and the Amusement Savings Department recently sent a special letter to lawyer Yan, praising him for fighting for the interests of poor creditors. The Second Branch of the High Court also believed that the official case concerned the interests of the creditors and should not be hastily concluded. It held several hearings and conducted secret deliberations. Only yesterday afternoon did the Second Branch of the High Court's Criminal First Tribunal, presided over by Judge Yu, together with Judges Jiang and Zhao, specially convene a joint court to announce the judgment. The main text read: "The original judgment is reversed. Ye Shantao is sentenced to three months imprisonment with a two-year reprieve for forgery. The forged letter from Huang Chu'jiu is confiscated." However, Ye was not present when the judgment was announced, so it is still unknown whether he will accept the judgment.</p>
<p>Third Branch of the High Court Continues Trial: In the case of the collapse of the Shanghai Riyue Bank and the Dashijie Amusement Savings Department, the former French Concession court ruled that Zhao Qinbo, Zhou Songqing, and others should bear the responsibility of shareholders and directors of Gongfa Company, and dismissed the part concerning Ye Shantao. Subsequently, because the creditors were dissatisfied, they hired a lawyer to file an appeal in the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, requesting confirmation that Ye Shantao was a shareholder and director of Gongfa Company. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Lu Yimei, accompanied by Judges Zhao and Fan, opened the Civil First Tribunal for trial. First, lawyer Yan Luqing, representing more than 1,000 creditor households, stated that the main point of the appeal was to request confirmation that the appellee, Ye Shantao, was a shareholder and director of Gongfa Company. During the first trial, the appellee presented a written letter from Huang Chu'jiu, proving that Ye Shantao was not a director. The court based its judgment on this letter and ruled that he should not be held liable. Therefore, the appellants filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, and the first trial also acquitted Ye Shantao. Subsequently, the lawyers filed an appeal in the Second Branch of the High Court, and the judgment was announced at 1:00 PM today. The original judgment was reversed, and Ye Shantao was sentenced to three months imprisonment with a two-year reprieve for the crime of using forged documents. The forged letter from Huang Chu'jiu was confiscated. At that time, the appellee Ye Shantao was not present. His lawyer, Yu Zhongluo, stated that Ye was waiting for trial at the Third Branch of the High Court, so he was not present. However, he was still not seen in court during the trial, which shows that Ye Shantao's responsibility as a director of Gongfa Company is already beyond doubt. As for the shareholder part, it is said that it has been transferred to Ge Songxuan. Please summon Ge to the court for questioning, and it will be clear. The appellants believe that the appellee's shares have never been transferred to anyone and request the court to order the appellee to bear the responsibility of shareholder and director. Subsequently, lawyers Wang Shizong, Xu Yannian, Dong Yu, and Dong Chi, representing several thousand other creditor households, spoke successively, their reasons and wording being similar to those stated by lawyer Yan. The appellee, Ye Shantao, was represented by lawyer Lu Shaozong, who argued that the judgment of the Second Branch of the High Court had not yet been finalized because the appellee still had to file an appeal. Although the appellee was elected as a director of Gongfa Company in 1927, he never took office and had published a statement in the newspaper to that effect, and there was also a letter from Huang Chu'jiu as proof. As for the shareholder part, it had been transferred to Ge Songxuan in September 1930, and he could be summoned for questioning. The court was requested to maintain the original judgment. The successors of Zhou Songqing and Zhao Qinbo, Zhao Zengyu, Yan Wuzhi, and Yang Zhihao, represented by two lawyers, claimed that their clients were neither shareholders nor directors, and therefore they did not accept the judgment of the former French Concession court and requested an appeal to change the first trial's verdict. Lawyer Yan Luqing, representing the creditors, rose and refuted, stating that the appeal period for the claims of Zhou Songqing and the other two had passed, and the points they raised were fundamentally untenable and requested rejection. The court verified the statements and adjourned the hearing, scheduling a continuation for a later date.</p>

<p>Wang Jian Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Yan Yutang, the manager of the Dalong Iron Factory, Sulun Yarn Factory, and Guangyu Business Company, from Suzhou, was kidnapped by bandits on the morning of May 4th of this year at the entrance of No. 58 Jiangxi Road. Chief Inspector Lu Liankui, Inspector Liu Shaokui, Detective Feng Zhiming, Shen Tianbao, Wang Chengying, and Wu Hanzhang of the General Investigation Department of the General Police Station successively arrested five kidnapping bandits: Wang Jian, Kong A'liu, Chen Huiqing, Chen Xiaosi, and Yang Jingzhai. A large amount of firearms and ammunition were seized, and the hostage Yan Yutang was rescued. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court in accordance with the Law for the Punishment of Bandits. Kong A'liu and Chen Xiaosi hired lawyer Fan Gang for defense. The court's interrogation has been completed, and the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye specially opened the Criminal First Tribunal and announced the judgment. The main text read: "Chen Huiqing is sentenced to death for kidnapping and extortion, and is deprived of civil rights for life. Wang Jian is sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping and extortion, and is deprived of civil rights for life. Kong A'liu is sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment for kidnapping and extortion, and is deprived of civil rights for life. Chen Xiaosi and Yang Jingzhai are each sentenced to six years imprisonment for assisting in kidnapping and extortion." The number of days Kong A'liu, Chen Xiaosi, and Yang Jingzhai were detained before the final judgment will be counted as two days of imprisonment for one day. Three Mauser pistols, one automatic pistol, one gas pistol, 163 Mauser bullets, 15 bullet boxes, 31 automatic bullets, two bullet boxes, and two bottles of medicine (anesthetic) are all confiscated. After the judgment was announced, Judge Qian informed the defendants that, except for Chen Huiqing (who cannot appeal under special law for those sentenced to death), if the others, such as Kong A'liu, do not accept the judgment, they can file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court within ten days of receiving the judgment.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Fan Zhilong Assumes Office as Director of the Jiangzhe District Fisheries Bureau Yesterday <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Fan Zhilong, the Director of the Jiangzhe District Fisheries Administration, assumed his post at the bureau, but due to the urgency of the situation, the inauguration ceremony was not held until yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the bureau. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Inauguration Ceremony: Present were He Bingxian, the representative of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the supervising official, Wen Yingxing, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, Tang Haian, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, He Hanlan, the Director of the Navigation Administration Bureau, He Zhuoxian, the Director of the Trademark Bureau, Wang Defa, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, and more than 200 representatives from various groups and guests. Under the supervision of the supervising official, Fan officially took office after swearing an oath. Subsequently, Wen Yingxing and Li Zhengwu delivered speeches. The ceremony concluded with a group photo and refreshments.</p>
<p>Supervising Official's Address: We all know that on this Earth, the area of the water world is larger and broader than the area of the land. Therefore, the products in the water are naturally very abundant. According to recent studies and surveys by biologists, there are more than 36,500 species of fish, 2,500 species of mammals, and more than 3,000 species of reptiles in the water. In addition, there are crustaceans, algae, and so on. Since there are so many types of aquatic products, the resources in the water are certainly considerable. Therefore, modern countries, in addition to developing the resources on land, have been paying attention to the water. Our eastern neighbor, Japan, with its ambitious goals, began to focus on the management of aquatic products decades ago, establishing fisheries schools, encouraging fishing, and improving the manufacture of fishing equipment. Now, Japan has become a superior aquatic product country. Speaking of our China, for thousands of years, the government and the people have not known how to strive for the great benefits of the water. The fishing methods are still old-fashioned, the fishing gear has not been improved, and the fishermen along the coast are oppressed by pirates on the one hand and invaded by foreign fishing boats on the other, so that the fishing industry has become a dying state. With the length of our country's coastline and the abundance of aquatic products, it is a pity to abandon the aquatic product industry. According to recent surveys, our country still has to import aquatic products from foreign countries (i.e., Japan, etc.) worth 140 million yuan every year. We have God-given aquatic products but do not know how to fish or use them, and instead, the rights and interests overflow to foreign countries. The loss to the national economy and the people's livelihood and foreign trade is so great that it is truly heartbreaking. The ancients said, "Goods are hated for being abandoned on the ground." Now we can say, "Goods are hated for being abandoned in the water." The National Government, in view of this, has specially divided our country's coastal areas into four fishing zones, each with a fisheries administration bureau, which is responsible for protecting fishermen and patrolling for sea bandits. Now the Jiangzhe District Fisheries Administration Bureau has been established, and today is also the day that Director Fan is sworn into office. Director Fan has expertise, and I believe that if Director Fan can implement the Ministry's fisheries administration plan and strive to protect fishermen, the aquatic product industry along the Jiangzhe coast will gradually develop, and the rights and interests will not overflow to foreign countries. This is what I personally wish for and what the government expects.</p>
<p>Director's Reply: Today, I am taking office, and I am very honored to have you all come to guide me. Originally, the fisheries industry occupies an important position in the industry. Even the founding strategy of the late President Sun Yat-sen paid great attention to this point. This time, I was ordered to manage the fisheries, and I will do it practically in accordance with the teachings of the President. Just now, Supervising Official He made instructions on behalf of the government, and I will sincerely accept and sincerely abide by them. As for the construction plan of fisheries that all comrades and gentlemen have instructed, I will also fully adopt them. However, my knowledge is limited. In the future, I still hope that Supervising Official He and all comrades will supervise and guide me at any time, and that would be very grateful.</p>

<p>Lend as Much as Possible to Revitalize Various Industries in Disaster Areas</p>
<p>Letter Instructs Members to Implement Original Intentions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Disaster Area Industry and Commerce Reconstruction Committee received a reply from the Money Trade Association yesterday, stating, "In response to your letter requesting that we inform our members to lend as much credit as possible to rescue the industrial and commercial enterprises in the disaster areas within a possible range, we hereby reply that our members are all financial enterprises and have always adhered to the principle of assisting various industries in regulating surpluses and deficits. For example, during the January 28th Incident, when the city was suddenly hit by disaster, all industries were suspended, and the situation was extremely dangerous, our members, in order to save the city, did not avoid difficulties in this extremely critical situation and were the first to open for business, lending as much as possible within a possible range to maintain various industries. This difficult situation must be known to you all. Now, in accordance with your previous letter, we will again instruct our members to implement their original intentions to meet your wishes. However, the funds released by the financial industry all depend on the funds received to replenish them. If various industries rely solely on the financial industry's lending, it may not be a fundamental solution. You all have great insights and must have good methods to improve the situation."</p>
<h3 id="e174">Feng Bingnan's Letter to Four Organizations <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Expresses Opposition to the Great Alliance Against Civil War</p>
<p>To the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Banking Association, and the Money Trade Association:</p>
<p>I have heard that your colleagues have initiated a Great Alliance Against Civil War, hoping to eliminate internal strife and jointly resist foreign aggression. Within a month, it has resonated far and wide. How magnificent is this act, how grand is this wish! I have long admired it and am filled with praise. However, the most worrisome thing about the situation in the world is that it has become fixed. Once the situation has been formed, it is not easy to change. When it has already become chaotic, it cannot be stopped suddenly. Civil war is a chaotic phenomenon. When it occurs, it must have a source. If the source is not blocked, it is unlikely that its boiling can be stopped. Now, where is the source of civil war? Although it is called "politics for all people," the majority of people have no opportunity to participate in national affairs. The fundamental law is not established, the name and reality are inconsistent, and the gain and loss of power and position depend solely on force. Considering that the number of victories and defeats is uncertain, the distinction between obedience and disobedience is difficult to distinguish, and the world becomes private. When there is private interest, there is contention. The strong punish those who disagree, the next strongest observe the changes, and those who are not strong still think of seizing a share with a small force. This is one source. Revolution is a sudden change of progress, but the process is not always in a sudden change. Hanging it as a national policy and advocating it in learning leads to glorifying struggle. The ancients said that war is used only as a last resort, so stopping the halberd is a metaphor for military affairs, and stopping the shield is a metaphor for war. What is left for posterity is still a history of mutual slaughter. Moreover, being familiar with the propaganda of struggle and admiring the righteousness of revolution, people encourage each other, saying that it can lead to peace. Believing that the influence of the machine of nature is like a shadow following the form, the national defense army becomes a tool for personal struggle. Indulging in cruelty to the people, their courage is more than enough. Once they encounter foreign enemies, they avoid them as quickly as possible. The arrival of foreign insults often meets with internal strife. Therefore, possessing troops is not enough to defend the country, but is suitable for harming the people. This is the second source. Exploitation is used as a means of governance, and all industries are withered. Few can avoid the cold, and the lower-level people can hardly live their lives. They will not willingly sit and wait for death. The end of the Qin, Sui, Yuan, and Ming dynasties all led to their demise because of this. At that time, how could there be no people with deep knowledge and foresight who cried out loudly and tried to save the situation? However, the accumulated resentment was deep, and the unscrupulous people harbored hatred and anger to incite the people at that time. The environment at that time also drove them. Once the fire became fierce, it would not stop until it spread. This is the third source. These three sources are mutually causal. Is the disaster of civil war nearing its end? From this point of view, if the source can be blocked, there can be no war. Even if there is no anti-war, the war will stop by itself. This is the method of completely removing the firewood from under the cauldron. If this is not done, and we say "abolish war," it is like driving south while heading north. Then, should the movement to abolish war be stopped? That is not the case. As the saying goes, "To irrigate in the autumn of a great drought, the seedlings that wither later still have the merit of irrigation." Now, the great powers are surrounding us, and our neighbors are threatening us. Everyone has the humiliation of national subjugation, and everyone has the responsibility to save the country. Your association beats drums and strikes bells, awakening the deaf and enlightening the blind. Its words are strict, its righteousness is just, and its feelings are urgent and appropriate for the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. The people's spirit is manifested, and there is latent power. It depends on what the method is. If there is indeed a method to deal with this, to mend loopholes, it is as if it can be done. If its method is not incorporated into the principles, its effect will exceed what is possible. Therefore, I want to make three suggestions to your association: First, when advocating the abolition of war, we should first analyze the meaning of war and define its boundaries. The types of civil war are different. Some should be abolished, some cannot be abolished, and some cannot be allowed to be abolished. I have read Mozi's "Against Aggression" and discussed that seizing one thing and killing one person, everyone knows is unjust and criticizes it. Attacking a country harms others and benefits oneself, hinders farming and weaving, and its injustice is even greater. But they do not criticize it and instead praise it as righteous. It can be seen that the world is in chaos due to distinguishing righteousness. The words are very sad, and the "attacking a country" refers to those who invade others for profit. It should be criticized but is not criticized, which clearly shows a one-sided view, seeing the small but ignoring the big, and is actually cowardly in upholding justice. Therefore, unjust attacks are wars that should be abolished. Since then, scholars of international law have interpreted the meaning of war. Attacking and resisting each other constitutes war. Attacking without resistance, the fault lies with the aggressor. If there is no resistance, it can still be explained. Since the Charter of the League of Nations came out, it has been said that the right to protect rights can be defended by force. The arguments for self-defense are numerous, and the objective conditions are increasingly obscure. "No resistance" is a term that children know to be ridiculous. The war that is coming to attack, whether internal or external, cannot be abolished. If bandits suddenly attack and devastate cities, and communists incite and abuse, turning the land red, it is nothing but a delusion to talk about compromise. The war to suppress bandits cannot be abolished. Weigh their importance, examine their right and wrong, and then justice will exist. The Kellogg-Briand Pact's definition is unclear, and its meaning is too vague, which inevitably leads to different opinions. During its implementation, it requires too much explanation, resulting in the expected effect being invisible. The former Soviet Union's questioning of the United States is actually equal to a counter-attack. It is a lesson to be learned. Second, we should pay attention to the attitude of the military and assimilate them. For the past twenty years, internal strife has been endless, and it is almost impossible to avoid it every year. The general public has suffered terribly, and it is no wonder that they hate it deeply. Only the military is in a different situation, and it is not easy to get them to participate. However, recently, the commanders and officers have announced their rejection of civil war, which can be called an awakening. It is appropriate to take advantage of this opportunity to sincerely cooperate with them. Whether they are active-duty military officers or veterans, if they are willing to jointly initiate it, it should be adopted and the effect will be even greater. Those who are willing to be the leaders of the army should be condemned in writing and verbally, so that they have nowhere to hide. The purpose of eliminating the evil and promoting the good and subtly transforming them is what it means. Third, the alliance's solidarity should pay attention to organization. Among the gatherings of the majority of people, the most difficult thing is to be solid and lasting. The members are attached because of faith, not because of lifelong elegance. They follow because of righteousness, not because of the division between superiors and subordinates. What they have in common is the goal, and what is different is the meaning. The sages said that those who can adapt to the way cannot stand with it, and those who can stand with it cannot weigh it. To weigh with hundreds of millions of people is easy to involve in differences. If there are differences, they will be dissolved. If they are dissolved, there will be no power. If they want to be consistent in their steps and strict in their rules, it will not work without a perfect organization. The League of Nations' achievements are unsatisfactory, but its rules of deliberation and procedures for handling affairs are clearly seen in the charter, with clear outlines and detailed explanations. Its method of organization is meticulous. I do not know what the organization of your association is internally. Judging from the ten items you have put forward, it seems that it has not been perfected. If you say "no cooperation, no assistance," this is a very important declaration of sanctions. However, if the alliance itself does not have a meticulous organization, this kind of declaration is also a mere formality. It is necessary to pre-define the ways of holding meetings and so on. When specific facts occur, immediately create a plan, put it forward for discussion, analyze the reasons for the war, and evaluate the value of its use of troops. Only then can it be declared to the people of the country and extend its punishment and encouragement. If it does not undergo the above serious evaluation and makes vague remarks about sanctions, I ask, is it enough to break their hearts and weaken their morale? Ordinary lawsuits still have procedural laws to draw upon, let alone matters of public interest, where fairness is valued. If you act rashly, how can you achieve anything? Furthermore, in a country ruled by law, the general will of the people is expressed by the constitution. Therefore, the people of the whole country are moving within the orbit, and unjust wars have no chance to occur. The right to adjudicate does not belong to the free organizations. Now that the anti-war alliance has become a necessity of the times, it is clear evidence that public opinion is transformed into public power. Even if it is said that the highest authority of the state is manifested in this, it is not impossible. It is necessary to resolutely take on the responsibility of making public judgments on national affairs. This is not an excessive statement. Looking at those who have launched wars in the past, they often make explanations in their telegrams in order to win over reason. Whether they are appealing to the people or deceiving the people, it can be said that they have never completely abandoned the people in their minds. This is tantamount to acknowledging that the people have a kind of public judgment. If your association can truly fulfill its mission in this spirit, will it only receive the effect of treating the symptoms? For several years, I have never dared to seek correction from society with my remarks. I should be careful not to overstep my position in the era of political tutelage. I am just a lover of peace and deeply sympathize with the words of the benevolent. I am just expressing my feelings and attaching them to the meaning of mutual encouragement. If your association adopts them, I will be very fortunate. I respectfully wish you good health. Feng Bingnan respectfully.</p>

<p>Chen Lianbo, the former chairman of the Guangdong General Chamber of Commerce, current chairman of the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong, and a prominent industrialist from the South China region, recently arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. Mr. Chen has long advocated and initiated numerous public welfare and charitable undertakings in various southern regions. This spring in Hong Kong, he took the lead in initiating donations to Shanghai to aid refugees displaced by war and to support the 19th Route Army, reaching over a million dollars. Overseas Chinese in various ports in Southeast Asia, Europe, and America, hearing the news, eagerly joined in fundraising to support the patriotic army. Therefore, after Mr. Chen arrived in Shanghai, the leaders of the 19th Route Army, Chen Mingshu and Cai Tingkai, held banquets for several days to welcome him. The National Disaster Relief Association, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, the Guangzhao Public Association, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation, the Shanghai Joint Association of Various Groups for National Salvation, the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Economic Committee, the Road Construction Association, the Overseas Chinese Federation, the Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association, and other groups, as well as prominent figures such as Zhu Qinglan, Xiong Bingkun, Sun Hongyi, Chu Fucheng, and Huang Yanpei, hosted banquets one after another. Mr. Chen's visit was primarily to attend the annual shareholders' meeting of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and to fulfill his mission from the Tung Wah Hospital to Shanghai, discussing with Wen Qinfu and other directors of the Guangzhao Company various issues related to the relief of war-stricken refugees. Now that the Nanyang Tobacco Company meeting has concluded, some progress has been made regarding the relief of war victims. The Guangzhao Public Association has also scheduled a welcome meeting for Mr. Chen on the 28th of this month. It is reported that Mr. Chen, having largely completed his tasks, has decided to depart Shanghai on the 29th aboard the President Jefferson and return south.</p>

<p>The chairman of the Zhejiang Branch of the National Private Electric Power Industry Federation, Zhou Yangshan, and the vice-chairman, Han Yimin, of this organization located on Jiujiang Road in this city, previously submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan, stating that the Zhejiang Provincial Government had resolved that Yongjia County intended to collect an education surcharge on electricity consumption, which violated laws and regulations, and requested a prohibition on the collection. The Executive Yuan previously issued a directive stating, "The petition has been noted. This case has been referred to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for review. Subsequently, the reported circumstances of the case have been submitted for review and action by the Executive Yuan." It was determined that collecting a surcharge on electricity consumption was akin to levying excessive taxes, and the request for filing the record was not approved. The provincial government was instructed to swiftly forward an order to rescind the directive and comply with the filing of the record. This directive should be acknowledged.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Still Handled by the Ministry <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance responded to the Jiangsu tobacco and alcohol license tax matter. Since the four groups of Shanghai Tobacco Exchange, Li Baijiu Industry, Sauce and Liquor Industry, and Sauce Garden Industry read in the newspaper that the tax would be handled by the province with increased levies, they telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to inquire about the truth. These groups received the Ministry of Finance's printed directive No. 551 yesterday, which stated, "We have received your telegram. Upon investigation, the Jiangsu tobacco and alcohol license tax case was previously approved for direct management by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which requested direct consolidation. We immediately ordered the Finance Department to dispatch personnel to various counties to collect the tax and directly remit it to the provincial treasury." The Ministry stated that this license tax has always been directly collected by the Central Government, and all provinces have consistently followed this practice. Moreover, Article 2 of the Business Tax Law promulgated by the National Government clearly stipulates that it is a central government revenue item. The Ministry had previously replied via telegram to rescind the original proposal to avoid division and requested the Executive Yuan to issue an order to prohibit it on file. The claim in the newspaper that the Ministry approved the plan is entirely false. The associations must inform their colleagues not to easily believe rumors and cause unnecessary alarm. In addition to instructing the Jiangsu Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureau to earnestly collect taxes according to the old system, they should all comply with this directive." The associations have already recorded and circulated the order to their colleagues.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Patrolmen Abuse Authority and Extort Money <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Court Will Strictly Punish. Yilong in Laoximen is now newly developed by the municipal government into Heping Road. There are many small businesses setting up stalls along the roadside every morning. However, a useless patrolman named Gu Mingfu set up a stall beside a telephone pole, and Zhang Mingsan, a patrolman from the second district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, extorted three dollars from him every week. Because of this relationship, he abused his authority to beat Gu and completely ransacked his belongings. He was detained within the district, and the whereabouts of the sold goods are unknown. Gu Mingfu lost his livelihood and was forced to petition the local court for investigation. Prosecutor Wu was ordered to investigate and dispatched personnel to conduct a clear investigation, ordering the district to return the seized property to the victim. Patrolman Zhang Mingsan was prosecuted for extortion and abuse of authority and requested to be severely punished according to the law. Yesterday morning, Judge Shi opened the court and summoned Gu Mingfu to testify. Gu stated that he was forty years old, a native of Changshu, and lived in Menglou, selling food for a living. He said, "I sell rice and vegetables and have a permit. Zhang Mingsan extorted money from me, demanding one dollar per week, otherwise, I wouldn't be allowed to set up a stall. Because of my livelihood, I paid him three dollars, which I borrowed two dollars from Shen Xiaodi. A brush seller named A Genhu saw it. It was paid on May 21st. Unexpectedly, on May 28th, he asked me again, but because the deadline had not arrived, I didn't pay. He wouldn't let me sell, kicked over the rice and vegetable bucket, and snatched my belongings. I request an investigation." Zhang Mingsan testified that he was twenty-eight years old, a native of Hefei, and served as a policeman in the second district. He stated, "I didn't ask him for money because he was obstructing traffic." The judge said, "He's a villager; if you ask him for money, would he dare not pay? Besides, he has a permit."</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The judge asked, "Since you took his things, why didn't you take him?" He replied, "He ran away." The judge said, "You're a policeman; how dare he run away?" Then he questioned the witness, A Genhu, who stated that he was twenty-eight years old, a native of Kunshan, and sold brushes at the location. There were four vegetable and rice buckets in total. He saw Gu Mingfu pay three dollars, and later he asked for three dollars again and kicked over his stall. He also paid the policeman one dollar. The judge concluded the debate in this case and instructed the policeman to come to the court on the 30th of this month to await sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Fifth Report on Cholera from the Port Quarantine Office <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Wu Liande, Director of the Port Quarantine Office, issued the fifth weekly report on cholera, stating: (1) The prevalence of cholera in other ports has recently become almost as rampant as in Shanghai. For example, Guangzhou has exceeded 400 cases, Nanjing has exceeded 300 cases, and Tianjin has approximately 1,000 cases. In addition, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Hankou, Yantai, Qingdao, Beiping, Tanggu, Shantou, and other places have also discovered varying numbers of records of this disease. (2) The following is a list of the new cholera cases discovered up to the end of last week (June 25th), which have been bacteriologically confirmed, totaling 186 cases (including 11 deaths):</p>
<p>Region Patients Deaths Shanghai City 87 5 International Settlement 85 5 French Concession 14 1 Total 186 11 Previous 520 30 Total since discovery 706 41</p>
<p>The names of the hospitals admitting cholera patients and the number of cases are listed below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Epidemic Hospital 98 4 First Aid Epidemic Hospital 27 3 Hongkou Epidemic Hospital 28 0 Public Works Department Isolation Hospital 15 2 Red Cross Second Epidemic Hospital 14 2 Public Shanghai Hospital 2 0 Xinmin Road Red Cross Hospital 2 0 Total 186 11</p>
<p>Among the patients, there are six foreigners (one manager of a well-known German company, one British woman, one Filipino woman, one Portuguese, and two Japanese). (3) The Nanjing Health Department has supervised the health authorities of the city of Nanjing to begin testing public and private wells, numbering approximately one thousand or more, and has simultaneously undertaken disinfection work. All drinking water sources have also been subjected to bacteriological testing (because the capital does not yet have tap water facilities). It has been found that eight wells contain cholera bacteria. The well water is disinfected only with ordinary bleaching powder (containing 15 to 30 percent free chlorine) or with concentrated calcium hypochlorite, containing 65 percent free chlorine. Among those in contact with cholera in the capital, eight carriers have been isolated. Shanghai will also adopt the sanitary testing method of the capital to test natural wells and river water in order to disinfect drinking water sources. (4) The areas in Shanghai where cholera is most prevalent are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) Jessfield District (Caoxi Road and Zhoujia Bridge)</p>
<p>(B) Northwest corner of the International Settlement (surrounding Huishan Road and Xiaoshadu, near the inner and outer yarn factories)</p>
<p>(C) Zhabei (Tanzikou, Hujia Bridge, Xiangyan Bridge, Hongzhen, Wuzhen Bridge)</p>
<p>(D) Pudong (Lan Nidu, Yangjiazhai)</p>
<p>(E) Nanshi (Xieqiao, Jumen Road, Xietu Road, Dongjiadu)</p>
<p>(5) Letters have been sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers Association, various groups and organizations, and health authorities, etc., to seek their assistance in carrying out epidemic prevention work, in order to cooperate in eradicating the epidemic. In particular, it is urgent to provide cheap or free drinking water for the general poor. This matter is not difficult, as this port does not use water trucks, which could be used to meet the urgent need. Although the tap water company and society may suffer minor losses, the difference in importance is much greater than the loss of life, the decline of the market, the disruption of shipping, and unexpected admissions to hospitals. (6) Because cholera is prevalent and rampant, all sectors of society can hardly escape it. Therefore, everyone must know that if initial symptoms such as acute diarrhea and acute vomiting are found, they should be quickly transferred to the Epidemic Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. These hospitals are specially designed to prevent and treat this disease and are well-equipped for diagnosis and effective saline injection therapy. Moreover, during a cholera epidemic, this disease is extremely difficult to treat by ordinary methods. In short, the earlier the patient is admitted to the hospital, the more hopeful it is.</p>

<p>The land for the Jiangwan Epidemic Hospital was donated by Mr. Zhu Jiansheng of the Flour Exchange. Last year, the directors raised a large sum of money to build a new hospital on Gong'an Road. This spring, the hospital was burned by enemy fire during the Shanghai war, and the estimated repair cost is over 2,200 dollars. Now, through the introduction of Mr. Quan Yuanren, the Xu Bingji Construction Company has contracted to repair the interior of the building. In addition to raising 1,600 dollars, Xu Bingji has donated over 600 dollars to cover the shortfall, with a one-month deadline for completion. Because of the great calamity and the prevalence of epidemics, funds for annual expenses have been raised again. In addition, Mr. Tan Yasheng of the Universal Athletic Association has generously donated 300 dollars for medical expenses to help the sick. A temporary clinic has been temporarily set up in Caiyuan, Kuizhao Road, southwest of the town. Dozens of patients are admitted for treatment every day. Once the new building is repaired, it will be moved back to its original site.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Chaiqiao Five Bees Magnesium Carbonate Factory was established in 1922. It hires specialized chemical technicians to produce magnesium carbonate, a chemical industrial raw material and a daily necessity for medical and health purposes, using "Five Bees" as a registered trademark. Since its establishment, it has been widely sold throughout the country, resisting imported goods, regaining rights and interests, and assisting the rapid development of the chemical industry and new drug industry operated by Chinese people. Its effectiveness is immense. In the past, it has entrusted other companies to act as distributors in Shanghai, but it has not been able to promote the product vigorously. It has been reported that the factory has dispatched specialists to Shanghai to develop its business and facilitate customers. It has established an office at No. 2, Dongxing Lane, Danfeng Road, Xiaodongmen, to directly contact all sectors and welcome factories to purchase and use their products.</p>

<p>The Labor Department of the local Women's Christian Association, because of the multitude of factories in Shanghai, workers often disregard hygiene. Now that the summer season is abnormal and the tiger epidemic is prevalent, if no measures are taken to guide and prevent it, it will inevitably spread everywhere in the future, making relief even more difficult. Therefore, the department's workers' groups specially held a hygiene sports meeting at the Huxi Women Workers' Community last week. In addition to inviting members of the Municipal Health Bureau to lecture on summer hygiene methods and administer vaccinations, there were also recreational activities such as ventriloquism, film screenings, singing, and hygiene performances. The order of the meeting was entirely handled by the group members. After the meeting, the group members were also instructed to go out and distribute leaflets in various public alleys (such as methods for health and longevity, eliminating flies, the scourge of humanity, etc.) and lecture on public health and methods for preventing tiger epidemics. It is reported that 260 people attended that day, and 230 people received vaccinations.</p>

Army Commander Cai personally inscribed the words "Medicine for Saving the World" to commend the company. It is also reported that the company has recently found premises at 595 Ningbo Road as a distribution point for the purpose of developing its business.

<p>Many of the staff of William's Pharmacy in Shanghai reside in the Zhabei and Hongkou areas. As a result, many of them lost their furniture and clothing in the Japanese bombardment in February. The pharmacy, on the instructions of its Canadian headquarters manager and board of directors, issued substantial subsidies to these staff members to provide assistance. Therefore, 4,696 Shanghai dollars have already been distributed. Last Saturday (the 25th), the staff members who received these subsidies sent representatives to visit Mr. Wu Lifu, the general manager of the Shanghai branch, to express their gratitude. Mr. Xu Weigong, the Chinese manager who has been with the company for 24 years, requested Mr. Wu to convey their thanks to the manager and board of directors of the Canadian headquarters. In addition, it is worth noting that most of the Chinese staff members of the pharmacy have been with the company for a long time. Among them, two have been working since the Shanghai branch opened 24 years ago. Many others have been working for 23, 22, 20, or more than 16 years. Mr. Wu Lifu, the general manager of the Shanghai branch, has been serving the pharmacy in various locations, including South Africa, Singapore, and China, for as long as 37 years.</p>

<p>His spare time verses are exceptional,</p>

<h3 id="e201">Mr. Einstein Gives Up Curved Space <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Qian</p>
<p>Mr. Einstein, the creator of the theory of relativity, argued that space is curved, finite, and that a beam of light sent out can go around a big circle and come back. His theory shook the world.</p>
<p>But now, Mr. Einstein has abandoned his concept of curved space.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Einstein's opinion, space is probably infinite, three-dimensional, and light rays sent out will not return, which is the same as what scientists have always assumed. However, this change in concept has no impact on the truth of the theory of relativity.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why Mr. Einstein abandoned his curved space concept.</p>
<p>First, the observations from the Wilson Mountain Observatory show that the light bands of distant nebulae move towards the red end. The farther the nebula, the greater the movement. This proves that the universe is expanding constantly, and the rate of expansion is surprisingly high, 150,000 miles per second! Mr. Einstein used to think that space was finite, so in order to complete his theory, he assumed that space was curved. As for this expanding space, he had never thought of it.</p>
<p>Second, Dr. Heckman of Göttingen University in Germany has proved that expanding space can contain matter and still be Euclidean. Based on this hypothesis, Mr. Einstein abandoned his curved space argument.</p>
<p>Based on this new concept, Mr. Einstein can calculate the density of space using the equations in his theory of relativity. However, this density is smaller than we imagined. On average, there is only one pound of matter in a large empty sphere sixty times the diameter of the Earth. Space is constantly expanding, so the density is still decreasing day by day.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Snatching the Oily Perch <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>If you see a row of old houses on the side of the road with a new bamboo fence erected outside, then the houses are about to be demolished. After a considerable period of time, after the bamboo fence is removed, a row of new houses will suddenly appear before your eyes. The new houses naturally have new tenants, and if the house is close to the road, then many new shops will open next.</p>
<p>New shops, no matter what kind, will always sell things cheaper on the first day than the old shops. Although they may not be willing to lose money, it can be determined that they cannot make money that day. Therefore, the first day of business for a new shop is always very lively, and all the employees are always extremely busy and have to ask many people to help.</p>
<p>It is said that there are rules for new shops. The first person, holding a red paper packet in his hand, containing very little money, wants to buy very valuable things. The friends in the shop are not allowed to refuse him. So, two cents buys a pack of Golden Mouse cigarettes, four cents buys a ham, etc. Jokes like these are often heard on the first day of a new shop.</p>
<p>But if you want to be the first to walk into the door of the new shop and buy something very cheap and especially cheap, then you have to get up the night before and wait at the door of the shop. If you don't believe it, look, when the door of the new shop has not been removed, there are already many customers waiting outside. The first group of people get up early in the dark to prepare to snap up cheap goods. But if you want to be the first to run into the shop door, you must have strength, otherwise you will be pushed out of the crowd, and you will never be able to squeeze into the crowd.</p>
<p>Going to a new shop to buy cheap goods is called "snatching the oily perch." We also have this kind of rule in our hometown. When a new row of shops opens in a town, people from all over the countryside come to snatch the oily perch. They are far from the town, but they are waiting at the door before dawn, so you know they get up the night before. I remember when I was a child, a new butcher shop opened across from my house. A friend slept at the door the night before. The next day, when the butcher shop opened, he was the first to go in and bought a pig's leg for two cents. Jokes like these are often heard.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, as soon as a new shop opens, the old nanny tells the old lady, the young lady tells the nanny, the chauffeur tells the young master, the little brother and sister tell their mother. The news will spread quickly. So, on the day of the opening, the customers are always as lively as they can be.</p>
<p>Chinese merchants, especially in Shanghai, are extraordinarily jealous. If one shop sells cheap goods, the competitors will immediately compete with them. New shops are also the same. If a new shop opens, the competing shops on the same road will also hang lanterns and streamers, play military music, and sell their cheap goods. Recently, a new pharmacy opened on Xinza Road. The nearby competitors also hung lanterns and streamers and sold cheap goods in the same way, but there were very few customers. It was not as lively as other types of shops. Taking medicine is originally an unlucky thing. If you are not sick, who would go to snatch the oily perch? At the same time, I am reminded that if a coffin shop opens, maybe no one will go to snap up cheap goods.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Graduates' Way Out <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Shui</p>
<p>Mr. C, who is busy with graduation exams, only came to my house for a chat the night before last. Naturally, I couldn't help but congratulate him. I asked him:</p>
<p>"Four years of university life, today can be considered the end! That must be your proudest day!"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? I just survived four years and finished a section!" he said.</p>
<p>"Then, are you going to the East or the West?" I asked him again.</p>
<p>"It's not easy to talk about. Not to mention going abroad to study, I don't even have a way out right now!" he said.</p>
<p>"Those are just polite words," I glanced at him, with a somewhat believing and somewhat disbelieving attitude, and asked him again.</p>
<p>Then he was silent for a while, and then, frowning, he solemnly replied to me:</p>
<p>"Alas! Old classmate, let's not talk polite words! Not to mention anything else, it has taken us such families a lot of effort to get a university degree! Still thinking about going abroad? That's just a dream! Look, recently classmate K went to M City. I heard that his relatives have immediately found him a good job, so he's going there to take up his new post! Classmate L also went to K City, but I'm the only one still wandering at the crossroads. The other day, I ran into an old classmate, Mr. W, whom I hadn't seen for five years. He is the director of the political department of the XX Army, and he's going to F Province to suppress bandits soon. Maybe there's a way out there? But I was born with a very solitary nature. On the one hand, I can't get used to the life in the army, and on the other hand, I don't want to step into the class with guns. But if I don't go, these major problems of food, clothing, and shelter cannot be solved. Alas! It's really depressing!"</p>
<p>"He paused for a while and continued to say to me: Now, I regret that I studied! If my parents hadn't taught me to study, like my uncle's son, I would be farming and planting vegetables at home every day, which would be so happy. But what about me? I spend eight hundred yuan a year and waste a lot of precious time, but in the end, I can't find a way out. Isn't that a joke? Alas! In the final analysis, it's all the bad social environment that makes us graduates panic about unemployment!"</p>
<p>After hearing these words, I naturally expressed a lot of sympathy in my heart. In fact, how many people in Chinese society are feeling the same pain as Mr. C right now? I think; in this society where politics is not on the right track, the standards for employing people are chaotic. No matter how talented and knowledgeable you are, if you don't have those key figures in the political arena to promote you, I'm afraid you'll be buried for decades and still can't raise your head! Alas! "Graduates' Way Out"</p>

<h3 id="e204">Opium, Mahjong, and Feasts <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Hao Ying</p>
<p>A narrow and pitifully small Baoshan City, | our hometown, was still in the pockets of the enemy a month ago; now, we can finally freely enter and exit and live peacefully in our own broken houses that have been pierced by artillery shells.</p>
<p>The houses are empty. Finding a pair of chopsticks and a broken eating bowl is simply a dream. What we have are high piles of garbage outside the walls, and several volumes of magazines abandoned by the "enemy" in the grass piles in the yard.</p>
<p>I curiously picked up that volume of Japanese magazine with more than 500 pages and flipped through it page by page. Needless to say, the rich materials and large number of illustrations in it cannot be found in any first-rate magazine in China. In particular, the research on the three northeastern provinces of China. On the other hand, the magazine published many illustrations ridiculing China. Although I don't understand Japanese and cannot fully understand the text annotating these illustrations, what the illustrations indicate to me, and the occasional Chinese characters in Japanese, are enough to provide a stimulus for someone worn out by chaos!</p>
<p>We only need to pick one to talk about: The topic is "Chinese Y Faces (Prestige)" It depicts a person who looks exactly like an old Chinese gentleman. A melon-skin cap and old glasses are indispensable. He is wearing a huge black mandarin jacket, hunched over his back, and has his hands folded on the table. In front of him are three indispensable living materials: a smoking pipe, mahjong tiles, and big fish.</p>
<p>In a short paragraph explaining the illustrations, one can still find these phrases piecemeal: "::Senior officials:: One day:: Few:: Two or three banquets." "Mahjong:: Opium:: Also they:: Important components of life::"</p>
<p>What beautiful faces of the Chinese people! Here, there is enough for us to ponder!</p>
<p>This is indeed the truth; First, the power of Mahjong to penetrate Chinese society is even more universal than Danish education. Whether illiterate women, underdeveloped children, noble (!) officials, or humble (!) carters, they will all pull up four companions for another four rounds. This widespread gambling tool has not only become a wonderful item for social interaction and a tool for leisure, but among the general idle class it has become almost as important a condition of life as food, clothing, and shelter! Second, although opium is not as popular as Mahjong in China, the total number of smokers, when counted, is bound to be huge and astonishing. Taking our Baoshan City, with a population of five or six thousand, as an example, there are already more than forty "swallow nests." Others who smoke and burn themselves are not included. Each "swallow nest" has an average of ten regular customers, which amounts to four or five hundred people! Baoshan is like this, but other places such as Sichuan, Anhui, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Fujian, where poppies are grown, even women and children smoke them, then Baoshan's achievements are far behind! Third, regarding banquets with big fish and big meat, the daily newspaper reports about officials inviting guests and holding banquets, and capitalists drinking and eating wildly, will really make people forget all the difficult and shameful encounters. General "political maniacs," petty politicians, and junior officials often use inviting guests (of course, lavish and beautiful) as a stepping stone to advancement or as a means of ingratiation. Others, such as weddings, funerals, and celebrations among the people, always hold several or dozens of tables of grand banquets, inviting relatives and friends to feast. With all this, the Japanese satirize us: Taking opium, playing mahjong, and holding big fish and big meat banquets as a matter of face, do we still have room to defend ourselves?</p>
<p>Friends! Has everyone lived through this era? Have you seen the current environment? Can we continue like this forever?</p>

<h3 id="e205">Finished Reading "The Road" <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Meng</p>
<p>During the bitter plum rains of several days, in my depression, I finished reading Mao Dun's "The Road." Mao Dun used to report on overseas literary news in "Short Story Monthly". At that time, everyone did not know that he was a great Chinese genius. Later, because he participated in the political movement, he saw a lot of things, so all the revolutionary and morbid facts became his complex subject matter. By the time his trilogy was completed, the literary world exclaimed in unison at his descriptive skills.</p>
<p>My brother Ji Cheng is very familiar with him. They used to be colleagues at the Commercial Press, and later they were jointly responsible for editing the "Literary Ten-Day Magazine" at the Literary Research Association. According to him: "Mao Dun writes novels so powerfully, largely because he was influenced by the French writer Maupassant." I believe this very much, and I think Mao Dun himself would admit this.</p>
<p>"The Road" is also one of Mao Dun's recent works, but it is not as profound as "Disillusionment", "Hesitation", and "Pursuit". The materials are not as rich and moving as the trilogy. However, compared to the many works that waste paper and ink in vain, "The Road" is still a good novel worth publishing. In the youth consciousness of being at a loss, he still grasped the soul of the times, he found a way out for some young people between the dead ends!</p>
<p>Politics is not on the right track, and there is nothing to be done. The education sector, which has been in turmoil almost every day for several years, is unfolding in the same way as the warlords' civil war. Inside, we see the crisis of Chinese education, we see the moral bankruptcy of educators; the children to be saved are struggling in the water and fire with unrestrained enthusiasm. They | the young students | are neither good at making plans nor can they compromise. So he, Xin | the protagonist of the novel, is skeptical with tears in his eyes. After the first wave of unrest, he is passive and pessimistic; the second time, he becomes mad and desperate. He knows that it is all wrong, "Be tenacious, neither passive nor mad. A war of attrition"!</p>
<p>The impatience of the youth is a mess.</p>
<p>Xin said: "Sacrifice is nothing. There are many people like that. It's no good for me at all." The gray society! The gray nation is waiting for the youth's hot blood to be defiled and washed away!</p>
<p>Xin asked Du Ruo: "Don't you love me?"</p>
<p>"Love! It's my own way of loving. It can let you love for a while!" Du Ruo answered him. The romantic love view of modern girls is true. Mao Dun is very sure about the analysis and dissection of all kinds of things. About our motherland's current tribulations, what efforts should we writers make in literature and thought to find our way?</p>
