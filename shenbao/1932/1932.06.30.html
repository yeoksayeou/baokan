<h3 id="c1">「剿匪」與「造匪」 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>邇近共黨勢力。日益披猖。湘鄂贛閩川以至皖豫。都有燎原之勢。政府當局認爲「攘外必先安内。」故於日軍撤退之後。即動員大軍。四次圍剿。蔣介石氏且躬親出發督師。爲此一問題。國内各報。都曾著評論列。槪認「匪」之滋生。爲由於政治之不良。與生計之窮蹙。初非好亂成性。故「匪」不可以剿而絶。要當改革政治。改造農村。安定民生。整飭軍隊。絶「匪」所以滋生之源。論皆精闢。語尤沉痛。吾人亦認爲今日舉國之「匪。」皆黑暗之政治所造成。政治上旣一面造「匪。」政府復一面剿「匪。」在此矛盾之行爲下。「匪」旣絶不能以剿而絶。或且以剿而勢日以張大。抑且所剿之「匪。」何莫非我勞苦之同胞。何莫非飢寒交迫求生不得之良民。槍口不以對外。而以之剿殺因政治經濟兩重壓迫鋌而走險之人民。正如楊杏佛氏所言「對殺人放火奸淫　掠之日軍。旣委曲求全。禮讓言和。請其撤退」。獨對於國内鋌而走險之人民。則竟動員大軍。大張撻伐。此誠爲吾人所不解者也。</p>
<p>我國農民之特性。爲質樸堅忍。安分守已。而保守性又特重。初無人習於作亂。抑且鄉井之戀念。家庭之眷愛。非萬不獲已。孰肯背鄉離井。抛妻别兒。出没山谷。置生命於最危險之境界。其所以然者。則以政治與經濟兩重壓力逼迫之故。人皆惡死。人皆樂生。求生不得。誰甘坐死。奮死求生。人之常情。政治黑暗。生計窮盛。民不爲「匪。」更又何路。民旣爲「匪。」則惟剿殺。故曰「剿匪」者政府。而「造匪」者實即黑暗之政治也。</p>
<p>吾人言此。初非無所依據。實因目擊萬千無辜之良民。屈死於慘毒之砲火之下。而且匪勢披猖。又誠爲我國當前之一大問題。故不得不言。且又不忍不言。</p>
<p>五月四日何應欽氏在江西全省清匪會議上演說有曰。「上年剿赤之時。聞吉安太和等縣長有擅發自新證。要平民每月納費五百文。否則即認爲赤匪。在表面看來。雖爲數不多。但在平民担負不易。我到南豐的時候。也有同樣的事發生。還有吉安縣黨部的委員胡正誼。假購鎗辦保衛圑爲名。勒索綁民的金錢數十元數百元不等。後經人告發。他已逃之夭夭。此種政治不良。逼迫良民從匪。影響剿赤的進行不少。」</p>
<p>六月粤第一軍長余漢謀氏電告粤省政府亦云。「查贛南一隅。遮斷陷落。各成甄脫。一般貪官污吏。以統治者鞭長莫及。利用時機。不惜勾結士劣。恣爲魚肉。上下交征。層層壘剝。　　者氓。呼籲無門。怨　日積。從匪日衆。跡若輩之所爲。實予匪以假借煽惑之良好機會。其罪不啻間接製匪。」</p>
<p>復如監察委員鄭螺生談張貞禍漳有曰。「駐軍平日旣不從事清鄉。復恣意勒索。如稅契一項。除正規外。駐軍司令部更随意將民房估價。計每千元。抽稅契六十元。此次共黨竄擾漳州。離城尙有數十里。時張貞旣不出城抵抗。且全師退往雲霄詔安。人民有乘汽車逃亡者。一槪禁止。所有汽車。完全供運烟土及現欵之用。城内子彈二百萬發。復棄以資敵。旣抵雲霄詔安後。即在兩縣公賣烟土。以飽私囊。查國家養兵。原以保民。民之不保。更從而殃之。此而不懲。何以慰民。」</p>
<p>上述諸事。或爲剿匪將領之目擊。或爲政府要員所親聞。凡兹所述。應皆爲事實。如其果實。則貪官雜軍。即皆爲「匪」之製造者。爲淵毆魚。爲叢毆雀。是何能怪良民從匪日衆。匪勢日益張大。抑且如上所述。實不僅爲某一縣某一省之現象。舉國殆無不皆然。不僅地方之貪官污吏如是。即中央近年來病民之舉指。要亦難免不爲不爲間接製匪之洪爐。凡此種種。吾人容當續爲陳述。</p>

<p>商輪失事、近來層見迭出、而觸礁失火、又接踵而起、太古公司之盛京輪、在威海衛甫經拖救出險、又有上江輪萬流號、在重慶下流觸礁沉没之事發生、兹經記者向各方面調查所得眞相、特爲報告如下、</p>
<p>失事原因　太古公司之揚子江上游班輪、分爲大船與淺水兩種、大船中共有三隻、即萬縣·萬流·及萬通·是也、該三輪載量各有一千一百戧餘噸、每年在川河漲水後行駛之、本年三輪入川行駛、往來宜渝、此次萬流號輪、從重慶運載貨客、開赴萬縣宜昌而來上海、適値江水大漲、該輪在重慶下水、行抵黃家坡江面、距重慶約一百四五十里、船身錯走航道、誤行入暗礁叢中、當時猛然一聲、該輪突然觸礁、其船頭部首先撞進礁石之上、立即破裂、</p>
<p>引擎損壞　萬流輪撞進暗礁、其船頭部即穿上礁石、前艙艙底經暗礁之猛擦、即行破裂、而中艙爲引擎機關間、係全船主要部分、當遭礁石穿破、江水乃猛冲入船、霎時間前艙進水八尺、未久引擎間亦進水一小時中水浸至九尺、而機器間之爐鍋、亦被江水浸熄、全船頓成黑暗、且不能行動矣、幸而艙底爲礁石擱住、否則早已下沉矣、</p>
<p>員客救護　該輪失事之際、全船乘客、頓起恐慌、且懲於捿江·彝陵·輪在羊肚溪觸礁、一分鐘下沉、旅客全皆溺斃、都紛紛奔集甲板、爭圖逃命、幸由船主等極力安慰、告以船底擱在礁石、不致即没、而人心稍定、遂經船主拉求救回聲、並發火翦、未幾有民營木船多艘經過該處、得聞求援聲、爭來援救、先將輪中搭客用舢板駁上各民船、陸續載赴宜昌上陸、嗣後重慶·太古·分頭亦得到萬流失事電報、遂令萬縣等船往救、故全部船員乘客、未受損傷、均安然逹到宜昌、</p>
<p>輪體下沉　該輪擱礁之後、以船底破裂過甚、漸向下沉、又爲重儎、容易陷沉、幸有礁石托住、故沉没亦得稍緩、現在該輪雖仍在石上、但頭二三四艙完全入水、至今水已没過第三層台甲、祇留烟囱及風斗等在江面、其他完全没在江内、公司方面、即欲撈救該輪、現在亦無辦法、須俟在冬令水淺後、再行打撈、</p>
<p>損失大槪該輪爲太古之頭等上江船、載重一千一百八十噸、係向滬上隆茂洋行所購進之隆茂輪而改爲今名者、船身在江南船廠定造、引擎機件、均極優美、而船身鐵板又厚、當時造價爲四十萬元、而此次下水在川、又裝載藥才絲綢等雜貨甚多、悉皆陷入輪内、又有船員乘客之行李銀錢等項、損失至少六十萬元、今公司對於該輪各艙之貨物、其可以駁卸者、尙擬打撈一部出險、</p>

<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>四十二次日早晨，在朱先生的書棹上，我看見一張紙條子，上面寫的是這幾句話：</p>
<p>『「城裏不要他，跑到鄉下來。」</p>
<p>他們這樣說，便算我無才。』</p>
<p>一位初到鄉下來的人受了這個打擊，隨便怎樣逹觀的人，總難免有些灰吧。朱先生却毫不介意，最少，他面上是没有一點牢騷的樣子。他寫的四句詩，初看淡如米湯，但是字裏行間仔細觀察，祇見一位肯吃小虧的先生是在紙上活躍。我對朱先生說：『從前有人說過：「我自爲龍爲虎任人呼馬呼牛。」先生所寫的那首小詩，是有這種抱負。』朱先生說：隨手寫來，聊作努力修養的參考罷了。算不得什麽抱負。但是你旣提及兩句成語，我倒想把牠們顛倒過來，做我們大家互相勉勵的方針。龍爲代怪物，老虎有時吃人，那牛馬纔是民衆的忠僕咧。』他說了便拿起筆寫：</p>
<p>『我自爲牛爲馬：任人呼虎呼龍。』</p>
<p>『你看如何？』『你這樣一改使我在榮苦的生活中看出一種新使命。你在面前的平凡境界裏開拓出一種不可描寫的奇境。我是决定要跟你在這奇中去漫游了。』</p>
<p>朱先生雖是逹觀，但地在這裏的工作是受了很大的阻力。「古廟裏的先没本事」是傳遍了人間，一直傳到張鬍子的烟舗上。磚匠老許於是與張子聯盟反對朱先生，唆使家長學生不與朱先生合作。</p>

<h3 id="c183">不謙吉和謙不吉 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>卦爻有凶有吉，惟謙卦，六爻皆吉：彼都人士，把謙吉兩字題名的，很多很多。即就最近而論，有了出席國聯的芳澤謙吉：又有侵略淞滬的植田謙吉：又有率領僞國選手赴洛杉磯參加世界運動大會的齋藤謙吉。左一個謙吉，右一個謙吉，再來一個謙吉；似乎扶桑三島，成了謙謙君子的出產地。</p>
<p>但是，循名核實，一個都不好算謙謙君子｜第一個謙吉，在國聯席上，顚倒黑白，是已非人：謙在那裏？第二個謙吉，領兵到淞滬，厮殺一月之久：謙在那裏？第三個謙吉，出席世界運動會，準備替僞國擴大宣傳，助成叛逆；謙在那裏？他們三個人，其名曰謙，其實相反；與其喚做謙吉，不如老老實實喚一聲不謙吉。</p>
<p>我們中國人，倒有許多謙謙君子；聲明長期抵抗的，變做長期不抵抗了。爲什麽長期不抵抗？爲着要做謙謙君子。聲明不受强權壓迫的，現在却簽名在協定上了。爲什麽簽名在協定上？只爲要做謙謙君子。照這麽說，謙謙君子的出產地，不在扶桑三島，而在我們中國了！</p>
<p>但是，謙字的眞諦是，謙在對内，不是謙在對外的。對外做了謙謙君子那麽喪權辱國，便顧不得許多了！似這般的謙謙君子，不在謙卦範圍以内，只怕六爻都不吉吧。所以，我們中國的謙謙君子，却有三字定評，呌做謙不吉。</p>
<h3 id="c184">人之長短比例談 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>此次河南人常樹德。由京來滬養病於醫院中。見者爲之　詫。謂年未及壯。而身昂逾人數倍。前在吉鴻昌部任掌旗官。及首都全國運動會辦事員。日必食鷄一隻。雞子四十枚。復以麵首二十四個當午餐。亦可謂奇人已。而復有矮人唐益三。年已四十。身長不满三尺。爲四川南邑人。家庽蕯坡賽路。亦曾任川中某軍事偵探。一時長短輝映。無獨有偶。侈爲奇談。喧傳海上。憶前四年有長人劉汝清。自美回國。生擁厚貲。優游北平。今常樹德亦在榮記大世界與人會晤。作公開話别會。然後起程赴歐美各國游歷云。如以短人唐益三比之。不啻籬下燕雀。徒自啾啾。仰望鳳烏之冲霄直上也。研究人類學者。恒謂古人長而今人短。有身橫數畝。一指可揜太行。春秋載長狄僑如者。然其高度亦不詳。文王十尺。湯九尺。曹交九尺四寸。乃又曰五尺之童。古今尺度之不倫。於此可見。顧人之修短與種族之强弱。固不無關係。余考今之最短者爲墨洲北境愛斯及莫。與歐洲北部接朋之人。長　四尺餘。呂宋麻六甲人亦短。斐洲南之黑人。居於森林中。最長止三尺餘。最長者爲腦威人。加拿大之法人。與夫紅人斐東之加弗爾人。及南之巴太公人。澳洲人長都五尺餘。皆以今之尺度相較。大率如是。</p>
<p>然有天賦優異者。昔清光緒十三年間。有一希臘人來滬。長七尺五寸强。法國之馬兵。乃與之比肩而立。竟過其頂。而奥國人某。長至八尺七寸。莫敢與較。此皆載之於製造局千奇萬妙一書中。固斑斑可考者。時徽人詹某。亦以身長著聞於滬上。嗣爲某西人挈去。得以昂遊海外。满載而回。賦形之初。不知天何以生是獨優也。聞有俄人某。年已二十許。重止五法斤。長不過一尺五寸。其父愛之若掌珠。常扶之立於几上。以相嬉戲。其短小可想。日人我國恒呼之爲矮奴。而謚之曰『疙瘩多。』此次日軍犯我邑中。乃舍老東洋（日司令部之通譯音。）一人外。其　幹莫不魁碩高大。勝於吾軍。識者謂自四十年來。其平均長度。歲有增加。至今已加長逹一尺五六寸之譜。其說近是。噫·覘民族性者。亦可於此得之矣。</p>
<h3 id="c185">讀陳樹人畫展以後 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>首都藝壇。岑寂已久。俗塵蝟集。逸興蕭然。値此炎威張熾。心靈愈感枯燥。適樹人先生畫展開幕。乃偕縵華一讀佳作。會塲假中央大學新建之國民會議會塲。左側樓上下兩廳。陳列作品數十幅。山水與翎毛花卉。各佔其半。用筆柔和。風格獨標。其寫桂林山水。用中鋒鈎勒。傅以單純色彩。峯巒疊嶂。怪石　峋。余愛其「獨秀峯」。「象鼻山」。「江干釣艇」「鼎湖飛瀑」諸作。以輕靈筆觸。寫水色山光。具有詩的韻味。吾友賓虹先生。數年前曾作桂林之游。歸示所作。不禁神往。而善孖大千昆仲。探勝黃山。余子劍華傲游雁蕩。仰觀俯察。囊括以歸。其作品早與國人相見。中國山水。自荆關以降。雖代有巨人。然陳陳相因。殊少創造意味。作家而能對自然界努力。實爲復興國畫之不二法門。</p>
<p>寫花卉之最精者。當推「桃花帶雨濃」。「嶺南春色」。「梨花帶雨」。及「新柳」。「春光」。色彩明艷。楚楚動人。尺幅問充满清新空氣。「嶺南春色」一幀。曾出品比國博覽會。予歐人以賞識。是年余適偕民誼先生赴歐。參與其事。曾經先覩。余憶其「春光」一幀題句云。「不盡滔滔奔競心。有何人肯到山林。可憐無限春光好。領略惟同一小禽」。作者之胸懷淡泊。可窺一斑。</p>
<h3 id="c186">首都之衛生事業 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 蕙子</p>
<p>首都之衛生事業。首推巨孹者。當爲中央醫院。病房建築材料購自美國。一切開辦經費需百萬元。由衛生部主辦。規模雖大惜成績不佳。因該院有一最苛之規例。即重症不收是。如肺癆病並非不可治。亦禁阻收容。頗爲民衆不满。</p>
<p>今年虎列拉。在南京流傳甚烈。至每年之死於傷寒症者。幾佔全市死亡率百分之六十以上。衛生署诿諉其責於市衛生局。自衛生局撤消。談者皆謂自應由衛生署負責。顧傳染病之流行。反有燎原之勢。吁可嘆也。查賬災會及庚欵中之撥用防疫費。僅南京一處。已不下二百萬元。不知此欵用於何處。</p>
<p>軍醫最高機關。有軍政部之軍醫司。在辦理傷兵療養。頗著成績。忌嫉軍醫界之範圍闊大者。不乏其人。皆欲攫得軍醫司一席。但軍醫爲專門事業。非普通醫之所能問津。於是彼輩遂巧立名目。借端干涉。例如前之軍醫監部。及今之軍醫設計監理委員會。皆由忌嫉一念爲之動機。遂不惜虚耗國帑爲此疊床架屋之舉。吾人平心論事。人選可動。機關不可變更。倘軍醫司長辦理不當。則逕易好司長可耳。何必於一機關之外。又設一類似機關。如十七年之軍醫監理委員會。去年之軍醫監部。今年之軍醫設計監理委員會。皆屬巧立名目。徒令人興政令紛歧之慨。疊床架屋之譏。忽設忽裁。毫無根據。是直視國事如兒戲耳。（不受酬）</p>

<p>— 鏡清</p>
<p>滬上各圑體救國聯合會。前晚　别十九軍各將士於大中華飯店。觥籌交錯錯。一堂濟濟。座作山字形。中央主席。爲民黨耆英孫伯蘭。雖　髮蒼然。精神矍　。左右爲蔡軍長翁旅長等。喪鄂英姿。羣殷瞻仰。悃愊無華。沉毅亢亢爽。有足多者。　雄談之驚座。識名將之匪虚也。</p>
<p>席上蔡軍長演詞。略謂上海上海民衆之合力扶助。永矢勿諼。雖地方塗炭。炭。對敝軍民無怨色。謬採虚聲。過蒙奬飾。謙光讓德。情見乎詞。翁旅長語語多温婉。結語並謂十九軍之退守。實爲彈盡乏援而不能抗。絶非不抵抗。尙尙望中樞鞏固閩省國防。注重空軍云云。丘參謀語多激昂沉痛。并剪哀梨。足足以方之。</p>
<p>是晚某記者曾面詢蔡軍長。謂閩邊共黨。傳有十九軍來。願偃旗息鼓。支以示尊崇之意等語。有諸。蔡軍長答以道聽塗說。無足介意。要亦感人深矣。。惟於歡宴之際。終覺　然凄戀。蓋丹忱衛國。不惜犧牲者。萬衆　留。惟恐恐其去之速。祗知蠻觸相爭。殘民以逞。千夫所指。惟恐其不去。甚者詆爲棘棘門瀉上。恃勇失機。是亦别具肺腸。何足爲訓。始終未加一矢。所謂長期抵抵抗。整個計劃者佑在。約援偏誤王侁。掣肘又逢　子。雖竭司馬囊底之智。。難當木牛渭上之兵。終致楚歌四面。功敗垂成。斯所謂精衛含怨。難塡恨海海者也。</p>
<p>萬目時艱。杞憂满懷。九夏沸騰。集　未已。昔東晋諸名士。於新亭宴飲。飲。顧　嘆曰。風景不殊。舉目有山河之異。皆相視流涕。獨王導愀然變色曰曰。當共戮力皇室。克復神州。何至作楚囚相對。疇昔之宴。何異新亭。寇深深矣。禍亟矣。吾人試一念及東北瀹胥。滬地刦灰。及陣亡將士之孤嫠屍骨。。青憐碧血。不待一一呈演眼簾。當如擁門之絃。未彈而先淚。斯亦臨　嘆息息。不能自已者也。今十九軍行矣。長征千黑。意氣如雲。一旅興夏。將企望望之矣。此去苔痕萍影。馬腹鞭長。何年　館莎廳。　頭席共。南天　望。不盡不盡依依。</p>

<p>第十一回　偏枯小邑瞻仰牙旌　猥瑣羣流呵從騶</p>
<p>幸而事事順手。活該這老狗要栽觔斗在我手裏。找着了一位胡諮議。他與葉大師很說得來話。從旁重重的軋了那老狗一下。棄大帥就批准了我的狀紙。特派胡諮議來查辦他。又凑巧我同時還幹着了安司令這一邊的事。再由我替安胡二位切實一拉攏。約齊了大家一塊兒來。藉安司令的幾桿槍替胡諮議壯壯聲勢這還怕不把那老狗一搥頭打扒下嗎等到這老狗一栽了來安胡二位在省裏都很有脚手。又準能爲胡諮議運動到繼任這個現成的縣缺。將來胡諮議一上任安司令仍在此地辦招撫。内外合起手來是多麽好辦事。還要用這老狗做甚你們看我這些個好章法。該計畫得多麽巧妙。不愧爲一個好軍師和頂呱呱的好參謀長吧。不過擠倒了這老狗以後。我已不屑再幹從前的老買賣。倒眞成了一種坦白白無私的義舉。爲地方上除了害。替一般紳士們留下了飯了。現在說是已經說說給你們聽。郤須爲我暫時守着秘密。别要被那老狗探得了風聲。又要另搗什麽鬼。這干人聽罷。一個個都吐出舌頭來。稱讚這鄔四爺高明强大的手腕。。并賭神發咒。請鄔四爺萬安。我等决不能走漏消息半點。鄔四爺愈說愈發狂狂。索興還大誇海口道。就是被那老狗得了信息。也不要緊。我已把天羅地網網撒開。决不怕他再有什麽極大的神通。會逃得脫我這手掌心。又那曉得言多多究竟有失。後來終讓李品齊没吃着他的眼前明虧呢。在這一千人中。就有一人一人還眞是奉了李品齋的囑托。專爲刺探這大對頭鄔進祿的消息而來。旣把眞眞情實話套出。當時再敷衍了鄔四爺一番。便約同大家起身告辭。連夜去到縣縣衙告密。如今且把縣衙和旅館兩方面的情形。趁這夜間照例是一宿無話的當當兒。暫行擱住不提。先將安玉田怎麽會同着這一般人赫赫威靈踏到這海定縣縣來的經過事實。略行表叙明白。</p>

<p>— 克</p>
<p>夏天一到、太陽和火傘一般的高張在天空，我們少不得要用草帽來保護腦子，不過，白色的草帽，很容易累着污點，並且隔了一年或二年的草帽，往往會泛成黃色，色澤狠不鮮明，戴起來也就不雅觀。現在讓我來介紹刷新草帽的方法給大衆們！</p>
<p>（甲）洗草帽法：事前準備：（一）炭酸鈵（即蘇逹）。（二）石鹹（三）硫黃（四）有孔之木箱（五）柔軟之毛刷（六）樹膠水（此非必需）有了以上各物，先用軟毛刷蘸石鹹溶液將草帽洗帽乾凈，再浸入炭酸鈵（SodiumCarbonateNa2Co3）溶液（約一合炭酸鈉，二升清水）中，然後再用清水漂清，在未乾以前，速懸入有孔之木箱内，下面以硫黃壎之，過二小時，取出再以稀薄之蘇逹溶液漂洗，更用清水洗凈，懸於通風處陰乾，此時帽已潔白如新。若硬質草帽，陰乾後更塗上一層稀薄之樹膠水，晒乾後用布巾用力摩擦，則光澤煥發，可與購來時無異。</p>
<p>（乙）刷草帽法：此法比較上要簡單，祇須將輕養化鈣（即熟石灰CalciumhydroxideCa(OH)2)溶在温水中，用軟毛刷蘸水細刷之，至刷白以後，再用清水漂洗乾凈，懸在通風處陰乾，不過大家要記牢，切忌在日光下曝晒。</p>
<p>以上洗刷草帽的方法，都是根據化學上的原理而來，草帽所以要在未乾時用硫黃燻，就是因爲硫黃在空氣中燃燒，即在二氣化硫（ＳＯ２）這二氧化硫氣能漂白，因其遇水而發生之　，能使顏色物還原故也。由此看來，硫黃之壎草帽，實爲洗草帽中最重要的手續。</p>

<h3 id="c210">「長材」止此！ <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 松盧</p>
<p>記得在去年的秋間，那時候南京方面正轟轟烈烈的忙着開全國運動會，爲了欲使會塲的莊嚴和威肅起見，特從河南吉鴻昌部下去聘了一位八尺二寸的長人常樹德來管大門，當時不侫見了這個消息，曾在某報上做了一篇「長材得展」的諧文，劈頭就寫了如下的一首歪詩：</p>
<p>「身長八尺二，鬰鬰不得志；　　一朝時運來，會塲作門吏！」</p>
<p>内容無非是假今證古的對那長人說了許多調侃和勉勵的話；但是事變之來，莫可究詰，自從九一八事變後，轟轟烈烈的全運會，也無形的烟散雲消了！那位長人常樹德的「長材，」也依然未能「得展，」以致偃蹇旅邸，幾乎不得一飽，說來也就很覺可憐了！</p>
<p>果然，「喬木之材，不患無用。」古人之言，信不我欺，斗大的「長人常樹德」廣告，赫然突現於眼簾了！原來長人已爲大世界主人所招致，在該場所謂「與人公開相見」了。</p>
<p>其實這也是意中之事，去年我早經說過：長材如果没有出路，不妨上明星公司去拍影戲，如今長人不現身於銀幕之上，而露臉於大世界給人當怪物看，雖其出路不同，而長材之得展者則一。</p>
<p>受了廣告力的吸引，使我也破費了兩毫小洋，去賞鑒賞鑒這獨一無二的老牌長人。當我踏進了大世界，在三層樓找到了長人，演藝的處所時，却又使我受到一種失望。</p>
<p>原來長人不是可以白看的，他藏在一間斗室裏，再要化二角門票，方可賞識他的廬山眞面。</p>
<p>長人也是一個「人，」他也有眼睛，有鼻樑，據說他除了身段比常人長得多外，其餘便是他的食量大，能比常人多裝些飯，此外也就無所其長了。</p>
<p>然而長人畢竟是「活人！」所以他能哄動一般人去看，否則的話：杭州靈隠寺的四大金剛，要比長人長得多呢，怎的也没人呌一聲希奇？</p>
<p>看過了長人之後，朋友中没有見過長人的爭來問我，長人畢竟如何？我道：「長材止此！」</p>

<p>鄉中張封翁，誰也說他是一個有福氣的人，四個兒子，三個女兒，更加上繞膝這麽多的孫子外甥。一家不下二十餘人吃飯，好不熱閙，好不令人艷羡！</p>
<p>的確，張封翁是很有福氣的。他旣不少錢，十多萬的家私，在鄉下也要算首富了：又不少壽，六十晋五的高壽：更不少兒孫。全合着古人的三祝：「多福」，「多壽」，「多男子」的願望。在外人看來他該十分满足的了，還有何求？</p>
<p>但在枯寂的老人心中，常挑起一些寂寞之感，感到無限的煩悶。大兒子在外面做官，聽說一年倒也有萬多進欵，但家中没有見過他一個毫子。過去在讀書時候，整千整百的向家中要出去，但寒暑兩假在家中總得有幾個月的逗留，現在是整年的不想還來；即還來一次，也三五天就走，說甚麽公事忙碌，不能久留，這兒倒好像是做客，眞是時代變了。二兒子是遠在張家口經商，也不能常還來。三兒子雖然在家中，但整天在外面不是和朋友打牌，便是喝酒。還得家來，又是朝媳婦房中一溜，再也不來問一聲你老人家怎樣。唉，他們的年紀都大了！最少的兒子還在北京讀書，像他阿哥過去一樣，不時的寫信來要錢。講到女兒，倒也有三個，現在都已出嫁了。大女兒跟着他丈夫到湖北去當什麽局長，一年中祇來幾封信，或送一點土產，已好久不見了。二女兒因嫌嫁時　薄，不及她的妹妹，與母親生了氣，死也不肯回娘家來住一宵。小女凶家中開着舖子，得張羅家事，又有小孩，難得還來。唉，他們都飛了，祇賸下飛不去的八九個小孩還繞着你要抱要喝，和你十分親熱着，但，長大了翅膀，你們也得飛開我！一家雖有二十餘人，但我冷清清的過着寂寞的生活。誰說我比隔壁李老頭子有福氣呢？他有二個兒子，一個女兒，都住在村上，帮他種田，雖然家境差些，但一家圑聚，早晚都得見面，那才値得使人羡慕呢！唉，時代是變了。</p>

<p>在不久以前，天津各民衆圑體，因對於販運仇貨的奸商，無法可施，多組織跪哭圑，分頭出發，實行跪哭工作；爲的是要哭熱奸商的血，以期獲得一致禦侮的實效。雖然遠在天津，試閉目一想，其用心之苦，行動之没奈何，這慘味兒也彀我們受的了！</p>

<p>大陸報前天載一段新聞，大意是：「：：工部局救火處設最高瞭望台於華懋飯店頂層，用千里鏡瞭望全市，甚爲清晰，故婦女在高樓臨窗沐浴者，宜先下窗帘。：：</p>
<p>瞭望台是瞭望火警的，不是瞭望婦女沐浴的，風馬牛不相反，何必涉及婦女呢？尤其是「宜先下其窗帘」一句最使人不解。婦女臨窗沐浴，窗帘宜先下與不宜先下，决不會發生火警的，公事公辦，私事私辦，婦女沐浴是私事，瞭望火警是公事，瞭望管瞭望，沐浴自沐浴，不下窗帘，不是獻給瞭望員看的，原爲充足陽光，注重衛生起見，難道爲了個瞭望員就阻止人家的衛生不成嗎？　　似這種通告式的訓令，我以爲瞭望員或者是個風流探花，恐怕瞭望員探見了花而忘了瞭望火警，所以下此通告，並不是保重婦女人格起見，不然，　何不說男子在高樓臨窗沐浴，也宜先下窗帘呢？</p>
<p>這篇通告式的新聞，似乎還没有盡意，宜改爲「故婦在高樓臨窗沐浴更衣及ＸＸ宜先窗帘，」因爲沐浴宜先下窗帘，則更衣及ＸＸ何嘗不可呢？</p>

<h3 id="e1">"Suppressing Bandits" and "Creating Bandits" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Recently, the Communist Party's influence is increasingly rampant. From Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Sichuan to Anhui and Henan, there is a trend of prairie fire. The government authorities believe that "internal stability must precede external resistance." Therefore, after the withdrawal of Japanese troops, they mobilized a large army to conduct four encirclement and suppression campaigns. Chiang Kai-shek himself even personally set out to supervise the troops. Regarding this issue, various newspapers in the country have published commentaries, generally believing that the emergence of "bandits" is due to poor politics and economic hardship, not inherently fond of chaos. Therefore, "bandits" cannot be eradicated by suppression. What is needed is to reform politics, transform rural areas, stabilize people's livelihoods, and rectify the army, cutting off the source of "bandits." The arguments are insightful, and the words are particularly poignant. We also believe that the "bandits" throughout the country today are all created by dark politics. While politics on one hand creates "bandits," the government on the other hand suppresses "bandits." Under this contradictory behavior, "bandits" can never be eradicated by suppression, or their power may even increase with suppression. Moreover, are not those "bandits" being suppressed our hard-working compatriots? Are they not good people who are struggling to survive due to hunger and cold? Instead of aiming the guns outward, they are used to suppress people who are forced to take risks due to the dual pressures of politics and economy. Just as Yang Xingfo said, "To the Japanese troops who kill, set fires, rape, and loot, we make compromises, concede, and negotiate peace, asking them to withdraw." Yet, to the people within the country who are forced to take risks, we mobilize a large army to launch a large-scale attack. This is truly something we cannot understand.</p>
<p>The characteristic of Chinese farmers is their simplicity, perseverance, law-abiding nature, and especially their strong conservatism. No one is initially accustomed to making trouble. Moreover, the attachment to their hometowns and the love for their families, unless absolutely necessary, who would be willing to leave their hometowns, abandon their wives and children, wander in the mountains, and place their lives in the most dangerous situation? The reason for this is the pressure of politics and economy. Everyone fears death, everyone loves life. If they cannot make a living, who would willingly sit and die? To struggle for survival is human nature. Dark politics and economic hardship, if the people do not become "bandits," what other path is there? Once the people become "bandits," they can only be suppressed. Therefore, the government says "suppressing bandits," but the dark politics is actually the creator of "bandits."</p>
<p>We say this not without basis. It is because we have witnessed thousands of innocent people dying under the cruel artillery fire, and the bandit forces are rampant, which is indeed a major problem facing our country. Therefore, we cannot but speak out, and we cannot bear not to speak out.</p>
<p>On May 4th, He Yingqin said in a speech at the Jiangxi Provincial Bandit Suppression Conference: "When suppressing the Reds last year, I heard that the magistrates of Ji'an and Taihe counties arbitrarily issued self-renewal certificates, requiring civilians to pay 500 cash per month, otherwise they would be regarded as Red bandits. On the surface, although the number is not large, it is not easy for civilians to bear. When I went to Nanfeng, the same thing happened. There was also Hu Zhengyi, a member of the Ji'an County Party Committee, who extorted dozens or hundreds of yuan from the people in the name of purchasing guns and organizing a security corps. After being reported, he fled. This kind of poor politics forces good people to become bandits, which greatly affects the progress of bandit suppression."</p>
<p>In June, Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Army of Guangdong, also telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial Government, saying, "Upon investigation, in a corner of southern Jiangxi, it is cut off and falls into enemy hands. The general corrupt officials take advantage of the fact that the rulers are beyond their reach and seize the opportunity to collude with inferior scholars to do whatever they want. They exploit the people layer by layer. The people have no way to appeal, resentment accumulates day by day, and more and more people become bandits. It seems that what they do actually gives the bandits a good opportunity to incite and deceive. Their crime is no less than indirectly creating bandits."</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the supervisor Zheng Luosheng talked about Zhang Zhen's harm in Zhangzhou, he said, "The garrison troops do not engage in clearing the countryside on weekdays, but arbitrarily extort money. For example, for the deed tax, in addition to the regular tax, the garrison headquarters arbitrarily assesses the price of the people's houses, calculating 60 yuan per thousand yuan. This time, when the Communist bandits invaded Zhangzhou, they were still dozens of miles away from the city. At that time, Zhang Zhen not only did not resist out of the city, but the entire army retreated to Yunxiao and Zhao'an. People who took cars to escape were all prohibited. All the cars were completely used to transport opium and cash. Two million rounds of bullets in the city were abandoned to help the enemy. After arriving in Yunxiao and Zhao'an, they publicly sold opium in the two counties to enrich their own pockets. The state raises troops to protect the people. If the people are not protected, but are harmed, how can we comfort the people if this is not punished?"</p>
<p>The above matters are either witnessed by the bandit suppression generals or heard by the important officials of the government. All the above should be facts. If it is true, then corrupt officials and unruly troops are all creators of "bandits." To drive fish into the deep, to drive birds into the forest, how can we blame the people for becoming more and more bandits and the bandit forces for becoming more and more powerful? Moreover, as mentioned above, this is not only a phenomenon in a certain county or a certain province. It is almost the same throughout the country. Not only are the corrupt officials at the local level like this, but also the people-harming measures taken by the central government in recent years cannot avoid being a furnace for indirectly creating bandits. We will continue to elaborate on all these things.</p>

<p>Acting Principal Duan Xipeng Beaten and Injured by Students Upon Taking Office; Executive Yuan Decides to Temporarily Dissolve National Central University and Await Thorough Reorganization</p>
<p>All Students Resolve Four Demands; Zhu Jiahua Requests Resignation</p>
<p>The Process of Duan Xipeng Being Beaten</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Executive Yuan decided to appoint Duan Xipeng as the acting principal of National Central University, the students of the university were quite dissatisfied and scheduled a general assembly on the morning of the 29th to discuss countermeasures. However, at 8:00 AM this morning, Duan went to National Central University to take office. As soon as he sat down in the principal's office, the students learned about it and rushed to the principal's office to question him. When they disagreed, they beat him. Duan saw that the situation was not good and could not avoid it. His chest and other parts were injured, and his long gown was torn. The car glass was also broken. Duan immediately put on short clothes and hurriedly drove away in the car. After this incident, the government believed that the students' violent actions were a violation of the law and discipline. Unless strict rectification is carried out, it will not be enough to curb the arrogance. The Executive Yuan convened a temporary meeting. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Executive Yuan Convenes a Temporary Meeting <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan convened a temporary meeting on the morning of the 29th. Wang Zhaoming, Huang Shaoxiong, Chen Shuren, Shi Qingyang, Luo Wengan, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Shaokuan, and Chen Gongbo attended. Yu Feipeng, Zheng Tianxi, Chen Yi, Guo Chuntao, and Zeng Zhongming attended as observers. Secretary-General Chu Minyi attended. Chairman Wang Zhaoming attended. Resolutions: (1) President Wang proposed that, according to the report, at 8:30 this morning, acting principal Duan Xipeng of National Central University went to the university to take office. The students held a meeting to oppose him and led dozens of people into the principal's office, surrounding and beating acting principal Duan, who was covered in injuries. His clothes and vehicle were damaged. Acting principal Duan is now being taken to the Central Hospital, and his injuries are unclear. According to the decision of the Central Political Conference, which was handed over to the Executive Yuan for strict handling, how should it be handled?</p>
<p>Please vote on the proposal. Resolution: Strictly order the competent authorities to punish according to law. The National Central University, except for the Commercial and Medical Colleges established in Shanghai, should be temporarily dissolved and await thorough reorganization. All faculty and staff should be reappointed, and students should be re-evaluated. (2) Education Minister Zhu's request to resign from the Education Bureau was rejected and he was asked to stay. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Yuan Decree Dissolving National Central University <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan issued a Yuan decree in the afternoon, saying that on January 26 this year, the Executive Yuan decided to appoint Ren Hongjun as the president of National Central University. Later, because President Ren could not come to Beijing to take office immediately, on April 21, Liu Chenghua, Dean of the Law School, was appointed to act as the principal before President Ren arrived. He was still urged to take office as soon as possible. Recently, he repeatedly received letters and telegrams from President Ren resigning, and Dean Liu also insisted on resigning as acting principal due to business. The Yuan Yi decided on the 28th of this month that both resignations should be approved and that candidates should be sought again for consent. Before a formal selection is made, due to the approaching summer vacation, matters such as hiring teachers, academic year examinations, and recruiting new students cannot be maintained without someone for a day. Therefore, Duan Xipeng, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education, will temporarily act as the principal. According to the report, at 8:30 this morning, Acting Principal Duan went to the university to take office. The students held a meeting to oppose him and led dozens of people into the principal's office, surrounding and beating Acting Principal Duan, who was covered in injuries. His clothes and vehicle were damaged. Acting Principal Duan is now being taken to the Central Hospital, and his injuries are unclear. Such lawless and undisciplined things actually came from the students of the university. It is extremely shocking. In addition to strictly ordering the competent authorities to punish according to law, the National Central University, except for the Commercial and Medical Colleges established in Shanghai, should be temporarily dissolved and await thorough reorganization.

<h3 id="e6">Minister of Education Resigns in Disgrace <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua resigned from the Executive Yuan on the 29th. The original report said that Jiahua has little virtue and ability, and his handling is improper, resulting in the injury of Duan Xipeng, the acting principal of National Central University, who was surrounded and beaten by students this morning. The acting principal went to the university this morning to take office. Before he could speak, hundreds of students rushed to the principal's office, shouting and punching and kicking, and he was seriously injured. The representative has reported the injuries on file. In recent years, the academic atmosphere has been arrogant, and there are bad elements who are inciting and attempting to undermine the overall situation and shake the foundation of the country, like a prairie fire, which is difficult to contain suddenly. Jiahua knows that his knowledge is shallow, so after the express order was issued in late December last year, he hesitated again and again and dared not take office. Later, the national crisis became more urgent, and he had no choice but to retreat. He勉任 the difficult task, hoping for a few months, but failed to bravely retreat, which led to disaster. Continuing in this way will only increase the crime. For this reason, he requests to resign and not hinder the path of the virtuous. He sincerely asks for approval so that he can fulfill his original ambition. He is overwhelmed with anxiety and awaits orders. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After Duan Xipeng was beaten, he reported to the Executive Yuan, saying that he was ordered to be temporarily appointed as the acting principal of National Central University and to go to the university to take office immediately. He went to the university at 8:30 this morning. After arriving at the principal's office and talking with Dean Cha for a moment, the students of the university gathered from the gymnasium, made a commotion, and broke into the principal's office, strongly demanding that he go to the gymnasium to see them. He felt that the students of the university might not yet understand the government's painstaking efforts in appointing him as the acting principal, so he specially asked them to send a few representatives to see him first. Unexpectedly, before he finished speaking, some students dragged him downstairs, twisted, pulled, and beat him along the way, until outside the gate of the South Sports Institute, where they kicked him to the ground and punched and kicked him. The long shirt he was wearing was torn to pieces, and the car he was riding in was also destroyed. When the Executive Yuan decided to appoint him as the acting principal of National Central University, he believed that National Central University was the highest institution of learning in the country and that people with both virtue and prestige and rich educational experience must be carefully selected as principals. He himself examined his qualifications and dared not shoulder this great responsibility, so he repeatedly declined. Later, the Executive Yuan said that finding a candidate for principal could not be done in a moment, and now it is the summer vacation, and various school affairs need someone to be responsible for, so that they can avoid stagnation. He had no choice but to admire the Executive Yuan's utmost sincerity in maintaining National Central University and勉尽 his duties, and he also requested and was approved to temporarily maintain it for a short period to avoid trouble. Unexpectedly, when he went to the university this morning to obey the order, some students even went to such violence. He was unspeakably apprehensive because he was ordered to do something wrong.

<h3 id="e8">Zhu Jiahua's Speech <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jiahua gave a speech saying that in recent years, school turmoil has mostly been caused by a small number of bad elements. Professors with profound academic knowledge and students who study hard generally do not ask about other matters except teaching and studying, or have no opinions. Therefore, the bad elements used the fact that some people do not care about other people's business and that some people are ambivalent to carry out their activities, which led to the situation today. This time, the Executive Yuan decided to temporarily dissolve National Central University because it knew the inside story and took this resolute measure. Its intention is still to preserve the excellent elements among the students, which is undoubtedly true. National Central University is the highest institution of learning in the southeast and is in the capital, which is related to the views of the four directions. The central government must strictly rectify it and create a pure academic atmosphere so that excellent students have a place to study and study with peace of mind and will never be complacent.

I also visited many professors at National Central University, who all said that the Professors' Association was not convenient to express opinions on the students' rejection of Duan, and there was no need to hold a meeting to discuss it.

<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Dalian, the Manchurian puppet government has established a customs office on the fifth floor of the South Manchuria Railway Company building in Dalian and claims it will begin handling customs affairs from today. However, there are also widespread rumors here that the Japanese government has distributed three mediation methods to the Chinese government and the Manchurian puppet government: (1) The puppet government must not establish new customs offices in Dalian or Wafangdian. (2) The Chinese government recognizes the puppet government's management of other customs offices within Manchuria and abolishes customs duties. (3) Revoke the dismissal order of the former customs commissioner of Dalian, Fukumoto, and Japanese customs officials will also cancel their mass resignation. It is also said that Britain and France also support this method. It is now speculated that the puppet government's establishment of a separate customs office is likely an attempt by the Japanese to use it to coerce China into accepting its mediation methods.

According to the report of the Harbin Customs Commissioner, the consular body, representing twelve countries, claimed that the Japanese police advisor of the puppet government led Chinese and Russian police to point guns at the heads of Chinese officials of the Harbin Customs, attempting to force them to sign contracts, swearing allegiance to the puppet state, and remaining in the Harbin Customs to continue their service.

After discussions by the consular body, because the countries do not recognize the puppet government, they did not want to immediately lodge a formal protest to the puppet government.

<p>Frankly Demands Revision of the Treaty of Versailles</p>
<p>As the Minimum Price for Continuing Indemnity Payments</p>
<p>Betrays the British Prime Minister's Mediation Efforts</p>
<p>Lausanne Negotiations on the Verge of Collapse</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 29th – The German delegation today issued an important declaration, recounting yesterday's talks among MacDonald, Herriot, and Papen. It contained the poignant remark that only when the victorious nations eliminate the barriers in the Treaty of Versailles can the world's credit be restored. The statement claimed that the news spread by the French was misleading, alleging that Papen had explicitly stated that the restoration of peacetime industrial conditions depended entirely on the termination of the indemnity system. Therefore, the proposal for a final payment was unacceptable. It questioned how Germany, without restored equality and unresolved security, could contribute to the common effort of restructuring the world's economy.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 29th – The German delegation officially announced that German Chancellor Papen had sent a message to British Prime Minister MacDonald, stating that if Germany were to continue paying any kind of indemnity, it would be conditional on revising the discriminatory clauses in the Treaty of Versailles. The release of this message caused a great shock here, and it was widely regarded as a final, desperate appeal. Representatives from several major countries indicated that if France did not accept this condition, the conference might be suspended, and the general public also anticipated that Germany's conditions might not allow for any compromise. The message was written in German and personally delivered by Papen to MacDonald without an attached translation. It was reportedly very concise, lacking the circuitous and flowery language commonly found in diplomatic documents, and simply stated directly that Germany did not want to pay any more indemnity. However, if the Treaty of Versailles could be revised, Germany would be willing to make some concessions. The payments made should be regarded as contributions to the postwar reconstruction of European finance and economy. It directly stated that it was Germany, not France, that needed security at the moment. After the message was delivered to the British Prime Minister, a key figure in the German delegation told a reporter from the Associated Press that Germany's request for revisions to the Treaty of Versailles directly referred to its military clauses, namely the forced disarmament of Germany since the armistice. Around 10:40 this morning, German Chancellor Papen and French Prime Minister Herriot had a closed-door meeting for one hour at the Lausanne Palace Hotel.</p>
<p>After the adjournment, Papen immediately sent this message to the British Prime Minister. It was reported that the two were making a final effort to find a compromise when they began negotiations. Therefore, this message from Germany came as a complete surprise to the representatives of various countries, who did not expect Germany to take such a counterbalancing stance after France had made a strong demand. Shortly after noon, Papen left the Palace Hotel, went straight back to his residence, the Savoy Hotel, to fetch his bathing suit, and went for a swim in the lake. Although his attitude was serious, his expression was calm. Those who asked for his opinion were politely refused any comment.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 29th – In light of Germany's public statement that it would not agree to resume indemnity payments unless the treaty was revised, many anticipate that the indemnity conference might end when the six major countries hold a meeting at 5:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 28th – British Prime Minister MacDonald, French Prime Minister Herriot, and German Chancellor Papen met for three hours and forty-five minutes, but failed to break the deadlock that continues. A press release was issued after the meeting, stating that British Prime Minister MacDonald would invite representatives from the six major countries to hold another meeting tomorrow in an effort to complete the work of the conference. The so-called completion of the work of the conference is likely the conclusion of the work of the conference. Today is the thirteenth anniversary of Germany signing the treaty, and the major political figures of various countries have gathered on this day to make a final effort to resolve the indemnity deadlock. During the meeting, the German Graf Zeppelin airship slowly flew past, at a very low altitude, almost creating an atmosphere of war. If MacDonald's efforts fail to open up a new path to a quick and satisfactory solution, then this indemnity conference is unlikely to succeed. A French spokesperson released a statement, hinting at a glimmer of hope, saying that MacDonald is currently working hard to seek a compromise. However, after hearing that the private talks between the heads of government of Britain, France, and Germany had made little progress, that glimmer of hope faded again. Although the overall situation is still not very clear, it is widely felt that the British Prime Minister's repeated mediation has eased the atmosphere. Therefore, the British side at least holds a kind of calm optimism, and it is heard that the positions of France and Germany are gradually converging. The principle of abolishing the indemnity has been practically recognized by both sides, but each side wants to obtain a more detailed explanation of the other's demands. Although the British are still optimistic, the spokesperson for the French delegation stated that the German side has refused to make any concessions. Therefore, the meeting tomorrow between the heads of government and finance ministers of Germany and France is unlikely to produce results. However, the French side may have exaggerated the severity of the situation in the hope of putting pressure on the German side to make concessions. It is said that French Prime Minister Herriot stated at today's meeting that France is prepared to accept economic benefits, increased security, tariff changes, or any suggestions that the German side had previously hinted at, but the German side had not made any concrete proposals. According to French sources, Papen stated that if the political and military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles were abolished, Germany might consider paying a sum of money as an exchange condition. However, if only the indemnity were canceled, Germany could not make any payments. The German officials are currently maintaining extreme silence.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 28th – The situation in the Lausanne negotiations has often presented a view of ups and downs, changing rapidly. Today, there was another abrupt change. When the representatives were dining on the hotel balcony in the bright sunlight this morning, the thought of whether the next morning meal would be in the dining car on the way home was still in their minds. By this evening, they were all convinced that there was no need to reserve a sleeping car just yet, or that they might need to spend another week before they could eat in a train and bring home a conference result of a similar agreement, instead of returning empty-handed. Subsequent drastic changes in the situation cannot be known for certain, but at present, everyone recognizes that they have seen a glimmer of hope in the dark clouds covering the conference. Tonight, the British delegation is particularly optimistic, saying that at the latest by the beginning of next week, a solution acceptable to all parties should emerge. Today's change in the situation is due to the all-day negotiations from morning to 7:30 PM between British Prime Minister MacDonald, French Prime Minister Herriot, and German Chancellor Papen. No official information has been released about the meeting, but it is heard that although Herriot refused to concede, he had, at the advice of the British Prime Minister, temporarily shelved the French proposal to make a final payment and set a certain amount. It is also heard that Herriot has agreed to reopen direct German-French negotiations tomorrow morning. He will meet with German Chancellor Papen, while German and French finance ministers Martin and Krotschek will also discuss certain points. It is now believed that what will be discussed at that time will be the plan for the establishment of an international fund proposed by League of Nations Deputy Secretary-General Avenol. Avenol's plan is to use the international fund to repay American debts after negotiations with the United States are completed in the future, and to use this as the basis for the postwar reconstruction of Europe. The total amount of the fund and the methods of raising and using it have not yet been released.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 28th – It is now scheduled to hold a meeting of the six invited countries tomorrow afternoon. It is hoped that the situation will be fully clarified by then, so that an outline of a plan to resolve the indemnity can be presented.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 28th – Tonight, the French delegation announced that French Prime Minister Herriot and Finance Minister Martin will depart for Paris on Thursday to discuss with cabinet members and key political figures the compensation demands of France for the cancellation of the indemnity. At the same time, it also stated that the French side believes that the British side's optimism is still premature, saying that today's negotiations did not produce any practical results, but only opened a door for continued negotiations.</p>

<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 29th – At 2:00 PM today, the Japanese Army held a meeting of military councilors. Councilors Nara, Muto, Kanaya, Nan, and others attended. Army Minister Araki explained the US President Hoover's proposed one-third reduction in armaments. After discussion, Japan found it difficult to agree, and a consensus was reached.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 29th – It was learned today that the Ministry of the Navy has telegraphed naval personnel in the Japanese delegation to the disarmament conference, stating that almost all of the naval reduction methods in President Hoover's plan are opposed by the Ministry of the Navy. This method will weaken Japan's national defense and will completely stop Japan from building ships for four years, which will further increase unemployment, etc. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not yet prepared to send instructions to Japanese chief representative Matsudaira.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 28th – The British semi-official side believes that cabinet members have roughly drafted a disarmament plan yesterday. The British delegation previously proposed a motion in Geneva to find a compromise between various disarmament plans in terms of nature and quantity. The main part of the plan set by the cabinet this time is this compromise. Foreign Secretary Simon will present a summary of this plan in Geneva around the end of this week. Also, the British will ask the representatives of the British overseas self-governing territories in Geneva what their opinions are on this plan. Britain has close contact with the representatives of its territories, so there should be no problem for the territories to support the British disarmament plan.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th – The Disarmament General Committee is scheduled to meet within the next week. Today, representatives from eight countries met at the residence of the Spanish representative in Geneva to discuss the Hoover proposal. It was decided to ask the Belgian representative to ask the US delegation for details of President Hoover's so-called "police component" in the army proposal.</p>

<p>Military Controls Parliament</p>
<p>Royal Power Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 29th – The King of Siam signed the constitution proposed by the interim government today, stipulating that supreme power belongs to the people, so the monarch's power has been reduced. From now on, the supreme power will be exercised by the King, the People's Parliament, the People's Party Committee, and the courts. The monarch's orders must be countersigned by a member of the People's Party Committee. If the monarch is unwilling to approve a bill passed by the parliament, it can be returned for reconsideration, but if the monarch and the parliament still disagree, the parliament can promulgate the law separately. The parliament was initially composed of 70 military personnel representing the People's Party, but half of them will be re-elected by the people within six months. According to the new constitution, women have the right to vote. Among the important princes who are still imprisoned, only Crown Prince Purachatra remains.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Bangkok, 29th – The constitution signed by the King of Siam stipulates that the People's Party will temporarily hold dictatorial power, and complete political participation will be granted to the people only after their education level is higher and they are accustomed to self-government. As the first step in building a constitutional government, the Senate will be organized first. Half of its members will be nominated by the Executive Committee of the People's Party, and half will be directly elected by the people. However, regardless of the channel from which they are selected, each person will have one vote.</p>

<p>Externally, He Strongly Advocates Recognizing the Puppet State</p>
<p>Internally, He Pays Attention to Rural Relief</p>
<p>The Issue of Changing Local Officials Concludes</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 29th – At 10:00 AM today, Army Minister Araki, at the call of Prime Minister Saito, went to the Prime Minister's official residence to meet with Prime Minister Saito. He stated the following important opinions on the Manchurian issue and domestic and foreign policies:</p>
<p>"Foreign Relations" Manchuria has already become independent, and Japan has also decided to recognize it. Japan's position is now different from the past, and Japan's attitude towards the League of Nations should also change. However, Manchuria has already become independent, so there is no need to directly negotiate with the Nanjing government. Therefore, Japan should quickly declare Japan's attitude to China and foreign countries on this matter. "Domestic Issues" The solution to the rural problem lies in rural relief. At the same time, it is necessary to cultivate the rural areas' own resilience. Also, with regard to agricultural products, it is not enough to simply increase prices. The method of consumption of agricultural products should be considered. "Economic Issues" In the development of Manchuria, a unified controlled economy of Japan, Korea, and Manchuria should be established. The method is to first engage in industry, such as the establishment of a Manchurian industrial guidance organization by the General Staff Headquarters.</p>
<p>Electric News, Tokyo, 29th – At the cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon, which decided on the changes of local officials, Minister of the Interior Yamamoto's views differed from those of the Seiyukai cabinet members. The issue was finally resolved due to the Seiyukai's concession. The Saito cabinet is scheduled to convene the first local officials' conference in mid-July. Prime Minister Saito, Yamamoto, and others have decided to make important instructions on the current cabinet's administrative policy of advocating national unity, rural relief plans, and stabilizing people's hearts.</p>

<p>Soong Mei-ling Accompanies Him and Visits the Red Cliff While Passing Through Huangzhou</p>
<p>The Ship "Ying Rui" Fires a Salute Upon Landing in Hankou</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence – Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Banditry in the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, decided on the entire plan for the anti-banditry campaign after the Lushan Conference. At 3:00 PM on the 27th, he descended from Guling and arrived in Xunyang at 5:00 PM. At 6:00 PM, he boarded the military ship "Ying Rui" and went west, accompanied by the military ship "Yong Sui". He Chengjun, the Pacification Director, received the telegram late on the night of the 27th. Early in the morning of the 28th, He, Xia Douyin, Xu Yuanquan, Wei Lihuang, Cao Haosen, Qian Zhuolun, Lu Zuo, Lin Xiang, Chen Xizeng, Zhu Chuanjing, Yang Kuiyi, Chen Guangzu, Ye Peng, Qian Dajun, Zhang Yinxiang, Ma Dengying, Zhang Zhenhan, Rong Jingfang, Tang Enbo, Yu Jishi, Kong Geng, Li Shucheng, and others went to the riverbank to greet him. They also ordered the security battalion of the 88th Division, the security company of the Garrison Brigade, the security team of the Public Security Bureau, the Maritime Public Security Bureau, and the "Mos" planes of the 5th Aviation Squadron to be on alert. The security along the route from the port to the Commander-in-Chief's office and the Yihua Village residence was extremely tight. Chiang's itinerary was that he should arrive in Hankou at 9:00 AM on the 28th, but by 10:00 AM, no telegrams had been received from nearby areas, so a plane was dispatched, piloted by Tian Xi, to inspect the Huangzhou area. According to the report from the returned plane, the "Ying Rui" ship arrived in Huangzhou at 8:00 AM. Chiang ordered the ship to stop and disembarked with Soong Mei-ling to visit the Red Cliff, staying for about two hours. He returned to the ship at about 10:00 AM and continued to sail upstream. At 11:00 AM, he passed through Tuanfeng, and was expected to arrive in Hankou at about 3:00 PM. The Second Fleet of the Navy and the headquarters of the Pacification Headquarters also separately received wireless telegrams from the captain of the "Ying Rui" and Chiang's confidential secretaries Li Wan and Deng Wenyi, who were on the ship, stating that they would arrive in Hankou at 3:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, the "Ying Rui" ship indeed entered the port and docked in the center of the river in front of the Jianghan Customs. The "Yong Sui" followed behind and docked on the Wuchang Xujiapeng river surface. At that time, the military band on the shore played music in unison. He Chengjun, Xia Douyin, and others boarded the "Xiangyun," "Zhenyuan," and "Yuehan No. 2" small steam launches to greet him. Chiang then took a small launch ashore with Soong Mei-ling and the two sons of Kong Xiangxi. The "Ying Rui" ship fired a 19-gun salute to escort him. After Chiang landed, he took a car to the Yihua Village residence and first met with He Chengjun and Xia Douyin for a brief discussion. Chiang will schedule a separate meeting with other personnel later. That night, Chiang summoned Cao Haosen to the residence for a brief discussion and planned to convene a conversation with the generals in Hankou on the 29th. However, because the entire plan has already been determined, it will not be presented in the form of a meeting. Chiang, because he is tired of the noise, plans to move to the new campus of Wuhan University on Luojia Mountain in Wuchang to work. The headquarters will be decided to be located in Hankou. If Chiang moves to Luojia Mountain to work, then it may also be moved to Wuchang, which is uncertain. (June 28)</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Southern Section of the Ping-Han Railway is Still Chaotic <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Guangshui Tracks Repaired But Destroyed</p>
<p>Liu Zhi Leads Two Divisions South to Supervise the Suppression</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence – On the 26th of this month, bandit alerts occurred simultaneously in Lujiashan, Dongshuanghe, and Lijiazhai in the southern section of the Ping-Han Railway. On the 27th, the bandits had fled west, and the tracks near Guangshui were quickly repaired. Unexpectedly, they were destroyed again on the 28th. By the evening, they were repaired again. Repairs have not yet begun between Xindian and Liulin. On the 27th and 28th, all northbound scheduled trains went to Guangshui and turned back, and the area further north was even more chaotic. It is heard that the bandit plan was to attack Guangshan and Huangchuan unsuccessfully, so they turned to the railway. They were originally divided into three routes: one attacked Wushengguan, one attacked Lijiazhai, and one attacked Xinyang, intending to completely disrupt the transportation between Henan and Hubei. Later, because the suppression army was quickly mobilized, the bandits did not succeed and only briefly invaded Lijiazhai. Although the extent of the damage to the Ping-Han Railway has not been thoroughly investigated, it can be known that it is no less than five or six places. It is also heard that Jigong Mountain in southern Henan was also disturbed, and ten people who were there to escape the summer heat were kidnapped. Seven of them escaped, but the whereabouts of the remaining three are unknown. Fifteen employees were kidnapped. It was previously reported that five people had escaped, but this has not yet been confirmed. It is also reported that when the bandits destroyed the Ping-Han Railway, two trains were robbed near a station near Lujiashan, resulting in significant losses. The Management Committee of the Ping-Han Railway Bureau received a telegram from the section chief of the Huayuan Station stating that at 6:00 AM on the 28th, he took a handcar to Lujiashan and found that four rails had been removed at 1112 kilometers and 433 meters and discarded in the river. They could be repaired by 10:00 AM this morning. It was also found that the No. 613 locomotive of the No. 610 train and its water tank car were both between 1115 kilometers, Guangshui, and Huayuan and could be opened to traffic. However, the Lujiashan station was completely destroyed, and repairs were more difficult. According to Telegram No. 682 from the Guangshui Transportation Section, the people near Guangshui are extremely panicked. The 66-kilometer mark was destroyed again on the evening of the 27th and urgently needs military assistance. After receiving the telegram, the Road Committee telegraphed the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the Hubei Pacification Commissioner's Office, requesting that the incoming troops be ordered to provide immediate assistance to maintain transportation. At the same time, it also telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to report the current situation. The original telegram was roughly divided into four points: (1) The tracks destroyed between Shuanghe and Liulin were repaired on the 26th, and normal traffic was restored. The whereabouts of the four shackmen of 274 shacks are still unknown. (2) The Red Bandits at Lujiashan Station have withdrawn after the 13th Division sent a team to station there. Stationmaster Wang Gongchang and more than ten workers and police officers were kidnapped. The station funds were not robbed. A No. 934 guard car was burned, and many telegraph poles and tracks were cut off. The ticket office and public property were all torn down. There are reactionary slogans all over the station. (3) All the destroyed places in Lujiashan, Huayuan, Yanjiadian, and Weijiadian have been repaired by noon today. Traffic between Hankou and Guangshui has been barely restored. The 2nd Express train has been ordered to return to Hankou. (4) The fighting near Lijiazhai has stopped, and it seems to have shifted towards Xinyang. Bandit traces have been discovered again near Donghuangdian. Some bandits specializing in destruction are still lurking along the railway. Chairman Liu Zhi has been stationed in Minggang to supervise the suppression. The 13th Division under Wan Yaohuang has advanced to Lujiashan, and the 14th Army under Wei Lihuang has also advanced to Donghuangdian to jointly search and suppress the bandits. In order to prevent the bandits from fleeing elsewhere, Ma Hongkui's troops have temporarily prohibited traffic from passing through Xinyang. It will probably take another three or four days for north-south traffic to be smooth. As for the mail from Ping-Han, which could not be delivered, light mail sent to the north of Guangshui on the 26th and 27th was returned by the post office and transferred to ships to Nanjing, and then sent to the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai lines.

<p>The county government issued a notice to the public about the collection of the first phase of land tax, stating that the first phase of land price tax for the 21st year should be collected from July 1st of this year at the first and second field tax collection offices of the Finance Bureau. Branch offices will be set up in areas far from the city to facilitate tax payment for grain households. For the disaster arrears in each district of the 20th year, permission has been granted for exemption and general reduction. All silver dollars overpaid that year should be allowed to be deducted separately from each map of the first phase of land price tax of this year. The original 5 cents of silver per mu for the security map expenses levied with the 38 insurance maps should be temporarily allowed to continue to be levied for one year this year and should still be ordered to be levied in separate books by the cabinet. The amount of silver to be levied should be checked according to the number listed on the notification form for simple viewing, and tax preparation should be self-sealed and submitted to the cabinet for completion, with August 31st as the deadline, and penalties will be imposed according to regulations if the deadline is exceeded.</p>
<p>The Education Committee of the First District Was Abolished – The county Education Bureau previously received an order from the Education Department to issue revised organization regulations and classification standards and expense expenditure forms for county Education Bureaus and immediately complied with the order. After receiving the order, Director Zhu examined the existing funds in the county and found that the number of education committee members could only be four, and there were six school districts, so two districts should be merged. However, because the county is a merger of the Hua and Lou counties, and the land is vast, if the school districts are merged immediately, obstacles are inevitable in practice. Therefore, it is proposed that the school districts remain the same for the time being, but one education committee member will be reduced. The duties of the education committee member of the first school district in the suburban areas of the city will be handled by the education committee members of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts, who will make nearby inspections of the schools in the first school district when they return to the city to be stationed in the bureau during inspection intervals. The administrative affairs of the district will be handled concurrently by the county superintendent, so that the business will not be abandoned and the instructions of the Education Department to tighten the budget will still be followed. It has been submitted to the Education Department for approval and transfer for implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Swire's Yangtze River Steamer Wanliu Sinks After Hitting Reef <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Losses Reach 600,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Only the Smokestack Remains Visible Above Water</p>
<p>Passengers and Crew Rescued</p>
<p>Commercial ship accidents have been frequent lately, with collisions and fires occurring one after another. After the Swire Company's Shengjing steamer was rescued from danger in Weihaiwei, the Wanliu steamer on the upper Yangtze River sank after hitting a reef. A reporter has investigated various sources and compiled the following report.</p>
<p>Cause of the Accident: Swire Company's Yangtze River upstream steamers are divided into large ships and shallow-draft vessels. There are three large ships: Wanxian, Wanliu, and Wantong. Each of these ships has a capacity of over 1,100 tons and operates annually after the Yangtze River floods. This year, all three ships were operating on the Sichuan River, traveling between Yichang and Chongqing. On this occasion, the Wanliu was transporting passengers and cargo from Chongqing to Wanxian and Yichang before heading to Shanghai. The river water was high. As the ship passed through the Huangjiapo river surface, approximately 140 to 150 miles from Chongqing, it strayed from the channel and entered a cluster of submerged reefs. The ship suddenly struck a reef, with its bow hitting the reef first, immediately causing a rupture.</p>
<p>Engine Damage: When the Wanliu struck the reef, the front of the ship was impaled. The bottom of the front hold was severely scraped by the reef, causing it to rupture. The middle hold, which housed the engine room, was the main part of the ship. When it was breached by the reef, river water rushed into the ship. Within moments, the water level in the front hold rose to eight feet. The engine room was also flooded within an hour, with the water reaching nine feet. The furnace in the engine room was extinguished by the water, plunging the ship into darkness and rendering it immobile. Fortunately, the hull was supported by the reef; otherwise, it would have sunk immediately.</p>
<p>Rescue of Crew and Passengers: When the ship struck the reef, the passengers were panicked and mindful of the Qijiang and Yiling ships sinking in the Yangduxi incident. Fearing the ship would sink in a minute, they rushed to the deck to escape. Fortunately, the captain and others reassured them that the ship was grounded on the reef and would not sink immediately. The passengers calmed down. The captain sent out distress signals and fired flares. Soon, many privately-owned wooden boats passed by and responded to the calls for help. The passengers were first transported to the private boats via sampans and gradually transported to Yichang. Subsequently, Swire in Chongqing received the telegram about the Wanliu accident and sent the Wanxian and other ships to help. Therefore, all crew and passengers were unharmed and safely arrived in Yichang.</p>
<p>Sinking of the Vessel: After the ship ran aground, the hull was severely damaged, and it gradually sank because of the heavy load. Luckily, the reef supported the vessel, so the sinking was somewhat slowed. Although the ship remains on the reef, the first two, three, and four holds are completely flooded. Currently, the water has submerged the third deck, leaving only the smokestack and ventilators visible above the water. The company is unable to salvage the ship now, as it must wait for the water level to drop in winter before attempting salvage operations.</p>
<p>Estimated Losses: The ship was one of Swire's first-class upper Yangtze River vessels, with a capacity of 1,180 tons. It was purchased from Longmao Foreign Firm in Shanghai as the Longmao wheel, and renamed the current name. The hull was built in the Jiangnan Shipyard, and the engine components were of excellent quality. The ship cost 400,000 yuan at the time of construction. In addition, the ship was carrying a large amount of cargo, including medicinal herbs and silk, which was all trapped in the ship. The loss of the cargo, as well as the luggage and money of the crew and passengers, is estimated to be at least 600,000 yuan. The company is planning to salvage the cargo from the holds that can be unloaded.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Disappearance of Russian <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Confirmed Dead in Detention Center Due to Illness</p>
<p>Offer to Open Coffin for Examination</p>
<p>The case of the disappearance of Russian Gletzki from the Second Special District Court Prison has been heavily publicized by local Western newspapers, with some suggesting that it is a second Tafeng case. To clarify the truth, a reporter from this newspaper visited Ying Shi, the president of the Second Special District Court, yesterday. The reporter learned that the Western newspaper's report was untrue. According to the Second Special District Court Detention Center, a Russian named George Latakiaev died in the detention center on the 19th of this month at 11:40 AM due to illness. The Russian mentioned in the Western newspaper, Gletzki, does not exist. It is assumed that he is a misspelling of Latakiaev. The Russian had no home or job in Shanghai and begged for food on the streets. On the afternoon of the 16th of this month at 7:30 PM, he was found drunk and lying on vacant land near Bushi Road by the French Concession Deputy Constable Victoria. Victoria took him to the police station. The next day, the police department sent him to the Second Special District Court, accusing him of violating Article 25 of the Road Administration Regulations. The court sentenced him to two days of detention for drunkenness and five days of detention for extortion, for a total of seven days of detention. He was sent to the detention center, where he was already vomiting, appearing to have cholera. He was also gaunt and frail. After being detained in the detention center, he continued to vomit. The detention center's forensic doctor prescribed him medicines such as Ten Drops Water and Pingan Water, but they were ineffective. On the morning of the 19th at 11:40 AM, he died of illness. Prosecutor Wu Xiaoke and forensic doctor Wei Ligong conducted an autopsy and turned the body over to the Tongren Fuyuantang funeral home for burial. All of this is documented. The court denied the claim that the Russian was beaten to death by prison guards in the detention center. They declared that if foreigners still had suspicions, they could open the coffin for examination to see if there were any injuries, so that the truth of the case could be revealed. A letter from the Jiangsu-Shanghai Second Special District Prison stated: "Dear Sir, we read in your paper on the 29th of this month a report from the Da Mei Evening News about the disappearance of Russian Gletzki in prison. We were shocked. After checking, this prison has not received any Russian prisoners under the name of Gletzki since its establishment. No foreign prisoners have died or disappeared. This is purely fabricated. We are deeply concerned that the rumors are false and request that your newspaper make a correction. Sincerely, Jiangsu-Shanghai Second Special District Prison, June 29th."</p>
<p>A letter from the Jiangsu-Shanghai Second Special District Court Clerk's Office stated: "Dear Sir, we read a news item in the Da Mei Evening News stating that a Russian newspaper staff member, Glacken, disappeared from the jail of the Second Special District Court in the French Concession. Some people saw him bleeding, and it is suspected that he was beaten in the chest. We were shocked. After checking, this court's detention center has not held any prisoners named Glacken. It is possible that it is a mistake for the Russian Georgi Latakiaev. The prisoner was found drunk on the ground on the evening of the 16th of this month, violating police regulations. The French Concession Police Department sent him to this court for trial on the 17th. The interrogation revealed that the prisoner was homeless and lived by begging. The charge of being drunk and lying on the ground was true. He was immediately sentenced to seven days of detention and sent to this court's detention center. The prisoner had already contracted a serious illness outside and was weak and emaciated when he entered the prison. He vomited and had diarrhea. The prison doctor examined him and determined that he had contracted an epidemic. He was given medicine, but it did not improve. Just as he was about to be transferred to a hospital for treatment, he died in the prison at 11:40 AM on the morning of the 19th. The office prepared a document and reported it to the prosecutor's office of this court. The prosecutor's office sent Prosecutor Wu Xiaoke and forensic doctor Wei Ligong to the prison for inspection. The inspection confirmed that he died of illness and there was no other reason. Shanghai Tongren Fuyuantang was ordered to provide coffins and bury him. There are files and certificates to prove this. The Jiangsu-Shanghai Second Special District Prison is directly under the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After inquiries with the prison, it was found that there was no such incident. The above news is obviously fabricated out of thin air. In addition to sending a letter to the newspaper requesting a correction and investigation, we hope that you will check and make a correction. Sincerely, Jiangsu-Shanghai Second Special District Court Clerk's Office, June 29th."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Western Newspaper Reports on the Atrocities of the Japanese Army in Northeast China <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>German Priest Lai Pu Tragically Murdered: The Zi Lin Bao (North China Daily News) published details yesterday regarding the murder of German Priest Lai Pu near Longjing Village on the Manchu-Korean border. The details were obtained from reliable sources stating that after Priest Lai was taken away by Japanese soldiers, he never returned. His body was later found buried in the ground nearby, covered with wounds and with broken limbs. This incident shows the atrocities of the Japanese in Northeast China. On June 5th, a German priest died of typhus in Tai Ye Tang (transliteration). The archbishop sent a priest to the nearby Japanese police station to call the Japanese Consulate in Yanji, asking them to inform Priest Lai Pu in Longjing Village to take care of the matter. That afternoon, Priest Lai Pu took a light train to Laotougou. He arrived in the evening and met several priests and parishioners from Yanji who also wanted to go to Tai Ye Tang. Because it was late and raining, they decided to stay overnight and leave the next day. However, Priest Lai Pu was eager to attend the funeral, so he ignored the advice and took a horse sent by Tai Ye Tang to pick him up, braving the rain. When he arrived in Enhasi (transliteration), it was already 9:00 PM. There was a Japanese garrison there. The Korean translator sent by Tai Ye Tang was standing next to the Japanese sentry, waiting. As soon as Lai arrived, the Japanese sentry said to the Korean translator, "What kind of pig is this? Tell him to dismount immediately." Lai replied that he was completely soaked and wanted to go to Tai Ye Tang, and handed him his business card. The sentry shouted, "Do you know that no one dares to hand a business card to a Japanese soldier while on horseback?" Then the two sentries began to scold him. The other soldiers in the garrison came out after hearing the noise, and they were all drunk. Then a Japanese military policeman came and shouted, "What's going on?" When he saw Priest Lai Pu, he said, "Get off your horse!" Lai obeyed and dismounted. The Japanese military policeman immediately slapped him in the face. The other Japanese soldiers surrounded Lai, dispersed the crowd, and severely beat the Korean translator until he was covered in blood. They then took Lai to the garrison. The Korean translator could only faintly hear the sounds of beatings outside, and then heard a scream. He ran back to Tai Ye Tang and reported to the archbishop that the Japanese were going to kill Priest Lai Pu. The archbishop immediately took two priests to rescue him. They rushed to the riverbank and heard three gunshots, followed by a fourth. They suspected that they were being shot at and had to turn back. A Korean in Enhasi (transliteration) heard the sound of horses' hooves and people's voices, and looked out the door. He saw a man leading a horse, with three Japanese soldiers on the side and three Japanese soldiers behind. The Korean asked, "Are you Priest Lai Pu?" The man leading the horse replied, "Yes, I am Lai Pu." Before he finished speaking, a Japanese soldier rushed towards the Korean, who dodged into the room. A few minutes later, he heard three gunshots, followed by another. The Korean changed into black clothes and went out, and saw the Japanese soldiers returning alone. He did not see Priest Lai Pu. Knowing that something was wrong, he secretly went to the riverbank with a friend to search. They found Lai Pu's body lying face down in a pool of blood. They took off his outer clothing and took it to the Tai Ye Tang Church to report. The church servant told him not to disturb the archbishop for the time being. He was only able to see the archbishop at 4:00 AM and tell him what had happened. The archbishop immediately sent a priest with him to Enhasi. They first went to the pool of blood and saw that Lai Pu's body was no longer there, but there was still blood. They found four bullets. The priest then went alone to the Japanese garrison in Enhasi and saw the Korean translator hired by the Japanese army. He asked if he had seen Priest Lai Pu. The translator replied that he had. The priest asked where he was. The translator said, "He is here. The Japanese soldiers beat him, but the injuries were not fatal. I told the Japanese soldiers that he was a priest and should be released immediately." The priest asked if he had been released. The translator said yes. The priest asked where he was. The translator said that he had gone to Hengsheng Laizi (transliteration). The priest said, "That's strange. Why did he go there?" The translator said, "That road is very dangerous, and something might happen to him." The priest then returned. Later, he saw a horse abandoned in the wilderness, with wounds on its body. Two days later, a Korean saw footprints in the sand and followed them. He found Priest Lai Pu's body buried in shallow soil. He examined the body and saw that there were stab wounds and club wounds on the skull, the nose was broken, the flesh of the nose was cut into three pieces, there was a bullet wound in the heart, and a bullet wound in the abdomen, both of which had passed through. One arm was almost dislocated, and one arm was broken. There were a total of thirty-five stab wounds on the chest, abdomen, back, and thighs. It was truly tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e117">A Record of the Sanmen Bay Inspection (1) <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Departure from Shanghai and Inspection Along the Way</p>
<p>The History of the Dongmen Island Lighthouse</p>
<p>Sanmen Bay in eastern Zhejiang is one of China's famous good harbors. In 1929, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sought permission from the central government to open a self-governed commercial port. The central government and the Zhejiang provincial government commissioned a committee to survey and determine the areas for administration, commerce, agriculture, salt production, and residential areas throughout the bay. A preliminary plan was prepared. Overseas Chinese in various places felt a great interest in the construction of Sanmen Bay. They organized the Sanmen Bay Overseas Chinese Construction Committee to actively engage in construction, cooperating with the government using the power of the masses. On September 24th of last year, the committee gathered representatives from all walks of life and went to Sanmen Bay for the first on-site inspection. On June 24th, the committee's representatives launched a second inspection, departing from Shanghai, passing through Dinghai and Shipu, and arriving at Sanmen Bay. They returned to Shanghai on the 29th. This newspaper reporter also participated in this mission and will record the findings below. It is hoped that patriots in the country will hear about it and raise funds together so that the mission of the first major port in the East can be achieved soon.</p>
<p>Organization of the Inspection Group: The Sanmen Bay Overseas Chinese Construction Committee was the main body of the inspection group. It also hired American engineer Warner, a road construction engineer from Kai Dui Pi La, and Liu Zhongchang, a mechanical and electrical engineer from Lihe Foreign Firm, to inspect road and dam construction projects throughout the bay. The inspection group consisted of eleven people, including representatives from the Sanmen Bay Overseas Chinese Construction Committee: Zhou Nai Weng, Hu Changying, Zhou Liuting, Chen Xinyuan, Li Jingru; Yu Lianpin, director of the Hangzhou Radio Station; Yang Zhuoqun, representative of Tongyixiang Silk Factory; Wu Weimin, representative of Huayuan Tongsheng Silk Weaving Factory; American engineer Warner; Chinese engineer Liu Zhongchang; and this newspaper reporter Qian Hua. It was reported that more than ten representatives from the Zhejiang Provincial Government and various sectors were also planning to attend, but due to the urgency of time, they were unable to do so. Wang Wenhan, director of the Zhejiang Outer Sea Water Police Bureau, sent a Tai'an warship, which waited in Shipu, to transport the inspection group to Sanmen Bay for their safety.</p>
<p>Shanghai to Sanmen Bay: From Shanghai to Sanmen Bay, it takes 18 hours by boat. The six boats that dock at the 16th Pier every week, including the Zhoushan, Chuanshan, Dahua, Daxing, Taizhou, and Deli, can all pass through Dinghai and arrive at Shipu, the entrance to Sanmen Bay. Then, passengers change to Yongpu and Linpu launches to inspect the port area of Haiyou Port in Sanmen Bay. The inspection group departed from the 16th Pier on the Daxing boat at 5:00 PM on the 24th of this month and arrived at Dinghai at 4:00 AM the next morning. Dinghai, commonly known as Zhoushan, is the largest island in eastern Zhejiang. It is surrounded by the sea and not connected to the mainland. Most of the residents are engaged in fishing and salt production, and the market is thriving. The scenery is particularly beautiful, with green mountains and blue waters, like a painting. Nearby small islands are scattered like stars, surrounded by mountains, forming a natural barrier. It is said that Zhoushan has sixteen layers of gates, which shows the excellence of its terrain. The whole group went ashore to sightsee, walking hundreds of steps to climb the Dongyue Temple on the top of Dongyue Mountain, overlooking the entire city. They then returned to the city, circled around it, and returned to the boat. At 7:00 AM, the Daxing boat left the port and headed south to Shipu Town, the entrance to Sanmen Bay. The boat traveled between the islands and mountains, winding and turning. Looking out from the boat, one felt like an immortal. According to navigators, the inland sea route from Dinghai is dangerous, with reefs everywhere and rapid currents. The slightest carelessness can lead to collisions and capsizing. At 10:30 AM, the boat reached Tongwamen, the gateway to Shipu. Looking from afar, the mountains connect to form a straight line. At first glance, it seems that the waterway is blocked and impassable. But as the boat approached the foot of the mountain, a line of waterway was revealed, which was truly a natural barrier. After entering Tongwamen, Shipu Pier was reached in half an hour. Although Shipu is a small town, it is a necessary stop for navigation in eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, the market is bustling, and the residents are prosperous. It has electric lights and radio equipment. The houses on the hillside are densely arranged. Climbing the steps, one has a different view. At this time, the Taian warship was anchored in the river. Captain Sun Xianhe came to greet them. At 10:00 PM on the 25th, the whole group boarded the ship to rest. At 2:00 AM on the 26th, they weighed anchor and set sail for Sanmen Bay.</p>
<p>The Lighthouse on Dongmen Island: Reefs are common in the inland seas of eastern Zhejiang, which navigators consider a dangerous route. The region lacks lighthouses at crucial places, which has resulted in frequent shipwrecks. Brothers Ren Xiaohe and Ren Xiaofu from Shipu, who have personal experience of this issue, demolished their home in 1914 to build a lighthouse on Dongmen Island near Shipu. They used their monthly income from fishing to cover the lighthouse's operational expenses and their remaining funds for construction and expansion. In recent years, the lighthouse's architecture has been completely renovated, costing more than 10,000 yuan. They built seven residential buildings next to the tower, where the brothers live year-round. Since the establishment of the lighthouse, ships have been able to pass through safely without incident.</p>

<p>The villagers admired his righteousness, so they erected a monument next to the tower. He always said that running the lighthouse was difficult. After the inspection team arrived in Shipu, they hired a small boat at 3 pm that afternoon to visit the Dongmen Island Lighthouse. Mr. Ren Xiaofu warmly greeted them. Mr. Ren, with a benevolent face, said that he was already fifty-four years old, and his brother was fifty-seven. He had studied in a private school for three years. Building the lighthouse was for the benefit of others in the fishing industry. He and his brother had been fishermen since they were young and were not from a wealthy family. All that they had earned from decades of hard work was invested in this. They currently had two large fishing boats, and the monthly profit of over one hundred yuan was just enough to cover the expenses of the lighthouse. However, his brothers were getting old and weak, and after their death, the lighthouse would eventually have no means of support. Therefore, they were trying to figure out how to purchase farmland as a permanent fund. He did not know when this wish could be fulfilled, and he was always worried about it. His spirit of sacrificing for public good was enough to shame the officials of today. The residence next to the tower, although extremely simple, was elegantly arranged, with flowers and trees filling the garden, and fragrance overflowing. The sea breeze blew, making one feel refreshed, almost as if one were on a fairy island. It was said that a local gentleman had petitioned the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Ren family, requesting subsidies. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China (1930), the Zhejiang Customs had allocated a one-time subsidy of one thousand five hundred yuan, but thereafter, it was stopped due to the national financial difficulties. Although it rained heavily that day, the interest of the visitors was increased by Mr. Ren’s righteousness. The monument next to the tower was inscribed by the famous Huangyan calligrapher Yu Changlin. The inscription read: "Dongmen Island stands tall in the sea, serving as a shield for Xiangshan Shipu. It is the Tianmen Mountain mentioned in old gazetteers. The Changguo Guard City was established here in the Tang Dynasty. The islands are scattered, with the Tongwamen port to the north and the Laodongmen port to the south. It is an important passage for the Sanmen Bay route. Whenever there is fog at night, the harbor entrance is indistinguishable, and ships passing by are in danger, making it a dreaded route. In the spring of the year Yimao (1915), the islanders Ren Xiaohe and Xiaofu brothers raised money to build a lighthouse on the southeast of the island to guide the route, thus celebrating peace. In the autumn of the year Jiwei (1919), due to carelessness, the tower was destroyed. The Xiaohe brothers, together with Ji Junzhuan, Chang Deng, and others, raised funds to expand the three-story lighthouse and build seven houses next to the tower as a place for the lamp operator to live. The kitchen was fully equipped, and the construction was solid and durable, costing over ten thousand yuan in total, sacrificing their homes to do good deeds. From then on, the sea waves no longer caused fear, and merchants sang praises. The benevolent and righteous spirit of the Ren brothers is immortal along with this tower, without end for billions of years. Changlin is also from Zhejiang, sharing in the celebration, so he wrote this record to inform those who come later and pass it on to future generations. Written by Yu Lin of Huangyan in the first month of autumn in the year Jiazi (1924)."</p>

<h3 id="e126">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Strives to Stop Jiangsu Special Business Tax <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>If the Central Government Cannot Sanction Illegal Acts</p>
<p>It Has Already Abandoned Its Clear Decree to Abolish Li Taxes</p>
<p>Since hearing the news that the Jiangsu Provincial Government planned to implement a special business consumption tax, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the request of various industry guilds, has repeatedly submitted to the Executive Yuan, requesting its cancellation in order to uphold the law. However, although the Executive Yuan has issued an order to cancel it, the Jiangsu Provincial Government still intends to illegally collect it from July 1st. The Chamber of Commerce yesterday again submitted letters from the seven industries and telegraphed the Executive Yuan to effectively stop it. The telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Title omitted) It is noted that the source of tax revenue to offset the abolition of Li taxes belongs to the Central Government as consolidated tax and to the local government as business tax. The boundaries have long been determined. The Jiangsu Province’s Li tax was assigned to the Central Government as early as after Minister Song took over the Ministry of Finance, and the Ding and Cao taxes, which had always been national taxes, were allocated back to Jiangsu Province. The gains and losses were sufficient to offset each other, so the abolition of the Li tax can be said to have caused no significant loss in Jiangsu Province. The actual amount of loss to the Provincial Government is only the surtax of 20% added to the account (which continues to be collected and retained for provincial use even after the account is closed). In terms of numbers, it is definitely not too large. If the business tax is managed properly, it should not be insufficient to offset it. The Province’s tax revenue deficit is partly due to the excessive collection costs at the beginning of the business tax and partly due to the impact of the situation, which has prevented business from improving, resulting in sluggish tax revenue. The situation is just like the reduction or exemption of Ding and Cao taxes due to poor harvest, which is the same in principle. When the state encounters a year of poor harvest of fields, it can only reduce or exempt taxes according to precedent, and there is no other way to extract from farmers. In the same way, there is no reason to change the name and take compensation from merchants due to the poor collection of business tax. This is on the political system. Furthermore, the business tax law was decided by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government. The tax laws and collection methods are all stipulated. The Province, knowing that it has no basis, does not hesitate to create a special business tax name to confront it. This measure has long exceeded the scope of the law. If the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which is close to the capital, does not hesitate to disregard the clear decree to abolish the Li tax, how can the central government's decrees be implemented nationwide in the future? The shortage of treasury funds is not unique to Jiangsu Province. Other provinces may have ten or hundreds of times more. Abandoning the political system and disregarding the law due to lack of funds means there is no day for political integrity. This is why Confucianism talks about politics; they say that one should rather give up food than give up faith. Recently, business sentiment in Jiangsu Province has been agitated to the extreme, and they say that if the Central Government cannot sanction the illegal acts of Jiangsu Province, the Central Government has already abandoned its clear decree to abolish the Li tax. The so-called offsetting the abolition of the Li tax has lost its basis for existence. There is only the suspension of the consolidated tax and business tax. I am afraid that a great disturbance will be unstoppable once it starts, adding to the government's anxieties. Therefore, I do not avoid being troubles煩 and offer my sincere opinion. I respectfully request the President to effectively stop the special business tax in Jiangsu Province for the sake of public convenience. Shanghais Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows in investigation.</p>

<p>To the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry of the Nanjing National Government: Jiangxi Province has suffered from exploitation by warlords, all industries are devastated, and the people cannot bear their fate. The communists took advantage of this to rise up. By the time the communists rose up, the rural areas, on which the entire province depended as its economic foundation, and the old handicraft industry had been destroyed. The number of unemployed people increased, and the communist forces became more rampant and uncontrollable. Today, to plan the suppression of the communists, military force is indeed a last resort to treat the symptoms. However, implementing a tight fiscal policy, reducing and exempting taxes, encouraging domestic goods, and revitalizing the rural economy to cut off the source of the communists is even more urgent for treating the root cause. However, the Jiangxi Provincial Government, under the guise of the Provincial剿匪 Conference, illegally passed a production and sales tax case and recently decided to implement the tax from July 1st. It is investigated that increasing the burden on the people must be decided in principle by the Central Political Conference and passed by the Legislative Yuan. The Jiangxi Provincial Government violated the law and collected the tax without authorization. This kind of transformed Li tax not only clearly violates the Central Government's original intention to abolish the Li tax, but also makes no sense in terms of clearing the aftermath of the disaster. It is like adding fuel to the fire or trying to stop boiling water by pouring it out. Even if it is used entirely for the aftermath, it is not desirable for those who are knowledgeable. Moreover, it is heard that it will be used to expand the security forces. It is not known that the trouble in Jiangxi today is precisely the large number of soldiers without precision. With more than 200,000 troops, it has not been possible to clear more than 100,000 bandits after two or three years of long years. To say that by adding and training several security teams in a short period of time will be enough to achieve the superficial work of clearing the bandits is not something anyone believes. The result is nothing more than adding an unbearable burden to 30 million people, cutting off their only chance of survival, and creating opportunities for the communists. Clearing the bandits is suitable for creating bandits. The consequences may be unimaginable today. Furthermore, changing administrative regions is the special right of the Central Government. Now, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has arbitrarily added so-called thirteen district administrative chiefs on top of the eighty-one counties, increasing the provincial treasury expenditure by more than 300,000 yuan per year. This is not only increasing the burden on the people, but also destroying the law and self-control, seemingly like independence. The暴日 have repeatedly used the excuse that our country has no organization to carry out its aggression. What excuses will we use to defend ourselves now? It is thought that the Central Government will not sit idly by in the face of such acts of undermining unity, violating the law, and harming the people, even if no one calls for it. Jie Min and others are deeply concerned about their homeland and are eager to show their sincerity. They are deeply afraid that the Central Government’s views and news may not be comprehensive, so they do not avoid suspicion and resentment and express their sincere opinions. They respectfully request that a clear order be issued to strictly prohibit it. Jiangxi is fortunate, and the party and the country are fortunate.

<h3 id="e128">Record of the General Assembly of the Silk Factory Trade Association <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Unable to Operate Due to Increased Burdens. The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association held its 13th Temporary Representative Assembly of the First Session at 3 p.m. yesterday (29th). More than 70 people, including representatives of various silk factories and standing committee members Zhu Jingan and Zhang Peishen, were present. The meeting was held as usual. First, Chairman Shen Chen reported on the association's work process and cases: (1) Since the last meeting, the association has handled a total of 186 documents. (2) Changes in the number of representatives of the association attending the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. (3) Payment of the municipal chamber of commerce membership fees. (4) The Industrial Department organized and reorganized the Jiangsu-Zhejiang陳 Factory Silk and陳繭 Committee. (5) Shanghai Hengtaixiang Exchange Bank went bankrupt. If any industry has匯兌 款 owed by the bank, they must find a guarantor to collect the款 from the association before July 15. If any industry is involved, please pay attention. After the report, three important cases were discussed: (1) A discussion on the strike that occurred in various silk factories in the Hongkou District due to wage issues. The consensus was that this strike and the demands for improved treatment were not the true intentions of the labor union, but were caused by incitement from a third party. The truth is not only understood by the industry, but also by the party and government agencies and labor unions. However, the silk industry is related to industry and commerce and should take into account all three aspects. Judging from the current cost, this year's new繭 from Zhejiang Province has the highest cost, requiring 530 taels per dan of silk, and at least 400 taels. Jiangsu Province requires a maximum of 450 taels and a minimum of 390 taels. Adding in the silk reeling and female worker wages of 42 cents per work, the cost of each dan of silk is about 550 taels to 650 taels. According to the current market, the price of foreign silk is only over 500 taels, and the factory is still losing more than 100 taels, and there is no real transaction. It is investigated that most of the factories currently in operation are reeling陳繭 for押欵 (the cost of陳繭 is over 1,000 taels, and the loss is even greater). Only a few are reeling new繭, purely to maintain the livelihoods of the workers, and there is no profit to be made. If they want to continue to support it, the factories are already finding it difficult. However, according to this year's繭 price, farmers and sericulturists will also go bankrupt. If we abandon the difficulties of farmers and merchants and only seek to increase wages, then the international trade of raw silk will only lead to its extinction. The consensus of the industry is that it is already a great fortune if they can maintain the status quo and work hard. If they increase the burden again, the industry will be unable to continue operating. Then, Zhang Peishen, the director of the Hongkou District Silk Factory Association, stood up and reported that since the strike occurred in the Hongkou District Silk Factory, the workers of each factory had met several times. They were very shocked that the request to restore the original treatment was being published in the name of others. The workers knew the factory's difficulties very well. The factories currently in operation are for the sake of maintaining the workers' livelihoods and were started after the workers and management reached an understanding in advance. This labor unrest was clearly caused by others stirring up trouble, and the workers had no demands at all. The workers of each silk factory have elected representatives, including Xiang Cheng, Shen Shaoqin, Yi Chang, Tan Yongyuan, Cheng Wangziqing, Tong Wei, Ye Qiutao, Yu Jing, Ding Guanfang, Yi Feng, Wei Kun, Wang Yuanfeng, Ren Ji, Yin Jianqing, Xing Lun, Xu Chunqiao, Wei Yu, Cha Wenqiao, and Song Ziqiao, to sign a statement of fact and declare that the wage cannot be increased any further to maintain the status quo. (2) A discussion on the issue of the association's collection of this year's membership fees. Chairman Shen said that the association has always collected the Fuyin business fee for each district, which is one yuan per car, and the association's membership fee is 50 cents. Now, there are few factories in operation, and the revenue is not enough to handle welfare matters, so they have temporarily suspended collection. The association's membership fee is related to regular expenses and is planned to be collected in two installments, totaling 50 cents, to cover office expenses. It was resolved to do so. (3) A discussion on the letter from the Shanghai National Crisis Savings Association Preparatory Office, reporting on the progress of the preparations and requesting the election of representatives. It was resolved to wait until the next public recommendation. After the discussion, just as the meeting was about to adjourn, two female worker representatives came to the meeting and reported to Chairman Shen that several factories in the Zhabei District had been affected by labor unrest. Chairman Shen comforted the two representatives and promised to investigate and verify. By the time the meeting adjourned, it was already 7 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Pudong Organizations Send Letter to Lu Bohong <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of Zhu Shaoqi, the Pudong fellow-villagers association and the Pudong public office, among other organizations, stated that the China Merchants Electric Company had previously dismissed oil vendors, inciting a strike by some workers who posted slogans insulting the head of the transportation department, Zhu Shaoqi. The manager of the company, Lu Bohong, has not yet made a formal resolution or statement. Furthermore, since Zhu is known for his excellent character, they sent a letter to Lu requesting him to find a proper solution as soon as possible. The original letter is as follows: "Respectfully, we were deeply shocked to see slogans openly insulting the head of the transportation department, Zhu Shaoqi, posted on the streetcars operated by your company. The people of our hometown know Zhu’s character well, and he has served in Shanghai for decades. The gentlemen and merchants all praise him. It cannot be damaged by adversity. However, during the outbreak of the strike at your company, we did not initially understand the truth. We saw Zhu report to the board of directors and disclose the facts of the entire incident. It is his duty to investigate the details of the ticket sales fraud. The decision to dismiss them after the report is the special prerogative of your manager. Moreover, you were cautious and thorough, first ordering the head of the lighting department, your younger brother Zhonglin, to re-examine and confirm the facts before issuing a resolute decision. This is different from relying solely on Zhu’s report. The workers are criticizing Zhu to vent their anger. You have not made a formal resolution, causing harm to the company. The future of your company is worrying. For the sake of Zhu’s reputation and the future of your company, we ask you to find a proper solution as soon as possible and announce it to the public to dispel doubts. We earnestly hope that you will consider this carefully and reply. This is addressed to Mr. Lu Bohong, Manager of the Shanghai China Merchants Electric Company. Jointly launched by the Pudong Compatriots Association and the Pudong Public Office, June 27th."</p>
<h3 id="e130">Eight Groups Oppose Special Business Tax <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>If It Is Levied, We Can Only Give Up Our Business</p>
<p>We Will Not Stop Until We Achieve the Goal of Abolishing It</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai 　 餅業 Trade Association, in order to oppose the Jiangsu Provincial Government's implementation of the special business tax, convened a joint meeting of eight trade groups, including the bean and rice industry, the oil mill industry, the Han Gang Zhi Cheng Public Office, the Guang Gang Shen Shou Tang and the Public Office, the Sanshan Guild Hall, and the Quanzhang Guild Hall. Cai Yukun chaired the meeting and reported that the purpose of inviting the various trade groups to attend the meeting today was that the Jiangsu Provincial Government's special business tax, which was decided to be implemented on July 1, would be collected at bureaus set up on key roads on land and water. The tax is collected on goods, which is harsher than the Li tax. Once this end is opened, the provincial governments will follow suit, and the merchants of Shanghai will be cut off at will. How can we bear this? The deadline for implementation is approaching. It is hoped that the fellow traders who attend the meeting will quickly come up with countermeasures. The fellow traders were filled with indignation and said that they would never recognize this illegal tax. If they were determined to levy it and wanted to put the merchants to death, they would have to suspend operations and resist until they achieved the goal of abolishing it. It was publicly decided that the Jiangsu Provincial Government, disregarding the merchants' difficulties, had decided to implement it on July 1. Since things had come to this point, the members of the association had no choice but to suspend operations in unison and spare no effort to make any sacrifices. As for the letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce asking the association how it would express its opinion on the special business tax, it should now quickly send a telegram to the Federation of Industry and Commerce stating the decision to suspend operations and resist. The telegram read: "To the Zhenjiang Jiangsu Federation of Industry and Commerce, we have received your letter. The Provincial Government illegally implementing the special business tax, a disguised Li tax, is directly trying to put the merchants in a dead end. The fellow traders of our association have decided in a meeting that if the Provincial Government implements the levy, we will have no choice but to suspend operations as a whole to achieve the goal of abolishing it. We will first send a telegram to you and ask you how you will express your opinion. Please let us know." At the same time, it published a statement in the newspaper that it could not bear the burden.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Social Affairs Bureau's Final Mediation of Labor Unrest at Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Signed Settlement Agreement with Three Measures The Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, is a large-scale factory. It stopped working since the Shanghai incident and only started working on March 25. Under the pretext of sluggish business, it laid off more than 100 workers, which led to labor unrest. The party and government agencies have mediated repeatedly without any solution. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. was the deadline for the final mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs. The labor union of the dyeing industry in the three districts sent Li Junfeng and He Junhao as labor representatives, and all the workers came to petition, demanding a quick solution. The Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory sent Qian Zichao and Lu Shiyi as representatives. Zhou Lianze from the Municipal Party Department attended. Wang Xianqing, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, chaired the meeting, and Wang Zhiqin kept the records. After a long period of discussion, the settlement was finally signed at 7:30 p.m. The original text is recorded below. The dispute between the parties is about the workers' demands for work disputes. The Bureau convened a mediation, and with the consent of both parties, a settlement was recorded as follows: (1) In addition to fulfilling the labor-management settlement record signed on March 31 of this year, the employer will subsidize the temporary離關係 workers in Shanghai, such as Pan Shanglin, with 10 yuan per person to cover travel expenses back to their hometown. (2) The factory should, within its capabilities, discretionarily resume work. (3) If the workers who have temporarily離關係 do not wish to retire from the factory, the factory must provide a subsidy of 80 yuan per person. However, those who have received travel expenses will have the amount deducted upon retirement.</p>

<p>Hands and Feet Were Bound, Neck and Nose Were Injured</p>
<p>The Circumstances Indicate That the Body Was Moved After Death</p>
<p>No. 396 Laoshifu Road, French Concession is a new small house built not long ago. At around 2 p.m. yesterday, a cleaner, Mr. Jia, who was in charge of managing the houses in the area, was sweeping and came to the entrance of that number. He suddenly caught a glimpse of the light in the house that had not been turned off, and he was very suspicious. He stood at the door and shouted loudly for a long time, but no one answered. Seeing that the gate and fence were not closed, he pushed open the fence and entered. There was still no one there. He looked around the living room for a week. There was a reception table in the center, but nothing else. Several pairs of couplets were hung on the walls. One of them was signed "Ke Kun" at the top and "Dongshan樵子 Xie Hua" at the bottom, and "Xie Chen" at the top and "Xu Shiying" at the bottom. He climbed the stairs. There was only a half-iron bed in the front building, and the rest was scattered debris piled on the ground. When he looked at the back building, he suddenly saw a male corpse lying on the iron bed. At this point, Mr. Jia ran downstairs in extreme shock and immediately alerted the neighbors. They all gathered together and immediately reported it to the police. The police immediately sent detectives to investigate. They found that the deceased was about 30 years old, wearing a Western-style suit on the upper body and Chinese trousers on the lower body. His hands and feet were tightly bound, and there was a very deep knife wound on his neck and nose. There was an old mat on the floor, with bright red bloodstains on it. The situation indicated that he had probably been bound on the mat first, then stabbed to death, and then moved to the bed. The detectives then carried the corpse by car to the autopsy center of Tongrenfuyuan for an autopsy and reported to the Second Special Court for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Courtroom Spectacle: Lu Lan Chun <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Lu's Testimony Loud and Clear</p>
<p>Yu Weiwen's Lawsuit Rejected</p>
<p>The actress Lu Lan Chun, who once enjoyed great fame, suddenly had a man from Yancheng named Yu Weiwen (also known as Yu Cai Zhi), claiming to be Lu's father, involved in a lawsuit with her.  This went to the third instance court, where Yu ultimately lost, and the matter was put to rest. Unexpectedly, at the end of last year, Yu suddenly sued Lu for abandonment in the First Special District District Court. Because Lu had married Xue Gengsheng, he referred to her as Xue Yu Shi.  The court, based on the indictment, considered it a case involving direct relatives, which does not fall under the provisions for self-representation (private prosecution).  Therefore, without holding a hearing, it ruled to reject the private prosecution. Yu was still dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, which was also rejected.  Now, Yu has hired lawyer Song Yunhui, changed Cai Zhi to Weiwen, and filed another private prosecution with the First Special Court. He refers to the defendant not as Xue Yu Shi, but by her stage name.  The cause of action, however, remains abandonment.  The trial was originally scheduled for the afternoon of the day before yesterday, but at that time, the presiding judge, Mr. Wu Tingqi, was occupied with another case and could not attend to this one. It was postponed to yesterday afternoon. After 2:00 PM, many people arrived to observe. The original plaintiff and defendant, as well as their respective lawyers, also arrived at the Second Tribunal one after another. Lu Lan Chun, now thirty-six years old, still retains her charm.  Her long hair has been cut short, with a fringe covering her forehead. She wears a simple dark-colored, small checkered woolen qipao (cheongsam) and embroidered white satin boots. She speaks with a Beijing accent. Because she is accustomed to acting as a male lead, her voice is loud and clear, easily heard by everyone in the courtroom. Her demeanor is also very poised and generous.  At 3:30 PM, Judge Wu finished hearing the other case and turned to this one. He first asked the names, ages, and addresses of both parties, then instructed the plaintiff, "You already filed a private prosecution against the defendant in December of last year, which this court ruled to reject according to the law.  The ruling was delivered to your proxy lawyer, Zheng Wenkai, on January 13th of this year. You were still dissatisfied and filed an appeal, but the result was also a rejection. Why are you filing a private prosecution again now?"  Yu, upon hearing this instruction, claimed ignorance of the previous ruling. After the judge tossed the ruling for his review, he simply repeated his grievances. He then began to describe the past conflicts with the defendant, which did not seem relevant to the present case. The judge stopped him. Lu's defense lawyers, Wu Linkun and Wang [missing character], immediately requested that the plaintiff's suit be rejected again. They stated that this private prosecution by the plaintiff, except for the change of name, is based on the same facts as the previous suit.  The law stipulates that a case that has already been prosecuted cannot be brought before the same court again. Therefore, this case should be dismissed. This kind of lawsuit may not be the intent of the private prosecutor himself.  For example, in the previous indictment, they referred to themselves as father and daughter, but now they say adopted daughter. All of this is likely a scheme devised by his lawyer to try to deceive the court.  The judicial authorities have long had instructions regarding lawyers handling cases. This kind of behavior not only violates the law but also greatly harms lawyer's ethics, and so on. The plaintiff's lawyer declared that they were proceeding according to the client's instructions. Judge Wu then ruled to dismiss the private prosecution. After the ruling, the crowd of observers dispersed like a tide.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Xue's Nephew's Inheritance Dispute Appealed: Ruling <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Original Ruling Upheld, Nephew Wins</p>
<p>Appeal and Cross-Appeal Rejected</p>
<p>Hua Li Hou is the son-in-law of the late wealthy merchant Xue [missing character]run. Last year, after Xue's death, his estate was divided among his sons. Hua, based on current laws, believed that his deceased wife was also entitled to a share, and although his wife was deceased, her children should inherit in her place. Therefore, in the name of his son, Hua Shuanggu, and daughter, Hua Manyun, as their legal guardian, he hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, Zhang Jiahui, etc., to file a lawsuit against his brothers-in-law, Xue Jiasheng, Yansheng, and Gengsheng, to divide the property. The First Special District District Court ruled that the defendants should jointly pay the plaintiffs two-thirds of 500,000 yuan. The Xues, dissatisfied with the ruling, listed their reasons and filed an appeal, which was also concluded after review by the Second Branch of the High Court, which announced that it would set a date for judgment, as detailed in this newspaper. At that time, Hua Li Hou's side, because they had requested 500,000 yuan but were only awarded two-thirds, and also because the Xue side appealed, also filed a cross-appeal, stating that his son, Hua Yi Hong, had renounced his inheritance rights, which was an internal matter among the heirs. The original ruling only granted two-thirds because he was not included in the lawsuit, which was illegal. Furthermore, because the Xues were suspected of selling, transferring, and squandering the estate, they specifically requested a declaration of provisional execution. Now, the Civil Division Chief of the court, Hu Yigu, and judges Ye and Cai, have announced the judgment: "Main text: The appeal and cross-appeal are both rejected. The costs of the second instance litigation shall be borne by each party." The reasoning for the judgment, regarding the appeal portion, is divided into two points: (1) Regarding the issue of inheritance by representation, Article 1140 of the Civil Code states that if a first-priority heir as specified in Article 1138 dies or loses their inheritance rights before the commencement of inheritance, their direct lineal descendants shall inherit their share by representation. Furthermore, Article 2 of the Enforcement Act of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code states that even if the commencement of inheritance occurred before the implementation of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code, but after the following dates, women also have inheritance rights to the estates of their direct lineal ascendants: (1) The date of the second National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang's resolution on the women's movement reaching each province after being communicated by the Judicial Administration Committee in October of the 15th year of the Republic of China; (2) The date of the communication to provinces not yet under the jurisdiction of the National Government, or the date they came under jurisdiction, etc. In this case, the deceased, Xue Baorun, passed away in this city in August of the 19th year of the Republic of China. The commencement of inheritance was after being under the jurisdiction of the National Government. Although the respondents' mother died before the commencement of inheritance, according to the special provisions above, the respondents are entitled to claim inheritance by representation according to the Inheritance Law, regardless of when the death of the inheritor occurred. The interpretations of the Judicial Yuan Nos. 405 and 424 have lost their effect due to the implementation of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code, and the appellants cannot invoke them to argue that the respondents have no right to inherit by representation. (2) Regarding the issue of estate division, the appellants claim that the estate has already been divided. The evidence they presented is the will of the appellants' father and the certificate of managing the estate. Although the will states that the property is to be managed and distributed by the four appellants, it is insufficient to prove whether it has already been divided. Furthermore, at the time the will was written, the law had already clearly recognized women's right to inherit property, but the will designated all property to be inherited by the four appellants, disregarding other heirs. This violates the mandatory legal regulations, and this will does not have legal effect. The certificate of managing the estate is a small part of the estate. A detailed translation of the certificate's wording indicates that it is to be jointly managed by the appellants and cannot be designated as evidence that it has already been divided. Furthermore, the appellants have not presented any evidence that it has been definitively divided. Therefore, they cannot claim that it has already been divided to counter the respondents' request for analysis, etc. The reasoning for the cross-appeal portion is also divided into two points: (1) Regarding the issue of inheritance share; (2) Regarding the issue of provisional execution. However, they are not very important news, so they are omitted.</p>

<p>Fifteen Notorious Bandits Captured in Total</p>
<p>The General Patrol Station's Chinese Detective Huang Fusen learned that a man from Anhui named Wang Zixiang was part of a bandit gang. He arrested Wang at 155 Hankou Road, inside room of Asia Hotel, and brought him back to the police station. Under interrogation, it was revealed that accomplices were hiding at 23 Renji Lane, Ximen Road.

It was found that Sun Huashan was the former chief of the Nantong Public Security Bureau, now retired. Wang Kun was Chinese Constable No. 2904 of the Public Concession Police, who fled with a handgun and uniform in April of this year. Later, at 10 Renqing Lane, Baille Road, Chen Wangbo from Anhui, Chen Xu Shi, a woman from Jiangbei, and Chen Lianxiong, a child, were arrested, and thirty bullets were confiscated.

Yesterday morning, the fifteen men and women were sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division 1, where Judge Qian Hongye questioned them. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that due to the short time, the police station had not been able to conduct a detailed investigation, so they requested a postponement. Then, the Chinese and foreign detectives reported the circumstances of the arrest of each defendant. Sun Huashan hired lawyer Yu Hualong to defend him. Judge Qian verified the reports and briefly questioned each defendant, then ordered the case to be adjourned and the defendants returned to detention separately.</p>

<p>Six Seals of the 37th Army Found</p>
<p>Symbols, Commissions, and Instructions All Prepared</p>
<p>Seventeen Suspects Arrested in Total</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Sends Personnel to Request Transfer</p>
<p>Chinese Detective Liu Junqing of the Zhabei Police Station received a report that someone was organizing a fake military organization and selling official titles at room 35 of the Fozhao Building Hotel at 289 Shanxi Road. Detective Liu investigated for several days and confirmed the existence of this fake organization. At 9:15 AM the day before yesterday, together with Chinese Detective Chief You Agen, he went to the address and arrested Mao Shunfu from Shanghai, Wang Kedong from Hangzhou, Wu He from Wuxi, Lu Jinquan from Tongzhou, Jin Dongsheng from Baoshan, Xu Ciyuan from Shanghai, and six others. Six seals of the New Army 37th Army, eighty-five symbols, two commission certificates, eighty envelopes, one instruction book, and a large number of military documents were confiscated and brought to the police station. It was found that Xu Yuanyuan was the main culprit in the case and the "Division Commander" of the "Second Division" of the "Thirty-Seventh Army." Later, at room 13 of the Dong'an Hotel at 245 Guangdong Road, Zhou Guangzu from Changzhou, Jiang Zhonglin from Wuxi, Liu Zefang from Changzhou, Tang Ating, Zheng Bingzhang, Yang Binggang, Xu Guansheng, and Ding Mingyuan were arrested. Including the previous arrests, a total of fourteen people were detained separately. The police station sent them to the First Special Court's Criminal Division 1 yesterday morning. Mao Afu and Xu Ciyuan both hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them, and Tang Ating hired lawyer Jiang Chiping to defend him. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the Municipal Public Security Bureau had sent personnel to the case requesting a transfer, with official documents, but the Public Security Bureau only knew that the police station had arrested seven suspects, so the official documents only requested the transfer of seven suspects. Whether the case should be handled by the Public Security Bureau or the court, and whether the police station had not investigated clearly due to time constraints, was requested to be postponed to facilitate research on the issue of acceptance and to investigate who was related and who was not, so that they could separately request legal action or release. Interrogated Xu Ciyuan, confessed to being the Division Commander of the Second Division of the 37th Army, but claimed that he was commissioned by the Army Commander Chen Shenghao and that the army was stationed in Wuhan. But he did not know who commissioned Chen. The other defendants all claimed that they were visiting friends at the two hotels and were mistakenly arrested. Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the confessions and ordered the case to be adjourned and the defendants returned to detention separately.</p>

<p>Gu Baosen Hiding in Hotel</p>
<p>Plaintiff to Find a Way to Identify and Arrest</p>

Only the plaintiffs, Tan Wang Shi and Tan Ying, mother and daughter, along with lawyers Xu and Zhang, were present. The judge asked Tan Wang Shi, "This court issued an arrest warrant instructing you to identify and arrest him. Why has he not been arrested yet?" Tan Wang Shi replied, "By the time we went to arrest him, he had already fled." Asked, "Do you know where the defendant has fled to now?" She answered, "I heard that he is hiding in a hotel in the concession, but I cannot investigate which hotel at the moment." Asked, "Is your daughter Xiao Long?" She answered, "Yes." At this point, lawyer Zhang stated, "Please postpone the trial for one week so that the plaintiffs can make further efforts to investigate the defendant's hiding place and ensure that the defendant is arrested and brought to justice."

<h3 id="e138">National Medicine Industry Labor Strike Heard Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Since the representatives of the workers and the representatives of the National Medicine Trade Association, Zhang Meian, negotiated and talked the day before yesterday, both parties held meetings yesterday, and it is feared that it will not be resolved in a short time.</p>
<p>Workers' General Meeting Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, unemployed workers in the medicine industry held a general meeting at the meeting place of the Medicine Bureau Lane, Qiaojia Road. More than 300 people attended. Fang Qinghe, the director of the organization department, was elected chairman, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Investigate the member who asked for leave from various stores and did not hire unemployed workers as substitutes. Then dispatch members to fill in the case. The resolution was passed. (2) Investigate the names of non-members in various stores, negotiate with the Trade Association, and request that unemployed members be supplemented. The resolution was passed. (3) Organize unemployed groups. Before the establishment, five or seven representatives were appointed to be responsible for the process. The resolution was passed. It was decided to appoint Yi Guifang, Yu Guiqing, Shen Ziheng, Li Baokang, Xie Jixian, Zhong Debao, and Chen Weiming to be responsible for handling everything. The above cases were submitted to the Trade Union Council for approval and decision. The announcement was published, telling the employed members of the suffering of unemployment and asking for unified assistance.</p>
<p>Trade Association Emergency Meeting The National Medicine Trade Association held a second emergency executive committee meeting yesterday to discuss the three requests put forward by the Trade Union representatives. Chairman Cen Zhiliang decided that the requests made by the Trade Union were of great importance, and the entire executive committee should not handle them first. It will be submitted to the members' representative assembly on July 5 for discussion and processing. Regarding the facts of the negotiations between the Trade Union representatives and Zhang Meian, a standing committee member of the association, the association will issue a solemn statement to correct the public's perception and eliminate all misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Employer Statement The National Medicine Trade Association reported yesterday that the representatives of the Pharmacy Trade Union and Zhang Meian, a member of the Standing Committee of the association, had negotiated the results. Zhang stated that the original labor-capital contract proposed by the union continued to be valid, and the employer was not allowed to arbitrarily break it, as well as a salary increase of 10 yuan per person per month, and the placement of unemployed workers. The three requirements were fully accepted and promised to be submitted to the meeting for approval before a formal reply. The association considered the record to be untrue. The general employer was even more terrified after seeing the disclosure of this news, and they went to the meeting one after another to inquire about the truth. The association specially declared the actual situation of the negotiations a few days ago as follows: The Trade Union sent Zhao Fang, Feng Chen, Zhu and other five representatives to the association a few days ago, proposing that the employer should not break the labor-capital conditions, continue to hire substitutes, accept the placement of unemployed workers, and require a salary increase of 10 yuan. The four measures were requested to be fully answered by the association. The standing committee member of the association, Zhang Meian, answered item by item, saying that the employer has always abided by the conditions and has never broken them. However, the association may have difficulty in taking care of everything. If the union can report the facts of a store breaking the conditions, the association will severely correct it. If it is generally said that the employer has broken the conditions, it is very empty. It is up to the employer to hire substitutes, and the union must not force the union. If the union must force it, the employer will refuse the placement of unemployed workers according to law in order to protect its powers, and the association has already opposed the request for a salary increase of 10 yuan at the executive committee meeting. There is absolutely no room for discussion. However, if the union can take into account the social stability and does not want to expand the strike, the association expresses its sympathy. Regarding the above issues, the responsible representatives can be promoted by both labor and capital, and each group can form a joint committee to study and discuss item by item to seek a fair and peaceful solution as a buffer step. The Trade Union representative said that the labor side is also willing to form a joint committee, but the employer must continue to fulfill the substitute system as a prerequisite, otherwise there is no need to talk about anything. Zhang replied that since the union regards the substitute issue as the focus of the solution, he should report it to the association's executive meeting tomorrow, and formally reply to the union after the meeting has made a decision. This was the actual situation of the negotiations at that time, and the reporters from the news agencies also heard it at the scene. It is not allowed to confuse the public. It is only with this that it is closely related to the industry's labor strike this time, so a solemn statement is made.</p>
<p>Reply to the Trade Union To reply directly, I received a letter from your union a few days ago, in which you sent Zhao Zhenhui and other five representatives to the Standing Committee member of our association, Zhang Meian, and requested three items, and asked for a reply. It has been decided by the Executive Committee of our association yesterday that the three requirements put forward by your union are of great importance, and the Executive Committee of our association did not dare to decide without authorization, and intends to submit it to the members' meeting of our association on July 5 for discussion, so as to make specific replies based on public opinion. It is appropriate to send a letter of guarantee. Please check it and hope that your union will adhere to the principle of labor-capital cooperation and the spirit of overcoming difficulties together. Before the members' meeting of our association is convened, do not take any actions that will affect the social illness, which is what we pray for.</p>
<p>The City Party Department's Instructions The City Party Department instructed both parties, "For the purpose of ordering compliance, the report is based on the fact that the labor and capital parties in the pharmaceutical industry have disputes over labor-capital agreements, brewing strikes, and urgently need to find ways to mediate, etc. According to this, the labor-capital agreement of the industry was previously agreed upon and signed by both parties, and approved by the former Civil Training Committee of the association for filing. It should be abided by as a whole. If there are inconsistencies between the agreement and the current laws and regulations that need to be amended, the method drafted by the former Central Training Department should also be followed. The announcement issued jointly by the former Civil Training Committee and the Social Bureau of the association should be followed. The labor and capital parties should sign their opinions and submit them to the party and government agencies for review and revision. The old agreement of the industry has not been amended in accordance with the above methods, and should continue to be effective according to law. No party shall arbitrarily break it or make excessive demands beyond the scope of statutory benefits, causing disputes. According to the previous situation reported, in addition to ordering the industry (Trade Association) (Vocational Trade Union) to comply with it, it is urgently ordered that the association must comply with it strictly and not deliberately violate it. Be sure to order,"</p>
<h3 id="e139">China Merchants Electric Tramway Strike Trends <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Trade Union Issues Emergency Circular and Declaration</p>
<p>The situation of the workers of the China Merchants Electric Company in this city, for the expulsion of Zhu Shao-yi, the director of the car, has expanded. The Trade Union expressed its determination to deal with it with all its strength and never give in, and issued a declaration. Yesterday, the ticket inspector on the 19th and the ticket seller on the 8th were beaten. The details of the various situations are recorded below.</p>
<p>Trade Union Attitude The person in charge of the First District Water and Electricity Industry Trade Union said to a Xinsheng News reporter yesterday that the association was reorganized from the former China Merchants Electric Trade Union. Since the expulsion of Zhu strike occurred, a small number of workers have been fooled, so in recent days, there have been destructive advertisements published in the advertisement columns of various newspapers. The Trade Union is indignant about this matter, and is determined to impose severe punishments on the workers listed in the advertisement. Therefore, in the past two days, repentant workers have come to declare. As for opposing Zhu Shao-yi, they will go all out and never give in.</p>
<p>Workers Beaten Yesterday (29th) At about 9:00 AM, dozens of workers gathered at the company's gate. At about 10:00 AM, they rushed to the workers who were close to Zhu Shao-yi and issued warnings. At that time, Zhang Ruoyu, the ticket inspector on the 19th, was severely beaten due to his tough attitude, and some pranksters threw dung at him. At that time, the stench was overflowing, and everyone covered their noses. Then, dozens of workers pushed him into the Trade Union and interrogated him severely. At the same time, Zhan Yongyi, the ticket seller on the 8th, Hu Ruizhang, the ticket seller on the 96th, and another person named Zhu Baosen were also severely beaten. The workers were determined to use force against those who undermined the Trade Union.</p>
<p>Emergency Circular The First District Water and Electricity Industry Trade Union issued an emergency circular yesterday (29th), which read as follows: For the purpose of notification, regarding the case of Zhu Shao-yi's unreasonable oppression of workers, which led to a labor strike, Zhu Shao-yi has been using lackeys to do everything possible to undermine the unity of the association in recent days. According to the handwritten report of Zhan Yongyi, the ticket seller on the 8th, which is hereby published as follows: "I was used by someone on June [blank date] to go to a meeting at the Far East Hotel. The total number of people who attended included Yu Enhua on ticket 19, Lu Rongtang on 41, Dong Yiwu on 84, Hu Ruizhang on 96, Jin Zhongyong on 109, Tang Jinquan on 69, Zhu Hanhe on ticket 14, Zhou Guangrong on ticket 15, Zhang Ruoyu on ticket 19, Wang [blank character] on 20, Wang Xincheng on 21, Tang Junsheng on car 5, Zhang Hongyin on car 41, Liu Fusheng on 17, Cui Yuanlin on 14, Jiang Fushun on 45, and the listener Dong Yiwu, the ticket seller on 84, colluded and left. The chairman was Zhou Guangrong, the ticket inspector on 15. Everything I heard was improper, and I am now breaking away from the relationship. Today, I guarantee in front of the Trade Union to all the workers to expel Zhu Shao-yi without any regrets, etc." According to this, the lackeys who undermine the Trade Union have Zhan Yongyi, a worker who repented and proved to the association. The association will punish the instigator of the lackeys and give him severe punishment. All workers must not be used by the lackeys again, and this is important. (The declaration is lengthy and omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e140">Hill's Waterworks Report <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Information Office announced that Hill's report stated that the Review Committee met on June 20. In addition to the report, the opinions of the Finance Director and the Works Director were also presented, as well as a summary by the Chinese members. The main points were that the company should change to silver to calculate its capital. Also, a member stated his opinion that he did not want to criticize Hill's report. However, Hill's stay in Shanghai was short and he could not fully understand the local situation. In his opinion, the estimated amount of domestic water use per person per day in the report was too high. The leakage layer, due to loose joints and evaporation of water, did not seem to be fully included. Also, the company should reduce personnel and save expenses, and the smell of water in certain locations was not up to American standards. Furthermore, for poor users, the water package system should still be used to describe water use for heavy hygiene. The cost of installing water meters universally may not be worth the loss. The chairman of the committee replied that the expert's report did not seem to be easily criticized by outsiders. As for the universal installation of water meters, although the Chinese taxpayers' meeting made such a suggestion, the Public Works Department considered it beneficial. Hill also advocated installing meters without affecting the preferential treatment of poor users. The water quality layer was actually due to the muddy water source, but the company had responded to Hill's suggestion to build a large clear water pool. For the prevention of water leakage, Hill had also made some proposals. After further discussion, the committee suggested Zheng Duan, (1) Hill's report, recognizing the water price as fair and reasonable, and the efficiency of the company's organization and administration at all levels, requested the Board of Directors to accept. The other suggestions of Hill and the additional opinions of the Finance and Works Directors should be negotiated by representatives of the Public Works Department and the company, and special attention should be paid to the following items. (2) Regarding cost savings, personnel from the Public Works Department and the company should negotiate. (3) The company should be urged to continue its current policy of raising capital in silver. (4) In view of the reasons stated by the Finance and Works Directors, the price of fire-fighting water should not be increased. (5) The pricing after the universal installation of water meters should still be particularly preferential to poor and small users. (6) Article 17 of the concession contract, that is, the company's land may not be opened to the estimated price, and the above section may not be changed. The above suggestions have now been adopted by the Board of Directors.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Retrial of Former Mixed Court Cases by the First Special Court <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Some to Be Released Immediately</p>
<p>Some to Have Original Sentences Upheld</p>
<p>Murderer Subject to Increased Sentence</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Court, due to the illegality of the former Mixed Court's jury verdicts in English, has recently decided to rehear all uncompleted cases of this type to rectify them. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the court issued new verdicts in four more cases. Deng Haizhou and three others were sentenced to ten years in the Western prison on December 18th of the 13th year of the Republic for robbery. Among them, Liu, Wang, and Dong were released early based on the old regulations due to their remorse in prison and adherence to prison rules, according to the Western prison officials. Only Deng Haizhou remained, and according to the original sentence calculation, he was scheduled to be released on July 1st. Now, Judge Feng has changed the sentence to five years of imprisonment. Because the police lawyer Wang Yaotang declared the abandonment of the appeal, he was released in court immediately. (2) Lin Laowu and Chen Yunxiang were also sentenced to fifteen years each on October 15th of the 14th year of the Republic for robbery. Now, the sentence has been changed to eight years each, but the police lawyer has reserved the right to appeal, so this verdict is not yet considered final. (3) Guan Chaoyuan was sentenced to ten years for murder, and he is still sentenced to ten years, but the crime seems to be slightly different from before. (4) Yu Laifa was also convicted of murder and sentenced to ten years. Judge Feng reviewed the case and considered the previous sentence too light to atone for the crime, so he changed the sentence to fifteen years and advised that an appeal could be made according to the law. It has been found that more than ten cases have been reheard, and Yu Laifa is the first to have his sentence increased.</p>
<h3 id="e143">A Tale of Woe (啼笑因緣) Dispute <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Mingxing Film Company's production of the play "A Tale of Woe" has been in litigation with the Dahua Film Company for a long time over the issue of the screenplay registration and filming rights, but no satisfactory solution has been reached. Both sides are actively engaged in filming, sparing no effort. Recently, Mingxing Film Company has completed the first part of the play and screened it at the Nanjing Grand Theatre on Edward Road a few days ago. For days, crowds flocked to see it, and every performance was packed. Dahua Company Manager Gu Wuwei believes that the film adaptation rights of "A Tale of Woe" have been registered and approved by the Ministry of Interior, and the business is at stake, so he cannot allow other companies to remake and screen it. He filed a petition with the Second Special District Court the day before yesterday, willing to provide a guarantee to prohibit the screening of the film before a verdict is issued. After the petition was submitted the day before yesterday, the court did not issue the preliminary attachment order because of the late hour. It was not until 11:00 a.m. yesterday that the court issued it. Judicial police arrived at the Nanjing Grand Theatre at about 12:00 noon with the order, ordering it to stop the screening immediately. Mingxing Company Manager Zhang Shichuan went to the Second District Court to state the reasons and expressed willingness to provide a guarantee. The Second District Civil Court immediately approved the continuation of the screening, so the Nanjing Grand Theatre still screened "A Tale of Woe" three times yesterday at 3:00 p.m., 5:30 p.m., and 9:15 p.m. without stopping. However, starting today, the Mingxing side will automatically stop the screening and await a legal resolution.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Auction of Huang Chujiu's Hospital <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Association First Purchases</p>
<p>For a Price of 19,200 Taels</p>
<p>After the death of Shanghai tycoon Huang Chujiu, the Gongfa Company he operated, including the Day and Night Bank, the Great World, and the Deposit and Tour Department, simultaneously went bankrupt, owing more than three million yuan. Creditors filed lawsuits, and the former Mixed Court appointed accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Zheng to liquidate the assets, and the Huang family turned over private property to handle debts. Although two-tenths of the debts have been repaid, the lawsuit has not yet ended. Yesterday was the second public auction of Huang Chujiu's Hospital by the Second Special District Court. At 2:00 p.m., bidders Yuan Hesong, representing the New Pharmaceutical Association, and individuals Yin Zhibai, Li Xieqing, etc., accompanied by their proxy lawyers Yu Xiji and Zhao Chuanding, arrived at the court to await instructions. Others who arrived included Lawyer Tan Yigong representing the Huang family, Lawyer Peng Zhaoshi representing the Wanchun Silver Group, and Lawyer Yan Luqing representing the creditors. At 3:00 p.m., Judge Cao Jun opened the Fourth Civil Court for a public auction. Yuan Hesong, Yin Zhibai, Li Xieqing, and other agents successively increased the price. Finally, each bid reached 19,200 taels. Because the New Pharmaceutical Association bought this to establish a charitable cause, the association was the first to purchase it. According to the agent lawyers of Yin and Li, although the New Pharmaceutical Association has purchased it now, if the transaction fails, their clients are still willing to increase the price. At that time, please open the court again for public auction. The court approved and adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Formal Establishment of Chinese Military Music <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce established Chinese military music, which was formally established the day before yesterday. There are a total of 60 members in the team and 20 reserves. Every Tuesday and Thursday evening from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., they will be formally trained in the conference hall of the Chamber of Commerce. Zheng Jinwen is the general instructor, and Xu Ruhui and others are assistant teachers. The musical instruments are divided into four categories: (wind), (string), (bowed), and (percussion), with a total of 32 kinds. All team members are able to study seriously, and future achievements can be guaranteed. The first step in training is to start with the flute as a basic exercise. Once there is some progress, they will be divided into classes for specialized study. All musical instruments are manufactured by the Datong Music Society, with the standard of being light and easy to carry. The music used is based on folk songs. That night, each person was given a xiao and a flute, and the timbre was uniform. In addition, the musical instruments are being rushed to be made, and they will be completed by mid-next month. In the future, the provinces will follow suit, and the scale will be even greater.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Record of the Welcome Meeting at the Guangzhao Public Association <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>All Had Earnest Speeches Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., the Shanghai Guangzhao Public Association specially held a tea party to welcome philanthropists Chen Lianbo, Zhou Shouchen, Cai Chang, and Li Yutang. Guests included Zhu Qinglan, Zhang Peiyan, Cha Liangzhao, Yan Zhifang, Chen Jintao, Wen Yingxing, Cai Zengji, and directors and councilors of the association. It was quite a grand occasion. At 5:00 p.m., the guests and hosts dispersed in joy. The speeches of Wen, Chen, and Cai are listed below:</p>
<p>Wen Zongyao's Speech: Mr. Chen Lianbo, Chairman of the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong, Sir Zhou Shouchen, Chinese Representative of the Legislative Council, and Mr. Cai Chang, Chairman of the Guangzhou Convenience Hospital, have come to Shanghai for official business, allowing us to take this opportunity to hold a meeting here to welcome and thank them in person. It is extremely gratifying. Everyone in Guangdong knows that you are tireless in doing good deeds and courageous in doing what is right. During the Shanghai war, you raised huge sums of money in Hong Kong and Guangzhou and remitted them to Shanghai, which was not only enough to relieve the refugees, but also had a surplus to help various hospitals and schools. All the compatriots in Shanghai are deeply grateful. On behalf of all the beneficiaries, I thank you. Although the Shanghai war lasted only a little over a month and the area was only Songhu, the planes and fierce cannons were even worse than the invasion of Beijing by the Eight-Nation Alliance in the Gengzi year. It is estimated that more than 240,000 compatriots died, and Guangdong people accounted for one-third of them. The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) cannot escape its responsibility for this matter. After the incident, I personally inquired about everything. According to the investigation, Japan had already decided to open fire that night, regardless of whether we accepted its conditions or not. The SMC knew this a long time ago, but because none of the five Chinese directors of the SMC were from Guangdong, the news was blocked and they did not know the situation, which was one of the reasons for the disaster. There are more than 200,000 Guangdong people in Shanghai, and everything the SMC does has a close relationship with them, but there is no representative from Guangdong among the Chinese directors, which is the most strange and unfair thing. Our compatriots in Shanghai should stand up and fight for it. Starting from the next session, at least one of the five Chinese directors of the SMC must be a representative from Guangdong. This is the minimum limit. This intention should be stated to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association. In the early days of the establishment of the Chinese directors of the SMC, Huang Mingdao, the manager of the Xinhua Bank, was elected as a Chinese director to represent the Guangdong people. Later, Mr. Huang resigned due to disagreement, and there has been no representative from Guangdong since then. Now Guo Shun has been elected as an advisor, but the status of a Chinese advisor is very different from that of a Chinese director. Our Guangdong people must pay attention. This time, our compatriots have been spared from being displaced thanks to your help, and we are as grateful as if we have been reborn. At this point, the chairman asked everyone to stand up and express their gratitude to Mr. Chen and others, and wish them good health.</p>
<p>Chen Lianbo's Speech: After the Shanghai incident, all Guangdong people were worried because most of our Guangdong compatriots in Shanghai lived in the Zhabei area, so they were all in a state of anxiety. At that time, there was already an organization of the Guangdong Compatriots Relief Association in Shanghai. We then initiated a fundraising with various gentry and merchants. However, we were just spending more effort for our fellow villagers. We are comfortable in Hong Kong and Guangdong and feel guilty for not being able to do more. How dare we speak of merit? Looking at this war of resistance against Japan, the Guangdong people are the ones who are leading the charge, and the Guangdong people are the ones who are relieving the refugees. In all righteous deeds, the Guangdong people can die for the country. In this time of national crisis, it is especially important to unite and combine the compatriots in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangdong into one, so that the success in the future will be limitless.</p>
<p>Cai Chang's Speech: Whenever there are disasters in Guangdong Province, the funds raised locally are insufficient, and we rely on the donations of compatriots in Shanghai, Hankou, and overseas. I am very sorry. During this Shanghai incident, Guangzhou raised little money due to the depression in the market, but it was only a small effort. However, Hong Kong is relatively affluent, so it was able to raise huge sums of money. The Convenience Hospital has no savings and relies only on donations, but the money donated is enough to cover the expenses. Therefore, this time it has accommodated more than 15,000 refugees sent back to Guangdong from Shanghai. In addition to sending them back to their hometowns, each person was given four yuan. This amount of money is also very large. At present, there are 300 to 400 refugees who have returned to Guangdong and plan to return to Shanghai to work. They are all funded by the Convenience Hospital to go to Shanghai, and each person is given ten yuan so that they will not be in poverty after arriving in Shanghai. In the future, I hope that all compatriots in the province and abroad will unite in the face of disasters and devote themselves to relief work. I especially hope that the compatriots in Shanghai will work together in harmony to receive the help of Heaven and help themselves.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Opening of the Zhonghe Bulb Company Today <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>General Electric, Osram, and Philips are the Best-Selling Bulbs in the World. In order to reduce manufacturing costs and save on distribution expenses, a joint organization distribution office has been established in China, named Zhonghe Bulb Company. The address is temporarily set at 49 Beijing Road, and business will begin on July 1st. Tea and refreshments are specially prepared to invite Shanghai's electrical industry colleagues and all walks of life. The past history and recent business overview of the three companies are briefly described below: (1) General Electric Edison. The American General Electric Company has been in business for more than 50 years since Edison invented the bulb. It has been improved and refined, and its branches are all over the world. The General Electric Edison Factory in Shanghai was founded 15 years ago by the current general manager Pan Qijun. It covers an area of 130 mu and has more than 1,000 workers. In addition to manufacturing electrical materials, it can now produce 40,000 light bulbs per day. (2) Osram. The Berlin Osram Factory in Germany was formed in 1919 by the merger of three bulb factories: Siemens, AEG, and others. At that time, the three factories had 30 years of experience in manufacturing bulbs. Osram is the largest bulb factory in the world outside of the United States. It sells well all over the world. In addition to the three main factories in Berlin, there are 10 branches in various parts of Europe. In addition, there are affiliated glass factories, coal factories, and machine factories, which are not included. The Berlin headquarters is now equipped with several new machines for manufacturing glass bulbs, each of which can produce 50,000 bulbs per day. In 1930, the total output of Osram was 120 million bulbs, which were distributed all over the world. Users all praised it. (3) Philips. The Philips Bulb Factory is the largest factory in the Netherlands. It was founded in 1891 by electrical engineer Mr. Philips. It has been expanded and now has 20,000 workers. It can produce 70 million bulbs per year. The factory is located in the southern part of the Netherlands. All glass, filaments, cardboard boxes, and other parts for manufacturing bulbs are manufactured by Philips in its own factory. It also has a very large research institute, which is the leading one in Europe and is famous all over the world. (4) The contents of the Zhonghe Bulb Company. The Zhonghe Bulb Company has now hired Mr. Macy, formerly of the Philips Foreign Firm, as the general manager. Mr. Macy founded the Shanghai Philips Foreign Firm and has been engaged in the bulb business for ten years. In addition, Mr. Cliff, formerly of the General Electric Edison Company, has been hired as the manager of the sales department, and Mr. Russell, formerly of the Osram Foreign Firm, has been hired as the manager of the general affairs department. The three gentlemen are all experienced. They have now joined the new company, and Pan Qijun, the general manager of the Edison Factory, can also assist from time to time. In the future, the business will definitely flourish and will be of considerable assistance to the progress of China's electrical industry.</p>

<p>Important Education News</p>
<h3 id="e162">Hunan Province Holds Graduation Examinations <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Students Request the Withdrawal of the Order. A Changsha dispatch states that the Hunan Education Department, acting on the order of the Ministry of Education to hold graduation examinations for students, proposed at the first meeting to establish the "Hunan Middle School Graduation Examination Committee" and hired fourteen people, including Huang Shiheng and Ou Minggao, as committee members. The designated subjects for the examinations are as follows: For senior high school, Party Principles, Chinese Language, Mathematics, History, Geography, Chemistry, Biology, Foreign Language, Physical Education, and ten other subjects. For junior high school, Party Principles, Chinese Language, Mathematics, History, Geography, Nature, Physical Education, Foreign Language, and eight other subjects. For all students taking the examination, it is stipulated that if a student fails in one or two subjects, they may retake the failed subjects once. If the retake is still unsuccessful, they are allowed to take a remedial course for one academic year and participate in the examination for those subjects again during the next term, but only once. Those who fail in three or more subjects will be required to repeat the grade. Due to the approaching summer vacation and the pressing time constraints, preparations are being actively carried out, and a founding meeting will be held at the Education Department at 2:00 PM today to complete the arrangements within two weeks. Upon hearing the news, the graduating students from over ten schools, including Hunan University, No. 1 Middle School, No. 1 Normal School, Mingde, Qunfa, Agricultural Vocational School, and Duize, totaling approximately 1,500 people, each appointed representatives to hold a joint meeting at the Education Association and decided to express the difficulties of the examination and request the provincial government to withdraw the order. The reasons they hold are as follows: (1) Each school follows the Ministry's order of the 18th year of the Republic and divides into Arts and Science disciplines. This examination did not differentiate them, and the nature of the subjects before and after is naturally different. (2) The examination order was only announced in the past two days. To test three years' worth of subjects in one day is neither permitted by time nor by mental capacity. (3) Entrance examinations for various universities in the country, such as Nanjing University, will be held as early as July 3rd. Other universities, such as Wuhan University, mostly start registration in early July, with no extensions. It seems inappropriate to hinder the opportunity for higher education with the examination. (4) The examination has not been held in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which proves that it is difficult to comply with this order before the middle school curriculum system is unified. Not only do middle schools in our province have different curriculums, but their teaching is also independently administered. Since they all share this special situation, they should be treated the same way. (5) The Ministry of Education also considered the difficulties of suddenly holding this examination this term and clearly ordered each province that, if there are special circumstances that prevent the examination from being held, they can report it for record-keeping and be exempted from holding it, leaving room for flexibility. Since our province has such difficulties, it should be included in the list of exemptions from the examination. (6) Senior high schools in this province generally implement a credit system. Once the credits are completed, students can graduate. Now that the required credits have been completed, it seems unnecessary to participate in this examination according to the regulations. At the same time, they also sent a letter to the Student Union, asking it to forward the request to the Provincial Party Department to send a letter requesting exemption from the examination. However, the Provincial Government believes that this examination is imperative and will not be cancelled due to students' requests.</p>

The content of the curriculum remains the same as the original, but in the first paragraph of the second article on objectives, "leadership" is changed to "promotion," and the second paragraph is changed to "imparting basic knowledge of local autonomy and practicing four types of application in order to expand the civil rights movement." In the curriculum content, under A. regarding moral education, "center" is changed to "subject," and (4) is changed to "in the arithmetic class, practicing precise and correct thinking to promote the practice of morality."

<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a telegram from five cultural institutions in Beiping requesting that the American Lan Youjin be ordered to leave the country, in addition to the previous official letter to the governments of the four provinces of Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai, recently sent a cable to the governments of the three provinces of Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Gansu, stating that according to a telegram from the Beiping Antiquities Preservation Committee and other five cultural institutions, the American Lan Youjin, without a government passport, secretly brought his wife and another American, Lu Gen, to Baotou in mid-May, carrying a large number of guns and ammunition, and planned to transfer to Wuyuan, Ningxia, Wufosi, Lanzhou, Liangzhou, Xining, and other places. They requested that the governments of Sui, Gan, and Qing provinces be quickly telegraphed to order him to leave the country within a time limit and confiscate the unlicensed guns and ammunition to protect the authority of the central government and avoid setting a bad diplomatic precedent. After checking, this Ministry previously approved a letter from the National Central Research Institute with the same content and forwarded it for review and handling. Now, based on the telegram with the previous information, a corresponding cable is being sent to inform you to investigate, order him to leave the country within a time limit, and confiscate the unlicensed guns and ammunition. Please reply.</p>

<p>Difficulties in Education Funding: Suspension of Enrollment at Rural Normal Schools. The Jiangyin Education Bureau held its fifth County Education Administrative Conference at 2:00 PM on the 27th, with Bureau Chief Wang Zhonglin presiding. Key resolutions: (1) The name of the Experimental Elementary School will be cancelled starting from the 21st year since it has not been approved by the Education Department. (2) Two central elementary schools will be piloted this year, one to be converted from the county-run experimental elementary school, and the other to be established by the Education Bureau in a suitable location in the countryside. (3) Xu Jiang, the principal of the Rural Normal School, proposed that 50 freshmen in the undergraduate program should be opened this year to complete the four-year standardization system. After discussion, due to the extreme difficulties in education funding in this county, there is no capacity for expansion. All enrollment at the school this year should be suspended. The rural normal school students come from poor families, and the food expenses should be changed to half the amount, with full food provided and verified by name. (4) Starting this year, schools with insufficient enrollment should be thoroughly reorganized by the Education Bureau. (5) The operating expenses for the Simple Science Museum will be provided from the arrears collected from various items such as the busy season grain tax. (5) The education budget for the 21st year was revised and approved. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Labor University Faculty and Staff Protect the School Association Hosts Reporters Yesterday <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Representatives Head to Beijing This Morning to Petition. The Labor University Faculty and Staff Protect the School Association hosted news reporters at the China Press yesterday. Chen Binhe from Shen Bao, Gu Zhizhong from Xinwen Bao, Zhu Qiran from Da Wan Bao, Shao Piaopiao from Xinsheng Bao, Fang Juying from Chen Bao, and dozens of Labor University faculty and staff, including Zhang Yuanruo, Tang Ying, and Han Yanmen, attended. Chairman Zhang Yuanruo gave a speech, saying that before explaining the work of protecting the school, he, on behalf of his colleagues, thanked the reporters. The association feels very fortunate that you have come. The association has been working on protecting the school for half a month. This protection of the school is neither to protect any individual nor to protect the status of the colleagues, narrowly speaking, it is to protect all the poor students of the school, and broadly speaking, it is to protect the entire Chinese labor education. This level should be observed clearly by people in society. The reasons for the Ministry of Education to shut down Labor University are nothing more than that the achievements are not significant, the equipment is incomplete, and the losses are too great. However, none of these are valid reasons. It takes a hundred years to nurture people, and the principle of education is like this. The Ministry of Education is too complimentary to say that Labor University, which has only five years of history, has made special achievements. In recent years, not only is there no achievement in Chinese education, but there is no achievement in everything. How can Labor University be solely blamed? As for saying that the equipment is incomplete and the losses are too great, and it is difficult to raise large funds to restore it, it is also an excuse. If responsibility is to be pursued, the first question should be why the Ministry of Education reduced and stingily issued the funds for Labor University. Labor education is the lifeline of China, where the rural areas are collapsing and the handicrafts industry is bankrupt, and it is urgently needed. The shutdown cannot be ordered on the grounds of financial difficulties and no funds for restoration.</p>
<p>Faculty and Staff Head to Beijing This Morning. The representatives of the Faculty and Staff Protect the School Association of the school, Zhang Yuanruo, Wang Wuyin, Tang Ying, Ma Shouzheng, and Zhen Jing, five people, took the express train to Beijing at 9:20 this morning (30th) to meet with President Wang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Zhu of the Education Department. At the same time, they also brought a petition from the association and letters from the 93-year-old Ma Xiangbo to President Wang, Minister Zhu, President Jiao of the Supervisory Yuan, and President Li of the Legislative Yuan for personal presentation, asking them to withdraw the order and achieve the goal.</p>
<p>Telegram from the School Protection Committee. The Express Mail Telegram from the Faculty and Staff Protect the School Committee of Shanghai National Labor University reads: All levels of party departments, education departments of all provinces, schools at all levels, academic organizations, newspapers, social organizations, labor and peasant associations, please note that labor education is the only opportunity for poor students to seek knowledge and the only organization to cultivate future citizens with both hands and brains. The collapse of rural China, the bankruptcy of the handicrafts industry, the decline of people's livelihood, and the weakening of the nation all rely on the promotion of labor education to revive. The colleagues of the school believe that educating for labor and laboring for production is the only way to revitalize the Chinese nation. Training for reproduction should be done in ten years. Schools should be industrialized, and students should be militarized to cultivate citizens who can win both economic and military wars. However, the Ministry of Education disregards the people's livelihood, ignores the nation, arbitrarily destroys labor education, and orders the closure of Labor University. It is the height of madness. We have always admired your righteousness and courage. Please resonate, quickly cable the Ministry of Education, withdraw the order, and extend great righteousness. Labor education is fortunate, and the poor students of China are fortunate.</p>

<p>— A Reclusive Husbandman Who Does Not Weed the Courtyard</p>
<p>On the morning of the forty-second day, I saw a piece of paper on Mr. Zhu's desk with these words written on it:</p>
<p>'"They don't want him in the city, so he ran to the countryside."</p>
<p>They say that, and it counts me as untalented.'</p>
<p>A person who has just arrived in the countryside and has received this blow, no matter how optimistic they are, it is always difficult to avoid some discouragement. Mr. Zhu, however, did not mind at all. At least, there was no hint of complaint on his face. The four lines of poetry he wrote seem as bland as rice soup at first glance, but upon careful observation between the lines, one sees a gentleman willing to suffer small losses active on the paper. I said to Mr. Zhu, "Someone once said, 'I will be a dragon or a tiger as people call me a horse or an ox.' The little poem you wrote has this kind of ambition." Mr. Zhu said, "I just wrote it casually as a reference for self-cultivation. It can't be considered any kind of ambition. But since you mentioned these two idioms, I would like to reverse them and use them as a motto for us to encourage each other. Dragons are mythical creatures, and tigers sometimes eat people. It is the oxen and horses that are the loyal servants of the people." After he said this, he picked up his pen and wrote:</p>
<p>'I will be an ox or a horse: Let people call me a tiger or a dragon.'</p>
<p>'What do you think?' 'Your revision allows me to see a new mission in the midst of glorious and bitter life. You have opened up an indescribable realm of wonders in the ordinary world before you. I have decided to follow you on a tour through this wonder.'</p>
<p>Although Mr. Zhu is optimistic, his work here has been met with great resistance. "The one in the ancient temple has no ability" has spread throughout the world, all the way to Zhang Huzi's tobacco shop. Bricklayer Lao Xu then allied with Zhang Zi to oppose Mr. Zhu, instigating parents and students not to cooperate with Mr. Zhu.</p>

<p>Thirteen to Two Big Victory ｜ A Scene from the Lawn Tennis League ｜</p>
<p>The Chinese Tennis Club has been winning consecutive battles. Yesterday, it defeated the French Business General Association by thirteen to two at the French Business General Association court on Xiafei Road. This was the third victory in the Lawn Tennis League. The French Business Association has strict access control and refused to allow visits, so only reporters from various newspapers and a few socialites were present to add color. Each group of the Chinese Association won without much difficulty. Lin Zheng played casually, and although Zheng Zhaojia sometimes had highly praised balls, there were also times when he lost due to a lack of control. The most remarkable thing was that the fourth group, Qian Wu, turned a 0 to 5 defeat in the second set into an 8 to 6 victory, which was no easy feat. (1) Lin Baohua Six to Three Bellende Six to Zero Zheng Zhaojia Six to Four Mi Yes Jiang Daozhang Six to Four Kelanov (2) Six to Two Yu Tianguang Six to Two Tui Na Tu Kaiyuan Six to Eight Fen Si (3) Six to Three Liang Deguang Six to One Gao Bolan Qian Yaobin Four to Six Te Larei (4) Eight to Six Wu Zhuren Six to Four Ta Folasi Guo Qida Six to Three Grant (5) Six to One Feng Xikang Six to Three Halis</p>

<p>Sydney Dispatch. The Australian team selected to participate in the Olympics totals twelve people, eight men and four women.</p>
<p>Male Athletes. Only two men have a chance of scoring points. (1) Pan Ersai, who resides in Canada. Pan was the champion of the 1928 Amsterdam double sculls (one person rowing with two oars). Although Pan lives in Canada, he still retains Australian citizenship. In this year's competition, Pan can still win all long and short-distance boat races unless Pan has weakened in strength, in which case it should be considered an exception. (2) Swimming athlete Que Erden. In the previous competition, Que won second place in both the 400-meter and 1,500-meter freestyle. He went to the United States this time, not long after recovering from illness, but it did not affect his performance. In the Sydney Championship in January, Que's 800-yard result was 10 minutes and 22 seconds, only 1.3/5 seconds away from Kraebb's (US) world record. The hopes of the remaining six male athletes are very weak. Xu Huosi will participate in the 1,500-meter, but his mile result is 4 minutes and 20 seconds. The fact that Carlton, who is no longer practicing sports, is a major blow to Australia. His 100-yard result is 9.6 seconds, and his 220-yard result is 22.6 seconds.</p>
<p>Female Athletes. Of the four female athletes, two have a chance of scoring points. (1) Miss Wei En has hope in the 100-meter. Her 100-yard result on grass is 11.2 seconds, only 4/10 of a second away from Walsh's world record. (2) Miss Danis's 200-meter breaststroke is 3 minutes and 8.6 seconds, breaking the Olympic record by 3 seconds and Miss Xingdeng's American record by 1.4/5 seconds.</p>

<p>Hills and Panlai Were Also Eliminated. London, 28th. The situation in the Wimbledon World Tennis Championships has suddenly changed due to today's results. The three most promising people to win the quarter-finals in the men's singles were all eliminated. It is even stranger that last year's champion Wood lost to Japan's Sato. The results of the four groups are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Van Nies (US) Six to Two Maner (Spain) Six to Three Six to Two Seven to Five</p>
<p>(2) Crawford (Australia) Eight to Six Panlai (England) Two to Six Eight to Six Six to One</p>
<p>(3) Austin (England) Nine to Seven Hills (US) Five to Seven Six to One Seven to Five</p>
<p>(4) Sato (Japan) Seven to Five Wood (US) Two to Six Six to Four</p>
<h3 id="e180">Crawford Fought Fiercely to Defeat Panlai <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Van Nies Defeated Maner. Van's powerful shots and cannonball serves were no match for Maner. Crawford and Panlai determined the outcome after a fierce battle. A portion of Panlai's previous... They were a championship athlete, but the Australian champion was not to be outdone. Crawford's performance was extremely excellent, with unparalleled accuracy. Several times, baseline corner kicks sent the line chalk flying. Many points were also scored by serves. When Panlai was tied at six to six in the last set and was leading by three points to one, there was hope of recovery, but unexpectedly, Panlai offered two consecutive sets.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Austin Returns to Original State <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Austin's victory over Hills, who reached the finals last year, was greatly celebrated by the British. Austin has fully recovered to his original state and has a great chance of winning the championship. Austin constantly attacked with corner kicks, interspersed with extremely clever half-court balls and cross-court chops, leaving Hills with no time to respond.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Sato Defeats Last Year's Champion <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Sato defeated last year's champion Wood. Sato's judgment was excellent, and his net play was perfect. In the first game, Wood did whatever he wanted, making Sato run around in exhaustion. As one set was about to end, Sato suddenly perked up, often intercepting the net and returning the ball without waiting for it to land. The competition in the second game was also extremely fierce, with both sides going up and down from time to time. Sato also won with seven to five. The third game was quite short. Initially, Sato was on the baseline, placing the ball left and right, very calmly. Wood ran east and west, unable to cope, and lost two consecutive games. But at this time, the momentum suddenly turned, and Sato sometimes showed slack. Wood won six consecutive sets and won the third game. In the fourth game, Sato won the first three to one, and five to four. In the last game, he won four straight to seal the victory.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Humility: Auspicious and Inauspicious <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In the hexagrams and lines, there are both ill omens and auspicious signs, but only the Humility hexagram has all six lines being auspicious. People in big cities who use the characters for "humility" and "auspiciousness" in their names are numerous. To take just recent examples, there's Yoshizawa Kenkichi, who attended the League of Nations; Ueda Kenkichi, who invaded Shanghai; and Saito Kenkichi, who led the puppet state's athletes to Los Angeles to participate in the World Games. One Kenkichi here, another Kenkichi there, then yet another Kenkichi—it seems the three islands of Japan have become a production center for modest gentlemen.</p>
<p>However, examining their actions to see if they match their names, not one of them can be considered a modest gentleman. The first Kenkichi, at the League of Nations, turned black into white, acting inhumanely. Where was the humility there? The second Kenkichi led troops to Shanghai, engaging in a month-long battle. Where was the humility there? The third Kenkichi attended the World Games, preparing to expand propaganda for the puppet state and aid treason. Where was the humility there? The names of these three all contain the character for humility, but their actions are the opposite. Instead of calling them Kenkichi, it would be more honest to call them Fuken-kichi (Immodest Auspicious).</p>
<p>We Chinese, on the other hand, have many truly modest gentlemen. Those who declared long-term resistance have turned into long-term non-resistance. Why long-term non-resistance? Because they want to be modest gentlemen. Those who declared they would not submit to oppressive powers have now signed agreements. Why sign agreements? Only to be modest gentlemen. If that's the case, then the production center for modest gentlemen is not the three islands of Japan, but China!</p>
<p>However, the true essence of humility is that it should be directed inward, not outward. To act as a modest gentleman externally to the point of losing rights and national dignity is unacceptable! Such modest gentlemen are not within the scope of the Humility hexagram, and I fear all six lines would be inauspicious for them. Therefore, we have a definitive three-character assessment for China's modest gentlemen: Qian Bu Ji (Humility: Inauspicious).</p>
<h3 id="e184">On the Proportions of Tall and Short People <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Chang Shude from Henan Province recently came to Shanghai from Beijing to seek medical treatment in a hospital. Those who saw him were amazed, saying that he was not yet old but his height exceeded that of an average person several times over. He previously served as a flag officer under Ji Hongchang and as a clerk for the National Games in the capital. He reportedly ate one chicken and forty eggs every day, and also consumed twenty-four steamed buns for lunch. He could indeed be called a remarkable person. In contrast, there is the short person Tang Yisan, who is already forty years old but not even three feet tall. He is from Naxi County in Sichuan Province and resides on Avenue Joffre. He also once served as a military intelligence agent in Sichuan. For a time, the tall and short reflected each other, a rare occurrence. This was exaggerated into a curious tale and spread throughout Shanghai. I recall that four years ago, there was a tall person named Liu Ruqing who returned from the United States with a large fortune and lived leisurely in Beiping. Now, Chang Shude is also meeting people at the Rongji Great World to give a public farewell before setting off on a trip to various countries in Europe and America. Compared to the short Tang Yisan, he is no more than a sparrow under the eaves, chirping alone, looking up at the phoenix soaring into the sky. Anthropologists often say that people were tall in ancient times but are short now. There were those whose bodies covered several acres and whose one finger could cover Mount Taihang. The "Spring and Autumn Annals" mentions a tall Di named Qiaoru, but his exact height is not detailed. King Wen was ten feet tall, Tang was nine feet, and Cao Jiao was nine feet four inches. Yet, it is also said that "a child of five feet." The inconsistency of ancient and modern measurements is evident here. However, a person's height and the strength of their race are not without relation. I have examined that the shortest people today are the Eskimos in the northern regions of Australia and those who live near the northern part of Europe. They are just over four feet tall. People from Luzon and Malacca are also short. The black people in the southern part of Fiji who live in the forests are mostly only over three feet tall. The tallest are the Norwegians, the French Canadians, the red people of Canada, the Kafirs of East Fiji, and the Patagonians of South America. Australians are all over five feet tall. These are all compared using today's measurements. Generally speaking, this is the case.</p>
<p>However, there are those with exceptional natural gifts. In the thirteenth year of the Guangxu Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, a Greek man came to Shanghai who was over seven feet five inches tall. A French soldier stood shoulder to shoulder with him and was completely surpassed in height. An Austrian man was as tall as eight feet seven inches, and no one dared compare themselves to him. These are all recorded in the book "Thousands of Strange and Wonderful Things" of the Shanghai Machine Bureau, and can be verified. At that time, a man named Zhan from Anhui was also known in Shanghai for his height. Later, he was taken away by a Westerner and was able to travel overseas in luxury, returning laden with riches. At the beginning of his existence, who knows why Heaven bestowed such unique excellence upon him. It is said that a certain Russian man, already in his twenties, weighed only five French pounds and was just over one and a half feet tall. His father loved him like a pearl in his palm, often helping him stand on a table to play with him. His shortness can be imagined. The Japanese often call us "short slaves" and give him the epithet "many bumps." When the Japanese army invaded our city this time, apart from the old Dongyang (Japanese headquarters interpreter), almost all of them were robust and tall, superior to our soldiers. Experts say that their average height has increased year by year for the past forty years, and has now increased by as much as one and a half to one and six tenths of a foot. This saying is close to the truth. Alas, one can also gain insight into national character from this.</p>
<h3 id="e185">After Reading Chen Shuren's Art Exhibition <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>The art scene in the capital has been quiet for a long time. The vulgar world is like a hedgehog gathering, and our artistic spirit is bleak. As the intense heat spreads, our hearts feel even more parched. Fortunately, Mr. Shuren's art exhibition opened, so I accompanied Manhua to appreciate his fine works. The venue was the newly built National Assembly Hall of the Central University. The left-side upstairs and downstairs halls displayed dozens of works. Landscapes and birds-and-flowers each occupied half. The brushwork was gentle, and the style was unique. His paintings of Guilin's landscapes use a central brushstroke for outlining, with simple colors. The peaks and ridges are stacked, and the strange rocks are steep. I love his works "Solitary Beauty Peak," "Elephant Trunk Hill," "Fishing Boat on the Riverbank," and "Flying Waterfall at Dinghu," which use light and agile brushstrokes to depict the colors of the water and mountains, with a poetic flavor. My friend Mr. Binhong visited Guilin several years ago and showed me his works upon his return. I couldn't help but be fascinated. The Shanzi brothers, Daqian, explored Mount Huang, and Yu Zihua roamed Yandang Mountain with pride, looking up and down, capturing everything. Their works have long been seen by the Chinese people. Chinese landscapes, from Jing Hao and Guan Tong onwards, although giants have appeared in each generation, they have inherited from each other too much and lacked creative meaning. For an artist to strive towards the natural world is truly the only way to revive Chinese painting.</p>
<p>The most exquisite of the flower paintings are "Peach Blossoms Heavy with Rain," "Lingnan Spring Colors," "Pear Blossoms Heavy with Rain," and "New Willow" and "Spring Light." The colors are bright and moving. The space of a foot is filled with fresh air. "Lingnan Spring Colors" was exhibited at the Belgian Exposition, winning appreciation from Europeans. That year, I happened to accompany Mr. Minyi to Europe and participated in the event, having seen it before. I remember a poem inscribed on his "Spring Light" painting: "The heart for endless competition never ceases, Who is willing to come to the mountains and forests? It is pitiful that the spring light is infinitely beautiful, Only a small bird can appreciate it." The artist's calm mind can be glimpsed.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Sanitation Undertaking of the Capital <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Huizi</p>
<p>Among the sanitation undertakings of the capital, the Central Hospital must be ranked as the colossus. The building materials for the wards were purchased from the United States. All operating expenses require one million yuan, which is organized by the Ministry of Health. Although the scale is large, the results are not good because the hospital has a very harsh rule: it does not accept serious cases. For example, tuberculosis is not incurable, yet it is also forbidden to be admitted. This causes much dissatisfaction among the people.</p>
<p>This year, cholera has spread very seriously in Nanjing. The number of people who die from typhoid fever each year accounts for almost sixty percent of the city's mortality rate. The Ministry of Health shirks its responsibility to the Municipal Health Bureau. Since the abolition of the Municipal Health Bureau, speakers all say that the Ministry of Health should be responsible. However, the spread of infectious diseases has become like a prairie fire. Alas, how lamentable! It is found that the allocated funds for epidemic prevention from the Famine Relief Fund and the Boxer Indemnity are no less than two million yuan for Nanjing alone. I wonder where this money is used.</p>
<p>The highest medical organ in the military is the Army Medical Department of the Ministry of Military Administration. It has achieved considerable success in handling the recuperation of wounded soldiers. There are many people who are jealous of the broad scope of the military medical field. They all want to seize a position in the Army Medical Department, but military medicine is a specialized field that cannot be accessed by ordinary doctors. Therefore, they cleverly establish titles and interfere under various pretexts. For example, the former Military Medical Supervision Department and the current Military Medical Design Supervision Committee are all motivated by jealousy. Thus, they spare no expense to waste national funds on these redundant measures. We can discuss matters impartially. Personnel can be moved, but the agency should not be changed. If the Director of the Army Medical Department is not handling things properly, then just replace him with a good director. Why set up a similar agency outside of an existing agency? Such as the Military Medical Supervision Committee in the seventeenth year, the Military Medical Supervision Department last year, and the Military Medical Design Supervision Committee this year. All of these are cleverly established titles, which only give rise to sighs of divergent political orders and criticisms of redundant structures. They are established and abolished suddenly, without any basis. This is simply treating national affairs like child's play. (No remuneration)</p>

In his spare time, he has a great love for calligraphy and painting, and is especially skilled in writing and drawing with a steel pen like a willow branch. Recently, saddened by the domestic warfare and widespread natural disasters, he is using his summer vacation time to create one hundred pages of calligraphy and painting fans. Each page is valued at two yuan, and all proceeds will be used for disaster relief. The general collection point is the gatehouse of Huizhong Middle School, Ximenwai Xieqiao, Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e188">A Record of Longing for the 19th Route Army <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Jingqing</p>
<p>The Shanghai United Association of Patriotic Organizations held a farewell banquet for the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army at the Great China Hotel the night before last. Toasts and cups were exchanged, and the hall was filled with people. The seating arrangement was in a mountain shape. The central chairman was Sun Bolan, an elder statesman of the Kuomintang. Although his hair was gray, his spirit was robust. On his left and right were Army Commander Cai and Brigade Commander Weng, among others. Their heroic appearance and spirit were admired by all. Their sincerity was unadorned, and their resolve was firm and refreshing, which was admirable. Their heroic discussions amazed the audience, proving that their reputation as famous generals was not unfounded.</p>
<p>During the banquet, Army Commander Cai gave a speech, saying that he would never forget the united assistance of the people of Shanghai. Even though the area was devastated, the people showed no resentment towards our army and people, and they mistakenly adopted false praise and over-praised us. His humility and deference were evident in his words. Brigade Commander Weng's words were mostly gentle. In conclusion, he said that the 19th Route Army retreated because it was exhausted of ammunition and lacked reinforcements, not because it did not resist. He hoped that the central government would consolidate the national defense of Fujian Province and pay attention to the air force. Staff Officer Qiu's words were very passionate and mournful, and he also cut sorrowful pears, which was quite appropriate.</p>
<p>That evening, a reporter asked Army Commander Cai whether it was true that the Communist Party in Fujian had heard that the 19th Route Army was coming and was willing to lay down their arms and cease fighting to show their respect. Army Commander Cai replied that it was hearsay and not worth paying attention to, which was also very touching. However, during the joyous banquet, there was still a sense of sadness and longing. Those who sincerely defended the country and were willing to sacrifice themselves were retained by the masses, who feared their departure. They only knew that the barbarians were fighting each other, exhausting the people to their advantage, and they were condemned by all. They only feared that they would not leave, and some even criticized them for being reckless and missing opportunities. This was also with ulterior motives and not worthy of emulation. From beginning to end, not a single arrow was added. The so-called long-term resistance, the entire plan was based on flawed assistance from Wang Shen, and the restraint was further met with setbacks. Even if Sima Yi exhausted his wisdom, it was difficult to resist Zhuge Liang's wooden oxen on the Wei River, eventually leading to defeat on all sides and failure. This is what is meant by Jingwei (a mythical bird) holding a grudge, unable to fill the sea of hatred.</p>
<p>These are difficult times, and worries fill our hearts. The scorching summer boils, and gatherings are not yet over. In the past, the famous gentlemen of the Eastern Jin Dynasty gathered at Xinting for a banquet. Looking around, they sighed and said, "The scenery is the same, but the mountains and rivers are different." They all looked at each other and shed tears. Only Wang Dao changed his expression and said sternly, "We should all work together to support the imperial family and restore our divine land. Why should we act like captives facing each other?" How is this banquet different from the banquet at Xinting? The invasion is deep, and the disaster is imminent. If we think of the loss of the Northeast, the ashes of Shanghai, and the lonely widows and bones of the fallen soldiers, the cyan pity and the blue blood, without having to present them to our eyes one by one, it should be like the strings of the door, weeping before playing. This is also lamenting the approach and unable to restrain oneself. Now the 19th Route Army is leaving, embarking on a long journey, their spirit like clouds, one journey reviving the summer, which is what we look forward to. From here on, moss marks and duckweed shadows, horse bellies and long whips, what year will the hostel and the hall, the turban and the seats share together? We look south, with endless longing.</p>

<p>Chapter Eleven: Paying Homage to the Military Standard in a Remote Town; A Crowd of Sordid People Follows the Groom</p>
<p>Fortunately, everything went smoothly. It served that old dog right to stumble into my hands. I found a Councilor Hu, who got along very well with Master Ye. From the side, he heavily pressured the old dog. Commander Qi approved my petition and specially sent Councilor Hu to investigate him. It just so happened that I was also working on Commander An's side at the same time. I then earnestly brought An and Hu together. I arranged for everyone to come together, using Commander An's few guns to boost Councilor Hu's prestige. Was I still afraid of not knocking that old dog down with one blow? Once the old dog fell, An and Hu both had a lot of influence in the province and would be able to maneuver Councilor Hu into succeeding to the vacant county position. In the future, when Councilor Hu took office, Commander An would still be here handling the pacification. Wouldn't it be much easier to work together both internally and externally? What would we need that old dog for? Look at my good plans. Weren't they cleverly planned? I'm worthy of being a good strategist and a top-notch chief of staff. However, after squeezing out that old dog, I no longer deigned to do my old business. Instead, it truly became an open and selfless act of justice, eliminating harm for the local area and leaving rice for the general gentry. Now I've told you, but you must keep the secret for me temporarily. Don't let the old dog find out and start another trick. After hearing this, the group of people stuck out their tongues, praising the Fourth Master Wu's brilliant and powerful means, and swearing to God that they would never leak even the slightest bit of information. The more Fourth Master Wu spoke, the more frantic he became. He even boasted that even if the old dog got the information, it wouldn't matter. I've already cast a net of heaven and earth. I'm not afraid that he has any great magic powers to escape my palm. Who would have known that too much talk would ultimately lead to a loss? In the end, Li Pinzhai didn't suffer his immediate loss. Among these thousand people, there was one who was actually following Li Pinzhai's instructions, specifically to scout out the news of his great opponent, Wu Jinlu. After eliciting the true information, he flattered Fourth Master Wu again and then arranged to leave with everyone, going to the county office to report secretly that night. Now, let's put aside the situation on both sides of the county office and the hostel for the night, and briefly explain how An Yutian came to Haiding County with this group of people with such great power.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Foreign Interest Rates Reappear at New Low Price <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Six Fen Eight Li Eight Hao and a Half</p>
<p>Vigorous Settlement of Securities Transactions In the morning market yesterday, because it was the settlement period for this month's securities trading, those who need to deliver goods must use spot silver to make up the difference. Under normal circumstances, when the long and short positions are evenly balanced, there will always be some buying and some selling, so the difference between the supply and demand of silver is limited. However, now, due to the current situation and the most intense price declines, short selling is not speculative. Therefore, there are only long sellers coming out, and silver continues to gather more and more. Even if the interest rate does not decline, it is difficult to stabilize, let alone when it is weak. Therefore, yesterday's interest rates in both markets appeared at new low levels, which is truly an unprecedented sight of giant drops.</p>
<p>Interest Rates Fall and Money Lending Also Loosens The "foreign interest rate" had already passed the nine-fen mark in the early morning, at six fen eight li nine hao, causing great panic. The afternoon market continued to soften further, dropping another half a li to six fen eight li eight hao and a half. As a result, the total drop in both markets was one li and six hao and two and a half points compared to the previous day. The "silver lending rate" opened at one fen in the early morning, only slightly down by two points compared to the previous day. The afternoon market dropped another two points, to only eight points, and the situation was very weak. Therefore, adding water, the lending rate was only six or seven points. The bank's listing price was six fen four.</p>
<p>Small Silver Coins Are Flat and Weak, Copper Coins Greatly Increase Jiangnan small silver coins were the same in the early and afternoon markets, at five fen nine li seven hao, with no difference compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was also small, only two thousand jiao. However, Guangdong small silver coins seemed to rise in the early market, to five fen eight li four hao and a half, but seemed to soften again in the afternoon market, to five fen eight li eight hao and a half. As a result, the situation was still weak, but still better than the previous day by one hao and two points and a half. The transaction volume was 180,000 jiao in the early market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins actually rose repeatedly, reaching 428,000, a novel price never seen before. The transaction volume was 45,000 strings, weak.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Silver Collection and Settlement Are Both Extremely Busy "Silver": Yesterday's silver collection and settlement, the bank's settlement was still large, as it was the end of the first half of the year, which meant there were large volumes of inflows and outflows. Chinese merchants collected and settled drafts for 2.4 to 2.5 million, foreign merchants collected and settled drafts for 2.7 to 2.8 million, telegraphic transfers were 800,000, and the total settlement was 6.7 million. Various goods, taxes, and miscellaneous items amounted to 9.3 to 9.4 million. Out of the warehouse were 1.2 million. Money shops and silver firms settled over 27 million, and "added interest" settlement was 4.7 to 4.8 million. Various remittance routes amounted to over 900,000, and cash collection was over 1 million. "Foreign Silver": The early market for foreign silver drafts and remittances was 1.385 million, and the afternoon market was 920,000. The early market for banknotes was 40,000, and the afternoon market was 50,000. The off-market banknote trading was 70,000 in the early market and 95,000 in the afternoon market. The bank's drafts were 55,000 in the early market and 50,000 in the afternoon market. The early market interbank trading was 1.2 million, and the afternoon market interbank trading was 850,000. Foreign exchange collection and settlement by various banks amounted to over 3 million. Banknote inflow and outflow was over 2.2 million. The money shops' settlement was over 9.4 million, and "added interest" settlement was 3.4 to 3.5 million. Interbank lending amounted to over 3 million. Small money shops traded 800,000 to 900,000.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Fluctuations in Premium Not Weak <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Trend Seems to Be Advancing Yesterday's premium fluctuated significantly, with an upward trend, with over seven taels returning. The total continued to rise by about two taels. The inflows and outflows of various shops were irregular, and statistics showed that demand exceeded supply. It opened high and then weakened, once breaking 750 taels. However, as the US dollar appeared tight, it turned缓, and short covering came out. Banks were still able to buy in, and because of the bullish sentiment on the table, it suddenly showed sharp growth. The afternoon market was flat, and the later market was scarce because it was Wednesday and the foreign exchange market lacked activity. The price hovered around 53 to 54 taels, and the situation was very stable. The details of the whole day are recorded below.</p>
<p>Extremely Popular at One Point in the Morning The opening price for August added one tael and two qian, to 753 taels and eight qian. Although the US silver suddenly changed, private telegrams showed a decrease of one-eighth, and the large bar fell by one-sixteenth. The exchange rate was slightly lower, and the public sentiment seemed firm. Then it became 54 taels and five, and buyers were active. Unexpectedly, many retail long positions came to sell, causing the price to fall. In addition, the US dollar was not tight, but instead loosened. August could settle at 75. By 9:30, it was only 52 taels and two qian. HSBC's listing price remained unchanged. At this time, the stance was set, and then it added about four or five qian. The internal was loose again, and the English gold of September was done against 1.78125, and the US dollar of November initially sold at 125, but it was difficult to sell, and it had to be 25. Moreover, each number, such as Fuyu, Hengyu, Zhaofeng, Changyi, Yufu, Taitai, Henghong, Kangyong and goods, etc., were sold off. In an instant, five taels and zero were cut off, with only a few qian up and down in between. At 10 o'clock, it suddenly became 47 taels and a half. In a moment, Citibank went bankrupt, especially Huabi absorbed US dollars in November 25, and HSBC absorbed 1.875, and the recent 6875 was available for sale. Also, Fuyu, Hengyu, Hongkang, Yongbing, Xinghua, Changxiang, Yuanheng, Fengyong, etc., came on the market to buy, jumping three taels. After 10:15, it returned to 50 taels and added more than one tael. At 10:30, it was 51 taels and four qian, with no progress in half an hour. At this time, retailers sold, returning a small tael, and after 10:45, it was heard that US dollar 125 was available for sale. It was also rumored that Yufeng Yong was represented by other numbers, so it was a set of US dollars. Also, Fuyu, Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongheng, Changyong, Hongkang, Yongyuan, Maoyong, etc. competed to buy, so the market price soared and continued to rise by five taels. At 11:20, it was 55 taels, and there was no turning back. In one go, the US dollar in October settled at only 30 yuan, although it was issued by Guangdong Bang, it was not moved. However, by 11:45, it had retreated slightly by two taels, counting 53 taels. By the close of the market, it was three taels and a half, and it was slightly suppressed again by four or five qian. The goods made a small three qian.</p>
<p>A Quiet Situation in the Afternoon The afternoon market opened at 53 taels and one qian, followed by three taels and seven qian. There were slightly more sellers, still three taels and one qian. After 2:20, it seemed to be rising, so Hongkang Yongzhifeng Yongzhao Fengchang Yuanmaoyong bought, so it added more than one tael. However, from 2:30 to 3:45, there were only a few qian returns. Near 4 o'clock, it was 54 taels and six qian. Dalian Bang and sporadic long positions came out slightly, suppressing it by one tael. At 4:10, it was three taels and six qian. Then Yuanmaoyong goods Yifeng Yong came to drag in, and it was heard that the speculator Wu bought, and it rose one tael in an instant. By the 4:30 close, it was 54 taels and five qian, which was higher than the day before by one tael and nine qian. Then it was raised to five taels, and the goods made a big three qian. According to the full day's maximum of 55 taels, and the minimum of 47 taels and five qian, there was a difference of seven and a half taels. It also added ten taels in one stroke, and the swap was evened out.</p>
<p>The Opening Price Was Pressed to 65 or 66 Taels The opening price was not changed in the US</p>
<p>dollar listing price, so it was still 820 taels, which was a press of about 70 taels. At noon, it was 65 or 66 taels, and in the afternoon, it was 65 or 66 taels, which was about two taels less than the day before. The registration factory was 59 taels in July, 54 taels in August, and the water supplement was 59 taels. In the afternoon, it was 60 taels.</p>
<p>Active Trading in the Industry The trading on the table was still diligent, and the buying party generally dominated. According to statistics, Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu, Fuyu, Bingxing, Yuanxingyong, Yifengyong, Hongkangyong, Daxingyong, Zhaofengchang, Qianchangxiang, and Tongchun all went in. Zhifengyong, Yuantai, Wanxing, Tongtaichang, and Yuhe inflows and outflows were mixed. Hengxing, Yifeng, Shunli, Futaiheng, and Yuandayong all went out. The goods were set in and out of the head without a fixed price. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong, Zhaofengchang, and Hongkangyong Yifengyong all went in. Hengxing, Shunli, Yuanxingyong, and Hengyu all went out. The number was not large. Because there was no set head on Wednesday, the rest of the numbers were also slightly traded, and the checked amount was about 19,000 or more, which was slightly more than the previous day's report.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Stable Foreign Exchange Market Conditions <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>

The actual transaction price of the banks has shifted from weakness to stability, without significant fluctuations. Although the price of gold fluctuated by more than seven taels, it ultimately rose slightly. By the close of the morning session, the British and American exchange rates showed no significant difference compared to the previous day. Transactions in various currencies were limited, with only a few transactions in British gold. Banks made a small number of interbank transactions in US dollars, amounting to about 560,000 yuan. Zhifeng, Yong, and other firms sold forward contracts and hedged back into gold, with hedging prices within about 40 taels. Occasionally, a few companies settled recent contracts, showing firm market sentiment. There was no market in the afternoon due to the customary Wednesday closure.</p>

<h3 id="e195">New York Stock Market Shows Mixed Performance <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Report from American Eastern Bank: The New York stock market fluctuated, as many companies announced dividend news that day, causing market shifts. Due to the mixed performance of various stocks, the average price did not fluctuate significantly. After the market opened, news that the "General Foods" dividend was reduced from three dollars to two dollars caused the market to weaken. Fortunately, the news that "American Can Company" would pay dividends as usual revived market sentiment. Near noon, "Allied Chemical &amp; Dye Corporation" also announced that it would pay dividends as usual, further strengthening the market. Industrial stocks rose by an average of several points as a result. Railroad stocks were significantly affected by the suspension of dividends by the "Erie Railroad Company." Utility stocks remained stagnant, as did government bonds. Due to the stalemate at the Lausanne Conference and poor news from Chicago banks, market sentiment was chaotic, and there was a risk of further declines during the day.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Cotton Yarn Market in a Weakening Process <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yarn Exchange Closed Tomorrow for One Day: The cotton yarn market continues to weaken, with the situation worsening. Factories are accumulating increasing stockpiles. Given the domestic economic situation, which is depleted and unsustainable, the livelihood of the people is difficult, and yarn sales are very concerning. Furthermore, credit is extremely tight, and some yarn factories, in order to find a way out, have to sell forward contracts to protect themselves from risk. As a result, the July yarn market is increasingly pessimistic. Rumors circulated in the market that Tianjin Hua Yarn had several thousand bales transported to Shanghai for standard delivery, causing panic. Long Xing bulls remained quiet. The future of the yarn market is extremely bleak.</p>
<p>Man-Mark Market Continues to Weaken: The opening of the Man-Mark market was stable due to stable American cotton prices, but selling pressure remained strong, with prices falling by 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05 yuan for each month. In the afternoon, small investors bought to cover short positions, and prices rebounded by 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06 yuan for each month. The total transaction volume for the month was 34,300 bales. Changfeng sold 1,250 bales, Yi Da sold 650 bales, Yuanda sold 800 bales, Jifeng sold 600 bales, and Yukang sold 500 bales. Yukang bought 650 bales, Gengfeng bought 1,000 bales, Hengde bought 1,150 bales, Mingde bought 1,350 bales, Tonghe bought 600 bales, and Yihe bought 550 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Man-Mark | Closing Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>| ------- | ------------- | ------ | --------- |</p>
<p>| October | 1393        | -1     | 67,450     |</p>

<p>| September | 1394        | +3     | 54,900     |</p>
<p>Progress in Clearing Spot Yarn: There was more activity in clearing spot yarn. Total purchases by various groups throughout the day were 1,200 bales. 37 bales were purchased by peers, 270 bales were purchased by Guangdong buyers, 30 bales were purchased by Shantou buyers, 20 bales were purchased by domestic buyers, 42 bales were purchased by Ningbo buyers, 290 bales were purchased by Yunnan buyers, and 500 bales were purchased by Sichuan buyers. Prices fell by 0.05 yuan to 0.10 tael.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Cotton Market Trending Higher <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>General Cotton Merchants Expect Prices to Rise: The cotton market is stable, as American cotton shows signs of stabilization. Speculators are scarce, so transactions are relatively light, and most expect prices to rise, as domestic cotton is cheaper than foreign cotton. It is expected that there will not be sufficient deliveries in July, so bulls are considering a short squeeze. Market sentiment suddenly tightened in the afternoon, and the market speculated that Japanese merchants intended to purchase domestic cotton, raising the price of Chinese cotton and putting Chinese factories in a difficult situation. As a result, buying sentiment increased, and the market rose sharply. However, reviewing the American cotton market, it remains weak and sluggish, and foreign cotton remains cheap. There is no reason to abandon the cheap and choose the expensive, except perhaps for using Chinese cotton for blending purposes. Furthermore, after the Shanghai Incident this year, Japanese factories suspended work for three months. Last year, American and Indian cotton were purchased in large quantities, and there was a surplus that was resold to Shenxin Factory, but the factory was unwilling to accept it for some reason.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Up 0.04 and 0.05 Yuan: The opening of the Zheng Standard market was flat due to the weakening yarn market and flat American cotton prices. The second session rose by 0.005 yuan, and in the afternoon, rumors suddenly emerged in the market, and buying sentiment tightened again, with prices rising by 0.03 and 0.04 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 31,900 dan. Dafeng sold 2,200 dan, Gengfeng sold 1,100 dan, Xiesheng sold 1,600 dan, Yuchang sold 1,100 dan, and Yicheng sold 800 dan. Jifeng bought 2,900 dan, Shenchang bought 1,300 dan, Changhe bought 2,900 dan, Changfeng bought 2,700 dan, and Tongxing bought 1,200 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Zheng Standard | Closing Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>| ------- | ------------- | ------ | --------- |</p>
<p>| October | 2880        | +0.040 | 154,000     |</p>

<p>| Total   |             |        | 493,600    |</p>
<p>Mediocre Cotton Demand: The spot cotton business is still mediocre. The source is estimated to be 844 bales of Yaohua cotton.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton: 28.00 yuan, Yufeng purchased 400 pieces and sent them to the factory.</p>
<p>Yuyao Cotton: 24.85 yuan, Yongyu purchased 1,700 bales and sent them to the factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed. It was weak at first due to profit-taking by bulls, but then recovered slightly due to spot traders buying. Futures prices fluctuated by 1 to 3 points. Spot prices were unchanged. British cotton futures fell by 1 point, while spot prices rose by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegraph report is as follows (dated the 28th):</p>

<h3 id="e199">Sudden Rise in Grain and Rice Market <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, fewer than ten ships arrived from various groups. Sales in the city became more active as the Lesser Heat solar term arrived. Changshu and Northern Jiangsu Japonica rice and Suzhou Tong rice were expensive by 0.10 and 0.20 yuan. Pingwang Lai Japonica rice also rose by a dime due to stable opening prices, scarce arrivals, and thin inventory. Qingpu, Zhujing, and Liantang low-grade early and late rice were not selling well, so the market remained stable. Luyang Top grade arrivals and sales were balanced, and the market remained stable.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, the weather turned sunny, and the source from the west road was limited. Transactions in the city were not smooth, but the market stabilized. The prices of Suzhou Changzhou Japonica and Zhongguan fluctuated by a few cents. The inventory of Thin rice was extremely shallow, and buyers were flat, so prices were slightly firm by half a cent. Yang tip rice sales were a little better. Dujian rice was lacking in arrivals. A telegram arrived from Annam the day before, stating that the order for foreign rice could arrive in Shanghai in about ten days.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Tianjin Group Actively Handles Small Grain Rice <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Continued Handling in Inland Hankou: Yesterday's foreign rice market initially had good sentiment due to the continued handling in Zhenjiang and inland areas the day before. Furthermore, inland groups handled 2,000 bags, and village main streets and Hankou handled 300 to 500 bags each, and the market immediately turned around. In the afternoon, the Tianjin group arrived in the market and actively handled small grain rice, making the market even more active. Since the price of foreign rice fell, various groups have been trying to handle it. The Tianjin group had previously tried to handle several hundred bags and had already settled the accounts, so they handled it smoothly yesterday. If such batches continue to arrive in Tianjin smoothly, and if a large number of 300,000 to 500,000 bags can be sold, then the market price can rise step by step to 0.50 yuan and 0.70 to 0.80 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 8,500 bags of small grain rice were opened, with more than 5,000 bags going to Tianjin, 2,000 bags going to inland areas, and 300 to 500 bags each going to the main streets of the city and Hankou, priced at 9.65 yuan to 9.40 yuan. In addition, 100 bags of Wenzhou coarse rice went to the main streets of the city, priced at 8.50 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e201">July Flour Breaks Through 80 Cent Mark <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: After the opening in the morning, the market for various months was initially quite stable. As the quotation for foreign wheat had improved by about 0.10 or 0.20 yuan, there was not much fluctuation compared to the closing price the day before. However, in subsequent sessions, due to the scarcity of buyers (the price of wheat in Wuxi was close to only 5 yuan), the factories slightly reduced their offerings, causing the market to be sluggish and to decline step by step. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere suddenly changed dramatically. Because the country was in the new wheat season, the opening price was lower than in previous years, and a kind of pessimism was being avoided. Unfortunately, the selling of foreign wheat continued unabated. It was heard that Xiangmao handled Australian white wheat, and the factory sold a ship, priced at only 2.722 taels. With this significant pressure, the factory sales surged, and the market atmosphere declined sharply. The July price even broke through the 80 cent mark, the lowest record in the last three to five years. As a result, the prices for July and August fell by 0.025 yuan compared to the day before, the price for September fell by 0.0275 yuan, the price for October fell by 0.0325 yuan, and the price for November fell by 0.03 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Wheat Futures Prices Fall Frequently <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market: After the opening in the morning, the market for various months was relatively stable as the quotation for foreign wheat improved by 0.10 or 0.20 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere was already soft, and sales were brisk. Customers from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and the area north of the Yangtze River frequently sold due to the low price of spot wheat and the poor market for foreign wheat. Such factual sales were not to be taken lightly. Later, as the flour market fell sharply, the market atmosphere became more sluggish, and it was feared that the subsequent situation might continue to decline. As a result, the price for July fell by 0.04 yuan compared to the day before, the price for August fell by 0.03 yuan, and the prices for September and October fell by 0.02 yuan, the price for November fell by 0.01 yuan. The spot wheat market was slightly softer because the supply in the producing areas was easing and arrivals were surging. Kaihengjing wheat was priced at 2.922 taels, then 2.885 taels. Zhitang wheat was priced at 2.722 taels. Penglai wheat was priced at 2.888 taels, then 2.878 taels. There were a total of more than 2,700 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Sugar Market: Indonesian Red Sugar Trending Upward <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Coarse Granulated White Sugar Market Stagnant: Yesterday, the Shanghai Sugar Exchange market was relatively quiet. The asking price for Indonesian No. 24 Coarse Granulated White Sugar was 14.20 taels, and the asking price for Hong Kong sugar was 14 taels, but the number of buyers was small, and the price being offered was low. Many sellers continued to resist lowering prices, leading to a stalemate. Due to few transactions, the market was only stable. Indonesian No. 9 was priced at 10 taels and was quite popular. Taikoo Refined C.W. Mark was 15.75 taels, D.Y. Mark was 15.55 taels, H.X. Mark was 15.30 taels, H.M. Mark was 14.90 taels, and H was 12.40 taels. The market was strong. A brokerage sold 1,000 bags of Indonesian Red Sugar Nos. 8 and 9 at 10 yuan. At the same time, another brokerage also sold 501 bags at the same price. Brokerage interest was strong, so the market was extremely firm.</p>

<p>Only Grade B Products from Shangshen Fazhuang Are Replenished: Recently, medium-grade Shanghai White Factory Silk Products from Fazhuang have occasionally been purchased in small quantities. Unfortunately, the prices being offered are not high, and there are no large transactions. In order to clear out old stock and settle mortgages, manufacturers have not hesitated to sell at a loss. Yesterday, Xinfu and Dachang purchased 30 packages of Shanghai White Factory Silk Products from Shangshen's Grade B top-ranked products with 13 to 15 filaments, priced at around 600 taels. American sales remain stagnant. Grade A top-quality factory products remain unnoticed.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Marseille Long Silk Waste Breaks 10 Francs <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Silk Factory Long Silk Waste Only Offered at 9.5 Francs Per Kilogram: Marseille, France, is the central market for the distribution of silk cocoon byproducts from various countries. Top-grade silk waste from China and Japan is imported through Marseille and then transshipped to various ports. Recently, Japanese silk waste (i.e., silk head byproducts) has been sold off cheaply in Marseille, and prices have been offered upon request. As a result, our country's silk heads have been almost completely encroached upon, and market prices have plummeted. Silk factory long silk waste has broken below 10 francs per kilogram. White long silk waste (i.e., products from Jiangsu and Zhejiang) is only offered at 9.5 francs, while yellow long silk waste (i.e., products from Sichuan and Shandong) is only around 8 francs, a decrease of 45% compared to last summer.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Gongxi Green Tea Sales Slightly Active <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market in Shanghai, Gongxi Green Tea from the Wuyuan East Road, Baiduzhuang, Qianyi, and Yulong and other companies were all actively being handled, and the market appeared slightly active. Needle, eyebrow, and shrimp eye teas continued to be sold upon arrival, and prices were firm. Low-grade treasures, Jinlong, Shideng, and other companies were also actively searching for them. However, although merchants discussed and inquired about prices for medium and high-grade goods, transactions remained few due to the firmness of the Chinese merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Hardware Tinplate Supply Slightly Meets Guangdong Demand <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>There has not been much progress in the recent tinplate trade. Because the goods purchased by customers last time have not been sold, and the decorations made by local manufacturers are few, the market is quite quiet. However, due to the approaching year-end accounting period, foreign firms are throwing out spot goods one after another, causing the overall market to decline. The government's Construction Committee's inventory is also being released at this time, so there is enough stock in the market to supply sales for seven or eight months. As a result, people are very afraid, and the standard is declining step by step. For example, British 90-pound goods are sold for 9.75 taels, 100-pound goods are sold for 11 taels, American 90-pound goods are sold for 11.12 taels, and 100-pound goods are sold for 14.25 taels. The 200-pound Hui Company iron is sold for 21.5 taels, all of which are several cents lower than the previous market.</p>

<p>— Meng Tiao Zhu</p>
<p>His bold pen and clear talent cannot be matched in the capital. Who can compare to him besides San Yuan? He should be compared to the three peaks of Mount Hua. His lofty standard cannot be shaved off from the heavens. (Zheng Taiyi and Zhang Guangya once compared him to the three peaks of Mount Hua.)</p>
<p>Bozi's poetry is poor, but he is known for his good singing. He looks down on all the ministers with white hair. His poems are full of tears for the people. He is not like an autumn insect complaining unfairly. (Fan Bozi)</p>
<p>The completion of the basket extension has not exhausted his strength. He also passed on the poetry criticism to compress the mountain. He has always been interested in the school of thought. He kicked over the altar of the Qianlong and Jiaqing emperors. (Chen Shiyi)</p>
<p>Yellow caps and court clothes chase after the ministers. The summer is light without a ruler. You were originally a beautiful woman, but you fought to be a thief. Can you forget your feelings under the Wu Mountain? (Fan Fanshan had a sentence after the national change: "The summer is light without a ruler.")</p>
<p>Donglang chants his beautiful words at will. He seeks the shadow of the past in his dreams. In the tall buildings, there are bright moons and singing. The poet is in despair every night. (Yi Kouchang Qinzhi claimed to be Zhang Mengjin in his previous life)</p>
<p>When he wrote to the point that his blue shirt was wet with tears. How many people know of the Jiangzhou school of poetry? He laughs at the unique Yunmen melody. It is still poetry after Mei Cun. (Mr. Wang Buyun, the father of Yuanzhong, is most famous for Caiyun Tune. Commentators say that Fanshan's two songs are still like Mei Cun, while Mr. Wang's is like Changqing.)</p>
<p>He mourns the water fairy in the autumn soul of the golden well. The mourning cicada's voice breaks in the Han Palace. When should he put down the pen of a talented person? Ten thousand red lotuses pay homage to the white lotus. (Zeng Chongbo's Gengzi Fallen Leaves poem was written for Concubine Zhen and was widely circulated. When he climbed the Guanyin Rock of Mount Heng, he saw the precious mountain, pearl palace, and blue sky inserted with the sentence "Ten thousand red lotuses pay homage to the white lotus." I especially love it.)</p>
<p>He initially escaped the name of the Party imprisonment. He returned to a hut for the rest of his life. He tries out his dragon-slaying skills. The first sound of thunder shocks the ground. (Huang Gongdu)</p>

<h3 id="e209">Methods to Refresh a Straw Hat <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>As soon as summer arrives, the sun hangs high in the sky like a fiery umbrella. We must use straw hats to protect our heads. However, white straw hats are easily stained with dirt, and straw hats that are one or two years old often turn yellow, and the color is not bright. Wearing them is not elegant. Now let me introduce the method of refreshing straw hats to the public!</p>
<p>(A) Washing straw hats: Preparations: (1) Sodium carbonate (i.e. soda). (2) Sal Ammoniac. (3) Sulfur (4) A wooden box with holes (5) Soft brushes (6) Gum water (This is not necessary) With the above items, first use a soft brush dipped in Sal Ammoniac solution to wash the straw hat clean, then immerse it in sodium carbonate (Sodium Carbonate Na2Co3) solution (about one cup of sodium carbonate, two liters of clear water), then rinse it with clear water. Before it is dry, quickly hang it in a wooden box with holes, and then fumigate it with sulfur. After two hours, take it out and rinse it again with a diluted soda solution, then wash it with clear water, and hang it in a ventilated place to dry in the shade. At this time, the hat is as white as new. If it is a hard straw hat, apply a thin layer of gum water after drying in the shade, and rub it hard with a cloth towel after drying in the sun, and the luster will be radiant, which is no different from when you bought it.</p>
<p>(B) Brushing straw hats: This method is relatively simple. You only need to dissolve calcium hydroxide (i.e. slaked lime Calcium hydroxide Ca (OH) 2) in warm water, and use a soft brush to brush it carefully with water. After brushing it white, rinse it with clean water, and hang it in a ventilated place to dry in the shade. However, everyone must remember to avoid exposure to the sun.</p>
<p>The above methods of washing and brushing straw hats are all based on chemical principles. The reason why straw hats need to be fumigated with sulfur before they are dry is because sulfur burns in the air, that is, the sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas can bleach, because the acid produced when it meets water can reduce the color matter. From this point of view, fumigating straw hats with sulfur is actually the most important procedure in washing straw hats.</p>

<h3 id="e210">"Talent" Stops Here! <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>I remember in the autumn of last year, when Nanjing was busily preparing for the National Games, in order to make the venue solemn and majestic, a tall man named Chang Shude, who was eight feet two inches tall, was specially hired from Ji Hongchang's unit in Henan to guard the gate. At that time, I saw this news and wrote a humorous article called "Talent is Displayed" in a certain newspaper, and wrote the following crooked poem at the beginning:</p>
<p>"He is eight feet two inches tall, and he is frustrated; Once the opportunity comes, he will be a gatekeeper at the venue!"</p>
<p>The content was nothing more than talking to the tall man about many jokes and encouragement, pretending to use the present to prove the ancient; but the changes came, and there was no way to investigate. Since the September 18th Incident, the grand National Games has also dissipated into smoke! The "talent" of the tall man Chang Shude has still not been "displayed," so he is frustrated and almost unable to get a full meal, which is very pitiful!</p>
<p>Sure enough, "There is no need to worry about the usefulness of tall trees." The words of the ancients are true, and the huge advertisement of "Tall Man Chang Shude" suddenly appeared in front of my eyes! It turns out that the tall man has been recruited by the owner of the Great World, where he is "meeting the public."</p>
<p>In fact, this was also expected. Last year, I had already said that if the tall man has no way out, he might as well go to Mingxing Film Company to make a movie. Now the tall man does not appear on the screen, but shows his face in the Great World to be seen as a monster. Although the way out is different, the display of talent is the same.</p>
<p>Attracted by the power of the advertisement, I also spent two cents to admire this unique old tall man. When I stepped into the Great World and found the tall man on the third floor, the place of performance, I was disappointed again.</p>
<p>It turns out that the tall man cannot be seen for free. He is hidden in a small room, and another two cents for a ticket is required to appreciate his true face.</p>
<p>The tall man is also a "person." He also has eyes and a nose. It is said that besides being much taller than ordinary people, the rest is that he has a large appetite and can eat more rice than ordinary people. In addition, he has nothing else to offer.</p>
<p>However, the tall man is still a "living person!" So he can stir up people to go and see him. Otherwise, the Four Heavenly Kings of Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou are much taller than the tall man, so why doesn't anyone call them strange?</p>
<p>After seeing the tall man, friends who have not seen the tall man came to ask me, what is the tall man like? I said, "Talent stops here!"</p>
<p>Family Issues</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Old Man's Sorrow <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>Old Zhang from the village, everyone said he was a lucky man. Four sons, three daughters, and so many grandchildren and nephews around his knees. A family of more than twenty people eating together, such liveliness, such envy!</p>
<p>Indeed, Old Zhang was very lucky. He lacked neither money, with over a hundred thousand in assets, he was considered the richest in the countryside; nor lacked longevity, at sixty-five years of age; nor lacked children and grandchildren. He fully met the ancient three wishes: "many blessings," "long life," and "many sons." In the eyes of outsiders, he should be very satisfied, what more could he ask for?</p>
<p>But in the desolate old man's heart, feelings of loneliness often arose, bringing boundless vexation. The eldest son was an official outside, said to earn over ten thousand a year, but the family had never seen a penny from him. In the past, when he was studying, he would ask for thousands of dollars at a time, but during winter and summer vacations he would always stay at home for a few months. Now, he doesn't even think of coming back for a whole year; even if he does come back, he leaves after three or five days, saying he is busy with official business and cannot stay long. It's as if he's a guest here. Times have truly changed. The second son is doing business far away in Zhangjiakou and cannot return often. Although the third son is at home, he spends the whole day outside, either playing cards or drinking with friends. When he does come home, he sneaks straight into his wife's room and never even asks how his old father is doing. Alas, they are all getting old! The youngest son is still studying in Beijing, like his older brother in the past, constantly writing letters asking for money. As for the daughters, there are three of them, and they are all married now. The eldest daughter followed her husband to Hubei to become some kind of bureau chief, only sending a few letters a year, or a little local produce, and has not been seen for a long time. The second daughter resented the meagerness of her dowry, compared to her younger sister, and was angry with her mother, refusing to return to her parents' home even for one night. The youngest daughter has a shop at home and has to manage family affairs and take care of her children, making it difficult for her to return. Alas, they have all flown away, leaving only eight or nine children who cannot fly away, still circling around you, wanting to be held and fed, and are very close to you. But, when your wings grow, you will also have to fly away from me! Although there are more than twenty people in the family, I am living a lonely life in solitude. Who says I am luckier than old man Li next door? He has two sons and a daughter, all living in the village, helping him farm. Although the family is poorer, they are all together, seeing each other morning and night. That is what is truly enviable! Alas, times have changed.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Kneeling and Crying Delegation <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Guliang</p>
<p>Not long ago, various people's organizations in Tianjin, unable to deal with treacherous merchants who were trafficking in enemy goods, organized kneeling and crying delegations to set out separately and carry out kneeling and crying work. The goal was to warm the blood of the treacherous merchants, in the hope of achieving a unified effect of resisting the enemy. Although far away in Tianjin, closing our eyes and imagining it, the bitterness of their intentions and the desperation of their actions, this tragic feeling is enough for us to bear!</p>
<p>"Large quantities of Japanese goods are being imported," "Eastern goods are unusually active." In Shanghai newspapers, these records have recently often caught our eye. While enemy soldiers continue to massacre our compatriots, a portion of treacherous merchants have gone mad and are recklessly active! Under these circumstances, in order to alert the consciences of these treacherous merchants, it is very necessary to organize kneeling and crying delegations. We should all emulate the ten-day crying at the Qin court. We must cry to revive their hearts, cry to heat their blood. I think people are not made of wood or stone. When the nation is in imminent danger and their own deaths are at hand, they will certainly not remain indifferent!</p>

<h3 id="e213">For the Lookout <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News carried a piece of news the day before yesterday, roughly saying: "The Shanghai Municipal Council's fire department has set up the highest lookout post on the top floor of the Cathay Hotel, using telescopes to observe the entire city, which is very clear. Therefore, women bathing by the window in high-rise buildings should first lower the curtains."</p>
<p>The lookout post is for observing fires, not for observing women bathing. It's like comparing a horse's head to a cow's tail. Why involve women? Especially the sentence "should first lower the curtains" is the most incomprehensible. Whether women lower the curtains before bathing by the window has nothing to do with causing a fire. Public affairs are handled publicly, and private affairs are handled privately. Women bathing is a private matter, and observing fires is a public matter. The lookout watches the fires, and bathing is bathing. Not lowering the curtains is not to be seen by the lookout, but to ensure ample sunlight and prioritize hygiene. Is it possible that for the sake of a lookout, people should be prevented from maintaining their hygiene? I believe that the lookout is probably a romantic dandy, afraid that the lookout will see the beauty and forget to look out for fires, so this notice is issued, not for the sake of protecting women's dignity. Otherwise, why not say that men bathing by the window in high-rise buildings should also first lower the curtains?</p>
<p>This notice-style news seems not to have fully expressed its intention and should be changed to "Therefore, women bathing, changing clothes, and XX by the window in high-rise buildings should first lower the curtains." Because bathing should first lower the curtains, then why shouldn't changing clothes and XX?</p>
<p>Market News</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy Giveaway. The Wuzhou Pharmacy on Sima Road, recently, due to the irregular weather and the prevalence of epidemics, in order to promote hygiene and reward customers, has specially joined forces with the Tianhou Palace Bridge, North Sichuan Road, Xiaodongmen, and Penglai Market branches of Wuzhou in this city to hold a summer giveaway. All purchases of one yuan or more will receive practical gifts. Therefore, the retail departments of the pharmacy have recently been extremely crowded, and business is very brisk. The best-selling products are "Yalin Stink Water," "Liang Dan," "Mosquito Incense," and "Wuzhou Cologne."</p>
<p>Zhongxi Pharmacy's Low Prices. Since the Zhongxi Pharmacy on Sima Road started its low-price giveaway, retail and wholesale sales have been extremely crowded. The daily giveaway of "Mingxing Cologne" has reached over 10,000 bottles. Those from other cities who want to purchase "Mingxing Cologne" in large quantities must make advance reservations, as the number of wholesale customers is overwhelming. Although the pharmacy is rushing to produce it day and night, it is still in short supply. The sales of summer essential medicines, such as Baoming Shiyishui, have also surged, breaking the previous record for the highest sales in history. The pharmacy's low-price period ends at the end of this month.</p>
