<p>時評</p>
<h3>悼蕭特先生并慰蕭母彬</h3>
<p>美飛機師蕭特氏爲維護公理與和平於此次上海之禍變中。决然自動投效我軍。助我對日作戰。其言曰。「余本爲一中立國之人。但余眼見日機在不」宣而戰之戰爭中。不斷以炸彈轟炸男女老幼無辜之人。故不能再忍」不幸於二月二十三日在蘇州爲日機六架所圍擊。竟至焚死。吾人對於此見義勇爲爲維護正義而犧牲之義士。謹特表示深重之敬意與哀思。</p>
<p>蕭之慈母。爲葬其愛子。遠涉重洋。昨已蒞滬此白髮暮年之慈母目擊其慘死之愛子之遺體。老懷悲慟。自可想知。然而我人認爲蕭氏之死非若尋常之死。而爲維護正義與和平而死。爲光榮的死偉。大的死。其身雖死其偉大崇高之精神。實長劉人間。蕭母有子矣。雖失其子。抑又奚悲。視昨日成千成萬爲歡迎義士之慈母而齊集埠頭熱烈高呼之中國人民。即可知蕭氏之死已長留光榮於中國四萬萬人民之心曲。蕭母當亦可勉抑其悲思矣。吾人謹以誠意祝望蕭母善自珍重。</p>
<p>抑吾人有未能已於言者自去年東北禍變爆發以來國聯先後集會四次然面集全世界之外交家政治家於一堂。苦慮焦思。竟無以裁制强權維護正義。坐視和平被破壞。國際公約被蹂躪。而一籌莫展。以視蕭氏之激於正義投袂而起。與强權搏戰。竟以身殉。其相去誠不可以道里計。吾人認爲有蕭氏壯烈之死。益可以揭露國聯之懦弱無能。終始無裁抑强權維護正義之誠意與决心。</p>
<p>次之。日軍此次一手毁碎國際盟約蹂躪正義破壞和平而猶謂爲保僑爲維護正當權益。爲迫不得已。在其暴行荼毒之下。東北以及此次閘北江灣眞茹吳淞等戰區。已成荒凉一片。戰區災民。無辜死於砲彈者。不知凡幾而其流離失失之孤兒寡婦。更不知凡幾。誰實爲之。皆日軍暴行之賜也蕭氏以一美人。竟自動助我杭日。此非厚於我國。而實爲愛護正義。蕭氏之死。蓋已顯示日人之行爲决爲世界愛正義愛和平之人士所不容。抑且顯示正義之光芒决終非强權所可吞没。正義一日而存於世界。則世界亦必有無數之蕭氏爲反對强權維護正義而對侵略者嫉惡痛恨。午夫所指。無疾而死。武力果眞可恃乎。日人於此。最宜三思。</p>
<p>復次。我國養兵二百萬。年費國幣百分之八十以上。而外侮之來除去年馬占山所部以及此次十九路軍等極少數軍隊。自動奮起抗禦而外餘竟袖手旁觀。或則徒作長期抵抗之宣言。或則徒發枕戈待命之通電。有侮不能禦有土不能守。職責之謂何蕭氏以一外人而竟見義勇爲。慷慨犧牲我國失職之軍人。視蕭氏之死。更得不慚恧愧怍知所奮勉於今後乎。</p>

<h3>軍縮會通過逐步限制案</h3>
<p>草約第一欵修正文字　　國民十九日日内瓦電今晨軍縮大會總委員會、一致通過逐步限制與减縮軍備决議案、此案將編入軍縮公約第一欵、但今晨又稍經熱烈辯論、始行通過、足見各代表雖贊成此决議案、而基本觀念仍未全同、其中羅馬尼亞外相鐵工業斯科與蘇俄人民外交委員李維諾夫曾有最劇烈之舌戰、並對中途停頓俄羅不侵犯條約談判、互作解頤妙語、</p>
<p>國民十八日日内瓦電軍縮大會起草委員會、經美代表之建議、今日重行起草軍縮公約草案第一欵、其内容大致改爲國聯會章第八欵規定之减縮軍備、僅能於本屆大會開始前進一大步之後、每隔適當時間作累進之修改、始克完全成就、並規定普遍的减縮、應以事勢所可能之最低水平線爲趨向、現已有十二委員連俄·土·德在内、均接受此新條文、唯捷克與日本尚略有反對處、</p>
<p>路透十八日日内瓦電軍縮會議之總委員會、今日開始工作、德代表那杜尼博士聲稱、最重要者在實施會章第八條範圍内之軍縮、德國不能贊成俄代且李維諾夫所提出之機械式軍縮辦法、但可贊同其比例的縮减之原則云、各國代表見解逐漸相合、於是比·西·捷克·丹麥·挪威·愛沙尼亞與烏魯圭代表提出草議案、主張軍備縮减、逐步爲之、而常在可能的最短時期中修正之、此案爲各代表所接受、惟俄代表李維諾夫反對議案文中言及國聯、因蘇俄非國聯會員也、渠主張第一步在切實縮减、英代表西門贊成此案之原則、並謂、可用更爲切實之字句、以代「可能的最短時期」一語、因此語可爲人誤會也、</p>
<p>國民社十九日日内瓦電軍縮大會總委員會、今晨十時十五分開會後、即開始討論闡明軍縮會議目的之新决議案、旋即舉手表决、全體通過、但蘇俄與羅馬尼亞代表曾有劇烈爭辯、嗣羅馬尼亞·波斯·南斯拉夫·與阿根廷代表先後登壇、説明其贊成决議案、附有一種諒解、即此案與另一决議案有連帶關係、該案將規定軍備必須减縮至與國家安全相適合之最低限度、而國際務必須出以共同行動一致實行云云、蘇俄代表李維諾夫起而反對、力言國際會章下之義務、旣而各委員乃開始討論限制與縮减軍備之標準、應將各國特殊情形一併考慮、並以維持國内秩序所絕對需要、與保障國防所相對需要爲基礎而計算軍力、意外相格蘭第首先發言、堅持在進軍縮之第一時期、各國地理位置與鄰邦軍備狀况、必須加以考慮、日代表籐對於此種意見、表示異議、彼稱各國情形不同、不能以一標準、繩諸各國、故空軍限制一節、亦不能以一方式加諸各國、因有數國空軍尚未完備、足以與他國相比也云云、日本代表又稱、此次軍縮會議所期望成就之條約、應以國聯會章爲歸依、國聯會章對於軍縮問題之不完備者、因加以補救之云、中國代表劉文島繼起請求各國軍備應减縮最低限度、並應以各國領土之大小、爲軍縮大小之標準、劉氏復提及中國前此所提出之備忘錄、内稱、軍縮情形此後須視鄰國之有無侵略野心、如鄰國有和睦交誼、則軍備可較輕云、劉氏言至此、蘇俄代表李維諾夫即起立發言、謂「余不知」此種會議、何時可以完竣、亦不知何時可以開始實行、余但聞各國斤斤較量爭辯各種條件云云」、蓋俄代表已預示此次軍縮會議倘不採取蘇俄之議案、决難以成功也、當李維諾夫演説畢、譯員將翻譯時、美代表史汀生翩然戾止、時爲十二時十分、史氏即止於游廊與老友閑談、俟西班牙代表馬達利亞加演説畢、始入會塲、就坐於美代表吉伯生之座位、於是全塲目光皆轉而注意於史氏、各代表分往寒暄、嗣德代表那度尼與波斯代表阿拉先後演説、史氏則時就吉伯生耳語、有所詢問、並矚會塲人物、惟於法代表彭古演説、頗注意傾聽、最後主席漢德森乃推定起草委員會草擬減縮軍備標準之决議案、限星期三上午十時報告總委員會總委員會亦遂要會至星期三上午召集、</p>
<h3>李維諾夫否認赤軍集中邊境</h3>
<p>但時局嚴重確係事實</p>
<p>蘇俄無一窓洞</p>
<p>可任盜宼出入</p>
<p>俄報再致日本警告</p>
<p>國民十八日日内瓦電蘇俄人民外交</p>
<p>委員李維諾夫之發言人、今日切實否認東京所傳蘇俄增兵滿邊、及俄共黨炸毁東路致日兵車出軌等説、但謂時局嚴重、確係事實、吾人無從掩飾、日人及日本化之滿人刻正煽動白俄、滋生糾擾、惟吾輩當此危急時期、仍傾其全力、以維持嚴密之中立云、</p>
<p>國民十八日莫斯科電今日莫斯科已承認集中大兵於遠東邊境、及澈底準備國防、惟派往遠東之軍隊實數、則未發表、共産主義青年同盟之泊拉夫達報發一警告、聲稱、蘇俄非颟頇麻木、能在不知不覺中受人襲擊者、謂彼受人雇用之匪徒、應知蘇俄無一窗洞可以任盜賊出入而毫無危險者、蓋俄人目下觀察馬占山將軍之行動、另具一種目光、以爲馬氏係日人密嗾、陽稱反正、陰欲使日兵得以藉口屯聚北滿邊境、伺隙襲攻蘇俄而已、故蘇俄外部因海蘭泡中國領事代馬發電、有要求滿洲僞政府召回之舉、又共黨機關報伊斯凡斯的亞報對於哈爾濱白俄在蘇俄機關前示威行動、亦有激烈論調、鄭重聲稱、白俄之一再向蘇俄挑釁繼續不已、皆出日人之指使與縱容、日本當負其責、又稱、日報一致混淆黑白、欲使國人對於蘇俄之見解、發生誤會、所以對於蘇俄不許俄人加入遠東糾紛、及一切關於反俄誣蔑之否認等、皆始終不載一字、亦絕不稍加注意、顯欲在國民造成擴張軍事行動之輿論、導其人民入於新戰禍、又泊拉夫達報稱、蘇俄人民刻正在滿洲監獄中、受日人嚴刑虐待等語、致俄輿論更爲憤慨、</p>
<p>路透十九日倫敦電　倫敦各報今晨皆以甚大之字標題記日俄之關係、預料蘇俄屯軍邊界、及彼此猜疑之結果、將令雙方發生衝突、惟衆意日俄兩國今無一願作敵對行動、或因此不致臻危險之點、</p>
<h3>土耳其可望加入國聯</h3>

<p>東京朝日新聞載莫斯科電、蘇俄聯邦外交人民委員長李德維諾夫·與美國國務卿史汀生、在日内瓦非公式的會晤、雖未詳其内容、但世人均預測將來必發生重大的結果、莫斯科孫中山大學校長辣德克、寄函蘇俄聯邦機關報伊士威司却新聞、發表意見如下「予以日本最近對俄」</p>
<p>攻擊、間接的促成俄美同盟之必要、倘果實現、則日本之失敗、當在意料中、應將此皆警告日本、若日本再來挑戰、蘇俄聯邦、一時的不得不向資本主義强國中求同盟、目下全美反日感情甚熾、値此重大時期、日本對於紛爭圈外之大國、專採招致憤懣的行動、眞不識世界大勢、殆若瘋癲之暴徒、故際此危機、欲救日本之道、惟有與亞細亞鄰邦、友誼的協力、以抵制之也、」</p>
<h3>僞國之命運</h3>
<p>日軍在北滿漸無所恃</p>
<p>吉林軍將收拾僞吉軍</p>
<p>字林報九日哈爾濱通訊云、北滿道路崎嶇、運兵維艱、故派往中東鐵路東段與松花江下游之日步兵、殊無用武之地、舊吉軍熟諳地理、故其抵禦日軍、佔有種種便利、日軍近日之大遭挫衂、固意中事也、加以馬占山是否眞心歸嚮所謂新滿洲國、尚屬疑問、上星期馬氏與軍官數員、倐赴齊齊哈爾、日軍當局至以爲慮、恐馬此去、乃圖反正、而丁超之常與北平通無線電、亦經徴實、丁或尚與馬占山時通聲氣也、外間盛傳北滿華軍、現正華備再起攻擊日軍、此訊如確、則日軍不得不完全變更戰略、新吉軍來哈爾濱時、曾遭慘敗、並在其他各處大受損失、故該軍殊不可恃、日軍亦知其無用矣、今晨接訊、日當局擬將派往中東路東段之軍、全行調回、屯集於哈爾濱、或長春附近、果爾、則將放棄東段之盡端、而舊吉軍於是不難收拾新吉軍、實則今已有數處之新吉軍、響應舊吉軍、故其形勢、愈見嚴重、駐哈爾濱之日軍司令、日者突駕飛機赴瀋陽、齊齊哈爾之日軍司令、亦繼之以往、足證本莊將開特别軍事會議、討論應付方法、蓋今日之局勢、已完全與日軍初料者相反也、近數日内、日本由鐵路運到飛機多架、日軍顯以爲在北滿作戰、飛機之爲用、遠勝步軍、特不知春暖之後、滿洲森林、綠葉向榮、飛機自高下矚、殊難見敵軍之蹤跡、而華軍轉可利用濃蔭、密藏高射砲、以轟擊敵機、使敵機不能得目標以擲炸彈、據日報載稱、日本大飛愛國第五號、即因此被毁云、該機飛往松花江下游、向阿穆爾河進發、忽告失蹤、至今十日、音信杳然、或謂該機之駕機者、必誤以爲阿穆爾河乃松花江、致降落俄境、而爲俄人所拘、蘇俄軍事當局、對於一切舉動、向不洩漏消息、如該機確曾越過邊界、則自難向俄人方面探知其究竟也、中東鐵路之拒絕運兵、與道路之崎嶇、林木之向榮、此三者已令北滿局勢、大爲變動、而皆不利於日軍者也、今料四五月間、或將有重要性質之事變陸續發生、所謂新滿洲國之命運、恐不免大受影響也、</p>

<h3>紗花客銷滯金融緊現紗售價愈低落</h3>
<p>棉紗市况依然疲弱、且跌風仍熾、因各廠囤積漸漸增厚、而客銷滯鈍、金融奇緊、各方絕少生氣、致人心愈覺惶慮、市價急轉直下、大有每况愈下之勢、至於四方情形、異常困難、毫無暢銷之望、所以照實際上論之、前途難免有大降之虞也、聞日廠多數業已復業開車、華紗競敵尤多、查全日各帮買去統計五百包、同行中進一百十五包、行情跌五錢至一兩二錢半、十六支金鷄紗價已進六十兩關内、客帮汕頭進五十包、天津六十五包、四川八十包、寗波三十包、北帮七十五包、内地四十五包、江西五包、申新廠略有零碎開出云、</p>
<h3>申新吸棉量已有飽滿象</h3>
<p>棉花實銷較清、各廠辦意愈懈、因外棉狀况趨跌、形勢見弱、又有發現新低價之勢、因此各廠舉動又滯、惟由新廠雖有辦意、然近日吸收不少、已有飽滿之患也云、</p>

<h3>期洋米續有結</h3>
<p>昨洋米市况、暫居定局、貨主因産地市價高昂、不肯賤脱、而進戶祗本街尚有胃口、内地與客帮均無大批去化、故市面乃呈擯持之象、但期貨已無洋行續抛、售出之行號均有收回之意、故期貨市價、仍居挺勢、統市開出西貢一號現米一千包、價十一元三角至十一元二角半、小絞二千餘包、價十元零一角半至九元九角、期貨了結者有五月份一號西貢五百噸、價五兩三錢半、四月份敏當五百噸、價四兩九錢半、小絞五月份二百噸、價五兩○八分至五兩○五分云、</p>
<h3>現粉又呈疲乏</h3>
<p>昨現粉市面、又呈疲滯之象、一般無實力之買戶、因收貨之故、如不了結、前付之定銀、將被取銷、因此事爭先脱手、不顧行情、故四月份開價、即較前月低落一分、祗二兩一錢零五釐、後以賣戶仍暢、續小二釐半、五月份以人心尚佳、開價爲二兩一錢二分半、惟客戶心思、依然堅定、兼之廠方態度亦堅、故收價反爲二釐半、近日兵船去路稍懈、紅藍車以本街銷活、與兵船並價、砲台因貨多銷寂、祗開二兩零五六分、餘則與前相仿云、</p>

<h3>油市開市後之白桐油</h3>
<p>白桐油市面、本集中於漢市、故洋莊採辦咸趨於是、自一二八滬戰發生各處金融受絕大影響、漢市爲吾國百物雲集之地、控制南北、時局稍有變動、金融首當其衝、白桐油雖有國外去路、與其他貨物微有不同、然究難免除困難、故自滬戰未發生以前、售洋莊尚在廿一兩以外、嗣因滬上有戰事而停市、漢上洋莊交易亦因之斷斷續續、售價逐步下游、迨至近日、竟跌至十八兩矣、而其勢仍是萎靡不振、且洋莊交易、近二三年來、祗有數十噸及將百噸之少數生意、非若從前動輒三五百噸及千噸之大票交易、其對外貿易之衰落、於此可見、連日漢市消息均以洋莊十八兩爲正市、内銷批價售在十五兩光景、滬上自停市兩月、二十年度帳略、尚未結束、現雖忍痛開市、究其實營業仍在停頓之中、且須現銀交易、更非往常可比、故名雖開市、實與停市無二、本埠號家、因銷路不能發展、對於進貨、仍祗放棄、總須待時局完全平静、金融流通後、始有發展餘地也</p>

<h3>勉黑馬</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>臣嘗以黑馬徴對紅羊。以圖贊揚馬占山將軍矣。將軍以絕塞孤軍。守土戰日。殺傷過當。忠勇絕倫。於是英雄之稱。譽沸中外。蓋在蔡廷楷蔣光鼐兩將之先。是謂首功第一。尤難能而可貴也。不圖中間有忍辱欵敵之一段經過。邦人疑之。以爲軟化。今則有佳文兩電。事乃大白。信斯言也。豈獨壯繆歸曹。心原興漢。子房佐沛。志切存韓。昔伊尹五就桀。五就湯。孟子稱爲聖之任者。以其以天下爲已任。佐成湯之革命也。論世知人。綜觀言行。將軍乃心民國。百變不渝。則亦英雄而幾乎聖賢矣。方今横流滄海。全球有劇變之機。大好山河。中華無可亡之理。有君子其能國。唯多難以興邦。如將軍者。皎月浮雲。不礙太清之滓。疾風勁草。方知板蕩之忠。臣雖不文。將著爲黑馬列傳。附諸青史。張我黄人。將軍勉乎哉。</p>
<h3>愛國童子</h3>
<p>— 憶秋寄自吳中</p>
<p>日前經錢萬里橋。見橋旁人叢中。語聲鼎沸。余爲好奇心所驅使。趨前探視。見一中年婦人。手拉一童子。頻呼」你痴了。你痴了。」童則竭力掙扎。面向車站。口中頻呼「我要到崑山去」不已。聲極悲壯。而涕涙交流。觀者均爲動容。余加以探索。知係母子。童名沈琪。年十一。肄業於實騐小學。平時品學兼優。近以每日披閲報紙。知日人之横暴益甚。國土已日見動摇。於是此小小心靈。爲愛國熱潮激盪。忘却自身之年齡。遂矢志殺敵救國矣。先是有同學二人。年事均等。於前一日相約赴車站。欲搭車赴崑。投軍殺敵。詎候車不至。均爲家屬逼回。惟沈琪年雖幼。而志頗堅。翌晨。不復約二友。隻身離家。擬沿鐵道步行至崑。詎未抵車站。又爲家人所阻。以二次志不能遂。痛不欲生。其母則緊握其手。堅不放行。母子二人。乃相持於途中。此時余因要事他往。不知此後如何。噫。國難深矣。童子無知。尚憤激若是。不知彼袞袞諸公觀此。又作何想感也。</p>

<p>通知海泰的總指揮梁冠英。當奮勇抗日的十九軍退二道防線以後。聞日宼擬佔靖江作爲攻擊江陰要塞的根據地。梁總指揮聞訊。即在長江的沿岸籌防。苦於交通不便。就發下一道命令。「限四」天内完成通靖大道。」（由南通經過如臯）</p>
<p>而達靖江）遂由各區公安局及各鄉長副等召集沿途的民衆。曉諭暴日侵略的慘酷。請他們不分畫夜的工作。果然在一百小時以内築成了闊十八尺長一百數十里的橋樑數十座的大道。近來那風馳電掣般的汽車。已在往來巡邏。關於防務上。當然是不足憂慮了。梁總指揮的佈防敏捷。果然可嘉。而築路的民衆。在一百小時内努力不懈的精神。尤其是可佩。　　現在停戰會議是停頓了。什麽呈報國聯解决。這都是不可靠。如果在朝的人們。也如梁總指揮的一道命令。「限四天」内驅逐倭寇出境。」我想平時受國民豢養的將士們。决不致於按兵不動。或棄械逃跑吧。</p>
<h3>滬戰與軍器（十四）</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>飛機　自十七世紀末期。葡萄牙人瞿士幕與意大利人拉拏。創製汽球。法人施文在空中試演可停二十二分鐘。各國皆駭怪異常。傾注全力於航空事業。九○八年。德國伯爵徐柏林。發明了大汽艇。於是航空界遂一新面目。未幾。奥大利的凱土。意大利的那尼。英吉利的馬克司。美國的威克著孟法國的斐伯法孟富擴勒等。也相繼發明新機。至是歐美的航空事業。遂告大成。其後學術發達。機械進步。軍事上認爲唯一的利器。歐戰爆發。德國徐柏林飛機。脅迫聯合軍。倫敦巴黎。迭被襲擊。雖當時法國的Ｆartman式機。意國的Ｃaproli式機。英國的Ｈandly</p>
<p>Bage式機。都各有特長。然終不能敵德國的Ｇotba式飛機。因此轉戰六年。大受德國飛機之害。大戰後。航空問題。尤爲各國所注意。如發動機的進步。空氣抵抗力的减小。複葉式的變爲單葉式。各種機械材料的改良。以及無綫電報·炸彈·落下傘·觀測器·攝影機等的設備。一天天的完善了。其最顯著的。好像最近法國飛行家鮑司德羅氏。在非洲亞爾舍利阿地方。試演滯空旋回飛行。達到七十六小時四十三分。直線距離。約一萬六千基羅米突。竟破航空界的新紀錄。他若美國的佩蘭康單葉飛機。亦於去年横斷太平洋時。使用代舍爾發動機。能保持八十四小時的長距離飛行。聽説倘用另外飛機一架聯絡。供給軋司林。可以在空中飛行二十三日。本月初。俄國技師葛羅福司克。新造一飛行船。其時速達三百七十五基羅。前後装置發動機兩個。照這樣看來。航空的進步。眞不可思議呢。</p>
<h3>國仇家仇（一）</h3>
<p>— 王天恨</p>
<p>本來，這一夜！一二八之夜！是可以高枕而臥的！數日前那種情勢，十分緊張，鄰家遷避的很不少，鄭華爲了七十歲的老母，和十一歲的幼子雄，也有了遷避之意。但是到了二十八日市政府對於日人所提四條件完全屈服，緊張的情勢便緩和下來；並且報上還刊着日總領事表示滿意，更足爲緩和的證據。鄭華雖然憤恨，可是上海能免除戰爭，爲了老母和幼子，也就感覺到和體諒到上海市長這一種委曲求全，也實有不能不委曲之勢！他回頭見了母親的龍鍾老態；同時雄兒由外面跳躍而入，喊了一聲爸爸後，立刻奔到老祖母身旁，拉了老祖母的手喊祖母，老祖母笑迷了一雙老眼，注視雄兒的面，頓時使他身上發生了慈愛之電的感應，銷失了一腔憤怒。</p>
<p>「今夜可以高枕而臥了！」老母和幼子同宿；他自已獨宿在亭子間裏，十點鐘走進臥室時，還這樣想。他的妻在八年前就患病死了，雄兒是賴着祖母撫養長大的，所以雄兒一向都是隨着祖母睡。</p>
<p>突然聽得外面發生了異乎尋常的聲浪。他剛要睡着，却被這聲浪喚醒了。他絕不料到會在日總領事表示滿意的當夜，發生什麽變化。但是再一聽，竟大大不對。他很靈敏。忽忽穿好了衣服，走出屋來，弄堂裏已呈現非常狀態，人們慌忙逃走的喧雜，和弄外劈劈拍拍的聲浪，便顯然告訴他已發生戰事了！他又立刻奔出弄外，要探究竟。</p>
<p>不料弄外竟是漆黑，只見到隨着劈劈拍拍之聲而發現的火光，此外却什麽也不見。他頓時也慌張起來，再向前進，不遠便發現人影，同時忽有蚩蚩之聲，迭從耳畔掠過，他又立刻意識到這是子彈，不覺大驚，忙把身子伏在地上，匍匐前進，先前所見的人影，即來阻止，他纔曉得本國軍隊。槍砲聲忽又更密起來，從黑暗中四望，蠕蠕而動的人影，似乎很衆。槍砲聲旣密，嘈雜的人聲也更嘈雜，還夾着哭聲，他雖然嚴壯，也嚇得渾身冷汗。前面又顯然地不能進，只得轉了方向，匍匐回家；不料還未到弄口，已被一大堆的人阻了路。猛又聽得頭頂上軋軋聲；接着又是轟然一聲，有怒天崩地塌，自已的弄口被炸去了好機幢屋子。他本來想回家帶母親幼子逃命的，這一下，幾乎把的魂靈兒炸出了竅，腦筋變成了頑物。不管什麽，只是没命的爬行。</p>

<h3>撤懲張學良</h3>
<p>— 達</p>
<p>據説國難會議全塲一致通過了一條决議案！！「撤懲張學良。」當然，這是値得我們注意的一個大砲。但是這一砲到底能不能響，却更値得我們注意。　　在中國，殺一個普通老百姓，比吹灰還便當，可是，有刀，有槍，有「雄兵大將」的「帥」字派，或「長」字班的人物，却决不肯俯首貼耳輕輕易易讓你拔一根毛。張學良雖然對日無抵抗，一夜工夫，丢掉自已的老家，可是在「保全」實力」的政策下，他還有不少有名無實的軍隊，可以指揮。請問，國難會議諸公，準備了什麽力量，去對抗張學良的「實力」？</p>
<p>誠然，對付一個張學良的「實力」，在國内數數，還多得很，而且終日懷抱著「彼可取而代之」的心理，待時而發者，也正大有人在，果然如此，那不是又是一幕「實力」和「實力」火併的地盤戰，而結果仍是我們老百姓該死呢？</p>
<p>所以國難會議通過撤懲張學良的議决案，無論何人，没有不鼓掌稱快，但試問其結果如何，畢竟又是一個放空氣的大砲，其聲雖響，但是打不倒人，「官官相護」，原是我國有經騐的一句格言，并且國難會議，本來是一個臨時議事機關，原無强制政府執行的權威，故撤懲與否，仍是「本政府自有權衡，無」勞諸會員的嘵舌」。</p>
<p>若説撤懲二字，本來祗適用於無地位無槍階級的，若有地位又是有槍階級，照歷史上看來，貪贓枉法，作好犯科，原是家常便飯，再無人敢道個不字，本來不配用這撤懲二字，我想這幾個國難會的會員先生，並非不明瞭其中眞相，不過提出這樣一個好聽的議案，装装幌子罷了。</p>

<h3>公共租界車輛肇禍談沛</h3>
<p>一百四十人喪失生命</p>
<p>汽車肇禍共九千餘起</p>
<p>汽車肇禍之事。在歐美各大都市中。常有駭人聽聞之統計。上海市上現有汽車七千餘輛。肇禍之事亦時有所聞。大約一星期中至少有五六件之肇禍案發生。市政當局雖用種種方法以避免不幸事件之發生。然去年上海公共租界因車輛肇禍而喪失生命者。計共一百四十人。受傷者四千三百人。其數不可謂不鉅。茲將西報所載之統計。譯錄如次。一九三一年中滬埠公共租界中車輛肇禍。以十月份之紀錄爲最高度數。計經警務處手者一千二百七十九起。其中二十人受傷身死。此數實爲警務處歷史中。從來未有之一個月中最高紀錄。一九三一年十二月底前二日止。此一年中之車輛肇禍統計共爲一萬二千八百七十七起。較之前年續有增加。但死亡數則略遜。</p>
<p>一月份中肇禍案九百五十起。其中二百六十二人受傷。八人喪失生命。前年同時肇禍案八百三十起。二月份車輛失事統計爲八百五十三起。前年此月爲七百六十九起。受傷者二百四十人。死者六人。三月份肇禍案數目向上增加。其數爲九百六十九起。一九三零年爲九百八十二起。受傷者三百二十八人。去年則爲三百三十二人。死者其數較增爲十七人。一九三零年三月則爲十人。至四月中。車輛肇禍事件爲數又增。總數爲九百八十一起。其中三百五十二人受傷。六人受傷致死。前年同月肇禍案件八百九十五起。十五人身死。三百六十二人受傷。故此月若與上月相較。死亡之數則大减矣。</p>
<p>五月份車輛肇禍案陡然增多。共計一千零三十九起。死者十五人。受傷者三百六十七人。前年同時計九百六十六起。受傷者數爲三百二十五人。死者十二人。六月份總數一千一百零一起。死於車下者八人。受傷者四百四十三人。因時當砟季。汽車之用途大增。於是肇禍案件亦逐漸上增。直至十月之最高峰。一九三零年六月馬路肇禍事件爲九百三十九起。其中九人身死。三百六十七人受傷公共租界車輛肇禍案至七月份其數又增。計共一千一百十六起。其中十二人受傷死亡。四百四十三人受傷。前年七月肇禍爲九百二十六起。死十七人。傷三百七十人。八月份計一千一百七十九起。較七月略增。其中死者十二人。受傷者四百三十三人。前年七月肇禍案件九百二十六起。死十七人。傷三百零七人。八月份總數爲一千一百七十九起。較七月份亦略增。死者十二人。四百四十八人受傷。一七三零年八月肇禍案八百六十五起。其中十五人不救身死。三百十三人受傷。</p>
<p>九月份。警務處所處理之車輛肇禍案。計一千一百五十六起。其中受傷者四百四十五人。死者七人。前年九月肇禍事件爲八百九十三起。三百五十六人受傷。十三人喪失生命。十月份肇禍總數爲一千二百七十九起。死亡數爲二十人。受傷者四百四十九人。前年同月。車輛肇禍一千零十四起。傷者三百七十一人。死者十三人。十一月份。肇禍案一千一百四十三起。其中四百八十五人受傷。十五人喪失生命。若與前年比較。則肇禍事件爲九百七十四起。死十五人。傷三百二十二人。十二月份。至廿九日止。肇肇事件爲一千一百十三起。死者計十一人。</p>
<p>去年自正月至十一月止。馬路中汽車車輛肇禍事件分析如欽·一月。七百八十五起。二月。七百十三起。三月。七百七十五起。四月。七百四十七起。五月。八百四十一起。六月。七百九十三起。七月。八百起。八月。八百切十七起。九月。九百零二起。十月。一千零十七起。十一月。九百零九起。綜計九千一百七十二起。電車肇禍。去年十一個月爲一千五百九十六起。最高紀錄爲八月。數爲一百七十七起。公共汽車肇禍案爲八百七十六起。各種車輛之肇禍。包括手推車及黄包車等在内。計共八百零十四起。前年十二月之肇禍案爲九百二十起。一九三零年之肇禍總數爲一萬零九百七十三起。去年車務處在各區共造指揮車輛之交通燈十二具。年車務處控告車輛違警。一月份。西人六十四人。華人六百十八人。二月份。西人八十九人。華人六百零五人。三月份。西人爲五十一人。華人爲六百五十二人。一九三一年一月被車務警控車輛違警者。西人十六名。華人五百七十四名。二月份西人十九名。華人三百九十六名。三月份。西人三十一名。華人四百九十五名。四月份。西人五十五名。華人五百六十名。五月份。西人五十四名。華人四百五十二名。六月份。西人六十一名。華人七百五十三人。七月份。西人六十七名。華人五百四十四名。八月份。西人五十八名。華人五百四十四名。九月份。西人五十一名。華人六百五十二名。十月份。西人八十九名。華人六百零五名。十一月份。西人六十四名。華人六百十八名。</p>
<h3>本埠春季車務情形澤</h3>
<p>今年春季上海車務情形。除法租界與上年間同時期相仿彿外。公共租界方面變化較多。致與預期相差。最大之原因。由於日本軍隊佔用虹口一帶。使虹口·匯司·狄思威路·東嘉興路四處巡捕房之職務停滯。但所有鐵絲網·砂袋·及武装步哨之增設。反使交叉路常有之肇禍事件减少·而日本軍用車輛之碰撞·所引起之重大損害則殊不少。此不幸事件之原因。大半因日軍車輛行駛太快。及不諳本埠靠左方前進之交通。</p>
<p>二月份租界夜間十時後戒嚴。迨三月内又展長戒嚴時間至夜間十一時半。因此平時夜半發生之車輛肇禍事端。减少甚多。</p>
<p>去年春季車務禍端。總計二千七百七十二件。爲去年各季中之最多者。肇事之汽車。計二千二百七十三輛。共死三十一人。傷八百三十四人。但因汽車受傷者。佔五百六十三人。</p>
<p>今年二月份報告。車務禍端計五百五十一件。死十四人。傷一百九十人一人。去年同月共有八百五十三件。計死六人。傷三百四十人。</p>
<p>上月份即三月内。車輛事件計八百件。此中汽車佔七百件。電車與公共汽車所肇之禍端。則特别减少。二月份日期較短。計死十四人。而三月份較長。反僅十人身死。負傷者則有二百六十八人。</p>
<p>總計本年春季車輛事件。在九十一日中。共二千四百件。死三十四人。較上年多死三人。傷者七百七十五人。</p>
<p>本年春季之汽車銷數。大爲减少。但樂觀者則謂夏季開始後。營業當可逐漸恢復。公共租界在去年終報告。所登記之各種汽車。計共八千九百零三輛。至本年三月三十一日止。登記之數仍相仿。計汽車六千一百六十二輛。運輸汽車一千九百三十七輛。機器脚踏車八百零四輛。</p>
<p>日本軍隊携來之各種車輛。經工部局發給執照者。計約六百輛。故本埠道路上。驟形擁擠。爲一九二零年後所罕覩。本埠載客汽車以福特爲最多。别克次之。其他以次爲馬律師·雪佛蘭·飛霞·司都培克。運貨汽車之最多者亦屬福特。第二爲司帝華。第三則屬於雪佛蘭云。</p>

<h3>馬律斯車費用統計敷</h3>
<p>每英里不足一又四分之一辨士汽車之功效。固已盡人皆知。無待贅述。惟汽車之耗費每英里須幾何。則猶無確切之統計。因斯一般人士之欲購置汽車者。輒懷疑於其費用之洗繁。而不敢貿然購置焉。其實眞正良好之車輛。其每英里之耗費。固自有其限制。非若吾人理想中之爲數不貲也。至若以其便利舒適與夫時間經濟等優點言之。則其費用之收穫。尤爲合算而値得。茲特以某君之汽車用費統計。揭載如次。藉供一般車主。曁欲購汽車者之參考焉。</p>
<p>某君所置之代步。爲馬律斯大牛牌六缸車。所歷途程。已逾一萬二千英里。君以其每英里之費用。製成統計之目的。蓋欲以眞實數字。證明馬律斯之駕駛耗費。曁尋常修理費等。一併在内。即從寛計之。每英里亦實不足一又四分之一辨士也。君於一九三○年七月一日。購進斯車之日起。至一九三一年元月一日。車上速度表之數字。爲五五三六。及十二月三十一日。表上數字。爲一七八五○。綜計一九三一年份。行程一二三一四英里。支出之費用如下……</p>
<p>汽油五四四加侖……三十五鎊十二先令八辨士……約合每英里百分之七十辨士車胎……十鎊十二先令三辨士……約合每英里百分之二十辨士機油脂油等……五鎊七先令二辨士……約合每英里百分之十辨士</p>
<p>以上共計五十一鎊十二先令一辨士……約合每英里一辨士</p>
<p>又駕駛修理費……五鎊二先六辨士……約合每英里百分之十八辨士　兩共六十鎊十四先令七辨士……合計每英里一辨士零一八</p>
<p>又雜費支出……照會……十五鎊……約合每英里百分之廿九辨士</p>
<p>……又……保險……十二鎊十七先令九辨士……約合英里百分之廿五辨士……又……汽車協會會費……二鎊二先令……約合每英里百分之四辨士</p>
<p>以上數項合計每英里費用一辨士零七六</p>
<p>君所用汽油。價値自每加侖一先令二辨士。至一先令四個半辨士者。均有之。結果胥極滿意。惟一九三一年分。汽油價較低廉。故爲妥愼計。一九三二年份燃料部份之費用預算。當稍增益。餘如車胎亦然。又空氣裏胎。遲早即須更換新者。故君對於一萬二千英里之費用估算。特作爲總數九十五鎊焉。此外君雇有車夫一名。然其費用未便計入。蓋因車夫工資。旣堕地而異。君之車夫。復兼司雜役。而車主之係躬親駕車。不復雇用車夫者。且復比比皆是也。按君車爲活頂轎式。確爲四季咸宜。極端舒適之車輛。其乘客除駕車者外。自一人至三人。某君預期該馬律斯大牛牌六缸車。於五年以内。足以適應一切需要。至於車行速度。平均爲每小時三十英里之譜云。</p>

<h3>談福特産業哲學（二）徐陸麟</h3>
<p>接近了眞理。而不能認識　。這是常人最易犯而最不易改救的毛病。</p>
<p>「除了新的認識。新的理解以外。並無何」</p>
<p>種新物的存在。新認識與新理解。全是經騐的結果。只有經騐的結果。才的完成人的品性。我信。我們所以生於世。就是集積經騐。完成品性而已、縱使我們知識的發端。雖然微少。但是我們每日增進實在知識的總量。即增進構造眞實生活的不滅眞理之總量。</p>
<p>另外還有許多推重經騐的話。總之經騐之爲物。是一切偉大成就之根源。並且這種經騐。並不是任何方法之中可以學得的。只有一點一滴的理解牠。」（以上是）第二章。）</p>
<p>第三章成功論</p>
<p>「人生成功的秘訣。就是發見自已所」應爲之事。而遂行之而已。大凡人類。有時不可不負有從事不快的事物的義務。還有時不能不從事於只有犧牲。而無報酬的事業。當最初從事於此等犧牲事業之時。往往被人誤解。侮辱。視同蠢物。因此之故。人人當然都想退避。然使確信這是不可不做的事。則不可不用全速力而猛進。至於成敗。則唯運命是從。這並不一定是愉快的。亦不一定是近合民衆的事。也不一定是民衆喜歡的事。不過恰合運命所希望於我們。與其命令我們。來成就的目的而已。若使有人直道而行。就是孤立。也不足畏。他實在並不孤立。因爲在正當的思想背後。默然跟着的有許多人。</p>
<p>「有多數愚人對於孤獨的高士。時有」間言。高士貌似孤獨。其實他不過沈默而已。孤獨的感觸惟當吾人站在歧途之上。一方想追隨從來的老套的生活方法。一方又想傾聽正在變化的人生之聲。對他表示服從時候。方如油然而生。在正决心那時刻。是很寂寞。但是一旦他决了心。遂行的義務之念。他已經不寂寞了。他一旦决心。與他抱同一思想的許多人。即刻就來附和他。並且期待他來宣言這種思想與這種主張。一</p>
<h3>奥奔汽車之雙比率</h3>
<p>所謂雙比率者。即同一車而有兩軸比也。有此装置。則無論山坡上下。或平地行駛。車之動作效能。自無往而不得心應手。按知用低比率。車行速度爲每小時五十英里。引擎轉動凡二千七百次。假令於同樣速度駛行時。驟然撥至高齒輪。即高比率。則引擎轉動。立即降至一千八百次。但車行速度。依然爲每小時五十英里也。引擎轉動次數旣减。煤氣耗費量自亦較少。於是震盪之鋭减。行駛之彌臻平穩。與更較經濟合算。自皆係當然結果。上圖小圓圈内。即装於表板　之　比率作。</p>
<p>他對於旁觀者的心理。也認識得非常清楚。他説。「當然有許多人取看風轉」舵的態度。他們不想執開導之勞。只希望在可能範圍内享受幸福。因爲替正義率先奮鬥的人。須受相當的苦痛。所以他們甯取看風轉舵的態度。旁觀眞理與錯誤的鬥爭。而待孰勝孰敗。縱令他們抱有眞理終占勝利的粗糙信仰。然而在勝負未决以前。絕不能期望他們與人後援。」</p>
<p>對於問題如何解决。他有一段意見。很足以發吾人之深者。他説。「一般的人。」與其説他由於試行解决問題。無寗説他由於徘徊於問題之周圍。而耗了較多的時間與精力。問題是對於諸君的智慧挑戰的。問題在未被解决以前。依然還是問題。解决問題的人。必得一定的報酬。我們應當變更迴避問題的態度而爲歡迎問題。用正當的思想能力。去對付問題。我們應當對他作正當的考慮。付以正當的報酬。慧眼的青年所耗的時間。在於學得直接對付問題的方法。詳言之。就是調和的學得運用他的頭腦。與中道的活動。能使他所知道的最簡便。最直接的方法。來解决面前的問題。」</p>
<p>第四章。我何以信用進步。他認爲成功的兩大障碍。是恐怖與驕矜。立論非常的透澈。他説。「我們勸告他人不要恐怖」是很容易。但要敎他如何脱去恐怖。却是困難的問題。人們若刻意把自已的恐怖詳細分析。以求其所以恐怖的原因。那末所得的恐怖解决法將不勝枚舉了。然後才知道恐怖實際是無謂的事。」</p>
<p>他以爲錯誤。並不是可惜的事。有許多的事。不經過錯誤。不能得到眞的進步。他説。「錯誤無論是發生於社會。或是發生」於製造新機械的時候。都要經過實際研究之後。才被發見的。……我們不患有錯誤。因爲錯誤是我們經騐的材料之一部。然而。若是對於錯誤的原因。或是對此錯誤。是否尚有救濟法等。而不加以考慮。立即放棄其事業。這才眞錯誤。我們因錯誤。可豈多得許多智識。我們在探究瑕疲以外。還有分析的必要。我們再從分析。進而從事適當的批評。由於適當的分析與批評。而生出更有價値。更爲完善的工作方法。換言之。就是生出眞的進步。「最後還有一段最有價値的理論。所謂時代表徴候。換言之。就是如何觀察到未來的時代。他説、「觀察時代的微徴候。就是對」着萬人公開眞理的方法。知識有二大要素。其一。是關於根本原理的知識。其二。是認識根本原理發展的知識。須有絕頂的知識。方能認識何物正在生長。向於何方面而生長。此即觀察時代的徴候的能力。所謂時代徴候。並非指現代的時代而言。乃指未來的時代徴候而言。」</p>
<p>「單想理解最近的時代的人們。是時代落」伍者。苟是知道時代的人。就會在時代到來以前。理解出來。這裏所謂時代徴候。就是未來時代的徴候。今日時代的徴候。早已遠在事前指示出來了。徴候實現的時候。已經不是徴候。而是時代自身了。表面的觀察事物。與澈底觀察事物。自是各别的事。」</p>
<p>「原來所謂生命。幾乎不是表現在表面上」的。我們所見的今日就是過去的産物。而遠在未來的根芽實已包藏於今日。實際上參透人生最深的人們。就是知道來日的人們。要想窺讀時代的徴候。不可不作獨的研究。詳言之。就是不可不讀多人所未讀的了。依我的所言。還須多讀尚未付印的東西。所以不可不明瞭埋在一切價値之下的根本價値。而下以獨創的斷案。所以窺讀時代的徴候的人。不可追隨他人。却當自行開拓新道。而求得可以爲將來變化之基礎的。原理。生命不絕。一如河流之變其進路。所以想眞正理解河流的人。應當循着河流的進路而進行。不應徘徊於水已涸竭之河床。人生也是如此「關於福特的著作。據著者所曉得的。只此一種。書中至理名言。不一而足。凡是圖謀進取的青年。均宜熟讀一過。一定可以得到許多很可寳貴的帮助。並希望出版界。能多多産生此類的出品。爲新興中國的新青年。作有力的參考與印證。</p>

        <h1>1932.04.20</h1>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Short and Condolences to Mr. Short's Mother</h3>
<p>American pilot Mr. Short, in order to uphold justice and peace, resolutely and voluntarily joined our army amidst the Shanghai disaster. He aided us in fighting against Japan. He said, "I was originally a person from a neutral country, but I have seen Japanese planes relentlessly bombing innocent men, women, children, and elderly in a war of unprovoked aggression, so I can no longer tolerate it." Unfortunately, on February 23rd, he was surrounded and attacked by six Japanese planes in Suzhou, and was ultimately burned to death. We express our deepest respect and sorrow for this righteous warrior who bravely upheld justice and sacrificed his life.</p>
<p>Short's kind mother traveled across the ocean to bury her beloved son and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is imaginable the grief and sorrow felt by this kind, white-haired elderly mother upon witnessing the remains of her beloved son who had died tragically. However, we believe that Short's death is not like an ordinary death but a death for the sake of upholding justice and peace, a glorious and great death. Although his body is dead, his great and noble spirit will forever remain in this world. Short's mother has a son. Even though she has lost her son, what sorrow is there to have? Looking at the tens of thousands of Chinese people gathered at the docks yesterday to warmly welcome the righteous warrior, one can know that Short's death has left a legacy of glory in the hearts of the 400 million people of China. Short's mother should also be able to restrain her grief. We sincerely wish that Short's mother will take good care of herself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is something we cannot refrain from saying. Since the Manchurian Incident erupted last year, the League of Nations has held four meetings, gathering diplomats and politicians from all over the world in one place, racking their brains and agonizing over it. Yet, they were unable to restrain the powerful, uphold justice, stand idly by as peace was broken, international conventions were trampled upon, and were at a complete loss. Compared to Short's righteous indignation and his rising up to fight against the powerful, even to the point of sacrificing his life, the difference is immeasurable. We believe that Short's heroic death further exposes the weakness and incompetence of the League of Nations, which ultimately lacks the sincerity and determination to restrain the powerful and uphold justice.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Japanese army, on the one hand, has shattered international treaties, trampled on justice, and disrupted peace, and yet, on the other hand, claims that it is protecting its nationals, safeguarding legitimate rights, and acting out of necessity. Under their reign of terror, the Northeast, as well as the war zones of Zhabei, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Wusong, have become desolate wastelands. Countless innocent people have died from artillery shells, and even more countless orphans and widows have been displaced and lost. Who is responsible for this? It is all a gift from the Japanese army's brutality. Short, as an American, voluntarily aided us in fighting against Japan. This is not only due to his affection for our country but also to his love for justice. Short's death has shown that the actions of the Japanese are absolutely intolerable to those who love justice and peace in the world. Furthermore, it shows that the light of justice can never be swallowed by power. As long as justice exists in the world, there will be countless Shorts who hate and abhor aggressors for opposing power and upholding justice. When the multitudes point their fingers, one dies without illness. Is military force truly reliable? The Japanese should think deeply about this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our country has an army of two million soldiers, spending more than 80 percent of its national budget annually. However, apart from Ma Zhanshan's troops last year and the 19th Route Army and other very few troops who voluntarily rose up to resist, the rest stood idly by when foreign aggression came. Some merely made declarations of prolonged resistance, while others merely issued telegrams vowing to be ready for battle with pillows as weapons. They were unable to resist insults and unable to defend territory. What is the meaning of their duty? Short, as a foreigner, acted righteously and sacrificed generously. Shouldn't the derelict soldiers of our country, upon seeing Short's death, feel even more ashamed and embarrassed and know to strive forward in the future?</p>
<h3>Draft Plan Formulated by the League of Nations Special Committee</h3>
<p>Deadline for Japanese Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Meeting to Make Final Decision</p>
<p>Submitted to the Chinese and Japanese Governments</p>
<p>Telegram to Ambassador Nagaoka Regarding Troops</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 19th: The draft plan proposed by the Committee of Nineteen has been submitted to the Chinese and Japanese governments and is awaiting a response. If they express their agreement, a public meeting will be held to address the matter.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 19th: The drafting committee of the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations General Assembly has drafted a resolution on the principles for the conduct of the armistice conference. The full text will be reviewed and approved at a meeting at 3:30 PM, after which it will be submitted to a closed meeting of the Committee of Nineteen convened at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 19th: The Committee of Nineteen will hold a closed meeting at 4:30 PM this afternoon to finalize the draft.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 18th: Dr. Yen Hui-ching, the chief Chinese representative, expressed China's dissatisfaction to Mr. Hymans, the chairman of the Committee of Nineteen, regarding the recommendations made by the committee on Saturday and Sunday. Mr. Yen requested a public meeting, which is expected to be held around Tuesday. The Committee of Nineteen considered a draft resolution proposed by Mr. Hymans and a revised version by Czech Foreign Minister Benes. As a result, it was decided to establish a drafting committee to draft a concrete resolution on the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Chinese territory for adoption at the next meeting. The plan proposed by the Committee of Nineteen on Saturday and Sunday was to organize a mixed committee to report to the League of Nations General Assembly on whether normal conditions had been restored, and then the League of Nations General Assembly would advise Japan to withdraw its troops. Mr. Hymans' resolution was drafted based on this plan. Mr. Benes' amendment, proposed by the smaller countries of the League of Nations, argued that neither China nor Japan should participate in the mixed committee, which could decide at any time when Japanese troops should withdraw. British Foreign Secretary Simon opposed the proposal that the mixed committee should decide the date of troop withdrawal, arguing that if this proposal were adopted, the committee's responsibility would be too great, and the United States, which is now a member of the Shanghai troop withdrawal conference, is not a member of the League of Nations. After lengthy discussion, it was decided to refer both proposals to the drafting committee to prepare a final resolution, which must be approved in a closed meeting before being submitted to a public meeting. The representatives of all countries unanimously agreed that the date of withdrawal of Japanese troops should be determined by the Shanghai Mixed Committee and submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly, which would then make a final decision and bear responsibility for this matter. According to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, the Japanese representative currently does not want to start a debate with the Chinese representative in a public meeting but will provide all information to the League of Nations. Before the Committee of Nineteen decided on its general attitude, the smaller countries held a secret meeting. The drafting committee is composed of representatives from France, Italy, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Spain, Colombia, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Sweden. It has begun its work and will address the matter on Tuesday. However, the final resolution must be reviewed by the Chinese and Japanese representatives before being submitted to the Committee of Nineteen.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 18th: At a meeting of the Committee of Nineteen, Chairman Hymans seemed determined not to specify a deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai. The committee believes that the mixed committee proposed in the draft armistice agreement is qualified to consider when conditions conducive to troop withdrawal are met. After the mixed committee has considered the matter, it will report to the Committee of Nineteen, which will determine whether withdrawal is necessary and then specify a withdrawal deadline.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 19th: The chief Japanese representative, Ambassador Nagaoka, telegraphed the Japanese Foreign Ministry regarding the resolution adopted by the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations. The resolution of the Committee of Nineteen states that the Mixed Committee will monitor the restoration of normal conditions in the Shanghai area and determine the final date by which Japanese troops can withdraw, and report to the League of Nations, etc. Foreign Minister Yoshizawa immediately consulted with key officials of the Foreign Ministry, and the results were as follows: (1) According to the armistice agreement, the first withdrawal will naturally be monitored by the Mixed Committee, but the final withdrawal date should be decided solely by Japan, without the need for other countries to determine it on their behalf. (2) According to the resolution adopted by the Committee of Nineteen, the League of Nations side will have the Mixed Committee determine the final withdrawal date and report this to the League of Nations. This is like using the power of the General Assembly to try to force the Japanese government to carry out the final withdrawal. Therefore, the result of the Japanese army's actions being interfered with by various countries contradicts the command and control of military affairs and also contradicts the fundamental Japanese policy that "the resolutions of the Committee of Nineteen cannot bind Japan in the future." Therefore, it is difficult for Japan to agree to this resolution without changes. After reaching a consensus, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa telegraphed the contents of the proposal to Japanese representative Nagaoka this morning and reported it at today's cabinet meeting, requesting approval. The reply telegram stated disagreement with the proposal that the Mixed Committee has the right to determine the final withdrawal date, arguing that the date should be determined solely by the Japanese government, as the Committee of Nineteen's resolution, cannot bind the Japanese government. If the Committee of Nineteen adopts this resolution, Japanese representative Nagaoka should declare the aforementioned reservation.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th: The Manchester Guardian</p>
<p>reported in an editorial on the work of the Committee of Nineteen that Japan is now repeating in Shanghai the same tricks it played in Manchuria. The conclusion stated that if the Committee of Nineteen does not prove to be more resolute than the Council of the League of Nations, or specify a date for the withdrawal of Japanese troops, or have neutral observers determine that normal conditions in Shanghai have been restored, then Japan's aggressive policy may prove its justification in the end.</p>

<p>Eighty-Seven Organizations Went to Welcome Her</p>
<p>Government Representative Tang Hai'an Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Funeral Scheduled for the 24th</p>
<p>Captain Short, an American aviator, sacrificed his life on February 22nd in Suzhou by resisting six Japanese planes with one plane due to his anger at the arrogance of Japanese planes. His righteousness is forever unforgettable to our people. Mother Eilley Boerstler Short, in response to a telegram from the National Government, set off from her hometown of Tacoma, Washington, with her second son, Edmund, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 2:10 PM aboard the President Taft of the Dollar Steamship Lines. Representatives from all walks of life who went to welcome her at the new customs pier were countless, so crowded that it was impossible to move. Municipal government representative Yu Hongjun, military government representative Shen Dexie, aviation administration representative Lin Wojiang, as well as Mrs. Li Jinlun, Mrs. Wen Yuqing, etc., all boarded a special launch prepared by the customs to greet her. The ceremony was grand and reached its peak. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Scene at the Pier: Shanghai Municipal Police Chief Wen Yingxing specially dispatched two launches, Wanshun and others, each carrying ten armed water police officers led by a patrol leader, to patrol the Jiangmian area of the new customs pier to show protection. The Fourth Avenue General Patrol Room of the Public Concession sent Chinese and Western armed detectives to protect the new customs pier and direct the traffic to avoid crowding. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps specially sent two companies of the Volunteer Corps and two gun carriages to the pier to pay their respects. The General Headquarters of the Boy Scouts of China sent more than 200 boy and girl scouts from Liangjiang, Guangong, Xiangsheng, He'an, Silk Workers, Shanghai High School, Postal Service, Fudan, Guanghua, Moore, Training Class, Guangyi, etc., led by Commander-in-Chief Wang Gang, to stand near the new customs pier to maintain order.</p>

<p>General Arrangement: A white cloth banner with welcoming words in English was hung facing the Huangpu River at the new customs pier. At the exit, a horizontal banner in Chinese welcoming the mother of the righteous American aviator Short was hung. The special welcoming launches were Jinghui of the Customs and Liffei of the Dredging Bureau. Each launch had a small archway planted with pine and cypress at the bow, each decorated with the words "Welcome" in English. In the cabin of the Liffei, both the Chinese and American flags were hung on each side. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent a water patrol team on a Public Security launch to protect the special launch. The Pudong Pier was guarded by personnel dispatched by the Third District Office of the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Welcoming Situation: The President Taft, on which Mother Short and others were traveling, sailed into the Huangpu River at about 1:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Bailianjing Pier in Pudong. The two special welcoming launches prepared by the customs immediately set sail. Welcoming representatives from all sides, including Tang Hai'an, boarded the Liffei launch and sailed directly to Bailianjing, boarded the President Taft. The representatives gathered in the grand lounge in the boat. After a while, Mother Short appeared with her second son and female companion. First, Tang Hai'an stepped forward and bowed, and introduced each of the welcoming representatives and shook hands as a courtesy.</p>

<p>Mr. Tang Delivered a Speech: Then, Mother Short stood outside, and Tang Hai'an, a representative of the National Government, delivered a welcome speech, which roughly said: "On behalf of the Chinese government and all the people, I welcome the gracious arrival of Mother Short. Our country is extremely grateful for the sacrifice of your beloved son for justice. We, representing the government and the people, boarded the launch to welcome you and accompany you to the pier, where there are still hundreds of representatives waiting to welcome you, which shows that the whole country has a very deep gratitude for you." Then, Mother Short delivered a reply, saying, "I am deeply grateful for your kindness. I feel particularly happy today to be on the soil of your country. My son fought for justice and is very honored."</p>
<p>Flower Presentation Ceremony: Finally, Mrs. Wen Yuqing presented a bouquet of flowers and bowed, placing it in Mother Short's hands. Mother Short was wearing a black coat and looked quite dignified. She is 45 years old this year. Her second son, Edmund, was wearing a blue serge suit and a cap, looking handsome and tall, and is 22 years old. He is currently studying at university. Although the welcoming ceremony was very simple, it was quite solemn. After the flower presentation ceremony, the welcoming representatives accompanied Mother Short and others off the launch and onto the special Liffei launch.</p>
<p>Landing Situation: The Jianghai Customs Liffei and Jinghui launches, when approaching the pier, all the welcoming personnel on the pier took off their hats to pay their respects. The Liffei launch, on which Mother Short was traveling, arrived at the new customs pier at 2:15 PM. After Mother Short got off the pier, she shook hands with municipal government representative Yu Hongjun and representatives from various groups, including Hu Fengxiang, and walked out of the new customs. At that time, the welcoming personnel and boy scouts standing by the roadside all took off their hats and raised flags to show their respect. She then boarded a sedan car with a note from the municipal government No. 1813 and a note from the concession No. 11548 and first drove to Tang Hai'an's private residence in the French Concession for a brief rest. She was then accompanied by Mrs. Li Jinlun, Mrs. Tang Hai'an, Mrs. Wen Yuqing, and others to Room 633 of the Cathay Hotel for a rest.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun's Speech: Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, delivered a welcome speech at the new customs pier yesterday, saying, "I respectfully represent all the citizens of the city to welcome the arrival of Mother Short. Your son, the righteous Short, sacrificed himself for justice and humanity, and our citizens admire him immensely." Mother Short replied, "It is glorious to have such a son, even in death. Thank you very much for your welcome." In addition, the National Salvation Association of various groups in this city yesterday issued a welcoming speech to Mother Short, saying, "April 19, 21st year of the Republic of China, the 87 member groups of the National Salvation Association of various groups in Shanghai, jointly with the National Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government, with the utmost sincerity, welcome Mother Short, the mother of the righteous Short, who sacrificed himself for international justice, to show our respect and uphold justice."

<p>Express our sincere respect.</p>
<p>A solemn funeral for Mr. Short's remains will be held on the 24th of this month, as scheduled by the Mr. Short Memorial Committee at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. The burial site is set in the middle of Hongqiao Airdrome, and eight pilots, four Americans and four representatives from our country, will be invited to participate in the ceremony. At the same time, the coffin will be carried from the International Funeral Home through Daxi Road to the airdrome, and guests will walk to Daxi Road and then take a car to the airdrome. Many Chinese and American planes will soar in the air at that time to show their mourning. However, the date of burial must be agreed upon by Mother Short before it can be implemented.</p>
<p>Welcome Banquet Last Night: Last night at 8:00, Tang Hai'an, a representative of the National Government, hosted a banquet for Mother Short at the Cathay Hotel. The dishes were quite simple, as Mother Short was heartbroken over the loss of her son and could not eat much. Yu Hongjun, Guo Dehua, Mrs. Li Jinlun, Mrs. Wen Yuqing, Mrs. Tang Hai'an, and others accompanied her at the banquet. Did Not Attend Banquet: Mother Short plans not to attend any banquets hosted by various circles in Shanghai until Mr. Short is buried. According to Short's brother, she and her mother may go to the International Funeral Home today to visit Mr. Short's spirit.</p>
<p>Short's Brother's Conversation: Our reporter interviewed Edmund Short, the younger brother of the righteous Short, yesterday. Edmund carried a handheld camera and took photos along the way, saying that this was his first trip to the Far East. He could not determine the date of his stay in Shanghai. The bad news of his brother's death was published in various American newspapers the day after the incident, in detail, but it was still not confirmed. It was not until three days later that the official telegram from Shanghai arrived at our home. My mother and others were extremely grief-stricken and came to China to handle the funeral affairs. My mother has no prejudices about the ceremony or anything else. I can also fly a plane, which was taught to me by my brother. My brother was only 27 years old and was a very experienced pilot. Our reporter asked about the family situation of Mother Short and the anecdotes of the righteous Short. Mother Short, due to the fatigue of the journey, agreed to talk in detail later.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Armistice Conference Not Yet Scheduled</p>
<p>We Quietly Await the League of Nations' Decision</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, returned to Shanghai by the Baohe ship at 6:00 PM yesterday. According to sources in diplomatic circles, before leaving Nanjing, Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei convened a meeting of various ministers at the official residence of the Ministry of Railways to make a final decision on the principles of the armistice conference. Vice Minister Guo came to Shanghai in accordance with this final policy to continue the armistice and troop withdrawal negotiations. As for the content of this final policy, it concerns foreign affairs and is not convenient to announce in advance. Our side originally agreed to reopen the armistice conference in Shanghai. However, our established policy is to proceed with the League of Nations first. Therefore, the date of reopening the armistice conference here must be after the Special Committee of the League of Nations passes a resolution, which is also a natural trend. Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Kio visited British Ambassador Lampson, American Ambassador Johnson, Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano, and French Representative Legrand yesterday afternoon, intending to reopen the armistice conference tomorrow and hoping to receive a reply from Vice Minister Guo after his return to Shanghai. However, as of last night, the date of reopening the armistice conference was still not determined. According to semi-official sources, if there is a resolution in Geneva today, negotiations can be reopened here tomorrow based on the League of Nations resolution, as the conference has not broken down. The friendly envoys are also staying in Shanghai to mediate. A phone call is all it takes to convene a meeting. Now we are quietly awaiting the final news from Geneva. Our reporter met with Vice Minister Guo yesterday and asked about our attitude towards the compromise plan for the deadline for Japanese troop withdrawal proposed by the Special Committee of the League of Nations. Guo replied that the Special Committee of the League of Nations Assembly has not yet passed any resolution through a public meeting, so it is not convenient to criticize it at this time. However, the government has issued instructions to Representative Yan that it believes that the phrase "restoring normal conditions" in the compromise plan proposed by the Special Committee of the League of Nations involves political issues and cannot be accepted.</p>
<h3>Frontline Military News Summary</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 19th Special Dispatch: On the 19th, there was an enemy transport ship in the Liuhe River, carrying two to three hundred traitors, heading northeast. In the Taicang area, the Japanese army is stationed at the two most important bridgeheads in Liuhe. In Yanglinkou, Xintangshi, Pailoushi, and other places, there are only Japanese troops patrolling back and forth every day, and they leave in the evening. The Public Security Chief of Ning captured several Han traitors, who were sent to the headquarters of the 19th Army on the 19th. They were hired by the Japanese to spread poison in the territory of the various garrisons, to reconnaissance, etc. An enemy plane came to Suzhou in the morning and afternoon, flew back and forth several times along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to the west, and then flew back to reconnaissance. A local bully named San Lao Ban organized a false local maintenance association in Liuhe, responsible for all the procurement matters of the Japanese army, and two Japanese vagrants served as advisors. San Lao Ban bullied and oppressed the local people. Shops in Liuhe are allowed to trade only for three hours from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM in front of the maintenance association at Lao Lang Bridge Alley, and they are not allowed to do business at any time or place. There are more than 100 Japanese troops stationed in the area of Luduqiao, Loutang, and Zhujiaqiao, many of whom are from Jiangbei. These people sell foreign cloth along the way and bully, kill, loot, and rape in the villages under the guise of the Japanese. Refugees who have returned from Luduqiao are now fleeing again. Recently, enemy planes have frequently come to Shaxi for reconnaissance. There are indeed no enemy ships in the Yanglinkou Floating Bridge area.</p>
<p>Changshu, 19th Special Dispatch: At the end of the 19th day, a large enemy ship was seen outside Hupukou, heading upstream. The enemy troops are now gathering at Liuhe and Luduqiao. Xintang and Yuewang have only a few patrols and return in the evening. This time, the enemy's retreat seems to be leaning towards the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Fifty to sixty people from the Red Cross Society arrived in Tai on the evening of the 18th to prepare for work.</p>

You are truly the savior of the nation. We send this telegram in reply and respectfully pray for your efforts. The National Salvation Association of the Republic of China, Hao.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Land at Pudong Donggou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Inquiring Whether There Are Chinese Troops Stationed</p>
<p>The Police Station Has Reported to the Public Safety Bureau</p>
<p>A Japanese destroyer No. 15 is anchored off Pudong Xigou Bund, Pudong Zhong. Yesterday afternoon around 2 PM, the ship lowered a small motorboat containing thirteen armed sailors, led by what appeared to be two officers. They approached the Donggou wharf and landed, heading straight towards the Xidu wharf, passing through Huotang (place name), Xujiaqiao to the north, and reaching Jielu (road name) to the east. They patrolled along the way and lingered for a moment in the wilderness of Zhuangjiawan, before heading towards the shore of Zhaojiatan and returning to the original boat back to the warship. When the sailors passed through Donggou, they encountered a police officer named Jiang from the Fifth Precinct of the Third District there, and asked if there were any Chinese troops stationed there. Officer Jiang replied that there were only police and the Baoan Tuan (Security Group), but no troops. The sailors thanked him. They asked the farmers the same questions wherever they went. Afterwards, the police station chief Wang reported the landing of the Japanese sailors to the Public Safety Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Detains Our Air Force Personnel</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that Guo Jianhua, a lieutenant colonel of the Chinese Air Force Headquarters (transliteration), was arrested on Saturday night near the Japanese Army Headquarters in Yangshupu and taken to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters for investigation. Guo was wearing plain clothes when arrested but possessed documents sufficient to prove his identity.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute Between Japanese and Chinese Workers in Pudong</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consul Actually Warns the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Said Government to Protect</p>
<p>Party and Government Organs Stop Union Activities</p>
<p>All Chinese workers in the No. 1 and 2 factories of the Japanese-owned Rihua Textile Co., Ltd. in Lujiazui, Pudong, are unwilling to return to work. The Japanese Consul Murai has actually issued a warning to the municipal government, and the situation is very serious. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Vowing Not to Resume Work</h3>
<p>The Rihua Yarn Factory has more than 3,000 Chinese workers. Since the start of the Shanghai Incident, they have voluntarily declared a strike and instructed the foremen to notify the workers. However, all the workers, because the Japanese army used violence to invade our country's territory, held a general meeting convened by the Rihua branch of the Fifth District Cotton Textile Industry Workers' Union and resolved that (1) the Japanese troops will not withdraw for a single day; (2) the factory will not compensate for the losses during the shutdown; (3) the original monthly bonuses will not be restored; (4) a large number of workers laid off due to the idle cloth machines will not be reinstated. If this happens, all the workers are determined not to return to work. As a result, on the day of resumption of work, not a single person returned to work.</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Warns The Japanese in the factory, because all the workers were united in not returning to work, reported to the general manager, Japanese Ochi Kisaburo, believing that the Chinese workers' failure to return to work was instigated by the union and requested the Japanese Consulate to negotiate with our government. Yesterday morning, the Japanese Consul Murai verbally warned our municipal government, generally stating that if the municipal government cannot stop the actions of the Rihua workers, it must ensure that the Chinese workers return to work as usual and protect the factory. Otherwise, Japan will use force to stop the union's actions.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Protects In addition to verbally agreeing to the Japanese Consul that it will definitely find a way to protect the Rihua Yarn Factory, the municipal government also instructed the Municipal Public Safety Bureau to order its subordinates to send police to protect it. Wen Yingxing, the director of the Public Safety Bureau, ordered Zhang, the district chief of the Third District Police Station in Pudong, to send police to provide protection. At the same time, personnel were sent to coordinate with the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Department to find a solution to avoid expansion. Together to Deal With At 2:00 PM yesterday, Wang Guoxian of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, Wang Xianqing of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and Xu Yefu of the Municipal Party Department, together with Zhang, the district chief of the Third District Police Station in Pudong, went to coordinate. As a result, they believed that the actions of the Rihua branch of the Fifth District Cotton Textile Industry Workers' Union were inappropriate and ordered the branch to cease its activities. The Japanese in the factory were satisfied with this. As for the workers' resumption of work, it will be decided by the workers themselves. Another Report The Rihua Yarn Factory in Pudong yesterday also ordered mechanics to repair the machines and instructed the foremen to notify the workers again, deciding to officially start work on the 25th of this month (next Monday). The workers are still taking a wait-and-see attitude. The Rihua Workers' Union also sent a letter to the Chinese foremen in the factory, instructing them to persuade the workers not to work for the Japanese before the Japanese troops withdraw from the country. Unexpectedly, the foreman handed this warning letter to the factory's foreman for review. The Japanese immediately forwarded this letter to the country's naval authorities for instructions. The Japanese Navy immediately sent an officer, accompanied by more than ten soldiers, to the factory (the soldiers did not land) and invited Zhang, the district chief of the local Third District, to the factory to talk. The Japanese officer used the letter as a basis to question whether the police station could protect the factory. Otherwise, they would take appropriate security measures. District Chief Zhang calmly replied that this district has always done its utmost to fully protect foreign merchants' factories and warehouses along the Pudong area, and no accidents have ever occurred. If the factory is preparing to start work, it will naturally ensure that the workers strictly abide by the order and there will be no out-of-bounds actions that would damage the factory's property. The Japanese officer nodded and left.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Japanese Imports in March</h3>
<p>The Main Points of the Letter of Advice From the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Why Sacrifice Fallen Soldiers and Suffering Compatriots?</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters to chambers of commerce in various places and trade associations in this city yesterday. The original text is as follows: (1) A letter to chambers of commerce in various places says: Dear Sirs, The northeast land has fallen into the hands of the enemy, and the battlefields of Shanghai are still stained with blood. This is when the people of the whole country are weeping and gnashing their teeth, and sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall. However, according to recent Japanese newspapers, the number of exports to China in March decreased by only 8% compared with the same period in previous years. It is an undeniable fact that the dying embers of Japanese goods are being rekindled and will restore their previous prosperity. The psychology of the people in this country, who are shamelessly serving the enemy, is a million times more tragic than losing land and troops. Japanese Prime Minister Inukai, during his recent inspection of the newly completed battleship, made a bold statement published in various newspapers, saying that in future wars, only money and the Yamato spirit are needed to maintain its permanent victory. We think about how Japan is a country that relies on industry and commerce, and the source of its money is nothing more than foreign trade, and foreign trade is mainly with China and the United States. Since Japan occupied the Northeast, the intellectual class in the United States has also resolved to refuse to use Japanese goods. They are in a position of onlookers and are also moved by righteous indignation. Are the people of our country, who have been slaughtered, indifferent and unmoved? Trading with them, providing them with money, allowing them to buy ships and equipment, and complete the tools to kill us. What kind of behavior is this? Is this human? Therefore, refusing to buy and use Japanese goods today is a matter of course, and the case is as solid as a mountain and cannot be shaken. In short, refusing to buy Japanese goods is to reduce the enemy's combat power and protect the lives of our people. There are traitors and scoundrels everywhere, but only strict organization in groups and fair sanctions in society will make those treacherous merchants who dare to take the risk, once discovered, will be permanently despised by their peers and permanently despised by mankind. Then, even if these people are stubborn and ignorant, they will change their plans. The Chamber of Commerce believes that this matter has reached the most critical juncture. If various places cannot be strictly consistent and allow Japanese goods to continue to be imported, then Japan, having taken the Three Eastern Provinces as its lifeline, will restore trade in North China and South China as its business and livelihood. After a few years, its feathers will be abundant, and our entire country will inevitably fall under its control. There is no chance of national extinction. In addition to sending a letter to various trade associations in Shanghai to strictly supervise their peers, it is hoped that your association will fight hard, deal with it calmly, supervise it at all times, and find ways to prevent it properly. (2) A secret letter to various trade associations in this city states that this association notified various industries on March 26 that when the Japanese took advantage of the occupation of Shanghai, they would vigorously promote trade along the Yangtze River, and Shanghai, as a distribution area for goods, was the source of the strategy to restore trade along the Yangtze River. This time, Japan used its naval, land, and air forces to carry out large-scale massacres in Shanghai. The main reason is this strategy. All our Chinese people should remember the national hatred that has not been avenged and encourage themselves to endure hardship and restrain their peers from privately importing Japanese goods to avoid assisting the enemy and providing food to the bandits. However, according to recent reports, large quantities of Japanese goods have been imported in recent days. Judging from the situation, the Japanese must have seen that our people's morale has slackened and thought that there was an opportunity to take advantage of. They hope to take the opportunity to restore their prosperous trade with China. At this time, the northeast land has fallen into the hands of the enemy, and the battlefields of Shanghai are still stained with blood. If we forget our past suffering and shamelessly serve the enemy, hoping to share my share of the enemy's commercial profits, how can we face the fallen soldiers and the suffering compatriots? In terms of their behavior, they should be treated the same as those who help the rebels. Therefore, we are again issuing a strict notice to each trade association to strictly investigate whether their affiliated industries have privately imported Japanese goods. If there are those who dare to take the risk, they should be severely punished by the members of the same industry to prevent them from gaining a foothold in the same industry. We hope that you will handle this matter effectively and report the handling situation for future reference.</p>
<h3>British Troops Set Sail for Hong Kong</h3>
<p>HMS Kent Loaded Up and Departed</p>
<p>When the Shanghai battle was fierce, the British Navy flagship HMS Kent came to Shanghai and sent several battalions of the army. Because Shanghai does not need to station many troops, the HMS Kent flagship has already loaded 900 British soldiers yesterday and set sail back to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Japanese Utsunomiya Brigade Withdraws</h3>
<p>New Troops Transferred to Take Over the Front Lines</p>
<p>The soldiers of various units belonging to the 14th Division of the Japanese Army on the front lines in the area of Mucang, Jiading, and Xintang City have recently been suffering from illnesses due to not being acclimatized. Commander Shirakawa urgently withdrew these soldiers from the front to Shanghai. They withdrew to return to the country yesterday afternoon for recuperation. The newly transported troops were transferred to take over. The investigation records are as follows:</p>
<p>The 19th Regiment of the 27th Brigade The 19th Infantry Regiment belonging to the 27th Brigade of the 14th Division of the Japanese Army, as well as the officers and battalion bottoms of the brigade headquarters, etc., arrived at the Osaka Wharf in Yangshupu at 11:00 AM yesterday and boarded the transport ship Ikoma Maru, which left Shanghai at noon. It is found that the 27th Brigade is the Utsunomiya Unit, and this time it is still withdrawn to its original defense for rest.</p>
<p>Reserve Team At the same time, a large team of reserve soldiers from the 27th Brigade, as well as the sanitation team, communications team, and the Matsumoto 50th Regiment, etc., also arrived at the Huangpu Wharf at 11:30 AM yesterday and set off for Japan on the transport ship Haixiang Maru. ▲Yesterday, a total of more than 3,000 Japanese soldiers set sail from three warships, as well as the weapons and ammunition of various units, etc., which were loaded by two torpedo boats of the 15th Squadron and a destroyer of the 26th Squadron dispatched by the Japanese Navy Command and escorted the two transport ships to Japan. Therefore, they were exported at the same time yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Logistics Troops The independent logistics battalion belonging to the 14th Division of the Japanese Army, which was originally stationed in the Jiading area, has already returned to Shanghai from the front yesterday and set up camps in the Wusong Road and Yalu Road areas for temporary stationing. It is scheduled to return to the country by transport ship at noon tomorrow. In addition, a large team of naval landing forces from the Wu Zhen Shufu brought by Nomura before has also received an order to withdraw. It has been decided that they will depart from Shanghai at the same time as the independent logistics brigade on the 21st.</p>
<h3>US Fleet Stationed in the Philippines Leaves</h3>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 17th - The US 17th Destroyer Squadron of six destroyers will conclude its service at sea in Asia tonight, departing from here and heading to Guam and Honolulu before returning to Mare Island Naval Shipyard to be reassigned to the reserve force. This is part of the US Navy's reorganization plan, which was originally planned to be implemented, but was delayed due to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu National Disaster Relief Association Pained by the Failure of Party Governance</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu National Disaster Relief Association issued a circular stating: To all levels of government, all agencies, and all groups in the country, Since the Kuomintang has been in power for five years, the people of the whole country have been hoping for good governance every day. However, the more they hope, the more they are disappointed. Strict inspections and vigorous actions were taken to eliminate corruption and eliminate local bullies. How could they know that corrupt officials and bureaucrats, the old ones have not been removed, and the new ones are even worse. Local tyrants and gentry, the old ones are still there, and the young ones are emerging. Warlords are rejected by the people, but are today's troops not harming the people? The youth are the lifeblood of the country, but are today's students not suffering from the environment? These are obvious facts at present, and they are also the biggest questions at present. Kuomintang party members are spread throughout the country and occupy the position of teachers and guardians, calling for political tutelage every day. People's organizations and groups must go through the party headquarters for registration and approval. A student who has not yet graduated from junior high school can raise his arms and take the stage, sternly scolding elders, and the elders obey and dare not speak. This is because the country has given them the power of political tutelage. A county magistrate is routinely supervised by the county party headquarters, and the county party committee members, two or three young people, actually control the power. In theory, the knowledge, ability, and cultivation of the supervisor must be superior to those of the supervised person to be able to perform their duties and not be in debt to their affairs. Today, all parties feel the lack of talent. Those who are in charge of provincial politics are worrying about the difficulty of selecting suitable county magistrates. The selection of county magistrates is already so difficult, and the number of county party committees in charge of supervision is three or four times that of the current county magistrates. Why can the party members select and circle themselves so quickly? Among them, there must be many people whose ability, knowledge, and cultivation cannot meet the requirements of supervising county administration. Although they are not capable of their duties, they are unwilling to be lonely because of their youth and vigor. Therefore, they show their sharpness and abuse their power. The police team can be arbitrarily commanded, the people can be arbitrarily arrested, and property can be arbitrarily confiscated. Civil and criminal lawsuits can be arbitrarily interfered with. If the county magistrate is weak, he will follow his breath and obey everything, resulting in a lot of jokes. If the county magistrate is upright, disputes will arise and they will fight all day long. The only way is to abandon his official position and leave. This is because the country has given them the power of supervision. What is the difference between entrusting important tasks to those who are not capable of them and giving children sharp knives and letting them play with them? All these situations are known to the higher-level party headquarters. Those who know it but are unwilling to resolutely cancel or correct it have other difficulties that cannot be fully understood by the people outside the party who are being tutored. However, there are rumors that party members with a conscience occasionally reveal secrets, saying that there are factions in the party, and the infighting is very fierce. During elections, there are all kinds of ugly behaviors. Since there are factions, they want to take advantage of them, each planting a weave inside and confronting each other. If they are cancelled, they will inevitably lose their footing, teach the monkeys to climb trees, and the party will naturally have no way to correct it. Based on the repeated infighting in the Kuomintang over the years, A and B scolding each other, giving full play to the conditions, and resolving previous grudges, it is possible that what they say is not completely unfounded. Some say that the Kuomintang only knows about the party and does not know about the people, only knows that party members can be united and can be used, and does not know that the people outside the party who are being tutored also have ears and eyes and have the same sense of right and wrong. With this intention, it seems unwise. In fact, there are also virtuous people in the Kuomintang who are usually heartbroken about the daily decline of the party and even admit the crime of misleading the country, but they can only sigh in private and dare not speak publicly in the main hall. The situation of accumulated difficulties makes it impossible for even the virtuous to be bound by it. Since the Shenyang disaster last year until the Shanghai Incident this year, the people feel the national disaster more and more urgently and expect the government to be more and more eager. As a result, they are more and more dissatisfied with the Kuomintang. To be fair, our country is suffering from unprecedented foreign insults, which have been planted for many years. Before the Xinhai Revolution, the Qing government was out of the question. After the establishment of the Republic of China, there was the stimulation of the Twenty-One Demands, but they did not know how to innovate. There was the help of the Washington Conference, but they could not move themselves. The succession of political decay has nothing to do with the Kuomintang. What is a pity is that in 1927, the National Revolutionary Army determined the Yangtze River, and the government was completed. Over the past five years, 100 million yuan of public bonds have been issued, but they have failed to use the people's desire to implement the policies that the people need, resulting in party fatigue inside and people's fatigue outside. The country's vitality is declining day by day, and the party's credibility is declining day by day. When a sudden and extraordinary change comes, they deeply feel the difficulty of dealing with it. The cause and effect are related, and the situation should be so. Now, in order to save this dying country, we still hope that the party and government authorities will wake up and take the spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance to eliminate the old habits of suspicion and separation. Immediately gather talents from all over the country to form a national disaster government to respond to the current incident, revise laws and regulations, and ensure absolute freedom of people to assemble and associate. Even if it belongs to a political group, it is not prohibited, and the power to register and approve is controlled by the administrative organs. It also explicitly orders that political tutelage be ended within three months and a representative body of public opinion be established. Within five months, a constitution will be formulated. All county party headquarters' expenses will be stopped. Taking Jiangsu as an example, the average annual expense of each county's party headquarters is 10,000 yuan (actually more than this). Sixty-one counties total 610,000 yuan, seizing the blood and sweat of our fathers, elders, brothers, and using it for this harmful and useless purpose. How can this political tutelage be enough to tutor? If it is used to open specialized schools for agriculture and industry, ten schools can be established. What would be the increase in the province's output? If it is used to run compulsory education, more than 2,000 elementary school classes can be established, educating more than 100,000 children. What would be the improvement in the province's national education? At present, there is a need for money to protect the local area everywhere. If it is used to train the people, two regiments can be established. The people in the war zone are in dire need of relief. If it is used to relieve refugees, it can maintain the lives of 300,000 people for a month. If the county party committees have a conscience, in this environment, they should stand up and impeach themselves, request cancellation, and seek other jobs to restore their credibility. There are many talents needed by the society, and there is no need to worry about the lack of ways to apply them. If we can do this, not only can we preserve the dying country, but also preserve the dying party. Our people outside the party, with a fair and forgiving heart, will not deliberately pursue it, but will sincerely support it. This depends on whether the Kuomintang party members can handle it well. As the saying goes, water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it. The people are like water. Who carries and who capsizes the Kuomintang is not the 7 million party members of different factions, but the non-partisan people who agree on right and wrong. The gentlemen in charge of the party and government, having experienced the world and gone through hardships, can understand this meaning. I hope that all sectors of the country will rise up and unanimously advocate, promote fair public opinion, and fulfill the duty of the people. Where justice lies, I am willing to be the vanguard. Since disaster has come, I dare to regret it later. The telegram is urgent and I cannot express everything I want to say.</p>
<h3>Treacherous Merchant's Private Smuggling of Inferior Goods Exposed</h3>
<p>A certain treacherous merchant in this port privately altered the packaging of 25 pieces of abalone that he had purchased and shipped them to San Francisco, USA, impersonating American goods, and shipped them to Shanghai.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Willing to Take the Position of Special Envoy for Industrial Inspection</h3>
<p>Will Go North to Take Care of Private Affairs Before Going Abroad</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Kong Xiangxi arrived in Shanghai by ship from Hong Kong at 12:00 the night before last. Our reporter made a special visit yesterday morning, but Mr. Kong was out. His secretary, Xu Jianping, received the reporter. According to Mr. Xu, Mr. Kong's trip to Hong Kong was entirely to accompany his wife on a trip to Europe and did not receive any mission from the government. He met with Mr. Hu Hanmin in Hong Kong. Mr. Hu recently suffered from blood in his stool and was unable to come to Nanjing, but his will is consistent with the central government. He also said that Mr. Kong expressed his willingness to accept the position of Special Envoy for Industrial Inspection to Europe and the United States appointed by the National Government, but he must first go north to take care of private affairs before returning to Shanghai to go abroad. It is said that Mr. Kong has many related businesses and must organize them before going abroad.</p>
<h3>Endorsements from Various Groups for General Macnaghten's Return to His Country</h3>
<p>Refuting Mr. Macnaghten's Biased Arguments</p>
<p>And Offering Sincere Advice</p>
<p>Major General Macnaghten, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, recently made biased remarks at the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting, causing a negative impression on all sectors of Shanghai society. Yesterday was Mr. Macnaghten's departure date, and the Shanghai Citizens' General Federation, the General Federation of Commercial Circles, the China National Salvation Ten-Man Group, and other organizations specially sent representatives, including Ren Jinpin, to the Customs Wharf to bid farewell. They also presented him with a joint letter from these groups, offering a rebuttal to Mr. Macnaghten's recent biased remarks and sincere advice. Mr. Macnaghten accepted the letter, which was translated from Chinese into European languages. The text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Dear Sir, After reading the reports in various Shanghai newspapers on April 14, we saw the remarks you made at the Foreign Ratepayers' Annual Meeting. These remarks have already caused a negative impact on the psychology of the Chinese people. The impact may become a problem of friendship between the Chinese and British people. Your position is not comparable to that of ordinary Englishmen. You are the outgoing Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council and also the leader of the British American Tobacco Company, the largest British company in China in terms of capital. Our association, in view of the fact that you sent letters to the U.S. Consul General on February 4 and February 6 protesting the actions of the Japanese army, greatly admires your responsibility and courage. You were able to express an unyielding spirit under the pressure of the Japanese army, fighting against the bad environment of seizing the police power of the Municipal Council and hindering the safety of the concession. Therefore, on April 13, our association and more than forty other organizations specially described this point in a public opinion published in the Continental Daily, expressing the meaning of the forgiving and believing responsible leaders of the Chinese taxpayers. Now, you voluntarily destroy this belief with one word, which is quite regrettable. Our association has made a detailed study of the remarks you made. As a result, we feel that the environment you were in on April 13 was too difficult. The foreign taxpayers who attended the meeting on that day also included Japanese people. This is why you had to abandon the fact that you sent letters to the U.S. Consul General on February 4 and February 6 protesting. As for the discussion of the cause and effect of the war, you tried your best to attack the actions of the Chinese people to resist Japanese goods, and accused the Shanghai Special District Court of ignoring such cases, thinking that it was a powerful cause. In fact, we feel that you have too little research on Chinese law and do not pay attention to the fact that the Municipal Council handles such cases. Regarding the accusation of ignoring, President Zhou Xianjue has explained the responsibility of the court on April 14 according to the provisions of Chinese law "prosecution is required". He also cited the fact that the court has tried three cases of resisting Japanese goods, proving that the court is by no means unaware. According to our association, one of the three cases was prosecuted by the police, and the first instance has already convicted the defendant. Although the defendant and the police both expressed dissatisfaction and jointly filed an appeal, the spirit of the court's responsibility can be said to be blameless. If our association abandons the concept of understanding and examines the responsibility of the Municipal Council for the recent incident with a strict attitude, we feel that the dereliction of duty of the Municipal Council cannot be washed away by anyone. The patrol room was occupied, the patrol was disarmed, and more than 800 taxpayers were missing. Chinese and foreign taxpayers cannot live and work in their tax areas. The Municipal Council has not seen any other responsible actions besides protests for this kind of incident. Even if it is known that the Japanese illegally arrested and detained innocent taxpayers, the Municipal Council has not heard of any prosecution in accordance with the law except for accepting the released persons. Our association believes that this kind of incident is very similar to the Municipal Council asking the kidnappers to release the hostages and openly allowing them to remain at large. May I ask where the spirit of the rule of law advocated by the Municipal Council is now? It has been completely destroyed. Then, why is your accusation of the court so strict, but you are lenient to the Municipal Council? Why are you so strict with the Chinese who resist Japanese goods, but so lenient to the Japanese who disrupt law and order? If you ask yourself this, you may not be able to explain it yourself. Our association loves you very much and hopes that you will not change your normal state suddenly due to the pressure of the environment, and do not be misled by Japanese propaganda and sweet words, and unknowingly destroy its position and belief in the hearts of the Chinese people. This is what our association wants to advise you with the most sincere intention to respect the spirit of justice and enhance the friendship between the Chinese and British people. Our association also has something to say. The Japanese often use the saying that "a boycott of Japanese goods is a lesson for boycotting goods from other countries" to encourage friendly countries. This kind of argument loses its value once it is explained. You should know that the goods that the Chinese first boycotted were American goods. Now, may I ask what the friendship between the Chinese and American people is like after the United States improved its policy towards China? What is the Chinese people's love for American goods like? I am afraid that the Chinese people's love for the American people and American goods today cannot be compared to any other country. This can prove that the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods is caused by the Japanese themselves, and it can also prove that the friendship between the two peoples is the foundation for the development of commerce. Therefore, you, standing under the national policy of establishing a country through commerce, have a greater need to carefully select the national diplomacy policy between China and Britain. Our association has recently compiled a book "Opinions of the Chinese People's Report to the League of Nations Investigation Team". This book is still officially signed by 700,000 people in Shanghai and sent to the League of Nations Investigation Team. Regarding the boycott of Japanese goods, there is a detailed explanation with evidence. This explanation is not only completely legal in terms of Chinese civil rights law, but also legal in terms of international conventions and the League of Nations Covenant. It is enough to help you understand the facts and uphold justice. This book is currently being reprinted and will be sent to you in a week.</p>
<h3>The Hongkou Businessmen and People Store Funds for the National Crisis</h3>
<p>A Representative Assembly Was Held Yesterday</p>
<p>A Plan Is Drafted to Contribute to the General Assembly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal All Trades National Crisis Savings Fund, which is organized for the government's long-term resistance as a backing, and various groups such as the Citizens' Federation, are actively preparing to carry it out. The businessmen and people in the Hongkou district specially convened an emergency representative meeting at 2:00 pm yesterday. The representatives of the various business associations on Broadway Road, Seward Road, Yangshupu Road, Hanbury Road, Haining Road, Tibet Road, Kaifeng Road, Wuzhou Road, Jiaxing Road, O'Kal Road, Diswei Road, Yinxiang Huade Road, Suzhou Road, Amherst Avenue, Dongyouheng Road, and Zhaofeng Road, etc., and the representatives of the fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth, fifteenth, nineteenth, twenty-ninth, thirtieth, thirty-first, thirty-third, etc. district branches of the Citizen's Association, such as Zhang Xianfang, Lin Yangzhi, Qiu Jialiang, Zhu Baoluo, Yu Yangsheng, Cheng Xiechun, Liu Zhongying, etc., were more than fifty people. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting. Regarding the issue of the National Crisis Savings Fund, after a long period of discussion, it was decided to carry out a detailed plan and contribute it to the General Assembly for adoption. The original text is recorded below: Our association, etc., sees that the four characters of long-term resistance have been spread all over the country, and the preparations for advocating long-term resistance, the so-called National Crisis Savings Fund, have also been rumored for a long time. However, it is appropriate for the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the silver and money industry and various trade associations to unite to achieve the effect of overcoming difficulties with the strength of the masses. It is not just empty talk, and it is not what the people of Shanghai would do. (1) Storage methods: (A) The first priority is the letter of agreement. It is necessary to designate a bank or money shop as the place for storage. The people's groups have the power to supervise and audit. If possible, the military and political authorities will be united to discuss the purchase method and then announce it to the people. After there is no objection, it will be used. The storage interest rate is different from ordinary ones. It must be extra generous to maintain the national crisis and show great faith. (B) Audit report, or decide to report every few days, it must be exposed by the accountant through the custody committee, or every month, please have the people appointed to audit it with the accountant custody committee to show that it is verified. (2) Donation methods: Generally, direct storage is taken to avoid accidental abuses. (A) The store draws a savings fund, which is calculated every ten days, or every few days, and draws a certain amount from the business items to use as a savings fund. The Commercial Federation and the Municipal Federation of each road are responsible for supervising the storage of each store and checking the income of the business place to emphasize the actual report. (B) Salary draws a savings fund, regardless of whether the workers are in factories or shops, those above 20 yuan must draw a certain amount as a savings fund, and so on. If there are other allowances for travel, they must be drawn. (C) Free savings fund, a safe deposit box must be set up. This box must be made by a designated bank, and the key is also kept by the bank. If there is no bank on the road, more safe deposit boxes can be set up to allow people to store freely. This is a sporadic deposit without receipts. The opening of the box must be accompanied by the custody committee for supervision. (D) Rent savings fund is the most powerful percentage. If the owners of various industries can make a patriotic decision, drawing a certain percentage of the rent items to use as a savings fund, the whole city can be very impressive, making long-term resistance extremely easy to prepare. A thorough investigation of Chinese property is required to be qualified, and foreign businessmen are not included in this example. Looking at the above donation methods in general, if they are implemented, the percentage will be tens of millions. The so-called unity of purpose is like a fortress, accumulating sand into a tower, and gathering fur into a robe. I hope that people in the world will be of one mind and one mind to save the country, so that the preparations for long-term resistance will not lag behind. As far as the limited views of our association, etc., we dare to briefly describe the opinions of the savings fund. I also hope that patriotic people will not hesitate to give advice and work together to plan it.</p>
<h3>The War Affairs Office Invited the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Accountants' Association invited the press at the Bank Association Club at 5:00 pm yesterday. Dozens of reporters from various newspapers were present. Wu Huanru, the section chief of the second section of the Social Affairs Bureau, reported on the war damage registration survey. Because most of the victims in the war zone have not registered, it is hoped that the press will promote it so that they can join the registration. Accountant Jiang Wanping then reported that the people in the war zone generally do not come to register because they think that even if they register, whether they will be compensated in the future is still a problem. In fact, the purpose of our registration is not compensation. Therefore, we can make the investigation accurate and detailed, which is convenient for our country's foreign propaganda, and can improve the international status, so that the Japanese will not slander our country as an unorganized country. Moreover, this survey is completely free, and even postage can be exempted. It is still hoped that the people in the war zone will go to the association to obtain forms to fill out and report (the association is located on the third floor of No. 4 Hong Kong Road), etc. It was dismissed at 6:00.</p>
<h3>The Negotiation on the Jing'an Temple Incense Market on the Buddha's Birthday Has Ended</h3>
<p>Jing'an Temple Strives for Restrictions on Setting up</p>
<p>Stalls from the Municipal Council and Successfully Solves the Problem</p>
<p>Jing'an Ancient Temple is the only scenic spot in Shanghai, with many ancient sites and a grand scale. It was built in the Sun Wu Dynasty, from the Han Dynasty to the present. Every year on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, which is the birthday of the Tathagata Buddha (the Buddha's Birthday), the temple usually holds a grand incense market. Thousands of villagers from the mainland gather to set up stalls to sell domestic goods and local products at low prices and good quality. The business is quite large, reaching more than 10 million yuan. Those who look up to the scenic spots, worship the Buddha and offer incense, and purchase goods are crowded and blocked. The enthusiasm is rare in the whole country. Last year, the Municipal Council, on the grounds that the incense market hindered traffic, initiated a proposal to restrict the setting up of stalls. After the temple and various groups and gentry tried their best to argue, the Municipal Council postponed the implementation. Last year, the Buddha's Birthday was still held as usual without restrictions. However, after the grand meeting, the Jing'an Temple was informed that the restrictions would be enforced this year. Abbot Shi Zhifa of Jing'an Temple still protested and negotiated with the Municipal Council. Local gentry Gong Yifei and Xu Wenyuan also enthusiastically assisted. The stallholders in the incense market also jointly petitioned. The temple and the Municipal Council negotiated for years and argued several times. The Municipal Council began to respect the lease signed by the former Jing'an Temple and to sympathize with the livelihood of the common people. Therefore, the restriction method was changed, and the stall setting date was increased to seven days. The location is still the same as the old example. Only the expansion of the location and date and new stallholders are restricted. The old stallholders are not affected at all. A incense market ordinance was specially formulated by both parties. After several revisions, both parties were satisfied. Therefore, the abbot Zhifa of Jing'an Temple and the gentry Gong Yifei and Xu Wenyuan went to the Municipal Council and the Chinese directors to exchange procedures and agreed on the stall setting map. Both parties also signed and sealed. The major case of the Buddha's Birthday Incense Market has come to an end. The stall setting regulations will be continued in the future.</p>
<h3>Reconstruction</h3>

<h3>Securities and Gold Industries Do Not Collect Margin in Advance</h3>
<p>One Person Falsely Establishes More Than Ten Accounts</p>
<p>Pocketing the Profits and Ignoring the Losses</p>
<p>Shareholders of Yuansheng Accuse the Manager</p>
<p>Of Breach of Trust and Embezzlement of Huge Sums</p>
<p>The shareholders of Yuansheng, Yu Shouzheng, Chen Taisheng, Luo Kunxiang, Cao Jiansan, etc., recently hired lawyer Zhang Shizhao and filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against the general manager of the company, Shi Zian, the manager Song Fuchen, and Tian Hongnian, etc., for breach of trust and embezzlement of huge sums. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye opened a court hearing to collect information. The defendant Tian Hongnian did not arrive, but Shi and Song, accompanied by their lawyers Xu Bingcheng, Xu Fuke, Yuan Yang'an, etc., appeared in court. The plaintiff Yu Shouzheng claimed that four years ago, he and the three defendants raised ten shares, each share worth 5,000 taels, and jointly opened Yuansheng to engage in securities, gold, and other businesses. Shi accounted for 25% of the shares and served as the general manager, responsible for all internal and external affairs. All business income and expenses were under his sole control. He accounted for one and a half shares because Shi was his sister's husband and the manager of Zhonghui Bank, so he secretly directed Yuansheng's business. Song accounted for one share and served as the manager. After Shi Zian verbally reported that the business was suspended on November 7 last year, he privately used the name of Zhongji to deal with Hongxiang Money Shop and withdrew all the cash deposited in Yuansheng in his personal name. On the 20th, he privately absconded. On the 27th, he sent a letter from the post office with the words "outlaw". The people felt that something was wrong and went to the company to investigate and found out about the cash withdrawal from Hongxiang Money Shop. On the 26th, they went to the money shop to intercept the deposit and guaranteed to withdraw a total of more than 22,000 taels of silver. Shi Zian sent a letter on the 27th instructing his partners to privately withdraw and divide the remaining money from Hongxiang. Fortunately, it was after the interception. After the people settled the accounts, they were shocked to learn that during the period when Shi Zian was in charge of the business, all the public bonds bought and sold on behalf of customers did not collect margin in advance according to the regulations of the exchange, and colluded with Tian Hongnian to falsely establish accounts. He violated the business practice that one person cannot establish three accounts, and even falsely established more than ten accounts for one person. If there was a profit, he would withdraw it at any time. If there was a loss, he would ignore it. As a result, Yuansheng owed Zhonghui Bank more than 200,000 yuan, and Tian owed Yuansheng a huge debt. After offsetting each other, there was a profit and no loss. Obviously, he used the qualification of the manager of Zhonghui Bank to fully lend money to Yuansheng, secretly colluded with Shi Zian, and then privately borrowed it from Yuansheng. Yuansheng became an organ for Shi Zian and Tian Hongnian to collude and do evil. After the facts were exposed, Shi fled, and Tian also deliberately disappeared. The people were forced to be unable to do anything. In order to protect business credit, the plaintiffs had to pay off all the debts owed by Yuansheng to Zhonghui on behalf of the plaintiffs. Song Fuchen, as the manager, did not report the perpetrators, so they jointly filed a lawsuit and attached a civil lawsuit, requesting the court to order the defendants to pay the amount of the debt paid by the plaintiffs and bear the interest calculated at the market rate from December 31 to the end of the execution, etc. Judge Qian asked Shi and Song briefly and adjourned the case because Tian Hongnian did not arrive and the case could not proceed. He ordered Tian to be summoned for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>A Chilean Merchant Buys the Xin Ningxing Ship of the Sanbei Company</h3>
<p>The Original Workers' Company Is Willing to Introduce Them</p>
<p>The Xin Ningxing ship of the Sanbei Company, which runs on the Yangtze River, has been repaired in the Shanghai Shipyard since the end of last year and will be completed soon. All the crew members, the tea room Li Ada, etc., 79 people, said that the ship has now been sold by the company to the Chilean East Asia Company and renamed the Xin Daji ship, and the original workers will be dismissed. Therefore, the workers have requested the trade union to negotiate for reinstatement. After receiving the report from the trade union, the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to mediate. It is heard that the general manager of the company, Yu Qiaqing, has agreed to try to introduce the original workers as much as possible to avoid unemployment, etc.</p>
<h3>St. John's Alumni Academic Research Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the St. John's University Alumni Association held its first academic research conference at the Fanwangdu Club at 12:00 noon yesterday. More than 100 alumni attended, including Liu Hongsheng, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Renzhi, Wu Qingtai, Lu Yiming, Ruan Fengren, Yang Runsheng, Gu Fuqing, Xiao Zhiji, Sun Jialu, Rong Baoqi, and Chen Heqin. Chairman Zhong Keto delivered the opening remarks and reported that Dr. Wu Jingxiong could not attend today due to business. Then, he introduced Dr. Baker, Director of Transportation of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, to speak on "The Past and Present of Disaster Relief in China." In the past, the drought in the north used work-for-relief to build roads and water conservancy projects in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces. This time, the unprecedented flood in the Yangtze River used 430,000 tons of American wheat to repair embankments, using 2 million refugees. 85% of the embankment work has been completed. It is now planned to continue to borrow 200,000 tons of wheat from the United States to build the Changsha-Shanghai road and branch roads to facilitate transportation, rebuild rural prosperity and commercial industry, and maintain security, etc. Finally, Chairman Zhong Keto reported on the recent progress of the career introduction department and hoped that all alumni who are unemployed or need talents will contact each other at any time in the spirit of mutual assistance. He also said that the academic research conference will be held once every month or two.</p>

<h3>Verdict on the Prosperous Litigation Case</h3>
<p>Both Appeals Are Dismissed</p>
<p>The descendants of the late Sheng Xuanhuai, Sheng Ze Cheng and his children and grandchildren, were previously accused by their nephews Lin Fengwen and Fengjun of encroaching on the estate of the late Zhuang Tai, while the Shengs and others claimed that the two Lins had no right to inherit the estate and filed a counterclaim, requesting that the plaintiffs be prosecuted for false accusations. As a result of the trial, both sides' lawsuits were rejected. As for the private lawsuit attached by the Lins, it was handled by the Immigration Court. Unexpectedly, both parties refused to accept the verdict and filed appeals separately. The opening of the trial has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the verdict in this case. At that time, Judge Zhou of the First Special District Court, together with two juror judges, ascended the seat and announced the verdict, rejecting both parties' appeals.</p>
<h3>Harassment of Female Shop Assistants</h3>
<p>The Escort Was Beaten and Injured</p>
<p>Daichunlin Rongji Department Store at No. 80 Ximen Road in the French Concession has recently been thriving, and female customers are still the majority. In order to adapt to the times, the manager of the store hired six female employees to facilitate female customers. However, the general staff members live at home and come early and leave late every day. It is unexpected that some nearby hooligans, such as Zhang Yongcai's son Zhang Changlin, Jin Xiaowuzi (living at No. 2 Baer Road), Li Shijie (living at No. 57 Xihufang), etc., admire the beauty of the female employees and often make frivolous harassment. The manager of the store, for fear of causing trouble, carefully sends male employees to escort each female employee to and from work every morning and evening. Zhang, etc., saw that someone was escorting them and could not implement their harassment methods, so they resented the escorts. A female employee, Zhu Huihui, 16 years old, lives at No. 71 Xihufang. On the evening of the 31st of last month at 8:00 pm, she was escorted home by a male colleague, Zhou Maoyin. Unexpectedly, Zhang and the other three had learned about it in advance and were waiting in the dark place in Xihufang Alley. Seeing Zhou and Zhu entering the alley, they went forward and grabbed Zhou and beat him severely without asking any questions. Zhu ran home and called her family to catch up, but Zhang, etc., had already fled. Zhu's mother sent Zhou to the hospital for treatment. After being discharged from the hospital, Zhou immediately hired lawyer Liu Shiqi to file a private prosecution with the Second Special District Court against Zhang Changlin and the other three for the crime of injury under Article 293 of the Criminal Law, requesting an investigation. After approval, Judge Cao Jun opened a criminal court yesterday afternoon to collect information. First, the plaintiff Zhou Maoyin described the circumstances of the beating at the time, and Zhu Huihui testified to the brutal beating of the three defendants. Only Li Shijie, the defendant, arrived in court and denied committing the crime together. Zhang Changlin and Jin Xiaowuzi beat him, and I was dissuading him and did not help. The first and second defendants did not arrive. A lawyer represented them in court to defend them. The court ordered to reschedule the hearing after summoning the two defendants.</p>

<p>Letters</p>
<p>Dear Editor, In your newspaper on the 18th of this month, there was a news item about our bureau's epidemic prevention. After investigation, it does not conform to the facts. The corrections are as follows: (1) All the expenses of our bureau have always been submitted to the Municipal Government for allocation from the municipal expenses. The epidemic prevention expenses for this year have also been submitted as planned. The amount of work is determined according to the amount of funds allocated. Our bureau has no intention to raise funds by itself. What your newspaper said, "If the allocation of funds is not enough, we have to raise funds from all walks of life," is not the truth. (2) This year, Shanghai Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Cixangyinghang, Zhenru, and Pusong, etc., have been invaded by the Japanese army, resulting in an unprecedented military disaster. The people's economy is on the verge of collapse. The unsanitary environment will inevitably increase. Epidemics are easy to invade and spread. Therefore, this year's epidemic prevention is more urgent than in previous years, the work is more complicated, and the expenses have also increased. However, the estimated expenses reported are 75,590 yuan. What your newspaper said, "And the epidemic prevention expenses of 100,000 yuan have been set," does not conform to the facts. (3) Although our bureau has submitted the summer and autumn seasonal epidemic plan for implementation this year to the Municipal Government for approval on April 4, it is still waiting for instructions. We can only prepare for implementation after receiving instructions for allocation of funds. What your newspaper said, "It has been decided to implement it from the 1st of next month," is not a fact. Please publish it in the news column to correct the errors of the 18th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, The correction letter about Qihua Company employees demanding wages, published in your newspaper on the 19th, is inconsistent with the facts in its wording. After investigating on the 12th, the employee representatives forced the company to open for business. After the cash was sold, the wages up to the end of March, more than 5,000 yuan, were forced to be taken the next morning. The arrears of wages have been cleared. The persons who demanded on the 16th were severance payments and full monthly wages for April, etc., which were beyond the requirements. They ordered that they be paid in advance within a limited time and did not allow the deduction of the goods owed. Without waiting for a reply, they threatened to go on strike. The facts are complete and there is evidence to be preserved. Moreover, the goods owed are debts. The liquidator has already published an advertisement urging repayment. Why can it be said that there is no notification? Other kinds of violence and coercion are temporarily omitted. This letter is specially sent to you, hoping to make corrections. Sincerely, Shanghai Qihua Co., Ltd. Liquidation Office, April 19.</p>

<p>Expected to Stay in the Eastern Provinces for Four Weeks</p>
<p>(Beiping) The investigation team left Beiping at 10:30 PM tonight, still using the special train they arrived on. The seating arrangement inside the train remained the same. The train carried 28 boxes of food, sufficient for one month's use. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lord Lytton and Gu Weijun traveled together on the Haiqi warship. The Japanese representative and Claudel Hyni traveled on a Japanese warship to Dalian. Upon arrival in Shenyang, they will immediately begin the investigation work and will definitely not accept the hospitality of the puppet state. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The delegation left Beiping at 10:00 PM tonight, taking the Beining Railway special train to the Northeast. Because the Japanese side opposed Chinese special trains going beyond Yuguan, after arriving at Qinhuangdao, the investigation team members and Chinese and Japanese representatives will all transfer to warships to Dalian and then transfer to the South Manchurian Railway to Shenyang. Lord Lytton plans to travel with the German and French representatives on a British warship. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The investigation team is scheduled to leave Beiping at 9:00 PM tonight. One group, led by the American and Italian representatives along with a portion of the staff, will travel along the Beining Railway directly through Yuguan, inspecting the Jinzhou and Dahushan areas along the way to reach Shenyang. The other group, led by Lord Lytton and the French and German representatives along with Gu Weijun and a portion of the staff, will first take the Beining Railway to Yuguan, then transfer at Qinhuangdao to the Haiqi warship to Dalian, and then transfer to the South Manchurian Railway to meet in Shenyang. Lord Lytton intends to travel on a British warship with the German and French representatives. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The League of Nations investigation team will leave Beiping for Manchuria at 10:00 PM tonight, but the entire group will only go as far as Qinhuangdao. At that time, the two attendants and staff members will disembark from the train and take the sea route to Dalian. Dr. Gu and his staff will take the Chinese cruiser Haiqi to Dalian, while the Japanese attendants will take a Japanese destroyer. The five investigators decided on their respective routes by drawing lots. Therefore, Lord Lytton will travel with Dr. Gu, General Claudel will travel with the Japanese attendants, and Dr. Hyni will take another Japanese destroyer to Dalian. General McCoy and Lord Markodi will travel by train to Shenyang. The train will not stop at any stations along the way and is expected to arrive directly in Shenyang tomorrow evening. The sea voyage to Dalian will take eight to ten hours, so those traveling by sea will probably not arrive in Shenyang until the morning of the 21st. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Announcement of the Investigation Team's Itinerary</p>
<p>(Beiping) The investigation team announced its itinerary, stating that after arriving in the Northeast, it will stay for four weeks to conduct investigation work, and then go to Japan via Korea.

<h3>Final Decision on Route Out of the Pass</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Representative Gu received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that, according to the League of Nations resolution of December last year, the investigation team has the freedom to choose its route. If the team intends to travel by sea, we do not need to insist. At the same time, because the Executive Yuan is scheduled to meet on May 1st, a brief report must be drafted beforehand. The team does not want the trip to the Northeast to be delayed due to route issues, which would affect the work. Therefore, the final decision was made that at 10:00 PM on the 19th, they would still take the Beining Railway special train from Beiping. The next morning, they would arrive in Qinhuangdao, where the British, French, and German commissioners, along with the Chinese and Japanese representatives, would transfer to warships to Dalian. The Italian and American commissioners will continue to advance and meet in Shenyang. However, it is still possible that the decision to take the sea route may change at that time.

<h3>Gao Jiyi Accompanies the Special Train to Take Care</h3>

<h3>Gu Weijun's Reply to Zhang Taiyan's Letter</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Gu Weijun's reply to Zhang Taiyan's letter states: "Recently, the trend of laxity has become prevalent, and scholars lack integrity. I have always felt ashamed of this. Reading your letter, I see the seeking of a virtuous response, which is naturally so. The encouragement is even more profound, which is deeply touching. I often examine my responsibilities and those of the investigation commissioners. One is to seek the completion of the mission, and the other is to protect the dignity of the mission. Going out of the Pass is still part of the mission, and the preservation of dignity depends on it. The mission will only be completed after the entire report of the investigation team is drafted, prepared, and sent. That the report must be beneficial to our country is what I pray for day and night and strive to achieve. What is the mission of going out of the Pass? Is it not to seek the on-the-spot and detailed investigation by the commissioners, and to expose all the disguises made by the other party to the fullest extent, so that there is no ambiguity? The instigation of traitors to reject, and all kinds of intimidation, are within expectations. Today, I have not said a word that I would not go, and none of the commissioners has said that they would not go. This is because after receiving the order, we have an inescapable responsibility. However, before the danger arrives, there is no room for hesitation or deliberation. Once the danger arrives, we must allow detailed arrangements. Why? Let us consider the status of the Eastern Provinces today. If they are occupied by the Japanese military, then they claim there is a puppet government. If they are occupied by traitors, then the Japanese army can run rampant outside the South Manchurian Railway line. The Japanese and traitors collude, acting in concert. The integrity of my person and the honor of the country are tied together. The safety of the investigation commissioners and the responsibility of the country are tied together. The issue is complex and involves too much. There are things that must be requested from the government and things that must be challenged to the League of Nations. External rumors are not enough to move the ears of the virtuous. Once preparations are complete, we will naturally depart. As the poem says, 'Until the sky is dark and rainy, it soaks the mulberry lands. Let us bind and brace the windows and doors.' This is what it means. I am sending someone ahead to deliver this message. I hope you will instruct me on any omissions. I wish you good health." (19th Dispatch)</p>

(19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Wang Delin's division of National Salvation Army arrived at Suifenhe and immediately set up headquarters there. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Xi Qia's army in Bin County and on the eastern Harbin-Suifen line is preparing both red and yellow armbands.

<p>(Harbin) The former Jilin army, supplemented by armored trains, set out from Shitouhezi this morning. The Manchurian army destroyed a section of the railway track near Weisha River, but after a nine-hour traffic stoppage, the Railway Bureau has repaired it. (18th Reuters Dispatch) (Shenyang) According to news from Yanbian, the area from Yimianpo to Hailanpao Railway, approximately 240 miles long, is completely in chaos. The Japanese estimate that the damage caused by unofficial Chinese armies and others is worth 20,000,000 yuan and will take four years to restore to its original state. The main victims are Chinese, followed by Koreans, and then Japanese. Japanese residents in Suifenhe are now taking refuge in Russia. The Japanese consul has been permitted by the Soviet authorities to allow Japanese residents to enter Russia. According to news from Harbin, Japanese residents in Daheihe are also entering Russia to take refuge. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wanbaoshan Under Siege by Righteous Army</h3>

<h3>Righteous Armies Rising Up in Taonan and Other Places</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) Many incidents have occurred in Manchuria today. Taking advantage of the Japanese army's weak forces and the fact that they are transferring reinforcements, the Righteous Armies are simultaneously launching uprisings in Taonan, Tongliao, Zhengjiatun, and other places. Therefore, the main force of the Japanese army south of Shenyang is now rushing to the above areas. An incident has also occurred in Yanbian, and a Japanese unit has been dispatched to Dunhua. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Young Woman Serves as Commander in the National Salvation Army</h3>
<p>(Harbin) There is a young woman commander in the National Salvation Army in Hengdaohezi who has set up a headquarters there.

<h3>Yu Zhishan's Troops Maintain Order in Shenyang</h3>

Sandbags are piled up next to the police watchtowers in Shenyang, making the city even more uneasy. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government's Suspicion of Russia Slightly Relieved</h3>
<p>(Moscow) News from Tokyo that criticized the Russian Foreign Minister's actions regarding the Chinese consul in Hailanpao is being given considerable importance in newspapers here today. The Russian Foreign Minister used coded telegrams to transmit Ma Zhanshan's declaration to various countries, so they requested the recall of the consul. The report claims that a representative of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told a TASS correspondent that the Russian Foreign Minister's action has indeed dispelled the suspicion that there is any connection between Soviet Russia and Ma Zhanshan. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although there is alarming news of Russian-Japanese tension in Northern Manchuria, Reuters has learned today that the Japanese government is currently taking a calm view of the situation and does not anticipate any serious developments. It is rumored that there are many international speculators in the Three Eastern Provinces, so there is a seed of doubt in Japanese intentions. It seems that the Japanese suspicion of Soviet Russia is equally unfounded. The Second Division will leave Harbin tomorrow and be stationed in Liaoyang, 40 miles south of Shenyang. This move may indicate that the Japanese military authorities deeply believe that there is no danger of a Russian-Japanese conflict. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Cables Military Organs Not to Impose Overlapping Taxes in Addition to Consolidated Taxes</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 19th, the Ministry of Finance cabled various military organs, stating that it has recently been discovered that in various places, additional taxes are still being levied on various goods for which the Central Government has already collected consolidated taxes, using various pretexts. The consolidated tax system is based on the principle of not imposing overlapping taxes. If there are overlapping taxes, the National Government will, as a rule, refund them. At present, during this time of national crisis, the Central Government's finances are extremely depleted. Apart from customs and salt taxes, which have been designated for specific purposes, the Treasury's income relies solely on the consolidated tax. If tax collection is slightly obstructed, the overall situation will be affected. It is hoped that you will do your best to stop this, in order to enrich the national treasury and relieve the people's plight. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Disarmament Conference Passes Gradual Limitation Proposal</h3>
<p>Revised Text of the First Clause of the Draft Treaty National 19th, Geneva telegram: This morning, the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference unanimously passed the resolution for the gradual limitation and reduction of armaments. This proposal will be incorporated into the first clause of the Disarmament Convention. However, it was only passed after some intense debate this morning, indicating that the delegates, while supporting this resolution, still did not fully agree on the fundamental ideas. Among them, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov had the most intense verbal battle, and they exchanged witty remarks about the interruption of the Soviet-Romanian non-aggression treaty negotiations.</p>
<p>National 18th, Geneva telegram: The Drafting Committee of the Disarmament Conference, upon the suggestion of the American delegate, today rewrote the first clause of the Disarmament Convention draft. Its content was generally changed to state that the reduction of armaments as stipulated in Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant can only be fully achieved after taking a big step forward before the start of this conference, and then making progressive modifications at appropriate intervals. It also stipulates that universal reduction should tend towards the lowest possible level given the circumstances. Currently, twelve committee members, including Russia, Turkey, and Germany, have accepted this new clause, with only Czechoslovakia and Japan having slight objections.</p>
<p>Reuters 18th, Geneva telegram: The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference started work today. German delegate Dr. Nadolny stated that the most important thing is to implement disarmament within the scope of Article 8 of the Covenant. Germany cannot agree with the mechanical disarmament methods proposed by the Russian delegate Litvinov, but can agree with the principle of proportional reduction. The views of the representatives of various countries gradually converged, and representatives from Belgium, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Norway, Estonia, and Uruguay proposed a draft resolution advocating for gradual reduction of armaments, to be revised frequently in the shortest possible time. This proposal was accepted by the delegates, but Russian delegate Litvinov opposed the mention of the League of Nations in the resolution, as the Soviet Union is not a member of the League of Nations. He argued that the first step should be a substantial reduction. British delegate Simon agreed with the principle of this proposal, saying that more concrete wording could be used to replace the phrase "shortest possible time," as this phrase could be misinterpreted.</p>
<p>National News Agency 19th, Geneva telegram: The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference convened at 10:15 this morning and immediately began discussing a new resolution clarifying the purpose of the Disarmament Conference. It was then put to a show of hands and passed unanimously. However, the Soviet and Romanian representatives had a fierce debate. Subsequently, the representatives of Romania, Persia, Yugoslavia, and Argentina took the stage one after another to explain that their support for the resolution was attached to an understanding, namely, that this proposal was related to another resolution, which would stipulate that armaments must be reduced to the lowest level consistent with national security, and that international affairs must be carried out unanimously through joint action. Soviet representative Litvinov rose to oppose, strongly arguing about the obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. Then, the committee members began discussing the standards for limiting and reducing armaments, and that the special circumstances of each country should be considered together, and military strength should be calculated based on what is absolutely necessary to maintain domestic order and what is relatively necessary to ensure national defense. Unexpectedly, Sir Angell, in his first speech, insisted that in the first phase of disarmament, the geographical location of each country and the military situation of neighboring countries must be taken into account. Japanese representative Sato expressed his dissent to this view, stating that the circumstances of each country are different and cannot be governed by a single standard. Therefore, the restriction of air forces cannot be imposed on each country in the same way, because the air forces of several countries are not yet complete enough to be compared with other countries. The Japanese delegate also stated that the treaty expected to be achieved by this Disarmament Conference should be based on the League of Nations Covenant, and that any deficiencies in the League of Nations Covenant regarding the disarmament issue should be remedied. Chinese delegate Liu Wentao then rose to request that the armaments of all countries should be reduced to the lowest limit, and that the size of each country's territory should be the standard for the size of the disarmament. Liu also mentioned the memorandum previously submitted by China, which stated that the disarmament situation should be based on whether neighboring countries have aggressive ambitions. If neighboring countries have peaceful relations, then military preparedness can be lighter. When Liu reached this point in his speech, Soviet representative Litvinov stood up and said, "I don't know when this kind of meeting can be completed, nor do I know when it can begin to be implemented. I only hear countries arguing over various conditions." The Russian delegate had already predicted that if this Disarmament Conference does not adopt the Soviet proposal, it will be difficult to succeed. When Litvinov finished his speech, the translator was about to begin translating when American delegate Stimson gracefully stopped him. It was 12:10 pm. Stimson stopped in the corridor and chatted with old friends. After Spanish delegate Madariaga finished his speech, he entered the meeting hall and took a seat in the seat of American delegate Gibson. Then, the eyes of the entire hall turned to focus on Stimson. The delegates went to greet him. Later, German delegate Nadolny and Persian delegate Ala gave speeches one after another. Stimson listened attentively to Gibson and asked questions, and focused on the figures in the hall, only listening attentively to the speech of French delegate Paul-Boncour. Finally, Chairman Henderson appointed a drafting committee to draft a resolution on the standards for reducing armaments, with a deadline of 10:00 am on Wednesday to report to the General Commission. The General Commission will also convene a meeting on Wednesday morning.</p>
<h3>Litvinov Denies Concentration of Red Army on the Border</h3>
<p>But the Serious Situation is Indeed a Fact</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Has No Window</p>
<p>For Bandits to Enter</p>
<p>Russian Newspaper Issues Another Warning to Japan</p>
<p>National 18th, Geneva telegram: The spokesman for the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, today firmly denied the rumors in Tokyo that the Soviet Union was increasing troops on the Manchurian border and that the CCP had bombed the East Road Railway, causing a Japanese military train to derail. However, he said that the serious situation is indeed a fact, and we cannot hide it. The Japanese and the Japanese-influenced Manchus are currently inciting White Russians, creating disturbances. However, we are doing our utmost to maintain strict neutrality during this critical period.</p>
<p>National 18th, Moscow telegram: Moscow today admitted to concentrating large forces on the Far Eastern border and making thorough preparations for national defense, but the actual number of troops sent to the Far East was not announced. The Pravda newspaper of the Communist Youth League issued a warning, stating that the Soviet Union is not dull or numb and can be attacked without being aware of it. It said that those hired bandits should know that the Soviet Union has no window for thieves to enter without danger. Currently, the Russians are observing the actions of General Ma Zhanshan with a different perspective, believing that Ma is secretly instigated by the Japanese to pretend to revolt, intending to allow the Japanese army to take the opportunity to garrison the northern Manchurian border and attack the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through the Chinese Consul in Hailar, has sent a telegram on behalf of Ma, requesting the puppet government of Manchuria to recall him. In addition, the Communist Party newspaper Izvestia also had strong words about the demonstrations by White Russians in Harbin in front of Soviet organizations, solemnly stating that the White Russians' repeated provocations against the Soviet Union continue unabated and are all instigated and condoned by the Japanese. Japan must bear the responsibility. It also stated that the Japanese newspapers are consistently distorting the facts in an attempt to mislead the people about the Soviet Union, so they have never published a word about the Soviet Union's refusal to allow Russians to join the Far Eastern dispute and all denials of anti-Soviet slander, nor have they paid any attention to it, clearly wanting to create public opinion for military expansion in the country and lead its people into a new war. Pravda also stated that the Soviet people are currently being severely tortured by the Japanese in Manchurian prisons, causing even greater outrage in Russian public opinion.</p>
<p>Reuters 19th, London telegram: All London newspapers this morning used large headlines to report on the relationship between Japan and Russia, predicting that the result of Soviet troop deployments on the border and mutual suspicion would cause conflict between the two sides. However, the consensus is that neither Japan nor Russia wants to take hostile action at this time, and therefore it may not reach a dangerous point.</p>
<h3>Turkey May Join the League of Nations</h3>
<h3>But with Reservations</h3>
<p>National 19th, Geneva telegram: Informed sources this morning predicted that Turkey is expected to join the League of Nations soon. Before leaving to return home, Turkish Foreign Minister Rushdi had a long talk with League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond last night. It is said that Rushdi indicated that Turkey would no longer insist on a seat on the Permanent Council as a condition for joining, and that with regard to Article 16 of the Covenant, which imposes sanctions on aggressor nations, it should have the right to submit the same reservations as Germany. Drummond had previously sounded out the opinions of the members on this matter, and last night he indicated to the Turkish Foreign Minister that this would not be an obstacle to Turkey's joining the League of Nations. Rushdi's return to Ankara this time is to discuss this matter with Prime Minister Ismet. If agreed, the League of Nations will formally invite Turkey to join.</p>
<h3>Attempted Bombing of Indian Governor Fails</h3>
<p>Indian Muslims in New Clash</p>
<p>Reuters 19th, North West Frontier telegram: Someone attempted to destroy a train carrying the Indian Governor with a homemade bomb, but failed. When the border postal train passed through the area, the bomb exploded in a river, but the train was not damaged and no one was injured. Three Indians have now been arrested. The Indian Governor, Lord Willingdon, is currently inspecting the North West Frontier.</p>
<p>Reuters 18th, Calcutta telegram: A nationalist clash occurred today in the small town of Narhat Tipu, not far from here, resulting in one death and twenty injuries. The reason is that Hindu landlords did not allow their Muslim tenants to slaughter cattle during Eid al-Adha, as Hindus consider cattle to be sacred. As a result, the two sides quarreled. Before long, the Hindus placed a dead pig outside the Muslim mosque. Muslims regard pigs as unclean, and a major clash broke out with the Hindus. The police tried their best to suppress the conflict and arrested thirty-seven people. The disturbance subsided.</p>

<p>Reuters 19th, Tokyo telegram: The cabinet decided to convene a special session of parliament on May 23rd, which will last for two weeks.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency 19th, Tokyo telegram: The Minseito Party, regarding the government's decision on the date of the special session, stated that this session is actually an opportunity to fulfill the promises made by the Seiyukai Party during the election. The session should last at least three weeks, but the current decision of two weeks is actually suppressing freedom of speech and is extremely inappropriate. Although the session is short, the party will focus on financial issues, as well as issues of loyalty and election interference, and will use all its strength to put forward a general vote of no confidence to impeach the government. The party is currently formulating its battle plan.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Ammunition Depot Explodes</h3>
<p>Destroying More Than 300 Houses</p>
<p>Cause Due to Spontaneous Combustion</p>
<p>Reuters 18th, Tokyo telegram: An army ammunition bureau outside Tokyo exploded this morning, causing great panic among nearby residents, injuring several people, and destroying more than 50 houses. The other losses are also considerable. The explosion was due to spontaneous combustion.</p>
<p>A follow-up telegram said: Eight people were injured and 300 houses were damaged, but most of them were just shattered glass windows.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency 19th, Tokyo telegram: At around 6:00 AM this morning, Ammunition Stack No. 72 of the Takigawa Army Ammunition Depot under the jurisdiction of Tokyo Prefecture first made an extremely loud noise, followed by a large explosion. After about five seconds, there was a second large explosion, and small explosions continued until 7:30 AM, when there was a third large explosion. The ammunition depot was completely destroyed. The roof tiles and window glass of fifty households in the vicinity were completely destroyed, and more than 300 other households also suffered considerable damage. Residents in the vicinity were very surprised and at a loss because the incident occurred early in the morning. Five or six people were injured. The internal losses of the depot are currently unclear. The cause of the explosion may be that rain entered through the windows yesterday, causing the gunpowder to spontaneously explode. A detailed investigation is currently underway.</p>

<h3>British Budget Announced</h3>
<p>Reuters 19th, London telegram: Today is the day for the budget to be announced. Many people in London got up early or stayed up all night. One of them was a certain Conservative Party member of parliament, who was pacing outside the parliament building from midnight yesterday to secure a seat in the House of Commons. After the doors of the parliament opened at 8:00 AM, 29 other members of parliament and those who had waited all night entered. Among these 30 people, there were four women. They all chose good seats to sit down, because the seats in the House of Commons cannot accommodate all the members of parliament. Important News</p>
<h3>Russian-American Cooperation Has a Great Impact on the League of Nations</h3>
<p>President of Moscow Sun Yat-sen University Advocates Russian-American Alliance Shanghai Daily News, Geneva Telegram: US Secretary of State Stimson's visit to Europe is gradually leading to the resolution of the Disarmament Conference, the Compensation Conference, and other issues. In particular, the sudden and drastic change in attitude towards Russia has attracted considerable attention from European countries. The Labor-Peasant delegation currently active in Geneva stated that, at the latest by the Eshtim Festival, they will promote absolute pacifism in Manchuria. As for the Red Army's concentration on the Sino-Russian border, they vehemently denied it. However, before and after Stimson left the United States, troops continued to be sent to the Far East border. On one hand, regarding Manchuria, due to the shared stance of the United States and Russia, they strongly advocated the possibility of Russian-American cooperation, thereby giving Japan a great shock. However, the cadres of the Third International severely criticized the government's policy towards Japan for being inclined towards appeasement, believing that it would not be easy for the United States to extend a hand to the Soviet Union after having repeatedly constrained it. However, on the 17th, Chinese Foreign Minister Luo Wengan decided to announce the revival of Sino-Russian relations, stating that without waiting for the military assistance of the United States and Russia, restoring trade relations with Russia would be beneficial to China. Therefore, observing the attitude of the United States and restoring diplomatic relations with Russia is an urgent issue. Therefore, our government believes that the situation is serious, and on the 18th, Cabinet Secretary-General Mori visited Minister of War Araki to discuss the state of alert in North Manchuria. Recently, the Japanese government has been paying close attention to the warnings issued by Russia to Japan, Russian public opinion, and the consultations between Stimson and Litvinov in Geneva. Even the atmosphere among the Allied powers has become tense as a result.</p>
<p>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published a Moscow telegram: The informal meeting between Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov and US Secretary of State Stimson in Geneva, although the details are not known, is predicted by the world to have major consequences in the future. Radek, President of Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, sent a letter to the Soviet Union's official newspaper Izvestia, expressing his opinion: "Regarding Japan's recent attacks against Russia, it indirectly promotes the necessity of a Russian-American alliance. If it is realized, Japan's defeat is expected. All this should be a warning to Japan. If Japan challenges again, the Soviet Union will temporarily have to seek alliances among the capitalist powers. Currently, anti-Japanese sentiment is very high throughout the United States. At this important time, Japan is taking actions that invite resentment from major powers outside the zone of conflict, truly showing a lack of understanding of the world situation, almost like a crazy thug. Therefore, in this crisis, the only way to save Japan is to cooperate with its Asian neighbors in a friendly manner to resist it."</p>
<h3>Fate of the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Japanese Army in North Manchuria Increasingly Unreliable</p>
<p>Jilin Army to Reorganize Puppet Jilin Army</p>
<p>North China Daily News, Harbin Correspondence on the 9th: The roads in North Manchuria are rugged and difficult to transport troops, so the Japanese infantry sent to the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the lower reaches of the Songhua River are of little use. The old Jilin Army is familiar with the geography, so they have various advantages in resisting the Japanese army. It is only natural that the Japanese army has suffered great setbacks recently. Furthermore, whether Ma Zhanshan is sincerely loyal to the so-called new Manchuria is still in doubt. Last week, Ma and several officers suddenly went to Qiqihar, and the Japanese military authorities were very concerned, fearing that Ma had gone there to plot a revolt. It has also been confirmed that Ding Chao often communicates with Beiping by radio. Ding may still be in contact with Ma Zhanshan. It is widely rumored that the Chinese army in North Manchuria is currently preparing to attack the Japanese army again. If this news is true, the Japanese army will have to completely change its strategy. The new Jilin Army suffered a crushing defeat when it came to Harbin, and suffered heavy losses in various other places, so the army is not reliable. The Japanese army also knows that it is useless. This morning, it was reported that the Japanese authorities intend to recall all the troops sent to the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway and station them near Harbin or Changchun. If this is the case, they will abandon the eastern end of the railway, and the old Jilin Army will not have difficulty reorganizing the new Jilin Army. In fact, in several places, the new Jilin Army has already responded to the old Jilin Army, so the situation is becoming increasingly serious. The Japanese army commander stationed in Harbin suddenly flew to Shenyang the other day, and the Japanese army commander in Qiqihar also followed. This proves that Honjo will hold a special military conference to discuss countermeasures. The current situation is completely contrary to what the Japanese army initially expected. In recent days, Japan has transported many aircraft by railway. The Japanese army clearly believes that in the war in North Manchuria, the use of aircraft is far superior to that of infantry. However, they do not know that after the spring warms up, the Manchurian forests become lush with greenery, making it difficult for aircraft to spot enemy troops from above. Instead, the Chinese army can take advantage of the dense shade to secretly hide anti-aircraft guns to bombard enemy aircraft, preventing enemy aircraft from finding targets to drop bombs. According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese large aircraft "Patriotic No. 5" was destroyed for this reason. The aircraft flew to the lower reaches of the Songhua River and headed towards the Amur River, but suddenly disappeared. It has been ten days, and there is no news. It is said that the pilot of the aircraft must have mistaken the Amur River for the Songhua River, causing it to land in Russian territory and be detained by the Russians. The Soviet military authorities never leak information about their actions. If the aircraft did cross the border, it will be difficult to find out the truth from the Russian side. The Chinese Eastern Railway's refusal to transport troops, the rugged roads, and the lush forests have greatly changed the situation in North Manchuria, and all are unfavorable to the Japanese army. It is expected that major events will occur one after another in April and May. The fate of the so-called new Manchuria is likely to be greatly affected.</p>
<h3>Luoyang Enlarged Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Dai Chuanxian's Report</p>
<p>Japan's Demise Can Be Expected</p>
<p>Luoyang News, 18th, 9:00 AM: The Central Party Headquarters and various organs of the National Government held an enlarged memorial week in the Central Auditorium of the West Palace. Those present included Dai Chuanxian, Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Shi Qingyang, Hong Ludong, Huang Jichen, as well as officers of the Central Party Headquarters and various organs of the National Government, and officers of the military. Ye Chucang presided, and Dai Chuanxian delivered a report, roughly stating that since the September 18th Incident last year, Japan, relying on violence, has been advancing from north to south, its actions becoming increasingly ferocious and its scope expanding daily. The organization jointly established and trusted by the 1.5 to 1.6 billion people of the world, which is meant to uphold justice and law, has not shown any determination to take decisive measures against this Japan, which defies reason and law and disregards good faith, in the past twenty weeks. This has led to the strong bullying with their military force, behaving arbitrarily and violently, while the weak have exhausted their capacity for endurance, but cannot obtain the assistance of justice and law. Now, in order to preserve the order of the capital and avoid being coerced by violence, the Central Government has chosen Luoyang as the temporary capital. Luoyang is the birthplace of Chinese culture and the place where China's unified state was established. Now, opening the government in the old capital during national difficulties, seeing the mountains, rivers, and people of the ancient country again, truly evokes feelings of the past and present that are overwhelming. Recalling the late Premier's instruction to restore our inherent moral intelligence in order to save the Chinese nation from its roots, and to create true freedom and equality, we must catch up with world culture head-on. We should seize this opportunity to encourage and assist our compatriots in the north who are suffering hardships, and fight together to establish a unified Chinese nation. Japan's oppression of China with violence has been going on for a long time, not just since today. However, what has been manifested this time is the most brutal scene in history. If we try to predict the outcome, from a general personal perspective, if the relationship between people and the coexistence of countries depends solely on the strength of the blade to subdue others, then Japan should succeed. But if justice and law are truly important, and we should live in harmony, cooperate, respect, and help each other, and not rely on violence to insult others, then Japan may be able to be happy for a while in a month or two, a year or two, or even a longer period, but it will inevitably fail. It can be said that today's victory is sowing the seeds of its own demise. The late Premier once told us that the progress of material science is changing daily, while the progress of political philosophy is only a little in a hundred years. The world program and international program advocated by the late modern Woodrow Wilson all emphasize faith, mutual respect, and harmony. If we compare this with our country's inherent teachings, continuing the interrupted lineages, governing the country and bringing order to chaos, maintaining the endangered court with timely visits, generous giving, and modest receiving, we should still feel ashamed of their high moral standards. Today, Japan is destroying the already flourishing, has not abandoned the interrupted, has governed the already chaotic, and has not endangered the dying, taking from others to enrich itself, has not been heard to advocate peace, and has even destroyed the existing peace treaties. How can it expect to survive in the future? Japan shamelessly steals opportunities in the international arena, taking advantage of others' lack of preparation to intimidate them, deeply offending public anger. Domestically, it is engaging in excessive military spending, and its demise can be foreseen. However, Heaven helps those who help themselves. Japan's inevitable defeat has become a certainty, but the timing of it is unknown. If China knows to work hard, save itself, and establish itself, then Japan's defeat will be the opportunity for China's rise. If we do not act in time, and only run around and cry for help when the enemy arrives, and then sleep soundly and indulge in pleasure after the enemy leaves, fearing that even sleep will not be possible and life will be lost. If China does not think about restoring its inherent moral intelligence, saving the Chinese nation from its roots, and catching up with world culture head-on to create true freedom and equality, then China's future is still worrying. From now on, we only hope that the masses will be of one mind, united as a whole, more patient internally, strive to turn big problems into small problems, and small problems into no problems in terms of personnel opinions, and create something from nothing, and turn small things into big things in construction projects, save the country and save the people. Now is the time. May we work together on this. Commercial News</p>
<h3>Gold Price Continued to Decline Slightly</h3>
<p>The process was tortuous. Yesterday, the situation of the gold price was complex and unpredictable. It was weak in the morning but then strengthened. There was a difference of eight taels. Although the silver market fell, the exchange rate rose. However, the foreign exchange rates for British and American currencies were different, and the opinions of the industry were erratic. It once broke through 720 taels, but the market situation was weak, and the exchange rate also loosened. However, the transactions on the table were very scattered. Later, it suddenly reached more than 715 taels, and finally fell back more than three taels. The overall market record is as follows:</p>
<p>Current Progress: The opening price in the morning for June fell by 2.2 qian to 717 taels. The big discount narrowed by 5/16, and the American discount only decreased by 1/4. Private telegrams also decreased by 3/16, and there were reports that there was not much activity in the United States. Therefore, people seemed pessimistic. Yuhe, Hengchang, Yongwu, and others first bought in, and the price rose to 19 taels. They sold with Taichang, Dadecheng, Hongkang, Yongyi, and others, but the price could not be sustained and fell by more than 3 taels. At 9:15, it was 15 taels and 7 qian. In addition, British gold could be settled at 8125 forward and 875 for hedging. At 9:30, the first order was placed at 125. The American currency was also the same, and it was added to 17.5 taels. However, the internal situation was loose. China Merchants Bank hedged July American currency at 625. Yuanmao, Yongheng, and others, as well as Taichang and Dadecheng, were constantly selling. The price fell to 15 taels in an instant. Then, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Bingxing, Daxing, Yongwu, Mou Qianchang, Xiangshunli, and others all entered. Taichang also turned around and bought, especially hedging July British currency at 8125, June 75, and this month's American currency at 1875. In just half an hour, it surged by more than 7 taels to 22.5 taels at 10:00. Afterwards, Bingxing, Yifeng, Hengyu, Hongkang, Yongzhifengyong, and others came to sell, and there was a profit in selling May American currency at 3125 and this month at 25. Therefore, the gold price went back by 4 taels. However, from 10:15 to 10:45, there was an interval of one or two taels. Then, it was 18 taels and 6 qian. Hua Bi bought July British currency at 8125, and Mai Xing absorbed June 75. Hua Bi Zhengjin hedged June American currency at 25. Moreover, Dadecheng, Yuhe, Qianchangxiang, Xie Xingyong bought more, and in 20 minutes, it rose by more than 4 taels, to 23 taels and 2 qian at 11:00. However, Yuanmao, Yong Bingxing, Yifeng, Yifengyong, and others were also unyielding in their intention to sell, and there were rumors that the situation between Japan and Russia was tense. People were frightened, and it fell by 5 taels, to 18 taels and 3 qian at 11:45. When the market closed, it was 18 taels and 8 qian. The quoted price was changed to 777 taels, a difference of 60 taels to 54 taels, and 58 taels at noon.</p>
<p>Afternoon Relaxation: The market opened in the afternoon at 18 taels and 1 qian, then 17 taels and 3 qian, and then 18 taels and 2 qian. However, there were very few transactions. Afterwards, Xie Xingyong, Daxingyong, and others sold, and the price was suppressed by more than 1 tael by hedging July American currency at 4375. At 2:30, it was 16 taels and 6 qian. Since then, there has been no major change, but only a fluctuation of one or two taels. However, Yuanmao Yongda and other retail investors came in, causing the price to rise. After 3:00, HSBC absorbed 8125 shillings, and the market situation improved again, adding to more than 18 taels. Yifeng and Wanxing also entered, and around 4:00, it was reported that the Indian exchange rate had decreased by 11 annas, and it suddenly rose by 2 taels. At 4:15, it was 19 taels and 4 qian. Suddenly, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Yuanmao Yong, and others came to sell, and the price turned down. In just over ten minutes, it fell sharply by about 4 taels, and suddenly it was 15 taels and a half. Then, at 4:30, it closed at 15 taels and 7 qian, a decrease of 3 taels and 5 qian compared to the previous day, and then it was traded at around 17 taels. The maximum price during the day was 23 taels and 2 qian, and the minimum was 15, a difference of 8 taels and 2 qian. The quoted price was a difference of 60 taels, registered 23 taels to 19, and water top-up of 23 to 20 taels, resulting in six taels red bar in total.</p>
<p>Scattered Entrance and Exit: Statistics on transactions on the table show that Daxingyong, Shunli, Bingxing, Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Yuhe, and Wu Mou all entered. Dadecheng sold more and bought less. Yuantai and Yuanmao Yong had mixed entrances and exits. Hongkangyong, Tong Taichang, Xie Xingyong, Hengyu, and Futaiheng all sold. In the afternoon, each shop had only a small number of receipts and payments, so the market situation was only about three taels.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Fluctuated from Time to Time</h3>
<p>The listed price has been reduced by half a grade.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American exchange rates continued to rise, leading to a stable British currency and a weaker American currency in Shanghai. However, the HSBC listed price fell, so it was also reduced by half a grade. British gold was 125, which was 1 shilling, 7 pence, and 625. American currency was also reduced by 125, which was 30 yuan and 875. The Hong Kong rate did not change and was still 76 taels. Other exchange rates were reduced across the board.</p>
<p>Internal Bank Prices: The exchange rate fluctuated throughout the day. British gold was initially strong and then flat, with about 70,000 to 80,000 pounds traded. The gold industry had unequal receipts and payments. Most banks hedged. American currency was initially weak and then strong, and then loosened in the afternoon, with a total of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan traded. Each company settled slightly. The Dalian group first advanced and then exited, with some hedging, and there were quite a few interbank receipts and payments. As a result, compared with the day before, the British gold rate was roughly the same, and the American currency rate increased by 125. It is said that the gold price fell slightly, but the market situation was almost a circular pattern.</p>
<p>The British exchange rate's internal disc difference was only 0625 at both morning and afternoon markets, the swap rate was closed flat.

<h3>Hard to Expect Progress in Lixi Market</h3>
<p>Copper Coins See New High Prices Again</p>
<p>Since the collapse of the Lixi market before last week, it has stabilized slightly in the past few days, and seems to have been peaceful yesterday and the days before. However, the sales are not smooth, and there is no progress. As a result, the Lixi price is still as soft as ever. Yesterday, the morning Lixi price was 7 qian 0 li 2 hao 8 hu 7 ban, and the afternoon Lixi price was 7 qian 0 li 2 hao 7 ban, only a difference of 1 hao 2 hu and a half compared to the afternoon of the previous day. The silver discount was still 1 qian, the same price in the morning and afternoon. The bank listed price was 4 fen, and the head markup plus water was 1 qian 12 fen, slightly higher than the previous day. The number of discount tickets traded was 1.3 million, making remittance and draft payments. In the morning, it was 475,000, and in the afternoon, it was 675,000. Banknotes were 50,000 in the morning and afternoon. Bank transactions were 1 million in the morning and afternoon. The banks' silver receipts and payments included more than 2.9 million in various receipts and payments by Chinese merchants, more than 300,000 in remittance receipts and payments, more than 400,000 in customs duty receipts, more than 500,000 in goods receipts and payments, more than 700,000 in foreign receipts and payments, more than 3.3 million in various receipts and payments by foreign merchants, more than 400,000 in mortgage receipts, more than 700,000 in goods receipts and payments, more than 300,000 in special receipts, and more than 500,000 in remittance receipts and payments.

Copper coins rose again by 1,000 wen to 418,000, creating a new record that has never been seen before.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Markets Become More Bullish</h3>
<p>Troop Reduction Strengthens… Resumption of Business Is Brewing</p>
<p>In the past two days, there have still been off-market transactions settled within the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange. The day before yesterday, there were only 20 rolls, with 5,000 yuan each for salt tax. Yesterday, it reached 125,000 yuan, including 75,000 yuan for 20 rolls, 30,000 for salt tax, and 20,000 for 20 customs. As a result, the remaining transactions have been reduced to more than 4.7 million yuan. As for the trend of bond prices, due to the scarcity of sales on the market and the lack of demand, it continues to rise. Among them, troop reduction has reached 44 yuan, an increase of more than 2 yuan compared to last week. Others have continued to increase by 4-5 jiao to more than 1 yuan. Only the six whole customs, customs tax, and 96 customs, etc., have extremely rare inflows and outflows, and the price has little change. According to news from the market, brokers in the securities exchange are quite willing to open the market as soon as possible. However, considering the current bond market situation, it is feared that it will not be easy to realize until the Sino-Japanese issue has a proper solution. It is also heard that the total daily turnover of bond futures settlement and spot transactions is about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Stagnant, Financial Tightness, Yarn Prices Lower</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still weak, and the downward trend is still intense. Because the stock of each factory is gradually increasing, and the sales are sluggish, the finance is extremely tight, and all parties lack vitality, which makes people feel more worried. The market price has turned sharply downwards, and there is a tendency to get worse. As for the situation in all directions, it is extremely difficult, and there is no hope of brisk sales. Therefore, in reality, it is inevitable that there will be a big drop in the future. It is heard that most of the Japanese factories have resumed operations and started their machines, and there are many competitors for Chinese yarn. Statistics show that 500 bales were bought by various merchants throughout the day. 115 bales were entered by peers, and the market dropped by 5 qian to 1 tael and 2 qian and a half. The price of 16-count golden rooster yarn has entered the customs within 60 taels. Shantou entered 50 bales, Tianjin 65 bales, Sichuan 80 bales, Ningbo 30 bales, Northern merchant 75 bales, inland 45 bales, Jiangxi 5 bales, and Shenxin factory slightly issued some oddments.</p>
<h3>Shenxin's Cotton Absorption Is Already Saturated</h3>
<p>Cotton spot sales are relatively clear, and the intentions of each factory are more relaxed, because the situation of foreign cotton is trending down, and the situation is weak, and there is a trend of finding new low prices. Therefore, the actions of each factory are stagnant again. Although the new factories have intentions, they have absorbed a lot recently, and there is a worry that it is already saturated.</p>
<h3>American and British Cotton Fall Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to a lack of important buyers, better weather, and a weak Wall Street. Futures fell by 7 to 9 pounds of sound, and spot fell by 5 pounds of sound. British cotton futures fell by 9 to 10 points, and spot fell by 10 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 15 points. Indian cotton bulls closed out, and the market was weak. Pingguoer fell by 6.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 8 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (18th telegram).</p>
<p>US Cotton Compared to Previous Day Shanghai Standard  British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Shanghai Standard</p>

<h3>Food Grain, North and South Rice Markets Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the South head’s source of goods was still abundant, with about forty stores present. Wholesale sales on the main street were slow. Wuxi and Su-Tong buying groups' appetite for rice was faint due to the abundant supply. Opening prices were each reduced by 2 corners. The early and late harvests' circumstances were weak, also dropping by about a corner’s allowance. Foreign Du-Jian selling venues suddenly turned to slackness. Zhongguan also fell short by one ruler. Although the change in cloudy yuan rice was said to arrive in droves, no sales activities were seen. No honor or disgrace in the market. North head sources were around thirty stores yesterday, transactions weren’t good. The special northern group’s goods still remained outside 15 yuan’s customs. Zhongguan goods were each reduced by two or three corners, circumstances were hard to predict. Southern group’s early harvest Flying Phoenix rice was selling as fast as it arrived, prices were one ruler low. Port and foreign Jian still had some buyers to transport. Market trends stabilized. The glutinous rice wine drinkers' appetite was faint, and circumstances were in a downstream trend.</p>
<h3>Continuing to Settle Ocean Rice Futures</h3>
<p>The condition of the ocean rice market yesterday was temporarily stable. Because of the high market price in producing areas, commodity owners were unwilling to cheaply let go. Only the main street vendors had an appetite, without a large batch of inland or merchant groups' sales. So the market revealed holding-up behavior. But ocean liners had ceased to continually throw in futures. Merchants who had sold now all had intentions to recoup, so the market price of futures remained on a rising tide. Overall market prices showed Saigon No. 1 spot rice at 1000 bags, priced at 11 yuan 3 corners to 11 yuan 2 and a half corners, and small twist rice at more than 2000 bags, priced at 10 yuan 1 and a half corners to 9 yuan 9 corners. The futures settled was five months forward No. 1 Saigon at 500 tons, priced at 5 taels 3 qian and a half, 4 months forward Min Dang at 500 tons, priced at 4 taels 9 qian and a half, small twist 5 months forward at 200 tons, priced at 5 taels 08 fen to 5 taels 05 fen.</p>
<h3>Spot Flour Appears Weary Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot flour market again showed weary signs. Common buying patrons with no real strength, due to receiving the goods, if not settle, then their paid deposit will be written off. Thus the matter was to scramble to sell, not regard the market condition, thus April's opening price was a fraction lower from the previous month at only 2 taels 1 qian 05 li, then from the sellers still smooth the price was continued small 2 and a half li. Due to the buyer's morale still good 5 month's open price was at 2 taels 1 qian 2 fen and a half, buyers' consideration remained fixed, and the manufacturer's stance was also firm, and thus the closing price went reverse to 2 and a half li. The recent army vessel transport road slightly loosened, so the red and blue vehicles were sold on the main street, with price equal to the military vessel. As the fort's commodities were too many and sales were quiet, with only open at 2 taels 056 fen, all else was the same.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods the Piece Market Were All in a Downward Direction</h3>
<p>Factory Market</p>
<p>Lately the markets increasingly revealed weary quiet, blue stripe bleached cloth was small one money around, Yihua and Wufu was 8 taels and a half, Booksheng graph was 8 taels 2 money and a half, blue stripe twill also fell the Gold 8 wealth 5 taels 8, Dade profit was 5 taels and a half. fine cloth's drop was even more intense, especially Hubei’s Running Horse was the softest, was sold yesterday at 8 taels 4, Wannianqing was 8 taels 7 money and a half, really due to the buyers demand from the north was dull, the Shanghai stock filled. Yesterday, Tianjing, Qinhuangdao, and other places in the north helped buy one hundred and fifty pieces of 16-pound coarse cloth: Shuang Yu Jiqing seven taels nine, Samsung nine money two and a half points, Hongfu seven taels nine. Fine twill was the hardest with Jincheng, sold at seven taels eight money and a half. Yesterday, Shantou helped complete the transaction of fifty pieces, Yihua bleach cloth also dropped, Jin Santa was eight taels nine, Cloud Outer Fragrance wasn't in stock.</p>
<p>West Piece Market still lacked good signs. Local buyers only had few transactions, yesterday there were still some sales to let go, Taikwo Red Chicken • Red Peace • Red Small Deer • were still thirteen taels, Sassoon's nine to the most expensive was twelve taels. Lun Chang bleached cloth was in strong demand on the main street, and Tianguan was nine taels three money and a half. Striped pongee still wasn’t vigorous. Beyond that, all on the market were full thread commodities more popular than the rest, full thread and one thread one thread commodities consistently weren't vigorous. White Chong striped ramie was still sold at 2 money yuan. Feather silk due to the season was now lost, business was getting quiet day by day, prices were fairly calm, Tianfu Tianguan bestowed blessing thirteen taels, Gongping Heaven Gave gold thirteen taels and a half, SanYou drawing thirteen taels.</p>
<h3>Silks and Teas Xiaoshan spring silkworms newly going warm for kinds</h3>
<p>Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, used to be a famous area for cocoon production, but due to unfavorable silkworm business in the past year, and because of economic hardships after the war this year, there are few people raising silkworms. Farmers in Kanshan, Shushan, Toupeng, Shanxinan, Nanyangdian, Jingjiangdian, Cangqian, Wenyan and other places are only starting to warm their seeds, and the number of hatched eggs has been greatly reduced, with statistics showing only 30% of previous years.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil After the Market Opening</h3>
<p>The tung oil market is mainly concentrated in Hankou, so foreign firms tend to purchase there. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the financial situation in various places has been greatly affected. Hankou is the place where all kinds of goods in our country gather, controlling the north and south. When the situation changes slightly, the financial situation will be the first to bear the brunt. Although tung oil has overseas sales channels, which is slightly different from other goods, it is still difficult to avoid difficulties. Therefore, before the Shanghai war, the sales of foreign firms were still outside 21 taels. Later, due to the war in Shanghai, the market was closed, and the transactions of foreign firms in Hankou were intermittent, and the price gradually fell downstream. Until recently, it has fallen to 18 taels, and the trend is still sluggish. Moreover, in the past two or three years, the transactions of foreign firms have only been in small quantities of dozens of tons or nearly 100 tons, unlike the large transactions of three or five hundred tons or thousands of tons in the past. The decline in its foreign trade can be seen from this. In recent days, the news from Hankou is that the foreign firms' price is 18 taels as the regular price, and the wholesale price for domestic sales is around 15 taels. Shanghai has been closed for two months, and the accounts for the 20th year have not yet been closed. Although the market is now open with great pain, the actual business is still suspended, and cash transactions are required, which is no longer comparable to the past. Therefore, although the market is nominally open, it is no different from being closed. Local firms are still giving up on imports due to the inability to develop sales channels, and must wait for the situation to be completely calm and the financial situation to be circulating before there is room for development.</p>

<h3>Encouraging Black Horses</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>I once used black horses as a sign against red sheep, in order to praise General Ma Zhanshan. The General guarded the soil and fought the Japanese with an isolated army in the remote borders, killing and wounding more than necessary. Loyalty and courage are unparalleled. Therefore, the reputation of hero resounded at home and abroad, which was earlier than the two generals, Cai Tingkai and Jiang Guangnai. This is called the first merit and the most commendable. I didn't expect that there was a period of humiliation in the middle of accommodating the enemy. The people of the country suspected it and thought it was softening. Now there are two good articles and telegrams, and the matter is clear. I believe this statement. Why should Zhuang Miao return to Cao, but his heart was to revitalize the Han Dynasty. Zifang assisted Pei, his ambition was to preserve Korea. In the past, Yi Yin went to Jie five times and to Tang five times. Mencius called him a saint who was responsible for his mission, because he took the world as his responsibility and helped Tang to complete the revolution. Observing the world and knowing people, and comprehensively observing words and deeds, the General's heart is set on the Republic of China, and it will never change. Then, he is also a hero and almost a sage. Today, the torrent is in the sea, and the world has a chance to undergo a drastic change. The great mountains and rivers, the Chinese nation cannot die. There is a gentleman who can rule the country. Only adversity can prosper the country. Like the General, the bright moon and floating clouds do not hinder the impurities of Taiqing. Only in times of turbulence can we know the loyalty of a strong grass in a strong wind. Although I am not literary, I will write a biography of the Black Horse and attach it to the history books to promote my yellow people. General, please work hard!</p>
<h3>Patriotic Child</h3>
<p>— Remembering Autumn, sent from Wuzhong</p>
<p>A few days ago, I passed the Qian Wan Li Bridge. I saw a crowd of people next to the bridge, and the sound of voices was boiling. Driven by curiosity, I stepped forward to investigate. I saw a middle-aged woman holding a child by the hand, repeatedly calling, "You're foolish! You're foolish!" The child struggled desperately, facing the train station, repeatedly shouting, "I want to go to Kunshan!" The voice was extremely tragic, and tears flowed down his face. The onlookers were all moved. I inquired further and learned that they were mother and son. The child's name was Shen Qi, eleven years old, studying at the Experimental Elementary School. He usually excelled in both character and academics. Recently, he has been reading newspapers every day and knows that the Japanese are becoming increasingly tyrannical and that the national territory is being shaken daily. Therefore, this small heart was stirred by a patriotic upsurge, forgetting his own age, and he swore to kill the enemy and save the country. Previously, there were two classmates, both of the same age, who agreed the day before to go to the train station, wanting to take a train to Kunshan to join the army and kill the enemy. Unexpectedly, the train did not arrive, and both were forced back by their families. However, although Shen Qi was young, his determination was quite firm. The next morning, he did not meet his two friends again, but left home alone, intending to walk along the railway to Kunshan. Unexpectedly, he had not reached the station before he was stopped by his family. Because his ambition could not be fulfilled twice, he was in so much pain that he wanted to die. His mother tightly held his hand, refusing to let go. The mother and son were thus in a stalemate on the road. At this time, I had other important matters to attend to and did not know what happened afterwards. Alas, the national crisis is deep. Even a child is so indignant, I wonder what those high-ranking officials think and feel when they see this?</p>
<h3>Four Days of Work</h3>
<p>— Zhong Huan</p>
<p>Commander-in-chief Liang Guanying of Hai Tai was notified that after the 19th Army, which was fighting bravely against the Japanese, retreated to the second line of defense, he heard that the Japanese bandits intended to occupy Jingjiang as a base for attacking the Jiangyin Fortress. Commander-in-chief Liang, upon hearing this news, immediately prepared for defense along the Yangtze River. Suffering from inconvenient transportation, he issued an order: "Complete the Tongjing Avenue (from Nantong, passing through Rugao, to Jingjiang) within four days."</p>
<p>Therefore, the public security bureaus of various districts and the heads and deputies of various townships summoned the people along the way, explained the cruelty of the Japanese invasion, and asked them to work day and night. Sure enough, within one hundred hours, they built dozens of bridges and a wide eighteen-foot-wide, several hundred-li-long avenue. Recently, those lightning-fast cars have been patrolling back and forth. Regarding defense, there is naturally nothing to worry about. Commander-in-chief Liang's rapid deployment is indeed commendable. And the spirit of the road-building people, who worked tirelessly for one hundred hours, is especially admirable. The ceasefire talks have now stalled. What is being reported to the League of Nations for resolution is all unreliable. If those in power also issued an order like Commander-in-chief Liang's: "Expel the Japanese pirates from the country within four days," I think the soldiers who are usually supported by the people would certainly not stand idly by or abandon their weapons and flee.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Battle and Armaments (14)</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>Aircraft Since the end of the seventeenth century, the Portuguese Qu Shimou and the Italian La Nuo created hot air balloons. The Frenchman Shi Wen performed in the air for twenty-two minutes. All countries were extremely shocked and devoted their full efforts to the aviation industry. In 1908, the German Count Xu Berlin invented a large airship. Thus, the aviation world took on a new look. Before long, the Austrian Kai Tu, the Italian Na Ni, the English Maxwell, the American Wick Zhe Meng, and the French Faber Fameng Fu Kuole also invented new aircraft one after another. By then, the aviation industry in Europe and the United States had achieved great success. Afterwards, academic studies developed, and machinery advanced. The military considered it the only sharp weapon. With the outbreak of the European War, the German Xu Berlin aircraft coerced the Allied forces, and London and Paris were repeatedly attacked. Although the French Fartman-style aircraft, the Italian Caproli-style aircraft, and the British Handly</p>
<p>Bage-style aircraft each had their own characteristics, they ultimately could not defeat the German Gotba-style aircraft. Therefore, after six years of war, they suffered greatly from German aircraft. After the war, the aviation issue was given particular attention by various countries. Such as the progress of engines, the reduction of air resistance, the transformation of biplanes into monoplanes, the improvement of various mechanical materials, as well as the equipment of wireless telegraphs, bombs, parachutes, and observation devices, cameras, etc., are becoming more and more perfect every day. The most significant one seems to be the recent performance of the French aviator Bo Si Deluo in the Alscheli area of Africa, where he performed a stationary circling flight, reaching seventy-six hours and forty-three minutes. The straight-line distance was approximately sixteen thousand kilometers, breaking the new record in the aviation world. If another American Peran Kang monoplane, which also used a De Sher engine when crossing the Pacific Ocean last year, can maintain a long-distance flight of eighty-four hours. It is said that if another aircraft is used to connect and supply gasoline, it can fly in the air for twenty-three days. At the beginning of this month, the Russian technician Ge Luofu Sike newly built an airship with a speed of three hundred and seventy-five kilometers per hour, with two engines installed in the front and rear. From this point of view, the progress of aviation is truly incredible.</p>
<h3>National Hatred and Family Hatred (1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Tianhen</p>
<p>Originally, this night! The night of January 28th! Could have been a night to sleep soundly! The situation a few days ago had been very tense. Many neighbors had moved to avoid danger. Zheng Hua, for the sake of his seventy-year-old mother and eleven-year-old son, Xiong, had also considered moving. However, on the 28th, the municipal government completely succumbed to the four conditions put forward by the Japanese, and the tense situation eased down. Furthermore, the newspaper even published that the Japanese Consul-General had expressed satisfaction, which was even more evidence of the easing. Although Zheng Hua was resentful, the fact that Shanghai could be spared from war, for the sake of his old mother and young son, made him feel and understand the Shanghai mayor's compromise, and he realized that it was truly a necessary compromise! He turned his head and saw the old and frail state of his mother. At the same time, Xiong'er jumped in from outside, shouted "Papa," and immediately ran to his grandmother's side, took her hand, and called "Grandma." The old grandmother smiled with her old eyes, staring at Xiong'er's face, and suddenly he felt a current of love, which dispelled a chest full of anger.</p>
<p>"Tonight, I can sleep soundly!" The old mother and young son slept together. He himself slept alone in the attic. When he entered the bedroom at ten o'clock, he still thought so. His wife had died of illness eight years ago, and Xiong'er had grown up relying on his grandmother's care, so Xiong'er had always slept with his grandmother.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he heard an extraordinary noise outside. He was just about to fall asleep, but he was awakened by this noise. He never expected that on the very night that the Japanese Consul-General expressed satisfaction, something would change. But after listening again, it was completely wrong. He was very perceptive. He quickly put on his clothes and walked out of the house. The alley was in a state of emergency. The chaos of people fleeing in a hurry, and the crackling sounds from outside the alley, clearly told him that war had broken out! He immediately ran out of the alley again to find out what was going on.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it was pitch black outside the alley. He could only see the flashes of light accompanying the crackling sounds. Otherwise, he could see nothing. He also panicked at once. As he moved forward, he soon saw figures. At the same time, there were many "whooshing" sounds whizzing past his ears. He immediately realized that these were bullets. He was greatly alarmed and quickly lay down on the ground, crawling forward. The figures he had seen earlier came to stop him, and he realized that they were Chinese soldiers. The sound of guns and cannons suddenly became denser, and looking around in the darkness, the wriggling figures seemed to be many. The sound of guns and cannons was dense, and the noisy voices of people were even noisier, mixed with crying. Although he was stern, he was scared into a cold sweat. Clearly, he could not go forward, so he changed direction and crawled home. Unexpectedly, he had not reached the entrance of the alley before he was blocked by a large crowd of people. Suddenly, he heard a grinding sound overhead. Then, with a deafening roar, the entrance to his alley was blown up, along with several houses. He had originally wanted to go home to take his mother and young son to escape, but at that moment, his soul was almost blown out of his body, and his mind became numb. Regardless of anything else, he just crawled away for his life.</p>

<p>Opinion</p>
<h3>Dismiss and Punish Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>— Da</p>
<p>It is said that the National Crisis Conference unanimously passed a resolution!! "Dismiss and punish Zhang Xueliang." Of course, this is a big cannon worth our attention. But whether this cannon can actually fire is even more worth our attention. In China, killing an ordinary person is easier than blowing off dust. But figures with knives, guns, and the "Shuai" (Marshal) or "Zhang" (Commander) titles of "heroic generals" will never willingly and easily let you pull out a single hair. Although Zhang Xueliang did not resist the Japanese and lost his old home overnight, under the policy of "preserving strength," he still has many nominally impressive troops that he can command. May I ask, what strength have the gentlemen of the National Crisis Conference prepared to confront Zhang Xueliang's "strength"?</p>
<p>Indeed, when counting the "strengths" to deal with a Zhang Xueliang within the country, there are still many, and those who harbor the psychology of "he can be replaced" and wait for the opportunity to act are also quite numerous. If that is the case, wouldn't it be another scene of "strength" and "strength" fighting each other for territory, and the result would still be the death of us common people?</p>
<p>Therefore, no one does not applaud the National Crisis Conference's passage of the resolution to dismiss and punish Zhang Xueliang. But may I ask what the result will be? After all, it is just another cannon firing blanks. Although the sound is loud, it cannot defeat people. "Officials protect each other" is originally a well-experienced maxim in our country. Moreover, the National Crisis Conference is originally a temporary deliberative body and has no authority to force the government to implement anything. Therefore, whether to dismiss and punish or not is still "the government's own discretion, and the members need not be verbose."</p>
<p>If it is said that the words "dismiss and punish" are originally only applicable to those without status or guns. If one has status and also guns, according to history, corruption and lawlessness are commonplace, and no one dares to say a word. Originally, they are not worthy of being "dismissed and punished". I think these gentlemen of the National Crisis Conference are not unaware of the truth. However, they are just putting forward such a pleasant-sounding proposal as a pretense.</p>

<h3>Mr. Tan Pei Discusses Vehicle Accidents in the International Settlement</h3>
<p>One Hundred and Forty Lives Lost</p>
<p>Over Nine Thousand Vehicle Accidents</p>
<p>Vehicle accidents are common in major cities in Europe and America, and there are often shocking statistics. There are currently over seven thousand vehicles in Shanghai. Vehicle accidents are also frequently heard of. Approximately five or six accident cases occur each week. Although the municipal authorities use various methods to avoid unfortunate incidents, last year in the Shanghai International Settlement, a total of one hundred and forty people lost their lives due to vehicle accidents. Four thousand and three hundred people were injured. The number cannot be said to be small. The following is a translation of statistics published in Western newspapers. In 1931, vehicle accidents in the Shanghai International Settlement reached a peak in October. The police department handled one thousand two hundred and seventy-nine cases. Among them, twenty people were injured and died. This number is actually the highest record in a single month in the history of the police department. By the end of December 1931, the total number of vehicle accidents in the year was twelve thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven, which was an increase compared to the previous year. However, the number of deaths was slightly lower.</p>
<p>In January, there were nine hundred and fifty accident cases, in which two hundred and sixty-two people were injured and eight people lost their lives.

<h3>Mr. Ze Discusses the Vehicle Situation in the City This Spring</h3>
<p>This spring, the vehicle situation in Shanghai is similar to the same period last year in the French Concession. In the International Settlement, the changes are greater, resulting in a difference from expectations. The biggest reason is that the Japanese army occupied the Hongkou area, causing the duties of the four police stations of Hongkou, Wayside, Dixwell Road, and East Jiaxing Road to stagnate. However, the increase in all barbed wire, sandbags, and armed sentries reduced the frequent accidents at intersections. However, the serious damage caused by collisions of Japanese military vehicles is not small. The reason for this unfortunate incident is mostly due to the Japanese military vehicles driving too fast and not being familiar with the traffic on the left side of the city.</p>
<p>In February, the concessions imposed a curfew after 10:00 PM. In March, the curfew time was extended to 11:30 PM. As a result, the vehicle accidents that usually occur at midnight have been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Last spring, the total number of traffic accidents was two thousand seven hundred and seventy-two, the most of any quarter last year. The number of vehicles involved in accidents was two thousand two hundred and seventy-three, with a total of thirty-one deaths and eight hundred and thirty-four injuries. However, five hundred and sixty-three people were injured by automobiles.</p>
<p>In February of this year, five hundred and fifty-one traffic accidents were reported, with fourteen deaths and one hundred and ninety-one injuries. In the same month last year, there were eight hundred and fifty-three cases, with six deaths and three hundred and forty injuries.</p>
<p>Last month, i.e., in March, there were eight hundred vehicle incidents, of which seven hundred were automobiles. The number of accidents caused by trams and public buses has been particularly reduced. February has a shorter duration, with fourteen deaths, while March has a longer duration, but only ten people died. There were two hundred and sixty-eight injuries.</p>
<p>In total, there were two thousand four hundred vehicle incidents this spring in ninety-one days, with thirty-four deaths, three more deaths than last year. There were seven hundred and seventy-five injuries.</p>
<p>The number of automobile sales this spring has decreased significantly. However, optimists say that business can gradually recover after the summer begins. The International Settlement reported at the end of last year that a total of eight thousand nine hundred and three vehicles of various types were registered. As of March 31st of this year, the number of registrations is still similar, including six thousand one hundred and sixty-two automobiles, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven transport vehicles, and eight hundred and four motorcycles.</p>
<p>Approximately six hundred vehicles of various types brought by the Japanese army have been licensed by the Public Works Department. Therefore, the roads in the city have suddenly become crowded, which is rare since 1920. Ford is the most common passenger car in the city, followed by Buick. Others in order are Morris, Chevrolet, Vauxhall, and Studebaker. Ford is also the most common freight car, followed by Stewart. The third most common is Chevrolet.</p>
<p>Statistics</p>

<h3>Mr. Fu Discusses the Cost Statistics of Morris Cars</h3>
<p>Less than one and a quarter pence per mile.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of automobiles is already well-known, and there is no need to elaborate. However, there are no accurate statistics on how much automobiles cost per mile. Therefore, people who want to purchase automobiles often doubt the excessive cost and dare not purchase them rashly. In fact, a truly good vehicle has its limits on the cost per mile. It is not as expensive as we imagine. As for the advantages of convenience, comfort, and time saving, the income from the cost is even more worthwhile. Here, we publish the cost statistics of a certain gentleman's car for reference by general car owners and those who want to buy cars.</p>
<p>The car that Mr. So-and-so purchased is a Morris Cowley Six-cylinder car. The distance traveled has exceeded 12,000 miles. Mr. So-and-so made statistics on the cost per mile in order to prove with real numbers the driving cost of Morris and the usual repair costs, etc. Even if calculated generously, it is actually less than one and a quarter pence per mile. From the day Mr. So-and-so purchased the car on July 1, 1930, to January 1, 1931, the number on the car's speedometer was 5536. On December 31, the number on the meter was 17850. In total, the mileage in 1931 was 12314 miles. The expenses are as follows...</p>
<p>Gasoline 544 gallons……£35 12s 8d……Approximately 0.70 pence per mile</p>
<p>Tires……£10 12s 3d……Approximately 0.20 pence per mile</p>
<p>Oil and grease, etc.……£5 7s 2d……Approximately 0.10 pence per mile</p>
<p>The above totals £51 12s 1d……Approximately 1 pence per mile</p>
<p>Driving repair costs……£5 2s 6d……Approximately 0.18 pence per mile</p>
<p>Total: £60 14s 7d……Total of 1.18 pence per mile</p>
<p>Miscellaneous expenses……Insurance……£15……Approximately 0.29 pence per mile</p>
<p>……Also……Insurance……£12 17s 9d……Approximately 0.25 pence per mile</p>
<p>……Also……Automobile Association membership fee……£2 2s……Approximately 0.04 pence per mile</p>
<p>The total of the above items is 1.76 pence per mile.</p>
<p>The price of gasoline used by Mr. So-and-so ranged from 1 shilling and 2 pence per gallon to 1 shilling and 4.5 pence per gallon. The results were extremely satisfactory. However, the price of gasoline was lower in 1931. Therefore, for the sake of prudence, the budget for the fuel portion of the expenses in 1932 should be slightly increased. The same is true for tires. Also, air tires will have to be replaced sooner or later. Therefore, Mr. So-and-so estimates the total cost of 12,000 miles to be a total of £95. In addition, Mr. So-and-so employs a driver. However, the cost is not convenient to include. Because the driver's wages vary from place to place, and Mr. So-and-so's driver also serves as a handyman, and the car owner drives the car himself and does not employ a driver, this is also very common. According to Mr. So-and-so, his car is a convertible sedan, which is suitable for all seasons. It is an extremely comfortable vehicle. The number of passengers, excluding the driver, ranges from one to three. Mr. So-and-so expects that the Morris Cowley Six-cylinder car will be sufficient to meet all needs within five years. As for the car's speed, it averages about 30 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Records</p>
<h3>Mr. Xu Lulin Discusses the Philosophy of Ford Industry (2)</h3>
<p>Approaching the truth, but not being able to recognize it, is the most common and most difficult to correct problem that ordinary people commit.</p>
<p>"There is nothing new except for new knowledge and new understanding."</p>
<p>New knowledge and new understanding are all the result of experience. Only the result of experience can complete a person's character. I believe that we are born into the world to accumulate experience and complete character. Even if our knowledge starts small, the total amount of real knowledge we increase every day is the total amount of indestructible truth that constructs real life.</p>
<p>There are also many words that promote experience. In short, experience is the source of all great achievements. And this kind of experience cannot be learned in any way. Only little by little understanding of it." (The above is from Chapter 2.)</p>
<p>Chapter 3: On Success</p>
<p>"The secret to success in life is to discover what you should do and then carry it out. In general, mankind sometimes cannot but bear the obligation to engage in unpleasant things. There are also times when they cannot but engage in事業 that have only sacrifice and no reward. When first engaging in such sacrificial 사업, they are often misunderstood, insulted, and regarded as fools. Therefore, everyone naturally wants to retreat. However, if you are convinced that this is something that cannot be done, then you must go full speed ahead. As for success or failure, only fate will tell. This is not necessarily pleasant, nor is it necessarily close to the people, nor is it necessarily something that the people like. However, it is exactly what fate hopes for us, and what it orders us to accomplish. If someone goes straight ahead, even if he is isolated, it is not to be feared. He is not really isolated, because behind his righteous thoughts, there are many people silently following him.</p>
<p>"Many fools often slander the reclusive gentlemen. The gentlemen seem to be alone, but in fact they are just silent. The feeling of loneliness only arises when we stand on a fork in the road, on the one hand wanting to follow the old ways of life, and on the other hand wanting to listen to the voice of人生 that is changing and obey him. It is very lonely at the moment of decision, but once he makes up his mind and the thought of fulfilling his obligation, he is no longer lonely. Once he makes up his mind, many people who share his thoughts will immediately come to support him and expect him to declare these thoughts and claims.</p>
<h3>The Double Ratio of the Auburn Automobile</h3>
<p>The so-called double ratio means that the same car has two axle ratios. With this device, whether going up or down hills, or driving on flat ground, the car's operational efficiency can be readily controlled. When using the low ratio, the car's speed is 50 miles per hour, and the engine rotates 2,700 times. If, while driving at the same speed, one suddenly switches to a higher gear, i.e., the high ratio, the engine's rotations immediately drop to 1,800 times. However, the car's speed remains at 50 miles per hour. As the number of engine rotations decreases, the consumption of gas naturally also decreases. Thus, the sharp reduction in vibration, the greater smoothness of driving, and the greater economic efficiency are all natural results. The small circle in the above picture shows the ratio lever installed on the dashboard.</p>
<p>He also understands the psychology of onlookers very clearly. He says, "Of course, there are many people who take the attitude of 'watching the wind turn the rudder.'" They do not want to take on the labor of guidance, but only hope to enjoy happiness within the possible range. Because those who take the lead in fighting for justice must endure considerable suffering, so they prefer to take the attitude of watching the wind turn the rudder, observing the struggle between truth and error, and waiting to see who wins and who loses. Even if they hold a rough belief that truth will eventually prevail, they absolutely cannot be expected to support others until the victory or defeat is decided."</p>
<p>He has a piece of advice on how to solve problems, which is very enlightening. He says, "The average person," rather than saying that he solves problems by trying, it is better to say that he spends more time and energy wandering around the problem. The problem is a challenge to your wisdom. Before the problem is solved, it remains a problem. Those who solve problems must receive a certain reward. We should change our attitude of avoiding problems to welcoming them, and use proper thinking ability to deal with them. We should give it proper consideration and pay it proper rewards. The time spent by the discerning youth lies in learning the method of directly dealing with problems. In detail, it is to harmoniously learn to use his mind and moderate activity, enabling him to use the simplest and most direct method he knows to solve the problems before him."</p>
<p>Chapter 4. Why I believe in progress. He believes that the two major obstacles to success are terror and arrogance. His argument is very insightful. He says, "It is easy for us to advise others not to be afraid," but it is difficult to teach him how to get rid of fear. If people deliberately analyze their own fears in detail to find out the reasons for their fear, then there will be countless ways to solve fear. Then you will realize that terror is actually unnecessary."</p>
<p>He believes that mistakes are not a pity. There are many things that cannot achieve true progress without going through mistakes. He says, "Whether a mistake occurs in society or in the manufacture of new machines, it must be discovered after practical research... We are not afraid of mistakes, because mistakes are part of our experience. However, if we do not consider the reasons for the mistake, or whether there is still a remedy for this mistake, and immediately abandon the business, then this is a real mistake. We can learn a lot of knowledge from mistakes. In addition to exploring defects, we also need to analyze them. We then proceed from analysis to appropriate criticism. Appropriate analysis and criticism lead to more valuable and more perfect working methods. In other words, it produces real progress." Finally, there is also a most valuable theory, the so-called sign of the times. In other words, how to observe the future era. He says, "Observing the subtle signs of the times is the method of making truth public to everyone." Knowledge has two major elements. One is knowledge of fundamental principles. The second is knowledge of the development of fundamental principles. One must have supreme knowledge to recognize what is growing and in which direction it is growing. This is the ability to observe the signs of the times. The so-called signs of the times do not refer to the current era, but to the signs of the future era."</p>
<p>"People who only want to understand the recent era are behind the times." Those who know the era will understand it before the era arrives. The so-called signs of the times here are the signs of the future era. The signs of today's era have already been indicated long ago. When the signs are realized, it is no longer a sign, but the era itself. Observing things superficially and observing things thoroughly are naturally different."</p>
<p>"Originally, what is called life is almost not expressed on the surface." What we see today is the product of the past, and the roots of the distant future are already contained in today. In fact, the people who penetrate life the deepest are the people who know the coming days. If you want to glimpse the signs of the times, you must do independent research. In detail, you must read what many people have not read. According to what I said, you must also read more things that have not yet been printed. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the fundamental values buried under all values and to make original judgments. Therefore, those who glimpse the signs of the times should not follow others, but should open up new paths and seek the principles that can be the basis for future changes. Life never ends, just like the river changes its course. Therefore, those who want to truly understand the river should follow the river's course and proceed, and should not linger in the dried-up riverbed. Life is also like this." Regarding Ford's writings, according to what the author knows, there is only this one. There are many aphorisms in the book. All ambitious young people should read it carefully. They will definitely get a lot of valuable help. And I hope that the publishing industry can produce more of this kind of product to provide powerful reference and verification for the new youth of the emerging China.</p>
