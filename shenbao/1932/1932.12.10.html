<p>（日内瓦）今日午後二時五十一分國聯大會繼續開會、主席希孟宣稱、大會主幹部業已集議、現提出决議案如下、</p>
<p>本大會接到根據一九三一年十二月十日行政院决議案而成立的調查委員國之報吿書、及雙方之意見書、與本年十一月二十一日至十一月二十八日行政院之會議紀錄、本大會又鑒於自本年十二月六日至十二月九日開大會時之討論、現請根據本年三月十一日之决議案、設立特别委員會、其職務爲㈠研究調查委員團之報吿書、雙方意見書、及大會所表示意見、以任何形式提交大會之建議㈡草擬提案、以期解决根據本年二月九日行政院决議案提交大會之爭議㈢在可能的最早的時期内將此提案送交大會、</p>
<p>主席希孟聲稱、旣無意見、此案可以成立、並謂此案旣通過、所有關於此項爭議之文件以及各種建議、皆須移交十九特委會、請其儘速工作、特委會有行動與討論之自由、將儘速召集之、</p>
<p>希孟旋提出法人愛文諾爲秘書長之任命、請大會核准、當即舉行投票、愛文諾在四十三票中得四十二票獲選、與會者對於退職秘書長德魯蒙頗多稱譽之詞、主席旋宣布大會工作暫停、俟後通吿、下次大會開會係非公開性質、而後即舉行行政院之公開會議云、</p>
<p>衆信十九特委會將於星期一日開會、但主席希孟因比國政治關係、不能與會、今日發生選舉代理主席問題、有人主張舉瑞士代表摩太於希孟缺席時代理主席、但此提議爲人反對、因摩太在大會集會時發言激昻也、目下似最有被選爲代理主席之希望者爲意代表、</p>

<p>（日内瓦）據聞英國現復出而領袖諸國、力求爲中日爭執覔一可行之解决方法、西門正謀於星期一召集十九國委員會、迅速擬成邀請美俄參加調解工作文、提交國聯大會通過後、立即電致華盛頓與莫斯科、推主席希孟此時猶未决定召集第一次十九國委員會日期、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>郭泰祺鄭重聲明拒絕中日直接交涉</p>
<h3 id="c33">同意邀請美俄參加滿案討論任何解决須依據盟約及公約之規定 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>（日内瓦）八日午後國聯大會續會時、中代表郭泰祺於哥倫比亞代表基柴度發言之後、起立致詞、首先說明中國之地位、　　（政府地位鞏固排貨合法自衛）謂排貨與義勇軍之活動、乃合法自衛之計畫、將繼續進行國民政府現頗穩固、權力日强、李頓報吿書有關於此事之聲明、而倫敦泰晤士報與上海字林報亦皆有證實其說之言論、可以覆按、郭氏言至此、乃宣讀報吿書及上述兩報之文</p>
<p>（堅拒直接交涉同意集合談判）郭氏旋申明中國堅决拒絕與日本直接談判之理由、但謂西門爵士所提出在國聯中而羅致美俄兩國在内之會議、中國可準備予以同意、此種會議須以本年三月十一日國聯决議案及李頓報吿書第九章第三節所主張「任何解决必須遵守國聯盟約非戰公約及九國公約之規定」一項爲根據、中國並堅持先須依照三月十一日决議案撤回軍隊、然後開會、中國忠於國聯、决計始終在國聯規守之範圍内辦理中日問題云、</p>
<p>（中日政策不同英日行爲逈異）郭氏取中國所定對於亞洲之政策、及日本軍人所定之政策、兩相比較、請衆注意、郭氏謂日人所謂「滿洲國」者、實爲日本對於世界各國之欺驅與侮辱行爲、星期二日日代表松岡曾提出一條基本要點、松岡詢問國聯任何會員是否準備擁護國聯强施解决、松岡以威嚇詞句提出此問、但渠（郭氏）决不以威嚇意思提出此問、此爲必須　答之根本問題、雖日本軍國之發言人在上海談判時、亦不能變更世界與論、渠個人深信國聯大會之極大權力、郭氏又謂英人在上海之行爲、尙有若干理由、因大規模之軍事行動或將危及外人租界也但日人則無此理由、而英人亦未有天空轟擊及開砲轟擊等舉動、日人在華之冒險投機事業、與英人行爲逈不相同、今若調英人行爲已成英人行爲之前例、此實對於文明的英國加以譭謗耳、</p>
<p>（日本幣價慘跌經濟力量有限）郭氏又言及中國之抵抗力、謂排貨與武裝反抗决不稍減、義勇軍决心奮戰到底、中國較諸捐稅與軍費不勝擔任之日本、有更大之支持力量、郭氏旋請會衆注意於目前日本幣價、較之去年已减至五分之二一事、並謂世界國家未有能長期在精神政治與經濟上處於孤立地位者、一星期前、行政院會議之兩日辯論、已使東京市塲各種股價跌落五磅音至七磅音不等、松岡所發中國不是有組織的國家、故不適用國聯盟約一語、即加拿大代表對之、似亦表同者、李頓報吿書早已駁斥之矣、而謂中政府可聽令中國土地被人分割、此實絕無意識之談、</p>
<p>（誓不承認僞國不爲武力屈服）郭氏旋鄭重言曰、余可吿大會、並吿日本者、吾人决不承認所謂「滿洲國」、吾人决不容許東三省土地被人攫取或東三省三千萬人民淪爲奴隷、余想在大會有代表之任何一國人民、未有不作此語者也、郭氏申述排貨爲絕對合法自衛之理由、謂去年美國有許多極負責任之公民、正式提議加入中國對日排貨之計畫、郭氏又稱、去年九一八前、日本曾以重大國際不美滿事件爲言、當時中政府願提交公斷、請國聯或其他公斷機關判决爭點、但日本不允而訴諸武力、是國聯之方法、日本並未試行之、</p>
<p>（忠實履行盟約一切不負責任）但中國則以其能力内所有之方法採行之、日本侵犯東三省、爲輓近歷史中所罕見之舉、然中國仍遵守國聯盟約非戰公約之義務、並忠實履行行政院所發不得有所作爲增重時局之勸吿、此種紀錄皆可覆按、凡宅心公正者、决不能譫中國與日本處於同等負責之地位、中國從前繼有過失、而中國仍準備提交法庭、但在國聯目前所遇之時局中、中國實不負絲毫責任也、</p>
<p>（强佔廣大土地謂非侵略而何）郭氏又稱、日本實無條約上權利可在去年九一八事變以前駐兵於鐵路區城、但尙有一事、較違法駐兵於鐵路區城一舉更爲重要者、即在鐵路區城外强佔數千哩廣大土地之問題是也、今謂此絕非大規模之軍事侵略行爲、寗非謬談、</p>
<p>（撤兵先决條件歡迎美俄參議）國聯大會之將來舉動、皆須以對於三月十一日大會决議案所定原則之極瑞尊重爲、</p>
<p>其根據與範圍、談判開始以前、有一必不可少之條件、即日軍之佔據、必須終止是也、昨日西門爵士稱、渠曾略聞直接談判之說、如西門爵士果有所閔、則非聞諸中國代表、中國不願與日本直接談判、荀有人懷抱中日可直接談判之意見、則此意見應予打銷、但國聯大會儘可倚賴中國竭力襄助、中國雖反對直接談判、但贊成由國聯辦理之集合的談判、中國以爲最好之機關可辦理此事者、無過於獲有美</p>

<p>俄兩國輔助之十九特委會、郭氏最　槪括中國之態度曰、中國準備作解决之談判、惟談判須集合性質、而由十九特委會辦理、在談判進行以前、大會宜通過一議案、聲明國聯會員不平承認「滿洲國」、</p>
<p>或與之發生關係、在談判之進行、須以三月十一日决議案與李頓報吿書第九章所載之原則爲根據、並受其限制、大會應以李頓調查團之判决爲其自已之判决、而聲明滿洲國之維持、實與國際義務相抵觸、故國聯任何會員决不得承認之、亦不得與之發生關係、苟無此種宣言、則談判决不能有結果也云、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c34">松岡强詞奪理 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>日代表松岡繼報吿言、對於大會中之言論、保留日後加以批評之權、謂目前渠不願詳細言之但前此發言人採取李頓報吿書中之片語作爲反對日本論調之根據、而不統閱全文、殊欠公允、</p>
<p>（李頓報吿自相矛盾）報吿書雖謂去年九一八日軍行動非合法自衛之計畫、但報吿書另有一節、則謂調查團並不　絕有關係的日本軍官自認其爲自衛行爲之假定、渠聞調查團員有苟不附以後節文字則不承認前節文字者、如大會欲獲證據則渠可準備招請調查員到會說明之、以罪名加諸日本、然後使日本證明其無罪、此乃極不公允事、前此代表之言論、完全出於誤會、渠對於郭泰祺關於日本情形之言論、保留日後發言權實則日本在世界恐慌潮流中、與他國同遭困苦耳、</p>
<p>（日但有軍人無軍閥）日本固軍人、但無軍閥、如曾爲首相之田中男爵等、皆出身寒微、可以爲　　、各代表所提出之各點、日代表早已答復過半、故渠請大會研究日本意見書、日軍之在滿洲、根據保護日人生命財產之條約、滿洲有日本臣民一百萬人、美國亦曾派兵至尼加拉圭保護美僑之生命財產、松岡繼言及西門所發雙方皆未承認李頓報吿書全部一語、謂渠願在西門言論上更進一言者、日本在李頓報吿書中見有調查團在不同意中之同意報吿書載有自相矛盾之文、明眼者同能察之也、調查團之得「不同意中中之同意、」或「同意之不同意、」此事已證明彼等各秉有天良、但報吿書自相矛盾之性質、使日本不能完全接受之、</p>
<p>（深悔當初加入國聯）意代表阿洛錫言謂國聯盟約有伸縮力、渠深以此說爲然、苟不注意及此、則國聯任何行動、將與國聯原則相反、日本前决計在凡爾賽加入國聯、初以爲美國必亦加入、但美國竟决計不加入當美國决計不加入時、日本之自私觀念亦主張日本不應加入、顧日本卒决計加入、因日本極欲對於國聯工作有所貢獻也、今日日本有許多人、覺日本事件未爲國聯所了解、欲退出國聯、</p>
<p>（爲生命奮鬥非好戰）日本遇有中國之嚴重狀態、及東亞之可怖的時局、日本現隻　奮鬥、以保全大局、而非造成戰爭、蘇俄現未加入國聯、故國聯必須有所伸縮、而不可有所行爲、一若俄美等國業已加入國聯者然、在大會發言者、有數人指國聯爲其存在之生命綫、日本則指滿洲爲日本之生命線、但發言人指國聯爲其生命線時、彼等固爲自私利而發言也、「滿洲國」可穩健的繼續發展、終將成遠東和平之基石、</p>
<p>（孡出三個傀儡代表）大會　知關於滿洲國之事實、與「滿洲國」有關係者現有三人實在日内瓦、如前任中國海關總稅務司愛德華即其一、其人已受「滿洲國」顧問之職矣、日本全體人民皆以銷釋其意見、而團結於政府之後、爲政府在滿洲行事之後援日本六千五百萬人團結而成一體、贊助此種行爲、諸君能謂此種人民皆發狂乎此誠荒謬談耳、日本人民之所以團結一致者、因認日本全部生存、即日本之生死繫於此　題也、縱有國聯盟約下最嚴峻之裁判、日本亦準備抵禦之、</p>
<p>（竟自稱爲中國救星）中國侵犯大津條約並着手增進其在朝鮮之勢力、又查日俄戰爭之最大因爲中俄反日之秘密盟約、如日本不戰勝俄國、今日尙有中國乎、當時日本救全中國、而在中國領袖避居日本時、日本並救全中華民國、　吾人接受而撤退滿洲軍隊、　首當决定者　人軍隊可　復秩序乎、中國或將要求此種主權、但此軍隊屬於何人統率乎、張學良之軍隊乎抑人之軍隊乎、但李頓報吿書固已聲明原狀莫可恢復矣、余恐人民將因此增數年之痛苦、報吿書謂中國必須有堅强中央政府、但如何始可得强有力之政府乎、</p>
<p>（俄日果成立妥恊歟）半年前日本報紙未有家主張對俄締結不侵略條約者、但今日多數報紙皆竭力主張訂此條約其故因俄國承認日本在滿洲之地位而不欲干涉之也、諸君一旦使中國人民存可得外來挼助之希望、則諸君一日不能得遠東之和平、蘇俄了解此稱眞相、國聯阻止各國加入任何方面、是在遠東已大　貢獻、</p>
<p>（又圖僞造我國民意）但中國今仍抱國聯必助華制日之觀念、吾人知中國有許多人民欲與日本諒解、但不敢公然表示其意思、恐被攻擊而置於死地也、歐美有若干人以爲世界輿情反對日本、日本與世界情感相反抗、以吾人所知、輿情現漸傾向日本、</p>
<p>（妄把日本比作耶穌）但繼謂世界與情反對日本、然一千年前之耶穌、不嘗爲世界輿情釘死於十字架乎、如日本今日在十字架上受裁判、則輿情不久必轉向日本也、</p>
<p>（誣我赤化轉移視聽）赤俄主義、今日在中國中部蔓延之廣、四倍於日本之土地、一旦日本地位挫弱、則赤俄主義將延及楊子江口、而遍及於中國更大部分、國聯希望世界和平遠東和平之念、果屬誠摯、則日本地位之鞏固、乃實現國聯此種希望之唯一工具也云、</p>

<p>㈠經濟政策之變更自十一月八日美國大總統選舉、民主黨羅斯福獲勝後、我國（日本）朝野上下人士、意以爲共和黨政府之亞西亞政策、必可變更、而日美間緊迫之外交關係、亦可緩和、實　美國之外交方針、恐非因大總統之更迭、即可期其改變也、溯美國之共和黨、以帝國主義的政策爲本、傾於資本家方面、民主黨以自由主義政策相標榜、重於農業勞動者方面、自歐洲大戰後、美國的帝國主義之色彩、日益濃厚、共和黨常得選舉之勝利、如哈定·古利溪·胡佛三氏、（皆由共和黨出身、）濫施其帝國主義的外交、其中受影響最大者、厥爲我日本、譬如山東靑島與其他利益之歸還中國、强迫我日本簽字九國條約、破壞日英同盟、制限日本移民與日本海軍之噸數等、我國（日本）處處受其製肘、然而今日美國因自身經濟的　慌、爲謀擁護資本家、反提高關稅之壁壘、爲謀發展經濟的霸權、致對歐洲債權之不安定、爲謀資本萬能的大量生產、反杜絕其銷路、至是國内失業者達數百萬、銀行公司之破產倒閉者、相繼不絕此皆因共和黨之政策所招致者也、今民主黨之經濟政策、即以挽回此悲慘的經濟現象相號召、而得選舉之勝利、抑不知共和民主兩黨之經濟政策、其意見之不同者、共和黨採保護貿易主義、而民主黨採自由貿易主義、殆如英國之保守黨與自由黨之主張歧異是已、因此民主黨羅斯福登政治舞台後、不過緩和偏利於資本家之保護政策、實行自由貿易主義而已、</p>
<p>㈡約翰海主義　民主黨之經濟政策、雖有改變、而其對外政策、亦隨之而變更乎、此爲吾人所最可注意者、原來美國之對外政策、素具有遠大目的、企圖百年之大計、故不能以政局之更迭變更其本來之方針吾人試就近代的美國史觀之、即可明其内容矣、故吾人高談民主黨當權、以爲可轉換美國之亞西亞政策、誠不解世界大勢之言也、查美國現今所採亞西亞政策、具有遠大目的、而且根深蒂固、蓋美國本有廣大的領土、與豐富之資源、但欲永遠保持其繁榮與福祉、實爲重大之問題、故自前世紀末葉以來、美國有識者咸以爲欲解决此問題之方法、不得不求大市塲於世界、然而加拿大及南美之面積雖廣、而人口稀少、且自來爲歡迎英國貨之地、阿非利加之大部分、係英國殖民地、且人口極少、其東隣印度、雖有三億之人口、亦爲英國之殖民地、澳洲亦然、至於歐洲各國、皆有自國之工業以供給自國之消費、美國深知其故、對外貿易惟有向亞西亞方面發展、而亞西亞之老大中國、人口達四億、不論何物、均須仰給於海外、美遂認爲惟一之主顧、故一八九九年、國務卿約翰海曾聲明美國之亞西亞政策、歷來美政府因襲此政策、而爲解决内外之方針、（未完）</p>

<p>（漁稅將免保障漁業）關於江浙漁民請求轄免漁稅以保障漁業事、實業部已加考慮、可予照准、惟我國沿海漁業、因漁具簡陋、故爲日人侵佔者甚多利益之損失至鉅故實業部對此已擬有整個之漁業計劃、主張多設漁業恊進會及其他各種有利漁民之機關以爲指導而謀改進、此種計劃、在即將召開之全國漁鹽會議中討論之惟漁稅雖准减免但爲發展漁業計、或將另徵一種稅收、總之、以取之於漁用之於漁爲原則、至本人將兼任江浙漁業局長之事、現未决定、</p>

<p>（復文内容）據市政府負責人發表、日方對擅捕金澈案抗議書、業有復文送達市府、其内容對金澈爲已歸化之華籍人民、表示不承認、其所持之理由、爲市政府因金等持有中國國民政府内政部第六十七號歸化證書、認爲金等係中國籍人民、然日方依照日本法律、凡入他國國籍者、須先取得日政府脫離日本國籍之允許、然後其所入之國籍方爲有效、現查金等未先取得日政府之許可、故對金等所入中國國籍爲無效、日方仍認金等爲韓籍僑民、</p>
<p>（咨部辦理）市政府負責人昨晨對新聲社記者表示、日方之復文、爲不合乎國際公法、蓋金之國籍、日方旣不承認其爲華籍人民、是以金之國際問題、遂成爲兩重國籍人民（ＤoubieＮationality）依國際公法之規定、凡遇有兩重國籍之人民之糾紛案件時、應就斯人所在地之國之國籍辦理、是以此案即金澈爲兩重國籍之人民、則今次日方之擅自越權逮捕、亦屬非理、因之市政府因該問題、係屬外交方面事宜、將咨請外部依法辦理、至向法領所提抗議、因金澈釋放後、日領業將財物退出、故在法方之責任、似已完畢、云云、</p>

<p>銀行界組織票據交換所近報</p>
<h3 id="c109">可節省兌換手續地點在銀行公會 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>本市銀行界、因感於票據互兌之手續麻煩、多勞往返、乃參照歐西各國之辦法、組織票據交換所、該所决定明年一月間成立、茲將關於該所各種消息、分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c110">組織動機 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>據銀行公會秘書長林康侯氏談、關於票據交換所、彼西洋各國早有成立、獨我國内銀行事業、並未十分發達、故尙付缺如實則此爲不可少之機關、因滬上銀行頗多每家銀行發行支票匯劃票等、而每家銀行每日收到其他各銀行之銀票殊多、如將該票飭人向各銀行兌換、則東西往返、將不勝其煩、因組織票據交換所、由每銀行派員至所中彼此將所收得之卽期票據、互相交換抵劃、旣省跋涉、且省時間、其便利固不待贅言也、</p>
<h3 id="c111">地點問題 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>該所係由銀行公會聯合準備科組織、銀行建造會址之先、對於附屬屋址、如銀行俱樂部·基金委員會·等、本在計劃之内而對於票據交換所之屋址、自亦在規劃中該會本有餘屋、故其地點亦假銀行俱樂部中、</p>

<p>至於成立日期、本可就早實况、惟因目下已屆年關各銀行結賬淸算事務甚繁故須略延、大致於明年正月間（卽下月）可以成立、因其組織手續、便爲簡易、目下加入該所之各銀行、計有中國·交通·浙江興業·中國實業·中國墾業·通商·中南·中華勸工·等數十家、</p>

<p>大東書局家庭敎育講座、昨日本定爲曁南大學敎授張耀翔講「兒童心理問題」後因張君另有他事、改由大東書局總編輯孟壽椿講「中美家庭的比較」其演詞略謂鄙人在美留學八年、於研求學術以外、也曾注意他們的家庭狀况、以備回國後作國人改良家庭的參考、現在先從組織講起美國人的家庭組織是小組織、我國是大組織、所以他們的家庭組織是異常簡單、不過他們還有寗同丈母居不願父母養的趨勢、因爲一家裏不能有兩個女主人丈母尙可聴從姑奶奶指揮、少奶奶便難聽老太太的指揮、姑媳衝突之事卽銷減於無形這也是美國人家庭中一種特點、所以我嘗稱美國家庭爲母系家庭、而中國則是父系的、此外尙有經濟道德婚姻等種種比較、極富趣味、因限於篇幅、不及備記、聞今日則係由張耀翔改講「我國的兒童生活」云、</p>

<h3 id="c238">方形堡的攻克（三） <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 法國美里美作業影譯</p>
<p>我們跟着衝鉻隊跑步前進：俄國兵突然發出三次呌喊，三次分明的呌喊，隨後便一聲不響，也不發鎗。</p>
<p>丨我不歡喜這種沉默，中隊長說；這完全不是好兆頭。</p>
<p>我覺得我們的兵士太吵閙一點，我不禁把他們那種紛亂的呌囂和敵人那種凛然的靜默暗暗地比較了一下。</p>
<p>我們很迅速地達到了方形堡的脚下，那些栅欄已被我們的砲彈毁壞了，土地也被我們的砲彈𦐸轉了。兵士們喊着「皇帝萬歲」，跳在那些新的頽垣壞壁上面，這次的呌喊比他們以前所發生的無數呌喊更加强大。�</p>
<p>我舉起了眼睛，而我將永遠不會忘記我所見到的景况。大部分的烟霧已經升上去了，像天蓋似的停在離方形堡二十尺的空間。穿過那靑藍色的氝氲，我們可以見到俄國兵在他們那半圮的堡壘後面，高舉着武器，靜穆得像彫像一般。我現在還似乎看見每個兵士左眼釘牢我們，右眼被自已舉起的槍掩藏着的樣子，距離我們幾步的地方，在一個砲口上，一個人手裡執着引火竿站在大砲旁邊。</p>
<p>我渾身戰慄着，我以爲我的最後的時候已經到來了。</p>
<p>丨好啦，跳舞就要開始了，晚安！我的中隊長喊着。</p>
<p>這是我所聽見的他最後發出的言語。</p>
<p>方形堡裏面發出了一片鼓聲。我看見所有的槍都傾斜着。我合上眼，我聽到一片恨人的爆發聲隨着一片呌喊和呻吟。我睜開眼睛，我很驚訝的發見我自已還存在世上。方形堡是重新給烟霧包圍了。我身旁盡是傷兵和死屍。我的中隊長偃臥在我的脚下：他的頭給一個砲彈轟得粉碎，我滿身侵染着他的腦髓和他的血。我們那一中隊裏面祇剩下六個兵士和我是活的。</p>
<p>接在這番屠殺之後的是暫時的驚愕。聯隊長把他的帽子放在劍端，首先攀上堡壘，同時高呼着『皇帝萬歲！』卽刻，所有活着的人都跟着他上去了。後來怎樣，我幾乎記不淸楚了。我不知道我們怎樣的跑進了方形堡。雙方在那濃密得看不見人的烟霧中肉搏着。我相信我會手刄過人，因爲我的軍刀上滿染着鮮血。末後，我聽到有人呌喊；『勝利！』烟霧漸漸减少了，我瞧見血和死屍蓋满了方形堡的泥土。那些大砲都埋葬在死屍堆底下。約莫二百人，穿着法國軍服，混　地集合在一塊，有的在裝着他們的槍，有的在擦他們的刺刀。站在他們一起的有十一個俄國俘虜。</p>
<p>聯隊長血淋淋的躺在砲台進口附近的一隻破碎了的彈藥箱上，幾個兵士急忙園繞着他；我走近去。</p>
<p>丨最老的中隊長在那兒？他問一個軍曹。</p>
<p>軍曹用一種很會表情的態度　着兩肩。</p>
<p>丨最老的中尉呢？</p>
<p>丨哪，這位先生是昨天到的。軍曹用一種非常鎭靜的聲音說。</p>
<p>聯隊長苦笑着。</p>
<p>丨那麽，先生，現在的你統率了；請你趕快呌人用運貨車把方形堡的進口弄得堅固起來，因爲敵人還有力量進攻呢；但Ｃ將軍會來援助你的。他對我說。</p>
<p>丨聯隊長，你受了重傷嗎？我問他。</p>
<p>丨啊······親愛的，但方形堡已經攻克了！</p>

<h3 id="c239">「愛國奬劵」 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>昨日本報載上海市地方協會致函市府，請制止所謂「愛國奬券」之發行。君子曰：這不僅是太「煞風景」，而且簡直像是「不准愛國」！</p>
<p>本來，自從去年九一八日本人大膽的爲我們製造出所謂「國難」以來，「國難」與「愛國」，便立刻成爲流行在我們嘴上的最摩登的口號。起初，大衆爲「國難」而哭，爲「愛國」而游行示威，於是，南京便常是擠滿了「愛國男兒」，而中山陵前尤洒下了不少的「悲壯之淚」。時間久一點大衆覺得眼淚究竟是有限，而游行示威也未免太吃力，於是「哭」，便一變而爲「呌」，「長期抵抗呀！」「武裝收回失地呀！」這樣，呌遍了全國！時間再久一點，大衆又覺得救國之道甚多。老是哭固然沒有這麽許多眼淚，老是呌也究竟有點傷精神，咱們只要保有點誠心，念念不忘，則何往而不適？而「長期抵抗」之道，亦即存乎其間正所謂「神而明之，存乎其人，」此念一轉，顧慮盡散，於是「哭」停「呌」止，大家又擺出「滿不在乎」的大國風度，打牌者旣可以打八圈「國難之牌，跳舞者亦不妨跳幾回「國難」之舞，至於「國難期間結婚」「國難期間做壽」則更是冠冕堂皇，言之成理，橫竪只要把「國難」或「愛國」和「打牌」「跳舞」之類聯繫起來，則「愛國」之道盡，而耿耿「樂中帶苦」的一顆心，亦已可爲人所共見，推而廣之，我們有錢，便不妨去欣賞「救國」的「游藝」去，我們有藝，也不妨「游藝救國」去，因爲這都是救國之大道，至於乾脆拿錢出來捐助在東北冰天雪地裏和日本兵厮殺的義勇軍，或者是自已投袂而起實行加入義勇軍和日本人硬幹，那都是寃大頭，都是　瓜！</p>
<p>大衆旣都是這樣的「愛國」「救國」，則「愛國奬券」之發行，又何嘗不是順應時代之潮流，行「愛國」之大道。而地方協會竟不准愛國奬券「愛國」，故君子又曰：「其失也偏，是烏乎可？」</p>

<p>淑華說了後，笑得很有趣的樣子。</p>
<p>『這裏冷呢，到敎室裏去談吧。』</p>
<p>海泉無論在什麽時候，都是不願意因爲無聊的談話儘拖延了時間。</p>
<p>『好的。到裏面去吧。也快要上課了。』</p>
<p>淑華響應着海泉。</p>
<p>『不要你到我們的神聖的敎室裏來！』</p>
<p>『誰要到你那個空氣渥濁的動物園裏去！······什麽也不懂，只是天天菩拉屎，買那屎！』</p>
<p>淑華向着　奎抽縮了一下她的鼻樑，隨後以她蹬着左脚上的高跟皮鞋，一翻身，她的大衣的裙脚便劃了一個半圓形，觸着了海泉的棉袍兒的下擺。</p>
<p>『對不起。』</p>
<p>她忽然又向他嫣然地一笑。</p>
<p>『不要緊。』</p>
<p>他回答了，同時他想，觸着了她的大衣的一部分，已經『三生有幸』了，怎麽她反對自已說對不起呢。</p>
<p>『不應當起這個觀念！』</p>
<p>他忙自抑制了一下情感的濫發，同時又回想到昨夜裏看影戲時，無意中和鶴子夫人握了一回手的情形來了。他想，</p>
<p>『男性總是多愛的。』</p>
<p>他們三個從校園的山徑穿過去，走到本館的左側門首來了。</p>
<p>又是一陣席捲着密密的黃塵的北風從本館後面撲向他們這邊來。他們忙走進裏面來了。他們的敎室是在樓下。卓女士的敎室是在三樓。</p>
<p>『快要下雪了。』</p>
<p>她說了後，隻手搭在扶欄上，踏上了幾級的扶梯。</p>
<p>他們兩個走進理科的敎室裏來了。的確，從外面進來，就聞着了一股不新鮮的氣味。同學大部分都到來了。有的坐着看報，有的在補抄筆記，有的站在窗口痴想，有的走上講壇上，拿了半枝粉條在黑板上大寫而特寫。</p>
<p>『今年的天氣特别冷得早。』</p>
<p>『×他娘！收了我們這多的學費，敎室裏火爐也不設備一個。』</p>
<p>『這樣冷。眞不願意寫筆記。』</p>
<p>『要求發講義！』</p>
<p>『贊成！有了講義，不上課也可以。』</p>
<p>『老王，那才寫意呢。有了講義，此刻還睡在被窩裏吧。哈，哈，哈！』</p>
<p>『老李　等於多少？』</p>
<p>有一個同學拿着一本筆記在問坐在他前頭的同學。</p>

<h3 id="c241">駡的研究 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 縐縐</p>
<p>以前有個德國人對我說，駡人的話，德國最發達，曾有駡人話的辭典出版。我聽了心裏暗想，這頂榮冠只怕輪不到德國人戴罷。我們中國敎育雖不普及，但駡人術却普及得很。不識字的村婦都是駡人的博士。若把中國各地的駡人話收集起來，一定能成一部極大極大的辭典。現在讓我把駡人話的由來及用法分類討論一下。總括的說，駡人的目的是要使被駡者聽了發生不快的感情。在這個總括的目的之下，便有種種方法產生了。㈠語云「人爲萬物之靈」，人類自古就以人類自尊，蔑視人類以外的動物的。因此產生了「畜生」「猪　」「狗婆養的」等駡法來了。㈡中國是儒敎的國家，特别崇拜祖宗的。而且因爲男性中心的社會，素來以爲性交一事是男性主動，女性被動，好像是主動者使宜，被動者吃虧的。因此產生了「×你的娘」「×你的祖宗」等的駡法了。女子駡人時駡「×你的娘」等，也無非是要以主動者自居的緣故。浙江肅山有「×你的爹」的駡法，　可由本條說明。這一種駡法，是極端尊重儒敎的反面，所以只限於中國有的。㈢因爲重男輕女的關係，把女子的生殖器絕端當作汚賤的東西看，因此駡女人時，有「臭×」「賤×」等的駡法產生了。㈣指摘被駡者不名譽的地方來羞辱他，例如「麻子」「　三」等。㈤死是人人所不願的，異樣的死法是更不願的。因此有「殺頭的」「殺千刀的」及「小鬼」「殺頭鬼」等駡法產生了。㈥駡人的話本是感情方面的話，所以往往一轉而當作感嘆詞用，成了說話人的口頭禪，例如廣東人對人說起話來：「先生，×那媽，昨日我走出門去，×那媽······。」等等，不勝枚舉。</p>
<h3 id="c242">我所縈懷的姊妹 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 碧遙女士</p>
<p>我們不認識的姊妹，出門皆是，認識的姊妹，也難以計數；然而刻在心坎最深處的，每人都不過幾個。我心坎裏的幾個，不一定她們和我的感情特别濃厚，而是她們不幸的身世，每個都代表一類人物，使我感觸到那一類典型時，便想起那一個姊妹。雖則生活飄萍無定，這幾個姊妹的面影，郤根深蒂固地種在我的心田，不時地抽出回憶之花，令人悵惘不能自已。</p>
<p>一·受難的壓紅</p>
<p>壓紅在十七八歲以前，眞所謂芙蓉如面柳如眉，她父親惟恐她紅顏命薄，所以給她取了這名字。丨其實當時早已種下薄命的根苗。淸末的思想，女子只要長壽，嫁一個丈夫偕老濟眉，便是大福；至於業方的精神調與可調，那是無關的了。她是生來便有了丈夫，不，她是因爲世上已經締結那麽一樁婚約，才應召而來的。當她呱呱墮地時，她的指腹爲婚的丈夫，正在院子裏騎竹馬哩！那男孩在七八歲上，患了一塲重病。到全愈時損失了聰明的大半，而成爲半白痴。以後同在一個學校讀書，壓紅在甲班做领袖，他便在丁班做殿軍。這是宣統年代的事，那時男女同學，見面不通語言；可是作惡的男生，每每於上課之前，在黑板上大書「人面冬瓜相映紅」一類的句子。冬瓜即是傻瓜的意思，壓紅見了，老是垂頭含淚。民國六七年，她在普通師範科畢了業，那時是絕對的賢母良妻敎育時代，封建的道德眞操觀念，還瀰漫在知識婦女的世界。壓紅在此情勢之下，除郤愁病以外，别無方法。到了婚期，她辭了敎員的職務，悄悄地歸來，儼如赴太廟作犧牲的小羊，温順地被花與抬了過去。此後十餘年來，受盡了無理解的丈夫的虐待，平日不許看書和報，不許在社會服務。只許閑在了無生氣，無所事事的家園。有時稍拂其意，還要拳脚交加；壓紅只是咬緊牙關，聽天由命。近來那豐腴適度的身材，聽說已瘦得和乾柴一樣，並還時常咳吐鮮紅的血汁呢。</p>
<p>二·瘋狂的白仙</p>
<p>白仙是女學初興期的才媛，她和貧困無依的境遇奮鬥，在國内的普通師範畢了業，又到外國投入大學。每當留學生集會討論祖國的問題時，常常可以聽到她激昂　　的議論。但自民國十三四年以後，便不見她的形跡。原來戀愛至上的潮流，捲了她到另一天地。她沒沉在甜蜜的幻夢之中，而和人羣離隔了。當地她手創的婦女恊會，因是而受重大打擊，大有「斯人不出，於會務何」之嘆。數年之後，忽然聽到她情塲失敗，三度爲尼，兩度蹈海的消息；近有友人從安徽來，說她知覺已全部錯亂，僅由親　的保護，寄居某名山的寺内。人生的變化，竟然這般劇烈！回憶也出國之初，對社會問題丨尤其是對婦女問題丨懷着何等的抱負，而今半痴半呆，反不及山間的　鹿！倘然她的精神，能得一刻克恢復先前的淸醒，吿訴她有一人爲了戀愛，失了整個的心靈，我想她必定有一番合理的評判。誰能不惋惜她處理自身的問題時，太任感情，太缺少了理智呢？</p>

<p>— 鋸泉</p>
<p>跳舞是人類諧律的運動的表現，原始人類便已具有這一種本能。往古野蠻部落當行獵成戰爭勝利之後，都有一種跳舞，以表示欣悅。以後文化進步，跳舞便成爲藝術的一種。到了文藝復興時代，梅狄西（Ｍedici）提倡跳舞藝術，於是跳舞術從此便非常流行。現在，在歐洲，流行最廣的是華爾茲舞（Ｗaltz）。華爾茲是一種前後進退的舞式，用三拍子的音樂。大音樂家的翰（Ｊohann）和施德勞斯（Ｓtrauso）曾專爲華爾茲作曲，所以在歐洲跳舞塲中，頗風靡一時。</p>
<p>在大戰以前，巴黎盛行南美洲的跳舞，如巴西的“Ｍaxine”舞，阿根廷的“Ｔango”舞，巴拉圭的“Ｓantate”舞，有人稱爲印象主義的跳舞。後來立方派勃興，使跳舞成爲一種獨立的藝術。從前跳舞是注入於音樂的，而新派跳舞則離開音樂有佔獨立的地位。</p>
<p>現在我們所要講的是未來派的跳舞。意大利未來派藝術家馬利尼蒂（Ｍarinetti）等人，新近發表未來派跳舞（ＬaＤanseＦuturiste）的宣言書，主張把未來派藝術的原則，應用到跳舞上去。他的宣言裏，起首講跳舞藝術的歷史的徑路。在原始時代，人類對於宇宙的不可知和不可測的恐怖，在跳舞術上表現出來。所以野蠻人的跳舞，以模擬天象丨日月的旋進，星辰的運行丨的居多。以後人類的文化增進，於是跳舞術漸漸能表現人體的自發的動作了。未來派是竭力贊揚物質文明的，機械的動作是物質文明的要素，所以未來派以爲文明人的跳舞所應該模擬的，便是這一種動作。又對於音樂的見解，未來派的主張也很别緻。他們以爲向來所用的音樂，乃是一種病的狀態的藝術，未來派跳舞所用的音樂，應該不是音樂，而是「喧聲」丨用固形物體，流質，或壓搾氣體震動所成的「喧聲」。因爲只有這喧聲，才能夠表現出人類的機械生活。未來派藝術家魯莎羅（ＬuigiＲusoro）便根據了這個原則，發明出製造喧聲的樂器，作跳舞時演奏之用。</p>
<p>現在我們舉出一個例如馬利尼蒂所倡導的未來派跳舞，有一種呌飛行舞（Ａviation）乃是模擬航空的動作的舞的時候，在地上舖着一張大地圖。上面張关一幅蔚藍的大幕，代表天色。跳舞的人在胸前掛一個推進機，頭上頂一具單翼飛行機的雛形。一邊跳舞，一邊便報吿飛行的高度，「三百米突了···五百米突了···』。場上更佈出靑色的山景，跳舞者須從山上跳過去。跳舞的時候，特製的樂器便發出狂風暴雨的聲音來。有時候更用電力在室中放出電火來，表示閃電的景象。</p>
<p>總之，未來派的藝術方法，主旨是在於反對一切因襲的東西。從前的跳舞藝術以温柔，調和，匀整，沉靜爲特徵。未來派的跳舞，則是以暴烈顚倒，躁動爲主旨。這一種跳舞在歐洲小陸雖還沒有十分盛行，而且通俗社會很不歡迎，攻擊的讑調很多，但是未來派在現代各種藝術上，很顯然的已經别樹一幟了。</p>

<p>張汝偉生</p>
<p>吾人碌碌終年。精血過耗。冬令及時進補。乃養生之要道。惟選擇補品。難點有三。詳述如下。並以研究所得。一一爲之解决如后。</p>
<p>補品性皆滋膩流弊殊多</p>
<p>各項補品。性皆滋膩。服之胃呆便秘。飲食停頓。利未見而害紛呈。且味皆苦澀。氣尤難聞。如阿膠黃唇魚肝油等則其氣更覺腥臭難近。均不適口。脾胃消化最易停頓。惟「鷄汁」或「牛肉汁」。補力旣足。味又適口。服之飲食培增。絕無流弊。凡欲進補而畏服藥品者。服此最宜。</p>
<p>進補手續太多令人無恒</p>
<p>各項補品。選擇也。購置也。辨别眞僞道地也。配合也。煎煮也。依時服食也。或赴醫問藥也。或按日注射也。費時費事。手續太多。且收效甚緩。令人久而心懈。無恒之心。油然而生。於是中途停頓。效騐全無者比比皆是也。惟「鷄汁」與「牛肉汁」已由醫家研究督製。服用便利。毫無手續。</p>
<p>補品服過其量反蒙其害</p>
<p>服用補品。每日必有一定之度量。若服過其量。非但無益。必且流弊紛呈。譬如一人患血虧貧血之症。過服補血之品。則反成爲充血之症。易患中風等症。惟「鷄汁」及「牛肉汁」由醫界研究。規定每日服一瓶。其補力適當一日一人之需要也</p>

<h3 id="c272">風流案 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 梅村</p>
<p>每天翻開報紙，在本埠新聞上瞧着，總得找到一二篇關於風流的事件，報紙的盡量披露，在使社會人士覺悟，不要蹈这覆轍，風流儘管風流，閙到法庭上去，風頭總算是出了，難道是生意經麽？雖說徒刑是有期的，可是味道終覺不像魚肉那樣的來得可口，不過爲着有期限的緣故，冒險份子，也就不妨試探一下了。</p>
<p>風流派的人物，小生老生都有，最近載着一段新聞說，有個三十一歲的老姑娘，奔到蘇州去和情人結婚，因此，父親跟踪到蘇州，在法庭上起訴她的丈夫騙婚，還有一段說，四川帮掮客某某，誘姦未滿十六歲的女子，判處徒刑三年又六個月，他們都是小生派的人物，風流的情節，各有各的巧妙，一個已判處徒刑了，一個還待解决，以風流朋友而拉到法庭上去，未免不大漂亮罷，</p>
<p>如果你要漂亮，識相的話，那末只要先到西藏路（近跑馬廳）六馬路愛多亞路（近大世界）一帶去，開開眼界，橫掛直懸着的黑底白字招牌上，可以認識些風流病的救星，然後再實行您的可免涉訟的風流案，那還比較化得來，可是話又說回來了，這樣做法，漂亮是漂亮了，識相是識相了，并且還替大人先生們打算打算，亦不失他的所謂人格，但不是這樣講，您只要看去年的一齣老生戲，他老人家佈置得怎樣周密，漂亮識相，都能兼顧，而且還冠冕堂皇，雖也曾引起不少報紙的批評，然而沒有在法庭上閙徒刑的事，有的說，有了金錢和權勢，無論什麽事，都可以馬虎過去的？我也是這樣想！</p>
<p>國家和國家的風流案，也未嘗不可以一警，不過以國聯做我們的唯一判斷的法庭，未免有些不可靠罷，明明知其不可靠，而偏偏付與牠解决，只爲對方宣傳和權勢的魔力作祟，最妥的權宜辦法，還是請等着吧，</p>
<p>末了，我們要飲水思源，不得不去感謝那位風流小生，「不愛江山愛美人」，造成這樣重大的風流孽障，</p>

<p>㈠</p>
<p>要是你生來有幾分力氣的話，你不　在學校裏獲得一個享有特殊權利的運動員。儘可以穿着釘有紅s的運動衣一步三搖的去上課，儘可以在上課的時候在房裏開留聲機，喝牛奶······儘可以拔出拳頭就打人，開口就駡人。儘可以······總而言之，表明他是一位「大亨」。</p>
<p>㈡</p>
<p>在學校裏厠所和浴室是言論絕對自由的地方。不信在浴室的板壁上總有幾句什麽「×××是sＰ」，「×××是賊」，「×校長是大砲」。</p>
<p>㈢</p>
<p>天氣漸漸底冷了。於是早操亦就成爲同學所最怨恨的東西，可是缺席太多了對於將來畢業是很有關係的，那麽祇有請人代到，或者託辭有病。識想的體操敎員决不會來查究的。</p>
<p>㈣</p>
<p>在飯堂裏盛飯的時候就可以證明「强權勝過公理」。祇要身强力大就可以把飯瓢子奪過來。盛自已的飯，别人站了多久是和他無關的。</p>
<p>㈤</p>
<p>我做了一個小小的統計。就是×先生在上哲學課的時候，平均每一分鐘有十三個「呵」字，當他講書的時候。</p>
<p>㈥</p>
<p>算學中有一條定理是Ａ＋Ｂ＝Ｃ。我想正可以把他改成最合時代性的東西，就是（愛）＋（皮）＝死，我來把他解釋一下：就是倆人相愛再加皮大衣，或是皮酒，說得苛刻一點就是「皮肉關係」，末了倆個人都自殺。</p>
<p>㈦</p>
<p>在上課的時候要是學生時時的掏出表來看時候，就足以代表先生沒得太　，不會滑稽。引不起學生的注意力。</p>
<p>㈧</p>
<p>一般少爺公子們的學生，呌他們用心於功課那是萬難又萬難。如果問他「聖誕節」和「陽曆新年」是禮拜幾，學校中放幾天假。那是决不會不曉得的。</p>

<p>在我們學校裏每逢有演講會的時候，如果站在台上指手劃脚的是一位黃髮碧眼的外國人，那台下就靜得如沒有人一般。可是每逢做紀念週的時候那就大不相同了。有打架的，有吃東西的，有看小說的······總之是美不勝收。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個未曾受過完全敎育的不幸人，將要學業期滿的靑年。自從高中畢業以後，我的志願和父親的期望，都欲繼續的進初中高中大學的，可是吾國敎育制度的貴族化，社會的不景氣，和種種環境的壓迫，隨處都使我這求學的志願發生種種障碍，於是最後終不得不走入輟學的一途了。輟學後，託親戚朋友在外營謀，約隔了幾個月的光景，承親戚的厚情，薦舉到本縣火油公司學業。進店後，就發生學識不足的恐慌；而且這片公司約創立了一年的光景，以營業淸淡，開支浩大的緣故，就歇業了。丨中略丨</p>
<p>後來輾轉又承先前代我薦事的至親的推愛，囑我到他的花紗字號中充當助賬，到現在已有一年了，仍在他號中，以待良好的機會。然而我輩靑年的寳貴光陰，却如矢離弦的過去丨學識一無長進，能不嘆息丨惟今後怎能使我再行得到讀書的機書；滿足我求智的慾望；踏上光明大道，却是一籌莫展。正在愁眉不展的當兒，忽見貴報六十週紀念，特闢店員通訊欄，專爲工商界職員學徒解答難題。用敢不揣冒昩。乞以金玉良言指示是禱！</p>
<p>朱晋林謹上十二月六日</p>
<p>編者按：具有極高的求知慾望而不得滿足，眞是世間最痛苦的事。朱君的煩悶，乃必然的現象。惟在中國今日這種社會經濟瀕於破產，敎育制度如此不健全的狀况之下，我們單就上海一埠而論，與朱君同病相憐者也不知有多少萬靑年。所以特將朱君這封信公開的提出來討論。除略貢愚見外，並祈讀者踴躍參加意見。</p>
<p>第一：我們覺得能入學校讀書當然最好，但萬一爲環境所不許而無此機會時，不入學校也可以讀書，因爲學問是終身的事業，書籍又復浩如烟海，若專靠在學校裏面，究竟能讀幾多書哩丨再就現在的學校而言，缺點正多。那些設備不周或帶有營業意味的暫且不說；即成續之較佳者，其能給予學生的實益，亦至有限。用功的學生，讀到大學畢業，充其量也不過知道讀書的方法和學問的門徑而已。欲求高深的造詣，仍有待於畢，業後繼續不斷的努力，何嘗完全是在學校裏面獲得的哩。</p>
<p>第二：欲求智識的充足和學問的增進，固然有讀書的必要；但書本不過是記錄人們的思想經騐或叙述各種事物的符號，並不是解决一切問題的「萬應靈膏。」假使對於社會無相當的觀察，事理無相當的了解，光去抽着書本讀，不但於智識無所裨益，而且往往會越讀越糊塗，所謂「善讀者則足以增其智，不善讀者則足以益其愚，」也就是這個道理。何况，宇宙原是無所不包無所不有的一本書，其間事物未經過人爲的記載還多得很，若只憑着書本以潯求一切，那胸襟未免太狹隘了。</p>
<p>上述兩點說起來似乎太超越了，實在的，我們若肯細心一玩，也是很平常的道理。朱君素昔未免惑於一般人的論調，以致發生極大的煩悶：在我以爲朱君的環境還不差，很有自修的機會。做一位助理賬房比較普通學徒總算是優越得多了，不妨在空餘的光陰中，每日確定一二小時，專事研讀，積年纍月，則學問就在無形中增進了。遇有不懂的地方，可以虚心的就敎於人，人家沒有不吿示你的，這樣做去，雖然進步較慢、倘能孜孜不懈，無蹈一暴十寒的毛病，則終有成功的一天。</p>
<p>末了，我還希望朱君及與朱君有同樣感觸的朋友們，不要對於現在所處的環境抱過份的悲觀。須知道：世界上的大哲學家或大文學家，未受過充份的學校敎育而能成功的人很多，這固然與特殊的天才有關，其大部份則完全是從艱難困苦中奮鬭出來的。</p>
<p>但是我們深感這個問題的普遍性，希望讀者發表意見，當陸續在本欄公布，現在將這問題再寫在下面：『店員，學徒或練習生等，如何可滿足求知的慾望？』</p>

<p>— 泰瘦鷗</p>
<p>痛快的說我不是有血性，我是殘忍好殺。大槪是我那後母所給我的訓練太特别的緣故，從我懂得認字起，我便知道拼命。我不懂什麽是値得留戀的東西。隨時隨地，我總準備着用我的力和血，跟不利於我，或不滿意於我的敵人，拼一個同歸於盡。······再給你說淸楚些：你别怕！有幾次，我險些因酸素的衝動，要跟大經拼命呢！</p>
<p>還有一樁故事，可以順便講給你聽聽，但是，可愛的小猪羅，你晚上别做怕夢！</p>
<p>那時候，我還在口大學裏當着很舒服的大學生。有一個初夏的晚上，宿舍裏突然起一了陣紛擾，紛擾的原因，是爲我們的同學洪士光的被毆受傷。洪士光他是一個和我絕無何等情感的江北人。他受了塲，正像馬路上死了一個人一般的不足引起我的注意，更談不到憐惜和慰問了。</p>
<p>「這眞是太豈有此理了，洪士光以顧客的資格上某汽車公司去雇車，祇因一句話開罪了他們的管帳，便給十多個汽車夫打得這樣厲害！他的右眼怕不能保了！」</p>
<p>某汽車公司仗着洋商牌子，打官司倒不容易！」</p>
<p>同學們把洪士光被毆受塲的事件，像社會所聞一般地傳佈着，討論着，漸漸地激起了我的殺性；「法律所不能救濟的事情，惟有拼命可以解决。」在某一個禮拜六的深夜，我懷着這一個流血不嫌腥臭的念頭，灌飽了老酒，藏着一柄鋒利的短斧；也不搭車，憑兩條腿，找到了某汽車公司。那時天氣正熱，一班流氓式的車夫，都搭着各種不同的神氣非凡的臭架子，聚在車行的門口乘凉。誰也不會注意到我。</p>
<p>「噯呀！」一個大塊頭的肥肩，最先和我的利斧接觸。他們見我來得凶惡，便一齊提起板橙，竹帚，木棍，向我取大包圍勢。至少也有二十條大漢。我彷彿沒有看見一樣，半句話也不說，像發了瘋的大虫一般地儘揀他們人多處猛斫，猛撞，拳節，板橙，衝在我的身上，比紙製的還沒有力，我簡直不曾覺得一些痛。</p>
<p>殺聲驚動了街頭的巡捕，忙趕進來調解，對方是立即棄甲停戰；而我的一柄利斧，却兀是在廣闊的車塲上飛舞着。</p>
<p>一半是仗着身上的一套西裝的威武，一半也多虧臉上有給酒薫紅了的醉態的緣故，兩個巡捕不但不把我送進提籃橋的西牢裏去，而且還極小心地扶掖着我，代我喚了一輛人力車，恭送如儀。</p>
<p>才上車，我是十二分地得意；一雙空手相磨擦着，暗暗慶祝今夜的勝利。車子拉過了一半的路，夜風慢慢把我吹醒過來了：頭上，肩上，腿上，···沒一處沒有警報，原來我已遍體麟傷了！最第後，我又發現我的武器，！利斧丨也給巡捕先生沒收去了。</p>
<p>寳隆醫院三個月的病榻凄凉，便是我這一塲「路見不平，拔刀相助」的結果。洪士光却始終不曾知道這回事。</p>
<p>野蠻嗎？小朋友！殘忍嗎？老實說，我自已也未嘗不感悟到；但是，我總一能改啊！</p>
<p>感謝上帝丨全虧他賜了我這一個勇於拼命的血，使我到今天，畢竟能忍受了無限的犧牲的痛苦，自動地捨棄了你，丨整日夜繫在我心頭的你，抛擲了　片前程，搬下了老父孤兒，和我那最可憐的妻子，獨自望着十數年來，我所切齒痛恨的仇人丨日本獸軍丨的槍口投去了！</p>
<p>如其竟有人狂妄地「志士」，「烈士」的頭銜，來安放在我的名字下面，那我祇有慚愧，而不能拜受；因爲我這一次的投筆從軍，以身許國，不容掩飾地是爲着要保全你的名譽和幸福。爲國犧牲，不過是借着他好點綴死後風光罷了！所以，你儘可不必憐惜我，或是以此而悲傷，你儘安心地享受着你的大經所以獻給你的一切物質的享樂吧！</p>
<p>當我臨走的一天，雨下得很大的一天，找死的念頭是决定了；午飯時候，我特地改換了一身最新做，而你所認爲最漂亮的西裝，很小心地繫上了一條鮮艶的領帶。在仔細把鬍鬚剃過之後，又用一種香味最濃烈的頭水，且澆且梳，梳得兩行頭髮像黑墨畫上的一樣地平整。這般的打扮舒齊了。還在大衣廚的玻璃前鏡徘徊了一回。「眞不知道那一顆有福的子彈，來結果這麽一位豐神秀逸的好靑年！」我忽然異想天開，而又十二分的痛快地自已默忖着。</p>

<p>— 嘉南</p>
<p>有三四年看電影歷史的影迷們，誰也不會忘了好萊塢以悲角聞名的麗琳甘許吧，她沒有琵麗杜芙的美麗，南姗卡洛的甜，克萊拉寳的熱，也沒有嘉寳的神秘，但她主演的片子在任何的戲院開映時，沒有不滿坑滿谷，轟動一時的。她在以前的幾張默片像賴婚，紅字，情天血淚等名片中，由她的沉默，悲悽，的姿態和表情，不知賺了許多男女的同情淚。但從聲片時行以來，她的英名像已被維太風富托風吹了個乾凈。她並不像卓别林氏的反對聲片，也不是爲了她的聲音的不行，因爲她在ＵncleＶanya曾在紐約公演的舞台劇中，已有很圓滿的成績，最近在上海大戲院開映的ＲomanticＮightl一張聲片中，她也得了相當的好評。她的暫時歸田，原爲了和老闆們訂的條件不滿意，據說在米高梅的合同中，她要求有八千美金的週薪，公司不曾答應，她也就掉首回老家去了。</p>
<p>幾年來的辛苦，她已有了些積蓄。以後的生活，無需顧念。但她到對於戲劇的藝術，仍絕不忘情，她常對着鏡子研究面部的表情，和單簡的動作，和正確的姿態。除在當地的交際社會中週旋外，她常應戲院的約聘，登台表演，這並不是日暮窮途的反應，這正是她發展個性，保持光榮的機會。</p>
<p>最近她又在可羅洛陀Ｃolorado中央城公演「茶花女」是法國的名著，在影片中已由范倫鐵諾和瑤門塔文兩度不同的介紹給我們了，這次憑着麗琳甘許的天才和經騐在舞台上表演，她的成功是當然的。</p>
<p>由着這次的結果，好萊塢的老　們又眼紅了。合同的接洽，又在醞釀中，或許兩方都會遷就些的，我們預備着歡迎吧，</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c281">下層工作片評 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 介</p>
<p>約翰吉爾勃，自從有聲電影風行以後，他差不多把已往的光榮，都丢失盡了，「活屍」是有聲的：但是不但發音不能呌人歡迎，就是他表演技術方面，似乎也比不上無聲時代，他希望恢復他的聲譽，所以先作了一本小說，把自已假設作書中主人翁，果然美國人對他印象好多了；等那本小說排成了這部「下層工作」Ｄownstairs影片，他差不多把已往地位又失而復得，</p>
<p>「下層工作」，在卡而登映了，我們平素愛護他的人，當然希望看一看究竟，但是可惜，他並不能給我們理想中的滿意！</p>
<p>約翰很小心的改變了他的作風，地號的角色，不是已往的，丨多情溫矛的紳士，丨他飾的是險詐無義的僕歐，這一點，也許可以算成功，因爲他很適身份，能把一個，僞飾欺騙女性的劣男子的個性，充份的發揮出來、狠毒的内心，和善的外表，呌人很能了解他現在是在作什麽，他更良善的計策，把一切配角，都用次一等的演員，把一切重頭的表演，都放在自已身上，這樣一張很長的片子，竟成了他的獨脚戲，當然比較上容易討好多了，</p>
<p>劇情很緊張，而且很合理性，很現實化，片中的結媾，也可以看得過去，攝影挈忙了約翰許多精彩：光線全部都太暗了一點，也許是他特意如此，來描寫「下層」吧？！</p>
<p>配角都還好，保羅拉開斯Ｐaullukas，有些地方竟能喧賓奪主，兩個女角，平當得很；戲當作戲演，自然會過火或露出假來的，演員表上的許多人，在片子中者只幾百尺的出現而已，所以談不到什麽，</p>
<p>這一次，可以呌人滿意的，就是發音了，比已往約翰的聲片，有雲壤般的進步，</p>
<p>總之，無聲的約翰，給我們印象太好了；我們對于他聲片，希冀太奢了，不然的話，假設這片子中是别一個人演的，就可以算一張佳作，可以呌我們十分滿意！</p>
<p>現在國泰開映「黃梁一夢」“Ｋismst”原名「命也運也」後改今名，内容描寫裸宮，淋漓盡致，設景之偉大尤可驚人，下圖卽其中之一</p>

<p>— 鹤</p>
<p>聲聾“Ｔonedeafness’能使電影明星自己也不認識他或她在銀幕上發的聲音，這就是許多男女明星，當他或她第一次聽到影片上發出來的聲音時候，都要驚奇的。</p>
<p>「我的聲音發出來似乎很不自然」，或者說，「這簡捷不像我的聲音」據說拍拉蒙公司在試映「金髮愛神」時，這片的男主角ＨerbertＭavshall竟不認識他自已的聲音，他雖然曾經拍過幾張有聲片，但他說他片上發的聲音，總覺得聽不慣，</p>
<p>同時百老滙的舞台明星和ＧenevieveＴebin的姊妹ＶivianＺobin也有這樣的經騐，她現在在西席地密爾導演的ＴheＡignoftheＣross一片裏做一個呌Ｄacia的羅馬娼妓，試片的時候，她才第一次聽到了她在片上發出來的聲音。她說：「倘然這種聲音，算是我自已的聲音，眞使我自已也不相信了。」但是在試映室裏的人都說她的聲音是很準確」的。</p>
<p>拍拉蒙配聲部部長漢森，對于這種矛盾，曾作下列的說明，</p>
<p>「差不多每一個人對于他或她的聲音，總有些聲聾的」，通談話時，他聽得自已的聲音是經過一種身體的震動和耳膜的震動，但他從片上聽見的聲音祇有耳膜震動，而沒有身體的震動的。</p>

<p>— 愛蓮</p>
<p>明星公司三位台柱丨丨李萍倩，艾霞，孫敏丨丨的處女作「舊恨新愁」的確比以往的明星出品滿意得多。劇木編得很高明，導演技巧方面，也有可取之處</p>
<p>本事；是一個年少軍官，和他姑丈的妾發生了愛的關係。後來少年獨身出走，萍踪十八年。一朝回首，再到姑丈家中，那愛姬却已死去。他仍住舊居，對於他表妹諄諄敎誨。不料表妹情竇初開，愛芽怒發，他異常痛苦，不得已而裝瘋，迫使表妹移愛於另一少年云</p>
<p>導演；李萍倩手腕不弱遠勝鄭正秋一般舊派人。例如一起就是少年在舞場的放蕩不羈，然後由一張照片𢌞想到十八年前的舊事，再由一張别函中幻出火車，映出「從此流浪十七年」都是别具風味，始終緊張。</p>
<p>演員；聾稼農表演甚深刻；艾霞先飾姑丈之妾，平淡得很；後飾表妹，恰到好處。孫敏飾另一少年，有些大材小用。朱秋　尙適身份　　字幕，優劣參半，中央配的音樂不錯</p>
<p>結論，在今日國片中，當可算爲佼佼之作謹以維護國片之熱誠，請大家去欣賀一下。</p>

<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>笑完之後，我們現在要哭了。</p>
<p>哭比笑更容易，我們在初出娘胎的時候就會哭的。這還用得着費功夫去討論和練習嗎？</p>
<p>但是你如果在攝影場或是舞台上有過一點半點的經騐，係一定會知道哭的表情比笑尤其難做。一個大攝影場裏，每年不知要蹧蹋多少膠片在這一種無人不能的簡單表情上。「張小姐！李先生！你們那兩個哭的鏡頭明天還得要重新拍過！因爲剛印出來看過，這一回又像是笑！」這種掃興的口頭通吿，就連最富於攝影塲經騐的著名明星們都免不了，常常要聽到的。小公司因爲受經濟的限制，不滿意的鏡頭不能重新攝製。於是乎不得不剪去若干尺，全部中最重要的影片，僅僅爲了主角的哭像笑。</p>
<p>現在你先對鏡子去試一試不用呼吸帮助的哭。最先起變化的自然就是你的眉毛。有許多人也許以爲這樣的眉頭緊皺就算是哭了。在我國舊戲裏的哭容就是這樣子的。</p>
<p>第二起變化的就是你的嘴唇。哭的時候嘴唇常常是往下垂的，上唇微微向下伸長，而下唇和下巴便掛下去，將整個的臉長。</p>
<p>面部的筋肉完全變成哭的狀態了。但是還不能像哭。因爲你的眼光無論如何總像在那裏禾笑。</p>

<p>(He Zhuguo Lodges a Serious Protest with the Japanese Side)</p>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) A Japanese armored train, on the night of the eighth at 10 PM, arrived at the eastern entrance of Yuguan Station, firing several small steel shells. The train proceeded directly to the Shihe Iron Bridge, continuing to fire approximately ten more shells into the city, destroying the Beining Railway water tower, and wounding a watchman. The armored train then returned to Yuguan Station. The sound of the shelling shook the entire city, causing widespread panic. Our side, surprised by the sudden event and unclear about the other side's intentions, had Commander He Zhuguo engage in serious negotiations with Ochiai, the head of the Japanese garrison in Yuguan. Subsequently, the armored train ceased firing. In total, over twenty shells were fired, with nine solid shells and eight exploding shells landing in the city. One shell landed in front of the Education Bureau, one each on the main street in front of a combined total of twenty stores, one in front of a sundry shop, one each in front of the Qianfuxin Pharmacy, Fan Xiaoxiao Shop, and Zhao Baozi Shop, one each in front of the He residence and the Fifth Primary School on Beidajie, and one landed in the Wang family vegetable garden near the corner tower, without exploding. Additionally, outside the city, two shells landed in an open space at Xishuimen, two in the Wang family's land, two near the Xiaoling Temple, and one in front of the Chang residence at the western entrance of Shuncheng Street. Fortunately, no shells landed inside military or police facilities. (Ninth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) With the Northern Manchurian military operations nearing conclusion, the Japanese army is poised to advance into Rehe. On the evening of the eighth, an armored train departed Suizhong and arrived outside Yuguan at around 9 PM, firing over ten shells. He Zhuguo sent personnel to negotiate, but to no avail. At around 10 PM, it entered the Guan area and fired over ten shells at Shihezi near Qinhuangdao, retreating outside the Guan at 10 PM and firing thirty to forty shells. At 1 AM on the morning of the ninth, it re-entered the Guan area and fired over ten shells at Qinhuangdao Station, destroying the station water tower. At around 3 AM, it retreated outside the Guan. Military morale is indignant, but fortunately He Zhuguo remained calm, otherwise the situation would have been unimaginable. The people are in a state of panic, and on the ninth, they fled to Tianjin. (Ninth Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Japanese Side Claims It Was a Misunderstanding <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) Negotiations on the incident of the eighth night continue and are progressing well. The armored train will soon return outside the Guan. The Japanese explanation for the shelling is that it was due to a misunderstanding. Qinhuangdao is quiet and uneventful. (Ninth Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yesterday evening, at approximately 10 PM, a Japanese armored train suddenly arrived from Xiajiatun at the station inside the checkpoint at Shihe, outside the second Yangqi, and opened fire on the station with three shots, destroying the water tower next to the station. It then fiercely bombarded the city with three more shots, injuring many residents and damaging houses, causing great fear. Gunfire erupted everywhere. Our garrison troops inside the city strove to maintain calm and made proper arrangements. On one side, He Zhuguo dispatched a staff officer to meet with Ochiai, the head of the Japanese garrison, to inquire about the intentions behind the Japanese military's actions and request that they order the Japanese military to cease their actions, otherwise the Japanese side would be fully responsible for any unfortunate incidents. Ochiai claimed to be unaware of the details, but promised to immediately order the Japanese military to cease the shelling. Peace was only restored at 1 AM this morning. (Ninth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) News just received indicates that on the night of the sixth, a Japanese armored train opened fire and bombarded the area near Goubangzi. At the same time, Japanese troops stationed along the Jin-Chao Railway attempted to provoke a brigade of Chinese soldiers stationed at Chaoyang Temple. The Chinese soldiers maintained calm, and the Japanese military was unable to achieve their aims. According to news from Shanhaiguan, a Japanese armored train fired several volleys of shells last night, causing great shock among residents. He Zhuguo immediately protested to the Japanese military, and the Japanese military ceased the shelling. (Ninth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Japanese Side Forcibly Compels He Zhuguo to Sign <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese side is forcing He Zhuguo to sign, admitting that the Chinese were the first to open fire. How can everything be based solely on the Japanese side's claims? He has not yet agreed and has telegraphed the Military Council and the Provincial Government for instructions. Therefore, negotiations have not yet concluded. As of the evening of the ninth, traffic has not yet resumed. The Japanese concession in Tianjin is also tense, with Japanese armored vehicles patrolling all day, causing panic among the people. Shops close their doors in the evening, but order in the Chinese areas is as usual, with the military and police stepping up defenses. (Ninth Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Armored Train Advances West Twice <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to reliable sources, a Japanese armored train penetrated a certain location between Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao twice, once from 10 PM to the next hour, and once from 1 AM to 2 AM this morning. It fired shells on both occasions, but there was no material damage. Only the bottom of the water tank at Xihai Station (transliteration), about one mile inside Shanhaiguan, was pierced by four holes from the shells. (Ninth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>(Shanhaiguan) The aftermath of last night's incident is still under negotiation as of the time of this dispatch. At 9 AM this morning, a Japanese aircraft from outside the Guan flew low over Yuguan City twice for reconnaissance, causing even greater panic among residents, who are fleeing west in droves. Students from various schools have also voluntarily suspended classes and are taking trains back to their hometowns. Due to the destruction of the water tower at the Shihe Bridge, trains on the Beining Railway traveling east stop at Qinhuangdao. A few third-class carriages have been opened at Yuguan Station for passengers to transfer to westbound trains, which are extremely crowded. The armored train that fired the shells is still parked at Yuguan Station and has made no moves. Rumors are rampant, but the local situation remains stable. (Ninth Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Defense Force Headquarters announced today that an armored train belonging to the 8th Division of the Kwantung Army was dispatched to support the garrison team stationed about ten miles east of Shanhaiguan, in front of the area responsible for suppressing bandits. While replenishing coal and water on the way to Shanhaiguan at 10 PM last night, Chinese troops near the Great Wall suddenly opened fire with machine guns. The Japanese troops returned fire, and the Chinese troops immediately fell silent. After the sudden incident, the Japanese garrison in Shanhaiguan immediately adopted an emergency alert posture, evacuating all expatriates to the barracks. Women were also housed in barracks in Qinhuangdao. If the Chinese side takes no further action, the incident may not escalate, it was said. (Ninth Dispatch from the Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Araki Speaks to Reuters Reporter <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the sudden escalation of the situation near the Rehe border and Shanhaiguan, a Reuters reporter specifically met with Japanese Army Minister Araki today to inquire about the truth of the situation in that area. According to Araki, the situation near Shanhaiguan is not as serious as rumored, and therefore will not lead to serious changes. As for the rumors that Japanese aircraft bombed Chang'anbao on the 7th and that Chinese and Japanese troops clashed on the Rehe border, these have not been confirmed. As Araki was speaking with the Reuters reporter, an adjutant presented a telegram for review, which briefly reported the Shanhaiguan incident, stating that someone attacked a Japanese armored train, which immediately returned fire, and the other side immediately ceased attacking, so this matter is not significant. The reporter also asked what the situation on the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway was like after General Su Bingwen withdrew his troops. Army Minister Araki replied that although it is temporarily necessary to station troops between Manchuria, the current troops in Manchuria are sufficient to bear this additional task, without the need to increase troops from Japan. Moreover, he hopes to withdraw Japanese troops to the east of the Xing'an Mountains and hand over the defense of the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway to the "Manchukuo" army. Araki also said that the rumors that Soviet Russia was aiding Su Bingwen were completely unfounded. As for the danger of conflict as Japanese and Russian troops get closer, this is an overestimation. However, the two sides have not yet reached an understanding on measures to maintain border defenses and avoid conflict. Araki continued that the Japanese 6th Division will soon replace the 2nd Division in Manchuria. Unless there are major changes, there is no need to increase troops to Manchuria at present or in the future. The reporter also asked whether Ma Zhanshan was still alive. Araki's answer was quite ambiguous. He said that when the Russian Revolution broke out, it was rumored that Kerensky had died in St. Petersburg, but Kerensky later appeared in Paris. At the same time, there was also the case of Takamori Saigo, a Japanese loyalist of yesteryear, who was rumored to have died in the Satsuma Rebellion, but fifteen years later, it was said that Saigo was not dead, but this statement was later proven inaccurate.

<p>When "Manchukuo" became independent, it divided Xing'anling Province and Heilongjiang Province into three independent provinces of the East, North and South, abolishing the former counties and replacing them with Mongolian Banners. At that time, due to Su Bingwen's uprising, implementation was difficult. Now, the new system will be implemented. The Manchukuo government has already taken over Zhalantun and Boketu. West of Zhalantun, the Public Security Teams have been abolished and replaced by Security Teams, manned by Mongolian soldiers. (Ninth Dispatch from the Domei News Agency)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side is propagating that Soviet Russia has extradited Su Bingwen and forty others to the Japanese military authorities in Manzhouli. According to a certain important person, this one-sided Japanese propaganda is unbelievable. Soviet Russia is a neutral country, how could it extradite patriotic soldiers and civilians without combat power to the enemy? Moreover, this is not permitted by international law. Our side has instructed Mo Dehui to negotiate with the Soviet Russian authorities to escort Su et al. back to China. Su et al. have not telegraphed Ping in the last day or two. This side has already telegraphed Russia to inquire about the truth. (Ninth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The news that Su Bingwen had been handed over to the Japanese military is entirely a fabrication by a certain Japanese news agency. This has now been completely clarified. According to the Russian Embassy in Japan, the Soviet government has approved Su Bingwen's and the generals' requests and will escort them to Europe soon. They will then return to China via Europe. It is said that Su Bingwen et al. are scheduled to go to Moscow today and then transfer to Geneva. The Japanese side was panicked upon hearing this. According to Article 12 of the Soviet Constitution, the Communist Republic has the responsibility to protect political prisoners, so the Japanese military's demands have become a pipe dream. (Ninth Dispatch from the China United News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) An official from the former Russian Embassy said that this side had not received reports of Su Russia extraditing Su Bingwen.

<p>(Nanjing) Xiong Shihui arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the ninth and said that the red bandits in Jiangxi Province have been besieged by a large army, and their situation is desperate. The southern Jiangxi area has long been sealed off by the military, cutting off traffic and all food supplies in the bandit areas. The armies in eastern Jiangxi have repeatedly shelled the main force of the red bandits, and the remnants have fled in panic. The Fujian army has met them head-on and inflicted great losses on them. Recently, in the Jinxi area, the bandit side suffered more than 5,000 casualties and were in a very embarrassing situation. However, during this time of national crisis, there is no way to face the outside world without suppressing the reds and securing the country. Therefore, all the armies deeply understand the difficulties of the times and are unanimously continuing their efforts. Chairman Chiang will return to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression after attending the Third Plenary Session, striving to annihilate them all.

<p>The League of Nations special assembly, planned for this year on March 3rd, was convened due to the increasingly deteriorating situation in the Far East and the difficulty in mediating between China and Japan. On March 11th, it resolved Article 3, based on Article 15, Paragraph 9 of the Covenant. According to China's request, in order to comprehensively handle the Sino-Japanese dispute, it would proceed with the "conciliation method" stipulated in Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant, and apply the "recommendation procedure" stipulated in Paragraph 4 of the same article. Therefore, the Committee of Nineteen was established, its purpose being: "First, to stop the acts of war; second, to pay attention to the League of Nations Council's resolution of September 30, 1931, that Japanese troops should withdraw to within the railway zone, to reiterate the resolution of September 30th on December 10th, and to dispatch an investigation team to the Northeast; third, to resolve the dispute as soon as possible and strive to create a draft agreement; fourth, if necessary, to propose to the Assembly to seek the opinion of the International Court of Justice; fifth, to prepare a final report based on Article 15, Paragraph 4; sixth, to consider proposing emergency measures when necessary; seventh, to submit the first progress report to the Assembly in the near future (no later than May 1, 1932); eighth, all obligations to create documents and report to the Assembly must require the Assembly to notify the Committee." At that time, our representative Yan expressed silence because the instructions from our country had not arrived, while the Japanese representative Matsudaira declared abstention. The resolution was still passed unanimously with 45 votes.</p>
<p>Since this spring, the situation of the Sino-Japanese dispute has not only not eased but has become increasingly worse. Direct negotiations are impossible, and the report of the League of Nations investigation team is still awaiting confirmation, dragging on until today. The League of Nations Council meeting, from its opening on November 21st to its closing, produced no resolutions other than the war of words between the representatives of China and Japan. After one round of discussions by the Committee of Nineteen, it was handed over to the Assembly. In the Assembly, the representatives of Ireland, Spain, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden proposed "Please deny that the September 18th Incident was an act of self-defense by Japan and declare that the creation of 'Manchukuo' was the result of the presence of Japanese troops..." This is indeed a theory that explores the root cause and a key to Far Eastern peace. The suggestion to include the United States and Russia in the Committee is particularly important.</p>
<p>×　　　　×　　　　×　　　　×</p>
<p>In the past two days, most of the speakers at the League of Nations Assembly were from small countries, all of whom were able to set aside [blank space] to maintain peace. British Foreign Secretary Simon's speech stated that "the Manchurian problem has many unique features, and restoring the old state of affairs in the Northeast is an impossible solution. Sino-Japanese disputes should emphasize practicality and not ideals..." This newspaper's daily commentary yesterday already considered this judgment to be insufficient in its understanding. It has detailed our views on the unique features of the Manchurian problem, the restoration of the old state of affairs, practicality versus ideals, and direct negotiations, clarifying the hopes of our people. It is a fact known to the world that "Manchuria is Chinese territory, forcibly seized and occupied by Japanese military force," and "the two most powerful elements constituting Manchukuo are the presence of Japanese troops and the activities of Japanese officials." The Lytton Report has already recorded this clearly. Why does Foreign Secretary Simon ignore it and not mention it? Moreover, the occurrence of the September 18th Incident was actually a premeditated act by Japan. The Second Division of the Multiple Gate and the Twentieth Division of the Chamber, the former far away in Sendai, Japan, and the latter in Yongsan, Korea, were able to appear between Taoyang and Changchun on the night of September 18th to fight. The Lytton Report also stated, "The Japanese side had a precise preparatory plan... The Chinese side, in accordance with its instructions, did not attack the Japanese army and had no specific time or place to endanger the lives and property of Japanese residents... The military actions of the Japanese side that night cannot be regarded as a legitimate means of self-defense." Sir Lytton paid attention and listed them one by one in the report. Is Foreign Secretary Simon so forgetful? Is this what he means by emphasizing facts? Furthermore, who is it that has provoked today's dangerous phenomenon, brought about the future crisis in the Far East, broken the "equal opportunity," and implemented market monopoly? Can there be anything more "practical" than the fact that the three northeastern provinces are now devastated and thirty million people have become fish and meat, and that the League of Nations Covenant, the Pact of Paris, the Nine-Power Treaty, and all resolutions of the League of Nations have been torn up under the Japanese bayonet?</p>
<p>If Japan continues to exert its resources, utilize the impulse of national enthusiasm, and rely on its past financial and commercial relations with Southeast Asia and India, and even use its naval violence to dominate Shanghai, attack Hong Kong, and extend as far as Singapore, what will happen? Therefore, for the sake of the friendship between China and Britain and the maintenance of permanent peace in East Asia, we hope that British Foreign Secretary Simon will carefully consider this Sino-Japanese dispute again, and refrain from making one-sided claims to avoid leaving a century of harm to the world and causing more serious consequences.</p>
<p>×　　　　×　　　　×　　　　×</p>
<p>Although the four-nation proposal did not advocate using force to restrain the atrocities of Japanese militarism, it had a clear understanding of the September 18th Incident as an act of aggression and "Manchukuo" as a puppet state. The nineteen countries of the Committee of Nineteen, including Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Guatemala, Mexico, Norway, Panama, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Colombia, Belgium, Hungary, Sweden, Switzerland, and Errmo, either because they were far across the ocean or because they lacked the strength to do so, had the heart to advocate justice and maintain fairness, but lacked the power to restrain atrocities. Moreover, the United States of North America, which has interests in the Far East, and the Soviet Union, which is closely related to the Northeast, are both standing outside the League of Nations, allowing Japan to use its diplomatic magic to pursue its policy of aggression between anti-Russian and pro-Russian sentiments, seizing our country's land and seizing the world market, surpassing the German Empire before 1914. The United States is now preoccupied with its own affairs and has difficulty confronting Japan alone, while the Soviet Union is meticulously building its own country and still maintains its tradition of "ironic observation." All of this indirectly benefits the monopolistic imperialism of Japan and dares to pose a huge threat to international peace.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Simon truly lacks a correct understanding of the facts of the Shenyang Incident and the current situation, which we deeply regret. However, since he theoretically recognizes that "the League of Nations Covenant is our constitution, we cannot freely discard it, and we must try to maintain it and find a practical solution..." then Foreign Secretary Simon has never failed to uphold the League of Nations and has never failed to seek a solution quickly. Now that Japan has relied on its military force to discard international covenants and tear up all treaties since September 18th of last year, is there any "practical solution" other than using force to restrain Japan? As for the Committee of Nineteen adding the United States and Russia to become twenty-one countries and becoming a truly international cooperative mechanism, although it may not be able to immediately restrain Japan's actual effects, will peaceful mediation be more powerful?</p>
<p>The League of Nations Assembly ended perfunctorily, and the Sino-Japanese case was transferred back to the Committee of Nineteen to handle, with a deadline to submit a draft resolution in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly today did not make any concrete decisions regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute this afternoon and adjourned temporarily. The draft resolution proposed by small countries condemning Japan's policy of aggression was ultimately not passed due to the major powers siding with Japan. The Assembly only resolved to transfer the Lytton Report and all relevant opinions to the Committee of Nineteen, which will convene as soon as possible to formulate recommendations and report to the Assembly. This resolution by the Assembly is clearly beneficial to Japan. The entire practical issue of the Sino-Japanese dispute has deviated due to the strategy implemented by Japan, leading to the issue of international interference in China's reconstruction efforts. At this time, the situation of the League of Nations is indeed worse for China than it was in March of this year. Some even recognize Japan as a loyal member of the League of Nations, while China's current situation has become the object of discussion. The major powers, especially Britain and France, seem to be leaning towards Japan. In the face of the current unfavorable international situation, China has no way out other than self-help. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At 2:51 PM today, the League of Nations Assembly continued its meeting. Chairman Hymans declared that the main staff of the Assembly had already met and deliberated, and now presented the following resolution:</p>
<p>The Assembly has received the report of the Commission of Inquiry established in accordance with the Council resolution of December 10, 1931, the opinions of both parties, and the records of the Council meetings from November 21 to November 28 of this year. The Assembly, also taking into account the discussions held at the Assembly from December 6 to December 9 of this year, now requests the establishment of a special committee in accordance with the resolution of March 11 of this year. Its duties are: 1. To study the report of the Commission of Inquiry, the opinions of both parties, and the opinions expressed by the Assembly, and to submit recommendations to the Assembly in any form; 2. To draft proposals in order to resolve the dispute submitted to the Assembly in accordance with the Council resolution of February 9 of this year; 3. To submit these proposals to the Assembly at the earliest possible time.</p>
<p>Chairman Hymans stated that since there were no objections, the proposal could be established and said that since this proposal had been passed, all documents and suggestions related to this dispute must be transferred to the Committee of Nineteen, asking it to work as quickly as possible. The Committee has the freedom of action and discussion and will be convened as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Hymans then proposed the appointment of the French national Avenol as Secretary-General, requesting the Assembly to approve it. A vote was held immediately, and Avenol was elected with 42 votes out of 43. Those present praised the retiring Secretary-General Drummond. The Chairman then announced that the work of the Assembly was temporarily suspended and that the next Assembly meeting would be announced later and would be of a non-public nature, followed by a public meeting of the Council.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that the Committee of Nineteen will meet on Monday. However, Chairman Hymans cannot attend due to Belgian political reasons. The issue of electing an acting chairman arose today. Some advocated electing the Swiss representative Motta to act as chairman during Hymans' absence, but this proposal was opposed because Motta spoke vehemently at the Assembly meeting. Currently, the Italian representative seems to have the best chance of being elected as acting chairman.</p>
<p>When the Committee of Nineteen convenes on Monday, Chiang Kai-shek is determined to invite the United States and Russia to participate in the mediation work. The Committee will adjourn after holding another meeting and will reconvene after Christmas. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Assembly staff held a secret meeting at 10:05 this morning, attended by Chairman Hymans, British Foreign Secretary Simon, German Foreign Minister Neurath, Swiss President Motta, Spanish representative Madariaga, French Foreign Minister Pongou, Irish representative Connolly, and Italian representative Aloisi. They did not encounter any difficulties in deciding on the future procedures, because Hymans had already agreed with Japanese representative Sato on the procedural issues proposed by Matsuoka last night. The four-nation proposal will be transferred to the Committee of Nineteen together. It was subsequently decided to transfer all proposals and speeches to the Committee of Nineteen without any instructions. The meeting adjourned at 11:10.</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is reported that Britain has now re-emerged to lead the countries, seeking a feasible solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute. Simon is planning to convene the Committee of Nineteen on Monday to quickly draft a document inviting the United States and Russia to participate in the mediation work and submit it to the League of Nations Assembly for approval, and then immediately send it to Washington and Moscow. It is reported that Chairman Hymans has not yet decided on the date for convening the first meeting of the Committee of Nineteen. (Kuomintang dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi Solemnly Declares Rejection of Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<h3 id="e33">Agrees to Invite the United States and Russia to Participate in the Discussion of the Manchurian Issue, Any Solution Must Be Based on the Provisions of the Covenant and Treaties <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) At the continuation of the League of Nations Assembly on the afternoon of the 8th, Chinese representative Guo Taiqi rose to speak after the representative of Colombia, Quijano. First, he explained China's position [Government position is consolidated, boycott is legal, self-defense] stating that the boycott and the activities of the volunteer army are legitimate self-defense plans and will continue. The National Government is now quite stable and its power is growing. The Lytton Report has statements regarding this matter, and the London Times and the Shanghai North-China Daily News have also confirmed his statement, which can be verified. Guo then read out the report and the articles from the two newspapers mentioned above.</p>
<p>[Firmly rejects direct negotiations, agrees to collective negotiations] Guo then reiterated the reasons for China's firm rejection of direct negotiations with Japan but stated that China is prepared to agree to the conference proposed by Sir Simon within the League of Nations, including both the United States and Russia. This conference must be based on the League of Nations resolution of March 11 of this year and Section 3 of Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report, which states "Any solution must comply with the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant, the Pact of Paris, and the Nine-Power Treaty." China also insists that the troops must be withdrawn in accordance with the resolution of March 11 before the meeting can be held. China is loyal to the League of Nations and is determined to handle the Sino-Japanese issue within the scope of the League of Nations regulations from beginning to end.</p>
<p>[Different Sino-Japanese policies, vastly different British and Japanese behavior] Guo compared the policies set by China for Asia with the policies set by Japanese soldiers, asking the audience to pay attention. Guo stated that what the Japanese call "Manchukuo" is actually a deception and insult to the world by Japan. On Tuesday, Japanese representative Matsuoka proposed a basic point, asking whether any member of the League of Nations was prepared to support the League of Nations to forcibly impose a solution. Matsuoka asked this question with threatening words, but he (Guo) would never ask this question with threatening intent. This is a fundamental question that must be answered. Even the spokesmen of Japanese militarism could not change world opinion during the Shanghai negotiations. He personally deeply believes in the great power of the League of Nations Assembly. Guo also said that the British behavior in Shanghai has some reasons, because large-scale military actions may endanger foreign concessions, but the Japanese have no such reason, and the British have not engaged in aerial bombardment or artillery bombardment. The Japanese speculative ventures in China are vastly different from British behavior. To claim that British behavior has become a precedent for British behavior is actually slandering civilized Britain.</p>
<p>[Japanese currency plummets, economic strength is limited] Guo also spoke about China's resistance, stating that the boycott and armed resistance will never diminish, and the volunteer army is determined to fight to the end. China has greater support than Japan, which cannot afford the burden of taxes and military expenses. Guo then asked the audience to pay attention to the fact that the current Japanese currency has decreased to two-fifths compared to last year and stated that no country in the world can be isolated in spirit, politics, and economy for a long time. A week ago, the two-day debate at the Council meeting had already caused various stock prices in the Tokyo market to fall by five to seven pounds sterling. Matsuoka's statement that China is not an organized country and therefore the League of Nations Covenant does not apply to it was seemingly agreed upon by the Canadian representative. The Lytton Report has already refuted it, and to say that the Chinese government can allow Chinese land to be divided is completely nonsensical.</p>
<p>[Vows not to recognize the puppet state and will not succumb to force] Guo then solemnly said, I can tell the Assembly, and tell Japan, that we will never recognize the so-called "Manchukuo," and we will never allow the land of the three northeastern provinces to be seized or the thirty million people of the three northeastern provinces to be reduced to slavery. I think that there is not a single person in any country represented in the Assembly who would not say this. Guo stated the reasons why the boycott is an absolutely legitimate self-defense, stating that last year, many highly responsible citizens in the United States formally proposed to join China's plan to boycott Japan. Guo also stated that before September 18 of last year, Japan used major international unpleasant events as an excuse. At that time, the Chinese government was willing to submit the dispute to arbitration, asking the League of Nations or other arbitration organizations to adjudicate the disputed points, but Japan refused and resorted to force. The method of the League of Nations has not been tried by Japan.</p>
<p>[Faithfully fulfills the Covenant, not responsible for anything] But China has adopted all methods within its power. Japan's invasion of the three northeastern provinces is a rare event in modern history. However, China still abides by the obligations of the League of Nations Covenant and the Pact of Paris and faithfully fulfills the Council's advice not to take any actions that would aggravate the situation. These records can all be verified. Anyone with a fair mind cannot condemn China and Japan as being equally responsible. China has had faults in the past, and China is still prepared to submit to the court. But in the current situation encountered by the League of Nations, China bears no responsibility whatsoever.</p>
<p>[Forcibly occupies vast land, what is it if not aggression] Guo also stated that Japan has no treaty rights to station troops in the railway zone before the September 18th Incident of last year. But there is one thing that is more important than illegally stationing troops in the railway zone, that is, the problem of forcibly occupying thousands of miles of vast land outside the railway zone. To say that this is by no means a large-scale military aggression is a fallacy.</p>
<p>[Withdrawal of troops is a prerequisite, welcomes US and Russian participation] The future actions of the League of Nations Assembly must be based on the utmost respect for the principles set in the Assembly resolution of March 11.</p>
<p>Its basis and scope, before the start of negotiations, there is an indispensable condition, that is, the occupation by the Japanese army must end. Yesterday, Sir Simon said that he had briefly heard about direct negotiations. If Sir Simon had any concerns, then it was not heard from the Chinese representative. China is unwilling to negotiate directly with Japan. If anyone holds the opinion that China and Japan can negotiate directly, then this opinion should be dismissed. But the League of Nations Assembly can rely on China to do its best to assist. Although China opposes direct negotiations, it supports collective negotiations handled by the League of Nations. China believes that the best mechanism to handle this matter is none other than the Committee of Nineteen assisted by the United States and</p>

<p>Russia. Guo most [blank space] summarizes China's attitude: China is prepared to negotiate a solution, but the negotiations must be collective in nature and handled by the Committee of Nineteen. Before the negotiations begin, the Assembly should pass a resolution declaring that the members of the League of Nations do not recognize "Manchukuo" or have relations with it.</p>
<p>During the negotiations, they must be based on and restricted by the principles contained in the resolution of March 11 and Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report. The Assembly should take the judgment of the Lytton Investigation Team as its own judgment and declare that the maintenance of Manchukuo is contrary to international obligations, so no member of the League of Nations may recognize it or have relations with it. Without this declaration, the negotiations will not be able to produce results. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e34">Matsuoka's Forceful and Unreasonable Arguments <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Japanese representative Matsuoka continued his report, reserving the right to criticize the speeches made at the Assembly in the future, saying that he did not wish to elaborate at present, but that the previous speaker had taken phrases from the Lytton Report as the basis for opposing Japan's arguments, without reading the entire text, which was extremely unfair.</p>
<p>(The Lytton Report is Self-Contradictory) Although the report stated that the Japanese military's actions on September 18 last year were not a legitimate self-defense plan, another section of the report stated that the investigation team did not completely dismiss the assumption of related Japanese military officers that their actions were self-defense. He heard that some members of the investigation team would not acknowledge the former section without attaching the latter section. If the Assembly wished to obtain evidence, he could prepare to invite the investigators to attend the meeting for explanation. To add a crime to Japan and then make Japan prove its innocence was extremely unfair. The previous representative's remarks were completely based on misunderstanding. He reserved the right to speak later regarding Guo Taiqi's remarks about Japan's situation. In reality, Japan was suffering in the wave of world panic, just like other countries.</p>
<p>(Japan Only Has Soldiers, Not Warlords) Japan indeed has soldiers, but no warlords. Those such as Baron Tanaka, who had been Prime Minister, all came from humble origins, and could be taken as examples. The Japanese representative had already answered more than half of the points raised by the representatives, so he asked the Assembly to study Japan's written opinions. The Japanese military's presence in Manchuria was based on treaties to protect the lives and property of Japanese people. Manchuria had one million Japanese subjects. The United States had also sent troops to Nicaragua to protect the lives and property of American residents. Matsuoka then mentioned Simon's statement that neither side recognized the entire Lytton Report, saying that he wished to add to Simon's remarks that Japan saw in the Lytton Report a report of agreement amidst disagreement. Anyone with clear eyes could see the self-contradictory text. The investigation team's achievement of "agreement amidst disagreement" or "disagreement amidst agreement" proved that they each possessed a conscience, but the self-contradictory nature of the report made it impossible for Japan to fully accept it.</p>
<p>(Deep Regret for Joining the League of Nations Initially) The Italian representative Aloisi said that the League of Nations Covenant had flexibility. He deeply agreed with this statement. If this was not taken into account, any action by the League of Nations would contradict the principles of the League of Nations. Japan had initially decided to join the League of Nations in Versailles, initially believing that the United States would also join, but the United States ultimately decided not to join. When the United States decided not to join, Japan's selfish viewpoint also argued that Japan should not join. However, Japan ultimately decided to join because Japan sincerely wished to contribute to the work of the League of Nations. Today, many people in Japan feel that Japan's situation has not been understood by the League of Nations and want to withdraw from the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(Struggling for Life, Not Warmongering) Japan is encountering a serious situation in China and a terrible situation in East Asia. Japan is currently only struggling to preserve the overall situation, not to create war. Soviet Russia has not joined the League of Nations, so the League of Nations must have some flexibility and must not act as if countries such as Russia and the United States have already joined the League of Nations. Several speakers at the Assembly referred to the League of Nations as the lifeline of their existence. Japan refers to Manchuria as Japan's lifeline. However, when the speakers referred to the League of Nations as their lifeline, they were speaking out of selfish interests. "Manchukuo" can continue to develop steadily and will eventually become the cornerstone of peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>(Parading Three Puppet Representatives) The Assembly should know the facts about Manchukuo. There are currently three people in Geneva who are related to "Manchukuo," such as Edward, the former Chief Inspector of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, who has been appointed as an advisor to "Manchukuo." All the people of Japan are united behind the government to express their opinions and support the government's actions in Manchuria. The 65 million people of Japan are united as one to support these actions. Can you say that these people are all crazy? This is truly absurd. The reason why the Japanese people are united is that they believe that the entire survival of Japan, the life and death of Japan, depends on this issue. Even with the most severe judgment under the League of Nations Covenant, Japan is prepared to resist it.</p>
<p>(Actually Claiming to be the Savior of China) China violated the Otsu Treaty and began to increase its influence in Korea. Moreover, the greatest cause of the Russo-Japanese War was the secret anti-Japanese alliance between China and Russia. If Japan had not defeated Russia, would there still be China today? At that time, Japan saved all of China, and when the Chinese leaders took refuge in Japan, Japan also saved the entire Republic of China. If we accept and withdraw the Manchurian troops, the first thing to decide is who can restore order. China may demand this sovereignty, but who will command these troops? Zhang Xueliang's troops or someone else's troops? But the Lytton Report has already stated that the status quo cannot be restored. I fear that the people will suffer for several more years as a result. The report states that China must have a strong central government, but how can a strong government be obtained?</p>
<p>(Has a Compromise Really Been Reached Between Russia and Japan?) Six months ago, no Japanese newspapers advocated concluding a non-aggression treaty with Russia, but today, the majority of newspapers are vigorously advocating concluding such a treaty because Russia recognizes Japan's position in Manchuria and does not want to interfere. Once you give the Chinese people hope that they can obtain foreign assistance, you will not achieve peace in the Far East for a single day. Soviet Russia understands this truth. By preventing countries from joining any side, the League of Nations has made a great contribution in the Far East.</p>
<p>(Again Attempting to Fabricate Our National Opinion) However, China still clings to the idea that the League of Nations will help China to restrain Japan. We know that many people in China want to understand Japan, but dare not express their opinions publicly for fear of being attacked and put to death. Some people in Europe and America believe that world opinion opposes Japan and that Japan is resisting the world's sentiments. As far as we know, public opinion is gradually leaning towards Japan.</p>
<p>(Pretentiously Comparing Japan to Jesus) He then continued, saying that world opinion opposes Japan, but didn't Jesus, a thousand years ago, get crucified by world opinion? If Japan is being judged on the cross today, public opinion will soon turn to Japan as well.</p>
<p>(Falsely Accusing Us of Being Red to Divert Attention) Today, the spread of Red Communism in central China is four times the land area of Japan. Once Japan's position is weakened, Red Communism will extend to the mouth of the Yangtze River and spread to a greater part of China. If the League of Nations' desire for world peace and Far Eastern peace is sincere, then the consolidation of Japan's position is the only tool to realize the League of Nations' hopes, he said.</p>
<p>After Matsuoka finished speaking, Chairman Hymans declared that the main staff of the Assembly would meet at 10:00 a.m. the next day to consider the two draft resolutions and Matsuoka's request that the four-nation draft proposal be immediately put to a vote or immediately withdrawn. It was heard that the main staff would first consider the proposal put forward by Switzerland and Czechoslovakia to ask the 19-member special committee to study the matter and submit its resolution to the Assembly.</p>

<p>(Washington) Today, sources indicated that the United States is likely to consider the invitation to participate in the mediation committee to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, provided that the committee is sufficiently distinct from the League of Nations. If the committee's powers can avoid the application of League of Nations sanctions, it will be acceptable to the United States.

His purpose is mediation. He will do his utmost to give faithful support to both sides, as Lampson did in Shanghai last winter. In other words, Britain will act as a patient and faithful mediator between the two sides, with the assistance of other related countries, gradually leading to a solution acceptable to both sides.

<p>(London) The *Manchester Guardian* criticized the powerful figures in Geneva for planning to shelve the proposals of small countries regarding the Sino-Japanese issue because of the actions of a strong country, and said that the Lytton Report made judgments unfavorable to Japan on all important points. This truth cannot be concealed even by the most skilled debaters. It is heard that Britain and France want to leave this dispute to direct negotiations between China and Japan, which is highly objectionable. China is a good member of the League of Nations, and it would be shameful to abandon it as we do. The draft resolutions put forward by Switzerland and Czechoslovakia, advocating seeking a solution based on the Lytton Report, can be supported. But whatever action is taken, the League of Nations Assembly should be determined to decide whether or not to listen to Japan's departure. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>Zhang Qun Receives Representatives of Sichuan Army Stationed in Nanjing</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 9th and received representatives of the various Sichuan armies stationed in Nanjing, inquiring about the recent situation of the Sichuan army and advising the representatives to telegraph their superiors again to stop military action. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Zhang Qun arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai and stayed at the Central Hotel. In addition to attending the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, he also made contacts regarding Sichuan affairs. It is heard that after receiving Zhang's telegram of the 29th, some Sichuan generals replied to express their agreement. Liu Wenhui's reply telegram praised Zhang's profound insight and kind words, which could serve as the key to resolving the crisis. Regarding the establishment of the Sichuan Political Reorganization Committee, it happened to coincide with Hui's views. The source of the chaos in Sichuan lies in the fact that the various armies are competing for private gain and are unwilling to consider the people and the country. Hui, in his predicament, is constantly thinking of extricating himself, but merely entrusting himself to the military has been taken advantage of by Liu Xiang. However, since the seizure of Shunqing, Hui has not been concerned with anything else, but has ordered his troops to retreat step by step, striving to quell the war internally and maintain the country's reputation externally. However, forced by circumstances, he was ultimately unable to avoid it, which is truly heartbreaking. Fortunately, Elder Jin Kang has intervened and has sent telegrams to all parties to satisfy public opinion. Now that my brother has come forward to advocate, it can be seen that he will bring immeasurable benefits to his homeland and country. However, the situation in Sichuan is complex and requires great efforts to succeed. I hope that my brother will strive to carry out his original intention of saving Sichuan and the country, unite fellow Sichuanese in Nanjing and Shanghai, and request the central government to appoint special commissioners as soon as possible to formulate regulations for the Sichuan Political Reorganization Committee and then convene an organization to implement practical measures based on the 17th year of the National Government's order to reorganize Sichuan's administration, which should be implemented separately. As for the Chongqing army's offensive, it is very rampant and should be cut off by another telegram to create deterrence, so that the chaos in Sichuan can be permanently quelled and my brother's career can be permanently prosperous. I hope to hear your favorable reply. Liu Cunhou's reply telegram said, "Your telegram is full of earnest words and care for the homeland. The plan for governing Sichuan is fair and reasonable. I sincerely hope that the central government will take charge and implement it as soon as possible, so that the military and civilians of Sichuan will benefit greatly. I agree."

The expenses of the party department should be saved as much as possible. The necessary party fees should be donated by the party members and should not be paid by the provincial and county treasuries, in order to set an example of party members relying on the party. Each county party department should have 500 party members. If there are not enough, two counties will be combined into one party department. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>Britain Prepares to Pay Expiring War Debts in Cash and Asks the United States to Hold a Debt Meeting</p>
<h3 id="e55">The Paris Conference Decides on the Attitudes of Britain and France; the US Replies to the Second French Note <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 8th: The atmosphere here is filled with talk that Britain will pay its debts due on December 15, and that French Prime Minister Herriot will also advise France to pay its due interest. However, there has been no official criticism. It is believed that Herriot will soon send another note to the United States asking to hold a debt meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 9th: British Prime Minister MacDonald left Paris for Geneva last night and is expected to return to London this week, at which time he will immediately hold a cabinet meeting to draft another letter to the United States. Roughly, Britain will state in this letter that it will repay its debts in cash and express its satisfaction with the United States' statement that it is prepared to investigate the debt issue, but urge the United States to begin the investigation as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Contents of the US Reply to the British Note <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 8th: Regarding Britain's request to postpone payment of its USD 95.5 million debt to the US due on December 15, the United States has replied, which in effect amounts to a denial. The reply stated that the US President is prepared to cooperate with the British government through any appropriate agency to study the overall situation and consider methods to restore the stability of currency and exchange rates, revitalize trade, and promote prosperity. The United States welcomes close study of this matter by the US and Britain to prepare for the recommendations of the World Economic Conference, but this does not imply the cancellation of debts. In order to consider other forms of repayment with a view to expanding the US market for exports, it is necessary to conduct this study. In the view of the United States, the foreign debt problem is closely related to disarmament. The United States cannot agree with Britain's statement that US war debts were used entirely for destructive purposes, and that the repayment of these war debts has resulted in the collapse of world commerce and the concentration of large amounts of cash in the United States, and that the complete cancellation of war debts is necessary for world recovery. A large amount of US debt was indeed used to purchase non-destructive goods and was resold to others, and some of the US debt was used to maintain the exchange rates of the Allied countries outside the United States. The United States believes that Britain has overstated the impact of debt repayment on world recovery. As for the so-called debt repayment having exhausted the gold reserves of the debtor countries, there does not appear to be any factual evidence of this. The United States does not recognize the statement that the Lausanne Agreement was tacitly approved and endorsed by the United States. The US Congress appears to be able to approve a method of depositing gold pounds in London, which, at the appropriate time, would be remitted to the United States at the guaranteed US dollar price. However, it is heard that Britain is unwilling to follow this method because the impact on the foreign exchange market of a large number of British pounds awaiting remittance to the United States is no less severe than purchasing foreign exchange. The US government is deeply convinced that Congress can consider any reasonable method that facilitates the payment of the installment due on November 15.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 8th: The United States' reply to France's request to postpone payment of the December installment of its debt was delivered to the French embassy today.</p>
<p>▲ National Press Agency, Paris, 9th: The French parliament has scheduled a debate on the war debt issue for Sunday. French Prime Minister Herriot is expected to seek a compromise solution in the next few days that will not offend the United States and will not force France to pay. However, French newspapers predict that this win-win solution will be difficult to achieve. It is said that Herriot will suggest to the US government that the issue be submitted to the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague to delay the matter, but it is feared that the US government may not agree.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 8th: The meeting on war debts lasted four and a half hours and adjourned at 2:35 p.m. A communique was then issued stating that the British and French governments considered the status of the Lausanne Agreement and studied the difficulties arising from the repayment of debts on December 15. Although both countries retained the right to take individual action to deal with the matter, they both declared their common determination to seek international cooperation to promote world economic recovery. According to responsible sources, Britain will repay its next installment of debt to the US in gold bars. British Prime Minister MacDonald is scheduled to return to Geneva tonight, and Chamberlain will return to London.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 8th: Reuters has learned that the Lausanne Agreement will remain in effect regardless of whether the current installment of US debt is repaid. The agreement will not be declared invalid until a final and satisfactory solution cannot be reached with the United States. The British government has not yet reached a final agreement on debt repayment. Whatever the amount, the debt must be repaid entirely in cash.</p>

<p>▲ National Press Agency, Havana, 8th: After two years of implementing a dictatorship and suspending constitutional guarantees, the Cuban government today ordered President Cirardo to restore the constitution in five provinces and end military rule, with the exception of Havana province, where the capital is located. It is reported that Cuban President Machado once used military rule to suppress the revolution, but this ultimately led to uprisings by opponents. Five of his key men were assassinated, and the President was repeatedly in danger. Therefore, the current President has decided to make peace with the opposition party. It is said that the government representatives will meet with the representatives of the Revolutionary Committee in the near future to negotiate a number of compromises so that Havana province and the capital can also restore the constitution. It is said that the reason for excluding Havana province is that revolutionary activities are still extremely rampant in that area.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 9th - The German Parliament today passed on third reading, with 404 votes to 127, the motion submitted by the National Socialist Party on December 7th.

However, National Socialist Party members still deny the rumors that Strasser had a dispute with Hitler and wanted to withdraw from the party and resign as a member of parliament. It is speculated that the dispute between the two stems from Strasser's continued advocacy of cooperation with Chancellor Schleicher.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 9th - Rumors are circulating that President Hindenburg is seriously ill with a heart condition.

<h3 id="e65">The Democratic Party's Asian Policy (Part 1) <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun published on the 2nd of this month a lengthy article by Lieutenant General Sato Kiyokatsu entitled "The Change of U.S. President and its Asian Policy," detailing the future diplomatic policy of the United States and the inevitability of war with Japan. Readers of this article will understand the changes in the future international situation, and the conflict between Japan and the United States is not far off. We have translated it as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ Changes in Economic Policy</p>
<p>Since the victory of the Democratic Party's Roosevelt in the U.S. presidential election on November 8th, people in our country (Japan), both in the government and among the public, have believed that the Asian policy of the Republican government will inevitably change, and the tense diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States can be eased. In reality, the diplomatic policy of the United States is unlikely to change simply because of a change of president. Tracing back to the U.S. Republican Party, it is based on imperialistic policies, leaning towards capitalists; the Democratic Party advocates liberal policies, focusing on farmers and laborers. Since the European War, the imperialistic characteristics of the United States have become increasingly pronounced, and the Republican Party has frequently won elections, such as Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover (all of whom came from the Republican Party), who abused their imperialistic diplomacy. Among those most affected was our Japan, such as the return of Qingdao and other interests in Shandong to China, forcing our Japan to sign the Nine-Power Treaty, destroying the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and restricting the tonnage of the Japanese Navy, etc. Our country (Japan) has been constrained everywhere. However, today, due to its own economic panic, the United States, in order to protect capitalists, has raised tariff barriers; in order to develop economic hegemony, it has caused instability in European debts; in order to achieve mass production of capital supremacy, it has blocked its sales channels. As a result, millions of people in the country have lost their jobs, and the bankruptcies of banks and companies have occurred one after another. All of these are caused by the policies of the Republican Party. Now, the economic policy of the Democratic Party is to reverse this tragic economic phenomenon, and it has won the election victory. However, it is not known that the difference in opinion between the economic policies of the Republican and Democratic parties is that the Republican Party adopts protectionist trade, while the Democratic Party adopts free trade, much like the differences in opinion between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party in Britain. Therefore, after the Democratic Party's Roosevelt ascended to the political stage, he will only ease the protectionist policies that favor capitalists and implement free trade.</p>
<p>㈡ The Open Door Policy</p>
<p>Although the economic policy of the Democratic Party has changed, will its foreign policy also change accordingly? This is what we should pay the most attention to. Originally, the foreign policy of the United States has always had far-reaching goals, attempting to achieve a grand plan for a hundred years, so it cannot change its original direction due to changes in the political situation. If we try to view it from the perspective of modern American history, we can understand its content. Therefore, we are talking about the Democratic Party coming to power, thinking that it can change the United States' Asian policy, which is truly a lack of understanding of the world's trends. The current Asian policy adopted by the United States has far-reaching goals and is deeply rooted. The United States originally has vast territory and abundant resources, but how to maintain its prosperity and well-being forever is a major problem. Therefore, since the end of the last century, enlightened people in the United States have believed that the only way to solve this problem is to seek a large market in the world. However, although Canada and South America have vast areas, their populations are sparse, and they have always welcomed British goods. Most of Africa is a British colony, and the population is extremely small. Its eastern neighbor, India, although it has a population of 300 million, is also a British colony, as is Australia. As for the European countries, they all have their own industries to supply their own consumption. The United States knows this, and the only way to develop foreign trade is to develop towards Asia. The elderly China in Asia has a population of 400 million, and everything must be supplied from overseas. The United States considers it to be its only customer. Therefore, in 1899, Secretary of State John Hay declared the Asian policy of the United States. The U.S. government has inherited this policy to solve domestic and foreign problems.

<p>Record of the Chengdu Street Fighting Catastrophe</p>
<h3 id="e66">Prosperous City Streets Turned to Scorched Earth, Cultural Institutions Completely Destroyed, Student Deaths Exceed a Thousand <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing News - Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan Province, with an area of nine li and three fen, and a population of approximately 300,000. It is the cultural and political center of Western Sichuan, with wealth and bustling markets that surpass the entire province. Since the unprecedented massacre by the roving bandit Zhang Xianzhong at the end of the Ming Dynasty, it has gradually prospered over the past 300 years. In the past, when Sichuan Army's Liu Cunhou drove out Guizhou Army's Luo Peijin, there was a street fight. At that time, it was only in the Fucheng area in the center of the city, and the result was that Fucheng, which had a history of several hundred years, was transformed into a field of rubble, which has not yet been restored to its original state. Unexpectedly, during this Sichuan war, the 29th Army and the 24th Army actually waged war in the provincial capital. The intensity of the disaster and the depth of the damage not only far surpassed the Luo-Liu war but could be traced back to the tragedy of Zhang Xianzhong. The city was in ruins, and the dead were everywhere. It was truly a catastrophe unseen in 300 years. I previously wrote about the losses suffered by the people of Sichuan in the war, but Chengdu was only briefly mentioned because news was blocked at that time, and most of the information was obtained from rumors. Now that the street fighting has stopped, and postal and telecommunications have been restored, details are easier to obtain. Therefore, I am specially supplementing the account to serve as "Shu Bi" [Sichuan History] viewing.</p>
<p>(Street Fighting Lasted a Week)</p>
<p>The 29th Army and the 24th Army were locked in a stalemate in Chengdu for more than a month. Initially, Tian Songyao still intended to wait and see. When the 21st Army captured Luzhou, and Li Yang advanced and occupied Zizhong and Jianyang, he began to send troops to attack Liu Wenhui, resulting in street fighting. From the early morning of November 16th, the fighting lasted until the 24th. The Tian and Liu armies engaged in hand-to-hand combat 73 times. Initially, it was limited to the city, but later it spread to various areas attached to the city. The battle line stretched for more than 50 li. On the side of the 29th Army, 8 regimental commanders, more than 60 battalion commanders, more than 300 company and platoon leaders, and more than 5,400 soldiers died. On the side of the 24th Army, 9 regimental commanders, more than 40 battalion commanders, more than 400 company and platoon leaders, and more than 7,800 soldiers died. On the side of the 28th Army, some maintained neutrality, and some participated in the 29th Army's operations. 1 brigade commander, 2 regimental commanders, 1 battalion commander, 5 company and platoon leaders, and more than 800 soldiers died. As a result, more than 15,000 people from the Liu, Tian, and Deng armies died.</p>
<p>(More than 10,000 Civilians Died)</p>
<p>As for the civilian population, the Xinhua Street area (the gathering place for Chengdu prostitutes) became a battlefield. About 6,000 prostitutes died from stray bullets. In the area outside the city walls, more than 3,000 civilians died. Inside the city, except for Xinhua Street, more than 6,000 people died from stray bullets, including more than 1,500 students. Sichuan University, the highest academic institution in Sichuan and the cultural hub of southwestern China (formed by the merger of Sichuan University, Chengdu University, and Normal University), in the imperial city, had all its colleges, libraries, instrument rooms, etc., completely destroyed. A total of more than 500 male and female students of Sichuan University died. In total, more than 10,000 innocent people died, and about 40,000 houses were burned down by artillery fire and demolished by the army. The once-prosperous Dongda Street and the bustling Chunxi Road have now become fields of rubble. Businesses are scattered, and the streets are piled with stones. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness. At least the Sichuan Education Hall, Sichuan Library, Museum, Zoo, etc., on the side of the imperial city have also been reduced to flat ground. The culture of Sichuan and the antiques of hundreds of years have been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>(Newspapers Suspended Publication)</p>
<p>The 24th Army's newspaper, "Chuan Bao," published three large sheets a day and was quite influential. When the street fighting broke out, it was destroyed by the 29th Army. The 29th Army's newspapers, "National Daily News," "National Gazette," and "Current Affairs Weekly," etc., were also destroyed by the 24th Army. As for the other newspapers, either the editors were killed by stray bullets, or the responsible persons disappeared, making it impossible to publish. Only one or two newspapers began to publish after the street fighting completely stopped, but they did not dare to report on the street fighting situation. It was not until Tian Songyao and Liu Wenhui formally made peace, and Tian gave up Chengdu and the arsenal, that the situation in Chengdu gradually eased. At that time, the City Chamber of Commerce and gentry members initiated the organization of the Renshen Year Relief Society, established eight shelters to accommodate refugees whose houses had been destroyed, providing temporary accommodation, and established 24 porridge and cake factories to relieve the unemployed victims in the war zone, barely prolonging their lives. However, although the recent street fighting in Chengdu has completely stopped, and Tian Songyao has withdrawn from Chengdu, the defensive fortifications built in the streets and alleys have not only not been removed by the 24th Army but have also issued notices prohibiting destruction, and the engineering factory has been ordered to step up the production of weapons and make strict arrangements. Under these circumstances, Chengdu is likely to face a second major war. (December 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Scientific Communist Suppression <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 8th - Communist radio broadcasts have recently been discovered frequently in the Berlin skies, followed by wild singing of The Internationale. The police have been diligently investigating for two weeks. Today, thanks to the effectiveness of scientific instruments, they were finally able to detect that the radio station was located somewhere in the suburbs of Berlin. Therefore, the police rushed out and arrived at the destination. The people in the room were already dismantling the radio equipment, preparing to transport it to another location, and a car was waiting outside the door to depart. Three people were arrested at the time, and it is said that many more were involved. From now on, the Berlin skies can be a little quieter.</p>
<p>The Key to the Sichuan Situation Lies with Deng Xihou</p>
<h3 id="e68">Liu Wenhui Makes Every Effort to Court Deng, Deng Plays a Pivotal Role in Both Sides, Allied Generals Urge Deng to Clarify His Attitude <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing News - The long-pending Sichuan War is sometimes fierce and sometimes缓和，sometimes the two sides remain unmoved, and sometimes they draw their swords. Although the central government has issued a clear order to cease the war, and 70 million people in Sichuan are calling for peace, the giants ultimately ignore them like the autumn wind. Recently, in the Southern Route, the 21st Army and the 24th Army are locked in a stalemate in Jiading, with no progress. As for the war situation, in Renshou, the 21st Army is gradually advancing, and the 24th Army is gradually retreating. In the Central Route Longquanyi, Li Qixiang and Yang Sen are fiercely attacking the Liu army in the province because Tian Songyao is urging them to provide assistance, and fierce fighting has already occurred. Longquanyi is a barrier to Chengdu, only 60 li away from Chengdu. If Longquanyi is lost, Chengdu will be indefensible. Therefore, Liu Wenhui sent heavy troops to guard it, and it will be difficult to capture for a while. As for the 29th Army, which was defeated and retreated to the Xindu and Jintang areas, it has been urgently seeking to counterattack Chengdu to avenge the shame of its defeat. However, the Allied forces have not yet provided assistance, so they are still holding their troops. Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army, surrounded on all sides, is concentrating all the troops stationed in Xikang, such as the Hai Brigade, and other troops, in Jiading and Chengdu. Even if there is a warning that the Tibetan army is invading Xikang, Liu will find it difficult to cope with it. He is now prepared to fight the Allied forces with all his strength and determine the final victory or defeat. If defeated, he has indicated that he will hand over the entire 24th Army to Deng Xihou and travel alone. As for Deng Xihou's attitude, he is still unusually smooth. Deng originally sided with the Allied forces. When Tian Songyao led his troops to attack Liu Wenhui, he maintained neutrality on one hand, and on the other hand, he allowed his subordinates to join the 29th Army to attack Liu. When Tian was defeated, Deng took the position of mediator, playing his clever tricks and shifting the blame to his subordinates. Although Liu Wenhui knew this, he could do nothing. He could only express his goodwill to Deng and ask for his cooperation. On the one hand, he also hinted to his subordinates to repeatedly send telegrams to Deng, expressing support. Therefore, Deng did not turn against Liu. Currently, he has no clear indication to any party. However, the Allied forces believe that Deng's ambiguous attitude has a significant impact. If Deng cooperates with Liu Wenhui, he will inevitably call for the unity of the Bao faction and win over Tian Songyao. Although Tian and Liu Wenhui have a grudge, in view of their common interests, they have no choice but to cooperate temporarily. In this way, the strength of the three armies is no less than 200,000. If they launch a concerted attack on the Allied forces, it will be difficult to cope with. Therefore, on the 4th of this month, the generals of the 21st Army, 20th Army, Sichuan-Shaanxi Army, Li Jiayu, Luo Zezhou, and 29th Army sent a telegram to Deng Xihou, urging him to clarify his attitude as soon as possible. However, Deng has not yet made a clear indication. (December 7th)</p>
<p>Guangdong Plane Practice Crash</p>
<h3 id="e69">Pilot Killed, Squad Leader Slightly Injured, Cause of Accident Due to Engine Failure <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - The Guangdong Provincial Air Force, after establishing an examination committee to test the pilots of each team, immediately engaged in screening. After the screening, the Air Force Department sent instructors to actively train the pilots for days, teaching them wartime techniques, so that the Air Force Training Team could be established as soon as possible. At 9:00 a.m. on the 2nd of this month, according to the daily routine, a plane took off into the sky again from the Air Force airfield, engaged in practicing various combat maneuvers. The plane was named Albatross No. 6. The two people on board were the pilot of the Fourth Squadron, Zhong Runxiang, and the squad leader, Lu Yuheng, who was sitting in the back, directing Zhong to practice tactics. After taking off from the Shaogou airfield, they flew from south to north, about 3,000 feet above the ground, circled for a week, and then turned south, making a low-altitude bombing posture. When descending to a height of 300 feet, they felt a strange sound from the engine. They planned to land for repairs, but when the engine was raised again, the movement was as before. Thinking that the engine was in good condition, they no longer paid attention to it. From then on, they flew back and forth, performing various combat techniques. After flying in the sky for about half an hour, at 9:35, the Albatross No. 6 plane suddenly lost its slow movement and fell straight down from a height of 200 feet into a business in the northwest corner of the airfield. The pilot Zhong, in the front seat, bore the brunt of the impact. Squad Leader Lu was also thrown out, but only suffered abrasions to his lips and face and was still able to move. After the accident, Air Force personnel rushed to rescue Zhong and Lu. However, Zhong died on the spot due to his serious injuries. It was found that Zhong graduated from the second term of the Aviation School and was currently a lieutenant pilot in the Fourth Squadron, 23 years old, from Guanshanxu, Nanhai County. The captain of the Fourth Squadron, Xie Mang, immediately sent him to the coffin company due to his death, and telegraphed the relatives of the deceased to come and see the coffin, and planned to provide preferential treatment according to the example of those who died in the line of duty. As for the squad leader Lu Yuheng, who was involved in the same accident, because his injuries were very minor, he has returned to work as usual. After inspecting the cause of the damage to the plane, it was found that it was due to oil accumulation in the engine, which burned the electric bulb, stopped the power, and affected the entire plane, resulting in the crash.

<p>The Truth About the Mengcheng Drug Manufacturing Case</p>
<h3 id="e70">Key Criminal Chen Zaigong Has Been Escorted to Bengbu, But Li Mingxun Is Still on the Run <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence - The key criminal Chen Zaigong in the case of the evil gentry manufacturing heroin in Mengcheng County, northern Anhui, has been escorted to the Bengbu for interrogation. It has been found that Mengcheng is located in a remote area of northern Anhui, and the people have always been known for their strength. Qing Nian bandit Miao Peilin came from this place. The power of local evil forces has always been strong. The county and the nearby counties of Suhao and others are the most prosperous areas for opium production. Therefore, the spread of opium is even more widespread than in central Anhui. Although the authorities have repeatedly stepped up the ban, it is related to opium seedling tax revenue, and it has been impossible to eradicate it for many years. Li Mingxun, chairman of the Mengcheng County Chamber of Commerce (namely Li Ge), has been domineering in the countryside for a long time, and has been eyed by the people of the county. Li took northern Anhui as a source of opium, and the local price was relatively low. He had a whimsical idea, raised funds to set up an institution, specializing in the purchase of opium and the manufacture of heroin, in order to obtain huge profits. The drug manufacturing institution was secretly borrowed by Li Defa, the owner of the Defa grain store in Hebei, the county, and Zhao Baoyu and Zhao Huairen were responsible for the formulation. It is said that there were also two foreigners inside who served as main technicians. There were many shareholders, including Chen Xiuzhai, Gao Yishan, Wang Huaibao, and Yu Yiting. The car worker Wang Ziqing was solely responsible for transporting the soil. The four technicians mostly manufactured the drug manufacturing institution at night. The drug manufacturing institution was first set up inside the Defa grain store, and then returned to Li Mingxun's home and Chen Zaigong's home to manufacture secretly. The sound of the machine reached the outdoors. Li and others had three specially made double-bottomed boats, specializing in transporting drugs out of the country. Sometimes they loaded wheat on top and drugs underneath, first escorted by Yu Yiting to Bengbu, and then tried to transport them to Shanghai for sale. They made huge profits each time. Since the opening, they have made a profit of more than 100,000 yuan, which has been divided equally among the shareholders according to their shares. In September of this year, Yu transported 84 packages of heroin to Bengbu. The boat was parked on the river, and it was discovered by the military police inspection office of the garrison headquarters. Yu Yiting escaped, and the boatman Xie Kai was captured. At that time, Xie confessed everything, claiming that the drugs were mainly manufactured by Li Mingxun. At that time, the garrison commander Jiang Dingwen reported the news and sent personnel to Mengcheng for secret investigation. Li Mingxun temporarily avoided the wind. Last month, Jiang resigned from his post as garrison commander, and Xu Tingyao, commander of the Fourth Division, was ordered to take over. Mengcheng party members and educators Zhang Dong and Wang Jianhu filed complaints with the National Government, the Anhui Provincial Government, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek then telegraphed Xu Tingyao to investigate. After receiving the order, Xu sent military judge Jin Shuo and 16 soldiers to Mengcheng to arrest the key criminals a few days ago. At that time, Li Mingxun fled again after hearing the news. Chen Zaigong was arrested. At that time, more than a thousand people gathered to intercede, but Jin refused. He handed Chen over to the Mengcheng County Government for detention and ordered him to be escorted to Bengbu for interrogation within five days. County Magistrate Qin Liangzao sent a team on the sixth to escort Chen in a car to Bengbu and handed him over to the military law department of the Fourth Division for custody. On the seventh, Xu Tingyao, together with Wu Baoming, director of the military law department, summoned him for interrogation. According to Chen, he only said that Li Mingxun manufactured heroin, but Li had fled to Anqing, and denied that he participated. After the interrogation, he was returned to the military law department for custody. It is said that he will be retried within days. Xu Tingyao is collecting evidence and has asked the military and political party authorities to issue an order to arrest Li and other criminals and bring them to justice. Chen Zaigong has been accused of many murders in Mengcheng. The family members of the victims, such as the wife of Ruzai, are now in Bengbu and have filed a complaint with the garrison headquarters, requesting that they be punished according to law. However, many Meng gentry have come to Bengbu to run errands for Li and Chen, hoping to ease the atmosphere. It is not known how this case will be resolved. (December 8th)</p>
<p>Jinan Captures Important Communist Party Member</p>
<h3 id="e71">According to the confession, Yao Ce is also an important figure. Therefore, Yao's private car was also inspected. <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>A visitor from Jinan said that at 11:00 p.m. on the 6th, Zhang Cun, director of the Provincial Reorganization Committee, and Wang Kaiyu, director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, led a detective team to the private car of Yao Yijia, a National Government Councilor, at the Jinpu Railway Station to conduct an inspection. It was heard that they were searching for reactionary elements and arrested several people. For a time, many people did not understand the truth. On the 7th, someone visited Zhang Cun to inquire about what was going on. Zhang said:</p>
<p>Because yesterday a special detective team captured a Communist Party member named Zhang Hongli at the Youth Association. The suspect is a graduate of the Moscow Infantry School and has military activities in North China. After being arrested, he confessed that he lived on General Yao's (Yijia) car, and Yao's son, Yao Ce, is also an important figure. Therefore, they went to Yao's car last night to conduct an inspection. Yao Ce was not on the car, but many reactionary publications were found. Later, they went to Yao's house, but Yao Ce was not at home either. They are currently continuing to arrest his accomplices.</p>
<p>The Truth About the Bandit Areas in Western Anhui Counties</p>
<h3 id="e72">Report on the Anqing Inspection Group's Visit to Wuhu <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: After the Central Army routed the Communist bandits in various counties of western Anhui, the Anqing provincial capital's party, government, and various sectors specially organized an inspection group for the bandit areas of western Anhui to inspect the bandit areas of Huoshan, Lu'an, and other counties. They arrived in Wuhu yesterday (the 6th). Today, they convened representatives from party, government, business, and various organizations at the county chamber of commerce to report on the situation they observed in the bandit areas. After an introductory speech by Wang Zuxun, a committee member of the Kuomintang party department, Wang Chun and Wang Zhensheng, representatives of the group, successively reported, stating that the main reasons for this inspection were: 1) to understand the true situation of the disaster in the bandit areas; 2) to widely publicize the situation in the bandit areas to the outside world; 3) to hope that leaders from all walks of life would jointly promote and provide spiritual and material assistance. As for the Communist Party's occupation of western Anhui, there were three reasons: (A) Poor politics: local officials and the self-defense corps abused their power, making the people easily susceptible to the Communist Party's enticements; (B) Cultural backwardness: the people's thinking seemed untouched by the times. For example, they suspected that automobiles were animals and asked how much rice straw they needed to eat each day; (C) Geographical relations: Lu'an and other counties had towering mountains and continuous ranges, allowing bandits such as Little White Wolf and others to occupy the mountains and dominate, harassing the people everywhere, which was then exploited by the Communist bandits. Due to these three major reasons, the people of western Anhui could not avoid this great calamity. However, after the Communist Party occupied western Anhui, they established a fake Soviet government in Zhufushan, Huoshan, and a fake Northwest District in Mapu Town, Lu'an, dividing the entire population into farmers, workers, and merchants. Farmers were further divided into five types: landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, poor peasants, and hired laborers. Merchants were divided into rich merchants, middle merchants, stall vendors, and small merchants. Workers were also categorized based on their circumstances. For example, workers with knowledgeable or wealthy merchant/rich peasant brothers or relatives inevitably faced discrimination. The so-called middle merchants, middle peasants, and intellectuals were all classified as reactionaries and were often in danger of being killed. Near the fake Soviet government in Zhufushan, ninety-six pits were dug, and over 13,000 people were killed. In Mapu, the number of people killed was even higher, reaching over 30,000. The people's minds were even more frighteningly numbed. Even women and children would immediately say, "This is a landlord, that is a middle peasant, they do not comply with our party's discipline and should be eliminated," and so on.</p>
<p>Currently, within the disaster area, aside from the yellow-faced and emaciated survivors, there are only piles of white bones and skulls everywhere. After the bandits left, the people's harvest averaged only four dou of rice per person, and it is estimated that they can barely maintain their livelihood until the end of the year. However, next year's famine in the spring will require external grain relief, and seeds, plows, and agricultural tools have all been completely destroyed and should be provided. Secondly, changing people's thinking and breaking through the Communist Party's remaining organization are urgent tasks. After the group returns to the province, the party will present the situation in the disaster area to the provincial government and the central government, requesting prompt allocation of funds for emergency relief. On the one hand, they will appeal to fellow villagers abroad. Wuhu is the leading commercial area in Anhui province. We respectfully ask all sectors to have compassion, rise up together, and cooperate in providing relief. (7th)</p>
<p>The Lanzhou Water Tobacco Industry Declines Sharply</p>
<h3 id="e73">Stagnant Sales in Shanghai and Tianjin Markets Lead to Continued Closures of Gaolan Tobacco Farmers <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Gaolan Dispatch: The Lanzhou water tobacco industry has gradually declined since the start of the Songhu War due to the loss of sales markets. Yesterday, this reporter met with a gentleman from the water tobacco industry to inquire about the recent situation. According to him, there were very few tobacco planters in Lanzhou this year, and the tobacco industry is even more depressed than in early spring. The reason is that the price of tobacco in Shanghai and Tianjin has plummeted. Last year, it was worth about one and a half taels of silver per catty, but now it has fallen to two fen or one tael, and there are still no buyers. Therefore, the water tobacco transported from Lanzhou to Tianjin and Shanghai last year is now all stockpiled. In previous years, Shanghai tobacco merchants would come to Lanzhou in early summer to order water tobacco, but this year, no one has inquired so far. As a result, very few tobacco farmers are planting, estimated to be less than 50-60% of the past. As for the so-called "Four Great Tobacco Firms" in Lanzhou, they have also suffered greatly due to excessive spending in recent years. Now, the large firms have closed down, and the number of small workshops that have stopped operating is even more uncountable. Therefore, the Lanzhou water tobacco industry is currently in a sharp decline. Although there were discussions about rectification around the beginning of this year, nothing has materialized. If it is delayed further, the Lanzhou tobacco industry will be beyond saving. (December 7th)</p>

<p>(Dragon King Temple Misleads Villagers) The Maota area, bordering Songjiang and Jinshan, is located on the shore of Maohu Lake, about thirty miles from Songjiang City. There is a Dragon King Temple there. In the past, Taibao Ashu looted the entire town of Zhangyan, and the kidnapped victims were brought to this temple to determine the price of their ransom, like a judicial trial. However, last year, rumors suddenly spread that there was an extraordinary monk in the temple, and superstitious people from far and wide hired boats to go there to worship and seek fortune, causing quite a stir. Even people from Suzhou and Wuxi came after hearing the news. The Jinshan County government then sent police to ban it, but the incense remained as strong as ever after the police left. Some boat merchants catered to the psychology of superstitious men and women, even opening special routes to transport them, making a great profit. The county government finally suppressed it severely, burning the wooden idols, and this trend gradually subsided. However, recently, the old habits have resurfaced. It is said that someone with a strange illness was cured by taking medicine from the temple, and this spread throughout the surrounding villages, causing ignorant people to burn incense and pray. The gathering is substantial. It is heard that the authorities will soon ban it to eliminate superstition.</p>

<p>(Yutai Steamer Robbed Midway) Suzhou long-distance telephone dispatch: Yesterday at about 3 PM, the Yutai small steamer of the China Merchants Bureau, sailing from Suzhou to Dongting East Mountain, was attacked when it reached Wangyang, Taihu Lake. Over twenty bandits jumped out of three bandit boats, boarded the steamer, and robbed it. Four passengers were kidnapped, and two passengers were shot dead on the spot. All valuables were looted. A patrol boat of the Eighth Water Police Team followed behind the steamer, providing protection. Upon hearing the alarm, they opened fire to apprehend the bandits, but unfortunately, the bandits outnumbered the police, injuring three policemen. All firearms were also robbed. It is now heard that the Third Water Police District has dispatched a large team to pursue and suppress the bandits.</p>

<p>(Tax Bureau Requests Exemption from Winter Grain Tax) Chen Xiaochu, the director of the Tax Bureau, telegraphed the provincial government yesterday regarding the increased winter grain tax, stating: "Last year's winter grain tax was increased by two yuan per stone, which the people could not afford. I have repeatedly telegraphed to request exemption, but I was informed that due to the urgency of bandit suppression and the lack of funds for the military, this measure was unavoidable, limited to one year. Your consideration of the people's difficulties is greatly appreciated. However, when the second installment of land tax was collected this year, it was still ordered to be increased by two yuan, causing widespread panic and unspeakable hardship. This county has suffered continuous years of famine, and the people are living in poverty. This year, a general reduction of 80% has been approved, but even the regular quota of tax is still difficult to meet. How can there be any surplus to bear the increased grain tax? Xiaochu and others, entrusted by the local elders, dare not remain silent. Therefore, we urgently telegraph, humbly requesting that your department promptly order the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to exempt the increased winter grain tax from collection, to alleviate the people's suffering."</p>

Fusheng immediately went to claim it and learned that his wife had been abducted to Shanghai by Gu Dongjiang, the son of Gutang, and a bamboo craftsman monk, and sold to a pimp named Shi Zhonghe for 150 yuan. Shi then resold her to Fujian as a concubine on the 27th of last month. Fortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's water patrol team intercepted her on a ship, and the case was solved. It is now known that the court has ordered her to be returned to her husband yesterday. On the other hand, Fusheng has reported to the county public security bureau to request that the two abductors be arrested and brought to justice.</p>

He also runs a Shuntai dry goods store in the town. His son, Fukang, is already married, but he is particularly fond of seeking pleasure with women. The number of women in the town who have been defiled by him is unknown. Several years ago, Fukang met Genmei, the daughter of Zhang Renhe from Butang in the same town. They became close and their love reached a boiling point. He then took Genmei as his concubine. However, Fukang's mother was exceptionally fierce and despised Genmei because of her humble background, so she often abused her. Fukang also grew tired of her over time and did not cherish her. Genmei secretly wept in the deep of night. On the 4th of this month, Genmei was scolded by her mother-in-law again for a minor matter. Overcome with resentment, she suddenly had the thought of ending her life. That night, she secretly took raw opium and committed suicide. By the time it was discovered the next morning, she had already died. However, because her family was extremely poor, they were unable to negotiate with the Zou family and had to swallow their anger. It is truly tragic.</p>

<p>(Water Police Steamboat Sunk in Collision) Yang Qingjiu, the captain of the 13th Water Public Security Team stationed in Changshu, was summoned by Shen Weiying, the district director of the 4th district of Suzhou, to Suzhou due to the tight winter defense. He returned to Changshu on the evening of the 7th. When his self-provided Jing'an steamboat sailed to the vicinity of Qingdun Temple in Likou, it was already dark and he could not distinguish directions. At that time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's regular liner, the Jiali, also sailed through the area. Due to the darkness, they could not see each other clearly, resulting in a collision between the two sides. Because the steamboat was weak, it was eventually broken and the entire boat was almost sunk. Fortunately, there was a ferry boat nearby that sailed close to the ship and ferried Captain Yang Qingjiu and others to the shore, saving them from disaster. After a while, the steamboat completely sank to the bottom of the river. Yang et al. then took the China Merchants Bureau's Jiali back to Suzhou. The next morning, he hired laborers in Suzhou and went to Qingdun Temple to salvage the steamboat. He found that most of the machinery was severely damaged. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is responsible for transporting it to Shanghai for repairs and compensation. Captain Yang returned to Changshu on the 8th and then transferred to Tiehengsha to suppress bandits.</p>

They requested that the county promptly arrest the ringleaders and punish them severely, and claiming that these hooligans had also sent people to control the Jiangyin Telegraph Bureau. After receiving the telegram, the Provincial Government telegraphed the county government to investigate and handle the matter. The county government, after receiving the telegram, ordered the Public Security Bureau to handle it. Furthermore, the Chiang Kai-shek's Headquarters of the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui for Bandit Suppression received a letter from the county party department regarding the Chenxing Company's public sale of opium, expressing thorough opposition. It has already been instructed to wait for the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<p>(Sixth District Experiences Repeated Kidnappings) In this county, the atmosphere of banditry in the countryside has become increasingly rampant in the past two months. Kidnappings and robberies are heard every day. The other day (the 5th), eight bandits suddenly came to the home of Xu Yatang, a farmer in Nanyangdang in the Sixth District, and kidnapped his eighteen-year-old daughter, demanding 2,000 yuan for her ransom. That night, over ten bandits came to the Wanzhi area in the same district, kidnapped Yang Lanfang's twenty-two-year-old daughter and Wu Junliang's young grandson, and fled after firing shots.</p>

<p>(Cloth Factory Owner Abducts and Sells Female Worker) In Baota Lane, Zhenjiang, there is a man named Shen Changyuan, who works as a rickshaw puller. His eldest daughter, Xiaomao, is only eighteen years old and works as a yarn-spinning worker at the Guangfeng Cloth Factory in Camel Ridge. The owner of the factory, Liang Yu, saw that the girl was small and beautiful, and had bad intentions. He falsely claimed that there was a motorized cloth factory in Shanghai that needed many female workers and offered better treatment than in Zhenjiang. He asked her to hide it from her parents and go with him. Shen's daughter was young and ignorant and believed him. Liang took her to Shanghai and sold her to a brothel. The girl was chaste and refused to engage in prostitution, so she was severely abused by the madam. The other day, she escaped and took a bus back to Zhenjiang, arriving at the station at 9 PM yesterday. Because she did not know the way, she lingered at the station. The on-duty police officer noticed her and thought she was suspicious, so he took her to the station for questioning. The girl told him the whole story. He immediately summoned Shen Changyuan to identify her. Shen had been anxious since his daughter disappeared and only then did he learn the truth. He took the factory owner Liang Yu to the court to negotiate.</p>

<p>(Election Fraud for Provincial Representatives) The Taixian County Party Department followed the regulations of the provincial and central departments, and each branch set the election dates from the 1st to the 7th and followed the direct election method to elect three provincial representatives. However, recently, a majority of party members discovered that the entire committee of the county party department was participating with non-party members and secretly electing through various fraudulent means. They telegraphed the provincial officials to report and request that the qualifications of the elected representatives be revoked and given appropriate punishment in accordance with Article 18 of the Election Regulations issued by the Central Committee. After receiving the telegram, the Provincial Department appointed supervisor Liu Chengrui to come to Taixian yesterday to conduct a thorough investigation. It is heard that after the investigation, the official believed that the fraud committed by the committee members of the party department was true. He collected all the physical evidence and intends to return to the province to report tomorrow.</p>

He has been sued to the provincial and county courts and construction and civil affairs departments, requesting the recovery of the embezzled funds. The county government immediately ordered the police to arrest and detain him. On one hand, it is clearing the accounts of the collected grass rent to verify the facts and report.</p>

<p>Bai Wenwei and Zhang Zhiben Returned to Shanghai from Guangdong Yesterday Morning</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Content of the Proposal by the Central Committee Members in Guangdong Has Been Decided, and Four Central Committee Members Will Arrive in Shanghai on the 10th. Donations to Support the Volunteer Army are Very Enthusiastic. <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Sun Ke, Li Liejun, and other Central Committee members in Shanghai, considering that the Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee has been scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 15th of this month, have repeatedly consulted on the issues for the proposal. It has been decided to jointly propose it. In order to solicit the opinions of the Central Committee members in Guangdong, Bai Wenwei, Zhang Zhiben, Liu Luyin, Cheng Qian, and other four Central Committee members were selected to travel south to meet with the Guangdong and Hong Kong parties to discuss and plan the methods for supporting the Northeast Volunteer Army and providing relief to the Northeast refugees. Considerable results have been achieved. Therefore, the two Central Committee members, Bai and Zhang, took the Grand President liner yesterday morning and returned to Shanghai first. The Central News Agency reporter met the Grand President when it arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 yesterday morning and asked about their trip to Guangdong and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>According to Bai Wenwei, the task of this trip south was not only to seek the opinions of the Central Committee members in Guangdong on the proposals for the Third Plenary Session, but also to discuss and plan methods for providing relief to the Northeast Volunteer Army and refugees. As for the proposals for the Third Plenary Session, the Central Committee members in Guangdong have decided that the content of the proposal will advocate active resistance against Japan externally and thorough suppression of bandits internally. Japan's advances have reached the point of unbearable tolerance. Although the indignation of the national populace is strong, there has been no concrete method of recovery for the lost Northeast. The past is gone. It is hoped that after the anti-Japanese proposal is passed at the Third Plenary Session, the entire country will actively carry it out. As for the bandit disturbances, they cannot be pacified without thorough suppression, and there will be no peace for the people. Although the bandit forces in various places seem to be weakening now, they cannot eliminate future troubles without fundamental suppression. All the committees in Guangdong, except for Hu Hanmin due to illness and Chen Jitang and others due to official duties, will go to Nanjing to attend. Deng Qingyang and others are already on their way and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th. It has not been decided whether I will attend. As for the loyal and brave Northeast Volunteer Army, they have been fighting bloody battles against Japan for more than a year. Due to the lack of support, they have repeatedly been in danger. This time, we went south and discussed relief methods with the Guangdong authorities. The Guangdong authorities expressed their admiration for the Northeast Volunteer Army's resistance against Japan and their deep sympathy for the Northeast refugees. Therefore, they all expressed that they must provide relief to the greatest extent possible. The Guangdong authorities have agreed to allocate tens of thousands of yuan first and to solicit donations from the public. The people of Guangdong Province are donating very enthusiastically, especially the overseas Chinese who are most enthusiastic. The Guangdong authorities have telegraphed the leaders of the Northeast anti-Japanese resistance, asking them to send personnel to Guangdong as soon as possible to set up an office to facilitate contact for relief matters. Central Committee member Cheng Qian has scheduled to go to Southeast Asia in the next few days to solicit donations from overseas Chinese in various places, so the date of his return to Shanghai cannot be determined. As for Liu Luyin, he will return to Shanghai a few days later because he still has unfinished business. Since the September 18th Incident, all parts of Guangdong Province have been actively boycotting Japanese goods. Therefore, Japanese goods have disappeared within Guangdong Province. The excellence of the results is incomparable to Shanghai. During my stay in Guangdong for several days, I only saw one Japanese woman along the way. This alone is enough to prove that Guangdong Province's anti-Japanese achievements are better than other places. Bai also said that Guangdong Province's monthly income is 11 million yuan, so the various local constructions are becoming more and more complete.</p>
<p>According to Zhang Zhiben, Guangdong Province's anti-Japanese enthusiasm is increasing day by day, so there are complete methods for assisting the Northeast Volunteer Army. It is hoped that the anti-Japanese resolution will be passed in the Third Plenary Session and efforts will be made to implement it. It has not yet been decided whether I will attend the Third Plenary Session.</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo's Speech</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Central Government System Will Not Be Changed <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at about 8 AM yesterday. Chen talked in detail with the Central News Agency reporter about the Third Plenary Session and the steel plant and Construction Bank sponsored by the Ministry of Industry. They are described below.</p>
<p>(No Major Changes to the Central Government System) Chen told the reporter that the Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee will open on the 15th of this month. According to precedent, the first two days will be preliminary meetings to organize the review committee and group committees to organize the proposals, which will then be submitted to the general meeting for discussion. Director Wang has no opinion on the National Participation Affairs, and it is feared that this case will not be submitted to the general meeting for discussion. As for the organization of the National Government, there may be some changes, but there will be no major changes because the national crisis is urgent and most Central Committee members do not advocate changes, so this issue does not need to be considered at the general meeting. Although there are various rumors about the merger of the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications, it has not been decided yet.</p>
<p>(Fishery Tax Will Be Exempted to Protect the Fishery Industry) The Ministry of Industry has considered the request of fishermen in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to exempt the fishery tax to protect the fishery industry and may approve it. However, because China's coastal fisheries are hampered by crude fishing gear, they have been heavily encroached upon by the Japanese, resulting in huge losses of benefits. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry has formulated an entire fishery plan, advocating the establishment of more fishery associations and other institutions beneficial to fishermen to provide guidance and seek improvement. This plan will be discussed at the upcoming National Fishery and Salt Conference. Although the fishery tax may be reduced or exempted, a new tax may be levied to develop the fishery industry. In short, the principle is to take from the fishery and use it for the fishery. As for the matter of my concurrently serving as the director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Bureau, it has not been decided yet.</p>
<p>(Steel Plant Contract Still Awaits Signature) The steel plant contract is still being investigated regarding the quality and quantity of the coal reserves in Leijiagou, and it will take some time before it is signed. As for the Construction Bank, it is actively proceeding. I have no important task in coming to Shanghai and must return to Nanjing within two or three days.</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang Denies Moving to Datong</p>
<h3 id="e91">Says He is Very Comfortable Living in Zhangjiakou <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang telegraphed on the 7th: "I recently read in various newspapers that Lu Zhonglin, Sun Liangcheng, Pang Bingxun, etc., in order to dispel rumors, intend to ask Feng to move to Datong and have obtained Feng's consent. After reading it, I was very surprised. I have been in Zhangjiakou for more than a month and have not communicated with the above people, nor has the matter been reported. It is truly a rumor from an empty valley. Obviously, shameless people are being instructed to deliberately create rumors to mislead the public. I am very comfortable living here, and it is not as the newspapers say. I am afraid that the truth is not clear, so I make a special declaration on the right, Feng Yuxiang Yang."</p>
<h3 id="e92">Song Ziwen Flew to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance and acting President of the Executive Yuan, flew from Nanjing to Shanghai with Huang Chundao, the secretary of the Ministry of Finance, at about 11 AM yesterday, arriving here at 12:30 PM at noon and returning to his residence to rest at 1 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>It is Said That the Agreement Between the Courts of the Two Concessions Has Been Extended for Three Years</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Countries Concerned Have Not Yet Reached a Decision <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News said: "Regarding the proposal to extend the agreement between the local and higher courts of the two concessions in Shanghai for three years, this newspaper has learned from reliable sources that this proposal was made by the Chinese side. Representatives of the Chinese government have consulted once with representatives of the countries concerned stationed in China, but no decision has been reached at this time because the countries concerned have not yet made a final decision. It is heard that the British representative has indicated the need to seek instructions from his home government."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times said: "Regarding the claim that the Chinese authorities have agreed to extend the agreement between the courts of the two concessions, a spokesman for U.S. Consul General Cunningham recently stated that Mr. Cunningham has not heard that this matter has been decided."</p>
<h3 id="e94">Statement from the United Anti-Japanese Armies Joint Communications Office: Ma Zhanshan Has Not Retreated into Russian Territory <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from the East China News Agency reports that the Joint Communications Office of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies stationed in Shanghai issued an important statement yesterday, saying that the Japanese side has been spreading rumors daily that General Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen have both entered Russian territory. However, today, this office received a telegram from General Ma forwarded from Beiping. Investigations revealed that Su Bingwen withdrew from the country on the fourth day, and General Ma's garrison location is far from Haiman and other places, definitely not reachable in a few days. Therefore, Ma's retreat into Russia is absolutely not true. As for the contents of the telegram, it is inconvenient to disclose them due to various reasons.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Will Refer the Jin Che Case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<h3 id="e95">Due to the Japanese Consul's Reply to the Protest, Not Acknowledging Jin as a Chinese National <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government previously protested to both the French and Japanese consulates regarding the Japanese consulate's dispatch of police to the French Concession to arrest Jin Che, a naturalized Korean. The Japanese side has now replied to the Municipal Government, stating that they recognize Jin as a Korean national. The Municipal Government will refer this matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for handling. As Huang Zhanying may appear, the secret facts related to this case involving Ji Zhuqing will be temporarily withheld from publication. Details of the situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>(Content of the Reply) According to a statement from a person in charge of the Municipal Government, the Japanese side has sent a reply to the protest letter regarding the unauthorized arrest of Jin Che. The content of the reply indicates that they do not recognize Jin Che as a naturalized Chinese national. The reason they hold this view is that the Municipal Government considers Jin et al. to be Chinese citizens because they hold Naturalization Certificates No. 67 from the Ministry of Interior of the Chinese National Government. However, according to Japanese law, anyone who naturalizes in another country must first obtain permission from the Japanese government to renounce Japanese nationality before their acquired nationality is valid. An investigation reveals that Jin et al. did not obtain permission from the Japanese government, so their acquired Chinese nationality is invalid. The Japanese side still recognizes Jin et al. as Korean residents.</p>
<p>(Referral to the Ministry) A person in charge of the Municipal Government told the New Voice News Agency yesterday morning that the Japanese reply is not in accordance with international law. Since the Japanese side does not recognize Jin's Chinese nationality, Jin's international status becomes one of dual nationality. According to international law, in the event of a dispute involving a person with dual nationality, the nationality of the country where the person is located should be handled. Therefore, in this case, Jin Che is a person with dual nationality, and the Japanese side's unauthorized arrest is unreasonable. Therefore, the Municipal Government will refer this matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for legal handling, as it falls under the purview of diplomatic affairs. As for the protest lodged with the French Consulate, the Japanese Consulate has returned the property after Jin Che was released, so the responsibility of the French side seems to be complete.</p>
<p>(Huang Zhanying's Letter) At 4:00 PM on the ninth day, in addition to receiving a letter from Wu Chengyu, Ji Zhuqing received another letter. Upon opening it, he realized it was from Huang Zhanying. He urgently asked where the messenger was, but they had already left. The original letter was very long, mainly stating that he was truly wronged and requested redress. At the end of the letter, he wrote, "The letter that your brother sent to Mr. Zhao was sent by registered mail. The return address is your brother's place. However, I did not obtain your consent beforehand. Please forgive your brother's presumption. Only you can save my life, and only you can redress my grievance. I hope you will redress it for me. I am extremely grateful and await your orders."</p>
<p>(Ji Zhuqing's Letter) After receiving the letter, Ji Zhuqing sent a special letter to various newspapers for publication, as follows: New Voice News Agency to all newspapers, please publish in the letter column: Brother Huang Zhanying, although we met through Wu Chengyu's introduction, our relationship is very good. If we do not clarify the situation at this critical juncture of life and death, it would be suicide for both the country and ourselves. This case has been going on for nine days. Why hasn't Mr. Huang come forward to surrender? Since you have been wronged, you should have explained it earlier. Why are you so foolish? If the evidence is solid, the people will have their own opinion, and I alone cannot do anything. If Mr. Huang unfortunately passes away at this time, wouldn't it be a wrongful death in the afterlife? If Mr. Huang is really sick and has no money for treatment, I will be responsible for the medical expenses. I hope you will come forward immediately, or let me know your location. I eagerly await your reply. Also, to the editors of various newspapers, regarding the Wu Chengyu and Huang Zhanying incident, before the truth is revealed, please publish both sides' statements equally to allow the public to make a fair judgment. I have been a friend of Wu Chengyu for many years and have no personal grudges. This negotiation is entirely for the public good. Who is right and who is wrong will be determined. If Mr. Wu is indeed innocent, I will apologize with a cane on my back. I will not break my word. I hereby inform you. Best wishes.</p>
<p>Indignation of Customs Officials Regarding Ernst's Actions</p>
<h3 id="e96">Calling for the Recovery of His Pension and Requesting the Government to Issue an Arrest Warrant <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported the previous day that Ernst (a Briton), the former Acting Inspector General of Customs, is now employed as a customs advisor to the puppet Manchurian regime and will be appointed as the Inspector General of Customs for the puppet state. This newspaper's reporter went to the Inspectorate General of Customs to inquire whether this was true. A certain gentleman, an important official of the Inspectorate General, made the following statement: The gentleman said that after this news was revealed, the Inspectorate General of Customs was shocked. Ernst served in the Chinese Customs for more than 20 years. In 1928, he was appointed as Acting Inspector General of Customs by the National Government. Later, he resigned voluntarily due to personal reasons. The government, out of respect, issued a full pension of 9,000 pounds. China's treatment of Ernst can be said to be extremely generous. Now, Ernst has forgotten the grace of eating Chinese salaries for decades and willingly becomes an official of China's enemy. His lack of conscience is extreme. The pension is given for the lifelong support of retired personnel, so even though the person who has received the pension is no longer in office, he can still be said to be eating Chinese salaries. How can a person who eats Chinese salaries betray China? Where is his conscience? It is hoped that the government can immediately order the recovery of Ernst's pension and issue an arrest warrant to serve as a warning to foreigners who are untrustworthy and unrighteous.</p>
<p>There Is No Tax on Foreign Rice</p>
<h3 id="e97">Song Ziwen Telegraphed Wang Xiaolai Denying It <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Reports state that Guangzhou is opposing the tax on foreign rice, and grain merchants are hoarding large quantities of foreign rice in protest. It is said that Finance Minister Song Ziwen attaches great importance to this matter. He telegraphed Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, yesterday, stating that it was not true and asking him to telegraph Guangzhou to dispel the rumors. It is said that Wang sent a telegram to Guangzhou yesterday. The original telegram stated: To the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, reports state that you are opposing the tax on foreign rice and that grain merchants are hoarding large quantities of foreign rice. An investigation reveals that there is no tax on foreign rice. Please inform all industries not to believe the rumors. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. Wen Yinxing, the former Director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, was dispatched to Hong Kong by Foreign Minister Luo Wengan after his resignation to handle consular visa procedures. He has now completed the task and arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday on the Granton Wheel. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with Mr. Wen on the ship yesterday. According to him, the consular visa service in Hong Kong could be opened in ten days or so. Now, it has been handled properly. He was only ordered to open the service, so he handed it over to others to take over and left Hong Kong by ship. He is now briefly staying in Shanghai and will go to Beijing next Monday to report to Foreign Minister Luo about the opening situation.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Records of the Inspection of the Completed Dike Construction by the National Government Flood Relief Committee (12) <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>(Lunch at Wuhan University) The inspection team was originally scheduled to go to Qingshan, Wuchang, on the morning of the fourth to inspect the Wuhui Dike. Due to rain and strong winds, the ferry was inconvenient, so the trip was temporarily canceled. At noon, the team accepted an invitation from the Hubei Provincial Government to visit the new campus of Wuhan University on Luojia Mountain and had lunch at Wuhan University. At 12:00, all the members of the team took cars from several shops on Yangzi River to the Jianghanguan Wharf, took the Jianwu ferry across the river to Wuchang. The Provincial Government had five cars ready at the Hanyang Wharf, and they took them to Luojia Mountain, arriving in about 40 minutes. Luojia Mountain is located in the eastern suburbs of Wuchang and has excellent scenery. The new campus of Wuhan University is built on the mountainside in a palace-style architecture. From a distance, the green tiles and yellow walls surrounding the green mountains are exceptionally beautiful. After entering, they were guided by the Provincial Government and Xiong Guozhao, the director of Wuhan University's affairs, to the meeting room to rest. From the window, you could see East Lake, the lake water was green, and the trees were lush, as if you were in a painting. Then, they visited the library, science museum, auditorium, dining room, and other places. In front of the school is a very large square with complete sports facilities. At that time, the Provincial Government had prepared a simple meal in the Wuhan University cafeteria, and they took their seats for lunch. At about 2:00 PM, each team member left the school, crossed the river, and returned to Hankou.</p>
<p>(Tea Party at the Commander-in-Chief's Office) At 4:00 PM on the fourth, Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Banditry Campaign in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces, held a tea party on the second floor of the Jin Cheng Bank to entertain the Dike Construction Inspection Team and the visiting delegations from Nanjing and Beiping to the recovered bandit areas. More than a hundred Chinese and foreign guests attended. Chen Xiyi and other deputy directors of the General Headquarters' Adjutant Office were responsible for the reception. Xia Doyin, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, the commissioners and directors of various provinces, and military commanders were invited to accompany them. Simpson, Vice-Chairman of the Flood Relief Committee, also arrived from Wuhu to participate. At 4:20 PM, Commander-in-Chief Chiang and his wife, Madame Soong Mei-ling, arrived. Chiang, wearing a Chinese-style jacket and cotton robe, was full of energy and delivered a welcoming speech, stating briefly that he was very pleased to gather with the Chinese and foreign members of the Dike Construction Inspection Team and the Bandit Area Inspection Team during this time of national crisis and bandit suppression. He hoped that everyone would offer their guidance and opinions, and he would accept them sincerely. He had prepared refreshments to express his welcome and gratitude to those who had traveled a long way to inspect.</p>
<p>Surplus Jiangxi Rice Is Transported to Guangdong for Sale</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Only Good Way to Relieve Jiangxi Farmers <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The farmland in the provinces along the Yangtze River has had a bumper harvest this year. Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui have mostly had ten-year-old yields. The price of Xiang and Gan rice has fallen to 2.5 to 2.6 yuan per stone. Hunan initially planned to relax the ban on 2 million stone, but the heavy donations and taxes exceeded the value of the rice, resulting in purchasers being insufficient. The same is true in Jiangxi. Now, Jiangxi farmers have too much rice stockpiled and cannot sell it for a while. Even if they sell it at a lower price, few people ask about it, resulting in a situation where grain is cheap and farmers are harmed, and the countryside goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>(The Provincial Government Seeks Relief) The Jiangxi Provincial Government, in view of the excessive stockpiles of grain,</p>
<p>and the abundant harvests in many places, and because Shanghai rice merchants have stopped purchasing due to the import of foreign rice and wheat, is seeking other ways to save the situation. Since the coastal provinces in South China have a huge demand for rice each year, millions of stone of Anhui rice have been gathered in Guangdong Province. Jiangxi Province has also decided to follow suit. The Provincial Government will initiate and organize a large-scale transportation and sales cooperative to connect leaders from all walks of life in the province to handle Jiangxi rice exports, tentatively set at 1 million stone, to be sold to Guangdong first. With the consent of Chairman Xiong Shihui, personnel have been sent to Guangdong to contact grain merchants and reach an agreement. At the same time, donations and taxes will be reduced to quickly sell out the province's stockpiled rice, thereby relieving the farmers. The cooperative has been established and has begun to rent ships to transport rice.</p>
<p>(Telegraph Rental of Ocean Liners to Transport to Guangdong) With the Provincial Government leading the export of Jiangxi rice, it is easy to achieve success. Chairman Xiong telegraphed Shanghai to contact Yu Qiaqing of the Sanbei Company to rent ships. The telegram stated: Jiangxi has too much rice stockpiled, and the countryside is in decline. The Provincial Government has now contacted all sectors to organize a large-scale transportation and sales cooperative to relieve the farmers in the province and sell the surplus grain. We plan to transport rice to Guangdong. Everything has been negotiated. We intend to rent ocean liners from your company to load and transport the rice. Please provide a special low price for the ship and water feet and telegraph us immediately so that we can rent the ships and go to Jiujiang to load and transport to Guangdong. Yu has agreed to rent the ships at a low price to facilitate the people's food supply and has telegraphed Chairman Xiong to prepare to release the ships for loading and transportation.</p>

<p>(Xu Shiying's Reply) Xu Shiying was then publicly recommended by the Dike Construction Inspection Team to deliver a thank-you speech. He briefly stated, "Commander-in-Chief, military commanders, administrative officials, guests, and colleagues, we are here in Hankou to participate in the dike construction inspection and are deeply grateful for the Commander-in-Chief's grand reception and encouragement. Last year's floods caused the dikes in the Jiang, Huai, and Han rivers to be almost completely destroyed. The losses suffered by the three towns of Wuhan were particularly severe. Everyone present knows this. After the floods, the government immediately sent people to handle relief, epidemic prevention, and sanitation work. At the same time, the National Government Flood Relief Committee was specially organized, with Director Song serving as the chairman, and various departments were set up to handle relief work. The personnel in charge of dike construction have always been exceptionally diligent. Now, all the dike projects in the Jiang, Huai, and Han rivers have been completed. Although we only saw a part of the dike construction during this inspection along the river, the general consensus is that the dike construction is extremely solid. There has been a lot of rain this summer, but the highest water level is still one or two meters away from the dike surface. The fields along the river have been well protected, and as a result, none of them have been flooded. This autumn, the harvest is very abundant, and the people are grateful for the government's grace. As a member of the inspection team, I believe that the dike construction was able to achieve such a great and remarkable project in the shortest time with the most economical plan, which is truly admirable. After passing through the four provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei, the economy of the rural areas along the river has indeed recovered a lot compared to last year. The internal banditry has been largely stabilized after several months of suppression by the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Regarding this point, we especially admire the Commander-in-Chief's virtue and his spirit of perseverance and the efforts of the military and political leaders present. Since we want to comfort our compatriots in these recovered disaster areas, after receiving the Commander-in-Chief's telegram on the 30th, people from all walks of life in Shanghai, such as Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Du Pengsheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Ye Juhu, Zheng Shaojue, Chen Aishi, Wang Rutang, Wu Zhihao, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, and Zhao Jinqing, Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai, and Mr. Wen Lantin, Li Zushen, and Sun Chunqi, immediately organized a Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Charity Association to raise relief funds. They are all very enthusiastic, so we have made considerable preparations in terms of relief funds. Before we departed from Shanghai, the association invited many leaders to come to Hankou to express our gratitude to the Commander-in-Chief before visiting various places. The representatives elected by various groups could not come due to time constraints, but they may come later. When we return to Shanghai, we will certainly make extra efforts to raise funds for those disaster victims. This is our bounden duty, and only in this way can we live up to the efforts of the Commander-in-Chief and the military and political leaders present. We should each fulfill our responsibilities. Today, we are grateful for the Commander-in-Chief's reception. On behalf of everyone who has come, I express our sincere gratitude and wish the Commander-in-Chief and his wife good health. Xu Shiying finished his speech.</p>

It will be very effective for suppressing bandits and patrolling. As for the position of captain, it is said that the Navy Ministry has internally appointed Lai Rumei.

<p>The International Problems Research Association, in view of the forced withdrawal of General Su Bingwen from Heilongjiang Province and the increasingly serious situation, convened a meeting of all members at the Bank Club yesterday. First, Mr. Nylas, a Russian and former secretary of the Board of Directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway, gave a speech detailing the history of the Eastern Railway and the current situation of Russians in Manchuria. Then, Mr. Chen Zongcheng, Director of the International Labor Bureau, reported on his observations on the Sino-Japanese issue in Geneva. He stated that after the Sino-Japanese issue was submitted to the League of Nations, if the member states had initially not made sufficiently fair claims, how did public opinion in various countries change after the 19th Route Army actively resisted? The key to this is worth pondering. It is known that in order to achieve diplomatic victory, one must first make practical efforts on one's own. Then, the members discussed in succession for a long time before adjourning the meeting.</p>
<p>Cao Fengchun, Representative of the Righteous Army in Western Liaoning, Writes to Request Assistance</p>
<h3 id="e103">Righteous Soldiers Still Wear Single Layers in the Freezing Cold <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Cao Fengchun, the Shanghai representative of Geng Jizhou, Commander-in-Chief of the Righteous Army in Western Liaoning, wrote to the Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Righteous Army Support Association yesterday to request relief. The original letter stated: Sir, unfortunately, on the night of September 18 last year, Japanese imperialism suddenly attacked the three northeastern provinces. The border defense officers were unprepared in advance and adhered to a policy of non-resistance afterward. The people of Northeast China, unwilling to see their country broken apart, would rather die resisting than be cowardly subjects of a subjugated nation. They successively organized righteous armies and fought to the death with the Japanese invaders. Our army has fought for a year in hundreds of battles, large and small. Although we cannot drive the enemy out of the country, we can make the Japanese bandits exhausted. However, the reason why we cannot recover lost territory is not because our soldiers are not brave, but because of the lack of food and ammunition. Sincerely, I came south to request that all sectors give our army practical assistance to kill the enemy. Since arriving in Shanghai, it has been more than two months. Although I have tried my best to run around and have shouted myself hoarse, the only assistance I have received is 347 sets of cotton clothing from the Righteous Army Support Association. It is a drop in the bucket. The suffering on the front lines is truly indescribable. At this time, it is already freezing cold outside, and the righteous soldiers who are fighting bloody battles are still wearing single layers. Now, I am glad to hear that the gentlemen of your association are deeply concerned about the situation in the Northeast. It is likely that the suffering of our fighting righteous soldiers can be slightly relieved. I have learned that Fudan University has donated more than 1,000 sets of cotton clothing to your association. I am writing to you specifically to ask that your association immediately give it to our army. I will immediately transport it to the front lines to strengthen our army. I also request assistance. I urgently submit my request and await your reply.</p>

<p>Recent Reports on the Establishment of a Bill Clearing House by the Banking Sector</p>
<h3 id="e109">Can Save Exchange Procedures, Location in the Banking Association <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The banking sector in this city, feeling the troublesome and laborious back-and-forth procedures of bill exchange, has referred to the practices of various European and Western countries to organize a bill clearing house. The clearing house has decided to be established in January next year. The various news about the clearing house is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Motivation for Organization <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, bill clearing houses have long been established in various Western countries. The banking industry in our country is not yet fully developed, so it is still lacking. In fact, this is an indispensable organization. Because there are quite a few banks in Shanghai, each bank issues checks, drafts, etc., and each bank receives many banknotes from other banks every day. If these banknotes are instructed to be exchanged at each bank, then the back-and-forth movement will be overwhelmed. Therefore, a bill clearing house is organized, and each bank sends personnel to the office to exchange and offset the immediate bills received, saving the journey and time. Its convenience need not be repeated.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Location Issues <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The clearing house is jointly organized by the Bank Association's United Reserve Division. Before the bank's construction of the clubhouse, the affiliated sites, such as the bank club and the foundation committee, were within the plan. The location of the bill clearing house was also in the plan. The association has surplus housing, so the location is also in the bank club.</p>
<h3 id="e112">To Be Established Next Month <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>As for the establishment date, it could have been done sooner. However, due to the current year-end season and the heavy workload of account settlement and liquidation for various banks, it has to be slightly delayed. It is expected to be established around January of next year (i.e., next month). Because the organizational procedures are simple, the banks that have currently joined the association include China Bank, Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China Industrial Bank, China Reclamation Bank, Commercial Bank, Central China Bank, China National Encouragement Bank, and dozens of others.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Municipal Police Bureau Re-investigates Household Registration <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The household registration investigation in this city has recently been re-investigated by various district offices in sections. They are paying particular attention to the increase or decrease of households, as well as the entry and exit of maids and servants. With the year-end approaching, this is to prevent petty thieves from taking the opportunity to steal. However, many residents often neglect to report the employment of maids in their homes, resulting in fines of five or ten yuan being discovered by various districts. This has been frequently heard lately, and it is hoped that residents in the South City will pay attention to it.</p>

<p>Kidnappers Fail to Abduct, Victim Fang Jinhong Shot</p>
<h3 id="e121">Fang Jinhong Shot After Getting Off Tram, Ambushed by Kidnappers Who Swarmed Forward, Passerby Approached, Fang Shouted Kidnapping, Though Abducted, Vital Parts Shot <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>At around 8 PM last night, an attempted kidnapping occurred near Huahua Middle School on Yu Garden Road in the West District of Shanghai. The victim, Fang Jinhong, was shot in the chest and his life is in danger. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Getting Off the Tram Not Far From Home - Fang Jinhong, a Cantonese man, 57 years old, resides at No. 26 Hengchang Lane, Yu Garden Road, and works at Sincere Company. Yesterday evening at 7:30 PM, he finished work and returned home, taking Tram Route 1 to Jing'an Temple Station, then transferring to Trolleybus Route 20. In an instant, the trolleybus arrived at the lane entrance of Huahua Middle School and stopped. Fang slowly got off the bus, just a hundred steps from Hengchang Lane.</p>
<p>Refused to Get On The Car - After walking a few steps, he noticed a white-plated car parked on the side of the road, with Municipal registration number 4505 and Concession registration number 17579. Four robbers jumped out of the car. Upon seeing Fang Jinhong, they immediately shoved him into the car. Only then did Fang realize he was being kidnapped and refused to get in at all costs. While they were struggling, several pedestrians approached. Fang then shouted "Kidnapping!" The robbers, feeling guilty, fired several shots, one of which hit Fang in the chest. Bleeding profusely, he fell to the ground. The robbers then fled in the car. After the Jing'an Temple Police Department heard the alarm, they dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives in shifts to rush to the scene. Unfortunately, the robbers had already gone far away. They could only send the injured man to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Details of the Robbers' Car Rental - The car with number 17579 belongs to the Tiantian Car Rental Company on Baker Road. At around 7 PM, a customer claiming to be surnamed Zhou came to rent a car to pick up a patient at Yidingpan Road and take them to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The bookkeeper ordered a driver to drive to the entrance of Yu Garden Road, where three people waiting there waved to stop the car and all got into the car. Not more than a few minutes later, seeing that the place was desolate, they ordered the car to stop, jumped out of three people, pushed the driver out, and three men out of the guns to monitor them, and one bandit then drove full power forward. More than half an hour later, the driver released the driver. The driver turned back and invested in the Jing'an Temple Police Department to report it, and ordered detectives to take a car to catch up.

<h3 id="e122">Newspaper Publication Is Based on Submitted Articles, Newspaper Is the Voice of the Public <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Tieying, the editor of the Taicang Moye Daily, was sued by Hu Jiacong, the director of the business tax bureau, to the Taicang County Government for publishing satirical articles about the illegal collection of business tax. Zhao Enju, the county magistrate, arrested him, sentenced him to one year in prison, fined him, and closed the newspaper. Zhu refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Shanghai District Court. Yesterday, the criminal court judge Qian Chengjun, along with judges Shen Youqi and Guan Liting, held a continued hearing. According to the official report submitted by Hu Jiacong, the provincial government issued an order to urge the collection of taxes before August 19, and received the exemption order on the 26th. According to the tax collection investigator, Zhu Jungang, he received a small amount in Shuangfeng Town on September 17, but later failed to collect any more. Therefore, he and four others made an official report. This report was done by phone, so they reported the facts. Qian Tiemin testified that the merchants in Shuangfeng refused to pay because of the newspaper report that they were stealing chickens, and they could not collect taxes elsewhere. Therefore, they delayed the report until the 26th, and on the afternoon of the 26th, they received the exemption order from the bureau while they were outside. Zhu Tieying testified that the publication was based on submitted articles, and the provincial government gazette of August 10 stated that the 518th meeting decided to exempt the counties of Tai, Jia, and Bao separately. As for why it was not corrected, it was corrected on the 23rd, and the provincial government also announced the method, so there was no need to correct it, and presented two copies of the gazette as evidence. At this point, the official requested the prosecutor Yang Qi to present his opinion, and then the defendant's lawyer defended, mainly arguing that the newspaper's mission is to be the voice of the public and has the responsibility to supervise the government. Now that the exemption order has been issued, there is no crime of harming the country. The government is composed of the people, and the interests of the people are the interests of the country. Please declare innocence. The official announced the end of the debate, and the verdict will be announced on the 15th.</p>
<p>Pitiful Orphan Girl Tricked Into Signing a Contract to Sell Herself</p>
<h3 id="e123">After Falling Into a Brothel, She Suffered Hardship and Only Recently Escaped to Seek Legal Relief <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Chen Sanyuan, a 19-year-old woman from Nanxun, Huzhou, lived in the Dongxi area of Nanxun. Her father, Chen Rusong, previously worked in Shanghai. Sanyuan's mother died when she was 15. Because she had no uncles or brothers to take care of her, her father brought her to Shanghai at the age of 15 and entrusted her to the care of his fellow villager, Zhou Baoguang. Zhou was a businessman at a gold exchange and lived at No. 14 Fuxi Lane, Changde Road, Xinzha. Sanyuan lived in Zhou's house for about three or four months, also working as a servant and serving Zhou's concubine, Zhou Huiying. Soon after, Zhou Baoxian also passed away. At this point, Zhou's concubine, Huiying, seeing that Sanyuan had no family and was lonely and vulnerable, on the fourth day of the fourth lunar month of last year, under the pretext of introducing Sanyuan to work as a helper at the chicken brothel run by Chen Laowu at No. 38 Yiye Lane, Geler Road, French Concession, secretly negotiated to sell Sanyuan to Chen Laowu as a prostitute, using Sanyuan's own name to draw up a contract of sale and inducing Sanyuan to sign and fingerprint it. At that time, Sanyuan was deceived and did not know the scheme, resulting in her falling into a brothel and unable to resist. From then on, Chen Laowu sent people to follow Sanyuan out to make a living by selling laughter every night, or to pick up guests at amusement parks. If she didn't comply, she would be beaten. Her physical freedom was completely stripped away. Sanyuan, unable to bear the suffering, repeatedly tried to escape, but ultimately had no chance. After enduring hardship, she finally managed to escape recently because Chen Laowu was ill and the guards were lax, breaking free from her life of misery. She went to lawyers Ma Junshuo and Li Caixia, requesting legal relief. Ma and Li, as the lawyers, sent a letter to Chen Laowu, instructing him to revoke Chen Sanyuan's contract. Chen Laowu then hired lawyer Liu Hongxun as a representative, giving a vague reply. Sanyuan, seeing Chen Laowu's ambiguity and secretly feeling that someone was following and tracking her, believed that unless it was resolved by law, it would inevitably cause harm. Therefore, she requested Ma and Li to file a lawsuit against Chen Laowu and Zhou Hui in the Civil Court of the Second Special District, requesting confirmation that the contract held by Chen Laowu was invalid (the complaint is omitted). Upon receiving the complaint, the court summoned the parties to a civil trial in the Fourth Division yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Li Shouyi. The plaintiff and the lawyer were present, but the defendants were not present because the bailiff had gone to serve the summons but found that they had moved their residence. According to the plaintiff's statement, since the defendants were not present, the court could not proceed with the trial, and it was decided to wait for public notice before scheduling another hearing, and then adjourned.</p>

<p>Since the preparation of the National Artists Donation Works Exhibition for the Northeast Volunteer Army, various places have been stirred up and telegraphed their support. The Qingdao Cooperative Art Society is scheduled to transport various works to Shanghai before the 25th of this month. Chen Yuncheng and other famous painters from Xuzhou have already sent many pieces. Cheng Bogao, a great historian from this city, donated more than a dozen painted screen strips and fans. Jiang Yinan's parents also donated many landscape and flower paintings. Zhang Jingsan, at the age of seventy, personally wrote a long song to raise funds, with dozens of words, and supported by a cane, sent four calligraphy screens to the association's office on Weihaiwei Road. He was received by Hu Zushun, the executive director, and discussed the arduous struggle of the Northeast Volunteer Army, with full of indignation, which was awe-inspiring. According to Hu, the association's solicitation of works is not limited to ancient and modern calligraphy and paintings, but also includes photography, Hunan embroidery, Gu embroidery, Wenzhou carvings, and other handicrafts and art works. A large-scale exhibition will be held in Shanghai on New Year's Day next year, on the one hand to stimulate the patriotism of the people across the country and rally behind the Northeast Volunteer Army, and on the other hand to collect the essence of national art to promote the revival of our country's inherent culture. Its significance is very important. Therefore, yesterday, a letter was sent to Hu Shuhua, the president of Hunan University, requesting Hunan embroidery, and a letter was sent to the Chinese Society of this city, requesting assistance in the field of fine art photography. At the same time, Executive Director Yin Zhufu contacted the Wenzhou Fellow Villagers Association to solicit Wenzhou carvings.</p>
<p>The Public Concession Will Reassess Land Values</p>
<h3 id="e126">To Be Implemented From July of Next Year <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council's meeting on the 7th of this month adopted the Finance Committee's recommendation to undertake a reassessment of land values, so that the new land values can be implemented from July 1 of next year. According to this recommendation, the Finance Committee proposed it in a report at a meeting on the 2nd of this month, with the approval of the acting director of the Public Works Department and the acting director of the Accounting Department. After discussion by the committee members, they all agreed that the general land prices at this time were higher than the original estimated prices, so it would be fair to slightly increase the taxes borne by the landowners. Therefore, it was decided to recommend it to the Board of Directors, and it was approved by the Board of Directors on the 7th. The current valuation of the Public Concession was estimated in the summer of 1930 and implemented on January 1, 1931. This spring, Western taxpayers authorized the Municipal Council to reassess the land values, but it was postponed due to the tense situation in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Hydrographic Office issued a special announcement yesterday, stating that in the Yangtze River channel, at the location of the Yuanyuan Sha Light Buoy, approximately at 121 degrees 42 minutes East longitude and 42 degrees 19 minutes North latitude,</p>
<p>Recently, a large sand boat sank due to an accident, blocking the river. At low tide, the three masts of the sand boat are still exposed above the river surface. This area is an important waterway for river steamers. Special notification is given to all ships to pay attention to avoid accidents.</p>
<p>Multiple Fishing Boats Robbed</p>

<p>Every time fishing boats set off on the coasts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, they have always donated marine protection fees and requested the Fisheries Administration Bureau to send marine protection ships to escort them. Recently, pirates have been rampant, and the bureau has repeatedly received requests from fishermen to send ships, but it has not been implemented, resulting in four boats, including Zheng Axiang, Xin Ahai, Shi Jihua, and Xu Aben, being robbed in the waters of Shengshan on the 27th of last month. On the 5th of this month, five boats, including Xu Jicai, Shi Jifa, Wang Ruiyun, and Zheng Xiaoju, were also robbed in the waters of Shuizi. Yesterday, fishing boats such as Wang Xingji and Xin Xiaogen were also robbed one after another, with a total loss of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. The unverified losses are countless. Those who have not been robbed are also in imminent danger, which seriously affects the fishing season. If the bureau does not seek remedies urgently, the various fishery guilds will sue to the court.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Federation received a joint letter from the 18th and 26th sub-federations stating that they were shocked to find patriotic lottery tickets on the market recently. According to the regulations, lottery tickets are a disguised form of lotteries, and the method is the same as that of lotteries. Everyone knows the harm of lotteries. Since they were banned in May 1927, the people have been at peace. If the lottery tickets that have not been banned for a long time are found again, causing the dead ashes to reignite, the harm will be more severe than floods and beasts. Please convene a meeting immediately to stop the issuance, so that the poison is removed completely, so as to stabilize the local area and maintain the ban. It is heard that the Municipal Federation will convene a meeting immediately to discuss methods of prevention.</p>
<p>Shop on Rue Cardinal Mercier Appeals for Street Vendors</p>
<h3 id="e130">Protecting the Livelihoods of the Majority of Small Vendors: A Public Petition to the Director-General Urging Non-Eviction <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Guomin News Agency states that on the Kai Zi Er Road in the French Concession, there have long been over twenty stalls selling patterns, shoe materials, socks, and other goods. The stallholders all conduct honest business and have maintained a very harmonious relationship with the shops in the area for many years without incident. Unexpectedly, starting from the first day of last month, they were suddenly evicted by the Songshan Road police station in charge of the area, with offenders being detained and fined. This action has dealt a severe blow to the stallholders, affecting their families' livelihoods. Seeing this situation, the shops opened up space at their doorways, allowing the stalls to be set up inside, hoping to prevent further interference from the police station and allowing the stallholders to maintain their livelihoods. However, they were still evicted by the police station, leaving the stallholders' families with no means of support and their lives in dire straits, a truly pitiable situation. Outraged by this injustice, the shops, led by Hongfeng Pawnshop and others, jointly signed and stamped a petition to the French Director-General, requesting prompt relief. The original petition is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Petition to the Director-General: Regarding a request for action. It is a known fact that along this road (i.e., Kai Zi Er Road), stalls selling patterns, shoe materials, and other goods have been established for a long time. They have been paying daily dues to the authorities to obtain permits to operate. These stallholders are all honest, hardworking commoners. Although they set up their stalls on the roadside, they do not obstruct traffic or pose a hygiene hazard. There is no real need to ban them. However, since the first day of last month, they have been suddenly evicted without reason by the Songshan Road police station, with offenders being detained and fined. These stallholders are all from poor families who rely on their stalls for a living. This sudden blow has left them without any means of support, and there is a risk of starvation and exposure. Although our shops have no kinship or friendship ties with these stallholders, we are moved by the fact that they have been evicted without cause, leaving them unable to eat when hungry, unable to clothe themselves when cold, with no avenue for appeal, unable to stop, restless, and deeply disturbed. Their situation is truly pitiable. Therefore, we jointly sign and stamp this petition, requesting Your Excellency the Director-General to extend your benevolence to those under your jurisdiction and to understand the hardships of the common people. We ask that you allow them to return to their original state and continue to set up their stalls as usual. With the severe cold approaching, this would save the stallholders from the suffering of cold and hunger. They will all sing praises of Your Excellency's boundless virtue. We hereby make this appeal on their behalf, respectfully requesting your review and instructions for implementation. We await your reply with utmost anticipation to ease the public's concern.

<p>This Municipality to Hold International Charity Horse Race</p>
<h3 id="e131">Issuing 100,000 Special Prize Tickets, Event to Be Held on January 14 Next Year <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>This spring, the area north of Shanghai in this city suffered from the ravages of war, and the number of displaced and destitute people is countless. Although the municipal government and various organizations have raised funds for relief, the affected area is vast, the disaster is severe, and the relief efforts feel like a drop in the bucket, unable to benefit everyone. Now that the severe winter has arrived, the situation for the affected people, lacking clothing, food, and shelter due to the destruction of their homes, has become even more difficult. It is reported that Mayor Wu, aware of this situation, commissioned Cai, the Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, to represent the city government in negotiating relief measures with the Shanghai Race Club, the International Recreation Club, and the Chinese Jockey Club. An agreement has been reached to hold an international charity race at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse on Saturday, January 14 next year. There will be seven races starting at 1:30 PM that afternoon, with the fifth race being a special prize race. These special prize tickets are similar to the "Grand Champagne" tickets, but the first prize amount is twice as large. The current plan is to issue 100,000 special prize tickets, priced at ten yuan each, totaling one million yuan. Twenty-five percent will be deducted for disaster relief, and another twenty percent will be used for smaller horse position prizes. The remaining fifty-five percent will be used for the first, second, and third prizes (the first prize will receive seventy percent of the remainder, the second prize twenty percent, and the third prize ten percent). The Shanghai Race Club is entirely organized by Western merchants, and the Jiangwan International Recreation Club also has a majority of Western members. This charitable act demonstrates international cooperation in providing relief to disaster victims, and people from all walks of life in this city admire the enthusiasm of our friendly nations.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Two Bureaus Issue Public Notice on Measures to Ban the Buying and Selling of Used Copper Wire <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Public Notice from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and the Public Security Bureau: Regarding the issuance of a joint public notice. Considering that telephones are of utmost importance to transportation and public safety, especially during the winter prevention period, they must be strictly protected. Recently, there have been frequent incidents of telephone line theft. Although various district offices have solved cases and brought culprits to justice, ignorant and stubborn people, greedy for petty gains, are willing to risk the law, and the theft trend has not diminished. Unless the outlet for stolen goods is cut off, it will be insufficient to deter the wicked. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau has drafted five measures to ban the buying and selling of used copper wire, which have been jointly submitted by this bureau and others to the municipal government for approval. In addition to the Public Security Bureau sending a letter to the police departments of the two concessions to assist in implementation, this notice is hereby issued for public knowledge and compliance. If anyone dares to engage in private buying and selling, they will be severely punished without leniency upon detection. Let each be warned. Attached is a copy of the measures to ban the buying and selling of used copper wire: (1) All copper, tin, and five-metal smelting factories, electrical supply stores, and various scrap dealerships are prohibited from buying or selling all kinds of used copper, iron wire, and cables. However, this does not apply to the purchase or sale of old electrical wires from official communication agencies with a certificate of proof. (2) Smelting factories that purchase used copper wire or lead-sheathed cables must apply to the local Public Security Bureau in advance for inspection and obtain a permit. If the Public Security Bureau has doubts about the source of the wire, it may seal it first and notify the telecommunications agency for joint investigation. (3) Anyone transporting used copper wire or cables out of the country must have the carrier verify the certificate before allowing shipment. If the carrier does not have the certificate, they should immediately notify the Public Security Bureau to detain and investigate. (4) The Public Security Bureau has the right to inspect such factories and shops at any time. The telecommunications agency may also notify the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to conduct joint inspections when necessary. Anyone carrying various kinds of old electrical wires in public places without the certificate specified in Article 1 may be detained and investigated by the Public Security Bureau at any time. (5) Violators of Articles 1 to 3 may be prosecuted by the Public Security Bureau according to law for receiving stolen goods. Issued on December of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Huang Boqiao, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities; Wen Hong'en, Director of the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Chaozhou Native Association Requests Ministry of Finance to Order Release of Silver Ingots <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Guanghua Zhuang and other firms in Shantou reported to the customs for inspection and approval to transport seventeen boxes of silver ingots and seven boxes of silver coins to Shanghai. After unloading, they were seized by the Shantou Public Security Bureau, and six escort partners were detained, and an announcement was made that the goods would be confiscated and the parties punished. The Chaozhou Native Association of this city, based on the fact that the goods had been inspected and approved for transport by the customs, questioned why the Public Security Bureau had announced confiscation and punishment. They telegraphed the Guangdong-Shantou authorities to transfer the order for the release of the people and goods to maintain commerce. The case has now been presented to the provincial government by the Guangdong East District Pacification Commissioner's Office, ordering the confiscation of the silver ingots and coins and setting a date for auction. The Native Association yesterday reiterated its request, asking the Ministry of Finance to transfer the order to revoke the original order and release the silver. The document stated: (Excerpt omitted) The customs is a government agency, and it has the authority to determine whether silver ingots and coins can be exported in accordance with regulations. Merchants only need to report to customs for inspection. Once approved for transport after inspection, other agencies should not overstep their authority to illegally detain, confiscate, and punish people and goods. This not only affects the merchants' capital and the market's finances, but also has a significant impact on national laws and the credibility of the customs. We urgently request a review and request that you promptly telegraph the Guangdong Provincial Government to revoke the order to confiscate the goods and release the seventeen boxes of silver ingots detained from Guanghua Zhuang and other firms, as well as release the detained partners, to alleviate commercial difficulties and maintain credibility. We are deeply earnest in our plea. Enclosed are two copies of the original attachments. The Chaozhou Native Association of Shanghai bows in respect.</p>

<p>Dropsy Is Not Necessarily Incurable</p>
<h3 id="e135">Dropsy No-Love Pills Achieve Great Success, Medical Circles Nationwide Amazed <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Dropsy, a disease considered incurable by Chinese medical circles, also lacks a Western remedy. The only treatment involves using knives and needles to open up the abdomen, but the swelling soon returns. Therefore, only one in ten patients can be cured. Since the invention of "Dropsy No-Love Pills" by the Shanghai Zhengcheng Pharmacy (Yongan Company, Nanjing Road, Fourth Side Street), more than ten years ago, many people have been saved. For all types of dropsy, including watery swelling, abdominal distension, qi deficiency and fullness, women's blood dropsy, and children's food accumulation, taking these pills invariably leads to recovery. As a result, the medical circles nationwide consider it a groundbreaking miracle drug and actively recommend it. The pills' efficacy is both significant and rapid. Patients with mild cases can recover after taking half a dose, while those with severe cases will certainly improve after one dose. Detailed instructions are included. Send a letter with two cents for postage. The price is twenty yuan per dose, ten yuan for half a dose, and five yuan per box. No extra postage is charged for out-of-town orders. The original team also produces a miraculous frostbite remedy.</p>

<p>Frostbite is caused by congealed blood. In its early stages, it is red, swollen, and extremely painful. Once it breaks open, it oozes pus and is even more painful. This condition is especially prevalent during winter, and there is a lack of effective remedies. Patients suffer greatly. Now, the Zhengcheng Pharmacy in this city (Yongan Company, West Side Street, Nanjing Road) has invented two miraculous remedies: (1) "Pearl White Jade Cream," used to treat broken frostbite, removes rot and promotes new tissue growth, with rapid healing. (2) "Frostbite Wish-Fulfilling Water," used to treat unbroken frostbite, instantly stops pain and itching, and quickly reduces redness and swelling. The prices are extremely low. "Pearl White Jade Cream" sells for only forty cents per box, and "Frostbite Wish-Fulfilling Water" sells for only twenty cents per bottle, two yuan per dozen. Wholesale prices are particularly favorable. Add twenty cents for postage for out-of-town orders.</p>
<p>Songhu and Yangtze River Pilots' Grand Alliance</p>
<h3 id="e137">Hai Bu Gives... Organizing a Guild <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Piloting, also known as guiding, is essential for ships entering and leaving ports and rivers, ensuring the safety of navigation. Major powers have extremely strict regulations, and some even have special provisions prohibiting non-citizens from serving as pilots. In our country, the piloting business is mostly controlled by foreigners, which is the most serious case of selling out rights. The Yangtze River is our country's inland river, and allowing foreign ships to navigate it is a special agreement. As for private piloting, there are no such provisions. Currently, there are 24 Europeans and Americans and 21 Japanese privately acting as pilots outside the Cheng Hankuan customs. During the January 28th Incident, Japanese warships were able to enter our territory and destroy our Song Fortress and raid our capital, all due to these foreign pilots. If we did not have foreign pilots to guide them, they would not know our waterways, even with strong ships and sharp armor, because they are unfamiliar with our currents and sandbanks. Furthermore, foreign merchant ships entering our inland rivers are monopolized by foreign pilots, reversing the roles of host and guest, and the piloting business is increasingly shrinking. Chinese pilots are facing an even steeper decline. Yang Hanlin and others at the Preparatory Office of the Songhu Pilots' Guild in this city, in order to rescue the piloting business and safeguard navigation rights, have proposed a grand alliance of pilots to resist the encroachment of foreign pilots and plan to further petition the government to ban foreign pilots on the Yangtze River. A summary of the situation is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Alliance: The Yangtze River pilots in this city are divided into three groups: Zou, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, forming four guilds with a total of about 300 members. In addition to two-thirds of the pilots who are long-term employees of the six major shipping companies in this city for their Yangtze River routes, about 100 pilots are hired on a temporary basis. They lack unity and each acts for their own benefit. Whenever a ship sails on the Yangtze River, they compete for piloting jobs and drastically lower fees, disrupting the business and damaging the industry. Furthermore, there are those who lack experience and fill positions with unqualified individuals, risking valuable ships. In order to maintain the shipping industry and regulate the trade, it has been decided to form an alliance for cooperation.</p>
<p>▲Unity Measures: Yang and others from the Preparatory Office proposed that all pilots should unite and operate openly, avoiding the drastic competition of uneven fees. Yang convened all pilots to explain this purpose, and everyone expressed their agreement. The unity measures mainly involve uniting all pilots, organizing a guild, and providing services according to the qualifications of each pilot. Then, the general piloting office will distribute assignments fairly to ensure uniform fees and prevent unauthorized increases or decreases, thereby maintaining the livelihoods of the pilots.</p>
<p>Guaranteeing Navigation: After the pilots' grand alliance is formed and the guild is established, internal strife among colleagues can be eliminated, and piloting fees will be unified. Once the qualifications of the pilots have been assessed, shipping companies can avoid the various concerns of hiring temporary pilots. The safety of ships depends on the competence of the pilots. In the future, shipping companies only need to notify the guild when hiring pilots, and the guild will carefully select qualified pilots. This measure is also significant for guaranteeing navigation. It is reported that the various shipping companies and marine insurance associations in this city have expressed their support.</p>
<p>Business Licenses: The guild recently received instructions from the Naval Pilot Training Institute, stating that the institute had previously trained and issued certificates of completion to Yangtze River pilots, and now, based on the assessment of their qualifications, the institute should stamp the certificates to allow them to conduct business. The guild has notified all pilots to register with the guild before December 31 this year in order to apply for business licenses.</p>
<p>Piloting Fee Issue: It has been decided that the piloting fees will be implemented uniformly from January 1 next year, without any increase. Furthermore, special conveniences will be provided for foreign merchant ships and warships. The guild is located at No. 36 Sijing Road in this city.</p>
<p>English-American Tobacco Factory Child Labor Strike Resolved</p>
<h3 id="e138">All to Resume Work Uniformly at 7:00 AM This Morning <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The case of the child laborers in the leaf sorting room of the Pudong English-American New Factory going on strike was mediated again yesterday morning by the Social Affairs Bureau, which convened representatives from both the labor and capital sides. Chen Peide and Ruo Feng attended as labor representatives, Li Deke as the capital representative, Wang Gang as the presiding representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, and He Yuanming, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters, attended as an observer. After lengthy discussions, no satisfactory agreement was reached. Discussions continued at 3:00 PM and lasted for an hour and a half before a resolution was reached. A settlement agreement with five articles was signed: (1) Workers in all rooms of the New Factory will return to their original state and resume work as usual before 12:00 AM on the 10th of this month. (2) During the strike period, all workers in all rooms (including pieceworkers), except for the 72 child laborers in the leaf sorting room who will not be paid for three days, will be paid their full wages. (3) If the work of 22 child laborers in the leaf sorting room of the New Factory is deemed satisfactory by the factory within this month, their wages will be increased starting from the 16th of this month. (4) The wages of 9 child laborers in the leaf sorting room of the New Factory will be increased when their work performance is deemed satisfactory by the factory.

<p>Private Theft of Eighty Boxes of Raisins</p>
<h3 id="e140">Worth 494 Taels of Silver <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Lou Yuanxing, a clerk at the American raisin company located at No. 3 Guangdong Road, took eighty boxes of raisins worth 494 taels of silver from the Dis Wei Road warehouse at 4:30 PM on the 8th of this month. He hired a cart to transport them to the Huaxing Canned Food Company at No. 706 North Sichuan Road for temporary storage. Lou then hid at the home of Yi in Dayuan Lane No. 380, Adyat Road, planning to sell the raisins. The company discovered the theft the day before and reported it to the Dis Wei Road police station. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to arrest Lou and retrieve the stolen goods from the Huaxing Company. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the case originated because the company had recently placed orders with the Wansheng Canned Food Company in the Chinese-controlled Nanshi area and the Huaxing Company on North Sichuan Road. Wansheng ordered 80 boxes and Huaxing ordered 15 boxes. The defendant then used a 100-tael check from the China &amp; South Bank on North Sichuan Road, along with 40 yuan in cash, to take delivery of the goods in the name of Wansheng. It was found that the check was issued by Huaxing. The lawyer requested that the defendant be detained temporarily because the witnesses were not present in court today. He requested that the court summon the owner of Wansheng Company in Nanshi and the bank staff to testify about who the check was issued to and how much Wansheng Company ordered. Huaxing Company stated that the order was only for 15 boxes, and the defendant transported a large quantity of raisins, claiming that the rest were temporarily stored. There were some doubts. After Judge Zhao Linyu briefly questioned the defendant, he was returned to custody, and the case was adjourned to summon witnesses for further verification.</p>

Howell testified that he had visited Lu at the Jiujiang Shop at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 22nd to discuss car matters. Lu's lawyer, Wu Linkun, stated that after Lu went to Hangzhou, he stayed at the home of Lu Baoshan in Tianzhu and invited him to come to Shanghai to testify, but he declined because he was not involved. The court then ordered the start of arguments. The lawyers for Gao Changsheng, Fan Gang and Wu Linkun, and the police station's lawyer, Ru, debated each other. The court ruled that the crime could not be proven and acquitted Gao and Lu. Ru requested that they be kept under bond pending an appeal, and the court granted the request.</p>

<p>Mr. Yu Yikong's Message: ⑴ Due to men's narrow-mindedness, ⑵ due to women's desire for commerce and vanity, ⑶ due to the inability of both parties to respect each other. ⑴ Remedial measures: ⑴ Mutual trust, ⑵ mutual hard work and self-encouragement, ⑶ mutual respect, love without obstruction.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Qilu's Message: There are couples who live a lifetime without arguing. Let them argue. Remediation is not very effective.</p>
<p>Mr. Wei Qixiang's Message: ⑴ Due to the psychology of being unfaithful and liking the new and disliking the old, ⑵ the remedy is for both parties to reflect and reminisce, reflect on their own faults, and reminisce about past love, so that new love can arise from repentance.</p>
<p>Mr. Ying Zhifan's Message: ⑴ Due to the inability to control lust ⑵ one must work hard and remove desires.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Juefei's Message: ⑴ Due to the actual inequality of the status of men and women, women can be owned by men, then men can fully exert their possessiveness according to their likes and dislikes, and thus tragedy is staged. ⑵ ⑴ The root cause must be to transform the social system, ⑵ the man must respect the woman's personality, ⑶ the woman must broaden her horizons and not be troubled by trivial family matters.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Chunbo's Message: ⑵ Because before marriage, both parties failed to carefully examine each other's temperament, but blindly pursued the opposite sex, and because of the oppression of life after marriage, ⑵ from the beginning, don't regard love as too mysterious, don't rely entirely on emotional impulses, you must use reason to think about everything, thoroughly understand each other's personality, determine the standard for the progress of love based on your own environment, and the woman must also seek independence in life and not always rely on her husband.</p>
<p>Mr. Ting Kui's Message: ⑴ Before marriage, both parties hide their weaknesses. After marriage, all weaknesses are exposed. ⑵ Before marriage, you must thoroughly understand each other.

<p>Dongmen Road Fire</p>
<h3 id="e146">Zhu Chengzan Burned to Death <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yi Xing Foreign Goods Store, No. 24 Dongmen Road, outside Xiaodongmen, Nanshi, is divided into five departments: porcelain department, shoe department, galoshes department, sweater department, and sock department, all of which are jointly owned. The galoshes and sweater departments are managed by director Ge Baohua. The director of the porcelain department is named Mu Changchun, and the director of the shoe department is Yin. Usually, the income and expenses of each department are managed by the directors of each department, which is no different from setting up a stall. However, because the location of the store is suitable, the business is not bad. The total sales of various goods reach three to four hundred yuan per day. It has been open for more than half a year. Unexpectedly, at 0:30 yesterday morning, the store was not careful about fire and suddenly reported negligence. At that time, all the employees in the store had already gone to sleep. Fortunately, Li De, the seventh sentry policeman, noticed it and immediately broke open the gate of the store. The fire became more and more rampant, and flames pierced through the roof. After the Fire Brigade Association heard about it, it immediately rang the bell to report the news. The pump trucks from the fire brigades in each district rushed to the scene to connect the water and extinguish the fire. The employees in the store woke up from their dreams and fled out of their houses. Those who were staying upstairs saw that the stairs had been burned down and jumped out of the windows upstairs to escape. However, one of the employees named Zhu Chengzan, 21 years old, from Anhui, usually read novels and newspapers under the light after the store closed at about 9 pm, and did not sleep until about 11 pm, so he had to be called by others every morning to get up. When the fire broke out yesterday morning, although he was called by his colleagues, Zhu was sleeping soundly and did not wake up. He was forced to realize that the fire had started, and the room was filled with thick smoke. He fainted in an instant and could not escape, so he died in the fire. Before long, the fire was extinguished. The entire two-story building of the store was burned down. Zhu's body was found at the same time, his head and face were burnt, and it was unbearable to look at. Then the police took Xuan Wenchao, a shareholder of the store, to the first district. Under the preliminary trial by the district chief, because the store had fire insurance of 3,000 taels and the cause of the fire was unknown, in addition to sending the police to thoroughly investigate the truth of the fire, he prepared a document to send Xuan to the bureau for questioning. At the same time, he ordered the local chief to report to the local court to request an autopsy. At about 3 pm, Yang, the prosecutor entrusted by the court, and the coroner arrived at the scene and found that the deceased Zhu Chengzan was indeed burned to death by the fire. The body was handed over to his family to be coffined and buried, and a certificate was obtained for future reference. The coroner returned to the court after the autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The posthumous works of Mr. Mo Jiashi of Huating in the Former Ming Dynasty are published <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Jiashi, the seventh ancestor of Mr. Mo Zijing, a local elder of Shanghai, whose name was Chengqing, courtesy name Zixian, and posthumous title Zhenbai, was a contemporary figure of Chen Xia and other gentlemen of the Jisha Society in the late Ming Dynasty. His extant works include the "Bangqiu An Anthology" and the "Caiyin Cao Poetry Collection." The Mo family was originally from Huating, and had been officials for generations. His great-grandfather, Duke Zhongjiang, named Ruzhong, and his grandfather, Duke Tinghan, named Shilong, wrote poetry and prose that illuminated the four directions. Because of the chaos of the world, the gentleman lived in seclusion in the western suburbs of Shanghai. When the dynasty changed, he immediately decided to burn books and enter the mountains. Whenever he felt indignant, he recorded poetry and prose to express his aspirations, such as the "Praise of the Marquis of Wu and Jingjie" and the "Biography of the Four Loyalists" in the collection. His writing is unrestrained and ancient, and the tailoring does not exceed a single word, and the meaning is self-contained beyond words. His poems are pure, profound, and free from all vulgarity. His engravings are so extreme that he disdains to mention a single word from his predecessors. This collection contains 40 prefaces, 25 biographies, 3 epitaphs, 7 tombstones, 9 sacrificial texts, 7 introductions, 10 books, 2 records, 2 essays, 3 explanations, 3 debates, 1 saying, 1 explanation, 13 praises, 6 inscriptions, 5 inscriptions, 8 postscripts, 2 epilogues, 2 chronicles, 11 ancient poems in four characters, 67 in five characters, 44 in seven characters, 37 quatrains in five characters, 5 in six characters, 97 in seven characters, 25 ranked poems in five characters, 275 regulated verses in five characters, 102 in seven characters, and 40 lyrics. The original manuscript is written in fine calligraphy, which is the gentleman's hand-copied version in his later years, and is a true treasure. Among them, many taboo words against the Manchu Qing Dynasty are found in the "Biographies of Loyalty and Righteousness" and the "Shanghai Chaos." Therefore, his grandson kept the manuscript hidden and did not show it to others easily. After the founding of the Republic of China, it was made public, and many errors were caused by repeated copying. Therefore, it was handed over to the Zhonghua Book Company to be printed and bound into a book in Song imitation type on high-quality paper, totaling four large volumes. The printing cost was relatively high, and not many books were published. Saoye Bookstore on Qipan Street, Songjiang Saoye Bookstore, and Yizhi Bookstore in this port all have them for sale, priced at two yuan, to spread them widely. Contemporary writers should have a copy on hand to read first.</p>

Therefore, the troupe had to temporarily disband. All the professors and cadres introduced by the director resigned on the 10th of this month. Once talents are found, they will be restored.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, After investigating, this bureau was ordered to increase the quota of stamp tax. The method determined is to increase the original quota of each branch bureau by 20% uniformly. The increase is in the quota, not the tax rate. At the stamp tax meeting, it was clearly stated that the branch bureau chiefs should rectify and encourage sales and find ways to increase revenue in order to meet the quota, and should not be harsh due to the increase in quota. Now, I read in the newspaper that the local news column on the 9th of this month stated that the method of dispatch is that each branch bureau should uniformly increase 20% when collecting taxes. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. Fearing that a misunderstanding may arise, I am writing to you for correction in the Letter to the Editor column. Sincerely, Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, Ministry of Finance, December 9.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I was surprised to read a news item entitled "Detailed News of Rent Reduction and Exemption in North Sichuan Road" in the local news column of your newspaper on the 9th. After investigating, Sanxinli is managed by the law office of Dietback, and Yongfengfang and Xinxiangli are managed by the Wuhe Foreign Firm. There is no rent exemption for six months for Sanxinli and rent reduction of 30%, nor rent exemption for eight months and rent reduction of 40% for Yongfengfang and Xinxiangli as reported in your newspaper. We are sincerely concerned that inaccurate rumors may cause misunderstandings, so we are writing to you for correction and request that it be published in the Letter to the Editor column. Sincerely, Law Office of Dietback, No. 38 Aiduya Road, Wuhe Foreign Firm, No. 21 Yuanmingyuan Road, December 9, 21.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I have read the news column of your newspaper on the 7th of this month, which stated that the police obstructed the Boy Scouts, and that a police officer with number 2729 from the First Station of the Fifth District even obstructed them because he failed to obtain tickets. After investigating, this office does not have a police officer with that number, and this incident did not occur. Moreover, Baoshan Road is not within the jurisdiction of this office. It is indeed a rumor. Please correct it immediately. Sincerely, First Station of the Fifth District, Shanghai Public Security Bureau, December 9.</p>

<p>Important News of Education</p>
<h3 id="e159">Solid Division of Education Funds in Various Counties of Jiangsu <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Baozhen, Suxi, Chang Kunyu and other seven counties have already divided the funds. The Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office failed to divide the education funds in various counties properly. The financial bureaus of each county are directly commanded by the provincial departments, and the Education Funds Management Office is not directly under the jurisdiction of Yangzha. Therefore, there is no way to report the funds to the provincial departments first, and the management office is behind, and even the funds are misappropriated. As a result, the counties fail to report the education funds properly, and the education funds in Jiangsu Province are very tight. In order to eliminate this malpractice and seek to ensure the safety of the funds, the office has separated the busy cao under the field tax item of each county and saved it separately, and it is not collected by the county government's financial bureau. A special commissioner is appointed to withdraw the busy cao special funds from the county government's money and grain cabinet and save it separately to avoid misappropriation. At present, the counties that have followed this procedure include Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Wujin, Changshu, Kunshan, and Wuzhuo. The remaining counties are said to be planning to proceed. Yang Zishen and Liu Beihe, section chiefs of the office, are also rushing to various counties to supervise the work of the supervisors sent to urge the payment of education funds in order to collect the funds from various counties, together with the tens of thousands of yuan currently in stock, to distribute the funds to various schools and educational institutions in Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Director of Jiangsu Education Department Zhou Fo Hai Inspects Jiangbei Records (5)</p>
<h3 id="e160">County-Established Ruzhong School Address···Visiting Dasheng Textile Factory, Leaving Tongzhou for Shanghai and Then to Beijing <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Su (Jiangsu) Provincial Education Commissioner Zhou Fohai is scheduled to attend Ruzhou County-Established Middle School at 8:00 AM on the 8th. When the day arrives, [he will] temporarily go to the pavilion, (section chiefs and others will go to various places outside the city and the education experiment area). More than 300 teachers and students of the school warmly welcomed [him], attended a lecture, and were introduced by Principal Xu Xiaochong of the school. The significance of welcoming Commissioner Zhou is not ordinary: firstly, because he is the highest administrative officer of Jiangsu education; secondly, because he is the leader of our youth; and thirdly, because he is a good doctor for diagnosing the problems of Jiangsu education. Zhou took the stage to give an address, briefly mentioning four points: sincerity and diligence. ㈠ Regarding examinations, students should be prepared at all times and should not panic at the last minute. They should be like the military, prepared for wartime in peacetime and calm in wartime as in peacetime. ㈡ Regarding further education, families without the means should not force their children to pursue further education. If further education is difficult, as long as there is usual cultivation, there will be no problem. He briefly described his own experience as proof. ㈢ Regarding employment, the common problems in society today are both overstaffing and a lack of talent. In China today, where all industries are declining, although there are few employment opportunities, if one has rich knowledge and skills, there is no need to worry about not finding a place to succeed. However, one should not hope for too much, and should, as the ancients said, "aim high but start small." ㈣ Regarding moral character, junior high school students are in a period of rapid physiological and psychological change. During this period, if good habits can be formed, life will be beneficial; otherwise, life will be bad. It is hoped that teachers and staff will manage students strictly and not be negligent or mislead people. Students should also manage themselves strictly and not be romantic or self-indulgent. The address lasted for more than an hour, then he returned to his residence, changed to a car, and went to Tongzhou. At 12:00 noon, he arrived at Tangjiazha. He heard about the textile department of Nantong College, and had lunch. From 2:00 PM, he visited the department's practice facilities and inquired about the situation of teaching and training. Because it was a holiday for the Dasheng Textile Factory, the courses of the department are mostly related to practice, so there was no opportunity to inspect the class situation. He then went to Guangsheng Oil Factory to visit the manufacturing of cottonseed oil, and then to private primary schools such as Jingru Junior High School and the Workers' Children's Primary School for inspection. By the time it was 5:00 PM, he went to the general factory of Dasheng Textile Factory. Deputy Factory Manager Zhang Wenqian, auditor Wu Jixian, and others came out to greet him. The factory's industrial guard regiment and the public security bureau's soldiers and police lined up, played music, and saluted with guns. At this time, those who rushed from the city to welcome him, such as County Magistrate Zhang, the heads of the four bureaus, the county party committee, representatives of various educational institutions and groups, and gentry, etc., as well as Haimen County Magistrate Zhang and Education Bureau Director Lu, also rushed from afar. Zhou met them one by one and had a pleasant conversation. At about 6:00 PM, he visited all parts of the general factory in great detail, and praised the factory's achievements and its position in China's textile and economic circles. After dinner, he continued to visit until 10:00 PM before saying goodbye to those who were seeing him off. He took a car to the Yongchao Inn in Lujing Port to wait for a boat. At about 12:00 midnight, he went to Tianshenggang to board the boat to Shanghai and then to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee. On this day, Tangjiazha and the area along the way were covered with welcome slogans, and lanterns and flags were hung to express welcome.</p>

<p>Actively Identify Students and Expedite Aftermath Arrangements</p>

The Department of Education has forwarded the telegram from the Ministry of Education to the school for its information. According to He Siyuan, Director of the Department of Education, regarding the aftermath of the senior high school, identification will be implemented immediately. The senior high school will convene a school affairs meeting to formulate various identification methods, which will be handled soon. At that time, the Department will also send personnel to supervise the venue in order to show prudence. After the identification is completed, classes will begin. In the future, enrollment will continue. Song Huanwu, the principal of the senior high school, has resigned twice, and has been persuaded to stay and ordered to supervise everything and continue to proceed.

The Department ordered the dissolution of the school, and it should be approved for the record. It is especially necessary to strictly identify the students and hold the identification date before the start of the next semester and postpone the summer vacation in order to emphasize academics. At the same time, carefully select the school's teachers and staff in order to implement strict training and create a good school spirit. This is the most important thing.

<h3 id="e172">Students Whose Parents Have Left Shanghai Are Ordered to Withdraw <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Those who have already left Shanghai will not be allowed to re-enroll in the fall.</p>
<p>The schools established by the Shanghai Municipal Council have never enrolled children from outside Shanghai, that is, those who reside in Shanghai but are not taxpayers in the Public Concession, and their children must also pay an additional quarter of the tuition fee. The Education Committee decided at the last meeting that from now on, these affiliated students must be admitted only when there is a surplus of children of taxpayers in the concession. It was also found that there are 33 Western children and 32 Chinese children in the Council's schools whose parents have already left Shanghai. After consideration by the committee, these students should be ordered to withdraw from school in accordance with the regulations. However, it is easier for Chinese children to transfer schools and there are fewer difficulties, while if Western children are ordered to withdraw from school, there may be more difficulties, especially those who have reached the graduation level. However, since the Council's schools are maintained by the taxpayers' donations and tuition fees, there should be a fair way to do things. Therefore, it was resolved that: (1) Children whose parents have already left Shanghai will not be allowed to re-enroll after June 1933, and those with special circumstances should report to the Education Committee for special consideration. (2) In the future, if parents of students leave Shanghai, their children should be ordered to withdraw from school immediately. This resolution was submitted to the Board of Directors on the 7th for consideration and approval.</p>

In the future, it is hoped that your Association will convene Executive Committee Meetings and General Meetings of Members on schedule to facilitate rectification. Furthermore, if any of the original Executive Committee members of the Education Associations in each district are elected as Directors and Supervisors of the Municipal Education Association in this session, they should resign immediately, and the alternate Executive Committee members should be successively filled in.

<p>The Minhang People's Education Hall in Shanghai County, in order to encourage the people's spirit of studying art and cultivate the people's interest in appreciating art, has specifically decided to hold an art exhibition in the Hall on the 16th, 17th, and 18th of this month.

<h3 id="e176">The Training Headquarters Sends Personnel to Inspect the Fudan Student Volunteer Army <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>In order to promote military training in various schools, the Training Headquarters specially sent personnel to various schools to inspect and examine the results. This morning, they went to inspect the Fudan University Student Volunteer Army. When Major Chen Bingchang, the inspecting officer, arrived at the school, the students had already lined up in formation, a total of four battalions, and the band conductor Chen Wude. Chests full of medals were directing back and forth, extremely busy. Instructor Guo Jian coordinated everything. At 10:00, Lin [missing character], Chairman of the School Military Commission, and Zhang Yifei led the inspecting officer to the venue. After each battalion saluted as usual and inspected the formation, the performance began. The combined platoon training was commanded by Wu Zhaisen, the first battalion commander and a graduate of the former 19th Route Army's Follow-up Training Class. The students marched neatly and were full of spirit. The fierce north wind made their vigor even more evident, and the inspecting officer nodded in approval. After the performance, the military exercise was changed to weapon exercises, performed by the second battalion. First, there were various basic exercises, and then there were trench charges and bayonet drills. The sound of gunfire and shouts of killing shook the ears, and the onlookers even suspected that they were on the front line. After various military exercises, the inspecting officer gave a speech, saying that the Fudan student volunteer army was training conscientiously and moving sensitively, but there were still some small actions that had not been paid attention to. However, judging from today's results, it is truly the champion of all schools, and it is truly an honor for your school. Regarding the issue of issuing firearms, it is currently not possible to issue them immediately. It is necessary to observe the achievements of each school and whether the authorities of each school can be responsible. The Training Headquarters is planning to develop and rectify military training in various schools, and will have the instructors of each school directly commanded by the Headquarters. However, the Headquarters is feeling extremely short of funds, and it is feared that it will be difficult to realize it for a while.</p>

<p>Originally, the Great East Book Company's Family Education Lecture scheduled for yesterday was to feature Professor Zhang Yaoxiang of Jinan University speaking on "Children's Psychological Problems." However, due to other engagements, Mr. Zhang was replaced by Mr. Meng Shouchun, editor-in-chief of the Great East Book Company, who spoke on "A Comparison of Chinese and American Families." His speech briefly stated: I studied in the United States for eight years. Besides studying academically, I also paid attention to their family situations, so I could offer a reference for improving Chinese families after returning to China. Now, let's start with the organizational structure. American families have a small organizational structure, while Chinese families have a large organizational structure. Therefore, their family organization is unusually simple. However, they tend to live with the mother-in-law rather than be supported by parents. This is because there cannot be two mistresses in a family. The mother-in-law can still listen to the orders of the aunt, but the young mistress finds it difficult to listen to the orders of the old lady. Conflicts between daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law are thus eliminated. This is also a characteristic of American families, so I often call American families matrilineal, while Chinese families are patrilineal. In addition, there are various comparisons in terms of economics, morality, marriage, etc., which are extremely interesting. Due to space limitations, I cannot record them all. It is said that today Zhang Yaoxiang will change to speak on "The Lives of Children in Our Country."</p>

<p>丨Rebound of Five Taels and Nine Qian丨</p>
<p>(Breaks Above the 800 Taels Mark Again) After days of successive declines, the benchmark gold price showed signs of rebounding yesterday, breaking through the 800 taels mark again with rapid momentum. However, the volume was limited and the fluctuations were relatively calm, with a range of only four taels or so throughout the day. Overall, it rose by five taels and eight qian. Sentiment was strong. The silver market saw a decline in British prices and stable American prices, but the forward rates fell. The exchange rate saw a rise in British rates and a fall in American rates. The gold price initially rose sharply because of this. Afterwards, due to the clear reduction and hidden stability of foreign exchange, it slightly recovered two taels or so. Sellers did not relax. In the afternoon, the trend weakened and the market softened, returning within the 800 taels mark. Finally, news was heard that France may repay war debts, and the gold price was pulled back to the 800 taels mark. Here is a record of the market conditions before and after.</p>
<p>(Opening Jumps Four Taels and Nine Qian) The opening price for January rose sharply by four taels and nine qian to 799.2 taels. Then, it rose to nine taels. It was learned that the private telegram from the American bank had reported a small three-eighths. Yuan Mao Yong, Dan Chang, Yong Heng Xing, Heng Yu, and others were the first to enter, and American gold was also firm. The three-month transaction was 3.125, and January was 0.625, continuing to rise by three taels to 801.9 taels. Shortly afterwards, HSBC and others offered January American gold at 1.25. Fuyu, Yuanchun, Yuantai, and others sold. At that time, it was 2.0 qian, 9:20 AM at 99.7 qian. At 9:30 AM, HSBC's listed prices revealed that British gold shrank by 0.125 and American gold shrank by 0.375, so small exchanges were compressed, and the price at that time was around 801 taels. Yuan Xing, Yong Yi Feng, Yong Yuan Tai, and others entered. Zhengjin absorbed three-month American gold at 0.375. Citibank and Macaulay traded January at 0.125. At 9:45 AM, it was 801.7 taels. After that, Yi Feng, Yong Da, Decheng, Futai, Hengtai, Fengcheng, Yuan Mao, Yong Lai came out. January American gold still settled at 0.125, February at 0.25, and March at 0.375. The gold price was down two taels or so. In the middle, there was only a difference of one tael or so. At 10:40 AM, at 99.1 qian, it was suddenly reported that Britain might repay American debts in gold pounds. Heng Yu, Fuyu, Futai Heng, Yuanchun, and others all entered. HSBC absorbed Citibank's current 0.125. At 11:30 AM, it was 801.3 taels. Unexpectedly, short positions did not disappear.

It was heard that France had information about repaying American debts. Yin Hui was slightly smaller. Yi Feng, Yong Zhi Feng, Yong Heng Yu, Yuan Xing Yong, and others all had purchases.

<p>(Domestic Market Sees British Lengthening and American Shrinking, Bank Transactions Not Prosperous)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market saw British shrinking (reversal after three days of successive gains) and American leveling, but the private telegram reported a shortening of 0.375. The exchange rate saw British against American continue to rise by 0.375, and American against British was reported to have fallen by 2.4375, so the Shanghai market was激昂. HSBC's listed prices saw British shrink by 0.125 and American shrink by 0.375. The rest were uniformly more expensive, but Hong Kong remained the same. It seems that the domestic market had a slightly different trend. British gold saw a clear shortening and a hidden lengthening, and American gold saw a tight明盘 but a solid暗盤. The market was relatively flat in the morning, then there was a slight reversal, and the market was stable at noon. In the afternoon, both British and American prices均. The final result was that British gold lengthened by 0.0625 and American gold only shrank by 0.125 compared to the previous day. However, the gold market showed signs of rebounding, and finally rose sharply by about six taels. The hedging was quite appropriate. The volume of transactions at various banks was not as prosperous as the day before yesterday. The British gold volume was sparse, and the American gold volume was only 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Most of the gold industry was扒结, and the banks did a little transaction with each other. However, Citibank sold short positions, and the volume of transactions was even smaller in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The financial world is the hub of each industry of the silver dollar剂, and Shanghai's prosperity in commerce is the best in the country, so it should be very繁多. However, due to repeated foreign regrets and commercial invasions, many have been abandoned, and the Chinese people have not strengthened cultivation and cultivation, and there are even those who are coerced and destroyed. The thinness of cargo commerce sits on Sri Lanka, and the financial system has no way to turn around, and this is also greatly affected. Therefore, although the end of this year is no longer far away, the procedures have not been busy, and this is probably the idea.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<h3 id="e201">Bond Prices Plunge by Around Two Yuan <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>(Market Sentiment Weak, Decline Sharpest, Trading Exceeds 11.3 Million)</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 9th), the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw sparse spot transactions; futures trading was brisk with prices falling. Upon investigation, bond prices opened weak at the start of the morning, reflecting market sentiment and large holders engaging in disposals. Scattered sales were smooth, leading to a general decline in prices, ranging from several fractional amounts to over one yuan. During the mid-session, the market showed some buying interest, causing prices to fluctuate. The afternoon opening saw no major changes initially, but buying momentum picked up, leading to a continued decline. The closing session saw the sharpest drop, reaching around one yuan, due to dwindling buying interest and persistent selling pressure. Consequently, aside from the minimal fluctuation of the 96 Financial Bonds, the Sixth Consolidated and Customs &amp; Disbandment bonds each dropped by a little over one yuan, while others fell by a significant amount, ranging from 1.67 to 2.5 yuan. It is said that the sudden drop in bond prices is due to the approaching year-end and the increasingly pessimistic outlook on diplomatic relations with Japan, making the overall environment less favorable. The total value of spot transactions for the day was only 20,000 yuan, while futures trading amounted to 5.17 million in the morning and over 6.1 million in the afternoon, totaling 11.33 million yuan.</p>

<p>Diminishing Transactions</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is becoming increasingly sluggish. Actual demand is also quite calm, generally because financing is difficult and business is particularly lackluster, leading to a dispersed and sluggish market. However, the underlying support is exhausted, and despite the poor environment, sellers are wary and dare not aggressively short sell, resulting in increasingly diminished transactions, creating a situation where both bulls and bears are hesitant.</p>
<p>(Human Biao Idle) At the opening of the Human Biao morning market, although the US cotton production increased, there was still a lack of new sellers in the market. The previous day's good sales to customers continued to have a lingering effect, and prices rose by 2-3 qian for each month. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual sales were not high, and market sentiment was scattered, with near-month contracts remaining unchanged and far-month contracts rising by 1 qian. The total transaction volume for today was 8,000 bales. Sales included Rongxing at 400 bales, Hua at 400 bales, Ruidai at 400 bales, Dachang at 350 bales, and Mingde at 300 bales. Purchases included Yudai at 400 bales, Tongyu at 500 bales, Shenji at 300 bales, and Lichang at 250 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Human Biao | Closing Change | Inventory    |</p>

<p>(Yarn Sales Stagnant Again) The removal of current yarn has again become sluggish. It is found that the total purchases by various groups for the whole day are only 480 packages. The market is similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each group is listed below.</p>
<p>Sichuan 250, Guangdong 25, Datong 5, Luzhou 60</p>

<p>The cotton market remains firm, but the US cotton government estimates that production has increased by another 780,000 bales. This quantity is quite alarming, but market prices have not been affected, so the people in this port are also calm as usual. The extreme shortage of spot goods is also a major factor. A certain manufacturer released a large amount, and in view of the decline in sources from all sides, will replenish the near months, and the market is tight. However, the decline of Indian cotton is uncertain, but it is temporarily difficult to get close to the Shanghai market.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Good Qian Half) At the opening of Zheng Biao's previous market, although US cotton increased, its decline was not large, and the gold market rose, and the public sentiment was still stable. Moreover, sellers replenished, and each month rose by one and a half qian. The situation remained hard at the afternoon opening, and each month was flat, with a 5-fen rise in the distance. The total transaction volume for the day was 28,700 dan, and the sales included Yuanda at 2,300 dan, Ruidai at 1,800 dan, Chang at 3,100 dan, and Mingde at 1,500 dan. Purchases included Xincheng at 5,000 dan, Shenji at 1,000 dan, Qingfeng at 2,100 dan, Zhenda at 1,000 dan, and Yiyu at 800 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>Overseas Cotton Weak Across the Board</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially weakened due to Liverpool news favoring shorts, but later strengthened due to manufacturer purchases and short covering. Futures fell 3 to 8 points, while spot prices were unchanged. English cotton futures fell 8 points and spot prices fell 14 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 14 points. Indian cotton weakened due to unfavorable Liverpool news, with Pingguoer falling 3.5 rupees, Aofula falling 1 rupee, and Bailuoxi falling 2.5 rupees.

<p>Rice Market Situation Improving</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources at West Road decreased slightly, about 50-odd boats. City shops had better appetite than the previous market. Yang Du Jian was sold as soon as it arrived, and the price was firm by about 1 jiao. Su Tong Bang and Changxi North Japonica were all raised by 1 jiao and a half. Early and late rice, Jin and Guang's two groups were handled, and the price was also tight, changing to shade and the yuan to selling well or poorly. The situation is downstream.</p>
<p>(New Zha) Yesterday, only 32 rice boats from Changxi and Xianzizi, and other groups under Suzhou River arrived. Trading was flat in the morning, but in the afternoon, a telegram from Changshu said that the market for brown japonica was improving and the public was excited. Northern Japonica and Bo Dao rose by more than 1 jiao, and Yang Du Jian and Yuan Yuan were stable.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Rumors of Taiwan Rice Being Dumped in Tianjin <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Three Batches of Near and Far Term Transactions | Price 9 Yuan 3, 4, 5 Jiao</p>
<p>According to news from Tianjin, Japanese merchants in Tianjin are trying their best to sell flour, wheat, and rice in the market. Both flour and wheat have considerable transactions. Australian flour and wheat, handled by Japanese merchants, are priced 5 fen less than those of British and American merchants, or even close to money. At present, the local flour and wheat have fully satisfied their appetite. It is heard that Jiangnan white rice will be transported north, and Taiwanese rice in stock is being sold at a discount. A small amount of Taiwanese rice was transported to Tianjin for trial sales the day before yesterday, which was very suitable for the local foodies. However, the asking price was around 11 yuan, but now the price has been reduced, and a batch of near and far terms has been negotiated and loaded. Spot goods are 9.5 yuan in Tianjin currency, near-term is 9.4 yuan, and delivery next year is only 9.3 yuan. Therefore, the Tianjin rice market has been affected, and the white Japonica, which once sold as high as 13.5 yuan, has gradually dropped to close to 12 yuan. According to this statement, there are also rumors in the rice industry, but Tianjin grain merchants have not admitted it. Whether it is true or not, I think there will be facts to prove it soon.</p>

<p>(Manufacturers Limit Prices and Sell a Small Amount)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally stable in the morning for each month. Foreign wheat quotations fluctuated very little, and manufacturers generally remained cautiously selling few. Foreigners' sentiments were slightly active, so each month was slightly better than the previous day by about 5 li. Until the afternoon, when the market opened, trading was slightly smooth. It was heard that the Fu and Gao factories had limited prices for sales, and there were a few sales in March, April, and May. Because the market rumored that there were military actions in Shanhaiguan, and the Tianjin gang had received private telegrams, people's minds were inevitably more empty. However, manufacturers quoted prices for transactions, and the quantity was not large. As for foreign wheat, there was no fixed price yesterday. However, for Australian wheat loaded on a ship in January, the foreign firm was willing to sell at 3.25 yuan, but the manufacturer had to change it to February, which was not achieved. As a result, this month was slightly better than the previous day by 2.5 li, January was slightly worse by 2.5 li, February was unchanged, March was slightly worse by 2.5 li, and May was slightly worse by 5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Wheat Futures Quiet <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally stable in the morning and afternoon for each month. Foreign wheat quotations did not fluctuate much, so both buyers and sellers were calm. However, the sale of foreign wheat continued, and people were inevitably worried. Although the current wheat crop is not abundant, foreign wheat can be used for delivery. At present, it is heard that there are two or three ships of chips on the industry's side, and they are waiting for an opportunity to cash out, so the situation in the future is ultimately easy to be controlled by foreign wheat. Each market transaction only fluctuated by 1 fen, and the results were all the same.</p>

<p>Sin Fung &amp; Co. Report: On Thursday (the 8th), Chicago wheat initially fell due to long liquidation, but then rose due to poor winter wheat production conditions, resulting in no change. The trading volume on the 7th was 10 million bushels. The market prices on the 8th are listed below:</p>
<p>|             | Closing Price | Compared to Previous Day |</p>
<p>| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |</p>
<p>| December    | 44.875        | Up 0.125              |</p>

<p>(London Forward Sugar Returned Down 1 Shilling 75)</p>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram from New York on the 8th said that spot sugar prices rose slightly to 8.75 cents, and futures for December were unchanged at 1.359 cents per pound. July was higher by 2 pounds. Also, on the same day, a telegram from London said that December fell half a penny to 5 shillings and 4 pence, March was down 1 shilling and 75 pence to 5 shillings and 6.75 pence, May was down 1 shilling and 75 pence to 5 shillings and 8.50 pence. Also, Java white sugar remained at 8 shillings and 3 pence, unchanged. As for the sugar market in this port, the gold salt saw a good return, but the sales remained sluggish. The association's allocation trend remained the same. High-quality 24 coarse sand white was allocated at 15 taels and 4 qian, with a few transactions. The substitute currency was called at 15 taels and 3 qian and a half, but no allocation was seen. However, it was heard that a dark allocation of 3 qian had been made the night before, so yesterday's entrants only dared to bid this price, resulting in no transaction. Xin Chaoqing borrowed 90 packages yesterday, and opened at 9 taels and 2 qian and a half to 3 qian immediately, which was better than before by 2 qian. Mianhu Chi, opened a few dozen packages, the price was 10 taels 07 qian. Gaozhuang Huizhou White opened 100 packages, the price was 15 taels and 3 qian and a half. Gao Pianqing opened 40 odd packages at 9 taels and 1 qian. Also, Guangbang Hao opened 200 packages of ordinary Pianqing at 8 taels and 8 qian.</p>

<h3 id="e237">The Capture of Square Fort (3) <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— French Mériel's Photographic Translation</p>
<p>We followed the assault team, running forward: The Russian soldiers suddenly let out three shouts, three distinct shouts, then fell silent, not firing a shot.</p>
<p>"I don't like this silence," the company commander said; "it's not a good sign at all."</p>
<p>I felt our soldiers were too noisy, and I couldn't help but secretly compare their chaotic shouts with the enemy's solemn silence.</p>
<p>We quickly reached the foot of Square Fort. The barricades had been destroyed by our shells, and the ground churned up. The soldiers, shouting "Long live the Emperor," jumped over the new ruins and broken walls, their shouts even louder than the countless times they had shouted before.</p>
<p>I raised my eyes, and I will never forget what I saw. Most of the smoke had risen, hanging like a canopy twenty feet above Square Fort. Through the bluish haze, we could see the Russian soldiers behind their half-collapsed fortress, raising their weapons, as still as statues. I can still see each soldier with his left eye fixed on us, his right eye hidden by the gun he was holding up. A few steps away from us, beside a cannon's muzzle, a man stood with a lit torch in his hand.</p>
<p>I trembled all over, thinking my last moment had come.</p>
<p>"Alright, the dance is about to begin, goodnight!" my company commander shouted.</p>
<p>These were the last words I heard him utter.</p>
<p>A drum roll came from inside Square Fort. I saw all the guns tilting. I closed my eyes, and I heard a hateful explosion followed by shouts and groans. I opened my eyes, and I was surprised to find myself still alive. Square Fort was once again enveloped in smoke. Around me were wounded and dead bodies. My company commander lay face down at my feet: his head blown to pieces by a shell, I was covered in his brains and blood. Only six soldiers and I were left alive in our company.</p>
<p>Following this massacre was a moment of shock. The regimental commander, with his hat on the end of his sword, was the first to climb the fortress, shouting "Long live the Emperor!" Immediately, everyone who was alive followed him up. I can hardly remember what happened next. I don't know how we ran into Square Fort. The two sides fought hand-to-hand in the thick smoke where nothing could be seen. I believe I must have killed someone with my saber, because it was covered in blood. Finally, I heard someone shout; "Victory!" The smoke gradually cleared, and I saw blood and corpses covering the soil of Square Fort. The cannons were all buried under piles of corpses. About two hundred men, wearing French uniforms, gathered together in a confused state, some loading their guns, others wiping their bayonets. Standing with them were eleven Russian prisoners.</p>
<p>The regimental commander lay bleeding on a broken ammunition box near the entrance to the battery. Several soldiers rushed to surround him; I went closer.</p>
<p>"Where is the oldest company commander?" he asked a sergeant.</p>
<p>The sergeant shrugged his shoulders with a very expressive look.</p>
<p>"What about the oldest lieutenant?"</p>
<p>"Well, this gentleman arrived yesterday," the sergeant said in a very calm voice.</p>
<p>The regimental commander smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>"Well then, sir, you are in command now; please quickly have the entrance to Square Fort fortified with wagons, because the enemy still has the strength to attack; but General C will come to help you." he said to me.</p>
<p>"Regimental commander, are you badly wounded?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Ah... dear, but Square Fort has been captured!"</p>

<h3 id="e238">"Patriotic Lottery Tickets" <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper reported that the Shanghai Local Association sent a letter to the Municipal Government, requesting that the issuance of so-called "Patriotic Lottery Tickets" be stopped. A gentleman said: This is not only "disappointing," but it is simply like "forbidding patriotism!"</p>
<p>Originally, since last year's September 18th Incident, when the Japanese boldly created the so-called "national crisis" for us, "national crisis" and "patriotism" immediately became the most fashionable slogans on our lips. At first, the public cried for the "national crisis" and paraded to demonstrate "patriotism." As a result, Nanjing was often crowded with "patriotic men," and the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum was especially soaked with a lot of "tragic tears." After a while, the public felt that tears were ultimately limited, and that parades and demonstrations were inevitably too strenuous. Thus, "crying" changed to "shouting," "Long-term resistance!" "Armed recovery of lost territories!" This way, shouts spread throughout the country! After a longer period of time, the public again felt that there were many ways to save the country. It was true that one did not have so many tears to cry all the time, and it was also a bit exhausting to keep shouting all the time. As long as we maintained a bit of sincerity and never forgot, then where would we not be suitable? And the way of "long-term resistance" was precisely contained within this. As the saying goes, "Know it mysteriously and understand it clearly, it exists in the person." Once this thought was turned around, all worries were dispelled. As a result, "crying" stopped and "shouting" ceased. Everyone put on the nonchalant air of a great power. Those who played cards could play eight rounds of "national crisis" cards, and those who danced might as well dance a few rounds of "national crisis" dances. As for "marriages during the national crisis" and "birthday celebrations during the national crisis," these were even more grand and justified. In any case, as long as "national crisis" or "patriotism" was linked to things like "playing cards" and "dancing," then the way of "patriotism" was exhausted, and a heart that was always "bittersweet in joy" could also be seen by all. By extension, if we had money, we might as well go to enjoy "nation-saving" "entertainment." If we had talent, we might as well "save the nation through entertainment," because these were all great avenues to save the country. As for simply taking out money to donate to the volunteer army fighting the Japanese soldiers in the frozen lands of the Northeast, or impulsively rising up and actually joining the volunteer army to fight the Japanese head-on, those were all fools and idiots!</p>
<p>Since the public was all so "patriotic" and "nation-saving," then the issuance of "Patriotic Lottery Tickets" was not simply following the trend of the times, walking the great road of "patriotism." And the Local Association actually did not allow the patriotic lottery tickets to be "patriotic," so the gentleman again said: "To err is human; is that not so?"</p>

<p>Shuhua smiled in a very interesting way after speaking.</p>
<p>"It's cold here, let's go to the classroom to talk."</p>
<p>Haiquan was never willing to delay time because of meaningless talk.</p>
<p>"Okay. Let's go inside. Class is starting soon."</p>
<p>Shuhua responded to Haiquan.</p>
<p>"Don't you come to our sacred classroom!"</p>
<p>"Who wants to go to your zoo with stale air!... Doesn't understand anything, just shits every day, buys that shit!"</p>
<p>Shuhua twitched her nose at the short man, then, with a flick of her left high-heeled shoe, she turned around, and the hem of her coat drew a semicircle, touching the hem of Haiquan's cotton robe.</p>
<p>"Sorry."</p>
<p>She suddenly smiled at him again.</p>
<p>"It's okay."</p>
<p>He replied, while thinking that touching a part of her coat was already a "stroke of good luck," so why was she apologizing to himself.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't have that idea!"</p>
<p>He quickly suppressed the overflowing emotions, while also recalling the situation when he accidentally shook hands with Mrs. Hezi while watching a movie last night. He thought,</p>
<p>"Men are always loving."</p>
<p>The three of them walked through the mountain path of the campus and arrived at the left entrance of the main building.</p>
<p>Another gust of north wind sweeping dense yellow dust rushed towards them from behind the main building. They quickly went inside. Their classroom was downstairs. Ms. Zhuo's classroom was on the third floor.</p>
<p>"It's going to snow soon."</p>
<p>She said, and with one hand on the railing, stepped on a few steps of the ladder.</p>
<p>The two of them walked into the science classroom. Indeed, as soon as they entered from the outside, they smelled a stale odor. Most of the students had arrived. Some were sitting and reading newspapers, some were copying notes, some were standing by the window daydreaming, and some were standing on the podium, writing large characters on the blackboard with half a chalk.</p>
<p>"The weather is particularly cold early this year."</p>
<p>"Damn it! They charge us so much tuition, and the classroom doesn't even have a stove."</p>
<p>"It's so cold. I really don't want to take notes."</p>
<p>"Demand handouts!"</p>
<p>"Agree! With handouts, you don't even have to go to class."</p>
<p>"Old Wang, that would be great. With handouts, you'd still be sleeping in bed at this hour, right? Haha, haha!"</p>
<p>"What does Old Li equal to?"</p>
<p>One student asked a student sitting in front of him, holding a notebook.</p>
<p>"One four one four one two two"</p>

<h3 id="e240">A Study of Cursing <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Zou</p>
<p>A German once told me that cursing is most developed in Germany, and that there had even been a dictionary of cursing published. After listening, I secretly thought that this crown might not be worn by the Germans. Although education is not widespread in China, the art of cursing is very widespread. Illiterate village women are all doctors of cursing. If the cursing words from all over China were collected, they would definitely become a very, very large dictionary. Now let me classify and discuss the origins and uses of cursing words. In general, the purpose of cursing is to make the cursed person feel unpleasant emotions. Under this general purpose, various methods have arisen. ㈠ The saying goes, "Humans are the spirit of all things," and mankind has always respected itself and despised animals other than humans. Therefore, curses such as "beast," "pig," and "raised by a dog" have arisen. ㈡ China is a Confucian country, especially worshipping ancestors. Moreover, because it is a male-centered society, sexual intercourse has always been regarded as something that men initiate and women passively receive, as if the initiator is benefiting and the receiver is at a disadvantage. Therefore, curses such as "fuck your mother" and "fuck your ancestors" have arisen. When women curse people by saying "fuck your mother," it is nothing more than wanting to regard themselves as the initiator. In Susong, Zhejiang, there is the curse "fuck your father," which can be explained by this. This kind of curse is the opposite of extreme respect for Confucianism, so it is limited to China. ㈢ Because of the emphasis on men and the devaluing of women, women's reproductive organs are regarded as extremely dirty and lowly things, so when cursing women, curses such as "stinky cunt" and "cheap cunt" have arisen. ㈣ Pointing out the cursed person's dishonorable places to shame him, such as "pockmarked face" and "lame three." ㈤ Death is what everyone dislikes, and unusual ways of dying are even more disliked. Therefore, curses such as "beheaded," "thousand cuts," "little ghost," and "beheading ghost" have arisen. ㈥ Cursing words are originally words of emotion, so they are often transformed and used as interjections, becoming the speaker's catchphrase. For example, when people in Guangdong speak to each other: "Sir, damn that mother, yesterday I went out, damn that mother..." and so on, too numerous to mention.</p>
<h3 id="e241">The Sisters I Cherish <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Biyao</p>
<p>The sisters we don't know are all those we encounter when we go out, and the sisters we do know are also countless; however, the ones that are carved deepest in our hearts are only a few for each person. The few in my heart do not necessarily have particularly deep feelings for me, but rather their unfortunate backgrounds, each representing a type of person, make me feel touched when I encounter that type of archetype, and then I think of that one sister. Although life is wandering and uncertain, the images of these few sisters are deeply rooted in my heart, constantly drawing out the flowers of memory, making people feel lost and unable to control themselves.</p>
<p>1.  Suffering Yahong</p>
<p>Before the age of seventeen or eighteen, Yahong was truly what was called "lotus-like face and willow-like eyebrows." Her father feared that her beautiful face would bring her a short life, so he gave her this name. But in fact, the roots of a short life had already been planted at that time. In the thoughts of the late Qing Dynasty, as long as a woman lived a long life and married a husband to grow old with, that would be a great blessing; as for whether their spiritual condition was compatible, that was irrelevant. She was born with a husband, no, she was summoned because there was already such a marriage contract concluded in the world. When she was born, her betrothed husband was riding a bamboo horse in the yard! When that boy was seven or eight years old, he suffered a serious illness. When he fully recovered, he lost most of his intelligence and became a semi-idiot. Later, they studied in the same school, Yahong was a leader in Class A, and he was at the bottom of Class D. This was in the Xuantong era, when male and female students did not communicate when they met; however, mischievous boys often wrote sentences such as "A face red like a melon and a winter melon reflecting each other" on the blackboard before class. "Winter melon" meant fool. Yahong would always hang her head and shed tears when she saw it. In the sixth and seventh years of the Republic of China, she graduated from the normal school department. At that time, it was the era of absolutely virtuous mothers and good wives education, and feudal moral virginity concepts still permeated the world of educated women. Under these circumstances, Yahong had no other option but to be sad. When the wedding date arrived, she resigned from her teaching position and quietly returned, as if she were a little lamb going to the Taimiao Temple to be sacrificed, obediently being carried away by flowers and sedans. For more than ten years since then, she had suffered the abuse of her unreasonable husband, not allowed to read books or newspapers, not allowed to serve in society. She was only allowed to be idle in a lifeless, inactive home. Sometimes, if she slightly went against his wishes, he would use his fists and feet; Yahong would just grit her teeth and resign herself to fate. Recently, her plump and moderate figure was said to have become as thin as dry firewood, and she often coughed up bright red blood.</p>
<p>2.  Mad Baixian</p>
<p>Baixian was a talented woman in the early days of women's education. She struggled with her poor and helpless situation, graduated from a normal school in the country, and then went abroad to enroll in a university. Whenever overseas students gathered to discuss the problems of their motherland, one could often hear her passionate discussions. But since the thirteenth and fourteenth years of the Republic of China, her traces had disappeared. It turned out that the tide of love-supremacy had swept her into another world. She did not sink into sweet illusions, but rather became isolated from the crowd. The women's association she founded locally suffered a major blow because of this, with sighs of "If this person does not come out, what will happen to the association's affairs?" After several years, news suddenly came that she had failed in love, became a nun three times, and attempted suicide twice. Recently, a friend from Anhui said that her perception had been completely disordered, and she was only being protected by her relatives, living in a temple on a famous mountain. The changes in life are so dramatic! Recalling her initial departure abroad, how many aspirations she had for social issues—especially for women's issues—but now she was half-foolish and half-dazed, worse than the deer in the mountains! If her spirit could regain her previous clarity for just a moment, and she was told that someone had lost their entire soul for love, I think she would definitely have a reasonable evaluation. Who can not regret that she was too emotional and lacked reason when dealing with her own problems?</p>
<h3 id="e242">Futurist Dancing <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Juquan</p>
<p>Dancing is the expression of mankind's harmonious movements, and primitive humans already possessed this instinct. In ancient savage tribes, after successful hunts or victories in war, there was a kind of dancing to express joy. Later, as culture advanced, dancing became a kind of art. During the Renaissance, Medici promoted the art of dancing, and so dancing became very popular from then on. Now, in Europe, the most popular is the waltz. The waltz is a dance style of moving forward and backward, using three-beat music. The great musicians Johann and Strauso had specially composed for the waltz, so it was quite popular in European dance halls for a time.</p>
<p>Before the Great War, South American dances were popular in Paris, such as the Brazilian "Maxine" dance, the Argentine "Tango" dance, and the Paraguayan "Santate" dance, which some people called impressionist dances. Later, Cubism rose up, making dancing an independent art. Before, dancing was infused with music, but the new dance separated from music and occupied an independent position.</p>
<p>Now what we are going to talk about is Futurist dancing. Italian Futurist artists Marinetti and others recently published a Futurist dance (La Danse Futuriste) manifesto, advocating the application of the principles of Futurist art to dancing. In his manifesto, he begins by talking about the historical path of dance art. In primitive times, mankind's unknowable and immeasurable terror of the universe was expressed in dancing. Therefore, the dancing of savages mostly imitated celestial phenomena—the rotation of the sun and moon, the movement of stars. Later, as human culture advanced, dancing was gradually able to express the spontaneous movements of the human body. Futurism is vigorously praising material civilization, and mechanical movements are the elements of material civilization, so Futurism believes that what civilized people's dances should imitate is this kind of movement. Also, for the view of music, Futurism's claims are very unique. They believe that the music that has been used in the past is a kind of sick state of art, and the music used by Futurist dancing should not be music, but "noise"—the "noise" made by vibrating solid objects, liquids, or compressed gases. Because only this noise can express mankind's mechanical life. Futurist artist Luigi Rusoro invented instruments for making noise based on this principle for use in dancing.</p>
<p>Now let's give an example of a Futurist dance advocated by Marinetti. There is a kind of dance called Aviation, which is a dance that simulates the movements of aviation. A map of the earth is laid on the ground. Above it is hung a blue curtain, representing the sky. The dancers wear a propeller on their chest and a model of a monoplane on their heads. While dancing, they report the altitude of the flight, "Three hundred meters... five hundred meters..." Green mountain scenery is also placed on the stage, and the dancers must jump over the mountains. When dancing, the specially made instruments emit the sounds of storms. Sometimes electricity is even used to release electric sparks in the room to represent lightning.</p>
<p>In short, the main purpose of Futurist art methods is to oppose everything that is inherited. The dance art of the past was characterized by gentleness, harmony, evenness, and tranquility. Futurist dancing, on the other hand, takes violence, reversal, and agitation as its main purpose. Although this kind of dance is not very popular in continental Europe, and the general public does not welcome it very much, and there are many attacks, Futurism has clearly established a new style in various modern arts.</p>

<p>Unanimously Recognized as a Unique Tonic for Winter</p>
<p>Its Taste is Delicious, Appetizing, Invigorating, and Restores Weakness After a Severe Illness</p>
<p>Its Ability to Treat Lung Disease and Stomach Weakness is No Different from Ginseng</p>

<p>Has the Effect of Supplementing Weakness and Increasing Strength</p>
<p>Essential for Those Who Eat Little, are Busy with Affairs, and are Naturally Weak</p>
<p>Yuanxia Company's chicken juice is fresh, delicious, and rich. It contains a considerable amount of protein. In addition to promoting appetite and aiding digestion, it truly has the effect of supplementing weakness and increasing strength. It is very beneficial for those who are weak after illness, naturally deficient, and eat little and are busy with affairs. It is also operated by Chinese people, so I am always happy to introduce it.

<p>Upon receiving your letter and your company's chicken juice, I immediately inspected and applied it. It is indeed the best among domestic chicken juices.

<p>Young Chicken Juice is a Natural Health Tonic</p>
<p>Yuanxia's Products are Excellent in Color, Quality, and Ingredients</p>
<p>I have always advocated natural tonics, believing that we humans, with our inherent digestive abilities, do not need to rely on artificial products for assistance. Chicken eggs, chicken juice, etc., are all natural health products and are daily necessities for our purpose of staying healthy. The owner of Yuanxia agrees with this, so in recent years he has devoted himself to young chicken juice. After several studies, the quality has become more and more refined. The difference between Yuanxia's products and ordinary ones lies in preserving not only its color and taste but also its quality. (Seal)</p>

<p>Yuanxia's Production Methods are Both Suitable and Effective</p>
<p>This Kind of Domestic Product Should Be Promoted</p>
<p>With the rise of new medicine, foreign medicines flood the market. Chinese people are confused by the psychology of imported goods, which has become a habit, making domestic products unable to develop. In fact, most medicinal products still require large factories and precise equipment, which our country's pharmaceutical industry cannot achieve today. However, some tonics, dressings, injections, pills, etc., made by Chinese people themselves, are both suitable and effective. Yuanxia Company's young chicken juice is one example. It is hoped that people in society and colleagues in the medical field will promote it, so that the future of domestic products will hopefully have a chance. (Seal)</p>

<p>More Beneficial to the Body Than Foreign Goods</p>
<p>To Yuanxia Company: I have received your company's young chicken juice and, after testing it, learned that it is of excellent quality and thoroughly disinfected. It is very beneficial to the body and is actually better than imported products. I have already prescribed it to patients, and it has had great effects.

<p>Unlike Other Thick Young Chicken Juices with Preservatives</p>
<p>Yuanxia Company's young chicken juice is a natural tonic. It tastes delicious and is of excellent quality. It is extracted using chemical methods. I have given it to my patients, and it has always been relied upon to increase appetite and gain weight. Because of its freshness, it is far from comparable to the thick juices sold on the market that have added preservatives.

<h3 id="e255">Solving Three Difficulties of Winter Supplementation <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>By Zhang Ruwei</p>
<p>We work diligently throughout the year, depleting our essence and blood. Timely supplementation during the winter is an essential way to nourish life. However, there are three difficulties in choosing supplements, detailed below. I will also provide solutions based on my research, one by one, as follows.</p>
<p>Supplements are Often Greasy and Cause Many Problems</p>
<p>All kinds of supplements are often greasy. Taking them can cause stomach upset, constipation, and indigestion. The benefits are not seen, but the harms are numerous. Moreover, their tastes are bitter and astringent, and their smells are especially difficult to bear. For example, donkey-hide gelatin and yellow-lipped fish liver oil have a particularly fishy and foul odor that is difficult to approach. All are unpalatable, and the spleen and stomach easily stop digesting. However, "chicken extract" or "beef extract" provides sufficient nourishment and tastes palatable. Taking it increases appetite and has no drawbacks. It is most suitable for those who want to supplement but are afraid of taking medications.</p>
<p>Too Many Supplementation Procedures are Discouraging</p>
<p>There are too many procedures involved in various supplements: selection, purchase, distinguishing authenticity, matching ingredients, decoction, timely consumption, consulting a doctor, or daily injections. It is time-consuming and laborious, and the effects are very slow. This causes people to become discouraged and lack perseverance. As a result, they stop halfway, and no effects are seen in many cases. However, "chicken extract" and "beef extract" have been researched and produced under medical supervision. Taking them is convenient and requires no procedures.</p>
<p>Taking Too Much Supplementation Can Be Harmful</p>
<p>Taking supplements requires a specific daily dosage. If too much is taken, it is not only useless but will inevitably cause many drawbacks. For example, if someone has anemia and takes too many blood-tonifying products, it can turn into a congestion syndrome, making them prone to stroke and other conditions. However, "chicken extract" and "beef extract" have been researched by the medical community and are prescribed to be taken at one bottle per day. Its tonifying power is appropriate for the daily needs of one person.</p>

<p>Insomnia Cured by Taking Chicken Extract</p>
<p>People who are nutritionally deficient and frail are in a precarious situation in China. Its impact on the nation is like vermin. Nutritional deficiency means that the metabolism of the human body lacks certain elements and cannot be replenished, causing cells to lose their activity. Yuanxia Company's fresh young chicken extract is rich in vitamins and various nourishing ingredients that meet the needs of the human body. It is also affordable and conveniently available, meeting the conditions for popular nourishment. As a doctor and a journalist, I am concerned about the worries of the world and want to not know old age is coming. But my physical strength has become overwhelming. Taking Yuanxia young chicken extract has fortunately cured my palpitations and insomnia. I am particularly pleased that it can boost the fighting spirit of the Chinese people. I am happy to introduce it, not only to promote domestic goods.</p>

<h3 id="e271">A Romance Case <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Meicun</p>
<p>Every day, when I open the newspaper and look at the local news, I always find one or two articles about romance cases. Newspapers try their best to reveal these cases, so that people in society can be aware and not repeat the mistakes. Although romance is romantic, it always feels like an attention grab if it goes to court. Is it a business tactic? Even though imprisonment is for a limited term, the taste never feels as delicious as fish and meat. But because it is limited, risk-takers may want to try it out.</p>
<p>The characters in romance cases can be young or old. Recently, there was a news story about a 31-year-old unmarried woman who went to Suzhou to marry her lover. As a result, her father followed her to Suzhou and sued her husband in court for fraudulent marriage. There was another story about a Sichuan broker, so-and-so, who seduced a girl under the age of 16 and was sentenced to three years and six months in prison. They are all young guys in the stories. The plots of the affairs are ingenious in their own way. One has already been sentenced, and the other is still being resolved. It is not pretty to drag romantic friends into court.</p>
<p>If you want to be attractive, if you know what's good for you, then just go to Xizang Road (near the racecourse) or Route des Soeurs (near the Great World) to open your eyes. On the black-and-white signs hanging horizontally and vertically, you can recognize some saviors of romantic diseases. Then you can carry out your romance cases that can avoid litigation, which is relatively worthwhile. But then again, doing so is attractive, knowing what's good for you, and also considering the adults and gentlemen. It doesn't lose what they call personality. But not like this, you just have to watch the old actors perform last year. How meticulous his old man's layout, handsome and sensible, can take care of, but also grand, although it has caused a lot of newspaper criticism, but there is no imprisonment in court. Some say that with money and power, everything can be perfunctory? I think so too!</p>
<p>The affair between a country and another country can also be a warning. However, it's somewhat unreliable to have the League of Nations as our only judging court. It is clear that it is unreliable, but it is given to it to solve, only because of the magic of the other side's propaganda and power. The most appropriate expedient is to wait.</p>
<p>Finally, we must be grateful to the romantic young man who "does not love the country but loves the beauty" for creating such a major romantic karma.</p>

<p>If you were born with some strength, you wouldn’t obtain a privileged athlete in school. You can wear sports clothes with red ‘S’s swaggering to class, you can turn on the record player in the room during class, drink milk… you can pull out your fists and hit people, open your mouth and scold people. You can… In short, show that he is a "tycoon".</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>In schools, toilets and bathrooms are places of absolute freedom of speech. If you don't believe it, there are always a few sentences on the walls of the bathroom, such as "XXX is SP", "XXX is a thief", and "X principal is a big cannon".</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder and colder. So morning exercises became the most hated thing by students, but too much absence is very important for future graduation, then just ask someone to come on behalf of you, or make excuses for illness. The discerning physical education teacher will never investigate.</p>

<p>When serving food in the dining hall, you can prove that "might is greater than reason." As long as you are strong enough, you can snatch the rice spoon. It doesn't matter to him how long others have been standing to get their food.</p>

<p>I did a small statistic. That is, when Mr. × is giving a philosophy lesson, there are an average of thirteen "ha" sounds per minute when he is lecturing.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>There is a theorem in arithmetic that A + B = C. I think it can be changed into the most contemporary thing, that is, (love) + (leather) = death. Let me explain it: that is, two people love each other plus a leather coat, or leather wine. To put it harshly, it is a "flesh relationship", and finally the two commit suicide.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>If students constantly pull out their watches to check the time during class, it is enough to show that the teacher is not humorous or cannot attract students' attention.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult for students who are generally young masters and princes to concentrate on their studies. If you ask him what day of the week "Christmas" and "New Year's Day" are, and how many days off there are in school, they will definitely know.</p>

<p>Whenever there is a lecture in our school, if the person standing on the stage and gesticulating is a blonde, blue-eyed foreigner, then the stage will be as quiet as if there were no one there. But it's very different when we have a memorial week. There are fights, eating, reading novels… In short, it's a feast for the eyes.</p>

<p>I heard that a few days ago, a celebrity at sea held a ×× anniversary, and a certain important person sent a plaque. The cost of "porterage" alone was 5,000 yuan. I don't know how much was donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army?</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am an unfortunate person who has not received a complete education, a young man who is about to finish his apprenticeship. Since graduating from high school, my aspirations and my father's expectations were to continue to junior high, high school, and university, but the aristocracy of our country's education system, the economic downturn, and all kinds of environmental pressures everywhere caused my aspirations to study to encounter various obstacles. So in the end I had to take the path of dropping out of school. After dropping out of school, I sought help from relatives and friends to seek employment outside. About a few months later, thanks to the kindness of my relatives, I was recommended to learn the oil business in my county. After entering the store, I became terrified of my lack of knowledge; moreover, this company was established for about a year, and due to sluggish business and huge expenses, it closed down.丨Middle omitted丨</p>
<p>Later, after many twists and turns, I was loved by my closest relative who had recommended me earlier and asked me to work as an assistant accountant in his cotton yarn shop. It has been a year now, and I am still in his shop, waiting for a good opportunity. However, the precious time of our young people is passing by like an arrow leaving the string丨Knowledge has not progressed at all, how can we not sigh丨However, how can I get another opportunity to study in the future; satisfy my desire for knowledge; and embark on the path of light, but I am at a loss. Just when I was frowning, I suddenly saw your newspaper's sixtieth anniversary, and you specially opened the store clerk communication column to answer difficult questions for employees and apprentices in the industrial and commercial sectors. I don't dare to be presumptuous. I beg you to give me some wise advice.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Zhu Jinlin, December 6th</p>
<p>Editor's Note: It is truly the most painful thing in the world to have a very high desire for knowledge and not be satisfied. Zhu Jun's vexation is a natural phenomenon. However, in China today, under the conditions of this social economy on the verge of bankruptcy and the education system being so unsound, we are only discussing Shanghai, and I don't know how many tens of thousands of young people are in the same situation as Zhu Jun. Therefore, Zhu Jun's letter is specially published for discussion. In addition to offering a little bit of foolishness, I also hope that readers will actively participate and give opinions.</p>
<p>First: We feel that it is certainly best to be able to go to school to study, but if the environment does not allow it and there is no such opportunity, you can also study without going to school, because learning is a lifelong career, and books are as vast as the sea of smoke. If you rely solely on school, how much can you actually read? | Furthermore, there are many shortcomings in the current schools. Not to mention those that are poorly equipped or have a business flavor; even those that are better in the results have limited real benefits to students. Diligent students, graduating from college, at most only know the method of reading and the doorway of learning. If you want to achieve profound achievements, you still have to continue to work hard after graduation. How can you get it completely in school?</p>
<p>Second: If you want to have sufficient knowledge and increase your knowledge, it is certainly necessary to read; but books are just symbols that record people's thoughts and experiences or describe various things, and are not the "panacea" for solving all problems. If you don't have a good observation of society and a good understanding of things, just reading books will not only not help your knowledge, but will often make you more and more confused. The so-called "good readers can increase their wisdom, bad readers can increase their ignorance," is the reason. What's more, the universe is originally a book that encompasses everything, and there are still many things that have not been recorded artificially. If you rely solely on books to seek everything, then your mind will be too narrow.</p>
<p>The above two points seem too transcendent, but in reality, if we are willing to take a closer look, it is also very common sense. Zhu Jun has been confused by the arguments of ordinary people, which has led to extreme vexation: In my opinion, Zhu Jun's environment is not bad and there are many opportunities for self-study. Being an assistant accountant is much better than an ordinary apprentice. You may wish to devote one or two hours each day in your spare time to specialize in reading. Over the years, knowledge will increase invisibly. If you encounter something you don't understand, you can humbly ask others for advice. No one will not tell you. If you do this, although the progress is slow, if you can persevere and not fall into the problem of being hot for three days and cold for four days, you will eventually succeed one day.</p>
<p>Finally, I also hope that Zhu Jun and friends who have the same feelings as Zhu Jun will not be too pessimistic about the environment they are in now. You must know that there are many great philosophers or great writers in the world who have not received a full school education but have been successful. This is certainly related to special talents, but most of it is completely struggled out of difficulties.</p>
<p>But we deeply feel the universality of this problem, and hope that readers will express their opinions, which will be published in this column one after another. Now I will write this question again below: "How can store clerks, apprentices, or interns satisfy their desire for knowledge?"</p>

<p>— Tai Shou'ou</p>
<p>You might readily say that I am not spirited, but rather cruel and murderous. It is likely that the training my stepmother gave me was too special. From the moment I understood how to read, I knew how to fight to the death. I don't understand what things are worth cherishing. At any time and any place, I am always prepared to use my strength and blood to fight to the death with any enemy that is unfavorable to me or unsatisfactory to me. … Let me tell you more clearly: don't be afraid! Several times, I almost fought Dajing to the death because of the impulse of anger!</p>
<p>There is another story that I can tell you in passing, but, my dear little Pig Luo, don't have nightmares tonight!</p>
<p>At that time, I was still a very comfortable university student at Kou University. One early summer evening, a sudden commotion arose in the dormitory. The reason for the commotion was that our classmate Hong Shiguang had been beaten and injured. Hong Shiguang was a Jiangbei person with whom I had absolutely no emotional connection. His beating, just like someone dying on the street, was not enough to attract my attention, let alone elicit sympathy or comfort.</p>
<p>"This is truly outrageous! Hong Shiguang went to a certain car company as a customer to hire a car. Just because of one sentence, he offended their accountant, and was beaten so badly by more than a dozen car drivers! His right eye probably cannot be saved!"</p>
<p>"That certain car company relies on a foreign merchant's brand, so it's not easy to sue!"</p>
<p>The students spread and discussed the incident of Hong Shiguang's beating, as if it were news from society, gradually arousing my murderous intent. "Matters that cannot be remedied by law can only be resolved by fighting to the death." On one Saturday night, harboring this idea that did not shy away from the stench of bloodshed, I filled myself with old wine and hid a sharp short axe. Without taking a car, I found a certain car company on foot. The weather was hot at the time, and a group of rogue-like car drivers, all with different arrogant airs, gathered at the entrance of the car company to cool off. No one would have noticed me.</p>
<p>"Aiya!" A big, burly shoulder was the first to come into contact with my sharp axe. Seeing that I came fiercely, they all raised benches, bamboo brooms, and wooden sticks, and surrounded me. There were at least twenty strong men. I acted as if I didn't see them, didn't say a word, and like a mad tiger, I just chose the places where there were many people to chop and ram, my fists and elbows, benches, crashed on my body, more powerless than paper, I simply didn't feel any pain.</p>
<p>The shouts of killing alarmed the street patrolmen, who rushed in to mediate. The other side immediately abandoned their armor and stopped fighting, while my sharp axe was still flying in the wide car park.</p>
<p>Partly relying on the imposing manner of the suit I was wearing, and partly thanks to the drunken state that reddened my face, the two patrolmen not only did not send me to the Western prison in Tilanqiao, but also carefully helped me, called a rickshaw for me, and sent me off with great respect.</p>
<p>As soon as I got into the car, I was very proud. I rubbed my empty hands together, secretly celebrating the victory tonight. The car pulled halfway, and the night wind slowly woke me up: head, shoulders, legs... there was no place without alarm bells, it turned out that I was covered in wounds! In the end, I also discovered my weapon, the sharp axe, had been confiscated by the police officers.</p>
<p>Three months of lonely illness on a sickbed in Baolong Hospital was the result of this "seeing injustice on the road and drawing a knife to help." Hong Shiguang never knew about this.</p>
<p>Savage? Children! Cruel? To be honest, I myself have not failed to realize it, but I can't change it!</p>
<p>Thank God! All thanks to him for giving me this blood that is brave to fight to the death, so that today, I can finally endure the pain of infinite sacrifice, voluntarily give up you, the you that is on my mind day and night, abandon a promising future, move my old father and orphans, and my most pitiful wife, and go alone to face the muzzle of my enemy that I have hated for more than ten years - the Japanese beast army!</p>
<p>If anyone is arrogant enough to place the titles of "patriot" or "martyr" under my name, then I can only be ashamed and cannot accept it. Because this time I am abandoning my pen to join the army and devote myself to the country is, undeniably, to preserve your reputation and happiness. Sacrificing for the country is just a way to embellish the posthumous glory! Therefore, you don't have to pity me, or be sad about it, just enjoy all the material pleasures that your Dajing offers you!</p>
<p>On the day I left, a day when it was raining heavily, the idea of seeking death was decided. At lunchtime, I specially changed into the newest suit that you thought was the most beautiful, and carefully tied a bright tie. After carefully shaving my beard, I poured and combed it with a type of hair oil with the strongest fragrance, and combed the two rows of hair as flat as if they were drawn in black ink. After dressing up so comfortably, I lingered in front of the mirror of the wardrobe for a while. "I really don't know which lucky bullet will end the life of such a handsome and outstanding young man!" I suddenly had a whimsical idea, and very happily thought to myself.</p>

<h3 id="e279">Recent News of Lillian Gish <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Jianan</p>
<p>Movie fans who have watched movies for three or four years will not forget Lillian Gish, who is known for her tragic roles in Hollywood. She doesn't have the beauty of Billie Dove, the sweetness of Nancy Carroll, the heat of Clara Bow, nor the mystery of Garbo, but when the films she stars in are screened in any theater, they are always full to the brim and a sensation. In her previous silent films such as "Broken Blossoms," "The Scarlet Letter," and "The Wind," her silent, tragic, posture and expression have earned the sympathetic tears of many men and women. But since the advent of sound films, her fame seems to have been blown clean by Vitaphone. She is not like Chaplin, who opposes sound films, nor is it because her voice is not good, because she had a very successful performance in the stage play "Uncle Vanya" performed in New York. Recently, in the sound film "Romantic Nights," which was screened at the Shanghai Grand Theater, she also received considerable praise. Her temporary return to the field was originally due to dissatisfaction with the conditions set by the bosses. It is said that in the contract with MGM, she asked for a weekly salary of $8,000, which the company did not agree to, so she turned her head and returned to her hometown.</p>
<p>After years of hard work, she has some savings. There is no need to worry about future life. But she never forgets her love for the art of drama. She often studies facial expressions, simple movements, and correct postures in front of the mirror. In addition to socializing in the local social circles, she often accepts theater appointments to perform on stage. This is not a reaction to the end of the road, but an opportunity for her to develop her personality and maintain her glory.</p>
<p>Recently, she also performed "Camille" in Central City, Colorado. It is a famous French work, which has been introduced to us twice in films by Valentino and Ramon Novarro. This time, relying on Lillian Gish's talent and experience, her success on stage is certain.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the old bosses in Hollywood are jealous again. Contract negotiations are brewing again, and perhaps both parties will compromise a little. Let's prepare to welcome her.</p>

<h3 id="e280">"Downstairs" Movie Review <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>John Gilbert has almost lost all his former glory since the popularity of sound films. "His Glorious Night" was a sound film, but not only was the sound not welcome, but his performance skills seemed to be inferior to the silent era. He hoped to restore his reputation, so he first wrote a novel, assuming himself to be the protagonist in the book. Sure enough, Americans had a much better impression of him. After that novel was made into this film "Downstairs," he almost regained his former status.</p>
<p>"Downstairs" is being screened at the Carlton. We who usually love him, of course, want to see what is going on, but unfortunately, he can't give us the satisfaction we imagined!</p>
<p>John carefully changed his style. The character he played is not the amorous and gentle gentleman of the past. He plays a treacherous and unrighteous servant. This point may be considered a success, because he is very suitable for his role and can fully express the personality of a bad man who disguises and deceives women. His vicious inner heart and kind appearance make people understand what he is doing now. His better plan is to use second-rate actors for all the supporting roles and put all the important performances on himself. In this way, a very long film has become his solo performance, and of course it is much easier to please people.</p>
<p>The plot is very tense, and it is also very reasonable and realistic. The structure of the film can also be regarded as acceptable. The photography helped John a lot with his wonderful performances. The light is a bit too dark overall. Perhaps he did it on purpose to describe the "downstairs"?</p>
<p>The supporting roles are all good. Paul Lukas can even steal the show in some places. The two female roles are very mediocre. If the play is acted as a play, it will naturally be overdone or reveal falsehood. Many people on the cast list only appear for a few hundred feet in the film, so there is nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>This time, what is satisfactory is the sound, which has made earth-shattering progress compared to John's previous sound films.</p>
<p>In short, the silent John gave us a very good impression. We have too high hopes for his sound films. Otherwise, if this film were starred by someone else, it could be regarded as a masterpiece, which could satisfy us very much!</p>
<p>"Kismet," originally named "Fate and Luck," but later renamed "Golden Dream," is now being screened at the Cathay. The content describes the naked palace in a vivid and thorough way. The grandeur of the setting is especially amazing. The picture below is one of them.</p>

<h3 id="e281">Research on Tone Deafness <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Tone deafness can make movie stars not recognize their own voices on the screen. This is why many male and female stars are surprised when they first hear the sound coming out of the film.</p>
<p>"My voice sounds very unnatural," or "This doesn't sound like my voice at all." It is said that when Paramount previewed "Blonde Venus," the male lead of this film, Herbert Marshall, did not recognize his own voice. Although he had filmed several sound films, he said that he always felt unaccustomed to hearing the sound coming out of the film.</p>
<p>At the same time, Broadway stage star and Genevieve Tobin's sister, Vivian Tobin, also had such an experience. She is now playing a Roman prostitute named Dacia in Cecil B. DeMille's film "The Sign of the Cross." When she previewed the film, she heard her voice coming out of the film for the first time. She said, "If this voice is supposed to be my own voice, I really can't believe it myself." But the people in the screening room said that her voice was very accurate.</p>
<p>Hansen, the head of Paramount's sound department, gave the following explanation for this contradiction:</p>
<p>"Almost everyone is somewhat tone deaf to his or her own voice." When talking, he hears his own voice through a kind of body vibration and eardrum vibration, but the voice he hears from the film only has eardrum vibration and no body vibration.</p>
<p>John Gilbert's masterpiece "Downstairs" is being screened at the Carlton starting yesterday. This play was originally conceived by Gilbert himself, and there are many wonderful things in it. The picture below is one of the scenes.</p>
<p>Reader Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e282">Talking about "Old Hatred and New Sorrow" <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Ailian</p>
<p>The debut work "Old Hatred and New Sorrow" of the three pillars of the Star Company - Li Pingqian, Ai Xia, and Sun Min - is indeed much more satisfactory than the previous products of the Star Company. The script is very well written, and there are also commendable points in the directing techniques.</p>
<p>Synopsis: A young military officer has a love affair with his uncle's concubine. Later, the young man leaves alone and wanders for eighteen years. One day he looks back and returns to his uncle's house, but the concubine has already died. He still lives in the old house and teaches his cousin earnestly. Unexpectedly, the cousin's love buds bloom, and he is extremely painful and has no choice but to pretend to be crazy, forcing his cousin to transfer her love to another young man.</p>
<p>Director: Li Pingqian's skill is not weak and far better than the old-fashioned people like Zheng Zhengqiu. For example, the beginning is the young man's debauchery in the ballroom, and then a photo reminds him of the old things of eighteen years ago, and then a train is conjured from a letter, reflecting "Wandering for seventeen years since then" are all unique and always tense.</p>
<p>Actors: Gong Jianong's performance is very profound; Ai Xia first plays the uncle's concubine, which is very mediocre; later she plays the cousin, which is just right. Sun Min plays another young man, which is a bit of a waste of talent. Zhu Qiushui is still suitable for his role. The subtitles are half good and half bad. The music composed by the Central Orchestra is not bad.</p>
<p>Conclusion: In today's domestic films, it can be regarded as a masterpiece. I would like to ask everyone to watch it out of enthusiasm for maintaining domestic films.</p>

<h3 id="e283">Crying Without Breathing Help <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>After laughing, we are now going to cry.</p>
<p>Crying is easier than laughing. We can cry when we are first born. Is it still necessary to spend effort to discuss and practice it?</p>
<p>But if you have a little experience in the photography studio or on the stage, you will definitely know that the expression of crying is more difficult to make than laughing. In a large photography studio, I don't know how much film is wasted every year on this simple expression that everyone can't do. "Miss Zhang! Mr. Li! Those two crying shots of yours have to be reshot tomorrow! Because after printing it out and looking at it, this time it looks like laughter!" This disappointing announcement is often heard even by the most experienced famous stars in the photography studio. Small companies cannot reshoot unsatisfactory shots due to economic constraints. As a result, they have no choice but to cut off a few feet. The most important film in the whole film is just because the protagonist's crying looks like laughter.</p>
<p>Now you first try crying in front of the mirror without breathing help. The first thing that changes naturally is your eyebrows. Many people may think that frowning is crying. This is how crying looks in our old operas.</p>
<p>The second thing that changes is your lips. When crying, the lips often droop, the upper lip stretches slightly downwards, and the lower lip and chin hang down, lengthening the entire face.</p>
<p>The muscles of the face are completely in a crying state. But it still doesn't look like crying. Because your eyes always seem to be smiling there.</p>
