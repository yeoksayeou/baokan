<p>時評</p>
<h3>日軍果能抑止世界一致之輿論乎</h3>
<p>彬</p>
<p>日軍此次在上海决然掀起震搣世界之戰禍其所持之口實一爲保僑一爲制止抗日運動戰禍爆發已近一月保僑之結果何如乎制止抗日運動之結果又何如乎換言之即彼恃其暴力悍然所顧忌日以侵略中國爲事者其所領受之教訓已彰彰可覩也</p>
<p>日本乘世界凋敝列强不遑外顧我國又正苦於洪水惨災之隙决然以暴力佔取我東北不足復企圖攻取我吳淞把持上海港口以掌握壟斷上海富庶之市塲其用心早爲世人所共見而猶假其名曰保僑迨其結果非特愈保僑而僑愈不安且反造成中日兩民族間巨大之裂痕更不覺悟復欲一意孤行於所謂公理正義世界和平國際信義等都悍然無所顧惜吾人與其謂爲日本軍閥之胆大母寗謂其侵略野心之勃發已掩蔽其一切理性</p>
<p>日本旣以暴力激起我國之抗日運動復欲以暴力抑制之其所恃者除暴力外一無所有所考慮者除侵略外亦一不措意然而戰幕揭開曲直分明公理之所在終爲勝利之所歸正義容能爲强暴所掩蔽斷不至爲强暴所呑没吾人於此益確信而無疑</p>
<p>據最近消息華盛頓朝野上下都主張對日予以懲創對日經濟封銷已成爲輿論之中心英倫人士有人主張會同美國立即共同裁制日本自由黨尤力主對日實行裁制孟却斯德指導報并痛詆國聯諸政治家太無胆量不敢試行裁制轉以自困其他如挪威如西班牙如南美各邦都一致謂日本藐視聯盟理事會之迭次勸告攻擊上海力主引用九國條約非戰條約以及其他有關係之各條約至於國際聯盟日前旣已對日提出警告近更有舉行特會决定採取盟約第十六條對日實行經濟制裁之計劃世界輿論顯然已一致傾向於反日共同對日經濟制裁雖是否可能實現尙難决斷而有此趨向則爲事實中國抗日日則實施暴力以抑止之在此種選輯之下今世界人士都深憤日軍之横暴主張予日以制裁則日軍不亦將奮其全力向世界興問罪之師耶</p>
<p>日政府二十二日覆國聯文謂我國騷亂内戰不時發生不能視爲有組織之國家故國聯會章不適用於我國夫旣不認我爲有組織之國家何以列國容許我爲搆成國聯之一分子而與彼自詡爲有組織之日本同列於國際之林故無論此種措詞忽視國際禮節徒以自損其立國之信譽即就日本地位言亦不過證明其爲幸災樂禍乘人之危以滿足自己之貪慾而已有組織之國家固應日以攻取他國之領土爲事耶日人之强詞奪理可謂已至其極然而世界愛護公理之人士果遂能爲其所朦蔽耶</p>
<p>我國今已站立於公理與强暴之戰之最前綫毅然負起維護公理之鉅責自一月二十八日以來我國軍隊之英勇抗暴爲維護我民族之生存亦所以對世界對全人類作偉大之貢獻世人士必能予我以多大之同情以共維此世界共同之公理</p>
<p>潰退敵軍尙圖掙扎</p>
<h3>金穆宅殘敵昨仍在圍擊中吳淞閘北昨日無劇烈戰事</h3>
<p>閘北自前晚激戰後、我軍陣線、已展至福生路虬江路大德里横濱橋等處吳淞敵軍單薄故昨無劇戰、惟江灣金穆宅殘敵昨尙在圍擊中、今日當可解决也茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<h3>江灣方面戰况</h3>
<p>廟行鎭昨又血戰竟日　　激戰結果斃敵二千餘日軍前日起、總攻廟行鎭、被我軍全部擊潰後、敵二萬餘人、狼奔豖突、死傷在三千人以上、詳情已誌昨報前晚九時、我軍乘勝追擊時、並將敵二千餘人、全部包圍於廟行鎭迤南十里許之金穆宅侯家木橋附近、詎於是晚十二時、敵敗退之先頭部隊、業已接得被圍報告、乃聯絡殘敵一萬五千餘人、一方並報告日司令部、遣派援軍五千餘名、前往馳救敵軍得此生力、又竭力反攻、以期援救被圍敵軍出險、吾軍方面遂調遣一部份士卒迎擊敵軍、一部則仍將敵軍包圍、激戰異常激烈、戰至昨日午後二時半、敵死傷二千餘人、勢漸不支、其應援之部隊、遂完全崩潰、被我包圍之敵、今日可完全解决、詳情分誌如下、</p>
<h3>廟行血戰竟日</h3>
<p>離廟行迤南</p>
<p>十里餘之金穆宅侯家木橋地方、前晚十一時許、即有日軍大部二千餘人、被吾包圍、乃日軍司令部得悉、即派大批援軍、連同潰退士卒、向吾作猛烈之反攻、敵軍坦克車卅餘輛、鐵甲車二十餘輛、頑强當先、冀將吾軍衝破以期援被圍之敵軍出險、上役敵軍、因本國軍隊被圍在内、不克施放大砲、祗恃機槍槍刺與吾作猛烈之肉搏、吾軍口師、當即分撥一部份士卒、約計五千餘名、與之應戰、大刀隊機槍連迫擊砲連等均調赴前方、參加戰役、吾軍當時、前後首尾銜接、重以敵軍顧慮被圑士卒、未能充分發揮其砲火利器、故吾軍雖以少敵多、殊佔優勢、惟當淸晨四時許、敵軍因反攻仍復不利、由日司令部電命海軍艦隊派飛機多架、飛往吾軍陣地、猛烈擲彈、且由空中發射機槍、並開機關砲、吾軍頗受危迫、時吾駐防江灣東鎭之某部、得悉戰報、立即乘曉霧未淸之際、由敵軍左翼包抄、予以迎頭痛擊、敵軍前鋒、乃呈不支、於昨日上午十時許、反攻敵軍後退約三里許、於是被圍敵軍與反攻敵軍、完全被吾隔絕、不能呼應、惟敵軍因此舉關於戰局、殊爲重大、始終猛烈衝攻、吾軍則亦以一當十、爭先殺敵、相持至昨日下午三時三十分、敵死傷二千餘人、勢漸不支、其應援之部隊、遂完全崩潰、至被圍敵軍二千餘名、仍頑强抵抗、據前方軍事長官表示、今日必可完全解决、</p>
<h3>江灣獲敵機槍</h3>
<p>江灣方面、</p>
<p>爲敵軍第九師圑左翼、於昨日午刻、並出第九十兩聯隊、向我陣地進攻、我軍於敵軍進至三百米逹外、以大隊衝出、敵軍見我人數較衆、有迫不得已而應戰者、有見勢兇猛棄械而逃者、未及一小時、我已衝至戰壕、當奪取機關槍兩架、並斃敵軍第九聯隊隊長西尾少尉、及兵士森山山本等近百人之衆云、</p>
<h3>日司令部地點</h3>
<p>敵軍前敵司</p>
<p>令部、本設在復旦大學内、昨日起、移設於江灣跑馬塲之東北角、關帝廟之對面、附近民房被焚燬一空、</p>
<h3>運出大批日屍</h3>
<p>日軍自連日</p>
<p>向我總攻失敗後、據我方精密調查、日軍死傷人數、確在萬人以上、除遺棄陣地、未及搶回者外、即公大紗廠内堆積之日軍屍首已逹三千餘具、死傷之多、實打破自有戰事以來之新紀錄、昨日上午九時許、日方軍事當局、派出輜重兵一帶約三十餘人、監督楊樹浦碼頭我方小工、及被捕難民、約六七十人、用卡車十二輛、往公大紗廠搬運日軍屍首、該項屍首、均以蔴袋装好、每袋二人、外用蔴繩綑好、一卡車約載五十餘個蔴袋、陸續運往停泊在楊樹浦碼頭之一日方商輪上、前後往返共計三次、總計屍首約三千餘具、至下午二時後、始將公大紗廠内之屍首搬完、據昨日被日方壓迫而作此項工作之某工人云、公大紗廠内、流血成渠、腥臭撲鼻、有傷重之日兵、猶在地上掙扎、但已不能言語、慘悽之狀、目不忍覩、但此項將死未死之傷兵、亦經在旁監督之輜重兵、囑令装入蔴袋、故當我（工人自稱）掮該蔴袋掮上卡車時、日傷兵尙在袋中蠕動云、</p>
<h3>日軍慘殺華人</h3>
<p>觀戰西人不忍卒覩</p>
<p>大美晚報主筆蕯格萊君、星期一（二十二）自江灣日軍前綫觀戰、目擊日軍慘無人道之暴行、茲譯其原文如下、予今日視察江灣跑馬塲、歸而不能無動乎中、以前所見賽馬盛况、中外仕女、熙來攘往、在日光明媚下作競馬之戲、今晨所見、片慘毒而已、予入塲處陳屍纍纍、皆予所目擊、其慘死者、日軍司令部官報、常謂爲伏兵成爲間牒、是耶否耶、予不欲置辯但其中有婦女焉、有孩童焉、婦女彈從背射入、所着棉衣、亦爲單刀所洞穿、孩童滿身彈痕、鄉農装朿者亦積屍於地、地爲血染、若輩服装、不類軍人、婦女孩童、更無論矣、意者此即官方所認爲伏兵耶、蓋司令部及日使館中人、常告我力說日本海陸軍非對平民作戰、亦非對中國政府或政府軍隊作戰、僅與廣東之十九路軍作戰而已、是則此輩無辜良民、當爲十九路軍所喬装者、惟死者已矣、今安從起而爲之對證耶、屋字被焚比比皆是、更爲予所目覩，日軍縱火、手術精妙、無出其右、看臺下焚餘之殘體在焉、予步上看臺、見步兵一隊、準備向江灣鎭肉搏、亦駐足與予同觀慘劇、其時農舍正在焚燒、火光熊熊、成爲被虜之火裹逃生者之佈景、一軍官牽、農装者離羣、向日光下站立、但見軍刀一閃、刺入人體、深及刀柄、而其人倒地矣、如是者一人復一人、更有身長而可愛之童子、日軍解脫其縛、强按兩屍問、面俯地、日軍官六手槍齊發、自背而下、彈痕纍纍、槍聲息、彈子罄、轉側地上之人、旋亦不動、另一人繼遭同樣命運、予不忍更觀、遂行、昨日該報著有社評、痛論此事、其言曰、上海之事、日本名爲［防衛］、若然、則爲暴行防衛、爲日本製造之戰爭、若然、則眞正防衛、似須家破人亡也、</p>
<h3>閘北方面戰况</h3>
<p>昨晨殘敵襲擊即敗退</p>
<p>前晚砲彈掠過日領署</p>
<p>日軍自迭次總攻失敗、前晚又經我軍壓迫、實已潰不成軍、故昨日無重大戰事、我軍前綫已逹虹鎭、老靶子路一帶、已無日軍踪跡、其殘部均在海寗路吳淞路一帶、並在外虹橋至裹虹橋一帶、收集殘部</p>
<h3>傅家國師長</h3>
<p>（攝江洗）</p>
<p>、加築防禦工程、昨晨四時許、日軍一小部份殘兵、約三百餘人、曾一度重向我軍前綫襲擊、未幾仍潰退、閘北方面、北四川路一帶、於拂曉及昨晚六時許、亦有小接觸、茲將昨日閘北戰情分誌於次、</p>
<h3>殘敵襲擊敗退</h3>
<p>昨晨四時許</p>
<p>、日軍殘部約三百餘名、於全部潰退時、突又回來、向北四川路口我軍陣綫、猛烈反攻、初以大砲猛轟、我軍間亦略加還擊、砲戰至六時許、三百餘日軍、忽由集合綫而變作散兵綫、藉坦克車之掩護、向我軍衝鋒、我軍當即迎頭痛擊、以手溜彈機關槍等、向其猛烈掃射、立將在日軍左當作掩護之坦克車兩輛擊燬、斃敵百餘人、餘衆見勢不佳、亟反身向後潰退、以坦克車兩輛、在後掩護、斯時我軍精神百倍、跟踪追擊、又將日方坦克車兩輛加以炸燬、一部份落後、日軍六十餘人、見我軍來勢勇猛、驚惶失措、即將槍抛棄而退、是役也、交戰約三時有餘、計擊敗日軍坦克車四輛、奪獲步槍七十餘支、機關槍一架、斃敵百餘人、我軍則僅則僅傷五六人、</p>
<h3>前晚虹口狀况</h3>
<p>前（二十二）</p>
<p>晚九時許、日兵大敗混亂潰退、我軍逼近北河南路三角小菜塲時、一般匿居北四川路·崑山路·虹口·等處之日僑因我軍砲火急迫、難以再躱避、遂由槍林彈雨中、均頭頂棉被、從外白渡橋向南而逃者、如飛湧而來、故一時沿黃浦灘之台灣銀行·正金銀行·日本郵船會社等四週人行道上、及各行門首石階上、席地而坐之日僑民、竟有人山人海之槪、一種驚皇狼狽之狀、實非筆墨所能形容、</p>
<h3>目睹閘北敗敵</h3>
<p>昨據由北河</p>
<p>南路寳興里河南旅社内奔避出來之旅客其君爲、當前晚日軍三四百名、於八時許、自新民路來安里進窺北站時、渠適寓在臨街房間、由玻窗中窺見日軍蜂湧而進、均用機關槍迫擊砲衝錄、同時敵軍砲隊亦發砲掩護、我軍始終寂然、不發一槍、日軍繼續向寳山路北車站前進、約有三四百步後、我軍機關槍步槍密起、日軍先頭隊應聲而倒者二十餘人、即中止進衝、我軍即於斯時、一躍出戰壕、及防禦工程、向敵反攻、日軍紛向原路而逃、被我軍截成二段、一部乃改向北四川路方面奔潰、一部於逃至北河南路口、見去路上早有我軍抵禦、乃衝向該處租界栅門口、爲該處守衛美兵所見、亟放槍示威、殘敵乃反身向新民路突圍、結果生還者無幾、我軍即於斯時、向老靶子路追逼云</p>
<h3>出雲艦險中彈</h3>
<p>大陸報云、</p>
<p>昨日（二十二日）午夜前、北站附近開砲轟擊日旗艦出雲、在一小時半間、共有七十彈、飛過日領事署屋頂而入浦江、距出雲艦不過咫尺、至十二時三十分、見出雲旗艦已升火‘料正準備移泊他處云、</p>
<h3>北四川路近况</h3>
<p>記者昨日冒險視察</p>
<p>我軍陣綫有新發展</p>
<p>記者昨日下午曾至北河南路、意欲至寳山路老靶子路口、視察北四川路一帶情况、但僅能進抵愛而近路口美軍二道防綫爲止、以北即係危險地點、同時亦因美軍阻止前進、未能如願、嗣乃設法繞道至老靶子路南首之某弄内、始獲一覩老靶子路至北四川路之實在情形、原在老靶子路口（即唐紹儀宅前）築防之日兵、已完全折退、但沿路向東直至北四川路爲止、旣不見日軍、亦不見我軍、但聞靠近北四川路方面之步槍聲與機關槍聲、時起時輟、據該處住民稱、昨日（二十二日）老靶子路日兵來往甚多、至晚間八時餘、被我軍北面衝出擊退、當日軍退却時、北河南路之美軍、曾開機關槍、日軍被迫退往北四川路及海寗路以東、我軍將老靶子路日軍擊退後、仍退守福生路附近華界一帶、又據由北四川路以東逃出者稱、虬江路大德里至横浜橋一帶、均有我軍防守云云、詢以横浜橋以北係何方軍防守、答稱不知記者復折回向南行至海寗路再向朝東進抵新愛倫影戲院前時、見北四川路東首路口築有沙包、並有日軍陸戰隊數名防守、行人甚少、記者再欲前進時、醫院門前某君即謂、不能朝東、因日軍時時開槍或捕人、尤其對於着西装者格外注意、記者乃折回北河南路南行沿蘇州路至四川路橋、見北堍有日兵五六名防守、並據附近住民稱、天潼路口並架有機關槍一尊、行人經過、必須檢查云</p>
<h3>吳淞方面戰况</h3>
<p>敵艦開砲虚張聲勢</p>
<p>敵抄楊行中途擊退</p>
<p>敵軍因趨重於廟行鎭方面、故吳淞一帶、昨日敵艦除照例向我開砲及擲彈外、並無激烈戰事、蕰藻浜正面之敵軍、有時亦有小隊進犯但隨時均被我軍擊退、惟前日我方曾乘敵軍兵力稀薄時、改取攻勢、頗爲得手、茲將昨日所得戰况、紀錄如下</p>
<h3>泗漕廟殲滅日軍</h3>
<p>昨晨十時、</p>
<p>駐紮南泗塘河西徐港黑橋等處、有日軍一隊、約八十餘名、迫該處某鄉民爲引導、向西擬兜過胡家莊、直逹至楊行、不料爲駐紮季家橋南孫家宅三其宅之我軍瞥見、當時均不動聲色、躱避於戰壕内或民房中及樹林間、俟敵軍過去、再行截擊、敵以爲該處並無我軍直向　行過三其宅、已抵泗漕廟時、我軍從其後背突出、開放步機關槍掃射日軍知已中計、拼命冲圍、因我軍奮勇圍擊、敵歸路已斷、劇戰約四十分鐘、援軍不至、故將敵軍全部解决、同時蕰草浜周家浜口之日軍、用砲向北轟擊、將永安第二廠房屋轟毁、旋經我軍開機關槍掃射、敵遂不支而退、</p>

<h3>前日兩外報紀載</h3>
<p>昨日本埠　　字林報泰晤士報等對於二十二日戰事、載日軍司令部消息、猶稱日方勝利、諱言失敗、惟大陸報載日軍總司令植田中將前日傍晚、在無綫電中報告、已承認日軍失敗、聲稱、『本日下午、中國軍隊在廟行鎭開始猛烈進攻、我軍（日軍）爲避免重大損失計、遂於二時許退却、迄今我方死傷人數、就余所知、士兵一百十人、官長九人』、蓋是日戰事、據大陸報所載日軍司令部消息、侵晨五時半、日軍兩縱隊向廟行鎭進發、八時開始攻擊、中國軍隊略事抵抗、中央陣綫即行退却、日軍不知是計、向前猛進、方慶敵人無甚抵抗、乃至十一時許、中國軍隊左右翼進而包圍、截斷日軍退路、中國軍隊猛攻、日軍不支主力軍於下午三時退却、前進之一千餘人、遂陷入重圍、至下午五時許、據中國司令部消息除極少數逸出外、餘悉爲華軍解决、至於退却之日軍、一隊八千人、退回引翔鄉整理另一隊七千人、欲退回蕰藻浜、行至金穆宅、復與中國軍隊相遇、至晚間十時、猶在激戰中、觀此情形、在正午以前、日軍方自以爲大勝、西報所得、大槪係屬此時消息、遂致與是日戰事結果、大相逕庭也、</p>

<h3>日艦昨午又藉外輪掩護作戰</h3>
<p>漢陽輪進口時之危險　　日海軍欲移禍於外輪　　自日艦砲攻吳淞、屢次失敗以來、近因長我方砲火、不敢駛近吳淞砲火線内、往來於上海淞口間之敵艦、常利用外商輪船之進出、追隨掩蔽、更藉商輪之障護、對我吳淞砲台發砲、本月二十日下午一時半、太古武昌輪由長江來滬、進口之時、日艦二艘、利用武昌輪掩護、對我陣地、放二十餘砲、至二十二日該行鄱陽輪、自漢口抵滬、在駛進吳淞之際、又有日艦二艘、藉該輪之障蔽、對我砲台發十八砲、我方恐累及無辜傷害外輪、故始終未予回砲、詎昨日太古漢陽輪進口、日艦又利用商船掩蔽、對我砲台發砲猛轟矣、茲將漢陽輪經過情形、分述如下、</p>
<h3>漢陽候潮抛淞</h3>
<p>太古漢陽輪、自香港來滬、昨日上午十一時、駛抵吳淞口外、因潮水低落、抛錨守候、附近石頭砂海面、抛有日本魚雷艦六艘、砲艦一艘、至下午二時左右、吳淞口外海潮大漲、可以通航、漢陽輪便拔錨開行、駛入浦江、</p>
<h3>日艦兩艘偷航</h3>
<p>漢陽輪在吳淞外開行、駛進浦江之際、停在石頭砂日艦七艘、中有魚雷艇二艘、一爲二十二隊、一爲二十六隊、鑒漢陽開船、彼亦駛來、追踵而行、將近吳淞時、兩日艦便開足速率、趕到漢陽船畔、同時移砲位装砲彈、實行其藉商船掩護、發砲轟我砲台、</p>
<h3>發砲轟擊砲台</h3>
<p>將抵吳淞口、兩日艦以最速之馬力超越漢陽輪、即在商輪之前、對我吳淞砲台轟擊、一連猛開七砲、日艦所以冒到漢陽以前者、完全借後尾英商輪船的掩蔽、使我砲台不敢回砲、即使回擊、其着彈當在漢陽船上、其手段之惡毒、行爲之卑鄙、實欲移禍於外人耳</p>
<h3>我方容忍未發</h3>
<p>在兩日艦超前開砲時、漢陽船主大驚、以日海軍此種行爲、顯欲加禍於無辜的商船、並欲藉商船的障衛、使華軍無法　擊、如此行爲、實使上海各國商輪、陷於極危險的地位、漢陽急以全速率開進吳淞、幸我砲台守軍容忍、始終未回一彈、兩日艦開到砲火線外、便即停行、漢陽輪於三時半進口、船主到滬、已將此事報告該行矣、</p>
<h3>萬國紅會質問日本</h3>

<p>將設法使中日停戰</p>
<p>倫敦外相西門較昨晚路透社所傳啓程赴日内瓦鐘點早二十四小時首途、乃因接日内瓦消息、其他四列强代表均已集於該處、將於明日舉行國聯總委員會會議之故、英國在日内瓦所抱政策第一目的、爲後此數日内、設法使中日停戰、惟德賠欵與軍縮問題、亦爲其所注重、英國之意見、如國聯不能使兩停戰、以得永久之解决、則所釀成之局勢、將危及國聯之地位、及各民族對國聯信任之度量、今尤望此種努力、不爲幕後陰謀所損害、外間雖有此種流言、但據英當局所接消息觀之、實未之有也、路透電社從最可靠方面探悉、英國之政策、將仍爲在最早可行之時機、以最有效力之方法、從事斡旋、以安定遠東之和平、英國抱此目的、準備與美國在國聯外合作、或與國聯内任何列强合作、凡能影響國聯充分盡責之途徑、决不由之、且中日兩國今皆力避承認戰爭之存在、雙方雖已開戰、而均稱之爲爭端、外交關係、仍未斷絕、此亦停戰希望之所在也、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>對遠東事件</p>
<h3>美將發新宣言</h3>
<p>重申門户開放等原則</p>
<p>備將來對日外交圭臬</p>
<p>（華盛頓）近有人建議於美國國務院、美國對於遠東事件、應以中國最近之事變爲根據、發表一種普遍之宣言、現此事正在國務卿史汀生氏熟慮之中、并據極可靠方面消息、美國確將有一種宣言發表、惟並不提出何種新方式或激烈之策略僅將美國歷來已經施行之原則如門户放等題目、重新加以標明、深信美國此之宣言、將從重新施用原有之方針想、該項原有之方針、已經於美政府一月七日送致中日兩匣之牒文中說明、并　據該項方針之精神、所有一切條約凡　門户開放及凱洛格和平條約之條文相　者、美國將一律堅决否認之、此種宣言因日本在此次上海軍事行爲完成之後必將與美國外交關係上發生問題、故不得不預先訂立確切之原則、以爲將來外交政略上之圭臬、據老於觀察者言、日本於上海事變平息之後、勢將請求英美及其他各國之調解、始可與中國開始交涉云、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據聞胡佛總統對於抵制日本之議、無論由美國單獨實行、抑與國聯會會同進行、均所反對一、般人相信胡佛總統曾就此事向參議院各領袖徵詢意見、參議院共和黨首領華生宣言稱、美國若在經濟上封銷日本、不問是否單獨實行、余均極力反對、余欲美國置身於中日爭端之外、國聯會各會員國如願有所舉動、可聽其便云云、（二十三日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>倫敦英相麥唐納今日覲英皇於白金漢宮、英相雖遵醫士之囑、刻仍在病假期中、但關於滬事、無時不與閣員接洽、内閣之滬事委員會、今日在下院集議、内容嚴守秘密、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦今晨麥唐納入覲英王時、對於政局一般情形、有所奏對、但遠東問題、大約未嘗涉及、因最近閣議討論此項問題時、麥氏未嘗參加故也、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美國獲得教訓</h3>
<p>條約徒成具文不足消弭戰禍</p>
<p>被侵略所受損失較擴軍爲重</p>
<p>美參議員李特之演說</p>

<h3>Can the Japanese Military Suppress the World's Unified Public Opinion?</h3>
<p>Bin</p>
<p>In this instance, the Japanese military has resolutely ignited a world-shaking war in Shanghai. The excuses they hold are, firstly, to protect their residents, and secondly, to stop the anti-Japanese movement. The war has been ongoing for nearly a month; what has been the result of protecting residents? What has been the result of stopping the anti-Japanese movement? In other words, the lessons they are receiving by relying on their brute force and recklessly pursuing the invasion of China are already clearly visible.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the world's economic decline and the major powers' inability to attend to external affairs, as well as our nation's suffering from severe floods, Japan has resolutely seized our Northeast with violence, and now attempts to attack our Wusong and control the port of Shanghai, in order to monopolize the wealthy market of Shanghai. Their intentions have long been seen by the world, yet they still use the name of protecting residents. As a result, not only has it failed to protect residents, but it has also created a huge rift between the Chinese and Japanese nations. Moreover, they do not realize and still want to stubbornly go their own way, disregarding so-called public reason, justice, world peace, and international integrity. We would rather say that the Japanese military's audacity is due to the eruption of their aggressive ambitions, which has obscured all their rationality.</p>
<p>Japan has already provoked our nation's anti-Japanese movement with violence, and now wants to suppress it with violence. What they rely on is nothing but violence, and what they consider is nothing but aggression. However, once the war begins, right and wrong will be clear, and the place where public reason lies will ultimately be where victory belongs. Justice may be obscured by violence, but it will never be swallowed by violence. We are even more convinced of this without doubt.</p>
<p>According to recent news, both the government and the public in Washington advocate punishing Japan, and an economic blockade against Japan has become the focus of public opinion. British figures advocate that they should immediately jointly restrain Japan with the United States. The Liberal Party especially advocates implementing restraints against Japan. The Manchester Guardian also bitterly criticized the politicians of the League of Nations for being too cowardly to try to implement restraints, turning instead to trapping themselves. Others, such as Norway, Spain, and the South American states, all unanimously said that Japan disregarded the League Council's repeated advice to attack Shanghai, and strongly advocated invoking the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and other relevant treaties. As for the League of Nations, it has already issued a warning to Japan recently, and even has a plan to hold a special meeting to decide to adopt Article 16 of the Covenant to implement economic sanctions against Japan. World opinion has clearly and unanimously inclined towards anti-Japanese sentiment. Although it is still difficult to determine whether a joint economic sanction against Japan can be realized, it is a fact that there is such a trend. China resists Japan, while Japan implements violence to suppress it. Under this selective compilation, people all over the world are deeply angered by the Japanese military's tyranny and advocate punishing Japan. Doesn't this mean that the Japanese military will exert all its strength to question the world with its sins?</p>
<p>On the 22nd, the Japanese government replied to the League of Nations, saying that riots and civil wars occur in our country from time to time, and it cannot be regarded as an organized country, so the League of Nations Charter does not apply to our country. If it does not recognize us as an organized country, how can other countries allow us to be a part of the League of Nations, and rank us in the international community together with Japan, which boasts of being organized? Therefore, no matter whether this kind of wording ignores international etiquette and only damages its own reputation for establishing a country, even from the perspective of Japan's position, it only proves that it is gloating over disasters and taking advantage of people's dangers to satisfy its own greed. Is it the business of an organized country to constantly attack and seize the territory of other countries? The Japanese people's sophistry can be said to have reached its extreme. However, can people who cherish public reason in the world be deceived by them?</p>
<p>Our country now stands on the forefront of the battle between public reason and violence, resolutely taking on the great responsibility of maintaining public reason. Since January 28th, our country's army has bravely resisted violence, in order to maintain the survival of our nation and also to make a great contribution to the world and to all mankind. People of the world will surely give us great sympathy to jointly maintain this world's common public reason.</p>
<p>Defeated Enemy Troops Still Trying to Struggle</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Remaining Enemy in Jinmu Residence Was Still Under Siege; There Were No Fierce Battles in Wusong and Zhabei Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the fierce battle in Zhabei the night before last, our army's front line has extended to Fusheng Road, Qiujiang Road, Dade Lane, Yokohama Bridge, and other places. The enemy troops in Wusong are weak, so there were no fierce battles yesterday. However, the remaining enemy in Jinmu Residence in Jiangwan was still under siege yesterday, and it should be resolved today. The details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Jiangwan Area</h3>
<p>Miaohang Town Had Another Bloody Battle All Day Long</p>
<p>As a Result of the Fierce Battle, More Than 2,000 Enemies Were Killed Starting the day before yesterday, the Japanese army launched a general attack on Miaohang Town. After being completely defeated by our army, more than 20,000 enemy troops fled in panic, with more than 3,000 casualties. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. At 9:00 PM the night before last, when our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, it also completely surrounded more than 2,000 enemy troops near Jinmu Residence and Houjia Wooden Bridge, about ten miles south of Miaohang Town. Unexpectedly, at 12:00 PM that night, the vanguard troops of the retreating enemy had already received the report of the encirclement, so they contacted more than 15,000 remaining enemy troops, and also reported to the Japanese headquarters, dispatching more than 5,000 reinforcements to rescue the enemy troops. With this new force, they tried their best to counterattack, in order to rescue the besieged enemy troops from danger. Our army dispatched a part of its soldiers to meet the enemy troops, while another part still besieged the enemy troops. The fierce battle was extraordinary. By 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, more than 2,000 enemies had been killed or wounded, and their strength was gradually exhausted. The supporting troops completely collapsed. The enemy surrounded will be completely resolved today. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle in Miaohang All Day Long</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Miles South of Miaohang</p>
<p>At Jinmu Residence and Houjia Wooden Bridge, around 11:00 PM the night before last, there were already more than 2,000 Japanese troops surrounded by us. When the Japanese headquarters learned of this, they immediately dispatched a large number of reinforcements, along with the retreating soldiers, to launch a fierce counterattack against us. More than 30 enemy tanks and more than 20 armored vehicles stubbornly took the lead, hoping to break through our army in order to rescue the besieged enemy troops from danger. In this battle, the enemy troops could not use large artillery because their own troops were surrounded, so they only relied on machine guns and bayonets to engage in fierce hand-to-hand combat with us. Our army immediately dispatched a part of its soldiers, estimated to be more than 5,000, to fight them. The broadsword team, machine gun company, and mortar company were all transferred to the front to participate in the battle. At that time, our army's front and rear were connected, and because the enemy troops were worried about the surrounded soldiers, they could not fully exert their firepower. Therefore, although our army was outnumbered, it still had the upper hand. However, around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy troops' counterattack was still unfavorable, so the Japanese headquarters telegraphed the navy fleet to send multiple aircraft to fly to our army's position, launching fierce bombing and firing machine guns and artillery from the air. Our army was greatly threatened. At that time, a certain unit of our garrison in Dongzhen, Jiangwan, learned of the battle report and immediately took advantage of the faint morning mist to outflank the enemy troops' left flank, giving them a head-on blow. The enemy troops' vanguard showed signs of collapse, and around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the counterattacking enemy troops retreated about three miles. As a result, the besieged enemy troops and the counterattacking enemy troops were completely isolated from each other and could not respond to each other. However, because the enemy troops believed that this move was crucial to the battle situation, they launched a fierce assault from beginning to end. Our army also fought one against ten, striving to kill the enemy. The stalemate lasted until 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, when more than 2,000 enemies were killed or wounded, and their strength was gradually exhausted. The supporting troops completely collapsed. The more than 2,000 besieged enemy troops still resisted stubbornly. According to the military officers at the front, they will be completely resolved today.</p>
<h3>Enemy Machine Guns Captured in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>In the Jiangwan area,</p>
<p>the left wing of the enemy's 9th Division Regiment, and the 90th and 2nd Regiments, launched an attack on our position at noon yesterday. When the enemy troops advanced to 300 meters away, our army rushed out in force. Some of the enemy troops were forced to fight because they saw that our number was large, while others abandoned their weapons and fled when they saw the fierce momentum. In less than an hour, we had rushed to the trenches, capturing two machine guns and killing Lieutenant Nishio, the captain of the enemy's 9th Regiment, and nearly a hundred soldiers, including Moriyama and Yamamoto.</p>
<h3>Location of Japanese Headquarters</h3>
<p>The enemy's forward command</p>
<p>was originally located inside Fudan University. Starting yesterday, it was moved to the northeast corner of the Jiangwan Racecourse, across from the Guandi Temple. The surrounding civilian houses were completely burned down.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Japanese Corpses Transported Out</h3>
<p>The Japanese army has suffered repeated</p>
<p>failures in its general offensive against us. According to our meticulous investigation, the number of Japanese soldiers killed or wounded is definitely over 10,000. In addition to those abandoned on the battlefield and not recovered, the Japanese corpses piled up in the Great China Cotton Mill have reached more than 3,000. The high number of casualties has set a new record since the start of the war. Around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese military authorities sent about 30 logistical soldiers to supervise our coolies at the Yangshupu Wharf and about 60 or 70 arrested refugees, using 12 trucks to transport Japanese corpses from the Great China Cotton Mill. The corpses were all packed in sacks, with two people per sack, and tied with hemp ropes. Each truck carried about 50 sacks, and they were transported to a Japanese merchant ship berthed at the Yangshupu Wharf in succession, making a total of three round trips, totaling about 3,000 corpses. The corpses in the Great China Cotton Mill were not completely moved until after 2:00 PM. According to a certain worker who was forced to do this work by the Japanese yesterday, blood flowed into ditches in the Great China Cotton Mill, and the stench was overwhelming. Some severely wounded Japanese soldiers were still struggling on the ground, but they were unable to speak. The tragic scene was unbearable to witness. However, these dying or not-yet-dead wounded soldiers were also instructed by the logistical soldiers supervising them to be packed into sacks. Therefore, when I (the worker referring to himself) carried the sack onto the truck, the wounded Japanese soldiers were still wriggling in the sack.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Massacres Chinese People</h3>
<p>Western Spectators Cannot Bear to Watch</p>
<p>Mr. Saglai, the editor of the "Greater Shanghai Evening Post", witnessed the inhumane atrocities of the Japanese military while observing the battle at the Japanese military front line in Jiangwan on Monday (22nd). The translation of his original text is as follows: I inspected the Jiangwan Racecourse today and cannot help but be moved. The prosperous scene of horse racing that I saw before, with Chinese and foreign ladies and gentlemen coming and going, and the horse racing game under the bright sunlight, is completely a scene of misery and poison that I saw this morning. When I entered the field, there were piles of corpses everywhere, all of which I witnessed. Those who died tragically were often referred to as ambush soldiers or spies in the official reports of the Japanese military headquarters. Whether this is true or not, I do not want to argue, but among them were women and children. The women were shot in the back, and their cotton clothes were also pierced by single knives. The children were covered in bullet holes, and those dressed as peasant farmers were also piled up on the ground. The clothing of these people is not like that of soldiers, let alone women and children. I wonder if these are the ambush soldiers recognized by the authorities? The people in the headquarters and the Japanese embassy often told me that the Japanese navy and army do not fight against civilians, nor do they fight against the Chinese government or government troops, but only against the 19th Route Army in Guangdong. In that case, these innocent people should be disguised as the 19th Route Army. However, the dead are already gone, so how can we start to confront them? The burnt houses everywhere are even more witnessed by me. The Japanese military's arson skills are unparalleled. The remains of the burnt bodies are under the stands. I walked up to the stands and saw a team of infantry preparing to engage in close combat in Jiangwan Town, also stopping to watch the tragedy with me. At that time, the farmhouses were burning, and the fire was blazing, becoming a scene of fire-covered survivors being captured. An officer led a peasant-dressed person away from the group and stood in the sunlight. I saw a flash of a military knife stabbing into the human body, deep into the handle, and the person fell to the ground. One after another, like this. There was also a tall and lovely child. The Japanese military untied him, forced him to press his face to the ground between two corpses, and the Japanese officer fired six pistols at the same time, from behind, with bullet holes everywhere. The sound of gunfire stopped, the bullets were exhausted, and the person turning on the ground also stopped moving. Another person suffered the same fate. I could not bear to watch any longer, so I left. Yesterday, the newspaper had an editorial, strongly criticizing this matter, saying: The Shanghai incident is called "defense" by Japan. If so, it is defense of atrocities. It is a war made by Japan. If so, then true defense seems to require the destruction of families and the death of people.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Zhabei Area</h3>
<p>Yesterday Morning, the Remaining Enemy Attacked and Was Defeated</p>
<p>The Night Before Last, Shells Swept Over the Japanese Consulate</p>
<p>The Japanese army has been repeatedly defeated in its general offensive, and was further pressed by our army the night before last. It has actually collapsed into disarray. Therefore, there were no major battles yesterday. Our army's front line has reached the Hongzhen and Laobazi Road area. There is no trace of the Japanese army. The remnants are all in the Haining Road and Wusong Road area, and in the area from Outer Hongqiao to Inner Hongqiao, collecting the remnants.</p>
<h3>Division Commander Fu Jia's</h3>
<p>(Photo of Jiang Xi)</p>
<p>, to build defense works. At about 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a small portion of the Japanese army's remnants, about 300 people, once again launched a heavy attack on our army's front line. Before long, they were still defeated. In the Zhabei area, there were also small contacts in the Beisichuan Road area at dawn and around 6:00 PM last night. The battle situation in Zhabei yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The Remaining Enemy Attacks and Retreats</h3>
<p>At about 4:00 AM yesterday morning</p>
<p>, about 300 remnants of the Japanese army suddenly returned when they were completely defeated, and launched a fierce counterattack on our army's front line at the intersection of Beisichuan Road. At first, they bombarded with artillery. Our army also returned fire slightly. The artillery battle lasted until about 6:00 AM, when more than 300 Japanese troops suddenly changed from a gathering line to a skirmish line, and charged towards our army under the cover of tanks. Our army immediately gave them a head-on blow, using hand grenades, machine guns, etc. to fire fiercely at them, immediately destroying two tanks that were being used as cover on the Japanese army's left wing, and killing more than a hundred enemies. Seeing that the situation was not good, the remaining troops hurriedly retreated backwards, with two tanks covering them from behind. At this time, our army was in high spirits, and chased after them, blowing up two more Japanese tanks. A part of the lagging Japanese troops, about 60 or 70 people, were frightened and threw away their guns and retreated when they saw our army's fierce attack. In this battle, which lasted for more than three hours, a total of four Japanese tanks were defeated, more than 70 rifles and one machine gun were captured, and more than a hundred enemies were killed. Our army only suffered five or six casualties.</p>
<h3>Situation in Hongkou the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>On the evening of the day before yesterday (22nd)</p>
<p>, around 9:00 PM, the Japanese soldiers were defeated in a chaotic retreat. When our army approached the triangular vegetable market on North Henan Road, the Japanese residents hiding in Beisichuan Road, Kunshan Road, Hongkou, etc., found it difficult to hide any longer due to the urgency of our army's artillery fire. Therefore, they all fled south from the Waibaidu Bridge with quilts on their heads, rushing in like a flood through the hail of bullets. Therefore, for a time, the sidewalks along the Bund of the Huangpu River, such as the Taiwan Bank, the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, and the stone steps in front of the gates of various banks, were crowded with Japanese residents sitting on the ground, creating a scene of a sea of people. The kind of panic and embarrassment was beyond description.</p>
<h3>Witnessing the Defeated Enemy in Zhabei</h3>
<p>According to the tourists</p>
<p>who fled from the Henan Hotel in Baoxing Lane on North Henan Road, when 300 or 400 Japanese troops sneaked into the North Railway Station from Lai'an Lane on Xinmin Road around 8:00 PM the night before last, he happened to be staying in a room facing the street, and saw the Japanese troops pouring in through the glass window, using machine guns and mortars to record the rush. At the same time, the enemy's artillery team also fired to cover them. Our army remained silent from beginning to end, without firing a single shot. The Japanese army continued to advance towards the North Railway Station on Baoshan Road. After about 300 or 400 steps, our army's machine guns and rifles fired densely, and more than 20 of the Japanese army's vanguard fell to the ground, immediately stopping their advance. At this time, our army jumped out of the trenches and defense works and launched a counterattack against the enemy. The Japanese army fled in a chaotic manner along the original road, and was cut into two sections by our army. One part changed direction and fled towards Beisichuan Road, and the other part fled to the intersection of North Henan Road, and saw that our army had already resisted on the road ahead, so they rushed to the concession gate there. The American soldiers guarding there saw this and quickly fired their guns to warn them. The remnants turned around and broke through towards Xinmin Road, and as a result, few survived. Our army then pursued them to Laobazi Road.</p>
<h3>Izumo Battleship Almost Hit by Shells</h3>
<p>According to the "Continental Daily News",</p>
<p>before midnight yesterday (22nd), artillery fire near the North Railway Station bombarded the Japanese flagship Izumo. In an hour and a half, a total of 70 shells flew over the roof of the Japanese consulate and entered the Huangpu River, only a short distance from the Izumo battleship. At 12:30, the Izumo flagship was seen raising fire, presumably preparing to move to another anchorage.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation on Beisichuan Road</h3>
<p>Reporter Bravely Inspects Yesterday</p>
<p>New Developments in Our Army's Front Line</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the reporter went to North Henan Road, intending to inspect the situation in the Beisichuan Road area at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Laobazi Road, but was only able to reach the second line of defense of the American army at the intersection of Aierjin Road. The north of that point is a dangerous area, and at the same time, because the American army prevented further progress, the reporter was unable to fulfill his wish. Later, the reporter tried to detour to a certain lane at the south end of Laobazi Road, and finally had a glimpse of the real situation of Laobazi Road to Beisichuan Road. The Japanese soldiers who were originally building defenses at the intersection of Laobazi Road (in front of Tang Shaoyi's residence) have completely retreated, but along the road east to Beisichuan Road, neither Japanese soldiers nor our soldiers were seen, but the sound of rifles and machine guns was heard from time to time near Beisichuan Road. According to the residents there, many Japanese soldiers came and went on Laobazi Road yesterday (22nd). At about 8:00 PM, they were driven back by our army's northward attack. When the Japanese army retreated, the American army on North Henan Road fired machine guns, and the Japanese army was forced to retreat east to Beisichuan Road and Haining Road. After our army drove back the Japanese army on Laobazi Road, they still retreated to the Huajie area near Fusheng Road. According to those who escaped from the east of Beisichuan Road, our army was defending the area from Qiujiang Road, Dade Lane to Yokohama Bridge. When asked which army was defending the area north of Yokohama Bridge, they replied that they did not know. The reporter then turned back and went south, and when he reached the New Allen Cinema on Haining Road, he saw sandbags built at the east end of the intersection of Beisichuan Road, and several Japanese marines were defending it. There were very few pedestrians. When the reporter tried to move forward again, a certain gentleman in front of the hospital said that he could not go east, because the Japanese army fired or arrested people from time to time, and paid special attention to those wearing suits. The reporter then turned back and went south on North Henan Road, and along Suzhou Road to Sichuan Road Bridge, he saw five or six Japanese soldiers defending the north end of the bridge. According to the nearby residents, a machine gun was also set up at the intersection of Tiantong Road, and pedestrians had to be checked when passing by.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Wusong Area</h3>
<p>Enemy Warships Open Fire to Bluff</p>
<p>Enemy Intercepts Yangxing and Is Repelled</p>
<p>Because the enemy troops are focusing on the Miaohang Town area, there were no fierce battles in the Wusong area yesterday, except for the enemy warships opening fire and bombing as usual. The enemy troops on the front of Yunzaobang also invaded in small teams from time to time, but they were always repelled by our army. However, the day before yesterday, our side took advantage of the thinness of the enemy troops and took the offensive, which was quite successful. The battle situation obtained yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Annihilating the Japanese Army in Sicao Temple</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday</p>
<p>, a team of Japanese troops, about 80 or more, stationed in Nansitang River West, Xugang, and Black Bridge, forced a local villager to guide them, intending to circle around the west of Hujiazhuang and go straight to Yangxing. Unexpectedly, they were spotted by our army stationed at Jijia Bridge South, Sunjiazhai, and Sanqizhai. At that time, they all remained silent and hid in the trenches or in the houses and forests. After the enemy troops passed, they intercepted them again. The enemy thought that there were no our troops there and went straight past Sanqizhai. When they reached Sicao Temple, our army protruded from behind and opened fire with rifles and machine guns. The Japanese army knew that they had been tricked and desperately tried to break the encirclement. Because our army fought bravely to encircle them, the enemy's return route was cut off. After a fierce battle of about 40 minutes, reinforcements did not arrive, so all the enemy troops were wiped out. At the same time, the Japanese army at Zhoujia Bangkou of Yunzaobang used artillery to bombard the north, destroying the Yong'an Second Factory building. Then our army opened fire with machine guns, and the enemy was unable to support and retreated.</p>
<h3>Three Enemy Warships Attack Wusong</h3>
<p>In the Wusong area</p>
<p>, around 8:00 PM the night before last, five enemy warships sailed near the Songkou Fort and Songzhen to attack with artillery fire, which did not stop until about 12:00 PM in the deep night. In total, the enemy warships fired about 300 shells in four hours. Our army also returned fire. Kangjiazhai caught fire after being hit by enemy artillery. At the same time, the farmers' houses occupied by enemy warships in Zhanghuabang, Zhangxingzhai, and Xujiawan were also hit by our army's artillery fire, exploding and burning. At about 5:30 AM yesterday morning, three more enemy warships attacked the fort until about 8:00 AM, when the enemy warships left without success. At that time, two more large enemy bombers flew in from outside the port and dropped five or six bombs on our army's Yunzaobang position. They were immediately repelled by our army's anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Record of the Battle Situation the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The enemy troops on the Yunzaobang</p>
<p>front the day before yesterday (22nd) concentrated their efforts to attack our Miaohang area. As a result, most of the troops originally stationed there were transferred westward, hoping to launch a large-scale attack on our Miaohang and cut off our side's connection between Wusong and Zhabei. The enemy troops on the Yunzaobang front to the Zhanghuabang area were very weak. Our army north of the Yunzaobang learned of the situation and took the opportunity to attack across the Yunzaobang, forcing back the enemy troops on the front. When the enemy troops were forced to retreat, the situation was very embarrassing, and the rear line was extremely chaotic. In the afternoon, the enemy troops transferred thousands of reinforcements from the Jungong Road area. Our army then gave them a head-on blow, and the fierce battle lasted until late at night, when they were in a stalemate.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning, the Enemy Retreated to Tangjia Bridge</h3>
<p>According to reports from</p>
<p>the correspondents stationed in Song, from yesterday morning to 3:00 PM, there were no fierce battles on the Yunzaobang front. However, the number of enemy troops in the Zhanghuabang area seemed to have increased a lot compared to the day before. Because the enemy troops' attack on Mengjiazhai and Miaohang northwest of Jiangwan was defeated, a large number of enemy soldiers retreated to the area south of East Tangjia Bridge at dawn yesterday morning, and are currently in a stalemate with our army. The intermittent sounds of artillery and machine guns were clearly heard in the Yunzaobang area.</p>
<h3>Enemy Military Action on the Banks of the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 AM yesterday</p>
<p>, the reporter was riding a small steamer through the Jian Song Bridge and saw two enemy transport ships parked on the banks of the Huangpu River in front of the Zhabei Water and Electricity New Factory. He noticed that the enemy soldiers dressed in yellow were extremely busy up and down. At about 12:30 PM, a yellow Yangtze River shallow-water ship docked at the Zhanghuabang Grain and Rice Station wharf. More than 30 Japanese in plain clothes and White Russians carried several hundred wooden boxes measuring three feet long, one and a half feet wide, and one foot high (mostly munitions) from the Grain and Rice Station onto the ship. At the same time, an enemy warship slowly sailed into the Huangpu River from outside the port, firing artillery along the way to attack the fort and Songzhen. When it sailed to the Grain and Rice Wharf, it boarded the ship together with the yellow shallow-water ship.</p>
<p>Mr. Tan Lusun, Mr. Weng Zhaoyuan, Mr. Qiu Guozhen, and the Far East Society Presented</p>
<h3>Mr. Tan and Mr. Weng Sitting in Command</h3>
<p>This time, the Japanese</p>
<p>warlords drove their newly formed soldiers against our army's elite troops, which is why they have suffered repeated defeats. Moreover, with two strong generals, Tan Qixiu and Weng Zhaoyuan, sitting in command in Wusong, their command is decisive. Even if the Japanese pirates have both naval and air forces to cover their army, they will not be able to carry out their evil plans. It is heard that they have recently been appointed as the left and right deputy commanders of the Wusong area, and they will be able to show their skills even more.</p>
<h3>Enemy Headquarters Has Been Moved</h3>
<p>According to official reconnaissance</p>
<p>, the enemy's general headquarters in the Great China Cotton Mill was hit by our army's artillery shells the day before yesterday, and was moved yesterday. However, where it was moved to has not yet been ascertained.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Army's Cruel Acts</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army occupied Zhanghuabang, Heiqiao and other places, they have been slaughtering villagers indiscriminately and extorting money. Villagers who could not provide money were killed. In the house of a woman named Yao, who was over sixty years old and worked as a sorceress (commonly known as a "fairy"), the Japanese saw that her house was new and tidy, and specifically demanded money from her. When the woman refused, the Japanese said that such a good house could not be without money, and then slashed at her face with a knife. Both sides of her face were cut off, and she fell to the ground and died. The Japanese army then destroyed the house and left. Others, such as Yao Jianjian, the head of the Qianlu factory in Yaojiatou, Yao Huahua's wife, and Yao Yiting's son and daughter-in-law, were all shot dead for failing to provide money. Countless others whose names are unknown have suffered the same fate. Their cruel methods have reached their extreme.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, More Japanese Soldiers Landed</h3>
<p>According to reliable reports yesterday, two Japanese merchant ships docked at the Osaka Wharf yesterday, and more than 200 marines, more than 400 soldiers, and more than 100 cavalry landed. They also brought 1,000 rounds of ammunition, 40 steel plates, 60 boxes of hand grenades, and many small boats and bamboo ladders carried by the engineers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship Action in Bailonggang</h3>
<p>According to reports from Bailonggang, a very large Japanese warship arrived at Laohongwa in Bailonggang, Chuansha yesterday afternoon. Another report said that many Japanese warships in Shanghai have been ordered to return to their country in the past two days.</p>
<h3>Summary of Victory Reports from the Past Three Days</h3>

<h3>War Report from the Military Headquarters for the Past Two Days</h3>
<p>The battle situation the day before yesterday (issued at 9:00 AM on February 23rd): Since the enemy army issued a general offensive order at 7:20 AM on the 20th, fierce battles have been fought for days. After concentrating its forces to attack our Jiangwan area and being defeated by our army, the enemy changed its strategy again yesterday morning (22nd), concentrating its forces to attack our Miaoxing Town and attacking our Wusong area. Our army fought a bloody battle with them all day. As a result, the enemy army was defeated on all fronts. Currently, the enemy army is being surrounded and pursued by our army on all fronts. The fierce battles on each front yesterday are described in detail below: ㈠ The Bloody Battle of Miaoxing Town: At about 7:00 AM yesterday, the enemy army, with more than 20,000 soldiers and more than 30 tanks, advanced towards our Miaoxing Town. The defenders of this area were a small number of troops from Zhang Zhizhong's department, who immediately made contact with them. However, since the enemy army was large in number and came aggressively, more than ten tanks were used to form a line and advance, followed by large infantry units. Dozens of enemy planes in the air dropped bombs randomly on our army's positions, and the enemy's artillery continuously bombarded our front line. For a time, the firepower was concentrated and the sound shook the sky. The ferocity of the enemy's attack was unprecedented since the start of the war. Our soldiers from Zhang's department were also exceptionally brave, fighting fiercely with them for half a day, followed by hand-to-hand combat. Each of them was equal to ten enemies. Although the enemy's momentum was fierce, they ultimately failed to break through our army's line. The fierce battle continued until about 3:00 PM, when several thousand of the enemy's new forces were added to the front line, and the attack became even more fierce. The defenders, after prolonged fighting and exhaustion, were outnumbered, and at this time our position was in danger. Fortunately, our rear reinforcement brigade, Zhang Yan's brigade, rushed to the scene and surrounded and attacked the enemy army. At this point, the enemy gradually felt overwhelmed and retreated while fighting. Our army took advantage of the situation to pursue them, causing heavy casualties to the enemy. A portion of the wounded soldiers were unable to retreat and were surrounded by our army, and are still being annihilated in fierce fighting. In this battle, the enemy army suffered extremely heavy losses, with numerous casualties among officers and soldiers. Our army is safe and suffered only slight losses. ㈡ Annihilating the Enemy in Jiangwan: Yesterday morning, while concentrating all its forces to attack our Miaoxing Town, the enemy also attacked our Jiangwan area with several thousand troops. The defenders of this area were Liu Zhanxiong's regiment. Liu's regiment had been fighting fiercely with the enemy in Jiangwan for two days and one night without rest. It is said that the enemy troops attacking our Jiangwan numbered several thousand and had also been fighting fiercely for two days and one night without rest. However, our army's spirit of enduring hardship is several times better than that of the enemy. Once the enemy troops attacking the Jiangwan area yesterday were severely attacked by our army, they were unable to recover from the defeat. Our army pursued them closely, and the enemy fled in panic back to the Yangshupu area. Many were killed by our army along the way. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than a thousand casualties, while our army suffered very few losses. ㈢ The Situation in Wusong: Yesterday, the enemy army concentrated its forces to attack our Miaoxing Town and Jiangwan area, so the enemy's troops in the Wusong area were sparse. Our army took advantage of the victory to attack across the Yunzaobang River and pursue the enemy. At this time, several thousand of the enemy's new forces rushed to the scene, and our army engaged them in fierce fighting. The fighting is still ongoing. More than ten enemy warships shelled our Wusong Fort and Shizilin Fort all day yesterday, and dozens of enemy planes dropped bombs in the air to help the enemy's attack on Miaoxing Town. Some of the cannons at our Wusong Fort and Shizilin Fort were destroyed by enemy shelling. However, our Commander Tan Qixiu was unusually calm and calmly led workers to repair the destroyed gun positions amidst the enemy's fierce artillery and air attacks and continued to fight back. The enemy army ultimately failed to advance a single step in front of our fort. ㈣ In this war of resistance against Japan, the 19th Route Army has repeatedly crushed the strong enemy due to its loyalty, bravery, and skill in battle, preventing the Japanese from achieving their goals. However, the troops of Zhang Zhizhong, Yu Jishi, and Song Xilian, who participated in the frontline operations, were also exceptionally brave. Senior officers all took command on the front lines and were determined to kill the enemy. Since our national army has unanimously demonstrated a great spirit of sacrifice and is working together to kill the enemy, the Japanese invaders, though barbaric, will soon be exhausted.</p>

<p>War Reports Recorded by Western Newspapers</p>
<h3>Large Fire Inside and Outside Jiangwan Town</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury stated, "Last night (22nd), when driving north of Jiangwan, there was no need to light the lamps, as there was ample light available for use. As the tanks, officers' cars, motorcycles, cavalry, and infantry moved along the damp streets, flames were shot out from the homes of the farmers in succession, forming a tragic beacon illuminating the rear of the battlefield. The fire inside and outside Jiangwan Town has been burning for several days, but last night, with orderly efforts, it became even more uncontrollable. The purpose of the Japanese army is clearly to burn all the houses on and near the front line. Viewed from the Japanese army headquarters set up in a temple about a mile from the Jiangwan Racecourse, fires were breaking out everywhere on the east, north, and south sides, and spreading along the road. Soldiers piled firewood against the windward side of each house, and with a few gentle puffs from the early spring breeze, the flames soared into the sky in an instant. According to people in the headquarters, this is a necessary precaution, as snipers have been lying in ambush in several houses, or other houses may have been. Or there may not be any now, but there may be in the future. Burning them to the ground is therefore a way to eliminate hidden dangers. Several villagers stood by the roadside, watching their houses and property turn to ashes, but dared not say a word or make a gesture. Several officers in the headquarters, wearing warm military overcoats, paced and talked, as if they were strolling in an amusement park. Lieutenant General Ueda was at his desk having dinner, and a large character was visible on the wall behind his shoulder. Looking closely, it was the character for [Peace]. Alas, where is peace to be found?"</p>
<h3>Reports from Two Foreign Newspapers the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local North-China Daily News, The Times, and other newspapers carried news from the Japanese army headquarters regarding the battles of the 22nd, still claiming victory for the Japanese side and avoiding mentioning their defeat. However, the China Press reported that the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army, Lieutenant General Ueda, reported via wireless radio the day before yesterday evening, admitting the defeat of the Japanese army and stating, "This afternoon, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack in Miaoxing Town. In order to avoid heavy losses, our army (the Japanese army) retreated at about 2:00 PM. As far as I know, the number of dead and wounded on our side is 110 soldiers and 9 officers." It is said that on that day, according to news from the Japanese army headquarters reported by the China Press, at 5:30 AM, two columns of the Japanese army advanced towards Miaoxing Town and began attacking at 8:00 AM. The Chinese army offered slight resistance, and the central front retreated immediately. The Japanese army, unaware of this strategy, advanced aggressively, rejoicing that the enemy was not putting up much resistance. But by about 11:00 AM, the Chinese army's left and right wings advanced and surrounded them, cutting off the Japanese army's retreat. The Chinese army launched a fierce attack, and the Japanese army, unable to withstand it, retreated with its main force at 3:00 PM. More than a thousand men who had advanced were thus trapped. According to news from the Chinese headquarters at about 5:00 PM, except for a very small number who escaped, the rest were all eliminated by the Chinese army. As for the retreating Japanese army, one team of 8,000 men retreated to Yinxiang Township for reorganization, and another team of 7,000 men wanted to retreat to Yunzaobang. When they arrived at Jinmuzai, they encountered the Chinese army again. They were still fighting fiercely at 10:00 PM. Judging from this situation, before noon, the Japanese army thought they had won a great victory. The news obtained by the Western newspapers was probably from this time, leading to a result that was very different from the actual outcome of the battles on that day.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Transporting Dead and Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury stated, "Yesterday (22nd), trucks were seen continuously transporting dead and wounded Japanese soldiers to the Yangshupu Road Battlefield Hospital, two or three vehicles at a time, for a total of dozens of trips. The exact number could not be ascertained from the Japanese personnel. However, among the Japanese army's losses since the start of the war on January 28th, the Jiangwan battles this time are considered the heaviest."</p>
<p>A Compilation of News About the Japanese Army's Defeat</p>
<h3>Japanese General to be Dispatched to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The local Japanese newspaper, Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, stated, "In view of the developments in the Shanghai Incident, the Central Department of the Military Headquarters is considering increasing its forces. On the one hand, it will form a dispatch army to provide overall command, and the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Dispatch Army has been internally decided to be taken by General Hishikari, Military Councilor."</p>
<h3>Report of Japanese Reinforcements Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times stated, "Last night (February 22nd), reliable sources said that Japan had dispatched two more divisions of reinforcements, which are currently preparing to land near Shanghai. One is the 11th Division, and the other is the Tokyo 1st Division, which is the most valiant in Japan and is the elite force guarding the capital. They have all been dispatched to Shanghai. According to ship owners who passed Wusong, they saw two Japanese transport ships entering the port yesterday. A larger one was docked at the Zhanghuabang Jinghu Railway Wharf, and soldiers and artillery were being transported ashore. The other ship unloaded troops in Pudong last night. It is expected that these troops are preparing to attack the 23rd Route Chinese Army near Pudong. Although this news has not been verified by the Japanese headquarters, it comes from reliable sources."</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Gradually Slowing Down Attack on Wusong</h3>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun reported in a dispatch from Special Correspondent Hatano, "The enemy army (our army) on the opposite bank of Wusong has been stubbornly resisting for several days, defending resolutely and refusing to yield despite artillery attacks and aerial bombings. Our army (the Japanese army) is also unwilling to attack further and is temporarily retreating to the first line on the left bank of the Wusong River to rest. Brigade Commander Shimo Motoda, along with Senior Staff Officer Katamura and Adjutant Tanaka, inspected the front line on Jun'gong Road on foot and encouraged morale, planning to counterattack. However, judging from the current situation, the general attack on Wusong will still take a considerable amount of time."</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Reports on Killed Military Officers</h3>
<p>The ferocity of the Jiangwan battles on the 22nd was rare since the start of the war. Yamaguchi, the captain of the Empty Space 0th Team (of the Japanese army), went missing. Staff Sergeant Sato, Captain Shigemi, and Lieutenant Yamaguchi are all in danger of losing their lives. There were more than eighty others seriously injured, and countless others lightly injured.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aviation Colonel Killed in Action</h3>
<p>The local Japanese newspaper, Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun, reported that at 5:00 PM on the 22nd, two attack planes and two fighter planes of our army's (Japanese army's) air squadron, led by Captain Shirahama, flew to Suzhou to scout the enemy's (our) airfield. On the way back, they suddenly encountered enemy planes (our army). The enemy immediately opened fire fiercely in the air. Captain Otani was killed on the spot.</p>
<h3>Japanese Shops in Hongkou Close Down</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury stated, "A small number of Japanese residents living on North Sichuan Road and Dixiwei Road moved out one after another this morning (February 23rd). The nearby food shops, which had never closed since the start of the war, are all closed today as well."</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Drop Bombs Twice on Hongqiao</h3>
<p>Dropped 250-pound bombs</p>
<p>Twice, for a total of 18 bombs</p>
<p>Only three of our dilapidated old planes were destroyed</p>
<p>Our side shot down two more enemy planes yesterday</p>
<p>Japanese planes were active everywhere yesterday, dropping bombs and bombing, but had no impact on our military affairs. The Hongqiao Airfield was bombed twice yesterday morning, but only three old planes were damaged. Two enemy planes were shot down by us during the fierce battle in Jiangwan yesterday. The details are as follows.</p>
<h3>Two Enemy Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the enemy launched a general attack on Jiangwan Town, Wusong, and the Baziqiao area, and the fighting was very fierce. Dozens of planes were dropping bombs and bombing. Our army used anti-aircraft guns to aim and fire, and shot down one on the spot. The plane had the character "氷" (ice) on its body. Also, in the afternoon, our air force made contact with several enemy planes. The two sides fought fiercely. Our pilots used machine guns to strafe, and one enemy plane was shot down by us.</p>
<h3>Hongqiao Airfield Bombed</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a large group of planes flew to the Hongqiao Airfield in western Shanghai to drop bombs and bomb. There were two attacks in total, the first at around 10:00 AM and the second about an hour later, for a total of 18 bombs. Each bomb weighed 250 pounds and had great explosive power. However, there were no planes from our side in the airfield, and only three old planes were destroyed, so the losses were not heavy, only empty houses and open ground. At the time, one soldier on guard was scratched by bomb fragments. Most of the bombs fell outside the airfield. After one bomb exploded to the west of the airfield, it injured Shao Xiaodi, a villager, in both legs. A large tree was destroyed and a small wooden bridge was broken after a bomb exploded to the north of the airfield. Two houses near Chenjiaqiao were destroyed and a child was injured. Also, The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury stated that this morning (February 23rd), Japanese planes bombed the Hongqiao Airfield twice in succession. The first bombing involved five bomber planes and two pursuit planes, which appeared in the sky over the Hongqiao Airfield at 9:30 AM, flying very low, knowing that there were no anti-aircraft guns there. The planes circled near the hangars and dropped multiple bombs, each weighing 250 pounds. Two bombs hit the hangars and destroyed three dilapidated old planes, one of which was an experimental plane made by the Nieuport company in this city, which had never flown, one was a gift from overseas Chinese many years ago, and one was an old-fashioned French plane that had not left the ground for more than a year. Air Force Commander Shen Decheng was at the airfield at the time. Seven bombs fell outside the airfield, and the impact created huge craters, some with a diameter of about eight feet. One soldier in the airfield was hit by bomb fragments and suffered minor injuries. There were no other deaths or injuries. Around 11:00 AM, six more planes carrying bombs came to bomb again. At this time, a representative of The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury and staff from the airfield were inspecting the damage from the first bombing. They heard the warning siren and quickly left the airfield and lay in wait to observe. First, they saw three large bombers slowly flying around the airfield, about 2,000 feet above the ground, dropping two bombs, which fell into the airfield and exploded with a roar. In an instant, two more bombs were dropped. Although the mud and earth were thrown into the air, they did not hit the hangars. A few seconds later, three more bombers dropped four bombs. One fell near the hangar and damaged a wooden shed, and one fell outside the airfield and was said to have fallen in a foreigner's garden, but this has not been confirmed. In the first attack, ten bombs were dropped. In the second attack, eight bombs were dropped. A total of seventeen bombs were dropped. The Chinese authorities had anticipated this and took precautions, so the losses were minimal. The Chinese Aviation Company's Shanghai-Hankou-Chengdu and Shanghai-Peiping lines are now based in Nanjing. The Junkers planes of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation are said to be in Peiping. The Aviation Training School established by the National Government in Hongqiao was moved to Anning at the beginning of the war.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Active Everywhere</h3>
<p>㈠ Dachang: After 8:00 AM yesterday morning, one Japanese plane came to the Dachang area, followed by two more half an hour later. The planes all took off from the east and flew over the Jiangwan sky, seemingly reconnoitering once. When they reached Dachang, they dropped several bombs at Longwangqiao, then one plane flew east and six planes flew south. At around 10:00 AM, the Japanese planes dropped four or five bombs about a mile from the corner of Shanghai-Taicang Road and Zhongshan Road. All of them landed in the barren fields, and no one was injured. They then flew west at 10:35 AM, seemingly heading to Zhenru. But at 2:10 PM, three planes came again from the south, followed by two more soon after, and finally three more, for a total of eight planes. All of them circled around Dachang. They did not drop any bombs near Dachang. Occasionally, loud noises were carried by the wind, and the bombs seemed to have landed at a great distance. ㈡ Zhabei: At around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, six Japanese planes flew to the Zhenru area for reconnaissance. When they reached the vicinity of the International Radio Station, they flew very low, intending to drop bombs. At that time, three of our planes at that location immediately took off and used machine guns to drive away and attack the Japanese planes. The Japanese planes then fled towards Zhabei. Our planes were still chasing after them. Near the Zhabei McGillen Road station, the six Japanese planes suddenly formed a line and attacked our planes, opening fire. Our planes also opened fire in return. The two sides fought fiercely for about an hour. Two Japanese planes were damaged and fled east first, and the remaining four planes also fled east soon after. Our planes did not pursue them and flew back to their original positions.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Drop Bombs and Injure People</h3>
<p>㈠ Jiangwan: At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, eight Japanese planes circled over the Jiangwan Town area for a long time and dropped more than twenty bombs in the western part of the town. More than ten bombs hit the Niulang Temple, destroying it completely. Nearby civilian houses were also bombed and collapsed. One incense burner was killed in the temple. The planes then flew to the Yianmaowan area west of Jiangwan and dropped five or six bombs, destroying several civilian houses and injuring three poor people. ㈡ Zhabei: At around 3:00 PM yesterday, Deputy Captain Dai Tianren of the Dong 時, three squadrons of nine Japanese planes flew to McGillen Road, Baziqiao, Republican New Road, and other places in Zhabei and dropped dozens of bombs. Four bombs hit McGillen Road, bombing a corner of a civilian house. Most of the bombs did not explode. Flying bricks injured one pedestrian. Seven or eight bombs were dropped at Baziqiao, causing no damage. Three bombs hit Republican New Road, bombing one civilian house and injuring two pedestrians. ㈢ Pengpu: At 3:00 PM yesterday, six Japanese planes circled and reconnoitered in the sky over Pengpu Town and then dropped four or five bombs at Dongjia浜 and Song Park Road south of the town. Only one bomb exploded on Song Park Road, injuring one pedestrian. ㈣ Dachang: At around 9:00 AM yesterday, more than ten Japanese planes reconnoitered in the area near Dachang. Two planes risked flying low and opened fire, dropping two bombs, which landed in the civilian farmland southwest of Dachang Station, creating a deep hole more than ten feet deep. They then flew to the Baohua Temple and other places south of Dachang and dropped four or five bombs. One room at the rear of the Baohua Temple was destroyed by the bombing. After our army fired at them, they fled immediately.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army's Insidious Intentions</h3>
<p>General Commander Chiang's Letter Requesting a Protest</p>
<p>General Commander Chiang Kwang-nai of the 19th Route Army sent a letter to Mayor Wu, stating, "To the Mayor: I have just received a report from Wang Geng, the commander of the Independent Brigade under my command, stating that Zhang Qingwu, the battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment under his command, reported that Yue Zhonglin, the company commander of the 10th Company under his command, reported that Duan Chengtuo, the sentinel leader of the 1st Platoon under his command, reported that Zhao Jingcheng, a teacher at the Chinese Elementary School, reported that he personally went to the Catholic Church on Wusong Road this morning on official business and saw many Japanese people wearing white clothes connected from top to bottom, with a red cross on their left arms, and carrying weapons and gas canisters. There were more than 500 eyewitnesses, and they were preparing to set out. After investigating, their intentions are insidious: ㈠ To use the protection of the Red Cross to rush into our positions, and then, along with the main force of the Japanese army, occupy our positions at the same time. If our army resists, they will say that our country is violating international law by killing Red Cross personnel, causing international indignation. If our army does not resist, they will act as vanguards, leading the main force to occupy our territory and kill our compatriots. Thinking of this, I am filled with hatred and report to your army, who will report to your superiors, and notify all friendly forces to make full preparations and not fall into their trap. I am a Chinese person, and at this time of national survival, I dare not hide anything I have seen or heard. In view of this, I should report to you for verification and forwarding, and so on. In view of this, I should report for verification and forwarding, and so on. In view of this, I should report for verification and forwarding. In view of this, after investigating, the Japanese army wants to maintain the ferocity of imperialism and achieve its goals of aggression, and will do anything that violates public reason and disregards reputation, such as slaughtering innocent merchants and civilians, deliberately bombing refugee shelters, shooting Red Cross member Liu Qirui, using internationally banned dumdum bullets, and slandering our country in the League of Nations as a disorderly and disorganized country, calling our army dangerous elements. Such facts are too numerous to mention. Recently, since the Japanese side does not hesitate to expand the war, it is within our expectations that they will adopt even more despicable means to slander our army. According to the previous report, in addition to ordering all troops to be vigilant, I hereby request your government to file a protest immediately and inform the International Committee of the Red Cross General Assembly to stop the Japanese army from using Red Cross teams to carry weapons and poisons, in order to maintain the reputation of the Red Cross. This is a matter of great public concern. To Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai. General Commander Chiang Kwang-nai."</p>
<h3>Talk by Chief of Staff Zhao</h3>
<p>All military matters have already been meticulously planned. Zhao Yijian, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army Headquarters, stated to reporters, "Our army's resolve to resist Japan to the death and to persevere to the end has been repeatedly expressed, and we trust it is well understood. Recently, the Japanese invaders, due to repeated defeats, fear they cannot maintain their imperialistic ferocity or fulfill their aggressive ambitions, and are increasing their violence and expanding the war. They have dispatched powerful reinforcements with the most advanced weaponry, including airplanes, giant warships, heavy artillery, tanks, and poison gas, attempting to intimidate our army, coerce the government, and alarm society. People are inevitably expressing their concerns and worries for our army. While their intentions stem from caring for the soldiers, their impact could actually undermine morale. A just cause strengthens, while injustice brings self-destruction. Time may vary between past and present, but truth remains constant. Before the European War, was Germany lacking in material wealth to boast about? Yet, in the end, it could not withstand the sanctions of justice. The Japanese brutality is unprecedented. Consider the burning of prosperous urban areas, the slaughter of unarmed civilians, the bombing of refugee shelters, and the use of dumdum bullets. Wherever they go, they defy the world's condemnation. Therefore, using poison gas is hardly surprising. However, a soldier's duty is to die for his country, and death is not feared. What else is there to fear? If the spirit of the entire nation does not die, and the world's justice still exists, even if the 19th Route Army as an entity is destroyed, through sincere devotion, countless 19th Route Armies will step forward, one after another. How can the Japanese invaders kill all the Chinese people, or all of humanity? The only way to counter brutality is with a resolution to fight to the death. Cowardly compromise or panicked flight will not bring salvation. Furthermore, the enemy has already meticulously planned all military actions, and has a well-calculated strategy for defeating us and achieving victory. We hope that all compatriots throughout the country will invigorate the spirit of national salvation, prepare for a long-term resistance against Japan, and not be misled by the enemy. Ultimately, the final victory will be ours."</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Again Used Foreign Vessels as Cover for Combat Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Danger when the Hanyang Wheel entered port. The Japanese Navy wants to shift disaster onto foreign vessels. Since Japanese warships began shelling Wusong, they have repeatedly failed. Recently, due to the range of our artillery, they dare not approach within the Wusong artillery fire zone. Enemy warships traveling between Shanghai and Wusong often take advantage of foreign merchant ships entering and exiting, following them for cover and using the merchant ships as shields to fire on our Wusong forts. On the 20th of this month, at 1:30 PM, the Taikoo Wuchang Wheel arrived in Shanghai from the Yangtze River. As it entered the port, two Japanese warships used the Wuchang Wheel as cover and fired over twenty shells at our positions. On the 22nd, when the company's Poyang Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Hankou, two more Japanese warships used the ship's shield as it sailed into Wusong and fired eighteen shells at our forts. We feared harming innocent foreign vessels, so we refrained from returning fire. However, yesterday, as the Taikoo Hanyang Wheel entered the port, Japanese warships again used a merchant ship for cover and heavily bombarded our forts. The Hanyang Wheel's experience is described in detail below.</p>
<h3>Hanyang Anchors at Wusong Waiting for Tide</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Hanyang Wheel, coming from Hong Kong to Shanghai, arrived outside Wusong port at 11:00 AM yesterday. Due to the low tide, it anchored to wait. Nearby, in the waters off Shitousha, were six Japanese torpedo boats and one gunboat. Around 2:00 PM, the tide rose high enough to allow passage, and the Hanyang Wheel raised anchor and entered the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Warships Sneak Along</h3>
<p>As the Hanyang Wheel departed from Wusong and entered the Huangpu River, the seven Japanese warships anchored at Shitousha, including two torpedo boats, one from the 22nd Flotilla and one from the 26th Flotilla, saw the Hanyang setting sail. They also set sail, following closely behind. As they approached Wusong, the two Japanese warships increased their speed and overtook the Hanyang, simultaneously shifting their gun positions and loading shells, carrying out their plan to use the merchant ship as cover to fire on our forts.</p>
<h3>Firing on the Forts</h3>
<p>As they approached the Wusong port, the two Japanese warships used their maximum speed to overtake the Hanyang Wheel and, positioned ahead of the merchant ship, bombarded our Wusong forts, firing seven shells in quick succession. The reason the Japanese warships sped ahead of the Hanyang was to use the British merchant ship's stern as a shield, preventing our forts from returning fire. Even if we had returned fire, the shells would have landed on the Hanyang. Their methods are vicious and their behavior despicable, seeking to shift the disaster onto foreigners.</p>
<h3>Our Side Tolerated and Did Not Fire</h3>
<p>When the two Japanese warships moved ahead and opened fire, the captain of the Hanyang was greatly alarmed. He believed that the Japanese Navy's actions clearly sought to harm innocent merchant ships and use them as shields to prevent the Chinese army from firing back. Such actions placed the merchant ships of all nations in Shanghai in extreme danger. The Hanyang sped into Wusong at full speed. Fortunately, the defending troops at our forts showed restraint and did not fire a single shell. The two Japanese warships stopped as soon as they cleared the artillery fire zone. The Hanyang Wheel entered the port at 3:30 PM, and the captain reported the incident to the company upon arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>International Red Cross Questions Japan</h3>
<p>Why Dumdum Bullets Used to Shoot Chinese Soldiers. The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from the International Red Cross in Tokyo at 9:00 AM on the 23rd, stating that they had forwarded the Chinese Red Cross's telegram to the Japanese Red Cross, questioning why their army used dumdum bullets to shoot Chinese soldiers.</p>
<h3>Governor-General of the Philippines Roosevelt Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The newly appointed American Governor-General of the Philippines, Roosevelt, arrived in Shanghai from the United States yesterday. Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a tea party at his residence on Haig Road at 5:00 PM to welcome him, and invited the British and American Consuls-General and members of the Central Committee staying in Shanghai, including Wang Zhengting and Kong Xiangxi, to attend.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Insult German Residents</h3>
<p>German Consul in Shanghai Lodges Protest. The National News Agency reported from Berlin on the 23rd that, according to the Berlin Evening News, the German Consul-General has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Consul-General because Japanese reservists in Hongkou insulted German residents. One German resident, living on Diswei Road, attempted to return to his residence, but despite presenting a pass issued by the Japanese Consul-General, the Japanese refused to allow him to pass and argued with him. The Japanese man shouted at him, "Foreigners are useless, Germans are spies!" The protest stated that the Japanese man was clearly uneducated, so the German Consul-General did not focus on the matter. However, he had to protest the Japanese civilians' usurpation of police authority. The article also stated that the situation in the Hongkou area was extremely regrettable.</p>

<h3>Liaoning Case Investigation Team to Inquire</h3>
<p>Having crossed the Pacific, they will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>Listening to news of the Shanghai battle en route.</p>
<p>Team members first arrive in Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p>On September 18th, the violent Japanese forcibly occupied our Northeast, resulting in the loss of 200,000 square miles of Chinese territory, which has been submitted to the League of Nations for sanctions in order to recover the lost land. For several months, the League of Nations has not taken effective measures, only organizing a commission to investigate the Liaoning case, sending them to Liaodong to conduct on-site inspections to provide a basis for future handling of the Liaoning case. The investigation team has already left the United States and is about to arrive in China. The latest news regarding their itinerary is detailed below.</p>
<h3>Team Members Have Crossed the Pacific</h3>
<p>The League of Nations-appointed Liaoning Case Investigation Team, comprising British representative Lord Lytton, American commissioner Mr. McCoy, and commissioners from France, Germany, and Italy, along with three members of the League of Nations Secretariat, arrived in San Francisco, USA, on the 8th of this month. They boarded the President Coolidge of the Dollar Steamship Lines to come to China. Due to waiting for all the commissioners to arrive, the ship was delayed by one day. Yesterday, the Shanghai office of Dollar Steamship Lines received a telegram stating that the commission arrived in Honolulu on the 18th of this month. The commissioners stayed in Honolulu for fourteen hours before departing. As of yesterday, the commission had crossed the Pacific and, within ninety-six hours, would arrive in Japan.</p>
<h3>Can Arrive in the Orient on Sunday</h3>
<p>It is reported that the commissioners on the President Coolidge are extremely concerned about events in the Far East, even while sailing on the high seas. They receive daily reports via the President Coolidge's wireless telegraph about the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai, which are broadcast by a private radio station from a certain Shanghai firm to provide information for the commissioners to consider. It has been confirmed that the commission is expected to arrive in Yokohama, Japan, on the afternoon of the 28th, where they will disembark and proceed to Tokyo first.</p>
<h3>News of the Commission's Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>When the commission first departed, they planned to go directly to the Three Eastern Provinces after arriving in Japan. However, upon hearing of the outbreak of war in Shanghai, they became very concerned. It is confirmed that the commissioners' decision on whether or not to come to Shanghai will depend on the situation after arriving in Tokyo. If the war in Shanghai is not too intense at that time, the commission plans to take the President Coolidge to Shanghai on the afternoon of March 3rd before proceeding to Shenyang for investigation.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Members Staying in Shanghai Will Comfort the 19th Route Army Today</h3>
<p>The Central Committee members staying in Shanghai believe that the 19th Route Army's resistance against the Japanese army is commendable for their service to the country. Therefore, they have appointed five members, Kong Xiangxi, Fang Zhenwu, Xue Dubi, Fu Rulin, and Chen Qingyun, to take a large quantity of goods to the front lines at 11:00 AM today to comfort the soldiers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Burn Down the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society</h3>
<p>The Chinese Arts and Crafts Society, located at the end of North Sichuan Road in this city, is composed mostly of people who returned from studying in Japan. Since the September 18th Incident, the society members have been actively involved in national salvation efforts, which the Japanese deeply resent. Since the Japanese invaded Shanghai, their Naval 1st Fleet Headquarters was located opposite the society. On January 29th, the Japanese Naval Headquarters sent naval personnel and ronin to break into the society, search and destroy it, and then affix a notice from the Japanese Naval Headquarters to the main gate before leaving. On February 22nd, our troops attacked the end of North Sichuan Road, and the Japanese army was defeated. During their retreat, they set fire to the society. It is reported that the society housed a large number of specialized books, worth approximately 200,000 yuan, and members had deposited specialized books worth approximately 100,000 yuan. In addition, there were dozens of unpublished manuscripts submitted by members for publication. Moreover, the society's secretary, the social education expert Ma Zongrong, had collected over a thousand specialized books on social education over the past ten years, all of which were reduced to ashes. This is indeed another great loss for Chinese culture.</p>

It is reported that there are still branches in various places that have not yet paid, amounting to approximately 10,000 yuan, which should continue to be remitted soon, demonstrating the overseas Chinese's concern for their motherland.</p>
<h3>Please Solicit Donations from Lawyers in All Provinces</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association sent a letter to lawyers' associations in all provinces yesterday, stating: "Since the September 18th Incident, the violent Japanese have occupied our land with force, treated our people as straw dogs, and oppressed our government. Although our compatriots throughout the country are heartbroken and hold irreconcilable hatred, they still uphold the Central Government's respect for the Washington Treaty and faith in the League of Nations, enduring grievances and seeking compromise while strictly maintaining order and refusing to give the enemy a pretext. However, the violent Japanese, seeing that our government is not responding with military force, believe we are cowardly and can be bullied, and are thus taking advantage of the situation, advancing step by step, harassing Tianjin, coveting Jehol, and provoking incidents in Hankou and Fuzhou, eyeing South China. Most recently, on the night of January 28th, the Japanese army suddenly attacked Shanghai. Our 19th Route Army, with public loyalty and love for the country, fought back bravely, and for two weeks, the violent Japanese have relied on their naval, land, and air forces, using the foreign concessions as their base, arbitrarily attacking Zhabei with heavy artillery and bombs, turning prosperous streets into ruins, and slaughtering many innocent people. Fortunately, our 19th Route Army has won consecutive battles, managing to slightly blunt the enemy's ferocity. However, they still refuse to come to their senses, continuing to reinforce their troops and actively invade. This association believes that Shanghai is the center of our national economy and culture, and the current invasion by the violent Japanese is not a local issue, but one that concerns the entire country. Today, the violent Japanese are using force without cause to invade our Shanghai. How can we guarantee that they will not take advantage of their victorious momentum to disturb and invade other places? Therefore, the victory or defeat of the 19th Route Army in resisting the violent Japanese is the key to the entire safety of China's territory. Therefore, an Economic Committee has been established to implement general mobilization, with all members unanimously raising 100,000 yuan to comfort the frontline soldiers of the 19th Route Army, in order to encourage morale and resist to the end. Furthermore, at the 98th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of this association, it was decided to send a letter to all lawyers' associations across the country, unanimously soliciting donations to comfort the frontline soldiers fighting in Shanghai and jointly save the country from disaster. The time is now or never; do not delay. Respectfully, the Shanghai Lawyers Association, 21.2.23."</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Continues to Send Supplies</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association, in recognition of the valiant killing of enemies by the frontline soldiers of the 19th Route Army and their consecutive victories, established a Comforting Soldiers Association. One hundred Economic Committee members were appointed, and in less than two weeks, they traveled around soliciting donations. As of yesterday, only one-tenth of the donation registers had been returned to the association, but they had already raised 18,900 yuan in cash. In terms of supplies, they had already sent items to the 19th Route Army Headquarters twice. Yesterday, they loaded a large truck with 200 silk cotton vests, 500 towels, and straw sandals, which was transported to the 19th Route Army Headquarters by a standing committee member of the association to comfort the frontline soldiers.</p>
<h3>Ladies Present Poems to Comfort the Soldiers</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Women's Military Clothing Donation Association, they rushed to make clothing and send them to the front lines. Although the amount of money and goods raised was not large, there were cases such as the three young children, aged six or seven, of Mr. Feng of Siwen Lane on Datong Road, who knew to break open their piggy banks and donate all the money to the soldiers on the front lines. There was also a student named Liu, only thirteen years old, who volunteered to solicit donations for the association every day and personally delivered two buckets of rice porridge to the Boy Scout shelter every morning. This is truly commendable. Furthermore, each of the woolen neck warmers knitted by the ladies of the association was tied with encouraging messages. Some of them are recorded below: "Wind and snow enter the new spring, war rises in Shanghai. I hate that the thread is too short, hoping to comfort the soldiers setting out." (Woven and inscribed by Chen Caizhen) "Weave this item, to express our heartfelt feelings, to comfort our soldiers, to warm our weapons. Defend the territory with all our might, serve the country with loyalty, annihilate those ugly kinds, and achieve success." (Lu Junrui) "Each stitch and thread is carefully made, sent to the front lines to comfort those who have contributed. Do not forget to defend against the cold and resist invasion, women at home join the nation in saving the country." (Shi Shuyun) "Qin Da alone faces the Milky Way, how can I not feel sad? Cheer for the brave soldiers, sing triumphant songs." (Hu Shuqing) "Scholars and commoners celebrate their release, the Japanese invaders tremble in the cold. Only to avenge the national shame, truly to cut down the tower." (Hu Youqing)</p>
<h3>Famous Ladies Rush to Knit Woolen Vests</h3>
<p>Accountant Zhuang Zhujiu and Ms. Sheng Aigu, among others, comforted the 19th Route Army by personally soliciting donations from relatives and friends, raising a total of 1,100 yuan and knitting woolen vests. Those who participated in the knitting included Mrs. Chen Rub, among others, and many famous ladies, completing the work in the extremely short time of five days and five nights. One nine-year-old girl even worked tirelessly, completing two pieces. Each piece was adorned with slogans to boost morale and was sent to the rear office of the 19th Route Army yesterday.</p>
<h3>The 19th Route Army Needs Underwear</h3>
<p>This time, the 19th Route Army resisted the bloody battles, and the national spirit was greatly boosted. Shanghai in particular was very enthusiastic. The colleagues of the First Studio of the Shanghai Lianhua Film Company, concerned about the cold weather recently, donated 663 pairs of cotton underwear to the soldiers on the front lines yesterday. It is reported that the army found this cotton clothing extremely useful, and that other items such as underwear are urgently needed. If people from all walks of life have underwear to donate to the soldiers in the future, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<h3>Hubei Compatriots Association Donates 1,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Hubei Compatriots Association wrote a letter to the 19th Route Army, stating: "Commander Jiang, Commander Cai, Commander Dai, May this reach you. Since the violent Japanese invaded Shanghai, destroying public law and disregarding humanity, their various atrocities are outrageous. Fortunately, your army's soldiers have been loyal, brave, and determined to resist, charging forward and repeatedly defeating the enemy, bringing glory to the country and seeking survival for the nation. The members of our association are filled with admiration and respectfully prepare 1,000 silver yuan to express our respect and comfort. We respectfully send this and wish you continued victories. The Hubei Compatriots Association in Shanghai respectfully."</p>
<h3>Chinese Buddhist Association Comforts the Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Since forming a rescue team, the Chinese Buddhist Association has been actively working on the front lines every day. Yesterday, lay Buddhists, including Sha Yongzhi, rescued a truckload of refugees and sent them to shelters. In addition, a large quantity of comfort items were distributed to various rear hospitals by Master Hongsan, Master Changxing, and lay Buddhist Zhao Yunzhao, who also preached the Buddhist doctrines of compassion and saving the world, which were received with joy by all who heard them.</p>

<h3>Kunfan Teachers and Students Send Face Masks, Jackets, and Pants</h3>
<p>The teachers and students of Kunfan Women's High School are exceptionally enthusiastic about comforting the troops. They previously solicited donations from various sectors, raising 464 yuan in silver and 209 jiao in small coins, and rushed to make 236 dust-proof face masks and 500 jackets and pants, all of which were completed the night before. Yesterday, the student council of the school sent four representatives to deliver the face masks and other items to the National Crisis Soldiers Comfort Association and the 19th Route Army office, and learned that the school's students are now rushing to make 500 pillowcases for use in military hospitals.</p>

<p>Relief Work</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan and Others Organize a Hospital</h3>
<p>Philanthropists Zhu Qinglan, Zhang Peinian, Huang Renlin, Gao Dajing, and Wang Minshi in this city initiated the organization of a wounded soldiers hospital. They immediately began work, and Mr. Zhang Peinian was appointed as the director, Mr. Wang Minshi as the director of medical affairs, and Mr. Wang Jialong as the director of general affairs. The old site of Huadong Middle School in Hengqing Lane, Yuanle Road, French Concession, was selected as the hospital site. It has been reported to the Red Cross Society and named the 23rd Wounded Soldiers Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society. All arrangements were completed within 20 hours of the decision to organize the hospital. All staff and nurses volunteered to serve. Two batches of wounded soldiers have already been admitted, and nearby residents and shops are competing to donate food and supplies, which is quite enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Niu Huisheng Organizes a Wounded Soldiers Hospital</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the intense fighting, there are many wounded soldiers. The Relief Division of the Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association organized a wounded soldiers hospital in Peide School at the intersection of Datong Road and Avenue Edward VII. All equipment was prepared in a short period of time. All iron beds were rented, and the bedding was brand new. After the wounded soldiers were admitted, they were first bathed and then changed into new clothes. There are two operating rooms with ample light and perfect layout. It is said that the director of medical affairs is Yan Fuqing, and the deputy director is Luo Chuanrong. Third-year students of the Zhongda Medical College are all medical assistants. A new kitchen has been set up and is closely monitored by sanitation supervisors. It is said that Mr. Niu Huisheng is in charge of general affairs.</p>
<h3>Aurora University Auditorium Converted into Hospital</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident occurred, Aurora University on Rue Luber has been working hard to rescue wounded soldiers, as reported in this newspaper. Recently, the war at the front has been expanding, and the number of wounded soldiers has increased accordingly. The president of the university, seeing this situation, felt compassion and, at the request of the Chinese Red Cross Society, converted the solemn and splendid auditorium of the university, which is famous in Shanghai, into a hospital and sent medical students from the university to join the work. The university implemented classes on the 23rd of this month to avoid wasting the youth who can still study. Singing together again, with a heart for benevolence, the university truly has it.</p>
<h3>Student Federation in War Zone Distributes Bread</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, students from various schools in the war zone have felt difficulties in their lives due to the impact of the war. Therefore, the United Federation of Students from various schools in the war zone was organized. A large amount of money has been raised from various parties to provide relief to refugee students. It is now known that more than 20,000 yuan has been raised and relief efforts are underway. The first step is to distribute bread to refugee students at the French University inside Jin Shenfu Road. However, they must first register at the Federation's General Office (located in Huadong Apartment, Rue Massenet, French Concession) and hold a registration certificate before going to the French University to receive the bread. Each person receives a square of bread twice a day, weighing about half a pound. As for the accommodation problem of the refugee students, negotiations have been conducted with various schools in the concession.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Association Takes on Ambulance Duties</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society, due to the intensification of the war, needs a large number of ambulances. The number of vehicles to be added will be determined at the discretion of the matter. All vehicles will be undertaken by the Coal Industry Association.</p>

<h3>The Joyful Spirit of the Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Red Swastika Society</p>
<p>There have been many people from all walks of life visiting the temporary hospital to offer comfort in recent days, but most of them are donations of food and clothing, and few are trying to bring spiritual joy to the wounded soldiers. Yesterday, the children of Mr. Ma Xingdong, one seven years old and the other five years old, visited the Second Hospital of the Red Cross Society to comfort the wounded soldiers.

<p>Important Domestic and Foreign News</p>
<h3>League of Nations to Hold General Committee Meeting Today</h3>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Rushes to Geneva</p>
<p>Will Try to Get China and Japan to Cease Fire</p>
<p>London: Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon left for Geneva last night 24 hours earlier than reported by Reuters, due to news from Geneva that the representatives of the other four powers have gathered there and will hold a meeting of the League of Nations General Committee tomorrow. The primary objective of Britain's policy in Geneva is to find a way to get China and Japan to cease fire in the next few days. However, the issues of German reparations and disarmament are also of concern. Britain believes that if the League of Nations cannot achieve a permanent solution by bringing the two countries to a ceasefire, the resulting situation will endanger the League of Nations' position and the extent of trust that various nations have in the League of Nations. It is hoped that this effort will not be undermined by behind-the-scenes conspiracies. Although there are such rumors, according to the news received by the British authorities, this is not the case. Reuters has learned from the most reliable sources that Britain's policy will continue to be to mediate in the most effective way at the earliest possible opportunity to stabilize peace in the Far East. To this end, Britain is prepared to cooperate with the United States outside the League of Nations or with any power within the League of Nations, and will not deviate from any path that can affect the League of Nations' full fulfillment of its responsibilities. Moreover, both China and Japan are now trying to avoid acknowledging the existence of war. Although the two sides have already gone to war, they both refer to it as a dispute, and diplomatic relations have not yet been severed. This is also where the hope for a ceasefire lies. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Regarding the Far East Incident</p>
<h3>United States to Issue New Declaration</h3>
<p>Reiterating the Principles of Open Door and Others</p>
<p>Preparing Diplomatic Guideline for the Future with Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) Recently, it was suggested to the U.S. State Department that the United States should issue a general declaration on the Far East incident based on the recent events in China. This matter is currently under consideration by Secretary of State Stimson. According to extremely reliable sources, the United States will indeed issue a declaration, but it will not propose any new methods or radical strategies, but will only re-emphasize the principles that the United States has always implemented, such as the open-door policy. It is believed that the United States' declaration will focus on re-applying the original policy, which was explained in the notes that the U.S. government sent to China and Japan on January 7. Based on the spirit of that policy, the United States will resolutely deny all treaties that conflict with the provisions of the open-door policy and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. This declaration is necessary to establish clear principles in advance as guidelines for future diplomatic strategies, as the completion of Japan's military actions in Shanghai will inevitably lead to problems in diplomatic relations with the United States. According to experienced observers, after the Shanghai Incident subsides, Japan will likely request mediation from Britain, the United States, and other countries before starting negotiations with China. (Guomin News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is rumored that President Hoover opposes the idea of boycotting Japan, whether implemented solely by the United States or jointly with the League of Nations. It is generally believed that President Hoover has consulted with the Senate leaders on this matter. Senate Republican leader Watson declared that he strongly opposes the United States imposing an economic blockade on Japan, regardless of whether it is implemented independently. "I want the United States to stay out of the Sino-Japanese dispute. If the member states of the League of Nations wish to take action, they are welcome to do so." (Havas Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>Foreign Secretary Explains Three Principles of Far East Policy, MacDonald Meets the King to Report on the Political Situation. The British House of Commons debated the Shanghai Incident tonight. Labour Party leader Lansbury advocated that the British government take active action, using economic or diplomatic methods to resolve the Shanghai conflict, and said that the Japanese army may be able to defeat the Chinese army, but will not obtain good results. Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon replied that the war has reached a deeply disturbing level. It is most regrettable that the League of Nations' organizational investigation team, the great powers' peace proposal of February 2, the advice to Japan on February 17, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact have all been ineffective, and that two member states of the League of Nations have actually engaged in battle. The principles of British policy are now as follows: 1. The British government will join other countries in using all its power to uphold the spiritual authority of the League of Nations. 2. Britain has indicated from the outset its willingness to mediate and end the terrible conflict. 3. The British government has a special responsibility to protect the interests of the British people in China. Britain's interests are encompassed in the words peace and trade. This is especially applicable in China. Any disruption of peace will harm trade. We do not want to seek trade through the boycott of others. Mr. Lansbury will see that the British people in the Shanghai International Settlement now feel safe and have no intention of leaving. At the same time, the League of Nations' duty is to gather information as quickly as possible. The League of Nations' handling has been impartial and recognized by both parties. It is not appropriate to make a hasty judgment before the information arrives. Simon also said that the International Settlement has very complete arrangements to protect life and property. The British government's responsibility is to find ways to stop the war and bloodshed. Former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain agreed with Simon's words. After further debate by the members, Simon claimed that Mr. Lansbury's statement that the Chinese people believe that certain countries are allied with Japan and encourage Japanese behavior is, to his knowledge, inaccurate. The House of Commons responded to the Foreign Secretary's words with cheers. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: Prime Minister MacDonald met with the King at Buckingham Palace today. Although the Prime Minister is still on sick leave at the doctor's advice, he is in constant contact with his cabinet members regarding the Shanghai Incident. The cabinet's Shanghai Incident Committee met in the House of Commons today, and the content was kept strictly confidential. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: This morning, when MacDonald entered the palace to meet with the King, he reported on the general situation of the political situation, but the Far East issue was probably not mentioned, because MacDonald did not participate in the recent cabinet discussions on this issue.

<p>Japanese Army Invades China</p>
<h3>The United States Learns a Lesson</h3>
<p>Treaties Are Mere Words and Cannot Eliminate War</p>
<p>Losses Suffered by Aggression Outweigh Military Expansion</p>
<p>Speech by U.S. Senator Leet</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Hale, Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, given the tension in the Far East, used a wireless broadcast to express his opinion that the U.S. naval equipment is far below the limits of the naval treaty. If a major accident occurs, the U.S. naval power can only be balanced with Japan. Hale also said that the naval situation in the Far East is urgent, and the occurrence of unfortunate events is quite expected, and the United States must never be on an equal or near-equal footing with Japan. After Hale's speech, Senator Leet, Chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, gave a speech advocating that the United States should maintain its current military strength. Given the changes in the Far East, it is felt that treaties and other</p>

<p>are mere words and cannot stop the war. Lee turned around and shouted loudly in the chaos, "One, we see the Chinese people fighting Japan under terrible unequal labor, and we should get a very cruel lesson in observation. From the Chinese people, we can see that the losses suffered in defeat far outweigh the losses suffered in preparation." (Guomin News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>League of Nations Special Meeting</p>
<h3>Summoning Date Approaching</h3>
<p>To Organize a Committee</p>
<p>Invite the United States, Russia, and Turkey to Participate</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council is scheduled to hold a special meeting on March 3 to discuss the Far East situation, especially the Shanghai Incident. There is currently no question of inviting the United States to participate. In the future, the Council will inevitably organize a committee and invite the United States, Russia, and Turkey to join. The rumor that the United States will participate in the Council's special meeting may have originated from this. It is expected that after a brief discussion of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Council will hand over the issue to the Political Committee for investigation and report. At that time, each country will be invited to participate with one representative from each faction. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Chinese delegation told a reporter from the Associated Press that sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Charter (i.e., economic severance with Japan) will be proposed soon. If Japan does not show a spirit of compromise at this time, China will propose economic sanctions under Article 16 at the League of Nations General Assembly. However, most people in the League of Nations currently believe that by the time the special meeting of the General Assembly is convened on March 3, the situation created by the Shanghai war will be greatly stabilized. The League of Nations General Assembly may not take any action on the implementation of sanctions. (Guomin News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Japan's Response to the League of Nations</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japan's reply to the League of Nations' application has been sent today. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>French Government</p>
<h3>Pays Attention to the Development of the Shanghai Situation</h3>
<p>But Adheres to a Policy of Non-Interference</p>
<p>(Paris) Although the French public's anxiety about the Shanghai Incident is clearly not as deep as that of Britain and the United States, the French government and its most relevant administrative departments are closely monitoring the situation. The French policy is the same as that of Britain and the United States, which is to preserve the International Settlement and the French Concession, protect its citizens, and not interfere. The resistance of the Chinese army has aroused a deep impression here. It is generally believed that the adventure undertaken by Japan is more difficult than it expected. However, in order to save face, Japan will intensify its efforts and may not be willing to cease fire and make peace after a partial failure. The French hope that the League of Nations will avoid getting involved in the vortex to the extent possible for its own interests. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Chairman of the Diplomatic Committee</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin's Talk</h3>
<p>Japan Disregards Everything</p>
<p>The League of Nations Can Hardly Ignore It</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 23rd, I visited Jiang Zuobin, Chairman of the Diplomatic Committee, and asked whether there was a possibility of implementing the economic blockade against Japan by applying for a special meeting of the League of Nations and proposing Articles 15 and 16 of the Covenant. Jiang said that the Japanese atrocities not only undermine peace in the Far East and endanger the global balance of power, but have recently violated international conventions and regulations, and that if all countries do not address this situation, it would be tantamount to tearing up the sacred covenant that maintains world peace and indirectly challenging the world. The League of Nations, in order to maintain its own dignity and prestige, cannot ignore this matter. Judging from the recent warning issued by the League of Nations to Japan alone, the wording is strict and unprecedented, which shows that the League of Nations fundamentally distrusts Japan and considers it a nation that has lost its rationality. However, Japan does not know how to repent and intends to expand the dangerous situation to achieve its ambition to invade territory. It is expected that at this critical moment, the League of Nations, in order to maintain the dignity of all covenants and its own authority, will definitely accept the implementation of Articles 15 and 16 to take direct and effective joint measures to eliminate the war in the Far East and maintain the safety of mankind.

<p>United States Celebrates</p>
<h3>National Father's Birthday Commemoration</h3>
<p>Reminding People of the Instructions of a Century Ago</p>
<p>(Washington) Today is the bicentennial of the birth of George Washington, the first President of the United States. A grand celebration was initiated by US President Hoover, and American expatriates abroad were also inspired to celebrate. However, the unrest in most parts of the world and the political and financial difficulties have made American politicians recall Washington's instructions and have the feeling of closing the door, guarding themselves, and not asking about foreign affairs. Washington gave a speech in Congress in 1796 after two terms as President, warning Americans not to seek trouble by forming alliances with other countries, roughly saying that the practical training we should follow in diplomacy is to promote business relations and strive to reduce political relations. As for the tasks we have already promised, we should practice them earnestly, but we only hope to stop there and not increase them. Europe has many important interests that have nothing to do with us, so Europeans often have disputes over this. If our country changes its usual policy or forms an alliance to resist Ding, it would be unwise to artificially tie ourselves up in it. This instruction has always been followed by Americans. This is also the reason why their diplomatic policies have often been passive in recent years. Also, the US Senate's disapproval of the League of Nations Charter and the vigorous opposition of a small number of senators to joining the International Court of Justice are all due to this.

<h3>Anniversary of Red Army Founding</h3>

Army Minister Voroshilov issued an oath, warning all soldiers to make the greatest preparations to defend the country, stating that the bloodshed in China today is due to the fact that after a critical situation has occurred between China and Japan, the orators of the general bourgeoisie are still calmly giving peace speeches in Geneva. At present, both the East and the West have plans to interfere in Soviet Russia, on the one hand, creating society and public opinion, and on the other hand, organizing White Russian teams in order to attack Soviet Russia, and the White Russians in the Far East, backed by certain imperialists, are openly planning to drive out Soviet Russia. Also, today's Red Star Daily, the organ of the Army Department, published an editorial warning the enemies of Soviet Russia that if they try to attack Soviet Russia, they will meet the Red Army and the strongest resistance from the people of the whole country.

<h3>Central National Government Enlarged Memorial Week</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) At 9 am on the 22nd, the Central Party Headquarters and various organs of the National Government held the Third Enlarged Memorial Week in Luoyang. Members of the Central Committee Lin Sen, Zhang Ji, Ye Chucang, Tan Zhen, Li Liejun, Zhang Lizhu, Miao Peicheng, Li Ciwen, Bai Yunti, Shao Lizi, and others, as well as three or four hundred officials from various central organs, attended. After Ye Chucang, as chairman, led the ceremony, Zhang Ji reported, saying that the Premier paid great attention to the development of the Northwest throughout his life. Now, in the Premier's Memorial Week, he will talk about the development of the Northwest. The current national crisis was foreseen by the Premier during his lifetime. Before national defense and military affairs are completed, imperialists can invade us at any time. The Premier's intention was to develop the Northwest first. Only when the development of the Northwest is successful can we resist the aggression of all imperialists. This time, Japan launched a large-scale attack in Shanghai, destroying our production organs as much as possible. All our people should realize that in the future, large production organs must be established in the Northwest. The elements needed to establish a country in modern times are mainly coal, iron, and oil. We have a large amount of reserves in the Northwest, but unfortunately, the Premier's 100,000-mile railway plan has not been realized, resulting in inconvenient transportation and the inability to develop the Northwest plan. Now that the central government has moved to Luoyang to work, we should urgently refresh our spirits and do something to develop the Northwest. As far as our history is concerned, there have always been accompanying capitals in addition to the capital. We can now designate Luoyang or Xi'an as the accompanying capital. Afterwards, we can follow the Premier's legacy and carry out concrete development work in the Northwest. When the Second Plenary Session is held on March 1st, my personal opinion is that we should establish the status of an accompanying capital in Luoyang or Xi'an in order to give the people a good impression and concentrate the talents and capital of the whole country in the Northwest. Since the Qin and Han Dynasties, our national character has moved south, from the Yangtze River to the Pearl River to Nanyang. It can be said that we are a nation running south. In the future, we must change the tendency to run south to return north, concentrating the talents and capital of the whole country to develop the Northwest, so that Chinese culture can be revived. This is our responsibility for realizing the Premier's legacy. Other matters that should be paid attention to at present are how to do some practical work for the people of Luoyang, helping the local area promote local autonomy, organize civil groups, be pragmatic, first make Luoyang a model, and then promote it to the whole country. This is also a point of view in today's report. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
