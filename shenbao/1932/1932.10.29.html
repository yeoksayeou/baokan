<p>時評</p>
<h3>現階段中之日本外交　翰</h3>
<p>目前日本之企圖透骨言之爲如何鞏固在東北所造成之地位就其傅統的大陸政策上無非從「併呑朝鮮論」進爲「鮮滿一元論」而亟欲在現階段中完成其「鮮滿一元論」之目的現階段中日本外交之意義如是而已。</p>
<p>日本之併呑東北已成爲確切不移之事實然而斯一炸彈之呑食足以激起蘇美以及世界之不安故日本欲如何確保佔領東北之安全實爲目前朝野處心積慮之焦點明年總預算數字之突破歷年紀錄海陸空軍之積極擴充雖財政如何窘迫經濟如何恐慌貿易如何衰落農村如何危險皆可暫置腦後以致日本内地農村中有以草根樹皮爲主要食料之餔餓莩而軍費之預</p>
<p>算　超出總預算額半數之上如此矛盾現象之對照足見日本已在積極準備顯欲孤注一擲然而展念前途日本亦殊惶慮備戰之説或亦故壯聲而已苟能在不必費重大犧牲以外獲得良好之結果者日本亦何樂而不從故日本對外之應付其手段仍在外交、</p>
<p>日本外交之現階段可以國聯調查團報告書之發表爲起點内田康哉對調查團在東京之訪問已充分顯露日本之直覺而報告書發表以後齊藤内閣且有露骨反對之態度未十日而日本之外交方針復生劇變從消極的退出國聯論轉爲積極的抵抗國聯論著名「滿蒙通」之松岡洋右已啣命赴日内瓦而所謂「内田外交之陣容」亦在積極整飭中駐俄德意三國大使之更動尤爲整飭外交陣容之先聲是則日本在外上急轉直下似已準備總動員矣。</p>
<p>日本外交之對象爲何曰一切排除日本大陸政策之障礙是也故日本外交之中心問題實在如何剷除斯種障礙國聯調查團之報告書盡儘不利於我國亦未必十分有利於日本美國今日雖因選舉關係暫持緘默亦欲靜待國聯之態度俾可以實現聯英法以制日之政策故目前日本之眼中釘一爲國聯一爲美國自屬無疑况美法之聯合前　有一度之宣傳日本原欲藉聯法以制國聯今法旣有猶豫之暗示日本更將處於孤立之地位日本爲衝破斯孤立之難關計惟有在外交上另關一新的途徑。</p>
<p>日本外交之新途徑爲何曰速謀日俄關係之進展斯一外交策之决定誠如最近日本「勞動新聞」之所言爲一種「欺詐的外交」結果可以一舉而兩得一方面藉聯俄之空氣以緩和國聯之對日他方面以日俄關係之親密。隔離俄美之接近繼續維持「俄不願戰美不敢戰」之形勢於是日本在東北之地位可以逐漸鞏固揆諸最近消息日本外務省之動作似已向斯新途徑以前進日俄僞間不侵犯條約之醖釀冀希俄國承認僞國之要求松岡假道西伯利亞赴歐將順便在俄先行談判之宣傳在在可以證明日本在現階段中外交之動向甚至駐俄德意本國大使之更動就我人過敏之神經而觀察亦無非欲藉歐陸爭覇中之德意兩國以牽制英法在各國對於遠東外交非常沉默之時期而日本外交反而急轉直下勢甚活躍則日本外交的新途徑之確定亦可知矣。</p>
<p>將來如何當有事實證明我人固臆測惟今可以斷定者我國在任何方面觀察必爲錯雜的國際關係下之犧牲品而在縱横捭闔之中收漁翁之利者未必爲日本而爲靠近北冰洋之白熊丨蘇俄蘇俄利用日美對抗之形勢。確立舉足輕重之地位對日對美皆可以待價而沽今日儘可以親日明仍可以聯美衹須促成二期實業計劃之完成一切手段均可不顧其外交手腕之巧妙爲任何國所不及請拭目而待二期實業計劃之完成以覘蘇俄之顔色可也。</p>

<p>自由談	九三老人馬相伯語錄鐘表眼鏡來自外國考  徐景賢　　據説··滬蘇曩時鐘錶店，常懸一個黑袍人像··有人講是利瑪　，因爲來中國傅敎，曾將自鳴鐘進貢··算是開創中國鐘錶業的始祖，所以敬他！一　傅聞是如此。鐘錶對中國很有貢獻；不然我們那能知道「八字」的準確時辰！固然，算命測八字都是迷信··但是我們要知道準確時間，好遵守時間來作息，是緊要的！　　還有，眼鏡一物，中國幾時才有的？也得考究！因此提到乾隆名士趙甌北的詩鈔。原來西洋敎士，明末清初來華，學行見重於當時，並有許多詩文紀載的。如甌北詩鈔、也有例可查。　　一·同北墅漱田觀西洋樂器詩。「郊園散直歸，訪奇番人宅、中有虬鬚叟，出門敬迓客，來從大西洋，官授羲和職，年深習漢語，無煩舌人譯，引登天主堂，有象繪素壁，云是彼周孔，崇奉自古昔。」隨後詠怎樣觀星聽樂，結稱··「始知天地大，到處有開闢，域内多墟拘，儒外人物格！」等語，頗有古風詩意！　　二，初用眼鏡詩。首述不知愛惜目力，目眩眵後幸得眼鏡，「横橋向鼻跨」，「功賽補天　」！隨稱考究來歷··相傅宣德年，來自番舶駕，�内府賜老臣，貴値兼金價。初本嵌玻璃，薄若紙新砑。中土遞仿造，水晶亦流亞。始識創物智，不盡出華夏！」　　前在北京，見老人物，有一副好水晶眼鏡，説要藏在身上，纔是「活」的··若離置多時，便要模湖了，眞令人稀罕！秋郊憑弔記  周才良　　丨奇恥未雪，慘痛莫忘丨　　予欲滬濱戰區久矣，卒卒迄鮮暇晷，日者適値休沐復得老友朱君桔泉爲伴，鬯遊竟日，感觸良多，歸就所憶，聊誌鴻爪。　　是日予等初由此間北站搭乘長途汽車至江灣，沿實山路越鐵道向西北行，所經各路，類皆爲昔日閘北之商業中心，而今則廢墟櫛比。新建房屋，尙寥寥可數，其間當以商務印書館舊址一帶爲最慘，刧灰邱積，時尙有飄至車廂者。街左東方圖書館之殘垣，猶危立路側，搖搖欲墮，努力文化，結果若斯，可嘆也。繼車經立逹學園及中大商學院等處，刦餘殘迹，均歷歷如昨，最後車止於勞働大學之墻東，下車後即見校前　立之總理紀念塔，彈痕密若蜂窼，遙望門内庭𨻶植立之總理銅像，亦幾毀滅至模糊莫辨，私忖中山先生在天有靈，當亦不忍默爾而息。旋走江灣之西大街，沿途所見市房被焚殆盡，（據該地人云，全鎭如此，）及抵市梢之牛郎廟，略作休憩，時廟祝爲予等道遊廟後，得視在今春倭軍佔領該鎭時所掘之戰壕、厥狀猶覺可怖。渠並遙指離廟址約二里許之水泥砲壘五六所，望之已叢草蔓生·據云，皆爲倭軍瀕行時所建者，予意殆必爲若蜚妄思捲土重來之表示。繼而重返車站，另搭淞滬蒸汽車赴吳淞，時方正午，遂謀果腹，餐畢，乃雇人力車往砲台灣遊覽，刻許，始抵目的地，即見靠近石塘所建立之無線電臺鐵架，已被毀倒地，而附近田畝，亦復崎嶇不平，因念該地劇戰時之慘狀，當必有不忍言者。旋赴海灘小坐，獲覩砲台遺址草叢中，尙置有毁砲二尊，風雨剥落，已非舊觀諦視半晌，不覺喟然而歎曰，「似此國防窳劣，孰能禦侮，設今春抗敵而非忠勇如十九軍者，予又安得至今日而重臨斯土哉？」維時適遙見倭國商輪ＸＸ丸，自黄浦江疾駛而東，汽笛鳴鳴，似與潮聲相酬答，斜陽逼射，更不勝破碎山河之感，俄而暮鴉四起，遂作師計，途中嘗經爲抗日而犧牲之烈士暮多處，類皆荒土一坯，肅然憑弔，倚覺淒凉，縱目四顧，猶多瓦礫，從知創巨痛深，復原誠非易易。及抵滬寓，已萬家燈火時矣。劣根性  閣重樓　　丨何日化除　　要是有一家失火，除過那店裏的主人和救火員外，其他在塲的觀衆，差不多都是希望那火越燒越大，纔得看一個痛快！上次南京路大火，而先施永安的屋頂票却片刻售完，這就是一個舉例。　　如果有兩個人在路上因高視闊步而相撞，那就會同時相駡起來丨或者有時因甲不當心而撞了乙，那甲也要會先開口駡乙没有眼睛。前天我經過河南路，看見一部黄包車翻了身，因而車子裏坐的女人　翻了身，旁邊的人於是都拍手歡呼起來，那時有許多人跑到車子旁邊去看，却到底没有一個人伸手去扶。　　在火車裏或者電車裏，一個人總是想佔據兩個人的坐位，雖然説自已所需要的只是一人坐位的面積，然而總以得到大一倍的面積爲快…………　　人性有惡有善，但是那一種劣根性據説是人人都有的，尤其是東方的民族，不過我總希望它有化除的一天！談談大風堂所藏書畫展覽會  孤鸞　　我們在上海藝術界中，要多尋幾個書畫高明兼精鑑别的朋友，眞是不容易了，不是作品很好，偏對於鑑古，毫無興味，毫無把握，便是眼光很不差，而自已不能動手，在普通人心理，手和眼的進步，是應該成正比例的，其實書畫能夠好，或者還可靠幾分天才，説是「生而知之者」，這鑑别一回事，却絲毫不能取巧，抽象的藝術美不必説，辨别印鑑的眞贋，顔色墨澤的新舊，印泥的粗細，那一樣不要學識和經騐？單就紙來説説，有硬黄紙，澄清唐繭紙，内庫紙，明紙，清初紙，麻布紙，皮紙；紙　的闊狹，質料的優劣，一代有一代的制度，是假借不來，要有一項研究得不精，不客氣就做了假内行；况且中匣人天生喜歡冒充，孔二先生他還要託制稱王，假造一部春秋頑呢，所以　其昌的畫，陳眉公會假，趙文度會假，沈子居會假，不但後人，同時便要假，不但門外，門内還要假，這呌鑑當的人，多麽難分别呢？　　我在上海十年中，認識的書畫朋友雖不少，要兼有上面兩項資格的，除了狄平子，黄賓虹，吳湖帆，張善孖大千兄弟，眞也想不出别的人了，我和張大千認識得最早，他的藝術作風，和鑑賞目光，我也曉得格外明晰一些，他自已擅長畫的是石濤，漸江，梅翟山，一派的黄山山水，和張大風，唐六如，一派的人物，但他收藏却不限定這幾個範圍，他所有的書畫，當然比不來龐萊臣，程霖生，等大資本家，但是他却能夠「寗缺無濫」，以「少許勝人多許」就是大千這人，太會用錢了，到了經濟閙恐慌的時候，没有法子，便賣舊書畫，在一方面説，我們自已喜歡的東西，一天要賣掉他，似乎總有些「英雄氣短」但是别一方面説，古人的名跡，本來要傅播天地間，根本不能占爲私有，那没「楚弓楚得」，大千也可告無罪了。　　今年大千因爲他哥哥善孖病了幾個月，一總没有出門，現在善孖的病好了，他又想出去跑跑，俞劍華從華山回來，説華山好，他就想到西安去，鄭曼青説雁宕山好，他就想到甌東去，這一　路費没有地方出，又只好在古人身上打算了！本月二十七日超至三十一日止，他在華龍路八十號開古書畫展覽會，有二百多件出品，除掉八大石濤是留著不賣，請人欣賞的、此外有「唐太宗草書卷」·「蘇東坡寫詩卷」，「梅道人竹譜卷」，趙子昂寫的「手卷」，畫的山水立幅，黄鶴山樵的山水堂幅，徐天池，陳白陽，陳老運，金冬心，等精品，可算美不勝收，這多是預備忽痛割愛的。到了這幾天我想參觀的人一定多，看了這大風堂收藏的精，一定會聯想到他兄弟倆作品的美，那就可證明我上面説「兼有兩項格」的話不是替他吹，我們就可送他一句古人成語「二難并」了。入關郵侣　（二五）  求幸福主　　也不曉得睡了多少時候，忽然車身一震動，似猛觸在什麽山崖上直要壁立了起來，隨又向後一挫，天崩地塌般發了一聲巨響，車中人便一個個像滾西瓜般跌跌撞撞全從睡夢中驚醒。他倆因爲互相抱持着，幸而没曾跌到車板上，忽睜開惺忪的眼睛向四下一望，郤仍是滿目漆黑，看不見什麽。只覺得車子是停住了，一般人在車上瞎亂，並聽得車外曠野中吹來幾陣劈拍的槍聲。　　忙亂了一陣，那坐在車門口的人，忽地看出將他們當充罪犯管押的日本兵，已不在車上，才有人敢驚呼着道··「這定是遇了義勇軍的襲擊啦！日本兵也許是逃啦！可惡！這條污七」八糟的奉山路，本來義勇軍常常潛來毀壤軌道，給他們重大的打擊，爲我們中華民族吐一口不平之氣的。他們久已不敢在黑夜裏行車，偏此次送我們郵員入關，又要在黑夜試一試，莫不是明明想坑我們麽？但我們大可放心，我知道義勇軍只專門誓死抗敵？决不侵害我們自家同胞的，稍停，若義勇軍眞來了，我們一致歡迎他，最好莫若也跟他們去救國抗日，收復失地。　　這個驚人的消息一傅開來，車上陡又起了一片歡呼。並奸像暗中還另有個人在挨着座兒發傅單，一張張的薄紙，塞在各人的懹裡或手上。魯伯勤接得了一張，忙劃燃一支火柴在車角倫看，只見那上面用木版印刷了兩行單簡的文字··　　「我們義勇軍歡送在東北力保郵權奮鬥到底的郵員諸君入關。諸君已盡了最後的責任了！」我們郤尙須在此東北長期奮鬥，不逹到炮復故土的目的不止。敬請諸君於入關後代我們義勇軍向國人請命，速給與我們義勇軍以精神及物質的種種的援助！」　　魯伯勤正𠸄息着，四外的槍聲郤停止了。半小時後，日本兵和滿洲國奉山路的職員，才蹣跚的上了車。這些無用的東西，聽了有義勇軍來了，就赶忙逃下車去躱着；及見義勇軍已走了，再上車來却會對這般與俘囚差不多的郵員們撤威出氣。亂駡了一頓，又惡狠狠地用手　燈照着再檢查一番，幸而那張的傅單的紙很薄，各人全揑成一團塞到口裡去，没被他查出來，才又開車前行。第二天午前十一時到了榆關，下了奉山路的日本車，换乘了中華民國北寗路特爲歡迎郵員而早已開到在此等候的專車，就向北平直駛。</p>

<p>，那裏能像現在的摩登男女呢？　　到了相當的時期，不管三七二十一　　的結婚起來，但是這一對小夫婦，面都不曾會過，怎麽辦呢！於是親友們想出鬧新房的妙法，來增進他們的感情。　　其實這舉動的動機也没有什麽好，因爲這對小夫婦若大家面貌相當，皮氣相若，那你也不用去鬧也會好的。反之，是越鬧越不好。　　後來不知怎的，漸漸變成鬧新房是結婚時必要的舉動，是報復的良機，而且非此不足以助興。　　設甲是已婚的，到乙處參加婚禮，甲是已婚的可盡量的鬧，丙雖未婚也鬧，待丙結婚時乙便乘機報復。社會惡習如此！奈何！　　而且鬧新房常常發生意外，都市還文前些，若内地鄉村無智識者，乘酒興之餘，盡量作無意識野蠻舉動，因此新郎與賀客發生衝突，甚至於訴訟，這種增加小夫婦感情的舉動，反而失却朋友的友誼，何苦呢？　　再者現在摩登結婚，一般摩登的少年少女也未把惡習除掉，不過把「親嘴」改Ｋｉｓｓ吧了！眞腐化到極點！而且他們自由戀愛而結婚，感情本很融洽，何必多此一舉呢？　　上海是新潮流的交流，青年的思想中竟未把這些惡流的習慣冲去，不知作何解釋！生活的鞭子可憐的二房東  島生　　年夜，夜半從睡夢中醒來，總聽到前樓裏有種「歪拉」「沙碌」的雜聲，這種聲音經我考察的結果，原來是二房東的特殊工作丨他在改造，修理或製造着古董貨，玉器銅器等等。　　二房東、是一個四十來歲的中年人。從他面部的和善表情看來，是個飽經世故的人物。和他相値的時候，總是以微笑着的臉色和你招呼。　　一天，他忽然到後樓來和我談話，也可以説是訴苦。他説··　　「先生！請你原諒啊·我是個窮商人。我做古董生意，差不多有二十多年了，古董生意本是極有出息的一種職業。可是，我操着二十多年，竟無一點積蓄，爲的一家的開銷太大了。平時所賺來的錢，只夠全家的生活費用」説到這裏，他吁了幾口氣。　　我有五個孩子丨三個男的，二個女的丨大的男孩剛十五歲，去年春間，便送到一　鞋舖裏做學徒去了。二男和三男，都在學校裏讀書，等到年紀略大了一點，也得送到什麽店舖裏做學徒，因爲窮人根本没有使子弟受高敎育的能力啊！至於，兩個女的還小，最幼的還在哺乳。先生，你所看見的那幾個齷齪孩子，便是我的子女了。連我和老妻和四個小孩，一共六個人，六個人每天的生活費用，全恃我一人的收入支付，在這個年頭，使我感到極度的困難」又略停頓了一會，嘆了一口氣，「自從東洋人的亂子一鬧，古董貨就無人顧問，生意清淡到極度，我的收入便因而鋭减了。可是，一家的生活費用，却不因我收入鋭减而隨着减低其耗用。良以，我家的生活狀態，已苦到不堪再緊縮的程度了。因此，爲維持一家的生活起見，便不得不夜以繼日的爲人家修理古董或改造古董了。明知道夜間的工作，足以妨礙先生的睡眠，但也出於不得已。先生丨請你多多恕罪」，説罷，又連連地打恭作揖，弄得我不知怎樣對答他纔是。　　無妨！無妨……」我祇簡單地這樣答復他。　　現在，每夜夜半醒來，二房東的工作聲音，依舊響着，「歪拉」「沙碌」地響着。我不但不覺得它的可　，而且認爲是非常悲惻的呻吟，令人同情。</p>

<p>學堂寫眞失望  孫源　　在現在學校貴族化之下、窮措大的我本没有進大學的福分，但爲了虚榮，竟昧了良心到Ｓ校ＸＸ院去報名了。學費是五十元，雜費是五元，入學費是十元，還有什麽費不必在這裏開一詳單，總括一句，百元左右。東借西挪，如數湊足向會計科一塞，領到了入學證，上課證；於是眼巴巴等上課日期。好容易課程表貼出來了丨　　「Ｓ先生！爲什麽ＸＸ學没有？」我問院長。　　「我們没有請到敎授」他的答覆。　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　X　　噹噹的上課鐘敲了許多時，敎授還没來，大家坐着望黑板，各人心中都在猜想未來的敎授是怎麽好，怎麽有學問，不馬虎。　　半個鐘頭以後、敎室門口才發現了S院長，後面跟着一位西裝敎授。院長介紹敎授的尊姓大名後，照例説上一大套捧塲話。院長退出後，這位X敎授好像以爲院長介紹得太不完備，太不詳細，所以又補充好幾句，意思是説他不但如Ｓ院長所説是前Ｘ大敎授，他以前還在北平當過Ｘ大敎授。過後，他舉起一本厚厚西裝書，説是他，著作的内容非常好，非常完備，讀了這本書，對於ＸＸ學就非常有研究了。最後，他説希望同學們每人去買一本作參考。這樣他替自已銷了二十幾本書，版税可以多抽一點了。　　介紹好了這本書後，他説他有要事要早退課。好，　　　第一課就馬馬虎虎罷丨　　隔日，上第二課，打了鐘後，我們照例坐在敎室裏等敎授。過了好一會才有個書記來報告説Ｘ公館來電話Ｘ先生没空。大家就一哄而散。　　我忽然想到利用這時間到圖書館去看書罷　可是圖書館的門是緊閉着，我跑去問院長··　　「Ｓ先生，圖書館可以去看書嗎」？　　「上課時間，不能看」。　　「那麽，我們没有課，怎麽辦。不能看書空等嗎」？　　「圖書館裏也有人在上課。我本想不要用圖書館，偏偏你們還要問圖書館。」　　啊！Ｓ院長到底會做生意丨辦學校丨的人，多麽會打盤算，圖書館可以兼當敎室。但圖書費却要收的，我眞佩服他的手段高明。　　上了二星期課，倒有五次的敎授不到。敎授不到，到圖書館去看書又不成，只得回家去。可是早回家，麻煩就來了；母親終問爲什麽這樣早回來，我眞不知怎樣答覆，以前未入校前，不是對母親説過學校是怎麽好，將來怎麽有希望嗎？現在呢？我只有啞子吃黄連説不出苦。後來，怕母親查問，就是没課，我也不敢早回家去。只好替巡捕房盡些義務巡閲一下馬路了。　　唉！這是敎育，這是大學敎育！社會一角一個職業界的女性  蓓蕾　　這一天晚上，我懐着滿腔苦悶，到梧桐葉落的十字街頭去徘徊，在寫着比「道地藥材」四字還大的「當」字之門，倐地闖出了一個女郎，一個很摩登而又嬌小的女郎，手裏拿着一個不十分大的包裏，那情形，很明顯地象徵了長生庫裏受到委曲的失望，可是多麽奇怪呢？她是一個摩登女郎啊丨　　坦白地説一句··我對於這樣的女性，眞有點不了解，我疑惑，我憐惜；一個能夠穿得這樣漂亮的女郎而竟會進典當，她，吾以爲至少是一個不尋常的女性，於是我開始卑鄙地窺視他人的秘密了，　　她先前似乎不曾注意到有人跟蹤她，很急迫而又窘苦地漫步着，不久之後，從她屢次回眸的經騐中，她知道這時候有一個人在發生不規則的探視了，她於是漸次走得快，希望我會脱離她的視綫，我呢？憑良心説··絶對不忍監視一個走到窮人所必然走的女性之舉止，可是因爲她充分地摩登了，使我不禁的亦步亦趨，一心想犧牲些時光看到她這樣一種人的奇特行爲，所以，走到另一　「當」字之門的時候，吾故意地隠匿了，果然，不滿十分鐘之後，她從長生庫裏出來了，手裏的包裹已然没有，得意而又慌張地向四週望了一望，大踏步就走，我再跟，我希望能夠知道她是怎樣一個人？　　行行復行行，從燈光暗澹的一角走到路人擁擠的一角了，她走進ＸＸ市場，我也跟進了去，我看到她遇見她的幾個女友，同樣地摩登而活潑，説笑了幾句，也就分了手，於是她跨進照相館拿照相，進百貨商店購手提袋，又進香粉店買了一瓶法國香水；此外電影明星照片，糖果……手裏拿滿了紙包，已一改剛才「空空如也」的氣慨了，可是我眞發現到奇蹟，一個摩登女郎進典當，已至少是不尋常，她却還能夠於不滿一小時中把質來的代價漂亮地花費，毫不吝惜地購買不需要的物件，這件事，確實使我得到都市女性的生存之秘密了，她是怎樣地酷愛虚榮啊丨　　然而，她本身是怎樣的一個人呢？當然我還是不曾知道，所以在她買好東西開步走時，我再跟着她跑，再從擁擠的一角走到暗澹的一角，她終於在「樓高五層」的ＸＸ局跚跚地走進去了，接着的是回眸一笑，唉，奇了丨　　於是，我由ＸＸ局而推知她是有相當職業的女子，她在理决不至於窘困到如此，可是她竟爲了購買一切不需要的物件而進長生庫了，　　這就是都市的女性嗎？神秘極了！隨便談談説説笑笑  怡怡館主　　一天，愛兒的弟弟，同他的哥哥丨愛兒丨，在他們的姑夫家裏吃了飯回來，他們的父親，問愛兒道··「今天姑夫家裏，有幾桌飯？有什麽别的客人没有」？愛兒答道··「除了我和弟弟以外，别有没有什麽客人，所以只有一桌飯，和姑夫們一桌吃的。」時愛兒的弟弟，站在旁邊，聽他的哥哥丨愛兒丨説，「只有一桌，」不覺奇怪道··「咦·共有兩桌，你怎麽説「只有一桌」呢？那面鏡子裏，不是還有一桌嗎？」　　Ｘ　　　　　Ｘ　　　　　Ｘ　　某甲，在開唱留聲機器，唱的那張片子，呌「空城計」，其時他的一個兒子，站在一邊聽着，於是某甲問他的兒子道··「你可知道這在城樓上唱的是誰」？他的兒子答道··「是諸葛亮」。於是某甲又問道··「諸葛亮是那裏人呢」？他的兒子想了想答道··「諸葛亮是北平人」。某甲聽了詫異，於是再問道··「你怎樣知道諸葛亮是北平人呢？」他的兒子答道··「因爲我細聽唱這戲的嗓音，是北平音，所以説諸葛亮是北平人了。」　　Ｘ　　　　　Ｘ　　　　　　Ｘ　　先生寫了一個俗寫「覔」字，問學生道··「你們可有識得這是一個什麽字嗎」？時學生中有某生，起立答道··「這個字的讀音，和蜜糖的「蜜字」一樣的。」先生於是又問道··「那麽，什麽解釋呢」？某生向那字瞧了瞧，又想了想道··；「是不見的解釋，因爲這個字是「不」和「見」兩個字所拚成的。」先生聽了微笑道··「這倒虧你見得到，想得出，但是，却解釋錯了，原來這個字，是和正體寫的「覓」字一樣，作尋東西的「尋」字解釋的啊。」某生聽了搶着道··「是啊！我方纔的解釋，並不錯啊！只因爲東西不見了，所以纔要尋哩。」公佈欄上海第一特區地方法院　　▲刑事第一審判决　匯司捕房訴張阿三搶奪案（主文）張阿三搶奪二罪每罪處有期徒刑八月執行徒刑一年裁判確定前　押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲總巡捕房訴謝林生竊盜案（主文）謝林生結夥竊盜累犯處有期徒刑一年裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲老閘捕房訴張恫求搶奪案（主文）張恫求搶奪累犯處有期徒刑二年裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲老閘捕房訴徐王氏等鴉片案（主文）徐王氏意圖販賣持有鴉片處有期徒刑六月併科罰金三百元裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日罰金如不完納以三元折算一日易科監禁邵金昌帮助意圖販賣持有鴉片處有期徒刑三月緩刑二年鴉片十包重一磅特製藏置鴉片之人力車一輛没收▲老閘捕房訴時仁川等略誘案（主文）時仁川朱阿四意圖營利略誘未滿二十歲之男子脱離享有親權之人各處有期徒刑二年六月裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日朱朱氏無罪▲總巡捕房訴狄白榮强盜案（主文）狄白榮結夥三人以上强盜處有期徒刑三年六月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲新閘捕房訴陳阿榮竊盜案（主文）陳阿榮夜間侵入竊盜累犯一罪處有期徒刑二年裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日鑰匙一把没收▲新閘捕房訴張友根鴉片案（主文）張友根帮助意圖販賣持有鴉片代用品一罪處有期徒刑六月併科罰金二百元裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日罰金如易科監禁以二元折算一日紅丸九包重約四磅半没收▲虹口捕房訴楊西子竊盜案（主文）楊西子累犯夜間侵人竊盜未遂處有期徒刑一年裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲新閘捕房訴邱榮華竊盜案（主文）邱榮華夜間侵入住宅竊盜一罪處有期徒刑六月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲普陀路捕房訴張小勳搶奪案（主文）張小勳搶奪一罪處有期徒刑六月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲嘉興路捕房訴張三寳竊盜案（主文）張三寳結夥夜間侵入竊盜三罪每罪處有期徒刑一年應執行有期徒刑一年六月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲楊樹浦捕房訴劉大泡子鴉片案（主文）劉大泡子販賣鴉片代用品處有期徒刑六月併科罰金二百元裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日罰金如易科監禁以二元折算一日紅丸等類照單没收▲新閘捕房訴王子雲搶奪案（主文）王子雲搶奪一罪處有期徒刑八月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲本院檢察官訴葉耀華等脱逃案（主文）王包氏卽李寳球脱逃處有期徒刑三月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日李錢氏便利脱逃處有期徒刑三月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日葉耀華因過失致囚人脱逃處罰金六十元如易科監禁以二元折算一日緩刑二年▲匯山捕房訴費脱納考蘭司卜旦柯即卜旦考支侵占案（主文）費脱納考蘭司卜旦柯即卜旦考支背信一罪處有期徒刑四月併科罰金三百元裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日罰金如易科監禁以三元折算一日▲匯山捕房訴顧阿四等鴉片案（主文）顧阿四帮助以館舍供人吸食鴉片處有期徒刑六月併科罰金六十元裕阿福竺亭山吳永木吸食鴉片各處有期徒刑一月併科罰金二十元裁判確定前覊押日數各以二日抵徒刑一日罰金如易科監禁各以二元折算一日烟具等件照單没收▲新閘捕房訴顧林氏等鴉片案（主文）顧林氏意圖營利以館舍供人吸食鴉片一罪減處有期徒刑六月陳生金强阿福浦和尙共同吸食鴉片累犯一罪各處有期徒刑四月張振香共同吸食鴉片一罪减處有期徒刑一月裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日紅丸烟渣烟具没收▲總巡捕房訴王阿三詐欺案（主文）王阿三連續詐財未遂處有期徒刑一年裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日（以上十月二十八日）　　▲民事第一審判决　繆耀初與沈文記行沈漢文等欠欵案（主文）沈文記行沈漢文應償還原告洋七百四十二元五角秦步　應償還原告洋四百三十七元八角徐海記行徐海山應償還原告洋五百三十二元七角五分張成記行張墜成應償還原告洋二百七十元○六角王阿福應償還原告洋二百三十四元三角樂芝記行樂正方應償還原告洋三百二十六元八角樂正記行樂正仁應償還原告洋二百十二元四角廣利昌號印補坤應償還原告洋四百二十一元二角潘林記行潘鶴林應償還原告洋六百三十七元八角八分及各自起訴日起至執行終丁日止週年五釐利息原告其餘之訴駁回訴訟費用由被告等比例負担▲熒昌翻砂廠與明昌機器廠貨欵案（主文）被告應償還原告票欵洋一百七十九元并貨欵洋三十五元九角二分訴訟費用由被告負担▲孟格而生與朱阿海等借欵案（主文）被告朱阿海朱林春許新應連帶償還原告借欵二百元訴訟費用由被告朱阿海朱林春許新連帶負担▲孫葉紅蕙與李崑良借欵及財物案（主文）被告應償還原告借欵二百五十元其餘殊訴駁回訴訟費用由被告負担▲明　新與　　之等欠欵案（主文）被告等應連帶償還原告洋四百元訟費由被告等連帶負担▲盧兆鴻與葛陳氏等欠欵案（主文）被告葛陳氏應償還原告洋五百元並自民國十九年七月三十日起至執行終了日止按月一分之利息如就抵押物及其財産執行不足額或不能執行時應由被告單瀛輝代爲償還訟費由被告葛陳氏負擔▲阿巧生與徐鼎榮等欠欵案（主文）被告徐鼎榮應償還原告洋六百元此欵每月拔還洋三十元至還清爲止如不能償還時由被告徐佩珍袁益美代爲償還訟費由被告徐鼎榮負擔▲王張氏與黄順生欠欵案（主文）原告之訴駁回訟費由原告負擔▲沈袁氏與陳孝哉欠欵案（主文）被告應償還原告洋九十元並自民國十六年九月二十五日起至本年九月二十四日止按月一分二釐之利息原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由被告負担▲中國國貨銀行與吳君立欵項案（主文）被告應償還原告本利銀一千二百十九元七角四分并就本銀八百九十六元八角六分自本年九月二十二日起至執行終結日止給付按月一分二厘之利息原告其餘之訴駁回訴訟費用由被告負担▲斯文洋行與許蘭生房租並遷讓案（主文）被告應支付原告房租九十六元並遷讓房屋返還原告本件關於遷讓部分應予假執行訴訟費用由被告負擔▲張福順與劉裕良賠償案（主文）被告應賠償原告損害洋二百四十七元七角二分其餘之訴駁回訴訟費用當事人各自負擔▲羅細亞保險公司與李翰卿保險費案（主文）被告所欠原告銀一千四百六十一兩○二分又洋十八元七角四分應卽償還銀七百六十一兩０二分洋十八元七角四分其餘銀七百兩應自本年十一月起每月拔還銀一百兩

        <h1>1932.10.29</h1>
<h3>Japan's Current Diplomacy - Han</h3>
<p>Currently, Japan's ambition, to put it bluntly, is to solidify its position in the Northeast. In terms of its traditional continental policy, it is nothing more than progressing from the "Annexation of Korea Theory" to the "Korea-Manchuria Unity Theory," and eagerly seeking to achieve its goal of "Korea-Manchuria Unity" in the current stage. The significance of Japan's diplomacy in the current stage is simply this.</p>
<p>Japan's annexation of the Northeast has become an established fact. However, swallowing this bomb is enough to provoke anxiety in the Soviet Union, the United States, and the world. Therefore, how Japan can ensure the safety of its occupation of the Northeast is the focus of current government and public deliberation. The breaking of historical records in next year's total budget, the active expansion of the navy, army, and air force, despite the dire financial straits, economic panic, trade decline, and the danger of the rural areas, can all be temporarily put aside. As a result, in Japan's inland rural areas, there are starving people who mainly eat grass roots and tree bark, while the military expenditure</p>
<p>budget exceeds half of the total budget. The contrast between these contradictory phenomena shows that Japan is actively preparing and seems to be making a desperate gamble. However, thinking about the future, Japan is also very worried. The talk of preparing for war may also be just a show of strength. If Japan can achieve good results without having to make major sacrifices, why wouldn't it be happy to do so? Therefore, Japan's response to the outside world still relies on diplomacy.</p>
<p>The current stage of Japanese diplomacy can be said to begin with the publication of the League of Nations' investigation team's report. Yasuya Uchida's response to the investigation team's visit to Tokyo fully revealed Japan's intuition, and after the report was published, the Saitō cabinet even showed blatant opposition. Before ten days had passed, Japan's diplomatic policy underwent a dramatic change, from passively withdrawing from the League of Nations to actively resisting it. The famous "Manchuria-Mongolia expert" Yōsuke Matsuoka has been ordered to go to Geneva, and the so-called "Uchida diplomacy lineup" is also being actively reorganized. The changes in the ambassadors to Russia, Germany, and Italy are the prelude to the reorganization of the diplomatic lineup. It seems that Japan is making a total mobilization in its external affairs.</p>
<p>What is the target of Japanese diplomacy? It is to eliminate all obstacles to Japan's continental policy. Therefore, the central issue of Japanese diplomacy is how to eliminate these obstacles. The report of the League of Nations' investigation team, although not very favorable to our country, is not necessarily very favorable to Japan. Although the United States is currently keeping silent due to the election, it also wants to wait for the League of Nations' attitude so that it can implement a policy of uniting Britain and France to restrain Japan. Therefore, the League of Nations and the United States are undoubtedly the thorns in Japan's side. Moreover, before the union of the United States and France, there was a period of propaganda. Japan originally wanted to use France to restrain the League of Nations. Now that France has hesitations, Japan will be in an even more isolated position. In order to break through this difficult situation of isolation, Japan has no choice but to open up a new path in diplomacy.</p>
<p>What is the new path of Japanese diplomacy? It is to quickly seek progress in Japanese-Russian relations. The decision of this diplomatic strategy, as the recent Japanese "Labor News" said, is a kind of "fraudulent diplomacy." The result can achieve two goals with one move. On the one hand, it uses the atmosphere of alliance with Russia to ease the League of Nations' attitude toward Japan. On the other hand, it uses the closeness of Japanese-Russian relations to isolate the approach of Russia and the United States, and continue to maintain the situation of "Russia unwilling to fight and the United States not daring to fight." Thus, Japan's position in the Northeast can be gradually consolidated. Judging from recent news, the actions of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs seem to have moved forward along this new path. The brewing of a non-aggression treaty between Japan, Russia, and the puppet state hopes that Russia will recognize the puppet state's demands. Matsuoka's propaganda about passing through Siberia to Europe and negotiating in Russia by the way can prove the direction of Japan's diplomacy in the current stage. Even the changes in the ambassadors stationed in Russia, Germany, and Italy, from our oversensitive perspective, are nothing more than wanting to use Germany and Italy, who are fighting for hegemony in Europe, to contain Britain and France. At a time when the various countries are very silent about diplomacy in the Far East, Japanese diplomacy is turning sharply and is very active. Thus, it can be known that the new path of Japanese diplomacy has been determined.</p>
<p>How will the future be? Facts will prove it. We are merely speculating. But what we can determine now is that our country will inevitably be a victim of complex international relations in any aspect we observe. And in the midst of strategic maneuvering, the one who reaps the benefits of the fisherman may not be Japan, but the white bear near the Arctic Ocean: Soviet Russia. The Soviet Union uses the confrontation between Japan and the United States to establish a pivotal position. It can wait for the price to be offered by both Japan and the United States. Today, it can be pro-Japan, and tomorrow it can unite with the United States. It only needs to promote the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan, and it can disregard all means. Its diplomatic skills are unmatched by any country. Please wait and see the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan to observe the color of Soviet Russia.</p>

<h3>The Northern Sichuan Allied Forces Attack Jianyang</h3>
<p>Yang Sen is Appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the Front Lines</p>
<p>Liu Xiang Will Advance to Hechuan or Suining</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Northern Sichuan Allied Forces publicly appointed Yang Sen as the Commander-in-Chief of the Front Lines. After capturing Suining, they detoured through Anyue and Lezhi, and directly attacked Jianyang. Liu Xiang decided to use armed force to stop the Sichuan war. The Twenty-First Army successively set off in two directions, northeast. Liu himself is also preparing to advance to Hechuan or Suining. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Ninety-four Sichuan military generals strongly advocate convening a Suining conference to implement the outline for governing Sichuan, reducing salaries and troops. However, Liu Wenhui opposes it most strongly. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain agency here received a telegram from Chongqing stating that after Suining, Tongnan, Tongliang, and Jiangjin were successively occupied by the Twenty-First Army, the Twenty-Fourth Army in the Yongchuan area could not reluctantly defend. The situation is obviously shaken. The war on this route may shift from Rongchang to Longchang. Also, a telegram from Chengdu stated that Liu Wenhui has indeed left Chengdu. Tian Songyao and Liu Cunhou's armies jointly maintain local security. One theory is that Liu sneaked to Luyi, and another theory is that he went to the front lines to supervise the army. The latter theory is more credible because if Liu wins from the front lines, Chengdu will have no problems. If he loses, he can still transfer to Xikang from Chengdu. Although the various armies are dissatisfied with Liu this time, none of them intend to harm his life. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a Chengdu telegram released by the Twenty-Fourth Army, Fierce battles are still taking place as of the 26th in Dishuiyan Zhenwuchang on the south bank of Jiangjin, and Tai'an Chang and Shimao Chang, which belong to Yongchuan. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Xichui Coordination Association telegraphed Liu Wenhui on the 28th, saying that according to telegrams from various mass organizations in Xikang, foreigners are colluding with Tibetan soldiers, taking advantage of the outbreak of the Sichuan war, and are rushing to seize Xikang, intending to seize the gateway to our western frontier as a base for penetrating the interior. You are entrusted with important responsibilities by the central government, and you are in charge of the important political affairs of Sichuan and Xikang. Defending the border is your unshirkable responsibility. If the Sichuan war cannot be stopped, you should prioritize national defense and never withdraw the garrison troops to engage in civil war. This matter concerns the security of the country and does not allow for personal considerations. Our association has repeatedly been urged by the masses in the western frontier and is deeply concerned about the danger of the national border. We urgently submit this statement and hope you will consider it. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Xikang Mass Representatives Delegation telegraphed Jiang on the 28th from Beijing, saying that the representatives have traveled thousands of miles to Beijing to petition, and their sincerity in seeking internal affiliation is extremely earnest. However, due to the outbreak of the Sichuan war, the central authorities' response to the people's request, although said to be accepted, lacks practical substance. You are in charge of the lifeline of the country and attach importance to western defense. When Tibetan troops take advantage of the crisis, what methods will you adopt to comfort our people in Xikang and secure our borders? We humbly request your telegram for guidance.

<h3>Japanese Military Vehicle on the Qiqihar-Kharonor Line Heavily Attacked</h3>
<p>The Righteous Army Destroyed a Japanese Military Vehicle at Wujiadian Station</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Dropped Heavy Bombs on Hailar</p>
<p>The Righteous Army Attacked Qiliezhezi and Nihezi</p>
<p>Qiqihar At 10:00 a.m. today, Train No. 801, departing from Qiqihar, was suddenly attacked by 300 members of the Righteous Army at Wujiadian Station, from a distance of 50 meters. They attacked the passenger car carrying 23 members of the 5th Company of the Matsumoto ○○ team, including Sergeant Major Yokosawa. They jumped into the car, intending to massacre the non-commissioned officers and soldiers. Both sides engaged in a large-scale fight with grenades and other weapons. The Righteous Army failed to achieve their goal.

<p>Qiqihar The train carrying Sergeant Major Yokosawa and 23 others, which was attacked by the Righteous Army at Wujiadian Station yesterday at 10:00 a.m., returned to Qiqihar at 11:00 a.m. The Righteous Army only targeted the Japanese soldiers, so the other passenger cars suffered minor damage. However, the passenger car carrying Sergeant Major Yokosawa and others was the focus of the bullets. The car body was riddled with holes, and all the windows were destroyed. At the entrance, one member of the Righteous Army was lying on the floor, still holding a gun. The inside of the car was stained with blood, and the scene was extremely tragic.

<h3>Japanese Planes Plan to Bomb Towns in Northern Manchuria</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen telegraphed from Beiping yesterday, stating that the Japanese Matsumoto Division sent several bomber planes on the 26th to drop heavy bombs on Hailar and distribute leaflets signed by the Matsumoto Division Commander. The leaflets declared that they would send heavy siege artillery, large numbers of troops, and numerous bomber planes to completely destroy Zhalantun, Boketu, Hailar, and Manzhouli, etc., until they were reduced to ashes. The above-mentioned places are all non-combat zones, yet they have such brutal propaganda, which is so vicious and insidious that it endangers the lives and property of Chinese and foreign merchants, treating slaughter as child's play. This not only damages the value of the Japanese military but also greatly harms the credibility of international humanitarianism. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Righteous Army Attacks Qiliezhezi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the Righteous Army occupied Yixian City, they attacked Qiliezhezi and Nihezi. Japanese planes bombed the area, and the fighting was fierce. A Japanese armored train rushed to Qiliezhezi Station on the 26th to provide heavy artillery cover for the Japanese military operations. The Righteous Army stubbornly defended the Lama Temple. The Japanese military completely destroyed civilian villages, and the fighting has not stopped. (28th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Circumstances of Han Liru's Death</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In the past two months, the Japanese side has been spreading rumors that Ma Zhanshan was killed. Recently, according to people from Heilongjiang, when Ma launched the uprising, he sent his secretary Han Liru south to make contact. Later, Ma feigned surrender, and Han returned. After Ma revolted again, Han's power increased, and Han was appointed as the Director of Civil Affairs of Heilongjiang Province and Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government. Later, the Japanese military bombed Heihe, and Ma's troops temporarily retreated. Han followed later, with weak forces, and was surrounded by the Japanese military. Han was captured, and the funds of Heilongjiang Province and Ma's daily necessities were all searched by the Japanese military. Han died heroically. Later, the Japanese military, because his face was very similar to Ma Zhanshan, falsely claimed that Ma had been killed and hung Han's head on the city gate of Heihe. A certain gentleman also said that when he came, he had met Ma, who was leading his troops in battle and was in good spirits. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Araki stated at today's cabinet meeting that he had issued instructions to the Kwantung Army to find a way to determine whether Ma Zhanshan had been killed. This is because they have recently intercepted Ma Zhanshan's telegram to Zhang Xueliang requesting financial assistance. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Su Bingwen's and Wang Delin's Troops Adopt Guerrilla Tactics</h3>
<p>(Beiping) People from Heilongjiang Province said that Ma Zhanshan's troops now have more than 40,000 people, and the weapons are all old-fashioned. The locations of the troops stationed in the attacked cities are not concentrated to prevent Japanese planes from bombing. Currently, Su Bingwen and Wang Delin's troops are in contact, and the tactics adopted are guerrilla warfare. Ma's troops once prepared to attack Boketu, and the troops were also concentrated there. If the general attack order was issued, Boketu could be occupied sooner or later. However, occupying Boketu requires 50,000 bullets, and it is feared that some military supplies cannot be obtained, and Japanese planes will bomb, causing the people to suffer needlessly. Therefore, it was abandoned halfway. Ma and his subordinates are still fighting hard, preparing to sacrifice. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Righteous Army Burns Down the Shenyang Arsenal</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association for the Army received a telegram from the Huang Committee of the Liaoning Headquarters, stating that according to the front-line telegrams, the Japanese bandits' plan for the Righteous Army, regarding northern Manchuria, is to assign Domen to be responsible for suppressing them, and to assign Mori and the garrison division to be responsible for clearing southern Manchuria. They are currently carrying out their plan. A few days ago, they transferred about 3,000 troops stationed in Shenyang and Changchun to northern Manchuria to suppress Su's troops. Therefore, the area between Shenyang and Changchun feels extremely empty these days. Only less than 700 Japanese soldiers remain in Shenyang Station. Our army took the opportunity to burn down the Shenyang Arsenal on the evening of the 26th to disrupt their rear and restrain them. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A fire broke out in the Shenyang Arsenal. It was set by a plainclothes team of the Righteous Army who sneaked into the factory. The Japanese military searched the city for plainclothes teams, and many merchants and civilians were brutally killed. (28th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Military is Trapped in Huanxiling</h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) More than 5,000 Japanese soldiers planned to attack Tonghua from Huanxiling, but Tang Juwu and Li Lingran had a pre-planned plan. Li's troops, Li Qingtian and Guan Xiangyang, etc., opened to Longgang with 12,000 people to attack its back. Tang's troops ambushed in Shibangou, Badaojiang, etc., and also had more than 10,000 people to counterattack the front. The Japanese army could not support it and retreated towards Xiaoqinggou Shuangchaohe. They were hit by landmines and suffered many casualties. Tang Juwu is still directing in Dairen. The loss of Tonghua is actually a rumor fabricated by the Japanese. (28th Hualian News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Between Two Armies South of Qianjinzai</h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) On the 25th, more than 200 Japanese cavalry, one regiment of infantry, and five aircraft headed to the south of Qianjinzai to attack the Liaodong Righteous Army. Commander-in-chief Huang Yuzhou personally led the guard to contact them. Huang's troops relied on the mountains to defend, and although it lasted for two nights, all the Japanese military aircraft and artillery were ineffective. In the end, Huang's troops defeated the Japanese army, and the number of casualties is unknown. Huang's troops obtained seven horses and forty-eight rifles. (28th Hualian News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Arrives in Hunan</h3>
<p>(Changsha) Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling passed through Yuezhou on the 28th at noon, did not visit Dianshan, and are scheduled to arrive in the province at sunset. The party, government, and military circles have scheduled a public banquet on the 29th, a visit to Mount Heng on the 30th, and a return to Hankou on the 31st. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang believes that the communist bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have mostly disintegrated and will soon be eliminated. The suppression of bandits in the three provinces will soon be concluded. However, the flames of banditry in the three provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong have not been completely extinguished and are attempting to make a final struggle. He Yingqin is currently unable to return to Jiangxi. Chiang plans a one-stop solution, and will go to Hunan on the 27th and return to Hankou on the 31st, and after attending the four-province highway meeting, he will decide to go to Jiangxi in early next month to personally supervise the suppression and work together with the Fujian and Guangdong armies to recover the lost areas. From now on, the unfinished bandit suppression matters in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui will be presided over by Liu Zhi, the Chairman of Henan Province. (28th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Han Fuqu Agrees to First Withdraw Troops of Liu</h3>
<p>Central Government Has Agreed to Postpone Withdrawal Deadline by Several Days</p>
<p>Liu to Lead Troops Out of Yexian City After Han's Troops Withdraw</p>
<p>Two to Three Hundred of Liu's Troops Rush Out of Laiyang City</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Han Fuqu previously telegraphed Jiang Bocheng, requesting that he forward a request to the Central Government to allow an extension of the troop withdrawal period. It is heard that He Yingqin replied to Jiang Bocheng by telegram on the 28th, stating that as long as Han can abide by the Hao (19th) telegram for handling matters, a slight delay of a few days would not be unacceptable, etc. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The dispute between Lu, Han, and Liu has gradually eased. Currently, the crux lies only in the issue of the timing of the withdrawal. Liu Zhennian's representative, Yang Lichuan, stated that Liu's troops would be transferred or reduced in accordance with the Central Government's orders, but Han must first withdraw the troops surrounding Yexian and Laiyang to facilitate troop movements. Han also stated that if Liu's troops were transferred, he would first withdraw the troops surrounding the cities, which would be perfectly acceptable. The Lu matter can be fully resolved within days. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian telegraphed at You time on the 27th, stating: 1. Two of Han's planes came to bomb Yexian City again today and distributed leaflets, and the artillery bombardment of Yexian City continued as before. 2. Han's Gu Shi Huang regiment is still stationed in Yantai, and in the areas of Muping, Fushan, and other parts of eastern Shandong, Han's troops have not withdrawn. 3. Han's cavalry brigade stationed in Mouping has dispatched its battalion and an infantry battalion stationed in Fushan, advancing towards Qixia City, and have now reached Beikouzi, threatening to take Qixia City within days. 4. Han's troops confronting my division's troops stationed in Laiyang are now gradually advancing, already more than ten li from the city. From the above, it is clear that Han's troops seem to be planning to attack Qixia and Laiyang cities, with absolutely no intention of withdrawing troops. He hopes this will be reported to the Central Government. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Representative of Chiang, Zhang Fang, and representative of Liu Zhi, Liu Yaoyang, arrived in Jinan by special train at 11:40 this morning. Han and key military and political figures made a grand welcome at the station, and then went to the Jiaoji Hotel to rest. Zhang told reporters that his arrival was not for any special mission. Due to the issue of Liu's troops in Jiaodong, the President is very concerned. Knowing that he and Han are old friends of many years, he was sent to take a look and meet some old acquaintances. The President hopes that the Lu issue will be resolved peacefully and return to calm without incident. The President believes that Han is responsible for the security of Shandong, and respects Han's opinion on the Jiaodong issue, taking Han's opinion as his own, without any fixed prejudice, hoping to consider both the prestige of the Central Government and local security. The first step is to cease military actions so as not to affect international diplomacy due to the Liu issue. As for Liu leaving Shandong, this is not a problem, and should not be overemphasized. How to handle it will be decided after consulting with Han and seeking instructions from the President. Han's opinion has not yet been discussed. Also, Han said that the director of the Yiban Branch, Tang Xiang, telegraphed yesterday, informing him that the Central Government has decided to transfer Liu's troops out of Shandong. Minister He also sent a telegram stating the reasons and process for his Hao telegram, delineating Yantai and Longkou as Liu's defense zone, which is a preparation for transferring Liu away from there, with good intentions. Director Zhang telegraphed, still advocating that Yantai and Longkou be temporarily garrisoned by a third party to facilitate Liu's transfer. He fully agrees with this method, because as long as Liu leaves Jiaodong, the suffering of the people will be relieved, and he will be willing to do anything. For example, when two people are fighting, the mediator must order both parties to step back before persuading one to leave. Even if I am ordered to leave, it is fine. Now that the Central Government has decided to order Liu's troops to leave Shandong, the Three Route Army can withdraw first in order to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Zhang Fang's arrival is to discuss the method, but Yantai and Longkou are places where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the relationship is important. It is best for Shen's naval forces to temporarily garrison there, so that they are familiar with the situation and no other accidents will occur. One regiment of the provincial army Ning Brigade is currently stationed in Yantai. There are Liu's defeated soldiers and bandits looting in Qixia. The cavalry brigade of Li Xuande can now go to Qixia to suppress them. He resigned because of a lack of political knowledge. When he took office, he promised to serve for one year, and now it has been more than two years, so he urgently wants to get out. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is heard that Liu Zhennian secretly telegraphed the government, stating that in order to avoid making things difficult for the Central Government, he is willing to accept Vice Chairman Zhang Xueliang's proposal to voluntarily transfer to another province, awaiting the designation of a garrison location. Once the third-party takeover troops arrive, he will lead all troops out of the territory. As for the troops taking over in eastern Shandong, the military authorities, being impartial, are advocating that the two divisions of Shang Zhen and Pang Bingxun from the north be transferred there. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng went to Jinan today. At the station, he told reporters that Han requested that he telegraph the Central Government to request an extension of the withdrawal deadline because the withdrawal deadline was near. He truthfully telegraphed Jiang and He, but there has been no reply. This trip to Jinan is in response to Han's invitation and to follow Chiang's orders to find a solution to the Lu issue. It will only be possible to negotiate after meeting with Han and Zhang Fang and Xiong Bin in Jinan. He met with Zhang Xueliang twice last night and this morning. Zhang's opinion on the Lu issue is completely in line with Chiang's, and he only hopes for an early resolution. He will return to Peiping after the Lu issue is resolved. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is heard that the Central Government has submitted Han Fuqu's request for the Northeast Navy to take over after the withdrawal of troops from Yantai and Longkou, and the stipulation of a deadline for Liu's troops to leave Shandong, etc., to the Ministry of Military Affairs for discussion. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin telegraphed Jiang Bocheng last night, still asking Han to withdraw his troops as soon as possible, in order to show the authority of the entire Central Government, etc. The second step of the method is not a problem. After Chiang arrives in Jinan and discusses the second step of the method in detail, Han's troops can withdraw to the west of the Wei River. Chiang Kai-shek sent Zhang Fang to Jinan this time because Han and the Shandong Provincial Committee telegraphed requesting him to go. Chiang had instructed Zhang to persuade Han to consider the overall situation and do his best to eliminate local disputes. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Jiaodong matter, Han Fuqu has indicated that he will withdraw his troops, but he needs guarantees for transferring Liu out of Shandong. This matter has been guaranteed by the mediators. After Han withdraws his troops, Liu will lead his troops out of Yexian City, first concentrating his troops in Longkou, and then transferring them by sea to Anhui to suppress bandits. Ma Hongkui's troops will be transferred to Jiaodong to fill the defense, but this has not yet been determined because Ma's consent is required. It is heard that the method for the withdrawal of Han and Liu's troops is that Yantai and Longkou, etc., will be garrisoned by the Naval Marines after Han's troops withdraw to Changyi. Then the siege of Yexian will be lifted, and Sun Tongxuan's troops will be withdrawn to the Xinhe area. All of Yantai and Longkou will be taken over by the Naval Marines. Then Liu Zhennian will withdraw from Yexian along the Yantai-Wei County highway. Detailed methods will be discussed after Chiang Bocheng, Zhang Fang, and Xiong Bin arrive in Jinan. Jiang Bocheng is scheduled to go to Jinan tonight, and the Lu issue will not be difficult to resolve. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Yesterday, two to three hundred of Liu's troops in Laiyang City suddenly rushed out and fled to the southeast. Jin Dianbang, the 173rd regiment commander of the 87th Brigade stationed in Gaomi, was ordered yesterday to lead 500 soldiers and 40 horses to Lancun by car, and then to intercept them. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu also said that Jiang Zongcan Yi Bocheng was the first to mediate this matter. He has ordered Liu Xizhong to go to Peiping and invite him to come to Jinan again so that everyone can discuss together. Jiang telegraphed the President for instructions, and a telegram came this afternoon, stating that he will arrive in Jinan early on the 29th. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Liu Yaoyang said that the Jiaodong matter was originally trivial, but rumors spread everywhere. Chairman Liu and Han have shared hardships for a long time, so he was sent to see Han, hoping that the Jiaodong matter would be reduced to nothing and resolved as soon as possible, and to ask Han to dismiss his resignation. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Liu Yaoyang said that there are only four to five thousand bandits of the Communist Party of Henan left in Deng County. A week ago, the 15th Route Army, the 11th Route Army, the 48th Division, and the 1st Division fought fiercely with He Long in Zaoyang, western Hubei. Six to seven thousand bandits died, and the main force has been broken. The bandit area in western Anhui and eastern Hubei will be placed under the supervision of the post-war rehabilitation of bandits, which is currently temporarily handled by the Director of the Suiqing Office. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han hosted a banquet for Zhang Fang, Liu Yaoyang, Feng Baideng, etc., at Zhenzhuquan in the provincial government at 6:00 p.m. tonight, with various people in attendance. Han said that after discussing with Zhang, the President intended to first order the provincial army to withdraw in order to allow Liu to leave Shandong. He fully obeyed this. Liu will leave by sea, but the date has not been determined. He and Zhang have both telegraphed the President for instructions, and this matter can be resolved. (28th)</p>
<p>(Shahe telegraph) Liu's soldiers who escaped from Yexian said that Liu claimed to be ill and did not see anyone, and it was rumored that one leg had been severely injured by bombing. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The key to resolving the Lu issue still depends on whether Han can withdraw his troops. It is heard that Chairman Chiang telegraphed a certain military authority, saying that the Central Government has always strived for a peaceful resolution of the Lu issue. Whether Liu Zhennian's troops in Jiaodong will be transferred out of Shandong, or whether other troops will be transferred to garrison there, the Central Government has the right to weigh the situation. However, the prerequisite is still to obey the Central Government's order to withdraw to the original defense, before a fair handling can be given. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Talks About Wang Going to Geneva</h3>
<p>Strategies to Assist Yan, Gu, etc. in All Matters</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen flew to Shanghai by plane on the morning of the 28th, accompanied by Liu Ruiheng and Zhang Xueliang's advisor Donald, as well as his secretary Huang Chun. Before leaving, he told people that when the Central Committee members in Shanghai were seeing Wang off, they were moved by the importance of this League of Nations conference. The representatives exchanged telegrams with the Central Government back and forth, with some twists and turns.

<h3>Japan Annexes Yanbian</h3>
<p>Hunchun, Yanji, and Longjing Villages Incorporated into Korean Territory</p>
<p>(Beiping) The counties of Jilin, Hunchun, Yanji, and Longjing Village are located on the border between China and Korea, in the western part of Jilin Province. Currently, there are over 400,000 Korean residents in Yanbian, while the Chinese population is less than 3/10 of the Korean population. In March of this year, the puppet state borrowed a large sum of 20 million yuan from Japan, with the condition of ceding Yanbian. As a result, the Japanese began to incorporate Hunchun, Yanji, and Longjing Village into Korean territory, under the administrative control of the Governor-General of Korea. In May, they sent Tanaka, the chief of the foreign affairs section, to reside in Yanji to plan the establishment of the so-called New Island, a specially designated administrative area. All investigations, organizations, and police deployments are now in place. Tanaka returned to Korea on the 11th of this month to report on his mission. The Japanese are now planning to relocate a large number of Korean people to central Jilin, adopting the so-called group immigration policy. The Governor-General of Korea has decided to appoint a Korean as the administrative head of the Yanbian Special District. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper in Harbin Publishes Anti-Russian Remarks</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese newspaper Harbin Times today published strange remarks criticizing Soviet Russia. It stated that before Su Bingwen's rebellion, overseas Chinese from Soviet Russia opened several restaurants in Manchuria, catering to soldiers. The shop assistants were students from the Moscow Institute of Asian Peoples and students from a certain school related to the Chinese Club of Vladivostok. After Su Bingwen's rebellion, these overseas Chinese and several Russians became machine gunners in the rebel army. The newly established military affairs division in the Soviet army is headed by Europeans of unclear nationality, who control all decisions made by the headquarters. The headquarters has also established a political division, which is currently posting slogans in its occupied areas, such as "Overthrow the capitalists," "Welcome the new era of workers," "Restore diplomatic relations with Russia," "Down with imperialist aggressors," and "Welcome the unity of workers and soldiers," "World workers unite," etc. If the Russian government, as stated by officials, does not participate in the above-mentioned activities, it should stop these overseas Chinese to dispel misunderstandings. If it is said that the Russian representatives are unaware of the activities of these people in "Manchukuo," it is impossible not to be suspicious. (Reuters dispatch of the 27th)</p>

<h3>Steel Plant Site Not Yet Surveyed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to German sources, German Hope Company technician Kang Daofu and others inspected the site of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant near Fanchang. There are several uneconomical and inconvenient aspects, and they believe it has little value. The Ministry of Industry accompanied them to inspect the Pukou area again today, but the coal source is too far away and the land is too low and humid, so it could not be selected. The signing of the German loan will be delayed. The Ministry of Industry is currently negotiating with the Ministry of Finance to issue 40 million yuan in national treasury bonds, with the guarantee of increasing the import tax on foreign coal by 1.5 yuan for principal and interest. After this news spread, coal merchants in various places paid close attention. They all believe that increasing the import tax on foreign goods is beneficial in terms of protecting domestic products, but there is very little domestic production of bituminous coal, so it seems inappropriate to increase the tax to increase the burden on the people, and they will submit a statement of the advantages and disadvantages for the Ministry of Industry to consider.

<p>Using Sticks and Stones as Weapons, Conflicts with Police Arise</p>
<p>Order Remains Good at Hyde Park Rally</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, London, 27th The representatives of 2,500 unemployed petitioners from all over the United Kingdom arrived in London today. A large-scale riot suddenly broke out near Hyde Park. However, these petitioners maintained order throughout and did not participate in the riot. The rioters were other unemployed people in London. According to police estimates, when the rioters clashed with the police, no less than 100,000 people gathered around Hyde Park, causing many bystanders to be trampled and injured. According to a post-riot investigation, more than 60 people were injured, including two with extremely serious injuries, and the property damage was enormous. It is reported that this afternoon, the unemployed petitioners held a meeting in Hyde Park to protest the newly promulgated means test (also known as the asset test) for receiving unemployment relief, and remained extremely orderly throughout. After the meeting, they marched out in formation and dispersed peacefully. Unexpectedly, at about 3 PM, while the petitioners were holding a meeting, another 5,000 people gathered in Hyde Park. The authorities dispatched more police to maintain order. Initially, there were no disturbances. However, at 3:35 PM, more than 1,000 young people and some women suddenly began to smash windows and throw stones at cars parked in front of the Marble Arch. Mounted police and foot police then used batons to suppress them. Although the rioters retreated, they continued to clash with the police in the four major thoroughfares near the park. Some people in the crowd threw stones at the police, and several people were arrested. The crowd then retreated to the side streets, and the disturbances seemed to subside slightly. However, at 4:30 PM, a major clash broke out again, with more than 5,000 people fighting fiercely with more than 200 police officers. The rioters uprooted more than 50 yards of roadside fences and used them as weapons, along with stones and wooden sticks, repeatedly charging the police. Shouts and the sound of breaking glass echoed at the same time. The police remained calm and eventually dispersed the rioters. At that time, pedestrians who heard the noise and came to watch were packed like walls, and often fell into the middle of the battle, resulting in many being knocked to the ground and trampled. It is also reported that more than 10,000 unemployed people in Glasgow also formed a team to protest the means test at the City Hall. Police were present to maintain order along the way, and no disturbances occurred.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 28th Sir Gilmour described the disturbances of yesterday in the Lower House today, saying that the police had found short clubs wrapped in iron in the freight cars of the Lancashire Detachment, which were later confiscated. These short clubs were distributed by a truck during the demonstration. The disturbances were not caused by genuine unemployed people, but by troublemakers. A total of 19 police officers were injured, including two with serious injuries, one of whom was the patrol chief. A total of 58 demonstrators were injured, and 8 were arrested.</p>
<p>Hoover's Military Expansion Declaration Appears to Be Aimed at Japan</p>
<p>▲ Havas, London, 27th People in British and Japanese circles here believe that Tokyo may not notify the major powers of its new naval disarmament proposal until before the Geneva conference. Today, US President Hoover declared that if negotiations on naval disarmament are unsuccessful, the United States will build all the tonnage allowed by the London Treaty. This statement greatly shocked the London authorities, as such a warning from the White House came at the end of negotiations by US representative Davis, which was unexpected by anyone. London political circles believe that Hoover's declaration is a warning to Tokyo, not just to London. It seems that Tokyo's new proposal sent by sea cable indicates that Japan cannot accept the basis of Hoover's proposal. However, US Secretary of State Stimson said in a speech in Gunzburg yesterday that when there is a danger of war, the international community has a responsibility to consult with each other, which is completely consistent with the views expressed by US representative Davis here.</p>
<p>US Naval Commander in Honolulu Gives Speech</p>
<p>Stating No Desire to Challenge Japan, Preferring to Show Weakness</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Honolulu, 27th Rear Admiral Stirling, commander of the naval base in Honolulu, gave a Navy Day speech to the people of Honolulu today, one section of which was addressed to Japanese residents. He said, "Although our country's diplomatic spokespersons and the League of Nations have not yet been able to reconcile with Japan's Far East policy and are willing to accept it, I can assure our people that there is absolutely no desire to challenge Japan, nor is there any intention to succumb to Japan. However, Japanese news views our country's protests against some of Japan's policies as vaguely threatening war, and wants to make the Japanese people believe that the concentration of the US fleet in the Pacific is not entirely for the purpose of saving money, as we all know, but as a threat to the Japanese Empire. I hope that the Japanese residents of Honolulu will convey this message to the people of your country to dispel this unnecessary suspicion." He then detailed that the concentration of the US fleet in the Pacific was purely for economic reasons and had no other purpose. Speakers said that the purpose of Mr. Stirling's remarks was to dispel the suspicion of the Japanese, and that he must have obtained the consent of the Washington government beforehand. Also, although Mr. Stirling's speech did not mention the case of the army soldiers discovered yesterday privately stealing defense secret documents, those who heard his speech also believed that it was not unrelated to the claim in the case that the two soldiers hoped to sell the documents to Japan, because the secret documents concerned Honolulu's secret defense. Therefore, Mr. Stirling made this speech to dispel the suspicion of the islanders caused by the case.</p>
<p>Matsudaira Meets with Davis to Discuss Disarmament</p>
<p>New Proposal Remains a Mystery</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 27th It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Matsudaira, did not hand over Japan's new proposal on naval disarmament when he met with Davis, the US representative attending the Disarmament Conference and the World Economic Conference, this morning. When this conversation was scheduled, the Japanese proposal had not yet been received. Today, both sides spoke about the general nature of disarmament. It is expected that they must have mentioned the Japanese proposal, but did not discuss it in detail. This afternoon, Davis met with British Prime Minister MacDonald in the Lower House.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 28th Davis, the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, expressed his satisfaction today with the situation of his meetings with British Prime Minister MacDonald and others on British and American naval issues and disarmament issues. Davis said that he believed that this matter would eventually make real progress, but in the current situation, progress could not be too fast. Mr. Davis arrived in London on October 10 and is scheduled to depart for Geneva tomorrow.</p>
<p>Rebutting Japan's Written Opinion on the Lytton Report</p>
<p>Written in English, Divided into Five Chapters, Vigorously Defending the Justification of the Invasion, Especially Emphasizing the Issue of Boycotting Goods</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 28th The Japanese government's written opinion on the Lytton Report was finalized yesterday, approved by the Cabinet today, and submitted by Foreign Minister Uchida to the Emperor for approval. It will be carried to Geneva tonight by Yoshida, who is departing for Tokyo, and submitted to the League of Nations Secretariat. This written opinion is drafted in English and consists of about 100 pages, divided into five chapters: (1) Introduction, (2) The September 18th Incident, (3) The County Case Concerning China, Japan, and Manchuria, (4) Manchukuo, (5) Conclusion. The main points are as follows: (1) The September 18th Incident and the subsequent actions of the Japanese army in Manchuria were nothing more than the exercise of strict self-defense rights. However, the conclusion of the report stated that this action exceeded the scope of self-defense rights and was based on the materials of the Chinese side. Moreover, whether it is an act of self-defense can only be determined by the government of the country concerned. This was clearly advocated by Kellogg. If the tense state between China and Japan before the incident can be clarified, anyone should support the Japanese view. (2) At the beginning of the establishment of a new country, it is common for advanced countries to participate in assistance, even in Europe and the United States. The report stated that the construction of "Manchukuo" was under the guidance of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, which can be said to be a false accusation against Japan. (3) The report excessively underestimated the fact that China cannot be recognized as an organized country. However, this fact is the root cause of the disaster in the Far East. Therefore, the report detailed the uncontrolled state of modern China in order to correct the League of Nations' views. (4) The report was not sufficient in its discussion of the Chinese boycott of goods, and did not adequately address the responsibility of the Chinese government. The boycott was directed and ordered by the Kuomintang, which is one with the Chinese government, and was an act of non-military aggression against Japan. The League of Nations did not address this point, which is not the way to maintain the sanctity of the League of Nations Covenant. (5) The resolution proposal presented in the report cannot be implemented today, as Japan has formally recognized "Manchukuo." The survey team, which judged that the Chinese government had no unifying power, wanted to place "Manchukuo" under the Chinese government, which is self-contradictory. This kind of advice will only lead to future disputes and dangers. The Japanese government firmly believes that the solution to the Manchurian problem can only be achieved through the recognition of "Manchukuo" and the coordination and negotiation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo.</p>
<p>League of Nations Special Committee Decides to Invite the United States and Russia to Participate</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 28th It was learned from the Gekert side today that the time for the League of Nations and the 19-member Special Committee to discuss the Lytton Report will be extended by at least three weeks before the General Assembly is convened. League of Nations officials are currently considering how to enable the United States and Russia to participate in this discussion. Some steps have been taken in this regard. It is reported that General McCoy, the US representative of the investigation team, will attend the discussion, but everyone hopes that both the United States and Russia will have informal representatives attending the meeting, because the Lytton Report clearly stated that without the cooperation of these two countries, the resolution cannot have true effect.</p>
<p>▲ International Telegraph Agency, October 3 Communication Although the Sino-Japanese case has temporarily become silent here, with the election of the Executive Yuan this term, the representatives of Mexico and Czechoslovakia were elected as members. The Sino-Japanese conflict issue is about to gradually become tense again, because both Mexico and Czechoslovakia are among the small and weak countries. During the General Assembly of the League of Nations Executive Yuan in March this year, the small and weak countries united to support the League of Nations Covenant and expressed their opposition to the barbarous acts of the Japanese. Mexico may unite with the small South American countries and join hands with the United States to deal with Japan. Benes is the former Director-General of Czechoslovakia, who has always advocated using the League of Nations Covenant to solve the Sino-Japanese problem, and will continue to implement his proposals in the Executive Yuan in the future.</p>
<p>Changes in Japanese Diplomats</p>
<p>Ota to Russia, Matsushima to Italy</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 28th According to Gekert news, the former Japanese Ambassador to Spain, Ota Kijiro, will replace Hirota as the Ambassador to Russia, and Matsushima Hajime, director of the European Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will replace Yoshida Shigeru as the Ambassador to Italy.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Impersonate British Goods</p>
<p>British Merchants Consider Boycott Methods</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Manchester, 27th The Manchester Chamber of Commerce is now considering how to boycott the behavior of Japanese manufacturers and merchants, because the Japanese imitate British trademarks and British cloth patterns, which greatly damages British cotton cloth trade in India. Lancashire suffers a great loss every year due to this behavior of the Japanese. Today, Rodier, chairman of the Indian Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, claimed that although there is legal protection, the situation is extremely complicated. The famous businessman Rod said that those who understand the situation are unwilling to take legal action in India, because the procedures take a lot of time and there is no guarantee. The Japanese are aware of this and take advantage of it, which is a very serious matter. The Japanese have no scruples about stealing British trademarks and patterns.</p>
<p>Celebrating the Success Anniversary</p>
<p>Newly Built Streets Open Simultaneously</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Rome, 28th Today is the tenth anniversary of the Fascist Party's march on Rome. The whole country is out of work and rejoicing. Black Shirt teams from all over the country gathered in Rome. European War veterans and those disabled for the party formed another team. Today is the first day of the eleventh year of the Fascist era. This kind of record is placed alongside the Western calendar on all official documents and monuments. All public offices in the city hung the tricolor flag and the Fascist Party flag side by side. At night, electric lights shone brightly. In the morning, Black Shirt comrades, led by military music, marched in formation through the streets to the gathering place to listen to Mussolini's speech. The most impressive ceremony today was the official opening ceremony of the newly excavated cultural relics area. This is a symbol of the glory of Rome, so the Fascist Party people pay special attention to it.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Rome, 28th A newly built street, "Via dei Colli", one of the most beautiful streets in Europe, was opened to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the success of Fascism. Prime Minister Mussolini and General Balbo led 13,000 disabled soldiers in a parade through the street. Rome's first underground railway, 80 miles long, leading to Viterbo, was also opened today. The road was completely built within a year. The Via dei Colli street leads to the prosperous area of the old Roman Empire. In the past five months, the authorities have excavated the area and discovered many cultural relics.</p>
<p>Gandhi's Conditions for Release</p>
<p>Must Declare Withdrawal from the Resistance Movement</p>
<p>▲ Havas, London, 27th The Muslim leader Shaukat Ali requested the Governor-General of India to release Gandhi. The Governor-General recently replied that Gandhi could not be released unless he declared complete withdrawal from the non-violent resistance movement.</p>
<p>Bolivian Troops Discouraged</p>
<p>One Hundred Remains Found in the Forest</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paraguayan Capital, 27th Local morale is depressed, and people are fleeing. In the Managa war zone, Paraguayan troops captured many people.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Asunción, 28th The Paraguayan Ministry of the Army issued a communiqué stating that Paraguayan troops had found about 100 corpses of Bolivian soldiers who had died of thirst in the Chaco forest. Yesterday, three Bolivian soldiers struggled to reach the Paraguayan army's outpost and said that an infantry battalion of four officers and 170 soldiers were lost in the forest. Upon hearing this news, the Paraguayan army rushed to search and discovered the above-mentioned remains.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 27th The months-long undeclared war between Bolivia and Paraguay is expected to end soon, as both sides have agreed to a ceasefire proposal and are willing to submit the points of contention to neutral representatives for public judgment. However, while Bolivia agrees to a ceasefire, it still maintains its defense line and appoints a German as the commander-in-chief of the battlefield.</p>
<p>Polish President Promulgates Provisional Decree Defining Territorial Waters</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Warsaw, 27th President Moscicki has recently promulgated a provisional legal decree based on the framework set by the 1930 Hague International Law Conference to define the boundaries of Polish territorial waters. This order follows the usual principle of setting the scope of territorial waters at three nautical miles, because the issue of the breadth of territorial waters has not yet been determined in international law. According to this order, Puck Bay belongs to Polish inland waters, with a straight line from Hel Peninsula to Puthodski Peninsula. Everything within this line is territorial waters. However, although the Free City of Danzig is within the Polish customs boundary, according to the Convention for the Suppression of Smuggling of Alcohol concluded in Helsinki in 1925, the sea area within six nautical miles of the city is still Danzig's territorial waters. The above order will take effect within 15 days from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>German President Still Trusts von Papen</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Berlin, 27th President Hindenburg ordered the publication of an official report stating that he still fully trusts Prime Minister von Papen. The reason for this move is that since the Supreme Court of Leipzig issued its verdict, many newspapers have spread rumors that the position of the von Papen cabinet has been shaken. This kind of news has been circulating in political circles, so Hindenburg believes that it is necessary to formally deny it.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Berlin, 27th President Hindenburg is scheduled to meet with former Prussian Prime Minister Braun and federal-appointed Administrative Commissioner von Papen on Saturday at the same time. The President's intention seems to be to inquire about the opinions of both parties clearly, as there are two governments in Prussia after the Supreme Court's verdict. Prime Minister Braun intends to cooperate with Administrative Commissioner von Papen, but von Papen is unwilling. Hindenburg seems to want to mediate between the two parties so that Braun's plan can be realized. The Federal Cabinet is scheduled to meet tomorrow to consider the situation created by the Supreme Court's verdict. Some people say that von Papen intends to transform the Prussian administrative organization and abolish the government recognized as legal by the Supreme Court. However, this issue may not be discussed at the cabinet meeting tomorrow.</p>

<p>Important News: Japan's Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>During its period of invading other countries, Japan also loudly proclaimed its national crisis. What is its national crisis? This is the economic panic that everyone knows. However, in order to alleviate the psychological feeling of "panic" a little, it only calls it "recession." Although this huge and long-term "recession" has recently resulted in a sharp drop in foreign exchange and a sharp increase in raw silk exports due to the implementation of the policy of currency inflation (the price of silk fell to 450 yuan in the summer of this year and has now risen to about 900 yuan), it should be that the general market should be lively, right? However, in reality, the people's livelihood is still declining, and the number of unemployed has not decreased, but has increased, because many people have returned to the countryside. However, the difficulties in the countryside have not been alleviated by relief. Almost everything has to return to the state of bartering for goods, so the scenes of injustice are more serious than before, and the deterioration of thought is becoming more and more popular.</p>
<p>Now let's not talk about the suffering of the Japanese people, but only talk about the financial situation of the government, the most important part of the overall hub of its invasion. The budget for this year has expanded, tax revenue has decreased, and the expenses for invading China have increased. Therefore, the public bonds issued in this year are at least 464 million yuan in Japanese currency. The financial difficulties can be seen from this. The budget for next year is even larger. However, the new requirements, military expenses, relief expenses, and other expenses have reached 1.2 billion yuan in Japanese currency. Adding the regular expenses, the total amount will be more than 2.4 billion yuan. Among them, military expenses account for more than one-half, and the so-called situation relief expenses are no less than 300 million yuan. In this way, although the military scene can be maintained with difficulty, such a huge amount of money, 1.2 billion yuan of new expenses, I don't know where to get it from. The military believes that it is best to increase taxes. They believe that it is not a big deal for the "wealthy class" to pay a little more money, so they advocate creating exchanges and increasing capital interest tax, inheritance tax, income tax, and so on. This method of increasing taxes is certainly not blameworthy from one perspective, and it does not harm the country's vitality. However, Takahashi Korekiyo and the capitalists are still people on the side, and they are ultimately unwilling to excessively increase their own burdens. Even if they are willing to increase taxes, the increased revenue in the national treasury will not exceed 50 or 60 million at most. Adding the increase in postal delivery fees, it will not increase by more than 100 million yuan. The difference is truly more than 108,000. As a result, the budget案 has not been compiled, and it has encountered great difficulties, falling into opposition between the military and finance (or even it can be said that it is opposition between the military and the government). The intention of its financial authorities is that even if the tax rate is increased, the income is limited, so it can be said that the financial resources are exhausted. Therefore, Takahashi's finance borrowed the name of recuperation and temporarily did not dare to touch the military's reverse scale (because the military advocated that their new requirements could not be reduced by one cent). However, the actual financial situation is that if it is really done according to the military's proposal, there is no second way to go except for financial bankruptcy. The issue of issuing public bonds is not easy either. At present, Japan's domestic and foreign debts total more than 6.31 billion yuan, which is not a small number. If another 1 billion yuan of public bonds are issued, the extremely poor farmers and the exhausted industrial and commercial operators, where can they afford it?</p>
<p>The so-called situation relief expenses (rural civil engineering projects, etc.) are to strip the money from the people, and after the government transfers it to the hand (discounting the handling fees), it is returned to the people in piecemeal. Such a relief method only becomes poorer and poorer the more it is relieved. As for enriching military equipment and invasion expenses, it is a purely consumption expense. However, ordinary people know this clearly, but they dare not discuss its right and wrong, and resentment gradually increases. Those who hang the samurai spirit brand and regard themselves as loyal to the emperor and patriotic now feel that their stomachs are hungry, which is very important. It seems very unreasonable to go to show off one's power in the ice and snow and use hot</p>

<p>blood to irrigate a militarist "dead flower," so most people, although they dare not speak out, have already revealed their expressions of poverty, suffering, and anger. As a result, the military cannot help but express that its new budget requirements can be slightly reduced (October 23, Tokyo).</p>
<p>Chiang Inspects Hunan</p>
<p>▲ He Chengjun Goes to Fancheng to Supervise the Army and Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>▲ Xu Yuanquan Returns to Hankou and Departs for Xinti Immediately</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Military Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stationed in Hankou for four months, and all the main forces of the Red Bandits have been defeated. The remaining bandits can be completely eliminated. What is now being worked on is clearing the countryside, post-disaster relief, restoring the countryside, and organizing the people, compiling household registration, and other matters, which have also been formulated into regulations and are being implemented separately. Two months ago, Hunan Provincial Government Chairman He Jian repeatedly telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, welcoming him to Hunan for inspection. He responded that military affairs were complicated and he had to preside over them in Hankou, so he could not go. Now that the bandit forces have been suppressed, he is taking the time to go. On the morning of the 27th, Chiang Kai-shek summoned Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun and personally instructed him on bandit suppression strategies, and inquired from the Tenth Army Commander Xu Yuanquan about the situation of clearing the countryside in the Hubei Central District. He then instructed the Chu You and Weisheng warships stationed in Hankou to start their fires and stand by. At 1:00 PM, Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, Soong Meiling, boarded the Chu You warship and set off for Hunan. Chief Guard Wang Shih-he, Secretary Li Wan, Deng Wenyi, and He Jian's representative in Hankou, Hu Xiehuai, and others accompanied him. The Weisheng warship followed as escort. It is estimated that they will arrive in Changsha on the 28th. Chiang Kai-shek's trip is to inspect the military, political, and construction situation in Hunan Province, or to take the opportunity to visit scenic spots. When passing Yuezhou, he will go ashore for inspection. It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek will not stay in Hunan for long and will return to Hankou at the end of the month to attend the Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi four-province highway conference to be held on the first of next month. It is also reported that he will soon go to Sichuan Province to facilitate the management of the Sichuan situation. However, whether this is the case will depend on future circumstances, and it is not yet possible to predict at this time. Before leaving Hankou, Chiang Kai-shek ordered that the remaining bandits of Xu Xiangqian had fled to northern Hubei and southern Henan and should be eliminated in time to avoid future troubles. Therefore, on the 26th, he telegraphed He Chengjun to return to Hankou, instructed him on the strategy, and ordered him to go to Fancheng to supervise the army and advance to suppress the bandits. All the troops in northern Hubei were placed under He Chengjun's command to unify power. After receiving the order, He Chengjun, along with Chief of Staff Guan Linshu and Staff Officer Chen Yucang, departed for Fancheng on the Cessna aircraft prepared by Chiang Kai-shek at noon on the 27th. Yang Yadong, a senior staff member of the Yuekou Administrative Office, Secretary Li Peng, Adjutant Wen Zhenpan, and others returned to Hankou from Yuekou on the Hanchuan Jinghua two cargo ships on the same day and planned to take the Pinghan express train to Huayuan on the 28th, then transfer to the Xianghua car to Fancheng to organize the Administrative Office. During He Chengjun's departure period, the affairs of the Pacification Office were handled on his behalf by Chief of Staff Yang Kui, with the assistance of Office Director Chen Guangzu and Chief Counselor Zhu Chuanjing. Civil Affairs Director Zhu Huaibing originally planned to travel with He Chengjun to inspect the political affairs of northern Hubei, but was unable to do so temporarily due to an incident and changed his plans to travel by plane on the 28th. The Administrative Office may be located in Xiangyang. Also, Tenth Army Commander Xu Yuanquan returned to Hankou from Yuekou on the 26th to pay his respects to Chiang Kai-shek and will go to Xindi soon. According to Xu Yuanquan, after the Honghu area was cleared, there were no traces of Red Bandits in the central Hubei area. The north and south banks of the Xianghe River were especially peaceful. The Anti-Communist Volunteer Teams in the counties are now well organized and can defend themselves even without troops stationed there. However, the countryside has been ravaged by bandits for too long and urgently needs to be restored. Director Zhu and the Administrative Supervisor have planned relief efforts with the local gentry. I (Xu referred to himself) came to Hankou from Yuekou by car yesterday and traveled hundreds of miles by land. I saw that the people along the way were living and working in peace and were building houses one after another, which shows that the local vitality is not too difficult to restore. I plan to stay in Hankou for a few days and then go to the counties for inspection, or go to the Xindi area first to supervise the troops and consolidate the civil defense of Shashi, Shayang, Bailuo Lake, and other places. Once everything is in order, I will go to Yuekou (October 27).</p>
<p>Bandit Suppression Headquarters Orders Three Provinces to Promote Rural Cooperation</p>
<p>▲ Divided into Four Types: Credit, Utilization, Supply, and Marketing</p>
<p>▲ Implementation Limited to a Specific Time in the Bandit Suppression Areas of the Three Provinces</p>
<p>The Bandit Suppression Headquarters of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui Provinces promulgated the Regulations on Rural Cooperatives in Bandit Suppression Areas on the 24th, as well as the Model Charter of Credit, Utilization, Supply, and Marketing Cooperatives, instructing the governments of the three provinces to earnestly promote them. The original order is as follows: "It has been found that our country has resided on the mainland for thousands of years and has taken agriculture as the foundation of the country. The people who depend on it to increase wealth are primarily farmers. The national destiny is entrusted to the countryside. Therefore, the political and educational facilities of all dynasties have all taken benefiting farmers as their goal. When farmers are happy in their work and have a place to live, the political situation will immediately advance to stability. When farmers are poor and uneasy, the world situation will inevitably tend to chaos. There is no doubt about the truth of this, judging from both ancient and recent times. Since the late Qing Dynasty, after the long war of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the vitality of the people has not yet recovered, and the pressure of foreign forces has deepened. The opening of the five ports has opened the doors and windows, and economic aggression and control have been in the hands of others. On the one hand, foreign goods have come by boat, and funds have rushed out. On the one hand, the level of living has increased daily, and agricultural prices have fallen. Diligent labor throughout the year is not easy to clothe oneself, nor to be full. The rural economy has been fundamentally shaken. Moreover, with years of chaos, disasters have been linked to soldiers. Miscellaneous taxes and levies have been heavily levied. The Red Bandits have taken advantage of this, and the poison has spread. The central part of the Yangtze River, which occupies the most important position, has been ravaged by half. Even in areas without bandits, agriculture is on the verge of bankruptcy. The silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the tea in Anhui and Fujian have all failed in order, so that the so-called agricultural country is unable to supply rice, wheat, flour, cotton, yarn, tobacco, and sugar, which are pure agricultural products or semi-finished products. Instead, it relies on foreign countries. This kind of import reaches 560 million yuan every year, almost accounting for the entire amount of excess imports. It is willing to be inferior and defeated and is becoming increasingly withered. The world is in an uproar and has lost its desire to live. The reason for this is that since the opening of the sea, the court and the public have devoted themselves to foreign affairs. Ways to revitalize industry and commerce may still be seen in a few measures, but agriculture, the foundation of the country, has been neglected. The Party bears the mission of building the country and has always attached importance to the countryside. It wants to seek welfare for the majority of toiling people. Unfortunately, it has not been</p>

<p>Commercial News: Powerful Fluctuations in Finance, Spot Gold Prices</p>
<p>▲ Major Storms Frequently Occur</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market suddenly saw significant changes. There hadn't been turbulent waves for many days. Initially, the morning market saw a rise and fall in larger bars of gold, primarily due to the tightening of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, buying parties, after entering the market, reached a peak, resulting in a new high price of 762.2 taels. At noon, many parties took the opportunity to release their holdings, and as the US dollar strengthened, it returned to the 660 tael mark. From morning to noon, there was a difference of more than eight taels, with fluctuations of just over two taels within that range. Initially, the afternoon market was relatively stable. Subsequently, news spread that the economic conference would be successful. Upon hearing this news, the market was alarmed, and a wave of selling swept through various firms. Prices seemed to plummet like a river flowing downhill, suddenly falling to 552 taels. However, the situation was extremely chaotic, as if people were insane. Although subsequent advances and retreats were sudden, industry players lost their composure and were unsure of the outcome. As a result, the difference also exceeded eight taels. Finally, the selling momentum subsided slightly, with a decrease of 3.1 taels compared to the previous day. Regarding the November contracts, Hengxing bought 105 bars from Yingti Heng in the morning, with a premium of 3.5 taels. The day's situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ New High Price in the Morning Market</p>
<p>From the opening of the December contract in the morning, the price immediately fell by three taels to 750.5 taels. Although the US bank did not change its rates, private telegrams indicated a significant increase of 1/16. Unexpectedly, the larger bars of gold rose by 3/8 to 5/16. Subsequently, the increase was reduced to 2.8 taels. Shortly after, Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yongyongfeng, and others bought in, and because McCallie absorbed 9375 of January US dollars and Wah Bi absorbed 8125 of November, the price increased by two taels, reaching 4.9 taels. Shortly after, it decreased by 1.34 taels, as HSBC released 75 of December British gold. Subsequently, HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, at 4.7 taels. Then, Hengyu, Zhaofeng, and Chang bought in, increasing the price from 4.2 to 5 taels. After 9:30 AM, the price was suppressed by 1.2 taels.

Furthermore, Hengyu Yuanheng Fuyu Dehe Fuxing Yong Zhifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang, and others surged in, pushing the price above 660 taels. By 11:30 AM, the price reached 61.2 taels. However, Wah Bi suddenly released 5625 of November US dollars, and Hengxing Dadecheng Yifeng Yong Yuantai Yuanheng and the Dalian gang successively disposed of their holdings, causing the price to plummet by 2.5 taels to 58.7 taels. The noon closing price was 8.9 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Afternoon Market Greatly Affected by Rumors</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 58.5 taels, with Hengyu and others buying in. This was due to Pan Gen absorbing 75 of February US dollars, Wah Bi and Zhengjin engaging in recent trading of 5625, and the release of 625 of December shillings. (Bombay entered at 2:15 PM at 9.5 taels, followed by 75 of January being settled. Subsequently, HSBC released 8125, and Daxing Yong Yuanmao Yong Hengyu Zhaofeng Chang, and others released their holdings, causing an immediate drop of three taels, reaching 6.5 taels around 3:00 PM. Finally, Citibank absorbed 8125 of January US dollars, and Hengyu, Neixing, Zhifeng Yong entered the market to buy, suddenly pulling the price up by 2.5 taels, with only one tael of return. Around 4:00 PM, HSBC absorbed 75 of January US dollars. At this time, Yuanheng and others bought in, reaching 60.04 taels at 4:10 PM. Suddenly, rumors spread that the economic conference would be successful, and Wah Bi released 875 of February US dollars. Yifeng Yong Fuchang Hengyu and others sold off their holdings, and various firms followed suit, acting as if drunk or insane. At 4:15 PM, the price was 53 taels. Immediately after, 3.2 taels were added, reaching 6.2 taels. However, with people's minds unsettled and in a state of extreme fear, only three minutes passed before 4.2 taels were lost. At 4:20 PM, the price was 52 taels. After entering, the situation became chaotic and helpless, with fluctuations of one or two taels occurring in an instant. The Dalian gang and Fuchang chased in, bringing the price to 54 taels at 4:21 PM. At that time, the price decreased slightly to 2.5 taels. By the 4:30 PM closing, the price was 3.4 taels, a decrease of 3.1 taels compared to the previous day, reversing the three-day upward trend.

<p>Yarn: The Yarn Market is Increasingly Quiet</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market remains calm, with no clear ups or downs. Business is quite light, and the market atmosphere feels increasingly loose. Both long and short positions are holding steady. However, overseas cotton yarn conditions are slightly improving. As for the military affairs in Sichuan, although they have not subsided, the gang there is slightly purchasing futures yarn. The amount of cotton yarn delivered this month is over 4,000 bales, with Yongan Factory being the only one buying in, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ No Major Gains or Losses in the Person-Tagged Market</p>
<p>The person-tagged market opened in the morning, and the market atmosphere was firm following the rise in foreign cotton, rising nearly 3 qian. In the second and third sessions, the market suddenly fell back. As a result, each month fell by 4, 5, 6 qian to 1 liang. In the afternoon, the market rebounded slightly by 1, 3, 6 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 12,000 bales. It was found that Guangfeng sold 600 bales, Renfeng 550 bales, Dachang 550 bales, and Jifeng 300 bales. Yichang bought 800 bales, Changfeng 2,400 bales, Rongxing 500 bales, and Yongda 450 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>▲ More Spot Goods and Futures</p>
<p>The removal of spot yarn is still good, but futures account for the majority. According to statistics, various gangs bought a total of 1,200 bales throughout the day. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. Yihe Factory released 5,000 bales of 20-count Fufu Shepherd yarn, with a premium of 141.5 taels without tax, for the November-December period. The amounts bought by various parties are as follows: Guangdong 125 Shantou 50 Luzhou 75 Wuhu 30 Fujian 5 Ningbo 30 Mainland 55 Anqing 105 Sichuan 800 Peers 5200 Total 6380 bales.</p>
<p>A Quiet and Tired Cotton Market</p>
<p>The cotton market is flat and tired, but US cotton is rising slowly. Exchange rates are still high, and gold prices are rising step by step. The market should have hopes of rising, but unfortunately, yarn sales are not strong. In addition, the pressure from a certain manufacturer is very heavy. As soon as the market slightly rises, a large amount is sold off, and the market conditions are still difficult to recover. However, ordinary retail investors see that US cotton is stable, and farmers in all directions are unwilling to sell at low prices. They take a wait-and-see attitude towards standard cotton at 31-32 liang, so trading in the market appears bleak and weak.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng-Tagged Transactions Are Not Enthusiastic At All</p>
<p>The Zheng-tagged market opened in the morning, and the sentiment was still good due to the continuous rise in US cotton. However, major players sold off, and each month fell again by 1-2 qian. The afternoon was flat. The total trading volume for the day was 26,700 dan. It was found that Changhe sold 2,300 dan, Yuchang 1,400 dan, Senkang 800 dan, and Dafu 800 dan. Ruidi bought 1,300 dan, Huachang 1,500 dan, Yuandi 1,100 dan, Tongxing 800 dan, and Yongda 800 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>▲ Various Factories Are Buying Raw Cotton</p>

<p>Foreign Cotton Market Slightly Improves</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was active. It was initially tired due to the issuance of cash in the south, but then it was firm due to Japanese merchants' trading. Futures rose by 5 to 9 pounds, and spot goods rose by 5 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 12-13 points, and spot goods rose by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 3 points. Indian cotton was traded by Japanese merchants, and European exporters sold out. The market was firm and stable. Pingguo Er rose by 2.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 4.25 rupees, and Bailu rose by 4 rupees. The original records are on the left (27th Telegram): US Cotton Compared to Previous Day Converted to Shanghai Rules 126 7 Up 6 28.6 1641 5 29.4 7670 6 30.3 10 685 9 31.0 Spot 645 5 29.0 British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Converted to Shanghai Rules 12 428 Up 12 32.50 1527 12 2.40 2528 12 52.50 3530 13 52.60 Spot 561 9 54.6 Egyptian 778 3 48.8 Pingguo Er 173.75 Up 2.50 24.70 Aomula 192.25 Up 4.25 37.40 Bailu Creek 212.25 Up 4.00 30.30</p>
<p>Two Reports from the Tianjin Cotton Yarn Market</p>
<p>▲ Cotton</p>
<p>(26th) Tianjin News: The cotton market in Xihe is more active. Good goods remain stable and healthy, while secondary goods remain low. Sales are quite brisk.

Another 1,244 bales were bought, with an asking price of 23.6 taels. Another 300 bales were bought, with an asking price of 23.8 taels, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>(26th) Tianjin News: The cotton yarn trade in this city is still quite fast and sensitive, with a flat and tired atmosphere. The Cuihuangkou gang bought 10-count Shiquan yarn for 118 taels. The Xianghe gang bought 16-count Baxian yarn for 123 taels. The Huangzhuang gang bought 10-count Lanhuyarn for 118.5 taels and 10-count Songhe yarn for 117 taels, it is said.</p>
<p>Grain</p>
<p>The Rice Market is Scarce and Sales Are Active</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sources for various gangs were scarce, about 7-8 ships. The enthusiasm of urban and rural stores was not very strong. White rice, Hundred Brother rice, Wild rice, Nitrile species, and other goods all had a slight premium. Suzhou-Tonggang arrived with three cylinders yesterday, and they were sold out in full that day, with the price increasing by two feet.</p>
<p>▲ New Gate</p>
<p>About 26-27 ships arrived at the Suzhou River wharf. The opening of each cargo was initially loose but then hardened. Changzhou and Jiangyin rice each had a premium. Light rice and Flying Phoenix arrived and sold at a balanced price, maintaining the original price. Yanglu tip arrived with strong demand but weak sales, with a downstream trend. Yangke indica each rose by one jiao.</p>
<p>丨Min Gang Actively Buys Hunan Rice丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice customer conversion stalled, but there were inquiries in this street again. Hunan rice continued to arrive, and Fuzhou was very greedy for sales. The Northern Gang also had an appetite. The price increased by one jiao each compared to the previous market, which was a very good situation. If there are large batches of customer conversions in the future, the market may have to rise again. Although there are about 600,000 bags of foreign rice in stock, there is little circulation. Although there were arrivals from Hunan in recent days, there were inquiries from the Tianjin and Fuzhou northern and southern gangs, which were cleared out as soon as they arrived. The price also looked good. Saigon No. 1 was offered at 200 bags at a price of 9 yuan 2 jiao 6 fen, and Xiaojiao 100 bags at a price of 7 yuan 8 jiao half. Both were handled by this street. Another 90 bags of Hunan machine oil rice were priced at 9 yuan, another 50 bags of machine Jing rice were priced at 8 yuan 9 jiao, and another 273 bags of machine Yuan rice were priced at 10 yuan and 3 jiao 2 fen to 10 yuan and 3 jiao. Among them, 170 bags of machine Yuan were handled by Tianjin, and the rest were handled by the Fuzhou gang, it is said.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Mark Flour Transition</p>
<p>丨Foreign Wheat Returns: Buying Sentiment Is Strong, and Short Positions Are Urgently Covered丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market had a firming trend in each month after the opening in the morning. Foreign wheat quotations rose by about 2, 3, 4, or 5 jiao, and the attitude of large factories changed. They planned to take advantage of the low price to stabilize the market. They did not want to deliver warehouse receipts for this month, and they also intended to release prices for the long-term. Market sentiment was aimed at factory owners, so they also changed their views. Therefore, buying sentiment was strong for a while, and some short positions were also eager to cover their positions. Each period, near and far, rebounded by 2 fen or less compared to the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere in each month was slightly weaker because a certain factory still insisted, while small and medium-sized factories still issued hinges, and the pricing of spot foreign wheat was still low. It was heard that Fuxin had continued to order a ship of Australian wheat, estimated to be about 8,000 tons, with a price of 3 taels 5 qian 7 fen. Under such circumstances, the fall in prices will inevitably be subject to foreign constraints. As a result, October and November rose by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, December rose by 2 fen, January rose by 1 fen, and February rose by 7.5 li, and March rose by 5 li, it is said.</p>
<p>Futures Wheat Is Consistently Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market showed a consistently favorable trend in each month after opening in the morning and afternoon. This month's contract has already been closed the day before yesterday. It was heard that the delivery volume was about 50 vehicles, but both parties had already closed the position beforehand, which was an early delivery, so there were few warehouse receipts. In the remaining months, the quotations for foreign wheat were good at 2, 3, 4, or 6 jiao, and outsiders' sentiment saw an increase. Because there were really fewer chips this year, anyone who had booked foreign wheat sold flour short, unlike last year's tagged wheat, the market was easier to be bullish for a reason. As a result, November was unchanged, December was up 5 fen, January was up 5 fen, and February and March were up 3 fen. The spot wheat market conditions were still stable, but trading was very light. Only Bengbu wheat was offered at 3 taels 3 qian 2 fen, with 350 bags being handled by Fuxin, it is said.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat Turns Firm</p>
<p>Xinfeng Yanghang Report: On Thursday (the 27th), Chicago wheat turned firm due to slightly better export demand and firm Canadian wheat. Each period rose by 0.75 to 1.00 pound, and 40 million bushels were traded on the 26th. The market conditions for the 27th are listed on the left. Closing Price Compared to Previous Day December 45.50 Up 0.75 May 51.25 Up 0.875 July 52.50 Up 1.00</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<p>The Dutch Red Price Continues to Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was firm with spot gold and Dutch exchange rates. The association's draw plate of No. 24 raw granulated white sugar was still unyielding on the seller's side. The initial call was 15 taels, then 14 taels 9 qian 5 fen, and finally, due to sluggish actual sales, there were no transactions. No. 24 ground granulated white sugar was 15 taels and a half, No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 14 taels 4 qian, and No. 18 was 14 taels 2 qian. All remained firm. However, the Dutch Red market became sharper again. No</p>

<h3>A Bizarre Female Corpse in Kangjia Bridge, West Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Husband and Wife Quarreled, Husband Left Home</p>
<p>▲Wife Followed, Never Seen Returning</p>
<p>▲The Landlord Received a Letter, Petrified</p>
<p>▲Wife's Body Found in the Attic</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 28th) at 4 p.m., a bizarre murder case suddenly occurred in the Jinjia Alley near Kangjia Bridge on Great Western Road, West Shanghai. The information obtained from the investigation is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Husband Unemployed, Wife Still Extravagant, Residing on Great Western Road</p>
<p>Wang Abing, a local resident living at No. 13 Jinjia Alley near Kangjia Bridge on Great Western Road, rented the attic room on the upper floor to Zhang Zhenyuan, a native of Hubei, and his wife, Ms. Qin, a few years ago. Zhang was originally employed as a senior clerk in a foreign firm, with sufficient income to cover their expenses. His wife, Ms. Qin, was in her early twenties, a native of Jiujiang, and was naturally flirtatious and fashionable. Since Zhang lost his job last winter, their finances have become strained. However, Ms. Qin remained extravagant and unable to fulfill her desires, leading to frequent quarrels and a significant decrease in the affection between the couple.</p>
<p>▲After a Quarrel, He Abandoned the Family and Left</p>
<p>They had been renting the place for nearly two years. They rarely interacted with the landlord, Mr. Wang. This year, the landlord also ignored their frequent disputes. On the morning of the 25th of this month, the couple had another big quarrel. After a while, Zhang angrily locked the door and shouted to his wife, Ms. Qin, "I want to leave home and go far away, do whatever you want!" and left. Ms. Qin immediately followed, and she has not been seen since.</p>
<p>▲The Letter Arrived, Scaring Him Out of His Wits</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, around 3 p.m., the landlord, Wang Abing, was talking to his wife when a postman delivered a letter. Wang received and read it. Seeing that there was no sender's address, he opened it. The content roughly said, "There is a corpse in your attic room. It may have already decomposed. Please check it immediately," and there was no signature at the end. Wang, after reading it, was frightened out of his wits and greatly surprised. His wife, Ms. Xu, seeing her husband's face pale with horror, repeatedly asked what was wrong. Thinking that the Zhang couple had both been out for two days, how could there be a dead body? At first, the Wang couple did not dare to go and check, and immediately went to the Sixth District Police Station to report.</p>
<p>▲A Woman's Body Abandoned Under the Bed</p>
<p>The police station sent officers to accompany Wang upstairs. Seeing that the attic room was still locked, they broke the lock and entered. The bed curtains were gone, and a bundle of old bedding was placed in the bed. Under the bed, clothes and bedding were piled messily. After removing the clothes and bedding, they found a woman's body wrapped inside. Upon closer inspection, they realized that it was the tenant's wife, Ms. Qin. The landlord couple were even more shocked, as they had seen her leave but did not know how she had returned. They could not figure it out, wondering if the couple had secretly sneaked back in.</p>
<p>▲Whether There Are Injuries Awaiting Examination</p>
<p>Later, the Wang couple, along with the police officers, went to the Sixth District Police Station to report. After receiving the report, Chief Tan immediately ordered Officer Cheng to conduct an investigation. They thoroughly examined the woman's face and head, but there were no obvious injuries. Whether there were any injuries and how she died would need to be determined through an autopsy. As the case was bizarre, they ordered the local bailiff to report it to the court for an inquest and further investigation.</p>
<p>Jian Zhao'nan's Son's Suicide Attempt and Recovery</p>
<p>▲A Dispute with His Lover</p>
<p>▲Attempted Suicide by Taking Lysol</p>
<p>Qing Man, the 32-year-old son of Jian Zhao'nan, the owner of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, had an inextricable relationship with a Guangdong woman named Zhang Guoxiong. Zhang had been residing at Room 605 on the sixth floor of the Dadong Hotel on Nanjing Road since the 18th of this month. Jian visited her every day, often going out with her. The two seemed to be in love. However, good things are often hard to come by. Recently, there had been conflicts between them. Yesterday morning, around 2 a.m., Jian drove his own car to the hotel to pick up Zhang for dancing. After sitting for a short while, Zhang suddenly left her seat. Jian thought she might have other matters to attend to and did not pay much attention. However, she did not return for a long time. Jian then went to look for her everywhere, but could not find her. Jian returned to the hotel alone and found Zhang already there. The two had another conflict, neither willing to give in. Jian then took out a bottle of Lysol from his pocket, opened it, and drank it. At that time, Zhang and Jian's friends were nearby but could not stop him. They immediately reported to the hotel front desk, who then reported to the Lao Zha police station and notified the Central Fire Brigade to send an ambulance to take Jian to Renji Hospital for treatment. Zhang and Jian's friends also went along. They immediately notified Jian's wife by phone, and she arrived shortly after. Upon seeing another young woman in the ward, dressed fashionably, she became suspicious. Jian's friends then told her what had happened. Meanwhile, the doctor urgently used an antidote to save him. Fortunately, he had not ingested much and the treatment was effective. By 8 a.m. yesterday, he was able to speak a little. Jian's family then applied to the hospital for his discharge. With the doctor's approval, he left the hospital around 11:20 a.m. accompanied by his wife in a car. At the same time, Zhang also moved out of the Dadong Hotel. The details of what happened are kept secret by his family, but it is likely due to relationship problems.</p>

<p>▲The Social Affairs Bureau Is Scheduled to Send Personnel to Mediate Today</p>
<p>The entire workforce of the Dachangde Silk Factory in Hongkou went on strike over a wage dispute. They had previously engaged in a work slowdown after government mediation. The government is scheduled to send personnel to mediate today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Cause of the Strike</p>
<p>The factory has a total of 60 workers who originally wove 120-count rayon, with a wage of 2.4 cents per foot. Recently, the factory switched to weaving 90-count rayon, and the daily wages of all workers were 2.5 cents less than before. They sent representatives to negotiate with the factory manager, He Shengshan, requesting a wage increase to 3.3 cents, but it was not approved. They then went on strike and petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, which sent personnel to mediate, and they resumed work. Yesterday morning, all the workers, feeling that the factory had no sincerity, went on strike again.</p>
<p>▲Labor and Management Petition</p>
<p>Worker representatives Li Kangde, Chen Xianyou, and others submitted a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m. Management representatives, including He Shengshan, also went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. Both were received by mediator Zhu Guilin, who promised to report to the bureau director for review. The workers' petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Petition for reporting a strike: Since the opening of the Dachangde Silk Factory, the raw materials used were initially good. However, the management changed to using inferior materials in order to increase profits, which affected the workers' livelihoods. Although representatives were elected to negotiate with the management, the manager stubbornly refused to acknowledge the issue, claiming that changing the raw materials was a matter of the factory's administrative freedom and that the workers could not interfere, leaving no room for mediation. Upon hearing this, all the workers were extremely angry and indignant. Therefore, they automatically went on strike this morning. We earnestly request prompt mediation and will be grateful."</p>
<p>▲Mediation Today</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Social Affairs Bureau, reportedly through the responsible Third Section Chief Xu Yefu, appointed a mediator to handle the matter and scheduled a meeting for both labor and management to come to the bureau for mediation this morning, in order to prevent the labor unrest from escalating.</p>

<p>Jiangwan Flood Victims Continue to Request Relief</p>
<p>▲Municipal Committee Reports the Situation and Cables for Instructions</p>
<p>Wu Xuen, Yan Enzuo, municipal committee members of the Jiangwan district, continued to cable the municipal government and the Shanghai War Zone Relief Committee, saying: (Omitted above) Refugees from Qiaori and Beixiang gathered here, requesting relief and house construction. We cabled for instructions. In recent days, refugees from the four villages have sent telegrams requesting relief and house construction, no less than four or five hundred people, and the situation is very turbulent. Although the committee members have repeatedly tried to persuade them, they do not believe us, saying that the house construction loan is allocated to the victims by the government, and accusing the committee members of embezzling funds. If no practical solution is shown to them, in case of an accident, the committee members will not be able to bear the responsibility. Therefore, we cable again for instructions. It is heard that the municipal government has forwarded the letter to the Shanghai War Zone Relief Committee for review.</p>
<p>The Timber Industry and Others Jointly Petition for the Construction of a Lighthouse at the Southeast Corner of Huijiao</p>
<p>▲The Old Pole Light Has Collapsed After Years of Use</p>
<p>▲The Current Is Turbulent and Navigation Is Dangerous</p>
<p>Ma Jiliang, representative of the Municipal Timber Trade Association, Zhu Ziqian, representative of the Sandboat Trade Association, Cheng Youfu, representative of the Floral Trade Association, and others sent letters to Luo, the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, Tang, the Customs Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Hu, the Director of the Nanshi Branch of the Jianghai Customs, stating that:</p>
<p>"Petition for the construction of a lighthouse to ensure the safety of ships due to the collapse of the old pole light and the danger to travelers. Nanhui Nicheng is located on the coast of the sea. The southeast corner of Huijiao is opposite Yangshan. All sailing ships pass through this route, and the current is turbulent and extremely dangerous. The local customs are known to be tough. If a ship runs aground in a storm, they will rise up to rob it, and they will not stop until the ship and cargo are completely gone. Therefore, navigators regard it as a dangerous road. During the Qing Dynasty, Wang Yuzhou, a gentleman of the town, reported the above situation to the county magistrate, who approved the deployment of the army to garrison the Tianhou Palace for protection and suppression. Sun Xiaopu, a cartographer, and Qiu Zhuxi, a timber merchant, jointly proposed building a light pole at the most important location to guide ships sailing at night. However, ships still encounter dangers. Moreover, the bamboo pole has collapsed after years of use, and the number of ships has increased compared to previous years, so the number of accidents has also increased, and the losses suffered by shipowners and merchants are countless. We sincerely request that you, in your compassion for the hardships of merchants, approve the swift dispatch of specialists to build a lighthouse at the most important location, so that ships can see the stars early in the morning even in foggy nights, and avoid dangerous beaches. In this way, the merchants will benefit immensely."</p>

<p>Important Officials of the National Government Flood Relief Committee Are Accused of Corruption</p>
<p>▲Yang Shucheng and Others Failed to Appear After Being Summoned</p>
<p>▲Waiting for a Reply from the Flood Relief Committee Before Further Review</p>
<p>Yang Shucheng, Quan Shaowu, Wang Fanwu, Zha Liangzhao, and other officials of the National Government Flood Relief Committee were accused of colluding in fraudulent activities and embezzling disaster relief grain and funds intended for the affected counties in northern Anhui. The victims in the disaster area not only reported the matter to the Control Yuan, which sent officials to investigate and file an impeachment, but also reported it to the Anhui Shanghai Fellow Association. The association collected evidence of corruption by Yang and others and appointed Li Zhenya, Lu Chewu, Hong Ding, Wang Zhuo, and Hu Peiru, standing committee members of the association, to file a criminal lawsuit against Yang Shucheng and the other four. The First Special District Local Court summoned them for trial. Because the defendants did not appear, the court ordered a postponement and instructed the plaintiffs to provide information for summoning the defendants. This was reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the date for the continuation of the trial arrived, but the defendants still did not surrender. According to Chinese constable Jin Wanrong's report, on the 25th of this month, at 9 a.m., the plaintiffs went to the Flood Relief Committee to summon the defendants.

<p>The Autopsy After Ye Sanbao's Murder</p>
<p>▲The Widow Accuses Liu Mapi of Being the Murderer, Living at No. 3 Yangjiazhai Road, Huayuan Shiqiao, Pudong</p>
<p>Ye Sanbao, a native of Ningbo, was shot and killed by Liu Mapi, a native of Shandong, for refusing to lend him five yuan. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. After the local bailiff Xie Along reported the autopsy to the local court, the widow, Ms. Ye Ma, also submitted a statement to the court, claiming that Liu Mapi was a bandit leader in Pudong, had committed theft, and had been deported by the Third District Police Station four years ago. Unexpectedly, he suddenly returned in recent years, and many people had been victimized by him. In June of this year, Liu Mapi suddenly borrowed dozens of yuan from Ms. Ye Ma's husband, Ye Sanbao. Ms. Ye Ma, fearing offending him, immediately sent him five yuan. Liu Mapi was not there. Unexpectedly, the next day, he dragged Ms. Ye Ma's husband to the Simeixuan teahouse in Wufunong, Lujiazui, and extorted him, claiming that he owed him five yuan, which led to an argument. Liu Mapi then declared that he would definitely kill him and told him to be careful. Therefore, Mr. Ye was wary and did not often go out at night. However, Liu Mapi, who lived in Sandeli, Lujiazui, sent his family away in order to commit murder. On the 27th of this month, he fired four shots at Mr. Ye, three of which hit him and killed him. When a barber came out to check, Liu Mapi fired a shot at him, shattering a piece of glass. Therefore, he is still at large in Pudong with a gun and claims that he will kill all of Mr. Ye's friends in order to prevent anyone from helping the widow seek justice. She requested that he be arrested as soon as possible. Prosecutor Yang, Coroner Shen, and others arrived at the scene and confirmed that the deceased had been shot twice in the body and once in the leg, and that he had died from the injuries. They ordered the widow to collect the body and authorized the issuance of a letter to the Public Security Branch and all police stations to arrest the murderer.</p>
<p>The Case of the Dancer Being Beaten</p>
<p>▲Qian Baoying Surrendered Yesterday</p>
<p>▲The Debate Ended, Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Wang Yingying, a woman from Songjiang, was a dancer at the Jiuxing Dance Hall on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. On the evening of the 16th of this month, at 12:30 a.m., while dancing, she was accidentally stepped on by Qian Baoying, a dancer from Kunshan, which led to an argument and fight. She reported it to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate. Qian had already fled, and only one accomplice, Lu Asan, was arrested, and transferred to the Second Special District Court. The police station filed a public prosecution against him for assault and had him detained, and ordered the arrest of Qian Baoying for interrogation. This was previously reported. The date for the trial of this case arrived yesterday. Qian Baoying learned that the court had issued an arrest warrant, so she hired lawyer Huo E'sen and surrendered yesterday morning. When she arrived at the court, the plaintiff, Wang Yingying, saw her and immediately reported it to the bailiff, who detained Qian. At 11 a.m., Judge Zhang Chaozuo continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. First, Yuan Jia, the police station lawyer, presented the indictment against Qian Baoying. Then, Huo E'sen, Qian's lawyer, stood up and declared to the court that Qian Baoying was surrendering voluntarily, not arrested. Qian testified that she was 21 years old, from Kunshan, and had come to Shanghai this spring after the war and joined the Jiuxing Dance Hall as a dancer. On the evening of the 16th, while dancing, she accidentally stepped on Wang Yingying's foot, and she apologized to her. Wang immediately scolded her for not having eyes and pulled her hair. She pushed Wang's hand away, and Wang bit her on both arms, which led to an argument. The manager, Deng Xiaoshan, and others came to mediate and pushed her out the door. Wang Yingying came to hit her again and tore two of her clothes. She did not hit Wang at that time, and she requested a clear investigation. Qian's lawyer then presented the two torn pieces of clothing to the court. Lu Asan testified that he was buying things outside when he saw the two women fighting and went to mediate. He did not help the assault. Cao Senxiang was also there to mediate, which can be proven. The plaintiff, Wang Yingying, also described how she was beaten and hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution to recover losses. The judge then summoned Deng Xiaoshan, the manager of the Jiuxing Dance Hall, and Cao Senxiang, a waiter, to testify about the situation at that time. The court then ordered the debate to begin. As a result, the court declared the debate concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the 31st. Qian Baoying and Lu Asan were released on bail and ordered to be available at any time. Deng Baoshan, the manager of the Jiuxing Dance Hall, bailed Qian and Lu out of the court.</p>

<p>Yu Baisheng, a native of Suzhou, had been working as a manager at the Yifenghe Silk Shop at No. 409 Jiujiang Road, owned by Wang Jiean. Recently, Yu discovered that the accountant, Cao Hanzhang, a native of Jiaxing, had been using public funds for private purposes. Therefore, Yu and Wang Jiean reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station the day before yesterday. After investigating, Chinese detective Cui Jinchuan found that Cao had embezzled a total of 11,960 yuan, which was all used for prostitution. Yu was suspected of colluding in the fraud and was detained. It was also learned that Cao went to the Yinmei brothel on Fuzhili, Guangxi Road, every night, so the police went to arrest him, but Cao had already fled after hearing the news. Therefore, yesterday morning, Yu Baisheng was transferred to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the police still needed to go to Jiaxing to arrest the suspect Cao. Therefore, he requested permission to temporarily detain the defendant Yu Baisheng. Judge Wu Zhen reviewed the case and briefly questioned the defendant, then ordered Yu Baisheng to be detained for a postponed trial.</p>
<p>The Aftermath of Wu Jiangguang's Youngest Daughter's Marital Discord</p>
<p>▲The Result of False Accusations</p>

<p>Suspect in the Baoshan Robbery Case</p>
<p>Temporarily Postponing the Transfer Pending Evidence</p>
<p>The home of Shen Jinfa, a villager outside the West Gate of Baoshan County, was suddenly broken into by several armed bandits on the 27th of last month, who robbed clothes and silver dollars. Shen reported the incident to the local authorities for investigation. The Baoshan Public Security Bureau arrested three suspects, Zhou Zhengkui, Shi Xinkao, and Zhou Bashi. Under interrogation, they confessed that there were many accomplices hiding in various public and Chinese concessions in Shanghai. The day before yesterday, Chen Long, a detective from the Baoshan Public Security Bureau, learned that two accomplices, Liu Mengnian and Liu Mengsheng, brothers from Jiangbei, were hiding under the names Chen Hongjiang and Chen Hongming at No. 3536 Yinghua Lane, Roberts Road, West Shanghai. He prepared official documents and reported to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau. Patrol officers and detectives jointly went to arrest the two Chens, seizing 26 bullets. They were taken back to the Sixth District for temporary detention. Afterwards, Chen Shen, the wife of Chen Hongjiang, reported to the Putuo Road police station, saying that four people in uniforms and two plainclothes officers suddenly came to her home and took her husband and brother-in-law away, and she did not know why. She asked for an investigation. The police chief sent Chinese Deputy Inspector Zhang Yuanqing to investigate and learned the truth. He pointed out that Yinghua Lane was located in the Public Concession, and the Baoshan County detective had arrested the suspects in the Concession without notifying the police station, which was procedurally incorrect. The Sixth District Public Security Bureau transferred the two Chens to the police station after negotiations. Yesterday morning, Chen Long, a detective from the Baoshan Public Security Bureau, submitted a report to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, explaining the situation and requesting a transfer. Chen Hongjiang and Chen Hongming testified that they were rickshaw pullers and ticket collectors at the Gonghe Terrace in Zhabei, and denied any involvement in the robbery. They claimed that they had often refused people who did not buy tickets to watch the show at Gonghe Terrace, which caused resentment. This time, those people secretly placed bullets in their house, intending to frame them as robbers. They requested a clear investigation and denied that they were Liu Mengnian and Liu Mengsheng. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the police were not aware of the arrest and that no detectives were present at the time of the arrest. Therefore, it was unknown where the bullets were found. Since the Baoshan County detective had not submitted official documents and had not presented sufficient evidence, he requested a postponement. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the report and ordered the case to be postponed for seven days, pending the arrival of official documents and sufficient evidence from Baoshan County. The defendants were returned to police custody.</p>
