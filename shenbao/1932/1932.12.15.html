<p>重行確定三月十一日决議邀請中日美俄參加主張在調解手續日採用李頓報告書九十兩章宣言或將重申不承認「滿州國」僞組織之原則</p>
<h3>分向中日兩方徵求意見</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國委員會、曾委托英代表西門。西班牙代表馬逹里加·法代表瑪錫格里·瑞士代表胡白及捷克代表皮尼斯、組織五人起草委員會、從速擬定一種草案、以便設法調解中日爭端、此項起草委員會之七作、幾已完成、明日午刻、最後　次開會時、草案文字必可確定、委員會對於草案内容、雖嚴守秘密、但已經閱看草案者、則有良好之印角、一般人以爲十九國委員會、星期四可以開會、而國聯非常大會、則於星期五或星期六召集云、（十三日哈瓦期電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）英·法·瑞·西·捷五代表之小組委員會、今日午後在極秘密之空氣中、集議兩小時半、當五代表出會議室後、彼等皆謂須守機密、不能稍洩討論之内容、彼等僅可告人者、工作未畢、明午尙須集會耳、但有理由可信小組委員會討論後、已暫時議定提案草案、將向當事兩造探悉其能否接受之意見、傳說其所擬提案、將言及李頓報告書、雖不切實接受報告書中首八章、但將主張以此八章爲調解工作之根據、</p>
<p>現聞五國小組委員會、已議定其提案與報告書之文字、如明午舉行第二次集會時、不發生意外事件、則此提案與報告書、大約可於明日午後提交十九委員會、聞提案重行確定三月十一日之决議案、並建議邀請美俄參加、提案之外、另有一報告書、言及李頓報告書、主張在調解手續中、採用李頓報告書第九第十兩间、衆信以上述大綱爲根據之方案、當可爲各方面所接受、小組委員會午後五時五十分休會、工作未完、明年再議、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國委員會所組織之小組委員會、以起草中日爭執案之决議案、而備呈交國聯大會者、今日已决定該决議案之内容、著重於中日間各解運動之急需施行、該决議復建議組織一廿三國委員會、聯同現在之十九國、再加以中國·日本·蘇俄及美國、惟美俄兩國、至今尙未表示願意加入該委員會之意、而華盛頓方面則已暗示、美國之合作、須視國聯大會之能否無條件决定不承認「滿洲國」爲歸依云、（十三日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）頃聞十九國委員會内小組委員會所擬審查報告决議案及宣言、已得十九國委員會其他委員同意、大約今日當可草擬完畢、逆料審查報告内將建議、由國聯大會通過李頓報告前八章、作爲進行此案之基礎、决議案將贊成組織調解委員會、邀美俄加入、至於宣言或將重申不承認「美洲國」僞組織之原則云、（十四日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）美國參加討論一層、委員會亦完全深知美國初不注意於李頓報告之如何處置、僅深信國聯應取一種立塲、比美國前此對於「滿洲國」所取立塲、尤當更進一層、逆料美國必俟國聯採取此種立塲、始願加入討論、又對於蘇俄、目下委員會亦知蘇俄之參加討論、將視各國能給予何種交換以爲斷、其外交委員李繼諾夫在此間談話時、曾謂十九委員國中、尙未承認蘇俄者猶居十國、若蘇俄貿然加入討論、不將處於可笑地位耶、且再若美國參加、則更有十一國尙未承認蘇俄矣、</p>
<p>雖然、目下有若干委員、然望明日終可有一具體决議案、提出討論、而秘書長德魯蒙亦謂、渠信星期五國聯大會、可以通過一决議案、準休會至一月中旬云（十三日國民社電）</p>
<h3>中俄復交後國聯將變方策非明白否認僞滿國美俄必將拒絶合作</h3>
<p>（南京）外交界息、中俄復交後、國際形勢　將轉變、關於中日爭端、國聯亦必須改變方策、蓋十九國委會本擬邀請美俄兩國參加、組織調解委會、但美俄兩國因國聯現時態度、不合兩國立塲、拒絶參加、衆料如國聯對李頓報告之事實部分及不承認「滿洲國」兩點、不作明白之决議、美俄兩國將始拒絶合作、而國聯對中日爭端、亦將陷於無法解决之困境云（十四日中央社電）</p>
<h3>日本有條件承認調解委員會案</h3>
<p>閣議决定四項原則</p>
<p>（東京）駐日英大使林德賽、勸内田外相承認調解委員會、昨日閣議、協議日本對調解委員會之態度、結果决定堅持旣定方針、昨千後二時、内田外相邀英大使到外務省、說明政府之原則態度、大意謂日本政府對於解决滿洲問題、如不與滿洲獨立之旣定於方針抵觸、亦不反對設置調解委員會、惟該委員會之權限、及美俄兩國之參加資格、尙不明瞭、故不能確答贊否、殊爲遺憾云、並要求英大使之諒解、會見後、即將此旨電訓日内瓦松岡代表、（十四日電通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）對西門代表提出之調解委員會案、内田外相與外務首腦部及軍部當局協議之結果、决定日本政府之原則的態度、通過於昨日之定例閣議後、即將此原則電訓松岡首席代表、至日本决定之原則、共分四項如下、㈠日本政府以滿洲問題之解决、惟有承認「滿洲國」之獨立、適用國聯規約第十五條則絶對反對、苟蔑視此、無論講如何調解的處置、日本政府原則上反對之、㈡調鏵解委員會之權限及組織苟不抵　此原則、可默認之、日本對此並不提出對案、㈢究以如何資格、招請非國聯會員之美俄兩國、刻尙不明、日政府認爲無　表示贊否之必要、然原則的反對招請美俄、㈣傳調解委員會有令中日兩當事國參加之說、日本政府向有原則、苟調解委員會不除外滿洲問題、則滿洲問題之解决、拒絶第三國之介入、故日本政府並不參加、（十四日電通社電）</p>
<h3>日代表團開會研究對策</h3>
<p>（東京）日内瓦電、日代表團十三日晨九時　開會、下午一時許始散、據聞現在日代表團最重視者、國聯勸中日兩當事國之計劃也、日本從來絶對反對第三國之干涉、故中日兩國參加多數國中則其結果、外國意見之作用比當事國之意見更爲强大、事實上成爲受他國之干涉因此日本反對此種計劃、代表國擬再開會研究對策後申請本國訓令、（十四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）日内瓦日代表部昨夜十一時十五分開代表會議、討論參加調解委員會問題、日代表意見分爲兩種、一則謂若參加、恐在不知不覺中被其牽制、致自　國聯術策之中排斥第三國參加之主張則不能維持、一則謂日政府方針已决定、如大勢不利於日本時、儘可再行原定策略、亦毫無損失、經審愼討論後决定參加松岡已請示於日外部云</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日駐日内瓦日代表分頭訪各國代表詳細陳述日本主張中日紛爭須由中日直接交涉、不容第三國參加之原委、懇求各國原恕云、（十三日華聯電）</p>
<h3>山海關衝突事日代表團致文國聯竟謂我軍向彼道歉</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）日代表團之表岡、復爲近今長城附近中日軍衝突事致文國聯秘書處謂十二月十日山海關華軍司令與日軍事當局商妥協定、承認乃由華方首先開槍、特向日方道歉、並允防杜以後再有此種事　發生、但南京外交部仍不顧事實、而於十二月十一日向駐華日使提出抗議云、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<h3>西門遄返倫敦</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）英外相西門定今夜返倫敦、以開杜千爲出席於十九委員會之代表、五人起草委員會定今日午後三時半集議、現料國聯大會將於星期六日開會、聞西門之返國、與法内閣之失敗有關、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<h3>中俄復交事件宋子文發表談話</h3>
<p>「兩民族間自由往來之途徑已清除阻礙深信定能於實現遠東和平上大有助力」</p>
<p>（南京）今日代理行政院長宋子文語國民新聞社記者云、「余於中俄兩國重復正規之外交與商務關係、極爲滿意、余常信代表中俄民族之兩大系人道主義間、天然有許多同情心、足以制勝國際政治上之幻想、余甚樂見兩民族間自由往來之途徑、今已清除一切阻礙、深信定能於實現遠東和平上、大有助力云、（十四日國民社電）</p>
<h3>東省問題謀解决端頼國人團結</h3>
<p>（南京）中央社記者今日訪外交當局、詢以中俄復交後東三省問題之解决、能否闢一有利之途徑、據云中俄復交後、可促進國際合作、創設遠東和平、但東省問題之解决、仍須國人精誠團結、一致努力、如國人能堅持長期抵抗、則自有收復失地之一日云、（十四日中央社電）</p>
<h3>張學良之談話</h3>
<p>（北平）張學良談、中俄國境相連、綿延數千里、關係密切、與美對加拿大同、自民十六年起、國交雖斷、商務關係仍存、東三省各地有俄領、俄西伯利亞各地有中國領、即兩國不能絶對斷絶關係明證、中國政治、素重睦鄰、中俄兩國過去因政治歷史不同、演成國交上惡變、誠爲憾事、今幸恢復常態、定能互以誠意發展友誼、在東亞與世界之今日、可爲足資紀念之和平曙光、（十四日專電）</p>
<h3>各方面之贊許復交與反共判若兩事</h3>
<p>（南京）首都各報對中俄復交、均表贊同　中央日報謂此爲數年來輿論之具體實現、並贊許外交當局这果敏、該報又稱邦交恢復、在外交上事屬尋常、無憂喜利害可言、外交運用之成敗、全屬今　朝野上下、若能益自警勵、則外交上之成功、未必不能由此造成云、新京日報謂中俄復交、與英法意承認德國軍備平等要求、同爲最近國際間兩件至有意義之事、中俄復交、爲兩國爲謀在遠東創設和平繁榮之新時代一種必要的外交關係之開始、復交與及共、判然兩事、對日問題、亦全在自己努力云、（十四日中央社電）</p>
<p>（香港）西南當局對中俄復交表示贊成、（十四日專電）</p>
<h3>駐俄新使將屬莫德惠</h3>
<p>（北平）某外交家談、駐俄新使將屬莫德惠、中央擬召朱紹陽赴京、詢對俄外交事件、（十四日專電）</p>
<h3>加拉罕任駐華大使說遠東銀行將復業</h3>
<p>（南京）中俄通商條約、及互不侵犯條　約之締結在駐俄大使未發表前、仍由顏惠慶氏負責進行、又外息、中俄復交後、俄國駐華大使、有由現任俄外委會副委員員長加拉罕氏回任之說、（十四日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）據外交息、蘇俄大使館將來仍設北平東交民巷舊址、因與我政府辦理交涉方便計、或將在滬設辦事處、蘇聯方面之遠東銀行及蘇聯通信社、均將於復交後正式復業、（十四日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）蘇俄駐華商務主任扎拉曼談、本人前因私事返國、此次回平、在航海途中、聞中俄復交息、頗感歡慰慶幸、年來中俄斷交後、兩國人民聯絡失掉、此次恢復邦交出人意料、關於恢復使館事、蘇政府尙無訓令、使領人選更談不到、至使館將來如何恢復、此時不能答覆云、（十四日專電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄各報評論</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯各地報紙、均以中俄之復交、爲已證明蘇俄之和平政策、已漸爲舉世所承認、並可認爲鞏固遠東和平之一大力量云、伊斯凡提亞報聲稱、因時局之益見緊張、及帝國主議之侵略政策已使中國明瞭前此爲某第三國家聳恿、而與蘇俄絶交之一著、已增加中國外交上之困難、該報復稱、中國現有極滂　之革命意識、但此事旣非蘇俄所能預聞、故其責任當然亦不能加諸蘇聯之身也、復有他報數種、宣布蘇俄政府这加意保護中國軍官蘇炳文等實因日本之屢次要求、將蘇炳文等引渡、或將彼等監禁於俄境、即用極非常嚴厲之詞句拒絶之、此舉實爲促成日内瓦中俄諒解成立之一原因也云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）伊資維斯狄亞報對於日外交部發言人所稱中俄復交不利於日本之言論、表不憤懣、謂日本外交家以爲中國如與蘇俄維持尋常關係、乃有害的、但中國與日本維持尋常關係、乃有益的、此種思想、實屬矛盾而不合邏輯云、（十四路透社電）</p>
<h3>日本圓滑致敗</h3>
<p>冀利用僞組織與俄締約蘇俄識破狡行友好絶望</p>
<p>（南京）中俄復交後、日外交界倉皇失措、殊爲狼狽、廣田有松岡之活動、全成泡影、日俄友好關係、因此全然無望、據外交界確息、日本之失敗、全由於其外交政策太爲圓滿滑、蓋日方原擬由所謂『滿洲國』出面、與蘇俄締結互不侵犯條約、而日本則處於幕後、俾所謂『滿洲國』之地位、旣得一層保障、而日本對蘇俄之軍事行動、仍可不受限制、此種狡行、早爲蘇俄識破、致形成今日之懊喪云、（十四日中央社電）</p>
<h3>東京報紙自認日本外交無能</h3>
<p>中美俄三國携手日本乃陷於孤立</p>
<p>（東京）本日東京朝日新聞關於中俄復交著社說論之曰、中俄復交、乘日俄外交之不備而發展者、其理由確實存在、蘇俄主面、屢向日本提議不侵犯條約、企圖日俄間政治的接近、日本乃一貫頑强拒絶之態度、此無可諱言、欲使蘇俄率先承認「滿洲國」、其事並不甚難、惟有待於日本政治的外交的活動耳、苟日俄滿三國、堅固握手、國聯等無論如何騷動、無介意之必要、今因中俄復交之結果、蘇聯對「滿洲國」從來好意的態度、雖不豹虎、然因與中國之關系、今後必受相當牽制、俄滿關係勢必較前紛糾、中途無端放棄日俄關係之日本無能外交、致有蘇炳文問題、其結果於日不利、蓋可斷言云、（十四日電通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於中俄復交、本日報知新聞著社說論之曰、我等對於中俄復交、無絲毫期待之　要、中日日俄之關係、苟如現在、不加改正、中俄兩國之接近握手乃必然的、且足令蘇俄迎合美國之意、竭全力然的、且足令蘇俄迎合美國之意、竭全力而要求其承認、如是圍繞日本之中美俄三國、勢必於日本背後握手、而日本乃成孤立之狀、希望政府强腰、勿使國民失望政府之外交手腕、而此所謂腰者、非靜而不動之謂也、（十四電通社電）</p>
<h3>駐俄大使人選</h3>
<p>在徵俄同意中不日可發表外傳王正廷陳友仁均不確</p>
<p>（南京）中俄復交後、雙方將互派大使、我首任大使人選已内定、在徵俄同意中、一二日内可發表、外傳王正廷或陳友仁將任大使、絶對不確、（十四日中央社電）</p>
<h3>俄大使訪内田</h3>
<p>（東京）駐日蘇俄大使托拉亞諾夫斯基、十三日午後三時訪問内田外相、關於中俄復交、詳細報告並要求諒解、内田外相答以禮儀的祝詞、（十四日電通社電）</p>
<h3>日商大起恐慌</h3>
<p>俄貨乘機向華傾銷日貨銷路將受打擊</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>三中全會開幕誠</h3>
<p>在東北問題已成僵局。内戰又接踵而起之情勢下。負有領導政治重責之三中全會正於今日開幕。集黨中領袖於一堂。相與共謀所以打破時難。重奠國基。其所以關係我民族之先死存亡者。實至鉅大。而國人喁喁所期望於斯次大會者。尤爲深切。</p>
<p>㢠顧自九一八以至今日。此種具有重大意義之集會。自一中全會二中全會以至國難會議學者會議先後凡四。在此數次大會中。舉凡禦侮救亡應有之方案。殆無不具備。惜乎此種方案迄今大都擱置案頭。以故國難之作雖已歷時逾載而國難之實質。依然原封未動。甚且更臻於嚴重艱難。</p>
<p>今日三全大會又開幕矣。所展現於三中全會之前者。爲東北問題。已由急劇之軍事侵略而成爲國際間之政治鬥爭。爲滿洲僞國。已由公然樹立而得日本之公然正式承認。爲馬占山蘇炳文軍諸部。已由艱難奮鬥而漸呈失敗之勢。在國内者則爲魯亂爲川黔亂。爲農村衰落。爲民生困苦爲盜匪　起故吾人欲於今日三中全會開幕之日。有以貢獻其葱蕘。而第覺瘡痍滿目。千頭萬緒。不知究應從何處開頭。</p>
<p>雖然。吾人認爲爲政之道。不僅在於枝節之改善。而尤在於路向之正確把握。如能正其路向。則循此途以前趨。雖一時不克即入於正軌。應亦不致大錯我國當前之問題。一言以蔽之。曰外患。曰内憂。就吾人所見。則當前應付外患之路向應爲「力」。而安定内憂之路向則爲「信」。</p>
<p>奚以言之。自九一八禍發至今。吾人徒信任國聯。而事實上東北問題之在國聯不過徒爲列强鈎心鬥角玩弄其縱横捭　技倆之工具。問題之究應如何解决。則終始惟有敷衍拖延。如此次英代表西門之發言。更已明白更强對此一問題之眞實面目。從可知公理正義之呼籲。皆爲待死。在當前之情勢下能抗禦侵略者惟有「力」。能挽救危亡者亦惟有「力」除「力」而外一。切皆爲空言。雖然吾人所謂「力」又應有一基本之認識即少數人之「力」。不如多數人之「力」。惟民衆之「力」。乃最爲偉大。惟政府能喚起秘衆與民衆合作。而民衆乃有發揮其偉「力」。脫捨民衆而言「力」則「力」不宏效不大終將無以禦悔救亡此其一解也。</p>
<p>其次。人民今日之所企望於政府者。厥爲事實惟事實惟事實乃能昭政府之「大信」。亦惟事實乃最能得人民之信仰。如曰「抗禦外禍」。則當即表現於事實。如曰「解紓民困」。亦當即表現於事實推而至於「精誠團結。「取消苛捐雜稅」。「言論自由」。則已言之即都應表現於事實此無他。「信」而已惟「信」乃能正紀綱。亦惟「信」乃能服人民。脫言行相背馳。事實與宣示懸殊如天淵。則「信」不立。威亦無由而立而欲樹立堅强有力之中樞。以除内憂。固事所難能。此則又一解也。</p>
<p>總之當前之國勢已危苦纍卵爲政者應着目於遠大。而勿　於局部之利害。眼前之細末。或個人之恩怨。信頼人民。與人民打成一片。集全民之力量以維護我民族之生存。是爲我民族之出路。亦即爲國民黨之出路。</p>

<h3>附條件償欵赫禮歐主張未能貫澈</h3>

<h3>英法聯合陣綫被破壞</h3>
<p>國民社十四日巴黎電　法國自第三次共和以來、現將第一次愆期付欵、雖以赫禮歐之警告國會、一旦愆付後、將破壞戰後之英法政治聯合陣綫、而衆院仍堅决反對在不收賠欵時償付戰債、卒於今日黎明以前、以四零二票對一八七票通過不信任政府案、於是赫禮歐内閣立於清晨六時俟總統起身後、即進公府呈送總辭呈、</p>

<h3>急進黨仍將繼起組閣</h3>
<p>法總統接受辭呈後、即命在新閣成立前照常維持政務、至繼任人選、似以社會黨沙敦浦（與赫氏同黨）最有希望、其次則該黨前領袖達賴蒂爾亦非無望、倘總統决定在參院選擇、則前與美財長梅隆談判戰債之貝倫傑·或前財長凱勞·俱屬有望、大約總統今日接見兩院議長與各黨領袖後、明日當有分曉、</p>

<p>按赫禮歐總理、係急進社會黨黨魁、於一八七二年七月五日、生於脫羅窪地方、自一九零五年起即任里昂市長、厥後當選爲羅恩省參議員、一九一六至一九一七年之間、在第六次白里安内閣中任運輸部長歐戰後、赫氏放棄參院議席、改入衆院、一九二四年時、左派同盟出而秉政、赫氏乃繼普恩賚而爲内閣總理、翌年被推翻、至次年又重行組閣、乃第一次出席衆院、即被推翻、自一九二六年七月二十三日至一九二八年十一月四日、赫氏與普恩賚内閣合作、担任敎育部長、嗣因政見不合乃率同急進社會黨退出内閣、自是而後、無論對于泰狄歐内閣或賴伐爾内閣、赫氏均以急進社會黨黨魁曁議會中該黨領袖之資格、與之對抗、直至今年五月大選揭曉、衆議院多數黨改屬左派、泰狄歐内閣因而辭職、赫氏乃於六月四日組成現内閣以至于今、（哈瓦斯社）</p>
<h3>打假電話赫禮歐政敵惡作劇</h3>
<p>路透十三日巴黎電　今日衆院辯論美債問題時、忽有一侍趨至赫禮歐總理前、謂英相麥唐納有電話至、欲與總理一談、赫氏即往與談、其人自稱爲麥氏私人秘書、據告英政府已變更意志、决計不付十二月到期之美債、赫氏爲之大慰、旋爲謹愼計、復接電話至倫敦外交部詢問眞相、始知頃發來之電話、乃屬假託、想必赫氏政敵所爲、</p>
<h3>王黨示威狂呼勿付分文給美</h3>
<p>在此電話事件發覺後、有保王黨千人、希圖衝破警察哨線、在衆院之前狂呼「勿付一文與美」、一時大起擾攘、迨警察大隊馳至彈壓、示威者已拔起二樹、使電車一輛不能行駛、暴衆中有三人因受傷、經送入醫院、餘人均被拘入警署、覊留一二小時釋出、午夜時又有保王黨一隊圖滋擾衆院、爲警察制止拘獲約二百五十八名、記者浦旭爾亦在其列、但即經開釋、</p>
<h3>比無力繳付内閣崩倒</h3>
<p>國民社十三日不魯塞爾電　比内閣已辭職、據聞戰債問題亦爲促其早倒之一大原因、蓋閣員大多數雖主張照付、無如財力不容其付欵、卒於辭職前由外部草擬一照會通知美國、聲明勢將有懲愆之必要、照會内聲稱、美國旣不能延長停付期、而洛桑賠欵協定、又斷送比國賠欵之收入、遂致無法應付戰債、惟比國準備與美合作、覓一解决方法、並希望更相合作、解决與戰債有密切關係之其他問題、按比内閣係天主敎與自由黨臨時聯合組織、、本料其不能長久、自選舉揭曉、兩黨意見更深、遂有不得不辭職之勢、今以戰債問題、遂益速其崩倒、</p>
<h3>英致美新牒重申保留</h3>
<p>路透社十三日倫敦電　就英國而言、英國已以最近牒文、說明戰債之情勢、最近英牒、一面重伸前次之保留、一面用更不致使人誤會之字句、下院議員今日爭向財相張伯倫詢問戰債事、合財相置諸不答、僅謂明日辯論時、渠將詳細陳述一切、財相又謂協約國間之債欵暫時停付、以待洛桑協定之批准、但政府切盼他日就世界恢復之關係、研究全部戰債問題時、能獲有可使列强批准洛桑協定之解决、美國今已依允將此全部問題重付研究矣、至於英國在現有還債協定下之權利皆整個保留、英法並未在一個聯合的陣線進行、英國擬於可能時與美國單獨解决云、</p>

<h3>胡佛代人受過遭彈劾</h3>

<p>國民社十三日華盛頓電　今日美國會内有共和黨衆議員麥克法登提出彈劾胡佛總統案、列舉四欵、㈠　奪國會權力、㈡浪費國家財源、㈢强迫人民制定不良法案、損本國而利外國、㈣企圖損害梁約之效力、指爲有大罪及失政、但贊助此案者僅七人、旋經表决、以三百六十一票對八票反對考慮此案、當此案提出後、旁聽席上忽有少年起立揮舞手槍、要求自由演說權利、當爲院警所逮捕、此兩事頓使國會内發生戰後未見之震激、但震驚稍定後、即復從事討論預算案、</p>

<h3>兩證人作有力證明惲蕙芳殆可無罪歟</h3>
<p>惲蕙芳因以炸彈投贈與私販仇貨之店舗、前被華界巡警拘獲、移解法租界第二特區地方法院、雖判徒刑、然以其未滿十六歲、宣告緩刑、但公共租界警務處因新閘路永昌煤號被蔡耀祖投擲炸彈、炸傷職員俞瑞樑一案、惲亦參預、故同第二特院移提至第一特區地方法院、判以共同施用足以致死之方法、傷害人一罪、减處徒刑三月、惲不甘服、具狀向江蘇高等法院第二分院上訴之、業於上月二十一日開庭審理、後因惲之律師提出證人數名、請求傳案質證、故遂展期、仰候傳證到案再訊、已誌前報、昨日午後爲該案繼續公開審理之期、爰記詳情如次、</p>
<h3>發給臨時旁聽券高二分院沈</h3>
<p>家彝院長、以惲案每次開庭、旁聽者踴躍異常、而法庭席次有限、以前數度開庭皆無限制致人多席少、庭内不免發生凌亂狀態、茲爲顧全法庭秩序起見特製一種旁聽券凡欲入庭旁聽者、應先領券、否則擯諸庭外、並以此項辦法、在該院尙係創舉故事前頒佈文告一道、貼於院門首、其文曰、爲布告事照得本院受理惲蕙芳殺人未遂上訴一案、定於本月十四日下午一時、在第一庭開審、茲因法庭内旁聽位次有限、爲免除凌亂擁擠起見、特製旁聽券、儘庭内所有旁聽位次編號發給、旁聽人位滿劵卽停發凡欲旁聽此案者、概須在本院司法警察室領取旁聽券、無券不得入庭除以後遇有適用此項旁聽辦法之案件仍隨時布告外、合行布告周知此布</p>
<h3>法庭内外之防範</h3>
<p>凡可通至第一法庭之正側各門、概於下午一時、經沈院長命令暫行關閉、並於各處門口配置武裝法警五六名、嚴　出入、而大門前則派西籍警目四名排立、凡入庭者須循此門而進、如無旁聽券絶對不容混入、以是鵠立於該院西首墻畔請發旁聽券者、不下四五百之多、就中形似學生之男女青年者甚夥、紛以名刺從窗口投入、俾換取旁聽券一紙、甫二時、發出之券、已告滿額、後至者多抱向隅之嘆、而持券人則魚　入庭、約計三百餘人、經庭内法警指位就坐、頓時人滿、始終秩序整肅、毫無以往漫無限制時之凌亂狀况、</p>
<h3>到庭人之題名錄</h3>
<p>上訴人　蕙芳到最早惲衣灰綢棉袍頭髮爲西洋式、面含笑容先至律師休息室暫憇、旋入第一庭、坐人叢中證人王吉生、王補經·繼至、尙有夏國鑫已離滬回籍而炸傷之俞瑞　傷雖早愈、但仍未遵傳到案、惲之辯護律師沈鈞儒·趙琛·李祖虞·丁部局律師厲志山·曁承辦該案之華探長趙炳坤、與西探等均於二時許相繼戾止、</p>
<h3>兩證人證言相同</h3>
<p>二時半、郁華庭長與趙鉦鏜郭璞兩推事、鍾檢察官、及書記官升座、開始審理、先傳證人新閘路七百二十一號銀樓職員王吉生訊問據王供稱、我店與永昌煤號相隔祗兩間、是日晨六時餘、我正洗面突聞聲響、出而視之、知永昌被入抛擲炸彈、是時見一人跑過維僅覩其人之背、但身叚實較惲高大、至惲則未曾見過又據新閘路七百四十六號米店職員王補經供稱、我店與永昌爲斜對面、其時我正在店門首聞巨響後、即見一人跑過身材較惲高大、當時之炸彈、係在永昌門前爆發、俞瑞樑立於永昌門内股部致被炸傷、因受傷輕微、故俞初猶不覺、且亦不歡往醫院、嗣因捕房探員到來調查、始　囑赴醫院、但當日仍出院回店、投彈人我並未見、因響後見一人飛跑、遂疑其人必係擲彈者云云、復由趙探長將辦理本案之經過情形重行報告、並將事後帶同惲蕙芳至出事地點命惲表演投彈情狀所繪之圖一紙呈案、庭上遂訊惲對兩證人之言有無意見、惲答曰、無、卽諭令開始辯論</p>
<h3>捕房律師之辯論</h3>
<p>先由捕房律師厲志山起立、將惲之上訴理由逐點辯駁略謂本案事實、庭上當已審究明瞭、被告上訴之理由無非希圖减輕罪責、如指　審判决之　　不當要皆爲　倒事實曲解法律之言、不堪置信、被告犯罪行爲雖由於愛國心所衝動、然旣經傷人、自應負法律上之責任、不能以愛國而倖逃法網且其在捕房之自白、旣經惲親自簽字、而此種自白、又非出於　脅復與所調查之事實相符原審作爲根據自屬正當今其縱將自白否認、但事實斷不許推翻、奸商行爲誠屬可惡、如資敵以糧等情、然自有國法制裁、近如胡立夫已被判罪、惟被告則無任意處分奸商之權、國家亦無准民衆處置奸商之命令、故被告所言正當防衛一點尤不適合、本案與法租界之案相比、雖其犯意相同而犯行及結果皆異故不能認係連續犯、最近捕房另案捕獲一潘洪生抄出照片一幀、惲與蔡耀祖皆與合攝、是惲對於該案、或亦不無嫌疑特將此　呈案、用作參考總之被告唯一理由爲愛國行動以爲司法機關、應予曲諒、惟彼已　犯法律自應依法懲治以符法治精神况其上訴復毫無理由應請駁斥、</p>
<h3>被告律師之答辯</h3>
<p>當被告律師答辯之前庭上復向惲蕙芳訊問據惲稱、前在捕房自白時神經異常錯亂故所述多不實在我確爲十六歲、係十二月十四日生辰、前供十七歲、亦屬不確云云遂由趙琛律師起而爲惲辯護分爲四要點、㈠犯罪主體錯誤、㈡犯罪客體問題㈢是否有共同犯罪行爲㈣犯罪是否出於故不能搆成原原判二百九十四條之罪、應將上訴人宣告無罪、或予免訴或認爲連續犯、乞秉司法獨立之精神、而爲公允之裁判云云、沈鈞儒律師亦繼起滔滔而辯、最後由李祖　律師發言、謂惲縱使與蔡耀祖同去惲立於道旁、而彈旣由察投、惲實不能負共同傷人之責、况其動機在愛國、萬一有罪、應請緩刑云云、鍾檢察官旋起發表簡短論告畢、庭諭候本月二十一日午後宣判、遂退庭、時已五名鐘矣、</p>

<h3>關於李天放君所提問題之討論</h3>
<p>丨參閱十二月五日本欄</p>
<p>江問漁君訊：當現在這個經濟恐慌百業凋弊的時候。每月薪水有一百五十元，平心而論，不能算少；因爲有許多學問好資格好的人，還未必能夠有這樣的收入。至於大學學生每學期用了二百餘元，似乎算多一些，如果在國立大學，節省一點。是用不了這麽多的；省立或公立的中學，每學期也用不了一百五六十元：小學那更不用百餘元了：由此看來，令郎和令愛所化的學費，還可以設法减少。</p>
<p>照合理的說法，要進大學一定以天資優秀能够考進好的國立大學爲標準，如不能隨便進費用很重的私立大學，本來是不對的。要進中學也應該以升學爲目的，如不預備人大學的話，儘可改入職業學校；就是要進中學，也應選擇好的，不應入無實際，而且學費銀大的私立中學。小學離家很近，向例通學，費用有限，似乎還不至成問題。</p>
<p>那麽，照上面的辦法計算，一個大學生每學年用三百元，一個中學　每年用一百八十元，兩個兩小學生每年合用六十元、共需五百四十元，多說一點，六百元已足夠了。足下每年的收入有一千八百元，緊去六百元，尙餘一千二百元，作爲家用，普通的生活已經算很好了　　依足下的情形看來，似乎無大問題；所認爲成問题的，還是一班薪水少的人。如尊函所說：某裁縫師傅的慘劇，却是令人生出無限的感慨！我想對於這個問題的解决，有下列幾種方法：</p>
<p>㈠大學敎育，要求質的改良，不求景的增多。凡子弟要入大學，必須眞正聰明優秀，入學人數當然不能過多，就是生長貧家，只要是眞止優秀，亦應由國家供給一切學膳等費，其他資質差一點的，應該多設中等以下的職業學校。或中等以上的職業性專科學校，以應其需要。此項職校畢業的無限，或長，或短，可依照各人的志願與經濟狀况而定。以後希望智識階級改變思想。不可誤於大學學的虚榮，把自已不宜於入大學的子弟送到大學去。好在以後大學能夠精益求精，質美而量少，天然的不能讀一班的好虚榮而無實學的人混進去。况且，不進大學，有了專科，也還是高等敎育嗱！高中畢業儘可去相機深造。</p>
<p>㈡前條如一時不能做到，希望各大學内多設免費的學額。以帮助一班貧寒而優秀的青年，可以減除他們父兄的担負。</p>
<p>㈢職業敎育。却是不能不推廣，職業性的專科敎育也應該多設立。這一層，希望政府負其責任，同時，社會方面要竭力去鼓吹提倡，以促其發達。尤其是一班智識階級，必須看定了自己的子女資質如何，然後分别定入學的標凖。</p>
<p>㈣應盡量的擴充補習敎育。凡是失學的青年，一概可以免費或最少量的經費，前去補習；若是小學畢業，無力升學，因而到商店或工廠去當學徒的，白天帮助社會生產，早起八點鐘以前和晚間七點鐘以後，儘可到這種補習學校去讀書。這種學校，除替他們補習初中課程，高中課程外。還要補授職業方面的知識技能！可以使他們按級而上，經過若干年後，沒有化他們的父兄什麽學費，也可以由初中而高中，由高中而專科得了充份的敎育。這種一面生產一面求學的青年，我們應該特别的贊助他。鼓勵他·敬佩他。若能將這種敎育推廣。就是沒有許多大學和大學生。社會事業仍然可以　展，社會生產仍然可以增加，以後，我們　　思想完全轉變過來，對於無聊的大學和瞎混的大學生，不必放在眼衷。專門注意這一類對得起國家。對得起社會。對得起個人的優秀青年，多多去替他扶植他。</p>
<p>這樣一來，父兄不用多化錢，子弟也可以上進了。這是一個最好的辦法。所以，我們希望社會方面。政府方面，對於這種敎育竭力擴充，在現行敎育制度下，能使他由附庸而　爲大國。</p>
<p>以上四項辦法，倘眞能實行，我想如足下所說的問題，大概可以解决了吧！</p>

<p>廣京十四日電　十四午中央建設西北專門敎育籌委會、在敎部開放立會、到于右任張繼吳敬　戴傅賢蔡元培等决議㈠秘書處規程交常委審核、㈡會址暫附設敎部、</p>
<h3>我國代表出席優生學會報告</h3>
<p>丨並開展覽會</p>
<p>在紐約舉行歐州參加者甚多</p>
<p>國立清華大學習美學生監督趙元任、頃將參加第三届國際優生學會及展覽會經過情形、呈報敎育部、報告原文甚長、茲摘要錄下、</p>
<p>該會與第六届國際遺傳學會、同時在紐約美國自然歷史博物館開會、遺傳會八月二十四至三十一日、在綺色佳康奈耳大會開會、歐洲許多生物學者參加、優生會八月二十一日開會、展覽會八月二十二至九月二十三日止、大部材料、由美國預備、中國因通知太遲、材料至二十幾、展會已將聞幕才到、第一天開會、請外國會員、與家族參觀、紐約省長島上的冷泉港的華盛頓、卡内基學會設立的遺傳學實騐所、與優生紀錄所、風景極佳、是日上午參觀幾所實騐室、到會人分作四班、每班有　響　、　着各研究員實騐工作、並加以說明、他們注重遺傳學、故養許多生物、都有很長很詳細的許多代的歷史、無論是優點、或病態的遺傳、都一樣的研究、故遺傳實騐所、名符其實、這一天在室外特别設一嗅覺實騐台、台上擺些有各種氣味的紙、讓客人去聞了、寫下好惡跟聯想的反應、下午回優生紀錄所、該所是一永久機關、他們的材料、大部由有過專門訓練田野工作員到各處調查得來的調查員女的多、光到一地方住下、與鄰居往來、俟得信任、漸漸間他們祖宗三代的歷史、他們材料之　格、只許研究的人參考、並且人的眞姓名、　登在原稿上備查外、從不發表、故被調查的知道這種辦法、就　說眞話優生紀錄所内有世界上所有　屬、　的家　、他們所載的年歲、速度·　　等變壧的因子、因爲有兩個以上的變數、就不能　平面上的曲線、故做了好些二度的立體模型、來代表各變數的函數關係有的像馬鞍形彤的、這完全是函數關係之幾何的代表、其實這種馬鞍形、完全不是因爲馬的緣故、</p>
<p>第二天上午正式開會展覽會亦開該會目的在求世界上人種的優美化、宣讀二篇論文及討論、一爲古巴的人民限制、二爲和蘭的鼓勵天才者多生之辦法、三爲不適宜于社會者的生殖的限制下午分組論文宣讀會計分三組、第一組總題目種族的區别與種族區别的量計法、及其在優生學的關係、第二組關于　　、　偶、生產率繁殖力的些論文、第三組論文都是講社會上的劣種與優生學的關係晚　正式宴會、接着在人　堂公開講演、主要題目是生產　擇與生產限制、第三天全體會議上午第一篇文章是和蘭的優生與敎育、又優生中之敎育、中間有人講優生中的指導幾方面、第二篇是婚姻指導第三篇是羅馬的優生與戰爭、下午分組論文宣讀會、按着第一天算起、第四組些文章關于生殖的生理、關于衛生與疾病之優生上關係、第五組是關于社會與優生學的關係的文章、第六組是些遺傳學的文章、睫上優生會與遺傳會聯合　餐、</p>
<p>本届到會後、深感遺傳學在優生的基本重要地位、前者是基本科學、後者是他在社會上的一種應用、現在世界對于遺傳學的智識有好些極重要問題、還者在研究之中、故一方面就已知道的事實可以鼓吹、跟推行優生的運動、而遺傳學的事實的探求、更是急不待緩的問題、這次開會、我國雖只有一外行到會、在國内雖只有把個人是專門研究優生學的、但在國内各學術機關與國外的學生當中事門學生物學、（包括遺傳學）者很不乏人、將來應用到優生問題時、就可以有相當的準備這也可以算是中國敎育的一種軌道上的趨向了、</p>

<h3>中大設國防化學講座</h3>
<p>聘黃新彥博士担任</p>
<p>前次敎育部召集全國化學會議、認爲國防化學非常重要、當經議决請中入武漢清華中山四國立大學、特設國防化學講座、中大　校長亦認國防化學關係民族生存問題、當經允許設立、現已聘定黃新彥博士担任、黃爲英國化學博士、係香港大學僅有之中國敎授、在科學界頗負盛望、於國防化學、尤有研侒、當化學會議時、即被推爲國防組主席此次經羅校長託人赴港力勸、黃博士亦有志爲國家機關服務、故寗犧牲香港優厚之待遇前來主講、實中大之幸、亦國防化學之好消息、</p>
<p>析能力、更應隨時提倡自動、一掃依頼虚僞之積弊、六·凡速寫整潔等習價、均應隨時訓練、使漸進於純熟自然、而　於藝術化、七·凡敎材具有特别歷史興味者、敎師最好能隨時提及、以引起學生之興趣、</p>
<p>㈡算術㈠算術中應採淺易之代數、如以字母代數、記述公式「如利息等」、以便預先灌輸代數觀念</p>
<p>㈡運算技能、貴能純熟敏捷、故應注意、（甲）嫻熟近似計算、明瞭精確度之意義、（乙）練習心算、（丙）儘量應用數表、如方根表、　利表等、　　㈢注重應用問題、如日用計算統計圖表等、</p>
<p>㈢代數·應注意方程式函數之研究、應用問題務取簡明而切實用者、函數觀念、宜從實便入手、並與變壧法及比例聯絡敎授、二·代數與算術關係極密切、宜多聯絡、如式之計算與數之算法多相類、宜切實比較聯絡俾易了解、又如函數値求法公式計算、均應側重數字問題、</p>
<p>㈣幾何一·幾何事項本爲直觀敎材、故應從實騐幾何入手、俾易於引起學生興趣而輸入明確之基本觀念、敎授實騐幾何、應使學生自動作圖度量在立體幾何中、更應自作紙板或他種模型無論平面或立體、凡關於度量之簡單公式應用實騐方法騐明之、二·理解幾何中應特别注意直線形以其爲以後各部份之基礎也、軌跡及作圖題只可僅授人要、圓及以後各部份、只宜擇要敎授、其定理及軌跡作圖題之之較難者、應待至高中時講角、三·幾何雖爲最重邏輯次序之科目、然初中學生每不能感受嚴謹推理之必要、故公理及假設之條數應增加、基本定理證明不易了解者、可暫認爲假設而不加證明、孤度·比例論·面積論中不可通約之理、不必提出、而應以近似值法代之、</p>
<p>附數値三角　三角之正式敎授、宜移至高中、但三角應用方面極廣、初中亦不可不知、故宜就實例入手、講授三角函數定義、及直角三角形解法、簡易測量餘可從略、</p>

<p>自由談他們的路（一）  葉影Ｈ·Ｂａｒｂｕｓｓｅ譯作　　在那長圓形的，俯視着村落的小山頂上，祗有着一座房子。　　牠恰好有位置在那圍繞着山頂的路的中心，以至凡是沿着這條路走到那兒的人，被逼得不是打回頭來，就得跑進這座房子裏面去。　　這座房子位置的不規則，雖然把一條村路完全阻塞了，！這條村路在房子後面繼續伸展着！但在這暮氣沉沉的聖　騰地方，並沒有引起什麽不便；並且這條緣着山邊的小徑，幾乎從朝到晚，從晚到朝，是一機荒凉着的。　　因爲位置的關係，這房子已經成了地形的一部份，從市鎭的側面看來，牠好像敎堂的鼻子似的。這屋裏侷促地住着一對夫婦，他們是沉默而又謙遜的人，白天在城裏工作，全沒有閑時去欣賞那和一個小禮拜堂似的房子昆連着，小小的開着花的園地。　　這丈夫和這女人並不是一個模型裏　出來的，啊，不是的！他，在兩顆碧綠的眼睛當中，長着一個尖尖的鼻子，下巴是凹進去的，他有着一種麻色的頭髮，聳立在堅强的玫瑰色的皮膚上。他呢，好嬌小玲瓏，恰好和牠丈夫那種不相連的魁梧奇偉作比例，！和那種魁梧奇偉對照！加上一種淡白的膚色和最優美的黑絲似的頭髮。簡括說，自頂至踵，有如日與夜的不同。但這些詳細的叙述是無關緊要的。最可以表現他們的，是他們互相依戀的生活着。人家從沒見過他們分散過。祗要離開一會兒，他們便必然的互相諦視着。他們同時笑着成微笑着，這並不是有意要做成一樣，實在因爲他們的内心是一樣的，他們的眼睛雖全不相同，但有着十分相似的凝視，幾乎成了奇蹟的凝視。　　據一般人的意見，這兩人實在相愛得太利害了。雖然他們是本地出生的人，雖然他們的姓名，早已傳遍了這個鄉村，但因他們只顧互相愛悅的緣故，在村中已成了疏遠的外人了。這種態度，像無論什麽過分的事情一樣，自然不會受人歡迎的，後來别人因爲他倆都很和善的緣故，雖然容許他們保持這種態度，但也不是得已才容許的，尤其是因爲别人曉得這事不會持久的緣故。　　在一只棕色的舊木匣似的房子外面，他們每早動身到隔着一里半路程的脫羅藏去。他們在城内的大街上分手的時候，丨有人瞧見他們分手的丨現着愼重與不自然的神氣，老是像第一次分手似的。在馬奴里建築物前面，他捨去了他的妻子　午後六點鐘，他在原處接着那離開了他而戰　着，在工廠的　陰下像乞丐般窺探着的她。　　在村裏那方面，人家每晚瞧見他們歸來：冬天，祗辨得出那細得像一顆星子的他們的燈　的搖擺；夏天，在黝黑的　雲上頭，在落日裏面，現出他們瘦小的半面影像。他們挽着　或握着手互相偎倚着。他們以一種嚴　的步法前進，他們好象由世界的盡頭回來了似的，他們老是有帶來了一種重要新聞的神情。　　丨瞧啦，他們在那邊！加斯巴咕嚕着。　　丨是呀。那非常年老的，牙齒像枯骨一樣白的，而遇着重要事情，祗知道說「是呀」這名話的勒蜜老嫗表不了意見。　　丨啊！那上了年紀的，假如曾爲办婦的話，已好做曾祖母的丹達姑娘低語着。　　那壞蛋，那無賴的基白也張開了嘴。但他並沒有吐出一句卑猥的話！雖然這種話他慌得狠多，而且常是逞口而說的。當然，别人不能當着這兩個在落霞的背景前面瘋了似的結合着的人任意呌喚。别人不能··他們就是這樣每天在村莊上，在那些居民裏面出去而又歸來。發生火災的那天，他們就是這樣離開了這個村落的。　　可怕的火災是在早晨十點鐘爆發的。由外面看來，火是從乾草堆發生的，風把燃着的細技吹到那木屋上去了。日本刀  星　　最近日本駐滬陸戰隊長鮫島回國，曾對日記者大放厥詞。他說：「本人任陸戰隊隊長凡一年，曾參加滬戰，積一年之經騐，深知對華人須抱有最大决心，深知日人欲在華立足，須常給華人嘗試日本刀的滋味。」鮫島旣「榮任」隊長，又曾參加過滬戰，而又萬幸不曾嘗着我十九路軍「抵抗」的砲彈，這次旣「衣錦」生還故國，自然　得效荒木之流的口吻，發表如此如此的「一年經騐談，」因爲不如此，不足以「自顯，」更不足以使少壯派的軍部「倖」而「垂青，」這裏，我們大可以把「國際禮儀」之類擺在一邊，體諒他的苦衷，原恕他的狂妄。　　不過，我們對於鮫島「大佐，」却也願意盡一點善意的忠告。我們希望鮫島善自珍護他的「日本刀，」在這次滬戰中，「日本刀」雖萬幸尙未澈頭澈尾的被顯露其「鉛刀」或是「竹刀」的原形，但在未來的「日美，」「日蘇」或是「日韓」以及其他的爭鬭中，「日本刀」的試騐機會正多着，鮫島并沒有到可以狂妄誇耀的時候。而且假如「刀」是萬能的話，那末「拿破崙的刀」呢？「威廉的刀」呢？何况「日本刀」還遠不及「拿破崙的刀」與「威廉的刀」之鋒利呢？　　然而，話說回頭，鮫島的話，却正是我們的一個最有價値的敎訓，這　訓即是「齒還齒，目還目，刀還刀！」不願嘗「日本刀滋味」的中國人，在這裏，應急起磨礪自己的「刀，」高呼：　　「鮫島看刀！」給雲裳  王婉容女士　　朋友：昨夜，有月光，洒在我床上，有秋雁，長鳴掠天空，在這種悽惶幽寂的情緖中，我想起了你！　　近年來神經受了刺激，簡直不大思索，更不願回想已往，朋友！不瞞你！這還是我四五年來第二次想到你呢。你的影子，在我的腦中，幾乎跟着時光溜走了。　　今年雙十節加家，不知怎麽高興起來，一個人走到母校去玩，穿過我們從前的敎室，走盡了那條長長的兩旁站着幾棵大槐樹的小徑，步上讀書臺前的石級。，讀書臺早已修理好了，依舊圍着竹叢，焦尾溪也是那般清澈明凈，我倚在竹篱旁，開始憶起你了，雲裳！一切還是依舊，不過我身旁少了你一個。　　你還記得我們並着肩抬頭望着竹叢外蔚藍色的碎光的一回事嗎？還有呢！我們摘了嫩竹葉，坐在石級上鬭草；大風中爬上敎室後的小山，走進那隻破舊的巫相寺，我們也曾爲了一些小事賭氣，你氣得伏在桌子上流淚，第二天又並肩在那條碎石舗成的小徑上喁喁細語了！雲裳！憑你怎樣健忘，我想也不至於忘了這幾幕！　　我自小生長在一個寂寞的家庭中，沒有和我一般大小的伴兒，父母只知道照顧我的衣食，却不會放風筝，更不會爬到樹頂上去偷鳥蛋，小孩子們所喜歡的游戲，他們都不會幹，所以我是寂寞，我是孤獨，在寂寞和孤獨的環境中，養成了我現在挹鬱的性格！　　在五六年前，我家搬進了城，在那年的榴花爘爛的夏天，我投考本地的縣立中學，你恰巧也進那個學校，讓我閉了雙目想吧！朋友！那天你不是穿　套黑白格了的麻紗衫褲麽？考試發表出來。你的國文得了第一，我是英文第一，於是我們開始認識了，起初大家還委害羞，開學兩星期後，我們已親熱得幾乎分不開了，再加先生們又時常稱贊你，於是同學們想盡了方法使你受窘，一年後，你終於退學了，起初我們還通着信，後來漸漸地疏遠了，終於彼此不知消息了！　　今年病了兩個多月，缺了好多功課，所以一起床趕着到從前一位英文先生處去補習，每天經過中山岸，一天清晨，我一手撑着紙傘，一手挾着書本回家，看見一個很可愛的孩子站在一家門口玩，依稀地認識他是你的外動；這就是你的家，『雲裳呢？』我問。他瞪着眼不響，這時裏面走出了你的母親，好邀我到你家客室裏，給我看你寫回來的信，信大概是這樣的意思：你告訴你的母親，說你已搬家了，新屋子很舒暢！你的永哥還買了架大留聲機，所以不覺得寂寞，··你還告訴你的母親，說後面園裏的玉蜀黍是你親手下的種，現在長得和小寳寳一般高了！高興時，你常攙了小寳寳到園子裏去拔草，你問你的母親能不能去嘗這果實？去看看好的外孫。那可愛的孩子··　　哦！雲裳！你已和你的表哥結婚了，並且已做了一個兩歲的孩子的母親了。生活很美滿甜蜜吧！不知當你携着小寳寳在後園散步的時候，可曾想到你少女時代的伴侣？　　從樹上飄下雨片黃葉，在一塊兒飛，現在一片已飄到了水面，跟着流水東去了，另一片還在飛，又要飛過高山，飄過大海去，飄零呀！永遠的飄零！　　向來孤傲惯了，當人家沒有想到我時，我是不願示弱，流露出思念的情緖來的！這封信不願寄給你，但是當你的小寳寳睡着了，一個人靜待你愛人歸來的深夜，無意中拿起報紙消遣，也許會看見這封信，雲裳！請閉上眼睛回想吧！前塵如夢，是温馨呢，還是凄然？　　你的朋友　十二，十二，二十一。蟻  金仲華　　紐約一家百貨公司的玩具部出賣活的蟻。在膠紙糊合的。片玻璃之間，一羣褐色的小東西與　地工作着。賣的人給這羣蟻一些沙，讓牠們轉灣抹角地移動着。在中央有一個特别大的，蟄伏着，差不多完全不動。那是蟻后，是其餘的工蟻所敬地供養着的。　　「牠們全不費手脚的，」賣的人說。「你祗要每月從這洞口放一滴蜜進去。祗要一滴，牠們就會自己運去分配的。」　　「一個月一滴？」一個年輕的婦人問。···「一滴能餵這些東西一個月麽？」　　她戴着一頂白草帽，穿着一身印花衣。一雙臂完全裸着。那賣物的，正是年輕的一個，熱心地望着她。　　「一滴就夠了，」他再說一遍。　　「這眞可愛」她說。　　她買了這透明的蟻山。　　×××　　「親愛的」，她說，「你看見我的蟻麽？」她用兩個纎細的指尖把這小玻璃匣子夾了起來。坐在她身旁的丈夫，正鑑賞着她頸部的曲線，　　「你把生活弄得多麽有趣味，親愛的，」他說。··「有了你，一切都新鮮，有變化。···昨夜，那音樂會：前天，阿特勒的演講：今天，這些蟻。··你想像不出我每晚回到家來是多麽的舒服···。」　　「看呵，親愛的，」她用一種他所歡喜的（好當然知道的）完全稚氣的口吻呌着，一你看見那大的蟻麽？那是蟻后。其餘的都侍候着牠。我自己餵牠們。你想一想。親愛的，一個月一滴蜜就夠了。···多麽詩意的！」　　他吻了她。　　×××　　一個星期後，她丈夫和朋友都把這蟻山看厭了。她也弄得有些厭倦。她把匣子放在她房中梳妝台的鏡子背後，不想再看見它。到一月底，她忘記了那一滴蜜。蟻都慢慢地餓死了。但到最後牠們還留一滴蜜給蟻事吃，牠是最後死去的一個。（譯ＡｎｄｒｅＭａｕａｒｏｓ作）紅葉  江天蔚　　滿野是紅葉。血似的紅。和那鉛色的田畝，蒼色的邱山相襯着。　　一個午後，太陽和暖的懸在西方的天空上，沒有風，他沒有雲，萬里青碧。我和中兩人無目的的在田塍上走着，一路盾紅葉。田上有些婦女和小孩在拔着馬料豆，專心一意的工作。目不旁瞬，有時却也唱着山歌。　　我和中已走到松溪的大堤上。只見一灣溪水，清碧的，淙淙的流着。兩條木橋，很瘦弱似的並立着，一二隻船揚帆着順着風，在山影間映現着，大堤兩旁，一面是枯黃的水楊，另一面是染着血似的紅葉，這樣輝映着是十分美麗的。　　中似乎凝想着什麽，一雙眼不轉睛的望着那高高的青天，他一定在懷念着遠人吧！我只是極目四望。城市裏慢慢的迷濛着炊烟，是快要黃昏了。中突然握住我的手，緊緊的，這是他和我第一次的緊張的握手。他沒有說話，像十分哀感。我說：　　「中，你爲什麽，又這樣的悲苦起來呢！」　　「我想到一個月友，他是和我頂要好的，他離開我已經三年了。」　　「他現在在地裏呢？有消息沒有呢？」　　「沒有消息的！他不會把他的惡劣的生活告訴我的。他是這人間的一個可憐人。他沒有親戚朋友，孤零零的飄泊，他··」　　中不說話了。他的眼眶裏滿含着酸苦的淚，假使這時候我再說一兩句較爲凄凉的話，中無論如何會弔下眼淚來的。我想說幾句安慰他的話，但我候不出該說什麽。　　中仔細的摘下一枝紅葉，對我說：　　「蔚，我把這紅葉寄到什麽地方去呢！」他掉下眼淚了，我默然不語。　　在回家的途中，兩個人都沒有話說，只見炊烟迷濛了一切。橡皮布的新發明  逢壬　　近數年來橡皮（Ｒｕｂｂｅｒ）的用途逐漸在推廣，現在牠已成爲工業上一種主要的原料了。除我們用以擦抹字跡，製造鞋底，車胎，皮帶以及建築馬路（在新加坡和船埠）在法國而外，最近在英國又發明了一種橡皮線是完全拿橡樹中的乳液（）製造的，牠不論在絲織（Ｓｉｄ）手織（Ｗｏｏｌ）或是棉織（Ｃｏｔｔｏｎ）物中，都可以用作緯線（Ｗｅｆｔ）來織成一種橡皮布。牠的伸縮性極大，如果把牠製成衣服，男女都可穿，並且保你不會生縐紋，然而在服式上應該摺疊的處所，縫製時也可使牠摺疊的，至於牠的質地，也很堅牢，任你怎樣去洗或熨，總不致於破裂的。所以據發明人說，用這種布做的衣服比較用其他任何織物做的衣服，總可耐穿四五年　　普通一般的衣服，到了黃霉時節，如果不拿到太陽光中曬過，就要霉得不成樣子。但是這種橡皮布做的衣服，是可以抵禦濕氣和熱度的，所以不必有晒霉之勞。並且因爲牠本質富有伸縮性的緣故，衣服尺寸做得小些也無碍大體，反正牠能自動的伸張的！　　英國紡織業中，對於這種新發明的協約，差不多已經完成了。假使他們都能順利的去進行，那末現在蘭開夏（Ｌａｎｃａｓｈｉｒｅ）和郁克夏（Ｙｏｒｋｓｈｉｒｅ）兩龜停歇已久的許多紡織機，又可開車了。不久之前，這種橡皮線，剛傳入美國的時候，極受人歡迎，在最初一星期内，竟售去八○○，○○○餘金鎊，雖然有許多工廠，一天開足了二十四小時的工作，竭力去製造，可是出品還不足適應社會上一般的需要。現在聽說美國已有一家巨大的橡皮公司，正在和歐洲幾家商店協商辦法，預科在數星期後，當可就緖，那末以後歐洲的紡織業必然的要起一次劇變了。長篇創作時代与愛的歧路十五  張資平　　她立在他的房門口，不就進來。　　「······」　　「啊呀！爲什麽？」　　好笑着走進來，立在他的身傍，故意屈了屈身腰，從下面望了望海泉的臉。「發脾氣了，林先生？」　　他此刻不能不笑了。　　「今晚上吃夜飯的時候，有兩個月友來看你喲，一男一女。」　　「誰？」　　聽見有人來找他，他忙着問。　　「留有名片。」　　她把揑在手裏的一張名片交給他了。他看了後，知道是張應奎和卓女士。他覺得是錯過了一個好機會的樣子。　　「滿漂亮的姑娘，同學麽？」　　海泉只點了點頭。　　「對不住，我還有一點事。·····」　　鶴子夫人的態度和平時不相同，她又怱怱的出去，走向曾先生的書房那一頭去了。海泉又氣惱了。本想問她來客走了沒有的，此則只好忍耐着不問了。　　當鶴子夫人下扶梯時，他便　把自己的房門使勁的一推，碎的一聲，閂住了。這是他向她的示威運動。至於鶴子夫人聽見後表示怎樣的態度，他是無從知道了。　　他今晚上要自己翻并被窩來鑽進去睡了。平時是鶴子夫人替他把被窩攤好了後，便說一聲「請早點休息」，才走下二樓去的。　　　睡進被窩裏後，學得雙脚像冰塊一樣，但是被窩比他的脚更冷，他只縮着雙脚，在被窩裏打抖。　　㈧　　「的啄，的啄，支那雲吞麵！」　　在這一帶住有不少的東洋人。中國人賣麵的知道東洋人喜歡吃中國麵担起麵担子，常走到這弄堂裏來，倣着日本的口音，呌賣支那雲吞麵聽見便把頭藏進被窩裏，不高興聽，　　「自己還搬過地方來住，不要住在這鬼窟裏了。」　　他雖然這樣想，但是仍沒有十足的勇氣離開鶴子夫人。　　「雲吞麵！」　　這明明是鶴子夫人的聲音。海泉剛才平落下去了的氣，又重新湧了起來。</p>

<p>談言血的遊戲  吾　　我們常有這種機會：看見兩羣不同種類的螞蟻·爲了一塊還有最後一滴油的鹹肉骨頭，受着蟻王的命令而互相肉摶，死的死，傷的傷，最後有誰伸出粗毛大腿，將這一羣不分皂白的踏死，於是嗚呼哀哉，大家同歸於盡，結果這一塊瘦得可憐的骨頭給强有力者　去給狗吃。閒言少提，且歸正傳，　　自十一月十六日清晨至二十四日止，田劉兩位英雄率領士兵在成都巷戰肉摶七十三次，戰線展開五十餘里。二十九軍方面除死亡團營連排長三百六十　　　　　　　　　八員外，士兵死亡五千四百餘名。二十四軍死同上之官長四百四十九員外，士兵計七千八百餘人。二十八軍死官兵共八百餘名。共計死亡一萬五千餘名。　　　！眞是一塲血戰。只殺得血流成河屍骨堆山。假如這些死亡者的父母妻子都同時哭着來戰塲收屍的話，那末這哭聲的匯合，我想一定洪亮得可以吧。　　至於衆方面，也死得大有可觀：妓女六千餘人，學生一千六百餘人，其他市民八千餘人。於是我們在耳邊可以模糊的聽着。：丈夫哭着妻子，兒女哭着父母，妻子哭着丈夫，父母哭着兒女。她哭着他，他又哭着她。哼！從此哭聲震天，人世界變成鬼世界了。　　呀！多麽好的成績喲，繁華市街化爲焦土，文化機關摧毁殆盡。這種空前浩刧，在我情的仁兄看來，不免同聲一哭，可是在田劉鄧三位大元帥看來，却將嘴角一歪，從鼻孔裏哼出一絲笑意，「算得什麽，不過又是一塲遊戲了。」　　這種遊戲昨天玩過了，今天再玩，明天還可再玩，。···决不會厭煩的。　　直到幾雙長毛的外國大腿伸來。不分皂白的像踏着螞蟻一樣，而且將這一塊地盤拿去這時候我們的元帥乍樣呢？不成問題當然仍可做亡國大夫，因爲他們究竟比蟻王來得聰明，而該死的只有我們這些窮朋友罷了。</p>

<p>常識口琴  宙　　口琴是西洋樂器之一種，因牠的形式小巧，携帶便利，發童雅悅，學習簡易，和裝置完全，那就被一般所注意了，可以獨奏，二重奏，三重奏，以至於許許多多人合奏的口琴隊，現在特地把牠的種類，構造，衛生三項，寫在下面，　　種類口琴的名稱多至千數種，就各廠家出品之不同，名稱亦隨之各别了，基本的可分作單音口琴，複童口琴，重童口琴，和半音口琴四種，還有穴空的多寡分十空十二空十四空以至廿四空等口琴，因爲沒有半音的設備，有Ａ調Ｂ調Ｃ調盡至嬰Ａ變Ｅ等之差異，普通以Ｃ調廿空複音口琴爲最合用，可以吹單音、複音（伴奏），和音，震音，顫音，琶音等各種奏法，但是沒有半音之裝置，必要的時候，還特配上一只半音口琴，上下移動吹奏那就不很易吹奏了，尤其在快捷之樂譜中，更感困難，幸而半音在樂譜中，不常發見，並不動搖牠底價値，構造，現在把普通的標準的廿空複音口琴來　　、這種口音，横分二十空，中間用木片隔分上下二格，使擴大聲浪，置同音簧二枚，從左到右，分低音中音高音三組，爲能奏旋律和伴奏起見，所以１２５都是吹的２４６７都是吸的，爲調節呼吸起見，所以吹吸互隔，因此音階也就參雜了，牠的排列１２３６５７１２３４５６１７３２５４１６，内中省去了不常用的４７却巧成爲二十音，中音比較整齊些，因爲最易用到的，　　衛生　吹口琴是弊多利少的，因爲牠是吹吸的樂器，直接影響到呼吸器管丨口，喉，肺，丨的緣故，㈠不規則的吸吹（長，促，響，低），肺部受了猛烈的剌激，所以有肺病及心臟病頭暈體弱者，絶對不能吹，强健者每日也不得過一小時的吹奏，否則就現出頭昏目暈等反應，㈡音簧由銅製成，氧化銅丨銅綠丨有極毒的，吸入肺内爲害非淺，㈢有病時將病菌吹入琴内，病愈後再從琴内吸入體内，循環傳染着，豈不糟了嗎，所以要常時用酒精消毒，不可借用，㈣口琴有許多空穴，很容易儲藏塵穢　不單損壞口琴本身，還要吸入喉腔，所以要收藏在小匣或小袋内，並須不時洗刷清凈，吹前宜嗽口，㈤吹時將口琴　　移動，便要擦傷了口欠，有碍美觀，可用凡士林搽抹，免致遺爛或疼疼痛，同時需停止吹奏，說說笑笑  怡·怡·館·主　　某甲的霋，潑悍異常，所以鄰居戚友間，平時都呌他做「雌老虎」。一天，她忽然病了，於是她的丈夫丨丨某甲，忙着呌他的兒子，去請醫生。豈知他的兒子，一時纒錯的，竟請了個獸醫來。那獸醫瞧見是某甲的妻患病，於是很奇怪的問某甲道：「咦！尊夫人非驢非馬，爲什麽請我這個獸醫來呢」？某甲聴了，也很奇怪，於是問他的兒子道：「咦！你母親非驢非馬，爲什麽請了這個獸醫」？他的兒子答道：「母親雖則非驢非馬，然而，却是一隻出名的「雌老虎」哩！」當時這話不留神，給他的母親聽得了，於是他的母親在牀上，便像獅子般的怒吼起來，直撲好的兒子，她的兒子竟嚇的極呌道：「母親不但是一隻出名的「雌老虎」，並且還是一隻凶猛的「獅子」啊！店員通訊　　貴刋載周良驥君第五個問題：「站在一個店員，工友與學徒的地位，如何可以盡中華民國一份子的義務，幹抗日救國的工作？」徵求讀者意見：我想這是我們自身的問題，應當討論的，今我大膽貢獻　點淺陋的見角、不知値得大家　國的同志們一顧否？　　欲解决中國目前的困難，最痛快的工具，曰「血」與「鐵」，現在我們所缺乏的，就是百折不撓的「鐵血精神」。但在未曾充分準備以前，是不可輕易冒險：所以現在第一件事，就是民族整個的憬悟　捐棄私見，放大眼光。有財產的供給財產，有智慧的供給智慧，有勞力的供給勞力；聚全國力量，抱絶大犧牲，積極準備，祗要人心不死，日久不衰的繼續努力，斷沒有不能達到目的。　　我們一個職工，所處地位雖低，所負使命却不小，因爲我們有天賦予智慧勞力　比較什麽都寳貴，正可以擴充其效能，來進行我們的工作。我們職業餘暇，要熱心運動，多讀書籍，成功一個精神飽滿，體力强壯，人格高尙，知識豐富的健全國民，要忠實服務，加緊工作，使生產增加，事業發展，間接培養國力，直接有益自身；不要受人利用，　　　浪，動輒罷工，　　　生活　　託的事業，發生停頓，不　自討苦吃，且被數人冷笑。　　日用所需，務必採購國貨，拒用劣貨，交詔其予，兄勉其弟　人人心目中存一個抵制的决心，實足以　敵人於死地，不正當的娱樂，不良的嗜好，在在使民族基本份子的有爲青年，受其誘惑，陷溺不救，馴至身敗名裂，致社會多一個墮落者，實爲戕傷國脈的最大原因。我們自己應該小心，立志擯絶。　　我們做小職工的，出息旣微，負担重的，就無法維持。這責任完全在做資方的善爲體恤，使無内顧憂，方可提高能率，增進工作；但有一部份人負担本來不重，往往辛苦所得，快活用去，極易養成浪費的習慣。此事似乎與本題無關。須知個人經濟方面不能獨立，則救已不遑，何睱救國？所以個人必須定一個預算，務使收支適合··如能有餘，積少成多，養成儲蓄習慣，亦是培養國富的一法。　　以上所談，都是平淡無奇，人人可做的，大家何不來努力一下啦！　　孫贊堯十二·十二·店員通訊欄簡章　　　　（一）通訊宗旨　本欄以集思廣益，解釋疑難問題，相互切磨，增進生活之幸福爲宗旨。　　（二）通訊對象　本欄之對象，就人言，祗以店員學徒爲限，就地言，祗以本埠爲限。　　（三）通訊内容　凡一切關於個人日常生活如：　　㈠職業㈡道德與學問上之修養㈢娛樂與運動㈣婚姻，以及其他旁及國家社會之問題，均所歡迎。如遇問題内容過於深奥而非本欄能力所及者，亦可介紹至本報「讀者顧問·代爲解答之。　　（四）來信方式　　（一）信末須寫明姓名，年齡，籍貫，職業及詳細通訊處等項，繼續來信時仍須寫明。　　（二）來信文體不拘，惟以簡明易解爲主，並須繕寫清楚。　　（三）信面請寫明申報館本埠增刋店員通訊欄收字樣：如需回信，則請附郵票二分。　　（四）通訊者須將本欄所特刋之印花剪下，黏貼來信之左上角，不貼，恕不作答。　　（五）收到來信後之處理方法　　（一）凡所討論之問題，本報認爲有貢獻大衆之價値者，得在報端披露之。　　（二）爲尊重通訊者之意見，凡來信如聲明不願披露姓名，或須單獨答復，亦可照辦。　　（三）如通訊者希望將來信披露於報端，而因篇幅過長·不能全文披露時，當擇要刋登。又如問題内容複雜，不得不加以愼重研究，以致遲遲作答或披露時，務希鑒諒。（四）遇有來信擁擠時，當按照來信之先後次第作答，或有稽延，亦希鑒諒小說寫信給友人之妻（七續）  秦瘦鷗　　嫖的同道當然是多多益善。他們對於我的動請求入夥，個個都表示着極度的歡迎「我給你先代一個局吧！」「我介紹你一個好姑娘吧！「我···！」大家齊像落水鬼討替一般的熱心地，紛紛拖我下水。其實我原爲下水而來，原爲自甘堕落而來，他們縱不拖我，我也必絶不遲疑地自動躍入咧！　　所苦的，身子雖然下了水，却並不能像以前一般地覺得沉醉，舒適，迷戀，陶融···反覺得每一個女人都是假得可恨，蠢得可憐。我雖竭力的在追求歡樂，無奈所得的歡樂，純粹是極淺薄的，極虚僞的：不但不能使我顚倒得神智昏迷，以致於完全把你忘却，結果反使我越發的想得你厲害。啊！小猪玀！你的魔力是多麽的偉大啊　！　　女人，歌唱，白蘭地，鴉片烟，有閒階級的一切享樂，對於我竟一些不生效力：我雖是不分晝夜的在那裏和他們周旋着，可恨那一顆倔强的心，却老是飛出了腔，儘在平安里十號的屋頂上盤旋着。　　這樣無聊而苦悶的生活，把我壓榨得氣都回不過來了。精神是一天一天的消沉了　滿腔鬱之火。却加倍有力的燃燒着；腦神經亂得像斷絲一般，往往在十點鐘上了床，眼睜睜地一直望到天亮。情形愈變愈惡，後來畢竟是不能忍耐了，我於是又在你的左右出現了。僅只你的一笑，已把我一個多月來的愁緖，全部吹散了。　　唉丨哦沒有話了，惟有　　而　服。　　第二次是在去年十二月的初，我也是突然的受了一個刺激而走的。不過這一件事的經過很繁雜，要重複的講，委實是太宂長了；好在，聰明的小月友！你祗須在你們那一位黝黑而短小的令姊　　　　　　　便可以知道我所受的是怎樣的一個剌激了！　　現在就讓我告訴你，那四　　　　　　　我究竟在那裏呢。說實話：我不是在杭州，而是在蘇州，在蘇　　　　　　　　　。我　　　　你親，有妻子，有女兒　他們者像　臣孝子一　　　　　　　　　　　：因此我就打算利用這一些天倫之樂，來　　我對於你的迷戀。　　起初的幾天，果然有幾分　　　　　　　　　　　　　　更　之際，村大的吠聲，驚醒了我的好夢　　由我不　想對　　　　的表形之外，别的時候，我居然可以暫時把你忘掉，這種偉大的精神的促成，大半倒出自我的女兒丨惠明的力量。　　她有一條短而壯健的身子，一雙大得超過了口腔的横度的大眸子，兩個淺淺的酒渦，一個扁平的鼻子，在别人的目光中看來，好是並不怎樣美麗的：不過我看好却是出奇的可愛，比任何人家的孩子都好丨她是長得多麽活潑可愛啊！而且她很會說話，親愛的小兄弟，好簡直和你一般的會說話。我在家裏的最初的十天工夫，差不多整天和她纏在一起：　居然也有這樣的一些小魔力，倒不是我始料所及的！小月友！將來你也許可以見到好。我希望你，我請求你，丨這是我對於你唯一的請求，丨當好像你自己的小薔薇一般的照料好，掖護好。看在我的面上！　　半個月的工夫，很平穏地在青山綠水之中銷滅過去了。漸漸地，我又感覺到孤獨的苦悶了。孤獨，這是什麽話？光是自己家裏，就有父母，妻女，兄弟，姊妹十來個人，整天伴着我，怎麽還說是孤獨呢？然而他們之於我。都不過像一件點綴品，或是玩物而已：世界上配和我談笑的，就祇你一個人！縱有幾十，或幾百個人日夜輪流着伴我，說笑，我還是感你到孤獨，苦悶。因爲他們的話，都是我所不愛聽的：惟有你所說的話，却句句新頴百雋永，不但好聽，而且還値得回味！</p>

<p>電影專刊海外珍聞好萊塢的郵務員（上）  光毅　　好萊塢的郵務員可算得是世界上最受麻煩的郵務員了。影迷們寫給好萊塢明星們的信，每日都是如雪片般紛來。那些信面上很多不寫收信者的姓名和住址的，他們都常用些奇曲古怪的圖畫或字樣來表示他們要寄給的明星·假是那些郵務員不是常與電影接觸的話，那眞不知每年有多少信要無法投遞而被抛到火㷔中燒毁呢。　　但是，好萊塢的郵務員都是聰明幹練的。他們常能從不具收信人姓名住址的信面上的奇特古怪的東西上，領會出影迷們要寄給的明星，將他們的信遞給他或她。　　譬如在從前，有一個影迷，寫了一封信到好萊塢，他也不寫明收信人的姓名和住址，僅在信面上畫一隻狗，結果，當這封信到好萊塢以後，聰明的郵務員就無疑地將它送給李鄧肯ＬｅｅＤｕｎｓａｎ那已故狗明星的豢主。　　還有一次一封信面上只畫了一個笑臉，其餘寫了一行ＧｏｏｄＫｎｏｗｓＷｈｅｒｅ本雪文尼亞洲的郵務員接到這樣的一封信，立刻就將它寄到好萊塢而轉給亞爾喬生ＡｌＪｏｌｓｏｎ。瓊白朗黛爾ＪｏａｎＢｌｏｎｄｅｌｌ有迷人的倩笑，有可愛的藍睛。多少青年都以她訂友爲榮。她很少接見訪問者。牠正在拍一齣戀愛劇「中央公園」ＣｅｎｔｒａａＰａｒｋ。　　影片談評舊戀新歡  燕南　　近來柯倫比亞公司，搜羅的明星眞不少，出亦也的確有進步，卡爾登昨日起演的「舊戀新歡」ＭａｎｉｎＨｅｒＬｉｆｅ，就是很好的證據丨　　本事是述一個四角纞愛，丨三個男子都追逐一個女性，丨當然經了相當的波折，一雙情侣的樓抱，團圓了事，　　主角洛絲瑪倫ＬｏｉｓＭｏｒａｎ就飾這個博愛主義受三人追求的女子，她十足表露出來，近來摩登女性的缺憾，大致是很好，似乎在法院内的一幕，表演不大夠！　　第一個男子，是却利比克福ＣｈａｒｌｅｓＢｉｃｆｏｒｄ扮的，一種雄偉的氣概，忠懇的態度，可以說現代男子的模典，第二個男子，（維克多伐康尼ＶｉｃｔｏｒＶａｒｃｏｎｉ）飾是代表一種虚僞欺詐的男子，冷凈陰險的表情，呌人生「敬而遠之」的心第三個男子，（是唐那狄羅韋ＤｏｎａｌｄＤｉｌｌｏｗａｙ作的，）除對白可取外，很少表演，　　這三個男子，個性顯然是不同的，第一個是成功了，第二個被殺了，第三個可以算「花花公子」之流，本來不在乎一個女子的得失，不過事實上他是失敗的，　　導演很機警，知道怎麽樣容易討好，就避難就易，不過有地方的小穿挿和描寫，都還可以看，他用那兩位法國演員，來襯托巴黎，可以算很得法，在法院中一幕的緊張，完全被飾律師和檢查官的兩位，佔了所有的精彩，使主角反冷淡下去，未免太疏忽，不過那兩位的對話，也眞有力，丨是很生色的配角，丨全片還算緊張，結構也不鬆弛，　　片中在駡一般不知戀愛眞諦和不知世故的女子，駡得很娓宛，寫商賈小人的勢利眼，也淋漓盡致，攝影光線均屬上乘　　一個人是兇手，丨殺死了人的人丨在任何可原諒的條件下，也不是這麽容易被釋的，這一點劇情，似乎可商榷，　　還有，劇中一切的一切，都在對白中說出，未免有枯燥之譏，這樣使很能表演的演員，少了許多施展本領的機會　　無論如何，牠總還是一部不錯的片子，新片預告桃樂絲得里奥的「樂園之鳥」  瑞英　　在好萊塢，去年體美考試得第一的，富有西班牙風味的女明星桃樂絲得里奥，只要領略過她主演的片子如「復活」「復仇」「壞坯子」、··等，立刻會感覺到好的表情是如何的「灼熱」啊！實在的，桃樂絲得里奥的表現的技巧是超過好萊塢的一切的女明星。無論是神秘的嘉寳，甜的南錫卡洛，熱的克萊拉寳，豔的麥唐娜，美的珍妮蓋諾，但是他們表情的骨子，那能及得來桃樂絲得里奥的深刻而沉重的打動着觀衆的心，使得青年男女們不得不去拜倒好的裙下啊！　　現在，好消息來了，千呼萬喚之「樂園之島」聞現已攝竣，這張影片的成功是不容易的，聞說得里奥留在南國的夏威夷島有半年之久，幸而一般土夫都和她要好，待好好似皇后一樣的，得里奥在那南國的美麗風光之下，對着靜穆的月夜，搖曳的棕樹···發揮着好的動人底熱力，我們知道，一定會較她以前所演的片子更爲深刻。影星小史希佛來的略歷  吻濤　　希佛萊是現代明星中，最負盛名，最受人歡迎的一個，他的動作，表情，以及一切的一切，最迎合於近今時代潮流之下，最適合於一般摩登姑娘，摩登大少的心理，他所以受人歡迎的特徵，便是他獨有的歌唱，像「璇宫艶史」。「紅樓艶史」，「巴黎一侍」者」幾片中，他完全持歌唱以爲重心，而極端的博得人們的歐迎，　　希佛萊是個法國人，他的父親是個漆匠，他有一位哥哥也是漆匠，所以他們的家境是非常貧困，他們的開支時有不足之虞，他七歲時，他的父親勉强積了些錢送他上小學校裏去讀書，可是不多幾時爲了他太頑皮了，並且他喜歡的歌唱，不論在上課時也時常會唱歌的，因此便給學校開除了出來，於是也從此輟學了，十一歲時，不幸他的父親又死了，他的家境更拮据了，他的哥哥才也呌他去漆匠店當學徒，後來又給店主辭歇了，這時他索性努力學習歌唱哩，他天生的聰明，所以不到二年便成功了，終於在一個小咖啡店當了奏唱者，不久，忽爲一個無臺裏看上了他，請他上舞臺演戲，還答應他簽一張二年的合同，每星期的酬勞是五法郎，後來增至八個法郎，因此他的奏唱引起了興奮，而努力地漸漸進步了，這時他名望也響了，他也略微有些錢了，藉此機會他脫離了舞臺，開了一所藥房，可是生意不佳，也就此關閉了，於是便再圖重上舞臺表演，不久他竟會碰到了當院頂著名女伶密倫裘，自願請求他合唱，幾次後，至此，他的聲譽才名溢全國了，最後，他又决到好萊塢去當演員，才加入了拍拉蒙公司攝片，沒有幾時，居然又給他在銀壇上得了比舞臺上更大的名譽，眞是僥倖極了，讀者意見給三個影片公司的一個貢獻  陸亞生　　明星，天一，聯華，三大影片公司，所攝成的過去影片，各有各的好和壞，已見諸報載，在下並不是來捧場，也不是來毁壞。　　在現代的商業競戰中，影片當然不能例外，但是；吾人時常在報上看見巨幅的影片廣告，然而；等到看過了這部影片以後，心裏頭很覺得懊喪似的，那是也很多的，現在我所要貢獻的，便是丨假使三公司要發揚國產影片的話，在一年之中三公司擬聯合起來，舉行二次或四次的聯合影片，把整個的精神，統統放在這一張片子上，到那個時候，我想，觀衆的心理，也一定十二分的滿意，國產片的復興，並不是一椿難事。　　往往有幾種影片劇本很好，角色配得不對，有的是；劇本不十分好，角色是很好的，這就是一個例子，以上不過是在下的一個小貢獻，我曾研究過戲劇和電影，我用着十二萬分的盼望，假使三公司眞的能夠聯合起來實行，國產片定有復興的一日，　　女明星的綽號史斌　　宣景琳···小老太婆　　王漢倫···鳳陽婆　　韓雲珍···騷姐姐　　夏佩珍···鄉下姑娘　　黎明暉···小妹妹　　徐琴芳···老闆娘　　鄔麗珠···女范朋克來函照登　　申報電影專刋編者先生今日貴刋「咱們的小生補遺」中關於王元龍一條，中有「辦大中華影片公司」云云，全非事實，查張織雲黎明暉王元龍均爲當年大中華所請之演員云，六合影片公司則爲明星大中華神州民新上海友聯等六家影片公司所合組之營業機關，玉潔氷清爲民新出品，與王君均絶無關係，凡稍知中國電影者，都能道之，希更正爲荷，隨便談談「咱們的小生」補遺（下）介　　王次龍：和王元龍是難兄難弟，大中華時代他也是熱可炙手的人物小生老生都來得。表演很好，導演手腕也不弱。去年脫離聯華，今年跟了王龍元也入了聯華了，他的傑作是「義雁情鴛」王春元；是一九三二年新起的明星。聯華提携他。呌他代替高占非的地位。已經有幾部出品，成績差强人意，人也算漂亮。　陳秋風；他是文明戲旦角出身，資格老得很。前年去了一次日本，拍了一部「雨過天青」。因爲是中國第一部有聲片，所以輿論不錯。他加入大華影片公司　　林雪懷：他在五六年前主演「秋扇怨」，成績不錯。他很有學問，人才和朱飛差不多。他靠了胡蝶婚姻案，哄動了一時。同時他努力於商業「雪懷照像室」，就是他開的，不過他現在又有重登影台的消息了。　　高威廉：許多人不知道他，他是十年前老角色，留學好萊塢的僅有者。他給巴利穆亞作過配角，新近回國來。他很合健美的條件。表演是有「心得」於美國的。化裝術是他唯一的技能。現在聯華服務，如果給他機會前途是很遠大的。　　王吉亭；他的滑頭小生，是著名的。他的黃金時代是與楊耐梅並時的。從前他朝秦暮楚的作過一影片公司巡閱使」最近他却能安分守已的在明星作了七八年。比較起來，他比鄭小秋高明得多了。　　王斌：是最新的人了，他是中國大學生加入影界第一人。「故宫新怨」的失敗，他並沒失敗。他有藝術本能。等待好導演來應用罷了。　　當然我仍是掛一漏萬，不過本着提倡國片的希望來作一個片段介紹而已。　　還有一點敢買獻湯神君：就是朱飛已和聯合公司訂合同，不久在銀幕可以看見了。（完）　　啓事　徐培仁君鑒：大函誦悉。暫時不需長稿。將來缺乏時再當函商。編者</p>

<h3>League of Nations Subcommittee Secretly Drafts Conciliation Plan</h3>
<p>Reaffirm the March 11th resolution, invite China, Japan, the United States, and Russia to participate, advocate adopting Chapters 9 and 10 of the Lytton Report in the conciliation process, and a declaration may reiterate the principle of non-recognition of the "Manchukuo" puppet regime.</p>
<h3>Seeking Opinions from Both China and Japan</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen has entrusted British representative Simon, Spanish representative Madariaga, French representative Massigli, Swiss representative Huber, and Czech representative Písecký to form a five-member drafting committee to quickly formulate a draft to attempt to conciliate the Sino-Japanese dispute. This drafting committee's work is almost complete. When the last meeting is held tomorrow at noon, the wording of the draft will certainly be finalized. Although the committee is strictly keeping the content of the draft secret, those who have already read the draft have a good impression. It is generally believed that the Committee of Nineteen can meet on Thursday, and the League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly will be convened on Friday or Saturday. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The subcommittee of five representatives from Britain, France, Switzerland, Spain, and Czechoslovakia met this afternoon in an extremely secretive atmosphere for two and a half hours. After the five representatives left the meeting room, they all said they must maintain confidentiality and cannot reveal the content of the discussion. All they could tell people was that the work was not finished and they would have to meet again tomorrow afternoon. However, there is reason to believe that the subcommittee has tentatively agreed on a draft proposal after discussion, and will seek the opinions of the two parties involved on whether they can accept it. It is rumored that the proposed proposal will mention the Lytton Report. Although it does not practically accept the first eight chapters of the report, it will advocate using these eight chapters as the basis for conciliation work.</p>
<p>It is now heard that the five-nation subcommittee has agreed on the text of its proposal and report. If no unexpected events occur when the second meeting is held tomorrow afternoon, this proposal and report can probably be submitted to the Committee of Nineteen tomorrow afternoon. It is heard that the proposal reaffirms the resolution of March 11 and suggests inviting the United States and Russia to participate. In addition to the proposal, there is another report mentioning the Lytton Report and advocating adopting the ninth and tenth chapters of the Lytton Report in the conciliation process. It is believed that a plan based on the above outline can be accepted by all parties. The subcommittee adjourned at 5:50 PM, with the work unfinished and to be discussed again tomorrow. (Reuters dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The subcommittee organized by the Committee of Nineteen to draft a resolution on the Sino-Japanese dispute for submission to the League of Nations Assembly has decided on the content of the resolution today, emphasizing the urgent need to implement de-escalation efforts between China and Japan. The resolution also suggests organizing a committee of twenty-three nations, combining the current nineteen nations, plus China, Japan, Soviet Russia, and the United States. However, the United States and Russia have not yet expressed their willingness to join the committee, and Washington has hinted that the United States' cooperation depends on whether the League of Nations Assembly can unconditionally decide not to recognize "Manchukuo" as a country. (National News Agency dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is just heard that the draft investigation report resolution and declaration drafted by the subcommittee of the Committee of Nineteen have been agreed to by other members of the Committee of Nineteen, and are expected to be drafted completely today. It is anticipated that the investigation report will suggest that the League of Nations Assembly pass the first eight chapters of the Lytton Report as the basis for proceeding with this case. The resolution will support the organization of a conciliation committee and invite the United States and Russia to join. As for the declaration, it may reiterate the principle of not recognizing the "Manchukuo" puppet regime. (National News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the United States' participation in the discussion, the committee is also fully aware that the United States initially did not pay attention to how the Lytton Report was handled, only deeply believing that the League of Nations should take a stance that is even more advanced than the United States' previous stance on "Manchukuo." It is anticipated that the United States will wait until the League of Nations takes this stance before it is willing to join the discussion. As for Soviet Russia, the committee also knows that Soviet Russia's participation in the discussion will depend on what kind of exchange each country can give. Its foreign affairs commissioner Litvinov said here that ten of the nineteen committee member countries have not yet recognized Soviet Russia. If Soviet Russia rashly joins the discussion, will it not be in a ridiculous position? And if the United States participates, there will be eleven more countries that have not yet recognized Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Although, there are currently several committee members who hope that a concrete resolution can be put forward for discussion tomorrow. Secretary-General Drummond also said that he believes the League of Nations Assembly can pass a resolution on Friday and adjourn until mid-January. (National News Agency dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Will Change its Policy After Sino-Russian Resumption of Relations, If the Puppet State of Manchukuo is not Clearly Denied, The United States and Russia Will Reject Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the international situation will change after the resumption of Sino-Russian relations. Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, the League of Nations must also change its policy. The Committee of Nineteen originally intended to invite the United States and Russia to participate in organizing a conciliation committee, but the United States and Russia refused to participate because the League of Nations' current attitude does not meet their respective positions. It is expected that if the League of Nations does not make a clear resolution on the factual part of the Lytton Report and the non-recognition of "Manchukuo," the United States and Russia will refuse to cooperate, and the League of Nations will be in a dilemma in resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute.

<h3>Japan Conditionally Acknowledges the Conciliation Committee Proposal</h3>
<p>Cabinet Decides on Four Principles</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British Ambassador to Japan, Lindsay, persuaded Foreign Minister Uchida to recognize the conciliation committee. Yesterday, the cabinet discussed Japan's attitude towards the conciliation committee. As a result, it was decided to adhere to the established policy. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Foreign Minister Uchida invited the British Ambassador to the Foreign Ministry to explain the government's principled attitude, roughly saying that the Japanese government would not oppose the establishment of a conciliation committee if it did not conflict with the established policy of resolving the Manchurian issue with the independence of Manchuria. However, the powers of the committee and the qualifications of the United States and Russia to participate are still unclear, so it is regrettable that a definite answer of approval or disapproval cannot be given. He also requested the British Ambassador's understanding, and after the meeting, he immediately telegraphed this intention to Matsuoka, the representative in Geneva. (Domei News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the conciliation committee proposal put forward by representative Simon, Foreign Minister Uchida consulted with the heads of the Foreign Ministry and the military authorities. As a result, the principled attitude of the Japanese government was decided and passed at yesterday's regular cabinet meeting. This principle was immediately telegraphed to Chief Representative Matsuoka. The principles decided by Japan are divided into four items as follows: 1. The Japanese government believes that the only solution to the Manchurian issue is to recognize the independence of "Manchukuo" and absolutely opposes applying Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. If this is disregarded, the Japanese government will in principle oppose any conciliation measures. 2. The powers and organization of the conciliation committee can be tacitly approved if they do not conflict with this principle. Japan will not submit a counterproposal on this. 3. It is still unclear in what capacity non-League of Nations members the United States and Russia are invited. The Japanese government believes that there is no need to express approval or disapproval, but in principle opposes inviting the United States and Russia. 4. It is rumored that the conciliation committee will order the participation of the two parties involved, China and Japan. The Japanese government has always had the principle that if the conciliation committee does not exclude the Manchurian issue, then the resolution of the Manchurian issue rejects the intervention of third countries, so the Japanese government will not participate.

<h3>Japanese Delegation Holds Meeting to Study Countermeasures</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Geneva dispatch, the Japanese delegation held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 13th and did not disperse until about 1:00 PM in the afternoon. It is heard that the most important thing that the Japanese delegation is currently focusing on is the League of Nations' plan to persuade the two parties involved, China and Japan. Japan has always absolutely opposed the interference of third countries, so if both China and Japan participate in the majority of countries, the result will be that the role of foreign opinions is stronger than the opinions of the parties involved, and it will in fact become interference by other countries. Therefore, Japan opposes this plan. The representative country intends to hold another meeting to study countermeasures and then apply for instructions from its own country. (Japan United Press dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese delegation in Geneva held a representative meeting at 11:15 PM last night to discuss the issue of participating in the conciliation committee. The opinions of the Japanese representatives were divided into two types. One said that if they participate, they are afraid of being restrained unknowingly, and the claim to exclude third countries from participating in the League of Nations' strategy cannot be maintained. The other said that the Japanese government's policy has been decided, and if the situation is unfavorable to Japan, the original strategy can be re-implemented without any loss. After careful discussion, it was decided to participate. Matsuoka has already requested instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Japanese representative in Geneva visited representatives from various countries separately to explain in detail Japan's claim that Sino-Japanese disputes should be negotiated directly between China and Japan and should not allow the participation of third countries, and earnestly requested the pardon of various countries. (China United Press dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<h3>Regarding the Shanhaiguan Conflict, the Japanese Delegation Sent a Letter to the League of Nations, Claiming that Our Army Apologized to Them</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Representative Oka of the Japanese delegation sent a letter to the Secretariat of the League of Nations regarding the recent Sino-Japanese military conflict near the Great Wall, claiming that on December 10, the Chinese army commander in Shanhaiguan reached a compromise agreement with the Japanese military authorities, acknowledging that the Chinese side fired the first shot and specifically apologized to the Japanese side, and promised to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing still disregarded the facts and protested to the Japanese ambassador to China on December 11. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Simon Hastens Back to London</h3>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Minister Simon is scheduled to return to London tonight, with Duke of Kent replacing him as the representative to the Committee of Nineteen. The five-member drafting committee is scheduled to meet at 3:30 PM this afternoon. It is now anticipated that the League of Nations Assembly will be held on Saturday or Sunday. It is heard that Simon's return to his country is related to the failure of the French Cabinet. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Issues Statement on the Resumption of Sino-Russian Relations</h3>
<p>"The path of free exchange between the two nations has cleared obstacles, and it is deeply believed that it will greatly contribute to the realization of peace in the Far East."</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, acting President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen told a reporter from the Kuomin News Agency, "I am extremely satisfied with the resumption of formal diplomatic and commercial relations between China and Russia. I have always believed that between the two great systems of humanism representing the Chinese and Russian nations, there is a natural sympathy that is sufficient to overcome the illusions of international politics. I am very happy to see that the path of free exchange between the two nations has now cleared all obstacles, and I deeply believe that it will greatly contribute to the realization of peace in the Far East." (National News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Resolving the Issue of the Eastern Provinces Depends on the Unity of the Chinese People</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, a Central News Agency reporter visited the diplomatic authorities to inquire whether the resumption of Sino-Russian relations could open up a favorable path for resolving the issue of the three eastern provinces. According to reports, the resumption of Sino-Russian relations can promote international cooperation and create peace in the Far East, but the resolution of the issue of the eastern provinces still requires the sincere unity and concerted efforts of the Chinese people. If the Chinese people can persist in long-term resistance, there will naturally be a day when the lost land is recovered. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang said that China and Russia's borders are connected, stretching for thousands of miles, and the relationship is close, like the United States' relationship with Canada. Since the 16th year of the Republic, although diplomatic relations have been severed, commercial relations still exist. There are Russian consulates in various parts of the three eastern provinces, and there are Chinese consulates in various parts of Russian Siberia, which is clear evidence that the two countries cannot completely sever relations. Chinese politics has always valued good neighborliness. In the past, due to different political histories, China and Russia developed a bad change in diplomatic relations, which is truly regrettable. Now, fortunately, normality has been restored, and we will certainly develop friendship with sincerity. In today's East Asia and the world, it can be regarded as a commemorative dawn of peace. (Special dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Approval from All Sides, Resuming Relations and Opposing Communism are Two Different Things</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The capital's newspapers all expressed their approval of the resumption of Sino-Russian relations. The Central Daily News said that this is the concrete realization of public opinion over the past few years, and praised the diplomatic authorities' decisiveness. The newspaper also stated that the resumption of diplomatic relations is a common occurrence in diplomacy, and there is no need to worry about gains and losses. The success or failure of diplomatic operations depends entirely on whether the court and the public can be more vigilant and encouraging, then the success of diplomacy may not be impossible to create from this. The New Beijing Daily said that the resumption of Sino-Russian relations and the recognition of Germany's demand for equality in military equipment by Britain, France, and Italy are the two most meaningful international events recently. The resumption of Sino-Russian relations is the beginning of a necessary diplomatic relationship for the two countries to create a new era of peace and prosperity in the Far East. Resuming relations and opposing communism are two completely different things. The issue with Japan also depends entirely on one's own efforts. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Southwest authorities expressed their approval of the resumption of Sino-Russian relations. (Special dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>The New Ambassador to Russia Will Belong to Mo Dehui</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A certain diplomat said that the new ambassador to Russia will belong to Mo Dehui. The central government plans to summon Zhu Shaoyang to Beijing to inquire about diplomatic events with Russia. (Special dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Karakhan to Serve as Ambassador to China, Says Far Eastern Bank Will Reopen</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The conclusion of the Sino-Russian trade treaty and the non-aggression treaty is still being handled by Mr. Yan Huiqing before the ambassador to Russia is announced. Also, according to outside sources, after the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, it is said that the Russian ambassador to China will be the current Deputy Commissioner of the Russian Foreign Affairs Committee, Karakhan. (Special dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to diplomatic sources, the Soviet Russian Embassy will still be located at its old site in Dongjiaomin Lane, Beiping, for the convenience of handling negotiations with our government. It may also set up an office in Shanghai. The Soviet Union's Far Eastern Bank and the Soviet Union News Agency will both officially reopen after the resumption of relations. (Special dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Soviet Russian Commercial Director Zhalaman said that he returned to his country for private affairs before, and was very happy and fortunate to hear the news of the resumption of Sino-Russian relations on the way back to Beiping. After China and Russia broke off diplomatic relations in recent years, contact between the people of the two countries was lost. This resumption of diplomatic relations was unexpected. The Soviet government has not yet issued instructions regarding the restoration of the embassy, ​​and the selection of ambassadors and consuls is even more out of the question. As for how the embassy will be restored in the future, it cannot be answered at this time. (Special dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russian Newspaper Commentary</h3>
<p>(Moscow) All newspapers in the Soviet Union take the resumption of Sino-Russian relations as proof that Soviet Russia's peaceful policies have gradually been recognized by the world and can be regarded as a major force for consolidating peace in the Far East. Izvestia claimed that because the situation is becoming increasingly tense and the imperialist aggression policies have made China understand that it was previously instigated by a certain third country to sever ties with Soviet Russia, which has increased China's diplomatic difficulties. The newspaper also stated that China currently has extremely ambitious revolutionary consciousness, but this matter is neither something that Soviet Russia can pre-hear, so its responsibility cannot naturally be added to the Soviet Union. Several other newspapers announced that the Soviet Russian government's addition of attention to protecting Chinese military officers Su Bingwen, etc., was actually due to Japan's repeated demands to extradite Su Bingwen, etc., or imprison them in Russian territory, which was rejected with extremely harsh words. This move was indeed one of the reasons for promoting the establishment of Sino-Russian understanding in Geneva. (National Telegram of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Izvestia expressed resentment at the statement made by the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the resumption of Sino-Russian relations is detrimental to Japan, saying that Japanese diplomats believe that it is harmful for China to maintain normal relations with Soviet Russia, but it is beneficial for China to maintain normal relations with Japan. This kind of thinking is contradictory and illogical. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Roundabout Ways Lead to Failure</h3>
<p>Hoping to Use the Puppet Organization to Conclude a Treaty with Russia, But Soviet Russia Saw Through the Cunning Plan, and Hopes for Friendship Were Dashed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, the Japanese diplomatic community was flustered and at a loss, and was particularly embarrassed. The activities of Hirota and Matsuoka have all become bubbles, and hopes for friendly relations between Japan and Russia have been completely dashed. According to reliable sources in the diplomatic community, Japan's failure was entirely due to its diplomatic policy being too roundabout and slippery. The Japanese side originally planned to have the so-called "Manchukuo" come forward and conclude a non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia, while Japan would remain behind the scenes, so that the status of the so-called "Manchukuo" would be further guaranteed, and Japan's military actions against Soviet Russia could still remain unrestricted. This kind of cunning plan was seen through by Soviet Russia long ago, resulting in today's dismay. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Newspapers Admit Japan's Diplomatic Incompetence</h3>
<p>China, America, and Russia Join Hands, Japan is Isolated</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published an editorial on the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, saying that the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, which developed by taking advantage of the unpreparedness of Japanese-Russian diplomacy, has a solid reason for its existence. Soviet Russia has repeatedly proposed a non-aggression treaty to Japan, attempting a political approach between Japan and Russia, but Japan has consistently stubbornly rejected this attitude. It is undeniable that it is not very difficult to make Soviet Russia take the lead in recognizing "Manchukuo," but it depends on the political and diplomatic activities of Japan. If Japan, Russia, and Manchuria firmly shake hands, there is no need to care about how much the League of Nations is stirring. Now, as a result of the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, the Soviet Union's previously good attitude towards "Manchukuo," although not completely changed, will inevitably be considerably restrained due to its relationship with China in the future. Relations between Russia and Manchuria will inevitably be more turbulent than before. Japan's incompetent diplomacy, which abandoned Japanese-Russian relations halfway for no reason, has resulted in the Su Bingwen issue, and it can be asserted that the result is unfavorable to Japan. (Domei News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, the Hochi Shimbun published an editorial today, saying that we have no expectations for the resumption of Sino-Russian relations. If the relationship between China and Japan and Japan and Russia is not corrected as it is now, the closeness and handshake between China and Russia is inevitable, and it is enough to make Soviet Russia cater to the wishes of the United States and demand its recognition with all its strength. If the three countries of China, the United States, and Russia, which surround Japan, inevitably shake hands behind Japan's back, Japan will become isolated. I hope that the government will be strong and not disappoint the people in the government's diplomatic skills, and this so-called strength is not just being static and motionless. (Domei News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Candidate for Ambassador to Russia</h3>
<p>Is Being Solicited with Russian Consent, May Be Announced Soon, Rumors that Wang Zhengting and Chen Youren Are Not Accurate</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, both sides will send ambassadors to each other. The candidate for our first ambassador has been internally decided and is being solicited with Russian consent, and may be announced within a day or two. Rumors that Wang Zhengting or Chen Youren will serve as ambassador are absolutely inaccurate. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador Visits Uchida</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan, Troyanovsky, visited Foreign Minister Uchida at 3:00 PM on the 13th to report in detail and request understanding regarding the resumption of Sino-Russian relations. Foreign Minister Uchida replied with ceremonial greetings. (Domei News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Panic</h3>
<p>Russian Goods Take the Opportunity to Dump on China, Sales of Japanese Goods Will Be Hit</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The resumption of Sino-Russian relations has caused a major ripple in Japanese military and political circles, especially in the economic world. According to a certain businessman, the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods has failed in the past, for two reasons: 1. In the past, Japanese goods were relatively cheap compared to other foreign goods, so the average consumer could not withstand a long-term boycott and their lives became difficult. 2. There are currently no completely Chinese goods that can replace them. Therefore, the most noteworthy thing about the resumption of Sino-Russian relations is that it can make up for the above two points. Russia has been implementing a dumping policy towards foreign countries due to the success of its five-year plan, and the pricing policy implemented by Russian goods in foreign countries is based on the lowest possible prices. Therefore, Russian goods can be dumped unconditionally wherever they go, and general merchants are actively expanding their business because they believe that doing business with Russia is profitable. This time, Russian goods are taking the opportunity to dump into China, giving the position of Japanese goods in China the most serious blow, which is undoubtedly true, because Chinese merchants have thick profits to make by promoting Russian goods, and they can avoid the ugly name of being traitors. Therefore, after Russian commercial officials arrive, Chinese merchants will compete to expand their business. In this way, the impact will be a hundred times more severe than anti-Japanese propaganda. Anti-Japanese salvation requires sacrificing one's own interests with pain, while this can achieve both fame and fortune. Merchants who boycott Japanese goods can make a full profit, and they will not be able to stop even if they want to. Chinese goods and Russian goods complement each other's shortcomings, then the anti-Japanese movement cannot be cured even with airplanes and cannons. Communist thoughts are indeed terrible, but economic warfare is even more terrible. (China United Press dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of the League of Nations General Assembly Resolution of March 11 This Year</h3>
<p>Chapter 1 The General Assembly considers that the provisions of the Covenant are fully applicable to this dispute, especially the following three points: 1. The principle of respecting treaties, 2. The responsibility of member states of the League of Nations to respect and preserve the territorial integrity, political independence, and opposition to foreign aggression of all member states of the League of Nations, 3. The obligation of member states of the League of Nations to submit any disputes between them to conciliation,</p>
<p>Adopt the principles specified in the declaration of the former President of the Executive Yuan, Briand, on December 10, 1931,</p>
<p>Recalling the fact that eleven members of the Executive Yuan cited this principle in their application to the Japanese government on February 16 of this year, which read: "Any act that violates the provisions of Article 10 of the Covenant, infringes on the territorial integrity of any member state of the League of Nations, and changes the administrative independence shall not be considered valid by the member states, because the above-mentioned principles for preventing international relations and settling disputes between members of the League of Nations are fully consistent with the Paris Peace Pact. The second article of this pact, the cornerstone of the world peace mechanism, states that the contracting countries agree that any disputes that arise between them, regardless of their nature or cause, shall be resolved only by peaceful means.</p>
<p>The dispute submitted to the General Assembly, in addition to waiting for a decision on how to resolve it, hereby declares that the above-mentioned principles and the binding nature of each provision and the responsibility of all member states of the League of Nations to recognize all treaties and agreements that violate the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Paris Peace Pact are binding.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 The General Assembly confirms that resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute by any party through the oppression of military force violates the spirit of the Covenant, recalling the resolution passed by the Executive Yuan on September 30, 1931, agreed to by both parties, recalling the resolution passed by this General Assembly on January 4, 1932, with the consent of both parties, implementing a ceasefire, withdrawing Japanese troops, and preparing to support those powers in Shanghai with special interests, and still requesting their joint maintenance of order in the troop withdrawal area when necessary. Chapter 3 The General Assembly, because the Chinese government requested on January 29 to apply the procedures stipulated in Article 15 of the Covenant to this dispute, because the Chinese government requested on February 12 to submit this dispute to the General Assembly in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 of Article 15 of the Covenant, and because the Executive Yuan believes in its resolution of February 19 that the entire dispute for the purpose of the Chinese government's request has been submitted to the General Assembly, the General Assembly has the obligation to use the conciliation procedures stipulated in Section 3 of Article 15 of the Covenant, and, if necessary, the recommendation procedures stipulated in Section 4 of the same article, and decides to organize a committee of twenty-nine people, with the president of the General Assembly serving as chairman, the members of the Executive Yuan (excluding the representatives of China and Japan) serving as committee members, and the remaining six committee members being elected by secret ballot. The "Committee of Nineteen" acts on behalf of the General Assembly and is supervised by the General Assembly to handle the following matters: 1. Report promptly on the ceasefire and the implementation of the ceasefire and the withdrawal of Japanese troops in accordance with the methods stipulated in the General Assembly resolution of March 4, 1932, 2. Observe the implementation of the two Executive Yuan resolutions of September 30, 1931, and December 10, 3. In accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of Article 15 of the Covenant, and with the consent of both parties, strive to resolve this dispute and report to the General Assembly, 4. If necessary, recommend consulting the opinion of the International Court of Justice, 5. If necessary, draft a report in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 of Article 15 of the Covenant, 6. If necessary, recommend any emergency measures, 7. Report the first business progress to the General Assembly as soon as possible, with May 1, 1932, as the deadline, the General Assembly and the Executive Yuan shall send all relevant documents that should be forwarded to the Association, together with any opinions of the Yuan, to the Committee of Nineteen. The General Assembly shall continue to be in session, and the meeting may be convened at any time if the president deems it necessary,</p>

<h3>The Opening of the Third Plenary Session in Earnest</h3>
<p>In a situation where the Northeast issue has become a stalemate and internal wars are erupting one after another, the Third Plenary Session, bearing the heavy responsibility of leading politics, is opening today. Leaders of the party gather in one hall to jointly plan how to overcome the difficulties of the time and re-establish the foundation of the nation. Its relationship to the survival of our nation is extremely significant, and the hopes of the people of the country for this great meeting are particularly profound.</p>
<p>Looking back from September 18th to the present, this kind of gathering with major significance, from the First Plenary Session, the Second Plenary Session, to the National Crisis Conference, and the Scholars' Conference, has occurred four times. In these several major conferences, almost all possible plans for resisting humiliation and saving the nation have been put forward. Unfortunately, most of these plans have been shelved, so although the national crisis has lasted for more than a year, the essence of the national crisis remains unchanged, and even tends to become more serious and difficult.</p>
<p>Today, the Third Plenary Session opens again. What is presented to the Third Plenary Session is that the Northeast issue has evolved from a rapid military invasion into an international political struggle; the puppet state of Manchukuo has been openly established and has obtained Japan's open official recognition; and the troops of Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen have gradually shown signs of defeat after arduous struggles. Domestically, there are the Lu unrest, the Sichuan-Guizhou unrest, the decline of rural areas, the suffering of the people, and the rise of bandits. Therefore, on the opening day of today's Third Plenary Session, we want to contribute our meager efforts, but we only feel that we are surrounded by devastation, with a myriad of problems, and we do not know where to start.</p>
<p>However, we believe that the way of governing is not only about improving details, but especially about correctly grasping the direction. If the direction can be corrected, then by following this path forward, even if it cannot immediately enter the right track, it should not lead to major mistakes. The current problems of our country can be summarized in one sentence: external troubles and internal worries. In our view, the direction for dealing with external troubles should be "force," and the direction for stabilizing internal worries should be "trust."</p>
<p>Why do we say this? Since the September 18th Incident, we have only trusted the League of Nations, but in fact, the Northeast issue in the League of Nations is only a tool for the great powers to engage in intrigue and play with their diplomatic skills. How the issue should be resolved ultimately only involves procrastination and delay. As the recent speech by the British representative Simon has clearly and strongly shown the true face of this issue, it can be seen that appeals to public justice are futile. In the current situation, only "force" can resist aggression, and only "force" can save the country from danger. Everything else besides "force" is empty talk. However, the "force" we are talking about should have a basic understanding, that is, the "force" of a few people is not as good as the "force" of many people. Only the "force" of the people is the greatest. Only when the government can awaken the people and cooperate with the people can the people exert their great "force." To talk about "force" without the people, then the "force" will not be effective and will not be able to resist humiliation and save the nation. This is one explanation.</p>
<p>Secondly, what the people expect from the government today is reality. Only reality can show the "great trust" of the government, and only reality can best gain the faith of the people. If it says "resist external aggression," then it should be manifested in reality immediately. If it says "alleviate the people's suffering," then it should also be manifested in reality immediately. Extending this to "sincere unity," "abolishing excessive taxes and levies," and "freedom of speech," then everything that has been said should be manifested in reality. There is no other reason, it is only "trust." Only "trust" can rectify discipline, and only "trust" can subdue the people. If words and actions are contradictory, and the facts are as far apart from the declarations as heaven and earth, then "trust" will not be established, and prestige will have no way to be established. And if you want to establish a strong and powerful center to eliminate internal worries, it is difficult to do. This is another explanation.</p>
<p>In short, the current national situation is precarious. Those in power should focus on the long-term and not be limited to local interests, short-term details, or personal grievances. Trust the people, unite with the people, and gather the strength of the whole nation to safeguard the survival of our nation. This is the way out for our nation, and it is also the way out for the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>The Capital's Gathering to Welcome Chiang Kai-shek | Held Yesterday in the Auditorium of National Central University |</p>
<h3>Flags Hung Throughout the City, Airplanes Spread Propaganda, Representatives from All Walks of Life Reached 2,000, Four Proposals and One Telegram Passed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital's Gathering to Welcome Chiang Kai-shek was held in the auditorium of National Central University on the morning of the 14th. The venue was decorated very solemnly. Slogans were posted throughout the venue, and guards were added nearby. A troop of Boy Scouts maintained order inside the venue. Flags and colored ribbons were hung throughout the city, and welcome slogans were posted. At Xinjiekou Archway, the characters of the slogan were decorated with electric lights. The propaganda team of more than 20 people organized by the conference was active everywhere. The Aviation Administration dispatched two airplanes to scatter small colored slogans. From Chiang's residence to National Central University, guards were added along the way. Participants in the welcome included Central Committee members Song Ziwen, Chen Lifu, Dai Chuanxian, Yang Xingfo, Zhou Fohai, Li Ciwen, Chu Minyi, Wang Qi, Ding Chaowu, Xie Zuomin, Wang Luyi, Hong Ludong, Zeng Zhongming, Zhu Peide, Zai Kuisheng, Cheng Tianfang, He Yaozu, Shi Ying, Zhu Jiahua, Luo Jialun, Tang Youren, Shao Yuanchong, etc., Zhangjia and Mongolian representatives, the Kyoto Municipal Party Committee, and representatives from various agencies, legal entities, and schools, approximately 2,300 people. Chairman Chiang arrived at the internal affairs meeting at 9:00 AM to give instructions, and at 10:00 AM, the conference sent personnel to welcome him. Chiang, accompanied by Wu Siyu and Deng Wenyi, went to the meeting by car. Chiang arrived at the venue at 10:50 AM, wearing a black overcoat, a yellow woolen Zhongshan suit, and a gray top hat, looking radiant. He greeted the welcomers and took his seat. The conference opened, chaired by Zhou Bomin, who delivered an opening speech, stating the significance of the welcome in three points. Chiang gave a speech (the speech is attached later). Cheng Bingzhi, a representative from the labor community, delivered a speech. The chairman reported that the conference also welcomed the Zhangjia Living Buddha. Zhangjia stood up to express his gratitude. Four proposals were passed: (1) A resolution to comfort Chairman Chiang and present a letter of comfort and a victory flag; (2) A telegram of condolence to the soldiers suppressing the bandits; (3) In accordance with Chairman Chiang's telegram to relieve the refugees in the bandit areas, to arouse the efforts of compatriots across the country to assist; (4) A telegram to compatriots in Mongolia, Manchuria, Hui, and Tibet to unite and consolidate the foundation of the country and complete construction. The conference distributed a special issue of the welcome to Chiang Kai-shek, and two types of letters to comrades and compatriots. After the military conference passed the four proposals, it shouted slogans and adjourned. (Special dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech at the welcome meeting on the 14th, briefly stated that after the September 18th Incident, the national situation became more dangerous. Because of my position in military and political affairs, I feel not only ashamed but also extremely indignant about this national crisis. Fortunately, I have been able to retain this body to serve the country and the nation. As long as I live, this ambition will not change. For more than a year, the whole country has been in a state of depression and suffering. Now, the road to saving the country lies in diplomacy and politics. Speaking from all aspects, both domestic and foreign, I dare to say that there is a way out. Last year, due to the pressure of foreign troubles, the domestic will was not unified, resulting in the failure of the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi. Even the people of various provinces have been displaced, which is truly heartbreaking. Although there is a way to save the country, I still hope to work hard to move forward. Otherwise, the crisis will immediately return. As the saying goes, "People must insult themselves before others insult them." If we are competitive, others will not dare to invade. Our China is a nation of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, but now it is being insulted and scolded as an unorganized country. After some reflection, even if the words of the enemy are harsh, they can be good medicine. Saving the country requires a precise and organized structure, that is, a disciplined organization. The so-called discipline is the ancient saying "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame." If we want national rejuvenation, we must start from the inherent spirit of the nation, that is, restoring propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Do not engage in empty talk about resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists. If we know the cause of the crisis, we can plan the way to save the country. Without propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, there is no discipline. Without discipline, there is no organization. Only with the inherent spirit of the nation can we restore the nation's position. Today, I respectfully share the four characters "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" with all sectors of the capital. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Immediately after Chiang returned to Kyoto, he entrusted Zeng Zhongming to send a telegram to Wang Jingwei to inquire about his illness and to hope that he would recover soon so that he could return to the country and preside over the central government. (Special dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Kyoto, he met with various important people and dealt with the affairs of the military conference, being extremely busy. All the members of the Central Committee in Kyoto believed that Chiang had made great achievements in supervising the suppression of the Red bandits and successively recovering the bandit areas. They decided to hold a banquet for Chiang on the evening of the 15th at the Lizi Society to express their condolences. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<h3>The Adventures of a Malay</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) A Malay today told news reporters at a local hospital about his dangerous experiences, which were almost unbelievable to those who heard them. According to him, he was working on a farm in Pahang, British Malaya, when he was suddenly swept into the air by a hurricane and eventually fell into the sea. Fortunately, a tree trunk that had been uprooted by the wind was next to him, and he quickly climbed onto it and drifted for six days and nights, about 800 miles from Singapore, in the middle of huge waves, floating and sinking like a cork, and never eating. Later, he was rescued by the ship Karawangxia and taken to Hong Kong, where he was sent to the hospital, but he was already in a dying state. (Reuters dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Attended the Fifth and Sixth General Assemblies of the Internal Affairs Conference and Gave Instructions</p>
<h3>To Save the Country, We Must First Reform People's Hearts; To Brush Up Politics, We Must First Painfully Eliminate Accumulated Bad Habits</h3>

(Special dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sixth General Assembly of the Internal Affairs Conference was held on the afternoon of the 14th to discuss the 20 cases of the Police Affairs Group, which were all passed according to the review opinions. (Special dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave instructions at the venue of the Internal Affairs Conference, briefly stating that in recent years, China has been plagued by internal Red bandits and external aggression by strong neighbors, which has shaken the foundation of the country and prevented the revolution from succeeding. The biggest reason is the corruption of internal affairs. The various ways to rectify internal affairs indicated to us by the Premier's Founding Strategy and Founding Program had already anticipated that if China did not start with reforming internal affairs, it would be difficult to avoid the insults of foreigners and even lead to the disaster of national extinction. China's lack of unity has two relations: one is the lack of progress in the implementation of party affairs, and the other is the degeneration of politics too without spirit, which has made a country with thousands of years of cultural history, independence, and freedom decline day by day due to these two ills, which is very painful. He said that to resist foreign aggression, we must first secure the home front, and also said that the country must first attack itself before others attack it. If the whole country can awaken and jointly go to the goal of improving internal affairs, opening a new era for our country, nation, and party ideology, I believe that resisting foreign insults will ultimately not be a problem. Since I took on the work of suppressing bandits half a year ago, I initially used military force to eliminate them, but it had little effect. Later, I received a reliable report and learned about the inside story of the Communists, who have a kind of organization for local labor and other matters. Therefore, I focused on political power to influence people's hearts, which was very effective. Chinese politics has always been chaotic and unauthorized, which is an obstacle to progress. Now, at this time of crisis and survival, if we want to save the country, we must first start with reforming people's hearts and changing customs. If we cannot achieve this goal, then the country will not be able to be saved. After the Ming Dynasty was destroyed, the doctrines written by Gu Yanwu summarized the root causes of the painful history of national destruction, which can serve as a good lesson for later generations seeking national revival. We should pay attention to it. No country in the world can be strong without good internal affairs. Although the planes and cannons of foreigners are far superior to ours, if we can strive for self-improvement and do everything well, such as land, household registration, security, and transportation, everything will be organized and orderly. I believe that after five years, the national strength will naturally be enriched and the old rules will be changed. Then, resisting Japan and saving the country will be guaranteed. Otherwise, not only will the strength of China's 2 million troops be insufficient to resist Japan, but even with 20 million troops, it will be difficult to compete with others. We must know that the responsibility of managing internal affairs is several times greater than the responsibility of leading troops. The power of improving internal affairs is also several times greater than the power of the army. The effort of internal affairs is also several times more effective than military effort. To improve internal affairs, we must know where the previous accumulated bad habits are and eliminate them painfully. The worst accumulated bad habits in the past were slowness, buck-passing, hypocrisy, frivolity, corruption, and selfishness, acting against one's beliefs. If these bad habits can be painfully eliminated and new politics can be improved with a new spirit, taking revolution must first transform the mind as the guiding principle, it can be asserted that the country will not perish and the nation can be revived. Therefore, I hope that all comrades will return to their provinces and strive to be fast, punctual, and honest. Regarding the above-mentioned shortcomings, correct them if you have them, and encourage yourselves if you don't have them. This is what I hope all comrades will contribute to today.

<p>More Than 20,000 Japanese Troops Concentrated on the Puppet Fengshan Line, Planning to Eliminate Zheng's Troops in One Fell Swoop</p>
<h3>Sun Zhen's Division Once Recovered Qiansuo</h3>
<p>(Beiping) More than 20,000 troops from the Japanese 8th Division have recently concentrated on the Puppet Fengshan Line, planning to eliminate the volunteer army led by Zheng Guilin in one fell swoop. On the 7th, Zheng's troops sent a small number of subordinates to attack Qianwei, making contact with the Japanese army. More than 10,000 soldiers of Zheng's troops have been fighting fiercely with the Japanese army in Qianwei, Qiansuo, and Suizhong since the 9th, and the outcome has not yet been determined.

A part of the army detoured to Qiansuo and encountered the Iron Blood Army, attacking the enemy troops in the area together. The enemy retreated, and Qiansuo was occupied by us. Fearing that the enemy's Yuguan Brigade would come to aid, they retreated to the defense area, killing dozens of enemies, capturing more than 40 guns, more than 10 steel helmets, and countless military supplies. Our side only suffered one soldier killed or wounded and lost more than 450 bullets. (Special dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<h3>The National Salvation Army Attacked Yixian and Occupied Huishanzi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Dai Tao of the Northeast National Salvation Army formed the Northeast National Salvation Allied Army in the Pingfang area of Chaoyang. On the 3rd of this month, 1,200 people attacked Yixian in columns. Enemy armored vehicles, planes, and tanks all participated in the battle. Our soldiers bravely advanced and fought fiercely. In the afternoon, the enemy dispatched an armored vehicle from Jin County and used machine guns and mortars to attack us fiercely. Due to the disparity in numbers, they retreated to the Donghe River, killing 30 enemy officers and soldiers. Our army suffered more than 20 casualties. After our army retreated to the Donghe River, they actively reorganized and attacked Yixian again on the 7th, occupying Huishanzi. They then used a pocket tactic to lure the enemy, and more than 30 enemy soldiers and more than 100 puppet police were wiped out. They captured two artillery pieces, two machine guns, more than 130 rifles, and more than 5,000 rounds of ammunition. On the night of the 9th, Dai Tao led more than 1,000 troops in a night attack on Yicheng. Due to the tight defense, after several hours of fierce fighting, they returned to the original defense.

<h3>US and French Envoys Express</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) US Envoy Zhan Lin said that the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia is a matter between China and Russia, and he has no comment. As for the report that the US and Russia will also resume diplomatic relations after Roosevelt takes office next year, he has not heard of this yet. However, he firmly believes that the US policy towards the Far East will not change due to personnel changes. French Envoy Wei Lidun, who had just returned from Shanghai, said that he had already heard about the news of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia in Shanghai. After arriving in Kyoto and seeing that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs had published the exchange of letters, he personally did not want to express joy or sorrow about the Far East situation after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. As for the report that France will sell goods to Japan, he strongly denied the claim. (Special dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<p>[L Che&gt; To Deal with War Debt Issues, the French and Belgian Cabinets Have Collapsed One After Another L&lt;]</p>
<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Committee Votes Against Paying Due U.S. War Debt</h3>
<p>Havas, Paris, 13th – The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, by a vote of 24 to 9, rejected the cabinet's draft bill on the war debt issue. The Finance Committee also rejected it by a vote of 22 to 9. The Foreign Affairs and Finance Committees have jointly drafted a motion requesting the government to temporarily postpone the payment of the war debt due on November 15th, and to determine a solution after deciding to convene a conference of debtor and creditor nations to fundamentally resolve the war debt issue. The Foreign Affairs Committee, by a vote of 24 to 4 (with 2 abstentions), approved the report of the joint motion of the two committees.</p>
<h3>Herriot's Proposal for Conditional Debt Repayment Fails</h3>
<p>Havas, Paris, 14th – The Herriot cabinet's proposal for conditional repayment of the war debt due on December 15th has been debated in the Chamber of Deputies for two days. This morning at 7:00 AM, a vote was held, and the Chamber of Deputies rejected the government's proposal by a vote of 402 to 187. This case is of great importance. Rejecting the government's proposal is tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the government. Therefore, the Herriot cabinet was overthrown. Yesterday, the Foreign Affairs and Finance Committees of the Chamber of Deputies had already opposed the cabinet's proposal for conditional payment. It was generally expected that the cabinet's future would be unfavorable, and the outcome has now been overturned.</p>
<h3>Anglo-French United Front Destroyed</h3>
<p>National Society, Paris, 14th – France is now about to default on its payment for the first time since the Third Republic. Despite Herriot's warning to the parliament that a default would destroy the post-war Anglo-French political united front, the Chamber of Deputies remained resolute in opposing the repayment of the war debt without receiving reparations. Finally, before dawn today, it passed a vote of no confidence in the government by a vote of 402 to 187. Thereupon, the Herriot cabinet submitted its resignation to the President at 6:00 AM after he rose.</p>
<p>After resigning, Herriot immediately declared that the war debt could not be paid as scheduled, stating that since the cabinet had fallen, it would be impossible to maintain the guarantees previously given to British Prime Minister MacDonald, and that in the current extraordinary political situation, no one would be able to secure a majority of support in the parliament.</p>
<h3>Radical Party Likely to Succeed in Forming a Cabinet</h3>
<p>After accepting the resignation, the French President ordered the cabinet to maintain its duties as usual until a new cabinet is formed. As for the successor, it seems that Socialist Chautemps (of the same party as Herriot) has the best chance, followed by the party's former leader Daladier. If the President decides to choose from the Senate, then Bérenger, who previously negotiated the war debt with U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon, or former Finance Minister Caillaux, are both promising candidates. It is expected that the President will meet with the speakers of both houses and the leaders of various parties today, and a decision will be made tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Herriot's Brief Biography</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Herriot is the leader of the Radical Socialist Party. He was born in Troyes on July 5, 1872. He has served as the mayor of Lyon since 1905 and was later elected as a senator for the Rhône department. Between 1916 and 1917, he served as the Minister of Transport in the sixth Briand cabinet. After the European War, Herriot gave up his Senate seat and instead entered the Chamber of Deputies. In 1924, the Left Wing Alliance came to power, and Herriot succeeded Poincaré as Prime Minister, but was overthrown the following year. He formed a cabinet again the next year, but was overthrown on his first appearance in the Chamber of Deputies. From July 23, 1926, to November 4, 1928, Herriot cooperated with the Poincaré cabinet, serving as the Minister of Education. Later, due to political disagreements, he led the Radical Socialist Party out of the cabinet. Since then, whether against the Tardieu cabinet or the Laval cabinet, Herriot has opposed them as the leader of the Radical Socialist Party and the party's leader in the parliament. It was not until the general election in May this year that the majority party in the Chamber of Deputies changed to the left wing, and the Tardieu cabinet resigned as a result. Herriot then formed the current cabinet on June 4th, which has lasted until now. (Havas)</p>
<h3>Fake Phone Call: Herriot's Political Enemies Play a Prank</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 13th – During the debate on the U.S. debt issue in the Chamber of Deputies today, a servant suddenly approached Prime Minister Herriot, saying that British Prime Minister MacDonald had a phone call and wanted to speak with the Prime Minister. Herriot went to talk to him. The person claimed to be MacDonald's private secretary and reported that the British government had changed its mind and decided not to pay the U.S. debt due in December. Herriot was greatly relieved. However, out of caution, he called the British Foreign Office in London to inquire about the truth and learned that the phone call he had just received was a hoax, probably done by Herriot's political enemies.</p>
<h3>Royalists Demonstrate, Shouting "Don't Pay a Penny to the U.S."</h3>
<p>After the discovery of this phone call incident, a thousand royalists tried to break through the police cordon and shouted "Don't pay a penny to the U.S." in front of the Chamber of Deputies, causing a great disturbance. When a large police force rushed to suppress them, the demonstrators uprooted two trees, preventing a tram from running. Three people among the rioters were injured and sent to the hospital, while the rest were detained in the police station and released after one or two hours. At midnight, another group of royalists attempted to disrupt the Chamber of Deputies, but were stopped by the police, who arrested about 258 people, including journalist Pu Xuer, who was immediately released.</p>
<h3>Belgium Unable to Pay, Cabinet Collapses</h3>
<p>National Society, Brussels, 13th – The Belgian cabinet has resigned. It is reported that the war debt issue was also a major reason for its early collapse. Although most of the cabinet members advocated paying, the financial resources did not allow them to do so. Before resigning, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs drafted a note to notify the United States, declaring that a default would be necessary. The note stated that since the United States could not extend the suspension period, and the Lausanne Reparations Agreement had cut off Belgium's reparations income, it was impossible to cope with the war debt. However, Belgium is prepared to cooperate with the U.S. to find a solution and hopes to cooperate further to solve other issues closely related to the war debt. The Belgian cabinet was a temporary coalition of Catholics and Liberals, and it was not expected to last long. Since the election results, the opinions of the two parties have become even more divergent, leading to the inevitability of resignation. Now, the war debt issue has accelerated its collapse.</p>
<h3>Britain's New Note to the U.S. Reiterates Reservations</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th – As far as Britain is concerned, it has explained the situation of the war debt in its recent note. The recent British note reiterated the previous reservations and used words that are less likely to be misunderstood. Members of the House of Commons today competed to ask Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain about the war debt, but the Chancellor did not answer, only saying that he would explain everything in detail during the debate tomorrow. The Chancellor also said that the debt payments between the Allied countries have been temporarily suspended pending the ratification of the Lausanne Agreement, but the government sincerely hopes that in the future, when studying the entire war debt issue in relation to world recovery, a solution can be obtained that would allow the great powers to ratify the Lausanne Agreement. The United States has now agreed to re-examine this entire issue. As for Britain's rights under the existing debt repayment agreement, they are fully reserved. Britain and France are not proceeding on a united front. Britain intends to resolve the issue with the United States separately if possible.</p>
<h3>U.S. Understanding of Britain, Prepared to Receive Payment</h3>
<p>National Society, Washington, 13th – The U.S. government decided today to collect cash for the war debt and will not pursue the matter further. Therefore, it will accept the British payment and will no longer engage in written correspondence. As for the British note's statement of reservations, it is willing to regard it merely as British commentary and explanation of the situation. Therefore, Secretary of State Stimson told people today that the negotiations between the United States and Britain have now come to an end and that we do not expect a reply to Britain's recent note.</p>
<h3>Hoover Takes Blame for Others, Faces Impeachment</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 13th – It is expected that the United States will no longer respond to Britain's latest note on the war debt, as the two governments now understand each other. Republican Congressman McFadden moved to impeach President Hoover for insisting that Britain repay the debt, but the House of Representatives rejected this motion by a vote of 361 to 8. Belgium and Poland have both refused to pay the December installment. The Czech minister claimed that the Czech Republic could pay the debt but requested an amendment. Although members of Congress still hold the attitude that the war debt must be paid, they are gradually aware of Europe's resentment towards their attitude. It is gradually felt that the December payment will be the last installment. President Hoover has already lost the election and is now taking the blame for others. French Prime Minister Herriot, in his speech in the French parliament, blamed the U.S. President for creating this situation. Many U.S. Congressmen are now using this statement to blame the President. Some believe that if the responsibility for the United States losing the world's favor is shifted to Hoover, future negotiations can be conducted on different terms than the current ones.</p>
<p>National Society, Washington, 13th – Today in the U.S. Congress, Republican Congressman McFadden introduced an impeachment motion against President Hoover, listing four charges: 1. Usurping the power of Congress; 2. Wasting national resources; 3. Forcing the people to enact bad laws, harming the country and benefiting foreign countries; 4. Attempting to damage the effect of the Liang Treaty, accusing him of high crimes and misdemeanors. However, only seven people supported this motion. After a vote, it was rejected by a vote of 361 to 8. After this motion was introduced, a young man in the gallery suddenly stood up, waved a pistol, and demanded the right to speak freely. He was arrested by the House police. These two incidents caused a shock in Congress unseen since the end of the war. However, after the shock subsided, they resumed discussing the budget.</p>
<h3>Italy Pays War Debt Due as Scheduled</h3>
<p>National Society, Rome, 14th – The Italian government, in accordance with the resolution of the Fascist Grand Council, ordered today to pay the war debt owed to the U.S. due tomorrow.</p>

<p>Disarmament Conference</p>
<h3>Small Countries Protest Secret Negotiations by the Five Powers, Davis and McCoy Depart for the U.S.</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 14th – At today's final meeting of the Steering Committee of the Disarmament Conference before Christmas, Poland protested against the recent talks between the five major powers. Romania, Yugoslavia, Uruguay, and Turkey all supported the protest, which expressed a concern that this method of secret consultation would become a permanent system. British Foreign Secretary Simon defended the actions of the five countries, saying that this method was special and did not intend to reduce the power of the conference.</p>
<p>National Society, Geneva, 13th – The Steering Committee of the Disarmament Conference reconvened this afternoon, chaired by Henderson. The German delegation quietly participated again. The seat of the German chairman's representative had been vacant for six months, and today it was occupied by Dr. Weizsäcker. The doctor did not mention the return of the German delegation to the conference. Only the chairman read out the compromise proposal on the equality dispute, which is expected to be approved by tomorrow's Steering Committee meeting. Then the committee will adjourn until the end of January next year, when the general debate on disarmament will resume. The French disarmament security agreement is the first item on the agenda. It is said that this is one of the conditions proposed by France for approving the Sunday plan. Before departing for New York, U.S. representative Davis addressed the foreign press representatives, mentioning that the United States proposed to adjourn the Disarmament Conference for several years and appoint a permanent disarmament committee to conduct all matters. Davis said that the agreement of the five major powers had temporarily handled the security and equality disputes and opened the way for a preliminary solution, enabling the disarmament negotiations to focus on specific issues to achieve real progress and solve the whole problem. This problem, by its nature, can only be solved gradually and not quickly. Davis meant that the French disarmament security plan would take two years to thoroughly discuss each point, which would be extremely time-consuming. Therefore, he intends to propose to postpone the discussion of this plan when the conference opens in January.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Geneva, 13th – U.S. disarmament representatives Davis and General McCoy departed from here at 10:50 this afternoon to return to the U.S. Davis did not express whether or not he would attend the Mediation Committee.</p>
<h3>British-Persian Oil Case Submitted to League of Nations, Persia Refuses to Submit to Hague Court of Arbitration</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 14th – The Persian government has submitted the dispute over the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's concession to the League of Nations for handling.</p>
<p>Reuters, Delhi, 14th – After Persia revoked the D'Arcy concession of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the British government sent a note to the Persian government on December 8th, stating that it did not recognize the validity of the unilateral revocation, and said that if the Persian government did not withdraw the previous resolution, Britain would have no other choice but to submit the matter to the International Court of Justice and ask it to protect its rights. The Persian government has replied, not recognizing the Hague International Court of Justice's jurisdiction over the Anglo-Persian oil case, nor does it recognize that the optional clause is applicable to this case. It also said that the actions of the British government were contrary to the spirit of justice and the intent of peace. The Persian government has the right to draw the League of Nations' attention to British oppression of Persia. The Persian government is naturally not responsible for any losses suffered by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The D'Arcy concession was granted by the Persian government in May 1901 for a period of sixty years and did not contain any clauses allowing either party to revoke it, but stipulated that the Persian government would receive 16% of the company's annual net profit. By the end of last year, the Persian government had received a total of £11,265,000.</p>

<h3>Simon Makes Serious Representations to Russia, Russian Ambassador to Britain Apologizes</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th – British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden reported in the House of Commons today on the results of Foreign Secretary Simon's serious representations to the Russian government regarding the anti-British propaganda published in the Russian newspaper Izvestia, stating that the Russian ambassador to Britain had verbally informed the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that although the Russian government was only responsible for the official communiqués published in the newspaper, it wished to state that it had never suspected the British Foreign Office and the British Foreign Secretary. As for what was published in the newspaper's article, the Russian government did not endorse the newspaper's comments, and the Russian ambassador had contacted the editor of the newspaper, who now admitted that the correspondent had made a mistake and acknowledged the inaccuracy of the comments and was willing to express his apologies. With this notification from the Russian ambassador, the British government considered the negotiations to be concluded. The newspaper article accused the British Foreign Office of instructing its personnel to forge anti-Russian documents.</p>

<h3>Strange Man Holds Gun in U.S. Congress, Congressmen are Stunned</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 13th – During a meeting of the House of Representatives today, a strange man jumped into the meeting hall from the gallery, holding a loaded pistol, and shouted loudly, "I want this meeting hall!" The congressmen, seeing this, were immediately stunned. But in a few seconds, they all rushed out the door, and the gallery was also in turmoil and screaming. At the same time, the strange man raised his gun at several congressmen as if he were about to shoot. The Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives approached the strange man and asked him to put down his gun. The strange man complied. The Sergeant-at-Arms picked it up and saw that the gun was loaded with live ammunition but the mechanism was locked. The police then escorted him out of the meeting hall.</p>
<h3>Japan's Plan to Annex Northeast Aviation Rights</h3>
<p>This newspaper translates the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo as saying: Since the establishment of "Manchukuo," the issue of maritime transport control by Japan and Manchuria has progressed to the issue of maritime transport connections between Japan, Korea, and Manchuria, which is also the issue of maritime rights in the Sea of Japan. For the sake of industrial control between Japan and Manchuria, it is urgent to connect the maritime transport facilities of the industrial organizations of Japan and Manchuria. The control plan for this issue has been negotiated and completed. In addition to the Dalian-Inland route, the new route between North Korea and the Sea of Japan will be implemented in April of next year. Currently, there are only two major sea routes connecting Dalian and the Inland, and passing through Korea, etc. From now on, two new sea routes and one land route will be opened from the three ports of Unggi, Chongjin, and Najin in North Korea to the three ports of Tsuruga, Fushiki, and Niigata in the Sea of Japan. The Dalian-Inland route is currently the Osaka Shosen and Near Seas Mail Lines' designated routes and free routes. Now, Kawasaki Kisen, Osaka Shosen, Dalian Steamship, and Okazaki Steamship will also participate in transporting Manchuria's special products, soybeans, soybean cake, wheat, other agricultural products, iron, coal, mineral products, wood, and salt, etc., totaling more than 7 million tons per year. The routes are stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>1. Dalian-Newchwang-Inland Route</p>
<p>a. Osaka Shosen (Designated Route) Inland-Dalian Line (Kobe-Moji-Dalian) Using ships Puliwei Maru 6,300 tons, Harbin Maru 5,100 tons, Baijia'er Maru 5,200 tons, Usuli Maru 6,300 tons</p>
<p>b. Near Seas Mail Lines (Designated Route, Yokohama-Newchwang Line (Yokohama-Nagoya-Yokkaichi-Osaka-Dalian-Tianjin-Newchwang-Dalian-Yokohama) Using ships Awaji Maru 1,900 tons, Genbu Maru 1,800 tons, Sagami Maru 1,800 tons, Katsuura Maru 1,700 tons</p>
<p>c. Kawasaki Kisen (Free Route) Keihin-Nagoya-Osaka-Dalian</p>
<p>d. Dalian Steamship (Free Route) Keihin-Nagoya-Dalian</p>
<p>e. Osaka Shosen (Free Route) Keihin-Nagoya-Osaka-Dalian</p>
<p>f. Okazaki Steamship (Free Route) Kitakyushu-Dalian-Yingkou</p>
<p>Other newly planned routes are as follows:</p>
<p>2. North Korea-Sea of Japan Route</p>
<p>a. Hokuriku Steamship (Local Government Designated Route) Fushiki-Nanaya-Vladivostok-Chongjin (Unggi, Chongjin, Wonsan)</p>
<p>b. Korean Mail Lines (Governor-General's Designated Route) Chongjin-Tsuruga (Chongjin, Chongjin, Wonsan, Miyazu, Maizuru, Tsuruga) Using ship Changbaishan Yintou Maru 2,100 tons, Wai Xinja 1,200 tons</p>
<p>c. Yokuki Steamship (Korean Governor-General's Designated Route) Hokkaido-Niigata-Chongjin-Unggi-Wonsan Using ship Kasato Maru 1,400 tons</p>
<p>d. Kita Nippon Steamship (Designated Route) Tsuruga-Niigata-Chongjin Using ship Shinko Maru</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Dalian Steamship, Osaka Shosen, Near Seas Mail Lines, the Ministry of Railways, etc., all have similar plans.</p>
<p>After the completion of the Dalian-Inland route, one of the two major sea routes, the Sea of Japan route will be extended to the South Manchurian Railway, with the port of Najin in North Korea as the terminal port. The port is scheduled to be completed in nine years, with an investment of 60 million yuan. Therefore, in the future, the Sea of Japan route will surpass the Dalian route and become the major route between Japan and Manchuria. Currently, the Eurasian connecting line via Vladivostok is bound to pass through the port of Najin due to geographical reasons. However, the participation of the Ministry of Railways in the plan will inevitably lead to conflict, because the Dalian Steamship of the Manchurian Railway system plans a new route that will threaten the Osaka Shosen's Kita Nippon Steamship.</p>
<p>Xu He's Remnant Bandits Plan to Flee to Gansu</p>
<h3>He Chengjun Ordered to Go to Shaanxi to Supervise the Bandit Suppression Headquarters and Report on the Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The remnants of the Xu He bandits, previously entering Shaanxi from Hubei, passing through Shangnan, Wenchuan Pass, Lan Pass, Yun County, Zhouzhi, crossing the Zhongnan Mountains, and crossing the Wei River to reach Fufeng, although repeatedly blocked and suppressed, ultimately escaped.

When Chairman Chiang was in Hankou, he instructed He Chengjun to go to Xi'an to supervise the bandit suppression, eradicating them completely. However, due to a lingering illness and the need to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, he was unable to go.

<p>Northeast Issue and the League of Nations</p>
<h3>Heated Debate Between Chinese and Japanese Representatives in the Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Geneva Correspondence: The League of Nations Council meeting, repeatedly postponed after much anticipation, finally opened at 11:00 a.m. on November 21st. The Sino-Japanese dispute is one of the main issues, attracting the most general interest. The investigation team entered first, sitting on the left end of the back row behind the podium, from left to right, Dr. Hiney, General McCoy, Sir Lytton, General Claudel, and Count Markode, Dr. Haas, Secretary-General of the Investigation Team, and other secretaries, sat closely below the podium behind Sir Lytton and others. After a while, Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative, and Sir Drummond, Secretary-General of the League of Nations, also entered, shaking hands and exchanging greetings with the investigation team. Dr. Yan Huiqing, the first Chinese representative, Minister Guo Taiqi, and other important members of the delegation, were all present to listen. After the photography, the chairman, President Hua Laila of the Irish Free State, De Vealera, delivered the opening speech, roughly stating that "The report of the Investigation Team and the 69th Council of the League of Nations, a group photo.</p>
<p>(Note) The second person from the left with the (×) mark is our representative Gu Weijun, and the first person at the extreme left is Sir Lytton, Chairman of the Investigation Team (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>has been distributed to the representatives of the Council and has been studied in detail. The Council, in order to eliminate difficulties and seek the truth in the unfortunate dispute between the two member states, decided to send a committee of five people to study on the spot any situation that affects international relations and may disturb the peace between China and Japan or the understanding on which peace is based, and to report to the Council. The adoption of this resolution has been more than eleven months ago. When Mr. Briand, the former President of the Council, proposed the above resolution, he stated that, in principle, the Investigation Team should study any issue within its broad terms of reference that it deems necessary. Briand also stated that the Investigation Team should have full discretion to decide which issues should be reported to the Council. The qualifications of the members of the Investigation Team were approved by the Council on January 14, 1932. The task of the team is extremely heavy, and it is able to devote itself wholeheartedly to the task. I know that all the representatives of the Council will express their most sincere gratitude to Sir Lytton and his members for their fair, just, and insightful report. The report of the Investigation Team was unanimously agreed by all the members. Its content not only states the facts of the Sino-Japanese incident and its historical background, but also observes the opinions on the methods for the League of Nations to resolve the case. Therefore, in my capacity as chairman, I would like to thank Sir Lytton and his colleagues on behalf of the Council for the perfect success of their work. The fact that the Investigation Team was able to be appointed, and that it was able to complete its work with the support of the two countries in dispute and the cooperation of the representatives of the two countries, is a gratifying fact and enough to give us encouragement. I hope that in the future, when there are organizations of this kind of investigation team, the methods of proceeding can be improved to avoid the lengthy negotiations before the appointment of the members. However, this matter is irrelevant to our current work. I believe that the success of the Lytton Investigation Team, in addition to contributing to the Sino-Japanese dispute, has actually established a precedent of great value and formed a truly concrete progress in the difficult future of the League of Nations. In addition to submitting a formal report, the Investigation Team also made a preliminary report on April 19 while in the three eastern provinces. The report and several attachments have also been distributed to the representatives of the Council for study. All the uncorrected samples of the attachments have been sent to the Chinese and Japanese governments. The Investigation Team has of course considered these attachments when preparing the formal report. Our discussion at this time should naturally take the formal report as the main document. As for the procedure for our discussion of this case at this time, it should be remembered that when the Investigation Team was still conducting its investigation, the Council passed a resolution on February 19 of this year, deciding to submit the Sino-Japanese dispute to the League of Nations General Assembly in accordance with Article 15, Section 9 of the League of Nations Covenant, knowing that: the collection of various factual reports necessary for considering the dispute will continue to be carried out, requesting: both parties to the dispute shall, in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, Section 1 of the Covenant, send as much as possible all opinions and information regarding the case to the Secretariat for submission to the General Assembly for selection, declaring that: the Council's responsibility to maintain peace in accordance with the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant will not be changed by this resolution." After the above resolution was transferred to the General Assembly, the General Assembly again resolved on March 10 that: 1. The request submitted by the Chinese government, including the entire dispute, has been transferred to the General Assembly by the Council, deciding: "Organize a Committee of Nineteen," applying: "The Council shall send to the Committee of Nineteen all documents that it deems should be transferred to the General Assembly, together with the Council's opinion." I propose that the discussion of this case should begin with a statement by the representative of the Japanese government, in order to supplement the statement made by the Japanese government on the report of the Investigation Team. When the meeting resumes in the afternoon, the representative of the Chinese government will state his views."</p>
<p>Next, Japanese representative Yosuke Matsuoka gave a speech in the tone of a warlord, with dogmatic attitude and sharp language, on the one hand, fiercely attacking the chaos inside China, and on the other hand, explaining in detail "how the State of Manchuria is organized," while preparing for the League of Nations and the Investigation Team, and involving countries such as Britain, France, and the United States, and what he emphasized most was to ask the League of Nations not to interfere in the affairs of "Manchuria." Everyone felt uncomfortable after hearing it. The Geneva newspaper criticized it, saying, "Poor Japan," because it was out of touch with the times. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Panchen Passes Through Xuzhou En Route to Jinjing</p>
<h3>Panchen Will Return to Beiping Soon and Go to Mongolia, Outer Mongolian Representatives Accompany Him to Jinjing</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Panchen Lama is scheduled to enter Beijing before the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has sent representatives Chen Jingxiu and Luosang Jianzan to Beiping to welcome him. Panchen's special train arrived in Xuzhou at 4:00 p.m. today (the 13th). Jinpu Railway personnel and reporters from various newspapers waited at the station and paid their respects. It was learned that the entourage included about 40 people, including Tenke Demuchukedonglu, a relative of Xilin Gol League, and Kanbu Weishi. Some wore fashionable clothes, some wore Qing Dynasty attire, and the colors were also very bright. Panchen wore a golden-red Kujia fur robe, thick-soled cotton shoes, held a Hada in his hand, and took off his hat to show his head. When he met with reporters, he spoke in Tibetan, which was translated by Ding Wangduoji. Panchen made a statement, saying that he was ordered by the Western Frontier Official to take office, but the date was not yet determined, because important issues were still awaiting consultation with the central government. He had long wanted to go to Beijing, but had not been able to do so. Now, taking advantage of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, he came to Beijing to discuss everything. In the future, he also intended to mediate various issues related to Tibet after consultation and take measures. He would return to Beiping after the Third Plenary Session and set off for Mongolia first, because the situation in Mongolia was currently very urgent. He also intended to participate in the Third Plenary Session in Beijing, and would probably not stay for too long. When talking about this, the reporter asked whether he would hold the Kalachakra initiation ceremony in Beijing after holding it in Beiping. Panchen said that the initiation ceremony was a manifestation of Buddhism, and if there was an opportunity, it might be held. The windows of the car Panchen was riding in were slowly covered with yellow satin, and the seat cushions were also made of yellow satin. The reporter then met Chen Jingxiu in the rear car. Chen said that he went to Qinghai to promote the central government's good intentions, and the local ethnic groups understood it very well. Zeng Bai Hutu Ketu, thousands of households, lamas, and others sent a joint telegram to support the central government, and the western frontier showed a very good situation. Panchen's special train headed south at 7:00 p.m. that night and was scheduled to stop at Bengbu for three hours. It was scheduled to arrive at Pu at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 14th) and cross the river to Beijing. In addition, Outer Mongolian representatives Diruwa Hutu Ketu and Jiabuse Pengzha Bu also took Panchen's special train to Beijing to report on the situation in Outer Mongolia. (December 13)</p>
<p>Jinan May 3rd Memorial Monument</p>
<h3>Built at the Site of Cai Gongshi's Martyrdom, the Completion Ceremony Was Held on the 12th</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Four years have passed in an instant since the May 3rd Massacre. In August of this year, Zhang Weicun of the Provincial Consolidation Committee, in order to leave a permanent memorial and shock the people, specially obtained the approval of the provincial government to build the May 3rd Memorial Monument at the Jian'guo Middle School in the commercial port Weiliu Road, formerly the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office (where Cai Gongshi and others were martyred). After several months of operation, it has now been completed. The monument is engraved with "May 3rd Memorial Monument Inscription" written by Zhang Weicun and the inscription written by He Siyuan. Around it are "The Spirit of Righteousness Will Last Forever" written by Han Fuju, "May 3rd" written by Zhang Weicun, "Sacrifice for the Country" written by Jiang Bocheng, and "Never Forget the Oath" written by Wang Fangting. The stone quality of the monument is excellent, and it is covered with a pavilion, which is solemn and magnificent. At 10:00 a.m. today (the 11th), the completion ceremony was held, and more than 500 people from all walks of life in the party and government and students from Jian'guo Middle School attended. Zhang Weicun made a brief announcement, saying that today is the completion ceremony of the May 3rd Memorial Monument, and at the same time, our school (that is, Jian'guo Middle School, Zhang is the principal of the school) is holding a supplementary opening ceremony. Recalling May 3, 1928, the Japanese army colluded with domestic warlords and caused the unprecedented Jinan Massacre. Many of our loyal soldiers and local compatriots were killed and injured. Although the Jinan case was resolved in May 1929, there was no effective solution, and the whole country was heartbroken. Although some people proposed building a memorial monument, it was repeatedly delayed due to various reasons until it was completed today. Then representatives from all walks of life successively gave speeches, with many words of grief. The photography meeting ended at 12:00. (December 12)</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<h3>Order from the Department to Reduce the Price of Deed Tax Collection</h3>
<p>This county received an order from the Department of Finance, stating that the deed tax in this province is designated as a construction public sentiment fund. Now, the fifth phase of the public bond is approaching, and the fund for repaying the principal and interest is far short, and it is urgent to raise funds as soon as possible to provide relief. According to the deed tax rate, the original price was nine for the sale and six for the pledge, and the amount of the original additional fees in various counties was too large, resulting in many private deeds that were hidden and not taxed. In order to make tax revenue prosperous, special consideration must be given. It is planned to limit it to one month from December 20th of this year, and all original surcharges and intermediary donations will also be reduced by half. The original overdue penalties will also be waived. It has been approved by the Provincial Government Conference, ordering the county government to issue a vernacular bulletin on the same day to widely inform the public, and at the same time, to inform the township chiefs widely. This is also a good opportunity for capitalists who buy property.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Joint Police Suppression of Lake Bandits by Land and Water</h3>
<p>The Dongshan liner in Taihu Lake was recently robbed by bandits in the Huangyang Bay area, and four passengers were kidnapped. The water and land police have been pursuing and suppressing them separately, but the case has not yet been solved. The County Chamber of Commerce has sent telegrams to the Civil Affairs Department and the Bandit Suppression Department, requesting them to quickly suppress and rescue the hostages. Yesterday (the 14th), the Suzhou-Songjiang Water Bandit Suppression Command received a telegram, saying that the electric order ordered Shen, the third district chief of the water public security, to supervise the team to enter the lake to suppress the bandits, rescue the hostages, and recover the hijacked guns and equipment, and handle the matter seriously. Phase electric reply words, heard that the county government here has consulted with the water and land police teams of various counties along Taihu Lake in Zhejiang Province to jointly encircle and suppress the bandits in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Electrically Disputes the Dismissal of the Real Industry Department</h3>
<p>Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, Chairman of the National Government, Chairman of the Military Commission, Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Junjian, the main facilities of the Jiangsu Provincial Silk Industry Department have a foundation and are gradually becoming effective. However, the provincial government suddenly dismissed the department and ordered the provincial and county industrial agencies to close down. The situation is panic. The silk industry is the main industry in Jiangsu Province. In recent years, it has been frequently hit. The department has tried its best to save it, test reforms, promote refined original seeds, and crack down on inferior seeds without hesitation, and has gradually turned the tide. The agricultural and silk industry cannot be interrupted for a day. Now, ordering the closure of several years of hard work will inevitably lead to the flow of water to the east, hinder production, and ignore people's livelihood. It is very important to order a quick correction to maintain the real industry. Shao Shenpei and Zheng Rongjing of Wuxian Silk Industry, Zirong and Haiquan, Zhu Ruifang and Ting Ji of Wuxi Silk Industry, Jiang Shangwu and Sun Youguang of Wujin Silk Industry, Zhou Wenbo of Yi Silk Industry, jointly knock on the truth.</p>

They broke into the house and ordered Guo's wife to open the door of the room. They then climbed up the roof and shouted for help.

<h3>Sun Discusses the International Impact After the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Russia; Li Liejun and Others Will Not Attend the Third Plenary Session; Volunteer Army Support Association Suggests Armed Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Sun Ke, along with Shanghai-based Central Executive Committee members Ma Chaojun, Chen Ce, Zeng Yangfu, Supervisory Committee member Yang Hu, alternate Central Executive Committee member Xian, alternate Supervisory Committee member Yun Chao, and Sun's secretary Chen Jianru, boarded two specially attached carriages of a special express train at 9:25 yesterday morning to go to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session. Central Executive Committee member Wu Chao, along with alternate Supervisory Committee member Feng Qingyang, took a train to Beijing at 3:50 yesterday afternoon. This reporter interviewed Sun on the train yesterday morning. According to Sun, the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia has always been his advocacy. After its realization this time, there will be changes in international diplomacy, and it may also accelerate the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between Russia and Japan. As for the Sino-Japanese issue, the League of Nations, with England favoring Japan, is unlikely to achieve a satisfactory result. In the future, China can only actively contact the United States and Russia to seek diplomatic sanctions, while rectifying its own strength to make considerable preparations. When asked by the reporter whether there was any recent news of Chen Youren returning to China, Sun replied that there was no news.</p>
<h3>Li Liejun's Telegram</h3>
<p>Li Liejun, Bo Wenwei, Xue Dubi, and others will not attend. Li sent a telegram to the Third Plenary Session yesterday, saying: "To the Third Plenary Session, for years I have assisted but have been unable to remedy the situation, and because the people have no way to fully utilize their intelligence, today's dangerous situation has been formed. Looking ahead, I am filled with sorrow. Liejun has been ill for many years and his body is getting weaker. I cannot bear the arduous journey and will not be able to attend the meeting. I hereby send this telegram." Li Liejun bows.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhi-ben's Letter</h3>
<p>The Mayor of Nanjing, Shi Ying, recently sent a letter to Committee Member Zhang Zhiben, urging him to go to Beijing to attend the meeting. The following is Zhang's reply to Shi: "Brother Hengqing, I received your kind letter and am ashamed that I cannot fulfill my promise to sweep the couch and welcome you. Your sentiments are sincere and earnest, and I am deeply grateful. I previously went to Hainan due to some matters, stayed there briefly, and then returned to Shanghai. The Third Plenary Session is of utmost importance to the national economy and people's livelihood, and I would very much like to go to the capital to meet with friends and reaffirm the meaning of resisting national crisis from the Second Plenary Session. However, I caught a cold on the way, and my toothache worsened. I forced myself to follow the doctor's advice, closed my door to visitors, and only drank porridge every day. My body is extremely tired, so although I have the will to travel, I lack the strength to endure the journey. Previously, when the enemy arrived in Shanghai, I endured and did not 'ride a horse to see the flowers of Luoyang.' Now, due to illness, I cannot 'stop the carriage to drink the water of Jianye.' I am deeply grateful for your kind advice and encouragement, but things have gone against my wishes, which only increases my shame and trepidation. I am sending this reply and wishing you well." Your brother Zhiben bows.</p>
<h3>Support Association's Telegram</h3>
<p>The Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association yesterday suggested to the Third Plenary Session to resist Japan by force and recover the lost territories in the Northeast. The following is the original text: "To the entire members of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party's Third Plenary Session, the members of this association, based on the position of supporting the Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army, have the following suggestions that must be made to your session, and we hereby present a summary as follows: (A) It is appropriate to declare a break in relations with Japan and prepare for armed resistance against Japan with a national mobilization. (Explanation) Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese imperialists have forcibly occupied our three northeastern provinces. We have not resisted. During the January 28th Incident, the Japanese imperialists used unprovoked artillery fire to destroy our Shanghai. Our government has been generous and has not resisted. The reason for enduring again and again is that we do not want Sino-Japanese relations to rupture quickly and violate international peace treaties, even if it means bearing the great disapproval of the world. We still have hope in the League of Nations' investigation report, which should be fair and impartial, and the League of Nations meeting, which should advocate justice and maintain world peace. However, the League of Nations' investigation report has already been published to the world. The League of Nations meeting has already been held in Geneva. The content of the report has already favored the Japanese, and the meeting's situation has not shown any fair resolution. It is clear that the League of Nations cannot advocate justice and maintain world peace. The Japanese government's obstinacy, willing to break international peace and instigate a second world war, is even more undisguised. If our government continues to act with the benevolence of a woman and make a pact of surrender, constantly retreating without urgently seeking self-rescue, the disaster of national subjugation will occur. Even if Korea and India are not seen in the Central Plains, the Boxer Protocol and the Treaty of 1901 will inevitably be repeated today. At that time, gentlemen of our government, what will you say to the people of the country given your responsibilities, and what will you say to the late Premier in response to his will to abolish all unequal treaties? Therefore, the members of this association, thinking of this, are terrified. After repeated discussions, we all believe that the brutal Japanese have already disregarded justice and acted recklessly, so there is nothing friendly to say. The international community, which we trusted in the past, is biased and cannot guarantee justice, so there is no hope. Our government, based on the spirit of revolution, should resolutely declare a break in relations with Japan and prepare for national mobilization, making the entire Chinese nation into an armed populace, enriching combat power, and acting as a backing for the government to resist the Japanese imperialists in order to maintain world peace. This is the first reason why this association must make this suggestion. (B) It is appropriate to quickly enrich the combat power of the border troops on the Rehe-Liaoning border, consolidate the existing defense line, and act as a vanguard for recovering the lost territories in the Northeast. (Explanation) Since Su Bingwen's retreat, the volunteer army outside the customs has felt hopeless about the responsibility of recovering the lost territories. The brutal Japanese imperialists are actively pressing on Rehe with the military power used to seize Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. Their intention is nothing more than because Rehe has Liaoning to the east, Heilongjiang to the northeast, Outer Mongolia to the north, Chahar to the west, and Hebei to the south. If Rehe is obtained, it will be easier to recover Liaoning and Heilongjiang. The land of Outer Mongolia will naturally become a single piece, and it will not be difficult to seize Chahar. Hebei will also be easier to seize. If Hebei is obtained, the entire North China will inevitably be shaken. Then, on the one hand, they will support Puyi's restoration and occupy Peiping, using the original name of the Qing Dynasty to regain its original international status. On the other hand, they will use the navy to pressure our Yangtze River basin, repeating the story of destroying Shanghai, in order to coerce us. Relying on Puyi's disturbances in the north and the threat of a strong enemy in the south, our government will be attacked from both sides, and even if it does not want to form an alliance under the city, it may be difficult to surrender. Therefore, the members of this association believe that before national mobilization, while Rehe has not been seized, we should quickly provide assistance and replenishment to the volunteer army on the Liaoning border who are fighting hard, and must enhance their combat power so that they can maintain their existing positions and wait for national mobilization, and they can act as the vanguard for recovering the lost territories in the Northeast. The volunteer army on the Rehe-Liaoning border can truly coexist with Rehe, North China, and the entire China. This is the second reason why this association must make this suggestion. Gentlemen of your session, all are enlightened individuals. We respectfully hope that you will include our humble contribution in the agenda and submit it to a vote. We eagerly await your decision. We respectfully submit this and wish you well." Standing Committee Members of the Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association: Li Denghui, Wang Hanliang, Wu Zhihao, Huang Jianzhong, Zhang Zilian, Zhang Juansheng, Cai Guoliang, Wang Zhisheng, Yan Qingmu, Xiao Enzhi, Liu Yuzhou.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Anti-Japanese Armies in the Northeast Telegraph the League of Nations General Assembly</h3>
<p>Requesting a just and fair ruling</p>
<p>The United Shanghai Liaison Office of the Anti-Japanese Armies in the Northeast telegraphed the Geneva League of Nations General Assembly yesterday, saying: "To Dr. Gu Weijun in Geneva, translated and forwarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nanjing National Government, and forwarded to the League of Nations General Assembly, the formation of Manchukuo was not a self-determination by the 30 million people of the three northeastern provinces, but rather manipulation by Japanese officials and soldiers. This has been detailed in the Lytton Report. Recently, public opinion has been fabricated, and more than 3,000 letters have been fabricated stating that local people requesting independence have been directly sent to Geneva in order to create excuses for the altar and deceive themselves and others, losing all international credibility. Since the September 18th Incident, the people of the three northeastern provinces have sworn to oppose the pseudo-organization under the protection of Japan and have gone to the country to fight. The generals Ma Zhanshan, Li Du, Ding Chao, Wang Delin, and Su Bingwen led more than 400,000 armed people, occupying more than 100 cities. After ten months of hard fighting, Japan sent more than nine regiments, which showed the enthusiasm of the people of the three provinces for embracing their motherland and the growing momentum of opposing the pseudo-organization. More than 58,000 people have sacrificed in the hands of the Japanese, but they have fallen and been succeeded, continuing their efforts with a spirit that swallows mountains and rivers, vowing to coexist with China. We hereby solemnly declare that the 30 million people of our three northeastern provinces vow to never recognize Manchukuo and are determined to overthrow it by extraordinary means, and this determination will never change until the seas run dry and the rocks crumble. We hope that the General Assembly will give a just and fair ruling so that world peace will not be trampled on by the violent. Liu Piguang, Wang Ziyao, Zhang Chuyu, Liang Detang, Xia Tengfei, Duan Zhongpan, Cao Fengchun, Yang Yijie, Li Shiyong, Zhang Youchun, He Guozhen, Pang Taifeng, and other representatives of the Anti-Japanese Armies in the Northeast bow.</p>
<p>Duan Zhongpan, the chief of the military law office of General Ma Zhanshan, Xia Tengfei, the chief of staff of Feng Zhanhai, Liang Detang, the representative of Wang Delin, and Wu Huanzhang, the former representative of General Ma Zhanshan, came to Shanghai together yesterday morning. Chu Huiseng, Li Cishan, Feng Shaoshan, and other standing directors of the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association hosted a banquet for them at the Gongdelin Vegetable Society on Parker Road at 6 pm last night.</p>
<h3>Ding and Li Jointly Telegraph the National Government to Report Half a Month of Battle Conditions</h3>
<p>The massacre on the Fujin front incited Koreans to burn government buildings</p>
<p>The United Shanghai Liaison Office of the Anti-Japanese Armies in the Northeast yesterday copied and distributed Ding Chao and Li Du's recent urgent telegram to the National Government and others, reporting military information, with the original text as follows: "Most urgent. To Chairman Jiang of the Nanjing National Government, Deputy Commander Zhang of Peiping, the Peiping Political Affairs Committee, the Military Committee, and Representatives Yan, Gu, and Guo in Geneva, since the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly, more than a month has passed and the Japanese are still advancing their troops on all sides, engaging in their aggression. We hereby report the battle conditions within the past half month as follows: On the 30th of last month, the Japanese stationed in Fujin attacked our Baoqing. The enemy troops numbered about 1,000, using armored vehicles, airplanes, and artillery to launch a fierce attack. Our Army Commander Sun Guangjia, seeing that the enemy's momentum was great, immediately led his troops to withdraw from the county seat and set up ambushes in Qixinghe and Yuanbaoshan, launching a sudden attack when the enemy was unprepared. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Japanese Commander Kobama and artillery staff officer Koyama were both seriously injured. The enemy retreated to Fujin, and our army re-entered Baoqing. The Japanese incited Koreans to set fire to more than 100 government buildings. On the 7th of this month, two Japanese aircraft dropped leaflets over Jiuzhan, along the China Eastern Railway, where our left-wing army was stationed, threatening our army to bomb them out of their positions. According to our right-wing report, on the 6th of this month, the Japanese dispatched more than 50 armored vehicles from Harbin to the YanShou Pearl River County, intending to advance eastward. Amidst this international conference, both sides should wait quietly for a solution, but the Japanese still have insatiable ambitions and continue to invade, showing their contempt for the League of Nations, disregard for morality, violation of public covenants, and destruction of world peace, with their sinister actions showing no scruples. Please forward this telegram to the League of Nations General Assembly, submit it for public resolution, strictly prohibit it, and let all countries know the truth of its actions in the Northeast in order to uphold justice and achieve the effect of mediation. We respectfully submit this telegram and beg for your consideration." Chairman of Jilin Province Ding Chao, Commander of the Northeast Border Defense Army stationed in Jilin Li bows.</p>

The company's first test flight was obstructed, and the second test flight was successful. It is now scheduled to officially open today, but only flies to Dihua.</p>
<h3>Shanghai and Peiping Fly Together</h3>
<p>The reporter inquired from the company yesterday and learned that the Euro-Asia Airlines will open the Peiping-Shanghai to Dihua route today.

At the same time, a W33 aircraft will also fly out of Peiping, piloted by pilot Luz. The two aircraft will arrive in Luoyang on the same day, and the next day, only the FI3 aircraft will fly directly to Dihua. As for the Russian airline, it has already been opened, and now that the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia has been realized, it will be easier to achieve Euro-Asia通航 in the future.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Flight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the company's scheduled flight plan was as follows: On the 15th, one plane each flew from Peiping and Shanghai to Luoyang; on the 16th, they flew from Luoyang to Suzhou; on the 17th, they flew from Suzhou to Dihua; on the 20th, they flew back from Dihua to Xi'an; on the 21st, they flew from Xi'an to Luoyang; and on the 23rd, they returned to Shanghai and Peiping separately.</p>
<h3>Distributing Leaflets</h3>

<h3>The Chongqing Aircraft of China National Aviation Corporation Was Burned</h3>
<p>The incident occurred at night and there were no casualties. Nie Kaiyi flew from Shanghai to Hankou yesterday to investigate</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the Chongqing aircraft, which runs between Shanghai and Chongqing, was suddenly burned on the river surface of Hankou a few days ago. Fortunately, the incident occurred at night and there were no casualties. Upon receiving the news, the Shanghai headquarters dispatched Nie Kaiyi, the director of the Aircraft Maintenance Group, to Hankou yesterday morning to investigate. The following is a record of the details:</p>
<h3>Sudden Combustion</h3>
<p>The Chongqing aircraft runs between Shanghai and Chongqing. Recently, the aircraft was docked at the Hankou Water Airport. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, the company sent a handyman to board the aircraft with a sampan to clean it. After about an hour, the handyman finished his work and saw that the lights inside the aircraft were still on, so he went inside to turn them off and left the aircraft to go ashore. At around 6 pm, the aircraft suddenly caught fire and quickly spread throughout the aircraft. By the time the company received the news and sent people to rescue it, the aircraft had been completely burned down. The next day, the handyman was detained for interrogation. The director of the Hankou office of China National Aviation Corporation, Zhu, telegraphed the chairman of the Shanghai headquarters about the incident for verification.</p>
<h3>Mr. Nie Flies to Hankou</h3>
<p>The chairman, upon receiving the report, immediately requested the director of the company's Maintenance Group, Nie Kaiyi, to go to Hankou to survey and investigate. Mr. Nie obeyed the order and flew to Hankou on the company's aircraft yesterday morning. At 2 pm, he had arrived in Hankou. According to the company's news yesterday, Mr. Nie may return to Shanghai today. The truth about the sudden combustion of the aircraft will be clear after Mr. Nie arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Aircraft is Insured</h3>
<p>The Chongqing aircraft is one of the largest aircraft of China National Aviation Corporation and can carry 12 passengers. It was manufactured in the United States and has been flying for only a year or so. It is valued at 125,000 yuan. Fortunately, it was insured in advance, so the company did not suffer any huge losses, except for the investigation of the cause of the combustion, and there were no casualties.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Anti-War Association Petition the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Please resolve to end internal strife and unite against external aggression; Please resolve to send senior officials to investigate Liu Xiang</p>

<h3>The Attack Began After Sailing Out of Wusongkou</h3>
<p>When the steamer sailed out of Wusongkou at 4 am, all the crew and passengers were snoring in their sleep. The bandits suddenly jumped up among the passengers, totaling twelve people. Eight people were holding handguns. Two bandits went to the navigation room (i.e., the pilothouse), pulled out handguns, and forced the pilot to sail east, or else they would be killed. The pilot, seeing the situation, knew it was a robbery and replied that he was not familiar with any other routes except this one. The two bandits ordered him to leave and drove the ship themselves, heading straight towards the East China Sea.</p>
<h3>Money and Belongings Were Emptied</h3>
<p>The steamer was forced to sail to the East China Sea, and the remaining bandits went to the ticket and cargo offices, forced open the iron boxes, and took all the silver dollars. They also robbed each passenger of all their silver dollars and valuable clothes, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<h3>The Bandits Fled to Baishan</h3>
<p>While the robbery was taking place, the steamer continued to sail east. By about 10 am, the entire ship had been searched. Fortunately, the cargo and passengers in the cargo hold were not touched at all. At this time, they had reached the vicinity of Baishan, which is about seventy or eighty miles away from Wusong. The steamer slowed down, and the bandits hired two small fishing boats on the sea, disembarked one after another, and fled to Baishan.</p>
<h3>The Ship Still Sailed Back to Tongzhou</h3>
<p>The shipowner, Xu Baogen, dared to inspect one by one after seeing that the bandits had carried the loot far away. Although all the employees and passengers on the ship were robbed, fortunately, none were injured, so they turned back to the Yangtze River. Because there was no shortage of cargo and passengers, they did not come to Shanghai but continued to sail upstream to Tongzhou.</p>
<h3>Sent Staff to Shanghai to Report</h3>
<p>The shipowner, seeing that there were many cargo and passengers, ordered the pilot to continue sailing to Tongyang. When passing Wusong at 11 pm that afternoon, they only sent crew members to Shanghai to report the robbery. The crew members landed in Wusong and stayed overnight in Song because there was no car to take. They came to Shanghai yesterday morning to report the robbery.</p>
<h3>Passengers and Cargo Were Completely Untouched</h3>
<p>The ship had more than 100 employees and carried more than 600 passengers that day. The bandits only took cash and valuables, and did not take heavy objects. Two passengers asked for their overcoats to be returned after being robbed because the weather was cold, and the bandits immediately threw them back. Therefore, the passengers and cargo on the ship were completely untouched. After investigation, the estimated loss was more than 8,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Company Will Take Measures to Deal with the Aftermath</h3>
<p>Although the company received news of the Hongda steamer being robbed that day, there were no detailed reports, so they could not take any action to rescue it. After receiving the ship's report yesterday morning, they learned that although it had been searched, the passengers and cargo were untouched, and the ship was not damaged, which was a blessing in misfortune. In order to prevent the same thing from happening again in the future and to ensure the safety of passengers, the company immediately requested the Water Patrol Team to send police to search the ship before it set sail every night to be cautious and avoid a repeat of the past.</p>
<h3>Submitted to the Water Patrol Team for Protection</h3>
<p>The document submitted to the Water Patrol Team yesterday reads: "Respected Sir, regarding the robbery of our company's Hongda steamer, according to the report from the ship's staff who returned to Shanghai, the ship set sail from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 12th of this month. When it sailed out of Wusongkou, it was already 4 o'clock, and all the crew and passengers were sound asleep. Suddenly, two bandits came out from the passage, each holding a handgun, and threatening them not to make a sound, and forced the pilot to turn the ship east, or they would be killed. The pilot replied that he was not familiar with other routes except this one, so the two bandits drove the ship themselves, heading straight east. Presumably, these bandits have been robbing for many years and are as familiar with the route as an old horse. At that time, the remaining bandits took out their weapons and went to the cargo and ticket offices, forced them to open the iron boxes, and robbed all the silver dollars. They also searched each employee and passenger for silver dollars and clothes, leaving no one unharmed. When the clock struck ten, the ship arrived at Baishan. The bandits hired several fishing boats and left with their loot. After investigation, the losses of the ship's office, employees, and passengers totaled about 8,000 yuan. It was also said that there were about 600 passengers on the Hongda steamer that day, and the bandits had mixed in with the passengers and pre-hidden on the ship. It is customary for our company's ships to set sail every midnight. At this time of the year, when there are many passengers, it is inevitable that bandits will mix in with them. Our company's Hongda steamer has suffered this robbery and suffered no small loss. All the ships have become frightened, and the passengers will inevitably warn each other not to travel and worry about repeating the same mistake. We are eager to plan properly for the aftermath, and we hereby request your team to send five or six police officers every night from now on to conduct a check on each passenger before boarding the ship to see if there are any suspicious people or people carrying weapons or contraband, and detain them and deal with them at any time in order to maintain the shipping business and the safety of travelers. We are very eager to wait for your orders." To Captain Zhu of the Water Patrol Team, Datong Renji Shipping Company, December 14.</p>
<h3>Arrived in Tongzhou and Sailed to Yangzhou Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Nantong, 14th telegram, the Hongda Steamer was robbed at sea by more than ten bandits in Song and robbed of more than 30,000 yuan before being released. Arrived in Tongzhou yesterday afternoon and continued sailing to Yangzhou.</p>
<h3>Issuance of Reconstruction Bonds Postponed; Municipal Government to Form Custodial Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government's disaster area reconstruction bonds of $6 million, underwritten by the British firm Liddell Bros. &amp; Co., originally scheduled for issuance today at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), have been postponed to the 21st of this month due to incomplete procedures. The bonds will be sold in full during banking hours at HSBC. According to the underwriting contract between the Municipal Government and Liddell Bros. &amp; Co., payment will be made at 80% of the face value. Liddell Bros. &amp; Co. is expected to deliver $4.8 million in cash soon. The remaining $1.2 million will be raised through other means by the Municipal Government. Rumors that Liddell Bros. &amp; Co. has already sold $4 million of the bonds abroad and will continue to sell the remaining $2 million at HSBC are inaccurate. As for the bond proceeds, the Municipal Government will form a fund custodial committee composed of one representative each from the Ministry of Finance, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai Banking Association, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and Liddell Bros. &amp; Co., the underwriter of the bonds. The Municipal Government has issued notices to the aforementioned organizations, scheduling the inaugural meeting for 3 PM on the 16th of this month at the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Banking Association by Banking Sector</h3>
<p>Dedicated to the Study of Banking Science</p>
<p>Fifteen Directors Elected, Including Xu Xinliu</p>
<p>The banking industry in China has progressed rapidly in the thirty years since its inception. Recently, banking leaders Hu Mengjia, Wu Dingchang, Xu Ji, Bei Songsun, Zhang Gongquan, Li Fusun, and Xu Xinliu, among others, noted that while banking trade associations have been established in various regions for banking business matters, there was a lack of corresponding organizations for the study of banking science. Therefore, they initiated the establishment of a banking association to promote the study of banking science in the domestic banking sector, cultivate practical banking talent, and conduct research, supplementary education, lectures, and library services. The association held its inaugural meeting the other day at the Shanghai Banking Association at 4 Hong Kong Road, passed its charter, elected directors, and officially announced its establishment. The list of directors is as follows: First Session of the Banking Association Board of Directors: Xu Xinliu, Wang Zhixin, Zhang Naiqi, Jin Lüqin, Cai Chengxin, Chen Jian'an, Yang Jiemei, Wu Daquan, Liu Siye, Bian Baimei, Shi Boqun, Gu Jigaog, Shen Laiqing, Yang Shihu, Pu Xinya, and fifteen others.</p>
<h3>Charity Carnival to Aid Refugees Postponed to the 18th</h3>
<p>Due to the Grand Scale of the Interior Decoration Not Being Completed in Time</p>
<p>A Solemn Archway Constructed Outside the Entrance to the Venue</p>
<p>The charity carnival to aid refugees from the Northeast, jointly organized by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Lawyers Association, and the Accountants Association, originally scheduled to open today, has been postponed to the 18th due to the grand scale of the interior decoration and time-consuming arrangements. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Postponement of Opening The opening of the carnival, originally scheduled for today, has been postponed to the 18th due to the time required for the various arrangements. Chairman Wang Xiaolai inspected the venue yesterday and expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. It is also reported that Dr. Xi Shitai has volunteered to provide medical services for the carnival.</p>
<p>Completion of Painting Exhibition To expand publicity and inspire national patriotism, the carnival commissioned the Shanghai Art College to create a small exhibition of paintings depicting the Northeast. More than thirty students from the college worked tirelessly to complete the exhibition, which is located on the third floor of the New World entertainment complex. The paintings depict refugees from the Northeast fighting bravely under the threat of enemy aircraft and artillery, holding their incomplete firearms and charging into close combat. The scene is filled with smoke, flying bullets, and a desolate atmosphere. The paintings vividly depict the difficult conditions of the righteous people fighting, moving gods and spirits to tears. Other propaganda paintings and plaster statues depict the suffering of refugees under the invasion of the enemy, with severed limbs, broken legs, and exposed brains and intestines, creating a shocking and terrifying effect. It is hoped that after viewing these paintings, the Chinese people will become more alert.</p>
<p>Floral Industry's Righteous Act The Floral and Tree Industry Association, in order to participate in the charity carnival, announced a flower planting competition among its members, displaying rare and exotic flowers and creating exquisite flower baskets. The display is a grand spectacle, unprecedented in Shanghai. The association has already arranged for craftsmen to begin decorating the venue and constructing a flower archway at the entrance. According to the person in charge, the design of the archway is unique, solemn, beautiful, and unparalleled, an unprecedented creation.</p>
<p>Vocational Education for National Salvation The China Vocational Education Society has displayed various handicrafts and posted slogans promoting vocational education for national salvation at the New World venue, in order to raise awareness of the importance of vocational education for national salvation.</p>
<h3>Employees of China Merchants North Station Refuse to Hand Over Operations</h3>
<p>All Employees Resign and Petition the Authorities; Union Organizes Petition Seeking Assistance</p>
<p>All employees of the China Merchants North Station opposed He Tiehua's return as the station manager. The union petitioned the general manager and board of directors to withdraw the appointment. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the new station manager arrived at the station to take office, protected by Chinese and foreign detectives, which led to all employees leaving the station and refusing to hand over operations, creating a serious situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Taking Office Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Huishan Police Station received a notice from the China Merchants Bureau and dispatched armed Chinese and foreign detectives to the China Merchants North Station on Broadway Road. At 10:00 AM, the newly appointed station manager, He Tiehua, accompanied by Huang Xuchu, a commissioner from the general bureau overseeing the handover, arrived at the station by car to take office. The second notice stated that all employees willing to serve under the new management should report to the office and sign in today before noon, otherwise they would be considered to have voluntarily abandoned their positions.</p>
<p>Refusal to Hand Over After the new station manager arrived at the station, the acting station manager, Li Nai'an, was absent. He summoned the cargo superintendent, Yun Boling, to hand over operations. Yun replied that the former station manager, Wu Shuping, had not instructed him to handle the handover, and politely refused. At the same time, all employees, alarmed by He Tiehua's forceful takeover, convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. They decided to resist the forceful oppression and resolved to: (1) refuse to hand over anything; (2) all resign and report to the union at the Jinliyuan Wharf and Fifth Wharf. The detectives stationed at the station monitored the employees and prohibited them from leaving. However, thirteen employees, including Wu Fuchang, Ai Sheng, Liu Changfa, He Zhide, Sheng Chanchen, Jiang Chengzong, Zhang Jinshan, Huang Zengle, Yuan Xinwan, teaboy Lu Jiulin, Shi Qixiang, and gateman Qi Daquan, Wu Shaopo, signed a statement declaring their obedience to the new station manager.</p>
<p>Collective Petition After leaving the North Station, all employees reported to the union council. At 2:00 PM, the council, together with all employees, traveled by truck to the party and government agencies to petition. Zhang Risheng, the chief secretary of the civil training section of the municipal party headquarters, and Tan Peiyan of the third section of the Social Affairs Bureau, received them and promised to send officials to investigate.</p>
<p>Impact on Passengers and Cargo The North Station has a total of seventy-nine staff members and over two thousand laborers. Since the employees left the station, the new station manager, He Tiehua, has been unable to take over. In the afternoon, the cargo warehouses were closed due to the absence of supervisors, causing a complete standstill in the loading and unloading of passengers and cargo.</p>
<p>Visit to the General Manager At 5:00 PM, the new North Station manager, He Tiehua, accompanied by the overseeing commissioner Huang Xuchu, returned to the general bureau to visit the general manager, Liu Hongsheng, to report on the situation and request instructions on how to proceed. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited the general manager at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon. According to the general manager, the appointment of He Tiehua as the North Station manager was decided by the board of directors. He stated that the bureau would find ways to maintain passenger and cargo operations despite the employees' departure and hoped that the employees would understand that the China Merchants Bureau is a national shipping agency and resume their work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Record of the Eurasia Corporation Shareholders' Meeting; Li Jingcong Appointed General Manager</h3>
<p>Riri News Agency reports that Mr. Wang Zhiyuan, Deputy Chairman and General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, has resigned due to heavy workload. The company convened a special</p>
<p>Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday (the 14th) at 5:30 PM to elect Li Jingcong and Shen Yamin as directors. Li suggested that although the previous shareholders' meeting had decided to cancel the Operations Department and retain the Finance and Mechanical Departments in order to reduce expenses due to poor business conditions, he believed that the company was a business transportation organization and that the Finance Department should be part of the Operations Department. He suggested that the Finance Department be canceled and the Operations Department be restored, which was deemed more appropriate. This was unanimously approved, and then a</p>
<p>Board of Directors Meeting was held, and Li Jingcong was elected as Deputy Chairman and General Manager. All the directors applauded. Li then immediately appointed Shen Yamin as the Director of the Operations Department. Li further stated that although the former General Manager Wang had only been in office for six months, he had worked hard to maintain the business during a time of national crisis. He believed that the company should follow the shareholders' meeting's proposal to give Wang a month's salary and also present him with a silver cup as a token of appreciation, which was unanimously agreed upon. Li also suggested that the company's</p>
<p>Northwest Route, originally scheduled to fly from Shanghai directly to Tacheng on the Sino-Russian border in Xinjiang, would be more economical if it flew from Nanjing. (1) Domestic mail from Shanghai to Nanjing is originally transported by China National Aviation Corporation, and the company's planes have almost no mail to carry on this segment. (2) Since the resumption of the Beijing-Shanghai segment this summer, there has been almost no passengers because there is only one round-trip flight per week. (3) The company's planes cost about two yuan per kilometer to fly. If the Beijing-Shanghai segment is suspended, it can save at least 2,200 kilometers of flying per month, saving over 4,000 yuan in unnecessary expenses. Before business develops, it is necessary to temporarily suspend this segment of flight. It was unanimously agreed that the reasons were sufficient. The company resolved that starting next week (excluding the formal maiden voyage on the 15th which will still depart from Shanghai) the point of origination would be changed to Nanjing. Mr. Smith then reported on this test flight and all the preparations for the formal maiden voyage on the 15th. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Chongshan Hall Repatriates Loyal Remains</h3>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, the Chongshan Hall in Jiangwan organized a burial team to collect corpses. Due to the strict military orders of the enemy forces at the time, passage was obstructed. In addition to burying over four hundred bodies nearby in the three-hundred-mu Guangzhao Villa, there were still about six hundred bodies scattered in the people's fields. This winter, the team is moving those scattered in the people's fields to the Chongshan Hall public land at Changgou Bay, north of Jiangwan Town, to create a public cemetery for the January 28th Incident war dead. Chief Engineer Quan Yuanren has been assigned to design the drawings, plant trees, and erect a monument to commemorate the fallen. In addition, over one hundred bodies incinerated by enemy soldiers near the Houjiaben Bridge in the Twenty-sixth District will be reburied in the cemetery. Construction has already begun. The expenses are entirely borne by Mr. Wang Weiguan of the Delong Tobacco Company. Zhang Shanyu has been designated as the director. If there are any remains discarded in the fields within the district, they can be reported to the Chongshan Hall at the old site of the Jiangwan Township Office for immediate collection and burial.</p>
<h3>Measures for Receiving Silk Public Bonds from Factories</h3>
<p>Joint Office Opens on the 16th; Receiving Begins Before the 25th</p>
<p>All silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have shut down and are in dire straits. The Ministry of Industry specifically requested the Ministry of Finance and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to issue three million yuan in public bonds to assist the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and to organize two committees to sort out, promote the sale of aged silk and cocoons from factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It has been six months since the opening of the committees. Two-thirds of the silk factories have resumed production, and the sorting is completed, and half of the Ministry of Finance bonds can be issued within the month. Yesterday, Zhu Jing'an, chairman of the sorting committee, Shen Huachen, director of general affairs, and Bao Bingxian, chairman of the sales committee, executive committee members Wu Shenbo and Li Shuchu, and Run, chairman of the fund management committee, gathered to discuss the outcome of the meeting. The two committees jointly established a joint office in the yarn and cocoon general office of Beixiyuan Road. It was decided that the office would open tomorrow (the 16th). All those holding certificates for exporting old silk from factories and public amounts must apply to the office for bond certificates before the 25th, and then go to the fund management committee to receive the bonds. It is said that the first lottery drawing of the bonds will be held at the end of this month. All silk merchants are paying close attention.</p>
<h3>Report on the Completion of the Jianghan Dyke Project Survey</h3>
<p>To Inspect the Dike Projects of the Yi, Luo, and Sha Rivers</p>
<p>The Dyke Project Survey Team reported to Committee Chairman Song: Chairman Song of the Shanghai National Government's Flood Relief Committee, respectfully acknowledged. The team received two telegrams requesting inspection. The team traveled by car from Hankou to Yichang on the 10th, passing through Hanchuan, Yunluo, Yingcheng, Jingshan, and Tianmen Counties, etc. Buildings burned by bandits could be seen everywhere. Later, after the major army suppressed the bandits and the bandits were eliminated, the economy of the villages was restored, and the people were able to live and work in peace. On the 11th, they traveled downstream from Yuekou by speedboat. In the morning, they surveyed the dikes at Qinghuajin, Lijiazui, Zhoujiayue, Yangjiayue, and Baisha, etc. In the afternoon, they surveyed the dikes at Xiantao and Luosijing, etc. On the 12th, they surveyed the X溝 dike project. All the dikes renovated by the Eighth and Ninth District Engineering Relief Bureaus were one meter higher than the flood level last year. The work was well done. According to local sources, the Engineering Relief personnel entered the bandit areas despite the dangers, were abused and even killed, and finally succeeded in completing the project. Due to the low water level in winter, the small wheel boat we traveled on was repeatedly stranded in the middle of the journey, which took a lot of time. Therefore, we were unable to inspect the dikes above Yuekou one by one. We heard that the upstream of Yuekou was also severely affected by the disaster last year. Although it was included in the Engineering Relief scope, the area was occupied by bandits, making the situation dangerous. Only the breaches were barely repaired. Other projects, such as raising and strengthening the dikes, have not been completed. The unfinished projects of the various District Engineering Relief Bureaus are now being taken over by the Engineering Office of the National Economic Council. The unfinished projects above Yuekou have already been started. All the dikes in the Jianghan River Basin have been inspected. In addition to inspecting the Yi, Luo, and Sha River projects handled by the Eighth District Engineering Relief Bureau, we will first report for your examination. Sincerely, the entire Dyke Project Survey Team, Wen Lanting, Zhou Xiangxian, Li Zushen, Qian Hua, Lu Yi, Wu Renzhi, Zhu Yunguang, Pan Zeji, Chen Shizhang, Guo Wenfu, Wang Yinping, Stroebe Finoh, and others kowtowing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Commander Minai Inspects Relics of the Shanghai Battle Zone Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that Vice Admiral Minai, Commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy, departed from the Izumo warship at the Huishan Wharf at 9:15 AM yesterday. Those accompanying him included Commander Sugita of the Marine Corps, Commander Fujita of the Antaku warship, the commander of the 27th Destroyer Division, and over ten aides. The municipal government had received prior notification, so Yin Tixin and Li Qian of the Public Security Bureau were specially assigned as representatives to take care of everything. The police along the way were ordered to be on full alert to provide protection. Commander Minai and others first went to Baoshan Road to inspect the ruins of the destroyed Commercial Press, where Japanese staff officer Takeda explained the battle situation at that time. They then went to inspect Jiangwan and other places, returning to their unit at 12:00 PM. After lunch, they traveled in several cars at 1:00 PM to visit the battle sites in Wusong, Baoshan, and Zhaobang. They returned to the Izumo warship at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zihang, Commander of the Overseas Chinese Dare-to-Die Corps, Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Purpose is to Expand Organization and Request Assistance</p>
<p>Jiang Zihang and seven other members of the Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army passed through Shanghai on September 27th and headed north to fight the enemy. They arrived in Ping on October 1st. On the 7th, Zhang Mingwu, commander of the 26th Route Army of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, assigned a portion of his soldiers to be under his command, and it was named the Overseas Chinese Dare-to-Die Corps of the 26th Route Army of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army. Each of the overseas Chinese soldiers who went north was given an appropriate assignment. On the 19th, the entire corps was ordered to leave the country to work. Now Jiang Zihang has led Du Jingxiong, captain of the first detachment, Cen Fenshuo, captain of the second detachment, Chen Dingzhong, captain of the third detachment, and four others south from the Liaosui defense area. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday and are temporarily residing at the Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Countrymen Association at the intersection of Edwad Road and Tibet Road. It is heard that the purpose of Jiang and others' trip south is to expand the overseas Chinese anti-Japanese national salvation movement, expand the organization of the corps, strengthen its power, and request assistance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Nominates Representative to the Rent Dispute Committee</h3>
<p>The issue of the qualification of the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Government Construction Discussion Committee, who had previously been nominated to the Rent Dispute Committee of this city, had become an issue, due to the order to dissolve that particular committee. As a result, the Rent Dispute Committee had petitioned to revise its charter. The instructions recently received from the Shanghai government read: "For your information, we have checked with the committee's report to amend the second clause, third section of its charter, the one that assigned one representative from the Shanghai Municipal Government Construction Discussion Committee, to instead be one representative from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. After reporting the situation, the Executive Yuan approved the report in instruction number 3071, and has already reported to the National Government to be recorded, and has notified the Ministry of Interior." And so on. The Shanghai government then publicly announced that part of the charter had been amended, and ordered the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to designate a representative to the Rent Dispute Committee for approval. Now, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has reported, "The association has nominated Chairman Wang Xiaolai to be its representative attending the Rent Dispute Committee, in addition to sending a letter, and formally submits it for review." The Shanghai government has now sent instructions to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to take note.</p>

<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Orders Two Ferryboats</h3>
<p>To Start Operation in January Next Year</p>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau's plan to expand the city's ferry service has been actively undertaken by the bureau. The bureau has ordered two city ferryboats from the Hexing Manufacturing Factory, and the machinery has been purchased from the Qianxin Foreign Firm. The price is 120,000 yuan, and it is expected that the boats will be fully completed by mid-January next year, and will be able to start operating at the Tongren Wharf and the Edward Road intersection across the river by the end of January.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Orders All Industries to Prohibit the Use of Uncertified Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Since the unification of weights and measures was announced in July last year, various industries in this city have successively switched to the new system. When the inspection team of the Municipal Inspection Bureau conducted inspections, it was repeatedly discovered that the weights and measures used by various industries in the city, although marked as "municipal standard" or "municipal foot," did not have the inspection mark. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that the above situation is obviously a case of manufacturers evading inspection, or users deliberately defrauding, which violates the law and obstructs the administration of weights and measures. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce to forward the notice to all trade associations, ordering all members to take note and not to purchase or use weights and measures that have not been marked with the inspection mark. In the future, once discovered, whether it is intentional fraud or unintentional mispurchase, the law will be strictly enforced without leniency.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Handles Veterinary Applications for Ministry Certificates</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, following the city's Provisional Regulations for the Management of Veterinarians, had previously conducted two veterinarian registrations. Now, in accordance with the central government's promulgated Technician Registration Law, this registration falls under the animal husbandry and veterinary medicine category within the scope of agricultural technicians. All practicing veterinarians must first apply for a registration certificate from the Ministry of Industry and then have a practice certificate issued by the local government. The municipal government has already announced and implemented the regulations regarding the reporting of practice by technicians and associate technicians in this city. It is reported that the bureau has submitted a request to abolish the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Veterinarians in this city and has separately ordered all veterinarians to comply with the regulations and apply for ministry certificates.</p>
<h3>Songhu Railway Traffic Restored the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>At 5:08 PM the day before yesterday, at the Baoshan Road Station of the Songhu Railway, near gate number four, the 111th steam train suddenly crashed violently into the 585th small work train. Although no passengers or railway staff were killed or injured, the entire Songhu Railway line was blocked as a result.

<h3>Charity Race Funds to Relief Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Orders Five Bureaus to Coordinate Distribution Methods First</p>
<p>The city has suffered greatly from the impact of the January 28th Incident, with significant losses in the Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei districts. The Municipal Government, in order to seek relief and reconstruction, negotiated with the Shanghai and Songhu Rehabilitation Committee for an allocation of 250,000 yuan in relief funds and raised 6 million yuan in reconstruction public bonds. However, due to the vastness of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster, these funds are still insufficient. Therefore, the Municipal Government initiated an international charity horse race at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse to allocate the proceeds to the disaster victims in northern Shanghai. Yesterday, the Municipal Government ordered the Director of the Finance Bureau, Cai Zengji, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Xingya, the Director of the Education Bureau, Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Shen Yi, and the Director of the Health Bureau, Li Ting'an, to coordinate the distribution methods. The original text is recorded below for compliance: "Order concerning the case of raising funds for disaster relief in the war zone through horse racing, which has been resolved in the 222nd Municipal Council meeting, designating the use of funds for: 1. Loans to villagers in Jiangwan for house construction; 2. Subsidies for the repair of damaged hospitals in the war zone; 3. Subsidies for the repair of damaged schools in the war zone, to be coordinated and distributed by the five directors Cai, Wu, Pan, Shen, and Li, and reported to the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee, to be managed by Director Cai, etc. In addition to separate letters of order, the bureau director is hereby ordered to comply with this order."</p>
<h3>Fellow Villagers from Dongting Dongshan Discuss Opinions on Anti-Piracy on Inland Rivers</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government Sends a Telegram on Behalf of the People to Rescue Those Kidnapped</p>
<p>Zhu Xianhuai, Chairman of the Committee of the Association of Fellow Villagers from Dongting Dongshan in Shanghai, recently noted that cases of robbery and kidnapping on mountain ships have occurred repeatedly. This time, the Yutai Steamer was again hijacked, resulting in the injury and death of escorts and passengers, and the kidnapping of four people. This is truly shocking. In addition to seeking opinions from fellow villagers in Shanghai on anti-piracy and post-disaster measures, to be discussed and implemented at a meeting in two weeks, he also sent a quick mail telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs yesterday, which reads: "Respectfully presented, on the 9th of this month, the Laogong Maoyutai Steamer, sailing from Suzhou to Dongshan, at 4 PM, when traveling to Huangji Bay, was suddenly attacked by thirty to forty bandits, some with painted faces (presumably local ruffians, fearing recognition), holding weapons and firing guns, resisting the No. 4 patrol boat of the Eighth Water Police Team, injuring three water police officers, and stray bullets killing passengers Jiang Dinglu and Zhang Kunquan, injuring two others. Ultimately, the water police were outnumbered and the bandits boarded the ship, looting all the property and clothing of the passengers, and kidnapping four passengers. However, the area is adjacent to Dujie Village, where guerrillas are stationed. At the time, the police and bandits exchanged over a hundred shots. The team was nearby, so why did they not rescue upon hearing the alarm? Most of the people of Dongshan are engaged in commerce in other cities and must go to Suzhou to transfer. In recent years, major cases of robbery and kidnapping on ships have occurred repeatedly, causing travelers to be fearful and the future to be particularly dangerous. Now, according to the fellow villagers in Shanghai, who are requesting a solution to rescue the kidnapped persons, we specifically urge your superiors to strictly order their subordinates to investigate and handle the matter as a whole, and to quickly provide methods for post-disaster prevention to reassure the people and facilitate travel, and we await your orders with utmost urgency."</p>
<h3>Hu Baoyi, Gao Guizi, and Others Organize the Funeral for the Late Mr. Zhao Te</h3>
<p>The late Mr. Zhao Te of Pei County was renowned for his writings and scholarship. Speaking with him was gentle, but his works displayed a heroic spirit that could not be slighted. He once taught in both northern and southern China, and wherever he went, he gathered revolutionaries to engage in secret activities, repeatedly facing danger. During the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, he rose up enthusiastically and joined the army between Shandong and Hebei, enduring hardships and exploring the hardships of the people's livelihoods, hoping to alleviate them. Unfortunately, he died of lung disease in Peking last year. His upright spirit suddenly became a thing of the past, and his desolate grave in the wilderness only adds to the sorrow. His friends Hu Baoyi, Gao Guizi, Ling Menghen, Chen Bai, Guo Qingjie, Zhuo Hengzhi, He Tianfeng, Chen Yilang, Shao Hua, Zeng Guangfen, Sun Zhongji, and others, pity him and plan to raise funds to move his remains to the Wan'an Public Cemetery in Xiangshan, Peking, build a tomb, erect a monument, plant trees, and lay grass to comfort his spirit and maintain the friendship. They are also collecting his poems, letters, calligraphy, and paintings from his lifetime to publish a special collection to be circulated. (Donations can be sent to Sun Zhongtao at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank in Peking for collection and storage. His works and photographs can be sent to Ling Menghen at Nanjing Central University.)</p>
<h3>Someone Throws a Bomb at the Yonghua Company</h3>
<p>At 6:15 PM last night, someone suddenly threw a bomb at the entrance of the Yonghua Department Store at No. 428 Avenue Edward VII, the corner of Eight Mile Bridge Street, destroying a large glass window on the west side. The woolens displayed inside the window suffered minor damage, and no one was injured. Afterwards, the Great Bell Clock Police Station sent detectives to investigate. They questioned nearby shops, who all said that it was the beginning of the evening lights and the pedestrians were dense, so no one noticed the bomber.</p>
<h3>Electrical Industry Profiteers Vigorously Selling Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>The National Goods Maintenance Association Sent a Letter to the Industry Association Yesterday to Advise Them</p>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, the China National Goods Maintenance Association recently received a confidential report that six electrical appliance companies have recently been vigorously selling enemy goods, especially light bulbs. Yesterday, it specifically sent a letter to the industry association, asking them to forward it to the relevant companies, urging them to stop selling them as soon as possible. The original letter reads: "To whom it may concern, we have recently received a confidential report stating that electrical appliance companies (names temporarily confidential) have been vigorously selling enemy goods, including light bulbs and other electrical appliances, with light bulbs being the most numerous, causing the market to be flooded with enemy bulbs, prices are low, and they are being dumped on the market. Please pay attention to this matter. Upon receiving this report, we have found that at this time of national crisis, which is intensifying, with the imminent danger of national and family collapse, all Chinese people are indignant at the Japanese people's violent aggression, forcible occupation of our three northeastern provinces, invasion of Shanghai and Songhu, and recent plans to invade Rehe and disrupt northern China, in order to achieve their ambition of destroying our country. With such deep hatred that cannot be shared under the same sky, how should the whole country unite to resist enemy goods and resolutely engage in economic severance with them, and act as a backing for our country? Yet there are still such unscrupulous merchants who, seeing profit and disregarding righteousness, recklessly transport enemy goods. Is this not akin to selling out our ancestors and descendants? If this is true, would they not be utterly devoid of character? For the sake of the character of the entire industry, this association has issued an advisory at the 21st session of the 29th joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees. If they persist in their evil ways and continue to transport goods, they will be severely sanctioned and abandoned by the public. This letter is hereby sent for your information."</p>

<p>Yun Huifang's Appeal Case Concluded After Eloquent Arguments by Lawyers, Sentencing Scheduled for the 21st of This Month</p>
<h3>With Two Witnesses Providing Strong Evidence, Can Yun Huifang Be Deemed Innocent?</h3>
<p>Yun Huifang was previously detained by Huajie police for throwing a bomb at a shop privately selling enemy goods and transferred to the Second Special District District Court of the French Concession. Although she was sentenced to imprisonment, she was granted a suspended sentence because she was under the age of sixteen. However, the Public Concession Police Department believed that Yun was also involved in the case of Cai Yaozu throwing a bomb at the Yongchang Coal Company on Xinza Road, injuring employee Yu Ruiliang. Therefore, they jointly transferred her from the Second Special Court to the First Special District District Court and sentenced her to three months of imprisonment, reduced, for the crime of jointly using methods sufficient to cause death to injure a person. Yun was not satisfied with this and filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The court hearing was held on the 21st of last month, but Yun's lawyers presented several witnesses and requested that they be summoned for cross-examination, so the hearing was adjourned to await the arrival of the witnesses. This was previously reported. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continued public hearing of the case. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Temporary Hearing Tickets Issued by President Shen of the Second High Court</h3>
<p>President Shen Jiayi of the Second High Court, noting that the courtroom was always extremely crowded with attendees whenever Yun's case was heard, and that the seats in the courtroom were limited, with previous hearings being unrestricted, inevitably leading to disorder in the courtroom due to the excess of people over available seats, specially created a type of hearing ticket to maintain order in the courtroom. Anyone wishing to enter the courtroom to attend the hearing was required to obtain a ticket first, otherwise they would be barred from the courtroom. This method was an innovation in the court's history, so a notice was issued and posted on the court's door, which read: "Notice regarding the Yun Huifang appeal case of attempted murder, which is scheduled to be heard in the First Court at 1:00 PM on the 14th of this month. Due to the limited number of seats for attendees in the courtroom, in order to avoid disorder and crowding, special hearing tickets have been created, numbered according to all available seats in the courtroom, and issued. The issuance of tickets will stop when all seats are filled. Anyone wishing to attend the hearing must obtain a hearing ticket from the Judicial Police Room of this court; those without a ticket will not be allowed to enter. In addition to this, notices will be issued at any time for future cases where this hearing method is used. This notice is hereby issued for general knowledge."</p>
<h3>Security Measures Inside and Outside the Courtroom</h3>
<p>All gates, both main and side, leading to the First Court were temporarily closed at 1:00 PM by order of President Shen, and five or six armed bailiffs were stationed at each gate to strictly control access. Four Western police officers were stationed in a row in front of the main gate. Those entering the courtroom had to proceed through this gate, and absolutely no one was allowed to enter without a hearing ticket. As a result, no fewer than four or five hundred people, many of whom were male and female youths resembling students, stood by the western wall of the court waiting to receive hearing tickets. They eagerly slipped business cards through the windows to exchange for a hearing ticket. By two o'clock, all the tickets had been issued. Those who arrived later could only sigh in disappointment, while those holding tickets entered the courtroom in an orderly fashion, numbering approximately three hundred people. They were directed to their seats by court bailiffs, and the courtroom was immediately filled, maintaining order throughout and avoiding the disorder that had occurred in the past when there were no restrictions.</p>
<h3>List of Names of People Present in Court</h3>
<p>The appellant Yun Huifang arrived earliest. Yun was wearing a gray silk cotton robe, her hair styled in a Western fashion, and her face bore a smile. She first went to the lawyers' lounge to rest briefly before entering the First Court and sitting among the crowd. Witnesses Wang Jisheng and Wang Bujing arrived next. Xia Guoxin had already left Shanghai and returned to his hometown, and Yu Ruiliang, who was injured in the bombing, had recovered, but still did not comply with the summons to appear in court. Yun's defense lawyers Shen Junru, Zhao Chen, and Li Zuyu, the Public Concession lawyer Li Zhishan, and Chief Detective Zhao Bingkun, who handled the case, along with Western detectives, also arrived one after another around two o'clock.</p>
<h3>The Testimony of the Two Witnesses is the Same</h3>
<p>At 2:30 PM, Presiding Judge Yu Hua, along with Judges Zhao Zheng and Guo Pu, Prosecutor Zhong, and the court clerk, took their seats and began the hearing. First, Wang Jisheng, an employee of the Yinlou jewelry store at No. 721 Xinza Road, was called as a witness. Wang testified that his store was only two doors away from the Yongchang Coal Company. At a little after 6:00 AM that day, he was washing his face when he suddenly heard a loud noise. He went out to look and learned that the Yongchang Coal Company had been attacked by someone throwing a bomb. At that time, he saw someone running past, but only saw the person's back. The person's figure was taller than Yun's, and he had never seen Yun before. Wang Bujing, an employee of the rice store at No. 746 Xinza Road, testified that his store was diagonally opposite the Yongchang Coal Company. At the time, he was standing at the entrance of the store when he heard a loud noise. He immediately saw someone running past, who was taller than Yun. The bomb exploded in front of the Yongchang Coal Company, and Yu Ruiliang, who was standing inside the entrance of the Yongchang Coal Company, was injured in the buttocks. Because the injury was minor, Yu initially did not notice it and did not want to go to the hospital. However, after the police detectives arrived to investigate, they persuaded him to go to the hospital, but he returned to the store from the hospital that same day. He did not see the bomber. He only saw someone running after the explosion, so he suspected that person must have been the bomber. Chief Detective Zhao then re-reported the circumstances of handling the case and presented a drawing of Yun Huifang's actions of throwing a bomb at the scene, which was drawn after taking Yun Huifang to the scene and ordering her to demonstrate how she threw the bomb. The court then asked Yun if she had any opinions on the testimony of the two witnesses. Yun replied that she did not, and the court ordered the start of the arguments.</p>
<h3>Arguments of the Public Concession Lawyer</h3>
<p>First, the Public Concession lawyer Li Zhishan stood up and refuted Yun's reasons for appeal point by point, stating that the facts of the case had already been clearly investigated by the court. The defendant's reasons for appeal were nothing more than an attempt to mitigate her criminal liability. Allegations of impropriety in the original judgment were all [illegible characters] to fact and misinterpretations of the law, and should not be believed. Although the defendant's criminal behavior was motivated by patriotic sentiments, she should still be held legally responsible for injuring someone and should not be allowed to escape the law because of her patriotism. Furthermore, the confession she made at the police station had been signed by Yun herself, and this confession was not the result of coercion and corresponded to the facts investigated. The original judgment was justified in using it as a basis. Even if she now denies the confession, the facts should not be overturned. The behavior of the unscrupulous merchants was indeed abominable, such as providing the enemy with grain, etc., but there are national laws to punish them. Recently, Hu Lifu has already been convicted. However, the defendant has no right to arbitrarily punish unscrupulous merchants, and the state has not authorized the public to punish unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, the defendant's claim of self-defense is not appropriate. Compared with the case in the French Concession, although her criminal intent was the same, her criminal act and its result were different, so it cannot be considered a continuous offense. Recently, the police in another case captured a Pan Hongsheng and found a photograph of Yun and Cai Yaozu together, which suggests that Yun may also be suspected in that case. This [illegible character] is presented to the court for reference. In short, the defendant's only reason is that her patriotic actions should be viewed leniently by the judicial authorities. However, since she has already violated the law, she should be punished according to the law in order to comply with the spirit of the rule of law. Moreover, her appeal has no merit and should be rejected.</p>
<h3>Rebuttals of the Defendant's Lawyers</h3>
<p>Before the defendant's lawyers could rebut, the court questioned Yun Huifang again. According to Yun, she was in a state of extreme confusion when she confessed at the police station, so many of the things she said were untrue. She is actually sixteen years old and was born on December 14th. Her previous claim of being seventeen years old was also inaccurate. Then, lawyer Zhao Chen stood up to defend Yun, dividing his argument into four key points: 1. The subject of the crime is incorrect; 2. The object of the crime is questionable; 3. Whether there was any joint criminal act; 4. Whether the crime was intentional. Therefore, the crime under Article 294 of the original judgment could not be established. The appellant should be declared innocent, or the charges should be dismissed, or the crime should be considered a continuous offense. He pleaded for the court to uphold the spirit of judicial independence and render a fair judgment. Lawyer Shen Junru also stood up and argued eloquently. Finally, lawyer Li Zuyu spoke, saying that even if Yun went with Cai Yaozu, Yun was standing on the side of the road, and since the bomb was thrown by Cai, Yun should not be held responsible for jointly injuring someone. Moreover, her motive was patriotism. If she is guilty, she should be granted a suspended sentence. Prosecutor Zhong then stood up and gave a brief closing statement. The court adjourned and announced that the judgment would be delivered at 2:00 PM on the 21st of this month. It was already five o'clock.</p>
<h3>A Fire Breaks Out in a Abacus Shop Inside Xiaodongmen</h3>
<p>The Fire Spreads to the Adjoining Wang Kaifu Home</p>
<p>The Liu Yongtai abacus shop at No. 49 Wutong Street inside Xiaodongmen caught fire unexpectedly around 3:00 AM yesterday morning. In an instant, the fierce flames soared and burst through the roof. The Firefighting Association immediately sounded the alarm, and fire brigades from various districts drove pump trucks to the scene one after another, drawing water to extinguish the fire. The fire was extinguished after about an hour. As a result, in addition to the complete destruction of the shop's two-story building, the two-story building of the Wang Kaifu family from Ningbo, which was adjacent to the shop, was also affected. When the fire was raging, Kang Boya, the guard police officer from the 12th post in the area, arrived and took Liu Tongzhang, the shop owner, to the Second Precinct of the First District. During the preliminary interrogation, Precinct Chief Liu Tongzhang stated that he was 24 years old, from Yangzhou, and his father's name was Liu Zhengjing. The fire may have been caused by a short circuit. It was found that the shop had fire insurance of 1,500 taels. The cause of the fire was unknown, so the police were dispatched to thoroughly investigate the truth of the fire. Liu was then sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>

Team 1, Captain Pan Gongzhan, did not contribute this period, with 1,125 points from the previous period. 7. Team 10, Captain Wang Xiaolai, did not contribute in the previous period, but contributed 1,000 points this period, with a bonus of 50 points, totaling 1,050 points. 8. Team 6, Zhong Ketuo, did not contribute this period, with 1,000 points from the previous period. 9. Team 8, Captain Cao Yunxiang, had 750 points from the previous period and did not contribute this period. The total score is 16,954 points. It is reported that the date for the third announcement is the 21st of the month, and the closing ceremony will be on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Yongyi Cigarette Factory Investigated for Tax Evasion</h3>
<p>Deng Gen, Western Detective Chief of the Special Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Shanghai, and Liang Baosheng, Chinese Detective, etc., went to various cigarette factories in the concession on the morning of the 6th of this month to inspect whether there was any tax evasion. When they investigated the Yongyi Cigarette Factory at No. 60 Changsha Road, they discovered that the factory's accounting books showed that cigars had been sold without stamp tax affixed. They took away eight accounting books and requested the First Special District Court through the police station to issue a summons ordering the factory owner Liu Ziqing (i.e., Liu Caisheng) to appear in court for questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Junqing took his seat in the summary court to hear the case. The defendant did not appear, and lawyer Zheng Wenkai appeared in court to defend him. The police lawyer Qian Xunji [illegible character], stated that the Unified Tax Office had found tax evasion in the accounting books, totaling 443.6 yuan in cigarette price and 217.18 yuan in tax price. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 and Article 19, Section 1 of Chapter 3 of the Regulations on the Collection of Unified Tax on Cigarettes revised in 1926, a penalty of 30 times the cigarette price should be imposed. The maximum fine that can be imposed is over 12,000 yuan. A detailed list is now submitted, detailing the various taxes, for review. Ling Yin Song, representative of the Silk Tax Bureau, testified that although the factory's production books and cash flow books were consistent, there were many cigarettes on which taxes had been evaded in another book. These had now been marked in red in the accounting books. The defendant's lawyer argued that the factory was formally registered with the Ministry of Finance, and that the factory had a resident commissioner of the Special Tax Bureau, Zhu Shuqi, stationed there. All goods leaving the factory were verified and taxed by the commissioner, so there was no way to evade taxes. Or, there may have been newly arrived female apprentices whose cigarettes were of inferior quality and could not be sold. They were kept in the factory for guests or taken out by factory staff. These facts can be proven. The factory manager Liu Yinsheng is now present in court. Judge Zhang then questioned Liu briefly and ordered that the case be postponed for seven days to summon witnesses to appear in court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Telephone Lines on Roads Built Beyond the Boundaries Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>Waiting Only for the Contract to Be Signed</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of installing telephone lines on road sections built beyond the boundaries of the Shanghai concession, after repeated consultations between the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company, a full decision has been reached. The reason for the delay in signing the contract is that the internal organization of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau will undergo changes in the shortest period of time, which affects the progress of the case. As for the contract language of the case, reports have stated that it is primarily in English, but the Bureau of Public Utilities has denied this. Furthermore, regarding the problem of power supply in western Shanghai, after repeated negotiations between the Bureau of Public Utilities and the Shanghai Electric Power Company, principles have been drafted and negotiations will be conducted soon.</p>

<p>Editor: Greetings. Regarding the message of this team published in your newspaper the day before yesterday (i.e. the 13th), the section on the guidance of He Minhun's department and Yan Bowei, commander of the Sixth Route Army, in the reorganization is not consistent with the facts. After this team was advised by the Public Security Bureau to stop, it convened a meeting of all the initiators. Regarding the national salvation movement, it was decided to automatically reorganize and continue. Yan Bowei, Liu Ying, Huang Hanxiang, Chen Jianming, Yang Dianhua, Xing Zheng, etc. were invited to be the team's sponsors, but they did not guide the reorganization. This is hereby corrected. Furthermore, among the team's sponsors, there is only Liu Ying; there is no Liu Tianxiong, a counselor from the 61st Division of the 19th Route Army. Please correct this as well to show the reality. Sincerely, the Liaojihei Reyi Army Transportation Team, December 14.</p>

<h3>Discussion on the Question Raised by Mr. Li Tianfang</h3>
<p>丨See this column on December 5</p>
<p>Jiang Wenyu's Message: When this economic panic is causing all industries to wither, a monthly salary of 150 yuan can be considered not low, objectively speaking, because many people with good knowledge and qualifications may not be able to have such income. As for university students spending more than 200 yuan per semester, it seems a bit much. If it is a national university, being a bit thrifty will not cost so much. Provincial or public middle schools also do not cost 150 or 160 yuan per semester. Elementary schools do not cost more than 100 yuan. From this point of view, the tuition fees spent by your son and daughter can be reduced.</p>
<p>According to reasonable arguments, to enter university, the standard should be that only those with excellent talents who can enter good national universities. It is not right to casually enter expensive private universities. To enter middle school, the purpose should also be to prepare for higher education. If you are not preparing to enter university, you can switch to vocational schools. Even if you want to enter middle school, you should choose good ones and not enter private middle schools that are impractical and have high tuition fees. Elementary schools are very close to home, usually attended on foot, and the expenses are limited, so it does not seem to be a problem.</p>
<p>Then, calculating according to the above method, a university student spends 300 yuan per year, a middle school student spends 180 yuan per year, and two elementary school students spend 60 yuan per year, totaling 540 yuan. Saying a little more, 600 yuan is enough. Your annual income is 1,800 yuan. Subtracting 600 yuan leaves 1,200 yuan for household expenses. An ordinary life is already considered very good. From your situation, it seems that there is no major problem. The real problem is a group of people with low salaries. As your letter said: The tragedy of a certain tailor is really causing infinite emotion! I think there are several ways to solve this problem:</p>
<p>1) University education requires qualitative improvement, not quantitative increase. All children who want to enter university must be truly intelligent and excellent. The number of students admitted should not be too large. Even if they come from poor families, as long as they are truly excellent, the state should provide all tuition, board, and other expenses. Others with slightly inferior qualifications should set up more vocational schools below the secondary level. Or vocational colleges above the secondary level to meet their needs. The duration of graduation from these vocational schools can be determined according to each person's aspirations and economic situation. In the future, it is hoped that the intellectual class will change its thinking. Do not be misled by the vanity of university and send your children who are not suitable for university to university. Fortunately, in the future, universities will be able to refine themselves, with quality and quantity, naturally preventing a class of people who are good at vanity but lack real knowledge from mixing in. Besides, not entering university, having a specialty is still higher education! High school graduates can still go to pursue further studies when the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>2) If the previous item cannot be achieved for a while, it is hoped that universities will set up more free tuition slots to help a group of poor but excellent young people, which can reduce the burden on their fathers and brothers.</p>
<p>3) Vocational education must be promoted, and vocational colleges should also be established in large numbers. It is hoped that the government will take responsibility for this, and at the same time, society must do its best to advocate and promote it to promote its development. In particular, the intellectual class must determine the quality of their children before deciding on the standards for admission.</p>
<p>4) We should expand remedial education as much as possible. All out-of-school youths can go to study for free or with minimal expenses. If they are elementary school graduates and cannot afford to go to middle school, and thus go to work as apprentices in shops or factories, they can go to these remedial schools to study before 8 o'clock in the morning and after 7 o'clock in the evening. In addition to supplementing their junior high school courses and high school courses, these schools also need to teach professional knowledge and skills! It can enable them to advance step by step. After a few years, without spending any tuition money on their fathers and brothers, they can also obtain a full education from junior high school to high school, and from high school to specialized studies. We should especially support, encourage, and admire these young people who produce and study at the same time. If this kind of education can be promoted, even without many universities and university students, social undertakings can still develop, and social production can still increase. In the future, our thinking will be completely transformed. We do not need to focus on boring universities and blindly mixing university students. Pay special attention to this kind of excellent youth who are worthy of the country, worthy of society, and worthy of themselves, and do more to support and cultivate them.</p>
<p>In this way, fathers and brothers do not have to spend much money, and children can also improve. This is the best way. Therefore, we hope that society and the government will do their best to expand this kind of education and make it from a dependency to a great power under the current education system.</p>
<p>If the above four measures can be implemented, I think the problem you mentioned can probably be solved!</p>

<p>Zhang Fusheng, a resident of Wusong currently residing in a pavilion room at 17 Guangyuli, Pope Road, French Concession, is 45 years old. He was a coppersmith. During the Shanghai war this spring, his family moved to the French Concession to take refuge. His son, Haibao, is 14 years old and is his only child. He has grown up and is also learning to be a foreign coppersmith. He was resting at home due to illness. On the afternoon of the 13th, he was playing with a neighboring child in the road when a quarrel suddenly broke out. The neighboring child told his father, resulting in him being reprimanded by his father. Unexpectedly, he resented this and harbored thoughts of厌世, committing suicide by swallowing raw opium smoke on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. His father noticed and immediately sent him to Heji Hospital on Luban Road for treatment, but it was ineffective. He was transferred to Baolong Hospital, but due to the deep poisoning, the rescue was ineffective. He died at 5:20 AM yesterday. The hospital reported to the police station and transported the corpse to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Mortuary. Yesterday morning, the Second Special District Court was reported, and Prosecutor Deng was commissioned to inspect the body. He ascended to the court and, according to the testimony of the father of the deceased, Zhang Fusheng, requested to claim the body for burial. Mr. Deng instructed that after验明 that Zhang Haibao had indeed died from swallowing opium smoke poisoning, the corpse could be claimed by the father of the deceased after signing a commitment for burial.</p>
<h3>Report on Our Country's Representative Attending the Eugenics Society</h3>
<p>丨And Opening an Exhibition</p>
<p>Held in New York, Many European Participants</p>
<p>Zhao Yuanren, the supervisor of Chinese students studying in the United States at National Tsinghua University, recently submitted a report to the Ministry of Education regarding his participation in the Third International Eugenics Congress and Exhibition. The original report was quite lengthy; the following is a summary:</p>
<p>The congress was held concurrently with the Sixth International Genetics Congress at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The Genetics Congress was held from August 24th to 31st at Cornell University in Ithaca. Many European biologists participated. The Eugenics Congress opened on August 21st, and the exhibition lasted from August 22nd to September 23rd. Most of the materials were prepared by the United States. Because China was notified too late, the materials arrived in the twenties, when the exhibition was already about to close. On the first day of the congress, foreign members were invited to visit the family and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Genetics and the Eugenics Record Office, established by the Carnegie Institution of Washington on Long Island, New York. The scenery was extremely beautiful. In the morning, several laboratories were visited. The attendees were divided into four groups, each with guides, who showed and explained the research work of the researchers. They emphasized genetics, so they raised many organisms, all with very long and detailed histories of many generations. Whether it was the inheritance of good traits or diseases, they studied them all the same. Therefore, the Genetics Laboratory lived up to its name. On this day, a special olfactory experiment platform was set up outdoors. Various scented papers were placed on the platform for the guests to smell and write down their preferences and associations. In the afternoon, they returned to the Eugenics Record Office, which is a permanent institution. Most of their materials came from field workers with specialized training who investigated in various places. Most of the investigators were women. They would stay in a place, interact with the neighbors, and gradually inquire about the history of their ancestors for three generations. The format of their materials only allows researchers to consult them, and the real names of people are only recorded on the original manuscript for verification, and are never published. Therefore, those who are investigated know this method and tell the truth. The Eugenics Record Office has family trees of all kinds in the world, and they record the age, speed, and other variable factors. Because there are more than two variables, they cannot be represented by curves on a plane, so they made many quadratic three-dimensional models to represent the functional relationships of each variable. Some of them look like saddle shapes, which are purely geometric representations of functional relationships, but these saddle shapes are not related to horses at all.</p>
<p>The official opening of the congress and exhibition took place on the morning of the second day. The purpose of the congress was to improve the human race in the world. Two papers were read and discussed: one was about population control in Cuba, the second was about the Dutch method of encouraging talented people to have more children, and the third was about restricting the reproduction of those unsuitable for society. In the afternoon, the paper reading session was divided into three groups: the first group was titled "Racial Differences and the Measurement of Racial Differences, and Their Relationship to Eugenics," the second group was about papers on marriage, fertility, and reproductive capacity, and the third group's papers were all about the relationship between inferior groups in society and eugenics. In the evening, there was a formal banquet, followed by a public lecture in the hall, the main topic of which was "Production Selection and Production Restriction." On the third day, the plenary meeting began in the morning with the first article being "Eugenics and Education in Holland," and "Education in Eugenics." In between, someone talked about several aspects of guidance in eugenics, the second article was "Marriage Guidance," and the third article was "Eugenics and War in Rome." In the afternoon, the paper reading session was divided into groups. Starting from the first day, the fourth group of articles was about the physiology of reproduction and the relationship between hygiene and disease in eugenics. The fifth group was about articles on society and eugenics, and the sixth group was about articles on genetics. In the evening, the Eugenics Congress and the Genetics Congress jointly held a dinner.</p>
<p>After attending this congress, I deeply felt the fundamental importance of genetics in eugenics. The former is a basic science, and the latter is one of its applications in society. There are still some extremely important issues in the world's knowledge of genetics that are still under research. Therefore, on the one hand, we can advocate and promote the movement of eugenics based on the facts that are already known, and the exploration of genetic facts is an urgent problem. Although only an amateur from our country attended this congress, and there is only one person in the country who is specialized in eugenics, there are quite a few people in the country's academic institutions and among students abroad who are specialized in biology (including genetics). When applied to eugenics issues in the future, there can be considerable preparation. This can also be regarded as a trend on the track of Chinese education.</p>

<h3>Fourth, Outline of Implementation Methods</h3>
<p>(1) Work Requirements</p>
<p>(1) Classroom Practice: Junior high school students find mathematics the most difficult subject. Opportunities for practice and review should be provided in the classroom as much as possible, so that students' homework time can be reduced.</p>
<p>1.  Blackboard Practice: The classroom should be equipped with more blackboards. Practice problems should be assigned to students to solve on the blackboard as much as possible. This can prevent plagiarism and reduce the burden of homework for students and the difficulty for teachers in correcting a large number of practice books. Teachers can spare this time to fully guide students in self-study.</p>
<p>2.  Oral Questions: Basic concepts and rules should be questioned orally to students from time to time, and they should be asked to answer immediately. When asking questions, the question should be stated first, and then the student should be designated to answer.</p>
<p>3.  Questions: If students have any questions about the teaching materials that have been taught, they should be allowed to fully discuss them in class. When students ask questions, except for special difficulties, they should not be answered directly. The location of the difficulty should be analyzed and prompted step by step so that students can solve it themselves in order to cultivate the ability and habit of automatic research.</p>
<p>(2) Extracurricular Practice: Extracurricular practice should be done on appropriate paper or practice books, which can be determined by the teacher. When necessary, students of the same grade can be divided into groups to discuss during class time, in order to thoroughly understand, but the principle is not to violate the spirit of automatic effort.</p>
<p>(3) Examination: Students should understand the meaning and value of the examination and be happy to accept it.</p>
<p>1.  Temporary Tests: Each time should be short and the number of tests should be large.</p>
<p>2.  Paragraph Tests: Should be held at the end of each paragraph.</p>
<p>3.  Semester Tests: Should be held at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>(2) Teaching Methods</p>
<p>(1) General Remarks: 1. This subject uses a sub-discipline and parallel teaching system, which can be determined by each school. However, no matter which method is used, attention must be paid to the connection of each subject and maintain its inherent spirit. 2. Junior high school mathematics focuses on calculation. Basic concepts must be thoroughly understood. Teaching materials should not be complex or repetitive, and should emphasize understanding (such as more difficult geometric loci and the principle of solving equations in algebra) and formal training (such as difficult factor analysis methods and excessively detailed geometric reasoning). Teaching materials should be reserved for supplementary study in high school. 3. The selection of practice problems should pay attention to (A) selecting more practical problems and fewer abstract problems, (B) selecting more normal problems and fewer hypothetical difficult problems. 4. The teaching of new methods and principles should start from problem research and practical meaning, and gradually analyze and summarize. It is not appropriate to use only deductive reasoning. 5. Teaching methods should guide students to have correct thoughts and develop their analytical ability. Automaticity should be promoted at any time to eliminate the accumulated habits of reliance and hypocrisy. 6. Skills such as quick writing and neatness should be trained at any time, so that they gradually progress to proficiency and naturalness, and are close to artisticization. 7. Whenever the teaching materials have special historical interest, the teacher should mention them at any time to arouse students' interest.</p>
<p>(2) Arithmetic (1) Simple algebra should be adopted in arithmetic, such as using letters to represent numbers and recording formulas (such as interest, etc.) in order to instill algebraic concepts in advance.</p>
<p>(2) Operational skills should be proficient and agile, so attention should be paid to: (A) being familiar with approximate calculations and understanding the meaning of accuracy; (B) practicing mental arithmetic; (C) using number tables as much as possible, such as square root tables and interest tables. (3) Pay attention to application problems, such as daily calculations and statistical charts.</p>
<p>(3) Algebra: The study of equations and functions should be emphasized, and application problems should be simple and practical. Functional concepts should be taught from practical examples and linked to the variable method and ratio. 2. Algebra is closely related to arithmetic, so it should be closely linked. For example, the calculation of formulas and the algorithm of numbers are very similar, so they should be compared and linked to facilitate understanding. In addition, numerical problems should be emphasized in the calculation of function values and formula calculations.</p>
<p>(4) Geometry: 1. Geometric matters are originally intuitive teaching materials, so it is appropriate to start with experimental geometry in order to easily arouse students' interest and input clear basic concepts. When teaching experimental geometry, students should automatically draw diagrams and measure them. In solid geometry, paperboard or other models should be made by themselves. Whether it is plane or solid, all simple formulas related to measurement should be verified by experimental methods. 2. In understanding geometry, special attention should be paid to linear shapes, as they are the basis for all subsequent parts. Loci and construction problems should only be taught to a small extent. Circles and subsequent parts should only be taught selectively. More difficult theorems and loci construction problems should be discussed in high school. 3. Although geometry is the subject that emphasizes logical order the most, junior high school students often cannot feel the necessity of rigorous reasoning, so the number of axioms and assumptions should be increased. Those that are not easy to understand in the proofs of basic theorems can be temporarily regarded as assumptions without proof. The principle of incommensurability in radian, ratio theory, and area theory does not need to be raised, but should be replaced by the approximation method.</p>
<p>Numerical Trigonometry: The formal teaching of trigonometry should be moved to high school, but the application of trigonometry is very broad, and junior high school students should also know it. Therefore, it is appropriate to start with practical examples, teach the definition of trigonometric functions, and the solution of right triangles. Simple measurements can be omitted.</p>

<h3>Western Union Football Association Announces Penalties for Five Teams</h3>
<p>The Western Union Football Association announced the resolutions of the emergency meeting of the Executive Committee on Tuesday night, and the following are excerpts regarding the penalties for the teams:</p>
<p>(1) A player from the Jianan team kicked an opposing player at will in the game against Luxi on the 10th of this month. He is suspended from competition for one month from the date of the meeting.</p>
<p>(2) A player from the Shagu'er team is suspended from competition for fourteen days.</p>
<p>(3) The Zhendan team received a warning for being absent from the Group B match against Luxi at Hongkou Park on the 3rd of this month, which was considered a forfeit.</p>

<h3>Thrilling Eastern Southeast Defeats American Women</h3>
<p>Liangjiang A Beats Liangjiang B, Chongde Loses to Blue Team</p>
<h3>Western Youth Women's Basketball Tournament...Eastern Southeast and Liangjiang Remain Undefeated</h3>
<p>In the fifth game of the fourth week of the Western Youth Women's Basketball Tournament last night, the game between the Eastern Southeast and American Women was the most tense. The Eastern Southeast's situation was dangerous, but fortunately they safely passed with a score of 23 to 16, winning by seven points. Liangjiang A beat Liangjiang B, with a score of fifty to seven. Chongde suffered another defeat, losing to the Blue Team with a score of twenty to thirty-three. In the other two groups, the Green Team beat Chuji and the Red Team beat the Yellow Team.</p>
<h3>The Eastern Southeast Team's Situation Was Dangerous</h3>
<p>Although the Eastern Southeast team won last night, the situation was dangerous and worrying. The performance was not as good as in the past. The connection between the forwards was okay, but it was not appropriate to focus on scoring for themselves. The number of fouls committed by the defenders was alarming. In the first quarter, the American Women did not score until the tenth minute. However, in the second quarter, the Eastern Southeast team declined sharply and did not score a single point. When the score was 12 to 6, Wang Zhixin was called for his third encroachment foul and was sent off. When the first half ended, they were only ahead by three points, with a score of 12 to 9. In the second half, when the score was 16 to 10, Lu Xueqin was also sent off. Because the score difference was not large, the victory seemed to be in jeopardy. Fortunately, after 18 to 12, they scored two more goals and won safely with a score of 23 to 16.</p>
<p>Eastern Southeast Fouls/Score: American Women Fouls/Score: Pan Yue/Wu Feng 0 times 16, Bao Xueke/Feng 2 times 5 points, Wang Huizhen/Feng 2 times 2 points, Ensilang/Feng 2 times 0 points, Zhang Zhe/Feng 0 times 4 points, Mao Lai/Feng 1 time 11 points, Sun Xiuxiu/Feng 0 times 1 point, Ke Xiya/Wei 1 time ×, Zou Shande/Feng 1 time 0 points, 4 Lei/Wei 1 time ×, Ruizhen/Wei 0 times ×, Mike Ying/Wei 0 times ×, Wang Zhixin/Wei 3 times ×, Total 7 times 16, Lu Xue/Wei 3 times ×, Total 9 times 23. First Quarter: Eastern Southeast 12, American Women 1. Second Quarter: Eastern Southeast 0, American Women 8. Third Quarter: Eastern Southeast 4, American Women 2. Fourth Quarter: Eastern Southeast 7, American Women 5.</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Beats Their Own People</h3>
<p>Liangjiang Team A beat their own Team B. The disparity in strength was obvious, and the outcome was clear before the game. In the first half, Team A scored 26 points, while Team B only scored 6 points. In the second half, Team A scored 24 points, while Team B scored only 1 point, barely making a contribution. The final result was 50 to 7.</p>
<p>Liangjiang A Fouls/Score: Liangjiang B Fouls/Score: Chen Jucai/Feng 0 times 4 points, Luo Qiyun/Feng 1 time 2 points, Yang Sen/Feng 1 time 28, Zhu Hefeng/Feng 0 times 2 points, Pan E/Feng 0 times 14, Li Chuan'ai/Feng 0 times 2 points, Mingzhen/Feng 1 time 4 points, Xu Yunfu/Feng 0 times 1 point, Shi Ruixia/Wei 0 times ×, Huang Zhenqi/Wei 0 times ×, Chen Baixue/Wei 0 times ×, Ying Minjun/Wei 0 times ×, Huang Shuhua/Wei 1 time ×, Chen Xiuzhang/Wei 0 times ×, Total 3 times 50, Ouyang Jie/Wei 1 time ×, Total 2 times 7. First Quarter: Liangjiang A 6 points, Liangjiang B 2 points. Second Quarter: Liangjiang A 20, Liangjiang B 4 points. Third Quarter: Liangjiang A 12, Liangjiang B 0 points.

Large article shrink one eight seven five recent closing at seventeen pence one two five, forward close at seventeen pence one eight seven five. Anglo-American price, three yuan two jiao eight fen one two five. The silver dollar market is in a sluggish process. The market transactions are not comparable to last month. Yesterday's silver dollar situation: Due to the use of silver funds, the amount of funds available at the end of the year will inevitably be small, while the use of foreign funds is not as robust as the previous few days. Therefore, market transactions are not comparable to last month. As for bank collections, after a slight increase on Monday, the previous and yesterday's days were simply few and far between. The currency market situation: Jiang jiao seems to be falling again, Guang jiao is flat, and the differences are generally minor. The yuan seems to be slightly more relaxed. The interest rate is mediocre. The "foreign interest rate" was 7 qian 1 fen 3 li 3 hao 7 hu hu ban in the early market. The midday market increased by half a li, to 7 qian 1 fen 3 li 8 and 7 hu hu ban. As a result, it increased by 7 hao ban compared to the midday market the day before. However, the situation is sluggish, and it is unpredictable whether it will still be sluggish the next day. "Silver discount" The silver market is as soft as before, so the silver discount is only 1 fen, calculated as 3 fen. The prices in the morning and midday markets are the same. The markup is two to three fen. Jiang jiao slightly lower. The early market price of Jiangnan small silver dollars was 6 qian 2 fen 6 li ban, the same price in the midday market, and slightly more than half a li lower than the midday market the day before. The trading volume was 3,500 jiao in the early market and 6,000 jiao in the midday market. The early market price of Guangdong small silver dollars was 6 qian 2 fen 2 li ban, and the midday market price was 6 qian 2 fen 2 li 2 hao ban. The trading volume was 75,000 jiao in the early market and 35,000 jiao in the midday market. The exchange rate for yuan increased by 500 wen each, to 392,500 wen, with a trading volume of over 38,000 strings of wen. The receipts are sparse. "Silver funds" Yesterday, bank receipts were very sluggish. Chinese merchants received 1.6 to 1.7 million in ticket funds, foreign merchants received over 1.6 million in ticket funds, special funds were over 2 million, and various cargo, exchange tax, and miscellaneous funds received over 8.2 million. Pledge fund transactions were over 1.1 million, withdrawals from the warehouse were 700,000, and the receipts from silver houses and public houses were over 28 million. Markup funds receipts were over 4.1 million, various exchange fund receipts were over 400,000, and cash receipts were over 500,000. "Foreign funds" Exchange ticket funds made 775,000 in the early market and 515,000 in the midday market. Banknotes made 55,000 in the early market and 71,000 in the midday market. Off-site banknotes made 125,000 in the early market and 95,000 in the midday market. Check transactions made 45,000 in the early market and 40,000 in the midday market. Bank trading was 800,000 in the early market and 550,000 in the midday market. The receipts from foreign currency accounts in various banks were over 900,000. Banknotes were recalled and issued over 1.3 million. Foreign pledge fund transactions were over 500,000, with 300,000 going to the stomach. The receipts from public foreign currency houses were over 7.3 million. Foreign currency markup fund receipts were over 1.5 million. Foreign currency borrowing and lending amounted to over 1.2 million. Small foreign currency house transactions were over 500,000. Securities and bond prices generally rebounded slightly.</h3>
<p>The 20th Consolidated Salt Tax Slightly Fell. Short-term financial needs are also declining.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange had a wide variety of spot transactions, but there were still only sporadic inflows and outflows, with a total of only 18,500 yuan for the whole day. Futures were slightly more active than the previous day, with over 4.4 million in the morning session and over 4 million in the afternoon session, totaling 7.53 million yuan. The market was dominated by buying, and various prices remained quite firm, rising about one yuan more than the previous day. However, at the closing bell, large investors sold off, causing a sharp decline. Most of the important bond prices suddenly fell by more than one yuan. As a result, they generally rebounded slightly compared to the previous day, while the 20th Customs Consolidated Salt Tax both fell slightly. Short-term financial needs declined by 2 yuan and 4 jiao due to weak demand.</p>

<p>Yarn Market Afternoon Finds a Strong Upsurge</p>
<p>The Bottom is Too Dry, Reaction is Easy to Trigger</p>
<p>The yarn market was calm in the morning, but a sudden upsurge occurred in the afternoon, and the situation became very tight. This was due to the continued real demand from customers, and the market search was also strong. Most of it was still bought by Nanbu customers. Inland Sichuan also followed suit. As a result, people's hearts were excited, and scattered short positions were covered. The market rose sharply. In short, the bottom was too small, which easily led to a reaction. This is the biggest reason for the market rise.</p>
<p>Human Standard Scattered Short Covering</p>
<p>The human standard market opened in the morning. Due to the rise in gold prices, the market sentiment tightened and rose. After two or three rounds, it suddenly fell back. As a result, each month rose slightly by one, two, or three qian. The market was tighter when it opened in the afternoon. It was heard that the real demand was good. The rise in the second and third rounds became more and more intense, with each rising by one, two, three, or four qian. The total trading volume for the day was 41,200 bales. It was found that 1,450 bales of Yu Kang were sold, 1,000 bales of Heng Chang were sold, 850 bales of Da Chang were sold, 1,850 bales of Ming De were sold, 1,700 bales of Shen Chang were sold, and 1,150 bales of Chang Feng were sold. 2,050 bales of Tong He were bought, and 50 bales of Ming Hua were bought. 1,750 bales of Yi Cheng were bought, and 900 bales of Yuan Tai were bought. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Human Standard Closing, Up/Down, Inventory:</p>

<p>Total: 244,300</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales are Strong</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales are Very Active</p>
<p>Sichuan customers will increase the freight cost by 2 liang per bale of yarn from tomorrow, due to the freezing of the river and the shortage of ships.) It was found that the total amount of futures and spot yarn bought by various customers throughout the day was 3,993 bales. The market price rose by 5 qian to 1 liang. The amount of yarn bought by each customer is listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong: 865, Yunnan: 840, Jiangxi: 600, Xiamen: 10, Anqing: 25, Inland: 565, Sichuan: 550, Nanjing: 10, Ningbo: 105, Hankou: 25, Wuhu: 5, Peers: 120, Shantou: 230, Fujian: 3</p>
<p>Cotton Market Rises Even More Sharply, Gold Rush Stimulates Yarn Sales</p>
<p>General Short Positions Inevitably Panic</p>
<p>The cotton market rose more sharply. Although American cotton was flat and lackluster, the rise in gold prices discovered new highs, causing shock to people's hearts, and the market situation tightened. It was heard in the afternoon that yarn sales were strong. The cotton market benefited from this, and the rise became more intense. Short sellers appeared flustered again. However, the short position of a certain factory has not been active and re-entered. The future of the cotton market is still trending downwards, because the base goods are too thin. Most of the market psychology is that standard flowers are viewed at 3 liang outside.</p>

In the afternoon, the yarn market tended to rise, and the sentiment became sharp and favorable. The upsurge was even stronger, with each month rising by 2.3 qian.

<p>Grain and Rice Market's Downward Trend Intensifies</p>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, 40-50 ships from various customers arrived. Retail sales were sluggish due to the approaching Winter Solstice Festival. The market declined as a result. Zhen Zhen Special Bei opened at 9 yuan 7-8 jiao, but there were very few buyers. The price fell by 2 jiao. The central customs office in the same township also shrank by 2 jiao. Although the early and late customers were active, the number was not large. The situation was stable and then weak. Retail sales of foreign Du Jian were also not good. The market price was stable. (Xin Zha) Yesterday, 36-37 ships arrived. Sales on this street were in a slump. The price of the second type of Gao Ci was lower by one jiao. The downward trend of early rice was extremely strong. There were also few transactions of medium-quality goods. Although some customers took over top-quality goods, the price was only lower by 2 jiao. There were not many shipments of foreign Jian Lai, and sales were still acceptable. The price was lower by one jiao. Bian Yin Yuan was indifferent to honor or disgrace, and Ke Xian suddenly attracted the attention of speculators.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the appetite of the Ke Xian Ke customers was still huge. The shipments from Quanfu and Fuzhou continued to be sold smoothly. The arrival of goods slightly decreased, and the market situation turned firm. The foreign accounts in this street and Bengbu suddenly paid attention. Bengbu speculators bought 4,381 packages of Jiangxi Ji Wan, and local speculators bought 300 packages of Ji Wan and 200 packages of Xiang Ji Hong. There was an unexpected transaction in the market, and the market price changed dramatically, jumping up by 2 jiao. Other areas were about one jiao higher. Jiangxi Ji Wan rose from 8 yuan 2 jiao half to 8 yuan, and Hunan Ji Hong rose to 8 yuan 1 jiao. Fuzhou customers went to Wuhu Ji Yuan and 415 packages, at a price of 9 yuan to 8 yuan 6 jiao.

The market situation is expected to be good after speculators pay attention to it. According to rice merchants, there are also customers from other merchants and northern团贩 who will also make purchases because the price of rice is low.</p>
<p>Flour Market Turns Downstream Again</p>
<p>Short-term and Active, Long-term and Weak Situation Appears</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of all months uniformly declined. The price of foreign wheat fell by about 2, 4, and 5 jiao. In addition, the connection of Lianbang's business was of a relief nature, and it was expected that there would be no continued movement in the future. Moreover, Australian foreign wheat has been successively 定, and four ships were traded again in the past two days, with one ship near term at 3 liang 5 qian 6 fen, and three ships in March and April at only 3 liang 5 qian 4 fen. Therefore, the factories' unloading of the stomach was seen again, and the market uniformly fell back again. Until the opening of the market in the afternoon, the near term was still flat, and the far term was seen to decline again. Because Fuxin and Fufeng factories all saw huge amounts of deliveries from February to May. At the same time, 3,000 tons of Canadian wheat were also traded, at a price of 3 liang 6 qian 1 fen, and the market sentiment was even less stable. According to the continuous dumping of foreign wheat, the situation will again show a short-term and active, long-term and weak situation. As a result, this month fell by 5 li compared to the previous day, January fell by 1 fen 2 li half, February fell by 2 fen 2 li half, March fell by 1 fen 7 li half, April fell by 2 fen 7 li half, and May fell by 3 fen.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Flat Near Term, Down Far Term</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Continues to be Sold Short</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for wheat futures showed a flat and then declining trend. Although the price of foreign wheat fell by 2, 4, and 5 jiao in the morning, the unloading was not smooth, and the market was still able to stand firm. Until the opening of the market in the afternoon, because foreign wheat in the hands of professionals was successively sold short, the amount was quite large, and the far term was about 30 trucks. In addition, the flour market also fell, and Australian wheat was also 定 into four ships, which caused people's hearts to be very empty. The bidding price declined slightly, but the near term was relatively stable due to the arrival of goods. As a result, this month did not open, January was 2 fen better, February fell by 4 fen, March fell by 5 fen, April fell by 4 fen, and May had no comparison.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Newly Extracted Zhuang Qing Opened at Nine Liang Half, Coarse Sand White Also Improved by Five Fen, Dutch Sugar Arrived at Over 20,000 Packages</p>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram came from New York on the 13th. The sugar market's spot prices did not change, futures rose by 3 points in October, fell slightly by 2 points in January, no change in March, May, and September, and fell slightly by 1 point in July. A telegram from London on the same day stated that prices rose by 0.75 in December and May, and rose by half a penny in March. As for Javanese white sugar, yesterday's telegram still showed no changes. The local sugar market was very firm due to the reappearance of gold standard, with a high price of over 810 liang. Ersi coarse sand white Changxing Bank opened another 4-500 packages, at a price of 15 liang half, which was 1 qian higher than the opening price the day before, and 5 fen higher than the划盘. The association's afternoon划盘 called out at 15 liang 5 qian half, but the receiving accounts did not take it. The after-market also traded several hundred packages at 15 liang half. Because the prices have been rising for several days, the actual buyers did not dare to be greedy and make further purchases. The price of 20号 medium sand white was 14 liang 8 qian, and the price of 18号 was 14 liang 4 qian half. The price of Dutch red sugar at 8, 9, and 10号 remained unchanged.

<p>Metals British Tinplate Overseas Prices Rise Huisi Steel Newly Contracted in Large Quantities, White Lead Skin Soars by Four Liang Half</p>
<p>Tinplate It is reported that besides the 40,000+ boxes of British tinplate which were returned from the Boxer Indemnity, and sold off gradually, there are still 11,000 boxes in stock. These goods are being stored by Taihe, Tianxiang, Maolong, and other foreign firms. Due to the soaring price of tinplate on the overseas market, local trading firms are competing to buy them. The selling price is actually lower than it was before, now down from 11 liang, 1 qian, to 10 liang, 9 qian, (the market price is 11 liang, 3-4 qian.) We've heard that metalwork shops along North Suzhou Road are trying to acquire these.</p>
<p>Huisi Steel The Reuters quotation yesterday was 14 pounds, 5 shillings, which is 10 shillings more than it was before. There are 75 tons in stock. We have heard that a certain metalwork shop on North Suzhou Road has placed an order. It turns out that these goods are handled by the Chinese firm Hezhong Company.</p>
<p>White Lead Skin The city is experiencing a strange shortage of #2 white lead skin, and tea companies have been making purchases. Thus, trading firms are rushing to explore the market abroad, and price reports should be coming in the day after tomorrow. The current market price in Shanghai has soared from 20 liang to 24 liang, 5 qian, (A).</p>
<p>Silk and Tea Silk Market The Worst is Over</p>
<p>The foreign firm silk market yesterday grew gradually better. American firms were slightly settled, and French firms kept pace. The goods for American firms must indicate evenness at the time of contract, and insistence on selling at evenness on the top side is not happening. Evenness on the medium side also depends on good prices to sell, so sales for American firms are trending towards stagnancy. All sub-par silks for American firms must be sold to French firms, and there is a market for French firms, so they are also able to offer good prices, about 40-50 liang, Chinese firms are also willing to sell, as they take the easier procedures. Shanghai ground merchants, because the sales for American are smooth, fear it will be difficult to move goods, and they are also offering prices to collect, the B-grade goods moved last week for 510 liang are now being sold for 580 liang.</p>

<h3>Chongde Team Suffers Another Crushing Defeat</h3>
<p>Although the Chongde team's ball skills are not bad, it is a pity that their players are small, leading to repeated failures, which is truly regrettable. Last night, they took an early lead of 4-0, but were gradually overtaken by the Jian Dui team. However, they still won the first quarter by one point, with a score of 6-5. From then on, they couldn't manage to score much. Fortunately, they fought hard in the second half and regained some points, but ultimately lost to the Blue Team with a score of 33-20.</p>

<h3>Strong Fluctuations in Finance and Gold Markets</h3>
<p>(Hedging Turns Out to Break Even) The market changed very quickly yesterday, with rising prices in the morning and at noon. There were many twists and turns in between. There was a total difference of ten taels between the morning and noon prices, and the overall price was 500 cash lower than the previous day, which was disappointing. The trend of falling prices in the afternoon market did not stop, and the exchange rate continued to rise. However, forward silver prices have been falling for many days. Therefore, the gold price should have opened high. However, the foreign exchange rate increased by another one and a half levels, and then a new high price of 818 taels and 800 cash appeared. Afterwards, news suddenly came from overseas that the French public unanimously opposed repaying the US debt, and said they would absolutely not pay it. When the market received this news, people's emotions were agitated and selling pressure was immense, and the price fell sharply by more than ten taels. The noon closing price was flat. The post-market was closed because it was Wednesday. Hengxing, a short seller, made a swap of more than 200 contracts from December to January with Yingfeng Heng, and it had already been squared. This was because spot goods were continuously being shipped to Shanghai, so Minfeng had sufficient reserves. Tomorrow (the 16th), the price for swapping January to February is likely to be raised, but it will only be a matter of the buy side edging up one or two taels.</p>
<p>(Slightly Decreased by Five Cash After Several Ups and Downs) Since the opening price for January was a gain of four taels and eight hundred cash, at 814 taels and eight hundred cash, the silver price private telegraph also decreased by 5/16ths. Fuyu, Tianfeng, Yong, etc. bought in, and then added two taels, for a total of seventeen taels. The price was lowered by two taels, to fifteen taels, because Huabi released January US dollars at 75, and March at 28 yuan. In addition, Hengyu, Dadecheng, goods, etc. sold. The price was then raised by three or four taels to 18 taels and 800 cash, a little after 9:20, because the US dollars were being traded at 875 in February, and Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongda, Xingyongheng, Yuan, etc. were very interested in buying. US dollars were being traded at 9375 in March, so the price was raised again. Around 9:30, when the exchange rate quoted by HSBC was announced, the British gold decreased by 375, and the US dollar decreased by only 25 after being factored into the exchange rate. Around 9:30 the price was at eighteen taels. Afterwards, Zhaofeng, Changyuanmao, Yongyongfeng, Yuantai, etc. unloaded. Huabi and HSBC, etc. sold April US dollars at 28 yuan and 625 cash, and February was settling at 875, and at nearly 10:00 the price was at fifteen taels and six hundred cash. Bingxing, etc. bought more than 200 contracts. Huabi bought March at 28 yuan, and the price went back up by two taels. At 10:10 the price was at seventeen and a half taels. Later, it seemed to soften, because it was heard that there were more spot goods every day, and the swap rate for last month was breaking even. Moreover, short positions were active, and arbitrageurs were drawing remittances and issuing orders. Fuxing, Yongfuchang, Zhifengyong, Yuanyuanmao, Hengyu, Hengxingyuan, etc. were all issuing orders. The price was around sixteen taels before 11:00. Afterwards, unfavorable news for the bulls was heard, saying that France had decided not to repay the US debt, causing great panic, and Fuyu, Qianchangxiang, Hongxing, Fengyong, Richangyuan, Xingyong and Shunli, Wanxing, etc. all sold off. HSBC issued March British gold at 4375, and Shanghai issued US dollars at 625, causing the market price to plummet, until 11:45 the price was 8 taels and 800 cash. During that time, the market spread was only a few hundred cash. Afterwards, Yifengyong, Hengxingyuan, Fuyu and zero-lot investors came in, pulling up one and a half taels, to ten taels and three hundred cash, and then fell back to nine taels and two hundred cash. The noon closing price was nine taels and five hundred cash, which was slightly less than the previous day by five hundred cash. After the close, it was suppressed to around seven taels, because Hengyu and Fuyu continued to sell off. However, the Guangdong guild Yifeng took advantage of the fall to buy in, and then raised the price to above nine taels again. According to the market, the maximum was 18 taels and 800 cash, and the minimum was 8 taels and 800 cash, a difference of ten taels. The red tape added only nine and a half taels, which was the effect of there being more spot goods every day.</p>
<p>(Suppressed by Eight Taels) The opening price was based on the US dollar hanging at 25 cash, so it was changed to 873 taels. It was calculated to be 55 and 60 taels. Afterwards it was 64 taels, and the noon closing price was 63 taels, which was more than the previous day by eight taels. The logging account was eleven taels for December, ten taels for January, and a make-up water payment of nine taels.</p>
<p>(Very Few Large Bills Traded) In face-to-face transactions, demand was unremitting in the morning, but then selling exceeded buying. According to statistics, Yuanmao Yong, Daxing Yong, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Hengchangyong, Bingxing, etc. all bought, while Hengyu, Wanxing, Yuanchun, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Hong, Yong, etc. had complex ups and downs. Yifengyong, Shunli, Zhifengyong, Hengxingyuan, Fuxingyong, Zhaofengchang, Yuanmao, etc. all sold. The Dalian guild issued a total of more than 600 contracts and bought more than 400 contracts. The Guangdong guild, such as Hengxing, bought fewer, while Yifeng bought about 200 contracts. However, due to large customers being on the swap side, there were no large bill transactions. The contract amount for each firm was approximately 19,500 to 19,600 contracts.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Repeatedly Increase</h3>
<p>Domestic Market Also Exceptionally Tight, Gold Businesses Rush to Close Positions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market repeatedly saw declines, while the exchange rate rose again by 1.5 to 1.75 cents. As for the local exchange market, British gold and US dollars were tight. The HSBC exchange rate was reduced one and a half notches after two previous reductions compared to the day before, for a total reduction of 375 for British gold and 25 for US dollars. Hong Kong also rose by 25, while the rest remained the same. The domestic British gold market initially showed strength, then stabilized, rising by another 1875 compared to the night before. The US dollar early market was also slightly better, then became tighter, and then reversed and loosened, resulting in the same result as the previous day. This was indeed due to the influence of the rising exchange rate. Transactions in the Chinese gold industry were not bad. Closing positions for British gold were only several tens of thousands of pounds, while US dollars were approximately 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Because the contract gold price was high, hedging was still profitable, so many rushed to close positions. However, around noon, the gold market turned downward due to news of the war debt not being repaid, so there were not many who closed positions. On the banking side, Chinese banks sold gold, while Huabi bought it. In addition, interbank transactions were also not uncommon. In the afternoon market, the (British exchange rate) domestic market was only up and down by 625 cash. The opening price was selling at 1 shilling, 8 pence, 1375, and a half penny for the forward price. The buying price was 4375 to 5625. Huabi issued March at 4375, and then bought January at 375. HSBC issued March at 4375. The noon closing price was the same as the early market.</p>
<p>(US Exchange Rate) The domestic market had a 25 point difference. The early market buying price for this month was 27.75 yuan, 8125 for January, 9375 for February, and 28 yuan for March. The buying price was 27.875 to 28.125 yuan, and the difference between this month and March in swaps was 25. Zhongfu issued March at 28 yuan, and Zhejiang Huabi traded February at 9375. An, Huabi traded January the same. Zhongfu HSBC issued April at 28.0625 yuan. Dazhou issued February at 875. Yuntong traded January at 8125. Shanghai issued February at 875. Huabi absorbed March at 28 yuan. Pan Gen issued Huabi to buy March at the same price. Huabi bought February at 9375. Shanghai issued March at 28 to 0625 yuan. Zhongfu and Zhejiang traded March at 28 yuan. The noon closing selling price was 27.875 yuan for this month, 9375 for January, 28.0625 yuan for February, and 125 for March. The buying price was 28 yuan to 28.375 yuan. The quoted price was one yuan equal to 3 taels, 6 qian, 3 fen, 636 liang of silver.</p>
