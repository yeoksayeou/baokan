<p>時評</p>
<h3>評日本言論界之遠東和平觀明</h3>
<p>據電訊。最近日本朝日日日等十三新聞社。以日本言論界之名義。發表宣言。宣布反對五國會議之决議草案。并謂欲期遠東時局安定。須先期滿洲政治之安定。滿洲政治之安定。首在承認所謂滿洲國。承認滿洲國爲遠東和平之根本。凡反對滿洲僞國獨立之决議案。日本斷不能同意。此種極其强横無理之言論。竟能以日本整個言論界之名義發出。吾人誠深爲日本言論界惜。吾人固明知此種［所謂輿論。］不過徒爲其軍閥之傳聲機。軍閥之傳聲機軍國主義御用之工具。然而詖言惑世。吾人亦不能不予以嚴正之批駁</p>
<p>在日本所謂言論界之宣言中。一則曰［和平］再則曰［和平］所謂［和平］者。果世界之和平耶。抑爲日本一國之和平耶如曰爲世界和平則吾人敢問日本言論界。今日遠東時局之不安。究由何因而起乎。在九一八禍變之前。遠東時局有如今日之紛擾乎。有如今日之使世界各國爲之談虎色變乎。夫惟日本一手造成九一八之禍變。一年以來。對我侵略。更變本加厲而遠東時局。乃頓陷入極度不安之悲局。世界和平與正義。都遭受嚴重之威脅。此種事實。至爲顯明。全世界公正之人士。類皆能灼見。故今日而欲使遠東時局。歸於安定。惟有取消滿洲僞國。撤退日軍回復去年九一八以前之狀態。庶能掃除一切糾紛。并使世界和平之基礎。益臻鞏固。而今日日本之所謂言論界。竟一手抹煞往日之事實。倒因爲果。指承認所謂滿洲僞國之獨立。爲遠東和平之基礎。此種邏輯。誠不知其何所依據。而其牽强附會。甘爲日本軍閥之喉舌。吾人更不知其究將置言論界之尊嚴於何地。</p>
<p>循日本所謂言論界之意。則其所謂［和平。］特日本一國之和平耳換言。</p>
<p>之。即世界各國都應仰承日人之意志。而任其爲所欲爲耳。樹立滿洲僞國爲和平否認滿洲僞國即爲非和平。依此種主張而演繹之。則日本若於包辦滿洲僞國之後。更就西伯利亞再創立一僞國。不將使遠東時局。益爲安定乎。或更由海洋南進。在菲列濱羣島或新加坡建立一僞國。則世界和平。將不更永永安定如磐石乎。和平之解釋固如是乎日言論界如一沉思反省又寗能不唖然失笑。</p>
<p>夫所謂滿洲國之樹立。乃爲日人以暴力從中國領土割裂一角。一手包辦而成即李頓報告書中。亦已明白認定。日本爲包辦僞國。竟不惜傾其國力。派遣大軍。耗無數之生命。是果眞爲基於公正之立塲。扶植［滿洲國］之獨立耶。脱眞然者。則日本鐵蹄之下。固有朝鮮台灣兩民族。正力謀獨立而不可得。日本固何必捨近面救諸遠乎。在日人卵翼扶植下之朝鮮台灣兩民族。今已永淪於國亡家破之慘墳。今日人復重演其舊劇於我東北。而又曰是爲和平也。是爲扶植近鄰也嗚。呼全。世界公正人士之耳目。果可以一手掩盡耶。日言論界即欲爲日本軍國主義之野心與暴行。加以掩飾。益適足爲全世界公正人士所共同側目耳。</p>
<p>雖然。吾人固深知今日之事。不徒在於空口之辯論也。暴力刦持之下。言又奚益。而且在禍變爆發之初。吾人即早已决定。必恢復我東北之正常狀態。而後東北問題乃有解决之可能。直至今日。吾人仍認定必日本放棄其包辦下之所謂滿洲國。而後中日間一切糾紛。乃有解决之望。世界和平。乃可實現。此種事實。自非空口之辯論所能致之吾人要當竭盡我全力以求之耳</p>

<h3>國聨工程專家導淮工程計劃意見書</h3>
<p>導淮爲改善中國經濟之首要問題全部工程舉辦後可免除水旱之患</p>
<p>導淮工程、於國計民生、關係甚鉅、導淮委員會前經擬定江海分疏計劃呈奉國府核准備案、全國經濟委員會對於導淮工程、亦認爲改善中國經濟之首要問題、曾於去年冬季邀請國聨工程專家四人、以國聨水利交通股長哈斯氏爲之長、由導淮會副總工程師須愷、陪同前往淮域各河流視察一週、並對於導淮委員會所定計劃、加以意見、作爲報告、茲節譯國聨工程專家函陳經濟委員會關於導淮工程計劃之報告於、以爲關心導淮問題者之參考、</p>
<p>淮河流域位於北界黄河南界揚子江之間、面積約二七○、○○○平方公里、淮河本有自入海尾閭、至十三四世紀間、黄河在開封附近决口纂奪淮河洩水之道淮水遂不得不别尋去路、一八五二年（卽清咸豐五年）黄河雖復由開封北徙、但因泥沙沉積河床高仰淮河下游不能復其故道、是以數百年來淮河因無寬暢槽身以排洩洪水遂致災害頻生、</p>
<p>欲防此災歷來所擬導淮計劃甚多但其中頗有可以屏置勿論、以其所根據之資料不足、况淮河旱年流　與非常洪水情形之懸差限量、近年已得愈確當之决定、并深知導淮目的、不儘乎防洪、又在乎灌漑、與航運等、深覺櫃鈕所在、厥惟盡量利用洪澤湖蓄水、庶可得一切實利、此外無其他方法能如是完善與有效、以减免洪澤湖下游之最大洩量及從來所受之水災情形、又同時用此方法、當夏季雨量異常减少之年蓄水濟灌漑航運之需、故昔時所擬計劃、其有不知利用此天然蓄水庫以得是　極重大利益者、亦可置之矣在第一期内主要問題、爲淮河逾量洪水由洪澤湖洩出者將㈠經由三河及高寳諸湖出三江營、以人揚子江乎、抑㈡經由某河檀、大致向東逕卽引以人海乎、然予以適宜之經濟狀况、在以後期内兼用兩法、其情形仍可理加改良與增進安全也、</p>
<p>委員等曾研究導淮委員會之工程計劃及其編制拽集之多卷文件與資料、目承全國經濟委員會之招待、待以自懷遠以上淮河某處下迄洪澤湖、實地親察查勘蔣壩洪澤　上及淮陰附近擬築閘壩之地址視察監河與廢　河槽多處、並由淮陰從運河南下經高　湖至邵伯以迄揚子江、同人　未獲與導淮委員會總工程　李　　會　、不無遺憾、但　同人等駐事時、李氏正在他處辦理重要工程、然得該會代理總工程輝須愷共同討論、并爲必要之解　、又承其陪同實地　察、自蚌埠以迄揚予江、</p>
<p>導淮委員會工務處、經詳細研究流域形勢、及迄有一九一六年（民國五年）與一九二一年（民國十年）非常大水之長時期水位兩量與被淹　積等記載、後於一九三○年（長國十九年）决定淮河注入洪澤湖之最大洪水量、爲每秒一五○○○立方公尺、可以全採用爲設計防洪工程之　　、並考慮一九三一年（民國二十年）大水記載之結果、同人等推測該項决定數無修改之必要、茲應説明者、非常大水之年、包括一九三一年在内、洪澤湖以上淮隄發生潰决、胡上述最大洪水量、非憑直接測騐、乃　各種計算法得之也、已從事充分考量而算得淮河上游隄及　直工程實施後所能發生之最大洪水量、同人等雖未盡恢意、但於他方面觀之、計算方法、尙稱　當而每秒一五○○○立方公尺之數、事實上實爲合理充足也、又司言者、如最大洪水是達每秒一五○○○立方公尺時、按一九二一年（民國十年）記載所示、僅約三十日之時期、其流量可超遇每秒一○○○○立方公尺云、</p>
<p>據此假定、則湖以上所需防洪工程應按最大洪水量每秒一五○○○而設計、漸向上游、則爲相當之遞减、然在湖水出口處操縱洩水之閘壩、應全憑　及下游排洪道門能容受之最大水量而計劃之也、</p>
<p>首就洪澤湖上游之淮河一部份言之、導淮委員會擬定沿淮河本幹應築隄防、兩隄相距約三公里至四公里改直支流數首、并酌量併合密近之支流、而後入淮應築之淮隄、並延展至支流之上、外此當有其他附屬工程、係改進航運與灌漑者原擬　後興辦、故無須於本報告論及（未完</p>

<h3>何炳賢談中俄貿易情形</h3>
<p>復交後兩國商業當有進步俄貨價廉於我國不無裨益國人當以提倡國貨爲政策</p>
<p>中蘇宣告復交後、兩國人民、同聲慶賀、此事不僅敦睦兩國邦交、即兩國間經濟、亦將因此大爲增進、實業部國際貿易局局長何炳賢氏、昨發表中蘇貿易情形甚詳、茲爲錄誌如下、</p>
<p>蘇俄國外貿易制度</p>
<p>蘇俄國外貿易完全爲政府之獨占權、亦即蘇俄新經濟制度、整個系統中之一部份、於一九一八年四月二十二日、即以法律規定之、此項特權之主管機關、爲國外貿易人民委員會、實際經營者、爲政府特設之全國進出口貿易公司及國營實業機關附設之貿易公司、其他特許之貿易公司等、人民機關、非經特許、不得經營國外貿易、其國營之主要目標、一爲蘇俄機製工業之落後、不得不以國營方法、吸收重要工業建設之必需品、一爲蘇俄國民經濟受重大之錯亂分配、不得不重分配國民之得得、故其出入口、均爲有計劃的限制、有系統　規劃、一方面以各種的工業所需原料機械、以及器具之需要爲轉移一方面又以剩餘貨物信用、以及各種無形收入之可能償付必需輸入品差額者爲標準、換言之、即國家根據旣定之計劃、需要之程度、商品生産之剩餘、以求國外貿易之合理化、</p>
<p>蘇俄國外貿易現狀</p>
<p>蘇俄在一九三年時、尙在帝俄時代、其每年之生産額、値二○、○四○億虜布、革命以係、逐年增進、一九三○年度、已爲二九·一○○億盧布、（按戰前率計算）指敎應爲一四五·二、即增加百分之四十五、但其出口、則較一九一三年時、下减甚多、出口與生産額之经率、一九一三年爲百分之七·六、現時不過百分之二·九、可知生産之增加、及出，口方面之限制、而在出口商品内、又幾全限於木材·煤油·皮貨·亞麻·苧蔴·五榖·等類、合全出口五分之三、其主因即爲蘇俄在革命後之大基本、改變出口、并非以國内之剩餘出産品、往國外求營利之市塲、而純粹爲償付必需入口商品差額之用、故出品之數量、旣以必需入口商品爲轉移、戰前帝俄、素爲世界農産品之重要國家、（戰前農産品出品占百分之七十）現時已趨向於工業之出口、占百分之六十矣、</p>
<p>中蘇間之貿易情形</p>
<p>中蘇間貿易革命前後、有顯著之變遷、此即應注意我國對蘇貿易爲被動的、蘇俄對我貿易、則爲自動的、全受蘇俄國營政策之控制、歐戰前對俄輸出、約値四千八百萬關兩左右、近來有增至八九萬者、（十九二八）一九三零年約五千餘萬、但商品種類、則有變遷、自俄輸入、　前約値二千餘萬關兩、近年亦不過此數、復交以後、雙方貿易、自當有顯著之進步、同時國人又正在訂購俄貨、以補國貨之缺乏、交通雖以東北叛逆關係、不無影響、然新疆豪古及西北方面交通、亦稱便利貿易之發展、自可預期唯蘇俄對外貿易已有原定政策輸入當絕對以必需品爲限、即輸出亦以不妨碍本國國民經濟者爲標準、非其他自由經營商業之國家可比、故復交以後、兩國間貿易發展或趨重於輸入一點、如煤油·木材·以及其他蘇俄能運銷國外之商口·當有大宗輸入、以價廉關係、於我國不無裨益、而出口往俄者、則未見能有特殊顯著之成績、大宗輸俄品、原爲豆　及茶、而豆類本年以叛逆關係前途未可知其他則多非俄國所必需、此就歷年來統計消長上可以推测、在此種時間、國人苟不切實注意於對商品之推銷、則結果或將改變歷年來之出超而爲對俄入超、貿易發展亦難如國人現在熱烈期望之甚總之、國人當以提倡國貨貨展實業爲永久之基本政策自謀國外新市場之出路、則庶幾矣</p>
<h3>俄商務代表開始活動</h3>
<p>與我商界接洽推銷事宜</p>
<p>南京電云、商界息、中俄復交之後、俄之駐京平津滬漢之商務代表、將公開活動、與我商界接洽推銷事宜、預料兩國大使派定後、俄方先復海參　上海間之航綫、專輸貨物、并將在津滬兩處組織大貨站及大貿易商行、俄在華銷售之貨、以毛織品·煤油·五金材料·呢絨布匹·紙張及其他一切雜貨爲大宗、</p>

<h3>讀者顧問</h3>
<p>㈠關於包志正君所提問題之討論</p>
<p>丨丨原函見本月十七日本欄</p>
<p>徐梗生君訊··讀竟來函，吾人但覺有無窮憤慨，蕴集心頭，直欲破腔而出丨取締卜筮星相巫覡堪輿，誰謂不當？而乃徒有取締之文，取締之後，使其從事何種［正當職業］？投入何處［地方設立之工廠］？如何［令其負擔相當工作］，都茲事體大，非從根本入手不爲功；然則根本之之，地又究在何時，乃得實現乎？此其一也。其次，卜筮星相者流，旣已覺悟，［有心改業］，而［公安局］［反勒令照常營業，］寜非［天下奇談］？原來此輩［長官］之［太太少爺，設有疾病，］須［替他祈禱］；故江蘇省政府雖有［取締辦法七項］，而［公安局］仍［勒令照常營業］。［勒令］之不足，更須［義務］，［義務］之不足，再加［百般苛索］，［攫取］［黑費］，凡此種種，幾使吾人不能明瞭，今日是何世界？雖然，此皆題外之文，以鄙人之見，足下旣不甘受此［黑暗］之［威迫］，唯一［新的出路］，祗有毫不猶豫的加以［反抗］。可聨合貴同業［九十餘家］，共同上呈江蘇省政府與監察院，請即澈查　辦。想［當局］猶望政治有澄清之日，對於此等［黑］的［公安局］，必能予以相當懲戒。其次爲今後職業問題。貴地旣無工廠，此層確極爲難，但取締辦法中，旣明定期限，在所定期限内，似儘可陸續分别改業，不至感忽促不及。如因公安局之［勒令］，已經遲誤不少時間，則亦可釋明理由，呈請主管官署展期。至所改之業，亦無一定，體健者可以務農，文理較好者，可充書記錄事，餘者都可爲商，惟盲者頗有問題耳。總之，驟時之改革，必有相當困難，稍待若干時日，即一切不成問題，幸足下及貴同業中人，勿以改業困難，惴惴爲慮，一時之痛苦，即可換得前途無窮之希望也。</p>
<p>㈡顧潤生君訊；我是一個十八歲的青年，本年署假在初中畢業了。我的本意是繼續求學的，但是我的祖父不答應。因爲他在日城開着一爿店，生意還不錯。可是我父親總不管事，終日　家裏抽大烟。祖父的意思，要我到他店裏去相帮。他説，上學不過是那麽一回事，現在趁早練練，將來便是接手的人了。我却以爲現在祖父還勞碌得來（他現在六十多歲），經濟也還算寛裕，正可趁此機會議我升學，再説我現在年齡很輕，對於世故人情，商情賬目，都是茫無頭緖，就是終天坐在店裏，也不能帮他的忙，實在大家没有好處。因此和老人家説了幾次。他起先　是不答應，後來説急了，反説我年輕不懂事，不愛上進，先生，你説這不寃死人嗎？············</p>
<p>現在没有别的話，我雖然被老人家囚在店　，但是我的升學的念頭還没打消，先生，請你敎給我一個辦法！</p>
<p>［答］足下鋭意求進，本刋深表同情。令祖的意見，在青年看來，不免［背時］，但也有他的道理。想來，令祖現有的事業是他一生勞碌的收穫，他對於書本的知識，當然無深切信仰，再加現在許多學校畢業生，每每使老輩失望；他當然和足下的意見不同了。本來，書本的知識和實地的經騐，是互濟的。。單有知識而無經騐，這種知識是飄浮的；單有經騐而無知識，這種經騐是狹隘的，現在的學校敎育大都少注重實踐而多注重理論，這便是只知求知識而忽略了經騐；所以上學並不一定獲得理想的結果；無怪要使人懷疑了。譬如，足下以爲現在［對於世故人情，商情賬目，都是茫無頭緖］，所以要升學，但即使大學畢業以後，［對於世故人情］，恐怕依然［茫無頭緖］，便是［商情賬目］雖是見在書本，可是書本所載只是要理，商塲中的實在情形，仍是千變萬化，使人［茫無頭緖］。况且令祖現在本不要足下獨當一面，只是［練練］而已。這正是個絕好機會。足下旣有心上進，不妨在暇時自修，這樣，將所得經騐和書本上的知識聨繫起來，足下半年中所獲得必抵到學校中一年的成績，或更切於實用。千萬别過信學校敎育而坐失良機也。</p>

<h3>晚收跌四兩半</h3>
<p>下午繼午收之餘風、三兩八錢開盤、散戶仍進、好起四五錢、然義豐永再來賢出、降至二兩四錢、兆豐昌·大德成則進、復穿出四兩、人後三月美金一二五銀行想要、場内福餘·乾昌祥先後買進、遂漲至六兩五錢、此後匯巿恍惚安達出美金二十八元、正月人心轉疲、萬興·義豐永·大德成·乘機售出、跌小三兩餘、降爲三兩、恒興仍進、價遂退至二兩、益豐·元亨拖進、又至四兩、無如人心已疲、三月美金做一八七五、乃收低盤、爲二兩六錢、較前日續跌四兩五錢、查連日現貨續小、洵以北方源源而來於是金價陡陷疲頺之境、又金巿最高價八百十兩、最低價八百零二兩、有八兩盤旋</p>
<h3>揭價多四兩</h3>
<p>揭價以美滙未動、仍爲八百七十二兩七錢三分、照收巿而言約　七十兩較前日多　四兩、十二月份登賬爲八百零四兩、正月份及二月份同爲八百零三兩、　水八百零一兩、</p>

<h3>匯巿明暗俱鬆</h3>
<p>華商金號出納互異銀行對做亦屬不少</p>
<p>昨銀巿無電、本埠匯豐掛牌僅法德和等略爲放長、餘如英美印坡均無升降、香港忽已加二五、爲七十七兩半、殆内盤自晨尙平、旋後見鬆、午後由穏而鬆、結果比較上週六計英金長○六二五美金長一二五、乃金價已跌三天矣、昨降在四兩以上而各銀行交易雖無鉅量、然猶亦不寂、計英金十餘萬鎊、華商金號出納互異又銀行對做者亦屬不少又美金約六七十萬元、各號扒塞不一、銀行如花旗有所吸收、又上海至下午做進三月滙兑、計美金二十八元一八七五、英金一八·三一二五、合美金三元三角三分、今將或交價錄后、</p>

<h3>厘拆在靜止中</h3>
<p>歲闌伊週、商業舊例、對於全年收解存放帳略、大部份從事歸東、昨又值週初、形勢格外浩繁、逆科往後將尤甚焉、至於洋欵用途、以商事收束、勢必清閑、故銀洋進出日來恒有互殊之事實、來源旣少、夫胃亦不如從前之多矣</p>
<h3>厘拆同價微有軒輊</h3>
<p>［洋厘］早午巿以無人競爭、兩巿同價、爲七錢一分三厘八毫七忽半、較前日午巿微小一毫二叙半、［銀拆］早午兩巿同爲二分、劃頭加水始終無巿、可見銀根之鬆濫、</p>

<h3>上週孟買存銀略减</h3>
<p>十七日孟買電、茂溫奇公司銀巿報告上週銀巿、因國外消息平靜而無變化、存銀力見减少、一方由於内地到貨鬆弛、一方因用路略增之故、上週收巿比較堅穏但巿面亦不甚活動、現在預計十二月十九日後將增存銀一萬一千五百條上週内地用銀每日平均五十五條、較前週每日又增十條上週倫敦運來銀什四萬鎊與前週同、在途郵船、無銀儎來、</p>

<h3>紐約股巿參差</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、上週六（十七日）紐約股巿、各股初開時尙堅、旋因啤酒案光景良好、可口可樂致受打擊、巿况又傷疲軟、鐵路貨車數共五二一、二一六輛、較前週减二六、二四五輛、半日成交數共四十一萬四千股、綜觀目前股巿、形勢暫時或將無重大變化、蓋政治與商業種種問題之利害關係、尙難估計、一方面投資者不致輕易售出、一方面因政局不定、工商無顯著進步、亦不願大量收進、故預料目前股巿將無大變化也、茲將十七日蚝巿列左、</p>

<h3>紗花現紗消費驟清</h3>

<p>紗巿驟落、形勢轉趨軟化、實需益覺停滯、廣東雲南兩帮來電有止裝説、而報載熱河日軍砲轟劇、烈致人心不振、但一般散戶做多心思尙熱烈云、</p>
<h3>人標跌一兩五六錢</h3>
<p>人標前巿開盤、隨外棉而堅、詎料二三盤突跌、巿氣恐慌、以現紗生意清淡不振之故、各月跌一兩至一兩一·二·三·四錢、午後巿勢仍弱、各月跌·二·三·四·五錢、全日成交統計五萬一千三百包、查賚出梅記一千七百包、恊生一千一百包、振大九百包、森康八百包、同孚一千零五十包買進吉豐一千一百包、賡豐一千五百五十包、長餘一千三百包、益昶一千零五十包、立昶九百包、茲將收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>本月棉降六錢半</h3>
<p>棉巿暴落、但巿氣尙堅、以一般棉商傾向買進、㈠以國内生産不豐、㈡各路來源凋疲、存底太枯、㈢近來美棉形勢平穏、㈣本月份某廠商抛出之額太巨、每月交貨品殊感缺乏、有此數因、投機者羣爭購進、做多心氣頗濃、因之巿面較紗巿爲昂、據云某廠商在天津山東搜辦大量棉花裝載來滬矣、</p>
<h3>鄭標散多了結</h3>
<p>鄭標前巿開盤、本月份軋空、形勢仍緊、散戶抵補不動、拍至遠月稍跌、二盤本月份大跌、商塲上多説某廠商在天津山東等處收買粗絨棉有四千件來滬之説、故散多了結、巿盤猶如青天霹靂、突跌五錢半、破進三兩關口、但遠月買方仍拉緊不放、（尙有一説有數家經紀商代某外商購進七萬担之巨）所以多頭方面態度愈挺、近跌四錢半至六錢、遠跌一錢半至二錢、午後本月跌五分、中月漲五分遠平、全日成交統計十七萬三千三百担、查賚出源興昌一萬四千六百担、同和二千八百担、愼昌四千二百担、榮興二千三百担、大豐三千三百担、賡豐三千二百担買進申新椿七千二百担、賡豐一萬三千五百担、瑞大四千一百担、源大七千二百担、畏和四千七百担、長豐三千七百担、吉豐三千四百担、茲將盤價列下、</p>

<h3>印英棉業週訉</h3>
<p>（孟買）上週巿况因空戶抵補、依然緊穏、日商改進白羅溪花以代奥姆辣、　東靜寂、直至近今、某著名日商突然活動、到貨遜延、抛額缺乏、兼之上印度售金所得之鎭、可使棉農不致急於售棉、故巿况仍可繼續堅昂、現需略有進步、本地廠家　購急用、附錄上週統計如下、（戰位千包）</p>

<h3>蓮花落（一）</h3>
<p>— 穆時英</p>
<p>飄泊着，秋天的黄葉子似地，一重山又一重山，一道水又一道水丨我們是兩個人。</p>
<p>和一副檀板，一把胡琴，一同地，從這座城到那座城，在草屋子的柴門前，在　在宫墻中間的黑漆大門前，在街上，在考塲裏，我們唱着蓮花落，向人家化一個銅子，化一杯羹，化一碗冷飯丨我們是兩個人。</p>
<p>是的，我們是兩個人，可是她在昨天死了。</p>
<p>是二十年前，那時我的頭髮還和我的眼珠子那麽黑，大兵把我的家轟了。一家人死的死了，跑的跑了，全不知那去啦。我獨自個兒往南跑，跑到傍晚時眞跑累了，就跑到前面那隻凉亭那兒去。就在那兒我碰到了她。她在裏邊，坐在地上哭，哭得抽抽咽咽的。我那時候兒還怕羞，離遠些坐了下來。她偷偷兒的瞧了瞧我，哭聲低了些。我心廟想。。勸勸她吧丨這姑娘怎麽一個人在這兒哭。</p>
<p>［别哭了，姑娘丨哭什麽呢］丨我坐在老遠的跟她説。</p>
<p>她不作聲還是哭，索性哭得更高聲點兒。這事情不是糟了嗎？我不敢再説話。我往凉亭外面望，不敢望她。天是暗了，有一隻彎月亮照着那些田。近的遠的，我找不到一點火。一隻狗子站在凉亭外面衝着我望，我記得還是隻黑狗。我們家裏也有隻黑狗我們的牛是黄的，還有一隻黑雞，毛長得好看，想殺牠三年了没忍心殺他。我們遠有隻花貓，妹妹頂愛那隻猫，爹頂恨，説愛偷嘴，可是媽是愛妹妹的，爹是愛我的。那隻花貓偷吃了東西，爹要砍　腦袋，妹妹抱住了不放，爹就打她，　聽見她哭就打我，我一　，爹和媽就鬭起嘴來了。可是爹那去了？媽和妹妹那去了？還有那隻黑狗，那隻黄牛，那隻花貓呢？他們那去了？</p>
<p>我想着想着也想哭，她却不知什麽時候停了的，不哭啦。我把腦袋回過去瞧了瞧，她也趕忙把腦袋回過去，怕難爲情，不讓我瞧她的臉。我便從後邊兒瞧着她。她在那兒不知道在吃什麽，吃得夠香甜的。嘓的，我嚥了口兒黏涎子，深夜裏聽起來，像打了個雷似的。她回過腦袋來瞧，我不知怎麽的嘓的又嚥了口兒黏涎子，她噗哧的笑出來啦，丨我好難爲情丨她拿出個　　來，老遠的伸着肐膊拿着。我也顧不得難爲情，紅着臉跑過去就吃，也顧不得難爲情，紅着臉跑過去就吃，也不敢説話，吃完了便看着她吃，她還有五個。她一抬腦袋，我連忙把眼光歪到一邊。她却又拿了一個給我，我臉上眞紅熱的了不得。</p>
<p>［多謝你］丨我説。</p>
<p>吃完了，她又給了我兩個。</p>
<p>［眞多謝你丨］我説。</p>
<p>［還要不］？</p>
<p>我怎麽能説還不夠呢？我説夠了。</p>
<h3>韓將軍的笑</h3>
<p>— 高明</p>
<p>前一陣我們在報紙上看到。。山東省臨沂縣，有妖匪李樂川，宋王氏，及裁縫師傅寳祺等，自稱天皇地皇人皇，凖備明年三月登基，被官廳捉到了。以一個中國人而抱一點僥倖心理，本來是不足爲奇的。大一點的希望以十塊錢而贏得二三十萬元的跑馬頭獎，小一點的希望以一個銅元而轉到一個橘子或一個糖人，這是我們慣常看見，誰也不訝怪的。所以對於李傅兩先生及宋太太等，我們到不想責備什麽，而我們所感得興趣的，却是它的［後事］。</p>
<p>一直到昨天，報紙才給了我們一個報告（見昨日本報）。。</p>
<p>［韓復榘今晚八點，在省府辦公室提訊僞</p>
<p>宋王氏供多似　語，略謂……韓大老爺准我</p>
<p>保你坐皇帝，如不能，將我大卸八塊。韓大</p>
<p>不敢。……韓以宋王氏係受剌激，神經失常</p>
<p>憫，當諭李回家安分，並勸　人勿信耶敎，</p>
<p>樂川傅寳祺支華慶同時開釋，神牛神樓鑾駕</p>
<p>。（十八日濟南專電）］</p>
<p>宋太太及李傅兩先生等這一次居然蒙韓將軍這樣細心地加以埀憐，固然呌我們不勝驚奇，但我們現在要特别研究的，却還是韓將軍的笑。</p>
<p>據專家的研究，則笑分七種。。</p>
<p>一，生理的笑，如癢笑，嬰兒痴笑是；二。悲哀的笑；三。憤怒的笑；四。病的笑，精神病者的歇斯的里的笑；五，滑稽的笑；六，虚飾的笑；七，喜悦的笑。</p>
<p>我們不知道韓將軍的笑是那一種笑。</p>
<h3>三弦的彈奏者</h3>
<p>— 江天蔚</p>
<p>夜深了，街上漆黑的，没有街燈，也没有行人。天上有三五顆星閃燦着淡淡的光芒。一條狹的街，兩邊的店舖像兩道　，滿街污穢，永遠盪濛着一種臭氣。</p>
<p>在這深夜裏，每天都聽見一個三弦的彈　者，彈着三弦，慢慢的從街的那頭，走到街的這頭，一條長長的街，他老是來回的走着。三弦的聲音老是凄　的響着。</p>
<p>這三弦的彈奏者，在街上來回的彈奏着，已經有七次了。我從他的三弦中知道他是焦急的，一種怨望的情緖，支配着他的手的運動。他先彈着一個快樂的調子，像一個無　慮的人一樣，聲音裏有恣情的笑，有快樂的涙似的。他接着彈着　鬰的調子，沉悶的，悲凉的，似乎是一個寡婚的低泣。這時分，他已經是第四次走過這條街了。</p>
<p>夜更深了，他還是彈着三弦，慢慢的走過街。他是在三條弦上，説出了他的怨望，他的生的悲凉，人間的没有同情。聲音是像山裏的急流，大海中的涙濤，深夜裡寡婦的低泣，沙塲上受傷戰士的呻吟。</p>
<p>我靜靜的聽着，覺得這三弦的彈奏者心上是深深的刻着人生苦的痕跡，他一定是頂了解人間的。這三弦的聲音又從遠處　過來了。我情不自禁的把門打開，走到街上，把那三弦的彈奏者請到我的客堂。他是一個瞎子，滿　風應，映着悲苦的影，他是不分晝夜地彈奏着。我用一種同情的語氣問他道；</p>
<p>［你在深夜裡這樣的奏彈着，不覺得寂寞麽？］</p>
<p>［寂寞！先生！我們瞎子是不知道寂寞的</p>
<p>。］</p>
<p>［你的三弦的聲音告訴我的，唉！我同情你！］</p>
<p>［同情我！先生！謝謝你！我們雖説是瞎子，但是，我是彈着三條弦流浪的，我飽嘗了風吹雨打的苦况，無飲無食斷糧的恐怖，我是。。。。。。但我不忘記我彈着三弦，這是我的生命。。。。。。］</p>
<p>［我想你能得到人們的同情吧！］</p>
<p>［同情我不要。我彈着三弦走過街頭巷尾，無情的小孩用石子擲我，狂妄的惡狗咬我，］</p>
<p>許多人唾我，笑我戲弄我，同情在那裡？我不要！我彈着三弦，訴説人間的不平·］</p>
<p>［。。。。。。］</p>
<p>三弦的彈奏者，聽見我默着不説話了，他便把三弦撥動了，低低的幾聲，逐漸的高着。客堂上一　美孚油燈放射着黯淡的光，三弦的聲音顫抖着。</p>
<p>我支持不住了，這凄厲的三弦的彈奏，　壞了我的心。我輕輕的把五十枚銅子，塞進他的手裏，他驚異的把三弦停着，似乎是感慨的説。。</p>
<p>［没有替先生算命，便受先生的錢，不應該，我不能受這。。。。］</p>
<p>［。。。。。。。。］</p>
<p>［我不能！我如果受了這樣的布施，三弦是要斷的，唉！我不能！］</p>
<p>我能説什麽呢？果然，三弦的彈奏者没有受我這格外的恩惠。他似乎在驚恐着。</p>
<p>第二天的夜裡聽不見三弦的聲音在街上顫動，我以爲他病了，第三天的夜裏也聽不見，第四天第五天。。。。。。。絕響了，這彈三弦的人那裡去了呢？</p>
<p>我是十二分抱恨的，我的同情的心，把個瞎子趕上更遠的征途上去了。</p>
<p>我的心永遠懷念着三弦的彈奏者。</p>
<h3>我所縈懷的妹妹</h3>
<p>— 碧遙女士</p>
<p>三，病殘的落英</p>
<p>落英生長太湖的水濱明眸皓齒，活潑多姿；至於她的文章，更是旖旎𦆑綿，曲折韶秀。她由杭州而上海，求學數年之後，完成了現代女性的典型；在思想上，行爲上，都能解放自已。某次她厭惡了眼前的學校，故意在那一星期的生活報告單上，大書本週最不滿意的事，是破了處女膜。這張紙交到訓育處，引起了翻天大浪，她當然即刻被斥退。其實她那時除了生理敎員在課堂裏講的一些兩性的知識以外，甚麽也不知道。不過她恨那些虚僞的男敎師，表面裝得和尙尼姑一樣，暗地裏却不可聞問，所以她故意開一下玩笑。後來她投考某校，因爲她的卷子出衆，第塲筆試的結果，名列前茅。可是第二塲口試，一位獨身的女敎員，看她態度太活潑，便問她有無男朋友，她即刻回説有的。又問她男朋友現在在那裏？（其意如果隔得很遠，也還不十　要緊）她回廍男朋友不只一個，到處都有。那女敎員呆得再問不下去，只怔怔地瞧了她半天，揮手呌她走開；她便名落孫山了。她在上海各大學演講競賽會上，認旘了一位青年，她馬上寫信給他，進攻他，自動地發展了愛的一切。有時星期日從外面回校，朋友問她那兒來，她便老老實實地説是從旅館來。假如有誰嗤笑一下，她便駡她庸俗。她的　全不庸俗，一切虚僞，顧忌，畏縮，拘泥的言行，一點也不存在。以她豪邁超羣的氣槪，可以創造，可以戰鬥，可以立懦警頑。可惜她後兩年的生活，太無規律，狂飲暴食，縱情逸樂。一方從愛人那兒傳染了肺疾，一方又因堕胎不愼，損失了元氣。近來皮黄骨瘦，已被愛慕者所抛棄，獨自臥病他鄕，那一副憔悴的容顔，令人不復認識。學問固已中輟，生命也不知能支持幾時。所有的知友談到她時，無不同聲太息。</p>
<h3>科學新兵器（二）</h3>
<p>— 逸</p>
<p>第二種可怕的兵器就是電氣砲。這種砲不用火藥，完全用電氣的力量發射彈丸。這是法人福雄比卜勒氏在一九一六年發明出來的。原來火砲的着彈距離與砲彈從砲口飛出時的速度成正一百公斤，着彈距離八百公里。</p>
<p>如果這話一旦成爲事實，則今後世界第二次大戰的時候，法國的敵人便可在遥遠的後方陣地，安然轟擊巴。以前德軍自命爲一時無兩的白爾塔砲的射程也不過一百二十公里，與電氣砲的威力相比，眞算不得什麽。電氣砲的製造價値雖然很高，但在理論上，在實際上，牠的作用都很優良；不過目前還須再行研究，到了眞能實際應用的時候，牠並不會在戰塲上出現。坐在巴黎就可用砲轟擊柏林，倫敦，羅馬。這事不一定是二十一世紀的未來夢，不久的將來也許就會出現的。</p>
<p>長篇創作</p>
<h3>時代与愛的歧路二十</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>到那一頭去好呢？究竟是那一頭重要？任家那邊不能改期的。呌耀星改期吧，提前展後都可以，只要不是五號的下半天。］</p>
<p>他覺得無論怎樣，不能犧牲任家的一頓飯。這不是單爲吃飯本身的問題。而是想再去見見自那天會後給了他以一個十分好的印象的任夫人劉佩珍女士。</p>
<p>以指數北係數，將原有指數减去一幕，便是該變數的微分了。</p>
<p>王敎授的老調子又在唱了。海泉想，這位老師的敎授法眞是不高明。他無心聽王先生的講義了，只望快點響鐘下堂。</p>
<p>他忽然想着鶴子夫人來了。由鶴子夫人便想像到那個日本佬和鶴子夫人親暱的情形。於是在他的腦裏子又起了一陣的憂鬰。</p>
<p>［怕什麽！我衣袋裏還有一個紙團呢。］</p>
<p>他伸手進衣袋裏去摸了摸那個紙團，忙自寬自慰，很想就取出來看，又担心坐在後面的姓朱的同學會偷看。</p>
<p>好容易挨過了四個鐘頭，響了十二點。下半天只有一點鐘的軍事訓練，他是不願意再留在這個乾燥無味的學校裏了。</p>
<p>在主觀上，他眞不想回會公館去，但是客觀的環境迫着他非走那一條路不可。</p>
<p>坐在電車裏，把卓女士擲給他的那個紙團拆開來看。</p>
<p>［海泉同學］。我住北四川路Ｈ路Ｓ里十五號。茲有要事奉商，今晚八時左右，迄移玉至敝寓一叙，勿却爲幸。］</p>
<p>他眞想不出卓淑華約他到她家裏去是爲什麽事體。他只想，試去看看她吧。回到曾公館的門首，傾耳向廟面聽了一下，是靜沉沉的，不見有什麽聲息。他是預期着鶴子夫人一定會站在門首迎他的。但看現在的情形是絕望了。他使勁地推了推後門，裏面並没有　，門，門扉應着他的一推，打開了。娘姨聽見門響，才從前面的客堂裏揉着眼睛走出來。</p>
<p>［林先生，這早回來了？］</p>
<p>［少奶奶呢？］</p>
<p>海泉免不住要這樣地問她。</p>
<p>［上半天和那個東洋先生出去了。］</p>
<p>［只他倆去？］</p>
<p>［還有那個漂亮的日本姑娘。］</p>
<p>給娘姨一説，海泉又想起今早上看見的立在鶴子夫人身後的年約十五六歲的美麗的日本姑娘來了。</p>
<p>［林先生没有吃飯吧。少奶奶把林先生的點心准備好了才出去的。］海泉聽見後，心裏又暗暗地在感謝鶴子夫人了。他回到三樓的房裏坐了一忽後，娘姨便端上了一大碗冬菰鷄肉麵來給他吃。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>圈點</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>近來本刋談言，新標點不用，竟用起圈點來了，圈點是從前文章家的拿手好戲，什麽大開大呀丨什麽酣暢淋漓呀丨用得着大圈而特圈。，現在這種放屁式的談言，（在這廟應當聲明的，這是我做的談言如此，他人的談言是例外，）圈點什麽，眞是十足表演申報六十歲的大姑娘。態度，難則裝得千嬌百媚，珠翠滿頭，三寸金蓮，繡花大袖。［顚不剌的見了萬千，這般可喜娘罕曾見，］但究竟失去時代性。一般封建色彩太覺濃厚，决不能與幾位［摩登密司］去競賽。，　　眞的，談言决不與幾位長旗袍短大衣的摩登小姐競賽。也不敢與摩登小姐競賽，加些圈點，不過是［不棄我取］［廢物利用］的一種好奇的觀念羅了，［　痢頭的兒子自已好］，我也人類，天然逃不出這種普通心。理，故任何人駡我的文章，十分惡劣，二十分的不通我雖不敢妄自，菲薄，自甘屈服，但亦决不［敝帚千金］自鳴得意的［一詠三嘆］拍案呌絕，也决不敢自吹自擂，什麽古文家，什麽新文學家，什麽是傳世驚人的作品。</p>
<p>陳冷先生説過，做文章如排洩餘孽一般，排洩後决不再回頭去看看，是硬是軟。是香是臭，我也與陳先生同一宗旨，無論所放的屁怎樣惡劣醜陋。决不回頭去看，但是麻面姑娘，偏要塗脂抺粉，掩蓋掩蓋她的繡花面孔。，這也是麻子姑娘的普通性，故頴川陳黯曾有詩曰，［天憐未端正。滿面與妝花。］話雖如此，也無非是一種文過飾非的論調罷了。本刋加些圈點。或也是麻子大姑娘矯揉造作的用意，也未可知，這是我敢承認的。</p>
<p>話又説轉來了，但是開倒車也不是生意經，譬如一個人，總得向前面光明的路走，决不要向後轉，做時代的落伍者，眞的，誰願開倒車，誰願做落伍者，的確是個溫生，是個阿木林，但試睜開眼睛看看，自政府以至社會，自軍閥以至站在門口的巡警先生，自要人以至於［抛頂宫］的小　三兄，那一個那一處不發現開倒車向後轉的例子，譬如結婚，𠺗哩嗎啦的小堂名也有，富麗堂皇的軍樂隊也有，裏面高懸黨國旗，外邊高高　起一對堂名燈，這都是一種普通矛盾的把戲，加些圈點，又發生甚麽關係呢</p>
<p>又試間，加圈點果然是落伍的麽？不加圈點果然是摩登的麽？進化與退步，陳腐與摩登，果然僅僅分别在圈點上麽？倘果眞如此，的確如此，分别在這一點上，那末，我也何樂而不去掛了羊頭，賣些狗肉，戤戤摩登的牌頭，但是所謂新標點也者，也無非仿照西文的點句罷了，但西文的點句，我輩以爲新，在歐美早成陳跡，也不能説絕對新奇可喜的事，并且張冠李戴，是否［七寸半的帽子正好戴一也是問題，這樣説下去未免太囉囌了，還是快些收束的好，總之，在現代的事，總不能去澈底地去根究，摩登也好，陳腐也好，馬馬虎虎罷</p>

<h3>稻草製造棉花法</h3>
<p>— 一蘅</p>
<p>棉花一物，是世界日用必需之品，本屬天産，今世界界文明各國，皆有人工造成者，所用原料是農家廢棄之物，如稻草或桑皮均能製造，又不用大資本，所用器具，家家都有，如（鍋，蘿，桶，盒，等物）所用藥料，各處藥房及藝器館均有，今先將稻草製造棉花法，列述於後。。</p>
<p>稻草　　一百斤（指揀凈者）</p>
<p>苛性曹達（即燒碱）九斤四兩</p>
<p>硫酸（即硫强水）一斤七錢二分（分二次）</p>
<p>潥白粉十二斤四兩</p>
<p>（一）先將稻草去稗草，用刀削去草根穗，剥去草葉，將中段切斷，約長二三寸，預備用之，不分糯粘，皆可用之惟以常年白嫩新稻草爲佳，陳及霉者，萬不可用。</p>
<p>（二）用清水入鍋中煑沸將苛性曹達（Ｓｏｄｉｕｍｈｙｄｒｏｘｉｄｅ）投入水中，俟其溶化，再將稻草徐徐投入，用棒攪匀，煑爛爲度。</p>
<p>（三）將煑爛稻草撈起，放漏水竹籮内，用清水冲洗，如有不爛者，揀去搗之，復放清水内，揀去霉草及草節絞乾。</p>
<p>（四）用冷水一缸將硫酸（ＳｕｌｆｕｒｉｃＡｃｉｄ），六兩另八分傾入，化成淡硫酸，將草絨放入，浸一刻鐘，取起絞乾扯鬆。</p>
<p>（五）用清水將漂白粉（ＢｌｅａｃｈｉｎｇＰｏｗｄｅｒ化開，去其石灰，再加熱水攪匀，即將絞乾草絨放入，用木棒攪匀，蓋一晝夜，即成潔白草棉（注意）漂白石灰，倘不除，去則不成棉。</p>
<p>（六）用清水一缸，將硫酸十兩六錢四分傾入，化成極淡之硫酸，再將漂白之草絨，用清水洗一次，絞乾放入硫酸内攪匀，露放一小時，去漂粉臭氣，再用清水洗之，絞乾，放日中，晒至七成乾，扯開，再晒至十分乾，彈開則成潔白之棉花能。</p>
<h3>一封悲壯激越的信</h3>
<p>親愛的敏妹；</p>
<p>我寫這封信的時候，本不想告訴你的，但是不告訴你終没有一天再得與你</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>申報本埠增刊</p>
<p>説了！况且早晚終脱不了被你知道的，所以還是告訴你吧！</p>
<p>自從那天在火車站離開了你，當時胸中充滿着生離的難過，然而想到是爲了民族的榮辱，國家的存亡，我心裏頓覺欣然了！</p>
<p>我們的義勇軍一直開發到東北！到了馬將軍的部下，他們很歡迎，因爲我們在學校裏都受過相當的訓練，所以立刻就派一部任後防擔任警備，一部赴前線去！</p>
<p>我當時也派在前線的一隊裏，當我們臨陣的時候，嗖嗖不斷的槍聲，　進我們的耳鼓，我們雖然都是些未經戰塲的青年但熱血在沸腾着，絲毫没有感到畏懼，我們只是眼睛很敏的望四面窺着，預備矮兵的來臨！</p>
<p>第二天的早晨，義勇軍的團長命我們特别小心戒備，因爲聽説敵人有一部份從鎭轉入我們的戰線，同時他們再派十幾個富有戰爭經騐的弟兄，充實我們的防線。</p>
<p>傍晚。細碎雜亂的槍聲，夾着那陣後轟轟的大砲，不絕的放着。果然有幾輛戴着矮兵的戰車，直冲進我們的陣線，當時團長命令衝鋒時，我們就很奮勇上去抵抗，矮兵都跳下了車來與我們肉搏，雖然我腿上已中了幾彈　我那時却絲毫没有學得，我們的勇氣似乎更利害了！結果矮兵死去了一半！其餘多逃了。可是我們的弟兄也死得不少了，這一次的衝突，我也殺了幾個矮兵，眞痛快的！</p>
<p>敵人又增兵了一刹那間，又來了許多，這時我們的同學陳君，被一個矮兵殺死，這增加了多不少的憤怒，我們正在追擊的時候，天空間似乎有飛機的盤旋，接着便有一個東西，落在我們的附近，轟的一聲，我便不省人事了。</p>
<p>及至醒來已臥在醫院的病楊上，身上滿了被炸傷的痕跡，敏妹呀！我的右腿也被炸去了，醫生囑我安心些，大約不行了呢？在最短的時間内我要死了，所以我忍痛的寫這封信，也許你見這封信時，我已經舍着笑死了！</p>
<p>敏妹呵！你不用爲我難過，我爲了國家的存亡，民族的榮辱而死了。</p>
<p>祝你快樂！親愛的敏妹！</p>

<h3>農夫的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 張一萍</p>
<p>自從畢業後，在上海東奔西走，没有回故鄕去過。目前爲了田地上的事回家兩天。農塲上堆起了柴薺，農夫們一年辛勤，到這時才是休息的時候；况且今歲又是豐年。在幻想着在農塲上放了一隻矮的桌子，一家老小都圍攏來吃夜飯。從夕陽下山吃到天黑。敢是他們最快樂的時候吧？</p>
<p>我們的村上，完全保存以前古樸的風氣。如其某人家有紅白事，全村的人都來帮忙，彼此像自家人一樣。我回家的晚上，晚餐後，隔壁的老伯伯照例握着一支水烟袋，一根特别長的紙吹，嘴裏咕嚕着到我家來談天。他是個老的小孩子，從前我在故鄕的時候，他會和我們拔繩，捉麻雀。有時更會買一二銅元糖食嚼嚼。所以我聽見他的脚步聲，就跨出門外拘他進來。</p>
<p>老伯伯没有從前的精神健旺，也没有從前的笑顔常開。在煤火燈前坐下之後，他先嘆了一口氣，突如其來的問我；［這一次同日本人打仗，損失不少吧？］</p>
<p>［不少，聽説共幾百萬萬啦！］</p>
<p>［眞何苦，中國人那廟打得過日本人；］老伯伯像合於邏緝的説；［小少爺，你不知道這裏還要築飛機塲，這村上的人嚇得都搬了家…］他搖搖頭，抽了一口烟。</p>
<p>［報上説没有築成啊！］</p>
<p>［是呵！可是這裏幾千畝田都糟了！還有人家的墳都翻了起來，前清法律，掘墳要殺頭的。］</p>
<p>［這許多田到底怎樣辦法？］</p>
<p>［幸虧收回成命的時候早，現在也收了榖。］</p>
<p>［那就是啦，能夠豐年，就别管這許多了。］</p>
<p>［小少爺，收成確是好，可是米價會這樣的賤，倉裏（即田主）即不肯减低代租。（故鄕習慣，由農夫糶米之後，以代價師還田主）鄕下人有什麽辦法。］</p>
<p>［老伯伯，你有自種的田啊！］</p>
<p>［自種田也不見好，糧税一年年加重，如其荒年，拿什麽去完糧！］他隨説隨抽烟，一根特别長的紙吹，已剩了僅僅哥以握在指間的一段。我知道他將要起身走了，果然他站起來結束他的説話。。［種人家的田不好，種自已的田也是不好，鄕下人眞要命啦！］</p>
<p>悲哀的情緒，完全籠罩着他的有皺紋的臉上。</p>

<h3>寫信給友人之妻（十一續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>這種種含有多量的血涙的笑話，便絕不費事的增加了同學們對於周李戀愛事件的注意。同時，無論男同學，女同學，都在替大經担心；因爲他們倆人的性格，地位，環境，委實相差得太遠了。大經所特長的是學識，可是學旘之於十九世紀，早給姑娘們輕視得不値半文錢了。因此，大經之必爲李芳所棄的預言，早給同學們蓋棺論定了。</p>
<p>這種預言大經那時候也未嘗不聽得，尤其是我，更不怕煩瑣的常以良友的資格，丨這一個資格，一直保留到在西華德路會見了你，才自動的消滅掉。丨向他竭盡規勸，不過他正深深地沉醉於李芳的巧笑倩兮之中，對於我那些話，自然都當做過耳秋風了。</p>
<p>因爲他迷戀得這樣深，所以在後來失戀之後，他簡直像喪失了他的靈魂一般的痛苦了丨</p>
<p>誰料到他三年前所喪失的那顆靈魂，忽然會和我劈面相逢起來。可是這時候的我，却已不是大經的良友了，已是一個險些把他第二顆的靈魂，又奪走的損友了。</p>
<p>［密司脱朱此刻在那裏辦事？］我雖然是一個很能説話的人，不過這一晚的精神着實不濟，好久，想不出一句話和她敷衍。倒是她先問起我來。</p>
<p>［唔！……我嗎？我是，……］不料她第一個問題，就問得我不能答復。要是前一天她問我，那就可以很容易的把大豐洋行答復她；此刻呢，我在六小時前，早把大豐的職務辭掉，還能説在那裏辦事呢？我囁嚅了半响，才揑出一個謊來；［在口大敎書。］</p>
<p>［啊！口大的校長不是ＸＸＸ嗎？上半年他們原想請我們馬先生去的，］我平空揑的謊，倒開動了她的話匣。［他因爲自已已經担任着口學院的院長，又知道口大是出名的窮學堂，所以便不曾去。你在那裏担任什麽功課？担任了多少時候了？］</p>
<p>［這樣説，你現在是馬濟川博士的夫人了。失敬得很！］我撇過了她問我的話，先把她所説的［我們馬先生］五個字，下了個註解。</p>
<p>她是極得意地笑着。可是在得意之中，彷佛還有一些虚心</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友！你不是時常駡我是世界上最壞的壞蛋嗎？你的意思是和我説笑，其實却是眞的！我不但壞，而且又會猜測人家的心事。李芳的話，和她這一種含有虚心的病態，在我的惱神筋上轉了幾個圈子之後，我立刻便明白這件事情的眞相了。</p>
<p>［馬濟川的夫人是歐陽錦明女士，時常在女青年會逗留。李芳大槪是不幸做了他的如夫人了！］腦神筋工作後的報告。</p>
<p>［噢！馬太太！原諒我，讓我問你一句話。］我準備攖住她這一個送上來的機會，取笑她一番；也算替大經也些寃氣。［馬博士和那一位常給女青年會辦事的歐陽女士，是在什麽時候離婚的？］</p>
<p>這一問，眞使她窘透了，她立刻低下頭去，反兩片鮮紅的嘴唇，貼在玻璃杯的口上；她半响。不能發出一些聲音來。臉部逐漸的赤化，像喝醉了酒樣。</p>
<p>她這麽一窘，越發証實了我的腦神筋底報告；我是得意極了，差一些就要笑出聲來。</p>
<p>畢竟她是一位女交際家，雖然出其不意的受了我這一窘，但是過了五六分鐘，便漸漸地恢復原態了，她先把兩支流利的眼波，含着一種怨恨的情調，向我閃了幾閃，然後很大方地一笑。</p>

<p>影界珍聞</p>
<h3>散蘇碧慈是喜劇家麽？（上）</h3>
<p>— 福倫</p>
<p>散蘇碧慈的滑稽，使小孩子們看見了她，就拍手大笑起來，這是的確可以同卓别靈分庭抗禮。但是散蘇究竟是不是一個吉劇家，這是値得討論的，據好葉塢一位名導演曾説過這幾句話；［他們都呌散蘇碧慈扮演喜劇的角色，不知當代一位最偉大的悲劇作者，就此埋没了］。</p>
<p>要知道散蘇碧慈究竟是喜劇家或是悲劇家，請先研究研究她半生的事蹟。有許多事情，是許多人不知道的，我且記述在下面</p>
<p>散蘇初次到好萊塢，遠在十三四年以前。那時她的孤苦伶仃，正如一隻喪失母親的小貓；她自已知道她的相貌並不動人；她亦没有性的誘惑力。找事？那可没有散蘇的份。她住在一個小俱樂部裏，眼睜睜看了許多嬉笑浪漫的女明星，飄來飄去，覺得心内的羨慕渴望，如火似的燃燒着。人家看她可憐，想要去同她作朋友，但她反而害怕得不敢仰望。但是有一位仁慈的佛蘭西斯馬林先生，終究給了她些事做，使她作曼麗璧克馥的配角，這就是散蘇碧慈影戲生涯的第一幕。</p>
<p>這件事眞是散蘇女士的一生造化，因爲從那天起，她纔知道世界上還有眞心賞識她的人，她就不再自已對自已懷疑了。那時好萊塢每逢星期四的晚上，就舉行一次跳舞會。散蘇頭一次參加跳舞會，就遇見了託姆加勒利。託姆在百十位美麗女郎之中，看中了這但碧慈女士。他請她跳舞。他説她有性的誘惑力。後來碧慈女士就嫁了這位加勒利先生。他們過了幾年的快樂家庭生活。不幸加勒利心情變了，碧慈受了多少委曲，一直到受不下夫了以至於要離婚。</p>
<p>散蘇碧慈，係一位天生的悲劇家。她天性是傾向悲苦的；她的見解亦係悲苦的；她並且歡喜聽悲苦的故事。有一次好萊塢夜間法庭問一個被蹂躪女子的事跡，散蘇碧慈竟陪坐聽了一夜。她自已説她最歡喜聽這種赤裸裸人生悲慘境遇的陳述。她對於感覺生活悲苦，以及靈魂上的飢餓的人，她能設身處地的深表惺惺相惜的同情。</p>
<p>但是散蘇的待人接吻，係極甜蜜的。好萊塢的人們，對於散蘇碧慈的待人的好處，係口碑載道的。名女伶巴伯拉勒瑪死了，留下一個孤苦無依的螟蛤女，散蘇碧慈動了惻隠之心，將那孤女領了過來，使她毫不感到前母與後母，究竟有什麽分别，這是好萊塢傳頌諸事蹟之一。（未完）</p>
<h3>李邨巴塞爾瑪斯</h3>
<p>ＲｉｃｈａｒｄＢａｒｔｈｅｌｍｅｓｓ是表演最好的男明星了，他近作是［一鞭之仇］ＴｈｅＬａｓｔ今天起就在卡爾登大戲員開映呢！</p>

<h3>（一）電影員另闢新途徑</h3>
<p>— 燕</p>
<p>曁南公司的［爲國爭光］聲片，自從在杭州攝去外景之後，内景無形中就停頓開拍，據説是收音機發生問題？這問題也就是錢財問題？那麽這些職演員在空閒的時間就想了一個生財之道，組織了一個電影歌曲的戲劇社。昨天他們在集中影業貿易公司開了一次討論會，議定社名呌“ＩＳＩＳ”［綠洲］歌劇社，聽説有歌喉明星李麗蓮參加，並由陳大悲編劇，胡旭光繪製佈景及設計舞臺裝置，ＡＣｌａｒｉｎｓ的樂隊，及八個舞女，陳歌辛指導歌唱，及配譜，陸福　顧文宗等導演，王春元陳一棠等主演，仰天樂等設計服裝，陳寳琦的配光。</p>
<p>在今天，王乃鼎已經在南京，無錫，蘇州，去接洽公演的戲館，上海，則待演習純熟，再行公演云。</p>
<h3>（二）捲土重來的［四壯士］</h3>
<p>— 慕珠</p>
<p>上海中日戰事纔結束後，有一部以對抗［西綫無戰事］爲號召的德國戰事名片在卡爾登開映。它的名字，大約諸位没有忘記呌做［四壯士］ＥｏｕｒＩｎＦａｎｔｒｙＭｅｎ。當時因爲十九路軍以後援不繼而退却了，給日兵進佔許多地方的原故，人人都抑悶得要命，所以很想看戰事片來洩那口寃氣。結果［四壯士］的賣座力非常可觀。正所謂塲場客滿，閧動一時呢。</p>
<p>聽説［四壯士］將掷土重來，在上海開演。照我的意思，還値得一看。虹口的電影迷盍興乎來。</p>
<p>影星瑣聞</p>
<h3>李萍倩的一頁小史</h3>
<p>— 陸亞生</p>
<p>李萍倩是現代的一顆導演明星，由天一而轉入明星公司。他的作品很多，毌容在下來贅述；現在我所要説的，記得在七八年前的事吧！這時候，他還在嘉興秀州中學校裏念書，我呢？不過是和他同校，並不是同級。</p>
<p>他在校的時候，讀書不十分聰明，但生性活潑，喜於動，不近於靜，並且酷嗜戲劇。因此；對於功課方面，考得不十分高。記得有一個學期，他不過爲了數學不及格，而被校方退學。但是，他呢？並不懊喪和怨恨，便跑到上海來，轉輾而入影片公司，才有現在的地步。所以，我記得在求學的時候，時常聽敎員們説着，無論做什麽事情，終要努力去做，不要怕做，失敗者成功之母，果然。</p>
<p>我並不是來破壞李君的名譽，實在是佩服他的勇敢，給於我們的一個敎訓。在下現在雖也在向藝術的路上走，不過；我還希望李君走到最前線。</p>
<p>名著譯述</p>
<h3>銀幕之面（上）</h3>
<p>— 鈍若譯</p>
<p>那在地道旅行中的影片編製員瓊哈乃士菲力潑偶然從報紙上昂起頭來，他瞧見了那坐在他對面的婦人，眞使他的手指都冷起來了，那婦人名呌阿埋特立加而司基，你不猜出她的年齡，她看起來眞像一個憂患的化身。不僅是那慘白而没光澤的頭髮圍在她瘦削頺喪的臉傍，使他驚恐，她臉上的無數縐紋，搭在提袋上多節的手，破舊的鞋子以及那件打了補釘的衣服，都使他深受剌激。然而使他最爲靈感的，還是她眼睛裏蘊蓄着的絕端的遲鈍，無生氣和絕望的表現。他把眼閉了一會，想把她給與他的影像排除，但是就在這一瞬間，一個創造的念頭很熱烈的在他思潮中發生。</p>
<p>忽然，他正在編製的一張新片中擁擠了羣衆的一幕，湧入他的心靈，這片子名呌［深淵的呼聲］，他看見一羣黑壓壓的像他面前的婦人向樓梯上衝去，於是中間一個丨就是現在坐在他對面的　獨自離開了她們，很悲慘地走過羣衆和樓梯隔開的一個短距離，這羣狂亂的婦人在她後面推上來，他張開了眼才明白他是在地道裏，他走向這婦人半高聲的説；</p>
<p>［你願意去見一見這卡片上寫的一位先生嗎？吾想他能給你很好的工作］，他的話停了一會，才貫進她的感覺，她仍没向上看，末了她才問。。［是不是做散工的麽？］</p>
<p>［不是，丨丨是一件很好的工作，待遇很高，你到了那裏他們自會詳細地和你説的，］　　［你知道吾有一個用工的職業，每天一小時七十分尼薪水，不過這位置將没有了，辦事室快關門了，丨丨吾喜歡做散工。］（未完）</p>
<p>明星公司有聲片［自由之花］，上月份該片在光陸大　院試映，各報上已經有着很好的輿論了。下圖係［自由之花］中胡蝶夏佩珍吃醋打架之一幕，該片不日起演於南京大戲院。</p>
<h3>童話影片</h3>
<p>— 繡翖</p>
<p>［飛行大使］（ＡｉｒＭａｉｌＭｙｓｔｅｒｙ）係環球公司的新出品，該片取材於西方童話，共二十大本，這種故事，差不多專給歐美兒童看的，所以，那衷的兒童，都能唯唯的講給你聽，頭頭是道！正好似我國的兒童，他們都能講童話中的，［飛行車］，［三姊妹］，［玻璃鞋］等，但，據聞南京電檢會諸公，一再重檢，至今視爲疑案！其實，童話能使兒童作課後的消遣，那麽，賢明的檢查諸公，决不會以神怪荒誕視該片了！况且，此種影片，絕對非荒唐不經者！我想，在最短期間，一定能通過，同時，可以作許多兒童在聖誕節中的娱樂了！（却酬）</p>
<h3>陳玉梅的小名更正</h3>
<p>— 天一來稿</p>
<p>昨日本報載陳玉梅的小名呌寳寳，實屬不確，她本姓費，小名呌夢敏，她的父親是已故名醫費純甫，便是孟河派的宗師，她在五歲時，她的父親逝世後，就移住在蘇州城内費氏别墅中生長，所以她祇會説吳儂軟語，後來十四歲來滬，入電影界，人以其年徲，呌她寳寳，並非她的小名。十六歲轉入天一公司，時胡蝶在天一主演珍珠塔影片，她入天一主演三笑姻緣影片，二片先後告竣，營業之佳，　非他片所及，於是她倆的聲譽，遂漸著於影界。（却酬）</p>
<p>電影專著</p>
<h3>戰勝自已</h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>柏拉圖曾經説過，［第一最偉大的勝仗就是戰勝自已；被自已征服的人是萬般之中最羞恥最下殘的事。］</p>
<p>我不知道拍拉圖曾經練過表演藝術没有，曾經看見過訓練表情的程序没有。如果他自已不會表情，他這句話，把他自已也駕到裏頭去了。如果他不能夠不受環境的支配，要笑就笑，要哭就哭，他本人就是一個被自已征服的人了。</p>
<p>我在上面屢次説過，研究表演藝術的人應當像司機人一樣，把自已面部的筋肉訓練得運轉自如。在没有攝影塲經騐的人看起來，這不過是一句極平淡無奇的話。等到他對鏡一試之後，他纔知道這種訓練的價値了。表情的訓練是甚麽？就是拍拉　所謂的［戰勝自已。］</p>
<p>你的面部筋肉不肯受你的意志的支配，戰勝自已的工作當然不能認爲已經完成。因爲這個緣故，不論你要以演劇爲職業與否，你都應當利用對鏡子照自已的臉的時候，練習面部表情。這就是完成你的［戰勝自已］最後而且最要的一種工作。除了存心要做隠士的人之外，面部表情是人人所應當［學而時習之］的。面部筋肉不受你心理的支配，你在無形中不知道要受到多大的損失呢！你在談話的時候，你的心竭力要向對方表示誠意，不幸你的眼光偏在那裏，表現遊移和懷疑的態度，你想對方將受到如何的印象？</p>

<h3>Proposals Regarding the Political Council</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The proposal from the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee to convene a National Political Council on a regular basis and to stipulate the essential points of its organization is as follows in its entirety:</p>
<p>For the purpose of proposing the regular convening of a National Political Council and stipulating the essential points of its organization, submit to the Standing Committee for thorough preparation so that public opinion can be concentrated and political tutelage can be completed as soon as possible. The establishment of a central public opinion organ has been a long-standing determination of our party. Since the Generalissimo advocated convening a National Assembly, although time has passed, we have not forgotten it day and night. Therefore, the Third Central Executive Committee, adhering to this legacy, convened a National Assembly after the national unification to formulate the Provisional Constitution of the Period of Political Tutelage, in order to establish the initial rules for constitutional governance. When the national crisis suddenly arose, our party comrades and compatriots across the country increasingly felt that unity of purpose was necessary to resist aggression. Echoing each other, the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Executive Committee resolved to hold a National Salvation Conference, and the National Crisis Conference resolved to hold a National Congress. In response, the Central Government, on the one hand, followed the principles of the above resolutions, and on the other hand, followed the spirit of the Generalissimo's Outline of National Reconstruction. At the 309th Central Political Council meeting, it was resolved that [the central public opinion organ during the Period of Political Tutelage shall be named the National Political Council]. At the 322nd Central Political Council meeting, it was resolved that [the final decision-making power regarding the resolutions of the National Political Council belongs to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. The organizational essentials and division of powers shall be drafted by a drafting committee, and after a discussion, the provisions shall be drafted based on the decided plan]. However, the National Political Council is an initial rule for the trial implementation of constitutional government during the Period of Political Tutelage, and it must be carefully and thoroughly considered before its foundation can be consolidated. Rather than hastily drafting something to satisfy temporary desires, it is better to make extensive investigations so that it can be implemented without flaws. Therefore, there are still several essential points that urgently need to be decided by the congress, which are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The National Political Council shall be convened within the year 1933.</p>
<p>(2) The generation of representatives to the National Political Council shall involve both election and appointment methods.</p>
<p>(3) The powers of the National Political Council shall be based on the Provisional Constitution of the Period of Political Tutelage and shall take into consideration the various points raised by the Central Political Council and the National Crisis Conference.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding all laws and regulations of the National Political Council, the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee shall formulate, promulgate, and implement them in accordance with legislative procedures within four months. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of Japanese Intellectual Circles' View on Peace in the Far East</h3>
<p>According to telegraph dispatches, recently, thirteen newspaper companies, including the Japanese Asahi and Mainichi, in the name of Japanese intellectual circles, issued a declaration announcing their opposition to the draft resolution of the Five-Power Conference. They stated that for the Far Eastern situation to stabilize, the stability of Manchurian politics must come first. The stability of Manchurian politics lies primarily in recognizing the so-called Manchuguo. Recognizing Manchuguo is the foundation of peace in the Far East. Japan will never agree to any resolution opposing the independence of the puppet state of Manchuguo. Such extremely arrogant and unreasonable statements could be issued in the name of the entire Japanese intellectual community. We sincerely lament this for the Japanese intellectual community. We are well aware that this type of [so-called public opinion] is merely a mouthpiece for their military cliques and a tool for military clique-controlled militarism. However, biased words confuse the world, and we cannot but subject it to a solemn refutation.</p>
<p>In the declaration of the Japanese so-called intellectual circles, they say "peace" once and then "peace" again. Is this so-called "peace" for the peace of the world, or for the peace of Japan alone? If it is for the peace of the world, then we dare to ask the Japanese intellectual circles, what is the cause of the unrest in the Far Eastern situation today? Before the September 18th Incident, was the Far Eastern situation as turbulent as it is today? Was it such that the nations of the world turned pale at the mention of it, as they do today? It was only because Japan single-handedly created the September 18th Incident. For the past year, its aggression against us has intensified, and the Far Eastern situation has suddenly fallen into an extremely uneasy tragic situation. World peace and justice have both suffered severe threats. These facts are most evident. All fair-minded people in the world can see them clearly. Therefore, today, if one wishes to bring stability to the Far Eastern situation, one must abolish the puppet state of Manchuguo, withdraw Japanese troops, and restore the situation to what it was before September 18th of last year. Only then can all disputes be eliminated and the foundation of world peace be further consolidated. Yet, today, the so-called intellectual circles of Japan completely obliterate the facts of the past, reversing cause and effect, and claiming that recognizing the independence of the so-called puppet state of Manchuguo is the foundation of peace in the Far East. We truly do not know on what basis this logic is based, and we are even more unaware of where they intend to place the dignity of the intellectual community as they forcibly connect and willingly act as the mouthpiece of the Japanese military cliques.</p>
<p>According to the meaning of the Japanese so-called intellectual circles, their so-called "peace" is merely the peace of Japan alone. To put it another way, it means that all countries in the world should follow the will of the Japanese and let them do as they please. Establishing the puppet state of Manchuguo is for peace; denying the puppet state of Manchuguo is against peace. If we deduce from this proposition, then if Japan, after monopolizing the puppet state of Manchuguo, were to create another puppet state in Siberia, would it not make the Far Eastern situation even more stable? Or, if it were to advance southwards by sea and establish a puppet state in the Philippine Islands or Singapore, would not world peace be even more eternally stable like a rock? Is this truly the interpretation of peace? If Japanese intellectual circles were to take a moment to ponder and reflect, could they not help but smile in embarrassment?</p>
<p>The establishment of the so-called Manchuguo was achieved by the Japanese forcibly seizing a corner of Chinese territory and monopolizing it. Even the Lytton Report has clearly recognized that Japan, in order to monopolize the puppet state, has not hesitated to pour out its national strength, dispatch large armies, and expend countless lives. Is this truly based on a fair position to support the independence of [Manchuguo]? If it were truly so, then under the iron heel of Japan, there are already the two nations of Korea and Taiwan, who are striving for independence but cannot achieve it. Why must Japan abandon what is near to seek what is far? The two nations of Korea and Taiwan, under the protection and support of the Japanese, have now been permanently reduced to the tragic tombs of lost countries and broken families. Today, the Japanese are repeating their old drama in our Northeast and saying that it is for peace, and that it is to support neighboring countries! Alas! Can the eyes and ears of all fair-minded people in the world truly be covered with one hand? Even if Japanese intellectual circles want to cover up the ambitions and atrocities of Japanese militarism, they will only further attract the common disapproval of fair-minded people all over the world.</p>
<p>However, we are well aware that today's affairs do not lie merely in empty debate. What use are words under the coercion of violence? Moreover, from the beginning of the outbreak of the incident, we have long decided that the Northeast problem can only be resolved after we restore the normal state of our Northeast. Until today, we still believe that only when Japan abandons its so-called Manchuguo under its monopoly can all disputes between China and Japan be resolved, and then world peace can be realized. These facts cannot be achieved by empty debate. We must do our best to seek them.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations at a Loss</h3>
<p>The Special Committee of Nineteen is scheduled to meet this morning. Discussions on the Sino-Japanese case are likely to be postponed until next spring.</p>
<h3>The Drafting Committee is Seeking a Compromise to Save Face</h3>
<p>The Great Powers Only Know How to Follow the Wishes of the Japanese. The Invitation to the United States and Russia is Expected to be Changed to an Unnamed Method. The Organization for Non-Recognition of the Puppet Manchuguo is Intended to be Lightly Let Go. (Geneva) The Drafting Committee of the Special Committee of Nineteen, which is engaged in drafting a proposal regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute for submission to the League of Nations Assembly, met this afternoon for a period of three quarters of an hour before adjourning. It is heard that the Special Committee of Nineteen is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning. After this meeting, the Sino-Japanese problem will be formally postponed until the beginning of January. However, this does not mean that discussions will be completely suspended during the recess. An organization will be established to continue negotiations during the formal recess period. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Attempts by the League of Nations to mediate the Liaoning case have encountered significant difficulties. Both the Chinese and Japanese governments seem to have concerns about the methods proposed by the Committee of Nineteen and cannot readily accept them. The opinions of the two governments regarding the proposed resolution have been telegraphed to Geneva and communicated to the Committee. Although they have not been published at this time, it is heard that both countries have raised points of firm opposition. The Japanese are demanding the deletion of all articles mentioning Chapters Nine and Ten of the Lytton Report, while the Chinese are insisting that the resolution formally declare that the League of Nations does not recognize [Manchuguo]. Under these circumstances, it is feared that all mediation efforts by the League of Nations will be fruitless. In addition, opinions within the League of Nations Assembly are also highly divided. Representatives of small countries are now insisting that the time has come for the League of Nations to declare its principles on its own. Therefore, it is heard that the Committee of Nineteen is currently busy seeking another compromise in the hope of at least temporarily saving the face of the League of Nations. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese response to the draft proposal was submitted to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, this afternoon. The Drafting Committee has given it preliminary consideration, but due to the absence of the Swiss representative, Huber, it has been decided to postpone further discussion until Monday afternoon. This will allow all members of the Drafting Committee to attend before the meeting of the Executive Council is held at 4:00 PM tomorrow to consider the dispute over the British-Persian oil concession. It is heard that the Japanese response opposes several points in the draft proposal but insists on mediation procedures based on actual facts and not on academic theories, such as the establishment of an international gendarmerie in the three eastern provinces. It is also heard that the Japanese response raises the issue of the United States and Russia being non-member states of the League of Nations. Japan also opposes 1) the draft proposal mentioning the current situation, 2) the last sentence of the explanatory memorandum, and 3) the mention of the Nine-Power Treaty. The League of Nations believes that the Japanese government has misunderstandings regarding certain points in the draft proposal and is currently working to negotiate in order to eliminate these misunderstandings. It is heard that after explaining the matter clearly to the Japanese representatives today, the Japanese representatives telegraphed Tokyo for instructions. It is hoped that the response from Tokyo will arrive tomorrow, at which time the situation should be clearer than it is today. It is heard that the Japanese opposition to Chapters Nine and Ten of the Lytton Report focuses on paragraphs seven and eight of Chapter Nine. The League of Nations believes that if a mediation mechanism is to be established, the current discussion should be limited to general principles. As for the objections raised by Japan above, they can be raised within the mediation committee itself. (Reuters, 18th) (Geneva) It is widely expected that the Lytton Report and the entire issue of the Sino-Japanese dispute will be postponed for two weeks until Tuesday for further discussion. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The mediation efforts of the Five-Member Drafting Committee with the Chinese and Japanese delegations have made progress for the first time tonight, and it is no longer possible for the Five-Member Committee to disappoint in getting the Chinese and Japanese to agree on the resolution of the Committee of Nineteen. The current obstacle is not whether to invite the Soviet Union and the United States to participate in the future mediation committee, as the Soviet Union has no intention of undertaking this matter. The Five-Member Committee intends to use an unnamed method and only reserve the right to invite one of these non-League members to participate if necessary. As for the opposition of the Committee of Nineteen to recognizing [Manchuguo], which was originally the main point of disagreement, it is now intended to modify the original method, so the disagreement seems to have been slightly reduced. The draft resolution is intended to merely recall the recommendations listed in the Lytton Report, declare that restoring the original state is impossible, and state that the proposed methods must take into account the current realities. However, it may still take time and effort to establish a resolution that is acceptable to both parties. It is generally believed that the General Assembly will not be able to meet and finalize the draft resolution until around January 15th of next year. The Committee of Nineteen still intends to meet once before Christmas, on Tuesday or Wednesday, to consider the draft resolution in light of the above situation. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Our Country Will Hardly Accept the Draft Resolution</h3>
<p>The League of Nations' Failure to Change its Pro-Japanese Attitude Leaves No Way Out</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, the draft resolution drafted by the Committee of Nineteen differs greatly in the opinions of China and Japan. Whether or not to recognize [Manchuguo] is the focus of contention, and both sides are absolutely unwilling to compromise. As for inviting the United States and Russia to participate in the mediation meeting, it is not a fundamental issue. The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the draft proposal must be revised. If the content of the revision does not improve and is even more unfavorable to us, then we will have no reason to accept it. It is now believed that the Committee of Nineteen is in a predicament and may postpone the meeting until next year for further discussion. However, if the League of Nations does not change its pro-Japanese attitude, there will be no way out. (Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Stubborn Attitude</h3>
<p>Actually Wants Us to Abandon Manchuria as a Condition for Negotiations</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japan's stubborn attitude actually states that negotiations can only be conducted if China is willing to abandon Manchuria. Therefore, those engaged in mediation work in Geneva are greatly disappointed. The Special Committee of Nineteen is scheduled to meet tomorrow. The General Assembly of the United Nations must be held until the beginning of January next year. (Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Foreign Ministry Rejected Drummond's Proposal</h3>
<p>Instructing Matsuoka to Persist to the End (Tokyo) Matsuoka Yosuke telegraphed the Japanese Foreign Ministry yesterday, reporting on Drummond's compromise proposal and requesting instructions. Foreign Minister Uchida convened a meeting of bureau directors today to discuss the contents of the telegraph. It is reported that the Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that Drummond's proposal is a partial modification and still differs greatly from Japan's policy, and therefore cannot easily agree to it. Foreign Minister Uchida telegraphed Representative Matsuoka tonight at 8:00 PM, instructing him to persist to the end in accordance with the instructions of the 17th. (Hua Lian News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Representatives Are Mobilizing Fully</h3>
<p>Actively Working Separately with Representatives of Various Countries. Matsudaira Has Returned to His Post in England. (Geneva) After receiving instructions from the government, the Japanese delegation decided on its final attitude towards the draft resolution. Although the 18th was Sunday, all members went out to visit the drafting committee members separately and worked hard to persuade them to accept Japan's position. Vice-Minister Sugimura even met with Drummond, Ambassador Matsudaira visited the British representative, Plat, and Representative Sato and Representative Nagaoka consulted with the French and Spanish members respectively, explaining the Japanese government's views on modifying the resolution. Representative Matsuoka also met with the Swedish representative, stating the Japanese position and requesting understanding. (Lian She News Agency, 19th) (Geneva) Japanese Representative Matsudaira, the Ambassador, returned to his post in England at 11:00 PM on the 18th. (Dentsu News Agency, 19th)</p>

<p>On April 29th of this year, in Jinzawa, a Korean criminal named Yoon Bong-gil threw a bomb at the Tencho-setsu celebration ceremony in Shanghai's Hongkou Park, killing General Shirakawa and the Chairman of the Administrative Committee, Kawabata, and seriously injuring Minister Shigemitsu and Commander Nomura. After his guilt was confirmed and he was sent back to the mainland, he was escorted to Jinzawa and executed by firing squad at 7:40 AM today. (Dentsu News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>France's Attitude Towards Japan Changes</p>
<h3>Japanese Diplomacy Falls into Isolation</h3>
<p>Small Countries Unite to Uphold Justice. Matsuoka Will Travel to England and Italy to Lobby.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, the Japanese government's response to Representative Matsuoka, maintaining the Manchurian status quo, has been submitted to the Committee of Nineteen by Matsuoka. However, the French representative, who has always strongly defended Japan's views, is very dissatisfied because Japan has never been willing to make the slightest concession. Representatives of various small countries have also observed that France's attitude towards Japan has obviously gradually changed. They have all united to be tough on Japan, demanding that the League of Nations uphold justice and not be a tool of Japan. As a result, Japan's diplomatic position in the League of Nations has once again fallen into isolation. Matsuoka and others are very anxious and have been calling emergency meetings of representatives from last night until this morning and reporting this situation to the Japanese government to request further instructions. (Far Eastern News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Since the fall of the Herriot cabinet, France's attitude towards Japan has suddenly changed dramatically, and the anti-Japanese atmosphere is very strong. Japanese Representative Matsuoka feels great difficulty in League of Nations diplomacy due to the loss of France's protection. From now on, the only countries that can be expected to provide assistance are England and Italy. Matsuoka is now planning to travel to London and Rome on the 21st to lobby England and Italy in the hope that they will assist Japan at the next General Assembly if the 22nd Assembly does not open. (Far Eastern News Agency, 19th) (Geneva) Japanese Representative Matsuoka Yosuke plans to depart from Geneva within the next few days and travel to England, France, and Italy to explain the difficulties of Japan's policy of aggression. It is heard that Matsuoka's lobbying strategy will focus on the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia as the warp, and the League of Nations' interference in our internal affairs as the weft, in an attempt to win the favor of the major powers and beg for tacit approval of Japan's rights of aggression in the Northeast.

<h3>Liu Wenhui's Representative Denies Liu's Telegram to Zhang Qun</h3>
<p>Recent Bloody Battles Multiple Times in the Rongxian Renshou Area (Nanjing) Liu Wenhui's representative, Leng Rong, made a statement that the situation in Sichuan is complicated, and the tricks of sowing discord are endless. The previous report in the Shanghai newspaper publishing Liu's original telegram to Zhang Qun contained many fabrications and was not true. Zhang Qun did not receive this telegram, and the Shanghai office did not receive the above-mentioned telegram either. It is likely that someone forged it to sow discord between our army and the Twenty-Ninth Army. Their efforts are futile and not worth laughing at. That is, our army and the Twenty-First Army are currently engaged in fierce battles in the Rongxian Renshou area. There have been multiple bloody battles recently, and they have progressed from the vicinity of Qingshen Jiading to the vicinity of Shuanggu Cemetery, Laojuntai, Changshan Bridge, and Lijiachang in the vicinity of Rongxian, advancing more than a hundred li.

(Central News Agency, 19th) (Nanjing) Sun Ke reported at the Memorial Week, saying briefly, that the central issue of this Third Plenary Session is to seek how to enable all comrades to unite as one and make preparations for national salvation and resistance. The people of the whole country are also constantly striving for national salvation, but based on past facts and experience, national salvation cannot be achieved without active resistance. When the Northeast Incident occurred, it was initially believed that the League of Nations could uphold justice, but now the League of Nations has compromised and given up, causing those who hoped for it to despair. The mission of the Third Plenary Session is to increase the strength of resistance and to develop a plan for unity, to concentrate national strength under the leadership of the Party, and to strive forward.

<h3>Mutō Prepares to Seize All Police Power in the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) Mutō, the plenipotentiary, is even more ruthless in his means of subjugating the Northeast. Recently, he intends to seize all police power in the puppet organizations throughout the Northeast and put it under the control of the Japanese. The method has been largely decided: the Police Administration Department, which belongs to the puppet Ministry of Civil Affairs, will be reorganized under the puppet Ministry of Military Affairs or an independent department, and a large number of police and military police will be transferred from Japan and from the Japanese police and military police in South Manchuria to replace them, in order to facilitate the implementation of all administrative measures to subjugate the Northeast.

<p>The League of Nations that Resolves Disputes?</p>
<h3>Accepting the Anglo-Persian Oil Dispute Case</h3>
<p>The British Empire is Impatient. The Persian Representative is Unable to Attend. Will Invoke the Precedent of the Liaoning Case to Send an Investigation Team. National News Agency, Geneva, 19th. Although the Persian representative strongly advocated for postponing the discussion to await the arrival of Persian experts, the League of Nations is expected to invoke the precedent of the Lytton investigation before the League of Nations Executive Council meets on Monday to discuss the case of the D'Arcy oil concession between Britain and Persia, and send a special investigation committee as an initial solution. Persia has stated that it is willing to provide various conveniences to the special investigation team, and before the case is resolved, it will respect the current situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 18th. British Foreign Secretary Simon is currently suffering from a cold in London and cannot go to Geneva. Therefore, when the League of Nations Executive Council handles the Anglo-Persian oil concession dispute tomorrow afternoon, the person representing Britain to present the case will be Mr. Malkin, Legal Advisor to the British Foreign Office. It is heard that the Persian government will not have a representative in attendance tomorrow, so this meeting will only be a formality.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 19th. The League of Nations today released a document issued by Persia on the 17th, complaining that Britain is using intimidation and threats in the dispute with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but does not object to submitting it to the League of Nations Executive Council, only requesting the Executive Council to postpone detailed consideration of the case until the Persian experts arrive in Geneva. At the same time, the League of Nations also released a 30-page statement by Britain, accusing Persia of canceling the concession as a unilateral act of confiscation in violation of international conventions, and requested the League of Nations to take appropriate steps to maintain the status quo and prevent the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company from being damaged during the Executive Council's consideration.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 19th. The British government submitted a statement this morning to the League of Nations Executive Council regarding the Persian government's cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's D'Arcy oil concession, stating that Britain is extremely willing to resolve this dispute through a peaceful and fair agreement. However, the Persian government believes that this concession can be canceled by unilateral action, leading to a failure in negotiations. Therefore, it requests the Executive Council to take necessary steps to 1) maintain the status quo, and 2) prevent damage to the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company while negotiations are not yet completed. The statement also stated that the British government is submitting this dispute to the Executive Council in its capacity as a government, not as a shareholder, to protect its nationals from damage to their interests due to another country's violation of international conventions. The original contract between the company had provisions for submitting disputes to arbitration, but Persia actually canceled this contract, although it indicated that it could grant the company a new concession in principle. The statement also stated that Britain sent a note to Persia on December 2, stating that the cancellation of the contract was an unacceptable action, and that the British government attached great importance to it and requested its immediate withdrawal. If Persia ultimately confiscates the company's assets, it will cause significant damage to the company and create an extremely serious incident. According to the contract, Persia should protect the company's assets, but Persia is not responsible for any losses to the company, so the British government is very concerned.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the French Left-Wing Cabinet</h3>
<p>Peng Gu Serves as Premier and Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Most Former Members Retained</p>
<p>Maintaining Previous Cabinet Policies</p>
<p>Socialist Party Refuses Cooperation Due to Political Differences</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 18th: Peng Gu has formed the French cabinet. Peng himself will serve as Premier and Foreign Minister; Republican Democratic Socialist Party member and former Justice Minister Sérol will serve as Finance Minister; Radical Socialist Party member and former Premier Chautemps will serve as Interior Minister; Democratic Left-wing member and former Agriculture Minister Senator Queuille will serve as Justice Minister; Radical Socialist Party member and former Minister of Public Works Daladier will serve as Minister of War; Republican Left-wing member and former Premier Leygues will retain his position as Minister of the Navy; former Premier Painlevé will retain his position as Minister of Air; Democratic Left-wing member Sarraut will retain his position as Colonial Minister; Radical Socialist Party member Dali Mayo will retain his position as Minister of Labor; former Minister of Posts Bonner will serve as Minister of Public Works; Radical Left-wing member and former Minister of Air Eynac will serve as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs; Mayor of Le Havre, Méyer, will retain his position as Minister of Merchant Marine; former Minister of Posts Queuille will serve as Minister of Agriculture; the Minister of Budget has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 18th: After the list of new cabinet members was announced to the press by the new Interior Minister Chautemps, the new Premier Peng Gu issued a declaration stating, "[The new cabinet is an extension of the Herriot cabinet, as can be seen from the list of new cabinet members. The policies of the new cabinet will be further demonstrated in the future.]"</p>
<p>Sérol's appointment as Finance Minister further demonstrates the government's desire to reveal the true state of finances to the people and to take necessary measures. The new cabinet will hold its first cabinet meeting at the Ministry of War tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 18th: The Socialist Party's reasons for not wanting to cooperate with the Peng Gu cabinet are no more than the following: after lengthy discussions between the two sides, they failed to agree. The main points are: (1) Regarding the 40-hour work week system, Peng Gu said that it should be determined according to international plans and cannot be determined by France alone; (2) Regarding the national monopoly of the insurance industry, it is not appropriate to implement it at present due to psychological factors; (3) Regarding budget balance, a fair method should be used to require all classes of people to uniformly endure sacrifices; (4) Regarding the supervision of banks, Peng Gu advocated following the original conditions set by the Herriot cabinet; (5) Peng Gu believed that insurance for unemployment and agricultural disasters was too costly; (6) Peng Gu believed that national stability could not be guaranteed internationally by any means other than military preparations, so military spending could not be reduced for a single day. However, the term of military service, from one year to eight months, should be reviewed as soon as there is an opportunity. These are the points on which the Socialist Party and Peng Gu could not agree. However, although the Socialist Party will not participate in the Peng Gu cabinet, it is still willing to assist in Peng Gu's policies. The conditions for its assistance are the same as before for the Herriot cabinet. Therefore, those directly assisting the Peng Gu cabinet are the Radical Socialist Party, the French Socialist Party, and the Left-wing Radical Party. As for the Right-wing, the Republican Democratic Federation, and the Communist Party, they stand in opposition.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 19th: France's new Peng Gu cabinet is truly radical in nature. Among the seventeen cabinet members, twelve belong to the Radical Socialist Party. In addition, Peng Gu himself is non-partisan; Navy Minister Leygues has served in the naval departments of both left and right-wing cabinets and can be considered a naval expert, but he also belongs to the central left-wing; Finance Minister Sarraut is a former cabinet member of the Poincaré cabinet and is joining a left-wing cabinet for the first time, but he still belongs to the Republican Party; Minister of Posts Eynac is a radical left-wing member; Minister of Air Painlevé belongs to the Republican Socialist Party. Furthermore, judging from the backgrounds of the new cabinet members, no fewer than twelve are members of the bar association, which can be called a cabinet of lawyers. In addition, six have served as university professors, five as journalists, two as doctors, one as an agriculturalist, one as a civil servant, and one as a publisher. Among the new cabinet members, twelve have served in the old Herriot cabinet. However, there are also six ministers and vice-ministers who are serving in a cabinet position for the first time. As for those who have served multiple terms and can be called cabinet experts, in addition to Navy Minister Leygues, there are Agriculture Minister Queuille, Minister of Merchant Marine Méyer, and Minister of Air Painlevé, among others.</p>
<h3>Peng Gu's Brief Biography</h3>
<p>Good Friends with the Late Foreign Minister Briand</p>
<p>Creator of the "War Potential" Theory</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 18th: The new Premier Peng Gu participated in a cabinet before the war and recently served as Minister of War in the Herriot cabinet. Although he has been in the cabinet twice, this is the first time he has served as Premier. Peng Gu is nearly sixty years old and was previously a lawyer in the criminal court, with a high reputation. His political life has been largely devoted to the Socialist Party. Last year, he left the party due to disagreements on the issue of arms reduction. Peng has been a member of the Paris Chamber of Deputies for a long time and was later elected as a Senator. After the establishment of the League of Nations, Peng Gu often assisted the French Premier in attending the League of Nations. In 1924, when Herriot advocated the "General Protocol for Arbitration, Security, and Disarmament" in Geneva, Peng Gu also participated in it. Later, when Briand shouldered important diplomatic responsibilities in Geneva, Peng's assistance was also significant. Peng and Briand were close friends. The concept of "war potential" is known throughout the world, and Peng Gu is the creator of this theory. Peng Gu created this theory while working on the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference. Peng Gu's so-called "war potential" means that when assessing a country's ability to wage war in peacetime, one should not only examine its existing military forces but also consider other factors, such as population productivity, industrial resources, etc. For example, a steel bell on a door may seem unrelated to war, but when war comes, it can be used to cast bullets. This is the so-called potential ability. After Briand's death, Peng Gu succeeded him as France's permanent representative to the League of Nations. Soon after, he was invited by Léry to join the cabinet as Minister of War. Peng has a pale face and no beard and often wears a black tie with white flowers. Because he resembles Robespierre during the French Revolution, he is called Robespierre by contemporaries. He is skilled in debate and speaks clearly. He has a long-standing reputation among international figures.</p>
<p>Japan Adopts the Old Trick of Annexing Korea to Conquer Our Northeast</p>
<h3>Sakatani to be Appointed as Director-General of the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Chinese United News, Tokyo, 19th: The puppet organization's "Grand Emperor" Komai Tokuzo was driven out of office by the warlords for advocating so-called "royal way" principles and advocating respect for the opinions of the Chinese people. The position of "Grand Emperor" has remained vacant ever since. The Japanese government believes that the League of Nations will eventually yield to Japan and that world public opinion is not to be feared. Therefore, its policy of annexing the three northeastern provinces is becoming increasingly blatant. It is reported that the Japanese cabinet intends to appoint Baron Sakatani Yoshiro, a member of the House of Peers, to serve as the "Grand Emperor" of the puppet organization. The names of the "Chief Secretary of the Puppet State Council" and the "Chief of General Affairs of the Puppet State" will also be changed. Or, the old trick of Ito Hirobumi's governance of Korea will be implemented again, and the title will be changed to "Director-General of Political Affairs of the Puppet State." This is currently under study.</p>
<h3>Immigrants Utilize Prison Labor</h3>
<p>Chinese United News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The Ministry of Justice of Japan's planned mobile prison system is said to have been finalized. The content is to select benevolent prisoners from all over the country and transfer them to Hokkaido and our three northeastern provinces. Hokkaido's climate is unsuitable, and the three northeastern provinces are dangerous to life. Benevolent people are unwilling to go there easily, so this strategy is being used. Serious offenders are being used as the vanguard of aggression.</p>
<h3>Aggression Relies on Buddhism</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 19th: Abbot Otani Kozon of the Higashi Honganji Temple, who resumed his religious affiliation not long after his bankruptcy problem was resolved, has decided to cross over to Manchuria to promote amity between Japan and Manchuria through missionary work. He arrived in Beijing a day or two ago and has obtained the understanding of the military and foreign affairs authorities. It is scheduled to be realized in early January. Regarding this, an official of the Higashi Honganji Temple told someone that the former abbot's trip to Manchuria to promote reconciliation between Japan and Manchuria is a very good thing. The sect is currently working hard to open up Manchuria, so it is very welcome.</p>
<h3>Recruiting a Large Number of Puppet Officials</h3>
<p>Chinese United News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The Japanese Ministry of Education today issued a ministry announcement to recruit 200 puppet officials. The content of the announcement is that anyone who wants to go to the puppet state to serve as a puppet official must enter the Datong Academy to first learn Chinese and the affairs of the three northeastern provinces. The term of study is six months. The qualifications for taking the exam are graduates of Japanese universities or vocational schools in March 1933 and 1930. However, they must have a certificate from the president of the school proving that they are Japanese who are healthy, have stable thoughts, and do not harbor opposition to imperialism. The reporting period is from December 20th to January 20th. The location is the Bureau of Specialized Academic Affairs of the Ministry of Education. School will begin on April 15th. The Japanese are forcibly running "Manchukuo" as an independent country, but the right to recruit puppet officials is in the hands of the Japanese Ministry of Education. The qualifications for recruitment are also limited to Japanese, which can be said to be extremely self-contradictory.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 19th: The Shanghai Special District Court has been repeatedly mentioned during the meetings of the House of Commons in recent weeks. It was discussed again today. Conservative MP Lenn urged Foreign Secretary Simon to consult with other treaty countries in order to inform China as soon as possible that the Special District Court urgently needs reform and to indicate the scope of the reforms needed. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden replied that there are still three months before the current agreement expires. The government can take various appropriate measures, such as consulting with other signatory countries, to ensure that the matter is completed before the expiration of the agreement. As for Lenn's suggestion that the British government should instruct the British representative in Geneva to request that the sections of the Lytton Report that mention the internal situation in China and those that mention the three northeastern provinces be given the same attention, Eden did not agree.</p>

<p>Dentsu News Agency, Kyoto, 19th: The cause of the three-way train collision on the Tokaido Line east of Kyoto Station this morning is now known to be heavy fog, which caused the freight train to misunderstand its stopping position.

<p>Provisions of the Independence Bill</p>
<h3>Filipinos Express Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>To Launch a Boycott of American Goods</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th: The Senate inserted a clause in the Philippine Independence Act requiring Filipinos to vote on the constitution and removed the clause stating that the United States would only withdraw its sovereignty over the Philippines after Filipinos voted in favor of independence at the end of twelve years. The Senate's move may lead to a presidential veto. According to a dispatch from Manila, the Philippine Citizens' Association has declared that if the bill passes, Filipinos will definitely reject American goods.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 18th: After consultation by the conference committee of the two houses of Congress, it is expected that the Philippine Independence Act will be returned to the two houses this week. The original bill in the House of Representatives had a provision for convening a citizens' assembly to vote on independence. It is now expected that it can be completely deleted because senators believe that since Filipinos have organized a constitutional convention to formulate a constitution, it is sufficient to express their attitude towards independence. There is no need to convene a citizens' assembly to save the Philippine government a huge amount of expenses. It is also heard that members of the House of Representatives now agree to delete the clause on the citizens' assembly.</p>

Cai happened to be invited by Li Peitian, President of the Cultural College, to serve as the Director of Academic Affairs of the College in October.

<h3>Guangdong Province Plans to Establish Wengjiang Hydroelectric Plant</h3>
<p>The Expenses Will Be at Least Six Million US Dollars; the Entire Project Will Take Approximately Six Years to Complete</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Beijiang River in Guangdong meanders through the mountains, and the power of the waterfalls between the valleys is extraordinarily great. The authorities had long considered building a hydroelectric plant. It was not until recently that a plan was drafted and submitted to the Southwest Political Committee for review by members Lin Yungai and Liu Jiwen. The review has now been completed and submitted to the Technical Committee of the Construction Department for design and implementation. The preparation plan is as follows: The Wengjiang River is a tributary of the Beijiang River, joining the Beijiang in Yingde. The hydroelectric plant is planned to build a dam near the Shuikou area of ​​Wengyuan County, approximately 90 feet high. A power plant will be built under the dam, using 66,000 volts to transmit electricity to Guangzhou and other places. According to engineers' estimates, the water volume of the Wengjiang River during the dry season is 2,500 cubic feet per second. If the water storage capacity upstream of the dam is utilized, 3,000 cubic feet per second can be obtained during the dry season, and 5,000 cubic feet per second can be obtained during normal times. Building a 90-foot dam will result in an effective head of 80 feet, yielding 16,400 horsepower during the dry season and 14,784 kilowatts of electricity. During normal times, 36,666 horsepower can be obtained, yielding 20,536 kilowatts of electricity. As for the construction engineering: 1) Water source: Utilize the stream valley upstream of the dam, approximately 50 zhang long. 2) Water intake: Use a direct internal diameter of 20-foot tunnel to divert water. 3) Underground power plant: Use reinforced concrete to build a water pressure chamber 20 feet wide and 150 feet long, with a sand and mud discharge outlet at one end. 4) Dam: The upper part is 20 feet thick, the base is 80 feet thick, 110 feet high, and 500 feet long, all made of concrete. 5) The water immersion area upstream of the dam will occupy approximately 200 mu of paddy fields, 200 mu of pine forests, and approximately 300 mu of forests, affecting approximately 30 households, with losses of no more than 5,000 yuan. The power plant will be built on both banks of the dam, approximately 500 feet away from the dam. The generators will use five machines with a capacity of 1,000 kilowatts each. The electricity generated by the generators, approximately 6,600 volts, will be sent to a special high-voltage room, transformed into 66,000 volts via seven single-phase step-up transformers with 3,500 kilowatts, and then transmitted 13 miles to Guangzhou, where seven single-phase step-down transformers will reduce it to 3,300 volts. As for the start-up costs, equipment costs, and capital, approximately 6 million US dollars will be required. However, according to estimates by the Canadian Fellisby Company, 10 million US dollars will be required. The preparation engineering is divided into four phases. The first phase is limited to three months for surveying. The second phase involves designing the dam site and the machinery and equipment for the entire plant. The third phase involves sending letters to factories in various countries for bidding. If it is not completed within a year, an engineering office will be established publicly for design and construction, which will take approximately one year to complete. The fourth phase involves supervising various constructions and installing machinery, which will take four years. The entire project is expected to be fully completed in six years.

<h3>Hunan Province Divides Areas to Inspect Opium Prohibition</h3>
<p>The Entire Province Is Divided into Fifteen Districts, with Special Commissioners Assigned to Assist in the Prohibition Policy</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since the establishment of the Opium Prohibition Committee in Hunan Province, opium dens in Changsha City have been closed separately, and native opium establishments have also been closed in accordance with the order. All unsold special goods (i.e., opium) are stored in a transfer station and twelve warehouses, responsible for transportation and sales. As for the counties that have always grown opium, the military and political leaders of the respective regions are strictly ordered to eliminate them within a time limit. The Chen Quzhen unit stationed in western Hunan is given a subsidy of 40,000 yuan per month by the provincial government to abolish the opium seedling tax in order to implement the prohibition of planting. All opium offenders caught in the counties are sentenced to imprisonment and no longer released on fines. Therefore, although the handling has only been two months, the atmosphere in all areas has changed. According to reports, thirty-seven counties, including Pingjiang, Zixing, Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, and Hengyang, have established opium abstinence centers. Thirty-one counties, including Yongming, Ningyuan, Hengshan, Changning, Hanshou, and Jiahe, have no opium seedlings or have been eradicated. The remaining counties are currently conducting separate surveys and eradications. The committee recently learned that opium prohibition inspectors dispatched by the Third Provincial Bandit Suppression Headquarters will soon come to Hunan to investigate and determine the opium prohibition situation in each county and whether opium seedlings have been completely eliminated. It is necessary to conduct an on-site inspection in advance to avoid delays. Therefore, the entire province is divided into fifteen districts, with one inspector and one secretary assigned to each district to be responsible for supervision in the respective areas. The divided areas and the responsibilities of the inspectors are as follows:</p>
<h3>Areas</h3>
<p>(First District) Inspector Liao Hequn, Secretary Liao Bingkun (covering six counties: Changsha, Xiangyin, Yueyang, Linxiang, Pingjiang, and Liuyang).</p>

<h3>Han Fuju Personally Interrogates Li Lechuan</h3>
<p>Wooden Ox and Wooden Royal Carriage Are All Displayed in the Provincial Government Hall, Resembling a Theater</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The case of the demon people Li Lechuan and others, captured by the Special Task Force of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau in Houyingfang a few days ago, had been detained in the prison for more than ten days because Han Fuju was inspecting Jiaodong and had not yet returned to Jinan. Last night, Han returned to Jinan, and this morning (17th), he brought the case to the provincial government for personal interrogation. At around 8:00 AM, the Public Security Bureau escorted the false emperor Li Lechuan, the false earth emperor Fu Binqi, the false empress Song Wangshi, and the carpenter Zhi Huaqing from the prison to the provincial government. Thousands of people lined the streets to watch. When Li and others arrived at the provincial government hall, they trembled in fear, their faces pale. Han's wife, sons, and daughters all came out to watch. During the interrogation, after roll call, the divine ox was carried up, and the clothes in the box and the so-called accompanying royal carriage were displayed one by one. For a moment, the hall was bizarre and colorful, like a theater. According to Li Lechuan's confession, he believed in the Big Dipper Sect and had no ulterior motives. When asked what the strange clothes were for, he confessed that they were for dressing up for the Lantern Festival in the first month. When asked what the divine ox was for, he confessed that it was for display in the ancestral hall. At this time, the Director of the Public Security Bureau reported to Han that the cult was being investigated and banned in Changqing, Linyi, and other counties, and that there were official documents for arrest. Then, he ordered Li Lechuan and others to be returned to prison to await individual interrogation at a scheduled time. At around 10:00 AM, they were sent back to the Public Security Bureau from the provincial government, and the crowd was even more crowded. (December 17th)</p>

Now, the precautions for investigating and prohibiting opium planting are issued, hoping that you will comply and instruct your subordinates to comply. Before the special commissioners arrive, the precautions that belong to the special commissioners should be handled by the provincial chairman; those that belong to the commissioners or members should be handled separately by the administrative inspectors and the county magistrates. This is hereby telegraphed. Chiang Kai-shek's seal.</p>
<h3>Precautions</h3>
<p>(A) Before opium seedlings are planted: 1. The special commissioner, together with the provincial government, prints and distributes vernacular announcements to various counties for widespread posting. 2. The special commissioner publishes a vernacular booklet, which the Department of Civil Affairs orders the counties to distribute to the district offices and educational institutions for separate lectures. 3. The special commissioner, together with the provincial government, appoints commissioners or members to go to various counties to print and distribute a brief notice stating "Strict Prohibition of Opium Planting is Ordered; Violators Will Be Executed" and post it in all villages. 4. The commissioner or member, together with the county magistrate, supervises the district office to hold a large meeting on prohibiting opium planting, inviting representatives from all sectors of the party, government, military, and education to attend, holding open-air lectures or organizing propaganda teams to give separate lectures, and sending people to parade through the villages with announcements and notices, beating gongs and drums. The commissioner or member should personally attend the meeting with the county magistrate in areas where opium has been planted more frequently in the past. 5. The commissioner or member, together with the county magistrate, supervises the district office to instruct the township leaders or Baojia leaders to admonish each household and obtain a pledge stating that if they dare to plant opium, they will accept the death penalty, and submit it to the county government for preservation. For places where it is considered unnecessary to have a pledge, it may be exempted, but it must be submitted to the commissioner and the provincial government for verification. The form of the aforementioned pledge is determined by the Department of Civil Affairs and ordered to be printed and distributed by the counties for use. 6. The commissioner or member conducts spot checks on various districts. If the implementation is ineffective, the district chief shall be punished in consultation with the county. If the county magistrate fails to handle it effectively, it shall be reported secretly to the special commissioner for verification. 7. The commissioner or member reports the work situation on a monthly basis for verification. (B) When opium seedlings are planted: 1. The special commissioner, together with the provincial government, issues a general order to the counties to supervise the district offices to divide the opium planting area in the district into several sections, ordering the township leaders or Baojia leaders in or near the section to patrol in rotation. If opium planting is found, it should be eradicated immediately, the opium seeds confiscated, and the planters sent to court. For desolate areas where there are no township leaders or Baojia leaders to designate, the district chief should send people to patrol. 2. The district chief should assess the diligence of all levels of personnel under his jurisdiction at any time and inspect them personally. Those who fail to perform their duties should be reported to the county for punishment, and the inspection situation should be reported to the county for verification. 3.

<h3>Letter of Opinion from the League of Nations Engineering Expert on the Plan for the Huai River Project</h3>
<p>Guiding the Huai River Is the Primary Problem in Improving China's Economy; Water and Drought Disasters Can Be Avoided After the Completion of the Entire Project</p>
<p>The Huai River project is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The Huai River Commission previously drafted a plan for diverting the river to the sea and submitted it to the National Government for approval and record. The National Economic Council also considers the Huai River project to be the primary problem in improving China's economy. In the winter of last year, it invited four League of Nations engineering experts, led by Mr. Haas, the director of the League of Nations Water Conservancy and Communications Section, to inspect the rivers in the Huai River basin for a week, accompanied by Xu Kai, the deputy chief engineer of the Huai River Commission. They also provided opinions on the plan set by the Huai River Commission and made a report. The report of the League of Nations engineering experts to the Economic Council on the plan for the Huai River project is excerpted below for the reference of those who are concerned about the Huai River problem.</p>
<p>The Huai River basin is located between the Yellow River to the north and the Yangtze River to the south, with an area of approximately 270,000 square kilometers. The Huai River originally had its own outlet to the sea. However, between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Yellow River breached its banks near Kaifeng and seized the drainage route of the Huai River. The Huai River had to find another way out. In 1852 (i.e., the fifth year of the Qing Dynasty's Xianfeng reign), although the Yellow River moved north from Kaifeng, the downstream of the Huai River could not restore its original course due to silt deposition and the high riverbed. Therefore, for hundreds of years, the Huai River has suffered frequent disasters because it does not have a wide and smooth channel to discharge floods.</p>
<p>In order to prevent this disaster, many plans for guiding the Huai River have been proposed in the past, but many of them can be set aside because they are based on insufficient data. Moreover, the limit of the difference between the drought flow and the extreme flood situation of the Huai River has been determined more accurately in recent years. It is also deeply understood that the purpose of guiding the Huai River is not only flood prevention, but also irrigation and navigation. It is deeply felt that the key lies in making full use of the Hongze Lake to store water, so as to obtain all the practical benefits. There is no other method that can be as perfect and effective as this to reduce the maximum discharge of the Hongze Lake downstream and the water disasters it has suffered in the past. At the same time, this method can be used to store water for irrigation and navigation in years when summer rainfall is abnormally reduced. Therefore, the plans that did not know how to use this natural reservoir to obtain such extremely important benefits can also be set aside. In the first phase, the main problem is how the excess floodwater of the Huai River is discharged from the Hongze Lake: 1. Is it to the Yangtze River via the Sanhe River and the Gaobao Lakes to Sanjiangying? Or 2. Is it to a certain river, roughly east, directly leading to the sea? However, with appropriate economic conditions, both methods can be used in later periods, and the situation can still be improved and made safer.</p>
<p>The committee members have studied the engineering plan of the Huai River Commission and the multi-volume documents and materials compiled by it. With the invitation of the National Economic Council, they personally inspected and surveyed the Huai River from a certain point above Huaiyuan to Hongze Lake, and inspected the proposed dam sites near Jiangba, Hongze, and Huaiyin, and inspected many river channels and abandoned river channels. They also traveled south from Huaiyin along the Grand Canal through Gaobao Lake to Shaobo and the Yangtze River. The colleagues did not have the opportunity to meet with Li, the chief engineer of the Huai River Commission, which is regrettable. However, when the colleagues were stationed, Li was handling important projects elsewhere. However, they had a joint discussion with Hui Xukai, the acting chief engineer of the commission, and he provided the necessary explanations. He also accompanied them on a field inspection from Bengbu to the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The engineering department of the Huai River Commission has conducted detailed research on the terrain of the basin and the records of the water level and submerged areas during the long periods of extremely large floods in 1916 (the fifth year of the Republic of China) and 1921 (the tenth year of the Republic of China). Later, in 1930 (the nineteenth year of the Republic of China), it was decided that the maximum flood volume of the Huai River flowing into Hongze Lake was 15,000 cubic meters per second, which can be fully adopted as the basis for designing flood control projects. After considering the records of the 1931 (the twentieth year of the Republic of China) flood, the colleagues speculated that there was no need to modify the decision. It should be explained that in years of extremely large floods, including 1931, the Huai dikes above Hongze Lake were breached. The aforementioned maximum flood volume was not obtained through direct measurement, but was obtained through various calculation methods. After fully considering the maximum flood volume that can occur after the implementation of the upstream dikes and straight river projects of the Huai River, the colleagues were not entirely satisfied, but in other respects, the calculation method was still appropriate, and the number of 15,000 cubic meters per second was in fact reasonable and sufficient. It is also said that if the maximum flood reaches 15,000 cubic meters per second, according to the records of 1921 (the tenth year of the Republic of China), the flow rate will only exceed 10,000 cubic meters per second for a period of about 30 days.</p>
<p>Based on this assumption, the flood control projects required above the lake should be designed according to the maximum flood volume of 15,000 cubic meters per second, gradually decreasing upstream. However, the gates and dams that control the discharge of water at the lake's outlet should be planned entirely based on the maximum water volume that can be accommodated by the outlet and the downstream drainage channels.</p>
<p>First, regarding the part of the Huai River upstream of Hongze Lake, the Huai River Commission plans to build dikes along the main stem of the Huai River, with a distance of about 3 kilometers to 4 kilometers between the two dikes, straighten several tributaries, and appropriately merge closely adjacent tributaries. The Huai dikes that should be built and extended to the tributaries should also be built. In addition, there should be other ancillary projects to improve navigation and irrigation, which are planned to be implemented later, so there is no need to discuss them in this report.

<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Imprisonment for Fraudulent Schooling and Extorting Money</p>
<p>Yesterday, three travelers resembling students, Li Qingtang, Zhou Xuexia, and Ren Yuzhi, arrived at the Huaqing Inn in Xuanhua Ward of this county. After renting rooms, they immediately went around soliciting donations, claiming to be establishing a "People's Livelihood School" in Shanghai. Many people donated for a time. The matter was discovered by Qin Jieren, the Director of Public Security, who suspected the affair. He dispatched Officer Zhang Ruofu to lead police to bring Li and the others to the bureau for interrogation. It was determined that they were extorting money under the guise of running a school. They were immediately sent to the county government. After the trial, Zhou and the other person were sentenced to fifty days in prison. Ren Yuzhi was released immediately because he was young and acted blindly.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Farmers in Disaster Area Request Exemption from Arrears Rent</p>
<p>You Wenhuang, Zhang Zifu, You Wenji, and others from Yangmuqiao Township in the Sixth District of this county, stated that their township suffered a flood disaster last year, with houses washed away and fields becoming a sea of water, resulting in no grain harvest. The county government had already verified this and approved landlords to be exempt from national taxes and tenants to be exempt from land rent. Now, with a bountiful autumn harvest this year, farmers and tenants followed the usual practice of paying rent to the granary. However, the granary authorities are forcing them to compensate for the arrears rent from last year, disregarding the certified disaster relief tickets. They have specially petitioned the county government to order the granaries to exempt them from last year's arrears rent based on the disaster relief tickets, in order to relieve the people's distress.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Scion Violently Beats Boatmen</h3>
<p>In the river outside the Xin San Fuhexiang Rice Shop outside the North Gate, a covered boat arrived and docked the day before yesterday evening. Unexpectedly, Xu Jinshou and Xu Shuncai, the sons of the rice shop owner, suddenly ordered the boat to leave and forbade it from docking. However, the boatmen, including Gu Xiaowang, had already taken off their clothes and gone to sleep. Seeing that no one came out, Xu became furious and immediately ordered several shop assistants to push the boat away, leading to a dispute with the boatman Gu Xiaowang. They then resorted to violence, giving Xiaowang a severe beating, causing him to collapse on the ground with injuries all over his body. Seeing that they had caused trouble, Xu Jinshou and others scattered. The police officer on duty arrived and arrested two accomplices, Gu Aju and Qian Ajin, and took them to the Fifth Sub-Bureau, while sending the injured person to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries are severe and there is concern for his life.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Two Robbers Captured in Yangshuyuan Robbery Case</p>
<p>On the afternoon of January 30th of this year, more than thirty bandits suddenly raided the town of Yangshuyuan in the Fourteenth District of this county, robbing a total of eleven businesses and kidnapping nine people, including Lu Liansheng and Yang Shaoqing. At the same time, the town's stationed water patrol boat, being outnumbered, was also robbed of six rifles and two thousand rounds of ammunition. Officer Li Shihua was wounded by a bullet, and cook Li Shunsheng died from severe injuries. After the incident, the authorities paid extraordinary attention, and the Civil Affairs Department repeatedly ordered the county to cooperate in apprehending the escaped robbers. Subsequently, the Thirteenth Water Police Team successively rescued six kidnapped individuals, including Shen Shuzhou and Weng Zanyang. However, Gu Huiliang, Jing Hongxiang, Jing Hengbao and three others have been missing for nearly a year without any news. Unexpectedly, the other day Jing Ruqiu (the son of the kidnapped Jing Hongxiang) saw two unknown people from other places in a teahouse owned by a person surnamed Shao, who looked very much like the bandits who threatened them with guns at the time. He went to report to his uncle, Jing Yunxiang. After confirming, they secretly reported to the local public security post, which dispatched police to search the teahouse owned by Shao. They captured the two individuals. Shao Yicai, the owner of the teahouse, was also detained on suspicion of harboring bandits. On the 18th, they were escorted to the Public Security Bureau in the city, where the Chief of the Judicial Section conducted a preliminary interrogation. One of them, Tang Guangbin, confessed to running a teahouse in Yu Jing Tang, Wu County. He came to the town to attend the wedding of Lu Guanyun and stayed temporarily at the Shao's teahouse because he couldn't return home. The other, Lu Guanyun, confessed that he was a farmer in Yu Jing Tang and came with Tang to stay temporarily at the Shao's teahouse because he was engaged to a Zhang woman from Yangshuyuan. They claimed to know nothing about the robbery case this spring. The Public Security Bureau, considering the seriousness of the case, transferred them to the county government on the 19th for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Extension of Deadline for Registration of Salt Fields in Tongtai</p>
<p>Wang Zhangyou, the Salt Transport Deputy of Huainan, requested an extension for the registration of salt fields for merchants in Tongtai because the deadline had passed, coinciding with the merger of field affairs and rush handover, making it impossible to complete the registration on time. The Ministry of Finance has now approved the request and ordered the field merchants to register on time.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Five Communists Arrested and Sent to the Province</p>
<p>Shu Xian and other farmers from Lucheng were reported by someone to the provincial party headquarters for suspected communist activities. The provincial special commissioner went to Danyang to consult with the county government and secretly instructed the Public Security Bureau to send police to arrest the suspects Shu Xian, Zhang Fukan, Zhang Bao San, Xue Bin, and Yun Yipeng by name. Yesterday, County Magistrate Wang, together with the Standing Committee of the County Party Headquarters, Fu Tang, secretly interrogated the five suspects once. It is reported that there was a strong suspicion of their involvement. They have now been prepared documents to be sent to the provincial party headquarters for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Injury in Xinzhuang Township</h3>
<p>The home of Wang Lu, a farmer in Xijiangtou Village, Xinzhuang Township in the Seventh District, was suddenly raided by more than twenty bandits carrying firearms the night before last. They broke into the house and looted wantonly. The owner was unable to escape and was held by the bandits and severely burned. He has now reported the case and requested an arrest.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Unidentified Male Corpse Found Outside the North Gate</p>
<p>Yesterday, an unidentified male corpse was found in front of the Lvzu Temple south of the General's Temple outside the North Gate. He was wearing a black cotton-padded jacket, blue cloth cotton trousers, and a white broadcloth gown, and appeared to be about thirty years old. The Fourth Sub-Station reported this to the county government, which dispatched personnel to investigate.</p>
<h3>Narcotics Investigation Office Begins Operations</h3>
<p>The Narcotics Investigation Office established by the Jiangsu Provincial Government has appointed someone named Jiang as the Director of the local Investigation Office and Gao Fu as the Deputy Director. They have started operations immediately and have established investigation stations at key points on land and water to conduct thorough investigations.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Pastry Shops Oppose Business Tax and Go on Strike</p>
<p>There are no less than two hundred and forty to fifty pastry shops inside and outside the city. The Huaiyin Business Tax Collection Bureau has set a deadline for submitting declaration forms to prepare for the collection of business tax from each shop, causing panic among the shop owners. Most of them rely on their small businesses and handicrafts to make a living, and few have capital of around one hundred yuan. If they are also taxed, it will be impossible to bear. Ignoring the tax would lead to fines, so on the morning of the 14th, all the shops went on strike. More than two hundred shop owners gathered at the collection bureau to demand a reduction or exemption, arguing all day without any results. This morning (the 15th), the strike continued. Members of the "Ma" gang workers monitored the "Tu" gang to prevent them from secretly selling food. The "Tu" gang workers, in turn, monitored the pastry shops in Huai'an to prevent them from secretly bringing food. Wu Jiatian of the "Tu" gang secretly sold steamed buns this morning, which was discovered by the "Ma" gang. This led to a large public debt, and the crowd destroyed Wu's shop. Later, the county government and the Public Security Bureau, fearing an accident, sent police to maintain order. Liu Dingxin and others, members of the Standing Committee of the County Chamber of Commerce, came forward to mediate, promising to find a solution for the pastry shops. The shop owners and workers then dispersed and returned to their shops.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Yuzhang Torpedo Boat is Difficult to Salvage</p>
<p>The Yuzhang torpedo boat, sunk outside the Lujing Port in Nantong, has been submerged for almost a year. The Navy Department previously hired workers to salvage it, but after more than a month, it was not successful. Because the boat is now trapped in the sand, the labor costs have become too high, making it difficult to proceed.</p>
<h3>Data Inland River Steamer Suspends Operations</h3>
<p>The Data Inland River Steamer, running various routes, was restarted this spring with an investment of 40,000 yuan from the Maintenance Committee. Due to poor business and the riverbed drying up, it has suffered significant losses. It is reported that the Maintenance Committee has given up hope for the future and is implementing a shutdown.</p>
<h3>Taixian</h3>
<p>Provincial Order to Reduce Deed Tax by Half</p>
<p>The county government recently received an order from the Provincial Finance Department, stating that the amount of taxes collected by various counties was too large, causing people to hide their contracts and not pay taxes. In order to promote tax revenue and reduce the burden on the people, it is approved to reduce the original tax rate by half for one month starting from December 20th. During this one month, the original surcharges and intermediary donations will also be reduced by half. The original overdue penalties will be waived. The county government is now issuing a notice to the public and instructing its subordinates to comply and promote it.</p>

<h3>Cheng Qian and Others Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Southern China's Relief Efforts for Northeastern Refugees are Very Enthusiastic</p>
<p>Members of the Central Executive Committee, Bai Wenwei, Cheng Qian, Liu Luyin, Zhang Zhiben, and others, went to Guangdong to solicit opinions from the members of the Central Executive Committee in Guangdong on the proposals of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and to raise donations for the relief of refugees in Northeast China. Bai and Zhang had already returned to Shanghai earlier. Liu is currently still in Guangdong, while Cheng returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, along with members of the Central Executive Committee, Gui Chongji, Huang Fusheng, and Sun Jingya, on the Changxing Company's Japanese Empress liner. The liner was originally scheduled to arrive at 9:00 AM yesterday, but was delayed due to fog along the way. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired about his trip south during the voyage. According to Cheng, the process of soliciting opinions from the members of the Central Executive Committee in Guangdong on the proposals of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee had already been published in the newspapers by Bai and Zhang, and there was no need to repeat it. As for the matter of negotiating relief for the Northeastern refugees in Guangdong, the results were very good. He personally went to the Macau area to discuss relief measures with local people, who enthusiastically expressed their support. Therefore, a charter has been drafted to proceed, and offices for the relief of Northeastern refugees will be established in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macau to carry out the work. Local chambers of commerce are also happy to be responsible for providing assistance. Various sectors in Macau pledged to donate 80,000 to 90,000 yuan per month, and Guangzhou was even more enthusiastic, reaching over 9 million yuan per month. Hong Kong is still in progress, and the results are expected to be considerable. During this trip south, he repeatedly met with Hu Zhantang and Chen Jitang. Mr. Zhantang's illness has recovered, and all sectors in Guangdong Province are able to earnestly handle anti-Japanese work, so the results are remarkable. As for the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the people of Guangdong are very pleased. Cheng also said that the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee has already convened, and he does not intend to go to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Representatives Head North to Comfort the Righteous Army</h3>
<p>Carrying</p>
<p>Over 40,000 Yuan in Cash and Over 2,000 Bottles of Yunnan Baiyao</p>
<p>Dou Shaohuai and Qian Zizhuang, representatives of the Kunming City Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in Yunnan, departed from Hankou on November 16th to go north and comfort the Northeastern Volunteer Army. They arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met them at a friend's place yesterday. According to Dou, the people of Yunnan are making extraordinary efforts for the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. The Association is led by the chambers of commerce of various counties and cities, together with local groups, to organize anti-Japanese national salvation associations in each county and city. These associations are then combined into the Association at the Yunnan Provincial Chamber of Commerce. The representatives departed from the provincial capital on November 16th, and passed through Haiphong, Hong Kong, and other places, where they were welcomed by the local Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. They also discussed the progress of anti-Japanese national salvation. After passing through Guangzhou, they benefited greatly from contacting the Guangdong National Salvation Association. The representatives have been informing the Association of the situation in various places to learn from their experiences.</p>
<p>They arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and visited the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. They also met with Yang You, the Director of General Affairs of the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association, who clarified many things for the representatives regarding their journey north. The main task of the representatives is to comfort the hardworking and meritorious Northeastern Volunteer Army, and to connect with local people's anti-Japanese organizations to exchange feelings and information, so as to pool efforts and work together. The items carried by the representatives for comfort are only over 40,000 yuan in cash, as a small token of their regard, and over 2,000 bottles of Yunnan Baiyao, as a resource for temporary first aid. The money has been remitted to a suitable location in the Northeast, waiting for the representatives to arrive and withdraw it for comfort. The medicines have been transported from Hankou to Shanghai and will be shipped from Shanghai as soon as they arrive. They plan to go to Rehe first, and then proceed forward depending on the situation. After entering the customs, they will go to Beiping and Tianjin to discuss everything, and then return via the two places. The following is a letter from the Association to the Shanghai Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association: Sincerely, since the Northeastern region has been occupied by the violent Japanese invaders for more than a year, the suffering of our compatriots has intensified, and the survival of the nation is in danger. Looking back at the past, the whole country is filled with grief and indignation. Fortunately, the generals and soldiers of the Northeastern Volunteer Army have resisted with all their might and fought bloody battles for years. The Japanese invaders are exhausted and unable to cope. If we persist in resisting, the lost territories of the three provinces will be recovered sooner or later. However, the generals are fighting for the survival of the people and for the independence of the country, their hard work is meritorious and their names are illustrious, and the whole country admires them and provides support. Our province is far away in the southwest, and the patriotic enthusiasm of the people has not lagged behind. However, due to the poverty of the region, we have been unable to fully support the righteous army, which is regrettable. In addition to collecting a small amount of funds and medicines, which will be remitted separately, we have specially recommended Dou Shaohuai to represent our association and personally go to the war zone outside the customs to comfort them and express our condolences. We should therefore write to your association for verification and request that you contact Dou when he arrives in Shanghai and give him instructions on everything, and that you send a telegram in advance to the generals and soldiers of the Northeastern Volunteer Army for verification. This is our sincere hope.</p>

<p>Generals Li Du and Ding Chao have made great achievements in resisting Japan in Taiwan. He specifically telegraphed Wang Ziyao, his representative stationed in Shanghai, instructing him to personally request assistance from Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang to quell the invasion of the Japanese. He expressed his joy at the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. It is reported that Wang will go to Beijing this time to request substantial assistance from the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and will personally meet with Chiang Kai-shek to beg for assistance. The original telegram is as follows: The restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia has greatly changed the diplomatic situation. Hearing this, we are overjoyed. Regarding our needs, we hope that you will again personally implore the Chief (Chiang Kai-shek) and the Deputy Chief (Zhang Xueliang) to provide full assistance in order to inspire our morale and enable us to quell the invasion of the Japanese as soon as possible. We are looking forward to it with utmost anticipation. Li Du, Ding Chao, Xiao.</p>
<p>Yan Bowen's Letter</p>
<p>Yan Bowen, the military commissioner of the Rehe National Anti-Japanese Army and the representative stationed in Shanghai, sent a letter to various support groups yesterday, saying: Sincerely, our army has been resisting Japan for years. The battles, such as breaking Chaoyang, capturing Yixian, seizing Zhangwu, recovering Kangping, occupying Ban Jita, capturing Mengjiatun, attacking Beizhen, and fighting in Jinzhou, etc., have been described in detail in the newspapers and need not be repeated. The capture of Ishimoto and the documents obtained from Honjo detailing the collusion with Chinese traitors to plunder Rehe have allowed Rehe to be preserved to this day. The facts of these military achievements cannot be borrowed by other righteous armies. Furthermore, fighting barefoot in the icy and snowy weather, charging into battle, and rushing through gunfire with unwavering courage are not things that a motley crowd can do. Recently, with the retreat of Su (Bingwen) and Ma (Zhanshan) abroad and the failure and mutilation of the righteous armies (such as Tang Juwu, etc.), the relentless Japanese invaders have concentrated their wolfish forces and are urgently pressing towards Rehe. The mission and responsibility borne by our army are related to the survival of Rehe, the survival of North China, and the survival of the entire China, which is even heavier and greater than before. In general, Su and Ma have become the center of the anti-Japanese movement of the righteous armies outside the customs. If Su and Ma survive, the righteous armies outside the customs can still jointly contain the Japanese invaders and prevent them from driving straight in. If Su and Ma are defeated, the center of the righteous armies outside the customs will be lost, and even if they want to jointly contain the Japanese invaders, it will be impossible. Thus, the Japanese invaders can concentrate on Rehe. Thus, Rehe is in urgent danger. Thus, our army's responsibility and mission to coexist with Rehe is as critical as a hair's breadth. If our army wins, Rehe will not be lost, and the recovery of the territories outside the customs can be slowly achieved. If we lose, the recovery of the territories outside the customs will be even more difficult, and Rehe will also be difficult to protect. If Rehe is not protected, Hebei will be difficult to defend. If Hebei is not defended, the entire North China will inevitably be shaken. Then, Puyi will usurp Beiping, restore the Manchu dynasty, to deal with the powers. The Japanese invaders will then use the navy to press forward, re-enacting the January 28th Incident in the provinces along the Yangtze River, and coerce our government. At that time, our government will be controlled by the Japanese invaders in the south and Puyi in the north. If we want to fight to the death and seek a final victory to avoid the pain of national subjugation, how can it be possible? The importance of our army's responsibility and mission is as described above, so we hope that our army can fight a long-term war and defeat the Japanese invaders. To enable our army to fight a long-term war and have the hope of defeating the Japanese invaders depends on the continuous support of our compatriots in the rear. The replenishment of ammunition, the transportation of cotton clothing, and the preparation of supplies must all be planned by our compatriots in the rear. The mission and responsibility of our compatriots in the rear is more important than that of the soldiers at the front. I think your association is the most powerful group of our compatriots in the rear supporting our righteous army, and all of you are virtuous and courageous heroes who are most enthusiastic about supporting our righteous army. You should be able to deeply understand the responsibility and mission of supporting the rear, and you should be able to sympathize with the difficulties and dangers faced by the soldiers at the front. Therefore, I take the liberty to state the facts directly, hoping that your association will treat all righteous armies equally in terms of support, so that the soldiers at the front can move forward bravely without any worries. Then, when the lost territories are recovered and we celebrate our triumphant return, we will be grateful for your support and acknowledge the merits of your association. Is this not appropriate? As I write, my thoughts are flying, and I cannot express all that I want to say. I specifically write this letter to convey my urgent need for support.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee Member Wang Yansong of the Chamber of Commerce Talks About the Continued Efforts to Boycott Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Practical Work, No Need for Publicity</p>
<p>Wang Yansong, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday that citizens have the freedom to purchase goods, and merchants' transportation of goods is purely based on their own choices. Recently, various industries in the city have organizations that support the International League Covenant Committee, and they have all filled out voluntary pledges and will no longer sell or transport inferior goods. The Chamber of Commerce is organized by various industry associations and naturally takes the will of each industry as its will, leading the city's merchants and people to strive for economic boycott. For a year, this ambition has not changed. In the future, we will continue to do this sincerely and practically. As for our association and myself, we received a letter yesterday from someone named the "Defend the Nation Society" offering suggestions. In fact, rescuing from the boycott of Japanese goods lies in practical work. There is no need for empty words of publicity, which are counterproductive. If patriotic people from all walks of life have any suggestions to publish, they can visit the association in person at any time to meet and talk, and I am willing to accept and consider them. As for anonymous letters, there is no need to clarify them.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Association Opposes the Five-Nation Small Committee Draft</h3>
<p>The National Salvation Association of various groups in this city held its 37th committee meeting at its headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from various groups, including Liao Mingyuan, Chen Peide, Liu Chuan, Wu Zhongdao, Shen Zuju, Zhang Tianbai, Zhu Youwei, Song An, Guo Xiuyan, Chen Guochao, Zhao Bingran, Liao Zhaoyun, and over twenty others, attended. Shen Zuju, the chairman of the Publicity Department of the Association, reported on the work and current affairs. Afterwards, they discussed opposing the draft resolution of the Five-Nation Small Committee, which was unanimously passed and a declaration was issued. The declaration stated, in brief, that the Sino-Japanese dispute over the past year has led the powerful League of Nations to lose its position of justice and destroy its organizational life, which is regrettable. The draft resolution drafted by the nineteen-nation committee and the five-nation small group meeting completely abandons the root cause of the problem and caters to the violent Japan. The association originally had no hope for this meeting, but considering the status of the five nations, there should at least be a resolution on the following minimum matters: (1) It is proposed that the League of Nations should adopt stern measures to order Japan to quickly withdraw all its military forces in Manchuria in order to maintain peace in the Far East and protect the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. (2) It should be formally announced that the puppet state of Manchuria will not be recognized, and Japan, which created the illegal puppet state of Manchuria by violence, must be severely sanctioned. (3) Japan should be held fully responsible for all the losses suffered by China from the Japanese violent invasion since the September 18th Incident in 1931. (4) It should be proposed to use the pressure of various countries to sanction Japan's illegal acts of destroying peace and invading Chinese territory as a slight punishment. However, the five-nation resolution draft does not mention this point, abandoning its life of fairness. The association is deeply saddened by this and dares to seriously declare to the outside world that the Chinese people will never agree to any resolution that does not adopt the above minimum matters and will resolutely oppose it. We also hope that our people will use their own strength to actively carry out fundamental and effective efforts.</p>
<h3>Tang Juwu's Telegram Declares</h3>
<p>Only Received 6,000 Yuan in Donations from the Overseas Chinese Economic Committee</p>
<p>A telegram from Beiping to the Shenbao Newspaper and forwarded to various newspapers and groups states: Before Shanghai newspapers reported that the Overseas Chinese Economic Relief Committee donated 10,050 yuan to our department, our department actually received 6,000 yuan of ocean dollars from Mr. He Yongzhen transferred from the Overseas Chinese Relief Committee. We have already telegraphed Chairman Li Denghui to publish this. For your public review, Tang Juwu, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army of the Righteous Army.</p>
<h3>National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Telegram Requests Reduction and Exemption of Harsh Taxes in Chahar Province</h3>
<p>Amidst the Restoration of Sino-Russian Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>Promoting Trade with Russia</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry telegraphed the National Government Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: We recently received a letter from the Zhangjiakou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that Zhangjiakou is the barrier of North China and a commercial area outside the Great Wall. Commerce is prosperous and returning goods are famous. Businessmen of all kinds live prosperous lives. Tracing back to the prosperity of the local business community, trade with Mongolia has always been the only source. Later, due to the independence of Outer Mongolia, Zhangku's business has been greatly affected. Due to the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Zhangku's trade has been completely cut off. In recent years, the losses of Chinese businessmen's lives and properties in Kulun have been uncountable. The bankruptcies and unemployment of local businessmen from all walks of life are no less than tens of millions. This kind of difficulty is universally known throughout the country, and it is not easy to reverse the situation regarding national diplomacy. Fortunately, in the commercial area of many years, although Outer Mongolia has severed trade, Inner Mongolia and the local area can still operate as usual, and the livelihoods of merchants from various industries can still be barely maintained. However, in recent years, the harshness of national and local taxes and the variety of names have made it impossible for businessmen from all walks of life to bear them, and they have been unable to cope with them. Previously, the various counties jointly launched a movement to eliminate harsh taxes and levies and made requests to all parties, but they have not received any consideration. Appeals for assistance have now been made, but there is no way to appeal. Now, the chambers of commerce of all counties in the province have jointly elected representatives to rush to Nanjing to appeal for relief. Our association has elected two representatives, Cheng Tingmo and Guo Kuizhang, to accompany the representatives from various counties to Beijing to carry out the petition. The representatives are new to Beijing and Shanghai and are unfamiliar with the area, and there are many barriers to all matters. Because merchants are one body and have a common destiny, we believe that the implementation of the request to eliminate harsh taxes and levies and restore Zhangku's trade will be sympathized with and assisted by all of you in your association. In addition to the representatives meeting with high officials to present everything in person, we should write to your association to ask for your love and care, to give you contact and to maintain guidance, and so on. Upon approval, we will investigate that Zhangjiakou is an important route for trade between our country and Outer Mongolia and Russia. The city is prosperous. Since Outer Mongolia became independent and China and Russia severed diplomatic relations, business has been interrupted and the city has declined. In addition to the exploitation of harsh taxes and levies, the number of bankrupt and unemployed merchants is countless. Now that China and Russia have restored diplomatic relations, trade will also develop, and Zhangjiakou's recovery is in sight. However, harsh taxes and levies are a real obstacle to progress. The chamber of commerce and others have experienced the situation firsthand and are in great pain. Now, the province has publicly elected representatives to go to Beijing to petition, and they should send a telegram to the Yuan and Ministry to inspect and verify. Please approve the request and quickly order the Chahar Provincial Government to issue a notice to the entire province to eliminate harsh taxes and levies in order to maintain business difficulties. This is an urgent request. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry.</p>
<h3>He Bingxian Discusses Sino-Russian Trade Situation</h3>
<p>After Resumption of Diplomatic Relations, Commerce Between the Two Countries Should Advance. Cheaper Russian Goods Will Be Beneficial to Our Country. Chinese People Should Adopt a Policy of Promoting National Products.</p>
<p>Following the declaration of resumed diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, the people of both countries have celebrated in unison. This event will not only strengthen the friendship between the two nations but also greatly enhance the economic ties between them. He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, gave a detailed account of the Sino-Soviet trade situation yesterday, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's Foreign Trade System</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's foreign trade is entirely the exclusive right of the government, which is also a part of the entire system of the Soviet Russia's New Economic Policy. It was legally stipulated on April 22, 1918. The competent authority for this privilege is the People's Committee for Foreign Trade. The actual operators are the national import and export trading companies specially established by the government and the trading companies affiliated to state-owned industrial organizations, as well as other franchised trading companies. People's organizations may not engage in foreign trade without special permission. The main objectives of state-owned enterprises are, firstly, to address the backwardness of Soviet Russia's mechanical industry, which necessitates the absorption of essential industrial construction supplies through state-owned methods; and secondly, to rectify the significant disruptions in the Soviet Russian national economy's distribution, which requires the redistribution of national gains. Therefore, both imports and exports are subject to planned restrictions and systematic planning. On the one hand, this is influenced by the needs of various industries for raw materials, machinery, and equipment; on the other hand, it is guided by the surplus of goods, credit, and the potential for various intangible incomes to offset the deficit of necessary imports. In other words, the state rationalizes foreign trade based on established plans, the degree of need, and the surplus of commodity production.</p>
<p>Current Status of Soviet Russia's Foreign Trade</p>
<p>In 1913, Soviet Russia was still in the era of Imperial Russia, with an annual production value of 20,040 million rubles. After the revolution, it increased year by year, reaching 29.1 billion rubles in 1930 (calculated at pre-war rates), which should be 145.2, an increase of 45%. However, its exports have decreased significantly compared to 1913. The ratio of exports to production in 1913 was 7.6%, while currently it is only 2.9%. This shows the increase in production and the restrictions on exports. Moreover, almost all exports are limited to timber, kerosene, fur, flax, ramie, and grains, accounting for three-fifths of total exports. The main reason is that Soviet Russia has undergone fundamental changes since the revolution. Exporting is not aimed at seeking profitable markets abroad with domestic surplus products but purely at offsetting the deficit of necessary imports. Therefore, the quantity of exports depends on the necessary imports. Before the war, Imperial Russia was an important country for agricultural products in the world (agricultural products accounted for 70% of exports before the war). Now, it is trending towards industrial exports, accounting for 60%.</p>
<p>Trade Situation Between China and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>There have been significant changes in trade between China and the Soviet Union before and after the revolution. It should be noted that China's trade with the Soviet Union is passive, while the Soviet Russia's trade with China is active and entirely controlled by the Soviet Russia's state-owned policy. Before the European War, exports to Russia were worth about 48 million customs taels. Recently, they have increased to 89 million (1928), and in 1930, about 50 million. However, the types of goods have changed. Imports from Russia were previously worth about 20 million customs taels, and they have remained at about this level in recent years. After the resumption of diplomatic relations, trade between the two sides will naturally have significant progress. At the same time, Chinese people are also ordering Russian goods to compensate for the lack of domestic products. Although transportation is affected by the rebellious situation in the Northeast, transportation in Xinjiang, Mongolia, and the Northwest is also convenient. The development of trade can be expected. However, Soviet Russia's foreign trade already has a set policy. Imports are absolutely limited to necessities, and exports are based on the standard of not hindering the national economy. This is not comparable to other countries with freely operated commerce. Therefore, after the resumption of diplomatic relations, the development of trade between the two countries may tend to focus on imports. A large amount of goods such as kerosene, timber, and other commodities that Soviet Russia can sell abroad will be imported, which will benefit our country due to their low prices. However, it is unlikely that exports to Russia will have special and significant achievements. The major export products to Russia were originally beans and tea, but the future of beans this year is unknown due to the rebellious situation. Other products are mostly not necessary for Russia. This can be inferred from the statistics of growth and decline over the years. At this time, if the Chinese people do not pay close attention to the promotion of domestic products, the result may change the surplus of exports over the years into a deficit of imports from Russia. The development of trade may not be as enthusiastically expected by the Chinese people now. In short, the Chinese people should adopt the promotion of national products and the development of industry as a permanent and fundamental policy to seek new outlets in foreign markets, so that we may succeed.</p>
<h3>Russian Commercial Representatives Begin Activities</h3>
<p>Contacting Our Business Community to Promote Sales</p>
<p>Nanjing dispatch: According to business circles, after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the Russian commercial representatives stationed in Nanjing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou will openly engage in activities and contact our business community to promote sales. It is expected that after the appointment of ambassadors from both countries, the Russian side will first restore the shipping route between Vladivostok and Shanghai, specializing in the transportation of goods. They will also organize large freight stations and large trading firms in Tianjin and Shanghai. The Russian goods sold in China will mainly include wool textiles, kerosene, hardware materials, woolen cloth, paper, and other miscellaneous goods.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog Obstructs Navigation Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Gradually Dispersing in the Afternoon, Waterways Gradually Resume</p>
<p>Heavy fog occurred in the local area the night before last. Yesterday morning, maritime traffic was almost completely obstructed. It was not until noon in the afternoon that the weather changed and the fog dissipated. Some of the obstructed ships were able to enter the port. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The local area was heavily foggy. Around one o'clock in the morning, it was almost impossible to see objects across the street. There were also dense clouds in the Yangtze River basin, and the air pressure was very low. Commercial ships coming to Shanghai from various places were unable to enter the port due to the fog. A total of sea vessels, including Fusheng, Dingsheng, Shengjing, Mankoku, Mikasayama Maru, Katori Maru, Shibade, Fengtian Maru, Yiwenhua, Nafok Maru, and Tai Ma, as well as river vessels such as Tonghe and Wenzhou, temporarily anchored in the waters of Wusongkou to avoid danger. Even European and American mail ships that are never delayed, such as Empress of Russia, Ligee, and President Monroe, failed to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning. They all telegraphed to extend the import time. From 5:00 AM to 12:00 PM, only three ships, including Jianghe and Xinning Shao, were able to pass.</p>
<h3>Afternoon</h3>
<p>The weather changed, and a slight northwest wind rose in the outer sea of Wusong. The heavy fog gradually dissipated. Among the ships that had been obstructed, those that had reached Sanjiashui, such as Dingsheng, Taiyuan, Xinming, Fengtian Maru, Tianjin Maru, and British and American mail ships, rushed to Shanghai. After 3:00 PM, Lu Lai sailed into the Huangpu River, but the ship schedule had already been missed. The rest of the ships that did not make it in time will enter the port today. The regular scheduled ships that were delayed were all working overtime last night to load cargo to reduce the time spent in Shanghai so that they could depart as usual today. As for the Shanghai-Ningbo liners, Xin Beijing and Xinning Shao, each ship still sailed out last night, and all the Zhejiang Bay ships also departed.</p>
<h3>First Snowfall in the Local Area Yesterday</h3>
<p>The weather in the local area has been unusually warm for the past few days, with the Fahrenheit temperature rising to around 70 degrees. Yesterday, suddenly dark clouds covered the sky, and it was unusually gloomy. At about 3:10 PM, snowflakes suddenly began to flutter, with drizzling rain. In an instant, it arrived, and the weather has turned slightly cold. It is feared that there will be heavy snowfall.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Opposes Stamp Duty on Ship Tickets</h3>
<p>Painfully States That It Has No Legal Basis and Requests That It Not Be Misinterpreted and Applied by Analogy</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Communications yesterday, requesting the exemption of stamp duty on ship tickets. The original text reads: Nanjing Executive Yuan, Ministries of Finance and Communications: On the 17th of this month, the Inland River Shipping Industry Association sent a public letter stating that the Jiangsu Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau issued a notice last month, ordering that from December 1st, all ship passenger tickets worth one yuan or more must have stamps affixed, and dispatched bureau staff to intimidate and force the affixing of stamps, causing the industry's members to be uneasy and requesting an emergency meeting to quickly seek relief. The association held a meeting in winter and unanimously agreed that the stamp duty on ship tickets has no legal basis and is impossible to accept. It was decided to telegraph the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Communications to promptly issue an order to abolish it. It is noted that stamp duty is a good law implemented in various countries around the world, but ship tickets have never had stamps affixed to them. Even a search of various countries in the East and West reveals no such precedent. Furthermore, the Provisional Measures for Stamp Duty Regulations do not include ship tickets. Therefore, the stamp duty on ship tickets has no legal basis. Secondly, the state must have the Legislature approve and the Executive Yuan promulgate each type of tax law before it can be implemented according to law, but the stamp duty on ship tickets has not gone through the above legal procedures. Therefore, the stamp duty on ship tickets has no legal basis. Thirdly, ship tickets are a transformation of the bamboo slips of the past and are temporary symbols, not comparable to other permanent documents. Therefore, the stamp duty on ship tickets has no legal basis. Fourthly, since ship tickets are temporary symbols used by the transportation industry, with the same nature as train tickets and bus tickets, even if stamp duty is implemented, the ruling party cannot be biased. Therefore, the stamp duty on ship tickets is also not in line with the situation. To sum up, there is no possibility of implementing stamp duty on ship tickets. If implemented, it will not only increase the burden on the people but also violate the Provisional Constitution. Therefore, the details are specifically stated, and it is requested that your office promptly forward them to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Communications, and Ministry of Finance to issue an order to abolish the imposition of stamp duty. After investigation by the association, it was found that ship passenger tickets, the use of stamps, according to the Stamp Tax Law Interim Regulations Article 2 one to four categories, none of this provision, the Tax Gazette quoted the instructions issued by Your Ministry on September 8th to the Shandong Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau in the document, the stamp duty law is now being drafted and revised in preparation, should be in accordance with the interim regulations prior to promulgation, do not cite analogies, causing criticism and the letter of August 10th to the Executive Yuan Secretariat, also ordered all provinces of the Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau strictly order all subordinates, before the promulgation of the Stamp Tax Law, still in accordance with the regulations established case handling, shall not distort and seek, slightly involved in harsh treatment, because ship tickets posted are not expressly provided for, not a reference is distortion, kernel and the above department orders do not conform, should be telegraphed to your office for inspection, prompt correction, it is for the public convenience, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce bow down to you,</p>
<h3>Three-Party Negotiations on the Fuhai Frigate Case</h3>
<p>Three-Party Negotiations</p>
<p>Regarding the misunderstanding and gunfire incident between the Fuhai patrol frigate of the Jiangzhe Fisheries Administration and the Jiangnan Shipyard, the shipyard side yesterday telegraphed Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan and sent a letter to the Fisheries Administration for serious negotiations. At the same time, the Fisheries Administration also received a formal report from Guo Wei, the captain of the Fuhai frigate, and reported the situation to Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, requesting instructions on how to deal with the matter. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Letter to Fisheries Administration for Negotiations</p>
<p>After the negotiators dispatched by the shipyard were blocked and returned to the shipyard, the shipyard, for the sake of peaceful resolution, sent a letter to the Fisheries Administration for serious negotiations. The original letter stated: I am writing to inform you that the Fuhai of your administration was repaired at our shipyard last year, totaling more than 20,000 taels of silver in repair costs. After repeated requests for payment, the shipyard initially made excuses and then ignored the requests. Yesterday, it was reported that the ship was docked in the Huangpu River, so the shipyard immediately sent personnel on large and small ships to inquire and facilitate negotiations. Unexpectedly, the personnel on the ship opened fire to prevent boarding and negotiations. What is the reason for this? It is difficult to understand. I hope you will investigate and reply promptly for proper handling. This is addressed to the Jiangzhe Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Industry, Jiangnan Shipyard.</p>
<h3>Fuhai Reports the Situation</h3>
<p>In addition to receiving a letter from the shipyard, the Fisheries Administration also received a formal report from Guo Wei, the captain of the Fuhai patrol frigate. The report stated: Your subordinate frigate was ordered to set sail to patrol and protect fishing in the Dinghai area. Subsequently, this month, repeated telegrams were received, ordering the frigate to sail to Shanghai to await dispatch. Therefore, on the 14th of this month, the frigate sailed from Shenjiamen to Shanghai and arrived at Tongjiang Bay on the evening of the 15th, docking at Guanhuaigiao to await orders, all of which have been reported. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM on the 17th, two armed ships of the Jiangnan Shipyard, Jiangnan Jiangkang, suddenly sailed towards your subordinate frigate. The officers and soldiers of the ships were exposed and prepared to attack. Only when they were one zhang away from your subordinate frigate did they realize that the target of their attack was your subordinate frigate. At that time, the situation was extremely tense. Later, the personnel on the two armed ships remotely shouted, ordering your subordinate frigate to lower its flag and remove its weapons. Judging from their appearance, it seemed that they were planning to plunder the frigate. At that time, your subordinate was not aware of the truth and, moreover, was in the Shanghai area, where military police were everywhere. Therefore, your subordinate only ordered the officers, crew, and sailors to be on strict alert to avoid accidents. Seeing the alert, the two ships circled for about 30 minutes before automatically sailing downstream of the Huangpu River. Your subordinate frigate belongs to the administration of your office and is also part of the government's armed forces. Today, it has unexpectedly been attacked, which is deeply shocking. If it were not for proper precautions, it would have been difficult to avoid being robbed. Therefore, the details of the situation are reported in detail. Guo Wei, Captain of the Fuhai Patrol Frigate.</p>
<h3>Report to the Ministry Requesting Instructions</h3>
<p>After receiving the official letter from the shipyard and the report from Guo Wei, the captain of the Fuhai frigate, the Acting Director of the Fisheries Administration, Zhou Chengkui, believed that the matter was of great importance and should not be decided arbitrarily. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, he telegraphed Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, stating: Recently, your subordinate Guo Wei, the captain of the Fuhai patrol frigate, reported that (omitted details) and other details. While processing the case, the Jiangnan Shipyard also claimed that (omitted details) in order to handle the matter. After reviewing the details, the Jiangnan Shipyard did not first return to the competent authorities for handling but instead took direct action. It is clearly erroneous to ask an officer not in charge to order the frigate to lower its flag and remove its weapons. In addition to ordering the Fuhai frigate to await instructions from the Ministry, the circumstances were reported by telegram for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Shipyard Telegram to the Ministry</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipyard sent two telegrams to the Ministry of Industry yesterday. (Telegram 1) Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing: The Fuhai patrol frigate of the Jiangzhe Fisheries Administration of your ministry was repaired at our shipyard last year and completed in November. The repair cost was a total of 20,291 taels of silver, which has not yet been paid. Our shipyard has repeatedly sent letters urging payment, but they have been excused as not being approved by the ministry. Now our shipyard urgently needs this payment to pay the workers' wages. I sincerely request that your ministry order the Fisheries Administration to promptly return the repair cost in full. Thank you very much. Jiangnan Shipyard. (Telegram 2) Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing: Telegram has been received. The shipyard previously undertook the repair of the Fuhai patrol frigate of the Jiangzhe Fisheries Administration of your ministry, which has now been ten months, but the repair cost has not yet been paid. Please order the Fisheries Administration to promptly return the money to be used for reimbursement and request instructions. Jiangnan Shipyard.</p>
<p>Grain and Silver Transported to Northeast China</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Wheat Flour Purchased in Northeast China</h3>
<p>After the Japanese army occupied Northeast China, our ports have blockaded Northeast China's seaports, and the customs have ordered a ban on food grains being carried to Northeast China's seaports, but recently, Northeast China is still procuring large quantities of wheat flour in Shanghai and transporting it to Shenyang and other places. All purchases are shipped to Dalian, and more than 300,000 bags have been purchased and transported. The flour has been shipped one after another, and the last batch was exported today.</p>
<h3>Eighth Major Shipment of Funds Sent Out</h3>
<p>Since November 6th, Shanghai has begun transporting silver dollars to Shenyang. In these 40 days or so, a total of seven batches have been shipped, and together with the 300 to 400 boxes transported by the Dalian Steamship Company, they have reached more than 20 million yuan. Today, the eighth batch was shipped out by British ships yesterday, amounting to more than 2 million yuan, and will still be transported to Dalian and then to Liaoning. Including the previous seven shipments, the total amount of silver dollars transported is 24 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Two Key Telegrams from the Two-Route Party Department to the Central Government</h3>
<p>(1) Request for Universal Loan</p>
<p>(2) Restoration of Seniority Wage Increases</p>
<p>The Two-Route Special Party Department has sent telegrams to the central government, requesting the railway department to promptly handle the employee loan and seniority wage increase cases. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Emergency Loan for War, Executive Committee of the Central Party Department in Nanjing: According to the Yuan telegram from the Jinghu-Huhangyong Railway Workers' Union, Executive Committee of the Special Party Committee of the Jinghu-Huhangyong Railway: Regarding the loan for war loss relief for employees of the two routes, requests have been repeatedly received from Nanjing, Changzhou, Zhakou, Machine Factory, and the Huhang-Shaoxing sections, requesting that they be issued together regardless of jurisdiction, and telegrams have been sent to urge prompt approval. The management bureau has truthfully forwarded them to the railway department and urgently requested prompt approval. Furthermore, another telegram was received from Shaoxing and Nanjing, Changzhou, etc., stating that the situation is urgent and requesting relief to avoid unexpected events. The Zhenri Huhang section, from the Xinzhuan to Zhakou stations, held a meeting in Jiaxing with representatives to request a loan, and on Wenri, they requested a special train at Zhakou Station to petition in Shanghai, but were unsuccessful. The Zhakou Machine Factory announced yesterday and today that they would break with Hui Gong to show their determination. This afternoon, they sent more than 50 representatives to the bureau to petition. The committee has repeatedly advised them to stay calm and not to expand the situation. If the department does not approve the request, it is feared that the matter will escalate and there will be no way to deal with it. In addition to sending a telegram to the local authorities requesting prompt approval, this telegram is sent to inform you.</p>

<p>Please, your committee, ensure the safety of the two-route employees in accordance with the law. In addition to forwarding the telegram to the railway department for prompt handling and ordering the two-route unions to await resolution, this special telegram is sent for inspection and implementation to avoid accidents and benefit the party. Jinghu-Huhang section Railway Special Party Committee Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Urgent Seniority Wage Increase, Central Executive Committee: It has been found that the railway department's general order No. 3163 stipulates that seniority wage increases for railway employees, except for special merit, may not be universally granted, which has become a bad example, increases the huge annual burden, fosters the habit of employees seeking advancement, and intends to abolish the precedent of seniority wage increases. Since this order was announced, all employees of the two routes have been extremely agitated, and there is widespread panic, as if a major disaster is about to occur. As a matter of duty, this committee cannot remain silent. Railway employees sacrifice their lifelong efforts and contribute to railway administration, hoping only for this seniority wage increase. If this hope is suddenly dashed, how can they be encouraged to serve loyally? According to the precedent of seniority wage increases, railway employees are entitled to seniority wage increases as their work history and experience increase. Moreover, in the event of death or resignation, new hires are paid at the lowest level, which does not increase the railway bureau's budget. As for those with special merit, there are separate reward measures. Today's order from the railway department not only does not benefit railway administration but also incites employee unrest and creates unprecedented panic on the two routes. It has been found that the railway department has recently arbitrarily added redundant personnel, established agencies, and has been unrestrained, resulting in the railway burden increasing several times annually. If this continues, the railway will inevitably go bankrupt. The railway department's unnecessary waste has only increased, while the seniority wage increase system that examines employees and promotes railway administration is now being canceled, which is particularly infuriating to employees of this route. Because the Shanghai-Hangyong station team members have not yet announced their seniority wage increases for the twenty-first year, they have all gathered and repeatedly petitioned the railway bureau, which promised to respond on the 20th of this month. If a satisfactory solution is not found, the situation will inevitably escalate. I beseech your committee to order the railway department to immediately announce and withdraw the order No. 3163 and maintain the precedent of seniority wage increases on this route. Furthermore, employees in all stations and factories, except for the Shanghai and Songjiang factories, have not been paid, which is extremely unfair, causing employees throughout the route to petition. The cold telegram has been submitted to your office for investigation. I beseech you to strictly order the railway department to immediately order the railway bureau to pay them all to show fairness and avoid accidents. The telegram is sent urgently and awaits orders. Executive Committee of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Special Party Department, Council of the Two-Route Unions.</p>
<h3>Telegram to All Employees from the Two Railway Unions</h3>
<p>Four Expectations for Director Huang</p>
<p>The two railway unions telegraphed: "To all employees of all sections, offices, factories, and stations of the two railways, and to all members of the branch offices: We have recently sent a telegram to Huang Hao, Director of the Railway Administration, which reads: 'To Huang, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways Administration: Since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, we have suffered greatly. The victims along the entire two railway lines are countless, and the suffering is beyond words. We earnestly hope that the Railway Administration will implement policies to help those affected, so that the employees in distress can soon return to their normal lives. Although the production volume of the railway administration did not decrease significantly even during the war, there have been no commendations to encourage employees after the restoration of peace, despite their loyalty. First, the salary increase policy for employees earning over 100 yuan was suspended. Then, relief loans were divided based on war and non-war zones. Now, even seniority-based salary increases are being cancelled with flimsy excuses. All of these issues, which the previous Director Chen Xinghan failed to resolve satisfactorily, have been brewing and causing unrest throughout the railways. His sudden resignation has left the employees of both railways feeling lost and fearful. We are deeply disappointed. Fortunately, you have been appointed as the new director. We hope that you will quickly implement new policies and show benevolence. Therefore, the hopes that the employees of both railways placed on the previous Director Chen are now transferred to you. We believe that you are already aware of these issues and have good solutions to soothe the anxieties of our employees. We hereby present to you four urgent matters that need to be resolved: (1) The relief funds for the employees of the two railways have been approved by the ministry, but are limited to war zones. However, since the war began, the entire railway line has been affected. Although Shanghai suffered the most severe damage, almost every day for more than a month, Japanese planes bombed the areas along the railway line to disrupt transportation. All employees in various sections and stations risked their lives to transport goods. Their loyalty is self-evident. Moreover, the panic in various ports and the tight market conditions caused untold suffering. Limiting the relief to war zones is unfair to those who faced similar dangers. Therefore, we requested that the relief be distributed without geographical restrictions, but the previous Director Chen failed to find a way to persuade the ministry to make an exception, leading to increasing public anger. This issue must be resolved immediately and cannot be ignored. (2) The salary increase issue for January and July of this year has been properly handled in other sections, but the Shanghai-Hangzhou section's Transportation Department delayed the announcement until November. After repeated requests, the matter was submitted, and the department sent representatives to Shanghai to demand action. The Railway Administration initially promised a decision within ten days, but then stated that the salary increase was being processed when the ministry issued a suspension order, causing the process to be interrupted. This situation is causing concern. It is reasonable to assume that the ministry's suspension order applied to the entire railway after August 1st of this year, but the Shanghai-Hangzhou section's salary increase should have been processed with other sections before the order, and should not be restricted. This is unfair and unreasonable. We request that you address this issue immediately and fairly, and release the salary increases as soon as possible to reassure the employees and maintain stability on the railways. (3) Railway employees sacrifice their lives and work diligently, hoping only for seniority-based salary increases. However, the ministry suddenly issued an order stating that this has become a bad practice and that only those with special merits can receive these increases. The right to seniority-based salary increases involves filling vacancies with the lowest-ranking employees in a cyclical manner, which does not increase the Railway Administration's budget. Special merits should be rewarded separately through medals. Cancelling seniority-based salary increases will not only be detrimental to the railway, but will also make employees feel insecure, causing unprecedented panic. To protect the legal rights of employees, we must request that you immediately submit a request to the ministry to rescind this order and maintain the existing practice of seniority-based salary increases. (4) Railways are national production agencies and cannot be compared to other types of agencies. Since the beginning of the two railways, a bonus has been awarded at the end of the year to show compassion. This bonus comes from 20% of the railway's annual surplus, used to reward hard work and not wasting national funds. Now, there are rumors of cancellation, which will extinguish all hope for employees. If we are not good to them, how can we expect them to work hard? This small expense benefits the people and does no harm to the nation. In this time of anxiety, such inauspicious news is unsettling. Although these are just rumors, we urge you to investigate and prevent them from becoming reality. Please approve and announce the bonuses soon to reassure the employees. The above four points are urgent matters that cannot be delayed. As you have been entrusted with great responsibility and are the hope of the people, we urge you to exert all your strength to resolve these issues immediately and prevent any further accidents. We submit this to you and hope for your wise consideration. We eagerly await your response. The Council of the Railway Unions of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways under the Ministry of Railways.' This is the telegram." The Seal of the Council of the Two Railway Unions.</p>
<h3>Two Warships Conducted Artillery Tests Outside Wusong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zeng Yiding and Li Shijia Personally Supervised the Tests</p>
<p>The navy's new cruisers, Yixian and Ninghai, were ordered by Minister Chen Shaokuan to conduct artillery tests and target practice on the sea outside Wusong. Preparations were completed, and the ships sailed to sea the day before yesterday. The ministry sent Permanent Vice Minister Li Shijia and Second Fleet Commander Zeng Yiding to inspect the tests. Zeng arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning by overnight train from Nanjing. After arriving, he accompanied Li Shijia by car to Wusong and boarded the Yixian. The target practice is expected to last about a week.</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Training Ships Scheduled to Sail to Shanghai and Then to the South Seas</h3>
<p>The Japanese navy training ships Iwate and Yakumo, after arriving in Qingdao, are scheduled to sail to Shanghai on the 22nd of this month. They will stay in Shanghai for about two days for sightseeing and then leave Shanghai on the 24th, heading for Hong Kong and the South Seas.</p>
<h3>Continued Records of Kong Xiangxi's Inspection Tour</h3>
<p>Further news regarding the inspection tour of Mr. Kong Xiangxi, special envoy for industrial affairs to Europe and America. We have received correspondence from New York, stating that Mr. Kong, along with his entourage, has recently been engaged in propaganda work in New York regarding the Sino-Japanese issue. Over a period of ten days, the American Foreign Policy Association, the Sino-American Association, the Sino-American Cultural Association, the Pacific Association, and the YMCA held meetings and invited him to give lectures. The topics of his lectures were mostly about the Northeast China issue and China's construction plans. After the lectures, discussions were held. It is reported that there was a heated debate at the American Foreign Policy Association. Journalists with extensive knowledge of Eastern affairs, such as Socks and Feffe, were present and strongly sided with Japan. Mr. Kong vehemently refuted their arguments, and his wife and entourage also joined the debate, which was very intense. Socks and Feffe later changed their attitude in their newspaper articles. Important figures from the American Foreign Policy Association, such as Bi, have recently published articles in newspapers advocating that the United States should unite with other countries to impose an economic embargo on Japan. Recently, Chinese and American figures have been secretly active on this matter. Mr. Kong recently gave a lecture at Yale University on the economic issues of Northeast China. He refuted Japan's claim that it needed to occupy Northeast China for economic reasons, using statistics on population, food, and raw materials to argue that Japan's needs were far less urgent than China's. He argued that Japan's invasion of Northeast China was due to the expansionist ambitions of its warlords. The faculty and students of the university greatly appreciated his lecture. Mr. Kong is now planning to establish a permanent propaganda organization in New York, uniting Chinese and foreign figures. The organization is already in place. As for his inspection schedule, it is reported that in mid-November, he visited the Brooklyn sugar refinery, the Baltimore copper and iron factory of Bethelem, and the Colt and Winchester armories in Hartford and New Haven.</p>

<h3>Telephone Losses in the Shanghai War</h3>
<p>Totaling Over 240,000 Yuan</p>
<p>After the January 28th Shanghai War, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau's telephone projects in Zhabei, Wusong, Zhenru, Nanxiang, and other places were destroyed by Japanese artillery fire, resulting in significant losses. The statistics on these losses were officially released by the bureau yesterday and are detailed below: (Monthly Revenue) The bureau's usual monthly revenue includes 14,000 yuan in monthly rental fees, 6,500 yuan in long-distance telephone fees, 1,000 yuan in Chinese and foreign telephone membership fees, 2,000 yuan in private line fees, and 500 yuan in installation and transfer fees, totaling 24,000 yuan. During the Shanghai War, only 6,000 yuan was received, resulting in a loss of over 18,000 yuan. (Production) Losses in production: 70,000 yuan for the Zhabei branch, 8,000 yuan for the Dingwan branch, 2,000 yuan for the Nanxiang branch, 3,000 yuan for the Wusong branch, 2,000 yuan for long-distance lines, 1,000 yuan for new long-distance projects, 15,000 yuan for wooden poles in inventory, 102,800 yuan for wire rope, 10,000 yuan for building damage, and 5,000 yuan for personal belongings of employees at the Zhabei branch, totaling 218,800 yuan. (Restoration Costs) After the war, the bureau immediately sent personnel to repair the damaged projects to maintain communication. The project cost was initially estimated at 3,000 yuan, but due to the addition of tools and raincoats, it exceeded 2,000 yuan. The total cost of the restoration project for the Zhabei branch and the headquarters was 5,825.28 yuan. The total loss from the above three items is over 242,600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customs to Divide Sections for Cargo Inspection</h3>

<h3>Record of the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Federation</h3>
<p>The Chinese Federation held its 20th annual meeting at the association's auditorium at 3 p.m. on the 18th. Those in attendance included Dr. Wu Liande, Xu Jigong, Zhao Yu, Wu Tingpei, Lu Qingliang, Huang Jianzhong, Xu Yuanlong, Wu Jishun, Xu Zhiyan, Qiu Hanping, Situ Shang, Wang Yunyu, Li Guohua, Zhang Xiqi, and over a hundred others. Xu Jigong presided over the meeting, with Yao Zhenlong recording. After the rituals, the chairman reported on the association’s history, stating that the association was founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in coordination with overseas Chinese leaders such as Mr. Wu Shirong and Dr. Wu Liande. At that time, the first official chairman was Mr. Wang Jingwei, and the vice-chairman was Mr. Wu Shirong. When Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, the Chinese Federation increased its opposition, and suffered suppression. The association's affairs were briefly suspended, but soon revived after Yuan's death. Last year, due to a misunderstanding with the party department regarding overseas Chinese affairs, it suffered another setback and almost stopped operating. After clarification, the situation was resolved. The association’s contribution to the revolution cannot be overstated, and we have no regrets in serving our motherland. That is why Sun Yat-sen said, "Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution," which shows the importance of overseas Chinese to the revolution of our motherland. Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the association has telegraphed overseas Chinese around the world, appealing for economic aid. The amount raised was no less than ten million, but the association did not handle the funds directly, resulting in the creation of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Economic Committee, with Zhu Qinglan, Zheng Hongnian, and Xu Shiying serving as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. Later, Zhu Qinglan went to the Northeast, so Xu Shiying and Li Denghui took over as chairman and vice-chairman. At the same time, the association, recognizing the endless aggression of Japanese imperialism, organized the Chinese Federation News Agency to expose their atrocities. In light of the widespread suffering of the refugees after the Shanghai Incident and the lack of medical care for the poor, the Chinese Federation Hospital was established to provide free medical treatment and medicine to the poor and sick. At the same time, recognizing the need for a channel of communication between overseas Chinese and their motherland, the Chinese Federation Bi-Weekly was published. Furthermore, in order to understand the economic life, personal suffering, treatment of overseas Chinese in various countries, and immigration regulations, there was a motivation to establish an Overseas Chinese Cultural Museum. The above represents a brief overview of the association’s work since its revival. As I am old and weak, I hereby announce my resignation at the annual meeting to rest." Dr. Wu Liande then gave a speech, stating that the contribution of overseas Chinese to the Republic of China is already expressed in Sun Yat-sen's words, "Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution." We can say that without the financial aid of overseas Chinese, Sun Yat-sen’s revolution and the Republic of China would not have been born, and we would still be under the rule of the Manchus. This is not an exaggeration. The process of establishing the association has already been reported by the chairman, and the details are all true. When I and Mr. Wu and others assisted Dr. Sun Yat-sen in establishing this association, it was to unite overseas Chinese for the great construction of the country. Now, we must continue to strive with the same spirit as before. Since Mr. Xu took office as chairman, he has devoted himself to reorganizing the association, which has been a great contribution. Therefore, I sincerely hope that he will continue to be responsible. Mr. Wu Yingpei then gave a speech, stating that the association was born at the same time as the Republic of China. The details have already been explained by Chairman Xu and Dr. Wu, so there is no need to repeat them. I have a proposal to organize an overseas Chinese club to connect the emotions of overseas Chinese from various places. As for Mr. Xu's resignation, we cannot accept his request. Discussion Items: (1) Organize an overseas Chinese club: Nine preparatory committee members were elected, including Xu Jigong, Wu Yingpei, Wu Jishun, Huang Jianzhong, Qiu Hanping, Wang Yunyu, Wang Guanbin, Zhang Chuming, and Xu Zhiyan, to be convened by Wu Yingpei. (2) Elect three members to review and revise the charter, including Huang Jianzhong, Qiu Hanping, and Wang Zhonglin, to be convened by Huang Jianzhong. (3) Elect seven members to prepare for the re-election, including Xu Jigong, Zhao Yu, Wu Yingpei, Huang Jianzhong, Wang Yunyu, Qiu Hanping, and Wu Jishun, to be convened by Xu Jigong. (4) Xu Jigong's resignation as chairman should be decided after more than 480 overseas organizations have made their selections. Before the selections are made, Xu Jigong will continue to serve as chairman. (5) The assembly unanimously elected Mr. Huang Jianzhong as the general director of the association, but Mr. Huang declined due to business matters and his imminent return to Sumatra in the South Seas. Efforts are still being made to persuade him. (6) It was resolved to hire Chen Wulie as the honorary chairman of the Chinese Federation Hospital and Wu Liande as the honorary director. Finally, the entire group took a photo, and the meeting adjourned at 7 p.m.</p>

<h3>Nagasaki Customs Seizes ["Good Luck"] Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Due to One and Two Dime Notes Hidden in Cans</p>
<p>According to the Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun, passengers traveling to Japan from Shanghai on connecting Chinese ships all carry cigarettes. The customs authorities, due to concerns about the health and habits of passengers, stipulate that each person may carry one hundred cigarettes. Anyone exceeding one hundred cigarettes will have them confiscated. Recently, there have been rumors of valuable items being secretly hidden in Chinese cigarette cans. Therefore, the Nagasaki Customs inspects the cans of Chinese cigarettes brought into Japan by passengers. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 13th, during a can inspection of fifty "Good Luck" cigarettes produced by the Shanghai Huada Tobacco Company, one and two dime notes from the Central Bank were discovered. Customs officials were quite surprised and considered it a violation of the Customs Law for taxable items. The item was detained. However, while there are relevant regulations for opium and valuables, there are no procedures for dealing with banknotes. Later, after discussions between Anjiang Customs Chief Aoki and Chief Guard Matsuda, it was decided to send the notes to a charitable organization. It was also learned that the Huada Tobacco Company included the notes to promote sales. Therefore, the passenger carrying the cigarettes could not be charged with a crime.</p>
<h3>Examination Report</h3>

<h3>National Goods Association Disapproves Zhao Jinji's Membership</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association sent a letter to various factories yesterday because the Zhao Jinji Thermos Factory falsely claimed to be a member, stating: "On the 13th of this month, major newspapers in this city published an advertisement for the Zhao Jinji Thermos Factory, falsely claiming to be a member of this association. While we were preparing to investigate, we suddenly received Zhao Jinji's application for membership and a letter of recommendation from a member. The association sent personnel to conduct an on-site investigation. The bottle shell was indeed self-made. We then visited the bottle core factory in Yuangeng Lane, Miller Road (which is the bottle core evacuation department, not the bottle core manufacturing factory). We saw three enemies inside. When asked, the factory owner Zhao Jinyuan replied that they were technicians, responsible for evacuation work, earning 2.8 cents per piece, and would not be needed after six months. The investigation report was submitted to the Standing Committee on the 17th, and it was resolved that there was a major suspicion of substitution, and the applicant's membership could not be approved. The false claim of membership will be clarified in the newspaper. This is a matter of record and notification for your information."</p>

They immediately went forward to check. The man was wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, white socks, and black shoes. His face was bleeding profusely, and he was barely breathing. The police immediately reported to the precinct and called a car to transport the man to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. After surgery, he became slightly conscious and identified himself as Chen Gensheng, 29 years old, from Jiangyin, residing at No. 111 Yongtai Lane, Gordon Road.

<h3>Huang Lianfu Crushed to Death by Machine</h3>
<p>Huang Lianfu, a 48-year-old man from Ningbo, was working as a mechanic at the Fuxin Flour Mill on West Suzhou Road. At around 8:00 AM the day before, while oiling the machine, it was still running. He was accidentally crushed severely. People in the factory saw this and, together with Huang's brother-in-law Du Xuezhong, sent Huang to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died soon after. The hospital reported to the New Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate and took the body to the Faelun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court dispatched Prosecutor Zhan Liangce to the morgue to examine the body and record the case. Huang Aipin, the deceased's son, testified that he was 18 years old and that the deceased was his father. He had started working at the factory in May of this year, but he was originally from his hometown, so he did not know the details at the time. Du Xuezhong testified that the deceased was his brother-in-law and that he worked with him in the factory, but he worked upstairs, so he did not witness the event. After obtaining the testimony, Zhan concluded that the deceased Huang Lianfu, male, was indeed crushed to death by the machine before his death. The body was handed over to his son Huang Aipin for burial.</p>

<p>The Anhui Native Place Association sent a telegram to President Song stating: "To President Song of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, The National Government's Relief Committee for Water Disasters, under your leadership, has achieved great things, and the people of the whole country are infinitely sympathetic. However, Yang Shucheng, the transportation director used by the disaster area working group, Quan Shaowu, the Anhui Northern Relief Commissioner, Wang Fanwu, the station director in Bengbu, and Cha Liangzhao, the director of the emergency relief department, either use their power and opportunities to benefit themselves, or deduct relief funds and rice. They even use foreign employees, who do not understand the actual situation, and enjoy consular jurisdiction, to slander those who dare to be responsible, thinking that they are protecting them. This makes it impossible for the disaster victims in northern Anhui to enjoy the same benefits as the people in other provinces. Representatives who send letters and telegrams to the Water Disaster Association and the Anhui Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing and this association, requesting assistance, are continuously on the road. The associations have jointly sent representatives to conduct on-site investigations in northern Anhui, discovering various evidences, and have negotiated and formulated methods to request the Water Disaster Association to handle the matter impartially. However, because Zhu Feilan, the director of the working group, rushed north, the entire case was unresolved, and the people in more than 20 counties in northern Anhui who were affected by the disaster are angry and unstoppable. In order to represent the people and follow the legal process, this association has filed a lawsuit in court, requesting an investigation. The defendants are only the aforementioned four people. The facts of the crimes are listed in detail. If Cha Liangzhao, Quan Shaowu, etc., have evidence to the contrary, they can submit it to the court. Why is it necessary to seek external assistance? The people of Anhui have no long-standing grievances with them. If they can prove their innocence, there is no reason to make unreasonable demands. If there is evidence of guilt, then you, with your sense of justice, will not tolerate it. Shanghai Anhui Native Place Association. Telegram received, 75 tons of relief wheat were received in Xuyi, the facts are all there, how can they be concealed? Wang, the former head of the township, presented it, and this government thoroughly investigated it and found no basis for it. There are obvious irregularities. In addition to strictly investigating and notifying the court, we specifically reply in detail. Xuyi County Government, respectfully."</p>

<p>On the 11th of this month, this newspaper published a news item entitled "Strange Gunshots on the Telephone." The fact occurred at 11:00 PM on the 10th. At that time, the Zhaizhong Road Police Station in the French Concession suddenly received a strange phone call. The caller spoke urgently, repeatedly asking if it was the police station. The call taker replied that it was, asking where the call was coming from. The caller only replied with the words "French Concession." As soon as the caller finished speaking, two clear gunshots suddenly rang out on the phone, and the call was disconnected. At that time, the head of the police station urgently telegraphed the special agency and notified the various police stations in the Public Concession to do their best to investigate. However, after ten days, nothing was discovered. Only this newspaper exclusively reported the incident the next day and considered it to be bizarre, so it was placed at the top of the page to attract the attention of readers. However, after many days, the truth has never been revealed, which inevitably makes the public suspicious. In view of the importance of this case, the reporter believes that it is necessary to thoroughly investigate and give readers a satisfactory answer. Therefore, the reporter inquired until yesterday, when the reporter encountered a friend from Ningbo who discussed the case of Le Zhenbao, the owner of the Taichang Wood Shop, a large merchant from Ningbo on Nanjing Road, being kidnapped. He felt that the situation was related to the strange gunshots. (The following is all from the friend's words.) Since Le was kidnapped, a month has passed. Initially, the bandits contacted Le's family frequently. Eventually, they reduced the ransom to a minimum of 100,000 yuan. The negotiations were getting closer. Unexpectedly, after the strange gunshots occurred, the bandits disappeared without a trace. The negotiations between the two sides suddenly broke off. At that time, Le's family speculated that the bandits' hideout was probably equipped with a telephone. The hostage, when everyone was quiet at night, managed to call the police station, hoping to be rescued. Unfortunately, the bandits noticed it and shot him. This is also a possible fact. Now Le's family is extremely grief-stricken. On the one hand, they are actively investigating, hoping that this speculation is not true. Even if Le was unfortunately killed by the bandits, they must at least find the remains. After listening to the friend's words, the reporter felt that the facts were not contradictory and the situation was quite consistent. This is recorded to see what happens later.</p>
<h3>Zhu Tieying Wrongfully Drowned at Sea</h3>
<p>Only Able to Sacrifice the Small Self for the Public Good</p>
<p>The Facts are Clear, No More Groaning</p>
<p>Zhu Tieying, the editor of the Taicang Moye Newspaper, after being sentenced to three months in prison by the local court for defamation, wrote to his friend Mr. Hu from the detention center yesterday due to family economic constraints, saying that he would not appeal again. However, Zhu's friends are all urging Zhu to appeal again and fight for justice. It is said that Zhu must wait for the court's judgment to be served before deciding whether to appeal. The original letter to his friend was extremely painful. It is recorded below. (Above omitted) "After receiving the letter, I can understand that you are disappointed. However, although it does not require travel expenses to appeal to the High Court, it only requires a written statement, but it often delays the process for at least three months. My wife and children rely on me for their livelihood, and the affairs of the newspaper need me to manage them, and the economy needs me to adjust. If I extend it for another three months, my family will have unspeakable pain. What's more, it's like fighting a stone with an egg, and evil forces permeate the entire society. What justice exists in this world? What's more, the defamation law is the most vague. My heart is really unwilling, but I can only endure it. Therefore, after careful consideration, considering my environment and identity, I can only sacrifice the small self for the public good and not appeal again. Then, after 30 more days of hardship in the detention center, at the latest by the end of the lunar year, I can regain my freedom. I also know very well that it is ten thousand times more painful in the detention center than outside. I am still trying to find a way to struggle. Please ask my wife to come forward and tell you in detail. I don't want to bother anyone else to rescue me. I can only submit. After I am released, I will express my great gratitude to everyone who rescued me. Now, I can only ask you to bother Mr. Zhang once more and ask him to write a letter of withdrawal of the appeal. This procedure cannot be avoided, so as not to have to return to the detention center for the five days of sacrifice. Then, it is estimated that I can be released from prison after December 23rd or 24th of the lunar calendar and have a good meeting with you. This time, you have done your best to rescue me. The results are as follows. The tragic words of the weak can only be attributed to fate. However, the facts are clear, and there is no need to make meaningless moaning. With this, I respectfully wish you well. Your younger brother, Zhu Tieying."</p>

<p>The Old Mother Is Fond of Her Son</p>
<p>Requests the Judge Not to Reduce the Sentence</p>

She has a son named Heshang, who is 28 years old, does not engage in honest work, and only associates with vagrants, indulging in gambling and pleasure-seeking. His mother often scolds him, but her admonitions are met with abuse. She only has this one son and can do nothing but sigh and weep all day long. A month ago, the mother slightly rebuked him for something, and Heshang wanted to strike her with his fists. After the neighbors persuaded him to stop, at around 6 PM the day before yesterday, Heshang gambled outside and lost, returning home with anger in his chest. The mother slightly questioned him, and he began to roar, grabbed a cleaver, and threatened his mother. The mother was terrified and fled out the door, screaming for help. Just as Hua Tan Liu Changgen heard the alarm and arrived, he questioned the situation and immediately arrested Tao Heshang, took him to the Yangshupu Police Station, reported to the head of the police, and ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Summary Court of the First Special District.

Judge Zhang Junqing sentenced Tao Heshang to 30 days of detention as a warning.</p>

<h3>Robbery</h3>
<p>Li Heji Wooden Workshop: At No. 8 Kuaijia Lane, Jiuxiaochang, Chengnan, the Li Heji Redwood Workshop opened by local resident Li Housheng, was suddenly attacked by five local-sounding robbers at around 9 PM the day before yesterday. One of the robbers was a woman in a blue cheongsam, with five pistols hidden in her chest. They first lurked at the entrance of the Li family to guard and stopped pedestrians from entering. The robbers then obtained pistols from the female robber and went straight to the Li residence. They also went to the home of Su Jinrong, who set up a vegetarian chicken stall at the City God Temple, and used pistols to intimidate them. They then went to the Li's inner room and used a hatchet to break open the redwood glass cabinet and leather suitcase, and stole two gold lockets, one gold chain, four gold rings, two gold buttons, one gold bracelet, two men's leather robes, and one black wool coat. Afterwards, the victim reported to Xu Chenghuang, the chief of the second precinct of the first district, who sent police to pursue the robbers, but they had already escaped. The case has been reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for pursuit.</p>

Yesterday (the 19th) at 10:05 AM, two robbers, one wearing a copper basin on his head, wearing a blue serge shirt and pants, speaking with a northern accent, and about 30 years old, each armed with a pistol, one guarded at the door, and the other took advantage of the pawnshop clerk's departure to buy small coins, and broke into the shop, holding a gun to intimidate the counter staff and preventing them from making a sound. They immediately grabbed 63 yuan and 120 small coins from the counter drawer, opened the fence and fled. Afterwards, the manager of the pawnshop reported the situation to the Dada Ziminzhong Police Station and requested an arrest.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I read in your newspaper on the 15th of this month an article stating that unscrupulous merchants in the electrical appliance industry were selling enemy goods, and that the National Products Maintenance Association had sent a letter to your newspaper to advise our association. After investigation, our association has not received any letter from the association. It is feared that someone is borrowing the name of patriotism to try to damage the reputation of our association. In addition to sending a letter to the association to inquire about the truth, we are afraid of confusing the public, and we should ask your newspaper to make a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Electrical Appliance Industry Association, December 19th.</p>
<h3>Reader Advice</h3>
<p>(1) Discussion on the Question Raised by Mr. Bao Zhizheng</p>
<p>|| Original letter seen in this column on the 17th of this month</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Gengsheng's message: After reading the letter, we only feel boundless indignation accumulating in our hearts, wanting to burst out. | Is it not right to ban fortune-telling, astrology, witchcraft, geomancy? But there is only a text on banning, after the banning, what [legitimate occupation] are they engaged in? Where [factories established locally] are they invested in? How [to make them bear the corresponding work]? These are all big things, and it will not be successful if we do not start from the root; but when will the root of the matter be realized? This is one. Secondly, those who are fortune-tellers and astrologers have already realized and [are willing to change careers], but the [Public Security Bureau] [orders them to continue business as usual], which is nothing less than [the world's strange talk]? It turns out that the [wives and young masters] of these [officials] need [them to pray for them] when they have [diseases]; therefore, although the Jiangsu Provincial Government has [seven banning measures], the [Public Security Bureau] still [orders them to continue business as usual]. Not enough [orders], more need [obligation], not enough [obligation], plus [all kinds of extortion], [grabbing] [black fees], all these kinds of things make it difficult for us to understand what world it is today? Although, these are all digressions, in my opinion, if you are not willing to be subjected to this [dark] [coercion], the only [new way out] is to [resist] it without hesitation. You can unite your [ninety] or so [companies] and jointly submit it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Supervisory Yuan, asking them to thoroughly investigate and deal with it. I think [the authorities] still hope that politics will be clarified, and they will definitely give considerable punishment to this kind of [black] [Public Security Bureau]. Secondly, there is the issue of future occupations. Since there are no factories in your place, this layer is indeed extremely difficult, but since the banning measures clearly stipulate a time limit, it seems that you can gradually change careers separately within the stipulated time limit, so that you will not feel sudden and unprepared. If a lot of time has been delayed due to the [order] of the Public Security Bureau, you can also explain the reasons and apply to the competent authorities for an extension. As for the industry to be changed, there is no certainty. Those who are physically strong can engage in agriculture, those who are better in writing can fill in the records, and the rest can all be merchants, but blind people have a problem. In short, a sudden reform will inevitably have considerable difficulties. Wait a few days, and everything will not be a problem. Fortunately, you and your colleagues should not worry about the difficulty of changing careers. A temporary pain can be exchanged for endless hope in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Gu Runsheng's message: I am an 18-year-old youth who graduated from junior high school this year during the summer vacation. My original intention was to continue my studies, but my grandfather did not agree. Because he is running a shop in XX and the business is not bad. But my father always doesn't care about things and smokes opium at home all day long. My grandfather's intention is to have me help him in his shop. He said that going to school is just that, and now I should practice as soon as possible, and I will be the successor in the future. But I think that my grandfather is still working hard (he is now in his sixties), and the economy is still relatively well-off. I can take this opportunity to discuss my further studies. Besides, I am now very young, and I have no clue about the ways of the world, human feelings, business conditions, and accounts. Even if I sit in the shop all day, I can't help him. It's really not good for everyone. So I talked to the old man several times. He didn't agree at first, and then when he got anxious, he said that I was young and didn't understand things and didn't love to improve. Sir, don't you think this is wrong? ...</p>
<p>Now there is nothing else to say. Although I have been imprisoned in the shop by the old man, my idea of going to school has not been dispelled. Sir, please teach me a way!</p>
<p>[Answer] This magazine deeply sympathizes with your eagerness to improve. Your grandfather's opinion may seem [outdated] to young people, but it also has its reasons. Presumably, your grandfather's current career is the result of his lifelong hard work. He certainly has no deep belief in the knowledge of books. In addition, many school graduates now often disappoint the elders; of course, his opinion is different from yours. Originally, book knowledge and practical experience are complementary. . Knowledge without experience is floating knowledge; experience without knowledge is narrow experience. Today's school education mostly focuses less on practice and more on theory, which is to seek knowledge while ignoring experience; so going to school does not necessarily achieve the desired result; no wonder people doubt it. For example, you think that now [you have no clue about the ways of the world, human feelings, business conditions, and accounts], so you want to go to school, but even after graduating from university, [you are afraid that you will still have no clue about the ways of the world], even if [business conditions and accounts] are seen in books, but what is recorded in the books is only the essentials, and the real situation in the business world is still ever-changing, making people [have no clue]. Moreover, your grandfather does not want you to take charge alone now, but only to [practice]. This is a great opportunity. Since you are eager to improve, you may as well study on your own in your spare time. In this way, you will link the experience you have gained with the knowledge in the books, and what you gain in half a year will definitely match the achievements of one year in school, or be more practical. Don't over-believe in school education and miss a good opportunity.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province School Teachers and Staff Representatives' Request for Funds Has Made Some Progress</h3>
<p>Representatives Confer with the Education Fund Management Office</p>
<p>Method of Issuing Two and a Half to Three and a Half Months</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Petition to Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>More than 30 representatives from various schools of the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Teachers' Association Provisional Plenipotentiary Representative Assembly went to the Education Fee Management Office at 7:00 PM on the 17th to discuss funding issues with Director Niu and Section Chief Liu of the office. As reported yesterday, the two sides exchanged opinions until after 10:00 PM, resulting in the following decisions: The funding notice for the second half of August will be filled out and issued on October 9th of this year, with a deadline of the 25th of this month. Funds can be withdrawn from the bank upon expiration. The Medical Examination Committee will sign and issue funding notices for September and October on the 25th of this month. The deadline for the September document is January 15th, with funds available for withdrawal from the bank upon expiration. The October document will be filled out in two installments: one on January 20th and the other on January 25th, with funds available for withdrawal from the bank upon expiration (the above refers to receiving cash). For November funding, it was decided that county and township teachers' colleges and experimental primary schools will continue to follow the old practice of advance payment. Schools will either go to the respective counties to withdraw funds or negotiate with the Finance Department to order the counties to raise funds as a substitute for the counties to repay the outstanding educational expenses to the province. The issuance of the (November) payment notice will either be filled out and issued on the 25th of this month or wait until the beginning of next month. This will be determined after Section Chief Yang returns to Nanjing after urging payment. Regarding urging the provincial government to repay the accumulated outstanding provincial education funds (before the division in the 19th year of the Republic, a total of more than 1.9 million was owed; after the division, 700,000 was owed; in the 19th and 20th years, 365,000 was owed in provincial subsidies, totaling nearly 3 million), if collected, it would be enough to cover one year's worth of education expenses in Jiangsu Province. Therefore, the root cause of the accumulated educational fees in Jiangsu Province does not lie in the Management Office, but in the Finance Department, and not in the Finance Department, but in the misappropriation by various county and bureau affiliated to the Finance Department. It is reported that the Songjiang Finance Bureau reported that only 20,000 was owed in education fees, but after the Management Office sent Section Chief Yang Zishen to audit the accounts, it was found that the amount should be more than 60,000. Such concealment is not limited to one county. The Management Office is currently trying to rectify this situation. Accordingly, the representatives held a meeting at the Management Office and unanimously decided that each school represented at the meeting should send at least one representative (those with two or three or more representatives from each school in this session should still go as a principle, unless there are special matters), totaling several dozens of people, to go to Zhenjiang with the section chief of the Management Office on the morning of the 19th to urge the provincial government for payment. The 18th was a Sunday. In the afternoon at 6:00 PM, Niu Tixsheng hosted a banquet for the school representatives at Jinlingchun, and Section Chief Yang Zishen reported on the situation of urging payment and discussed the method of issuing two and a half to three and a half months' worth of funding. The next day, the entire group went to Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Recommendations from the League of Nations Education Survey Team</p>
<h3>Preliminary Plan for Reforming Chinese Education (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Necessary Efficient School Administration, Teacher Profession, and School System</p>
<p>At the request of the Chinese government, the League of Nations Administrative Council commissioned an expert education survey team from the International Cultural Cooperation Society to come to China to conduct surveys in order to improve the Chinese education system and facilitate cultural exchange between China and foreign countries. The team consisted of four members: 1. Professor Becker of the University of Berlin, former Prussian Minister of Education; 2. Professor Falska, Director of Elementary Education of the Polish Ministry of Education; 3. Professor Langevin of the University of France; 4. Professor Tawney of the London School of Economics and Political Science. They arrived in Shanghai on September 30th of last year and conducted surveys in China for more than three months. The places they visited included Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beijing, Dingxian, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Guangzhou, etc. After returning to their countries in the spring of this year, they compiled an English report entitled "The Improvement of Chinese Education." After the book was sent to the Ministry of Education in Nanjing, the Ministry ordered editors to translate it into Chinese. It took a month to translate the original book. On the 16th of this month, the National Economic Commission rushed to print 200 copies and distributed them to relevant parties for reference. It is said that the Ministry of Education believes that the report has made a great contribution to the improvement of Chinese education and plans to print and sell it as a separate volume in the future. The original report is divided into two parts: the first part is a general discussion of the situation of Chinese education, the administrative system, and the current school system, with severe criticisms and suggestions in each chapter; the second part discusses primary, secondary, and university education, with detailed criticisms and suggestions on educational standards and methods. The original book contains more than 100,000 words. Due to the limitations of space, this newspaper now records its conclusion, "Preliminary Plan for Reforming Chinese Education," as follows for the reference of researchers.</p>
<p>Preliminary Plan for Reforming Chinese Education The education system of a country is the strongest link in national unity. This has always been recognized in China. However, the recent development under various foreign influences has seriously endangered the unity of national culture. Therefore, the beginning of our proposal is to rebuild this unity under the current changing situation in China and emphasize the national and social nature of the Chinese education system. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to build:</p>
<p>㈠ An efficient school administration to introduce and manage modern education. The main conditions for this establishment are: A. Consolidate the authority and power of the Minister of Education. 1. Expand the scope of action, especially regarding the power of appointment (the main personnel of the affiliated education departments should be appointed by the Minister after consultation with the local authorities or based on the recommendations of the local authorities). 2. People who have a relationship with education (such as special committees and advisory meetings at all levels of administration, retired officials, appointed and publicly elected representatives of teachers and staff, parents of children, and the public) should elect representatives to assist the Minister. B. Unified administration. The three levels of the Ministry of Education, provincial education departments, and county education bureaus constitute an administrative unit. The upper level often governs the lower level, and their powers are stipulated separately, but they are interconnected in terms of administration and finance. Higher education is governed by the Education Department, while elementary education is governed by the county education bureaus.</p>
<p>㈡ An efficient teacher profession A. Teacher training must be reformed. All teachers in the country should be subject to a uniform standard prescribed by the state, and it is recommended that the state conduct teacher examinations, starting with secondary school teacher examinations, followed by the rest. B. The salaries of teachers at all levels should be stipulated according to a certain grade and paid on time. The lack of job security for teachers is the main reason for the current instability and reduced efficiency of the teaching profession. The number of university chairs and teacher positions should be fixed, but they must be stable. The appointment of teachers should be based entirely on qualifications, and dismissal should only be allowed in cases of proven incompetence or for disciplinary purposes. Teachers should be appointed by the主管敎育機關, not by the principal.</p>
<p>㈢ An efficient school system A. To build a truly efficient education system for the whole country, elementary education must be compulsory. The goal should be six years of compulsory education, but the current four years of compulsory education can also be recognized due to local circumstances. Since compulsory education is implemented, elementary education must be free. All children who enter school should not pay fees. Elementary schools are the foundation of the entire system. Under the current situation, the development of Chinese elementary schools is crucial. The implementation of compulsory education must be carefully prepared based on on-site investigations in pilot cities and counties. Because elementary education is fundamentally important, the National Government and the provinces should allocate funds for this purpose. The Ministry of Education should establish a special Elementary Education Department. Also, if the number of students taught by each teacher and each school is increased, there is still room for further improvement in the efficiency of school and teacher utilization.</p>

<p>Shanghai University Federation Telegraphs the Third Plenary Session</p>
<h3>Do Not Restrict Private Individuals from Establishing Universities and Liberal Arts Departments</h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Federation held a temporary executive committee meeting at Jiaoyuan on Avenue Road yesterday afternoon. Those present included Zhang Shouyong, Hu Qibing, and Zhu Shijun from Guanghua University, Wang Yuxiang from Daxia University, Yu Nanqiu, Wen Chongxin, and Zhang Yi from Fudan University, Li Yingzha and Hu Duanxing from Jiaotong University, Liu Zhanen from Shanghai University, Xu Peikun from Shanghai Business College, and Yang Yufen from Jinan University. The meeting was chaired by Zhang Shouyong and recorded by Zhang Yi. The chairman reported that the temporary meeting was convened because the content of the "Reform of Higher Education Plan" proposed by the Central Organization Committee of the Third Plenary Session, as reported in the newspapers yesterday, was extremely important and related to the education system and the cultivation of talent. He asked everyone to discuss it as much as possible in order to gather opinions and present them to the central authorities for reference. Subsequently, the representatives discussed it repeatedly for a long time and all agreed that it was necessary to state opinions on the first and seventh items in the original proposal. It was then decided that Shanghai University, Fudan University, and Daxia University should immediately draft a telegram to the Third Plenary Session, the Central Political Conference, the Ministry of Education, and other institutions. Chu Minyi and Wang Bo were publicly recommended to present the case to the Third Plenary Session, and Wang Yuxiang and Zhang Yi were recommended to go to Beijing to handle everything. The text of the telegram is found below:</p>
<p>To the gentlemen of the Third Plenary Session, Mr. Cai Yuanpei: The reform of the education system proposed by the Central Organization Committee in this Third Plenary Session proposes that all universities in the country should be established by the Ministry of Education and that all provincial and municipal governments, bodies, and private individuals should not be allowed to establish liberal arts colleges. Those that have already been established should be merged into state-run schools or ordered to close down. This case will certainly be rejected after discussion by the general assembly. However, for the sake of Chinese education, this association cannot remain silent. To stipulate that all universities in the country be established by the Ministry of Education is a violation of educational principles and the precedents of European and American countries. In fact, the central government has no financial resources to shoulder this responsibility. Looking at the state-run schools that already exist, the government is already experiencing various difficulties in the annual maintenance fees. Today, China's education policy should promote production and practicality, but liberal arts are also necessary for training citizens and developing culture. How can we abandon food because of choking? Looking at the number of university students in our country today, less than one in ten thousand people has the opportunity to enter university, which is already too narrow. In this budding period, the government should do its best to promote it. If it is said that the content is not perfect, there are many ways to guide improvement. It is definitely not the responsibility of the government to promote education by closing schools. The establishment of various private universities has been decades for the old and nearly ten years for the recent. Private individuals have worked hard to create the rudimentary foundation of today. Those who propose the proposal do not cultivate what has already been established, but want to use the name of reform to carry out destruction. It is difficult to understand in terms of reason and difficult to solve. The pillars of the party-state and the advanced education workers can carefully consider the pros and cons and consider everything in detail, so that a ray of life for national education will not be interrupted by this. Please ask the gentlemen of the general assembly to reject the proposal immediately. The future of the party-state is fortunate, and national education is fortunate. Shanghai University Federation bowed.</p>

<p>Return Nanjing School Site, Move Middle School Department to Beijing</p>
<p>Build Library, Gymnasium, and Nanyang Museum</p>
<p>Raise One Million in Funds to Develop Natural Sciences</p>
<p>National Jinan University, founded at the end of the Qing Dynasty, is the only educational institution for overseas Chinese. After this national crisis, it is urgently seeking to improve. During this recovery, a large-scale library, gymnasium, and Nanyang Museum will be built for research. However, the school has no foundation, and the Ministry of Education has accumulated more than one million in fees over the years. Not only is expansion impossible, but maintenance is also difficult. It is reported that the school took advantage of the absence of various directors of the Third Plenary Session on the afternoon of the 17th, except for Chen Yaoyuan, who was still abroad, and Song Ziwen, who was absent due to business. It is estimated that those present included Lin Sen, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Ma Chaojun, Chen Lifu, Yu Jintang, and兼校長 Zheng Hongnian, totaling seven people. Lin Sen presided over the meeting. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Request the Ministry of Education to promptly allocate more than one million yuan in arrears and increase the budget for operating expenses in installments in order to carry out the revitalization plan and amortize old debts. (2) Request the Ministry of Education to forward a request to the government to return the Nanjing school site so that the middle school department can be moved to Beijing. (3) When the government allocates the arrears, a library, gymnasium, and Nanyang Museum should be built separately, and the library should be rebuilt first. (4) Raise one million yuan in funds, with emphasis on developing natural science.</p>

<h3>Practical Massage and Corrective Gymnastics</h3>
<p>Written by American Massage Therapist Hartvig Nissen</p>
<p>Translated by Sports Experts Chen Kuisheng and Jin Zhaojun</p>
<p>The [Sports Series] published by the Diligence Bookstore, opposite the National Sports Promotion Association on Father Luo Shen Road, Shanghai, already has more than 30 titles and is popular throughout the country. Today, [Practical Massage and Corrective Gymnastics] is published. The book was originally compiled by Hartvig Nissen, a highly renowned expert in massage and corrective gymnastics, based on his 45 years of research experience and practice. It is considered a highly valuable work in the American medical and sports communities. The translators, Jin Zhaojun, professor of physical education at the Central University, and Chen Kuisheng, physical education instructor at the Hunan Provincial First Normal School, translated it because they saw the lack of such specialized scientific books in China, and wanted to provide it for research, reference, and practical use by the Chinese people. The translators have used the translated manuscript four times in the Yueyun School of Hunan and the Department of Physical Education of the National Central University. All medical, pharmaceutical, physiological, anatomical, and action terms in the original book have been translated into Chinese with reference. The greatest contribution of this book is that in addition to correcting posture and treating injuries, various surgeries and movements can often achieve special effects on diseases of the nervous system, digestive system, circulatory system, and muscle system that are not easily treated by ordinary medicine. It is truly the gospel of treatment and the savior of patients. The entire book has more than 200,000 words and more than 100 illustrations. It is a must-have textbook for universities and physical education departments studying specialized sports books. Printed on Daolin paper, hardcover, priced at 2.90 yuan, special price 10% off.

<h3>Gold Speculation Continues to Weaken, Main Reason... Spot Goods Flood in from the North</h3>
<h3>Morning Session Opened Higher Briefly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London reports, the near-term price should not be moved, and the far-term price was slightly higher at 0625. The British-American exchange rate has fallen back to 125, and the American-British rate has increased by one point to 4375. Although American cotton rose by more than ten pounds, the American bank still did not move, and the forward price fell. The bank private telegram should not move, and the market situation was stagnant. The gold price opened slightly higher by seven cents, at 807.8 taels. Goods were slightly higher (opening at 8.1 taels). Therefore, although Tianfeng Yong, Hengyu, and Heng were selling, the gold price rebounded and rose to 10 taels. At this time, Zhifeng Yong first appeared, and Dadecheng also sold, retreating to 8.2 taels. Goods entered again, returning to over 9 taels. After this, the December US dollar could be settled at 27.8125 yuan. Hengyu and Yingfeng Heng reduced to 6.3 taels. At 9:30, the HSBC exchange rate was announced. The British-American exchange rate did not move, and Wah Bi sold the January US dollar at 875. Zhifeng Yong and Daxing Yong, Fuyu competed to sell, continuing a small two taels, to four and a half taels. Zhongfu, etc., entered the March US dollar at 0625, which was not easy to sell. Zhifeng was at 8 yuan, and people's hearts were still hesitant. Yuanchun and others entered slightly, jumping up two taels. However, Dadecheng sold again, but the amount was not large, so it hovered between 5 and 6 taels. After this, the exchange market trended to loosen. The March US dollar at 0625 was not easy to sell. Zhifeng Yong then continued to sell on the market, as low as 4 taels. Old Citibank sold the January dollar at 9375, and Fuxing Yong also sold, retreating to 3 taels. Hengxing came up to limit the market and buy, and the sellers raised the price to 3.5 taels, continuing to rise to 4 taels. Before long, Dehua suddenly sold the April US dollar at 28.25 yuan. Chunyuanyong and Yifengyong sold, falling to 2.3 taels. At this time, it was close to the noon closing. Hengyu paid slightly, and retail investors followed suit, rising to 3.3 taels at the closing. Goods remained high at 3.5 taels.</p>
<h3>Evening Closing Fell by Four and a Half Taels</h3>
<p>In the afternoon, continuing the afterglow of the noon closing, it opened at 3.8 taels. Retail investors continued to enter, rising by four or five cents. However, Yifeng Yong came back to sell, falling to 2.4 taels. Zhaofengchang and Dadecheng then entered, breaking through 4 taels again. After that, the March US dollar at 125 was wanted by the bank. Fuyu and Qianchangxiang successively bought in the market, and it rose to 6.5 taels. After this, the exchange market was erratic. Anda sold the US dollar at 28 yuan, and people's hearts were tired in January. Wanxing, Yifeng Yong, and Dadecheng took the opportunity to sell, falling by a little over three taels, to 3 taels. Hengxing still entered, and the price retreated to 2 taels. Yifeng and Yuanheng pulled in, returning to 4 taels. However, people's hearts were already tired. The March US dollar was at 1875, so it closed low, at 2.6 taels, a further decrease of four and a half taels compared to the previous day. It was found that spot goods had continued little for days, truly because they were coming from the north in a steady stream, so the gold price suddenly fell into a tired state. Also, the highest gold price was 810 taels, and the lowest price was 802 taels, with 8 taels of fluctuation.</p>
<h3>Opening Price Was More Than Four Taels</h3>
<p>The opening price, with the US exchange rate unchanged, was still 872.73 taels. According to the closing market, it was about 70 taels, more than 4 taels higher than the previous day.

It was calculated that Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Yifeng Yong, Hengyu, Fuyu, Daxing Yong, Chunyuanyong Yong, Fuxing Yong, Wanxing, Bingxing, etc. sold more than they bought. Fuchang, Ruikang, and Goods, on the other hand, bought in. The Cantonese Bank Yifeng and Hengxing bought in about six or seven hundred bars in total. The total number of bars from each number was about 17,000 to 18,000.</p>
<h3>Cooked Gold Added Eight Taels</h3>
<p>The cooked gold market situation was still tired. It was calculated that 8 taels were added, which was about 300 to 400 taels sold by Fuxing Yong, Baocheng, and Xinfengxiang to Tongfengheng, Dadecheng, etc.</p>
<h3>Swaps Have Not Yet Been Fully Completed</h3>
<p>The swap price fell along with the cooked gold. The January swap for February was pegged by Yingfengheng to Hengxing (short position) at one tael. However, this price was not easy to swap much, and there were many who were pegged. Only 35 bars were traded. The December swap to January was pegged out by Dadecheng, Tongfengheng, and Yingfengheng at five and a half cents, swapping to Hengxing for five or six hundred bars. The December swap to February was pegged out by Dadecheng and Yingfengheng at 1.6 cents, and Hengxing pegged in. In the afternoon, the swap was only done from December to January, which was pegged by Tongfengheng and Dadecheng to Hengxing at 6.5 cents. In short, the multi-party pegged out in January for February, which was really due to the large number of spot goods that had been arriving from Dalian and other places recently. As for those who have not yet settled, there are more than 3,000 bars. The multi-party is mostly Fuchang, Yuanheng, and Hengxing, etc., and the shorts are mostly Tongfengheng, Qianchangxiang, Dafengheng, and Hengyu, etc. It is heard that the bars that Hengxing has pegged in recently must be delivered to (Tongfengheng, etc.) the Central Bank.</p>

<h3>The Interest Rate Split Was in a State of Stagnation</h3>
<p>In the final week of the year, commercial practice dictates that most businesses engage in the year-end clearing and closing of accounts. Yesterday was also the beginning of the week, making the situation even more complex. This trend will likely worsen in the coming weeks. As for the use of foreign funds, business closures will inevitably lead to leisure, so the inflow and outflow of silver dollars have been constantly inconsistent in recent days. With fewer sources of income, the "stomach" is not as large as it used to be.</p>
<h3>The Interest Rate Split Had Slight Differences at the Same Price</h3>
<p>[Silver Interest Rate] In the early and noon markets, with no competition, the two markets had the same price, at 7 cents 1 fen 3 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half, slightly smaller by 1 hao 2 xu and a half compared to the previous day's noon market.

In the noon market, it was 6 qian 2 fen 2 li 3 hao 7 hu and a half. As a result, both kinds of jiao silver coins were slightly stronger. The transaction volume was 95,000 jiao in the early market and 30,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were slightly longer by 300 wen, at 396 strings of wen.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow Were Slightly Busy and Idle</h3>
<p>[Silver Funds] Yesterday was Monday, and with the noon customs closing soon, banks were closing and releasing funds. It was especially busy.

<h3>Last Week's Silver Reserves in Bombay Decreased Slightly</h3>
<p>Bombay telegram on the 17th: Mao Wenqi Company silver market report. The silver market last week was unchanged due to calm international news. Silver reserves are seeing a decrease. On the one hand, the arrival of goods from the interior is slack. On the other hand, the use of roads has slightly increased. The closing price last week was relatively stable, but the market was not very active. It is now expected that 11,500 bars of silver will be added to the reserves after December 19th. The average daily use of silver in the interior last week was 55 bars, an increase of 10 bars per day compared to the previous week. 40,000 pounds of silver shipped from London last week was the same as the previous week. There were no silver shipments on the way.</p>
<h3>German National Bank Note Statistics</h3>

<p>[P Financial Short-Term Three Consecutive Limit-Up Auctions&gt;</p>
<p>Other small denominations around half a yuan show a stable trend. Market conditions are quiet, with trading volume only around 5 million. Yesterday (the 19th), the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange saw very little spot trading, opening at 8,000 yuan. The futures market also suddenly became quiet. The morning session had just over 3.1 million, while the afternoon session only had over 1.8 million. Major players are generally taking a wait-and-see approach as the end of the year approaches. Although all prices are generally trending downwards, the fluctuations are moderate. Prices of items such as Consolidated Salt Tax are only fluctuating around half a yuan, down an average of two to three jiao to six to seven jiao compared to last week. However, there is still a significant change in the 20-year financial short-term bonds. The first lot immediately rose to 62 yuan and was suspended from auction, a rise of 4 yuan compared to the end of last week. This significant change is truly surprising.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Mixed</h3>
<p>A report from the New Asia Foreign Firm states that on Saturday last week (the 17th), the New York stock market was initially strong at the open, but then due to the favorable outlook on the beer case, Coca-Cola was hit, and the market situation weakened again. The number of railway cars totaled 521,216, a decrease of 26,245 from the previous week. The half-day trading volume totaled 414,000 shares. Looking at the current stock market, the situation may not undergo significant changes for the time being, as the stakes in various political and commercial issues are still difficult to estimate. On the one hand, investors will not easily sell, and on the other hand, due to the unstable political situation and the lack of significant progress in industry and commerce, they are also unwilling to buy in large quantities. Therefore, it is expected that the current stock market will not undergo major changes. The closing prices for the 17th are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 60.11 Down 0.41</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 27.59 Down 0.11</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 28.10 Up 0.10</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Sales Suddenly Decline</h3>
<p>Rumors of Telegrams from Yunnan and Guangdong Banning Shipments</p>
<p>The yarn market has suddenly fallen, and the situation is turning soft. Actual demand is increasingly stagnant. There are rumors of telegrams from Guangdong and Yunnan banning shipments, and reports state that the Japanese army's shelling in Jehol is severe, leading to public discouragement. However, ordinary retail investors still have a strong desire to go long.</p>
<h3>Cotton Standard Drops by One Liang, Five or Six Qian</h3>
<p>The cotton standard market opened strong in the morning, following the price of foreign cotton. Unexpectedly, there was a sudden drop in the second and third sessions, causing market panic. Due to the sluggishness and lack of activity in the spot yarn business, prices for all months fell by one liang to one liang, one, two, three, and four qian. The market continued to weaken in the afternoon, with prices for all months falling by two, three, four, and five qian. The total trading volume for the day was 51,300 bales. It was found that Lai sold 1,700 bales from Meiji, 1,100 bales from Xiesheng, 900 bales from Zhenda, 800 bales from Senkang, and 1,050 bales from Tongfu, while Jifeng bought 1,100 bales, Gengfeng bought 1,550 bales, Changyu bought 1,300 bales, Yichang bought 1,050 bales, and Lichang bought 900 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>February 1450 1853,250 Total 255,900</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Drops by Five Qian to One Liang</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales suddenly declined, and prices fell by five qian to one liang. Total purchases by various gangs for the day were 555 bales (there were also 1,000 bales of standard yarn opened by Yichang, a peer, for hedging). Shenxin Factory opened 1,080 bales of futures and spot yarn, and Dafeng Factory opened 50 bales of balloon yarn. The purchase amounts for each gang are listed below:</p>
<p>Hankou 100 Ningbo 18 Changsha 60 Xuzhou 20</p>
<p>Xiamen 1 Guangdong 10 Inland 57 Luzhou 5</p>
<p>Wuhu 20 Peers 1060 Jiangxi 100</p>
<h3>Cotton Drops Six and a Half Qian This Month</h3>
<p>The cotton market has plummeted, but the market sentiment is still strong, as most cotton merchants are inclined to buy in because: 1) domestic production is not abundant; 2) sources from all regions are depleted, and inventories are too low; 3) the recent situation of American cotton is relatively stable; 4) the amount thrown out by a certain manufacturer this month is too large, and the delivery of goods each month is particularly lacking. Due to these factors, speculators are vying to buy in, and the desire to go long is quite strong. Therefore, the market is more expensive than the yarn market. It is said that a certain manufacturer is searching for and shipping large quantities of cotton from Tianjin and Shandong to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Retail Investors Close Positions</h3>
<p>The Zheng Standard market opened strong in the morning, with tight conditions due to the short squeeze in the current month. Retail investors were unable to cover their positions, and prices for distant months fell slightly. In the second session, the price for the current month fell sharply. There were many rumors in the market that a certain manufacturer had purchased about 4,000 pieces of coarse cotton in Tianjin, Shandong, and other places and shipped them to Shanghai. Therefore, retail investors closed their positions, and the market plummeted like a bolt from the blue, suddenly falling five and a half qian and breaking through the three liang mark. However, buyers for distant months remained firm and did not let go (there is also a rumor that several brokerage firms purchased a huge amount of 70,000 dan on behalf of a certain foreign firm). Therefore, the bullish side became more and more assertive, with near-term prices falling four and a half to six qian and distant-term prices falling one and a half to two qian. In the afternoon, the price for the current month fell by five fen, the price for the middle month rose by five fen, and the price for the distant month remained unchanged. The total trading volume for the day was 173,300 dan. It was found that Lai sold 14,600 dan from Yuanxingchang, 2,800 dan from Tonghe, 4,200 dan from Shenchang, 2,300 dan from Rongxing, 3,300 dan from Dafeng, and 3,200 dan from Gengfeng, while Shenxinchun bought 7,200 dan, Gengfeng bought 13,500 dan, Ruida bought 4,100 dan, Yuanda bought 7,200 dan, Weihe bought 4,700 dan, Changfeng bought 3,700 dan, and Jifeng bought 3,400 dan. The market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance 33,340 Down 3025,900</p>

<h3>Statistics on Sales of Japanese Cotton Yarn in Shanghai in November</h3>
<p>Sales of cotton yarn by Japanese yarn mills in Shanghai were very strong in November, with a total of over 35,700 bales sold, an increase of 16,449 bales compared to October. This is the reason for the reduction in inventories. The sales volume in various regions is recorded below:</p>
<p>Location Bale Amount Location Bale Amount</p>
<p>Dalian 2,055 bales Nanyang 700 bales</p>
<p>Tianjin 7,252 bales Japan 1,865 bales</p>

<h3>Indian and British Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>(Bombay) Market conditions remained tight and stable last week due to short covering. Japanese merchants are improving Balarusi cotton to replace Oomra. The east was quiet until recently when a well-known Japanese merchant suddenly became active. Arrivals are delayed, and the amount of cotton thrown on the market is insufficient. In addition, the gold earned from sales in Upper India can prevent cotton farmers from rushing to sell their cotton. Therefore, market conditions can continue to be strong. Spot demand has improved slightly. Local factories are urgently purchasing for immediate use. The weekly statistics are appended below (units in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1951 1952</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts from September 1st 2,583 16</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 358 496</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports from September 1st 322 278</p>
<p>Exports to Europe 6196</p>
<p>Exports to China 981</p>
<p>Exports to Japan 146 177</p>
<p>Other Regions 175</p>
<p>(Liverpool) Spot sales were good last week. Futures were entirely dominated by global economic difficulties. However, in terms of business, except for the rise in silver prices, which caused slight speculation, all transactions were inter-dealer trades. The amount of short covering, purchases of new cotton by the Bombay gang, and purchases by peers had no impact and instead tended to increase prices. Egyptian cotton became more active, and all sales were absorbed by peers.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Surge Due to Heavy Cash Withdrawals by Various Gangs This Month</h3>
<p>丨Australian Wheat Set for Four Vessels, Canadian Wheat for Two Batches丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was driven up by the Dalian gang's search for cash after the market opened in the morning. Subsequently, various factories and firms, as well as factories in Shanghai and other places, set prices for four vessels of Australian wheat and two batches of Canadian wheat. (Australian wheat for January delivery was priced at 3 liang, 4 qian, 3 fen, and a half, and then at 3 liang, 4 qian, and a half. April delivery was priced at 3 liang and 4 qian. Canadian wheat, No. 3 for near-term delivery, was priced at 3 liang, 4 qian, and 7 fen and a half, and No. 2 for distant-term delivery was priced at 3 liang, 4 qian, and 8 fen.) The market only then returned to normal. However, due to the heavy cash withdrawals of flour by various gangs this month, the market continued to rise. The red cash withdrawals by Fufeng and small-to-medium-sized factories have reached 2 liang and 1 fen and around 2 liang, respectively. Fuxin is short of cash and is offering 50,000 bags for delivery in three weeks, priced at 1 liang, 9 qian, 7 fen, and a half net. Therefore, public sentiment and market conditions are good. The closing price for this month continued to rise by 1 fen and a half. Prices for January and beyond initially rose and then leveled off, with the closing price for January up 2.5 fen, February and March up 5 li, and April and May up 2.5 li.</p>
<h3>Merchants Still Actively Hoarding Early Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was a lack of rice on the market, and early rice was very popular because merchants were very active in hoarding it and continued to buy Jiangxi machine-milled late rice. Yesterday, they also resumed buying Hunan machine-milled oil rice. Both the Quanzhou and Fuzhou routes of the Fujian gang were also very interested. The North China gang had some dealings, but the merchants were most active in hoarding it, and the market looked good, with prices rising by about one jiao. Over 5,000 bags were offered on the market, and merchants bought more than half of them. Most of the early rice was sold to Fujian province, with little going to North China. It is estimated that 1,500 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice were offered, priced at 8 yuan and 6 jiao to 8 yuan and 2 jiao, as well as 50 bags of machine-milled red rice, priced at 7 yuan and 9 jiao and a half. 2,300 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice were offered, priced at 8 yuan and 7 jiao and a half to 6 jiao, as well as 1,300 bags of machine-milled red rice, priced at 8 yuan and 1 jiao and a half to 7 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, and 200 bags of polished red rice, priced at 8 yuan and 9 jiao to 8 jiao and a half, and 40 bags of polished Jing rice, priced at 7 yuan and 1 jiao.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>On Saturday last week (the 17th), Chicago wheat initially fell due to sales from the East, but then rose due to the strength of Winnipeg wheat. The trading volume on the 16th totaled 30 million bushels. The market prices for the 17th are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>December Futures 44.750 Up 0.500</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Over Two Thousand Bags of Raw and Red Sugar Offered</h3>
<p>丨Price at Thirteen Liang and a Half丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw little fluctuation in the standard gold price, and the trend gradually stabilized. The Guild set the price of No. 24 coarse white sand high-grade goods at 15 liang, 5 qian, 2 fen, and a half, and ordinary goods at 15 liang, 4 qian, 7 fen, and a half, with over 600 bags traded. No. 18 medium white sand and Nos. 89 and 90 Dutch red sugar remained unchanged. Xin Chaoqing (sugar) could not be uniformly priced by various firms, and as it was being replaced by new sugar, it was difficult to keep it off the market for long. Therefore, most of it has been offered on the market in recent days, priced at 9 liang and 1 qian to 8 liang and 3 qian, with fluctuations of four to five qian compared to the previous price. On the foreign firm side, Wah Shing offered over 2,000 bags of raw and red sugar, priced at 13 liang and a half. Jian Gang offered twenty to thirty boxes of standard Five Blessings white rock candy, priced at 11 liang per box, and miscellaneous brands were priced at 10 liang and 3 qian.

<h3>Dried Southern and Northern Goods: Longan Bubble Prices Decline</h3>
<p>There have been no recent shipments of large-bubble longans from Quanzhou. However, the previous shipments have already been mostly sold. Since last month, sales have been very sluggish. Therefore, various firms are taking a wait-and-see approach and have no intention of buying. The firms also have higher costs and are unwilling to sell at low prices. However, after a long period of being kept off the market, sales have not improved. Firms are now reducing prices on the previously high-priced goods to try to sell them. Therefore, the market situation is even more depressed. It was heard yesterday that some of the goods had already been sold off, with prices falling by about three liang compared to before. The remaining goods will also be sold off in the coming days. The market situation is unlikely to improve within the year, as inventories are too full.</p>
<h3>Hardware: New Iron Wire Has Arrived</h3>
<p>After the gangs in Wenzhou and Hankou bought large quantities of new iron wire, the market ran out of stock. There has been no news of it on the market for months. Yesterday, it was heard that Gonghexing has received 250 barrels of new goods, which were ordered by hardware stores along North Suzhou Road. Many deals have already been made with customers. The price for Nos. 16 to 20 is 13 liang per dan, and Nos. 21 to 25 are estimated at 13 liang and 7 qian and a half. It is said that over 50 barrels have been offered on the market.</p>
<h3>Steel Pricing Eased Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's news from foreign firms said that overseas steel prices have softened recently due to tighter foreign exchange rates. Steel products have fallen by half a pound per ton, and iron products have fallen by two to three shillings.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from London, black iron sheets (3X6 bundles of 13 sheets) are priced at £10 15s, galvanized iron sheets are priced at £10 per ton, tinplate (20 inches X 1420) of 112 sheets per hundred pounds is priced at 16 shillings and one and a half pence. Bismuth and antimony (Chinese) have risen slightly to £18 10s per ton.</p>

<h3>Lotus Ballad (1)</h3>
<p>— Mu Shiying</p>
<p>Drifting, like yellow leaves in autumn, over one mountain after another, one river after another – we are two people.</p>
<p>Together with a pair of sandalwood clappers and a Chinese fiddle, we travel from this city to that city. In front of thatched cottages, in front of the black-lacquered gates of palaces, in the streets, in the examination halls, we sing the Lotus Ballad, begging for a copper, a cup of soup, a bowl of cold rice – we are two people.</p>
<p>Yes, we are two people, but she died yesterday.</p>
<p>It was twenty years ago, when my hair was as black as my pupils. The soldiers bombed my home. The family members died, ran away, no one knew where they went. I ran south alone, and I was really tired when I ran until evening, so I ran to the gazebo in front. It was there that I met her. She was inside, sitting on the ground crying, sobbing. I was still shy at that time, so I sat down a little further away. She secretly glanced at me, and her crying became softer. I thought to myself... I should comfort her. Why is this girl crying here alone?</p>
<p>"Don't cry, girl! What are you crying about?" I said to her from afar.</p>
<p>She didn't say anything and just cried, even louder. Wasn't this a mess? I didn't dare to speak any more. I looked outside the gazebo, not daring to look at her. It was getting dark, and a crescent moon was shining on the fields. Near and far, I couldn't find any fire. A dog was standing outside the gazebo, looking at me. I remember it was a black dog. We also had a black dog at home. Our ox was yellow, and there was also a black chicken with beautiful long feathers. I wanted to kill it for three years, but I couldn't bear to. We also had a tabby cat. My younger sister loved that cat very much, but my father hated it, saying it loved to steal food. But my mother loved my younger sister, and my father loved me. When the tabby cat stole something, my father wanted to chop off its head, but my younger sister held it tightly and wouldn't let go, so my father hit her. Whenever I heard her crying, he would hit me. As soon as I cried, my father and mother would start arguing. But where did my father go? Where did my mother and younger sister go? And what about that black dog, that yellow ox, that tabby cat? Where did they go?</p>
<p>As I thought about it, I also wanted to cry, but she had stopped crying at some point. I turned my head to look, and she quickly turned her head away, afraid of being embarrassed and not letting me see her face. So I looked at her from behind. She was eating something there, eating it quite sweetly. Gulp, I swallowed a mouthful of saliva, and it sounded like thunder in the middle of the night. She turned her head to look, and I don't know why I gulped down another mouthful of saliva. She chuckled. I was so embarrassed. She took out a something and held it out from afar. I couldn't care about being embarrassed, and I ran over with a red face to eat it. I also didn't dare to speak. After I finished eating, I watched her eat. She still had five. When she raised her head, I quickly turned my eyes to the side. But she gave me another one. My face was really red and hot.</p>
<p>"Thank you," I said.</p>
<p>After I finished eating, she gave me two more.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much," I said.</p>
<p>"Want more?"</p>
<p>How could I say that it wasn't enough? I said it was enough.</p>
<h3>General Han's Smile</h3>
<p>— Gao Ming</p>
<p>A while ago, we saw in the newspaper that in Linqu County, Shandong Province, there were bandit leaders Li Lechuan, Song Wangshi, and tailor Fu Baoqi, who called themselves the Heavenly Emperor, Earthly Emperor, and Human Emperor, and prepared to ascend the throne next March. They were caught by the authorities. It's not surprising for a Chinese person to harbor a bit of wishful thinking. The bigger hope is to win the two or three hundred thousand yuan jackpot with ten dollars in horse racing, and the smaller hope is to turn one copper coin into an orange or a candy figure. This is what we are used to seeing, and no one is surprised. Therefore, we don't want to blame Mr. Li Fu and Mrs. Song, but what interests us is what happened afterward.</p>
<p>It wasn't until yesterday that the newspaper gave us a report (see today's newspaper):</p>
<p>"Han Fuju interrogated the false Song Wangshi at 8 p.m. tonight in the provincial government office. Song Wangshi's confession was mostly gibberish, vaguely saying... Lord Han, please guarantee that I will be Emperor, and if not, cut me into eight pieces. Han Da didn't dare... Han pitied Mrs. Song Wang because she was stimulated and had a nervous breakdown, and ordered Li to go home and be at peace, and advised others not to believe in Christianity. Li Lechuan and Fu Baoqi, Zhi Huaqing, were released at the same time, along with the divine ox, the divine building, and the imperial carriage. (Jinan Special Dispatch, 18th)"</p>
<p>Mrs. Song and Mr. Li Fu were so carefully cared for by General Han this time, which surprised us, but what we want to study now is General Han's smile.</p>
<p>According to experts, there are seven types of smiles:</p>
<p>1. Physiological smiles, such as tickle-induced smiles, and the silly smiles of babies; 2. Sad smiles; 3. Angry smiles; 4. Sick smiles, the hysterical laughter of the mentally ill; 5. Humorous smiles; 6. Deceptive smiles; 7. Joyful smiles.</p>
<p>We don't know what kind of smile General Han's smile is.</p>
<h3>The Sanxian Player</h3>
<p>— Jiang Tianwei</p>
<p>It's late at night. The street is pitch black. There are no streetlights and no pedestrians. Three or five stars flicker with faint light in the sky. It’s a narrow street, and the shops on both sides are like two walls. The street is full of filth, forever permeated with a kind of stench.</p>
<p>In this late night, every day I hear a sanxian player, playing the sanxian, slowly walking from one end of the street to the other. On this long street, he always walks back and forth. The sound of the sanxian is always sadly echoing.</p>
<p>This sanxian player has been playing back and forth on the street seven times already. From his sanxian, I know that he is anxious, and a kind of resentful emotion controls the movement of his hands. First, he plays a happy tune, like a carefree person, with laughter in the sound, like wanton tears. Then, he plays a melancholy tune, dull, desolate, like the weeping of a widow. At this time, he has already passed this street for the fourth time.</p>
<p>The night is getting deeper, but he is still playing the sanxian, slowly walking across the street. On the three strings, he is telling of his resentment, the sadness of his life, the lack of compassion in the world. The sound is like a rushing stream in the mountains, the tears of the waves in the sea, the low weeping of a widow in the late night, the groaning of wounded soldiers on the battlefield.</p>
<p>I listened quietly, feeling that the sanxian player's heart was deeply carved with the marks of life's suffering. He must truly understand the world. The sound of the sanxian came from afar again. I couldn't help but open the door, walk to the street, and invite the sanxian player into my living room. He was blind, his face full of wind and dust, reflecting a sad shadow. He was playing day and night. I asked him with a sympathetic tone:</p>
<p>"Don't you feel lonely playing like this in the late night?"</p>
<p>"Lonely! Sir! We blind people don't know what loneliness is."</p>
<p>"The sound of your sanxian tells me... Alas! I sympathize with you!"</p>
<p>"Sympathize with me! Sir! Thank you! Although we are said to be blind, I am a wanderer who plays three strings. I have tasted the bitterness of wind and rain, the terror of having no food or drink and running out of food. I am... but I don't forget that I play the sanxian. This is my life..."</p>
<p>"I think you can get the sympathy of people, right!"</p>
<p>"I don't want sympathy. I play the sanxian and walk through the streets and alleys. Ruthless children throw stones at me, arrogant dogs bite me."</p>
<p>Many people spit on me, laugh at me, and tease me. Where is the sympathy? I don't want it! I play the sanxian, telling of the injustices of the world."</p>
<p>"......"</p>
<p>The sanxian player heard that I was silent, so he plucked the sanxian, a few low sounds, gradually getting higher. An oil lamp in the living room radiated a dim light, and the sound of the sanxian trembled.</p>
<p>I couldn't stand it any longer. The sound of this desolate sanxian broke my heart. I gently stuffed fifty copper coins into his hand. He stopped playing the sanxian in surprise, and seemed to say with emotion:</p>
<p>"I haven't told your fortune, sir, but I'm receiving your money. I shouldn't. I can't receive this..."</p>
<p>"................"</p>
<p>"I can't! If I receive this kind of alms, the sanxian will break. Alas! I can't!"</p>
<p>What could I say? As expected, the sanxian player did not accept this extra kindness from me. He seemed to be frightened.</p>
<p>The next night, I didn't hear the sound of the sanxian trembling in the street. I thought he was sick. I didn't hear it the third night either. The fourth day, the fifth day... it was gone forever. Where did this sanxian player go?</p>
<p>I regret it very much. My compassionate heart has driven the blind man on an even longer journey.</p>
<p>My heart will forever remember the sanxian player.</p>
<h3>My Cherished Younger Sister</h3>
<p>— Ms. Biyao</p>
<p>3.  Ailing Fallen Blossom</p>
<p>Luo Ying grew up by the lakeside of Taihu, with bright eyes and pearly teeth, lively and graceful. As for her writing, it was even more enchanting and delicate, with twists, turns, and youthful beauty. From Hangzhou to Shanghai, after several years of schooling, she completed the prototype of a modern woman; in thought and deed, she could liberate herself. Once, she was disgusted with the school she was in, and deliberately, on that week's life report card, wrote that the most unsatisfactory thing this week was the breaking of her hymen. This paper was handed to the training department, causing a great uproar, and she was immediately expelled. In fact, at that time, she knew nothing except for some gender knowledge taught by the physiology teacher in class. However, she hated those hypocritical male teachers who pretended to be monks and nuns on the surface, but secretly were not to be questioned, so she deliberately made a joke. Later, she applied to a school, and because her paper was outstanding, the result of the first written test ranked her at the top. However, in the second oral test, a single female teacher saw that she was too lively, and asked her if she had a boyfriend. She immediately replied that she did. Then she asked her where her boyfriend was now? (The meaning was that if he was far away, it wouldn't be too important). She replied that she had more than one boyfriend, and they were everywhere. The female teacher was so stunned that she couldn't ask any more questions, just stared at her blankly for a long time, waved her hand and told her to leave; so she failed the exam. At a speech competition at a university in Shanghai, she met a young man. She immediately wrote him a letter, pursued him, and automatically developed all aspects of love. Sometimes on Sundays, when she returned to school from outside, friends asked her where she came from, and she honestly said she came from a hotel. If anyone sneered, she would scold them for being vulgar. Her [life] was not vulgar at all. All hypocritical, apprehensive, timid, and rigid words and deeds were completely absent. With her bold and outstanding spirit, she could create, fight, and inspire the cowardly and warn the stubborn. Unfortunately, her life in the last two years was too irregular, indulging in excessive drinking and eating, and unrestrained pleasure. On the one hand, she contracted a lung disease from her lover, and on the other hand, she suffered a loss of vitality due to a careless abortion. Recently, she has become emaciated and has been abandoned by her admirers, lying alone in illness in a foreign land. That haggard face is unrecognizable. Her studies have been interrupted, and it is unknown how long her life can last. All her friends sigh when they talk about her.</p>
<h3>New Scientific Weapons (2)</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The second terrible weapon is the electric cannon. This cannon does not use gunpowder, but completely uses the power of electricity to launch projectiles. It was invented by the Frenchman Fuxiong Bipler in 1916. Originally, the impact distance of a cannon was directly proportional to the speed of the projectile when it flew out of the muzzle; now, it can launch a one-hundred-kilogram projectile at a speed of 4,000 meters per second, with an impact distance of eight hundred kilometers.</p>
<p>If this becomes a reality, then in the next world war, France's enemies can safely bombard Paris from distant rear positions. Previously, the German army's self-proclaimed unparalleled Bertha gun had a range of only one hundred and twenty kilometers, which is nothing compared to the power of the electric cannon. Although the manufacturing cost of electric cannons is very high, in theory and in practice, their performance is very good; however, further research is still needed, and when they can be practically applied, they will not appear on the battlefield. Sitting in Paris, you can use cannons to bombard Berlin, London, and Rome. This may not necessarily be a futuristic dream of the twenty-first century, and may appear in the near future.</p>

<h3>Crossroads of the Era and Love 20</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Which side should I go to? Which side is more important? The Ren family's appointment cannot be changed. Should I ask Yaoxing to change the date? Earlier or later would be fine, as long as it's not the afternoon of the 5th.]</p>
<p>He felt that no matter what, he couldn't sacrifice the Ren family's dinner. This wasn't just about the dinner itself, but he wanted to see Ms. Liu Peizhen, Mrs. Ren, who had given him a very good impression since their meeting that day.</p>
<p>Using the index number of the north series, subtract one screen from the original index, which is the differential of the variable.</p>
<p>Professor Wang's old tune was playing again. Haiquan thought that this teacher's teaching method was really not clever. He had no intention of listening to Mr. Wang's lecture, just hoping for the bell to ring and end the class quickly.</p>
<p>He suddenly thought of Mrs. Tsuruko. From Mrs. Tsuruko, he imagined the intimate scene between that Japanese guy and Mrs. Tsuruko. A wave of depression arose again in his mind.</p>
<p>[What's there to be afraid of! I still have a wad of paper in my pocket.]</p>
<p>He reached into his pocket to feel the wad of paper, comforting himself, wanting to take it out and look at it, but worried that the classmate Zhu sitting behind him would peek.</p>
<p>He finally endured four hours, and the clock struck twelve. In the afternoon, there was only one hour of military training, and he was unwilling to stay in this dry and tasteless school any longer.</p>
<p>Subjectively, he really didn't want to go back to the public residence, but the objective environment forced him to take that road.</p>
<p>Sitting on the tram, he unfolded the wad of paper that Ms. Zhuo had tossed him.</p>
<p>[Haiquan, my home address is No. 15, Lane S, H Road, North Sichuan Road. I have important matters to discuss with you. Please come to my residence around 8 o'clock tonight. Please do not refuse.]</p>
<p>He really couldn't figure out why Zhuo Shuhua wanted him to go to her house. He just thought, I'll go see her. Returning to the entrance of the Zeng Public Residence, he listened intently to the temple side, it was quiet and still, without any sound. He had expected Mrs. Tsuruko to be standing at the entrance to welcome him. But looking at the current situation, he was disappointed. He pushed the back door hard, and there was no [lock] inside. The door opened at his push. The maid heard the sound and walked out of the front parlor rubbing her eyes.</p>
<p>[Mr. Lin, you're back so early?]</p>
<p>[Where is the young mistress?]</p>
<p>Haiquan couldn't help but ask her this.</p>
<p>[She went out with that Japanese gentleman this morning.]</p>
<p>[Just the two of them?]</p>
<p>[And that beautiful Japanese girl.]</p>
<p>Hearing the maid's words, Haiquan thought of the beautiful Japanese girl about fifteen or sixteen years old he saw standing behind Mrs. Tsuruko this morning.</p>
<p>[Mr. Lin hasn't eaten yet, has he? The young mistress prepared Mr. Lin's snacks before she went out.] After hearing this, Haiquan secretly thanked Mrs. Tsuruko in his heart. He returned to his room on the third floor and sat for a while, then the maid brought him a large bowl of mushroom and chicken noodles to eat.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Dotting and Circling</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Recently, the Random Thoughts section of this publication has abandoned the new punctuation and has actually started using dotting and circling. Dotting and circling was a favorite trick of essayists in the past, used for things like "great opening and great closure" or "vigorous and unrestrained," using large circles for emphasis. Now, these fart-like Random Thoughts (it should be stated here that this refers to my own Random Thoughts; other people's Random Thoughts are the exception), what is there to circle? It's truly a performance of Shen Bao's sixty-year-old virgin. Her attitude, trying to appear charming and beautiful, adorned with jewels and jade, with three-inch golden lilies and embroidered sleeves. ["Having seen thousands of women, I've never seen such a delightful maiden before,"] but ultimately it lacks contemporaneity. The general feudal coloration feels too strong, and it definitely cannot compete with several ["modern misses"]. Truly, Random Thoughts will not compete with several modern misses in long cheongsams and short overcoats. Nor dare it compete with modern misses; adding some dotting and circling is just a curious concept of ["not discarding what I take"] and ["waste utilization"]. ["A leper's son looks good to his own eyes,"] I am also human, and naturally cannot escape this common mentality. Therefore, even if anyone scolds my writing as extremely bad or incomprehensible, although I dare not be presumptuous, belittle myself, or willingly submit, I will also never ["value my worn-out broom as if it were gold"] or self-importantly ["recite with three sighs"] or slap the table and shout "bravo." Nor will I dare to boast about myself, claiming to be some ancient writer or some new literary figure, or that my work is earth-shatteringly amazing.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Leng once said that writing articles is like excreting waste; after excreting, one should never turn back to look at it, whether it is hard or soft, fragrant or foul. I share the same principle with Mr. Chen; no matter how bad or ugly the fart I release, I will never turn back to look at it. But a pockmarked girl insists on applying rouge and powder, trying to cover up her embroidered face. This is also the common nature of pockmarked girls; hence Yingchuan Chen An once wrote a poem saying, ["Heaven pities her for not being beautiful, and adorns her face with makeup."] But even so, it is nothing more than a theory of glossing over and disguising flaws. This publication's addition of some dotting and circling may also be the intention of a pockmarked young lady to be coy and affected; this is what I dare to admit.</p>
<p>To change the subject, but driving backward is not a good business strategy; for example, a person should always walk forward on a bright road, never turn backward, and become a straggler of the times. Truly, who wants to drive backward, who wants to be a straggler? Indeed, he is an idiot, a fool. But try to open your eyes and look; from the government to society, from the warlords to the police officers standing at the gate, from important people to the "tossing the crown" of the little [third brothers], where doesn't one find examples of driving backward and turning backward? For example, in weddings, there are small ancestral shrines and magnificent military bands, inside there is a high-hanging flag of the party and the nation, and outside there is a pair of ancestral shrine lanterns raised high. These are all common contradictory tricks; what does it matter if we add some dotting and circling?</p>
<p>Moreover, is adding dotting and circling really being a straggler? Is not adding dotting and circling really being modern? Are evolution and regression, outdatedness and modernity, really only distinguished by dotting and circling? If this is truly the case, if it is indeed the case, if the distinction lies in this one point, then why wouldn't I happily hang up a sheep's head and sell dog meat, and pretend to be a modern brand? But the so-called new punctuation is nothing more than imitating Western punctuation. But Western punctuation, which we consider new, has long become outdated in Europe and America, and cannot be said to be an absolutely novel and delightful thing. Furthermore, whether [a seven-and-a-half-inch hat fits perfectly] is also a problem. Saying this any further would be too wordy; it's better to conclude quickly. In short, in modern matters, one cannot thoroughly investigate the roots. Whether it's modern or outdated, just be so-so.</p>

<h3>Method of Making Cotton from Straw</h3>
<p>— Yiheng</p>
<p>Cotton is a necessity in the world, naturally produced. Today, in civilized countries around the world, there are people who make it artificially. The raw materials used are discarded by farmers, such as rice straw or mulberry bark, which can all be used for manufacturing. Furthermore, it does not require a large capital investment. The equipment used is available in every household, such as (pots, sieves, buckets, boxes, etc.). The chemical materials used are available in pharmacies and art supply stores everywhere. Now, the method of making cotton from rice straw is described below.</p>
<p>Rice straw: One hundred catties (referring to the clean ones)</p>
<p>Caustic soda (i.e., lye): Nine catties and four ounces</p>
<p>Sulfuric acid (i.e., strong sulfuric acid): One catty, seven maces, and two fen (divided into two applications)</p>
<p>Bleaching powder: Twelve catties and four ounces</p>
<p>(1) First, remove the weeds from the rice straw, use a knife to cut off the roots and ears, peel off the leaves, and cut the middle section into pieces about two or three inches long, preparing them for use. It does not matter whether it is glutinous or non-glutinous rice straw, all can be used. However, it is best to use fresh, white, and tender rice straw from the current year. Old or moldy rice straw must not be used.</p>
<p>(2) Put clean water into a pot and boil it. Add caustic soda (Sodium hydroxide) to the water. After it dissolves, slowly add the rice straw, stir well with a stick, and boil until it is soft.</p>
<p>(3) Scoop out the boiled rice straw, put it in a leaky bamboo basket, rinse with clean water. If there are any undissolved pieces, pick them out and mash them. Put them back in clean water, pick out the moldy grass and grass nodes, and squeeze them dry.</p>
<p>(4) Put cold water in a vat, pour in sulfuric acid (Sulfuric Acid), six ounces and eight fen, to form dilute sulfuric acid, put the straw floss in, soak for a quarter of an hour, take it out, squeeze it dry, and pull it loose.</p>
<p>(5) Dissolve bleaching powder (Bleaching Powder) in clean water, remove the lime, then heat water and stir evenly. Immediately put the squeezed-dry straw floss in, stir evenly with a wooden stick, cover it for a whole day and night, and it will become white grass cotton (Note) If the bleaching lime is not removed, it will not become cotton.</p>
<p>(6) Pour sulfuric acid, ten ounces and six maces and four fen, into a vat of clean water to form extremely dilute sulfuric acid. Wash the bleached straw floss with clean water once, squeeze it dry, put it in sulfuric acid, stir evenly, leave it exposed for one hour to remove the bleach odor, then wash it with clean water, squeeze it dry, put it in the sun, dry it to 70%, pull it apart, and dry it to 100%. It can be fluffed to become clean white cotton.</p>
<h3>A Tragic and Stirring Letter</h3>
<p>My dearest sister Min;</p>
<p>When I wrote this letter, I didn't want to tell you, but if I don't tell you, I won't have another day to</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Supplement to the Local News of Shen Bao</p>
<p>say anything! Besides, you will eventually find out sooner or later, so I should tell you!</p>
<p>Since the day I left you at the train station, my heart was filled with the sadness of separation, but when I thought that it was for the honor of the nation and the survival of the country, I felt happy in my heart!</p>
<p>Our volunteer army has been developing in the Northeast! When we arrived at General Ma's command, they were very welcome because we had all received considerable training in school, so a part of us was immediately assigned to the rear defense for security, and another part went to the front line!</p>
<p>At that time, I was also assigned to a team on the front line. When we were about to face the battle, the continuous sound of guns whizzed into our ears. Although we were all young people who had not experienced battle, our blood was boiling, and we did not feel any fear. We just looked around very sharply, preparing for the arrival of the dwarfs!</p>
<p>Early the next morning, the commander of the volunteer army ordered us to be especially careful and vigilant, because we heard that a part of the enemy had transferred from the town to our front. At the same time, they sent more than a dozen brothers with rich war experience to strengthen our defense line.</p>
<p>In the evening, scattered and chaotic gunshots, mixed with the rumbling cannons from behind, continued to fire. Sure enough, several tanks carrying dwarf soldiers rushed into our line. At that time, the commander ordered us to charge, and we bravely went up to resist. The dwarf soldiers all jumped out of the vehicles to fight us in close combat. Although I had been hit by several bullets in my leg, I did not feel it at all at that time. Our courage seemed to be even stronger! As a result, half of the dwarf soldiers died, and the rest mostly fled. However, many of our brothers also died. In this conflict, I also killed several dwarf soldiers, which was really enjoyable!</p>
<p>The enemy reinforced their troops in an instant, and many more came. At this time, our classmate Chen was killed by a dwarf soldier, which added a lot of anger. While we were chasing, there seemed to be planes circling in the sky. Then something fell near us. With a bang, I lost consciousness.</p>
<p>When I woke up, I was lying in the hospital bed, my body full of shrapnel wounds. Sister Min! My right leg was also blown off. The doctor told me to rest assured, I probably won't make it? I am going to die in the shortest amount of time, so I write this letter in pain. Perhaps when you see this letter, I have already left with a smile!</p>
<p>Oh, sister Min! You don't need to be sad for me, I died for the survival of the country and the honor of the nation.</p>
<p>I wish you happiness! My dearest sister Min!</p>
<p>Your loving Kun, written at the wounded soldiers' hospital</p>
<h3>The Farmer's Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>Since graduating, I have been running around in Shanghai and have not returned to my hometown. Currently, I have returned home for two days because of matters concerning the fields. Firewood and farm tools are piled up on the farmyard. The farmers have worked hard for a year, and this is when they can rest. Moreover, this year is also a year of good harvest. I imagined setting up a low table in the farmyard, with the whole family gathering around to eat dinner. Eating from sunset to dark. Perhaps this is their happiest time?</p>
<p>Our village completely preserves the simple customs of the past. For example, if someone has a wedding or funeral, the whole village comes to help, treating each other like family. On the evening I returned home, after dinner, the old man next door, as usual, held a water pipe and a particularly long paper tube, muttering in his mouth as he came to my house to chat. He is an old child. When I was in my hometown before, he would play tug-of-war and catch sparrows with us. Sometimes, he would even buy one or two copper coins' worth of sweets to chew on. Therefore, when I heard his footsteps, I stepped out of the door to invite him in.</p>
<p>The old man did not have the vigor of the past, nor did he have his usual smile. After sitting down in front of the kerosene lamp, he first sighed and suddenly asked me, "Did we lose a lot in this war with the Japanese?"</p>
<p>"Quite a bit. I heard it's several million yuan!"</p>
<p>"It's really not worth it. How can the Chinese beat the Japanese?" The old man said logically. "Young master, you don't know that they are going to build an airfield here. The people in this village are so scared that they have all moved away..." He shook his head and took a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>"The newspapers said it wasn't built!"</p>
<p>"Yes! But thousands of acres of fields here have been ruined! And people's graves have been overturned. Under the Qing Dynasty laws, digging up graves would be punishable by death."</p>
<p>"What will happen to so many fields?"</p>
<p>"Fortunately, the order to withdraw the project came early, and we have now harvested the grain."</p>
<p>"That's good. If we can have a good harvest, then don't worry about so much."</p>
<p>"Young master, the harvest is indeed good, but the price of rice is so cheap, and the landlords (i.e., the landowners) are unwilling to reduce the rent in kind. (It is a custom in the hometown that after the farmers sell the rice, they use the proceeds to pay the rent in kind to the landowners.) What can the people in the countryside do?"</p>
<p>"Old man, do you have your own fields to farm?"</p>
<p>"It's not good to have our own fields either. The grain tax increases year after year. If there is a famine year, what will we use to pay the grain!" He smoked as he spoke, and the particularly long paper tube had only a small section left that he could hold between his fingers. I knew he was about to get up and leave. As expected, he stood up and ended his speech. "It's not good to farm other people's fields, and it's not good to farm our own fields. It's really hard for the people in the countryside!"</p>
<p>A sad mood completely enveloped his wrinkled face.</p>

<h3>Writing a Letter to a Friend's Wife (Continued Eleven)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>These kinds of jokes, containing so much blood and tears, effortlessly increased the students' attention to the Zhou-Li romance. At the same time, both male and female students were worried about Dajing because the two of them were too different in personality, status, and environment. Dajing's strength was his knowledge, but knowledge was considered worthless by girls in the 19th century. Therefore, the prediction that Dajing would definitely be abandoned by Li Fang had already been definitively concluded by the students.</p>
<p>Dajing had also heard these predictions at that time, especially from me, who, as a good friend, tirelessly—this qualification remained until I met you on Seward Road, when it automatically disappeared—tried to dissuade him. However, he was deeply intoxicated by Li Fang's charming smiles, and naturally treated my words as a passing breeze.</p>
<p>Because he was so deeply infatuated, he was in such pain after the breakup that he felt as if he had lost his soul.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that the soul he lost three years ago would suddenly meet me head-on. But at this time, I was no longer Dajing's good friend, but a bad friend who almost stole his second soul.</p>
<p>[Where is Mr. Zhu working now?] Although I am a very talkative person, I was really not in good spirits that night, and for a long time, I couldn't think of a word to say to her. Instead, she was the first to ask me.</p>
<p>[Um! ...Me? I am...] Unexpectedly, her first question made me unable to answer. If she had asked me the day before, I could have easily told her that I was with Dafeng Foreign Firm; but now, I had resigned from Dafeng's job six hours ago. How could I say I was working there? I hesitated for a long time before making up a lie: [Teaching at University K.]</p>
<p>[Oh! Isn't the president of University K XXX? They originally wanted to invite our Mr. Ma last semester,] My unfounded lie actually opened her floodgates of words. [Because he was already the president of K College and knew that University K was a notoriously poor school, he didn't go. What subject are you teaching there? How long have you been teaching?]</p>
<p>[So, you are now Mrs. Ma Jichuan. My apologies!] I ignored her question and first made a note of the five words [our Mr. Ma] she had said.</p>
<p>She smiled very proudly. But in her pride, there seemed to be some pretense of modesty.</p>
<p>Dear little friend! Don't you always scold me for being the worst villain in the world? You mean it as a joke, but it's actually true! I am not only bad, but also good at guessing other people's thoughts. Li Fang's words and her kind of pretense of modesty turned around a few times in my mind, and I immediately understood the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>[Ma Jichuan's wife is Ms. Ouyang Jinming, who often stays at the YWCA. Li Fang has probably unfortunately become his concubine!] The report after the mind's work.</p>
<p>[Oh! Mrs. Ma! Forgive me, let me ask you a question.] I prepared to seize this opportunity that she presented and make fun of her, to vent some of Dajing's grievances. [When did Dr. Ma divorce Ms. Ouyang, who often works for the YWCA?]</p>
<p>This question really embarrassed her. She immediately lowered her head, pressed her bright red lips against the rim of the glass, and remained silent for a long time, unable to utter a sound. Her face gradually turned red, as if she were drunk.</p>
<p>Her embarrassment further confirmed my mind's report; I was extremely pleased, almost bursting out laughing.</p>
<p>After all, she was a socialite. Although she was caught off guard by my embarrassment, she gradually recovered her composure after five or six minutes. She first flashed her fluent eyes, containing a hint of resentment, at me a few times, and then smiled generously.</p>

<p>Rare News from the Film World</p>
<h3>Is Sun Bici a Comedian? (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fulun</p>
<p>Sun Bici's humor makes children clap their hands and laugh when they see her. This is indeed comparable to Chaplin. But whether Sun Su is a comedian is worth discussing. According to a famous director in Hollywood, [They all call Sun Bici to play comedic roles, but they don't know that one of the greatest tragic authors of the era has been buried.]</p>
<p>To know whether Sun Bici is a comedian or a tragedian, please first study her life. There are many things that many people do not know, and I will describe them below.</p>
<p>Sun Su first arrived in Hollywood more than thirteen or four years ago. At that time, she was as lonely as a kitten that had lost its mother; she knew that her appearance was not attractive; she also had no sexual appeal. Finding a job? That was not for Sun Su. She lived in a small club, watching many giggling and romantic female stars float back and forth, and felt the envy and longing in her heart burning like fire. People pitied her and wanted to be her friend, but she was afraid and dared not look up. But a kind Mr. Francis Marin eventually gave her some work to do, making her a supporting actress for Mary Pickford. This was the first act of Sun Bici's film career.</p>
<p>This was really a blessing in Sun Su's life, because from that day on, she knew that there were people in the world who truly appreciated her, and she no longer doubted herself. At that time, Hollywood held a dance party every Thursday night. Sun Su attended the dance party for the first time and met Tom Gallely. Tom chose this Ms. Bici from among hundreds of beautiful girls. He asked her to dance. He said she had sexual appeal. Later, Ms. Bici married this Mr. Gallely. They lived a happy family life for several years. Unfortunately, Gallely's mood changed, and Bici suffered so much grievance that she couldn't bear it and divorced.</p>
<p>Sun Bici is a natural tragedian. Her nature tends towards bitterness; her views are also bitter; and she likes to listen to bitter stories. Once, the Hollywood night court asked about the deeds of a violated woman, and Sun Bici actually sat and listened all night. She herself said that she liked to listen to this naked statement of life's tragic circumstances. She can deeply empathize with those who feel the bitterness of life and the hunger of the soul.</p>
<p>But Sun Su's treatment of people and kisses is extremely sweet. The people of Hollywood have been praising Sun Bici's kindness to people. When the famous actress Barbara La Marr died, leaving behind a lonely and helpless adopted daughter, Sun Bici was moved with compassion and took the orphan over, making her feel no difference between her former mother and her stepmother. This is one of the widely praised deeds in Hollywood. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>(1) Movie Actors Open Up New Avenues</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The sound film [Winning Glory for the Country] by Jinan Company, after filming the exterior scenes in Hangzhou, the interior scenes have invisibly stopped filming, supposedly because of a problem with the radio? This problem is also a money problem? So these actors wanted to find a way to make money during their spare time and organized a drama club for movie songs. Yesterday, they held a discussion meeting at the Central Film Trading Company and decided that the club would be called the "ISIS" [Oasis] Opera Society. It is said that singing star Li Lilian will participate, and Chen Dabei will write the script, Hu Xuguang will draw the scenery and design the stage set, the AClarins band, and eight dancers, Chen Gexin will guide the singing and score the music, Lu Fu and Gu Wenzong will direct, Wang Chunyuan and Chen Yitang will star, and Yangtianle will design the costumes, and Chen Baoqi will provide the lighting.</p>
<p>Today, Wang Naiding has already gone to Nanjing, Wuxi, and Suzhou to contact the theaters for the premiere. Shanghai will wait until the rehearsals are proficient before the premiere.</p>
<h3>(2) The Return of the [Four Infantrymen]</h3>
<p>— Muzhu</p>
<p>Shortly after the end of the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai, a famous German war film that called itself an opposition to [All Quiet on the Western Front] was shown at the Carlton Theatre. Its name, which you have probably not forgotten, is [Four Infantrymen]. At that time, because the 19th Route Army retreated due to lack of reinforcements, the Japanese soldiers occupied many places, and everyone was so depressed that they wanted to watch war films to vent their anger. As a result, [Four Infantrymen] was very popular. As the saying goes, the venue was full and it was a sensation for a while.</p>
<p>It is said that [Four Infantrymen] will be re-released in Shanghai. In my opinion, it is still worth seeing. Movie fans in Hongkou, why not come and see it.</p>

<h3>A Small History of Li Pingqian</h3>
<p>— Lu Yasheng</p>
<p>Li Pingqian is a modern directing star, who transferred from Tianyi to Mingxing Company. He has many works, which I won't go into detail about; what I want to say now, I remember it was about seven or eight years ago! At this time, he was still studying at Jiaxing Xiuzhou Middle School, and I? But I was in the same school with him, but not in the same grade.</p>
<p>When he was in school, he was not very smart in his studies, but he was lively by nature, liked to move, not to be quiet, and was very fond of drama. Therefore, he did not score very high in his studies. I remember one semester, he was dismissed from school by the school authorities for failing mathematics. But he? He was not distressed or resentful, so he ran to Shanghai, and eventually entered the film company, and only then did he get to where he is now. Therefore, I remember when I was studying, I often heard the teachers say that no matter what you do, you should try your best to do it, don't be afraid to do it, and that failure is the mother of success, indeed.</p>
<p>I am not here to destroy Mr. Li's reputation, but I really admire his courage and give us a lesson. Although I am also on the road to art now, I still hope that Mr. Li will walk to the forefront.</p>

<h3>The Face of the Screen (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Dunruo</p>
<p>Qion Hanais Philipo, a filmmaker on a subway trip, accidentally looked up from the newspaper and saw the woman sitting across from him, which made his fingers cold. The woman's name was A Mai Telijiya Ersiji, you can't guess her age, she looks like an incarnation of sorrow. Not only did the pale and dull hair around her thin and depressed face frighten him, but the countless wrinkles on her face, the knotted hands on her bag, the worn shoes, and the patched clothes all deeply stimulated him. However, what inspired him the most was the extreme dullness, lifelessness, and despair in her eyes. He closed his eyes for a while, trying to get rid of the image she gave him, but in this instant, a creative idea arose very enthusiastically in his thoughts.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a crowd scene in a new film he was making, called [The Call of the Abyss], poured into his mind. He saw a group of black figures like the woman in front of him rushing up the stairs, and then one of them—the one sitting across from him now—left them alone, walking sadly a short distance separated from the crowd and the stairs. This group of frantic women pushed up behind her. He opened his eyes and realized that he was in the subway. He walked towards the woman and said in a half-loud voice:</p>
<p>[Would you like to see a Mr. written on this card? I think he can give you a good job.] His words stopped for a while before penetrating her senses. She still didn't look up, and finally she asked. [Is it odd jobs?]</p>
<p>[No, it's a very good job with a high salary. They will tell you the details when you get there.] [You know I have a job, 70 cents an hour every day, but this position will be gone. The office is closing soon. I like to do odd jobs.] (To be continued)</p>
<p>The sound film [Flower of Freedom] by Mingxing Company was previewed at the Guanglu Grand Theatre last month, and there have been very good opinions in the newspapers. The picture below is a scene of Hu Die Xia Peizhen's jealousy and fight in [Flower of Freedom]. The film will be shown at the Nanjing Grand Theatre soon.</p>
<h3>Fairy Tale Film</h3>
<p>— Xiu Xi</p>
<p>[Flying Ambassador] (Air Mail Mystery) is a new product of Universal Company. The film is based on Western fairy tales and consists of twenty large volumes. These kinds of stories are almost exclusively for European and American children to watch. Therefore, the children in that country can tell you in detail! It is just like the children in our country, they can all tell fairy tales, [Flying Car], [Three Sisters], [Glass Shoes], etc., but, it is heard that the gentlemen of the Nanjing Film Inspection Committee have repeatedly re-examined it and still regard it as a suspicious case! In fact, fairy tales can be used by children for after-school entertainment, so the wise inspection gentlemen will definitely not regard the film as superstitious and absurd! Moreover, this kind of film is absolutely not absurd and preposterous! I think it will definitely pass in the shortest time, and at the same time, it can be used as entertainment for many children during Christmas! (Yet Reward)</p>
<h3>Correction of Chen Yumei's Nickname</h3>
<p>— Tianyi Contribution</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper reported that Chen Yumei's nickname was Bao Bao, which is actually incorrect. Her original surname was Fei, and her nickname was Mengmin. Her father was the late famous doctor Fei Chunfu, who was the master of the Menghe School. When she was five years old, after her father passed away, she moved to Fei's villa in Suzhou City to grow up, so she can only speak Wu dialect softly. Later, she came to Shanghai at the age of fourteen and entered the film industry. People call her Bao Bao because of her young age, but it is not her nickname. At the age of sixteen, she transferred to Tianyi Company. At that time, Hu Die starred in the Pearl Tower film at Tianyi. She entered Tianyi to star in the Three Smiles film. The two films were completed one after another, and the business was better than other films. Therefore, their reputation gradually became known in the film industry. (Yet Reward)</p>

<h3>Conquering Yourself</h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>Plato once said, [The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself; the person who is conquered by himself is the most shameful and base thing of all.]</p>
<p>I don't know if Plato has ever practiced performing arts or seen the process of training expressions. If he himself cannot express himself, then this sentence also includes himself. If he cannot be controlled by the environment and laugh when he wants to laugh and cry when he wants to cry, he himself is a person conquered by himself.</p>
<p>I have said repeatedly above that those who study performing arts should train the muscles of their faces to operate freely like drivers. To those who have no experience in the photography field, this is just a very plain and unremarkable sentence. Only after he tries it in front of the mirror will he know the value of this training. What is expression training? It is what Pala calls [Conquering yourself.]</p>
<p>If the muscles on your face are unwilling to be controlled by your will, the work of conquering yourself cannot be considered complete. For this reason, whether you want to make acting a career or not, you should use the time when you look at your face in the mirror to practice facial expressions. This is the last and most important work to complete your [Conquering yourself]. Except for those who intend to be hermits, facial expressions are something everyone should [learn and practice from time to time]. If the muscles on your face are not controlled by your mind, you will unknowingly suffer great losses! When you are talking, your heart is trying its best to express sincerity to the other party, but unfortunately your eyes are wandering there, showing a hesitant and doubtful attitude. What impression do you think the other party will have?</p>
