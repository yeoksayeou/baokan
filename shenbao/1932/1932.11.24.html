<h3>國聯特會下月初可望召集</h3>
<p>日代表準備投票反對</p>
<p>但三分二同意即生效</p>
<p>行政會議昨日重開</p>
<p>松岡洋右續逞狡辯</p>
<p>國聯行政院昨日午後三時半開會、日代表松岡繼續發表演説、對於我國顧維鈞駁斥之語有所辯護、至我國代表是否再加駁斥、聞此時猶未决定、此外行政院料將徵詢國聯調查團主席李頓對於中日雙方對報告書之意見、及兩代表之演説有無意見發表、但逆料此亦不過形式問題、諒李頓勛爵定將聲稱中日雙方所爭辯者調查團在遠東時早已飫聞、故目下堅持報告書中主張也、</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政院明日午後三時半開會、其議程第一條、即爲中日爭議、日代表松岡將爲唯一之發言人、松岡現已列名於議程中矣、第二條爲里比利亞事、第三條爲但澤之波蘭通幣問題、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（南京）國聯行政院二十三日下午三時半重行開會、正式討論李頓報告、預定程序首由李頓爵士致詞、答覆日意見書、並重申調查團不能承認所謂「滿洲國」、及日本承認「滿洲國」係屬無理繼由各國代表相繼質疑訊問、並詢問日政府對中日爭端是否有和平解决之意、至會議詳情、因南京時間較日内瓦遲八小時、故行政院開會時、南京時間已是十一時半、如開會二小時、則會議情形至早須至二十四日晨二三時始能抵京、（二十三日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）外交界息、國聯行政院二十三日會議完畢後、即行休會、二十四二十五兩日在會外接洽程序問題、預計本星期六（二十六日）再行開後、即將通過將李頓報告書及本屆會議紀錄移送十九國委員會討論、但日代表對此仍極反對、本星期六會議時或將投反對票、但其餘十三國均將投票贊成、按國聯會章决議案之通過、須全禮同意始能生效、但手續及程序問題、祗須三分之一之同意票、即發生效力、故日代表雖反對、不能阻止實現移送十九國委員會之計劃云、（二十三日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日代表部對於二十一日中國代表顧維鈞之聲明、本擬今日加以反駁、其後因反駁文尙需修改、故今日祇由松岡代表在理事會演説、而對顧維鈞之反駁現决停止、或將於二十四日或二十六日之理事會另行反駁、</p>
<p>（日内瓦）此間舞臺、今日以德國與軍縮爲主劇、故中日爭點之討論、以代表間私人談話爲限、其所談者、大都在考慮於昨日雙方發言劃明其陣綫、應採何種步驟耳、時局至形複雜困難、故談話範圍極爲機密、就英代表方面而言、英代表今日未與中日代表有何接觸、但此爲意中事、因英國現頗似處於司法地位也、各小國代表尙未表示其對於此事之意見、就目前所知、各小國未必在明日行政院會議時發揮意思、衆料明日集會時、日代表將答辯顧博士之言論、聞中代表雖不願在行政院大開舌戰、然亦未必聞日人之答辯而不駁覆也、行政院或許李頓勳爵有發言機會、俾對於日人批評其報告書之苛論、加以答覆、惟各大國則不致發表重要言論、旁聽席中有人建議、將此難題提交華盛頓公約簽字國之會議、而請俄國參加之、第可恃消息、俄國不願加入此種會議、而美國亦不欲在此討論中、有直接之動作也、至行政院對於此問題之討論、將歷時幾何、或採何途徑、國聯方面之負責方面、多不願加以推測、但亦有人謂行政院於本星期内、當可擺脱之、關於此點、有本地著名報紙國家報之評論、大堪注意、該報以爲行政院不應以意見之交换、及李頓報告書連同行政院意見之提交國聯大會、遽自視爲已完曅其在國聯盟約第十一條下之調停工作、行政院應仍設法打開直接諒解之門户、李頓報告書中有直接談判之建議、固已表示此種程序矣、國聯大會之組成份子、大都爲與遠東未有直接關係之國、故國聯大會易爲過失須加糾正之一念所支配、由此觀之、將此問題提交國聯大會一層、允宜鄭重云、據可恃方面消息、國聯大會可望於十二月初、舉行特會、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>召集特會形勢</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）今日下午國聯要人聲稱、逆料日本鑒於國聯行政院目前形勢、當不致再執迷不悟、就法律點頑强反對將全部中日爭執移交十九國委員會及國聯大會特别會議之提議、因目下一般人意見、僉謂日本即反對此種手續、亦將徒勞無益、諒日本當不致採此無甚希望之立塲、徒鹵莽破壞應有之程序也、惟十九國委員會料亦不過在形式上簡略討論一過、然後召集國聯大會特别會議、因自十九國委員會成立以來、勢已大有變更、必須再向國聯大會討取新訓令也、所以此次大辯論、將在十二月間之國聯大會特别會議及其十九國委員會秉承特别會議意旨草擬新决議案之際、至該新决議案逆料將採取完全反對會員國承認「滿洲國」僞組織之方式、目下已有若干小國聲明欲在行政院會議中開始辯論、因日人曾有僅日本獨能適合於决定是違背條約之狂言、故非常憤慨、急欲出而一伸正義、但大國代表刻正勸說諸小國勿從事長時間之討論、靜待國聯大會特别會議中盡量罄述、倘諸小國從大國之言、逆料行政院會議將迅速通過議案、將全部問題移交十九國委員會、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>松岡出席發言</h3>
<p>謂田中奏摺係屬僞造</p>
<p>指排貸爲變相的戰爭</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日國聯行政院於午後三時三十分開會、報名發言之日代表松岡到會稍遲、狀頗沉默、議長凡勒拉主席、並未致詞、即請松岡發言、松岡稍飲水後、啓口即稱、渠保留日後必要時再發批評之權、渠今日專事答覆星期一日午後顧維鈞博士所陳説之主要點、顧指其前言喩日本爲中國膏吻中之懦羊、實則渠並不欲以此喩日本、日本之非懦羊、入盡知之、松岡否認如承認日本對於凱洛格非戰公約之解釋、則此公約即將喪失其價値一説、繼對顧維鈞博士所讀中國意見書、表示意見、謂日本並無如中國所説之大陸計畫、日本並無此駭人性質之主義、世人無庸恐慌、二千年來、日本僅有所謂日本拿破崙者一人、曾夢想征服亞洲、而於公歷七百六十八年頓告失敗、日本縱有種種開拓之機會、然未利用之、日本之篤愛和平、於此可見、松岡言及顧博士所發關於日本若干政治家言論之意見、謂渠對此點、不欲討論、因行政院用集合若干政治家不愼重言論之方法、人人可對於任何國家提出嚴重罪案、繼言及田中奏摺、松岡切實聲稱從未有此奏摺、日皇亦從未接到此文、此種荒謬之談、無待否認、渠與田中有密切關係、深知無此事也、一九三○年王景春曾允設法　止散播此項僞文、而發生之不良影響但顧博士今竟請行政院注意於此僞文、一若確有此文、毫無疑義者然、由此可見中國官塲之前後自相矛盾矣、此種小册、源源入美、大小學校皆有之、以此爲日本大陸政策之　證、但熟知奏章之體裁者、一望而知其爲僞造、松岡於是引奏章中若干節、以證實其説、如奏章中所述之御前會議事、當時日皇適有病不能從政、何能召集此種會議、再僞造者顯然不知地理、指菲列濱與日本相距一箭之遙、實則相去一千七百哩、若干華人鑒於僞造文件欺騙外人之成功、似頗興奮、乃另出一種僞文、名日本拓務省之會議錄、此種文件有無價値、行政院當自能鑒别之、松岡又述及排貨事、謂中國在受外人壓迫時、始行排貨一説、實非真相、中國常用此向列强要索讓步、松岡指排貨爲變相的戰爭、顧博士所稱排貨爲和平的自衛方法、是中國已自承認排貨爲合法矣、渠認此事殊爲嚴重、溯中國大規模之排貨、始於對美、近年秉屢用此法對付列强云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>日内瓦反日空氣濃厚</h3>
<p>小國希望日本退出國聯</p>
<p>西班牙代表態度尤激烈</p>
<p>（東京）時事新報接日内瓦長谷川特派員電稱、目下日内瓦之空氣、比前次聯盟會議尤爲深刻、各小國對於日本之脱退聯盟、非常歡迎、彼輩代表以爲日本脱退聯盟、使歐洲聯盟各國將來可維持聯盟規約之信條、極力慫恿大國、反日空氣異常濃厚、而其所以如此者、㈠因日本態度依然强硬、迄示覺悟、㈡日本脱退聯盟無損於小國、反可强固歐洲聯盟、㈢最近各國爲自國利害關係、非常同情於中國云云、</p>
<p>長崎日日新聞云、西班牙代理代表駐法大使馬德里阿加氏反日甚烈、彼對於大國之横暴、極爲憤怒、彼特樹旗幟、將於總會時提出㈠日本速即取消「滿洲國」、㈡絕對不承認「滿洲國」二大主張、又南美各小國對於美國之熱意、非常贊同西班牙代表之意、彼輩以日本之滿洲對策、與列强之過去侵略政策、抱合同的觀念、雖經我（日本）代表辯論廣洲問題與歐美事情之惟質不同、卒不能得各小國之諒解、結果惟有脱退聯盟而已、目下西班牙正式代表已决定外相治爾愛德出席、此次理事會渠將爲反日之急先鋒云、</p>
<p>日本光中有强權無公理</p>
<h3>長岡力倡大陸政策流血主義</h3>
<p>（東京）今晨六時半、（即日内瓦二十二日下午十時半）日代表長岡春一由國聯播音台播音云、因滿洲問題日本流血兩次、今次屬於第三次、三次流血須從根本解决、第一次清日戰役、第二次俄日戰役、皆爲實行明治皇帝欽定之大陸政策、兩次戰爭所以得勝、實爲國民一心一德援助所致、第三次之勝敗亦操在日本國民、昨日在行政會松岡代表根據軍事行動後之新事實、主張日本之要求、顧代表依然重説真理公道、事實當能制勝公理、日代表已下大决心、處决日人二十年來積心處慮經營之滿洲、完成明治皇帝之大陸政策、可見日人依然主張以武力消滅公理、（二十三日華聯社電）</p>
<h3>日本再施恫嚇</h3>
<p>反對中日爭案移送特會</p>
<p>以撤回全部代表相要挾</p>
<p>倡設東亞聯盟兩分天下</p>
<p>拉攏蘇聯加入牽制英法</p>
<p>（東京）據日本内瓦來之情報、國聯方面以日本政府决意强硬、難於短時日内解决、理事會有將問題移牒總會開十九國委員會之意外、外務省雖尙未接到公電、但日本政府以滿洲問題、並非有使中日斷絕國交之虞之事件、故絕對反對適用聯盟規約第十五條、移牒滿洲問題於總會之舉、且李頓調查團係根據理事會之任命、故理事會有十二分盡審議報告書之義務、若理事會不將此報告書與以何等實質的結果、竟無責任將問題移交總會、亦所絕對反對、萬一議長强行移牒總會、日本决始終堅持上述主張、俟移牒總會案提出理事會時、日爲本促國聯之反省起見、即决由日内瓦撤回代表部、亦非得已、外務當局正注視此一兩日中之趨勎、（二十二日電通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）據日外交界訊、國聯一般空氣於日逐漸不利、十九國大會之開幕又迫在眼前、日外部處此狀熊之下、愈覺有與國聯衝突之危險、爲援和目前之危機、日外部除一方訓令日内瓦各代表加緊抓作各大國懇其援助外、仍是脱不了虚聲恫嚇手叚、以脱退國聯而組織東洋聯盟、而中日問題範團屬東洋、應在東洋聯盟解决等、並宣佈要求俄國參加東洋聯盟、以牽制英法意各國、企圖挽救其喘死之運命、（二十三日華聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外部接到日内瓦代表報告、謂國際形勢對日不利、各國重理不重情、日本所主張者均以軍事行動所造成之新事實爲根據、歐美人多不理、外交部白鳥情報司長及谷亞洲司長等接此消息、對國聯前途甚悲觀、主張立即退出國聯、在遠東别圖、其主張要網如左、㈠國聯爲英法壓制歐洲各小國之機關、日本繼續帮忙、爲歐洲大國傀儡、於日本毫無所得、㈡對滿洲問題、英法不能帮忙日本、即日本帮忙英法壓迫歐洲各國、實爲無爲犠牲、㈢英法欲藉博中國好感、乘機與日本分益滿洲、日本斷不能容認、㈣美俄不加入國聯、不能代表全世界輿論、</p>
<p>具有上列四項理由、主張立刻退出國聯、邀請美俄及我國在遠東組織遠東聯盟、與國聯兩分天下、此派乃屬外交部中之軍閥派、日本元老派外交家視此見解爲空想、多置之不理、謂日本欲組織遠東聯盟、除軍部手創之「滿洲國」以外、日本若不改變對滿政策、恐無一國肯怒加此聯盟云、（二十三日華聯社電）</p>
<h3>松岡對美送秋波</h3>
<p>（東京）松岡洋右本月二十日與美國軍縮代表台維斯會見時、松岡提議在遠東組織遠東聯盟、邀美俄參加、如美國不參加、則日本自有打算云、（二十三日華聯社電）</p>
<h3>赫禮歐遲遲其行</h3>
<p>（巴黎）報載法總理赫禮頣已取消日内瓦之行、因覺目下在日内瓦接洽之德國軍備平等要求問題、渠似無親自參加之必要、現料在十二月第一星期國聯召集大會討論中日爭執以前、赫氏似未必赴日内瓦、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>傀儡代表圖活動</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）東北僞組織之宣傳代表美人李</p>
<p>亞氏及漙儀私人代表丁士源、意欲向國聯陳述意見、聞係由日人發起、刻已函請主席凡勒拉、凡氏尙未答復、據若干方面意見、即令兩人如願以償、恐亦未必能得何益處、李亞已在此間、丁逆則尙末到（二十二日國民社）</p>
<p>（東京）據日内瓦來電、滿洲國代表丁士源被拒絕入瑞士國境、後經矢田公使斡旋、瑞士政府遂登許可入境、已於今晨十一時由巴黎出發晩九時抵日内瓦、（二十二日日聯社電）</p>
<h3>日本將進一步要求修改盟約</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）日代表松岡昨日在國聯行政院演説、要求認抵貨（即杯葛運動）爲非法後、今日日代表團又在此間揚言、日政府將更進一步、正式提出修改國聯盟約動議、貫澈此種要求云、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<h3>美國對我同情</h3>
<p>重申史汀生主義</p>
<p>拒絕承認僞組織</p>
<p>（日内瓦）傾向中國之各方面歡迎華盛頓來電之發表、據稱、國務院雖决計在討論中日爭案時嚴守緘默、而美國消息靈通方面則謂、國聯如抱利於中國之熊度、各國自將拒絕承認「滿洲國、」此則美國懹抱已久之政策也云、此間親華方面咸覺美國可恃方面在此時重行聲明史汀生不承認「滿洲國」之主義、至可歡迎、因此種消息旣可使已傾向中國之同情愈形鞏固、又可在不甚表同情於中國之、方面發生良好影響也、聞顧維鈞博士現準備說帖、駁斥星期一日松岡所言及之數點、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）美國國務院在行政院開會討論之際、當保持緘默熊度、并準備加入各國不承認「滿洲」之聯合宣言、國聯會人士對於此項消息、加以有興趣之批評、但一般人因華盛頓政府在滿洲事件正由行政院討論時、即將美國未來行動之範團予以宣佈、未免爲之驚異、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>駐日美使演説和平</p>
<h3>謂長此武足以招致財政破產</h3>
<p>大阪美國駐日大使克理優、昨午后六時、在關西日美協會招待會席上演説云、美國民以誠心誠意、支持國際和平運動、恰如奴隸制度、絕跡於今日之文明國然、蓋支持力諜實現文明國間絕跡戰爭之人也、此項運動爲全美國民根本的統一希望、今更有一事、爲美國民所關心者、厥爲日本財政上保持安定、繼續繁榮、經濟的繁榮乃永久和平自然的歸結、而戰爭行爲、足使財政破產、余希望日本國民於確保國際和平、更加一層之努力（二十三日電通社電）</p>
<h3>中美代表歐歡宴</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）美國現以極密切之注意、視　時局、但視在目前階級中之中日爭執、全爲國聯所應處理之一事、是以不　遽表示任何意見、出席軍縮會之美代表台維斯、爲在日内瓦之最重要美國人物、定明日與中代表會餐（二十二日路透社電）</p>

<p>以締結軍事同盟爲交换條件</p>
<p>但法國態度甚爲冷淡</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日此間復有日本於上星期内、重圖向法國獲得巨額借欵、作爲日法政治及軍事同盟交换品之說、法政界及銀行界對此極爲注意、據稱日大使署曾於一月前、向法外部非正式探詢此事上星期松岡洋右赴法總理赫禮歐午宴時、席間重行提及借欵及重延一九一七年條約事、但法人態度極爲冷淡、不得要領而罷、嗣松岡又商諸銀行家、法銀行亦不願貸欵與日、於是日代表又密向軍火商如施尼徳等接洽、軍火商雖願貸欵與日本或僞組織、但其力量不足以說動法政府及銀行家、縱施尼徳軍火廠控制日法銀行、而該銀行資力薄弱、祇能爲賒售子彈墊欵、無力賒欵僞組織或在滿洲投資云、（二十二日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）前上海字林報記者格林今日發函倫敦泰晤士報、謂人皆　其戰績於滿洲間題、李頓報告書將因此而有發人忽視之危險、據格林之見解、李頓報告書對於中國内局主張國際合作、與内部改　之處、所佔篇幅較解决滿洲間題爲多、國聯苟採用整個的而非片段的報告書、則在此主張中、其事業將有極大機會矣云、泰晤士報載長社論一篇、謂國聯行動在遠東非絕無影響、苟無此行動、則可怖的大戰爭、殆難免發作於華北、自始蔑視國聯之日本、今則亦請願於國聯矣、國聯行政院不能判定有罪與否、因事態之惡化、兩國皆不能無責也、但國聯須知何者爲其所能爲、何者爲其所不能爲、而</p>
<p>不嘗試現有組織所可容許的範圍以外之事、此乃要着、國聯不能一舉手而將滿洲再變爲中國省分、但亦必須堅决拒絕承認「滿洲國」因此邦之存在、與李頓報告書相牴觸、而此報告書者、乃國聯必須據以謀取解决之基礎也云、彙聞報政治記者克明斯氏刻在日内瓦、據其觀察、渠以爲自上次會議以來、輿情更不滿於日本、頗有不使國聯盟約屈服之堅强决心、克氏謂英代表可設法使勿操切行事、但英代表將贊成拒絕承認「滿洲國、」或拒絕在其發展中合作之宣言云、（二十二日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日内瓦之外交戰</h3>
<p>— 又玄</p>
<p>一、　×　×　×　×</p>
<p>日内瓦中日兩國外交戰。已於本月二十一日正式展開。日本對國聯調查團報告之意見書。亦同日發表。我國各報亦曾加以嚴正之駁議。日本一般輿論。受其軍部之指揮誤認事實。對我國作無聊之攻擊。如該意見書第五章結論所述。『第一謂中國陷於無政府的混亂狀態。第二不能保障外人之生命財產。第三行使排外政策。日本受害最大第四日本在滿洲有世界無比之特殊地位。第五滿洲官憲侵迫日本之權益。第六九一八事件出於自衛。第七滿洲之獨立爲民衆自發的行動。清室復辟僅爲其指導力』。以上所述意見其眞實價値何如。不待智者與專門家之估最。即已明白陳列於吾人之前。彼借口中國不能保障外人生命財產。行使排外政策以挑動列國之感情。而事實具在决難一言抺殺。對於東北彼更製造萬寳山案中村案。以作其行使侵略政策之起步。况九一八事變當日多門第二師團遠在仙台。即出現於長春其第二十師團原住朝鮮之龍南。亦同時攻我遼寗。則是日本之所謂自衛也者。特侵略獨占之别名耳。豈有他哉。至於『若洲』獨立。乃自飾爲民族的自發行動。以曾爲日本同盟者之英國所派李頓爵士。亦認爲『滿洲國背後實由於日本軍隊用官吏所操縱』。如果日人否定其爲動亂之源。試問六百餘名之日本官吏。十萬陸軍具何種合理的根據而揷入『滿洲（傀儡）國』之組織。是故日本對調查團報告之意見書。吾人始終認爲抺殺眞實的事實。僞告虚言。以兵力威脅中國。以危詞恫嚇國聯。猶巧飾其名曰。『保持東亞和平。』號爲『自權的發動』。其誰欺僅足以麻醉其軍國主義狂熱之日本人耳。</p>
<p>二、　×　×　×　×</p>
<p>至於日本代表松岡洋右在國聯行政會議特别會之演說仍不外重述以上意見加强挑動列强對華惡感之語調。以爲中國國民運動。悉爲排外運動。而以排斥日貨問題爲主眼。睛以排貨運動。中國政府實居於領導地位。作彼所謂自衛權之掩護。侵略東北三省之烟幕。同時更舉出『國民感情。時間稽延。恐事態惡化。自然途徑』等四點。作不委託國聯公斷東北爭端之陳述。又復左右遮掩。謂日本不欲與任何國家戰爭。無領土野心。更非侵略國家。綜其實際。無非欲借詞拖延。以遂其對華侵略。試閱軍部之代言人半澤玉城。在十一月下旬號外交時報。所著『希望國際聯盟』一文中所述四項理由。一則提倡對東北延期解决。再則勸國聯靜觀。綜合松岡氏所論。亦是如此。使日本而果不欲戰爭者。何爲一九三三度預算。軍事費竟超歲出總計百分之五十以上。設使日本而未侵略滿洲。何以東三省境内駐有十萬之日本陸軍。設使日本而無領土野心。何以僞國中有六百餘人之日本官吏。矧日僑之駐於東三省者。僅二十萬有奇耳。何用兩僑民而須一兵士保護之。世界上不經濟而又愚笨之事。孰逾於此。自衛之說如自我團發動。以抗抵日本之軍事侵略。猶不失爲嚴正之意味。合乎公理正義之舉。</p>
<p>三、　×　×　×　×</p>
<p>善哉乎。我國代表顧維鈞氏之言也。『···日本無端侵略中國土地之時。中日關係是否仍爲友好。中國固欲借國聯謀取和平解决。但中國覺有在可能時。制止侵略的軍隊陸續前進之必要。中國擇此消極抵抗之形此舉較合人道。······亦足見中國政府忍耐溫和的政策之特質。······日本開始侵略東三省。···中國政府在現狀之下。即立法以抵制日商日貨。而製定實行抵制之更進一步的方法。亦未爲不合情理。···』此確已表明我國溫和忍耐達於極點之態度。任何國家當之。决不能再事讓步。且恐流血之戰爭。早已遍滿於東亞矣。况抵制日貨之舉。在九一八事變之後。而排貨運動。又屬於國民的自動行爲耶。凡一國政黨而果爲國民所擁護者。其領導國民抵禦外侮。非物和平的排貨運動。是所應該。即鐵血奮爭。亦屬必然。否則名敵之來。國人职起抗拒。更爲當然中之當然。誰能非之所不幸者吾國抵貨。尚未克澈底實行。以與敵方作長期的殊死奮戰耳。</p>
<p>四、　×　×　×　×</p>
<p>外長羅文幹氏以爲『蘇炳文之抗日義軍勝過外交部千百抗議與宣言。</p>
<p>···』此誠爲一針見血之痛論也。當此之時。我國失地三百七十六萬七千七百方里遭受鐵蹄蹂躪之人民數逾三千萬。僅以「排貨運動」表示其溫和的抗議。其爲柔弱已可概見。彼日本境猶不自悔司其軍國主義侵略之。非尚囂囂於虚僞之辯論以文飾其惡辣。我國人素好和平。非至山窮水盡之時。决不肯作流血之爭鬥。然而日本軍國主義者一再相迫。旣侵遼吉復擾北滿。繁榮之閘北。竟至在日軍飛機之下化爲瓦礫塲。此而可忍。尚有何力以生存於世界乎。故黑山白水間之健兒。不甘受欺凌。突起阡陌之間。與敵人作殊死爭戰。雖未能以眞正的鐵拳回擊敵方。促其覔悟。而民族百年爭鬥意識。已深入人心。雖百萬之師。亦不可拔。在政治的形式。縱不免尚有多少弱點。而國民向心之力。確已日趨集中。漸次集結其實力。即以東北義勇軍而論。在四面圍攻中之苦鬥。前仆後起。使組織極强。軍實甚充之日本帝國。亦不免乎手忙脚亂。則實力之後援。豈非事實之敎訓。</p>
<p>國民外交在此一髪千鈞之時。尤爲重要。日本雖盡全力以圖延宕政策之實現陷我對國聯外交於更困苦境域之中吾人亦深知國聯未必有實力以裁制日本暴行也。然而外交的運用。究不可少。樽俎折衝。烏可或缺。我國代表。旣已竭力於和平的奮鬥。我國民當準備實力爲外交後援。尤須以實際的努力。開關未來新路。</p>

<p>▲路透二十二日柏林電　興登堡總統致希特勒之函、内容現漸洩漏於外、說者遂信希氏自任總理之謀、今又失敗、聞總統接希氏關於組織新閣之答案後、答稱、無論何人担任此席、必須得國會多數云、希氏現覺能否依此條件担任組閣、難以决定、但至遲在星期四夜須答覆也、希氏與其左右會商終日、至晚始散、黨員僅聲稱、現尚在與總統接觸中、總統於覆函中、說明總統内閣不能由一黨之領袖指導之、故希氏縱組内閣、必以國會爲基礎、就現象觀之、希氏未必能獲多數、而巴本則有在本星期杪復握政權之望</p>
<p>▲國民社二十二日柏林電　國家社會黨要人、今夜晤記者、希特勒向總統與興登堡之最後提議、恐在星期三晨間以前、未必能選出、又謂渠等信希氏不欲組織在國會内有大多數擁護之内閣、因信此種内閣不能持久、且在目前、幾亦不能獲得國會内大多數擁護云、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯社二十二日柏林電、希特勒已會同國社黨各主要黨員、及政界要人、將興登堡對渠所提之條件、加以考慮、希氏對於某某數點、提出問題、請求興登堡加以詳細說明、興登堡之復函、已於今日下午送交希氏、在政潮未解决以前、此項函件不致發表、據吾人所知、興登堡復函謂、議員内閣、如希氏所担任組織者、應在議院中有最廣泛之多數黨、以免受各小黨之要脅、並可恃此項大多數爲後盾、以施行政治、如此、則不致再適用憲法之第四十八條、而簽發代法律之命令矣、希特勒又請中間人、詢問國家主義派首領胡根堡、是否能加入渠所組織之内閣、担任公衆經濟部部長、並聲明有關政治之各閣員位置、如總理·内務·司法等、均爲國家社會主義派保留、胡根堡答稱、然氏之提議、渠尚不願接受、因實際加入之後、終必爲然黨排擠、國社黨方面、則以爲胡根堡一派之拒絕、係欲使國社黨入於難關、希特勒因此請求組織一種不純恃議會多數黨之總統内閣、以使照白魯寗及巴本之先例、頒布代法律之命令以施行政務、第希氏此種要求、恐難滿意、</p>

<p>▲國民社二十二日柏林電　羣衆視線雖咸集於閣潮、但各報仍留地位、登載外長牛賴資在日内瓦與各國外交家商談德國重返軍縮會議之可能性、各報謂牛氏雖已與台維斯及西門會談此事、㣲有進步、而照英相麥唐納原議、召集五國會議、對德國軍備均等要求、作最後之决議一舉、今亦復活、然德國返軍縮會議之希望、今尙迢　、因法　迄今尚未　有承認德國要求之行動故也、但法國今正處多事之秋、故對此事不甚注意、惟靜待談論之結果耳、</p>
<p>英國會討論失業問題</p>

<p>▲路透二十二日倫敦電　今日午後、下院開始辬論答覆英皇開會訓詞之文、英相麥唐納對於反對黨藍斯堡抨擊政府政策之言論、發言辯護、謂工黨曾設法以救濟工作、應付失業問題、但費用達最高點時、失業人數迅速增多、兩年前失業狀况、較目前爲惡劣、政府固當提倡屬於市政之各種尋常事業、但捐稅必不可濫用、政府所須應付者、在貿易已恢復至國人所可期望之程度時、失業者仍將不乏其人、故此非暫時救會之問題、政府現仍與有關係各部、規劃辦法、以復催農業爲要着、國民之直接與農業有關者、其百分數必須視工廠業發達時爲更大、至於對外事件、世界經濟會議現遇若干阻力、但英政府仍促其早日開會、軍縮問題、外相西門日前已有陳述、渠不欲贅言、想全院對於西門之在日内瓦爲國宣勞、當亦一致予以信任也云、查藍斯堡責備政府不即設法救濟失業、故英相有此答覆、</p>
<p>▲路透二十二日倫救電　前内務大臣薩繆爾、今日在下院辯論中、述及英國恢復金本位問題、謂英國在未來經濟會議中、或爲他國促迫恢復金本位、目下局勢頗危英國固當加以穩定、但非俟　國際商業之之拘束開弛、戰債問題解决、英國實無從爲力、此二事苟不豫光加以適當之注意、則英國縱恢復金本位、、其結果恐必爲勢所迫仍有廢除之一日云、</p>

<h3>暴風雨中的日本（日本通信）</h3>
<p>地震以來的最大天災</p>
<p>家屋倒塌崖石崩潰</p>
<p>東京受災不小靜岡补害尤甚</p>
<p>軍國主義侵略盛行的日本、自以爲氣呑一世、通全世界誰能奈何牠、其實牠内在的癌腫、并不見得比中國輕些、夫事的關係且留待後論、現在先說最近發生的天災、</p>
<p>本月十四晚上十時光景、東京陡起風暴、又下大雨、和平的都市、忽然間就變作森羅地獄差不多、街上行人絕跡、自命是勇士的警察、在這時候也不敢出來、電燈幾乎全部息滅、特别是歡樂之鄕的淺草區、平常那些燦爛的裝飾、飛舞的彩旗、都一捲而光、被風雨奪取了去、并且完全木造的房屋的屋頂、有許多也被刮了去、晚上十時、又正是遊人上市的時候、一般善男妙女、個個都像雨打鷄一般、歸家無路、在無頂的屋中受風雨的欺凌、築地一帶、比較低下的地方、還受海潮的襲擊、雖然不算得很厲害、却也受驚不小、街上的電桿一類的東西、吹倒了的在一半以上、家屋倒塌了的有二千多户、浸了水的有四萬三四千家、樹木折斷的有一千五百多根、受害最甚在是小石川·蒲田·户塜·高田·日暮里·等處、與水上署有關係的船隻、流失了三十六隻、電報電話都不通了、東京車站、一時陷於混亂的狀態、外間的車被風雨所阻、開不進站、在站的車、也開不出去、</p>
<p>據日本中央氣象臺所發表在東京的風速、每秒有二十米達、比百米達短距離賽跑要快三倍、</p>
<p>横濱就比較的兇些了、風速每秒爲三十六米達、其受災的程度、當然比東京更甚、并且靠近隣保館的崖壁、突然倒下來了、附近的二十户民家、都被壓倒、死傷的有二十餘人、并且有一百幾個人埋在裏面、警察方面、得着了這種情報、於是選派得力警察、會同附近的靑年團、在鄕軍人會員、在風雨强襲之中、從事於救助的工作、旣不能點燈、又沒有電燈、即簡直是一種戰場的景况、</p>
<p>靜岡縣東部所受風雨的災害、比之大地震的時候所受的、據說還更甚、家屋倒塌、電桿折斷、比東京還更多、鈴川驛附近的東柏原起火、延燒至中柏原西柏原、并且還蔓延到大野新田、合計燒了三百五十棟房子、其他三百多棟、差不多都在半倒壞的狀態之下、勉强立着、沼涬市内、也倒壞了七八十家房屋、日本木造的房屋、紙糊的窗子、一旦着火、就難於灌救、加以强風、那就更沒有法子、其他關東各縣都遭受相似的災殃、不過因爲電報電話都不通、當地再也得不至竹麽消息、</p>
<p>這次的大風雨、受災最甚的是勤勞大衆、在經濟恐慌期中、他們也須得忍受低减工資和失業的痛苦、現在他們當局的人、說是經濟已經轉好、至少也有向着好的方面轉變的象徵了、因爲據日本銀行所發表的物價指數、生絲漲價百分之五十二、小麥貴了百分之六十七、米則今年五月以來無甚大變動、而美棉則高漲百分之一百三十五、印棉約漲八九成、大豆·豆餅亦漲起百分之八十以上總之一切生活必需品、（除米以外）都繼續增漲、大體都在百分之五十左右、這就是所謂好市面的象徵、可是同時在另一方面失業的人、已由四十八萬多人增加到五十一萬餘、其所附從的家族、還不在内、如果把家族都計算上、則受失業苦痛的人、至少會有一百五十萬、即現同時有工可作的人、遇着物價高漲、貨幣價值低落、其所得工資、并不曾增加、一般社會生活、反而更見低落、特别是這回受過了風雨災害的地方、雖然沒有因此死亡大量的人口、可是房屋倒塌的損失、在恐慌的時期中加得重負擔、不能不說是一件極苦的事何况明年又要加上至少十一億日金的公債、而農村間却因爲物價高漲、米價低落、反而更受損失、於是乎左右兩極端的思想、都特别發達、乃集中其憤怨於政治當局、暗殺團體、乃如雨後春笋、近來因爲大演習（秋操）‘自天皇以至於軍事領袖都去參觀秋操、首相齋藤、也西下參與、又幾乎被某暗殺團所算、所幸警察方面早發覺了、在京都車站捉着了一個人、現時尚在嚴重　查、其内容如何、請待續報、因此可以窺見暴風雨的襲來、不僅是在這一部分而已、（十一月十七日於日本東京）</p>

<h3>國難救濟會對國際聯盟之主張</h3>
<p>中華民國國難救濟會、對於國聯調查報告、及解决東省事件、最近發表主張、並輯印報告批評、業已發售、其結論尤爲精警合理、茲特撮錄於次、亦以見民衆主長之一般也、其結論云、「報告書的内容已在上面一一加以檢討、他的矛盾和疏漏的地方也隨處加以指摘、現在我們要把我們就全部所得的感想、和因感想而結成的意見、向國際聯盟、世界民衆、得我國政府及全國民衆、表明一下、㈠告際聯盟和世界民衆、調查團報告書陳述事實、很多允當的地方、它的建議遷就事實太過、也許是因爲希望和平太急、苦心調停、我們也很願意諒解、但報告書實在含著兩個很大的缺點、這種缺點無論是調查團疏忽不經意、還是故意規避、他的關係却非常重要、足使報告書陷於不能逕行採用之地位、這是關心解决中日紛爭的國聯和世界民衆十二分注意的兩種缺點是什麽、第一、東三省事件是日本侵略政策的一階段、不是偶發的一事件、日件侵略政策來源很畏、他四十年來呑台灣、割　太、併朝鮮、租偣關東、攻佔島靑、脅訂二十一條等等、無非一步一步擴張他的領土、推廣他的統治、以謀支配全亞、稱霸世界、這次占據東三省不過是此種一貫政策中預定的一個步驟、不是徒然而來、也决不就此終止、這不但有以前的事實可爲鐵證、就是日本當局的軍人和政治家或密奏他的皇帝、或公告他們國人、也歷歷不諱、所以要問東三省事變的根本原因、就是日本的侵略政策、調查團對中國政治發展和東三省近年狀况、叙述甚詳、以爲可以闡明中日爭議之背景、甚至謂因排外宣傳之熱烈、遂以造成本案發生時之特殊空氣、而於日本侵略政策逐步推行的實况、和近年日本軍閥猛烈從事侵略的言動毫未加以叙述、是對本問題眞正核心並未探到、反把四周附隨發生的結果當做問題的原因、使關心此事的人、不能眞正認識本案的起源、將來難免不因此產生錯誤政策、豈不是一個大缺陷、第二、東三省事件是日本侵略政策的實行、决非爲權益保安問題、這從事件的本身可以完全證明的、九一八及以後日軍行動决非自衛、日軍政當局又再三宣言决不使東三省與中國政治上再生任何關係、這都是實行侵略極顯明的證據、姑不多談、且看調可團報告書對日本在滿權益、不但維護備至、且有許多地方替他擴張保障、若果日本是爲權益保安、早當躊躇滿志、何以日本當局對報告書大駡特駡、主張抹消第九十兩章全部呢、可見日本要呑併東三省作支配全亞基點、毫無可疑、所以要解决中日東三省紛爭、維持永久和平、只有將日本破壞國際公約任意侵略之一切行爲、加以根本有効之糾正、使他憬然知難、變更其傳統的侵略政策、然後才算得解决、若誤認日本是保護權益把他遼法造成的局勢、雖不承認全部、却承認一部、不必說日本因有違本心不肯接受、就是他暂時拉受、然而他從此知道侵略是有效的、國際的約束終是廢紙、更可放瞻一步一步實行其侵略政策、那裏還有和平可說那裡還有國際聯盟存在的意義、不僅弱小國家將永久成爲强國的犠牲品、就是强國也將永久受日本侵略政策攪擾了、這道理極爲明白、可惜報告書和建議、间竟見及不此、豈非又是一個大缺陷、我們爲世界眞正和平着想、以爲解决東三省事件的核心、在挫抑日本的侵略政策、挫抑日本的侵略政策、只有一條大道、就是絕對擁護國際一切公約、使他全發生效力、所以我們認爲解决中的紛爭、應嚴守以下三原則、㈠國際聯盟應根據盟約及九國公約非條戰約、否認日本九一八以來對東三省所取之一切行動、限期由日本將兵隊撤回九一八以前原駐地點、㈡關於東三省爭議部題俟前項實行後、中日兩國應嚴格遵守現存有効各條約、商訂其解决方法、並調整其糾紛情形、如有爭議不决、應送國際聯盟公斷、㈢國際聯盟爲實行前兩項原則、應嚴格施行聯盟規約第十五條及第十六條規定之程序及手段、二·告我國政府和全國民衆、我國旣加入國際聯盟與各國共担維持世界和平的大任、那末日本侵略東三省一案我國遵守盟約、訴請國聯糾正實是我們應盡的義務、不能說不對、但我們應切實注意兩層、第一我們應當依照盟約努力維持世界眞正和平、却不能遷就規避盟约假和平而受無益犠甡、第二、聯盟的權威和實力能否十分發揮、很可憂慮、我們應把這種可危的國途、放在打算中、切實做自立的準備、所以在將開的國聯大會中、我們主張我國要將日本侵略政策的過去、現在及將來、根據事實、極力闡明、使各國澈底了解維持永久和平、只有挫抑日本侵略政策一法、毅然採取我們上面所說三項原則、同向正當路上走去、至報告書所載事實、隨處可引爲日本侵略的旁證、它所舉的原則也可酌採爲論據、但它的建議雖覺基心可諒、却係敷衍辦法、不能達到眞正和平、這是不可盲從的、我們歷來所痛心的、就是政府除走國聯一條路外、决不向自立自衛上痛切下一番準備工夫、須知國聯本身有種種困難、對東三省事件、恐怕未必能有何等有力措施、若再不準備、何異坐以待斃、準備要從外交和國防兩面做去、外交趨勢英美有聯合對日的可能、美俄亦有聯合對日的可能、要在我加闡明利害、提供担保、負起責任、以促成一新局面、决不能坐視觀成的、至於國防應由全國軍隊共同担任、精密佈置、嚴陣以待、勿庸多談、然而這些辦法、都有一最大前提、就是全國一致合作、若是政府仍牢牢的守着拒絕人民合作的制度、一黨專政、人民仍是散散漫漫存着不負責任的心思、那所說一切的一切完全都是廢話、我們不信有願亡國的政府、更不信有願亡國的人民、大家快快覺醒、快快合作吧」（全書由華通大東等書店發行）</p>

<h3>告國際書全文（續）</h3>
<p>㈡日本侵略中國之殘暴及其掩飾、甲午（一八九四）之役、日本向中國宣戰、刦奪土地金錢、并迫中國訂立各種不平等條約、自是以後、對中國之侵略日益露骨、而最足以表現其野心者、莫如中國五（一九一五）年乘歐戰方酣之際、强迫袁世凱承認之二十一條、據此條約、不啻變中國爲日本之屬地、此全中國人民所痛心疾首之恥辱、亦日本所旦夕不忘之計劃也、後日本田中向日皇呈　之文書、更明言「欲征服世界、必先征服中國」、九一八與一二八事變、實日一顽度固之軍人實行田中之旣定方針耳、後日本出兵濟南、𠺳殺張作霖將軍、併呑中國之貪慾日熾、至九一八之役、日本軍藉口自衛、佔領滿洲三省、後且建立其一手包辦之國家、且冒全世界之大不韙、公然承認、此能謂之自衛乎、後又無故襲擊上海、使東方繁榮之市塲、變爲鬼窟、所謂自衛者固如是乎、總計一年以來、日本屠殺中國之人民在二萬以上、在中國破壞之財產在三十萬萬以上、此種無人性之行爲、能謂之自衛乎、日本爲掩飾其建立滿洲國之大不韙、對國際宣傳、謂此後根據於滿洲人民之自動組織、則證以九一八以後滿洲各地義勇軍、迄今以自動的長期抵抗、豈不足爲民衆與實際意志之表現、更見其掩飾之詞益遠事實、然日本固以善於造謠欺騙著名於世界者也、於是或謂中國爲無組織之國家、或謂之中國之蘇維埃運動發展、或謂中國之排貨爲排外、或謂日本人口過剩必須移民、種種掩飾之宣傳、不一而足、然中國政治之日益組織化、此乃不容否認之事實、而破壞中國之組織化者、日本之帝國主義政策耳、且日本國内暗殺不絕、固得自稱爲有組織之國家耶、再中國共產主義之發展、實日本侵略之結果、日本帝國主義之侵略、使大多數民衆破產、使中國之工業化困難、無以吸收多數之貧民、使中國之政治不安、不能調目貧民之動亂、日本帝國主義特不肯反省耳、至中國民衆之排貨、乃對於日本土匪行爲不得已之懲罰、且此亦爲中國民衆之良心的權利、中國民衆未嘗濫用此種權力於其他友邦也、僅對於侵略之日本、施以相當之裁制者、全世界人士可知其故也、此外日本少數軍閥欲以人口過剩掩其侵略之行爲、更爲心勞而拙、即日本有識者、亦莫不認此爲一種種無稽之謊語、蓋鐵的統計、證明日本最近人口增殖率、并未增於日本侵入中國以前、不特此也、即日本本國之北海道、與奪自中國之韓台、亦足以容大批之民、然所謂人口過剩、不過一侵略之護符耳、併呑中國傾土之藉口耳、日晒帝國主義者、曾一再笛向世界聲明、「對中國並無領土野心、」然無奈日本之行動、恒與共諾言相反、日本所否認者、實其最大之目的也、苟無領土之野心、何以尙駐數萬軍於滿滽耶、唯中國人雖爲愛好和平民族、但此并非對於侵略者不加以制裁之意、十九路軍以三萬之軍抗日本十萬之衆、垂兩月之久、終以顧念世界大局、自動撤退、卽此一事、已足證明日本之侵略、徒增中國民衆之反抗、最近義勇軍之抗戰、並不因日本飛機毒彈而稍餒、可見日本征服中國之野心、僅足增世界人士之鄙夷與憤怒耳、㈢關於國聯調查團報告書、國聯團查團費數月之精力、調查中日之糾紛、其勞瘁自爲吾人所感謝、尤其對於報告書中之尊重非戰公約、及確定九一八之暴行、與製造僞國、違反非戰公約與九國公約、可以證明調查團所持見解之公允、無背於國聯本身擁護和平之初衷、然其擁護和平、未得其道、其所建議、大出於吾人意料之外、不能不使吾人爲調查團惜耳、日本侵略主義者對報告書不滿者、蓋以其未完全擁護日本之侵略、而吾人所不滿者、在其未能適當地、履行其使命、及其對於侵略者水免仍多偏袒耳、第一、調查團認中國人民之抵制日貨、爲非法行動、爲有組織行爲、殊不知弱國對於强暴者、深惡痛絕而不顧與其往來、乃人之恒情、亦不得已之手段、任何人不得干涉之、至於所謂有組織者、亦不過表現全中國民衆之對日本量侵略、同仇敵愾耳、其次調查團認爲須由國際治理滿洲、僅留中國一名義上之宗主權、吾人固不拒絕中國之開發、需於友邦之恊𦔳、然此應保持中國之主權、始可杜絕無限之糾紛、蓋滿洲大多數爲中國之人民、有中國最大之利益之所在、且爲中國之生命線、自必維持中國之主權、大各友邦相當恊𦔳之下、始可發揮滿洲之富力、而人民亦必諒解於此種恊助共同開發滿洲、若設立所謂顧問會議、統治滿洲、則恐該地居民、羣感亡國之痛、必不能歡迎此種新政權、徒與日本侵略以最大機會而已、且此惡例一開、不啻鼓勵侵略主義之暴行、一國强奪他國之土地、毫不受公約之制裁、則恐此種行爲、將日益發生、而世界和平之前途爲之黯然矣、綜觀調查團之建議、不啻根本承認日本過去之行爲、爲合法承認、日本有侵略中國之特權、承認二十一條爲有效、此實全國民衆萬死所不能承認者一也、其次、則欲以國際共管、以代日本之獨占、此亦無異與日本以侵略之便利、且允許顧問會議中、日本得占最大之多數、如是顧問會議、亦不過日本之傀儡、各國未得開發滿洲之實益、而得助長日本侵略之惡果、此吾人對調查團深爲致疑者二也、調查團有一根本偏見、認恢復九一八原狀爲不能、認一國侵略他國、卽可承認其爲合法、則世界弱國皆無保障、而和平之危機則與日俱增矣、至謂滿洲事變、並非一國對於他國領土之侵略行爲、則調查團未免自相矛盾、日本軍事行動、旣不能謂之自衛、又非侵略、抑謂何耶、此調查團之未能據實判斷者三也、至所建議諸端、是否出乎調查團之責任以外、吾人雅不願論列、蓋建議果能公允、仍有偉大之價值、如失之公平、卽報告亦有不可、然調查團之建議、恐將徒使侵略主義之氣𦦨日長耳、此吾人對報告書不安者四也、</p>
<p>㈣吾人對於國際之希望、九一八日本暴行以來、中國政府迄今、幾於全無抵抗、中日間之表面邦交、仍無斷絕、係完全由於信賴國聯、早晚必能維持其盟約之神聖、行使權力、事國民衆更期望國聯調查團報告書發表之後、於國際上表示極明確之判斷、獲有公正解决之途徑、然因其建議、有不能不使吾人惋惜之故、吾人於是感覺國聯調查團、對中國歷史上之民族性、與中國全國民衆、一致團結、堅决抵抗之精神、容有所未解、蓋中國民衆雖夙好和平、但每遇外力侵略、至於不可容忍之程度、必羣起抵抗、再接再厲、往事俱在、昭然可覩、目下經日本繼續强暴侵略之剌激、全國民衆對於一致抵抗之熱度、實依據其對方侵略之行爲、愈久而彌增、凡中國境内之工商實業、無一事不因此受其影響、其他意外事變、及後患發生、尙非及料、皆爲日本侵略主義之貽累、卽各友邦與國聯會議、應負有切實維持盟約行使權力之責任及義務、此所望於國際者殊未可忽視也、</p>
<p>㈤結論是故阻礙中國之發展者、爲日本侵略主義、具有擾亂世界之陰謀、爲世界和平之威脅者、爲日本侵略主義、日本嘗造作謠言、謂滿洲國爲千萬民衆之意志、其實即在日本國内、有識者亦莫不認日本之侵略行爲爲不當、特少數野心軍人氣𦦨囂張、居心破壞和平而無忌耳、世界�</p>

<h3>今日四百萬現洋運東北</h3>
<p>▲二十天中裝往四次</p>
<p>▲總數共一千二百萬</p>
<p>近來滬上現欵運往東北、在過去兩旬内已裝往八百餘萬元、而今日又有大批現洋四百餘萬元、繼續載至奉天、亟將詳情查報如下、</p>
<p>報運數額　今日由滬運往東北之巨額現洋、係屬第四批出口、總計有八百十八箱、共四百零九萬元、其中三百八十九萬五千元军到大連後、再轉赴奉天、又十四萬五千元、則直運至牛莊、由本埠南榮記報裝一百五十萬五千元、東順記報裝七十九萬、永豐利五十五萬元、通時隆二十七萬元、益順恒三十二萬元、北恒義二十五萬元、東興成大昌隆各十萬元、天德祥六萬元、中行十二萬五千元、又東順記至營口者二萬元、統於今晨裝英輪離滬、</p>

<p>東北金融　我國自九月二十五日封鎖東北以來、國人已停止向東北採辦雜糧荳子油類、在理無需運載此千餘萬國幣至奉、但據由東北來滬者言、日人强占我東北後、抱囊刮席捲之心、乃將東北官營各銀錢機關之現金沒收、運日者何止數千萬元、近更强迫東北民衆、行使日本鈔票、對於我國各銀行之紙幣限制使用、至爲嚴厲、故各銀行紛至國内運載巨額現欵前往、用以備紙幣之兌現云、</p>

<h3>丨十八比六分丨</h3>
<p>〓崇德苦鬥兩江甲〓</p>
<p>〓十九比五五失敗〓</p>
<p>西靑女子籃球賽、昨晚爲第二週、五塲比賽、以兩江甲隊之以五十五比十九勝崇德、及東南以二十八比六分勝黃隊、最美妙可觀、末場西靑紅隊勝美僑婦女、二十九比十七、亦殊趣味、</p>
<h3>崇德苦戰兩江甲</h3>
<p>崇德大驚兩江　意料之外、第一節、崇德攻守皆佳、一股銳氣、兩江楊森雖連中二球、崇德罰中一分、隨手以四比四纪平手、汪香瀛之妙中、遂六比四超出、三锋以極活潑之身手、尤以汪香瀛爲最佳、第一節以十比八屈服强勁之兩江、</p>
<p>氣力不及失敗　崇德雖於第一節中佔優勝、然以年幼力小、氣力不如兩江遠甚、奔跑不能如兩江之速、後衛疲於奔命、已露困乏、守衛一鬆、第二節遂不可收拾、竟爲兩江攻入二十分之多、崇德則僅得三分、下半塲崇德不以各個防守、僅差三分於第三節、結果以五十五比十九、兩江大勝、</p>

<h3>東南精兵破黃隊</h3>
<p>東南打破第二關　黃隊雖爲劃船之勁旅、然以對東南、絕非東南之對手、四面楚歌、攻旣不能、退又不守第一節東南得六分後、方才罰中二分、此後一分不得、東南以十九比二勝前半時、下半時亦僅四分而已、東南孫章二女士失去可中之球甚多、否則更不止二十八比六分、東南旣勝紅隊、昨又打破第二關、觀察實力、錦極有望、兩江之勁敵也、惟尙有一緣隊、須愼防之、</p>
<p>潘月英全塲獨步　潘月英當爲全場之翹楚、二十八分中得二十分、擲射之準確不論其在　下射投、不慌不忙、有擲必中、可取之極、跳起爭球、亦每爲奪得、孫毓秀章哲君、稍形减色、後衛甚佳、以王志新最可、</p>

<h3>兩江乙敗於初級</h3>
<p>兩江乙與初級、以雙方球藝之較　、趣味減去不少、尙以兩江之羅綺雲爲最佳、永級較勝於兩江乙、第一節兩江以七比六勝一分、但此後卽爲永級超出、始終追隨不及、以十一比二十五失敗</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語錄</p>
<h3>祈望「永遠的上智」光照我</h3>
<p>— 景記</p>
<p>相老人評中外哲人，有下述的一種觀察：</p>
<p>「我覺得先儒中，沒有像亞利斯多德一類的哲人！連霸辣篤的理想，都沒有過！</p>
<p>孔子一生，很是高尙，可是「夫子之談性與天道，不可得而聞也」，他的門人，這般紀載。夫子自道：「朝聞道，夕死可矣！」這是什麽道，朝聞夕死也心甘，可見這道，眞可貴了·</p>
<p>老子的道可道，非常道；好在一個「常」字；天長地久，常然眞寂丨或許他原來是從小亞細亞東來中國；所以晚年又西度函谷關回去：不然，西度何爲？列子稱西方有聖人，這又是指誰，指救世主麽？</p>
<p>古猶太人，盼救世主，有如望歲，詳見舊約。</p>
<p>霸辣篤知所謂Ｂeing;因爲有許多小存在，知有一絕對存在；由此唯一存在，才有「萬有」存在。按中文「萬有」兩字，是古已有呢？還有出於明季天主敎經典呢？我不能决斷；存疑！</p>
<p>偉大哲人，畢竟是亞利斯多德，生在距今二千三百多年前，不但精名理，還能講格物；樹产科學的種種基礎，至今仍受其學說影響。他的哲學賴有聖多瑪的整理和擴大。據史傳載，老而好學臨終時候，還懇切祈於造物曰：祈望「永遠的上智」光照人！</p>
<p>亞利斯多德的偉大精神，即此一語，永垂不朽！</p>
<p>冷與熱</p>
<h3>丨時代的矛盾性丨</h3>
<p>— 傅紅蓼</p>
<p>一陣陣秋風逼緊着吹了之後，把久别未逢的冬衣，一件件都吹上了身。有錢的棄了舊的再選新的，沒錢的只在長生庫前打廻旋。冷，由心窩裏兜了出來；熱，新的衣服，穿上身是比較舊的會來得煖烘烘的，一樣的秋，一樣的在上海，冷和熱，十足的劃分出兩個現象來，丨貧和富！</p>
<p>一樣的風，在秋冬裏，襲到身上來會那樣的呌人感到驚慌，在馬路上，我彳亍着，我對着我那件一息猶存的夾袍，不禁的會發出一種同情嘆息聲的呼應，走，我低着頭向前走，迎面來了一個女郎，那雪白的狐皮大衣，把整個蛇般的身軀綑在裏頭，只露出一個動人的小面孔，雪白，一個迅速的憧憬，在我的腦海裏映了一下；</p>
<p>「······報載··北地苦寒，暮秋降雪，抗日勇士，持槍戰慄，祇要服裝充實······」</p>
<h3>殘缺的世界</h3>
<p>— 方·天·</p>
<p>世界終是殘缺的，第一是生命的受到限制。丨雖然科學家有延壽酒的發明，（見報載）然而只限於富人能享用，又只能延壽十年。十年之外，還是免不了命歸黃土。這是人生第一個大缺陷。第二個缺陷是靑春不能常駐，使一般摩登士女，半老徐娘，人雖未老，而容顏已衰，不得不借𦔳鉛朱。介人工究難敵天然，雞皮之上，弄得紅一塊，白一塊，恍如西游記中人物，煞是怕人。倘或攬鏡自照，能不擲鏡三嘆。這是人生第二個大缺陷。次如海上繁華，甲於全國，論理這東方的巴黎，該是人間的樂土。然而街頭旁皇有乞丐，攔路搶刦有盜賊，妓院肉莊林立，烟窟賭塲遍地，處處表現着社會的病態。文明與墮落正相對峙着，極歷史上的大觀。使一般富人家的太太小姐們，常具戒心，不敢把家中所有的珍寳，儘量穿戴起來滿街走，這也可算是一件憾事。他如遠東本來很平靜，日本硬要挑起戰爭；摩登小姐走在路上，碰着不旘相的瘪三，偏釘在身後，諸如此類，舉例難盡，只好就此帶住。總之這是一個殘缺不完全的世界。</p>
<p>我想，這樣的風，大槪關外的雪是更大了，持槍的那些戰士們，上頭飄着粉般的雪，全身都給埋在雪白的裏頭子：於是我又向着那個披着雪白狐皮大衣的女郎，投了一個最後的視綫，兩個雪白的影子，同時發現了出來，冷與熱，兩個顯明的對照，我身上打了個寒戰！</p>
<p>思想是那樣會襲人的弱點，一個印象退去之後，迅速的又一個跑到這上頭來。記得，這是好幾個月之前，天氣還在十分流汗的時代裏，每天翻開報紙，大家都熱烘烘的在高興捐欵，捐欵給東北抵抗着的義勇軍，當時，我是這樣想，假定都是這樣熱烈的捐下去，熱度像天氣一樣的那樣熱，不過不會消滅，這一筆驚人的捐欵，又是多麽可觀！然而秋風起了，一陣風把大家的手都給吹得縮到口袋裏去了，於是在報紙上所看到的捐欵，只是像天將亮時那些曙星般的稀少。在熱的時候大家是那樣的高興，到了冷，大家便也像冷天一般那樣蕭條。冷，需要着服裝，熱······人是跟着天氣跑的·尤其是中國人。冷與熱，十足的表現出中國人的一副時代病，在冷與熱的當中，可以看到一般人的心理丨</p>
<p>有名無實的茶館</p>
<h3>丨泰縣獨具的風氣丨</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>在任何地方，肩着茶館招牌的所在，總是一般茶博士的大本營了；獨有我們泰縣茶館，是有名無實的，小一些的茶館，至少賣點心爲其營業的本體，中等牌子，除了賣點心，並兼售一種鷄汁的湯麫：它們的組織，能使外埠人士，不敢做東道主人，名目繁多，花樣百出，敎你沒有方法應付，茶葉要自備，泡開水是堂倌的外快；譬如要吃酒，有賣酒的販子，下酒下茶的，有一碗乾絲，這種乾絲是煑成的，用蔴油·醬油·蝦子·蝦米調和起來，其味甚美丨乾絲隨吃隨增，看顧客平時賞給的小賬多寡，以定增添乾絲的次數；這一幕，是吃茶的開鑼戲，正本便是吃點心，吃鷄汁麫，這種點心，就是麫粉做的饅首，因爲上蒸籠，又呌做「小籠兒」，用蟹黃肉丁做包裏，麫湯是鷄汁魚　燒成的，有過橋、清湯等名目：譬如兩碗麫，就呌做兩個八分，每個八分，外有一盆鐥魚，呌做澆頭，其質脆而香丨江南很少這種製法：一席茶吃完，算其錢來，正帳，小帳，絞手巾，裝水焑，分門别類，一一開銷，茶飯的賬簿，拿席次做單位，又稱做廂，假如這一間第二席，便呌做廂二：光顧的人們，評理的，講生意的，東家請夥友的，學徒拜師傅的，都吃一回茶，比較吃飯淡一些的酬酢，便請一回吃茶，明明去吃饅首和麫，偏說：是「上茶館」不吃饅首和麫，通常有句諷剌的話：敎做「吃茶不吃點心，倒有個大相咧；」正如上海人說：神氣活現，像煞有介事一樣，讀者如果到泰縣去，假使有人給你這樣一張便條，「奉請明晨九句鐘某某茶社茶叙，務希光臨弗却是幸。」你切不可只當做品茗而已，必須先肅清積貨，預備去飽啖一頓。</p>
<p>如城北的斌園·盛昌·萬花樓·聚樂園，更兼售中餐晚餐，代包筵席，陳設座位，均都麗堂皇，不像一所單調的茶館；名副其實的茶館，只有一爿呌做「廣勝居」，是陸陳業會合的市塲；在溽暑逼人的炎夏，中山公園也兼售清茶，是摩登男女暑假中納凉之所，伊們是醉公之意不在茶的。</p>
<h3>死之岔道㈡㈩㈢</h3>
<p>— 范烟僑</p>
<p>唉！伊是我們的童養媳，自然沒有什麽依戀，我是這裏唯一的種子，如何可以硬着頭皮，把生我育我的爺娘撇去，連一個消息都不透給他們地走呢？但是省一頓夜飯，以爲幸福的家庭經濟謁　之中，只有天種天生的南瓜可以充飢的　村經濟崩潰之下，住在這裏，期待着老，死，有什麽意味呢？這們的想，便沒有第二個足以紛擾他意志的雜念，再憧憬到心上來了．</p>
<p>打定了主見以後，便覺得眼前什麽都光明了。挺大的南瓜有何足戀！爺娘也任着罷！與其給他們生活壓迫的苦痛，何如給他們兒子流浪在外的悵惘。</p>
<p>在太陽還未完全給地平線呑下肚去以前，他們吃夜飯了，因爲可以省掉了一盞燈，平時阿根至少吃三碗，這晚『努力加餐』，只吃一碗有半。劉大是不注意的，劉婆子是狠細心的，便問：</p>
<p>『阿根！今天身上舒服麽？一碗半已夠了』？</p>
<p>『舒服的』，想了一想，再說：「剛纔到前村去，吃了姜牛皮家一個粞米糥子」。</p>
<p>劉大聽見了姜牛皮三個字，老大不高興了，深怪兒子去和這種人往來，忍不住便說：</p>
<p>『姜牛皮沒有良心的，他爺娘早沒了，多虧他嬸娘，撫養他成人，他在前幾年，偷偷的跑了，跑得不知去向，連一個信都沒有寄來，我總以爲這們沒良心沒根基的人，一定做砲灰了，誰知他居然還活着，還想着家鄉，有幾個錢帶轉來？怕是活不成，來向嬸娘逼老宿窼罷·』他雖並未斥責阿根，爲什麽和姜牛皮交游！但是這一席話，已暗示給阿根，應當遠而避之了。阿根原想把姜牛皮告訴他的經歷，說些出來，證明這幾年在外面奮鬭，已有了把握，雖是一個排長，已超越了劉大的兒子阿根的境地了。但是姜牛皮還是一個姜牛皮，絲毫沒有表示出排長的局面來，如何可以使人相信呢。因此也咽往了，不說。</p>
<p>劉婆子不知從那裏聽來的消息，說：</p>
<p>『老頭子！你還沒有知道咧·姜二嫂子要去做老封君了。』</p>
<p>劉大撲嗤的一笑，幾乎把一口飯都噴了出來，連忙把飯碗放下來，抺一抺短鬚，扮了一個鬼臉說：</p>
<p>『可是做夢？誰做了官？就是姜牛皮做了官，也沒這種好良心；有這種好良心，也不是姜皮牛了。</p>
<p>這種含有哲理的邏輯法，直使人啞口無言，但是劉婆子還有勇氣，引經據典地和他辯駁：</p>
<p>『將相本無種，男兒當自强。種田人做皇帝的也有，朱太祖不是「看牛」的麽？』</p>

<h3>金融洋忙中的一瞥</h3>
<p>連日因客銷鬯茂、市塲中形勢頓覺興旺、一般販現之小同行，莫不手忙脚亂、瑣繁異常、　本街存底實充、故有多大銷路、而厘價尙無　　　動、大慨此次好象、可望作長時間之鞏固　、不致再有狂落之事、銀根　象、本屬目前之刻版文章、故近日依然如舊、輔幣變動亦㣲、惟銅元較有升縮耳、</p>
<p>（釐堅定拆微高）「洋厘」早市較前午略小三七五、爲七錢一分二厘八毫七忽半、午市以人心過昂、依然上騰、漲至前午原價、爲七錢一分三厘二毫半、「銀拆」早午兩市同爲四分、較前日改好二分、劃頭始終白劃、因銀根頭襯充斥異常、而銀行又有出欵、宜其無加水可言也、</p>
<p>（角幣跌銅元長）江南小洋、早市跌小半厘、爲六錢一分七厘、午市又小一厘、爲六錢一分六厘、結果兩市共小一厘半、交易早市九千角、午市五千角、廣東小洋、早市亦小半厘、爲六錢一分六厘、午市勿動、然是日午市江角與廣角價乃相埓、爲不易多見之市價、交易早市十二萬五千角、午市二萬五千角、銅元忽然回長三千文、爲三百九十九文、交易三萬七千五百零餘串、計代價九千四百兩、</p>

<p>昨（二十三日）華商證劵交易所期貨惟九六金融遠期尙未做出、其他本下月期均已開齊、交易踴躍、人氣活潑、但現貨進出無多、市塲人心不定、求供互有出入、價亦搖移不定、前後市有一元餘變動、晨初買氣較旺、價比前日一致續漲五六角左右不等、其後市上以價高賣出轉盛、盤旋而低、故午市前後兩盤爲最低落時期、惟收盤復以大户收進、且賣氣略平、又轉堅勢、結果與晨初彷彿、比前日如二○關捲統鹽稅關稅等均續漲六七角左右、其他則互有漲跌、爲數僅二三角、又金融漲八角、七年長期現貨以久無交易、較上月下旬漲達六元有半、又昨期貨交易、上午六百六十餘萬、後市四百數十萬元、合計一千零八十九萬五千元、其中鹽稅二○捲最多均達一百九十餘萬、現貨僅計二萬六千五百元、</p>

<h3>糧食米市初疲繼硬</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各路來源不多、約三十號左右、本街去路、初懈後活、形勢一蹶不振、薄稻上棧五百石、價漲角半、蘇同帮及平黎貨統提一角、洋杜尖到銷二淡、市屬軟弱、變陰元酒户不振、零交亦薄、市價稍疲、</p>
<p>（新閘）昨日襄路來船二十五六號、城鄉店胃比前市活動、常錫北粳頓提角許、中關江陰米開盤定局、早晚稻到銷二平、市無升沉、全日斛開三千五百石之謚、</p>
<p>汀贛客秈到銷兩旺</p>
<h3>丨洋米產價鬆落丨</h3>
<p>昨日洋米統市只有本街應酬一號、西貢一百包、價仍開八元、洋米存貨尙有六十多萬包、但大半因押欵及糾葛未了之關係、未能在市出樣、故流通不多、貨主堅守如故、至於產地價格、近以去化不動、價亦步落、需貢電報只有三兩六七錢、西貢四兩稍零、加上費用合申在八九元間、產地如此低價已多年未見、但合之申地價格、仍難劃算、且以存底充足、客化呆木之故、定貨一層决無成功之望、</p>
<p>湖南江西兩地之客秈、　日逐有抵埠、昨日又新到五千包左右、已在市上出樣、因近日客化甚活、南路福州·泉州兩帮相繼暢辦、胃口甚大、昨泉帮去胃稍淡、福州帮則又活潑、北站直魯兩省胃口尤佳、因米價比粉價便宜、昨日開出江西機元二百零六包、價九元九角、又機晚六百四十包、價八元六角三分至八元五角、湖南機元二百包、價十元零五角、機油一千二百包、價八元八角八分至八元五角、又機靖港米二百包、價八元二角三分、又機紅米八百包、價八元零五分、共計三千五百四十六包、由北帮與閩帮分去云、</p>
<p>標粉成交額低落</p>
<h3>丨多空都在觀望中丨</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、回好一二角左右、惟買賣各方之人心、則觀望居多、因北方小河已經封凍、大河尚未斷交通、在此時令、粉銷已不能暢旺、故客帮心思、已無續動之想、廠家方面、因抛售不易、客户亦無動靜、亦趨觀望、無意抛出、至本月份因距交割已近、阜豐徵有收進、遠期則少出入、全日交易、均見清淡、聞祇十四萬包左右、可知雙方正在互擯也、結果本月份較前日徵好二厘半、一月份小二厘半、四月份大二厘半、餘無上落云、</p>
<p>期麥市寂寞</p>
<h3>丨本月份以交割近而尙堅丨</h3>
<p>昨期麥上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈進寂之態、本月份因交割已近以現貨不豐、交貨有限、所以多頭心頭、尙覺堅硬、上午開價尙平、下午則好二分、其餘月份、交易均異常冷淡、無從比較、惟因洋麥報價徵好、人心帶緊、如二三四月份、較本週一好一二分不等、惟籌碼不多、雙方均難發展云、</p>
<h3>芝加哥小麥回堅</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、週二（廿二日）芝哥小麥、因外國小麥出產情形欠佳、各期張○·二五至一·○○分、廿一日成交數共二千萬蒲歇爾、茲將廿二日行市列左、</p>

<h3>糖市粗砂白仍趨緊勢</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以標金堅定、人氣仍佳、公會劃盤進多出少、有續緊之趨向、二十四號粗砂白劃十四兩九錢五分、原盤今明日棧租到期之貨稍有划出、惟昌興等號貨要扳十五兩、十八號中砂白十四兩、平定、二十號中砂白因存底將罄、升至十四兩四錢半、比前日好起錢半、八九十號荷赤堅定、無更動、連帮號家前到之新潮陽靑尙未開通、以貨品較次受手寥寥、昨降九兩三錢、然進户依然觀望不前、良以不甚合銷故耳、昨二四號普通粗砂白係十四兩九錢半、誤刊五兩、惠州洋之洋字誤除字）、</p>
<p>南北貨蘭花子高貨將到</p>
<h3>丨地價已升丨</h3>
<p>蘭花子近以到貨無繼、市存漸見缺乏、查身干色艶香味濃厚之高貨、已告斷檔、惟中莊尙有賤落、行售俏見升漲、據地節函訊冬氷貨、雖有續出、爲數不多、好貨已升三四元、大約下週方可運申、屆時開價、勢必增高云、</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊絲市寂寞無神</h3>
<p>昨市本埠洋莊絲市、益形寂寞、查滙市發生變化以來、海外絲市類均銷清而價堅、滬埠去電均不見轉、歐莊雖有囤胃、而開價不高、華商意興索然、市氣擯持、</p>
<p>無錫乾繭存厚銷滯</p>
<h3>丨春秋二繭共存一萬六千餘担丨</h3>
<p>無錫各絲廠自復工以來、類均努力生產、無如洋莊絲銷又趨疲滯、海外白廠經來價有跌無漲、各廠商僉以絲本不敷、不願虧本求售、是以存絲澈增、各廠商對于乾繭原料均無胃進、繭市疲滯益甚、乾繭存底不薄、全邑各堆棧共存春秋二繭計一萬六千餘担云、</p>
<h3>土莊珠茶法銷略動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠土莊茶廠製出之蝦目珠茶、英商同孚洋行因接到摩洛哥來電需求、開始搜辦、全市成交四百餘箱、售開市盤自四十兩至四十三兩、比前見跌四五兩、路莊珍眉針眉等項、保昌錦隆等行亦有零星交易、市盤除針眉一項仍趨堅定外、其餘頗難立住云、</p>
<h3>疋頭最近毛織物之奇俏者</h3>
<p>呢羢毛織物、近來軋缺俏漲者不一、其中最俏麗者當推馬褲呢、次爲眞馬棕袖　及女裝之元色大衣呢、有貨者均相率居爲奇貨、蓋市存極缺、銷路奇暢、候用者不嫌價格之高、俱皆購辦、以上三種貨色、平均已漲起一分鈿有餘、其他如套頭呢之漢令蓬·皮面兩布·預等西裝大衣呢、豹皮羢等、趨勢亦均見好、</p>

<h3>健忘病</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨據報載，「美國有患建忘病者，竟致不復忍識其愛妻與猶子，其人爲羅平斯上校，係著名社會經濟家，乃今日其妻抵此，入室後，羅氏自稱爲羅傑斯，雖與羅夫人寒暄，而不認爲妻，」因思我國有建忘者，徙家而忘其妻，我曾笑爲必無此事，殊不足信，今觀羅傑斯不認其妻孥，眞是天下事無獨有偶，則未必爲古人所臆造矣，</p>
<p>又想健忘之病，不但古人有之，美國有之，即現在我國之人，亦患健忘病者居多，而不患健忘病者殊少，外人笑我國人爲五分鐘熱度，可知我國人祇有五分鐘的記憶力，過此以後，一切或忘，非特愛妻，即國家可忘，父仇可忘，身家性命可忘，試觀我國發生一度國恥，即發現一種經濟絕交等等口號，而曾幾何時，即已烟銷雲滅，健忘病之深刻化，誠無過我國人矣，</p>

<p>— 陳葆仁</p>
<p>湖海遨遊興已闌，不堪歲暮客江干，觸來烽火心原碎，話到人情齒亦寒，家國滄桑驚變幻，山河破碎倩誰完，愴懷北望多烟樹，起舞聞鷄涙未乾，</p>
<h3>晚眺</h3>
<p>驚心滄海横流日，慨慷難酬許國心，憔悴西風殘照裏，幾聲腸斷搗衣砧，</p>
<h3>不寐</h3>

<p>常識</p>
<h3>用火爐須注意的幾點</h3>
<p>— 質</p>
<p>看了仁君「關於煤氣中毒及急救法」以後獻給用火爐諸君的幾點</p>
<p>寒冷可怕的嚴冬，尤其是風雪交加之日，那一個不喜歡圍爐取暖呢？然他們那裏曉得，當窗户緊閉，爐火熊熊的時候，因氧氣的缺乏，使二氧化碳還原而成一氧化碳，此種無色無味之氣體，吸入體内，往往致命的危險呢？所以冬天最好是不置火爐，萬一要置火爐，就應遵照下列幾點，方免危險，</p>
<p>一、火爐須有烟囱因爲煤燃燒以後，發生二氧化碳，若不經烟囱發散室外，煤爐繼續燃燒，就由還原而成一氧化碳，一氧化炭在酸素缺乏的空氣中，是不會變成二養化炭，吾人若將此氣吸入人體中，在血液内，和血色素結合，而爲養化炭血素，因血色素原來是負有運動酸素，供人體熱燒之用，一經變化，體炭養之交換，使呼吸迫促，由迫促而至困難，由困難而至停止，呼吸停止，即生命中絕，所以凡要置火爐取暖，必須有烟囱的設備。</p>
<p>二、火爐上必須置清水一壺因爐内煤然燒以後，室内空氣，一定乾燥，可以引起皮膚和粘膜的疾患，如鼻炎，喉頭炎等是，有了清水壺的設置，借水的蒸汽，可以濕潤空氣，調節乾燥。</p>
<p>三、常開窓户因烟囱的能力不過將燒後所生的二養化炭等送出室外而已，倘若密閉窓户，室内空氣有限，空氣的酸素京有限，煤的燃燒是仰給於酸素的，同時酸素又是供人體的燃燒作用，酸素用完，室外新鮮的空氣，不能入室内，室内的炭素，又不能排洩於外，結果，是一樣的危險。</p>
<p>以前各地人民死於煤爐毒氣之下，實在不少，總不外上列各原因，所以各位，寗可不置火爐，如果要置火爐，必須嚴守以上各條，以免枉死，各位切記丨</p>
<h3>幾則隨筆</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>㈠飯盌的故事</p>
<p>昨在北火車站無意中碰上隔别了整一年的Ｄ君，他劈頭這樣問：「你好麽？」「還好，只是麫包有些成問題·你呢？」「我麽，僅僅膡下一隻飯盌·」他滿口詼諧地說：「這可使我摸不着頭腦，究竟怎樣？」「你知道我從前是住在寳山路，一二八禍變劇起，逃出一個光人，後來倭奴撤退了，轉去看看，所有的東西，都成了一堆灰，翻來翻去，僅僅找至一隻在學校裏用過的飯盌，好不痛心！所幸正當敵人燒殺的當兒，我們的×先生上臺了，其後家叔也便在這站上獲得一席職位，於是兄弟就拿了僅有的那隻飯盌，跟着擠進去。」「呵，你那隻飯盌倒還値得！雖然······，雖然······，」他匆匆地點首上站去了。</p>
<p>㈡碼頭拳</p>
<p>小学生，士萼作摩登之校花，中西合壁，小開式，選手裝，洋服之大学生</p>
<p>我國学生的服裝，本來没有定例，各人自由著着便衣就成了這種錯　的現象</p>
<p>誰都知道，上海多白相月友，專門在街頭巷尾，碼頭車站，尋找生意經，最是外埠輪船駛達碼頭時，他們眞活動得利害，碼頭上站有崗警，還不敢怎樣放肆，然而大多數的車馬，總是擺在碼頭的對邊，旅客把行李點交車夫拿去，自已正想上車，往往會忽地鑽出二三位白相朋友，凶凶地向你說：「識相點，火速拿碼頭錢來，否則手槍對付！」這樣，不知有多少鄕下人被他們敲詐過。關人上週從漢口來，白相朋友圍住了他，好在他還不傻，而又一息息岡警到了，僅僅捱了一頓拳打，而今我每次碰見關人，他總說：「白相朋友的碼頭拳眞痛呢，」</p>
<p>㈢白俄乞丐</p>
<p>流落在上海的白俄，據說有九千多，除了一部份專靠公共汽車，電車罷工，搶搶開車的生意；又除了一部分販賣氈毯，販賣肥皀以外，其餘的便只有沿街行乞，中國人眞慷慨，我幾次看見一些苦工，能丢給他們好幾個銅板，那大槪因爲他們到底是「外國種吧，」昨日我走過大統路，突如其來的碰到兩位，他倆說：「你是中國人，我是俄國人，中國人與俄國人是一樣的！」接着便是低低地一句：「請給一個銅板！」我火冒透了說：「你們從前都是俄國的權貴，可知道中俄的伊犂條約？」他們悻悻然說着一大套的俄語走開了。</p>
<p>㈣弟弟養活哥哥</p>
<p>大抵一個生量殘廢的人，或是瞎了眼，而又是聾子，或是斷了手，而又是跛脚，或是他的全身，簡直生得像一隻烏龜，無疑地他是社會的消費者，那能談得上帮助别人？早幾天我經過舢板新橋，却發見一個殘廢得簡直像一隻烏龜的人，手脚長不及尺，頭不過一隻大梨子大，睡在搖籃裏，由一個高大有力的人推着他沿門討吃，那推的人，原是他的哥哥，一生就靠了殘廢的弟弟過活，這算是「弟弟養活哥哥。」</p>
<h3>關於曆書</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>「家家人家用得着，中國地界買勿着」</p>
<p>「開年新曆本，八銅板買一本丨」　　在馬路上聽到投機小販呌賣廢曆新曆本時，使你頴然司到這一歲的光陰，又到了埀盡的時候了，同在「廢曆」兩字上，使你感到人類，惰性的難拔，</p>
<p>在封建制度的社會下，以農村經濟爲基礎的中國，支配着多數人心理的，不是老莊的哲學，也不是儒家的經典，更不是什麽嶄新的主義，而是一本黃曆，一個人從出生時起，就用得着它，一直要到老死，丨不，死後出喪安葬升祠丨還得用用，總之除了出生與死亡，不能任决揀選好的日子爲兩大缺陷外，其他的行動，總得請敎請敎黃曆，挑一個美滿的日子，對於結婚做壽，造屋上樑，固然要看看宜忌，就是理髮，沐浴，求財出行，也須選個吉日，這在一切失了自信心的人羣中，是唯一的經典，所以黃曆是通俗的迷信敎科書，相應而生的就有算命巫術等等的怪現象，因爲曆書上倘沒有了那些干支，五行佛誕宜忌等等烏烟瘴氣的記載，那末他們靠此吃飯的人，便失却了活動的根據，這於社會的向上上，也不無裨益，關於曆書的迷信，曾見某筆記有這樣的一個故事，</p>
<p>有某甲很迷信，無論做什麽事，都要查看黃曆上的宜忌來定去取，一天他親戚家裏有要事，必須他到的，但查看黃曆，這一天恰逢是不宜出行的，虧他想得一法，就從牆上爬出去，以爲我只要不從大門出去，當可免去禁忌，但破舊的牆壁，兼以連日的　雨，已不很堅固，人還沒有爬過去，牆已倒下來，把某甲壓在底下，這時，他的兒子聽見聲音，連忙過來施救，用鋤頭把壓在某甲身上的亂磚扒去，但某甲雖然壓在亂磚之下，但神思却很清，他喘息着喊他兒子道，</p>
<p>「且丨且慢動手，請丨先去丨查丨一下黃曆丨看，丨今天丨動土丨不動土，」</p>
<p>這雖是一個笑話，然而信奉曆書的人，確有這種神往的情形，記之聊博一粲，</p>
<p>花瓶的答案</p>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<h3>丨爲什麽做花瓶？丨</h3>
<p>自從首都機關内僱佣女職員之後，許多刋物及附刋都大事討論起來，而他們的結果是爲什麽做「花瓶？」擁護方面說這是女子職業的先聲，男女旣然平權，當然可以在同一機關内做事，不過女子比較柔弱一點，所以工作不能和男子並駕前驅，反對方面說女子們爲什麽旁的事不好做，而願意塗脂抺粉，穿得像花蝴蝶一樣，供給大板經理的消遣。</p>
<p>我昨天遇着一位從前的女同學，她是校裏的籃球隊隊長，素有「健美姑娘」之號，但是闊别一年，她已由短裙籃球鞋的裝束，變成長袍高革的摩登女子，我們從學校生活談到現在的生活程度，知道她也做着某公司的花瓶，於是我想找我的答案，問她：「爲什麽做花瓶？」</p>
<p>「我們也明知道資本家的意思」：她回答我說「她們想利用我們的聲色來號召顧客，某公司的康克令部，不是僱佣女職員後而門庭若市嗎？再有經理先生消閒的時候，可以拿我們消遣消遣，不是也有過某部長强吻女職員的新聞嗎，這當然是我們婦女界的恥辱，你看現在趨之若騖的女子有許多，而且都是受過中等敎育的，但是旁觀者也應該從反面想想，我們女子難道不怕羞恥嗎，（例外的例外）也爲了麫包問題，如其有正當的職業，我想我們女子不見得個個自願做「花瓶」哩，恕我設個譬諭，像你一樣的許多中學畢業生，也爲了社會上人浮於事，不得已而賣文過活，不好聽的說起來，就是「文丐」但是爲什麽自有這許多人自願做「文丐」呢，總而言之，都爲了麫包問题啊，</p>
<p>我把她的話整理成上面的答案，「花瓶」這侮辱的名稱，我希望不再在任何地方發見，尤其我們賣文的同志，如其想寫一點「花瓶」的話。應該連想到自已也是被人輕視的「文丐」呢，</p>
<h3>拉雜寫來</h3>
<p>— 小牛</p>
<p>學生有兩種的地方，是不屑讓人的：一是操塲上的運動，誰不讓誰先一步；一是膳堂裏的吃飯，誰不讓誰多一筷，這兩種的地方，都是學生能力的試騐所。</p>
<p>學校裏的厠所，是學生出版自由的總機關，他們對於敎員和同學中的批評言論，在這厠所的牆壁上就可看到，如「打捯××飯桶」「×××王八」等類的標語。</p>
<p>學校的訓育部，好比是警察廳，訓育員等於巡街的警察，他的一副冷酷的面孔，使得學生見了肅然生畏，像有呑吃的模樣，所以有人說：這種的訓育主義，是敎員兼法治的精神。</p>
<p>好運動的學生，常常在運動塲中顯身手；好弄筆桿的學生，常常在報紙上發牢騷，這都是現代學生的風頭脚。</p>
<p>許多的敎員，除爲錢上課的幾點鐘與學生得以見面外，一到下課鈴，便不負責任的挾着皮包，早已悄悄地溜之大吉，與學生毫無關係可言，這種敎員，視敎書爲一種營業，不是以敎書爲一種任務。</p>
<p>敎學先生在街上遇着學生，總是低頭或偏頭的他望，裝出似乎不曾看見的樣子，如其有學生在遠遠地行他一個一禮時，他却早已看見，出勉强的似笑非笑的點一點頭，哈哈。</p>

<h3>乘人不備的窮練與苦練</h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>學習外國言　的根本辦法，就是先把字母記熟，然後　能拚字讀書。學習戲劇表情的根本辦法也是差不多的，必須先把最簡單的情緒作爲單位，逐一練習成熟，然後方能進一步練習複雜的表情。</p>
<p>在前面已經說過，你在練習下面各種表情之前，必須預備一面能夠照見你全身的大鏡子，（無論屏風式的穿衣鏡成或衣櫃上的穿衣鏡都好。）萬一你的經濟能力辦不到，或者那一面大鏡子安置的地方，你不能夠關了房門去靜心練習，那麽最好在你一個人能夠獨習的房裏牆上掛一面照見你全臉的鏡子，最好和你站着時候的目光一般高低。萬一再辦不好，你能夠獨習的地方總可以找到一點和你站着時候的目光的一個像釘頭一般大的目標。你獨習的時候，不妨就把目光集中在那目標上面。這種窮練與苦練的功去所得的結果，說不定還會比在大洋房裏的大穿衣鏡前練習的成績高强得多。老實說，敎授的人只能敎你一個方法，成績是要你學者自已的堅强意志與恒心造成功的。</p>
<p>不過有一點不可不注意。假如你凝神的目標是鏡子以外的任何物件，你必須在練習之外，常常偷尋機會，乘人不備的時候，把你已經練過的幾種表情，對鏡練習一兩遍。只要你自已不故意去引旁人的注意，也許旁人不會注意到你的。你沒有看見過有些人不是常常喜歡對着鏡子豎豎眉毛瞪瞪眼眼的嗎？只要你不說明你是在那裏專心要練成一種功夫的話，妬嫉的冷嘲熟駡也許不到於引起來的。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評商塲黑幕</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>昨天在國泰開映的「商塲黑暮」ＨighＰieasure，是威廉鮑惠爾脫離派拉蒙，而在華納公司的第一次作品。　　故事可以說很平常；也可以說很複雜，而且牠所描寫的商塲，的確是在文化進步的城市中，常常可以看見的丨這種商塲，是平常所謂的「滑頭生意」。牠處處的現實，都在譏諷那些外强中乾的大商店丨公司丨：只顧全了門面；而所經營的貨物，除去「樣子間」用以點綴的一些以外，竟是一無所有。駡盡了那些有名無實的店家，和盲目投資的人們。但是所謂的黑幕，却並不怎樣多。</p>
<p>以外，牠還素描同業的嫉妬，和相殘。都是經濟社會中，不可免，無可諱，的險詐事實。還有，就是現代流行的虚榮病，丨特别是女子，也詳盡的顯了出來丨</p>
<p>威廉鮸惠爾ＷilliamＰowell，仍舊是已往的他，對於扮一個精明陰險的商人，他是老練得很：一種深思和穩健的態度，在好萊塢是沒人比得上的。喬治雪泥ＧeorgeＳidney，在這片中飾一個很繁重的角色，他却應付裕如，作了威廉的好助手。其餘的人，就談不到什麽了：僅僅的稱職而已。攝影光線也平平。</p>
<p>許許多多的穿揷，都類於「硬滑稽」：當然這是華納攝片的一個目標丨小趣劇丨。不道都還不失之無理取鬧，反使人會高興一些。</p>
<p>牠的毛病；是談「生意經」的對白太多，（發音很好），呌塲子冷落了些。收尾似完非完的結束，雖然回照得不錯，但是一定會引起人的不滿意。</p>
<p>總之，牠是一張爲資本家，或商人，不可不看的片子啊！</p>
<p>讀者意見</p>
<h3>攝一部義軍血戰的片子</h3>
<p>— 島生</p>
<p>半年來，本埠國人所經營的許多影戲院裏，競映些十九路軍抗日作戰史，十九路軍一士兵，抗日大戰史，淞滬血戰史等關於一二八戰事的戰事影片；這種片子，無疑地可以吸引一般</p>
<h3>帶了汽車丢了愛人</h3>
<p>— 不舞</p>
<p>羅潑范多，回到好萊塢來了！你猜她帶回來些什麽東西？一輛簇新的Ｄuesenderg汽車；一件非常華麗的黑貂皮大皮；和許許多多的美麗的名貴紅寳石。</p>
<p>羅潑說：「好萊塢的男子，沒有一個能引得起我趣味的。」實在他正看中了ＢertＴaylor；她因爲要到好萊塢去拍一張新片，所以不能不離開了紐約及她的愛人。</p>
<p>的觀衆，一面也可以興奮觀衆的情感，給予一種强烈的悲壯的激剌。這些片子，對於國難之匡救，未嘗沒有一點助力；但是，我以爲不足，還有更進一步的期望。</p>
<p>我的意見··希望國内大影片公司趕快攝製幾部東北義勇軍血戰的片子。關於東北義勇軍的神勇威武，東北義勇軍的艱苦卓絕，他們怎樣的在曠野或峻嶺和頑敵肉搏，他們怎樣的在冰天雪地中單衣大戰：凡是種種爲國奮鬭，爲國犠牲的精神，都該攝入鏡頭，使之活躍於銀幕。即不能實地到東北義軍陣地之攝製，也要設法令其逼眞，愈形悲壯爲妙。</p>
<p>事實上，在這國難嚴重的時期，什麽熱情巨片，什麽歌舞巨片，鬧戀愛玩意兒的片子，都是無補事實的空頭戲，以供有錢有閑階級供賞罷了。現在所最需要的，是足以振起民族精神的片子。</p>

<h3>武俠明星查瑞龍小史</h3>
<p>— 史孟遠</p>
<p>武俠明星查瑞龍浙江定海人也，生缉生長滬上，年十四就學於商務印書館所附設之尙公小學，平日性喜習武，時校中國術敎授李偉生，甚爲喜許，隨悉心指導，卒業之後，入承天中學肄業，未幾，即爲他故而輟學，習建築業，然非其所願，有暇輒時練武術，後投滄州佟忠義老拳師拜佟爲師，未四年而藝大進，曾至萬國體育會賽武，與角者均非所敵，觀衆莫不驚服其勇云。</p>
<p>時有某西人，欲携查往海外，查以其意非至誠，遂拒絕之。後集同志數人，發起國術研究會；延聘其師佟忠義，爲總敎練。後又任商務印書館國術部主任，造就人材非少。十七年北伐軍至滬，電影界開游藝大會，慰勞北伐諸將士，查君即加入表演，遂以絕技聞於全滬，後君歷任月明公司，武俠部主任，與鄔麗珠台演之關東大俠，成績斐然，甚得時譽之好評。君年不過二十餘，一望如一介文雅之士，未識之者見之，豈料其爲大力士查瑞龍乎。</p>
<p>影界珍聞</p>
<h3>珍妮蓋諾作風最近的决定</h3>
<p>— 王之紀</p>
<p>珍妮蓋諾，她想：她所能扮演的，不僅是活潑伶俐，情竇初開的女子；就是像瑙碼希拉，康絲裴納，瓊克勞馥，等，所能扮演的角色，她也能夠的。所以她屢次的决意，要改變她的作風；然而現在她，却又放棄她的主張了丨</p>
<p>從她成功的七重天一片爲始，她繼續所演的片子，無論她扮演的是可愛的小家碧玉，或焭獨無依的孤雛；在她總是一個可愛的「妲娜。」她在成功之後，便見異思遷要改變她的作風。</p>
<p>影片公司順從她的意志，給她拍了一</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊</p>
<p>張ＴbemanwhoＣomesbatk但是失敗了，她已失去銀幕上可愛的神清了！</p>
<p>雖然失敗，她還很堅决地不願再幹以前珍妮蓋諾式的作風。外界的批評說她必需保持她七重天所有的作風；然她竟漠視的很。</p>
<p>最近福斯公司，爲她買了一篇劇本，ＲebeccaofＳunnybrookＦrom劇中人Ｒebecca，是最適合她的個性了丨然而她無論如何，不願意幹，她奪了預備給賽萊依勒斯和傑梅鄧拍演的新婚第一年，而公司預定給她的劇本，却讓瑪琳納克霜去演。</p>
<p>雖然離公演時還遠，然而從攝影塲中回來的人說，瑪琳的成績，也不亞於珍妮。</p>
<p>不只瑪琳一人，與珍妮競爭；麗琳哈凡從歐洲到好萊塢來，也和珍妮競爭的，以前麗琳在她所演的ＣongressＤances中，曾得到確能與珍妮一樣的批評。</p>
<h3>羅克原來亦怕死因爲他保了一百萬壽險</h3>
<p>— 凛</p>
<p>羅羅克的電影迷（ＭovieＣrazy），今天在光陸蘭心兩家影戲院，同時開映了。他因爲拍演這張影片，包含許多危險性，所以他保了壽險，共一百萬之鉅。他說一個人壽命的價値，是無法估計的；所以一個人的保險，亦多多益善，不必加以限制。羅克保了一百萬的毒險，在美國影戲界裏，也不算最多，因爲惠爾羅吉士，約翰巴里穆，却利卓别靈，島格臘范朋克，裴司凱登等等，都保了一百萬以上的壽險的。</p>
<p>有許多人說，賽萊與傑梅鄧，也許會拍演「珍妮式」片子，而他們成功。同時瓊裴納也有攝製「珍妮式作風的片子的意思。</p>
<p>珍妮爲保存她以前的榮譽，而駕臨摹擬她作風的人之上。同時又因爲外界的批評，要她保留她以前的作風。所以她决計放棄她改變作風的意志，仍扮演那種天眞活潑，含葩初放的女子。於是我們在不久的將來，仍右看得「七重天」中的珍妮了</p>

<p>一年前，吉爾勃ＪohnＧilbert自已感覺到他的地位是搖動了，許多觀衆都不再擁護他了，還有的人責駡或譏笑他。影片公司當局，盡力去訪問爲什麽一位數年來絕對受人讚美的大明星，忽然會被人唾棄。然而竟沒有挽救的辦法，就是爲什麽原因，也沒人知道。</p>
<p>後來，約翰自已發見了原因，他寫了一本小說，將自已作了主人翁，說「他是個非常險惡的人，一切行爲却奸猾極了，爲人壞到不可再壞，這樣就被社會厭棄了。」這一本小說，風行美國，受到很好的批評。而觀後因爲他說他自已的奸猾，反而又喜歡他了。</p>
<p>現在他又回到往日光榮的最高峯，受觀衆的愛戴。但是誰也想不到愛戴他。正是中了他奸猾的計策啊。</p>

<h3>爲什麽喜歡看外國電影？</h3>
<p>— 奚鳥</p>
<p>這許是不値得諸位討論的問題吧，爲什麽喜歡看外國電影？其實，這確是很値得我們討論的。</p>
<p>這樣沒有調查和統計的我國，對於帕來電影每年有若干部進口，和金錢有若干不飛而滾進外國人的袋裏去，當然也是一樣沒有調查和統計。不過，其數目之大得驚人，是任誰都曉得的。</p>
<p>我曾經問過好多敎育界的朋友，他們所回答我的祇是嘻嘻的笑。好像這種不在他疆界内的事他們忘記了電影是民衆敎育的一種工具。</p>

<p>誰都曉得我們的學校裏，對於國文差不多是不屑討研的；而對於英文却恰巧站在相反的地位。從中學生起，都會購得一些英文，同時，誰也會穿起一套似乎顯出小白臉的藏靑嗶嘰的西裝了。懂了英文，穿了西裝，由是英語不靈，也要說上幾句一洋涇浜」了。其餘一切的一切，也都要想直追外國人了，爲實地研究起見，看外國電影實在是幾方面着想都好的舉動。哈哈！這不是原因嗎？</p>

<h3>保羅蓬自殺後琴哈羅的哀悼</h3>
<p>— 梅村</p>
<p>保羅蓬ＰaulＢern的突狀自殺係好萊塢從來沒有受過的震動。他是影片的監製者，女明星琴哈羅的丈夫。他已經在九月六日死了，他們結婚纔只兩個月呢！保羅是好萊塢幾個時髦人物中的一個。因爲他寬宏大量，時常周濟他人的困難，所以博得一個ＴheＫindestＨeartedManinaHeartlessTown的頭銜。開追悼會的那天，有一千多人都來獻花祭他。』琴哈羅自她的丈夫死後，好萊塢一般同事和外界人士，都說她的電影生活要停頓了，但是琴並不灰心，她佩服别利勃克ＢillieＢurke的勇氣（别利在她丈夫ＦlorenzＺiegfeld死後，仍照常拍聲片ＢilloＤivorcement）。因此她也繼續拍她的「紅塵」ＲedＤusrt。（男主角是克拉克蓋勃爾）可是她感到的悲傷實在太深了，所以她回去攝片的第一天，派有一個特别護士，很周密的看護她，防她神經的昏亂，她的繼父馬玲拿辦羅ＭarinoＢello，也時常不離的追隨着當心她，以防意外。現在漸漸的恢復了，那片子也在順利進行中。</p>

<h3>電影院裏觀衆的三種惡習</h3>
<p>— 斌</p>
<p>㈠朗讀字幕··凡是到電影院裡，去看影戴的人，都是知書識字的居多，但是有幾個觀客，肚裏稍爲識得了幾個字，偏偏要假作聰明，看到了銀幕上的字幕，便好似老太婆唸經般的，嗡嗡的念了起來！這麽一讀，便鬧得旁座的觀衆，都無心看下去，所以在美國的電影院中，有一個定例，觀客有誦讀字幕者，要治以擾亂治安罪，判罰美金二十五元，因此美國電影院裏，秩序很安靜，毫無一些嘈雜的聲音。</p>
<p>㈡片斷喝采：有時候影片因開映多次了，或是多年的舊片子，往往開映到半途的時候，突然中斷，因此一般觀客，正看至有趣有味的時候，被這麽一中止，那得不懊惱；有幾個游手好閒的看客，更是的高聲喝倒采，甚至而且拍手蹬脚，秩序頓時陷人不安寗的狀態中。這個原因，一半固然是片子太舊，或是司機的疎忽，一半却是觀客，毫無公德性，</p>
<p>㈢未完先離：一般看影戲的人，她像個個都是忙人，何以呢？因爲當影片，將完而未完的時候，他們都紛紛的先後立起來，預備要走；連累後排的看客，都看不見了！這個原因，大概是有幾位看客，先看了說明書，知道某一段情節爲止，是要完畢的了，所以便立起先走，這雖然是不錯的，可是阻碍他人的視線，似乎不應該的</p>

<h3>The League of Nations Special Assembly is Expected to be Convened at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Japanese Representative Prepares to Vote Against It</p>
<p>But Two-Thirds Agreement is Effective</p>
<p>The Administrative Council Reopened Yesterday</p>
<p>Matsuoka Yosuke Continues to Quibble</p>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council met at 3:30 PM yesterday. The Japanese representative, Matsuoka, continued to deliver his speech, defending himself against the refutation by China's Gu Weijun. As for whether the Chinese representative will further refute, it is said that no decision has been made yet. In addition, the Administrative Council is expected to consult with Lord Lytton, the chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Commission, regarding the opinions of both China and Japan on the report and whether they have any comments on the speeches of the two representatives. However, it is anticipated that this is merely a formality, and Lord Lytton will likely claim that the Investigation Commission had already heard enough of the disputes between China and Japan while in the Far East. Therefore, he will insist on the proposals in the report.</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council will meet at 3:30 PM tomorrow. The first item on the agenda is the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Japanese representative, Matsuoka, will be the only speaker. Matsuoka is already listed on the agenda. The second item is the Liberia issue, and the third is the Danzig's Polish currency issue. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations Administrative Council reconvened at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 23rd to formally discuss the Lytton Report. The scheduled procedure is for Sir Lytton to deliver a speech first, respond to the Japanese opinion, and reiterate that the Investigation Commission cannot recognize the so-called "Manchukuo" and that Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" is unreasonable. Then, representatives from various countries will successively question and inquire, and ask whether the Japanese government has any intention of peacefully resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute. As for the details of the meeting, because Nanjing time is eight hours behind Geneva time, when the Administrative Council meets, it is already 11:30 PM in Nanjing. If the meeting lasts for two hours, then the situation of the meeting will only reach Nanjing at 2:00 or 3:00 AM on the 24th at the earliest. (Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, after the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council on the 23rd, it will adjourn. On the 24th and 25th, procedural issues will be discussed outside the meeting. It is expected that after reopening this Saturday (the 26th), it will pass a resolution to transfer the Lytton Report and the minutes of this meeting to the Committee of Nineteen for discussion. However, the Japanese representative is still strongly opposed to this and may vote against it during the meeting on Saturday. However, the other thirteen countries will all vote in favor. According to the League of Nations' charter, the passage of a resolution requires unanimous agreement to be effective, but procedural issues only require a two-thirds agreement to take effect. Therefore, although the Japanese representative opposes it, it cannot prevent the implementation of the plan to transfer it to the Committee of Nineteen. (Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation originally intended to refute the statement made by the Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, on the 21st. However, because the rebuttal still needed to be revised, today only Representative Matsuoka gave a speech at the Council meeting, and the rebuttal to Gu Weijun is now suspended and may be refuted at the Council meeting on the 24th or 26th.</p>
<p>(Geneva) The stage here today is dominated by Germany and disarmament, so the discussion of the Sino-Japanese issue is limited to private talks between representatives. Most of what is being discussed is considering what steps to take after the statements made by both sides yesterday clearly delineated their positions. The situation is extremely complex and difficult, so the scope of the talks is highly confidential. As far as the British representative is concerned, the British representative has not had any contact with the Chinese and Japanese representatives today, but this is expected, as Britain seems to be in a judicial position at present. The representatives of various small countries have not yet expressed their opinions on this matter. As far as is known at present, various small countries may not express their opinions at the Administrative Council meeting tomorrow. It is expected that the Japanese representative will respond to Dr. Gu's remarks at tomorrow's meeting. It is said that the Chinese representative is unwilling to engage in a major verbal battle in the Administrative Council, but he may not refrain from rebutting the Japanese response. The Administrative Council may give Lord Lytton an opportunity to speak so that he can respond to the harsh criticisms made by the Japanese regarding his report. However, the major powers will not make important statements. Someone in the audience suggested submitting this difficult problem to a meeting of the signatories of the Washington Treaty and inviting Russia to participate. However, according to reliable sources, Russia is unwilling to join such a meeting, and the United States does not want to have direct action in this discussion. As for how long the Administrative Council's discussion of this issue will last or what path it will take, the responsible parties within the League of Nations are mostly unwilling to speculate. However, some people say that the Administrative Council can get rid of it within this week. Regarding this point, the commentary of the famous local newspaper, "National Newspaper," is worthy of attention. The newspaper believes that the Administrative Council should not hastily consider itself to have completed its mediation work under Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant by merely exchanging opinions and submitting the Lytton Report together with the opinions of the Administrative Council to the League of Nations General Assembly. The Administrative Council should still try to open the door to direct understanding. The Lytton Report has already indicated this procedure with its suggestion of direct negotiations. The composition of the League of Nations General Assembly is mostly countries that have no direct relationship with the Far East, so the League of Nations General Assembly is easily dominated by the idea that errors must be corrected. From this perspective, submitting this issue to the League of Nations General Assembly should be carefully considered. According to reliable sources, the League of Nations General Assembly is expected to hold a special meeting in early December. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Situation of Convening a Special Meeting</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, important figures in the League of Nations claimed that it is expected that Japan, given the current situation of the League of Nations Administrative Council, will not continue to be deluded and stubbornly oppose the proposal to transfer the entire Sino-Japanese dispute to the Committee of Nineteen and the Special Assembly of the League of Nations. Because the general opinion at present is that even if Japan opposes this procedure, it will be in vain. It is expected that Japan will not adopt this hopeless position and recklessly disrupt the proper procedure. However, the Committee of Nineteen is expected to only briefly discuss it in a formal manner and then convene a special meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly. Because since the establishment of the Committee of Nineteen, the situation has greatly changed, and it is necessary to seek new instructions from the League of Nations General Assembly again. Therefore, the major debate will take place during the special meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly in December and when its Committee of Nineteen, acting on the instructions of the special meeting, drafts a new resolution. It is anticipated that the new resolution will take a completely opposing stance against member states recognizing the "Manchukuo" puppet organization. At present, some small countries have stated that they want to start debating in the Administrative Council meeting because the Japanese once made the outrageous statement that only Japan is suitable to decide whether it is a violation of treaties. They are very indignant and eager to stand up for justice. However, the representatives of the major powers are currently persuading the small countries not to engage in lengthy discussions and to wait until the special meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly to fully express their views. If the small countries follow the advice of the major powers, it is expected that the Administrative Council meeting will quickly pass a resolution to transfer the entire issue to the Committee of Nineteen.

<h3>Matsuoka Attends and Speaks</h3>
<p>Claiming the Tanaka Memorial is a Forgery</p>
<p>Referring to the Boycott as a War in Disguise</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations Administrative Council met at 3:30 PM. The Japanese representative, Matsuoka, who was scheduled to speak, arrived a little late and looked quite silent. The Chairman, Mr. Valera, did not make a speech and immediately invited Matsuoka to speak. After taking a sip of water, Matsuoka began by saying that he reserved the right to make further criticisms if necessary in the future. Today, he would only address the main points made by Dr. Gu Weijun on the afternoon of the 21st. Gu referred to his previous statement comparing Japan to a cowardly lamb in the ointment of China. In fact, he did not intend to use this metaphor for Japan. Everyone knows that Japan is not a cowardly lamb. Matsuoka denied the statement that if Japan's interpretation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact were recognized, then this pact would lose its value. He then expressed his opinion on the Chinese memorandum read by Dr. Gu Weijun, saying that Japan did not have a continental plan as China said. Japan did not have this alarming doctrine, and there was no need for the world to panic. For two thousand years, Japan has only had one so-called Japanese Napoleon who dreamed of conquering Asia, but failed in 768 AD. Even though Japan had various opportunities for development, it did not use them. Japan's love of peace can be seen from this. Matsuoka mentioned Dr. Gu's opinion on the remarks of some Japanese politicians, saying that he did not want to discuss this point because using the method of gathering some politicians' imprudent remarks, everyone could bring serious charges against any country. He then spoke about the Tanaka Memorial. Matsuoka firmly stated that there had never been such a memorial, and the Emperor had never received this document. This kind of absurd talk does not need to be denied. He had a close relationship with Tanaka and knew very well that this did not happen. In 1930, Wang Jingchun had promised to try to stop the spread of this forged document and its adverse effects, but Dr. Gu now asked the Administrative Council to pay attention to this forged document as if it were true and without doubt. This shows the self-contradiction of the Chinese bureaucracy. This kind of pamphlet has been continuously flowing into the United States, and all schools, large and small, have it, using it as evidence of Japan's continental policy. However, those who are familiar with the style of memorials can tell at a glance that it is a forgery. Matsuoka then quoted some sections of the memorial to prove his point. For example, the memorial mentioned a meeting before the Emperor, but at that time, the Emperor was sick and unable to attend to politics, so how could he convene such a meeting? Furthermore, the forger obviously did not know geography, claiming that the Philippines was only an arrow's distance from Japan, but in fact, it was 1,700 miles away. Some Chinese, seeing the success of deceiving foreigners with forged documents, seemed quite excited and created another forged document called the Minutes of the Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs. The Administrative Council should be able to judge the value of this document itself. Matsuoka also mentioned the boycott, saying that the claim that China only started boycotting when it was oppressed by foreigners was not true. China often used this to demand concessions from the powers. Matsuoka referred to the boycott as a war in disguise. Dr. Gu's claim that the boycott was a peaceful method of self-defense meant that China had already admitted that the boycott was legal. He believed that this matter was very serious. The large-scale boycott in China started against the United States, and in recent years, this method has been repeatedly used against the powers. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Atmosphere in Geneva is Strong</h3>
<p>Small Countries Hope Japan Will Withdraw from the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Attitude of the Spanish Representative is Particularly Fierce</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The "Jiji Shinpo" received a telegram from its Geneva correspondent, Hasegawa, stating that the atmosphere in Geneva is even more intense than the previous League of Nations meeting. The various small countries are very welcoming of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. Their representatives believe that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will enable the European League of Nations to maintain the creed of the League's rules in the future and are strongly encouraging the major powers. The anti-Japanese atmosphere is unusually strong, and the reasons for this are: 1) Japan's attitude is still tough and has not shown any signs of awareness; 2) Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will not harm the small countries, but can strengthen the European League; 3) Recently, various countries, for their own interests, are very sympathetic to China, etc.</p>
<p>The "Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun" reported that the Spanish acting representative, Mr. Madridaga, the ambassador to France, is very anti-Japanese. He is extremely angry at the tyranny of the major powers. He will raise the banner and propose two major demands at the General Assembly: 1) Japan should immediately abolish "Manchukuo"; 2) Absolute non-recognition of "Manchukuo." Furthermore, the various small countries of South America are very enthusiastic about the United States and strongly agree with the Spanish representative's views. They hold the same view of Japan's Manchurian policy as the past aggressive policies of the powers. Although our (Japanese) representative debated that the nature of the Guangzhou problem and European and American affairs is different, they were ultimately unable to gain the understanding of the various small countries. As a result, there is only withdrawal from the League of Nations. At present, the official Spanish representative has decided that Foreign Minister Gil Robles will attend, and he will be at the forefront of anti-Japan at this Council meeting.</p>
<p>Japan Has Might but No Justice</p>
<h3>Nagaoka Strongly Advocates a Continental Policy of Bloodshed</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At 6:30 this morning (i.e., 10:30 PM on the 22nd in Geneva), the Japanese representative, Nagaoka Haruichi, broadcasted from the League of Nations radio station, saying that Japan had shed blood twice over the Manchurian issue, and this time is the third time. The three times of bloodshed must be fundamentally resolved. The first time was the Sino-Japanese War, and the second time was the Russo-Japanese War, both to implement the continental policy decreed by Emperor Meiji. The reason for winning both wars was due to the unanimous support of the people. The victory or defeat of the third time also depends on the Japanese people. Yesterday, Representative Matsuoka, based on the new facts after the military action, asserted Japan's demands. Representative Gu still reiterated truth and justice. Facts will be able to overcome justice. The Japanese representative has made a firm determination to dispose of Manchuria, which the Japanese have painstakingly managed for twenty years, and complete Emperor Meiji's continental policy. It can be seen that the Japanese still advocate using force to eliminate justice. (Hualian News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japan Issues Threats Again</h3>
<p>Opposing the Transfer of the Sino-Japanese Dispute to a Special Meeting</p>
<p>Threatening to Withdraw All Representatives</p>
<p>Advocating the Establishment of an East Asian League to Divide the World</p>
<p>Coaxing the Soviet Union to Join to Restrain Britain and France</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to information from the Japanese delegation in Geneva, the League of Nations side believes that the Japanese government is determined to be tough and difficult to resolve in a short period of time. There is an unexpected possibility that the Council will transfer the issue to the General Assembly to convene a Committee of Nineteen. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received an official telegram, the Japanese government believes that the Manchurian issue is not an event that would cause China and Japan to sever diplomatic relations. Therefore, it absolutely opposes applying Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant to transfer the Manchurian issue to the General Assembly. Furthermore, the Lytton Investigation Team was appointed by the Council, so the Council has a twelve-fold duty to deliberate the report. If the Council does not give this report any substantive results and irresponsibly transfers the issue to the General Assembly, it is also absolutely opposed. In the event that the Chairman forcibly transfers the issue to the General Assembly, Japan is determined to adhere to the above claims. When the motion to transfer the issue to the General Assembly is submitted to the Council, Japan will withdraw its delegation from Geneva in order to prompt the League of Nations to reflect. This is inevitable. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is closely monitoring the trends in the next day or two. (Dentsu News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese diplomatic sources, the general atmosphere in the League of Nations is gradually becoming unfavorable to Japan. The opening of the Committee of Nineteen is also imminent. Under this situation, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs feels increasingly at risk of clashing with the League of Nations. In order to ease the current crisis, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in addition to instructing its representatives in Geneva to intensify their efforts to implore the major powers for assistance, still cannot abandon its empty threats and intimidation tactics. It is threatening to withdraw from the League of Nations and form an East Asian League, arguing that the Sino-Japanese problem falls within the scope of East Asia and should be resolved within the East Asian League. It is also announcing that it will invite Russia to join the East Asian League in order to restrain Britain, France, and Italy in an attempt to save its dying fate. (Hualian News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from its representative in Geneva stating that the international situation is unfavorable to Japan. The various countries value reason over sentiment. Japan's claims are all based on the new facts created by military action, which most Europeans and Americans ignore. Upon receiving this news, the Director of Information, Shiratori, and the Director of the Asian Affairs Bureau, Tani, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were very pessimistic about the future of the League of Nations. They advocated immediately withdrawing from the League of Nations and making separate plans in the Far East. Their main points are as follows: 1) The League of Nations is an organization for Britain and France to suppress the various small countries of Europe. Continuing to help Japan as a puppet of the major European powers will bring Japan no benefit. 2) On the Manchurian issue, Britain and France cannot help Japan. Japan's helping Britain and France suppress the European countries is a pointless sacrifice. 3) Britain and France want to win China's favor and take the opportunity to share the benefits of Manchuria with Japan, which Japan absolutely cannot tolerate. 4) The United States and Russia do not join the League of Nations and cannot represent world opinion.</p>
<p>With the above four reasons, they advocated immediately withdrawing from the League of Nations and inviting the United States, Russia, and our country to form a Far Eastern League in the Far East to divide the world in two with the League of Nations. This faction belongs to the military faction within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The veteran diplomats of Japan view this idea as a fantasy and mostly ignore it, saying that if Japan wants to form a Far Eastern League, unless Japan changes its policy toward Manchuria, except for the "Manchukuo" created by the military, no country will be willing to join this alliance. (Hualian News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Sends Signals to the United States</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) When Matsuoka Yosuke met with the US disarmament representative, Davis, on the 20th of this month, Matsuoka proposed organizing a Far Eastern League in the Far East and inviting the United States and Russia to participate. If the United States does not participate, then Japan has its own plans. (Hualian News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Herriot Delays His Trip</h3>
<p>(Paris) Reports say that French Premier Herriot has canceled his trip to Geneva because he feels that it is not necessary for him to personally participate in the German arms equality demands issue currently being negotiated in Geneva. It is now expected that Mr. Herriot may not go to Geneva until the League of Nations convenes a General Assembly in the first week of December to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Puppet Representatives Attempt to Engage in Activities</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The propaganda representative of the Northeastern puppet organization, the American Miss Lee, and the personal representative of Puyi, Ding Shiyuan, intend to present their views to the League of Nations. It is said that this was initiated by the Japanese. They have already sent a letter to Chairman Valera, but Mr. Valera has not yet responded. According to opinions from some sources, even if the two get their wish, it is unlikely to be of any benefit. Miss Lee is already here, while Ding is not yet here. (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Geneva, the Manchurian representative, Ding Shiyuan, was refused entry into Switzerland. After the mediation of Minister Yada, the Swiss government then permitted entry. He departed from Paris at 11:00 this morning and arrived in Geneva at 9:00 PM. (Japan League News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan Will Further Demand Amendments to the League Covenant</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After the Japanese representative, Matsuoka, gave a speech in the League of Nations Administrative Council yesterday demanding that the recognition of the boycott movement as illegal, the Japanese delegation here today announced that the Japanese government will further formally propose a motion to amend the League Covenant to implement this demand. (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The United States Sympathizes with Us</h3>
<p>Reiterating the Stimson Doctrine</p>
<p>Refusing to Recognize the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>(Geneva) All parties inclined toward China welcome the publication of the telegram from Washington. It is claimed that although the State Department has decided to strictly remain silent when discussing the Sino-Japanese dispute, well-informed sources in the United States say that if the League of Nations adopts a disposition that is favorable to China, the various countries will naturally refuse to recognize "Manchukuo." This is a long-held policy of the United States. The pro-China parties here feel that it is most welcome that reliable sources in the United States are reiterating the Stimson Doctrine of non-recognition of "Manchukuo" at this time because this news can not only strengthen the sympathy that is already inclined toward China but also have a positive impact on parties that are not very sympathetic to China. It is heard that Dr. Gu Weijun is currently preparing a brief to refute several points mentioned by Matsuoka on Sunday. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The U.S. State Department will maintain a silent stance during the Administrative Council meeting, and is prepared to join the united declaration of the various countries to not recognize "Manchuria." People in the League of Nations added to this information with interesting comments, but generally people felt surprised by the Washington government's announcement of the scope of future action of the U.S. at the time the Manchuria incident was being discussed by the Administrative Council. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>The US Ambassador to Japan Delivers Speech on Peace</p>
<h3>Saying that Prolonged Warfare Will Lead to Financial Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>Osaka, the American ambassador to Japan, Grew, gave a speech at a reception of the Kansai Japan-America Association last afternoon at 6 o'clock saying that the American people support the international peace movement with sincerity, just as slavery is extinct in today's civilized countries. He supports efforts to make wars extinct amongst civilized countries. This movement is a fundamental united hope of all American people. Today, another matter of concern for the American people is Japan's maintenance of stable finances and continued prosperity. Economic prosperity is a natural result of permanent peace, but acts of war lead to financial bankruptcy. I hope that the Japanese people make even greater efforts to ensure international peace. (Dentsu News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Chinese and American Representatives Dine Together in Europe</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The United States is paying extremely close attention to the current situation, but views the Sino-Japanese dispute at the current stage as something that the League of Nations should handle entirely, so it is not hastily expressing any opinions. The US representative attending the Disarmament Conference, Davis, is the most important American figure in Geneva and is scheduled to dine with the Chinese representative tomorrow. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan Seeks Loans from French Businesses</h3>
<p>Using the Conclusion of a Military Alliance as an Exchange Condition</p>
<p>But France's Attitude is Very Cold</p>
<p>(Paris) Here today, it was reported again that Japan attempted to obtain a huge loan from France within the past week as an exchange for a political and military alliance between Japan and France. Political and banking circles in France are paying close attention to this. It is claimed that the Japanese Embassy had informally inquired with the French Foreign Ministry about this matter a month ago. When Matsuoka Yosuke attended a luncheon hosted by French Prime Minister Herriot last week, he mentioned the loan and the renewal of the 1917 treaty during the meal, but the French attitude was extremely cold and he did not get anywhere. Later, Matsuoka consulted with bankers, but French banks were unwilling to lend to Japan. Therefore, the Japanese representative secretly contacted arms dealers such as Schneider. Although the arms dealers were willing to lend to Japan or the puppet organization, their strength was insufficient to persuade the French government and bankers. Even though the Schneider arms factory controls the Banque Franco-Japonaise, the bank's capital is weak and can only provide loans for the sale of ammunition, but is unable to provide loans to the puppet organization or invest in Manchuria. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Issues a Statement to Japanese Reporters Denying It</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is widely rumored in Paris that Japan intends to obtain a large loan from France in exchange for concluding a political and military alliance between Japan and France, and that Matsuoka Yosuke had proposed this matter at a luncheon hosted by Premier Herriot when he stayed in Paris recently. Upon receiving this telegram from Geneva, Representative Matsuoka issued the following statement to reporters today, denying that this matter was completely unfounded. Matsuoka said that negotiations between Japan and France for the purpose of expanding friendly relations or a military alliance (offensive and defensive alliance) are completely unfounded as far as I know. As for the claim that I negotiated a loan to Japan with Premier Herriot, I can also declare that it is entirely rumor. (Dentsu News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Some People Advocate Forming an International Special Committee</h3>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to be Permanently Stationed in Manchuria</p>
<p>To Monitor the Actions of the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to reliable sources, the League of Nations Administrative Council is currently planning to transfer the Manchurian issue to a special meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly for a decision, partly to prolong the time and partly because the hope of a resolution is still far away. However, there are rumors that the Japanese representative will come out to oppose this. In addition, it is also planned to hand over the Manchurian incident to an International Special Committee to be organized by representatives from the major powers to be permanently stationed in Manchuria as a permanent observation group to observe the actions of the puppet organization and to increase the influence of the major powers in Manchuria. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Various Foreign Opinions</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Washington Post editorial stated that if the member states of the League of Nations and the United States jointly refuse to recognize countries that have violated treaties, they can force the disintegration of "Manchukuo." Japan's reckless behavior has aroused global indignation and will invite economic and financial retaliation. A second, shorter editorial stated that China's friendship with the United States is growing stronger, and its purchases of American goods are increasing daily. Furthermore, the New York Tribune editorial stated that Japan's response to the report proves Japan's weakness. Before the Japanese people, before the Japanese militarists, Japanese diplomats are ultimately unable to resist their militarists. (22nd Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Former Shanghai China Press reporter Green sent a letter to The Times of London today, saying that everyone is focused on its war record on the Manchurian issue, and the Lytton Report is in danger of being ignored as a result. According to Green's view, the Lytton Report devotes more space to advocating international cooperation and internal reform regarding China's internal situation than to resolving the Manchurian issue. If the League of Nations adopts the entire report rather than a fragmented one, its undertaking will have a great opportunity in this proposition. The Times published a long editorial stating that the League of Nations' actions in the Far East are not without influence. Without these actions, a terrible large-scale war would have been difficult to avoid in North China. Japan, which has disregarded the League of Nations from the beginning, is now petitioning the League of Nations. The Council of the League of Nations cannot determine guilt or innocence, because both countries cannot be without responsibility for the deterioration of the situation. However, the League of Nations must know what it can and cannot do, and</p>
<p>not attempt anything beyond the scope permissible by the existing organization, which is crucial. The League of Nations cannot transform Manchuria back into a Chinese province with one wave of its hand, but it must resolutely refuse to recognize "Manchukuo" because the existence of this state is in conflict with the Lytton Report, which the League of Nations must use as a basis for seeking a solution. According to Mr. Cummings, a political reporter for the Press Association who is currently in Geneva, public opinion has been more dissatisfied with Japan since the last meeting, and there is a strong determination not to allow the League of Nations Covenant to be compromised. Cummings said that the British representative may find a way to avoid rash action, but the British representative will support a declaration refusing to recognize "Manchukuo" or refusing to cooperate in its development. (22nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, Japanese newspapers did not comment on the Geneva speech, except for Jiji News. Jiji News stated that recognizing "Manchukuo" is the only way to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute and maintain peace in the Far East. It also stated that regardless of any unfair parts of the Lytton Report, the people should restrain their anger, and Japan should give the small countries in Geneva an opportunity to express their opinions so that they can discuss freely and the League of Nations can understand the fairness of Japan's claims.

<p>Soviet Union Demands Japanese Personnel Leave the Country</p>
<h3>Karakhan Sends Letter to Japanese Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Despair over Peaceful Negotiations with Su Bingwen</p>
<p>Hopes Japanese Military Aircraft Will Avoid Passing Through Russian Territory</p>
<p>Qiqihar: The Japanese Acting Ambassador to Moscow, Amau, recently received a long document from Karakhan addressed to Foreign Minister Uchida and the Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Manchuria, which was transported to Qiqihar by plane the day before yesterday. The document concerns the stay of a group of Japanese negotiators in Mazayevskaya, Russian territory. The main points are as follows: 1) Su Bingwen has stated that he will not start peaceful negotiations with the Japanese side's committee. Judging from various circumstances, there is little hope that the Japanese negotiating committee will begin negotiations in Mazayevskaya. 2) The Soviet Union's attitude toward peaceful negotiations is based on humanitarian principles and does not refuse to provide all conveniences. However, since there is no hope for peaceful negotiations, the Japanese committee's stay in Mazayevskaya does not contribute to peaceful negotiations. The Soviet Union hopes that the Japanese committee will withdraw from the border area as soon as possible. 3) The Russian government, from a humanitarian standpoint, permits Japan to use the Bolshaya Uryum airfield, and hopes that when the Japanese military transports food, it will avoid military aircraft traveling in the border area.

<h3>Situation in Sichuan Takes a Sharp Turn for the Worse, National Government Reiterates Ceasefire Order</h3>
<p>Conflict Between Liu and Tian in Chengdu Has Stopped, Tian's Troops Withdraw Outside the City</p>
<p>Deng Xihou's Mediation Results in Five Agreed Post-War Measures</p>
<p>Liu, Deng, and Tian Issue Ceasefire Telegrams, Three Divisional Commanders Jointly Telegraph Approval</p>
<h3>Provincial Troops in the Fulu Zinei Area Have Retreated to Xufu and Jiading</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 23rd stating: "Sichuan Province, with its abundant natural resources and rich deposits of forests, minerals, rivers, and lakes, is nevertheless plagued by financial difficulties, continuous warfare, and a chaotic political situation, causing the people to suffer. The government is concerned about the people's hardships and has long understood the root causes. The primary cause is the evil system of military districts. Therefore, there was the order for rectification in the seventeenth year, intending to take advantage of the establishment of the provincial government to establish a plan to allow the people to rest. All measures, including reducing the army, reducing taxes, eliminating military districts, clearly ordering officials to take office, prohibiting the minting of currency, preparing for autonomy, promoting education, supporting local militias, and respecting the judiciary, are all being undertaken to show the minimum measures required and to establish the initial basis for improving Sichuan's administration. If, at this time, the leaders of all armies had a heart of compassion for the starving and drowning people and possessed the desire to save them, then there would be no need to worry about a lack of sincerity and no reason to reopen suspicions. Moreover, given the rich resources and abundant deposits of Sichuan Province, as well as the urgent need to manage various construction projects in civil affairs, politics, education, water conservancy, electricity, and transportation, even if all the talents in Sichuan were gathered and exerted their utmost efforts, there would still be concerns that local human resources would be insufficient or wealth would be left untapped in the mountains and forests. What need is there for distinctions between large and small military districts or disputes over lucrative stationing locations? It is regrettable that those in power are limited by their close associates and are ignorant of the long-term situation. The strong use mergers to expand their military preparations, while the weak exhaust the people's strength to resist. Some hold sway over one area, while others occupy checkpoints to seize profits. Gradually, local militias are absorbed, and local industries are destroyed. The variety of tax names has become endlessly bizarre, and the cruelty of forced loans and advance levies has spread to remote areas. Recently, disregarding the national crisis, they have used the pretext of war to engage in internal strife. The military has sacrificed its elite due to internal warfare, and the common people have been smeared with blood on the battlefield. Alas, my people of Sichuan, are they not to have a day of relief? Although there are not lacking those with a heart for governance and commendable plans, they are inevitably constrained by the environment, leading to suspicion and animosity, and ultimately falling into a situation of mutual harm. This cycle repeats itself endlessly. The waxing and waning of military districts never ceases, and the national foundation and the people's strength are on the verge of irreparable loss. Moreover, at this time of converging disasters and urgent national crisis, the humiliation of enemy invasion is unbearable. The government is not prioritizing the defense against foreign aggression or the settlement of refugees, but only engaging in internal warfare and prioritizing the accumulation of wealth. Even if victorious, it is not martial; even if wealthy, it is not benevolent. If, due to a minor disagreement, a wildfire is ignited, then the impact will affect the very foundation of the nation. Even if the leaders of the various armies are provoked by a moment of passion, they should not remain indifferent to the great plan of national security and survival. The government, entrusted by the party and the nation and bearing the heavy expectations of the people, is constantly planning to rescue the people from their suffering. Now, hearing that the situation in Chengdu and Chongqing is worsening daily, with internal strife escalating, the military is passing through, and the flames of war are spreading, turning cities and villages into ashes and the old and weak into ditches. The people, burdened with unbearable burdens, are suffering such great calamity, like adding depth to water and fuel to fire. Every time we think of this, we cannot help but feel deeply saddened. Therefore, we specially reiterate the order to rectify Sichuan's administration in the seventeenth year, instructing the Executive Yuan to detail the implementation measures and ensure that they are effectively implemented within the shortest possible time. All the military leaders and administrative commissioners in Sichuan should possess a deep understanding of the overall situation, understand the government's heart for saving Sichuan and the nation, observe the plight of the displaced and impoverished people, take responsibility and make mutual concessions, immediately stop the fighting, and strive to move forward in accordance with the Yuan's established measures to usher in a new beginning. The government's duty lies in considering the obedience or disobedience of the various armies as the standard of compliance or defiance. Let each of them respectfully comply and not disobey. This order is of utmost importance." (23rd Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Regarding the cessation of hostilities in Sichuan: 1) The conflict between Liu and Tian in Chengdu completely stopped on the afternoon of the 20th. On the 21st, Liu, Deng, and Tian jointly issued a telegram to stop the war and jointly plan for the aftermath. The troops of Tian Songyao's division inside the city completely withdrew from the North Gate on the 22nd, preparing to retreat to Tongchuan. The Tian army suffered heavy casualties during the three days and nights of fierce fighting, with the main force losing sixty to seventy percent of its strength. Tian's position in the provincial capital is unstable, and there are rumors of his voluntary resignation. 2) The provincial Liu's troops in the Fulu Zinei area have safely arrived at the designated locations in Xufu and Jiading after receiving orders to retreat, without any loss of strength. 3) Public security in the provincial capital has been restored, but the vitality has been greatly damaged. Liu Wen-hui has initiated fundraising for relief efforts. More than one hundred representatives from gentry, merchants, and public organizations have arrived, and more than ten measures have been discussed and decided for rescuing refugees and various post-war arrangements. Liu Wen-hui and the various generals have all donated large sums of money. (23rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Deng Xihou telegraphed on the 19th that both Liu and Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Li Jiayu, and Luo Zezhou advocated that all parties immediately cease military actions, discuss the date of the meeting, and properly discuss the major guidelines and detailed items, with military force as a shield and diplomacy as the priority, so that the sound of weapons will not be heard in the homeland again. Wen-hui and Tian, Yang, Li, and Luo immediately replied with a telegram of support. Liu Xiang is eager to expand his territory and will temporarily set aside Deng's telegram without reply. (23rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The conflict between Liu and Tian in Chengdu, after Deng's mediation, resulted in continued cooperation among the three armies. On the 21st, each telegraphed a ceasefire, and the generals of the three armies also jointly telegraphed their approval. Currently, all of Tian's troops have left the North Gate and are stationed outside Chengdu. (23rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a representative of the Sichuan Allied Army, the street fighting in Chengdu has ceased, and both Tian's and Liu's troops have withdrawn outside the city. If further fighting occurs, Liu has transferred troops from the north to reinforce the outside of the city, and a major battle will erupt again. The provincial army has retreated to the Min River line, and the frontline battles have eased. Xufu is undefendable and will retreat to Jiading. Another telegram states that the three armies of Yang Sen, Luo Zezhou, and Li Jiayu are advancing towards Renshou to coordinate operations with the 21st Army in the south. There are currently more than 30,000 refugees in Luzhou City, and thousands of injured soldiers and civilians, a very tragic situation. All parties are working to provide relief. (23rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Japanese news agency stated that an anti-British movement had occurred in Chengdu. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Liu Wen-hui for inquiry, it received a reply from Liu stating that there was no such thing and requested that it be corrected to rectify international opinion. (23rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) Tian Songyao indicated to Liu and Deng the day before yesterday that he would resign to recuperate and that his troops would await reorganization. Because of the Tonghua relationship, Liu decided not to go too far as long as there was mutual understanding. Deng Yang-hou's mediation was particularly effective. The proposal for Tian's resignation has been dropped. Starting from the 22nd, the three armies of Deng, Tian, and Liu continued to meet and have decided on the following five post-war measures: 1) The three army commanders Liu, Deng, and Tian will jointly issue a telegram announcing the implementation of a ceasefire from the 21st. The generals of the three armies will also issue a telegram of support. 2) Tian Songyao will voluntarily express his intention to cooperate with Deng and Liu (Wen-hui) to the end and will not be used by other parties. 3) Deng Xihou will guarantee the opening of the North Gate of Chengdu so that Tian's troops inside the city can safely withdraw outside the city before the 22nd. 4) The three armies will jointly plan for further overall peaceful measures, aiming to stop all wars within Sichuan Province within a few days. 5) The three armies will initiate a conference of all Sichuan generals at a suitable location and time within the shortest possible time, based on the central government's resolution in the seventeenth year and the three key points of Liu Wen-hui's Jiang-ri telegram, to seek an overall solution to major issues such as military affairs, politics, and transportation. The location and time are still under negotiation. (23rd Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Diplomatic Battle Outside Geneva</h3>
<p>— You Xuan</p>
<p>I. × × × ×</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese diplomatic battle in Geneva has officially unfolded on the 21st of this month. Japan's written opinion on the League of Nations' investigation report was also released on the same day. Our national newspapers have also issued stern rebuttals. Japanese public opinion, under the direction of its military, misunderstands the facts and makes frivolous attacks against our country. As stated in the conclusion of Chapter 5 of said opinion, "Firstly, China is mired in anarchic chaos. Secondly, it cannot guarantee the lives and property of foreigners. Thirdly, it implements an anti-foreign policy, of which Japan is the biggest victim. Fourthly, Japan has an unparalleled special position in Manchuria. Fifthly, Manchurian officials infringe upon Japan's rights and interests. Sixthly, the September 18th Incident arose out of self-defense. Seventhly, Manchuria's independence was a spontaneous action of the people, and the Qing restoration was merely its guiding force." As for the true value of the above opinions, it does not require the estimation of wise men or experts; it is already clearly displayed before us. It uses the excuse that China cannot guarantee the lives and property of foreigners and implements an anti-foreign policy to stir up the feelings of various countries, but the facts are there, and it is difficult to erase them with a single word. Regarding the Northeast, it even fabricated the Wanbaoshan Incident and the Nakamura Incident as a starting point for its implementation of an aggressive policy. Moreover, on the day of the September 18th Incident, the Second Division of the Multiple Gates was far away in Sendai, yet it appeared in Changchun; its Twentieth Division, originally stationed in Longnan, Korea, also attacked our Liaoning at the same time. Therefore, what Japan calls "self-defense" is merely another name for aggression and exclusive occupation. What else could it be? As for the "Manzhou" independence, it disguises itself as a spontaneous national action. Even Sir Lytton, dispatched by Great Britain, who had once been an ally of Japan, believes that "the state of Manzhou is actually manipulated by the Japanese army and officials behind the scenes." If the Japanese deny that they are the source of the turmoil, then one must ask what reasonable basis there is for inserting more than six hundred Japanese officials and ten thousand army troops into the organization of the "Manzhou (puppet) state"? Therefore, we have always considered Japan's opinion on the investigation report to be an erasure of the true facts, a false statement of lies, a threat to China with military force, and an intimidation of the League of Nations with dangerous words, yet cleverly disguising it with the name of "maintaining peace in East Asia" and calling it "self-initiated action." Who is it deceiving? It is only enough to numb the Japanese, who are fanatical about militarism.</p>
<p>II. × × × ×</p>
<p>As for the speech of Japanese representative Yosuke Matsuoka at the special meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, it was still nothing more than a repetition of the above opinions, strengthening the tone of stirring up the ill feelings of the great powers towards China, believing that the Chinese national movement was entirely an anti-foreign movement, and focusing on the issue of rejecting Japanese goods. He insisted that the Chinese government was in a leading position in the anti-Japanese goods movement, acting as a cover for its so-called right of self-defense and a smokescreen for its aggression in the three northeastern provinces. At the same time, he further cited four points, such as "national sentiment, delay in time, fear of the deterioration of the situation, and natural means," as statements against entrusting the Northeast dispute to the League of Nations for judgment. Furthermore, he covered up left and right, saying that Japan did not want to go to war with any country, had no territorial ambitions, and was not an aggressive country. In summary, in reality, it was nothing more than wanting to use excuses to delay in order to achieve its aggression against China. Try reading the four reasons stated by Tamaki Hanzawa, the spokesperson for the military, in the article "Hoping for the League of Nations" in the late November issue of the Diplomatic Times. First, he advocated postponing the resolution of the Northeast issue. Second, he advised the League of Nations to wait and see. Matsuoka's arguments are also like this. If Japan really did not want war, then why was the military expenditure for the 1933 budget more than 50% of the total annual expenditure? If Japan had not invaded Manchuria, why were there 100,000 Japanese army troops stationed within the three northeastern provinces? If Japan had no territorial ambitions, why were there more than six hundred Japanese officials in the puppet state? Furthermore, the number of Japanese residents stationed in the three northeastern provinces was only over 200,000. Why does it take one soldier to protect two overseas Chinese? What is more uneconomical and stupid in the world than this? The saying of self-defense, such as self-organization to resist Japan's military aggression, still does not lose its solemn meaning and is in line with the actions of public reason and justice.</p>
<p>III. × × × ×</p>
<p>Well said, Mr. Wellington Koo's words! "...When Japan groundlessly invades Chinese territory, are Sino-Japanese relations still friendly? China certainly wants to seek a peaceful solution through the League of Nations, but China feels that it is necessary to stop the continuous advance of aggressive troops whenever possible. China chooses this form of passive resistance, which is more humane... It is also sufficient to see the characteristic of the Chinese government's tolerant and moderate policy... Japan began to invade the three northeastern provinces... Under the current situation, the Chinese government will legislate to resist Japanese merchants and Japanese goods, and it is not unreasonable to formulate and implement more advanced methods of boycott..." This has indeed shown that our country's moderate tolerance has reached its extreme. No country can give way any further. And I am afraid that a bloody war has already spread throughout East Asia. Moreover, the act of boycotting Japanese goods came after the September 18th Incident, and the anti-Japanese goods movement belongs to the automatic behavior of the people. Whenever a country's political party is truly supported by the people, it is its duty to lead the people to resist foreign aggression, not just a peaceful boycott of goods. Even fighting with iron and blood is inevitable. Otherwise, when the enemy comes, the people will rise up to resist, which is even more natural and natural. What is unfortunate is that our country's resistance to Japanese goods has not been thoroughly implemented, so as to fight a long-term decisive battle with the enemy.</p>
<p>IV. × × × ×</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Luo Wengan believes that "Su Bingwen's anti-Japanese volunteer army is better than the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' thousands of protests and declarations..."</p>
<p>This is indeed a sharp and painful remark. At this time, our country lost 3,767,700 square miles of land, and more than 30 million people suffered the trampling of iron hooves. It is easy to see how weak it is to express its moderate protest with just a "boycott movement." The Japanese still do not repent, but insist on their militarist aggression and still clamor for false debates to decorate their wickedness. Our Chinese people have always loved peace and will never be willing to engage in bloody battles until they are at the end of their rope. However, Japanese militarists repeatedly force each other, having already invaded Liaoning and Jilin, and then disturbing Northern Manchuria. The prosperous Zhabei was turned into a rubble field under Japanese military aircraft. If this can be tolerated, what power is left to survive in the world? Therefore, the strong men between the Black Mountain and the White Water, unwilling to be deceived, suddenly rise up among the fields and fight a desperate battle with the enemy. Although they have not been able to fight back with real iron fists and urge them to find their way, the nation's century-old consciousness of struggle has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Even a million troops cannot uproot it. In terms of political form, there are still many weaknesses, but the people's centripetal force has indeed become increasingly concentrated and gradually gathered its strength. Even in terms of the Northeast Volunteer Army, in the bitter struggle of being besieged on all sides, they fell one after another, causing the Japanese Empire, which is extremely organized and militarily strong, to inevitably become flustered. Isn't the support of strength a lesson of fact?</p>
<p>National diplomacy is especially important at this critical moment. Although Japan is doing its best to implement its delaying policy and put our diplomacy with the League of Nations in a more difficult situation, we also know that the League of Nations may not have the strength to restrain Japan's atrocities. However, the use of diplomacy is ultimately indispensable. Diplomatic negotiations and compromises are essential. Our representatives have already done their best in the peaceful struggle, and our people should prepare their strength as a diplomatic support. In particular, we must use practical efforts to open up new paths for the future.</p>

<p>(Jinan) Zhang Chucai, chief of staff of the Yantai Command, reported to Shen Honglie in a telegram dated the 21st, saying that in order to represent your position, inspect the suffering of the people, and investigate the actual situation of the 21st Division, he passed through Yongfuyuan to the vicinity of Fushan City. What he saw and heard is reported as follows: 1) Travelers and merchants on the Yantai-Weifang line can pass without hindrance. The number of military vehicles and horses along the way is slightly more than 500, making way one after another, with guards stationed at intersections. 2) Villagers in each village said that the discipline of the 21st Division is strict and definitely different from before. They all thanked your position for the compromise and reconciliation. The Second Brigade, which camped in Zhuqi Village, all brought their own dry food, and the people only provided porridge, without entering the people's homes or asking for anything. The same is true of the cavalry regiment stationed in Fushan City. Near Yongfuyuan, because there is no defense zone on our side, there are no stationed troops. 3) The Second Brigade all gathered on the beach early in the morning for training, and the combat troops seemed to be definitely more than 6,000. 4) Two transport ships have already docked at the pier and loaded luggage and more than 40 horses, which have arrived at Zhuqi Village.

<p>Chairman Chiang approves adding disaster relief donations to railway and telegraph charges</p>
<h3>To fund post-disaster recovery in recovered bandit areas of three provinces</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang telegraphed the Executive Yuan, approving the previous telegram from Shi Ying, Wang Zhen, Wang Xiaolai, and others, stating that the recovered bandit areas in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui urgently needed disaster relief and that the government should add disaster relief donations to railway and telegraph charges. After separate review, the following conclusions were reached: 1. Originally requested that a disaster relief donation be added to long-distance railway passenger tickets nationwide: 4 jiao for first-class, 2 jiao for second-class, and 1 jiao for third-class. It is proposed to follow this for first-class, change second-class to 3 jiao, and change third-class to 5 fen. Third-class passenger tickets are financially weaker, and ticket prices have been repeatedly increased in recent years. Calculated as a percentage, the increase is already higher than first-class and second-class, and it is not appropriate to increase it further. 2. Originally requested that a disaster relief donation be added to freight on the Pinghan Railway: 5% for salt and coal, and 2% for other goods. Upon investigation, Pinghan freight is currently dispersed by the Longhai Line and Huaiyun, and the commerce of Hankou is declining, which is one of the reasons. It is not appropriate to increase freight charges further, which would hinder freight transportation. Moreover, in order to develop the rural economy of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, it is necessary to reduce freight charges to facilitate the circulation of agriculture. This item should not be discussed. 3. Originally requested that a disaster relief donation be added to telegrams, regardless of wired or wireless, distance, at 5 fen per telegram. Upon investigation, adding donations to telegrams has little connection with the livelihoods of ordinary people and seems to be feasible. 4. Originally requested that the additional donation be set for a period of six months, which is not too long and seems to be feasible. However, it should be stated that it should be revoked immediately upon the expiration of the limit. The above measures are forwarded to the Control Yuan for review and are to be separately ordered to the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications to follow. Please investigate and reply. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>

The text is as follows: Extremely urgent telegram to Brother Yan Bewei, representative of the Rehe National Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, and forwarded to Chairman He Junjian, I have just received a telegram from our division commander Liu Jiashan, stating that our army has been fighting at Hongxing Shuanggang on the Siping-Taonan Railway for days since occupying Zhanyu. On the 19th, in response to a telegram from Commander Su Bingwen, we urgently attacked Taonan to join forces at Ang'angxi to relieve the siege of Fularji. We immediately ordered our Lu Wenjiong Brigade to advance north at full speed. At dawn on the 20th, we were surrounded by enemy marine corps, mountain artillery units, armored vehicle units, and air force units. Fortunately, our Brigade Commander Lu took the lead, and all officers and soldiers were exceptionally brave, engaging in fierce battles with the enemy for two days and nights. Only this morning, the 22nd, did we defeat the enemy. It is estimated that in this battle, the enemy suffered more than 600 casualties, and we suffered more than 300 casualties. Brigade Commander Lu was hit by a stray bullet in his arm. Now, due to a change in strategy, we have withdrawn from Zhanyu to Gaoliban and plan to counterattack after replenishing ammunition. We are jointly reporting this and hope that you will forward it to the General Seat, urging him to go north as soon as possible to preside over everything. Brother Li Siru and Wang Yunping kowtow.

<h3>There are Claims that the World Economic Conference has Invited Chinese Representatives to Participate</h3>
<p>Hoover Argues that the Conference Should Discuss the Silver Issue</p>
<p>China's Economic Stability is Related to the World Economy</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Geneva, 22nd: Today, there are many sources here who believe that the decision by the organizing committee of the World Economic Conference to invite Chinese experts to participate in the preparations is merely a smokescreen. Its real intention is to include China's economic construction on the agenda of the conference. However, the original proposer, the American representative Davis, who is now in London, denies that his proposal contains any other intentions, saying that it is only because China is the largest silver-using country, and the silver issue may become one of the most important issues of the conference, so Chinese experts should also be invited to join the preparatory personnel. Furthermore, the authorities in charge of the various plans to be discussed at the conference have reportedly declared that the discussion of the silver issue at the conference will have no chance of success. However, experts believe that since U.S. President Hoover has made the discussion of the entire silver issue a condition for the United States to participate in the conference, it will be difficult to exclude the silver issue from the discussion at the conference. In addition, after China's participation, the silver issue will need to be considered further. Other sources also believe that the major powers have agreed that the stability of the Chinese economy will greatly contribute to the progress of the world economy. However, they are unable to explain the reasons for the recent invitation to Chinese experts to prepare, and they are also unclear about the intentions of European experts to oppose the discussion of the silver issue.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Geneva, 22nd: The League of Nations Administrative Council has organized a subcommittee to monitor the progress of the preparations for the World Economic Conference. This subcommittee met this morning, chaired by British Foreign Secretary Simon, and resolved to convene all the experts on the preparatory committee for the Economic Conference in January next year to prepare a report to be submitted to the Administrative Council for review. The Economic Conference will be held no sooner than May. Before the conference is held, the preparatory committee may convene again if necessary.</p>
<h3>Hoover Indicates Meeting with Roosevelt to Discuss War Debt Issue</h3>
<p>Progress Has Been Made as a Result of the Meeting</p>
<p>Meeting with Members of Congress Today</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 22nd: At 3:40 this afternoon, President-elect Roosevelt, accompanied by his advisor, Columbia University Professor Melle, went to the White House to meet with President Hoover to discuss the war debt issue. President Hoover sincerely hopes that this meeting can work out a common plan to deal with international financial obligations. The proposals President Hoover intends to submit to Congress will depend on the extent to which Roosevelt agrees to suspend payment of the installments due in December. It is now believed that Hoover advocates suspension. If they can reach an agreement, their power can overcome any opposition in Congress. Treasury Secretary Mills also participated in the meeting. The results of the meeting, which lasted two hours, can only be gleaned from a brief statement that said, "There is a feeling that progress has been made at the meeting." During the meeting, secret service agents guarded all the doors of the meeting room. Tonight, Roosevelt and Vice President-elect Garner will meet with Democratic leaders to discuss the same issue. President Hoover is scheduled to meet with members of Congress tomorrow. Congress has met today to exchange views. It is reported that the Italian government intends to pay the war debt installment of $1,245,000 when it is due. According to the New York Times, Roosevelt will only be a "listener" at the meeting unless he sees a complete process that combines a revised debt management plan with a plan to restore international trade. It is heard that Roosevelt now believes that negotiations with the countries indebted to the United States should include tariffs, or even new agreements on arms reduction.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Washington, 22nd: European countries have sent dispatches to the United States requesting permission to defer war debt payments and to reorganize the war debts. Recently, the Czech Ambassador to the United States also submitted a dispatch to the U.S. Secretary of State Stimson in support of other European countries.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 22nd: President-elect Roosevelt went to the White House today to meet with President Hoover for about two hours. Afterwards, a statement was released to the press, stating briefly that the two presidents met from 3:30 PM to 6:02 PM and discussed the issues raised in previous telegrams in detail and felt that progress had been made. President Hoover will meet with members of Congress tomorrow. It is also reported that Senators Harrison and George, Representatives Rayburn and Collier, and other prominent financiers such as Mr. Baruch will go to the White House tomorrow to meet with the President.</p>
<p>Hitler's Cabinet Formation Plan Fails</p>
<h3>The Issue of a Congressional Majority Arises</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 22nd: The contents of President Hindenburg's letter to Hitler are gradually being leaked, and it is believed that Hitler's attempt to appoint himself as Chancellor has failed again. It is heard that after the President received Hitler's answer regarding the formation of a new cabinet, he replied that whoever assumes this position must have a congressional majority. Hitler now feels that it is difficult to decide whether he can assume the cabinet formation based on this condition, but must reply by Thursday night at the latest. Hitler and his aides discussed the matter all day and only dispersed in the evening. Party members only claimed that they are still in contact with the President. In his reply, the President stated that the presidential cabinet cannot be led by the leader of one party, so even if Hitler forms a cabinet, it must be based on Congress. From the appearance of things, Hitler may not be able to obtain a majority, and Papen has a hope of regaining power by the end of this week.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: Leading figures of the National Socialist Party met with reporters tonight. Hitler's final proposal to the President and Hindenburg may not be selected until Wednesday morning. They also said that they believe Hitler does not want to organize a cabinet with a majority in Congress because they believe that such a cabinet cannot last and, at present, it is almost impossible to obtain a majority in Congress.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: Hitler has convened the main members of the National Socialist Party and political figures to consider the conditions set by Hindenburg for him. Hitler raised questions about certain points and asked Hindenburg to explain them in detail. Hindenburg's reply was delivered to Hitler this afternoon. The letter will not be published until the political crisis is resolved. As far as we know, Hindenburg replied that a parliamentary cabinet, such as the one Hitler is responsible for organizing, should have the broadest majority party in parliament to avoid being threatened by small parties and can rely on this majority as a backing to implement politics. In this way, it will not be necessary to apply Article 48 of the Constitution again and issue orders in lieu of laws. Hitler also asked intermediaries to inquire whether Hugenberg, the leader of the National Nationalist Party, could join the cabinet he organized as Minister of Public Economics, and stated that the cabinet positions related to politics, such as Chancellor, Interior, and Justice, are reserved for National Socialists. Hugenberg replied that he is unwilling to accept this proposal because after actually joining, he will eventually be squeezed out by the Nazi Party. The National Socialist Party believes that Hugenberg's rejection is intended to put the National Socialist Party in a difficult position. Hitler therefore requested to organize a presidential cabinet that does not purely rely on the majority party in parliament so that he can issue orders in lieu of laws to implement administrative affairs, following the precedents of Brüning and Papen. However, it is feared that Hitler's request will not be satisfied.</p>
<p>The Question of Germany Rejoining the Disarmament Conference</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Holds Meetings with British and American Representatives</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: Although the masses' attention is focused on the cabinet crisis, the newspapers still reserve space to publish reports on Foreign Minister Neurath's discussions with diplomats from various countries in Geneva on the possibility of Germany rejoining the Disarmament Conference. The newspapers say that although Neurath has met with Davis and Simon to discuss this matter, there has been little progress, and the original proposal by British Prime Minister MacDonald to convene a five-nation conference to make a final decision on Germany's demand for equal armaments has now been revived. However, Germany's hope of returning to the Disarmament Conference is still far away because France has not yet taken action to recognize Germany's demands. However, France is currently in a difficult situation and is not paying much attention to this matter, but is quietly awaiting the results of the discussions.</p>
<p>British Parliament Discusses Unemployment Issue</p>
<h3>The Gold Standard is Difficult to Restore in the Short Term</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 22nd: This afternoon, the House of Commons began to discuss the reply to the Queen's speech opening Parliament. Prime Minister MacDonald defended against the opposition party's Lansbury's criticisms of the government's policies, saying that the Labor Party had tried to use relief work to deal with the unemployment problem, but when the cost reached its highest point, the number of unemployed people increased rapidly. The unemployment situation two years ago was worse than it is now. The government should certainly promote various ordinary undertakings belonging to the municipality, but taxes must not be abused. What the government must deal with is that even when trade has recovered to the extent that the people can expect, there will still be no shortage of unemployed people, so this is not a temporary relief problem. The government is still working with the relevant departments to plan measures, with restoring agriculture as the main focus. The percentage of the population that is directly related to agriculture must be greater than when the factory industry is developed. As for external events, the World Economic Conference is currently encountering some obstacles, but the British government is still promoting its early convening. Foreign Secretary Simon has already made a statement on the disarmament issue, and he does not want to repeat it. He believes that the entire House will unanimously trust Simon's efforts for the country in Geneva. Lansbury criticized the government for failing to take immediate measures to relieve unemployment, so the Prime Minister made this reply.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 22nd: Former Home Secretary Samuel, in a debate in the House of Commons today, mentioned the issue of Britain restoring the gold standard, saying that Britain may be forced by other countries to restore the gold standard at the future economic conference. The current situation is quite dangerous. Britain should certainly stabilize it, but unless international commercial constraints are lifted and the war debt issue is resolved, Britain really cannot do anything. If these two things are not given appropriate attention in advance, then even if Britain restores the gold standard, the result will inevitably be that it will still be forced to abolish it one day.</p>
<p>Japan's Plan to Build a Large Suspension Bridge Over the Kanmon Straits</p>
<h3>Construction Cost Requires 30 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, transportation between Shimonoseki and Moji, two key locations connecting Honshu and Kyushu, has traditionally relied on ferry services. Recognizing advancements in the times and changes in societal conditions, the government has decided to construct a steel suspension bridge across the Kanmon Straits. In late this month, Interior Ministry official Nagata and his team will conduct on-site surveys, with the surveying period lasting until March or April of next year. The bridge's location is set for the Hayatomo Straits within the Kanmon Straits. The bridge will be 570 ken long and 12 ken wide. Simultaneously, military defenses will be established in the surrounding area, allowing warships to navigate freely under the bridge. The bridge's height will be determined by the highest tide level, approximately 60 feet above sea level. The bridge's structure will be divided into two levels: the first level for trains and the second level for pedestrians, carriages, automobiles, and streetcars, making it a uniquely grand suspension bridge for the entire nation. The total construction cost is estimated at 30 million yuan. Upon completion of the on-site survey, a grand conference of the Interior Ministry, Railway Department, and Army and Navy will be convened to decide on implementation.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japan in the Storm (Japan Communication)</h3>
<p>The Greatest Natural Disaster Since the Earthquake</p>
<p>Houses Collapsed, Cliffs Crumbled</p>
<p>Tokyo Suffered Considerable Damage, Shizuoka Even More</p>
<p>Japan, with its rampant militarism and aggressive ambitions, believes it can intimidate the world, but its internal problems are no lighter than China's. We will address the reasons for this another time; for now, let's discuss the recent natural disaster.</p>
<p>Around 10 p.m. on the 14th of this month, a storm suddenly arose in Tokyo, accompanied by heavy rain. The peaceful city was transformed into something resembling a hellish scene. Streets were deserted, and even the self-proclaimed brave policemen dared not venture out. Electricity was almost entirely cut off. The Asakusa district, normally a land of entertainment with its dazzling decorations and colorful flags, was entirely swept away by the wind and rain. Many roofs of the predominantly wooden houses were torn off. At 10 p.m., just when people were heading to the market, men and women alike were like drenched chickens, unable to return home, exposed to the wind and rain in roofless houses. The Tsukiji area, being low-lying, was also hit by tidal surges, which, although not severe, caused considerable alarm. More than half of the utility poles in the streets were blown down. Over two thousand houses collapsed, and forty-three or forty-four thousand homes were flooded. Over fifteen hundred trees were broken. The worst affected areas were Koishikawa, Kamata, Totsuka, Takata, Nippori, etc. Thirty-six vessels related to the waterways department were lost. Telegraph and telephone lines were down. Tokyo Station was temporarily thrown into chaos. Trains from outside were blocked by the storm and unable to enter the station, while trains already at the station were unable to depart.</p>
<p>According to the Japan Central Meteorological Observatory, the wind speed in Tokyo reached 20 meters per second, three times faster than a 100-meter sprint.</p>
<p>Yokohama fared even worse, with wind speeds reaching 36 meters per second. The extent of the damage was naturally even greater than in Tokyo. In addition, the cliff near the Rinhokan suddenly collapsed, crushing twenty nearby homes, resulting in over twenty deaths and injuries, with over a hundred people buried underneath. Upon receiving this information, the police dispatched capable officers, along with members of the local youth corps and veterans, to carry out rescue operations amidst the fierce wind and rain. With no lights or electricity, the scene was like a battlefield.</p>
<p>The wind and rain damage suffered by eastern Shizuoka Prefecture is said to be even worse than the damage suffered during the great earthquake. Collapsed houses and broken utility poles were more numerous than in Tokyo. A fire broke out in Higashi Kashiwabara near Suzukawa Station, spreading to Naka Kashiwabara and Nishi Kashiwabara, and further to Ono Shinden, burning a total of 350 houses. Over 300 other buildings were almost completely destroyed, barely standing. Seventy or eighty houses also collapsed in Numazu city. Japanese wooden houses with paper windows are difficult to extinguish once they catch fire, and with strong winds, it is even more hopeless. Other prefectures in the Kanto region have suffered similar disasters, but because telegraph and telephone lines are down, no news can be obtained from those areas.</p>
<p>The hardest hit by this storm were the working masses. During the economic crisis, they already had to endure wage cuts and unemployment. Now, officials are saying that the economy is improving, or at least showing signs of improvement. According to the price index published by the Bank of Japan, raw silk prices have risen by 52%, wheat by 67%, and rice prices have remained relatively stable since May. However, American cotton has risen by 135%, Indian cotton by about 80-90%, and soybeans and bean cakes have also increased by over 80%. In short, all necessities (except rice) continue to rise, generally by about 50%. This is what is meant by signs of good business. However, at the same time, the number of unemployed has increased from over 480,000 to over 510,000, not including their dependent families. If the families are included, at least 1.5 million people are suffering from unemployment. Even those who have work are faced with rising prices and a depreciated currency, and their wages have not increased. The general social life has become even more difficult, especially in the areas affected by the storm. Although there was no large-scale loss of life, the loss of collapsed houses adds a heavy burden during a time of crisis, which is a truly bitter situation. Moreover, at least 1.1 billion yen in public debt will be added next year, while farmers are suffering even more from rising prices and falling rice prices. As a result, both extremes of the ideological spectrum are particularly developed, focusing their resentment on the political authorities. Assassination groups are springing up like mushrooms after the rain. Recently, during the grand military exercise (autumn maneuvers), the emperor and military leaders attended, and Prime Minister Saito also went west to participate, and was almost targeted by an assassination group. Fortunately, the police discovered this early and arrested a person at Kyoto Station. The investigation is still ongoing. From this, one can see that the storm's impact is not limited to just one area. (November 17th, Tokyo, Japan)</p>

<h3>Zhu and Mao Suddenly Flee from the Fujian-Zhejiang Border into Eastern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>▲ Attempting to Invade Fuzhou via Jinxi</p>
<p>▲ Mao and Xu's Troops Cut Off the Bandits' Return Route</p>
<p>Nanchang communication: Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, Lin Biao, Dong Zhentang, Luo Binghui and other factions, after gathering on the Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Fujian border and joining forces with Shao Fang in northeastern Jiangxi, are actively moving towards the Zhejiang border, intending to attack western Zhejiang, so that they can freely plunder and solve the problem of supplies. However, the plan agreed upon by the bandit central authorities this time is to circle around the border of the bandit area and conduct guerrilla warfare in the non-bandit area, in order to disturb the large red area and avoid being confined to the barren bandit area, resulting in natural extinction due to economic blockade. According to Fuzhou news, the red bandits' claims of attacking Zhejiang and fleeing to Guangdong are all feints. In fact, the bandits stationed the pseudo-Fifth Army Corps in northwestern Fujian to guard the area, and Peng Dehuai of the pseudo-Third Army Corps gathered in Lichuan, invading Nancheng and Nanfeng, restraining the divisions of Tao Zhiyue, Li Yunjie, Xu Kesun, and Lian Zhong in the two Nans. Another faction, Lin Biao of the pseudo-First Army Corps, Xiao Ke of the pseudo-Twelfth Army, and a part of Luo Binghui of the pseudo-Twenty-second Army, suddenly attacked Zixi and Jinxi via Guangze to peep at Fuzhou. Yesterday, military sources also reported that there were few troops stationed in Zixi and Jinxi, and both were harassed by bandits in the past two days, and they moved down the Lin (chuan)-Jin (xi) highway. The bandits' vanguard has already advanced to Xuchuan, dozens of miles away from Linchuan. Therefore, the situation in Fuzhou is inevitably tense, and residents have also moved to the province to take refuge. However, after receiving news that the bandits had penetrated deep into eastern Jiangxi, the highest military authorities believed that it was a good opportunity to suppress the bandits, which could achieve twice the results with half the effort compared to going deep into the bandit area. At present, the Mao, Li, and Xu divisions in Nancheng and the Zhou Hunyuan troops in Guixi have cut off the bandits' return route from Zixi, Guixi, and the Fujian border, and surrounded them on all sides with the Sun Lianzhong and Wu Qixing troops in Yile, hoping to eliminate the bandits in Jinzi. The air force stationed in the province has been flying reconnaissance and bombing missions over eastern Jiangxi, the Fujian border, and the Jinxi area for days, which has been very effective.

<h3>The Jing-Wu Highway Will Be Completed Soon</h3>
<p>▲ Scheduled to Officially Open to Traffic in the Coming Year</p>
<p>▲ Completion of the Anhui Western Transportation Network</p>
<p>Wuhu Communication: Anhui Province's development of commerce and culture has been greatly hindered by traffic congestion in recent years. The inconvenience of military transportation has particularly affected the bandit suppression work. Therefore, officials and the public alike believe that the construction of highways is urgent. The Jing-Wu line is even more pressing because it connects the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Tianjin-Pukou lines. The construction of the Jing-Wu Road has been going on for years, but it was only barely opened from Wuhu to Dangtu last year due to the sluggishness of the project. However, it was not long before the vehicles were suddenly requisitioned and the service was suspended again. It has not been restored until now. Recently, under the supervision of the Anhui Provincial Government and the Tri-Province Bandit Suppression Headquarters, the unfinished projects in Anhui Province were completed day and night. It has now been decided to open to traffic on New Year's Day, 1933. The company contracting the automobile business on the Jing-Wu line is composed of prominent businessmen from Nanjing, Wuhu, and Dangtu. They are currently in the process of signing contracts with the construction departments of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. Therefore, it is a government-supervised, merchant-operated project. It is said that the plan is to establish large stations in Nanjing, Wuhu, and Dangtu, and small stations along the way. The first step is to prepare six passenger cars and four freight cars, and then expand the business as it develops. After the opening of the line, it is expected that it will only take three hours to travel from Wuhu to Beijing. The convenience of transportation in southern Anhui will be far greater than before.</p>
<p>In western Anhui, since the suppression of the communists in the summer, the inconvenience of transportation has greatly affected military and political affairs. After the arrival of Liang Guanying's 25th Route Army, the engineering team of the Social Service Committee was responsible for planning the transportation network of the counties in western Anhui, allocating rear troops and local people to cooperate in the construction. The Shu-Huo Road (Shucheng to Huoshan), 150 li long, started construction at the end of August and was opened to traffic on September 25th. The Tao-San Road (Taoxi Town to Sanhe Town), 60 li long, started construction in mid-October and was completed at the end of October. The Shu-An Road (Shucheng via Tongcheng to Anqing), 250 li long, had the original roadbed mostly built, but the bridges and culverts were not repaired and it has not been opened to traffic. The department sent personnel to repeatedly negotiate with the Anhui Provincial Government. The bridges south of Tongcheng will be repaired by the Construction Department, and temporary bridges will be built north of Tongcheng for temporary traffic. The road was officially opened to traffic on October 25th. The above three lines are all the result of military-civilian cooperation. Zhufou'an, 40 li away from Huoshan, is a producing area of tea, bamboo and timber in western Anhui. The department is now building a branch line directly to Huoshan, which will be completed at the beginning of next month, and uses Maotanchang as the transshipment wharf for tea, bamboo and timber in western Anhui, 35 li away from the Shanwang River in the western section of the Shu-Huo Road. The department is also building a branch line, which can be completed at the beginning of next month. After the completion of the above three roads, transportation in western Anhui can be directly connected to the An-He Road, which will greatly help the development of the rural economy.

<p>Regulations for Jiangsu Province on Conscripting Labor for Dredging Rivers</p>
<h3>Detailed Rules for Implementation Passed by the Provincial Government Meeting</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Communication: The Jiangsu Province Conscription Regulations for Dredging Rivers were previously passed by the Provincial Committee Meeting. Subsequently, the Construction Department, based on the regulations, drafted detailed rules for implementation, which were revised by the Compilation and Review Committee and were also approved by the Provincial Government yesterday. The detailed rules consist of 57 articles, which stipulate in detail the methods for implementing conscripted labor for dredging rivers. The main points are selected as follows: ㈠ All earthwork for dredging rivers included in the conscription plan, such as removing soil from the river and building embankments and roadbeds, shall be carried out by conscripted labor. ㈡ The period for conscripted labor for dredging rivers shall be carried out during the winter and spring seasons when the water dries up and farmers are free from agricultural work, unless otherwise specifically stipulated. ㈢ For rivers to be dredged within the boundaries of each county, the county government shall supervise the Construction Bureau to conduct surveys first in accordance with the standard rules issued by the department, and submit a plan with diagrams, earthwork tables, and explanations for approval. ㈣ Each county shall conscript labor for dredging rivers to a length of 100 to 300 kilometers per year. ㈤ Trunk rivers spanning two or more counties shall be dredged once every five years. Trunk rivers within the county that are related to water conservancy and transportation shall be dredged once every three years, and branch rivers and field ditches shall be dredged once a year. ㈥ Anyone who has already been conscripted for labor in one place in the same year may be exempted from the same type of conscripted labor in other places. ㈦ The working hours are stipulated as eight hours per day. ㈧ Temporarily, cultivated land within 20 li on both sides of the river within the river basin shall be considered within the scope of conscripted labor. ㈨ Tenant farmers shall use the labor force provided by the tenant's household as the standard for distribution. When loans are used instead of labor, they shall be distributed according to the ratio of 60% for the landowner and 40% for the tenant. ㈩ For cultivated land within the river basin, a household with 50 mu of land shall use every 10 mu as a conscription unit (households with one mu or more of self-cultivated land or two mu or more of tenant cultivated land, but less than 10 mu, shall be counted as a unit) to calculate the standard for distributing conscripted labor or loans. (For example, if the total amount of conscripted labor for the benefited cultivated land of a certain river is 5,000 workdays, and there are 500 conscription units, then each unit shall provide two workers. If the total amount of conscripted labor is the same as above, and there are 10,000 conscription units, then every two units shall provide one worker. ㈩㈠ In the river basin, men who are two years or more residents, from the age of 18 to 45, are considered able-bodied men and have the obligation to be conscripted. ㈩㈡ Industries that utilize the river for shipping, salt transport, and commerce shall jointly bear a certain percentage of the total project, the percentage of which shall be temporarily agreed upon by the County River Dredging Association and the relevant agencies and organizations. ㈩㈢ Households with no able-bodied men or with able-bodied men who cannot be conscripted may hire workers to replace them according to the apportioned amount. Industries such as salt affairs, shipping, and commerce, which bear a share of the project, may use cash instead of labor if they are unwilling to provide labor. ㈩㈣ Poor households with no able-bodied men (households with less land than a unit) and poor households with only one able-bodied man who is the sole provider for the family shall be exempted from conscription. ㈩㈤ Poor households in barren areas who are directly affected by floods and have suffered crop failures of 70% or more may be given food rations, with the price not exceeding four dimes per cubic meter, based on the standard of extreme poverty unable to provide for themselves. ㈩㈥ The county government shall dispatch police teams to maintain order in the work area and prevent bandits from mixing in and inciting trouble. Adequate sanitary and medical facilities should be provided. Workers who become ill may stop working, but must make up the work after recovery. If squad and platoon leaders are abusive, they should be reported at any time. ㈩㈦ Industries such as shipping, salt affairs, and commerce that have special relations and voluntarily bear a larger percentage or provide extra labor, and households that have been exempted from labor and voluntarily provide labor for conscription shall be given preferential rewards. Personnel who engage in embezzlement and violate orders shall be severely punished according to law. (November 22nd)</p>

<h3>Letter to the National Merchants from the Association for Upholding the Covenant</h3>
<p>Expression from Over a Hundred Trade Associations</p>
<p>▲Urging National Merchants to Resist Aggression and Save the Nation</p>
<p>▲Every Word a Tear, Dishonest Merchants Should Be Alert</p>
<p>The Association for Upholding the League of Nations Covenant of this city is organized by over a hundred trade associations throughout the city, with the participation of chambers of commerce from all over the country. Its branches are spread throughout the country, making it the most recent national merchant group for saving the nation. The association, in light of the current international situation and the dishonest merchants who are the black sheep and act as accomplices to the enemy, yesterday specially issued a letter to the national merchants, urging them to jointly shoulder the responsibility of resisting aggression and saving the nation. Every word is filled with tears and the language is extremely solemn. The record is as follows: The Eastern Provinces have fallen for a year now. This association silently observes the psychology of most people; those who are cautious and self-preserving only know to worry privately and sigh. Those who are indifferent still manage their own businesses and accumulate wealth. Even the black sheep among them, taking advantage of the opportunity, pursue personal gain and engage in treachery and impropriety without regard. In the past, Han Feizi said, "A thousand miles of stony fields is considered no land; a hundred years of foolish people is considered no people." How true these words are. It is only because of this unmotivated nation that it has invited this great humiliation unprecedented in history. In the past, King Zhuang of Chu warned his people that disaster was imminent. This association, adhering to the teaching of "cultivating oneself deeply and being lenient in blaming others," also solemnly informs our business community of the disaster of the collapse of buildings and the breaking of rafters. Our country has historically had an excess of imports. Last year, the customs deficit reached over 500 million taels. However, of the 900 million taels of our country's exports, the Northeast accounted for one-third. Now that the Eastern Provinces have been occupied, the loss of export trade will be another 320 million taels. Therefore, some people estimate that this year's international trade will have at least a 1 billion taels import surplus, which is 1.4 billion in silver dollars. Therefore, the Northeast is not only the lifeline of our country's politics and international relations, but also the lifeline of commerce. Recently, since the Northeast Customs was occupied and the government moved the tax collection elsewhere, products such as sorghum, silk, medicinal materials, and soybeans are all taxed as foreign goods. Merchants, burdened with extremely heavy taxes, have even burned the sorghum they transported to Shanghai after returning it. The source of soybeans has also come to a standstill, depleting the last drop of their blood. Commercial stagnation is already an obvious sign. The Eastern Provinces have only been occupied for a year. How can we sustain this going forward? Therefore, our merchants should not think that the occupation of the Eastern Provinces is the government's business, and resisting foreign aggression is the business of all citizens. It must be understood that the power of modern economics sometimes dominates politics and international affairs. The reason why the League of Nations is hesitant and cautious is that the world economy has not yet stabilized and is unwilling to take the risk rashly. In other words, only the power of economics can extinguish militarism, and those who hold the source of economics are our merchants. Therefore, merchants will be the first to suffer from the disaster of the fall of the Eastern Provinces, and merchants should also be the first to bear the responsibility of resisting aggression and saving the nation. If we can firmly implement a "clear fields and empty villages" strategy, preventing invading countries from exchanging goods for our money, then their annual trade will be reversed, their budget will be short, and their public debt will increase. Even if they squeeze the farmers to maintain their warmongering life, they will inevitably suffer internal strife and perish like rotten fish. Moreover, there are still over ten thousand volunteer soldiers in the Eastern Provinces competing with them, giving them no time to rest and no appetite to eat. If our business community can tighten their belts, do their best to assist them, and prevent the volunteer soldiers from suffering from lack of clothing and food in the freezing weather, then long-term containment will also be enough to increase their military expenses and disrupt their finances. Do not say that the situation is set and cannot be reversed. It must be understood that success or failure depends on whether our business community makes efforts or not. Therefore, we encourage our fellow merchants to pursue the following five goals: 1. Uphold the League of Nations Covenant; 2. Maintain territorial integrity; 3. Implement economic blockade; 4. Aid the Northeast volunteer army; 5. Sanction ambitious countries that violate the Covenant and world peace. Strive towards these goals and work together, hoping that with the strength of the masses, the broken but precious land can be restored. Let us encourage each other.</p>

<h3>Exposing the Contradictions in the League of Nations Report</h3>
<p>The National Lawyers Association of the Republic of China yesterday telegraphed the League of Nations. The original telegram is recorded below: To Dr. Gu, the Chinese representative in Geneva, forwarded to the representatives of the League of Nations for their consideration. The investigation team's report acknowledges that Manchuria is an integral part of Chinese territory, that the September 18th Incident was a pre-planned act by Japan that exceeded the scope of self-defense, and that the organization of Manchukuo was initiated by the Japanese army and civilian officials, not by the free will of the local people. Then, according to Article 10 of the Covenant, there is no other way to resolve the situation except to restore our country's territorial integrity and administrative independence. However, the recommendations made by the team completely contradict the spirit of the Covenant and the facts it recognizes. The Chinese people who respect the law will never recognize it, and we do not want our country's representatives to participate in the discussion of such illegal recommendations. We dare to ask your representatives to base their recommendations on the aforementioned recognized facts, and to propose recommendations that are in line with the Covenant and international justice.

<h3>Ding Chao and Li Du Telegraph About the Rebellion of the Liran Warship</h3>
<p>▲Killing the Japanese Advisor and Immediately Throwing the Body into the River</p>
<p>▲Unloading a Large Number of Cannons, Guns, Ammunition, and Military Supplies from the Ship</p>
<p>▲Captain Fan Has Great Merit and Should Be Commended by the Central Government</p>
<p>The United Liaison Office of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies stationed in Shanghai yesterday received a telegram from Ding Chao and Li Du regarding the details of the rebellion of the puppet army's Liran warship. The original text of the telegram is as follows: "According to a telegram from Brigade Commander Yongcai stationed in Fuyuan Road (the 21st), at 8:00 PM on the 19th of this month, the puppet army's Liran warship arrived in Tongjiang. Yesterday, it returned to Fuyuan. At 6:00 AM this morning, it suddenly turned back and anchored in Tongjiang. Captain Fan Xuen of the ship stated over the phone that our ship had killed two Japanese advisors and thrown their bodies into the river. Two soldiers on the ship were killed, and over 50 crew members on the ship unanimously revolted, and they requested that your brigade commander take them in and protect them." "I immediately informed Captain Liu of the garrison in Tongjiang over the phone to unload all the military supplies from the ship, and leave the empty ship anchored in the section of the Tongjiang River near Qiqihar Town. At the same time, I ordered Captain Liu to properly deploy defenses in preparation for the enemy. Captain Liu then replied by phone that he had followed the order and coordinated with Captain Fan to carry out the task. A total of two flat-trajectory guns, two heavy mortars, and four machine guns were unloaded, along with tens of thousands of rounds of various bullets. Over fifty naval officers and soldiers, each carrying a Liaoning-made Type 38 rifle, obtained twenty rifles. In addition to Captain Fan of Tongjiang escorting various military equipment to a selected site in Santun, Tongjiang to set up defenses, please give instructions. Just as I was about to send a telegram, another telephone report from Tongjiang stated that Captain Yin arrived in Tongjiang on the Jiangping warship at 6:00 PM this evening. Future developments will be reported in a follow-up telegram. It has been confirmed that the officers and soldiers of the ship were able to kill the Japanese and revolt together, which is rare among the navy and is worthy of admiration. It should be commended or forwarded to the central government for commendation to honor their merits and encourage future generations." "According to this information, Captain Fan Xuen has been in contact with our side for a long time and has long intended to return. This time, he resolutely revolted, demonstrating his deep patriotism and understanding of righteousness. In addition to sending a telegram of commendation and ordering the brigade commander to properly organize and comfort the officers and soldiers of the unit, a special telegram is sent for your information (ten omissions)."</p>
<h3>The National Disaster Relief Association's Stance on the League of Nations</h3>
<p>The National Disaster Relief Association of the Republic of China has recently published its position on the League of Nations investigation report and the resolution of the Eastern Provinces incident, and has also compiled and printed criticisms of the report, which are now on sale. The conclusions are particularly insightful and reasonable, and are specially excerpted below to show the general opinion of the people. The conclusion states: "The content of the report has been reviewed one by one above, and its contradictions and omissions have been pointed out everywhere. Now we want to express to the League of Nations, the people of the world, the government of our country, and the people of the whole country our feelings from all our gains and the opinions formed from our feelings. First, to the League of Nations and the people of the world, the investigation team's report states many facts fairly. Its recommendations are too accommodating to the facts, perhaps because it hopes for peace too eagerly and mediates with painstaking effort. We are also willing to understand, but the report really contains two major shortcomings. Whether these shortcomings are the investigation team's negligence or deliberate evasion, their relationship is very important and makes the report unable to be adopted directly. These are the two shortcomings that the League of Nations and the people of the world who are concerned about resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute must pay attention to. What are they? First, the Eastern Provinces incident is a stage in Japan's policy of aggression, not an accidental event. The source of Japan's policy of aggression is very old. For forty years, it has swallowed Taiwan, cut away the South Manchuria Railway Zone, annexed Korea, leased the Guandong Leased Territory, occupied Qingdao, and coerced the Twenty-One Demands, all in order to expand its territory and promote its rule step by step, in order to dominate all of Asia and dominate the world. This occupation of the Eastern Provinces is just a predetermined step in this consistent policy, not accidental, and will never stop there. Not only are there previous facts that can be ironclad evidence, but Japanese authorities, soldiers, and politicians have either secretly reported to their emperor or announced to their people, and they have not hesitated to say so. Therefore, to ask about the root cause of the Eastern Provinces incident is Japan's policy of aggression. The investigation team described the political development of China and the recent situation of the Eastern Provinces in great detail, believing that it could clarify the background of the Sino-Japanese dispute, and even said that the enthusiasm of anti-foreign propaganda created a special atmosphere at the time of the incident. However, it did not describe the actual situation of Japan's policy of aggression being promoted step by step and the recent aggressive words and actions of Japanese warlords. It did not explore the real core of the problem, but regarded the surrounding results as the cause of the problem, so that those who are concerned about this matter cannot truly understand the origin of the case, and in the future, it will inevitably produce wrong policies. Isn't this a big flaw? Second, the Eastern Provinces incident is the implementation of Japan's policy of aggression, and is by no means a problem of protecting rights and interests. This can be fully proven from the incident itself. The actions of the Japanese army on and after September 18 were by no means self-defense. The Japanese military and political authorities have repeatedly declared that they will not allow the Eastern Provinces to have any political relationship with China again. These are all very clear evidence of the implementation of aggression. Let's not talk too much about it. Let's look at the investigation team's report on Japan's rights and interests in Manchuria, which is not only meticulously maintained, but also expanded and guaranteed in many places. If Japan is really for the protection of rights and interests, it should have been complacent long ago. Why do Japanese authorities scold the report so much and insist on wiping out the entire Chapter Nine and Chapter Ten? It can be seen that Japan wants to annex the Eastern Provinces as a base for dominating all of Asia, which is beyond doubt. Therefore, to resolve the Sino-Japanese Eastern Provinces dispute and maintain permanent peace, the only way is to fundamentally and effectively correct all the actions of Japan that have violated international conventions and arbitrarily carried out aggression, so that it will know that it is difficult to change its traditional policy of aggression. Only then can it be considered resolved. If it is mistaken that Japan is protecting its rights and interests and that it has created the situation in Liaoning through illegal means, even if it does not recognize it all, it recognizes a part of it. Not to mention that Japan is unwilling to accept it because it is against its will, even if it accepts it temporarily, it will know from then on that aggression is effective and that international constraints are ultimately waste paper. It can be more presumptuous and implement its policy of aggression step by step. Where is there any peace to speak of? Where is there any meaning in the existence of the League of Nations? Not only will small and weak countries permanently become the victims of strong countries, but strong countries will also be permanently disturbed by Japan's policy of aggression. This principle is extremely clear, but unfortunately the report and recommendations do not even mention this. Isn't this another big flaw? We believe that for the sake of true world peace, the core of resolving the Eastern Provinces incident lies in curbing Japan's policy of aggression. There is only one way to curb Japan's policy of aggression, which is to absolutely uphold all international conventions and make them fully effective. Therefore, we believe that to resolve the disputes, the following three principles should be strictly followed: 1. The League of Nations should, based on the Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty and the Non-Aggression Treaty, deny all actions taken by Japan in the Eastern Provinces since September 18, and set a time limit for Japan to withdraw its troops to the original stationing points before September 18. 2. Regarding the disputed topics in the Eastern Provinces, after the aforementioned item is implemented, China and Japan should strictly abide by the existing and effective treaties, negotiate a solution, and adjust their disputes. If there is any unresolved dispute, it should be sent to the League of Nations for public judgment. 3. In order to implement the first two principles, the League of Nations should strictly implement the procedures and means stipulated in Article 15 and Article 16 of the League Covenant. Two: To the government and people of our country, our country has joined the League of Nations and shares the great responsibility of maintaining world peace with various countries. Then, in the case of Japan's invasion of the Eastern Provinces, our country's compliance with the Covenant and its appeal to the League of Nations to correct it is our obligation and cannot be said to be wrong. But we should pay close attention to two levels. First, we should strive to maintain true world peace in accordance with the Covenant, but we should not compromise or evade the Covenant, pretend to be peaceful, and suffer useless sacrifices. Second, it is very worrying whether the authority and strength of the League can be fully exerted. We should put this dangerous national situation in our plans and make practical preparations for self-reliance. Therefore, at the upcoming League of Nations General Assembly, we advocate that our country should, based on facts, strongly explain the past, present, and future of Japan's policy of aggression, so that all countries thoroughly understand that there is only one way to maintain permanent peace, that is, to curb Japan's policy of aggression, and resolutely adopt the three principles we have said above and move towards the right path. As for the facts contained in the report, they can be cited as collateral evidence of Japan's aggression everywhere, and the principles it cites can also be adopted as arguments. However, its recommendations, although they feel that the basic heart is commendable, are expedient measures and cannot achieve true peace. This is not to be blindly followed. What we have always been distressed about is that the government, in addition to taking the road of the League of Nations, never makes a painful effort to prepare for self-reliance and self-defense. It must be known that the League of Nations itself has various difficulties. It is feared that it may not be able to take any effective measures against the Eastern Provinces incident. If it is not prepared again, what is the difference between sitting and waiting for death? Preparation should be made from both diplomatic and national defense aspects. Diplomatically, the United Kingdom and the United States may have the possibility of uniting against Japan, and the United States and Russia may also have the possibility of uniting against Japan. It is up to us to clarify the pros and cons, provide guarantees, and take responsibility in order to promote a new situation. We must not sit idly by. As for national defense, it should be jointly undertaken by the national army, with precise deployment and strict array. No need to talk more about it. However, all these methods have one major premise, which is that the whole country must work together. If the government still firmly adheres to the system of refusing people's cooperation, and the party monopolizes power, and the people still scatter and retain the mind of not being responsible, then everything that is said is completely nonsense. We do not believe that there is a government that wishes to perish the country, and we do not believe that there are people who wish to perish the country. Everyone, wake up quickly and cooperate quickly." (The whole book is distributed by Huatong, Dadong, and other bookstores.)</p>

<h3>Full Text of Appeal to the International Community (Continued)</h3>
<p>㈡ Japan's Brutality in Invading China and its Disguises: The Sino-Japanese War of 1894 (1894). Japan declared war on China, plundered land and money, and forced China to sign various unequal treaties. Since then, its aggression against China has become increasingly blatant. Nothing better demonstrates its ambition than the Twenty-One Demands, which it forced Yuan Shikai to recognize in 1915, taking advantage of the raging European War. According to this treaty, China was virtually turned into a Japanese dependency. This is a humiliation that all Chinese people feel deeply ashamed of, and a plan that Japan has never forgotten. Later, the document presented by Tanaka to the Japanese Emperor stated even more clearly that "to conquer the world, we must first conquer China." The September 18th and January 28th Incidents were in fact the implementation of Tanaka's established policy by stubborn Japanese soldiers. Later, Japan sent troops to Jinan, assassinated General Zhang Zuolin, and its desire to annex China became increasingly rampant. During the September 18th Incident, the Japanese army, under the pretext of self-defense, occupied the three northeastern provinces, and then established a state entirely under its control, openly recognizing it in defiance of the world. Can this be called self-defense? Later, it attacked Shanghai without cause, turning the prosperous city in the East into a ghost town. Is this what is meant by self-defense? In total, in the past year, Japan has massacred more than 20,000 Chinese people and destroyed more than 300 billion in property in China. Can such inhumane behavior be called self-defense? In order to disguise its great injustice in establishing the puppet state of Manchukuo, Japan has been propagating to the international community that it is based on the voluntary organization of the people of Manchuria. However, the fact that the volunteer armies in various parts of Manchuria have been resisting automatically for a long time since September 18th is not enough to show the will of the people and reality? This further shows that its disguising words are far from the truth. However, Japan is known to the world for its ability to create rumors and deceive. Therefore, it either calls China an unorganized country, or calls the Soviet movement in China developing, or calls China's boycott of Japanese goods a boycott of foreigners, or says that Japan has an overpopulation and must immigrate. There are endless kinds of disguising propaganda. However, the increasingly organized nature of Chinese politics is an undeniable fact, and it is Japan's imperialist policy that is destroying China's organization. Moreover, assassinations in Japan are endless. How can it claim to be an organized country? Furthermore, the development of communism in China is the result of Japanese aggression. The aggression of Japanese imperialism has bankrupted the majority of the people, made it difficult for China to industrialize, unable to absorb the majority of the poor, and made China's politics unstable, unable to regulate the turmoil of the poor. Japanese imperialism simply refuses to reflect. As for the Chinese people's boycott of Japanese goods, it is an unavoidable punishment for the banditry of Japan. Moreover, this is also a right of conscience for the Chinese people. The Chinese people have never abused this power to other friendly countries. Only to the aggressive Japan is a considerable restraint imposed. People all over the world know the reason for this. In addition, a few Japanese militarists want to cover up their aggression with the pretext of overpopulation, which is even more laborious and clumsy. Even insightful people in Japan recognize this as a kind of unfounded lie. Ironclad statistics prove that the recent population growth rate in Japan has not increased more than before Japan invaded China. Not only that, but Hokkaido in Japan, and Korea and Taiwan, which were seized from China, are also enough to accommodate a large number of people. However, the so-called overpopulation is just a talisman for aggression and an excuse for annexing China's territory. Japanese imperialists have repeatedly declared to the world, "We have no territorial ambitions towards China." However, Japan's actions are always contrary to its promises. What Japan denies is actually its greatest goal. If there is no territorial ambition, why are tens of thousands of troops still stationed in Manchuria? Although the Chinese people are a peace-loving nation, this does not mean that they will not restrain aggressors. The 19th Route Army resisted the 100,000 Japanese troops with 30,000 troops for nearly two months. Finally, out of consideration for the overall situation in the world, it voluntarily withdrew. This alone is enough to prove that Japan's aggression only increases the resistance of the Chinese people. The recent resistance of the volunteer army has not been deterred by Japanese airplanes and poison gas. It can be seen that Japan's ambition to conquer China only increases the contempt and anger of people around the world. ㈢ Regarding the Report of the League of Nations Investigation Commission: The League of Nations Investigation Commission spent several months investigating the dispute between China and Japan. Its hard work is something we are grateful for. In particular, its respect for the Kellogg-Briand Pact in the report and the confirmation of the atrocities of September 18th and the creation of the puppet state, which violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, can prove that the views held by the Investigation Commission are fair and do not go against the original intention of the League of Nations itself to uphold peace. However, its upholding of peace has not achieved its purpose, and its recommendations are beyond our expectations, which cannot but make us regret the Investigation Commission. Japanese aggressors are dissatisfied with the report because it did not fully support Japan's aggression, and what we are dissatisfied with is that it failed to properly fulfill its mission, and it is still too biased towards the aggressors. First, the Investigation Commission believes that the Chinese people's boycott of Japanese goods is an illegal action and an organized behavior. However, it is not known that it is human nature for a weak country to deeply hate and avoid dealing with the strong and violent, and it is also a means of last resort. No one may interfere with it. As for the so-called organization, it is nothing more than the expression of the entire Chinese people's hatred of the Japanese invasion. Secondly, the Investigation Commission believes that Manchuria should be governed by the international community, leaving only China with a nominal sovereignty. We certainly do not reject China's development and the cooperation of friendly countries. However, this should maintain China's sovereignty in order to prevent endless disputes. After all, the majority of the people in Manchuria are Chinese, and China has the greatest interest there, and it is China's lifeline. China will inevitably maintain its sovereignty, and with the considerable cooperation of various friendly countries, it can unleash the wealth of Manchuria, and the people will also understand this kind of assistance in jointly developing Manchuria. If a so-called advisory council is established to govern Manchuria, then it is feared that the residents there will all feel the pain of national subjugation and will not welcome this new regime, which will only give Japan the greatest opportunity for aggression. Moreover, once this bad precedent is set, it will be tantamount to encouraging the atrocities of aggression. If a country forcefully seizes the land of another country and is not subject to the constraints of the covenant, then it is feared that this kind of behavior will occur more and more, and the future of world peace will be bleak. In summary, the recommendations of the Investigation Commission are tantamount to fundamentally recognizing Japan's past behavior as legitimate, recognizing that Japan has special privileges to invade China, and recognizing the validity of the Twenty-One Demands. This is something that the people of the whole country cannot recognize even if they die ten thousand times. Secondly, they want to replace Japan's monopoly with international co-management. This is also no different from giving Japan the convenience of aggression, and allowing Japan to occupy the largest majority in the advisory council. Such an advisory council is nothing more than Japan's puppet. Various countries have not gained the actual benefits of developing Manchuria, but have helped Japan's aggression. This is the second thing we deeply doubt about the Investigation Commission. The Investigation Commission has a fundamental prejudice, believing that it is impossible to restore the original state of September 18th, and believing that a country's invasion of another country can be recognized as legitimate. Then the weak countries of the world have no guarantee, and the crisis of peace will increase day by day. As for saying that the Manchurian Incident is not an act of aggression by one country against the territory of another country, then the Investigation Commission cannot but be self-contradictory. If Japan's military action cannot be called self-defense, nor is it aggression, then what is it? This is the third thing that the Investigation Commission has failed to make a judgment based on facts. As for whether the various recommendations are beyond the responsibility of the Investigation Commission, we do not want to discuss them in detail. After all, if the recommendations can be fair, they still have great value. If they lose their fairness, even the report is not acceptable. However, the recommendations of the Investigation Commission are feared to only make the arrogance of aggression grow day by day. This is the fourth thing we are uneasy about the report.</p>
<p>㈣ Our Hope for the International Community: Since the Japanese atrocities of September 18th, the Chinese government has been almost without resistance so far. The superficial diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not been severed. This is entirely due to the trust in the League of Nations that it will eventually maintain the sanctity of its covenant and exercise its powers. The people of the country are even more looking forward to the League of Nations Investigation Commission's report after its publication, expressing a very clear judgment internationally and obtaining a just solution. However, because its recommendations have reasons that cannot but make us regret, we feel that the League of Nations Investigation Commission has failed to understand the national character of China in history and the spirit of unity and resolute resistance of the Chinese people. Although the Chinese people have always loved peace, whenever they encounter foreign aggression to an intolerable degree, they will rise up to resist and persevere. Past events are all there, and they are clearly visible. At present, stimulated by Japan's continued violence and aggression, the degree of enthusiasm of the people of the whole country for united resistance is based on the aggressive behavior of the other party, and it increases with the passage of time. All industrial and commercial enterprises within China are affected by this. Other unexpected events and future troubles are still beyond expectation, and they are all caused by Japanese aggression. That is, the various friendly countries and the League of Nations Conference should bear the responsibility and obligation to effectively maintain the covenant and exercise their powers. This is something that we hope from the international community and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>㈤ Conclusion: Therefore, what hinders China's development is Japanese aggression. What has a conspiracy to disrupt the world and threatens world peace is Japanese aggression. Japan has created rumors, saying that the state of Manchukuo is the will of millions of people. In fact, even in Japan, insightful people recognize that Japan's aggressive behavior is inappropriate. However, a few ambitious militarists are arrogant and intend to disrupt peace without scruples. People all over the world, if they want to maintain the peace and happiness of East Asia with the highest justice, should jointly sanction Japan's aggressive behavior and support China's national movement. This kind of movement is the foundation of modern civilization. The Chinese people will welcome the friendly cooperation of various countries and work together to build a new Manchuria and the whole of China. If this is not done, or Japan's unlimited aggression is tolerated, or the bad precedent of co-management is opened up, it will not only be the greatest imprudence, but also the cause of the world's greatest misfortune.

<h3>Today, 4 Million Silver Dollars Are Shipped to the Northeast</h3>
<p>▲ Loaded Four Times in Twenty Days</p>
<p>▲ The Total Amount is 12 Million</p>
<p>Recently, cash has been shipped from Shanghai to the Northeast. More than 8 million yuan has been loaded in the past two weeks, and today there is another large batch of 4 million silver dollars, which will continue to be shipped to Fengtian. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Amount Reported for Shipment: Today's large amount of silver dollars shipped from Shanghai to the Northeast is the fourth batch of exports, totaling 818 boxes, totaling 4,090,000 yuan. Among them, 3,895,000 yuan will be transferred to Fengtian after arriving in Dalian, and another 145,000 yuan will be directly transported to Niuzhuang. Nanrongji in this port reported loading 1,505,000 yuan, Dongshunji reported loading 790,000 yuan, Yongfengli 550,000 yuan, Tongshilong 270,000 yuan, Yishunheng 320,000 yuan, Beihengyi 250,000 yuan, Dongxingcheng Dachanglong 100,000 yuan each, Tiandexiang 60,000 yuan, Bank of China 125,000 yuan, and Dongshunji 20,000 yuan to Yingkou, all loaded on British ships this morning and left Shanghai.</p>
<p>There is still more to come: It has been found that since the 5th of this month, the shipment of silver dollars to the Northeast has started. The first shipment was 1,780,000 yuan, the second shipment was on the 15th, totaling 3,510,000 yuan, and the third shipment was on the 19th, totaling 3,000,000 yuan. Including today's batch, more than 12,000,000 yuan has been shipped in the past 20 days. Nine out of ten shipments were to Fengtian, and only a small part was to Yingkou. It is also heard that there will be a fifth batch of cash shipped to the Northeast within this month, and the amount is also around 3,000,000 yuan. Various customs declaration companies will have to wait until today's batch leaves Shanghai before reporting the shipment. It is also heard that Japanese ships have shipped cash to the Northeast many times, but the amount is not as large.</p>
<p>Northeast Finance: Since our country sealed off the Northeast on September 25th, the people of the country have stopped purchasing miscellaneous grains, soybeans, and oil from the Northeast. In theory, there is no need to transport these millions of national currencies to Fengtian. However, according to those who came to Shanghai from the Northeast, after the Japanese forcibly occupied our Northeast, they embraced the heart of scraping and looting, so they confiscated the cash of various official silver and money institutions in the Northeast. The amount shipped to Japan is more than tens of millions of yuan. Recently, they have even forced the people of the Northeast to use Japanese banknotes, and restricted the use of banknotes from our country's various banks, which is extremely strict. Therefore, various banks have come to the country to transport huge amounts of cash to prepare for the redemption of banknotes.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Incident</h3>
<p>Board of Directors Discusses Debt Restructuring: According to the Central News Agency, the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company held its third regular meeting yesterday afternoon at around 4 pm. The attendees were Liu Hongsheng, Ye Zhuotang, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Shouyong, Zhang Jia'ao, Du Yong, and Yang Ying, seven directors, and Hu Bijiang, Li Ming, Qian Yongming, Hu Yunzhuang, and Sheng Shengyi, five directors. Shi Liangcai chaired the meeting, which adjourned at 6 pm. According to reporters, the most important thing was to discuss the organizational regulations of the Debt Restructuring Committee. As for the date of establishment and the selection of committee members, Zhang Shouyong, the managing director, said after the meeting that the establishment date was set within this week. In addition to Qian Yongming and Li Ming, the drafters of the regulations, the remaining members will be discussed further today before a decision can be made. There will be a total of seven standing committee members, and lawyers and accountants will also be invited to participate. The amendments to the organizational regulations will also need to be reorganized. Chen Weiqing, the chief of the general affairs department of the company, told reporters that the total debt of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is currently known to be more than 19 million taels. As for the details, only one or two key personnel know them clearly. Therefore, after the establishment of the Debt Restructuring Committee, it is necessary to conduct a detailed investigation first before proceeding with the discussion of various restructuring methods.</p>
<p>Managers Take Photos to Preserve Evidence: According to the Daily News, Li Guojie, the former manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, mortgaged 30 million yuan to the American business company Guo Yingye and the Dalai Shipping Company. The company first handed over 700,000 yuan to Li Guojie. Li Guojie tried his best to shirk the responsibility, saying that the money was accepted by Chen Banmu, the former supervisor of the company. However, after the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company actively investigated, Li Guojie's fraud was completely exposed. According to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the China Business Operations Company obtained several receipts that Li Guojie had actually received. The receipts had five seals, namely the seal of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the seal of the Board of Directors, the seal of the Chairman of the Board, the seal of the General Manager, and Li Guojie's personal seal. In addition to the two public seals of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Board of Directors, Li Guojie concurrently served as the chairman of the board and the general manager. Therefore, the receipts were handled entirely by Li Guojie. According to the Daily News reporter, the receipts have been photographed by the General Manager's Office and submitted to the Ministry for review.</p>
<p>Will Chen Fumu Return to China as Scheduled? The Minister of Transportation, Zhu Jiahua, repeatedly telegraphed Chen Fumu to Beijing, instructing him to report to the Central Government on the process of mortgaging the four wharves to foreign companies. However, Chen had already gone to Hong Kong in advance. A few days ago, he telegraphed Minister Zhu twice from Hong Kong, stating that borrowing money from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was a common practice and did not require prior approval from the Ministry of Transportation. He, as the supervisor, had the power to approve it, and the mortgage had been agreed upon long ago, only signed recently, and the 85% of the funds transferred did not harm the rights of others. He showed defiance towards the government. Therefore, the court has now issued a summons, instructing him to appear in court for questioning. If he does not return to China within the time limit, the National Government will order his arrest. As for Chen's party membership, it will also be proposed for expulsion at the Third Plenary Session next month as a warning.</p>
<p>Another Ship Added to the Sino-European Route</p>
<h3>A Giant of 24,000 Tons from a French Company</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this month, the new postal ship "Contessa Vittoria" of the Italian company came to China and joined the Sino-European route. It takes 23 days from Shanghai to Italy. This ship can be called the champion of the Sino-European route. Recently, it was heard that the new postal ship "Atsmia" of the French company, with a load of 24,000 tons, will arrive in Shanghai from France this week (i.e., the 26th) and go to Japan next week. After returning to Shanghai, it is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 3rd of next month for its maiden voyage to Marseille. It is also heard that the previous voyage of the "Messagerie" ship "Angoulême" from France to China, for some reason, stopped at Saigon, and all passengers and cargo destined for China were transferred to the new ship.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Plummet and Shuang Gong Silk Factory Announces Closure</h3>
<p>▲ European and American Market Prices Plunge and No One Advises</p>
<p>▲ Inventory Piles Up and Temporarily Suspended to Await a Turnaround</p>
<p>The Shuang Gong Silk Factory in this city has recently seen a sharp decline in sales in the European and American markets, resulting in a buildup of inventory. The Fulun and Honglun factories, which have been struggling to maintain operations, announced their closure yesterday to wait for an opportunity. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Difficult to Maintain: There are only seven Shuang Gong Silk Factories in the country, including Fulun in Shanghai. Their business has been in a slump for many years and has reached its limit. Sales in Europe and America have disappeared, and they have been forced to close down one after another. Only the Fulun Shuang Gong Factory at the end of Tianbao Road in Hongkou, with 216 machines, and the Honglun Shuang Gong Factory on Liuying Road in Zhabei, with 204 machines, have been struggling to maintain operations to maintain the livelihood of the workers.</p>
<p>Complete Closure: Recently, due to the continued poor business, the sharp drop in prices in the European and American markets, no one advises, the inventory piles up, and the turnover is not smooth, the Fulun and Honglun factories, which have been struggling to maintain operations since yesterday, have also announced their closure to wait for an opportunity. According to the manager of the factory, there are only two Shuang Gong Silk Factories operating in the city. Recently, the sales of foreign firms have dropped by 50 taels per dan, and there have been no transactions. The price difference is more than 200 taels compared to the previous price, and the cost per dan is huge at the current market price. Moreover, the inventory is piling up, and the closure has been announced.</p>
<h3>Pork Industry Opposes the Jiangsu Finance Department's Collection of Pork Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Representatives Sent to Shanghai to Form a Joint Office</p>
<p>▲ Telegrams to the Central Departments, Provincial Governments, and Requesting Explicit Orders for Abolition</p>
<p>The fresh pork industry in various counties north of the Yangtze River previously reported that the business tax bureaus of Tongzhou, Rugao, Jingjiang, and Taixing counties had illegally collected pork export taxes at the ports along the river in each county, and had repeatedly telegraphed the relevant departments and provincial governments requesting a ban. Representatives were elected to go to Beijing and the provinces to petition, and the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Provincial Government approved the abolition. This matter has come to an end. However, the Department of Finance has now changed the name and appointed Lou Fumin as the Pork Tax Commissioner of Tong, Ru, Tai, and Jing, imitating the previous method of unified pork tax in northern Jiangsu, and scheduled to start collecting taxes on the 25th of this month. The pork butchers in each county believe that this tax is completely a lijin tax, which violates the central government's legal determination to abolish lijin, and they cannot afford it. They have sent representatives to Shanghai to organize a joint office to handle opposition matters. Yesterday, they telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Provincial Government, and Department of Finance, requesting a swift order for abolition. The telegram reads: To the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, the business tax bureaus of Tong, Ru, Jing, and Tai counties in Jiangsu Province set up checkpoints along the river and collected two jiao per pig, which is a heavy tax and causes great trouble to merchants. Petitions were filed separately, and the Yuan, Ministry, and Department issued explicit orders for abolition. The pain of the merchants has not been eliminated, and unexpected disasters have come again. The Department of Finance has appointed Lou Fumin as the Pork Tax Commissioner of Tong, Ru, Tai, and Jing, setting up offices and bureaus, which is a more severe approach. Its method is no different from the central government's explicit order to abolish lijin. It undermines the credibility of the central government and increases the suffering of merchants. We earnestly request the Yuan, Ministry, and Department to quickly issue an order for abolition to relieve the merchants from their suffering. We await orders in great haste.</p>

Now that everything has been concluded, all income and expenditure accounts have been checked by accountant Xu Yongzuo. We will submit all the documents for your review to verify the facts.

<p>Japanese Minister Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<h3>No Intention to Go to Beijing at Present</h3>
<p>The Japanese Minister to China, Akira Ariyoshi, returned to Shanghai on the Chichibu Maru at 9:15 yesterday morning. After arriving in Shanghai, Minister Ariyoshi made a statement, saying that he had discussed the outline of Sino-Japanese relations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. He had not heard of the proposal to establish an international committee to resolve the Manchurian issue. While in Tokyo, he also discussed the issue of road construction beyond the Shanghai Public Concession, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not give any instructions on this issue. He has no intention to go to Beijing at present, but if necessary, he will go to Beijing.</p>
<p>Opposition to Telephone Price Increase Becomes More Serious</p>
<h3>Over 600 More Lines Disconnected</h3>
<p>User Association's Attitude: On the issue of the Shanghai Special District's telephone price increase, the telephone company has expressed a firm stance, with no room for compromise or hesitation. Therefore, 570 lines have already been disconnected. Although 200 customers continued to pay and had their lines reconnected, according to a recent survey by the Telephone User Association, as of yesterday, the telephone company continued to disconnect lines, reaching over 100-200 in the Central District and over 400 in the New Central District. Therefore, the situation is becoming more serious. It is reported that the User Association is determined to confront the company, vowing not to yield, and preparing for major sacrifices, while waiting for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the American Minister to order the company to cancel the price increase.</p>
<p>Taxpayers Association Sends Another Letter: The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, according to Shao Renhua (telephone number 4408) in his letter, the telephone price increase issue requires an urgent return to communication. We should write another letter to Mr. Zhong and Mr. He of the Public Concession Public Works Department, urging the company to reconnect first and wait for a solution. Otherwise, not only will deductions be made on a daily basis, but compensation for losses must be heard to be fair. As for the general discussion of the company's position, without clarifying its capital, the amount of goods purchased, equipment expenditures, whether there is any excess, the breadth of the site, and the war losses, regardless of the year, completely requiring existing users to make up for it, how can there be such a reason in the world, etc. Based on this, we request that you investigate and handle the matter as soon as possible." Addressed to the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Machine Factory's Three Reasons: The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Association, regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company's increase in telephone fees by 33%, presented three reasons in a letter to the Public Concession Public Works Department for reply, stating:</p>
<p>British Residents Association Annual Meeting</p>
<h3>Secret Content Worth Noting</h3>
<p>The British Residents Association of this port held its annual meeting at the Westerners' Race Club. The content of the discussion was quite secretive.

<h3>American Consul General Sends Personnel to Visit the Fisheries Guidance Center</h3>
<p>The fisheries of the United States, bordering the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Pacific Ocean and Alaska to the west, are particularly famous in the world. The number of salted and fresh fish and canned aquatic products transported and sold to China each year is very large. Yesterday, the Consul General of the United States in Shanghai, in order to learn more about the types, production volume, value, market, and sales conditions of coastal fish products in various provinces of China, as well as the types and names of fishing boats and fishing gear, specially sent staff member Cao Huimin to the Shanghai Municipal Fisheries Guidance Center in Xiaodongmen to investigate everything and visit various models of fishing boats and fishing gear, as well as specimens of aquatic organisms. Technician Wang Defa of the center received him, answered various inquiries, agreed to assist in the investigation of the general situation of China's fisheries, and discussed the exchange of publications with the US fisheries authorities in the future. The results were quite satisfactory.</p>

<h3>Two Cuban Youths' Roaming Feat 37,000 Miles of Car Travel</h3>
<p>▲Interesting Tea Party at the American Trading Company Yesterday</p>
<p>Two young men named Bairdi and Bieteira from Cuba, in the prime of their lives, held great ambitions. Last autumn, they drove a Ford car to roam across the United States, starting from Boston, passing through Mexico and Canada, spending ten months, covering a distance of 37,000 miles. They visited almost all the major cities in the 49 states of the United States. Newspapers competed to report their stories, and the automotive industry considered it a beautiful tale. Now, Bairdi and Bieteira have brought their Ford roadster, which has accompanied them on their long journey, to Shanghai for sightseeing. Mr. Bowen, manager of the American Trading Company on Avenue Foch, held a tea party in the company's showroom at 5 p.m. yesterday to show his hospitality and invite Chinese and Western reporters from Shanghai to participate. In addition to displaying the Model A Ford car they drove (see picture), there were also photos taken along the way, newspaper articles, and a map of the itinerary, arranged around for viewing. The car was decorated with badges and flags, almost full, all of which were presented by public and private institutions in various places as proof of their journey. Bairdi and Bieteira gave explanations, which were very interesting. They said that since the departure, the climate and conditions in various places they passed through were different. The heat in Mexico and the cold in Canada differed by more than 100 degrees. In Canada, the road was covered with silver snow, endless white, and the wheels were trapped in the snow, making it difficult to walk. Fortunately, the Ford car was well-made and advanced all the way, with no mechanical difficulties. Bairdi and Bieteira arrived in Vancouver at the end of July this year, then took a boat to Japan, toured the three islands, and traveled through Korea, the three northeastern provinces, Peiping, Tianjin, Nanking, Hankow, etc., to Shanghai. The car they drove had been used briefly ▲Running 37,000 miles ▲</p>
<p>in Shanghai, but in other places, due to road conditions, they were unable to enjoy the driving pleasure. They may try it again in the future.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning, a Policeman in Nanshi Died While Chasing a Thief Who Robbed Gold Jewelry</h3>
<p>▲Ms. Zeng Wang's Gold Necklace Was Robbed</p>
<p>▲The Policeman Held the Thief in His Arms</p>
<p>▲The Thief Urgently Opened Fire on the Police</p>
<p>▲Officer Lu Died in the Hospital Due to Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, in the territory of the Second Precinct of the First District of Nanshi, a thief robbed a woman's gold jewelry. A policeman bravely chased after the thief and was shot in the abdomen, a vital area, by the thief. He died in the hospital in the afternoon. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Woman Robbed on the Way: Ms. Zeng Wang, a local woman, 44 years old, residing at No. 17 Yongze Lane, Guangqi Road, went to buy pig's head meat near Fu Jia Lane at around 9 a.m. yesterday. Unexpectedly, on the way, two robbers suddenly appeared, one wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, and the other wearing a black cloth shirt and pants, blocking her way and threatening her with a gun, forbidding her to make a sound. Ms. Zeng Wang, seeing the situation, knew she had encountered robbers, and was immediately terrified, standing motionless like a wooden chicken. The robbers snatched a gold necklace (worth over one hundred yuan) from her neck and fled separately with the stolen goods. One of the robbers, wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, turned from Shengjia Lane into Sanpailou and fled.</p>
<p>Policeman Hugged the Thief: At the same time, Lu Chunshan, a policeman from the Second Precinct of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was going to Sanpailou to relieve Wang Jincai, the guard on duty at the third post. At that time, while passing by the entrance of Guanyitong Lane, he suddenly saw a robber wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, looking flustered, running from afar, and after being pointed out by passers-by that the person was indeed a robber, Officer Lu immediately went forward and hugged the robber around the waist.</p>
<p>Officer Lu Shot in the Abdomen: The thief, realizing that things were not going well, activated the mechanism of the pistol he was holding and fired two shots. Officer Lu was shot in the lower right abdomen. The thief took the opportunity to struggle free, took steps to escape again, and continued to fire shots backward. Although Officer Lu was injured, he still drew his gun and fired back, and bravely chased after him. However, due to the vital injury and the continuous flow of blood, he fell to the ground after only a few steps.</p>
<p>The Robber Escaped on the Spot: At that time, Wang Jincai, the guard on duty at the nearby third post, also heard the alarm and rushed over. Seeing the thief still running wildly ahead, he also tried to catch up. The thief, in a desperate situation, ran into the back door of the Dai Chunlin Perfume Shop, then rushed out of the front door, went straight to Yimiao Avenue, and then turned into the gate of Yimiao. When Officer Wang tracked him down, there were crowded tourists in the temple and the thief had disappeared.</p>
<p>More Than a Dozen Holes in the Intestines: Soon, the news spread, and the patrol officer led Chief Li and others to search everywhere. In the meantime, the injured policeman Lu Chunshan was sent to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. After being examined by the doctor, it was said that Officer Lu was shot in the abdomen, and the small and large intestines were pierced by the bullet, resulting in a dozen holes. The bullet did not pass through, and his life was in danger.</p>
<p>Died of Serious Injuries in the Afternoon: The doctor used X-rays to find no trace. Officer Lu was already in a coma and the situation was very dangerous. Director Xu then submitted a request to Director Wen for medical expenses. Unexpectedly, at 5:50 p.m., Officer Lu died of his injuries. Officer Lu was 25 years old, from Hubei, and had served in the Second Precinct of the First District for two years. He was usually very diligent and cautious, and was praised by successive directors. Officer Lu's family still has an elderly mother, a widow, and young children. He was poor after his death. In addition to preparing a coffin, he has submitted a request to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to consider Officer Lu's death in the line of duty and provide preferential treatment. The funeral is scheduled for 2 p.m. today, and all precincts will attend.</p>
<h3>Bandits Extort 20,000 Yuan, Threatening Arson</h3>
<p>▲The Contact Person Must Wear a Knotted Satin Hat</p>
<p>▲And Must Hold a Red Paper Package as a Sign</p>
<p>▲Detectives Ambush as Agreed</p>
<p>▲Lu Jiangshun, Liu Ruiyan, and Others Were Arrested</p>
<p>Huang Zhangfa, a Cantonese, lives at No. 2, Baolean Road, North Sichuan Road. He works at the Gold Exchange and has accumulated some savings. Recently, he was coveted by bandits. From the 27th of last month to the 22nd of this month, he suddenly received four threatening letters, extorting 30,000 yuan. Huang reported the case to the Disraeli Road Police Station, but no arrest was made. A letter came again the other day, saying that if he continued to ignore them, they would set his house on fire. They requested that at around 1 p.m., someone be sent to the vicinity of the Yunji Hotel at the corner of Guangdong Road and Fujian Road to make contact. The person must wear a knotted satin hat and hold a red paper package as a sign, otherwise they would take drastic measures. Huang was shocked and immediately reported to the police station. The chief sent Detective Mao Yiwen, a Chinese detective, and all the detectives disguised as vendors, along with Huang's representative, Mr. A, dressed as instructed, and went to the agreed location to wait, while other detectives ambushed in all directions to observe the situation. After a while, Lu Jiangshun (25 years old) and Liu Ruiyan (36 years old), both from Tongzhou, arrived leisurely and wandered near the hotel. Suddenly, they saw Huang's representative and went up to ask, "Are you sent by Mr. Huang?" Mr. A said yes. Chen and Liu said that this was not the place to talk and asked him to go to the Great World. Mr. A pretended to agree and nodded frequently. Detective Mao and others of the police station rushed out and arrested Chen and Liu and took them back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated the previous events and said that the two defendants admitted at the police station that they were sent by three other people to make contact at that location. If they obtained the money, they would be paid 20 yuan each, and they did not know anything else. Today, the victim and the representative at the time were not in court, and all the letters are stored at the police station. Please postpone the case for further investigation. Detective Mao then reported the circumstances of the arrest of the two defendants. Judge Zhao Linyu questioned the two defendants about their age, origin, and occupation. According to Daoxian, they were rickshaw pullers, and the remaining statements were evasive. The judge ordered them to be returned to custody and rescheduled for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Old Wife Not Dead, Young Beauty Departs</h3>
<p>▲ Mao Lianqing Accused of Fraud, Rape</p>
<p>▲ Abandoned After One Year of Cohabitation</p>
<p>▲ Mao Claims Accusations Are Utterly False</p>
<p>▲ Judge Asks for Leave Yesterday, Rescheduling Trial</p>
<p>Mao Lianqing, a Ningbo native and owner of the Mao Jintai Wood Shop at 200 Sichuan Road, is 42 years old. He previously met a local woman, Jiang Ruying, somewhere. Ms. Jiang is 30 years old and of decent appearance. The two immediately took a liking to each other and were mutually attracted. Around the seventh month of the lunar calendar last year, Mao and Ms. Jiang met again at Wing On Company. After talking, their feelings became harmonious, and they went to the Great Eastern Hotel for intimate enjoyment. One night passed quickly, filled with endless romance. The next day, they moved to the New New Hotel and continued to live together. After more than ten days, they built a "golden house" at No. 7 Datong Lane, Baker Road, as a place to keep his beauty. At this time, their love was quite strong and remained so for almost a year without any disagreements. Unexpectedly, recently, for unknown reasons, a storm suddenly arose, and their relationship broke down. Ms. Jiang then hired Zhao Shen and Chen Honglai as lawyers to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Mao Lianqing of fraud, rape, and malicious abandonment. Her complaint stated that the plaintiff, while purchasing clothing and items at Wing On Company around the seventh month of the lunar calendar last year, happened to meet the defendant Mao Lianqing, who used sweet words to seduce her and diligently offered his affections. He then lured her to room 69 of the Great Eastern Hotel and persuaded her in every way to marry him as his second wife, claiming, "Because my old wife is dead, I have long wanted to marry you. I have already asked someone to be a matchmaker and propose to your mother several times, and she has already agreed. They say that as long as you yourself agree, this marriage will be successful. Since we have met in person today, it can be called a heaven-sent marriage, and we don't need them as matchmakers. So today, I must propose to you. Please agree to me in person, and then I will give you this ring as an engagement gift," etc. As the plaintiff is a woman, her will was weak. At the time, she believed in his sincerity, unaware of his deception, and mistakenly believed that a marital relationship had been established. She then expressed her agreement and requested to have the wedding ceremony before cohabitation, but he insisted that he must first cohabitate until he obtained permission from his mother, and then complete the ceremony. Once his mother agreed, they would complete the ceremony and enter the house. For now, they would temporarily form a small family outside for convenience. Thus, both parties agreed, and the defendant gave her a ring as</p>
<p>Proof of Free Marriage. The next day, the defendant booked room 23 of the New New Hotel, and they cohabitated for more than ten days. At this time, the defendant's love for the plaintiff was very strong. On August 14th, he rented the lower wing of No. 7 Datong Lane, Baker Road, and formally cohabitated. Because the plaintiff was already pregnant, both parties agreed on the plaintiff's living expenses. The defendant admitted to paying 150 yuan per month, which he would pay forever without interruption. For several months, the defendant fulfilled the verbal agreement. Unexpectedly, starting from the end of February this year, for some unknown reason,</p>
<p>The Defendant Stopped Cohabitating, And the Agreed Living Expenses Were Also Not Paid. The plaintiff's private savings were also exhausted, leaving her in a difficult situation and struggling to make a living. On May 20th, the plaintiff's mother asked the defendant for expenses, and he only gave 60 yuan. On June 1st, the plaintiff was admitted to Guangren Hospital for childbirth and gave birth to a son. All medical and recuperation expenses were needed, so she repeatedly sent people to report to the defendant and asked him to pay the expenses. Not only did he disappear and not come to cohabitate, but he also did not give any money. Therefore, after searching everywhere, she finally learned that the defendant's so-called deceased old wife was still alive.</p>
<p>Such a Beginning and Abandonment, Playing with Women, Disregarding the Livelihood of the Plaintiff and Her Son, Thinking of the Future, the Pain is Extreme, (omitted). Based on the above circumstances, the defendant has clearly committed crimes under Articles 244 and 310, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and should be ordered to appear in court to be punished accordingly, and file an incidental civil lawsuit, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay: (1) 55,500 yuan for the plaintiff's support (calculated at 150 yuan per month, from March of this year to the end of the year when she turns 60); (2) 12,000 yuan for the child's support (50 yuan per month, from June of this year until he turns 20); (3) 3,220 yuan for the child's education expenses (calculated at 100 yuan per year for elementary school from age 7 to 13, but calculated at 360 yuan per year for middle school from age 14 to 20), totaling</p>
<p>70,700 Yuan. Hoping that the court will order the defendant to pay it all at once to punish the unlawful and save women and children, etc. The court approved the complaint and ordered Chinese constable Guo Xiangyao to notify both the plaintiff and defendant to appear in court for questioning. Yesterday afternoon, the scheduled date for the trial arrived. The plaintiff, Mao Jiang Ruying, arrived in court with her lawyer Chen Honglai, while the defendant Mao Lianqing hired lawyer Dai Jien to appear in court, stating that all the plaintiff's accusations were completely false and that the truth would eventually come to light. Later, because the presiding judge Wu Zhen asked for leave due to a matter, the case could not proceed and was rescheduled for the afternoon of the 30th of this month.</p>

<p>Pudong Electricity Fee Continues to Be Reduced</p>
<h3>Implemented from January 1st Next Year</h3>
<p>The electricity price of the Pudong Electric Company was originally 25 cents per kilowatt-hour. After repeated urging by the Municipal Public Works Bureau, it was gradually reduced to 22 cents per kilowatt-hour in January of the 19th year. In December of the 20th year, the Public Works Bureau signed a contract with the company, stipulating a method for reducing electricity prices annually. The company first reduced it to 21 cents per kilowatt-hour from January 1st of the 20th year. Now, according to the agreement, starting from January 1st next year, it will be reduced by another cent per kilowatt-hour, only charging 20 cents. The electricity price will also be reduced accordingly: (1) If the average monthly electricity consumption per horsepower is less than 150 kilowatt-hours, it will be reduced to 7 cents per kilowatt-hour; (2) If the average monthly electricity consumption per horsepower exceeds 150 kilowatt-hours but is less than 250 kilowatt-hours, it will be reduced to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour; (3) If the average monthly electricity consumption per horsepower exceeds 250 kilowatt-hours but is less than 350 kilowatt-hours, it will be reduced to 5.6 cents per kilowatt-hour; (4) If the average monthly electricity consumption per horsepower exceeds 350 kilowatt-hours, it will be 4.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. All these reductions will be implemented at the same time as the electricity price reduction. It is reported that it has been submitted to the Public Works Bureau for record, and by then, the electricity price in Pudong will be not much different from that in the western districts.</p>

<p>Second Phase of War Zone Relief Loans to Open Early Next Month</p>
<h3>Total Amount is 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal War Zone Relief Committee, in order to revive the war zone and relieve disaster victims, allocated 250,000 yuan for temporary relief loans in the war zone, to be issued in two phases. The first phase, 100,000 yuan, was opened on the 16th of this month and is about to be completed. Only a small number of borrowers have not collected their loans because the procedures have not been completed. According to the War Zone Temporary Relief Loan Office, there are still more than 30 borrowers in the first phase who have not collected their loans. These more than 30 borrowers have generally failed to complete the procedures such as guarantor, so they have not come to collect the loans. It is now planned to end this at the end of this month. If the registered borrowers still do not collect their loans by then, a few more days will be given. If the borrowers still do not come to collect the loans after the deadline, the first phase of loan coupons that have been issued will be invalidated in order to proceed with the second phase of loans. The remaining funds from the first phase that have not been issued will be transferred to the second phase for issuance, so as to avoid confusion in the procedures. The total amount of the second phase of loans is 100,000 yuan, including 27,000 yuan for poor people's loans (9,000 yuan for Zhabei District, and 3,000 yuan each for Zhenru, Jiangwan, Wusong, Yinhang, Yinxiang, and Pengpu districts), 50,000 yuan for house-building loans (distributed according to the original proportions of each district, including 13,000 yuan each for Zhabei, Wusong, and Jiangwan, 2,500 yuan each for Yinhang and Pengpu, 5,000 yuan for Yinxiang, and 1,000 yuan for Zhenru), 20,500 yuan for small industrial loans (distributed according to the original proportions of each district), and 2,500 yuan for porridge distribution. This money can be allocated at the beginning of next month. Once the funds are allocated, the second phase of loans will begin, around the beginning of next month.</p>

<h3>Chinese Merchants' Electric Tramways Fully Restored Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲ All Tram Lines Operating as Usual</p>
<p>▲ Salary Increase Issue to Be Mediated Today</p>
<p>After the electrical workers of the Chinese Merchants' Electric Company went on strike on the 18th of this month, they accepted the order of the party and government authorities to resume work after repeated orders to resume work. The workers had already accepted the order of the authorities and drove eight trams out of the various lines at 5:00 pm the day before yesterday, operating for one week to indicate the resumption of work. Yesterday morning at 5:00 am, all the workers had arrived at the factory to work, and all the tram lines were operating as usual. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resumption of Work Situation: After the general meeting decided to resume work the day before yesterday, starting at 5:00 am yesterday morning, all tram lines were operating as usual. When resuming work, the director of the transportation department of the company ordered the coppersmiths of the factory to rush to make the keys for the trams. At around 5:00 am, the transportation director Lu Zhonglin used Chen Jinying and others to arrive at the factory one after another to prepare the trams. The workers also arrived at 5:30 am and went to work as usual. At this point, trams on lines 1, 2, 3, and 4 drove out separately and resumed traffic as usual. Each tram was still protected by a member of the police brigade. The order was very good, and no other problems occurred at night.</p>
<p>Mediation Today: After all the workers resumed work and restored traffic, only the salary increase issue that had been appealed for had not been resolved. In order to completely resolve the issue and avoid further incidents, the party and government authorities have scheduled a formal mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 am today, summoning two responsible representatives from both labor and management to the bureau to listen to the formal mediation. It is reported that the Municipal Party Department and the Public Security Bureau will also send personnel to participate in the mediation at that time.</p>
<h3>National Coal Relief Association Asks Central Government to Relieve Chinese-Owned Mines</h3>
<p>The tax rates for various domestic mines are different. The Sino-foreign joint venture Kailuan Coal Mine only pays one customs duty, one penny of Kai Ping silver per ton, and has no other taxes and levies. However, Chinese-owned coal mines, in addition to paying mining area production and sales taxes and customs duties, also pay various local miscellaneous levies. The burden is heavy, the cost increases, the selling price is slightly higher, and sales are stagnant. The rural economy of our country has already gone bankrupt. If the mines are shut down and the national coal production stops, not only will the number of unemployed people increase sharply, but the national income will also decrease sharply. If it is not rescued as soon as possible, the harm is unthinkable. The National Coal Relief Association in this city, in view of the fact that national coal has been hit by the dumping of Japanese coal and is also facing price competition from Kailuan, which has lower costs, the market is even more declining, and the crisis is lurking. It is reported that it has prepared a document to petition the central government to provide relief to various domestic mines so that the Chinese-owned mines that are on the verge of bankruptcy can survive.</p>
<h3>Lin Pengxia Gave a Lecture on Aviation Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ms. Lin Pengxia, our country's first female aviator, whose style name is Xiaochong, is from Putian, Fujian. She studied in the United States and also studied aviation in England for many years, making her the earliest Chinese woman to study aviation. This time, she came to Shanghai from Singapore and plans to go to the Northwest for inspection, determined to develop the Northwest through aviation. After Ms. Lin arrived in Shanghai, people from all walks of life welcomed her with great enthusiasm, and she was very busy with social engagements. Yesterday, at the request of various schools, she gave a lecture on aviation. At 9:00 am, she lectured at the Nanyang Commercial High School on Shanzhong Road. The school's principal Wu Xinglian, Dean of Studies Wu Jiangleng, aviator Huang Heqing, and Xu Tongye, a representative of the Aviation Construction Association, as well as teachers and students of the school, attended. Here is a record of her speech: "Everyone knows that aviation has a major relationship with the country. During this national crisis, to save the country, we must study and promote aviation. After the September 18th and January 28th incidents, the Chinese people felt the need for active aviation construction even more. The invention of aircraft was in 1903 and has only 30 years of history. People at that time did not pay attention to it. It was not until 1913 that European and American countries and Japan began to pay attention to it. After the European War, all countries in the world have strived for aviation construction and adopted it for civilian use to facilitate transportation. Military aircraft are also divided into four types: reconnaissance, bombing, expulsion, and combat. The speed of progress is truly amazing. According to the survey statistics of 1928, there were more than 2,000 aircraft, 3,500 air stations, and more than 30,000 pilots in European and American countries. Looking back at our country, there are only more than 20 aircraft and more than 30 pilots. The difference is too great. Because I felt the need for aviation, I decided to study when I was in England. People in that country were very surprised because I was the first Chinese woman to study aviation. Fortunately, I succeeded in my studies and hope to continue my research. The purpose of this trip back to China is to awaken the Chinese people's attention to aviation. We must know that only aviation can consolidate national defense and protect our territory. At this time when the Japanese bandits are advancing step by step, we cannot sit still and wait for death. We should rise up and strengthen ourselves. As for the purpose of this trip to the Northwest for inspection, it is because the provinces of Qinghai, Ningxia, and Suiyuan in the Northwest are rich in products and have vast wastelands, which foreigners have coveted for a long time. We must immediately find ways to develop them. I am willing to contribute to the Chinese people through aviation, regardless of success or failure. I hope that the Chinese people will work together to make efforts," etc. Yesterday morning at 11:00 am, Ms. Lin also lectured at Qingnian Middle School, at 11:30 am at Baiwen Middle School, Huizhong Middle School, at 3:00 pm at Shanghai Middle School, and Minli Girls' Middle School, and in the evening at Liangjiang Women's Physical Education College, etc. It is reported that she will go to the Northwest in a few days.</p>

<p>Urging Factories to Register by Deadline</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Re-advises Municipal Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government previously instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to handle factory registration in accordance with the Ministry of Industry's request to investigate the situation of various factories in this city. It has been many days, but many factories are still waiting and watching. The Ministry of Industry re-advised the Municipal Government the day before yesterday to expedite the submission of registration forms by the deadline. Therefore, the Municipal Government forwarded the Ministry of Industry's advisory yesterday for compliance. The advisory from the Ministry of Industry is recorded as follows: "Regarding the matter of advising, the Ministry has held factory registration and previously advised your Municipal Government to investigate and instruct the competent authorities to comply and expedite the process of submitting the reports by the deadline, and your Municipal Government was allowed to forward the factories applying for registration to the Ministry for review and separate approval or rejection. However, factory registration focuses on making the situation of factories across the country clear as a whole, without any omissions, so that precise planning can be done to seek the development of industry. Now, it is found that the factories that your city has submitted for registration account for only a small number of the factories in the entire city, so it is difficult to have a comprehensive understanding. Accordingly, we advise you again to investigate and strictly urge and expedite the submission of registration by the deadline for all factories in the city that should be registered, etc."</p>

The letter stated that "Just as the merchants are planning recovery methods, unexpected losses have suddenly increased. How can we bear this in the midst of such great pain and deep wounds?

<h3>Wu Song Electric Light Illumination Postponement</h3>
<p>Wu Song Bao Ming Electric Light Company, during the war, all its routes were completely destroyed by the Japanese army. Even the factory buildings were bombarded by artillery fire and severely damaged, making it unable to recover. It is now operated by the privately-run Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant. Since the plant took over, it has been working actively. Now, all the routes have been installed. For several days, it has been rushing to repair the houses in the square shed and other machine areas, and it has been roughly completed. Once completed, it is estimated that the illumination can begin at the end of the month or the beginning of next month. All the electric light users in the town have also installed the light wires and are eagerly waiting to turn on the power. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works recently sent personnel to Songjiang to inspect the repair work in the factory's machine room, believing it to be unqualified. Because the houses are currently only being repaired, the foundations must not be firm, and there is fear of accidents. All must be rebuilt and the foundations redone before the machines can be installed. Otherwise, the bureau cannot approve the commencement of work. Therefore, the plant's power generation may be delayed, and it will not be able to illuminate for a while.</p>

<h3>Datong Music Society Improves Ordinary Silk and Bamboo Instruments</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Datong Music Society, after manufacturing large instruments and domestic violins, felt that the decline of national music was still due to the poor quality of ordinary instruments. Because of poor quality, the price is low, but the lower the price, the worse the quality. Now, the society believes that to revitalize national music, it is necessary to improve instruments first. Also, because fewer people study ancient music and more people study ordinary silk and bamboo music, the society takes the improvement of silk and bamboo instruments as a prerequisite. The improved instruments of the society are recorded below: 1) Pipa: The waist of the old-style pipa is too wide, resulting in a lack of high notes. Now, it is changed to a gourd shape, and four more frets can be added to the lower part to increase high notes. It is named the Gourd Pipa. 2) Yueqin: The neck of the old-style yueqin is too short. It has high notes but is not suitable. Now, it is changed to a vase shape, which can increase four high notes. It is named the Vase Qin. 3) Flute: The old method of flute membrane uses a round hole. When blowing a song, it often dries out halfway and the tone changes. Now, it is changed to a long oval hole, with more folds, so it will not dry out for a long time. 4) Low Fourth Guan: According to ordinary silk and bamboo instruments, there are only middle and high ranges. Therefore, when playing a song, it always feels not powerful enough. Now, a low-pitched wind instrument is specially made, its length is equal to the range of the six holes of the dongxiao, and the sound is four times lower than the ordinary sound. Therefore, it is named Double Fourth Guan. Other instruments such as Double Fourth Violin are under research and development and will be available soon.</p>

<p>Mid-River Pirates Rob Cargo Boat</p>
<h3>Rascals Take the Opportunity to Collude in Fraud</h3>
<p>Chen Zhixin, the owner of the Hengda Yarn Factory in Yangsi Bridge, Pudong, bought 530 bales of used clothing from the Shunfeng Used Clothing Company in Minhang on the 25th of last month, each bale weighing about 120 catties and valued at more than 2,000 yuan. He entrusted the boatman Xue Lansheng to transport them to Shanghai. However, when the boat arrived near Wujiadu, two pirate boats suddenly appeared, with nine bandits on board, each holding a box cannon. They jumped onto the cargo boat, first tying up the boatman Xue Zunsheng and his crew, and then moving all 530 bales of used clothing onto the pirate boats. They were towed by a small steamship directly to the Dingjiazai area of Tangkou, where they sold all the stolen clothing to Ding Caibo, Ding Xitang, Ding Aitang, Ding Bochu, and others who specialized in receiving stolen goods. After each bandit received the money, they divided the loot and fled. Later, after the Hengda factory owner Chen Zhixin learned of this, he reported it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team and other agencies, and a reward was offered for their arrest. Now, after investigation, the leader of the detective team, Lu Ying, arrested the key suspect Ding Aitang the day before yesterday. After questioning, he confessed clearly. He immediately led the detectives to Dingjiazai to search, but they had all fled. Only Ding's wife, Sun, was captured. Later, Ding and others entrusted the famous local rascals Tao Shunqing and Cai Afu to intercede with Chen and paid 2,800 yuan to settle the matter. However, Tao and Cai, colluding with the local village chief Ding Ruiqing, falsely accused the farmer Ding Jisheng and his four brothers of being involved in the theft and used threats to extort more than 5,500 yuan. Now that Ding Jisheng and others have learned of this, they have filed a criminal lawsuit with the local court yesterday, accusing Tao and Cai of falsely accusing innocent people of being thieves and extorting money.</p>

<p>Two Russians Rob Foreign Banknotes</p>
<h3>Detained and Sent to Police Station for Handling</h3>
<p>Recently, one or two Russians have been seen wandering around the Caojiadu area of ​​western Shanghai. When they see that there are only one or two young apprentices in the tobacco and paper shops, they go forward to exchange small coins. They deliberately exchange the small coins repeatedly. When the apprentice takes out a large number of small coins, they immediately grab them and flee. At about 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, at the Tang Yu Mao Tobacco and Paper Shop, No. 861 on Robert Sheng Road, western Shanghai, there happened to be only an apprentice, Chen Rongda, at the counter. Suddenly, a Russian came forward to exchange a foreign banknote for small coins. When he was exchanging the coins again and again, he robbed more than 100 corners (that is, more than 60 coins) and fled. Unexpectedly, at 3:40 PM yesterday afternoon, the Russian came again with an accomplice and broke directly into the counter, claiming to buy Pyramid cigarettes. As the apprentice was reaching for the cigarettes, the Russian stole a 10-yuan banknote from the counter drawer. The apprentice saw it and negotiated with him, but he insisted that it was his own ticket. The owner of the shop, Tang Fuquan, heard the noise and rushed down from the upstairs. The Russian then held the ticket and asked Tang to exchange it for cash. Tang saw that the ticket was indeed from his shop. When he questioned him, the Russian was completely unreasonable. Since Tang could not understand the language and he broke in, it was the apprentice's fault. So he reluctantly endured the loss and went upstairs to get loose money to exchange. Unexpectedly, the Russian followed him upstairs and snatched four 5-yuan banknotes that Tang had taken, putting them back into his sleeve. Tang then thought that he was like a bandit, so he called the police to detain the two Russians and send them to the Sixth District Police Station for investigation.</p>
<p>A Tragedy of Repeated Concubinage</p>
<p>▲ Old Lover Commits Murder</p>
<p>▲ Attempts Suicide After the Crime</p>
<p>Yang Weisui, a 48-year-old native of Nanjing, is engaged in the business of boiling water in a tiger stove in Shanghai. He married a fellow villager, Ms. Sha (34 years old this year), as his wife and rented a room in a pastry shop opposite the Wang family tiger stove in Shipipi Lane, in the city. She had an affair with Yang Sancai (the same age as her), a fellow villager who sells birds in the City God Temple at No. 203 Qinglian Road, Nine Acres. The day before yesterday (the 22nd), Yang Sancai learned that Ms. Sha's husband had returned to his hometown in Nanjing, so he rode to her house in the evening, wanting to continue their affair. When he arrived at Ms. Sha's place, he saw that she was whispering sweet nothings with her second landlord, Yang Agen. Therefore, Yang Sancai was furious with jealousy. That night at 8:00 PM, he went out with Ms. Sha to the Nanyang Inn at No. 337 Minti Yin Road in the French Concession and opened room number five on the third floor. Yang blamed Ms. Sha for continuing to have an affair with the second landlord. Ms. Sha refused to accept this, and the two began to quarrel. Unexpectedly, Yang Sancai was so angry that he had nowhere to vent. He suddenly became murderous and used the razor he was carrying to stab Ms. Sha's throat, face, and right hand three times. Blood flowed like a river. Ms. Sha was injured and fell to the ground, shouting for help. The inn attendant heard the sound and went upstairs to investigate. Yang panicked and jumped out of the window to escape, but he injured his legs and feet and fell to the ground. Knowing that he had caused trouble and fearing punishment, he took the same sharp knife and tried to commit suicide by cutting his throat. People nearby noticed this and rushed to take the knife away. The injuries were still minor. The inn then reported the incident to the Xiafei Road patrol station, which sent detectives to send Ms. Sha and Yang to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that Ms. Sha's injuries are very serious, and her life may be in danger.</p>

<h3>Sentence Reduced to Twelve Years Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Ding Mingcai, a barber from Zhenjiang, is 53 years old. He used to run a shop in Vladivostok. This time, he came to Shanghai from Vladivostok. On the evening of the 4th of last month, he lured Ma Yuangui, a fellow villager and colleague, to an alley in Yixin Lane on Lao Yong'an Street in the French Concession, pulled out a sharp knife, and stabbed Ma in a vital spot, killing him. He then abandoned the knife and fled. Later, Zhou Shangguang, a Chinese detective from the French patrol station, arrested Ding and sent him to the Second Special District Court. The patrol station lawyer filed a public prosecution according to law. Ding confessed that Ma was too bad, writing a letter to his son-in-law saying that his father and daughter had committed adultery. After receiving the letter, the son-in-law returned his daughter. He had ruined his reputation too much, so he hated him and killed him. The court appointed a lawyer to defend him, declared the defense closed, and waited for the scheduled sentencing. It has been reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday morning, when the time for sentencing arrived, the patrol station escorted Ding to the court. Wang Gangxu, the chief of the criminal court, presided over the first criminal court and sentenced Ding Mingcai to 12 years of imprisonment for premeditated murder, and deprived him of his civil rights for 12 years. The number of days of detention before the trial was set off against the imprisonment at two days per day. The defendant was transferred back to the detention center.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Orders Restriction on Private Middle Schools Running Normal Schools</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to the directors of county education bureaus stating that normal schools are places for cultivating elementary school teachers and should be planned by the provincial and county education administrative organs based on the needs of teachers.

This department has repeatedly prohibited this and requested the Ministry of Education to impose restrictions. All private middle schools that have already been approved to run normal schools may continue to do so, but others are not allowed to run them. The order from the Ministry of Education stated: "Having reviewed the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's proposed measures to restrict private middle schools from running normal schools, which are deemed very important, we provisionally approve the record pending the promulgation of the Normal School Organization Law by this ministry." Therefore, in addition to distributing this order, it is hereby ordered that the bureau directors be informed and that they pass this order on to the private middle schools under their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Cai, Zhao Zuwei, Zeng Jinke, Zhu Zhiming, Chen Dingqing, Liu Yaoguang. Alumni including Shen Dingming and Zhu Daosheng, as well as all faculty, staff, and students of the school, totaling over 1,200 people, gathered together, making it a grand occasion. Chairman of the Board Cai Yuanpei presided over the ceremony. After the formalities, Cai gave a speech, stating that the Art College has been established for 20 years. When a young person reaches the age of 20, they should be independent. In their youth, they are naturally not noticed by society. After many trials and tribulations, relying on the hard work of the mother, Mr. Liu Haisu, they have reached adulthood and begun to work in society and become known to society. Twenty years ago, there were no art schools in China. It was not until 1918 that the National Peiping Art College was established, and not until 1928 that the National West Lake Art School was established. Therefore, our school was the first to be established and has the power to turn the tide of the times in the history of art in our country. Today, everyone recognizes the Art College as the only art school in our country, but even if it becomes the only art school in the world, it should strive to achieve excellence. Therefore, it is hoped that the government and society will do their best to supervise and assist it.蔡</p>
<p>After Cai finished his speech, the school principal, Liu Haisu, reported on the 20-year history of the Art College, stating that the school has been established for 20 years, but China did have fine art. But the new art education began with the school in 1912. At that time, the trend of young people was focused on law and politics, which was also due to the need for changes in national politics at that time. Therefore, the initial students of the Art College's predecessor, the Painting and Art Academy, were very few in number. We feel that the survival of the nation and the rise of the country require the entire activity of art, philosophy, science, and politics. Art is a symbol of the spirit of the times and national characteristics. He then recounted the 20 years of the Art College, which have been a constant struggle in pain. Then, Vice Principal Wang Jiyuan reported on the current situation of the school. Mayor Wu Tiecheng's representative, Xu Peihuang, gave a speech, stating that art and science should advance simultaneously and be carefully promoted so that people can have a fulfilling life, without being biased towards science, and no longer following in the footsteps of Europeans' overly scientific lives. Later, Municipal Party Department representative Mao Xiaxuan, Education Bureau representative Zheng Tan, and guests Chen Qicai, Zhao Zuwei, and Zeng Jinke gave speeches one after another, unanimously praising the Art College's efforts over the past 20 years, which moved all those who listened. Finally, Board Member representative Ye Gongchuo gave a thank-you speech and reported on the plan for future development. Faculty representative Jiang Danshu gave a speech, and student representatives from various schools gave congratulatory speeches. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM with music. It is reported that the school will hold an exhibition of recent works by faculty and students at the school on Caishi Road for three days, displaying recent works by faculty and students in over 20 rooms. In addition, an exhibition of calligraphy and paintings by ancient and modern artists will be held at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Avenue Road and the Mingfu Library on Albert Road for ten days, and calligraphy and painting coupons will be issued. By drawing lots with the coupons, one can get a piece of calligraphy and painting masterpiece. Also, starting tonight, the 23rd, a fun fair will be held at the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall in Guizhou for three nights. The first night will be a concert, the second night will be Peking opera, and the third night will be a drama. All departments have been preparing for several months, making it a large-scale celebration.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Women's High School and Nanyang Business College Invite Ms. Lin Pengxia to Give a Speech</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Considers New School Building Plan</h3>
<p>The Yuyuan Road West New School, which the Shanghai Municipal Council plans to build, was previously deemed too expensive. The Public Works Department investigated the situation of other schools and redesigned it. Recently, several acting directors have submitted reports to the Education Committee, arguing that the construction standards of municipal schools should not be lowered. However, in order to save expenses, a revised plan has been proposed to build a school that can accommodate 550 students, requiring 160,000 taels of silver (originally estimated at 250,000 taels). The original plan to build a meeting hall will be abandoned, and the manual arts room will still be located in the existing shed. For meeting needs, there will be four classrooms that can be temporarily connected, which can accommodate 150 students gathering. Land will be reserved for future construction of a meeting hall (estimated cost of 40,000 taels). One committee member stated that they had recently visited the Eastern District Primary School and found that the school's meeting hall was too large and too exquisite. If the Zoujin Nie Zhongcheng Public School needs a meeting hall, they can temporarily borrow it from the public school. The new public school is also close to the Yuyuan Road Girls' School, so it may be possible to borrow it in the future. In addition, it is also possible to eliminate walking corridors in the future construction, and then the acting supervisor of education stated that borrowing the girls' school meeting hall seems difficult to do. In order to save money, the meeting hall can be postponed, but if the school enrolls more than 500 students in the future, it will definitely not be able to accommodate them in a room for 150 people. Therefore, it should still be rebuilt when the economy is slightly better. Another committee member asked if it was possible to cancel the cloakroom and use the corridor for this purpose. The acting director of the Public Works Department replied that the corridor is short and not enough. After discussion, it was decided to ask the Public Works Department to make a model according to the 160,000 plan. The Public Works Department also proposed that there are many school buildings to be built in the future, and it is proposed to form a small committee to review the plans. The committee agreed and elected Dr. Tang and Dr. Ou Yuanhuai to serve as members, along with the acting supervisor of education and the Shanghai Municipal Council's building engineer. The above committee's decision has been approved by the board of directors meeting on the 10th.</p>

<p>Southeast Team Overwhelms Yellow Team in Western Youth Women's Basketball Game Last Night</p>
<h3>| Eighteen to Six |</h3>
<p>| Chongde Struggles Against Liangjiang A |</p>
<p>| Loses 19 to 55 |</p>
<p>In the Western Youth Women's Basketball League, the two games of the second week last night, Liangjiang A's 55-19 win over Chongde and Southeast's 28-6 win over the Yellow Team, were the most exciting and watchable. In the final game, the Western Youth Red Team defeated the American Women's Team 29-17, which was also very interesting.</p>
<h3>Bitter Battle at Chongde Between Two Jiang Teams</h3>
<p>Chongde Surprises Both Jiang Teams: Unexpected.</p>
<p>First Half: Chongde excels in both offense and defense, displaying a burst of energy. Although Yang Sen of Two Jiang successfully scored two goals consecutively, Chongde made one free throw, quickly tying the score at 4-4. With Wang Xiangying's skillful shot, they took the lead at 6-4. The three forwards demonstrated extremely lively skills, with Wang Xiangying being the best. In the first half, they defeated the strong Two Jiang team with a score of 10-8.</p>
<p>Lack of Strength Leads to Defeat: Although Chongde had the advantage in the first half, they were ultimately younger and weaker, with far less stamina than Two Jiang. They couldn't run as fast as Two Jiang, and the defenders were exhausted from running back and forth, showing signs of fatigue. With their defense weakened, the second half became unsalvageable, with Two Jiang scoring as many as twenty points. Chongde only managed three points. In the second half, Chongde didn't focus on individual defense, only being three points behind in the third half. In the end, Two Jiang won decisively with a score of 55-19.</p>
<p>▲ Two Jiang A: Fouls, Points ▲ Chongde: Fouls, Points</p>
<p>Yang Sen (Forward): 1 foul, 26 points Wang Xiangying (Forward): 0 fouls, 7 points</p>

<p>Third Half: Two Jiang A: 8 points, 5 points</p>
<p>Fourth Half: Two Jiang A: 19 points, 1 point</p>
<h3>Southeast Elite Troops Defeat the Yellow Team</h3>
<p>Southeast Breaks Through the Second Gate: Although the Yellow Team is a strong rowing team, against Southeast, they were no match. Surrounded on all sides, unable to attack and unable to defend, Southeast scored six points in the first half before the Yellow Team finally made two free throws. After that, they didn't score another point. Southeast won the first half with a score of 19-2. They only scored four points in the second half. Ms. Sun Zhang of Southeast missed many makeable shots, otherwise, the score would have been more than 28-6. Southeast has already defeated the Red Team and now broken through the second gate. Observing their strength, they have great prospects and are a strong rival to Two Jiang. However, there is still the Green Team, which must be carefully guarded against.</p>
<p>Pan Yueying Dominates the Entire Field: Pan Yueying was the best player on the field, scoring twenty out of twenty-eight points. Her shooting accuracy was exceptional, whether shooting from below or throwing, she was calm and composed, hitting every shot. Her rebounding was also consistently successful. Sun Yuxiu and Zhang Zhejun were slightly less impressive. The defense was very good, with Wang Zhixin being the most outstanding.</p>
<p>▲ Southeast: Fouls, Points ▲ Yellow Team: Fouls, Points</p>
<p>Pan Yueying (Forward): 2 fouls, 20 points Ge Lan (Forward): 1 foul, 1 point</p>

<p>Third Half: Southeast: 3 points Yellow Team: 2 points</p>
<p>Fourth Half: Southeast: 6 points Yellow Team: 2 points</p>
<h3>Two Jiang B Loses to Primary School Team</h3>
<p>The game between Two Jiang B and the Primary School Team was less interesting due to the skill gap between the two teams. Luo Qiyun of Two Jiang was the best player. The Primary School Team was better than Two Jiang B. In the first half, Two Jiang won by one point with a score of 7-6, but after that, the Primary School Team took the lead and was never caught, losing with a score of 11-25.</p>
<p>▲ Two Jiang B: Fouls, Points ▲ Primary School: Fouls, Points</p>
<p>Zhu Heifeng (Forward): 2 fouls, 2 points Ke Lasha (Forward): 2 fouls, 10 points</p>

<p>Jiangnan University Football Game Scheduled to Be Held in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Chizhi College Forfeits Due to Inability to Form a Team</h3>
<p>The football championship competition of the Jiangnan University Sports Association is scheduled to begin next week. In the schedule, Nanjing Central University was originally scheduled to play Guanghua on November 19th and Jinan on December 10th, both of which should be held in Shanghai. It is now learned that Central University cannot come to Shanghai on time due to schoolwork reasons and has agreed with the above two schools to change the dates to December 26th against Guanghua and December 28th against Jinan, held at the original locations. In addition, Chizhi College has voluntarily forfeited all games due to its inability to form a team.</p>
<h3>Youth Association Prepares Heated Swimming</h3>
<p>Ling Xitao, director of the Sports Department of the Sichuan Youth Association, and Yu Binqi, chairman of the Chinese Swimming Research Association, are aware of the scarcity of swimming pools established by Chinese people in Shanghai, and the lack of sources for producing swimming talent. Although several swimming pools are open every year during the hot summer months for comrades to practice and compete, they are closed as soon as late autumn arrives and the weather turns cold. Many people who are interested in practicing stop because the water is cold. When summer comes again next year, they go back into the water, and the results of what they learned last year are forgotten. Therefore, the time for learning is only three months out of the year, while the time spent neglecting it occupies three-quarters, preventing those who are interested from making progress. Now, Ling and Yu plan to gather swimming comrades in Shanghai and raise preparatory funds to install a water heater in the swimming pool of the Chinese Youth Association on Sichuan Road, so that there will be a continuous training opportunity throughout the year to cultivate swimming talent. It is heard that they are actively proceeding and will soon solicit members.</p>

<h3>New Basketball Techniques (3) (5) (Not Allowed) (Reprinted)</h3>
<p>—Original by Claire Burcky, Translated by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>The Northwestern University basketball team in the United States was the champion of the Ten Giants Tournament in 1913 and also a dominant force. This different key tactic is used to defeat individual defense. It is said that coach Dutch Donborg trains his team to use this method, from a fixed formation.</p>
<p>Number one will pass the ball to number four, number three and number five will cross the left and right sides of the court. Number three will first pass in front of number four, blocking number five's defender. Number five will then closely curve past number four, receive number four's pass, and directly advance to the basket to shoot.</p>
<p>Otherwise, number one can pass the ball to number three, and then follow up, blocking number three's defender, giving number three the opportunity to dribble to the free throw area arc. Number three will then pass the ball to number five, who is penetrating the end of the court. At this time, number five's defender is again blocked.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Quotations from Ma Xiangbo, a Ninety-Three-Year-Old</p>
<h3>Hoping for the Illumination of the "Eternal Supreme Wisdom"</h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>The Elder Xiang made the following observation when commenting on Chinese and foreign philosophers:</p>
<p>"I feel that among the early Confucians, there was no philosopher like Aristotle! Not even Plato's ideal!</p>
<p>Confucius's life was very noble, but 'the Master's discourse on nature and the Way of Heaven was not to be heard,' as recorded by his disciples. The Master himself said, 'If I hear the Way in the morning, I can die content in the evening!' What Way is this, that one would be willing to die content after hearing it in the morning? It can be seen that this Way is truly precious.</p>
<p>Lao Tzu's Way that can be spoken is not the constant Way; fortunately, there is a 'constant' character; heaven and earth are long-lasting, constantly naturally silent | perhaps he originally came to China from Asia Minor; therefore, in his later years, he went west again through the Hangu Pass to return; otherwise, why go west? Liezi claimed that there were sages in the West, who is this referring to, the Savior?</p>
<p>The ancient Jews looked forward to the Savior, as if hoping for the year, as detailed in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Plato knew what is called Being; because there are many small existences, he knew that there is an absolute existence; from this unique existence, there is 'all' existence. According to the Chinese 'all' two characters, did they exist in ancient times? Or did they come from the Catholic classics of the late Ming Dynasty? I cannot decide; I remain doubtful!</p>
<p>The great philosopher is, after all, Aristotle, who lived more than 2,300 years ago, not only excelled in logic but also spoke of investigating things; he laid the various foundations of science, and his theories still influence us today. His philosophy relied on the organization and expansion of St. Thomas. According to historical records, in his old age and love of learning, at the time of his death, he earnestly prayed to the Creator, saying: Hoping for the illumination of the "eternal supreme wisdom"!</p>
<p>Aristotle's great spirit, in this one sentence, will endure forever!"</p>
<p>Cold and Heat</p>
<h3>| The Contradictory Nature of the Times |</h3>
<p>— Fu Hongliao</p>
<p>After a gust of autumn wind blew tighter, the winter clothes that had been separated for a long time were blown onto the body one by one. The rich abandoned the old and chose new ones, while the poor only circled in front of the longevity store. Coldness welled up from the heart; warmth, new clothes, wearing them on the body is relatively warmer than old ones, the same autumn, the same in Shanghai, cold and heat, fully dividing into two phenomena, | poverty and wealth!</p>
<p>The same wind, in autumn and winter, attacking the body would make people feel panicked. On the road, I walked slowly, and facing my jacket that still had a breath, I couldn't help but respond with a sympathetic sigh. Walking, I walked forward with my head down, and a young woman came towards me, her snow-white fox fur coat wrapping her entire snake-like body, only revealing a moving little face, snow-white, a quick longing flashed in my mind;</p>
<p>"......According to reports......the north is bitterly cold, and it snows in late autumn, the anti-Japanese warriors, trembling with guns, only need sufficient clothing......"</p>
<h3>The Incomplete World</h3>
<p>— Fang Tian</p>
<p>The world is ultimately incomplete. The first is the limitation of life. | Although scientists have invented longevity wine (as reported), it is only for the rich to enjoy, and it can only extend life by ten years. After ten years, one cannot avoid returning to the yellow earth. This is the first major defect of life. The second defect is that youth cannot be permanent, so that general modern ladies, middle-aged women, although people are not old, their appearance has declined, and they have to borrow lead rouge. This artificial difficulty is difficult to defeat natural, chicken skin above, making red and white patches, like the characters in Journey to the West, is very frightening. If you look in the mirror, you can't help but sigh three times at the mirror. This is the second major defect of life. Next, the prosperity of Shanghai is the best in the country. Logically, this Paris of the East should be a paradise on earth. However, there are beggars wandering on the streets, robbers robbing on the road, brothels and meat shops stand in great numbers, and smoke dens and gambling places are everywhere, showing the morbid state of society everywhere. Civilization and depravity are standing opposite each other, a great view in history. Make the wives and ladies of general wealthy families, often be wary, not dare to wear all the treasures at home, as much as possible, walking down the street, this can also be regarded as a pity. In addition, the Far East was originally very calm, but Japan insisted on provoking war; a modern lady walking on the road, encounters a beggar who does not know the situation, especially nails behind her, all such things, it is difficult to finish citing examples, so I will stop here. In short, this is an incomplete world.</p>
<p>I thought, such a wind, probably the snow outside the customs is even greater, those soldiers holding guns, the top is floating like powder snow, the whole body is buried in the snow white inside the child: so I also looked at the woman wearing a snow-white fox fur coat, cast a final line of sight, two snow-white shadows, found out at the same time, cold and heat, two clear contrasts, my body shuddered!</p>
<p>Thoughts are so likely to attack people's weaknesses, after one impression fades, quickly another runs to this head. Remember, this was several months ago, when the weather was still very sweaty, and everyone was enthusiastically donating money to the anti-Japanese volunteer army in the northeast, turning over the newspaper every day. At that time, I thought like this, assuming that everyone was donating so enthusiastically, the temperature was as hot as the weather, but it would not disappear, this amazing donation, how much more spectacular! However, the autumn wind has risen, and a gust of wind has blown everyone's hands into their pockets, so the donations seen in the newspaper are as rare as the dawn stars when the sky is about to dawn. When it's hot, everyone is so happy, when it's cold, everyone is also as bleak as the cold weather. Cold, needs clothing, heat... People are following the weather · Especially the Chinese. Cold and heat, fully expressing a kind of era disease of the Chinese people, in the middle of cold and heat, you can see the psychology of the general people |</p>
<p>Teahouse in Name Only</p>
<h3>| Unique Atmosphere of Taixian County |</h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>In any place, the place with the teahouse signboard is always the stronghold of general tea masters; only our Taixian teahouse is in name only. Smaller teahouses, at least selling snacks is the main body of their business, medium-sized brands, in addition to selling snacks, also sell a kind of chicken juice soup noodles: their organization, can make outsiders, dare not be the host, the names are numerous, the tricks are varied, teach you no way to deal with, tea leaves to bring their own, brewing water is the waiter's extra money; for example, if you want to drink wine, there are wine vendors, drinking and tea, there is a bowl of dried silk, this dried silk is cooked, with sesame oil, soy sauce, shrimp, shrimp rice mixed, its taste is very beautiful | dried silk with eat with increase, see customers usually reward the small account how much, to determine the number of times to add dried silk; this scene, is the opening play of eating tea, the original is to eat snacks, eat chicken juice noodles, this snack, is the steamed bun made of flour, because it is steamed on the cage, also called "small cage", with crab yellow diced meat to make the filling, the noodle soup is chicken juice fish stewed, there are over the bridge, clear soup and other names: for example, two bowls of noodles, it is called two eight points, each eight points, there is a pot of crucian carp outside, called pouring head, its quality is crisp and fragrant | Jiangnan rarely has this kind of production method: a tea meal finished eating, calculate the money, the principal, the small account, wring the towel, pack the water smoke, separate categories, one by one expenditure, the tea meal account book, take the seat as a unit, also called compartment, if this second seat in this room, it is called compartment two: the people who patronize, commenting, talking about business, the owner please partners, apprentices worshiping masters, all eat a tea, compared to eating some light of the reward, please eat a tea, clearly go to eat steamed buns and noodles, but said: is "go to the teahouse" do not eat steamed buns and noodles, usually there is a satirical saying: teach to do "eating tea do not eat snacks, but there is a big appearance yeah;" just as the Shanghai people say: spiritedly, like something is wrong, if the reader to Taixian to go, if someone gives you such a slip, "by invitation tomorrow morning nine o'clock a tea party in a certain teahouse, wu xi gladden but is fortunate." You must not only take it as tasting tea, you must first clear the accumulated goods, ready to eat a full meal.</p>
<p>Such as the city north's Bin Garden, Sheng Chang, Wan Hua Lou, Ju Le Yuan, also sell Chinese lunch and dinner, generation package feast, furnishings seats, are beautiful and grand, not like a monotonous teahouse; the real teahouse, only one shop called "Guang Sheng Ju", is the market of Lu Chen industry union; in the oppressive summer heat, Zhongshan Park also sells clear tea, is a place for modern men and women to enjoy the cool during the summer vacation, they are drunk with no intention of tea.</p>
<h3>The Crossroads of Death (2)(10)(3)</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>Alas! She is our child bride, naturally there is nothing to miss, I am the only seed here, how can I harden my heart, leave my parents who gave birth to me and raised me, and not even leak a message to them? But saving a dinner, thinking that in the happy family economy (illegible), only the heavenly pumpkin can fill the (illegible) village economy collapsed, living here, waiting for old, death, what does it mean? These thoughts, then there is no second distraction enough to disturb his will, and then yearn to the heart.</p>
<p>After making up his mind, he felt that everything in front of him was bright. What is there to miss about such a big pumpkin! Let the parents do it! Rather than giving them the pain of life oppression, how about giving them the wandering son's despondency?</p>
<p>Before the sun was completely swallowed by the horizon, they ate dinner, because they could save a lamp, usually A Gen ate at least three bowls, this evening "effort to add meals", only eat one bowl and a half. Liu Da did not pay attention, Liu Pozi was very careful, and asked:</p>
<p>'A Gen! Are you feeling well today? One and a half bowls is enough'?</p>
<p>"Comfortable", thought for a while, and then said: "Just went to the front village, ate a glutinous rice dumpling at Jiang Niupi's house".</p>
<p>Liu Da heard the three words Jiang Niupi, the boss was not happy, deeply strange son to associate with this kind of person, could not help but say:</p>
<p>'Jiang Niupi is unconscionable, his parents are long gone, thanks to his aunt, raising him to adulthood, in the previous years, secretly ran away, ran to nowhere, not even sending a letter, I always thought that such unconscionable people, must do cannon fodder, who knows that he is still alive, also thinking of home, how many money to bring back? Afraid that I can't live, come to force my aunt to (illegible)' He did not scold A Gen, why to associate with Jiang Niupi! But this seat of words, has implied to A Gen, should be far away and avoid it. A Gen originally wanted to tell Jiang Niupi about his experience, say some out, prove that these years in the outside struggle, already had a grasp, although a platoon leader, has surpassed the situation of Liu Da's son A Gen. But Jiang Niupi is still a Jiang Niupi, did not show the situation of the platoon leader, how can make people believe it. Therefore also swallowed, did not say.</p>
<p>Liu Pozi did not know where to hear the news, said:</p>
<p>'Old man! You don't know yet! Jiang Ersaozi is going to be an old princess."</p>
<p>Liu Da laughed, almost spitting out a mouthful of rice, hurriedly put down the rice bowl, wipe the short beard, put on a funny face said:</p>
<p>'Could it be a dream? Who became an official? Even if Jiang Niupi became an official, there is no such good conscience; with such a good conscience, it is not Jiang Niupi.</p>
<p>This kind of logical law containing philosophy, directly made people speechless, but Liu Pozi still has the courage, citing the scriptures to argue with him:</p>
<p>'Generals and ministers have no seeds, men should be self-reliant. There are also farmers who become emperors, isn't Zhu Taizu "watching cattle"?'</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>A GlimPSE OF FINANCIAL Activity Amidst the busyness</h3>
<p>In recent days, the market has felt vigorous due to brisk customer sales of Changmao [a type of commodity]. Small firms engaged in spot transactions are all extremely busy and overwhelmed with trivial matters. The stock on hand in this district is substantial, so there is a large volume of sales, but the commission rate hasn’t moved. It's likely that this favorable situation can be expected to be a long-term consolidation, and there won't be any more drastic drops. The tight money situation seems to be the standard state of affairs, so it remains unchanged recently. Minor coin fluctuations are also slight, but copper coins fluctuate a bit more.</p>
<p>(Commission Firm, Premium Rate Slightly High) The "Foreign Commission" rate in the early market was slightly lower than the previous afternoon by .375, at 7 qian, 1 fen, 2 li, 8 hao, 7 hu, 5 si. In the afternoon market, due to excessive bullish sentiment, it continued to rise, reaching the previous afternoon's original price of 7 qian, 1 fen, 3 li, 2 hao, 5 si. The "Silver Discount" was the same in both the morning and afternoon markets, at 4 fen, an improvement of 2 fen from the previous day. The surcharge remained consistently a "blank surcharge" because the backing for silver was exceptionally abundant, and banks were also issuing funds, so there was no reason for any adulteration.</p>
<p>(Small Coins Down, Copper Coins Up) Jiangnan small silver coins were down a small half li in the early market, at 6 qian, 1 fen, 7 li. The afternoon market was down another small li, at 6 qian, 1 fen, 6 li. As a result, the two markets were down a total of 1.5 li. Transaction volume was 9,000 jiao in the early market and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins were also down a small half li in the early market, at 6 qian, 1 fen, 6 li. The afternoon market was unchanged. However, the Jiangnan jiao and Guangdong jiao prices were equivalent on that day, which was an unusual market price. Transaction volume was 125,000 jiao in the early market and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins suddenly rose by 3,000 cash, to 399 cash. Transaction volume was over 37,500 strings, with a total value of 9,400 taels.</p>
<p>(Busy Inflow and Outflow of Silver and Foreign Currencies) News of the bank's receipt and disbursement of "Silver Funds" yesterday was slightly busier than the previous day. Chinese merchants deposited 2.45 million to 2.5 million taels, foreign merchants deposited 2.55 million to 2.6 million taels, various commodity exchange tax revenues amounted to 1.01 million taels, special deposits amounted to 2.7 million to 2.8 million taels, collateral transactions amounted to over 1.3 million taels, telegraphic transfers amounted to 500,000 taels, warehouse withdrawals amounted to 1.2 million taels, and receipts from money shops and silver brokers amounted to over 3.11 million taels. Surcharge receipts amounted to over 410,000 taels, receipts from various remittances amounted to over 700,000 taels, and cash receipts amounted to over 100,000 taels. The "Foreign Currency" exchange and transfer of funds in the early market reached 1.355 million taels, and 870,000 taels in the afternoon market. Banknote transactions were 60,000 taels in the early market and 65,000 taels in the afternoon market. Off-exchange banknote transactions were 120,000 taels in the early market and 90,000 taels in the afternoon market. Voucher transactions were 55,000 taels in the early market and 40,000 taels in the afternoon market. Banks bought actual funds, interbank trading was 1.25 million taels in the early market and 850,000 taels in the afternoon market. Money shops and foreign exchange brokers collected over 3.11 million taels, surcharge receipts amounted to over 220,000 taels, interbank lending of foreign currency amounted to over 2.4 million taels, foreign currency collateral transactions amounted to over 900,000 taels, and transactions of small money shops with customers amounted to over 1.2 million taels.</p>
<h3>A WEAK GOLD MARKET</h3>
<p>(Minor Changes Caused by Confusing International News) Yesterday's market had few changes and a relatively flat downward trend. However, conflicting international news caused hesitation. From morning to afternoon, there was a difference of two to three taels. Ultimately, compared to the previous day, it fell by 2.3 taels. Various firms competed for supply, and the price fluctuated around 760 taels. The gold market weakened at the opening, showing an unusual trend. The British pound rose while the U.S. dollar fell. Although forward prices fell, the base remained strong, which had an impact. Later, news came from abroad that Italy was considering repaying its U.S. debt, and buyers continued to purchase, returning to the 60-tael level. However, although the foreign exchange rate showed a slight contraction, the internal situation was not tight, mainly because sellers were active on the surface. There was also news that war debts might be delayed, so the market price softened again, ultimately falling back below 60 taels. There were very few swap transactions, and the premium was generally above 6 taels. Due to the market being closed on Wednesday, the conditions of the previous market are recorded below.</p>
<p>(Underlying Downward Trend, Falling by 2.3 Taels) The January opening price was 759 taels and 9 qian, a drop of 1.9 taels. (Before the opening, the gray market for goods was still stable, around 60 taels). Subsequently, due to stimulating news, it immediately broke through 60 taels. Furthermore, due to the scramble to purchase by firms such as Dadecheng, Hengchang, Yongyifeng, and Yongzhaofengchang, it continued to rise by 2 taels, reaching 62 taels. However, the exchange rate for British pounds and U.S. dollars seemed to loosen. Maihang [a firm] offered March at 1.975, while the brokers Chuan Gen offered February U.S. dollars at $29.6875. In addition, Yuanmao, Yongheng, Yuzhifeng, Yongyuhe, Yuanxing, Yongfutaiheng, and others sold over one tael of Leeson, at 60 taels and 4 qian. It was then learned that HSBC had reduced both British and U.S. exchange rates by .125 each. Furthermore, Great Britain made a forward purchase of March exchange at 3.28125. At 9:30, it was 61 taels and a half. Subsequently, it was peaceful, but Huabi offered December U.S. dollars at .4375 and March at .6875, and the price turned soft again. Yuanmao, Yongzhaofengchang, Qianchangxiang, Yuantai, Yuanchun, Zhifeng, Yongchengfengyong and others heavily sold, resulting in a decrease of 2 taels, to 59 taels and a half at 10:00. Shortly after, firms such as Dadecheng, Yuantai, Yuanheng, Yifengyong bought, so it rose by one tael, to 60 taels and 7 qian at around 10:10. Moments later, Hengyu, Chengfengyong, Wanxing, and general retail investors sold, and it was also rumored that U.S. President Hoover and Roosevelt were discussing a plan to postpone war debts, which might be resolved, and sentiment seemed soft. The price fell slightly by over one tael, reaching 59 taels at nearly 11:00. In an instant, Bingxing, Yifengyong, Hengyu, and Fuxingyong bought, and Andar absorbed February U.S. dollars at .6875. At 11:15, it was 60 taels and 8 qian. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of several qian to one tael, but there were more suppliers. It is estimated that Hongli, Hengyongyuhe, and Yifengyong Tongtaichang and others disposed of goods, but the exchange market was peaceful. At noon, it closed at 59 taels and 2 qian, then closed at 59 taels and 5 qian, a decrease of 2.3 taels compared to the previous day. According to the half-day, the maximum was 62 taels and the minimum was 59 taels, a difference of 3 taels. The naked premium was estimated to be 15.5 taels to 16 taels. Yingfengheng and others concluded one or two flat trades.</p>
<p>(Quoted Price Mostly Suppressed by Six Taels) The quoted price for the U.S. dollar was reduced by .125, resulting in 824 taels, a suppression of 63 or 4 taels, which was 6 taels more than the previous day. Registration prices: November 67 taels, December 66 taels, January 60 taels, replenishment water 66 taels.</p>
<p>(Inflow and Outflow of Various Firms Not Heated) Trading on the surface was normal. According to statistics, Fuxingyong, Yifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Yongfeng, Hengchangyong, Yuanheng, Yuanmaoyong and others all bought, while Yuankangxiang, Hengyu, Zhifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Futaiheng, Hongli, Yuhe, and Taifengcheng all sold. Dadecheng, Wanxing, Yuantai, Shunli, and Yuanxingyong had mixed transactions. The Dalian gang sold a total of over 200 contracts, buying over 100. The Guangdong gang had very few transactions. The total amount of contracts for various firms, up to the previous day, was approximately over 18,000.</p>
<h3>Nominal Contraction, Actual Release of Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the gold market, the British pound rose and the U.S. dollar fell, while the exchange rate of British pounds against U.S. dollars continued to decline. The decline of the U.S. dollar against the British pound eased slightly and rebounded. However, the trend of foreign exchange in this port was slightly different: nominally contracted, but actually released. Both British and U.S. exchange rates were reduced by .125, and the rest were also consistently reduced. However, Hong Kong remained unchanged. This was the bank's transaction price. The British pound was initially flat and then stable, ultimately rising by .0625 compared to the previous day. Transactions were no more than several tens of thousands of pounds. The gold firms settled slightly. The U.S. dollar initially stabilized and then declined, fluctuating in a circle, but without much change. Ultimately, it was similar to the previous day, with approximately 400,000 to 500,000 taels traded. The inflow and outflow of gold merchants were not significant, without any major movements. It is estimated that Da Zheng made forward purchases of British and U.S. exchange rates, purchasing March U.S. dollars at $29.75 and selling shillings at 1.975 (Fuchang sold off), equivalent to U.S. silver at $3.2825. The old Citibank also did the same at the same price (sold off by the silver company), equivalent to U.S. silver at $3.285. In the afternoon, due to Wednesday being a non-market day, the (British exchange) internal market was very flat. From the early opening, the selling price for November was one shilling, nine pence, and six two five, for January .6875, and for February and March .75. The buying price was increased by .0625. Maihang offered March at .75, Great Britain offered March at .75, and Citibank offered .75. The afternoon closing was the same as the early market.</p>
<p>(U.S. Dollar) The internal market only fluctuated by .125. From the morning selling price of $29.4375 for November, half a yuan for December, .615 for January, .6875 for February, and .75 for March, the buying price was $29.5625 to .875. Maihang and Huabi traded December at half a yuan, Pangen offered February at .625 to .6875. Maihang and Great Britain bought March at .75. Huabi offered December at .4375 and also traded March at .6875 with Hefeng. Zhongfu offered February at .625 to .6875. Pangen sold December at half a yuan to Citibank. Citibank bought March at .75. Maihang and Huabi traded December at half a yuan. Andar bought February at .6875. Maihang and Huabi traded December at half a yuan. The afternoon closing for November and December was the same, at half a yuan, .625 for January, .6875 for February, and .75 for March. The buying price was .5625 to .875. The listed exchange rate was one yuan, equivalent to three taels, four qian, three fen, three four eight, it is said.</p>
<h3>Large Silver Bars Near Par, Forward Contracts Contracted</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 23rd: The price of large silver bars remains unchanged in the near term, closing at 18 pence and .125. The forward price is 18 pence and .1875, a contraction of .0625. The British-American exchange rate opened at $3.275.</p>
<h3>Seven-Year Long-Term Bonds Rise by Six and a Half Yuan</h3>
<p>|20 Series Consolidated Salt Tax Bonds Rise by Six or Seven Jiao|</p>
<p>|Other Changes Minor, Market Conditions Brisk|</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 23rd) at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, futures trading was only not conducted for 96 Financial forward contracts. All other current and next-month contracts were open for trading. Trading was active, and sentiment was lively. However, there were few spot transactions. Market sentiment was unsettled, and demand and supply varied, so prices fluctuated. There was a change of over one yuan between the early and late markets. The early morning buying was stronger, and prices continued to rise by about five or six jiao uniformly compared to the previous day. Afterwards, selling prevailed in the market due to high prices, hovering and falling, so the two afternoon sessions were the lowest periods. However, the closing rebounded due to large investors buying in, and selling pressure eased slightly, resulting in renewed strength. As a result, it was similar to the early morning, with 20 Series Consolidated Salt Tax, Customs Tax, and other bonds continuing to rise by about six or seven jiao compared to the previous day. Others fluctuated up and down, with amounts only around two or three jiao. Financial bonds rose by eight jiao, and seven-year long-term spot bonds, which had not been traded for a long time, rose by as much as six and a half yuan compared to late last month. Furthermore, the futures trading volume yesterday was over 6.6 million in the morning session and over 4.4 million yuan in the afternoon session, for a total of 10,895,000 yuan. Among them, Salt Tax and 20 Series bonds were the most traded, reaching over 1.9 million each. Spot transactions only totaled 26,500 yuan.</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn Market After Bulls Cut Losses</p>
<h3>|Overseas Cotton Still Weak, Spot Sales Hopeless|</h3>
<p>The yarn market has softened, and the situation is weakening again. Overseas cotton markets are still weak, and there is no hope for the development of actual demand. As a result, sentiment is depressed. Some buyers, seeing the poor environment, are cutting their long positions, and the market is declining. In short, spot yarn sales are too sluggish, and short sellers all have spot goods in hand. All factories are very willing to open, it is said.</p>
<p>(People's Standard Down Six or Seven Qian) At the opening of the People's Standard market, the situation was weak again. Due to a lack of buyers in the market, all months fell by three, four, two, and six qian. The situation was even weaker in the afternoon market, with all accounts falling by 1.2.2 qian. The market rebounded when it closed. The total volume for the day was 17,200 bales. It was found that Mingde sold 800 bales, Changfeng sold 4,400 bales, and Dejiang sold 1,050 bales. Shen Ji bought 1,600 bales, Tongxing bought 600 bales, Yichang bought 400 bales, and Da Chang bought 800 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Cotton Still Falling</p>
<h3>|Factories To Deliver Soon |</h3>
<p>The cotton market fell again. The trend of U.S. cotton is softening, with mixed gains and losses. One factory is said to be delivering this month, and it is all rough-processed cotton. No one welcomes this kind of commodity, so the market suddenly took a sharp turn downwards. Distant months were also affected.</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard Continues Weakness) The Zheng Standard market opened with declines of one or two qian in all months. In the afternoon, due to the liquidation of long positions, it fell another two qian. The total volume for the day was 66,600 dan. It was found that Delong sold 6,900 dan, Yichang sold 1,000 dan, Changfeng sold 6,200 dan, Yifeng sold 1,700 dan, and Jifeng sold 4,600 dan. Jifeng bought 1,500 dan, Gengfeng bought 2,200 dan, Hengde bought 900 dan, Dafu bought 2,400 dan, and Yuanda bought 2,300 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Nanshi Cotton 30.50, Yihua Factory purchased 1,000 bales, sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>American Cotton in Unsettled State</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially strengthened quietly due to buying by peers and a lack of sellers. Later, due to liquidation by some long positions, it softened. Futures gains and losses were one or two pound notes. Spot prices were unchanged. British cotton futures rose by one point, Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by three points, and Indian cotton markets were stable due to weak pound prices. The prices of Pingleer and Aomula were down two rupees, and Bairoxi was down 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is shown on the left:</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Initially Weak, Then Strengthened</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of sources from various routes was not large, about 30. The outgoing routes in this district were initially slack and then active, the situation was one of steady decline. 500 shi of Bo Dao went upstream, and the price rose by half a jiao. The Su Tong gang and Ping Li goods were uniformly raised by one jiao. Yang Dujian's arrival and sales were light, and the market was weak. Bian Yin Yuan liquor merchants were not active, retail transactions were also light, and market prices were slightly weak.</p>
<p>(Xinzha) Yesterday, there were 25 or 26 boats from Xianglu. The city and rural shops were more active than the previous market. Changxi Beigeng's sudden price increase was allowed. Zhongguan Jiangyin rice opened with a set price. Both early and late rice arrivals and sales were flat, and the market had no ups and downs. The total volume for the day was 3,500 shi.</p>
<p>Dinggan Passenger Rice Arrivals and Sales Both Strong</p>
<h3>|Foreign Rice Production Prices Loose|</h3>
<p>Yesterday, only one foreign rice wholesale market was open for business, in this district. 100 bags of Saigon rice were still priced at 8 yuan. The stock of foreign rice is still more than 600,000 bags, but most of it cannot be sampled in the market due to issues with collateral and unresolved disputes, so circulation is not high. Owners remained steadfast. As for production area prices, due to slow sales recently, prices have also gradually fallen. Telegrams from Needgong only show 3.6 or 7 qian, and Saigon is slightly over 4 taels. Including expenses, the equivalent Shanghai price is between 8 and 9 yuan. Such low prices in the production area have not been seen for many years, but even at the equivalent Shanghai price, it is still difficult to calculate. Furthermore, due to the abundance of inventory and sluggish sales, there is no hope for orders.</p>
<p>Hunan and Jiangxi passenger rice continue to arrive daily. Yesterday, about 5,000 new bags arrived and were sampled in the market. Recently, passenger traffic has been very active, and the southern route Fuzhou and Quanzhou gangs have been eagerly handling it, with a large appetite. Yesterday, the Quanzhou gang's appetite was slightly weaker, but the Fuzhou gang was active again. The appetite of the Shandong and Hebei provinces on the northern route was even better, because rice prices were cheaper than flour prices. Yesterday, 206 bags of Jiangxi Ji Yuan were opened, priced at 9 yuan and 9 jiao. 640 bags of Ji Wan were also opened, priced at 8 yuan, 6 jiao, 3 fen to 8 yuan, 5 jiao. 200 bags of Hunan Ji Yuan were priced at 10 yuan and 5 jiao, and 1,200 bags of Ji You were priced at 8 yuan, 8 jiao, 8 fen to 8 yuan, 5 jiao. 200 bags of Ji Jinggang rice were priced at 8 yuan, 2 jiao, 3 fen, and 800 bags of Ji Red Rice were priced at 8 yuan and 5 fen, for a total of 3,546 bags, which were distributed by the northern and Fujian gangs, it is said.</p>
<p>Low Transaction Volume in the Flour Market</p>
<h3>|Bulls and Bears Both Observing|</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, each month generally showed a circling pattern. The quoted price of foreign wheat improved by about one or two jiao. However, the sentiment of both buyers and sellers was mostly to wait and see. The northern small rivers have already frozen, and the large rivers have not yet stopped traffic. At this time, flour sales cannot be strong, so the passenger gangs have no desire to continue to move. On the factory side, sales are not easy, and customers are also inactive and tend to wait and see, with no intention of selling. The current month is approaching delivery, and Fufeng is showing signs of buying in. There are few transactions in the forward months. The total volume for the day was sluggish. It is said that only around 140,000 bags were traded, indicating that both sides are rejecting each other. As a result, this month improved by 2.5 li compared to the previous day, January declined by small 2.5 li, April gained larger 2.5 li, and there were no other changes.</p>
<p>Dull Wheat Futures Market</p>
<h3>|This Month Still Firm Due to Approaching Delivery|</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, each month generally showed a state of dullness. This month is approaching delivery, and due to the scarcity of spot goods and limited deliveries, the bulls still felt firm. The opening price was flat in the morning, and it improved by two fen in the afternoon. Trading was abnormally sluggish in other months, making comparisons impossible. However, due to the improvement of foreign wheat prices, sentiment was tight. Months such as February, March and April improved by one or two fen compared to this week, but there were not many chips, and it was difficult for both sides to develop.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Rebounds</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: On Tuesday (the 22nd), Chicago wheat rose from .25 to 1.00 cents for various periods due to poor foreign wheat production conditions. The trading volume on the 21st was a total of 20 million bushels. The market prices for the 22nd are listed on the left.</p>
<p>|Closing Price|Change from Previous Day|</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>|December|43.750|Up 1.000|</p>
<p>|May|48.500|Up 0.375|</p>
<p>|July|49.625|Up 0.250|</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Raw and White Sugar Still Trending Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the sugar market, due to the firm gold standard, sentiment was still good. The guild's allocation was more buying than selling, and there was a continuing tight trend. No. 24 raw white sugar was allocated at 14 taels, 9 qian, 5 fen. Some of the goods with expiring warehouse rents were allocated out, but Changxing and other firms wanted to raise the price to 15 taels. No. 18 medium white sugar was 14 taels, flat. No. 20 medium white sugar rose to 14 taels, 4 qian, 5 fen due to dwindling inventories, an improvement of half a qian compared to the previous day. Hechi sugar No. 8, 9, and 10 was firm and unchanged. The new Chao Yangqing from Lian GanghHousie that had recently arrived had not yet been opened, and the goods were less desirable to traders due to their inferior quality, so they fell by 9 taels and 3 qian. However, entrants were still waiting and did not move forward, likely because they were not very marketable. Yesterday, the price for No. 24 ordinary raw white sugar was 14 taels and 9 qian and a half; the five taels was a misprint, and the character Yang in Huizhou Yang was mistakenly removed).</p>
<p>North-South Goods, Orchid Seeds High-Quality Goods Coming Soon</p>
<h3>|Land Prices Have Already Risen|</h3>
<p>Recently, due to a lack of continued arrivals of orchid seeds, market inventories are gradually becoming scarce. It has been found that high-quality goods with good body, color, luster, aroma, and rich flavor have already run out of stock. There are still cheaper goods available in central villages, and sales are showing a rising trend. According to letters from production areas, winter ice goods, though continuing to come out, are not large in number, and good goods have risen by three or four yuan. They are expected to be shipped to Shanghai next week, and the asking prices are bound to increase at that time, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Foreign Firms, Silk Market Dull and Lifeless</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the local foreign firm silk market, the market was increasingly dull. Since the change in the exchange market, overseas silk markets have generally cleared</p>
<h3>丨Two Seasons of Cocoons Coexist, Over 16,000 Bundles丨</h3>
<p>Since the resumption of work in various silk factories in Wuxi, all have been striving for production. However, the sales of foreign silk have weakened again. The cost of imported white silk factories has seen declines with no increases. All manufacturers believe the cost of raw silk is insufficient and are unwilling to sell at a loss. Therefore, silk inventories have increased significantly. Various manufacturers have no interest in purchasing dried cocoon materials. The cocoon market has become increasingly sluggish, with substantial dried cocoon inventories. Warehouses throughout the county reportedly hold over 16,000 bundles of spring and autumn cocoons.</p>
<h3>Domestic Factories’ Pearl Tea Sales Show Slight Movement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the "Shrimp Eye" pearl tea produced by local tea factories in Shanghai saw renewed activity. Due to receiving orders from Morocco, the British firm TONG FOO began procuring it. Over 400 boxes were traded throughout the city. The opening market price was from forty to forty-three taels, four to five taels lower than previously. Some sparse transactions of "Precious Eyebrow" and "Needle Eyebrow" teas from the LUZHUANG brand were also made by BAOCHANG and JINLONG trading houses. Except for "Needle Eyebrow," which remained firm, the market prices of other teas were difficult to maintain.</p>
<h3>The Most Popular Woolen Fabrics Recently</h3>
<p>The price fluctuations of woolen fabrics have varied recently, with some rising sharply due to shortages. Among the most popular are riding breeches, followed by genuine horsehair sleeves and women's solid-colored overcoat wool. Those who have these goods are eagerly hoarding them, considering them rare commodities, as the market supply is extremely short and sales are brisk. Those waiting to buy do not mind the high prices and are purchasing them regardless. The average price of the above three types of goods has risen by more than one-tenth of a silver dollar. Other items, such as Hanling Peng (套頭呢之漢令蓬), leather-faced double cloth (皮面兩布), and pre-made Western-style overcoat wool (預等西裝大衣呢), and leopard-skin wool (豹皮羢) are also showing good trends.</p>

<p>Discourse</p>
<h3>Amnesia</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>According to yesterday's report, "In the United States, there is a patient suffering from amnesia who has even forgotten his beloved wife and nephew. This person is Colonel Robbins, a famous social economist. Today, when his wife arrived, after entering the room, Mr. Robbins called himself Rogers. Although he exchanged greetings with Mrs. Robbins, he did not recognize her as his wife." This made me think of our country where someone moved his family and forgot his wife. I once laughed and said that this must not be true and was not credible. Now, seeing Rogers not recognizing his wife and children, it is truly an example of things happening in the world. It may not be something ancient people made up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I think that the disease of amnesia is not only something that ancient people had, nor is it just something that happens in the United States. Even now, many people in our country suffer from amnesia, and very few do not. Foreigners laugh at our countrymen for having "five-minute heat," which shows that our countrymen only have a five-minute memory. After this, everything is either forgotten. Not only can one forget one's beloved wife, but one can also forget the country, forget the vengeance for one's father, and forget one's own life and property. Looking at our country, once a national humiliation occurs, a slogan of economic severance, etc., will immediately emerge. But how long does it last? It soon vanishes like smoke. The deepening of amnesia is truly unparalleled in our country.</p>

<h3>Sentiments at the Year's End</h3>
<p>— Chen Baoren</p>
<p>Roaming the lakes and seas, my enthusiasm has waned, unable to bear the year's end as a traveler on the riverbank. The outbreak of war has shattered my heart, and talk of human relationships chills my bones. The vicissitudes of the nation and family are shocking transformations, and the shattered rivers and mountains, who will complete them? Saddened, I gaze north at the many misty trees, and rising to dance at the crowing of the rooster, my tears are not yet dry.</p>
<h3>Evening Vista</h3>
<p>Alarmed by the days of the raging sea, my aspirations to serve the country are difficult to fulfill. Withered in the setting sun of the western wind, a few sounds of broken-hearted pounding of the washing stone.</p>
<h3>Sleeplessness</h3>
<p>The short lamp and flickering candle are lonely and boring, and the sound of night rain outside the curtain is rustling. I stroke my pillow, unable to sleep for no reason, and the cold quilt is as hard as iron, bearing the deep night.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge</p>
<h3>Points to Note When Using a Stove</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>After reading Renjun's "On Gas Poisoning and First Aid," I offer these points to those who use stoves.</p>
<p>The cold and frightening winter, especially on days of wind and snow, who doesn't like to gather around the stove for warmth? But how do they know that when the windows are tightly closed and the stove fire is roaring, the lack of oxygen causes carbon dioxide to be reduced to carbon monoxide? This colorless and odorless gas, when inhaled into the body, often leads to fatal danger. Therefore, it is best not to have a stove in winter. If you must have one, you should follow the following points to avoid danger.</p>
<p>1.  The stove must have a chimney. Because after coal burns, carbon dioxide is produced. If it is not dispersed outside through a chimney, the coal stove will continue to burn, and it will be reduced to carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide will not turn into carbon dioxide in air lacking oxygen. If we inhale this gas into the human body, it will combine with hemoglobin in the blood and become carboxyhemoglobin. Because hemoglobin originally has the function of transporting oxygen to supply heat to the human body, once it changes, the exchange of carbon and oxygen in the body makes breathing hurried, from hurried to difficult, and from difficult to stopping. When breathing stops, life is cut off. Therefore, anyone who wants to have a stove for warmth must have a chimney.</p>
<p>2.  A pot of clean water must be placed on the stove. Because after the coal in the stove burns, the indoor air will definitely be dry, which can cause diseases of the skin and mucous membranes, such as rhinitis and laryngitis. With a pot of clean water, the steam of the water can humidify the air and regulate dryness.</p>
<p>3.  Keep the windows open. Because the chimney's ability is only to send the carbon dioxide and other substances produced after burning out of the room. If the windows are tightly closed, the indoor air is limited, and the oxygen in the air is also limited. The burning of coal relies on oxygen, and at the same time, oxygen is for human combustion. When the oxygen is used up, fresh air from outside cannot enter the room, and the carbon in the room cannot be discharged outside. The result is the same danger.</p>
<p>In the past, many people in various places died from coal stove gas poisoning, which was nothing more than the above reasons. Therefore, everyone, it is better not to have a stove. If you want to have one, you must strictly abide by the above points to avoid dying in vain. Everyone, remember!</p>
<h3>Several Essays</h3>
<p>— Wenbing</p>
<p>(1) The Story of the Rice Bowl</p>
<p>Yesterday, I ran into Mr. D at the North Railway Station, whom I had not seen for a whole year. He asked me abruptly, "How are you?" "I'm fine, but bread is a bit of a problem. How about you?" "As for me, I only have a rice bowl left." He said humorously, "This makes me confused. What exactly happened?" "You know that I used to live on Baoshan Road. When the January 28th Incident broke out, I escaped as a naked man. Later, when the Japanese devils retreated, I went back to take a look. All my belongings had turned into a pile of ashes. After rummaging through it, I only found a rice bowl that I used at school. It was so heartbreaking! Fortunately, just as the enemy was burning and killing, our Mr. × came to power. Later, my uncle also got a position at this station. So, I took the only rice bowl I had and squeezed in." "Ah, your rice bowl is still valuable! Although...although..." He nodded hastily and went to the station.</p>
<p>(2) Dock Fist</p>
<p>Elementary school students, Shi E acts as a modern school beauty, a combination of Chinese and Western styles, a young master style, athlete's attire, and Western-style college students.</p>
<p>The clothing of our country's students has no fixed rules. Everyone freely wears casual clothes, which has become such a disorganized phenomenon.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Shanghai has many idlers who specialize in finding business opportunities in the streets and alleys, docks, and stations. They are most active when foreign ships arrive at the dock. There are policemen stationed at the dock, so they don't dare to be too presumptuous. However, most of the carriages and horses are always parked on the opposite side of the dock. Passengers hand over their luggage to the coachmen, and just as they are about to get into the carriage, two or three idlers will suddenly pop out and say fiercely, "Be sensible and quickly hand over the dock fee, or we'll use a gun!" In this way, countless countrymen have been extorted by them. Mr. Guan came from Hankou last week, and idlers surrounded him. Fortunately, he wasn't stupid, and a policeman arrived, so he only suffered a beating. Now, every time I meet Mr. Guan, he always says, "The idlers' dock fist really hurts."</p>
<p>(3) White Russian Beggars</p>
<p>It is said that there are more than 9,000 White Russians stranded in Shanghai. Apart from a portion who rely on public buses and tram strikes to搶搶开车的生意, and apart from a portion who sell felt carpets and soap, the rest can only beg in the streets. The Chinese are very generous. I have seen some coolies throw them several copper coins, probably because they are "foreigners." Yesterday, I walked past Datong Road and suddenly encountered two of them. They said, "You are Chinese, I am Russian. Chinese and Russians are the same!" Then, they said softly, "Please give me a copper coin!" I was furious and said, "You used to be Russian dignitaries. Do you know about the Treaty of Ili between China and Russia?" They walked away, muttering a lot of Russian.</p>
<p>(4) Younger Brother Supports Older Brother</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a person who is severely disabled, or is blind and deaf, or has a broken hand and is lame, or whose whole body is simply born like a turtle, is undoubtedly a consumer of society. How can he talk about helping others? A few days ago, I passed by Sampan New Bridge and discovered a disabled person who looked like a turtle. His hands and feet were less than a foot long, and his head was no more than a large pear. He was sleeping in a cradle, and a tall and strong person was pushing him from door to door to beg for food. The pusher was his older brother, who lived his entire life by relying on his disabled younger brother. This can be considered "younger brother supporting older brother."</p>
<h3>About Almanacs</h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>"Every family uses it, you can't buy it in China."</p>
<p>"Opening-year new almanac, buy one for eight coppers." Hearing the speculative vendors shouting to sell old and new almanacs on the road made me realize that the light of this year had come to an end. The words "old almanac" made me feel that human inertia was difficult to eradicate.</p>
<p>In a feudal society, in China where the rural economy was the foundation, what dominated the minds of most people was not the philosophy of Laozi and Zhuangzi, nor the classics of Confucianism, let alone any new doctrines, but an almanac. A person uses it from birth until old age. No, they still have to use it after death for funerals, burials, and ancestral rites. In short, apart from birth and death, where one cannot freely choose a good day as the two major flaws, other actions must always consult the almanac to pick a perfect day. For weddings, birthdays, building houses, and raising beams, one must of course look at the auspicious and inauspicious days. Even for haircuts, baths, seeking wealth, and traveling, one must choose an auspicious day. This is the only classic among all groups of people who have lost confidence. Therefore, the almanac is a popular textbook of superstition. Correspondingly, there are strange phenomena such as fortune-telling witchcraft. Because if the almanac did not have those stems, branches, five elements, Buddhist birthdays, auspicious and inauspicious omens, etc., then those who rely on this to make a living would lose the basis for their activities. This is not without benefit to the upward movement of society. Regarding the superstition of almanacs, I once saw the following story in a notebook:</p>
<p>Someone named Jia was very superstitious. No matter what he did, he would check the almanac for auspicious and inauspicious omens to determine whether to go or stay. One day, a relative's family had an important matter that required him to be there. However, after checking the almanac, it happened to be a day that was not suitable for traveling. Fortunately, he thought of a way. He climbed out of the wall, thinking that as long as I didn't go out through the gate, I could avoid the taboo. However, the dilapidated wall, coupled with days of rain, was not very strong. Before he could climb over, the wall had already collapsed, crushing Jia underneath. At this time, his son heard the sound and rushed over to help, using a hoe to rake away the loose bricks that were pressing on Jia. However, although Jia was pressed under the loose bricks, his mind was very clear. He gasped and shouted to his son,</p>
<p>"Wait...wait a moment! Please...first go...check...the almanac...to see...if...we can move earth...today..."</p>
<p>Although this is a joke, people who believe in the almanac do indeed have this kind of devotion. I record it here for amusement.</p>
<p>The Answer of the Vase</p>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<h3>|Why Be a Vase?|</h3>
<p>Since female employees were hired in the capital's agencies, many publications and supplements have discussed it extensively. And their conclusion is: why be a "vase?" The supporting side says that this is the beginning of women's employment. Since men and women are equal, they can of course work in the same agency. However, women are relatively weaker, so their work cannot advance as fast as men's. The opposing side says why don't women do other things well and want to put on makeup and dress up like butterflies, providing entertainment for the big managers.</p>
<p>Yesterday I met a former classmate of mine, she was the captain of the basketball team in school, and had the reputation of "healthy beauty girl", but after a year away, she has changed from the dress of short skirt and basketball shoes to a modern woman in long robes and high leather heels. We talked from school life to the current level of life, and learned that she is also a vase in a certain company, so I wanted to find my answer and asked her: "Why be a vase?"</p>
<p>"We also know the meaning of the capitalists": she replied to me, "They want to use our appearance to call on customers, didn't the Parker department of a certain company become crowded after hiring female employees? Also, when the managers are bored, they can use us for entertainment, haven't there been news of a certain minister forcibly kissing a female employee? This is of course a shame for our women, you see there are many women who rush to it now, and they are all educated to a middle school level, but onlookers should also think from the opposite side, are we women not afraid of shame? (exceptions aside) Also for the problem of bread, if there is a proper career, I think our women may not all be willing to be "vases", let me give an analogy, like many middle school graduates like you, also for the problem of overcrowding in society, they have to sell their writing to make a living, to put it badly, they are "literary beggars", but why are there so many people willing to be "literary beggars"? In short, it's all for the problem of bread."</p>
<p>I have organized her words into the above answer. I hope that the insulting name of "vase" will no longer be found anywhere, especially for our writing comrades, if they want to write something about "vase", they should think that they are also "literary beggars" who are looked down upon by others.</p>
<h3>Random Writings</h3>
<p>— Xiaoniu</p>
<p>Students are unwilling to yield to others in two places: one is in sports on the playground, where no one lets anyone go first; the other is eating in the dining hall, where no one lets anyone have more chopsticks. These two places are proving grounds for students' abilities.</p>
<p>The toilets in schools are the central mechanism for students' freedom of publication. Their critical remarks about teachers and classmates can be seen on the walls of these toilets, such as slogans like "Down with ×× rice bucket" and "××× bastard."</p>
<p>The discipline department of a school is like a police station, and the discipline officer is like a patrolling policeman. His cold face makes students fearful upon seeing him, as if he is about to devour them. Therefore, some people say that this kind of discipline is the spirit of a teacher combined with law.</p>
<p>Students who are good at sports often show off their skills on the sports field; students who are good at writing often vent their frustrations in newspapers. These are both ways for modern students to show off.</p>
<p>Many teachers, apart from the few hours they spend in class for money and can see students, disappear quietly with their briefcases as soon as the bell rings, irresponsibly, and have nothing to do with students. These teachers see teaching as a business, not as a task.</p>
<p>When teachers meet students on the street, they always look down or turn their heads away, pretending not to have seen them. If a student gives him a bow from afar, he has already seen it, and gives a forced, half-smiling nod. Haha.</p>

<h3>Poor and Arduous Practice When People Aren't Looking</h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>The fundamental way to learn a foreign language is to first memorize the alphabet, and then one can spell words and read books. The fundamental way to learn dramatic expression is also similar. One must first take the simplest emotions as units, practice them one by one until they are mature, and then one can further practice complex expressions.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, before you practice the following expressions, you must prepare a large mirror that can reflect your whole body (whether it is a folding dressing mirror or a dressing mirror on a wardrobe is fine). If your economic ability cannot afford it, or you cannot close the door to practice quietly in the place where that large mirror is placed, then it is best to hang a mirror that can reflect your whole face on the wall in a room where you can practice alone. It is best to have it at the same height as your eyes when you are standing. If you can't do that either, you can always find a target about the size of a nail head at the height of your eyes when you are standing in a place where you can practice alone. When you practice alone, you may as well concentrate your gaze on that target. The results obtained from this kind of poor and arduous practice may be more powerful than the results of practicing in front of a large dressing mirror in a large Western-style house. To be honest, the teacher can only teach you a method. Success is created by the student's own strong will and perseverance.</p>
<p>However, one point must be noted. If your concentrated target is any object other than the mirror, you must often look for opportunities outside of practice, and when people are not prepared, practice the few expressions you have already practiced in front of the mirror once or twice. As long as you don't deliberately attract the attention of others, maybe others won't notice you. Haven't you seen some people who often like to raise their eyebrows and glare their eyes in front of the mirror? As long as you don't explain that you are concentrating on practicing a skill there, jealous ridicule and scolding may not be triggered.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of *High Pressure*</h3>
<p>— Yannan</p>
<p>*High Pressure*, which premiered at the Cathay yesterday, is William Powell's first work for Warner Bros. after leaving Paramount. The story can be said to be very ordinary; it can also be said to be very complex, and the business it depicts is indeed often seen in culturally advanced cities. This kind of business is the so-called "slick business". Its reality everywhere satirizes those large stores/companies that are strong on the outside but empty on the inside: only caring about the facade; and the goods they operate, apart from the "sample rooms" used to decorate some, are actually empty. It scolds those nominal stores and blind investors. But the so-called inside story is not that much.</p>
<p>In addition, it also sketches the jealousy and infighting of the same industry. These are unavoidable and undeniable treacherous facts in the economic society. Also, the modern popular vanity disease, especially among women, is also shown in detail.</p>
<p>William Powell is still the William Powell of the past. He is very experienced in playing a shrewd and sinister businessman: a thoughtful and steady attitude that no one in Hollywood can match. George Sidney plays a very heavy role in this film, but he handles it with ease and serves as a good assistant to William. As for the rest of the people, there is nothing to talk about: they are merely competent. The photographic lighting is also mediocre.</p>
<p>Many of the interspersed scenes are similar to "hard comedy": of course, this is a goal of Warner Bros. films (short comedies). But they are not unreasonable or annoying, but make people feel happier.</p>
<p>Its problem is that there is too much dialogue about "business experience" (the pronunciation is very good), which makes the scene a bit deserted. The ending seems finished but not finished. Although the flashback is not bad, it will definitely cause people's dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>In short, it is a film that capitalists or businessmen must see!</p>

<h3>Shoot a Film of the Bloody Battle of the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>— Daosheng</p>
<p>In the past six months, many cinemas operated by Chinese nationals in this city have been showing war films about the January 28th Incident, such as *The Anti-Japanese War History of the 19th Route Army*, *A Soldier of the 19th Route Army*, and *The Bloody Battle of Shanghai*. These films can undoubtedly attract the general public.</p>
<h3>Lost My Lover with a Car</h3>
<p>— Buwu</p>
<p>Rapper Fando is back in Hollywood! Guess what she brought back? A brand-new Duesenberg car; a very gorgeous black sable fur coat; and many beautiful and precious rubies.</p>
<p>Rapper said: "None of the men in Hollywood can arouse my interest." In fact, she has taken a fancy to Bert Taylor. She had to leave New York and her lover because she wanted to go to Hollywood to shoot a new film.</p>
<p>Audience, and on the one hand it can excite the emotions of the audience, giving a strong and tragic stimulus. These films have not failed to help in the salvation of the national crisis. But I think it is not enough, and there is further expectation.</p>
<p>My opinion... I hope that major domestic film companies will quickly produce several films about the bloody battles of the Northeast Volunteer Army. The heroic and mighty spirit of the Northeast Volunteer Army, the arduous and extraordinary struggle of the Northeast Volunteer Army, how they fought hand-to-hand with stubborn enemies in the wilderness or mountains, how they fought great battles in single clothes in the ice and snow: all kinds of spirits of fighting and sacrificing for the country should be captured on camera and made active on the screen. Even if it is not possible to actually go to the Northeast Volunteer Army's position for production, efforts should be made to make it lifelike, and the more tragic it is, the better.</p>
<p>In fact, in this time of serious national crisis, all hot-blooded blockbusters, song and dance blockbusters, and films that play around with love are empty dramas that do not help the facts, and are only for the wealthy and leisurely classes to enjoy. What is most needed now are films that can uplift the national spirit.</p>

<h3>A Short Biography of Martial Arts Star Cha Ruilong</h3>
<p>— Shi Mengyuan</p>
<p>Martial arts star Cha Ruilong is a native of Dinghai, Zhejiang. He was born and raised in Shanghai. At the age of fourteen, he enrolled in the Shanggong Primary School, affiliated with the Commercial Press. He enjoyed practicing martial arts from a young age. Li Weisheng, the school's Chinese martial arts instructor, greatly admired him and provided him with dedicated guidance. After graduation, he studied at Cheng Tian Middle School. However, he dropped out due to other reasons shortly after and pursued a career in architecture. This was not his passion, and he would practice martial arts whenever he had free time. Later, he became a disciple of the old boxing master Tong Zhongyi of Cangzhou. Within four years, his skills greatly improved. He participated in martial arts competitions at the Universal Sports Association and defeated all his opponents. Spectators were amazed by his bravery.</p>
<p>At that time, a Westerner wanted to take Cha abroad, but Cha refused, believing the offer lacked sincerity. Later, he gathered several like-minded individuals and founded the National Martial Arts Research Association, inviting his master Tong Zhongyi to serve as the head coach. He also served as the director of the martial arts department at the Commercial Press, nurturing many talents. In the seventeenth year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1928], when the Northern Expeditionary Army arrived in Shanghai, the film industry held a theatrical performance to entertain the Northern Expeditionary generals and soldiers. Cha joined the performance and became famous throughout Shanghai for his unique skills. Later, he served as the director of the martial arts department at the Yueming Film Company, co-starring with Wu Lizhu in "The Hero of Guandong," achieving remarkable success and earning high praise from the public. He is only in his early twenties and looks like a refined scholar. Those who do not know him would hardly believe he is the powerful Cha Ruilong.</p>

<h3>Janet Gaynor's Latest Decision Regarding Her Acting Style</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhiji</p>
<p>Janet Gaynor thought that she was capable of playing not only lively, innocent girls, but also the roles that Norma Shearer, Constance Bennett, Joan Crawford, and others could play. Therefore, she repeatedly resolved to change her acting style; however, she has now abandoned her proposition.</p>
<p>Starting with her successful film "Seventh Heaven," she continued to play roles, whether she was playing a cute girl-next-door or a lonely orphan; she was always a lovable "Diana." After her success, she became fickle and wanted to change her acting style.</p>
<p>The film company complied with her wishes and gave her a</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>film called "The Man Who Comes Back," but it failed. She had lost her lovable spirit on screen!</p>
<p>Despite the failure, she remained determined not to continue with the "Janet Gaynor style" of acting. Critics said she had to maintain the style she had in "Seventh Heaven," but she ignored them.</p>
<p>Recently, Fox Film Corporation bought a script for her, "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm." The character Rebecca was most suitable for her personality; however, she was unwilling to take it on. She took "The First Year of Marriage," which was originally intended for Sally Eilers and James Dunn, and the script that the company had intended for her was given to Marlene Dietrich.</p>
<p>Although the premiere is still far away, people returning from the filming location say that Marlene's performance is no less impressive than Janet's.</p>
<p>Marlene is not the only one competing with Janet; Lilian Harvey, who came to Hollywood from Europe, is also competing with Janet. Lilian previously received the same kind of praise as Janet for her performance in "Congress Dances."</p>
<h3>Ronald Colman Is Also Afraid of Death, Having Taken Out a Life Insurance Policy for One Million Dollars</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Ronald Colman's "Movie Crazy" opened today at the Grand and Nanking theaters simultaneously. Because filming this movie involved many dangers, he took out a life insurance policy for a total of one million dollars. He said that the value of a person's life is inestimable; therefore, a person's insurance should be as high as possible without limitation. Ronald Colman's one-million-dollar insurance policy is not the highest in the American film industry because Will Rogers, John Barrymore, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Bessie Love and others all have life insurance policies worth over one million dollars.</p>
<p>Many people say that Sally Eilers and James Dunn may film "Janet-style" movies and succeed. At the same time, Joan Bennett also intends to make a "Janet-style" movie.</p>
<p>Janet wants to preserve her past glory and stand above those who imitate her style. At the same time, because of public criticism, she has been asked to retain her previous style. Therefore, she has decided to abandon her intention to change her style and continue playing the kind of innocent, lively, and blossoming young woman. Therefore, we will soon be able to see the Janet of "Seventh Heaven" again.</p>
<h3>Star Film Company's New Film "Humanitarian Thief, Starring Yan Yuexian"</h3>
<p>Movie Trivia</p>
<h3>John Gilbert's Cunning Plan</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>A year ago, John Gilbert felt that his position was wavering. Many audiences no longer supported him, and some even scolded or ridiculed him. The film company tried its best to find out why a big star who had been praised for years was suddenly rejected. However, there was no way to remedy the situation, and no one knew the reason why.</p>
<p>Later, John discovered the reason himself. He wrote a novel in which he made himself the protagonist, saying, "He is a very sinister person whose behavior is extremely cunning. He is so bad that he is rejected by society." This novel became popular in the United States and received good reviews. After reading it, audiences liked him again because he admitted his own cunning.</p>
<p>Now he has returned to the peak of his former glory and is loved by audiences. But no one would have thought that loving him was precisely falling for his cunning plan.</p>
<h3>What Does Your First Time Taste Like?</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Edna May Oliver has never kissed anyone on screen before. But in the new film "Hold 'Em Jail," she made an exception and held her "first screen kiss" ceremony.</p>
<p>Just Chatting</p>
<h3>Why Do People Like Watching Foreign Movies?</h3>
<p>— Xidiao</p>
<p>Perhaps this is not a question worth discussing for you all. Why do people like watching foreign movies? Actually, this is indeed a question worth discussing.</p>
<p>In our country, which lacks investigation and statistics, there are of course no investigations or statistics regarding how many foreign films are imported each year, and how much money flies into the pockets of foreigners without them lifting a finger. However, everyone knows that the number is surprisingly large.</p>
<p>I once asked many friends in the education sector, and they only responded with giggles. It seemed that they had forgotten that movies are a tool of public education because this was something outside of their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I unintentionally chatted with a friend about this question that had been lingering in my mind for a long time. Thanks to his guidance, he gave me a clear answer. Ah, from this I know that it all comes from the gifts of our education.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that in our schools, we almost disdain studying Chinese; while we happen to take the opposite stance towards English. Starting from middle school, students will buy some English books, and at the same time, everyone will put on a navy blue serge Western suit that seems to make them look like a young gigolo. Having understood English and wearing a Western suit, even if one's English is not fluent, one will still say a few sentences in "pidgin English." Everything else must also try to catch up with foreigners. For the sake of practical research, watching foreign movies is a good move from several perspectives. Haha! Isn't this the reason?</p>
<p>Editor's Note: This may be one of many reasons, but it should not be generalized.</p>
<h3>Greta Garbo's Mourning After Paul Bern's Suicide</h3>
<p>— Meicun</p>
<p>Paul Bern's sudden suicide was a shock that Hollywood had never experienced. He was a film producer and the husband of actress Jean Harlow. He died on September 6th, only two months after they were married! Paul was one of Hollywood's most fashionable figures. Because of his generosity and frequent assistance to others in need, he earned the title "The Kindest Hearted Man in a Heartless Town." More than a thousand people came to offer flowers at his memorial service. Since her husband's death, it was generally said by Hollywood colleagues and outsiders that Jean Harlow's film life would come to a halt, but Jean was not discouraged. She admired Billie Burke's courage (Billie continued to film "A Bill of Divorcement" after her husband Florenz Ziegfeld's death). Therefore, she also continued filming "Red Dust." (The male lead is Clark Gable). However, the sadness she felt was too deep, so on her first day back to filming, a special nurse was assigned to carefully watch over her, to prevent her nerves from collapsing. Her stepfather, Marino Bello, also often followed her closely, to prevent accidents. Now she is gradually recovering, and the film is progressing smoothly.</p>
<p>Theater Knowledge</p>
<h3>The Three Bad Habits of Moviegoers in Theaters</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>1.  Reading Subtitles Aloud: Most people who go to the movies are literate. However, some moviegoers who know a few words like to pretend to be smart. When they see the subtitles on the screen, they hum and read them aloud like an old woman chanting scriptures! This makes the audience in the surrounding seats unable to concentrate on watching the movie. Therefore, in American movie theaters, there is a regulation that those who read subtitles aloud will be charged with disturbing the peace and fined twenty-five US dollars. As a result, order in American movie theaters is very quiet, without any noisy sounds.</p>
<p>2.  Inappropriate Jeering: Sometimes, when a movie has been shown many times, or it is an old film, it is often interrupted halfway through the showing. Therefore, when the audience is watching something interesting, they become annoyed by the interruption. Some idlers even boo loudly, and even clap their hands and stomp their feet, causing the order to fall into a state of unrest. The reason for this is partly because the film is too old, or the operator is negligent, and partly because the audience has no sense of public morality.</p>
<p>3.  Leaving Before It's Over: It seems that everyone who goes to the movies is a busy person. Why is that? Because when the movie is about to end but hasn't finished, they all stand up one after another in preparation to leave, preventing the audience in the back rows from seeing! The reason for this is probably that some moviegoers have read the synopsis beforehand and know that a certain scene is about to end, so they stand up and leave first. While this is probably correct, it seems inappropriate to obstruct the view of others.</p>
