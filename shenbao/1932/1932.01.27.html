<p>顏惠慶提示採用會章其他條文之必要國聯請中日兩政府消弭上海重大事變</p>
<p>國聯行政會</p>
<h3 id="c2">全塲空氣嚴重 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政會今日開會討論滿洲時局時、全塲滿佈極嚴重之空氣、與會者及旁聽者咸了解目前此問題之嚴重、會議自午後五時三刻起、至八時止、共歷兩小時有奇、全塲人士費此全部時間、靜聆中代表顏惠慶博士之陳訴、與日代表佐藤之答覆、顏博士係中國駐美公使、現充中國總代表、佐藤係日本駐比大使現代有芳澤之地位、顏博士稱、關於滿案之事實最初即明白無疑、中國唯有在備戰及信任條約與國聯兩者之間擇一行之、中國非軍事强國、故請訴於國聯、渠現請行政會對於中國之權利、予以考量之承認、中國諒解在會章第一條下謀取解决之相宜、但進而採用會章其他條文下所可有的各種權利與救濟法之必要現巳日臻迫切云、</p>
<p>行政會會議將畢時、法代表彭古代白里安爲議長、聲稱、國聯現請中日兩政府盡力阻止上海發生新重大事變、上海有公共租界與法租界、形勢極複雜也云、國聯方面以爲時局己甚糾紛、上海近事愈使之嚴重、惟在此事詳情未提交行政會正式注意時、未必能有驚人發展也、</p>
<h3 id="c3">顏惠慶作沈痛演說 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>開會之初、行政會决定暫不考慮萊比利亞奴制報告書、庶各會員可專處理滿洲問題、旋即請顏博士發言、顏詞甚流利謂尋常觀察者或視爲地方事件發生於距歐美大中心點甚遠之區域者之一事、今巳在四個月内變爲對於世界和平極有危險之一問題、令人人皆知九月十八日滿洲事件僅爲一國悍然實施其所預定的侵犯他國土地完整程序之初步、日本以兵力佔據有二千萬人民之中國土地二十萬方哩、此種事實自始即無疑義、行政會以忍耐誠懇之形式、費去六星期、經二十次會議、專作依良心而行之努力、以整理此爭端、全體一致通過兩次議案、皆以日人所發儘速撤退軍隊之莊嚴諾言爲根據、、但此諾言巳破壞無遺、不獨不陸續撤兵且逐漸增兵自六星期前行政會開會以來、侵略繼續悍然進行、誠如美國務卿所言、中政府在南滿所剩最後政權、卒被摧毁、錦州及其以南土地如山海關等、現皆步瀋陽長春安東吉林齊齊哈爾等之後塵、日本現尚侵犯熱河省而危及中國北部中部與南部之要區其最近威嚇、爲福州與上海之佔據近來連接不斷的發展及日本之公然陳說其侵略政策、欲强迫中國聽其呑併滿洲、並欲威脅中國中央與地方當道取締中國人民因受日本不堪忍耐的横暴攻擊而激起情感之一切表示者、巳摧毁世人所抱時局不致愈臻嚴重之種種期望、自十二月一日起、事態日形惡劣、而行政會之議案且被日本有意反抗、中政府對於國聯調查團至少非至四月間不能抵滿洲一層、不能不表示最深刻之失望、以其出發旣遲、而調查團又宣佈不欲由最快之路、前往被侵與被蹂躏之土地也、日本佔據滿洲、其所持之理由、時常更變、初謂鐵路被攻、繼謂自衛、再謂日僑生命財産之安全、終謂盜匪、其實此皆日人遁詞而己日本欲制止抵貨、但世界未有能强使其人民購其所不欲購之政府、中國人民憤怒己極、非可以言語形容、然國内絶無暴動、此乃應視爲可異者也、日本固主張滿洲之門户開放、但此門户爲爭先恐後之日人所充塞、非他人所能通過也云</p>
<h3 id="c4">日本代表佐藤答詞 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>日代表佐藤答詞頗長、首述滿洲與上海之現有地位繼謂錦州之佔據乃暫時事、日本將維持門户開放政策、日本無土地野心、但决計以滿洲爲華人日人及他國人可在和平與安全中共圖發展之地、在軍縮會議將開時、此問題如是提出、渠以爲憾、顏博士所稱日本以區區二萬五千兵佔據滿洲二十萬方哩一說實屬奇談、要知滿洲仍爲滿洲、中國人民依然在彼、而許多城邑亦仍有華人官史、不過中國行政機關受一挫折耳、佐藤繼詳言錦州地位及日軍前進之地位、謂中國前外長顧維鈞所發華兵可撤入關内之第一提議、惜未實行、日軍本巳撤入鐵路區域、但常爲非正式與正式軍隊及警察義勇兵與土匪所攻擊、則日軍司令祇有一條路可走耳、錦州之佔據乃張學良方面侵略的挑釁之自然而不可免的結果、日軍爲錦州居民所歡迎雖警察曾暫時繳械、但現巳發還、警察現復負維持公安之責任、日兵祇駐於城門及車站而己云、佐藤繼詳言滿洲匪患之蔓延、謂日軍旣巳開始剿匪、不能半途中止云、佐藤承認上海形勢甚爲吃緊、但謂中國當道對於民衆施行有統系的煽惑、乃禍亂之根、其激怒日人至危險程度者、爲上海某華字報紙紀炸彈謀炸日皇事之標題文、爲不幸擊中副車、中國當道提倡排外之後果、必屬不幸、日人己表示極大之忍耐、但此政策徒鼓勵華人未來之侵犯耳、日本决計保護其人民不受侵擾、列强皆曾派艦遣兵前往中國保護其人民、日本現被抨擊、指其欲佔據滿洲、關閉門户、但此種責言全非事實、日本實欲維持門户開放之政策、而使滿洲成爲中日及他國人民在和平安全中謀取進步與發展之地、日本曾與中國明白交換意見、以期解决各種未决問題、但中國拒絶之、而煽成强暴無匹之民衆運動云、</p>
<h3 id="c5">行政會不變更立塲 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>散會後、有以行政會將採何種行動詢諸某會員者、某會員答稱、國聯態度當然爲中代表所採地位所左右、但國聯調查團現將出發就地調查、故行政會或不必在調查團報告未到以前變更其立塲云、（二十五日路透社電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）本日晨間國聯會行政院舉行秘密會議、討論中日爭端、中日兩國代表均未出席、各會員似贊成一種意見、以爲行政院當將去歲十二月十日以前發生各事、包括在巴黎開會時雙方當事國所同意通過之决議案以内、不必再行追溯、一般人相信行政院目今最爲注意者、厥爲關係上海命運事件、中日兩國代表對於上海情形、均認爲隨時可變成危急、十二委員會自今日起、即以全力注重此點、行政院與其主席曁國聯會秘書處之願望、均在設法使上海所受之威脅、不致更形嚴重、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>本届國聯會如無辦法</p>
<p>將與日進行直接談判</p>
<p>國難會議時提請公决</p>
<p>（南京）某社探悉中央對日方針、連日談話會討論、步調己漸趨一致、僉以國聯在事實旣難達到仰强之境地、欲望行開目前之僵局、非另開新的途徑、不足以展開局勢、聞其步驟、將先在本届國聯會中觀其有無妥善方法、爲盟約最後之保障、否則我國擬請日方先行停止東省之一切軍事行動、再由日政府向國聯自動撤回所謂五項原則、同時收東在東省全部軍事、恢復中國政府相當之政權、在東省安寗狀態中、與絶對非武力控制之下、由國聯中立國之監視、雙方進行直接談判、關於日本侵略中國土地原因之商議、謀正義之解决、關此問題、政府雖抱不喪權失土之主旨、仍恐人民方面發生對直接交涉、誤爲城下之盟、將於國難會議時、首先提出不得己之苦衷、請求公决、俾政府得資依據云、（二十六日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）對日方針三途、（一）依賴國聯、（二）斷絶國交、（三）另闢新途徑、將提二十七日之中政會作一具體之决定、又以國聯能否可恃、專賴本届行政院會議、在兩星期内有無調解新途徑、而爲國聯能否維護盟約最終之試騐、至遼案調查團效果、恐難如吾人之期待、因該團調查時間、預定八九月後、始能竣事、急病請慢醫、於事無濟、又以調查之範圍、不限於遼案發生之事實、竟包括中日兩國一切問題、將來不免引起案外之枝節、益使東北問題有長夜多夢之感云、（二十六日專電）</p>

<p>南京據熟悉國際政治者云、國聯現雖再度開幕、討論中日問題、但國聯欲維持本身威信、停止日方軍事行動、須於短期内、關一新途徑、毅然解决中日事件、若仍沿用過去舊辦法、或依國際調查團之最後報告而處理、可斷言必無圓滿結果、因此次國際調查團之使命、恐不能達我國之希望、就時間言、該團須三月初方可抵華、如此則日方得延長軍事行動、而中日事件更不能迅速解决、再從該團責任範圍言、本應就去年九一八以後事實詳細調查、而該團竟擴大責任範圍、凡中日一切問題、無不在調查之内、未免超越權限、有失調查本意、再該團之性質、與國際會議尤逈不相同、因該團責職猶法庭之法官、僅能就事實法理經濟社會等確實情形盡量調查有一正確報告、供國聯之參考而己、（二十六日專電）</p>

<p>於「千呼萬喚」之催駕聲中。蔣汪於杭州集議之後。聯袂入京。中央始稍稍呈現活氣。政局始稍稍有轉機。乃蔣汪剛至。行政院長孫科則又忽以辭職聞。政局之離奇變幻。誠令人無從思議。無從捉摸。</p>
<p>溯自去歲寗粤分裂。擾攘紛爭。九一八事件發生。以外患之刺激。和平之使。乃僕僕道途。輾磋商。粤方仍終始堅持以蔣下野爲先决條件。一若「斯人不去。禍患不巳」者。終於蔣氏引退。政局急轉直下。新政府艱難産生。而黨國要人。則又一時都病。胡病於粤。汪病於滬。蔣則優游於妙高台上。獨樂。其樂中樞空虚主政無人。一切散漫如沙。無從進行。於是而敦促三領袖入京之呼聲。又應時而起。勸駕之使。不絶於途。即孫氏亦以促蔣入京。曾親去杭州。斯時之情勢則又有若「斯人不出如蒼生何」者。今汪蔣己入京矣。且己問政矣。而孫氏以同於責任内閣之行政院長。則忽又怱怱來滬。怱怱辭職。隨之而起者。則又爲挽留勸駕。匝月以來。外交日趨緊迫。而政府當局則日忙於謙避與勸駕。時而反對。時而歡迎。時而積極。時而灰心。悲歡離合。變化萬態吾人誠不知政府當局其爲作捉迷藏之戲耶。抑爲同犯悲喜無常之小兒病耶。或政府當局皆爲醉人。故扶得東來西又倒耶。處此情勢之下。吾人誠是非莫辨。笑啼皆非。自九一八禍變發生迄今。黨國領袖。無日不以和平統一精誠團結共赴國難昭告國人。然而證之事實。則彼來此去。各懷鬼胎。一若冰之於炭。絶不相容。今外交情勢。日趨險惡。環顧國際。皆互相觀望。寂然無聲。處此情勢之下。當局而猶不能集舉國之力量。拼死以求生。反藉外交問題爲政爭之工具。置國家危難於不顧是何心理。。吾人誠百思而不得一答</p>
<p>吾人認爲今日國家情勢。己達十分嚴重。千鈞一髮。存亡所繫。國爲全國人民之國。絶不容少數人因循坐誤。尤不容少數人日醉心於權利之爭逐。以速其亡。國人忍死待命。今己至最後之時機。政府如不欲必使國自我亡。種自我滅。則今後亦宜暫泯私慾。勉相團結。移一分爭權利之精神。用之於救亡禦梅。如其不能。則即應舉政權還諸我人民。予人民以救國之機。吾人敢鄭重聲言今後國人再不容以國事爲少數人之專利品矣。從政者應有政治家之人格。長此以國事爲兒戲。不僅無以立國。實且無以自立。凡茲所爲。淸夜自思。應亦不安。奈何猶懵然罔覺耶。</p>

<p>自由談不除庭艸齋夫談薈縣長的資格（下）那末，縣長，就不要資格，不必考試嗎？明日的縣長是要在任上考·政績便是是他的鐵打的資格。每一個現任縣長要交的卷子是·爲本縣人民興了多少利，除了多少弊？分開來說。每一個縣長必須做完下列幾個考顧才算及格··（一）到任後開了幾個學校，加了幾個學生，造就了幾個科學的孩子，科學的靑年，科學的成人？（二）到任後築了幾里公路？（三）到任後栽了幾株樹木？（四）到任後興了幾處水利？（五）到任後提倡了幾種新農工藝生産？（六）到任後組織了幾多人民自衛的武力？（七）到任後除了幾個貪官汚吏土豪劣紳？（八）到任後革了幾種弊政及不良嗜好？（九）到任後培養了多少民衆出來拿民權？（十）到任後减少了不勞而獲與勞而不獲的不平？到了眞正人民出來當國的時候，紙做的文憑是一定混不過去了··只有政績是實在的資格。那時，候補縣長先須跟着一個現任縣長做徒弟，也不能專憑幾篇空文，或幾句空話便讓他出來担任一縣的大政。時事小言  醉痴生現在我國外長一席。要算最難得其人了。像陳友仁先生。登台没有多日。因感於外交棘手。又喊着辭職。繼任者大約是羅文幹先生（見報載）我說顧名思義。羅先生或能稱職。因爲我國政府向抱着不抵抗主義。武幹旣屬不可能。還是文幹的好。但是我方固然彬彬有禮。碰着對方一味蠻幹。横逆之來。眞不知要幹到如何地步呢。報載前外部歐美司長徐謨在勵志社演講。略謂『甲國欲與乙國絶交。必先自量有無實力。若有實力。則儘管絶交。毫無疑義。否則爲自取滅亡之道賢明者不爲也。『云云。這幾句話固然不錯。因爲絶交是第一步。宣戰就是第二步。照我國今日的情形。對於暴日。不要說是宣戰。連絶交都談不到。所以政府對『絶交』一層。巳經是從緩計議了。現在我倒有一比。譬如我有一位朋友。强佔我財産。凌辱我妻女。還不知悛改。用種種野蠻手段。重重壓迫過來。於情於理。對這位黑心朋友。再也不能忍耐。當然可以絶交了。但是因爲自己没有力量。懷着不得巳的苦衷。依然要和他往來。逆來順受。抱着無抵抗主義。含垢忍辱。勉强和這仇人周旋。就是訴之法律公理。也没有效力。你想這是何等痛心的事。也好算是古今中外所罕有的奇談了世界小事記  海客相同的指紋人們的指紋。據說是各各不同。所以全世界的警務富局對於罪犯都須留一指印。以便日後的查考。而重要的契據上。也往往有在簽字之外。加蓋一個指印的但是據英國警務專家的報告曾在三十萬的指印中。發見有兩個指印。寛完全相同大家都以爲怪事一個多才多藝的僕人全世界一個多才多藝而工給最高的僕人。要算美國一位戲院大王的僕人范爾法ＨＦｅｌｐｈａｍ了。他除了日常何應一切。外兼任秘書汽車夫管家和私人的股票代理人。能說四國方言。眞當上多才多藝的評語。　　倫敦的寳物倫敦有一個公家的寳物。歷年很久。而也很爲名貴原質是一塊純潔的水晶。長十八英寸嵌以黄金。每個市長每年必須將這寳物持在手中幾分鐘以爲執有全市政權的表示。。這寳物的年代己不可考。但那鑲工還是盎格魯撤克遜時代的。也可見其古了。酒畔揮毫各有詩  自在國難當前。外宼日深。凡有血氣。莫不憤慨。名畫家張善孖大千昆仲。畫虎山水。各壇其勝。世有定評。善孖昨繪斑豹。奕奕有生氣。將以懸之陶樂春酒家供衆欣賞。届時宴請諸文友。即席揮毫。花卉山水佛像仕女潑墨設色滿目琳啷。玉岑詞人援筆題五古一章於其上。撫時感事。感慨至深詩云。不藏南山霧。。猶飲西江流。所志豈果腹。將湔墜天憂。國難泣神鬼。山林亦同仇。文采不足矜。所貴奮戈矛。萬里逐胡馬。九世崇復讐。中原有志士。激起光神州。龍驤與豹變。髯畫炳千秋。熱血奔騰。使人有執干戈而衛社稷之想。名畫雋句。各有千秋。酒至半巡擊鉢聯句。以助餘慶詩云。海門有客多奇思（指王個竊謝玉岑句）獨上鼎湖求之子。（指陸丹林鄭午昌句）蜀中雙絶藝林豪。（指張善孖大千兄弟）二謝俱能貴洛純。（指謝公展謝玉岑）淵源家學右軍書（指王師子）三絶鄭虔驚再世。（指鄭午昌以上爲章百熙句）賓筵笑樂數平生。歸去章郎寫繭紙。（指章百熙在旅社寫詩陸丹林句）宴罷大千乘酒興正濃。復以速寫筆法。爲個簃繪像。並作佛像數幀。分贈同席者。各皆稱謝而散。醉客捧仙記  荆夢蝶　　錫地向日。雖有書塲多所。而皆爲白髮衰翁。藉遣永日。邇來則風氣一變。入座之客盡屬少年且多靑春婦女。此無他。一女彈詞家之魔力耳。女號醉凝仙。隨其兄醉霓裳。來自吳王台畔。秀髮覆額。丫角雙埀。瓜字年華。柳枝風度。與兄合唱雙珠鳳。分日夜塲。入兩茶樓。城内會芳。城外怡苑。登臺時。斜抱琵琶。輕攏慢撥。鶑囀花外。珠落玉盤。座客莫不色授魂與。歡喜贊歎。髣髴靈山會上。忽逢天女散花。又如李三郎遊月宫。聽仙娥奏霓裳羽衣之曲。一時醉倒旗袍下者（女衣旗袍代石榴裙）何可勝數由是錫報之小錫新無錫之茗邊。無日不見榆揚醉凝仙文字。復取女所題之字。所畫之梅。爲印諸報端以見美人之多才。可謂極捧角之能事矣。以是芳名鵲起。早徧蓉湖惠麓間。憶昔平等閣主都門紀事詩有云「國自興亡誰管得滿城爭說呌天兒」寫都人之譚迷也。今大可改句曰。「國難當前誰管得滿城爭說醉凝仙。」蓋錫人之醉迷不北遊影象及其他（八）  姚蘇鳳　　電影明星胡蝶女士之自述僅有的一次宴會還是在那個工作之餘深居簡出的原則之下，雖然很有許多朋友們招我們宴會，我們總因爲事實上的不可能而婉辭謝絶。但，僅僅有一次，是在梅蘭芳先生的家裏，我們再三的推辭不得而終於赴宴了。那是在一個凉爽的夜裏，一個精緻的中國式的客室中充滿了不平凡的興趣，雖然一共祇有十幾個人，但談話是没有使人感覺得枯澀遇，從上海談到北平，從北平談到世界，從電影談到歌劇，從歌劇談到聲片，没有一句話是不値得聽的，没有一件事是不値得說的我們都很覺得在梅先生的客室裏有着一種藝術的風格，便是梅先生自己也正像這客室中的許多古色古香的陳設樣的恬靜與温文·，梅先生是個很勤懇的人，他没有因爲他成就的偉人而忘記了一個藝人的虚懷若谷的熊度。　　遼東風雲到北平不久，驟然得到了日兵進襲東三省的噩耗北平市中自然也有了異常的震動，我們這一羣因爲工作還没有完畢，在憤慨的情緒中更添了些自己的憂慮。所以我們的工作更緊張了，到此時，各人的歸思才開始梟動，好像忘記了許久的上海也在心頭重新跳躍出，來直到我們工作完畢的時候，我們在報紙上己經得到了便衣隊襲擊天津的不幸的消息，　　别矣來的時候是充滿了喜悅·去的時候雖然還是喜悅，但不免給更大的憤慨與恐怖所掩蓋了。我對於北平。誠然有些留戀這種留戀，好像一個電影迷看一張名作的影片而失望於突然的Ｍｔｅｒｍｉｓｓｉｏｎ或斷片一樣。但是，我們終於上了歸來的車「别矣北平」！减於都人之譚迷。且有似梅毒焉。嗣更變本加厲。凡邑中紳富之家。遇有喜慶等日。相率招醉兄妹堂會。當筵有此。來賓倍多。盡興乃散。客無不醉。非關酒也。前日蔣遇春七十稱觸。客多白首老儒。見女至驚喜。老眼看花。老興勃發。爭爲之揮老筆。唱老調。各成一七絶。次第向主人繳卷。重見科塲風趣焉。老人如此。少年可知己。近以急景凋年兄妹思歸。茶樓己約滿剪書。而無錫大戲院。爲振興營業。堅留兄妹。期以五日。錫人方戀戀於女之去。大有攀轅臥轍之想故院主之有此舉。亦投機事業也。余曩以友人約。亦曾一至會芳樓時老友周子靜　（新無錫報編輯）己先在。含笑相迎。且謂曰。「小家碧玉。能譜新聲。綺席紫雲。足當妙句。吾子不可以無詩。余婉辭以玩籍途窮。司勳夢醒。綺語閑情早成戒律。而周子不可。翌晨報出茗邊載此消息。預爲鼓吹以代擊鉢。遂報之以四絶云。移來桃塢一枝艷。化作蓉湖十里春。惆悵玉簫無主日。年華二五便風塵。埀髫嬌女夜登塲。串珠喉字字香。半面琵琶遮不住。賞音才調有周郎。雲圍月擁見韓娥。無數男兒同眼波。獨有傷心桓子野天涯遲暮怕聞歌。帶病花枝别樣嬌。（呈晚力疾登台）梅魂菊影瘦難描。明知天遣相逢意。强爲詞人破寂寥。短訊全國各地記者公會及各報社。如欲索閱杭州新聞記者公會月刋創刋號一鉅册者。請各　該報一份。（祇要一天）向杭州柴木巷二十二號交換。當即照寄云。戎馬雙樓記（二二）  求幸福齋主人第三回瑜亮同來意使筵席易散尹邢相避不知細盒誰遺那茶房正第二次托着一木盤的碗盞出去。還有一隻脚没邁出房門。就扭回頭來通知道。剛才來電話的李小姐來了。一言未畢。便見那個細長身材女學生裝朿的密斯李側身而進見了安玉田。就氣咻咻的說道。越是心裏急。偏還遇着些加倍急人的事。我與你通過電話後。知道你家裏果出了那種禍事。直恨不得飛了來看你。一坐上車就到不想在百忙中昏暗之下。。誤跳上了一部老頭子所拉的黄包車。走起路來比牛還慢幾次催他拉快一些。情願多加他一點錢。怎奈他年老氣衰。心有餘而力不足縱肯拚命往前　扎。總還是拉不動。快不了。氣起來想往下跳。另換一輛快的車來吧。他又苦苦哀求。說他大半天没拉着座啦。請做做好事。務必成全他　上這一點車錢。買窩窩頭吃。没法子。只好耐性兒聽憑他一步一步慢慢的往前拉。足走了一個鐘頭有零才到此地。玉田你看可氣不可氣安玉田聽得事情就這船奇巧天敎伊誤上了一部老爺車。竟無形中解了他的危難暗中好笑。便忘記了立時回答伊的話李問霞說着說着。忽一眼看見桌上那一席未曾撤盡的殘筵。就又問道。今晚你請誰在屋子裏吃飯。碗盞都未曾收拾完怎麽客人就走了呢。安玉田暗想不好。到底還是手法遲慢。仍留下一點痕迹招了伊來動問。就忸怩着答道。是一位要好的男同學。他見我心中煩悶。特呌了點酒菜來。與我開懷暢叙。飯後。又還要拉我去看電影。我因爲你要來。謝絶了不肯去。而電影院開演的鐘點巳到。所以他怱怱的就先走了這一個謊。倒扯得很圓李問霞眞半點不曾介意就與安玉田同坐在書桌邊且先忙着問起他家中的事故來。安玉田還是感傷己極。照着己先答復梁笑雲的那樣回答。李問霞聽他說得如此悽慘。并還欷歔嗚咽很陪他滴下了些熱情的眼淚。後來談到將來的打算。以及往後的困難。伊自也和梁笑雲一樣。力勸他節哀自重。努力奮鬥。戰勝這個艱難的環境。另造一個燦爛光明的新生命。不過伊對於安玉田的關心。似乎比梁笑雲還要深切。也没有梁笑雲那般泰然的氣度只深鎖愁眉的繫念着道。說來也難怪你佷灼急。便是我也異樣在躭憂你我現今都還在學生時代。尚没有自立的能力。一向全是靠着家庭的培植與接濟。</p>

<p>Yan Huiqing Hints at Necessity of Adopting Other Articles of the Covenant; League of Nations Asks Chinese and Japanese Governments to Eliminate Major Incidents in Shanghai</p>
<p>League of Nations Administrative Council</p>
<h3 id="e2">Atmosphere Throughout is Grave <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) When the League of Nations Administrative Council convened today to discuss the Manchurian situation, the atmosphere throughout was extremely grave. Attendees and observers alike understood the seriousness of the current problem. The meeting lasted from 5:45 PM to 8:00 PM, a total of more than two hours. Everyone present spent the entire time listening attentively to the presentation of Dr. Yan Huiqing, the Chinese representative, and the response of Mr. Satō, the Japanese representative. Dr. Yan is the Chinese Minister to the United States, currently serving as the chief Chinese representative. Mr. Satō is the Japanese Ambassador to Belgium, holding a position comparable to that of Yoshizawa. Dr. Yan stated that the facts regarding the Manchurian case were clear from the beginning. China had to choose between preparedness and reliance on the treaty and the League of Nations. China is not a military power, so it appealed to the League of Nations. He now asks the Administrative Council to consider and acknowledge China's rights. China understands the suitability of seeking a resolution under Article 11 of the Covenant, but the need to further adopt the various rights and remedies available under other articles of the Covenant is now becoming increasingly urgent, he said.</p>
<p>As the Administrative Council meeting was concluding, the French representative, Mr. Paul-Boncour, acting as chairman, declared that the League of Nations now asks the Chinese and Japanese governments to do their utmost to prevent the occurrence of new major incidents in Shanghai. Shanghai has international and French concessions, and the situation is extremely complex, he said. The League of Nations believes that the situation is already very entangled, and recent events in Shanghai have only exacerbated it. However, until the details of this matter are formally brought to the attention of the Administrative Council, there may not be any surprising developments.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Yan Huiqing Delivers a Moving Speech <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, the Administrative Council decided to temporarily postpone consideration of the report on slavery in Liberia, so that all members could focus on the Manchurian problem. Then, Dr. Yan was invited to speak. He spoke fluently, saying that what ordinary observers might view as a local incident occurring in an area far from the major centers of Europe and America has, in just four months, become a problem that poses an extreme danger to world peace. It is clear to everyone that the Manchurian Incident of September 18 was merely the initial step in a program of aggression against the territorial integrity of another country that one country brazenly implemented according to its predetermined plan. Japan has occupied 200,000 square miles of Chinese territory with a population of 20 million people using military force. This fact has been beyond doubt from the beginning. The Administrative Council, with patience and sincerity, spent six weeks, holding twenty meetings, and made conscientious efforts to resolve this dispute. It unanimously passed two resolutions, both based on the solemn promise of the Japanese to withdraw their troops as quickly as possible. However, this promise has been completely broken. Not only have troops not been gradually withdrawn, but they have gradually been increased. Since the Administrative Council meeting six weeks ago, the aggression has continued unabated. As the U.S. Secretary of State has said, the last vestiges of the Chinese government's authority in southern Manchuria have been destroyed. Jinzhou and the land south of it, such as Shanhaiguan, are now following in the footsteps of Shenyang, Changchun, Andong, Jilin, Qiqihar, etc. Japan is now also invading Rehe Province and endangering key areas in northern, central, and southern China. Its recent threats include the occupation of Fuzhou and Shanghai. The recent continuous developments and Japan's open statements regarding its aggressive policy, intending to force China to accept its annexation of Manchuria, and intending to threaten the central and local authorities of China to suppress all expressions of emotion among the Chinese people aroused by Japan's unbearable and tyrannical attacks, have shattered all hopes that the world held that the situation would not become increasingly serious. Since December 1, the situation has deteriorated daily, and the resolutions of the Administrative Council have been deliberately resisted by Japan. The Chinese government cannot but express its deepest disappointment that the League of Nations investigation team will not be able to reach Manchuria until at least April, because its departure is so late, and the investigation team has also announced that it does not wish to take the fastest route to the invaded and ravaged land. The reasons Japan has given for occupying Manchuria have often changed. First, it was said that the railway was attacked, then it was self-defense, then it was the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents, and finally it was bandits. In reality, these are all pretexts used by the Japanese. Japan wants to stop the boycott of goods, but there is no government in the world that can force its people to buy what they do not want to buy. The anger of the Chinese people is extreme and cannot be described in words, yet there is no rioting within the country. This should be considered remarkable. Japan insists on the Open Door policy in Manchuria, but this door is filled with Japanese who are rushing to be the first to pass through, and others cannot pass through it, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Response of Japanese Representative Satō <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The response of Japanese Representative Satō was quite lengthy. He first described the current status of Manchuria and Shanghai, then said that the occupation of Jinzhou was a temporary matter. Japan will maintain the Open Door policy. Japan has no territorial ambitions, but is determined to make Manchuria a place where Chinese, Japanese, and other nationals can jointly pursue development in peace and security. He regretted that this issue was raised as the disarmament conference was about to open. He called Dr. Yan's claim that Japan was occupying 200,000 square miles of Manchuria with a mere 25,000 troops "fantastic." It should be known that Manchuria is still Manchuria, the Chinese people are still there, and many cities still have Chinese officials, but the Chinese administrative machinery has suffered a setback. Satō then elaborated on the situation in Jinzhou and the position of the Japanese troops, saying that it was regrettable that the first proposal made by Gu Weijun, the former Chinese Foreign Minister, that Chinese troops could withdraw into Shanhaiguan, was not implemented. Japanese troops had already withdrawn into the railway area, but were constantly attacked by informal and formal troops, as well as police volunteers and bandits. The Japanese commander had only one course of action. The occupation of Jinzhou was a natural and unavoidable result of Zhang Xueliang's provocative aggression. The Japanese troops were welcomed by the residents of Jinzhou. Although the police had temporarily been disarmed, they have now been rearmed, and the police are now responsible for maintaining public order. Japanese soldiers are only stationed at the city gates and stations, he said. Satō then elaborated on the spread of banditry in Manchuria, saying that since the Japanese army has already started suppressing bandits, it cannot stop halfway. Satō acknowledged that the situation in Shanghai was very tense, but said that the systematic incitement of the masses by the Chinese authorities was the root of the chaos. What enraged the Japanese to a dangerous degree was the headline in a certain Chinese-language newspaper in Shanghai reporting the bombing attempt on the Japanese Emperor, which unfortunately struck a secondary vehicle. The consequences of the Chinese authorities promoting anti-foreignism will be unfortunate. The Japanese have shown great patience, but this policy only encourages future Chinese aggression. Japan is determined to protect its people from harassment. The great powers have all sent warships and troops to China to protect their people. Japan is now being criticized, accused of wanting to occupy Manchuria and close the Open Door, but these accusations are completely untrue. Japan actually wants to maintain the Open Door policy and make Manchuria a place where Chinese, Japanese, and other nationals can seek progress and development in peace and security. Japan has exchanged views frankly with China in the hope of resolving various outstanding issues, but China has refused and has instead instigated a violent mass movement, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Administrative Council Does Not Change Stance <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting, when a member was asked what action the Administrative Council would take, the member replied that the attitude of the League of Nations would naturally be influenced by the position taken by the Chinese representative, but the League of Nations investigation team is now about to depart for on-the-spot investigation, so the Administrative Council may not need to change its stance before the investigation team's report arrives.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council's public meeting this morning did not discuss the Manchurian problem, but after the agenda for the afternoon was completed, the members held a private meeting (without the attendance of the Chinese and Japanese representatives) that lasted for two hours. No communiqué was issued after the meeting. It is said that another meeting is planned for 10:30 AM tomorrow, where the Manchurian situation will likely be discussed. However, it was soon announced that the members of the Administrative Council held a private meeting this afternoon and decided to give mild advice to the representatives of China and Japan. The two countries' representatives were invited to meet with Mr. Paul-Boncour, the French representative and chairman of the Administrative Council, tonight. It is now hoped that the entire Manchurian problem will be temporarily shelved, pending the League of Nations investigation team's trip to the Far East to investigate everything, report to the League of Nations, and then be discussed again to seek a solution. (Reuter's Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, the League of Nations Council held a secret meeting to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute. Representatives from China and Japan were not present. The members seemed to favor an opinion that the Council should include all events that occurred before December 10 of last year within the resolutions agreed upon by the parties concerned during the meeting in Paris, without further retracing them. It is generally believed that the Council is currently most concerned about the events relating to the fate of Shanghai. Representatives from both China and Japan believe that the situation in Shanghai could become critical at any time. From today onwards, the Committee of Twelve will focus all its attention on this point. The wish of the Council, its Chairman, and the Secretariat of the League of Nations is to find ways to prevent the threat to Shanghai from becoming more serious. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Before the opening of the League of Nations Council, it first held a secret meeting as usual to formally pass the agenda of this session. Due to the increasingly serious developments in the Sino-Japanese dispute in Shanghai, public opinion is that the investigation team may take the Trans-Siberian Railway to the Far East early.

<p>(London) The British National Peace Council telegraphed Foreign Secretary Simon, hoping that the British representative attending the League of Nations meeting in Geneva would fully support the principles of the American note to Japan, and hoping that the British representative would not make statements that could lead people to suspect that the British government recognizes the de facto occupation of Manchuria by Japanese troops. It also stated that for the sake of the nation and the international community, it is urgently necessary to make it clear to strong and weak countries alike that territorial and political changes should not be achieved by force.

The Japanese army restored communication between Jinzhou and Suizhong, and increased its troop strength along the stations to prevent attacks. On the 25th morning, Brigade Commander Yoda used one armored vehicle and one troop train as an advance guard to inspect the situation along the line from Jinzhou to Suizhong. On the 25th, the righteous army launched another offensive towards Jinxi. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The righteous army on the Yingkou-Goubangzi line is fighting with the Domon unit south of Panshan. More than 1,000 righteous army members from Beizhen raided the Kamimura unit. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army plans to eliminate the teams in the area from Hezhong to Xingcheng and has decided to occupy the railway from Suizhong to Yuguan. It plans to transfer a large number of troops, with a tendency to advance westward. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese army is still advancing towards Rehe, but encountering slight resistance. According to official reports, those who are blocking the Chinese troops have suffered heavy casualties. On Sunday, Japanese troops advancing towards Rehe northwest of Dahushan engaged with the Chinese. Three Japanese soldiers were killed and five were injured. It is reported that 200 Chinese people were killed, mostly by bombs from airplanes. (Reuter's Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) More than 10,000 members of the righteous army are concentrated north of Goubangzi and Dahushan, engaging in guerrilla warfare for days. The Japanese army in that area consists of three brigades attached to an air wing and plans a general mobilization. Most of the Japanese troops in Jinxi have been urgently transferred to provide assistance. With the troop strength in Jinxi being weak, the righteous army launched a three-pronged counter-offensive towards Jinxi, taking advantage of the weakness. The county seat may be captured any day now. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There are still small groups of Japanese troops between Xingcheng and Suizhong, attacking the railway line every night. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, Japanese troops discovered a large group of righteous army members more than ten li east of Suizhong. The Japanese troops in Suizhong fired more than ten cannons eastward as a warning. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>After Sun Ke's Resignation</p>

<p>The Government Has Not Given Up Trying to Retain Him</p>
<p>Someone Proposes Inviting Wang to Succeed Him</p>
<p>Guangdong Executive Committee Holds Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 5:00 PM on the 26th, Wu Tiecheng made a long-distance call from Shanghai to Chen Mingshu, saying that Sun Ke intended to invite Chen to Shanghai on the night train today for consultations. Chen said that the time for the call was pressing and he could not give a concrete reply immediately, asking Wu to tell Sun that he would consider it. Chen immediately rushed to visit various important figures to discuss his course of action. He telegraphed Sun at 6:00 PM, saying, "If you return to office, brother, I will come to Shanghai. If you are unwilling to share the heavy burden, brother, I cannot leave Nanjing due to my heavy political affairs," and so on. It has been heard that Ju Zheng, who went to Shanghai to persuade Sun, will return to Nanjing tonight and will give a detailed report on whether Sun can withdraw his resignation. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain committee member said that the government has not yet given up trying to retain Sun Ke as President of the Executive Yuan today, but Sun has not yet agreed to come to Nanjing to reply. As for the reasons for Sun's resignation, they are entirely due to the lack of solutions to diplomatic and financial problems, and not due to disagreements with any important figures. It has been proposed here that if Sun does not return for the time being, Wang should be invited to serve as President of the Executive Yuan. As for Song Ziwen, given his familiarity with finance, it would be appropriate for him to continue as Minister of Finance, which is slightly different from the news in Shanghai that Song would be President of the Executive Yuan and Ye Zhuotang would be Minister of Finance. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 25th decided to send a telegram of condolence to Sun Ke regarding his resignation as President of the Executive Yuan and to recommend Zhang Ji and Ju Zheng to persuade him to stay. The rumors about Wang succeeding him were not discussed. Even if there were such rumors, Wang would be unwilling to take the position. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hui Zhongwu returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 26th and said that after going to Shanghai, he did not meet Sun because Sun was in the hospital. He personally handed Wang's handwritten letter to Sun's wife. Sun was passively leaving Nanjing because diplomacy was difficult, but the Central Government and Wang and Chiang all hoped that Sun would return to Nanjing to jointly face the national crisis. The Central Government recommended Zhang Ji and Ju Zheng to go to Shanghai on the 25th to persuade him to stay, and he should be able to return to Nanjing to take responsibility. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangdong officials paid close attention to the news of Sun's resignation on the evening of the 25th.

On the same day, they held a joint emergency meeting of the Executive Committee and the Political Affairs Committee to discuss measures. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hu Hanmin expressed his regret over Sun's resignation, saying that Sun was the President of the Executive Yuan, which was no different from a responsible cabinet, and there should be an opportunity to test his policies.

<h3 id="e17">Rumored Diplomatic Steps Towards Japan <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>If the Current League of Nations Meeting Fails</p>
<p>Direct Negotiations Will Be Conducted with Japan</p>
<p>To Be Submitted to Public Decision at the National Crisis Conference</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It has been learned from a certain news agency that the central government's policy towards Japan has been discussed at talks in recent days, and the steps have gradually become consistent. It is believed that since the League of Nations can hardly achieve the goal of relying on a strong power in fact, to break the current stalemate, it is necessary to open up a new path. It is heard that the steps will be to first observe whether there are appropriate methods at the current League of Nations meeting, as the last guarantee of the covenant. Otherwise, our country intends to ask the Japanese side to first stop all military actions in the eastern provinces, and then the Japanese government will automatically withdraw the so-called five principles from the League of Nations. At the same time, all the military forces in the eastern provinces will be withdrawn, and the equivalent authority of the Chinese government will be restored. Under the monitoring of neutral countries of the League of Nations, in a state of security and absolute non-military control, direct negotiations will be conducted on the reasons for Japan's invasion of Chinese territory, seeking a just resolution. Regarding this issue, although the government adheres to the principle of not losing power and land, it is still afraid that the people will misunderstand the direct negotiations as a surrender under duress. It will first present the unavoidable difficulties at the National Crisis Conference and request a public decision, so that the government can have the basis to rely on. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) There are three paths for the policy towards Japan: (1) Relying on the League of Nations, (2) Severing diplomatic relations, (3) Opening up a new path. A concrete decision will be made at the Central Political Council meeting on the 27th. Whether the League of Nations can be relied upon depends entirely on whether the current Executive Council meeting can find a new path for mediation within two weeks, which will be the ultimate test of whether the League of Nations can uphold the covenant. As for the effect of the Liaoning case investigation team, it is feared that it will be difficult to meet our expectations, because the investigation time for the team is scheduled for after August or September, which can only be completed. Seeking slow medical treatment for a sudden illness is of no help. Moreover, the scope of the investigation is not limited to the facts of the Liaoning case, but includes all issues between China and Japan, which will inevitably lead to extraneous issues and make the Northeast problem feel like a long night with many dreams. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The foreign policy towards Japan has been drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Central Committee members have exchanged opinions on it in recent days, which have been largely concentrated. The discussion will be submitted to the Central Political Council meeting on the 27th. Chen Mingshu has specially sent a letter to Gan Jiehou, asking him to attend the meeting to report on the recent negotiation situation and the steps to be taken. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to those familiar with international politics, although the League of Nations has now reopened and is discussing the Sino-Japanese issue, if the League of Nations wants to maintain its own prestige and stop the Japanese military actions, it must find a new path within a short period of time and resolutely resolve the Sino-Japanese incident. If it still uses the old methods of the past or handles it according to the final report of the international investigation team, it can be asserted that there will be no satisfactory result. Therefore, the mission of this international investigation team is feared not to meet our country's hopes. In terms of time, the team will not be able to arrive in China until early March, in which case the Japanese side will be able to prolong its military actions, and the Sino-Japanese incident will not be resolved quickly. Furthermore, in terms of the scope of the team's responsibility, it should conduct a detailed investigation of the facts after September 18 of last year, but the team has expanded its scope of responsibility to include all issues between China and Japan, which is inevitably beyond its authority and loses the original intention of the investigation. Moreover, the nature of the team is very different from that of an international conference, because the team's responsibility is like that of a judge in a court, who can only investigate the actual circumstances of facts, law, economics, and society as much as possible and make an accurate report for the League of Nations' reference.

<h3 id="e18">On the Character of Politicians <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Amidst the clamorous calls and urgent requests, Jiang and Wang, after their meeting in Hangzhou, entered Beijing together. The central government began to show some vitality, and the political situation began to show some signs of change. However, just as Jiang and Wang arrived, Premier Sun Ke suddenly resigned. The bizarre changes and twists of the political situation truly leave people unable to comprehend or grasp.</p>
<p>Tracing back to the split between Ningbo and Yue last year, the disturbances and disputes, and the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, the stimuli from foreign aggression, and the envoys of peace, were constantly on the road, negotiating painstakingly. The Yue faction insisted on Jiang's resignation as a prerequisite. It was as if "If this person does not leave, the disaster will not end." Finally, Mr. Jiang retired, and the political situation took a sharp turn for the worse. A new government was born with difficulty, but the key figures of the party and the state were all ill for a time. Hu was ill in Yue, Wang was ill in Shanghai, and Jiang was leisurely enjoying himself on Miaogao Terrace, enjoying his solitude. The central government was empty, and there was no one in charge. Everything was scattered like sand, and nothing could be done. Therefore, the call to urge the three leaders to enter Beijing arose in response to the times. The envoys urging them to come were constantly on the road. Even Mr. Sun himself went to Hangzhou to urge Jiang to enter Beijing. At that time, the situation was as if "If this person does not come out, what will happen to the people?" Now Wang and Jiang have already entered Beijing and are already in power. However, Mr. Sun, as the Premier of the responsible cabinet, suddenly came to Shanghai in a hurry and resigned in a hurry. What followed was the retention and urging. In the past month, the diplomatic situation has become increasingly urgent, while the government authorities are busy avoiding responsibility and urging each other to take office. Sometimes they object, sometimes they welcome, sometimes they are active, sometimes they are discouraged. With joys and sorrows, separations and reunions, and all kinds of changes, we truly do not know whether the government authorities are playing a game of hide-and-seek, or suffering from the capricious disease of children, or whether the government authorities are all drunkards, so that they help each other to the east, but then they fall to the west. In this situation, we truly cannot distinguish right from wrong, and we cannot laugh or cry. Since the September 18th Incident, the leaders of the party and the state have been proclaiming to the people every day that they will seek peace, unity, and sincere solidarity to overcome national difficulties together. However, in reality, they come and go, each with their own hidden agendas, as incompatible as ice and coal. Now the diplomatic situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. Looking around the world, everyone is watching each other, silent. In this situation, if the authorities still cannot gather the strength of the whole country and risk their lives to seek survival, but instead use diplomatic issues as a tool for political struggle and disregard the national crisis, what is their mentality? We truly cannot find an answer even after thinking about it a hundred times.</p>
<p>We believe that the national situation today has reached an extremely serious level, on the verge of collapse, with survival at stake. The country belongs to all the people of the country, and it is absolutely not allowed for a small number of people to sit idly by and make mistakes. It is especially not allowed for a small number of people to be obsessed with the pursuit of power and accelerate its demise. The people of the country are enduring death and waiting for orders. Now is the final moment. If the government does not want to inevitably cause the country to perish and the race to be destroyed, then it should temporarily abandon selfish desires and strive for unity, and shift the spirit of vying for power to saving the country and resisting foreign aggression. If it cannot, then it should return the political power to our people, giving the people the opportunity to save the country. We dare to solemnly declare that from now on, the people of the country will no longer allow national affairs to be the exclusive property of a small number of people. Politicians should have the character of statesmen. If they continue to treat national affairs as a child's play, they will not only be unable to establish a country, but also unable to establish themselves. All these actions, if thought about in the quiet of the night, should also be disturbing. Why are they still ignorant and unaware?</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Youren has resigned, and Luo Wen'gan is still declining. At today's Executive Yuan meeting, someone proposed that Vice President Chen Mingshu concurrently serve as the acting minister, but Chen repeatedly and firmly declined, requesting that the head of the Foreign Ministry, Gan Jiehou, act as the minister to maintain the status quo.

<p>(Nanjing) For this League of Nations Executive Council meeting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Yan Huiqing, China's chief representative, to take note. Mr. Yan believes that the scope of the instructions given by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is insufficient for use, and the situation has changed after the resignation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He telegraphed Beijing to request a second set of instructions to prepare for the discussion. It is heard that the ministry has already drafted the second set of instructions, but because no one signed it, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan today for submission to the Central Political Council for review. After the Central Political Council approves it at today's meeting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will telegraph it to Representative Yan. (Special Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to information from a certain consulate, Yan Huiqing declared that he had proposed suspending Articles 15 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, hoping that the Japanese representative would also abandon the five principles, so that China and Japan could start negotiations immediately and be willing to seek a fair solution under the clear supervision of the League of Nations.

<p>(Nanjing) Tao Ye Gong, who has been appointed as a member of the National Crisis Conference, intends to submit a proposal for the implementation of conscription.

<p>Japanese Acting Envoy Yano Meets with Zhang Xueliang</p>
<p>Demanding the Closure of the Peking Leader Newspaper</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Public Security Bureau notified various newspapers today, stating that the Peking Morning Post had previously been suspended for one day because it contained information involving the Japanese Imperial Family. Now, the Peking Leader newspaper has also published the same information. Negotiations are currently underway. As the diplomatic situation is tense, all matters relating to the Japanese Imperial Family and the Japanese military must be reported with caution in the future, and nothing should be given to the enemy to exploit. (Special Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Reuters learned today that Japanese Acting Envoy Yano met with Zhang Xueliang on Saturday and Sunday, stating that the English-language Peking Leader's editorial on Korean affairs insulted Japan and demanded the permanent closure of the newspaper, the arrest of the author of the article, Mr. Li, and an apology to Japan. Mediation on this matter has been ineffective for days. Yano stated that this matter is in the hands of the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo, and he is now acting in accordance with instructions. According to the latest reports, the Peking Leader is the only English-language daily newspaper in Peiping in the past two years. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy stated this afternoon that the Peking Leader has been criticizing Japan in recent months, and the Japanese have been patiently enduring it. The cause of this incident was the Morning Post's earlier publication of a declaration from the Korean Independence Federation, which contained many insulting remarks against Japan. After negotiations with the Chinese authorities, a satisfactory outcome was obtained. Unexpectedly, the next day, the Leader translated and published the declaration, and although disrespectful words were deleted, the Japanese still regarded it as an insult. The next day, the newspaper published an editorial on Korean affairs, so the Japanese party requested Zhang Xueliang to deal with it in a severe manner. It is heard that the reporter of the newspaper, Mr. Li, is now willing to leave Peiping temporarily, hoping that the matter can be resolved. According to semi-official sources, Zhang Xueliang has not yet acknowledged the Japanese demands. (Reuters Dispatch of the 26th)</p>

<p>National News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: According to the Foreign Ministry today, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa will send a practical instruction regarding the Shanghai incident to Murai, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai. It is reported that the Japanese authorities, due to Shanghai Mayor Wu's failure to reply to Murai, have decided to protect Japanese residents in Shanghai with strict and effective plans. It is also reported that after receiving the instruction, Murai will consult with Rear Admiral Shiozawa and others to deal with the anti-Japanese national salvation associations with emergency measures. Furthermore, Tokyo naval authorities have also decided that if the Chinese authorities do not provide a satisfactory answer to Japan's demands, they will take action against anti-Japanese elements in Shanghai. Therefore, the Shanghai situation may undergo drastic changes in the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu denied that he will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow and that the final solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute will be determined after his arrival in Shanghai. Shigemitsu is scheduled to depart on the Nagasaki Maru on Thursday, and his arrival in Shanghai will be on Sunday. The Shanghai negotiation is still being handled by Japanese Consul General Murai, acting on instructions from the Japanese Foreign Ministry, in conjunction with Rear Admiral Shiozawa, commander of the Japanese fleet. Shiozawa is constantly communicating with the Tokyo Naval Ministry. The Cabinet again discussed the Shanghai incident yesterday. Because Naval Minister Osumi is ill in bed, the Vice Minister reported on the situation in Shanghai. It is reported that the Cabinet resolved to exert its determination to protect Japanese residents in Shanghai.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 26th: The Cabinet met at 11:00 AM today. Naval Minister Osumi explained the situation in Shanghai in detail. As a result of the exchange of opinions, it was unanimously agreed that if decisive measures are not taken at this time, it will be difficult to ensure the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents. Therefore, it was decided to make every effort to advance according to the established policy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: Responsible sources today stated that Japan is determined to resolve China's organized anti-Japanese movement. Authorities commented on the Shanghai situation, saying that Japan's actions depend entirely on China's actions, but will not disturb the Public Concession. Although the government acknowledges the seriousness of the overall situation, it still hopes that the incident will not escalate, as the new Nanjing government is now adopting a rational attitude towards Japan and is apparently prepared to curb the illegal activities of anti-Japanese groups.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Nagasaki, 26th: Sasebo has already dispatched three military aircraft, transported to Shanghai by the Shanghai Maru for the use of the Marines, which can arrive tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: Several warships were ordered to sail to China today, presumably to Shanghai, but details are kept secret. It is believed that there are a cruiser and twelve destroyers, which have been preparing for departure in Sasebo since Friday.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Nagasaki, 26th: Kiyomizu Keishu, the chief priest of Myohoji Temple in Kobe, departed from Nagasaki for Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru today. Kiyomizu and the late Amazaki Keisho, who was killed in Shanghai, were teacher and brother. According to Kiyomizu, he and Keisho went to India with Nissho last year, and later struggled for the sect in China. Unexpectedly, Keisho sacrificed himself this time. After I arrive in Shanghai, I will consult with the military and will not return without avenging Keisho's death.</p>

<p>Intend to Lodge a Serious Protest with Japan</p>
<p>U.S. Consul General Ordered to Act at His Discretion</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 25th: Although the State Department has not issued any statement regarding the tense situation in Shanghai, government officials have expressed that they are very concerned about any independent actions by Japanese troops in the Shanghai Public Concession. U.S. Consul General in Shanghai Cunningham is in close contact with the State Department. It is reported that the State Department has given Cunningham the authority to act at his discretion and has also given this authority to Admiral Tana, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, who can move his ships at will without first consulting the Navy Department.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 26th: The New York Times this morning published a special dispatch from Washington, stating that Washington has the impression that the United States is considering taking forceful action, either jointly with Britain or independently, regarding the landing of Japanese Marines in Shanghai. The New York Tribune's Washington special dispatch stated that there are various signs that the United States will lodge a forceful protest against Japanese actions in the Public Concession. A government spokesman has subtly warned that the actions of the Japanese in the Concession will be indefensible and unforgivable.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: The Liberal Party's news bulletin commented on the possibility of Japanese troops occupying Shanghai, saying that Japan is using the excuse that the Chinese government cannot maintain law and order, but the dominance of the Japanese military authorities over their own government is becoming increasingly tight and may lead to surprising results that are difficult to limit. The extreme intimidation plan damages the dignity of the Chinese government and only worsens the situation.</p>

<p>National News Agency, London, 26th: British experts today claimed that the upcoming Disarmament Conference may discuss the abolition of aircraft carriers because of their exorbitant cost. The United States had long considered it too expensive, as the two warships of this type built by the United States cost 100 million US dollars. Moreover, since aircraft can now take off and land from battleships, submarines, etc., aircraft carriers are now considered redundant. Currently, Britain, the United States, and Japan each have two of these ships, while France and Italy each have one.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Cheng Yun Talks About Bin County Provincial Government Situation <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Dissolution of the Provincial Government Requires a Central Government Order</p>
<p>I am Not Afraid of Airplanes and Artillery Even if it Costs Me My Life</p>
<p>A correspondent from Harbin visited Cheng Yun, Chairman of the Jilin Provisional Provincial Government in Bin County, and had the following conversation: (Q) Chairman, you have taken on a difficult task this time in organizing the provincial government. Can you tell us the story of the provincial government moving to Bin County? (A) After the Japanese army invaded Liaoning and Jilin, when the provincial government held a committee meeting, I strongly advocated resistance. Unfortunately, we lacked the strength to do so. After the Japanese army entered the city, they forced me to serve as the president of the High Court. I did not want to be a puppet official under Japanese rule, so I disguised myself and escaped. Because the cost of living in Beiping was low, I initially planned to move to Beiping and live a civilian life. When the train arrived in Jinzhou, I received a telegram from Beiping ordering me to return to Harbin to organize the government. Considering the importance of the matter, I detoured through the Taoang Railway to Harbin. Because of various inconveniences in Harbin, I submitted a report to the National Government, which approved the relocation of the Jilin Provincial Government to Bin County. (Q) Have there been any difficulties since the establishment of the provincial government? (A) There is nothing easy in China now. If we are afraid of difficulties, there is nothing we can do. There were no major difficulties in organizing the provincial government this time. In fact, even if there were difficulties, as a modern Chinese, we should not talk about difficulties. (Q) How many provincial committee members are currently in Bin County? (A) Myself, Director Xu of the Finance Department, and Secretary-General 　 are the three. (Q) Why haven't the other provincial committee members come? (A) Rong Hou and Zhang Qihuai, two provincial committee members, could not come due to illness. Wang Zhiyou and Zhong Yu, two provincial committee members, were too busy with official duties in Harbin and could not come either. (Q) Who is responsible for the military of each brigade under the jurisdiction of the provincial government? (A) Li Ziluo, the Training Supervisor and current Deputy Commander, is fully responsible for military affairs. However, the provincial government is responsible for raising military pay. (Q) Is it true that there are rumors that Wang Zhiyou and others have an unclear attitude? (A) Wang and others are all my old friends of many years, and their character is very noble. There is absolutely no possibility of an unclear attitude. (Q) What is the chairman's opinion on the Jilin side requesting the dissolution of the provincial government? (A) I have no preconceived notions about the existence or non-existence of the provincial government. However, I came here to organize the provincial government under the explicit order of the Central Government and the entrustment of Deputy Commander (Zhang Zuoxiang). Now I can only obey the instructions of the Central Government and the Deputy Commander. As for myself, I have no preconceived notions. (Q) If the Bin Provincial Government is not abolished, the people will inevitably suffer. (A) The people will inevitably suffer. However, if the situation deteriorates, I am afraid the Chinese people will have no happiness to speak of. (Q) It is heard that after the provincial government was bombed, many personnel scattered, and it is also heard that the provincial government plans to move to Yilan. Is this true? (A) The personnel who have come here to work are mostly patriots who are not afraid of difficulties, and their numbers are increasing day by day, which shows that the hearts of the people have not yet died. As for the claim of moving to Yilan, the provincial government has absolutely no intention of doing so. (Q) Were you frightened by the Japanese planes dropping bombs? (A) I came here to take risks and have already put life and death out of my mind. I have nothing else, and I am not afraid of artillery and airplanes at all. (Q) What is the situation of the war in the front lines of Wuchang and Yushu? (A) This time, the infighting among compatriots is the most shameful thing. However, because Yu Xizhou led his troops to force an invasion, we had no choice but to send Commander Feng to Wuchang and other places for self-defense, not to seek war. (Q) What is the attitude of the original Jilin brigades? (A) The brigade commanders of Jilin are all old comrades of the Deputy Commander for many years and are extremely reliable. Their attitude can be seen from the troop movements this time. Other matters are related to military secrets, so it is not convenient to disclose them. Finally, Cheng said that he came here purely to maintain national sovereignty and uphold the rule of law and would never yield until death. Please do not lightly believe various anti-propaganda from the outside world. We also hope that the public opinion circle will uphold justice and promote integrity, so that the hearts of the people will not die and the national destiny can be extended. (January 18)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Zhang Zuoxiang Resigns and Comes to Tianjin <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>A Tianjin correspondent reports that Jilin Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Zuoxiang, feeling ashamed and pained by the loss of the Northeast, recently wrote to Zhang Xueliang, earnestly requesting him to forward his resignation from all concurrent positions to the Central Government and to punish him for losing national territory. Zhang Xueliang telegraphed the Central Government. It is unknown whether his request will be approved, but his determination to leave is very firm. Therefore, he resolutely left Beiping with his family last night and came to Tianjin. His adjutant Song Changyan accompanied him. Other subordinates all came to notify the train, which arrived at the Tianjin station at 12:00 midnight. Other than Qian Mingyu, his Tianjin advisor, who came to the station to take care of him, no one else came to greet him, probably because the local authorities were unaware of his arrival.</p>
<p>According to Zhang, he told the reporter that the Shenyang Incident cut off his return route. For several months, he has relied entirely on telegrams to maintain the morale of the Jilin defense, with two or thirty telegrams a day covering a distance of more than two thousand miles. His 25th Brigade, the core of the Jilin army, stationed in Yushu, was most feared by the Japanese army. Yushu had 8,000 militiamen who were willing to assist the 25th Brigade in resisting the enemy. Initially, because the overall plan was undecided and it was difficult to advance or retreat, they did not dare to act rashly. Until January 9th, Xi Qia, willing to be a slave, under the cover of more than ten Japanese planes, led his bandit army of about three brigades and a mixed Japanese army of about one brigade to attack Yushu fiercely. Our 25th Brigade and 8,000 militiamen joined together to meet them. They fought bloodily day and night, killing countless enemies. However, man has his limits. We had no reinforcements. Each soldier had only 200 rounds of ammunition, and the equipment was faulty. It was obvious that the final victory would belong to the elite enemy, even a three-year-old child could know this. As expected, by January 18, the defeat of our army was complete. However, if it were not for the treachery of the militiamen, the entire army would not have been annihilated. Now Xi Qia's bandit soldiers have mixed with the militiamen. I could have mobilized the army of the Chinese Eastern Railway under my command to fight these people to the death, but I fear that the result would be the same whether we fight or not, and fighting would only increase the devastation of the region and the burden on our homeland. I also fear that it would trigger Sino-Russian negotiations, so I am willing to endure humiliation and pain and await the Central Government's decision on the overall plan before determining the next steps. However, I can endure, but the people of the Northeast can no longer endure. For the past ten days, people's organizations as far as two thousand miles away have sent telegrams questioning the plan. I have to ask Zhang, and Zhang has to obey the Central Government. Since the Shenyang Incident, the Central Government has still had no practical plan, going back and forth without being able to do anything. I have failed to defend the territory and deserve to be punished. Continuing like this will only increase my sins. Therefore, I have decided to resign and request punishment. Once a plan for recovery is in place, I will go east with a guilty body to kill the enemy and hopefully atone for my past mistakes. (January 24)</p>

<h3 id="e86">Financial Difficulties of Anhui's Education Funding. Anhui Province's education funding relies on a monthly central government subsidy of 100,000 yuan, which is almost entirely depended upon for the regular expenses of schools throughout the province. After the start of the second half of last year, the Finance Department only disbursed two and a half months' worth of subsidies, covering August, September, and half of October. As of the end of December, the Finance Department owed a total of 250,000 yuan, plus the previous debt of 195,000 yuan, totaling 445,000 yuan. The Anhui Education Department has tried its best to maintain operations, but the provincial treasury is also strained due to the impact of floods. It managed to scrape together enough to pay about two months and 80% of the regular expenses for various schools in the second half of last year, which was already extremely difficult and involved a great deal of effort. Although the schools are currently on break, they are unable to close accounts properly. Salaries and office expenses are almost three months in arrears. The need for funds is urgent. The provincial government has repeatedly telegraphed the Finance Department on the 7th and 11th of this month, urging the allocation of funds, stating that the salaries of teachers and staff in Anhui's schools are several months in arrears, making it impossible to close out the semester. The next semester is about to begin, and it will be difficult to start without settling the arrears. The survival of education is in great danger. We implore the Finance Department to consider the difficult situation of education in Anhui Province and find a special way to allocate the 445,000 yuan in arrears to provide relief. Furthermore, Cheng Bin, the head of the province's education funding management office, has been in Beijing for several days, seeking immediate allocation of the arrears and discussing long-term plans for stabilizing and ensuring Anhui's education funding. It is also reported that representatives from various schools in the province have gone to the Finance Department to petition for all education funding issues. Since Yang Zhongming took over as the acting director of the provincial education department, his familiarity with Anhui's education sector has allowed him to streamline operations and improve efficiency. His ability to maintain stability during this time of severe financial constraints is truly remarkable. It is now learned that Yang has repeatedly telegraphed the new director, He Qigong, urging him to come to Anhui to take over, so that he can be relieved of his duties, as the schools are currently on break and require numerous matters to be handled. <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<h3 id="e87">Yu Qingtang Visits Bengbu to Inspect the Establishment of Public Education Groups in the Industrial Revitalization Zone. Yu Qingtang, the third section chief of the Jiangsu Education Department, recognizing that many workers in the disaster areas of northern Anhui are uneducated laborers, specifically consulted with the Northern Anhui 12th District Industrial Revitalization Bureau to implement appropriate education for the disaster-affected workers. He especially instructed various social education institutions in Jiangsu to organize public education groups in the Industrial Revitalization Zone. Out of caution, Yu personally came to conduct on-site inspections. On the 21st, he arrived in Bengbu with Tang Moubo and Zhao Guangtao. On the morning of the 22nd, he crossed the Huai River to investigate and express his condolences in various disaster relief work villages. That evening, he visited educational institutions, with a particular focus on social education facilities. Yu will return to Zhenjiang on the 22nd and pass through Nanjing, where he will finalize the organization of the group and begin work in Bengbu soon. <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<h3 id="e88">Huang Shiheng Firmly Declines the Presidency of Hunan University. Hunan University is the highest institution of learning in Hunan Province. The position of president was originally held by Cao Dianqiu, who has now taken office as the Director of the Hunan Education Department and cannot handle both roles. The provincial government then appointed Huang Wangheng, the previous Director of the Education Department, as his successor. However, Huang firmly declined and suggested that the provincial government abolish the position of president and instead establish a committee, with the deans of the university's three colleges (Arts, Science, and Engineering) serving as standing committee members to oversee university affairs. However, the committee system was deemed to lack accountability, and Huang was urged to take office as soon as possible. Huang remains resolute in his refusal and has also stated that if the system is changed to a committee, he would only be willing to serve as an ordinary committee member. His appointment has been returned. <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>

<h3 id="e91">Shanghai Boy Scout Council Requests Central Government to Establish National Headquarters. The Shanghai Boy Scout Council, having previously received a joint petition from the 383rd Group (Guanghua), the 270th Group (Muer Hall), the 121st Group (Southeast Women's Physical Education School), the 250th Group (Dongya), the 347th Group (Shanghai Middle School), the 268th Group (Fudan), and the 196th Group (Liangjiang), requesting permission to forward a telegram to the Central Government urging the prompt establishment of a Boy Scout National Headquarters to fulfill public expectations, after receiving the petition, the council members unanimously agreed that the organization of Boy Scouts in China has always been under a central command, overseeing various groups nationwide. All staff members of the department are concurrently managed by staff of the Central Training Department, which was originally a temporary measure. This time, the central organization has undergone some changes, but the organizational law for the highest Boy Scout agency has not been stipulated. The items presented are deemed necessary to be forwarded. It was decided at the 8th Standing Committee meeting to approve the forwarding of a telegram to the Central Government. The original telegram is excerpted below: (omitted above) The third 83rd and other seven groups claim that peace and unification are being updated in every possible way, aiming to unite the country to resist Japan and save the nation. The people across the country are ecstatic, but no organization or improvement of the central Boy Scout organization has been heard of in the central organization changes. Since the Party has led the national Boy Scout since the 15th year of the Republic, its achievements have been remarkable. How its future should be carefully planned so that the cause can flourish is truly dependent on the future of the Party and the country. However, the current organizational system of the Boy Scout Command seems imperfect, due to the lack of dedicated personnel to perform their duties, which makes it difficult for superiors and subordinates to be active, and there are many gaps with the group departments of the basic organization. Although the number of Boy Scouts is increasing day by day, its quality is not yet commendable. Now, in order to correct this imperfection and to further advance the entire cause, it is impossible without a sound, independent, lasting, and unchanging political ridicule that can self-manage the economic center. It has been heard that the Central Government has a proposal to organize the Chinese Boy Scout National Headquarters. This is indeed the only way to brighten the future of the Chinese Boy Scout. The duty groups and others, in view of this, specially submitted a joint statement to the Junhui, imploring Ke Ridian to urge the Central Mass Movement Steering Committee to promptly establish the Chinese Boy Scout National Headquarters, to fulfill public expectations and benefit the cause, etc. Accordingly, it is reasonable to request Junhui to approve the establishment of the elementary school teachers' registration. It was learned yesterday that the Shanghai Education Bureau will hold the fifth session of elementary school teachers' registration oral examination and physical examination, which will be held at 1:00 p.m. on the 28th, for candidates from No. 1 to No. 80, and No. 201 to No. 350. From 1:00 p.m. on the 29th, from No. 81 to No. 200, and No. 350 to No. 500. The Shanghai County Education Bureau held its 233rd Bureau Affairs Meeting yesterday afternoon, attended by Director Shi, Zheng Guozhai, Yang Huiming, Lin Weiwen, Niu Zhiyi, Yan Zhongguang, Qian Zhonghou, and Xi Siwu. Director Shi chaired the meeting, and Pan Sansheng recorded the minutes. After the formalities, the reports were omitted. Discussion items: (1) Zhang, the principal of Zhuanqiao Elementary School and the curator of the Farmers' Education Center, requested to resign. The meeting decided to persuade him to stay. (2) Review of the 19th year's annual report of the Bureau. It was decided to promote Mr. Lin Weiwen and Mr. Niu Zhiyi to review. (3) Shen Jing, who also serves as the county's public sports ground, should be replaced by another person due to other appointments. It was decided that Sun Tingfang would take over. The Quanzhang Middle School New House was completed. The Quanzhang Middle School in this city has been restored to school for nearly one year since the Fuhua Road Campus.

The high school department will register on February 8th and start classes on the 9th. After that, the original purpose will still be implemented, guiding students to work hard to resist Japan and save the country, giving priority to not hindering their studies. It is learned that the school has now hired Li Haoshan, an alumnus of Peabody University in the United States with a doctorate in education, as the director of the middle school. Mr. Li has served in the education sector for many years. The Qingjin Physical Education Alumni Association was established.

<p>National Government Relief Committee Fund Revenue and Expenditure Audit Report by the Financial and Accounting Groups</p>
<p>General Overview of Revenue and Expenditure: Since the start of relief efforts on September 10th of last year, they have been dependent on financial resources. After the establishment of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, a financial group was established to manage the treasury, fundraising, purchasing, and international transportation. However, the disaster area was vast, the disaster was severe, and the government's finances were strained, making fundraising difficult. An agreement was made to borrow American wheat, which did not require immediate payment, but the urgent need for post-disaster relief could not be delayed. Since its establishment, the Financial Group has spared no effort in soliciting donations from domestic and foreign individuals and organizations, and has received enthusiastic support from all walks of life, with remarkable results. The receipt of relief funds since April has been announced and acknowledged on a weekly basis. The revenue and expenditure situation is analyzed and described as follows:</p>
<p>Analysis of Revenue and Expenditure Items: Up to the end of December 20, the Financial Group received a total of: National currency: $7,798,092.88; US dollars: $471,264.67.</p>
<p>National currency items include donations from all sectors at home and abroad: $6,875,456.05; US dollar allocations: $624,053.76 (equivalent to US$150,000); funds entrusted by the Flood Relief Associations of various provinces to make cotton clothes: $162,000; funds transferred from Fuxin Flour Company for American wheat: $131,383.36; returned surplus funds from Jiangxi rice procurement: $5,150; bank interest: $49.71.</p>
<p>US dollar items: US$471,264.67, is the loan of £140,000 from HSBC by the National Government Relief Committee, using customs duties and disaster relief surcharges to pay for American wheat transportation. The annual interest rate is 7%. Because customs duties are calculated in gold units, the loan is also converted into US dollars and deposited in the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Based on the payment certificates approved by the audit group, the expenditures of the Financial Group up to the end of last December amounted to a total of: National currency: $7,484,545.59; US dollars: $422,742.24.</p>
<p>Expenditures include: Allocations to the disaster area work groups for emergency relief in various provinces: $3,600,138.72 (including US$457,144.35 donated by the American Red Cross for relief in Hubei); $50,000 for the Capital Reception Center; $20,000 for the Shanghai Reception Center; $215,000 for emergency engineering fees and construction fees in the industrial relief area; $131,585 for emergency relief investigation and distribution expenses in various regions; and a total of $45,115.96 for aircraft surveying fees, relief inspection work, and inspector travel expenses.</p>
<p>Expenditures handled by the Financial Group totaled $1,700,758.87, including over $1,165,000 for cotton clothing and bedding, over $379,000 for flour, and $300,000 disbursed by the Health and Epidemic Prevention Group for medicines and expenses. The cost of American wheat was also substantial, with over $553,000 spent on transportation alone, and over US$300,000. The loan from HSBC by the former National Government Relief Committee was used to cover the transportation costs of American wheat. Other expenses, such as the cost of wheat sacks, amounted to over $316,000, and the water transportation expenses for various grain stations amounted to over $137,000.</p>
<p>The above are the major expenditure items. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, there is still a surplus of $313,547.29 in national currency and US$48,522.43.</p>
<p>Decline in Relief Fund Income: From August 19 to December 31, 20, the Financial Group received a total of $6,875,456.05 in relief funds, which has been announced on a weekly basis. In the early stages of the flood, people from all walks of life generously donated to support relief efforts. From September 1st to 10th, the average daily income of relief funds was over $150,000; from September 11th to 20th, the average daily income was over $110,000. Since then, it has been declining. In the most recent period, from January 11th to 20th, the average daily income was only over $3,300, of which donations from overseas Chinese accounted for about 60%. At a time when all industries across the country are declining, the ability of the Chinese people to assist in relief efforts is limited. However, the achievements are commendable. Since the invasion by the Japanese army, the whole country has been in turmoil, and the Chinese people are urgently seeking foreign aid. Internal disasters have gradually been forgotten, which is a major disaster for the 50 million victims.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Fundraising for Relief Efforts: The difficulty of disaster relief is not in the initial emergency relief, but in the implementation of post-disaster plans and fundraising. It has been five months since the flood occurred. Subsequent relief work will focus on the implementation of industrial and agricultural relief. The embankments that collapsed in various provinces will be repaired by the National Government Relief Committee. This project is enormous. American wheat can only cover wages. All other expenses require cash. The losses suffered by farmers in this flood are extremely serious. According to a survey by the Department of Agricultural Economics of Nanjing Jinling University, the losses of farmers in the Jianghuai River basin are estimated at $200 million. The urgent needs of the victims are over $150 million. With spring plowing approaching, post-disaster measures such as embankment repair and seed loans are urgent. American wheat has ended its continuous shipment to China. The transportation cost is substantial and must be paid on time to avoid delaying relief efforts. The above items are all necessary. Industrial and agricultural relief work and American wheat transportation are interconnected and cannot be separated in terms of urgency. Regarding the source of relief funds, the recent daily average income of donations from all sectors is only over $3,000, which is expected to continue to decline. The $30 million disaster relief bonds resolved by the former National Government have not been issued to date. Customs surcharge revenue, as of the end of last December, was only $900,000. Railway passenger ticket surcharges have not been reported by various railway bureaus. In total, as of the end of December, the National Government Flood Relief Committee's expenditure shortfall was approximately $2 million. The £140,000 borrowed from HSBC earlier was used to cover this shortfall. After January, customs surcharge revenue will be allocated to HSBC on a monthly basis to repay the loan in full. The Financial Group has consulted with the Public Debt Fund Management Committee to allocate funds from the $30 million disaster relief bonds that were approved by the former National Government but not issued, to maintain relief efforts. It is estimated that $1.5 million can be allocated in January and $1.7 million can be allocated in February. After March, as American wheat transportation costs decrease, all expenses are expected to be covered by customs surcharge revenue.</p>
<p>An Interesting Case Involving Monk Zhiwen: Arrested for Opium Use, Police Take Photos, Marriage Certificate, and Another Document of Separation</p>
<p>Long-Haired, Robed, Scarred Monk with a Wife and Illegitimate Daughter. Jing'an Temple in West Shanghai is a famous ancient temple that is known for its incense. Recently, Zhiwen, also known as Xu Jinsheng, a monk from the temple, was found to be consuming opium and married to a local woman, Li Cuiyun (27 years old), with whom he has a two-year-old daughter. They lived together in the back room of No. 9 Dahua Lane on Bair Road in the French Concession. The abbot of the temple and donor Wang Banjiang (a teacher at Jing'an Elementary School) found out about this. They believed that the monk's behavior violated the precepts and damaged the temple's reputation. Therefore, Wang, representing the temple, reported to the French Concession Police Station at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday. The head of the police sent detectives Hang Guangfu and Jin Chengshan to arrest him at the address. When they arrived, they found opium paraphernalia in the room. Zhiwen was at home and was immediately arrested. The police took photos of the scene and found a marriage certificate for Li Cuiyun, dated April 3, 13th year of the Republic. It stated: Marriage Certificate: Xu Jinsheng (Zhiwen) and Li Cuiyun. Witness: Min Heng. Matchmaker: Xu Gengsheng and Li Qiaoyun. Master of Ceremony: Li Wenkui. The invitation card read: "A Hundred Years of Harmony." There was also a document of separation between Qian Xiuying and Xu Jinsheng, stating that she received 2,000 silver dollars and would forever sever relations with Xu Jinsheng. It was dated August of the 20th year of the Republic and certified by lawyer Chen Zemin. The detectives brought everything to the police station and sent them to the Second Special Court yesterday. Zhiwen wore a gray crepe de chine camel robe, a silk satin jacket, and a Russian hat. His hair was short, and when he took off his hat, the scars from his ordination were clearly visible. At 3:00 PM, Judge Zhang Shijie, together with Prosecutor Lou Guanguang, took the bench in the Fourth Court to interrogate him. First, police lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case, stating that the police received a report that the defendant was consuming opium. When they went to arrest him, they found opium paraphernalia in the room, so they took photos, arrested the defendant, and sent him to court for prosecution according to the anti-opium law. He requested a postponement to allow the police to investigate. The plaintiff, Wang Banjiang, also recounted the events. When questioned, Zhiwen admitted that his name was Xu Jinsheng but denied consuming opium. Li Cuiyun, holding her child, testified that when the defendant married her, he said he worked at the stock exchange. At that time, he had long hair, and she did not see the scars, so she did not know he was a monk. Judge Zhang ordered a postponement for further questioning and ordered the defendant to be returned to the police station.</p>

<p>Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant to Expand</p>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Department is expanding. According to the director of the department, Zeng Yijing, the construction of new buildings has already begun and is scheduled to be completed by the end of June. Behind the existing factory buildings, a new aircraft assembly plant will be built, 121 feet deep and 50 feet wide, capable of housing six aircraft. On both sides, there will be two-story buildings, 23 feet wide, with the upper floor serving as office space and the lower floor as factories. The entire structure will be steel-framed, with a total construction cost of over 200,000 yuan. This year, it has been decided to manufacture six new aircraft. Construction has already begun. Each aircraft will have 220 horsepower. The first aircraft is scheduled to be completed in July, the second in August, the third in September, the fourth in October, the fifth in November, and the sixth in December. The design will be the same as the newly completed Jiangfeng and Jianghe aircraft. At the same time, a 400-horsepower fighter plane will be manufactured on a trial basis. If the test is successful, mass production can begin next year. Two Moths-type aircraft, rebuilt by the department, have been completed. One has been completed, and the other will be completed by the end of this month. Each aircraft has 90 horsepower and has been named Jiangjiu and Jiang _. They are both training aircraft. In addition, the department plans to gradually establish its own engine manufacturing plant and add machinery to transform manual manufacturing into mechanical manufacturing to accelerate production. If funding is available, this can be carried out. Given China's current situation, aircraft are the most suitable for national defense.</p>
<p>Chapel National Goods Exhibition Extended</p>
<p>The Shanghai Promotion of National Goods Association's Third National Goods Exhibition in Zhabei has been officially open at the Zhabei Charity Group since the 15th of this month. With the exquisite products from various manufacturers, the gorgeous displays, and the promising business prospects, the original exhibition period was scheduled for two weeks. In these days of deepening national crisis, this promotion of national goods movement is a fundamental way to save the country. The association's committee members have recognized this and intend to extend the exhibition period by three days to do their best to promote the national goods movement and facilitate the purchasing of the general public.</p>
<p>Zheng Qi, Director of the National Goods Exhibition Hall, Took Office Yesterday</p>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, after the former director of the Shanghai National Goods Exhibition Hall, Dong Kerren, resigned, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs appointed Zheng Qi to take over. Zheng took Wang Xieping to the hall at 2:00 PM yesterday to take over the position at the urging of Director Mai. The staff of the hall handled the handover. Zheng did not have any ceremony to take over the position, but he summoned all the staff of the hall and gave a brief speech, expressing his determination to actively develop national goods and urging the completion of the new five-story building at the intersection of Ximen and Heping Road as soon as possible. Since the accountant and general affairs officer of the hall had resigned, Zheng temporarily appointed Wang Xieping to take over yesterday. Zheng is from Zhongshan, Guangdong, and is 35 years old. He has served as a member of the National Government Ping Mine Reorganization Committee and editor-in-chief of the Beiping Minguo Daily.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Responds to Correct Two Types of Taxes</p>
<p>Shanghai Special District Citizens Federation previously sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting the correction of the stamp tax penalty rules and the license tax stamp procedures. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance replied with Yin Zi No. 97, stating: "We have received the telegram. The current stamp tax penalty rules, ranging from a minimum of 5 yuan to a maximum of 100 yuan, are already much lighter than the revised tax law of the 3rd year of the Republic, which had penalties up to 200 yuan. These rules are stipulated by regulations and have been implemented for a long time, making it difficult to arbitrarily change them. There are also explicit provisions for stamp duties to be affixed to tobacco and alcohol licenses, and various provinces have been following them for years. It is difficult for the province to be unique. However, for the sake of factual convenience, the stamping procedures for these licenses should be approved by the tobacco and alcohol licensing agencies to follow the tax rates set by the Ministry when filling out the forms and affixing stamps, and merchants should pay the ticket price in full when obtaining the licenses to simplify the process. We have ordered the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau to order its subordinates to comply."</p>
<p>Request to the National Government to Dismiss Chen and Support Zhang</p>
<p>Telegram from the Anhui Provincial People's Self-Rescue Federation to the National Government</p>
<p>To Chairman Lin of the National Government, President Sun of the Executive Yuan, and Members of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Conference:</p>
<p>Chen Diaoyuan, Chairman of Anhui Province, has committed numerous crimes of harming the country and the people, violating laws and disrupting order. The people of Anhui, both inside and outside the province, have urgently appealed against him repeatedly. The National Government's Supervisory Yuan has filed a well-founded impeachment for corruption, which need not be detailed. This time, the central government is rebuilding and determined to reform domestic affairs. The first priority is to eliminate the scourge of warlords and relieve the people's suffering. People like Chen Diaoyuan have no place in a country that is vigorously implementing democratic politics. The people of Anhui are in imminent danger, and relief cannot be delayed even for a day. There are many ways to liberate the people, but the most urgent task is to build a clean and honest government and have a well-disciplined anti-bandit army that strictly enforces the law, so that corruption dare not run rampant in the countryside and order is gradually restored. Shao Yun and others are either farmers or engaged in industry and commerce and have never been involved in politics. However, because of the personal interests and the deep feelings we have, we only know that Mr. Zhang Zhijiang, the current Director of Pacification of Jiangsu, has the spirit of hard work and endurance of the Northwest Army and always cares about the people's livelihood. Although he does not hold military power, his former subordinates, such as Liang Guanying, Zhang Huatang, and Zheng Tingzhen, are full of morale and strict discipline and are happy to listen to Zhang's command. During his year in Jiangsu, he not only achieved remarkable results in suppressing bandits, but also won the deep love and respect of the people. Last year, when there was a major flood, he was able to use his spare time to supervise soldiers to help the people reinforce the dikes in advance and organize emergency relief afterwards. Other efforts to benefit the people are too numerous to mention. Since Jiangsu and Anhui are geographically close, the people of Anhui feel how fortunate the people of Jiangsu are and how miserable the people of Anhui are. We humbly believe that you are concerned about the suffering of the people and are eager to quickly eliminate the scourge of Chen for the people of Anhui and to find a successor who can save Anhui. We dare to uphold the central government's principle of adopting public opinion and represent the public opinion of 300,000 people in Anhui, believing that the person who is not an active soldier but has the power to command, is extremely diligent and honest in his work, and is able to empathize with the people's suffering is Mr. Zhang Zhijiang, the Director of Pacification, who can remedy the damage caused by Chen Diaoyuan and is the resurrection medicine for the people of Anhui. The people of Anhui are eagerly awaiting this and can also convince Chen Diaoyuan and prevent him from making excuses. Shao Yun and others are from the countryside and have no personal grievances. We only want peace in our homeland and the restoration of our old careers. We are different from bureaucrats and politicians who use politics to seek activity. Our sincerity is clear to the world. We humbly request you to examine and approve our request and implement it quickly. We are extremely grateful and devoted.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Anhui Provincial People's Self-Rescue Federation: Tian Shaoyun, Tian Weilin, Ma Chengzhi, Liu Changshi, Xiang Guangfu, Zhang Yizhai, Tian Minxian, Zhou Yuanyu, Wang Zaitian, Lei Zhendong, Tang Mingda, Liu Zhenguo, Sun Yuzhu, Li Dingbang, Zhu Yongnian, Sheng Fuxue, and others, 3,650 people in total.</p>

The agricultural relief personnel in Anhui and Jiangxi have also been assigned. Wei Jingchu, Deputy Director of the Anhui and Jiangxi Agricultural Relief Office, led assistant personnel to Anqing and Nanchang yesterday to prepare everything. The director, Zou Shuwen, and the directors of the Fuhu, Bengbu, and Jiujiang sub-offices, Qiang Peiduo, Du Keming, and Fang Xisan, will also depart from Shanghai in order. The general approach has been finalized through meetings, and a book of agricultural relief instructions has been compiled and published.</p>

<p>Special Donation from the National Lawyers Association</p>
<p>The National Lawyers Association of the Republic of China sent a letter to the Lawyers Associations of various provinces yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Association held a meeting on the 17th of this month. Due to the discussion of the issue of current expenses, it was resolved that in addition to the regular annual donations and additional donations being collected as usual, the various associations will pay a special donation according to the following standards to supplement the funds: 50 yuan for those with 50 or fewer members, 100 yuan for those with more than 50 but less than 200 members, 120 yuan for those with more than 200 but less than 300 members, 140 yuan for those with more than 300 but less than 400 members, 160 yuan for those with more than 400 but less than 500 members, and 200 yuan or more for those with more than 500 members. The special donation should be paid to the Association in two weeks for distant provinces and one week for nearby provinces. We are notifying your Association for your information and request that you pay the special donation in accordance with the resolution to maintain the Association's operations. Yours truly."</p>
<p>Notice of Factory Registration</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association sent a letter to the factory workers of the various associations yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that we have received an instruction from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, which states: 'We have received an order from the Municipal Government approving the consultation from the Ministry of Industry regarding the registration of factories. As the industrial records of our country are lacking in detail, it is inconvenient for industrial administration. The Ministry has formulated twelve articles of factory registration rules and two types of appendices and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing. They were promulgated and implemented by the Ministry on the 18th of this month. In addition to sending the rules and appendices to the provincial and municipal governments for implementation, we are also sending a set of the rules and appendices to your Municipal Government for your information and request that the competent bureau follow the regulations and announce them and present them for filing within a time limit. In the future, those factories that apply for awards according to various incentive regulations should be asked to apply for registration first and then forwarded for review.' In accordance with this, we are copying a set of the rules and appendices and ordering your bureau to comply and also issuing a copy of the rules and appendices for your Association to comply with and inform the various factories. We are enclosing two types of factory registration rules and registration appendices for your information."</p>
<p>News about the Construction of Civilian Housing in Pudong</p>
<p>Reply from the Municipal Government to the Municipal Party Department</p>
<p>The Municipal Government sent a letter to the Municipal Party Department yesterday regarding the construction of civilian housing in Pudong, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the Bureau of Social Affairs has reported the following: 'We are reporting in reply to the Municipal Government's Instruction No. 27, which states: We have examined the documents in the file and approved the letter from the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, stating that the Fifth District Party Department has requested to build civilian housing in Pudong to benefit the shed households and enhance the city's appearance. The Standing Committee has resolved to request your review and reply. We are enclosing the original and duplicate documents for your examination and request that the relevant bureaus discuss and reply. With this order, the attachments are returned.' In accordance with this, the funds available for the construction of civilian housing this year include 120,000 yuan in temporary expenses approved by your government and included in the 20th year general budget, plus over 178,400 yuan in surplus funds borrowed from the Municipal Bank last year, which can be used to build about 800 or 900 houses. In order to save management costs, meet the needs of shed households, and improve the city's appearance, the Bureau of Public Works, Public Security, Finance, and Social Affairs have agreed to add 200 houses to the First Civilian Housing and 700 houses near the Third Housing and submitted their opinions to your government for approval on September 23, 20th year and received Instruction No. 121234 on October 13, stating: 'We have reviewed the report and learned that the case has been approved by the 192nd Municipal Meeting to add 200 houses near the First Civilian Housing and 300 houses near the Third Civilian Housing and to consider adding more houses near Tanzawan or other suitable locations within the scope of the designated funds. We are ordering you to comply.' In accordance with this, the Bureau of Public Works convened the relevant bureaus on January 4th of this year to discuss the location of the new housing. In addition to expanding the First Civilian Housing and temporarily suspending the addition of new houses to the Third Civilian Housing, it was decided to lease the Jinghu Railway base to build the Fourth Housing. The location is west of Datong Road, south of the railway, and north of Jinling Road. The ground is flat and the rent is cheaper, which is more suitable than renting private land. The Land Bureau has sent personnel to contact the leasing. In accordance with the order to review the reasons for building civilian housing in Pudong, we propose to wait for the completion of the survey and measurement of the location and then make a further decision. If there is no balance, the funds will be limited by the budget, and we can only wait for the next year to add more houses. In accordance with the previous order, we have consulted with the relevant bureaus and have reached a consensus. We are submitting the original report and requesting your review and approval. We are respectfully submitting the original and duplicate reports.' In accordance with this, in addition to ordering the release of the instruction and printing it, we are sending a letter to your committee for your information. The original report is attached." (Remainder of the letter omitted)</p>

<p>Details of the Robbery at the Dawang Temple</p>
<p>The home of Tao Yongsheng, a resident of No. 87 Dawang Temple Street, Nanshi, was robbed yesterday around noon. His daughter, Deshu, attempted to call the police and jumped from the drying platform, injuring herself. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yongsheng's Situation: Tao Yongsheng, 45 years old, from Zhenjiang, has been working as a Chinese language teacher at Shanghai Middle School and Dadongmen Yucai Middle School. His wife, Xu, 33 years old, has three daughters: the eldest, Dezhen, 21 years old; the second, Deshu, 19 years old; and the youngest, Defen, 17 years old. They are all studying at Qingxin Girls' Middle School in Chenjiabang. Tao's monthly income is quite good, so the family lives comfortably.</p>
<p>Sudden Arrival of Three Robbers: Yesterday around noon, Tao was out and had not returned home. The family was having lunch in the living room when they suddenly heard a loud noise of someone breaking the door at the back. The maid opened the back door, and three men entered: one wearing a yellow coat and two wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants, speaking in the local dialect. They entered the living room and showed a handgun to intimidate them into silence. Tao's wife and daughters realized they were being robbed and were terrified. The robbers immediately went upstairs and ransacked the bedroom, overturning boxes and cabinets. They took a Shanghai Bank passbook, five silver dollars, and two gold rings from the box and fled with the stolen goods.</p>
<p>When the Police Arrived: Tao's neighbors noticed what was happening and immediately went to report to the police. However, the location was far from the post. When Yang Shilong, the guard from the 24th post, heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, the robbers had already fled with the stolen goods from the front door. The police immediately gave chase. The robbers realized that the police were chasing them and hastily pulled out a gun and fired a shot behind them. Fortunately, it missed. The police continued to chase bravely without firing a shot. However, there were many small alleys in the area, so the robbers quickly disappeared from sight and could not be caught.</p>
<p>Deshu Injured: During the robbery, Tao's second daughter, Deshu, took the opportunity to sneak onto the drying platform and jumped down to call the police. However, she lost her footing and fell to the ground, injuring her waist. Her condition was very serious. Tao's family sent her to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of August 15th of last year, at 6:00 PM, a robbery and murder occurred in Room 2 of the Fashang Inn on Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession. Jiang Zhonghan, Xia Yongsheng, and a man surnamed Xue were killed, and Zhong Ziqing was injured. The police arrested the suspect, Yan Jinbiao, from Funing, and sent him to the Second Special Court. According to his confession, Li Guocheng was the mastermind. Yan was sentenced to death. Yan appealed, but the High Third Branch upheld the death sentence. Yan then appealed to the Supreme Court. Li Guocheng, the main criminal in this case, was arrested by the Public Security Bureau in the Chinese Concession at the end of last year. Yan filed a petition with the court to cross-examine him. The court transferred Li to the case and sent him to the police station of the French Concession for investigation. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Tribunal of the Second Special Court. The criminal court president, Ge Zhiqin, together with Prosecutor Lou Guanguang, took the bench to interrogate him. Li stated that he was 33 years old, from Funing, also known as Li Dongliang, and adopted the surname Chen, so he was also known as Chen Youliang. He lived in Goucun, Funing. The judge ordered the case to be retried. First, police lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case, prosecuting him for murder according to the criminal law. First, Yan's mother, Yan Liangshi, stated that Jinbiao was her second son. Her eldest son had died, and her youngest son was at home. Her daughter-in-law told her that Li Guocheng was the killer. Her daughter-in-law was not present because she was not feeling well. Xu Jiangshi stated that Jiang Zhonghan was her elder brother. He told her that he had a feud with Li Guocheng. Later, she read in the newspaper that he was beaten to death by Li, so she filed a petition to seek justice. Her sister-in-law had returned to her home in Jiangbei. At this point, the judge ordered Yan Jinbiao to be brought to court. Yan stated that he did not call Jiang and the other three to the inn. On June 28th of the lunar calendar, Li Guocheng, Yang Jiucheng, Liu Wu, and Zhang San discussed killing someone at his house. On July 1st, Li and the other three invited Jiang Zhonghan to his house, treated him to tea, and gave him two silver dollars, asking Jiang to invite Xia and the others to the inn. At 5:00 PM on the 2nd, Li and the other three came to his house again. They first ordered noodles and ate until 7:00 PM. Li Guocheng and Yang Jiucheng went to beat them, and Liu Wu and Zhang San went to keep watch. Before leaving, they told him to stay at home and said that if they did not see him at home when they returned, they would kill him. So he waited at home. Later, Yang Jiucheng came and said that one person was not killed and recognized them, telling him to leave quickly. That night, he spent the night on the street. The next morning, he asked his cousin Dai Yunhong to visit his house and was arrested by detectives. Dai then led the detectives to Tiancheng Lane and arrested him. He was truly wronged and asked the judge to ask Li Guocheng to tell the truth. Was he present at the time and did he discuss going to shoot and kill? The previous confession was due to unbearable torture. As for the robbery, Shi Chengwen and others in the prison told him to admit to it. He asked for them to be brought in for questioning. When questioned, Li Guocheng flatly denied the murder. At that time, he was at the Public Security Bureau in Goucun in his hometown. He asked for an investigation. Yan Jinbiao had previously been a thief in Jiangbei and was driven away by him, so he falsely accused him out of hatred. He asked for clarification and hired a lawyer to defend him. At this point, Yan's mother stated again that Li Guocheng was the killer and had promised to give her daughter-in-law 2,000 silver dollars. She asked for a clear verdict. Judge Ge reviewed the statements and ordered a postponement for further questioning on February 9th. Li Guocheng was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Xu Yansheng Receives Two Threatening Letters, Niu Laosan and Yin Jinfa Arrested</p>
<p>Xu Yansheng, a local from Chongye Lane No. 1 on Avenue Foch in the French Concession, had some property, which attracted the attention of bandits. On the morning of the 23rd of this month, at 8:00 AM, when he opened the gate, he found a threatening letter on the ground, demanding 3,000 silver dollars and threatening to use a handgun on him and his wife if the money was not delivered to the brick grave in the wilderness on Fulililu within three days. Xu disregarded the letter. On the morning of the 25th, at 7:00 AM, he found another letter at the door, urging him to deliver</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Circumstances of Yu Youren's Trip South <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Guangdong Authorities Try to Retain Hu, but Hu Does Not Immediately Go to Nanjing</p>
<p>Yu Arrives in Guangdong Solely to Commemorate the Seventy-Two Martyrs</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: On this occasion of Mr. Yu Youren's trip south, his initial purpose upon arriving in Hong Kong was to persuade Hu Hanmin, who was living in seclusion on the island, to prepare for a trip to Nanjing. Before Mr. Yu arrived in Hong Kong, Xiao Focheng and Lin Zhong from Guangdong also arrived in Hong Kong to discuss important matters with Mr. Hu. They had dinner at Mr. Hu's residence on the evening of the 15th, discussing the current situation until about 9 p.m. On the 16th, Mr. Yu Youren drove from his hotel to visit Mr. Hu. After talking for about an hour, Zhang Huichang, who was also traveling south, also visited Mr. Hu. Mr. Hu did not immediately agree to Mr. Yu's earnest request to go north. On the afternoon of the 16th, Xiao Focheng, Lin Jizhong, and Wu Chaoshu from Guangdong jointly visited Mr. Hu at his private residence and discussed matters for a long time. It is said that the outcome was that the three organizations in Guangdong (i.e., the Southwest Executive Department, the Military Commission, and the Political Committee) must be protected, no matter how their names are changed, in order to implement the spirit of balanced power. As for Mr. Hu Hanmin's attitude, he also decided not to go to Nanjing. On the 17th, Mr. Hu publicly issued a statement, saying that his blood pressure was still high, he had been worried and overworked recently, and he was often dizzy. He was so weak that he could not travel north in fact. People generally worry that no one in the central government will take responsibility if Chiang, Wang, and Hu do not enter the capital, but this is a big mistake. The current government system takes the Executive Yuan as the highest organ for exercising governance, and the Executive Yuan is only responsible to the Central Political Council, not to the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee. All major plans are decided by all members of the Central Political Council. The so-called Standing Committee is only responsible for taking turns presiding over the meetings of the Central Political Council. Now that the national crisis is imminent, resisting insults should be the priority. Being busy sending someone off and welcoming someone else, focusing on the person rather than the matter, is a mistake. The central government should set up a special committee to preside over everything, with central guidance from above. Therefore, whether the Standing Committee members go to Beijing is not a problem. The urgent task at present is to recover lost territory externally and suppress bandits and communists internally. He hopes that the current central government will implement revolutionary policies in the spirit of a responsible cabinet. Although he is sick, he will do his best to support it, etc. Seeing that Mr. Hu had already expressed his opinions, Mr. Yu Youren did not want to force him to go north again, so he came to Guangdong to visit the members of the Central Executive Committee in Guangdong and invite them to go north together to face the national crisis. The Guangdong authorities also sent Miao Peinan to Hong Kong to welcome Mr. Yu. Mr. Yu then took the Guangzhou-Kowloon express train to Guangdong on the afternoon of the 18th and arrived in Guangzhou at about 7 p.m. Chen Jitang, Bai Chongxi, Liu Jiwen, and people from the military, government, and party circles all went to the station to welcome him. That evening, Mr. Yu temporarily stayed at the Central Hotel in Xidi. Those traveling with him included Central Executive Committee member Wang Luyi and Yu's secretary Liu Kaizhong. The next day (the 18th), Mr. Yu felt that the national crisis was imminent and the country's affairs had not yet been settled. Stepping on the land of Guangdong, he remembered the martyrs and could not help but sigh. So at about 10 a.m., he went to Huanghuagang to commemorate the seventy-two martyrs, lingering and sighing for a long time before leaving. In the afternoon, he went to Zhixin School to visit and also visited Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and the museum. At about 3 p.m., at the invitation of the authorities, he moved to Tuisi Garden in Dongshan. Mr. Yu, in view of Hu Hanmin's failure to go north, did not express his southern mission in his conversations with people, only saying that he came to Guangdong to meet Guangzhou friends whom he had not seen for many years and to visit the famous revolutionary base, and that he would return north after staying for two or three days. On the 19th, Xiao Focheng and Lin Jizhong, who went to Hong Kong to discuss the current situation with Hu Hanmin, returned to Guangdong and went back with Wu Chaoshu. At 11 a.m. that morning, Chen Jitang, Bai Chongxi, and Liu Jiwen held a banquet at Tuisi Garden to welcome Mr. Yu Youren and Mr. Wu Chaoshu. Xiao Focheng, Lin Yizhong, and dozens of army commanders were also present. During the banquet, the people of Guangdong expressed the following opinions: (1) Because Mr. Hu ZhanTang's blood pressure is still over 170, it is indeed difficult for him to travel far. Please ask him to go north when his spirits recover. (2) The three southwestern organizations were established based on the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session. Please ask Committee Member Yu to explain to the committees in Beijing when he returns north. (3) Regarding the reorganization of southwestern politics, the committees asked Wu Chaoshu to take the position of Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government as soon as possible. (4) The committees also expressed their opinions on the southwestern border issues. They dispersed at 3 p.m. (January 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Zhang Fakui's Troops Depart to Aid Heilongjiang <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>With the Actual Strength of One Division Under Wu Qiwai</p>
<p>Started from Yongzhou on the 4th of this Month</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Zhang Fakui's Fourth Army stationed in Guangxi had previously telegraphed the authorities for permission to depart to aid Heilongjiang. The Guangxi authorities initially considered that the southwest border defense was also important. For the sake of careful consideration, they ordered the troops to postpone their departure from Guangxi. Later, because Zhang Fakui strongly requested to fight for the country and his troops were particularly determined to eliminate the enemy, the headquarters of the Fourth Army Group approved the departure of the troops. However, the Guangxi Army Huang Heling Division (the Tenth Division), which was usually under Zhang's command, could not accompany them due to the importance of southwest national defense. Huang's troops have been ordered by the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Army Group to go to Longzhou to handle pacification matters. Therefore, Zhang Fakui's troops are actually only the Eleventh Division under Wu Qiwai. (Zhang's army suffered great losses due to repeated battles. Since fighting with the 19th Route Army in Hengyang the year before last, it only had one division's strength left after returning to Guangxi.) On the 27th of last month, Wu's division held a meeting to prepare for departure and decided on the steps to take. On the first of this month, a swearing-in ceremony was held in Nanning. Ye Qi, Chief of Staff of the Fourth Army Group, and other officers were present to observe. Ye Qi, in his capacity as Chief of Staff and on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Army Group, gave a speech to all the officers and soldiers of Wu's troops. On the 4th, Wu's troops, led by Deputy Division Commander Han Pingyi, departed. All the groups in Nanning sent representatives to the North Gate to send them off. Wu's troops followed the road north and passed Binyang on the 6th, Qianjiang on the 7th, Liuzhou on the 14th, took the road to Pingle, and arrived at Quanzhou on the 20th, heading towards southern Hunan. It is said that the troops have obtained He Jian's consent to allow them to pass through Hunan. It is said that they will arrive in Nanjing on February 5th. (January 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e94">League of Nations Water Conservancy Experts Arrive in Bengbu <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>To Inspect the Huai River, the Abandoned Yellow River, and the Grand Canal</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Mr. Haas, the Minister of Transportation of the League of Nations from England, and others were invited by our government to come to China to study various issues in China. They have made considerable contributions to various construction projects. Haas is particularly concerned about our country's transportation and water conservancy projects. Last March, he came to Bengbu for a time to investigate the situation of the Huai River. After returning to Beijing, he submitted a general report to the Huai River Guidance Committee, believing that it was a contribution to the implementation of Huai River guidance. Now the National Government has again invited Haas and four transportation and water conservancy experts from the Transportation Department of the League of Nations to investigate the situation of the Shanghai Port, the Huangpu River, Jiangsu, Anhui, the Huai River, and the Tianjin Hai River in order to prepare for the implementation of construction and dredging. The Huai River Guidance Committee specially translated the Huai River guidance plan into English and handed it over to Haas and others for review and suggestions in order to implement the Huai River guidance project in the future. Recently, the National Government invited Haas and others to go north to inspect the situation of the Huai River, the abandoned Yellow River, and the Grand Canal, and sent Cao Boquan, a representative of the National Economic Council, and Xu Junti, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Huai River Guidance Committee, to accompany and entertain them. The Twelfth District Labor Relief Bureau and the Changhuai River Water Police Bureau here have all received telegrams to prepare everything. They have found a transportation villa as a reception center. Wang Huzhen, Director of the Labor Relief Bureau, received a telegram from Beijing a few days ago, saying that the League of Nations experts were expected to arrive on the morning of the 23rd, so yesterday (the 22nd) at 1 p.m., he invited representatives from various organizations and groups to the third floor of the transportation villa to discuss reception and protection matters. It was decided that the Bengbu Public Security Bureau, the Water Police Bureau, the Military Police Supervision Office, and the 47th Army Division would be responsible for reception and protection. Today (the 23rd) at 2 p.m., the military police forces were deployed separately. The Military Police Supervision Office, the Public Security Bureau, and the Water Police Bureau were responsible for guarding the reception center (i.e., the transportation villa). A company of the 47th Division was responsible for guarding the area from Erma Road to Dama Road Station. The Public Security Bureau's security team was on guard at the station. Those who arrived at the station to welcome them included Shen Yuanzhen, Director of the Military Police Supervision Office, Zhao Chunpu, Director of the Bengbu Public Security Bureau, Lu Fengshu, Director of the Water Police Bureau, Wang Huzhen, Director of the Twelfth Labor Relief Bureau, and Gao Weixuan, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. At 3:40 p.m., the experts took the second train into the station. The security team paid their respects. Haas, the Minister of Transportation of the League of Nations, was unable to come due to his recent appointment as Secretary-General of the League of Nations Investigation Team, his busy affairs, and his slight indisposition. Those who arrived were Englishman Gaode, Frenchman Berliaux, German Sivikin, and Dutchman Budley. The National Government also sent Cao and Xu, two specialists, to accompany them. After the four foreigners got off the train, Wang Huzhen introduced them to the crowd through a translator. They then went out of the station together and took a car to the third floor of the transportation villa to rest. It is said that they are scheduled to depart from Bengbu tomorrow morning (the 24th) to survey the Huai River. The Water Police Bureau has prepared a large Yuda steamboat and sent thirty to forty water police officers on the Chang'an warship, along with sixty armed soldiers from the 47th Division, to protect them. The Anhui Northern Suppression Headquarters has also telegraphed the counties along the Huai River to provide additional protection when the experts arrive. It is said that the four experts are planning to sail up the river first, pass through Huaiyuan and arrive at Fengtai for a day of inspection, spend the night on the road, and then return to Bengbu and sail down to Wuhe and the Hongze Lake to Jiangba to inspect the river shape, waterway, transportation, water disaster, and the achievements of labor relief and dike construction. From Jiangba, they will take a car to Huaiyin to inspect the abandoned Yellow River, then go south along the Grand Canal to inspect the Grand Canal project, and return to Beijing from Zhenjiang to report. The inspection is scheduled to be completed in two weeks. During the inspection period, all travel expenses will be borne by the National Government. (January 23rd)</p>

<p>The High Court Executes a Criminal. Zhou Awu, a tea room employee of the Shanghai Wuhua Road Refining Company, a native of Dongshan, Dongting, was 37 years old. He was in charge of the front and back door locks of the company. On January 3rd of last year, he colluded with four unknown people and apprentice Shi Ruijing to chop the accountant Xu Kuijun to death with an axe and steal more than 3,400 yuan of silver dollars from the iron box. Later, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau arrested and sent him to the local court, where he and Shi Ruijing were sentenced to death. Shi and others refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court, which changed Shi's sentence to five years in prison, while Zhou's death sentence was upheld. Yesterday (the 26th) at 8 a.m., Prosecutor Sun Xiyan from the High Procuratorate escorted Zhou to Wangshudun outside Yanmen and executed him by shooting.</p>

<p>The Farmer Shooting Case May Be Resolved. When Wang Hongyu, the former head of the tenth district of this county, was in office, farmers rioted due to famine and the police suppressed them improperly, resulting in the shooting of four farmers. Subsequently, the villagers in the district accused Wang of ordering the shooting and filed a complaint with the provincial government and the High Court. As a result, Wang was dismissed from his post. After the Wuxian District Court investigated the case once, Wang Hongyu and the police squad leader Jin Dingxun were detained. Later, the prosecutor did not prosecute Wang for one part of the case and allowed him to be released on bail. As for squad leader Jin, he had admitted to ordering the shooting, so he was prosecuted. The court held another hearing the day before yesterday, but the plaintiff Shen Zhongshan and the families of the deceased did not appear in court. It is said that the case has been mediated and the plaintiff has agreed, but they must request compensation for the families of the deceased. The defendant is also very willing, so this case is expected to be resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>Fishing Boat Outside Hupu Port Engages in Fierce Battle with Bandit Ship. Hupu Town in this county is located on the riverside and is an important town in our county. It mainly exports bean cakes, fish, and shrimp. Recently, the fishing industry has become more developed. There are often merchant ships from Dalian, Shandong and other places coming and going, but bandits are rampant in the river and merchant ships do not dare to travel alone. Whenever there are exports, they often travel in groups. The other day, the Jinfulong boat from Hupu Town loaded goods in Dalian and arrived in Shanghai. After unloading, it sailed back to Hupu from Wusongkou. Unexpectedly, when passing the Jiangmian area of ​​Sheshan Weng, a small ship suddenly came opposite. Seeing that the people on the ship were carrying guns and other weapons, they knew they had encountered bandits. The crew of the ship used the ship's own guns to load bullets and prepare, while still sailing forward. The pirate ship had fifty or sixty pirates. Knowing that the other party was prepared, they immediately fired their guns. The crew of the ship saw them firing and immediately fired back. The sound of gunfire filled the river for about half an hour. Two of the crew members were shot and injured. Seeing that they were outnumbered and running out of ammunition, they had to retreat. However, the bandit ship was still chasing closely. Fortunately, they were able to escape thanks to the favorable wind and tide. After the Jinfulong ship arrived in Hupu, it sent the two injured crew members to the Suzhou Boxi Hospital for treatment. It is said that the crew members were fortunately not shot in vital areas and there is no danger to their lives.</p>

<p>Communist Zhu Yongtai's Case Clarified as a False Accusation. Zhu Yongtai, a communist, was arrested the year before last and interrogated by the county government's temporary court, but no conclusion has been reached. Yesterday, Chen Shitao, a judge from the county court, re-examined the case and summoned Zhu A'er, the person who reported him, for questioning. After repeated questioning, it was discovered that Zhu Yongtai was not a communist. However, he was usually a rogue and had seduced a village girl, incurring the anger of the villagers, who then reported him for joining the Communist Party. Now that there is no solid evidence, the anti-revolutionary part of the case is not established and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 28th.</p>
<p>Bandits Rob and Shoot the Owner. Zhang A'er, a guest resident of Taoyuan Village, Kaiyuan Township, Fourth District of the county, was suddenly visited by more than a dozen bandits on the night of the day before yesterday. They each carried handguns and flashlights and broke into the house. At that time, the men and women of the Zhang family were all asleep. After the bandits entered the room, they immediately grabbed Zhang A'er and forced him to say where the silver was hidden. A'er's answer provoked the bandits' anger, and they pulled out their handguns and fired two shots at A'er's legs. A'er fell to the ground in extreme pain, unconscious. The bandits then ransacked the cabinets, looting on a large scale. After an hour, they left with their loot.</p>

According to a report from Zhang Yiwu, an advisor to the 121st Brigade of the 61st Division stationed in Zhenjiang, the Wuchang steamboat was carrying a large amount of opium to Zhenjiang.
