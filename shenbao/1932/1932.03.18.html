<p>時評</p>
<h3>「滿蒙」是日本的生命綫嗎（二彬·）</h3>
<p>丨謹貢獻於國聯調查團丨</p>
<p>爲了自身的利益。日本的軍閥財閥與政客一致主張對滿蒙積極政策。而以「日本人口問題應於滿蒙求解决」之狂呼。欺騙國際人士。麻醉彼國人民以掩飾其侵略的野。心此一反宣傳。在日本學者室伏高信氏無情的揭露之下。其眞相當已爲世界人士所灼見。室伏氏所謂「此種積極論不過僅爲滿鐵總裁·政黨政治家·滿洲浪人·及一部分企業家之要求」。誠可謂爲「一針見血。」</p>
<p>再從另一方面觀察近二十五年來日本移居「滿蒙」的人口。除官更與滿鐵從業人員而外／爲數僅九萬餘人。這不僅已指出了「滿蒙」决不是日本的生命綫。反之另一方面的事實却明白地證明滿蒙確爲中國的生命線。　　室伏氏在同書中曾說「山東移民最近七年間。（一九二二年至一九二九年）共有五百萬定住者近二百五十萬。我們試考量此正確的事實。則滿蒙非日本人口問題的解决地實山東人口問題的解决地。」二十五年間日本移殖「滿蒙」的人口。不過九萬人。而七年間山東移殖「滿蒙」的人口。已達二百五十萬。「滿蒙」究是誰的生命綫呢。這不已經是無須辯論的問題了嗎。</p>
<p>其實室伏氏所指陳的事實。還只是極小的一部分。依據我國方面統計。（見東北年鑑）十七年關内各省移殖「滿蒙」的人口。總數達一百零八萬九千人。十六年與十八年。年都在一百萬以上。從此種鉅大的數字而觀。即可想見我關内各省人口之稠密。與生活之艱難。那末滿蒙之確爲我生命線。不尤其成爲鐵一般的事實。絶對的不可否認嗎。</p>
<p>「滿蒙」爲我國的領土。我國握有不可侵犯的主權。就令退一步說滿蒙爲日本的生命線。但究依據於何種理由。得以强力掠取呢。英屬澳大利亞。美國西部各州。尤其是加州不是都較中國爲地曠人衡嗎。但對於日本的移民。都加以嚴厲的限制然則日本除以强權解釋公理而外。所謂「滿蒙爲日本生命線」的呼喊還有存立的餘地嗎。再退一步言就令滿蒙誠爲日本的生命線。但如上述事實。亦足證明其確爲我國的生命線日本又究依據於何種理由。可以奪取我國人民的生存權。專以維持日本人的生存呢這又是人道與正義所允許的嗎。</p>
<p>最近滿蒙在日人一手包辦之下。已經成立了所謂滿洲僞國。在僞國還未成立之前。對於主人地位的關内移民。即很迅速的加以禁止。抱有獨占的野</p>
<p>心。這即是日本的軍閥與財閥們實際剝奪中國人民的生存權。破壞中國領土的完整。全世界愛護公理與人道的人們。其注意此種陰謀的手段呵。</p>

<h3>Is "Manchuria and Mongolia" Japan's Lifeline? (By Erbin)</h3>
<p>丨Respectfully Contributed to the League of Nations Inquiry Commission丨</p>
<p>For their own interests, Japan's militarists, zaibatsu, and politicians are unanimously advocating an aggressive policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia, clamoring that "Japan's population problem should be resolved in Manchuria and Mongolia." They deceive international figures and anesthetize their own people to conceal their aggressive ambitions. This propaganda has been ruthlessly exposed by Japanese scholar Takashin Murofushi, and its true nature has already been clearly seen by the world. Murofushi stated, "This aggressive theory is merely the demand of the South Manchuria Railway President, party politicians, Manchurian adventurers, and a segment of entrepreneurs." This can truly be described as "hitting the nail on the head."</p>
<p>Furthermore, observing the population of Japanese who have immigrated to "Manchuria and Mongolia" in the past twenty-five years, excluding government officials and South Manchuria Railway employees, the number is only over 90,000. This not only indicates that "Manchuria and Mongolia" are definitely not Japan's lifeline, but conversely, the facts clearly demonstrate that Manchuria and Mongolia are indeed China's lifeline. Murofushi stated in the same book, "In the past seven years (1922 to 1929), Shandong immigrants had approximately 5 million permanent residents, with nearly 2.5 million settlers. If we consider these accurate facts, then Manchuria and Mongolia are not the solution to Japan's population problem, but the solution to Shandong's population problem." Over twenty-five years, the Japanese population that has immigrated to "Manchuria and Mongolia" is no more than 90,000, while in seven years, the Shandong population that has immigrated to "Manchuria and Mongolia" has reached 2.5 million. Whose lifeline are "Manchuria and Mongolia" after all? Isn't this a question that requires no debate?</p>
<p>In fact, the facts pointed out by Murofushi are only a very small part. According to statistics from our country (see the Northeast Yearbook), in the seventeenth year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1928], the total number of people who immigrated to "Manchuria and Mongolia" from the provinces within the Great Wall reached 1,089,000. In the sixteenth and eighteenth years [1927 and 1929], the annual number was over one million. From such a large figure, it can be imagined how dense the population and how difficult life is in our provinces within the Great Wall. So, isn't the fact that Manchuria and Mongolia are indeed our lifeline even more ironclad and absolutely undeniable?</p>
<p>"Manchuria and Mongolia" are our country's territory, and our country holds inviolable sovereignty. Even if we take a step back and say that Manchuria and Mongolia are Japan's lifeline, based on what reason can they forcibly seize them? Aren't British Australia and the western states of the United States, especially California, more sparsely populated than China? But they all impose strict restrictions on Japanese immigrants. Then, besides using power to interpret justice, is there any room for the so-called "Manchuria and Mongolia are Japan's lifeline" cry to exist? Taking another step back, even if Manchuria and Mongolia are truly Japan's lifeline, as the facts above demonstrate, it is sufficient to prove that they are indeed our country's lifeline. Based on what reason can Japan seize our people's right to survival and exclusively maintain the survival of the Japanese people? Is this permitted by humanity and justice?</p>
<p>Recently, under Japan's complete control, the so-called puppet state of Manchuria has been established. Before the puppet state was established, the immigration of people from within the Great Wall, who were in the position of the masters of that land, was quickly prohibited, harboring ambitions of exclusive control. This is precisely the Japanese militarists and zaibatsu actually depriving the Chinese people of their right to survival and destroying the integrity of Chinese territory. May all people in the world who cherish justice and humanity pay attention to these insidious means.</p>
<h3>Press Circles Host the League of Nations Inquiry Commission</h3>
<p>Shi Liangcai Delivers a Welcome Speech</p>
<p>Lord Lytton Gives a Sincere Reply</p>
<p>Gu Weijun Hosts a Grand Banquet Last Night</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, the League of Nations Inquiry Commission has been warmly welcomed by all sectors of society for several consecutive days. Yesterday afternoon, representatives of the local press hosted a banquet at the International Recreation Club. At 8 PM, our country's representative Gu Weijun hosted a celebratory banquet at Rong Zongjing's residence. The Inquiry Commission is scheduled to inspect the war zone on the 21st and has agreed to meet with representatives of various public organizations in Shanghai on a fixed date. The various news items are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Press Circles' Luncheon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association hosted a public banquet for the League of Nations Inquiry Commission at the International Recreation Club yesterday afternoon. Present were Commission Chairman Lord Lytton, U.S. Representative McCoy, French Representative Claudel, German Representative Schnee (Italian Representative Scialoja was absent due to illness), Government Representative Gu Weijun, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, former Envoy to Italy Wang Guangqi, President of Tongji University Ruan Jiepan, General Manager of Shen Bao Shi Liangcai, Manager of Xinwen Bao Wang Boqi, General Manager of Shishi Xinbao Zhang Zhuping, Editor of the China Press Dong Xianguang, Editor of Millard's Review Powell, as well as Qian Bohan and Ma Yinliang from Shen Bao, Wang Zhongwei from Xinwen Bao, Zhu Yingpeng from Shishi Xinbao, Jiang Zongdao from Shibao, etc. Shi Liangcai served as chairman and delivered a welcome speech. Commission Chairman Lord Lytton gave a reply.</p>
<h3>Shi Liangcai's Welcome Speech to the League of Nations Inquiry Commission</h3>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, in the face of the grave situation of being forcibly held hostage and in the midst of the bleak environment of being devastated by artillery fire, we are truly honored and delighted to be able to meet the envoys of the League of Nations Inquiry Commission, who bring the dawn of justice and peace. Here, we would like to express our sincere and respectful welcome. The members of the Inquiry Commission have been entrusted with a solemn mission by the League of Nations, traveling across the vast ocean to conduct an on-site investigation into the unfortunate conflict between China and Japan. This work is for China, for Japan, and for the League of Nations. Your visit is jointly and eagerly anticipated by all those in the world who cherish justice and peace. It will hold an eternal and indelible glory in the history of human civilization. The unfortunate situation between China and Japan, from last year's Wanbaoshan incident of Koreans massacring overseas Chinese to the Japanese military's sudden seizure of Shenyang on September 18th, and the current Shanghai catastrophe, demonstrates that world peace has encountered a huge reef. Whose responsibility is this? After your on-site investigation, you will surely obtain a fair and clear answer. The members of the Inquiry Commission are upright, and there are countless upright people in the world who are casting their infinite hopes on your visit with upright eyes. Under your on-site investigation, I think you will give the world a just answer to those who are eagerly hoping. Facts and theories are both presented before your eyes, and we do not need to elaborate. However, there is something that we must explain, that Japan has not only committed dishonest acts with its own hands, but also strives to suppress all upright voices. We are members of the press, and we deeply know our responsibility to jointly seek human peace and well-being, while also strictly exposing actions that persecute human peace and well-being. However, the Qingdao Min Guo Daily was burned by the Japanese, and the Shanghai Min Guo Daily was forced to cease publication under Japanese threat. In addition, the same thing happened in Fuzhou, Changsha, and Beiping. On the 15th of this month, a Tianjin dispatch reported that the Ta Kung Pao was threatened by the Japanese Consul for publishing an illustration. Ladies and gentlemen, Japan has committed many acts of injustice and is trying to suppress our upright voices, covering the eyes and ears of the world. But hasn't world opinion already issued upright voices? Isn't it even more united recently? It can be seen that the eyes and ears of the world cannot be completely covered up, and this kind of behavior can never be forgiven by upright people in the world. To the members of the League of Nations Inquiry Commission, we do not want to make any demands. But the responsibility of the League of Nations is to uphold justice and maintain peace. Our only demand is also justice and peace. But we believe that we should uphold justice and strive for peace, and never sacrifice justice for peace. Peace that is in line with justice is glorious and eternal. Peace that goes against justice can never maintain its permanence in fact, and it is not hoped for by upright people all over the world. In the past ten years, the League of Nations has accumulated indelible glory in investigating international disputes. We eagerly hope that the League of Nations will always maintain this glory, because the glory of the League of Nations is the glory of the whole world and the well-being of all mankind. Members of the Inquiry, we respectfully wish you good health for the peace of the world and mankind.</p>
<h3>Lord Lytton's Reply</h3>
<p>Commission Chairman Lord Lytton replied, "I am deeply grateful for the kindness of you gentlemen in hosting our delegation. I rise to express my gratitude. I do not know how to express the gratitude of my colleagues. My colleagues are fortunate to remain silent, gathered together, all being the most authoritative figures. I am now presumptuous in speaking, and I am truly overwhelmed with trepidation. We have heard that Japan has militarists and China has militarists. However, the authority wielded by the militarists of the world is not enough to match the chairman of today's banquet. Yesterday, we received a celebratory banquet from university professors. I ventured to say that today's teachers are tomorrow's soldiers. Will you allow me to call you teachers of adult men and women? If so, then you can be our friends, or you can be our enemies. People often use various terms to compare our delegation. We also often use metaphors in our speeches. Therefore, I will use another metaphor today and view my colleagues as planters. Now, in the capacity of planters, I implore the members of the press to make the land where we scatter seeds fertile. You have just told the members of our delegation that what you require is only justice. Your intention is good, for the tree of peace can only thrive when planted in the land of justice. However, in English, the words 'justice' and 'judgment' are homophones but have different meanings. Judgment is the domain of the courts, but one country judging another cannot create an environment of justice. I believe that justice between countries is a mutual relationship. It requires mutual understanding, mutual harmony, and consideration of the interests and needs of various countries in order to seek justice. Gentlemen, I have presumptuously called you teachers, but I would never dare to consider myself a principal. The reason I have made such presumptuous remarks is that my colleagues need your help very much, and without your help, we cannot help you. I often notice that when we talk about peace, we often unintentionally use words of war (this may be an unfortunate relic of the past). Therefore, I will now use a military metaphor to conclude my remarks. I dare to say that when the newspapers of the world unanimously support the army of peace, the victory of justice will be determined. Therefore, you are truly friends of our peace work. I respectfully raise a toast to the health of the Chinese press."</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun's Dinner Party</h3>
<p>Government Representative to the League of Nations Inquiry Commission Gu Weijun hosted a dinner party for the delegation at Rong Zongjing's residence at 120 Seymour Road last night at 8 PM. Present were all the members of the delegation, as well as Secretary-General Haas, Secretary Wu Xiufeng, and Central Committee members Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Mayor Tiecheng, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi, Advisor Baudouin, Dr. Roos, Chinese members of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and representatives of various organizations. Representative Gu addressed the delegation, and Lord Lytton replied. The event ended at around 10 PM.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun's Welcome Speech</h3>
<p>I am honored to have been appointed as a representative participating in the League of Nations Inquiry Commission, and I am overjoyed to have the opportunity to welcome you today. You are either statesmen, military figures, or diplomats, famous throughout the world. The League of Nations' appointment of you to come to China to investigate the Sino-Japanese dispute can be said to be a fitting choice. I welcome you because you are believers in justice and peace. During this time of national crisis, although we cannot hold a grand welcome, our welcome is sincere and warm. You come from the League of Nations, and the League's basic principles are most in line with China's historical ideals. From Confucius to the Neo-Confucians of the Song Dynasty, they spared no effort in advocating the ideal of treating fellow citizens as siblings and all things as partners. The spirit of the League of Nations is the spirit of Chinese culture. Therefore, when the establishment of the League of Nations was proposed, I was one of the first to support the establishment of this association. At that time, the chairman of the committee drafting the Covenant was the former President of the United States, and I also participated in the deliberations. At the beginning of the League of Nations' establishment, I also served as a member of the Executive Council and participated in the General Assembly. All of this has been a fortunate experience in my life. As you enter China, you have probably already noticed the new movement and new life of the Chinese nation. As you travel, you will be able to further understand the vastness of China's territory, the abundance of its population, and the complexity of its problems. Those who grow up near China may neglect this, but you come from afar and have no preconceived notions. You will surely be able to observe China with a fair eye. China is currently in a period of transition. The country is being reformed, with metabolism proceeding at a rapid pace. Recently, foreign troops have invaded, and the situation has gradually escalated. The damage suffered by China will be reserved for a comprehensive presentation later, but the prospects for China's transformation have been greatly impacted by this, and the government's actions have been severely hampered as a result. Needless to say, during your investigation, you will be able to discover that the Chinese people are extremely excited about the Sino-Japanese relations. However, if you conduct further research, you will know that the Chinese people's indignation is actually a reaction to the policy of force against China. Although the ways of expressing indignation vary, whether through language, writing, or differentiating in the purchase of foreign goods, the reasons are all outside of China and are not controlled by China. In other words, the various incidents after September 18th have had a particularly significant impact. Your Inquiry Commission's mission is not only valued by China, but also deeply concerned by various countries around the world. Statesmen with a long-term vision have painstakingly used the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact to guide the world towards peace. However, whether these covenants can serve as sound principles for international relations and whether they have the effect of guaranteeing peace has now become a major question. Whether the Peace Pact can be implemented and what the future of the world will be are now problems. However, the League of Nations is extremely concerned about the current issue in the Far East and is constantly striving to maintain peace and seeking a permanent solution. In addition, the United States is sincerely cooperating in maintaining peace. Your delegation is investigating the truth on the ground, and I firmly believe that there will be appropriate measures to respect China's territorial and administrative integrity. The dignity of the Peace Pact will surely be restored.</p>
<h3>Dr. Schnee's Conversation</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, when the press circles hosted the Inquiry Commission, German Commissioner Dr. Schnee happened to be seated across from our newspaper's reporter. He appeared sincere and possessed the demeanor of a scholar. After exchanging pleasantries with the reporter, they talked about the past and the present, engaging in a very enjoyable conversation. Dr. Schnee praised China for first inventing gunpowder and paper, praising the long history of Chinese culture. Then, they talked about the current Shanghai incident. Dr. Schnee said that when the USS Adams entered the Wusongkou, although it was already dusk, the artillery fire and shrapnel marks in the Wusong area were still faintly discernible. The reporter informed him that Tongji University, which has close ties to German science and culture, was also among the rubble and ruins. Dr. Schnee sighed with emotion upon hearing this. The reporter then asked, "Is the Inquiry Commission scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 26th of this month?" Dr. Schnee replied, "Currently, the Inquiry Commission, in view of the urgent need to restore Shanghai to its original state, has decided to extend its stay in Shanghai, hoping to have a reasonable grasp on the Shanghai peace issue before departing for Nanjing." The reporter asked, "I heard that the Inquiry Commission intends to participate in the Shanghai ceasefire conference and try to mediate. Is this certain?" Dr. Schnee replied, "First, both sides must be willing to sincerely invite us, then the Inquiry Commission may not be unwilling to exert its modest efforts. Second, even if both sides invite us, the delegation cannot participate automatically. We must send a telegram to Geneva and wait for the League of Nations' instructions before we can decide." At that time, a waiter brought in soup, which was named "World Peace Cream Soup." The reporter told Dr. Schnee that the name of the soup was novel. Dr. Schnee said that the cream was smooth and palatable, and the word "peace" was truly fitting. After speaking, they smiled at each other.</p>

<h3>Remarks by Dr. Schnee</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, during the League of Nations Inquiry Commission's reception, Dr. Schnee, the German committee member, happened to sit opposite this newspaper's reporter. He appeared earnest and possessed the demeanor of a scholar. After exchanging greetings with the reporter, they chatted at length about the past and the present, enjoying a very pleasant conversation. Dr. Schnee greatly praised China for being the first to invent gunpowder and paper, lauding the extensive history of Chinese culture. Turning to the recent Shanghai incident, Dr. Schnee commented that when the USS Adams entered Wusongkou, even though it was dusk, the artillery and shrapnel marks in the Wusong area were still faintly visible. The reporter informed him that Tongji University, which has close ties to German science and culture, was also among the rubble and ruins. Dr. Schnee sighed with emotion upon hearing this.

<h3>Mayor Wu's Return Visit</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng, accompanied by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, went to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund yesterday afternoon at 3 PM to return the visit to the League of Nations Inquiry Commission. They had a very pleasant conversation and left at around 4 PM.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Meetings with Public Organizations</h3>

<h3>Compilation of Letters and Telegrams from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The report of six organizations: Since the League of Nations Inquiry Commission arrived in Shanghai, they have been very concerned about the issue of the resumption of business in Shanghai. The Citizens' Joint Association, the General Association of Commercial Circles, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, the Shanghai French Concession Commercial Association, the Shanghai National Salvation Association of various organizations, and the Chinese National Salvation Ten-Person Association have initiated and prepared a report to be submitted to the delegation for review, in order to express public opinion. This book has now been completed. The following is the original text of the fourth chapter of the report, which explains the facts of the strike. Since the Japanese militarists attacked Zhabei on the night of January 28, 1932, the public concession area north of the Suzhou River, within the defensive perimeter of the Japanese army, immediately fell into a state of terror because the Japanese army used it as a base of operations. Not only did countless Chinese taxpayers suffer misfortune, as described in the third chapter, but also the organs of the Municipal Council exercising police power and Chinese and foreign police officers were disarmed, killed, and injured. They even witnessed police stations being occupied and plainclothes personnel without duties arresting innocent people, and were unable to resist. Therefore, Chinese merchants who paid taxes outside of these terror zones, in view of the Municipal Council's lack of ability and the foreign countries' Defense Committee being forced to remain silent by military force, had to strike to avoid the same unfortunate fate. In addition, the following signatory groups—the Shanghai Special Municipality Citizens' Joint Association, the Shanghai Commercial Circles Joint Association, and the Chinese National Salvation Ten-Person Association—expressed their opinions to the Municipal Council from the position of a group of Chinese taxpayers, expressing their willingness to lead all members to do everything possible to assist the Municipal Council in recovering the seized police power and restoring the original state of administrative integrity. They also suggested that the Municipal Council immediately convene a Chinese and foreign taxpayers' meeting to cooperate. Although the Municipal Council did not adopt it, the Municipal Council replied that it had increased the number of troops dispatched from various important countries and was striving to recover police power. However, this promise has not been fully realized to this day. Therefore, although the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has advised various Chinese taxpayers to resume business, most Chinese taxpayers dare not resume business because the Municipal Council has not increased its strength to ensure safe business operations and has no solution for Chinese and foreign taxpayers who are still suffering in the terror zones. Only a few stores provide prepared business for the convenience of assisting public needs. Therefore, the current state of strike in Shanghai is caused by the Japanese army's destruction of the Municipal Council's police power, disruption of the Municipal Council's administrative order, and illegal acts. The signatories below hope that your delegation can persuade the military leaders of the countries participating in the Defense Committee in Shanghai to rise up and use their power to condemn members who violate their defense responsibilities, based on the principles of defense, in order to maintain the overall safety and order of the public concession. Otherwise, the progress of the development of commerce by various countries in Shanghai will be left with an evil precedent that can be destroyed.</p>
<h3>Public Letter from Library Staff</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that more than 50 staff members from various libraries in Shanghai jointly sent a letter to the League of Nations Inquiry Commission yesterday (16th), denouncing the Japanese invasion. It stated, "We are all staff members of various libraries in Shanghai. Please extend to the gentlemen of your delegation our warmest welcome. We wish you a successful investigation. Now, taking advantage of your arrival in Shanghai, we dare to state our indignation at the Japanese invasion. The losses suffered by our country's lives and property due to the bombing of Japanese cannons and aircraft are countless. And the destruction of university libraries in the three northeastern provinces and near Shanghai is even more devastating. Among them, the losses of the Oriental Library and the libraries of Fudan and Tongji Universities are even more regrettable. Precious books, rare manuscripts that are unique in the country, have been turned to ashes. Not only the library and our country have suffered losses, but the whole world has also suffered. We dare to use your delegation to announce to the world that the damage to life and property and the significant losses to our culture are all solely the responsibility of the Japanese. We also hope that your delegation will report to the League of Nations and take effective measures to stop the Japanese atrocities and maintain world peace."</p>
<h3>Welcoming from All Circles in Beijing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the various Chambers of Commerce and labor unions of Beijing telegraphed Mayor Wu, relaying their welcome to the League of Nations Investigation Commission, the original telegram is as follows: ㈠ Telegram from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: To the honorable members of the League of Nations Investigation Commission, care of Mayor Wu of Shanghai. The world is united in indignation at the current Japanese aggression. Your visit to China is timely, and it is hoped that with your just and forthright words, the Sino-Japanese dispute can be resolved satisfactorily. As the sea and sky come into view, we eagerly await your arrival. Respectfully, the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce. ㈠ Telegram from the labor unions: To the League of Nations Investigation Commission, care of Mayor Wu of Shanghai. We are delighted to learn of your mission to East Asia for investigation and extend our sincere welcome. Respectfully, the labor unions of the capital.</p>
<h3>Telegram from All Circles in Fujian</h3>
<p>Various organizations, including the Fujian Businessmen's Alliance, telegraphed saying: To the honorable members of the League of Nations Investigation Commission, translated and forwarded by Mayor Wu of Shanghai. The League of Nations, in order to understand the Japanese aggression against China, has specially sent your commission to China for investigation. Our alliance, etc., hereby express our most sincere welcome. Unfortunately, our country suffered an unprecedented flood last year, and Japan, rejoicing in our misfortune and taking advantage of the economic panic of various countries unable to attend to it, violated all international non-war treaties, and from September 18th, seized 200,000 square miles of our Northeast territory. For the sake of world peace, our country did not want to resort to arms and requested the League of Nations to handle the matter fairly according to its charter. Although resolutions were passed on September 30th, October 22nd, and October 10th, Japan consistently ignored them and became even more tyrannical. Moreover, it mobilized its entire military force and a large fleet, and on January 28th of this year, in Shanghai, the commercial center of the Far East, wantonly bombed with airplanes, bombs, and heavy artillery, inflicting extreme cruelty, resulting in countless losses of life and property. Our 19th Route Army had the responsibility to defend the territory and resisted in self-defense, and had already complied with the understanding reached at the meeting on the British flagship HMS Kent. However, Japan, on the one hand, propagandized a ceasefire to deceive the League of Nations, and on the other hand, actively took advantage of our army's withdrawal to invade Jiading, Taicang, and other places, and bombed our Suzhou and Hangzhou, threatening the capital. Our alliance, etc., believing that your commission has the direct and indirect mission of maintaining world peace, respectfully, on behalf of the 30 million people of the entire province, solemnly declare the following points: ㈠ Japan's contempt for international treaties and good faith should bear the responsibility for destroying peace in East Asia and the world. ㈡ All our country's past actions have been expressions of upholding world justice and fairness, and supporting international covenants and League of Nations resolutions. ㈢ The League of Nations should stand on the position of justice, fairness, and its own responsibilities, and effectively sanction Japan's atrocities to maintain the sacred covenant of the international community. ㈣ If the League of Nations cannot impose effective sanctions on Japan's atrocities in accordance with the covenant, then for the sake of survival, our nation will have no choice but to engage in legitimate self-defense and continue resistance, preferring to be shattered jade rather than whole tiles. We sincerely hope that your commission will uphold impartiality, conduct a thorough investigation, so that the violent and greedy can be punished, and public reason and justice can be upheld, then the auspicious omen of East Asian peace will be the gospel of world peace. A telegram is extended, and best wishes for your success are offered. Jointly, the Fujian Provincial Businessmen's Alliance, Education Association, Farmers' Association, Labor Union, Academic Society, and various professional organizations.

<h3>Holding Public Meeting</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The nineteen-member committee of the League of Nations Assembly held its first public meeting today at 3:38 PM. Chairman Hymans stated that he had heard that negotiations on the Shanghai ceasefire and the withdrawal of Japanese troops were underway, and he would ask Japanese representative Sato and Chinese representative Dr. Yen to provide information. Sato rose and stated that the Japanese 11th Division and the Kumamoto Mixed Brigade had received orders to withdraw, so about 14,000 soldiers would return home. Regarding the negotiations, the first meeting was held on March 14th, and he had not yet been ordered to report the details, but what he could say now was that an important step forward had been realized. Sato also said that the Japanese government sincerely hoped to combine the disputes with China and reach a solution. Then Dr. Yen rose and stated that the Chinese government, under the mediation of British Ambassador Lampson, had initiated negotiations and had not agreed to maintain confidentiality, so there was no reason not to publicize the details. Dr. Yen also stated that he had just received a telegram, sent today, stating that because Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu had not yet received instructions from the Japanese government, today's meeting had not been held. Dr. Yen then explained China's opposition to confirming the agreement in the letter from the Shanghai mayor to Japan on January 28th, and the reasons for opposing the inclusion of personnel from neutral countries in the joint committee to monitor all aspects of the troop withdrawal area, until the final solution was agreed upon. Yen said that the mayor's letter concerned finding ways to stop the boycott, so this was a political condition, and the second agreement was also political in nature and violated the resolution of the League of Nations Assembly, because the joint committee was a Sino-Japanese group. To allow the invaders who had already withdrawn to return to monitor everything was unacceptable, he said. Yen also said that ten days had passed without a resolution, so the situation was still fraught with danger. (Reuters dispatch, March 17)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army's Defense Deployment on the Front Line</h3>
<p>With the League of Nations Investigation Commission arriving in Shanghai, the Japanese army outwardly showed a ceasefire and troop withdrawal, but in reality, it was actively preparing for war. Its first line of defense stretched from Huangdu Station eastward through Wangjia Village and Yuan Sidu to the Jiading-Xiangshi Road, then turning north along the stone road through Shigangmen to Jiading City. The north of the city extended north along the Jialou Road to Loutang, about forty li in length. According to Mr. Yin, who escaped from Shigang, this line had been dug into deep, long trenches on the 15th and 16th. About 20,000 troops were stationed along the line, and artillery positions were set up at important locations. In various villages west of Jiading, Japanese scout teams appeared and disappeared unpredictably.</p>
<h3>Actions of Japanese Warships Along the River</h3>
<p>Changshu, March 17, 7:00 PM (special dispatch): Four or five li north of Fuqiao, there are five enemy warships and more than ten small boats measuring the water depth.

<h3>Peace in Taicang</h3>
<p>Taicang residents Wu Shouqi and Rao Weifeng wrote to this newspaper: Dear Sirs, Having read the article in your newspaper on March 11th entitled "Artillery Fire in Kunshan and Taicang," which stated that "Taicang city was bombarded by Japanese artillery and several fires broke out, and residents fled at night," this seems to be inconsistent with the facts. After investigation, two battalions of our troops are stationed in this area, preparing calmly, and the area is generally peaceful. The market has returned to normal, and refugees have also returned home one after another. There is no military conflict. Although the enemy occasionally fires a few shots, it is only a show of force and does not attack us. We are residents of Taicang and dare not fail to report what we know. We would be grateful if your newspaper would disclose this to reassure patriotic comrades concerned about the war in Taicang.</p>

The report that Japanese warships are stationed in the Zhoushan Islands refers to Shengshan Island and other places under the jurisdiction of Su. This is my reply by telegram. Respectfully, Lu Yunshen, County Magistrate of Dinghai.</p>
<h3>A Strong Atmosphere of Peace</h3>
<p>Japanese Government Instructions Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>It is Expected that Talks will Resume Today</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai ceasefire issue, after a two-hour talk last Monday evening, representatives from China, Japan, and related countries reached an understanding at the residence of the British Consul-General. Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi and Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Kui immediately requested instructions from their respective governments. Our government immediately approved and instructed Vice Minister Guo to prepare for negotiations. The Japanese government instructions, which arrived late yesterday, were received by Shigemitsu Kui, who then conferred with Japanese Commander Shirakawa. The content of the Japanese government instructions is unknown, but according to Japanese sources, after the instructions from Tokyo arrived in Shanghai, a strong atmosphere of peace suddenly prevailed in the Japanese military headquarters and consulates. Representatives from China, Japan, and related countries are expected to hold a second round of talks today. Our representative will still be Vice Minister Guo, and the Japanese representatives will be Shigemitsu Kui and Yosuke Matsuoka. Although Shirakawa Yoshinori represents the opinions of the military, he will be consulted behind the scenes but will not attend the meeting. If so, then Jiang Guangnai, Commander-in-Chief of our 19th Route Army, and Dai Ji, Garrison Commander of Songhu, will also agree not to attend, and all negotiations will be handled by diplomats. On the side of the related countries, British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, French Minister Wilden, and Italian Charge d'Affaires Ciano will continue to participate together. Regarding the issue of the League of Nations Investigation Commission's participation, because there were still no instructions from Geneva yesterday, there is no concrete decision yet. Sir Lytton's staff told our reporter last night that if the negotiations between the representatives of China, Japan, and related countries proceed smoothly, then the participation of the Investigation Commission is not very important. According to foreign sources, the understanding reached last Monday was approximately the following three points: ㈠ The Japanese army will withdraw to its original defense before January 28th, and the Chinese army will maintain its current defense line. ㈡ The area evacuated by the Japanese army will be maintained by Chinese police. ㈢ Chinese and Japanese representatives, together with representatives of related countries, will form a committee to monitor the implementation of the above two articles. This understanding was established based on the resolution of the League of Nations Assembly on March 4th. The Japanese government instructions yesterday generally agreed with this understanding, but requested some amendments.</p>
<p>National Crisis Conference</p>
<h3>Discussions on Moving the Conference to Beijing</h3>
<p>Shanghai Members Schedule a Meeting to Discuss Preparations</p>
<p>The government has ordered the National Crisis Conference to be held in Luoyang on April 1st. Yesterday, members from Beijing and Tianjin telegraphed the Shanghai Committee saying: "After discussing together, we feel that the location of the meeting is closely related to the convenience or inconvenience of travel and the number of attendees. Could you please contact the government nearby and hold the meeting in Nanjing? We await your reply." Shanghai members Zhu Qinglan, etc., telegraphed Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan saying: "Members from Beijing and Tianjin have telegraphed requesting that the meeting be moved to Nanjing. We believe that Nanjing is the capital, making transportation more convenient, and being closer to the Shanghai disaster makes observations more relevant. Given these advantages, public opinion strongly favors holding the meeting in Nanjing. We await your telegram." It is unknown how the Executive Yuan will resolve this.</p>
<p>The long-planned National Crisis Conference is said to be held on April 1st. Shanghai members, in order to discuss preparations beforehand, have scheduled a meeting for 2:00 PM on Saturday, March 19th, at the Zhongshe at 150 Weihaiwei Road to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Fire Insurance Companies Study the Issue of Zhabei Compensation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that major fire insurance companies in this city have formed a special committee to consider the issue of compensation for the Zhabei fire, investigate whether the fire was a direct result of the war, and study other related legal issues. It is said that the number of losses is about ten million taels, involving no fewer than 150 foreign fire insurance companies.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Continues to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Warships and Troops Arrive Again in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Large Amounts of Artillery and Ammunition Arrive</p>
<p>While the Japanese army has announced the withdrawal of some ground troops due to the arrival of the League of Nations Investigation Commission in Shanghai, it has secretly deployed reinforcements to Shanghai. Within the past ten days, reinforcements have successively arrived and landed at various places such as Wusong, Zhanghuabang, and Yangshupu, and have been sent to the front and stationed in Songhu and Jiangwan. The number of troops has exceeded the number of troops withdrawn. Here is what we know:</p>
<h3>The 22nd Squadron of Warships Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, four torpedo boats from the Japanese Navy's 22nd Squadron entered Wusong and sailed to the Yangshupu area to anchor. The ships were carrying Japanese troops and a batch of military equipment. At 2:10 PM in the afternoon, another Japanese destroyer from the 2nd Squadron arrived. According to eyewitnesses, the ship was carrying many white bombs and shells, all of which were unloaded on land in the Yangshupu area. The number of Japanese warships in the Huangpu River has also increased since yesterday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Continue to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese transport ship Jia An Maru arrived in Shanghai, and at 11:20 AM, another transport ship, Yamashiro Maru, also arrived from Japan. The two ships carried a total of 1,100-1,200 Japanese troops, as well as many field heavy artillery pieces and a large number of shells, which were transported together. The Japanese soldiers on the two ships were not from the 14th Division and landed in the Yangshupu area. The unloading took place in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Food and Equipment Continue to Arrive from Dalian</h3>
<p>A large amount of military-use japonica rice and equipment from the Japanese army in Guandong have been transferred to Shanghai to supply the Japanese army here. A large amount of military fire has been successively transported here six or seven times. Two more batches were transported on the 16th and 17th. The transportation was quite secretive. The military grain and equipment were unloaded at the Manchukuo Railway pier in the Huangpu Wharf. There were also forty or fifty White Russians who arrived in Shanghai in the past two days, but it is still difficult to determine whether they were hired by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Izumo Flagship on Alert</h3>
<p>The Japanese Navy flagship Izumo, which is docked in front of the Japanese consulate, has been on high alert since it was attacked by a water mine, although it was not damaged. Since yesterday, electric nets have been placed on the river surface outside the ship, and obstacles have been placed around the flagship. A special motorboat is used for patrol. All of the protection around the ship can be seen.</p>
<h3>Situation Reported by Western Newspapers</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that while peace talks are underway, hoping to effectively stop the hostile actions between China and Japan, the Japanese army is still consolidating its position as before. Warships continue to arrive from Japan, and transport ships continue to unload military supplies ashore. If the Japanese warlords intend to reopen the war, these military supplies are sufficient for immediate war. Two destroyers arrived in Shanghai yesterday (16th), and five transport ships arrived on Tuesday, carrying artillery, bullets, grain, etc., which were unloaded at the Lanzhou Port Railway Wharf. At the same time, two destroyers and one cruiser entered the port. More are expected to arrive today (17th). In the past ten days, Japanese transport ships loaded with soldiers, artillery, ammunition, and military supplies have been continuously arriving in Shanghai without interruption. Although the Japanese 9th Division and the 24th Brigade have been ordered to board ships and return home on Friday and Saturday, the 14th Division will complete the handover on the front line before tomorrow. The 14th Division is a wartime formation, and its number is almost twice that of the 9th Division. Yesterday, the Japanese Command also announced that the Japanese army will release a balloon in a certain area near Shanghai in the next few days. This is not an offensive action, but only to scout the Chinese army. It also said that Japan's withdrawal of troops shows that its balloon release is not an offensive action. Another message is that at present, the Japanese army between Jiading and Nanxiang has been releasing balloons into the sky every day. Its intention is obviously to monitor the actions of the Chinese army, but only one balloon has been seen so far.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Discusses Persuading Merchants to Pay Donations</h3>
<p>To Supply Important Needs</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received two letters from the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau stating that since the outbreak of war in the Shanghai North area, residents throughout the city have been alarmed and relocated, and the city's tax revenue has been greatly affected. For more than a month, huge sums of money have been needed for public security, military pay, and refugee relief, all of which have been maintained by the Bureau with great effort and difficulty. No fundraising has been done among local merchants. However, the financial resources of the city treasury are limited, and it is difficult to pay the monthly police pay. Because it is very important for local security, the Bureau has sent personnel to collect house donations in the city to supplement funds. The letter is hereby sent for your information. It is hoped that your Association will uphold the spirit of mutual assistance, persuade all merchants to understand the difficulties of the times, and enthusiastically pay their donations to supply important needs. The Association has received the letter and has sent letters to various trade associations to inform all shops, the Social Bureau, and the vocational community.</p>
<h3>Commercial Ways to Relieve Unemployed Workers</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai war, the number of unemployed workers in the city has increased sharply. According to a recent survey by the Social Bureau, the number of workers in major factories who have been unemployed due to the war has reached as many as 160,000, and the workers in other small factories are not included. At a time when prices are high and life is difficult to sustain, workers in various factories have repeatedly requested relief from the government, but the government's power is limited. Although there are one or two measures, they are of little help. Therefore, a meeting is scheduled for 3:00 PM today at the Chinese Vocational Education Society on Huanlong Road to discuss how to investigate the vacancies in various factories that have already started work, so as to supplement unemployed workers at any time, and other relief issues. The YMCA Vocational Guidance Center, etc., are all among those invited.</p>
<h3>Two Important Messages from the Post Office</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Post Office, the Liuhe, Luodian, and Anting post offices, and the Gujiazai, Liujiahang, [characters missing] Tang, Luduqiao, Jiangqiao, Jiwangmiao, Wai [characters missing], and Fangtai [characters missing] postal agencies have been temporarily closed due to being in the war zone. All mail to these places has also been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>After reopening the North Sichuan Road branch, the Shanghai Postal Administration, in view of the situation there gradually stabilizing, has decided to resume the exchange, savings, and delivery services of the branch from March 17th. All delivery services handled by the branch will also be restored, but if there are mail items that cannot be delivered because the residence is empty, the recipient can directly inquire and collect them from the branch. Also, the exchange and savings services of the Wusong Road branch, which were temporarily moved to the Administration due to the situation, will be moved back to the original branch from March 17th because the market in the area has recovered and traffic is unblocked.</p>
<h3>Notice to Litigants in the War Zone</h3>
<p>Notice from the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court</p>
<p>Those who have moved must report within ten days</p>
<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court issued a notice yesterday stating: "Notice is hereby given that in civil and criminal cases accepted by this court, many plaintiffs and interested parties have moved their residences due to the outbreak of war and have not reported to the court, resulting in documents not being delivered and litigation being hindered. A notice is hereby given to all plaintiffs and interested parties that if they have moved their residences, they must report their current address to the court within ten days from the date of this notice in order to proceed with the litigation. Do not delay."</p>
<h3>Sugar Industry Asks for Improvement of New Tariff Rules</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Industry Association believes that the new tariff rules issued by the Ministry of Finance are harsh and difficult to bear, and has specifically telegraphed to request improvement. The original text is as follows: "To Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, Having read the Jianghai Customs Notice and the decree of the Ministry, it has been decided that the new tariff rules for sugar will be implemented from April 1st, and the polarimetric method will be used as the classification standard. The new tariff rules are now more than double the original tariff rate. Sugar is in fact an essential food for life, and at a time when natural disasters and wars are intertwined, and the sugar industry and people's strength are in decline, how can such a heavy tax be borne by the people? The classification has reached as many as fourteen items, which is complicated and burdensome beyond measure. Looking at the world's sugar tariffs, most East Asian countries still use the Dutch standard for classification and distinction. Our country has been following this for a long time and should temporarily maintain the old rate. Although European and American countries use degrees as the standard, they only divide it into two types: raw materials and products. Even if our country has one type of sugar that is also sold, it may be enough to divide it into three categories. The classification should be based on the following: below 90 degrees as one category, from 91 degrees to 96 degrees as one category, and above 97 degrees as one category. Using this classification as the standard will benefit the country from taxation and will protect the sugar industry and sugar merchants. Also, although imported sugar goods have the same trademark, there are often differences. If the newly defined classification standard is used to distinguish taxation, it is feared that customs officials will find it difficult to measure accurately when measuring, causing sugar merchants to suffer the pain of unwarranted taxes, or even opening up the way for customs officials to seek bribes, which will cause sugar merchants to suffer unexpected damage. Based on the above reasons, it is felt that the newly issued tariff rules are out of touch with commercial conditions and are not appropriate. We hereby telegraph to ask you to consider the people's livelihood, sympathize with the difficulties of merchants, and suspend the implementation of these new rules, which will not benefit the country but will endlessly burden the people, and re-improve them before implementing them. The telegram is urgent. We respectfully ask for your approval. The Shanghai Sugar Industry Association."</p>

<p>The staff and workers of the local Nanhua industry previously organized a consolation group to collect funds to comfort the wounded soldiers in various military hospitals. This was reported in previous issues. It is now known that the group recently received a letter from colleagues and workers in Pudong, stating that the group had not previously solicited donations in Pudong, but the Pudong colleagues love the country and do not want to lag behind others, and now that the League of Nations investigation team is in Shanghai, the public should continue to enthusiastically comfort the wounded soldiers who defended the country, in order to promote the national spirit. Therefore, they requested to send personnel to solicit donations from colleagues in various places in Pudong. The group discussed the matter and considered it feasible, and decided to go to Pudong today to solicit donations and provide immediate comfort.</p>
<h3>Address of the Red Cross Shelter</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, the Chinese Red Cross has established more than 40 military hospitals and 4 refugee shelters. For the convenience of all sectors, the names and addresses of the association's shelters are specially listed below: First Shelter of the Chinese Red Cross, Tanziwan; Second Shelter of the Chinese Red Cross, Qiliu Shelter, Dawang Temple, Xinzha Road; Third Shelter of the Chinese Red Cross, Tianchan Stage, Sima Road; Fourth Shelter of the Chinese Red Cross (Caojia) Ferry (This shelter is divided into five shelters, all located in Caojiadu)</p>
<h3>Newly Established Refugee Shelter</h3>
<p>The 28 refugee shelters established by the Local War Zone Refugee Relief Association are all overcrowded, and some of them have problems. For example, the Great World was originally the 14th shelter of the association, but now the place has resumed business, so it was changed to Xiude Lane, Wuding Road. The 16th shelter was originally in Qitian Dance Hall, which is also the same situation, and was changed to Kangle Lane, Kangnao Road, Caojiadu. This place has the largest houses and can accommodate more than 3,000 refugees. Recently, a new 28th shelter has been established in Fuju Lane, Kangnao Road, Caojiadu. However, the number of refugees coming to Shanghai has been increasing day by day, and all the places are still not enough. It is also heard that there are still as many as 20,000 refugees in the western suburbs of Shanghai, who will come to Shanghai one after another. The association is feeling great difficulty in finding accommodation and is now trying its best to find suitable locations.</p>
<h3>Kunshan Military Hospital Established</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross previously sent a large number of rescue team members to the transportation point in front of our army to negotiate and organize a military hospital in the war zone. The association has now received a telegram from Suzhou, stating that many military hospitals have been organized in the Kunshan area and have been actively engaged in rescue and recuperation work for the wounded soldiers at the front line in recent days.</p>

<h3>Pukou Ferry Has Started Construction in England</h3>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, Mr. Malkang, General Manager of Marconi in Shanghai, stated today (17th) that the railway ferry between Pukou and Xiaguan has started construction at the shipyard of Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson in Newcastle, England. This ferry will transport passenger and freight cars of the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways across the river. It was negotiated by the foreign firm in Shanghai, and after detailed design was drafted, it was sent to London and approved by the British Boxer Indemnity Committee. The ferry will be manufactured to the highest standards, with three tracks on the deck, capable of carrying 1,200 tons, plus one pusher locomotive. If fully loaded, it can carry three locomotives. The ferry is also equipped with life rafts and life belts for 500 people in case of emergency. Steel pontoons will be placed on both banks, and four bridge sections will be built on each, which can be raised and lowered freely to suit the water level.</p>
<h3>Relocation Measures for the Completed Continental Emporium Hospital and Shelter</h3>
<p>The Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road is owned by the Continental Bank and was contracted to be built by Gongji Construction Factory. The reasons for taking back the building this time are: 1) In view of the current situation, there has been a slight turn for the better, and the recovery of the city's commerce is imminent; 2) The construction deadline has arrived, and the handover procedures must be fulfilled; 3) The tenants are about to open their businesses and are eager for internal decoration. Therefore, it is necessary to clean up the building. The follow-up measures are described below: 1) The Women's Military Hospital, located on the fourth and fifth floors of the building, has admitted more than 300 wounded soldiers since March 1. Except for the wounded officers and soldiers who have gradually returned to their units after recovery, there are still 197 people in the hospital for treatment. The hospital decided to move all the wounded soldiers to the Peide School Military Hospital on Datong Road starting from the 14th, because it is not easy to find another hospital site after the building has to be returned. Some 30 doctors and nurses will be sent to Nanjing to work. According to the inquiry, the remaining 30 people will be assigned after the hospital's vice president, Liu Ruiheng, arrives in Shanghai today (18th). As there is no war at present, the hospital affairs will be temporarily closed. 2) The Christian Shelter, located on the second and third floors of the building, was founded by Mr. Li Denghui and others. It has accommodated a total of 1,683 refugees. Except for those who have been sent back to their hometowns, the rest are merged into the second shelter of the church opposite Zhaofeng Garden. 3) The Chamber of Commerce Shelter currently has more than 1,300 refugees. Except for more than 900 people from Jiading, who are responsible for resettlement by the Jiading Association, the remaining 400 people will be given boat tickets and train tickets if there are boats and trains available, and cash will be given to those who cannot travel by boat or train to send them back to their hometowns separately. 4) The Boy Scout Battlefield Service Corps Shelter still has more than 500 refugees, in addition to those who have been sent back and introduced to work. It is said that all the shelters of the corps are overcrowded and cannot be merged, and there is no suitable new site. Therefore, the corps has obtained the consent of the Shanghai Maintenance Association, and the association will find a way to handle it.</p>

Unfortunately, he died on the way, and his old mother and weak wife will return alone, which is even more tragic.</p>

<h3>Case of Privately Organizing Military Organs</h3>
<p>Conclusion of Argument Annulled</p>
<p>Reschedule for Reopening of Argument</p>
<p>Zhang Wuyuan, a native of Shangcheng, Shandong, who lives at 611 Pushi Road, French Concession, claiming to be a military advisor of the 20th Army of Hunan and an advisor of the 20th Army of Sichuan, previously established a recruitment office for the National Defense Army of the People at Room 5, Huadong Apartment, Malong Road, French Concession, to conduct recruitment. The political department of the French Police found out that Zhang had not been formally appointed by the military department of the National Government, privately organized military organs, violated the prohibition order, and violated the regulations of Articles 45 and 137 issued by the French Consul General, which disturbed the public security of the concession. On the morning of the 7th of this month, Chinese and Western detectives rushed to arrest Zhang and his assistants Chen Lü, Teahouse Worker Shi Caigu, Wu Shanqing, and other four people, seized documents, appointment letters, and other exhibits, and took them to the police station, and handed them over to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer Gu Shouxing filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 146 of the Criminal Law, requesting an inquiry. Judge Xiong Huihua and Secretary Tao Shoukan opened a court to hear the case. According to Zhang's confession, he waited for the preparations to be completed and then submitted the report to the 19th Route Army for record and supply, and the expenses are now being paid by himself. The court ordered the argument to be concluded and scheduled to be sentenced on the 17th, ordering Zhang et al. to be released on bail, and those who were not bailed were detained. This was reported in the previous newspaper. Now Zhang was released on bail, and Chen et al. were detained because they were not bailed. The trial judge found that there were still doubts in the case file and needed to be investigated. Yesterday, Judge Xiong opened a court to summon Zhang et al. to the case and announced that the case still needs to be investigated and cannot be decided today. You can quickly submit the appointment letter and other exhibits to the case for review. He also asked where the 20th Army was stationed. Zhang replied that it was in Xinyang. The court ordered to send a telegram to inquire, fearing that it would be difficult to be detailed, and it must be sent to investigate. After the announcement, the court ruled to annul the conclusion of the argument and wait for the rescheduling of the argument. Zhang Wuyuan was released on the original bail, and Shi Caigu and Wu Shanqing were still detained.</p>
<h3>Power Outage in the Public Concession Temporarily Fixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday (17th) at 4:45 pm, the generator of the Public Concession Power Company was damaged due to a water tank failure, which caused the generator to malfunction, and the power was immediately cut off. All the electric lights in the concession were turned off, and the trams and trolleybuses suddenly stopped running. At that time, it was the time when the offices stopped working, so the cars were crowded and the road was blocked. It was not until 5:15 pm that the original state was restored. It is reported that the company felt very sorry for this incident. Fortunately, it was still daytime at that time, and this kind of thing is extremely rare, so the public may not be inconvenienced too much.</p>
<h3>Western Football Association Announces that All First Division Championship Games are Cancelled</h3>
<p>Important Cup Games Postponed to the Beginning of Next Month</p>
<p>Or the Start of the Second Half of the Season</p>
<p>There is also a Proposal to Divide the Silver Cup Equally</p>
<p>After the Western Football Association announced the continuation of the competition last Saturday, it originally hoped that the situation would be better this week so that the important games could be concluded. Although the atmosphere has eased, the environment is still not conducive to continuing the competition. Therefore, the association announced yesterday that it has decided to cancel the First Division Championship first. As for the important cup games, 1) the Scott Cup has reached the final stage, with the Western Police versus Donghua; 2) the Lincoln team has won the right to the final in the Senior Cup, and Donghua and the Western Police have won the right to the semi-final. The semi-final and final of this item will be postponed to the beginning of next month. If the situation permits, it will be concluded, otherwise, it will have to be canceled or postponed to the start of the second half of the football season. Some people also advocate that if it cannot be held, it may be better to divide the championship equally, and Donghua and the Western Police will each get the Scott Cup, and the Senior Cup will be divided equally by Donghua, Lincoln, and the Western Police. However, the above statement has not been accepted by the association. As for the International Cup, which has not been started at all, it is even less likely to be held.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Glock Road</h3>
<p>At 8:01 am yesterday, five bandits suddenly came to the home of Zhu Fengxiang, a resident of 135 Jixiang Lane, Glock Road, French Concession, and showed their pistols to intimidate and prohibit any sound. They ransacked the house and searched almost everything. After about 20 minutes, they each escaped with their loot. Afterwards, the victim checked the loss in detail and found that clothing and silver dollars worth about 1,200 yuan were robbed. He immediately issued a loss list and reported it to the Songshan Road Police Station for investigation.</p>
<p>The Robbers Fled in a Rented Car After the Robbery</p>
<h3>Although the Car Was Recovered, the Robbers Were Gone</h3>
<p>Six bandits, dressed in different clothes and speaking in a Jiangbei accent, suddenly came to the home of local merchant Hu Maogou at 37 Haige Lane, Haige Road, French Concession, and broke into the inner room on the pretext of questioning. Each thief was holding a pistol and drove all the people in the house into one room, and searched everywhere separately. After about 25 minutes, they each came out with their loot. Unexpectedly, after the bandits left the house, they ran west into Yaozhu Road and pretended to be customers to rent a car from the Asia Automobile Company there. At that time, the car drivers of the company were all hired out, so the owner Liu Guisheng drove a No. 12233 (Municipal No. 736) sedan himself for business. The six robbers got into the car together and ordered it to drive straight west. Unexpectedly, less than 10 minutes after the car left, the victim Hu Maogou had followed and asked the car company if they had seen six robbers pass by. After the company asked about the appearance and clothing of the six people, they realized that the six people who had rented the car were the robbers. Hu urgently used the company's telephone to notify the Songshan Road and Ziminzhong police stations, requesting attention to intercept. The police chief heard the report and immediately sent a large number of detectives to search everywhere. Unexpectedly, they found the car at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue de Verdun, but the six robbers were gone except for the driver Liu Guisheng in the car. The detectives took Liu to the police station and questioned him in detail. According to the confession, the car drove straight west from Avenue Joffre. When it arrived at the residence of Xue Baorun, a giant businessman on Avenue Albert, the car stopped for a short time, and one person jumped out, and then continued westward. When it reached Rue de Verdun, the other five people got out of the car together and went their separate ways. During the interrogation, the victim had arrived afterwards. According to the statistics, the loss was about 1,300 to 1,400 yuan, mostly gold jewelry and banknotes. After the police chief finished questioning, he said that the case was related to robbery and would be verified after investigation.</p>

<h3>The Bid Price is Strong Again by More Than Nine Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market situation was quite improved, and it was nimble and orderly. However, at the beginning, the silver price was flat due to the fall of the big silver bar, so it appeared soft. Afterwards, the drafts did not move clearly, but the trend was firm, and a certain bank widely purchased them and entered spot goods. Therefore, the buying intention of the industry was also strong, and the state suddenly became good, and it rose straight to nine taels, already more than 670 taels. However, there were several taels of hovering, and finally it rose again by more than nine taels. The transactions of each number were slightly better than last week. However, it is feared that the market will not be able to return to its old view for a while. At 9:30, the opening price of May was slightly less than 3 qian, at 663.5 taels. Although the big silver bar continued to fall by one-eighth, the American silver was as before, and the first order was not to move the price. Then, because Yifeng, Yongyuantai, etc. bought in, it immediately added 4.5 taels, at 68 taels. However, there were not a few who shipped out, and it fell back to 66.5 taels. Soon after, Hengxing, Zhenchang, Xiangyuhe, etc. came in, and it was heard that their bank bought more than 400 spot bars, which caused the price to rise by more than 4 taels, to 71 taels at 9:50. However, the American gold was exchanged by Zhejiang, Hefeng, Zhongfu, etc. in June at 33.25 yuan. Then, Shanghai issued April at 33 yuan. Later, because another household and Longsheng, etc. sold it, it fell by 4 taels in just 7 or 8 minutes, to about 67 taels at 10 o'clock. In a moment, it was heard that a certain bank started to drag in, which was purchased by Hengxing, Da Yuantai, etc., so that each number followed, and the shorts urgently made up, and the market situation was good, rising more than 7 taels. However, there were more than 2 taels of ups and downs in half an hour. After 10:30, Hengyu, Hongkang, and Yong also entered, and it reached 74 taels and 9 qian until 10:50. Goods and scattered households sold out, so it was reduced by more than 3 taels to 71.5 taels at 11:15. After entering, the exchange market was stable, but the trading was very quiet. Yifeng, Yonghengxing, and a certain bank continued to compete for purchases on the table, so the market price was 4 taels more, and reached 76 taels at 11:30. Then, the British gold recently settled at 9 shillings, 875 points, and the distant period was 6875.5 points. Furthermore, because Wanxing and others sold it, it fell sharply by more than 3 taels, to 72.5 taels, and immediately went back to 1 tael. However, all parties were sporadically paying in and out, and the market closed at 73 taels at noon, which was 9 taels and 2 qian higher than the afternoon of the previous day. It was found that the maximum was 76 taels in the morning, and the minimum was 13 taels and 5. There was a review of 12.5 qian, and the opening price was still 733 taels. The count was 70 taels, and then 578 taels. As a result, 60 taels, which was 9 taels less than the previous day. The account was registered at 66 taels in March, 67 taels in April, 73 taels in May, and 66 taels in the supplementary water. The red bar was reduced by 4 taels at the market price due to the trend of raising the interest rate when dropping the period.</p>
<h3>The Big Silver Bar Continued to Shrink by 125</h3>
<p>According to the London telegram on the 16th, the big silver bar continued to shrink by 125 points, the recent period was 18 shillings and 125 points, the distant period was 18 shillings and 25 points, and there were few sales in China. The market was flat, and there was not much change after the market closed.

<h3>The Situation in Shenyang is Tense</h3>
<p>Volunteer Armies Attack in Three Routes</p>
<p>Japanese Army Rapidly Concentrates in Xinmin</p>
<p>(Beiping) News from Shenyang: Due to the large-scale mobilization of volunteer armies in western Liaoning, Honjo urgently telegraphed to the Japanese army stationed in Heilongjiang and Jilin to rapidly concentrate in Xinmin. Volunteer armies are quite active in the four suburban areas of Shenyang and plan to attack the city. The Japanese army stationed in Shenyang has only two regiments. The volunteer armies plan to take advantage of the situation to attack Shenyang in three routes, with a total of tens of thousands of troops. One route will attack Xinmin from Jin County, the second route will attack Yingkou from Goubangzi, and the third route will depart from Zhangwu, Faku, and Kangping, advancing in separate routes. Most of the puppet national flags hung outside the passes have been removed by the volunteer armies and replaced with the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. Shenyang is under curfew for the fourteenth time, with pedestrians being inspected. (Seventeenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When the volunteer armies attacked the city on the tenth, many citizens in the city followed and withdrew. Wang Tongxuan, the head of the merchant guild, forced the militia to attack the volunteer armies. One volunteer army soldier was captured. On the morning of the eleventh, the police forced various businesses to open and hang puppet flags. At that time, rumors spread everywhere, and people were panicking. Jin Shanhao, the seventh captain of the Northeast Border Defense United National Salvation Army, died in battle when attacking the city on the tenth. The Japanese side examined the body on the eleventh. The volunteer armies killed several Japanese soldiers, captured more than ten, seized more than thirty rifles, four machine guns, three trucks, one car, and two electric bicycles.

The attacking army used heavy artillery in the battle. Botuna, also known as Xincheng, is a prosperous commercial center on the right bank of the Songhua River.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese newspaper reported that regarding the Sino-Eastern Railway issue, the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the Manchurian state, but internal strife among the figures in the new state is fierce, and the situation is serious.

Zang Shiyi accused Xi Qia of being incompetent and unable to head the Ministry of Finance, and should request to resign. After the mutiny of the Chinese army in Daheihe and Manzhouli, Bayan, seventy li northeast of Harbin, also experienced disturbances. If Ma Zhanshan does not resign, the situation seems likely to escalate. Honjo Shigeru inspected northern Manchuria and met with Ma Zhanshan yesterday, which is of great importance to the outside world.

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Intensification of the Political Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>Heavy Economic and Social Difficulties</p>
<p>Seiyukai Cabinet Feels It Is Thorny</p>
<p>Reactionary Elements Active Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>Party Rule Has Lost National Faith</p>
<h3>Special Parliament Opens Today</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 17th: The development of the political situation in Japan is causing great concern. Although rumors are rife and the truth is difficult to discern, there is no doubt that the country is currently encountering a major economic, political, and social crisis. Today, sources from well-informed circles expressed their opinions that although the Seiyukai cabinet won a majority in the recent elections, it now feels unable to overcome this difficulty. There is currently a political movement behind the scenes attempting to organize a strong national "supra-party" government. If this move cannot be completed quickly, it is feared that the military will be forced to temporarily seize national power in order to eliminate the fierce reactionary movement. This movement is now growing in strength and may lead to major riots, which may lead to a large-scale mutiny. Although the reactionaries are loyal to the imperial family, they seem to have a definite anti-capitalist tendency. The reasons for this are very complex, but the main ones are: (1) Loss of credibility of party rule; (2) Economic difficulties, especially in rural areas; (3) Enthusiastic but distorted patriotism and nationalism, which have become more intense since various countries recently criticized Japan's actions towards China. At present, the military seems to be quite sympathetic to this movement. The National Reserve Soldiers Association is clearly one of the strongest supporters. However, there is reason to believe that the military authorities have recognized the need to curb this move before it becomes unmanageable.</p>
<p>Japanese Alliance, Tokyo, 17th: The temporary parliament, which will discuss important issues such as military spending in Shanghai and Manchuria and the suspension of the gold standard, will open tomorrow. The ruling Seiyukai party and the opposition Minseito party each held joint meetings of members of parliament and councilors this afternoon to discuss the policy to deal with the parliament. It is reported that the parliament's agenda is as follows: the parliament will open on the 18th to elect the speaker and deputy speaker; the House of Representatives will be established on the 19th; the opening ceremony will be held in the House of Peers at 11:00 AM on the 20th; the session will be adjourned on the 21st; the House of Representatives and various committees will meet on the 22nd to submit various bills; the bills will be discussed on the 23rd; all bills can be passed on the 24th; and the closing ceremony will be held at 11:00 AM on the 25th.</p>
<p>Japanese Alliance, Tokyo, 17th: Foreign Minister Yoshizawa will give a speech at the temporary parliament on the diplomatic process of the Shanghai and Manchuria cases. Reuters, Tokyo, 17th: The supplementary budget bill for the dispatch of troops to Shanghai and Manchuria will be submitted when the special meeting of the parliament opens tomorrow. The bill is for 67.5 million yuan, of which 750,000 yuan will be offset within this fiscal year, and the remainder will be allocated within the fiscal year starting on April 1. Another case of the government raising 67.5 million yuan in debt will also be submitted to the parliament, which is also a retroactive recognition, as the money has already been allocated from the imperial treasury.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Japanese Blood Pledge Corps</h3>
<p>Angered by Political Corruption, Seeking Reform</p>
<p>Dedicated to Assassinating Political and Financial Tycoons</p>
<p>Keio University Students with Left-Leaning Ideologies</p>
<p>Japanese Alliance, Tokyo, 17th: The Blood Pledge Assassination Corps is currently being interrogated by the prosecutor's office. The masterminds of the corps are Inoue Nissho and Furuchihojo. Onuma, Kurosawa, Hishinuma, Tanaka, etc. are the vanguard. The famous national scholar Gondo Seikyo is also the supporter. He promoted the ideology of the Three Kingdoms History to the members of the Blood Pledge Corps. Onuma, Hishinuma, etc. believed that the current state of corruption was caused by political figures and zaibatsu. Therefore, they planned to overthrow the political parties and zaibatsu in order to realize the Showa Restoration. They attempted to assassinate Wakatsuki, Tokonami, and Go Seinosuke, and then assassinate a certain right-wing party leader.</p>
<p>Japanese Alliance, Tokyo, 17th: The Metropolitan Police Department learned that there was a Communist Party organization within Keio University. Since February of this year, they have arrested more than a dozen students from the Department of Economics, including Fujita, Okayama, and Kojima.

<p>British Liberal Party Leader</p>
<h3>Praises Our Army's Bravery</h3>
<p>Criticizing the Government's Far East Policy</p>
<p>Saying that Being Indecisive and Cowardly Damages the Dignity of the League of Nations</p>
<p>National, London, 16th: Lloyd George, the famous leader of the British Liberal Party, has returned to active political life. In a speech at the Steedminges Hall today, he severely criticized the government's protection policy, disarmament policy, and Far East policy. When George claimed that our country in the Far East could be described as suspicious, weak, and cowardly, and that the British government's hesitation and indecision in its Far East policy had greatly damaged the dignity of the League of Nations, and that our only hope rested on the brave resistance of the Chinese army with its dilapidated armaments, the audience applauded and cheered, shaking the hall.

<h3>Bitterly Criticizes Japanese Militarism</h3>
<p>Unjust Aggression Cannot Be Punished</p>
<p>Will Damage International Morality</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 17th: Le Travail publishes Lord Cecil's criticism of Japan's actions in Shanghai, saying that if the future solution does not punish unjust aggression, does not refute militarism, and does not guarantee that the members of the League of Nations who are loyal will receive compensation for the harm they have suffered, it will inflict a harmful blow to international morality. It cannot be considered justified for Japan to bombard and occupy Chinese territory without attempting to achieve its demands through mediation and arbitration. The League of Nations and the United States must now refuse to forgive, and must formally and publicly condemn the barbaric actions of the Japanese military authorities. If the aggressor makes a truce impossible and refuses a neutral zone, the League of Nations Council should ask its member states to apply diplomatic and economic pressure to the powers that violate the League of Nations Charter, and should formally invite the United States to cooperate.</p>
<p>The United States Has Always Stated</p>
<h3>Respect for the Nine-Power Treaty</h3>
<p>Signatory Countries Recognizing the Manchurian Puppet Government</p>
<p>Is Equivalent to Undermining China's Territorial Integrity</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 17th: The New York Times' Washington correspondent states that the new Manchurian state's request for recognition from various countries means that the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteed the territorial and administrative integrity of China. The United States has always regarded Manchuria as a part of China. If any signatory country of the Nine-Power Treaty recognizes the new Manchurian government, the United States will obviously ask it to pay special attention to the treaty, even Japan. However, Japan has not yet made a special announcement regarding its intention in this matter, and none of the other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty has expressed that it is currently considering the issue of recognizing the new Manchurian state.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 16th: The Foreign Office recently received a document from the Foreign Minister of the new Manchurian state requesting the establishment of diplomatic relations. British officials stated that Britain cannot decide now and should consider how other countries that have received the same request and the League of Nations Council will act, what the results of the Shanghai Round Table Conference will be, and what conclusions the League of Nations Investigation Team will draw before deciding on the attitude to be taken.</p>
<p>The United States Agrees</p>
<h3>To Ban the Export of Munitions</h3>
<p>Will Instruct Disarmament Representatives</p>

<h3>Economic League Plan</h3>
<p>Taittinger Negotiates with Representatives of Various Countries</p>
<p>German Response Delivered to French Embassy</p>
<p>Geneva, 16th (Kuomintang Telegram) – Although the Disarmament Conference adjourned today, French Premier Taittinger remains here to discuss the Danube Economic League plan and will return home at the end of the week.</p>
<p>This plan has become the focal point of current discussion and will be a major issue attracting attention in the coming weeks. Taittinger met with Italian representative Micheli for a long time this afternoon. Afterwards, Micheli returned to Rome to report to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. It is said that France and Italy will continue discussions in Paris next week. Taittinger is scheduled to meet with German economic expert Boss tomorrow. Boss is a key member of the German delegation and has reportedly held preliminary discussions with representatives from Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The proposal for a joint meeting of the five Danube countries and major powers is said to be opposed by Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, who advocates excluding the major powers. However, Britain and Germany insist on participating and demand that the meeting be convened in Geneva, disagreeing with Beneš's proposal to convene it in Budapest, Hungary, or Belgrade, Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Kuomintang Telegram) – Germany's response to France's Danube Economic League plan was delivered to the French ambassador today. The response argues that only a preferential tariff system linked to industrial countries can alleviate the difficulties of the Danube states. Only by making it easier for these states to sell their agricultural products in industrial countries can immediate relief be provided. As for other plans, they will take at least six months to materialize, and how can a fish in distress wait? If the Danube countries negotiate with each other first, none of them will be a suitable market for the agricultural products of other countries, which is like climbing a tree to catch a fish, what good will it do? Finally, it also proposes including Bulgaria in the league, as it is also a poor country along the Danube River, while Czechoslovakia should not be included.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japanese Tram Strike</h3>
<p>In Response to Dismissal of Employees Drafted into Military Service</p>
<p>Likely to Spread to Major Cities Nationwide</p>
<p>Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reports that the Yokohama Municipal Tram Bureau's implementation of staff reductions due to budget cuts has led to a general tram strike. The Republic Association, organized by the striking workers, has worsened the situation following instructions from the General Federation of Transportation. The Kanagawa Prefecture Police, detecting the activities of members of the National Labor Association, ordered a general mobilization of officers in Yokohama City at dawn on the 12th, arresting all radical elements among the executives of each branch, including Chairman Yamanaka. Unexpectedly, the Tokyo Transportation Labor Union, upon hearing the news, echoed the support, immediately forming a struggle committee and resolving to support the Yokohama workers. Fortunately, timely suppression by various parties prevented a major incident. However, this incident is bound to affect major cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, and Nagoya, so secret orders have been issued to the relevant prefectures to take special measures.</p>
<p>Tokyo Hochi Shimbun received a call from Yokohama stating that the Tokyo headquarters of the General Federation of Transportation Labor will decide, after receiving a response from the Yokohama Municipal Tram Bureau on the 14th, to contact colleagues in the three major cities of Tokyo, Osaka, and Kobe to prepare for a general strike. Yamanaka, an executive of the Tokyo Transportation Labor Union, has gone to Osaka to negotiate, putting forward four demands: opposition to the dismissal of those drafted into military service for the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents, guarantees of livelihood for the families of those drafted, and promotions for those who return to their positions, etc., with a deadline of the 16th for a clear response. If there is no satisfactory answer, they are determined to implement a general strike.</p>

<h3>Large Number of Traitors Arrested</h3>
<p>Several Cases Uncovered in Wuxi</p>
<p>Zhou Qingzhen Arrested in Gaoyou</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: In the past half-month, many Jiangbei barges have come to Wuxi from Shanghai and other places, all heading towards Jiangyin. The public security authorities, fearing that traitors might be mixed in with the inland, have specially joined forces with the merchant corps, army, defense corps, and water police to conduct thorough searches, which have uncovered several cases: (1) The 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Garrison in Wuxi arrested 11 people, including Wang Ziyu from Funing, at the No. 168 railway bridge, and also found an ordinary grenade along the way, which was handed over to the camp headquarters for investigation. (2) The 4th Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside the West Gate seized a barge, capturing five suspected traitors: Xu Linquan, Xu Jinsheng, Xu Desheng, Zhang Zhesheng, and Xu Xiangyang, and found a "Great Japan Meiji 8th Year" silver coin, several Guangxu coins, and a Hong Kong silver coin on their persons, which were transferred by the Public Security Bureau to the county government for interrogation. (3) The 3rd Branch of the Public Security Bureau arrested three people, including Chen Ronggen, at the No. 6 workshop in Yangyaowan, South Gate, and seized a large number of fur coats and gold ornaments, as well as Guangxu and Guangwu coins, which were sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. (4) The 1st Branch of the Public Security Bureau arrested five vagrants, who were transferred by the County Public Security Bureau to the Garrison Camp Headquarters for investigation. It is also heard that the vagrants were involved in gang-raping boatwomen from Jiangbei. (5) The 10th Detachment of the Merchant Corps seized a barge in the Jiangjian River and found opium, red pills, banknotes, and other items, which were transferred to the County Court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Gaoyou Correspondence: Li Wei, the director of the 1st Branch of the County Public Security Bureau, arrested a middle-aged man with strange clothing in Zhongshikou yesterday (the 12th) and immediately took him to the bureau for preliminary interrogation. According to his confession, his name is Zhou Qingzhen, also known as Zhou Dagouzi, a native of this county, and he is the chief of staff of the National Salvation Volunteer Army. The army has more than 100,000 men in the area bordering Jiangsu and Shandong provinces and will soon pass through Gaoyou to the south to participate in the war in Shanghai. He then confessed that he was in fact bought by the Japanese side. Director Li considered the case to be very serious and immediately transferred it to the county government. Judge Jiang opened a court session for interrogation. According to his confession, last year he participated in the robbery of Chen Liangguang's home in the 5th General, 6th Li, along with others, and absconded with the loot. Judge Jiang immediately ordered the co-conspirator, Xia Hengyi, to be brought to court for questioning, and his confession was the same. After the interrogation, he ordered that the two criminals be detained first, pending further investigation and processing.</p>
