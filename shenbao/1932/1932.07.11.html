<h3 id="c1">洛桑公約之效果　華· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>歷時二十餘日經過無數周折之洛桑會議。卒賴英相麥唐納等堅苦卓絕之精神與努力。於九日由參加會議之各國代表簽定公約而蕆事矣。就洛桑公約之内容觀之。吾人誠不能不承認會議之結果。確有相對的成功。足於歐洲諸國間國際政治之穏定。發生若干良好之影響。蓋該約雖未必即能發生一般預期之效果。然二十餘年來經四十次國際會議不能解决之德國賠償問題。至今日而得一相當之解决。援助奥國之計畫。比英德法意五國亦允進行。此於緩和中歐西歐南歐各國向來緊張之情况。頗多裨益也。約中又有政治附件。規定簽約各國。爲維持政治與經濟方面之平和計。今後應禁止重用干戈。或任何方式之武力。此項附件。措辭雖殊含混。對於歐洲平和空氣之增進。至少在目前。亦未必無良好之影響。</p>
<p>語云。（飢者易爲食。渴者易爲飲。）目今經濟恐慌。遍及各國。資本主義之破綻。層出不窮。各國利害關係之對立與衝突。又日益尖銳。而洛桑公約。居然告成。頓使歐洲大陸各方面緊張之情况。煩悶愁苦之人心。得以稍稍解放。歐美各國政府當局。對於議會之結果。一致表示歡欣。額手相慶。此乃人之恒情。無足爲怪。然吾人細察世界與歐洲問題。前途荆棘。槪未掃除。對於洛桑會議之成功。却未敢遽作逾量之估價。</p>
<p>他姑不論。僅就洛桑公約之本身言。德法兩國對之。仍多不平不滿之聲。就德國方面而論。賠償責任。固己减輕。然消息傳來。柏林報紙。大都抨擊公約。對於巴本總理。深爲不滿。蓋在會議中。德國旣未貫澈其軍備均等之主張。又未取消和約上大戰戎首之條欵。結果反允付三十萬萬馬克。寳爲一般德人所深惡痛絕者也。德法雙方。得失相反。　人之所失。即法人之所得。然法人則大都謂此次會議。法國犧牲多而無所獲。是法人亦不滿於會議之結果也。德法雙方。仍多隔膜。公約縱有促進兩國合作之實效。其實效寗能不打若干折扣耶。</p>
<p>抑洛桑公約之效果。又間接直接繫於美國對於歐洲戰債之態度。美國之態度如何。吾人亦不可不加以深察。就表面言之。美國對於洛桑會議之結果。已表示欣悅。允許考慮戰債債額之改訂。洵爲歐洲諸國之好消息。但華盛頓方面。同時嘗有警告。傳達洛桑。謂就策略而論。歐洲債務國如在本年十一月美國選舉總統以前。遽將减輕債務問題。商諸美國。實屬不智。因於此時商請美國减輕債務國負擔。將使美國國會及全國國民增加其反對整理債務之情緒。又美國著名銀行家。對洛桑會議之結果。視爲袪除全世界復原重大障碾之一。惟將來是否足使世界商業凋敝因此轉機。則尚未敢輕發樂觀之預料。由此言之。足見洛桑會議之結果。能否挽回世界經濟恐慌。尚屬難言。縱有效果。亦不能即時實現。</p>
<p>更就洛桑公約中之宣言觀之。增進世界與歐洲之平和。爲各簽字國一致之願望。顧此願望能否達到。則與（軍縮）亦有密切之關係。英相麥氏在會議結束時所致率直之詞。中有言曰。</p>
<p>（·····在此間簽字之協定與條約。必須有他處之回應。余之希望。乃在日内瓦告成大功（指軍縮會議。）而終止濫費金錢於軍備。惟軍縮迄今尚未成功。吾人在各國間必須具有勇氣與信任。及行道德的軍縮······欲達此目的。吾人東方之友。必須加入。（語時面向日代表團。）日本必須加入並對國聯表示忠誠。同於他國。······）</p>
<p>此種和平之願望。誠爲洛桑會議高遠之精神。惟歐美軍締前途。障礙重疊。豈易拔除。且英相麥氏在洛桑會議述其平和願望之日。適值日本陸相荒本。對國聯調查團表示决意承認僞國拒絕第三者干涉之時。遥遥相對。背道而馳。試問洛桑公約表示之平和願望。將何由得達。</p>
<p>洛桑公約之效果。固不能令人無疑。惟歐洲國際政治緊張之情况。得由洛桑公約之簽字而暫時緩和。似亦不容否認。歐洲國際情况。倘在最近將來能稍穏定。則歐洲列强爲維護其資本主義與帝國主義計。勢必整其反俄之陣綫。且更注意於東方之權益。日本欲貫澈其亞洲孟羅主義之雄心。而懼西方之干涉。必有種種適應現况之對策。以對付中國與歐美列强。吾政府與名流。若不深加體察。抱定獨立自主。對外不屈之精神。盡其應盡之責任。竊恐歐洲國際政局。或得暫時稍稍安定。而東方局勢。在最近期間。反愈益糾紛而不可收拾。</p>

<p>▲哈瓦斯九日日内瓦電英美法三國代表團、及其他各代表團間之非正式談判、仍積極進行、其所談判者、爲關於軍縮之决議草案、此項草案通過之後、則軍縮會議第一階叚、即行結束、昨日法國代表團、曾與小協約國及波蘭代表會談兩點鐘之久、此項談話、全以西門所擬之計畫爲根據、但西門計畫、並未十分確定、據民族日報所載、此項計畫、包含</p>
<p>序言　　叙述國聯盟約之第八條、及由巴黎非戰公約發生之義務、曁胡佛之提議、此項計畫、在原則上己由大會全體承認、至于籌備軍縮委員會所擬之公約草案、與同一委員會所通過關於原則之决議案、以及胡佛主張之辦法、亦均在序言中叙及之、序言中復說明大會之任務、在於盡力縮减軍備以完成第一步之緊要工作、但當遵照各種軍備、互相關聯之原則、大會之目的、在於限制攻擊之力量、而維持必不可少之防禦力量、</p>

<h3 id="c71">德債權國 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>簽定君子恊定</p>
<p>須先解决自身債務</p>
<p>始能批准對德條約</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯九日洛桑電照今晨簽字之（紳士協定）、各債權國相約必待伊等本身債務亦得滿意解决之後、始批准其與德國所訂之洛桑條約、以故在紳士恊定中特别聲明、如能得到滿意之解决、則實行其對德條約、否則不予批准、此外又特别訂明新產生之局面旣如此、故債權國彼此如何行動、應互相商洽、如此則各債權國法律地位、恰與胡佛延付戰債以前之情形相同、</p>
<h3 id="c72">美不贊成取銷戰債 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>但認爲確有整理必要</p>
<p>▲國民社九日華盛頓電美國務院今日論洛桑之解决賠欵、在安定歐洲經濟局勢上、可謂己前進一大步、但同時聲稱、美政府態度繼續反對取銷戰債、謂美政府聞洛桑協定之成立、深爲欣慰、但覺美國態度前經胡佛總統於一九三一年六月二十日宣言中明白宣稱、不贊成取銷戰債、因認此種債務之解决、應以債務人在平常狀况下之付欵能力爲根據、但對於現有之非常狀態、應即加以考慮云云、斯時似尚未便更變云、</p>
<h3 id="c73">德國對賠欵會滿意 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>▲國民社九日柏林電德總理巴本及赴洛桑會議之其他代表、已定於明日下午返德、而巴本則已召集星期一之國務會議、届時對於洛桑會議之經過、當有一番報告、自洛桑會議告終後、德國國内各界俱感興奮、此問題遂爲目前討論之焦點、國民社代表曾訪問柏林財政界之領袖恟人、彼輩對於此次賠欵會議之結果、俱表示極端之滿意、因此後德國所担負之支出數目、已减至原有數目十分之一、再則以前所加諸德國國家銀行及國有鐵道等束縛、今已悉數解除、故尤足欣賀也、至於德國輿論界對於此次賠欵會議之結果、據政界中人稱、德國現離國會選舉之期日近、而輿論界不免時時爲内部政治關係之牽連、而作種種過甚之批評、尤以左右極端派之各機關爲甚、故一俟選舉期過、恐即現在極端攻訐巴黎之右派報紙、亦將更改其態度、而承認洛桑會議之成功、故洛桑條約之將爲下届新國會批准、實覺毫無疑義也、再則根據各極端派之觀察、德國此後雖尚有三十萬萬馬克之担負、而能將此種久遠之供奉早日勾銷、已足爲國家之福、如伏錫志報稱、洛桑會議告終、即各國放棄其對於德國經濟上不平等待遇之末日、而不平等經濟待遇、旣屬世界普遍經濟戰爭之造因、則今日之後、世界或將重見復興之現象云、保守黨報紙柏林波森報則十分稱頌巴本氏之要求在軍縮方面與各國完全平等待遇、及取消凡爾賽條約所載戎首條欵、最後稱、德國雖尚有重大之担負、但一思自由權之卒能恢復、猶可差强自慰也云云、</p>
<h3 id="c74">洛桑由熱閙趨冷寂 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>

<h3 id="c75">經濟會議召集日期 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>待國聯開會决定</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯九日日内瓦電　赫禮歐傍晚乘汽車往距日内瓦十二啓羅之哥卜地方、訪問美代表吉白生、據外間推測、赫禮歐似欲於遄返巴黎之前、與吉白生談論軍縮會議之狀况並與英代表團磋商西門所擬結束日内瓦軍縮會議第一段落之决議案云、又實行洛桑會議議决事項各項手續、頗與國聯有關、故一俟洛桑會議主席、將洛桑條約正式通知國聯之後、則國聯行政院、即將於星期二或星期三召集緊急會議、依照洛桑會議之意見、指定委員會、籌備經濟與財政會議、决定該會開會期間與地點、並指定該會主席、英國代表希望該會於十一二月間開會、因主席定將屬麥唐納、開會地點、在日内瓦之希望少、而在倫敦之希望多也、日前開會時、即己討論此事、如該會决在倫敦開會、則國聯行政部及專門部將移往倫敦、國聯副秘書長亞威諾、並將於開會期間、與一部分議員留駐倫敦、此項準備、亦有許多困難之點、萬一經濟會議與日内瓦軍縮會議之工作同時舉行、則將顧此失彼也、又原定九月五日開會之國聯會體大會、亦將延至二十六日開會、</p>
<h3 id="c76">滿鐵總裁問題 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>

<p>岸本無端革職</p>
<p>痛斥拓相寡恥</p>
<p>▲華聯社十日東京電滿鐵後任總裁、永井拓相推薦　原繼任、事雖垂成、但被荒木陸相反對、况永井無端罷免岸本樺太長官、政友會早因洩憤無路、今得口實、乃鳴鼓而攻之、被革職之岸本長官、今日亦對永井拓相發公開文書、大興問罪之師、痛駡永井私心無恥、齋藤首相又爲人事問題、閙到頭顾顱幾乎欲破、</p>

<p>▲電通社十日東京電渡滿中之眞崎參謀次長、今晨由大連塔烏拉爾丸抵門司、謂在由錦州歸瀋途中、　遇義軍、但即　日軍擊退、至於承認滿洲國事、因國内分急進論與尚早論二說、孰是孰否、不能言之、或謂在滿兵數過多、或謂兵力不足、此皆見解之誤、故須進京後與各方協議、方能决定、</p>
<p>▲電通社十日漢城電字垣朝鮮總督今日上午十時此城出發、十四日可抵東京、</p>
<h3 id="c78">日民衆捐資造飛機 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>

<p>▲華聯十日東京電　日本財政部爲欲補救財政上之不敷、主計司及租稅司計劃增收稅金、而高橋藏相謂市面景况依然蕭條、不堪重稅、主張照舊發公債維持、日財政上之困難、能否解决、甚堪注目、</p>
<p>▲電通社十日東京電日政府財政依然困難、赤字公債之發行、明年度勢必實行、由此推之、則赤字公債之利息、或不能不以公債補之、大藏省事務局爲編列來年度之預算、開始調查再增稅或創設新稅案、新稅與增稅之大綱如下、（一）現行百分之二元資本利息稅、增爲百分之四、（一）存欵部之利息、作爲第二種所得、爲總合課稅、（一）特别賞與·紀念賞與·退職金等、作爲第三種所得、爲總合課稅（一）增加第三種所得稅之累進率、（一）增加承繼稅之稅率、（一）創設汽油稅奢侈稅、但高橋藏相自就任以來、再三聲明今非增稅之時、故贊成否尙屬疑問、但鑑於目下之狀况、勢必實行也、</p>

<p>▲路透社九日華盛頓電參院今日通過折衷案、規定撥二十一萬二千二百萬元之鉅欵、爲失業救濟經費、此案現將送交胡佛總統、衆料白宫或將否决之、因胡佛總統與財長皆反對此案也、此案原稿、曾引起許多方面之攻擊、故大加修改、因是之故、此案乃名折衷案、</p>

<h3 id="c96">關於暑期作業　亞· <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>暑假是學生的黄金時期、在這個時候、可以更多地和自然界接近、還可以將敎室的圍牆擴充到社會各方面去、不僅進一步有活的事物給你學、還可以在現實的社會裏、試作各人愛作的事情、可惜我國的學生、在暑假回家的時間内、因爲家庭别離後的分外姑息、和比較規則生活的破壞、只是增加疾病的、死亡的機會、</p>
<p>二十一年度的暑假是來到了、這是在東北倫亡後將到十個月、淞滬遭難後將近半的第一個暑假、在這一個月内、大多數的男女學生、都將走上暑假的歸途、</p>
<p>暑假裏幹點什麽呢、這是每個學生捲起鋪蓋前應該自問的、我且介紹幾點貢獻給大家、</p>
<p>（一）將國難的創痕深印入民間諸君在學校裏尚且要缺課出去演講、現在是最好的機會了、中等以上的學生可集合同志、到各鄉開辦暑期學校、或講習會、旣可宣傳國難、又可提高農民知識、（二）調查仇貨詳細地調查各地仇貨的名稱、數量·運輸方法·經銷的主要商店等、並設法抵制、（三）到各處旅行去各人就經濟可能範圍以内、應到各處去旅行、這是活的敎育、得益很大、（四）試作各種標本、如各地農產物、及一切動物礦物、設能作成標本、暑後各人都携來集合在一起、自必有助於敎學</p>
<p>（五）去和天然界接近我國學生的體格大都不大健康、而心理健康缺陷的更多、這於城市的學生尤其利害、這原有關於經濟的、政治的社會的各方面、但是太和自然界隔絕確是很大的原因、大家應利用暑假到鄉間去、到林間去、醒醒惶惑的迷夢和悵惘、把生命引到比較愉快的、平易的大道上去、</p>
<p>（六）複習或預習功課將過去的功課作一總複習、或將未來的功課試行預習、這是大家都知道有益的</p>
<p>以上只是提起比較大點而大家可以作到的暑期作業、但是要達到相當的效果、下面的兩點是很要注意的、</p>
<p>（一）維持比較有規則的生活不規則的飲食起居、不僅有礙暑期作業、並且於健康大有妨碍、尤其是暑天、</p>
<p>（二）不可有例外某時應作的事某件不應作的事、萬不可因特别原因致生例外、如有了例外、便什麽都完了、</p>
<p>青年學生喲、莫再讓睡覺·貪吃·放縱·又來侵襲了二十一年度的暑假希望你們愉快地接受暑期的來臨進取地利用暑期的長時間這就不能不先有一個工作計劃了、</p>
<p>要聞</p>

<p>壟斷東北金融</p>
<p>▲李芳新自東省歸來談話</p>

<p>▲日幣壟斷東省　東三省之金融、本爲日人壟　、以現行幣制而言、日人之金幣、流通額約三百餘萬元、金票在一萬三千萬左右、此項金票、流行朝鮮境内者十之四、餘均流行南滿、自九一八以後、　　金票、不下一二千萬、故金票流行東省、當在一萬之以上、約值國幣一萬五千萬元、而本國貨幣之流行者、有哈爾濱六銀行號所發之洋票六千萬元約值四千五六百萬元、奉天四行準備庫發行之現大洋、遼變後、約存四五百萬元、所值不過二三百萬元、吉林永衡官銀號所發大洋劵、約值七百餘萬元、黑龍江官銀行所發大洋劵、約值一千二三百萬元、天津各銀行之兌換劵、流入東省者、不過四五百萬元、共計八九千萬元、約當日幣之半、而盡爲日人所操縱矣、</p>
<p>▲僞幣僭纂國幣　九一八事變後、日軍所至、首將金融機關佔諸掌握、現已成立僞銀行、統一幣制辦法、亦己公布、用銀單位、幣爲純銀二三九一格蘭、我國幣條例所定、爲庫平純銀四分八厘、合二四·一七格蘭有零、相差千分之十一、其意欲使我國幣不能流行於東省、因東省民衆、見我國幣之銀色較僞國爲佳、同價通用、頗不合算、則必將收藏、或集數回爐另鑄、使將來東北境内、不見我國制幣、</p>
<p>▲消滅金融機關　東省舊幣、日人規定除中交兩行制幣、五年内得暫用外、其餘均限兩年内收回、而代以僞中央紙幣、舊有地方銀行、即各地之官銀號、現己改爲僞中央銀行支行、而於兩年内則完全澈底改易、換言之、即消滅、另由日人組織之、至一切官銀行舊幣、僅維持至本年年底爲止、先行分别清理、至期歸併僞中央銀行、</p>
<p>▲新紙幣將發行　僞中央銀行成立後、即由日人監督辦理、用以紙幣吸收現金之政策、將發行大批鈔票、現己在印刷中、不日即可流行僞國、至銀幣之鑄造、日人亦在籌備中、大致將瀋陽兵工廠附近之　造幣廠、加以修理、然後開工云</p>

<p>▲增購飛機　我國航空飛機最精銳之東北飛行隊二百餘架、均於九一八後、爲日人佔去、現存之中央飛行隊、對於國防上尚感不足、故擬於最短期間、向海外購買飛機、俟經費有辦法時、即將實行、</p>

<p>演講（如何救中國）</p>
<p>▲應潮州同鄉會四育救國團之請前日下午二時、潮州旅滬同鄉會四育救國團、特請新由東北到滬之中委朱霽青氏演講、計到會會員三百餘人、首由主席鄭正秋君致介紹詞、略謂、朱先生爲有功於民國之人、在朝在野、始終未忘革命、抱着百折不撓的精神、具着光明偉大的人格、此番東北歸來、情形熟悉、本會特請演講現狀、並指導救國方針、今日開會之意義、至爲重大、務望各本朱先生所指導於我們者、切實奮鬭、努力盚或等云、次由朱霽青氏演講、題爲如何救中國、（辭長另錄）復次由劉侯武君演述朱氏赴東北領導民衆奮鬭之始末、及此次來滬之使命、末由主席致詞勗勉而散、以下爲朱霽青演詞、</p>
<p>潮州旅滬同鄉會、對於國家社會各方面、向來都有很大的貢獻、此次又組織四育救國團、以鍛鍊身心而爲救國的準備、其用意之深遠、實在令人十二萬分的欽佩、兄弟在三個月以前、出發關外、指導武裝民衆從事救國工作、親眼看到了山河破碎的現象、和敵人横暴的行爲、心中本己懷抱着無限的悲憤此次因事回到京滬、得有機會和貴團諸君來討論救國問題、不禁又轉而爲之欣悅、這是因爲關外的同胞、爲了救國、正在那裏艱苦奮鬭、日盼後援而貴團諸君則正在這裏作救國的準備、在前方奮鬭的有人、在後方準備的也有人、似此前後相應、共同努力、東北失地必有收復的那一天、中華民族不致滅亡這豈不是一件可欣悅的事情麽、談到了救國這兩個字的意義、不用細說、就可知道國家遇着了危險而要去挽救、現在中國的危險甚多、但是最關重要的、要算是東北問題了東北之於中國、好比人身上的腦脊髓、人若是没有了腦脊髓則這個人必定要死亡、中國若是没有了東北、則中國必定要覆滅、漫說日本的大陸政策、不僅在侵佔不北乃是要吞併全中國就照歷史上的事實來講、中國自古以來的外患、都是來自北方如五胡亂華和元清入主中原、卽其列證、所以我們若想救中國必須先救東北、能救東北、　可以保全中國、那麽究竟如何去救東北呢、想來諸君都知道、不抵抗三字、旣己鑄成了大錯、而期望國際制裁、又好比鏡花水月、並無實效、在這種情勢之下、除以民族本身的力量、從事長期抵抗、不能獨責政府當局或其他在何一方面、而是要全體國民起來負責的、古人說得好、國家興亡、匹夫有責、東北之所以淪陷我們爲國民的旣然不能獨辭其咎、而今後要收復東北我們爲國民的、當然是責無旁貸、况且大凡國難之來、其主要的原因、在於政治不修明、而政治不修明的主要原因、則在於没有民主勢力、所以要想從根本上掃除外患必須爲國民的儘量去發揮民主勢力纔有功効之可言、兄弟在關外集合武裝民衆、組織東北救國軍着眼之點、就是在此、九一八事變之初日軍在二十四時之内、佔了遼吉兩省的土地、其後處處遇到民衆的反抗、迄今己九閱月、不但未得安然統治而且疲於奔命、可鑡民衆武力是如何的强大、同時更可見祇有民衆武力、纔能保持民族的光榮了）剛纔己經說過、要救東北祇有長期抵抗的一個途徑面談到了長期抵抗則必須有長期抵抗的準備但這所謂準備、並非是說專等着举備數年或十數年、然後纔去抵抗、乃是說要一面抵抗、一面準備、如此雙方面同時並進不屈不撓、再接再厲的堅持到底、則以中國土地之廣大、人口之衆多、物產之豐富、相信必能獲得最後的勝利反之倘若專等着準備數年或十數年之後、再去抵抗、則日本在這數年或十數年之期間内、就可以安然統治、造成根深蒂固的局面、到了那個時候、我們縱然要去抵抗、而爲時己晚、恐怕至少也是不易爲力、目下東北同胞正在前方誓死抗敵、使日本不能得到安然統治的機會、至於能否堅持到底、則要全看後方的同胞、能否積極的努力準備、去援助他們了、準備可分爲物質和精神兩方面、物質的創造和發明、有賴於精神的作用、但是要精神發生作用、也不能不賴於物質的供給、試看抗日的東北武裝民衆、他們的民族精神、可以說是表現得十足了、但是若没有物質的接濟、也是不能赤手空拳手殺敵、如此說起來、精神和物質是互爲表裏、而不能分開的、貴團的名稱、是四有救國團、貴團的宗旨、是鍛鍊身心、爲救國之準備、所謂四育就是體育·德育·智育·羣育·體育在養成健全的體格、德育在養成高尚的道德、智育在養成豐富的智識、羣育在養成合羣的能力、換句話說羣育就是要精誠團結、貴團諸君當然是要以健全的體格高尚的道德豐富的智識而精誠團結來救國、中國的全體國民、在四萬萬以上其中有健全體格高尚道德豐富智識的也不少、可惜不能精誠團結、好像一盤散沙、坐使國難一發而不可遏止、所以據兄弟的意思、諸君於四育这中、應該就羣育一項、特别痛下工夫、並且不可僅僅以之鍛鍊身心、而要一面鍛鍊身心、一面從事物質的發明或創造、如是方能算是完善的救國之準備、至於東北的情形、連日以來、兄弟己經屢次在報紙上發表過、可以不用詳細的來重說、現在只好簡單的歸納各方面的情形說幾句日軍在東北旣佔領了我們的領土、破壞了我們全權、還在用種種壓迫手段、要驅逐我們的人民、打算在名義上事實上把東三省完全化爲日本的殖民地、再進而吞併全中國、以貫澈其所謂大陸政策、這是國人應該時時刻刻加以深切注意的、日本雖然有這樣的陰謀毒計、但是九一八事變以來、迄今已九閱月、未得到安然統治的機會固不待說、而且感受幾種很大的困難、第一、現在日軍祗能駐紮於各城市中及各鐵路沿線不敢輕易的離開十里或二十里以外若是離開了、往往被武裝民衆撲滅、第二、事變以來在我國遭極大的蹂躪、而在彼亦受極大的損失、日本侵略東北的大本營、旣往每年收入、平均在兩億元日金、純利亦不下三千萬元日金、乃自去年四月一日到今年三月三十一日的一年間、不但没有利益可言、反而虧損了三百四十餘萬元、南滿公司猶且如此、其他更可想見、第三、日本政府因爲經濟不振、而軍費浩繁、財政已入不敷出、到今年四月底爲止、他們國庫的歲入不足額、竟達一億數千餘萬元、長此以往、其何以堪、况且日本之佔據東北、並不是他們全體國民的意志、乃是軍閥的任意行動、就某種意義而言、也是日本軍權和民權之爭、日本民權運動、年來日盛一日、軍閥爲維持他們特殊的統治地位、竟不惜勞民傷財、藉口發展國家的勢力、以佔據我東北而壓迫我民權運動、日本軍閥的此種行爲、不啻替他們國家掘下墳墓、自投没落之路、但是他們没落時期的遠近、和我們所受犧牲的大小、則全要看我們中華民族奮鬥的如何了、兄弟很熱烈的希望貴團諸君、都成爲救國的英雄、以收復東北而保存全中國、</p>

象、旋風頗强烈、揚子流域及此間海濱天曇而甚熱、恐有雷電、馬鞍島以南沿海一帶天晴、有東南風、又昨日下午三時前二十四小時内埠氣温最高九六·六、最低七七·○、去年同日最高八八·二、最低七一·四、特載廢兩改元尚待何時　　江禮璪·　　本文爲作者擬在九月間中國經濟學社年會演講稿中之一節、今滬電傳來、己有廢兩改元之提議、欣喜無似、深恐我國人心理、對此重大必要之改革、仍有懷疑加以妨阻者、爰先摘錄送登、語云、時乎時乎不再來、望金融業有以加之意也、　　二十一年七月八日於青島　　改革幣制之呼聲。己三十餘年。精琦衛斯林之金匯兌本位制。甘末爾氏之逐漸采行金本位制。汪大爕梁啓超以及朝野名流之建議。聚訟盈庭。迄未實行。今國難當前。金銀之比價日高。世界經濟恐慌。原係金本位之國。尚多禁金出口停廢金本位者。以我國力及環境。此時改銀爲金。徒唱高調。萬無實行之可能。或正因用銀而獲益。故暫將金銀以及理想的本位擱而不論。先求相對的整理幣制安定金融。當以廢兩改元爲第一步。　　夫銀元銀兩之間。吾人固無軒輊。銀兩亦可。銀元亦可。但决不能同時並存而不統一。使金融業須有二重之準備。致無謂之緊急。最近密勒評論報載有俞寰澄先生論文。主廢元改兩。仿英之金塊本位而爲銀塊本位。固亦言之成理。然英行金塊本位。（一）因保護現金勿使分散。（二）存欵通貨之勢力盛於紙幣。（三）人民日常本少現幣之需求。衡以我國國情。似不適合。且俞君之意。民間日用。仍係銀元。僅於兌換。定一比價。由中央銀行維持之。是不過爲統一銀兩兩元並用之方法。仍許二物之並存。據金融商業報耿愛德君之估計。全國通行銀元數額。約爲十七萬萬零七百萬元以上。若謂廢元改兩。則置此大宗銀元於何地。若謂結果仍以銀元爲單位。則何必多此周折。故鄙見總以廢兩改元爲較合現狀。查廢兩改元。倡於民國六年上海商會會董蘇本炎先生。議而未行。其後馬寅初。金國寳。朱彬元諸先生。以及銀行週報等刋物。亦復鼓吹不遺餘力。厦門寗波及其他各處。早已實行。青島亦於民國十八年由明華銀行總經理張　伯先生之倡議。中交及各銀行之贊同。廢除膠銀。當時本地正金銀行。因該行向握青市對外匯兌之權。操縱膠銀與洋元之厘價。是其慣技。深恐因之損失挹　膠銀操縱金融之權利。曾欲暗中梗阻。運動無知者反對。卒以我方堅持成議。團結甚力。由張君及中交代表親往正金交涉。得以消弭無形。自廢膠銀後。數年以來。市面日形發達。未聞有因之而受影響者。新開之銀號錢莊。反年有增加。可知廢兩改元一事。實己至水到渠成之時。苟能協力團結。妥議辦法。無所用其顧慮矣。　　據金國寳君著中國幣制問題所載廢兩之阻力有二。　　（一）總稅務司安格聯之反對。其所持理由。爲關稅與外債有關。若改徵國幣。須得各國之銀行團承認。尤須以外銀行之簿記。能否改兩爲元而定。必須中國有全國通用之貨幣。改良造幣廠之管理而後可。又如欲更改。須能證明改後稅收必可增加。不致影響債賠各欵。方可實行。　　（二）錢業該書據馬寅初演講集第二集之推論。錢業不願廢兩之理由有二。甲、錢莊於客戸存洋時。必按厘市减去一毫二忽五。折銀入帳。支出銀元時。則增加一毫二忽五付帳。若廢兩改元。則無此利。乙、錢業莊票勢力甚大。莊票以規元爲本位。若廢兩改元。則銀票去洋票來。洋票可由銀行發行。將來信用漸著。莊票即被打倒。錢莊之勢力潰敗矣。　　又據朱彬元君著貨幣銀行學。謂民國十四年。上海銀根奇緊。現銀缺乏。拆息高至七錢以外。銀行公會倡議銀洋並用。定規元千兩等於銀元一千三百八十元。銀洋旣可通用。則銀拆洋厘均可壓低。商界可無須二重準備。惟爲錢業所對。未得實行。據云其反對理由。（一）對造幣廠成色無確實信用。（二）上海錢莊有銀帳無洋帳。洋元存欵亦折合銀兩。從中取利。若廢兩改元。則利益喪失。（三）銀洋互換。法價恐難維持。（四）銀洋雖並用。而用洋較便利。洋元之用廣。銀行可多發鈔票。上海將由現銀碼頭變成紙碼頭。　　上述反對理由。實不充分。茲先言總稅務司之所顧慮者。不外爲改元之後。稅收或有减少。因之影響債賠各欵。而銀元成色。若非管理得法。亦有减低之虞。夫今日關稅業經自主。稅收增加。遠非昔比。外債償還已多。賠欵大部約定退還爲中國自身建設之需。外人之與關稅有關者。僅佔全額中之一部分。即使因之减少。亦無傷於外債。况債賠各欵。本以外幣爲本位。近且關稅征金。萬無减少之可能乎。至銀元成色之穏定己爲我四萬萬人直接行使者所公認。全國通行無阻。總稅務司尚有何理由可以反對。總稅務司安格聯。英人也。試問一九三一年九月廿日英國突將金本位取消。改爲不換紙幣。鎊價大落。外人之有英國債權者。損失何啻千萬。向誰取償乎。英政府事前亦曾得債權者之同意乎。以彼例此。當知總稅務司之理由。毫無成立之可能。至外商銷售外貨。自亦期望幣制之統一。以免商人於金銀兌換外再負銀洋比價之危險、影響洋貨之銷路。則無容疑者也。　　次論錢業所持之理由。除銀洋互換之法價維持外。可綜括爲（一）莊票問題。（二）銀元成色信用問題、（三）紙碼頭問題。（四）記帳單位及一毫二忽五之利益問題。今亦一一剖析。加以研究。　　（一）莊票問題金融機關之信用。乃基於其本身之組織及經營。與所用貨幣。毫無關係。錢業之信用。乃基於其久遠之歷史。經騐宏富。深入民間。及股東責任之無限。故外人信用莊票。逾於有限責任之銀行所發之本票。蓋錢莊倒閉。除非該錢莊之股東全體破產。所有債務。必須償付。而按照公會章程。對於莊票必須先付。若不能支付。由公會負責清理。此其重重擔保。即爲信用所在。反之有限責任銀行之本票。若遇清理。銀行無償付之力時。即無負責之人可向索討。又按照銀行法。鈔票儲蓄存欵及一千元以下之存欵。有先於其他債務受償之權。錢莊習慣。則莊票清理先於一切債務。此即本票之不及莊票處。若言本票。則銀行何嘗不可開發銀兩之本票。故廢兩改元。如果實行。錢莊莊票所用貨幣。即可改爲銀元。信用流通。必仍駕銀行本票之上。而毫無影響。　　（二）銀元成色信用問題斯言也。若出於外銀行之口。吾人尚可諒其爲帝國主義妨阻殖民地求進之慣技。錢業爲百業領袖。安可爲此言乎。造幣廠化騐成色。早經實行。錢業亦爲參加之員。我國幣制之有一線曙光者。獨賴此銀元成色之信用耳。此豈兩元並存之功。同爲白銀。强分鴻溝。故今日銀洋比價之洋厘。完全保兩者供需之升降。與成色無關。豈七錢一分時之銀元成色。與七錢三分時之銀元成色有所不同乎。錢業對於銀元成色。旣有懷疑。而領用代表銀元以銀元爲準備之鈔票。代爲發行。則爲數頗鉅。吾知錢業諸公。决不爲此言也。（未完）來件中國民治促成會發起宣言　　馬相伯·　　五、就民治以實况言、我國民喜喫鴉片毒藥、無可諱言、毒藥之變本加厲、有所謂白麵、海洛英等、一日百元方過瘾、於是客貨之偷消日益多北晋秦、南桂黔、及長江一帶、鄉村集鎭、滔滔皆黑籍之氓、内則迫種鴉征以籌餉、新法又買賣毒藥以增稅、於是由餓殍而盜賊、愈聚愈多、調查所不能及、耳目所不能周、以故、非用人民地方自治、根本謀改造不可、試從鄉保甲組織起、十戸一保甲、不止十戸亦無妨、什戸長長之、百戸一中甲、佰戸長長之、千戸一大甲、仟戸長長之、仟戸佰戸、皆由什戸而積成、什戸長之責、在　察左右隣十家上下、有無匪類、奸細、烟瘾游惰之民而已、勿須抛却本身職業、以執行此名譽職也、此什佰任戸長、與本地各業首領、曁有政治經驗者、組織地方議會、以處理地方公務、故不費地方經費、便能保護地方治安、類如租界之董事、是矣、地方之分治法、縣分東西南北四鄉、鄉分東西南北四區、區用登記編戸籍、斷無一人一戸、在此區鄉縣之外者、縣名縣治、仍還其舊、各歸舊府治、惟同名者改之、府屬第宅、非地方之稱、故改稱郡、郡亦縣也、可擇其交通便利、者以兼之、聯二郡爲聯州、州亦郡也、擇其形勢攻守便利者兼之、逼近邊疆之聯州、至多可聯三郡、三郡土地人民恐己超過比國與聯詶制度規模太費、不可不慮、聯州締於中央、國都可擇國中、道里相距之中者、爲地點、偏於北亦無妨、至國會招集地點、不妨有四五處、使荒僻之區、亦易於開化、聯州旣告成、立州聯憲法（憲法撮要附後）、凡一鄉一區、偶遭外冠、全國之鄉區、皆平均各輸財力以輔助之、如此、尚有不愛國者、乎勢將國愈大而輔助愈多、於上海人之愛十九軍、可見一班、故欲修明内政、捍禦外患、唯有促成民治、爲我中華惟一救命星、救命圈、（未完）鐵路負責運輸法規基本原則　　（續四日稿）鄭寶照·　　（二）公共運輸人之定義　　（一）公共運輸人之特殊責任公共運輸人受法律之制裁、對於所承運貨物、如有損害發生、除非另有特殊規定外、須負絕對責任、此種法律之性質、係特殊的、對於尋常保管及管理他人貨物者、並不實用、卽以普通情形而言、凡人對於他人所交付之產物、若因本人在保管上怠於合理化之注意及處置、而此種保管之注意及處置、爲任何普通謹愼人對於自己產物應有之行爲、以致發生損害、亦必須完全負責、因此項特殊、責任之關係、凡關於運輸人之法律、於是成爲特種條例矣、　　（二）特殊責任之必要泛而言之、公共運輸人受人之託、保管並管理個人之產物、是一帶物人對於他人所交付之產物、祗須施行普通之注意及處置、設若發生偷竊火災以及其他損害情事、除非貨物所有人可以充分證明、此項損害係因帶物人對於平常謹愼人保護自己財產應有之注意及處置、有怠忽之處、則不負責、進而言之、凡貨物交付公共運輸人代運以後、則運輸人所處之特殊地位、自較寄貨人優越、此乃極明顯之事實、蓋當貨物在運輸中途時、寄貨人己無管理之可能、對於貨物之情形、己無從明瞭、以事實之必然、僅可信任全權辦理之運輸人、如何運用其忠實及技能耳、法庭方面、早己明瞭此情形、種於是規定運輸人應負重大程度之責任、須在運輪終點將貨物妥交收貨人、方算盡職、惟恐運輸人對於貨運不盡妥交責任、如被原諒、則將容易釀成運輸人方面之欺詐行爲、而使貨物所有人有無從要求賠償之苦、所謂欺詐行爲、卽運輸人一面串通偷竊、幸災樂禍、一面又可完全不負責任、加之關於運輸之所有消息、均在運輸人或其代理人支配之下、則欲貨物所有人證明貨物損害、係因運輸人之錯誤疏忽而發生、將爲絕不可能、因以上所述特殊責任之規定、於是自然發生兩種情形、一卽法庭方面、必須妥愼規定運輸人所應負之責任、及其負責之程度、一卽運輸人方面、往往在可能範圍以内、極力設法限制此種特殊責任之擔負、故此種特殊責任規定之應用及範圍、實爲吾人研究運輸人問題、必須注意之要點也、　　（三）運輸人必須盡責服務公衆何謂公共運輸人、其定義頗多、茲請舉一最簡明之定義如下、（公共運輸人乃是一種企業、應公衆之租用、運輸貨物、對於任何人均須一視同仁、不分軒輊、）凡負公共運輸人特殊責任之運輸人、對於公衆必須擔負運輸一種或多種貨物之義務、久已成爲確定之原則、設若某運輸人並未曾明白表示、擔負此種義務、則公衆如欲租用、不可相强以保險人之責任、該運輸人雖可於特殊情形之下、收取酬報、代運貨物、但儘可作爲私用運輸人論、祗負普通出租帶物人之責任、卽對於承運貨物、因怠於普通注意所發生之損害、須負全責、公共運輸人與私用運輸人之最大區别、卽前者對於任何人託運之請求、均須不分軒輊一律承運、而後者僅於特别情形之下、答應承運個人之貨物耳、（四）種種規則許多法庭認爲若欲運輸人担負保險人之責任、則其隨時聽候公衆需用、實爲必要條件、並主張某運輸人若係供給公共運輸人之運輸業務、亦可担負保險人之責会、例如本薛文尼亞地方、曾發生一事、被告係一農夫、自送一批鐵料由某處運至某處、在歸來時、自動請求爲原告代送一批貨物、運至原來出發地點、行至中途、貨物内容受糖汁浸潤、於是完全損害、當時該地方多數貨車夫、係爲普通公衆運輸貨物、至於該被告不過偶然代運貨物、其平常職業則爲農夫、但在上述情形之下、伊係挽運原告之貨物、一如公共運輸人然、故被法庭判决作爲公共運輸人處置、對於自身任何疏忽、須負全責、由此可見、凡出租運貨之貨車夫無論運輸、是其直接業務、或是臨時被僱、均可以公共運輸人論、以上所述之農夫、雖非受人之信記、而供給業務、但反而言之、旣係自動攬載、故法庭主張其業務之供給、對於保險人之責任、無法减輕、在以上主張之反面、又有主權之說、卽該被告受原告之請求、代運貨物、大可不負任何義務、根本拒絕、則爲毫無疑問者、設若某運輸人爲公共運輸人、則對於任何人之請求託運、均須承接、不得拒絕、蓋其運輸業務、係自願妥備、聽候公用、故有一律承接不能拒

<p>自由談	九三老人馬相伯語录王陽明格竹子  九　　中國人不講邏輯，不講格物，所以哲學不發達，科學也不發達；思想幼稚，生活也幼稚。做起文章來，祗知道咬文嚼字，絕不顧到思路是否通順，意思是否矛盾，你若將每篇文章，細細解剖，眞是滿目瘡痍，雖送到病院裏，也不勝其宰割。道還算了，可是所謂（格物），更是中國有史以來所未見。大家定要駁吾王陽明也曾格物，其實陽明的（格物）眞可做一段笑料：　　（初年，與錢友同論做聖賢要格天下之物。如今安得這等大的力量？因指亭前竹子令去格看。錢子早夜去窮格竹子的道理，竭其心思，至於三日，便致勞神成疾！當初說他這是精力不足，某因自去窮格，早夜不得其理，到七日，亦以勞思致疾，遂相與歎聖賢是做不得的，無他大的力量去格物了。　　及在夷中三年，頗見得此意思，乃知天下之物本無可格者，其格物之功，只在身上做。······）（見王陽明語錄）　　原來王陽明的格物，目的在做聖人，他的學生格竹子格了三日，就致（勞神成疾，王老夫子總算有些涵養，竟格了七日，也不免（勞思致疾）。在夷中三年竟大澈大悟，方知格物是没用的，格物祗須在身心上做，從此就造成了君臣父子的格物學，也呌做理學，像這種格物，還要得麽？瓦特看了爐上的水壺，就發明蒸汽的動力，假定王陽明與瓦特同時知道了這件事豈不要羞死！值得介紹的國貨工廠（二）  何躬行　　（三）醫用縫線工廠　　我國醫用物品。莫不仰給外洋。卽外科用之縫線。向以日貨爲大宗。每年行銷我國。其價值不在少數。考其原料。仍不外我國之絲及貓屬兩項。經其多方製煉。卽成醫用物品。上海大東門外德大絲線號。主人張芝崗君。本其數十年製造絲線經騐。進而研究此項縫線製造法。迭經改良。始告成功。現經滬地各醫師試用。均認爲與西貨相伯仲。較日貨則有過之無不及。上海五洲中英各藥房。紛紛定購。應接不暇。張君認爲有大規模組織必要。就德大原址。籌設德大機製化學消毒縫皮絲線廠。從此楚材楚用。杜塞漏扈。挽回利權。國貨前途。至有光也。　　縫線有四種。（軟）（硬）（扁）（貓腸）。每種長短粗細不一。軟者有十二類。硬者有十五類。扁者有十類。貓腸者亦有十類。貓腸係縫人腸之用。軟硬扁等線。係縫人類皮膚之用。貓腸卽係人家畜養之貓腸所製。其餘則以廠絲造之。　　德日派醫師慣用軟線。英美派醫師慣用硬線。其效用則同。硬線以打計。每打重量。同線之長短則不同。軟線以籮計。每籮縫線之長短同。重量則不同。扁線亦以打計。每打十二板。每板六碼。所以如此者。仿外貨例。來路如是所以便利醫界購辦也。　　軟線每籮重十五兩。價洋四十三元二角。硬線每打重九錢六分。價洋四元。扁線每打重量同。硬線價洋五元。至貓腸。每條至長者三尺。每十二條價洋八元。　　普通之絲線。多以兩股絲絞之。縫線則須用三股絞成。所以使其堅韌。不致中斷。蓋割症開刀。生死關頭時。此項縫線。自宜十分堅韌也。每五絲爲一股。三股爲一條。九條爲一支。。十支爲一袋。十二袋裝一盒。是謂一打。線之粗者用粗絲。細者用細絲。粗細不同。用絲五根則一也。　　製線手續（一）掉絲。（二）分粗細。（三）理絲頭。（四）打繳。（五）消毒。（六）　線。秘者。秘之生光也。盾之軟硬。在乎消毒時間之久暫。多蒸質軟。少蒸質硬。　　貓腸（一）去脂膀。（二）經長時間漂洗。（須一星期）（三）曝乾。（四）用醫用剪開爲條。（五）消毒。縫線所用之絲。必須廠絲。一則均匀。一則堅細。蓋人類皮膚原非綢緞布匹可比。如一線粗細不匀。施用手術時。必大感痛苦矣。　　德大所製縫線。較之外貨。以白有光。拉力强。價格廉。物質雖微。關係浩大。我以產絲之國。此項物品。不特供本國醫界自用。抑可推銷外洋。曾持此線。向各醫學博士請敎。僉云勝於外貨。有樣品陳列於中華國貨指導所。歡迎醫家前往參觀焉。名流趣屑  烟雨　　▲四百萬前商務印書館總經理王雲五先生。體胖而身矮。平時愛穿革履、配以西裝袴。外加長衫一襲。固儼然學生打扮也。先生有一綽號。曰（四百萬）。頗流行於時。世人蓋因（四）角號碼。（百）科全書。及（萬）有文庫三者。皆係彼一人竭畢生精力。所擘劃經營。故以名之。先生苟自顧名思義。亦足以自豪自慰矣。但幸勿誤會。以爲先生己積資達四百萬。彼固依然一窮書生也。　　▲生意人　現任申報館記者陳彬龢先生。爲日本研究專家。亦國内有數之學者也。日前在某處演講。會塲中有初識先生面目者。私謂其旁座之友人曰。（看他平頭方臉。一副生意人腔調。眞看不出竟是報館裏的名記者呀）。　　▲劉大砲　滬江大學校長劉湛恩君。擅口才。每逢登壇演講、輒口若懸河。滔滔不絕。尤好吭聲作壯語。一鳴驚人。故同學間多以（劉大砲）呼之云。戰後之北站  志政　　當淞滬戰事發生。北站首當其衝。其總局於一月廿九日被燬。其餘損失。不可勝計。茲者戰事己過。兩路當局。力謀整頓北站秩序。視戰前爲尤佳。爰分誌之。　　▲取締旅館招待喧譁以前每當列車到站。各旅館招待。各呼其旅館之名。喧嘩之聲。遠近可聞。一般宵小。復乘機施其技倆。秩序因之混亂。陳局長爲杜微防漸計。特飭警嚴厲取締。凡旅館招待。立于鐵欄之外。不准　入旅客往來要道。一面禁止喧譁。違者拘罰。故近來旅客下車。已不復聞若輩之喧囂。秩序井然。行旅稱便。　　▲改良餐車　餐車昔招商承辦。近則收歸自理。車務處鑒於旅客需要。特令飭嚴加整頓。第一、注意於衛生方面。食品務求新鮮。廚司愼重遴選。第二、注意於質量方面。力矯往日因循敷衍之惡習。車務處長鄭揚生氏。召見各餐車管事訓話時。特鄭重告試。務使顧客滿意。日來氣象已覺一新。并有不日增設中菜之議。歡迎旅客隨時報告。更求改善。　　▲舊址拆除將竣管理局舊址旣燬。業已無可再用。特雇工拆除。近已將竣。碎磚堆積如山。該局於清光緒間建築。已用廿餘年。倘不被燬。可再用三十年。工事甚堅。拆卸極難。茲聞將暫就原址。興築二樓辦公。新總站地點尚在勘測中也。　　▲售票房之幸運售票房距總站僅丈餘。且係木質。最易着火。乃此次竟未波及。誠幸運極矣。行李房則付諸灰燼。二處相距。又不滿丈餘也。行李房即將與工。現暫就以前之行李寄存室辦事。地小不敷應用。此外新建女厠所。已告竣工云。記北疆博物院之遊  柳雯　　月前因公赴津。承工商學院當局之邀。前往參觀。並得一瞻北疆博物院之勝。洵可謂不虚此行矣。爰濡筆誌之。北疆博物院位於馬塲道海河整委會畔。工商學院之側。該院雖落成未久。惟因全賴黎桑博士Ｌe　Ｒ·　ＰereLicent氏二十年來游歷我國黄河流域。以及西北各地。到處搜集所得。故院址僅棲室兩層。而入内已覺包羅萬象矣。　　黎桑氏白髮婆娑。而精神矍鑠。隨時指說。極爲詳盡。對於該院陳列各物。在考古學上。實含有極大之貢獻也。　　　　於入門正面玻璃橱中。列一我國古代原始動物之骨骼。趾高背隆。而軀幹高於常人。察其形狀。類似野牛。特鼻上又有軟角二。據云即考古家亦不知其果何名也。　此外陳列關於地質學之鑛物。達四千餘種。細觀化石斷片。魚類鱗腮。歷歷可辨。其也更有自甘肅掘得之古代武器（石質箭頭。或爲古代人類自衛之具耳。　　古代銅器。搜羅尤富。在歷史上均有莫大之價值。他如魚類烏類。縻不具備。即微小之昆蟲。亦有一千箱之夥。關於西藏蒙古一帶之土人服飾。及手工作品。亦將陳述迨遍矣。　　另一室專爲陳列黎桑氏所獵得之獸類標本。若甘肅之㸳羊與豹。以及狼狐猞猁之類。凡百餘種。最奇者爲兩體相連二首二尾八足之小猪。最大者則爲在青海所獲之獸。視其形狀。亦驢亦馬。即土人亦不知其何名也。流血慘劇之一頁  勞人　　上月嘉善母猪塘。發生一離奇慘殺案。兇手在一夜間。手刃男女至四人之多。目的旣非復仇。又非刦財。眞相頗難臆測。該案遐邇轟傳。報端未見有隻字紀載。爰泚筆誌之。有在嘉善縣政府催徵員之柏金生。年已古稀。某夕。買漁舟一葉赴鄉鎭公幹。舟子夫婦。與柏素稔。照章晚間不受雇。亦破例允之。當舟進發時。經滬杭路洋橋畔。朦朧中有客呼渡甚急。舟子告以船有主。未便再招徠也。岸上客復高聲固請謂我等擺至對岸即足。夜色蒼藹。諸希行一方小便。厚給船資可耳。柏聽客辭。遂動惻隠之心。命舟子將船攏岸。姑試渡此不速客。比登舟。細辨之。爲二軀幹魁梧之偉丈夫。容貌猙獰。似非善類。至是舟子乃繼續鼓其如飛雙漿前進。未幾。二客忽揚言曰。吾輩不能登岸矣。今晚即雇汝舟至某處可乎。舟子異甚。告之主權在柏。况君等言明係至對岸。何更得寸進步耶。二客聞斯語。立變態容。目眦盡裂。一客懷中出七首。直剸舟子胸。立斃於船梢。柏及舟子夫婦在旁睹狀蟽。均戰慄無人色。蜷伏不敢動。客復以刀向柏亂剌。希殺之滅跡。可憐此白髮如銀之縣府催徵員。竟哀號而死。二客立改怒狀。嬲舟子婦求歡。婦痛夫心切。驚駭莫名。焉允俯從。遽向河中一躍。刹那間。追隨其夫於地下。與波臣爲伍矣。二客以神智昏亂。肇此巨禍。乃獨棄舟圖遁。時天已微明。止於一草屋外。叩扇入。請假一席地作避禍計。屋主拒而不納。二客又出利刃相要挾。用繩將屋主綑縛。塞敗絮於口中。擲之屋隅。嚇禁聲張。不料鄰女杭大寳。患病多日。思嘗新味。携錢至草屋。欲請屋主黎明赴市廛之便。代購鮮魚二尾。甫入門。即見此殺人惡神。二客驚女美。邪念大動。結果女以力弱遭姦污。臨行復殺女而去。斯時。駐於窰鎭之水警保衛團得舟子之報告。追踪至　蓋舟子所中非要害。匍匐作僞死狀也。雙方相遇。各出手槍轟擊。達十分鐘。流彈又斃一行人。而此一雙罪大惡極之殺人犯。卒爲兎脫。不知所終上海的馬路  徐本熙　　擁，忙，擠，閒，肉，汗的臭味，惱人的幽香，和着所有的色素所凑成的上海的馬路，是多麽地奇炫而擾攘啊丨這充滿了俗氣的鬧市的街道，它十足的顯示了東方大都市所應有的色彩了·　　所以，如其我們在不經心的通常習慣裏，能夠稍微留意地加以觀察的時候，這東方大都市的上海的馬路，在我們跨到它上面時，便會使我們感到它是怎樣的不值得走·　　以上海馬路主席自居的南京路·這好像是最堂皇而富麗吧？其實，它就是一頭專吞中國金錢的異獸，時時刻刻張大着嘴狂噬吾們所不易得到的錢，世界上的事本這樣奇妙的·最好就等於最壞·此外，南京路一天到晚擠着人而竟不像Ａvenue的路能給你一些清趣·　　外灘尤其是洋氣十足，資本帝國主義所擁着的巍巍的高樓，它正高傲地向碼頭小工露着驕笑，好像說：（我要你命丨）　眞是奇事，五路財神的第四路，（四馬路）在大一點的雨汎時，終會得像小河渠·　　要是說取其清爽，那末，當然，梵皇渡麗娃栗妲村過去點的一條羅别根路，它就可給你所要的清趣的滿足·　　一個道路學家說；上海的馬路可分爲洋，濁，清，混，污五區，來代表東，南，西，北，中這句話，我認爲對的，洋，濁，清，混，四區，是形態上的顯示，只有污，是象微了中區精神上的黑點·</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Effect of the Lausanne Convention <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Lausanne Conference, lasting more than twenty days and fraught with numerous twists and turns, finally concluded on the 9th, thanks to the tenacious and extraordinary spirit and efforts of British Prime Minister MacDonald and others. Representatives of the participating countries signed the convention. Looking at the content of the Lausanne Convention, we cannot but acknowledge that the outcome of the conference has a relative success and will have a positive impact on the stability of international politics among European countries. Although the agreement may not produce all the expected effects, the German reparations issue, which had not been resolved by forty international conferences over more than twenty years, has now reached a satisfactory resolution. The plan to assist Austria has also been agreed upon by the five countries of Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and others. This will greatly benefit the easing of the long-standing tensions among the countries of Central, Western, and Southern Europe. The agreement also includes a political annex, stipulating that the signatory countries, for the sake of maintaining peace in political and economic aspects, should henceforth prohibit the excessive use of force or any form of military force. Although the wording of this annex is somewhat ambiguous, it is at least likely to have a positive impact on improving the atmosphere of peace in Europe for the time being.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A hungry person easily finds food, and a thirsty person easily finds a drink." At present, economic panic has spread to all countries, and the flaws of capitalism are constantly emerging. The opposition and conflicts of interest among countries are also becoming increasingly acute. However, the Lausanne Convention has surprisingly been concluded, instantly easing the tense situation in various parts of the European continent and the hearts of people burdened with sorrow and bitterness. The governments of European and American countries have unanimously expressed joy and celebrated the outcome of the parliament. This is a common human sentiment and nothing to be surprised about. However, after careful observation of the world and European issues, the thorns in the road ahead have not been removed. We dare not rush to overestimate the success of the Lausanne Conference.</p>
<p>Leaving aside other issues, just considering the Lausanne Convention itself, Germany and France still have many complaints and dissatisfactions with it. From the German perspective, the reparations responsibility has indeed been reduced. However, as the news spread, most Berlin newspapers criticized the convention and expressed deep dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Papen. This is because Germany failed to implement its demand for equal armaments at the conference and did not abolish the clauses on war guilt in the treaty. As a result, it agreed to pay 3 billion marks, which is deeply resented by most Germans. The gains and losses of Germany and France are opposite. What Germany loses is what France gains. However, most French people believe that France sacrificed a lot and gained nothing in this conference, so they are also dissatisfied with the outcome of the conference. Germany and France still have many misunderstandings. Even if the convention has the practical effect of promoting cooperation between the two countries, how can that effect not be discounted to some extent?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the effect of the Lausanne Convention is indirectly and directly related to the attitude of the United States towards European war debts. We must also carefully examine the attitude of the United States. On the surface, the United States has expressed pleasure with the outcome of the Lausanne Conference and has agreed to consider revising the amount of war debts, which is indeed good news for European countries. However, Washington has also issued a warning to Lausanne, stating that from a strategic point of view, it would be unwise for European debtor countries to discuss the issue of debt reduction with the United States before the U.S. presidential election in November of this year. Because at this time, requesting the United States to reduce the burden of debtor countries will increase the opposition to debt restructuring in the U.S. Congress and among the people of the entire country. In addition, prominent American bankers regard the outcome of the Lausanne Conference as one of the major obstacles to global recovery. However, they dare not lightly predict whether the decline of world commerce will be reversed as a result. From this, it can be seen that it is still difficult to say whether the outcome of the Lausanne Conference can reverse the global economic panic. Even if there is an effect, it cannot be realized immediately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, judging from the declaration in the Lausanne Convention, it is the unanimous desire of all signatory countries to enhance world and European peace. However, whether this desire can be achieved is also closely related to (disarmament). British Prime Minister MacDonald made a frank statement at the end of the conference, which included the following:</p>
<p>(...The agreements and treaties signed here must have a response elsewhere. My hope is that the disarmament conference will achieve great success in Geneva and end the waste of money on armaments. However, disarmament has not yet been successful. We must have courage and trust among the countries, and carry out moral disarmament... To achieve this goal, our friends in the East must join (speaking to the Japanese delegation). Japan must join and show loyalty to the League of Nations, the same as other countries...)</p>
<p>This desire for peace is truly the lofty spirit of the Lausanne Conference. However, there are many obstacles to the future of European and American military treaties, which are not easy to remove. Moreover, on the day that British Prime Minister MacDonald expressed his desire for peace at the Lausanne Conference, it happened to coincide with the time when Japanese Army Minister Araki expressed his determination to the League of Nations investigation team to recognize the puppet state and reject third-party intervention. Facing each other from afar, they ran in opposite directions. May I ask, how will the desire for peace expressed by the Lausanne Convention be achieved?</p>
<p>The effect of the Lausanne Convention cannot but make people doubt. However, it seems undeniable that the tense situation in European international politics has been temporarily eased by the signing of the Lausanne Convention. If the European international situation can be slightly stabilized in the near future, then the European powers, in order to maintain their capitalism and imperialism, will inevitably reorganize their anti-Russian front and pay more attention to their interests in the East. Japan, in order to implement its ambition of an Asian Monroe Doctrine and fearing Western intervention, will inevitably have various countermeasures to adapt to the current situation in order to deal with China and the European and American powers. If our government and celebrities do not carefully examine this, and hold firm to the spirit of independence and self-determination, and not yielding to foreign powers, and fulfill their due responsibilities, I am afraid that the European international situation may be temporarily stabilized, but the situation in the East will become increasingly entangled and unmanageable in the near future.</p>

Shell fragments scattered in all directions, and the entire temple was engulfed in flames in an instant. The sound of explosions intensified, and soon the sound of landmines detonating could also be heard.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After the explosion of Chen Tiaoyuan's ammunition depot in Dawang Temple on Shanghe Street outside Shuixi Gate on the morning of the 10th, dozens of residents in the vicinity were injured, including several seriously injured, who were taken to the Central Hospital for treatment by ambulances from the Municipal Health Bureau.

<p>According to Wang Huaqing, head of the Ordnance Department of the said military unit, the depot was established five months ago. All 1,000 mortar shells and 2,000 grenades were transported from Hefei a week ago. Four ships of bullets were also stored in the depot, totaling more than 3,000 mortar shells, 8,000 grenades, more than 300,000 Mauser lead bullets, and more than 300 over-the-shoulder cannon shells. These were all spoils of war from the former 46th Division's victory over Yan and Feng in the Lanfeng-Kaifeng area two years ago. Because they were poorly manufactured, they were transported to Nanjing for storage. This explosion was truly unfortunate. The cause of the incident and the amount of loss have been reported to Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of Military Affairs.</p>

<p>In Response to an Inquiry from the Ta Kung Pao</p>

<p>Remains Committed to Being a Kuomintang Member</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chiang Kai-shek received a telegram from the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on the 9th, stating that there were rumors that Chiang was organizing a Fascist group and requested a clarification. Chiang issued a formal statement on the evening of the 10th to correct public opinion. He stated that the organizational structure and methods of the Chinese revolution can only be those inherent structures and methods established by Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Kuomintang, to fulfill the mission of the Chinese National Revolution. Otherwise, if one insists on forcibly imitating foreign revolutionary methods and organizations that are absolutely contrary to the Chinese national character, not only will the revolution not succeed, but the country and the nation will not allow for such an experiment. The failure of the Chinese revolution today is due to the anti-revolutionary elements who betrayed the Premier and destroyed the Party's organization and methods. Since we cannot restore the unique and inherent organization and yet want to imitate the Italian Fascist organization and forcibly impose it on China, how is this different from the Communists wanting to communize China? Chiang can frankly and candidly reply to your newspaper that Chiang was born a Kuomintang member and will die a Party ghost. He only recognizes the Party's organization and the methods of the National Revolution. He not only does not endorse other organizations but absolutely opposes them. Chiang's sole aspiration is to restore the revolutionary spirit of this Party, the organization and methods of the National Revolution, and to realize the Three Principles of the People.

<p>Continues to Meet and Discuss</p>
<p>Decides to Submit the Principles of Rectification to the Executive Yuan for Approval</p>
<p>The Work of the Rectification Committee is Complete, No Need to Continue Unless Necessary</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central University Rectification Committee continued to meet at the Ministry of Education on the morning of the 10th, still chaired by Cai Yuanpei. The matters discussed were reportedly related to the reorganization of departments and institutes, the administrative structure of the school, and the issue of increasing professors' salaries. Resolutions were passed on each case and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval after reorganization. It was also heard that the Rectification Committee will recommend to the government that the CUHK's funding should be issued according to the actual amount, with no further discounts. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The CUHK Rectification Committee held its second meeting at the Ministry of Education on the 10th, chaired by Cai Wubei. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM. The meeting involved the following: 1. The Rectification Committee is a consultative body. Although it has decided on the principles of the CUHK reorganization plan, it will not be announced until after the Executive Yuan has made the final decision. 2. Dissolving the school is the last resort. If the problem cannot be thoroughly resolved after dissolution, then education will go bankrupt and student unrest will surge, which would be even more unthinkable. The committee members believe that this committee is not only thinking about CUHK but also serving as a touchstone for reorganizing national education. 3. The CUHK turmoil is a problem of money and people. The current issuance of 50% of funding is not enough to maintain CUHK. The government authorities have decided to do their best to raise funds from August onwards to fully issue the funds. Once the funding is stable, the selection of personnel will be discussed. 4. The selection of the president will be based on a pure scholar with less connection to party and government affairs, and someone who is satisfactory to all parties. The Rectification Committee will consult and seek agreement within a few days, and then announce it after the Executive Yuan meeting on the 12th. 5. The work of the Rectification Committee is complete, and there is no need to continue meeting unless necessary. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e45">The Issue of Abolishing the Taels and Using the Yuan <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Wang and Song Believe It Must Be Implemented</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Prepares Plans for Submission</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the issue of abolishing the taels and using the yuan, Song Ziwen, during his recent visit to Beijing, conducted detailed research with Premier Wang and many financial experts. They all agreed that China's currency system is extremely chaotic and that there is an urgent need for reform. Therefore, this matter will be implemented. The Ministry of Finance has prepared plans for the transition period and supplementary regulations, which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan and then transferred to the Central Political Council to determine the principles before being submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval. It will be implemented on a scheduled basis. The most important planning before implementation is to determine the legal silver dollar weight and minting. The legal silver dollars currently in use in China include ten types: Sun Yat-sen, Yuan Shikai, Daqing, Jiangnan, Hubei, Guangdong, Beiyang, Eagle Ocean, Standing Figure silver dollars, and Japanese yen and Saigon silver dollars. The latter two types are only commonly used in Xiamen, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Yunnan, and are not often seen inland. Their composition is close to 7 mace and 2 candareens, strong or weak, differing by nearly 5 li to 1.5 li. Eagle Ocean and Standing Figure silver dollars were originally from Mexican and United States silver dollars. The Ministry of Finance issued an order prohibiting imports last year when gold was expensive and silver was cheap. However, the inflow of these silver dollars did not start today. They are widely used in major cities across the country, and they are almost used as the currency standard. However, Hunan has recently rejected Eagle Ocean silver dollars, and each dollar must be taxed 3 to 5 cents. After the new standard silver coins are minted in the future, the quality of each foreign silver dollar will be reorganized. As for the minting of new silver dollars, the Shanghai and Hangzhou factories have been preparing for a long time. The first batch of manufacturing models has been entrusted to the national mints of the United Kingdom and the United States, and has been verified by Hu Weide, the chief engineer of the Shanghai Mint.

<p>Present Draft Resolution on Disarmament</p>
<p>Accepting the Hoover Plan in Principle</p>
<p>And Listing Key Points Agreed Upon by All Parties</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 9th: It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Simon is now preparing to submit a resolution to the Disarmament Conference before the summer recess, referring to Article 8 of the League of Nations Charter, the Paris Pact, and the concrete proposals of President Hoover, which the Disarmament Conference has, in principle, accepted. The resolution states the responsibility of the Disarmament Conference to establish a decisive step. The resolution also states that the main objective of the Disarmament Conference is to reduce the forces of aggression and maintain purely defensive forces. The resolution lists the points almost all participants have agreed upon and requests the major powers that signed the Washington and London Treaties to promptly discuss the key points regarding naval disarmament in President Hoover's proposals.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Geneva, 9th: Informal negotiations between the delegations of the United States, Britain, and France, as well as other delegations, are still actively underway. These negotiations concern the draft resolution on disarmament. After this draft is passed, the first phase of the Disarmament Conference will conclude. Yesterday, the French delegation held a two-hour meeting with the Little Entente and Poland. This conversation was entirely based on the plan proposed by Simon, but Simon's plan has not been fully finalized. According to the Minzu Daily, this plan includes:</p>
<p>Preamble: Describing Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant and the obligations arising from the Paris Peace Pact, as well as Hoover's proposal. This plan has been fully recognized by the General Assembly in principle. The draft convention prepared by the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference, the resolution on principles passed by the same commission, and the methods advocated by Hoover are all described in the preamble. The preamble also clarifies the task of the General Assembly: to strive to reduce armaments and complete the crucial first step, but should abide by the principle that various armaments are interconnected. The aim of the General Assembly is to limit the power of attack while maintaining the necessary defense forces.</p>
<p>Three Technical Issues: (First Technical Issue) Stipulates aviation affairs, including five definitions: (1) Determining the protection of ordinary people, (3) Strictly limiting the areas where aerial bombing can be carried out, (3) Abolishing bombing aircraft as much as possible, (4) Stipulating the maximum tonnage of combat aircraft, (5) Stipulating the manufacture of civil aircraft exceeding a certain limit. (Second Technical Issue) Stipulates land army affairs, the content being the abolition of assault vehicles and the prohibition of cannons with a caliber exceeding a certain limit. (Third Technical Issue) Stipulates the organization of a permanent committee to monitor future conventions so that they can be implemented in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 6 of the draft convention.</p>
<p>Special Annex: This annex stipulates the prohibition of toxic bacteria, chemical, and poison gas warfare.</p>
<p>Final Annex: This document stipulates that the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference should also meet during the holidays, especially to prepare precise documents, which should be delivered to the delegations at an appropriate time before the conference reconvenes. The work of the National Defense Costs Subcommittee cannot be interrupted. Finally, it requests that the signatory countries of the Washington Treaty and the London Treaty promptly negotiate the naval issues contained in Hoover's proposals or any other proposals submitted to the General Assembly, and the five naval powers should be responsible for reporting the results of their work to the General Assembly.</p>

<p>Approval of Treaty with Germany Requires Resolution of Own Debts First</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Lausanne, 9th: According to the (Gentlemen's Agreement) signed this morning, the creditor countries agreed that they will approve the Treaty of Lausanne with Germany only after their own debts are also satisfactorily resolved. Therefore, the Gentlemen's Agreement specifically stated that the implementation of the treaty with Germany is contingent upon a satisfactory resolution; otherwise, it will not be approved. In addition, it specifically stipulated that, given the newly arising situation, the creditor countries should consult with each other on how to act. In this way, the legal status of each creditor country is exactly the same as before Hoover's moratorium on war debts.</p>

At the same time, it stated that the U.S. government's attitude continues to oppose the cancellation of war debts, saying that the U.S. government is deeply pleased to hear of the establishment of the Lausanne Agreement, but feels that the U.S. attitude was clearly stated by President Hoover in his declaration of June 20, 1931, that it does not support the cancellation of war debts, because it believes that the settlement of such debts should be based on the debtor's ability to pay under normal circumstances, but that the current extraordinary state should be considered, etc., and it seems that it is not convenient to change at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Germany Will Be Satisfied with the Reparations Conference <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 9th: German Chancellor von Papen and other representatives who attended the Lausanne Conference are scheduled to return to Germany tomorrow afternoon, and von Papen has already convened a State Council meeting for Monday, at which a report on the proceedings of the Lausanne Conference will be given. Since the conclusion of the Lausanne Conference, all sectors of German society have been excited, and this issue has become the focus of current discussion. A representative of the Guomin News Agency visited leading figures in Berlin's financial circles, who all expressed extreme satisfaction with the outcome of this reparations conference. As a result, the amount of expenditure borne by Germany has been reduced to one-tenth of the original amount. Furthermore, the restrictions previously imposed on the German National Bank and state-owned railways have now been completely lifted, which is especially gratifying. As for German public opinion on the outcome of this reparations conference, according to political figures, Germany is now close to the date of parliamentary elections, and public opinion cannot avoid being influenced by internal political relations from time to time, making various excessive criticisms, especially by the organs of the extreme left and right. Therefore, as soon as the election period is over, it is feared that even the right-wing newspapers that are now extremely critical of Paris will change their attitude and acknowledge the success of the Lausanne Conference. Therefore, there is absolutely no doubt that the Lausanne Treaty will be approved by the next new parliament. Furthermore, according to the observations of various extremist factions, although Germany still has a burden of 300 million marks, being able to cancel this long-term offering early is sufficient to bring fortune to the country. As the Vossische Zeitung stated, the end of the Lausanne Conference is the end of the unequal treatment of Germany's economy by various countries, and since unequal economic treatment is the cause of the world's universal economic war, after today, the world may see a phenomenon of revival again. The conservative newspaper Berliner Börsen-Zeitung highly praised von Papen's demand for complete equality of treatment with all countries in terms of disarmament, and the cancellation of the Rhineland clauses contained in the Treaty of Versailles, and finally stated that although Germany still has a major burden, the fact that the right to freedom can finally be restored is still self-comforting.</p>

<p>▲ Havas, Lausanne, 9th: Today, various national delegations returned to their countries one after another. The Italian delegation departed at 2:00 PM, and the German delegation at 6:00 PM. The French delegation will depart at 11:00 PM tonight, arriving in Paris at 7:00 AM tomorrow morning. Herriot amplified his speech from yesterday's plenary meeting and broadcast it to the United States via wireless telephone at 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 9th: British Trade Minister Runciman and Finance Minister Chamberlain arrived here this afternoon, expressing satisfaction with the success of the Lausanne Conference.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Date of Economic Conference Convening <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>To Be Decided at League of Nations Meeting</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Geneva, 9th: Herriot traveled by car to Gopt, twelve kilometers from Geneva, in the evening to visit U.S. representative Gilbert. It is speculated that Herriot seems to want to discuss the situation of the Disarmament Conference with Gilbert and consult with the British delegation on the resolution proposed by Simon to conclude the first phase of the Geneva Disarmament Conference before returning to Paris. Furthermore, the various procedures for implementing the resolutions of the Lausanne Conference are closely related to the League of Nations. Therefore, as soon as the Chairman of the Lausanne Conference officially notifies the League of Nations of the Lausanne Treaty, the League of Nations Administrative Council will convene an emergency meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday to appoint a committee in accordance with the views of the Lausanne Conference to prepare for the economic and financial conference, determine the meeting period and location, and appoint the chairman of the conference. The British representative hopes that the conference will be held in November or December, because the chairman is scheduled to be MacDonald, and the hope of holding the meeting in Geneva is small, but the hope in London is high. This matter was discussed at the previous meeting. If the conference decides to hold the meeting in London, the League of Nations Executive Department and specialized departments will move to London. League of Nations Deputy Secretary-General Avenol will also stay in London with a portion of the members during the meeting. There are many difficulties in this preparation. If the work of the economic conference and the Geneva Disarmament Conference are held at the same time, one will lose sight of the other. Furthermore, the League of Nations General Assembly, originally scheduled to open on September 5th, will also be postponed to the 26th.</p>

<p>▲ Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: For the successor of the South Manchuria Railway President, Colonial Minister Nagai recommended Hara Tsugumichi as the successor. Although the matter was about to be completed, it was opposed by Army Minister Araki. Moreover, Nagai dismissed Kishimoto, the Governor of Karafuto, without reason. The Seiyukai had long been unable to vent their anger, but now they have found an excuse and are attacking him with drums beating. The dismissed Governor Kishimoto also issued an open letter to Colonial Minister Nagai today, launching a punitive expedition, severely scolding Nagai for being selfish and shameless. Prime Minister Saito is also having a headache over personnel issues, almost wanting to break his head.</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Deputy Chief of Staff Masaki, who was in Manchuria, arrived in Moji this morning from Dalian on the Taura Maru, saying that he encountered the righteous army on the way from Jinzhou to Shenyang, but the Japanese army immediately repelled them. As for the recognition of the Manchurian state, since there are two views in the country, a radical theory and an early theory, it is impossible to say which is right or wrong. Some say that the number of troops in Manchuria is too large, while others say that the military strength is insufficient. These are all misunderstandings, so it is necessary to negotiate with all parties after arriving in Beijing before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Seoul, 10th: Governor-General of Korea Ugaki departed from this city at 10:00 AM today and will arrive in Tokyo on the 14th.</p>

<p>▲ Hualian, Tokyo, 10th: In order to remedy the financial deficit, the Japanese Ministry of Finance's Budget Bureau and Tax Bureau are planning to increase taxes, but Finance Minister Takahashi said that the market conditions are still depressed and cannot withstand heavy taxes, advocating maintaining the status quo by issuing public bonds. Whether Japan's financial difficulties can be resolved is highly noteworthy.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The Japanese government's finances remain difficult, and the issuance of deficit public bonds is inevitable next year. From this, it can be inferred that the interest on deficit public bonds may have to be supplemented by public bonds. The Ministry of Finance's Secretariat has begun to investigate further tax increases or the creation of new taxes in order to compile the budget for the coming year. The outline of the new tax and tax increases is as follows: (1) The current 2% capital interest tax will be increased to 4%. (1) Interest from the Deposit Bureau will be treated as a second type of income for comprehensive taxation. (1) Special awards, commemorative awards, retirement pay, etc., will be treated as a third type of income for comprehensive taxation (1) Increase the progressive rates of the third type of income tax. (1) Increase the inheritance tax rate. (1) Create a gasoline tax and luxury tax. However, Finance Minister Takahashi has repeatedly stated since taking office that now is not the time to increase taxes, so it is doubtful whether he will approve it, but in view of the current situation, it is inevitable.</p>

<p>Massacring Righteous Troops in Heilongjiang</p>
<p>▲Zhang Wenzhu Aids Tyranny</p>
<p>▲Li Chengzhang Curses Traitors</p>
<p>▲Cheng Zhiyuan Sacrifices Railroads</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping reveals information from individuals from Heilongjiang. Since Cheng Zhiyuan assumed the position of puppet governor, he has not only been willing to serve as a puppet for the Japanese, harming people with ambition, but also revealing all of Marshal Ma's previous plans. His accomplice in aiding tyranny is the puppet Chief of Staff, Zhang Wenzhu. All insidious schemes pass through Zhang's hands, and he is now favored by the Japanese and Cheng, the traitor. Zhang, whose courtesy name is Dingyuan, is thirty-six years old, from Wuxi County, Sichuan Province, and a graduate of the Baoding Military Academy. He rose from company commander and aide-de-camp to staff officer. In the fourteenth year of the Republic [1925], when Ma Zhanshan was the commander of the Fourth Mixed Brigade of Heilongjiang, he promoted Zhang to be the Chief of Staff of that Brigade. Later, when Ma Zhanshan was promoted to the commander of the Seventeenth Division, he appointed Zhang as the Chief of Staff of the Seventeenth Division. When Wan Fulin was the Military Governor of Jiang, with Ma's support, he was appointed as the commander of the Second Regiment of the Cavalry First Brigade. Having received such favor from Ma, he has now lost his conscience and betrayed his principles, a truly lamentable example of human ingratitude. According to a person from Zhaodong County, after Cheng and Zhang harmed Marshal Ma's associates, the Japanese have placed exceptional trust in them. Cheng and Zhang are overjoyed and beside themselves with delight. Recently, translated copies of Marshal Ma's secret telegrams, such as the Jiang secret, the Kui secret, the Vice secret, and the Military secret telegrams, have been handed over to the Japanese. The Japanese have already reprinted many copies of these telegrams and distributed them to various locations to intercept news from various places. Currently, the people of all counties in Jiang Province are extremely indignant towards the Japanese and Cheng and Zhang, and have formed Red Spear Societies and Big Sword Teams for self-defense. The Japanese, recognizing the urgency of the situation, have telegraphed Japan, requesting the immediate dispatch of a large army to Heilongjiang. They have also ordered Cheng Zhiyuan to quickly form two cavalry detachments to attack anti-Japanese elements. On June 1st, Cheng Zhiyuan appointed Zhang Wenzhu as the commander of the First Cavalry Detachment, Jia Jinming as the commander of the Second Cavalry Detachment, and Zhou Zuolin as the Bandit Suppression督战 Commander, and together with the entire 16th Regiment of the Japanese 15th Brigade, they departed for the Zhaodong area to attack Li Haiqing's army. Zhang Wenzhu dispatched the Third Battalion Commander Tong Yuheng of the Second Brigade's supplementary regiment (Wang Shutang's unit) leading over three hundred soldiers, to launch a brave and fierce attack. Li Haiqing used eight thousand cavalry to surround and attack them. Tong's soldiers were at a loss, some surrendering and some fleeing. The puppet military officers were all executed by Li's army. The Japanese army, blaming Tong's battalion for its defeat, severely reprimanded Zhang Wenzhu and others for their ineffective combat and gave them two days to retake Zhaodong. At that time, Li Haiqing's army, stationed in the city, numbered approximately eight thousand men, deployed for defense. Zhang, under the order of the Japanese army, urgently督促團 (Quan Sheng), 祝團 (Feng Yang), 檀團 (Zi Xin), 霍團 and other regiments to attack with all their might. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented. Li's army, lacking artillery, had the north gate of the county town broken by the 凃團 and captured the 烧锅 and county government office. Li's army attacked from outside the courtyard. The 凃團 defended to the death without coming out. Li's army then bored holes in the residential houses to use as gunports and aimed their guns. When the 凃團 lacked water and went out to fetch it, Li's army shot and killed them. Beside the well outside the east wall of the county government office alone, there were over a hundred corpses. The 凃團, lacking sufficient water, then desperately attacked to the death. The two sides then engaged in street fighting. Due to the excessive number of people, the streets were crowded, and countless civilians were killed in the chaos. The Japanese army then used eight airplanes, flying low, to drop bombs continuously, along with five armored vehicles, using machine guns to strafe Li's army. The bullets fell like rain, and more than ten field guns fired in continuous volleys. Where the airplanes went, the artillery followed. The houses in the city collapsed, and the people were left with broken arms and legs. Li's army, unable to withstand the fierce destruction, retreated to the Fengle Township area. After the county town was occupied, the search for Li's troops was extremely strict. Currently, spring plowing in the Zhaodong and Zhaozhou areas is completely hopeless, and many people are displaced. Zhang Wenzhu captured Li Chengzhang, the Chief of Staff and Director of Finance of Li's army (also known as Li Dianwen), and sent him to the provincial capital on the 16th. Cheng, the traitor, personally interrogated him. Li Chengzhang loudly cursed Cheng's shamelessness and madness. Cheng then sentenced Li to death. On the day before the execution, he sent letters to the Japanese Consulate, the South Manchuria Railway Company, the Special Service Agency, and the Japanese Army Headquarters, inviting them to send people to attend the event. The Japanese temporarily notified the Public Security Bureau to prepare four hundred vehicles for their use. On that day, the crowd of spectators was immense. It was one o'clock in the afternoon on June 17th. Li was taken from the Army Prison and tied to the West Great Bridge for execution by shooting. Li's expression did not change, and he described his purpose in joining the righteous army, saying, ("I am neither a bandit nor a thief. I am a true Chinese and cannot bear to see our territory fall to foreign races. To wipe away the nickname of 'slaves of a fallen nation' for our people, I joined the volunteer army. I am willing to die so that the Wokou know that the hearts of our people have not died, and the Chinese nation can never be subdued by the pressure of power. My death is for the Republic of China. I hope my compatriots will become angrier with each setback and continue to strive.")</p>
<p>When Li saw that the executioner was Wang Shutang, the commander of the supplementary regiment, he shouted, ("Wang Shutang, Zhang Wenzhu, Cheng Zhiyuan, you are also serving your country, but I cannot say which country you are serving!") After the execution, all the spectators shed tears, but the execution soldiers, on their way back to camp, still loudly sang the military song ("The Yellow race should enjoy the Yellow Sea rights, Asians should cultivate Asian fields, youths, youths, do not engage in fratricide"), revealing the ignorance of the soldiers.</p>
<p>On June 16th, Cheng Zhiyuan appointed the Japanese Niwakawa as the Director of the Police Department and Inada Ichiro as the Director of the General Affairs Department. It is reported that the Japanese have finalized a plan to resettle veterans in the Northeast, confiscating uncultivated wasteland and evicting tenant farmers from their land for the veterans to cultivate, with every hundred families forming a village. They have already sent people to various places to investigate soil quality and products, and it is planned to temporarily move 50,000 veteran households to Heilongjiang this year.</p>
<p>The Qiqihar-Keshan Railway Bureau was terminated on June 15th and taken over by the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway Bureau. The Japanese have recruited 3,000 workers to work day and night to expedite the construction of the section from Aolonggou to Keshan on the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway. It is scheduled that the section from Aolonggou via Keshan to Kedong County will be connected to the Qiqihar-Hailun Railway by September 1st. The Japanese are actively repairing the section from Laha Station to Nehe on the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway, which is ninety li long, for the convenience of military movements. It is scheduled to be completed this month.</p>
<p>On June 17th, Cheng, the traitor, executed a Marshal Ma's regiment commander Li Rong. On June 18th, the Japanese army dispatched the Koizumi Detachment to attack Ma's army in the direction of Nehe. Ma's army's Xu Zihe Brigade has already retreated from Nehe to Nenjiang. According to a person from Keshan County, it was captured by the Red Spear Society on June 20th. Over twenty Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and they soon withdrew. The county magistrate and the director of the Public Security Bureau have both disappeared. Currently, the Japanese army is demanding one hundred horse-drawn carriages from each county, and the people cannot afford to supply them and are fleeing. Those with guns and youths, unable to withstand the various oppressions of bandits, are secretly planning to risk their lives. No one is cultivating the fields more than ten li outside the city in each county. There are concerns that there will be a grain shortage after the autumn harvest. Bandits are everywhere in the counties, bandits and soldiers are indistinguishable, and the old, the young, men, and women are helpless and fleeing in all directions. The Nenjiang River has overflowed and flooded over a thousand villages and towns. The scale of the flood has not been seen in nearly thirty years. Between natural disasters and human calamities, the people truly do not know where their death will be. (July 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Hebei Provincial Government Report <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Tragedy at Baoding Second Normal School</p>
<p>▲Students Refuse to Accept Takeover, Leading to Conflict</p>
<p>▲Resulting in Six Student Deaths and Five Injuries</p>
<p>▲Baoding Area Now Under Martial Law</p>
<p>A dispatch from Tianjin states that the communist dispute at the Provincial Baoding Second Normal School has dragged on for many days without resolution. The Provincial Government, fearing further complications, telegraphed Ji Yuan County Magistrate Jing Jinliang and Baoding Public Security Bureau Director Li Enpei, ordering them to take over the school, with the county to manage the school's assets and temporarily close it until it could be reorganized and reopened. Unexpectedly, the Baoding garrison and the Public Security Bureau went to take over the school on the morning of the 5th, resulting in a conflict with the students, leading to six student deaths, five injuries, and thirty-eight arrests. Due to the seriousness of the matter, the Provincial Government convened the press on the 7th to report the incident and requested careful reporting. The details are as follows: The Department of Education believed that the Second Normal School's student unrest had taken on a political character, going beyond the scope of purely educational administration, and therefore submitted a proposal to the Provincial Government to resolve the issue, requesting the Provincial Government to handle it. The resolution was approved. The original proposal stated: "The Second Normal School students are occupying the school and resisting reorganization. We submit a proposal for handling it for public decision." Regarding the proposal: Upon investigation, it was found that the Baoding Second Normal School was involved in a communist dispute, and an order was given to investigate and deal with the matter. The school was first closed for a vacation for reorganization, and a reorganization proposal was submitted to the meeting. It was resolved to approve the measures proposed by the Department and strictly handle the matter according to the law, and reports were to be made. After receiving the order, Qingyuan County Magistrate Jin and Baoding Public Security Bureau Director Li were telegraphed on June 13th, stating that since the reorganization of the case had been resolved by the Provincial Government, all students were prohibited from entering the school before being summoned, and personnel were sent to take over the school. It was then reported that the Second Normal School students had defied the Department's order on the 15th of this month, illegally entered the school, and the situation was serious and impossible to take over. The Provincial Government also telegraphed the garrison in Baoding, requesting assistance in handling the matter. The Department also repeatedly telegraphed the political and police organs in Baoding, requesting strict precautions and joint action to quickly conclude the matter and carry out the reorganization. However, the students remained obstinate and occupied the school, resisting takeover. Members of the Department reported that the students had tightly closed the school gates, patrolled the school walls with guns, had bricks and tiles prepared, and did not allow civilians to enter, and they also occupied neighboring houses, demolishing two of them. On the evening of June 23rd, during a rainstorm, more than twenty people rushed out, each carrying knives and guns, and purchased ten bags of flour in the vicinity of the school. Furthermore, according to Baoding Public Security Bureau Director Li Enhou and Qingyuan County Magistrate Jin Liangji, they reported that they had received the urgent telegrams and that the Director and Magistrate had repeatedly and earnestly persuaded the students to no avail. In accordance with the telegrams of the Provincial Department, they consulted with the commander of the 14th Brigade of the Army to determine a困 method to soften them. Since June 23rd, over a hundred soldiers and police officers had been dispatched to surround the school, and the electricity and telephone lines were cut off to stop their news and cut off their communication. The students returned to the school and took advantage of the unpreparedness of the soldiers and police officers to break out twenty people to buy ten bags of flour into the school. It was estimated that with this supply, they could last another ten days, and the students were sending out declarations and arbitrarily scolding the outside, and they had stored many knives, guns, clubs, bricks, and stones to resist. Judging by their actions, it was not comparable to ordinary student unrest. The Director and Magistrate were deeply afraid of being too hasty and causing damage, so they delayed and failed to act quickly. Before receiving the telegram, they reported the reason and consulted closely with Commander Chen, believing that such a delay was not a solution. If force were used to expel them, a solution could be achieved quickly, but after examining the situation, it was determined that the students would resist, and once started, damage to both sides was inevitable. They hesitated again and again and dared not act rashly. They respectfully submitted the actual situation and requested investigation and approval on how to resolve the matter in order to follow. While reviewing the matter, the Department's members, Wang Jin et al., telegraphed, "The telegram has been received. After contacting the County Bureau, it was said that they had telegraphed the Fu and Ting to request instructions. Unexpectedly, during this period, the students in the school robbed ten bags of flour and two bags of white rice, and their arrogance was greater than before. It was heard that the stolen items were supplied by someone, and it was heard that there was indeed an organization of students outside the school. If it is not resolved early, the dispute may expand." According to these circumstances, it was found that the communist party was rampant in the school before, and the Department had a reorganization plan. Later, they received an order to strictly handle the matter, and personnel were repeatedly sent to handle it carefully. It was originally hoped that the reorganization would be completed in the shortest time, so a vacation was first granted to consider the students' departure and retention. At that time, only two students in the school were sick and had not left. After leaving the school, they re-entered the school, and after being surrounded, they were able to enter and exit, so that the students always resisted and refused to accept the takeover. Such gathering of people to resist orders is truly ignoring the law and discipline and cannot be tolerated again. It is proposed to dissolve the school and temporarily close it, and to adopt the measures of closing the Baoding Second Vocational School. All public property and official documents are to be received and kept by the Baoding Public Security Bureau Qingyuan County to facilitate cleaning. After the cleaning is completed in the future, it will be reopened. If this plan is adopted, please telegraph the Baoding Public Security Bureau Qingyuan County to handle it properly. Is this appropriate? It is proposed for public decision and implementation." Member and Director of the Department of Education Chen Baoquan, after the resolution of this case was approved, the Provincial Government immediately telegraphed the Baoding Public Security Bureau Director and the Qingyuan County Magistrate, ordering them to comply, with the general meaning being to strictly arrest the ringleaders, dissolve the coerced, and consider the severity of the situation to deal with it accordingly. However, when taking over the school, if the students resisted, they were only allowed to use wooden sticks and martial arts and were not allowed to open fire. After the Baoding Public Security Bureau Director and the Qingyuan County Magistrate telegraphed, they discussed the takeover measures and decided to dispatch soldiers of a 旅 長,派旅長陈部队 and police of a大队 from the保安队 to take over. On the night of the 5th, they had once consulted with the party headquarters, the Education Bureau, and the students' parents to persuade the students to leave the school, but to no avail. There was only one way to take over by force. At三时 in the前夜, they used撓鉤, 鐵叉 to dig open a corner of the school, and the soldiers and police officers poured in. The students were prepared and resisted with weapons. First, several shots were fired, followed by a dense fire of large guns, totaling over a hundred shots, which lasted for an hour before stopping. After investigation, six or seven students died from gunshot wounds, five were seriously injured, one student's right leg was blown off, his knee was炸裂, and it had to be sawed off. One student had a gunshot wound to the chest and his intestines were exposed, one student had a stab wound to the chest, and the remaining two students were injured in the legs. All were taken to Si Luo Hospital. The hospital, being charitable in nature, immediately performed emergency surgery. The blood was flowing, and the situation was extremely tragic. The remaining thirty-eight students were arrested, escorted into the city by soldiers and police officers, and detained in the playground of the Second Model Elementary School. At seven o'clock in the morning on the 6th, military police, political figures, sleeves, brigade commanders, public security bureau directors, county magistrates, etc., all went to the school by rickshaw to investigate. They then inspected the soldiers and police officers under their command, who were all unharmed. All the parents were panic-stricken and in a state of great pain, rushing to the school to inquire. Furthermore, according to relevant sources, they received a report stating that many communists were lurking in the Baoding Second Normal School, wantonly luring young people and inciting unrest. Recently, the authorities in Beijing and Ping have received numerous reports that the communist bandits were hiding weapons in the school, intending to start an uprising in Baoding, using the Second Normal School as a base for launching the uprising. Therefore, they issued an order to dissolve the school to prevent the situation from escalating. Unexpectedly, the students of the school were incited by the communist bandits, tightly closed the gates, and confronted the soldiers and police officers. The two sides were in a standoff for four days. This morning (the 7th), at around nine o'clock, dozens of gunshots were suddenly heard from the rear wall of the school. While the soldiers and police officers stationed outside the school were surprised, they saw many bandits lying on the school walls, shooting outwards with box cannons and handguns. The soldiers and police officers were caught off guard and immediately one person was killed and seven or eight were injured. At this point, the soldiers and police officers also opened fire in retaliation, intending to forcibly enter the school and search for the communist bandits. Unexpectedly, the communist bandits mixed in with the student ranks, rushed out with guns, and stabbed the soldiers and police officers with knives and kitchen knives. The soldiers and police officers also fought back with bayonets. In this melee, a total of six young men were killed by the soldiers and police officers, and five or six were also injured. The school authorities are currently identifying the bodies. It is said that most of the dead were ultra-leftist elements who had recently come to study. As for the soldiers and police officers, as of the time of the report, four had died and twelve were injured. Martial law has now been declared in the Baoding area. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Hunan Province Establishes <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Military Expenditure Reorganization Committee</p>
<p>▲Specifies Monthly Military Expenditure Amount to be Paid by National Tax Agencies</p>
<p>▲Minimum Amount is 1.2 Million Yuan</p>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha states that the Fourth Route Army's military expenditures have been traditionally covered by Hunan Province's national tax revenue. Since the occurrence of banditry and floods last year, tax revenue has decreased, and military expenditures have been in arrears for five months (only food has been issued, and officers and soldiers have not been paid). This year, austerity measures have been strictly enforced, and payments have been issued at 50%, 60%, and 80% of the original amount, with monthly dual fees reduced to 1.2 million yuan. However, due to the shortfalls in salt tax and the lack of special tax revenue, the military expenditure for June has not been fully paid, and the food for July is not secured. He Jian now believes that it is at a time when the suppression of bandits is tense and funds are urgently needed. If measures are not taken to reorganize and enrich the source of funds, it will be difficult to maintain the situation. Therefore, the day before, he convened the managers of various divisions and the heads of national tax and financial agencies to discuss rescue measures and decided to establish a Military Expenditure Reorganization Committee to bring together managers of various divisions and heads of national tax agencies to jointly discuss reorganization and enrichment methods. At that time, eleven articles of organization regulations were drafted, and He Jian appointed Huang Weihan, Ling Zhang, Tai Shiding, Wang Han, Xie Qi, He Zhiwen, Liu Yunsheng, Chen Qingguang, Hu Zhaoyuan, Yi Fengteng, Yang Daguan, Zhang Ganqun, Gui Runsong, Jiang Guozhang, Huang Huiseng, Li Yi, Zhang Yuzhou, Wang Jiading, Chen Rujin, Wang Shijian, Tang Zanyu, Xie Jizhen, and Chen Gubang as members, and appointed Liu Yinggu as the chairman of the committee. The inaugural meeting was held at the Fourth Route Army headquarters on July 8th, and the committee stipulated the amount of military expenditure that each national tax agency should pay each month. The Customs Transportation Bureau and the Audit Office should pay 900,000 yuan per month, the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Bureau should pay 90,000 yuan per month, the Cigarette and Kerosene Special Tax should pay 60,000 yuan per month, and the Special Tax Office should pay 150,000 yuan per month, totaling 1.2 million yuan as the minimum amount. If there is a large amount of special tax revenue, it will be used to clear arrears. However, in any case, 1.2 million yuan must be paid each month according to the above ratio, so that there will be no shortage of salaries in the future. The regulations of the Military Expenditure Reorganization Committee are recorded as follows: (Article 1) This Route Army has specially established the Military Expenditure Reorganization Committee in order to enrich military expenditures and ensure the authenticity and transparency of income and expenditure. (Article 2) The members of this committee are organized by the following personnel: 1.

The Chief of Staff shall be the Chairman of the Committee, and the Chief of the Management Department shall act as the Chairman when he is absent due to work. (Article 3) This committee is responsible for supervising, assessing, planning, and reorganizing the income and expenditure of the military expenditure of this Route Army based on the following principles: (1) The expenditure of the military expenditure of this Route Army must strictly adhere to the budget.

<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that various counties in this province were previously flooded with paper money, with no restrictions. After the Provincial Government strictly banned them, they were completely prohibited. Since the establishment of the Ping 市 Official Money Bureau, 500,000 yuan of 角 Notes have been issued to facilitate the circulation of people's trade (200,000 yuan circulated in Jinan, Weixian, Jining, Tengxian, and Linqing, 160,000 yuan circulated, and 140,000 yuan circulated in Qingdao, Yantai, Longkou, Zhoucun, Boshan, and Tai'an). For more than a year now, the credit has been quite good. Recently, Wang Tengjiao, the manager of the Bureau, believed that the previously issued 500,000 yuan was only sufficient for circulation in the above-mentioned places, and planned to continue issuing 1 million yuan (600,000 yuan for two 角 notes and 400,000 yuan for one 角 notes) for distribution throughout the province. After submitting a request to the Department of Finance for review, Wang Xiangrong, the Director of the Department of Finance, immediately submitted it to the Provincial Government meeting for discussion. As a result, it was passed as it was. The document submitted to the Provincial Government is recorded on the left: (According to the report submitted by Wang Tengjiao, the manager of the Shandong Ping 市 Official Money Bureau, the Bureau's previous printing of 500,000 yuan of 角 Notes, the city needs about 200,000 yuan for circulation, Weixian, Jining, Tengxian, and Linqing need about 160,000 yuan in total, and Qingdao, Yantai, Longkou, Zhoucun, Boshan, and Tai'an need about 140,000 yuan in total. The printed 角 Notes are only sufficient for the application of the above-mentioned places, and it is proposed to continue printing 600,000 yuan of two 角 Notes and 400,000 yuan of one 角 Notes, totaling 1 million yuan, for distribution and application. The China East Printing Bureau, which printed the 角 Notes last time, is about to finish, and it is ordered to continue to undertake the work. The machinery is complete, and the workers are skilled. Not only can the printing cost be saved, but the completion date will be faster. If approved, the value will be negotiated with the Bureau again, and a contract will be signed. Please check and instruct, etc. Based on this, it is found that it is now the time to unify the currency system in the province and ban private paper money issuance. The 500,000 yuan of 角 Notes printed by the Bureau are not sufficient for use, and it is necessary to continue printing and issuing them. It is proposed to approve the printing of 1 million yuan of 角 Notes for circulation. It should be submitted for check and instruction, etc. Whether it should be approved or not, please make a public decision.)</p>

<p>▲ Epidemic Prevention Work on Donghou Mountain: The Dengshan Hospital, founded on this mountain, has been in operation for five years and has achieved remarkable results. Every summer, it increases the number of temporary epidemic hospitals. This summer, due to the aftermath of the Battle of Shanghai, epidemic outbreaks are inevitable. Hospital Director Yan Jingru, together with Western-trained doctor Shi Ruxin, have been administering preventative vaccines.

The County Chamber of Commerce was instructed to investigate and report back. According to the reply, the Suzhou price of small change fluctuates in accordance with Shanghai. Even if all industries are harmed by the small change price, it is the result of market conditions. The Suzhou money changers have no intention of deliberately suppressing the price. The County Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance for review on the 9th.</p>

<p>▲ Water and Land Robberies Occur Frequently: Meng Dabao and Meng Xiaobao, brothers residing in the 31st of the Thirteenth District (Xinan Township), Gengli Bridge, Taiping Township in the county, were farmers with modest means. At approximately 11:00 PM the night before, over twenty robbers suddenly arrived, wielding wooden sticks, sharp knives, hemp ropes, and other weapons. They broke down the door and dragged Meng Dabao and others from their beds, tied them up with ropes, forbade them from making any noise, and proceeded to loot the house, stealing gold and silver jewelry, furs, clothing, and other items worth approximately 200 yuan. Before leaving, they stabbed Meng Dabao several times with a knife, causing profuse bleeding. Meng's wife, Zhou, was stabbed in the thigh and foot. His sons, Genxiang and Fengxiang, sustained minor injuries. Meng Xiaobao and his son, Meng Wenxiang, were also beaten and injured. After receiving the report, Zhu, the patrol chief of the Third Sub-Bureau of the Eighth Public Security Bureau, immediately led police officers to investigate and arrest the robbers, but they had already fled. It is reported that when the robbers arrived at the alley, they forced Feng Jin, Ding Rengui, Yang Jichang, and others who worked at nearby wine and medicine shops to lead them to Meng's house. There are likely to be clues to be found. Furthermore, a Changxueban barge, traveling from Changzhou to Xue, was robbed of four or five hundred yuan by a pirate ship on the night before when passing through the Fangzhuang Bridge area of Qi. The boat owner, Shi Xiuquan, came to the city yesterday to report the robbery to the county and request an arrest. Also, a series of robberies have occurred on the roads near Bantang Temple in the Sixth District. Li Junqing, the patrol chief of the police station of the Twelfth Sub-Bureau, arrested six bandits: Jiang Guirong, Sun Guilin, Sanlang, Wang Aisheng, Tan Tianyuan, and Lü Xigen. They were handed over to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Young Woman Commits Suicide Due to Poverty: A village woman, Wu, from Wu Jiaqiao in the Second District (Jingyun City), was destitute and owned only two mu of ash fertilizer fields. Her husband died early, leaving behind a son named Arong, who worked as a mason. Over ten years ago, she remarried Zhou Apei from Zhouxiang Village in a neighboring village. When Apei entered the Wu family, he brought his own fields with him. Soon after, they had a son and a daughter. Four or five years ago, Apei arranged for Arong, the son from her previous marriage, to marry Hua, a woman from Zhangtang Bridge. Although they were not formally married, they lived together. However, the Wu family was not wealthy and had very limited funds. A month ago, Hua owed a piece of summer cloth and asked Arong for money to repay the debt. Arong promised to pay it after he received his wages from a certain household. However, his mother had taken the wages. A quarrel broke out between the mother and son. Hua, witnessing this, felt hopeless and thought the future was bleak. On the morning of the 7th, at 8:00 AM, she entered her room and hanged herself. When her family discovered her, it was too late. Afterwards, Hua's family rushed to the Wu family to negotiate, demanding that she be buried in an elaborate coffin. The Wu family only had two sheng of rice and two yuan left. They did not know how to cover the expenses. The body had not been placed in a coffin as of 4:00 PM on the 8th, which is truly tragic.</p>

She has a child bride, Shen Fumei, who is currently 12 years old. She was brought from her hometown when she was nine years old and has been frequently abused. Recently, because the school has started summer vacation, Huang, who is fond of movies, returned from watching a movie at the Chengzhan Cinema on the evening of the 8th. It is unknown what made Huang angry on her way home, so she vented the anger on the child. First, she cursed, and then she ordered her to retrieve an item she couldn't find. She then tied up her hands and feet with a rope, stuffed her mouth, and beat her severely with a wooden object for two hours. The girl was unable to scream and rolled on the floor, resulting in more than fifty injuries all over her body. The next morning, neighbors saw the sight and were outraged. They reported the incident to the police, who arrested Huang and sent her to the court. Prosecutor Zhou Zhaozhi interrogated her. Huang confessed that she had drunk too much alcohol and hit her a few times. Shen Zhumei confessed the horrific details of what happened, and her voice was filled with tears.

<p>▲ Police Attempted Fraud, Leading to Death: Li Maosheng, a partner at Zhou Xingzhen Bingdian Store in Yuyao, was returning from a Shahong gambling session at approximately 2:00 PM yesterday, carrying 210 yuan in cash. This was secretly reported to Mao Zhongyuan, a plainclothes policeman from the Fifth Branch of the county. The policeman went to Haidian Village, hoping to profit from the situation. Soon after, he saw Gao approaching with a moneybag. The policeman stepped out to intercept him. Gao, seeing the unfavorable situation, immediately ran away. The policeman chased after him, pursuing him to the Yejiatangtou area. Gao, with nowhere to escape, jumped into the river. The river was deep and the water swift, and he drowned. The villagers, seeing this, were furious and detained Mao Zhongyuan, reporting the incident to the village office, which transferred him to the county government. Gao's family, upon hearing the news, accused the policeman of murdering for profit and filed a lawsuit with the county court.</p>

<h3 id="e97">On Summer Vacation Homework: Ya. <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Summer vacation is the golden time for students. During this time, they can get closer to nature and expand the walls of the classroom to all aspects of society. They can not only learn from lively things but also try to do what they love in the real society. Unfortunately, during summer vacation in our country, due to excessive indulgence after separation from family and the disruption of a relatively structured life, there is an increase in the chances of illness and death.</p>
<p>The summer vacation of the 21st year is coming. This is the first summer vacation nearly ten months after the loss of the Northeast and nearly half a year after the Shanghai disaster. During this month, most male and female students will embark on their summer vacation journey home.</p>
<p>What to do during summer vacation? This is what every student should ask themselves before rolling up their bedding. I will introduce a few suggestions to everyone.</p>
<p>(1) Deeply Imprint the Scars of National Crisis on the People: You still have to skip classes to give speeches at school. Now is the best opportunity. Students above the middle school level can gather comrades to start summer schools or training classes in various villages to promote awareness of the national crisis and improve farmers' knowledge. (2) Investigate Enemy Goods in Detail: Thoroughly investigate the names, quantities, transportation methods, and main stores selling enemy goods in various places, and find ways to boycott them. (3) Travel to Various Places: Within the limits of economic possibility, everyone should travel to various places. This is lively education and very beneficial. (4) Try to Make Various Specimens: Such as local agricultural products and all kinds of animals and minerals. If specimens can be made and everyone brings them together after the summer, it will definitely help teaching.</p>
<p>(5) Get Close to Nature: The physical fitness of students in our country is generally not very healthy, and there are even more psychological health deficiencies. This is especially harmful to students in cities. This originally concerns economic, political, and social aspects, but being too isolated from nature is a major reason. Everyone should take advantage of the summer vacation to go to the countryside and the forest to awaken from confused dreams and sorrows and lead life to a more pleasant and easy path.</p>
<p>(6) Review or Preview Lessons: Make a general review of past lessons or try to preview future lessons. Everyone knows this is beneficial.</p>
<p>The above are just some of the larger points of summer vacation homework that everyone can do, but to achieve considerable results, the following two points are very important:</p>
<p>(1) Maintain a Relatively Structured Life: Irregular eating and sleeping habits not only hinder summer vacation homework but also greatly impair health, especially in the summer.</p>
<p>(2) There Must Be No Exceptions: Things that should be done at a certain time and things that should not be done must not be an exception for special reasons. If there are exceptions, everything is over.</p>
<p>Young students, do not let sleeping, gluttony, and indulgence attack you again during the 21st year summer vacation. I hope you happily accept the arrival of the summer vacation and make progressive use of the long summer vacation. To do this, you must first have a work plan.</p>

<p>Zheng Yu Wins Championship</p>
<p>▲ Defeats the two Guos in straight sets</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Tennis Club's open doubles championship concluded yesterday. Young players Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang defeated Guo Qida and Guo Pengnian 7-5, 6-0, 6-3 in the final. The championship was won by Zheng and Yu. After the game, the silver cup was awarded by tennis veteran Hu Yun. The referee was Lin Baohua.</p>
<p>▲ The two Guos seize the initiative. The competition began at four o'clock under the gaze of a few spectators at the Chinese tennis court. The two Guos won two games in a row, showing a strong momentum to seize the initiative. Then, with a 5-3 lead, they had a superior situation. However, Zheng and Yu did not be discouraged, and calmly advanced, winning four games in a row, reversing the situation to win 7-5.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng and Yu take the prize easily. In the second set, the two Guos were at a loss. Zheng and Yu completed six games in one go, ending the set. In the third set, the two Guos failed 3-6 despite Zheng and Yu's mediocre playing style.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng and Yu excel at net play. Among the four players, Zheng Zhaojia performed the best. His forehand and backhand shots are sharp and extraordinary. And Zheng and Yu's net play is quite skilled, which is a major problem for their opponents. Guo Qida is known for his calmness, but he is not good at dealing with fast balls, and Guo's slow balls just suit Zheng and Yu's tastes, giving them a chance to create a masterful performance. Guo Pengnian's performance was mediocre, making Guo feel that he was unable to support the game alone.</p>

<p>The price of silver bullion fluctuated greatly last week.</p>
<p>New highs appeared for three days at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>Selling pressure was strong at the end of the week, and the price plummeted.</p>
<p>The price of silver bullion fluctuated drastically last week, with turbulent waves and daily fluctuations of more than ten taels. The situation was confusing and unstoppable. It opened at a surge of 10 taels and 1 qian at the beginning of the week, breaking through 760 taels, a total of 63 and a half taels. This was because the silver market had shrunk due to bank closures after the settlement and holidays. Subsequently, the local foreign exchange market also tightened, and large short positions rushed to cover, so the price frequently rose sharply, advancing straight ahead without looking back, rising sharply for more than 20 taels in three days, and suddenly reaching a new high of 780 taels and 8 qian. On Thursday, the rising trend began to subside, and the price fluctuated slightly around 770 taels. However, it was heard that the Lausanne Conference would have a signed resolution, people's hearts turned downward, and the market turned from strong to weak. Selling pressure surged, causing a sharp drop of more than 20 taels. At the weekend, it suddenly broke through 760 taels, totaling 58 taels. There were also reports that Lausanne had signed an agreement. The final closing price was 61 taels and 4 qian. In these six days, there was a retracement of 22 taels and 8 qian, and the overall comparison was still up 8 taels before the closure (June 30) (already up for five consecutive weeks, about 40 taels). As for the London and New York silver markets, there was a slight rebound. The local foreign exchange market was quoted at a par for shillings and a continued reduction of 25 cents for US dollars, but there was no glory or disgrace within the banks. The exchange rate has rebounded after falling for four consecutive weeks. It is estimated that the exchange rate is one point for British against US, and 9375 for US against British. The daily transaction volume of British and American exchange rates in the gold industry is quite prosperous, but there are many differences in arbitrage, and most of them are hedging. The settlement price is 67 taels, with a daily difference of 10 taels. The spot bare price was initially increased by about 10 taels, and later saw a low of 7 taels and 7 qian 5 fen. Each number's August chips are estimated to be about 20,000 pieces. Daily trading is more agile than in the previous two weeks, but the two sides of the long and short sides sometimes have a double-sided control trend. The high and low prices of silver market drafts during this week are listed below for reference 5.</p>

<h3 id="e117">The Phenomenon of Continued Appreciation of Foreign Silver in the Solitude of Sunday <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The financial industry during this hot summer season is usually a dull period. This time, the government's use of the foreign silver standard has attracted special attention, and various market conditions have mostly erupted, especially the price of foreign silver is the most important, and the increase is also the most significant. Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were not trading as usual, but the competition for the price of silver in the market continued to rise. The early market was 6 qian 9 fen 4 li half, which seemed to be 1 li and a half higher than the early market the day before. The afternoon market was slightly softer at 125, at 6 qian 9 fen 4 li 3 hao 7 and a half, resulting in an increase of 1 li 375. Silver borrowing, on the other hand, fell back by a small 3 fen, only 3 fen, with the same price in the morning and afternoon. The amount of exchange bills made was limited in the early market, only 425,000, and 740,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 40,000 in the early market and 100,500 in the afternoon market. Qianzhuang Foreign Public Sheet collected and delivered 4.89 million, and Silver Public Sheet collected and delivered more than 21 million. The transaction of borrowing bills in the two markets was more than 5 million, and the transaction of small Qianzhuang was more than 500,000. The price of Jiangnan small silver was 6 qian 07 li in both the morning and afternoon markets, a drop of 3 li compared to the afternoon market the day before. The transaction was only 3,000 jiao in the early market. The price of Guangdong small silver was 5 qian 8 fen 7 li in the morning market and 5 qian 8 fen 7 li 2 hao half in the afternoon market. The transaction was 85,000 jiao in the morning market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were still 425,000 wen, with no difference from the day before. The transaction was 40,000 plus several hundred strings.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Securities: The Bond Market Was Very Quiet Last Week <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲ Prices were also extremely sluggish, with mutual ups and downs compared to the previous period</p>
<p>The market situation of the local Chinese Securities Exchange during the past week (from July 4 to 9) was that, after just settling accounts, business needed to be reorganized, and the situation and diplomatic situation had not improved. The popularity of major investors showed no signs of recovery, and even sporadic transactions were not many. Therefore, the market was very clear. The spot market only traded 149,500 yuan in the whole week, including 25,000 yuan of 96 public bonds, 1,000 yuan of 20 customs, 17,000 yuan of customs duties, 13,000 yuan of consolidated tax, 12,000 yuan of 20 volumes, 10,000 yuan of 19 customs, and 78,000 yuan each. Futures were 2.34 million on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday, and 1.67 million yuan on other days, totaling 12.455 million yuan. The clarity of the market was rare, as the turnover in the past was more than double that of this time. The internal salt tax was 2.68 million yuan, the consolidated tax was 2.27 million yuan, the 20 customs was 1.825 million yuan, the 20 volumes was 1.475 million yuan, the 19 good was 1.125 million yuan, the disarmament was 1.165 million yuan, the 19 customs was 850,000 yuan, the disbandment was 655,000 yuan, the customs duty was 180,000 yuan, the organization was 600,000 yuan, the six-percent organization was 195,000 yuan, and the 96 public bonds were 35,000 yuan. Although the August futures have been open for many days, the entry and exit are extremely rare, with a total of only more than 300,000 yuan for various bonds. As for the changes in the prices of various bonds during the past week, the ring was dull, the demand was very flat, and the price was always in a state of rotation, resulting in the fact that the exchange's futures reserves were not large, and investors were unwilling to make large-scale sales at this time, while the sellers were also very flat due to the market and had concerns, and did not dare to sell short at low prices. The financial industry, even more, was unwilling to sell off and suppress the market price. This is why the market has always been very flat, and the bond prices are often trapped in sluggishness and difficult to have large fluctuations. After observing the changes in the past week, the market trended upward on Monday, and fell back on Tuesday and Wednesday. After that, there were mutual ups and downs. As a result, compared with the previous week, except for a few August futures that rose more sharply, the remaining mutual ups and downs were only about half a yuan. The bond market situation is likely to be temporarily trapped in a sluggish state.

<p>The yarn market fluctuated greatly last week.</p>
<p>Started rising and then falling... spot demand is strong.</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market was very fierce at the beginning of last week, and people's hearts were fluctuating. Due to the poor climate of American cotton and serious pest news, raw cotton rose sharply, driving the yarn market. Both the long and short sides had considerable strength, so the market fluctuated more and more, suddenly high and suddenly low, making people fall into a fog. At the same time, the Yunnan and Guangdong gangs in the southern port searched for spot yarn in the market, and the July and August goods of some yarn factories were all absorbed. On Tuesday, American cotton suddenly rose 30 points, breaking through the 6-point mark. It was said that the Lausanne Conference had signed an agreement, and foreign prices might rise. Therefore, people's hearts were unusually sharp, and Rongxing's long side bought more when it fell. On Wednesday, the market trended tighter and the popularity was strong. The highest price of the October standard yarn was 147 taels. At the weekend, although the US cotton government's acreage report decreased, the market price rose slightly. Generally, large investors tended to sell short, and it was said that Japanese merchants were destroying everywhere in the rear. As a result, the selling trend suddenly became strong, and the market price turned down sharply. In short, the current situation has not yet entered a stable path, and there are still ups and downs. The customer gang bought a total of 23,281 packages of various yarns this week. The Yunnan, Guangdong, and Fujian gangs bought the most, and the other gangs rarely moved. The standard yarn was quite strong at the beginning of the week, but tended to be tired at the weekend. The result of each month was 23 qian higher than the price of the previous week. The total transaction volume of the whole week was 229,300 packages. The amount purchased by each gang is recorded separately below.</p>

<p>The cotton market was very sharp at the beginning of the week, with more buyers and fewer sellers, and the market was firm. The reason was that the report of American cotton pest was serious, and the situation tended to rise, which made people in this city optimistic, and generally major investors towed in to do more, so the market had a continuous rise and increase trend. On Tuesday, the American cotton telegraph came and rose 30 points, and the gold price also rose 20 taels. The hard atmosphere in the market was extremely fierce. The highest price of standard cotton was 32 taels and 7 qian. At that time, it was said that Japanese merchants bought 230,000 dan in the market, so the popularity became tighter and tighter, and some turned from short to long. At the weekend, although the government's acreage estimates were released less, the weather turned sunny, people's hearts turned tired, and the market suddenly fell by 89 qian. As a result, the price of standard cotton in each month rose by 23 qian compared to the previous week. There was still no import volume of spot cotton from this factory. It is said that Japanese merchants bought a huge amount. The transaction volume of standard cotton in one week was 593,400 dan. The source on the wharf was 2,490 packages of Yaohua cotton. American cotton fell 5 points compared to the previous week. The situation of the cotton market still needs to be shifted by American cotton.

<p>▲South Shanghai: Yesterday, approximately twenty ships arrived from various routes. There was a slight increase in warehouse stock. Sales in urban and rural shops remained sluggish. The Zhabei market was weak, and there was a large inventory. Sentiment was bearish. The price of both thick and thin japonica rice dropped slightly. Although the price of premium *lu yang* rice was sporadically affected by imported rice, the market became increasingly weak. Sales of low-quality *bian yuan* rice were thin and slow, and the market was generally stable.</p>
<p>▲Zhabei: Yesterday's rice market saw few deliveries from the west, and river inventories were still high. In terms of local transactions, due to the clear weather, buyers were hesitant. Regular and standard japonica rice, as well as Zhongguan rice, fell by one or two *jiao*. Premium imported rice was scarce, and the market appeared quite ordinary. Arrivals of *bian yin yuan* rice were weak, and sales were relatively good, keeping the market firm. Imported rice warehouses were very full, and customer demand was stagnant. Local sales were also thin, causing prices to continue to decline.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Sugar Market <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Raw Sugar Initially Fell, Then Recovered</p>
<p>▲Icing Sugar Very Popular at Opening</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's trading was quite active. However, buying interest was relatively calm, and offered prices were slightly lower. Sellers were willing to compromise, which slightly lowered market prices. Dutch sugar number 24 raw white was traded at 14 *liang* 4 *qian* 2.5 *fen*. Hong Kong sugar was traded at 14 *liang* 2.5 *qian*. Sugar in oil bags was 14 *liang* 2 *qian*. Dutch red sugar number 8 or 9 was 10 *liang* 7.5 *qian*. Raw sugar number 14 was 12 *liang* 1 *qian*. The market appeared stable. Taikoo sugar prices remained firm: B mark at 16 *liang* 3 *qian*, CW mark at 15 *liang* 8 *qian*, DY mark at 15 *liang* 5.5 *qian*. Tianjin-packed coarse-grained HM mark was 14 *liang* 7.5 *qian*, with lively trading. H mark was 12 *liang* 6 *qian*, PX mark was 11 *liang* 3 *qian*, with relatively dull demand. The market was steady. Local icing sugar was offered at 12 *liang*, and then 300-400 bags were traded at 11 *liang* 9.5 *qian*, making it very popular. Number 1 icing sugar was 16 *liang* 4 *qian*, number 2 was 16 *liang* 3 *qian*, with a bullish trend. Number 8 Dutch red sugar from Huaxin opened at 10 *liang* 6 *qian*, with an offering of 1,500 bags. Buyers were very interested, but their bid was 10 *liang* 5 *qian*. Negotiations were ongoing and no transaction had been completed.</p>

<p>A certain firm in the South Shanghai market rushed to transport over ten boxes of new Jinshan mushrooms the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they appeared on the market for the first time. The quality was not particularly high, but the quantity was small. Therefore, whole mushrooms were priced at 25 *liang* and flattened mushrooms at 32 *liang* 6 *qian*. If high-quality goods arrive in later batches, market prices will fluctuate.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Textiles: Woolen Fabrics Market Sales Sluggish <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Sales of woolen fabrics have been extremely sluggish recently. The hot weather has stifled actual demand. There are only sporadic sales in the local market, and buying interest from merchant guilds has gradually decreased. Because of a surge of fifty *liang* in remittance rates, the Sichuan merchant guild stopped making purchases. Overall, the atmosphere in the trade association was scattered. Both explicit and implicit prices were soft. Currently, Yongfeng 8686 *fanghua deng su bi ji* is selling for 2 *liang* 3 *qian* 2.5 *fen*, Ningfeng Pengshoutu is 3 *liang* 4.5 *qian*, and Gongping Sizi Gaosheng is 2 *liang* 4 *qian* 2.5 *fen*.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Disturbance at the North Railway Station Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>▲Over One Hundred Communists Demonstrating to Demand Reduced Prices</p>
<p>▲Shouting Slogans Explaining Noulens</p>
<p>▲More Than Twenty Apprehended</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 11:30, over one hundred communists converged at the North Railway Station, planning a demonstration. As a large group of communists was entering the station, two workers, Wen Kaifu from Qingjiang and Shen Asan from Hubei, both around thirty years old, were searched by Fifth District police officers stationed at the station entrance. They were found to be carrying communist leaflets demanding the release of the Noulens and threatening riots and bloodshed. They were immediately taken to the Fifth District Headquarters for questioning. It was learned that a large number of communists had already infiltrated the North Railway Station. As a precaution, the Fifth District authorities dispatched a large number of armed police officers to patrol the area around the station. Upon hearing the news, the Concession police immediately sent a large number of detectives in an armored car, parked at the intersection of Boundary Road and Kennaugh Road. The detectives patrolled the area from the intersection of Boundary Road and靶子 Road to North Zhejiang Road. Seeing the increased security, the communists gradually dispersed around 12:30. About forty communists remained inside the station. At 12:45, a Changshu-Shanghai passenger train arrived at the station. These forty communists mingled with the passengers, distributing communist leaflets, and shouting slogans such as "Down with imperialism!", "Oppose the arrest of the Noulens!", "Support the Soviet Red Army!", and "Release communist political prisoners!" They continued shouting as they exited the station. As they reached Boundary Road, Concession detectives arrested more than twenty. The rest managed to escape. To prevent a riot, the Zhabei military and police authorities dispatched the Second Battalion, led by Captain Liu Wanjun of the 8th Company of the Republican Road Security Force, with over one hundred security guards, to the area in front of the North Railway Station, from Baoshan Road to the Han Bridge, to maintain order at 3:00 in the afternoon.</p>

Please release them immediately out of humanitarian concern. Liu Yazi, Yu Dafu, Tian Han, Fang Guangshou, Hong Shen, Chen Wangdao, Mao Dun, Zheng Jianxi, Mu Mutian, Ding Ling, Xie Bingying, Shen Qiyu, and thirty-two others.

<p>Concerned About the Situation in North China</p>
<p>▲Telegraph to Fellow Villagers to Unite in Resistance</p>
<p>The Hebei Fellow Villagers Association sent a telegram to various organizations in Hebei Province (titles omitted): We have read the news from Nanjing in the Shanghai newspaper dated the fourth. The report stated that Rehe is in danger and North China is critical. It is difficult to avoid the Japanese invasion of Tianjin and Peking. We are terrified upon hearing this. Looking back, the loss of the Northeast has been over half a year in an instant, only because calls for help were unheeded. This has left thirty million people under the oppressive rule. Patriotic individuals who occasionally rise up are immediately killed. People are living cautiously and tolerating humiliation to survive. However, the avarice of the invaders has not ended and they are plotting to invade Tianjin and Peking. They want to enthrone a puppet emperor and take control of China. We, the fellow villagers from Hebei in Shanghai, witness the imminent loss of our homeland. We are saddened by the ignorance of officials and the death of patriotism. While the national crisis continues, shoddy goods flood the market. While the Northeast has not been recovered, the people act as if they have nothing to worry about. Do not think that because we have vast lands and a large population, we are safe. Be aware that in modern times, it is easy to destroy a country using scientific methods. The neighboring power is focused on aggression, while our court is solely concerned with power and position. At this critical moment, we hope our fellow villagers will quickly unite to save ourselves. We urge internal officials to awaken and dispatch elite troops to defend key positions. We resist external powers' aggression and boycott shoddy goods, cutting off the Japanese market in North China. If we are determined, there is a way to save ourselves. Observe the Battle of Shanghai, where the people of Southeast China enthusiastically resisted the enemy. With a single army, they resisted over a hundred thousand enemy troops for forty days. This proves that with unity and sacrifice, we can survive. If we remain unenlightened and miss this opportunity, then the cries of the people of the Northeast will remain in our ears. What more can the people of Annam, India, and Korea say? We present these anxious words with utmost urgency.</p>

<p>Monopolize Northeast Finance</p>
<p>▲Li Fangxin Discusses After Returning From the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>The finance of Northeast China has been in a state of chaos since the September 18 Incident. Recently, the Japanese have again used the puppet state to organize a central bank, which has resulted in the replacement of the previously existing local banks. These new banks have also issued paper money and silver coins to replace the currently circulating national currency. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency interviewed Li Fang, the former manager of the Bank of Communications in the three eastern provinces, who had just returned from the eastern provinces, to discuss the situation in detail. The following is a summary of the interview.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Currency Monopolizes the Eastern Provinces: The finance of the Three Eastern Provinces has been monopolized by the Japanese. In terms of the current currency system, the amount of Japanese gold coins in circulation is approximately 3 million yuan, and the amount of gold notes is approximately 130 million yuan. Forty percent of these gold notes circulate within Korea, and the remainder circulates in South Manchuria. Since the September 18th Incident, the amount of gold notes has increased by at least 10 to 20 million yuan, so the amount of gold notes circulating in the Eastern Provinces should be over 100 million yuan, worth approximately 150 million yuan in national currency. The amount of our national currency in circulation is approximately 60 million yuan in foreign currency issued by the six banks in Harbin, worth approximately 45 to 60 million yuan. The current silver dollars issued by the Fengtian Four Banks Reserve were approximately 4 to 5 million yuan after the Liaoning Incident, worth only 2 to 3 million yuan. The silver dollar notes issued by the Yongheng Official Bank in Jilin are worth approximately 7 million yuan. The silver dollar notes issued by the Heilongjiang Official Bank are worth approximately 12 to 13 million yuan. The exchange notes from various banks in Tianjin that have flowed into the Eastern Provinces are worth only 4 to 5 million yuan, for a total of 80 to 90 million yuan, which is about half the amount of Japanese currency and is entirely controlled by the Japanese.</p>
<p>▲Puppet Currency Usurps National Currency: After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese army seized control of financial institutions wherever they went. They have now established a puppet bank and announced unified currency measures. The currency unit is silver, with a purity of 23.91 grams of silver. The standard set by our country's currency regulations is 4 *fen* 8 *li* of Kuping pure silver, equivalent to 24.17 grams, which is a difference of eleven parts per thousand. Their intention is to prevent our country's currency from circulating in the Eastern Provinces. Because the people of the Eastern Provinces see that the silver color of our country's currency is better than that of the puppet state's currency, they use it at the same price, which is not cost-effective. Therefore, they will collect it or melt it down in batches to recast it, so that in the future, no coins made by our country will be seen in the Northeast.</p>
<p>▲Elimination of Financial Institutions: For the old currency of the Eastern Provinces, the Japanese have stipulated that except for the currency issued by the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, which may be used temporarily for five years, all other currencies must be withdrawn within two years and replaced with paper currency from the puppet central bank. The existing local banks, that is, the official banks in various places, have now been changed to branches of the puppet central bank, and will be completely and thoroughly changed within two years. In other words, they will be eliminated and reorganized by the Japanese. All old currency from official banks will only be maintained until the end of this year and will be cleared separately before being merged into the puppet central bank when the time comes.</p>
<p>▲New Paper Currency to Be Issued: After the establishment of the puppet central bank, it will be supervised and managed by the Japanese, and a policy of using paper currency to absorb cash will be implemented. A large number of banknotes will be issued and are currently being printed. They will soon be circulating in the puppet state. The Japanese are also preparing to mint silver coins, and they plan to repair the mint near the Shenyang Arsenal and then begin production.</p>
<p>▲Chinese Society Gives Public Lecture: The Chinese Economic Research Association invited Li Fang to give a lecture at the Chinese Society on Zanghaiwei Road yesterday on the financial situation in the Northeast. Many people attended the lecture.</p>

<p>Plans to Expand Air Defense</p>
<p>▲Improve Facilities and Training at Aviation Schools</p>
<p>▲Huang Bingheng Comes to Shanghai to Connect with Various Sectors</p>
<p>The Aviation Department recently launched a major plan to expand air defense. Lin Wojiang, legal commissioner of the department, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited him and received a detailed account of the expansion plan, which is summarized below.</p>
<p>▲Improve Aviation Schools: The Aviation Department's aviation school was initially established in Nanjing and has now been moved to Hangzhou. Its monthly budget is set at 500,000 yuan. The equipment and technical training are very rudimentary, hence the discussion to expand it. The Aviation Department plans to increase the monthly budget, expand enrollment, and hire more instructors. Recently, the National Government hired Colonel Jouett, an American aviation expert, and eleven others to go to Hangzhou to plan the expansion of the aviation school.</p>
<p>▲Increase Aircraft Purchases: The most elite of our country's aviation aircraft, the Northeast Flying Corps of over two hundred aircraft, were all seized by the Japanese after the September 18th Incident. The existing Central Flying Corps is not sufficient for national defense, so they plan to purchase aircraft from overseas in the shortest possible time and will implement this plan when the funding is available.</p>
<p>▲Huang Comes to Shanghai: The Air Defense National Salvation Association, organized by various sectors, is taking shape. Huang Bingheng, the director of the Aviation Department, came to Shanghai last night to discuss aviation matters with the association and plans to host a banquet today for Wang Xiaolai, Li Fusun, Wang Zhengting, and others to request their assistance with air defense matters.</p>

Present were 1,297 shareholders and representatives, holding 35,873 shares, representing 31,563 voting rights. The meeting began at 3:30 PM. Ding Feizhang was elected as chairman. The board of directors first reported on the destruction of the company and the handling of the aftermath. This included: the amount of losses, retained personnel, emergency relocation, handling of debts, collection of customer accounts, maintaining branch offices, preparing for the autumn book sales, providing relief to employees, dismissing some employees, clearing the general factory's post-disaster expenses, and preparing for reopening. Next, they reported on the company's operating status for the 20th year, stating that the total operations of the company were much better than the previous year and that the company had experienced more growth this year than in recent years. Unexpectedly, just as the closing of accounts began, the national disaster struck, causing significant losses and turning profits into losses, with a total loss of 3,471,283 yuan. They then reported the company's asset inventory. Afterwards, supervisor Zhou Xinbo reported on the inspection of the accounts. After the reports were completed, the board of directors' reports were adopted. Then, a motion was proposed to use the general reserve to offset the losses, stating that the total loss was over 3.47 million yuan and that the existing general reserve of over 1.33 million yuan would be used to offset the losses, resulting in a net loss of over 2.13 million yuan. This motion was passed. Subsequently, a proposal was made to reduce capital to 2.5 million yuan and amend the company's articles of association. After discussion, the chairman announced that because the reduction of capital and amendment of the articles of association were significant matters, it was decided that each shareholder would take the proposals back for careful study and that the board of directors would schedule a special shareholders' meeting to discuss them again. The election of directors and supervisors then took place. The elected directors were Xia Xiaofang, Gao Hanqing, Bao Qinglin, Zhang Jusheng, Wang Yunwu, Li Bake, Zhang Chanfen, Ding Feizhang, Gao Mengdan, Liu Zhanen, Ye Kuichu, Guo Bingwen, and Huang Hanliang, thirteen in total. Subsequently, Bao Qingjia, Wang Kangsheng, and Zhang Tinggui were elected with a majority. The elected supervisors were Xu Fengshi, Xu Jiquing, and Zhou Xinbo, three in total. Subsequently, Zhao Fuzhuo and Xu Yizhuang were elected with a majority. The meeting adjourned around 7:00 PM. It was also reported that the company's Shanghai General Distribution Office is scheduled to reopen on August 1.</p>

<p>Chinese Pharmaceutical Industry</p>
<p>Employees' Meeting Prevented</p>
<p>▲Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to Hold Emergency Meeting Today</p>
<p>▲Representatives from Hangzhou Returned Yesterday After Mediation</p>
<p>The labor dispute in the local Chinese pharmaceutical industry remains unresolved. The union has scheduled an emergency meeting for 1:00 PM today to discuss the direction forward. Yesterday's unemployment meeting was prevented by the authorities. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Unemployment Meeting Prevented: The delegation of unemployed workers in the pharmaceutical industry planned to hold a general assembly of all unemployed workers at the Yaowang Temple yesterday at 9:00 AM to demand that various employers find jobs for the unemployed. The First Section of the Third Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent police to prevent the meeting on the grounds that it had not been approved by party and government authorities in advance. The Pharmaceutical Workers' Union also attempted to persuade the workers to postpone the meeting, arguing that the general assembly of unemployed workers had not been approved by the full board of directors and supervisors. The unemployed members who attended the meeting appointed Yu Guiqing, Dong Kuizhang, Zhuang Yongfa, and three others to meet with Section Chief Jin Dianyuan, while also holding a meeting and electing Li Baokang, Chen Weiming, and Feng Shilin as chairmen of the presidium. They demanded that the union provide food and organize a fundraising team to petition the trade association within a certain timeframe. After being persuaded, they ended the meeting.</p>
<p>▲Representatives from Hangzhou Returned: A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday interviewed representatives Ye Zifang and Wang Yongjian from the Hangzhou Pharmaceutical Workers' Union at Zhenhua Hotel, Room 49. They said that, during this time of national crisis and internal unrest, they had repeatedly seen reports of increasingly large labor disputes in Shanghai, which was not a blessing for society. Recently, they also noticed that labor disputes had arisen in the pharmaceutical industry. Although it was only a dispute with one firm, Feng Cunren, the situation appeared to be escalating. Due to industry connections, their union decided to send them to Shanghai at their own expense, partly to comfort their fellow union members and partly to investigate the cause of the dispute, hoping to find an opportunity to mediate and achieve a peaceful resolution as a third party. They had heard that the Feng Cunren store owner had indicated a willingness to make concessions, such as paying each worker 50 yuan and providing compensation for strike losses. The mediators were willing to find a way to mediate, and the issue of replacement workers, as a whole, could be discussed by a joint committee. However, seeing that mediation was unlikely to be effective, they withdrew from the role of third party and sent letters to the union and trade association to bid farewell. They added that, in this era of social poverty and economic bankruptcy, strikes were not a blessing for society, so they did not want to rush to judgment and would only watch for the union's victory, which would also bring them joy. They were filled with emotion. It was reported that the representatives had left Shanghai and returned to Hangzhou last night.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Electricity Workers' Union Expresses Concerns <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reported that the Shanghai Electric Power Company previously fired a large number of workers, which aroused the resentment of all workers. Recently, it has continued to fire Ma Jinsheng and seven others, which has made the situation even more serious. The union sent a letter of warning to the company yesterday and issued an emergency declaration. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Emergency Declaration: The Shanghai Electric Power Company Workers' Union issued an emergency declaration yesterday, stating: "Fellow citizens, the harsh, cruel, and vicious treatment of our fellow workers by the Shanghai Electric Power Company has recently become indescribable. We have endured enough pain and can no longer tolerate it. Therefore, we must inform our fellow citizens of the true situation of the company's oppression and ask for your sympathy and assistance. Since the Shanghai Electric Power Company was sold by the Municipal Council to the current company, its oppressive and cruel treatment of workers has begun. First, it stripped us of all the rights we had under the agreement. Then, citing excuses such as business decline and reduced work, it fired a large number of our old and new factory workers. Although the union has repeatedly sent representatives to request reinstatement, the company has shown no sympathy and firmly refused. Even after party and government authorities sent representatives to negotiate, there was no significant effect. The unemployed workers are now suffering and have no one to turn to. All workers are deeply resentful. Recently, the company authorities continued to fire old workers such as Ma Jinsheng and seven others without reason. We cannot tolerate this constant and escalating attack on us. We are determined to fight the imperialist company with an indomitable spirit. If the employers continue to be unrepentant, then in order to protect our own interests and ensure the survival of all our fellow workers, we will take the most effective final action to deal with them. We hope that all our fellow citizens will give us guidance and practical assistance. We issue this declaration."</p>
<p>▲Letter of Warning: The Electric Power Company Workers' Union sent a letter of warning to the company yesterday regarding the unwarranted firing of workers, requesting a response within a specific timeframe. The original letter is as follows: "Dear Sir/Madam, this is to inform you that our members Ma Jinshan, Zhou Yunfu, Xu Genlin, and others have reported that your company fired them without reason on the 7th and 8th of this month. We were shocked to learn of this. When your company handled the takeover from the Municipal Council, it agreed that the rights of the original employees would remain valid and that employees could not be fired without reason. However, according to recent events, in addition to the 121 employees who have already been fired, which remains unresolved, you have fired seven more employees without reason. Our union workers are deeply resentful. After discussion by the union's full representative meeting, we demand that your company immediately reinstate Ma Jinshan and the other seven. Otherwise, we will not be responsible for any unexpected problems that may arise. Furthermore, if your company believes it has grounds for dismissal, it must inform us of the reasons within three days of receiving this letter. If our investigation finds that there were indeed mistakes, there will naturally be no problem. However, the 5% annual salary for pension must still be paid, and severance pay of six months must also be issued. We hope that your company will consider the workers' difficulties and resolve this dispute quickly and satisfactorily. This is of utmost importance. To the Shanghai Electric Power Company."</p>
<h3 id="e134">Silk Factories Reopened Yesterday Morning <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>▲Workers in the Zhabei District Fully Returned to Work</p>
<p>▲Few Workers Returned to Work in the Hongkou District</p>
<p>After the labor dispute in the local silk factory industry was resolved, all silk factories reopened yesterday morning. The Municipal Public Security Bureau sent police to protect the reopening. However, few workers returned to work in the Hongkou District. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Zhabei District: Fifteen silk factories in the Zhabei District, including Fengtai Shenji, Ruifeng Yuji, and Jiufeng Dingji, reopened at once yesterday morning in accordance with the trade association's notification. The Sixth District Silk Reeling Workers' Union sent council members Yuan Yunlong, Yang Gengdi, Wu Suzhen, Yan Aizhu, and others to lead all the staff to each factory gate to persuade workers to return to work. The Fourth Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent armed police officers to protect the reopening. By 6:00 AM, all the workers in the factories had returned to work.</p>
<p>▲Hongkou District: Ten silk factories in the Hongkou District, including Yichang Hou Furenji and Tongwei, reopened yesterday morning. The Fourth District Silk Reeling Workers' Union sent council members Zhu Xizhang, Le Xiaorong, and Chen Xiufu to each factory to persuade workers to return to work. The Third Section of the Fifth Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent police to protect the reopening. By 10:00 AM, only 20% of the workers at the Tongwei and Yujing factories had returned to work. At the remaining eight factories, including Yichang, Yuncheng, Chancheng, Renji, and Xinlun, 70-80% of the workers had returned to work. The union sent representatives again in the afternoon to persuade the workers, and it is expected that all workers will have returned to work by today.</p>
<h3 id="e135">French Electric Company Labor Strike Yesterday Report <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>▲Today the Municipal Government Continues Negotiations with the French Consulate</p>
<p>▲The Labor Union Presents Twelve Demands</p>
<p>After the strike of all employees in the machinery department of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company, the municipal government and the French Consulate are negotiating a solution. The labor union has presented demands, and citizens have already been affected by the strike. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Sunday Rest Situation　Yesterday was the fourth day of the strike. The strike committee decided, based on the resolution of the third strike committee meeting, to rest on Sunday. A special announcement was issued yesterday morning, stating: "Regarding the announcement, it has been resolved by the strike committee that July 10th (Sunday) will be a day of rest. All members are to comply. This is announced. However, members of the strike committee will still report to the office as usual. The picket line will continue to be on duty, with slightly relaxed vigilance. The iron gates of the company on Rue Lupan (Lu Ban Road) remain tightly closed, guarded by French Annamese and Chinese police for protection."</p>
<p>▲Citizens Already Affected　Since the strike of the machinery department employees, citizens in the French Concession have been affected. Activities such as installing water meters, electric meters, connecting electricity and water, and repairs have all been suspended. Public buses, trams, etc., in need of repair are unattended. Company meter reading and other tasks have been temporarily suspended. However, electricity generation and water supply are being maintained with difficulty by foreign workers.</p>
<p>▲Negotiations Continue Today　In order to quickly resolve the labor dispute at the French Water and Electricity Company, the municipal government sent Yang Shugeng and Ji Ji to negotiate with French Consul Mery. It is reported that they will continue to negotiate with the French Consul today (Monday). The Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau have advised the workers to wait patiently for a legal solution and to maintain order. The Strike Committee has accepted the advice and ordered its members to comply.</p>
<p>▲Labor Union Refutes Statement　The Chairman of the Strike Committee yesterday issued a rebuttal to Lu Guanhong's absurd statement, stating: "When the meeting was held on the 7th, a request was submitted to the party and government organs to send personnel to provide guidance and to have the picket line elected by the department meeting maintain order. There was absolutely no reason for non-members to infiltrate and disrupt the meeting. Lu Guanhong is colluding with the capitalists and selling out the interests of the workers. He actually made absurd remarks at the meeting and had his son Jinrong disrupt the meeting. Public sentiment was aroused, leading to his son being pulled away from his seat. Lu's gang then committed violence, resulting in the crowd injuring them. As for the confinement in a small room, representatives of the party and government organs witnessed it on the spot, leaving no room for denial." (The rest is omitted)</p>
<p>▲The Labor Union Presents Conditions　The Second District Water and Electricity Industry Union submitted a document to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating: "Regarding the submission of twelve conditions, we earnestly request that they be filed for record and that you promptly negotiate with the capitalists, ordering them to accept them. We have repeatedly submitted documents to your bureau and the Municipal Party Committee for mediation, which are on file. Since the capitalists have not provided a clear statement and have dismissed employees, causing public outrage and forcing us to resort to strike, it is truly unavoidable. Therefore, on the 8th, the general assembly of the masses, due to the stubbornness of the capitalists and driven by the need for food and clothing, has put forward the most basic and appropriate conditions. Including the previous case, there are a total of twelve items, namely: (1) Rescue Xu Amei from prison. The method is to request the capitalists to prove that Xu is not a communist, pay his wages during his imprisonment, and the capitalists must compensate for all expenses incurred during his imprisonment, such as lawyer fees and medical expenses. Reinstate him after his release from prison. (2) Reinstate Zhu Along and the other twenty-one people, and provide back pay for the period of suspension. (3) Reinstate Shao Ziying. (4) Restore the union's regular expenses to the original amount of two hundred yuan. Due to high rent, increased property taxes, and all kinds of miscellaneous expenses for the salaries of union staff, we feel that the expenses are insufficient. Therefore, in addition to the original amount of two hundred yuan, an additional three hundred yuan should be added, that is, the regular expenses must be paid at five hundred yuan from now on. (5) Pay wages as usual during the strike. (6) The capitalists should dismiss Lu Guanhong to appease the employees. (7) Pay each employee a monthly housing allowance of six yuan. (8) Increase the salaries of all employees, large and small, by 15% at the end of the year. (9) Issue uniforms to all employees inside and outside the factory. (10) The capitalists should reinstate the old contract. (11) The capitalists are not allowed to hire White Russians. (12) Employees who do not take leave for one month should receive an additional four days' wages. All members of our union believe that the above items are not excessive demands and have been passed on the spot. We are submitting this document for your bureau's record. We believe that your bureau has always taken it as its mission to solve the suffering of the people and seek the interests of the workers, and especially spares no effort to lead and support the workers. Therefore, we are submitting this document, hoping that you will promptly negotiate with the capitalists according to the above requests to benefit the labor movement. We are awaiting your orders." (The document to the Municipal Party Committee is omitted)</p>

<p>Chinese Employees Withdraw from the Labor Union</p>
<p>▲And Establish a Fellowship Association</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports: Chinese employees of the French Water and Electricity Company in this city suddenly withdrew from the labor union yesterday and established a separate employee fellowship association, announcing various reasons, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Declaration of Establishment of the Fellowship Association　We, all Chinese employees of the French Electric Company, since joining the labor union, have been blindly following the command of a few workers and passively dragged into the vortex of repeated labor disputes, without any so-called genuine will or freedom to express our will. We have come to the point where we dare not disobey any proposal made by the workers, whether reasonable or not. Even if we disagree, we are immediately whipped and beaten. All of us employees have always adhered to the principle of "more things done, more things go wrong". We have endured and followed, with our hearts and wishes far apart. We dare not hold any dissenting opinions, and we have no active or obvious actions. Through repeated endurance, our own will and freedom have been almost completely deprived by a few clamorous individuals. After thinking repeatedly, we have bravely risen up to organize a purely employee fellowship association to protect the genuine interests of all of us Chinese employees and to express our true will, so that we will not blindly follow and passively attach ourselves. As for the reasonable actions of our fellow workers, we will still adhere to our original intention and sympathize with and assist them. We hereby declare.</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Labor Union Declaring Withdrawal　Dear Sirs, we joined the labor union in July of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), originally to assist our fellow workers, based entirely on reasonable mutual assistance. In all the labor-management disputes that have arisen in the past, we have always sympathized with and cooperated with the workers. Although we dare not claim to have made contributions, we believe we can be acquitted of any wrongdoing towards our fellow workers. However, what we regret is that we feel that our positions and the workers' positions are slightly different, and our views are slightly different. Taking the current turmoil as an example, we also feel that the steps taken by the workers are slightly inappropriate. We believe that when the incident first occurred, we could have selected capable representatives to discuss the matter with the capitalists at length, or given the capitalists a reasonable deadline to respond within a longer period of time. As for strike actions, we should have reserved them as a last resort. For example, if two people have a dispute, how can they rashly resort to force? Is it not likely to lead to a stalemate? The current strike did not have the full consent of everyone beforehand. On the morning of the 7th, the day of the work stoppage, when the six representatives reported back, a large number of colleagues proposed to resume work first in the afternoon and wait for the representatives to continue negotiating with the capitalists until the 10th of this month. After all, the right to strike or not is in our hands. Even if we return to work now, if the capitalists do not give a reasonable reply by the deadline, we can start a strike again. Would this not have been a viable option? This proposal was not rejected on the spot. How can it be said that everyone agreed to it? Now that things are like this, what is done cannot be undone. What we should pay the most attention to is how to resolve the incident. After thinking repeatedly, we have the following requests: We are withdrawing from the labor union from today onwards. There are other reasons and statements, which will be published in the newspapers. Please pay attention. After this, although we are completely detached from the labor union, we can still actively assist in the event of sympathetic incidents, and even take concerted action. Not only that, now that we have withdrawn from the labor union, then in the future, whenever there are labor-management issues, whether they concern the workers or the employees, we can come forward as third parties to mediate. We feel that there is more room for maneuver in everything. Is this not the case? Furthermore, we are now establishing an association, and we will be conducting mediation of this dispute soon. If the workers as a whole or individuals have any opinions, please do not hesitate to share them with us, so that we can adopt them. This is what we hope for most.</p>
<p>▲Notice of Withdrawal from the Labor Union　We hereby respectfully inform you that the strike turmoil that occurred in the company this time was not with the prior consent of everyone, nor did it adopt the views of the majority after the event. It was entirely manipulated by a small number of people, fabricating public opinion and arbitrarily playing around. Even if someone disagreed, they were immediately beaten. There have been countless instances of beatings and scoldings in the past. This kind of behavior is something that all of us colleagues cannot condone. Whenever meetings are held, the venue is completely controlled by a few radical elements, making our employees silent and unable to express their will freely. This has led to all of us Chinese employees having no status in the labor union, except for bearing various nominal responsibilities. If it is said to be a work stoppage, then we can only follow suit. If it is said to be a strike, then we can only follow suit. If we are slightly more moderate or propose other ideas, we will immediately be whipped and beaten, or we will be labeled as capitalist running dogs and accused of sabotaging the labor movement. Repeatedly, all proposals made at meetings are radical, because no one dares to remain moderate anymore. If this continues, not only will our personal freedom and will be completely deprived, but we will inevitably be abandoned by society and suffer unjust grievances for a long time. Now, in addition to sending a letter to the labor union declaring our withdrawal, we are publishing this notice in the newspaper. Furthermore, our Chinese employees joined the labor union originally in July of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), originally to assist our fellow workers, based entirely on reasonable mutual assistance. We have also mediated labor-management disputes several times in the past, and we have always sympathized with and cooperated with the workers. Who knew that in recent years, we have become obligated and passive participants in the French Electric Company's labor disputes? Whenever the workers take any action, whether it is reasonable or not, we must follow suit, otherwise disaster will strike. Such official acquiescence is contrary to our will. If we do not withdraw quickly, where will we end up? We hereby declare the above and ask for the understanding of all sectors of society.</p>

<p>]H&lt;Fourth Sheet&gt;H[</p>
<p>If there are any actions taken by the workers, whether they are reasonable or not, everyone must follow suit, otherwise disaster will be immediate, and such a follow the crowd, run counter to the heart, if you do not rush to withdraw, where will it go? This is a special statement for the insight of all sectors.</p>

<p>Mr. Chu Minyi came to Shanghai this time to hold two important Sino-Belgian meetings: (1) the Sino-Belgian Health Construction Fund Committee, and (2) the Sino-Belgian Education and Culture Fund Committee. Both committees are affiliated with the Chinese delegation of the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee. Mr. Chu is the chairman of the congress. After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he convened the Sino-Belgian Health Construction Fund Committee at 2:00 PM. Commissioners Li Shizeng, Zeng Zongjian, Cai Hong, Song Wusheng, and Ge Chengzhi attended the meeting and resolved to establish a Sino-Belgian Venereal Disease Hospital. The committee will allocate 2,000 yuan per month from the fund to subsidize it. Cai Hong will be in charge of the hospital, which will be purely charitable in nature and will not charge consultation fees. Yesterday, Mr. Chu also convened a meeting of the Chinese delegation. Commissioners Chu Minyi, Zeng Zongjian, Zhu Shiquan, and Cai Hong attended the meeting. Song Wusheng, Nong Ruhui, and Tian Shoucheng attended as observers. It was resolved to organize the Sino-Belgian Education and Culture Fund Committee, with Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, Chu Minyi, Zeng Zongjian, Zhu Shiquan, and Song Wusheng as commissioners. Chu Minyi and Zeng Zongjian were designated as commissioners in charge of cultural funds, and the list of commissioners will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. After the meeting, Mr. Chu took the evening train back to Beijing that night.</p>

<p>Speech ("How to Save China")</p>
<p>▲At the invitation of the Chaozhou Fellow Provincial Association's Four Educations National Salvation Corps, at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Provincial Association's Four Educations National Salvation Corps specially invited Mr. Zhu Jiqing, a member of the Central Committee who had just arrived in Shanghai from the Northeast, to give a speech. More than 300 members attended the meeting. First, Chairman Zheng Zhengqiu gave an introductory speech, stating: "Mr. Zhu is a person who has contributed to the Republic of China. Whether in or out of office, he has never forgotten the revolution. He has a spirit of perseverance and a bright and great personality. He has returned from the Northeast this time and is familiar with the situation. This association has specially invited him to speak on the current situation and to guide the direction of national salvation. The significance of today's meeting is extremely important. We hope that everyone will earnestly strive and work hard according to Mr. Zhu's guidance." Next, Mr. Zhu Jiqing gave a speech entitled "How to Save China." (The long speech will be recorded separately) Next, Mr. Liu Houwu described the beginning and end of Mr. Zhu's trip to the Northeast to lead the people in their struggle, as well as his mission in Shanghai this time. Finally, the chairman delivered a speech of encouragement and dismissal. The following is Zhu Jiqing's speech:</p>
<p>The Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Provincial Association has always made great contributions to all aspects of the country and society. This time, it has organized the Four Educations National Salvation Corps to prepare for national salvation by cultivating the mind and body. Its profound intention is truly worthy of admiration. Three months ago, I went outside the customs to guide armed civilians in national salvation work. I saw the broken mountains and rivers and the tyrannical behavior of the enemy with my own eyes. I was already filled with infinite grief and indignation in my heart. This time, I returned to Beijing and Shanghai for business and had the opportunity to discuss the issue of national salvation with you. I couldn't help but feel happy again. This is because the compatriots outside the customs are struggling hard there for national salvation and are looking forward to reinforcements. You are here preparing for national salvation. Some people are fighting in the front, and some people are preparing in the rear. In this way, responding to each other from the front and rear and working together, there will definitely be a day when the lost land of the Northeast will be recovered, and the Chinese nation will not be destroyed. Isn't this a joyful thing? Speaking of the meaning of the two words "national salvation," it goes without saying that we know that the country is in danger and we must try to save it. There are many dangers in China now, but the most important one is the Northeast issue. The Northeast is to China as the brain and spinal cord are to the human body. If a person loses the brain and spinal cord, then that person will surely die. If China loses the Northeast, then China will surely be destroyed. Not to mention Japan's continental policy, which is not only to occupy the Northeast but also to annex the whole of China. Judging from the historical facts, China's external troubles since ancient times have all come from the north, such as the Five Barbarian Invasions and the Yuan and Qing dynasties' entry into the Central Plains. Therefore, if we want to save China, we must first save the Northeast. If we can save the Northeast, we can preserve China. Then, how exactly should we save the Northeast? I think you all know that the three words "non-resistance" have already created a big mistake, and expecting international sanctions is like a mirage, with no practical effect. In this situation, apart from using the strength of the nation itself to engage in long-term resistance, we cannot solely blame the government authorities or other aspects. Instead, all citizens must take responsibility. As the ancients said, "The rise and fall of a country is the responsibility of every individual." Since we, as citizens, cannot shirk our responsibility for the fall of the Northeast, we, as citizens, are of course duty-bound to recover the Northeast in the future. Moreover, the main reason for the arrival of national disasters lies in the fact that politics is not enlightened, and the main reason for the lack of enlightenment in politics lies in the absence of democratic forces. Therefore, if we want to fundamentally eliminate external troubles, we must make every effort to exert democratic forces, which will have a practical effect. The point of gathering armed civilians and organizing the Northeast National Salvation Army outside the customs is this. At the beginning of the September 18th Incident, the Japanese army occupied the lands of Liaoning and Jilin provinces within twenty-four hours. Afterwards, it encountered resistance from the people everywhere. It has been nine months now, and not only has it not been able to govern peacefully, but it is also exhausted. This shows how powerful the civilian armed forces are. At the same time, it is even more evident that only civilian armed forces can maintain the glory of the nation. As I just said, there is only one way to save the Northeast, and that is long-term resistance. When it comes to long-term resistance, there must be preparation for long-term resistance. However, this so-called preparation does not mean waiting for several or tens of years before resisting. It means resisting while preparing. Such a two-pronged approach, advancing simultaneously, being unyielding, and persisting to the end, then with China's vast land, large population, and abundant resources, I believe that it will be able to achieve final victory. On the other hand, if we wait for several or tens of years before resisting, then Japan, during those several or tens of years, can govern peacefully and create a deeply rooted situation. At that time, even if we want to resist, it will be too late, and I am afraid that it will not be easy to do. At present, the compatriots in the Northeast are fighting the enemy to the death in the front, so that Japan cannot get a chance to govern peacefully. As for whether they can persist to the end, it all depends on whether the compatriots in the rear can actively work hard to prepare and help them. Preparation can be divided into material and spiritual aspects. Material creation and invention depend on the role of the spirit, but for the spirit to play a role, it must also rely on the supply of materials. Just look at the anti-Japanese Northeast armed civilians. Their national spirit can be said to be fully expressed, but without material support, they cannot kill the enemy empty-handed. In this way, the spirit and matter are interdependent and cannot be separated. The name of your group is the Four Educations National Salvation Corps, and the purpose of your group is to cultivate the mind and body to prepare for national salvation. The so-called four educations are physical education, moral education, intellectual education, and social education. Physical education is to cultivate a healthy body, moral education is to cultivate noble morals, intellectual education is to cultivate rich knowledge, and social education is to cultivate the ability to work in groups. In other words, social education is to be sincerely united. You must use a healthy body, noble morals, rich knowledge, and sincere unity to save the country. There are more than 400 million people in China, including many with healthy bodies, noble morals, and rich knowledge. Unfortunately, they cannot be sincerely united, like a heap of loose sand, allowing national disasters to erupt uncontrollably. Therefore, in my opinion, you should put special effort into the item of social education and not only cultivate the mind and body but also engage in material invention or creation while cultivating the mind and body. Only in this way can you be considered a perfect preparation for national salvation. As for the situation in the Northeast, I have repeatedly published it in the newspapers in recent days and do not need to repeat it in detail. Now, I can only briefly summarize the situation in all aspects and say a few words. The Japanese army, having occupied our territory in the Northeast, destroyed our sovereignty and is still using various means of oppression to drive out our people, intending to completely turn the three northeastern provinces into Japanese colonies in name and in fact, and then annex the whole of China to implement its so-called continental policy. This is something that the people of the country should pay close attention to at all times. Although Japan has such sinister plans, it has been nine months since the September 18th Incident, and it has not had a chance to govern peacefully. Moreover, it has suffered several great difficulties. First, the Japanese army can only be stationed in various cities and along the railway lines and dare not leave ten or twenty miles away easily. If they leave, they are often wiped out by armed civilians. Second, since the incident, our country has suffered extreme trampling, and Japan has also suffered extreme losses. The headquarters of the Japanese invasion of the Northeast used to have an average annual income of 200 million Japanese yen, and the net profit was no less than 30 million Japanese yen. However, from April 1, 1932, to March 31, 1933, not only was there no profit to speak of, but there was also a loss of more than 3.4 million yuan. The South Manchuria Railway Company is still like this, and the rest can be imagined. Third, the Japanese government is suffering from economic downturn and heavy military spending, and its finances are already unsustainable. By the end of April, the shortfall in their national treasury's income had reached more than 100 million yuan. If this continues, how can they bear it? Moreover, Japan's occupation of the Northeast is not the will of all their citizens, but the arbitrary action of the warlords. In a certain sense, it is also a struggle between Japanese military power and civil rights. The Japanese civil rights movement has been growing stronger year by year. In order to maintain their special ruling position, the warlords do not hesitate to waste manpower and money, using the pretext of developing the country's power to occupy our Northeast and suppress our civil rights movement. This behavior of the Japanese warlords is tantamount to digging a grave for their country and throwing themselves on the road to decline. However, the length of their decline and the amount of sacrifice we suffer all depend on how hard our Chinese nation struggles. I sincerely hope that you will all become national salvation heroes, recover the Northeast, and preserve the whole of China.</p>

Attendees included Ji Yongxiang, Cao Zhigong, Gu Wensheng, Yu Hualong, Zhang Henghai, Zhang Yichen, Sun Mingqi, Wang Manyun, Yuan Hongjun, and others. Cao Zhigong was elected chairman and Zhu Yangwu as the recorder. The following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai Municipal Government's announced rent reduction measures violate the principles decided at the first convened meeting by the Municipal Government and disregard the facts, favoring landlords and making it difficult to call it fair.

<p>(2) It was decided to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters, presenting reasons for a speedy correction to comfort the public. Yu Hualong, Zhang Yichen, Sun Mingqi, and Gu Wensheng were elected as four representatives to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters tomorrow (today) at 1 PM.</p>

<p>Appeal from Fire Insurance Policyholders in the Disaster Area ▲ Yesterday's Letter to the Compensation Advancement Association Urging Efforts</p>
<p>Fu Keming and other policyholders of Sheng'anfang, Xiangshan Road, Zhabei, sent a joint letter to the Compensation Advancement Association yesterday, saying:</p>
<p>Respectfully, since the January 28th Songhu Incident, Keming's and others' residences were the first to bear the brunt. Although lives were spared from the artillery fire, properties were completely lost. Are these not bombed during the war? And destroyed after our army retreated? We have written to the insurance company to compensate for the fire insurance, but they are using the excuse of war to evade responsibility. However, the date of the fire is provable from newspapers, and the facts are traceable. Policyholders have the obligation to pay fees, and the company has the responsibility to pay compensation. How can they shirk their responsibility and disregard commercial credit? We rely on your public-spiritedness to be responsible for the negotiation. According to reports, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to convene relevant parties on the 10th of this month to discuss measures. Your association will also send representatives to attend the meeting. Therefore, we specially send this letter, requesting you to strive for justice to achieve the goal of compensation, so as to benefit the recovery of the disaster area. We hope to receive your guidance. We are sincerely grateful.</p>
<p>Haining Compatriots Telegraph Zhejiang Officials to Request Suspension of Tax Collection</p>
<p>Haining compatriots in Shanghai telegraphed the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Director of the Finance Department, and the Magistrate of Haining County yesterday, saying:</p>
<p>Chairman Lu of the Hangzhou Provincial Government, Director Zhou of the Finance Department, and Magistrate Wang Jun of Haining County, we acknowledge receipt. Haining County has had consecutive poor harvests in recent years. This spring, the silkworm crop failed and the cocoon prices were low. The people's savings are already exhausted, and their livelihoods have been cut off. Starvation and suicide are unfortunately common. Desperate risks have led to a collective grain-snatching trend. If it continues to spread, it will be difficult to control. The county government is still collecting taxes at this time, which further provokes the anger of the people. Therefore, we urgently telegraph your seat, requesting you to quickly allocate large sums of money to provide urgent relief to save the dying people. At the same time, immediately telegraph the county government to suspend tax collection and withdraw the special tax collection officers, so as to prolong their lives and eliminate hidden dangers. We are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>From the Ningbo Haichang Public Association and the Haining Relief Donation Association, Xu Guangpu and others bow.</p>

<p>National Postal Workers' Congress Postponed ▲ Representatives Pushed to Explain to the Central Government</p>
<p>The National Postal Workers' Union originally scheduled its annual congress for the 15th of this month in Shanghai, and had notified representatives from various regions to attend. However, it subsequently received a telegram from the central government, ordering the Ministry of Communications to stop it. The postal workers believe that the central government may not have understood the inside story, so they have specially sent representatives to Beijing to explain to the central government to avoid misunderstandings. The congress will be postponed to next month.</p>
<p>Chu Minyi Feasts Lin Baek</p>
<p>Government Legal Advisor Lin Baek arrived in Shanghai from Europe. Member of the Central Committee, Mr. Chu Minyi, held a banquet at his private residence the day before yesterday to welcome Mr. Lin. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to Mr. Chu, Mr. Lin Baek once served as the Legal Advisor to the Premier and has traveled extensively to various countries, engaging in international propaganda for our party, which has been quite diligent. I and Mr. Lin are also old acquaintances. This time he came to China, so I invited friends in Shanghai to welcome him. The banquet was entirely social in nature and did not discuss any official business. However, when Mr. Lin came to China two years ago, he advocated a plan for a raw silver loan and suggested it to our government. Because there was no concrete plan, it was not implemented. Now, after more than a year, Mr. Lin has come to China again. It is still difficult to predict whether the plan he is discussing will be adopted by the central government.</p>
<p>Minhang Two Associations Send Telegram to Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Minhang Soy Sauce, Wine, Tobacco and Paper Industry Associations telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, saying:</p>
<p>Urgent, to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, we acknowledge receipt. Both the Ministry of Finance and the provincial government have issued announcements regarding the tobacco and alcohol license tax in Jiangsu Province. Merchants and citizens believe that paying taxes is an obligation that must be fulfilled. Whether it is managed by the Ministry or the province, it should be paid. It is only because the government orders are inconsistent and there is nothing to follow. If this license tax is still managed by the Ministry, the provincial government should be consulted to immediately abolish the established tax collection bureaus. If the provincial government is allowed to manage it on its own, the affiliated collection agencies should be ordered to close as soon as possible. Only then will merchants and citizens have something to follow.</p>
<p>Shanghai County Minhang Soy Sauce and Wine Industry Association, Tobacco and Paper Industry Association bow.</p>
<p>(The telegram to the provincial government is roughly the same, so it is omitted.)</p>
<p>Hawkers Traveling to France Detained ▲ Passports Believed to be Forged ▲ Wrongfully Detained, Released with Proof</p>
<p>The French Consulate General in Shanghai previously received a telegram from Saigon, intercepting sixteen hawker passports traveling from Shanghai to France, all of which were forged. The sixteen hawkers were detained. One of them, in extreme anger, assaulted someone and was seriously injured. He is being treated in Saigon and will be deported after he recovers. The remaining fifteen detainees were sent to Shanghai by the Messageries Maritimes (霞道斯) mail ship and transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for interrogation. After questioning by the Third Section of the Bureau, each of the hawkers stated that these passports were purchased from the Gonghechang Exchange Shop in Nanshi for more than 300 yuan, including the ship ticket. Detectives were immediately dispatched to Gonghechang for arrest, but the shop owners had already fled in fear of punishment. Only three suspects were taken into custody, and Gonghechang was sealed. It is now heard that these passports are not forged and were indeed issued by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau. After the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to provide proof, the three suspects were released.</p>
<p>Russian Beggar's Corpse to be Examined Today</p>
<p>The suspicious death of Russian beggar Georgy Latygin, who died in the Second Special District Court Detention Center, has caused a stir in society and attracted attention from Chinese and foreigners. The court has notified the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home to transport the coffin to Shanghai for examination to clarify the truth. The director of the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home, Mr. Qin Shounong, for the sake of prudence, specially sent two staff members and four laborers to the Nanshi Life Saving Bureau yesterday morning to borrow a rescue boat to transport the coffin. Due to the small tide period and the long distance, fearing that they would not be able to arrive in time and miss the formalities, they hired a small tugboat to tow it to the Tangwan Cemetery. They exhumed the coffin, verified the number, affixed a strip of paper, and loaded it onto the original boat for transportation to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive at the port at 8 AM this morning. An official letter will be sent to the Second Special District Court to be forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Council morgue for examination.</p>
<p>Public Security Seventh District Uncovers Theft and Sale of Fort Machinery</p>
<p>Around 1 PM the day before yesterday, the Public Security Seventh District of Wusong received a tip-off that someone was stealing and selling important machinery from the Lion Grove Fort and planning to secretly transport it out of Songkou by boat. After receiving the report, the Seventh District, despite the heavy rain, immediately dispatched District Officer Yin Gongtian, along with detectives Wang Yao, Fan Yunhai, Zhao Huairen, and Li Jinqing, and several police officers, to secretly guard the entrance of the Yunzaobang Sitang. Anticipating that the boat would pass through here to leave the port, they waited until dawn yesterday when they saw a boat slowly approaching. District Officer Yin immediately ordered the detectives to approach and order the boat to shore for inspection. They found it fully loaded with artillery machinery, gun carriages, shell casings, and other valuable items. The boatmen and five others were arrested on the spot. They claimed that the machinery and other items were purchased from Wang Adong near the Lion Grove Fort. Wang Yao and others were dispatched to Wang Adong's house for a search, but Wang had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Wang's uncle, Wang Xingqing, was taken into custody. Artillery parts, gun carriage copper parts, and other goods such as barracks lumber were found in Wang's house. A coastal searchlight engine from the fortress was also seized from Fei Songhe's house behind Wang's house (Fei was also on the run). Because the engine was heavy, it was assigned to the police station for safekeeping. Two more suspects were subsequently apprehended near the Lion Grove Fort and taken into custody. Under the strict interrogation of District Chief Li, the suspects confessed that one was Xu Xiaochang, 30 years old, from Yancheng, residing in a thatched shed in Zhangjiabang, Yangshupu, Shanghai; one was Ma Chaoji, 55 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing on Gongping Road, Shanghai; one was Zhou Heyuan, 36 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing on Gongping Road, Shanghai; one was Yao Xinchang, 25 years old, from Gaoyou (boatman); and one was Wu Wanyuan, 50 years old, from Xinghua (boatman). The suspects Guo Shiying and Jin Weiqing were scrap dealers. Wang Xingqing was a local resident, 67 years old. Xu Xiaochang confessed that on the 8th of this month, he and Zhou Heyuan, Ma Chaoji, Chen Xinfu, and others purchased and received [items] from Wang Adong in Lion Grove Fort and sought leniency. The district chief verified the confessions. Considering the severity of the crime of colluding to steal fortress artillery parts, he submitted a report to the General Bureau. The suspects Guo Shiying and Jin Weiqing were released, and Wang Xingqing was released on bail. At the same time, he strictly ordered the subordinates and the Seventh Security Company to apprehend the fugitives Wang Adong and Fei Songhe and bring them to justice for interrogation.</p>
<p>Bomb Found in Paper Package ▲ Same Thing Happened at Two Coal Shops</p>
<p>At around 5 AM yesterday, a coolie-like person came to Xieshenxing Coal Shop at 502 Baokang Lane, Zhejiang Road, holding a paper package and saying that it had to be delivered to the manager. The shopkeeper asked who sent it, but the coolie left without answering. When the paper package was opened, it was a small bomb. The shop immediately reported it to the police station for investigation. It is also heard that the same thing happened at Yuxing Coal Shop at 448 Beijing Road.</p>
<p>French Concession Enthusiastically Prepares to Celebrate French National Day ▲ Municipal Council Organizes Celebration Committee</p>
<p>July 14th is the anniversary of the establishment of the French Republic. French officials, gentry, businessmen, scholars, and people from all walks of life in Shanghai will hold grand celebrations as usual. Last year, due to the workers' strike, the lantern parade was temporarily suspended, and only a lantern display competition was held in Guxiangzhai Park. This year, coinciding with the inauguration of the new French President, the celebration ceremony will be even grander than before. The French Consul General, Mr. Merie, has informed the Municipal Council to organize a celebration committee to prepare for the celebration ceremony. As the date approaches, the engineering department of the Municipal Council is hiring craftsmen to build pine and cypress electric light arches in front of the French Consulate, the Municipal Council, the gate of Guxiangzhai Park (on the Huanlong Road side), and the doors of each police station. Wooden poles are also erected on the Bund, on Gongguan Road, on the Eight Immortals Bridge, and on the Min Tini Yin Road to prepare for hanging flags and lights. The Municipal Council's large clock tower and Guxiangzhai Garden are filled with colorful electric lights and various paper lanterns. All Chinese and Western staff members of the French Concession police station, as well as patrol officers, have contributed money to hire skilled craftsmen to rush to tie up various mobile platforms and differently shaped lanterns. The Western and Chinese members of the fire brigade are also rushing to tie up pine and cypress lanterns on the fire trucks in preparation for participating in the lantern parade competition.</p>
<p>Chen Longsheng Sentenced to Life Imprisonment ▲ Convicted of Killing Ye Wu</p>
<p>Chen Longsheng from Nanjing, residing at No. 88, Xinkang Lane, Taopeng Road, argued with landlord Ye Wu of Yong because of rent arrears on the 19th of last month around 8 PM. He was ridiculed by Wu on the spot, angered by shame, took out a knife from his sleeve, and stabbed her head nine times in a row. Seeing the disaster, he fled. Wu was sent to the hospital for treatment but died. Chen Longsheng was subsequently arrested by Chinese detective Gui Shou of the Yulin Road Police Station at the Xiaoshijie amusement park in the city, along with the murder weapon, and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The case was concluded after the debate, pending sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Fu Lin presided over the Fourth Criminal Court and sentenced Chen Longsheng to life imprisonment and confiscated the murder weapon.</p>

<p>Ms. Pan Zhang, a 27-year-old young woman residing at No. 28, East Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, committed suicide by swallowing raw opium yesterday at around 2 PM after her husband complained a few times because their child mistakenly ate cold noodles and cold tea. She refused to be outdone and retorted. Afterwards, she was extremely remorseful. After being discovered, she was immediately taken to Renji Hospital but died around 6 PM in the evening. The body was transferred from the hospital to the morgue for examination.</p>

<p>[H&lt;Fourth Sheet&gt;H] [Local News Two] Heavy Rain, One Person Killed by Lightning ▲ Three Rooms Collapse on Qingyun Road</p>
<p>Yesterday's weather was hot, with temperatures reaching 96.6 degrees. At 5:30 PM, dark clouds gathered, and there was a heavy downpour. In the Zhabei area, a sudden thunderbolt struck and killed a worker on Yongxing Branch Road. The deceased, Zhu Shouming, 21 years old, from Jingjiang, worked at the Ni Senmao Construction Company on Yongxing Branch Road. He died instantly after being struck by lightning, his skin turning blue-purple, a frightening sight. The Fourth District Public Security Bureau dispatched police to investigate. In addition, three houses collapsed on Qingyun Road, Zhabei, during the heavy thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoting Missing ▲ Traveling with American Powell ▲ American Warships Searching Together</p>
<p>American film director Powell, along with Mr. Wang Xiaoting, filmed the Yangtze River Three Gorges for Fox Corporation. After the work was completed, they returned to Yichang by Minsheng steamer from Wanxian but have been missing for several days. The company's Far East photography director, Alexander, fearing that they had encountered bandits en route, visited the flagship captain in Shanghai yesterday and requested assistance in the search. The captain immediately ordered all American warships upstream of the Yangtze River to search together.</p>
<p>Flower Society Barges Active</p>
<p>Since Bei Fantao, Luo Ji and Chai Pian Fan and others set up flower society big cylinder/big operation after the Flower Association was created, public opinion has been unanimously and actively opposed. The Municipal Government Public Security Bureau has now ordered all districts to investigate and arrest them. The Public Security Bureau has found that in addition to the above two people as the backbone, there is also a flower society barge head nicknamed "Yellow Bean Soup" at the Tai Wharf in Nanshi, and Xiaotiedun outside the West Gate is also the head of the listening cylinder. The headquarters of Kuaiba/Fast Horse is located near the Nanshi Guild Hall, with more than a dozen of the latest flying bicycles, speeding in the road every evening. Only because the gangsters of each backbone usually are known by their mixed names, it is impossible to arrest them for a while. However, because of this strict investigation, they have no doubt converged. Now the big cylinder/operation has moved to the countryside, but the distance is too far from the gamblers, which has an impact on their business. Therefore, barges are working hard for this.</p>
<p>Hu Jia Mu Bridge Fire Brigade Executive and Supervisory Committee Records ▲ Captain Fang Zhenyao Reinstated</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 10th), the Hu Jia Mu Bridge Fire Brigade, in order to resume work after the war, promote the progress of the association, and welcome the reinstatement of Captain Fang Zhenyao, specially convened a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee to discuss all matters related to the progress. More than 100 people including Zhang Peisi and Tang Jingshou attended. Chairman Zhang announced the purpose of the meeting, stating that since Director Fang took office, it has been three years. He has been extremely enthusiastic about fire protection work, such as purchasing fire engines and adding equipment, without sparing any effort. Unfortunately, the January 28th Shanghai Incident suddenly occurred, and the association's headquarters bore the brunt. Fortunately, Mr. Fang tried every means to venture to drive the pumper truck and fire engine to a safe area for storage, so this restoration work was able to recover its original state in the shortest possible time, all thanks to Mr. Fang. However, as soon as the situation stabilized, the director suddenly resigned. Although many efforts were made to retain him, Mr. Fang was determined to resign. Seeing that fire protection is one of the important local policies, each gentry and merchant believed that the team must have someone in charge. Moreover, after the incident, everything must be reorganized. Only those with the ability of Mr. Fang can properly manage it. Now, representatives have been elected by various groups to make earnest efforts to retain Mr. Fang. Mr. Fang has agreed to take office on a scheduled date. The association will hold a meeting to welcome him at the scheduled time. Everyone agreed. The date will be announced after agreeing with Mr. Fang. Next, the gentlemen present conducted thorough discussions on the progress of the association's affairs. The meeting ended at 3 PM.</p>
<p>East Xihua De Road/Euston Road Armed Robbery Case Trial</p>
<p>The robbers, Zhang Xingfu, Jin Heshang, and Gao Heshang from Ningbo, armed and organized a gang to rob Mrs. Luo Wang from Guangdong at No. 1133, East Xihua De Road for clothing worth 738 yuan around noon on the 24th of last month. They fled to the house at No. 159, Aerok Road, where Chinese Detective Cai Zhitian and Detective Qi Mengqing of the Huishan Police Station learned of the situation. They secretly went together with Western detectives to arrest the three robbers, along with the woman Jin Cai, and took them all into the police station. They learned that some of the clothes were mortgaged at the Demao Pawnshop at No. 236 Huade Road, so the detectives went and suspended the clothes. They were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court the day before yesterday. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin said that the defendants had admitted their guilt in the police station. Because the accomplices had not yet been caught, he requested an extension. He presented the stolen goods for inspection. Then the victim Luo Wang said that there were five robbers at the time. They entered from the back door. One robber asked if there was a Gu family in her house. She replied no. The defendant Gao Heshang said, "Please help," and took out a pistol to warn them not to make a sound. Then they went upstairs and rummaged through the boxes and cabinets, and began to search and rob. They fled from the back door with a hoot. She pointed out that the defendant Jin Heshang had a towel wrapped around his face at the time and could not see clearly. The clothes presented in the case were indeed the original stolen goods. According to Zhang Xing's confession, he did not enter the house. Xiaoshaoxing said that the victim's house had a large amount of opium and asked him to go and rob it. The rest of the confession was evasive. Jin Heshang confessed that there were five people who went at that time. He did not know about the meals and the sporadic expenses. Zhang Xingfu and Gao Heshang did go together, but he did not wrap a towel around his face and did not enter the house, only standing guard at the back door. Gao Heshang confessed that he only knew Jin Heshang for three days. Xiaoshaoxing was the one who initiated the matter. He denied threatening Luo Wang with a gun. Jin Cai confessed that she was the wife of * Heshang. Zhang Xingfu asked her to pawn the clothes and took * with him. She did not enter the house. Judge Shen ordered them to be taken back to prison separately for further investigation.</p>

<p>Engineer Drowned in Mingyuan Swimming Pool</p>
<p>At 12:15 PM yesterday, Jin Shunming, a 35-year-old Cantonese engineer from the Huade Road Mingyuan Dog Racing Track, went to the park's swimming pool alone to inspect the water level.

<p>Mogan Mountain Guide Published</p>
<p>Mogan Mountain is a resort for escaping the summer heat. The mountains are covered with bamboo, which is cool and pleasant. The highest temperature has never exceeded 86 degrees. In recent years, Chinese and Westerners have flocked to the mountain for summer vacation. The China Travel Service has always been dedicated to serving the society. In addition to establishing a summer office in the mountain with the Shanghai Bank, it recently compiled and printed a Mogan Mountain Guide, because tourists climbing the mountain suffer from the lack of a practical book. The content is rich and very interesting. It is divided into more than ten categories, including overview, area, scenic spots, hotels, transportation, public utilities, agencies, itinerary, arts and culture, and appendices. There are dozens of illustrations. The entire book has more than 100 pages, printed on high quality paper. The cover is signed by Mr. Huang Yingbai and printed with a light green bamboo forest landscape, which is very exquisite. The company mainly promotes travel, not for profit from selling books. Each copy is only sold for half the cost, 20 cents. It is on sale from today. Those who want to visit Mogan Mountain in this hot summer should have a copy.</p>

<p>Crackdown on Old and Young Pulling Rickshaws</p>
<p>The Bureau has long strictly prohibited the elderly and children from pulling rickshaws in the city. However, the rules have been ignored for a long time. Recently, there have been reports of elderly people and young children pulling rickshaws and running around the city. Now that it is summer, these people are prone to danger under the scorching sun due to their weakness. Director Wen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in view of this situation, believes that it is inhumane and has immediately notified all districts and offices under his jurisdiction to strictly prohibit it.</p>
