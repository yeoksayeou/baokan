<h3 id="c1">政治紛亂與學潮 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>彬</p>
<p>邇年以來。以政治之不上軌道。我國内一切都呈現混亂與破落之現想而尤以敎育之破産。更令吾人深感國本動摇。國家前途。危機暗伏且其禍不僅在於目前。直及於數十百年之後。</p>
<p>自去年東北禍變突發激起全國。如火如茶之學潮以來。一般靑年早已深感國亡無日。而不能安心於其所學。頃近以敎育經費之無着。與思想之爭門全國各地之學潮。復又有重新展開之形勢。如最近安徽各中學校長以敎費無着。出總辭職。南京國立中央大學。全體敎授以欠薪無着。亦全體請假實即無形罷敎。又如浙江大學之學生。反對工學院長。敎授以生活無着罷敎湖南長沙學聯會。以檢查日貨與商界發生衝突。而被查封。徐州中學以要求往外埠參觀未遂而罷課。更如北平大學。因反對工學院長而反對校長沈尹默北平師範大學。以擇長而組織全體學生護校南下示威團。北平風潮且有波及中小學。日益擴大之形勢。就此種情勢而觀。可見學潮又有日益爆發之兆徵。檢查誘致學潮之主因大抵不外於擇師經費無着愛國運動等項然而時人言及學潮。輒都表示痛心疾首。視學生爲乖戾囂。張無可救藥。固矣。靑年血氣方剛。認識未深。亦容或有逾軌之過失。然而吾人與其以此責諸學生母寗以此責諸敎育之責任者。更母寗以此責諸政治之紛亂。蓋學潮之作絶不由於單方面少數學生之過失也。</p>
<p>强敵壓境。山河破碎。九一八與一二八兩次變亂。凡有血氣。無不悲憤然而上海停戰之協定。甫經簽字。國内蝸角之爭持又作。國日危殆。處於此種環境之下。而謂感覺敏銳之靑年學生。能安心向學乎。邇歲以來。國民經濟已日。呈破落。去歲大水。舉國陸沉。農村經濟更受重創。國民生計更陷於極端艱苦之悲境。至今災區無以救濟。災民輾轉流離。正不啻處於人間地獄。然而在另方面。則政治領袖之爭權奪利如故也都市人民之驕奢逸藥亦如故也處於此種情勢之下。又謂靑年學生。能安心向學乎。即以敎育之本身而言政府當局之對於敎育無久遠計劃。而不知造成活的敎育創造的敎育。固無論矣即最低限度之敎育經費。亦時常欠發。一任敎授坐索。學生呼籲。而政府當局仍視之漠然。國家年可費國幣百分之八十以上以養二百餘萬之軍隊政治當局可任意將巨欵贈貽個人并可以鉅欵治主席之官邸。獨業此必不容少之敎育經費。則長年欠發。使學校日虞停閉。主持者無以進行其計劃敎授以迨於生計。不得不以罷課相要脅。處於此種情勢之下。更謂靑年學生能安心讀書乎。</p>
<p>故我國令日事實上已無敎育。政治一日而不上執道。則敎育一日無法整頓。而學潮亦一日無由正息。事所必然。理所當然。若徒歸咎於學生之囂張好亂。是母乃爲捨其本而欲齊其末歟。</p>

<p>世界新聞社云、東京時事新報近有文論洛桑會議之難關、在德法兩國之態度、春言略云、美國雖不參加此次會議、但彼仍居於戰債的支配者之地位、對此會議當然注意、然彼國輿論、由於深刻不况之體騐、乃唱出美政府戰債减額或竟取消之論調、而一般對德持有多額債權之金融資本家對此亦均贊成、因美政府如將戰債减額或竟取消、則彼等對德債權之收回、比較容易也、至於英國、亦同情於德之立塲、參與戰債賠償條約之締結之勞合喬治氏、於其近著「賠償問題之眞相」一書中、高唱（一）凡適用胡佛停付計畫之戰債及賠償、應永久廢棄之、（二）德國年支付賠償公債（根據道斯楊格兩案）以外之賠償之必要、至於德法兩國之態度實爲此次會議之難關、蓋法之對德、依然保持其反對態度、主張嚴格履行凡爾塞條約、至於德國在白魯寗内閣握權期間、</p>
<p>對賠償問題、尚有一脈誠意、今白氏失勢、賠償前途亦因之趨於黯淡、希特勒之國社會黨自昔即以廢棄凡爾塞條約爲揭藥、如希氏執政、則賠償履行百無一望、今則執政者爲巴本氏、然巴本氏與希特勒一派本有相當聯絡、誠如勞合喬治之言曰、一白魯寗之民治政府則不能支付賠償、希特勒派國家黨與共産黨政府則不願支付、」總之、德國政權任何人掌握、賠償履行終必困難也、</p>

<p>議有種種辦法</p>
<p>華租當局合作</p>
<p>大陸報云、昨日（十三）上海市衛生局工務局及兩租界工程處與濬浦局等代表、在工部局會商取締垃圾傾棄浦江問題、集議半日、已决定種種辦法、其立可見諸實行者、如（一）夜問監督難周、嗣後禁止垃圾船夜間運載、（二）浦江中多派監督人員、防止垃圾船隻沿途傾棄、（三）在龍華嘴囤積垃圾地方挖掘引河、俾垃圾船隻可駛入卸落、（四）在囤積垃圾地方派警監督、（五）垃圾船上面必須遮蓋、旣免臭氣外溢、又可防沿途傾棄、（六）垃圾裝船時、先行過磅、由管理人員填票交給船户、俟運抵囤積地方、再由管理人員收票過磅、俾船户沿途不敢傾棄、（七）船户違章、嚴加懲罰、現濬浦局總工程師法賽德已估計在龍華嘴附近開掘引河工費、據法氏言、全河工費並不甚鉅、上海市力所勝任、其計劃擬在垃圾囤積地中間、挖掘引河、長三百</p>
<p>呎、廣八十呎、深六呎、兩旁築岸、俾將來有蓋垃圾船可停靠兩岸卸落、據聞昨日會議時、租界當局曾提出現在囤積垃圾地之久暫問題、深恐一旦妥善計劃實施後、中國當道忽認龍華嘴不宜再囤積垃圾、致徒勞而靡費、但又據衛生局某君言、上海市政府極願與兩租界當道合作、</p>

<p>如暴日之侵略我東北。攻撃我淞滬。其爲害雖鉅。然顯而易見。足以使我全國人民痛心疾首。永矢不忘。經濟侵略則不然。以商戰代兵戰。帝國主義列强。挾工業先進國之利器。以機器生産。壓迫我手工生産。其勢力深深侵入我内地。雖窮鄉僻壞。無不有洋貨。即無不有帝國主義列强之勢力。在無形中吸收我金錢。以制我死命。年深日久。使我國經濟日趨於破産。而我國人雖身受其痛苦。尙有不知其原因之何在者。政治侵略。如急性傳染病。尙可以用防疫方法。爲顯著之抵抗。經濟侵</p>
<p>略如慢性肺癆。使人於不知不覺中漸漸瘦損。以致於死命。故我國今日經濟上的危機。其來也非一朝一夕。利權外溢。已數十年。惟至今日而病狀漸顯、經濟痛苦日深一日。瞻望前途。誠有令人不寒而慄者。茲爲喚醒國人起見。根據海關報告及現在經濟恐慌之事實。以爲事實上之證明。</p>
<p>民國元年以來。海關進口洋貨之數量。年年超過土貨出口之數量。自元年至二十年。最少爲民國八年。進口超過出口爲一千六百餘萬兩。最多爲二十年。進口超過出口爲五萬五千九百餘萬兩。總計二十年中。進口超過出口爲三十九萬一千二百餘萬海關兩。合上海規銀四十三萬五千八百餘萬兩。照現在市價。合國幣六十萬萬元以上。試問以二十年之短期間。因國人喜用洋貨。使金錢外溢達六十萬萬元以上。我國安得而不窮。全國經濟狀况、安得而不發生恐慌。不但如是。假使我國人能明瞭窮困之原因。在於金錢外溢太多。而急起努力生産。推廣國貨。則病尙有救。無如經濟恐慌。儘經濟恐慌。喜用洋貨者。仍喜用洋貨。本年春季三個月。據海關報告。進口洋貨爲二萬六千一百</p>
<p>餘萬兩。出口土貨爲一萬四千一百餘萬兩。進口超過出口又有一萬二千一百餘萬兩。不但如是。即以上海一埠而論。進口超過出口。一月份爲五千二百餘萬兩。二月份一千四百餘萬兩。三月份二千六百餘萬兩、上海一埠。三個月總計。進口超過出口已有九千三百餘萬兩之多、四月份據西報所載。上海一埠進口爲五千四百餘萬兩。出口爲九百餘萬兩。進口超過出口爲四千四百餘萬兩。故以上海一埠而論。本年四個月進口超過出口、已有一萬三千八百餘萬兩之多、合國幣在二萬萬元以上。若以全國論。至少在一萬六千六百萬兩以上。合國幣在二萬六千萬元以上、天以國難當頭之今年。僅四個月之短期間。進口超過出口。又有二萬六千萬元之多。前途茫茫。眞不知何以爲繼。以上僅就數字而論。中國經濟上之危險。已顯然可見。茲更就海關報告一察進口貨物之種類。</p>
<p>民國二十年。進口貨總值爲十三萬零九百餘萬兩。其中棉貨爲一萬四千九百餘萬兩。棉花爲一萬三千二百餘萬兩。米爲一萬二千一百餘萬兩。糖爲八千六百餘萬兩。烟葉及紙烟爲五千六百餘萬兩。麫粉爲三千一百餘萬兩。海味爲二千五百餘萬兩。毛織品爲二千四百餘萬兩。菓品藥材等爲二千三百餘萬兩。木材爲二千三百餘萬兩。人造絲爲一千四百餘萬兩。小麥爲一千二百餘萬兩。罐頭食物爲一千二百餘萬兩。此皆爲人民生活所必需。而皆有賴於洋貨。不但金錢外溢爲可懼。萬一世界發生戰事。交通阻滯。洋貨不能進口或减少進口。則我國人之衣食。豈不發生缺少供給或斷供給之危險。至於生産工具之機器。同年進口數量。僅值四千四百餘萬兩。在十三萬零九百餘萬兩進口總額之中。僅佔百分之三點三八。可知進口洋貨百分之九十以上爲消耗品。一年復一年。消耗復消耗。勢必窮困日甚。此我國人所不能不覺悟者也。</p>
<p>中國經濟上之病象。最返已漸漸顯露。内地金融。日益枯竭。出口貨日少。進口貨日多。使内地現金。集中於上海。因現金集中上海之故。使上海現金過剩。洋厘縮小。銀拆低廉。用途毫無。而内地各省。因金融枯竭。缺少現金購買上海匯票。以致上海匯票價格飛漲。最近江西方面。因洋貨進口。均由上海而來。不能不購上海匯票。以資應付。同時因爲出口土貨太少。無可取之欵以相抵。以致匯水飛漲。在江西購買上海匯票一千兩。需用國幣一千四百三十八元。比較平時高出五十元之多。結果不但洋貨在内地售價。增高百分之五以上。即他省土貨。經由上海而運至江西者。亦大受匯水高漲之累。此不過舉以爲例。其實經濟恐慌。遍地皆是。不僅江西一省爲然。其總因在於内地各省。兵匪交閧。捐稅繁苛。交通不便。運費高昻以致土貨不能出口。或不易出口。農工無利可獲。生計日窘。生産日减。以致生活所需。仰賴洋貨。而内地金融。遂致陷入窮途。幾至無可挽救。夫中國素稱以農立國。今米麥棉花木材烟葉。均爲農産品之進口大宗。其中尤以棉布進口數量爲最。故在今日我全國人士。必須集中力量。。故在今日我全國人士。必須集中力量。厲行三事。第一剷除生産障碍。努力增加生産。第二管理對外貿易。節制洋貨進口。第三喚起國家思想。努力推廣國貨。凡此三事。均有聯帶關係。果能共同努力。着着實行。則中國經濟上之危機。庶不致日陷日深。而有出危境登康莊之一日。此余所馨香禱祝者也。</p>

<h3 id="c253">少讀書可以減少痛苦 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 梅花</p>
<p>吾的一生最可笑，也最可痛，一面看外國科學一天一天的發達，一面看中國的一切一天一天的敗落。吾一生所看到的全是這些矛看的現象，多麽痛心啊！痛苦，假定吾可讀書，尤其是少讀外國書，還可以减少些痛苦，然而現在呢，滿目都是凄凉，觸目都是驚心！中國一天的敗落，從拳匪到黨國，每痀愈下；外國一天一天的進步，不但在科學方面如此，即在政治方面也是如此。譬如以前各國都是君主，現在幾乎都變爲民主國，即使保持君主政體的國家，也都已變成了虚君共和的政體。英國的君主向來是假皇帝，比利時這小國家，從一八三○年以來，也有一個世襲的假皇帝。說也可笑，歐洲的皇帝多數是向别國請來的，譬如比利時的君主是向德意志請求，以前法國的波旁王室也不是法國自已人，總之歐洲人皇帝思想和中國人完全兩樣。所以，歐洲人纔有殖民的思想。</p>
<p>我們中國人不然，向來祗有「天無二主，地無二王」的親念，因此閉關自守，絶對没有殖民的思想。其實講到政治的主權，什麽家天下，公天下，都不是澈底的說法，打穿沙鍋問到底，主權旣不屬於一人，也不屬於人人，而是屬於造物主。在造物主的面前，一切人類都是平等，所以，主權屬於造物主，也就屬於人人。（翰按相老對於宗敎有堅决的信仰，他主張民主，但他的民主論是以宗敎做出發點，可以說是神權的民主論，姑誌之以供研究政論者之參考）</p>
<p>主權屬於造物，也屬於人人。可是主體是誰都可以充數的。譬如，牌位有靈，可是牌位用什麽木頭都可以做成的。日本人崇拜天皇，其實天皇無權，這就是牌位主義。中國人拜死人做皇帝，這是黨國的創舉，遠不及牌位主義的好。</p>

<p>敵軍所向如偃草，長春以南無完堡，降敵苦多殺敵少，危城獨以孤軍當，二百廿人無一降，城存與存亡與亡，萬騎壓城城欲動，城上健兒氣山湧，浴血應戰無旋踵，一夫奮臂百夫從，上馬砍陣如飛龍，同拚一死爲鬼雄，見賊便剃刀鋒利，左盤右辟恣我意，敵兵來者俱伏地，千聲萬聲呼殺倭，倭殺不盡來益多，我力盡矣將奈何，苦戰終日命同畢，血刃在胡眥猶裂，是豈我心乃我節。</p>

<p>— 清</p>
<p>防銹油　鐵製的日用器具，新時色澤光，潤，便於日用，經時稍久，每易生銹，旣失美觀，又不適用，如菜刀等物，尤須注重衛生，以防疾病的傳染，防銹油，旣可防止生銹，又可防止腐爛，實爲日用不可少的一種物品，原料，用樹枝十五分，雲母末五百分，豚脂二百五十分，黄蠟四十五分，橄欖油及松油各四十五分，法將樹脂，豚脂，橄欖油，黄蠟，同置一鐵鍋内，用微火熔化，拌匀，加入雲母末，離火，再將松節油詷下，攬和即成。臭藥水　臭藥水的利用，異常普徧，城市鄉村，都可用他避疫去臭，本埠住民，更當多備，因爲戰爭之後，易發疫病，在夏日蒸熨之時，更覺一種需要的物品，其法用等量之木炭生石灰，及粗製碌礬，法將三物分别細研裝入玻璃瓶内，想用的時候取粉末少許，和入清水内灑於四隅。可以避瘟去臭，且較市上出售，價錢便宜得多了。</p>
<p>鍍銀玻璃　鍍銀玻璃，用途也非常廣闊，市舖店中嘗有出售，其法用亞水硝酸銀葡萄糖三樣物品，做成一個二比四一的比例，及適當的酒精和清水，將亞母尼亞水與硝酸銀好酒精水各六份，（即六倍於所用葡萄糖之量）共溶成液體，再行過濾使清，另將葡萄糖和酒精水各一份，也溶爲液體，與以前的液體混合，於是用玻璃器洗淨，侵於混合成功的液體内，過了二三天，就變爲鍍銀的玻璃了，</p>

<p>— 昂漣</p>
<p>一天熱閙的婚禮過去了。</p>
<p>這時候約莫是夜裏十二點鐘的光景，母親姨母們把Ｇ送進新房裏，一天來提心弔胆的惶恐終於消失，以爲從此便「百年好合」了。</p>
<p>「Ｇ，明天晏些起來也罷，看你今天好像很疲倦似的」，Ｇ的母親臨踏出門口時這樣温柔地說。</p>
<p>Ｇ只「晤」的一聲回答，他腦袋沉重得隠隠作痛，昏昏的好像一個無歸宿的游魂，一眼看見新婦正坐在床沿弄衣裾，猛的一個念頭湧上他的心來，使他不覺打了寒噤。</p>
<p>「完了！」他脫口呌出來。</p>
<p>新婦有點惶惑，抬頭看見他的臉好像罩上了一重嚴霜，眼睛張得多麽可怕，似乎中了魔一般的直釘着她，她心裏有些慌張，眞猜不透他爲什麽表示一種悲憤的樣子，花燭之夜，本該如何的懷着好奇和甜蜜的情趣才對啊。</p>
<p>窗外瀟瀟地下起細雨來，她心裏更覺不快，忽聽得一陣嗚咽聲從伏在桌上的新郎發出，這悽切的啜泣，在這死寂的深夜裏，隠隠地如一隻受創的野獸的痛楚，她從來没有聽見男子如此可怕的哭過，不覺微微顫慄了。</p>
<p>「這是一個很不好的預兆啊！」她想。</p>
<p>二點鐘敲過了，哭聲已經銷滅，她還在床沿等待他，等得眞耐煩了，而且十分疲倦，對他開始懷着一腔恨意，聽他哭聲停止後，便像石像一般坐着不動，又不敢去驚動他，她怕羞，她又奇怪，一個鄉下女子，怎麽可以輕易先開口問他，可是他是男子呀，難道這樣不近情啊？不覺一個可怕的影像，籠罩住了她的心，她髣髴是一個被擯棄的女人</p>
<p>「也許嫌我不漂亮吧，所以，他···」她自己憂愁着，反覆地想着，她覺得睡魔攻撃得使好再不能忍耐等下去了。</p>
<p>三點四點······敲過了，夜在漫漫地前進着。</p>
<p>一覺醒來，他拭一拭忪惺的眼睛，摸摸她身邊，有没有人？没有？太陽已經從窗口射進來，椅子上空着，Ｇ不知道什麽時候出去了。</p>
<p>正在梳洗的當兒，婆婆拿了一封信，涙痕滿面的說，「走了！Ｇ昨夜偷走了！」婆婆唏唏的哭着。</p>
<p>「······」新婦說不出話來，她證實了不好的預兆已經到來，似乎她的命運早就注定了的，她是一個被擯棄的女人，　　可是誰擯棄了她呢？是Ｇ，還是她的父母呢？她腦海混亂了。</p>
<p>Ｇ的父親慌忙走進來，把Ｇ的信拆開來讀。</p>
<p>「永别了！我的父母！我寗願犧牲學業，寗願不要家庭供給我的生活，寗願到黑暗的社會中受苦，但不願屈服在無人道封建的禮敎，和現社會的萬惡金錢底鐵蹄下，去和那毫不相識而且無愛情的女人結婚，永别了，恕我沾汚了你家的「好門風」吧。　兒Ｇ留書！</p>
<p>「禮敎·····」新婦髣髴聽見這兩個新鮮的字眼兒，她眼前一陣昏黑，倒了下去······。</p>

<p>— 一薛</p>
<p>他因爲妻子生病，向行裏多請了幾天假，高鼻子的大班，就擺出資本家的面孔，把他辭退了，</p>
<p>一年前得了至好同學介紹考進這高鼻子的洋行就把新婚的妻子從鄉間接出來租了一問亭子間，行裏薪金雖微，省吃儉用，一夫一妻的生活，也可維持過去，半年後，生了兒子，對於這愛的結晶，他們更愛護非凡，他每天節省來往的車費，以購兒子的營養品，</p>
<p>這一點苦中的快樂，還不使他們滿足的接受，他的妻子！或者操作過甚，或者資本家所造的三層樓弄堂房子的亭子問，空氣太汚濁了，患了時疫式的傳染病，在一問小小亭子問裏，他要保護兒子不和病人接近，一面還要服侍他的妻子，上海的醫生，不會敲竹槓的不是名醫，一個洋行裏的小職員，當然應付乏術，經濟起了恐慌，起初還能典押度日，維持了一星期，高鼻子的大班，爲他請假過多，一封信把他辭退了，他在混亂的情緒中，也没有想到今後的生活，最要緊目前是怎樣過去，不得已向近一點的親戚方面告貸，所說「雪中送炭世間少，錦上添花老面皮」看他寒酸的樣子，連普通的敷衍話也没有，冷水冰的送了出來，</p>
<p>他没有目的的向前走，躑躅到黄浦江邊，望着滾滾江水，可嘆不知埋葬多少英雄豪傑，自已滿腹才學，卒至養不活一妻一子，正想其要這樣輕輕的一蹤身，豈多是萬事俱休，但是社會局的一塊「死不得，快回頭」的觸目驚心的木牌，映進他的眼廉，他摇摇頭又想很快的跑回家去，耳畔好像有人對他說，一妻之病，兒子餒，不去死，將奈何！」</p>
<p>靜止的江心突然起了一陣浪花，一圈一圈的水浪慢慢放大，至於無窮盡，</p>

<p>福特新車出世以來。在汽車界中放一異彩。該廠除將新車所具之各種改革優良之處。昭告世人外。並將樣車分發各經售商。在大都廣邑之中。廣爲陳列。引人注意。據美國汽車商業報所載。福特經售商自將新車樣子在樣子間中陳列以來。逐日前往觀光考察新車者。數以萬計。截至最近。竟達一千三百萬人之多。又據福特公司駐華經理克羅氏稱。各地陳列之新福特八缸汽車。自經大衆參觀之後。當時即有三○○、○○○輛爲觀衆定去。亦足見新車之優良。深入人心矣。某獨立汽車刋物。盛稱新車足以代表二十九年來福特造車經騐之進步成功。並道其革新改進之處。全憑其歷來之實騐。及綜合各長處而成云云。</p>
<p>福特八缸及四缸新車應世之前。該廠籌備經營。歷有數月之久。其爲製造新車而僱用之工人逾一○○、○○○名。據「汽車日刋」載稱。福特氏之急於將新車問世。乃受胡佛總統私人之慫恿而致。胡佛深悉汽車銷售之增加。實際上能令合衆國之繁榮易於回復云。據福特氏自稱其所製造之八缸新車。馬力極足。但其管理上之簡單便易。一若其速率及機力所具之兩種特色。至其定價則以買賣兩方各得其平爲原則。福氏又謂。渠於製造之成本在所勿計。苟一計及。則定價必隨之而增。然而在此經濟不景氣中。售價何能再高。職是之故。時間金錢均不在計算之中。其職責祇求設法工人得以早日有工作可做耳。</p>
<p>福特氏除發表上述之意見外。又稱在八缸新車具有六十五匹馬力者外。福特公司尙造一種四缸汽車。具有五十匹馬力。各種缸數之汽車均有十四種不同之車身。此兩種四缸及八缸汽車。除引擎上之結構不同外。此外並無若何之差異。車身及車架均各相同。但其售價則各有不同。因八缸汽車Ｖ八式者將列於低價汽車之中。百四缸者之售價較八缸者尤廉、福特氏稱該公司之所以如是辦法者。乃欲爲使用汽車之公衆服務。並於經濟不穏之秋。以廉價物美之汽車供諸買衆。</p>
<p>新車之特色。一時不能盡述。舉其犖犖大者。爲無聲同時動作齒輪桿。無聲齒輪。引擎用橡皮包襯。炭化减聲器。自動式火花管理。隔板式唧筒將後油櫃之燃料輸入引擎。此外尙有柔性可曲之肱木式彈簧。新氏之後彈簧。自動校正好台爾雙動水式避震器。大形四輪煞車。新式電鍜鋼輻車輪。具有大形之轂及轂帽大輪圈。車架及行勤之齒輪間。以橡皮爲隔離。俾彈簧及鏈環之農動不致牽連及於車身。車身車架之間亦以橡皮勢陷。</p>
<p>車身自Ｖ式散熱器至後尾。式樣異常新鮮美觀。長形之車頭作流化式。並有不銹之鋼直線。風屏有傾斜式之安全玻璃。車頂作圓線形。其他如凸出之車頭燈。車頭護遮桿及低長之踏脚板。均與全身相稱。配合適宜雅觀。車廂内部殊爲寛暢。裝飾亦極華麗。車坐係新式頗爲舒適。駕駛之坐位凡在轎車内者均可校正、車頂上有通氣之裝置。機紐板作橢圓形式。且有不銹之鋼片爲襯。轎車中均有眉庇。可以折疊。</p>
<p>福特引擎之Ｖ式者其度數爲九十度。具有動力卅匹之馬力。煞車力六十五匹。每分鐘三、四○○轉。活塞爲鋁質合金所製。具有圈環三個。低下者作爲管油之用。汽缸座及曲柄箱相鑄於一起。構造甚爲堅牢。新式之弇其尾作簟形。係由曲拐軸而動作。引擎中不用中阻齒輪。火花之管理係自動式。曲拐箱及曲拐針这油潤係用壓力所致。活塞及弇之滑潤則用潑濺法。冷却系中之扇作飛機暗輪式。另有離中心式之水唧筒。及廣汽之散熱方法。故無論車行如何程度。均能保持其冷却之作用。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Political Turmoil and Student Protests <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>By Bin</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the off-track nature of politics, everything in our country has presented a chaotic and declining appearance. In particular, the bankruptcy of education has made us deeply feel that the foundation of the nation is shaking and the future of the country is fraught with hidden crises. Moreover, its harm is not only limited to the present but extends to decades or even centuries later.</p>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the Northeast Incident last year, which ignited nationwide student protests like a raging fire, the general youth have long felt that national demise is imminent and cannot concentrate on their studies. Recently, due to the lack of educational funding and ideological disputes, student protests in various parts of the country have shown signs of re-emerging. For example, the principals of various middle schools in Anhui recently resigned en masse due to the lack of educational funding. The entire faculty of the National Central University in Nanjing also took collective leave, which is actually a de facto strike, due to unpaid salaries. Furthermore, students at Zhejiang University opposed the dean of the engineering school. Professors went on strike due to the difficulty in making a living. The Changsha Student Federation in Hunan clashed with the business community over the inspection of Japanese goods and was shut down. A middle school in Xuzhou went on strike because their request to visit other places was not granted. Even more, Peking University opposed the dean of the engineering school and opposed the president, Shen Yinmo. Peking Normal University organized a student demonstration group to protect the school and went south to protest for the selection of a new president. The turmoil in Peking is also spreading to primary and secondary schools, with an increasingly expanding situation. From this situation, it can be seen that there are signs of an increasingly erupting student protest. The main reasons for inducing student protests are generally nothing more than the selection of teachers, lack of funding, and patriotic movements. However, when people talk about student protests, they often express deep grief and regard students as perverse, noisy, and incorrigible. It is true that young people are full of vigor and have shallow understanding, and they may have excesses. However, instead of blaming the students, we should blame those responsible for education, and even more so, we should blame the turmoil of politics. The occurrence of student protests is absolutely not due to the fault of a single or a small number of students.</p>
<p>A powerful enemy is pressing on the border, and the country is fragmented. The two incidents of September 18th and January 28th have filled everyone with blood and indignation. However, as soon as the Shanghai ceasefire agreement was signed, the domestic squabbles resumed. The country is in grave danger. In such an environment, can young students with keen senses concentrate on their studies? In recent years, the national economy has been declining day by day. Last year's massive floods submerged the whole country, and the rural economy was even more severely damaged. The people's livelihood is in an extremely difficult and tragic situation. To this day, there is no relief for the disaster areas, and the disaster victims are displaced and suffering, as if they are in a living hell. However, on the other hand, political leaders are still fighting for power and profit, and the extravagance and indulgence of urban residents remain the same. In such a situation, can young students concentrate on their studies? Even in terms of education itself, the government authorities have no long-term plans for education and do not know how to create a living education and a creative education, not to mention that even the minimum educational funding is often in arrears. The professors are left to fend for themselves, and the students appeal, but the government authorities still turn a blind eye. The country can spend more than 80% of its national currency annually to support more than two million troops. Political authorities can arbitrarily give huge sums of money to individuals and can use huge sums of money to build the chairman's official residence. However, this essential educational funding is in arrears for many years, causing schools to worry about closure. The leaders have no way to carry out their plans, and the professors are threatened with strikes in order to make a living. In such a situation, can young students concentrate on their studies?</p>
<p>Therefore, in our country today, there is actually no education. If politics does not get on track for one day, then education cannot be rectified for one day, and student protests will not be quelled for one day. This is inevitable and reasonable. If we simply blame the students for being noisy and unruly, it is to abandon the root and try to control the branches.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">Wang Jingwei and Others Fly to Xun <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>To Confer with Chiang on Military, Financial, and Diplomatic Matters</p>
<p>Departed Yesterday Morning, Arrived at Kuling in the Afternoon</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun held three meetings in Nanjing on the 13th with key figures from the central government to discuss major diplomatic strategies towards Japan. Considerable progress has been made, but due to the importance of the matter, it is necessary to meet with Chiang for further discussion and final decision. Therefore, it was decided that he, along with Li Shizeng, would take Chiang's private plane to Xun at noon on the 14th and then proceed to Kuling. Subsequently, Wang Jingwei, Luo Wengan, Li Jishen, and Huang Shaoxiong also found it necessary to confer with Chiang on military and political issues. They decided to travel with Gu on an ad hoc basis. At 11:30 a.m., Wang, Gu, and the other four arrived at the airport and boarded the plane. Chu Minyi, Zeng Zhongming, and others came to the airport to see them off. In a short time, they soared into the sky and sped away like lightning. It is estimated that they will arrive at Kuling before 3 p.m. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Seeking a Comprehensive Solution to All Problems <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Gu Weijun arrived in Nanjing, President Wang repeatedly convened meetings to discuss the policies and steps to be taken regarding the issue of the Northeast provinces. A general decision has been made, but it is still necessary to exchange opinions with Chairman Chiang to make a concrete decision. The initial plan was to fly to Xun from Nanjing to report to Chiang for instructions. Later, it was considered that the issue of the Northeast provinces is a matter of the survival of the entire nation, and in order to obtain a satisfactory solution, efforts should not only be made in diplomacy, but also comprehensive planning should be carried out for issues such as military and financial matters. Therefore, it was decided at the banquet hosted by Foreign Minister Luo on the evening of the 13th to recommend that President Wang, Foreign Minister Luo, Li Shizeng, Li Jishen, Huang Shaoxiong, and Gu Weijun jointly go to Xun to have a comprehensive discussion with Chairman Chiang, and also to send a telegram requesting that his private Ceres airplane be sent to Nanjing for them to travel in. At 7:30 a.m. on the 14th, Chairman Chiang sent pilot Smith to fly the plane from Xun to Nanjing. It landed at the airport at 10:50 a.m. Gu Weijun met with reporters at 9:30 a.m. At 10:15 a.m., Li Jishen was the first to arrive at the Lizhi Society. At 10:35 a.m., President Wang, Luo Wengan, Li Shizeng, and Huang Shaoxiong arrived one after another. Chen Gongbo, Gu Mengyu, Zeng Zhongming, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Jingjiang, Chu Minyi, Chen Shuren, Zhou Qigang, Shi Qingyang, Gan Naiguang, Jiang Zuobin, and representatives of various institutions also came one after another to see them off. After landing, the plane was refueled and thoroughly inspected. At 11:25 a.m., President Wang and others took a car from the Lizhi Society to the airport. Zeng Zhongming took a group photo of President Wang and the other five. Subsequently, President Wang was the first to board the plane, and Luo and others followed. Wang and Gu sat on the right side, and the two Lis sat on the left side. Luo was responsible for sitting in the back row. At 11:45 a.m., the plane took off. The well-wishers waved their hats in farewell. It is expected to arrive in Jiujiang before 3 p.m. There is no airport there, so they decided to land on the river, change to cars, and rush to Lushan to meet with Chiang. Wang and others could not stay long and would discuss important issues such as diplomacy, finance, and military affairs with Chiang in detail that night. If they could complete the discussions, they would return to Nanjing by the original plane on the morning of the 15th. Otherwise, they would hold another meeting on the morning of the 15th and decide to return to Nanjing in the afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Wang Jingwei's Remarks Before Departure <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei and others are scheduled to decide on all major plans at Kuling on the evening of the 14th and return to Nanjing by plane on the 15th. Before departing, he told people that the goal of negotiations with Japan is to maintain the integrity of national territory and sovereignty as the highest principle. However, future policies towards Japan must be shifted in light of environmental changes. Gu, as a representative, has returned from the Northeast and is making the problem increasingly serious. Although government officials have tentative countermeasures, they have not yet reached the stage of being announced. This trip to visit Chiang is for a serious exchange of opinions and further discussion. The inability to solve the financial problem is the biggest difficulty for the government. Song's resignation was indeed because the outflow could no longer be reduced, and the source could not be opened. Now, government officials are painstakingly planning and have made new decisions on the reorganization of finance, which can be expected to break the deadlock. However, this matter also needs to be discussed with Chiang. If there is a solution to the financial problem, Song can go to Beijing at any time. China has been subjected to external pressure, which is already unbearable. However, internal stability must come before resisting external aggression. If the banditry is not eliminated for one day, the government cannot concentrate on foreign affairs for one day. For example, after the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai, Chiang Tingwen's division was dispatched from Jiangxi to reinforce, and it was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on February 25. However, the division was held back by the Communist bandits and did not arrive on the Shanghai-Nanjing line until March 4. Because the division's journey was delayed by ten days, our army was attacked on both sides and had to retreat to the second line of defense. Therefore, this time, the division is determined to destroy the bandits and will not stop until they are completely annihilated. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Gu Weijun Will Come to Shanghai Within Days <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 15th, and then he will go to Shanghai with Liu Chongjie, Shi Zhaoji, You Mijian, and others to report to all sectors on the trip and try to concentrate the national strength to unite against foreign aggression in order to recover the lost territories in the Northeast. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu told reporters that his trip to Nanjing was purely to report on the results of the investigation in the Northeast provinces, assess the international situation, and contribute personal opinions based on the actual situation in the Northeast provinces. After several discussions in Beijing, a general decision has been made, but it is still necessary to exchange opinions with Chiang. Therefore, we are going to Xun together today. We were subjected to pressure and insults during our investigation in the Northeast, and our spirits were very painful. Our delegation also had two foreign consultants who also suffered all kinds of insults. The Japanese side no longer regards China as a country, nor the Chinese people as people. In fact, they see our country as a sheet of loose sand, with no strength at all, while the Japanese side has abundant strength. I have repeatedly stated that the issue of the Northeast provinces is a matter of life and death for our country. This is not deliberately alarmist. Just looking at history, there have been several instances where our country perished due to the turmoil in the Northeast. In modern times, the dealings between people and between countries are only about "emotion, reason, power, and force." In the event of a dispute, if it can be resolved with emotion, then use emotion. If emotion is not enough, then reason. If reason fails, then borrow power. If borrowing power fails, then use force. Disputes between people can still be adjudicated by the state. If one is not satisfied with the adjudication, then the state's power can be used to enforce it. However, although disputes between countries cannot be resolved by adjudication, there is still no force today that can enforce it. The League of Nations is an adjudication body, not an enforcement body. Therefore, it is a mistake to rely solely on the League of Nations to resolve disputes. We can appeal to the League of Nations to uphold justice, but to overcome national difficulties, we must first fully exert our own strength. Our country's door is wide open, and we are a sheet of loose sand. We are trying to resist here, but there is no movement there. One place implements severance of relations, while another place maintains diplomatic relations. This kind of situation is truly unprecedented in the world. Overcoming national difficulties cannot be done with empty talk. We must only work on the actual situation, unite sincerely, and unite against foreign aggression. All domestic disputes should be mutually sacrificed and no longer considered. We must never again have the mentality that the country has vast land and a large population and will never perish, nor should we have the mentality that if the Northeast provinces cannot be recovered in one year, then wait for three years, and if not in three years, then wait for five years, even ten or a hundred years. We must know that the 30 million Chinese people in the three Northeast provinces are already under the control of thousands of Japanese troops and have no power to resist. Modern science is advancing, and the methods of aggression by imperialists are also advancing accordingly. If this continues, I dare say that in a few years, the people of the three Northeast provinces will definitely be thoroughly assimilated by the Japanese and forget that they are Chinese people.

<h3 id="e6">Luo Wengan Discusses Sino-Japanese Disputes <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan told reporters that the result of the Sino-Japanese dispute lies in the Northeast issue, not the Shanghai issue. I have said it again and again that the Shanghai issue is like cutting a finger, which is not important. The Northeast issue is like lung disease, which is enough to cause death. Therefore, the people of the country should always keep the Northeast issue in mind, unite their strength, and unite against foreign aggression. Then, the country's future may be saved, otherwise the future is truly unimaginable. I went to Shanghai to inspect a few days ago. The scars of January 28 are still there, but the people's emotions are not much different from before the incident. Such forgetfulness is chilling. We handle diplomacy with the interests of the country and the people as the premise. Everything can be made public, but the use of diplomacy, before a policy is mature, often has to maintain confidentiality. If it is leaked, it will cause the effort to fall short. For the sake of the interests of the country and the people, it is also very regrettable. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>

After this meeting, it should be completely determined to implement a positive campaign to suppress the Communists. After returning to Beijing from Xun, I will go to Bengbu to supervise the suppression, so as to coordinate with Wuhan to form a large encirclement of the Communist bandits, in order to eliminate them in one fell swoop.

Wang and others' trip to Xun will have a comprehensive decision on diplomatic issues. I will go to Shanghai and then to Japan after Wang returns to Beijing and asks for instructions.

<p>(Nanjing) Li Shizeng told reporters that our trip is to have a concrete discussion with Chiang on diplomatic, financial, and military issues, so as to break the deadlock and find a way out for the country and the nation. After returning to Beijing, I will go abroad to France, because the International New Education Conference is scheduled to open in Paris on July 1st. The conference is imminent and I am eager to go.

<h3 id="e45">Lytton Speaks On <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Work of the Investigating Committee</p>
<p>In Tokyo and Beiping</p>
<p>Compiling the Final Report</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tonight, a foreign reporter visited Lord Lytton, who made the following remarks regarding the Investigating Committee's report:</p>
<h3 id="e46">Beidaihe and Qingdao are Not Suitable for Work <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>We have abandoned the idea of compiling the report in Beidaihe because the Japanese strongly opposed it and because the place is not very suitable. Both Beidaihe and Qingdao are good places for vacation, but working there is not ideal. Qingdao is unsuitable because the soil is too damp. However, the main reason for rejecting these two places is that most of our materials are in documents, which are now stored in Beiping and cannot be transported to Qingdao. Moreover, transportation between the two places would be too far.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Awaiting Gu Weijun's Return to Beiping <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The reporter asked when the Investigating Committee would go to Japan. Lord Lytton replied that they were waiting for Dr. Gu Weijun to return to Beiping from the south, which was expected around Friday or Saturday. The Investigating Committee hoped to go to Japan on June 22nd, but a decision could not be made until Dr. Gu returned to Beiping, as it was still uncertain whether he would go along.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Journey to Japan Will Be Via Korea <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Investigating Committee will probably take a train to Japan via Korea. All the investigators will make this trip together, but not all the staff will go. Several experts, whose discussions do not concern Japan, will remain in Beiping. While the investigators are in Japan, some staff will work on the historical part of the report. The report will be divided into several chapters, one of which will list the Investigating Committee's recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="e49">The Report Will Be Written in English <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The report will be written in English and published simultaneously in China and Japan in the future. It will first describe the historical origins of the dispute, with the historical part containing criticism. Then, it will comment on all the conditions and finally propose solutions based on history.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Purpose of This Trip to Japan <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this trip to Japan is to discuss our resolutions. Last time in Japan, we asked the Japanese to inform us of the interests of the Japanese in Manchuria and the situation there, which they considered important. We only knew a little about this from newspapers and conversations. This time, we are visiting Japan again, with the benefit of our travels and conversations in Manchuria. However, the purpose of our visit to Japan is still mainly to inquire again from the Japanese about everything, rather than to inform them of our observations. We do not want to say to the Japanese, "We intend to suggest this or that," because we still want to hear from them.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Resolutions of the Report <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Lord Lytton emphasized that the resolutions of the report will be the main issue for discussion in Japan. We cannot begin to deliberate until we have discussed this with the Japanese government.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Must Be Delivered to the League of Nations by the End of August <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>As soon as our work is completed, we will return to Beiping. The League of Nations wants to see the report before convening the General Assembly in September, so it must be received by the end of August so that it can be printed and distributed to the members of the League of Nations for discussion before the meeting. We are now trying to deliver this report to the League of Nations by the end of August, but it may be delayed until mid-September because a large amount of documentary evidence needs to be incorporated into the book.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Possibility of Agreement by Both Parties <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>We intend to try to find the possibility of agreement by the changing parties until the last hour, but I dare not be sure that we can say to the League of Nations, "We have made some suggestions for agreement by both China and Japan." Lord Lytton concluded, "The League of Nations may, as a result of our report and recommendations, say to both parties, 'Are you willing to negotiate on the basis of this report?'" (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Work Will Begin in Tokyo <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Lord Lytton announced tonight that the final report of the Investigating Committee will not be written entirely in any one place. This work will begin in Tokyo and end in Beiping, as only that place can access all the related documents. Only a part of the work is drafting, and only a few people can engage in drafting at any one time. The investigators will work at any time when it is convenient. First, after the preparations are completed, they will meet on schedule to discuss the draft. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>China and Russia Plan to Conclude</p>
<p>A Non-Aggression Treaty</p>
<p>Principles Proposed by Our Side</p>
<p>Taking the Spirit of the Russian-German and Russian-Turkish Treaties</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain diplomatic authority said that regarding the conclusion of a mutual non-aggression treaty with Russia, Wang had instructed the diplomatic authorities to examine and translate the recent treaties of this kind concluded by the Soviet Union with various countries for research. It is found that the Soviet Union has concluded many non-aggression treaties with various countries since 1917, including the 1925 Russian-Turkish Neutrality Treaty, valid for only one year, the 1926 Russian-German Neutrality Treaty, valid for three years, and the same year, the Soviet Union and Afghanistan concluded a Neutrality Treaty, valid for three years, the same year, the Soviet Union and Lysiania concluded a non-aggression treaty, valid for five years, especially the 1931 non-aggression treaty concluded between the Soviet Union and France, the significance is even more significant, it can be seen that the term of non-aggression treaties concluded between the two countries is usually very short, and the two sides are satisfied upon expiration and can be extended. Our country will adopt the spirit of the Russian-German and Russian-Turkish non-aggression treaties, and its principles are as follows: (1) The contracting countries bear the obligation not to infringe upon each other. (2) Even if one of the contracting countries maintains a peaceful attitude, if it is attacked by a third party or two or more countries, the other contracting country must maintain neutrality throughout the dispute record. (3) If political and economic pressure is applied to one of the contracting countries, and a third country organizes a union or agreement, the other contracting country must not join such a union. (4) The two contracting countries have the obligation not to interfere in internal affairs, and must not have propaganda activities. (5) If a dispute arises between the contracting countries and cannot be resolved by ordinary diplomatic means, it should be handled by an arbitration mechanism by peaceful means. The preliminary draft proposed by our side is roughly based on this. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Round Table Conference is Cancelled</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan said that although the Japanese side has been releasing air from time to time regarding the round table conference, it has in fact become a thing of the past. When this proposal first arose, the government thought that if the Japanese side had sincerity, an international conference could be held, and the Northeast problem between China and Japan could be reasonably resolved. Now that the Japanese side has no sincerity, this matter has been cancelled. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Jiangsu Provincial Committee Resigns En Masse <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Reason Lies Entirely in Finance</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu Provincial Committee resigned because there was no solution to the financial problem. The Executive Yuan has telegraphed to retain them and will definitely not insist on resigning. According to important financial figures, it is true that Jiangsu Province's finances are extremely strained after the war. The provincial government's initial intention was to implement a special tax, which could bring in one million per month, but it was difficult to make a decisive decision due to the ban on smoking. Therefore, the plan of a certain Cantonese man to contract for one million yuan was suspended. Later, it was proposed that the provincial government control the stamp duty on tobacco and alcohol, but the ministry said that the national tax had already been ordered by the government and could not be used, so it was inconvenient to set a precedent. The Provincial Committee could not raise any more funds locally, so they resigned en masse to the government. It is believed that if the Ministry of Finance can provide some assistance or issue some arrears, the problem will be resolved. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e121">Key Figures from England and France Arrive in Geneva <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>To Open the Stalemate of the Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Technical Discussions Tangled, Resolved by Political Solutions</p>
<p>MacDonald Will Propose a Ten-Year Arms Holiday Plan</p>
<p>National Press Agency dispatch from Geneva, 13th: Following the arrival in Geneva tonight of English and French disarmament leaders MacDonald, Simon, and Herriot, public attention has once again focused on the long-dormant disarmament negotiations. It is widely reported that the disarmament conference is now entering a period of resolution, with important decisions expected within the next two to three months. Surprisingly, Grandi arrived here earlier today and had a long discussion with Nadolny, the leader of the German delegation. Nadolny then visited and spoke at greater length with Lunacharsky of the Russian delegation. Grandi also met with Lunacharsky. It is reported that their discussions centered on the current stagnation of the arms conference and the need to break the deadlock. It is believed that when Grandi, Nadolny, and the English and French leaders meet tomorrow, they will strongly advocate for this issue, and it is expected that the British Prime Minister will propose a ten-year arms holiday plan. Today, the Vox Populi Association, a coalition of international peace organizations, passed a resolution under the chairmanship of Henderson, the chairman of the disarmament conference, demanding significant reductions in nominal armaments, the prohibition of all aggressive weapons, and international control of arms manufacturing. The resolution was immediately submitted to the British Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Geneva, 13th: Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson told representatives of international disarmament groups today that the disarmament issue must be resolved by politicians, not experts. The disarmament conference has not failed. Although progress has not been as expected, optimism is still warranted.</p>

<p>England and France Reconcile Opinions</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Geneva, 14th: Upon arriving here, French Prime Minister Herriot told reporters, "What we need now is just one method." It is widely believed that due to strategic considerations, the English and French prime ministers prefer to underestimate the value of matters they have already agreed upon rather than exaggerate them. News of Herriot's remarks further confirms that the resolution of issues such as reparations, war debts, and disarmament seems to be gradually taking shape and will soon be resolved smoothly. It is reported that France no longer insists on the payment of the remaining reparations, thereby facilitating a decision to extend the moratorium. After the US Congress can demonstrate a unified opinion and sincerity in disarmament among European nations and satisfy US critics by revising its policies, a final solution for reparations will be determined. It is speculated that England and France will use a temporary and practical plan that can be made permanent to resolve the disarmament issue, urging other countries to join unanimously. It is reported that key points already agreed upon by Herriot and MacDonald include reducing military expenditure budgets by one-tenth, or suspending armaments for several years, or implementing both plans simultaneously. In 1924, English and French relations were closest because MacDonald and Herriot's political views aligned. Unfortunately, the French elections that year hindered the promising cooperation between these two great statesmen. However, the situation in France today is different from before, which is a good sign.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Future of Lausanne Conference <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Hinges on the Attitudes of France and Germany</p>
<p>The World Press Agency reports that the Tokyo Jiji Shimpo recently published an article discussing the difficulties of the Lausanne Conference, focusing on the attitudes of Germany and France. It stated that although the United States does not participate in this conference, it still holds a dominant position regarding war debts and naturally pays attention to the conference. However, due to the profound experience of the economic downturn, public opinion in the US is advocating for the government to reduce or even cancel war debts. Financial capitalists holding large amounts of debt from Germany also generally agree with this, as it would make it easier to recover their debts from Germany if the US government reduces or cancels war debts. As for England, it also sympathizes with Germany's position. Lloyd George, who participated in the signing of the war debt reparations treaty, advocated in his recent book "The Truth About the Reparations Problem" that (1) war debts and reparations to which the Hoover moratorium plan applies should be permanently abolished, and (2) the necessity of German annual reparations payments (based on the Dawes and Young plans) beyond public debt. The attitudes of Germany and France are indeed the difficulties of this conference. France still maintains its opposition attitude towards Germany, insisting on strict implementation of the Treaty of Versailles. During the Brūning cabinet in Germany, there was still a trace of sincerity regarding the reparations issue. Now that Brūning has lost power, the future of reparations has become bleak. Hitler's National Socialist Party has always advocated the abandonment of the Treaty of Versailles. If Hitler were to hold power, there would be no hope of reparations fulfillment. The current ruler is von Papen, but von Papen has considerable connections with Hitler's faction. As Lloyd George said, "A civilian government like Brūning's cannot pay reparations, and a National Socialist or Communist government under Hitler does not want to pay." In short, regardless of who holds power in Germany, reparations fulfillment will inevitably be difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Austria's Loan Negotiations with Creditor Nations Break Down <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>National Press Agency dispatch from Vienna, 13th: Austria's largest bank, the Creditanstalt, faced liquidity problems in May of last year due to excessive non-performing loans and the impact of the economic downturn. On June 16th, the Austrian government intervened and guaranteed all of the bank's liabilities, allowing foreign banks to extend the short-term loans granted to the bank, totaling approximately US$81 million, for two years. Subsequently, the government sent representatives to consult with the Foreign Creditor Nations Committee on the bank's foreign debt restructuring plan. Recently, the Austrian government proposed to convert the bank's existing foreign debt into a national loan, to be repaid over forty years, with the first ten years repaying 5 million Austrian schillings annually (approximately US$700,000) and the next ten years repaying 12 million Austrian schillings annually. However, the Foreign Creditor Nations Committee refused to accept this proposal, and a formal statement declaring the breakdown of negotiations was issued today.</p>

<p>Motion to Recognize the Puppet State</p>
<p>Parliament Scheduled to Adjourn Today</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society dispatch from Tokyo, 14th: The House of Representatives plenary session presented its final agenda item at 2:00 PM today, namely the resolution to recognize Manchukuo. Kodama (Seiyukai) took the stage to explain the reasons for the proposal, first stating that the people of the nation unanimously expect the development of Manchukuo, then criticizing Japanese diplomacy for following the aggressive diplomacy of European and American nations. Later, he strongly advocated for the right of self-defense, stating that the Japanese people rose up because of the Liutiao Lake Incident, all due to the incompetence of Japanese diplomacy, which resulted in the backlash of the Japanese people's legitimate powers. He then discussed Manchukuo, saying that it is an intermediate country for the common reconstruction of Eastern culture by the Chinese and Japanese people, and that Japan's recognition of Manchukuo is required by justice and belief and is the general will of the Japanese people. He also stated that he hoped to recognize Manchukuo as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Sando Kyoichi (Minseito) took the stage and stated that the independence of Manchukuo cannot be denied due to the facts. Recognition requires preparation, and this preparation should not take too long. If neighboring Japan does not recognize Manchuria, it will discourage the Manchurian people, resulting in hindering the independence of Manchuria. If Japan recognizes Manchukuo, England, the United States, and other countries should not have any objections. He also requested immediate recognition. Later, Kamei Kanichiro (Social Democratic) gave a speech in support, discussing world peace and confirming the self-determination of ethnic minorities. Afterward, those in favor were asked to stand, and the entire assembly stood, passing the bill.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society dispatch from Tokyo, 14th: After the House of Representatives plenary session confirmed the resolution to recognize Manchukuo, it presented 77 proposals and 242 petitions. At 3:00 PM, it adjourned for a recess and reopened at 5:00 PM, passing the preferential treatment bill for disabled soldiers, war-wounded veterans, and their families regarding train and ship travel, as well as 77 other bills. Later, Speaker Akita thanked the members for their efforts, and the meeting adjourned at 5:23 PM. The closing ceremony is scheduled to be held at 11:00 AM tomorrow.</p>

<p>Reuters dispatch from Santiago, 13th: Competition within the Chilean revolutionary government is fierce. Although government member Dávila has resigned, the political turmoil has not yet subsided. Dávila's resignation was caused by the expulsion of the left-wing faction, which accused him of being too lenient towards foreign businesses, especially nitrate companies. Newspapers have strongly attacked Dávila for this matter, seemingly instigated by Dávila's political enemies. In addition, the left-wing faction also blamed Dávila for attempting to restore former President Ibáñez.</p>

<p>Firmly Opposes Repeal of Prohibition</p>
<p>National Press Agency dispatch from Washington, 13th: The Associated Press has learned from highly reliable sources that President Hoover has agreed to be a candidate for President and has decided to make the issue of resubmitting the Prohibition Act to a public referendum one of the Republican Party's platforms. He firmly opposes the direct repeal of the Act. If the repeal faction does not make a stronger showing in the next few days, Hoover intends to publicly state his opposition to the immediate repeal of the constitutional amendment regarding alcohol prohibition. Leaders of the Prohibition faction, such as Senator Borah, recently visited the White House to persuade the President to join the Prohibition faction's organization, but Hoover refused. Following the trend of domestic public opinion, he is willing to submit the constitutional amendment to a public referendum. Therefore, Borah has lost this assistance and has decided not to go to Chicago to participate in the Republican primary convention.</p>

<p>Military and Political Officials of Hubei Go Together</p>
<p>He Jian Also Passes Through Hankou En Route to Lushan</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, departed from Nanjing on the 7th aboard the warship Yingrui and arrived in Jiujiang on the 8th. On the 9th, he ascended Guling, and there were immediate reports of a summoning of the Lushan Bandit Suppression Conference. Here, Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun, Rural Clearance Director Xu Yuanquan, Provincial Government Chairman Xia Doutin, Preparation Commander Ye Peng, 13th Army Commander Qian Dajun, 88th Division Commander Yu Jishi, Headquarters Transportation Director Lin Xiang, 13th Division Commander Wan Yaohuang, 44th Division Commander Xiao Zhichu, Civil Affairs Director Zhu Huaibing, Finance Director Shen Zhaonian, Construction Director Li Shucheng, Rural Clearance Association President Fang Benren, and Pinghan Railway Bureau Chief He Jingwu were all summoned. He Chengjun, Xu Yuanquan, Xia Doutin, Ye Peng, Qian Dajun, Yu Jishi, Lin Xiang, Li Shucheng, He Jingwu, Fang Benren, and others boarded the Jihe Wheel eastward at 9:00 PM on the 12th. Pacification Commissioner affairs were handled by Chief of Staff Yang Shuankui, Chief Advisor Zhu Chuanjing, and Office Director Chen Guangzu, jointly. The headquarters of the 10th Army was handled by Chief of Staff Yang Shaodong. The command of the bandit suppression front was the responsibility of Deputy Commander Ma Dengying and Division Commander Zhang Zhenhan. Before his departure, He Chengjun told reporters, "This trip to Xunyang is due to a telegram summons from Chairman Chiang, who has inquiries about the bandit suppression situation in Hubei Province. I will return after official business is completed, and I am scheduled to descend the mountain on the 14th and return to Hankou by plane on the 15th." Xu Yuanquan said, "After requesting instructions from Chiang, I will go to the Yingcheng front to supervise the suppression of the remaining bandits, striving for a complete eradication." The Jihe Wheel set sail that evening and arrived in Xunyang on the morning of the 13th. According to a telegram from there, Chiang sent his Chief of Staff Wang Shihe to the wharf to welcome them. At noon, they took a car to Lotus Cave and then transferred to sedan chairs to ascend the mountain. The Bandit Suppression Conference was held that evening. Zhu Huaibing was originally inspecting in Tianmen, but upon hearing the summons, he returned to the province and decided to take the Dehe Wheel eastward with Shen Zhaonian, Wan Yaohuang, Xiao Zhichu, and others on the evening of the 13th. It happened that He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army and Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, was also summoned and passed through Hankou, so they traveled together. According to He Jian's conversation with reporters, "I received news of Chairman Chiang's departure from Nanjing and intended to come to Hankou to greet him. Later, I received a telegram from Director Hu Xiehui, stating that Chairman Chiang's arrival in Hankou was uncertain, and the military and government affairs in Hunan Province were complicated, so it was inconvenient to leave early. Upon receiving Chairman Chiang's telegram summons, I was asked about the bandit suppression situation in Hunan Province, so I took a special train to Hankou on the evening of the 12th to transfer to Lushan. As for the recent bandit suppression situation in Hunan Province, in the southern part of Hunan, Division Commander Liu Jianxu of the 28th Division has been urging the various divisions to carry out strict joint suppression, and the remaining bandits can be wiped out within days. The western part of Hunan is relatively peaceful, and scattered small bandits are being searched by Chen Quzhen's troops. The scattered bandits in eastern Hunan are being jointly attacked by the divisions of Chen Guangzhong, Peng Weiren, etc., in cooperation with the various armies of Jiangxi Province, which is not a problem. As for the various counties bordering Hunan and Hubei, I have followed the order of Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun and ordered Li Jue's 19th Division to actively carry out joint suppression." Zhu Huaibing and Shen Zhaonian also had conversations. Zhu Huaibing said that through this inspection, he learned that bandit suppression should focus on pacifying the people. He will report to Chairman Chiang on this trip and request instructions on stabilizing society and relieving the people's livelihood to achieve a lasting solution. Shen Zhaonian said that Hubei Province is facing financial difficulties, and many government affairs cannot be carried out. He will ask Chairman Chiang to request a monthly subsidy of 500,000 yuan from the central government to provide financial support. At this point, the whistle had already sounded, and the ship was about to set sail, so he said goodbye. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Xunyang on the 14th, and all can reach Lushan by noon. He Jian is a member of Hunan Province who bears heavy responsibility for military and political affairs. The Bandit Suppression Conference may not be held until He Jian arrives. (June 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e133">Red Bandits Invade Eastern Hubei <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Wuxue's Situation Extremely Critical</p>
<p>The Bandits in Tianmen and Qianjiang Have Been Heavily Defeated</p>
<p>Following the Fall of Guangji, Huangmei and Wuxue are in Extreme Danger</p>
<p>A Hankou dispatch reports that the military suppression of bandits in Hubei Province has recently become extremely tense. In the central Hubei area, the largest concentration of bandits is in the area of HuahLiu River near Zaoshi in Tianmen County. The 48th Division of the 10th Army, along with Zhang Zhenhan's 41st Division and Xiao Zhichu's 44th Division, jointly surrounded and suppressed them. After seven days and nights of bloody battle, no less than 17,000 bandits were killed. It is also rumored that the bandit leader, Duan Dechang, was wounded and killed in this battle. As for the suppression of the He bandits' lair in Qianjiang, it is being carried out by the Sichuan Army, with Wang Lingji in command. They have divided into four routes to advance. The first route, under Guo Xun, engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits at Zhoujiaji. The second route, under Commander Zhang, engaged in fierce fighting with He Long himself at Xia Banghu. The third route, under Commander Fan, engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits at Longwan. The fourth route, under Commander Tong, engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits at Chentuokou. The fighting in the Xia Banghu area was particularly fierce. On the 13th, this office received a telegram from Guo Xun, stating that since the 7th, he had been fighting with He Duan in the Guankou, Meijialing, and Zhaojiatai areas southwest of Qianjiang, fighting hard until the evening of the 11th before defeating the bandits. They immediately occupied Qianjiang County. The bandit forces retreated toward Tuochuanbu and are currently being pursued. The bandits suffered extremely heavy losses this time, with casualties estimated at over 2,000, and so on. This telegram was sent from Qianjiang, so it should be reliable. However, the situation in eastern Hubei has suddenly become tense again. The counties in eastern Hubei are half connected to Henan and half bordering Anhui. Except for Huang'an, which is still in the hands of the bandits, the other counties are relatively peaceful. On the 13th, it was suddenly reported that the 25th Army, part of the Red Bandit's Fourth Front Army, claiming to have two divisions, had bypassed Yingshan via Ximaban in Qishui and were advancing on Huanggang. Guangji County fell on the 12th. Huangmei is in imminent danger. County Magistrate Gui Fu Cang is supervising the troops to defend the city while also telegraphing the Civil Affairs Department to request assistance from the Pacification Headquarters. However, it is said that the Red Bandits are very powerful and will not be satisfied with just taking Huanggang. Their slogan is to meet in Wuhan. Therefore, after the fall of Guangji, Wuxue, which belongs to the county, is also in a precarious situation. Wuxue is an important town in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and its preservation is essential for both military and transportation purposes. Representatives from the local chamber of commerce, Guo Renqiu, Xu Zhuozhai, Zhong Shaolian, and Ku Hantao, traveled day and night to Hankou. At 2:00 PM on the 13th, they went to the Pacification Headquarters to report. Because He Chengjun had gone to Lushan, the Chief of Staff, Yang Kuiyi, received them. The representatives reported that the Zhang Wanxin troops stationed in Wuxue were weak and in a very dangerous situation. They requested that capable troops be dispatched quickly to rescue them. Yang replied that there were sufficient preparations to suppress the bandits in eastern Hubei. The Du Brigade of the 47th Division, which arrived in Hankou on the 12th, has already gone to garrison the area to assist in the suppression as the opportunity arises. The entire unit has arrived, and more troops will continue to arrive in the coming days. The defense of the river surface will be handled by Zeng Yiding, commander of the Second Fleet stationed in Hankou, who will dispatch the Yongsheng warship to suppress the situation. The defense of Wuxue will be further consolidated, and so on. The representatives were satisfied with the results and left. That evening, the Pacification Headquarters received a telegram from Dong Jianbo, regimental commander of the 34th Division in Wuxue, stating that two regiments of Shangguan Yunxiang's troops had arrived, and the people's hearts were stable. According to some sources, Shangguan himself has decided to go to Wuxue on the 14th to direct and supervise the suppression. The division sent to Hankou this time is the First Brigade, the Second Brigade, and the division headquarters personnel, who are continuing to travel west from Nanjing and are expected to arrive completely around the 15th. After that, they will be stationed in Wuxue. In addition, the 54th Division, under Hao Mengling, will also leave Jiangxi for Hubei to garrison eastern Hubei and assist in the suppression. Although the bandits are brave, they will not be able to do anything.</p>
<p>The Pacification Headquarters, in its eagerness to suppress the bandits this time, is anxious to rectify military discipline and win over the people's hearts. On the 7th, it received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, relaying instructions to all armies regarding the policy of not punishing those who were coerced into joining the bandits in the recovered areas. On the 8th, it ordered all armies to rectify military discipline, focus on practical education, and assist the people in self-defense. Furthermore, in the past, the army had raised funds locally, with many names and nothing but exactions. The people were greatly distressed, and the army could not support itself. At this time of tense bandit suppression, this should be taken as a profound warning. On the 12th, it also issued separate instructions to the bandit suppression units to strictly prohibit this practice. (June 13th)</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army</p>
<p>The First Batch Arrives in Quanzhou</p>
<p>The Fuzhou Pacification Headquarters is Being Organized</p>
<p>The Red Bandits Flee from Longyan Again</p>
<p>A Fuzhou dispatch reports that the first batch of the 19th Route Army, which came from Jiangsu to Fujian to suppress bandits, Mao Weishou's division, totaling over 12,000 men, arrived in Quanzhou on the 7th, 8th, and 9th, disembarking from Xiutu Port and garrisoning inside and outside Quanzhou City. Merchants and civilians along the way set off firecrackers to express their welcome. The ships continued to go to Zhenjiang to load the second batch, Qu Shounian's division, to Fujian. It is reported that the army temporarily plans to garrison in Tong'an, Haicheng, Jinjiang, and other counties, and will be redeployed after Commander Cai Tingkai arrives. However, the people of Zhangzhou are very eager for the army to enter Zhangzhou as soon as possible because they distrust Zhang Zhen's division. On the 11th, the provincial government specially appointed Commissioner Lin Zhiyuan as the Special Commissioner for Post-War Affairs in Zhangzhou to go to Zhangzhou to assist Zhang Zhen in receiving the 19th Route Army and to observe the situation. If Zhang Zhen's position is indeed difficult, he will temporarily take over the 49th Division to await the central government's resolution. Furthermore, after Zhangzhou was recovered, various miscellaneous troops used the name of bandit suppression to set up their own banners and disturb the local area, which should also be dealt with as soon as possible to avoid harming the people.</p>
<p>As for the Fuzhou Pacification Headquarters, it is reported that Jiang Guangnai will first send Zhang Xiang to Fujian to organize it. Most of the personnel used are transferred from the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Commander's Office. The site has been selected at the old site of the Military Governor's Office on Dongmen Street. It is said that Zhang Xiang will be appointed as the Chief of Staff. However, the provincial government is still having difficulty raising funds for bandit suppression. It is said that there is news of requesting Guangdong to bear part of the expenses. According to Chen Jitang, if the two divisions of the Guangdong Army currently stationed on the Fujian border can be withdrawn, half of the bandit suppression expenses required by the 19th Route Army in Fujian can be borne. It is still under discussion. It is not confirmed that the Huang Renhuan and Huang Yanzhen divisions have withdrawn from Wuping, Shanghang, and Yongding.</p>
<p>After the Red Bandits withdrew from Zhangzhou to Longyan, it is reported that they have fled again. According to reliable sources in Longyan, the bandits' heavy equipment and wounded soldiers were transported elsewhere long ago. On the 2nd and 3rd, the bandits did move towards the Longmen area. Before leaving, they shot 11 people in Longyan. Another group of over 500 people left for Nanyangba on the morning of the 3rd. Their destination is unknown. Only about 1,000 local Red bandits remain in Longyan City to guard it. Observing the bandits' movements, they will either flee back to Tinglian or harass Hangyong. The bandits in Longyan claimed that they were going to attack Dapu and enter the Dongjiang River. It is not known whether this is a feint or if they have other intentions. The bandits in the Kanshi area have not yet withdrawn. After the security teams searched and suppressed the areas near Shizhong, there were no traces of bandits, and local order has been restored. The traffic from Zhangzhou to Shizhong has also been restored. The security team has sent telephone soldiers to repair the telegraph wires along the Zhangzhou road, so Shizhong and Zhangzhou can now communicate. In addition, seven bandits who escaped from Longyan brought three Type 38 rifles, three Type 30 rifles, and one Russian-made Type 79 rifle to Shizhong and surrendered to the security team. According to them, life among the bandits is very difficult. Now that they hear they are returning to Jiangxi, many are unwilling to go, and many are escaping, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Zhejiang and Jiangxi Joint Suppression of Fang Bandits <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Fang Zhizheng Suffers a Disastrous Defeat in a Fierce Attack on Shangrao</p>
<p>The Bandit Organizations in Geyuan Are All Bombed</p>
<p>A Nanchang dispatch reports that Fang Zhimin, the Red Bandit in eastern Jiangxi, is the chairman of the pseudo-Jiangbei Revolutionary Committee and the pseudo-Xinjiang Soviet. Since 1927, he has been active in Yiyang, Hengfeng, Guixi, Qianshan, Shangrao, Dexing, Fuliang, Leping, and Wannan. The Xinjiang and Raohe river basins have suffered immeasurably. Recently, this bandit led the pseudo-10th Army under Zhou Jianping to capture Hengfeng, and his power became even more rampant. A few days ago, he besieged Dexing for five days. Because the Li Division and Zhang Brigade firmly defended the city, he failed and retreated to his old lair in Hengfeng, but he still harassed the nearby counties, causing unspeakable suffering. He Yingqin then transferred Jiang Dingwen's troops from Zhejiang to advance towards Yushan, and Zhou Hunyuan's division advanced from Jinxi towards Guixi, joining the Li and Wang divisions originally stationed in eastern Jiangxi to encircle and suppress the Fang bandits. The Fang bandits were surrounded on all sides, so they again used the old trick of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak. Before the arrival of all the divisions, they used all their strength to pounce on Wang Jinwen's division, hoping to defeat the division, capture Shangrao, and join forces with Deng Qi, Huang Dao, and other bandits in Qianshan, preparing to retreat to Fujian (Qianshan borders Chong'an in Fujian). According to military reports from Hekou, about 20,000 Fang and Shao bandits are gathered in Hengfeng, with 3,000 rifles, machine guns, mortars, and artillery of all kinds. On the 6th of this month, they attacked Shangrao with all their forces, and the fire was extremely fierce. The reason for this is that since the bandits occupied Luojiaqiao and Yinjiafang, they cut off the telegraph and telephone lines from Shangrao to Hekou to cut off official communication and supplies. On the other hand, they divided into three sides from Longtan, Zhuxi Bridge, and other places to attack Raocheng. After receiving the warning, Division Commander Wang Jinwen, together with Brigade Commander Hua Musheng, personally led the Li and Wang regiments to meet the enemy in different directions. At the same time, he used radio to order the Hekou Division Headquarters to dispatch troops stationed in the area to advance to Liulukou to take a pincer attack. After the arrangements were made, the fighting began. The bandits advancing head-on from Heng to Rao fired their rifles and cannons, and their attack was very fierce. Wang's army calmly responded and did not move. The troops directly under the Division Headquarters, which bypassed the bandits' rear from Hekou, launched a fierce charge against the bandits. After five or six hours of fierce fighting, the bandits, because they were attacked from both sides, suffered heavy casualties and retreated to the Hengfeng border that night. But the bandits were still not discouraged and mobilized a large number of peasant bandits and rifle bandits to reinforce them. On the 7th and 8th, the counterattack became even more intense. On the morning of the 8th, Division Commander Wang changed his strategy because it was difficult to win from the front. He ordered the Li Regiment of the division to leave Longtan and Zhuxi Bridge, copy the bandits' right wing, and cooperate with the frontal encirclement and attack. At the same time, the air force team sent by the headquarters also soared in the sky and threw bombs at the dense ranks of the Fang bandits, killing many bandits. The bandits were forced by the planes and retreated to Gaokeng Shuangxikou in the northwest. The Li and Wang regiments took advantage of the victory and advanced more than 20 li deep into the Hengfeng border. In this battle, many bandits were killed and many guns, flags, and military supplies were seized. Division Commander Wang has already telegraphed a victory report yesterday. In addition to replying with praise, Minister He also ordered a thorough pursuit and suppression to achieve complete success. In addition, the Civil Affairs Department received a telegram from Peng Fusu, the magistrate of Qianshan County, stating that the Zou Qi bandits, a part of the Fang bandits, led more than 1,000 bandits with 500 to 600 guns to besiege the joint teams of the first and second districts of Xiangu Ridge in the county on the 26th of last month, attempting to seize their guns. The teams immediately came out to meet them. They were then reinforced by the teams from Longpao Mountain and other places, and they defeated the bandits. Later, the Huang Dao bandits on the south bank of the Qian River joined forces with the Zou bandits. The teams were weak and afraid that they were not their opponents, so they telegraphed the province for assistance. However, according to military sources, He Yingqin had already decided on a complete plan to suppress the Fang bandits in eastern Jiangxi. Zhou's division has arrived in Guixi, Jiang's division has arrived in Jiangxi from Zhejiang, and the Wang and Li divisions are also making arrangements and will begin the encirclement and suppression in a few days. Moreover, the aviation team bombed the bandits' bases in Hengfeng and Geyuan with dozens of heavy bombs one after another on Jiang Yu and other days, and all the pseudo-organizations were destroyed. According to a captured bandit from a certain division headquarters, the planes dropped bombs in Geyuan on the 7th and landed inside the pseudo-Northeast Soviet government, collapsing many houses, killing more than 20 important bandits, and injuring even more. The nearby arsenal was also bombed by the planes, and the surviving bandits fled like crows and beasts. (June 11th)</p>

<p>Escaped Soldiers Surrounded and Arrested on the Bank of Qiugong: Near the Qiugong bank of the Nanshuang Temple in the 15th district of the county, a boat was moored at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning. There were six escaped soldiers in it, four with rifles and two unarmed. The villagers were suspicious and reported to the 1st squad of the 2nd squadron of the police brigade in the town. Special Agent Shi Fengqi led seven officers and five road protection soldiers to arrest them. However, when the escaped soldiers saw the police officers arriving, they first fled, and then took advantage of the terrain and opened fire to resist arrest. The police and soldiers also opened fire. After an hour of fierce fighting, the escaped soldiers were defeated and fled. One was shot and wounded and groaned in a pool of blood, and one was killed. The other four were also arrested. According to their confession, the wounded man was named Ma Zhonghua, and the other four were named Yang Chunhua, Li Guituan, Wu Yuemei, and Ye Shuting. They were all soldiers of the 9th company of the 54th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the 10th Division. When the troops were stationed in Jiaxing, Wu and Ye had asked for a month's leave and went to Wuxi with a friend from Qingshan Bay. Now that their leave was over, they planned to go to the 19th Route Army, but were arrested on the way, and so on. They were immediately sent to the city for strict interrogation.</p>
<p>Silk Factories Request Rent Reduction: Wuxi Chengfeng, Shengyu, Yingyi, Dafeng, Yeqin, Santai, Yuanyi, Defeng, Zhengyi, Yifeng, Yisheng, Yufeng, Yusheng, Housheng and other silk factories have been renting factories for business. Because of the years of failure and the national crisis, the silk factories have closed and production has stopped.

<p>Large Number of Scattered Soldiers Arrive in the Countryside and Cause Trouble: Xianshengqiao Town, in the second district of the county, is an important town in the northeast countryside. On the morning of the 12th of this month, 32 people in military uniforms who looked like scattered soldiers suddenly came. They each carried a rifle. After arriving in the town, they bought kerosene and straw, saying that they wanted to burn down the entire town. At that time, residents and merchants were extremely panic and moved important items elsewhere. Then, the town chief, Chen Linxian, came forward to negotiate. The scattered soldiers demanded 1,000 silver dollars before they would leave. After repeated negotiations, they were given four silver dollars each. According to the soldiers, they were separated from the team and could not find it. They now intend to cross the river to Shanghai, and so on. At the same time, nearby residents reported this to the Zhenyu patrol ship anchored at Fukou. The ship immediately flew to Xianshengqiao to be on alert. Therefore, the scattered soldiers did not go north, but returned to Maojiaqiao with their weapons.</p>

<p>Provincial Committee Comes to Nantong to Force Collection of House Tax: The provincial government believes that the house rent tax collected in Nantong is still less than 8,000 yuan, so it specially commissioned Huang Baipeng to come to Nantong to join with the county government to force the collection from house to house.</p>
<p>Sea Bandits Rampant in Daan Port: In the Daan Hong area at the junction of Tonghai, a large group of sea bandits has been operating recently. There are more than 40 bandit ships and more than 600 bandits. In addition to robbing on the river, because the fishing season has passed, fishermen are unwilling to buy fake flag licenses, so they threaten to burn their boats. In recent days, kidnapping cases have occurred frequently in nearby towns. The magistrates of Tonghai County have agreed to mobilize the water and land police teams to suppress them.</p>
<p>Funding Issues for the 25th Route Army: The 25th Route Army under Liang Guanying has a monthly salary of 200,000 yuan. In addition to a part allocated by the provincial government, the rest is borrowed from the counties north of the Yangtze River. Commander Liang has sent Senators Zhu and Han to Nantong to borrow 100,000 yuan from the Chamber of Commerce. The original letter said, "The funds for our army were originally issued by the central government on a monthly basis. However, due to the national crisis, the national treasury is empty, and the amount has been reduced repeatedly, and it is less than one-third of the original amount and cannot be issued as scheduled. The two thousand officers and soldiers of our army are in an unsustainable situation. Therefore, Senator Zhu Zeqing and Senator Han Shaoshi are specially sent to your association to borrow 100,000 yuan to maintain the emergency," and so on. This amount is currently being borrowed by the industrial and banking sectors for 20,000 yuan. The rest is being borrowed by the districts, but it is difficult to collect it all at once.</p>

<p>Eighteen Merchant Guilds from Huai River Come to Yangzhou to Petition: On the matter of Wang Zhanghu, the Transport Envoy of the Lianghuai Salt District, coming to Yangzhou to improve the salt affairs on the four banks of Hubei, Hunan, western Anhui, and Anhui, the 18 merchant guilds from the Twelve Dike River ports believe that the change to transport by steamship affects the livelihoods of sailing merchants, so they organized a petition group of about 300 people and arrived in Yangzhou on the Pujin steamer on the morning of the 13th to petition Wang, the Transport Envoy, at the Sian Public Office. They were received by Representative Ye Yucang. The purpose of their petition was divided into three points: (1) Maintain sailing transport, (2) There is currently no shortage of sales on each bank, so there is no need for steamship transport, (3) The current living is extremely difficult, please urge the merchants to handle the transport. Representative Ye agreed to forward the petition to the director and then summoned the entire group. Representative Ye reported that the director had adopted the three points of the petition, but needed to submit a written document for forwarding to the Ministry of Finance, and gave them good advice and explained in detail the director's mission to Yangzhou, which was to reorganize the transport and sales plan. The petition points are part of the plan. The group was satisfied and dispersed.</p>

<p>The Massacre on Dengbu Island: Dengbu Mountain in Dinghai is a remote island where pirates come and go. The residents are all vigilant. In the past, the local residents organized a security team to protect themselves. Later, it was disbanded due to an incident and has been suspended for many years. Since the province ordered all counties to organize voluntary security teams, the Dinghai County government added two graduates from the training class, Jin Zheng and Gao Renfeng, to the mountain to establish a security team. Jin was weak in nature, and everything was controlled by Gao. Therefore, most of the recruited team members were bandits. They often relied on armed force to harass the villagers. Last month, a man named Fang from Jintang, who was working as a sailor on a foreign ship, smuggled four pistols from abroad and entrusted his cousin to sell them on the mountain. District Chief Xu Shouqing heard about this and ordered Captain Ren of the team to detain Fang and take him to the Daxao Temple, where he poured boiling water on his head and crushed him with a stone mill. When Fang was being tortured, an old woman surnamed Mou was chanting Buddha's name and witnessed the pitiful situation. She knelt on the ground and begged for mercy. Unexpectedly, the captain held a rattan stick, slammed it on the table, and scolded loudly. The old woman was frightened and became insane. She drowned herself in the river a few days later. Afterwards, all the residents of the mountain were indignant and jointly filed a lawsuit with the county with forty or fifty villagers. However, Ren had bad intentions. On the evening of the Dragon Boat Festival, he led Shang and others to Maoji Grocery Store with guns, shooting and killing the manager of the store, Hua Rong'an, and Hua Ade, one after another. Ren's heart was still not satisfied, and he searched through various homes. Four people were shot and injured for no reason, and eight were shot and killed. This is truly a terrible thing to hear.</p>
<p>Bandits Intimidate and Extort Unsuccessfully, Killing Two Children: The family of Chuan Yinsheng, a resident in front of the Gulou in Zhenhai, has more than 100 mu of good land and more than 10,000 yuan in cash, which has aroused the covetousness of bandits. On the 5th of this month, he received a threatening letter demanding 10,000 silver dollars, limited to an immediate response, otherwise, they would take extraordinary measures, and so on. Chuan had no choice but to negotiate for 100 yuan, but the bandits wanted at least 1,000 yuan. To avoid disaster, Chuan fled to Shanghai. However, at 12:00 PM that day, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came with guns and rushed in, searching everywhere for Chuan. They could not find him and took Chuan's two children, aged ten and six, out, intending to execute them. Seeing that the situation was not good, Chuan's wife begged repeatedly, willing to obey the order in full, but the bandits still did not listen and shot and killed the two children, fleeing towards the Xijiao Field.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3 id="e142">Letter from the Lingbi County Government <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>To the Editors of Shenbao:</p>
<p>I recently read your special dispatch from Xuzhou in the issue of the 9th of this month, which contained a report about bandits from Lingbi robbing wheat from Xiao County. It said that the magistrate of Xiao County telegraphed the Anhui and Jiangsu provincial governments, stating that hundreds of bandits from Lingbi, armed with more than 200 guns, robbed hundreds of mu of wheat from the tenth district of Xiao County along the lake, and killed two civilians and injured five. Recently, they have even carried mortars and machine guns and carried out massacres, and so on. This is not true. The dispute between Lingbi and Xiao counties over the Qingzhong Lake fields has been going on for years. Every harvest season, the people of Xiao County crossed the border to forcibly cut and seize the wheat, resulting in armed fighting. In order to permanently resolve the dispute, a fundamental solution was proposed: abolish the fields and return them to the lake, and a telegram was sent to the Department of Civil Affairs of the provincial government to seek a proper solution. However, the people of Xiao County relied on force to carry out the invasion of the forbidden area. The people of Xiao County also did not comply with the orders and secretly planted every year, not only harvesting the wheat in the lake, but also further seizing the civilian fields in Lingbi County. In order to prevent this from happening, we repeatedly telegraphed the provincial governments of Anhui and Jiangsu and the Xiao County government to strictly prohibit it. We also sent training officers with teams to suppress and restrain the residents during the wheat season to prevent them from acting rashly. These were all on record. However, Wang Yirui and other civilians from Xiao County gathered more than 200 members of the Red Spear Society on the night of the 3rd of this month and secretly attacked the stationed police team at the Dawang Temple in Lingbi County, which is several miles away from the border of Xiao County. Although they broke through the encirclement, one soldier was still injured, and three rifles and one box gun were robbed, and many carts, cattle, and horses were looted from the Dawang Temple and other places. This was so rampant that it was almost like bandits. We telegraphed the provincial governments of Anhui and Jiangsu and the Xiao County government to strictly prohibit it in order to avoid expansion. According to subsequent reports, the people of Xiao County have increased their forces and launched a major attack, as if facing a major enemy. The situation is extremely precarious. We are now restraining our subordinates to avoid another major tragedy. This situation is obviously inconsistent with what was reported in your newspaper. We are hereby detailing the facts from beginning to end and requesting your newspaper to correct them in order to show credibility and maintain justice. This is our sincere prayer. Sincerely, Lingbi County Government, Anhui Province, June 11th.</p>

<p>Faculty and Staff Pass Resolution Rejecting Ministry of Education Document</p>
<p>Student Representatives to Petition in Beijing Today</p>
<p>Since the National Labor University was ordered to close by the Ministry, all faculty, staff, and students of the school have successively organized a school preservation committee and actively worked to preserve the school, as reported in previous newspapers. It has now been learned that the school's faculty and staff school preservation committee convened an executive committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, with Han Yanmen elected as chairman and Kang Xuan Yi as recorder. Many important cases were resolved, and a resolution rejecting the Ministry of Education document and a declaration to the outside world were passed, to be drafted and issued immediately. It is also heard that the school's graduating students have also formed a tight organization to support their alma mater. Since the school's students organized the student school preservation committee, their work has been extremely tense. At the third meeting yesterday, it was decided to issue a declaration and send representatives Gao Zongyi and Chen Beinong to Beijing to petition, scheduled to invite newspaper reporters to report on the destruction of labor education. It is heard that the school's student representatives are scheduled to depart today. If the petition fails to achieve the purpose of the Labor University's existence, there will be further action.</p>

<p>Since Jinan University reluctantly opened on Hart Road on March 15th of this year, the entire faculty and staff held two gatherings on April 5th and early May. Both times, the Ministry of Education only issued 40-50% of their salaries, ignoring the full salaries owed for the previous three months. The matter was raised at both gatherings for discussion on actively seeking legal recourse. At the time, it was felt that the timing was not right and no action was taken. It is now heard that the entire faculty and staff of the school, due to extremely difficult living conditions, have decided to hold a special meeting in the First Academy at 4:00 PM today to discuss solutions. It is also heard that Principal Zheng of the school sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education on the 13th, reporting the situation and requesting the immediate disbursement of back pay to avoid accidents.</p>

<p>The Scholar Who Doesn't Weed His Garden</p>
<p>Twenty-Six</p>
<p>I want to live in the vastness of the sea and sky, which means receiving education in the vastness of the sea and sky. Surely everyone will be happy and get what they want. What more could one ask for? I thought I had obtained Mr. Zhu's magic weapon, but I never expected him to say that I only knew half of it. I had to ask further, "Please tell me, what is the other half?" Mr. Zhu said, "There are three realms of life, and there are three realms of education. What you have proposed is the first realm." How free and happy are the whales in the sea, the cranes in the sky, and the lions in the forest! It is the same happiness when life attains freedom. When education reaches this realm, the classroom becomes paradise, and the children become living deities. But it is clearly a bird in the sky, and someone insists on catching it and putting it in a cage. It is clearly a fish in the sea, and someone insists on catching it and putting it in a bowl. It is clearly a wild beast in the forest, and someone insists on catching it and putting it in a fence. If you were this unfortunate bird, if you were this unfortunate fish, if you were this unfortunate beast, what would you do?" "I don't want to go into the cage. I don't want to go into the bowl. I don't want to go into the fence." "He doesn't care whether you want to or not. He simply captures you and puts you in there, what would you do?" "I will use the power of my small life, I will unite the power of all small lives and fight this person. I will peck through the birdcage, break through the fishbowl, bite through the fence, and flee to the vastness of the sea and sky!" "Or, for example, you are a free lion sleeping in the forest, and suddenly a tiger comes to invade you, what should you do?" "I will fight the tiger to the death!" Mr. Zhu said, "Good, when life encounters an enemy, it must rise up and fight. This is the second realm." I said, "Right! I want freedom! I want to fight!" Mr. Zhu said, "Look at a seed! It is pressed in the soil when it is cold and frozen. You say it is not free when it is pressed by the soil, so you remove the soil. You say it is not free when it is wrapped in the shell, so you peel off the shell. Good, a naked seed is exposed on free land, a hungry bird flies from a dead branch, and swallows it whole! Zhong'er, if this seed wants to sprout, grow, bloom, and bear fruit, you must let it spend some time hidden in the shell, lurking in the ground, slowly absorbing moisture, fertilizer, air, and sunlight to develop its life. This is the third realm."</p>
<p>I was overjoyed and smiled at Mr. Zhu and said, "Sir, you have miscalculated. What I knew was one-third, not half."</p>

<p>Four Amazing World Records Created</p>
<p>100 Meters, 200 Meters, 110-Meter Hurdles, 220-Yard Low Hurdles</p>
<p>The Tenth Games' Track and Field Championship Belongs to America</p>
<p>The breaking of world records in American track and field has become a daily occurrence. In the past few weeks, George Sipeige, Jim Vance, and Peng Yisimeng have made great contributions in the track and field world, and now Michael F. George Seling, Jackie Shenlei, etc. have successively made great contributions in the track and field world. Previous world records have become past tense, and there is no doubt that future surpassing achievements will continue to come. In short, the heartstrings of American track and field athletes have been stirred by the upcoming opening of the Tenth World Games and have completely entered a state of frenzy. From this point of view, it is difficult for other countries to compete with the United States for the track and field championships in the Tenth Games. If the United States fails to win, it would be an abnormal event in the history of world sports.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Four New Records <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The American Olympic trials were held in Cleveland on the 12th, creating four new world records. The black athlete Michael F. broke two world records in the 100 meters and 200 meters, with a time of 10.2 seconds in the 100 meters and 20.5 seconds (20 1/2 seconds) in the 200 meters. George Seling's 110-yard hurdles time was 14.1 seconds, shortening the old record by 3/10ths of a second. University of West Xia athlete Jack Gilai's 220-yard low hurdles time was 22.7 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="e157">100 Meters, 200 Meters <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Michael F.'s creation of two new worlds in one day is unprecedented, and the astonishing nature of his achievements can be described as unparalleled in history. His 100-meter time of 10.2 seconds is 1/5th of a second faster than the old record. The old record was set by American sprint pioneer Pat Ducques in April 23rd, 1921. The 200-meter record of 20.5 seconds is also 1/10th of a second faster than the old record. Rocks' world record set on May 1st, 1926 has now been surpassed by Michael F. However, Michael F.'s start was not perfect, but his finishing skills were excellent, like a storm's speed, and he was able to achieve great success. Michael F. has been very enthusiastic about sports from elementary school to university, and his body is very strong, with a height of 5 feet 11 inches and a weight of 180 pounds, which is rare among athletes.</p>
<h3 id="e158">110-Yard Hurdles <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>George Seling's hurdles are also very impressive. He broke the old record by 3/10ths of a second. This old record was produced as early as 12 years ago, created by Canada's Thompson on May 29th, 1920. Seling is 22 years old this year, 6 feet 1.5 inches tall, and weighs 155 pounds. He is a new hero. In the 70-yard race in the Ten Giants Games, anyone was more than 10 yards behind him. His 220-yard low hurdles also have an excellent record of 20.4 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="e159">220-Yard Low Hurdles <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Jack Gilai's 220-yard low hurdles shortened the old record by 3/10ths of a second. Bruggan's record set on May 17th, 1924 was 23 seconds. Jack is a student at the University of West Xia and has participated in all-American university competitions and is the hurdles champion of the Western Games. His 50-yard hurdles time is 6.2 seconds.</p>

<p>Advising Chen to Return to Work and Beijing Soon</p>
<p>Sun Ke Has a Minor Ailment, Appointment Rescheduled</p>
<p>Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen, arrived in Shanghai the night before last. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, he personally visited Minister of Transportation Chen Mingshu, urging him to dismiss his intention to resign and return to Beijing to resume his duties. Chen's attitude was slightly moved. At 4:30 PM in the afternoon, Lin drove to visit Sun Ke, but due to Sun's minor illness, they did not meet and rescheduled for another day. The details of the situation and Lin's remarks are recorded below:</p>
<p>Persuading Chen to Stay 　Chairman Lin drove out as early as 7:00 AM yesterday morning, arriving at 75 Shanzhong Road at 8:00 AM to visit Minister of Transportation Chen Mingshu, urging him to immediately dismiss his resignation intentions and encouraging him to take on difficult tasks. It is reported that Chen's attitude has softened somewhat due to Chairman Lin's sincere persuasion. If he can take some time to rest fully, he can return to Beijing to resume his duties. After talking for about an hour, Lin resigned and left, and then went to the Sincere Company to select and purchase goods.</p>
<p>Chen and Cai Visit Lin 　Minister of Transportation Chen Mingshu, accompanied by Cai Tingkai, commander of the 19th Route Army, went to Lin's private residence on Jin Shenfu Road at about 2:00 PM to pay their respects. Lin extended his utmost regards to Commander Cai.</p>
<p>Lin's Remarks 　Lin returned to his residence at 12:30 PM, and reporters from various newspapers visited him at this time. He was graciously received and made the following remarks: (Reporter asked) Chairman, you visited Minister Chen today. Has Minister Chen's intention to resign been dismissed? (Answer) Minister Chen's intention to resign can now be dismissed, but because he is too tired, he still needs to rest in Shanghai for a while. However, the date when he can go to Beijing to take up his duties is still uncertain. (Question) Has the Chairman met Minister Song? (Answer) I have not met him yet. I plan to visit and express my regards. (Question) What are the Chairman's views on the issue of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia? (Answer) This matter is currently under study and consideration by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a complete plan is being formulated. (Question) Does the Chairman have any opinions on suppressing the communists? (Answer) Currently, not only are the communist bandits rampant, but the bandits are also spreading, so it is urgent to find ways to eliminate them, to stabilize the region and ensure the livelihood of the people. The responsibility should be handled by the military committee to thoroughly suppress them, in order to achieve a permanent solution. (Question) The entire committee of Jiangsu Province recently submitted a general resignation. What does the Chairman think? (Answer) Because I passed through Beijing in a hurry, I have not seen a detailed report. I only saw a general outline in yesterday's newspaper, so I am not yet able to express an opinion. (Question) What is the latest situation in Guangdong? (Answer) It is not as serious as reported. I believe that with Mr. Hu Zhantang mediating, it should not escalate. (Question) When will the Chairman return to Beijing? (Answer) If it rains, I will stay a few more days.</p>
<p>Visit to Sun Did Not Materialize 　Chairman Lin went to visit Sun Ke at Moliai Road at 4:30 PM in the afternoon. He was received by Sun's secretary, Qu Dingxin. Chairman Lin entered the reception room, and Qu reported that Sun had suddenly caught a cold after dinner last night, with dizziness. He was treated by a German doctor in the afternoon and has gradually recovered. After notification, Mr. Sun originally intended to meet with Lin. Chairman Lin, fearing that Sun would be overworked, arranged to meet again another day, and then resigned from Sun's residence and returned to his own.</p>

<p>Going to Paris for Summer Vacation</p>
<p>Staying for About Two or Three Months</p>
<p>Former Foreign Minister Chen Youren has been staying in Shanghai, not asking about politics. Now that summer is approaching, he originally planned to go north to escape the heat, but due to various inconveniences, he decided to go abroad directly to Paris for a summer vacation. Yesterday morning at 2:00 AM, Chen, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Zhang Liying, boarded the French postal ship "Ittepon" and left Shanghai for France. Dozens of Chen's relatives and friends went to the port to see him off. Sun Ke did not go due to illness. According to Chen's entourage, Chen's trip to France is purely a private trip. After about two or three months, when the political situation is stable, he may return to the country.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Guo Taiqi's Remarks <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Saito Cabinet in Japan, its aggression against China has become more urgent. In addition to secretly consulting with the United Kingdom and the United States several times to convene a round table conference and seizing customs duties in the Northeast, it also tends to immediately recognize the puppet state of Manchuria. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency specially visited Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi yesterday to inquire about everything. Guo's remarks are as follows:</p>
<p>Recognizing the Puppet State 　(Reporter asked) If Japan recognizes the puppet state, which violates the Nine-Power Treaty, will the Ministry of Foreign Affairs make a statement? (Guo replied) This not only violates the Nine-Power Treaty, but also all of Japan's current aggressive acts in Manchuria are not allowed by the Nine-Power Treaty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will naturally make a corresponding attitude statement on this.</p>
<p>Round Table Conference 　(Question) Japan has secretly contacted the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy in Tokyo several times to convene a round table conference. Will the countries not invite us to participate and hold the meeting hastily? (Answer) The round table conference cannot be held without China's participation. It must be known that the convocation of the round table conference was proposed by Peng Ge, Chairman of the League of Nations General Assembly, so its progress must be based on the resolution of the League of Nations. Japan's various foreign propaganda are only for domestic purposes. Japan's dispatch of troops to Shanghai was unjustified, and the result was nothing, with a large number of casualties and the loss of international credibility. Therefore, it had to use the round table conference as a cover.</p>
<p>Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Russia 　(Question) The Northeast customs duties have been withheld.</p>
<p>How will the government deal with it? (Answer) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has protested to the Japanese side, and at the same time, it has contacted the British side. As for the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Russia has always had this hope. This should not be a problem. It is rumored that after the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Chen Youren will be sent to Russia as an envoy. I am completely unaware of this. I (Guo himself) am unwilling to express my opinion on the advantages and disadvantages of restoring diplomatic relations. This matter is being carefully considered by the central government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs beforehand. The date of my trip to England is undecided.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Li Fusun Clarifies Rumors <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Denying Signing the Free City Plan</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the Japanese advocated making Shanghai a free city, involving banker Li Fusun. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency specially visited Mr. Li. According to his statement, Mr. Li said that in April, the Pacific Daily News reported that the banking community had signed a plan for a free city in Shanghai. At that time, when asked by reporters, he issued a statement, which was published in various newspapers on April 15, stating "A free city sacrifices sovereignty, and anyone with a conscience will be deeply saddened." Later, a friend told him that the Japanese newspaper had fabricated a rumor that he had supported the free city, hoping to confuse international opinion. He did not believe that discerning people would believe it, and he had solemnly denied it, so he ignored it. As for the recent rumors in small newspapers, they may have come from Japanese newspapers. Whether he loves his country, although he cannot cut open his heart to show the people of the country, but based on his usual principles and actions, as well as his participation in various affairs after the Shanghai Incident, he believes that he will be recognized by patriotic compatriots. Regardless of the intention of seeking perfection, it will not harm him. He is sincerely afraid that</p>
<p>Those who truly advocate for a free city will use these unfounded records as an excuse, which is a hundred times more related than slandering him personally. This is what he deeply fears. He is busy with affairs, and it is difficult to refute these rumors one by one, whether in the past or in the future. He is grateful for the visit and will sincerely inform.</p>

<p>Sentries Come and Go</p>
<p>Monument to Fallen Loyal Souls Suddenly Dismantled</p>
<p>Japanese Army Negotiates with Fifth District Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Along the railway on Dongbaoxing Road and Qiujiang Road in Zhabei, there have always been Japanese naval marine corps stationed. Those who go to the war zone to pay their respects often see them. Yesterday morning, the traces of Japanese naval sentry posts suddenly disappeared in the Dongbinxing Road area. The residents thought that the Japanese army had withdrawn automatically. However, at noon, several Japanese soldiers negotiated with the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, saying that the monument to the fallen loyal souls of the Japanese army erected near the Indian Church on Dongbaoxing Road had been removed. The bureau officer explained it to them, and then it was all right. However, from the afternoon onwards, Japanese troops were seen stationed again along the railway on Dongbaoxing Road and Qiujiang Road.</p>

<p>According to news from the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Delegation, Representative Gu Shaochuan is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Beijing on the 15th, stay in Shanghai for one day on the 16th, and then return to Beijing to go to Peiping.

<p>Wu Huanzhang, representative of Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday morning, he went to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association in this port and discussed ways to support Ma with Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, and other executive directors of the association, and reported on the recent anti-Japanese situation of the Ma army. It is reported that Wu is the Director and Secretary-General of the Party Affairs Guidance Committee of Heilongjiang Province.</p>

<p>The National Crisis Rescue Team was initiated and organized by the Management Committee of the National Crisis Relief Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition hosted by He Xiangning. Mr. He and Mr. Liu Yazi presided over the matter. The 14 team members all worked on the front lines of Shanghai, responsible for rescue work. The night before last, they prepared a large number of medicines and took a car to Peiping, and then went to Guandong to rescue the wounded. It is also reported that 7 or 8 people from Peiping will join the team. Since the September 18th Incident, the volunteer army outside Guandong has not hesitated to sacrifice, and has continued to resist the violent Japanese army with meager strength, falling forward and rising again, never giving up, which is truly rare and unique. According to the vast land and large population of the Northeast, the value of its war is more important than the Battle of Shanghai, and the roads are dangerous and the supply is difficult. The wounded soldiers are often abandoned in the wilderness, and no one rescues them. Their suffering is a hundred times greater than that of the soldiers fighting in Shanghai. The departure of the National Crisis Rescue Team this time will surely be able to overcome dangers and reach its destination, achieving effective rescue results.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong and other areas were devastated after the Shanghai Incident, the Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee of the disaster area in this city specially submitted a request to the National Government yesterday for the purpose of maintaining the revival of industrial and commercial enterprises in the disaster area, requesting that all donations and taxes in the disaster area be exempted. (The original submission has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper) They also sent a request for opinions on the revival to various trade associations and groups. The original text is recorded below: We hereby respectfully inform you that since the Japanese invaders invaded Shanghai on January 28, all industrial and commercial enterprises in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places have been destroyed, and it is imperative to plan for revival. Therefore, people from all industries in the disaster area have elected members to organize this association to seek the revival of industry and commerce in the disaster area. In order to gather wisdom and expand benefits, the first committee meeting resolved to solicit revival opinions from various commercial groups, etc. Accordingly, a letter is hereby sent to inform you, and we hope that your association will not hesitate to teach us and instruct us.

<h3 id="e171">Japanese Army Begins to Withdraw from Shajing Port <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Far East News Agency reported that the Japanese army in the Shajing Port area of ​​eastern Shanghai violated the agreement and stayed without withdrawing. Mr. Yu Hongjun, a member of our side of the Joint Committee, repeatedly urged them, but they repeatedly delayed on the grounds of various reasons. The other day, at a meeting of the Joint Committee, Mr. Yu once again directly asked Mr. Okazaki, the Japanese representative, about the exact date of the withdrawal. He only said that it was in preparation and could be implemented within three to five days. Afterwards, Yu formally sent a letter to urge them strictly. It is now learned that the Japanese army west of the Hujiamu Bridge to the Shajing Port area has begun to withdraw, and the posts have also been canceled. Only patrol teams come and go from time to time. However, our side was not notified in advance. The Municipal Public Security Bureau believed that there were many traitors in that area, so it specially sent a police squadron there yesterday to maintain order. Because the Japanese army still arbitrarily enters the country, it is easy to cause misunderstandings, and our side will file a negotiation.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the ceasefire agreement and the implementation of the withdrawal of the Japanese army, all the Japanese marine corps stationed in various Japanese cotton mills and factories in western Shanghai have also been withdrawn one after another. Only a small number of sailors were left in the factories and did not go out. It is now learned that various Japanese factories are now secretly increasing the number of sailors stationed in the factories, because rumors have been spreading outside recently. According to an investigation yesterday, there are about 140 Japanese marine corps in the Fan Shi Wataru Toyota Cotton Mill, 150 in the Xiaoshadu Inner and Outer Cotton Mills, and 120 in the Rihua Cotton Mill. The hemp bag factory, silk factory, Kiwa Cotton Mill, etc. each have about 100 people. The soldiers who were added were secretly transported by trucks, and military uniforms and weapons were loaded in freight cars separately, covered with white cloth to avoid attracting attention. However, the workers in each factory were panicked when they saw that heavy troops had been added, and rumors spread, which was actually detrimental to public security.</p>

<p>Tokyo, Fourteenth, Far East News Agency: Japanese merchants in Shanghai have suffered significant losses due to the impact of the Shanghai War. For the sake of future maintenance, they have requested special relief funds from the Japanese government. The other day, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance, Riri, the Director of Accounting, Fujii, the Director of Finance, Tomita, and the Director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tani, gathered to discuss the matter. As a result, it was decided to allocate 6.5 million yuan from the Fund for Cultural Undertakings in China and the profit from the Mint to provide relief. However, it is heard that the amount requested by the Japanese residents in Shanghai is 13 million yuan.</p>

<p>Chen Jiliang, Deputy Minister of Naval Affairs and Commander of the 1st Fleet, has recently resigned due to his weak constitution. A month ago, communist bandits repeatedly captured Zhanglong, and he had to go to Xiamen to direct the suppression of the Red Army. Now that the communist bandits in Zhangzhou have withdrawn and the 19th Route Army has also opened up Fujian one after another, he believes that there are already ways to suppress the Red Army in Fujian. He plans to take this opportunity to recuperate. It is heard that he sent a telegram to Beijing yesterday to resign from his position as Deputy Minister of the Naval Affairs Department and Commander of the 1st Fleet.</p>

<p>Not Asking About Politics, Devoting Himself to Industry</p>
<p>Former Minister of the Navy Yang Shuzhuang returned to Shanghai from Beijing the other day. A reporter from the Daily News visited Mr. Yang at his private residence yesterday to ask about his feelings about his trip to the north and his views on the current situation. Mr. Yang said that China has been plagued by internal strife for the past 20 years, and banditry has spread. The root cause is the social and economic poverty and the hardship of life. Therefore, the fundamental way to save the country is to start with revitalizing industry. After he recovers from his illness, he will go to Henan to investigate coal mines, and personally go to Zhangde Shuiye Town and Keyin County Hebi Town to inspect the ore seedlings produced there, which are very rich. Former Governor of Henan Province Zhang Fengtai once proposed to purchase and establish Yi'an and Jiuhua companies to engage in purchasing, but due to improper management and inconvenient transportation, they failed to develop. He now plans to raise capital to organize China An General Company to extract bituminous coal using scientific methods, and build light railways from Shuiye and Hebi towns to Weihe River, and then from Weihe River to distribute it to Tianjin and Shanghai. The coal quality is good and the price is low, so the sales will definitely be developed in the future, which can recover some of the rights and interests. He is now not asking about politics and can devote himself to industry, or he can be of some benefit to the country and society.</p>

<p>The Taikoo Company's Shengjing ship hit a reef at Qingming Island in Weihaiwei, and the passengers were rescued, as recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Following are the additional details from yesterday:</p>
<p>Shengjing Set into Reef Stone 　The Shengjing ship encountered fog and hit a reef. The bow of the ship hit into the reef stone, and two large holes have been formed. The reef stone is set inside the bow of the ship, and the seawater entering the bow cabin has reached 11 and a half feet. The ship's body has become a symbol of front sinking and rear rising, and it cannot reverse. Except when the tide rises and floats the ship, it is impossible to get it out.</p>
<p>Cargo Has Been Unloaded First 　The ship is loaded with 3,000 to 4,000 pieces of cargo, and there are also many head foreign cloth pieces. Those loaded in the head cabin have been completely immersed in the water. The middle and rear cabins have not been affected. Each passenger family went to inquire, and the company has decided to clear all the cargo. The Fengtian ship has been dispatched from Tanggu and is currently unloading. It is to be expected that after the cargo is unloaded, the ship will be lighter and easier to float.</p>
<p>Engineers Go to Inspect 　The cost and layout of the ship must be worth one million yuan. The Shanghai branch decided on a rescue plan yesterday, and planned to first find a way to get the reef stone that was set in to escape, and then use water boards and wooden boards for temporary repairs, but the procedure was tedious. Therefore, the Shanghai branch invited two engineers from the Jiangnan Shipyard, and the Shanghai branch appointed staff and applied equipment, etc., and released the Ningbo ship yesterday morning to sail to Qingming Island to try to salvage and rescue it.</p>
<p>Japanese Salvage Ship Has Arrived 　After the accident on the Shengjing, the bank telegraphed the Japanese Salvage Company to send a ship to rescue it. The Japanese Salvage Ship Company dispatched a salvage work ship near Dalian Bay, which arrived yesterday. Divers are now being sent into the seabed to inspect the situation of the grounding reef. However, according to news from the bank yesterday, the Shengjing ship is expected to be rescued no matter what, but the weather was still good yesterday morning, which was conducive to work, but there were winds and waves in the afternoon, which hindered the salvage work.</p>
<p>All Passengers Escaped Safely 　A total of 350 passengers and crew members on board, after the British destroyer Warren and the naval tugboat went to rescue them, the company continued to receive a telegram yesterday afternoon that all the crew members and passengers on board had been completely rescued and sent to Weihaiwei by 9:00 AM on the 14th. Captain Li Dexu is still on board, directing rescue and other affairs.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Warships Protect 　In addition to sending two destroyers to assist in the rescue, the British Navy on Liugong Island dispatched three or four more destroyers to Qingming Island yesterday, anchoring on the left and right of the Shengjing ship to prevent pirates from looting.</p>

<p>Japan has designated Shanghai as a plague-stricken port, and passengers going east from this port have already implemented stool examinations. However, among the passengers disembarking from the Dalian Steamship Company's Tianjin Maru, which came to Shanghai from Tianjin, there were also people suffering from the plague. When the ship arrived in Qingdao, it was banned from entry by the local customs and the ship was moved outside the port. Disinfection was carried out inside the ship, and the infected passengers were sent to the plague hospital for isolation. The date of the Tianjin Maru's arrival in Shanghai was therefore delayed by two days.</p>

<p>Thoroughly Oppose Opium Monopoly</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, in view of the unstable attitude of the central government towards the prohibition of smoking, has been repeatedly recorded in various newspapers recently. The authorities have taken the news of the opium monopoly policy. Yesterday, it telegraphed to the National Anti-Drug Inspection Groups to pay special attention and prepare anti-drug forces to deal with it. The telegram is recorded as follows: The National Anti-Drug Association, the Anti-Drug Fengchuan Association, and the Anti-Drug Groups of Various Groups and People are all aware. The voice of the opium monopoly has been rising.</p>
<p>Shi Fu, the whole country is in chaos. According to the Shanghai Japanese-language Daily News</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>According to the news, the central government has been unable to do anything due to the lack of financial resources, and has decided to implement the opium monopoly system. The evening news in Shanghai every evening and the morning news in Shanghai yesterday also published the same news. After reading it, I was shocked. In addition to doing my best to fight to the death, this association also asks you to pay close attention and prepare sufficient anti-drug forces to prevent any eventuality. The 22 articles on the anti-smoking proposal recently proposed by this association are still requested to be unanimously approved and requested by the government to approve and implement them in order to promote a perfect smoking ban. This is the proposal of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Business Community Opposes Opium Monopoly <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Declaration by the Nine-Road Business Federation on Aiwunyi Road</p>
<p>The Nine-Road Business Federation on Aiwunyi Road issued a declaration yesterday, saying that the opium monopoly cannot be implemented in our country, and the national government entrusted by public opinion has no room to argue. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has been leading the masses for years, vowing to fight to the death. Who dares to advocate inappropriateness, let alone the merits and demerits. However, the anti-smoking authorities have generously entered their new inquiries and gradually banned it. The financial authorities also regard it as a benefit and open up the source. The central government is still mindful of the people, and the provinces have first taken the lead. The special taxes and donations of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Fujian, and the disguised monopolies of Jire, Sui, and Chahar, still say that this is the local government's way to go against the decree, and they have lost their provincial status. At first, the central government's award of desire was unclear, deaf and dumb, and it has started the boiling resentment of our people. However, recently, various newspapers have been spreading rumors that the central government has resolutely implemented the monopoly with financial support. If so, have the officials of the central authorities ever considered the reasons for the failure of the past trial of the monopoly? I don't know where to put the Premier's legacy of public opinion and discussion. The opium monopoly cannot be implemented in our country: (1) It makes the international community laugh, (2) It contradicts the Three People's Principles, (3) It betrays party discipline, (4) It violates public opinion. The Premier's legacy is clear, and public opinion is as solid as a rock. I hope that the central authorities will wake up from their dreams and add awareness. Otherwise, the public opinion will not hesitate to sacrifice and fight to the death. This is the declaration.</p>

<p>Telegram from the Jiangxi Association in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Association in Shanghai, concerning the opposition to the public monopoly of opium, sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan yesterday, addressed to the President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government: "According to reports in Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai yesterday, the central government will implement an opium public monopoly system, establishing offices in Nanjing and Shanghai, as well as various ports along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Yangtze River lines, extending to the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian. We are deeply suspicious and shocked. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has already telegraphed Your Excellency, requesting the announcement of a ban on opium. Our association also believes that in this extraordinary period of widespread discussion and the advancement of fallacious theories, the central government should make a clear statement regarding the overall opium prohibition. Not only should efforts be made to prevent the aforementioned measures, but also the thirteen provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Hebei, and Suiyuan, where de facto public monopolies have already been implemented, should be clearly punished and ordered to abolish them, so as to preserve the dignity of the law and the authority of the central government. We await your reply with the utmost anticipation." Respectfully submitted by the Jiangxi Association in Shanghai, with humble greetings.</p>

<p>The strike of workers at the concession telephone company entered its eighth day yesterday. The strike committee submitted a protest letter to the company, demanding a response within twenty-four hours. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Submitting the Protest: At 2:00 PM yesterday, representatives Chen Yaozu, Xu Shize, Ye Yilong, and others, along with representatives from various departments, went to the New Central Bank on Fujian Road to submit a protest letter to the company. They were received by engineer Wilson. The representatives stated that the company had repeatedly and unjustifiably rejected the workers' demands, leading to the strike and disrupting public utilities, for which the company should be held responsible. Furthermore, the company's notice slandered all employees and dismissed twelve workers from the northern branch. This extreme oppression of workers could lead to unforeseen consequences in the future. The strike committee, representing over three thousand employees, issued a serious warning to the company, demanding a written response within twenty-four hours of the protest letter's arrival. The company has agreed to respond today.</p>
<p>Strike Committee Announcement: The Youth Workers' Department of the strike committee announced yesterday: "The strike is now at a critical stage. All our young workers must resolutely fight. Each department should convene a meeting of young workers tonight to (1) discuss the organization of youth worker pickets and propaganda teams, (2) discuss the unique suffering and demands of youth workers, and (3) each department must send one representative to a meeting at 11:00 AM on the 15th to discuss these issues."</p>
<p>Strike Tribunal: In order to deal with those who violate strike discipline, the strike committee established a strike tribunal yesterday, appointing a chief judge to be designated by the strike committee's presidium, and seven judges, one each from the Fujian Road, Min'er Road, Jiangxi Road, Metterhurst Road, and Haining Road branches, as well as the picket department and the youth workers' department. Strike regulations have also been promulgated.</p>

<p>Various Groups Form Fire Insurance Research Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, regarding the issue of fire insurance compensation in the disaster areas after the January 28th Incident, sent letters to the Chinese Insurance Association, the Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Promotion Association, the Lawyers' Association, and the Accountants' Association, stating: "Since the January 28th Incident occurred in this city, the disaster in the Zhabei area and its vicinity has been extremely severe, with countless losses. The responsibility for fire insurance compensation has become a major issue. This chamber has repeatedly received requests from various parties to invite both insurance industry and policyholder representatives to negotiate reasonable relief measures. On the 11th of this month, we convened representatives from the Shanghai Chinese Insurance Association and the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Promotion Association to exchange views. At that time, both parties agreed that the matter was of great importance, and that the process should begin with research, followed by further solutions based on the circumstances. It was unanimously agreed that the City Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Insurance Association, the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Promotion Association, and the Lawyers' Association should each select two representatives, and the Accountants' Association should select one representative (nine in total) to jointly form the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Research Association to handle the matter. The City Chamber of Commerce was designated as the convener. We are recording this and sending separate letters to request the appointment of representatives. We hope that your association will take note and promptly appoint representatives to participate in the organization of the research association, and that you will inform this chamber of the names of the appointed representatives in advance so that we can send invitations when scheduling meetings. We eagerly await your response."</p>

<p>According to the Navigation Administration, the Hong Kong government previously restricted the entry of Chinese vessels captained by foreign captains because China had not joined the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. However, now that China has joined the convention and has been recognized by various countries, the Hong Kong government's restrictions have not been lifted. The Ministry of Communications has been actively negotiating with the Hong Kong government and is preparing to hold examinations for ship captains and crew in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan. All regulations have been drafted, and measures for foreign captains to obtain licenses have also been finalized and will be implemented soon.</p>

<p>Encouraging Tea Merchants to Develop Foreign Trade</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Foreign Tea Merchants Association yesterday, stating that the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau had forwarded a directive from the Ministry of Industry, Business Document No. 11493, informing them of a report submitted by the Consul General in Taipei in March regarding the state of Taiwanese tea in the past and this year. The original document was to be retained by the bureau for reference. "Since Taiwan became Japanese territory, its tea exports have increased annually, creating a strong rival for our country's tea industry. In addition to detailing the current situation for reference, the report also mentions that since the September 18th Incident, sales to Southeast Asia and Russia have decreased significantly, presenting a good opportunity for our country's tea industry to develop foreign trade. Therefore, we should encourage the industry to promote sales to benefit the country and its people. We are specially forwarding the report for your information and action." A copy of the report was enclosed. In accordance with this directive, we are forwarding the original report for your information and action.</p>

<p>The Red Swastika Society, recognizing the severity of the disaster in the Wusong district, where residents are displaced and rural relief is urgently needed, sent five members, including Zhao, to Wusong the day before yesterday with relief funds. They consulted with municipal commissioner Tang Chengzong on relief measures and conducted a survey of impoverished households in the villages. Seven areas, including the 22nd, 25th, 32nd, 26th, 39th, 40th, and 41st districts, totaling 600 households, were identified as the most severely affected. Relief tickets will be issued to each household, and the relief distribution will be held today at the old site of the Wusong Flour Mill on Sanyang Road. It is reported that in the third and thirty-third districts, the Wusong town area, homes have been almost completely destroyed, and only 30% of the residents have returned, making it difficult to conduct a survey at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e192">The Birth of Chinese Military Music <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Historically, Chinese music before the Three Dynasties, although divided into Shao music and Wu music, both belonged to the realm of civil virtue. Purely martial military music originated with the Dayu music of the Eastern Han Dynasty, reaching its peak in the Tang Dynasty, and gradually declining after the Song Dynasty. Although the late Qing Dynasty had types such as triumphant music and gong and drum music, they were not very developed. In the mid-Guangxu period, Western military music entered China, and its influence grew daily. Today, national and social institutions, as well as groups, all use Western music, which has a significant impact on national identity. Recently, there has been a growing call for traditional Chinese music, but it has remained within the cultural sphere. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has initiated a project to revive ancient military music, led by Zheng Jinwen of the Datong Music Society. A small team (60 people) will be formed first, with instruments divided into (wind), (string), (plucked), and (percussion) sections, totaling more than 30 types, manufactured using modern methods, with the standards being large volume, portability, and ease of carrying. The musical scores will be selected from appropriate ancient war songs. The team members will be composed of Boy Scouts from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and training will begin soon. It is also reported that the Datong Music Society's large orchestra will be recruiting 20 more musicians to expand its size. Those with basic musical knowledge can register at No. 36 Songshan Road at the society's office.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Unexpected Twist in Pudong Rent Reduction <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Since being approved by the Municipal Rent Reduction Movement Committee, the Pudong District Rent Reduction Movement Committee immediately petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Five District Party Headquarters to reduce rents. Upon receiving the petition, the Five District Party Headquarters went to the Pudong Chamber of Commerce to discuss rent reduction measures in order to find an appropriate solution. Yesterday (14th), the Pudong Rent Reduction Committee suddenly received a notice from the Third District Public Security Bureau, and dispatched a representative to the bureau. Section Chief Niu of the Third District Public Security Bureau expressed the following opinions to the representative: (1) Pudong is not a war zone and should not reduce rents; (2) Both the Rent Reduction Committee and the Tenants' Union are among the prohibited organizations; (3) Land prices in Shanghai have increased, so there is only reason to increase rents, not reduce them; (4) The committee must stop its work immediately; (5) The seals used should be confiscated, but to save face, the matter will not be pursued further. It is reported that the Rent Reduction Committee believes that the rent reduction movement is intended to relieve the suffering of the common people and involves no illegal activities, so they are extremely indignant that Section Chief Niu would make such statements. They have immediately submitted a report to the Party and government organs and the General Committee for instructions. They will continue their work until they receive orders from the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Five District Party Headquarters, and the Municipal Rent Reduction General Committee.</p>

The resolutions were: (1) In view of the general situation in Hongkou, rents for February, March, and April should be waived, and silver rents should be converted to silver dollars.

<p>Route 3 Restored to Original Condition</p>
<p>The Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company, in order to restore its operations, is striving to resume business. Route 1, which runs from the Jishan Road intersection directly to Jiangwan, is temporarily suspended due to the bombing of the Yokohama Road Bridge, which has not yet been repaired. Route 3, which runs from the Jishan Road intersection to Zhenru, resumed operations on June 1st and is running as usual. However, because the iron barriers at the Baoshan Road intersection were removed and the Qiujiang Road surface was not repaired, the company was granted permission by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to temporarily change the route, starting from the North Station Jielu, along Xinmin Road, Datong Road, and Jiaotong Road, directly to Zhenru. Now that the Public Concession has announced the lifting of martial law on the 13th, and the barbed wire at the Baoshan Road intersection has been removed on the same day, North Henan Road is now directly connected to Baoshan Road. Therefore, the company's Route 3 will also restore its previous route from the 14th, starting from the Baoshan Road intersection, along Qiujiang Road, Gonghe Xin Road, and Jiaotong Road, directly to Zhenru. The fare schedule remains the same. Station 2 was originally the South Seas Business Association, but because that station was too short, it was changed to Song Park Road. Station 10 was changed to Xiaochangmiao. The fare for the entire route remains the same.</p>

<p>Promoting the New System of Weights and Measures</p>
<p>The Public Concession will also implement it</p>
<p>The new system of weights and measures in this city, after being promoted by the Bureau of Social Affairs, has recently become increasingly effective. The Chinese area has been fully implemented, and the French Concession has also been implemented. The Public Concession has not yet been implemented. The Bureau of Social Affairs is planning to thoroughly promote the system of weights and measures. The situation of trial implementation of weights and measures in each district is recorded below:</p>
<p>Nanshi District: Nanshi District was the earliest district to implement weights and measures and has now fully implemented it and has been re-examined four or five times. However, some stores still use old-fashioned weights and measures due to habit, making it impossible to unify the new system. The Municipal Weights and Measures Verification Office is planning to conduct another re-examination.</p>
<p>Zhabei District: The promotion of the new system of weights and measures in Zhabei was also quite early, so now all stores and vegetable markets use the new system of weights and measures. After the Shanghai War, many residents still used old measures. A re-examination is also planned.</p>
<p>French Concession: The promotion of the new system of weights and measures in the French Concession, after several contacts with the French authorities by the Bureau of Social Affairs, has now been implemented. However, it has not been implemented for long, so it is not yet fully unified. The Bureau of Social Affairs plans to increase re-examination to promote the unification of weights and measures. The Public Concession has not yet implemented the new system. The Bureau of Social Affairs is in contact with the Concession authorities and it is expected to be implemented soon.</p>

<p>Southern Bandit Sentenced to Two Years</p>
<p>Yu Shengsan from Hunan and Li Zicai from Wuxi, for writing threatening letters from May 21st to the first of this month, and delivering them to Hu Yueshan, the local owner of the Jintai Electrical Factory at No. 210 Grant Road, Yangshupu, demanding 10,000 dollars, signed "Southeast Self-Defense Army's Rear Service Preparation Office," and arranging a meeting near the Xietu Road bridge in the French Concession, with violent language, were reported to the</p>
<p>Yangshupu Police Station. The police station dispatched Chinese detectives Shen Wanzhou, Shan Zhaoxian, and Guo Jingbang, along with Qian Wancai, the representative of Hu, to the agreed location. They first captured Yu, who confessed that Li Zicai was hiding at the Kaitai Hotel at No. 12 Beihai Road. The detectives went secretly and captured Li. They were taken to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, judge Qiao Wanxuan continued the interrogation in the first division. The police station's lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the Kaitai Hotel's cashier and tea server had brought the registration book for Li Zicai's room to the court, and the registered name was Li Zong, Li Zicai's alias. He requested an inquiry. According to Rong Jinbao, the cashier of the Kaitai Hotel, and Chen Wenbin, the tea server, Li Zhisui, Li Zhisui, had been living in the hotel for more than a month, and Yu Shengsan had also stayed there for two or three nights. They knew each other and played mahjong several times, but they did not know about the threatening letter. The registration book was presented to the court. The two defendants denied the charges, claiming that they were committed by a certain Jia who was at large, overturning their confession to the police station. Judge Qiao instructed the police station's lawyer Zhang and the defendants' attorney to begin the debate. Lawyer Zhang stated that the two defendants had fully admitted to the police station that they had jointly discussed and carried out the act, and the confession was clear and without coercion. Therefore, he requested the court to impose a severe sentence according to law. Judge Qiao then sentenced Yu Shengsan and Li Zicai to two years in prison each for the crime of joint extortion. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined will be credited at a rate of two days to one day of imprisonment. The threatening letter was confiscated.</p>

<p>Wireless Radio Stolen</p>
<p>Five Robbers Arrive Suddenly</p>
<p>Forcibly Remove Wireless Radio and Leave</p>
<p>After Investigation, All Five Robbers Arrested</p>
<p>At 2:45 PM yesterday, five robbers first went to the Feilong Car Company at No. 696 Edward Road and rented two cars. They drove to the residence of Li Jishen, an important figure in the National Government, on Luban Road in the French Concession, and stole a wireless radio worth over 7,000 taels. However, within two hours, the case was solved and all five robbers were arrested. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Young Man Rents Cars: At 2:40 PM yesterday afternoon, a young customer in Western clothes, speaking in a local accent and giving the name Zhang, suddenly arrived at the Feilong Car Company at No. 696 Xixin Bridge on Edward Road. He said he needed to rent two cars until 4:10 PM, stating that the rental fee was 8.60 dollars. The company's cashier then ordered car drivers Xu Bingwen (from Tongzhou) and He Acai (from Changzhou) to drive business car No. 18242 (city No. 4201) and black-plated car No. 8605.</p>
<p>Wireless Radio: After the price was agreed upon, four more people arrived, all dressed in long gowns. They talked to the young man briefly and then all boarded the cars together, driving directly to Luban Road and stopping at the entrance of Lane 163. The five men got out of the cars and walked into Building No. 3. The two drivers waited inside the cars. After about 45 minutes, the five men came out with a large wireless radio and loaded it into the cars. The five men then calmly boarded the cars again and ordered the drivers to drive to Avenue Joffre.</p>
<p>Identifying the Numbers: Building No. 3 is the residence of Li Jishen, an important figure in the National Government. A shortwave wireless radio was installed in the residence, allowing direct communication between Nanjing and Shanghai. Unexpectedly, all five men were robbers, and it is unknown how they suddenly had the idea of posing as police officers to rent cars and steal the radio. At the time, the people in Li's residence were initially unaware of what was happening. Considering that the location was in the Concession and they should have come with Chinese and Western detectives, and seeing that the five men were neither merchants nor students, they suspected their actions. They ordered a servant to chase to the entrance of the lane and identify the two car numbers, and immediately reported to the police station.</p>
<p>Tracking the Robbers: Upon receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched Chinese Chief Inspector Jin Jiulin, Chief Detective Li Yaolong, Deputy Detectives Zhang Zili and Qian Yuming, and detective Cui Guo, to search in all directions. They also went to the Car Affairs Office to check the two cars, and learned that they had both been rented from Feilong. They urgently went to Feilong to inquire about the situation. According to the drivers, when the cars arrived at Avenue Joffre, they unloaded the radio into a bungalow. The five men then boarded the cars again and drove straight to the New Eastern Hotel at the intersection of Xizang Road and Beihai Road. The young man then paid 8.80 dollars.</p>
<p>Five Criminals Arrested: Upon hearing this, the detectives first drove black-plated car No. 8605 to the police station for temporary detention. They then led all the detectives directly to the New Eastern Hotel to inquire about their appearance and clothing. They arrested six people in room 402 on the fourth floor. Except for one leatherworker who was not involved, the five were all criminals. The mastermind was named Li Zijie. They were all taken to the police station. After a thorough interrogation by the police chief, the location of the stolen goods was traced. They were ordered to be detained separately, awaiting transfer to the court for prosecution.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Disposal of Garbage Issues <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Various Methods Discussed</p>
<p>Chinese and Concession Authorities Cooperate</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, yesterday (the 13th), representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and the Engineering Departments of the two concessions, along with the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, met at the Public Works Department to discuss the problem of garbage dumping in the Whangpoo River. After a half-day meeting, various methods were decided upon, some of which will be implemented immediately, such as: (1) Due to the difficulty of supervision at night, garbage boats will be prohibited from operating at night in the future; (2) More supervisors will be stationed in the Whangpoo River to prevent garbage boats from dumping waste along the way; (3) A canal will be dug at the Longhua Mouth garbage storage area to allow garbage boats to enter and unload; (4) Police will be stationed at the garbage storage area to supervise; (5) Garbage boats must be covered to prevent odors from escaping and to prevent dumping along the way; (6) When loading garbage onto boats, it must first be weighed. The manager will fill out a ticket and give it to the boat owner, who will then present it to the manager at the storage area for re-weighing, so that the boat owner will not dare to dump along the way; (7) Boat owners who violate the regulations will be severely punished. The Chief Engineer of the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, Mr. Fessard, has estimated the cost of digging the canal near Longhua Mouth. According to Mr. Fessard, the total cost of the canal is not very high and is within the capabilities of the Shanghai Municipality. The plan is to dig a canal in the middle of the garbage storage area, 300 feet long, 80 feet wide, and 6 feet deep, with embankments on both sides so that covered garbage boats can dock and unload. It is said that during yesterday's meeting, the concession authorities raised the issue of the long-term suitability of the current garbage storage area, fearing that once a proper plan is implemented, the Chinese authorities might suddenly decide that Longhua Mouth is no longer suitable for garbage storage, resulting in wasted effort and expense. However, according to a certain gentleman from the Health Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Government is very willing to cooperate with the two concession authorities to ensure that the decisions made at yesterday's meeting are fully implemented. Representatives from the two concessions have already contacted the municipal government regarding a five-year lease agreement for the Longhua Mouth storage area. The municipal government is currently considering this matter and is expected to respond within a few days. It is noted that garbage from the northern and southern districts of Shanghai and the two concessions is currently contracted out to laborers who transport it daily to the open space at Longhua Mouth for villagers to purchase as fertilizer. However, the transport boats often seek convenience by dumping waste along the Whangpoo River, causing the waterways to become clogged and the water sources to become polluted. Although the authorities have repeatedly taken measures to stop this practice, they have been largely ineffective. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, this practice has become even more prevalent, with an estimated 1,000 tons of garbage being dumped into the Whangpoo River daily. Since the city's drinking water is sourced from the Whangpoo River, polluting the water sources can easily lead to epidemics, which is very harmful to public health. Since the Continental Daily proposed taking measures to stop this practice on the 27th of last month, the authorities have gradually paid more attention, leading to yesterday's meeting. However, while the garbage problem has seen some improvement, the issue of sewage discharge into the waterways, which is also a source of epidemics, also deserves attention from the authorities, so that it can be remedied.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Promoting National Goods While Privately Importing Inferior Goods <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhengfu's Despicable and Clever Scheme</p>
<p>Falsely Printing Trademarks of National Goods Factories</p>
<p>Many Inferior Goods and Fabrics Confiscated</p>
<p>Shop Employees Arrested, Gu Has Fled</p>
<p>Gu Zhengfu, a native of Pudong and owner of the Zhenkang Cloth Store at No. 13 Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, south of Old Garbage Bridge, specializes in privately selling Japanese goods. Since the beginning of the boycott of Japanese goods, Gu has not only failed to change his ways but has instead increased the quantity of his private sales during this time of national crisis. In addition to selling them privately on an ongoing basis, he stockpiles the remainder in foreign warehouses such as Baohe and Donglai along the northern bank of the Suzhou Creek, waiting for prices to rise. His method of reselling inferior goods is quite clever, which is why he has never been discovered. Gu usually uses the slogan of promoting national goods as a cover. While privately importing inferior goods, he still trades with the Meilun Weaving Factory and the Hongzhang Dyeing Factory, and then privately prints the trademarks of these two factories and pastes them onto the inferior goods and fabrics. After this disguise, and with a slight reduction in prices, people are fooled, blindly follow suit, and recognize these inferior goods as national goods. Now, the secret has been fully uncovered by the Meilun and Hongzhang factories. Considering that Gu's despicable behavior not only undermines the patriotic movement but also damages the reputation of the two factories, they reported the matter to the Old Gate Police Station at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, requesting a thorough investigation. Detective Tang Si, Su Changsheng, and Detective Liu Junqing, along with Western detectives, rushed to the Zhenkang Cloth Store to search. They found three large boxes of fabrics falsely labeled as national goods, each box containing about 30 to 40 bolts. Gu Zhengfu had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Gu Zhengda, also known as Gu Zhucheng, an employee of the store and a native of Pudong, was arrested. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Ge Shixun conducted the preliminary hearing. According to Hu Jiabao, the police station's lawyer, the defendant is being prosecuted under Article 268 of the Criminal Code for obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce. The lawyer stated that the defendant's counterfeit goods are stored in large quantities in the Baohe and Donglai foreign warehouses, and the police station will search them. Therefore, he requested that the case be adjourned. Subsequently, Xia Sihua, the representative of the Meilun Factory, testified that all the fabrics woven by Meilun are yarn-warp and yarn-weft, while the defendant's counterfeit products are thread-warp and yarn-weft, which is immediately obvious. Furthermore, the representative of the Hongzhang Factory testified that when the fabrics dyed by Hongzhang are burned with fire, the yarn will immediately curl up, while the yarn of inferior goods will remain straight and not shrink after burning. All of these can be tested immediately. The defendant then hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to request bail for release pending trial, but the police station's lawyer immediately stood up to oppose, stating that there is still a lot of evidence waiting to be investigated, and if the defendant is granted bail, there is a risk of him destroying it. Judge Ge then denied the request and ordered the defendant to be detained for trial at a later date.</p>

<p>A Fisherman Electrocuted and Dies</p>
<p>The electrical wires on Song Park Road in Zhabei were all destroyed by the Japanese army after the war, resulting in broken wires scattered everywhere. The day before yesterday, a fisherman named Jia, about 40 years old, passed through the area and, unaware of the electricity, picked up an electrical wire to help him walk. Unexpectedly, upon touching it, he was immediately electrocuted and fell to the ground, dying on the spot. Since the fisherman had no family, the local leader, Yang Junsheng, reported the incident to the local court for verification.</p>

<p>Colluding in Fraud</p>
<p>The Yongyu Company Entrusted the Wrong People</p>
<p>Chairman Has Filed a Lawsuit</p>
<p>The Yongyu Heji Textile Co., Ltd., located at No. 3 Jiqing Lane, Jiangxi Road, was established in 1930. In March of last year, the company's board of directors elected Liu Manruo as the Standing Director and hired Gu Ziyan as the Deputy Manager to assist in handling company affairs. In April of this year, the shareholders held a general meeting and decided to hire accountant Xu Guangde to investigate all business accounts. As a result of the audit, it was discovered that Liu and Gu had been colluding in fraud. The methods of fraud included: (1) Fabricating account names and share amounts on the company's blank stock certificates to borrow money from banks, totaling 80,000 taels; (2) Purchasing large quantities of American cotton without initially recording them in the accounts, and only recording them in the company's accounts when losses were incurred, amounting to more than 100,5241 taels; (3) Misappropriating 176,547 taels and 89 cents; and (4) Liu Manruo personally misappropriating 13,271 taels and 95 cents. The company's chairman, Xu Shengchan, hired lawyers Zhang Shijian, Wu Jingxiong, and Yu Chengxiu to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Local Court against Liu and Gu for embezzling shareholders' funds, engaging in speculation, and misappropriating public funds, requesting that they be summoned and punished under Articles 357 and 366 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu opened the court to hear the case. Both defendants failed to appear in court. According to bailiff Jin Wanyun, Gu lives at No. 1 Yanping Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, and Liu lives at No. 13 Fenjin Lane, Xiahfei Road. Upon summoning them, it was reported that they had both left Shanghai. Therefore, the plaintiff's lawyer requested the issuance of arrest warrants, and Judge Wu ordered the case to be adjourned pending further investigation.</p>

<p>A Young Woman Impersonates a Relative and Picks Her Up in a Car</p>
<p>Real Family Members Went to Visit, But She Was Gone</p>
<p>Song Xueyi, a native of Wujin, residing at No. 189 Jinde Lane, Route Muro Ming in the Public Concession, has a daughter named Bing Shu, nine years old. In mid-March of this year, she was sent to study at the Chongde Girls' School in Xujiahui and boarded at the school. According to the school's regulations, boarding students are allowed to be visited by family members every Wednesday. Therefore, the Song family sent someone to visit every Wednesday for the past four months, and everything was fine. Unexpectedly, the other day, Song's father, Xueyi, went to visit in person but could not find his daughter. According to Vice Principal Zhou of the school, at 8:00 AM on a certain morning, an unknown young woman arrived at the school in a car, claiming that the student Song Bing Shu's aunt was critically ill and urgently wanted Bing Shu to return home to visit. At that time, the principal saw that the woman was serious and did not suspect anything, so she allowed her to take Bing Shu away. Song Xueyi was shocked and bewildered upon hearing this, as there was no such matter. He immediately sent people to search everywhere, but there was no news. He then reported the matter to Liu Yunfang, the head of the Sixth District's Second Precinct, who forwarded it to the Municipal Security Bureau to investigate. It is reported that the bureau has sent the girl's photograph to the police departments of the two concessions and all districts to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Resembling a Worker</p>
<p>Suffered Five Knife Wounds</p>
<p>On the open space next to the Kang Nao Tuo Road and Yanping Road in Western Shanghai, yesterday morning at about 6:20 AM, a murdered, unidentified male corpse was discovered. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Discovery: Yesterday, just as dawn was breaking, on the open space next to Kang Nao Tuo Road (constructed by the Shanghai Municipal Council beyond the boundary) and Yanping Road, next to the Shen Garden dog racing track, Police Chief Li of the Kangjia Bridge Police Station in the Sixth District was on patrol when he noticed a man lying dead on the ground, his head covered in blood. Suspecting that he had been murdered, he immediately reported it to the District Chief.</p>
<p>Murder Scene: After receiving the report, District Chief Zhang of the Sixth District instructed Inspector Xu to conduct a thorough investigation. It was found that the murdered, unidentified male corpse was about 30 years old, wearing a blue cloth jacket, a black small cloth shirt underneath, black cloth trousers, straight woolen shoes, and had a shaved head, resembling a worker. His neck was tightly wrapped with a hemp rope. There were two forceful wounds on the top of his head, two on the back of his head, and one on the side of his face, totaling five knife wounds. A sharp blade was found on the ground next to the corpse. It is believed that the murderer strangled him with a hemp rope and then stabbed him to death with a sharp blade.</p>
<p>Request for Examination: District Chief Zhang, considering that the matter was a murder case, immediately instructed local leader Shen Jinlin to report it to the local court, requesting that personnel be sent to examine it. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Yang was dispatched by the court, along with an examiner, to examine the scene. It was determined that the unidentified male corpse had indeed been strangled and stabbed to death. There were rope marks on his neck, and a total of five knife wounds on his head. As the corpse's relatives could not be found, the local leader was instructed to report to the hall to prepare a coffin and collect the corpse. It is also reported that the relevant police station also sent officers to examine the scene and take a photograph.</p>

<p>Requests Exemption from Liquor Tax in Hongkou District</p>
<p>Public Works Department Responds Vaguely</p>
<p>Decision to Continue the Struggle</p>
<p>The Sauce and Liquor Trade Association, previously due to members such as Fulai in the Hongkou District jointly submitting a letter to the association, requesting that it forward a letter to the Public Works Department requesting exemption from liquor tax for one quarter due to the war period, forwarded the request with the circumstances. The association has now received a reply from the Public Works Department, stating that a list of all numbers eligible for tax exemption must be submitted for review. The wording is vague and there is still no satisfactory answer. The association specially convened a meeting of sauce and liquor merchants in the Hongkou District at the Liquor Trade Association in the city to discuss the matter. Over 200 people attended. According to the report, dozens of companies, including Sheng Taifeng, Yi Kang, and Lao Fulai, have already been exempted from liquor tax for two months. Many have paid liquor tax for the entire spring and summer seasons, and it should be considered how to remedy this. After discussion, it was decided to continue the struggle. The points of request are as follows: (1) Base the liquor tax exemption standard on the patrol and concession exemption area; (2) Those who have paid the full liquor tax for the spring and summer seasons should be deducted from the autumn liquor tax; (3) When filling out the autumn liquor tax tickets, the amount of exemption should be deducted to avoid disputes when collecting the tax; (4) The form for filling out the exemption should be easily filled out by the sauce and liquor merchants and submitted to the Chinese Taxpayer Association for transfer to the Public Works Department for approval.</p>

<p>At 9:30 yesterday morning, six or seven well-dressed robbers suddenly arrived at No. 3, West Lane, Renmei Lane, West Xinqiao Street, French Concession. Under the pretext of searching for opium, two of the robbers, armed with pistols, first drove all the people upstairs downstairs and locked them in the east side room, then went upstairs to rob.

The Luo family in the east wing lost more than 100 yuan. The second landlord, surnamed Bian, was not affected because no one was at home. The luckiest was the reporter who rented the front east wing room downstairs, who was not visited. Afterwards, the victims reported the situation to the police station, requesting a pursuit.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce: Since the joint organization of the National Products Exhibition, the business of the National Goods Market has greatly increased. The participating factories and stores are specially collecting exquisite products everywhere to display and sell in order to meet customer demand. The cloth department of the Hongzhang Textile Factory in the market, in view of the recent summer season, has specially purchased various colors of thin serge from the Dalong Woolen Factory, with prices starting from 68 cents per foot, and iridescent serge at 88 cents per foot, which can be said to be the lowest prices ever. The Dalong Factory was newly established by Lu Wenshao, with complete organization and excellent products. Mr. Lu is determined to defeat imported goods and is willing to make special sacrifices, which is a very good intention. The Shanghai Zhanghua Woolen Factory also has various serges and camel wool entrusted to the factory for sale, and the price per foot is even lower. In addition, the market has new products invented by the Zengsheng Factory, such as waxed thread, hanging palm thread, yellow lining leather cord, hemp cord ball yarn, etc. It is said that the sales to various ports in the Nanyang Islands are very reputable, and it is indeed a good news for the national goods industry in our country.</p>
<h3 id="e216">The Truth About the Jiaotong University Car Theft Case <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The matter of the traffic university sending a letter to the Public Concession police station to assist in the investigation of the theft case this time has aroused considerable attention from the outside. According to a certain gentleman in charge of the school, a student lost a bicycle a few days ago, and the owner earnestly requested the general affairs office to investigate. The car only had a concession license. General Affairs Officer He believed that handling theft cases was the responsibility of the office, so he wrote a letter to the Xuhui Public Security Bureau, requesting it to investigate, and also wrote a letter to the police station at the same time, because the car license was issued by the police station, requesting them to pay attention to assisting in the investigation, in order to return the lost property. Afterwards, the Public Security Bureau and the police station sent people to the General Affairs Office the next day to inquire about the theft, so as to handle it and asked the school policeman on duty that day to go to the police station to inquire about everything in person. There was no detention. The outside world did not understand the truth and caused misunderstandings. As for the school principal, Li, because he inspected the affairs of the two colleges in Beiping and Tangshan, he had already gone north. Now that the school's person in charge has learned of this matter, he believes that the general affairs officer, He, sent a letter to the police station without being approved by the authorities. It was indeed improperly handled and he has been suspended. Also, the school police are established by the school itself and are not sent by the Public Security Bureau.</p>

<p>They Waited Too Long for the Tugboat and Fled</p>
<p>Two Crew Members Shot by Robbers</p>
<p>Cao Ahe, a local, owned a small vessel. The other day, he loaded 100 bales of yarn for a certain company and moored it overnight at the Sima Road pier. Unexpectedly, at 12:00 PM, eight robbers, each armed with a gun, jumped onto the boat, tied up the crew members in a corner, and forbade them from making any noise. When Gu Haifu, a crew member from Chongming, shouted loudly, he was shot in the arm by the robbers with a Mauser pistol. The bullet did not penetrate, and Gu was injured and fell on the boat. Cai Dalang, also from Chongming, was also severely injured by the robbers with an iron rod. However, the robbers were very ambitious. Their goal was to use a small tugboat to tow the entire boatload of yarn away and sell it, but the hired tugboat did not arrive after a long wait. Fearing that waiting too long would cause them to be discovered by the police, the robbers went ashore and fled. Gu Haifu, who was shot with a Mauser bullet, was able to go to Renji Hospital for treatment, and it is said that the bullet has been removed. After this case occurred, the Customs Water Police Station sent four detectives, Nos. 19, 73, 36, and 40, to the empty dock on Sima Road. A suspect, Huang Fuqiang, 30 years old, from Chongming, was captured and immediately taken into custody for interrogation.</p>

<p>A local woman, Pan Ding, 50 years old, residing at No. 633, upstairs, North Chengdu Road, Chenjiabang, Xinza, recently contracted typhoid fever and could not be cured. In the morning alone she went outside, took a car to the No. 1 Wharf on Yangjingbang, and jumped into the river to kill herself. When the fisherman Ding Xiuchun encountered, he immediately pulled her out of the water, but she had already died. He then moved the body to the dock and reported it to the Central Police Station, who telegraphed the Customs Water Patrol Police Station and ordered the police to take the body back. The corpse had a wound on his head which was probably injured when she fell into the water. Hua Detective Ge Changsheng was sent to send the corpse to the corpse inspection office of the Nanshi Relief Bureau, and reported to the local court to send people to inspect it. At 2:30 in the afternoon, the daughter of the deceased, A Cai, came to the police station to ask for the corpse. The police chief ordered the to go to the Relief Bureau to claim the body.</p>

<p>Three Dye Workers and an Old Woman Die Tragically</p>
<p>Next to the Qingyun Bridge on Qingyun Road in Zhabei, opposite the World Grand Theater, there is an open space of about three acres with green grass and bamboo fences, which has always been the drying yard of the Jiuda Dyeing Factory at No. 693 Tiantong'an Road. Yesterday (the 14th), at about 10:00 AM, four dye workers from the factory, including Pan A Chao, were resting on the lawn after finishing work in the yard and took out the pre-brought playing cards to play. While they were in high spirits, two Jiangbei scavenger children were digging for garbage under the bamboo fence along Qingyun Road in the yard when they suddenly touched a wire. A loud explosion suddenly occurred in the yard. The two children knew they had caused trouble and ran away in terror. However, the four dye workers sitting in the yard were caught off guard and unable to escape. As a result, two workers, Wang Bingcai and He Aqing, were wounded by the bomb and were in critical condition. The other two, Pan A Chao and Xu Jinquan, died on the spot. When the bomb exploded, the shrapnel flew out more than 30 feet, reached the overhanging building at the entrance of Tianshou Lane to the north of the yard, blasting a hole, shattering the glass windows. When the shrapnel landed, it pierced the chest and back of a Changshu old woman who was standing idly at the entrance of the alley, residing at No. 1 of the lane, in Xu Rongxing's clothing store, killing her instantly. It is said that the old woman was 66 years old. She had taken refuge elsewhere during the war and had only returned for less than a month before suddenly dying tragically. After the incident, the Jiuda Dyeing Factory reported to the Public Security Bureau's Fifth District Office and the local court to inspect the scene. Three injured workers, Wang Binglin, Shen Changqing, and He Zhiqing, were all sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, Wang Binglin's legs were blown off and he was severely injured. He arrived at the hospital at about 10:00 AM and died of his injuries at 2:30 PM. Shen Changqing was injured in his right leg, and He Zhiqing was wounded in his leg and waist. The injuries were quite severe. All of the injured were from Shaoxing.</p>

<p>Clearing Accumulated Cases in War Zones</p>
<p>Dispatching the Head of the First Criminal Court to be Responsible for Clearing</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the Shanghai First Special District Local Court has been close to the war zone. Therefore, the litigants often feared being caught in the crossfire when the court date arrived, and could not appear in court to respond to the lawsuit. After the end of the war, due to the relocation of addresses, most could not be reached. Although President Zhou Xianjue issued a notice, urging the litigants to report their addresses within a certain period and await summons, this series of twists and turns resulted in a mountain of civil lawsuits in the court. Now that the situation in society has completely recovered, President Zhou has decided to actively clear the accumulated cases in the shortest possible time, so as not to burden the people for too long with lawsuits. He has appointed Zhou Han, the head of the First Criminal Court, to be solely responsible for clearing the accumulated civil cases from this month. After being entrusted, Judge Zhou immediately consulted with Li Hu, the head of the Civil Court, and immediately began to receive the cases accumulated during the war, arranging the order of trial, so as to expedite the trial and end it as soon as possible. As for the duties of the First Criminal Court, which rotate three days a week on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, President Zhou has separately appointed criminal judges Feng Shide and Shen Bingrong to take turns as acting judges.

<p>He Zhuoxian, Director of the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, yesterday sent letters to various trade associations, stating that Chinese merchants have often disregarded trademark rights and interests, resulting in countless cases of trademark infringement by others due to unregistered trademarks, causing business losses. The Bureau is in charge of trademark administration and believes that trademark registration is of great importance to the development of commerce and the interests of merchants. Universal registration is the only way to fulfill the intention of the state in establishing a specialized bureau. Many of your members have already been using trademarks but have not applied for registration. The hope is that your association will assist in the investigation, widely publicize this information, and instruct those with unregistered trademarks to register with the Bureau immediately.

<p>Gold wire straw hats are a good product to defend against the sun in summer, produced in various parts of Zhejiang. In the past, they were all made by small Luzon hat shops and then sold on the market. Recently, there are quite a few Chinese people who have established their own hat factories. Now there is the Edson Hat Factory, which is purely run by Chinese and specializes in making gold wire straw hats, which are distributed to various stores for retail. The factory has specially set up a store at 40 Daxin Street, Simalu Road, which has officially opened. In order to favor customers, they are selling at a low price of eight cents per size, from the 15th of this month for three weeks. It is expected that there will be many customers at that time. However, the factory has just been established and lacks experience, so the hats made may be slightly inferior to those made by small Luzon. Those who love Chinese goods are encouraged to provide guidance.</p>

<p>Additional Shares of 10,000 Yuan Raised</p>
<p>The Daxing Vegetable Market, built at the intersection of Zhongxing Road and Datong Road in Zhabei, was originally scheduled to open on February 1st of this year. Unexpectedly, on the evening of January 28th, the war suddenly broke out, leading to its suspension. Later, the vegetable market was bombed by Japanese projectiles, causing heavy losses. Although it has now been repaired and completed, the original share capital of 30,000 yuan has already been used up. The current repair costs are all borrowed by the general manager, Yang Dexin, from various places. Therefore, at about 2 p.m. yesterday, all the shareholders were specially convened to hold a meeting to discuss the matter. As a result, it was resolved that each share of the original 20 shares of regular shares, each worth 1,500 yuan, totaling 30,000 yuan, would increase by one additional share each, each share being set at 500 yuan, totaling 10,000 yuan, to offset the losses and repair costs of this war. At that time, there were already four shares that had been subscribed. The rest must be paid successively. Finally, it was decided that the official opening would be on July 1st.

<p>Falsely Claiming to be a Anti-Drug Association Investigator</p>
<p>Searching for Opium and Extorting Huge Sums of Money</p>
<p>The Victim Who Smokes is Also Convicted</p>
<p>Ni Jie, a native of Haimen who claims to be a teacher at Peizheng School, lives at No. 19 Huaxingfang, Yangshupu Road. At around 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, together with Shi Lifeng, a teacher at the same school, he posed as an investigator of the Anti-Drug Association, carrying a forged official document from Zhong Ketuo, the deputy director of the Anti-Drug Association, and a submission from Lu Yaoming, a reporter. They suddenly went to the home of Tang Youguang (also known as Tang Biekai), a resident of No. 16 Shouchun Lane, Metthurst Road, claiming to be ordered to come and search for opium. When they saw a set of opium lamps and guns and half a tael of opium paste on the bed, they pointed out that he was selling it and threatened to extort 2,000 yuan. Tang's wife secretly went out and secretly reported to two Chinese detectives at No. 297 and No. 999, saying that there was a robbery alarm in her house. The detectives rushed to the scene, but Ni and others had already escaped after hearing the news. Ni Jie was arrested on the spot, while Shi Lifeng escaped. The detectives then entered the room and took Tang Youguang and the opium paraphernalia to the Gordon Road Police Station. The police chief ordered them to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. According to Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, Ni Jie is now accused of attempted extortion under Article 370 of the Criminal Code, and Tang Youguang is accused of illegally possessing opium paraphernalia and smoking opium under Article 11 of the Anti-Opium Law. The above circumstances were described in detail, and two forged official documents were presented to the court for investigation. When questioned, Ni Jie confessed that the official document was delivered by Yang Shouren, Tang's brother-in-law. Yesterday, he went to Tang's house with Yang and Shi, and Yang and Shi talked with Tang, but he did not open his mouth. Regarding the extortion of 2,000 yuan, he claimed that he did not know about it. Tang hired a lawyer to appear in court to defend him and admitted to smoking opium. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession and sentenced Ni Jie to three months of imprisonment for conspiracy to forge documents and attempted extortion. The forged instructions and submissions were confiscated. Tang was sentenced to one month of imprisonment and fined 200 yuan. The opium paraphernalia were confiscated.</p>

<p>The Fuzhou Pharmacy Second Branch on North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road, which was forced to close down due to losses from the Shanghai Incident, has been closed for several months. Now that summer is approaching and epidemics are prevalent, citizens in the northern district feel inconvenienced to buy epidemic prevention and hygiene products. The company's store affairs meeting decided yesterday that the second branch will reopen temporarily to satisfy public expectations. The store is expected to resume business today. Those who live near the northern district can buy medicines much more conveniently.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Li Bixia Accuses Weng and Husband <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Demanding Alimony of 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Wu Zhenxiang, the son of Wu Tingfan, manager of Yongju Bank in Ningbo Road, remarried Li Bixia, the elder sister of Li Yumen, an employee of the Bank of Communications, after being divorced in 1925. They married in their hometown of Zhenhai. At that time, the bride was still young. Soon, Wu took his beloved wife to Shanghai, and they separated from the big family and lived in No. 107 Zixia Road, Nanshi, enjoying the sweet life of a husband and wife. It was appropriate to enjoy the joy of harmony, but for several years, there has been little harmony and much discord. Now, they are involved in a public lawsuit. Li is accusing her husband and father-in-law of neglecting alimony, and is asking the court to order the two defendants to pay alimony of 30,000 yuan. The Wu father and son, being accused, hired lawyer Wang Peiyuan to file a plea, stating that the plaintiff had been disrespectful to elders and had beaten the children born to the previous wife after she married into the family. After persuasion by relatives and friends, she separated from her relatives, hoping that she would repent. However, shortly after moving, she relapsed and beat the children, causing public outrage among the neighbors. The landlord refused to renew the lease. She moved to Shanghai in February last year. However, she became obsessed with the glamour of Shanghai and spent money extravagantly. The defendant suffered a terrible business failure and was worried about the plaintiff's unreasonable troubles. As a result of resentment, he became ill and returned to his hometown in November last year to recuperate, as advised by the doctor. The plaintiff was unwilling to return with him and was given a monthly living allowance of 30 yuan. The plaintiff took advantage of the defendant's return to his hometown and moved all the furniture and clothes from the Shanghai residence, which was the same as when she forcibly withdrew 2,000 yuan of deposits and jewelry from her predecessor's Ningbo Yuanchun and other banks. When the defendant returned to Shanghai in April, the plaintiff avoided meeting him and fabricated facts, falsely accusing him of abuse and abandonment, and openly published it in the newspaper, which was obviously for another purpose. After receiving the complaint sent by Junyuan to solve the problem, I learned that she was demanding 30,000 yuan on the basis of false words. When the defendant heard about it, his old illness became worse.</p>
<p>This kind of unreasonable request is not credible in law or emotion, and so on. Yesterday morning, Judge Li summoned the plaintiff and her lawyer He Yiyun to court and stated that she was now unable to pay the litigation fees due to poverty and requested litigation relief. The defendant's lawyer, Wang Peiyuan, objected, saying that the plaintiff had the money to publish in the newspaper, and that her clothing today was not like that of a poor person and did not meet the conditions for relief. Judge Li said that the plaintiff's request for litigation relief would be verified later and approved. As for the claim for clothing and other items, she was ordered to provide a list within three days to await interrogation.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Western detectives of the Mailan Police Station in the French Concession learned the day before yesterday that Tongtaihao at No. 3 Zhonghuali, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, was secretly selling opium for profit, which is a clear violation of the prohibition. They immediately rushed to search the place and found Jiang Fuyuan packing opium in the Tingzijian room, while the owner, Tan Chushan, was sitting beside him monitoring. They were arrested together. Six pounds of opium, a balance, a small wooden box, a large pair of scissors, ten yuan of opium money, and six double-corner coins were found under the floor and in the pavilion. They were taken to the police station. The police chief found that Tan had also been arrested and punished twice for privately selling opium. He ordered him to be detained. Yesterday, he was sent to the Second Special Court. At 3 p.m., Criminal Judge Wang Wangxu came to the First Criminal Court to hear the case. First, Gu Shouxu, the police station's lawyer, stated the case and sued according to Article 6 of the Anti-Opium Law. Bao Tan Bian Zhixiang also reported the process of searching and arresting the defendants, and presented the opium evidence to the court. Tan confessed that he used to do opium business, but has now stopped. The soil found in the search was left over from before and he did not dare to sell it. Jiang confessed that he was an apprentice and was only in charge of packing and entertaining friends. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. The court verified the confession and announced that Tan Chushan was sentenced to six months of imprisonment and fined 700 yuan for selling opium. Jiang Fuyuan was sentenced to three months of imprisonment and fined 300 yuan. If the fines are converted to imprisonment, they will be calculated at three yuan per day. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined will be offset against the imprisonment for one day for every two days. The opium found in the search will be confiscated. At the same time, the Chinese and Western detectives of the police station learned that Yuanyuhaho at No. 5 Zhonghuali was also selling opium privately. They went to search the place, but there was no evidence. When the detectives were about to return to the police station, Liu Fanggui happened to bring a small bag of opium to the store and wanted to return the cash. He was stopped by the detectives and questioned. Zhang Zixian, the accountant of the store, and Zhang Senfa, the apprentice, were speechless and had no words to answer. The detectives took them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Second Special District. The police station's lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated the case. Zhang Zixian and Zhang Linfa confessed that they used to do opium business, but have now stopped. The rest of their words were evasive. Liu Fanggui confessed that she had asked a friend to buy it from Yuanyuhaho a month ago because her mother was sick, but she did not smoke it, so she brought it to return it. Judge Wu verified the confession and ordered that the case be heard again at a later date. The defendants were sent back to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e246">The Economic Crisis in China <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>By Mu Xiangyue</p>
<p>The economic crisis in China is not something that started today, but it is at its worst now. The reasons are very complicated, and the biggest reason lies in the economic aggression of the imperialist powers. Economic aggression is different from political aggression. Political aggression uses force.</p>
<p>For example, the violent Japanese aggression in Northeast China and the attack on Shanghai were of great harm, but it was obvious and could make the people of the whole country feel heartbroken and vow never to forget. Economic aggression is different. It replaces military warfare with commercial warfare. Imperialist powers, with the advantage of advanced industrial countries, use machine production to suppress our manual production. Their power penetrates deeply into our inland areas. Even remote and desolate places are filled with foreign goods. That is, there is the power of imperialist powers everywhere, absorbing our money invisibly to control our fate. Over the years, it has made our country's economy increasingly bankrupt, and even though our people suffer, they still do not know why. Political aggression is like an acute infectious disease, which can still be resisted significantly with epidemic prevention methods. Economic</p>
<p>aggression is like chronic tuberculosis, which makes people gradually lose weight and die without realizing it. Therefore, the economic crisis in our country today did not come in a day or two. The outflow of rights and interests has been going on for decades. However, it is only today that the symptoms have gradually become apparent and the economic pain has deepened day by day. Looking forward, it is truly chilling. Now, in order to awaken the people of the country, based on customs reports and the current economic panic, it is used as factual proof.</p>
<p>Since the first year of the Republic of China, the number of foreign goods imported through customs has exceeded the number of local goods exported every year. From the first year to the twentieth year, the least was in the eighth year of the Republic of China, when imports exceeded exports by more than 16 million taels. The most was in the twentieth year, when imports exceeded exports by more than 55.9 million taels. In total, in the 20 years, imports exceeded exports by more than 391.2 million customs taels, equivalent to more than 435.8 million taels of Shanghai silver, and more than 600 billion yuan in national currency at the current market price. May I ask, in a short period of 20 years, because the people of the country like to use foreign goods, making the outflow of money reach more than 600 billion yuan, how can our country not be poor, and how can the national economic situation not experience panic? Not only that, but if the people of our country can understand the cause of poverty, which is due to the excessive outflow of money, and urgently rise up to work hard to produce and promote domestic goods, then the disease can still be cured. Unfortunately, economic panic is still economic panic, and those who like to use foreign goods still like to use foreign goods. According to customs reports, in the three months of this spring, imported foreign goods were 26,100</p>
<p>More than 10,000 taels, and exported local goods were more than 14,100,000 taels. Imports exceeded exports by more than 12,100,000 taels. Not only that, even in Shanghai alone, imports exceeded exports by more than 52,200,000 taels in January, more than 14,400,000 taels in February, and more than 26,600,000 taels in March. In Shanghai alone, in three months, imports exceeded exports by more than 93,300,000 taels. According to Western newspapers, in April, imports in Shanghai alone were more than 54,400,000 taels, and exports were more than 9,900,000 taels. Imports exceeded exports by more than 44,400,000 taels. Therefore, in Shanghai alone, in the four months of this year, imports exceeded exports by more than 138,800,000 taels, equivalent to more than 200 million yuan in national currency. If we consider the whole country, it is at least more than 166 million taels, equivalent to more than 260 million yuan in national currency. This year, when the country is in trouble, in just four months, imports exceeded exports by more than 260 million yuan. The future is boundless, and I really don't know how to continue. The above is only from the perspective of numbers. The economic danger in China is already obvious. Now, let's examine the types of imported goods in the customs report.</p>
<p>In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the total value of imported goods was more than 130.9 million taels. Among them, cotton goods were more than 14.9 million taels, cotton was more than 13.2 million taels, rice was more than 12.1 million taels, sugar was more than 8.6 million taels, tobacco leaves and cigarettes were more than 5.6 million taels, flour was more than 3.1 million taels, seafood was more than 2.5 million taels, wool fabrics were more than 2.4 million taels, fruits, medicinal materials, etc. were more than 2.3 million taels, timber was more than 2.3 million taels, rayon was more than 1.4 million taels, wheat was more than 1.2 million taels, and canned food was more than 1.2 million taels. These are all necessities for people's lives and all rely on foreign goods. Not only is the outflow of money fearful, but in case of war in the world, traffic is blocked, and foreign goods cannot be imported or imports are reduced, will the people of our country face the danger of lack of supply or interruption of supply of food and clothing? As for machinery, the tools of production, the quantity imported in the same year was only worth more than 4.4 million taels, accounting for only 3.38% of the total import amount of more than 130.9 million taels. It can be seen that more than 90% of imported foreign goods are consumables. Year after year, consumption after consumption, poverty will inevitably become more and more serious. This is what the people of our country must realize.</p>
<p>The symptoms of China's economic illness have gradually become apparent. Domestic finance is becoming increasingly depleted. Exported goods are decreasing day by day, and imported goods are increasing day by day, making domestic cash concentrated in Shanghai. Because cash is concentrated in Shanghai, Shanghai has a surplus of cash, the foreign interest rate shrinks, and the silver exchange rate is low, with no use at all. However, the provinces in the interior, due to financial depletion, lack cash to purchase Shanghai drafts, resulting in soaring prices of Shanghai drafts. Recently, in Jiangxi, because imported foreign goods all come from Shanghai, they have to purchase Shanghai drafts to cope with the situation. At the same time, because too few local goods are exported, there is no money to offset them, resulting in soaring exchange rates. In Jiangxi, purchasing 1,000 taels of Shanghai drafts requires 1,438 yuan in national currency, which is more than 50 yuan higher than usual. As a result, not only has the price of foreign goods in the interior increased by more than 5%, but also local goods from other provinces that are transported to Jiangxi via Shanghai are greatly affected by the high exchange rates. This is just an example. In fact, economic panic is everywhere. It is not just Jiangxi. The main reason is that in the provinces in the interior, soldiers and bandits are fighting, taxes and levies are heavy, transportation is inconvenient, and freight rates are high, resulting in local goods not being able to be exported, or not easily exported. Farmers and workers have no profit to gain, their livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult, and production is decreasing day by day, resulting in the need to rely on foreign goods for their lives, and domestic finance is thus in dire straits, almost beyond salvation. China has always been known as an agricultural country. Today, rice, wheat, cotton, timber, and tobacco leaves are all major imports of agricultural products. Among them, the import quantity of cotton cloth is the largest. Therefore, today, all of us in the country must concentrate our efforts. Therefore, today, all of us in the country must concentrate our efforts and vigorously implement three things. First, remove production obstacles and work hard to increase production. Second, manage foreign trade and control the import of foreign goods. Third, awaken national thought and work hard to promote domestic goods. All these three things are related. If we can work together and implement them practically, then the economic crisis in China will not become deeper and deeper, and we will have a day to get out of danger and ascend to a prosperous road. This is what I sincerely pray for.</p>

<h3 id="e247">Reading Less Can Reduce Pain <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom</p>
<p>My life is both laughable and painful. On one hand, I see foreign science developing day by day, and on the other hand, I see everything in China declining day by day. All I have seen in my life are these contradictory phenomena, how painful! If I could read less, especially less foreign books, I could reduce some pain. But now, everything I see is desolate, and everything I hear is alarming! China's decline, from the Boxers to the Party-State, gets worse with each passing day. Foreign countries are progressing day by day, not only in science but also in politics. For example, all countries used to be monarchies, but now almost all have become democracies. Even countries that maintain a monarchy have become constitutional monarchies. The British monarch has always been a fake emperor. Belgium, a small country, has also had a hereditary fake emperor since 1830. It's funny to say, most of the European emperors were invited from other countries. For example, the Belgian monarch was requested from Germany, and the Bourbon royal family of France was not French themselves. In short, the European concept of emperor is completely different from the Chinese. Therefore, Europeans have the idea of colonialism.</p>
<p>We Chinese are different. We have always had the idea that "there can be only one master in the sky and one king on earth." Therefore, we close ourselves off and have absolutely no idea of colonialism. In fact, when it comes to the sovereignty of politics, neither family rule nor public rule is a thorough way of saying it. To get to the bottom of the matter, sovereignty belongs neither to one person nor to everyone, but to the Creator. In the face of the Creator, all human beings are equal. Therefore, sovereignty belongs to the Creator, and therefore it belongs to everyone. (Editor's note: Old Man Xiang has a firm belief in religion. He advocates democracy, but his theory of democracy is based on religion. It can be said to be a theocratic theory of democracy. It is recorded here for the reference of those who study political theory.)</p>
<p>Sovereignty belongs to the Creator and to everyone. But anyone can fill the main body. For example, the spirit tablet has a soul, but the spirit tablet can be made of any wood. The Japanese worship the Emperor, but the Emperor has no power. This is spirit tablet-ism. The Chinese worship the dead as emperors. This is an innovation of the Party-State, which is far less good than spirit tablet-ism.</p>

<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>When did the art of character divination begin? It is also called character splitting and breaking characters. It existed before the Sui and Tang Dynasties. The key is to seize the opportunity. Sometimes, it is unknowable. When the Patriotic Women's School moved to Chen Garden on Jiangwan Road, Mr. Sun, who was in charge, worked very hard beforehand. Because several schools were competing for rent at the same time, it would be gone if he was a little slow. One day, Mr. Sun was on his way to Chen Garden. He was compelled by curiosity and tried a character at the door of "Little Confusion." It was the character "奮" (fèn, strive). He privately thought that he must strive to succeed. "Little Confusion" picked up a pen and split the character. The top part was "大" (dà, big), and the middle part was "佳" (jiā, good). He thought it was great. But then he combined it with "凶" (xiōng, ominous) to form "難" (nán, difficult). The bottom part was "田" (tián, field), which was a fruit without wood. So he judged it as "great calamity without fruit." Mr. Sun was still unconvinced and tried another character, "縱" (zòng, vertical, indulge). It was split as follows: the left side was "亂絲" (luàn sī, messy silk), and the top and middle parts were both "人" (rén, person). The right side was "疋" (pǐ, bolt of cloth) that could not become "走" (zǒu, walk). So he said that it was "walking vertically and horizontally without a way out." Mr. Sun was not deeply convinced and dismissed it with a smile. Later, the school's progress was very smooth. Within a year, classrooms were opened, assembly halls were added, and the school's affairs were thriving. He thought that "Little Confusion" was truly confused. Unexpectedly, the January 28th Incident occurred. The school happened to be in the war zone, and most of the school buildings were destroyed. Countless efforts were reduced to ashes. After many difficulties, he was able to find another school site and temporarily start classes. Then, he realized that the so-called "great calamity" was the great calamity of the country, and the "without fruit" meant being destroyed by the Japanese invaders. A year of operation yielded no results. Because it was in the war zone, it still could not operate normally. Therefore, it was said that "walking was impossible." Recently, when Mr. Sun talks about the school's affairs, he smiles and tells people about "great calamity without fruit." I am not a superstitious person, but I record this because it is quite enough to provide conversation.</p>

<p>The whale is the largest of the fish species. Overseas, whaling is regarded as one of the major industries. Its value is estimated at approximately US$500 to US$10,000 per tail. In recent years, whaling factories in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Norway have sprung up. The Norwegian whaling industry is particularly dominant in the world. Therefore, it is also striving for excellence in whaling methods. The June issue of a science magazine has a detailed record, which is excerpted and translated as follows.</p>
<p>In the past, whaling mainly used harpoons. However, whales rely on their huge size and strong resistance, and they are easily missed. It has now been abandoned and completely replaced with ammunition bombing. The method is to suspend bombs on the tips of iron rods and connect them with extremely thick leather wires. If the target is found, the mechanism is immediately activated for bombing. Whales rarely escape when they encounter it. At the same time, mobile factories are organized on ships, patrolling the sea day and night. The best performers can catch six to eight whales per ship per day. The largest whale can yield 75 boxes of oil, each box worth US$26, which can be made into 10,000 squares of high-quality soap. The bones are kept for making toothbrushes and umbrella handles. In order to prevent the extinction of whales, the Norwegian government recently passed a ban in the State Council to preserve whale seeds. Whales that are too small must not be captured. Female whales are absolutely forbidden to be slaughtered.</p>

<p>The Chinese Construction Society, organized by Mr. Zhu Qiqian, has elaborated on national studies and ancient architecture. Last year, it accidentally discovered 56 kinds of cultural relics of the Li family of Prince Qiyang. The ink marks are as new as before, and the ancient colors are brilliant. Recently, they were exhibited in the Central Park of Beiping. For a time, newspapers in the north and south were filled with reports. This article also records the beginning and end of the exhibition. I am a descendant of Prince Qiyang. Thinking of the merits of my ancestors and the longevity of my family, I can deeply think of Kang Le and feel the earnest attention of the people of the country. Recently, I received a letter from my family in Mingguang, stating that Yun Cheng and Lu Ping, my two great-uncles, will go to the old capital in North Beiping in about ten days to clarify the cultural relics stored on the ground and combine them with Beiping to make a complete whole. I dare not seek the happiness of one family, but also hope to help the national history.</p>
<p>Li Zhen, Duke of Cao, whose given name is Zhen, is the first ancestor of our Li family. His first wife was Princess Xiaoxin Cao of the Ming Dynasty, the elder sister of Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty. He was buried in Mingguang, about one mile southeast of the city, formerly known as the Village of Miracles. The naming of Mingguang was because Zhu Yuanzhang, Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty, was born there, and there was a purple light shrouded around it. Today, the so-called Diaper Beach, Erlang Temple, Moshan, and Xianghua Temple all have miracles. The joint tomb of the Duke and the Princess is about three feet high and rises like a small hill.

<p>— Recounted by Nie Zengjifen, Written by Nan Guijie</p>
<p>There are many books on people's livelihood and social economy. The British are better at it than our ancient philosophers. There are many college students who eat it, but few who use it. Those who do it are quick, and those who use it are comfortable. It is an immutable principle for all ages. Those who eat it but do not produce, specialize in trickery and plunder, and are the parasites of society. They are the so-called parasites that absorb surplus value. Those who use it comfortably refer to all luxury consumer goods. That is, as the Book of Documents says, "Do not do what is useless, harm what is useful, and the work will be accomplished. Do not value foreign objects, devalue useful objects, and the people will be prosperous." There are many other similar words in the Analects, Mencius, the Book of Documents, and the Book of Rites, which can all illuminate each other. Politics cannot be separated from social economy to establish a theory. Recently, people like Adam Smith and Karl Marx, although their words are detailed, their essence cannot add anything to our country's ancient philosophy. Then we know that the intelligence of our ancestors is unattainable. Once the principles of political economy are established, their establishment of education must also be based on these principles. Otherwise, the purpose of political economy cannot be achieved. Self-restraint is the principle of establishing education. Building railways is like knowing how to make trains. Ancient Chinese philosophers also knew the necessity of laying railway tracks. Because without tracks, even if the engine power is sufficient to pull the train, it will inevitably overturn. Now, many Western countries know the theory of social economy. However, if they do not understand the foundation of establishing education, they cannot fully promote its effectiveness. For example, the economic policy of Soviet Russia seems to be close to the advocacy of Confucius and Mencius. However, they only know how to restrict it from the legal perspective, and do not pay attention to the education of self-restraint, and they cannot eliminate the root causes of competition, deception, hatred, and killing. Moreover, domestic food is strangely expensive, and they do not strive to accumulate it, but instead export it at a low price. Luxury goods are not prohibited. The huge investment in factory equipment is not based on domestic needs, but is used to compete in foreign markets, attracting enemies and jealousy. They also set up military equipment to wait for it. All of this is a self-defeating way. Then they are still unable to stand on a solid foundation. If you want to find a way that can be great and long-lasting, there is no other way than our Confucianism. Why don't those who talk about political economy remove their prejudices and study the experimental theories that have been proven by historical facts with a calm mind?</p>
<p>Big tree. It is swaying on it. Anyone who takes the Jinpu train north and crosses Xiaokazhuang can see it from the east-facing window inside the car. There are three passages in front of the tomb.

However, the foundation stone still exists, and one can imagine its glory. In front of it are several stone horses and Zhongweng. The wind and rain have eroded it, and most of it is blurred, broken, and broken now.</p>

<p>— Wu Baozhi</p>
<p>A certain wealthy household in Dongshan, Dongting Lake, has an ear disease and is deaf. They run a foreign cloth business. When they were young, they went to Shanghai to do business and worked as a broker. Their monthly income was very meager. They were almost fifty years old, working hard every day. The spring clouds were difficult to unfold, and they only had expectations. They usually had a good reputation. Their friends admired their righteousness, and transactions were decided with a single word. Once, a Western ship imported a large amount of white flannel to Shanghai. A friend was entrusted by a Westerner to sell it quickly, so they asked Mr. So-and-so. They knocked on the door. Mr. So-and-so had not yet gotten up. They hurriedly put on their clothes and came out. Before they could say anything, they had to relieve themselves. They immediately turned into the small patio on the side of the door and urinated. The friend saw that the door was open but Mr. So-and-so did not come out, so they shouted loudly to explain their intention. Mr. So-and-so's sleepy eyes were not clear about what they were saying. The friend only saw them nod, so they hurriedly left. By the time Mr. So-and-so returned to see, the friend had left and closed the door and went back to sleep. The next day, the Empress Dowager died, and the whole country wore mourning clothes. An edict was issued to buy a large amount of white flannel. The official report arrived in Shanghai, and the merchants told each other that the price of flannel had soared a hundredfold. The matter was heard by Mr. So-and-so, who was just complaining about himself. The previous friend came running wildly. Without saying a word, they congratulated him. Mr. So-and-so was stunned and unable to respond. The friend said, "The star of wealth has arrived, why are you pretending to be hypocritical?" Mr. So-and-so was displeased. The friend said, "The large amount of white flannel is all in your hands. Now the market price has soared a hundredfold. Yesterday, one word made you a giant fortune." Mr. So-and-so argued hard and said that they had wrongly visited yesterday morning and that they were still drowsy and that their words had not yet entered their ears, so they had never agreed to their request. The friend was usually sincere and honest, so they told them that the Western merchant was eagerly waiting for a reply. They opened the door and Mr. So-and-so was relieving himself. They spoke and Mr. So-and-so nodded, so they did not wait for the signing procedure and immediately made a deal. By the time the Shanghai Gazette arrived, this was the only batch on the market. Mr. So-and-so suddenly realized. It turned out that what the friend thought was a nod was actually a shiver from the cold. They could not help but be dumbfounded. They then agreed to divide the profits equally. From then on, they ran their own foreign goods store and expanded their years of experience. They had a surplus every year. In less than ten years, their family fortune increased to several million. To this day, their descendants have not declined and have carried on their family. I have a long-standing relationship with Mr. So-and-so, so I know the whole story of their rise. People say that Mr. So-and-so was blessed by Heaven. They are truly a lucky child. I strongly doubt this statement. If Mr. So-and-so did not have an outstanding reputation and sound intelligence, even if they could get this opportunity, it would be in vain. It all depends on their inherent intelligence and reserve. The other day, I watched the Mingxing Company's "Lucky Star" and felt that luck cannot be sought by chance. I remembered the wealthy household Mr. So-and-so and wrote about it to further prove that my views are not wrong.</p>

Chengqi Officer sneered, "This is even more ridiculous. I don't know how many people have come to see the Commander-in-Chief today. If you all want us to keep asking the superiors, we four or five guys will break our legs and still be too busy. We must ask our Director to submit an official request to the Commander-in-Chief to send twice or three times as many Chengqi officers. Besides, the Commander-in-Chief has a bad temper. If he is annoyed, he will kick us a few times. Who will pay for the medical expenses to treat our injuries?" After saying this, he laughed loudly, then grabbed the name card and walked out angrily, muttering a lot of dirty words. He vaguely heard that he was scolding something and something playful. An Yutian was so angry that he could no longer bear it. He suddenly made up his mind. It doesn't matter if he doesn't see him. He followed the Chengqi officer's back and walked out. Unexpectedly, the Chengqi officer walked to the door and turned his head to scold him again, "You can't leave. I have already submitted the card. If the Commander-in-Chief summons you and I can't find you, how can I dismiss the job? Who asked you to come? Now that you're here, you can't just leave. It's not convenient." An Yutian couldn't leave and didn't want to fight them head-on, so he had to sit back and wait for a result. They wouldn't force him to spend the night here. But after An Yutian gave in, the Chengqi officers became even more arrogant, as if scaring monkeys with chickens, punishing one to warn a hundred, suppressing the dozen or so poor people sitting there, who didn't dare to breathe loudly. They waited until the lights came on and even passed the time when ordinary people had dinner. They clearly heard that Governor Ye had arrived at Xihua Garden to entertain foreign guests. A gust of wind blew over the military music from the banquet. The Chengqi officer stood by the door and issued an order-like statement with his eyes facing the sky, "The Commander-in-Chief has a banquet and can no longer meet guests. Everyone disperse. Those who want to come again, please come early tomorrow." These people were like receiving a special amnesty from the Chief of State, escaping the disaster of this prison. Each with an iron-green face, supporting a numb body, and drooping their heads, they filed out, as if being able to escape alive was already very fortunate. Who would dare to criticize the Chengqi officer's untouchable scales and question him why he didn't speak earlier? An Yutian had just escaped to the door mixed in the crowd when he heard the Chengqi officer scolding his back, "It's cheap for this kid. If the Commander-in-Chief weren't hosting guests tonight, everyone would hear that I would definitely trap this kid until midnight before forgiving him."</p>

<p>The Rebound of Foreign Exchange is Not Strong</p>
<p>Copper Coins Plummet by 7,500 Cash</p>
<p>Market Overview: After a surge the previous day, foreign exchange weakened again at midday. Whether it can continue to rise is uncertain. Yesterday morning, due to market sentiment, there was another rise, with a better trend than the previous day. However, closer observation suggests continuous upward movement is unlikely. Most people anticipate twists and turns, or even another downturn.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates: The opening exchange rate for "foreign exchange" was 1.5 fen higher than the previous day's midday rate, at 6 yuan, 9 jiao, 4 fen. At midday, supply and demand were equal, so the rate remained the same. "Silver exchange" remained at 8 fen in both the morning and afternoon, unchanged from the previous day. "Markup" rates were similar to yesterday, estimated at 8.9 fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small silver coins remained unchanged in the morning at 5 yuan, 9 jiao, 5 fen, with 4,000 jiao traded. At midday, it rose 2 fen to 5 yuan, 9 jiao, 7 fen, with 11,000 jiao traded. Guangdong small silver coins rose in response to the surge in foreign exchange, with the morning and midday rates both at 5 yuan, 9 jiao, 2 fen. 160,000 jiao were traded in the morning and 10,000 jiao at midday. Copper coins saw a sharp decline of 7,500 cash, to 417,000 cash. The reason for the decline is unknown, but the reduced volume of transactions suggests a possible supply shortage.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Exchange Inflow and Outflow: "Silver funds" received by banks yesterday were slightly lower than usual. Chinese merchants deposited 1.67 million, foreign merchants 1.78 million. Exchange remittances, cargo mortgages, telegraphic transfers, customs duties, miscellaneous items, etc., totaled over 8.1 million. 500,000 was deposited into warehouses and 400,000 withdrawn. Money shops and silver firms deposited over 23 million in single receipts, with "markup" funds totaling over 3.8 million, various remittances over 600,000, and cash receipts between 200,000 and 300,000. "Foreign funds": Remittances and drafts totaled 510,000 in the morning and 525,000 at midday. Banknotes were 40,000 each in the morning and afternoon. Off-market banknotes were 90,000 in the morning and 65,000 at midday. Bank trading was 500,000 in the morning and 400,000 at midday. Deposits and withdrawals by foreign firms totaled over 1.3 million. Banknote inflows and outflows were between 1.4 and 1.5 million. Money shops and foreign firms deposited over 4.9 million in single receipts, foreign "markup" funds totaled over 1.4 million, foreign exchange borrowing and lending totaled over 1.5 million, and foreign exchange trading by small money shops was between 500,000 and 600,000.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Gold Market: Rising Then Falling <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Continued Decline of 1.9 Tael</p>
<p>Small Range, Fluctuation of Around 5 Tael: Yesterday, the 14th, the listed gold price continued to weaken, rising then falling, with a daily range of about 5 tael. However, the trading volume remained small and scattered. Later, it continued to fall by about 2 tael. The initial opening was slightly higher, due to the decline in large bars. A certain bank continued to purchase over 100 bars of spot gold, sold through Yingfeng Heng, Tongfeng Heng, Dadecheng, etc., at a price of 25 tael, 2 jiao, 5 fen, thus supporting the market price. The subsequent easing of exchange rates and rumors of cheaper rates from a certain exchange, coupled with sales by Japanese banks to cover positions, led to panic selling by Dalian gangs, resulting in a sharp decline of over 4 tael. However, buying activity later pushed the price slightly higher, between 726 tael. The full-day situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Large Bars Reported a Decline, Opening Slightly Higher: The opening price for the early July contract was slightly higher by 5 qian, at 724 tael, 9 qian. The price of large bars fell by 1/16, with silver unchanged, continuing at 25 tael, 3 qian. Sales by Zhifeng Yong, etc., caused a drop to 24 tael, 5 qian. Yuan Mao Yong, Hengxing, Hongkang Yong, etc., entered the market, and a certain bank absorbed spot gold, increasing the price by 1 tael, 2 jiao, 5 fen compared to the previous day, pushing the market price up by over 1 tael to 25 tael, 8 qian. Foreign exchange remained stable. Initially, the bank traded the June British gold at 0.0625, and the October U.S. dollar could be sold at 31.4375 yuan. The British gold announcement remained unchanged, at 25 tael, 3 qian, to 26 tael. Subsequently, Dalian gangs and others sold to cover positions, slightly lower by 4 qian, until 10:20 AM, at 25 tael, 6 qian. Chinese banks traded the August British gold at 0.125. Later, Maijia Li and Anda traded the September U.S. dollar at 0.1875. The British absorbed the June British gold at 0.0625, and Yingfeng Heng, Yifeng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuhe, etc., came to buy, but the market price was very flat, increasing by only 4-5 qian per hour, reaching 26 tael, 1 qian by 11:20 AM. At this time, Zhifeng Yong, Bingxing, Futaiheng, Yuantai, etc., sold, and the Central Bank sold the June U.S. dollar at 0.6875 to Youli, resulting in a decline of 7-8 qian, to 25 tael, 3 qian. The midday closing was at 25 tael, 5 qian, with the quoted price still at 793 tael, a difference of 68 tael.</p>
<p>Dalian Bills Loose, a Sharp Drop of Over 4 Tael: The afternoon opening price was 25 tael, 3 qian. Small traders slightly increased their positions, to 25 tael, 6 qian. Hongkang Yong, Tongtaichang, etc., sold, but the market was quite stable, with a trading range of only 1-2 qian. Around 2:45 PM, a sudden wave of volatility occurred, due to news of loose Dalian bills and the willingness of banks to sell. The U.S. dollar also slightly eased, with the early July settlement at 0.75, then 0.8125. Anda offered the June British gold at 0.0625. Selling pressure arose in the market, with Wanxing, Shunli, Dadecheng, Bingxing, etc., selling aggressively, resulting in a drop of over 4 tael, after a long period of inactivity. At 3:00 PM, the price was 21 tael. Soon after, Dadecheng, Yifeng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Fuxing Yong, etc., took advantage of this to buy, and Datong Maihang, etc., bought the August U.S. dollar at 31.0625 yuan. Sumitomo Anda absorbed the October at 31.5 yuan. The Zhengjin absorbed the August British gold at 0.18125, and the gold price rebounded by 2 tael, 5 qian. However, the hourly increase was only 2-3 qian. At 4:00 PM, the price was 23 tael, 5 qian. Hengxing, Yuan Mao Yong, etc., sold 200-300 bars, slightly reducing the price by 4-5 qian.

<p>Bond Market Suddenly Surges in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Both the 2.0 Customs and Consolidated Tax Bonds Rebound by One Yuan or Several Jiao</p>
<p>Others Also Slightly Firm, But the Market Remains Very Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday's bond market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw very quiet futures trading in the morning, with only 1 million yuan transacted. The market picked up slightly in the afternoon as prices trended higher, with total transactions exceeding 1.9 million yuan. Consolidated and salt tax bonds each accounted for over 600,000, with the remaining issues seeing little activity. All bond issues for the July contract, except for the 96 Consolidated 6, saw trading, with slightly higher transaction volumes than before. Spot trading totaled 25,000 yuan, with 2.0 Customs bonds accounting for 14,000 yuan and the remainder very quiet. The relief reconstruction loan, which had been inactive for a long time, and the 1.9 Customs bond, each saw spot trading of 1,000 yuan. In terms of bond price trends, the market remained sluggish in the first two sessions, with prices continuing to weaken. Many bond issues fell further than the previous day. However, the market suddenly turned around in the afternoon, reportedly due to news of Finance Minister Song's reinstatement and the possibility of a compromise in the Guangdong conflict, leading to a better overall environment and improved market sentiment. Buying transactions were more active than in the morning. As a result, bond prices rebounded across the board. The 2.0 Customs and Consolidated Tax bonds rose by 8-9 jiao to 1.3-4 jiao, and other bonds also firmed slightly. Only a few issues, due to long periods of inactivity, remained lower in price. The bond market outlook has slightly changed.</p>

<p>Listed Yarn Plummets by 2.5 Tael</p>
<p>Long-Term Yarn at 144.1 Tael</p>
<p>The decline in cotton yarn is intensifying, reportedly due to the easing of raw cotton prices, making cotton yarn cheaper. Buyers are showing signs of unease, and actual demand has stagnated, causing market panic and a sharp decline in the overall market. Listed yarn broke through the 45-tael level in the afternoon, but the situation remains unfavorable. However, some believe there may be a slight rebound due to the excessive declines in recent days.</p>
<p>Listed Yarn Breaks Through 45 Tael: The morning opening of the listed yarn market saw a slight firmness in market sentiment due to the rise in U.S. cotton. Some traders covered their positions for various months, rising 5-6 qian. The second and third sessions trended downward. The result was a decline of 5 qian for each month. In the afternoon, the cotton yarn market became even more bearish due to unfavorable raw cotton prices, with declines ranging from 1.56 to 2.2 qian for each month. Total transactions for the day amounted to 36,200 bales. Gengfeng sold 1,000 bales, Tongyu 700 bales, Dachang 1,005 bales, Yongda 900 bales, Xincheng 1,350 bales, Yichang 900 bales, Yiyu 850 bales, and Rongxing 750 bales. Daji bought 800 bales, Heshen 900 bales, Renfeng 1,250 bales, Shenji 750 bales, and Tongxing 850 bales. The closing prices for the listed yarn are listed below:</p>

<p>Spot Yarn Sales are Less Than 300 Bales: The disposal of spot yarn is too slow. The statistics of all gangs bought a total of only 260 bales throughout the day. Fellow merchants entered 25 bales, mainland entered 100 bales, Guangdong entered 100 bales, Ningbo entered 10 bales, and the northern gang entered 5 bales.

<p>July Contract Opens at Only 27 Tael</p>
<p>The Cotton Market is Very Weak, and the Decline is Severe: Due to the unfavorable current situation for bullish traders and the suspension of purchases by various factories, market panic has intensified, and the decline is becoming more severe, with a feeling of plummeting prices. Although U.S. cotton has slightly risen, local market sentiment is difficult to sustain. However, after nine consecutive days of declines, the situation is very volatile. New buyers are not enthusiastic, and some believe there may be a slight rebound.</p>
<p>Near-Term Cotton Prices Decline by Over One Tael: The morning opening of the Zhengshang Exchange saw a rise in U.S. cotton, with increases of 2 qian for each month. The second and third sessions saw a significant decline, resulting in a decline of 5-6 qian for each. The market situation remained weak in the afternoon, with each month declining by another 2-3 qian. Total transactions for the day amounted to 84,200 dan. Changfeng sold 2,700 dan, Jifeng 2,500 dan, Gengfeng 2,200 dan, Yicheng 2,400 dan, Yuanda 2,200 dan, and Yuchang 5,200 dan.

<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, approximately 40 ships arrived from various gangs, with 180 ships stored in the port, totaling around 30,000 shi of cargo. The Changxi gang accounted for the majority. The market was cheaper than Xin Zha, with thick japonica and early and late indica rice each lower by 0.3 yuan. The middle market was particularly heavily discounted. Dozens of shi of foreign Lu tip rice were sold, declining by 0.15 yuan. The total volume of rice sold in the Huangpu River was around 600-700 shi throughout the day.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Yesterday, approximately 50 ships arrived at Xinzha West Road. Due to the end of the small lunar month, both firms were closing their accounts. There was very little demand. The opening prices of various goods fluctuated by around 0.2 yuan in the morning. Fresh Changkun white japonica rice was slightly loose, with the medium grade falling back by 0.2 yuan. Early and late indica rice and foreign tip rice and Yuan rice all experienced small declines of 0.2-0.3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Jiangxi Yuan Rice Continues to Arrive <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Rice Has an Outbound Route to Jiangbei</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice sales were still active, and the market remained firm. Mainland gangs continued to purchase rice, and Jiangbei gangs collected and loaded small bags. The local countryside also inquired about prices. The total market volume of small-bag rice was 3,000 bags, priced at 10.047-10.15 yuan. Red small-bag rice was 500 bags, priced at 9.45 yuan. Eggplant-colored brown rice was 700 bags, priced at 9.4 yuan. Annam japonica rice had average demand, with 700 bags sold yesterday. The quality was slightly lower, and the price also fell, opening at 12.5-12.15 yuan.</p>
<p>Jiangxi machine-milled Yuan rice has been very popular in the local market recently. Yesterday, a new batch arrived, with over 1,000 bags purchased by local businesses, priced at 14.7-13.8 yuan, and the lower grade at 13.2-13.3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Flour Prices Difficult to Sustain <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the quoted prices for foreign wheat fell by around 0.2-0.3 yuan, causing considerable market fatigue. Opening prices were unstable, with July only at 1.87 yuan. However, due to many bullish traders from outside the industry, unfavorable weather conditions, and factories continuing to restrict supply, buyers prevailed, and the market improved. Closing prices were better by around 0.05 yuan. By the afternoon opening, standard flour continued to decline, and actual sales remained as quiet as usual. In this environment, even the desire to maintain prices felt difficult, and as wheat eased, reducing costs, flour prices naturally became difficult to sustain. Therefore, market sentiment was flat and soft, with a general trend towards small declines. As a result, the July contract was down by 0.025 yuan, and the August to November contracts were down by 0.05 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Main Reasons for the Decline in Listed Wheat <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Quoted Prices for New Wheat in Production Areas are Easing</p>
<p>Financial Tightening and Sluggish Flour Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, all months trended towards a weak outlook again. The quoted prices for new wheat in various production areas were unexpectedly easing step by step. For example, the high-quality wheat from Wuxi has reached 5.15 yuan, down another 0.4 yuan from the price quoted a week ago. Other areas such as Danyang, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing also reported declines. It can be seen that financial tightening and sluggish flour sales are the main reasons for the wheat market's decline. The market was therefore very volatile, and July opening prices fell sharply, opening at 3.13 yuan, with August at 3.24 yuan. The unfavorable situation can easily be imagined. By the afternoon opening, transactions were very limited. Because the flour market was able to hold steady, the decline temporarily stopped. As a result, the July contract declined by 0.06 yuan, the August contract by 0.04 yuan, and the September contract by 0.02 yuan. The remaining months were not opened. New wheat continued to be loaded, but the factories were unwilling to offer prices. Three ships of Anting wheat arrived, but no transactions were made.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Sugar Market <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Sugar Market Sees Slight Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market at the Sugar Association saw continued low trading volume, with a feeling of even more sluggish purchasing power. 24-grade Dutch refined white sugar experienced a slight market decline, with a transaction price of 13.9 yuan, a particularly dim trend. Hong Kong goods were quoted at 13.8 yuan, and 20-grade medium-refined white sugar was at 13.5 yuan, with little interest. The market inventory of Dutch red and white bagged sugar was even thinner, and the market remained strong. Grade 9 goods were priced at 9.9 yuan, and slightly higher at 10 yuan. Taikoo sugar B mark was at 16.25 yuan. 250 bags of Tianjin Zhenxin goods were sold, priced at only 16.05 yuan. CW mark was at 15.9 yuan. Transactions were scattered, and the market outlook was stable. The remaining markets were very quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e269">North-South Goods <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>

<p>Orchid seeds have been out of stock for a long time, so Grade 3-4 goods have not been available for sale, and the market has been quiet. Yesterday, it was reported that Taikoo Company's Jinan ship arrived from Xiamen with a dozen or so items. If they are goods of good color and fragrance, they will</p>
<h3 id="e270">Metals <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>A Silent Scene in Metals</p>
<p>Metal transactions have been quiet recently because guest merchants are not buying much, and factories have little demand, resulting in a very quiet market. Prices in various markets have generally declined. The main items are listed below:</p>
<p>English Sheet Steel Supply Exceeds Demand: Recent transactions of English sheet steel have been very sluggish. Guest merchants and factories have not used up previous purchases, so there are no buyers. The supply is plentiful, exceeding demand, leading to a very inactive market. Prices are quite low. For example, 2.5-cent sheets are estimated at 8 taels, 2 maces and 5 candareens to 6 taels per dan (unit of weight); 7.5-cent sheets at 5 taels, 7 maces and 5 candareens; and 1-cent sheets at 5 taels and 2 maces. It is said that only sixty or seventy dan were sold on the market yesterday.</p>
<p>Refined Antimony’s Price Continues to Fall: Since foreign firms stopped trading, the market has been exceptionally quiet. There are reportedly large stocks in Shanghai, and prices are still expected to fall. Yesterday's sales were said to be only 185 taels per ton.</p>
<p>Pig Lead: A Strong Exterior, Weak Interior: Recently, overseas prices have been falling, so local prices have followed suit. Yesterday's estimate was 13 taels and 1 mace and 5 candareens, a decrease of 1 mace compared to the previous price. It is said that since help from outside stopped, factory business has been slow. Therefore, the market situation is unlikely to change soon. Although quoted prices are around 13 taels, 3 maces and 4 candareens, actual transactions are rare.</p>
<p>American Galvanized Iron Arriving Continuously: Sales of American galvanized iron have also been sluggish recently. Although prices are gradually decreasing, shipments continue to arrive. Besides inquiries, actual transactions are few. Currently, the market price for 48-gauge sheets is estimated at 15 taels, 38-gauge sheets at 14 taels and 7 maces and 5 candareens, 33-gauge sheets at 13 taels and 5 maces, and 25-gauge sheets at 12 taels and 5 maces.</p>

<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The other day, in the alley where I live, two Jiangbei children were fighting. One was stronger, the other weaker. The weaker child was beaten by the stronger child, his head was bleeding, and he cried loudly. The stronger child, fearing that bystanders would take up the cause, immediately comforted him with kind words and bought a piece of candy from a candy vendor, putting it in the weaker child’s mouth. The weaker child, his head still bleeding, wiped his hands, turned from sorrow to joy, and reconciled with the other child as if nothing had happened. In the end, both children parted in joy.</p>
<p>After the Shu Kingdom fell, Liu Shan moved his entire family to Luoyang. The Wei court enfeoffed him as the Duke of Anle. One day, at a banquet, the Wei court had Shu performers perform. Everyone else felt sorrowful, but Liu Shan smiled as if nothing had happened. Zhao said to Jia Chong, "This man is so devoid of emotion that even if Zhuge Liang were alive, he could not have supported him for long." He then asked Liu Shan, "Do you miss Shu?" Liu Shan replied, "I am happy here and do not miss Shu." In the end, they also parted in joy.</p>
<p>I saw a scene of parting in joy in my alley and another in history. It made me feel uneasy. According to a newspaper report yesterday, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu and Consul-General Murai, in view of the signing of the Shanghai Armistice Agreement, urgently sought to promote friendship between China and Japan. They hosted a banquet at Yue Nai’s house at 7 PM last night, inviting two important Chinese diplomatic officials, Guo Taiqi and Jiang Zuobin, to show their solidarity. During the banquet, they conversed happily, and discussions were lively. They parted in joy at 9 PM.</p>
<p>So that is what parting in joy is! Alas!</p>

<p>— Dream Box Master</p>
<p>With the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the Shanghai Incident has come to an end, but half of the Northeast remains in enemy hands. The government has no intention of recovering it, and the people of Shanghai are gradually forgetting it. Therefore, I have collected old news and written these four elegies for the Northeast to alert the people of the nation, lest I be accused of lamenting yesterday’s news.</p>

<p>In Shenyang city, there were one hundred thousand soldiers,</p>
<p>Camps were stationed south and north of the city.</p>
<p>At midnight, the bandits came and all the soldiers fled,</p>
<p>Four days were dark, without a sound of battle.</p>
<p>At dawn, they formed teams to search the wealthy households,</p>
<p>Breaking down doors like wolves, entering like tigers.</p>
<p>Mothers fled with their children, wives sought their husbands,</p>
<p>Our army was far away, in vain they cried out.</p>
<p>The blood and marrow of ten thousand families stained the mud,</p>
<p>They did not care about the scorched fish in the pond.</p>
<p>The treasures of Tianlu, four cabinets of books,</p>
<p>Were all stolen and loaded onto boats back to Penglai.</p>
<p>The majestic arsenal also fell into enemy hands,</p>
<p>Ten years of management, alas, what is the use?</p>
<p>I heard that the Eastern Army was a powerful force,</p>
<p>But why did it turn into a cowardly mouse overnight?</p>
<p>Great generals are not born, heroic men are sad,</p>
<p>The homeland is lost, tears fall like rain.</p>
<p>Do not sing the border city's White Goose Ballad,</p>
<p>The Great Marshal is still enjoying himself on the river.</p>

<p>Wherever the enemy army goes, the grass bends,</p>
<p>South of Changchun, there are no intact forts.</p>
<p>Surrendering to the enemy is too easy, killing the enemy is too rare,</p>
<p>The isolated city is defended solely by a lone army.</p>
<p>Two hundred and twenty men, none surrendered,</p>
<p>Their survival depends on the city’s survival, their death on its death.</p>
<p>Ten thousand horses press down on the city, and the city seems to move,</p>
<p>The brave soldiers on the city walls surge with energy.</p>
<p>Bathing in blood, they fight without retreat,</p>
<p>One man raises his arm, and a hundred men follow.</p>
<p>They ride their horses and slash into the enemy formation like flying dragons,</p>
<p>Together, they fight to the death to become heroic ghosts.</p>
<p>When they see the enemy, they shave their heads with sharp knives,</p>
<p>They maneuver left and right as they please.</p>
<p>Enemy soldiers who come are all brought to the ground,</p>
<p>Thousands of voices shout to kill the Japanese.</p>
<p>The Japanese are not all killed, more keep coming,</p>
<p>My strength is exhausted, what can I do?</p>
<p>After a day of hard fighting, their lives end together,</p>
<p>The bloody blade is still in their hands, their eyes still wide open.</p>
<p>Is this not my heart, but my integrity?</p>

<h3 id="e275">Manufacturing Methods for Several Daily Necessities <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Rust-Preventative Oil: Iron daily necessities are bright and lubricated when new, making them easy to use. After a while, they easily rust, losing their beauty and becoming unusable. Items such as kitchen knives require special attention to hygiene to prevent the spread of disease. Rust-preventative oil can prevent rust and decay, making it an indispensable item for daily use. The raw materials include 15 parts of resin, 500 parts of mica powder, 250 parts of lard, 45 parts of beeswax, and 45 parts each of olive oil and turpentine. The method involves placing the resin, lard, olive oil, and beeswax in an iron pot, melting them over low heat, and mixing well. Then, add the mica powder and remove from heat. Finally, add the turpentine and mix well.</p>
<p>Smelling Salts: The use of smelling salts is extremely common. They can be used to prevent epidemics and remove odors in both cities and villages. Residents of this city should have them on hand, as epidemics can easily occur after war. During the hot summer months, they are especially needed. The method involves using equal parts of charcoal, quicklime, and crude alum. Grind each of the three materials separately and place them in a glass bottle. When you want to use them, take a small amount of the powder, mix it with clean water, and sprinkle it in the corners of the room. This can prevent plagues and remove odors, and it is much cheaper than buying them on the market.</p>
<p>Silvered Glass: Silvered glass has many uses and is often sold in stores. The method involves using ammonia water, silver nitrate, and glucose in a ratio of 2:4:1, along with appropriate amounts of alcohol and clean water. Dissolve 6 parts each of ammonia water, silver nitrate, and alcohol water (i.e., six times the amount of glucose used) into a liquid, then filter to clarify it. Separately, dissolve 1 part each of glucose and alcohol water into a liquid. Mix this liquid with the previous liquid. Then, wash a glass object and immerse it in the successfully mixed liquid. After two or three days, it will turn into silvered glass.</p>

<p>— Ang Lian</p>
<p>A bustling wedding day had passed.</p>
<p>It was about midnight. G's mother and aunts sent him into the bridal chamber. The anxiety that had plagued him all day finally disappeared, thinking that from now on, it would be "a hundred years of harmony."</p>
<p>"G, you can get up a little later tomorrow. You look tired today," G's mother said gently as she stepped out the door.</p>
<p>G only responded with a "hmm." His head was heavy and throbbing, feeling like a homeless wandering soul. He saw the bride sitting on the edge of the bed adjusting her clothes, and a sudden thought surged into his heart, causing him to shiver.</p>
<p>"It's over!" he blurted out.</p>
<p>The bride was a little bewildered. She looked up and saw his face as if covered with frost, his eyes wide and frightening, staring at her as if possessed. She felt uneasy, unable to guess why he showed such grief. The wedding night should be filled with curiosity and sweetness.</p>
<p>Outside the window, a light rain began to fall, making her feel even more unhappy. Suddenly, she heard a sob coming from the groom who was slumped on the table. The sorrowful weeping, in the dead of night, faintly resembled the pain of a wounded beast. She had never heard a man cry so terribly, and she shivered slightly.</p>
<p>"This is a very bad omen!" she thought.</p>
<p>Two o'clock had passed. The crying had stopped, but she was still waiting for him on the edge of the bed, feeling impatient and very tired. She began to feel hatred towards him. After his crying stopped, she sat motionless like a stone statue, afraid to disturb him. She was shy, and she wondered how a country girl could easily be the first to speak to him. But he was a man, wasn't he being unreasonable? A terrible image enveloped her heart. She felt like an abandoned woman.</p>
<p>"Maybe he doesn't think I'm pretty, so he..." she worried, thinking over and over. She felt so sleepy that she could no longer bear to wait.</p>
<p>Three o'clock, four o'clock... had passed. The night dragged on.</p>
<p>When she woke up, she rubbed her sleepy eyes and felt around her. Was anyone there? No? The sun was shining in through the window. The chair was empty. G had left sometime.</p>
<p>While she was washing up, her mother-in-law brought a letter, her face full of tears, and said, "He's gone! G ran away last night!" Her mother-in-law sobbed.</p>
<p>"..." The bride couldn't speak. She realized that the bad omen had come true. It seemed that her fate was predetermined. She was an abandoned woman. But who had abandoned her? Was it G, or her parents? Her mind was confused.</p>
<p>G's father rushed in and opened G's letter to read.</p>
<p>"Goodbye! My parents! I would rather sacrifice my studies, I would rather not have the family provide for my life, I would rather suffer in the dark society, than submit to the inhumane feudal etiquette and the iron heel of the all-evil money of this society, to marry a woman I do not know and do not love. Goodbye, forgive me for sullying your family's 'good reputation.' Your son, G."</p>
<p>"Etiquette..." The bride seemed to hear these two new words. She felt a wave of dizziness and fell down...</p>

<p>— Yi Xue</p>
<p>Because his wife was sick, he asked for a few extra days off from his work. The high-nosed boss put on the face of a capitalist and fired him.</p>
<p>A year ago, introduced by a good classmate, he passed the exam and entered this high-nosed foreigner's firm. He brought his newlywed wife from the countryside and rented a small room. Although the salary at the firm was small, they lived frugally. The life of a husband and wife could be maintained. Half a year later, a son was born. They loved this crystallization of love even more. Every day he saved on transportation costs to buy nutritious food for his son.</p>
<p>This happiness amidst hardship was enough to make them content. His wife! Perhaps due to overwork, or perhaps because the small room in the three-story alley building built by capitalists had too polluted air, she contracted a seasonal epidemic. In that small room, he had to protect his son from coming into contact with the patient, and he also had to take care of his wife. Shanghai doctors who didn't gouge were not famous doctors. A small clerk in a foreign firm was of course unable to cope. Their finances became panicked. At first, they could still pawn things to get by. After a week, the high-nosed boss sent him a letter because he had taken too much leave, firing him. In his confused state of mind, he didn't even think about what he would do in the future. The most important thing was how to get through the present. He had no choice but to borrow from closer relatives. As the saying goes, "Few give charcoal in the snow, old faces have no shame in adding flowers to brocade." Seeing his poor appearance, they didn't even offer ordinary perfunctory words, sending him away coldly.</p>
<p>He walked forward aimlessly, wandering to the Huangpu River. Looking at the rolling river, he lamented how many heroes and heroines were buried in it. He himself had a bellyful of talent, but he couldn't even support his wife and son. He was just thinking of lightly jumping in, which would end all his troubles, but a shocking wooden sign from the Social Bureau caught his eye: "You must not die, turn back!" He shook his head and wanted to run home quickly. He seemed to hear someone say to him, "Your wife is sick, your son is hungry, if you don't die, what will you do!"</p>
<p>A burst of waves suddenly arose in the still river, circles of waves slowly enlarging to infinity.</p>

<h3 id="e282">An Overview of the New Ford <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>13 Million Visitors</p>
<p>Since its debut, the new Ford car has shone brightly in the automotive world. In addition to announcing the various reforms and excellent features of the new car to the world, the factory has also distributed sample cars to dealers, displaying them widely in major cities to attract attention. According to the American Automotive Business News, since Ford dealers displayed the new car models in their showrooms, tens of thousands of people have visited and inspected the new cars daily. As of recently, the total number of visitors has reached as many as 13 million. Furthermore, according to Mr. Crow, the Chinese manager of Ford, 300,000 units of the new Ford V8 car displayed in various places were immediately ordered by visitors, which shows that the excellent quality of the new car has deeply impressed people. An independent automotive publication praised the new car as representing the progress and success of Ford's 29 years of car-making experience, and stated that its innovations and improvements are entirely based on its historical practice and the integration of various strengths.</p>
<p>Before the emergence of the Ford V8 and four-cylinder new cars, the factory had been preparing and operating for several months. It employed over 100,000 workers to manufacture the new cars. According to the "Automobile Daily," Ford's eagerness to launch the new cars was due to the personal encouragement of President Hoover, who deeply knew that the increase in car sales could actually make the recovery of the United States' prosperity easier. According to Ford himself, the V8 new car he manufactured has extremely sufficient horsepower, but its management is simple and easy, just like the two characteristics of its speed and power. As for its pricing, it is based on the principle that both buyers and sellers get their fair share. Ford also said that he did not care about the cost of manufacturing. If he had to consider it, the price would inevitably increase accordingly. However, in this economic downturn, how could the selling price be increased again? Therefore, time and money are not taken into account. His responsibility is only to find ways to allow workers to have work to do as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to expressing the above views, Ford also said that in addition to the V8 new car with 65 horsepower, Ford also makes a four-cylinder car with 50 horsepower. Cars with various cylinder numbers have 14 different body styles. These two four-cylinder and eight-cylinder cars have no significant differences other than the structure of the engine. The body and frame are the same, but their prices are different. Because the V8 car will be listed among low-priced cars, the price of the four-cylinder car is even cheaper than the V8 car. Ford said that the reason why the company does this is to serve the public who use cars, and to provide buyers with cheap and good cars in the autumn of economic instability.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the new car cannot be fully described for a while. To list the most obvious ones, there is the silent simultaneous action gear lever, silent gears, rubber-coated engine, carbonized silencer, automatic spark management, a bulkhead pump that inputs fuel from the rear fuel tank to the engine. In addition, there are flexible and bendable upper arm springs, new rear springs, automatic self-adjusting Hale double-action hydraulic shock absorbers, large four-wheel brakes, and new electric forged steel spoke wheels with large hubs and hubcaps and large wheel rims. Rubber is used as insulation between the frame and the gears, so that the movement of the springs and links does not affect the body. Rubber is also embedded between the body and the frame.</p>
<p>The style of the body from the V-shaped radiator to the rear end is exceptionally fresh and beautiful. The long head is streamlined and has stainless steel straight lines. The windshield has inclined safety glass. The roof is rounded. Other features such as the protruding headlights, the front fender guard, and the low and long footboard are all coordinated and aesthetically pleasing with the whole body. The interior of the carriage is very spacious. The decoration is also extremely luxurious. The seats are new and quite comfortable. The driver's seat can be adjusted in all sedans. There is a ventilation device on the roof. The instrument panel is oval and lined with stainless steel sheets. All sedans have folding sun visors.</p>
<p>Ford's V-shaped engine has an angle of 90 degrees and has a power of 30 horsepower, a braking force of 65 horsepower, and 3,400 revolutions per minute. The pistons are made of aluminum alloy and have three ring loops. The lower one is used for oil control. The cylinder head and crankcase are cast together, making the structure very strong. The new valve tail is shaped like a bamboo mat and is operated by a crankshaft. The engine does not use intermediate gears. Spark management is automatic. The lubrication of the crankcase and crankpins is caused by pressure. The lubrication of the pistons and valves uses the splash method. The fan in the cooling system is designed as an airplane dark wheel and has an off-center water pump and a wide-gas heat dissipation method. Therefore, no matter how the car travels, it can maintain its cooling effect.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Automobile Driving Knowledge <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Weilie</p>
<p>Due to the arrival of summer, the wheel tracks of cars on the road are denser than at other times. The occurrence of tragedies is also much higher than at other times. In view of the occurrence of various unfortunate incidents in the past, the Motor Vehicle Department of the Public Works Bureau has newly promulgated several driving tips. Those who like to sit in cars for a ride, that is, all those who drive cars, please pay attention to the new suggestions below and use them as a warning for driving.</p>
<p>(1) Speed. Driving fast can be said to be the cause of accidents, but it is not the main culprit. The most important thing is to match the speed with the environment. Often, at the same speed, there is a distinction between stable and dangerous due to different situations. Therefore, those who like to drive fast must always pay attention to everything around them.</p>
<p>(2) Hand Signals. When you raise your hand to signal, you must be consistent in mind and action. If your hand signals are clear and accurate, then no matter when stopping, turning, or driving onto another intersection, there will never be an unfortunate incident.</p>
<p>(3) Overtaking. If you do not have sufficient time or complete certainty, do not cross your car forward when vehicles are crowded on an intersection.</p>
<p>(4) Safe Distance. The car in front of you may suddenly stop. You must always maintain a considerable distance to avoid the misfortune of a collision.</p>
<p>(5) Sudden Stops. Except in cases of absolute necessity, do not suddenly stop your vehicle. You must remember that there are other vehicles following behind you.</p>
<p>(6) On the Tracks. Although there are gates and warning signs on the railway tracks, or pipe workers guarding them, you must pay attention yourself and treat yourself as a patrol officer.</p>
<p>(7) Traffic Signals (Traffic Lights, etc.). Traffic signals are set up for your safety. If you destroy traffic signals for a very short time, then the unfortunate fact is the result.</p>
<p>(8) New Routes. When driving on roads that you do not often visit, you must always pay attention. Unexpected disturbances may hit you unexpectedly.</p>

<h3 id="e284">Overview of Henan Province Highways <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>Black Fox</p>
<p>Transportation is essential for enlightening the people and developing industry, and highways are especially a shortcut to facilitate transportation and achieve twice the result with half the effort. Henan Province is adjacent to Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, seven provinces. It is the center of culture and industry in our country. Although there is now the Longhai Railway, which connects Jiangsu in the east and Shaanxi in the west, and the Pinghan Railway, which connects Hebei in the north and Hubei in the south, the western and eastern parts of Henan are still mostly blocked. Therefore, industry is still stagnant, culture remains backward, and bandits cannot be suppressed. To this day, people's lives are becoming increasingly impoverished. Therefore, developing transportation and building provincial highways should be the province's only top priority. The following is an overview of the Henan Provincial Highway Bureau's planned implementation of construction and the status of roads that have already been opened to traffic for reference by those who are enthusiastic about road administration.</p>

It is crucial to connect the transportation of Shandong, Henan, and Hubei provinces. It should be completed in the first phase of construction. Passing through the old Yellow River course, the Jialu River, the Shuangji River, the Ying River, the Ru River, the Rufen River, the Feng River, the Zhan River, the Hun River, the Sanli River, the Mazi River, the Yanshanpu River, the Pan River, the Zhao River, the Bai River, the Liao River, the Tuan River, the Xiajia River, and other rivers, there are no formal bridges. In addition to the original 29 bridges, which should be usable, another 23 solid bridges should be added. A total of 68 culverts should be added and repaired along the entire line, laying 57 cement water pipes. The earthwork volume is 993,100 cubic meters. (2) An Shang Line. From the Hebei provincial border, passing through Fenglezhen, Anyang, Tangyin, Junxian, Daokou, Fengqiu, Kaifeng, Chenliu, Qixian, Taikang, Huaiyang, Xiangcheng, Xincai, Huangchuan, Shangcheng, reaching the Hubei provincial border, the entire line is over 1,280 li in length. In the first phase, the An Shang section will be constructed first. This section is the only main line in southeastern Henan Province, from Kaifeng to the Hubei provincial border, with a total length of over 950 li. Extremely solid large bridges will be built across the Shahe, Banghe, Bailu River, and Quhe rivers to facilitate traffic. There are a total of 164 bridges and culverts of various sizes on the entire road, laying 126 water pipes. The earthwork volume is 1,577,200 cubic meters. (3) Shan San Line. From the Shanxi provincial border, passing through Shaanxian, Lushi, Jingziguan (Shaanxi provincial border), Zhechuan, Dengxian, Xinye, Tongbai, Xinyang, Luoshan, Huangchuan, Gushi, reaching Sanhejian, Anhui Province</p>
